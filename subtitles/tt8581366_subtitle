1
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,360
You&#39;re shaving the wrong wire.

2
00:01:26,693 --> 00:01:27,818
The heart isn&#39;t lit yet.

3
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:30,485
The guests will arrive any second. Light up the heart.

4
00:01:35,235 --> 00:01:36,485
I can&#39;t do it.

5
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,693
You do it.

6
00:01:38,818 --> 00:01:40,151
Listen to me, buddy.

7
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:42,651
Leave me. - What&#39;s wrong with him?

8
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,985
What&#39;s wrong with him?

9
00:01:47,068 --> 00:01:51,109
The heart&#39;s lit. up.

10
00:01:51,651 --> 00:01:54,401
The guests have arrived. Come, everyone. - The guests are here.

11
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,526
So my brother, which box has...

12
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,901
...has gold? - You idiot, its box no. 8.

13
00:02:13,276 --> 00:02:15,360
The prize money is in that box. You just wait and watch, uncle.

14
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:17,818
No. 9.

15
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:19,276
This gentleman is saying no. 9. - He&#39;s done for.

16
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
Should I open it? - He&#39;s lost it.

17
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,860
Let&#39;s open no. 8 and see what&#39;s in it.

18
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,651
Okay. 1...2...

19
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,818
He has lost the gold.

20
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,526
See, didn&#39;t I tell you? Stupid.

21
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,526
Your guesses are always correct.

22
00:02:36,235 --> 00:02:38,443
Believe me, uncle.

23
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:41,151
If I ever go on this show, I will win everything.

24
00:02:41,235 --> 00:02:42,818
Stop showing off.

25
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,860
Aww... My daughter is blessed with good luck.

26
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,193
But why are you covering it? Move it aside. Move it aside.

27
00:02:50,276 --> 00:02:53,276
Mom, you ruined my entire style.

28
00:02:54,568 --> 00:02:58,360
Come, let&#39;s go. Come on.

29
00:03:00,651 --> 00:03:02,943
Raje, what are you doing here?

30
00:03:03,026 --> 00:03:04,568
We&#39;re going to attend the wedding.

31
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,026
You go, I don&#39;t want to go. - Why?

32
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,360
Because I don&#39;t want to.

33
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:10,110
I haven&#39;t cooked food.

34
00:03:10,443 --> 00:03:13,401
Lets go and have dinner at wedding ... - I am not hungry, just go.

35
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:15,860
Let&#39;s go, mom.

36
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:17,901
We&#39;re getting late. - Yes, let&#39;s go. - Don&#39;t forget to lock the door, Raje.

37
00:03:40,026 --> 00:03:41,901
Raje. Buddy.

38
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:44,276
I&#39;ve brought food for you.

39
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,901
Along with cold drink

40
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,443
Let&#39;s eat together.

41
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,901
Take a look.

42
00:03:50,235 --> 00:03:53,068
The food&#39;s waiting or you to eat them.

43
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:54,860
Bro.

44
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,610
You shouldn&#39;t disrespect them.

45
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,026
It always brings bad luck.

46
00:04:00,235 --> 00:04:03,151
Raje. Your love&#39;s gone cold.

47
00:04:03,818 --> 00:04:05,401
Don&#39;t let the rice go cold as well.

48
00:04:06,651 --> 00:04:07,860
Leave me alone.

49
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:11,860
What&#39;s the point of crying now?

50
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,818
You preferred being a silent lover when you should&#39;ve said something.

51
00:04:15,151 --> 00:04:16,235
And never said a word.

52
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:17,692
You should forget her now.

53
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:19,400
What could I do?

54
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:21,526
What could I do?

55
00:04:22,526 --> 00:04:23,901
My hands were tied.

56
00:04:25,443 --> 00:04:28,193
I couldn&#39;t get married until sister Baby doesn&#39;t get married.

57
00:04:29,818 --> 00:04:32,235
If I had said anything to mother, she would&#39;ve insulted me again.

58
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,193
Father passed away.

59
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:39,860
But he burdened me with all the responsibilities.

60
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,818
And she left me today.

61
00:04:43,193 --> 00:04:44,651
She left me.

62
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,693
My love has become someone&#39;s wife.

63
00:04:54,776 --> 00:04:57,401
&#39;Seeing Raja&#39;s condition I couldn&#39;t eat.&#39;

64
00:04:57,776 --> 00:04:59,860
&#39;But then we can&#39;t blame the food.&#39;

65
00:05:02,818 --> 00:05:05,860
&#39;A guy cries only twice in lifetime.

66
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:09,943
&#39;Either he&#39;s got broken bones or a broken heart.&#39;

67
00:05:11,276 --> 00:05:13,943
&#39;And Raja&#39;s heart was completely shattered.&#39;

68
00:05:15,026 --> 00:05:16,651
&#39;After all, she was her childhood love.&#39;

69
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:18,943
&#39;Childhood love&#39;

70
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:20,901
&#39;But one-sided.&#39;

71
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,026
&#39;It was springtime.&#39;

72
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,360
&#39;Everyone was busy flying kites.&#39;

73
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:31,818
&#39;And we were busy stealing them.&#39;

74
00:05:40,276 --> 00:05:45,693
&#39;Raja had sworn that he will steal all the kites in the city.&#39;

75
00:05:55,193 --> 00:05:59,526
&#39;And he gave a nightmare to so many crockery sellers.&#39;

76
00:06:21,151 --> 00:06:23,693
&#39;But as soon as one of Meeru&#39;s bangles got broken...&#39;

77
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,110
&#39;...Raja&#39;s speed hit a speed breaker.&#39;

78
00:06:33,318 --> 00:06:36,026
Raja, hurry up, Otherwise shafiq will steak the kite.

79
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:42,276
&#39;He left a crying Meeru behind.&#39;

80
00:06:43,818 --> 00:06:46,318
&#39;But he left his heart behind.&#39;

81
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:54,651
&#39;And then...&#39;

82
00:06:54,901 --> 00:06:57,110
&#39;Just like a clergy&#39;s destination is finally the mosque.&#39;

83
00:06:57,568 --> 00:07:01,776
&#39;Similarly, Raja&#39;s destination was Meeru&#39;s roof.&#39;

84
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:27,318
&#39;Now Raja couldn&#39;t steal any more kites.&#39;

85
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,860
&#39;Because someone had stolen his heart instead.&#39;

86
00:07:36,568 --> 00:07:42,985
&#39;As the size of the bangles grew, so did Raja&#39;s love.&#39;

87
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,568
&#39;The time had come to express his love...&#39;

88
00:07:51,276 --> 00:07:54,068
&#39;...which Raja couldn&#39;t do till date.&#39;

89
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,651
I wish you could say &#39;I love you&#39; just as fast as him.

90
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:08,568
...then you would&#39;ve had three kids by now.

91
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,360
In fact, one of them would&#39;ve been taller than you.

92
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,610
&#39;Valentine fever was slowly gripping the city of Nirali.&#39;

93
00:08:17,276 --> 00:08:19,401
&#39;And Raja&#39;s heart was stiff scared.&#39;

94
00:08:19,818 --> 00:08:22,443
&#39;What if someone says "I Love You" to Meeru?&#39;

95
00:08:24,818 --> 00:08:27,443
Wow, Billo will be impressed with this.

96
00:08:27,818 --> 00:08:32,193
&#39;So even he wrote a love letter, and wore a red sweater.&#39;

97
00:08:33,193 --> 00:08:36,818
&#39;And made up his mind that he&#39;ll finally say it today.&#39;

98
00:08:38,693 --> 00:08:41,651
&#39;He mustered some courage and went to Meeru&#39;s neighborhood.&#39;

99
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,818
Raje. Your father met with an accident.

100
00:09:20,443 --> 00:09:22,401
Brothers are like fathers to their sister.

101
00:09:23,068 --> 00:09:29,151
From today, Baby&#39;s marriage and this family is your responsibility, son.

102
00:09:30,276 --> 00:09:33,318
Bless you, my son, bless you.

103
00:09:34,485 --> 00:09:38,610
&#39;Raja&#39;s love was crushed under the burdens of his responsibility.&#39;

104
00:09:39,443 --> 00:09:43,985
After which he couldn&#39;t express or show his love.&#39;

105
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,526
&#39;Poor Raja.&#39;

106
00:10:06,735 --> 00:10:09,526
Raje. Raje. Raje.

107
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,943
Turn that thing off.

108
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,818
Raje, this is my third trip to your shop.

109
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,276
Pay up the committee money.

110
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,151
You owe me for last month as well.

111
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,526
These things take time.

112
00:10:20,776 --> 00:10:21,860
Give me my money!

113
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,193
Here&#39;s 4000.

114
00:10:32,193 --> 00:10:33,110
And this is your full payment.

115
00:10:34,193 --> 00:10:35,860
When will be my turn?

116
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,985
Never .... - You turn will come as well.

117
00:10:38,068 --> 00:10:39,985
Only last 5 committees are left.

118
00:10:42,235 --> 00:10:44,860
Okay, Nazire, see you in the evening at the usual spot.

119
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:55,110
You went to talk about Farhana.

120
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,485
How did Raje&#39;s income come into all this?

121
00:10:57,568 --> 00:11:02,026
Rashida, don&#39;t try to be naive.

122
00:11:02,443 --> 00:11:06,443
Your status will be measured by your son&#39;s income.

123
00:11:06,526 --> 00:11:09,026
For example the things can you give your daughter in dowry?

124
00:11:10,026 --> 00:11:12,776
You know are status pretty well.

125
00:11:12,818 --> 00:11:15,151
And we won&#39;t send her empty-handed.

126
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,610
We&#39;ll give what others are giving.

127
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:20,276
Let&#39;s not talk about the world.

128
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:23,693
They give cars and plots in dowry.

129
00:11:23,818 --> 00:11:26,985
Let&#39;s not talk about others, and talk about yourself.

130
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:31,651
I know you can&#39;t give a car.

131
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:34,526
But think about giving a motorcycle.

132
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,443
So that I can take this proposal ahead.

133
00:11:39,235 --> 00:11:40,568
Okay.

134
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:45,443
I&#39;ll tell Raja to put a motorcycle on the list.

135
00:11:45,526 --> 00:11:46,485
Yes.

136
00:11:46,568 --> 00:11:47,901
That&#39;s more like it.

137
00:11:48,443 --> 00:11:53,110
You know, your daughter has already been rejected four times.

138
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,526
The more people we approach for our child, the more difficult it will get.

139
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:03,401
Okay.

140
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:06,860
Okay. Give it a thought and call me later.

141
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:10,443
And in case you don&#39;t have balance, give me a missed call.

142
00:12:10,526 --> 00:12:11,818
I have a package.

143
00:12:11,943 --> 00:12:14,235
Goodbye. I&#39;ll call you back.

144
00:12:18,485 --> 00:12:20,110
Salam, Aunty. - Salam, Farhana.

145
00:12:20,193 --> 00:12:21,318
Come here, child.

146
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:25,360
Why did you upload pictures of yourself as cat and dog on Facebook?

147
00:12:25,443 --> 00:12:28,568
Earlier people used to question around for information.

148
00:12:28,651 --> 00:12:30,360
But God knows where this Facebook has come From,...

149
00:12:30,443 --> 00:12:31,818
...where they get all the information.

150
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:35,651
And listen, you should lose some weight as well.

151
00:12:42,151 --> 00:12:47,360
&#39;As soon as aunty leaves, mom&#39;s advises would start.&#39;

152
00:12:50,526 --> 00:12:53,860
Baby, leave that phone alone. Better mend your ways.

153
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,360
Drink less tea.

154
00:12:58,443 --> 00:12:59,860
It&#39;s hampering your complexion.

155
00:12:59,901 --> 00:13:01,068
You should eat less.

156
00:13:01,276 --> 00:13:03,401
Slim girls get more proposals.

157
00:13:07,068 --> 00:13:11,568
&#39;Poor sister Baby, she would try really hard.&#39;

158
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,068
&#39;But her weight was stuck just like this cycle.&#39;

159
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:24,860
Why didn&#39;t you send me a selfie?

160
00:13:25,068 --> 00:13:26,526
I stayed up all night.

161
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:28,901
You didn&#39;t check your WhatsApp either.

162
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,068
Yes.

163
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:32,318
I just recharged 100 rupees yesterday.

164
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:33,401
And it&#39;s over already.

165
00:13:33,485 --> 00:13:36,068
Have you been talking to someone else?

166
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:37,485
I was just joking.

167
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:40,860
Don&#39;t say such things. I won&#39;t be able to work.

168
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,943
Don&#39;t say it, I&#39;ll get the shock of my life.

169
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,401
Raje.

170
00:13:47,485 --> 00:13:49,026
Raje.

171
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,526
Who invited him here?

172
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,901
Isn&#39;t she ashamed?

173
00:13:51,985 --> 00:13:55,735
Where did she come from? - Look at her.

174
00:14:07,318 --> 00:14:08,485
Hello, aunty.

175
00:14:09,651 --> 00:14:10,943
Hello.

176
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,818
Congratulations, I just found out today.

177
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:14,818
Where is the bride?

178
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,485
She didn&#39;t even call to inform me.

179
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:17,860
Listen...

180
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:20,193
where do you think you&#39;re going?

181
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,526
To meet Rabia.

182
00:14:22,401 --> 00:14:25,151
You think you should meet her?

183
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,651
What?

184
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:33,068
People says that a widow should stay away from the bride.

185
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,026
And you&#39;re a smart girl.

186
00:14:38,985 --> 00:14:40,651
You wouldn&#39;t wish ill for her.

187
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,776
Yes, aunty.

188
00:14:56,818 --> 00:14:58,235
They are all stupid.

189
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,151
They don&#39;t understand the will of God.

190
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:04,610
Only I saw your tears glittering in the dark.

191
00:15:06,443 --> 00:15:10,901
Tomorrow when fate smiles on you, the entire city will witness it.

192
00:15:11,318 --> 00:15:12,443
I swear.

193
00:15:35,026 --> 00:15:36,818
No-No-No.

194
00:15:37,193 --> 00:15:38,360
Don&#39;t even think about it.

195
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:41,151
It&#39;s not possible, Raje.

196
00:15:42,026 --> 00:15:43,610
She has come back.

197
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:45,818
Forget her.

198
00:15:46,068 --> 00:15:47,651
How can you love a widow?

199
00:15:47,985 --> 00:15:50,901
Two people should be equal to make a couple

200
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:53,360
Stupid lover, falling for a widow.

201
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:56,110
Her husband died on the Wedding night.

202
00:15:56,485 --> 00:15:58,901
Imagine how ill fated she is.

203
00:16:00,485 --> 00:16:02,276
She doesn&#39;t have an ill fate...

204
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,110
...it&#39;s me my good luck...

205
00:16:05,943 --> 00:16:07,485
...because she has come back.

206
00:16:09,151 --> 00:16:13,151
When you make a wish from your heart, even God answers.

207
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:17,485
I am going to marry Meeru.

208
00:16:18,151 --> 00:16:21,443
Cheap Romeo, your mother will never agree.

209
00:16:22,651 --> 00:16:26,276
Always marry the one your heart chooses

210
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,818
And when my heart&#39;s chosen her, then it&#39;s the will of God.

211
00:16:51,902 --> 00:16:53,152
Mother.

212
00:16:54,777 --> 00:16:56,277
I want to get married.

213
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,860
What...?

214
00:16:58,235 --> 00:16:59,360
Get me married.

215
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:02,235
My son.

216
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:05,319
Even I want to see you get married.

217
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:09,235
But once your sister gets married, then you&#39;re next in line.

218
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,485
You&#39;ve been saying that for six years, mom.

219
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:14,194
I&#39;ve been telling you to save up for the dowry for six years.

220
00:17:14,277 --> 00:17:16,569
If you had listened, then your sister would&#39;ve been married by now.

221
00:17:16,694 --> 00:17:19,902
The kind of things people ask for, it will take me more than 10 years.

222
00:17:19,985 --> 00:17:21,610
Curse you.

223
00:17:22,152 --> 00:17:23,569
Be quiet! Be quiet!

224
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:25,734
Why are you saying such negative things in the morning?

225
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:29,610
If your sister hears you, she will be heartbroken.

226
00:17:29,902 --> 00:17:31,235
Think about her.

227
00:17:31,444 --> 00:17:34,819
She is growing old. - So am I.

228
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,819
All my friends are married.

229
00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:38,319
They keeping mocking me.

230
00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:41,027
And you know, Safiq&#39;s son is going to Primary school now.

231
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,819
No one cares about the age of a man.

232
00:17:42,944 --> 00:17:44,944
You&#39;ll get someone even when you&#39;re 40.

233
00:17:45,027 --> 00:17:47,277
No, mother. I can&#39;t wait until I am 40.

234
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,819
Let me get marry now ...

235
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,152
Then you can poison your sister.

236
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:52,985
And get married at her funeral.

237
00:17:53,902 --> 00:17:55,819
Listen carefully, Raje.

238
00:17:56,069 --> 00:17:58,610
Until your sister doesn&#39;t get married,...

239
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,527
...don&#39;t even think about getting married yourself.

240
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:02,235
What kind of a mother are you?

241
00:18:02,444 --> 00:18:04,360
Don&#39;t you understand my feelings at all?

242
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:05,860
What do you want?

243
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:07,235
Do you want me to stay unmarried?

244
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,985
And end up like uncle Khalil.

245
00:18:14,902 --> 00:18:18,360
&#39;Now...that&#39;s the brink of getting humiliated.&#39;

246
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:22,735
&#39;Uncle was overwhelmed with embarrassment even before he could take a bath.&#39;

247
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:38,027
Meeru, help Bilal wear his shoes.

248
00:18:38,277 --> 00:18:39,569
Yes, sister.

249
00:18:41,194 --> 00:18:43,319
When are they sending the dowry back?

250
00:18:46,444 --> 00:18:53,152
It sounds weird asking them for the dowry back.

251
00:18:53,444 --> 00:18:54,819
What do you mean?

252
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,860
You didn&#39;t call them yet?

253
00:18:57,194 --> 00:18:58,610
I...

254
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:02,360
They had no shame in sending our girl back.

255
00:19:02,985 --> 00:19:05,777
And you&#39;re feeling embarrassed to ask for the dowry back.

256
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:09,860
Try to remember, Humera. We spared no expenses.

257
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:12,819
I am still repaying the money I borrowed from the committee.

258
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,777
Finally, I was rid of this burden, but then your sister came back.

259
00:19:18,027 --> 00:19:20,444
Call them today and tell them to send the stuff back.

260
00:19:22,277 --> 00:19:24,777
Brother-in-law, I wanted to talk.

261
00:19:26,777 --> 00:19:27,902
Go on.

262
00:19:27,985 --> 00:19:30,069
I wanted your permission.

263
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:33,110
What permission?

264
00:19:33,985 --> 00:19:35,944
I&#39;ve been offered a job as a Polio-worker.

265
00:19:37,152 --> 00:19:38,485
The pay is good.

266
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:45,777
Ask your sister.

267
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:23,860
Sorry uncle, in a fit of rage I...

268
00:20:24,235 --> 00:20:26,027
I didn&#39;t mean what I said.

269
00:20:26,235 --> 00:20:28,527
And even mom... - Let it be.

270
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:32,902
You were telling the truth.

271
00:20:34,777 --> 00:20:36,527
It wasn&#39;t my cup of tea.

272
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:40,152
Is this how you love?

273
00:20:41,777 --> 00:20:43,819
Love is for the brave.

274
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,527
People have done the impossible.

275
00:20:49,694 --> 00:20:51,194
Set examples.

276
00:20:53,444 --> 00:20:55,694
A coward like me couldn&#39;t have done any of those.

277
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,194
I took too long.

278
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,485
I would go to see her every day.

279
00:21:15,735 --> 00:21:19,319
"I could recognize the tinkle of her trinkets from miles away.&#39;

280
00:21:25,694 --> 00:21:28,735
"The winter sun would rise only to see her.&#39;

281
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,694
Her smile stops the river current&#39;

282
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:38,735
"Her complexion was brighter than the golden fields of wheat.&#39;

283
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,819
"She was sweeter than sweet.&#39;

284
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:55,569
"Every day I would travel to her village thinking that I will tell her today.&#39;

285
00:21:56,444 --> 00:22:00,860
"I will show her that I am her lover."

286
00:22:07,444 --> 00:22:10,069
"But as soon as she would look at me..."

287
00:22:11,277 --> 00:22:13,277
"...I would lose my mind."

288
00:22:28,944 --> 00:22:31,152
"My heart would beat so loudly..."

289
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:34,110
"...like an express train speeding away on the tracks.&#39;

290
00:22:36,402 --> 00:22:38,944
"But time was speeding faster.&#39;

291
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,527
&#39;This feeling took me all the way to her threshold...&#39;

292
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:49,610
&#39;But, it was too late.&#39;

293
00:22:51,485 --> 00:22:53,694
&#39;Time had won.&#39;

294
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:05,694
So son, when you can&#39;t express your feelings to your love...

295
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,569
...then you have no right to live.

296
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:25,402
Friends, love is about loving someone unconditionally.

297
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:29,194
And it isn&#39;t about desiring her either.

298
00:23:30,194 --> 00:23:34,194
Listeners love is the most invaluable thing in this world...

299
00:23:34,652 --> 00:23:39,110
...and once you fall in love, you can&#39;t love someone else.

300
00:23:40,277 --> 00:23:46,735
Our next song is for those who love someone, and they are restless to tell them...

301
00:23:47,444 --> 00:23:48,694
...but they are scared to do so.

302
00:28:05,027 --> 00:28:06,819
Yes, it&#39;s this one.

303
00:28:11,444 --> 00:28:13,027
Listen.

304
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,610
I wanted to talk to you.

305
00:28:17,735 --> 00:28:19,444
I had something to say.

306
00:28:22,152 --> 00:28:23,277
Yes.

307
00:28:29,735 --> 00:28:31,485
I am the bangle-guy.

308
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,985
I&#39;ve been in love with you since childhood.

309
00:28:41,444 --> 00:28:42,902
But I could never say it.

310
00:28:43,277 --> 00:28:44,777
I could never muster the courage.

311
00:28:45,069 --> 00:28:49,819
Mother said I cannot get married until my sister doesn&#39;t get married.

312
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,527
So is your sister married now?

313
00:28:55,277 --> 00:28:56,402
No.

314
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:57,944
But I have finally mustered some courage now.

315
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,360
I will convince my mother.

316
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,694
I won&#39;t let you go now.

317
00:29:01,985 --> 00:29:03,944
You came back because of my prayers.

318
00:29:04,027 --> 00:29:06,027
Your husband won&#39;t die every day...

319
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,819
Meeru.

320
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,610
Why did it happen, sister?

321
00:30:23,902 --> 00:30:25,360
Why?

322
00:30:25,819 --> 00:30:28,235
Why me? Why me?

323
00:30:29,152 --> 00:30:30,944
Don&#39;t say that, Meeru.

324
00:30:31,694 --> 00:30:33,485
Its God&#39;s will.

325
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:36,110
Is it God&#39;s will that everyone calls me wretch.

326
00:30:36,527 --> 00:30:38,819
Treat me the way they want.

327
00:30:39,777 --> 00:30:40,902
What do they think?

328
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:46,069
Just because this happened to me, it&#39;s pretty easy for them.

329
00:30:46,527 --> 00:30:50,069
They think they can say anything they like.

330
00:30:50,735 --> 00:30:54,360
Why couldn&#39;t anyone muster this courage before, sister? Why not?

331
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,485
Why not?

332
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:02,194
What happened? Meeru?

333
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,610
Are you happy now?

334
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,319
She slapped you.

335
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,902
Are you satisfied now?

336
00:31:15,194 --> 00:31:16,569
Or maybe you can try again.

337
00:31:16,819 --> 00:31:18,859
This time turn the other cheek.

338
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:23,069
Raje, she didn&#39;t even consider the fact that you loved her since childhood.

339
00:31:23,652 --> 00:31:25,819
Who slaps her lover.

340
00:31:26,527 --> 00:31:31,610
A girl who can slap you in front of the entire neighborhood...

341
00:31:31,902 --> 00:31:35,277
...imagine what she can do behind closed doors.

342
00:31:35,777 --> 00:31:36,985
You are safe.

343
00:31:39,152 --> 00:31:42,277
Raje. You don&#39;t understand, son.

344
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:44,194
You&#39;ve been rejected.

345
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,735
She doesn&#39;t love you ....

346
00:31:45,819 --> 00:31:47,819
Her slap means no.

347
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,069
No!

348
00:31:49,819 --> 00:31:52,527
For God&#39;s sake. Please listen to me.

349
00:31:53,027 --> 00:31:56,819
Only a few people saw it now, tomorrow the entire city will witness.

350
00:31:57,985 --> 00:31:59,819
You should save what little reputation you have left.

351
00:32:00,569 --> 00:32:03,360
In fact, you should never see her again.

352
00:32:04,069 --> 00:32:05,777
Understand.

353
00:32:06,569 --> 00:32:07,819
Stupid Romeo.

354
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,694
Forgive me, mother.

355
00:32:55,485 --> 00:32:57,152
I made a big mistake.

356
00:32:58,569 --> 00:33:00,360
I don&#39;t want to get married.

357
00:33:01,735 --> 00:33:03,319
I don&#39;t even want to hear the word again.

358
00:33:05,027 --> 00:33:07,360
Just get sister married.

359
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,277
It&#39;s all right, son.

360
00:33:10,777 --> 00:33:12,152
Go and sleep.

361
00:33:12,235 --> 00:33:13,444
It&#39;s quite late.

362
00:33:13,527 --> 00:33:14,777
Go on, son.

363
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,194
"That one slap answered all my questions."

364
00:34:03,069 --> 00:34:05,194
"I will never bother you again."

365
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:07,859
"In fact, I will never even show you my face."

366
00:34:08,652 --> 00:34:10,319
"This is my last gift."

367
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:14,819
"You can wear it if you like or break them."

368
00:34:15,652 --> 00:34:20,485
"It&#39;s said that only a few blessed hearts find love."

369
00:34:20,944 --> 00:34:22,610
"Love is like the miracle"

370
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:24,777
"...and miracles doesn&#39;t happen with everyone ...

371
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:30,569
Yes, what&#39;s the matter?

372
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:32,152
Polio drops for the children.

373
00:34:32,235 --> 00:34:34,777
I won&#39;t give polio drops to my children.

374
00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:37,110
Why? - Because it gives them loose motions.

375
00:34:37,194 --> 00:34:40,819
And who&#39;s going to bear the expenses? Go to the hospital every day?

376
00:34:40,902 --> 00:34:42,277
These drops are worth 800, aren&#39;t they?

377
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,485
Then why don&#39;t you give me ration worth 800 instead?

378
00:34:44,569 --> 00:34:48,277
I will get the ration, but never give these drops to my children.

379
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,110
But we can give these drops to the entire neighborhood for 800.

380
00:34:50,194 --> 00:34:51,485
Then go give it to the neighbors.

381
00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:53,569
Give it to Nawaz Shariff. Give it to Zardari.

382
00:34:53,694 --> 00:34:54,527
And Shahbaz Shariff as well.

383
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:58,152
In fact, call Altaf Hussain back from London and give him these drops too.

384
00:34:58,235 --> 00:35:00,819
But I won&#39;t give these drops to my children.

385
00:35:00,902 --> 00:35:01,819
Never!

386
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,819
Never!

387
00:35:02,944 --> 00:35:04,319
Come inside.

388
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:06,819
But...

389
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:12,610
Let&#39;s go.

390
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:14,027
Stupid woman.

391
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:19,360
She isn&#39;t worried about her children at all.

392
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:25,194
We work so hard to give these polio drops but we have no respect.

393
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:39,777
Give me 6 eggs.

394
00:35:40,235 --> 00:35:42,402
Brother, give single-line notebook.

395
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:47,402
Hold this.

396
00:35:47,485 --> 00:35:49,610
Oh no, Curse you boy.

397
00:35:49,735 --> 00:35:51,027
Where is this Raja?

398
00:35:56,027 --> 00:35:58,360
We&#39;ve covered all the homes in Kartal... - You always look worried.

399
00:35:58,444 --> 00:36:00,819
You should enjoy life.

400
00:36:03,069 --> 00:36:04,444
What happened?

401
00:36:04,694 --> 00:36:06,152
Listen.

402
00:36:06,235 --> 00:36:07,777
Listen.

403
00:36:08,819 --> 00:36:09,902
Raje!

404
00:36:11,527 --> 00:36:14,027
Love will kill him someday.

405
00:36:14,152 --> 00:36:16,985
This crazy guy always following us.

406
00:36:18,194 --> 00:36:20,569
You&#39;re in love and I&#39;ve to risk my life.

407
00:36:25,985 --> 00:36:29,194
Who goes for a swim in the river in this cold weather?

408
00:36:29,277 --> 00:36:30,527
US!

409
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:32,444
We didn&#39;t go for a swim, aunty.

410
00:36:32,527 --> 00:36:34,819
We saw witch at the bridge...

411
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:37,152
We jumped in to save our lives.

412
00:36:37,235 --> 00:36:40,319
I&#39;ve told you before not to go to the river in the evening.

413
00:36:40,402 --> 00:36:41,069
Yes, mother.

414
00:36:41,152 --> 00:36:44,235
Witches come after handsome boys. - Yes.

415
00:36:49,194 --> 00:36:52,402
Aunty, don&#39;t blow so hard. It&#39;s already cold.

416
00:36:52,985 --> 00:36:55,402
Should I get soup&#39;s photocopy?

417
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,235
Such beautiful bangles Meeru.

418
00:37:47,735 --> 00:37:49,027
Why don&#39;t you wear them?

419
00:38:07,277 --> 00:38:08,944
Are you playing a prank on me?

420
00:38:10,027 --> 00:38:12,027
Why would I play a prank on you?

421
00:38:12,694 --> 00:38:14,027
What&#39;s in it, Raja?

422
00:38:16,985 --> 00:38:19,610
Careful, or it might explode.

423
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:43,110
"You don&#39;t have to hide. It was my fault"

424
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,819
"I am sending a gift for you."

425
00:38:46,402 --> 00:38:50,194
"It can be the first one, or the last."

426
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:51,239
Don&#39;t try to look smart.

427
00:42:52,614 --> 00:42:54,155
We have a reputation.

428
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:01,614
Will you marry her?

429
00:43:03,489 --> 00:43:06,614
Then send your family over, to discuss this proposal.

430
00:43:07,864 --> 00:43:09,364
Then you two can roam around wherever you want.

431
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:12,114
Respectfully.

432
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,280
Let it be.

433
00:43:16,155 --> 00:43:17,530
We&#39;ll offer him tea...

434
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,697
...when he brings a proper wedding proposal.

435
00:43:24,905 --> 00:43:26,489
Here you go. Bravo.

436
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,864
Uncle, please come with me.

437
00:43:31,364 --> 00:43:33,739
The family takes the wedding proposal.

438
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:36,114
You&#39;re my family as well.

439
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,364
Idiot, a family isn&#39;t complete without a woman.

440
00:43:39,947 --> 00:43:41,530
No one even let me rent a place.

441
00:43:41,655 --> 00:43:43,030
Who do you think will accept a proposal from me.

442
00:43:43,697 --> 00:43:46,655
Wedding proposals sound better when it comes from the family.

443
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:48,239
My family will never go.

444
00:43:48,864 --> 00:43:50,739
Why not? She&#39;s your mother after all.

445
00:43:51,614 --> 00:43:55,697
I already told mom that I don&#39;t want to get married.

446
00:43:57,947 --> 00:43:59,030
Great.

447
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:00,697
You know I have a theory about you.

448
00:44:00,864 --> 00:44:02,322
You have no conscience.

449
00:44:02,614 --> 00:44:03,864
You have no courage....

450
00:44:04,322 --> 00:44:05,864
You always go back on your word.

451
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:10,072
I guess you&#39;ll never get married...

452
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:12,072
Uncle, it just happened.

453
00:44:12,155 --> 00:44:13,864
I said it because I was very emotional.

454
00:44:13,947 --> 00:44:15,780
I thought I will never get married.

455
00:44:16,322 --> 00:44:17,864
And now you think you will.

456
00:44:19,697 --> 00:44:21,239
Now I feel that for sure.

457
00:44:22,614 --> 00:44:24,114
I must commend your courage.

458
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,864
Then go talk to your mother.

459
00:44:26,322 --> 00:44:28,030
And take her with you.

460
00:44:36,489 --> 00:44:37,864
You&#39;re back, son.

461
00:44:37,947 --> 00:44:40,364
Bless you, son.

462
00:44:40,697 --> 00:44:42,114
Why do you look tired today?

463
00:44:42,322 --> 00:44:43,489
Sit down.

464
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:48,989
I&#39;ll rub some oil on your head. You&#39;ll feel refreshed.

465
00:44:54,864 --> 00:44:57,072
Raje, did you eat your food?

466
00:44:57,405 --> 00:44:58,322
No.

467
00:44:58,405 --> 00:45:00,614
I&#39;ll reheat it for you.

468
00:45:04,697 --> 00:45:07,614
This is a good chance. I&#39;ll talk to her.

469
00:45:09,197 --> 00:45:10,822
Sit here.

470
00:45:14,364 --> 00:45:17,155
Mother, there&#39;s something I want to say.

471
00:45:17,947 --> 00:45:19,197
I know.

472
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:20,447
Know what?

473
00:45:20,905 --> 00:45:23,030
You want to get married, don&#39;t you?

474
00:45:23,905 --> 00:45:26,530
&#39;Mothers are really the incarnation of God.&#39;

475
00:45:26,614 --> 00:45:28,197
&#39;She can read your mind.&#39;

476
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,780
A mother&#39;s heart is very delicate.

477
00:45:31,072 --> 00:45:32,864
And it melt&#39;s seeing her children&#39;s tears.

478
00:45:33,155 --> 00:45:36,864
And son no mother wants to see her children unhappy.

479
00:45:37,114 --> 00:45:40,114
Soon we&#39;ll hear the good news.

480
00:45:40,197 --> 00:45:42,989
Your sister has received a proposal.

481
00:45:43,489 --> 00:45:44,655
Look.

482
00:45:45,947 --> 00:45:47,530
Take a look.

483
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:50,279
Looks like a nice guy. - Isn&#39;t he?

484
00:45:50,364 --> 00:45:53,114
What does he do? - He&#39;s a government official.

485
00:45:53,489 --> 00:45:55,655
Then he&#39;ll ask for big dowry as well. - No.

486
00:45:55,739 --> 00:45:58,239
He isn&#39;t asking for dowry. - That&#39;s great.

487
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:01,697
What&#39;s better is that he has a sister.

488
00:46:02,114 --> 00:46:03,155
See.

489
00:46:04,072 --> 00:46:04,864
See.

490
00:46:06,072 --> 00:46:07,864
So? - So what?

491
00:46:08,322 --> 00:46:11,239
Swapping! Neither we&#39;ll have to give any dowry, nor will they.

492
00:46:11,405 --> 00:46:12,739
Mother, I am your son...

493
00:46:12,822 --> 00:46:15,655
...and not some object which you will give as dowry at your daughter&#39;s wedding.

494
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,239
Then why didn&#39;t you save up for my dowry?

495
00:46:18,447 --> 00:46:19,489
What&#39;s wrong with her?

496
00:46:19,614 --> 00:46:22,864
Such a beautiful girl. Big eyes, long nose.

497
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,822
You don&#39;t have a reason to say no.

498
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:27,197
Why won&#39;t you marry her? Why won&#39;t you marry her?

499
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,405
You said it yourself that you want to get married.

500
00:46:30,489 --> 00:46:32,905
So why are you refusing this nice proposal?

501
00:46:33,155 --> 00:46:36,030
It&#39;s my desire to see you both married.

502
00:46:36,114 --> 00:46:38,030
And God has created such a good opportunity.

503
00:46:38,114 --> 00:46:40,864
When one daughter leaves, I&#39;ll bring another one home.

504
00:46:40,947 --> 00:46:43,780
Both of you will get married in the same tent.

505
00:46:43,864 --> 00:46:45,364
Say yes, son.

506
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:47,197
Say yes.

507
00:46:47,447 --> 00:46:49,447
Say yes. - Mother...

508
00:46:50,864 --> 00:46:53,947
Mother, I want a love-marriage.

509
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:55,655
You want to do what?

510
00:46:56,572 --> 00:46:57,697
Love-marriage.

511
00:46:58,197 --> 00:46:59,864
Curse you.

512
00:47:00,739 --> 00:47:01,822
Your sister is still unmarried.

513
00:47:01,864 --> 00:47:03,072
And mother is widow .....

514
00:47:03,155 --> 00:47:05,030
Aren&#39;t you ashamed of saying such a thing?

515
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:06,947
She&#39;s my childhood love, mother.

516
00:47:07,155 --> 00:47:09,989
Oh, my, mother. Listen to this shameless.

517
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:13,447
We thought he was going to work. But he was chasing girls instead.

518
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:15,364
If only your father was still alive...

519
00:47:15,447 --> 00:47:18,280
...he would&#39;ve beaten this love out of you.

520
00:47:18,364 --> 00:47:19,530
Romeo.

521
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:24,697
Mother, ask this Macho Man, whom he wants to marry.

522
00:47:25,655 --> 00:47:26,822
Tell me.

523
00:47:26,864 --> 00:47:28,697
With Meeru. - Meeru who?

524
00:47:28,905 --> 00:47:31,197
She lives near that uncle Nabeel&#39;s home.

525
00:47:31,989 --> 00:47:33,072
That Meeru.

526
00:47:33,155 --> 00:47:35,530
The one who became a widow on the day of her wedding.

527
00:47:35,822 --> 00:47:38,989
Oh my, God.

528
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,114
That Meeru.

529
00:47:42,489 --> 00:47:45,697
That witch has cast a spell on my son.

530
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,989
He&#39;s lost his mind in love. Forget him.

531
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,364
Let&#39;s talk to her family. And tell them about what she&#39;s doing.

532
00:47:52,447 --> 00:47:55,155
That witch is preying over innocent boys.

533
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:58,405
Listen, don&#39;t we have enough bad luck already...

534
00:47:58,489 --> 00:48:00,155
...that you want to bring her here too.

535
00:48:00,614 --> 00:48:02,072
Listen to me carefully Raja.

536
00:48:02,155 --> 00:48:04,114
You cannot marry that wretch.

537
00:48:04,197 --> 00:48:07,155
I will marry only Meeru and you can do whatever you want.

538
00:48:07,239 --> 00:48:08,822
Then strangle me.

539
00:48:08,864 --> 00:48:11,072
Kill me and marry her at my funeral.

540
00:48:11,155 --> 00:48:12,697
No mother.

541
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,822
Why will you die? Why will you die?

542
00:48:14,864 --> 00:48:17,447
This is all my fault.

543
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:20,614
I will kill myself.

544
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:24,155
I will kill myself. - Baby...what are you doing?

545
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:26,405
Baby. Stop.

546
00:48:26,489 --> 00:48:28,655
I will kill myself.

547
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:32,739
Baby. - Baby is going to die today.

548
00:48:32,822 --> 00:48:35,155
Leave me. I will kill myself today.

549
00:48:35,239 --> 00:48:38,489
Leave me, mother. Leave me.

550
00:48:39,072 --> 00:48:42,739
Look at that shameless. He isn&#39;t trying to save me either.

551
00:48:44,197 --> 00:48:48,030
Leave it, sister. Let it go or someone will get hurt.

552
00:48:48,114 --> 00:48:49,780
Mother will get hurt. - Leave me.

553
00:48:49,864 --> 00:48:53,447
Leave it, sister. - Leave me. Leave me.

554
00:48:58,697 --> 00:49:00,114
Who is here?

555
00:49:01,489 --> 00:49:03,864
Bring the child for Polio drops.

556
00:49:03,947 --> 00:49:06,697
Don&#39;t you know? Marriages are forbidden in our family.

557
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,655
How will we have children? Are you trying to joke with us?

558
00:49:08,739 --> 00:49:10,947
Making fun of us. - Let&#39;s go, she is crazy.

559
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:13,780
Sister, - You called me crazy.

560
00:49:13,864 --> 00:49:15,405
Why are you misbehaving?

561
00:49:16,447 --> 00:49:19,864
Mother...she&#39;s come all the way here.

562
00:49:20,155 --> 00:49:21,864
We didn&#39;t know there are no children in this house.

563
00:49:21,905 --> 00:49:23,405
It&#39;s not our fault that you&#39;re not married.

564
00:49:23,489 --> 00:49:26,155
Yes, it&#39;s all your fault.

565
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:29,822
Let&#39;s go. Let&#39;s go. - Don&#39;t argue with her. She is crazy.

566
00:49:29,947 --> 00:49:33,239
Come here, you wretch. Come here. You witch.

567
00:49:52,655 --> 00:49:56,614
Raje. you haven&#39;t eaten yet.

568
00:50:04,905 --> 00:50:06,322
I don&#39;t want to eat.

569
00:50:07,739 --> 00:50:10,280
Fine. Don&#39;t eat.

570
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:17,989
Even your sister hasn&#39;t eaten anything since morning.

571
00:50:19,114 --> 00:50:21,280
I am worried, Raje.

572
00:50:21,864 --> 00:50:23,947
She might do something in a fit of rage.

573
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:27,155
I&#39;ve hidden all the knives.

574
00:50:28,989 --> 00:50:31,322
And you&#39;re my good son.

575
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:35,197
Can&#39;t you give a small sacrifice?

576
00:50:36,114 --> 00:50:38,780
Raje, think like an elder.

577
00:50:38,947 --> 00:50:42,114
Brothers even give their life for their sister.

578
00:50:42,822 --> 00:50:44,614
But this is not a that serious issue.

579
00:50:45,322 --> 00:50:46,989
And the rest is for you to decide.

580
00:50:57,655 --> 00:51:04,114
&#39;Every Pakistani mother&#39;s last weapon...emotional blackmail.&#39;

581
00:51:05,614 --> 00:51:08,030
Wake up, Raje. Nazir is here.

582
00:51:08,614 --> 00:51:10,155
Raje.

583
00:51:12,155 --> 00:51:13,739
Raje, get up.

584
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:17,447
Open the door, Raje.

585
00:51:19,905 --> 00:51:21,905
Open the door, son.

586
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,780
Raje.

587
00:51:30,864 --> 00:51:32,780
What&#39;s wrong with my son?

588
00:51:32,864 --> 00:51:35,739
Anybody there? - What happened, mother?

589
00:51:35,822 --> 00:51:38,280
What happened, sister? - Something is wrong with Raje.

590
00:51:38,364 --> 00:51:40,864
Where? - Allah...

591
00:51:40,905 --> 00:51:42,864
What happened?

592
00:51:43,155 --> 00:51:45,447
It&#39;s not opening. - What&#39;s wrong with Raje?

593
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:47,864
Move aside. - Raje.

594
00:51:47,905 --> 00:51:48,822
Raje.

595
00:51:48,864 --> 00:51:50,280
Raje.

596
00:51:50,364 --> 00:51:51,447
Raje.

597
00:51:51,864 --> 00:51:53,030
Move aside.

598
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,447
Raje.

599
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,864
What&#39;s wrong with my son?

600
00:51:58,905 --> 00:51:59,739
Raje.

601
00:51:59,822 --> 00:52:01,739
Aunty, he swallowed Phenyl.

602
00:52:01,822 --> 00:52:03,655
Phenyl ... ambulance ....

603
00:52:04,155 --> 00:52:07,572
It&#39;s all right, sister.

604
00:52:07,905 --> 00:52:10,947
Uncle, stay behind me.

605
00:52:16,072 --> 00:52:18,155
Son. Son. Come back.

606
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:20,697
Open your eyes, son. Open your eyes.

607
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,197
I&#39;ll do exactly as you say.

608
00:52:24,655 --> 00:52:27,197
You can marry anyone you want.

609
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,364
But son, open your eyes.

610
00:52:29,447 --> 00:52:31,072
Come back, son.

611
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:33,405
Open your eyes.

612
00:52:34,655 --> 00:52:37,072
Open your eyes.

613
00:52:46,822 --> 00:52:51,780
&#39;Raja fought with death and won his love.&#39;

614
00:53:06,197 --> 00:53:10,030
&#39;Everyone distributes sweets in the hospital on the occasion of a childbirth.&#39;

615
00:53:10,405 --> 00:53:14,239
&#39;But this was the first time for a marriage proposal.&#39;

616
00:53:17,864 --> 00:53:20,405
You too, but you&#39;re sister ...

617
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:23,029
&#39;Raja was going to become a husband.&#39;

618
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:28,114
&#39;But sister missed out on the chance o becoming a bride again.

619
00:53:28,822 --> 00:53:31,780
&#39;Oh my, poor sister Baby.&#39;

620
00:53:43,364 --> 00:53:44,989
Look happy.

621
00:53:45,364 --> 00:53:46,530
It&#39;s your brother&#39;s wedding.

622
00:53:46,655 --> 00:53:49,197
It&#39;s Raja&#39;s wedding.

623
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,697
Food is served. - Come on.

624
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:54,614
Come on.

625
00:53:55,114 --> 00:53:57,947
Come, Baby, let&#39;s eat.

626
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:00,447
I am not eating this food.

627
00:54:00,947 --> 00:54:02,864
I&#39;ll go get some food for you.

628
00:54:10,405 --> 00:54:11,822
It&#39;s all right.

629
00:54:11,864 --> 00:54:14,697
Sometimes the youngest get married first.

630
00:54:15,197 --> 00:54:16,989
Eventually, you&#39;ll get married too.

631
00:54:17,072 --> 00:54:19,864
Decent girls always get married late, Rashida.

632
00:54:19,905 --> 00:54:22,447
I am not preying on the innocent guys. Like others

633
00:54:22,614 --> 00:54:25,197
Enough, stop talking nonsense.

634
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,447
Why don&#39;t you listen to her? - Eat some food.

635
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:29,197
Forget it, aunty.

636
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,197
I&#39;ll tell you about a pray a routine to follow.

637
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,822
If you do that, she will get married pretty soon.

638
00:54:33,864 --> 00:54:35,614
Don&#39;t pay attention to her.

639
00:54:36,864 --> 00:54:39,989
Come on, dear. Eat it. - The biryani is really tasty.

640
00:54:40,072 --> 00:54:41,864
At least eat a little.

641
00:55:42,828 --> 00:55:43,953
Where&#39;s the money?

642
00:55:45,828 --> 00:55:46,912
What money?

643
00:55:46,995 --> 00:55:49,370
The money we received as a gift. What else?

644
00:55:49,453 --> 00:55:50,578
Where is it?

645
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:14,828
We are going.

646
00:56:15,078 --> 00:56:16,370
Going where?

647
00:56:18,245 --> 00:56:19,620
On our honeymoon.

648
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:24,745
I have a desire to see snow.

649
00:56:24,995 --> 00:56:26,245
Done then.

650
00:56:26,328 --> 00:56:28,287
We&#39;re going to Murree.

651
00:56:28,495 --> 00:56:30,912
Raje, your sister is dying.

652
00:56:31,787 --> 00:56:34,287
She is dying of pain, come quickly.

653
00:56:36,537 --> 00:56:38,245
Keep this money.

654
00:56:41,162 --> 00:56:42,620
What happened?

655
00:56:48,912 --> 00:56:50,453
It&#39;s nothing, just gas.

656
00:56:50,537 --> 00:56:53,328
I think she overate last night at the wedding.

657
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:54,912
You should always eat lightly.

658
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,037
But I didn&#39;t eat anything.

659
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,203
One can get gas on empty stomach as well.

660
00:56:59,287 --> 00:57:00,745
Keep some medicines at home,...

661
00:57:00,828 --> 00:57:02,703
...then you won&#39;t have to come to the hospital.

662
00:57:02,787 --> 00:57:04,662
I&#39;ve prescribed some medicines for now.

663
00:57:12,745 --> 00:57:13,912
Come on.

664
00:57:23,328 --> 00:57:26,037
See you. - Okay, see you.

665
00:57:26,453 --> 00:57:28,745
Okay, I&#39;ll be ready by 10.

666
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,328
Goodbye.

667
00:57:31,078 --> 00:57:34,703
Was everything all right last night? Could you sleep?

668
00:57:35,078 --> 00:57:38,953
I mean it&#39;s hard to sleep in a new place.

669
00:57:39,245 --> 00:57:41,370
Why are you so bothered?

670
00:57:41,412 --> 00:57:45,370
Why don&#39;t you ask her directly? Stop twisting your words.

671
00:57:47,953 --> 00:57:49,370
You ask.

672
00:57:49,412 --> 00:57:50,328
You ask.

673
00:57:50,578 --> 00:57:52,578
Get lost ... hehe

674
00:57:52,662 --> 00:57:53,870
Eat this ... hehe

675
00:57:56,037 --> 00:57:58,703
Sister, why did you leave me alone with them?

676
00:57:58,912 --> 00:58:01,120
They are saying such absurd things.

677
00:58:01,453 --> 00:58:03,328
It happens to everyone.

678
00:58:03,578 --> 00:58:06,745
Listen, was everything okay?

679
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,078
Not you too, sister.

680
00:58:10,537 --> 00:58:11,828
Leave all that.

681
00:58:11,912 --> 00:58:14,953
And please lend me your Kashmiri Shawl.

682
00:58:15,037 --> 00:58:15,953
I need it.

683
00:58:16,037 --> 00:58:17,162
Fine, you can take it.

684
00:58:17,245 --> 00:58:18,578
Are you leaving right now?

685
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:21,870
No. We&#39;re going on a honeymoon.

686
00:58:21,953 --> 00:58:24,078
Murree. I will wear it there.

687
00:58:24,328 --> 00:58:26,870
Wow...honeymoon.

688
00:58:27,245 --> 00:58:29,370
Did you tell aunty Nasreen? I&#39;ll tell her.

689
00:58:29,412 --> 00:58:31,953
Aunty Nasreen. - No, sister.

690
00:58:35,828 --> 00:58:38,412
(Singing song) ...

691
00:58:46,662 --> 00:58:50,037
Mother, I am going to bring meeru back.

692
00:58:50,412 --> 00:58:51,870
Where&#39;s the money?

693
00:58:52,828 --> 00:58:54,662
It was only a couple of thousand rupees.

694
00:58:54,745 --> 00:58:56,245
I&#39;ve kept it safely.

695
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,495
Your garland was worth 3000.

696
00:58:58,578 --> 00:59:00,203
Meaning you only got 2000 as a gift.

697
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:02,037
Meeru got more.

698
00:59:02,537 --> 00:59:05,203
So, you didn&#39;t take that from her? - Those belong to her.

699
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:08,037
And, we&#39;re using her money go for our honeymoon.

700
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,828
Who&#39;s going to look after the shop?

701
00:59:10,037 --> 00:59:12,662
We&#39;re going to Murree.

702
00:59:12,745 --> 00:59:15,370
Meeru wants to see snowfall.

703
00:59:15,787 --> 00:59:18,412
So now you&#39;re busy fulfilled her dreams.

704
00:59:18,495 --> 00:59:19,870
This is what I feared.

705
00:59:19,953 --> 00:59:22,245
Now you will never save up for your sister&#39;s dowry...

706
00:59:22,328 --> 00:59:24,162
...nor will she ever get married.

707
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:27,203
First, it was your marriage, now it&#39;s your honeymoon.

708
00:59:27,287 --> 00:59:28,412
Soon you will have children.

709
00:59:28,495 --> 00:59:30,203
And that poor girl will look after you kids.

710
00:59:30,287 --> 00:59:32,370
My child will spend the rest of her life at home.

711
00:59:32,412 --> 00:59:35,287
Mother, why are you saying such bitter things?

712
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:37,037
I am there. I will handle everything.

713
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,495
I am even going to get money from the Committee.

714
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,370
Get lost. - All our problems will be solved.

715
00:59:40,453 --> 00:59:44,245
Then I will do as my mother says. - Raja, get lost.

716
00:59:45,412 --> 00:59:47,203
Can I go? - Get lost.

717
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:51,495
Crazy.

718
01:00:01,745 --> 01:00:03,370
Ice-cream in this cold weather?

719
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:05,328
It will be cold in Murree as well.

720
01:00:05,412 --> 01:00:06,787
We&#39;ll have ice-cream there as well.

721
01:00:07,328 --> 01:00:09,703
We&#39;ll eat ice-cream in Murree as well. - Yes.

722
01:00:09,953 --> 01:00:12,620
On Mall Road. In the cold. While it&#39;s snowing.

723
01:00:12,703 --> 01:00:13,953
It will be great fun.

724
01:00:14,037 --> 01:00:15,245
They also have a chairlift, don&#39;t they?

725
01:00:15,328 --> 01:00:18,203
"Please buy one flower, don&#39;t break my heart."

726
01:00:18,287 --> 01:00:19,953
Done! - Excuse me..

727
01:00:20,453 --> 01:00:22,453
"Please buy one flower, don&#39;t break my heart.

728
01:00:22,537 --> 01:00:23,703
How much?

729
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:26,370
There&#39;s no price of love. You can give anything you want.

730
01:00:26,453 --> 01:00:27,870
What a smart kid.

731
01:00:28,203 --> 01:00:29,037
Wait.

732
01:00:30,745 --> 01:00:31,662
Take this.

733
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:34,703
Are you going to give it just like that?

734
01:00:35,912 --> 01:00:38,120
Then? - Let me show you.

735
01:00:44,162 --> 01:00:45,787
Get lost.

736
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:00,662
Allow me. - No, I&#39;ll take it.

737
01:01:00,745 --> 01:01:01,953
It&#39;s heavy.

738
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:08,412
Mother, here&#39;s the money. - We&#39;re getting late.

739
01:01:08,495 --> 01:01:09,995
Coming, hold your horses.

740
01:01:10,078 --> 01:01:11,495
Kebabs for the journey.

741
01:01:11,953 --> 01:01:12,912
Okay.

742
01:01:15,745 --> 01:01:17,870
Nazir, keep this with the other stuff.

743
01:01:18,912 --> 01:01:21,370
What is this? - My bag, what else.

744
01:01:21,453 --> 01:01:23,787
I am coming along as well. I want to see Murree as well.

745
01:01:23,995 --> 01:01:25,787
Mother, didn&#39;t you tell them?

746
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:28,870
Mother... - Take her along, Raje.

747
01:01:28,953 --> 01:01:30,745
You&#39;re going far away from home for the first time.

748
01:01:30,828 --> 01:01:32,703
You must have someone older with you.

749
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:34,620
Then why don&#39;t you go too, aunty?

750
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:37,745
With two elders from the family, their honeymoon will be a success.

751
01:01:37,953 --> 01:01:40,328
Isn&#39;t it, Raje. - Baby, take this.

752
01:01:40,703 --> 01:01:42,120
Keep this money with you.

753
01:01:42,203 --> 01:01:44,578
Your brother&#39;s going with you, so no need to worry.

754
01:01:44,662 --> 01:01:47,162
But still, you should have some money with you.

755
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:48,370
Get something to eat.

756
01:01:48,578 --> 01:01:50,662
Goodbye, mother.

757
01:01:51,078 --> 01:01:53,703
My child, take care of yourself.

758
01:01:54,412 --> 01:01:56,245
Let me see you out.

759
01:02:04,745 --> 01:02:05,953
Let&#39;s go.

760
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,453
What are you looking at?

761
01:03:05,162 --> 01:03:06,787
I can&#39;t believe my eyes.

762
01:03:08,537 --> 01:03:10,120
Then why don&#39;t you touch me and make sure?

763
01:03:38,953 --> 01:03:40,828
Raje. - Who is it?

764
01:03:40,912 --> 01:03:42,412
Raje, open the door.

765
01:03:44,037 --> 01:03:45,745
Hurry up.

766
01:03:51,662 --> 01:03:53,328
What happened, sister? - Move aside.

767
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:56,453
I am very scared. I can hear such weird noises.

768
01:03:57,037 --> 01:03:58,287
I am not sleeping there.

769
01:03:58,370 --> 01:04:01,245
I am sleeping right here, with you two.

770
01:04:03,203 --> 01:04:08,037
&#39;This is called near, but still far.&#39;

771
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:13,162
&#39;Sorry, I forgot. We have a family audience.&#39;

772
01:04:13,953 --> 01:04:18,328
&#39;Instead of romantic tunes, we could hear snoring.&#39;

773
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:21,537
&#39;Sister wasn&#39;t scared anymore.&#39;

774
01:04:23,037 --> 01:04:28,870
&#39;But Raja was scared now. What else is going to happen next.&#39;

775
01:04:31,912 --> 01:04:35,912
&#39;Baji took advantage of being the older.&#39;

776
01:04:36,495 --> 01:04:41,537
&#39;He never let those two out of her sight.&#39;

777
01:05:02,078 --> 01:05:09,203
Murree people should have boycot Baji, its not my feelings but horse.

778
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:24,787
&#39;Raja knew it was going to be cold.&#39;

779
01:05:25,578 --> 01:05:29,912
&#39;But Raja didn&#39;t expect it to be so cold.&#39;

780
01:05:31,912 --> 01:05:32,912
It&#39;s so cold, isn&#39;t it?

781
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:35,495
Yes, its cold, but you doesn&#39;t care ...

782
01:05:43,537 --> 01:05:47,870
A man looks for a ray of hope when he&#39;s disappointed.

783
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:52,203
But Raja was waiting for it to be dark.

784
01:05:58,162 --> 01:05:59,870
What&#39;s so funny?

785
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:07,495
People have made a hype out of Murree.

786
01:06:07,578 --> 01:06:08,953
There was nothing to see.

787
01:06:09,037 --> 01:06:10,620
Similar looking mountains all around.

788
01:06:10,703 --> 01:06:13,203
It was a big mistake going there. I got bored.

789
01:06:13,287 --> 01:06:15,370
Why didn&#39;t you call? I would&#39;ve come and picked you up.

790
01:06:15,412 --> 01:06:17,287
How could you have come there, uncle?

791
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:19,620
It&#39;s a long way up.

792
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:23,037
Mother, I puked one while going.

793
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,578
And twice on my way back.

794
01:06:24,828 --> 01:06:27,245
I didn&#39;t have any fun. - Shut up.

795
01:06:27,703 --> 01:06:29,453
Did you guys have fun?

796
01:06:29,787 --> 01:06:30,912
Mother, we...

797
01:06:30,995 --> 01:06:32,537
I am your friend Aashiq Rafaqat. - Quiet.

798
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:35,620
And I am coming to your land of Punjab.

799
01:06:35,703 --> 01:06:38,495
And I&#39;m going to play with you.

800
01:06:38,787 --> 01:06:41,037
So my brothers and sisters pick up your phone...

801
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,162
...and dial the number.

802
01:06:42,245 --> 01:06:43,745
Go for it!

803
01:06:44,703 --> 01:06:48,287
Text now to Win, send Your name Identification card no.

804
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:50,078
And send it to 8787.

805
01:06:50,162 --> 01:06:52,745
Win all you want. - Mother, eat first, wash your hands ....

806
01:06:52,828 --> 01:06:54,828
......until they don&#39;t invite me to the show.

807
01:06:54,912 --> 01:06:56,037
Just watch.

808
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,995
If I get on the show, I am going to go on a rampage.

809
01:06:59,078 --> 01:07:01,412
No one can do it like sister can.

810
01:07:01,495 --> 01:07:02,953
What?

811
01:07:03,453 --> 01:07:06,245
No one can play like you, sister. - Yes.

812
01:07:06,328 --> 01:07:07,495
That&#39;s true.

813
01:07:25,912 --> 01:07:27,745
This time my name&#39;s going to come up.

814
01:07:27,953 --> 01:07:30,370
But doctor said, you are going to die before ....

815
01:07:36,662 --> 01:07:37,453
This one.

816
01:07:40,037 --> 01:07:41,412
Oh no...

817
01:07:44,453 --> 01:07:46,703
Yellow box. No. 2.

818
01:07:49,245 --> 01:07:51,203
I want the promotion in Punjab style.

819
01:07:51,287 --> 01:07:52,370
Big. Make it big.

820
01:07:52,412 --> 01:07:54,162
Branding. Brand things with my name.

821
01:07:54,245 --> 01:07:57,495
Chips in my name, even drawstrings.

822
01:07:57,703 --> 01:07:59,578
Chew and win. Okay.

823
01:07:59,662 --> 01:08:01,702
Go for it. How is it? How is it?

824
01:08:01,787 --> 01:08:02,578
How is it?

825
01:08:05,703 --> 01:08:06,703
No. 4.

826
01:08:23,912 --> 01:08:27,787
Here comes your host Aashiq Raffaqat.

827
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:30,620
Punjab has made me really happy.

828
01:08:30,703 --> 01:08:34,495
2 million SMS in 24 hours.

829
01:08:35,245 --> 01:08:37,162
So hold your hearts.

830
01:08:37,245 --> 01:08:40,995
Because I am going to disclose the names of those four lucky people...

831
01:08:41,412 --> 01:08:46,412
...who will play with us this week from Punjab "Jeet Ke Lelo".

832
01:08:48,078 --> 01:08:49,995
So the first lucky person...

833
01:08:50,162 --> 01:08:55,078
who is going to play with us is from Multan and his name Sohan Halwa.

834
01:08:59,078 --> 01:09:01,620
I mean Imran Bajwa sir.

835
01:09:01,828 --> 01:09:04,370
He&#39;ll bring Sohan Halwa when he comes here.

836
01:09:04,578 --> 01:09:08,245
Congratulation Imran Bajwa sir, you will be playing with us.

837
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,370
Now for the second lucky person.

838
01:09:12,953 --> 01:09:17,162
Wow, he&#39;s from the city of Narali. What a unique name.

839
01:09:17,245 --> 01:09:19,120
Must be unique like the city of Narali.

840
01:09:19,203 --> 01:09:19,953
Mother.

841
01:09:20,037 --> 01:09:22,245
Raja, come quickly.

842
01:09:22,328 --> 01:09:24,662
My name&#39;s coming up. - And she is a lady.

843
01:09:24,745 --> 01:09:26,912
And my sister&#39;s name is.

844
01:09:26,995 --> 01:09:27,912
Shall I say it?

845
01:09:28,328 --> 01:09:29,245
Shall I say it?

846
01:09:31,245 --> 01:09:32,412
Forget it, let&#39;s disclose it after the break.

847
01:09:32,495 --> 01:09:34,120
Shall we take a break? Or should I say it?

848
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:35,828
Sure?

849
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:37,828
Or should I say it?

850
01:09:37,912 --> 01:09:39,662
Then say so. Say it.

851
01:09:39,745 --> 01:09:41,412
Say it!

852
01:09:41,495 --> 01:09:46,078
So my sister&#39;s name is Meerub Khurram.

853
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:51,412
Yes, Meerub Khurram...

854
01:09:51,495 --> 01:09:53,453
...will play with us in Punjab.(Tv Voice) - But I only messaged them once.

855
01:09:53,578 --> 01:09:58,745
How could my name be selected? - So let&#39;s find out the next lucky person...

856
01:09:59,037 --> 01:10:03,203
"But I only messaged them once. How could my name be selected?"

857
01:10:03,537 --> 01:10:05,162
Witch. Wretch.

858
01:10:05,328 --> 01:10:08,120
Why did you message?

859
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:12,703
My thumbs went soar from messaging them constantly.

860
01:10:12,787 --> 01:10:15,453
But her name got selected in a single message.

861
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:17,078
Are you so lucky?

862
01:10:17,412 --> 01:10:19,537
She did it intentionally.

863
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:21,620
She knew I want to go to that show.

864
01:10:21,703 --> 01:10:23,412
Why are you doing this?

865
01:10:23,495 --> 01:10:24,995
Why are you so revengeful?

866
01:10:25,078 --> 01:10:27,120
You don&#39;t want me to be happy.

867
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:32,037
She got my wedding canceled.

868
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:34,578
And now I couldn&#39;t get on the show either.

869
01:10:34,662 --> 01:10:36,203
I will not spare her.

870
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:39,245
Sister... - You scoundrel.

871
01:10:39,328 --> 01:10:41,495
I will kill you ...

872
01:10:41,578 --> 01:10:43,995
None of you want me to be happy

873
01:10:44,578 --> 01:10:47,037
Why didn&#39;t my name came on lucky draw ....

874
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,912
Why didn&#39;t my name came on lucky draw ....

875
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:53,036
Why didn&#39;t my name came on lucky draw ....

876
01:11:22,829 --> 01:11:24,163
Sister Baby.

877
01:11:25,038 --> 01:11:27,413
Why don&#39;t you go instead of me?

878
01:11:27,829 --> 01:11:31,038
I was just trying my luck.

879
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:33,579
I don&#39;t want to go.

880
01:11:35,329 --> 01:11:36,663
Why couldn&#39;t you say that before?

881
01:11:36,871 --> 01:11:38,496
You made me break the TV.

882
01:11:39,913 --> 01:11:41,704
Don&#39;t worry, mother.

883
01:11:43,413 --> 01:11:45,079
I&#39;ll win a new one this time.

884
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:55,288
Mother.

885
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:57,746
Mother. - Yes.

886
01:11:58,204 --> 01:11:59,954
Help me tie this knot.

887
01:12:00,329 --> 01:12:02,288
I wonder where uncle is?

888
01:12:02,579 --> 01:12:03,788
It&#39;s getting late.

889
01:12:05,329 --> 01:12:06,746
Uncle. - Coming, dear.

890
01:12:06,829 --> 01:12:07,954
Where were you?

891
01:12:08,038 --> 01:12:09,913
We must go early and grab good seats.

892
01:12:09,996 --> 01:12:12,079
Look what I made. See.

893
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:16,204
Oh, my, uncle. Now, this is more like it.

894
01:12:16,413 --> 01:12:17,371
You know, mother.

895
01:12:17,413 --> 01:12:21,413
If you take a stupid gift to the show, you have better chances of winning.

896
01:12:22,288 --> 01:12:25,079
Mother. I am going on the bus.

897
01:12:25,746 --> 01:12:27,579
But I will return in my own car.

898
01:12:27,663 --> 01:12:28,996
So be it.

899
01:12:29,454 --> 01:12:31,329
Shall we go, uncle? - Yes, let&#39;s go.

900
01:12:31,371 --> 01:12:32,413
Come on.

901
01:12:34,538 --> 01:12:36,246
See you. - Goodbye.

902
01:12:37,704 --> 01:12:40,954
Let&#39;s go, son.

903
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:56,996
I was telling you, we&#39;ll be late.

904
01:12:57,079 --> 01:12:58,954
Look at the long queue.

905
01:13:09,079 --> 01:13:11,079
Brother, let me through.

906
01:13:14,788 --> 01:13:15,871
Look at her.

907
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:17,163
Hello.

908
01:13:17,454 --> 01:13:19,371
Madam. Where?

909
01:13:19,704 --> 01:13:20,996
Don&#39;t you see the queue?

910
01:13:21,079 --> 01:13:22,371
I am standing in a queue.

911
01:13:22,496 --> 01:13:23,579
The start at the back.

912
01:13:23,663 --> 01:13:24,621
Do we look crazy to you?

913
01:13:24,704 --> 01:13:26,371
We&#39;ve been standing here for three hours.

914
01:13:26,413 --> 01:13:27,746
Look at her.

915
01:13:28,038 --> 01:13:29,163
Look at her.

916
01:13:29,246 --> 01:13:31,579
Mind your language. I am a special guest.

917
01:13:31,663 --> 01:13:33,246
Brother Aashiq invited me personally.

918
01:13:33,329 --> 01:13:34,371
Don&#39;t try to be over smart.

919
01:13:34,454 --> 01:13:35,496
Get lost.

920
01:13:35,621 --> 01:13:36,996
Everyone is special here.

921
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:39,454
Uncle, take her to the back.

922
01:13:39,621 --> 01:13:41,954
Mister, she is breaking the queue.

923
01:13:42,246 --> 01:13:45,371
No, dear. We&#39;re going. We&#39;re going. - Send her back.

924
01:13:47,038 --> 01:13:49,121
Who does she think she is.

925
01:13:49,204 --> 01:13:50,288
Lady Diana

926
01:13:56,329 --> 01:13:58,413
It&#39;s all your fault, uncle.

927
01:14:06,746 --> 01:14:08,829
Let&#39;s go. Let&#39;s go.

928
01:14:09,038 --> 01:14:10,954
I am from Narali. The winner.

929
01:14:13,163 --> 01:14:14,954
Meerub. - Yes.

930
01:14:15,038 --> 01:14:16,204
ID card.

931
01:14:17,329 --> 01:14:19,079
Huh? - ID card.

932
01:14:28,454 --> 01:14:30,038
But it says Farhana here?

933
01:14:30,788 --> 01:14:33,871
Meerub is my sister-in-law. She sent me here.

934
01:14:33,954 --> 01:14:35,204
I play really well.

935
01:14:35,371 --> 01:14:37,371
This is not a cricket match.

936
01:14:37,454 --> 01:14:38,454
This is a game of fate.

937
01:14:38,579 --> 01:14:40,538
Only the chosen ones can play.

938
01:14:43,788 --> 01:14:45,954
You can talk to Meerub on the phone.

939
01:14:46,038 --> 01:14:47,704
She will tell you that she sent me.

940
01:14:47,788 --> 01:14:49,871
We&#39;re not allowed to talk on the phone.

941
01:14:50,746 --> 01:14:52,038
Just talk to her once.

942
01:14:52,121 --> 01:14:54,329
We cannot allow you even if she says is personally.

943
01:14:54,371 --> 01:14:57,371
Like I said, only the chosen ones will play.

944
01:14:57,454 --> 01:14:59,121
Now please move to the side so that people can come in.

945
01:14:59,204 --> 01:14:59,871
The show is about to begin.

946
01:14:59,954 --> 01:15:02,329
Have you lost your mind? You won&#39;t even talk to her on the phone.

947
01:15:02,371 --> 01:15:03,246
I won&#39;t move.

948
01:15:03,329 --> 01:15:05,246
Sir, please talk to her. - I won&#39;t move. I won&#39;t move.

949
01:15:05,329 --> 01:15:06,204
Please talk to him.

950
01:15:06,288 --> 01:15:08,954
Listen to me. I will listen to what you have to say.

951
01:15:09,038 --> 01:15:11,454
Come here. Why are you troubling other people?

952
01:15:11,579 --> 01:15:14,079
Come on this side. Please.

953
01:15:14,746 --> 01:15:15,621
Come on.

954
01:15:15,704 --> 01:15:17,454
Son, come ahead. Please.

955
01:15:17,704 --> 01:15:18,454
Come on.

956
01:15:18,913 --> 01:15:22,246
I am talking politely, but... - Listen to me.

957
01:15:22,329 --> 01:15:24,079
He was misbehaving with me. - Madam.

958
01:15:24,163 --> 01:15:26,288
You can talk on the phone here.

959
01:15:26,579 --> 01:15:32,246
If you have any problems, any tension, I am at your service.

960
01:15:32,329 --> 01:15:35,954
Until then I&#39;ll get some cold water for you. And get on with this work.

961
01:15:36,038 --> 01:15:38,038
Okay. I&#39;ll be right back.

962
01:15:40,288 --> 01:15:42,328
Come on. Come ahead.

963
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:45,413
Baby, why don&#39;t you talk to him nicely?

964
01:15:45,496 --> 01:15:46,829
Maybe he will listen to you then.

965
01:15:50,371 --> 01:15:51,746
Keep going.

966
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:54,038
Brother, please listen.

967
01:15:54,371 --> 01:15:56,329
What&#39;s in a name?

968
01:15:56,371 --> 01:15:58,704
I am brother Aashiq&#39;s biggest fan.

969
01:15:58,788 --> 01:16:01,371
I watch all his shows. I never missed any of his shows.

970
01:16:01,746 --> 01:16:03,371
Please let me in.

971
01:16:03,746 --> 01:16:05,246
I&#39;ll play really well.

972
01:16:06,788 --> 01:16:10,038
You can keep anything from the prizes I win.

973
01:16:10,121 --> 01:16:11,954
Promise.

974
01:16:13,079 --> 01:16:16,121
I don&#39;t want anything, sister. Please leave.

975
01:16:16,704 --> 01:16:17,996
Try to understand our helplessness.

976
01:16:18,371 --> 01:16:19,079
Please go.

977
01:16:19,163 --> 01:16:20,621
I am talking so politely.

978
01:16:20,746 --> 01:16:23,788
You&#39;ll be doing a good deed. You&#39;ll get my blessings.

979
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:25,579
Spare me, sister!

980
01:16:26,579 --> 01:16:27,788
Leave us alone.

981
01:16:28,163 --> 01:16:29,413
I&#39;ve been trying to explain to you for so long.

982
01:16:29,871 --> 01:16:30,746
Spare you?

983
01:16:32,288 --> 01:16:34,038
Do you think we are beggars?

984
01:16:34,121 --> 01:16:35,454
We traveled so far to get here.

985
01:16:35,579 --> 01:16:37,038
We&#39;ve been standing under the hot so for so long.

986
01:16:37,121 --> 01:16:38,996
I am only asking for my right, my name&#39;s been selected.

987
01:16:39,079 --> 01:16:40,704
I am not asking or a favor.

988
01:16:41,704 --> 01:16:44,704
Curse your show and that idiot Aashiq rafaqat.

989
01:16:44,788 --> 01:16:48,288
I pray that your ratings fall. The show closes down.

990
01:16:48,371 --> 01:16:52,079
And you get jinxed.

991
01:16:52,163 --> 01:16:56,996
You invite poor people here and then humiliate them.

992
01:17:01,038 --> 01:17:01,954
Take this.

993
01:17:03,954 --> 01:17:05,371
No manners at all.

994
01:17:05,413 --> 01:17:07,663
Uncle, tomorrow is the last show.

995
01:17:07,913 --> 01:17:10,829
If you want to send the real contestant over, then do so.

996
01:17:51,371 --> 01:17:54,038
I&#39;ll take you to your sister in the morning.

997
01:17:57,163 --> 01:17:59,163
And bring you back in a day or two.

998
01:18:00,829 --> 01:18:03,204
Until then everything will be alright here as well.

999
01:18:33,621 --> 01:18:34,621
Why did we come here?

1000
01:18:35,163 --> 01:18:35,913
Take this.

1001
01:18:35,996 --> 01:18:37,913
Only 15 minutes for the bus to leave.

1002
01:18:38,329 --> 01:18:41,621
Should I get some snacks for the journey? - Raja, where are we going?

1003
01:18:44,329 --> 01:18:45,829
We&#39;re going to the show.

1004
01:18:47,246 --> 01:18:48,579
Today is the last day.

1005
01:18:48,871 --> 01:18:50,579
And this is your destiny.

1006
01:18:54,413 --> 01:18:56,371
Raje, don&#39;t forget.

1007
01:18:56,663 --> 01:18:59,371
This is a bus stand, control sister-in-law.

1008
01:18:59,704 --> 01:19:01,413
Or someone might make a video.

1009
01:19:02,288 --> 01:19:02,913
Let&#39;s go.

1010
01:19:03,121 --> 01:19:04,579
Let&#39;s go. Let&#39;s go. - Come on.

1011
01:19:08,288 --> 01:19:09,329
That&#39;s our seat.

1012
01:19:13,621 --> 01:19:15,496
Don&#39;t tell anyone. - Yes.

1013
01:19:15,788 --> 01:19:17,579
The TV at our home is already broken.

1014
01:19:17,996 --> 01:19:20,038
We&#39;ll just go to the show and come back.

1015
01:19:20,663 --> 01:19:21,996
Don&#39;t worry.

1016
01:19:22,371 --> 01:19:24,871
This is a graveyard.

1017
01:19:25,496 --> 01:19:27,496
Your secret is buried here.

1018
01:19:29,163 --> 01:19:30,329
Listen.

1019
01:19:31,038 --> 01:19:34,871
Tell brother Aashiq to say "Nazir I love you" on Tv.

1020
01:19:35,329 --> 01:19:36,913
Don&#39;t you forget?

1021
01:19:38,829 --> 01:19:40,913
And at least win a motorcycle.

1022
01:19:40,996 --> 01:19:43,246
See you on TV in the evening.

1023
01:19:43,329 --> 01:19:44,579
Goodbye.

1024
01:19:56,371 --> 01:19:57,829
&#39;If I don&#39;t tell anyone,...

1025
01:19:58,329 --> 01:20:03,121
...then how will people know that Aashiq said "I love you" to me.&#39;

1026
01:20:04,204 --> 01:20:06,704
Don&#39;t forget to watch Aashiq Nafaqat&#39;s show in the evening.

1027
01:20:06,871 --> 01:20:08,371
Raja is coming on the show.

1028
01:20:08,579 --> 01:20:11,038
Okay. - Okay.

1029
01:20:11,413 --> 01:20:12,579
Listen.

1030
01:20:12,746 --> 01:20:15,121
Don&#39;t forget to watch Aashiq Nafaqat&#39;s show in the evening.

1031
01:20:15,288 --> 01:20:19,121
Raja is coming on the show. - We&#39;ll definitely watch it.

1032
01:20:21,121 --> 01:20:24,413
Uncle, don&#39;t forget to watch Aashiq Nafaqat&#39;s show in the evening.

1033
01:20:24,496 --> 01:20:27,079
Raja is coming on the show. - Fine, fine.

1034
01:20:27,746 --> 01:20:29,371
Aju. - Yes, Nazire.

1035
01:20:29,454 --> 01:20:31,829
Close your shop and go home in the evening.

1036
01:20:31,913 --> 01:20:33,121
Raja is coming on the show.

1037
01:20:33,413 --> 01:20:36,621
Anwar. Raja is coming on TV. Don&#39;t forget to watch.

1038
01:20:37,538 --> 01:20:39,788
Greetings, sir. - Greetings.

1039
01:20:39,871 --> 01:20:42,163
Raja is coming on the show. Don&#39;t forget to watch.

1040
01:20:42,246 --> 01:20:44,121
Curses.

1041
01:20:44,204 --> 01:20:47,288
Watching TV is forbidden, Shame on you!

1042
01:20:47,371 --> 01:20:49,788
Where is this generation going...

1043
01:20:49,871 --> 01:20:52,413
You are a son of innocent parents

1044
01:20:52,496 --> 01:20:54,621
Watched tv all day,

1045
01:20:54,704 --> 01:20:56,038
Coming on the show.

1046
01:20:56,121 --> 01:20:58,663
But what time is he coming on the show?

1047
01:21:00,079 --> 01:21:02,829
What time is the program? - What program?

1048
01:21:02,913 --> 01:21:06,371
Raja will come on Aashiq Rafaqat&#39;s show.

1049
01:21:07,454 --> 01:21:10,413
Everyone in Narali knows and you are trying to hide it.

1050
01:21:12,246 --> 01:21:13,621
5 rupees.

1051
01:21:15,746 --> 01:21:16,746
Take it.

1052
01:21:17,163 --> 01:21:18,163
Thank you.

1053
01:21:31,617 --> 01:21:32,867
Brother Aashiq.

1054
01:21:33,742 --> 01:21:37,450
Look... Look there&#39;s Raja. There at the back.

1055
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,700
Liar. Where is he?

1056
01:21:39,742 --> 01:21:41,742
There at the back.

1057
01:21:41,783 --> 01:21:44,617
I saw him myself. He was wearing a black shirt.

1058
01:21:45,158 --> 01:21:48,033
Greetings, Punjab.

1059
01:21:48,117 --> 01:21:49,325
Greetings, Aunty.

1060
01:21:49,408 --> 01:21:52,117
Our Tv has broken down.

1061
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,742
Can we... - It&#39;s all right. It&#39;s all right.

1062
01:21:54,825 --> 01:21:56,367
This is your house too. You can watch here.

1063
01:21:56,575 --> 01:21:58,742
Get up, son. Make a place for sister.

1064
01:21:59,075 --> 01:22:01,075
Greetings, Aunty. - Greetings, dear.

1065
01:22:01,742 --> 01:22:03,492
Sit, sister. Sit down.

1066
01:22:03,783 --> 01:22:04,658
Please sit down.

1067
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:06,075
When did the program start?

1068
01:22:06,325 --> 01:22:07,742
It just started.

1069
01:22:08,367 --> 01:22:10,200
It&#39;s such good news.

1070
01:22:10,658 --> 01:22:12,242
Raja&#39;s on the show.

1071
01:22:12,325 --> 01:22:15,158
Now we&#39;ll see him on Tv. - Yes.

1072
01:22:15,867 --> 01:22:18,450
So tell me, where should I go first?

1073
01:22:18,742 --> 01:22:19,742
Here?

1074
01:22:20,033 --> 01:22:20,950
No-no.

1075
01:22:21,117 --> 01:22:21,908
Here?

1076
01:22:21,992 --> 01:22:22,992
No-no.

1077
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:24,158
Here?

1078
01:22:24,242 --> 01:22:28,200
Where do I go first?

1079
01:22:28,575 --> 01:22:30,158
Wait. First, tell me.

1080
01:22:30,242 --> 01:22:33,200
Who want&#39;s Cherry&#39;s suit?

1081
01:22:33,367 --> 01:22:34,867
So bring it on.

1082
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:39,200
Here you go.

1083
01:22:41,117 --> 01:22:41,992
Here you go.

1084
01:22:42,658 --> 01:22:43,283
Give it.

1085
01:22:43,658 --> 01:22:46,117
Catch it. Catch it.

1086
01:22:47,117 --> 01:22:47,825
Catch it.

1087
01:22:47,908 --> 01:22:48,742
This one&#39;s for you.

1088
01:22:49,367 --> 01:22:50,408
Give it here.

1089
01:22:50,908 --> 01:22:52,950
Take it. Take it.

1090
01:22:54,033 --> 01:22:55,742
Brother Aashiq. Brother Aashiq.

1091
01:22:55,825 --> 01:22:58,783
Look, there&#39;s brother Raja. I saw him first.

1092
01:22:58,867 --> 01:22:59,867
I told you.

1093
01:22:59,950 --> 01:23:02,158
You said he&#39;s wearing a black suit.

1094
01:23:02,242 --> 01:23:04,242
But its green. It was just guesswork.

1095
01:23:04,325 --> 01:23:05,575
I don&#39;t do guesswork.

1096
01:23:05,658 --> 01:23:07,075
Let&#39;s make a bet then.

1097
01:23:07,242 --> 01:23:08,908
Will he win a car or motorcycle?

1098
01:23:08,992 --> 01:23:11,200
Shut up. He won&#39;t win a thing.

1099
01:23:12,117 --> 01:23:15,283
He didn&#39;t take me along so they won&#39;t win a piece of cloth.

1100
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:17,700
Wait. Wait. Wait.

1101
01:23:17,742 --> 01:23:20,325
Who wants a new mobile?

1102
01:23:22,742 --> 01:23:23,742
Bring it here.

1103
01:23:23,867 --> 01:23:25,033
Keep making some noise.

1104
01:23:25,867 --> 01:23:27,158
Yeah!

1105
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:30,700
Bring more.

1106
01:23:30,908 --> 01:23:31,742
This one&#39;s for you.

1107
01:23:32,742 --> 01:23:33,575
This one&#39;s for you.

1108
01:23:33,658 --> 01:23:34,492
Bring more.

1109
01:23:35,658 --> 01:23:36,658
Here you go.

1110
01:23:36,992 --> 01:23:38,033
This one&#39;s for you.

1111
01:23:38,742 --> 01:23:40,117
No... Dance. Dance.

1112
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:40,908
Dance for me first.

1113
01:23:41,908 --> 01:23:42,742
Bring me more mobiles.

1114
01:23:42,783 --> 01:23:44,200
Aunty, this one for you.

1115
01:23:44,367 --> 01:23:45,825
Catch. Catch.

1116
01:23:46,450 --> 01:23:47,825
Take it. Take it.

1117
01:23:49,825 --> 01:23:50,658
See...

1118
01:23:50,742 --> 01:23:52,242
Now say with me. - i told you .....

1119
01:23:52,492 --> 01:23:54,700
Jeet Ke Le Lo.

1120
01:23:56,283 --> 01:23:57,908
So hold your hearts,

1121
01:23:57,992 --> 01:24:01,575
because we&#39;re going to call upon those four lucky people...

1122
01:24:01,658 --> 01:24:04,658
...who will play with us on "Jeet Ke Le Lo".

1123
01:24:05,158 --> 01:24:05,742
Give it.

1124
01:24:05,908 --> 01:24:09,617
And their names are from Multan, Imran Bajwa.

1125
01:24:10,158 --> 01:24:12,575
From Faisalabad, Nargis Javed.

1126
01:24:13,158 --> 01:24:15,325
From Lahore, which is this city.

1127
01:24:15,658 --> 01:24:16,408
Shehzad.

1128
01:24:16,617 --> 01:24:19,575
And from Narali, we have with us, Mira.

1129
01:24:19,742 --> 01:24:21,367
Meerub Khurram.

1130
01:24:27,367 --> 01:24:28,367
Come on.

1131
01:24:32,367 --> 01:24:33,742
Wait. Wait.

1132
01:24:34,242 --> 01:24:36,783
Fate has brought you all here.

1133
01:24:38,075 --> 01:24:40,742
But only your talent will take you forward.

1134
01:24:41,075 --> 01:24:43,992
Because we will play a game with you.

1135
01:24:44,325 --> 01:24:46,783
We&#39;ll play a game with you. Okay. Are you ready?

1136
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:49,992
And whoever wins in that game, the winner of that game.

1137
01:24:50,242 --> 01:24:55,617
Will play with us "Kismat Ki Toh Nikal Padi".

1138
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:57,408
Bravo.

1139
01:24:58,492 --> 01:24:59,742
That&#39;s it.

1140
01:24:59,992 --> 01:25:00,992
Next.

1141
01:25:01,325 --> 01:25:02,783
Come on.

1142
01:25:03,408 --> 01:25:05,367
Harder, mister.

1143
01:25:05,742 --> 01:25:07,033
Faster.

1144
01:25:08,325 --> 01:25:14,742
7...8...9...10!

1145
01:25:14,783 --> 01:25:15,742
Stop.

1146
01:25:16,242 --> 01:25:18,200
That&#39;s it, my brother.

1147
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:21,575
Now focus on what you&#39;ve to do for the rest of your life.

1148
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:22,950
Come. Now let&#39;s count.

1149
01:25:23,033 --> 01:25:24,492
It&#39;s a huge pile of balls.

1150
01:25:24,742 --> 01:25:27,992
1...2...3...

1151
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:31,908
14...15...16!

1152
01:25:32,117 --> 01:25:34,742
Jeet Ke Le Lo!

1153
01:25:34,867 --> 01:25:36,367
Congratulations to you.

1154
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:37,742
So are you ready?

1155
01:25:37,950 --> 01:25:40,117
The boy&#39;s looking so happy.

1156
01:25:40,325 --> 01:25:43,783
So now we&#39;re going to play with you "Kismat Ki Toh Nikal Padi".

1157
01:25:44,408 --> 01:25:46,492
What is your name? - Raja.

1158
01:25:46,617 --> 01:25:48,700
Speak in the mic, brother. What is that for? - Mic.

1159
01:25:48,867 --> 01:25:50,867
Raja. - Oh...Raja.

1160
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:52,783
Then you must be Rani (Queen)!

1161
01:25:53,075 --> 01:25:53,742
What?

1162
01:25:54,117 --> 01:25:56,033
I mean the King&#39;s Queen.

1163
01:25:56,242 --> 01:25:59,367
"The king&#39;s in love with the queen."

1164
01:25:59,742 --> 01:26:03,617
So let&#39;s watch whether you become a real king of your destiny, or not.

1165
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:06,783
So...which box should I open?

1166
01:26:07,367 --> 01:26:09,950
You say. - Don&#39;t open the door to your heart.

1167
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:12,825
Because your queen has already opened that.

1168
01:26:14,825 --> 01:26:15,825
Which number?

1169
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:19,158
16 or 17? - Not 16... 17.

1170
01:26:20,033 --> 01:26:21,102
17

1171
01:26:21,102 --> 01:26:23,450
17 is always dangerous.

1172
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:25,867
Their bad luck has already started.

1173
01:26:25,950 --> 01:26:28,158
They won&#39;t win a thing. - Be quiet.

1174
01:26:28,617 --> 01:26:30,408
But since you insist, I&#39;ll open it anyway.

1175
01:26:30,492 --> 01:26:33,575
Okay. Let&#39;s watch what did you win in no. 17.

1176
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:35,742
Hip-Hip-Hurray!

1177
01:26:36,367 --> 01:26:37,867
Fritters.

1178
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:43,117
I&#39;m going to feed my brother myself.

1179
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,367
Here you go.

1180
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:46,742
And you too, dear. You feed him.

1181
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:47,908
Wow!

1182
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:49,825
You must finish all of it. Finish it.

1183
01:26:51,158 --> 01:26:54,783
Now, who&#39;s going to tell me the next number?

1184
01:26:54,867 --> 01:26:56,033
Will it be you, Raja?

1185
01:26:56,117 --> 01:26:58,575
Or your dear queen?

1186
01:26:59,033 --> 01:27:00,242
He will say it.

1187
01:27:00,658 --> 01:27:03,242
What does the audience say?

1188
01:27:03,408 --> 01:27:04,158
Which number?

1189
01:27:04,408 --> 01:27:06,742
There&#39;s a car in no. 8.

1190
01:27:06,825 --> 01:27:07,992
Number 9.

1191
01:27:09,742 --> 01:27:14,200
Number 9. Let&#39;s see what you won in no. 9.

1192
01:27:15,033 --> 01:27:17,117
No! No! - Number 9.

1193
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,783
Oh no.

1194
01:27:19,075 --> 01:27:21,617
What will they do now?

1195
01:27:21,742 --> 01:27:23,575
This is bad luck.

1196
01:27:24,325 --> 01:27:26,575
Our son was winning.

1197
01:27:27,492 --> 01:27:28,908
Let me call teefa.

1198
01:27:33,908 --> 01:27:34,867
Hello.

1199
01:27:35,367 --> 01:27:37,158
Teefay, your cable is dead again.

1200
01:27:37,242 --> 01:27:38,658
Why don&#39;t you Buy a UPS instead?

1201
01:27:38,742 --> 01:27:41,908
Just a second. I was going to start the generator when you called.

1202
01:27:41,992 --> 01:27:43,492
Okay.

1203
01:27:46,242 --> 01:27:49,325
Javed, why don&#39;t you petrol in it ....?

1204
01:27:51,908 --> 01:27:53,867
When will the electricity come back?

1205
01:27:54,242 --> 01:27:56,158
We&#39;ll be watching these flies all this while?

1206
01:27:56,367 --> 01:27:59,242
We already missed half the game show.

1207
01:28:01,658 --> 01:28:04,158
Baby. Call Nazir.

1208
01:28:04,408 --> 01:28:05,742
He must be watching somewhere.

1209
01:28:07,617 --> 01:28:09,992
And that&#39;s a hattrick of ducks.

1210
01:28:10,075 --> 01:28:11,742
One more.

1211
01:28:11,783 --> 01:28:15,742
Take this. I can&#39;t take this anymore. - Do something.

1212
01:28:15,783 --> 01:28:17,367
Show me how ducks quack?

1213
01:28:17,825 --> 01:28:19,325
How do they quack?

1214
01:28:19,575 --> 01:28:22,117
Quack! Quack! Quack!

1215
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:24,408
Even your duck sounds dead. You can&#39;t do it.

1216
01:28:24,492 --> 01:28:26,283
Uncle did you tell at home that we are watching show?

1217
01:28:26,867 --> 01:28:29,783
Yeah, I have tell everyone !!

1218
01:28:29,867 --> 01:28:32,700
I&#39;ve come so far for the show but I guess I&#39;ll have to take everything back.

1219
01:28:32,742 --> 01:28:33,658
Hello, sister.

1220
01:28:33,867 --> 01:28:37,742
Did they win anything? - Only ducks so far.

1221
01:28:39,242 --> 01:28:40,658
I knew it.

1222
01:28:40,742 --> 01:28:41,950
They won&#39;t win a thing.

1223
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:44,575
Light&#39;s back. Light&#39;s back. - Turn up the volume.

1224
01:28:44,658 --> 01:28:45,950
Hurry up.

1225
01:28:46,033 --> 01:28:47,617
Let me tell you once again.

1226
01:28:47,742 --> 01:28:49,992
Only three more doors left, my friend.

1227
01:28:50,075 --> 01:28:51,617
Only three chances.

1228
01:28:51,783 --> 01:28:54,742
Please win something, brother. Anything.

1229
01:28:54,825 --> 01:28:55,992
You are only collecting ducks.

1230
01:28:56,075 --> 01:28:58,158
Which door should I open now?

1231
01:29:03,867 --> 01:29:04,825
No. 5.

1232
01:29:04,908 --> 01:29:07,117
No. 5. Think about it.

1233
01:29:07,658 --> 01:29:09,867
Please help us out, brother Aashiq.

1234
01:29:10,658 --> 01:29:11,242
Help you.

1235
01:29:11,325 --> 01:29:12,908
Okay. Should I help them?

1236
01:29:13,158 --> 01:29:14,908
I should. Okay.

1237
01:29:15,783 --> 01:29:16,742
Knock. Knock.

1238
01:29:17,033 --> 01:29:18,450
Quack! Quack!

1239
01:29:18,742 --> 01:29:19,867
There are no ducks in it.

1240
01:29:20,325 --> 01:29:22,158
It&#39;s a chicklet.

1241
01:29:25,325 --> 01:29:27,242
Should I open it? - No.

1242
01:29:27,325 --> 01:29:28,075
No. 3.

1243
01:29:28,158 --> 01:29:28,992
No. 3.

1244
01:29:29,075 --> 01:29:31,617
Let&#39;s see what you won in no. 3.

1245
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:32,492

1246
01:29:32,742 --> 01:29:33,658
No. 3.

1247
01:29:33,783 --> 01:29:36,992
1...2...3!

1248
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:39,158
How much do you pay for electricity bill normally?

1249
01:29:39,575 --> 01:29:41,408
Huh? - Your electricity bill?

1250
01:29:41,742 --> 01:29:43,867
Do you pay for it or do you have an illegal connection?

1251
01:29:46,658 --> 01:29:48,325
1500-2000 rupees.

1252
01:29:48,408 --> 01:29:49,658
1500-2000 rupees.

1253
01:29:49,742 --> 01:29:52,617
Then be ready, because now it&#39;s going to be 15000.

1254
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:55,575
Because you just won an LCD, Washing machine,

1255
01:29:55,658 --> 01:29:59,450
refrigerator, microwave and a generator.

1256
01:29:59,992 --> 01:30:01,742
He won!

1257
01:30:01,783 --> 01:30:03,075
Wasn&#39;t that nice?

1258
01:30:03,158 --> 01:30:04,867
Thank God.

1259
01:30:04,950 --> 01:30:09,408
You were being worried, that your tv is broken, you just won LCD.

1260
01:30:11,533 --> 01:30:12,783
Congratulations.

1261
01:30:12,992 --> 01:30:15,283
Which box should I open next?

1262
01:30:15,992 --> 01:30:17,783
Ahh...Ahh...

1263
01:30:21,408 --> 01:30:23,450
I had a request. - What?

1264
01:30:23,742 --> 01:30:26,617
I had a request. - Yes, what is it?

1265
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:28,700
Does my sister want a diamond ring? - No.

1266
01:30:28,742 --> 01:30:29,992
A return ticket to Dubai?

1267
01:30:30,075 --> 01:30:31,158
Give her a return ticket to Dubai?

1268
01:30:31,242 --> 01:30:35,325
No...we have a brother in Narali. - What does he want?

1269
01:30:35,408 --> 01:30:36,825
What does your brother want? Tell me.

1270
01:30:36,908 --> 01:30:38,367
Children&#39;s cycle. - No.

1271
01:30:38,450 --> 01:30:40,200
What does he want? Dance for him.

1272
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,908
He... - What?

1273
01:30:42,992 --> 01:30:44,908
Just tell me. - You say it.

1274
01:30:45,408 --> 01:30:49,242
You just have to say "Nazir I love you".

1275
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:58,033
What&#39;s the most my sister asked for?

1276
01:30:58,117 --> 01:30:59,450
Just a simple I love you.

1277
01:30:59,783 --> 01:31:01,825
I love you, Nazir.

1278
01:31:01,908 --> 01:31:04,825
ILU. ILU. ILU.

1279
01:31:04,908 --> 01:31:10,325
I love you too, brother. I love you.

1280
01:31:10,867 --> 01:31:13,033
He&#39;s saying that for me.

1281
01:31:13,117 --> 01:31:14,658
Nazir is his family. Why didn&#39;t he took my name !

1282
01:31:14,742 --> 01:31:18,867
The first time you made me say I love you to a man on screen.

1283
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:21,533
Text Raje to make him take my name as well.

1284
01:31:21,617 --> 01:31:24,617
I will return all his money. - Curse you.

1285
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:26,492
Love you. - Let&#39;s come back.

1286
01:31:31,617 --> 01:31:35,075
Let me tell you. You still have two chances.

1287
01:31:35,617 --> 01:31:38,200
These boxes contain 25-kilo gold.

1288
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:40,283
1 Mezan car.

1289
01:31:40,867 --> 01:31:42,283
4 motorcycles.

1290
01:31:42,742 --> 01:31:45,908
And one card...for you bad luck.

1291
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:48,283
If you open that door,

1292
01:31:48,367 --> 01:31:51,492
then everything you won so far will be taken back.

1293
01:31:51,783 --> 01:31:54,783
In fact, these fritters as well.

1294
01:31:57,658 --> 01:32:00,908
So you must play very carefully.

1295
01:32:01,117 --> 01:32:02,283
Slowly.

1296
01:32:02,367 --> 01:32:05,575
Just like "The wind blows slowly".

1297
01:32:05,742 --> 01:32:08,158
"The clouds steer slowly."

1298
01:32:08,408 --> 01:32:10,575
"And love grows slowly..."

1299
01:32:10,658 --> 01:32:12,742
The guy in this song is just like me, isn&#39;t it?

1300
01:32:12,825 --> 01:32:14,242
Never mind, but are you ready to play?

1301
01:32:14,325 --> 01:32:15,908
So which number should I open?

1302
01:32:16,742 --> 01:32:18,742
Raje. Which box? - You say.

1303
01:32:18,825 --> 01:32:19,908
Please tell me.

1304
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:23,908
You say...which box should they open?

1305
01:32:23,992 --> 01:32:28,492
Pray that they should not win anything .....

1306
01:32:28,617 --> 01:32:31,492
Otherwise they will be separated from us

1307
01:32:31,617 --> 01:32:34,158
She has won almost all the household stuff.

1308
01:32:35,908 --> 01:32:37,742
Yes. No. 2.

1309
01:32:38,325 --> 01:32:39,742
Think about it.

1310
01:32:39,908 --> 01:32:40,908
No. 2... Are you sure?

1311
01:32:41,242 --> 01:32:42,742
Should I open it? - Yes.

1312
01:32:42,783 --> 01:32:44,158
Just a minute.

1313
01:32:47,450 --> 01:32:48,408
Yes.

1314
01:32:48,742 --> 01:32:52,992
So lets everyone say "Jeet Ke Le Lo".

1315
01:32:53,742 --> 01:32:56,783
Oh, my... Mezan Car.

1316
01:32:57,492 --> 01:32:59,492
Wow...what good luck.

1317
01:32:59,992 --> 01:33:03,117
Didn&#39;t I tell you they will win a car?

1318
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:04,700
I can&#39;t believe it.

1319
01:33:06,450 --> 01:33:10,825
Car. She won a car. She has such a good fate.

1320
01:33:15,617 --> 01:33:17,617
Go crazy. Go crazy.

1321
01:33:18,492 --> 01:33:20,575
Hug each other

1322
01:33:20,783 --> 01:33:23,700
Brother Aashiq.

1323
01:33:28,908 --> 01:33:30,408
Wow...wonderful.

1324
01:33:30,492 --> 01:33:32,992
But now for your final chance.

1325
01:33:33,450 --> 01:33:37,033
Now you must play carefully. Who is going to tell me the number?

1326
01:33:38,033 --> 01:33:39,700
Raja. - Miru.

1327
01:33:40,075 --> 01:33:42,408
No, you. - You say it.

1328
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:48,408
Wow...what love. What understanding between you two.

1329
01:33:48,492 --> 01:33:49,783
Wow.

1330
01:33:51,367 --> 01:33:53,742
You should learn from them, stupid girl.

1331
01:33:53,992 --> 01:33:55,200
Take my advice...

1332
01:33:55,492 --> 01:33:57,742
Take my advice and let Meeru pick.

1333
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:02,075
Because she is on a hattrick and she has better luck.

1334
01:34:06,367 --> 01:34:07,617
Let me tell you.

1335
01:34:07,825 --> 01:34:12,825
There&#39;s still bad luck card in one of these boxes...

1336
01:34:12,950 --> 01:34:14,783
...which can ruin everything for you two.

1337
01:34:14,867 --> 01:34:20,242
So...carefully, you must play very carefully.

1338
01:34:20,450 --> 01:34:22,033
This is your last chance, Miru.

1339
01:34:22,283 --> 01:34:25,242
It&#39;s either a hit or a miss.

1340
01:34:32,575 --> 01:34:33,742
No.

1341
01:34:34,533 --> 01:34:35,658
Number 7.

1342
01:34:35,908 --> 01:34:37,033
Number 7.

1343
01:34:37,367 --> 01:34:38,492
Think about it.

1344
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:43,117
Seven?

1345
01:34:43,283 --> 01:34:45,825
I&#39;ll go with number 7.

1346
01:34:46,533 --> 01:34:48,075
Have you decided? Sure.

1347
01:34:48,283 --> 01:34:50,117
Let&#39;s see what&#39;s in number 7.

1348
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:57,158
But...if you leave number 7, then I&#39;ll let you open two more boxes.

1349
01:34:57,533 --> 01:34:59,325
No, I&#39;ll go with number 7.

1350
01:34:59,408 --> 01:35:02,325
What is in number 7 that you want to go with number 7?

1351
01:35:02,742 --> 01:35:03,867
What is in it?

1352
01:35:04,492 --> 01:35:07,242
We got married on the 7th.

1353
01:35:07,908 --> 01:35:10,033
Number 7 is lucky for us.

1354
01:35:13,450 --> 01:35:16,450
Your marriage anniversary, huh. Then I will have to open it.

1355
01:35:16,575 --> 01:35:18,908
What do you all say? Shall we open it?

1356
01:35:19,408 --> 01:35:22,992
Everyone say after me "Jeet Ke Le Lo".

1357
01:35:24,783 --> 01:35:27,242
And you&#39;ve scored a hattrick.

1358
01:35:27,492 --> 01:35:31,158
You just won 25-kilo gold.

1359
01:35:31,242 --> 01:35:32,783
Clap.

1360
01:35:33,117 --> 01:35:34,200
Keep clapping.

1361
01:35:34,283 --> 01:35:37,325
Raja won.

1362
01:35:37,408 --> 01:35:42,325
Meeru is the most fortunate girl in Narali.

1363
01:35:42,408 --> 01:35:45,450
Because she has won everything.

1364
01:35:45,742 --> 01:35:48,992
Clap harder. louder.

1365
01:35:52,408 --> 01:35:57,742
So Meeru and Raja have won 25-kilo gold,

1366
01:35:58,033 --> 01:36:02,575
one Mezan car, and electronic appliances

1367
01:36:02,658 --> 01:36:07,033
What will you do with all the things you won, Meeru?

1368
01:36:10,033 --> 01:36:12,658
I have a sister-in-law, Farhana.

1369
01:36:12,742 --> 01:36:14,033
Raja&#39;s sister.

1370
01:36:14,867 --> 01:36:16,950
She had a desire to come on your show.

1371
01:36:17,533 --> 01:36:20,242
She would&#39;ve played much better than us.

1372
01:36:21,450 --> 01:36:24,742
We&#39;ll give all these things away for her dowry.

1373
01:36:27,450 --> 01:36:28,325
Wow!

1374
01:36:29,742 --> 01:36:30,700

1375
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:32,075

Wow!

1377
01:36:35,575 --> 01:36:37,783
You&#39;ll give it to your sister-in-law, all of it.

1378
01:36:38,117 --> 01:36:38,783
Wow!

1379
01:36:39,492 --> 01:36:40,783

See Pakistanis.

1382
01:36:45,783 --> 01:36:47,117
Now that&#39;s an ideal sister-in-law.

1383
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:49,283
That&#39;s an ideal daughter-in-law.

1384
01:36:49,783 --> 01:36:52,408
They are the role models of Pakistan.

1385
01:36:52,492 --> 01:36:53,867
Remember. Remember.

1386
01:36:53,950 --> 01:36:58,867

Your brother is right here.

1388
01:37:03,242 --> 01:37:08,283

1390
01:39:05,242 --> 01:39:09,408
We will check it on our own, you are not a Schumacher

1391
01:39:57,408 --> 01:39:58,325
Careful with that.

1392
01:39:58,408 --> 01:39:59,867
You are very lucky Meeru.

1393
01:39:59,950 --> 01:40:01,575
Send one message for me as well.

1394
01:40:03,033 --> 01:40:04,367
What are you doing?

1395
01:40:04,492 --> 01:40:05,575
Get lost.

1396
01:40:05,742 --> 01:40:07,033
My sister-in-law gave it to me.

1397
01:40:07,117 --> 01:40:09,242
Showing off, loser

1398
01:40:11,408 --> 01:40:14,325
How does Aashiq look in person?

1399
01:40:14,908 --> 01:40:17,283
Why didn&#39;t you choose a different color for the car?

1400
01:40:17,575 --> 01:40:20,033
Small cars looks good in white only ....

1401
01:40:20,117 --> 01:40:23,950
Go fix your cycle first.

1402
01:40:25,075 --> 01:40:26,242
Crazy.

1403
01:40:45,158 --> 01:40:48,325
Rashida, you&#39;ve been blessed with God&#39;s grace.

1404
01:40:48,408 --> 01:40:49,492
Marvelous.

1405
01:40:49,575 --> 01:40:51,242
I just received a really nice proposal.

1406
01:40:51,325 --> 01:40:53,283
Should I talk to them? - Of course.

1407
01:40:53,367 --> 01:40:54,533
What does the boy do?

1408
01:40:55,992 --> 01:40:58,117
My son lives in London.

1409
01:40:58,367 --> 01:40:59,700
He has his own business.

1410
01:40:59,742 --> 01:41:03,158
Cars. Sales and Purchase.

1411
01:41:03,367 --> 01:41:05,658
We&#39;ve been receiving proposals from London as well.

1412
01:41:05,742 --> 01:41:08,033
Because our son looks like a foreigner.

1413
01:41:08,117 --> 01:41:10,075
But we don&#39;t want a foreigner.

1414
01:41:10,158 --> 01:41:12,242
We want someone local.

1415
01:41:12,325 --> 01:41:13,783
Someone raised here.

1416
01:41:14,283 --> 01:41:17,367
Aunty, those girls are good for nothing.

1417
01:41:17,742 --> 01:41:18,950
He&#39;s my only brother.

1418
01:41:19,158 --> 01:41:23,992
We want someone to look after our home and our brother.

1419
01:41:24,742 --> 01:41:27,033
And also cook food.

1420
01:41:30,825 --> 01:41:35,075
So...will the girl go to London after marriage?

1421
01:41:35,158 --> 01:41:42,825
Sister...after the wedding whether she goes to London, or anywhere else...

1422
01:41:42,908 --> 01:41:45,575
...but she is no longer your family.

1423
01:41:45,658 --> 01:41:48,825
By the way, these days people are looking or NRIs.

1424
01:41:49,075 --> 01:41:51,158
There&#39;s a huge demand.

1425
01:41:51,408 --> 01:41:55,325
That reminds me, father. Let&#39;s discuss the demands as well.

1426
01:41:57,950 --> 01:42:02,617
Look here...doesn&#39;t seem nice saying this.

1427
01:42:04,658 --> 01:42:07,117
But I had brought this list along.

1428
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:16,992
No, no, no need to be shy. You can see it later.

1429
01:42:17,867 --> 01:42:19,575
This is a tradition.

1430
01:42:19,742 --> 01:42:23,033
This will save your time, and ours too.

1431
01:42:23,117 --> 01:42:27,367
If this proposal is final, then reject the other proposals.

1432
01:42:29,033 --> 01:42:34,117
Sister Rashida, we&#39;re getting so many proposals you know.

1433
01:42:36,367 --> 01:42:39,408
I think I have seen you somewhere.

1434
01:42:40,325 --> 01:42:41,742
He&#39;s the guy.

1435
01:42:41,825 --> 01:42:44,658
On the game show. - I see...

1436
01:42:44,742 --> 01:42:47,033
That&#39;s amazing. Great.

1437
01:42:47,325 --> 01:42:50,533
I was wondering I&#39;ve seen you somewhere.

1438
01:42:50,742 --> 01:42:52,700
You played so well.

1439
01:42:52,908 --> 01:42:56,867
Your wife has good luck.

1440
01:42:57,742 --> 01:42:59,742
She won 25-kilo gold.

1441
01:42:59,825 --> 01:43:01,367
25 kilo. - Yes.

1442
01:43:01,658 --> 01:43:04,408
No need to give all the gold.

1443
01:43:04,492 --> 01:43:07,700
Just 15-16 will do, isn&#39;t it?

1444
01:43:07,742 --> 01:43:09,742
Keep the rest for your daughter-in-law.

1445
01:43:09,825 --> 01:43:13,117
After all, she won it. - We&#39;ll manage everything.

1446
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:14,992
Don&#39;t worry.

1447
01:43:15,075 --> 01:43:17,033
Allah has blessed us with His grace.

1448
01:43:17,117 --> 01:43:22,867
Sister when you&#39;re prepared to give everything, then it&#39;s a yes from us.

1449
01:43:22,950 --> 01:43:26,158
Congratulations. Bring the sweets.

1450
01:43:27,700 --> 01:43:30,742
Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1451
01:43:37,700 --> 01:43:39,658
Start making preparations.

1452
01:43:39,783 --> 01:43:42,325
From now she&#39;s our daughter.

1453
01:43:47,952 --> 01:43:49,119
No-No-No!

1454
01:43:51,744 --> 01:43:52,785
Mother...

1455
01:43:53,327 --> 01:43:55,702
&#39;The wedding preparations had begun.&#39;

1456
01:43:56,369 --> 01:44:00,994
&#39;Everyone from Narali&#39;s barber to confectioner was happy.&#39;

1457
01:44:01,827 --> 01:44:04,952
&#39;But aunt look happiest.&#39;

1458
01:44:05,994 --> 01:44:09,494
I wish his father was still alive, he would&#39;ve been really happy.

1459
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:15,702
&#39;Dead people are often remembered only during festivals or weddings.&#39;

1460
01:44:17,910 --> 01:44:21,035
Sister&#39;s wedding was like a mix bag of emotions ....

1461
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:23,452
Coming, uncle. Coming. Just a minute.

1462
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:26,660
&#39;Some of the relatives...were too sweet&#39;

1463
01:44:26,744 --> 01:44:28,827
Let me work as well. She is my sister as well.

1464
01:44:28,910 --> 01:44:29,744
Some salty ...

1465
01:44:29,827 --> 01:44:30,952
I&#39;ve been sitting here since morning.

1466
01:44:31,035 --> 01:44:32,535
But no one&#39;s even asked me for a glass of water or a cup of tea.

1467
01:44:32,619 --> 01:44:34,910
Uncle, I&#39;ll offer you tea and water.

1468
01:44:34,994 --> 01:44:37,077
If you say so .... I will stop

1469
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:38,410
That&#39;s more like it.

1470
01:44:38,577 --> 01:44:40,369
Some totally jealous ... burned ...

1471
01:44:40,452 --> 01:44:43,244
If you are giving that much dowry .. an ass can get married ...

1472
01:44:43,327 --> 01:44:44,327
The girl deserves no credit.

1473
01:44:46,702 --> 01:44:50,785
Its the first time someone called me Baby without adding sister.

1474
01:44:51,702 --> 01:44:53,160
You are so funny.

1475
01:44:53,244 --> 01:44:54,910
I cannot wait anymore.

1476
01:44:56,494 --> 01:44:57,410
Me neither.

1477
01:44:57,494 --> 01:45:01,785
&#39;Along with sister&#39;s happiness, her weight was piling up too.&#39;

1478
01:45:02,244 --> 01:45:04,119
&#39;But that wouldn&#39;t make a difference.&#39;

1479
01:45:04,202 --> 01:45:06,119
&#39;The wedding was fixed.&#39;

1480
01:45:06,827 --> 01:45:08,369
&#39;The wedding was four days later..

1481
01:45:08,619 --> 01:45:10,869
and before that was the &#39;Henna ceremony&#39;. &#39;

1482
01:49:27,285 --> 01:49:28,702
Give me some space to get down.

1483
01:49:31,994 --> 01:49:33,869
Everything is just amazing.

1484
01:49:33,952 --> 01:49:36,244
What is this? What happened?

1485
01:49:38,369 --> 01:49:39,494
What has happened?

1486
01:49:44,702 --> 01:49:45,910
What has happened?

1487
01:49:46,410 --> 01:49:50,119
Who jinxed this happy home?

1488
01:49:53,452 --> 01:49:57,202
Uncle. Come quickly. - Allah...

1489
01:49:59,369 --> 01:50:00,744
Allah...

1490
01:50:58,785 --> 01:51:03,369
There was a fridge, Tv. - What else?

1491
01:51:03,452 --> 01:51:06,452
Gold too. - Gold.

1492
01:51:07,994 --> 01:51:10,869
How much gold? - 25 kilo of gold.

1493
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:13,494
25 kilo of gold.

1494
01:51:14,452 --> 01:51:17,035
Are you out of your mind? - No.

1495
01:51:17,327 --> 01:51:19,202
He&#39;s absolutely right. He won it on Tv.

1496
01:51:19,285 --> 01:51:21,827
Just take down our complaint. Why are you stuck on 25-kilos?

1497
01:51:21,910 --> 01:51:23,785
Just sit down. - What&#39;s going on there?

1498
01:51:23,869 --> 01:51:24,619
Come here.

1499
01:51:24,702 --> 01:51:26,285
I&#39;ll take down your FIR.

1500
01:51:26,369 --> 01:51:27,410
Come here.

1501
01:51:27,702 --> 01:51:28,744
Go on.

1502
01:51:29,202 --> 01:51:30,285
Hello. Hello.

1503
01:51:32,285 --> 01:51:33,869
Who went on the show?

1504
01:51:33,952 --> 01:51:34,994
Show off.

1505
01:51:35,369 --> 01:51:36,327
I did, sir.

1506
01:51:37,410 --> 01:51:38,452
Sit.

1507
01:51:39,744 --> 01:51:40,785
Sit.

1508
01:51:47,285 --> 01:51:50,702
How did you get there? - Where?

1509
01:51:51,285 --> 01:51:55,077
The show, where you won the stuff.

1510
01:51:56,744 --> 01:51:57,827
On the bus.

1511
01:51:58,035 --> 01:52:02,785
I mean how did you get a ticket?

1512
01:52:03,077 --> 01:52:05,285
It&#39;s a pass, not a ticket.

1513
01:52:05,369 --> 01:52:09,494
Who has it? - You have to send a message.

1514
01:52:10,327 --> 01:52:13,285
Take this and send a message.

1515
01:52:13,369 --> 01:52:15,077
Sir, just take down our FIR... - Stop it.

1516
01:52:25,994 --> 01:52:27,035
Done, sir.

1517
01:52:27,744 --> 01:52:28,910
When will I get the pass?

1518
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:30,952
There&#39;s no guarantee, sir.

1519
01:52:31,327 --> 01:52:33,202
The pass is only given to the one whose name..

1520
01:52:33,702 --> 01:52:34,952
..is selected in the lucky draw.

1521
01:52:35,035 --> 01:52:37,410
Then why did you waste my time?

1522
01:52:37,869 --> 01:52:38,952
Lucky draw.

1523
01:52:42,035 --> 01:52:44,452
Isn&#39;t there any other way.

1524
01:52:45,202 --> 01:52:48,244
Meaning bribe...

1525
01:52:49,744 --> 01:52:51,035
It&#39;s not a Police Station.

1526
01:52:51,119 --> 01:52:54,744
Get up you rascal, you...

1527
01:52:54,827 --> 01:52:56,910
Please leave him. Spare him.

1528
01:52:56,994 --> 01:52:59,160
Javed, hold him and put him into lock up

1529
01:52:59,244 --> 01:53:01,577
Spare him.

1530
01:53:01,660 --> 01:53:04,785
Forgive me.

1531
01:53:04,869 --> 01:53:06,202
Sir, please forgive him.

1532
01:53:06,369 --> 01:53:08,244
He&#39;s lost all his stuff.

1533
01:53:08,660 --> 01:53:11,952
If you don&#39;t find the stuff back, his sister&#39;s wedding will get canceled.

1534
01:53:12,035 --> 01:53:13,910
We&#39;re at your mercy.

1535
01:53:13,994 --> 01:53:14,827
Come here.

1536
01:53:14,910 --> 01:53:15,702
Apologise.

1537
01:53:15,744 --> 01:53:17,452
Apologise.

1538
01:53:17,994 --> 01:53:19,077
Apologise. Apologise.

1539
01:53:27,035 --> 01:53:28,160
Forgive me.

1540
01:53:31,744 --> 01:53:33,494
No need to apologize.

1541
01:53:34,410 --> 01:53:35,994
Start saving money.

1542
01:53:37,702 --> 01:53:40,744
What did you say? Police Station!

1543
01:53:50,452 --> 01:53:51,952
We are very sad to hear.

1544
01:53:53,744 --> 01:53:55,702
But you lost nothing.

1545
01:53:56,660 --> 01:53:57,827
Just a few clothes.

1546
01:53:59,952 --> 01:54:01,994
Our stuff was stolen.

1547
01:54:02,702 --> 01:54:05,952
We&#39;ll be embarrassed in front of the entire community.

1548
01:54:07,619 --> 01:54:10,994
They will say that there&#39;s some problem with their son...

1549
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:13,910
...that is why they didn&#39;t get any dowry.

1550
01:54:18,410 --> 01:54:20,952
I apologize. - Please, uncle.

1551
01:54:21,160 --> 01:54:22,702
Brother Salim, please don&#39;t leave.

1552
01:54:22,744 --> 01:54:24,035
Uncle, Just sit down.

1553
01:54:24,119 --> 01:54:25,077
Uncle, please...

1554
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:26,744
Brother Salim, please sit down. Sit down.

1555
01:54:26,827 --> 01:54:28,244
Sit down. - Sit down.

1556
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:32,160
We sat down. What now?

1557
01:54:32,660 --> 01:54:33,744
What do you want to say?

1558
01:54:38,910 --> 01:54:41,160
Please don&#39;t cancel the wedding.

1559
01:54:41,744 --> 01:54:43,660
Just give me a couple of months.

1560
01:54:43,744 --> 01:54:46,494
I promise I will give you all the stuff I promised.

1561
01:54:46,577 --> 01:54:47,952
Just a couple of months.

1562
01:54:49,785 --> 01:54:53,369
These days you don&#39;t even get a goat on installments.

1563
01:54:53,702 --> 01:54:55,702
And you&#39;re talking about our son.

1564
01:54:55,952 --> 01:54:57,035
Let&#39;s go, uncle.

1565
01:54:57,577 --> 01:54:58,744
Wasting our time.

1566
01:54:58,827 --> 01:55:01,744
Brother, please reconsider.

1567
01:55:01,827 --> 01:55:03,327
My daughter will die of this shock.

1568
01:55:03,410 --> 01:55:05,577
You also have a daughter....

1569
01:55:05,660 --> 01:55:06,952
What is our fault?

1570
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:08,785
A calamity has befallen on our family.

1571
01:55:08,869 --> 01:55:09,952
We were robbed.

1572
01:55:10,994 --> 01:55:14,577
If the wedding&#39;s canceled now, then who will marry my sister.

1573
01:55:15,119 --> 01:55:17,410
She will stay unmarried forever.

1574
01:55:19,077 --> 01:55:20,119
No, mother.

1575
01:55:20,202 --> 01:55:23,035
Our reputation is at stake here.

1576
01:55:24,827 --> 01:55:26,452
Spare us.

1577
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:29,827
Brother Salim, please listen.

1578
01:55:29,952 --> 01:55:31,035
Brother Salim..

1579
01:55:32,702 --> 01:55:33,160
Wait...

1580
01:55:33,244 --> 01:55:34,452
..please listen.

1581
01:55:34,577 --> 01:55:35,869
Uncle, just a minute.

1582
01:55:37,577 --> 01:55:43,994
I&#39;m prepared to do anything you want. - That&#39;s more like it.

1583
01:55:46,202 --> 01:55:49,535
Look, son. You better gather the stuff for dowry.

1584
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:52,160
Or you can always give cash.

1585
01:55:54,244 --> 01:55:56,369
Can you arrange for 2 million rupees?

1586
01:55:56,702 --> 01:55:57,869
Do you accept?

1587
01:56:04,785 --> 01:56:07,910
If you can arrange it, then the wedding will commence as planned.

1588
01:56:12,410 --> 01:56:13,452
I accept.

1589
01:56:19,077 --> 01:56:21,744
That&#39;s fine, but we have no surety.

1590
01:56:21,952 --> 01:56:24,119
Let&#39;s take the car keys.

1591
01:56:26,369 --> 01:56:27,910
Bring the car keys.

1592
01:56:46,994 --> 01:56:48,160
Congratulations.

1593
01:56:49,035 --> 01:56:50,160
The wedding will go as planned.

1594
01:56:50,619 --> 01:56:51,660
Let&#39;s go.

1595
01:56:57,452 --> 01:56:58,410
Come on.

1596
01:58:57,328 --> 01:58:59,912
Even after selling everything we had, this is all I could arrange for.

1597
01:59:02,370 --> 01:59:04,245
And no one&#39;s ready to lend me money either, Meeru.

1598
01:59:05,828 --> 01:59:06,828
What do I do?

1599
01:59:09,537 --> 01:59:11,870
How do I arrange for so much money overnight?

1600
01:59:13,745 --> 01:59:16,620
Where do I get the dowry for sister Baby?

1601
01:59:23,870 --> 01:59:24,787
Meeru.

1602
01:59:26,662 --> 01:59:29,537
I don&#39;t know what to do, Meeru.

1603
01:59:30,828 --> 01:59:35,037
There is one man...who can help us.

1604
01:59:39,370 --> 01:59:40,537
Who?

1605
01:59:44,912 --> 01:59:45,245
Hello.

1606
01:59:45,328 --> 01:59:46,662
I&#39;ve been calling since morning.

1607
01:59:46,745 --> 01:59:49,453
Please let me talk to him. - Sister, I&#39;ve been telling you..

1608
01:59:49,537 --> 01:59:50,953
..that brother Aashiq isn&#39;t here.

1609
01:59:51,078 --> 01:59:52,162
Wait, just hold on.

1610
01:59:52,245 --> 01:59:54,120
Sir. Some lady on the phone.

1611
01:59:54,495 --> 01:59:56,745
Says that you told her she can call if she needs anything.

1612
01:59:56,828 --> 01:59:58,787
I say that to everyone. Cut it off ...

1613
01:59:58,870 --> 02:00:02,287
Sir, poor girl is crying. She&#39;s crying a lot.

1614
02:00:02,370 --> 02:00:03,203
Poor man.

1615
02:00:03,287 --> 02:00:05,120
You try to help every other poor man. - Sir. Sir.

1616
02:00:05,203 --> 02:00:06,537
Please carry on. - Please, sir.

1617
02:00:07,287 --> 02:00:08,287
Hello. - Hello.

1618
02:00:08,370 --> 02:00:10,703
Who is this? - Meerub speaking from Narali.

1619
02:00:10,787 --> 02:00:12,412
I am in trouble. - Meerub who?

1620
02:00:12,953 --> 02:00:15,370
Narali. The daughter of Narali. Remember.

1621
02:00:15,870 --> 02:00:17,245
Yes, what do you want?

1622
02:00:35,537 --> 02:00:37,953
Okay, you&#39;ll get what you want.

1623
02:00:38,203 --> 02:00:41,703
But, you must help me too.

1624
02:00:54,578 --> 02:00:55,703
You&#39;re the man.

1625
02:01:15,162 --> 02:01:18,162
Dear, say yes.

1626
02:01:29,912 --> 02:01:32,620
You&#39;re looking like a real Queen today.

1627
02:01:33,370 --> 02:01:36,620
You took the right decision by agreeing to my conditions.

1628
02:01:37,912 --> 02:01:41,995
You see, in order to gain some, you also have to lose some.

1629
02:01:42,953 --> 02:01:45,203
You look really cute when you smile.

1630
02:01:45,787 --> 02:01:48,120
I was wondering how you will look while crying.

1631
02:01:49,120 --> 02:01:50,120
Right, aunty?

1632
02:01:51,870 --> 02:01:53,870
A woman crying is a common thing.

1633
02:01:54,953 --> 02:01:58,953
The real fun is when a man cries.

1634
02:01:59,870 --> 02:02:03,870
Shed some tears. A little melodrama.

1635
02:02:05,370 --> 02:02:10,703
People should know how a helpless brother looks like.

1636
02:02:11,828 --> 02:02:12,870
And, I will handle the rest.

1637
02:02:13,412 --> 02:02:15,162
Now get ready all of you.

1638
02:02:15,245 --> 02:02:16,120
Get in the mood.

1639
02:02:16,203 --> 02:02:16,995
Now get ready all of you.

1640
02:02:17,078 --> 02:02:18,078
Get in the mood. Quickly. Quickly.

1641
02:02:27,870 --> 02:02:30,745
Four...Five...Six... - Where is the washing machine?

1642
02:02:31,245 --> 02:02:32,828
It&#39;s right here.

1643
02:02:32,870 --> 02:02:35,578
Does it have a dryer as well? - Yes, it does.

1644
02:02:35,912 --> 02:02:39,703
So many things. Oh my, God.

1645
02:02:39,787 --> 02:02:43,870
In our whole family none of the guy get that much dowry, we are lucky & Smart

1646
02:02:43,912 --> 02:02:47,328
Now there will be a competition in family

1647
02:02:47,578 --> 02:02:50,328
And free popularity .....

1648
02:02:50,412 --> 02:02:53,912
Just imagine, how much I can get for our younger son.

1649
02:02:55,495 --> 02:02:58,245
Brother Aashiq is here. - The Tv people are here.

1650
02:02:59,870 --> 02:03:01,370
Wow, ...same clothes.

1651
02:03:01,662 --> 02:03:03,203
Go on, dear. Take a picture.

1652
02:03:04,078 --> 02:03:04,703
Give them a mobile.

1653
02:03:04,787 --> 02:03:08,370
Brother Aashiq, we are Mister and Mrs Chaudhary Shaukat.

1654
02:03:08,453 --> 02:03:10,662
This is my son&#39;s wedding?

1655
02:03:10,745 --> 02:03:13,370
I see, so you&#39;re the guy who hit the jackpot. - What?

1656
02:03:13,620 --> 02:03:17,745
Yes, ...we raised our son feeding him milk and cream.

1657
02:03:17,828 --> 02:03:18,828
Milk and cream. Wow.

1658
02:03:18,870 --> 02:03:20,537
Brother Aashiq, let&#39;s take a selfie.

1659
02:03:20,620 --> 02:03:22,787
This is a wedding, take all the selfies you want.

1660
02:03:26,703 --> 02:03:28,745
Let&#39;s take a selfie of us.

1661
02:03:50,245 --> 02:03:52,578
I don&#39;t have the strength to host today&#39;s show.

1662
02:03:53,912 --> 02:03:54,870
I don&#39;t have the courage.

1663
02:03:56,287 --> 02:03:58,162
I can&#39;t do it.

1664
02:04:02,078 --> 02:04:08,828
You see, no one can send off their dear daughter without the dowry.

1665
02:04:09,412 --> 02:04:12,745
Dowry adds glory to the wedding.

1666
02:04:13,203 --> 02:04:18,578
But it is our channel XYZ who added this glory to this wedding...

1667
02:04:18,703 --> 02:04:21,328
...by your brother Aashiq Rafaqat.

1668
02:04:22,787 --> 02:04:28,203
This wouldn&#39;t have been a wedding, it would be a mourning.

1669
02:04:29,203 --> 02:04:35,620
Another daughter...would be ready to commit suicide.

1670
02:04:36,953 --> 02:04:38,537
Imagine the plight of a mother..

1671
02:04:39,078 --> 02:04:41,537
..who would be sending off her daughter in a casket...

1672
02:04:41,828 --> 02:04:43,120
...instead of a palanquin.

1673
02:04:45,620 --> 02:04:46,828
How would you feel?

1674
02:04:51,912 --> 02:04:56,453
Son, thank you very much. We&#39;re indebted.

1675
02:04:57,495 --> 02:05:00,245
For saving our honor.

1676
02:05:04,870 --> 02:05:08,370
No-no-no, aunty. Don&#39;t cry.

1677
02:05:08,787 --> 02:05:09,703
Don&#39;t cry.

1678
02:05:09,912 --> 02:05:11,078
Wipe these tears.

1679
02:05:11,453 --> 02:05:12,787
Don&#39;t shed them.

1680
02:05:13,037 --> 02:05:14,037
Wipe these tears.

1681
02:05:14,120 --> 02:05:16,120
Because it&#39;s a joyous occasion.

1682
02:05:16,203 --> 02:05:17,162
Don&#39;t cry today.

1683
02:05:17,412 --> 02:05:18,412
Okay.

1684
02:05:18,745 --> 02:05:25,287
As you can see, when a mother&#39;s feelings can&#39;t be expressed in words...

1685
02:05:26,287 --> 02:05:28,453
...they come out in tears.

1686
02:05:29,328 --> 02:05:31,328
But when she has a daughter-in-law like her..

1687
02:05:31,870 --> 02:05:33,578
..she is a lucky mother-in-law.

1688
02:05:36,537 --> 02:05:41,870
Please tell me, Meeru, when you called me and asked for help...

1689
02:05:42,453 --> 02:05:43,953
...what was the situation in your home?

1690
02:05:44,078 --> 02:05:47,495
What was the uproar in your house? Please tell me.

1691
02:05:51,078 --> 02:05:53,370
We had already lost everything.

1692
02:05:54,787 --> 02:05:55,953
All we had was our honor.

1693
02:05:58,245 --> 02:06:02,787
If you hadn&#39;t helped us out, then we would&#39;ve lost that too.

1694
02:06:05,120 --> 02:06:10,870
Raja tried his best, but he couldn&#39;t have gathered all this stuff.

1695
02:06:11,662 --> 02:06:12,953
We&#39;re indebted to you.

1696
02:06:14,953 --> 02:06:20,412
When Raja failed, the savior came to the rescue.

1697
02:06:21,495 --> 02:06:22,328
This is Raja.

1698
02:06:23,412 --> 02:06:28,287
He...is a brother who is weak.

1699
02:06:29,328 --> 02:06:30,328
He&#39;s feeble.

1700
02:06:31,078 --> 02:06:33,745
He&#39;s helpless and incapable as well.

1701
02:06:34,912 --> 02:06:37,870
I... I became his savior.

1702
02:06:38,620 --> 02:06:42,745
I took the responsibility for his sister&#39;s dowry.

1703
02:06:43,620 --> 02:06:45,537
So tell me, Raja, if it wasn&#39;t for me...

1704
02:06:46,287 --> 02:06:47,912
...then what would&#39;ve happened.

1705
02:06:48,953 --> 02:06:51,995
If it wasn&#39;t for this channel, then what would&#39;ve happened.

1706
02:06:52,995 --> 02:06:55,453
If it wasn&#39;t for this show, then what?

1707
02:06:56,328 --> 02:06:58,245
Would your sister ever get married?

1708
02:07:00,995 --> 02:07:04,162
Could your weak shoulders carry this burden?

1709
02:07:04,870 --> 02:07:07,703
Could you have protected your reputation..

1710
02:07:07,995 --> 02:07:11,370
..if your sister&#39;s wedding had been called off?

1711
02:07:11,912 --> 02:07:14,412
Tell me, could you have kept your reputation intact?

1712
02:07:14,828 --> 02:07:16,370
Look in the camera and say it.

1713
02:07:23,828 --> 02:07:27,953
I couldn&#39;t have. I could never have.

1714
02:07:30,245 --> 02:07:31,828
There are many more brothers like me..

1715
02:07:33,495 --> 02:07:38,703
..who take help of loans because they are weak.

1716
02:07:41,412 --> 02:07:43,828
The walk a few steps, then they are..

1717
02:07:44,870 --> 02:07:46,662
..crushed under the weight of &#39;interest&#39;...

1718
02:07:48,620 --> 02:07:50,412
...and lose their reputation as well.

1719
02:07:54,287 --> 02:07:55,870
But you saved me.

1720
02:07:57,203 --> 02:07:58,787
You took all my responsibility.

1721
02:08:00,537 --> 02:08:03,537
No one in Narali could&#39;ve given this much dowry to his sister.

1722
02:08:04,870 --> 02:08:06,745
You just increased the rate of men.

1723
02:08:07,703 --> 02:08:09,537
The girl&#39;s family will be under more burden now.

1724
02:08:12,287 --> 02:08:13,162
But you&#39;re there.

1725
02:08:15,537 --> 02:08:17,577
How many more weddings can your channel perform?

1726
02:08:18,870 --> 02:08:21,703
100? 200? 300?

1727
02:08:23,287 --> 02:08:26,495
There are a daughter and sister in every home.

1728
02:08:31,078 --> 02:08:34,120
Because this is more of a business than a wedding.

1729
02:08:41,453 --> 02:08:42,370
Now I understand...

1730
02:08:44,412 --> 02:08:46,995
Now I understand why daughters are treated like strangers.

1731
02:08:49,953 --> 02:08:51,328
Take my daughter with jewelry.

1732
02:08:52,328 --> 02:08:53,578
Take my daughter with cash.

1733
02:08:53,995 --> 02:08:55,412
Take my daughter with the car.

1734
02:08:55,495 --> 02:08:56,870
Take my daughter with the plot.

1735
02:08:56,912 --> 02:09:00,412
For God&#39;s sake take my daughter too.

1736
02:09:01,953 --> 02:09:06,495
Everyone wants dowry, no one wants the daughter.

1737
02:09:13,495 --> 02:09:17,328
And while trying to gather the dowry, the daughter gets overaged.

1738
02:09:19,453 --> 02:09:20,495
But it&#39;s our fault.

1739
02:09:22,078 --> 02:09:23,328
It&#39;s our fault.

1740
02:09:24,662 --> 02:09:28,078
We think our daughter will be happy with the stuff.

1741
02:09:29,828 --> 02:09:33,662
But did we ever think whether she will be happy with that man?

1742
02:09:37,078 --> 02:09:40,078
Men try to be very selfless.

1743
02:09:41,953 --> 02:09:45,828
Every selfless, but always sleeps on the bed received in dowry.

1744
02:09:54,828 --> 02:09:58,537
If you&#39;re in need, then ask for a loan, not dowry!

1745
02:10:02,453 --> 02:10:04,203
No one asks for dowry.

1746
02:10:06,037 --> 02:10:09,120
Neither the Law nor our religion. No one.

1747
02:10:11,787 --> 02:10:15,370
But everything goes here. Everything.

1748
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:19,537
And the relationship where everything goes..

1749
02:10:20,370 --> 02:10:22,495
..that relationship hardly prospers.

1750
02:10:25,870 --> 02:10:28,245
If a female sells herself, then she is a courtesan.

1751
02:10:29,328 --> 02:10:32,203
But if the male does the same, then he&#39;s a groom.

1752
02:10:32,287 --> 02:10:34,620
Stop this drama.

1753
02:10:34,953 --> 02:10:36,745
This wedding is canceled.

1754
02:10:37,870 --> 02:10:39,495
This wedding is over.

1755
02:10:39,578 --> 02:10:42,912
What are you saying, Mr. Chaudhary? I beg you. Please stop.

1756
02:10:42,995 --> 02:10:46,703
This family will never be able to face anyone. Think about it.

1757
02:10:46,787 --> 02:10:48,120
What the hell is going on?

1758
02:10:48,828 --> 02:10:50,537
Let&#39;s go, Pops.

1759
02:10:53,453 --> 02:10:55,912
Tony. - My son.

1760
02:10:56,245 --> 02:10:59,745
He got slapped. - And I am relieved.

1761
02:11:12,203 --> 02:11:13,745
Beat them up.

1762
02:11:13,995 --> 02:11:16,203
Run.

1763
02:11:16,578 --> 02:11:19,162
Pops, take me with you!

1764
02:11:19,245 --> 02:11:20,537
Pops!

1765
02:11:34,453 --> 02:11:35,703
Come here.

1766
02:11:35,787 --> 02:11:37,827
Who&#39;s going to return the car keys?

1767
02:11:37,870 --> 02:11:39,662
Get lost.

1768
02:11:43,120 --> 02:11:43,828
Leave.

1769
02:11:43,870 --> 02:11:44,828
Pops.

1770
02:11:45,495 --> 02:11:47,120
Forgive me. Let me go.

1771
02:11:47,203 --> 02:11:49,620
Idiot. Get out. Get lost.

1772
02:11:50,412 --> 02:11:51,578
Live...

1773
02:11:51,662 --> 02:11:52,537
Is it live?

1774
02:11:52,620 --> 02:11:57,078
As you can see, people have awakened against dowry.

1775
02:11:57,162 --> 02:11:58,537
This is a new wave.

1776
02:11:58,787 --> 02:11:59,828
The change has arrived.

1777
02:11:59,995 --> 02:12:00,953
Sister is here...

1778
02:12:04,870 --> 02:12:06,203
Aashiq!
