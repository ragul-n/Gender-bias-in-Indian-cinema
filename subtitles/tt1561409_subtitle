1
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:07,529
I told you that
I would narrate a story to you.

2
00:01:10,259 --> 00:01:11,678
Would you like to listen to it?

3
00:01:11,962 --> 00:01:15,165
This is your and my story.

4
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,394
Hello. This is Biplab.

5
00:01:35,772 --> 00:01:37,515
Do you recognize me?

6
00:01:39,353 --> 00:01:42,083
No.. I was just pulling your leg.

7
00:01:55,084 --> 00:01:58,922
Okay, I won't disturb you.

8
00:02:01,192 --> 00:02:03,111
I'll hang up now.

9
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:13,154
New?

10
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:16,972
Isn't your wife at home?

11
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:18,965
So, she has gone out of station.

12
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:25,096
The kitchen at home is closed
and so you opted for outside food.

13
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:31,430
I've to buy fish.
- At this hour?

14
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:37,495
Of the same breed.
Black mollies for my wife.

15
00:04:39,876 --> 00:04:42,190
Let me check.. he knows me.

16
00:04:42,528 --> 00:04:46,160
Roll down the window and
tell him to give two black mollies.

17
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:48,373
Come on.

18
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:58,439
Excuse me. Two black mollies.

19
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:57,819
Biplab, haven't you returned home yet?

20
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:01,721
Did you've shooting today?

21
00:07:03,513 --> 00:07:05,202
So, you're on the way?

22
00:07:07,044 --> 00:07:08,969
I can't hear anything.

23
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:11,993
Roll up the windows.

24
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,730
Put on the AC.

25
00:07:16,638 --> 00:07:19,915
Yes.. now your voice is clear.

26
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:23,530
Two shifts?

27
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:27,534
You must be very tired.

28
00:07:28,023 --> 00:07:31,351
I can understand.
I.. can understand.

29
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,984
Take rest.

30
00:07:35,896 --> 00:07:38,953
I'll hang up.. call you later.

31
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,980
Why didn't you hang up?

32
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:53,193
So you won't disconnect
as long as I don't?

33
00:07:55,422 --> 00:07:56,757
That's what we promised.

34
00:07:58,142 --> 00:08:00,760
You won't disconnect as long as I don't.

35
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:06,723
You still remember it
but I had forgotten.

36
00:08:08,885 --> 00:08:13,058
I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.

37
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,077
Were you sleeping?

38
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,006
I told you that I would
narrate a story to you.

39
00:08:39,848 --> 00:08:41,217
Would you like to listen to it?

40
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:45,085
This is your and my story.

41
00:08:47,197 --> 00:08:49,393
The story of Kareena and Biplab.

42
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:54,004
The film 'Chameli' that you did..

43
00:08:55,642 --> 00:08:57,821
You were very good in it.

44
00:08:58,903 --> 00:09:02,365
Whenever I see it I remember this story.

45
00:09:04,274 --> 00:09:05,879
Yes, I'll tell you.

46
00:09:38,546 --> 00:09:40,421
The last tram.

47
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,597
I was returning from Khidderpore.

48
00:09:44,222 --> 00:09:46,485
The tram suddenly halted
after some time.

49
00:09:48,225 --> 00:09:51,738
I saw you get inside.

50
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,372
There was no one else
in the tram except an old man..

51
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,052
Sitting at a distance..
He was sleeping.

52
00:09:59,576 --> 00:10:02,009
I suppose he was returning
after attending some conference.

53
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:05,658
The red flag was falling
off his hands again and again.

54
00:10:06,604 --> 00:10:10,624
Some boys got inside the tram.

55
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:17,312
They just went crazy at
your sight and came forward.

56
00:10:18,563 --> 00:10:20,776
One of them even sat next to you.

57
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,999
I noticed how uncomfortable
you were and it made you..

58
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:29,999
Change seats but they went
and sat next to you every time.

59
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:36,655
I couldn't control
myself and sat next to you.

60
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,674
The boys abused me
in the foulest language..

61
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:43,395
Made obscene gestures and got down.

62
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:47,651
The old conductor was busy counting money.

63
00:10:49,695 --> 00:10:52,229
When I got up to go back to my seat..

64
00:10:53,225 --> 00:10:57,448
You held my hands and said..
'Come with me'.

65
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:04,390
This was the first meeting
of Kareena and Biplab.

66
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:13,825
After than Biplab started
visiting Kareena often.

67
00:11:16,298 --> 00:11:18,376
Biplab worked in the ship.

68
00:11:19,963 --> 00:11:22,295
He had brought a binocular for Kareena.

69
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:28,359
She used to look at the
mistress of the brothel..

70
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,656
And your clients through it..

71
00:11:30,736 --> 00:11:33,613
Increasing and decreasing
their sizes according to your wish.

72
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:40,487
Many winters came and went.

73
00:11:41,855 --> 00:11:49,135
One day Biplab said that
he would take Kareena home..

74
00:11:49,862 --> 00:11:51,365
To his neighborhood.

75
00:11:54,017 --> 00:11:55,976
Kareena believed him.

76
00:11:57,648 --> 00:12:04,928
She started waiting for
Biplab to come and take her away.

77
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:09,675
The mistress there told
her that it was impossible..

78
00:12:09,755 --> 00:12:11,600
It was not the norm in brothels.

79
00:12:12,884 --> 00:12:16,482
But Kareena didn't trust them.

80
00:12:18,391 --> 00:12:25,401
Then the evening came when
Kareena sent all her customers away.

81
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,384
She started waiting.

82
00:12:31,921 --> 00:12:35,181
Evening gave way to night..

83
00:12:38,188 --> 00:12:40,130
But Biplab didn't come.

84
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:46,262
The mistress told her
to forget him and start afresh.

85
00:12:46,498 --> 00:12:49,910
She warned that she won't
get customers if she sulks.

86
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,123
Kareena started decking up.

87
00:12:59,116 --> 00:13:03,542
A new man entered her room.

88
00:13:04,572 --> 00:13:07,157
He was ready to pay any amount.

89
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:11,701
He started smoking and
drinking beer continuously.

90
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:27,242
After midnight Kareena
told Alok that she was supposed..

91
00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:32,528
To leave the brothel that day.

92
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:37,393
She told him about Biplab.

93
00:13:38,981 --> 00:13:43,745
The sound of music
was still heard outside.

94
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:50,450
The night gave away to dawn.

95
00:13:51,684 --> 00:13:54,268
Alok came close to Kareena.

96
00:13:55,653 --> 00:13:58,795
He held her hands and started running.

97
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,945
From the room to the
verandah to the stairs..

98
00:14:00,969 --> 00:14:02,899
And then straight into the streets.

99
00:14:04,808 --> 00:14:09,453
They merged with the city
crowd with the first light of dawn.

100
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:13,828
Biplab came next morning.

101
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:17,038
He found the room empty.

102
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,092
Kareena was not there.

103
00:14:22,021 --> 00:14:25,433
Masi came and said that he was late.

104
00:14:28,271 --> 00:14:30,568
She has kept this for you.

105
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:35,872
The mistress returned the binocular.

106
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:41,109
A new girl entered the room.

107
00:14:43,051 --> 00:14:46,970
Biplab gave it to her.

108
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:53,541
Since then as soon as
the sun set the girl would..

109
00:14:54,233 --> 00:15:00,027
Look at the mistress and her
customers through the binocular.

110
00:15:00,804 --> 00:15:05,078
Increasing and decreasing
their size according to her wish.

111
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:14,875
But Biplab and Kareena never met again.

112
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:22,105
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

113
00:15:24,064 --> 00:15:28,540
This is just a story. Just a story.

114
00:15:29,975 --> 00:15:32,104
This is not reality.

115
00:15:34,858 --> 00:15:36,902
The story of Biplab and Kareena.

116
00:17:53,086 --> 00:17:56,413
In open economy we can't have unions.

117
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,153
Who said this?

118
00:17:58,233 --> 00:18:01,160
If there's production,
there'll be a management..

119
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,744
That'll incur both profit and loss.

120
00:18:04,352 --> 00:18:09,318
Earlier the illiterate rustic people
worked in the factories and industries.

121
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,410
They've been replaced
by smartly dressed workers..

122
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,366
Who work in front of
the computer for 12-14 hours.

123
00:18:15,602 --> 00:18:17,460
What's the difference?

124
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,802
You didn't get the computers
when you were supposed to do so.

125
00:18:22,056 --> 00:18:23,801
You suddenly removed English
from the school syllabus.

126
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:26,380
What did you gain?
You had to bring it back.

127
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,268
As a result there's a generation
of Bongs who didn't learn English.

128
00:18:29,348 --> 00:18:31,920
There are many people of
our generation who are scared..

129
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,880
At the sight of a computer.

130
00:18:34,336 --> 00:18:39,234
You couldn't build the foundation
and you want industrialization.

131
00:18:39,314 --> 00:18:46,177
Kalyan, listen to me.. I think
this is not the right time to argue.

132
00:18:46,515 --> 00:18:50,232
It's very clear that
the company is ready to..

133
00:18:50,823 --> 00:18:55,839
Pay six months' salary without work as..

134
00:18:56,837 --> 00:19:02,158
It's going to shut down soon.

135
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:08,113
Should we be busy arguing
at this juncture? No.

136
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:12,991
We must unite and fight.

137
00:19:13,434 --> 00:19:17,319
We must prepare for bigger movements.

138
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,725
So, you want to unite everybody?
That's impossible.

139
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:27,540
Can't you see that someone has
already typed several pages since morning.

140
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,713
Biplab, will you always be busy working?

141
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,078
Come and join us.

142
00:19:35,158 --> 00:19:39,597
Soon your body will become
like a typewriter making weird sounds..

143
00:19:39,677 --> 00:19:42,426
At the slightest touch.

144
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:07,870
Well.. I heard them discussing
that the office will be closed down.

145
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,813
Is it true?

146
00:20:11,016 --> 00:20:13,930
What will I do if that happens?

147
00:20:16,063 --> 00:20:18,470
I don't have anyone.

148
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:42,507
Uncle, this is Sameer speaking.

149
00:21:44,365 --> 00:21:47,722
I told you to sell off everything.
Everything.

150
00:21:48,087 --> 00:21:51,127
I don't want anything. No.. no..

151
00:21:51,617 --> 00:21:56,482
Just keep mother's wedding sari for me.

152
00:21:57,158 --> 00:21:59,151
I want it.

153
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:05,317
Sell the other stuff. Sell them.

154
00:22:07,378 --> 00:22:08,898
Everything.

155
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:26,516
How should I feel?

156
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:28,880
I told him several times
to be here and help me..

157
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,532
When I shut the shop
but he never listens to me.

158
00:22:33,222 --> 00:22:38,003
Worried about the aquarium?
I'll help you with it.

159
00:23:02,969 --> 00:23:06,381
Hello. Biplab here.

160
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,232
What, Urmila? I'm Biplab.

161
00:23:11,026 --> 00:23:13,036
You don't remember me?

162
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:18,458
Try to recall that shooting.. yes..

163
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:21,144
You can't remember me?

164
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,320
The shooting of the
story of a married couple.

165
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:27,124
A highway at the middle of the night.

166
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:32,158
The car went far away as
soon as the shooting started.

167
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:35,519
You were standing on the road.

168
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:40,215
The car came in great speed
with its bright headlights on.

169
00:23:40,925 --> 00:23:45,029
You looked away and asked
for lift in a strange way.

170
00:23:46,449 --> 00:23:48,425
The car came to halt.

171
00:23:49,793 --> 00:23:51,499
You got in.

172
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:54,913
The car went away.

173
00:23:56,248 --> 00:24:00,994
Then a strange game began inside the car.

174
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:04,120
You were no longer a husband and wife.

175
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:06,822
You got into the skin
of a different characters..

176
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,664
Strangers to each other.

177
00:24:09,576 --> 00:24:11,256
You got into the
character of a prostitute.

178
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:14,610
The man was on his way
to a resort to have fun.

179
00:24:15,978 --> 00:24:19,137
Slowly all the masks came off.

180
00:24:19,677 --> 00:24:22,042
The game turned dangerous.

181
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:24,610
You started crying.

182
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,295
The man shouted out angrily.

183
00:24:28,021 --> 00:24:30,437
Just at that moment a truck
from the opposite direction..

184
00:24:30,517 --> 00:24:32,447
Almost bumped into your car.

185
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:42,481
That very night I told
you that the man could kill you.

186
00:24:45,185 --> 00:24:48,885
You placed your head on my shoulders and..

187
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:52,737
Iaughed off saying it was just a film.

188
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:57,753
Now you're saying
that you've forgotten me.

189
00:25:00,692 --> 00:25:03,108
Urmila, actually you haven't forgotten me.

190
00:25:04,205 --> 00:25:06,672
You're trying to forget me.

191
00:25:08,851 --> 00:25:12,685
Okay.. I won't disturb you.

192
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,660
Hello. Biplab here.

193
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:18,393
Rani, This is Biplab speaking.

194
00:26:18,646 --> 00:26:20,149
Do you recognize me?

195
00:26:22,396 --> 00:26:24,440
No.. I was just pulling your leg.

196
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:30,301
I know that you're the one from
whom I never demanded anything.

197
00:26:32,379 --> 00:26:34,035
You also never demanded anything from me.

198
00:26:34,997 --> 00:26:38,308
That's why our bond is so
beautiful even after so many years.

199
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:44,828
I wanted to narrate a story to you.

200
00:26:46,196 --> 00:26:47,767
Would you like to hear it?

201
00:26:48,054 --> 00:26:53,713
Biplab was a caretaker
in a bungalow in Rohini.

202
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:59,827
The nearest marketplace was 10 miles away.

203
00:27:01,972 --> 00:27:04,455
It was a 40 minutes bicycle ride.

204
00:27:05,807 --> 00:27:07,834
Biplab would start early in the morning.

205
00:27:08,983 --> 00:27:16,983
He would shop for the entire
week and return in the afternoon.

206
00:27:25,301 --> 00:27:31,382
Biplab would park his cycle under the
shade of a tree beside the road and rest.

207
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:38,881
At that moment Rani would
walk across the steep uneven paths..

208
00:27:39,523 --> 00:27:41,685
To meet Biplab.

209
00:27:43,932 --> 00:27:47,885
She would take out a clean
lunch box wrapped in a hanky..

210
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,774
And feed Biplab.

211
00:27:52,091 --> 00:27:57,379
She would wrap everything
up and leave after he finished.

212
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:04,524
While riding his cycle Biplab
turned back several times..

213
00:28:08,442 --> 00:28:10,385
But Rani never looked back.

214
00:28:12,294 --> 00:28:16,094
Many years passed by.

215
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:24,305
Rani would wake up early
in the morning and cook for Biplab.

216
00:28:24,844 --> 00:28:29,000
She would walk a long distance
to meet him under the shade of the tree.

217
00:28:30,385 --> 00:28:34,541
She would feed Biplab and
stay back for couple of minutes...

218
00:28:35,503 --> 00:28:37,615
after he finished before she left.

219
00:28:38,644 --> 00:28:43,104
One day Biplab asked her
why she took so much trouble.

220
00:28:43,645 --> 00:28:46,804
He asked her to sit on his bicycle and..

221
00:28:47,632 --> 00:28:52,868
Offered her to come to
the guest house and stay with him.

222
00:28:54,388 --> 00:29:00,334
Rani refused, she had found
happiness in that arrangement.

223
00:29:01,635 --> 00:29:06,973
She loved meeting him and leaving.

224
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:13,899
Happiness doesn't last
if two people stay together.

225
00:29:13,979 --> 00:29:15,638
It doesn't last.

226
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,994
Get up. Come and see.

227
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:26,094
I used to tell you...
the man is walking in his room.

228
00:29:27,294 --> 00:29:29,710
The colorful candles have been lit.

229
00:29:34,761 --> 00:29:36,417
Come and see.

230
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:39,660
Don't disturb me. Go to sleep.

231
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,309
I saw it with my own eyes.
- What?

232
00:29:43,389 --> 00:29:45,370
The candles keep burning
throughout the night.

233
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,211
I even showed it to my husband.

234
00:29:48,377 --> 00:29:50,792
He must be drinking at night.

235
00:29:51,012 --> 00:29:54,458
Nantu's father said he
smelt of alcohol the other night.

236
00:29:54,931 --> 00:29:58,377
Tuli keeps loitering near his room
at night. - Okay.

237
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,992
But who is Tuli?
- Mondol's niece.

238
00:30:02,296 --> 00:30:03,985
The one who water the plants.

239
00:30:05,825 --> 00:30:08,376
Well.. I'm really worried.

240
00:30:08,456 --> 00:30:10,825
We've grown-up girls at home.

241
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,660
It's really a problem if a
middle-aged alcoholic roams around.

242
00:30:15,352 --> 00:30:18,224
I've told Nantu's father
to find out his details.

243
00:30:18,304 --> 00:30:21,788
He has connections in
the police department. - Okay.

244
00:30:22,295 --> 00:30:24,795
My sister's son works in his office.

245
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:27,430
There's some problem in their office.

246
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,592
The office will shut down.

247
00:30:30,386 --> 00:30:33,461
'Long live revolution!'

248
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:36,941
'Long live revolution!'

249
00:30:37,021 --> 00:30:40,387
'Long live revolution!'

250
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:44,424
'Long live the union.'

251
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,937
'Long live the union.'

252
00:30:48,017 --> 00:30:51,654
'Destroy the oppressive management.'

253
00:30:51,941 --> 00:30:54,576
'Destroy the oppressive management.'

254
00:30:54,656 --> 00:30:58,072
'Destroy the oppressive management.'

255
00:30:58,562 --> 00:31:06,113
Friends, when the management
went to the tribunal in 1988..

256
00:31:06,535 --> 00:31:12,802
They said that..
I hope you all remember what they said..

257
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:20,791
They said that a laborer
can't be substituted with machine.

258
00:31:21,939 --> 00:31:24,659
Many years have passed after that.

259
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:28,578
Many years have passed.

260
00:31:28,865 --> 00:31:31,737
It's been twenty years.

261
00:31:32,007 --> 00:31:38,578
The management has closed
down three production units.

262
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,906
What are they trying to hint at?

263
00:31:42,311 --> 00:31:44,355
We know it, friends.

264
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:50,369
We've to get ready
for this tough struggle.

265
00:31:51,737 --> 00:31:55,369
We'll take this vow today.

266
00:31:55,858 --> 00:31:58,324
A tough struggle.

267
00:32:07,852 --> 00:32:12,430
They had closed the gates today.

268
00:32:13,072 --> 00:32:15,032
Will we be allowed inside tomorrow?

269
00:32:15,454 --> 00:32:17,245
Will we be able to retain this job?

270
00:32:17,971 --> 00:32:21,484
Please say something.. you know everybody.

271
00:32:23,664 --> 00:32:27,042
No.. I don't know anyone.

272
00:32:31,045 --> 00:32:34,914
I've heard that the boss likes you.

273
00:32:35,978 --> 00:32:39,289
Please tell him not
to fire me from the job.

274
00:32:40,623 --> 00:32:45,961
Please request him..
If needed I'm ready to stay back at night.

275
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:16,719
Uncle, I told you that I won't go.

276
00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:18,898
Then why do you keep calling me?

277
00:34:20,047 --> 00:34:21,939
Did Sonali call you?

278
00:34:22,344 --> 00:34:25,469
Let her call. I won't go back.

279
00:34:26,684 --> 00:34:28,323
It's been long.

280
00:34:29,539 --> 00:34:32,850
I've gone far away.

281
00:34:33,694 --> 00:34:39,387
Uncle, I won't go. Stay well.

282
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,884
Yes, I'll take care of myself.

283
00:34:43,188 --> 00:34:51,188
Send my mother's wedding sari.
That's all. Nothing else. Bye.

284
00:35:03,475 --> 00:35:05,232
Are you married?

285
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,908
Tell me when you get married.

286
00:35:11,347 --> 00:35:14,911
I'll gift you my mother's wedding sari.

287
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,118
I want to buy fish.
- What kind of fish?

288
00:35:39,422 --> 00:35:41,077
For aquarium.

289
00:35:41,651 --> 00:35:44,151
Let's not stop here.
We'll buy it from our neighborhood.

290
00:35:44,506 --> 00:35:46,601
No, I'll buy it from here.

291
00:35:47,952 --> 00:35:50,520
Okay, as you wish.

292
00:35:58,527 --> 00:36:00,875
Give me two black mollies.

293
00:36:04,676 --> 00:36:08,105
Brother bought fish few days back.
- They died.

294
00:36:08,764 --> 00:36:10,419
They died?

295
00:36:27,006 --> 00:36:29,320
No Priyanka, this can't continue.

296
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:32,276
This can't continue.

297
00:36:32,952 --> 00:36:38,915
I talk to you all and keep
in touch but you all don't care.

298
00:36:39,456 --> 00:36:40,858
Who is this Biplab?

299
00:36:40,938 --> 00:36:42,699
He's a mad fellow.

300
00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:45,030
What's the use of keeping
in touch with him? Isn't it?

301
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:49,304
Can anyone say that I didn't
speak to them when they called me in need?

302
00:36:49,524 --> 00:36:51,230
Can they?

303
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:57,092
I understand.. you don't need me anymore.

304
00:36:58,882 --> 00:37:04,068
I'm helpless..
I spent enough time with you.

305
00:37:04,829 --> 00:37:11,771
When they enjoyed,
romanced, went around with their lovers..

306
00:37:13,122 --> 00:37:16,568
I spent time with you daily.

307
00:37:16,906 --> 00:37:21,197
Can you point out a
single day when I didn't?

308
00:37:22,024 --> 00:37:29,541
Every day I came home
and called all of you.

309
00:37:30,233 --> 00:37:33,713
I called you, Rani, Kareena.. everybody.

310
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:39,558
This is perfect.

311
00:37:40,672 --> 00:37:42,041
This is the norm.

312
00:37:43,899 --> 00:37:46,399
Nothing is permanent.

313
00:37:47,395 --> 00:37:50,487
Old is replaced by new.

314
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:58,072
Tell everybody that Biplab
won't call and disturb anyone.

315
00:37:58,983 --> 00:38:03,358
I'll always be there
to help you when you need me.

316
00:38:04,997 --> 00:38:06,788
I'll hang up now.

317
00:40:13,054 --> 00:40:15,165
Can you hear me?

318
00:40:15,452 --> 00:40:17,074
Please get up.

319
00:40:17,479 --> 00:40:20,554
He's blowing out the candles one by one.

320
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,750
Please get up.

321
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,098
What happened?

322
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:34,220
Can you see how he's walking in his room?

323
00:40:39,018 --> 00:40:41,501
What are you doing?

324
00:40:41,974 --> 00:40:43,629
What are you doing?

325
00:41:27,177 --> 00:41:33,022
Hello Ash. This is Biplab.

326
00:41:34,778 --> 00:41:39,441
You don't know me
but your friends know me.

327
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:46,028
What? You've heard about me?

328
00:41:47,717 --> 00:41:49,305
Who?

329
00:41:50,386 --> 00:41:55,555
Oh! Yes, I've known Rani for a long time.

330
00:41:57,819 --> 00:42:03,308
I don't know why I've called you.

331
00:42:06,331 --> 00:42:10,098
Maybe.. there was an emptiness in my life.

332
00:42:11,687 --> 00:42:13,287
I hope you don't have shooting tomorrow.

333
00:42:13,612 --> 00:42:15,972
If you've any problem in
talking to me then you can tell me.

334
00:42:16,432 --> 00:42:19,203
Everybody complains
that I call them at night..

335
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:20,976
I don't understand their problems.

336
00:42:21,314 --> 00:42:25,098
It's I who understand everybody.
Forget it.

337
00:42:26,281 --> 00:42:30,014
I wanted to get introduced
to you but it didn't happen.

338
00:42:30,977 --> 00:42:33,865
Now that we're talking
let's not discuss those issues.

339
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,936
I don't know if it'll
be appropriate to say this..

340
00:42:38,016 --> 00:42:44,525
On our very first conversation.
But, I want to meet you.

341
00:42:46,906 --> 00:42:54,906
Ash, will you accept my
invitation to come to my place?

342
00:42:59,102 --> 00:43:03,934
What? What did you say? You'll come?

343
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:11,755
I knew.. I knew you
would understand Biplab.

344
00:43:13,105 --> 00:43:15,555
Yes, I'm elated.

345
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:21,924
I spoke to you and
here begins a new story.

346
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:26,890
Aishwarya and Biplab's story.

347
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:31,855
I didn't get today's newspaper.

348
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:34,828
It's a new delivery boy. He's whimsical.

349
00:45:35,485 --> 00:45:37,833
You're back home early today.

350
00:45:49,269 --> 00:45:52,867
If you come and ask anyone near
the shop that sells fish next to bypass..

351
00:45:53,425 --> 00:45:54,709
They'll guide you.

352
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:59,473
Climb up the stairs and come upstairs.

353
00:46:00,638 --> 00:46:06,128
When I hear the sound of
your heels I'll wait near the door.

354
00:46:07,716 --> 00:46:12,378
The sound will get louder
and stop near my door.

355
00:46:14,321 --> 00:46:16,703
You'll knock at the door.

356
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,517
I'll move back without make any sound.

357
00:46:22,987 --> 00:46:27,108
Then you'll hear my footsteps
as I come forward and open the door.

358
00:46:29,185 --> 00:46:33,155
You'll smile at me.

359
00:46:33,644 --> 00:46:38,644
I'll slowly pour wine in my wine glass.

360
00:46:39,944 --> 00:46:43,373
I'll share the wine with you.

361
00:46:44,978 --> 00:46:47,630
The gentle breeze will
blow the window curtains.

362
00:46:48,609 --> 00:46:50,839
They'll fall on your face.

363
00:46:51,431 --> 00:46:54,860
I'll try to keep them
away from some time..

364
00:46:56,667 --> 00:46:58,762
But after some I won't.

365
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:02,579
The curtain will repeatedly
come and fall on your face.

366
00:47:03,389 --> 00:47:08,068
It'll dishevel your tresses.

367
00:47:09,589 --> 00:47:16,920
You'll suddenly want to see my bathtub.

368
00:47:18,102 --> 00:47:20,669
You love bathing in the bath tub.

369
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,770
So, do I.

370
00:47:26,767 --> 00:47:31,649
We'll switch off the lights in the room.

371
00:47:33,118 --> 00:47:35,483
Only the lights in the
bathroom will remain switched on.

372
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:41,007
The smoke from the hot
water will fill the bathroom.

373
00:47:41,632 --> 00:47:47,645
We'll hold hands and
take bath in the bath tub.

374
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:53,423
You'll leave behind your
lip marks on the bathroom glass.

375
00:47:55,501 --> 00:48:03,501
Slowly.. the smoke will disappear..
The water will become cold.

376
00:48:07,139 --> 00:48:15,139
I'll watch your lip
mark gradually disappear.

377
00:48:17,257 --> 00:48:19,436
I'll keep staring.

378
00:48:24,283 --> 00:48:25,330
Welcome back.

379
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:27,915
You're listening to Radio
Mirchi 98.3 FM. It's hot.

380
00:48:27,995 --> 00:48:30,094
Riya is back to chat
with you this evening.

381
00:48:30,174 --> 00:48:33,996
Call me at 22822282.

382
00:48:34,076 --> 00:48:37,138
Let me share some fantastic
news with you first.

383
00:48:37,218 --> 00:48:40,803
I'll play a awesome
song to celebrate the news.

384
00:48:40,883 --> 00:48:44,570
Shall I share the news first or the song?
Well, I'll share the news.

385
00:48:44,823 --> 00:48:46,850
Today is Aishwarya Rai's birthday.

386
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:51,665
If you want to wish her
then send a sms at 58582.

387
00:48:51,745 --> 00:48:55,635
Lucky winners will get
a chance to dine with Aishwarya.

388
00:48:55,715 --> 00:48:57,037
Do you want to avail the chance?

389
00:48:57,117 --> 00:48:59,774
Here's a wonderful song
for you for the time being.

390
00:49:23,472 --> 00:49:29,841
Believe me, Ash.. there was a clear
distinction between my day and night.

391
00:49:30,618 --> 00:49:33,743
Everything is merging together now.

392
00:49:35,753 --> 00:49:38,067
I can see your face
while travelling by tram.

393
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:41,058
I miss you when I'm in office.

394
00:49:42,038 --> 00:49:44,301
I can't work properly.

395
00:49:46,345 --> 00:49:48,389
I don't like going out.

396
00:49:50,433 --> 00:49:55,449
I want to go home and talk to you.

397
00:49:57,628 --> 00:49:59,655
It never happened before.

398
00:50:01,733 --> 00:50:03,760
Why is it happening now?

399
00:50:04,571 --> 00:50:07,645
Has Biplab fallen in love with Ash?

400
00:50:09,622 --> 00:50:11,513
I think so.

401
00:50:13,236 --> 00:50:14,824
What about you?

402
00:50:15,922 --> 00:50:17,966
I know that you too feel the same.

403
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:25,179
Ash, I want to marry you.

404
00:51:10,633 --> 00:51:13,656
So, you're almost done
with your wedding shopping.

405
00:51:14,028 --> 00:51:18,235
I hope you remember that
I'll give you the wedding sari.

406
00:52:11,648 --> 00:52:13,439
Dad..

407
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,945
It's late. Let's go home.

408
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:50,187
Listen.. what's going on?

409
00:53:50,267 --> 00:53:54,376
I've recently noticed
that he comes home with..

410
00:53:54,456 --> 00:53:58,531
Lots of shopping bags.

411
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:00,929
As if he's busy shopping for his wedding.

412
00:54:01,009 --> 00:54:03,025
Have you heard anything?
- No..

413
00:54:03,105 --> 00:54:05,862
I hope he doesn't elope with our Tuli.

414
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:09,173
What do you know about Tuli
that you're so worried about her?

415
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:11,825
I don't see any problem if
anybody takes her responsibility..

416
00:54:11,905 --> 00:54:13,413
And marries the motherless girl.

417
00:54:14,748 --> 00:54:16,471
Listen.. don't say such silly things.

418
00:54:16,551 --> 00:54:18,329
How will he manage?

419
00:54:18,409 --> 00:54:19,689
How will he manage her expenses?

420
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,410
The other day you told us that
his office is going to be shut down.

421
00:55:11,134 --> 00:55:15,137
We've to change the management.
- This can't be allowed to continue.

422
00:55:20,156 --> 00:55:21,473
I'm scared.

423
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,872
Please accompany me downstairs.

424
00:55:28,263 --> 00:55:29,851
Okay, come.

425
00:55:44,259 --> 00:55:47,604
So finally you're going
around with a widow?

426
00:56:05,223 --> 00:56:07,436
The wedding shopping is almost over.

427
00:56:08,061 --> 00:56:10,223
The wedding invitations
are also getting ready.

428
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:13,990
There's problem in my office..
Bomb blasts.

429
00:56:15,308 --> 00:56:17,183
I didn't tell you earlier..

430
00:56:17,673 --> 00:56:22,335
No.. I didn't tell you earlier
as you would unnecessarily be worried.

431
00:56:23,635 --> 00:56:25,915
Forget it.

432
00:56:26,236 --> 00:56:31,456
I saw one of your posters
put up on a mobile van.

433
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:35,257
It was passing by my house.

434
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,463
As long as I was looking
at it I was feeling good.

435
00:56:46,558 --> 00:56:53,466
But as soon as it went
away I started feeling scared.

436
00:56:54,818 --> 00:56:59,378
I felt what if I can't see you again?

437
00:57:01,304 --> 00:57:05,257
Ash, I hope this doesn't happen.

438
00:57:07,098 --> 00:57:09,311
I hope you won't leave me.

439
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:16,338
I knew that this would be your answer.

440
00:57:18,517 --> 00:57:23,128
Yet I want to narrate a story to you.

441
00:57:24,767 --> 00:57:28,889
Story of Ash and Biplab.

442
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,852
A winter night in the city.

443
00:57:36,034 --> 00:57:39,361
That side of the city was deserted.

444
00:57:40,257 --> 00:57:45,798
Ash was standing on a small bridge. Alone.

445
00:57:46,288 --> 00:57:47,960
She was waiting.

446
00:57:48,585 --> 00:57:54,615
Some drunkards noticed
her from the other side.

447
00:57:55,831 --> 00:57:58,264
They teased and misbehaved with her.

448
00:57:58,838 --> 00:58:02,470
Biplab was returning home at that time.

449
00:58:03,163 --> 00:58:08,112
The guys went away when they saw Biplab.

450
00:58:09,379 --> 00:58:15,527
That was the first
meeting of Biplab and Ash.

451
00:58:17,165 --> 00:58:22,114
You promised to meet at the same place,
same time.

452
00:58:23,568 --> 00:58:27,537
We met the next day
and then the day after.

453
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:35,223
Then one day I noticed your lover
coming from the opposite direction..

454
00:58:35,747 --> 00:58:37,723
Of the bridge.

455
00:58:38,905 --> 00:58:41,524
The person you were waiting for.

456
00:58:42,217 --> 00:58:46,845
You hugged each other with joy and love.

457
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,132
Both of you walked across
the bridge and got lost.

458
00:58:52,993 --> 00:58:58,112
Biplab walked home
alone on that winter night.

459
00:58:59,851 --> 00:59:02,790
Will you go away, Ash?

460
00:59:04,192 --> 00:59:07,723
I don't know why I get such thoughts.

461
00:59:39,514 --> 00:59:41,648
Did you read the recent edition
of Anandalok (film magazine)?

462
00:59:41,672 --> 00:59:44,412
Well, the news is out everywhere.

463
00:59:44,492 --> 00:59:46,005
It's bound to be the talk of the town.

464
00:59:46,029 --> 00:59:50,020
After all a celebrity like
Ash is getting married to Abhisekh.

465
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:51,951
Do you think the TV channels
will let go off this opportunity?

466
00:59:51,975 --> 00:59:54,851
They'll go for a live
telecast of the wedding.

467
01:00:32,774 --> 01:00:38,163
I'll reach home before evening
if I get the local scheduled at 1:40.

468
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:43,264
I've a meeting at night.

469
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,246
Let's see..

470
01:00:51,996 --> 01:00:53,753
If I get the job.

471
01:01:14,767 --> 01:01:16,102
Hi! This is Brishti.

472
01:01:16,182 --> 01:01:17,876
Let's start with today's headlines.

473
01:01:17,956 --> 01:01:19,396
It's not a rumor.

474
01:01:19,476 --> 01:01:22,335
Aishwarya is getting married
into the Bachchan family.

475
01:01:22,415 --> 01:01:25,375
She'll get married to Abhisekh
Bachchan on 20th April.

476
01:01:25,662 --> 01:01:29,648
Our correspondent Joydeep Ghosh
visited different places in Kolkata.

477
01:01:29,885 --> 01:01:33,365
Let's hear what the common
people have to say about the wedding.

478
01:01:33,445 --> 01:01:38,128
She's getting married? That's great news.

479
01:01:38,433 --> 01:01:42,149
But I just hope this marriage
in the film industry lasts.

480
01:01:43,146 --> 01:01:46,406
Not interested. I don't watch Bollywood.

481
01:01:46,486 --> 01:01:48,163
Sorry, I don't.

482
01:01:48,243 --> 01:01:51,322
I've been close to both
of them for a long time.

483
01:01:51,745 --> 01:01:54,650
I think they'll make a very nice pair.

484
01:01:56,846 --> 01:02:00,731
I've good relationship with both of them.

485
01:02:01,745 --> 01:02:04,617
I've watched them together
during my film's shooting.

486
01:02:06,221 --> 01:02:10,275
I think they've got a very
good chemistry between themselves.

487
01:02:11,778 --> 01:02:13,164
Yeah.

488
01:02:19,312 --> 01:02:22,538
We're sorry.
The number you've dialed does not exist.

489
01:02:23,113 --> 01:02:25,393
Please check the number.

490
01:02:51,322 --> 01:02:54,346
Radio Mirchi 98.3 FM. It's hot.

491
01:02:54,426 --> 01:02:57,319
The evening conversation
has got hotter with Ria.

492
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:59,819
Let's begin with an awesome news.

493
01:02:59,899 --> 01:03:04,345
All questions and doubts
will be put to rest this 20th April.

494
01:03:04,425 --> 01:03:06,378
Aishwarya Rai,
ex-Miss World is soon going to be..

495
01:03:06,402 --> 01:03:08,095
A part of the Bachchan family.

496
01:03:08,175 --> 01:03:11,423
They were in relation for a long
time but it didn't end in a break-up.

497
01:03:11,503 --> 01:03:13,264
It's finally culminating in marriage.

498
01:03:13,344 --> 01:03:15,612
And I think they'll be
the best couple in Bollywood.

499
01:03:15,692 --> 01:03:21,017
If you want to wish the celebrity
couple send a sms at 58582.

500
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:23,247
The lucky winners will
get a chance to be present..

501
01:03:23,327 --> 01:03:24,666
At Ash-Abhi's reception.

502
01:03:24,746 --> 01:03:26,102
Won't you grab this chance?

503
01:03:26,182 --> 01:03:31,137
Keep listening to Radio
Mirchi 98.3 Fm with Ria. It's hot.

504
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:34,496
Hello. Joseph?

505
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:38,229
Is she really..

506
01:04:40,442 --> 01:04:42,570
She could've shared with me.

507
01:04:44,344 --> 01:04:46,354
I wouldn't have stopped her.

508
01:07:00,814 --> 01:07:02,013
Hello. This is Brishti.

509
01:07:02,093 --> 01:07:03,770
Let's start with today's headlines.

510
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:05,104
A shocking news from Bollywood.

511
01:07:05,184 --> 01:07:07,250
A young man suddenly
attacked Aishwarya Rai when..

512
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:10,139
She was returning home after shooting.

513
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:12,250
She has narrowly escaped death.

514
01:07:12,588 --> 01:07:15,257
She was admitted in
Leelavati hospital yesterday.

515
01:07:15,337 --> 01:07:17,216
She's out of danger.

516
01:07:17,486 --> 01:07:20,949
It's suspected that she was
attacked by her dejected secret lover..

517
01:07:21,202 --> 01:07:23,685
On hearing her wedding news.

518
01:07:23,765 --> 01:07:26,928
Our correspondent Joydeep
Ghosh is with the people.

519
01:07:27,008 --> 01:07:29,868
Let's hear what's the public reaction.

520
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:36,236
What? I just heard about
her wedding and now she's injured.

521
01:07:36,861 --> 01:07:39,986
It's difficult to understand
the complexities of film industry.

522
01:07:40,425 --> 01:07:42,047
You've come to me again?

523
01:07:42,283 --> 01:07:45,172
I told you I don't watch Bollywood.
I told you.

524
01:07:45,442 --> 01:07:47,215
I'm not interested. Not interested.

525
01:07:47,295 --> 01:07:49,242
Sorry. Next time.

526
01:07:49,513 --> 01:07:52,536
Very sad and very unfortunate.

527
01:07:53,668 --> 01:07:59,952
This is just an instance that proves
the increasing violence in our society.

528
01:08:01,455 --> 01:08:05,290
I've dealt with such
issues in my film too.

529
01:08:07,503 --> 01:08:12,672
Whenever I recall Ash's
face I feel sad for her.

530
01:08:15,814 --> 01:08:17,858
I don't wish to state anything further.

531
01:08:17,938 --> 01:08:20,021
Please switch off the camera.

532
01:08:20,443 --> 01:08:22,487
Please stop it.

533
01:09:24,411 --> 01:09:26,404
So, you finally did it.

534
01:09:26,484 --> 01:09:29,715
The vermilion box is
still lying on the road.

535
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:48,380
The blood stains are still on your shirt.

536
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:50,660
Wash them after going home.

537
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:07,333
Don't stay here long.

538
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:13,009
Can't you see that
everybody is staring at you?

539
01:11:26,726 --> 01:11:28,854
Dad..

540
01:15:40,389 --> 01:15:41,994
Two Black Mollies.

541
01:17:13,832 --> 01:17:17,008
Revolution!

542
01:17:18,713 --> 01:17:22,041
We want to fight.

543
01:17:56,855 --> 01:17:59,760
Need to buy fish for the aquarium.

544
01:18:00,132 --> 01:18:04,861
Good. Let's finish the chores
today and we can enjoy a holiday tomorrow.

545
01:18:05,301 --> 01:18:07,294
We'll buy the fish from
the shop near our house.

546
01:18:07,374 --> 01:18:08,443
No.

547
01:18:08,523 --> 01:18:13,071
We'll buy them from the usual place.
- As you wish.

548
01:18:23,798 --> 01:18:25,858
Two black Mollies.

549
01:18:38,611 --> 01:18:41,601
What name have you kept for the baby?
- Duniya (world).
