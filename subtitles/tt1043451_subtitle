1
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,487
In every speck shines His divine light

2
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,903
Look within yourself,
He isn't far from you

3
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:53,423
If you have love in you,
then embrace everyone

4
00:01:54,286 --> 00:01:56,494
Because we are all in His form.
That's worship

5
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:18,284
What would have happened
if the red-headed man...

6
00:02:18,668 --> 00:02:20,491
...hadn't woken up at dawn that day
to relieve himself?

7
00:02:21,644 --> 00:02:26,219
Perhaps life would have carried
on in Delhi-6 as it had for centuries

8
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:30,155
And my life might not have been
turned upside down

9
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,130
But then again

10
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,106
When you got to go, you got to go!

11
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:31,238
In the Treta Age of the Vedic era

12
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:33,541
The evil ten-headed Ravan ruled supreme

13
00:03:38,436 --> 00:03:42,948
The Sun, Moon, Wind and Fire
were enslaved to Ravan

14
00:04:03,265 --> 00:04:05,665
Who could save the universe from Ravan?

15
00:04:12,674 --> 00:04:16,609
A divine voice spoke: "I will be born
as Ram in Awadh to save you"

16
00:04:28,512 --> 00:04:31,360
The tumour is close to her area of vision

17
00:04:40,191 --> 00:04:43,646
Fatima, ask the fool how long I've got?

18
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:46,526
Ma, don't say that! Allah forbid it

19
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:13,371
Who do you have in India?

20
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,402
Did these five years with us bore you?

21
00:05:17,595 --> 00:05:21,818
No, child. But you must merge with
the soil on which you are born

22
00:05:22,106 --> 00:05:24,217
Ma, these are old proverbs

23
00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:29,210
Son, think of it as my last wish

24
00:05:29,786 --> 00:05:32,665
Ma, you're like a stubborn child

25
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,745
You make life difficult

26
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:38,106
You know I'll never go back to Delhi.

27
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:12,246
I couldn't see well in the dark.
He was 8ft. 2

28
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,549
Covered in black hair

29
00:06:15,222 --> 00:06:17,909
His nails shone like knives

30
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,268
Anyone who dares to sleep is dead!

31
00:06:21,653 --> 00:06:24,724
He'll creep up on you at night

32
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,236
He'll kill you. Murder you. Who is he?

33
00:06:31,732 --> 00:06:34,420
Yes! The murderer is a monkey

34
00:06:34,804 --> 00:06:36,531
A dark Black Monkey!

35
00:06:36,723 --> 00:06:40,530
The Black Monkey kills.
The Black Monkey murders

36
00:06:41,106 --> 00:06:44,946
Beware! 24/7. From Delhi, Kumar

37
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:48,402
The first one to welcome me
to Delhi was the Black Monkey

38
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,530
Maybe destiny was sending me a sign

39
00:06:57,425 --> 00:06:58,769
Would you care for a paan?

40
00:07:00,304 --> 00:07:01,360
Salaam, Mrs. Mehra

41
00:07:06,353 --> 00:07:07,984
Now I can die in peace

42
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,449
My love dragged you back, didn't it?

43
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:17,743
I forgot all about you

44
00:07:18,511 --> 00:07:19,471
Recognise him?

45
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:27,055
At last! Now my eyes can rest
forever now. Let me hug you

46
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:29,454
Come on! Give me a hug

47
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,390
I'm Ali Baig!

48
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:03,020
A flood of people!
Delhi is teeming with life

49
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:08,298
Everything happening at the same time.
Yet there is a kind of balance

50
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:22,378
You can't enter like this

51
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:24,585
First sweeten your mouth

52
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:26,217
Mamdu! How are you?

53
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:27,752
You're back at last!

54
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,209
Salaams, Hina! My sister-in-law

55
00:08:32,552 --> 00:08:36,391
Why the long face?
Aren't you looking after her?

56
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,559
Gobar! Bless you, son

57
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,440
Guess who's here!
My grandson. Roshan

58
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:46,535
He isn't hungry

59
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:50,951
Only dogs eat when they're hungry.
Humans eat to bond with each other

60
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:52,294
Have one

61
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:56,997
Only the lucky few taste
Mamdu's sweets

62
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,069
Or you can't go through

63
00:09:02,182 --> 00:09:04,485
My beloved has returned home

64
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:17,988
People have great faith in this place

65
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:21,443
They say if you hang a bell
with a pure heart

66
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:23,747
God will heed you

67
00:09:24,227 --> 00:09:26,435
I hung a bell before I left and prayed...

68
00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:30,082
...to return with my whole family

69
00:09:30,563 --> 00:09:33,538
God heard me. At least in part

70
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:45,634
Home at last! Your Paswaan Lane

71
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:47,169
It's hasn't changed a bit

72
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,993
Your phone is ringing

73
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:51,649
Not mine

74
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:03,360
You must rest. I'll take your leave

75
00:10:03,648 --> 00:10:06,527
- Have tea with us
- Some other time

76
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,447
Make sure you drop by

77
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,046
That's my ball

78
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,059
Got it!

79
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:39,516
Mrs. Mehra is back

80
00:10:42,396 --> 00:10:44,988
- How are you, Rajjo?
- You look lovely

81
00:10:46,908 --> 00:10:51,994
Welcome to Delhi 6. How do you do?
I am Rajjo

82
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:55,610
Rama!

83
00:11:00,505 --> 00:11:02,425
Rama. Bless you

84
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:08,473
A local speciality

85
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,353
Home at last!

86
00:11:16,248 --> 00:11:18,744
Roshan! Unlock the door

87
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,679
- Which one?
- The small one

88
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:50,006
The tulsi plant has dried. Some water

89
00:11:50,484 --> 00:11:52,213
No water now

90
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:54,900
The tap runs only in the morning

91
00:11:55,284 --> 00:11:57,652
It's like the government.
Works on a whim

92
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,683
Nothing like Mother Earth!

93
00:12:03,124 --> 00:12:04,371
I was just 16

94
00:12:05,043 --> 00:12:07,251
Your grandfather married me
and brought me here

95
00:12:09,267 --> 00:12:12,146
I'll leave the world from this place now

96
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:20,594
Gran...

97
00:12:23,762 --> 00:12:24,721
This way

98
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,233
Don't waste water. It's precious

99
00:12:30,736 --> 00:12:36,689
Overflowing with emotion.
That's the beauty of India for you

100
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:40,145
Love is never given in small doses

101
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:50,319
Here, taps may run dry.
But amazingly tear ducts never do

102
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:57,423
Your grandfather! He never accepted
your parents' marriage

103
00:12:58,286 --> 00:12:59,343
Never listened to anyone

104
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,518
"How is it possible?"

105
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:03,629
It chewed him up till he died

106
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:08,525
He'd say: "How can my son
marry a Muslim?"

107
00:13:09,484 --> 00:13:11,117
I wasn't happy either

108
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:13,710
When I got to know your mother...

109
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:15,630
...I knew I was wrong

110
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,412
Damn it!

111
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:20,332
Must the power go now?

112
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,308
Your father was just as stubborn

113
00:13:23,692 --> 00:13:26,188
My husband said: "Get out!"
So he left

114
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,395
And refused to come back

115
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:31,563
Except for once.
For your grandpa's funeral

116
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,604
See God's miracle, Roshan?

117
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,427
You were born on the same night

118
00:13:36,811 --> 00:13:39,594
"Everything that happens is God's will"

119
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:46,409
Only his moustache sets you apart

120
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:57,449
You're still not ready?

121
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:06,248
Ravan is on his way to kidnap Sita

122
00:14:06,536 --> 00:14:08,456
My scarf! Hey, mister

123
00:14:09,703 --> 00:14:12,200
Can't you see? Shall I buy you specs?

124
00:14:19,783 --> 00:14:20,743
Gran!

125
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:28,614
Lord Ram was born in Awadh
to put an end to all suffering

126
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,429
Salaams, Mrs. Mehra

127
00:14:36,102 --> 00:14:37,413
Mamdu? Right?

128
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:41,540
I can't enter without eating
something sweet, right?

129
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,547
How are you, Madangopal?

130
00:14:48,643 --> 00:14:50,083
Well. Thanks to the Goddess

131
00:14:50,276 --> 00:14:52,868
Bittu! Isn't she Bittu?

132
00:14:53,732 --> 00:14:56,995
How thin you are.
You were once so chubby

133
00:14:57,283 --> 00:14:58,915
You're a stick now

134
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,986
- Her American grandson
- Must I dance for joy?

135
00:15:02,371 --> 00:15:05,250
Roshan. She's Bittu. Their daughter

136
00:15:11,363 --> 00:15:15,490
- 20 rupees from me
- And a donation of 50 from me

137
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,944
Why be stingy with
the Benevolent One? Right?

138
00:15:20,193 --> 00:15:21,441
Miserly with his sister...

139
00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:23,552
...but loves showing off in public

140
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:27,872
You brothers never stop fighting.
Have you no shame?

141
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,696
You look dashing!

142
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:36,127
Young man, not Miss. Mrs!

143
00:15:37,183 --> 00:15:41,215
Myself Jaigopal Sharma,
proprietor Jaigopal Electrical Works

144
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,351
I won the contract
for all the lighting. Right?

145
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:47,230
Donation, Mrs. Mehra

146
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:49,726
Gobar! Don't pester her. Come here.

147
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,238
What will you take?

148
00:15:55,102 --> 00:15:58,365
One ten-rupee note?
Or two one-rupee coins?

149
00:15:59,517 --> 00:16:03,068
One ten-rupee note?
Or two one-rupee coins?

150
00:16:04,316 --> 00:16:06,524
One note? I'll take two coins

151
00:16:09,597 --> 00:16:11,516
He's got straw for brains

152
00:16:17,051 --> 00:16:19,931
Time for a group photo.
Paswaan Lane! Stand close together

153
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,074
Are we in?

154
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:33,082
My star of Delhi-6. When are you
heading to Mumbai?

155
00:16:33,465 --> 00:16:36,441
I can go anytime.
I'm giving the others a chance

156
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:41,625
Don't forget the 2500 you owe me!
Right?

157
00:16:42,104 --> 00:16:45,431
Jaigopalji, forget about me.
Tell me about your shirt. By God!

158
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,601
I had better visit Malayasia too

159
00:16:48,793 --> 00:16:52,440
Look! The moneylender's wife
is decked out like his jewellery store

160
00:16:53,496 --> 00:16:55,992
So our wives nag us
to buy the same jewels

161
00:16:56,376 --> 00:16:58,487
Then pawn them right back to him

162
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,559
Let me photograph you
and your lovely wife

163
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,014
Greetings, Annapurnaji

164
00:17:06,454 --> 00:17:08,087
Pay your respects!

165
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,198
May you both live long!

166
00:17:10,486 --> 00:17:12,405
Lalaji! Meet Rajan's son.
Roshan

167
00:17:16,053 --> 00:17:18,037
Are you here to stay?

168
00:17:18,229 --> 00:17:20,149
No. I came to leave her

169
00:17:20,341 --> 00:17:21,877
What's your name?

170
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:23,604
Roshan Mehra

171
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:29,365
Any plans for the house?

172
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,284
Lalaji, I'm still alive!

173
00:17:31,573 --> 00:17:35,508
- I'll fetch you a good price
- Can family heritage be sold?

174
00:17:35,795 --> 00:17:37,427
There's no family left

175
00:17:37,812 --> 00:17:40,307
Money is better than bricks and mortar.
Right, son?

176
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:49,138
You burger species!

177
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:53,233
With an arrow as sharp as His gaze

178
00:17:55,153 --> 00:17:56,498
He stuck the golden deer

179
00:17:57,649 --> 00:18:00,625
The golden deer
changed into the demon Marich

180
00:18:02,545 --> 00:18:04,945
O Brother Laxman!
Ram is calling for help

181
00:18:10,608 --> 00:18:15,216
As Laxman leaves,
the demon king Ravan appears

182
00:18:16,368 --> 00:18:19,632
Sita hears his cry for alms!

183
00:18:25,263 --> 00:18:28,527
The sage implores: "Give alms
in the name of God"

184
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:33,710
"God keep you well"

185
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,196
The sage insists: "Sita, step out of
the ring of fire. Hand me the offering"

186
00:18:59,403 --> 00:19:02,954
As Sita stepped out,
the sage turned into the demon Ravan

187
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:13,898
You sinner! O Lord Ram, save me!

188
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:23,209
Ladiesand gentlemen

189
00:19:23,594 --> 00:19:25,386
We are proud to welcome...

190
00:19:25,577 --> 00:19:28,648
...Maitri Devi, the councillor for Delhi 6

191
00:19:30,761 --> 00:19:32,873
The honourable lady is here

192
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,480
On behalf of the Ram Leela committee...

193
00:19:40,455 --> 00:19:43,241
...we'd like to garland her

194
00:19:46,982 --> 00:19:52,166
"May the rule of Ram reign forever.
I may die but I'll never break a promise!"

195
00:19:53,414 --> 00:19:58,374
Lord Ram who sacrificed
everything in the name of duty...

196
00:19:59,046 --> 00:20:01,349
...at His feet...

197
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:07,301
...I offer donation money
on behalf of my party and me

198
00:20:07,686 --> 00:20:08,933
Please accept it

199
00:20:12,389 --> 00:20:16,804
Join me when I say:
"Long live Ram and Sita!"

200
00:20:17,763 --> 00:20:20,547
Long live Lord Hanuman!

201
00:20:21,124 --> 00:20:22,276
Long live Maitri Devi!

202
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:32,899
In India, the gods dance
to the whims of politicians

203
00:20:35,106 --> 00:20:36,546
I thoroughly enjoyed the Ram Leela

204
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:40,866
But even more fascinating
were the people

205
00:20:42,114 --> 00:20:46,434
I was so exhausted.
But the real drama was yet to unfold

206
00:20:48,354 --> 00:20:54,017
Hanuman! Go and see.
Two men have entered the forest

207
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,064
Hanuman! Where are you?

208
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:10,303
Where has Lord Hanuman gone?

209
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,254
Hanumanji, it's your cue.
They're looking for you

210
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,606
A monkey!

211
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:26,622
The Black Monkey!

212
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:30,557
The Black Monkey!

213
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:55,290
You slow poke

214
00:21:55,483 --> 00:21:57,881
Manager! Come here

215
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:04,698
- Is he the one?
- No

216
00:22:06,394 --> 00:22:12,633
Balls of a wimp! It's not him either.
Aren't you an expert at grabbing tails?

217
00:22:13,305 --> 00:22:14,553
Carry on!

218
00:22:16,088 --> 00:22:17,432
Whose phone is that?

219
00:22:18,777 --> 00:22:20,601
Whose tail is ringing?

220
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,472
Yes? Hello!

221
00:22:29,527 --> 00:22:33,079
Inspector sir, the phone
belongs to Roshan

222
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:36,821
Roshan! I've found it
What species is he?

223
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:41,014
Sir, please let me go

224
00:22:41,207 --> 00:22:43,222
Did I give you permission to stop?

225
00:22:51,285 --> 00:22:52,436
Who's this?

226
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:55,028
Roshan, let's go

227
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,662
Shall I slap his left cheek too?

228
00:22:57,045 --> 00:22:58,101
Know who I am?

229
00:23:01,268 --> 00:23:02,613
You must be a public servant

230
00:23:05,205 --> 00:23:07,699
Balls of a wimp! Do I look like a servant?

231
00:23:18,227 --> 00:23:21,778
There maybe few highways,
but there's always a way out

232
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,200
Thank you, Inspector sir

233
00:23:35,216 --> 00:23:36,370
Mr Baig

234
00:23:37,713 --> 00:23:41,521
Tell him how the wind blows.
This is India

235
00:23:42,097 --> 00:23:44,496
You bow to a uniform. No choice

236
00:23:54,382 --> 00:23:55,439
What did you do?

237
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:58,991
I offered him a paan

238
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,503
Wrapped in a bank note

239
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,515
This is Delhi, my friend

240
00:24:36,395 --> 00:24:38,219
Offering you nothing
but love and affection

241
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,403
Delhi is a place for those who love life

242
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,538
A place where crazed lovers live

243
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,102
It holds you in a tight embrace

244
00:25:20,295 --> 00:25:22,887
It lets you hear its heartbeat

245
00:25:23,174 --> 00:25:25,190
Hearts to your left

246
00:25:25,286 --> 00:25:27,782
Hearts to your right

247
00:25:29,989 --> 00:25:32,294
This is not a city but a gathering of lovers

248
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,573
This is Delhi, my friend

249
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,324
Offering you nothing
but love and affection

250
00:25:51,267 --> 00:25:53,380
- Specs...
- Do I need them?

251
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:56,644
Why the toothpaste grin?

252
00:26:05,762 --> 00:26:10,465
Sunita, the scene today is:
Show some flesh, hide some

253
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:17,185
You want 4x6? 5x7? Laminated?
You've wasted my whole day

254
00:26:17,857 --> 00:26:21,569
I have beauty. I have heart.
Apretty face and I'm smart

255
00:26:24,352 --> 00:26:25,888
Apretty face and I'm smart

256
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:30,303
I, Bittu Sharma, will be your
new Indian Idol

257
00:26:31,264 --> 00:26:35,392
Loosen up! Relax.
Be a little sexy!

258
00:26:36,736 --> 00:26:41,823
Hey mister, watch your step.
Tread carefully on the path of love

259
00:26:47,102 --> 00:26:49,887
The path of love
is strewn with cheats

260
00:27:05,116 --> 00:27:07,900
Not bad! You forgot your lipstick today

261
00:27:08,764 --> 00:27:10,301
No, I didn't. It got rubbed off

262
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:12,125
When do my lips try that?

263
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,851
What?

264
00:27:14,045 --> 00:27:15,196
Your hair!

265
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,172
Your hands are too frisky.
Control them

266
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:21,339
They have a will of their own.
What a dirty mind!

267
00:27:21,627 --> 00:27:22,971
Maybe they want something

268
00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:25,146
Bittu, you never take me seriously

269
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:28,218
You'll appreciate me when
I make you an Indian Idol

270
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,322
Not a bad photographer.
You can cover my wedding

271
00:27:35,898 --> 00:27:38,201
They're in black and white. No colour

272
00:27:38,682 --> 00:27:42,233
- I see life in black and white
- But rainbows fill the Mumbai sky

273
00:27:45,017 --> 00:27:47,224
Models! Money

274
00:27:47,512 --> 00:27:48,954
I must make some money

275
00:27:49,241 --> 00:27:51,256
But to make money you need money

276
00:27:52,024 --> 00:27:53,176
Suresh!

277
00:27:57,272 --> 00:27:58,232
Lalaji!

278
00:27:59,191 --> 00:28:01,303
What a coincidence!
I was coming to see you

279
00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:03,511
Your meter is ticking, Suresh

280
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:06,294
You owe me 166,000 rupees

281
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:11,094
Didn't you get the cheque?
I'll clear our accounts at Diwali

282
00:28:12,631 --> 00:28:14,358
You have a week

283
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:18,102
Or else... I think you get it

284
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:21,748
Got it! You look smart today.
May I take a photo?

285
00:28:35,348 --> 00:28:36,211
Say "ah"

286
00:28:40,435 --> 00:28:41,491
Gran!

287
00:28:43,219 --> 00:28:46,771
Rama is gifted.
She'll brighten her in-laws' home

288
00:28:51,762 --> 00:28:54,163
Her brothers' quarrelling is
spoiling her chance of marriage

289
00:28:55,218 --> 00:28:56,178
Damn their bickering!

290
00:28:57,138 --> 00:28:58,481
Soon she'll be too old to marry

291
00:29:02,289 --> 00:29:05,168
Age has nothing to do with finding love

292
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,079
When my beloved teases me,
sister-in-law ribs me

293
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:27,056
My husband's house is as lovely
as a marigold

294
00:29:27,343 --> 00:29:31,279
When mother-in-law taunts me,
brother-in-law consoles me

295
00:29:31,663 --> 00:29:34,223
My husband's house is as lovely
as a marigold

296
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:39,022
I left my parents' home
so I could belong to my beloved

297
00:29:46,222 --> 00:29:50,157
My husband isa merchant.
He is leaving for the city

298
00:29:50,638 --> 00:29:55,052
When I see him go, my heart sinks

299
00:29:55,437 --> 00:29:57,644
My husband's house is as lovely
as a marigold

300
00:30:19,305 --> 00:30:24,970
I left my parent's home
so I could belong to my beloved

301
00:30:26,506 --> 00:30:30,441
Wearinga bush shirt,
he happily chews paan

302
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:35,433
There is no one to match him
in all of Raipur

303
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,088
My husband's house is as lovely
as a marigold

304
00:30:56,422 --> 00:30:59,013
I can't swallow a thing

305
00:31:01,222 --> 00:31:04,582
Eating too many betel nuts!
Who's there to stop you?

306
00:31:06,118 --> 00:31:07,078
Aren't you Rama?

307
00:31:10,213 --> 00:31:14,053
Wow! You've never met us.
But you recognize us

308
00:31:14,533 --> 00:31:16,164
The one and only Rajjo!

309
00:31:17,604 --> 00:31:20,196
How do you do? Is all well with you?

310
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:26,148
Your son is a gem

311
00:31:27,396 --> 00:31:29,123
He's one of us now

312
00:31:29,508 --> 00:31:32,867
We're keeping him.
Don't say we didn't warn you!

313
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,978
Keep him! He's yours anyway

314
00:31:35,266 --> 00:31:39,298
You have a Delhi-6 heart.
Tangy and spicy! Like a Delhi snack

315
00:31:40,225 --> 00:31:41,185
Mother!

316
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:44,450
Call 911!

317
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:53,568
We're going to the hospital

318
00:31:55,584 --> 00:31:57,121
Irwin Hospital!

319
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,497
Get out of the way!

320
00:32:02,977 --> 00:32:04,032
Mamdu!

321
00:32:04,513 --> 00:32:06,143
She's very unwell

322
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,543
What's wrong? Tie this to her wrist

323
00:32:13,023 --> 00:32:14,367
Lord Hanuman will cure her

324
00:32:15,327 --> 00:32:16,958
We won't let her fall sick

325
00:32:18,974 --> 00:32:20,511
Gobar, clear the way!

326
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,118
Why have they stopped?

327
00:32:27,998 --> 00:32:29,149
What's going on?

328
00:32:34,236 --> 00:32:35,485
Mother Cow is giving birth

329
00:32:37,116 --> 00:32:38,268
Mother Cow giving baby cow

330
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:40,669
Move them out of the way. Go on!

331
00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:43,357
Clear the road!

332
00:32:48,604 --> 00:32:51,867
You're blessed to see
Mother Cow giving birth

333
00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:54,075
Mother Cow is giving birth

334
00:32:54,459 --> 00:32:56,955
Those who witness the birth
are freed of all misfortune

335
00:32:57,242 --> 00:33:00,219
Here! Mother Cow has blessed you

336
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:04,538
Can prayer ever be stopped?

337
00:33:05,018 --> 00:33:07,130
Mother Cow is giving birth.
People have gathered

338
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:08,570
How can the police intervene?

339
00:33:11,352 --> 00:33:13,176
Step back! Everyone stand back!

340
00:33:15,385 --> 00:33:17,080
Gran?

341
00:33:17,945 --> 00:33:19,192
Move aside. Let us pass!

342
00:33:30,327 --> 00:33:32,056
Your Gran is better already

343
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,127
Mother Cow's miracle!

344
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:40,407
Her sugar level had dropped
and she fainted

345
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:42,039
She's fine now

346
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,150
Back in America, we thought
Gran had no one in Delhi

347
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:48,438
But everyone here is family

348
00:34:11,284 --> 00:34:12,820
Gran is dying, Ali Uncle

349
00:34:14,354 --> 00:34:15,603
The poet Zauq says:

350
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:17,043
"Who can ever wish to leave Delhi's lanes?"

351
00:34:17,236 --> 00:34:18,580
"Who can ever wish to leave Delhi's lanes?"

352
00:34:19,635 --> 00:34:21,331
Just stay

353
00:34:22,386 --> 00:34:24,499
Stay as you are

354
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,474
You are pain

355
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:28,913
You are comfort

356
00:34:36,498 --> 00:34:37,650
A gentle breeze

357
00:34:39,281 --> 00:34:41,393
A stormy obsession

358
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:47,152
Smooth as silk. Jagged as rough cloth

359
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:50,512
Sometimes you quarrel.
Sometimes you're stubborn

360
00:34:50,703 --> 00:34:52,976
So full of fragrance

361
00:34:53,263 --> 00:34:55,471
I don't want to change you an inch

362
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,015
Without adornment. Without impurity.
No more. No less

363
00:35:04,494 --> 00:35:06,990
I love you just as you are

364
00:35:09,486 --> 00:35:10,254
All yours

365
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:14,189
In your rainfall,
I want to dissolve

366
00:35:22,252 --> 00:35:25,773
In your flame,
I want to burn and turn to ash

367
00:35:32,011 --> 00:35:35,948
If you wound me,
soothe me with a balm

368
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:43,243
I will soon love the wound you inflict

369
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:56,746
You are a river. Let me drown in you

370
00:36:07,688 --> 00:36:10,087
Your father and I had a great time
when we were young

371
00:36:22,087 --> 00:36:25,063
No wife and children. A girl-friend?

372
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:28,199
Just the one

373
00:36:32,998 --> 00:36:34,342
Your father took her away

374
00:36:38,277 --> 00:36:39,141
My mother?

375
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:46,245
25 years ago, if I had told Fatima
"I love you"

376
00:36:47,397 --> 00:36:49,604
I might have a son like you today

377
00:36:51,811 --> 00:36:55,460
But dreams only blossomed
In my heart

378
00:36:56,228 --> 00:36:57,475
Your father had guts

379
00:36:57,667 --> 00:37:00,899
He loved her madly.
He fought everyone

380
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:05,027
Not caring what they said
about Fatima being a Muslim

381
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:07,522
He fought for love

382
00:37:08,482 --> 00:37:12,226
When I look at you,
I see that love

383
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:16,066
In your eyes and in the way you talk

384
00:37:18,657 --> 00:37:19,809
But then I know...

385
00:37:21,633 --> 00:37:23,074
...you will leave us too

386
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:25,089
Back to America

387
00:37:41,855 --> 00:37:43,103
My life is there

388
00:37:49,822 --> 00:37:55,102
All my pleas are written on my face

389
00:38:01,533 --> 00:38:03,996
What can I ask of You, O Master?

390
00:38:06,397 --> 00:38:10,044
You already know what is in my heart

391
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:19,452
O Master! My Master

392
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:44,665
Cracks blemish the line of my destiny

393
00:38:45,241 --> 00:38:47,833
Repair my fate, O Master

394
00:38:58,584 --> 00:39:05,207
Repair my fate, O Master

395
00:39:10,551 --> 00:39:14,967
He who comes to Your threshold
comes to bow his head

396
00:39:20,437 --> 00:39:24,949
He came with throat parched.
And found an overflowing river

397
00:39:26,388 --> 00:39:28,981
He returned bathed in the shower
of Your light

398
00:39:44,404 --> 00:39:49,972
The rich always buy the best urns.
501. 95 paisa. Just feel it

399
00:39:51,315 --> 00:39:54,867
Do you have a gold urn?
With gems and rubies

400
00:39:55,346 --> 00:39:57,074
Why show off in death?

401
00:39:57,362 --> 00:39:59,281
Why save if you're going forever?

402
00:40:00,242 --> 00:40:04,754
A copper urn. 251.95 paisa

403
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:07,921
I want a clay urn for my ashes.
Or I'm off

404
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:12,497
You're so old-fashioned. Here you are

405
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,856
Especially made from sacred Ganges clay

406
00:40:16,144 --> 00:40:19,312
- 151.95 paisa
- This is good

407
00:40:19,888 --> 00:40:21,615
Roshan, hold it

408
00:40:24,111 --> 00:40:26,127
Now I can die in peace

409
00:40:26,703 --> 00:40:28,432
Here you are

410
00:40:32,175 --> 00:40:32,943
Only 100?

411
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:34,575
Be happy

412
00:40:35,535 --> 00:40:38,319
"The tree said to the leaf:
Listen to what I say:

413
00:40:39,086 --> 00:40:41,965
"This is the cycle of life:
A leaf dies. Another is born"

414
00:40:44,621 --> 00:40:47,118
I first thought it odd that Gran
was making these arrangements

415
00:40:48,462 --> 00:40:49,037
A bit morbid

416
00:40:50,093 --> 00:40:53,165
Who goes shopping for your
own funeral? Discussing death like this

417
00:40:55,276 --> 00:40:57,484
I suppose we can't decide the manner
in which we are born

418
00:40:59,596 --> 00:41:02,475
But we can plan our departure

419
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:11,211
The rainy season is over. Autumn is here

420
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:23,849
Yet I have had no word of Sita

421
00:41:28,362 --> 00:41:32,009
It pains Laxman to see
His brother suffering

422
00:41:40,168 --> 00:41:43,335
He longs to take away his pain

423
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,343
Fresh attacks in Delhi 6

424
00:41:55,014 --> 00:41:57,415
The dark shadow of the Black Monkey
is cast all over Delhi

425
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:02,310
My heart stopped when I saw it.
It had bulbs on its chest

426
00:42:02,694 --> 00:42:06,150
When I touched it,
I got a 500 volt shock!

427
00:42:06,438 --> 00:42:07,206
Oh my God!

428
00:42:07,398 --> 00:42:10,277
The earth gets its energy from the sun

429
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:14,405
But the monster Black Monkey's energy
is far greater

430
00:42:14,885 --> 00:42:16,228
It can attack any time

431
00:42:16,709 --> 00:42:18,533
They're all fools

432
00:42:19,012 --> 00:42:19,940
The Black Monkey...

433
00:42:20,036 --> 00:42:21,188
It tore her saree...

434
00:42:25,124 --> 00:42:28,099
Do you want to be the next Indian Idol?

435
00:42:29,732 --> 00:42:32,419
The Indian Idol bus is coming
to your town!

436
00:42:44,707 --> 00:42:46,627
You pierced your navel?

437
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:49,121
Sexy, eh? I had it done yesterday

438
00:42:49,602 --> 00:42:53,217
- It must have hurt
- Nothing gained without pain

439
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:57,344
If the Black Monkey has glowing lights
on its chest...

440
00:42:57,633 --> 00:42:59,841
...it means it has a mother board

441
00:43:00,128 --> 00:43:02,529
An electrical circuit. Right?

442
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:05,792
Leave him alone

443
00:43:06,176 --> 00:43:07,520
Don't bore him with your theories

444
00:43:08,192 --> 00:43:11,359
Young man! What happens when
Water enters an electrical circuit?

445
00:43:13,663 --> 00:43:16,927
Right! Well done!
Hear that, Rajjo?

446
00:43:17,215 --> 00:43:18,558
He's smarter than us

447
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:21,150
Made in America! Right?

448
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:24,478
So, if you see the Black Monkey's
mother board, pour water on it

449
00:43:25,246 --> 00:43:27,262
Short circuit! Finished!

450
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:30,333
The end of the Black Monkey. Right?

451
00:43:32,925 --> 00:43:35,422
Brilliant. It's time to leave

452
00:43:36,093 --> 00:43:39,836
I'm not blowing my own trumpet.
But no one can touch me in electronics

453
00:43:40,316 --> 00:43:44,157
Only father's old radio is beyond me

454
00:43:44,828 --> 00:43:48,380
Until I hear a sound from it,
I won't give up

455
00:43:53,563 --> 00:43:54,524
I'll see you at the prayer meeting

456
00:43:57,658 --> 00:44:01,883
Good you're arranging a prayer meeting.
The Goddess will bless us

457
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:03,899
Hail to the Goddess!

458
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:11,194
Sister-in-law!

459
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:15,417
I don't know what he was telling Roshan

460
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:18,969
Something about the Black Monkey's mother
Sitting for a board exam

461
00:44:20,601 --> 00:44:22,042
Pour water on it

462
00:44:23,097 --> 00:44:25,112
He said pour water on it
and it's dead

463
00:44:27,224 --> 00:44:29,112
But where do we get
so much water?

464
00:44:30,551 --> 00:44:31,416
This chilli!

465
00:44:33,047 --> 00:44:34,391
- Let Bobby play with me
- Stop it!

466
00:45:01,237 --> 00:45:02,581
- What is it?
- Some sweets

467
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:04,500
Why? Has Mother Cow given birth?

468
00:45:05,557 --> 00:45:11,124
No! Granny is well again. So we're
organizing a prayer meeting

469
00:45:13,715 --> 00:45:15,923
I just came out of the toilet.
My handsare unwashed

470
00:45:17,555 --> 00:45:18,420
Leave it inside

471
00:45:46,609 --> 00:45:50,257
You're the wife of Madangopal Electrical.
How can you be so dumb?

472
00:45:51,024 --> 00:45:52,272
You're from America, right?

473
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:58,992
Lightning strikes when it rains?
Yes? It does. Right?

474
00:46:00,527 --> 00:46:02,351
Does lightning cause
the clouds to short-circuit?

475
00:46:04,622 --> 00:46:07,023
- Never heard such a thing
- Neither have I

476
00:46:07,503 --> 00:46:10,767
Throwing water on the Black Monkey
won't help

477
00:46:11,054 --> 00:46:12,206
Stop that damn racket!

478
00:46:14,413 --> 00:46:16,428
Do you think the Black Monkey
is a son of an ass?

479
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:18,543
A big hero!

480
00:46:18,926 --> 00:46:20,269
Talking rot to the women

481
00:46:20,558 --> 00:46:22,093
Uncle is right, father

482
00:46:22,478 --> 00:46:24,972
My science teacher told us
about short circuits

483
00:46:25,165 --> 00:46:29,868
Shut up! Son of an ass!
When you're my age, then talk big!

484
00:46:30,252 --> 00:46:33,419
- Must you shout in front of Roshan?
- Mummy, I'm going out

485
00:46:34,283 --> 00:46:38,188
Serve some lunch to Mrs. Mehra.
Then go to college

486
00:46:50,186 --> 00:46:51,626
Pour water on the monkey? Ha!

487
00:47:01,322 --> 00:47:03,049
You Americans think you own everything

488
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:05,545
You force your way everywhere.
Into any country

489
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:08,776
So shameless. You Americans
never ask for permission

490
00:47:11,848 --> 00:47:12,423
What's the big deal?

491
00:47:12,807 --> 00:47:15,784
It's a big deal for us.
We never cross the line

492
00:47:16,457 --> 00:47:17,320
You burger species!

493
00:47:24,135 --> 00:47:25,959
You know why the Black Monkey
wears shades?

494
00:47:26,246 --> 00:47:28,070
- How would I know?
- It's stylish, boss!

495
00:47:29,126 --> 00:47:31,334
You're smoking Indian cigarettes
when I'm around?

496
00:47:31,622 --> 00:47:34,021
Try this, sir. Imported

497
00:47:35,271 --> 00:47:36,422
Special filter

498
00:47:37,095 --> 00:47:38,151
Is that so?

499
00:47:39,654 --> 00:47:41,190
What a waste

500
00:47:41,381 --> 00:47:43,301
Bobby, come here

501
00:47:44,262 --> 00:47:48,293
Well, Mr Bobby? You'll get 90%
in your exams this time. Right?

502
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,980
No. 100%

503
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:52,420
Bravo!

504
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,917
Pulling your uncle's leg! Right?

505
00:47:55,396 --> 00:47:56,452
Who started this round?

506
00:47:58,467 --> 00:48:01,252
Ok! There's a beggar sitting
round the corner

507
00:48:01,924 --> 00:48:02,596
Give this to him

508
00:48:03,267 --> 00:48:04,419
That's my boy!

509
00:48:09,315 --> 00:48:11,490
- What are you doing?
- I'll do what I want

510
00:48:11,874 --> 00:48:13,122
Shall we go in?

511
00:48:15,331 --> 00:48:18,114
- Those damn ghosts live there
- Go on!

512
00:48:18,786 --> 00:48:21,282
You come too. Big mouth!

513
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:29,248
Don't be a kid. We're grown up now

514
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,416
- What if we're caught?
- No one enters Dead Souls' Lane

515
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:34,913
They say scary spirits roam here

516
00:48:35,104 --> 00:48:37,024
Mummy says cigarettes are bad

517
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,464
But your father smokes

518
00:48:38,848 --> 00:48:39,903
You coward!

519
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,208
- I'm no coward
- That's more like it!

520
00:48:42,304 --> 00:48:46,207
In Delhi 6, Jalebi helps boys
become men

521
00:48:46,592 --> 00:48:48,799
Jalebi? She's of a lower caste

522
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,718
- So what!
- I'll ask Mummy

523
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:54,175
You son of an ass! You can't ask
Mummy about everything

524
00:48:54,462 --> 00:48:55,423
Now we're men

525
00:49:04,925 --> 00:49:05,981
Sister! The garbage

526
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:12,797
Old letch!

527
00:49:23,516 --> 00:49:27,259
You girl thief! You'll be dancing like a peacock
when I shove my broom...

528
00:49:36,282 --> 00:49:37,242
The garbage!

529
00:49:46,169 --> 00:49:47,577
Mrs. Mehra, the flowers

530
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,264
Go in

531
00:49:55,929 --> 00:49:57,177
Simpleton!

532
00:50:06,968 --> 00:50:08,215
Turn us into men

533
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:11,000
Who told you I could do that?

534
00:50:11,478 --> 00:50:15,511
- Everyone knows
- Sonny, you still wet your pants

535
00:50:16,086 --> 00:50:18,006
Still drinking milk.
You'll be men?

536
00:50:20,086 --> 00:50:21,910
We're grown up. We want to be men

537
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:24,022
I'll call your mother

538
00:50:25,653 --> 00:50:27,382
Be men!

539
00:50:28,245 --> 00:50:29,494
Damn it!

540
00:50:30,549 --> 00:50:33,525
Wretched parents!
Spoiling their children

541
00:50:34,101 --> 00:50:35,349
The garbage!

542
00:50:40,628 --> 00:50:42,068
In the name of Lord Ram!

543
00:50:42,259 --> 00:50:42,932
Disaster!

544
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,467
What have you done?

545
00:50:51,636 --> 00:50:54,419
Pure of body. Pure of spirit

546
00:50:59,218 --> 00:51:01,906
- Take your clothes off
- You wish!

547
00:51:02,578 --> 00:51:06,033
So what if Jalebi is human!
She's of a lower caste

548
00:51:06,417 --> 00:51:07,952
You have to bathe. Come on

549
00:51:08,146 --> 00:51:11,313
Roshan, listen to him.
Do as I say, son

550
00:51:16,017 --> 00:51:19,281
Shabri, why do you hesitate?

551
00:51:21,296 --> 00:51:24,335
Give me a berry to eat

552
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:30,096
She tastes the berries and offers
the sweetest to Lord Ram

553
00:51:30,481 --> 00:51:34,990
Without hesitation,
Lord Ram eats berry after berry

554
00:51:37,582 --> 00:51:40,079
Shabri is of a lower caste. Why is
He eating berries she has tasted?

555
00:51:41,422 --> 00:51:45,934
To Lord Ram, one is inferior
or superior by birth

556
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:52,270
Ramji is God.
He is permitted everything

557
00:51:57,228 --> 00:51:58,957
Rambihari

558
00:51:59,437 --> 00:52:02,316
I need company. Bring Jalebi to me

559
00:52:11,148 --> 00:52:12,875
The boss wants you

560
00:52:16,235 --> 00:52:17,099
The key is here

561
00:52:17,291 --> 00:52:18,251
Come on

562
00:52:19,307 --> 00:52:22,474
You wretch! I'll fix you

563
00:52:23,146 --> 00:52:24,969
- Stand up!
- I'm not going with you

564
00:52:26,027 --> 00:52:27,147
Tell him that!

565
00:52:33,961 --> 00:52:34,825
The police!

566
00:52:41,448 --> 00:52:42,217
The Black Monkey?

567
00:52:47,784 --> 00:52:49,320
Hail to the Black Monkey!

568
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:24,421
Where did the balls of the wimp go?

569
00:53:28,452 --> 00:53:29,220
Who?

570
00:53:29,507 --> 00:53:33,220
The Black Monkey! Who else?
Not asking about your father

571
00:53:34,467 --> 00:53:36,196
Pass me the fog horn!

572
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:39,458
You Black Monkey

573
00:53:40,803 --> 00:53:44,354
Your game is up.
We have surrounded the place

574
00:53:44,931 --> 00:53:48,194
Be reasonable,
Or else we will shoot you

575
00:53:57,121 --> 00:54:00,480
- He tore through the roof
- He must have springs for feet

576
00:54:02,304 --> 00:54:04,961
You saw it?
What does it look like?

577
00:54:08,512 --> 00:54:10,816
Who?
- The Black Monkey! Who else?

578
00:54:11,008 --> 00:54:12,544
Why are you winding us up?

579
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,279
If he's invisible,
how can he be seen?

580
00:54:22,046 --> 00:54:23,871
The moron drives well too!

581
00:54:24,158 --> 00:54:25,982
Before I knew it...

582
00:54:26,943 --> 00:54:28,958
...I was adding
to the Black Monkey's saga

583
00:54:33,277 --> 00:54:35,166
Because of me, it is now invisible

584
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:47,836
In the dark of the night, wearing a dark suit
and dark glasses...

585
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:50,332
...the Black Monkey drives a black Sumo

586
00:54:50,524 --> 00:54:53,115
Once its dark deeds are done...

587
00:54:53,884 --> 00:54:54,939
...it presses a red button...

588
00:54:55,899 --> 00:54:56,955
And becomes invisible!

589
00:54:57,435 --> 00:54:58,203
It's an alien

590
00:54:58,299 --> 00:55:01,275
It attacked two girls in our area.
They were sleeping

591
00:55:01,563 --> 00:55:03,291
We gave chase. But it disappeared

592
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:05,403
This monkey is driving us crazy

593
00:55:07,482 --> 00:55:10,266
The albatross emits many sounds
while it is mating

594
00:55:18,521 --> 00:55:21,690
If you breathe deeply,
it'll benefit you in every way

595
00:55:24,089 --> 00:55:26,201
Great importance is given
in Yoga to breathing

596
00:55:35,223 --> 00:55:38,104
Many Sumo cars were destroyed
in Delhi

597
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:41,144
But this Sumo belonged
to the Black Monkey

598
00:55:41,432 --> 00:55:44,024
- Have you seen the Black Monkey?
- Yes! It's invisible

599
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:48,919
It is an animal.
Animals aren't in our jurisdiction

600
00:55:49,303 --> 00:55:50,262
Not a case for us

601
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:51,702
A monkey?

602
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:53,238
A criminal!

603
00:55:58,324 --> 00:56:00,438
Hurrah! The vehicle has lifted off!

604
00:56:01,878 --> 00:56:04,853
The monkey is an animal.
Not our jurisdiction!

605
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:06,772
So? Will you do nothing?

606
00:56:07,061 --> 00:56:08,885
Pointing fingers at us won't help

607
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:11,252
Look at our track record

608
00:56:11,924 --> 00:56:13,268
We are most capable

609
00:56:13,556 --> 00:56:14,228
Utter rot!

610
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:18,164
This case is for the Animal Ministry.
They must take action

611
00:56:18,931 --> 00:56:21,140
Move! Go home and watch TV

612
00:56:21,331 --> 00:56:24,116
Have you ever seen an animal
with a mother board?

613
00:56:24,788 --> 00:56:25,939
Springs for feet?

614
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:29,106
No! So how does it concern
the Animal Ministry?

615
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:32,563
Talk to the Science and
Technology Ministry

616
00:56:32,946 --> 00:56:36,881
If they stopped lining their pockets,
they'd have time for us

617
00:56:37,169 --> 00:56:38,321
How right you are!

618
00:56:39,283 --> 00:56:40,722
Madangopalji! It's from the shrine

619
00:56:40,913 --> 00:56:44,434
I'm Jaigopal!
For once get my name right

620
00:56:46,545 --> 00:56:48,752
Look! Look into the mirror

621
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,551
In every speck shines His light

622
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:57,008
Look within yourself,
He isn't far from you

623
00:56:57,295 --> 00:57:00,080
If you have love in you,
then embrace everyone

624
00:57:00,464 --> 00:57:01,904
That's true worship

625
00:57:02,383 --> 00:57:04,015
Look into the mirror!

626
00:57:06,031 --> 00:57:07,182
Salaams to you!

627
00:57:15,406 --> 00:57:17,133
He's a fine boy

628
00:57:17,422 --> 00:57:18,382
Haji Mian!

629
00:57:21,454 --> 00:57:24,333
Roshan slapped the Inspector last night

630
00:57:27,021 --> 00:57:28,173
"You public servant"

631
00:57:32,204 --> 00:57:33,837
"Do you know who I am?"

632
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:35,852
"You look like a public servant"

633
00:57:36,139 --> 00:57:38,347
"Servant? Do I look like a servant?"

634
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,036
Then our Roshan, tall as...

635
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:43,724
...the Qutub Minar, swung his arm...

636
00:57:57,227 --> 00:58:00,203
Did I give you permission to stop?
Carry on!

637
00:58:03,178 --> 00:58:04,329
I explained. "Roshan is new in town... "

638
00:58:05,577 --> 00:58:08,073
The Inspector can fix anyone

639
00:58:20,521 --> 00:58:21,384
Masakali! Come

640
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:30,886
Come here, my child

641
00:59:22,562 --> 00:59:24,770
Flap your wings. Fly away, Masakali!

642
00:59:38,976 --> 00:59:43,104
Spread your wings and set the dust free.
Fly high! And higher still

643
00:59:43,488 --> 00:59:45,695
Fly over cities, lanes and towns

644
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:52,031
Fly with grace on your wings.
Follow your heart's every desire

645
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:55,936
Blend with the wind. Stylish and swift.
Fly away, you gem

646
01:00:27,483 --> 01:00:31,899
A colony of clouds is your lovely abode

647
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:35,835
Turn your head away from
those who can't fly

648
01:00:39,194 --> 01:00:40,922
Fly! Do not be afraid

649
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:43,418
Do as you please. As you please

650
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:47,449
Fly away. Don't look back.
Smile as you spread your wings

651
01:01:11,032 --> 01:01:13,048
Flap your wings. Fly away, Masakali!

652
01:01:38,165 --> 01:01:42,581
What do you care about sorrow?
All you hear is the flute in the sky

653
01:01:42,868 --> 01:01:44,788
The wind talking

654
01:01:45,075 --> 01:01:47,284
The sun shining

655
01:01:48,147 --> 01:01:49,972
Fly away! Never fear

656
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,796
Do as you please. As you please

657
01:01:52,851 --> 01:01:54,675
Fly away. Don't look back

658
01:01:54,867 --> 01:01:56,499
Smile as you spread your wings, Masakali

659
01:02:51,341 --> 01:02:52,399
What's it to you?

660
01:02:54,606 --> 01:02:55,949
Bittu! My child

661
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:01,324
I'll pour it in his tea.
Then swallow some myself

662
01:03:02,381 --> 01:03:03,532
End of story

663
01:03:04,588 --> 01:03:06,956
- Whose tea?
- That bloated haystack!

664
01:03:07,532 --> 01:03:09,836
He wants to check me out. Marry me

665
01:03:10,221 --> 01:03:11,084
Check you out?

666
01:03:16,939 --> 01:03:18,859
You find us so amusing

667
01:03:24,138 --> 01:03:24,522
What's wrong?

668
01:03:25,193 --> 01:03:29,034
I don't want to get married.
But I don't have a choice

669
01:03:30,378 --> 01:03:33,450
I'll have to walk a little.
Sing a little.

670
01:03:34,122 --> 01:03:37,001
Pretend I cooked the samosas
Aunt Rama made. The perfect wife!

671
01:03:38,313 --> 01:03:40,329
Hurry! Papa is about to have a fit

672
01:03:44,839 --> 01:03:45,704
Yuck!

673
01:03:52,808 --> 01:03:56,743
If you don't want to get married,
tell them your point of view

674
01:03:59,047 --> 01:04:01,158
Who can dare talk to father?

675
01:04:05,861 --> 01:04:09,222
They're made for each other.
Like Ram and Sita!

676
01:04:10,534 --> 01:04:11,877
The princess arrives!

677
01:04:20,997 --> 01:04:22,821
May I have a word? It's urgent

678
01:04:23,973 --> 01:04:25,989
Not now. We have guests

679
01:04:28,964 --> 01:04:30,212
I said later!

680
01:04:32,323 --> 01:04:33,764
Do have something

681
01:04:45,251 --> 01:04:46,499
Bittu doesn't want to marry him

682
01:04:48,899 --> 01:04:50,914
You insolent boy!
Remember your place

683
01:04:57,249 --> 01:04:59,841
She can't tell you.
Because she's scared of you

684
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:04,256
I said get out!

685
01:05:08,192 --> 01:05:11,361
Bittu was going to drink rat poison.
And mix it in the tea

686
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,415
I am Sameer Abbas.
You're watching IBN-7

687
01:05:17,376 --> 01:05:19,006
Breaking news from Delhi 6

688
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:23,039
This is what the Black Monkey looks like

689
01:05:27,935 --> 01:05:30,814
The Delhi police offer a reward
of 50.000

690
01:05:36,574 --> 01:05:39,165
The Black Monkey is the latest rage

691
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:51,325
No doubt about it.
That's what it looks like

692
01:05:51,804 --> 01:05:53,915
Delhi is gripped by fear

693
01:05:54,109 --> 01:05:57,084
People are so scared

694
01:06:06,875 --> 01:06:09,179
Breaking news from Old Delhi!

695
01:06:09,370 --> 01:06:13,210
In Delhi 6, pregnant woman fell
to her death as she ran down the stairs

696
01:06:13,498 --> 01:06:18,361
She panicked when she heard people
say the Black Monkey was back

697
01:06:19,129 --> 01:06:22,009
Fear of the Black Monkey
has caused another death

698
01:06:22,586 --> 01:06:24,217
What is the Black Monkey?

699
01:06:24,889 --> 01:06:26,713
Everyone in Delhi fears it

700
01:06:27,001 --> 01:06:29,209
Is it some sort of plot?

701
01:06:29,784 --> 01:06:31,513
Hey! The Black Monkey!

702
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,049
Is it inside? Or is it out?

703
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:29,589
- How are you, Gobar?
- Very well

704
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:31,123
Long live the Goddess!

705
01:08:39,852 --> 01:08:40,906
Don't worry. I won't come in

706
01:08:43,591 --> 01:08:47,236
Offer flowers to the Goddess from me.
My wishes will come true

707
01:08:47,907 --> 01:08:49,059
No Hell for me

708
01:08:54,812 --> 01:09:00,568
Sita was born to destroy
Ravan's arrogance

709
01:09:01,815 --> 01:09:06,130
Praise the Goddess. Long live!

710
01:09:10,542 --> 01:09:15,146
When we light the lamp in Your temple...

711
01:09:18,023 --> 01:09:20,229
...our sins are washed away

712
01:09:20,421 --> 01:09:22,723
You shower us with happiness

713
01:10:11,731 --> 01:10:13,842
Hail to Goddess Durga!

714
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:21,130
Oh God! It's 8 o'clock

715
01:10:21,993 --> 01:10:25,255
The power cut is always on time.
That's for sure

716
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:35,806
You deserve a thank you

717
01:10:39,354 --> 01:10:40,697
So you're thanking me

718
01:10:40,985 --> 01:10:42,135
Something like that

719
01:10:49,424 --> 01:10:50,862
Did you really mean to
swallow rat poison?

720
01:10:51,534 --> 01:10:54,987
You're a bit slow. It was an act.
To scare mother

721
01:11:00,934 --> 01:11:06,400
When we light the lamp in Your temple...

722
01:11:10,237 --> 01:11:12,634
...our sins are washed away

723
01:11:14,839 --> 01:11:17,526
You shower us with happiness

724
01:11:31,144 --> 01:11:33,159
That's why I'll be the next Indian Idol

725
01:11:36,323 --> 01:11:41,791
The only way a middle-class girl can
become somebody from nobody

726
01:11:43,996 --> 01:11:46,012
I want to do something. Be someone

727
01:11:46,779 --> 01:11:48,025
Find myself

728
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:50,903
I don't want to be the Mrs. of
Daddy's chosen boy

729
01:11:51,764 --> 01:11:52,725
Understand?

730
01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:03,754
Enough talking!

731
01:12:05,288 --> 01:12:06,248
You burger species!

732
01:12:19,964 --> 01:12:24,374
My heart...

733
01:13:02,259 --> 01:13:03,409
My heart...

734
01:13:04,753 --> 01:13:07,247
...was lost to me

735
01:13:08,397 --> 01:13:10,603
Without warning

736
01:13:12,424 --> 01:13:14,630
But my eyes...

737
01:13:16,932 --> 01:13:18,562
...are all-seeing

738
01:13:19,713 --> 01:13:23,742
In the deep silence...

739
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:28,153
...of your flowing dark hair

740
01:13:29,209 --> 01:13:31,608
Is the place...

741
01:13:32,855 --> 01:13:34,292
...where my heart...

742
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:40,429
...found itself confused, lost

743
01:13:42,348 --> 01:13:45,322
Mesmerized... how unaware you are

744
01:13:46,377 --> 01:13:48,966
Unsuspectingly, unknowing

745
01:14:01,051 --> 01:14:05,271
Why does my heart quicken?

746
01:14:06,326 --> 01:14:09,875
But my eyes are all-seeing

747
01:14:48,047 --> 01:14:51,978
Pearls over brimming
from the lips of oysters

748
01:14:57,062 --> 01:15:00,513
Prose laced with poetry

749
01:15:05,405 --> 01:15:07,995
Sheltered under a sheet of waves...

750
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:16,052
...the ocean slumbers

751
01:15:18,929 --> 01:15:22,478
My eyes have been opened wide...

752
01:15:23,342 --> 01:15:26,026
...by a flood of drunkenness

753
01:15:37,151 --> 01:15:40,028
How unaware you are

754
01:16:29,998 --> 01:16:31,435
Look! The Taj Mahal!

755
01:16:33,258 --> 01:16:39,013
The Taj Mahal is a symbol to love.
Making mockery of the love of the poor

756
01:16:41,315 --> 01:16:44,576
"Beloved, let us meet
in some other place"

757
01:16:44,864 --> 01:16:46,783
Nice! Let's go in

758
01:17:29,941 --> 01:17:30,900
Roshan!

759
01:17:35,216 --> 01:17:36,079
Bittu!

760
01:18:07,728 --> 01:18:10,318
Ripping us off. Taking us for tourists?
I am a local

761
01:18:10,797 --> 01:18:13,004
We buy them for 95. I sell for 100

762
01:18:13,867 --> 01:18:15,018
I have to earn at least 5 rupees

763
01:18:15,210 --> 01:18:17,128
I can buy it for 20 in Chandni Chowk

764
01:18:17,416 --> 01:18:18,950
Then buy it there, sister

765
01:18:19,143 --> 01:18:20,773
Ok. Let's go

766
01:18:21,348 --> 01:18:23,266
Come back!

767
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:27,295
Last price. 75.
Because you're a local

768
01:18:29,789 --> 01:18:30,845
Take it. And be quiet

769
01:18:32,185 --> 01:18:33,050
What colour?

770
01:18:34,296 --> 01:18:35,063
For you

771
01:18:36,406 --> 01:18:40,146
I said 75! And you give me 50.
Pay at least 60!

772
01:18:40,721 --> 01:18:43,119
Madam, don't rob a poor shopkeeper

773
01:18:46,476 --> 01:18:47,627
That's more like it

774
01:18:50,985 --> 01:18:53,095
Roshan's photos of America

775
01:18:57,506 --> 01:18:58,752
Let me see too!

776
01:19:02,781 --> 01:19:07,193
Roshan! In America, you'll soon be
Looking at photos of us

777
01:19:35,294 --> 01:19:38,939
The dawn has broken. I wait for you

778
01:19:50,448 --> 01:19:53,900
My eyes are heavy.
Where did you spend the night?

779
01:20:10,109 --> 01:20:13,081
How fortunate is the other woman

780
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:16,919
The dawn has broken. I wait for you

781
01:20:23,154 --> 01:20:26,606
Your words are all I have

782
01:20:37,058 --> 01:20:38,018
Ok

783
01:20:39,169 --> 01:20:40,225
Just ok?

784
01:20:47,322 --> 01:20:50,871
Bittu. Life is full of highs and lows

785
01:20:54,419 --> 01:20:55,955
I've been selected

786
01:21:04,970 --> 01:21:05,928
I don't know

787
01:21:10,436 --> 01:21:12,642
You got what you always wanted. Right?

788
01:21:28,082 --> 01:21:29,330
Her wingsare tied

789
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:30,577
She can't fly

790
01:21:31,825 --> 01:21:33,264
Masakali is father's favourite.
That's why

791
01:21:37,004 --> 01:21:37,963
Shall I free her?

792
01:21:42,279 --> 01:21:44,005
Wasn't one slap from father
enough for you?

793
01:21:54,554 --> 01:21:56,953
How dare you question your father!

794
01:21:59,733 --> 01:22:00,789
I don't want to marry

795
01:22:01,651 --> 01:22:02,612
Then what do you want?

796
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:04,145
I want to be an Indian Idol

797
01:22:06,927 --> 01:22:07,790
What? Indian...

798
01:22:07,983 --> 01:22:10,957
Sister wants to be on TV.
The song and dance show

799
01:22:12,107 --> 01:22:13,736
That blasted TV!

800
01:22:14,503 --> 01:22:16,421
They sent me a ticket.
I'm going to Mumbai

801
01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:20,930
- Have you lost your mind?
- Get her married at once!

802
01:22:23,422 --> 01:22:24,957
Nothing but bad luck

803
01:22:26,492 --> 01:22:29,369
The girls in this family of ours
are so ill-fated

804
01:22:40,878 --> 01:22:43,084
You only think of yourself

805
01:22:45,099 --> 01:22:46,345
Oh God! Why?

806
01:22:46,633 --> 01:22:49,511
What else can I do?
Spend my life stuck here like you?

807
01:22:52,771 --> 01:22:54,018
I'm sorry, Aunt Rama

808
01:22:58,142 --> 01:23:00,253
The stock market has opened robustly

809
01:23:00,444 --> 01:23:03,609
Sharesare up. There's brisk trading

810
01:23:06,965 --> 01:23:07,829
Their horoscopes don't match

811
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:10,131
Your shares are up. Do we sell?

812
01:23:10,419 --> 01:23:11,954
She has bad planets

813
01:23:18,954 --> 01:23:20,297
A token of good will

814
01:23:22,504 --> 01:23:24,806
We're giving the boy a Honda

815
01:23:27,010 --> 01:23:29,024
My boy can't be bought
for a bike

816
01:23:30,079 --> 01:23:33,916
What are you saying?
You thought I meant a motorbike?

817
01:23:35,834 --> 01:23:38,711
I meant a Honda car.
You choose the colour

818
01:23:42,451 --> 01:23:43,602
Sell or wait?

819
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:47,536
And a Singapore honeymoon on us. Sell!

820
01:23:48,495 --> 01:23:49,070
What?

821
01:23:55,112 --> 01:23:58,277
I am Priyanka Sambhav and
you're watching "The Last Deal"

822
01:23:58,756 --> 01:24:01,155
Panditji. Name an auspicious day

823
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:09,595
Joy abounds! A match made in heaven.
No better day then Diwali

824
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:13,335
Is it a done deal?

825
01:24:17,459 --> 01:24:18,609
Done

826
01:24:19,185 --> 01:24:20,047
Congratulations!

827
01:24:21,294 --> 01:24:23,405
Order sweets to celebrate

828
01:24:26,761 --> 01:24:28,968
Bittu's wedding is fixed

829
01:24:30,407 --> 01:24:35,586
- Rajjo, see how lovely she looks
- A tip-top princess!

830
01:24:36,449 --> 01:24:40,190
How time flies. Now she's of age
to marry and leave home

831
01:24:45,272 --> 01:24:47,094
Keep your father's honour

832
01:25:24,307 --> 01:25:25,747
The Black Monkey has struck again

833
01:25:25,938 --> 01:25:28,911
It has taken 20 kgs. of milk.
12 kgs. of sweets

834
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:31,404
- How much cottage cheese?
- 15 kgs

835
01:25:32,746 --> 01:25:36,776
Move it! What are you doing?
It took Hina, the poor goat

836
01:25:37,927 --> 01:25:40,229
- Where were the police?
- At the police station!

837
01:25:40,611 --> 01:25:41,955
How did we know it will attack?

838
01:25:42,530 --> 01:25:44,162
What will you do now?

839
01:25:45,503 --> 01:25:50,108
Everything is under control.
See for yourself. Talk to Mamdu

840
01:25:50,396 --> 01:25:53,177
Let's talk to the shopkeeper whose
shop was attacked

841
01:25:53,369 --> 01:25:55,190
Mamdu, how do you feel?

842
01:25:55,958 --> 01:25:58,259
Let him talk to Mamdu!

843
01:25:59,219 --> 01:26:02,192
The damn Black Monkey is in our area

844
01:26:02,479 --> 01:26:06,124
And the police claim
they're controlling the situation

845
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:11,207
Today it's Hina, the goat. Tomorrow
it might our women. There's no telling

846
01:26:11,878 --> 01:26:14,948
Lalaji! Do you think we're twiddling
our thumbs?

847
01:26:15,427 --> 01:26:17,730
We'll take action too. Right?

848
01:26:19,742 --> 01:26:21,086
Long live Shani Baba!

849
01:26:33,170 --> 01:26:36,336
Shani Baba will fix everything. Ok?

850
01:26:41,803 --> 01:26:43,913
Side by side? Bad omen

851
01:26:48,804 --> 01:26:49,379
Really?

852
01:26:50,434 --> 01:26:51,298
When?

853
01:26:52,352 --> 01:26:53,120
Then?

854
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:54,654
I get it!

855
01:26:56,573 --> 01:26:58,778
Shani Baba will fix everything. Ok!

856
01:26:59,450 --> 01:27:00,696
How is it ok?

857
01:27:02,232 --> 01:27:03,287
Look!

858
01:27:06,069 --> 01:27:07,123
Lmages

859
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:08,753
Listen!

860
01:27:10,192 --> 01:27:14,123
Like songs on the radio. Images on TV

861
01:27:14,890 --> 01:27:16,713
They float in the air

862
01:27:17,768 --> 01:27:20,357
Only one antenna can capture them

863
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:28,798
In the same way, monkeys' souls
float about in the universe

864
01:27:29,853 --> 01:27:32,155
Only Shani Baba can communicate
with them

865
01:27:33,402 --> 01:27:35,799
Lord Hanuman has granted
this power to Shani Baba!

866
01:27:36,661 --> 01:27:39,635
- Lord Hanuman!
- May He live long!

867
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:46,350
I get it!

868
01:27:48,363 --> 01:27:50,186
What? Is that the truth?

869
01:27:53,926 --> 01:27:55,749
Baba will fix everything. Ok!

870
01:27:58,146 --> 01:27:59,967
Three hundred and seventeen years ago...

871
01:28:00,447 --> 01:28:02,173
...a temple stood here

872
01:28:03,037 --> 01:28:04,092
What are you saying?

873
01:28:05,147 --> 01:28:07,066
Baba will fix everything. Ok?

874
01:28:07,353 --> 01:28:10,039
Acurse! Aterrible curse

875
01:28:13,395 --> 01:28:14,259
Listen...

876
01:28:14,738 --> 01:28:19,823
The Black Monkey is the latest Hindu plot
to humiliate us Muslims

877
01:28:21,836 --> 01:28:26,535
The Black Monkey is creating mayhem.
It has wounded people

878
01:28:26,823 --> 01:28:28,166
And you call it a plot?

879
01:28:29,795 --> 01:28:34,687
Why does the Black Monkey only appear
from Muslim neighbourhoods?

880
01:28:35,647 --> 01:28:36,893
What do you mean, Madangopalji?

881
01:28:37,659 --> 01:28:40,921
Haji Mian! Why are Hindu areas
the only ones attacked?

882
01:28:41,114 --> 01:28:42,552
And during the Ram Leela performances?

883
01:28:43,703 --> 01:28:47,634
Hina wasa Muslim goat!
I mean she belonged to a Muslim

884
01:28:49,456 --> 01:28:52,334
But everyone knows Mamdu
prays to Lord Hanuman

885
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:54,636
So wouldn't the Black Monkey know?

886
01:28:55,213 --> 01:28:58,090
The Black Monkey can't be a Muslim

887
01:28:58,761 --> 01:29:00,199
We have 100% proof

888
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:07,776
Has anyone ever seen
a circumcised monkey?

889
01:29:08,448 --> 01:29:10,366
I have heard of people
behaving like monkeys

890
01:29:11,421 --> 01:29:12,954
But a monkey being Hindu or Muslim?

891
01:29:14,488 --> 01:29:16,504
This is India, my boy! Play

892
01:29:25,136 --> 01:29:26,958
I want a strand of
the Black Monkey's hair

893
01:29:27,821 --> 01:29:29,452
The Black Monkey's hair!

894
01:29:29,643 --> 01:29:30,604
The Black Monkey's hair?

895
01:29:30,987 --> 01:29:33,001
You mean pulling it off its body?

896
01:29:33,768 --> 01:29:34,727
Who will do that?

897
01:29:35,399 --> 01:29:36,356
We will!

898
01:29:36,549 --> 01:29:37,508
Shut up!

899
01:29:37,987 --> 01:29:41,440
Bring me its hair! I will destroy it!

900
01:29:42,494 --> 01:29:43,454
End of the menace

901
01:29:43,838 --> 01:29:45,085
End of the menace, ok!

902
01:29:45,468 --> 01:29:46,907
It'll be destroyed!

903
01:29:47,962 --> 01:29:49,592
Destroyed! Ok

904
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:52,374
Gobar will get the hair

905
01:29:54,964 --> 01:29:57,362
Brave Gobar!

906
01:29:58,417 --> 01:30:00,431
Why Gobar? Because he's an orphan?

907
01:30:00,622 --> 01:30:02,252
Let the fool be of some use

908
01:30:02,636 --> 01:30:04,746
He's smarter than you lot

909
01:30:06,377 --> 01:30:07,335
Miss Know-All

910
01:30:07,816 --> 01:30:10,309
Gobar, come here

911
01:30:14,337 --> 01:30:17,886
Want one ten-rupee note?
Or two one-rupee coins?

912
01:30:19,421 --> 01:30:21,818
Why one note? I'll take two coins

913
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,228
That's why he's the local idiot!

914
01:30:31,121 --> 01:30:34,766
The day I take the ten-rupee note,
the game is all over

915
01:30:38,794 --> 01:30:41,192
Look at the low caste
sniggering at us

916
01:30:44,165 --> 01:30:47,523
So what if I belong to
a lower caste?

917
01:30:48,865 --> 01:30:50,016
I'm better than you

918
01:30:50,112 --> 01:30:53,851
When you come to me at night,
no problem touching me, eh?

919
01:30:54,139 --> 01:30:55,866
But in the daytime,
I am "low caste" again!

920
01:30:56,058 --> 01:30:59,031
Speak up! Is a pacifier
blocking your tongue? Bastard!

921
01:31:01,619 --> 01:31:03,251
I'll put a pacifier in your mouth

922
01:31:04,976 --> 01:31:06,031
What did you say?

923
01:31:07,375 --> 01:31:10,637
The monkey makes you pee in your pants.
But you can hit a woman. Big man!

924
01:31:11,788 --> 01:31:14,377
Balls of a wimp!
Chasing skirt all day long

925
01:31:14,951 --> 01:31:15,911
Get lost!

926
01:31:17,349 --> 01:31:20,706
- Brave Gobar!
- May he live long!

927
01:31:22,050 --> 01:31:23,871
To get rid of an ordinary monkey...

928
01:31:24,064 --> 01:31:25,790
...prayers are being offered

929
01:31:26,076 --> 01:31:27,899
Illiteracy may be the reason

930
01:31:28,955 --> 01:31:30,777
We will hang the monkey and burn it

931
01:31:32,887 --> 01:31:34,613
The government does nothing
but chase votes

932
01:31:36,628 --> 01:31:37,586
We'll kill it!

933
01:31:47,945 --> 01:31:48,904
Never was there a temple here

934
01:31:49,767 --> 01:31:52,260
Nor will there ever be one

935
01:31:53,027 --> 01:31:54,274
Their ancestors destroyed the temple

936
01:31:54,658 --> 01:31:56,097
They'll have to pay the price

937
01:31:56,481 --> 01:31:57,632
All politics!

938
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:59,934
Lord Hanuman's name
is being disgraced

939
01:32:00,413 --> 01:32:01,949
The monkey is a Muslim terrorist

940
01:32:02,139 --> 01:32:04,537
We'll retaliate

941
01:32:07,029 --> 01:32:08,852
If you're stubborn...

942
01:32:09,236 --> 01:32:10,674
...you'll invite trouble. Right?

943
01:32:10,962 --> 01:32:12,689
How much more can we tolerate?

944
01:32:13,553 --> 01:32:15,374
Great tension in Chandni Chowk

945
01:32:16,237 --> 01:32:17,580
Push rites and rituals aside

946
01:32:17,772 --> 01:32:19,402
Look inside your homes

947
01:32:19,786 --> 01:32:21,608
Perhaps in some dark corner

948
01:32:21,897 --> 01:32:23,431
The Black Monkey lurks

949
01:32:23,718 --> 01:32:25,445
See the life in these lanes

950
01:32:25,638 --> 01:32:27,556
Hiding behind layers and layers

951
01:32:29,665 --> 01:32:31,487
Cloaks concealing cloaks

952
01:32:31,678 --> 01:32:33,501
Somewhere in the folds of the cloak

953
01:32:33,693 --> 01:32:36,475
Pain is veiled. Wounds are hidden

954
01:32:37,626 --> 01:32:39,447
Secrets are trampled under foot

955
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:41,463
Aware yet how unaware we are

956
01:32:41,654 --> 01:32:43,476
Mad and innocent we are

957
01:32:45,586 --> 01:32:47,408
Who knows the colour we're painted in

958
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,518
In the public bath,
we are naked. Exposed

959
01:32:50,094 --> 01:32:51,724
We've no orders from above

960
01:33:42,077 --> 01:33:42,939
Mamdu!

961
01:33:46,584 --> 01:33:48,406
Close the door! Hurry!

962
01:33:49,078 --> 01:33:49,941
Jaigopal! Damn you

963
01:33:58,285 --> 01:33:59,724
Some sweets for you

964
01:34:04,135 --> 01:34:05,862
You used to say:
"Mamdu's shop is my shop"

965
01:34:06,054 --> 01:34:07,109
Your shop! Like hell

966
01:34:10,848 --> 01:34:11,808
Your shop! Like hell

967
01:34:14,398 --> 01:34:16,987
Jaigopal! You spent half your life
at my shop

968
01:34:36,648 --> 01:34:39,334
Jaigopal believed my shop was his

969
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:44,226
They spent half their lives at my shop

970
01:34:56,981 --> 01:35:00,434
The police are offering a reward.
50,000 to catch the Black Monkey!

971
01:35:03,407 --> 01:35:04,654
Fifty-thousand?

972
01:35:05,422 --> 01:35:07,915
Catch the monkey.
And give the money to Lala

973
01:35:08,394 --> 01:35:11,751
- That's how much he paid for me
- My angel-face!

974
01:35:12,422 --> 01:35:15,012
I'll come with an army of monkeys for you

975
01:35:15,779 --> 01:35:16,644
Shashi!

976
01:35:22,877 --> 01:35:23,931
The Black Monkey!

977
01:35:24,411 --> 01:35:26,713
Lalalji! Save me

978
01:35:31,987 --> 01:35:33,043
The Black Monkey! Save me

979
01:35:36,784 --> 01:35:38,031
The Black Monkey!

980
01:35:42,635 --> 01:35:43,785
Where is the Black Monkey?

981
01:35:46,854 --> 01:35:47,813
Catch the Black Monkey!

982
01:36:01,911 --> 01:36:03,350
You foreigner!

983
01:36:04,118 --> 01:36:07,475
Is it still 8 foot? Or is it taller now?

984
01:36:08,818 --> 01:36:11,790
Springs under its feet? Vanished, eh?

985
01:36:13,133 --> 01:36:14,475
Into thin air?

986
01:36:16,970 --> 01:36:18,793
Don't glare at me!

987
01:36:19,944 --> 01:36:23,395
Lalaji's wife was almost raped.
You understand?

988
01:36:31,645 --> 01:36:32,891
Tell me...

989
01:36:33,946 --> 01:36:38,357
Whenever the Black Monkey attacks,
you're right there

990
01:36:38,932 --> 01:36:40,084
What's going on?

991
01:36:49,004 --> 01:36:53,223
- What did he say?
- Showing off his English

992
01:36:54,567 --> 01:36:55,718
Look at his arrogance!

993
01:36:56,006 --> 01:36:58,019
I'll sort him out

994
01:36:58,882 --> 01:36:59,650
Bless you, son!

995
01:37:04,924 --> 01:37:05,978
Rama...

996
01:37:10,103 --> 01:37:14,131
Have a laddo. Go on!
Bittu is getting married

997
01:37:14,803 --> 01:37:15,666
Rama, sweeten his mouth

998
01:37:15,761 --> 01:37:18,831
They say if you bathe in the Ganges
you're blessed once

999
01:37:19,599 --> 01:37:21,901
And a hundred times if you help
the family of a girl who is marrying

1000
01:37:38,588 --> 01:37:39,643
Why don't you just tell your father?

1001
01:37:40,123 --> 01:37:41,850
A father's honour is in
his daughter's hands

1002
01:37:44,727 --> 01:37:46,453
You're talking about your whole life

1003
01:37:47,412 --> 01:37:49,713
Fool? Do I look like a fool to you?

1004
01:37:52,398 --> 01:37:56,236
Forget it. You won't understand.
But Suresh does

1005
01:37:57,482 --> 01:37:58,442
I'm going to Mumbai with him

1006
01:38:01,895 --> 01:38:03,908
Yes! But he cares about my dreams

1007
01:38:04,579 --> 01:38:06,211
Is this how you'll find yourself?

1008
01:38:07,745 --> 01:38:10,143
I thought you'd put up a fight.
But you're running away

1009
01:38:11,774 --> 01:38:13,021
Am I your concern?

1010
01:38:21,939 --> 01:38:24,720
Do whatever you want.
You want to run from home?

1011
01:38:31,242 --> 01:38:34,696
Bastard! Leading my daughter astray?

1012
01:38:36,614 --> 01:38:37,957
Take her downstairs!

1013
01:38:38,531 --> 01:38:41,312
His family specializes
in eloping with girls

1014
01:38:41,887 --> 01:38:44,574
- Following your father's example, eh?
- Be quiet!

1015
01:38:45,149 --> 01:38:46,013
Mr. Fifty-Fifty!

1016
01:38:46,396 --> 01:38:49,273
Go, before I lose my head. Out!

1017
01:38:50,041 --> 01:38:50,905
What are you waiting for?

1018
01:38:56,850 --> 01:38:58,385
- What's wrong, Roshan?
- Nothing

1019
01:38:58,673 --> 01:38:59,728
Something has happened

1020
01:39:00,399 --> 01:39:03,275
Don't worry, son.
Leave everything to God

1021
01:39:08,838 --> 01:39:11,812
Which God? Whose God?

1022
01:39:12,484 --> 01:39:15,745
Leave it to mother's Allah?
Or Dad's Lord Ram?

1023
01:39:18,046 --> 01:39:20,444
Paint a stone red and it becomes a god

1024
01:39:21,115 --> 01:39:22,842
This plant of yours is a god too

1025
01:39:24,281 --> 01:39:28,308
But never solve your problems yourself.
Pray five timesa day

1026
01:39:28,693 --> 01:39:31,377
Ring a bell in a temple.
And leave everything to God

1027
01:39:31,569 --> 01:39:33,295
We want to do nothing ourselves

1028
01:39:36,748 --> 01:39:40,297
Don't say that. It's our faith

1029
01:39:47,491 --> 01:39:51,327
Whatever! But we're going back
to America

1030
01:39:51,997 --> 01:39:53,532
Then why did you bring me here?

1031
01:39:59,767 --> 01:40:02,069
Will you abandon your family in America
for these people?

1032
01:40:03,123 --> 01:40:06,289
My ashes will leave this place

1033
01:40:46,475 --> 01:40:47,721
What's going on, Gran?

1034
01:40:52,804 --> 01:40:54,339
I don't understand

1035
01:41:01,916 --> 01:41:03,643
Everything will be all right

1036
01:41:06,711 --> 01:41:07,670
Don't worry

1037
01:41:10,644 --> 01:41:11,699
This is a fight for our rights

1038
01:41:11,986 --> 01:41:13,233
A fight for our self-respect

1039
01:41:13,426 --> 01:41:14,576
A fight for our self-respect

1040
01:41:14,864 --> 01:41:16,877
A fight for our honour!

1041
01:41:19,851 --> 01:41:21,673
We'll worship Goddess Durga here!

1042
01:41:23,976 --> 01:41:25,030
We'll build a temple

1043
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:28,674
Say it loud and clear!
We will build a temple here

1044
01:41:28,866 --> 01:41:30,496
Fight in the name of God

1045
01:41:32,701 --> 01:41:33,757
They're provoking us

1046
01:41:34,141 --> 01:41:35,963
We die. Or they die

1047
01:41:36,827 --> 01:41:37,882
Sorry, Annapurnaji

1048
01:41:39,033 --> 01:41:41,622
He isn't allowed inside the temple

1049
01:41:42,677 --> 01:41:43,349
Meaning?

1050
01:41:43,924 --> 01:41:45,650
Blood is blood after all

1051
01:41:45,842 --> 01:41:49,870
- Let it go
- This temple doesn't belong to you

1052
01:41:50,446 --> 01:41:52,557
Does it belong to your father?
You Muslim!

1053
01:41:55,913 --> 01:41:59,366
Anyone who challenges us will be
destroyed!

1054
01:42:14,711 --> 01:42:17,493
You're better off listening to your elders

1055
01:42:18,739 --> 01:42:21,328
This is no party. Too much tension here

1056
01:42:22,863 --> 01:42:25,070
Granny! Make him see some sense

1057
01:42:25,932 --> 01:42:26,987
He doesn't get it

1058
01:42:32,550 --> 01:42:33,893
Have you ever wondered...

1059
01:42:36,962 --> 01:42:38,113
...what this good soul...

1060
01:42:39,072 --> 01:42:40,991
...whom you call a madman
is trying to say?

1061
01:42:41,182 --> 01:42:42,813
What can a mad fakir say?

1062
01:42:43,004 --> 01:42:45,976
Why don't you go ahead and tell us?

1063
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:52,307
"In every speck shines His divine light

1064
01:42:54,034 --> 01:42:56,719
"Look within yourself.
He isn't far from you"

1065
01:42:59,117 --> 01:43:02,570
He says everyone has
God's light within him

1066
01:43:03,816 --> 01:43:04,777
A speck of Him

1067
01:43:05,928 --> 01:43:06,982
If we look within...

1068
01:43:07,845 --> 01:43:08,804
...we will find Him

1069
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:13,216
Have you ever heard that
God hates anyone?

1070
01:43:16,093 --> 01:43:16,956
I haven't

1071
01:43:19,929 --> 01:43:22,423
The boy has acquired a taste
for preaching. Listen to him!

1072
01:43:32,877 --> 01:43:33,836
Have a look

1073
01:43:35,849 --> 01:43:37,000
Look! Madangopalji

1074
01:43:38,151 --> 01:43:39,495
God is within us all

1075
01:43:42,180 --> 01:43:45,345
Stop this nonsense!
Allah is the only God

1076
01:43:45,634 --> 01:43:48,318
Look in the mirror, Mamdu

1077
01:43:48,990 --> 01:43:49,949
Can you see your God?

1078
01:44:00,115 --> 01:44:03,855
Roshan says God is in everyone.
In Gobar and this deaf-mute

1079
01:44:04,431 --> 01:44:06,829
Garland him! Worship him!

1080
01:44:08,459 --> 01:44:12,679
Now watch me!
I'm looking into the mirror

1081
01:44:13,735 --> 01:44:18,242
So that means I'm god too!

1082
01:44:19,874 --> 01:44:23,325
And I created the world.
I created the world!

1083
01:44:29,943 --> 01:44:33,586
Damn it! The world is broken.
Into pieces!

1084
01:44:40,109 --> 01:44:41,741
They've turned into animals

1085
01:44:44,138 --> 01:44:48,165
The devil is perched on their shoulders.
They care for no one

1086
01:44:50,083 --> 01:44:51,426
And feel no shame

1087
01:44:52,673 --> 01:44:53,441
Why did you...

1088
01:44:54,017 --> 01:44:55,647
...visit the temple now?

1089
01:44:59,484 --> 01:45:01,497
Why did Roshan behave so stubbornly?

1090
01:45:02,743 --> 01:45:03,799
We're unworthy

1091
01:45:04,950 --> 01:45:06,292
They showed their true colours

1092
01:45:06,964 --> 01:45:10,416
Delhi folk talk of being large-hearted. Ha!

1093
01:45:22,884 --> 01:45:25,954
I don't feel like dying here now

1094
01:45:36,121 --> 01:45:40,244
Roshan. Take me back to America

1095
01:45:48,396 --> 01:45:49,356
I was leaving...

1096
01:45:51,081 --> 01:45:53,383
Father, I'm leaving home

1097
01:45:54,822 --> 01:45:58,372
I was leaving. Leaving
this madness behind me.

1098
01:45:59,906 --> 01:46:03,741
I don't know what I want.
But I know what I don't want

1099
01:46:07,099 --> 01:46:08,057
Away from Bittu

1100
01:46:11,512 --> 01:46:12,853
And perhaps away from myself

1101
01:46:17,553 --> 01:46:19,664
But I don't know why I wanted to stay

1102
01:46:22,349 --> 01:46:24,842
And embrace this madness.
Be part of it

1103
01:46:33,378 --> 01:46:36,255
Something was stopping me from leaving

1104
01:47:15,961 --> 01:47:18,646
First Gran didn't want to go.
Now I don't want to go

1105
01:47:20,852 --> 01:47:23,059
You don't want to go?
Or never want to go?

1106
01:47:24,115 --> 01:47:25,361
I never want to go

1107
01:47:26,512 --> 01:47:28,142
Despite what happened yesterday?

1108
01:47:29,677 --> 01:47:30,636
Because of yesterday

1109
01:47:32,170 --> 01:47:34,760
"This is a love that isn't easy.
Remember that!"

1110
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:38,404
We lack food. So we get by with love

1111
01:47:40,418 --> 01:47:43,390
Our homes are small.
So we swear by large-heartedness

1112
01:47:44,062 --> 01:47:46,844
A flute sound floats through the tap.
Not water

1113
01:47:47,515 --> 01:47:50,201
You will regret it. Stay far away

1114
01:47:51,159 --> 01:47:52,407
How can I?

1115
01:47:54,421 --> 01:47:55,476
These are my people

1116
01:47:57,203 --> 01:47:58,738
Their virtues and goodness are mine

1117
01:47:59,601 --> 01:48:00,848
Their flaws are mine too

1118
01:48:01,711 --> 01:48:03,822
You're over-emotional, Roshan

1119
01:48:10,917 --> 01:48:12,068
People are good

1120
01:48:17,152 --> 01:48:19,836
My parents never admit it,
but they miss their life here

1121
01:48:22,139 --> 01:48:24,921
They try to recreate this world
in America

1122
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:30,962
But when they open the window,
unfamiliar air blows in

1123
01:48:32,208 --> 01:48:33,647
Deep thinking!

1124
01:48:54,747 --> 01:48:55,898
Can I tell you something?

1125
01:48:57,433 --> 01:49:00,311
This house once belonged to Fatima

1126
01:49:02,613 --> 01:49:03,955
Your mother grew up here

1127
01:49:05,202 --> 01:49:08,175
Before leaving, her family wanted to
sell the house. I bought it

1128
01:49:10,669 --> 01:49:11,533
Don't tell me

1129
01:49:12,395 --> 01:49:14,411
Tell Bittu you love her

1130
01:49:15,657 --> 01:49:19,012
Or you'll end up
buying empty houses like me

1131
01:49:21,410 --> 01:49:24,288
Let your feelings out.
Must they burn inside you?

1132
01:49:42,607 --> 01:49:45,867
This is Delhi-6. Penal Code 144
has been imposed

1133
01:49:46,155 --> 01:49:49,608
This is the shrine where
the trouble started

1134
01:49:50,184 --> 01:49:54,499
Curfew has been imposed.
Is this the lull before the storm?

1135
01:49:54,788 --> 01:49:59,679
Weapons were found behind this tree

1136
01:49:59,966 --> 01:50:05,339
Risking my own life, Kumar Kulshreshtha,
is reporting to you...

1137
01:50:07,829 --> 01:50:09,365
Who gave you permission?

1138
01:50:09,748 --> 01:50:13,968
Here's the capable officer-in-charge,
Ram Vijayji!

1139
01:50:14,257 --> 01:50:18,765
Uncle! Get the name right.
Thakur Ranvijay!

1140
01:50:20,778 --> 01:50:24,232
If we had officers like you
in every neighbourhood...

1141
01:50:24,423 --> 01:50:26,245
It's my duty

1142
01:50:28,547 --> 01:50:30,850
Duty is duty. Duty is first come

1143
01:50:31,425 --> 01:50:33,823
Bring me a strand of
the Black Monkey's hair

1144
01:50:34,109 --> 01:50:37,659
Don't be scared.
You are serving all mankind

1145
01:50:42,837 --> 01:50:46,577
Do as you are told.
Get the Black Monkey's hair!

1146
01:50:47,632 --> 01:50:49,743
Don't you understand?

1147
01:50:54,060 --> 01:50:55,594
Well done! Keep moving

1148
01:51:08,062 --> 01:51:10,651
I wish I had your guts

1149
01:51:11,803 --> 01:51:13,816
Here's some money

1150
01:51:14,488 --> 01:51:17,845
Go. Your dreams are waiting for you

1151
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:41,631
Roshan, Suresh is at the shrine

1152
01:51:43,645 --> 01:51:44,700
You oaf!

1153
01:51:46,713 --> 01:51:50,357
- What are you doing here?
- I have a lot of work, sir

1154
01:51:55,633 --> 01:51:59,949
- Sorry, sir. I'm going home
- Move it! Pissing in my ear!

1155
01:52:03,594 --> 01:52:05,416
Bittu has left home

1156
01:52:29,777 --> 01:52:32,462
Suresh is heading to
Dark Souls' Lane

1157
01:52:44,451 --> 01:52:46,369
What will happen now?

1158
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:47,903
Let the final battle begin!

1159
01:52:48,191 --> 01:52:50,972
Good will win over Evil today

1160
01:53:32,405 --> 01:53:36,434
Today is the day of the great battle

1161
01:53:37,010 --> 01:53:39,502
Today is the day of the great battle

1162
01:53:40,750 --> 01:53:42,092
Hail Lord Ram!

1163
01:53:44,298 --> 01:53:46,217
We call upon the Great Allah

1164
01:53:55,135 --> 01:53:58,012
Balls of a wimp! Look up there!
The Black Monkey!

1165
01:54:04,054 --> 01:54:06,645
Get him! The witch's son

1166
01:54:06,836 --> 01:54:08,756
Play cricket later. Catch the monkey!

1167
01:54:15,660 --> 01:54:17,770
If you see the Black Monkey,
throw water on it

1168
01:54:20,359 --> 01:54:21,798
Throw water!

1169
01:54:24,100 --> 01:54:26,977
Shani Baba! Go! Or else
the Black Monkey will get you

1170
01:54:54,503 --> 01:54:56,709
Get the water! Balls of a wimp!

1171
01:55:13,110 --> 01:55:14,644
The Black Monkey's hair

1172
01:55:16,274 --> 01:55:18,385
No harm in making fools of fools

1173
01:55:46,486 --> 01:55:49,364
The Black Monkey is on our roof

1174
01:55:49,652 --> 01:55:51,858
I saw its shadow

1175
01:55:54,063 --> 01:55:55,021
Bhisham!

1176
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:57,899
Rajjo!

1177
01:55:57,995 --> 01:56:00,873
The Black Monkey threw
Bhisham off the terrace

1178
01:56:02,024 --> 01:56:03,750
Where is he hurt?

1179
01:56:05,572 --> 01:56:08,641
Calls himself a father.
Can't look after his own son

1180
01:56:09,025 --> 01:56:11,902
Left him to the mercy of
the Black Monkey

1181
01:56:17,080 --> 01:56:19,669
Mother Goddess! Save my nephew

1182
01:56:22,836 --> 01:56:26,577
Don't lie. We all have to go to God

1183
01:56:29,550 --> 01:56:31,659
Leaving our riches behind

1184
01:56:35,017 --> 01:56:39,812
O Lord Hanuman! Keep me safe

1185
01:56:42,977 --> 01:56:45,278
O Protector of Lord Ram, save me

1186
01:56:50,170 --> 01:56:51,895
Lalaji!

1187
01:56:53,334 --> 01:56:54,678
Actually, the Black Monkey...

1188
01:56:56,211 --> 01:57:01,488
...is at the heart of the whole problem

1189
01:57:04,652 --> 01:57:08,009
You're absolutely right, Haji Mian

1190
01:57:08,871 --> 01:57:12,421
One minute. I'll come with you

1191
01:57:15,682 --> 01:57:18,079
The Black Monkey isn't far

1192
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:27,382
I told you to throw water on it

1193
01:57:29,876 --> 01:57:30,739
Make him see sense!

1194
01:57:35,534 --> 01:57:36,877
I warned you!

1195
01:57:37,069 --> 01:57:39,947
Everything will be all right

1196
01:57:41,384 --> 01:57:44,839
To save face in the community...

1197
01:57:45,413 --> 01:57:48,003
...we'll say the Black Monkey
kidnapped Bittu

1198
01:57:48,770 --> 01:57:50,593
It will shut them up. Right?

1199
01:57:56,923 --> 01:57:58,169
Bittu! Where are you?

1200
01:57:59,704 --> 01:58:00,663
You sure you have the tickets?

1201
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:02,389
I checked them four times

1202
01:58:02,772 --> 01:58:05,267
I landed in trouble.
I had to slap the Inspector

1203
01:58:05,651 --> 01:58:07,473
Stop bragging! Let's go

1204
01:58:09,775 --> 01:58:10,925
What is it? Hurry!

1205
01:58:13,419 --> 01:58:14,570
Suresh!

1206
01:58:41,425 --> 01:58:42,097
You!

1207
01:58:43,150 --> 01:58:47,754
What have you done? Why did you
need to do this? I had almost escaped

1208
01:58:49,672 --> 01:58:51,399
He ran and left you
at the Black Monkey's mercy

1209
01:58:51,590 --> 01:58:53,413
You're leaving me too. For America

1210
01:59:12,882 --> 01:59:14,801
I'm incomplete without you

1211
01:59:24,967 --> 01:59:26,981
I thought you'd never say it

1212
01:59:45,779 --> 01:59:48,369
Balls of wimp! You've been
messing us around for days

1213
01:59:58,440 --> 01:59:59,973
He isn't the Black Monkey

1214
02:00:00,166 --> 02:00:00,932
Teach him a lesson!

1215
02:00:01,124 --> 02:00:04,002
- Let him go!
- Stop!

1216
02:00:15,608 --> 02:00:17,046
He's no Black Monkey

1217
02:00:17,526 --> 02:00:18,965
I have the monkey's hair

1218
02:00:19,828 --> 02:00:20,979
Stop it!

1219
02:00:21,746 --> 02:00:22,897
I have the monkey's hair!

1220
02:00:26,732 --> 02:00:27,788
Look! The hair

1221
02:01:14,207 --> 02:01:17,277
- Father, stop them!
- Shut up!

1222
02:01:18,235 --> 02:01:20,058
Jaigopal! Beat him to a pulp!

1223
02:01:32,815 --> 02:01:34,158
Creating nothing but trouble

1224
02:01:41,157 --> 02:01:42,501
The Black Monkey

1225
02:01:43,651 --> 02:01:46,049
You can't be the Black Monkey
just by wearing a two-penny suit

1226
02:01:51,515 --> 02:01:54,873
Destroy it!
Shani Baba will fix everything, ok!

1227
02:02:00,916 --> 02:02:01,778
The Black Monkey

1228
02:02:22,783 --> 02:02:23,839
Roshan

1229
02:02:48,775 --> 02:02:50,117
You killed him?

1230
02:02:53,185 --> 02:02:54,049
Bravo!

1231
02:02:55,200 --> 02:02:59,419
You would've killed each other if
he hadn't posed as the Black Monkey

1232
02:03:18,026 --> 02:03:20,807
The Black Monkey is laughing at us

1233
02:03:24,932 --> 02:03:26,370
It isn't dead

1234
02:03:30,303 --> 02:03:32,126
It is sitting inside us

1235
02:03:33,660 --> 02:03:34,714
In some dark corner

1236
02:03:35,195 --> 02:03:36,633
In every one of us

1237
02:03:38,551 --> 02:03:39,990
Laughing at us

1238
02:03:52,649 --> 02:03:55,911
The Black Monkey killed Roshan

1239
02:04:05,118 --> 02:04:07,995
He pretended to be the monkey
out of love for us

1240
02:04:09,914 --> 02:04:11,639
Out of love for Bittu

1241
02:04:20,559 --> 02:04:21,805
Call an ambulance!

1242
02:05:00,169 --> 02:05:04,774
Mamdu is just like his father.
Too much sugar in his sweets

1243
02:05:07,267 --> 02:05:09,089
Grandad! Why bother
how sweet sweets are?

1244
02:05:12,350 --> 02:05:14,749
We Delhi folk didn't treat you right

1245
02:05:20,023 --> 02:05:22,517
They're good-hearted people, Granddad

1246
02:05:23,859 --> 02:05:26,065
The devil is perched on their shoulders

1247
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:28,559
Not the devil. A monkey

1248
02:05:40,932 --> 02:05:42,945
My Black Monkey stayed within me

1249
02:05:49,754 --> 02:05:52,057
If only I could apologize to your mother

1250
02:05:55,989 --> 02:05:57,428
Do it now

1251
02:06:02,510 --> 02:06:03,086
Call her!

1252
02:06:17,281 --> 02:06:19,486
Cracks blemish the line of my destiny

1253
02:06:20,254 --> 02:06:23,035
Repair my fate, O Master

1254
02:06:27,160 --> 02:06:30,805
I bow at Your door.
My being erased andthen remade

1255
02:06:32,913 --> 02:06:35,791
Repair my fate, O Master

1256
02:06:41,833 --> 02:06:42,601
Start driving!

1257
02:06:47,204 --> 02:06:48,547
What's wrong?

1258
02:06:58,041 --> 02:06:58,906
The injection!

1259
02:07:21,540 --> 02:07:22,690
He's gone

1260
02:07:24,033 --> 02:07:25,759
Help him! Do something

1261
02:07:48,874 --> 02:07:50,025
We'll meet again

1262
02:07:55,492 --> 02:07:56,451
Roshan has gained consciousness

1263
02:08:33,664 --> 02:08:37,596
As poet Zauq says: "Who can ever
wish to leave Delhi's lanes?"

1264
02:09:21,523 --> 02:09:23,632
Gobar was so right

1265
02:09:25,070 --> 02:09:29,386
The Black Monkey or something like it
is within all of us

1266
02:09:32,169 --> 02:09:37,635
Whenever there is anger and hatred,
the monkey becomes more powerful

1267
02:09:40,991 --> 02:09:43,103
And we use it to our advantage

1268
02:09:44,253 --> 02:09:48,760
But instead of destroying the Black
Monkey within us, we kill each other

1269
02:09:57,009 --> 02:09:59,790
The Black Monkey turned to ashes
like the demon Ravan

1270
02:10:01,900 --> 02:10:06,312
As for me, this is home.
And mine is a story of home-coming
