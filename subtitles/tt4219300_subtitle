1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500


3
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:24,166
It's said that children are born head first..

4
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,500
..so they can lead a straight life.

5
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,708
These poor kids were born straight..

6
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,333
..in this cruel world.

7
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,500
This is Pappu.

8
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,541
He loves tightening bolts.

9
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,208
When he grew up he became a mechanic.

10
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,458
And this one, sailing in the air, he's Golu.

11
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:45,541
He loves going out.

12
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,541
And so he became a tour guide.

13
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,625
Mother, look at my report card.

14
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,208
Wow...

15
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:59,416
Pappu, read it for me.

16
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:03,375
First! First! First! First! First!

17
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,375
He stood first in every subject.

18
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:06,916
And passed in just one.

19
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,458
Wow! At least someone came first.

20
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,333
Come, my engineer. You too.

21
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,125
Mom, I'll turn this radio into a television by tonight. - Really?

22
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,833
"Gollu-Pappu in the house."

23
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,875
"Let me...let me make 'em bounce."

24
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,916
"Let me...let me take 'em out."

25
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,916
"Let me show 'em..."

26
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,000
"Gollu-Pappu in the house."

27
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,916
"Let me...let me make 'em bounce."

28
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,083
"Let me...let me take 'em out."

29
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,833
"Let me show 'em what I am about."

30
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:35,875
"They're carefree good for nothing guys."

31
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,916
"They make possible...impossible."

32
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:44,333
"They think they are smarty, but be advised."

33
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:48,333
"They are very overdramatic."

34
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:53,583
"Stop it now."

35
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,708
"Don't trouble me anymore."

36
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,750
"Mind your own business."

37
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,541
"Spare the people."

38
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,375
"Gollu...Pappu."

39
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,625
"How many times are you going to goof up?"

40
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,458
"What's wrong with you, don't try to be too smart."

41
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,500
"Gollu...Pappu."

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,708
"How many times are you going to goof up?"

43
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:17,791
"What's wrong with you, don't try to be too smart."

44
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,125
They are a bit stupid..

45
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,125
..but very special at heart.

46
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,708
But if you ever run into these two..

47
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,750
..then meet with caution.

48
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,750
Because this is Gollu...and this is Pappu.

49
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,375
Alpha calling 2426.

50
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,208
2426...go for Amritsar!

51
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,375
Alpha calling.

52
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:53,583
Sir, we spotted some militants near the cottage.

53
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,708
Immediate backup required. Over.

54
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes, sir. We'll take necessary action.

55
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,041
No need to inform anyone else.

56
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:03,041
Commandoes!

57
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,625
Teacher!

58
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,583
"Gollu..."

59
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,750
"Pappu!"

60
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,875
Teacher...mom's out of town.

61
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,666
And we were hungry. - So...did you have to steal in my house?

62
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,958
Teacher, don't say such a disgusting thing.

63
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,166
We didn't steal.

64
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,791
You weren't at home. So we just sneaked in your home..

65
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:05,250
..and ate your food. Do you call that stealing?

66
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,416
Son...that's called stealing.

67
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,250
When your mom returns..

68
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,583
..I'm going to tell her about you two.

69
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,541
Gollu...we committed a crime.

70
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,250
This is really bad.

71
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,541
Teacher, don't forget to tell mom about us.

72
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,625
By the way, what are you going to tell our mom?

73
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,666
I am going to tell your mom tomorrow..

74
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,125
..that you two robbed my home.

75
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,333
Tomorrow?

76
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:32,333
But we won't come back to your house tomorrow.

77
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,958
I mean...I'll tell her tomorrow..

78
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,458
..that you robbed my house today.

79
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,416
How can you say it tomorrow? We did it today.

80
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:40,916
So I'll say today.

81
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,708
How can you tell her today? Mom's not at home.

82
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,000
I mean...I'll tell her tomorrow..

83
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,208
..that you two robbed me today.

84
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:48,250
But we won't do it tomorrow..

85
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,750
..how can you say it today?

86
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,041
So I'll tell her today...that you stole today.

87
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:58,541
That's the limit. Mom isn't here today, how will you tell her?

88
00:06:59,041 --> 00:06:59,500
Egg..

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,500
My egg..

90
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:08,166
Come with me.

91
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:09,958
What are you doing?

92
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,458
Tell us something.

93
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,166
Where are you taking us?

94
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,208
You could've at least let me have the egg. Where are you..

95
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:17,958
Go away.

96
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,416
You will have to tell our mom.

97
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,666
We committed a crime and we should be punished for it.

98
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,583
Yes, brother..

99
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,416
Punishment.

100
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,000
What for?

101
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,375
Who said that you robbed me?

102
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:31,958
No...

103
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:35,750
You broke my door...sneaked in my house.

104
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,583
Ate all my food, left nothing for me.

105
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,083
That's not called stealing.

106
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,666
No..

107
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,750
This means you were falsely accusing us.

108
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,000
Let mom come back.

109
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,458
We'll tell her about this. - Yes, we'll tell mom.

110
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:52,458
Yes.

111
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:56,458
Down!

112
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,833
Beautiful!

113
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,750
Hurry up!

114
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,708
That's 4 million down the drain.

115
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,666
Of course.

116
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,375
I'm coming to Delhi really soon, with family.

117
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,333
I'll definitely pay a visit to your store.

118
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,583
Goodbye.

119
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,625
Brother Gustad, the police know..

120
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:04,583
..that our boys are in the city. - Fool.

121
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,041
Do you know the consequences..

122
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,583
..of addressing me by that name here?

123
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,750
It can be really dangerous.

124
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:15,333
Brother Abdullah. - Actually, I received this news long ago.

125
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:22,208
Those who have been spotted, shouldn't be seen again.

126
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:26,208
Finish them!

127
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,916
Kill them!

128
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:38,583
Fear, Sarfaraz. Fear!

129
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,000
A bullet can kill one person.

130
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,833
A bomb can kill 30-40 people.

131
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,625
But fear...

132
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,000
Fear gives rise to terror..

133
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,916
..and makes their life difficult.

134
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:57,541
People aren't afraid anymore.

135
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:02,541
We need to keep it alive.

136
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,125
There's a celebration at the village square tomorrow.

137
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,750
It will be attended by many people.

138
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,250
Prepare for a huge blast.

139
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,125
What an idea.

140
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,250
Brother, 'Holi' is approaching too.

141
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,708
Why don't I make a blast?

142
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,750
Yes, brother?

143
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,375
Milk and eggs were fine.

144
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,458
They even ate my rice.

145
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,333
Every time you go out of the city..

146
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:28,750
..these charge at my house.

147
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,375
Hello. - Yeah!

148
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,500
I feel more like their chef.

149
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,500
Pappu!

150
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,333
Pappu!

151
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:39,750
Pappu!

152
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,958
Brother Pappu's in trouble.

153
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:46,041
Brother Pappu's in trouble.

154
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,875
Pappu!

155
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,041
Pappu!

156
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,500
Pappu!

157
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,666
Pappu!

158
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,916
Mom! Mom!

159
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,791
Shameless! You're not a kid anymore.

160
00:11:59,291 --> 00:11:59,708
Stop smiling.

161
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,791
Stop smiling or else I'll break your jaw.

162
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,166
Mom... - Aren't you ashamed.

163
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:09,041
You sneaked into Chimanlal's house and.. - Ta-dah!

164
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,125
It took me six months.

165
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,208
But, it's as good as new.

166
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:19,000
Mother...I saved father's scooter.

167
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,125
I just gave it a different color.

168
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,125
Everything else is exactly the same.

169
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,583
I installed a fan... and it works.

170
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:28,875
And the seat.

171
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:34,166
Seat... It's new.

172
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:39,583
Handle... it's the latest design.

173
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:40,875
Should I start it up?

174
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,875
Twist the accelerator, it sound's really smooth.

175
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,416
Aunty's going to whack him today.

176
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,375
Let's make a bet.

177
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,791
Sorry, teacher. It was a mistake.

178
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,000
It's wrong to gamble.

179
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,375
Be quiet.

180
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,791
It's wrong to make such small bets.

181
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,333
I bet 50. Here.

182
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,916
She's going to whack him today. Go.

183
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,875
And the headlight bulb's new too.

184
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,375
Forget that.

185
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,500
And tell me... what belongs to your father?

186
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,333
It's just like before.

187
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:19,833
The 27 screws I used to fasten the engine..

188
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,041
..is from father's scooter.

189
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,583
The clutch...clutch wire..

190
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,833
Mom, I couldn't save father but..

191
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,708
..at least I saved his scooter.

192
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,625
Whenever you miss father..

193
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,541
..you can hug this scooter and cry all you want.

194
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:33,833
Stupid.

195
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,875
Don't you see a difference between a scooter and your father?

196
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,000
Stop blabbering!

197
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,000
Can't you see what my son did?

198
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,083
You're busy finding his mistakes.

199
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,125
Get lost. The man of our house..

200
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,791
..will pay you for your rice!

201
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,125
Pay him Pappu!

202
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,291
Yes, I will pay you.

203
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:53,666
Now get lost. - Fine, I am going.

204
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,666
No respect for teacher.

205
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,625
Keep this.

206
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:04,791
Mom..

207
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,208
This belongs to father.

208
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:08,458
Now it's yours.

209
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,166
You're the man of the house now.

210
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,375
The scooter's really nice.

211
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,791
Listen...where's Gollu?

212
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,541
Has he seen the scooter? - No.

213
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,416
He must be lost in the dreams..

214
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:25,416
..of his angel...somewhere.

215
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:38,375
Buddy...she's an angel..

216
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:44,208
I looked in her eyes once...and it was like magic.

217
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:45,625
She came to see Kashmir. - I see.

218
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,625
I showed her around.

219
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:08,250
You know love...just happens.

220
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,416
It just hits you hard...suddenly.

221
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,791
You don't know when it strikes.

222
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:17,583
She just came...and left.

223
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,916
I couldn't even tell her anything.

224
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:26,875
But...even I don't know where she went.

225
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,416
And...I have a beautiful name for her.

226
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:31,708
Pari Madam!

227
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:36,958
You know, Gollu, the day I fell in love with your sister-in-law.

228
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,541
I didn't stop.

229
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,958
I went straight to her room and kissed her cheeks.

230
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:46,166
You do it too.

231
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,083
Why will I kiss sister-in-law?

232
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,541
She's like my sister. - I wasn't talking about Lovely.

233
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:55,416
I am talking about your Pari madam. - No.

234
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:56,833
I won't kiss her.

235
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:03,500
My love is pure.

236
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,500
You want to see something unique? - Yeah!

237
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,625
Plane-letter.

238
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,625
I've written my feelings on it...for madam.

239
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,833
I pray that I see her again.

240
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:31,166
And I'll just throw this in her direction.

241
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:36,000
If this touches her..

242
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,875
..the she will be mine forever.

243
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,083
Balbeer, I'll keep this close to my heart.

244
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,541
Be careful, the brakes aren't working.

245
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:47,541
Brakes might fail, but my heart won't.

246
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,208
Baba, move aside!

247
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:05,000
Baba! Baba, move aside!

248
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,000
No...

249
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:14,083
No... No, Baba...

250
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,083
Gollu's made it really well.

251
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:33,375
There's a thread attached too.

252
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:37,375
The eyes are flashing as well.

253
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,500
For now, I just blew his head..

254
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,666
..tomorrow, I'll blow up the village square.

255
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,375
Brother..

256
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,125
The bomb inside the statue has been activated.

257
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,541
Huh? - Yes.

258
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:53,541
It will explode in 30 minutes. - Explode.

259
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,333
Gollu, if the brakes weren't working..

260
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,125
..then you should've checked why it's not working.

261
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,541
I didn't realize before I bumped into that statue.

262
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,458
Bro, what's going to happen tomorrow?

263
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,541
When people will felicitate Baba..

264
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,333
..they'll fine a headless statue, instead of a head.

265
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,250
Gollu, you've a weak heart.

266
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,666
You get scared soon.

267
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:20,666
What's the most they can do? They will clobber us with their shoes.

268
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,208
Only with their shoes? - Of course.

269
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,958
Maybe...some crazy men..

270
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,750
..can take a big sword and cut us to pieces.

271
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,541
No one can dare to do anything more.

272
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:39,541
Are you scared anymore?

273
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,458
Bro..

274
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:45,250
Yes.

275
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,541
Let's fix the head back to the body with glue.

276
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:53,541
Yes, go do it. - Yes!

277
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,250
Baba...

278
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,208
Yes.

279
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:11,750
Wait, Baba..

280
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,708
I have the head. - Yes.

281
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,375
I will have the body too. - Yes.

282
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,458
So what will we keep there?

283
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,333
Go..

284
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,708
"I love my India."

285
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,458
"I love my India."

286
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,625
"I love my India."

287
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:36,333
"I love my India."

288
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:40,833
Get lost. Go..

289
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,541
That way. Not here.

290
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:44,750
Go that way.

291
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,750
Where's the voice coming from? I'll do it here.

292
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,333
I like doing it here. I'll do it right here.

293
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,125
I'll kick you so hard..

294
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:57,583
..you'll be p*** in a can all your life.

295
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,250
Where's the voice coming from?

296
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,208
Get lost!

297
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:04,500
Get lost!

298
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,416
Okay. Okay.

299
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:11,416
Okay.

300
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,083
Hey...

301
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,000
I can see it. - Where? - I can see everything.

302
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,541
Stop!

303
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,708
Who's screaming?

304
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,125
Where are you? Who's screaming?

305
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,916
It's me...Baba.

306
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,208
What Baba..

307
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:35,375
Look here. Up here..

308
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:36,791
Baba!

309
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:37,666
That way.

310
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:38,333
Baba!

311
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:39,750
Get lost, son... That way.

312
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,791
Baba?

313
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,375
Baba has come to life.

314
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:45,833
Glory to Baba!

315
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,666
Baba has come to life.

316
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,375
Glory to Baba!

317
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,958
I've got Baba's blessings.

318
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,250
Glory to Baba!

319
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,791
Come back.

320
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:59,791
Gollu!

321
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,833
Brother, I guess the bomb-squad took the entire statue.

322
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,958
I sure it was R.A.W. - No!

323
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,708
Some Americans were spotted in the area.

324
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,250
I'm sure they sniffed out the bomb.

325
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,750
Whether it was Americans or R.A.W.

326
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,583
They saved at least 100 people.

327
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:31,583
What now, brother?

328
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,875
Careful, Baba!

329
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:46,875
"Gollu...Pappu.."

330
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,000
Pari madam.

331
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:42,125
Let's tie a thread on Baba's wrist.

332
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,000
No!

333
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:03,208
Pari madam!

334
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:17,666
Why they stole the Idol?

335
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,458
All your questions will be answered..

336
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,416
But at the right time.

337
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:24,333
Get them out of here.

338
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:25,666
Sir..

339
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:27,375
Are you listening?

340
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,041
Do you see these reporters?

341
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:30,833
Do you have an answer?

342
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,875
They will destroy us with their reports.

343
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,791
And you're responsible for this, Shalini.

344
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:38,208
If you had apprehended Gustad's accomplices..

345
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:39,875
..then this explosion would've never occurred.

346
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:41,958
Sir, Gustad will be caught soon.

347
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:43,791
My men have spread out.

348
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:45,208
Yes, they have spread out..

349
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:47,791
..but only with the bribes that they get.

350
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:51,875
Sir...that's not it. - Shut up!

351
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:54,708
You never understood the responsibilities of a police.

352
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:57,041
It's just a means for getting bribes.

353
00:24:57,541 --> 00:24:58,458
You're here on deputation.

354
00:24:58,958 --> 00:24:59,916
Still you tried to capture Gustad's men..

355
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,166
..without any backup.

356
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:07,375
Sir.. - Even we don't know who Gustad is, what he looks like.

357
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,958
We see new faces every day.

358
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:14,958
Sir.. - Shut up. And take this.

359
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,666
Sir...you're embarrassing me.

360
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:23,333
I can do my job without this.

361
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:25,916
This is not a bribe.

362
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:27,750
These are your transfer orders.

363
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,208
From tomorrow, you will be assuming your post..

364
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:30,833
..as the Manager at JN Guest house.

365
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:32,875
Sir?

366
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:36,875
What..

367
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:43,458
Sharma...I paid 4 million for this posting.

368
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:45,875
I thought the extra income would be great.

369
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:47,250
What do I do now?

370
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,750
It's a big problem. - Madam, this is not a problem.

371
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,333
What? - It's a disaster.

372
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,541
You are ruined.

373
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:57,250
You were being greedy.

374
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,500
You wanted to earn 5 million by arresting Gustad.

375
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,625
Are you happy now?

376
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:04,458
You could've solved small cases..

377
00:26:04,958 --> 00:26:06,458
..and made 4-500, 000 in a month.

378
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:07,708
You would've been happy.

379
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:10,750
Inspector madam, now go to Delhi.

380
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,125
You can repay your debt..

381
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:14,541
..from the tips that you'll get from the Ministers.

382
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:16,458
Sharma.

383
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:19,250
Do Minister's tip so heavily?

384
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,250
Madam...I was just saying that.

385
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:39,000
I pray that Gustad's body rots to hell.

386
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:44,541
And worms feeds on his body.

387
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:48,041
What are you looking for?

388
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:49,750
You cannot trust him.

389
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,958
He can plant it anywhere... Explosives.

390
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:54,333
Calm down, Chimanlal.

391
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:59,166
Sit down. You've nothing to fear.

392
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:02,708
Gustad only troubles the poor and good.

393
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:06,791
Thank God! Thank God!

394
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:08,000
Stop it, Gollu.

395
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,041
Stop crying.

396
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:12,500
Thank God that you were unharmed.

397
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,791
Otherwise I would've caught that Gustad in the jungle..

398
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:18,208
..and thrashed him black and blue.

399
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:20,500
You would've gone in the jungle and thrashed Gustad?

400
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,083
Of course I would.

401
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:26,041
He made my Gollu cry. Ruined his scooter. Useless.

402
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:28,041
Why did you get up? Sit down.

403
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:31,041
You're not worth it.

404
00:27:31,541 --> 00:27:33,541
How about some sweetmeat?

405
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:36,583
You'll stop crying if you eat something.

406
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:39,541
I'll get some right away.

407
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:40,416
Yes.

408
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:42,333
Send a bottle of whiskey.

409
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:46,750
I'll give better marks to your kid.

410
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:51,000
Gollu.

411
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,791
If mom can go in the jungle and thrash Gustad..

412
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:58,791
..then, why can't I?

413
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:08,916
Brother. Brother.

414
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:13,916
Gustad! Gustad!

415
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:15,041
Gustad, come out.

416
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:19,041
No. No, brother.

417
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:24,708
Gustad!

418
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:26,958
Gustad!

419
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:29,625
What are you doing? - What you're trying to do is risky.

420
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,458
Don't do it. - He started it.

421
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:33,541
So what if it's risky.

422
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:37,541
I will beat him to a pulp..

423
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:50,875
Jungle men...

424
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:22,958
Turn around.

425
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:25,375
Brother, he's a magician.

426
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:28,166
He speaks without moving his lips.

427
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:31,541
Where else can you speak from?

428
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:35,541
Turn around.

429
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:45,208
Why are you here?

430
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:47,041
We're looking for Gustad Khan.

431
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:49,375
And we'll tell him why, not you.

432
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:53,375
Yes.

433
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:56,166
I am Gustad... speak up.

434
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:57,666
Don't joke with us.

435
00:29:58,166 --> 00:29:59,541
Later don't say that you're not Gustad.

436
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:03,541
I am Gustad!

437
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,125
Rascal. Scoundrel. Stupid oaf...you fool..

438
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:12,166
You blew up my garage, my scooter. - Yes.

439
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:13,750
Now how will he take tourists around for sightseeing?

440
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,208
Will you carry them around?

441
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:17,541
Pay up for the scooter. Pay up for the scooter.

442
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:21,541
Sarfaraz, no!

443
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:31,958
What's the price of your scooter?

444
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:34,958
See...one slap, and he's ready to compensate for the scooter.

445
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:39,208
Few more, and he would pay us anything.

446
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:42,583
8,851 rupees.

447
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:45,833
I can pay you much more.

448
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:49,250
I can pay you millions.

449
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,125
All you need to do is sacrifice some roosters!

450
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:55,916
10,000 for every rooster!

451
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:58,166
10,000!

452
00:30:58,666 --> 00:30:59,666
Think...think..

453
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:02,958
I am not in a hurry.

454
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:04,541
Think it through and let me know.

455
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:07,958
Take them away.

456
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:10,000
Take good care of them.

457
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,875
They are my guests.

458
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:13,666
He's so strange, Gollu.

459
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:18,333
Showing hospitality with guns.

460
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:22,166
Brother, what's the point of sparing these two fools?

461
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:27,333
Their death is no achievement for us.

462
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:33,416
And if they're caught, then no one will believe them.

463
00:31:33,916 --> 00:31:39,791
And if they do the job, then we'll benefit from all this.

464
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:44,208
Brother, why is he paying us 10,000 for a rooster?

465
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:46,250
It costs only around 100-150.

466
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,500
Why is he paying so much for one cock?

467
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,916
What do you think? He's paying us to kill roosters?

468
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:53,541
He's just scared, and thinks..

469
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:57,541
..if he doesn't settle the matter, I'll beat him again.

470
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:06,708
Brother, can I say something? - Yes.

471
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,333
We shouldn't take money from him.

472
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:16,000
He's not a nice man, this Gustad.

473
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,708
We should just get him arrested.

474
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:22,541
Gollu, let's get back the money that we lost.

475
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,250
We will get him arrested later.

476
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:31,083
Look, Golu. Money is important. - No.

477
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:36,666
If I had money, then father's treatment..

478
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:40,791
I could've got better treatment for father.

479
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:47,333
We'll open a shop from the money we get now.

480
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,666
In mother's name, right?

481
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:53,041
Brother...

482
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:55,541
Babli Mom Motor Store.

483
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:57,833
Brother, I will kill roosters.

484
00:32:58,333 --> 00:32:59,541
I am going to kill so many roosters..

485
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:03,625
..that our lives will soon change forever.

486
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:07,916
You're in a hurry. - Yes.

487
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:11,916
There's your toy. Come. Come.

488
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:23,958
Beautiful, isn't it?

489
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:27,958
But it's also dangerous.

490
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:36,041
In order to use this, you first need to set a time..

491
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:38,000
..for it to explode.

492
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,041
For that we feed in a code.

493
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:41,125
Code...

494
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:46,250
Like 555...

495
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,416
Now it's armed. - I see.

496
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:51,416
And if you need to deactivate it for any reason, then..

497
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:52,833
Huh?

498
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:54,333
Switch it off!

499
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:57,833
You need to punch in the same code.

500
00:33:58,333 --> 00:33:59,500
555!

501
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,625
5!

502
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:04,958
Red, yellow, green...

503
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:09,625
This proves...you worked for the traffic police.

504
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:12,375
Why did you quit a government job for this business?

505
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:15,375
Don't call this a business!

506
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:19,625
I am paying you two a handsome amount.

507
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:24,625
10,000 for every dead body.

508
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:26,041
Dead body?

509
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:28,250
Are you crazy?

510
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,791
Look, roosters were fine.

511
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:31,916
We can even kill goats. But we won't kill men.

512
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:37,625
Don't joke with us. Did you forget what I did yesterday?

513
00:34:38,125 --> 00:34:40,041
Come here.

514
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:43,041
Look.

515
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:44,541
What's..

516
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,125
Mom!

517
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:49,333
Those men behind your mom are mine.

518
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:51,041
They're carrying a bomb.

519
00:34:51,541 --> 00:34:52,750
Mom, no...

520
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,125
It hasn't exploded yet.

521
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:58,125
So...

522
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,541
But it can.

523
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:08,875
If you don't go to Ludhiana and detonate my bomb.

524
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:10,041
What?

525
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,041
Ludhiana?

526
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:13,708
My Gollu-Pappu? - Yes, of course.

527
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:18,583
Your son Gollu... drives the scooter really well.

528
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,375
We held a race yesterday.

529
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:23,250
And he won amongst 50 men.

530
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,541
Wow!

531
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:25,583
Just watch..

532
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:29,750
He'll make a big bang in Ludhiana.

533
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,416
I see...

534
00:35:31,916 --> 00:35:35,208
So that's why you two were missing all night.

535
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:37,041
Fine, okay.

536
00:35:37,541 --> 00:35:38,666
I'll pack my bags.

537
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:40,375
No..

538
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,166
Why are you taking the trouble?

539
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:43,333
This is their job.

540
00:35:43,833 --> 00:35:44,916
This is no trouble at all.

541
00:35:45,416 --> 00:35:46,333
They're the ones who will be in trouble.

542
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:48,583
They just learnt to wipe their noses last year.

543
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:52,541
Aunty, how long are you going to look after them?

544
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:55,541
They are grownups now.

545
00:35:56,041 --> 00:36:00,000
God forbid, if anything happens to you tomorrow..

546
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,166
..how will they survive?

547
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:06,166
Right?

548
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,125
He's right you two.

549
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:12,541
You two will never grow up for me.

550
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:14,666
But you will have to grow up for the world.

551
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:16,500
Don't sulk now.

552
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,833
Go with a smile. Come on.

553
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:20,750
And don't worry about your mother at all.

554
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:25,041
I'm leaving my men here to look after her.

555
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:28,125
They will treat her like their own mother.

556
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:29,916
Come on. Now let's get to work.

557
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:31,500
God bless you. - Come on.

558
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,958
Come.

559
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:34,583
Bless you.

560
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:37,750
Come on now...smile.

561
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:41,208
Gollu-Pappu's going to win!

562
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:44,541
Gollu-Pappu's going to win!

563
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:46,541
Every say..

564
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:49,666
Listen... be sure to win.

565
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,083
I want to see your picture in the papers.

566
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:54,875
So be it, they will definitely win.

567
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:58,875
Their photos will be on every newspaper.

568
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:29,958
"I feel lost...my eyes are filled with tears."

569
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:39,375
"Truly mom, I miss you every moment."

570
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:48,500
"Come bless me again, mom."

571
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:57,750
"Hide me in your arms once again."

572
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:10,083
"Life feels stagnant...without your blessings."

573
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:19,125
"I feel lost...my eyes are filled with tears."

574
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:28,583
"Truly mom, I miss you every moment."

575
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:32,708
Gollu, we're reached the bus stop. - Brother, I see it.

576
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:34,208
Don't push. - I want a ticket.

577
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:35,416
What are you doing? - We want to go too.

578
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:37,333
I want to buy a ticket as well.

579
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:38,166
You buy it first.

580
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:40,625
I want a ticket to Ludhiana. Ludhiana.

581
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:41,875
Here.

582
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:43,458
What language is this?

583
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:45,041
It's in English. I don't know English.

584
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:46,041
I don't care.

585
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:47,666
Why don't you just walk over me?

586
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:50,000
First of all their tickets are in English.

587
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,791
And I want to go to Ludhiana.

588
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:53,666
Hello, aunty.

589
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:55,750
My chain!

590
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,083
My chain!

591
00:38:57,583 --> 00:38:58,125
My chain!

592
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:00,666
Hey... You forgot your chain.

593
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:03,166
My chain.

594
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:05,333
Is this yours? - Yes. It's my chain.

595
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:06,583
My chain.

596
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:08,750
This is my husband's last memorabilia, son.

597
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,541
Don't say that, aunty. He'll come back.

598
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:13,041
Give you many more memorabilia's. - No, son. No.

599
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:15,583
He's gone far away.

600
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:20,333
On foot? He'll come back. - No.

601
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:22,875
Thank you, son.

602
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:27,500
Aunty is so old, and uncle's so young.

603
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,500
He's bound to run!

604
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,208
Stop! Stop! Stop!

605
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:39,791
I'll walk from here.

606
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:41,958
Hello, Mr. Puri. - Hello.

607
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:43,208
The bus stop's up ahead.

608
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:46,166
I am a civilian now, I'll walk to the bus stop.

609
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:49,208
Thank you. My luggage? - I'll get the luggage, sir.

610
00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:51,958
But bring it to the bus.

611
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:55,958
Give it to me.

612
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:02,625
The chain and lock is mine, the suitcase is not.

613
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:03,833
Get up.

614
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:06,416
Get up!

615
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:08,583
Why are you telling me this? What's wrong?

616
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:10,166
Bunty. - Yes, mother.

617
00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:13,208
Bunty...what's going on?

618
00:40:13,708 --> 00:40:15,291
You've started again.

619
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:18,208
Bunty, you've retired from the police, but..

620
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,750
..you haven't forsaken your habits yet.

621
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,208
Why are you bothering this nice boy? - Nice boy?

622
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:24,166
Do you know him?

623
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:27,083
Yes. He's a very nice man.

624
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:29,250
You know... See..

625
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,916
A thief was running away with my chain.

626
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:33,166
But he got it back.

627
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:35,833
Thief... He wasn't uncle..

628
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,916
Sorry, I made a mistake. Don't feel offended.

629
00:40:39,416 --> 00:40:41,833
You see, the police job has made me look fierce.

630
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:44,416
That's why I made him quit his police job.

631
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:47,625
Now I am the Mall's security in-charge.

632
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:48,916
Let's go. - Oh yes..

633
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:50,875
See you. Let's go, mom.

634
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:53,625
Gollu, forget that we're carrying a bomb.

635
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:56,875
Completely forsake it from your mind.

636
00:40:57,375 --> 00:40:58,083
Look, Gollu.

637
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:01,041
No one should suspect that we've something.

638
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:04,250
If we're caught, how will we save Babli mom.

639
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,041
Come on, our bus is waiting there.

640
00:41:06,541 --> 00:41:07,166
Come on.

641
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:10,500
Hey.. Come here.

642
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,541
Where's the suitcase? - I forgot.

643
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:15,583
Why? - You said that I should forget..

644
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:20,458
..that we're carrying a bomb.

645
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:22,458
Driver, don't forget to feed him to time.

646
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:25,208
And Bunty, call me as soon as you get there. - Yes, mother.

647
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:28,375
I will call you in the morning, noon, evening and night.

648
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:32,375
Now leave, mom!

649
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:38,916
Start the bus, hurry up.

650
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:49,041
Okay, sir. We'll check.

651
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:50,125
Stop the bus.

652
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:53,333
Chaudhary, be alert. Be alert.

653
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:54,583
Check properly. Check on the top as well.

654
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:57,000
I'll check on top as well.

655
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,291
Brother, the police is coming up.

656
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:01,875
Gollu, pretend like we have nothing.

657
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:04,458
He shouldn't get suspicious.

658
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:05,208
Sit down.

659
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:07,208
Hey cop...you can take a look if you want.

660
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:11,041
We have nothing to show.

661
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:13,625
He'll get suspicious if you talk like that.

662
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:15,291
Hey mister..

663
00:42:15,791 --> 00:42:19,291
Forget what I said earlier.

664
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:23,791
Quiet!

665
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,541
And listen, I won't show you what's in this suitcase..

666
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:28,166
..even if you kill me.

667
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:29,458
No matter what you do, I won't show you.

668
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:31,083
You can beat me to a pulp.

669
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,958
Even if you kiss and hug me.. - Quiet!

670
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:36,125
What's in your suitcase?

671
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:37,500
What's in your suitcase?

672
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,666
We're looking for a girl..

673
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:40,041
..who committed robbery in her own house.

674
00:42:40,541 --> 00:42:42,625
Is she in your suitcase?

675
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:46,125
Move aside.

676
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:48,375
You will get us killed. You didn't have to say anything.

677
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:51,708
You could have simply gestured, that..

678
00:42:52,208 --> 00:42:53,875
Like..

679
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:57,875
There is no 'bomb' in this..

680
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,000
Sir, there's no girl here.

681
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,625
Let the bus go.

682
00:43:09,125 --> 00:43:12,416
Move forward.

683
00:43:12,916 --> 00:43:14,833
Curse you...you oaf!

684
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:16,750
Rascal!

685
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,625
Are you blind?

686
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:20,125
Couldn't you see where you were sitting?

687
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:24,791
There's so much space to sit. But you had to sit on me.

688
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:26,750
Are the police looking for you? - Hey..

689
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:30,291
Don't look too amazed...or else I'll pluck them out..

690
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:32,333
..and play 'Pirchot' (marbles).

691
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:34,083
Bunch of fools.

692
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:37,500
You ruined my clothes.

693
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,500
What's 'Pirchot' madam?

694
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:46,666
Don't look at my bag?

695
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:50,458
Oh, God!

696
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:53,083
Look at what those rascals did.

697
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:56,500
Curse that Gustad and his sycophants.

698
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,541
May their clothes get stolen in winter?

699
00:44:00,041 --> 00:44:01,541
May they all fall off a cliff.

700
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:04,083
And become cripples. - Enough!

701
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:07,958
They ruined my Pappu's garage. - It's alright.

702
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:09,500
Gollu's scooter.

703
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,625
Listen to me. It's made of tin after all.

704
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:14,666
We'll all lend a hand... and rebuild it in a day or two.

705
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:16,083
Right?

706
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:17,250
What?

707
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:18,958
Why didn't I think of that?

708
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:20,458
That's a good thing.

709
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:22,333
Bless you, son.

710
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:23,583
Won't it look nice..

711
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:26,708
..if this garage is rebuilt before Pappu returns.

712
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:29,041
Hey leader, don't just stand there.

713
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:30,208
Come on, start cleaning.

714
00:44:30,708 --> 00:44:32,458
Get in. - What did you say?

715
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:34,916
Is he hard of hearing?

716
00:44:35,416 --> 00:44:37,083
Pour some kerosene in your ear and light a match.

717
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:40,000
It will clear your ears and your mind.

718
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,500
Get cleaning.

719
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,666
Come closer..

720
00:44:43,166 --> 00:44:45,833
Clean up the place quickly. Did you hear?

721
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:47,291
Good for nothing.

722
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:49,875
I'll go arrange for the tins.

723
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:54,500
Brother...doesn't she speak a lot?

724
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,875
You're worse. - Fine.

725
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:00,500
She's invited her own death.

726
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,500
Start cleaning... and I will take care of her.

727
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:11,291
See you, Mr. Ramesh. - Bye.

728
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:12,291
We will miss you. - Okay.

729
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:16,500
I will write to you.. - Let's go.

730
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,375
Wretch!

731
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:20,916
You should've killed your mother..

732
00:45:21,416 --> 00:45:25,708
..before robbing your own house and humiliating me.

733
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:29,500
So that someone would've heard my sighs..

734
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
..in those pits of hell.

735
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:38,000
My dear old over-emotional mother.

736
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,291
Try to understand.

737
00:45:39,791 --> 00:45:43,500
You would've got me married to some local boy.

738
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,916
Have you seen the boys around here?

739
00:45:48,416 --> 00:45:50,708
They make you puke.

740
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:52,375
Your father belongs to this place as well.

741
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,500
Yeah, I never said he looked like Hrithik Roshan.

742
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:55,833
Shut up, wretch.

743
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:57,125
You will be the one jealous..

744
00:45:57,625 --> 00:46:01,500
..when I marry some TV or film star.

745
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,500
Oh God! These rascals followed me all the way here.

746
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
What rascals? - You don't worry.

747
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,916
Stop blabbering... I'm hanging up.

748
00:46:08,416 --> 00:46:09,500
Hey man...you can drink your tea.

749
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,500
Madam..

750
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,875
This call cannot be completed, please try after some time.

751
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:24,875
Oh, God.

752
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:27,208
Don't be so lazy.

753
00:46:27,708 --> 00:46:29,625
That is not how you sweep. Let go.

754
00:46:30,125 --> 00:46:31,625
Like this.. This is how you sweep.

755
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:33,666
Go ahead. Already tired.

756
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,041
I am sure you troubled your mother a lot..

757
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:36,208
..when you were a kid.

758
00:46:36,708 --> 00:46:39,125
Poor mother must be running behind you with a glass of milk.

759
00:46:39,625 --> 00:46:42,791
Saying "Drink your milk, or you won't grow strong".

760
00:46:43,291 --> 00:46:44,583
But who listens to his mother, right?

761
00:46:45,083 --> 00:46:48,583
Mothers are crazy, right?

762
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,541
What are you staring at?

763
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:56,791
I can pin you down with two slaps.

764
00:46:57,291 --> 00:46:58,166
Useless..

765
00:46:58,666 --> 00:46:59,875
Working like he's intoxicated.

766
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:04,125
Give that to me, I'll separate those.

767
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:07,541
Not like that. Can't you give it quickly?

768
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:08,666
Come on, follow me.

769
00:47:09,166 --> 00:47:10,583
We'll separate it together.

770
00:47:11,083 --> 00:47:11,958
If we mix this with the garbage..

771
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:14,291
..it won't be worth throwing in the jungle.

772
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:15,375
You would've learnt everything..

773
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,166
..if you had ever been to school.

774
00:47:17,666 --> 00:47:19,625
I never went to school..

775
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:21,000
Ramanna.

776
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,000
Babli aunty?

777
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,833
Babli aunty, do you need anything? - No.

778
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:26,375
Everything is okay.

779
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:28,333
Come to my shop, I'll make tea for you.

780
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:33,000
Okay.

781
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:37,000
Hurry up, everyone, I'll get tea for all of you.

782
00:47:41,166 --> 00:47:42,833
Hello.

783
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:44,333
Hello. - Hello.

784
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:48,416
Hello, son. Did you reach safely? - Yes, we did.

785
00:47:48,916 --> 00:47:50,375
Are you okay? Are you alright?

786
00:47:50,875 --> 00:47:52,083
If those goons trouble you..

787
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:54,375
..I'll come back right now and break their bones.

788
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:57,416
Calm down. What can happen to me?

789
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:58,833
I am absolutely fine.

790
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:00,750
And why are you calling them goons?

791
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:02,666
They are good people.

792
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:05,583
Come here... Come on... come sit on my head.

793
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,041
Give me space to breathe.

794
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:08,666
What happened, mom?

795
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:11,500
Mom, are you alright. - It's nothing.

796
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,583
How about you? - Mom, look after yourself.

797
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:17,750
Close the windows when you sleep at night. - What?

798
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,500
And during the day..

799
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,166
Don't go out at all.

800
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:28,041
Wear a helmet during the day.

801
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:29,333
Helmet?

802
00:48:29,833 --> 00:48:31,541
Son, what's wrong?

803
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:33,625
What has happened?

804
00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:38,291
I can't tell you yet, mom. But, I will tell you later.

805
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:39,958
I'm hanging up now.

806
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:43,458
Look after yourself.

807
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:47,458
Hello.

808
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:55,500
Useless..

809
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,500
Brother, the old hag survived because of that cop.

810
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,916
Why did you keep it here?

811
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:22,500
That rascal said we need to detonate the bomb.

812
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,083
Brother, he didn't say where.

813
00:49:27,583 --> 00:49:29,333
We'll detonate it in an empty space.

814
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:34,333
We'll detonate the bomb, and no one will be harmed.

815
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:37,791
You say such nice things.

816
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:40,083
You're a grown up now.

817
00:49:40,583 --> 00:49:44,083
Note it down.

818
00:49:53,166 --> 00:49:56,666
"Gollu...Pappu.."

819
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:08,625
Let's go.

820
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:17,541
Yes!

821
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:35,583
Gollu... - Yes!

822
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:39,541
Where are we going? - Not us, the train's moving.

823
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:42,041
Train!

824
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:45,583
Chain!

825
00:50:46,083 --> 00:50:47,166
"Gollu...Pappu.."

826
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:49,708
Let's go.

827
00:50:50,208 --> 00:50:55,500
Hey boy, did you pull the chain?

828
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,916
No...it was some uncle.

829
00:50:58,416 --> 00:50:59,583
Do I look like an uncle? - Hey boy..

830
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:03,041
You like pulling chains, don't you?

831
00:51:03,541 --> 00:51:06,125
Hey cop...why are you bothering the kids?

832
00:51:06,625 --> 00:51:07,500
I know them, let them go.

833
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,500
Are you the Prime Minister that we let them go?

834
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,708
Who are you?

835
00:51:13,208 --> 00:51:15,416
I am not the Prime Minister.

836
00:51:15,916 --> 00:51:17,458
But I was...this.

837
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:20,083
Jai Hind, sir. - Hurry up now, get the train moving.

838
00:51:20,583 --> 00:51:21,708
Yes, sir. - Go on.

839
00:51:22,208 --> 00:51:23,000
Go on. Go..

840
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,625
What are you two doing outside?

841
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:29,083
Come in. Come on.

842
00:51:29,583 --> 00:51:32,375
Come on.

843
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:34,333
Hey, listen..

844
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:38,625
Won't you get your suitcase? - Yes, uncle.

845
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:42,208
This suitcase is such a menace.

846
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:45,375
Come on.

847
00:51:45,875 --> 00:51:48,458
Hurry up, the train won't wait for us.

848
00:51:48,958 --> 00:51:52,458
Hurry up. Come on.

849
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:57,791
Brother, I can't reach those two.

850
00:51:58,291 --> 00:52:01,916
There's was an explosion in the city today..

851
00:52:02,416 --> 00:52:05,333
Of a spectacular Sari sale.

852
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:06,541
So don't just sit there..

853
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,958
Brother, could they be cops? They even know our hideout.

854
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:12,333
What if they bring more force?

855
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:14,875
Shift our location.

856
00:52:15,375 --> 00:52:17,625
I am going to Delhi for two days.

857
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:20,500
No communication with anyone until I don't call.

858
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,916
Don't worry, Gollu. Nothing will go wrong now.

859
00:52:27,416 --> 00:52:30,916
Gollu, bag.. - Bag?

860
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:41,083
Brother, she has seen the bomb.

861
00:52:41,583 --> 00:52:42,541
She will tell the inspector about it.

862
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:46,541
Come on.

863
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:53,833
Come on. This way.

864
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:57,833
Come.

865
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,208
We are in a fine mess, Gollu.

866
00:53:16,708 --> 00:53:17,916
Ticket. - We do.

867
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:21,500
So show me. - Why? Haven't you seen one before?

868
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,333
Stop blabbering.

869
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:25,500
Show me your ticket.

870
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,916
Otherwise I'll make you get off this train.

871
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:28,541
You can't make us get off.

872
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:30,791
Show some respect or we'll get off ourselves.

873
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:35,791
Right. - What's going on here?

874
00:53:36,291 --> 00:53:38,166
You two? What now?

875
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:40,166
They don't have a ticket. - Of course we do.

876
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:41,583
We don't know where we kept it.

877
00:53:42,083 --> 00:53:43,333
And you will never find it.

878
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:44,791
You won't. - It's not even in our pockets.

879
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:46,208
You can check it.

880
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:47,500
All our pockets are empty.

881
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,333
Maybe it's in the suitcase.

882
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:51,000
Suitcase? No?

883
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,500
Hand it to me. - We've lost the key.

884
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,083
The ticket's not in this. - Give it.

885
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:59,333
Come on.

886
00:53:59,833 --> 00:54:01,708
I've opened many locks.

887
00:54:02,208 --> 00:54:03,500
Let me take a look.

888
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,708
I've a master-key for all locks.

889
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:07,875
See.

890
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:09,833
This one..

891
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:10,916
This is too big, it won't fit.

892
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:13,958
Hold it.

893
00:54:14,458 --> 00:54:17,958
See...this one.

894
00:54:21,916 --> 00:54:25,416
Here goes...

895
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:31,583
And...

896
00:54:34,125 --> 00:54:37,333
"Gollu...Pappu."

897
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:38,958
Run, Pappu! Run!

898
00:54:39,458 --> 00:54:43,041
Don't think just run! Where did they go?

899
00:54:43,541 --> 00:54:47,083
Don't let go, just run.. - Stop.

900
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:51,166
Another word from you, and I'll throw you out.

901
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:54,583
I knew it... you don't have a ticket.

902
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:58,958
Now pay the penalty... up to Delhi.

903
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:02,958
Delhi?

904
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:13,458
Madam...

905
00:55:13,958 --> 00:55:17,291
Madam...we've reached Delhi. Get off the train.

906
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:19,375
Let's go.

907
00:55:19,875 --> 00:55:23,375
Hail Goddess!

908
00:55:27,708 --> 00:55:29,541
My bag.

909
00:55:30,041 --> 00:55:32,083
Where's my bag?

910
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:34,666
My bag's been stolen.

911
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:38,500
Hey, rascals...where's my bag?

912
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,375
Run, she'll get us arrested. - Thief.

913
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:43,291
Stop you scoundrels.

914
00:55:43,791 --> 00:55:44,458
Thief.

915
00:55:44,958 --> 00:55:47,208
Thieves. Stop. Where are you going?

916
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:50,750
Gollu, run. - Why are we always running?

917
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:53,208
What?

918
00:55:53,708 --> 00:55:56,583
Cash, bag and jewelry were stolen.

919
00:55:57,083 --> 00:56:00,625
This means...the dark shadows of ruination has entered your life.

920
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:02,541
Mom, stop being dramatic and..

921
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:05,333
..remember our acquaintance Delhi, Mr. Sonaram.

922
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:07,791
Who? - The same guy who owns a shop in the mall.

923
00:56:08,291 --> 00:56:09,875
Yes. Do you have his address?

924
00:56:10,375 --> 00:56:11,875
Yes, I do. Uncle.

925
00:56:12,375 --> 00:56:14,708
Tell Guddu to text it to me.

926
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:16,541
Once I get a place to stay..

927
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:21,416
..I'll catch those rascals really soon.

928
00:56:21,916 --> 00:56:25,458
"They're carefree good for nothing guys."

929
00:56:25,958 --> 00:56:29,666
"They make possible... impossible."

930
00:56:30,166 --> 00:56:33,333
"They're carefree good for nothing guys."

931
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:37,833
"They make possible... impossible."

932
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:42,000
"They think they are smarty, but be advised."

933
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:46,000
"They are very overdramatic."

934
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,375
"Stop it now."

935
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:53,208
"Don't trouble me anymore."

936
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:55,500
"Mind your own business."

937
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,500
"Spare the people."

938
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,375
"Stop it now."

939
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,458
"Don't trouble me anymore."

940
00:57:01,958 --> 00:57:03,583
"Mind your own business."

941
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:06,375
"Spare the people."

942
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:07,958
"Gollu...Pappu."

943
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:10,541
Come, sit.

944
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:14,166
"What's wrong with you, don't try to be too smart."

945
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:17,166
"Gollu.."

946
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:21,125
"Pappu.."

947
00:57:21,625 --> 00:57:22,791
Take the luggage inside.

948
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:23,916
Hello, madam.

949
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:27,166
Pandey, shell out the money.

950
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:29,541
Here!

951
00:57:30,041 --> 00:57:32,333
What's this? - 5 rupees.

952
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:34,666
3 rupees for tea, you'll still have 2 rupees left.

953
00:57:35,166 --> 00:57:35,916
You can return that tomorrow.

954
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:38,708
I trust you. - I will slap you..

955
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:41,958
Your phone's ringing.

956
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:44,916
Who's calling me now? - Yes, Mr. Sharma.

957
00:57:45,416 --> 00:57:46,291
Hello, Shalini madam.

958
00:57:46,791 --> 00:57:49,083
I have wonderful news for you.

959
00:57:49,583 --> 00:57:53,416
Gustad and his men are coming to Pacific mall, in your city.

960
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:55,791
This is your best chance to catch them.

961
00:57:56,291 --> 00:57:58,333
Catch Gustad, and you'll definitely get 5 million.

962
00:57:58,833 --> 00:58:00,000
And if you catch his accomplices..

963
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:03,000
..then it'll be my responsibility to get you back here.

964
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:08,208
Mr. Sharma...first time you gave me such a sweet news.

965
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:11,458
I would've definitely kissed you.

966
00:58:11,958 --> 00:58:13,333
Madam, you're getting quite naughty.

967
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:17,166
Whether it's Gustad or his men, they won't escape me.

968
00:58:17,666 --> 00:58:19,333
I've to return father's 4 million.

969
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:20,958
Understand? Okay, bye.

970
00:58:21,458 --> 00:58:23,625
Come on, take me to Pacific mall.

971
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:26,500
Why did you come out so soon? - It was a horrible movie.

972
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,291
Total flop. - You could've enjoyed a little.

973
00:58:28,791 --> 00:58:30,458
Enjoyed? The theatre was completely empty.

974
00:58:30,958 --> 00:58:32,500
Not a single guy in there. - That's okay.

975
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,500
You should've seen it alone, enjoyed the special treatment.

976
00:58:42,291 --> 00:58:47,458
Where did you get the tea?

977
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:49,958
Excuse me, ma'am. Get in the line. - Excuse me.

978
00:58:50,458 --> 00:58:51,500
Madam, please get in the line.

979
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,666
That crazy man was saying something.

980
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:56,125
How dare you? Do you know who I am?

981
00:58:56,625 --> 00:58:58,750
If you come more frequently to my house, I'll know who you are.

982
00:58:59,250 --> 00:58:59,625
Shut up.

983
00:59:00,125 --> 00:59:01,000
I came here to perform in a dance show.

984
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:05,000
I can't stand in the line and embarrass myself.

985
00:59:30,666 --> 00:59:31,500
You did the right thing, dear.

986
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,958
Keep this money.

987
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:34,500
No, uncle. - Keep it, dear.

988
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,708
No.. - Keep it, dear, I already talked to your mother.

989
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:39,333
You will never find your purse in this huge city.

990
00:59:39,833 --> 00:59:40,833
Buy some clothes for yourself.

991
00:59:41,333 --> 00:59:42,708
And then you can come back to the shop. Okay.

992
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:46,041
I'll call your aunty as well. We'll eat together, dear. - Okay.

993
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:48,833
Thank you, uncle. - Okay.

994
00:59:49,333 --> 00:59:51,083
Gollu, we've 7 minutes.

995
00:59:51,583 --> 00:59:55,458
Exactly at 7 o'clock. - Mansi.

996
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:59,458
Mansi.

997
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:04,541
Mansi.

998
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:06,500
Brother, get him out of here.

999
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,583
Or he'll get blown up.

1000
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:09,875
Come on. - Come.

1001
01:00:10,375 --> 01:00:13,750
Mister, why are you crying?

1002
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,291
Mansi bhen and Dhirubhai are getting married.

1003
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:18,041
No one can get them married. No one.

1004
01:00:18,541 --> 01:00:19,625
They are getting married.

1005
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:21,750
Could be anyone.

1006
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:23,875
No...

1007
01:00:24,375 --> 01:00:26,541
Mansi isn't Dhirubhai's sister.

1008
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:28,500
They just came on date today.

1009
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:29,583
Date?

1010
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:32,208
It's not poor Mansi's fault, right?

1011
01:00:32,708 --> 01:00:37,916
I couldn't tell her how much I love her.

1012
01:00:38,416 --> 01:00:40,291
Well...

1013
01:00:40,791 --> 01:00:42,500
I will kill myself.

1014
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,458
Die.. - If you stay here any longer..

1015
01:00:44,958 --> 01:00:45,541
..you will definitely die.

1016
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:47,500
You love her, don't you? So just tell her.

1017
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,333
That's exactly what I couldn't tell her.

1018
01:00:49,833 --> 01:00:51,125
I tried so hard.

1019
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:53,166
You can't tell her, can you?

1020
01:00:53,666 --> 01:00:54,375
So write a letter.

1021
01:00:54,875 --> 01:00:56,166
And throw it towards her.

1022
01:00:56,666 --> 01:00:58,583
If it gets to her, then your love is true.

1023
01:00:59,083 --> 01:00:59,875
And if it doesn't, then..

1024
01:01:00,375 --> 01:01:03,958
..she was never meant to be yours. That's it.

1025
01:01:04,458 --> 01:01:07,958
He's right.

1026
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,666
Brother...you're right.

1027
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:13,791
Not a bad idea.

1028
01:01:14,291 --> 01:01:16,583
I'll go right now. Mansi! Mansi!

1029
01:01:17,083 --> 01:01:18,125
Do I look fat?

1030
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:19,458
Note it.

1031
01:01:19,958 --> 01:01:21,541
We did nothing to get beaten up.

1032
01:01:22,041 --> 01:01:24,625
I only asked for my right. - Yes, we will ask for our right.

1033
01:01:25,125 --> 01:01:26,083
No one goes out of this mall..

1034
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:28,083
..until our demands aren't fulfilled.

1035
01:01:28,583 --> 01:01:30,833
Dear customers, your attention please.

1036
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:32,208
There's been a riot between..

1037
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:35,041
..the rickshaw driver's union and the commuters in our area.

1038
01:01:35,541 --> 01:01:37,666
And by the order of the Commissioner of Police..

1039
01:01:38,166 --> 01:01:43,166
..for your safety and the mall's all the doors have been closed for a while.

1040
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:47,208
We've also organized a free show in screen no.2..

1041
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:49,750
..on behalf of the multiplex.

1042
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:53,958
Brother!

1043
01:01:54,458 --> 01:01:57,958
Mister...

1044
01:02:15,916 --> 01:02:18,791
Come on.

1045
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:21,500
Excuse me.

1046
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:22,541
Excuse me.

1047
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:26,541
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1048
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:35,458
Brother...

1049
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:42,541
Gollu...

1050
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:46,500
Where's the suitcase?

1051
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,458
"Eeny, meeny, miny, moe."

1052
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:52,458
"Catch a thief by the toe."

1053
01:02:52,958 --> 01:02:54,625
"If he hollers, let him go."

1054
01:02:55,125 --> 01:03:01,583
"The thief's stolen the suitcase."

1055
01:03:02,083 --> 01:03:03,583
What are you looking for, mister?

1056
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:06,083
How do you know we're looking for something? - Yes.

1057
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:07,583
Is this some kind of a joke?

1058
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:09,625
Did you see a brown color suitcase here?

1059
01:03:10,125 --> 01:03:11,458
We just lost ours. - Brown color?

1060
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:13,916
Yes, I did. I man just took it with him.

1061
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:15,583
I saw him go out myself.

1062
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:16,958
Come here. - What's wrong?

1063
01:03:17,458 --> 01:03:20,166
Did you see his face? - No, mister. I didn't.

1064
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:23,791
Then how do you know he was a man? - Yeah!

1065
01:03:24,291 --> 01:03:25,000
What a strange question.

1066
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,458
I never saw a dog take a suitcase in his jaw.

1067
01:03:28,958 --> 01:03:29,458
Strange.

1068
01:03:29,958 --> 01:03:30,625
Hold on.

1069
01:03:31,125 --> 01:03:33,041
How do you know that was our suitcase?

1070
01:03:33,541 --> 01:03:35,791
He just said he lost his brown color suitcase.

1071
01:03:36,291 --> 01:03:37,500
I did tell him.

1072
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,875
If I tell you I'm missing something..

1073
01:03:41,375 --> 01:03:43,750
..can you tell us who took it? - Brother, you..

1074
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:47,416
Four days ago I put my yellow underwear outside to dry..

1075
01:03:47,916 --> 01:03:48,625
..and then it went missing.

1076
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,250
So who took it?

1077
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:52,750
We don't have time to talk.

1078
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:55,416
Please...spare me..

1079
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:57,375
I don't know who took your brown color suitcase.

1080
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:58,541
I don't know who took your brown suitcase.

1081
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:01,958
Spare me. - Then don't waste our time.

1082
01:04:02,458 --> 01:04:04,500
Gollu, I knew this man can't be trusted..

1083
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,250
..when he gave an example of the dog.

1084
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:09,916
Brother, the suitcase? - Where is it?

1085
01:04:10,416 --> 01:04:13,791
"Eeny, meeny, miny, moe."

1086
01:04:14,291 --> 01:04:15,833
"Catch a thief by the toe."

1087
01:04:16,333 --> 01:04:17,875
"If he hollers, let him go."

1088
01:04:18,375 --> 01:04:21,875
"The thief's stolen the suitcase."

1089
01:04:26,125 --> 01:04:27,750
Gollu, let's go. - But the suitcase.

1090
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:30,500
How can we find it in this huge place?

1091
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,375
We'll have to get out.

1092
01:04:32,875 --> 01:04:36,375
Do you want to get blown up?

1093
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:06,583
He'll get us killed..

1094
01:05:07,083 --> 01:05:08,916
What are you doing? - No, brother, you go out.

1095
01:05:09,416 --> 01:05:10,500
I am not coming. - Why?

1096
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,625
I want to find the suitcase and defuse the bomb.

1097
01:05:13,125 --> 01:05:13,750
Are you crazy?

1098
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:17,000
You want to risk your life for these strangers.

1099
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,333
Brother, if anything happens to them..

1100
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,083
..then we'll be cursing ourselves all our life.

1101
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:22,125
I can't live like that.

1102
01:05:22,625 --> 01:05:23,125
And if we don't get out..

1103
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:25,375
..we won't be alive to curse ourselves.

1104
01:05:25,875 --> 01:05:29,083
Who will look after mom? - Who says we're going to die.

1105
01:05:29,583 --> 01:05:31,208
We'll find the suitcase and diffuse the bomb.

1106
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:32,333
I assure you.

1107
01:05:32,833 --> 01:05:34,416
And what if we don't find it.

1108
01:05:34,916 --> 01:05:37,125
Let's do one thing.

1109
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:40,625
The bomb will explode in 45 minutes.

1110
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:43,625
Let's try to locate the bomb in 30 minutes.

1111
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:46,041
If we find it, we switch it off.

1112
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:48,541
If we don't, then we'll consider it..

1113
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:51,541
..the grace of God and get out of here.

1114
01:05:52,041 --> 01:05:53,916
Say yes, brother.

1115
01:05:54,416 --> 01:05:59,041
You...will get us killed.

1116
01:05:59,541 --> 01:06:03,625
Fine.

1117
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:07,541
As you say.

1118
01:06:08,041 --> 01:06:11,541
But where will we look for it?

1119
01:06:16,208 --> 01:06:18,625
Hello, Mr...Police. - Pandey.

1120
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:20,458
Have you seen our brother?

1121
01:06:20,958 --> 01:06:23,583
He's carrying a brown color suitcase. - We got to find him.

1122
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:25,958
Why? - Yes. We have to find our brother.

1123
01:06:26,458 --> 01:06:27,458
He's the only son.

1124
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:31,958
He's tall and.. - Hold on.

1125
01:06:32,458 --> 01:06:33,583
Tell me something.

1126
01:06:34,083 --> 01:06:38,041
If your brother is the only son of your parents..

1127
01:06:38,541 --> 01:06:41,750
..then what are you two?

1128
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:43,333
Brother..

1129
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,541
Who are you to comment on our family?

1130
01:06:46,041 --> 01:06:47,166
Just answer the question.

1131
01:06:47,666 --> 01:06:49,291
Did you see our brother? Did you see our brother?

1132
01:06:49,791 --> 01:06:51,500
What's going on?

1133
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,333
You two!

1134
01:06:53,833 --> 01:06:54,875
Pandey, I know these two.

1135
01:06:55,375 --> 01:06:56,250
Pardon them.

1136
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:59,625
Never misbehave with the police.

1137
01:07:00,125 --> 01:07:01,208
They won't. They won't.

1138
01:07:01,708 --> 01:07:02,833
Pandey...

1139
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:06,708
Sir, you. - You two have come to the right place.

1140
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:08,708
I am the security in-charge of this mall.

1141
01:07:09,208 --> 01:07:12,708
This is fun!

1142
01:07:16,083 --> 01:07:16,833
What's wrong?

1143
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,791
Come on, hit me...so he can figure out that something is wrong.

1144
01:07:20,291 --> 01:07:22,708
What's wrong?

1145
01:07:23,208 --> 01:07:25,416
Mr. Puri, what did you figure out so far?

1146
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:27,208
That we've lost our suitcase..

1147
01:07:27,708 --> 01:07:31,333
..or that there's a bomb in our suitcase? - Huh!

1148
01:07:31,833 --> 01:07:33,125
Bomb? - Bomb!

1149
01:07:33,625 --> 01:07:34,750
Puri sir, don't get too emotional.

1150
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:38,750
It doesn't belong to us. We just came to detonate it.

1151
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:50,291
Look brothers... if you two have planted a bomb here..

1152
01:07:50,791 --> 01:07:55,208
..then, I've a missile.

1153
01:07:55,708 --> 01:07:59,041
Cute children..

1154
01:07:59,541 --> 01:08:00,750
That rascal Gustad..

1155
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:02,458
How many more mothers has he abducted..

1156
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:07,541
..and forced their sons to do his evil deed?

1157
01:08:08,041 --> 01:08:09,958
Boys...hurry up.

1158
01:08:10,458 --> 01:08:11,625
Faster.

1159
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:15,541
And remember don't cut any tree with fruits.

1160
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:22,375
Look for sesame trees, ones that have dried up.

1161
01:08:22,875 --> 01:08:26,375
This will be right.

1162
01:08:33,833 --> 01:08:35,583
What's this?

1163
01:08:36,083 --> 01:08:37,708
Gun. - I can see that too.

1164
01:08:38,208 --> 01:08:39,750
Where did you get it?

1165
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,333
I'll slap you.. - I found it lying here.

1166
01:08:42,833 --> 01:08:44,208
Then keep it back.

1167
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:45,833
I wanted to show you.

1168
01:08:46,333 --> 01:08:47,833
Don't you ever touch these things again.

1169
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:50,500
Keep it down. Come on. And hide it.

1170
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,541
Hide it. - Fine. Fine.

1171
01:08:54,041 --> 01:08:55,958
Down!

1172
01:08:56,458 --> 01:08:58,541
What now? - Shut up you oaf.

1173
01:08:59,041 --> 01:09:00,250
Did you hear anything? - No!

1174
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:02,875
Clear your ears.

1175
01:09:03,375 --> 01:09:04,250
I could hear voices.

1176
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:07,458
This is Gustad's area. His men have been spotted in this area.

1177
01:09:07,958 --> 01:09:09,166
Be quiet.

1178
01:09:09,666 --> 01:09:13,375
Now follow me...but quietly.

1179
01:09:13,875 --> 01:09:17,375
Like this...lie low.

1180
01:09:23,083 --> 01:09:26,583
Hands in the front, and lie down.

1181
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:31,875
So it's you. - Aunty, you?

1182
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:33,291
But what are you doing here?

1183
01:09:33,791 --> 01:09:35,375
Pappu's garage was blown up.

1184
01:09:35,875 --> 01:09:36,750
So I came looking for wood to fix it.

1185
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:38,750
And these men?

1186
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:41,625
Do you want to see their identification?

1187
01:09:42,125 --> 01:09:44,041
Isn't it enough that they're with me? - Yes, aunty.

1188
01:09:44,541 --> 01:09:49,208
They are my kin... Just like my children!

1189
01:09:49,708 --> 01:09:50,833
You can all go.

1190
01:09:51,333 --> 01:09:52,625
Go on. - See you later.

1191
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:55,250
Goodbye.

1192
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:57,166
What are you all doing?

1193
01:09:57,666 --> 01:10:02,708
Come on. This way.

1194
01:10:03,208 --> 01:10:06,000
Brother, she called us family!

1195
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:10,000
She called us a kin!

1196
01:10:32,541 --> 01:10:36,041
"Gollu...Pappu...!"

1197
01:10:41,833 --> 01:10:45,333
Move. Move...

1198
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:56,708
Keep playing...

1199
01:11:11,791 --> 01:11:15,291
What's going on?

1200
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:18,541
What's going on?

1201
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:22,541
'Kabaddi!'

1202
01:11:28,041 --> 01:11:29,583
Sorry.

1203
01:11:30,083 --> 01:11:32,041
Excuse us!

1204
01:11:32,541 --> 01:11:34,208
You go that way, I'll go this way.

1205
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:38,208
Okay.

1206
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:50,750
Hello.. - Hello.

1207
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:53,333
Hello...Pappu. - Yes.

1208
01:11:53,833 --> 01:11:55,458
Gustad speaking. - Hello.

1209
01:11:55,958 --> 01:11:58,125
Gustad speaking. - Yes.

1210
01:11:58,625 --> 01:11:59,458
Why was your mobile switched off?

1211
01:11:59,958 --> 01:12:02,000
The battery was dead. I just charged my phone. .

1212
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:03,541
I see..

1213
01:12:04,041 --> 01:12:06,166
Where are you two? What's the news?

1214
01:12:06,666 --> 01:12:07,708
Do you want me to stop everything I'm doing..

1215
01:12:08,208 --> 01:12:08,625
..and give you the news.

1216
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:10,708
Don't you have television at home?

1217
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:13,541
I mean...did you do the job or not?

1218
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:15,250
Yes, we've done half the job.

1219
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:18,083
We've activated the bomb and planted it in place.

1220
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:20,625
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!

1221
01:12:21,125 --> 01:12:22,000
No names!

1222
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,541
Don't call it a bomb.

1223
01:12:24,041 --> 01:12:26,541
Talk in code.

1224
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:30,416
Well...we...we..

1225
01:12:30,916 --> 01:12:33,208
Chunnu, where are you going?

1226
01:12:33,708 --> 01:12:34,625
Chunnu!

1227
01:12:35,125 --> 01:12:36,708
We left Chunnu in place.

1228
01:12:37,208 --> 01:12:39,750
But someone took Chunnu away.

1229
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:44,541
As soon as Chunnu's watch strike's 7, it will puke.

1230
01:12:45,041 --> 01:12:47,250
But we don't know where Chunnu is?

1231
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:49,125
Who is Chunnu? Where did he come from?

1232
01:12:49,625 --> 01:12:54,916
You said I should talk in code.

1233
01:12:55,416 --> 01:12:57,958
Gustad...there's a man coming towards me..

1234
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:00,708
..who looks just like you.

1235
01:13:01,208 --> 01:13:03,291
Hang up! - Huh!

1236
01:13:03,791 --> 01:13:06,625
Hang up!

1237
01:13:07,125 --> 01:13:09,208
Father.. - You.

1238
01:13:09,708 --> 01:13:12,083
Who is she? Muskan - My daughter.

1239
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:14,375
And her? - My wife.

1240
01:13:14,875 --> 01:13:18,833
Hello. - Hello.

1241
01:13:19,333 --> 01:13:26,208
You are really nice.. - By the way, shouldn't you be in Ludhiana instead?

1242
01:13:26,708 --> 01:13:27,708
It's a long story.

1243
01:13:28,208 --> 01:13:30,833
You are here too. You should've been in the jungle.

1244
01:13:31,333 --> 01:13:33,166
Jungle? Father, are you Tazan?

1245
01:13:33,666 --> 01:13:35,208
Dear, you shouldn't say that.

1246
01:13:35,708 --> 01:13:37,125
She's just a kid, she loves these things.

1247
01:13:37,625 --> 01:13:39,625
Super Joe - We deal in Shawls.

1248
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:41,958
That's what we came to deliver in the shops here.

1249
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:44,958
You? - You didn't tell her, Gustad..

1250
01:13:45,458 --> 01:13:47,458
No need to get angry.

1251
01:13:47,958 --> 01:13:51,000
I will talk to them first and then deal with you.

1252
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,208
Come, dear. Please go ahead. - Yes, but..

1253
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:54,916
Bye, uncle. - Continue with your shopping, I'll join you.

1254
01:13:55,416 --> 01:13:56,791
See you later, mister. - See you later, brother

1255
01:13:57,291 --> 01:13:59,833
They are so nice. - What do you want to say?

1256
01:14:00,333 --> 01:14:04,291
What do you want to say? What? Get lost.

1257
01:14:04,791 --> 01:14:06,541
What do you want to say?

1258
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:13,166
That my bomb is going to be a threat to my family.

1259
01:14:13,666 --> 01:14:15,041
Not bomb...Chunnu.

1260
01:14:15,541 --> 01:14:18,291
Pappu?

1261
01:14:18,791 --> 01:14:20,541
What are you doing here?

1262
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:22,500
And why is he holding your collar?

1263
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,625
Hey, madam...what I do with is not your concern..

1264
01:14:27,125 --> 01:14:27,833
..so mind your own business.

1265
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:29,125
I am doing my job.

1266
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:32,458
You cannot threaten someone in front of a police officer.

1267
01:14:32,958 --> 01:14:37,458
Police? - Yes!

1268
01:14:37,958 --> 01:14:42,166
Inspector Shalini Shrivastav.

1269
01:14:42,666 --> 01:14:47,250
Inspector? - What are you doing here?

1270
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:51,583
Why was this man holding your color?

1271
01:14:52,083 --> 01:14:53,750
Pappu, who was he?

1272
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:57,750
Friend. He was a friend. - Friend?

1273
01:15:01,791 --> 01:15:05,291
And you? Police inspector?

1274
01:15:09,291 --> 01:15:12,791
Gollu...

1275
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,833
Love...Love...Love...

1276
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:33,000
Great words...

1277
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,583
Always bring a smile to your face.

1278
01:15:36,083 --> 01:15:38,250
But friends, if an image or a face..

1279
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:41,500
..comes in front of your eyes while saying these words..

1280
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,041
..then that's really great. - Gollu... Gollu...

1281
01:15:43,541 --> 01:15:44,791
Before things get out of your hand..

1282
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:46,166
..just say it.

1283
01:15:46,666 --> 01:15:49,500
Today is the opportunity and excuse too.

1284
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,166
So let's fall in love.

1285
01:15:51,666 --> 01:15:53,333
Let's fall in love again.

1286
01:15:53,833 --> 01:16:00,291
"We two...might become one."

1287
01:16:00,791 --> 01:16:08,041
"We two...might become one."

1288
01:16:08,541 --> 01:16:12,041
"Let's swear never to separate."

1289
01:16:24,416 --> 01:16:31,541
"We two...might become one."

1290
01:16:32,041 --> 01:16:37,500
"Let's swear never to separate."

1291
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,291
'I'll throw this towards here.'

1292
01:16:40,791 --> 01:16:44,291
'If it touches here, then she's mine.'

1293
01:17:05,041 --> 01:17:13,958
"We share a old bond.."

1294
01:17:14,458 --> 01:17:22,708
"You're the color of flowers, the fuel to my heart."

1295
01:17:23,208 --> 01:17:28,250
"The queen of my heart... I wonder when you'll be mine."

1296
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:30,708
Gollu!

1297
01:17:31,208 --> 01:17:31,541
Gollu!

1298
01:17:32,041 --> 01:17:34,500
"I wonder when you'll be mine."

1299
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,875
"We two...might become one."

1300
01:17:39,375 --> 01:17:42,875
It didn't touch her.

1301
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:46,541
Mom, you just lost your daughter-in-law.

1302
01:17:47,041 --> 01:17:51,125
What? - Nothing.

1303
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:53,833
You see her.

1304
01:17:54,333 --> 01:17:57,833
I won't let anything happen to her.

1305
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:07,500
"Let's swear never to separate."

1306
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,208
"Let's swear never to separate."

1307
01:18:12,708 --> 01:18:16,541
Pari ma'am..

1308
01:18:17,041 --> 01:18:21,541
Gollu, your Pari ma'am is a police inspector.

1309
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:23,375
What? - Yes!

1310
01:18:23,875 --> 01:18:28,875
If we tell her anything, we'll be in trouble.

1311
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:35,958
Listen...it's more important that we find the bomb.

1312
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:39,666
You sing really well. - Thank you.

1313
01:18:40,166 --> 01:18:42,166
But you know, Sweety..

1314
01:18:42,666 --> 01:18:44,416
..soon I'll start shooting for my film. - Huh!

1315
01:18:44,916 --> 01:18:46,125
And I am the singer as well.

1316
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:48,500
And also doing action scenes.

1317
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,750
Will action suit me or not?

1318
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:55,375
Come on, touch it.

1319
01:18:55,875 --> 01:18:57,666
Feel it! Feel it!

1320
01:18:58,166 --> 01:19:02,250
Feel it!

1321
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:08,708
Touch it properly, madam...

1322
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:13,208
You dog...rascal... I will break your jaw!

1323
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:15,416
I will break your bones. I won't spare you today.

1324
01:19:15,916 --> 01:19:19,416
I will definitely kill you today. Wait!

1325
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,708
You too? - Yes.

1326
01:19:24,208 --> 01:19:27,791
I am going to follow you everywhere you go.

1327
01:19:28,291 --> 01:19:30,291
Give it back now.. - Well..

1328
01:19:30,791 --> 01:19:35,000
It was in the suitcase, and it's lost now.

1329
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:36,500
Hey, stop.

1330
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:37,708
What do you think?

1331
01:19:38,208 --> 01:19:40,291
Your sad story can make a girl crazy?

1332
01:19:40,791 --> 01:19:42,041
It's clearly written on your face...

1333
01:19:42,541 --> 01:19:46,375
..that your birth was a mistake. - Hey, have you lost your mind?

1334
01:19:46,875 --> 01:19:48,458
We're not liars or thieves.

1335
01:19:48,958 --> 01:19:50,875
We're doing everything for our mom.

1336
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:54,708
Can any son like about his mom?

1337
01:19:55,208 --> 01:19:58,708
I swear on my mom, the suitcase is lost.

1338
01:19:59,208 --> 01:20:02,833
Along with whatever was in it..

1339
01:20:03,333 --> 01:20:05,750
We've been trying to find it.

1340
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:09,750
Believe it if you want, or else..

1341
01:20:19,791 --> 01:20:22,083
Who was that boy?

1342
01:20:22,583 --> 01:20:25,125
So sweet, you're being possessive already.

1343
01:20:25,625 --> 01:20:28,333
I guess it's the first stage of love.

1344
01:20:28,833 --> 01:20:30,083
Actually, I had a bag..

1345
01:20:30,583 --> 01:20:32,791
..which contained 150,000 cash and jewelry.

1346
01:20:33,291 --> 01:20:36,416
If I still had it, I would've already given you dowry in advance.

1347
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:38,583
But that rascal stole it from me.

1348
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:41,375
And someone stole it from that rascal in this mall.

1349
01:20:41,875 --> 01:20:43,791
Now...we need to find that suitcase.

1350
01:20:44,291 --> 01:20:47,250
It contains everything. It's small, brown color...and filthy looking.

1351
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:48,833
We need to find it right now.

1352
01:20:49,333 --> 01:20:51,791
Wow...impressive.

1353
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:54,708
He's already looking for my bag.

1354
01:20:55,208 --> 01:20:58,000
That's what you call a responsible star husband.

1355
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,791
Pari... Madam..

1356
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:02,291
Gollu?

1357
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:06,250
Strange? You're here too. - Yes.

1358
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:08,291
Well I..

1359
01:21:08,791 --> 01:21:10,666
Please go home soon. .

1360
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:13,000
Someone's waiting for you. Come on.

1361
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:14,916
Someone's waiting for me at home? - Yes.

1362
01:21:15,416 --> 01:21:16,583
Who? - Me..

1363
01:21:17,083 --> 01:21:18,958
I met someone. Come on.

1364
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:22,500
He was saying...I've to meet inspector Shalini madam.

1365
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I asked him to go home, I'll inform her.

1366
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:28,500
Someone was asking for me? - Yes.

1367
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,958
In this mall? - Yes.

1368
01:21:31,458 --> 01:21:34,500
Did Sharma.. - No, his name wasn't Sharma.

1369
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,458
But why was he asking you about me?

1370
01:21:38,958 --> 01:21:41,541
He knows that I know you're here.

1371
01:21:42,041 --> 01:21:44,458
How does he know that you know I am here?

1372
01:21:44,958 --> 01:21:47,916
I told him that I did.

1373
01:21:48,416 --> 01:21:49,250
Look...all you need to know..

1374
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:51,333
..is that someone was asking for you, okay.

1375
01:21:51,833 --> 01:21:53,958
There? - Yes, somewhere there...in that direction.

1376
01:21:54,458 --> 01:21:56,416
'Rascal...he's informing the police.'

1377
01:21:56,916 --> 01:21:57,416
Listen...

1378
01:21:57,916 --> 01:21:58,833
Go back inside. - What happened?

1379
01:21:59,333 --> 01:22:00,208
Don't come out.

1380
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:01,583
Mom, what's wrong with father?

1381
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:03,958
That man can't go anywhere, let's find him.

1382
01:22:04,458 --> 01:22:05,500
Look, Gollu. The gates are closed.

1383
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,916
That man must be here, somewhere. - But madam..

1384
01:22:08,416 --> 01:22:09,791
Inform me as soon as you see him.

1385
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:11,750
Okay.

1386
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:15,750
Madam!

1387
01:22:20,041 --> 01:22:20,750
Why do we have to get out of here?

1388
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:22,708
Where are we going? - Don't question me, Saira. - Father.

1389
01:22:23,208 --> 01:22:27,250
Just do as I say.

1390
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:28,708
The situation outside is really terrible.

1391
01:22:29,208 --> 01:22:29,708
Don't open the gates at all.

1392
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:30,708
Excuse me. - Yes.

1393
01:22:31,208 --> 01:22:32,791
Are you the security in-charge? - Yes.

1394
01:22:33,291 --> 01:22:35,041
Please open the gate and let us out.

1395
01:22:35,541 --> 01:22:37,041
I overheard two boys talking.

1396
01:22:37,541 --> 01:22:38,875
They have a bomb. - Bomb?

1397
01:22:39,375 --> 01:22:39,833
Why didn't you tell us before?

1398
01:22:40,333 --> 01:22:41,125
Dear, please go there.

1399
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:43,416
Look, open that gate right now.

1400
01:22:43,916 --> 01:22:44,708
And let us out.

1401
01:22:45,208 --> 01:22:47,375
You heard two boys talking. - Yes.

1402
01:22:47,875 --> 01:22:49,208
Gollu and Pappu? - Yes.

1403
01:22:49,708 --> 01:22:52,500
I already had a word with them. I know.

1404
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,291
They were just joking.

1405
01:22:54,791 --> 01:22:56,333
Where will they get a bomb?

1406
01:22:56,833 --> 01:22:59,083
They have a bomb! How can you be so sure?

1407
01:22:59,583 --> 01:23:00,125
Abdul!

1408
01:23:00,625 --> 01:23:02,958
Abdul, how can you be so certain?

1409
01:23:03,458 --> 01:23:05,083
If he's saying it's a hoax, then I believe him.

1410
01:23:05,583 --> 01:23:08,708
They are nave kids, they have no bomb.

1411
01:23:09,208 --> 01:23:11,958
Maybe some terrorist gave them one.

1412
01:23:12,458 --> 01:23:14,291
Would any terrorist be so stupid..

1413
01:23:14,791 --> 01:23:16,541
..to give these fools a bomb?

1414
01:23:17,041 --> 01:23:19,291
Only a big oaf.. - Maybe?

1415
01:23:19,791 --> 01:23:20,583
Why not?

1416
01:23:21,083 --> 01:23:22,833
We can't take a chance.

1417
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:25,375
You're being so stubborn. Just forget it.

1418
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:28,666
Saira, don't interfere. - Well...

1419
01:23:29,166 --> 01:23:32,666
You sound like you gave them the bomb.

1420
01:23:33,166 --> 01:23:34,166
Yes.. - What?

1421
01:23:34,666 --> 01:23:38,125
Yes, fine. If you're assured, then they don't have a bomb.

1422
01:23:38,625 --> 01:23:39,666
They can't have a bomb.

1423
01:23:40,166 --> 01:23:42,750
It's okay.. - How can they have a bomb?

1424
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:45,166
Get him a cup of tea.. - You're right.

1425
01:23:45,666 --> 01:23:47,916
This is..

1426
01:23:48,416 --> 01:23:49,541
You're right. - Muskan.. - Yes, mom.

1427
01:23:50,041 --> 01:23:50,416
Father..

1428
01:23:50,916 --> 01:23:52,958
You're absolutely right.

1429
01:23:53,458 --> 01:23:56,958
I know!

1430
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,333
This...is a plane-letter.

1431
01:24:13,833 --> 01:24:14,666
Brother..

1432
01:24:15,166 --> 01:24:17,041
Brother.. - Not now.

1433
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:20,583
Then when?

1434
01:24:21,083 --> 01:24:22,250
Brother.. Then when?

1435
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:23,666
I threw this so many times..

1436
01:24:24,166 --> 01:24:26,000
..but every time it touches someone else.

1437
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:30,000
Consider them your destiny.

1438
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:33,791
No, no, no, no...

1439
01:24:34,291 --> 01:24:35,083
Brother..

1440
01:24:35,583 --> 01:24:36,500
Brother..

1441
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,291
Brother, something's wrong with the plane.

1442
01:24:38,791 --> 01:24:39,416
Nothing's wrong with the plane.

1443
01:24:39,916 --> 01:24:40,791
Brother..

1444
01:24:41,291 --> 01:24:42,833
If your love's true, then it will touch her.

1445
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:47,500
She is not your destiny.. - Brother!

1446
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,708
Brother, please.

1447
01:24:50,208 --> 01:24:53,041
Just keep at it, please.

1448
01:24:53,541 --> 01:24:55,833
Brother...

1449
01:24:56,333 --> 01:24:59,833
Gollu!

1450
01:25:02,458 --> 01:25:05,958
Hold on. Sit!

1451
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:14,583
Mansi..

1452
01:25:15,083 --> 01:25:17,333
I'll deal with it.

1453
01:25:17,833 --> 01:25:20,833
Hide. Hide, Gollu.

1454
01:25:21,333 --> 01:25:24,500
What's this? - This...

1455
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,041
Do you love me?

1456
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:30,250
Yes or no? - Yes!

1457
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:34,250
Stupid, I was waiting for you to confess.

1458
01:25:47,791 --> 01:25:49,291
Like my mom says.

1459
01:25:49,791 --> 01:25:52,416
One doesn't have to do a good deed.

1460
01:25:52,916 --> 01:25:56,416
If there's love in the heart, it just happens.

1461
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,583
Brother.. Brother, thank you.

1462
01:26:05,083 --> 01:26:06,833
It's time to take your medicine.

1463
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:09,291
I wonder when they're going to open the gates.

1464
01:26:09,791 --> 01:26:11,375
I'll go get your medicine.

1465
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:13,916
What's the worst that can happen? I will die.

1466
01:26:14,416 --> 01:26:16,958
Then all the gates will open. Of heaven, and the mall..

1467
01:26:17,458 --> 01:26:18,708
Enough.

1468
01:26:19,208 --> 01:26:20,208
I'll get your medicine. - Fine.

1469
01:26:20,708 --> 01:26:24,666
Get my medicine.

1470
01:26:25,166 --> 01:26:28,666
Hello..

1471
01:26:31,083 --> 01:26:32,458
Help! Uncle's falling.

1472
01:26:32,958 --> 01:26:34,875
Somebody...save uncle.

1473
01:26:35,375 --> 01:26:38,041
Anybody...save him. - What happened?

1474
01:26:38,541 --> 01:26:39,916
Uncle..

1475
01:26:40,416 --> 01:26:42,000
Where are you going? - To save uncle.

1476
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:43,875
Or he'll bust his head. - So what?

1477
01:26:44,375 --> 01:26:45,958
That's the only way the doors will open. Upstairs, the ones below.

1478
01:26:46,458 --> 01:26:47,375
Then we can get out. - No, no.

1479
01:26:47,875 --> 01:26:48,583
I have to go. I want to save uncle.

1480
01:26:49,083 --> 01:26:50,750
You want to go? - Yes.

1481
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:54,750
Go!

1482
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,541
Don't let go.

1483
01:27:15,041 --> 01:27:16,750
Brother, hold on.

1484
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:20,750
I am coming...hold on.

1485
01:27:23,583 --> 01:27:24,083
Super Joe!

1486
01:27:24,583 --> 01:27:25,125
Super Joe!

1487
01:27:25,625 --> 01:27:27,375
Super Joe! - Super Joe!

1488
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:28,875
Super Joe!

1489
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:30,208
I am coming.

1490
01:27:30,708 --> 01:27:35,500
Let go, I have to save my brother.

1491
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,083
Super Joe! Super Joe!

1492
01:27:40,583 --> 01:27:44,833
What an honest kid. But he can't look after his suitcase.

1493
01:27:45,333 --> 01:27:48,833
You'll get us killed.

1494
01:27:52,916 --> 01:27:54,041
Get a blanket!

1495
01:27:54,541 --> 01:27:56,000
Super Joe! Super Joe!

1496
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:57,666
Super Joe! Super Joe!

1497
01:27:58,166 --> 01:27:59,583
Super Joe! Super Joe!

1498
01:28:00,083 --> 01:28:01,458
Super Joe! Super Joe!

1499
01:28:01,958 --> 01:28:02,958
Super Joe! Super Joe!

1500
01:28:03,458 --> 01:28:05,083
Hold it tight. Quickly.

1501
01:28:05,583 --> 01:28:07,250
This way... this way..

1502
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:11,708
Super Joe! Super Joe!

1503
01:28:12,208 --> 01:28:13,541
Super Joe! Super Joe!

1504
01:28:14,041 --> 01:28:15,375
Super Joe! Super Joe!

1505
01:28:15,875 --> 01:28:17,125
Super Joe!

1506
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:21,125
Careful..

1507
01:28:28,958 --> 01:28:30,333
Super Joe! Super Joe!

1508
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:32,041
Super Joe! Super Joe!

1509
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:34,375
Super Joe! Super Joe!

1510
01:28:34,875 --> 01:28:37,000
Look. Let's go.

1511
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:41,000
Super Joe!

1512
01:28:45,583 --> 01:28:49,083
Very good!

1513
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,958
You saved this old man today.

1514
01:28:55,458 --> 01:28:57,416
Even my own son..

1515
01:28:57,916 --> 01:29:01,416
..wouldn't have done what you did.

1516
01:29:08,416 --> 01:29:13,166
Gollu...I saved father.

1517
01:29:13,666 --> 01:29:20,291
That...burden inside me is gone.

1518
01:29:20,791 --> 01:29:22,750
I will tell mom...

1519
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:28,083
...that I saved father.

1520
01:29:28,583 --> 01:29:32,083
Come on.

1521
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,208
Aunty, buy green and red.

1522
01:29:46,708 --> 01:29:48,125
You know, whenever I went out..

1523
01:29:48,625 --> 01:29:50,041
..wearing a red shirt and green pant, my mother would..

1524
01:29:50,541 --> 01:29:52,166
..put a black spot on me here, to ward off the evil eye.

1525
01:29:52,666 --> 01:29:53,791
She would've done that..

1526
01:29:54,291 --> 01:29:55,500
..even if you paraded nude.

1527
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,125
How are you, Baldev? - Hello. Hello.

1528
01:29:58,625 --> 01:29:59,250
Hello.

1529
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:02,500
She's a mother after all. She likes everything.

1530
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:03,458
Baldev. - Yes.

1531
01:30:03,958 --> 01:30:04,791
Give me a can of red paint. - Yes.

1532
01:30:05,291 --> 01:30:05,958
A can of red paint. - Aunty.

1533
01:30:06,458 --> 01:30:07,833
Blue looks really good with red. Buy that too.

1534
01:30:08,333 --> 01:30:09,500
Red-blue...it'll look nice. - Yes.

1535
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,833
Give me a can of blue too. - Purple.

1536
01:30:12,333 --> 01:30:13,458
Purple?

1537
01:30:13,958 --> 01:30:15,541
Use purple with red.

1538
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:17,041
They blend really well.

1539
01:30:17,541 --> 01:30:19,708
Did eat lot of eggplants while growing up?

1540
01:30:20,208 --> 01:30:21,125
Let it be, son.

1541
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:23,083
What do you know about colors?

1542
01:30:23,583 --> 01:30:25,708
You never let any color in your life.

1543
01:30:26,208 --> 01:30:27,791
Purple...

1544
01:30:28,291 --> 01:30:29,083
How much?

1545
01:30:29,583 --> 01:30:30,583
Let go! Let go!

1546
01:30:31,083 --> 01:30:31,916
I'll show her. - What's wrong with him?

1547
01:30:32,416 --> 01:30:35,083
I'll tell her about colors. - Let him go. Let him go. Let him go.

1548
01:30:35,583 --> 01:30:35,875
What's wrong?

1549
01:30:36,375 --> 01:30:38,000
Look. Look. - What?

1550
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:39,333
I won this prize at the..

1551
01:30:39,833 --> 01:30:42,000
..All India Hussain Fine Arts Competition.

1552
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:43,458
For painting.

1553
01:30:43,958 --> 01:30:47,083
The best and emerging painter in India.

1554
01:30:47,583 --> 01:30:49,666
My life was filled with color.

1555
01:30:50,166 --> 01:30:56,333
But you don't know how those colors faded away.

1556
01:30:56,833 --> 01:30:58,458
Give me purple..

1557
01:30:58,958 --> 01:31:01,083
Brother.. - Give me purple...it'll look nice.

1558
01:31:01,583 --> 01:31:01,708
Yes, madam.

1559
01:31:02,208 --> 01:31:03,666
..Super Joe competition for Kids.

1560
01:31:04,166 --> 01:31:05,833
Children and parents are requested..

1561
01:31:06,333 --> 01:31:08,791
..to gather in the lobby at exactly 7 o'clock!

1562
01:31:09,291 --> 01:31:13,083
What have you done? You spilled all the water.

1563
01:31:13,583 --> 01:31:14,916
Sorry, give that to me. - What are you doing?

1564
01:31:15,416 --> 01:31:16,666
I'll clean it. - Please..

1565
01:31:17,166 --> 01:31:19,375
I'll clean it in a jiffy.

1566
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:21,458
Sir, what are you doing? - Gollu.

1567
01:31:21,958 --> 01:31:22,541
Are you crazy?

1568
01:31:23,041 --> 01:31:25,208
We should get out now, and you're mopping the place.

1569
01:31:25,708 --> 01:31:27,333
Sir.. - You go, brother, I can't come.

1570
01:31:27,833 --> 01:31:28,916
What? - Sir.. - Gollu, stop.

1571
01:31:29,416 --> 01:31:30,083
Stop. Stop.

1572
01:31:30,583 --> 01:31:31,708
Stop. Stop.

1573
01:31:32,208 --> 01:31:32,666
Let go.

1574
01:31:33,166 --> 01:31:34,958
We had a decision, I won't let you stay here.

1575
01:31:35,458 --> 01:31:36,916
I can't come, brother.

1576
01:31:37,416 --> 01:31:38,833
Pari madam as well as many other people are here.

1577
01:31:39,333 --> 01:31:40,583
I will look for it until the last second.

1578
01:31:41,083 --> 01:31:41,958
Madam, forgive me.

1579
01:31:42,458 --> 01:31:46,208
Only if I let you.

1580
01:31:46,708 --> 01:31:47,208
Gollu. - No.

1581
01:31:47,708 --> 01:31:48,875
Gollu. - No. - Listen to me.

1582
01:31:49,375 --> 01:31:51,041
Let's go. - No. no. I don't want to go.

1583
01:31:51,541 --> 01:31:53,500
Do what you want.

1584
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:54,791
Gollu!

1585
01:31:55,291 --> 01:31:55,708
Brother..

1586
01:31:56,208 --> 01:31:59,541
Gollu! Gollu!

1587
01:32:00,041 --> 01:32:03,541
Gollu!

1588
01:32:12,791 --> 01:32:14,583
Brother.. - Yes.

1589
01:32:15,083 --> 01:32:17,416
Everything is so beautiful.

1590
01:32:17,916 --> 01:32:19,791
Are we in heaven?

1591
01:32:20,291 --> 01:32:26,041
And heaven's got such beautiful...hawks?

1592
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:28,833
And why does it stink so much?

1593
01:32:29,333 --> 01:32:32,833
I guess humans have made this place filthy too.

1594
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:41,916
Brother...we're alive.

1595
01:32:42,416 --> 01:32:47,000
We're safe, Gollu. We're safe. - Yes.

1596
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:49,333
6:45...!

1597
01:32:49,833 --> 01:32:53,333
I guess even God wanted us to get out.

1598
01:33:29,083 --> 01:33:32,041
Gollu, there's a problem.

1599
01:33:32,541 --> 01:33:35,750
Something's flashing before my eyes.

1600
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:37,708
Flashing...

1601
01:33:38,208 --> 01:33:39,666
I can see all the people in the mall.

1602
01:33:40,166 --> 01:33:44,708
Pari madam...Puri...Jignesh.

1603
01:33:45,208 --> 01:33:46,541
Father...

1604
01:33:47,041 --> 01:33:49,958
We saved father with such difficulty.

1605
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:51,833
Will we lose him again? - See..

1606
01:33:52,333 --> 01:33:54,375
We made so many friends in one day.

1607
01:33:54,875 --> 01:33:55,166
If we stay here for a day..

1608
01:33:55,666 --> 01:33:58,666
..someone will give us a shop here.

1609
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:02,666
And we were leaving them?

1610
01:34:13,625 --> 01:34:16,333
Snake! Snake!

1611
01:34:16,833 --> 01:34:20,333
God's calling us back!

1612
01:34:24,375 --> 01:34:28,166
Come on.

1613
01:34:28,666 --> 01:34:32,166
How do the soldiers do this?

1614
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:38,958
Gustad!

1615
01:34:39,458 --> 01:34:42,041
Hey...why are you two coming up?

1616
01:34:42,541 --> 01:34:44,041
Go back. - Gustad.

1617
01:34:44,541 --> 01:34:45,416
We don't want to blowup these people..

1618
01:34:45,916 --> 01:34:46,666
..with your bomb. - Bomb?

1619
01:34:47,166 --> 01:34:47,291
Bomb?

1620
01:34:47,791 --> 01:34:49,791
God will protect our mom.

1621
01:34:50,291 --> 01:34:51,208
What are they saying about a bomb?

1622
01:34:51,708 --> 01:34:53,083
Nothing.. - Why are they calling you Gustad?

1623
01:34:53,583 --> 01:34:55,125
Sister-in-law, your husband..

1624
01:34:55,625 --> 01:34:59,208
..is wanted terrorist Gustad. - He gave us a bomb.

1625
01:34:59,708 --> 01:35:00,500
But we won't do it. - No.

1626
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:01,916
Sister-in-law, the bomb's inside.

1627
01:35:02,416 --> 01:35:07,333
It's inside. - No.. Saira.

1628
01:35:07,833 --> 01:35:09,375
Saira. Saira.

1629
01:35:09,875 --> 01:35:11,125
They're just blabbering.

1630
01:35:11,625 --> 01:35:14,416
Listen to me. - Don't touch me.

1631
01:35:14,916 --> 01:35:16,375
You are Gustad, not my Abdul.

1632
01:35:16,875 --> 01:35:17,541
You're a terrorist.

1633
01:35:18,041 --> 01:35:20,000
Don't talk nonsense. - You're the one talking nonsense.

1634
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:21,333
Don't let Muskan..

1635
01:35:21,833 --> 01:35:23,458
Muskan! Muskan! - Muskan.

1636
01:35:23,958 --> 01:35:25,333
Muskan! - Muskan.

1637
01:35:25,833 --> 01:35:27,958
Muskan!

1638
01:35:28,458 --> 01:35:31,958
Gollu, suitcase.

1639
01:35:41,375 --> 01:35:44,875
Super Joe, my father's evil.

1640
01:35:50,666 --> 01:35:52,083
Sit. Sit.. - I don't want it.

1641
01:35:52,583 --> 01:35:54,500
Eat some more. - Aunt, I can't eat anymore.

1642
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,208
That's exactly why you're so weak.

1643
01:35:56,708 --> 01:35:59,791
Even a short breeze of air can blow you away.

1644
01:36:00,291 --> 01:36:02,000
Eat quietly. - I don't want to.

1645
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:04,083
Eat it or I will slap you.

1646
01:36:04,583 --> 01:36:05,583
Finish it.

1647
01:36:06,083 --> 01:36:07,291
Finish it!

1648
01:36:07,791 --> 01:36:10,416
Hey...what are you staring at?

1649
01:36:10,916 --> 01:36:12,333
Want some sweetmeat? - Yes.

1650
01:36:12,833 --> 01:36:13,666
Then say it.

1651
01:36:14,166 --> 01:36:14,958
Yes, aunty.

1652
01:36:15,458 --> 01:36:17,708
Mr. Leader here won't eat anything. I guess he's too angry.

1653
01:36:18,208 --> 01:36:21,708
I'll get some sweetmeat for all of you.

1654
01:36:24,583 --> 01:36:25,666
What's wrong with you two?

1655
01:36:26,166 --> 01:36:27,916
Stop it.

1656
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:31,875
I am missing my mother.

1657
01:36:32,375 --> 01:36:33,666
She...

1658
01:36:34,166 --> 01:36:37,958
She would scold me too... and feed me.

1659
01:36:38,458 --> 01:36:41,958
Brother Sarfaraz, I wonder why Gustad..

1660
01:36:54,875 --> 01:36:58,375
Silky baby, the suitcase will be found.

1661
01:37:20,833 --> 01:37:24,666
"The thief stole the suitcase."

1662
01:37:25,166 --> 01:37:28,708
"The key isn't inside... there's nothing inside."

1663
01:37:29,208 --> 01:37:32,708
"He thinks he's smart... but he's been fooled."

1664
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:04,625
Come here.

1665
01:38:05,125 --> 01:38:07,458
If anything happens to my wife and kid..

1666
01:38:07,958 --> 01:38:08,625
..I won't spare you two.

1667
01:38:09,125 --> 01:38:10,458
How strange...

1668
01:38:10,958 --> 01:38:11,458
You're terrified because..

1669
01:38:11,958 --> 01:38:13,791
..your wife and kid are in danger now.

1670
01:38:14,291 --> 01:38:15,958
And the rest look like scapegoats.

1671
01:38:16,458 --> 01:38:17,833
Worth 10,000 each!

1672
01:38:18,333 --> 01:38:20,250
I am tired doing the same story all the time. - Me too.

1673
01:38:20,750 --> 01:38:21,625
Sanjay, how long are we going to..

1674
01:38:22,125 --> 01:38:24,541
..do stories on Valentine's Day?

1675
01:38:25,041 --> 01:38:27,916
I wish we get some good news.

1676
01:38:28,416 --> 01:38:29,208
This is all so boring.

1677
01:38:29,708 --> 01:38:33,208
Well.. - Do you want the biggest story of your life?

1678
01:38:38,041 --> 01:38:40,250
Son...how about some sweetmeat?

1679
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:42,916
Don't laugh, get to work.

1680
01:38:43,416 --> 01:38:44,000
Shameless.. - Yes, brother..

1681
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:46,166
I've made arrangements for the boys.

1682
01:38:46,666 --> 01:38:48,541
Kill the old lady.

1683
01:38:49,041 --> 01:38:50,833
Here, it's cold.

1684
01:38:51,333 --> 01:38:52,708
Hey leader, join us.

1685
01:38:53,208 --> 01:38:55,958
Drink some tea.

1686
01:38:56,458 --> 01:38:59,125
Didn't you hear what I said? - Do you want to drink all of it alone?

1687
01:38:59,625 --> 01:39:03,125
Sarfaraz. - No, brother. No more.

1688
01:39:07,916 --> 01:39:10,791
Aunty, I always wanted to be a mechanic.

1689
01:39:11,291 --> 01:39:12,791
That's not a big thing..

1690
01:39:13,291 --> 01:39:15,541
You can always work at Pappu's..

1691
01:39:16,041 --> 01:39:17,958
What's wrong with him?

1692
01:39:18,458 --> 01:39:20,500
Hey... calm down.

1693
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,375
What's wrong, son? What happened?

1694
01:39:23,875 --> 01:39:25,333
What did I say?

1695
01:39:25,833 --> 01:39:28,583
Forgive me. - Forgive me.

1696
01:39:29,083 --> 01:39:30,916
Fine...I forgive you.

1697
01:39:31,416 --> 01:39:36,416
Calm down now.

1698
01:39:36,916 --> 01:39:39,625
What's wrong? Can't I cry?

1699
01:39:40,125 --> 01:39:43,583
Brother.. - Brother!

1700
01:39:44,083 --> 01:39:46,458
What are you doing here? Come on!

1701
01:39:46,958 --> 01:39:47,750
Brother.

1702
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:49,833
Brother.

1703
01:39:50,333 --> 01:39:52,166
On one side we've the wonderful ambiance of Valentine's Day..

1704
01:39:52,666 --> 01:39:53,750
..and on the other, is this MMS that I received..

1705
01:39:54,250 --> 01:39:54,875
..from an unknown number.

1706
01:39:55,375 --> 01:39:58,750
This MMS has exposed the true face of terror.

1707
01:39:59,250 --> 01:40:00,708
Wanted terrorist Gustad Khan.

1708
01:40:01,208 --> 01:40:03,500
Is this what Gustad Khan really looks like? Yes!

1709
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
A call from the same number..

1710
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:08,625
..has revealed some facts, which proves..

1711
01:40:09,125 --> 01:40:10,250
..this is Gustad Khan.

1712
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:12,291
With cameraman Sanjay Mishra, this is Ayesha Seth.

1713
01:40:12,791 --> 01:40:14,250
FNN News, New Delhi!

1714
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:19,833
Backup at the Pacific Mall immediately

1715
01:40:20,333 --> 01:40:21,583
Hey..

1716
01:40:22,083 --> 01:40:22,958
Stop. - Mister..

1717
01:40:23,458 --> 01:40:24,291
Stop. Stop! - Mister..

1718
01:40:24,791 --> 01:40:27,041
What mister? - He's elder to me.

1719
01:40:27,541 --> 01:40:28,958
"Catch the thief by the toe.."

1720
01:40:29,458 --> 01:40:29,958
Brother..

1721
01:40:30,458 --> 01:40:31,916
That's the same terrorist I saw on TV.

1722
01:40:32,416 --> 01:40:34,625
You always said I should respect elders.

1723
01:40:35,125 --> 01:40:35,875
Stop.

1724
01:40:36,375 --> 01:40:39,875
Pari madam.. - Shut up!

1725
01:40:42,250 --> 01:40:45,750
Brother, don't look.

1726
01:40:48,708 --> 01:40:51,083
Let's go.

1727
01:40:51,583 --> 01:40:53,166
This way. Come on.

1728
01:40:53,666 --> 01:40:54,458
Let's go.

1729
01:40:54,958 --> 01:40:56,250
Look there.

1730
01:40:56,750 --> 01:40:59,791
Let's go take a look.

1731
01:41:00,291 --> 01:41:03,791
Mansi...that's brother.

1732
01:41:07,833 --> 01:41:09,166
Wait.

1733
01:41:09,666 --> 01:41:11,791
Puri sir, the boys are still here.

1734
01:41:12,291 --> 01:41:14,083
Close down all shops.

1735
01:41:14,583 --> 01:41:16,500
They won't have a place to hide.

1736
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,750
Understand?

1737
01:41:19,250 --> 01:41:20,541
Sunil, come with me. - Yes, sir.

1738
01:41:21,041 --> 01:41:22,291
And you stand guard at the back door. - Yes, sir.

1739
01:41:22,791 --> 01:41:24,541
And look, don't let anyone out. - Yes, sir.

1740
01:41:25,041 --> 01:41:27,083
Go.

1741
01:41:27,583 --> 01:41:28,500
Come on. Get inside.

1742
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,375
Try to understand, we are not terrorists?

1743
01:41:31,875 --> 01:41:32,625
Shut up.

1744
01:41:33,125 --> 01:41:35,625
Another word... and I'll shoot you.

1745
01:41:36,125 --> 01:41:39,708
Gollu, you explain her. - He'll explain me?

1746
01:41:40,208 --> 01:41:44,250
Gollu...aka Gustad Khan!

1747
01:41:44,750 --> 01:41:47,833
Rascals...you made me run around a lot.

1748
01:41:48,333 --> 01:41:50,083
I feel so stupid running around.

1749
01:41:50,583 --> 01:41:52,708
I had a police job, but now I'm a manager.

1750
01:41:53,208 --> 01:41:55,875
Madam.. - Quiet!

1751
01:41:56,375 --> 01:41:59,250
The government will reward me 4 million for your arrest.

1752
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:00,708
How much?

1753
01:42:01,208 --> 01:42:03,000
How much? - 4 million.

1754
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:04,625
And it won't make a difference even if you're dead.

1755
01:42:05,125 --> 01:42:06,291
I'll still get the same amount.

1756
01:42:06,791 --> 01:42:07,375
Come on.

1757
01:42:07,875 --> 01:42:08,833
Come on.

1758
01:42:09,333 --> 01:42:11,625
Stand here. Come on.

1759
01:42:12,125 --> 01:42:14,833
If you move, I'll pull the trigger.

1760
01:42:15,333 --> 01:42:18,833
Understand. Don't move.

1761
01:43:10,125 --> 01:43:10,958
Come on. Come on.

1762
01:43:11,458 --> 01:43:12,958
Come on.

1763
01:43:13,458 --> 01:43:14,625
There he is. What are you doing?

1764
01:43:15,125 --> 01:43:16,083
Go after him.

1765
01:43:16,583 --> 01:43:19,166
What are you doing? - Use your mind.

1766
01:43:19,666 --> 01:43:20,916
That's the same suitcase we've to find.

1767
01:43:21,416 --> 01:43:23,083
Why are you running after me? Run after him.

1768
01:43:23,583 --> 01:43:25,416
You fool...run!

1769
01:43:25,916 --> 01:43:29,416
Come on, brother. - This will work.

1770
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:36,083
It's open.

1771
01:43:36,583 --> 01:43:38,416
I can see light, but why is the wall still closed?

1772
01:43:38,916 --> 01:43:45,583
Light and...smoke? God!

1773
01:43:46,083 --> 01:43:49,583
Brother..

1774
01:43:57,416 --> 01:44:01,541
Brother, we knew you couldn't be terrorists.

1775
01:44:02,041 --> 01:44:02,708
Get out, come on.

1776
01:44:03,208 --> 01:44:04,708
You two run away. - No, father.

1777
01:44:05,208 --> 01:44:06,625
We have to diffuse the bomb.

1778
01:44:07,125 --> 01:44:08,708
Otherwise many innocent people will die.

1779
01:44:09,208 --> 01:44:11,041
Come on.

1780
01:44:11,541 --> 01:44:15,041
Bomb?

1781
01:44:33,583 --> 01:44:34,875
Stay back!

1782
01:44:35,375 --> 01:44:39,000
Return the suitcase.

1783
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:40,041
Bomb!

1784
01:44:40,541 --> 01:44:42,333
What a strange gait, boy.

1785
01:44:42,833 --> 01:44:45,750
Silky baby... he was calling you a bomb.

1786
01:44:46,250 --> 01:44:47,125
Leave that.

1787
01:44:47,625 --> 01:44:49,250
What are you doing? - Let it go.

1788
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:51,000
Let it go.

1789
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:55,000
That's mine.

1790
01:45:02,666 --> 01:45:05,125
Bomb!

1791
01:45:05,625 --> 01:45:06,500
Bomb!

1792
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,333
Bomb!

1793
01:45:09,833 --> 01:45:13,333
That's a bomb! Run!

1794
01:45:20,208 --> 01:45:24,041
Move back!

1795
01:45:24,541 --> 01:45:26,583
Move back!

1796
01:45:27,083 --> 01:45:30,791
Get out of here. What are you all doing?

1797
01:45:31,291 --> 01:45:34,791
Move back! Move back!

1798
01:45:42,916 --> 01:45:44,041
Run. - Bomb!

1799
01:45:44,541 --> 01:45:47,208
We will all die. Run!

1800
01:45:47,708 --> 01:45:51,208
Move back! Run!

1801
01:45:56,416 --> 01:45:58,750
Move!

1802
01:45:59,250 --> 01:46:02,750
Brother...

1803
01:46:09,708 --> 01:46:10,791
Why are you lying down?

1804
01:46:11,291 --> 01:46:12,541
Aunty! Aunty!

1805
01:46:13,041 --> 01:46:14,666
Did you turn that off? - I can't.

1806
01:46:15,166 --> 01:46:17,000
I don't remember the number.

1807
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:18,791
You don't remember the code? - No.

1808
01:46:19,291 --> 01:46:20,041
Don't you remember the code?

1809
01:46:20,541 --> 01:46:23,333
How can you forget the code?

1810
01:46:23,833 --> 01:46:26,458
I asked you to forget it, how can I remember?

1811
01:46:26,958 --> 01:46:27,208
What?

1812
01:46:27,708 --> 01:46:29,000
We have less than a minute before it explodes.

1813
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:31,250
What's the number? - Calm down, madam.

1814
01:46:31,750 --> 01:46:36,958
Don't you remember anything? - No. Not at all.

1815
01:46:37,458 --> 01:46:40,958
Super Joe!

1816
01:46:42,666 --> 01:46:45,375
Muskan.. - Super Joe, throw water on it.

1817
01:46:45,875 --> 01:46:49,375
Super Joe, throw water on it.

1818
01:46:49,875 --> 01:46:51,833
Super Joe. - No. No.

1819
01:46:52,333 --> 01:46:57,583
Super Joe. Super Joe. Super Joe.

1820
01:46:58,083 --> 01:46:59,666
That's how it happens in my videogame as well.

1821
01:47:00,166 --> 01:47:03,666
The bomb will explode. Run!

1822
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:12,583
"We've different languages."

1823
01:47:13,083 --> 01:47:15,375
"There's hope and disappointment."

1824
01:47:15,875 --> 01:47:17,500
"There's this and there's that."

1825
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,708
"But this is my country."

1826
01:47:20,208 --> 01:47:24,708
"We're all people of this country, we've one God."

1827
01:47:25,208 --> 01:47:27,000
"It's yours as well as mine."

1828
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:28,625
"This is my country."

1829
01:47:29,125 --> 01:47:30,958
Fear, Sarfaraz. Fear.

1830
01:47:31,458 --> 01:47:34,875
Fear gives rise to terror amongst the people. And it's diminishing.

1831
01:47:35,375 --> 01:47:36,250
Brother..

1832
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:40,250
Call the bomb squad.

1833
01:47:47,041 --> 01:47:50,541
Muskan.

1834
01:48:00,250 --> 01:48:03,208
Gustad...what's the number? - You fools...it's 555.

1835
01:48:03,708 --> 01:48:04,875
555!

1836
01:48:05,375 --> 01:48:08,875
Gustad?

1837
01:48:14,541 --> 01:48:18,041
Press the button!

1838
01:48:38,875 --> 01:48:42,375
Brother...

1839
01:49:25,291 --> 01:49:28,583
Muskan, are you okay?

1840
01:49:29,083 --> 01:49:29,791
Saira..

1841
01:49:30,291 --> 01:49:33,791
My own village boy turned out to be the real hero.

1842
01:49:52,416 --> 01:49:55,333
We were asked to share our experience with you.

1843
01:49:55,833 --> 01:49:56,916
So we stayed awake all night..

1844
01:49:57,416 --> 01:50:00,916
..and built a similar bomb for all of you.

1845
01:50:06,083 --> 01:50:07,083
See...

1846
01:50:07,583 --> 01:50:10,833
You can activate this bomb by pressing three buttons.

1847
01:50:11,333 --> 01:50:12,875
1...2...3..

1848
01:50:13,375 --> 01:50:16,500
It's activated. It's switched on.

1849
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,833
Now this bomb can blow you all up.

1850
01:50:20,333 --> 01:50:22,125
Yes. So don't fool around with it.

1851
01:50:22,625 --> 01:50:26,125
That's all we wanted to say. Brother, now turn it off.

1852
01:50:26,625 --> 01:50:28,333
"Gollu...Pappu.."

1853
01:50:28,833 --> 01:50:29,833
Off? - Yes.

1854
01:50:30,333 --> 01:50:32,250
But...what was the code?

1855
01:50:32,750 --> 01:50:36,875
"Gollu...Pappu.."

1856
01:50:37,375 --> 01:50:38,750
Brother... - Code.

1857
01:50:39,250 --> 01:50:42,125
Gollu...

1858
01:50:42,625 --> 01:50:45,500
Pappu? - Bomb!

1859
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:46,833
Run!

1860
01:50:47,333 --> 01:50:50,833
"Gollu...Pappu.."

1861
01:50:51,333 --> 01:50:54,833
"Gollu...Pappu.."

1862
01:50:55,333 --> 01:50:58,833
"Gollu...Pappu.."

1863
01:51:07,375 --> 01:51:11,166
"Gollu...Pappu.."

1864
01:51:11,666 --> 01:51:13,458
"Gollu...Pappu.."

1865
01:51:13,958 --> 01:51:15,500
"Gollu-Pappu in the house."

1866
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,583
"Let me...let me make 'em bounce."

1867
01:51:18,083 --> 01:51:19,583
"Let me...let me take 'em out."

1868
01:51:20,083 --> 01:51:21,666
"Let me show 'em what I am about."

1869
01:51:22,166 --> 01:51:23,666
"Gollu-Pappu in the house."

1870
01:51:24,166 --> 01:51:25,791
"Let me...let me make 'em bounce."

1871
01:51:26,291 --> 01:51:27,791
"Let me...let me take 'em out."

1872
01:51:28,291 --> 01:51:31,500
"Let me show 'em what I am about."

1873
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,500
"They're carefree good for nothing guys."

1874
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,625
"They make possible...impossible."

1875
01:51:40,125 --> 01:51:43,500
"They're carefree good for nothing guys."

1876
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:47,750
"They make possible...impossible."

1877
01:51:48,250 --> 01:51:51,958
"They think they are smarty, but be advised."

1878
01:51:52,458 --> 01:51:56,208
"They are very overdramatic."

1879
01:51:56,708 --> 01:51:58,083
"Gollu...Pappu."

1880
01:51:58,583 --> 01:52:00,166
"How many times are you going to goof up?"

1881
01:52:00,666 --> 01:52:04,166
"What's wrong with you, don't try to be too smart."

1882
01:52:20,875 --> 01:52:22,250
"The world is a big place."

1883
01:52:22,750 --> 01:52:24,166
"You have no teacher of pupils."

1884
01:52:24,666 --> 01:52:26,416
"We play a high game."

1885
01:52:26,916 --> 01:52:28,416
"But Don't worry.."

1886
01:52:28,916 --> 01:52:30,750
"We're men of our free will."

1887
01:52:31,250 --> 01:52:32,291
"Every day is a battle."

1888
01:52:32,791 --> 01:52:34,291
"We're always up to mischief."

1889
01:52:34,791 --> 01:52:38,291
"But Don't worry.."

1890
01:52:54,166 --> 01:52:55,750
"Gollu-Pappu in the house."

1891
01:52:56,250 --> 01:52:57,750
"Let me...let me make 'em bounce."

1892
01:52:58,250 --> 01:52:59,666
"Let me...let me take 'em out."

1893
01:53:00,166 --> 01:53:01,750
"Let me show 'em what I am about."

1894
01:53:02,250 --> 01:53:03,791
"Go...bounce.."

1895
01:53:04,291 --> 01:53:05,791
"Go...bounce.."

1896
01:53:06,291 --> 01:53:08,125
"Go...bounce.."
