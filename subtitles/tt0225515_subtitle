1
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:51,968
Don't tease him.

2
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,546
Go, your mom is in
search of you.

3
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:09,925
Ranvir, call your father.
He will be at Vikram uncle's place.

4
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,456
Tell him that the
food is ready.

5
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,329
Listen, think nicely,
Mumbai is such a big city...

6
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:18,067
...and you'll be there
all alone.

7
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,766
My dreams are about
to get fulfilled...

8
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:23,575
...and you want me to
give it a second thought?

9
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:27,074
As Mumbai is a big city,
I am going there.

10
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,838
You are right, but...
- Look at Kartar...

11
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:34,444
he owns ten taxies
today in Mumbai.

12
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,880
Our Herpal owns a very
a big shop there.

13
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,552
Agarwal went there recently.

14
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:43,721
You're right.
I'm not arguing with you.

15
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,627
They are indeed lucky.

16
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,497
Luck with hard work
is also necessary.

17
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,895
You know that I am a
hard worker.

18
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:57,132
All my wishes will be
fulfilled in Mumbai.

19
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,243
May God always boost
your confidence.

20
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:07,652
I'll keep your land with
me as your property.

21
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,983
What's wrong, Kiran?

22
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,345
She is suffering from cancer.
- So what?

23
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,083
Can't you cure my
Kiran, as an efficient doctor?

24
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,358
What's the use of your
being a doctor then?

25
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,120
I'm ready to buy all the
medicines that you prescribe.

26
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,659
But my Kiran should get
well soon.

27
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:37,097
Ranvir, my son, I'm going out
for a few days.

28
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:42,333
Till I return, take
care of Rocky.

29
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:50,912
As your dad's busy, you
should take care of Rocky.

30
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:55,148
Love him a lot, don't
ever beat him.

31
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,523
He is your kid brother.

32
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,699
Okay, mom, I will keep
him happy.

33
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,671
Shall I sleep with you?

34
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:29,882
I can't sleep nicely at home.
Dad can't sing a lullaby.

35
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:36,354
Why don't you sing?
- I will sing for you.

36
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:12,487
Rajvir has done
wonders, man.

37
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,537
But I don't wish to add another
name with Kiran Intercontinental...

38
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:31,478
...because memories of my
mom are in this.

39
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,868
Will your work get over
by tomorrow?

40
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:49,596
Yes sir.

41
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,337
Why are you taking away this T. V?
- We are from Technotronics.

42
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,405
As this entire lot is defective,
we're taking it back.

43
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:03,776
But what about the new ones?
- They will be reaching soon.

44
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,262
Know that tomorrow is my
hotel inauguration...

45
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,526
...and you're taking back the
T. Vs at the last minute?

46
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,725
Don't you test them
before sending out?

47
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:26,138
What do you mean? We
haven't sent anyone.

48
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,105
What?

49
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:36,067
Entire staff is waiting for you.
When are you reaching the hotel?

50
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:41,202
Line up the security staff.
I am just coming.

51
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:54,985
Food should be more tasty
than its presentation. Isn't it?

52
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:59,157
It's very tasty. You've
magic in your hands.

53
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,198
Boss will be happy
to eat this food.

54
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,833
Just call me,
Miss Geeta Patel.

55
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:23,214
She liked it a lot. You please
taste and tell me, how is it.

56
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:27,020
I have put in all my efforts
and experience in this.

57
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,894
I told you that I have
no time.

58
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,864
I have called for all
the security staff, sir.

59
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,018
Know, what's happening here?

60
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:18,002
Is this the way
you all work?

61
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,737
I don't mind if you
insult me.

62
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,111
But if you insult my idli,
then I will quit this job.

63
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,242
Look, our boss is a very nice man.
- My foot! He has no time!

64
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,859
Listen, we'll offer your
idlis to all our guests.

65
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,799
No, I have decided to
leave this job.

66
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,105
Sir, I wish to say
something.

67
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,437
Before that, I wish to
say something.

68
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,808
That rangoli of yours
is indeed beautiful.

69
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,979
You are a good Chef
and also a good artist.

70
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:36,829
But who are you?

71
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:40,961
Didn't you recognise me?
I am your uncle?

72
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:50,971
I'm your distant relative.
In a way, I'm your uncle.

73
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:55,853
Give me a kiss...

74
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,350
That chain...
- Don't worry. I'll put that chain.

75
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:03,756
Lots of thefts take
place here.

76
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,721
Who is he?
- Your mom's distant relative.

77
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,761
That is why your dad has
a soft corner for him.

78
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,003
But you seem to have gone
senile even before me.

79
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:20,770
You'll be happy to know that
I'll be staying with you all.

80
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:32,218
If you ask me, where was
I before this, then...

81
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:37,786
Hey! You keep talking non-stop.
He's very tired.

82
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,257
Let him eat.

83
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:44,933
Is this any time to eat?
The sun hasn't set till now.

84
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:49,972
Here there's noise and
activity till 10 P.M.

85
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,469
As you're hungry, eat
something.

86
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:02,412
O.K. I'll go and sit
near brother-in-law.

87
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:08,117
How long will he be here?
- Till he empties the stocks.

88
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,236
Who is going to receive
the Mayor saab?

89
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,511
Mayor is coming here
by his own vehicle.

90
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,111
You just wait at the gate
to receive the guests.

91
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,674
But what happened to your
pampered Rajvir?

92
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:10,850
As his College reopens on Monday,
this will be his last weekend.

93
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:15,784
You've pampered him a lot. He won't
reach on time tomorrow. I bet.

94
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:17,645
The priest says, there is
still time for inauguration.

95
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:20,618
So, you'll have to wait
for some time.

96
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:26,486
Till then, I'll request my
dad to address you all.

97
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,116
I say, no priest has given
us any time.

98
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:53,850
My younger son, Rajvir
is late as usual...

99
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:58,688
...and my elder son Ranvir
as usual by telling lies...

100
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:02,498
...is trying to save him.

101
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:08,004
These kids forget that we
know all their moves.

102
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:12,708
They forget something...
I am their father!

103
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,703
Your uncle...

104
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,477
Come with me, I want
to talk to you.

105
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,445
What is it?

106
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,015
Dad has groomed us
both till today.

107
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:04,787
I wish that we reach
great heights in business.

108
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:09,421
We should have our
hotel in all the cities.

109
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,085
I can achieve this, provided
you are with me.

110
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:17,696
I am with you. We will have
our hotels built all over the world.

111
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,662
You think I'm drunk?

112
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:25,735
You don't reach here on time
and now you're talking high...

113
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:31,446
We'll show that no one can challenge
Kiran group of Hotels.

114
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,542
I'll start working with
you from tomorrow.

115
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:39,949
No... first you finish
your studies, then help me.

116
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:29,292
I'll pay for all their
drinks tonight.

117
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:27,784
She is my cousin.

118
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:32,888
Is it? But don't know
why all girls are your cousins.

119
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:37,666
I'll say that you better
stay away from her.

120
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,693
Am I close to her?

121
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,074
Any problem?
- Yes.

122
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,534
As usual.

123
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,875
He told you to stay away
from her.

124
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,410
He means it. Understand?

125
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:59,518
No. Did you understand?

126
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:50,230
Why were you all fighting
with that boy?

127
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:52,542
After all, he had not
harmed me, Nikhil.

128
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:56,407
Shalini, you are new
to this College.

129
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,407
It'll take some time for
you to grasp, things here.

130
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:02,550
It would be better if you
remain away from this boy.

131
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:18,066
If you need anything or if
someone rags you, then...

132
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,064
...just inform us.

133
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,467
O.K. See you then...

134
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,202
Hey! She's a real magic.

135
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:33,174
She is my cousin, afterall.

136
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,198
I like him.

137
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:57,099
But all speak ill of him here.
I think everyone is jealous.

138
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:00,135
To be handsome doesn't
mean that he's also decent.

139
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:02,412
He's exploiting all
with his looks.

140
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,549
He smiles and hooks girls
and ditches them too.

141
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,980
Spoilt brat of
a rich father!

142
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:16,751
His entire group is like that.
No one is interested in studies.

143
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:22,828
This is his life style...
- That's great, man!

144
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:26,633
Do you come to the College
to do all these things?

145
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:29,699
Where else can we freak out?

146
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:34,406
After College life, we'll
get married, have kids...

147
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:38,214
...we've to do all these
for the rest of our lives.

148
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:40,913
Why don't you understand?
He is a womaniser.

149
00:43:57,701 --> 00:44:00,761
Could you tell me who uttered
the word "love" first?

150
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:03,733
Adam and Eve did.
- Shut up.

151
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:07,177
Don't poke your nose
in between, you fool.

152
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,412
As if you've researched
a lot on love...

153
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:14,841
Tell her Shalini...
- Why disturb her? Carry on, Shalini.

154
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,794
What is your name?

155
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,231
Shalini, won't you tell
your name?

156
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:11,736
Your eyes are very pretty.

157
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:18,373
How about my eyes?

158
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:31,955
Stop repeating the same line.
Learn something new. Move.

159
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,365
The Principal!

160
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,101
I'll fix you in the race.

161
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,933
Congrats! You've won...

162
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:33,440
Were you doubtful about
my victory?

163
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,713
This is for you...

164
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:49,922
This looks like me!

165
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:54,754
That's you, Rajvir...
- That's nice.

166
00:48:58,368 --> 00:48:59,835
You draw very well.

167
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:05,065
And dance also nicely.

168
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:19,352
Tonight, we are going to
Cloud Nine, coming?

169
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:24,258
Of course, I will surely come.

170
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:59,586
You look very pretty.
What will you have?

171
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:08,095
What are you doing here?
- Forget it. Did you see Rajvir?

172
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:09,997
He must be somewhere around.

173
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:14,869
They've gone, as usual...

174
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:28,927
I can't tolerate violence.

175
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:34,196
I am scared to even hear
someone talking loudly.

176
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:38,135
I had come to the disco
for the first time.

177
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:44,011
My parents don't
like all these.

178
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,249
They're scared that I too
shouldn't follow...

179
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:49,313
...the wrong track like
my brother.

180
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:53,950
He married a foreigner,
and deserted us.

181
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:57,558
I too feel restless
in parties.

182
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:05,125
But today I wanted to come
here as you had invited me.

183
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:09,033
So, I took my cousin's
help and came here.

184
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:12,134
You mean, your parents
are not aware you sneaked?

185
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:15,804
Right. I jumped out of my window,
through a tree and came down.

186
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:29,922
I wanted to meet you.

187
00:55:30,593 --> 00:55:32,356
Your looks are deceptive.

188
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:41,793
Meaning?

189
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:55,745
It's time to go home now.

190
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:24,369
Tell us about the new girl.

191
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:37,222
She stopped the car...

192
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:39,684
We got down.

193
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:44,766
She removed her shoes...

194
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:48,963
then her jeans...

195
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:54,566
She raised her jeans...

196
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:58,171
and climbed up a tree...

197
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,316
She went into her room
through the window.

198
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:21,029
Then what happened?
- Then, I came here...

199
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:23,929
Hey! You're rendering
film dialogues...

200
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:27,274
What to do? The girl
is of that type.

201
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:08,984
Try talking to Ranvir...
- That would be great...

202
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:21,954
Rocky! You came here?
- I was brought here.

203
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:27,187
God bless you. I'm happy
to see you in this farm.

204
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:29,999
Are you harvesting the crops?
- Yes dad.

205
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:32,401
It rained a few days ago.
The crops were getting spoiled.

206
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:34,500
That's why I am harvesting
them soon.

207
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:37,372
I want to talk to you, son.

208
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:41,535
I got a letter from Vikram.

209
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:56,292
He's my good pal.

210
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:59,687
I want this friendship to get
transformed into relationship.

211
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:06,327
You don't have
a girlfriend, do you?

212
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:16,039
I hope you don't have
any objections, do you?

213
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:20,739
No, daddy. As you wish.

214
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:27,347
That is good my son, now
go and finish your work.

215
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:37,557
He'll never disobey us.

216
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:41,627
And here is one, who
never obeys me.

217
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:44,665
Now, how can I obey
whatever you say?

218
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:53,613
Have you agreed to marry?

219
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:07,860
Marrying a rural girl?

220
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:59,839
Let's see, who reaches
the tube-well first.

221
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:50,791
Rocky, do come and help
your brother at times.

222
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,764
You're always busy with
your own friends.

223
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:57,231
I don't want buttermilk...
- Will you have whisky then?

224
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:03,576
Now, I've to search a
beautiful girl for you.

225
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:06,607
Tomorrow I am going to Dhanova's
house for Ladies Sangeet.

226
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:09,351
I'll search for a
nice girl there.

227
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:11,447
Take me along with
you, tomorrow.

228
01:03:11,654 --> 01:03:15,920
What, me? I don't go
to such functions.

229
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:17,356
Ask him...

230
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:25,333
No one need go. I am
still going strong.

231
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:28,737
I'll go all alone.
I'll tell everyone there...

232
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:31,563
...that I've two healthy
grandsons...

233
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:34,006
...but both have no
time for me.

234
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,340
Damn your costly car...
it can't reach me there soon.

235
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:43,579
This is a car and not a plane.
And worse, look at the traffic.

236
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:18,981
We were all just waiting for you.
- My grandson got me delayed.

237
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:27,062
So, when should I
come to pick you up?

238
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:29,389
Come at four.
- O.K.

239
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:01,910
Will you have an ice-cream?

240
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:15,657
That's not the right way
to throw a ball.

241
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:17,391
Which is the right way?

242
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:09,571
I don't want.
- Why? You asked for one.

243
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:11,741
Yes. But I don't want it now.

244
01:09:15,017 --> 01:09:17,144
Is it necessary to teach
bowling to everyone?

245
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:24,024
I don't like that at all.
- Why? What's wrong in it?

246
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:43,103
Hey! What are you doing?
- Your shirt is soiled.

247
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:48,273
You look very nice in
this shirt.

248
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:53,019
If you're through with dry cleaning,
shall we play?

249
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:04,264
When did you come?

250
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:12,322
Thank God, I'm not
afflicted by this sickness...

251
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:14,001
...nor will I ever get it.

252
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:21,475
Listen...
- Don't touch me.

253
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:24,139
Perhaps I too
may catch your sickness.

254
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:38,119
Teasing me?

255
01:16:39,962 --> 01:16:43,796
Will you kill me?
- I can do anything in love.

256
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:45,934
If you're in love, you'll
do the same...

257
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:50,262
Now, understood, what love is?
- Yes.

258
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:58,538
But what'll happen
to that girl from Punjab?

259
01:16:59,581 --> 01:17:01,481
You've agreed to marry her.

260
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:09,049
Yes Rocky. What will I
tell dad now?

261
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:14,025
Afterall, I am there.
Don't worry.

262
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:35,739
What are you doing?

263
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:41,723
No, I'm not in love...

264
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:46,560
Now you're cornered!

265
01:17:49,531 --> 01:17:52,557
Who is that girl?
- I don't know.

266
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:56,334
What is her name?
- I don't know.

267
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:59,573
Where does she live?
- I don't know.

268
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:02,005
Then what do you know?
- I know.

269
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:08,375
I know this much that the girl
is beautiful and I like her.

270
01:18:28,937 --> 01:18:31,804
Were you also suffering
from the same sickness?

271
01:18:42,584 --> 01:18:44,745
I'm Biji speaking.

272
01:18:44,953 --> 01:18:48,787
Vir Singh's mother of
Kiran International.

273
01:18:54,096 --> 01:18:58,795
I saw your daughter
at Dhanova's function.

274
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:01,365
She's very beautiful girl.

275
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:08,808
I thought, why not I ask
her hand for my grandson?

276
01:19:10,712 --> 01:19:16,173
He also likes her a lot.
Why, what happened?

277
01:19:16,618 --> 01:19:20,816
I never imagined Shalini will get
a proposal from such a rich family.

278
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:25,923
Her name is as beautiful,
as her looks.

279
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:30,860
So, when can we come
to meet you all?

280
01:19:32,234 --> 01:19:34,099
Tomorrow is Saturday.
I've a half day.

281
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:36,562
Come the day after tomorrow,
as it's a holiday.

282
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:39,200
No, we will come tomorrow
itself.

283
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:46,271
We don't want anyone else
to flick your girl before us.

284
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:50,846
It means, if this proposal
clicks, Shalini will go away?

285
01:19:51,153 --> 01:19:55,954
Then, will you keep entertaining
a young daughter here, forever?

286
01:19:57,259 --> 01:19:59,022
She is a kid now.

287
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:06,334
We are not the only parents
who have a young daughter.

288
01:20:07,269 --> 01:20:08,930
This had to happen one day.

289
01:20:10,672 --> 01:20:13,004
I pray that this clicks.

290
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:17,575
It'll click as our Shalini
is a lovely child.

291
01:20:17,779 --> 01:20:20,213
Shalini should also
like that boy.

292
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:25,881
Come on, let's talk to her.

293
01:20:27,055 --> 01:20:30,320
Now, she'll be sleeping.
- Let us wake her up, then.

294
01:26:10,231 --> 01:26:11,562
Where are you taking me?

295
01:26:19,641 --> 01:26:24,601
Today, I am very happy.
- It's evident. But why?

296
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:26,536
Yes, I love you.

297
01:26:40,828 --> 01:26:44,195
Not only your eyes,
you also look beautiful

298
01:26:57,545 --> 01:26:58,512
We've reached the shore.

299
01:27:07,689 --> 01:27:10,954
Come on, let's go to the other party.
- No, no, I must go home now.

300
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:16,023
Now, you've come out of your house.
Doesn't matter if you go back late.

301
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:17,256
Your parents will be
sleeping afterall.

302
01:27:18,633 --> 01:27:21,898
Yes, even then, not
today Rajvir.

303
01:27:22,937 --> 01:27:26,395
Next time, I will be with
you as long as you want.

304
01:27:28,943 --> 01:27:29,967
I'll drop you home.

305
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:42,055
Why are you laughing?

306
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:45,286
Can't help it. You've made
a monkey out of me.

307
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:56,565
Who are you?

308
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:03,700
What are you doing
there? Come inside...

309
01:28:10,051 --> 01:28:14,511
Where had you been?
- I had gone to dance...

310
01:28:14,756 --> 01:28:18,954
Who knows if you went to
dance or for something else?

311
01:28:19,994 --> 01:28:22,326
Do you smoke?
- No, mummy.

312
01:28:22,497 --> 01:28:24,226
Do you booze?
- No.

313
01:28:24,365 --> 01:28:27,801
Drugs?
- No.

314
01:28:44,218 --> 01:28:46,982
Why don't you make
mom understand, dad?

315
01:28:47,955 --> 01:28:49,980
What's there to make
her understand?

316
01:28:50,291 --> 01:28:55,251
We were so proud of you.

317
01:28:56,731 --> 01:28:59,495
Now you've put us
to shame

318
01:29:00,301 --> 01:29:05,261
We were so happy and came here
to talk about your marriage?

319
01:29:05,473 --> 01:29:08,271
No... not wedding!

320
01:29:15,249 --> 01:29:18,275
Saying no after all
these things?

321
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:35,530
Don't cry, Rama.

322
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:47,912
I can't help it!

323
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:56,179
I beg of you, even if
you've a little love for us...

324
01:29:58,459 --> 01:30:02,418
...then don't let us down
before the boy, who's coming...

325
01:30:02,597 --> 01:30:03,894
...tomorrow to see you.

326
01:31:21,442 --> 01:31:22,636
I'm Shalini's dad.

327
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:34,982
Excuse me, our house
is slightly small.

328
01:31:35,122 --> 01:31:38,148
Forget it, you should
have a big heart.

329
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:47,997
Priya, see if Shalini is
ready or not.

330
01:31:48,135 --> 01:31:52,094
He is my son and Ranvir
is my grandson.

331
01:31:52,273 --> 01:31:55,936
And I am his grandson's
uncle...

332
01:31:57,545 --> 01:32:02,505
Here is my card. You'll get
durable baniyans from me alone.

333
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:06,882
If this proposal clicks,
then, I'll give you 20%% discount.

334
01:32:11,292 --> 01:32:15,126
What will you have?
Coffee, tea or cold drinks?

335
01:32:15,296 --> 01:32:18,823
We've come to take away
your daughter. Where's she?

336
01:32:32,747 --> 01:32:35,045
Is she a girl or a
full moon?

337
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:38,275
Sit near me, my dear.

338
01:32:52,099 --> 01:32:54,863
She is our only asset.

339
01:34:07,842 --> 01:34:10,504
Have tea atleast.
- O.K.

340
01:34:10,611 --> 01:34:11,441
Two tea please.

341
01:34:21,122 --> 01:34:23,022
You look beautiful
in this dress.

342
01:34:28,696 --> 01:34:30,664
You know, I didn't see you for
the first time in that function?

343
01:34:31,732 --> 01:34:35,828
I saw you at a signal.
I'll take you there sometime.

344
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:40,338
It was dusk and raining
slightly.

345
01:34:42,443 --> 01:34:47,403
Everything around was beautiful.
I kept staring at you.

346
01:34:48,716 --> 01:34:52,982
You were lost in the crowd...
And I was lost in you.

347
01:34:56,157 --> 01:34:59,126
I didn't know when the
traffic signal turned green.

348
01:34:59,894 --> 01:35:04,854
I passed by that way many
times with the intention that...

349
01:35:06,233 --> 01:35:07,860
...I could meet you again,
but it was in vain.

350
01:35:49,977 --> 01:35:52,775
You had called me up.
What is it?

351
01:35:53,347 --> 01:35:56,316
Nothing. I am sitting with
someone here.

352
01:35:57,451 --> 01:36:07,224
Sitting with your dream girl?
I am just coming there.

353
01:36:07,695 --> 01:36:10,425
No, no, I will talk to
you later.

354
01:36:10,898 --> 01:36:18,703
My younger brother.
Looks like I spoke a lot.

355
01:36:21,275 --> 01:36:26,235
Tell me, how did you find me,
when you saw me first?

356
01:36:29,517 --> 01:36:31,041
I can't marry you.

357
01:36:33,888 --> 01:36:35,480
What did you say?

358
01:36:37,024 --> 01:36:40,858
I love someone else and
wish to marry him.

359
01:36:49,336 --> 01:36:56,674
Look, don't mistake me.
You're a very nice man.

360
01:37:04,585 --> 01:37:09,545
I am helpless.
I am sorry...

361
01:37:21,969 --> 01:37:23,994
When you didn't want
to marry me...

362
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:25,502
...then why did you concede
to meet me?

363
01:37:25,906 --> 01:37:30,866
Due to my parents. They
forced me to meet you.

364
01:37:32,112 --> 01:37:36,071
I couldn't dare to say
no to them.

365
01:37:37,818 --> 01:37:42,778
The boy whom I love,
is not approved by...

366
01:37:42,923 --> 01:37:45,221
...my parents due to
misconception.

367
01:37:46,193 --> 01:37:49,788
As such he loves
me a lot.

368
01:37:56,770 --> 01:38:01,036
My parents will be hurt
by this decision of mine.

369
01:38:03,143 --> 01:38:08,103
But I can't help it.
Tell me what should I do?

370
01:38:10,017 --> 01:38:14,249
Marry the one whom
you love.

371
01:38:16,924 --> 01:38:17,618
Shall we?

372
01:38:33,173 --> 01:38:34,902
You forgot this.

373
01:38:38,245 --> 01:38:39,769
You shouldn't have
done that.

374
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:51,080
What happened?
Why did they leave so early?

375
01:38:51,191 --> 01:38:52,283
Did you?

376
01:38:53,994 --> 01:38:56,724
Yes, I told him everything.

377
01:38:58,465 --> 01:39:03,960
He too told me to marry
Rajvir, as I love him.

378
01:39:12,646 --> 01:39:15,547
You ignored such a nice
proposal due to Rajvir?

379
01:39:15,716 --> 01:39:17,308
Do you know him?
- Yes.

380
01:39:18,986 --> 01:39:21,454
Nikhil said, he is studying
in her College only.

381
01:39:21,522 --> 01:39:24,685
His hobby is booze,
girls and mischief.

382
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:26,555
She is his present
hobby these days.

383
01:39:28,529 --> 01:39:33,489
Believe me, dad.
He is not like that.

384
01:39:38,172 --> 01:39:41,903
I've resigned to one fact,
my child.

385
01:39:45,512 --> 01:39:48,345
You should give me
one more chance.

386
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:52,581
All that you say about
Rajvir is wrong.

387
01:39:53,387 --> 01:39:58,347
I alone know him fully.
He is very nice.

388
01:39:59,326 --> 01:40:00,918
He loves me a lot.

389
01:40:02,763 --> 01:40:04,663
He'll come once to
meet you.

390
01:40:22,049 --> 01:40:23,175
Then call him.

391
01:40:32,292 --> 01:40:34,123
I want to talk to you.
- Yes, tell me...

392
01:40:34,228 --> 01:40:35,627
Not here...
- What's wrong with this place?

393
01:40:41,935 --> 01:40:44,062
Not even here!
- What are you doing?

394
01:40:52,613 --> 01:40:56,413
That night after you went...
- I forgot, what happened?

395
01:40:56,583 --> 01:41:00,542
I tried a lot on your mobile.
I had left a message for you.

396
01:41:00,687 --> 01:41:03,212
Where were you?
- At the party. I was high.

397
01:41:04,525 --> 01:41:06,220
So I slept the the whole day.

398
01:41:06,827 --> 01:41:10,786
My parents wanted me to
marry that boy.

399
01:41:12,699 --> 01:41:15,224
They don't like my
freaking out of my house.

400
01:41:25,145 --> 01:41:27,739
Come and meet my
parents once.

401
01:41:28,549 --> 01:41:32,246
Unless our parents meet,
how can we marry?

402
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:42,191
Unless our parents meet,
how can we marry?

403
01:41:58,078 --> 01:41:59,272
Try to be serious.

404
01:42:11,191 --> 01:42:12,920
Do you love me?

405
01:42:21,335 --> 01:42:26,932
Why this whimsical mood today?
- Yes, or no?

406
01:42:34,114 --> 01:42:39,074
I like your company.

407
01:42:57,004 --> 01:43:01,964
It means that you
don't love me

408
01:43:52,125 --> 01:43:57,085
It means, what people
say about you is true.

409
01:43:58,432 --> 01:44:00,263
What do they say?

410
01:44:11,278 --> 01:44:12,905
What do I do with girls?

411
01:44:13,947 --> 01:44:18,907
What did I do with you? Have I ever
touched you against your wish?

412
01:44:45,846 --> 01:44:46,778
I'll never meet you again. Never.

413
01:44:46,847 --> 01:44:49,281
Hey, who are you to say that
you'll not meet me?

414
01:44:49,349 --> 01:44:52,580
I say, I'll never meet
you again.

415
01:45:01,428 --> 01:45:03,521
Such a nice boy will not
remain a bachelor for long.

416
01:45:04,865 --> 01:45:07,959
Whatever you both said
should be done soon.

417
01:45:09,002 --> 01:45:14,007
If Shalini wants, we will
meet that boy once.

418
01:45:14,007 --> 01:45:16,601
Else we seek the other proposal...
what is the name of that boy?

419
01:45:34,294 --> 01:45:35,761
He doesn't love me dad.

420
01:45:37,464 --> 01:45:39,762
He says that he was
never in love with me.

421
01:45:43,870 --> 01:45:49,934
He doesn't know, what love and
marriage is all about.

422
01:45:55,315 --> 01:46:00,275
And I loved such a man
like a fool.

423
01:46:08,061 --> 01:46:10,586
I wish to die, dad.

424
01:46:13,333 --> 01:46:17,531
What are you saying?
Don't talk like this.

425
01:46:17,704 --> 01:46:19,228
Never talk about death.

426
01:46:19,573 --> 01:46:23,100
I committed a mistake.
Please forgive me.

427
01:46:24,010 --> 01:46:28,970
Due to me, you had to
get insulted.

428
01:46:29,082 --> 01:46:30,549
I've broken your
faith in me.

429
01:46:30,917 --> 01:46:35,877
It is all due to that boy,
who never loved me.

430
01:46:38,859 --> 01:46:43,819
What's wrong?
All of us commit mistakes, don't we?

431
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:47,761
If one Rajvir is bad, that
doesn't mean, all boys are bad.

432
01:46:48,101 --> 01:46:53,061
I don't want to get
married at all.

433
01:46:54,474 --> 01:46:58,137
I just want to stay with you.

434
01:46:59,045 --> 01:47:04,050
Promise me that you'll
never separate me from you.

435
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:06,712
I don't wish to go
anywhere...

436
01:47:06,887 --> 01:47:10,653
Who is sending you away from here?
You'll stay with us only.

437
01:47:11,758 --> 01:47:13,658
We'll stay together.

438
01:47:15,495 --> 01:47:18,225
You'll take care of me, won't you?
- Yes dad...

439
01:53:30,069 --> 01:53:32,230
What's wrong, Rajvir?
- Nothing.

440
01:53:36,843 --> 01:53:40,802
Why, do you like this film?
- The film is nice.

441
01:53:40,947 --> 01:53:42,812
But you're not in a
mood these days.

442
01:53:42,882 --> 01:53:44,179
You're in love with Shalini.

443
01:53:49,856 --> 01:53:52,051
Everyone is saying this.
- Really?

444
01:54:03,903 --> 01:54:05,768
Do you all feel that
I'm in love with Shalini?

445
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:15,643
You all feel that
I love her?

446
01:54:17,817 --> 01:54:20,650
Yes. We feel that you're
in love with Shalini.

447
01:54:32,432 --> 01:54:34,457
I love Shalini!

448
01:55:15,375 --> 01:55:17,434
Is Shalini there?
- Who are you?

449
01:55:26,185 --> 01:55:28,710
So, you are Rajvir?
- Yes...

450
01:55:36,763 --> 01:55:37,957
Why have you come here?

451
01:55:38,698 --> 01:55:40,461
I want to talk to Shalini.

452
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:43,100
Talk to me!

453
01:55:43,903 --> 01:55:46,167
I want to talk to Shalini!

454
01:55:51,277 --> 01:55:56,237
Look, you've already broken
my daughter's heart once.

455
01:55:57,216 --> 01:56:00,549
With great difficulty, she
has got over it.

456
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:02,483
Do you want to make
her cry again?

457
01:56:04,090 --> 01:56:07,184
I don't know, what your
daughter has told you.

458
01:56:08,027 --> 01:56:11,758
If our moving together, roaming
together and our friendship

459
01:56:11,864 --> 01:56:14,628
is named as love...
ho wam I to be blamed?

460
01:56:17,937 --> 01:56:21,338
I've come here to tell her
that I don't love her...

461
01:56:21,441 --> 01:56:24,274
...in front of all my
friends, today.

462
01:56:32,018 --> 01:56:34,987
Shalini has realised that
you don't love her.

463
01:56:36,322 --> 01:56:39,587
Look, once you've made
her a laughing stock.

464
01:56:39,692 --> 01:56:43,287
I won't allow that
to happen again.

465
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:45,457
Go away quietly
from here.

466
01:56:45,631 --> 01:56:49,658
Unless I talk to Shalini,
I'll not budge from here.

467
01:56:49,969 --> 01:56:52,494
What do you think of
yourself?

468
01:56:53,473 --> 01:56:57,000
You've no manners to talk with
elders. Which family?

469
01:56:58,778 --> 01:57:01,941
Don't talk about my family.
Talk to me.

470
01:57:04,283 --> 01:57:06,046
What is your status?

471
01:57:06,219 --> 01:57:08,050
First, have a look
at your own family.

472
01:57:08,388 --> 01:57:11,687
Your daughter used to come
stealthily to meet me.

473
01:57:12,658 --> 01:57:15,752
Are you going or should
I call the Police?

474
01:57:15,862 --> 01:57:19,195
Call the Police. What
have I done?

475
01:57:21,300 --> 01:57:24,963
I just came to talk.
What have I done?

476
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:32,200
Talking about my family...
What is your status?

477
01:57:38,251 --> 01:57:41,152
I came to tell you that
I don't love Shalini...

478
01:57:52,465 --> 01:57:55,298
Now, have you realised
that I don't love her?

479
02:00:04,397 --> 02:00:05,489
This is Goldie speaking.

480
02:00:05,598 --> 02:00:07,998
Where is Rocky?
- He is busy fighting.

481
02:00:08,167 --> 02:00:09,998
With whom?

482
02:00:10,269 --> 02:00:15,002
Several boys have nabbed him.
- Where are you all now?

483
02:02:24,737 --> 02:02:25,863
He challenges me!

484
02:02:33,479 --> 02:02:38,439
Leave it... Come...
You can't even walk properly.

485
02:02:45,124 --> 02:02:49,720
Who were these boys?
Why don't you speak?

486
02:02:50,129 --> 02:02:50,959
They were from my College.

487
02:02:57,336 --> 02:02:59,167
Why are you so heavily
drunk today?

488
02:03:12,852 --> 02:03:13,910
Rocky is hurt.

489
02:03:19,592 --> 02:03:24,552
I've spoilt you by giving
you freedom.

490
02:03:29,935 --> 02:03:34,895
Had Goldie not phoned me up,
then what would've happened?

491
02:03:36,475 --> 02:03:38,773
Atleast think about us.

492
02:03:40,613 --> 02:03:42,137
We love you so much!

493
02:03:43,549 --> 02:03:45,642
Why don't you say something?

494
02:04:01,567 --> 02:04:05,162
Alas! What has happened?
- Nothing. Bring the first aid kit.

495
02:04:06,505 --> 02:04:08,302
What happened Rocky?
- Nothing dad, don't worry.

496
02:04:08,507 --> 02:04:12,170
I've phoned up doctor.
He'll be coming here soon.

497
02:04:12,511 --> 02:04:17,471
He has lost so much of blood.
Why aren't you talking Rocky?

498
02:04:25,257 --> 02:04:26,849
Were you involved
in a fight?

499
02:04:31,430 --> 02:04:32,055
Don't move.

500
02:04:35,534 --> 02:04:38,970
Keep quiet. We've no sympathy
towards you today.

501
02:04:39,038 --> 02:04:40,767
This boy will drain us
out of our lives.

502
02:05:05,998 --> 02:05:06,828
You've pampered him a lot.

503
02:05:21,814 --> 02:05:24,339
Am I a kid to abide by
whatever you say?

504
02:05:29,388 --> 02:05:32,585
What did you say?
I am your father. I am not dead yet.

505
02:05:33,392 --> 02:05:37,590
The day, you break this relationship,
that day you break this right also.

506
02:05:37,830 --> 02:05:40,663
I won't utter a word. What a
difference between you and him!

507
02:05:45,704 --> 02:05:48,070
Son, I can clearly see
your downfall.

508
02:05:50,643 --> 02:05:53,510
May God forbid me from
seeing that day.

509
02:05:56,415 --> 02:05:59,816
The day I die, he won't even
come for my funeral on time.

510
02:06:01,153 --> 02:06:04,611
Perhaps he might be lying
drunk with his pals...

511
02:06:04,723 --> 02:06:08,523
I won't come for your funeral.
You wanted to hear this, didn't you?

512
02:07:06,285 --> 02:07:08,253
We have a request, sir...

513
02:07:12,257 --> 02:07:14,657
Join us for a garba...

514
02:07:18,297 --> 02:07:20,026
I'll surely come...

515
02:08:15,587 --> 02:08:18,784
How are you Ranvir?
How is your business?

516
02:08:19,091 --> 02:08:20,558
Fine, with your blessings.

517
02:08:20,826 --> 02:08:23,556
How are dad and Biji?
Haven't they come?

518
02:08:30,836 --> 02:08:34,567
Look, I've come here to wish
you, nothing more than that.

519
02:08:34,840 --> 02:08:37,308
Who is he?

520
02:08:39,278 --> 02:08:40,973
The same boy who came
to see Shalini.

521
02:08:43,282 --> 02:08:45,477
He's very handsome.

522
02:08:46,118 --> 02:08:49,576
Looking at him, I feel that
Shalini shouldn't have rejected him.

523
02:08:50,122 --> 02:08:52,818
You feel like that now. But
you were with her then...

524
02:08:53,125 --> 02:08:58,085
Why didn't you make her
understand that day itself?

525
02:08:58,363 --> 02:09:00,354
You're talking as if I've
provoked Shalini to reject him.

526
02:09:04,036 --> 02:09:05,765
O.K. No fights today...

527
02:09:16,548 --> 02:09:18,140
Look, I just can't dance.

528
02:09:18,684 --> 02:09:22,780
Actually it's very simple.
Just follow the rhythm.

529
02:10:39,264 --> 02:10:40,663
I can't see your boyfriend.

530
02:10:41,834 --> 02:10:44,098
We are no longer friends.
- But you were...

531
02:10:44,403 --> 02:10:45,597
To marry him him, right?

532
02:10:46,138 --> 02:10:47,867
He never loved me.

533
02:10:57,916 --> 02:10:59,315
I didn't mean that.

534
02:11:04,790 --> 02:11:06,815
Don't know what goes
wrong with me.

535
02:11:12,664 --> 02:11:17,624
I'm bitter. Maybe because
I've lost faith.

536
02:11:20,606 --> 02:11:25,566
I thought what I saw was the truth.

537
02:11:26,044 --> 02:11:31,004
My eyes beheld what
was actually there.

538
02:11:34,686 --> 02:11:39,646
But that's not true.
Everything is so fake...

539
02:11:40,959 --> 02:11:45,919
As for love, it's just a word.

540
02:11:58,777 --> 02:12:03,111
If I go in, I won't be
able to talk. What to do?

541
02:12:03,215 --> 02:12:04,944
Should I go in or not?

542
02:12:05,150 --> 02:12:08,119
Go on!
- Very well... I'm going.

543
02:12:09,288 --> 02:12:11,188
I'm leaving. Check the
sales stock before going.

544
02:12:16,728 --> 02:12:17,558
You?

545
02:12:18,430 --> 02:12:22,457
What are you doing here?
- I work here.

546
02:12:24,603 --> 02:12:27,572
I never knew that
you work here!

547
02:12:28,307 --> 02:12:30,070
Did you want to buy
something?

548
02:12:30,242 --> 02:12:33,473
Well, yes...
- All right. C'mon.

549
02:12:37,616 --> 02:12:39,345
I didn't know you work here.

550
02:12:40,052 --> 02:12:41,280
What did you want
to buy?

551
02:12:45,824 --> 02:12:46,483
That...

552
02:12:52,531 --> 02:12:53,998
Which one do you like?

553
02:12:54,566 --> 02:12:56,932
It's beautiful.
- Sure it is.

554
02:12:58,570 --> 02:13:01,300
I really didn't know
you work here!

555
02:13:18,357 --> 02:13:20,825
I didn't know
you work here!

556
02:13:41,513 --> 02:13:43,708
You didn't know I work here.

557
02:13:48,186 --> 02:13:49,483
I really didn't know!

558
02:13:54,526 --> 02:13:57,586
What were you playing a parrot
for, with a single line?!

559
02:13:57,763 --> 02:14:02,723
I really didn't know...
but let me talk to her.

560
02:14:03,035 --> 02:14:06,163
Won't you say something to her?
What will you say? Tell me!

561
02:14:07,339 --> 02:14:12,299
What will you say?
- Let me think.

562
02:14:12,544 --> 02:14:16,241
I will say...
- Whom are you talking to?

563
02:14:22,354 --> 02:14:24,015
Where are you going?
- The station.

564
02:14:25,624 --> 02:14:26,181
May I come, too?

565
02:14:34,933 --> 02:14:38,266
Hey, Romeo! Won't you say
something to your Juliet?

566
02:14:38,804 --> 02:14:41,830
Did you say something.
- No. You were saying something.

567
02:14:42,140 --> 02:14:44,199
Looks like we've been
talking to our ourselves.

568
02:14:44,509 --> 02:14:46,409
Not me. It was you.

569
02:14:47,446 --> 02:14:51,712
Would you like some coffee?
There's a nice restaurant ahead.

570
02:14:52,184 --> 02:14:55,347
No thank you. A friend is waiting
for me at the station.

571
02:14:56,655 --> 02:14:58,418
Really? How about
some bhel-puri then?

572
02:15:01,326 --> 02:15:04,921
Two bhel-puris, please.
- Dry? Do I make it hot?

573
02:15:05,897 --> 02:15:09,799
Make it dry and less spicy.
- The same for me.

574
02:15:12,704 --> 02:15:17,664
The owner of a 5-star hotel buys
a girl, bhel-puri to woo her!

575
02:15:18,477 --> 02:15:21,310
You will achieve nothing!
- What thoughts are you lost in?

576
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:23,380
How much?
- Rs.20/-

577
02:15:36,728 --> 02:15:38,320
Great bhel, wasn't it?

578
02:15:38,864 --> 02:15:41,697
Couldn't tell we reached the station.
- Have we?

579
02:15:43,135 --> 02:15:46,400
You're right...
we've made it rather quickly.

580
02:15:47,005 --> 02:15:48,267
I must leave now. Bye.

581
02:15:53,645 --> 02:15:57,479
What nonsense are you talking?!
Say something nice...

582
02:15:59,217 --> 02:16:00,775
Did you say something?

583
02:16:07,325 --> 02:16:10,783
Idiot, you've wasted
today's meeting.

584
02:16:11,096 --> 02:16:16,056
What will you do if you
don't know how to love?

585
02:16:17,669 --> 02:16:20,570
What's wrong, mister?

586
02:16:30,482 --> 02:16:31,073
For me?

587
02:16:43,795 --> 02:16:47,026
I could have given her
a lift in my car!

588
02:16:49,201 --> 02:16:52,898
Lovely flowers.
- Yes, they are...

589
02:16:53,572 --> 02:16:56,541
Ranvir loves you even today.

590
02:16:57,075 --> 02:17:00,533
I've seen that love
in his eyes.

591
02:17:05,083 --> 02:17:10,043
I thought the other one
loved me too. So what happened?

592
02:17:10,722 --> 02:17:14,214
Not only you, but I also
misunderstood him.

593
02:17:14,759 --> 02:17:17,557
That doesn't mean all
boys are the same.

594
02:17:18,163 --> 02:17:19,630
Everybody makes mistakes.

595
02:17:19,731 --> 02:17:23,223
But not everyone gets a chance
to rectify their mistakes.

596
02:17:23,401 --> 02:17:26,234
You are getting one today!
- Forget it, Nisha. Please.

597
02:17:27,339 --> 02:17:29,500
I don't want to discuss
that topic.

598
02:17:37,916 --> 02:17:39,884
Who gave you those flowers?
- Ranvir.

599
02:17:40,852 --> 02:17:44,015
Really? Where did he meet you?

600
02:17:44,689 --> 02:17:47,658
Had he come to meet you?

601
02:17:54,366 --> 02:17:59,326
If accidents could stop life,
the world would've come to an end.

602
02:18:03,508 --> 02:18:08,343
We don't stop dreaming for
fear of nightmares, dear.

603
02:18:09,881 --> 02:18:12,179
But when dreams collide
with reality...

604
02:18:12,384 --> 02:18:15,046
dreams lie shattered, Mom.

605
02:18:15,787 --> 02:18:17,118
I don't wish to be
shattered again.

606
02:18:27,032 --> 02:18:30,490
Where are you going
so early in the morning?

607
02:18:30,735 --> 02:18:32,498
Well...

608
02:18:36,841 --> 02:18:39,935
What are you up to?!
- Nothing, grandma...

609
02:18:42,047 --> 02:18:47,007
Watch out! Have you gone crazy?
Drive the car slowly!

610
02:18:48,353 --> 02:18:50,082
If I drive slowly,
my goal will slide further.

611
02:18:50,322 --> 02:18:52,449
Your goal?
- Right, grandma.

612
02:18:52,624 --> 02:18:54,717
I've had a tough time
tracing it!

613
02:18:54,926 --> 02:18:57,656
Stop talking in riddles!
Where are you taking me?

614
02:18:58,129 --> 02:19:02,657
I'm taking you to a nice place.
- Could it have a name?

615
02:19:05,770 --> 02:19:09,331
Here we are!
- This is a temple.

616
02:19:16,881 --> 02:19:18,974
You're still in the car!
Hurry up, Biji.

617
02:19:22,387 --> 02:19:23,615
Hurry up, Biji!

618
02:19:24,589 --> 02:19:27,422
Idiot! Thank the Lord I can
atleast walk at this age!

619
02:19:28,026 --> 02:19:31,189
What the hell are you doing?!
Let me go!

620
02:19:31,363 --> 02:19:34,764
You've really gone crazy!
- I can't help it, Biji.

621
02:19:38,536 --> 02:19:40,265
Greetings, Biji.
- Greetings.

622
02:19:41,406 --> 02:19:44,432
Biji comes here every day.
She forced me to join her today.

623
02:19:44,676 --> 02:19:46,769
She doesn't go
anywhere without me.

624
02:19:56,054 --> 02:19:58,352
Rama... will you step aside
for a moment?

625
02:20:05,430 --> 02:20:10,390
You've been following me,
isn't it?

626
02:20:11,069 --> 02:20:13,299
It's just that
you're walking ahead.

627
02:20:17,575 --> 02:20:22,376
What do you want?
- To walk with you forever.

628
02:20:26,418 --> 02:20:29,251
I hear you don't go out
anywhere nowadays, dear.

629
02:20:30,922 --> 02:20:33,982
Well, that's not really true...

630
02:20:35,026 --> 02:20:38,894
It's a long time since you went
to the farm house, Ranvir.

631
02:20:39,097 --> 02:20:41,691
I'll go there today, Biji.
May I?

632
02:20:42,233 --> 02:20:47,193
You will go there together.
That's an order!

633
02:20:57,916 --> 02:20:59,508
It's such a beautiful place!

634
02:21:00,051 --> 02:21:01,518
This is the first time I'm visiting these parts.

635
02:21:02,554 --> 02:21:04,283
You've been here several times. - What?

636
02:21:05,190 --> 02:21:07,425
I mean, you've come with me for the first time.

637
02:21:07,425 --> 02:21:09,893
But in my thoughts, you've come here many times

638
02:21:20,438 --> 02:21:22,167
Do you come here often?

639
02:21:22,340 --> 02:21:24,399
Whenever I am tired of my mobile phones
and meetings...

640
02:21:24,576 --> 02:21:27,807
...and when I feel, I am drained
out of my energy...

641
02:21:28,079 --> 02:21:30,309
...I come running here.

642
02:21:49,767 --> 02:21:51,826
It's so calm and peaceful here.

643
02:21:58,510 --> 02:22:01,343
Come in, this is my room.

644
02:22:14,526 --> 02:22:19,486
Whose picture is that?
- That's my mom.

645
02:22:19,797 --> 02:22:24,757
She died, when I was
just eight years old.

646
02:22:28,806 --> 02:22:32,367
You've met dad and Biji
but not my younger brother.

647
02:22:35,813 --> 02:22:36,871
Here he is.

648
02:22:42,820 --> 02:22:45,186
He does appear to be very stubborn.

649
02:22:46,224 --> 02:22:48,784
The pampered kid brother...
how about something to eat?

650
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:50,689
Sure. I'm hungry.

651
02:22:53,231 --> 02:22:55,199
What's that?
- She's churning out the butter.

652
02:22:57,835 --> 02:23:01,293
May I make one? - Go ahead.

653
02:23:08,112 --> 02:23:10,706
The ambience here is so
much like a village.

654
02:23:10,982 --> 02:23:13,815
I have preserved all my
childhood memories here.

655
02:23:17,355 --> 02:23:19,084
Isn't this wheat?

656
02:23:19,624 --> 02:23:22,457
Yes. It'll become golden soon
and be ready for the harvest.

657
02:23:34,272 --> 02:23:36,137
Put it in.

658
02:23:40,178 --> 02:23:42,009
It's eating!

659
02:24:48,146 --> 02:24:50,740
Wish to see an even more beautiful place?

660
02:24:51,149 --> 02:24:53,117
Really? Even more beautiful?

661
02:26:24,442 --> 02:26:26,637
Wear this. Or you'll catch a cold

662
02:32:20,197 --> 02:32:22,433
You're not what you appear to be.

663
02:32:22,433 --> 02:32:25,891
What do you mean?
- You are very heavy.

664
02:32:31,575 --> 02:32:34,669
I've written something.
Will you listen?

665
02:32:46,590 --> 02:32:51,550
I love you a lot;
like the sun who loves its rays...

666
02:32:54,598 --> 02:32:56,691
...like the moon loves its moonlight...

667
02:32:58,335 --> 02:33:02,066
...like the flowers love their fragrance.

668
02:33:05,876 --> 02:33:09,471
Come, let's build our world of dreams.

669
02:33:11,515 --> 02:33:18,353
A place where everything
is really beautiful.

670
02:33:27,398 --> 02:33:32,631
This has nothing written on it!
- Everything is here...

671
02:33:47,818 --> 02:33:52,050
You won't leave ever, will you?

672
02:33:59,463 --> 02:34:03,297
Shall we get married?

673
02:38:42,079 --> 02:38:43,944
What were you doing?

674
02:38:45,849 --> 02:38:47,680
I was doing just what you did.
- What was I doing?

675
02:38:49,086 --> 02:38:51,452
In the swimming pool the other day
...remember?

676
02:38:51,855 --> 02:38:55,552
This is a sea, and not a swimming pool.
You could even die!

677
02:38:56,727 --> 02:39:00,060
You're right, brother.
This is the sea.

678
02:39:01,598 --> 02:39:07,559
You're in love. Aren't you?
- I don't know...

679
02:39:09,506 --> 02:39:12,839
It's her I see everywhere.

680
02:39:13,377 --> 02:39:15,709
I see. Go home and sleep peacefully.

681
02:39:16,013 --> 02:39:18,208
Everything will be all right in the morning.

682
02:39:18,615 --> 02:39:22,711
I see her, even when I close my eyes.

683
02:39:22,953 --> 02:39:24,784
Why don't you take sedatives then?

684
02:39:26,323 --> 02:39:27,915
Brother! - Don't touch me!

685
02:39:28,225 --> 02:39:29,920
I might catch the bug!

686
02:39:34,865 --> 02:39:36,696
Am I really in love?

687
02:39:42,005 --> 02:39:49,605
Yes. But why are you
roaming like a Devdas?

688
02:39:49,880 --> 02:39:51,211
Where is the girl?

689
02:39:58,522 --> 02:40:02,618
She has gone away.
- Gone away?

690
02:40:03,760 --> 02:40:08,493
Doesn't she love you?
- She loves me a lot.

691
02:40:09,266 --> 02:40:11,234
She wanted to marry me, too.

692
02:40:13,036 --> 02:40:16,995
But I insulted her.
Before all my friends.

693
02:40:17,674 --> 02:40:19,733
She stopped coming to college.

694
02:40:21,278 --> 02:40:24,736
I even went to her house
and insulted her father.

695
02:40:27,818 --> 02:40:31,049
I've lost her now. Forever.

696
02:40:35,692 --> 02:40:39,560
What am I to do, brother?
- Go and ask her to forgive you.

697
02:40:39,696 --> 02:40:42,062
Must I seek her forgiveness?! I?!

698
02:40:42,199 --> 02:40:45,102
You love her. Don't it?
- Yes.

699
02:40:45,102 --> 02:40:48,071
It's you who made the mistake.
- Yes.

700
02:40:49,706 --> 02:40:51,936
So it's you who must apologise.

701
02:40:52,976 --> 02:40:55,206
Will she return to me, if I apologise?

702
02:40:55,379 --> 02:41:00,339
Why not? No girl can
ever be upset with for so long.

703
02:41:00,884 --> 02:41:04,081
And look at me.
I'd lost my love too. Hadn't I?

704
02:41:04,621 --> 02:41:05,713
But she's back.

705
02:41:09,526 --> 02:41:10,356
Where to?

706
02:41:11,128 --> 02:41:12,493
- To apologise.
At this hour?!

707
02:41:13,030 --> 02:41:15,498
Go there in the morning.
And dress well before you go.

708
02:41:17,534 --> 02:41:20,367
Let's go home now. C'mon.

709
02:41:20,537 --> 02:41:23,734
You're a swell guy, brother.
You must've been my mom in my last birth.

710
02:41:23,907 --> 02:41:28,105
Do you remember mom?
- A little.

711
02:42:15,192 --> 02:42:17,160
What are you doing in a
ladies compartment?

712
02:42:19,196 --> 02:42:20,026
For you.

713
02:42:28,705 --> 02:42:30,172
You've changed, Rajvir.

714
02:42:33,577 --> 02:42:34,544
What?

715
02:42:36,813 --> 02:42:38,678
It's too late, Rajvir.

716
02:42:44,221 --> 02:42:46,917
I've realised the real
meaning of love.

717
02:42:50,727 --> 02:42:52,558
You wanted me to talk to your parents.
Isn't it?

718
02:42:56,967 --> 02:42:59,060
Now I love someone else.

719
02:42:59,336 --> 02:43:01,930
I know that you're angry with me.

720
02:43:07,377 --> 02:43:11,211
What are you doing?
Try to understand...

721
02:43:11,381 --> 02:43:13,611
What's there to understand?

722
02:43:13,750 --> 02:43:16,617
We both love each other.
You want to marry me.

723
02:43:18,255 --> 02:43:20,223
I love someone else, Rajvir.

724
02:43:21,525 --> 02:43:22,992
We're getting married soon.

725
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:25,352
You can't love anyone else!

726
02:43:26,263 --> 02:43:30,723
You belong only to me!
I love you, I say!

727
02:43:30,901 --> 02:43:32,869
So how can you love someone else?

728
02:43:38,575 --> 02:43:43,535
You belong only to me and nobody
can snatch you away!

729
02:43:46,183 --> 02:43:51,644
I've said it! You belong only to me!

730
02:44:35,599 --> 02:44:38,067
Committing a murder for the first time?

731
02:45:12,969 --> 02:45:14,300
This is Goldie speaking.
- Go on.

732
02:45:14,704 --> 02:45:16,797
Shalini's at Cafe Royal...
- With whom?

733
02:45:17,073 --> 02:45:21,533
I can't tell. You'd better
come and see for yourself.

734
02:45:35,458 --> 02:45:39,554
I'm scared, Ranvir
...terribly afraid.

735
02:45:40,697 --> 02:45:44,793
How often do I ask you not to
get scared, Shalini?

736
02:45:47,470 --> 02:45:48,164
Look at this...

737
02:45:49,706 --> 02:45:53,301
It's very beautiful.
For whom did you buy it?

738
02:45:53,843 --> 02:45:58,803
For the girl who's sitting there.
Give me your hand.

739
02:46:00,116 --> 02:46:02,084
What are you doing?
- Why?

740
02:46:02,352 --> 02:46:06,186
This should be done in the presence of all.

741
02:46:06,723 --> 02:46:07,951
It is called a betrothal.

742
02:46:15,131 --> 02:46:17,599
I am hungry. Shall we order something?

743
02:46:24,240 --> 02:46:32,511
Rocky! What are you doing here?
Come here...

744
02:46:32,916 --> 02:46:35,384
I'll introduce you to Shalini.

745
02:46:42,058 --> 02:46:43,389
He's handsome, isn't he?

746
02:46:44,060 --> 02:46:47,393
He has this effect on people.
He leaves them dumb struck.

747
02:46:52,569 --> 02:46:54,764
Don't just stand there. Come here.

748
02:47:11,087 --> 02:47:13,419
Has that girl rejected your proposal?

749
02:47:15,091 --> 02:47:18,151
Don't worry. We'll go
together and convince her.

750
02:47:29,806 --> 02:47:33,503
Rocky's upset. He seems to have
fought with his girlfriend.

751
02:47:33,910 --> 02:47:36,378
He needs me...
I'll be back soon.

752
02:47:49,325 --> 02:47:51,054
What are you doing, Rocky?!

753
02:47:52,729 --> 02:47:56,927
I don't want anything given by you.

754
02:47:59,602 --> 02:48:00,432
What's wrong with you?

755
02:48:05,608 --> 02:48:10,568
You love me very much, right?
But that's a lie!

756
02:48:11,481 --> 02:48:13,073
It's a lie! A falsehood!

757
02:48:13,983 --> 02:48:18,943
You gave me everything so you could
project yourself as good...

758
02:48:19,355 --> 02:48:21,323
and me as the villain of the piece!

759
02:48:29,766 --> 02:48:34,726
You had promised Mom that you'd give
me all the joys in the world.

760
02:48:35,872 --> 02:48:38,238
You have kept your word indeed!

761
02:48:40,009 --> 02:48:43,877
Rather than have a brother like you,
I should've had no kin!

762
02:48:49,052 --> 02:48:52,510
Don't you ever touch me again!

763
02:48:55,425 --> 02:49:00,385
What will you do?
Will you beat me up?

764
02:49:00,930 --> 02:49:03,899
Will you hit me? Me?!

765
02:49:27,190 --> 02:49:28,521
Are you blind?!

766
02:50:49,606 --> 02:50:51,699
Why are you running away from me?

767
02:50:54,377 --> 02:51:00,077
You're happy, aren you?
Why must you bother!

768
02:51:01,384 --> 02:51:04,581
How can I be happy when you are sad?

769
02:51:05,388 --> 02:51:08,721
Just tell me your problem,
I'll set it right.

770
02:51:10,260 --> 02:51:14,219
How will you set right?
Who do you think you are?

771
02:51:15,131 --> 02:51:22,867
God Almighty?
You can't do anything. Nothing!

772
02:51:24,641 --> 02:51:28,099
Can you stop me from
jumping off this bridge?

773
02:51:30,046 --> 02:51:33,641
You can't stop me!
You can do nothing!

774
02:51:36,452 --> 02:51:41,412
I beg of you, please;
come down.

775
02:51:41,824 --> 02:51:43,792
Have I made a mistake?
Tell me!

776
02:51:46,963 --> 02:51:48,658
Do you really wish to know?

777
02:51:54,771 --> 02:51:59,731
Shalini belongs to me...
Not to you!

778
02:52:39,048 --> 02:52:44,008
Talk to me, Ranvir!
Please talk to me!

779
02:52:53,429 --> 02:52:56,023
Someone, please call for a doctor...

780
02:52:56,833 --> 02:52:59,301
Please save my Ranvir!

781
02:53:00,937 --> 02:53:05,897
Talk to me, Ranvir...
Please talk to me!

782
02:53:15,952 --> 02:53:18,546
So you've done what you promised!

783
02:53:19,722 --> 02:53:22,418
You can't love anyone else, you said!

784
02:53:22,725 --> 02:53:27,685
You're mine! You can't love anyone else,
because I love you!

785
02:53:34,604 --> 02:53:39,564
So you've killed your brother at last.
Haven't you?

786
02:53:39,976 --> 02:53:46,211
You think you've won...
But you've been defeated, Rajvir!

787
02:53:48,217 --> 02:53:51,311
Love is not meant to kill someone.

788
02:53:51,854 --> 02:53:53,947
Love is to let live.

789
02:53:55,091 --> 02:53:58,185
Love is life...
Iove to make the other happy!

790
02:53:58,728 --> 02:54:01,196
But you will never understand these things.

791
02:54:01,497 --> 02:54:06,457
You can never love anyone.
You only know to hate.

792
02:54:08,104 --> 02:54:11,073
But now, everybody will hate
you and say...

793
02:54:11,340 --> 02:54:17,472
...a brother has killed his own brother
because of his obstinacy.

794
02:54:19,015 --> 02:54:26,114
You have killed my Ranvir.
You've killed him!

795
02:55:26,716 --> 02:55:30,709
You can't go in. Don't worry.
He'll be all right.

796
02:55:33,623 --> 02:55:35,215
I want to see my brother Ranvir Singh.

797
02:55:37,393 --> 02:55:38,951
He's just been brought here!

798
02:55:39,395 --> 02:55:41,090
He's being operated upon on the 16th floor.

799
02:55:45,034 --> 02:55:48,765
Instead of a brother like you...
I wish I had no brother at all.

800
02:55:54,043 --> 02:55:57,413
Who do you think you are?
God Almighty?!

801
02:55:57,413 --> 02:55:59,643
You can do nothing!

802
02:56:04,053 --> 02:56:10,686
Can you stop me from jumping
down this bridge?

803
02:56:27,843 --> 02:56:31,677
Calm down, dear...
Ranvir will be fine.

804
02:56:32,448 --> 02:56:34,177
Who's Rocky?
- Me.

805
02:56:34,350 --> 02:56:37,046
The patient had regained consciousness...

806
02:56:37,219 --> 02:56:41,178
but he slipped into a coma, as he shouted
"Rocky don't jump"

807
02:56:41,457 --> 02:56:45,325
How did all this happen,
Rocky? Tell me!

808
02:56:45,861 --> 02:56:50,195
Will my son be okay, doctor?
- I can't say anything.

809
02:57:18,394 --> 02:57:23,354
I am perfectly alright, brother.
Nothing is wrong with me.

810
02:57:26,902 --> 02:57:30,633
I'm okay, brother...
Look at me...

811
02:57:31,674 --> 02:57:33,369
I'm okay... Look!

812
02:57:33,809 --> 02:57:34,776
Can you hear me?

813
02:57:34,910 --> 02:57:36,275
Why are you crying?

814
02:57:39,315 --> 02:57:40,680
Please forgive me...

815
02:57:44,220 --> 02:57:45,551
I've hurt you, brother.

816
02:57:54,964 --> 02:57:57,432
I beat you, got drunk in front of you.

817
02:58:06,976 --> 02:58:16,817
I got drunk and misbehaved with you!

818
02:58:28,130 --> 02:58:33,090
I'm fortunate to have a
brother like you.

819
02:58:33,369 --> 02:58:35,098
And yet, I...

820
02:58:35,371 --> 02:58:37,965
Beat me up, brother. Give me a thrashing!

821
02:58:38,140 --> 02:58:43,100
I'm really bad, brother...
But you must get well soon.

822
02:58:48,751 --> 02:58:53,711
I promise to be good now!
I will be like you.

823
02:58:54,123 --> 02:58:59,083
I will give up smoking and drinking.

824
02:59:00,129 --> 02:59:02,962
But you must get well, brother.

825
02:59:15,277 --> 02:59:19,475
I'm very obstinate. Very stubborn.

826
02:59:19,915 --> 02:59:23,874
No one has ever turned me down.

827
02:59:24,019 --> 02:59:27,113
So, when Shalini said 'no' to me,
I was livid.

828
02:59:28,524 --> 02:59:29,752
I don't love her at all.

829
02:59:31,794 --> 02:59:35,127
It's you I love, Ranvir.
Only you!

830
02:59:35,664 --> 02:59:39,122
Shalini belongs to you, brother.
Not to me!

831
02:59:40,436 --> 02:59:42,768
I belong only to you, Ranvir!

832
02:59:44,440 --> 02:59:45,532
Get up, Ranvir!

833
02:59:46,942 --> 02:59:48,307
Shalini's right, brother.

834
02:59:49,211 --> 02:59:50,678
I love someone else.

835
02:59:51,080 --> 02:59:52,047
She loves me very much.

836
02:59:53,849 --> 02:59:57,410
I want to marry him.
- She wants to marry me.

837
02:59:58,954 --> 03:00:03,186
He loves me very much.
- You love her, don't you?

838
03:00:07,963 --> 03:00:11,023
I see her everywhere.

839
03:00:15,070 --> 03:00:18,164
I see her even when I shut my eyes.

840
03:00:20,342 --> 03:00:21,309
Am I really in love?

841
03:00:26,348 --> 03:00:28,179
If I apologise, will she return to me?

842
03:00:35,724 --> 03:00:40,684
"Take care of Rocky.
Give him all the love and joy"

843
03:00:41,497 --> 03:00:43,732
Will you give him all the happiness?

844
03:00:43,732 --> 03:00:50,570
Yes. Shall I sleep next to you?

845
03:00:52,107 --> 03:00:54,974
My son!

846
03:02:18,294 --> 03:02:23,254
Why are you all crying?
Stop crying. He's okay...

847
03:02:23,565 --> 03:02:25,897
He's only asleep...
he'll wake up soon.

848
03:02:26,001 --> 03:02:30,904
Get up brother... open your eyes.

849
03:02:37,680 --> 03:02:42,640
Shut up! How will he hear me
if you keep crying like this?

850
03:02:43,185 --> 03:02:48,145
Please help me. Dad,
tell brother to get up.

851
03:02:48,424 --> 03:02:52,884
Look, brother... they're all crying.

852
03:02:53,195 --> 03:02:54,890
They think something's wrong with you.

853
03:02:55,197 --> 03:02:59,463
Nothing is wrong with you.
Come on, open your eyes...

854
03:02:59,635 --> 03:03:01,102
C'mon... let's go home.

855
03:03:04,907 --> 03:03:08,570
Didn't I promise to be like you? A good man?

856
03:03:09,578 --> 03:03:15,244
So why don't you get up?
Why're you being stubborn like me?

857
03:03:17,886 --> 03:03:19,319
Why're you hurting everyone?

858
03:03:21,557 --> 03:03:26,517
I know that you can hear me.
Then why don't you get up?

859
03:03:27,363 --> 03:03:30,821
Get up, brother... Wake up!

860
03:03:53,055 --> 03:03:58,015
You snatched my mother from me...
but not my brother, O God!

861
03:03:58,427 --> 03:04:03,387
He's my brother... my brother alone!

862
03:04:07,936 --> 03:04:13,772
You're mine and mine alone.
You can't leave me like this.

863
03:04:18,881 --> 03:04:20,644
I can't live without you.

864
03:04:22,684 --> 03:04:25,585
I've learnt to live without Mom...

865
03:04:27,322 --> 03:04:29,916
But I can't live without you.

866
03:04:34,163 --> 03:04:39,123
I said I'll be like you...
So why don't you listen to me?

867
03:04:50,112 --> 03:04:55,072
I can't afford to lose my mother again, brother.

868
03:04:55,984 --> 03:05:00,944
So please come back... I can't lose you!

869
03:06:00,415 --> 03:06:01,882
Where are you, Rocky?

870
03:06:02,417 --> 03:06:05,875
Are you still sleeping?
Know what time it is?

871
03:06:08,056 --> 03:06:09,182
But where are you?

872
03:06:10,159 --> 03:06:17,031
In our village. As you had told me,
it's the same here.

873
03:06:19,635 --> 03:06:22,331
What happened? - Rocky is in Punjab.

874
03:06:34,850 --> 03:06:37,614
What do you say for beautiful in Punjabi?

875
03:06:38,020 --> 03:06:39,681
"Sohni"...that's what they call a beauty.
