Hey, Ambu.

00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,960
Ambu!

4
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,520
Oh, I am tired of this fellow.

5
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,720
Don't you have anything
else to do?

6
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,520
There is no point in calling him.

7
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,800
He's our son after all,
isn't he?

8
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,880
He won't wake up
until he feels like getting up.

9
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,320
By then, lunch will be ready.

10
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,600
Right.

11
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,920
You are the one who pampered
and spoiled him.

12
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,560
It's a Sunday.

13
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,200

She won't let me sleep
a little more on a Sunday.

17
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,520
Red salute, comrade.
- Red salute. - How are you?

18
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,800
Go. - Shall we.. - Yes, go on..
- He must be sleeping.

19
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,160

- Look at him sleeping.

22
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,160
Pandi, you scoundrel.
- How dare you hang up on me?

23
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,640
Get up!

24
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,120
What? - Get up! - Everyone's here.
- What are you smiling at?

25
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,240
Do you know what time it is?
- Get up now.

26
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,720
Come on, man.

27
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,720
He is such a lazy guy.

28
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,280
We will go there later.
- Go

29
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,560
Why in the morning?
- Brush your teeth.

30
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,800
Enough for now.
Go..

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,920
Does it have enough sugar?
- It's good.

32
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,400
Won't you ride the bike?
- You are riding it.

33
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,040
What is it, man?

34
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,320
Go on.

35
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,920
Hurry up.

I won't give you anything.

71
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,880
You may go on a bus
if there is no fuel in your bike.

When I was your age, I used to go

I will be back then.

What are you doing there?

91

Hurry up.
Freshers will come today.

93
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,640
Do one thing.
Get some petrol in a bottle.

94
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,280
I will do one thing then.
I will go with Buck.

Yes, he's back. - I heard that
he isn't going back.

100
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,080
Yes, he isn't.
- Why?

101
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,360
It's a mess back there.
- Really?

102
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,520
Terrorism, bombs, guns..
It's a mess.

103
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,720
There was a recent explosion.

On top of everything,
they introduced Nitaqat.

106

What is it?
- Nitaqat.

107
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,080
It facilitates employment
only for their citizens.

108
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,360
Oh, I see.

109
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,080
As soon as it was introduced,
he abandoned everything.

110
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,040
He is planning to start
a new business here.

111
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,040
Whatever it is, his return is going
to affect Chakrapani.

How will it affect me?

His house, of which you were
the caretaker..

114
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,320
You used to rent it for birthday
and bachelor parties.

115
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,080
It was your golden goose.
Remember?

116

Now it's all gone.

117

Don't laugh.

Koya, tell me.

It would be you.
- Right?

121
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,080
Did you hear him?
- Yes.

122
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,000
The wanderer is here.

123

Shut up.
Muthappan will thrash you.

I am building my body for it.

Koya, there won't be any beggars

133
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,320
All of them will be screwed.

134

Muthappan, stop wandering

135
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,200

will happen.

Aren't you happy now?

141

What happened, Koya?
What was the ruckus all about?

142
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,040
It was Chakrapani.
The guy doesn't know when to stop.

You may eat.

What is it, Jolly?
- Eat slowly.

151
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,840
The 'Puttu' you are eating
might get stuck in your throat.

152

We went to narrate the script.
- Oh, I see.

153

Did you narrate it?
- No.

154

We roamed around Cochin

My dad wanted to enrol me

Go and sit in the front when
the bus stops at the next stop.

337
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,200

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,320
Such guys somehow make their way

350
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,320
I am going to the toilet.
Are you coming?

I don't sit.

358
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,080
Move your hand.
- Didn't you like it?

359
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,240
You look good.
Handsome. I like you.

360
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,960
Damn.

361
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,280
How dare you do that on a bus?
Pandi, hit him.

Riyas, open the door.
Stop the bus.

363
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,040
I will teach you a lesson today.

364

What happened?
- Do I look good now? - Hit him.

365
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,240
Pandi, thrash him.
- Do you feel good now?

366
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,640
We can't delay it anymore.
Let's go.

Give me the shoe.

Dude.

Dude.
- What?

378
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,520
Don't we, as the natives
of Kozhikode, ensure that

379
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,920
a meal fills not just his stomach
but also his heart?

380
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,240
Our own Kozhikode.

381
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,240
It's raining..
- Even if it's someone who we know.

382
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,320
It will stop soon.

383
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,840
It doesn't matter if we know
this guy or not.

384
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,280
We, the natives of Kozhikode,
love everyone a lot.

385
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,440
'Our own Kozhikode'.
- Yes.

386
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,680
Even though it is like that

387
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,880
some sons of bitches..
Note the point. Sons of bitches.

388
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,280
Noted.

389
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,160
Sons of bitches, did you note it?
- Noted.

Yes, they think..

391
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,280
Come here.
- Yes.

392
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,480
They think that men of Kozhikode
are gay. - Let it go!

393
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,760
They are sons of bitches.

394
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,280
Pandi..
- Yes.

395
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,320
Do you think she thinks I'm gay?

396
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,640
Who?

397
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,480
My girl, Pandi.

398
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,880
Oh, the girl.
No.

399
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,920
I'm sure she wouldn't.

400
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,680
You don't think so, do you?
- No way.

401
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,000
Then again, she might.
- Excuse me?

402
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,080
So what?

403
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,040
Are you gay?
- Pandi!

404
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,880
Well, it's okay even if you are.
There's nothing wrong with it.

405
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,360
But I..

406
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,760
I'm not gay.

407
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,800
Then why are you worried?
- What? - Yes.

408
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,160
Ambu, I give you my word.
- Okay.

409
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,600
I, Pandi..
I mean, I, Ashok Raj, give you

410
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,400
my word that I will get you married

411
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,120
to your girl. Is that enough?
- Yes.

412
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,760
Are you happy?
- Yes. - Okay.

413
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,600
That's enough.

416
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,880
Shall we go?
- Stop!

417
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,040
Let me explain..
- You need not!

418
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,960
You could've called me
at least after you reached.

419
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,040
But no..

420
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,440
It's no wonder they say most
relationships fade away with time.

421
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,920
I am sorry that it happened.
Please forgive me. - Okay.

422
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,440
When do you plan
to visit me?

423
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,960
It's a Sunday tomorrow.
I shall come tomorrow. - Okay.

424
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,760
We have an offering to make
at the temple in the morning.

425
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,480
I'll head straight to
your place after that.

426
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,440
Won't that do? - Okay.
Please bring your family too.

427
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,800
Of course. Why not?
- Will you turn up for sure?

428
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,760
Yes, I will.

429
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,120

Narendran.
Comrade Narendran.

Don't you have
anything else to do? - Hey.

I'm not interested.

437
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,240
We will be visiting
him tomorrow.

438
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,320
Don't expect me.
You may go by yourself.

439
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,080
Let me make this clear.

440
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,200
We will be heading to his place
straight from temple.

441
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,080
By 'we', I mean my wife,
my kids and I.

442
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,080
Stay right here.

It's true!

445
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,160
This isn't the best part.
- Tell us.

446

He wasn't in town when he was
supposed to elope with her.

447
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,240
There was a political
assembly in Madras.

448
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,960
He'd only arrive by the
morning Mangalore Mail.

449
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,360
We also had to get
Ummu out of her house.

That's my younger son.

Has he grown so much?

456
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,800
Oh, damn!
- Hold it right there.

457

What on earth is this?

recognises me.

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,320
There's another one.
- Damn! - You are insane.

481
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,480
In that case, Che Guevera's dad
is insane too.

482
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,840
Oh, God!
Damn!

483
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,120
There.
- Okay, then. - See you.

484
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,280
Let it be then.

485
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,320
Didn't you say we'll get toddy?
- That's true.

486
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,840
But I've got something
even better for you.

487
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,880
Go on then..

488
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,400
Try to meet with Ullas.

489
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,880
Or else, he'll drive me nuts.
- I'd given him a call. - Okay.

490
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,160
I'll visit him.

491
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,760
Be careful at the side.

Her long nose.

493
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,360
Pretty nose.

beautiful smile.

'Lives in Kozhikode, India.'

499
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,480
Pursuing a master's degree would
mean she's older than you.

500
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,640
He is obviously older than her.

501
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,600
He had failed
kindergarten twice. - Pandi!

502
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,360
That's enough.
- Ambu..

503
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,560
Send her a friend request.

504
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,240
No more..
- Geez.

505
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,120
Stop gawking at her and send it.

506
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,120
But isn't this your phone?

507
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,240
Oh. Then use your phone.

508
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,960
But Facebook?
TIMEIN: 00:37:01:16	DURATION: 01:24	TIMEOUT: 00:37:02:40
Will she think I'm cheap?

509
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,800
That's bound to happen anyway.
- What do we do?

510
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,240
If I get her number

511
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,320
will you call her?
- Stop it, Vaka! - I can try.

512
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,320
For whom?
- No, I will call her.

513
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,720
For sure?
- Yes.

514
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,240
Then I can try something.
- What?

515
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,920
Like what?
- Trust me.

516
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,800
What?
- There is a way. - Really?

517
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,520
Hello, Shaji. Hello, ma'am.
I hope you are well.

518
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,120
How is he?
Isn't he too good? - What?

519
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,640
Tea would be fine for us, ma'am.
You may skip the snacks.

520
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,120
We don't have milk.

521
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,880
We know.
Black tea would be fine.

522
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,440
Just make it strong
with extra sugar, ma'am.

523
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,680
What the..
- Maybe add some cardamom.

524
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,120
What the..
- Yeah, right.

525
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,640
Can we have a minute, Shaji?
- What?

526
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,000
Just come.
Come on now.

527
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,280
What is it?
- How have you been?

528
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,120
Take your hands off me.
It's already late.

529
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,640
Shaji, we need your help.

530
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,080
Tell me what the matter is.
- Go on.

531

She is in first year.
My student.

00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,800
What is it?
- I wanted her phone number.

536
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,800
Get up.
- Oh, damn..

537
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,360
Get up!

538
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,920
What do you think of me?

539
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,240
Well..
Being the teacher and student..

540
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,560
So what?

541
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,680
I am a teacher in that college

542
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,000
and not a pimp!

543
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,720
Get out!
- So you won't help us.

544
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,440
Get the hell out of here!
This won't work. - Are you sure?

545
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,640
Yes!
Get the hell out of here!

546
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,840
All right. - Pandi is leaving.
Let's leave too.

547
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,200
What was the name of
your ex-girlfriend?

548
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,080
Sheethal.
Does she know about her?

549
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,160
Look at that.
- Blackmailing?

550
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,040
It's not going to work.

551
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,920
She knows it all.
- Does she know that both of you

552
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,480
had gone to Ooty without
anyone's knowledge?

553
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,040
Does she know about it?
- I don't think so.

554
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,880

So, she doesn't know that.

Please don't.
What do you want?

559
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,960
The number, right?
I will do something about it.

560
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,720
Don't just say it.
You must find a way.

561
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,200
You must get the number
tomorrow. If you don't..

562
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,640
No, I will get it.
It's my word.

Hello, ma'am.

Okay.

We have a small drinking
party at his place.

We just came to invite Shaji.
He was saying

00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,560
that you are quite strict
and won't agree.

570
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,800
When you get to know..
- Enough already.

571
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,560
I spoke for you saying
that you'd agree. Won't you?

Why not?
He will definitely join you.

Okay..

575
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,640
There is no cardamom

Shall we leave?

As discussed, Shaji.

Guruvayurappan College,
Panthirankavu.. - I'm right here.

799
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,880
Let's go!
- Ambu, aren't you coming?
TIMEIN: 00:55:00:44	DURATION: 01:64	TIMEOUT: 00:55:02:08
I am going.

800
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,880
I took my leaves during this
season because I love rain.

801
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,400
Do you think it'll rain?
- It looks clouded.

802
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,200
It might rain when
we reach Kozhikode.

803
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,600
It's so hot. Turn on the AC.
- It's on.

804
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,400
It's not cold.
- Give it some time.

805
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,240
I see that you can't do
without tissues and AC.

806
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,640
He is from Dubai, isn't he?
- Cut it out.

807
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,800
Ambu,
how has it been here?

808
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,920
It's all the same here,
Brother Appu.

809
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,880
Frequent fires at SM Market,
dog menace..

810
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,960
Nothing new.
- That's just great.
TIMEIN: 00:56:00:48	DURATION: 01:36	TIMEOUT: 00:56:01:84
Aren't you in your
senior year, Pandi?

811
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:02,760
What's your next plan?

812
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,680
Oh, God! The same old questions.
- Head straight to Dubai.

813
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,200
A job that pays me lakhs.

814
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,800
With food and accommodation.

815
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,560
A salary in lakhs with
food and accommodation.

816
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,840
That's great.
And then?

817
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,320
I want to marry a girl.

818
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,280
A girl?
- Don't underestimate him.

819
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,440
He has someone in mind.

820
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,520
Pandi? - Isn't that right, Pandi?
- Nothing like that, Appu.

821
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,680
He's kidding. - I see.
- I have approached her.

822
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,880
It might work out.
- What's her name?

823
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,560
Her name is Geethu. - Hey!
- Geethu. - No, Appu.

824
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,200
It's Nidhi. - Nidhi?
- Pandi?

825
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,920
Who is that? - Go on, tell him.
- Tell me! Is it serious?

826
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,120
Yes. - Yeah, right.
It's just one-way.

827
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,440
He hasn't even presented it to her.
Hopeless romantic.

828
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,520
Pandi.
- When did this happen and how?

829
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,400
There's nothing much to it, Appu.
- Seriously?

830
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,160
Shall I tell him?
- That's enough, Pandi.

831
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,960
Ummu! - Yes!
- He is here! Come out!

832

- We reached. - Okay.

834
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,120
Hello? - Kaka.
- Where are you?

835
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,520
At Ambu's place. Why?
- Come with him to Koya's place.

836
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,560
Ask him to come.
- Vaka and I are here.

837
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,760
What's the matter? - What?
- It's huge.

838
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,160
We'll talk after you reach.

839
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,960
It's serious.
- It is serious.

840
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,120
That's it. - Don't be late.
- No, I won't.

841
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,560
Bye.
- Bye.

842
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,160
Ambu.
- Yes.

843
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,760
It's Kaka. Something serious.
We need to be at Koya's.

844
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,280
Mom, we're going to Koya's.

845
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,240
Eat something first!
- We'll be back soon.

846
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:52,160
"After I saw you that day"

847
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:57,320
"I came to know what love was."

848
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:02,680

what pain was."

other that day"

00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:17,280
"I got to know my
soul's happiness."

851
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:20,520
"I came to know.."
- Will you stop that music?

852
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,280
What? Okay.
- "I got to know."

853
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,920
What do we do now?
- What can we?

854
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,200
Ambu, let her go.

855
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,520
We'll find you another one.
- Vakka, cut it out!

856
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,520
Ambu, why are you
getting depressed?

857
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,240
She's not yet married.

858
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,640
A guy just came and saw her.
That's it.

859
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,880
What if she ends up liking him?
It'll all be over!

860
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,640
What if he didn't approve of her?
- Exactly.

861
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,120
Who wouldn't?
- I didn't approve of her.

862
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,640
Vakka!
- I didn't like her.

863
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,320
Ambu, don't think
of negative things.

864
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,160
First, confess your
feelings to her.

865
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,400
Then we shall take
care of the rest.

866
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,800
What if she says she likes him
and not me? - That's for later!

No!
Put the glass down.

868
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,480
You took one from here recently.

869
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,720
No wonder love
makes people crazy.

870
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,720
Turn on the music, Koya!
That'd be better.

871
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,680
Okay.
- 'My dear citizens..'

872
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:14,960
'I hope..'

873
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,480
Come..

874
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,200
Shall we ring the bell?
- Go on.

875
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,240
You are sure about this, right?
- Of course.

876
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,480
Damn!

877
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,880
Hi.

878
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:29,920
Hey!

Look who is here.
Please come in.

Remove your shoes!

884
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:45,960
Such decency.

885
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,440
Please sit.
- Thank you.

886
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,240
Take a seat.

887

Who is your friend?

Better wait until she completes
her studies. - Right.

891
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:06,120
Where's your mother?
- She has a headache.

892
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,360
A headache?
- Yes.

893
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:11,000
Please wait.
I'll be back in a minute. - Okay.

894
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,240
Thank you.

895
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,120
It's good!
- Kiddo, what's your name?

896
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,000
Why do you want to know?

897
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,240
Nidhi.. - Just to know, dear.
- Dear, my foot!

898
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:31,320
Is this how you behave
with elders? Say sorry. - No.

899
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,440
It's okay.
Isn't it?

900
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,200
No. - What?
- It isn't okay.

901
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,560
Leave it, buddy.

902
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,920
You can say that.
I was the one humiliated.

903
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,160
Hey!

904
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,960
It's nothing. - Vimala has
a headache. - Oh.

905
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,320
She's resting.
That's why she didn't show up.

906
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,200
Let her get some rest.

907
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,080

But her brother, that shorty..

911
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,200
Be wary of him. - Are you still
thinking about that?

912
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,800
And I doubt if her mother
really has a headache.

913
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,000
Don't just doubt it.
She had no headache.

914
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,360
She just didn't like our visit.

915
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,480
You felt that too, didn't you?
- Yes. - Same here.

916
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:19,160
We will change her gradually.
- Yes, we'll try.

917
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,120
Aren't you happy?
- Yes.

918
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:25,000

anything to tell me?

Yes.

my legs will tremble.
I'll have a lump in my throat.

936

My heart will start pounding.

937
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,200
That isn't for lack of courage.

Nidhi.

Mr. Vinod, after meeting
your daughter

972

that guy is adamant
about marrying her.

973
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:44,440
She's still pursuing her studies,
Chakrapani. How can we..

974
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:48,040
Let her. They just want
to get them engaged.

975
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:51,600
We can demand that the wedding be
conducted after a couple of years.

976
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,160
That's not the only issue.

977
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:56,720
That guy is almost 12 years
older than her. What about..

978
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,120
Is that even a problem?

979

981

I will definitely blame you.

982
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,480
Vinod, they are a high-caste
family. They are affluent too.

983
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,680
That boy isn't half bad.

984
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,320
I think this is a good
marriage alliance.

985
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:22,600
What should I tell them, Vinod?
- That I didn't like him. - Nidhi!

986
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,320
Mom, I didn't like him.
- Nobody asked you!

Get back inside. - This is my life.
I have a say in it.

Chakrapani, you're responsible
for everything.

990

Don't you have better things to do?
Did I ask you to play matchmaker?

991
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,440
I'll get going.

992
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:42,360
Make a decision and inform me.

993
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,760
I'll tell you when I am ready
to get married.

994
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,320
Or I will marry the man I like.

995
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,640
Nobody needs to put their nose
in it. - Bye, sir.

996
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,640
What the heck!
I'll come back soon.

997

It's just the alarm.

1000
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,600
Times have changed.
Well, it was for the better.

1001
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,760
Don't forget. It's the 12th
of next month. - Sure.

1002

Everyone should come.
- We'll be there. - Tell Ambu too.

I will.

Why did you go to Vinod's house?
He was here. He just left.

What was it?
- Did he come to tell you that?

1010

Don't you know Nidhi,
Vinod's daughter? - Yes, Nidhi.

01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:17,760
I'll try to make it by morning.
Ask him to wait. - Hey, wait! Hey..

1108
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,080
What happened?
- He hung up.

1109
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,680
What did he say?
- He asked the SI to wait.

1110
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,320
It seems he's busy and he'll
try to make it by tomorrow morning.

1111
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,360
Oh, is he so arrogant!

1112
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,000
Hey, go and answer the door.

1113
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:51,200
Costly liquor!
- The guy in the blue T-shirt.

1114
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,080
Imported cigarettes.

What's happening here?
TIMEIN: 01:18:03:56	DURATION: 02:56	TIMEOUT: 01:18:06:12
What is that? Chicken or mutton?
- Mutton, sir.

1116
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:08,800
I can't, sir..

1117
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:15,160
Mr. Kumaran, try tasting it.
- Sir, I am fasting.

1118
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,760
Yes.. You're correct.

1119
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:25,120
There isn't enough onion.
Try adding more onion.

1120
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,440
It'll be tasty.

1121
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,680
Hey, man with the chain.
- Sir?

1122
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:30,880
Catch it.

1123
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,880
What are you doing?
Dice it finely.

1124
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,480
Okay? - Okay.
- Dice it.

1125
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,960
What are you waiting for?
- I will do it, sir.

1126
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:42,360
Sir, what's happening here?
What's going on?

1127
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:45,040
Then you must be Vijay Babu.
- Yes, sir.

1128
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,960
You seem to be a busy man.

1129
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:49,240
You won't come
to the police station

1130
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:52,000
and you want me to stay back
at the station.

1131
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,600
Isn't that right?
- Yes, sir.

1132
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,040
I took it to my heart.

1133
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:00,720
Vijay, there's a thin line
separating my two lives.
TIMEIN: 01:18:57:64	DURATION: 03:08	TIMEOUT: 01:19:00:72
Vijay, there's a thin line
separating my two lives.

1134
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,080
On that side of the line,
I am a good guy.

1135
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,960
But on this side,
I am a demon.

1136
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:09,200
Got it? - That was great!
- Sir, what do you want?

1137
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:14,320
These four guys are coming from..

1138
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:18,320
Ko.. - Which is that place?
- Kozhikode. - Yes.

1139
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:21,480
They came from Kozhikode
to tell you something important.

1140
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:23,480
Isn't that right, Pandi?
- It is, sir.

1141
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,080
You should give them an ear,
shouldn't you?

1142
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:28,960
Ambu, go and talk things out
with him.

1143
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:30,280
Okay, sir.

1144
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,000
Go with him.
- Sir..

1145
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,440
Don't hesitate, sir.

1146
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:37,400
Come.

1147
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,160
Hey, man with the chain.
- Sir..

1148
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:42,640
What are you staring at?
Dice it. - I will, sir.

1149
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:48,000
What's the matter? - Aren't you
getting engaged next month, man?

1150
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:52,160
Yes, what about it?
- It's not going to happen, man.

1151
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:53,920
Really? Why would that be?

1152
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:55,720
Actually, man..

1153
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,880
Isn't your fiancee's name Nidhi?

1154
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,520
Yes, it's Nidhi.
TIMEIN: 01:20:00:04	DURATION: 01:40	TIMEOUT: 01:20:01:44
Mr. Vinod is Nidhi's father.

Mr. Vinod's best friend,
Mr. Narendran, is Ambu's father.

1156
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,160
Don't beat around the bush.

1157
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:11,120
Sir, I love Nidhi.

1158
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,640
Oh, Vinod, it's you.

1159
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:38,400
You've brought Chakrapani along.

1160
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:39,760
Please come in.
- No.

1161
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,680
You seem to be at unease.

1162
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,640
Well, I am at unease. My daughter's
wedding was called off.

1163
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,560
Cancelled would be a better word.

1164
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:52,080
Your son, Ambu, and his friends
told the groom's family

1165
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:54,840
that Mr. Vinod's daughter
is in love with him.

1166
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,360
They asked them to back out.

1167
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,240
There's a limit to everything.

1168
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,680
How dare they gamble
with a girl's life!

1169
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,280
Vinod, things have turned out
like this.

1170
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:05,880
Don't worry.

1171
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,560
We can think about it and..
- What's there to think about?

1172
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,000
I didn't ask your opinion.

1173
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,480
Vinod, hear me out.

1174
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,560
My son and your daughter.

1175
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:21,000
Isn't it good to be a family?

1176
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,480
Your son is a wrong choice
for my daughter.

1177
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,640
You're cunning.

1178
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,720
What good quality
can your son claim of?

1179
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:30,200
He has a few idiotic friends,
and his ironic name, Ernesto.

1180
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,360
He's studying commerce
at an arts college.

1181
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:33,720
Who wants him?

1182
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,640
Forget all that. What's his
caste? What about religion?

1183
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:40,480
Do you expect me to marry my girl
off to a vagrant with no identity?

1184
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,280
Vinod, don't talk nonsense.

1185
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,320
There's no use getting angry.

1186
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,680
You should've known that your
children would get no respect

1187
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:51,560
when you married someone without
considering religion and caste.

1188
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:54,200
Such nuisances.

1189
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:56,640
Appu, kick him out!

1190
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,040
You bloody..
- Let go of me.

1191
01:21:58,240 --> 01:21:59,680
I will..

Get in.

1193
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,400
I'm leaving.

1194
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:12,880
I sever all the ties between us
right now.

1195
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,760
Everything ends today.

1196
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,320
I'll get my hands
on your brother.

1197
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:23,320
We will see that.

1198
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,520
What the..
- Oh, God!

1199
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,800
What's wrong with you?
- Hello. - Gosh!

1200
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:41,160
Yes, Brother Appu.

1201
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:43,840
We don't know the exact place.
It'll take a few more hours.

1202
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:45,960
What?

1203
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:47,480
When?

1204
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:57,560

Hey.

Hey, we're in for trouble.

Come on.

1214
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:50,360
Go ahead and eat.

1215
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:56,760

I am sorry.

1219
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:15,600
I never bothered
to ask my sons.

1220
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,560
I never had to.

1221
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:23,680
But I think I should ask you now.

1222
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:26,600
It's not a mere thought.
I must ask you.

1223
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,160
What is it, comrade?

1224
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:32,000
Appu, Ambu

1225
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:38,000
we didn't raise you as per
any religious or caste doctrine.

We have never felt it was wrong.

1227

Have you?
- No.

No.

You'll never feel so.

But in the future, if you feel we
brought you up without an identity

1234
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:08,120
and that it was a bad thing to do

1235
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,120
if you get angry at us

1236
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:14,160
that'll be saddening.

1237
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:17,640
That will make me emotional.

01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:20,840
Comrade

1239
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:23,680
bringing us up
without religion and caste

1240
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:26,080
was the best thing you did for us.

1241

Isn't that so, Ambu?
- Yes.

1242

The sons of comrade Narendran
and Ummu.

1243

That's our identity.

We have no existence without you.

Am I going to fight a war

You father-in-law-to-be

1262

shouldn't have spoken ill

1263
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:34,440
Is that the only problem?

1264
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:36,480
You aren't concerned
about him abusing my family.

1265
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,360
I know. Even you are casteist.

You, too, will abuse us soon.

Don't go too far, Ambu!
I'll hurl abuses at you.

1268
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:50,120
You'll find Englishmen in England
and the French in France.

1269
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:53,040
But in India, you will find Tamils,
Telugus, Punjabis and Bengalis

1270
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:56,240
and Hindus, Muslims and Christians.
You'll find no Indian here.

1271
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:57,600
I've heard it somewhere.

1272
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:00,920
This is Mammootty's line
from the movie 'Vartha'.
TIMEIN: 01:26:57:68	DURATION: 03:24	TIMEOUT: 01:27:00:92
This is Mammootty's line
from the movie 'Vartha'.

1273
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,680
So what?
Isn't that the truth?

1274
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:08,640
So you need not worry about
what he said about your parents.

1275
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,480
This land is cursed that way.

1276
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,560
But is it comparable to what he
said about the commerce degree?

1277
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:18,120
Consider the case of this state,
this country or the world.

1278
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,080
Which is the most
sought-after course ever?

1279
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,880
Which is it?
- The commerce degree.

1280
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:23,560
Who has the most number of kids?

1281
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:25,160
Again, commerce graduates.

1282
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:28,320
Even engineering graduates
are working in banks.

1283
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:31,040
Who is that job meant to go to?
Commerce graduates.

1284
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:35,480
Aren't commerce graduates needed to
evade tax and make illegal money?

1285
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,120
Of course, they're needed.

1286
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:40,640
This country will be in shambles
without commerce graduates.

1287
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:44,200
And yet, he dared to shame
commerce graduates.

1288
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:46,160
Do you expect me to stay silent?
Tell me.

1289
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:47,840
Answer me.
- Had enough?

1290
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:51,120
Yes. - Then shut up
for a while.

1291
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:53,960
What a bore!

1292
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:56,720
After all, her wedding
got cancelled.

1293
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:58,800
Thank goodness.
TIMEIN: 01:28:01:44	DURATION: 02:72	TIMEOUT: 01:28:04:16
Give it to me. I'll light it.
- No, I'll do it myself.

1294
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:09,240
It's time. Come on.

1295
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,160
Shucks!
Even that went out!

1296
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,560
Here, right here.

1297
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,160
Come.
- Here.

1298
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:29,640
T A M I L R O C K E R S . C O M

1299
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,120
Be careful while you jump.

1300
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:39,680
Are lovers expected
to jump over walls?

1301
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,160
Shut up!

1302
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,520
You really had to come
in the rain!

1303
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,360
No one will notice us
when it's raining.

1304
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:48,080
Where do you learn these things?

1305
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:53,320
Push me up!
TIMEIN: 01:29:21:20	DURATION: 01:68	TIMEOUT: 01:29:22:88
Buddy.
- What is it?

1306
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:27,320
This guy..

1307
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:30,480
Hey, they'll wake up!

1308
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:37,080
Oh, God!
TIMEIN: 01:30:05:20	DURATION: 02:24	TIMEOUT: 01:30:07:44
You deserve a slap!
You would've spoilt everything now!

1309
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,920
What did she say? - Nothing.
It was her mother who woke up.

1310
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:12,520
What about her?
- She was sleeping.

1311
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:13,760
What?
- Let her sleep.

1312
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:17,800
Hey, then why did we come here?
- What?

1313
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,400
No reason.
Just to see her once.

1314
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:22,920
It's been three days
since I saw her.

1315
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,120
What would happen if you
don't see her for three days?

1316
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:29,800
Did you get me drenched in the rain
for this? Scoundrel!

1317
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:30,960
I am a lover boy, dear!

1318
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:33,000
Why should I suffer for that?

1319
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:44,120
You didn't say anything, dear.

1320
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:47,720
I will. But before that, I want
to speak to Nidhi.

1321
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,080
Do you have a problem with that?

1322
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:53,880
No problem.
I'll call her. - Okay.

1323
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:57,440
Nidhi.. - It's okay, ma'am.
You don't have to call her down.

1324
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:59,280
I'll go and meet her.

1325
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:01,960
It's the first room to the right,
upstairs. - Okay.

Thank you.
- Okay.

1327
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:09,360
Oh, God!

1328
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,200
Nidhi.
- Yes?

1329
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:18,600
May I come in?

1330
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,120
It's a nice room.

1331
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,160
He didn't tell me the matter.

1332
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:33,040
He just asked me
if we could meet.

1333
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,760
Let him come.
We'll wait.

1334
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:38,120
Hey! Hey, Ambu.

1335
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:48,960
Have you been waiting for long?
- No.

1336
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,920
Since you asked us to be here
at 4 p.m., we arrived at 3:30 p.m.

1337
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,360
Now, the time is 5:30 p.m.

1338
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:53,800
It's just been two hours.
That's all.

1339
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:54,800
Sorry, guys.

1340
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,360
I was a bit busy.

1341
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:57,880
My wedding got fixed in haste.

1342
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:59,280
Oh!
- So, I was held up.

1343
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:00,800
Awesome!
- Is your wedding already fixed?
TIMEIN: 01:31:59:36	DURATION: 01:44	TIMEOUT: 01:32:00:80

Yes. - Congrats!
- Thank you.

1345
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:06,720
Because of you all,
I came to know everything.

1346
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:10,080
Or else, things wouldn't have
happened this fast.

1347
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:12,160
Thank you, Ambu. - It's okay.
- Thanks a lot.

1348
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:15,280
So, when is your wedding?
- 12th of this month.

1349
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,960
Hey, that means, just ten
more days! - Yes.

1350
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:20,520
Wow! Awesome! - Aren't you
inviting us to your wedding?

1351
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:21,960
I came here to invite you all.
- Oh!

1352
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:23,280
Hey, get me the wedding card.

1353
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:24,960
What is wrong with you, Pandi?

1354
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:26,280
Just for food.
- We'll get free food!

1355
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:28,040
So cheap! - You need not come.
We'll go.

1356
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:29,400
All of you must come.
- Wow!

1357
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:31,320
Beautiful card, isn't it?
- Yes. - It looks brilliant.

1358
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:32,240
Very nice.

1359
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,920
Nidhi V. Pillai.
Why?

1360
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:50,040
Ambu's father is Narendran.

1361
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:51,760
Narendran's best friend
is Vinod, right?

1362
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,800
Nidhi is Mr. Vinod's daughter.

1363
01:32:58,560 --> 01:32:59,880
I saw many girls.
TIMEIN: 01:33:00:56	DURATION: 02:40	TIMEOUT: 01:33:02:96
In the end, when I found
an apt girl to marry

1364
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:04,640
you came in as a troublemaker.

1365
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:07,040
What else could I have done?

1366
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,880
Hey, just think about it.
Don't you pity me?

1367
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,240
She doesn't want you.

1368
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,080
She agreed to marry me.

1369
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:15,880
Why do you need a girl
who doesn't like you?

1370
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:17,240
Forget her!

1371
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,880
Nidhi.. She is a smart girl.

1372
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:22,960
When she had to choose

1373
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,360
she just chose the better guy.

1374
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,160
Just consider it that way.

1375
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:30,760
Dear, if one love fails,
find another one.

1376
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,480
If that also fails, find another
one. So, just move on.

1377
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:36,920
But don't try to return

1378
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,200
and create more problems again.
Is that clear?

1379
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:44,640
Well, see you at my wedding.
- Hey, no! - Hey..

1380
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,240
He got upset.
Shall we leave? - Yes.

1381
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:56,880
Hey, Ambu!

1382
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:58,760
Hey, Ambu, listen to me.

Hey, where are you going?
- Ambu, stop.

1386
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,920
Stop there, Ambu..
- Hey, listen!

Hey!
TIMEIN: 01:35:15:00	DURATION: 01:60	TIMEOUT: 01:35:16:60
Why didn't you answer my call?

1388

Nothing.
- Okay.

1389
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:20,880
Everyone will be at the ground now.

1390
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:23,120
Get ready soon.
We'll leave.

1391
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:25,120
Okay?
- I'm not coming.

1392
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:28,320
What is this?

1393
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:31,160
Hey..

1394
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:35,160
It's not fun without you.

1395
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,200
It's so boring.

1396
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:38,920
Nobody is enthusiastic
about anything!

1397
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:42,040
Get on the ground,
play a game

1398
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:44,200
and you will be fine. - Hey,
I don't want to come, Pandi!

1399
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,760
Don't irritate me!
Leave me alone.

1400
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:48,680
Am I irritating you?

1401
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:51,760
So, that's what I mean to you.

1402
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:54,640
Okay.
I am happy to hear that.

1403
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:56,600
Hey, try to understand
my situation.

1404
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:58,520
I can't do it.
TIMEIN: 01:36:00:92	DURATION: 01:28	TIMEOUT: 01:36:02:20
I don't feel good.

If you sit here alone,
how will you feel good?

1406
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,640
Just listen to me.

1407
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:09,800
At least for my sake.
Come on.

1408
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:12,160
Hey, what's the matter?

1409
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:13,680
Look at him, Appu.

1410
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,360
He is not even agreeing
to play a game.

1411
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,160
Convince him.
- Hey, what happened?

1412
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:19,920
I'm not feeling well, Brother.
- What's wrong with you?

1413
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:21,120
Everything is fine.

1414
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:24,520
Hey, get ready. I'll also join
you today. - Are you sure?

1415
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:26,560
Why? Won't you include me?
- Of course!

1416
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:28,200
Come on! We'll have a good
time today.

1417
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:29,920
Get up. Come!

1418
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:32,440
Come on!
- Come.

1419
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:45,680
We'll definitely have
a tiff today.

1420
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,520
Hey, why are you standing here?
Let's go.

1421
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,200
There is another gang
playing on the ground.

1422
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:52,440

What's the problem, Pandi?

So what? Let's play together.
- Okay.

1430

Ask them if they're willing
to play a match. - Yes.

I don't think they'll be ready
to play with us.

Listen to me.

Oh, it was them..

1441
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,160
That's the reason I tried

Come.

01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:23,000
Nidhi.

1578
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:24,760
Nidhi.

Nidhi.

1581
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:29,240
Can't you answer me
when I am calling for you?

1582
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:30,360
Nidhi!

1583
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:32,920
Why are you sitting
here all alone?

1584
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:36,600
It's nothing. - Here. It's Vijay.
- I don't want to talk to him.

1585
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:38,280
Talk to him.

1586
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:39,360
Come on.

1587
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:40,640

noticed anything there yet.

What is it? - Don't shout.

1605
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:31,360
I came to see someone.

1606
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:32,400
Who?

1607
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:33,320
Well..

1608
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:36,600

I'll find you
wherever you hide.

1612

Nonsense!

Come soon.

1619

Pandi has been trapped.

How can I go out?

1621

What? - How can I go out?
- How would I know that?

1622

Why do you ask me?

1623
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:15,400
I don't know.

1624
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:16,560
Neither do I.

1625
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:18,920
What?
- I said, neither do I know.

1626
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:19,800
Nice!

01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:32,960
Move over.

1629
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:46,040
Sasi, come soon.

1630
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:49,640
Let's go.
- Did mom get in the car? - Yes.

1631
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:52,200
It's good that we came here.

1632
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,360
Why are they going there?

1633
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:59,880
Who is it? - I checked if it was
my friend from Dubai.
TIMEIN: 01:55:00:76	DURATION: 00:84	TIMEOUT: 01:55:01:60
Geethu.

1634

Geethu.

What is it? - I had submitted
an application. - What?

01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:08,960
A-A love letter.

1637
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:11,640
So what? - You didn't
give me your reply. - Now?

1638
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:17,960
Yes.

1639
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:20,240
Did you say 'Yes'?

1640
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:22,640
Geethu.. Thanks.
- Move!

1641
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:23,920
Oh..

1642
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:26,960
Why did you say 'Yes'?
- Oh, it's not that.

1643
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:28,480
I found a way to get you out.

Oh! Yes.

Come.

1646
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:37,800
Those lights will
be turned off now.

1647
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:42,680
What are you looking at?

1648
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:43,960
You said that the lights
will go off.

1649
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:44,960
Oh!

1650
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:46,960
I meant that I will turn them off.

1651
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:52,000
Will you turn them off?
- Do you want to get out?

1652
01:55:52,640 --> 01:55:53,760
Well

1653
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:56,280
I feel like leaving.

1654
01:55:56,640 --> 01:55:58,240

You must get out then.

1658
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:06,720
Okay?

1659
01:56:08,840 --> 01:56:10,360
Did you understand anything?

1660
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:12,560
What? - Did you understand
anything?

1661
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:14,840
Next is the kitchen.

1662
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:17,120
Where are you going, Son?
- Mom, live..

1663
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:18,760
Did you have supper?
- No.

You are always playing

Come here.
Have something.

1666

Come and have
something to eat. Come.

1667
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:26,520
I haven't stopped the video, Mom.

1668
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:30,960
Hey.

"Everyone's beloved.."

1671
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:43,600
Did you have anything?

1672
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:46,360
Dad.
- Can I have my phone, Mom?

1673
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:49,160
Come here. - I don't need anything.
- What is it, dear?

1674
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:52,400
What happened?

1675
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:54,960
Talk to me.

I don't like him.
I won't be happy.

1678
01:57:05,320 --> 01:57:06,680
That is just your imagination.

1679
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:09,360
When you start living with him

1680
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:11,480
everything will be fine.
- No, Dad.

1681
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:13,920
When I love someone
with all my heart

1682
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:15,960
how can I live with someone else?

1683
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:17,720
I can't do it.

1684
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:22,480
Dad, it's Ambu.

Please.

1689
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:32,200
Ambu! Nonsense!

1690
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:34,080
You better forget him.

1691
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:36,520
That will be good for everyone.

1692
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:39,720
He doesn't deserve you.
He has no caste, religion or money.

1693
01:57:40,280 --> 01:57:41,680
If I marry you off
to someone like him

1694
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:44,200
what will I say to our
family and the townsfolk?

1695
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:47,400
Is that more important
than my life?

1696
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:49,200
I don't want to hear anything.

1697
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:53,840
Even after all this, that idiot
Vijay is still willing to marry you.

What are you saying?

01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:32,640
I heard that you were forcing
your daughter to get married.

02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:23,800
The bride's family have
started a live video.

1742
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:27,280
Doesn't he know
how to hold a phone?

1743
02:00:28,240 --> 02:00:30,880
Like this..
He is running around.

1744
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:33,040
Kuttan. - Yes?
- Did you have anything?

1745
02:00:33,120 --> 02:00:35,440
No. - You are always playing
with this phone.

1746
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:37,600
Mom. - Come and have something
to eat.

1747
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:40,360
Come. You are loitering
around with this.

1748
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:41,960
How can you starve all the time?

1749
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:43,520
A stupid selfie stick!

1750
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:44,640
Let it stay here.

1751
02:00:47,480 --> 02:00:48,760
Did you have something?

1752
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:50,800
Dad. - Can I have
my phone, Mom?

1753
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:53,760
Come. - I don't need anything.
- What is it, dear? - Buddy.

1754
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:55,720
She has come.
- Yes..

1755
02:00:56,600 --> 02:00:58,400
Can you call off this wedding?
TIMEIN: 02:01:00:36	DURATION: 01:44	TIMEOUT: 02:01:01:80
Buddy.
- I don't want him.

1756
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:04,760
I don't like him.
I won't be happy.

1757
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:07,480
When I love someone
with all my heart

1758
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:09,600
how can I live with someone else?

1759
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:11,320
I can't do it.

1760
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:15,960
Dad, it's Ambu.

1761
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:18,120
I love him, Dad.

1762
02:01:18,760 --> 02:01:19,560
I love him.

1763
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:21,040
I don't want to hear anything.

1764
02:01:21,160 --> 02:01:25,000
Even after all this, that idiot
Vijay is still willing to marry you.

1765
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:29,120
Please marry him.

1766
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:36,640
This was fixed once.

1767
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:40,440
This is the second..

1768
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:42,200
I don't think this will happen.

1769
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:45,920
Even after all this, that idiot
Vijay is still willing to marry you.

1770
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:47,800
Pity. Increase the volume.

1771
02:01:48,680 --> 02:01:49,960
I don't want him.

1772
02:01:55,360 --> 02:01:57,160
No one can be
trusted these days.
TIMEIN: 02:02:02:64	DURATION: 01:16	TIMEOUT: 02:02:03:80
Don't make fun.

1773
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:05,560
Shall we share it?

1774
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:08,080
If she likes him

1775
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:09,880
we should let them live together.

1776
02:02:10,120 --> 02:02:12,800
Share the link with me.
- I don't want him.

1777
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:16,560
Come and have something to eat.
- Mom.

1778
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:18,280
Did you have anything to eat?

1779
02:02:18,360 --> 02:02:19,520
I won't be happy.

1780
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:20,720
I don't want him.

1781
02:02:22,600 --> 02:02:23,400
Did you get it?

1782
02:02:26,280 --> 02:02:27,680
Hey.. - Where?
- Let me see.

1783
02:02:29,480 --> 02:02:31,480
Ambu.
What is it?

1784
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:34,280
Look. - I'll watch it.
- Facebook live.

1785
02:02:36,360 --> 02:02:37,360
Oh!

1786
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:43,840
Let's see what they will decide.
Pity.

1787
02:02:57,080 --> 02:02:58,400
I can't hear anything.
TIMEIN: 02:03:13:56	DURATION: 01:48	TIMEOUT: 02:03:15:04
Damn. I have lost my high.

1788
02:03:42,360 --> 02:03:43,240
She'll say it now.

1789
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:45,480
I love him, Dad.
- Did you hear that?

1790
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:46,480
I love him.

1791
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:48,080
Once more.

1792
02:03:48,680 --> 02:03:49,960
I love him, Dad.

1793
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:54,480
If you lose, you should try again.

1794
02:03:55,200 --> 02:03:56,880
You should try till you succeed.

1795
02:03:57,240 --> 02:04:01,040
You should keep marching forward.
TIMEIN: 02:03:57:24	DURATION: 03:80	TIMEOUT: 02:04:01:04
You should keep marching forward.

1796
02:04:01,120 --> 02:04:03,440
Hello. - Vijay. - Hello.
Enough. - Kishore.

1797
02:04:03,640 --> 02:04:04,800
Come. - Give us
a moment.

1798
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:06,040
What all have you done?

1799
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:09,120
Football matches.
Punchlines at the beach.

1800
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:12,200
At least when I came to know
that she reads a lot of books..

1801
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:13,800
Why are you taking so long?
- I should've stepped back. - Come.

1802
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:14,760
One moment!

1803
02:04:16,760 --> 02:04:17,800
Are you leaving or not?

1804
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:19,240
It's my father's mistake.

1805
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:22,480
I won't interfere henceforth.
- Okay.

1806
02:04:23,560 --> 02:04:24,400
Goodbye.

1807
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:28,080
I hope to see you guys soon.
- Okay. - We'll meet at the ground.

1808
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:29,520
Great.

1809
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:33,280
Play it once more.
- Enough. Shall we leave?

1810
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:34,120
Shall we leave?

1811
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:35,680
Come. I'm very hungry.

1812
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:37,440
Shall we have 'Puttu'?

1813
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:39,760
That's a nice idea.
Great.

1814
02:04:41,720 --> 02:04:46,120
'After a few days..'

1815
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:56,360
We're running out
of time, Mr. Sunny.

1816
02:04:56,440 --> 02:04:57,240
Wait for some time.

1817
02:04:57,320 --> 02:05:00,040
Let everyone come. - Nonsense.
- The bus is here. Come..
TIMEIN: 02:04:57:32	DURATION: 02:72	TIMEOUT: 02:05:00:04

1818
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:02,200
Okay, dear.
- Sir. Pray for us.

1819
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:04,120
This time you will succeed.

1820
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:05,600
God will help you.

1821
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:06,960
Shall we leave?
- Okay. - Hey.

1822
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,480
Come..
- See you.

1823
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:11,040
What is this?

1824
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:13,400
You are very restless.

1825
02:05:13,640 --> 02:05:15,400
Hey. Are you angry?

1826
02:05:16,440 --> 02:05:17,800
Did you sit already?
- Smile.

1827
02:05:18,440 --> 02:05:19,360
Smile, please.

1828
02:05:20,200 --> 02:05:21,000
Get lost.

1829
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:24,680
Will you take the ticket?

1830
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:57,600
Will it rain?
