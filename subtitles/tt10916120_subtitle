1
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,530
'Chandigarh.'

2
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,330
'Punjab's capital.'

3
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:04,760
'All the boys staying in small towns
and villages of Punjab dream about..'

4
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,590
'..completing high school so
that go to Chandigarh to get a degree..'

5
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,600
'..rent a room there and
have the time of their lives.'

6
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,510
'These boys have come to
Chandigarh with the same dreams.'

7
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,520
'Dimpy Brar and Sharan Dhalilival.'

8
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,950
'There are about to face the
worst high water of their lives.'

9
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,880
'That is, a high tide.'

10
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:34,700
'Now God alones knows how that
high tide is going to affect their lives.'

11
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,960
Mr. Sharma had called me.

12
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,550
He said that you boys
are from decent families.

13
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,090
- Okay. - I agreed because you
would pay the rent on time.

14
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,110
The refrigerator.

15
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,330
Have cold water,
make ice, do whatever you want.

16
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,340
Do you see this wall unit, son?
I got is especially made.

17
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,150
It contains imported crockery.

18
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,760
You can eat,
drink and relax at the dinning table.

19
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,140
These are the beds. You can use them.

20
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,090
These are blankets, you can use..

21
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,810
They are a little dirty.

22
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,340
Get them cleaned.

23
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,220
Not a problem.

24
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,670
- We will have them cleaned.
- Come here, boys.

25
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,900
This is a settee.

26
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,550
You can rest here when you get tired.
I had brought it from Delhi.

27
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,770
Look over there,
a poster of Kareena Kapoor.

28
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,030
Keep looking at it and enjoy yourself.

29
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,330
There's the cupboard. You can use it.

30
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,760
Keep your clothes in it.

31
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,850
Auntie, these bottles?

32
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,630
- Mr. Sharma has a drink or two sometimes.
- Okay.

33
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,960
He must be hiding them in here.

34
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,370
What are you waiting for, stupid?
Throw them out!

35
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,420
Oh, I see.

36
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,980
Uncle plays hockey as well.

37
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,680
No, the boys who used to
stay here were hockey players.

38
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,880
- Okay.
- He was the university topper.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,890
- One of them is still the president.
- Okay.

40
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,820
I said throw them out!

41
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,100
What if Sandhu-bhai (brother) comes back?

42
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,440
Oh yes.

43
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,370
No problem.
You guys adjust a little.

44
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,930
- No problem. We will manage.
- Okay?

45
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,530
- You help them clean up.
- Okay.

46
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,060
Make yourself useful.

47
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,740
I'll go and have tea.

48
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,700
Brother, Sandhu didn't play,
he was used to slay.

49
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,210
Payment in advance, sir.

50
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,030
You guys leave.

51
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,070
And I am left behind with a few shirts.

52
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,590
I end up wearing them.

53
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:21,900
You can have the money.

54
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,580
What's the bungalow number?

55
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,650
22.

56
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,720
Sandhu-bhai's?

57
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,740
- Yes.
- Right.

58
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,110
No need.
You can pay later.

59
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,180
No problem.

60
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,320
You can pay later.
I am not worried about the money.

61
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,060
So, to conclude, from school to college
and from college to the university..

62
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,450
..everything has changed.

63
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,360
Except for this tea, bread and chutney.

64
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,260
They still taste the same.

65
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,790
I totally agree.

66
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,140
Today, we attend all lectures.

67
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,120
From tomorrow,
we go looking for a girlfriend.

68
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,550
The sooner we start the better.

69
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,250
- Stand up.
- What happened?

70
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,110
President's right hand.

71
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,520
President's men are here.

72
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,530
The canteen's empty as well.

73
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,760
Hello, brother.

74
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,680
Stay away from them.

75
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,810
- He looks dangerous.
- He is very dangerous.

76
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,350
Uncle, send tea and stuffed bread.

77
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,940
So, new admission?

78
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,150
Yes.

79
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,990
- Come here.
- Okay.

80
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,410
Stand in a line.
Come on.

81
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,030
Very good.

82
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,300
What's your hostel number?

83
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,930
Not a hostel, brother.
We have rented a room outside.

84
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,890
- Sector?
- 34.

85
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,400
Bungalow number 22.

86
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,940
Which?

87
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,960
Number 22?

88
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,490
You are staying in Sandhu-bhai's bungalow?

89
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,420
Yes.

90
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,870
You don't know where you are staying.

91
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,910
That is a very lucky place.

92
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,320
We used to wait for Sandhu-bhai
to invite us to party there.

93
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,190
Kang.

94
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,380
If you need anything,
any time, contact me.

95
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,530
You'll be given top priority.

96
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,770
You see the attention I get?

97
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,580
It's all thanks to Sandhu.

98
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,760
See you, take care.

99
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,860
Uncle, let them eat on credit.

100
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,680
Welcome to Chandigarh, my friend.

101
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,760
Sharan, this has helped us extremely.

102
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,800
We don't even need to bother
to find out who this Sandhu is or is not.

103
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,220
- We got lucky.
- Very lucky.

104
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,860
But like auntie said, he must be a topper.

105
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,470
That's why everyone respects him so much.

106
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,080
Come on then, cheers to Sandhu.

107
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,640
Long live Sandhu-bhai!

108
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,520
What are you celebrating?

109
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,050
Where's Sandhu?

110
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,350
Sandhu who?

111
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,280
You uncle, dumbos.

112
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,650
S-A-N..

113
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,770
D-O..

114
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,570
Sandhu.

115
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,150
Now tell me, in English.

116
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,020
I swear, I don't know.

117
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,250
You?

118
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,410
My dear big bro, I come today, new tenant.

119
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,610
No clue, I swear.

120
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:45,740
Stupid, I'll shoot from front
and the bullet will come out from?

121
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,240
- Salman Khan has told that to everyone.
- Yes, brother.

122
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,700
Sandhu is my enemy.

123
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:58,090
A look at your faces makes it clear
that forget belonging to his group..

124
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,190
..you don't even belong to his village.

125
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,630
We aren't.

126
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,640
Come here.

127
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,630
Me?

128
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,950
Come on.

129
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:30,720
Memorise this number, both of you.

130
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:38,250
If you ever get any information
about Sandhu, call me.

131
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,520
Otherwise,
Sonu Dhakka will give such a push..

132
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,280
..that life will be no pushover.

133
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,680
Let's go.

134
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,110
Come on.

135
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,450
'Didn't I mention a high tide?'

136
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,660
You want to study!

137
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,100
In Chandigarh!

138
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,820
This is what we had feared.

139
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,810
I had met aunt just as I left the house.

140
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,910
Mom had asked me to dust
my shoes before going ahead.

141
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,180
That was a bad omen.

142
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,670
But I didn't listen to her.

143
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,110
Forget it.
Let's get out of here.

144
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,130
Come on, let's go.

145
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,600
Open the door.

146
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,380
Who is that?

147
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,860
Go and find out.

148
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,030
- You answer the door.
- Is anyone home?

149
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,730
Let's go together.

150
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,640
Let's go.

151
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,870
Open it.

152
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,670
Is anyone there? Come on.

153
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,520
- Yes?
- Here's your parcel, brother.

154
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,810
Here.

155
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,070
What are you staring at?
Sign here quickly.

156
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,330
I need go to other places as well.

157
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,460
Hurry up.

158
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,480
Number. Phone number.
Hurry up.

159
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:45,440
Okay.

160
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,690
They have delayed me.

161
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,410
Strange.

162
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,580
Even the courier guys
of Chandigarh have attitude.

163
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,680
Huh?

164
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,830
- This is for Sandhu.
- Set it on fire.

165
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,270
Well done.

166
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,100
"Set it on fire."

167
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,360
I have signed my name on it.
Dimpy Singh Brar, son of Boota Singh Brar.

168
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,160
After what I have heard of Sandhu,
he'll set my family on fire.

169
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,900
"Set it on fire."

170
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,250
This is a wedding invite.

171
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,770
Simran weds Monty.

172
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,590
There's a letter in it.

173
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,130
A letter?
Read it.

174
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,360
Rajveer, I don't know whether
this letter will ever reach you.

175
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,720
But this letter is my last hope.

176
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,810
After you left I realised that you
were right and my brother was wrong.

177
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,050
He used us to expand his business
and get Monty's wealth.

178
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:33,850
Simran.

179
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,030
Aunt!

180
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,220
We are in trouble.

181
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,790
What is this?

182
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,210
Tell me, what should we do?

183
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,510
You tell me.

184
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,370
Sandhu?

185
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,410
Or Dhakka?

186
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,100
Yes?

187
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,130
We were at the university.

188
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,090
What's this commotion about?

189
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,370
- I don't know.
- Why are the cops here?

190
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,860
- Tell me your name.
- They are here for an enquiry.

191
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,930
They do this every time.

192
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:00,940
Stop, stop, stop.

193
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,000
What happened, bro?

194
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,390
Nothing.

195
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,580
Sonu Dhakka thrashed Kang.

196
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,840
Where can we find him?

197
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,690
Kang's going to stay in
the hospital for a few days.

198
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,110
- Let's go.
- Okay.

199
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,270
Thank God he didn't beat us up.

200
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,360
- Hurry up.
- Tell me what had happened.

201
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,670
Come on, let's go.

202
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,460
Think about it, again.

203
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,740
I suggest we should call Dhakka.

204
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,430
Hold on.. I already have
a lot on my mind.

205
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,170
Hello, brother.

206
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,320
Come.

207
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,660
You have come to find out how I am doing?

208
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,960
No, brother.
There's a wedding invite.

209
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,140
Brother, I apologise,
I won't be able to attend it.

210
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,160
I'll send a few boys over.

211
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,240
- No, brother.
- There was a letter in it as well.

212
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,030
Who gets a letter
to someone who is unwell?

213
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,440
You should get fruits.

214
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,930
Read it, brother.

215
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,100
Here.

216
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,130
Yes.

217
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,810
So, things have gone that bad?

218
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,990
Then this letter needs to be delivered.

219
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,290
What's the date today, uncle?

220
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,190
There is just one day left.

221
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,730
How did you come here?

222
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,930
- On our motorbike.
- Can you drive a jeep?

223
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,050
Yes, brother.

224
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,530
Then help me up.

225
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,630
Hats off to your friendship, brother.

226
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,990
You agreed to come along in this state?

227
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,830
I can even die for Sandhu-bhai.

228
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,280
This is nothing.

229
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,110
Kang-bhai, can I ask something?

230
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,700
- Don't get upset.
- Okay.

231
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,890
We started staying in
that room just two days back..

232
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,750
..and all everyone
is talking about is Sandhu.

233
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,550
Some love him,
some fear him and some are angry with him.

234
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,730
Who is this Sandhu?

235
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,050
What's the story?

236
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,280
Like you need to mention the
shores before you mention a river..

237
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,780
..the same stands
true for Sandhu as well.

238
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,460
Sandhu wasn't alone.

239
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,910
There were two more boys with him.

240
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:04,720
Sharp eyes, sharper mind
and a desire to become a leader.

241
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,630
Garewal.

242
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,870
And the other one was Gill.

243
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,090
The one who used to cause
trouble and take the backseat.

244
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,380
Yesterday's dance show was fun.

245
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,660
Boota enjoyed himself.

246
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,030
- Garewal?
- Yes?

247
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,060
Are these boys from our college?

248
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,740
How does it concern you?

249
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,320
So, what will you have?

250
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,410
- Order something spicy.
- Order anything.

251
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,680
Does it even work or have
you kept it to scare the birds away?

252
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,660
It can even scare parrots like you away.

253
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,750
Do you want something?

254
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,120
Really?

255
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,840
- Yes, I want something.
- What?

256
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,590
5 kilos flour.

257
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:44,750
Do you have it?

258
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,670
Come on, let's weigh the flour for him.

259
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
Damn you.

260
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,140
There starts another fight.

261
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,020
There is a jeep racing
at 100 km/hr on an empty road.

262
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,700
The driver is furious.

263
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,310
So that's Sandhu-bhai!

264
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,440
That's me.

265
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,770
Tell us where Sandhu is.

266
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,420
I'm going to get him.

267
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,730
Sandhu.

268
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,420
His life stood on three pillars.

269
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,190
His parents.

270
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,240
His friends.

271
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,430
And his blanket.

272
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,840
Sandhu-bhai, Gill is getting thrashed.

273
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,260
Let's hurry up.

274
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,580
You..!

275
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,570
Get up.

276
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,350
Come on, get up.

277
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,710
Is that enough flour
or do you want some more?

278
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,390
Hey!

279
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,150
Damn you.

280
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,760
Hey!

281
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,210
There are just two things
that are revered in the university.

282
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,820
Books..

283
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,760
..and Sandhu.

284
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,970
I am fed up of the three of you.

285
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,870
How many times do I
need to tell you that...

286
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,960
...you need to behave yourself
if you want to study in this university.

287
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,490
But you guys just don't
understand anything.

288
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,050
You pick up a fight every day.

289
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,760
Do you think you guys are
some hot-tempered action heroes?

290
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,220
Yes, Bhola?

291
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,120
I'm in just a stupid meeting.
I'll talk to you later.

292
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:02,400
Garewal, don't make me rusticate
all of you because of this.

293
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,030
Okay, sir.

294
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,580
One more thing.

295
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,990
Elections are just around the corner.

296
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,000
I don't want all this in the university.

297
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:13,890
Do you understand?

298
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,280
Yes, sir.

299
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,970
- Get out.
- Thank you.

300
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,750
Garewal,
this is what's called friendship.

301
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,070
You saw how he made
him fly like a gas balloon

302
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,940
You were standing right to
me and you didn't even touch them.

303
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,350
This isn't the first time for you.

304
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,270
You pick up a fight every other day.

305
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,360
Just because you know
Sandhu will handle it.

306
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,290
And Sandhu has no brains.

307
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:39,750
Thank God, he at least has a heart.

308
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,110
We will get into big trouble
if you continue like this.

309
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,430
Why don't you just
say that you are scared?

310
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,840
I am not scared.

311
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,680
When I will take a stand,
I will be rock solid like a mountain.

312
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,230
No one will be able to move me.

313
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,060
Then I too will face death for you.

314
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,310
I won't wait for Sandhu.

315
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,860
Chunja ratted us out.

316
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,400
Sandhu, I know where he hangs out.

317
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,830
Wash it.

318
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,890
Why?

319
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,610
Raman is going around with Romi.

320
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,180
She enjoys snacks with lucky.

321
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:30,770
I feel like telling Romi
and making him fight with Lucky.

322
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:37,000
And then tell Gagan
that Raman loves him.

323
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,500
Brother, I didn't
say anything to the dean.

324
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,120
We didn't ask you that.

325
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,890
Hey!

326
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,380
Don't you have any manners?
Crazy guy.

327
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,360
Who does such things in the university?

328
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,370
You came and slapped this poor fellow.
Are you mad?

329
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,140
What are you staring at?

330
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,870
They come to the university
wearing knickers.

331
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,340
Don't you have any shame?

332
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,160
Just because you have a lot of strength
it doesn't mean that you'll kill him.

333
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,280
Look at his face.

334
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,680
Hey!

335
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,630
Did you understand anything?

336
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,740
Come on, get going now.

337
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,340
And that was Sandhu's Simran.

338
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,960
One look at her and Sandhu's
heart started racing.

339
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,610
We had to take him to a doctor.

340
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,680
Do you understand the story now, doctor?

341
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,620
I have seen such a case for
the first time in my 15 years career.

342
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:00,130
Something is wrong
but nothing seems wrong.

343
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,700
What is wrong?

344
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,600
We too are surprised, doctor.

345
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,160
A person who wouldn't
let anyone speak...

346
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,740
- ...has stopped speaking after
getting scolded by a girl. - Oh, I see.

347
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,790
He bawls out at others.

348
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,270
And a girl bawled out at him.

349
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,380
Oh, I see.

350
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,720
So it was a girl.

351
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,960
You should have said so.

352
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,440
Then I am sure he
can feel the breeze move.

353
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,960
And her hair flying with the wind.

354
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,920
Everything stands still.

355
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,790
And you can see only her.

356
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,320
- Mad! You are!
- Am I right?

357
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,550
Hey!

358
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,200
Yes.

359
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,170
So simple.

360
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,730
I too was wondering what
disease have we not ruled out here.

361
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:44,300
Now whenever that girl comes close
to him and his heart starts racing...

362
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:49,500
...put this pill under his tongue, okay?

363
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,760
- Give me that.
- Please pay the fees before you leave.

364
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,990
Simran, you scold Sandhu
like there's no tomorrow.

365
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,860
I didn't like it.

366
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,050
He's a very nice guy.

367
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,710
I know him since my first year here.

368
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,480
He never even looks at a girl.

369
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,440
You say he doesn't even look at a girl?

370
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,110
He kept staring at me.

371
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,050
Like a crazy man.

372
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,930
Then Sandhu is done for.

373
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:21,140
Seriously, he is a very nice boy.

374
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,150
And the one you scolded him for,
deserves to be thrashed.

375
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:28,190
Chunj, bloody taleteller.

376
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,020
He keeps snitching all day.

377
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,030
If I had been in Sandhu's place then
I would have turned him black and blue.

378
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,530
Really?

379
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,150
Then what I did was wrong.

380
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,370
I shouldn't have said
those things to Sandhu.

381
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,550
Sorry, Dolly.

382
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,410
Don't apologise to me,
go and apologise to Sandhu.

383
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,950
'They come to the university
wearing knickers.'

384
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,450
'Don't you have any shame?'

385
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,840
'Just because you have a lot of strength
it doesn't mean that you'll kill him.'

386
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,700
'Look at his face.'

387
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,780
Hey Sandhu!

388
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,610
Look, my hair is flying with the wind.

389
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,680
Where have you been until now?

390
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,120
Sandhu! Sandhu!

391
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,690
What is wrong with you?

392
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:26,570
Open your mouth wide!

393
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,320
Wider!

394
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,280
Wider!

395
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,510
Yes!

396
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,970
Get up, you lazybones.

397
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,750
Are you alright?

398
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,280
Did you have a reaction from the pill?

399
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,300
Why?

400
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,800
You woke up early in the morning.

401
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,070
And you didn't ask me to make tea.

402
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,980
I have made tea for both of you.

403
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,190
And boiled eggs for you as well.

404
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,900
Quickly get up and go to college.

405
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,410
We came here to study and not sleep.

406
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:30,630
Do you understand?

407
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,600
Wait.

408
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,470
Take the pills along. You never know
when that girl might cross your path.

409
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,340
Get up quickly!

410
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,450
What is wrong with him?

411
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,750
My dearest brother, Chunj Kumar.

412
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,250
Stop snitching around.

413
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,570
You might end up making
someone angry some day.

414
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,810
And when a person gets angry, he...

415
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,250
I am not hitting you.
I am just explaining.

416
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:00,950
Listen to me.

417
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:32,870
Hello.

418
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,180
Sorry, I was too harsh
with you yesterday.

419
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,260
I didn't know that
this boy is a taleteller.

420
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,310
But you too should keep this in mind.

421
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,180
It is not necessary that
every issue is resolved with slaps.

422
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,790
It can be resolved with love as well.

423
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,620
Yes.

424
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,430
I was explaining to him with love.

425
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,140
Now don't embarrass
me by being so respectful.

426
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,090
I heard that you take
very good care of the students.

427
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:05,290
Then take care of me as well.
Take me out for coffee.

428
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,650
What? Coffee?

429
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:07,820
Again?

430
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,680
You won't need this anymore.

431
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:25,870
Dolly told me that you
don't even look at girls.

432
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,180
- Yes.
- Why?

433
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,650
You don't like girls?

434
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,720
I like, but not all of them.

435
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,380
Then how many?

436
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,630
Not many.

437
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,210
Just you.

438
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,250
Actually, I am a very simple guy.

439
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,000
Romance isn't my cup of tea.

440
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,240
I swear, I had to go to a
doctor to find out that I am in love.

441
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,320
My family were about to come down from
the village to enquire about my health.

442
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,490
Sandhu?

443
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,000
Yes?

444
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,140
You are great.

445
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,240
- Yes?
- Yes.

446
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,940
Did you by chance switch
on some fan inside you?

447
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,950
Your hair has starting
flying with the wind.

448
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,980
Hair starts flying
when you fall in love.

449
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:27,370
"Even the best fragrance in my city,"

450
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,620
"Is shy of you."

451
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:34,410
"You will bring back the dead,"

452
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:37,090
"If you pass by graves."

453
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:42,090
"How do I express my feelings?"

454
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:46,430
"I am in awe of Galib."

455
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,300
"How do I express my feelings?"

456
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,590
"I am in awe of Galib."

457
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:05,360
"I want a poetry written for you,
by Galib."

458
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:14,440
"I want a poetry written for you,
by Galib."

459
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,790
"How do I express my feelings?"

460
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:22,030
"I am in awe..."

461
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:34,270
"My love..."

462
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:42,620
"Everyone will talk about your beauty,"

463
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,590
"Beautiful you are from head to toe."

464
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:51,920
"Let me tell you what's
so special about you."

465
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,650
"Everyone will talk about your beauty,"

466
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,830
"Beautiful you are from head to toe."

467
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:05,980
"Let me tell you what's
so special about you."

468
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:11,130
"While I tell you all this,"

469
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:15,340
"I feel shy of Galib."

470
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:25,030
"I want a poetry written for you,
by Galib."

471
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:30,060
"How do I express my feelings?"

472
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,170
"I am in awe..."

473
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,310
"The blind started seeing,"

474
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:40,620
"They started searching for you."

475
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,950
"Seeing you laugh,"

476
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,270
"Even the mute in
my city started talking."

477
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:04,270
"For now,
he only draws lines on blank pages."

478
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:11,420
"Your beloved isn't a poet."

479
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:18,640
"For now,
he only draws lines on blank pages."

480
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,840
"Your beloved isn't a poet."

481
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:34,040
"That's why I try to convey
what's in my heart, through Galib."

482
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:43,750
"I want a poetry written for you,
by Galib."

483
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:52,340
"I want a poetry written for you,
by Galib."

484
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:57,450
"How do I express my feelings?"

485
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:59,900
"I am in awe..."

486
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:11,280
"My love..."

487
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,980
Boys are right.

488
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,890
Baggha is acting arrogant.

489
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,970
He won't talk to anyone properly.

490
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:28,340
We are tolerating him because
you all made him the president.

491
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,400
Right.

492
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,220
Nowadays he shakes hand too
like it takes an effort. Like this.

493
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,340
Sandhu, even the boys from
the game department complained.

494
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,730
They aren't getting proper food.

495
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:38,390
He gets a share at the
cycle stand and the mess.

496
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,570
He makes money from them.

497
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,570
And he follows Monty's
orders these days.

498
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,720
Are you alright, brother?

499
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,750
Everything is fine, Baggha.
But you don't look fine.

500
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,210
Why? What happened?

501
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,160
Who is standing against you
during the elections, this time?

502
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,130
It's just me, I have everyone's consent.

503
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,020
Even Monty is supporting us.

504
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,440
Sit.

505
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,690
Not here.

506
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,990
During the elections.

507
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,380
Why?

508
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:52,180
When your shoes start hurting,
it's time to dust them.

509
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,660
Do you understand?

510
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:55,960
Then who will contest instead?

511
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:11,890
So I go ahead with the slogan?

512
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,380
Go ahead.

513
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,910
Garewal!

514
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,780
Long live our leader!

515
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,160
Garewal!

516
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,200
Long live our leader!

517
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,620
Garewal!

518
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,330
Long live our leader!

519
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:36,990
- Garewal!
- Long live our leader!

520
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:39,010
Long live our leader!

521
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,340
Long live our leader!

522
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,520
Long live our leader!

523
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,210
- Garewal!
- Long live our leader!

524
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,680
Garewal!

525
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:48,750
Long live our leader!

526
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,990
- Garewal!
- Long live our leader!

527
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,430
- Long live our leader!
- Long live our leader!

528
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,720
Mr. Kaala, please don't mind it..

529
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,390
..but I don't understand one thing.

530
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:04,030
Until some time back
you used to support me.

531
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,960
But now.

532
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,350
There's nothing to understand,
Mr. Bansal.

533
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,350
I supported you because
you were doing well.

534
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:16,470
Now I am supporting him,
because he is doing well.

535
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,660
Kaala behaves well with

536
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,450
those who are doing well.

537
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,520
Baggha, are you a Garewal?

538
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,580
No, brother.

539
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:41,650
Yesterday they were shouting slogans of
Garewal instead of the current president.

540
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,280
Brother, Sandhu has made
a candidate stand against me.

541
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,160
He was my supporter last time.

542
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,060
So that means you don't
have everyone's consent this time.

543
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,970
So we will have to
play politics this time.

544
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,150
Right, brother.

545
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:59,540
With Jagga-bhai's blessing and
your support, I am already a winner.

546
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:04,590
Not you, Monty.

547
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,680
"I am waiting on the path on purpose."

548
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,520
"Dhullah..."

549
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,870
What was that other guy's name?

550
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,490
Sandhu.

551
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:24,390
"Sandhu, come and
help me lift the basket."

552
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,380
"I don't follow anyone's path."

553
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,930
"Paths are formed where I tread."

554
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,190
"We know how to pushover."

555
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,650
"Government are formed
with our support."

556
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:00,430
"We scan the ground with our eyes."

557
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:03,020
"We are proud of every vote we get."

558
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,840
"I like to end matters amicably."

559
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,330
"That's why I don't
like to get into fights."

560
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:11,820
"Don't..."

561
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,740
"Don't have any doubts, my dear."

562
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,360
"You don't stand a chance."

563
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,150
"Don't have any doubts, my dear."

564
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:25,510
"You don't stand a chance."

565
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:41,250
"We debate on issues troubling us."

566
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,920
"We always speak
for everyone's benefit."

567
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,780
"Once we give you our word."

568
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,480
"There is no way we
will back out from it."

569
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,130
"If someone still
tries to mess with us."

570
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,890
"Then he disappears from the world map."

571
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:58,170
"Don't..."

572
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,050
"Don't have any doubts, my dear."

573
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:05,670
"You don't stand a chance."

574
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,590
"Don't have any doubts, my dear."

575
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:12,180
"You don't stand a chance."

576
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,530
started spreading their wings, brother.
Pigeons in the university have

577
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:21,280
It's time to clip their wings.

578
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,780
Last one.

579
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,160
Very good.
Well done.

580
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,070
Give me a high-five.

581
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,700
Surinder!

582
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,610
Take my handsome son away.

583
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,740
He is done with dinner.
Let him play the game.

584
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,570
Bye, papa.

585
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,990
- Let's go.
- Bye.

586
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,200
do I need to tell you...
Kaala, how many times

587
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,200
...not to say such things before kids?

588
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,450
It has a bad effect on them.

589
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:55,700
Do you understand?

590
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,160
There's a fire blazing inside me.

591
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:03,200
but the heat doesn't go away.
I eat cold things,

592
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,240
Tell me.

593
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:16,570
issues with the president's post.
Brother, we are facing

594
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,820
Issues...

595
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,740
Elections are going to take place.
Well, it's plain and simple.

596
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,900
hearts of the students will win.
Only the one who rules the

597
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,530
So, you will have to be courageous.

598
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,660
the college president on my own.
Back in the days I became

599
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,030
to become the president.
And now I want Monty

600
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,900
I support him.

601
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,820
Not upfront.

602
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,900
But with full back support.

603
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,450
Fix a meeting.

604
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:05,950
and others tease me.
Simran, you know Gill

605
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,240
They say Simran has made me speechless.

606
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,660
Everyone calls you Sandhu?

607
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,660
No, my family calls me Rajveer.

608
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,660
Then I too will call you Rajveer.

609
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:19,280
You are Sandhu for outsiders.

610
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,950
You are Rajveer for your family.

611
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,070
Oh, I see.

612
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,280
So you are family?

613
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,570
Do you have doubts?
Yes, of course.

614
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:30,490
But I am a villager.
I have no doubts.

615
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,240
From a Jatt family.

616
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,570
for 30 workers to the field every day.
We are farmers. We send food

617
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,990
You are a girl from the city.

618
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,070
Rajveer, you know I love villages.

619
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,950
I don't like this fast-paced city life.

620
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,570
I'll get your lunch.
You work in the fields,

621
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,450
Such a peaceful life.

622
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,360
You should talk to your parents.

623
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,110
I don't need to.

624
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,700
if she agrees otherwise kidnap her.
My father would say it's okay

625
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,860
come and meet my family.
No, I want you to

626
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:03,030
I will, but at the right time.
Of course,

627
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,160
Give it here.

628
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,400
Pass it to me.

629
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:16,400
What are you doing?

630
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:17,530
Basket it.

631
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:18,740
Give it to me.

632
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,320
Come on, throw it to me.

633
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,070
- Over here.
- Come on, man.

634
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:49,280
to make Monty the president.
We want you all to consent

635
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,400
president wants as well.
This is what the current

636
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,660
You all too should accept it.

637
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:03,450
then Kaala is here for you.
If anyone needs anything

638
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,820
That is okay.

639
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,110
But brother needs to consent as well.

640
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,450
Which brother?

641
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,320
Are we expecting anyone else as well?

642
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,450
If there is then call them as well.

643
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,450
how much ever you want and sit out.
Garewal, take whatever,

644
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:10,490
more sense than money.
You and Baggha need

645
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:12,700
There is no GST on that.

646
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:15,240
And forget that I am going to sit out.

647
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:18,950
Listen, I know how to make people sit.

648
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:24,900
We sit and get up as we will.

649
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:30,160
There is no one who can make us sit..

650
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:34,490
..or get up unwillingly.

651
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,450
Sandhu, I think...

652
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:45,280
A bad society gives rise to thieves.

653
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,610
And universities give rise to goons.

654
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,070
So vote peacefully.

655
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,530
to prepare so well...
I want both the candidates

656
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:59,530
defeat is assured.
...that the opposition

657
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,450
So don't fight and prepare yourself.

658
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:10,160
We are well prepared in whatever we do.

659
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,860
A word, boy?

660
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,570
What is wrong?

661
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:43,110
Monty is not good to be a president?

662
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:48,110
doesn't make a coward brave.
Putting up a brave facade

663
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:52,110
Anger is a dangerous weapon.

664
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,780
Stay clear of it as much as you can.

665
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:05,610
looks like just another pond.
A sea without a storm

666
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:11,280
weren't in the university when I was.
You should thank your stars, you

667
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:20,530
that Sandhu wasn't there back then.
You should thank your stars

668
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:25,570
- Excuse me.
- The thing is...

669
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:30,240
Yes, Bhola?

670
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:34,360
I am just attending a stupid meeting.
No.

671
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:36,780
I'll talk to you later.

672
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,200
So, what were you saying?

673
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:45,450
Nothing.

674
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:52,360
Catch.

675
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:11,950
Bhola and why don't we know him?
First tell me who is this

676
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,280
There is no Bhola.

677
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:21,200
he is not as great as he thinks he is.
It is just a way to show somehow that

678
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,530
- Hi!
- Hi!

679
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:27,030
- Hello.
- Hello, Simran. How are you?

680
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,740
- Hello, brother.
- Hello, dear.

681
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:31,860
- Good.
- How's college?

682
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:35,530
a beehive here, Sandhu.
I think you have disturbed

683
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,240
- Okay, brother.
- Be home on time.

684
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,200
See you at home, in the evening.

685
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:39,950
- Bye.
- Bye.

686
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:45,240
extract honey out of the beehive.
I am not Sandhu I don't

687
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:53,110
that you are Jagga's sister...
From the time I learnt

688
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,700
started feeling scared.
...I swear I have

689
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,240
Saw how great my brothers are?

690
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,070
That's what I fear.

691
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,990
in the past six months.
I have had 24 issues

692
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,610
is like playing with fire.
Messing with my brothers

693
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:11,990
Dealing with your brother is no biggie.

694
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:13,070
Oh really?

695
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:14,860
Then what will do for their sister?

696
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:17,740
I'll set up a home for her on the moon.

697
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:22,740
talk to them and fight them.
For that, you should

698
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,490
Whatever you say, my dear.

699
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,400
to study and not to fight.
Friends, we come here

700
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:31,820
to be played and enjoyed.
A game is supposed

701
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:37,070
is on winning rather than the game.
Once it becomes a competition, our focus

702
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,160
let anyone else cheat.
So don't cheat and don't

703
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,070
Long live Garewal!

704
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,160
Long live Garewal!

705
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,740
Long live Garewal!

706
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:49,700
Long live Garewal!

707
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,530
"Everyone starts talking about us."

708
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:57,900
"We make headlines."

709
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,820
"Enemies see red when they see us."

710
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,610
fuses and get furious."
"They all lose their

711
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:09,070
with the one Sandhu supports."
"No one dares to mess

712
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,280
"Don't..."

713
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,160
"Don't have any doubts, my dear."

714
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,900
"You don't stand a chance."

715
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:22,740
"Don't have any doubts, my dear."

716
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,450
"You don't stand a chance."

717
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:44,490
who can challenge us."
"We are yet to come across

718
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:49,610
we crush their bones."
"If someone attacks,

719
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:52,700
"We can tame the wildest ones."

720
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,490
"We don't trouble the ordinary ones."

721
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:59,030
"Don't..."

722
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,700
"Don't have any doubts, my dear."

723
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:06,200
"You don't stand a chance."

724
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,070
"Don't have any doubts, my dear."

725
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,160
"You don't stand a chance."

726
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:36,610
Long live Garewal!

727
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,950
Long live Garewal!

728
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:41,610
Long live Garewal!

729
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:43,200
Long live Monty-bhai!

730
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,240
Long live Monty-bhai!

731
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,780
- Silence!
- Long live Monty-bhai!

732
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,320
Be quiet!

733
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,450
Be quiet.
Be quiet, students.

734
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,360
of the university.
Don't spoil the atmosphere

735
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:58,660
You are students so behave like one.

736
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,660
of the university..
If you spoil the atmosphere

737
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:02,990
..then I shall cancel the elections.

738
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:04,820
Do you understand?

739
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:06,860
Go away.

740
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:09,570
Move your jeeps back.

741
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,860
I feel like informing Manju's family.

742
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,320
twice and refused both times.
I asked for her number

743
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,530
What happened?

744
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:23,530
Look.

745
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:27,490
that I would fall in love.
Simran, I had never thought

746
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:31,700
and my life would change.
That I would meet you

747
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,740
hue of love after I saw you.
I too got covered in the

748
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,950
I will never let it fade.

749
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:38,570
No matter what I need to do.

750
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,360
What does one need to do in love anyway?

751
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:43,240
Go out for coffee a couple of times.
Say sweets things.

752
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,490
That's it and you are done.

753
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,660
to feed you own flesh these days.
It's not like you have

754
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,320
Or swim using an unbaked pot.

755
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,820
Don't worry.
Or burn in desert heat.

756
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:55,320
I am ready to swim and to burn as well.
If you stand by my side,

757
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,530
That's dessert right there.

758
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,030
Why do we need to go anywhere else?

759
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,740
Did you forget the slap?
Really?

760
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:11,450
you get while snitching.
You don't know the high

761
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,030
It is better than even heroin.

762
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,490
brought them together.
It was that slap that

763
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,160
Today, that slap shall separate them.

764
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,990
Get the camera out and click a photo.

765
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:24,160
Not ours, their.

766
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:31,280
Brother, I didn't click the photo.

767
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,070
Another boy had sent it to me.

768
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:59,900
university is now heading to my home.
The fire that was restricted to the

769
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,990
I won't let it cross my threshold.

770
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,070
So when the fire will be forced back...

771
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:14,030
to bear the heat of the blaze.
...your bones won't be able

772
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23,320
The hand that desires gold rings..

773
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:27,610
..won't even get a brass bangle.

774
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:31,990
You are smart.

775
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:34,240
Do you understand?

776
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,570
Yes.

777
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:38,860
Go on.

778
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:04,610
I might be Gill's sister...
Brother Sandhu,

779
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,780
more than I respect him.
...but I respect you

780
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:09,660
all my brothers together.
I want to talk to

781
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,360
Where is Garewal?

782
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,450
Gurudwara to seek blessings.
He has gone to the

783
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:15,070
to you when he comes back.
I'll ask him to talk

784
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:18,200
Look, Garewal is also here.
We two are here.

785
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:18,950
Start talking now.

786
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,320
Hello, brother.

787
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,280
How are you, sister?

788
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,530
You should start making preparations.

789
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:25,780
And get some smart formals stitched.

790
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:29,070
when they see my brothers.
Everyone should be awesome

791
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,400
Your sister is getting married.
Come soon, boys.

792
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:33,660
that needs to be done.
There is a lot of work

793
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:35,570
We will be there on time.
Don't worry, mother.

794
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,400
- Bye, brother.
- Bye sister, I am hanging up now.

795
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:38,660
- Listen to me, Sandhu.
- I'm leaving.

796
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,570
Simran is waiting for me.
In the evening.

797
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,900
I barely have started studying.

798
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:43,360
- In the evening.
- Sandhu?

799
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:49,450
What happened?

800
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,530
Jagga and Kaala approached me.

801
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:53,610
They threatened me.

802
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,110
Simran?

803
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,160
I cannot take it anymore.

804
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,570
spend time without you.
It is difficult to

805
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:09,860
and whisk you away.
I'll talk to my mother

806
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,490
Keep quiet.
Shh, this is a library.

807
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,610
So what if this is a library?

808
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,360
One cannot express his feelings here?

809
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:18,660
I am talking to my future wife.

810
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:19,900
Have you lost your mind?

811
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,160
What if someone hears you?
Stop saying wife.

812
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,570
Like I am scared of anyone.
So what if anyone hears me?

813
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:24,780
Let me tell everyone.

814
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,320
- Yes, brother?
- Hello.

815
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,030
Can everybody hear me?

816
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:37,530
and she is my future wife, Mrs. Sandhu.
I, Rajveer Sandhu,

817
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,160
Does anyone have any objections?

818
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:43,660
Over there?

819
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:47,360
- No brother, what objection can I have?
- Chunj, you?

820
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,360
You get scared for no reason.
See, no one has any objections.

821
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,030
How many times have I told you not to.

822
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:55,360
that are revered in the university.
There are just two things

823
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:58,200
Books... and Sandhu.

824
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:06,820
the one to object, not us.
Her brothers will be

825
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:18,160
her brothers will object.
Brother, I told them,

826
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,660
Why won't they object?

827
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,280
what Kaala and you are slapping me.
He said who Kaala,

828
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:29,990
going around with your sister.
Slap him instead, who is openly

829
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,280
The opposition has gone mum this time.

830
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,320
Garewal's name is resounding everywhere.

831
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,490
Don't make one for me.

832
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:45,780
Simran objects. I am trying to cut down.

833
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,990
are getting too serious about this girl?
Sandhu, don't you think you

834
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:50,240
Yes, I am, Mr. Garewal.

835
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:52,280
She too is just as serious about me.

836
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,320
Are they too serious?
And her family?

837
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:57,450
They should be serious.
I am a handsome young boy.

838
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,660
If they aren't then I'll make them.

839
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:04,490
non-serious thing after the elections?
Sandhu, can't we have this serious and

840
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,660
important to you than your friend?
Now the elections are more

841
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,610
to you than your friend?
Now the girl is more important

842
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,660
made me contest in election.
You are the one who

843
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,860
- It is not wrong.
- Did I do the wrong thing?

844
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:18,660
We cannot back out now.
But stick to your stand.

845
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:24,990
Now you choose, the girl or your friend.

846
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:29,160
comes the girl. I want both.
My friend comes first then

847
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:31,030
Why don't you understand, Sandhu?

848
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:33,400
to mess with her brothers.
We aren't capable enough

849
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:34,820
They are different kind of people.

850
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,860
I too am different, Garewal.

851
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:38,570
Perhaps you don't know.

852
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:43,030
run with their tails between their legs.
The day I start fight, everyone will

853
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:44,240
Hear me out.

854
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,320
I am leaving.
No arguments in friendship.

855
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:00,200
Did I say something wrong?
Saw that?

856
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:03,360
You met him at the university.
Garewal, you don't know him.

857
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:04,700
I have been with him since childhood.

858
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:08,820
you bend as the wind blows.
You are like a willow tree,

859
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,820
He isn't.

860
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:12,320
He usually doesn't bend.

861
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:16,030
then no one can make him erect.
If he does,

862
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:17,820
I am not stopping him.

863
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,700
This isn't the right time.

864
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:21,780
I know he does a lot for me.

865
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,110
Fine.

866
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,400
You sit here.

867
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:32,160
I'll go and get him.

868
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:35,530
on your way back.
Listen, get more alcohol

869
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:37,240
Fine, I'll get it.

870
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:29,900
Where's your friend?

871
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,360
I have two friends.

872
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:35,900
Which one do you want?

873
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,070
Sandhu.

874
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,070
What do you want to do with Sandhu?

875
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:43,900
Talk to me instead.

876
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:46,450
What do you want anyway?
Tell me.

877
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:48,490
How can I not want anything?

878
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:50,030
Of course, I do

879
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:50,990
Oh really?

880
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:53,740
Tell me what do you want then.

881
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:00,400
5 kilos of flour.

882
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:01,400
Do you have it?

883
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:14,280
Don't joke with Kaala, brother.

884
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:17,990
Someone tried to, once.

885
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:23,860
I moved back a little.

886
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:26,990
Got myself into the position...

887
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,530
Took the pose...

888
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,320
And boom!

889
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:45,900
His black blood started pouring out.

890
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:47,780
Everyone says that blood is black.

891
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,070
I say...

892
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:53,200
I am Kaala.

893
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:58,660
Pearl millet flour or cornmeal?
Now tell me, which flour do you want?

894
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,860
Hey!

895
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,660
Looks like you are out of cash, buddy.

896
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:32,610
Tell that smartypants..

897
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:37,860
..to leave this city before dawn.

898
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:41,110
I'll make him leave the world.
Otherwise,

899
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,840
After our parents passed away..

900
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:27,800
..I was the one who raised you and Kaala.

901
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:35,050
anyone even looking at you.
That's why I cannot tolerate

902
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:39,670
I don't know what's going on in his mind.
And that boy,

903
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:43,800
He is going against Monty in the election.

904
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,550
And he is getting closer to you as well.

905
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:48,920
That's normal.

906
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:53,170
that's something I..
But him ganging up on Kaala,

907
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,800
Brother, Rajveer isn't like that.

908
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,170
He is a very nice boy.

909
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:58,380
Trust me.

910
01:02:58,590 --> 01:02:59,840
You are mistaken about him.

911
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:01,630
Mistaken?

912
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,670
He is always so hot-tempered.

913
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:08,340
thrashing someone every day.
He is beating up or

914
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,800
Kaala barely managed to escape.

915
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,130
Right, brother.

916
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:14,920
I had gone to talk to him.

917
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:17,590
We have raised her with love.
To tell him, Simran is our sister.

918
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:20,050
But he came after me with a sword.

919
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:22,920
He would have killed me.

920
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:28,920
Both of you are like my own child.

921
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,090
So, I am bound to feel worried.

922
01:03:59,000 --> 01:03:59,800
Yes, mother?

923
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,550
Son, where is your friend?

924
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:05,050
I have been calling him since evening.

925
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:06,800
He isn't answering my calls.

926
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,170
He's here. He is coming. What is it?

927
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,340
It's nothing, son.

928
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:14,710
I am just feeling restless since evening.

929
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:16,760
I thought I should call him.

930
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,130
Is everything alright?

931
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:19,590
Yes mother, we are fine.

932
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:20,710
Don't worry.

933
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:24,920
You know he doesn't have a father.

934
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:28,130
to get your sister married.
All of you together have

935
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:30,090
Be there on time, son.

936
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:31,800
Don't worry, mother.

937
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,590
We will be there on time.

938
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,300
Where is Sandhu?

939
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:38,170
Mother, he too has gone out.

940
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:39,960
Don't worry.

941
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:41,170
Okay, son.

942
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,460
Ask him to call me when he returns.

943
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:46,920
I'll ask him to call you when he returns.
Okay mother,

944
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,670
Garewal, is Gill back from the village?

945
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,420
Ask him to make tea.
He just came back.

946
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,670
I should have said in the village.

947
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,760
time along with Pinnis.
Mother gives tea on

948
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:05,920
Cornmeal bread and milk with extra cream.

949
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:07,630
She takes good care of me over there.

950
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:09,760
So what if she is your mother?

951
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,420
She loves us more than she loves you.

952
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,000
she treats us better than she treats you.
When we go to your village,

953
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:16,590
- Right.
- Right, Garewal?

954
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:19,760
you are in Chandigarh because of me.
And my dear,

955
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,170
Like mother says:

956
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:24,920
long as my son Sandhu is there."
"I don't need to worry as

957
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:28,000
now go get the Pinnis as well.
Come on my boy,

958
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:29,460
They are over.

959
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:37,960
Yes, Kang?

960
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:39,210
How's Gill doing?

961
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,300
What do I say over the phone?

962
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:42,590
Come over to the hospital.

963
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:04,170
Long live Monty-bhai!

964
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,210
Long live Monty-bhai!

965
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:08,210
Long live Monty-bhai!

966
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,170
Long live Monty-bhai!

967
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,210
Long live Monty-bhai!

968
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:55,590
Are you alright?

969
01:06:56,630 --> 01:06:58,260
Don't worry, I won't die so soon.

970
01:06:58,380 --> 01:06:59,420
Who was it?

971
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,590
I asked, who was it?

972
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:19,880
Kaala.

973
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:22,460
Listen to me, Sandhu.

974
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:23,880
Listen to me, Sandhu.

975
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,840
This isn't the right time.
- Let go of my hand. - Don't be stupid.

976
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,800
- Listen to me.
- Let go of my hand, Garewal.

977
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:28,840
Let go!

978
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,380
The matter will get out of hand, Sandhu.

979
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:34,260
It already has, Garewal.

980
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:36,260
Sandhu!

981
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:38,710
"We don't need to talk much."

982
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:44,500
"A stare is enough to explain."

983
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:48,710
"He doesn't dare to look up again.."

984
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:52,840
"The one we put to his place."

985
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,300
Long live Monty-bhai!

986
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:59,340
with courage can use it."
"But only the one

987
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:02,340
Long live Monty-bhai!

988
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:05,670
"There are only a few rare gems.."

989
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:08,670
"Who can rule the world."

990
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,340
Long live Monty-bhai!

991
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:16,880
are missed after they are gone."
"There aren't many that

992
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:21,710
"There used to be a Sandhu.."

993
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,550
"People shall always remember that."

994
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:27,550
"There used to be a Sandhu.."

995
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:31,050
"People shall always remember that."

996
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:43,960
All those who are here for entertainment..

997
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,300
..move to the sides.

998
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:55,710
"People will talk.."

999
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,460
"He was feared."

1000
01:08:58,590 --> 01:09:04,550
he would stand his ground."
"He was brave and fearless,

1001
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:09,380
"People will talk.."

1002
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:12,130
"He was feared."

1003
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:18,130
he would stand his ground."
"He was brave and fearless,

1004
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:24,590
he won't be forgotten for centuries.
"Not years,

1005
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,880
"There used to be a Sandhu.."

1006
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,670
"People shall always remember that."

1007
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:36,090
"There used to be a Sandhu.."

1008
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:39,460
"People shall always remember that."

1009
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,130
I had used this to break his legs as well.

1010
01:11:23,210 --> 01:11:28,550
like fire loves dry wood.
Sandhu loves his enemies

1011
01:12:55,670 --> 01:12:59,380
- Look, he ran away.
- He ran away.

1012
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:13,130
Simran..

1013
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:14,000
Simran..

1014
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:15,130
Simran, listen to me.

1015
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:18,210
Tell Sandhu not to talk to me again.

1016
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:35,670
What was the need to do this?

1017
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:38,090
I couldn't drink water since last night..

1018
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,300
was the need to do this?
..and you ask me what

1019
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:45,300
me know if I haven't broken enough bones.
Ask the doctor to check and let

1020
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,550
Move back! Move back! Move back!

1021
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:02,920
Sir is coming. Move back! Move back!

1022
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:09,550
Are they our boys?

1023
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:14,380
No brother, they are Sandhu's.

1024
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,000
Wait here, I'll be right back.

1025
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:26,420
Move back, quickly!

1026
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:28,300
Move aside, give way.

1027
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:53,710
It's okay.

1028
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:59,760
- Okay.
- Shift him into a private room.

1029
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:33,920
a part of the history of a university.
Education and fights both are

1030
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:36,090
So, this is going to continue.

1031
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,840
But this fight didn't take place..

1032
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:43,840
..because of the post of president.

1033
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:47,420
It happened because of our sister.

1034
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:52,050
Tell Sandhu..

1035
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:55,300
..not to enter the university again.

1036
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:57,210
Okay.

1037
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:01,710
explain anything else to you.
I think I don't need to

1038
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:06,920
Don't let stray grains ruin your meal.

1039
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,500
I hope you understand.

1040
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:13,550
Yes.

1041
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:24,710
Come here.

1042
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,920
he was thrashing Kaala?
Where were you when

1043
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:33,260
I was there, brother.

1044
01:16:37,630 --> 01:16:39,090
"He was there."

1045
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:43,590
Hey you. come on, move aside.
Come on, move aside.

1046
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,170
Move aside, everyone.

1047
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:36,090
Are you feeling better?

1048
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:37,630
I have prescribed you some medicines.

1049
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,000
- It's bland.
- Yes. - You will feel better.

1050
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:39,880
I'll check up on him in the evening.

1051
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,590
- You will get better with it.
- Okay.

1052
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:44,630
Are you feeling better?

1053
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:49,340
Doctor, can we take him home?

1054
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:50,710
His sister is getting married.

1055
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:52,590
Why don't you ask him?

1056
01:17:53,130 --> 01:17:55,000
his wounds were still raw.
He didn't ask when

1057
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:57,760
You can take him.

1058
01:17:58,880 --> 01:17:59,710
Let's go.

1059
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:03,210
It's okay. I hit by mistake.

1060
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:04,260
Come on, get up.

1061
01:18:06,130 --> 01:18:07,550
At least help me get down.

1062
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:20,550
Careful. Don't end up hurting yourself.

1063
01:18:22,210 --> 01:18:23,380
- Mother!
- Oh my God!

1064
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,380
My son!

1065
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:26,340
Nothing happened.

1066
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,340
perform a stunt on his motorbike.
He fell while trying to

1067
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:31,050
He forced the doctor to plaster his leg..

1068
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:32,800
to do any work at the wedding.
..so that he doesn't have

1069
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:33,800
- Right.
- Right, Garewal?

1070
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,670
- Don't worry, sister.
- No, mother.

1071
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:36,840
He is a freeloader anyway.

1072
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,380
We are here to work.

1073
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:39,590
It is not so.

1074
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:40,960
I will work as well as dance..

1075
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:42,460
- Enough.
- Brother.

1076
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:44,090
Be careful.

1077
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:45,300
Hello.

1078
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:49,630
Come, son.

1079
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:50,960
Hello, father.

1080
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:52,460
When did you come?

1081
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,840
gave him a good massage.
Looks like some strangers

1082
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,670
No, he just..

1083
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:02,800
when you want to fight.
You should take me along

1084
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:05,550
I don't get to hit people.
My hands get itchy if

1085
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:07,380
Let me go and have some tea, father.

1086
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:09,760
Otherwise, you won't stop.

1087
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,920
I am still strong. - Come on.
- Come on, take me along,

1088
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:15,000
- Let it be, father.
- I am a young man, just like you.

1089
01:19:20,610 --> 01:19:24,760
"My arms don't look good empty.."

1090
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:30,460
"Now that I have just
applied henna on my palms."

1091
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,900
"My arms don't look good empty.."

1092
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:40,020
"Now that I have just
applied henna on my palms."

1093
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:45,220
"Whenever I ask you for something,
you say later."

1094
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:50,620
"Accept glass bangles for now,
I'll get you gold ones later."

1095
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:55,840
"Accept glass bangles for now,
I'll get you gold ones later."

1096
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:56,920
"Hey beautiful.."

1097
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,850
"I'll get you gold bangles later."

1098
01:19:58,970 --> 01:19:59,740
"My love.."

1099
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:01,960
"I'll get you gold bangles later."

1100
01:20:03,190 --> 01:20:07,000
"There is no rain without clouds."

1101
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:13,000
"A gem doesn't need jewellery."

1102
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:17,790
"There is no rain without clouds."

1103
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:21,260
"A gem doesn't need jewellery."

1104
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:28,280
"Your attitude will even
give a jeweller a tough fight."

1105
01:20:28,730 --> 01:20:31,230
"You cannot even get glass bangles.."

1106
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:34,070
"Others are ready
to lay down their lives."

1107
01:20:34,190 --> 01:20:36,920
"You cannot even get glass bangles.."

1108
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,150
"Others are ready
to lay down their lives."

1109
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:39,930
"Hey handsome.."

1110
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:41,920
"Others are ready
to lay down their lives."

1111
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:42,670
"My beloved.."

1112
01:20:42,790 --> 01:20:45,110
"Others are ready
to lay down their lives."

1113
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:06,310
"Whenever I asked
you for a new dress.."

1114
01:21:06,430 --> 01:21:09,050
"You came up with
a new excuse instead."

1115
01:21:09,170 --> 01:21:11,900
"What's the use of
you being a big shot.."

1116
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:17,200
"When I am not showered
with gifts of all sorts."

1117
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,430
"You try to persuade me by saying.."

1118
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:22,400
"..you'll get me loads
of jewellery later."

1119
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:27,710
"Accept glass bangles for now,
I'll get you gold ones later."

1120
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:32,980
"Accept glass bangles for now,
I'll get you gold ones later."

1121
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:33,750
"Hey beautiful.."

1122
01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:35,920
"I'll get you gold bangles later."

1123
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:36,890
"My love.."

1124
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:39,490
"I'll get you gold bangles later."

1125
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:43,460
"I have noted down all
your desires in my heart."

1126
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:46,290
"One day I am going
to fulfil them all."

1127
01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:49,170
"Let me settle down in my business.."

1128
01:21:49,290 --> 01:21:54,030
"I shall set up a market
right in our fields."

1129
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:59,760
"Moneylenders don't let me live,
it is tough to survive."

1130
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:02,650
"You cannot even get glass bangles.."

1131
01:22:02,770 --> 01:22:04,870
"Others are ready
to lay down their lives."

1132
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:08,350
"You cannot even get glass bangles.."

1133
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:10,290
"Others are ready
to lay down their lives."

1134
01:22:10,410 --> 01:22:11,200
"Hey handsome.."

1135
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,170
"Others are ready
to lay down their lives."

1136
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:14,070
"My beloved.."

1137
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:16,590
"Others are ready
to lay down their lives."

1138
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:32,620
The problem is that Jagga-bhai
said something bad in the hospital.

1139
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:35,860
You didn't tell me about it.

1140
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:39,120
You need to wait for the
right time to say the right thing.

1141
01:22:41,730 --> 01:22:42,980
What did your Jagga-bhai say?

1142
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,360
He asked me to talk
some sense into Sandhu.

1143
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,460
Like Sandhu has been
stealing his fodder.

1144
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:50,450
No, he doesn't steal his fodder.
He meets his sister stealthily.

1145
01:22:50,910 --> 01:22:53,120
Not stealthily,
I meet her in front of everyone.

1146
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:55,790
And Gill endured the
consequences of that.

1147
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:58,060
You are wrong here, Garewal.

1148
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:01,140
I would've stuck to my grounds
even if they were after you.

1149
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:04,360
Has your Jagga-bhai..

1150
01:23:05,610 --> 01:23:07,660
..promised to support
you during the elections?

1151
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:09,980
Sandhu!
Jagga-bhai is right.

1152
01:23:10,290 --> 01:23:11,290
She is his sister.

1153
01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:12,460
She loves me.

1154
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:13,740
I am not forcing his sister.

1155
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:15,770
She doesn't love you.

1156
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:18,160
Jagga-bhai told me that.

1157
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:19,720
The day you had thrashed Kaala..

1158
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:22,260
..Simran called me and
told me the same thing.

1159
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:24,240
Why would I stop you, my friend?

1160
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:26,940
Tell me what you want.

1161
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:30,190
Jagga-bhai says that the
matter will escalate if Sandhu..

1162
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:32,470
..enters the university again.

1163
01:23:38,870 --> 01:23:40,350
And I too don't want..

1164
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:43,790
..you to enter the university
till the elections take place.

1165
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:49,580
Jagga cannot stop Sandhu.

1166
01:23:50,210 --> 01:23:51,250
But if you say..

1167
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:54,240
..forget the university
I won't even enter Chandigarh.

1168
01:23:57,570 --> 01:23:59,750
But I'll have to meet
Simran once before that.

1169
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:09,830
- Did you like the dress?
- Absolutely.

1170
01:24:09,950 --> 01:24:11,160
Yes, absolutely.

1171
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:15,470
I want to talk to you.

1172
01:24:16,370 --> 01:24:17,430
I don't want to talk to you.

1173
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:21,670
If you are upset because
I thrashed Kaala..

1174
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:24,320
..then let me tell you that
Kaala had first thrashed Gill.

1175
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:25,260
That too without any reason.

1176
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:27,970
You don't need to say anything.
I know everything about you.

1177
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,380
What such do you know about me that
you aren't even ready to talk to me?

1178
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,120
Let go of my hand, Sandhu.

1179
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:38,140
Let go of my hand, Sandhu.

1180
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:40,500
You have lost this right.

1181
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:42,980
Since when did you start
addressing me as Sandhu?

1182
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:45,860
You need to think about that.

1183
01:24:50,970 --> 01:24:52,620
Tell us what happened next, brother.

1184
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:54,190
What else could have happened next?

1185
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:58,090
Simran said no to Sandhu and
Sandhu said no to the university.

1186
01:24:58,740 --> 01:25:00,590
Gill obviously supported him.

1187
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:03,640
And Garewal become the
president of the university.

1188
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:09,290
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1189
01:25:09,410 --> 01:25:12,340
Hit the brakes. Stop right here.

1190
01:25:13,730 --> 01:25:15,520
What happened, brother?
Are you alright?

1191
01:25:15,790 --> 01:25:18,030
My blabber will burst.
There's a lot of pressure.

1192
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:19,500
Help me pee.

1193
01:25:28,950 --> 01:25:31,020
I am done.
Pull up the zip.

1194
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:40,670
Now I feel as light as a flower.

1195
01:25:40,790 --> 01:25:42,460
Are you comfortable now?

1196
01:25:43,130 --> 01:25:43,980
Yes.

1197
01:25:49,190 --> 01:25:51,620
Stop or do you want
to enter their kitchen?

1198
01:25:59,010 --> 01:26:02,220
Brother, his father
looks hot-tempered as well.

1199
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:04,520
You are right.

1200
01:26:04,770 --> 01:26:06,160
He's more hot-tempered than Sandhu.

1201
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:07,400
Come on, now get me down.

1202
01:26:07,570 --> 01:26:08,370
Who are they, Ramu?

1203
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:10,190
A few boys.

1204
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:12,170
- Help me get my feet down.
- There you go.

1205
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:18,730
That looks like Kang. Who is with him.

1206
01:26:21,530 --> 01:26:22,430
God bless you.

1207
01:26:22,740 --> 01:26:23,590
- I seek your blessings.
- God bless you.

1208
01:26:23,710 --> 01:26:24,840
I seek your blessings, father.

1209
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,310
That's enough.
It's okay.

1210
01:26:27,670 --> 01:26:28,960
What have you done to yourself?

1211
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:32,440
It's nothing.
I fell from the motorbike last night.

1212
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:35,080
I know the motorbike
you fell from, son.

1213
01:26:37,690 --> 01:26:40,950
- Father, Sandhu-bhai..
- Get water for them.

1214
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:42,310
- All ask them to make tea.
- Okay.

1215
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:45,680
Father, Sandhu-bhai
has gone out for work?

1216
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:49,120
He went to Canada.

1217
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:51,330
Huh?

1218
01:26:52,050 --> 01:26:52,640
He's gone.

1219
01:26:53,330 --> 01:26:54,860
How can he just leave for Canada.

1220
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:57,420
He just returned after
attending Gill's wedding.

1221
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:59,650
Moreover,
it takes four hours to reach Delhi.

1222
01:26:59,770 --> 01:27:00,940
It's only been two hours.

1223
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:02,420
He must have not
even reached Ambala yet.

1224
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,990
Like you have worked for
the Indo-Canadian bus service.

1225
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:07,390
You know everything.

1226
01:27:08,050 --> 01:27:09,440
Run for your lives, guys!

1227
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:11,950
- He'll thrash us if he gets hold of us.
- Hurry up.

1228
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:13,750
- Don't you dare go after him!
- Let's go.

1229
01:27:13,870 --> 01:27:15,950
- Be careful. - He has barely
taken up a job. Let him work.

1230
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:17,730
- Drive! Drive! Drive!
- You scoundrels.

1231
01:27:17,850 --> 01:27:20,080
- I am his father! - Get the car out of
here. I am stronger then him.

1232
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:22,430
If you need him for
a fight then take me along.

1233
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:25,170
For God's sake leave him alone.

1234
01:27:25,290 --> 01:27:26,890
Right. They left.

1235
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,110
We barely escaped today, brother.

1236
01:27:32,230 --> 01:27:33,940
I thought that he is hot-tempered.

1237
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:35,990
Yes, we barely escaped.

1238
01:27:36,110 --> 01:27:38,610
I would've a rod on my foot
as well if he had gotten hold of us.

1239
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:40,790
Forget that.
Tell us what happened next.

1240
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:43,790
Simran was getting engaged,
Sandhu got the lead..

1241
01:27:43,870 --> 01:27:45,220
Won't you ask me where we are going?

1242
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:47,630
Have I ever asked?

1243
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,910
Wherever we are going,
we are going to cause trouble.

1244
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:38,280
Stop the car.

1245
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:46,470
Move back.

1246
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:03,010
No.

1247
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:33,590
This is what was left to be done?

1248
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:35,380
You coming here to create a scene.

1249
01:29:36,810 --> 01:29:38,380
Leave!
Just get out of here!

1250
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:46,170
"I would've used stick
if I could fight with time."

1251
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:53,590
"I would've never fallen
in love if I could read a heart."

1252
01:29:54,150 --> 01:30:00,740
"I would've never fallen
in love if I could read a heart."

1253
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:16,930
"I had never thought
that my love would leave me."

1254
01:30:17,650 --> 01:30:22,460
"That she would steal my heart
then throw me out of her heart."

1255
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:28,320
"That she would steal my heart
then throw me out of her heart."

1256
01:30:28,670 --> 01:30:33,800
"For the ones who
can make a man cry.."

1257
01:30:36,690 --> 01:30:41,770
"There needs to be a punishment
for such heartbreakers."

1258
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:47,060
"There needs to be a punishment
for such heartbreakers."

1259
01:30:58,820 --> 01:31:04,110
"I have heard that a person
can go against the world for love."

1260
01:31:04,230 --> 01:31:09,350
"Then how can someone you call
your own treat you like a stranger."

1261
01:31:09,470 --> 01:31:15,200
"Then how can someone you call
your own treat you like a stranger."

1262
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:20,340
"For the ones who hurt
and take your smiles away.."

1263
01:31:23,570 --> 01:31:28,700
"There needs to be a punishment
for such heartbreakers."

1264
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:34,490
"There needs to be a punishment
for such heartbreakers."

1265
01:31:47,710 --> 01:31:52,810
"There needs to be a punishment
for such heartbreakers."

1266
01:31:53,310 --> 01:31:57,740
"There needs to be a punishment
for such heartbreakers."

1267
01:31:57,970 --> 01:31:59,800
Get in. You too.

1268
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:08,820
Thank you.

1269
01:32:10,930 --> 01:32:13,700
I had told you,
but you just won't listen.

1270
01:32:14,540 --> 01:32:15,780
What had you told me?

1271
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:17,560
That she doesn't love you.

1272
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:18,850
And she is someone's sister.

1273
01:32:18,970 --> 01:32:20,550
Whatever they did with you..

1274
01:32:20,670 --> 01:32:22,770
Anyone else in their place
would have done the same.

1275
01:32:22,890 --> 01:32:26,060
And till when are we going
to keep bailing each other out?

1276
01:32:27,310 --> 01:32:28,650
Are you doing me a favour?

1277
01:32:29,430 --> 01:32:32,150
He has lost his mind.
What are you saying?

1278
01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:35,240
We are leaving, Garewal..

1279
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:37,750
Before we forget that we are friends.

1280
01:32:38,990 --> 01:32:39,750
Sandhu..

1281
01:32:41,410 --> 01:32:42,030
Gill?

1282
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:56,670
There goes my past.

1283
01:33:00,650 --> 01:33:01,240
Mine as well.

1284
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:17,940
"You cannot walk away
from the ones you love."

1285
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:23,050
"There is no crime greater
than breaking a heart."

1286
01:33:23,170 --> 01:33:28,890
"There is no crime greater
than breaking a heart."

1287
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:34,060
"For the ones who lead
people to ruination.."

1288
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:42,350
"There needs to be a punishment
for such heartbreakers."

1289
01:33:42,810 --> 01:33:47,610
"There needs to be a punishment
for such heartbreakers."

1290
01:33:56,990 --> 01:34:02,370
"It is wrong to leave one between thorns
after making them dream about gardens."

1291
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:07,880
"It is wrong to snatch
away the dream you have shown."

1292
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:13,300
"It is wrong to snatch
away the dream you have shown."

1293
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:18,520
"For the ones who
do as they please.."

1294
01:34:21,390 --> 01:34:27,040
"There needs to be a punishment
for such heartbreakers."

1295
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:32,670
- Dimpy?
- Yes, brother?

1296
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:34,760
Do you have a girlfriend?

1297
01:34:35,210 --> 01:34:36,840
Girlfriend? No, brother.

1298
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,020
We had thought we'd come
to Chandigarh and have a girlfriend.

1299
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:40,910
And here I have only made enemies.

1300
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:43,460
Sometimes there is betrayal
and sometimes there is this.

1301
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:44,430
Right.

1302
01:34:44,550 --> 01:34:45,850
Don't worry. Have patience.

1303
01:34:46,210 --> 01:34:47,380
Everything will be fine.

1304
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:50,520
Stop! Stop!

1305
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:51,610
What happened?
Do you need to pee again?

1306
01:34:51,730 --> 01:34:52,480
- No.
- Then?

1307
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:53,990
Pull over quickly.

1308
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:57,450
You demand a lot of service, brother.

1309
01:34:58,050 --> 01:34:59,980
Stop. Stop right here.

1310
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:02,340
What happened?

1311
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,140
We need to check
this restaurant as well.

1312
01:35:05,650 --> 01:35:10,260
Sandhu used to get drunk
and demand to eat here.

1313
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:11,170
So far away?

1314
01:35:11,290 --> 01:35:12,820
We used to say the same.

1315
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:14,820
But he wouldn't budge.
He used to come here.

1316
01:35:15,270 --> 01:35:15,740
Let's go.

1317
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:17,160
- Let's check over here.
- Come on, Sharan.

1318
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:19,530
- Come on.
- Come on, help me get down.

1319
01:35:21,390 --> 01:35:23,120
Hey, help me get down as well.

1320
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:25,030
They are leaving me behind, idiots.

1321
01:35:25,150 --> 01:35:26,830
How will you recognise him?

1322
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:29,050
None of them looks like Sandhu,
brother.

1323
01:35:29,170 --> 01:35:31,290
Come what may,
we need to find Sandhu today.

1324
01:35:33,810 --> 01:35:35,150
And here I am.

1325
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:37,330
- What do you want from Sandhu?
- You are mistaken, brother.

1326
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:39,190
Kang, help us out here.

1327
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:45,450
I will wait for you till
the wedding takes place.

1328
01:35:45,530 --> 01:35:47,630
Otherwise, I will accept
whatever God wills.

1329
01:35:47,710 --> 01:35:49,700
But you will always remain my soulmate.

1330
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:50,910
Your Simran.

1331
01:36:07,450 --> 01:36:10,060
- Yes, son?
- How are you, father?

1332
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:12,640
- Are you in the jeep or the plane?
- Jeep.

1333
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:15,450
Father, did you sell the land already?

1334
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:19,010
If only I had gone there.

1335
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:20,670
Don't sell it.

1336
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:22,600
We'll do farming now.

1337
01:36:29,050 --> 01:36:31,440
Those scoundrels didn't stop,
they managed to find him.

1338
01:36:31,850 --> 01:36:34,100
Bhaana, give the bag to mother.

1339
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:36,110
Tell her that I'll come over in
the morning with her daughter-in-law.

1340
01:36:36,230 --> 01:36:37,230
Okay, brother.

1341
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:39,560
I've spent my life with them..

1342
01:36:39,890 --> 01:36:41,760
..and I am yet to understand
this father-son duo.

1343
01:36:52,430 --> 01:36:54,510
Yes, uncle.
I am coming. You play the next song.

1344
01:36:54,630 --> 01:36:55,770
Yes, I am coming.

1345
01:37:01,150 --> 01:37:03,840
They are sloshed outside.
They are dancing like crazy.

1346
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:05,820
He are so excited about my wedding.

1347
01:37:05,940 --> 01:37:08,160
Actually, we are having a wedding
in this family after a long time.

1348
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:10,350
My uncle is playing
a handkerchief like a flute.

1349
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:12,480
I don't know which snake
he intends to capture.

1350
01:37:12,710 --> 01:37:14,500
That's why everyone is sloshed.

1351
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:16,490
Are you alright?

1352
01:37:17,290 --> 01:37:17,990
Yes.

1353
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:29,890
May I lift the veil?

1354
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:41,000
You are so beautiful.

1355
01:37:41,830 --> 01:37:47,360
I always wished that my wife to
be more beautiful than Kareena Kapoor.

1356
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:50,550
My wish has been fulfilled.

1357
01:37:57,320 --> 01:37:58,700
Someone's phone's ringing.

1358
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:00,740
It's yours.

1359
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:02,940
You have made me so happy.

1360
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:06,760
They say that after marriage a girl
gives everything she has to her husband.

1361
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:08,450
You can answer your phone.

1362
01:38:08,570 --> 01:38:10,490
No, it is your phone.

1363
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:11,210
Mine?

1364
01:38:11,630 --> 01:38:12,400
Oh.

1365
01:38:15,230 --> 01:38:16,780
It's Sandhu. My friend.

1366
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:18,860
Sandhu.
He has gone to Canada.

1367
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:21,190
You are calling me
from the plane as well?

1368
01:38:21,310 --> 01:38:22,130
No.

1369
01:38:22,550 --> 01:38:23,400
Then where are you?

1370
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:24,970
Outside your house.

1371
01:38:25,090 --> 01:38:25,960
Come on out.

1372
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:29,830
It's my wedding night.

1373
01:38:29,950 --> 01:38:30,840
We'll meet in the morning.

1374
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:32,760
We aren't taking you anywhere.

1375
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:33,850
We just want to talk to you.

1376
01:38:33,970 --> 01:38:35,290
Then talk to me on phone.

1377
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:36,690
Don't make me slap you.

1378
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:38,400
You can leave after you hear us out.

1379
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:40,640
Damn..

1380
01:38:42,890 --> 01:38:44,720
He loves me a lot.

1381
01:38:45,740 --> 01:38:48,770
I'll be back in just two minutes.

1382
01:38:49,030 --> 01:38:49,650
Huh?

1383
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,250
I'll lift it again after I come back.

1384
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:54,900
Two minutes.

1385
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:58,300
Don't go to sleep.
I'll be right back.

1386
01:39:05,070 --> 01:39:07,200
It's not like getting
angry would change things.

1387
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:09,000
Don't get angry and get to work.

1388
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:11,070
Find out where can we find Simran.

1389
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:15,710
Will you be able to spend your wedding
with your wife if you stare at me?

1390
01:39:18,340 --> 01:39:19,850
Simran's always with Dolly.
Where is Dolly?

1391
01:39:20,090 --> 01:39:21,170
No, brother.

1392
01:39:21,290 --> 01:39:23,890
I owe her money.
I cannot go before her.

1393
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:32,460
- Dolly, I...
- Shut up!

1394
01:39:32,780 --> 01:39:33,780
Not a word.

1395
01:39:33,860 --> 01:39:36,540
You know I had to pay all
that you owed to the kitty group.

1396
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:37,860
I'll pay you back.

1397
01:39:38,030 --> 01:39:40,220
Sandhu might have the money.

1398
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:41,990
I'll pay you as soon as he comes back.

1399
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:45,420
I am in a bad shape
and you still slapped me.

1400
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,530
You should at least see
whether we have an audience.

1401
01:39:48,970 --> 01:39:50,570
Stop being angry now.

1402
01:39:50,910 --> 01:39:51,840
Love you.

1403
01:39:52,390 --> 01:39:54,080
Shameless.

1404
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:19,450
I am sorry, Rajveer.

1405
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:21,430
I misunderstood you.

1406
01:40:35,670 --> 01:40:38,210
- He'd broken our bones.
- This was necessary.

1407
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:03,060
Gill, I am getting a call.

1408
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:04,970
Take it out of my pocket.

1409
01:41:05,370 --> 01:41:06,700
Damn you!

1410
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:10,660
It's Dolly.

1411
01:41:11,050 --> 01:41:12,300
Yes Dolly, my sweetheart?

1412
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,960
Jagga knows everything.

1413
01:41:15,310 --> 01:41:16,610
Don't go through the bypass.

1414
01:41:16,690 --> 01:41:17,610
Change your route.

1415
01:41:18,810 --> 01:41:20,220
Okay, love you.

1416
01:41:22,290 --> 01:41:23,840
I am not going to elope with you.

1417
01:41:24,070 --> 01:41:25,240
I am going to marry you.

1418
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:27,370
Good that they are waiting on the way.

1419
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:29,880
Otherwise, we would have
to go to your house.

1420
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:31,840
- What's say Gill?
- Yes. But...

1421
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:42,590
Sandhu...

1422
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:35,470
- Hey.
- No.

1423
01:42:35,550 --> 01:42:36,530
Have you ever been thrashed?

1424
01:42:36,730 --> 01:42:38,300
No brother,
we have managed to escape so far.

1425
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:40,150
Same goes for Sandhu.

1426
01:42:40,310 --> 01:42:42,860
But those who are with
him always do get thrashed.

1427
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:48,150
He has dared to mess with Jagga.

1428
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:51,870
Get rid of him.

1429
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:59,740
Be careful but,
that's my sister with him.

1430
01:43:31,890 --> 01:43:33,300
What happened?
Are you alright?

1431
01:44:36,570 --> 01:44:38,700
Come on, we won't spare him today.

1432
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:51,860
There are no blankets
for the meet and greet.

1433
01:44:52,670 --> 01:44:54,330
So I'll greet your relatives
with a hockey stick.

1434
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,260
You...

1435
01:47:34,970 --> 01:47:36,160
That's Garewal.

1436
01:48:04,450 --> 01:48:05,290
Didn't I say?

1437
01:48:05,370 --> 01:48:07,530
When I will take a stand,
I will be rock solid like a mountain.

1438
01:48:07,610 --> 01:48:09,070
No one will be able to move me.

1439
01:48:48,330 --> 01:48:50,480
The type of a person you are...

1440
01:48:51,170 --> 01:48:53,200
...you need someone like
me as your son-in-law.

1441
01:48:55,640 --> 01:48:56,860
And not like him.

1442
01:48:59,710 --> 01:49:01,990
I want you to hand her over to me.

1443
01:49:08,980 --> 01:49:12,780
Brother, I know that you
love me more than you love yourself.

1444
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:15,300
And I love Rajveer just as much.

1445
01:49:18,470 --> 01:49:20,320
I won't be able live without him.

1446
01:49:21,860 --> 01:49:24,260
When he learnt that
you are blocking the way...

1447
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:26,050
...he could have easily changed the route.

1448
01:49:27,470 --> 01:49:28,850
But he doesn't want to elope with me.

1449
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:31,340
He wants to marry me.

1450
01:49:36,510 --> 01:49:39,050
You are quite hot-tempered, aren't you?

1451
01:49:41,450 --> 01:49:44,390
Let me riddle you with
six bullets and cool you down.

1452
01:49:44,950 --> 01:49:46,170
Put it down.

1453
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:48,710
Gunpowder causes an increase
of production of blood in my body.

1454
01:49:48,890 --> 01:49:53,910
And when that happens,
I tie up men to my jeep.

1455
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:57,810
If you still have doubts then go ahead.

1456
01:49:58,460 --> 01:49:59,670
- Damn you...
- Kaala.

1457
01:49:59,750 --> 01:50:00,580
Shoot me!

1458
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:10,340
He is right.

1459
01:50:10,750 --> 01:50:14,410
We need a son-in-law like him.

1460
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:23,920
- Come here.
- Brother.

1461
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,490
May God bless you.

1462
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:34,100
Here you go.

1463
01:50:34,180 --> 01:50:36,540
- Amazing!
- You are great, Sandhu brother!
