Your application.

2053
02:00:11,150 --> 02:00:13,280
You wrote that you’re my son.

2054
02:00:14,830 --> 02:00:17,070
That is when I was sure you are my son.

2055
02:00:17,740 --> 02:00:18,610
Yes!

2056
02:00:18,860 --> 02:00:20,650
My people are in Trinetra.

2057
02:00:24,990 --> 02:00:27,530
I knew you wouldn’t come for me.

2058
02:00:27,650 --> 02:00:28,950
I knew that you wouldn’t agree.

2059
02:00:30,780 --> 02:00:32,860
You’ve been nurtured that way for 20 years.

2060
02:00:33,110 --> 02:00:36,110
You serve your country in the army,Tricolour or Trinetra.

2061
02:00:36,610 --> 02:00:41,610
If I came for you Satyaand Trinetra would kill me.

2062
02:00:42,860 --> 02:00:44,900
They called me a terrorist.

2063
02:00:46,860 --> 02:00:49,740
You are my son.That is why I couldn’t stay away.

2064
02:00:50,740 --> 02:00:53,530
I started this plan whenyou joined Trinetra.

I set you up.

2068
02:01:02,650 --> 02:01:04,030
They would definitely kill you.

2069
02:01:04,860 --> 02:01:09,240
You won’t have friends, food,shelter or any other way to live.

2070

That was the way to bring you to me.

You will be with me.

2075

This country has forced me todo so much to get my son back.

My biggest weapon was.

2078
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:38,240
Sameera.

2079
02:01:39,650 --> 02:01:41,200
She’s one of our best soldiers.

2080
02:01:41,860 --> 02:01:43,740
I asked her to get close to you,influence you

2081
02:01:43,820 --> 02:01:46,110
and find about you and Satya.

2082
02:01:47,110 --> 02:01:48,360
She tried hard.

2083
02:01:51,570 --> 02:01:53,150
But, you’re not that easy.

2084
02:01:55,990 --> 02:01:58,200
We surprised Sameera also.

2085
02:02:04,610 --> 02:02:06,110
We asked her to give you this injection.

2086
02:02:07,610 --> 02:02:08,320
Now?

2087
02:02:08,490 --> 02:02:09,900
We doubted her.

2088
02:02:10,610 --> 02:02:12,200
I understood then.

2089
02:02:12,650 --> 02:02:14,570
That Satya didn’t come because of her.

2090
02:02:15,990 --> 02:02:17,610
You don’t want to come tomorrow, right?

2091
02:02:18,150 --> 02:02:19,490
We will come when there is a possibility.

2092
02:02:19,740 --> 02:02:20,740
If she followed our instructions.

2093
02:02:20,780 --> 02:02:23,490
Satya would’ve been dead like Damodhar,Aacharya.

2094
02:02:23,530 --> 02:02:27,360
You would have beenunconscious and brought to me.

2095
02:02:28,740 --> 02:02:30,490
I suspected her.

2096
02:02:30,740 --> 02:02:32,240
But, she spoiled the plan.

2097
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:35,150
She didn't have the injectionwhen she came to meet you.

2098
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:39,610
Sameera didn’t know that I was watching her.

2099

I was ahead of her.

Who’s that, Shyam?

2234
02:14:08,990 --> 02:14:09,990
Will you give it like that?

2235
02:14:10,110 --> 02:14:11,400
Give it to me. I will wrap it up.

2236

02:14:14,240 --> 02:14:16,650
You went in search of Satya tothe post office at Rajahmundry.

2238
02:14:17,030 --> 02:14:19,110
That means you’re the onewho told Rana about Satya.

You set up the background check for Sameera.

What? Are you?

2241
02:14:23,740 --> 02:14:25,990
Sameera faked the background.She’s the one who did this.

2242
02:14:26,030 --> 02:14:27,900
I just can’t believe that youhave fallen for this shit!

2243
02:14:30,030 --> 02:14:31,650

2244

Computer.

2246
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:38,970
It was Rana back then.

02:14:41,240 --> 02:14:41,990
It is you now.

2248
02:14:45,490 --> 02:14:45,860

Dear Gopi,

2257
02:15:31,450 --> 02:15:33,030
I’m not who you think I am.

2258
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:36,240
I got scared to reveal the truth.

2259
02:15:37,110 --> 02:15:39,740
But, I understand that our loveis more precious than my life.

2260
02:15:40,740 --> 02:15:42,490
I thought about it.

2261
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:45,030

2262
02:15:46,360 --> 02:15:47,610

The prime minister will giveyou an official apology.

2266
02:16:01,910 --> 02:16:03,700
Will they apologize forcalling me a terrorist?

2267
02:16:04,030 --> 02:16:05,070
Something like it.

2268

You’ve got a new mission.

2269
02:16:13,360 --> 02:16:15,990
Do you remember Aacharya’s words?

2270
02:16:17,630 --> 02:16:20,640
This is a new world that can’t be seen.

2271
02:16:21,070 --> 02:16:24,510
It's a dark world conqueringthe world of light.

and loneliness.

2274

You will win and you will lose.

2275
02:16:33,440 --> 02:16:39,400
You should always be ready tosacrifice your life for your country.

2276
02:16:39,530 --> 02:16:42,030
Such soldiers should not only be atour borders but within our country.

2277
02:16:42,200 --> 02:16:44,780
They should cross every boundary.
