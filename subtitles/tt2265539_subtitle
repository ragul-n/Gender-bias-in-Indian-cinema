1
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:51,453
SECOND SHOW

2
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,015
Oh! What a rain pour.

3
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,123
ls the bus to Kunnumpara gone already?

4
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:13,090
Not yet.

5
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:20,727
Where do you have to go brother?

6
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:21,897
lt's little far off.

7
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:24,371
How far?

8
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,213
No tell me exactly
where you are going?

9
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,379
How does it matter to you
where l am going?

10
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:59,877
Thank god. A truck is coming.

11
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:06,845
Brother, could you please stop?

12
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,693
Are you going through 
Kunnumpara route?

13
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,322
No brother,
we are going to Palakkad.

14
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:23,726
Okay, start now.

15
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:28,434
Come on

16
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:29,596
Don't get drenched.

17
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,135
Are you from Kunnumpara?

18
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,142
Yeah.

19
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,276
Have you ever been to prison brother?

20
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:40,274
No right?

21
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,054
l just got released today,

22
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:47,649
Why were you in prison?

23
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,350
lt's all because of
some old mischief.

24
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,257
ln fact there is a lot to say.

25
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,602
l think the bus won't come soon.

26
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,352
lt's not enough dude,
we need some more.

27
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,821
This is Kurudi.

28
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,792
His real name is Nelson Mandela.

29
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:29,724
Nelson Mandela P.P.

30
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,259
When he was admitted in school,

31
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,394
the authorities said the name
Kurudi is not acceptable.

32
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,771
The nun who took him
there remembered that..

33
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,537
..she found him wrapped in a
People's Party paper on a June 18th.

34
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,772
June 18th being Nelson Mandela's
birth date and having got him..

35
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:49,744
..in a news paper, she just gave
him the name Nelson Mandela P.P.

36
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:53,620
This is Ikru.

37
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,024
He is our constant companion.

38
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:56,986
He is Kurudi's only asset.

39
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,657
lt is Ikru that actually
changed my life.

40
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,732
Not now, later.

41
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,566
We didn't toil so much
to earn our daily bread.

42
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,333
This is a gift for George.

43
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,184
Yeah, this is Sub Inspector George.

44
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:30,623
Move this side.

45
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,997
Oh, how dare you drive
being drunk, bastard?

46
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:45,701
What is your name?

47
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:46,939
Nelson Mandela.

48
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,172
You will try to slip away right?

49
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:51,779
Don't beat me please.

50
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,912
George became unconsciousness
on the fifth hit.

51
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,253
But isn't it disgraceful
to come back without..

52
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,688
..returning him what he gave us?

53
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:05,588
Come on.

54
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,601
Ikru dear, let's go.

55
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:17,671
Hey, Lalu.

56
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:19,606
What's the matter Ummar?

57
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,369
Won't you come for night class today?

58
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,302
Let me get fresh first.

59
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,579
By then you come home.

60
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,307
Okay dude.

61
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,382
Drive carefully dude.

62
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,674
Where is the forest...

63
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,345
Where we can't fly and reach?

64
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,931
Come on, let's go in.

65
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,336
Mom, mom.

66
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:56,844
What's the matter?

67
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:57,947
What's there for dinner?

68
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,847
When you see this, you might
think it's his house and his mom.

69
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,048
But it is not.

70
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,580
This is my house and that is my mom.

71
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,527
ln fact this is the only thing
where l am jealous of him.

72
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,887
l can't express my love the way he does.

73
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:15,564
l will do it myself mom.

74
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:19,693
l know nothing is matched
to your mom's care.

75
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:23,739
But if l allow that, she will
find out about the swelling..

76
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,604
..in my head which
l got from Geroge's hit.

77
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,508
Do you remember
today's significance?

78
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:28,775
ls it Gandhi Jayanthi?

79
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:31,104
No is it?

80
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,109
Today is your dad's
death anniversary.

81
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,167
l cried.

82
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,563
Cried like hell.

83
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,137
Not because my dad passed away.

84
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:32,235
But because l couldn't
watch the climax of the film.

85
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:33,400
Lalu.

86
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:34,404
Yeah Ummar.

87
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,470
Eat slowly Hari.

88
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:38,977
Look how he is eating.

89
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,419
Hey Ummar, did you have dinner?

90
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:51,854
l had already mom.

91
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,424
How is your class going on?

92
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:54,622
lt's going on very well.

93
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,060
Does Lalu attend classes regularly?

94
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,758
Of course he does.

95
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,866
He is the class topper.

96
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,435
Actually it's quite
relieving that he goes to..

97
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,140
..night class even though he
wanders around during the day.

98
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,373
So, what are you
planning after this?

99
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,676
l may get a job in Dubai.

100
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,540
Most probably l will go next month.

101
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:13,979
Mom, l am leaving.

102
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,011
Hey Kurudi, we will meet at
our galli after the class.

103
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:17,846
Okay dude.

104
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,921
Keep it on his head.

105
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,353
Fill it over dude.

106
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,195
What are you doing Velayudhan?

107
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,424
Fill it there.

108
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:30,233
Do it fast.

109
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,560
Hey, keep it on the other side.

110
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,734
What are you looking at?

111
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,205
Hey Lalu, since it's 8.30, you
should be careful while you go.

112
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,306
Okay dude.

113
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:41,469
What?

114
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:42,835
Nothing. l meant okay bro.

115
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,580
Hey, move move. This way.

116
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:47,615
Move, move, move.

117
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,048
Pile up the sand that way.

118
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,279
You can start now.

119
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:10,504
Sweets.

120
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,710
ls your class over?

121
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,641
Did you finish it already?

122
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:16,537
Yeah.

123
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,679
lt's good fun to drink and merry
without doing anything right?

124
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:26,046
When you slog hard why
should l bother to work buddy?

125
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,983
Or else when l go to Dubai,

126
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,928
won't l send you few dollars,

127
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,301
l mean Singapore dollars.

128
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,063
Just out of sympathy.

129
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,634
Please don't misunderstand me.

130
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:45,241
Okay.

131
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:46,870
Pour a peg for me.

132
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:47,702
You want that too?

133
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:51,815
Hey Lalu.

134
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:53,814
What's the matter Ummar?

135
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,347
Our boss asked us to go
for one more trip...

136
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:57,613
since there is no
police patrol tonight.

137
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,618
He is not coming anywhere now.

138
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,914
Don't miss out an opportunity
to make money Lalu.

139
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:02,785
Come on fast.

140
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:04,126
Go man.

141
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,054
l will come back soon dude.

142
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,063
Are you going buddy?

143
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,894
Won't l come back soon dear?

144
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,429
Don't go.

145
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,100
Keep it.

146
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:17,874
That's nice.

147
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,307
What is this Velayuthan?

148
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,985
How can you smoke like this
when there is a lot to be done?

149
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,119
Move it faster.

150
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:34,824
As it is only few trips are over,
we have many more to finish tonight.

151
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,557
Hey buddy, do it faster.

152
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,488
We need to send this
as soon as possible.

153
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:42,925
Come on fast. Fast.

154
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,424
Truck no.584, keep it started.

155
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,366
You could have waited
in our place right?

156
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,635
Buddy, Lalu.

157
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:01,883
What happened?

158
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:05,350
Few rascals hit me.

159
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,587
Who the hell dare to do that?

160
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:12,126
Listen, l wanted to drink
more when l finished ours.

161
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,822
When l went to the toddy shop,
that too was closed.

162
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:21,264
When l decided to go home, l saw Vinayan
and group are drinking near the shed.

163
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:26,909
l requested them to give me some,
and they hit me badly for asking that.

164
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:30,640
Did they really beat you up when
you just asked for some booze?

165
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,874
So don't you trust me?

166
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,262
Hey.

167
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,598
Dude, actually...

168
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,836
When l asked for some booze they denied.

169
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,271
Then, l just took the
bottle and started running.

170
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,305
They started beating me too.

171
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:02,938
That was nice.

172
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,908
l have told our boys about this.

173
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,909
They will reach
our place any moment.

174
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,510
So to how many people have
you told this already?

175
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:14,787
Abu, Neerali, Vikatan,
Abuva, almost 15 people.

176
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:15,754
They will reach there now.

177
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:16,689
There are 15 people right?

178
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:17,927
l don't think l am needed.

179
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,285
No, no. That won't do.

180
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,419
You must come with me.

181
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:21,821
Hey, that won't be okay.

182
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,292
l have a lot of work here.

183
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:28,961
So you are trying to avoid me
when l am in a trouble right?

184
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,172
Not that dude.

185
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:34,839
Hey...

186
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,811
This truck will be
filled in 15 minutes.

187
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,115
We can be back by then dude.

188
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:39,806
Come on, get in.

189
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:40,683
Start the vehicle.

190
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:43,820
Let's go.

191
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,820
Bro, l will be back right away.

192
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,037
Lalu...

193
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:01,837
Where the hell are the boys?

194
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,540
They will come now.

195
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,342
How long are we waiting now?

196
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:12,773
l am leaving.

197
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,776
Let's wait for
some more time Lalu.

198
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,087
Just two more minutes.

199
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,592
Neither the ones who
are supposed to hit nor...

200
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,126
...the ones who are supposed
to get hit haven't come.

201
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,032
See...

202
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,572
Look carefully.

203
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,514
People will come even when
Kurudi calls them, understand?

204
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,780
Kurudi is quite something, you know?!

205
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,943
Hello kids, daddy is right here.

206
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,525
Oh god! Lalu, run away.

207
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:56,584
They are the other group.

208
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:57,919
Escape.

209
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:30,090
This is what you will receive if
you don't give booze to Kurudi.

210
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,453
Come on, get on the bike.

211
00:17:55,541 --> 00:18:00,115
Hi... Raman bro.

212
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,231
Now l should sleep.

213
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,331
The day should begin.

214
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,232
A lot of things are to be done.

215
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,117
Get up man.

216
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,290
Can't you see l am sleeping?

217
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,592
The mat is enough for you
to pee at night.

218
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,123
l won't pee.

219
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,227
Keep this.

220
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:46,929
You dog.

221
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,096
Sleep now.

222
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,812
What happened last night
was like a world war.

223
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,182
You should have been
lucky to have witnessed it.

224
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:07,879
Listen bro,
l was hitting people in spin mode.

225
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,318
l just beat the pulp out of them.

226
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:15,997
When l got a kick from the
other side, l kicked his ass too.

227
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:20,300
Lalu had no idea how to fight,
so l taught him some.

228
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,865
When two guys came through
the other side, l hit...

229
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:23,632
...one of them like this.

230
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,939
After that, the other guy
came like this, l spin him.

231
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:35,775
When the last four guys came,
l gave them back nicely,

232
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,545
After that, l just ran and
reached Lalu's leftern side.

233
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:40,652
Hey Lalu,

234
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,750
it was fortunate of us to not
to have got caught by police.

235
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,327
What the hell did you do?

236
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:49,128
Sorry dude, all this
was because of Kurudi.

237
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,192
How many times did l indicate
you to move the truck aside.

238
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,800
Shit!
l shouldn't have gone at that time.

239
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,476
Hey, l will tell boss that the
next time we will do it for free.

240
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:00,600
But we should have work right?

241
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,376
Our boss is behind the bars now.

242
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:08,045
Anyways, our night class has come
to an end with last night's incident.

243
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,780
l am worried if l should resume
my peanut business like before.

244
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:18,225
Hey grandpa, get up.
l have a lot to say.

245
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:22,497
l just hit him, holding like this.

246
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:23,291
One, two,

247
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,794
Aren't you happy now
when you lost my job?

248
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,567
You lost your job?

249
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:31,104
Hey don't beat me.

250
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,970
l have an idea.

251
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:33,735
Good lord.

252
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:36,709
l have an idea.

253
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:38,736
Let's take a puff and think.

254
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,238
Take off your hands.

255
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,816
Hey buddy, two cigarettes.

256
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:05,870
Hey, get up.

257
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:06,869
Let me eat.

258
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,342
Got it. Got it.

259
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:14,849
What?

260
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,140
Fighter Vavchan.

261
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:16,482
Fighter Vavchan.

262
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:19,678
11, 12, 13, 14.

263
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,688
This is Vavachan.

264
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:22,250
Not just simply Vavachan,

265
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:23,751
Fighter Vavachan.

266
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:28,257
He is the dear brother of
Fighter Anthony who was a legend.

267
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:33,734
Once upon a time, Anthony
was the biggest rowdy in town.

268
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,665
There was not a single soul who
won't get scared hearing his name.

269
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:40,575
But,

270
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,245
one day, shockingly...

271
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:46,342
Didn't l say not to mess with me?

272
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:56,850
Oh god!

273
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:08,597
After this incident, Anthony's nick name
went to his younger brother Vavachan.

274
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,266
Fighter Vavachan.

275
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,303
Even today, he is searching
for the boy who..

276
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:14,909
..threw the fire work
at his brother.

277
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:20,745
What is the matter?

278
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,848
Vavachan, this is Lalu.

279
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,415
He is my friend.

280
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,155
But who the hell are you?

281
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:29,483
l am Nelson... Kurudi.

282
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,254
Tell me what the matter is.

283
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,788
He is in to a lot of problems.

284
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,094
Me too.

285
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,226
We came here to ask for some work.

286
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,433
ls this a labour office to get you work?

287
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:48,343
Not that, don't you have
sand traffcking business?

288
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,576
We will do a neat job of it.

289
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,480
You didn't say anything.

290
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,386
l have stopped that business
a long time back.

291
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,617
Now l am in to seizing vehicles
for which credit is overdue.

292
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,020
For that job, young kids
like you are not enough.

293
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:06,921
Are we kids?

294
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,221
You will understand who
we are when you go to the...

295
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,263
...government hospital and meet
Inspector George who is admitted there.

296
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,502
He is there in the second
ward struggling to breath.

297
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,606
Even if some 7-8 people come,
nothing will happen to us Vavachan.

298
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:23,276
No way. lt will not work out.

299
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,206
You guys go find something else.

300
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:34,782
We have seized a bike
for you Vavachan.

301
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:39,962
lsn't there a black RX 100 you were
trying to seize since a long time?

302
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,754
KL 11 D 8509

303
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:43,489
Yeah.

304
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:45,363
KL 11 D 85...

305
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:46,761
We have brought it.

306
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:48,696
The bike is outside.

307
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,170
Here is the key.

308
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,011
Which one is that one?

309
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,318
Ikru's loss was more than
what Kurudi could handle.

310
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,291
My dear kids,

311
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,926
Dear lord, who art in heaven,

312
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:17,929
Bless us.

313
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,797
This adventure was a totally
new experience for us.

314
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:28,508
Vavachan taught us to open
any kind of lock in no time.

315
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:30,843
Open it.

316
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:32,773
Move.

317
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:37,751
Stop it, slow down.

318
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,620
What are you doing?

319
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,426
lt's not opening.

320
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,492
l will get some water.

321
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,431
Lalu, Lalu. There is no water here.

322
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:58,973
Oh! No, no, no.

323
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,813
Kurudi didn't think much.

324
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,981
Keeping fighter Vavachan in
mind, he just hit the lock.

325
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:13,247
Due to god's grace we came across
the right cables to open it.

326
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:19,721
Hey, you are doing it wrong.

327
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,894
15, 16, 17, 18.

328
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,866
Like that, we finished our
first assignment successfully,

329
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:32,742
My dear kids.

330
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:40,472
Bless us. Amen.

331
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,281
Mom. Mom.

332
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,488
l am coming Hari.

333
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:51,792
Did you eat something?

334
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,892
Not yet mom.
Get me something to eat.

335
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:55,991
Wash your hands and come in.

336
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:06,266
Seeing her gloomy face, l even doubted if
that is again my dad's death anniversary.

337
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,476
What is the matter mom?

338
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,571
l met Ummar's mom today.

339
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,605
He passed in his exams
and has gone to Dubai.

340
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,848
When?

341
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,580
lt doesn't matter
when he has gone.

342
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:20,755
He has written a letter to his mom
saying that he has got a nice job.

343
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:24,323
Why don't you also try
for a good job Hari?

344
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,059
Don't worry dude.

345
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:31,561
We will find a solution for this.

346
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:33,693
lt's all because of
that bastard Ummar.

347
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,797
Why don't l tell mom that
l have also got a good job?

348
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,373
How will l ever get a job
being like this?

349
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,085
Babu, Sunil.

350
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,449
Start the work.

351
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:05,332
Get me one.

352
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:07,998
That Brahmin guy...

353
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:12,205
Eureka!

354
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:23,581
lt was a blessing in disguise.

355
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:29,556
We got contracted to seize
vehicles for that finance company,

356
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,266
Lift Lalu up.

357
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:50,139
Hey Neerali, dance man.

358
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:51,439
Vikatan.

359
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:00,922
Mom, did you see this?

360
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:03,656
Your son has got a job in
Sastha finance, as a Manager.

361
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:52,269
Our pretty little moon is the
beauty spot in the dark blue sky.

362
00:28:54,866 --> 00:29:01,078
Little trumpets are blowing all over.

363
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:09,156
lt's little merry making in our minds.

364
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:17,498
And we are on a treasure hunt
in our sweet little yatch.

365
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:55,030
Water is flowing knee deep
in our little pond.

366
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:03,511
We are dipping in to the sea and
gaining little precious pearls.

367
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:11,552
Even the sweet little birdie
is singling along with us.

368
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:20,361
Our little golden dreams
are blooming and blossoming.

369
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,361
Where the hell are you?

370
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:54,928
Get inside the car.

371
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:56,654
We have a small work to do.

372
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:58,391
Come on man.

373
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:04,764
Unusually Vavachan was really serious.

374
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,967
l could see the fire in his eyes.

375
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:10,468
25 years...

376
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:17,386
After long 25 years, Vavachan has found
the killer of his brother Anthony.

377
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,953
The boy who threw the firework.

378
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,560
Hello, yeah, no.

379
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,195
Hello woman, which is Falgu's room?

380
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,064
Which Falgu?

381
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,425
The guy who has a black mole
on his left chin.

382
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:38,568
Sir, he is in room no. 303.

383
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:40,067
What?

384
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:40,675
303.

385
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:42,672
Hey, visitors are not
allowed right now.

386
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:43,841
Hello.

387
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:47,674
Vavachan has no other thoughts
in his mind at this moment.

388
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:51,780
He is thinking only about that firework
boy with a mole on the left chin.

389
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:55,515
He left us.

390
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:57,993
ls this Falgu?

391
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:02,921
Go on.

392
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:06,460
Have l lost the way?

393
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,338
Nurse, which is room no. 303?

394
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:14,071
This is it. But...

395
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:17,673
Hey Abu, who is inside?

396
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,347
lt must be Falgu.

397
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,419
Turn that side man.

398
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,249
Falgu?

399
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,487
Even the mole is correct.

400
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,323
So you are comfortably lying
here inhaling oxygen and all?

401
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:41,526
What the hell are you doing?

402
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:44,399
What?

403
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,705
Get off woman.

404
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:47,935
Go.

405
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:52,647
Move away.

406
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:55,244
l asked you to move.

407
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:56,444
What man?

408
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:05,049
Move aside, move.

409
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:06,552
Move aside.

410
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:10,230
What are you doing?

411
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,264
Have you any idea who that is?
He is Vishnu Budhan's man.

412
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,095
Take her away man.

413
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:14,202
Shut up l say,

414
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,733
She just blew off all my stunt
skills with one single slap.

415
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,012
Fighter Vavachan was extremely happy...

416
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,980
...since he could avenge his
brother's death after 25 long years.

417
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:36,692
He laughed as if he had blown
away a fireworks company.

418
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,687
But we were wrong.

419
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:47,596
Hey Falgu,
l will beat the pulp out of you.

420
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,836
You don't need oxygen.

421
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:57,303
You know what you did to my brother?

422
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:02,750
Keep quiet.

423
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:08,286
Son...

424
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:19,463
Did you just blow it?

425
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,199
Whom are you playing with?

426
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:39,952
A dead body doesn't need an apple.

427
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:41,719
ls he dead?

428
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:43,491
Come on.

429
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,768
Hey Vikatan, don't laugh so much.

430
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,165
Vavachan could have done the
same even if you were with him.

431
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:00,499
Still,

432
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:04,806
it was hilarious to watch Vavachan coming
out from the room biting that apple.

433
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:06,379
lt was awesome.

434
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:11,180
l am wondering how can this
happen when you were around Lalu?

435
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,582
He was beaten up right?

436
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,820
Oh! Did you guys know about it?

437
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:22,431
Hey, beat him man.

438
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:26,158
For us that day was like any other day.

439
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:31,367
But that news just shocked us.

440
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:32,538
They killed Vavachan.

441
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,170
How could he mess up
with Vishnu Budhan's man?

442
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,279
Who is Vishnu Budhan?

443
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:12,974
Who is Vishnu Budhan?

444
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,346
Hey, don't you know Vishnu Budhan?

445
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,780
He is a big shot in the town.

446
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:22,922
We are jacked. l am sure.

447
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:26,319
Why don't we leave the place right away?

448
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:27,152
Right away?

449
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,092
To where?

450
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,359
Let's go to Sethu's place then.

451
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,832
Why should we leave the place
for a petty case like this?

452
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,106
You have no idea what will happen.
Come on Lalu.

453
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:44,744
Come on man.

454
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:46,005
Lalu.

455
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:47,475
Get in guys.

456
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:49,149
Don't have to do a
slow motion right now.

457
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:50,315
Come fast.

458
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:55,115
Hey, if we leave the place, those guys
will go to my house looking for us.

459
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:57,388
Mom...

460
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,528
We will shift mom
to some other place.

461
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,056
Hey guys, we will meet at
the old market at sharp 10.

462
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,264
Shut up man.

463
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,664
Abu, tell Sethu that we will be there.

464
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:10,201
Okay. Lalu.

465
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,878
Mom, mom.

466
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:19,678
Are you sleeping yet?

467
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:20,838
Why didn't you get ready?

468
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,016
Get up, fast.

469
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:23,174
Faster.

470
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,312
Where are we going to get ready?

471
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:28,814
That is... why don't we visit uncle?

472
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,016
Really mom.

473
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,255
Let's go there.

474
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:36,792
Thank god! l am glad you have
forgiven him at least now.

475
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:43,102
My dear Uncle is an arsehole who didn't
even bother to look after us...

476
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,896
...ever since my dad passed away.

477
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,075
l would have forgiven him,
if this is the only issue.

478
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:51,777
But l will never forgive him for not
letting me watch the climax of the film.

479
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,106
Come with me.

480
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:10,591
Are you Janardhanan?

481
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:11,626
Yeah.

482
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:12,898
What is the matter?

483
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:13,729
Lalu.

484
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:15,494
Stop.

485
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:17,263
Hey, who are you?

486
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,133
Look who is here. Devaki?

487
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,642
Which is this car?

488
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:27,739
This was given to Hari from his offce.

489
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:29,782
ls it new?

490
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,784
Hari, do you remember your poor uncle?

491
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,457
Why are you standing here?
Let's go in.

492
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:40,388
My uncle was just proving that he is
better than a chameleon in changing colours.

493
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:41,923
Where are you working Lalu?

494
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,030
l am working in a finance company,

495
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:45,790
Which one?

496
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:47,263
Sastha Finance.

497
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:48,999
Hari is the manager there.

498
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:50,867
Sumathi, get some tea for them.

499
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:52,737
lt's okay aunty.

500
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,873
l have a lot of work at the offce.

501
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,572
We are leaving right away.

502
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:58,712
No, that won't be done.
You can't go at this odd hour.

503
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:02,478
Let's go.

504
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,949
Mom will be here for a few days.

505
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,687
Tomorrow, l have a
meeting at the offce.

506
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,190
l need to prepare for that.

507
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:13,091
Not just that the construction
workers will come home tomorrow.

508
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:14,728
What's wrong with the house?

509
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:18,998
Nothing special.
l am just renovating the house.

510
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:20,258
Won't it cost so much?

511
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:23,902
For a Manager, it's not a big
deal to arrange some 10, 20 lakhs.

512
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:25,537
20 lakhs?

513
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:27,108
Okay then uncle.
We are making a move.

514
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:27,971
Hey, wait.

515
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:29,835
You haven't seen Geethu
in a long time right?

516
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:32,638
She mentioned about you
even today. lsn't it Sumathi?

517
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:33,578
Of course, yes.

518
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:39,818
Geethu... Geethu dear.

519
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,116
Get up.

520
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,554
Look who has come here.

521
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,195
lt's our Lalu.

522
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:01,770
l will be just right back.

523
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,047
l will burn your family down
if you try to let...

524
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,377
...mom know whatever
happened in the hospital.

525
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:12,479
You know me well right?

526
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,056
l have taken a loan for 6 lakh
rupees from Sastha Finance...

527
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:16,583
...to build this house.

528
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:20,257
Won't we get some concession
since Lalu is the manager?

529
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:23,121
Just forget it.
The loan is covered up.

530
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:25,798
lf l come to know that you
tried to pay some money...

531
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:31,006
Are you threatening me?

532
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:33,005
What happened there
was threatening.

533
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:35,437
Now it's hard core action.

534
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:38,141
Don't forget that.

535
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:39,737
Okay mom.

536
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,279
Bye bye Uncle.

537
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,151
Abu, start the car.

538
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:58,563
Dude, we are screwed.

539
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,597
Take reverse, fast.

540
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,498
Holy shit! Those guys have come.

541
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,540
Hey bro,
please get out of the car.

542
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:09,836
Hey bro,
it was a mistake by Vavachan.

543
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,379
Please don't screw us for that.

544
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,573
lt seems these guys made a mistake.

545
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:15,875
So shall we let them go?

546
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:16,881
Come out you,

547
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:17,711
Leave me.

548
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:58,688
Lalu, Vikatan.

549
00:41:59,049 --> 00:41:59,823
Hey, lift him up.

550
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:00,695
Hold him.

551
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:05,458
Get him in to the car.

552
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,726
Did we try to run away
fearing these jack asses?

553
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:09,496
Vishnu Budhan.

554
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,932
Bloody Vishnu Budhan.

555
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,945
What is your name?

556
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:25,951
La... Lalu.

557
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:29,420
He killed my confidante.

558
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,017
Yeah, but what do we do for that?

559
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,926
l liked your work.

560
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:37,688
lt has got a unique stye.

561
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,298
l have got some stuff at Soochikkotta.

562
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:47,164
You should deliver it at the right place.

563
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:54,246
When l hid my fear within me,

564
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:57,876
Budhan would have thought
that l am really brave.

565
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:11,763
l am sorry about the other day.

566
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,636
Never mind, l am used to this.

567
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,163
What about your family?

568
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,832
l have a wife and two daughters.

569
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:20,665
Are you completely in to this?

570
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:23,975
l am a police officer.

571
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:28,781
l am serious. l am a constable.

572
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:30,981
But now l am suspended from service.

573
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:33,681
Then why are you in to this?

574
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:35,149
Shouldn't l look after the family?

575
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,524
l have two daughters.

576
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:41,522
How can l live with my petty
salary from the service?

577
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:42,561
Yeah, right.

578
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:47,997
There was a man in a far away place.

579
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:54,002
There was a forest beyond time and gaze.

580
00:43:55,666 --> 00:44:00,376
He used to walk beyond hills and valleys.

581
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:05,979
He used to cross rivers and barriers.

582
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:10,382
Oh god! Time is burning in my eyes.

583
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:13,657
Everything is in to flames.

584
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:16,329
Oh god! He sings his angst.

585
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:19,291
lsn't everyone the best?

586
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:39,452
How is the stuff?

587
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,451
The stuff is good.

588
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:44,755
Rajiv ji, they are Budhan's new people.

589
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:46,685
Hello.

590
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:47,452
Yeah, hello.

591
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,561
How much did he ask for?

592
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:50,561
He just asked us to deliver it here.

593
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:54,202
Budhan sir said the rest you
will decide through telephone.

594
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:55,267
What is he saying?

595
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,100
He is saying that he was
asked to deliver it here.

596
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:00,768
The rest of the things we
should fix though phone.

597
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:03,810
What will be their demand?

598
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,447
Hello Budhan ji.

599
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:10,485
Yeah. Your stuff has reached here.

600
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:12,914
But we haven't discussed
about the rates yet.

601
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,184
Okay. That is too much sir.

602
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:19,087
lt is unreasonable sir.

603
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:24,154
Yeah, why don't you talk to Surabhi?

604
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:24,856
One minute.

605
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:26,092
Hey, what will l do?

606
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:28,862
Hello.

607
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,239
Yeah, yeah.

608
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:33,798
Okay.

609
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,241
Three boxes means
three fucking boxes!

610
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:47,814
Hi.

611
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,121
ls sir at home?

612
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:51,757
Dad is, come on in.

613
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:52,926
We will wait here.

614
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:54,622
No need for tea and all.

615
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:56,864
What the hell are you doing?

616
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:07,305
What is your name?

617
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,336
Sidhu, Sidharth Budhan.

618
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:18,476
These filthy rich cunts have got
a different air even in their names.

619
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:19,312
Keep quiet man.

620
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:24,787
Lalu...

621
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:51,642
We are on a quest to find the clouds.

622
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:57,650
We are tired carrying our own selves.

623
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:04,125
Aren't we all one and the same?

624
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:10,802
lsn't the entire world our own home?

625
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,112
Oh god!

626
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,786
Didn't you earn it
with your actions?

627
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,546
The doctor said, you would have
been dead if it was an inch above.

628
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,751
Why don't you try to live a
decent life at least from now on?

629
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,361
You know what, we do the most
decent job in our locality.

630
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:36,722
What can be expected of you guys?

631
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,090
Aren't you friends with him?

632
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,099
Nurse, l want to live decently.

633
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,906
Let me earn some money,
l will not do this after that.

634
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:49,706
We have come.

635
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,002
What happened dude?

636
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:52,213
Did you kill him?

637
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:54,507
Those who hit you
are not alive any more.

638
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:56,743
Move aside bro.

639
00:47:58,709 --> 00:47:59,710
Hey buddy.

640
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:01,152
Please give me way.

641
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:04,422
All those losers are
dug under the earth now.

642
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:06,594
Let her go Abu.

643
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:11,657
Just for fun.

644
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:16,002
How are you bro?

645
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,533
Give one to this bro.

646
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:20,604
Let him drink, sister.

647
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:54,333
Lalu, shouldn't we visit your house?

648
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:56,668
lt's been a long time
since l have come there.

649
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,281
We will all go there one day.

650
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,186
Don't worry dude.

651
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:08,923
l am with you right?

652
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,887
l am wondering what l will tell mom.

653
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:14,419
Just go and bring her here.

654
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:17,157
l will take care of the rest.

655
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:20,758
What about the stuff?

656
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:23,001
One of us will take care of it.

657
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,302
You go and have great fun buddy,

658
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:34,745
When the drum gets beaten,
we have great fun.

659
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:40,848
When the elephant slogs hard,
we are on a run.

660
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:46,819
No matter what happens,
we are on a ride

661
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:52,824
Even the sand dances
to the tunes of the tide.

662
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:59,406
Hey you sweet rascal,
you are going to get beaten.

663
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:05,442
When you get it nicely
you will learn a lesson.

664
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:15,714
When the drum gets beaten,
we have great fun.

665
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:21,892
When the elephant carries weight,
we are on a run.

666
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:56,957
What if the horse is given a horn?

667
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:59,825
What if the grass hopper
is given more height?

668
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:05,232
lt will wander all over and
turn the world upside down.

669
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:08,700
lt will leave nothing behind.

670
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:11,773
lt will ruin our peace of mind.

671
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,049
lt will change our lives forever,

672
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,275
so let's not have anymore.

673
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:27,792
Hey Lalu, our Geethu is actually nice.

674
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:29,960
She is really sweet. Nice girl.

675
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:32,824
Not that, l mean she is a hot chic.

676
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:36,597
Who is a hot chic?
Who is a hot chic?

677
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:38,966
Me, l mean me.

678
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:43,307
Look at him, he is fully drunk.

679
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:45,002
What happened?

680
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:48,413
Which is the forest?

681
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,913
Where we can't fly and reach.

682
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:52,711
Yeah,

683
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:56,387
l even made a nest
in the beautiful tree trunk.

684
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:59,619
In the beautiful tree trunk.

685
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:00,794
Vikatan ran away.

686
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,023
Why would he run away? To where?

687
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:08,566
Dude, don't blabber when you are high.

688
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:11,631
That scoundrel ran away
with Vishnu Budhan's money.

689
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:14,338
Holy shit!

690
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:18,239
Hey, he...

691
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:28,951
Hey, Budhan's car is seen.

692
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:41,160
You guys are drunk right?

693
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,211
Would you like to have one?

694
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:55,878
Yeah, sure.

695
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:22,209
Does your dad know you drink?

696
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:24,807
He will kill me if he knows.

697
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:26,571
Still l drink secretively.

698
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:39,756
Okay then, we are making a move.

699
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,261
Did you come just like that Sidhu?

700
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:45,155
Yeah, l just came here since l
was passing through this place.

701
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:46,325
You guys have fun, good night.

702
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:52,699
Hello.

703
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:53,464
Sidhu.

704
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:55,072
Yes, dad.

705
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:57,142
Bring that bag from Lalu.

706
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:58,775
Okay dad, l will bring it.

707
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,308
Didn't you give the
bag to dad today?

708
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:05,244
We will give it.

709
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:06,915
No, he asked me to get it from you.

710
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:08,816
Didn't we say we will
give that directly?

711
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:09,787
Why can't you give me?

712
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:11,389
We don't feel like.

713
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:13,595
Don't mess with me,
or else l will inform dad.

714
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:16,354
Or did you give it to someone else?

715
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,757
No, no.

716
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:20,824
Hey...

717
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:21,692
No bro.

718
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:24,697
Let's go from here.

719
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:26,329
Come let's go.

720
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,345
You will have to answer for this Lalu.

721
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:40,286
Get off. Go.

722
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:41,417
Act your age.

723
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,156
Don't show off too much.

724
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:29,894
Lalu...

725
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:31,895
Hey Kurudi.

726
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:40,446
Lalu, run.

727
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:41,341
Run away.

728
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:55,214
You son of a bitch,
l will not spare you guys.

729
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:56,950
Mind it.

730
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:11,819
l don't know if l will
have another day in my life.

731
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:16,990
But if l have,
l will make them answer for this.

732
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:19,259
That is for sure.

733
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:30,341
Hey Neerali, he gained consciousness.

734
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,440
Go inform the doctor.

735
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:34,548
Help me to get up.

736
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:37,012
Slowly,

737
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:44,421
We should not spare any of them.

738
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:46,053
Just look at yourself.

739
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:50,829
We will act at the right time dude.

740
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:55,299
Did mom know about
what happened yesterday?

741
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:59,164
What? lt's almost a week
since you are hospitalized.

742
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:02,875
Have you any idea how much
we struggled to find you?

743
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:11,813
Don't worry,
mom doesn't know anything.

744
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:14,348
We have warned her also.

745
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:16,448
Visitors should wait outside.

746
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:17,984
We need to check the patient.

747
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:21,761
Ummar's mom used to say that
usually,..

748
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:24,087
...one's children are the
enemies from their past life.

749
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:27,927
But in my case it is
in the form of my cousin.

750
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:45,813
Hello.

751
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:52,253
Okay.

752
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,060
Let's escape.

753
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:56,026
Budhan's men are here.

754
01:00:57,387 --> 01:00:59,731
Lalu, Budhan has sent people to kill us.

755
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:00,993
What the hell are you doing?

756
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:02,031
Shut up.

757
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,001
Hey please listen.

758
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:09,304
Geethu, if mom asks tell her l have
gone abroad for official purposes.

759
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:10,342
Where are you going?

760
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:12,035
To Punjab.

761
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:14,811
Where is Kurudi?

762
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:16,341
He is admitted in
the ward downstairs.

763
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:17,978
Hey Kurudi.

764
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:21,179
Run off, Budhan is coming.

765
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:23,388
Come on.

766
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,089
lt was an aimless journey,

767
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:33,933
l have no idea how far we went.

768
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,896
Finally we reached Sethu's place.

769
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:46,242
How long have l been
inviting you home?

770
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:47,810
And finally this is
how you are coming.

771
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:50,416
That is destiny,

772
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,516
Come on in.

773
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:57,223
Thanks.

774
01:01:57,413 --> 01:01:58,858
What for?

775
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:01,989
Because you didn't tell
anything to anybody,

776
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:04,188
l didn't tell anything,
not because you threatened me.

777
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:05,658
Then?

778
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:09,002
Anyways, aunty will
find out the truth soon.

779
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:07,246
When l was lying in that drainage,
l had never imagined that...

780
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,072
...l will witness another
new year like this.

781
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:15,313
l wanted to take revenge
for all that happened.

782
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:20,625
That car came reinforcing my desires.

783
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:27,363
Dude...

784
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:34,335
lt was you!

785
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:39,608
Did you get a trip to Kashmir?

786
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:40,474
Hey, nothing like that.

787
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:41,773
lt is that boy's clothes.

788
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:43,112
Which boy's..?

789
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:45,779
Boss, happy new year.

790
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:48,555
Girls get in.

791
01:05:50,746 --> 01:05:51,554
Francis road.

792
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:54,818
Do you want it to be
air conditioned?

793
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:55,689
AC.

794
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:02,798
Do you have a lighter?

795
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,236
l have a match box.

796
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,461
But don't smoke inside this.

797
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,006
You can lower the window and smoke.

798
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:11,344
l have no issues, but my boss
has given me instructions.

799
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,038
That is why.

800
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:14,373
l will smoke inside itself.

801
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:15,673
Give me the match stick.

802
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,147
Sorry, l can't give you.

803
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:24,152
l booked this taxi. l will smoke,
drink and even fuck around.

804
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:25,619
Who the hell are you
to question me?

805
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:27,425
Who the hell am l?

806
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:35,965
Sir, could you please
come out for a second?

807
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:51,180
Holy shit!

808
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:56,386
You must smoke from inside right?

809
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:02,924
Stop your bloody laughter.

810
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:05,223
Now those guys will
come looking for us.

811
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:10,663
Hey, l haven't told him
that we are all here.

812
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:14,800
lf you inform your dad about
this and come looking for us...

813
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:17,501
...in the Pavadamukku area,
Lalu will beat the pulp out of you.

814
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:18,134
Son of a bitch.

815
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:32,689
Everybody was worried thinking
whether to be worried.

816
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:36,986
And soon we got an answer for it.

817
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:50,702
Sethu.

818
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:52,543
Leave me Abu.

819
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:53,779
Let me see.

820
01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:55,647
Holy crap!

821
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:56,781
Didn't you see this Lalu?

822
01:07:58,274 --> 01:07:59,082
They ruined everything.

823
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:01,013
What do we do now?

824
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:05,825
Lalu, this must be Budhan's people.

825
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:06,924
Let's move to some other place.

826
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:09,127
Where will we go?

827
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,765
We are not going anywhere.

828
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:21,508
Aren't you happy now?

829
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:22,468
Leave him.

830
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:24,311
This is...

831
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:25,343
lt's ringing from your pocket.

832
01:08:25,734 --> 01:08:26,906
lt is that boy's phone.

833
01:08:28,471 --> 01:08:29,472
Who is calling?

834
01:08:29,905 --> 01:08:31,145
D A D.

835
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,685
lt is Vishnu Budhan.

836
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:39,258
Attend the call.

837
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:41,392
Listen Sidhu,
our truck is coming that way.

838
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:43,188
KL 112905.

839
01:08:43,686 --> 01:08:44,721
You must keep an eye on it.

840
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:46,722
Hey, turn right, right.

841
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:07,778
He was going to Francis road.

842
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:24,835
Get off you...

843
01:09:26,362 --> 01:09:26,965
Sethu...

844
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:28,765
Take it.

845
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:30,977
Take the stuff.

846
01:09:32,768 --> 01:09:33,838
Fast, fast, fast.

847
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:43,214
Hello.

848
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:44,986
Did the truck go son?

849
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:49,694
Not just the truck daddy,
even your stuff is gone.

850
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:51,757
Who the hell are you?

851
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:53,992
You will slowly understand who l am.

852
01:09:55,758 --> 01:09:57,999
Whatever you were doing
till now was a mock game.

853
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:03,603
We will show you
the real game from now on.

854
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:31,236
The rain has stopped.

855
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,172
Why don't we slowly
start walking?

856
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:36,332
You are right.

857
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:38,403
l don't think we will get
the bus if we wait anymore.

858
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:40,706
Let's walk up to the highway.

859
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:42,014
We may get a taxi from there.

860
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:46,145
Then what happened?

861
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:52,182
We started again from where we stopped.

862
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:02,065
SECOND SHOW

863
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:03,969
We don't want Budhan's stuff.

864
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:05,728
lsn't he dealing with Fellini now?

865
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,208
You leave those things to us.

866
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:10,067
How much will you give for this?

867
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:10,901
Say that.

868
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,074
What is going on?

869
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:16,974
This is not Budhan's stuff.

870
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:20,217
This is ours.

871
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:23,053
Mine.

872
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:26,551
Come on in kids.

873
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:27,292
Come in.

874
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,264
Hello.

875
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:33,128
Where is our stuff?

876
01:11:33,822 --> 01:11:35,495
But aren't you dealing with Fellini?

877
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:36,830
Don't fuck with me bitch.

878
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:38,799
You don't know me enough.

879
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:42,174
We only have to fear the elephant,
not its poo.

880
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:46,445
Elephant poo!

881
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:50,816
Elephant poo.

882
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,015
Elephant poo.

883
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:54,052
Elephant poo.

884
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:58,707
Devaki, Hari has come.

885
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:04,083
Hari, you look nice now.

886
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:06,514
Why did you come alone?

887
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:08,311
Had we known earlier, uncle would have
come to pick you from the airport.

888
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:08,751
Yeah.

889
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:10,048
That's okay aunty.

890
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:11,490
Hari...

891
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:13,849
Have you eaten?

892
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:15,716
Yeah mom. l had.

893
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:16,286
Come in.

894
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:17,395
Come.

895
01:14:22,057 --> 01:14:22,626
Geethu.

896
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:23,836
Yeah.

897
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,438
Are you reading something?

898
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,544
Yes.

899
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:38,714
Argentina is my favourite football team.

900
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:43,848
Last year, Brazil won the match.

901
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:47,117
But we will win the game in 2006.

902
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:53,431
Saddam Hussain is my favourite leader.

903
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:58,929
But Bush can't do anything against him.

904
01:14:59,394 --> 01:15:00,839
Why are you telling me
about your favourite things?

905
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:03,474
Then l will tell you what l don't like.

906
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:07,771
l just don't like your dad, my uncle.

907
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:12,043
lt's high time
he should be under the grave.

908
01:15:12,207 --> 01:15:13,880
lf you don't like my dad,
why did you come here with your mom?

909
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:16,915
lt is then that l understood,
there is one good thing he had done.

910
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,761
l have an interview
at the Airlines tomorrow.

911
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:31,199
lf you get me that job,
l will consider this.

912
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:37,872
Did you buy this from Poland?

913
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:39,804
What? Yeah, yeah.

914
01:15:40,435 --> 01:15:41,140
Poland.

915
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:43,505
Dad, l am leaving.

916
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:45,010
Pray to god before you leave dear.

917
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:46,980
Nothing will happen because of that.

918
01:15:47,142 --> 01:15:48,143
Hey, your folder.

919
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:50,583
l am just considering it
as an experience.

920
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:52,820
Drop her in the car.

921
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:55,426
Okay mom.

922
01:15:58,754 --> 01:15:59,528
Hey...

923
01:15:59,955 --> 01:16:00,729
You sit behind.

924
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:02,233
Sit behind.

925
01:16:06,628 --> 01:16:07,663
Geethu, you sit in front.

926
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:10,842
No thanks. l will sit behind.

927
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:12,175
Listen to what l say Geethu.

928
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:13,171
Sit in front.

929
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:16,214
Do whatever.

930
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:24,923
lsn't that our boys?

931
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:46,741
Hello.

932
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:50,613
Which theater?

933
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:52,310
Okay.

934
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:54,644
Let's go to Sobha theater.

935
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:56,085
Why are we going to a theater?

936
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:57,188
l have an interview.

937
01:16:57,312 --> 01:16:58,086
l have to go that side.

938
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:00,752
We will watch a film
and go sister.

939
01:17:30,779 --> 01:17:31,883
This is just an advance.

940
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:34,018
Don't forget about next week.

941
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:34,927
Hey Kurudi...

942
01:17:37,285 --> 01:17:38,389
Who is that cute saree chic?

943
01:17:39,554 --> 01:17:40,760
Sister.

944
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:41,897
Whose sister?

945
01:17:42,124 --> 01:17:42,795
His sister.

946
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:43,967
Hello.

947
01:18:29,905 --> 01:18:30,883
What is your name?

948
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:32,079
Geethanjali.

949
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:48,724
lt's enough.

950
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:49,968
How long should l wait?

951
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:54,137
Hey do we...

952
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:58,670
Yeah, at Pulimmottu, didn't we?

953
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:00,677
Don't you remember sir?

954
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:02,138
Now l got you.

955
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:03,244
How come you are here?

956
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:05,540
l am all in all here.

957
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:07,910
Then, she must have got
the job already right?

958
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:11,113
She is my cousin.

959
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:14,217
Geethu, Geethanjali.

960
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:15,290
Why not?

961
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:16,721
She is highly talented.

962
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:19,096
We were just discussing about it.

963
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,030
You will be able to join
tomorrow itself right?

964
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:23,401
Yeah.

965
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:24,966
Please get the appointment
order from downstairs.

966
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:26,067
l will inform them.

967
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:27,765
Okay sir.

968
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,037
Thanks.

969
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:35,743
What for?

970
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:38,110
l had never imagined
that l will get this job.

971
01:19:38,673 --> 01:19:41,449
You got this job,
not because you are blessed.

972
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:43,787
lt's because we share
such a good relationship.

973
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:45,854
You won't give the key right?

974
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:47,990
You can't vacate the house right?

975
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:50,924
Please, please.

976
01:19:51,153 --> 01:19:51,893
Please leave me.

977
01:19:52,521 --> 01:19:53,124
l will do whatever you say.

978
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,765
Don't be afraid.

979
01:19:55,023 --> 01:19:57,663
So you vacate the house tomorrow
itself and give the key to Vavachan.

980
01:19:59,161 --> 01:20:00,037
Please.

981
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:01,565
l will give back the key.

982
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:33,771
Will...

983
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:38,504
Will...

984
01:20:40,035 --> 01:20:40,604
Will you...

985
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:45,074
Will you, will you...

986
01:20:46,308 --> 01:20:47,082
Will you...

987
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:48,679
Will you...

988
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:49,615
Will you marry me?

989
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:51,516
Not me, him.

990
01:20:54,082 --> 01:20:55,152
Will you marry me?

991
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:02,191
No.

992
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:09,938
l said like that yesterday because
l thought l will never get this job.

993
01:21:10,398 --> 01:21:12,002
First you earn a decent living.

994
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:13,345
l will consider then.

995
01:21:21,276 --> 01:21:25,190
To fall in love with a goon,
it's not a movie right?

996
01:21:26,448 --> 01:21:33,423
Kurudi watched a lot of English films
just to make this work.

997
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:36,626
And finally it ended like this.

998
01:21:37,092 --> 01:21:38,332
Boys come on.

999
01:22:30,745 --> 01:22:36,491
ls the little water lilly blooming?

1000
01:22:37,519 --> 01:22:44,596
Or are the birds making
a nest for the new one?

1001
01:22:44,726 --> 01:22:46,069
l don't understand what is going on.

1002
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:47,399
What's with you brother?

1003
01:22:47,562 --> 01:22:50,634
l really don't like the way it is
your people are dealing with me.

1004
01:22:50,832 --> 01:22:52,277
Come on Fellini.

1005
01:22:52,867 --> 01:22:53,709
l guarantee you...

1006
01:22:54,402 --> 01:22:56,780
You will get more than
what you have asked for.

1007
01:22:57,572 --> 01:22:59,483
Two of my lorries
will be under your belt.

1008
01:23:00,942 --> 01:23:02,478
Lalu is behind all this.

1009
01:23:02,877 --> 01:23:07,758
This is just a petty game by
ball-less kids. Let them play it.

1010
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:23,201
Do you want grass?

1011
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:26,537
He is asking if you want stuff?

1012
01:23:28,937 --> 01:23:29,745
How much?

1013
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:32,879
Just 1000 rupees only.

1014
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:44,425
This much costs only 10000.

1015
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:48,565
Then how can it be 1000
for a candy like that?

1016
01:24:22,424 --> 01:24:23,698
Lalu...

1017
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:30,241
We knew that you are here.

1018
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:36,571
Kurudi, l made a mistake.

1019
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:41,584
That is okay,

1020
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:44,382
We just wanted to play with you.

1021
01:24:45,647 --> 01:24:47,126
lt's okay dude.

1022
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:50,796
This was just a game.

1023
01:24:54,122 --> 01:24:55,999
How did you find me?

1024
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:02,499
Kohinoor Leela.

1025
01:25:11,139 --> 01:25:16,384
You guys haven't lef her even
after crossing expiry time right?

1026
01:25:29,224 --> 01:25:29,998
Vikatan...

1027
01:25:46,307 --> 01:25:49,117
Didn't you escape by
an inch's difference then?

1028
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:51,052
That will not happen again.

1029
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:17,439
ls the barren land becoming fertile?

1030
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:25,215
Or is it reaping gold on its own?

1031
01:26:25,914 --> 01:26:32,354
Who is building the grand palace?

1032
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:39,330
Or who is gathering all the force?

1033
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:46,145
Yeah Surabhi.

1034
01:26:46,568 --> 01:26:47,273
Did the stuff reach?

1035
01:26:47,969 --> 01:26:48,447
Not yet.

1036
01:26:50,338 --> 01:26:50,839
When will it reach?

1037
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:52,977
Just 10 minutes.

1038
01:26:53,274 --> 01:26:53,752
10 minutes.

1039
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:09,328
Where have you reached?

1040
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:10,228
We have...

1041
01:27:10,525 --> 01:27:11,367
Turn the vehicle.

1042
01:27:12,794 --> 01:27:13,295
Church road.

1043
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:15,167
Stop it guys.

1044
01:27:15,296 --> 01:27:15,933
Okay dude.

1045
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:05,483
Who is building the grand palace?

1046
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:12,230
Or who is gathering all the force?

1047
01:28:25,867 --> 01:28:28,177
Aunty, your son has come.

1048
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:31,607
Why are you standing outside?

1049
01:28:31,873 --> 01:28:32,544
Come on in.

1050
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:51,198
Have tea.

1051
01:28:53,594 --> 01:28:55,938
Gulp it fast. You will be fresh.

1052
01:29:05,106 --> 01:29:08,087
ls it enough?
May l give you one more cup?

1053
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:09,078
lt is enough.

1054
01:29:13,815 --> 01:29:15,089
Let's go home Hari.

1055
01:29:15,316 --> 01:29:16,488
What is going on here?

1056
01:29:16,918 --> 01:29:18,295
Please tell me clearly.

1057
01:29:18,486 --> 01:29:19,260
l will tell you.

1058
01:29:20,288 --> 01:29:23,030
Hope you know that l have
taken a loan of 6 lakh rupees...

1059
01:29:23,091 --> 01:29:24,729
...from your finance company.

1060
01:29:25,226 --> 01:29:28,696
lt has become 10 lakh rupees,
including interest.

1061
01:29:31,099 --> 01:29:33,511
l didn't pay back the money
because your...

1062
01:29:33,601 --> 01:29:35,103
...friend Kurudi told me not to.

1063
01:29:35,536 --> 01:29:36,571
Did Kurudi say so?

1064
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:39,350
l had no idea uncle.

1065
01:29:39,507 --> 01:29:40,713
Now you have an idea right?

1066
01:29:40,975 --> 01:29:41,919
You don't worry Uncle.

1067
01:29:43,077 --> 01:29:44,078
l will take care of it.

1068
01:29:45,813 --> 01:29:48,521
Didn't l tell you he would
not have been aware of it?

1069
01:29:48,683 --> 01:29:49,559
Yeah.

1070
01:29:49,884 --> 01:29:51,830
Won't that loan be written off son?

1071
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:59,296
Even though he agreed
to write off the loan,

1072
01:29:59,427 --> 01:30:00,963
shouldn't we go there
and confirm it?

1073
01:30:01,629 --> 01:30:02,699
But for that, why are
you taking me along?

1074
01:30:03,264 --> 01:30:04,504
Oh, that is because...

1075
01:30:04,832 --> 01:30:06,675
Do you think l will spend 100 bucks
on the auto just like that?

1076
01:30:06,868 --> 01:30:08,472
l am concerned about your future.

1077
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:10,643
You should have an idea
about his work space.

1078
01:30:15,376 --> 01:30:16,582
Stop here.

1079
01:30:19,013 --> 01:30:19,354
How much is it?

1080
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:20,356
100.

1081
01:30:22,016 --> 01:30:23,324
Here, keep it.

1082
01:30:23,785 --> 01:30:24,263
Come.

1083
01:30:26,687 --> 01:30:28,530
You are really lucky dear.

1084
01:30:30,591 --> 01:30:31,433

1085
01:30:31,626 --> 01:30:32,400
Have you got an appointment?

1086
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:34,736
l am his uncle.

1087
01:30:35,062 --> 01:30:36,040
Why do l need an appointment?

1088
01:30:36,464 --> 01:30:38,535
He will come only by 12.
Please wait till then.

1089
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:39,269
Okay, l will wait.

1090
01:30:58,052 --> 01:30:58,962
Sir has come.

1091
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:18,042
Lalu, we have been
waiting for a long time.

1092
01:31:18,339 --> 01:31:20,080
l am sorry uncle,
my flight was delayed.

1093
01:31:20,575 --> 01:31:21,485
You go sit inside.

1094
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:32,290
Mom said that l can't be a government
offcial since l have failed in high school.

1095
01:31:33,688 --> 01:31:39,297
But since you wanted your husband to be
an offcer, l bought a few shares here.

1096
01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:43,398
Now l am earning
more than 3 lakhs a month.

1097
01:31:47,134 --> 01:31:51,276
Now you can fall in love with a
rowdi like in the movies right?

1098
01:31:54,442 --> 01:32:01,485
lf you had proposed today, my answer
wouldn't have been like the other day.

1099
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:32,380
The sun is fading away in to the ocean.

1100
01:32:32,813 --> 01:32:36,818
But you are with me as a lovely moon.

1101
01:32:37,151 --> 01:32:40,689
The breeze is patting me gently.

1102
01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:44,931
The waves are embracing my foot slowly,

1103
01:32:45,359 --> 01:32:49,830
Tme is passing by.

1104
01:32:49,931 --> 01:32:53,378
You are leaning on to me.

1105
01:32:53,768 --> 01:32:57,580
You are patting my cheeks...

1106
01:32:57,972 --> 01:33:02,250
...and singing a melody in my ears.

1107
01:33:06,547 --> 01:33:07,924
For the dream to stay...

1108
01:33:08,115 --> 01:33:09,651
...and for the love to bloom,

1109
01:33:10,351 --> 01:33:12,024
l searched for you...

1110
01:33:12,253 --> 01:33:13,857
...in my own self.

1111
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:56,970
Could you please stop it?

1112
01:33:59,033 --> 01:33:59,477
What happened dear?

1113
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:00,742
Didn't you like the song?

1114
01:34:02,069 --> 01:34:02,740
Nothing.

1115
01:34:02,837 --> 01:34:03,315
You can play it.

1116
01:34:24,759 --> 01:34:26,898
You go get a bouquet.

1117
01:34:27,094 --> 01:34:28,072
Why do we need a bouquet?

1118
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:31,540
Go buy one.
l need to present it someone.

1119
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:34,869
l don't feel like getting out now.

1120
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:36,508
You can buy if you want to buy,

1121
01:34:38,372 --> 01:34:39,180
Please go dear.

1122
01:34:39,407 --> 01:34:40,112
You buy one.

1123
01:34:42,777 --> 01:34:45,189
Why are you doing this sweets?

1124
01:34:45,413 --> 01:34:46,153
Get out man.

1125
01:34:54,722 --> 01:34:58,397
You guys think of me
like an intruder right?

1126
01:34:58,726 --> 01:34:59,466
Go go.

1127
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:03,765
What do you want?

1128
01:35:08,102 --> 01:35:08,944
l haven't taken money.

1129
01:35:09,303 --> 01:35:10,077
Bro, just a second.

1130
01:35:12,573 --> 01:35:14,075
Hey, give me some money.

1131
01:35:16,277 --> 01:35:16,948
Dude.

1132
01:35:18,746 --> 01:35:19,622
You get inside.

1133
01:35:20,081 --> 01:35:20,991
Open it dude.

1134
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:26,126
l will show you, scoundrel.

1135
01:35:36,831 --> 01:35:37,275
Lalu.

1136
01:37:32,346 --> 01:37:35,725
Kurudi was not immortal.

1137
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:41,292
Our journey was never one
with a clear objectives.

1138
01:37:43,090 --> 01:37:47,800
With each second passing by,
it was multiplying.

1139
01:37:50,264 --> 01:37:54,212
l avenged Kurudi's death even
before his blood stains got dried.

1140
01:38:33,374 --> 01:38:34,614
l have a son.

1141
01:40:02,629 --> 01:40:05,906
Hello sir, what is your take
on such a big raid?

1142
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,880
Since Soochikkottai had a
lot of grass plantations,

1143
01:40:10,037 --> 01:40:11,243
it was under strict police
observation since a long time.

1144
01:40:11,472 --> 01:40:13,042
Have you any idea
who and all is behind this?

1145
01:40:13,173 --> 01:40:14,618
Hello, stop, stop.

1146
01:40:18,278 --> 01:40:19,757
l will come and meet you later.

1147
01:40:19,847 --> 01:40:20,951
Fast, fast. Go.

1148
01:40:21,215 --> 01:40:21,693
Come on guys.

1149
01:40:23,317 --> 01:40:23,954
Come on.

1150
01:40:25,719 --> 01:40:26,823
What are you doing?

1151
01:40:27,121 --> 01:40:29,431
Before it burns completely,
pour water on it.

1152
01:40:31,358 --> 01:40:34,100
l was in a state of disillusionment.

1153
01:40:35,229 --> 01:40:41,874
Since l had surpassed Budhan,
l could see nobody when l looked up.

1154
01:40:42,469 --> 01:40:45,109
The empire Budhan had created
over a long 16 years...

1155
01:40:45,672 --> 01:40:48,653
...had become mine in one instant.

1156
01:40:49,576 --> 01:40:54,491
l was on the pinnacle of a
big mountain, which anyone...

1157
01:40:55,215 --> 01:40:57,456
...with a little valour and
luck could have easily climbed.

1158
01:40:57,584 --> 01:40:58,756
Your uncle came yesterday.

1159
01:40:59,286 --> 01:41:00,822
He wanted to make it happen soon.

1160
01:41:02,589 --> 01:41:04,933
What are you talking about mom?

1161
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:09,737
What else? lt's about you and Geethu.

1162
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:12,809
The astrologer had
informed us about an...

1163
01:41:12,933 --> 01:41:14,037
..auspicious day
in the beginning of the year.

1164
01:41:31,018 --> 01:41:41,618
Long ago... Long ago,
l hated you the most in my life.

1165
01:41:42,763 --> 01:41:46,404
But today, you mean everything to me.

1166
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,883
lt's not because you are
affluent or powerful.

1167
01:41:57,111 --> 01:41:59,489
l am ready to live with you
in any kind of hell.

1168
01:42:02,483 --> 01:42:05,896
All l want is your love till the end.

1169
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:27,612
Hari, you have a visitor.

1170
01:42:28,976 --> 01:42:30,455
You were talking about
an auspicious day right?

1171
01:42:30,911 --> 01:42:31,389
Yeah.

1172
01:42:37,384 --> 01:42:38,863
Hey, Sachi.

1173
01:42:40,554 --> 01:42:41,794
What brings you this way?

1174
01:42:42,956 --> 01:42:44,264
The new commissioner
has taken charge here.

1175
01:42:44,658 --> 01:42:45,636
Shouldn't we go meet him?

1176
01:42:46,326 --> 01:42:48,533
l will deliver his
due share through Sethu.

1177
01:42:49,129 --> 01:42:51,700
Not that, l heard he is really strict.

1178
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:53,770
lt will be nice if you
go meet him in person.

1179
01:42:55,068 --> 01:42:56,138
Okay, l will do that.

1180
01:42:57,471 --> 01:42:58,848
Okay then, let me go.

1181
01:42:59,106 --> 01:43:00,210
Have you eaten something?

1182
01:43:00,507 --> 01:43:01,508
No, l will go home and eat.

1183
01:43:01,775 --> 01:43:02,879
My wife and kids
will be waiting for me.

1184
01:43:03,110 --> 01:43:03,611
Okay.

1185
01:43:04,278 --> 01:43:04,779
Okay.

1186
01:43:06,079 --> 01:43:07,786
Hey Sachi, just a minute.

1187
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:14,021
Give this to your kids.

1188
01:43:14,955 --> 01:43:16,628
What's the matter?
You seem really happy.

1189
01:43:17,658 --> 01:43:19,729
You decided to marry her right?

1190
01:43:44,418 --> 01:43:45,158
ls the commissioner inside?

1191
01:43:45,452 --> 01:43:46,260
He is in a meeting.

1192
01:43:46,486 --> 01:43:47,294
You can wait upstairs.

1193
01:43:51,525 --> 01:43:52,230
Okay.

1194
01:44:47,781 --> 01:44:49,920
Our external affairs ministry
stated that...

1195
01:44:50,050 --> 01:44:51,996
...we will improve our
relationships with Pakistan.

1196
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:57,469
Today, the police force and
anti narcotics division raided...

1197
01:44:57,858 --> 01:45:01,601
...Soochikkottai and captured
almost 250 acres of hemp plant.

1198
01:45:05,232 --> 01:45:07,610
The police have arrested four
people with regard to this.

1199
01:45:07,901 --> 01:45:11,610
Abubakkar, Sethunath, Neerali alias
Jose and Lalu alias Harilal are...

1200
01:45:11,738 --> 01:45:13,012
...the ones who got arrested today.

1201
01:45:13,674 --> 01:45:16,052
The police have informed that
another three have escaped.

1202
01:45:16,777 --> 01:45:18,518
The Deputy General of Police
have informed us that...

1203
01:45:18,812 --> 01:45:19,950
...they are trying to catch them.

1204
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:21,650
Now a short break.

1205
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:03,594
Sachi, Sachi...

1206
01:46:15,502 --> 01:46:18,005
Bribery is the most crucial problem
we are facing in our department.

1207
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:23,617
l really hope you will keep your
spirits up till the end of your service.

1208
01:46:24,144 --> 01:46:26,590
Vishnu Budhan is the most
powerful drug dealer in town.

1209
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:29,893
l am sure you would have heard about his
influence in media and political forces.

1210
01:46:38,859 --> 01:46:40,736
lt won't be an easy job
to arrest him.

1211
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:44,133
We will get proper evidence sir.

1212
01:46:48,635 --> 01:46:50,308
lt is of no use by
gathering just evidence.

1213
01:46:50,737 --> 01:46:53,411
When he is gone,
another one will arise.

1214
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:56,514
So we must try to wipe out
all of it completely.

1215
01:47:01,114 --> 01:47:02,957
Don't approach Budhan directly.

1216
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:04,854
Use an undercover
operation for that.

1217
01:48:45,085 --> 01:48:46,291
My target was Budhan.

1218
01:48:47,287 --> 01:48:50,666
But since you started rising above him,
l started running behind you.

1219
01:48:52,792 --> 01:48:55,170
Now you will not be able
to come out so easily.

1220
01:48:55,428 --> 01:48:57,430
You can't sentence me
for death right?

1221
01:48:59,299 --> 01:49:00,972
Maximum a year or two.

1222
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:04,344
The court will take care of that.

1223
01:49:04,771 --> 01:49:10,119
Moreover we are smart enough to do
what is needed to keep you in forever.

1224
01:49:10,343 --> 01:49:13,085
Don't you have two daughters?

1225
01:49:15,916 --> 01:49:18,954
Lalu, l am getting married next month.

1226
01:49:19,452 --> 01:49:22,524
l will send the first invitation
card to the prison for you.

1227
01:49:28,828 --> 01:49:32,332
Lalu, aren't we still friends?

1228
01:49:33,833 --> 01:49:38,612
Having a single friend like you is
as equal to have a thousand enemies.

1229
01:49:40,774 --> 01:49:41,616
We will meet again.

1230
01:49:46,212 --> 01:49:49,523
Sachi could not get evidence
for the murders l did.

1231
01:49:50,684 --> 01:49:54,632
But for other crimes, the court
sentenced me for 5 years imprisonment.

1232
01:49:57,891 --> 01:49:58,596
Lalu...

1233
01:50:00,026 --> 01:50:00,868
Are you done?

1234
01:50:01,061 --> 01:50:02,768
Yeah. But l will be back.

1235
01:50:07,834 --> 01:50:10,212
Buddy, l am getting released today.

1236
01:50:17,110 --> 01:50:18,589
lt's not like what
Abu and Neerali had promised.

1237
01:50:19,412 --> 01:50:20,618
l will defnitely kill him.

1238
01:50:27,287 --> 01:50:31,099
My mind was getting older
with each passing day,

1239
01:50:32,926 --> 01:50:37,033
The first two years
felt like two generations.

1240
01:50:48,375 --> 01:50:50,480
lt's not because you are
affluent or powerful.

1241
01:50:52,278 --> 01:50:54,588
l am ready to live with you
in any kind of hell.

1242
01:50:55,115 --> 01:51:00,064
As always,
money is a woman's first lover.

1243
01:51:01,821 --> 01:51:03,459
Like father, like daughter.

1244
01:51:06,726 --> 01:51:10,071
There was neither a kingdom nor
a queen waiting back home for me.

1245
01:51:10,397 --> 01:51:14,641
All that vanished beyond my reach.

1246
01:51:22,942 --> 01:51:23,818
Mom.

1247
01:51:28,181 --> 01:51:30,024
l am sorry mom.

1248
01:51:32,052 --> 01:51:33,053
Will you do it again?

1249
01:51:37,824 --> 01:51:39,804
Oh dear, isn't it shameful
to cry being a boy?

1250
01:51:43,797 --> 01:51:44,901
Come back son.

1251
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:49,041
l will be there for you.

1252
01:51:49,202 --> 01:51:51,910
lt's okay sweety.
l am there for you right?

1253
01:51:53,206 --> 01:51:55,208
Don't do such things again.

1254
01:51:56,209 --> 01:51:57,654
Don't cry dear.

1255
01:51:58,611 --> 01:51:59,589
l will be waiting.

1256
01:52:04,851 --> 01:52:06,387
Wipe your tears Hari.

1257
01:52:07,754 --> 01:52:11,566
The rest of the three years
felt like three minutes.

1258
01:52:14,794 --> 01:52:16,364
Don't they know you will come today?

1259
01:52:17,630 --> 01:52:21,476
My mom doesn't know,
