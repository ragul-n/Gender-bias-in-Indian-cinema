1
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,104
"The King of Ayodhya, Lord Rama,
annihilated Ravana..."

2
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,358
"the Lord of the Demons and Lanka,
thousands of years ago"

3
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,694
With that came to an end the
rule of the demons...

4
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,030
and ushered in the present
fourth era of all time

5
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,908
"Even today, that victory
is celebrated..."

6
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,243
by setting Ravana on fire
during Ram Leela

7
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:23,333
The burning Ravana is a warning
to the human race:

8
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,503
"The demon is dead,
but he is not extinct"

9
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,506
"According to our Texts,
he will return"

10
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:34,260
"Like in every age, the return of the
demon even in our age, is inevitable"

11
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,931
Yala Lanka

12
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,518
"In the Ramayana, it is described
as a thriving city"

13
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,187
It was also Ravana's capital

14
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:50,068
The imposing statues still giving
you a feeling of his great powers

15
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:55,281
Because in this land lies buried
Ravana's seed of strength...

16
00:01:55,615 --> 00:02:00,203
the secret of his empire
and his rudraksh

17
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,747
Move it!

18
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,958
What the hell are you upto?

19
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,128
Get on with your work. Hurry!

20
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:14,300
"1990: For the first time in history,
a team of archeologists..."

21
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:19,139
arrived here in search of the truth
of that mighty rudraksh

22
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:25,979
Little did they know that Ravana's
rudraksh had chosen its first slave

23
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,982
Whose name was Bhuria

24
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,991
What's that?

25
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,337
Bhuria...

26
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,342
what did you put in your pocket?

27
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,685
Want to see more?

28
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,687
Come on... come!

29
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,596
I know what you're upto!
I'm not afraid of you!

30
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,307
You are thieves! Thieves!

31
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,394
I'm not afraid of you!
I'm not!

32
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,731
"Well done, Lali"

33
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,742
"Hey! Lay off, everyone!"

34
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,453
So many of you can't pull it!

35
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,802
And one night...

36
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:25,098
from the womb of earth emerged
the statue of the deity of the demons

37
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,893
"Thousands of years old,
from the times of the "Ramayana"

38
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,648
Which was buried after
the bloody war of Lanka

39
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,114
With the discovery of the statue...

40
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,700
there came to be a strange
transformation in Bhuria

41
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,747
He used to keep staring at the statue
in the darkness of the night

42
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:54,794
"And gradually, the statue began
showing him ways and secrets..."

43
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,173
that could lead Bhuria
to the hidden rudraksh

44
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,248
I understand

45
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,251
I can see it all

46
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:31,553
Sir! I knew this man was a thief!
She's a thief too!

47
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,055
That rudraksh belongs to me

48
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:38,018
"After thousands of years,
it's out today only for me"

49
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,145
You know why?

50
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:44,566
Because I am its rightful owner!
I!

51
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,735
"Not its rightful owner,
you are a thief!"

52
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,031
This is part of our culture
and history

53
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,786
"Watchman, don't let that man in.
Nor her"

54
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,876
This rudraksh... it's beautiful

55
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,045
It's mine

56
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,719
Mine

57
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,807
What have you done...?

58
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,476
You've killed?
It's okay

59
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:49,858
From here begins the strange story
of Bhuria and Ravana's rudraksh

60
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,819
The rudraksh's sole aim:

61
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,072
The restoration of the rule
of the demons all over the world

62
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:01,995
For that it was imperative to elevate
Bhuria from being a beastly human...

63
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,497
to turning a great demon

64
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,752
Years passed by in achieving
this goal

65
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,307
We have tolerated them enough!

66
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:29,105
Hurling stones will not do!
If you wish to achieve something...

67
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,858
pick up the sword
and hack them!

68
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,530
Wipe out all of them!
Not one must escape!

69
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,867
"If you want revenge,
it's time you did something!"

70
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,120
The shroud for martyrdom

71
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,372
Fight to the finish!

72
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:31,584
We can't put up with this mayhem!
We will avenge blood with blood!

73
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,378
Let's go!

74
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,933
What were you looking at?

75
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,310
What did you see?

76
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:13,168
"With his newfound powers, Bhuria had
also changed Lali's appearance"

77
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:18,048
All traces of Lanka had been erased
from her mind and psyche

78
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,633
And she started considering
herself to be...

79
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,304
a contract killer
for Mumbai's underworld

80
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,818
Bhuria was deep in meditation
to the rudraksh

81
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:43,239
"Gradually, he began hitting upon
new mantras..."

82
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,868
new evil powers and
newer conspiracies

83
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,082
"At 5 this evening.
Minerva Towers, Lokhandwala"

84
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,376
"He's belongs to the Company,
so watch out"

85
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,419
You'll get 10 grand for the job.
You agree?

86
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,339
"Speak up, Bhuria. You agree?
- Agreed"

87
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:02,676
Is that Lali? All right.
I'll have the photo sent

88
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,125
He's taking a shave.
He'll be out

89
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,465
Hey. Get that car moving

90
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:46,720
"Hey! I'll carve you apart!
Get lost, dog!"

91
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,729
Go and bump him off

92
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:05,739
Now!

93
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,544
Here you are.
Shoot!

94
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,546
"Shoot, I say!"

95
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,299
"What are you doing?
Shoot, I say!"

96
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,763
Lost your nerve?

97
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:52,118
He taught me something new today

98
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,039
Want to see?
- Sure

99
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,482
This is nothing. There's so much
more you got to see

100
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:27,320
But you remember nothing.
Nothing

101
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,406
"Oh no, what...
- Hush"

102
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:35,912
"Look in my eyes, Lali.
In my eyes"

103
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:30,884
When Lord Ravana's dreams
are realised...

104
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,887
when everyone in the world
turns a demon...

105
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,224
I will anoint you with
an iron crown like this one

106
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:42,270
I will first have it adorned

107
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:01,289
I have spent 14 years in exile
with this rudraksh

108
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,335
It has tormented me
so much...

109
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,253
but it has also taught me a lot

110
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,256
It's time your exile
came to an end

111
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:14,386
But I'm still incomplete

112
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,931
I haven't been able to acquire
all the powers of the rudraksh

113
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:22,018
"To be honest, I wasn't
worthy of it"

114
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,270
See

115
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,941
See!

116
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:30,318
It won't let me touch it even now

117
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,737
I desperately need a brother

118
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,950
A brother who will walk
with me as a fellow-demon

119
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:44,749
"Who has knowledge, power,
truth... selflessness"

120
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,963
"Come the time, he must lay all
his power at your feet..."

121
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,966
and sacrifice his own life.
Right?

122
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:57,429
"Lali, that's the norm
among the demons"

123
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:01,641
"Brother kills brother, oh yes"

124
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:43,076
"May you be happy.
I know, my child..."

125
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:46,788
"even after so many years,
you still have no child"

126
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:54,421
Do not worry. Here's an offering
made to Lord Shiva

127
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,768
Eleven days and nights
from today...

128
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:12,522
you will spend in meditation
to Lord Shiva

129
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,110
In the temple of Lord Shiva
here in our ashram

130
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:21,448
I shall be with you in
every ritual you offer

131
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,908
You will then see the miracle

132
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,119
"You are very kind, Swamiji"

133
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,747
Also please show my friends
the way

134
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,207
They need a miracle too

135
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:36,254
"Come here, my child. Here you are.
An offering made to Lord Shiva"

136
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:56,149
It has an electronic motor
to pump the ashes

137
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,152
Pick up the stuff.
We've got to get out of here

138
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,321
Go on. Return that to him

139
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,825
"At least hear me out, madam...
- You're a fake, mister"

140
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,162
A cheat. I haven't the time
to listen to anything else

141
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:13,166
"But madam... hear me out, please"

142
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,753
The world is full of impostors...

143
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,882
"who call themselves high priests,
godmen and gurus"

144
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:25,762
Separating the genuine ones from
this heap of fakes is very difficult

145
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,848
My team and I from the
University of California...

146
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:32,769
have toured the entire world
in search of that one man...

147
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:35,313
who will hopefully be genuine.
- Have you found him?

148
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:36,731
"Maybe, I have"

149
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:39,567
This man

150
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:41,986
His name is Varun

151
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:45,615
This woman suffers from arthritis.
She can't move her fingers

152
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,617
She's in agonising pain

153
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:56,209
Strange man. He speaks Sanskrit
and English too

154
00:22:56,543 --> 00:23:00,005
"He spends his days here and by night,
works as a bouncer at a bar"

155
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,549
He charges no money
for the treatment

156
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,219
But he has very long hair

157
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,806
"The frame of my camera captures
mostly his hair, not his face"

158
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:12,225
Here's proof of his genuineness

159
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,812
The wounds on the old woman's
hands begin to disappear...

160
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,231
and start showing on Varun's hands

161
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:27,574
How's your hand now?
- It doesn't hurt as much

162
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,242
Let's see

163
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,247
This kind man has taken away
my pain!

164
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:37,584
The patient was cured.
But what happened of Varun?

165
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:40,253
He collapsed out of pain

166
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:45,842
What a kind man!
He's an angel...

167
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:49,262
no one ever takes
another man's pain

168
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,975
I'm only concerned about the truth.
After much searching...

169
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:57,062
I've found a man who
possesses some powers

170
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:01,274
We've got to see how
far he goes

171
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:28,885
Hello

172
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,971
Hurry up. The teacher
arrived long ago

173
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:33,640
Teacher

174
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:34,367
How I cure them...?
I don't know

175
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:39,956
I see a patient and ask
Lord Hanuman...

176
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:43,793
"Why are You inflicting pain on him?
Give his suffering to me"

177
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:45,378
What?

178
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:47,839
Why not? Do I lack something?

179
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:51,051
The Lord has blessed me
with a body and soul

180
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:53,386
Can't I bear this much of pain?

181
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:56,181
"In a little while, the patient
is rid of his pain..."

182
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:58,725
and I remain suffering

183
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:03,730
Lord Hanuman is everyone's Lord.
But He loves me very much

184
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:06,399
He can't bear to see me
suffering for long

185
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:10,904
He comes and takes my pain away.
That's it then

186
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,407
They're all cured

187
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:18,620
"Are you speaking the truth, Varun?"

188
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:24,626
"When both your eyes are closed,
use the third eye"

189
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:32,217
Lord Shiva's vision.
The circle of the mind

190
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:36,429
Concentrate the powers of your eyes
to the third-eye

191
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:39,766
"In the darkness, you will begin
to see a strange light"

192
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:43,770
"No, you will still
not see anything..."

193
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,439
because it's only for the eyes to see

194
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,442
But you will get to know
everything soon

195
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:53,780
"Because it's for the circle of the mind
to get to know, without even seeing"

196
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:20,473
It's so difficult
to understand you

197
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:23,101
You take on people's suffering
and don't even accept any money

198
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:27,188
Nothing stirs
without money nowadays

199
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,482
What do you gain
by doing all this?

200
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:32,068
I've found a beautiful nymph
from America...

201
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:35,947
"who has a strange crush on me.
- Varun, be serious"

202
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,516
This is my small house

203
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:13,526
What's all this?

204
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,529
I'm a Brahmin. Also a priest

205
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:19,866
My father is the pontiff of
a hermitage in the Himalayas

206
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,535
For me to pray every day...

207
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:31,211
What is the rudraksh?

208
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:37,550
Rudraksh which means the
beads of Rudra (Lord Shiva)

209
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:40,220
A tear from Lord Shiva's eye

210
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:43,264
You don't even touch
a one-dimensioned rudraksh

211
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:45,308
It's only worshipped

212
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:48,269
Why? Will it bite
if I touch it?

213
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:50,980
If you are not worthy of it...

214
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:53,566
its powers could destroy you

215
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:55,735
How?

216
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:57,570
You ask too many questions

217
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:00,156
And you try very hard
to scare me

218
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:06,371
And I like you very much too.
Except one thing

219
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:10,166
You had very long hair

220
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,585
Hey! What have you done?

221
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:18,258
Love is godliness...

222
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:23,263
by God's design

223
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:44,617
Love is godliness...

224
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:47,620
by God's design

225
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:04,971
For those with crazed hearts...

226
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:08,641
Iove is a desire

227
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:11,811
It is fun...

228
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:15,440
Iove is succour

229
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:18,318
Love is the magic...

230
00:30:19,444 --> 00:30:21,988
that goes to your head

231
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:25,658
It is the fragrance...

232
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:29,662
that lingers in your being

233
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:33,333
Love is godliness...

234
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:36,670
by God's design

235
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:59,085
Those that love...

236
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:02,088
know what love is

237
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:06,343
Love...

238
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,095
heeds none

239
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:13,767
"Love is a promise,
love is a pledge..."

240
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:18,229
"love gives you the strength
to bear any sorrow"

241
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:22,108
The magic of love...

242
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:25,278
goes to your head

243
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:29,115
Let the fragrance of love...

244
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:33,453
linger in your being

245
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:36,581
Love is godliness...

246
00:32:37,582 --> 00:32:40,043
by God's design

247
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:06,319
Let the hues of love...

248
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,155
"lend colour to
your youthfulness"

249
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:16,162
"in love, our legend shall blossom"

250
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:21,209
"Love lends colour
to every moment..."

251
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:25,213
"love teaches you
the way to life"

252
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:29,300
Let the magic of love...

253
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,846
go to your head

254
00:33:34,014 --> 00:33:36,516
"Let the fragrance
of love..."

255
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:40,562
merge into your being

256
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:44,315
Love is godliness...

257
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:47,193
by God's design

258
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,587
Varun's brain-scan says that the
dark-cells in his brains...

259
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:51,257
"that have never been used before,
are being slowly activated"

260
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:25,542
Varun is right now in the condition
of a patient dying in hospital

261
00:35:26,751 --> 00:35:28,962
His B.P. And heart-rate
are all falling...

262
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:33,550
only the electro-magnetic field
is rising steadily

263
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,678
"But no, this man will not die"

264
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,973
He will awaken.
To a new light

265
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:43,351
This state is called the
samadhi in Yoga

266
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:46,312
Modern science hasn't yet
been able to understand it

267
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:01,327
His vital energies have
all been awakened

268
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:07,334
His energies have activated
the prostatic zone

269
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:35,362
"Unto You,
we submit, O Lord Ganesha"

270
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,714
No ordinary man uses his brain
more than one per cent

271
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:58,385
But Varun's brain is activated to
the extent of 70 per cent right now

272
00:37:23,576 --> 00:37:27,247
My university will give me as much
money as I ask for the research!

273
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:30,458
"Actually, I shouldn't have
been doing this"

274
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:34,421
"Had my father been here,
he'd have been angry with me"

275
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:36,715
How did you pull off the magic
with the can?

276
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:39,759
"God again! What is God
all about, after all?"

277
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:42,887
What is Suzy doing?

278
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:46,099
The file is being downloaded via
the wireless Internet

279
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,477
And where is the file?
- In some part of the world

280
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:54,107
"With the help of a password on Internet,
we can access any file in cyberspace"

281
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:58,445
God is like the Internet too.
A Divine Internet

282
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:04,909
"That connects every living being,
every animal and life in the world"

283
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:07,287
If the Internet exists
in the cyberspace...

284
00:38:07,537 --> 00:38:10,123
the Divine Internet encompasses
all realms

285
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:14,586
The Realm beyond time and space

286
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:18,131
That which Einstein gave the
name of the Quantum Domain

287
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:23,136
"Where past, present and future
are all alike"

288
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:27,474
There is nothing like far away
and near

289
00:38:28,725 --> 00:38:31,144
The Divine Realm is
God's playground

290
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:35,482
Where divine sport is
born every moment

291
00:38:35,857 --> 00:38:37,734
Where everything is possible

292
00:38:38,151 --> 00:38:39,944
Like I had that can lifted
in the air

293
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:42,155
"Similarly, I can get into
someone's bank-locker..."

294
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:45,158
and make away with the jewellery.
I can open the lock of someone's mind...

295
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:49,162
"and enter into it. I can even
play with his mind, if I wish to"

296
00:38:51,831 --> 00:38:56,169
But what if a thief or someone evil
got into your Quantum Domain?

297
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,713
It would spell doom

298
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:00,882
As it so often happened
in the bygone era

299
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:04,761
Such people are called demons.
- Oh come on. Demons!

300
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:06,763
They exist only in mythology!

301
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:13,353
What have I to do
in this asylum?

302
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:26,991
"Please leave us alone
for a while, doctor"

303
00:39:32,288 --> 00:39:33,456
C'mon

304
00:39:39,713 --> 00:39:42,549
"Varun, this experiment
is part of my research"

305
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:45,885
We've been studying this lunatic
for some days

306
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:51,224
This man's electro-magnetic radiation
is just like yours

307
00:39:51,641 --> 00:39:55,562
The only difference is that his
radiation is black and yours is white

308
00:39:56,229 --> 00:39:58,023
Take a look

309
00:40:00,316 --> 00:40:04,237
"If you could cure him, it would
make my research a success"

310
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:06,865
"lt'll awaken the whole world, Varun"

311
00:40:11,494 --> 00:40:14,789
"Come to your senses, Gayatri.
Before curing him..."

312
00:40:15,248 --> 00:40:17,250
I'll have to taken upon
myself his madness

313
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:21,254
So what's wrong? Lord Hanuman
is always there to protect you

314
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:23,923
I can't do it

315
00:40:24,257 --> 00:40:26,509
"Look, Mister!
I haven't come here..."

316
00:40:26,676 --> 00:40:29,262
with a huge team and spent millions
to watch your song and dance!

317
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:31,973
Do you also want money?
So tell me

318
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:37,520
"100,000? 200,000?
300,000...?"

319
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:49,402
For how long shall you remain
a prisoner?

320
00:42:55,658 --> 00:42:58,787
Do you forget? A whole new
world awaits you

321
00:43:00,497 --> 00:43:04,209
All it waits for
is a nod from you

322
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:05,919
No

323
00:43:06,169 --> 00:43:08,129
"You must understand it
at least now, Varun"

324
00:43:08,546 --> 00:43:11,132
They have tried to eliminate us
in every age

325
00:43:12,425 --> 00:43:16,012
"But in truth, no one has ever
been able to wipe us out"

326
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:26,231
I am the past and the future
of this universe

327
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:30,819
I am willing to share
my throne with you

328
00:43:31,444 --> 00:43:33,238
What else do you want?

329
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:36,449
"Just give me a sword,
so I can kill you"

330
00:43:41,454 --> 00:43:42,789
A sword...?

331
00:43:44,457 --> 00:43:47,460
Why one?
You may have two of them

332
00:44:11,484 --> 00:44:13,486
Now you're every bit my brother

333
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:15,061
"That was wonderful, Varun"

334
00:48:19,482 --> 00:48:22,235
Why're you following me?

335
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:25,739
You have no idea
who you are

336
00:48:26,281 --> 00:48:28,241
How deep you can go

337
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:31,745
So give up these worldly ties...

338
00:48:32,328 --> 00:48:34,414
and learn to fly like me

339
00:48:34,789 --> 00:48:37,083
"No, no..."

340
00:48:38,752 --> 00:48:42,005
"Try and understand, Varun.
My burden's too heavy to shoulder"

341
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:45,091
We have to shape
an entirely new world

342
00:48:45,842 --> 00:48:49,763
How will I be able to handle
such a momentous task on my own?

343
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:52,307
I'm on the look out for a brother...
- No...

344
00:48:52,432 --> 00:48:55,352
"and you are the brother, Varun.
I'm your brother, Varun"

345
00:48:55,769 --> 00:48:57,437
"Varun, I'm your brother!
- No!"

346
00:48:57,562 --> 00:48:58,980
I'm your brother!

347
00:48:59,189 --> 00:49:02,025
Don't ever leave me.
Don't... Varun!

348
00:49:26,174 --> 00:49:28,218
Where am I?
- This is our house

349
00:49:28,385 --> 00:49:30,804
You had passed out
so we brought you here

350
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:34,391
For how long?
- 2 days

351
00:49:34,808 --> 00:49:36,017
2 days?

352
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:40,814
But... what happened
of the patient?

353
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:43,817
His electro-magnetic field
has come down to normal

354
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:47,153
The folks in the hospital said
that he never used to go to sleep

355
00:49:47,362 --> 00:49:49,322
"And now, he's fast asleep"

356
00:49:49,906 --> 00:49:52,492
"Congratulations, Varun.
You have cured him"

357
00:49:52,826 --> 00:49:55,161
These are the words he
kept muttering for years

358
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:05,255
We think there's surely a connection
between his insanity and these words

359
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:09,009
"In fact, Dr Gayatri has started
a new experiment on him"

360
00:50:19,853 --> 00:50:24,357
Death occurring in riots across the
world is estimated at 850 lives

361
00:50:24,858 --> 00:50:28,862
"For the second day, riots continue
to rage in Asia's major cities"

362
00:50:29,362 --> 00:50:32,532
The Government today pressed its
security forces to control the riots...

363
00:50:36,327 --> 00:50:38,872
We're playing the madman's voice
to this mouse

364
00:50:39,956 --> 00:50:42,667
The voice has frozen the mouse

365
00:50:43,293 --> 00:50:45,670
It is undergoing a very
strange transformation

366
00:50:59,434 --> 00:51:01,394
"Suzy, it's looking at you"

367
00:51:11,905 --> 00:51:13,698
What's happening to you?

368
00:51:30,924 --> 00:51:33,259
There's a change in the
mouse's DNA molecule

369
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:35,261
It has undergone a
genetic mutation

370
00:51:35,428 --> 00:51:37,263
Which means it isn't
a mouse anymore...

371
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:39,599
it has become an animal
of another species!

372
00:51:39,933 --> 00:51:42,602
This is the first time something like
this has ever happened in an experiment

373
00:51:43,436 --> 00:51:46,523
I can now understand
why you and I have met

374
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,109
I'll tell you. I'm going
to win the Nobel Prize

375
00:51:49,317 --> 00:51:51,653
And so God has sent you to me.
So that I can conduct...

376
00:51:51,945 --> 00:51:53,947
an experiment like this one
and shake up the whole world

377
00:51:54,114 --> 00:51:54,989
Right?

378
00:51:55,198 --> 00:51:57,325
It's all happening because
we've got to stop him

379
00:53:57,654 --> 00:54:01,408
The distance between the world
and paradise is sometimes...

380
00:54:02,075 --> 00:54:04,077
just a step away

381
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:12,085
The mouse's genetic structure was
changed with just a voice

382
00:54:13,086 --> 00:54:15,422
"For you, however..."

383
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:18,091
just a gesture is enough

384
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:18,818
Hey Suzy...
where've you been?

385
00:56:44,779 --> 00:56:46,906
Why're you doing this...?
Why?

386
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,790
Who wants to put me to a test?
Tell me!

387
00:57:28,615 --> 00:57:29,991
Are you all right?

388
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:34,788
Where are you going?
- To stop him

389
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:47,634
"The police couldn't stop the riots
for the fourth successive day"

390
00:57:48,718 --> 00:57:52,305
"The list of those wounded has
touched 150 in Mumbai alone"

391
00:58:04,734 --> 00:58:07,570
Ms Gayatri is a citizen of the U.S.
You can't detain her

392
00:58:08,321 --> 00:58:11,700
"These are her papers.
- Okay, you can take her away"

393
00:58:12,325 --> 00:58:14,119
Please sign here

394
00:58:15,787 --> 00:58:17,789
I want to forget everything

395
00:58:18,331 --> 00:58:20,667
I want to remember anything of this

396
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:26,339
"You have a cure for everyone, Varun.
You must cure me today"

397
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:44,084
"What pain is this?
What thirst...?"

398
00:59:44,334 --> 00:59:49,589
I wish you wouldn't ask

399
00:59:52,592 --> 00:59:59,099
"When you do realise
what it is..."

400
00:59:59,516 --> 01:00:04,771
I wish you wouldn't ask

401
01:00:07,232 --> 01:00:11,861
A strange excitement...

402
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:17,117
"takes away from me
the control over myself"

403
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:24,457
"What pain is this?
What thirst...?"

404
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:29,713
I wish you wouldn't ask

405
01:00:30,505 --> 01:00:37,053
"When you do realise
what it is..."

406
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:42,809
I wish you wouldn't ask

407
01:01:15,884 --> 01:01:21,848
"Your pierce has
lent fragrance..."

408
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:31,775
to my warm breath

409
01:01:35,987 --> 01:01:40,533
"Never before has
anyone touched me like this..."

410
01:01:40,867 --> 01:01:46,706
"how will I tell you
what state I am in"

411
01:01:47,707 --> 01:01:52,545
My heart has been driven crazy...

412
01:01:53,213 --> 01:01:58,218
"it's the doing of
the spell you have cast"

413
01:01:59,094 --> 01:02:02,889
"What pain is this?
What thirst...?"

414
01:02:03,598 --> 01:02:07,143
I wish you wouldn't ask

415
01:02:09,145 --> 01:02:15,568
It's such a strange feeling...

416
01:02:15,985 --> 01:02:20,949
I wish you wouldn't ask

417
01:02:53,106 --> 01:02:54,399
The temple

418
01:03:26,014 --> 01:03:27,640
Namaskar.
- Namaskar

419
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:59,673
Let's go and see.
Where is this voice?

420
01:04:08,598 --> 01:04:10,684
Is this a mantra
of the occult?

421
01:04:11,935 --> 01:04:14,688
"No, it's the..."

422
01:04:15,605 --> 01:04:18,400
"It's a shadow. Isn't it father?
- Yes, it's a shadow"

423
01:04:20,443 --> 01:04:24,030
Where man keeps mumbling a few
chosen words again and again?

424
01:04:29,786 --> 01:04:32,872
The seed of the mantra is
first sown in the brains

425
01:04:33,873 --> 01:04:36,710
"And as he listens to it,
man begins to change"

426
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:39,421
To what extent he changes...

427
01:04:39,713 --> 01:04:43,717
depends on the man's weaknesses
or the power of the one who recites it

428
01:04:44,134 --> 01:04:46,970
"Which means, these voices
and this shadow...?"

429
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:50,515
Appear to be the rantings
of a madman

430
01:04:50,974 --> 01:04:53,977
But the seed of the mantra
is hidden in him

431
01:04:54,644 --> 01:04:56,980
Can the seed of the mantra
be removed then?

432
01:04:57,731 --> 01:04:58,732
No

433
01:04:59,065 --> 01:05:02,277
"If father makes the attempt, he'll have
to face the influence of the mantra"

434
01:05:02,819 --> 01:05:05,280
"Son, get father's ganyantra"

435
01:05:06,781 --> 01:05:07,991
Ganyantra?

436
01:05:12,746 --> 01:05:13,997
The ganayantra

437
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,921
"For several years, my father has
been trying to explain..."

438
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:25,342
the secrets of the mantras to people
through the computer

439
01:05:25,842 --> 01:05:28,762
I now understand why you
have such long hair

440
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:51,701
Found it!

441
01:05:58,792 --> 01:06:01,795
"You mustn't chant such a
wicked mantra, my child"

442
01:06:03,546 --> 01:06:10,303
"This mantra is surely not from the
Rig, Saam, Yajur or Atharva vedas"

443
01:06:10,804 --> 01:06:11,805
Then?

444
01:06:15,809 --> 01:06:18,603
Gayatri! He's my father!
- But I need to know

445
01:06:27,904 --> 01:06:30,115
The seed of the testament
of the demons

446
01:06:30,949 --> 01:06:34,828
I was right. As the Texts say...

447
01:06:35,537 --> 01:06:37,997
"several of the evil mantras
begin with "Rak"

448
01:06:39,624 --> 01:06:41,167
This is a mantra from there

449
01:06:41,376 --> 01:06:43,378
But what is the testament
of the demons?

450
01:06:43,628 --> 01:06:45,630
A demon free of the fear
of Indra...

451
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:47,632
adept at warfare and evil

452
01:06:47,924 --> 01:06:50,510
"Chand, Mund, Brashmasur,
Maheshasur..."

453
01:06:50,885 --> 01:06:52,637
they were all demons too...

454
01:06:52,846 --> 01:06:56,182
who derived their powers
from their own vedas

455
01:06:58,852 --> 01:07:02,230
"Towards the end of an aeon,
a bloody battle was fought..."

456
01:07:02,564 --> 01:07:05,859
in which the demons and their
philosophy were wiped out from earth

457
01:07:06,026 --> 01:07:09,571
"I don't know why, but thousands
of years later in another age..."

458
01:07:09,904 --> 01:07:12,282
the demons returned.
- You mean Ravana...?

459
01:07:14,576 --> 01:07:17,245
It is said that Ravana
prayed unto Lord Shiva...

460
01:07:17,579 --> 01:07:19,539
and got from Him a rudraksh

461
01:07:19,914 --> 01:07:24,252
Ravana placed the essence of
his philosophy in the rudraksh...

462
01:07:24,586 --> 01:07:26,588
and turned into it a seed of power

463
01:07:26,963 --> 01:07:31,092
Lord Rama vanquished Ravana.
So what happened of the rudraksh?

464
01:07:32,886 --> 01:07:36,222
It was believed that the rudraksh
was razed to ashes in Lanka

465
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:42,228
The demons were wiped out from the
face of earth. Am I correct?

466
01:07:42,812 --> 01:07:44,898
So how did he return to earth
in the form of Ravana?

467
01:07:47,317 --> 01:07:51,404
Ravana's rudraksh was razed to ashes
thousands of years ago. Correct?

468
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:53,907
So how can a mantra contained
in the rudraksh...

469
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,242
get into the mind of a madman
in Mumbai?

470
01:07:56,785 --> 01:08:00,497
"If the Texts are to be believed,
the demons can return anytime"

471
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:04,584
Because the demons are said to be
like the tail of a lizard

472
01:08:04,918 --> 01:08:06,920
"Cut it, and it'll grow"

473
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:09,297
"Cut it again, and it'll grow again"

474
01:08:09,631 --> 01:08:11,508
And you cut it
all over again...
