1
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:39,000
Hirak... what you've written makes sense …

2
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,917
… But we can't print this.

3
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,375
There's no evidence against them …

4
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:45,833
… They are political
leaders for God's sake!

5
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:48,542
- Have you read the full thing?
- Yes.

6
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:52,583
Mrinmoy cant we print it
without naming anyone?

7
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:57,375
How? Have I ever rejected
Hirak's articles before?

8
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:02,125
All I'm asking for is
some shred of evidence.

9
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,292
These are very serious charges …

10
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:07,083
… Against some very important
people in this city.

11
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:10,375
Hirak's source at the police
can't be named.

12
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:12,625
Our sources at the HQ!

13
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,833
Will anyone believe that?

14
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:17,583
Hirak? Are you listening?

15
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:20,667
Yea …

16
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:23,917
You give me the Shingur story.

17
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,625
Again the same sms.

18
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,667
This is the 6th time.

19
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:39,875
Listen …

20
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:43,458
This message is not for thee

21
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,208
So hurry and just send

22
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,208
Because my spirit in Kolkata

23
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,917
Cannot find a peaceful end

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,375
As heir to my Kingdom of Agradoot

25
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:01,042
My murder shall be avenged

26
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,833
By thy childhood friend.

27
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:08,500
Same unknown number.

28
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,875
Agradoot … the movie guys?

29
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:15,833
Yep.

30
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,792
- Agradoot Pictures.
- How do you know?

31
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,375
Childhood friend means Hemanta

32
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,333
His father was the
owner of the company

33
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,833
Committed suicide 3 years ago

34
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:39,417
Can't think of any other explanation!

35
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,208
Done what I told you?

36
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:44,417
Did you trace the number?

37
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,250
Forward this message …

38
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,083
Rather give your phone.

39
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,417
And forget my work?

40
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,333
But you're supposed to spend
the night at my place.

41
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,750
Ya. But I have to file a story

42
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,000
Will do that and then come.

43
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:19,250
Will you? Or go off to Shingur
for another story?

44
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,375
I'll come

45
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:30,125
Ok

46
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:38,500
Am ordering Chinese tonight.

47
00:04:41,042 --> 00:04:42,083
Tell me

48
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,125
Yea Hirak. Can hear you. Tell me.

49
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:47,750
Am coming tomorrow.

50
00:04:49,417 --> 00:04:50,458
Via Dubai

51
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,917
Via Dubai!!!

52
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,708
No I haven't called mom.
I'll call her from the airport.

53
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:04,375
Ya. She'll be fine

54
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:09,083
But listen, I can't understand
these messages

55
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,083
Who is sending them?
What they mean?

56
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:16,708
Some crazy asshole playing games?

57
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:23,250
No no … Hello? Hello Hirak?

58
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,583
Hey Marcus.

59
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,292
Tell me man.

60
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,583
I hear you Marcus … I hear you.

61
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,833
Marcus I know

62
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:49,625
Just hear me out.

63
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,167
I know what it means
for you for me …

64
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:54,917
… To get to direct a season of Psychopath.

65
00:05:57,292 --> 00:06:01,167
I know that actors like Jim Caviezel
and Woody Harrelson …

66
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:04,583
… Are not going to wait for me
to come from India.

67
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,250
But I gotta go.

68
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:12,333
There's something really important
happening out there…

69
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,583
Screw you Marcus I ain't doping.

70
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,208
Hello? Hello?

71
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,625
Time will tell time bears fruit

72
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:46,042
There's something rotten
in the state of Agradoot

73
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,792
Hurry home my son …

74
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:50,792
… Before it's late

75
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,417
It's only at home
your destiny awaits

76
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,833
The Artist's job is to play the role

77
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:46,917
Thy role is defined by thy goal

78
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,333
Prepare thyself with …

79
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,708
Prepare thyself with deep concern

80
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:11,042
Trust your childhood friend and none!

81
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:28,625
Welcome everyone, welcome!

82
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,958
So how do you feel?

83
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:35,333
This is my 5th film with Lalit …

84
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:36,833
4th?

85
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:38,167
No. 5th.

86
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:43,417
The 100 days of our film …

87
00:08:43,417 --> 00:08:45,833
Great co-actress …

88
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:48,583
Most importantly, the audience's
love and wishes has …

89
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,333
… Made this into a hit film.

90
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:56,292
We are indebted to the stars
as well as the technicians.

91
00:08:56,292 --> 00:08:58,208
- You Are a Bengali?
- Yup.

92
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,958
Why don't you make Bengali films?

93
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:03,333
Film is a universal medium.

94
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,292
It is our great pride that
our film Dhongsho …

95
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:11,000
… Has fought 3 big budget
Bollywood films …

96
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,833
… And is still at number 1 in Bengal.

97
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:19,083
Look, its commercial film and
good commercial film …

98
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,292
Makes the industry healthy.

99
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:23,083
But we should be careful
of dubious producers …

100
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,958
… Money laundering …

101
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:29,833
The man who literally pulled up
Agradoot pictures from …

102
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:33,875
… Bankruptsy and has given it
so much success,

103
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,958
One and only Kalyan Sen …

104
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,750
… And the biggest star
of Bengal, Gayatri Sen …

105
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,292
… Have tied the knot.

106
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:52,292
Gayatri is not only a star …

107
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,708
… But one of the trustees
Of Agradoot pictures.

108
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,000
After her husband,
the owner of Agradoot …

109
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,333
… Ananta Sen's death …

110
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,333
… She retired from films.

111
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,167
To her it was probably justified …

112
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:07,333
… But it was a big loss to the industry.

113
00:10:08,292 --> 00:10:12,167
The good news is, after
the marriage last night …

114
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:16,042
… She announced that
she will be acting again.

115
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:26,333
We are also very proud to have another
very important guest with today.

116
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,000
Ladies and gentleman …

117
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:31,958
The future owner and …

118
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:35,042
… The only son of Gayatri Sen
… Hemanta Sen!

119
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:43,000
Who has come all the way from
New York for this ceremony…

120
00:10:45,292 --> 00:10:50,000
Now I'd like to call our beloved
Kalyan to say a few words.

121
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:02,375
A lot has been said. So do enjoy
and kindly have dinner.

122
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:06,792
But Uncle I don't know Hindi.

123
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,542
You'll learn.

124
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:13,083
I'll tell Malhotra to give
you a Hindi instructor.

125
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:16,000
You still have a week for shoot. Go
to Mumbai and mug up your dialogues.

126
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:19,583
Uncle, at this peak of my career …

127
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,750
… I'll play villain in a Hindi film?

128
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,833
Any problem?

129
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,042
Dad please help me … say something.

130
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,042
I don't think we should argue.

131
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:55,583
I am not an amateur!

132
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,083
Got it?

133
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,500
I am getting into a deal with Malhotra.

134
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,250
You got to act in this film.

135
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,750
- But …
- Come on! Go…

136
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:34,958
Theatre owner of Barasat has come.

137
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,375
Remind him that if he
pulls off my movie …

138
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:40,917
… The theatre would be no more.

139
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:43,167
And tell the press to wait.

140
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,292
Come come Hemanta.
Jetlagged?

141
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,708
Someone said you wanted to see me.

142
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:08,292
So you've finally come home.

143
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,917
This empire, Agradoot is
finally yours Hemanta.

144
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,625
I'm just a trustee.

145
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:32,167
You are grumpy since
the time you came.

146
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:35,708
Your mother is getting hurt.

147
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,667
It's not her fault!

148
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:44,542
Whose … fault?

149
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,708
- Nobody's
- Right

150
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:52,708
After your dad's suicide
your mother …

151
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,667
… Was completely shattered.

152
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,875
She withdrew from everything.

153
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:07,167
- She never wanted to disturb you
- Yea. I know

154
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:14,583
Didn't know about your marriage.

155
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,667
You want her to stay
widowed forever?

156
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,542
So what do I call you
from tomorrow?

157
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,125
- Uncle or Daddy?
- Doesn't matter.

158
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,542
What matters is you see the truth.

159
00:14:48,042 --> 00:14:50,833
And the truth is …

160
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,542
… Copying South Indian
films to make money?

161
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,333
This film Dhongsho …

162
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,833
… What was the original title?
Interesting …

163
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:07,750
… I keep forgetting it.
What was it?

164
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,250
Rotting!

165
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:16,708
So there is something rotten
in the state of things.

166
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:23,917
If you literally mean the
State of Bengal then I'd say …

167
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,750
You haven't been to Bronx or Harlem.

168
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:34,083
Stayed only in the tony
places of New York.

169
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:40,583
And if by state you imply
remaking South Indian films

170
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,375
Then I'd remind you that when
Your Marty Scorsese

171
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:49,458
Cheats shot by shot from a Chinese film

172
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:55,000
And your America gives him
the Oscar for Departed.

173
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,417
Press is waiting.

174
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,542
I have to give a press statement.

175
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:06,708
And don't ever smoke grass
in my parties!

176
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,208
Vodka with coke!

177
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,083
Been looking for you for so long.

178
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:35,458
You've grown too tall.

179
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:42,125
- You sound like a …
- Know all. Intellectual?

180
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,042
Called you so many times,
couldn't get through.

181
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:52,750
Taken a new sim?

182
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,625
Ya. Picked one up at the airport.

183
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:02,333
How long are you going to be here?

184
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:03,792
Dunno. Why?

185
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,917
Can't tell you here.

186
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:09,417
Tell me.

187
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:15,792
The number where the sms are
coming from is untraceable.

188
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,917
I have a friend who is a hacker.

189
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,000
Hello!!!

190
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,083
Before coming 30 calls.

191
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,250
After you land not bothered at all.

192
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,792
Everyone's busy with the marriage.

193
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:36,375
Plus the movie's a big hit.

194
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,875
No photos please …

195
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,250
Come …

196
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,167
… Let me give you a hug.

197
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,792
Got to smell you after
so many years.

198
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:16,542
Conclusion …

199
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,083
Change the perfume.

200
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:24,875
That's it?

201
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,833
Come, let me introduce
you to some people.

202
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:30,833
Don't leave. Please.

203
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,708
What'll I do with a sweater?

204
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:44,792
- Am I going to Mumbai or Darjeeling?
- Sorry!

205
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:51,292
- If you're in a hurry I can pack myself.
- Why should I be in a hurry?

206
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:55,292
- Olly I know.
- What?

207
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,292
I know that like me
you have no choice.

208
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,333
Did he give you a call?

209
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:12,500
Did he write e-mails
from New York?

210
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:16,375
If he truly loved you …

211
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,542
He'd have tried to
contact you first.

212
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:23,458
He was abroad for so many years.

213
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,792
No one remembers what
happened in 7th grade.

214
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,083
Everything is not in our hands.

215
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:45,458
Do I want to go Mumbai
to play a negative role?

216
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,375
But I have to do it.

217
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:52,750
Cause Kalyan Sen has made me
what I am today.

218
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,292
Then be his lackey like dad.

219
00:19:56,292 --> 00:19:58,000
It's not a question of being a lackey.

220
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,583
It's reality.

221
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:10,000
And if you think you'll marry Hemanta.
You're being foolish.

222
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:13,667
Dad stop evesdropping. Come in
and say what you want.

223
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:25,125
Er... Sir Jackpot.. meaning your dad...
is in the studio since early morning.

224
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,292
Who are you?

225
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:33,500
I work under him in the
production department.

226
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,958
He told me that since
you'll be in Mumbai …

227
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:42,292
… I need to look after Olly madam.

228
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:44,083
I don't need to be looked after.
You can go.

229
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:52,083
Sir Jackpot, I mean your dad…

230
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,167
I don't need you. Go.

231
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,917
Dad'll never accept your
relationship with Hemanta.

232
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,958
He can't argue my case with uncle …

233
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,292
I love Hemanta.

234
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,500
No one can stop me.

235
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,917
Get it very clear.

236
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:26,333
Thy brother thy friend Hemanta

237
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,458
Guard him closely when
he reaches your shore

238
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,417
Trust no one but him …

239
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,500
… And him only

240
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:45,333
The seekers of truth are always lonely

241
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,583
The latest sms.

242
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:57,208
You were talking about a hacker friend.

243
00:21:59,292 --> 00:22:00,292
Yuri.

244
00:22:02,292 --> 00:22:03,667
Bengali Christian.

245
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,583
Very young. Computer expert.

246
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:15,583
He says that the number
doesn't exist.

247
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,625
As heir to my kingdom in Agradoot

248
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:21,958
If Agradoot is the kingdom then …

249
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,875
… I'm the king.

250
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:27,417
Because my father was the king.

251
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:32,833
Now I'm the legal heir
of Agradoot. The owner.

252
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:37,458
My murder shall be avenged by thee …

253
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,167
Meaning my father's murder!

254
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:45,500
Your dad committed suicide.
It's well known.

255
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:52,125
Are you sure?

256
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,125
Are you mad?

257
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:06,333
He was suffering from depression
for a long time.

258
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:10,333
Did you meet?

259
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,250
Yea.

260
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:22,750
He used to just live with
cell phone and computers.

261
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:28,625
Used to call me to sort
out computer glitches.

262
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:34,042
But finally he ended up
talking about you.

263
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,500
Who wrote his e-mails to me, you?

264
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,417
I just corrected them.

265
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,583
Want to smoke up?

266
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Do you?

267
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:07,750
I'm fine.

268
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:25,042
Your phone number.

269
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:41,333
9-8-6-3-4-1-0-1-8-2

270
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:57,042
That's my number.

271
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:08,750
We'll meet later.

272
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:13,333
Not here.

273
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:55,917
Hey … get up!

274
00:26:58,958 --> 00:27:03,000
- To office. Important meeting.
- Journalists attend meetings?

275
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:08,250
3 terrorist have been arrested
from a hotel on Wellesly Street.

276
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,750
Have to cover that.

277
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,917
Then lunch at Yuri's place.

278
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,917
Received another sms last night.

279
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:22,125
Have forwarded to you.
Will meet in the evening.

280
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:25,708
Sms … again?

281
00:28:21,292 --> 00:28:24,500
Hello … hello?

282
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:06,875
Hello … hello?

283
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,167
- Who?
- Dunno

284
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,375
Not working.

285
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:35,875
What a time to have a power cut!

286
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,250
Why didn't you call me home?

287
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:45,000
You don't have power cuts at home?

288
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:49,500
Not that …

289
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,417
Why secretly, right?

290
00:29:57,208 --> 00:29:58,583
Come on it's more fun.

291
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:00,917
Smoke up?

292
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,333
No.

293
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:04,583
You won't die!

294
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:06,833
Why're you being crazy?

295
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:09,542
You think I'm crazy?

296
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:14,167
Look, you come to Kolkata
and don't call me first.

297
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:16,958
Then you land up late
at night shit drunk.

298
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:20,208
Now we meet in a seedy hotel
and your phone rings constantly.

299
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:24,042
Firstly, that's not my home,
that's my dad's home.

300
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,958
Secondly …

301
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:30,167
… At home, we couldn't have
shared the same bed.

302
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:34,417
Do you want to make love only
after so many years?

303
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,208
Do you want to talk only,
after so many years?

304
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:40,833
Everything has its own time.

305
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:48,250
Ok. Let's talk.

306
00:31:03,917 --> 00:31:06,250
Talking about phone …

307
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:08,750
… Try to solve a riddle.

308
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:10,750
Let's play puzzles here.

309
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:20,750
Check this out.

310
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,375
One and two and no one saw

311
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,542
Jack with his Beretta in
his clothed claw

312
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:30,458
Betrayed by the queen
the king fell down

313
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:34,208
Will you pick up the task
or will you be a clown?

314
00:31:35,292 --> 00:31:36,792
- What?
- Going home.

315
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:39,875
Hey Olly! Hang on…

316
00:31:43,792 --> 00:31:45,375
Got you something.

317
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:51,750
This is for you.

318
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:59,708
Picked it up at the
airport, last minute.

319
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,000
Now what did I do wrong?

320
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:09,458
No she hasn't yet come out.

321
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:12,125
I've been updating you.

322
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,333
I mean …

323
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Excuse me.

324
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:20,583
Give me the phone.

325
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:22,375
Hello dad?

326
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:24,458
Why have you put
a spy on my trail?

327
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:27,083
At home... on the streets.

328
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:34,750
Listen … I've tolerated enough!

329
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,417
Listen …

330
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,958
… I'm an adult now
and I'm old enough!

331
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,667
And can't you trust your daughter?

332
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:45,042
What have you all started?

333
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:46,958
Hemanta's behaving insane.

334
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:48,042
Now, you too!

335
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:51,917
Please stop this … please. Ok?

336
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:01,417
The cyber crime branch called.

337
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:06,667
The number is untraceable.
Doesn't exist!

338
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:09,958
I told you!

339
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:14,417
But how's it possible?
I can see the text. See the number…

340
00:33:16,042 --> 00:33:18,542
There are computers …

341
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:21,708
… That can read your mind.

342
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:23,833
A I

343
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:26,042
Artificial Intelligence.

344
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:31,042
But not in our country.

345
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,000
All over world!

346
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:43,458
There are people who can read …

347
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,083
… Your mind by certain numbers.

348
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:52,667
Numerology.

349
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:57,458
Can read your horoscope
and tell you the future.

350
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:58,625
Astrology.

351
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:04,625
While meditating, can
rise above ground.

352
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:10,042
Levitation.

353
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,833
Everything has a scientific reason.

354
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:18,667
Really?

355
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:22,750
If there was only
reason in this world …

356
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:26,250
Would there have been
any mystery?

357
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,667
Man's job is to solve all mysteries.

358
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:37,542
Now you do your job
and let me do mine.

359
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:41,917
Work … off to Hemanta?

360
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:58,458
He's my only childhood friend.

361
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:05,667
Do you believe in Spiritual intelligence?

362
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,250
Soul?

363
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:17,000
A soul that gives a damn
to our social norms.

364
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:31,458
Gives a damn to our
middle class sentiments?

365
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:53,542
What a waste of knowledge!

366
00:35:55,792 --> 00:35:58,125
Wasted your dad's money
and became just a computer hacker!

367
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:01,667
Do you believe in the soul?

368
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:05,792
If there's proof I'll believe.

369
00:36:06,292 --> 00:36:11,708
So you have proof that I simply
wasted my dad's money?

370
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:16,958
Yuri, I didn't mean that.

371
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:21,167
What I meant was, you
could've achieved a lot.

372
00:36:23,917 --> 00:36:24,917
Am I wrong?

373
00:36:28,667 --> 00:36:30,500
Does it really matter?

374
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:38,250
Your 'just a computer hacker' …

375
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,458
Wants to give you fresh news.

376
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,500
On to drugs, again?

377
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:54,958
Leave it! Now see this.

378
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:59,375
Hacking randomly I
reached this site.

379
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:02,167
The name of the company is Help.com

380
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:03,792
Kolkata based company.

381
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:07,667
Does business with Bangladesh.
The business is not clear.

382
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:09,292
But look at this.

383
00:37:09,292 --> 00:37:12,667
Huge transactions. 85000 dollars …

384
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:16,125
66000… 72000 dollars …

385
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:19,083
And see this …

386
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:23,500
… Mention of Agradoot pictures
now and then.

387
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:31,375
Should I download these files to you?

388
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:42,583
Will meet in the evening.

389
00:37:54,958 --> 00:37:57,542
Don't you work under Mr Jackpot …
in film production?

390
00:37:59,042 --> 00:38:00,042
Why?

391
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:04,708
Did you have some work here?

392
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:07,542
Do you?

393
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:10,417
2 terrorists were arrested here.

394
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:12,667
Came to talk about it.

395
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:14,583
Then go. Talk.

396
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:22,833
One and two and no one saw.

397
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:26,250
Meaning only two people saw it.

398
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:30,292
Jack with a Beretta
in his clothed claw.

399
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:37,125
Clothed claw meaning
a hand that is covered.

400
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,208
Beretta obviously means a gun.

401
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:46,667
Betrayed by the queen
the king fell down.

402
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:51,583
Meaning the queen betrayed
so the king died.

403
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:52,917
Now who's this King?

404
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:57,667
The king to the kingdom of Agradoot.

405
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,750
Hemanta, I am trying to …

406
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,333
The owner of Agradoot is my father.

407
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:07,625
If dad's the King then …

408
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:12,625
… Queen is my mother …

409
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:14,833
… Gayatri Sen.

410
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:16,792
Hemanta!

411
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:19,417
Ratan there's nothing to clean there.

412
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:22,000
Go make a drink.

413
00:39:23,917 --> 00:39:25,750
I'll get you lemon tea.

414
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,292
He too doesn't give a damn.

415
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:30,458
I've been trying to
tell you something.

416
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:35,167
Yuri has hacked into an account.

417
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:38,583
Its called Help.com.
Huge transactions take place.

418
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:42,542
Agradoot is involved.

419
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:44,875
Queen mother!

420
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:47,667
Don't we call our queens mother?

421
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:53,208
Mother … Lady …

422
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,500
Lady you are cruel!

423
00:39:57,375 --> 00:40:00,083
Or, Lady you are frail.

424
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:04,208
Are you doped?

425
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:07,583
What's wrong …

426
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:13,333
Here. Look at this.

427
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:16,500
It's a 1936 made Beretta.
Belonged to may dad.

428
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:24,167
And what's this?
Clothed claw!

429
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:25,917
These gloves too
belonged to my dad.

430
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:30,458
It's pretty evident. Someone
wore these gloves and …

431
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:34,333
Killed my dad with this gun.

432
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:37,792
Then the gloves and gun
were put back here …

433
00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:39,583
… To give a feel
everything's in order.

434
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:43,000
Hemanta, uncle shot himself.

435
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:46,542
And that too in his own studio floor.

436
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:49,750
He lost his mind.
Everybody knows that.

437
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:51,917
You also believe in that? Really?

438
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,500
Are those sms simply lies?

439
00:40:57,333 --> 00:41:00,708
Those sms surely mean something.

440
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,917
It means only one thing.

441
00:41:05,292 --> 00:41:10,750
My mother… was also involved.

442
00:41:11,792 --> 00:41:12,792
And now …

443
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:18,458
… We are going to meet my mother.

444
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:20,875
Stop being a kid, man!

445
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:23,958
Kid man?! How can one be both?

446
00:41:24,292 --> 00:41:26,667
A kid can be a girl or a boy.

447
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:28,833
What am I? A boy or a man?

448
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:34,500
If I'm the son, then my job is to …

449
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,375
… Avenge his death.

450
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:38,375
And If I'm a man, then
what's my job?

451
00:41:38,792 --> 00:41:41,458
Your job is to make good films.

452
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:46,958
- Then what's Jack's job?
- Who?

453
00:41:48,167 --> 00:41:50,458
Who's Jack?

454
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:51,667
Who?

455
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:53,875
Jack of hearts!

456
00:41:56,292 --> 00:41:59,167
There's something rotten in
the state of Agradoot.

457
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:02,250
Let's go to our office … Driver!

458
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:03,333
Yes Sir!

459
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:04,875
Do you know the
distribution office?

460
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:05,958
Yes Sir!

461
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:07,750
Brilliant! Let's go!

462
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,458
Hemanta … for god's sake …

463
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:21,750
Hey … hey where are you going?

464
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,833
This is your office. You
gotta job here, right?

465
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,500
And you wanna say you don't know
about this help.com?

466
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,167
Pulakbabu knows about
it. I'm just a staff.

467
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:35,792
And I'm the goddam
owner of this place.

468
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:42,625
As the owner, I need to
know about help.com.

469
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:45,958
And as the owner
I'm ordering you …

470
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:48,167
… To turn on the computer
and show me …

471
00:42:48,167 --> 00:42:51,708
No … no more hanky panky.
Just turn the bloody thing on, will you?

472
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:55,167
- Sir I can't … my boss'll …
- Who's your boss?

473
00:42:55,167 --> 00:43:00,125
- Pulakbabu
- I know who he is…I'll talk to him

474
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:02,000
Who are you?

475
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,333
What the hell? Why are
you interrupting?

476
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:09,708
I'm the owner… you boss's boss …

477
00:43:11,917 --> 00:43:15,375
I'm Hemanta Sen.
I need to see what's in there …

478
00:44:02,708 --> 00:44:05,250
Hemanta needs a bodyguard.

479
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:10,333
Keep a close watch.
Update me constantly.

480
00:44:12,792 --> 00:44:14,833
He's upset.
Can be a nuisance.

481
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:19,875
Back from USA after a long time …

482
00:44:20,667 --> 00:44:22,625
Finding it hard to adjust.

483
00:44:22,917 --> 00:44:25,125
So he might do something crazy.
Prevent that.

484
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:44,167
Allow him to go anywhere
and do anything.

485
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:50,458
Madam

486
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:57,833
Yes Pulakbabu

487
00:44:59,208 --> 00:45:05,042
I mean er… Hemanta has met Oly

488
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:12,625
They secretly met at a
seedy hotel on Sudder Street

489
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:22,292
Oly was saying that
Hemanta is behaving strangely

490
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:23,792
He's not well

491
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:29,375
Not well?

492
00:45:30,042 --> 00:45:32,333
How can I put it…

493
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:35,083
According to Oly

494
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:37,917
Hemanta has fallen for her

495
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:40,208
Was acting crazy

496
00:45:42,625 --> 00:45:45,958
Actually Oly looks at him
like her brother

497
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,958
I mean she doesn't feel
the same way about Hemanta

498
00:45:54,667 --> 00:45:55,333
So…

499
00:45:55,375 --> 00:45:58,625
I thought of bringing it
to your notice

500
00:45:59,292 --> 00:46:01,625
Ok Pulakbabu…

501
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:05,625
I'll talk to Hemanta

502
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:10,917
If Olipriya doesn't want to
then I'll see to it

503
00:46:10,958 --> 00:46:13,375
That Hemanta withdraws

504
00:46:13,667 --> 00:46:16,708
Anyway he's going back
in a few days

505
00:46:17,125 --> 00:46:21,875
And regarding his health,
you needn't worry

506
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:25,875
I'll take care

507
00:46:30,042 --> 00:46:32,083
Ok madam

508
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:38,333
Call up and tell the production
I'll be late for tomorrow

509
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,042
Where are we going?

510
00:46:40,208 --> 00:46:41,500
Coffee

511
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:47,333
You go to a café?
Don't you get mobbed?

512
00:46:50,417 --> 00:46:52,625
People have forgotten me

513
00:46:53,875 --> 00:46:55,375
Time flies

514
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:00,625
You're in love with Olipriya?

515
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:04,958
Oh, so this about Oly and me,
not coffee!

516
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:09,292
Are you or not?

517
00:47:10,417 --> 00:47:12,917
Frailty thy name is woman

518
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:13,708
What?

519
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:19,292
Lady you are frail

520
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:26,583
Are you acting or really crazy?

521
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:29,542
Is there much difference
between the two?

522
00:47:29,583 --> 00:47:34,750
Look, if you don't like it here
go back to New York

523
00:47:34,792 --> 00:47:36,333
We want what's good for you

524
00:47:36,375 --> 00:47:37,750
Who's the We?

525
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:44,833
As a kid you use to
come here with us

526
00:47:46,042 --> 00:47:52,458
Me, you, your dad,
with our Sudebaker.

527
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,125
Remember?

528
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,333
And today instead of shooting
you bring me here

529
00:48:00,375 --> 00:48:02,750
To grill me… Time flies

530
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:13,583
Look, we… I want your happiness

531
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:20,042
So you're taking
Oly away from me

532
00:48:20,083 --> 00:48:21,500
First you asked me to stay back.

533
00:48:21,542 --> 00:48:23,292
Now you're telling me to go

534
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,292
Make up your mind

535
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:29,708
I waited for you to come and
take up your responsibilities

536
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:33,792
Waited darling

537
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,292
You're my only son

538
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:44,875
Do we look like that?

539
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,750
People who're watching us,
are they taking us

540
00:48:49,958 --> 00:48:52,042
To be mother and son?

541
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:54,042
Don't think so

542
00:48:54,458 --> 00:48:56,292
Let's make a condition

543
00:48:58,333 --> 00:48:59,792
I'll forget Oly

544
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:04,625
You leave uncle and come
live in dad's house

545
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:10,833
Come, who's better?

546
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:12,375
Me or Uncle?

547
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:23,708
I'm sorry
- I'm not

548
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:32,542
Look, if you think I've married
your uncle for money

549
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:34,625
You're wrong.

550
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,833
I don't want all this.
Take it back

551
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:41,708
After all you're the owner.
I'm just a trustee

552
00:49:43,542 --> 00:49:49,875
The word trustee has been
derived from trust

553
00:49:53,875 --> 00:49:54,875
Wait…

554
00:49:57,208 --> 00:49:59,625
You think I've
not executed my duties?

555
00:49:59,667 --> 00:50:01,542
I'm a traitor?

556
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:04,458
And to execute is to kill

557
00:50:14,417 --> 00:50:16,583
My car will drop you home

558
00:50:16,917 --> 00:50:18,542
I don't need a car.

559
00:50:19,792 --> 00:50:22,708
My car has been following me

560
00:50:23,417 --> 00:50:25,917
I've even got 2 bodyguards

561
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:30,667
Cause apparently
someone wants to kill me

562
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,667
You shoot. I take me leave

563
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,500
Adios Mother

564
00:50:56,167 --> 00:50:58,000
It's a lot of money

565
00:50:58,583 --> 00:51:01,042
Its saying help is an NGO

566
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:03,750
Gives loan to villagers

567
00:51:06,333 --> 00:51:07,667
What's going on?

568
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:11,792
But no record of loans

569
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,333
Money's coming from
abroad to Help

570
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:18,625
Then is being paid

571
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:24,750
To various hotels on
Sudder Street and Wellesley

572
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:28,917
Payment in cash.
Only cash

573
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:33,125
Big amount…
being collected and paid out?

574
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:38,042
Black money!

575
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:41,333
Money laundering!

576
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Money's being cleaned.
Black to white

577
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:50,375
But how's Agradoot
connected to this?

578
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:54,792
Much of it is put into films.

579
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:56,417
Money's being rolled…

580
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,792
Why don't you read the full thing?

581
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:06,708
How did you hack into it?

582
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,167
Won't say!

583
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:13,583
By accident.

584
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,167
The cell phone you gave
led me into it…

585
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:25,417
I'm downloading this ok?

586
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,583
I've ordered Italian

587
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:46,208
Will pizza do?

588
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:49,792
No. I have to leave tonight

589
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:02,333
Going to Hemanta?

590
00:53:04,542 --> 00:53:05,875
To Hemanta?

591
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:08,417
I've got to show him this

592
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:15,292
Last 3 nights you
kept me waiting and...

593
00:53:18,042 --> 00:53:21,750
Last three months I've telling you
to stop taking pills

594
00:53:21,792 --> 00:53:23,250
Are you bothered?

595
00:53:39,083 --> 00:53:41,292
Why create this drama

596
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:46,583
You're going to buy
again tomorrow

597
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,500
Go to Hemanta tomorrow

598
00:54:03,083 --> 00:54:05,833
Its important to give
him this pen drive

599
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,708
Its urgent

600
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:21,083
Where's the other one, Gupi?

601
00:55:21,125 --> 00:55:22,250
Where's Gupi?

602
00:55:25,417 --> 00:55:27,458
Gone to do a small job

603
00:55:32,542 --> 00:55:34,292
What's your full name Raju?

604
00:55:39,917 --> 00:55:41,667
Rajesh Sinha

605
00:55:41,958 --> 00:55:44,000
Been a bodyguard all along?
Great muscles

606
00:55:44,042 --> 00:55:45,000
No.

607
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,917
Wanted to be Rajesh Khanna the star

608
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,542
Couldn't crack acting.
Became a stuntman

609
00:55:54,292 --> 00:55:56,583
Now Kalyan babu's bodyguard

610
00:55:59,083 --> 00:56:01,250
Or are you James Bond?

611
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,417
What?

612
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:04,292
Spy?

613
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:05,625
Me?

614
00:56:06,792 --> 00:56:09,292
You're not spying on me?

615
00:56:10,542 --> 00:56:11,833
You can say that

616
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:16,250
Then let's hear who
appointed you? Mom?

617
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:23,792
Mom, Tom, Jerry…
can't say the name

618
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:25,000
Well then give me a light

619
00:56:25,042 --> 00:56:26,000
Can I smoke here?

620
00:56:26,042 --> 00:56:27,125
Yes sir

621
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:28,042
Thanks

622
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:36,125
Thank you

623
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:45,583
Rahul. Tow more…

624
00:56:47,542 --> 00:56:50,375
Since you're a spy...
Carry a gun?

625
00:56:54,083 --> 00:56:57,375
Was.
You just nicked it!

626
00:56:57,708 --> 00:57:00,042
Super! Super spy!

627
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,458
Mighty impressed

628
00:57:14,917 --> 00:57:15,708
Can I say something?

629
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:16,750
Sure

630
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,750
If I pay you double,
would you work for me?

631
00:57:24,667 --> 00:57:26,458
I'm working for you

632
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,417
Really?

633
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:30,292
First tell me this

634
00:57:31,542 --> 00:57:35,667
You've been in London
for so many years

635
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:38,125
How do you speak Bengali..

636
00:57:38,167 --> 00:57:40,667
America not London.
Correction

637
00:57:41,042 --> 00:57:42,500
Ya.. America…

638
00:57:44,542 --> 00:57:46,875
How do speak Bengali so well?

639
00:57:50,458 --> 00:57:53,000
Since a kid I lived with
my aunt in US

640
00:57:53,042 --> 00:57:55,917
They constantly taught me Bengali.

641
00:57:55,958 --> 00:57:58,083
Don't leak this.
Where's the loo?

642
00:57:58,125 --> 00:57:59,000
Out and right

643
00:57:59,042 --> 00:57:59,917
Thanks

644
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,125
Good day sir

645
00:58:29,208 --> 00:58:30,625
I've nothing to do

646
00:58:31,292 --> 00:58:33,667
I've been appointed by my client

647
00:58:34,042 --> 00:58:35,958
I have to go to court

648
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:42,167
But you can't win this case

649
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:44,542
There'll be pressure
from the top

650
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:48,167
Go tell whoever has sent you

651
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,542
I'll go to court tomorrow

652
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:53,417
There's a lot of
evidence against help

653
00:58:53,458 --> 00:58:56,375
And the police are also
willing to be witness

654
00:58:56,417 --> 00:58:58,625
A lot of black money
is changing hands...

655
00:58:58,667 --> 00:59:00,667
In seedy hotels
between Help and an...

656
00:59:00,708 --> 00:59:02,292
Illegal company in Bangladesh

657
00:59:02,333 --> 00:59:06,417
I'm a lawyear
my job is to fight for my client

658
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,917
So don't waste my time

659
00:59:09,167 --> 00:59:11,083
Get out of the car

660
00:59:41,833 --> 00:59:44,792
Couldn't you call and say,
you'll be late?

661
00:59:44,833 --> 00:59:46,667
Ya…Sorry

662
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:55,458
Whatever I've been telling you

663
00:59:58,458 --> 00:59:59,833
Whatever is happening…

664
00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:00,458
Er…

665
01:00:02,542 --> 01:00:05,417
makes no sense to you..

666
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:07,583
Its perfectly understandable

667
01:00:08,875 --> 01:00:11,708
These secret meetings…

668
01:00:21,917 --> 01:00:22,875
Hello…

669
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:24,833
Hello

670
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:30,333
Never mind..

671
01:00:34,792 --> 01:00:35,708
Ya…

672
01:00:37,417 --> 01:00:43,917
So you've told this
to your dad or…

673
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:49,792
God!!!

674
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,583
The matter is…

675
01:00:57,583 --> 01:01:00,917
I understand… your situation

676
01:01:01,417 --> 01:01:03,333
Not that I don't.
I do

677
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,167
But the matter is

678
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:11,417
There are certain things
happening or happened…

679
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:16,125
Which is very difficult to explain

680
01:01:16,167 --> 01:01:20,333
Either you switch of or
silence it or receive it…

681
01:01:25,167 --> 01:01:26,042
Hello…

682
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,792
Who the hell is this

683
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:52,042
You were saying something

684
01:02:02,167 --> 01:02:04,458
Don't you wanna say something?

685
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Have been trying to

686
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,583
Look you better switch it on

687
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:18,583
It'll be easy to talk

688
01:02:23,167 --> 01:02:29,667
You really want to know
why this phone is disturbing me?

689
01:02:29,708 --> 01:02:32,208
I'm not interested in your phone

690
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:35,708
I wanna know why you
came that night?

691
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:39,250
Why you meet me at
that hotel secretly? Why?

692
01:02:39,292 --> 01:02:42,208
Cause I wanna see you god damn it!

693
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:43,375
I wanna make love…

694
01:02:43,417 --> 01:02:46,167
Wanna spend time with you…

695
01:02:51,958 --> 01:02:52,875
That's all?

696
01:02:57,458 --> 01:02:58,833
No other plans?

697
01:02:59,458 --> 01:03:00,667
What plan?

698
01:03:12,583 --> 01:03:15,250
Don't you want to marry me?

699
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:20,333
Marry?

700
01:03:26,833 --> 01:03:29,833
There's a lot happening
all around us

701
01:03:34,708 --> 01:03:36,458
Every day, every minute

702
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:39,208
And all of them are
rather disturbing

703
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,958
Get that?

704
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:46,750
And you wanna turn
a blind eye to all of that?

705
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:50,833
Forget the world and get married?

706
01:03:53,792 --> 01:03:54,792
Really?

707
01:03:58,250 --> 01:03:59,708
You've changed so much

708
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:01,833
Why aren't you changing then?

709
01:04:03,042 --> 01:04:05,375
The whole world is changing!!!

710
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,500
Don't call me, ever!

711
01:04:25,292 --> 01:04:26,458
Pack up.

712
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:28,833
Let's go

713
01:04:31,917 --> 01:04:33,625
Super Spy…

714
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:49,375
Wow.
Whose house?

715
01:04:49,958 --> 01:04:51,750
Belonged to a maharaja

716
01:04:51,792 --> 01:04:54,375
Kalyan babu has bought it

717
01:04:54,417 --> 01:04:55,417
So, here?

718
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:59,458
You said you wanted to drink?

719
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,583
Awesome!!!

720
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,708
Won't last long

721
01:05:03,042 --> 01:05:04,958
It'll be burnt down by
an accidental fire

722
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,042
And a shopping mall
will be built here

723
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:14,583
I was never a traitor

724
01:05:18,625 --> 01:05:21,958
But couldn't keep my word

725
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I got only…

726
01:05:30,208 --> 01:05:31,750
Is your gun loaded?

727
01:05:31,792 --> 01:05:32,792
When?

728
01:05:34,625 --> 01:05:35,958
Now. Here.

729
01:05:37,292 --> 01:05:41,833
The gun that you're carrying...
Has bullets?

730
01:05:42,083 --> 01:05:42,750
Yes

731
01:05:42,792 --> 01:05:43,792
Great.

732
01:05:47,917 --> 01:05:51,250
Have you ever played
Russian Roulette?

733
01:05:51,875 --> 01:05:54,000
Seen Russian Circus

734
01:05:54,708 --> 01:05:55,792
Super.

735
01:05:56,583 --> 01:05:58,583
But have played Russian Roulette?

736
01:05:59,167 --> 01:06:00,875
What is it?

737
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:04,125
Game.

738
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:07,542
Gambling of sorts

739
01:06:10,292 --> 01:06:11,625
A gun.

740
01:06:13,042 --> 01:06:17,500
All the bullets will be
taken out except one

741
01:06:18,625 --> 01:06:21,667
We'll take the gun in turns

742
01:06:21,708 --> 01:06:24,333
Point it at our heads.
Here

743
01:06:25,917 --> 01:06:27,042
And shoot

744
01:06:28,667 --> 01:06:30,583
If it doesn't fire you live

745
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:33,583
If it does you're out!
Gone for ever

746
01:06:34,792 --> 01:06:36,167
Are you game?

747
01:06:38,083 --> 01:06:39,125
Agreed?

748
01:06:40,042 --> 01:06:42,458
Stop the drums. Play?

749
01:06:51,042 --> 01:06:52,625
- Loaded.
- Ooooo

750
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:57,958
Gupi, my pal

751
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,250
Take out the bullets…
Just keep one

752
01:07:00,292 --> 01:07:01,292
Don't forget

753
01:07:14,667 --> 01:07:15,958
Fantastic

754
01:07:21,417 --> 01:07:23,792
Shoot… shoot

755
01:07:32,875 --> 01:07:33,750
Wha…

756
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:45,292
Blanks?!!!

757
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:47,583
Movie bullets!

758
01:07:48,125 --> 01:07:50,542
Right! Movie bullets.

759
01:07:52,208 --> 01:07:55,042
So you are movie spies?

760
01:07:58,417 --> 01:08:01,042
You'll make a movie?

761
01:08:03,292 --> 01:08:06,042
Rajesh Sinha wants to be
Rajesh Khanna the star?

762
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:10,125
Any role. Any part.
I can do it.

763
01:08:10,708 --> 01:08:11,708
Sure…

764
01:08:13,708 --> 01:08:16,833
But the problem is the role

765
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,250
That's the main problem

766
01:08:21,792 --> 01:08:26,958
Without a bullet a gun
is useless, right?

767
01:08:30,667 --> 01:08:31,750
So,

768
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:36,958
without a role an actor
is bloody useless

769
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:44,708
Like me, I've learnt
so much in New York

770
01:08:45,958 --> 01:08:48,000
But I'm fucking useless

771
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:49,792
Why?

772
01:08:50,083 --> 01:08:50,708
Why?

773
01:08:52,958 --> 01:08:54,417
No role
- Exactly

774
01:08:59,708 --> 01:09:03,583
So you're not gonna make a movie

775
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:07,042
I will.

776
01:09:08,125 --> 01:09:09,167
I will…

777
01:09:11,208 --> 01:09:13,292
Movies have to be made

778
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,167
In fact will start the shoot
in a few days

779
01:09:21,625 --> 01:09:23,208
But no copies.

780
01:09:23,542 --> 01:09:24,958
No Tamil. No Telegu

781
01:09:25,417 --> 01:09:26,583
Original

782
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:31,667
They'll be action?

783
01:09:32,833 --> 01:09:35,333
Full on. Only action.

784
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:38,500
In fact will start with
the climax scene

785
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:40,333
That's my man!!!

786
01:09:42,708 --> 01:09:45,000
So what do have to do?

787
01:09:49,042 --> 01:09:50,125
Will tell you

788
01:09:51,917 --> 01:09:52,958
But first

789
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:53,833
Tell me

790
01:10:03,083 --> 01:10:04,042
What's this?

791
01:10:06,083 --> 01:10:07,000
Jack?

792
01:10:10,292 --> 01:10:11,667
Jack of Hearts?

793
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:13,958
Jack!!!

794
01:10:16,417 --> 01:10:17,292
What?

795
01:10:17,958 --> 01:10:19,083
Nothing…

796
01:10:21,042 --> 01:10:22,167
Jack!

797
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:49,042
Hemanta can't accept our marriage
He's shocked

798
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,083
Getting crazy

799
01:11:06,667 --> 01:11:09,208
He's driving Oly nuts

800
01:11:10,458 --> 01:11:15,000
Let's separate and
let them live happily

801
01:11:22,917 --> 01:11:25,417
You'll be able to accept?

802
01:11:25,458 --> 01:11:26,250
No.

803
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,458
But if we're forced to part then

804
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,667
This time I'll commit suicide

805
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:42,875
Why are you reminding
me of the past?

806
01:11:43,667 --> 01:11:48,708
Cause that was the
best time of my life

807
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:51,458
The past.

808
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,958
Secretly going to brother's house

809
01:12:01,208 --> 01:12:06,833
Just brushing my hand against yours

810
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:13,875
Just watching you

811
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:23,458
You came to the studio with brother
wearing your shades

812
01:12:25,958 --> 01:12:28,958
I watched you from a distance

813
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:34,333
Those days were the
most important days of my life

814
01:12:36,042 --> 01:12:37,917
Just watching you

815
01:12:38,917 --> 01:12:44,458
Never imagined I'll take
so much responsibility

816
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:53,750
Hemanta wants to make a film

817
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:56,000
Let him

818
01:12:56,042 --> 01:12:59,750
Working will help him get focused

819
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:03,042
And after all its his company

820
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:08,750
Right?

821
01:13:11,833 --> 01:13:14,667
Let him make the film.

822
01:13:16,042 --> 01:13:17,167
Please

823
01:13:19,792 --> 01:13:22,708
I'm turning in.
Have shoot tomorrow

824
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:37,833
To the spirits!

825
01:13:38,125 --> 01:13:40,250
May they rest in peace

826
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:42,917
So?

827
01:13:43,667 --> 01:13:48,417
Er… Kalyan sir said to manage
whatever you need for your film

828
01:13:54,083 --> 01:13:55,792
So, you're the Manager?

829
01:13:56,458 --> 01:13:59,500
Actually Pulakbabu is the Manager

830
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,292
I just organize
whatever is required…

831
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:09,875
So you're the Organizer?

832
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:14,625
The expenses.

833
01:14:15,583 --> 01:14:17,875
Pulakbabu is the Production Controller

834
01:14:17,917 --> 01:14:21,625
I work under him… help him out

835
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:29,250
Help?

836
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:37,417
So, lets's talk about your company
called help.com

837
01:14:38,625 --> 01:14:39,250
I'll come later

838
01:14:39,292 --> 01:14:40,500
Just a sec!

839
01:14:43,917 --> 01:14:46,875
Later will become very fishy…

840
01:14:47,042 --> 01:14:47,500
Fish?

841
01:14:48,167 --> 01:14:52,000
Yup. You're the fishmonger
Deal with fish right?

842
01:14:52,042 --> 01:14:53,417
Which fish is rotten…

843
01:14:53,458 --> 01:14:54,750
Which the Bengalis love…

844
01:14:54,792 --> 01:14:56,250
Which the audience will buy?

845
01:14:58,042 --> 01:15:00,792
Pomphret? Illish?… Cod fish?

846
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:06,542
I just wanted to hear
the story of the…

847
01:15:06,583 --> 01:15:08,375
Words, words, words…

848
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:13,500
Only sounds. No meaning.
No story

849
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:16,958
Take the call

850
01:15:17,542 --> 01:15:19,875
Someone wants to buy fish…

851
01:15:27,792 --> 01:15:30,125
Yes sir.
I'm in his house

852
01:15:30,958 --> 01:15:32,625
Guess he's drunk

853
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:34,958
Talking about spirits

854
01:15:35,375 --> 01:15:37,375
About Cod fish, Pomphret…

855
01:15:43,292 --> 01:15:46,333
Yes I have tried.

856
01:15:46,958 --> 01:15:49,750
I keep wanting to know the details

857
01:15:51,208 --> 01:15:53,125
He's saying only sound…

858
01:15:53,167 --> 01:15:55,000
He needs a sound recordist only…

859
01:15:56,875 --> 01:15:59,917
Ok Sir Jackpot…
I'll call you later

860
01:16:02,292 --> 01:16:04,250
Who called?

861
01:16:04,667 --> 01:16:05,667
Pulakbabu

862
01:16:05,958 --> 01:16:07,917
His pet name is Jackpot

863
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:13,250
Your dad called him Jackpot
Cause he was your dad's lucky mascot…

864
01:16:13,292 --> 01:16:15,833
Since then we all call him that

865
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:23,458
So you are the Jack of Jackpot

866
01:16:24,792 --> 01:16:28,208
Do you know whether
Jackpot has gloves?

867
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:32,792
I'll come later
- No

868
01:16:34,958 --> 01:16:39,458
Dealing with fish you have to
fall in the net sometime

869
01:16:40,625 --> 01:16:41,500
Tell me

870
01:16:43,125 --> 01:16:44,500
What's this?

871
01:16:45,458 --> 01:16:46,125
Card

872
01:16:46,167 --> 01:16:47,333
In the card?

873
01:16:48,375 --> 01:16:49,417
Jack

874
01:16:49,458 --> 01:16:50,375
Right

875
01:16:53,167 --> 01:16:57,417
So tell your Jackpot to
hire a camera, that's all

876
01:16:58,667 --> 01:17:01,542
All else will be take care by Raju

877
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:02,458
Raju?

878
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:06,167
Your hired spy

879
01:17:36,958 --> 01:17:39,667
Scene 48 by 1. Take 1

880
01:17:40,792 --> 01:17:41,958
Action

881
01:17:43,167 --> 01:17:47,417
Gargi called and asked
me to meet here

882
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:48,625
Yes

883
01:17:49,875 --> 01:17:52,750
Look Mr Anadi Sen,
your father was a

884
01:17:53,667 --> 01:17:58,667
Legenday film producer

885
01:18:00,125 --> 01:18:03,542
A milestone in history
of Bengali cinema

886
01:18:05,292 --> 01:18:09,875
But right now your
situation is very grim

887
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:18,708
Bollywood and TV
has destroyed your market

888
01:18:20,708 --> 01:18:23,792
All your single screens

889
01:18:24,208 --> 01:18:27,125
Specially the ones in the villages

890
01:18:27,333 --> 01:18:29,708
Are like graveyards

891
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,083
And in the cities Bengalis
are least interested in

892
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:35,500
Bengali cinema

893
01:18:36,375 --> 01:18:38,833
Your production house…

894
01:18:39,208 --> 01:18:40,583
Agragami…

895
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:43,042
Its moribund

896
01:18:46,375 --> 01:18:54,375
Me and your wife have told you
To take Save.com seriously

897
01:18:55,833 --> 01:18:58,000
Why can't to understand

898
01:18:58,042 --> 01:19:00,083
Money will flow… Cash

899
01:19:00,125 --> 01:19:02,125
We need money right?

900
01:19:02,417 --> 01:19:03,042
Cut it!

901
01:19:04,292 --> 01:19:06,000
Rakesh, we got a problem here

902
01:19:06,042 --> 01:19:08,375
By this time the camera
needs to come on the gloves

903
01:19:08,417 --> 01:19:09,042
Ok

904
01:19:12,375 --> 01:19:15,333
Where are the god damn gloves?!

905
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:16,750
Sir…
- Shut up.

906
01:19:17,292 --> 01:19:19,458
Can't do a single thing!

907
01:19:19,625 --> 01:19:21,625
Ruju go give the gloves
- Here

908
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,917
Production.
Tea please

909
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:40,208
See, you gotta pull this then
Shoot. Got it?

910
01:19:41,833 --> 01:19:43,250
Alright Actors

911
01:19:44,167 --> 01:19:45,875
We gotta take this from the top

912
01:19:45,917 --> 01:19:46,833
Again? God!

913
01:19:50,458 --> 01:19:51,833
You're good?

914
01:19:55,292 --> 01:19:57,000
Ok? Right?

915
01:19:59,208 --> 01:20:00,125
Sound speed.

916
01:20:00,167 --> 01:20:01,625
Shit what do you say?

917
01:20:01,667 --> 01:20:02,917
Roll sound, right?

918
01:20:02,958 --> 01:20:03,792
Rolling

919
01:20:05,458 --> 01:20:06,833
You'll live long

920
01:20:06,875 --> 01:20:08,000
Camera

921
01:20:13,417 --> 01:20:14,292
Rolling

922
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:18,792
And action

923
01:20:23,583 --> 01:20:25,917
Look Mr Anadin Sen, your father

924
01:20:26,583 --> 01:20:34,583
Was a very successful film producer
A milestone of our Bengali film industry

925
01:20:35,375 --> 01:20:39,625
But now your company
is on the downhill

926
01:20:40,625 --> 01:20:45,833
Bollywood and TV has
ruined your market

927
01:20:46,833 --> 01:20:49,292
Your single screens,

928
01:20:49,708 --> 01:20:51,833
Specially in the villages

929
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:53,708
Are like graveyards

930
01:20:54,042 --> 01:20:55,625
If you continue this way

931
01:20:55,667 --> 01:20:56,875
You'll be gone

932
01:20:56,917 --> 01:20:59,375
I and your wife have
been telling you

933
01:20:59,417 --> 01:21:01,083
To take save.com seriously

934
01:21:01,125 --> 01:21:04,000
It will get you funds, money
You need money, right?

935
01:21:04,042 --> 01:21:07,167
I wont get into money laundering

936
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:10,792
Who's sending cash from abroad?

937
01:21:10,833 --> 01:21:15,083
What they're doing with this money
I no nothing

938
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:18,333
What does it matter?

939
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:24,708
We'll just create
an NGO organization

940
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,208
Money'll flow in

941
01:21:28,042 --> 01:21:33,167
We'll just say were trying
to help the poor

942
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:35,333
We just wont do it

943
01:21:35,375 --> 01:21:38,833
We'll just have some fake records.
That's it

944
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,333
We'll use that money to improve
our single screens

945
01:21:45,833 --> 01:21:47,875
We'll invest in films

946
01:21:47,917 --> 01:21:52,667
Right.
And our company will again grow

947
01:21:53,625 --> 01:21:57,708
But why are they sending
the money through us?

948
01:21:57,750 --> 01:21:59,875
What's it to you?

949
01:22:00,417 --> 01:22:02,542
Everyday so much
shit happens in the world

950
01:22:02,583 --> 01:22:04,125
The twin towers collapsed

951
01:22:04,167 --> 01:22:07,125
Prostitution, drugs, kidnapping

952
01:22:07,333 --> 01:22:10,000
Does it matter what we think?

953
01:22:10,042 --> 01:22:14,875
And even if we do,
will the world change?

954
01:22:17,458 --> 01:22:19,708
Why're you wearing
gloves in this heat?

955
01:22:19,875 --> 01:22:22,458
Cut it. Got that. Next shot

956
01:22:23,667 --> 01:22:26,167
Rakesh we need to get
the girl in now

957
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:27,167
Gupi!

958
01:22:30,542 --> 01:22:32,125
Go get the actress…

959
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:32,958
Yes sir

960
01:22:36,333 --> 01:22:39,333
You got your lines right?

961
01:22:40,292 --> 01:22:40,917
Silence!

962
01:22:42,833 --> 01:22:45,042
You know your dialogues?

963
01:22:45,083 --> 01:22:45,750
Yes

964
01:22:45,958 --> 01:22:49,375
Ok. Lets roll.
But we need to change the lens

965
01:22:51,292 --> 01:22:54,083
Is it mineral water?
Doesn't matter… thanks

966
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:02,500
A little tighter please

967
01:23:02,833 --> 01:23:04,167
Get the 85

968
01:23:04,458 --> 01:23:06,542
Let me know when you're ready

969
01:23:06,583 --> 01:23:07,625
Ready sir

970
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:10,375
Ya we are ready

971
01:23:13,625 --> 01:23:14,583
Roll sound

972
01:23:16,542 --> 01:23:17,667
Roll camera

973
01:23:21,333 --> 01:23:23,125
And action

974
01:23:23,875 --> 01:23:26,417
Why're you wearing gloves Jack?

975
01:23:27,042 --> 01:23:30,083
Gargi?
What are you doing here?

976
01:23:31,292 --> 01:23:32,708
Here, sign this

977
01:23:35,083 --> 01:23:37,292
Or else you'll kill me?

978
01:23:38,542 --> 01:23:41,875
And you gave him my pistol?

979
01:23:44,583 --> 01:23:49,333
Don't force me to shoot.
Sign this paper

980
01:23:50,917 --> 01:23:53,750
My son will avenge my death

981
01:23:53,792 --> 01:23:57,208
You'll call him in London?
After death?

982
01:23:57,583 --> 01:23:58,667
Sign I said

983
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:02,708
My son will take revenge

984
01:24:04,667 --> 01:24:06,167
Hey… she's fainted

985
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:08,750
Get some water

986
01:24:09,583 --> 01:24:11,792
Stop this circus!
Stop it!

987
01:24:23,917 --> 01:24:25,458
Bring the script to my office

988
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:26,458
I need to read it

989
01:24:28,292 --> 01:24:31,292
And as long I am the trustee
of the company

990
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:34,417
No shooting without my orders

991
01:24:37,333 --> 01:24:38,250
Pack up!!!

992
01:24:41,292 --> 01:24:44,667
Betrayed by the queen
the king fell down

993
01:24:45,708 --> 01:24:49,292
Will take up the task
or will you be a clown?

994
01:24:51,458 --> 01:24:52,542
Pack up

995
01:24:56,917 --> 01:24:58,208
Sorry I'm late

996
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:01,458
New Empire theatre caught fire…
short circuit

997
01:25:01,708 --> 01:25:03,625
What're you doing with a gun?

998
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:08,583
It was set to fire right?
What?

999
01:25:11,542 --> 01:25:13,500
If the theatre burns down then the

1000
01:25:13,542 --> 01:25:15,917
Hassle of shutting down,
sacking workers…

1001
01:25:15,958 --> 01:25:17,042
Won't be required.

1002
01:25:17,083 --> 01:25:20,333
Remove the garbage and
build a shopping mall…

1003
01:25:20,375 --> 01:25:21,667
It maybe your assumption

1004
01:25:21,708 --> 01:25:23,542
One can't print news on assumption

1005
01:25:23,583 --> 01:25:26,292
What's assumption and
what's the truth?

1006
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:31,250
You tell me?

1007
01:25:33,625 --> 01:25:37,125
You're making a movie
based on a few sms

1008
01:25:39,958 --> 01:25:42,958
Cause you think your uncle
will get rattled

1009
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,417
And confess that he's
killed your dad

1010
01:25:45,458 --> 01:25:46,875
I need a proof.
That's all

1011
01:25:46,917 --> 01:25:48,000
Proof of what?

1012
01:25:48,042 --> 01:25:50,333
That my uncle has
murdered my dad

1013
01:25:50,375 --> 01:25:51,875
And mom's involved

1014
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,583
And what'll you do?

1015
01:25:55,833 --> 01:25:58,417
Kill your mom and uncle?

1016
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:01,375
Why not?

1017
01:26:05,875 --> 01:26:07,458
Are you in your sense?

1018
01:26:09,708 --> 01:26:11,917
Are you in your senses?

1019
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:14,875
A man has swindled
my dad's company

1020
01:26:14,917 --> 01:26:15,917
And is cheating

1021
01:26:15,958 --> 01:26:17,542
And I'll accept?

1022
01:26:18,292 --> 01:26:20,458
How can you?

1023
01:26:21,417 --> 01:26:23,583
Thy brother,
thy friend is Hemanta

1024
01:26:23,625 --> 01:26:26,208
Guard him closely when he
reaches your shores

1025
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:28,458
Is this is what's happening?

1026
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,292
You too got the sms

1027
01:26:30,333 --> 01:26:31,917
What're you doing?

1028
01:26:35,917 --> 01:26:39,250
Bunking office.
And downloading facts of that

1029
01:26:39,292 --> 01:26:40,625
Lousy dirty company

1030
01:26:40,667 --> 01:26:42,250
Not creating a drama

1031
01:26:42,292 --> 01:26:43,625
What'll I do with that?

1032
01:26:43,667 --> 01:26:45,417
If you really wanna fight

1033
01:26:45,458 --> 01:26:46,958
Get a lawyear.
Got to court

1034
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,292
Court?
Don't make me laugh

1035
01:26:50,708 --> 01:26:55,250
He buys politicians.
You know that

1036
01:26:56,167 --> 01:26:59,083
I stay back, fight for years

1037
01:26:59,250 --> 01:27:00,708
You think I'll win in the end?

1038
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:02,958
This is a democracy

1039
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,417
Democracy?!!

1040
01:27:07,042 --> 01:27:10,292
Rajeev Gandhi went to trial.
Even President Nixon!

1041
01:27:10,917 --> 01:27:13,500
This democracy you're talking about

1042
01:27:13,542 --> 01:27:18,333
Does a communist hunt
during HUAC by Macarthy

1043
01:27:18,375 --> 01:27:23,792
They drop the Napam in Vietnam
in the name of democracy

1044
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:30,042
They create an Osama
an kill an Osama

1045
01:27:30,083 --> 01:27:33,625
And back home, back here,
they declare President's Rule

1046
01:27:33,667 --> 01:27:35,083
In the name of peace

1047
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:36,625
Democracy my ass!!!

1048
01:27:37,583 --> 01:27:39,000
Are you talking of Jihad?

1049
01:27:39,042 --> 01:27:42,167
No I'm taking about my uncle
who killed my dad

1050
01:27:42,292 --> 01:27:44,000
This is assumption

1051
01:27:44,625 --> 01:27:47,500
If you really wanna fight
file a case

1052
01:27:47,667 --> 01:27:49,458
Of corruption and
money laundering

1053
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:50,292
You get it?

1054
01:27:50,333 --> 01:27:51,458
Or else?

1055
01:27:52,625 --> 01:27:54,583
Go back to New York

1056
01:27:55,542 --> 01:27:59,000
Cause your craziness
is getting us nowhere

1057
01:27:59,208 --> 01:28:01,208
You don't have to get anywhere

1058
01:28:02,917 --> 01:28:04,625
My father was murdered.
Not yours

1059
01:28:04,667 --> 01:28:05,917
You obviously don't care

1060
01:28:05,958 --> 01:28:07,917
And thy brother thy friend…

1061
01:28:07,958 --> 01:28:10,500
Whatever that is,
you don't need to guard me

1062
01:28:10,542 --> 01:28:12,917
I have enough bodyguards

1063
01:28:18,208 --> 01:28:20,292
Your dad was my dad too

1064
01:28:20,333 --> 01:28:23,292
After my dad died, he raised me

1065
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:26,833
You went off.

1066
01:28:29,583 --> 01:28:32,458
I was with him till the last

1067
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:34,583
Don't you ever forget that

1068
01:28:36,083 --> 01:28:37,167
And yes,

1069
01:28:40,417 --> 01:28:43,708
those last e mails were
not written by him

1070
01:28:43,750 --> 01:28:45,833
I wrote them for him

1071
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:17,417
Hey Gupi and Raju, come in

1072
01:29:20,792 --> 01:29:22,375
Need to talk

1073
01:29:23,958 --> 01:29:25,833
Sit, need to talk

1074
01:29:31,875 --> 01:29:33,000
Thanks I just…

1075
01:30:38,792 --> 01:30:40,167
Give me the gun

1076
01:30:42,583 --> 01:30:45,708
You can't be a killer.
Give me the gun

1077
01:30:48,875 --> 01:30:51,042
You're an artist Hemanta,

1078
01:30:52,917 --> 01:30:54,667
not a killer

1079
01:30:56,333 --> 01:30:59,625
I'm fixing an appointment with

1080
01:30:59,708 --> 01:31:01,583
A shrink, who's a friend

1081
01:31:01,708 --> 01:31:03,333
Get your head checked

1082
01:31:08,208 --> 01:31:12,708
You can't accept our marriage

1083
01:31:15,083 --> 01:31:17,583
I can't help it

1084
01:31:18,333 --> 01:31:21,333
I love your mother

1085
01:31:22,750 --> 01:31:25,208
Much more than your dad

1086
01:31:26,333 --> 01:31:29,208
You can't digest that
and are acting crazy

1087
01:31:32,333 --> 01:31:34,958
I take it as mental disturbance

1088
01:31:36,917 --> 01:31:38,833
But if you think...

1089
01:31:40,958 --> 01:31:42,542
I killed your dad

1090
01:31:43,333 --> 01:31:45,167
And took over,

1091
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:52,042
Your mistaken
And I won't accept stupid mistakes

1092
01:31:54,875 --> 01:31:58,542
Neither will I allow you to
disturb your mom

1093
01:31:58,792 --> 01:31:59,792
Understand?

1094
01:32:00,125 --> 01:32:04,333
I agree I produce lousy remakes

1095
01:32:08,958 --> 01:32:13,167
Have evaded tax to keep
the company going

1096
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:15,208
Every businessman does

1097
01:32:16,417 --> 01:32:22,417
But if you make villain
out of me and act crazy

1098
01:32:24,958 --> 01:32:27,167
I wont accept

1099
01:32:29,417 --> 01:32:33,042
Your mother isn't well

1100
01:32:34,458 --> 01:32:37,250
She had a stroke

1101
01:32:37,458 --> 01:32:39,917
Doctors have ordered
total bed rest

1102
01:32:40,250 --> 01:32:40,958
So,

1103
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:44,417
stop this idiocy

1104
01:32:44,542 --> 01:32:46,458
Or I'll have to…

1105
01:32:54,458 --> 01:32:55,417
Sir…

1106
01:32:56,125 --> 01:32:57,000
I mean

1107
01:32:57,042 --> 01:33:00,292
Hemanta will go home
Take him there

1108
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:06,667
Hey, come on, lets go

1109
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:35,792
This is Yuri

1110
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:39,583
You're not receiving my calls

1111
01:33:41,167 --> 01:33:43,375
Not replying to my sms

1112
01:33:45,792 --> 01:33:47,958
I know you're busy

1113
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:55,833
But I'm not…

1114
01:33:55,958 --> 01:33:58,167
Disturbing you for myself

1115
01:34:04,125 --> 01:34:06,792
Its for your Hemanta

1116
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,875
I've hacked some new mails

1117
01:34:12,917 --> 01:34:16,042
Through that help.com

1118
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:18,708
Help is involved with

1119
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:20,375
Some very dangerous things

1120
01:34:20,417 --> 01:34:22,125
I just want to let you know that

1121
01:34:22,167 --> 01:34:25,333
That's it
Help is sending a lot of money

1122
01:34:29,458 --> 01:34:33,208
To some newly founded Madrasa

1123
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:37,250
A lot of money

1124
01:34:37,958 --> 01:34:40,000
But these Madrasa...

1125
01:34:42,833 --> 01:34:44,500
are not legitimate

1126
01:34:44,833 --> 01:34:46,917
Not real Madrasa.

1127
01:34:46,958 --> 01:34:49,167
They are fake schools

1128
01:34:57,167 --> 01:34:59,333
They are actually
terrorist camps

1129
01:34:59,958 --> 01:35:02,375
Terrorist training camps

1130
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:04,708
Do you get it? Hirak?

1131
01:35:05,542 --> 01:35:08,125
A mail has come saying that

1132
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:12,375
Money has to be sent
to a guy called Yakub

1133
01:35:15,375 --> 01:35:17,375
Who's holed up in a
hotel on Wellesly Street

1134
01:35:17,417 --> 01:35:20,958
This guy is connected
to Mumbai blasts

1135
01:35:21,875 --> 01:35:26,500
Look, meeting me may not
be important

1136
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,958
To you anymore
But these information is important or not?

1137
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,750
As a journalist?!!

1138
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:43,292
Come.

1139
01:35:44,167 --> 01:35:47,417
Get coffee for sir

1140
01:35:49,958 --> 01:35:51,375
And also for me

1141
01:35:51,417 --> 01:35:53,542
You were told no coffee mam

1142
01:35:53,583 --> 01:35:54,875
Get it

1143
01:36:06,125 --> 01:36:08,042
When did you return
from hospital?

1144
01:36:10,083 --> 01:36:11,042
Sit…

1145
01:36:13,833 --> 01:36:14,958
Today

1146
01:36:15,792 --> 01:36:19,208
You should've stayed
there a bit longer

1147
01:36:23,417 --> 01:36:30,000
You should've
not done what you did

1148
01:36:43,917 --> 01:36:50,208
You not only hurt me
but your father too

1149
01:36:55,042 --> 01:37:03,042
And if I say you have
hurt my father and your husband too?

1150
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:08,458
Stop this smart talk

1151
01:37:11,042 --> 01:37:13,958
It'll take us nowhere

1152
01:37:14,542 --> 01:37:16,667
Then you stop lying

1153
01:37:16,708 --> 01:37:20,750
Cause that'll take us
nowhere too

1154
01:37:21,917 --> 01:37:25,750
How you've changed

1155
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,083
Totally changed

1156
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:33,958
Come… Come

1157
01:37:35,458 --> 01:37:37,208
See in the mirror

1158
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:39,750
Look at yourself… Just look

1159
01:37:39,875 --> 01:37:41,667
See, how much
youve changed my queen

1160
01:37:41,708 --> 01:37:42,500
Look!!!

1161
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,500
Its hurting

1162
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,208
Its hurting me too

1163
01:37:51,583 --> 01:37:54,458
Its been aching me
for a long time

1164
01:37:54,708 --> 01:37:57,042
Think. Two brothers.

1165
01:37:59,458 --> 01:38:02,375
One tried to struggle, honestly

1166
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:09,292
The other took to dishonesty,
short cut

1167
01:38:09,625 --> 01:38:13,250
And being a queen,
whom did you choose?

1168
01:38:13,917 --> 01:38:14,958
What the hell?

1169
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,708
I know physical desires
are important

1170
01:38:17,750 --> 01:38:19,750
The body is important…
Lust is important

1171
01:38:19,792 --> 01:38:22,208
But you chose dishonesty
for your lust?

1172
01:38:24,667 --> 01:38:28,250
Yes I chose Kalyan
for physical desire

1173
01:38:29,583 --> 01:38:31,167
I'm flesh and blood

1174
01:38:31,208 --> 01:38:33,125
Not a wooden doll

1175
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,167
Don't you know how young
I was when I got married?

1176
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:41,167
Tour dad never saw me as a girl

1177
01:38:41,208 --> 01:38:44,583
I became a mother
at the peak of my career

1178
01:38:52,083 --> 01:38:55,083
Every business has ups and downs

1179
01:38:55,708 --> 01:38:58,792
But will a man forget his wife?

1180
01:38:59,542 --> 01:39:02,500
Day in day out I slept separately

1181
01:39:05,375 --> 01:39:07,708
I lost my youth….

1182
01:39:09,917 --> 01:39:11,833
I lost my youth

1183
01:39:14,208 --> 01:39:19,250
Your dad lived with his
cellphone, laptop, computer

1184
01:39:19,375 --> 01:39:21,875
He became a machine,
a computer chip

1185
01:39:21,917 --> 01:39:23,667
Got my point?

1186
01:39:28,417 --> 01:39:31,667
I couldn't live with a machine

1187
01:39:32,417 --> 01:39:35,542
No I couldn't live
with a computer

1188
01:39:35,583 --> 01:39:37,292
I'm a normal woman

1189
01:39:39,833 --> 01:39:41,458
I have physical desires

1190
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:50,500
I couldn't live with a machine

1191
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,625
Its come again. Message

1192
01:40:04,875 --> 01:40:07,167
And this time in Bengali

1193
01:40:09,208 --> 01:40:10,583
Listen to this

1194
01:40:12,292 --> 01:40:15,917
Lies beget more lies

1195
01:40:16,542 --> 01:40:20,167
Lies will lead to the end

1196
01:40:21,208 --> 01:40:23,917
No use of reason anymore

1197
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:32,750
The only option is revenge

1198
01:40:32,958 --> 01:40:34,667
Why in Bengali?

1199
01:40:35,167 --> 01:40:38,083
Cause you can
understand more clearly

1200
01:40:42,208 --> 01:40:43,542
Hemanta,

1201
01:40:45,417 --> 01:40:48,250
you've gone completely mad

1202
01:40:48,833 --> 01:40:50,250
Totally crazy

1203
01:40:50,292 --> 01:40:52,125
Didn't you kill Dad?

1204
01:40:53,333 --> 01:40:57,458
Kill?
I Killed your dad?!!!

1205
01:40:57,708 --> 01:41:00,500
How did his gun
go the studio floor?

1206
01:41:00,542 --> 01:41:04,083
He always kept the gun with him

1207
01:41:04,125 --> 01:41:06,083
You didn't steal it?

1208
01:41:18,708 --> 01:41:21,500
I can't take it anymore…

1209
01:41:22,833 --> 01:41:24,750
Not anymore…

1210
01:41:28,958 --> 01:41:30,125
Do this.

1211
01:41:31,167 --> 01:41:34,500
Stop this dirty company called Help

1212
01:41:35,833 --> 01:41:37,417
Divorce my uncle

1213
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,583
Come over to the next house

1214
01:41:39,625 --> 01:41:40,917
My house

1215
01:41:42,167 --> 01:41:44,167
My father's house

1216
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:48,833
Will you?

1217
01:41:50,083 --> 01:41:51,667
Will you? Please…

1218
01:42:50,833 --> 01:42:52,750
Has Pulak's car come?

1219
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:53,917
Yes

1220
01:42:57,833 --> 01:42:58,792
Gupi…

1221
01:43:00,083 --> 01:43:04,167
Both of you put the
deadbody in the dickie

1222
01:43:05,333 --> 01:43:08,167
Then drive to a lonely highway

1223
01:43:09,917 --> 01:43:11,667
Wait till 10.30

1224
01:43:14,958 --> 01:43:16,250
Then…

1225
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:21,208
Turn the car and burn it

1226
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:28,583
Before burning,
pour a lot of whiskey

1227
01:43:28,625 --> 01:43:30,083
All over the body
and in the car.

1228
01:43:30,125 --> 01:43:31,083
Got it?

1229
01:43:34,292 --> 01:43:36,958
Keep me updated
on my other number

1230
01:43:41,208 --> 01:43:42,083
Raju,

1231
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:45,375
no matter how late

1232
01:43:45,958 --> 01:43:49,292
You have to take Hemanta
to our empty mansion

1233
01:43:49,625 --> 01:43:51,625
He shouldn't escape.

1234
01:43:52,083 --> 01:43:54,792
Wait for my next order

1235
01:43:56,292 --> 01:43:57,958
And if he escapes…

1236
01:44:00,583 --> 01:44:02,375
It'll take me 2 mts...

1237
01:44:02,417 --> 01:44:06,250
to dig up your old cases
and dump you in jail…

1238
01:44:06,292 --> 01:44:07,625
Got it?

1239
01:44:38,292 --> 01:44:41,000
Go to Hemanta's house.

1240
01:44:41,667 --> 01:44:43,500
Spy on him

1241
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,542
Who's coming.
What they're saying…

1242
01:44:51,625 --> 01:44:54,958
I'll call you on your
private number sir.

1243
01:45:23,917 --> 01:45:25,542
Enough Kalyan.

1244
01:45:28,417 --> 01:45:31,417
I won't accept anymore.

1245
01:45:32,208 --> 01:45:34,417
Its time you call the cops

1246
01:45:37,208 --> 01:45:38,917
Hand over Hemanta?

1247
01:45:39,833 --> 01:45:42,917
You've any idea
what'll happen to the company?

1248
01:45:45,042 --> 01:45:47,208
He's the owner of the company

1249
01:45:52,417 --> 01:45:54,125
Take your medicines Go to bed

1250
01:45:56,208 --> 01:46:01,042
I think you should listen to
what I'm saying

1251
01:46:03,667 --> 01:46:07,750
Take your medines.
Don't sleep in the bedroom

1252
01:46:07,917 --> 01:46:10,625
Move to the guest room.
Nurse!

1253
01:46:19,167 --> 01:46:21,542
It's a problem with you males

1254
01:46:22,958 --> 01:46:27,667
The moment you disagree
you decide to sleep separately

1255
01:46:29,792 --> 01:46:31,792
Your brother did the same

1256
01:46:33,083 --> 01:46:34,792
You're crossing your limit

1257
01:46:35,667 --> 01:46:37,750
Hey… Hold on…

1258
01:46:39,292 --> 01:46:40,958
I havn't finished

1259
01:46:41,208 --> 01:46:42,833
I'm a trustee too

1260
01:46:44,667 --> 01:46:46,833
A bad thing happened,
we hushed it up

1261
01:46:46,875 --> 01:46:51,000
Another has happened and
I'll have to lie again

1262
01:46:57,458 --> 01:46:59,250
This must stop.

1263
01:47:02,792 --> 01:47:05,667
On one hand Hemanta is getting crazy

1264
01:47:06,375 --> 01:47:11,083
On the other you're getting nastier

1265
01:47:12,083 --> 01:47:13,917
Get one thing clear

1266
01:47:14,417 --> 01:47:17,750
I will not support any
more illegal activities

1267
01:47:22,333 --> 01:47:24,833
Ok? I'm out from now on

1268
01:47:26,250 --> 01:47:28,417
Can you hear me clearly?

1269
01:47:42,625 --> 01:47:44,042
Here drink this

1270
01:48:19,625 --> 01:48:22,167
You think you can
avoid this so easily?

1271
01:48:26,875 --> 01:48:30,125
Stop all arguments by
coming upstairs?

1272
01:48:30,708 --> 01:48:32,208
Bloody Coward!

1273
01:48:36,958 --> 01:48:40,750
I'm not your marionette, got it?

1274
01:48:42,667 --> 01:48:44,333
This scotch that
you're drinking,

1275
01:48:44,375 --> 01:48:46,500
That you're ruling…
it cause of me

1276
01:48:46,542 --> 01:48:47,375
Only for me

1277
01:48:51,458 --> 01:48:56,375
If you're so concerned about justice
then you call the cops

1278
01:48:56,417 --> 01:48:59,458
Cause the murder happened
in your room

1279
01:49:03,917 --> 01:49:05,542
Stop being childish

1280
01:49:05,875 --> 01:49:08,583
Suddenly you choose
Hemanta's side…

1281
01:49:10,917 --> 01:49:14,667
Out. Get out from my house…
Out!

1282
01:49:25,583 --> 01:49:29,542
Guess you're forgetting
this is my house

1283
01:49:31,250 --> 01:49:33,167
Yours is next door

1284
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,417
Anyway,

1285
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,542
I'm used to sleep in hotels.

1286
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:50,583
Good night

1287
01:50:03,292 --> 01:50:04,500
Hemanta,

1288
01:50:05,750 --> 01:50:07,792
can't find my dad

1289
01:50:08,083 --> 01:50:10,333
I've looked everywhere

1290
01:50:10,625 --> 01:50:13,167
Left in the morning
without his car

1291
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:17,125
Now his car too has vanished

1292
01:50:17,167 --> 01:50:18,375
I'm really afraid

1293
01:50:20,292 --> 01:50:23,500
Take sleeping pills
and go to sleep

1294
01:50:23,542 --> 01:50:24,500
What?

1295
01:50:27,042 --> 01:50:29,583
Once you sleep
you'll forget your fear

1296
01:50:30,042 --> 01:50:31,750
Why're you talking like this?

1297
01:50:31,792 --> 01:50:33,458
How should I be talking?

1298
01:50:37,250 --> 01:50:39,625
Dad said he had work with madam

1299
01:50:39,667 --> 01:50:41,542
Then he was supposed to meet you

1300
01:50:41,708 --> 01:50:43,750
I can't find him

1301
01:50:43,792 --> 01:50:45,708
And you don't care?

1302
01:50:48,292 --> 01:50:50,542
To care and not to care?

1303
01:50:58,625 --> 01:51:01,167
To do or not to do

1304
01:51:02,458 --> 01:51:04,083
To be or not to be?

1305
01:51:04,125 --> 01:51:05,917
That is the question

1306
01:51:07,208 --> 01:51:10,333
To question or not to question

1307
01:51:11,042 --> 01:51:13,750
I can't find my dad too
for a long time

1308
01:51:13,792 --> 01:51:15,042
People say he committed suicide

1309
01:51:15,083 --> 01:51:16,542
I don't believe it

1310
01:51:17,083 --> 01:51:21,333
So should I raise hell
and destroy everyone

1311
01:51:22,125 --> 01:51:24,958
Or should I just
try to sleep it off?

1312
01:51:28,708 --> 01:51:31,667
There's a lot of peace in sleep

1313
01:51:33,042 --> 01:51:36,167
You don't question when asleep

1314
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,542
Everything seems so resolved

1315
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:44,458
Do you take sleeping pills?

1316
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:45,542
Are you doped?

1317
01:51:45,583 --> 01:51:46,917
Do you want to dope?

1318
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:54,250
I came cause I have no one

1319
01:51:54,292 --> 01:51:55,542
Then fuck off

1320
01:52:04,125 --> 01:52:06,083
See, you got two options

1321
01:52:06,417 --> 01:52:09,500
Get hold of a good man
and get married

1322
01:52:09,542 --> 01:52:11,667
Raise babies, like a TV series,

1323
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:16,042
Live an ordinary life

1324
01:52:18,333 --> 01:52:22,167
The other is become an escort,
a whore

1325
01:52:23,417 --> 01:52:25,375
Have fun, make money

1326
01:52:25,417 --> 01:52:27,083
Makes a lot of sense,
doesn't it?

1327
01:52:32,458 --> 01:52:35,000
Go. Get the shit out of here…

1328
01:53:07,458 --> 01:53:10,333
Hemanta?
What has happened?

1329
01:53:15,333 --> 01:53:16,833
I've killed someone

1330
01:53:29,125 --> 01:53:30,042
Kalyan?

1331
01:53:31,458 --> 01:53:33,083
No. Pulakbabu

1332
01:53:37,958 --> 01:53:39,000
Why're you doing this?

1333
01:53:40,292 --> 01:53:41,333
I didn't know

1334
01:53:45,667 --> 01:53:47,750
Was talking with mom

1335
01:53:48,292 --> 01:53:49,667
He was spying on us

1336
01:53:52,208 --> 01:53:53,667
I hit him with a statue

1337
01:53:53,708 --> 01:53:55,458
I didn't know it was him

1338
01:53:56,708 --> 01:53:57,708
Ok. Get up…

1339
01:54:03,208 --> 01:54:04,333
Where's the corpse?

1340
01:54:05,792 --> 01:54:06,708
I don't know

1341
01:54:13,542 --> 01:54:15,667
Kalyan's taking care of it

1342
01:54:16,958 --> 01:54:19,500
You need to come away
from all this

1343
01:54:22,708 --> 01:54:24,083
What should I do?

1344
01:54:24,583 --> 01:54:26,375
Just fall asleep?

1345
01:54:29,292 --> 01:54:30,500
You're an artise

1346
01:54:34,667 --> 01:54:36,667
Kalyan said the same shit

1347
01:54:38,792 --> 01:54:40,625
I don't care what Kalyan said!

1348
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,583
I don't give a damn

1349
01:54:43,708 --> 01:54:46,458
My company is rotten to the core

1350
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:47,250
Hemanta!!

1351
01:54:49,292 --> 01:54:51,875
I'm neck deep in a filth

1352
01:54:52,958 --> 01:54:55,958
Ritwik Ghatak was steeped in filth
but made great films

1353
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,083
Don't you dare lecture me now

1354
01:55:00,292 --> 01:55:03,958
Do you realize my dad
has been killed

1355
01:55:04,333 --> 01:55:07,250
The murderer is sharing bed
with my mom

1356
01:55:07,292 --> 01:55:09,333
I'm having to lie, cheat

1357
01:55:09,542 --> 01:55:11,667
And now I've killed someone!

1358
01:55:12,375 --> 01:55:14,000
Do you know what that means?

1359
01:55:26,625 --> 01:55:29,250
This world will
never change Hemanta

1360
01:55:34,625 --> 01:55:35,167
Never

1361
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:38,125
Come sit

1362
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:49,125
Himalayas will melt

1363
01:55:52,375 --> 01:55:55,542
Cities will be destroyed
by earthquakes

1364
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,167
If anything survives they will be
the books in your dad's library

1365
01:56:00,208 --> 01:56:02,167
Theatre, films…

1366
01:56:05,375 --> 01:56:08,000
Ray's Song Of The Road

1367
01:56:08,042 --> 01:56:09,458
Seen it?

1368
01:56:11,750 --> 01:56:13,000
You see it!

1369
01:56:23,625 --> 01:56:27,083
Hey… hey… what the fuck!!!

1370
01:56:33,750 --> 01:56:37,833
Why can't you tell me
if Hemanta is involved or not?

1371
01:56:39,792 --> 01:56:41,500
Why can't you be honest?

1372
01:56:41,958 --> 01:56:43,000
Just for one tell me

1373
01:56:44,417 --> 01:56:46,250
If Hemanta is involved or not?

1374
01:56:46,458 --> 01:56:47,875
You're insane

1375
01:56:48,667 --> 01:56:49,917
I'm mad?

1376
01:56:50,792 --> 01:56:52,625
Why can't you tell me the truth?

1377
01:56:56,500 --> 01:56:57,125
Look…

1378
01:56:58,042 --> 01:57:00,083
I understand your situation but…

1379
01:57:05,542 --> 01:57:08,833
Will you stand there or
answer her questions?

1380
01:57:11,833 --> 01:57:12,708
Uncle, tell me

1381
01:57:12,958 --> 01:57:13,875
Is Hemanta involved?

1382
01:57:19,458 --> 01:57:21,250
Why're you avoiding the truth?

1383
01:57:21,292 --> 01:57:21,958
Please tell me…

1384
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,542
Get hold of a nurse

1385
01:57:23,833 --> 01:57:25,458
Not nurse.
You tell me

1386
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:28,625
Is Hemanta involved in
dad's death or not?

1387
01:57:37,625 --> 01:57:38,708
No.

1388
01:57:40,583 --> 01:57:43,083
Hemanta is not involved

1389
01:57:45,542 --> 01:57:49,792
<i>Everybody knows
they have to go home</i>

1390
01:57:49,833 --> 01:57:54,125
<i>Everybody knows that
the other one knows</i>

1391
01:57:54,167 --> 01:57:58,417
<i>Everybody knows knows that
to come closer</i>

1392
01:57:58,458 --> 01:58:02,500
<i>Everybody takes off their clothes</i>

1393
01:58:04,708 --> 01:58:06,000
Ok sir. Yes sir...

1394
01:58:09,875 --> 01:58:10,917
Ok sir

1395
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,417
All this “sir” and sucking up…

1396
01:58:17,708 --> 01:58:20,167
Will he make you a star?

1397
01:58:21,250 --> 01:58:24,333
What's it to you?
Will you?

1398
01:58:25,583 --> 01:58:27,750
I'll go to the restroom

1399
01:58:27,792 --> 01:58:28,833
Where?

1400
01:58:32,542 --> 01:58:34,333
Out and on your left

1401
01:58:38,250 --> 01:58:41,750
And no tricks ok?

1402
01:58:42,500 --> 01:58:46,750
<i>Everybody knows thou shall not kill</i>

1403
01:58:46,792 --> 01:58:51,042
<i>Everybody knows they make mistakes</i>

1404
01:58:51,083 --> 01:58:55,292
<i>Everybody knows thou shall not lie</i>

1405
01:58:55,333 --> 01:58:57,500
<i>Everybody lies for their own sake</i>

1406
01:58:57,542 --> 01:58:58,708
So… what's he doing?

1407
01:59:02,167 --> 01:59:03,625
Lock the door?

1408
01:59:12,375 --> 01:59:14,625
Hey… that's rat poison

1409
01:59:15,542 --> 01:59:17,417
Huge rats here

1410
01:59:17,458 --> 01:59:19,208
Can't sleep at night

1411
01:59:28,292 --> 01:59:29,750
Boss called

1412
01:59:32,750 --> 01:59:34,292
What's he saying?

1413
01:59:37,417 --> 01:59:39,125
To kill Hemanta

1414
01:59:45,333 --> 01:59:46,333
So?

1415
01:59:50,458 --> 01:59:51,708
You'll do it?

1416
01:59:56,833 --> 01:59:58,375
Why not you?

1417
02:00:07,042 --> 02:00:08,583
I can't man…

1418
02:00:14,542 --> 02:00:16,583
He's a good man basically

1419
02:00:18,417 --> 02:00:20,958
He's the real owner of the company

1420
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,792
I admit he's crazy,

1421
02:00:24,708 --> 02:00:26,750
But he's a good guy

1422
02:00:28,958 --> 02:00:33,083
Havn't you bumped off
a good guy ever?

1423
02:00:34,833 --> 02:00:36,000
I have.

1424
02:00:37,917 --> 02:00:40,292
But not as good as him

1425
02:00:42,833 --> 02:00:45,167
Uncle is waiting to dump us in jail

1426
02:00:45,542 --> 02:00:47,500
Minimum 20 years.

1427
02:00:47,542 --> 02:00:49,375
You're forgetting Roshan?
Kartik?

1428
02:00:49,417 --> 02:00:50,333
And he'll let you off?

1429
02:00:50,375 --> 02:00:52,667
I'm not questioning.
You are

1430
02:00:54,708 --> 02:00:55,708
Look,

1431
02:00:55,917 --> 02:00:57,667
let's get rid of this nonsense

1432
02:00:57,708 --> 02:00:59,917
Get him drunk,
take him to the roof

1433
02:00:59,958 --> 02:01:01,333
Throw him down

1434
02:01:01,375 --> 02:01:04,958
As it is he's screwing up our live

1435
02:01:05,542 --> 02:01:07,333
Look he is

1436
02:01:07,625 --> 02:01:09,958
What if boss gets to know…

1437
02:01:10,667 --> 02:01:11,500
Wow!

1438
02:01:12,708 --> 02:01:14,667
All set man…

1439
02:01:17,542 --> 02:01:19,458
But I'm pretty hungry

1440
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:21,083
Anything will do

1441
02:01:21,125 --> 02:01:23,375
Kebabs and stuff

1442
02:01:32,625 --> 02:01:35,625
Getting it.
No tricks

1443
02:01:35,667 --> 02:01:37,083
Off course not

1444
02:01:39,042 --> 02:01:40,125
Thank you

1445
02:01:50,042 --> 02:01:54,292
Can I get some ice
or cold water?

1446
02:01:54,333 --> 02:01:58,500
<i>Everybody knows that water is free</i>

1447
02:01:58,542 --> 02:02:02,875
<i>Everybody knows the price of booze</i>

1448
02:02:02,917 --> 02:02:07,208
<i>Everybody knows
what's left what's right</i>

1449
02:02:07,250 --> 02:02:11,458
<i>Everybody's always free to choose</i>

1450
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:15,750
<i>Everybody knows the pain of hunger</i>

1451
02:02:15,792 --> 02:02:20,083
<i>Everybody knows insecurity</i>

1452
02:02:20,125 --> 02:02:24,333
<i>Everybody knows where it really hurts</i>

1453
02:02:24,375 --> 02:02:28,542
<i>Everybody feels, everybody can see</i>

1454
02:02:28,583 --> 02:02:32,917
<i>Everybody has got wet in the rain</i>

1455
02:02:32,958 --> 02:02:37,083
<i>Everybody wipes off their sweat</i>

1456
02:02:37,125 --> 02:02:41,958
<i>Everybody knows
when the song is over</i>

1457
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:45,625
<i>Everybody will forget the rest</i>

1458
02:02:45,667 --> 02:02:49,958
<i>Everybody wants a little more</i>

1459
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:54,333
<i>Everybody knows that little is less</i>

1460
02:02:54,375 --> 02:02:58,667
<i>Everybody knows
when the battle is over</i>

1461
02:02:58,708 --> 02:03:02,833
<i>The good guys lose like always</i>

1462
02:03:33,208 --> 02:03:34,708
I'm fine…

1463
02:03:47,333 --> 02:03:49,583
Hey… the bottle is fucking empty

1464
02:03:52,292 --> 02:03:54,917
Don't you want a drink?

1465
02:03:55,625 --> 02:03:58,042
No I'm fine. Got grass

1466
02:03:58,292 --> 02:03:59,250
I wanna smoke grass

1467
02:03:59,292 --> 02:04:00,333
Go for it man…

1468
02:04:01,458 --> 02:04:03,292
Then where'll we go to the roof?

1469
02:04:03,333 --> 02:04:04,458
Why roof?

1470
02:04:06,250 --> 02:04:08,042
Didn't we have some work
on the roof?

1471
02:04:08,083 --> 02:04:09,583
What work on the roof?

1472
02:04:09,625 --> 02:04:10,500
What work?

1473
02:04:18,667 --> 02:04:20,042
Hey Gupi?
Stomach ache?

1474
02:04:31,208 --> 02:04:33,250
Drink water. Hey buddy…

1475
02:04:33,292 --> 02:04:35,875
Lie down. Rest.. Water?

1476
02:04:44,875 --> 02:04:46,375
You'll fall baby.

1477
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:53,917
Easy easy…

1478
02:05:00,125 --> 02:05:03,000
The rats won't
bother him anymore

1479
02:05:04,292 --> 02:05:05,167
Er…

1480
02:05:08,542 --> 02:05:09,542
Why?

1481
02:05:11,542 --> 02:05:14,125
The packet of poison is empty

1482
02:05:25,333 --> 02:05:27,167
Where did it go?

1483
02:05:32,167 --> 02:05:34,167
In the bottle.
All of it

1484
02:06:08,917 --> 02:06:12,167
I never wanted to kill you

1485
02:06:41,917 --> 02:06:43,542
Neither did I

1486
02:06:46,125 --> 02:06:49,083
<i>Everybody knows
you can't serve all</i>

1487
02:06:49,125 --> 02:06:53,333
<i>Everyone knows someone'll
take the fall</i>

1488
02:06:53,375 --> 02:06:57,375
<i>Everybody knows when
you hurt somebody</i>

1489
02:06:57,417 --> 02:07:01,583
<i>It comes back to you cause
the world is small</i>

1490
02:07:01,625 --> 02:07:05,000
<i>Everybody knows when
the was is over</i>

1491
02:07:05,042 --> 02:07:08,667
<i>The bad guys won,
the good guys died</i>

1492
02:07:08,708 --> 02:07:12,375
<i>Everybody knows
when you get drunk</i>

1493
02:07:12,417 --> 02:07:16,750
<i>Everybody knows your
tongue gets tied</i>

1494
02:07:18,833 --> 02:07:19,625
Hey.

1495
02:07:21,208 --> 02:07:23,292
What're you doing here?

1496
02:07:24,250 --> 02:07:25,750
You won't come.

1497
02:07:26,333 --> 02:07:27,625
So I came

1498
02:07:28,208 --> 02:07:30,083
Not to stay.

1499
02:07:30,750 --> 02:07:32,667
Just to say a few words

1500
02:07:32,708 --> 02:07:33,583
Come lets..

1501
02:07:34,958 --> 02:07:36,333
Don't touch me!!!

1502
02:07:38,583 --> 02:07:40,667
You've again taken pills?

1503
02:07:41,542 --> 02:07:42,708
Listen

1504
02:07:44,333 --> 02:07:46,083
I'll listen.
But let's go in

1505
02:07:46,125 --> 02:07:47,792
No no.
Don't touch me

1506
02:07:47,958 --> 02:07:50,625
I havn't come to spend the night

1507
02:07:52,500 --> 02:07:55,875
Yuri you know I was busy…

1508
02:07:55,917 --> 02:07:56,958
With Hemanta!

1509
02:07:58,792 --> 02:08:00,375
Hemanta is my childhood friend

1510
02:08:00,417 --> 02:08:02,333
His dad raised me

1511
02:08:02,792 --> 02:08:04,833
He's back after so long

1512
02:08:05,458 --> 02:08:07,542
He's just my friend

1513
02:08:09,583 --> 02:08:12,250
These are some
important information

1514
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:14,750
You'll need them

1515
02:08:16,500 --> 02:08:19,292
You got what you needed

1516
02:08:20,917 --> 02:08:22,792
And Hemanta's back

1517
02:08:23,917 --> 02:08:25,458
I'm no longer required

1518
02:08:25,500 --> 02:08:28,917
I'm old enough to
understand that

1519
02:08:31,333 --> 02:08:33,208
What're you talking about?

1520
02:08:35,667 --> 02:08:37,542
You know what you mean to me..

1521
02:08:37,583 --> 02:08:38,500
What?

1522
02:08:38,625 --> 02:08:40,375
What am I to you?

1523
02:08:48,417 --> 02:08:50,958
Yuri Hemanta's in serious trouble

1524
02:08:52,083 --> 02:08:53,292
Am I not?

1525
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:56,542
Yuri your messed up.

1526
02:08:56,583 --> 02:08:58,167
You need treatment

1527
02:08:58,208 --> 02:09:01,500
Or else you can't think straight!

1528
02:09:08,583 --> 02:09:10,417
Straight!!!
So you're straight!!

1529
02:09:11,500 --> 02:09:14,500
You're straight and I'm bent?
Right?

1530
02:09:16,667 --> 02:09:18,250
Yuri…
- You're straight and I'm bent???

1531
02:09:18,292 --> 02:09:19,667
Don't touch me!

1532
02:09:20,542 --> 02:09:21,333
Yuri…

1533
02:09:23,167 --> 02:09:25,125
Just fuck off you cheat…

1534
02:09:25,167 --> 02:09:27,458
He's my friend.
Just a friend…!!!

1535
02:09:40,667 --> 02:09:44,917
<i>Everybody know you have
to go back</i>

1536
02:09:44,958 --> 02:09:49,208
<i>Everybody knows
yes everybody knows</i>

1537
02:09:49,250 --> 02:09:53,583
<i>Everybody knows when
you say goodbye</i>

1538
02:09:53,625 --> 02:09:58,125
<i>You bid farewell
without your clothes</i>

1539
02:10:47,292 --> 02:10:52,042
Guess she hung herself.
From the fan

1540
02:10:52,542 --> 02:10:54,208
With that scarf

1541
02:10:56,750 --> 02:10:57,833
God knows when

1542
02:11:03,208 --> 02:11:05,292
You were in the next room…

1543
02:11:05,500 --> 02:11:07,583
You returned yesterday…

1544
02:11:07,958 --> 02:11:10,250
What were you doing?

1545
02:11:11,042 --> 02:11:13,292
I'm always with her

1546
02:11:14,125 --> 02:11:16,667
Just stepped out for a
few minutes at night…

1547
02:11:20,417 --> 02:11:22,500
Gayatri madam came.

1548
02:11:23,292 --> 02:11:25,042
Kalyan sir is coming

1549
02:11:26,917 --> 02:11:30,542
Don't touch the scarf.
It'll go for post mortem…

1550
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:44,875
Come you fucker.
I'll kill you…

1551
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:48,833
Lalit please…

1552
02:11:51,542 --> 02:11:52,583
Get up you asshole…

1553
02:11:55,208 --> 02:11:56,458
I'll kill you…

1554
02:11:59,750 --> 02:12:01,667
Lalit stop it.

1555
02:12:03,875 --> 02:12:05,292
Hemanta please…

1556
02:12:06,375 --> 02:12:07,375
Stop this.

1557
02:12:18,625 --> 02:12:20,042
Feeling better?

1558
02:12:26,917 --> 02:12:28,375
What happened to him?

1559
02:12:31,833 --> 02:12:33,208
Drug overdose

1560
02:12:33,250 --> 02:12:36,250
You were both
brought in together

1561
02:12:40,958 --> 02:12:41,917
Sister,

1562
02:12:41,958 --> 02:12:44,458
make it fast.
Got to call the morgue

1563
02:12:44,500 --> 02:12:45,500
Hang on.

1564
02:12:46,500 --> 02:12:48,667
Have to clean the body first…

1565
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:51,042
Drug overdoze?

1566
02:12:51,458 --> 02:12:55,667
Came before. For 7 days.
Survived and left…

1567
02:13:03,542 --> 02:13:05,000
Yuri Bose

1568
02:13:09,833 --> 02:13:11,458
What did he do?

1569
02:13:11,833 --> 02:13:16,167
Something to do with computers…

1570
02:13:19,083 --> 02:13:20,750
Am sick of it all…

1571
02:13:20,792 --> 02:13:23,125
There's this patient
in the next room.

1572
02:13:23,167 --> 02:13:25,292
Won't live.
Brain cancer…

1573
02:13:25,333 --> 02:13:28,250
But they're spending
money like water…

1574
02:13:28,292 --> 02:13:30,250
What's the point
of all this anguish?

1575
02:13:30,458 --> 02:13:33,958
Finally everyone will be
either buried or burnt

1576
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,167
We all have to go

1577
02:13:40,792 --> 02:13:42,958
Life is very short my son…

1578
02:13:45,708 --> 02:13:46,917
Dr Mukherjee!

1579
02:14:09,750 --> 02:14:11,500
Gayatri? Why aren't you
taking your medicines?

1580
02:14:11,542 --> 02:14:14,833
- Sir she's sleeping.
- But she has to take her pills

1581
02:14:15,458 --> 02:14:19,667
You know how adamant she is

1582
02:14:20,375 --> 02:14:23,833
You're paid to do
your job not be her slave

1583
02:14:27,708 --> 02:14:29,792
I'm told she's sleeping
since morning

1584
02:14:29,833 --> 02:14:31,000
Is this a joke

1585
02:14:31,583 --> 02:14:32,917
What did the doc say?

1586
02:14:32,958 --> 02:14:34,208
She has to take her medicines

1587
02:14:34,250 --> 02:14:34,875
Sir…

1588
02:14:35,167 --> 02:14:36,083
What?

1589
02:14:36,125 --> 02:14:39,417
If you don't like
my work I'll leave.

1590
02:14:39,708 --> 02:14:42,000
Get lost.
Give me her medicines and go!!!

1591
02:14:47,083 --> 02:14:48,083
Fast.

1592
02:14:49,250 --> 02:14:50,250
Out!!

1593
02:14:56,708 --> 02:14:59,042
Gaytri get up and take
your medicines

1594
02:15:02,500 --> 02:15:04,708
Get up and take your pills

1595
02:15:31,083 --> 02:15:32,375
Gayatri?!!!

1596
02:15:39,958 --> 02:15:42,750
Nurse! Nurse…

1597
02:15:42,958 --> 02:15:45,500
Give me the keys.
I'll drive uncle home.

1598
02:15:46,125 --> 02:15:47,125
You can go…

1599
02:16:27,042 --> 02:16:28,250
You can out?

1600
02:16:28,958 --> 02:16:31,083
Aunty's body is not cremated?

1601
02:16:31,708 --> 02:16:34,708
Did you go to Yuri's Funeral?

1602
02:16:41,375 --> 02:16:42,375
No.

1603
02:16:45,125 --> 02:16:46,167
Couldn't face it

1604
02:16:46,750 --> 02:16:48,542
Can't face it either

1605
02:17:00,750 --> 02:17:01,917
Here. Take this

1606
02:17:06,208 --> 02:17:07,500
Do what you want

1607
02:17:07,542 --> 02:17:08,667
What's this?

1608
02:17:10,750 --> 02:17:14,125
Keys to Kalyan's car.
Given the driver off.

1609
02:17:16,167 --> 02:17:17,167
Do it

1610
02:17:28,167 --> 02:17:29,167
Really?

1611
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:35,125
Or your coming back
makes to sense

1612
02:17:39,125 --> 02:17:40,125
Go.

1613
02:17:46,417 --> 02:17:49,042
You take this.
Print it all.

1614
02:17:52,167 --> 02:17:55,417
Your job is to tell the truth.
Tell it.

1615
02:17:55,750 --> 02:17:57,208
All that can happen later…

1616
02:17:57,250 --> 02:17:59,042
It'll be too late…

1617
02:18:04,042 --> 02:18:07,583
Or else Yuri's death
will not make any sense

1618
02:18:15,417 --> 02:18:16,458
Take it

1619
02:18:21,708 --> 02:18:22,708
See you

1620
02:18:29,958 --> 02:18:33,500
If you can,
spare a few good words for me…

1621
02:18:44,167 --> 02:18:47,125
Where are we going?

1622
02:18:48,333 --> 02:18:49,333
Dunno

1623
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,042
We've a lot of work

1624
02:19:02,625 --> 02:19:07,875
Need to call a press meet

1625
02:19:12,292 --> 02:19:15,583
Have somehow managed to
bribe the cops and

1626
02:19:15,958 --> 02:19:18,750
Hush up the suicide

1627
02:19:21,792 --> 02:19:24,000
Now we need to hush up the press

1628
02:19:24,042 --> 02:19:25,667
After all she was Gayatri

1629
02:19:25,708 --> 02:19:27,125
She deserves better

1630
02:19:33,750 --> 02:19:35,375
And she was your mother

1631
02:19:36,583 --> 02:19:38,708
Your brother was my father

1632
02:19:39,875 --> 02:19:43,708
He also deserved better that
what you gave him

1633
02:19:47,542 --> 02:19:49,292
Where are we going?

1634
02:19:49,958 --> 02:19:51,417
I dunno

1635
02:19:54,583 --> 02:19:56,333
What I did was for your good.

1636
02:19:56,375 --> 02:19:58,292
For the good of the company

1637
02:20:00,667 --> 02:20:03,792
Pulak's death was
hushed up to save you

1638
02:20:04,833 --> 02:20:06,917
Or you would've been in jail

1639
02:20:11,667 --> 02:20:13,750
I know you killed Raju and Gupi

1640
02:20:13,833 --> 02:20:15,833
Yet I'm not handing you over

1641
02:20:15,875 --> 02:20:17,292
Can't you guess why?
