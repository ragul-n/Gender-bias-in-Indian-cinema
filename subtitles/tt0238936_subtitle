1
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:42,833
Badi Ma, Dwijdas, Kumud, Padma, Dharamdas, where's everybody? 

2
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:48,458
Look, here's Devdas' letter. Devdas is returning from London 

3
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,000
Really? Happy tidings! 

4
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:58,125
Dwijdas! You hear? Devdas is coming! - I don't think so. Ma is lying 

5
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,791
You're lying, Ma. - Here's the letter 

6
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,875
Show me the letter 

7
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,083
Shubhankar! My Devdas is coming! - Really? 

8
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,583
Give your brother the good news 

9
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:15,458
Badi Ma... Badi Ma... my Tempest is coming home 

10
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,375
Thank God 

11
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:23,791
Compliments, lady! - Not in tears Dharamdas 

12
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,916
I want a promise. I am going... to receive Devdas. I alone. 

13
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,375
Yes, but wind the clocks once again After so many years! My son is back 

14
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:39,916
Winding clocks won't make time move, nor any faster brings the son home 

15
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:44,375
I know Kumud! But look how my heart throbs 

16
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,375
Oh when will the day give way to the night...? 

17
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:54,458
Drum up the cheer! Let the music play 

18
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:59,791
What joyous tempest stirs my heartstrings! Drum up the cheer 

19
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:05,541
Let the music play! - Welcome the onset of Tempest 

20
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,875
All day I'm hollering at everyone to get ready, and no one listens? 

21
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:22,250
The house has been spruced up. - Devdas' room is ready 

22
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:30,625
Dharamdas has tethered the horses. - Badi Ma decided who wears what 

23
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,208
Happy...? 

24
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:37,208
Once you get your baby, you'll know what joy is in seeing him come home 

25
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:41,000
Kaushalya Didi (Didi: sister) - Goodness! Here comes the actress 

26
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,625
In she traipses and, "Ei Kaushalya Didi..." 

27
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,416
"sweet"Shondesh"for you" 

28
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:51,750
"Hey Kaushalya sister, look..." 

29
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,791
"...I have brought sweets for you." 

30
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:58,375
Sumitra! Lovely timing! - Sumitra-Kaki's timing! 

31
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:02,916
Always opportune. And your "Shondesh" is famous! 

32
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Hear that Didi? - Let her talk. Guess who's coming? 

33
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,958
I know! Mr Chattopadhyay...? 

34
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:16,458
Silly! You won't believe this! My Tempest, my Devdas is coming! 

35
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,666
Really Didi...? - Yes, yes, really! 

36
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,458
Thank Goddess Durga 

37
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:26,291
My compliments, Didi! - I'm seeing my son after 10 years 

38
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,083
What might he look like? What might he sound like? What will he tell me? 

39
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,833
How am I going to survive tonight, Sumitra? 

40
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:42,916
How I wish I wouldn't blink! What if he walks in right then? 

41
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,083
I only remember Devdas, the boy who'd walk up to my house... 

42
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:54,250
peep around the door to ask me... - Kaki-Ma, is Paro in? 

43
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,750
There she goes, into the act 

44
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:04,375
And when Dev stormed out, I'd send Paro to find him 

45
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:08,375
Found him always in guava orchards. - And Dharamdas would haul him in... 

46
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:15,375
by his ear! Some friendship! - And when Devdas was leaving... 

47
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,375
going abroad for his studies, how my Paro ran after his buggy... 

48
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:22,791
as if possessed. Arre O'Deva 

49
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,625
Arre O'Deva 

50
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:29,000
In that scorching sun, her feet blistering on the gravelly soil... 

51
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:36,291
yet she ran on, screaming, "I'm going with Dev" 

52
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:41,125
I'm going abroad too! - Are you out of your mind? 

53
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:48,125
Send her abroad? My silly girl 

54
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,125
She owed Dev three Rupees 

55
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:58,166
Let me go. I got to give him his 3 Rupees 

56
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,666
A lamp lit for a loved one draws the wayfarer home 

57
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,875
For 10 years, in that belief she kept that lamp alight for Dev 

58
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:17,416
Not once she let the lamp go out! I must tell her, she'll be glad 

59
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,958
She will be overjoyed. - Yes Sumitra, go 

60
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:29,083
It's your son who's coming home and she is the happier for it 

61
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,708
Why not? She's our neighbour. Paro and Devdas... 

62
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,708
were childhood friends. - What's left of that childhood? 

63
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,291
Both are grown ups now... Kaki-Ma's "Shondesh"? 

64
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:55,750
Paro! 

65
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:01,500
What's up Kaki-Ma? - Manorama, where is Paro? 

66
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:05,291
Where else? Must be in her room, talking to her lamp 

67
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,916
Not lamp! - Devdas 

68
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,166
Oh God. - What's the matter? 

69
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:15,666
The news I have for her will drive her mad with joy 

70
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,083
What news? 

71
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,083
Paro, Devdas is coming 

72
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:25,000
Really? - Yes, Devdas is coming 

73
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:30,083
They're preparing for a welcome! Kaushalya-Didi is nearly going mad 

74
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,708
The whole house is in raptures... 

75
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,291
Silly, are you crying? 

76
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,833
Let not tears of joy douse the lamp before Dev arrives 

77
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:44,375
No power on Earth can put out this lamp 

78
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,625
Shall we put the mighty lamp to test? 

79
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,500
"At season's change..." 

80
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,666
"comes..." 

81
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:33,041
"cloudwaves" 

82
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,916
"A waft..." 

83
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,625
"will come..." 

84
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:42,416
"to blow out this lamp" 

85
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:52,500
"This longing I didn't let die" 

86
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:09,833
"This longing I never let die" 

87
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:16,250
"This lamp, my love..." 

88
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:22,916
"will never be extinguished, this flame of my love" 

89
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
"My love, come to me my love" 

90
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:35,958
"Now come to me" 

91
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,541
"As this lamp burns..." 

92
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:45,791
"I'm burning in my every pore and my heart" 

93
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:49,375
"Now come to me" 

94
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:56,750
"Come to me, my love" 

95
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:43,250
"Distance parted us..." 

96
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:47,041
"Distance parted us..." 

97
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:50,166
"there was the pain of parting" 

98
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,708
"My eyes yearned..." 

99
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:58,750
"but there you were..." 

100
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:02,416
"glittering, glowing..." 

101
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,541
"awash in joys..." 

102
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,083
"while here..." 

103
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:19,541
"while here, I burned" 

104
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,708
"Once again, clouds thunder..." 

105
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:28,291
"raining in thunderous rhapsody" 

106
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,375
"Tempest strikes again..." 

107
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:35,083
"but my lamp is never doused..." 

108
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:38,166
"my love, my flame..." 

109
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:44,750
"no matter how much the rains, tempest and thunder torment you" 

110
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:52,416
"Come now, come to me, my love" 

111
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:59,916
"Come, my love" 

112
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:08,000
"She's crazy" 

113
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:11,375
"She's naive" 

114
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:17,708
"Oh yes, with a gust of wind will come the one you seek" 

115
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,583
"My love..." 

116
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:23,458
"come to me my love" 

117
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:31,583
"This longing I didn't let die" 

118
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:39,000
"My love, this lamp is you" 

119
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:44,083
"My love..." 

120
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:49,000
"My love..." 

121
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:54,000
"My love..." 

122
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:13,208
Hurry! The buggy is here! Kaushalya, quick 

123
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,583
Devdas is here! - Coming 

124
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:21,208
I was lighting the welcome-lamp. Tell Badi-Ma 

125
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,583
If you take so much time, Devdas will give himself a welcome 

126
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:28,333
Give himself a welcome? Today, I'm welcoming him 

127
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:35,500
Wait a minute! I get to see Devdas first. Everyone shut your eyes 

128
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,875
For my sake. - All right? 

129
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:44,083
Lady! I don't believe! Could the world change so much in ten years? 

130
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:50,208
Deva is as tall as my shoulders, my very shoulders he sat upon 

131
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,416
Once when you see him you will forget to wink. 

132
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,666
Don't trouble me, tell me, where is my Dev? 

133
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,000
Got off on the way. Said, he will be back after seeing "My Paro" 

134
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,583
Should be here any moment 

135
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:07,500
Chhoto-Ma, you wanted to be the first to set your eyes on Devdas? 

136
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,666
Will it be Paro's eyes now? 

137
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,875
Chhoto-Ma, what to do with this? 

138
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:30,833
Paro 

139
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,291
I think it's Devdas 

140
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,833
Devdas... 

141
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:50,000
how have you been? Fine? Come in son, welcome 

142
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,333
Bless you, son 

143
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:58,666
You look just like an Englishman! We've been so eager to see you 

144
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,000
Kaushalya-Didi is dying to see you. - Where is Paro? 

145
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,958
She was here a moment ago 

146
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,916
She said, let Devdas come and I'll do this and I'll do that 

147
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'll fight with him and scratch him. Now you're here and she's hiding 

148
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,166
Ei Paro 

149
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,500
Can I go upstairs? - Yes son, go on 

150
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,916
How have you been Paro? 

151
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,875
Won't you turn to see my face? We're meeting after so many days 

152
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:53,750
Days? For you, maybe. For me... 

153
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:57,500
10 years, 6 months, 4 days and 6 hours 

154
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:02,000
You never missed me? - I did 

155
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,291
Lies! Only 5 letters in 10 years? There are four seasons in a year 

156
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,750
Couldn't you write once a season? - Makes sense. You're a big girl 

157
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,291
Takes time? 

158
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,833
The desire to meet the sea turns the stream into a river 

159
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,291
Then why take time to show your face? 

160
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:28,458
Like sighting the Moon after ages, I fear I'll leave you breathless 

161
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:36,166
Not even the Moon is as vain. - But the Moon is scarred 

162
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:42,000
Till moonrise spare the Moon, to see which leaves me breathless... 

163
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:46,041
the Moon's radiance? Or your vanity? 

164
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:56,708
Paro, I hate the thought of someone else touching you 

165
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,208
Look, Devdas is here! - Let him come 

166
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,375
Don't be cross. - I don't want to talk to him 

167
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,666
Tell him to go away. - But Ma... 

168
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,875
I said, I don't want to... - Ma 

169
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,291
Go, I don't want to see your face 

170
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:29,000
Why, what's so ugly about my face... 

171
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:33,208
that neither Paro nor you want to see? 

172
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:36,750
After 10 years of waiting, the neighbour gets to welcome you? 

173
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,625
Go back to your Paro 

174
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,708
Won't you open your eyes? - I won't 

175
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,791
Won't see me either? 

176
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:58,000
Very well, I'm going away. - Where...? 

177
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,916
Where are you going, Dev? - Dev, stop 

178
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:04,125
Why did you let him leave? I was just joking 

179
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,416
I was joking too 

180
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,000
Dev. 

181
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:25,708
My prodigal son returns a lawyer. But no let up on the mischief? 

182
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:32,375
Babu-ji...? (Babu-ji: Father) - He left for his chambers early... 

183
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,416
something urgent. - I know, I know 

184
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,625
Complaints every day! 

185
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:44,041
Dev and Paro never went to school. Dev caught smoking 

186
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,291
All day tramping around the village with that Paro 

187
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,125
Not another moment for you in this house 

188
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,666
Now get out! 

189
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,875
The day I left, he wasn't at home 

190
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,666
This day I return, he still isn't here 

191
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,083
You know, the British government is knighting him 

192
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,916
I see! - And he'll be so glad to see you 

193
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,666
Really? - Glad he is, at work 

194
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:19,291
In my home, fathers welcome sons returning home after years... 

195
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:22,375
with arms outstretched. - Same here, child 

196
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:27,291
Come to me, my darling 

197
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:28,833
Aunt! 

198
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:37,458
I told you to get me a nice foreign watch 

199
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,333
Have you brought it? 

200
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:44,250
No, but I bring fortuitous times 

201
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,208
Look... 

202
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:53,166
over here... but I can't even make out clearly 

203
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:59,458
They use only paper? - And sometimes, not even that 

204
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:01,750
I never shook hands 

205
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:09,666
What are you upto? 

206
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,083
Give my box back to me 

207
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:15,833
Give it to me 

208
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:19,541
What's happening? - Nothing 

209
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,375
Watching Devdas? How do you find him? 

210
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,791
I'm not telling. - Tell me... 

211
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:28,541
how do you find him? - Like a fool 

212
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:33,000
What did he say when he met you? - I didn't show him my face 

213
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,833
Swear that by your mother? - I swear 

214
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:38,250
Poor thing, must've been pining. - Let him pine 

215
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,625
Don't make him suffer so 

216
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:43,375
Else, he'll come peeping around the door... 

217
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,333
and ask me, "Kaki-Ma, is Paro in?" 

218
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:56,708
Only in the moonlight he gets to see my face 

219
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:45,916
Card three and I win. - Damn 

220
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,250
Hey, what are you doing! 

221
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:49,708
Lost by a whisker. - You always lose by a whisker 

222
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:55,708
Kumud, so what if he wins once? - Wrong, today's Shubhankar's day 

223
00:26:55,791 --> 00:27:00,000
No one else wins, here comes Paro but she can't win either 

224
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:05,000
You bet? - Beware! She'll loot you 

225
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,666
Well Paro, what have you brought? - "Shondesh" for Devdas. Ma sent it 

226
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:19,375
Where's Devdas? - The London-returned gentleman? 

227
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:25,083
Where else but in his room, training his binoculars on London? 

228
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:34,750
"The beloved is going to meet her lover." 

229
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:42,458
Saw? Earlier, she'd greet you first. Up she climbs, our beauty... 

230
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:48,541
straight for Devdas. - One too many a sweet message 

231
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:57,500
What brings the Moon down to Earth? - To take your breath away 

232
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,375
What are you doing? - Seeing how good my guess was 

233
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,916
Accurate? - Could never be wrong 

234
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:10,000
How come? - Known you for ages 

235
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:16,041
What's this? - Platter 

236
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:20,250
I know. But what's on it? - My excuse 

237
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
"Shondesh" for me? - See for yourself 

238
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:29,250
Empty...? - That's the excuse, silly 

239
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,125
Goodness! What a temper! 

240
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,416
You make a fine example of how to lose temper 

241
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,333
You're the same 

242
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:45,125
You too are just the same. 

243
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:48,166
Like what...? - Unsophisticated 

244
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:54,166
Naturally, after all, you're London-returned 

245
00:28:55,541 --> 00:29:00,000
London's a big city, isn't it Dev? - London's entirely different 

246
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:04,541
Great personalities, great debates. Huge thoroughfares, huge edifices... 

247
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:09,375
and London's Trafalgar Square, pigeons, doves... 

248
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:11,666
The Queen's Palace 

249
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,833
And milling crowds, everywhere 

250
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,083
Do you know, Paro... 

251
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:18,000
Londoners live in a world of their own? 

252
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:20,500
And you? - Of course. 

253
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,875
You are so silly. 

254
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:25,208
Mention not. 

255
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,708
Say, you never missed the village? - Never, never, except... 

256
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:40,000
when I was fed up of the food at the hostel, I missed Ma's dishes 

257
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:44,125
And back in London, when someone screamed at me... 

258
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,541
I was reminded of my father. No one else 

259
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,791
On evening walks, I contemplated Dharamdas and his buggy 

260
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:59,375
On sleepless nights, grandmother's gentle pat 

261
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:03,541
Nothing else 

262
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:11,541
Dev... and... 

263
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:16,291
And...? - I...? 

264
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:19,541
Never. Or was it once...? 

265
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:25,750
No, you never came to mind, Paro. - I never came to mind...? 

266
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:29,000
Matters that come to mind are matters that matter. But... 

267
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:35,625
you don't matter, Paro. - True Dev, only you matter 

268
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:44,333
5 letters, 5 times a day. How many times did I read them each year? 

269
00:30:46,416 --> 00:30:49,375
And how many times in ten years? - Multiplied by...? 

270
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:54,541
18,250 times. That's how much you matter... 

271
00:30:55,208 --> 00:31:00,750
and ten years to the day, I have kept alive the flame I lit for you 

272
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:06,708
How many hours has it been burning? - If I were to count... 

273
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:14,083
87,600 hours. So much you matter, every second I remembered you 

274
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:20,708
How many seconds to a day? - I know, I'll tell you... 

275
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,291
You're bad at arithmetic 

276
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,916
Hey... hey Paro... 

277
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:33,375
There were times when I missed you. - When...? 

278
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:38,291
Whenever I breathed 

279
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:45,833
For them, reminiscences, those who can be forgotten. Silly 

280
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:50,125
So effortlessly you counted off those seconds? 

281
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:53,916
Without as much as a thought to every passing second... 

282
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
that carried me away? 

283
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,375
In the flame of the lamp that you lit, it was I who burned 

284
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:19,041
87,600 

285
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,041
Pity 

286
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:31,250
Shall I tell you what's on my mind for sometime? 

287
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:35,291
Two names on your mind. Paro and Devdas 

288
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:39,541
Mr Landlord! How did you make out? 

289
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:44,291
Kumud was saying, Dev and Paro are upto new antics 

290
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:47,000
For hours they stare at each other through binoculars 

291
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:52,166
"Shondesh" is her excuse for coming over. I don't like it 

292
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:57,250
And Sumitra is daydreaming of Paro's wedding to Devdas 

293
00:32:57,958 --> 00:33:03,541
Daydreams never come true. Neelkanth married an actress 

294
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:08,416
Disgraced himself. In an alliance with a disgraced family... 

295
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,375
am I to bring my family to ridicule...? 

296
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:15,333
Right, but you know Sumitra. She shoots off her mouth 

297
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:19,083
What if she storms in someday proposing an alliance? 

298
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:23,083
The answer will be "no" - Why will the answer be no? 

299
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:29,708
A knight and a landlord. And the roof over our heads is leaking 

300
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:31,375
Leaking...? 

301
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:37,041
Even my postal address has changed. - Really...? 

302
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:42,833
Neelkanth Chakraborty, Old Mansion 

303
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:50,458
What's lacking in our Paro? She's pretty, she's literate 

304
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:53,458
I only got to spread the word. Tens of boys will be ready... 

305
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:56,083
to pay a bride-price for Paro. - Really? 

306
00:33:56,333 --> 00:34:00,416
Yes. You are worrying overmuch 

307
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,208
Someday we will get a proposal... from them. You'll see 

308
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:08,708
Till then, I leave you to your musings. I'm off for my nap 

309
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:20,541
Mr Landlord! Have a care! Your old mansion is crumbling 

310
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:24,000
Broke my back 

311
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:38,458
All this jewellery! All for me? - You will give me a grandson 

312
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:40,750
Won't I give you something? 

313
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:43,791
Badi-Ma has opened up her treasure trove. Loot her 

314
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:46,125
I must! 

315
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:50,333
Badi-Ma! How exquisite! I must wear this 

316
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:55,083
No, that one isn't for you. - Then, for whom? 

317
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:59,458
For my Devdas' bride. - Let's see 

318
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:03,791
Give it all away to Devdas' bride! I want none of this 

319
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:07,208
Here's your elder daughter-in-law 

320
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:09,208
And everyone's all agog about someone who's yet to come 

321
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:13,541
Nice bracelet, isn't it? It'll look great on your arm 

322
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:17,000
In my father's house maids wear bracelets like these 

323
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:20,375
Then consider yourself a maid, right Badi-Ma? 

324
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:25,750
Yes! I'm maidservant in this house. My brother-in-law! Always after me 

325
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:32,000
You're making a mountain out of a molehill. I was joking 

326
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:35,625
If you disapprove, I won't even marry. - I hate being ridiculed 

327
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Why rib her all the time? Badi-Ma you could've said yes... 

328
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:44,583
if only to please her. You know her nature. And she's pregnant 

329
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:48,291
And you've brought her to tears. Now I got to placate her. Woe betide 

330
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:58,666
No matter how much honey you add, "neem" is always bitter 

331
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:02,291
How do you like this bracelet? 

332
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:08,375
Just like you. Exotic. - Whom are you giving it to? 

333
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:12,875
You want to see? 

334
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:19,000
Take this. - And do what? 

335
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:23,375
Look through it. This bracelet is for whoever you see in it 

336
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:25,125
Wait. Wait. 

337
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:31,375
Goodness! Sumitra? 

338
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:33,791
Bye. 

339
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:40,208
Is she the one? Are you mad? - Yes, but not entirely. Look up 

340
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:43,291
That's Parvati. - Nice...? 

341
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:49,416
Yes nice, but I see her every day. - Do you see her as my bride? 

342
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,583
Wretched girl! - Now what's up? 

343
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,916
Staring at me through binoculars! - Goodness 

344
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:01,750
She's gone hiding. - She must be embarrassed 

345
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:08,208
Been chatting over binoculars? - Yes Badi-Ma 

346
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:11,000
Take a look, what's the wretch upto? 

347
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:17,375
Goodness! She's watching me out of the corner of her eyes 

348
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:20,041
Ran 

349
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:24,166
Have you run in too, Dev? 

350
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:44,250
Wretched boy 

351
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:50,541
How to make mountains out of a molehill... 

352
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:58,958
I'll show my mother-in-law. Chhoto-Ma... 

353
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:08,083
So you got caught peeping. - You got caught too 

354
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:12,083
And I was sentenced to punish you 

355
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:16,375
For you 

356
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:18,541
What...? - Gift 

357
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:20,791
You might as well put it on me 

358
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:24,000
So many bangles 

359
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,708
Silly 

360
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:26,916
Forget it 

361
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,250
Tell me, where is London? - Way west 

362
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:33,500
Where sets the Sun? - In the West 

363
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:36,166
The Sun rises over London five hours late every day? 

364
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:38,833
Yes - Is that why you're late... 

365
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,041
about understanding everything? - Yes... 

366
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:46,000
Dolt from London! Can't even take my bangles off 

367
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:48,083
How will you ever make me wear a bracelet? 

368
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:19,333
"My cruel lover is heartless" 

369
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:29,666
"My cruel lover is so heartless..." 

370
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:34,791
"he doesn't even know how I pine, he's just a ruthless slaver..." 

371
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:39,708
"oh cruel, please..." 

372
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:45,875
"How do I say this, whom do I tell?" 

373
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:51,958
"God, he doesn't know how I hurt..." 

374
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,375
"he knows not..." 

375
00:39:56,458 --> 00:40:03,125
"how heartless" 

376
00:40:05,291 --> 00:40:11,416
"how heartless" 

377
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:37,125
"You were far away, yet so close..." 

378
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:41,791
"now you're close yet distant...?" 

379
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:44,250
"I don't know... yet I know" 

380
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:53,708
"You were far away, yet so close... now you're close, yet distant...?" 

381
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:55,041
"Come..." 

382
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:57,250
"to me" 

383
00:40:57,333 --> 00:41:02,750
"Adorn me with the bangle" - Let me read your palm 

384
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:05,916
"Don't tease me" - Lots of money 

385
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,375
"Now don't..." - Your marriage 

386
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:11,666
"Do my bidding" - You'll marry an old man 

387
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:15,291
"How do I say this..." - About your wedding 

388
00:41:15,458 --> 00:41:22,666
"Whom do I tell... God" - You'll never marry 

389
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:27,666
"Fool, he doesn't even know..." 

390
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,125
"he just doesn't know" 

391
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:26,791
Shame! 

392
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:31,583
You see how the childhood love blossoms into youthful romance? 

393
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:36,458
For all Sumitra's "Shondesh", do send a sweet message to Sumitra 

394
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:40,958
Tell her, Paro has come of age 

395
00:42:44,291 --> 00:42:46,291
What are you upto? 

396
00:42:51,041 --> 00:42:52,791
What am I upto? 

397
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:59,375
What's up? What's wrong with Ma? - Your mother has gone mad. 

398
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:07,291
Yes! Mad with joy. Because no more will I dream the dream I dreamt 

399
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:10,791
And why? - Because it's coming true 

400
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:15,375
Ma, what dream...? - Which dream? Silly! 

401
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:19,291
I'm invited to a huge mansion. - I know, Kumud has conceived 

402
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:26,375
Also, Kaushalya-Didi wants to see me. She says, Paro has come of age 

403
00:43:26,458 --> 00:43:29,000
We ought to think about Paro's wedding 

404
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:37,083
True Paro, when you step into that house in bridal finery... 

405
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:42,291
there will be dreams in your eyes, under the veil drawn over your face 

406
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:47,458
But we'll listen in joyous rapture for the chime in your anklets 

407
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:07,083
Mr Landlord! So how do I look? - Where's Paro? Isn't she going? 

408
00:44:07,166 --> 00:44:11,375
So long she awaited this evening, she was dressed and raring to go 

409
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:15,000
In time to leave, she shies away. Off to the lake to fetch water 

410
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:17,875
Why? - Silly girl, she's afraid... 

411
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:21,083
that I might discuss her marriage right in front of her 

412
00:44:21,666 --> 00:44:26,625
Don't you raise the topic Sumitra - The auspicious time runs out at 7 

413
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:29,416
By then if she hasn't raised the topic, I shall 

414
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:37,416
But don't worry. The answer won't be a "no". Bless me 

415
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:42,625
The guests are all here. Where is Sumitra-Kaki? 

416
00:44:43,041 --> 00:44:47,750
Dreaming of Paro's wedding. To Devdas. You know... 

417
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:51,083
I've found a nice match for Paro. - Who...? 

418
00:44:52,291 --> 00:44:55,000
Old Mr Chattopadhyay 

419
00:44:57,416 --> 00:45:03,291
My compliments, sister! Best wishes for a grandson 

420
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:07,541
Don't overdo it, Sumitra. There's still time to go 

421
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:10,708
Only a few months, no? 

422
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,833
Then the baby's wails will resonate through the mansion 

423
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:20,000
Not sister, I'll call you grandma. - You should get Paro married soon 

424
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:25,958
I'd like to call you grannie too. - That's what I'm here to discuss 

425
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:32,000
I must discuss something too. Girls in your family fetch a bride price? 

426
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:37,791
No, that was olden custom. We will give our Paro away 

427
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:42,791
So it's final. I'll give Paro away in wedding. All the expense is mine 

428
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:46,791
Paro is my daughter too. - No, giving the daughter away... 

429
00:45:46,875 --> 00:45:51,208
is a dream every parent dreams. About the expense, we can share it 

430
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:54,916
Then it's decided, Sumitra. - Really Didi? 

431
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,375
Yes, really. - Therefore Kaki-Ma, you will be... 

432
00:45:58,458 --> 00:46:03,958
the master of ceremonies tonight. A stunning dance for the guests? 

433
00:46:04,291 --> 00:46:06,458
Oh no, not I... - Why not? Don't you belong... 

434
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:12,583
to a family of theatre dancers? - Yes Didi, but that was ages ago 

435
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:18,875
No Kaki-Ma, no excuses. Tonight you sing and you dance 

436
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:22,791
No dear, not I... - Are you embarrassed? Just imagine 

437
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:29,041
You're dancing at Paro's wedding. - Now I can't refuse, can I? 

438
00:46:30,166 --> 00:46:33,583
So be it. Radha and Krishna and love divine 

439
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:42,791
"Dearest love" 

440
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:47,375
"The Moon alone..." 

441
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:49,708
"in night's embrace..." 

442
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:59,541
"in moonlight vigil, night's desire..." 

443
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:16,625
"sang"run-jhun run-jhun" a breezing gust..." 

444
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:19,791
"into a radiant night..." 

445
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:24,041
"rode in fireflies on a palanquin of stars..." 

446
00:48:24,125 --> 00:48:29,541
"as the word played on stilled lips" 

447
00:48:29,625 --> 00:48:31,583
"Then to the cadence of drums and cymbals..." 

448
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:34,208
"the duffle was struck... then..." 

449
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:36,458
"into the rhythm swayed..." 

450
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:38,791
"my lovely Radha" 

451
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:44,041
"Into the rhythm Radha swayed" 

452
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:50,125
"Then he came from nowhere and he said... I love you" 

453
00:48:50,208 --> 00:48:53,291
"Dear love..." 

454
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,208
"oh but I'm afraid" 

455
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:03,458
"Dear love..." 

456
00:49:03,916 --> 00:49:08,333
"oh but I'm afraid" 

457
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000
"Oh dearest love" 

458
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:15,625
"No, not my wrist..." 

459
00:50:16,166 --> 00:50:20,666
"oh, how shameful" 

460
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:25,583
"Leave me..." 

461
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:30,541
"I beg of you" 

462
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:35,666
"No, don't force me..." 

463
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:37,791
"spare me" 

464
00:50:37,875 --> 00:50:40,500
"Dear love" 

465
00:50:40,583 --> 00:50:41,875
"No..." 

466
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:44,333
"I'll curse you for this" 

467
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,458
"Madman! Go away" 

468
00:50:46,541 --> 00:50:48,375
"Don't torment me" 

469
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:51,166
"Oh dearest love..." 

470
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,791
"dear love..." 

471
00:50:55,458 --> 00:50:59,833
"oh but I'm afraid" 

472
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:05,000
"Love me" 

473
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:09,666
"oh but I'm afraid" 

474
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:14,500
"Love me" 

475
00:51:17,416 --> 00:51:19,791
"On the banks of the Yamuna..." 

476
00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:22,333
"Krishna and Radha in the Dance of Love" 

477
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:27,041
"Krishna and Radha in the Dance of Love" 

478
00:51:27,208 --> 00:51:29,375
"Of desire in their hearts rose a song to their lips" 

479
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:31,750
"Krishna and Radha in the Dance of Love" 

480
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:36,375
"Krishna and Radha in the Dance of Love" 

481
00:51:36,458 --> 00:51:38,416
"Thirsting in every breath, searing passion in their hearts..." 

482
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,875
"Krishna and Radha in the Dance of Love" 

483
00:51:40,958 --> 00:51:45,125
"Krishna and Radha in the Dance of Love" 

484
00:51:45,208 --> 00:51:47,208
"The world looks at it in amazement" 

485
00:51:47,291 --> 00:51:50,041
"Krishna and Radha in the Dance of Love" 

486
00:51:50,125 --> 00:51:53,958
"Krishna and Radha in the Dance of Love" 

487
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,125
"Krishna and Radha in the Dance of Love" 

488
00:51:58,208 --> 00:52:02,708
"Krishna and Radha in the Dance of Love" 

489
00:52:10,416 --> 00:52:11,875
What is this? 

490
00:52:11,958 --> 00:52:14,041
The token of betrothal... 

491
00:52:14,958 --> 00:52:19,000
of my daughter to your son. Paro and Devdas 

492
00:52:23,666 --> 00:52:28,875
Are you in your senses, Sumitra? I invited mother and daughter... 

493
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:32,958
to entertain my guests with some melodrama 

494
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:35,666
Instead, you are out to work magic? 

495
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:43,541
Kumud, you were right! Sumitra-Kaki's timing is opportune 

496
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:47,666
She does knows how to take advantage of opportunity 

497
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:51,958
As a child, her daughter stole guavas from our orchards 

498
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:59,458
Now she sets her sights on my son? - No Didi, that isn't true 

499
00:53:00,166 --> 00:53:03,125
Devdas and Paro were childhood sweethearts 

500
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:06,125
They are in love, they can't live without each other 

501
00:53:06,208 --> 00:53:12,000
In a large family, maybe you never noticed. But I know how they yearn 

502
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:17,625
Please do not refuse Didi, even if it means... 

503
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:20,000
that you will have nothing more to do with me afterwards 

504
00:53:20,041 --> 00:53:26,375
Why draw water from poisoned wells? You may not betray the traits 

505
00:53:26,458 --> 00:53:29,041
But your genes remain the same, that of the dancing girls 

506
00:53:29,666 --> 00:53:32,250
Yes, we landlords eat fish... 

507
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:34,541
but we won't let bones stick in the gullet 

508
00:53:35,291 --> 00:53:38,041
For one, you are a neighbour. Worse, as a family, disgraced 

509
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:45,125
Even if you may momentarily forget your disgrace, but your standing? 

510
00:53:45,625 --> 00:53:48,875
Don't you try to palm off your bad coin 

511
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:55,250
Chhoto-Ma, let it pass Chhoto-Ma. We can always talk Dev out of it 

512
00:53:56,708 --> 00:54:03,166
Which leaves Parvati. If she can't contain herself, send her to Dev 

513
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:05,458
Honour among landlords isn't sullied by such affairs 

514
00:54:05,541 --> 00:54:12,000
Unbecoming of a landlord's woman! Don't interfere when elders speak 

515
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:17,333
Enough! Replying to you is beneath my dignity 

516
00:54:18,583 --> 00:54:24,416
My sister you were. From now on, merely Kaushalya 

517
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:30,833
And Kaushalya, you too sang the day my daughter was born 

518
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:35,375
Remember Badi-Ma? She took my daughter from my arms... 

519
00:54:35,458 --> 00:54:40,625
saying Paro was her daughter! With a smile, I had even said yes 

520
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:44,375
Little did I know that even in the big landlord's mansion... 

521
00:54:44,458 --> 00:54:48,125
a lady of the house could be so narrow-minded... 

522
00:54:48,208 --> 00:54:51,708
as to count guavas stolen from one of her orchards 

523
00:54:52,458 --> 00:54:57,416
Count, how many guavas did my daughter steal? Tell me 

524
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:01,791
Counting guavas? By the count of it... 

525
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:08,333
I've fed your son many more times than your count of stolen guava 

526
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:11,666
Stolen 

527
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:17,875
And the disgrace? Yes, we do sell our daughters 

528
00:55:17,958 --> 00:55:23,583
But you trade too, Kaushalya. We sell our daughters, openly 

529
00:55:23,666 --> 00:55:26,500
But you swallow the dowries and the daughters too 

530
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:35,125
Good or bad, the coin is known by it's tinkle. But you wouldn't know 

531
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:40,541
Because you're deaf enough not to know your son's heart 

532
00:55:41,166 --> 00:55:45,041
Blind you are, that you do not see their love 

533
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:50,666
Now soon you will stand dumbstruck in witness your son's ruination 

534
00:55:53,666 --> 00:56:00,958
I swear, my daughter will marry into a family richer than yours 

535
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:09,333
In a week. If I fail, then come, mourn my death on day eight 

536
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:14,750
I came to wish that you would beget a handsome son 

537
00:56:15,291 --> 00:56:22,625
But all I can wish is to see that a daughter you be given 

538
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:43,458
I hear your mother is giving you away... 

539
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:47,916
into a rich family. Do you know your husband's name? 

540
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:52,500
Devdas. - Even after all that happened... 

541
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:55,291
will Dev marry you? - I'll ask him and I'll tell you 

542
00:56:55,375 --> 00:57:00,958
Is there anything left to ask? She was insulted so gravely 

543
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,666
Dev didn't insult her, did he? - Will you walk up... 

544
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:08,125
to ask Dev to marry you? Won't that be embarrassing? 

545
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:11,875
Why be embarrassed about asking for what is yours? 

546
00:57:13,458 --> 00:57:21,000
You're married, yet you don't know what a husband means? 

547
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:52,750
Who...? - I 

548
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:23,000
Are you all right? 

549
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:26,458
So late at night? In the dark...? 

550
00:58:27,666 --> 00:58:32,666
Weren't you afraid? - No, now I'm afraid of no one 

551
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:40,000
Not even of being maligned? - No, when I am with you... 

552
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:42,375
I don't even care about getting a bad name 

553
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:48,458
Why... here... now...? - Why does the river head to sea? 

554
00:58:48,916 --> 00:58:51,458
Why does the sunflower always face the Sun? 

555
00:58:52,083 --> 00:58:54,625
And why comes Paro heedless of her dignity...? 

556
00:58:54,708 --> 00:58:58,291
Why unheeding my family honour do I venture out in dark of night? 

557
00:58:58,583 --> 00:59:04,166
Why do I seek refuge at your feet? To all questions, a single answer 

558
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:09,250
For the same reply, far too many questions asking to be answered 

559
00:59:09,625 --> 00:59:12,916
There are no questions, not as long as we're together 

560
00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:17,833
That's what they don't want. - What do you want? 

561
00:59:18,541 --> 00:59:20,541
Happiness, for you 

562
00:59:22,958 --> 00:59:26,375
But my father won't look at it from our perspective 

563
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:28,833
We'll win him over 

564
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,833
What if he doesn't relent? 

565
00:59:36,041 --> 00:59:41,416
Where there's love, there's no fear. - Where there's smoke there's fire 

566
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,958
In fires of attrition, I don't want us... 

567
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:50,500
to be consumed. - I'm doomed, in any case 

568
00:59:50,583 --> 00:59:52,916
Be it with you, or without you 

569
00:59:57,583 --> 01:00:01,458
Let me drop you home. - You're coming with me? 

570
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:05,791
Without fear of censure? 

571
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,666
Even the cur is wary of the door it's kicked out of 

572
01:00:26,875 --> 01:00:30,458
What you can't get away with by light of the day, you try by night? 

573
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:34,166
Why don't you, mother and daughter start a brothel? 

574
01:00:40,791 --> 01:00:44,875
Not even a pimp would advise his daughter to do that 

575
01:00:44,958 --> 01:00:46,291
Dev! 

576
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,541
Paro! 

577
01:00:57,166 --> 01:01:01,041
With the lamp, I saw you burn for Devdas 

578
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:08,291
I treasure your feelings. Were you to have asked me before leaving... 

579
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:12,750
I would not even mind if you were to have been whore for a night 

580
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:16,875
Ma, I just went to ask him! - And received what in reply? 

581
01:01:18,166 --> 01:01:24,291
Not alone, you carried with you, the honour of our family 

582
01:01:25,708 --> 01:01:29,416
Have you left your honour behind? 

583
01:01:32,166 --> 01:01:34,291
Let it pass, father. Why make... 

584
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:37,125
...a mountain out of a molehill? 

585
01:01:37,458 --> 01:01:40,875
By the way, what to do about Paro's shawl? 

586
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:45,416
Tell him to return it. This marriage isn't happening 

587
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,625
I shall do no such thing 

588
01:01:46,708 --> 01:01:48,500
Don't forget yourself, Dev! 

589
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:53,083
You forget whom you are addressing 

590
01:01:57,416 --> 01:02:01,291
A hot-headed landlord who will send his fellow-man's daughter... 

591
01:02:02,291 --> 01:02:05,708
to a brothel. - Gentlemen's daughters... 

592
01:02:05,791 --> 01:02:10,541
never steal out of neighbours' rooms at 2 am 

593
01:02:11,958 --> 01:02:16,458
So great was her compulsion and it was you who compelled her 

594
01:02:16,541 --> 01:02:21,875
I will brook no argument from you. - Nor do I wish to talk to you 

595
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:22,791
Fine! 

596
01:02:22,875 --> 01:02:24,083
It's decided 

597
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:25,583
Case is dismissed. 

598
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:28,625
I object. - Don't you realize... 

599
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:31,916
Our family ranks far higher than theirs 

600
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:34,250
I object. 

601
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:41,916
Yet, it's the same food we eat? - Our hierarchy, status, standing 

602
01:02:42,083 --> 01:02:44,750
Even the British government is informed of us 

603
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:46,166
I object. 

604
01:02:46,708 --> 01:02:50,291
Yet, the same soil we tread upon? - The bird that soars... 

605
01:02:50,375 --> 01:02:54,666
can never have any relationship with fish in the waters 

606
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:59,000
Yet, man on Earth relates to God in Heaven? 

607
01:02:59,083 --> 01:03:00,875
How dare you? 

608
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:06,416
I said I object. 

609
01:03:19,125 --> 01:03:21,208
Stop, Dev. Dev, stop. 

610
01:03:21,291 --> 01:03:24,291
Dev, everything can be resolved. I'll talk to Babu-ji 

611
01:03:24,708 --> 01:03:26,875
But don't leave the house. - No Dwij 

612
01:03:27,291 --> 01:03:29,041
Childishness! 

613
01:03:29,125 --> 01:03:31,583
Over something so trivial...? - Trivial for you, not for me 

614
01:03:31,666 --> 01:03:34,000
Not for me a life praying for every breath 

615
01:03:34,041 --> 01:03:37,375
Dev, we'll talk to Babu-ji... - Stop Dev 

616
01:03:37,458 --> 01:03:40,333
Dev stop. - Stop! Listen to me 

617
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:42,375
Stop him, Kumud. 

618
01:03:42,458 --> 01:03:43,458
Dev, listen to me. 

619
01:03:43,541 --> 01:03:46,791
You aren't going anywhere. Your mother is talking to the master 

620
01:03:46,875 --> 01:03:48,458
Everything will be fine. - No Dharamdas 

621
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:51,791
The tempest ought to pass. lf I stay on, much will be undone 

622
01:03:51,875 --> 01:03:53,291
Listen to me. 

623
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:54,625
Lady... 

624
01:03:54,708 --> 01:03:56,833
Dev is leaving, Paro 

625
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:02,458
It's as much his test as it is yours. See for yourself... 

626
01:04:02,958 --> 01:04:06,583
what he cares for, you or family? Is he taking you with him? 

627
01:04:06,666 --> 01:04:10,083
Or is he deserting you? lf he isn't taking you along... 

628
01:04:10,166 --> 01:04:13,208
then you shall do your mother's bidding 

629
01:04:15,166 --> 01:04:17,375
Stop Deva! I won't let you leave! 

630
01:04:17,458 --> 01:04:21,583
Stop. - Out of my way. 

631
01:04:43,041 --> 01:04:47,500
"That night, all sense of reasoning deserted me" 

632
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:50,458
"I was left vacillating as if between pendulous scales" 

633
01:04:51,333 --> 01:04:55,125
"You wouldn't want me to displease my father to make you happy..." 

634
01:04:56,041 --> 01:04:58,291
"would you?" 

635
01:04:59,166 --> 01:05:04,875
"Why does the river go to sea? Why the sunflower gazes at the sun?" 

636
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:11,166
"Instead of hunting answers, why not let the question pass?" 

637
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:17,583
"What was between us, was no more than childishness. There's no love" 

638
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:20,666
"From now onwards, you are the girl next-door" 

639
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,375
"And I, your friend" 

640
01:05:23,458 --> 01:05:29,375
Paro, get dressed, come downstairs. Hurry. Your in-laws are here 

641
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:44,291
"My love! Oh why did you leave me smouldering?" 

642
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:47,666
"Why did you snub out the flame?" 

643
01:05:52,166 --> 01:05:55,083
Ei Dev... 

644
01:05:55,875 --> 01:06:04,083
Friend, you aren't asleep yet? Are you a stranger in my home? 

645
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:10,333
I told you before, this is as much your home as it's mine 

646
01:06:10,666 --> 01:06:14,666
Nothing of the sort, Chuni Babu. I'm just not feeling sleepy 

647
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:19,208
Drink up... 

648
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:25,500
You know I don't drink. - Then what gives? 

649
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:29,958
If "h" is for happiness in life, why are you so looking so harassed? 

650
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,458
So harried as not to feel at home? - Nothing of the sort 

651
01:06:35,541 --> 01:06:37,375
But something surely is! 

652
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:40,750
The "h" that makes a home is the same that spells hurt 

653
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:43,875
Fought with your parents? - No 

654
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:47,458
Or are you nursing a wounded heart? 

655
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:57,708
My point! That's my point! "H" for heart and for hurt 

656
01:06:57,791 --> 01:07:00,791
And the two are related so closely my friend, oh-so-closely 

657
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:03,875
Hindustan or English-stan, everywhere it's all the same 

658
01:07:04,041 --> 01:07:11,041
"H" for heart and for hurt. - Have you suffered no pain? 

659
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:15,875
Ask not of one Time has weathered what pain each nuance hides... 

660
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:19,875
for men may see but no more than a smiling face 

661
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:25,458
You know what I make family with. Just me and my wealth 

662
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:29,291
And therefore it was that I adopted music 

663
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:35,208
The "Thumri" for my daughter, and the "Dadra", my son 

664
01:07:37,041 --> 01:07:42,000
The "w" in words is tricky, making for warmth... 

665
01:07:42,083 --> 01:07:45,625
...worn, wealth, worlds, wisdom... 

666
01:07:45,708 --> 01:07:55,458
wastrels and wishes. Worship too. A well-wisher and your waywardness 

667
01:07:57,458 --> 01:08:05,291
Get over this insanity and let's go away. Way away. I feel walled-in 

668
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:15,416
But Chuni Babu, where to? - Wherever you wish 

669
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,750
Where you go every night 

670
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:25,333
There, where the anklets tinkle? 

671
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:06,000
How are you ladies? Look, whom I've brought to you 

672
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:10,750
Who is it? - My classmate from London 

673
01:09:10,833 --> 01:09:16,000
Where are you lost Dev Babu? Come, here too I hold court 

674
01:09:16,041 --> 01:09:18,875
Welcome my friend, enter 

675
01:10:00,666 --> 01:10:01,833
Chandramukhi 

676
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:09,083
Your mirror couldn't bear to see my face. I'm sorry for your loss 

677
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:17,958
If sorrow be joy's harbinger, every loss signals what gain shall be? 

678
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:25,583
Wonderful Chandramukhi! Even your words are so seductive 

679
01:10:25,666 --> 01:10:31,666
But do use the kohl, to ward off the stranger's evil eye 

680
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,250
You are much amused? - Naturally 

681
01:10:37,541 --> 01:10:40,000
I see someone trying to ward off the evil eye... 

682
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:42,583
while women on the marketplace... 

683
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:46,500
vie to be seen 

684
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:53,333
You touch upon eyespeak and you have stolen my heart 

685
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:58,333
What I took for stone, breathes the life into me 

686
01:11:00,833 --> 01:11:04,625
So you see Dev Babu? On "c" and Chandramukhi... 

687
01:11:04,708 --> 01:11:06,833
didn't I warn you she's cause of such amazement? 

688
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:10,375
Chuni Babu also begins with a "c" 

689
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,750
Of c's and cause celebres and Chandramukhi... 

690
01:11:16,833 --> 01:11:21,666
you saw how clumsy she made me look? 

691
01:11:48,833 --> 01:11:52,375
"Jasmine makes fragrant..." 

692
01:11:52,458 --> 01:11:56,166
"her lovely dark tresses" 

693
01:11:56,875 --> 01:12:00,000
"Jasmine makes fragrant..." 

694
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:04,083
"her lovely dark tresses" 

695
01:12:04,458 --> 01:12:08,750
"Radha's face is aglow, electric" 

696
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:12,333
"Her gait, seductive" 

697
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,708
"Her gait, seductive" 

698
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:20,000
"Her gait, seductive" 

699
01:12:54,958 --> 01:13:00,875
"Krishna stopped her" 

700
01:13:00,958 --> 01:13:03,125
"He surprised Radha with a kiss" 

701
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:05,125
"Surprised Radha with a kiss..." 

702
01:13:05,208 --> 01:13:06,583
"with a kiss" 

703
01:13:06,666 --> 01:13:12,500
"Radha's veil was slipping away" 

704
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:25,708
"Do not tease me, Radha pleaded" 

705
01:13:25,791 --> 01:13:33,833
"Do not tease me, Radha pleaded" 

706
01:13:33,916 --> 01:13:38,375
"Why are you teasing me?" 

707
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:45,750
"But Krishna was obstinate" 

708
01:13:45,833 --> 01:13:49,625
"But Krishna was obstinate"But Krishna was obstinate" 

709
01:13:49,708 --> 01:13:57,041
"He shamed Radha" 

710
01:13:57,125 --> 01:14:01,041
"He shamed Radha" 

711
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:04,916
"That night, Krishna wouldn't listen" 

712
01:14:05,166 --> 01:14:08,666
"That night, Krishna wouldn't listen" 

713
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:16,750
"But whom could Radha complain to? Krishna wouldn't listen" 

714
01:14:16,833 --> 01:14:20,416
"Oh, why are you teasing me?" 

715
01:14:43,666 --> 01:14:48,750
"A pot of milk..." 

716
01:14:48,833 --> 01:14:51,375
"Radha carried on her head..." 

717
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:53,250
"when she heard..." 

718
01:14:53,333 --> 01:14:54,708
"Krishna's footsteps..." 

719
01:14:54,916 --> 01:14:56,750
"and her heart..." 

720
01:14:56,833 --> 01:15:02,083
"skipped a beat" 

721
01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:06,666
"Oh stop teasing me" 

722
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:18,791
"Radha pleaded, don't hold my arms so hard, then her bangles broke" 

723
01:15:18,875 --> 01:15:25,916
"Radha pleaded, don't hold my arms so hard, then her bangles broke" 

724
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:40,750
"But that night..." 

725
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:45,583
"whom could Radha complain to? Krishna wouldn't listen" 

726
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:55,125
"Oh stop teasing me" 

727
01:16:35,583 --> 01:16:38,375
Mesmeric 

728
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:45,583
Where are you off to? Tarry, the night has just come of age 

729
01:16:45,666 --> 01:16:51,291
I made a big mistake! I shouldn't have written that letter to Paro 

730
01:16:53,125 --> 01:16:59,291
I want to go to Paro. - Who's Paro? Wait, wait for me 

731
01:17:01,833 --> 01:17:04,250
Bad manners, walking out on a performance 

732
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:06,666
Dancing to an audience of drunken men... 

733
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:09,791
is shamelessness 

734
01:17:14,083 --> 01:17:18,125
You are a woman, Chandramukhi. Realise who you are 

735
01:17:18,791 --> 01:17:23,208
Woman, mother, sister, wife, friend 

736
01:17:24,083 --> 01:17:25,708
When she is none... 

737
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:27,791
she is whore 

738
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:31,333
Could you be some else, Chandramukhi? 

739
01:17:35,166 --> 01:17:36,833
Price. For our time together 

740
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Keep it 

741
01:17:44,583 --> 01:17:46,791
Friend... 

742
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:52,000
See? Someone I wanted to stay on, is gone 

743
01:17:54,833 --> 01:18:00,291
In what are you lost? - Such anguish in those eyes 

744
01:18:02,625 --> 01:18:06,875
Does anguish make you anxious? 

745
01:18:08,458 --> 01:18:14,041
Have courtesans no hearts? Is she denied the right to love? 

746
01:18:14,125 --> 01:18:18,708
Of course! If there be amour, paramour there is too 

747
01:18:19,166 --> 01:18:21,750
Will you do me a favour? - Say it 

748
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,666
For just once, will you bring him? 

749
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:30,666
Promise, I cannot. But try, I shall. Only for you 

750
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:36,958
Look at her! Paro is as resplendent as the Moon tonight 

751
01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:44,625
Had Devdas been here, he'd know what he has lost 

752
01:18:44,708 --> 01:18:46,750
My Paro is lucky 

753
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:48,833
Her wedding procession is coming all the way from Manikpur... 

754
01:18:48,916 --> 01:18:51,541
like a train of lights. - You haven't seen it 

755
01:18:51,833 --> 01:18:55,250
The bride's mother must not watch her daughter's wedding procession 

756
01:18:55,333 --> 01:18:57,791
Lest the mother gives the bride the evil eye 

757
01:18:58,208 --> 01:19:02,750
And after tonight no one will ever call her Paro 

758
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:05,666
Just Parvati 

759
01:19:06,083 --> 01:19:08,083
Kaki-Ma (Kaki Ma: Aunt) 

760
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:11,291
Is Paro in? 

761
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,416
The wedding procession is about to arrive 

762
01:19:20,333 --> 01:19:23,875
You can see her. Let's go, Manorama 

763
01:19:32,541 --> 01:19:33,708
I'm back Paro 

764
01:19:35,833 --> 01:19:39,166
Why? - I've come back to you. Forever 

765
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:42,291
When my wedding procession is at my door? 

766
01:19:44,208 --> 01:19:49,291
There's still time. I'll convince my parents. I'll tell them... 

767
01:19:50,625 --> 01:19:56,583
Your parents! Haven't I...? If honour matters to your family... 

768
01:19:57,041 --> 01:20:00,625
...doesn't honour matter to us? Your father may be a landlord 

769
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:06,791
Doesn't my father count? No matter how lowly we bride-sellers are... 

770
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:11,000
we never cheat anyone. - I never cheated you, Paro 

771
01:20:11,291 --> 01:20:14,875
Then why did you leave me? And that letter? 

772
01:20:14,958 --> 01:20:18,583
Paro you know, your Dev never does anything deliberately 

773
01:20:20,958 --> 01:20:22,000
I was naive 

774
01:20:22,916 --> 01:20:28,750
Naivete! How naive can you be Dev? On a whim, you give me a bracelet? 

775
01:20:28,833 --> 01:20:32,375
On a whim, you write saying there's no love lost! Naivete? 

776
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:37,875
"Paro forever"...another whim? - Paro! Your wedding procession 

777
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:42,666
Time to part 

778
01:20:44,666 --> 01:20:47,875
I don't accept this marriage! - What difference? I accept 

779
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:55,583
Then, I'm going to tell everyone... - I went to see you at 2 am 

780
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:59,750
You want to malign me? - I... malign you? 

781
01:21:00,458 --> 01:21:03,500
How could you think? If you ever say that again... 

782
01:21:03,583 --> 01:21:06,708
What will you do? Hit me? Ever since I was a child... 

783
01:21:06,791 --> 01:21:10,750
have you held me in fief? And when I ask for my right... 

784
01:21:10,833 --> 01:21:14,458
you do a volte face? - Enough! Stop it Paro 

785
01:21:16,208 --> 01:21:19,958
Such vanity is no good. - Why should I not be vain? 

786
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,166
What are you Dev, but wealthy and handsome? 

787
01:21:24,666 --> 01:21:29,375
I possess virtues, beauty. And after tonight, riches too 

788
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,208
From now on, I am more than an equal to you 

789
01:21:32,666 --> 01:21:36,916
If you be a landlord, I take pride in being an aristocrat 

790
01:21:43,666 --> 01:21:45,500
Such vanity? 

791
01:21:46,166 --> 01:21:52,541
Not even the Moon is as vain. - But the Moon is scarred 

792
01:22:09,208 --> 01:22:10,708
What have you done? 

793
01:22:13,166 --> 01:22:20,000
I have scarred you, like the Moon. With the mark of my love 

794
01:22:54,833 --> 01:23:00,416
"On joyous night..." 

795
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:07,125
"when her bridal procession arrived..." 

796
01:23:07,208 --> 01:23:10,708
"slowly, a sea of sorrow..." 

797
01:23:10,791 --> 01:23:14,000
"rose, stilled in her eyes" 

798
01:23:14,083 --> 01:23:16,833
"To lilting lutes..." 

799
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:24,208
"her eyes told the tale" 

800
01:23:28,916 --> 01:23:32,125
"Always, it was you I loved..." 

801
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:35,583
"and I loved and I loved..." 

802
01:23:35,666 --> 01:23:39,875
"and I loved forever" 

803
01:23:44,375 --> 01:23:52,750
"Forever I have longed for you as I have longed for nothing else" 

804
01:23:54,541 --> 01:23:57,750
"My heart has worshipped you..." 

805
01:23:57,833 --> 01:24:01,291
"worshipped you and worshipped..." 

806
01:24:01,375 --> 01:24:05,583
"and worshipped but none else" 

807
01:24:05,833 --> 01:24:09,000
"Never..." 

808
01:24:09,041 --> 01:24:14,041
"never, never, never..." 

809
01:24:14,125 --> 01:24:16,208
"and none else" 

810
01:24:16,833 --> 01:24:19,500
"and none else" 

811
01:24:20,916 --> 01:24:24,000
"and none else" 

812
01:25:00,125 --> 01:25:03,416
"Sorrow clouds a joy..." 

813
01:25:03,708 --> 01:25:06,833
"shades of anguish darken her..." 

814
01:25:06,916 --> 01:25:10,250
"as she goes to tell her beloved..." 

815
01:25:10,416 --> 01:25:13,750
"only to tell her beloved" 

816
01:25:16,791 --> 01:25:23,541
"The wound you have left me with..." 

817
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:30,416
"only adds to my beauty" 

818
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:37,333
"My wound I will preserve as your mark..." 

819
01:25:37,416 --> 01:25:44,291
"that anoints my forehead" 

820
01:25:44,375 --> 01:25:45,750
"My beloved..." 

821
01:25:45,833 --> 01:25:47,708
"oh beloved..." 

822
01:25:47,791 --> 01:25:49,416
"without you..." 

823
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:52,000
"my life is incomplete..." 

824
01:25:52,041 --> 01:25:53,750
"vacuous..." 

825
01:25:53,833 --> 01:25:55,791
"empty..." 

826
01:25:57,208 --> 01:26:00,208
"my life is empty..." 

827
01:26:12,166 --> 01:26:15,333
"Carrying memories of moments past..." 

828
01:26:15,625 --> 01:26:18,958
"with burdened steps she walks..." 

829
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,666
"her heart cries..." 

830
01:26:22,041 --> 01:26:25,166
"her eyes weep..." 

831
01:26:25,375 --> 01:26:28,750
"her heart..." 

832
01:26:28,833 --> 01:26:31,833
"resonates" 

833
01:26:32,291 --> 01:26:37,208
"Childhood memories..." 

834
01:26:39,208 --> 01:26:41,750
"of relationships..." 

835
01:26:41,833 --> 01:26:45,583
"swinging in the rain..." 

836
01:26:45,666 --> 01:26:47,625
"smiling..." 

837
01:26:47,708 --> 01:26:49,208
"drawing laughter..." 

838
01:26:49,291 --> 01:26:52,750
"annoyed, being placated" 

839
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:56,041
"Every moment..." 

840
01:26:56,375 --> 01:26:57,958
"etched into my heart..." 

841
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,125
"in the flames of my lamp..." 

842
01:27:00,208 --> 01:27:03,291
"I am carrying..." 

843
01:27:03,375 --> 01:27:06,708
"away" 

844
01:27:06,791 --> 01:27:09,958
"away" 

845
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,416
"My beloved..." 

846
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:15,000
"without you..." 

847
01:27:15,041 --> 01:27:21,958
"my life is nothing..." 

848
01:27:22,833 --> 01:27:25,291
"nothing at all" 

849
01:27:30,958 --> 01:27:34,125
"Always, you I loved..." 

850
01:27:34,208 --> 01:27:37,666
"and I loved and I loved..." 

851
01:27:41,041 --> 01:27:46,000
"and I loved forever" 

852
01:27:47,916 --> 01:27:51,791
"I loved, loved, loved" 

853
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:58,666
"You, I loved and loved" 

854
01:28:01,416 --> 01:28:05,583
"I loved and loved" 

855
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:11,916
"Only loved and loved and loved" 

856
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:20,416
"Only loved and loved and loved" 

857
01:28:22,208 --> 01:28:25,625
"Only loved and loved and loved" 

858
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:33,250
Deva! Open up! What are you doing? 

859
01:28:33,333 --> 01:28:39,750
Open up! What madness is this? - For my sake! Open up 

860
01:28:39,833 --> 01:28:44,250
I said it! Don't tear Deva and Paro apart! But who listens to me? 

861
01:28:44,333 --> 01:28:46,958
What's going on? - Look! Tell him something 

862
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:51,458
Narayan, tell him. - No point. Leave him alone 

863
01:28:51,541 --> 01:28:54,500
The fire will die down on its own. - But look... 

864
01:29:00,375 --> 01:29:02,333
Kaushalya! 

865
01:29:03,833 --> 01:29:06,750
Time plays games with everyone 

866
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,208
My daughter treads upon silver now! But look... 

867
01:29:12,291 --> 01:29:16,375
Iook at your son. It's your pride that he sets afire 

868
01:29:16,458 --> 01:29:19,583
Two acts to the melodrama! 

869
01:29:19,666 --> 01:29:22,750
In Act One my daughter and I danced 

870
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,833
Act Two Now you and your son will dance 

871
01:29:52,125 --> 01:29:55,750
Why is the new bride so dejected? - Because last night... 

872
01:29:55,833 --> 01:29:58,666
husband and bride slept apart. - That's for the first night 

873
01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:01,125
It's said to be ominous. But it's over 

874
01:30:01,208 --> 01:30:03,875
From tonight, man and wife will sleep together 

875
01:30:06,333 --> 01:30:08,333
Are you harassing the bride? 

876
01:30:08,625 --> 01:30:10,333
Sit... sit Parvati 

877
01:30:11,333 --> 01:30:19,750
You know, we had everything here, but the Moon. And now you're here 

878
01:30:19,833 --> 01:30:22,375
Now you are the lady of the manor 

879
01:30:22,916 --> 01:30:24,458
Also a mother to these children 

880
01:30:26,958 --> 01:30:29,083
From his first wife, Bhuvan has three children 

881
01:30:29,833 --> 01:30:33,500
Your son, Mahendra. - Obeisances, Chhoti-Ma 

882
01:30:34,083 --> 01:30:38,625
And our youngest, little Kalika. - My obeisances, Chhoti-Ma 

883
01:30:38,708 --> 01:30:40,666
And Yashomati, the eldest 

884
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:46,000
She's angry. You must placate her 

885
01:30:46,416 --> 01:30:47,958
And all of you... 

886
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,458
you must adorn the bride exquisitely... 

887
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,500
for her nuptial night 

888
01:30:57,791 --> 01:30:59,666
Have you familiarised yourself with the manor? 

889
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,666
Yes. - You have my word, Parvati... 

890
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:07,875
in this manor, you will have no problems about anything 

891
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:09,458
Except one 

892
01:31:10,958 --> 01:31:15,416
It is difficult to bide time here. - Oh but time flies here 

893
01:31:15,666 --> 01:31:22,125
I do not understand...? - A while ago I was a new bride 

894
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:25,500
And in no time, I'm Chhoti-Ma (Chhoti-Ma: little Mother) 

895
01:31:26,333 --> 01:31:30,541
From bride to "little Mother", I'm transformed. In no time 

896
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:35,791
I wish to tell you something. I married because my Ma insisted 

897
01:31:36,666 --> 01:31:41,083
My children needed a mother, and this manor needs a lady 

898
01:31:42,875 --> 01:31:44,583
And you...? 

899
01:31:45,625 --> 01:31:50,666
Subhadra... was my first wife 

900
01:31:52,041 --> 01:31:55,291
You're now the lady of the manor, the mother of my children... 

901
01:31:55,916 --> 01:32:01,333
and my new bride, no doubt. But Subhadra, I can never forget 

902
01:32:01,916 --> 01:32:07,541
The ominous first night may be over. But we will stay distanced, forever 

903
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,625
My mistake or my sin, call it what you may... 

904
01:32:13,666 --> 01:32:15,666
but do forgive me 

905
01:32:30,833 --> 01:32:34,750
Good morning friend, good morning. You're lucky, my friend 

906
01:32:34,833 --> 01:32:37,958
I ask help of the spirits to knock me out of my senses 

907
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,333
You won't even touch the spirits and yet you are inebriated? 

908
01:32:42,791 --> 01:32:48,583
You missed telling me? Or made a pariah of me? Paro and paramour 

909
01:32:48,666 --> 01:32:55,500
Both spelt with "p"! Your stupor has unravelled all your secrets 

910
01:32:55,833 --> 01:32:57,750
Who brought me here? 

911
01:32:58,125 --> 01:33:05,541
"My lover is so faithless" 

912
01:33:05,625 --> 01:33:10,625
How regrettable, to be rescued off the streets by a prostitute 

913
01:33:10,875 --> 01:33:12,250
Oh, my! 

914
01:33:13,333 --> 01:33:18,916
This one is an ingrate Chuni Babu! Bites me for the love I gave him 

915
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:23,958
My word! She helped you out of humane concern. You were sick 

916
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,833
She picked you up from the streets. You've come to, after two days 

917
01:33:29,083 --> 01:33:34,416
She never slept a wink, nursed you, sat through your cries for Paro 

918
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:37,875
Insult instead of gratitude? 

919
01:33:37,958 --> 01:33:45,083
Let it pass. It's a landlord trait. Never mind their little trespasses 

920
01:33:46,125 --> 01:33:51,125
You left as if, forever. But as luck would have it... 

921
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:55,000
I find you once again. Medicine... 

922
01:33:55,833 --> 01:33:57,333
you need it. Now 

923
01:34:00,125 --> 01:34:03,750
Your medicine, I don't need. I'd rather have lain there 

924
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:09,750
Just fall unconscious once again. I'll dump you where I found you 

925
01:34:09,833 --> 01:34:11,000
Yes Chuni Babu? 

926
01:34:16,583 --> 01:34:18,250
What is this? - Chuni Babu says... 

927
01:34:18,333 --> 01:34:22,958
you've been here for two nights. Lamps in your boudoir went unlit 

928
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:26,666
This is price. For two nights you wasted on me 

929
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:35,666
Now I know, why Paro abandoned you 

930
01:34:36,833 --> 01:34:40,583
Let alone love, you don't even deserve sympathy 

931
01:34:42,416 --> 01:34:46,125
Hear Chuni Babu? A courtesan talking of romance 

932
01:34:46,833 --> 01:34:51,958
Am I to learn of her what love is, what romance be? What is amour? 

933
01:34:52,291 --> 01:35:00,416
Love mirrored in your soul, amour God's gift to life's design, romance 

934
01:35:01,208 --> 01:35:06,208
How regrettable Chuni Babu Your friend possesses none... 

935
01:35:06,666 --> 01:35:09,416
of soul, or intent or purpose 

936
01:35:10,333 --> 01:35:13,833
That thing you flash time and again Dev Babu... 

937
01:35:14,666 --> 01:35:17,208
the money, it lies at the feet of harlots in brothels 

938
01:35:18,375 --> 01:35:23,833
If you be so vain, return to me what I spent on you 

939
01:35:24,958 --> 01:35:26,666
Two nights 

940
01:35:26,958 --> 01:35:31,875
You owe me 2 nights, Dev Babu. No more shall I dance... 

941
01:35:31,958 --> 01:35:37,333
not until you come. These eyes will await you 

942
01:35:40,708 --> 01:35:49,291
"F" for friendship, she came seeking, you found a foe. You owe two nights 

943
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:56,083
O'faithless lover 

944
01:36:01,541 --> 01:36:03,666
Music plays 

945
01:36:04,541 --> 01:36:06,166
Let slip the veil 

946
01:36:09,041 --> 01:36:10,583
Let the revelry begin 

947
01:36:11,833 --> 01:36:20,458
Revelry awaits you, Chandramukhi. - No, not until Dev Babu arrives 

948
01:36:23,458 --> 01:36:27,291
Pure gold. Custom made, in Lucknow 

949
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,958
I also have a gold nose ring 

950
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:33,875
I wish to tie the dancing bells to your feet 

951
01:36:35,208 --> 01:36:38,083
Do wear the nose ring and allow me to unscrew it afterwards 

952
01:36:38,291 --> 01:36:44,208
Desist from such ardour Kali Babu. Get too close and you will burn... 

953
01:36:44,958 --> 01:36:47,333
in the very lamps that light up nights of revelry 

954
01:36:48,291 --> 01:36:52,875
At the next instance of insolence I'll give you a nose ring and... 

955
01:36:53,333 --> 01:36:56,125
the rest of the revelers may take pleasure in unscrewing 

956
01:36:56,208 --> 01:36:59,750
In a marketplace full of beauties... 

957
01:37:00,208 --> 01:37:02,458
such spirit is what draws me to you 

958
01:37:03,333 --> 01:37:05,583
But the one you await so eagerly... 

959
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:11,125
has no interest in you or your music 

960
01:37:12,458 --> 01:37:19,000
It was some Paro's firefly that ran into your fires crying Paro-Paro 

961
01:37:19,833 --> 01:37:26,333
Never will he return, Chandramukhi. - He will come, he will Kali Babu 

962
01:37:27,958 --> 01:37:34,458
You will see. That's from my heart. - Why not take on a bet? 

963
01:37:36,291 --> 01:37:38,583
If he doesn't come before the candle has burnt out... 

964
01:37:39,458 --> 01:37:42,166
then you will wear these dancing bells... 

965
01:37:42,875 --> 01:37:46,083
only for my pleasure. - I accept 

966
01:37:48,666 --> 01:37:50,083
And if he comes... 

967
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:57,375
then you shall leave wearing these very dancing bells 

968
01:38:02,083 --> 01:38:03,250
Agreed 

969
01:38:33,541 --> 01:38:35,791
"Whose footfall?" 

970
01:38:36,750 --> 01:38:39,208
"Whose shadow?" 

971
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,541
"Who knocks at my heart?" 

972
01:38:43,208 --> 01:38:45,958
"Who is come?" 

973
01:38:50,833 --> 01:38:56,333
"Who paints me this emerald?" 

974
01:38:56,583 --> 01:39:03,041
"Who paints me this emerald?" 

975
01:39:03,541 --> 01:39:08,791
"My joy..." 

976
01:39:09,541 --> 01:39:14,541
"is killing me" 

977
01:39:15,875 --> 01:39:17,750
"is killing me" 

978
01:39:18,041 --> 01:39:21,458
"is killing me" 

979
01:39:22,791 --> 01:39:25,708
"Who paints me this emerald?" 

980
01:39:25,791 --> 01:39:28,958
"My joy is killing me" 

981
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,291
"is killing me" 

982
01:39:32,375 --> 01:39:35,083
"is killing me" 

983
01:39:35,166 --> 01:39:36,916
"is killing me" 

984
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,375
"Oh God" 

985
01:39:38,458 --> 01:39:40,083
"is killing me" 

986
01:39:40,166 --> 01:39:41,375
"Oh God" 

987
01:39:41,458 --> 01:39:42,666
"is killing me" 

988
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:44,208
"Oh God" 

989
01:39:44,291 --> 01:39:46,458
"is killing me" 

990
01:40:12,083 --> 01:40:20,083
"No Moon I ever desired..." 

991
01:40:21,666 --> 01:40:26,500
"nor stars I ever seeked..." 

992
01:40:26,583 --> 01:40:29,916
"complaints I have none..." 

993
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,916
"complaints I have none..." 

994
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,833
"every sorrow I have hidden..." 

995
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:42,041
"every taunt I laughed off..." 

996
01:40:42,875 --> 01:40:48,791
"thorns I embraced..." 

997
01:40:48,875 --> 01:40:55,000
"their blossoms have wounded me" 

998
01:40:55,708 --> 01:41:01,583
"But whenever I have prayed..." 

999
01:41:01,666 --> 01:41:08,416
"But whenever I have prayed..." 

1000
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:13,916
"of The Lord..." 

1001
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:19,208
"I have always seeked you" 

1002
01:41:19,291 --> 01:41:22,500
"I have always seeked you" 

1003
01:41:22,583 --> 01:41:26,000
"I have always seeked you" 

1004
01:41:27,625 --> 01:41:30,791
"Who paints me this emerald?" 

1005
01:41:30,875 --> 01:41:34,041
"is killing me" 

1006
01:41:34,125 --> 01:41:39,250
"I'm slain" 

1007
01:41:40,083 --> 01:41:42,083
"is killing me" 

1008
01:41:42,791 --> 01:41:45,250
"is killing me" 

1009
01:41:46,083 --> 01:41:48,166
"is killing me" 

1010
01:41:49,375 --> 01:41:51,791
"is killing me" 

1011
01:41:52,666 --> 01:41:55,958
"is killing me" 

1012
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,125
"is killing me" 

1013
01:41:59,208 --> 01:42:01,916
"is killing me" 

1014
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,291
"is killing me" 

1015
01:42:05,666 --> 01:42:07,625
"is killing me" 

1016
01:42:08,791 --> 01:42:10,875
"is killing me" 

1017
01:42:11,625 --> 01:42:14,250
"is killing me" 

1018
01:42:15,041 --> 01:42:17,291
"is killing me" 

1019
01:43:11,875 --> 01:43:15,375
"is killing me" 

1020
01:43:15,791 --> 01:43:21,625
You aren't accustomed to the drink. Why drink beyond your limits? 

1021
01:43:24,708 --> 01:43:27,833
What fool drinks to stay within limits? 

1022
01:43:29,375 --> 01:43:32,041
I drink that I may force myself to stay on... 

1023
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:39,708
Iooking at you, tolerating you... 

1024
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:44,125
that I may lose my senses, to help me forget Paro 

1025
01:43:44,583 --> 01:43:45,750
But Chandramukhi... 

1026
01:43:45,833 --> 01:43:48,583
such are memories of Paro, they won't even let me lose my senses 

1027
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:56,625
Why, after all I drink, do memories of her haunt me day and night? 

1028
01:43:57,916 --> 01:43:59,250
Why... 

1029
01:44:01,166 --> 01:44:02,500
oh why? 

1030
01:44:06,083 --> 01:44:08,583
Why, does man become so naive? 

1031
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,083
Why make mistakes? 

1032
01:44:14,583 --> 01:44:19,750
Why... for foible... so harsh a punishment? 

1033
01:44:20,708 --> 01:44:24,708
As to be rent asunder? 

1034
01:44:26,625 --> 01:44:31,541
One enters matrimony, and the other...? 

1035
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,916
Slain 

1036
01:44:58,208 --> 01:45:01,208
In what fain folly... 

1037
01:45:01,291 --> 01:45:03,291
he forsakes the lotus...? 

1038
01:45:03,875 --> 01:45:06,041
For a paper flower? 

1039
01:45:09,833 --> 01:45:10,958
Mr. Dev... 

1040
01:45:11,208 --> 01:45:12,958
I fall... 

1041
01:45:15,791 --> 01:45:16,875
Mr. Dev! 

1042
01:45:16,958 --> 01:45:20,541
Touch me not! I despise you! 

1043
01:45:21,625 --> 01:45:25,375
I can't bear to see woman come to this. Begone 

1044
01:45:28,541 --> 01:45:32,625
Never again shall I stand at this door 

1045
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:37,125
But yes, whenever I come to think of Paro, I shall 

1046
01:45:38,041 --> 01:45:41,833
And come the guilt pangs, I shall come 

1047
01:45:44,166 --> 01:45:47,416
For where else can I go? 

1048
01:45:49,875 --> 01:45:54,750
There... I have sentenced myself. - Why punish yourself so? 

1049
01:45:56,291 --> 01:45:59,583
Because every day, my heart is put to trial 

1050
01:46:03,291 --> 01:46:05,250
My Lord! 

1051
01:46:06,958 --> 01:46:09,000
My Lord! 

1052
01:46:09,666 --> 01:46:11,583
My Lord! 

1053
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,416
Every day, this romance is tried 

1054
01:46:16,250 --> 01:46:18,666
I... I object. I... I... 

1055
01:46:19,041 --> 01:46:22,333
But every day, the verdict is the same 

1056
01:46:23,291 --> 01:46:26,750
Son of Narayan Mukerjee... I... I... I... I... I object. 

1057
01:46:26,833 --> 01:46:29,458
I object. Objection overruled! 

1058
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,458
Alias Devdas Mukerjee. I... I... I... I object. 

1059
01:46:32,541 --> 01:46:33,958
Objection overruled! 

1060
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,708
You are convicted 

1061
01:46:35,791 --> 01:46:37,541
You are guilty! 

1062
01:46:37,625 --> 01:46:40,333
And you will drink till death. 

1063
01:46:45,291 --> 01:46:46,625
Yes, My Lord!. 

1064
01:46:50,958 --> 01:46:52,958
No objection, My Lord!. 

1065
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:55,875
No... 

1066
01:46:58,958 --> 01:47:01,791
No...No obj... 

1067
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:12,875
Hey Deva! 

1068
01:47:14,708 --> 01:47:16,083
Paro 

1069
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:24,916
Our Parvati decides whatever happens in the manor 

1070
01:47:25,208 --> 01:47:29,666
The new bride has laid to rest all my worries 

1071
01:47:30,041 --> 01:47:33,833
With Parvati's arrival our lost days of joys are here again 

1072
01:47:34,833 --> 01:47:39,625
Meet Yashomati's mother-in-law. This is Parvati 

1073
01:47:39,916 --> 01:47:42,083
To Bhuvan Chaudhary, you'd more likely be... 

1074
01:47:42,791 --> 01:47:46,625
a daughter than his wife. - Whatever I am to him... 

1075
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:52,166
you and I are like sisters. We should be embracing each other 

1076
01:47:52,250 --> 01:47:55,458
But you are many years my elder 

1077
01:47:55,708 --> 01:48:01,541
From what I see, in Manikpur, wives are better endowed than daughters 

1078
01:48:01,916 --> 01:48:05,125
No Badi-Ma? - Our daughters, we send away... 

1079
01:48:05,208 --> 01:48:12,625
in hope that they will be cared for, but we're disappointed. No, Badi-Ma? 

1080
01:48:14,625 --> 01:48:18,458
Yashomati. I was eager to meet you 

1081
01:48:18,541 --> 01:48:23,625
We ought not to be cross with kin. You and I are of the same age 

1082
01:48:23,708 --> 01:48:26,375
So you decide, how we will relate to each other 

1083
01:48:27,083 --> 01:48:29,458
Mother and daughter? Or friends? 

1084
01:48:31,416 --> 01:48:32,708
Ma 

1085
01:48:37,541 --> 01:48:42,333
What's this, Ma? All this...? - Gifts, from your Ma 

1086
01:48:43,083 --> 01:48:44,833
You'll look great 

1087
01:48:44,916 --> 01:48:46,250
Parvati, 

1088
01:48:46,708 --> 01:48:50,791
Will you keep to your daughter? Won't you give us company? 

1089
01:48:50,875 --> 01:48:56,916
I do not like the smoking pot. - The smoking pot has pride of place 

1090
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:01,416
I don't think so, no pride in what goes up in smoke 

1091
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:05,416
Wonderful, mother-in-law! I delight in your words 

1092
01:49:06,083 --> 01:49:11,083
I have been so eager to see you. We missed each other's weddings 

1093
01:49:11,708 --> 01:49:13,083
My obeisances 

1094
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:22,583
Touching your feet was a pleasure. I have been given my wish 

1095
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,000
How I wish I had attended your wedding... 

1096
01:49:27,083 --> 01:49:30,625
if only to have my wish of pulling you up by your ear 

1097
01:49:30,708 --> 01:49:34,666
Pulling you up by the ear was a pleasure 

1098
01:49:36,791 --> 01:49:40,083
This first acquaintance, I shall always remember, mother-in-law 

1099
01:49:40,625 --> 01:49:42,500
Remember the relationship too 

1100
01:50:09,333 --> 01:50:15,583
Mr Landlord! Hurry up! Look, Paro is here 

1101
01:50:15,666 --> 01:50:17,708
Paro! How have you been? 

1102
01:50:17,791 --> 01:50:20,083
I've been expecting you for days. - Why the crowd next-door? 

1103
01:50:20,166 --> 01:50:22,625
Is everything all right? - Narayan Mukherjee... 

1104
01:50:22,708 --> 01:50:26,958
Breathing his last - Shouldn't we be there? 

1105
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,708
My heart won't let me 

1106
01:50:29,416 --> 01:50:36,625
Will you see the man who told you and your mother to run a brothel? 

1107
01:50:37,166 --> 01:50:42,500
Let not mistaken vanity destroy relationships 

1108
01:50:44,208 --> 01:50:46,000
I'm going over 

1109
01:50:48,708 --> 01:50:51,083
The entire village, all relatives came to pay their respects 

1110
01:50:51,708 --> 01:50:58,125
But no news of his dear son Devdas? How sad 

1111
01:50:58,958 --> 01:51:01,958
And here comes someone who has nothing to do 

1112
01:51:02,791 --> 01:51:05,833
Look Babu-ji, who's here to see you 

1113
01:51:06,791 --> 01:51:08,500
Devdas...? 

1114
01:51:08,583 --> 01:51:11,000
Master, your Paro is here 

1115
01:51:15,708 --> 01:51:18,708
No, no Babu-ji 

1116
01:51:20,333 --> 01:51:26,458
When you were children, I'd ask you to find Dev whenever he was lost 

1117
01:51:27,916 --> 01:51:32,708
I've forfeited myself the right, haven't I, Sumitra? 

1118
01:51:33,625 --> 01:51:36,458
All night, he was asking, where's Dev-where's Dev? 

1119
01:51:37,708 --> 01:51:41,583
Now where do I look for him, my tempest...? 

1120
01:51:42,458 --> 01:51:44,083
Dev! 

1121
01:51:47,625 --> 01:51:49,541
What happened? 

1122
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,166
Mr. Dev? 

1123
01:51:53,750 --> 01:51:55,291
Mr. Dev? 

1124
01:51:56,708 --> 01:51:59,750
If I am so despicable, if my touch be so abhorrent, then why... 

1125
01:51:59,833 --> 01:52:02,083
Did you come into my life? 

1126
01:52:02,166 --> 01:52:06,625
In my solitude I was content Why be my messiah of misery? 

1127
01:52:06,708 --> 01:52:07,916
Chandramukhi. 

1128
01:52:11,375 --> 01:52:15,166
That stopped the spasm didn't it? Divert your attentions and... 

1129
01:52:15,250 --> 01:52:19,583
the deepest wounds may be healed. - Which is what I am upto 

1130
01:52:20,125 --> 01:52:23,000
Stop it, you've had enough 

1131
01:52:25,708 --> 01:52:31,916
Why not say I've lived enough? - How could I...? 

1132
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:40,375
You have Paro, memories of Paro All I have is you, my Midas 

1133
01:52:41,083 --> 01:52:44,500
A touch and iron is made to gold 

1134
01:52:45,041 --> 01:52:51,250
Are you pricing yourself or me? - In a world of relationships... 

1135
01:52:51,333 --> 01:52:54,833
what value a woman of easy virtue? Nothing 

1136
01:52:55,416 --> 01:52:59,291
Besides, you won't even give me the right to touch you 

1137
01:53:02,958 --> 01:53:10,416
Are you in love with me? - Or you could ask me if I breathe 

1138
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,166
You breathe, Chandramukhi? 

1139
01:53:19,583 --> 01:53:23,708
What will you get out of it? I have no home, no heart 

1140
01:53:25,041 --> 01:53:32,000
Loving isn't only about receiving. Love, I have traded many times 

1141
01:53:32,250 --> 01:53:35,333
But loved, I have but once 

1142
01:53:37,416 --> 01:53:39,083
Chandramukhi... 

1143
01:53:40,458 --> 01:53:43,541
Pour more into a chalice filled, and what happens? 

1144
01:53:46,291 --> 01:53:48,958
It spills, to the ground 

1145
01:53:51,791 --> 01:53:55,416
So too my cup floweth over, with Paro 

1146
01:53:57,708 --> 01:54:01,833
More can only spill... 

1147
01:54:03,375 --> 01:54:07,333
to fall, and in the falling, take you down too 

1148
01:54:09,208 --> 01:54:16,958
But in the spilling, the wine must've been caressed by the chalice 

1149
01:54:27,541 --> 01:54:29,291
Then spill... 

1150
01:54:30,708 --> 01:54:32,708
some more 

1151
01:54:44,416 --> 01:54:48,000
Where is Devdas? I must see him 

1152
01:54:48,583 --> 01:54:54,083
Asleep. You can't see him now. - Can I not? I'm here to take him 

1153
01:54:54,166 --> 01:54:56,958
I'm not leaving him in this hell 

1154
01:54:59,291 --> 01:55:02,041
Master...! - Who gave you my whereabouts? 

1155
01:55:02,125 --> 01:55:03,708
Chuni Babu 

1156
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Babu-ji... 

1157
01:55:05,083 --> 01:55:09,083
Babu-ji won't even see my face Why has he sent you? 

1158
01:55:09,750 --> 01:55:14,583
Anyway, he will be displeased to see me as I am 

1159
01:55:15,416 --> 01:55:20,750
Sir Narayan Mukherjee will have to hang his head in shame 

1160
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:25,333
Sir! 

1161
01:55:25,583 --> 01:55:30,333
Go Dharamdas, go away. - Listen Deva... 

1162
01:55:33,458 --> 01:55:35,708
Your father is no more 

1163
01:56:11,750 --> 01:56:13,666
Madam... 

1164
01:56:14,083 --> 01:56:17,000
Madam... 

1165
01:56:39,416 --> 01:56:41,125
Too bad 

1166
01:56:44,208 --> 01:56:49,041
All of a sudden... how...? 

1167
01:56:51,291 --> 01:56:52,833
He was a nice man 

1168
01:56:54,666 --> 01:56:56,708
Such men aren't born too often 

1169
01:56:58,291 --> 01:56:59,916
He... he was a good man. 

1170
01:57:07,708 --> 01:57:09,708
Babu-ji has earned... 

1171
01:57:13,583 --> 01:57:15,708
another title, no? 

1172
01:57:17,083 --> 01:57:20,500
Late Sir Narayan Mukherjee 

1173
01:57:22,166 --> 01:57:24,083
We loved each other dearly 

1174
01:57:25,875 --> 01:57:29,666
But too bad, this is too bad 

1175
01:57:30,833 --> 01:57:32,541
Very... 

1176
01:57:35,208 --> 01:57:38,708
Late, Sir Mukherjee... 

1177
01:57:41,833 --> 01:57:43,916
was a good man 

1178
01:57:46,333 --> 01:57:52,208
Does Devdas drink every day? - When doesn't he drink? 

1179
01:57:52,291 --> 01:57:55,500
Alcohol, day and night. Lives on it 

1180
01:57:55,583 --> 01:57:59,541
Why don't you stop him? - But only if he'd stay at home 

1181
01:57:59,625 --> 01:58:02,625
Rarely does he come home. There he lies in Chitpore... 

1182
01:58:02,708 --> 01:58:05,291
in Chandramukhi's brothel, all day 

1183
01:58:05,541 --> 01:58:08,833
The room upstairs is practically Deva's residence 

1184
01:58:09,708 --> 01:58:12,541
Devdas! He lives in a brothel? 

1185
01:58:14,708 --> 01:58:17,333
Such days I have lived to see 

1186
01:58:17,750 --> 01:58:21,625
Have you seen Chandramukhi? - When I went to fetch Deva... 

1187
01:58:21,708 --> 01:58:25,083
I saw her. - What is she like? 

1188
01:58:25,708 --> 01:58:31,083
Sweet deceit, as they say. Famous courtesan, uses her charms 

1189
01:58:31,166 --> 01:58:38,666
She plunders, he squanders. We must rescue our Deva from the hell, Paro 

1190
01:58:38,958 --> 01:58:43,291
I cannot tell him anything, but he'll surely listen to you 

1191
01:58:43,541 --> 01:58:46,625
He holds you in high esteem, he can't refuse you 

1192
01:58:46,708 --> 01:58:48,291
Please Didi, tell her 

1193
01:58:48,375 --> 01:58:53,458
Only you can stop him, Paro. Only you can stop him from drinking 

1194
01:58:53,541 --> 01:58:58,250
Dharamdas, get a hold on yourself. - You'll see him won't you? 

1195
01:59:03,500 --> 01:59:07,666
Paro, do you want me to malign you, to give you a bad name? 

1196
01:59:08,750 --> 01:59:12,541
Had we given ourselves a bad name, we might've ended up together 

1197
01:59:17,291 --> 01:59:21,000
You're happy, aren't you Paro? - Oh it's a different world, Dev 

1198
01:59:21,833 --> 01:59:27,000
Huge manor, vast estates, important people, great debates 

1199
01:59:27,083 --> 01:59:32,500
Great debates! You've matured Paro 

1200
01:59:33,791 --> 01:59:39,000
You even look like an aristocrat. Huge red dot, large eyes... 

1201
01:59:39,625 --> 01:59:41,916
big dreams... 

1202
01:59:42,416 --> 01:59:44,833
huge manors, vast estates... 

1203
01:59:44,916 --> 01:59:49,000
and grown-up children 

1204
01:59:51,500 --> 01:59:53,791
Paro! Paro... Paro... hey! 

1205
01:59:57,625 --> 02:00:00,083
Those large eyes, I can keep watching 

1206
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,500
But I can't bear to see big teardrops in those eyes 

1207
02:00:07,833 --> 02:00:11,958
Just as well that you came by. I got some things I wish to return 

1208
02:00:12,625 --> 02:00:16,416
Who knows, I might never return 

1209
02:00:17,958 --> 02:00:19,958
Come... 

1210
02:00:21,541 --> 02:00:23,541
come with me 

1211
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,833
Stand right here 

1212
02:00:28,208 --> 02:00:29,416
Alright. 

1213
02:00:34,583 --> 02:00:35,708
Look... 

1214
02:00:36,333 --> 02:00:39,083
at yourself. Remember...? 

1215
02:00:41,708 --> 02:00:45,125
Arre O'Deva 

1216
02:00:47,833 --> 02:00:49,833
What happened Paro? 

1217
02:00:50,458 --> 02:00:53,000
Deva, I lost my anklets. Have you seen them? 

1218
02:00:53,541 --> 02:00:55,708
No Paro, not I 

1219
02:00:57,875 --> 02:00:59,333
I stole them 

1220
02:00:59,916 --> 02:01:03,166
And you knew I did it and why I did it 

1221
02:01:03,833 --> 02:01:08,500
All day, the chime of your anklets, and-Deva-this-and-Deva-that... 

1222
02:01:08,583 --> 02:01:10,791
And your pot 

1223
02:01:11,375 --> 02:01:14,666
And here, the memento of our love, our parting 

1224
02:01:15,250 --> 02:01:17,958
You just left, that was the end of the relationship 

1225
02:01:18,625 --> 02:01:21,083
But I'm still tied to all these, Paro 

1226
02:01:21,291 --> 02:01:23,708
And I am tied to memories of you 

1227
02:01:24,041 --> 02:01:26,625
What's that? - A few coins 

1228
02:01:26,708 --> 02:01:29,916
Three Rupees. - All they're worth are memories 

1229
02:01:30,708 --> 02:01:33,000
Mine, aren't they? You thief 

1230
02:01:33,791 --> 02:01:34,500
You thief 

1231
02:01:35,791 --> 02:01:39,708
I'll take them back, but only with usury 

1232
02:01:40,541 --> 02:01:44,208
How much interest will you take? - Two percent 

1233
02:01:47,041 --> 02:01:48,833
At two percent... 

1234
02:01:49,458 --> 02:01:50,708
six cents a month... 

1235
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:53,541
72 cents a year... 

1236
02:01:54,541 --> 02:01:56,208
For 13 years... 

1237
02:01:57,250 --> 02:01:59,083
13 years, Paro 

1238
02:01:59,791 --> 02:02:01,291
9.36 

1239
02:02:03,291 --> 02:02:08,208
You've become good at arithmetic. - Circumstance taught me, Paro 

1240
02:02:09,208 --> 02:02:11,000
Let's talk of something else 

1241
02:02:13,166 --> 02:02:18,541
Paro, why not turn matchmaker and find a bride for Devdas? 

1242
02:02:19,083 --> 02:02:26,625
I hear Manikpur girls are nice? - Yes, but you want a beauty, no? 

1243
02:02:26,708 --> 02:02:30,291
No, not a beauty. Just someone like you 

1244
02:02:32,791 --> 02:02:36,000
Someone who is pleasant? - No, must be a bit naughty 

1245
02:02:36,083 --> 02:02:40,791
Should be able to quarrel with me. Like I said, she should be like you 

1246
02:02:41,208 --> 02:02:44,166
You can find them by the thousands. - Spare me the thousands 

1247
02:02:44,250 --> 02:02:46,666
Just let me come to grips with only one, of the likes you. Enough 

1248
02:02:51,083 --> 02:02:54,916
Give up drinking. - No 

1249
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,416
Try. - No 

1250
02:02:56,708 --> 02:03:00,208
You can give it up. Promise me that you'll never drink again 

1251
02:03:00,625 --> 02:03:02,708
Can you promise you'll forget me? 

1252
02:03:07,208 --> 02:03:08,875
It's rather late, Paro 

1253
02:03:11,125 --> 02:03:12,083
Dev! 

1254
02:03:12,375 --> 02:03:14,250
I'm not leaving until I have your word 

1255
02:03:14,333 --> 02:03:16,000
I can't. - You can 

1256
02:03:16,083 --> 02:03:20,750
One can do anything one wants. - Can you elope with me tonight? 

1257
02:03:20,833 --> 02:03:23,041
What are you saying? - Can you elope with me? 

1258
02:03:23,125 --> 02:03:26,208
You've no one to look after you. - Can you elope with me? 

1259
02:03:26,291 --> 02:03:30,625
I had only one dream. To serve you. - If there's love, there's no fear 

1260
02:03:30,708 --> 02:03:34,833
One chance to fulfill my dream? - Can you elope with me? Can you? 

1261
02:03:34,916 --> 02:03:37,625
Come with me. I'll care for you. - Can you elope with me, Paro? 

1262
02:03:37,708 --> 02:03:40,541
I can't bear to see you like this! I feel like dying, Dev 

1263
02:03:41,958 --> 02:03:43,875
I feel like dying 

1264
02:03:45,916 --> 02:03:52,375
If serving me makes you happy, then so be it 

1265
02:03:55,166 --> 02:04:00,708
I promise you, before I die I'll surely come to your doorstep 

1266
02:04:04,583 --> 02:04:07,541
Swear that, by me 

1267
02:04:31,458 --> 02:04:33,000
Heartless 

1268
02:04:40,750 --> 02:04:44,708
Your mother is squandering money. Given so charitable a disposition... 

1269
02:04:44,791 --> 02:04:49,291
soon the coffers will be empty. - Absolutely right, Kumud 

1270
02:04:49,833 --> 02:04:56,583
But how can I stop Ma? - You're such a complete fool 

1271
02:04:57,250 --> 02:05:03,500
You can't. But I can stop her. - You will stop her? But how? 

1272
02:05:05,791 --> 02:05:07,000
The keys to the vault? With you? 

1273
02:05:07,083 --> 02:05:09,666
Ma has been looking for them. Give it to... 

1274
02:05:12,291 --> 02:05:13,583
Kumud! 

1275
02:05:14,416 --> 02:05:19,166
I've hidden the keys. You will say that the keys are lost 

1276
02:05:19,250 --> 02:05:22,500
What...? - The vault keys are lost 

1277
02:05:23,708 --> 02:05:28,083
And the vault has been robbed 

1278
02:05:32,708 --> 02:05:34,625
The key... 

1279
02:05:34,708 --> 02:05:36,541
to the money 

1280
02:05:38,791 --> 02:05:41,958
Brother-in-law! You...? So early? In the offices? 

1281
02:05:42,541 --> 02:05:46,750
And alcohol...? Without as much as a care for the family prestige? 

1282
02:05:47,083 --> 02:05:49,333
What will people say? What will your mother think? 

1283
02:05:50,916 --> 02:05:53,083
You didn't consider that when you were stealing the keys? 

1284
02:05:53,875 --> 02:05:58,833
What will people say? What will your Chhoto-Ma think? 

1285
02:05:58,916 --> 02:06:02,583
The wealth of our forefathers may not be squandered over alcohol 

1286
02:06:03,583 --> 02:06:07,791
The keys left by our forefathers may not be stolen like this 

1287
02:06:07,875 --> 02:06:11,625
I'm making this clear. Under no circumstance... 

1288
02:06:11,708 --> 02:06:16,208
am I parting with the keys. - You will turn in the keys 

1289
02:06:17,708 --> 02:06:20,166
Today and now 

1290
02:06:22,416 --> 02:06:24,208
Right here 

1291
02:06:26,041 --> 02:06:27,541
To my mother 

1292
02:06:28,208 --> 02:06:32,916
Do not think I am so weak. I too hail from a family of landlords 

1293
02:06:33,083 --> 02:06:35,583
I have seen money by the chestfuls in my father's house 

1294
02:06:37,250 --> 02:06:39,958
Have you seen the streak of madness that runs in the family? 

1295
02:06:49,125 --> 02:06:51,875
What are you upto, Dev? - Brother you surely agree that... 

1296
02:06:51,958 --> 02:06:59,208
I have as much right as you to the wealth that our forefathers left us 

1297
02:06:59,291 --> 02:07:02,625
Yes. Why are you pouring alcohol? 

1298
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:13,208
I'm putting on fire my share. Save your share if you can 

1299
02:07:13,916 --> 02:07:19,750
I'll give you anything you want! - As of now... 

1300
02:07:20,708 --> 02:07:23,583
only the keys. - Which you will never have 

1301
02:07:30,041 --> 02:07:33,166
Kumud! Give him the keys. Else, he'll burn down the office 

1302
02:07:33,250 --> 02:07:36,791
Let him do whatever he wants. I'm not scared of empty threats 

1303
02:07:42,708 --> 02:07:46,833
He's actually burning the place down! Call Chhoto-Ma 

1304
02:07:46,916 --> 02:07:49,000
Give him the keys, Kumud. - No 

1305
02:07:49,083 --> 02:07:51,083
He's crazy! Are you out of your mind too? 

1306
02:07:51,166 --> 02:07:53,000
No! - Give him the keys 

1307
02:07:53,083 --> 02:07:55,083
What's up Kumud? 

1308
02:07:56,250 --> 02:07:58,416
What's happening in this house? 

1309
02:07:59,458 --> 02:08:00,625
Aunt! 

1310
02:08:04,583 --> 02:08:09,375
You were looking for the keys to the vault, weren't you? 

1311
02:08:09,791 --> 02:08:14,250
I caught him with the keys and he threatened me 

1312
02:08:14,333 --> 02:08:18,541
He won't part with the keys and he wants his share 

1313
02:08:18,625 --> 02:08:26,000
Else, he'll burn the house down. I pleaded with him... 

1314
02:08:28,291 --> 02:08:29,916
You want your share? 

1315
02:08:35,083 --> 02:08:37,500
That is your only share 

1316
02:08:39,541 --> 02:08:41,291
No one in this house ever understood you 

1317
02:08:42,083 --> 02:08:44,208
All of us are responsible for your ruination 

1318
02:08:45,208 --> 02:08:50,583
Before we lead you to worse, leave this house 

1319
02:08:50,916 --> 02:08:54,625
Babu-ji said leave the village. Everyone said, leave Paro 

1320
02:08:54,708 --> 02:08:59,250
Paro said, leave drinking. Now you say, leave this house 

1321
02:08:59,708 --> 02:09:02,708
One day, He will say... 

1322
02:09:03,416 --> 02:09:05,208
leave this world 

1323
02:09:07,541 --> 02:09:10,416
Hereby I rescind all my rights to everything in this house 

1324
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:19,625
But I am part of you. That right no one takes away from me 

1325
02:09:20,416 --> 02:09:22,250
Not even you 

1326
02:10:11,416 --> 02:10:13,625
Do you know what you are asking for, daughter-in-law? 

1327
02:10:14,166 --> 02:10:15,791
Grand veneration of Goddess Durga! 

1328
02:10:16,125 --> 02:10:20,875
It's no easy undertaking, it's an ancient ritual 

1329
02:10:21,416 --> 02:10:27,875
For the ritual, one must fetch the soil from a courtesan's doorstep 

1330
02:10:28,041 --> 02:10:31,958
In that soil, is built the image of the goddess 

1331
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,166
I know 

1332
02:10:33,250 --> 02:10:37,958
And go where men daren't even walk in daytimes for fear of censure? 

1333
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:43,666
Don't humans live there? Is there no air...? 

1334
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:49,500
No sun in those quarters? Do rains refuse to visit them? 

1335
02:10:50,041 --> 02:10:52,958
Nature doesn't discriminate. Should we? 

1336
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:58,500
Parvati is right. Even Subhadra wanted it done 

1337
02:10:58,583 --> 02:11:01,500
Very well, as our Parvati wishes 

1338
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:06,375
But remember, it's the Durga Puja. - Rest assured 

1339
02:11:07,583 --> 02:11:11,625
I'll tell Mahendra to facilitate your journey 

1340
02:11:13,333 --> 02:11:16,416
"Devdas lives in a brothel?" 

1341
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:18,375
Oh, God! 

1342
02:11:18,833 --> 02:11:24,000
A lady is here, wants to see you. She's also asking about Dev Babu 

1343
02:11:25,041 --> 02:11:26,916
Must be Paro 

1344
02:11:34,125 --> 02:11:35,625
Paro...? 

1345
02:11:35,708 --> 02:11:41,458
How did you know I'm Parvati? - Dev Babu told me... 

1346
02:11:41,541 --> 02:11:47,583
should a woman come asking for him, she can only be Paro 

1347
02:11:47,666 --> 02:11:49,291
What are you doing? 

1348
02:11:50,750 --> 02:11:55,875
My obeisances to the woman, whom I shall never be able to replace 

1349
02:11:55,958 --> 02:12:04,000
I have heard of exotic women here, but you possess the wile too 

1350
02:12:04,083 --> 02:12:07,791
Only if you'd see, I have a heart too 

1351
02:12:08,041 --> 02:12:11,625
Chandramukhi... isn't that your name? 

1352
02:12:13,875 --> 02:12:16,708
They also call me Devdasi 

1353
02:12:19,291 --> 02:12:23,875
You are famous. - Not anymore 

1354
02:12:24,625 --> 02:12:25,875
Why? 

1355
02:12:26,333 --> 02:12:32,291
At angel's touch, I learnt of a sacrifice I never knew 

1356
02:12:33,916 --> 02:12:38,333
How strange of a courtesan to swear by fidelity 

1357
02:12:39,208 --> 02:12:41,916
Curious too... 

1358
02:12:42,708 --> 02:12:46,083
what draws an aristocrat to a courtesan's doorstep? 

1359
02:12:47,916 --> 02:12:49,083
Where is Dev? 

1360
02:12:50,625 --> 02:12:55,458
I too am eager to hear his footfall. Six months it has been... 

1361
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:00,291
since I set my eyes on him. - You lie 

1362
02:13:01,916 --> 02:13:06,708
If you don't trust, look around. - Or do you assume I won't? 

1363
02:13:07,500 --> 02:13:09,708
How long do you think you can keep Dev here? 

1364
02:13:10,375 --> 02:13:14,541
Only so long as the beauty, the youth, the money? 

1365
02:13:15,291 --> 02:13:20,625
What's your endgame? You must have fleeced Dev 

1366
02:13:20,833 --> 02:13:26,375
I'll pay you more. I can't bear to see Dev suffering this hell 

1367
02:13:30,291 --> 02:13:32,083
How strange 

1368
02:13:33,541 --> 02:13:40,125
The very Paro who drove Dev Babu to insanity, wants to buy him 

1369
02:13:43,083 --> 02:13:47,291
And what may you have to offer me? Can you offer social recognition? 

1370
02:13:47,916 --> 02:13:50,708
Can you possibly make him love me? 

1371
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,166
Or make it possible that I may touch him, just once? 

1372
02:13:54,125 --> 02:13:59,666
Dreams, longing, hopes, that he has kindled in my heart... 

1373
02:14:00,375 --> 02:14:03,708
might you make them come true? Can you? 

1374
02:14:05,083 --> 02:14:08,250
No, you cannot deliver 

1375
02:14:10,666 --> 02:14:15,291
And I will not give you Dev Babu. - And I will take him away 

1376
02:14:15,916 --> 02:14:22,875
And no one is stopping me. Not you, not social sanction, not even Dev 

1377
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:28,833
Not to forget, courtesans aren't destined to have husbands 

1378
02:14:32,291 --> 02:14:34,833
Courtesans have no destiny, lady 

1379
02:14:51,833 --> 02:14:57,833
From your perspective, you can see nothing. From mine... 

1380
02:14:58,958 --> 02:15:01,375
you will find him everywhere 

1381
02:15:03,291 --> 02:15:07,333
Look, there he is, in the flame of the lamp 

1382
02:15:08,333 --> 02:15:10,416
There he lies, in folds of the covers 

1383
02:15:10,875 --> 02:15:12,416
In that half a chalice... 

1384
02:15:12,791 --> 02:15:18,541
his thirst lies, unquenched. His fragrance still lingers 

1385
02:15:19,041 --> 02:15:25,875
Take it all, if you can. The light, the folds, the fragrance, all of it 

1386
02:15:36,500 --> 02:15:38,000
All yours 

1387
02:15:39,208 --> 02:15:43,666
But I cannot give you your Devdas. - You love Dev so dearly? 

1388
02:15:45,458 --> 02:15:47,708
I only worship him 

1389
02:15:48,833 --> 02:15:52,416
Now I'm assured. Dev isn't lonely anymore 

1390
02:15:54,791 --> 02:16:00,958
Oh I forgot what I came here for. I want to perform the Durga Puja 

1391
02:16:01,416 --> 02:16:03,375
From your doorstep, I want soil 

1392
02:16:03,875 --> 02:16:05,416
May I...? 

1393
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:23,083
What is this? - I came for Dev. Instead... 

1394
02:16:23,166 --> 02:16:25,166
it's something I entrust you with 

1395
02:16:27,500 --> 02:16:31,750
I will expect you for the Durga Puja. Do come 

1396
02:16:37,375 --> 02:16:39,125
Hail to Goddess Durga! 

1397
02:16:58,541 --> 02:16:59,916
Chandramukhi... 

1398
02:17:03,166 --> 02:17:05,166
I'm so happy to have you here 

1399
02:17:05,250 --> 02:17:07,458
I'm glad 

1400
02:17:07,541 --> 02:17:11,750
How could I refuse your invitation? I had to come 

1401
02:17:11,833 --> 02:17:13,750
Have you met Dev? 

1402
02:17:15,416 --> 02:17:16,541
Parvati? 

1403
02:17:18,083 --> 02:17:19,708
Who is this? 

1404
02:17:19,958 --> 02:17:25,041
Chandramukhi, my friend. She comes from Calcutta 

1405
02:17:25,458 --> 02:17:31,500
Bless you, consider this your home. Parvati, don't let her go too soon 

1406
02:17:31,583 --> 02:17:35,625
Sure. You will leave only after the celebrations 

1407
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,833
No Paro! I can't stay here 

1408
02:17:38,916 --> 02:17:43,541
Why not? It's been ages since I had a heart-to-heart chat with someone 

1409
02:17:43,625 --> 02:17:47,541
Come, let celebrations be the ruse for forgetting our woes 

1410
02:17:47,625 --> 02:17:51,000
Let's sing, dance, give ourselves a little to live 

1411
02:17:51,041 --> 02:17:54,750
No... - Our joys might touch Dev 

1412
02:17:55,083 --> 02:17:58,916
Paro, listen to me. - No refusing. For Dev's sake 

1413
02:18:00,250 --> 02:18:03,416
Come Kali Babu, the chess game isn't over yet 

1414
02:18:04,083 --> 02:18:06,583
The real chessgame is being played here 

1415
02:18:07,166 --> 02:18:11,083
Devdas' Chandramukhi comes. To meet Devdas' Paro 

1416
02:18:11,291 --> 02:18:13,291
Who's Paro? - Mother-in-law 

1417
02:18:14,583 --> 02:18:18,291
Parvati. One move and I've checkmated all four 

1418
02:18:19,708 --> 02:18:20,708
Paro 

1419
02:18:21,083 --> 02:18:22,375
Chandramukhi 

1420
02:18:22,833 --> 02:18:24,083
Bhuvan Chaudhary 

1421
02:18:25,583 --> 02:18:27,083
Devdas 

1422
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:31,458
Deva, the day is dawning 

1423
02:18:31,541 --> 02:18:36,541
But forever, this heart will live in darkness 

1424
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
Shall we go now? - To whom? 

1425
02:18:41,125 --> 02:18:44,000
One by one, all my relationships are over 

1426
02:18:45,291 --> 02:18:49,375
Between my father and I there was no love lost, right? 

1427
02:18:49,875 --> 02:18:50,666
Right. 

1428
02:18:51,791 --> 02:18:56,000
I was his tempest and he was my whip 

1429
02:19:07,375 --> 02:19:11,000
Even my brother figured first in mother's lullaby, right? 

1430
02:19:11,083 --> 02:19:12,083
Right. Elder brother and I never hit it off. 

1431
02:19:12,416 --> 02:19:20,250
My brother and I never hit it off. He's practical, I'm impractical 

1432
02:19:20,875 --> 02:19:21,791
Right. 

1433
02:19:22,500 --> 02:19:25,708
One inculcates a humorous relationship with a brother's wife 

1434
02:19:26,958 --> 02:19:30,458
I was the one who ended up being the butt of the joke, right? 

1435
02:19:33,375 --> 02:19:38,291
And there was Paro and I love her... 

1436
02:19:39,125 --> 02:19:40,291
you know... 

1437
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:42,208
so much 

1438
02:19:46,916 --> 02:19:48,875
So much, right? 

1439
02:19:52,125 --> 02:19:53,875
Paro! 

1440
02:19:59,750 --> 02:20:01,708
Now she is estranged too 

1441
02:20:02,416 --> 02:20:04,083
Estranged! 

1442
02:20:08,375 --> 02:20:10,083
But there's one... 

1443
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:16,625
one Chandramukhi. Loves me dearly 

1444
02:20:16,708 --> 02:20:18,166
But... 

1445
02:20:19,875 --> 02:20:21,541
But... 

1446
02:20:22,541 --> 02:20:23,708
Priest? 

1447
02:20:26,333 --> 02:20:27,833
Priest... 

1448
02:20:31,791 --> 02:20:33,583
Priest... - Careful... careful. 

1449
02:20:35,041 --> 02:20:36,916
Greetings, priest. - Greetings. 

1450
02:20:37,541 --> 02:20:39,916
Are you familiar with the last rites? - Of course 

1451
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:43,458
Will you perform the ritual? - Of course. Who is the deceased? 

1452
02:20:43,541 --> 02:20:46,000
Devdas Mukherjee - Are you insane? 

1453
02:20:46,083 --> 02:20:46,916
Priest, Devdas Mukherjee. 

1454
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,541
You'll perform your last rites? - Give me my last rites 

1455
02:20:49,625 --> 02:20:51,083
Priest, go away 

1456
02:20:51,541 --> 02:20:52,750
Priest! 

1457
02:20:59,666 --> 02:21:01,458
Hey Deva! 

1458
02:21:02,250 --> 02:21:04,083
Hey Deva! Hey Deva! 

1459
02:21:04,333 --> 02:21:07,625
Deva! What madness is this? 

1460
02:21:07,708 --> 02:21:09,708
Come back 

1461
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:13,291
"Unto the departed Soul..." 

1462
02:21:14,083 --> 02:21:16,875
"grant salvation, Lord" 

1463
02:21:17,458 --> 02:21:21,125
Come back, I beg of you 

1464
02:21:30,958 --> 02:21:34,583
"of the throb..." 

1465
02:21:34,666 --> 02:21:37,958
"of the throb..." 

1466
02:21:38,875 --> 02:21:42,916
"of the throb..." 

1467
02:23:00,208 --> 02:23:03,625
"The throb..." 

1468
02:23:03,708 --> 02:23:07,375
"sways my heart" 

1469
02:23:07,458 --> 02:23:10,791
"The throb..." 

1470
02:23:10,875 --> 02:23:15,000
"sways my heart" 

1471
02:23:15,041 --> 02:23:18,958
"I dare that evil eye or let thunder strike" 

1472
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:22,000
"Thunder, thunder" 

1473
02:23:22,375 --> 02:23:25,541
"I dare that evil eye or let thunder strike" 

1474
02:23:25,625 --> 02:23:29,333
"I'll wear my dancing bells" 

1475
02:23:29,416 --> 02:23:33,125
"In my anklets..." 

1476
02:23:33,208 --> 02:23:36,916
"I will give in to the ecstasy..." 

1477
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:40,458
"of the throb..." 

1478
02:23:40,541 --> 02:23:44,333
"that sways my heart, my soul" 

1479
02:23:44,416 --> 02:23:47,916
"of the throb..." 

1480
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:52,416
"sways my heart" 

1481
02:24:02,583 --> 02:24:06,625
"What chimes?" 

1482
02:24:06,708 --> 02:24:10,000
"What's that love in eyes?" 

1483
02:24:10,083 --> 02:24:13,708
"Why the crescendo?" 

1484
02:24:13,791 --> 02:24:18,166
"Is it longing?" 

1485
02:24:20,875 --> 02:24:24,125
"He's in the red dot I wear" 

1486
02:24:24,208 --> 02:24:27,833
"He's in the dream in my eyes" 

1487
02:24:27,916 --> 02:24:31,833
"You're obsessed" 

1488
02:24:31,916 --> 02:24:34,541
"Your heart beats for him" 

1489
02:24:35,166 --> 02:24:39,458
"I remember him in the chime" 

1490
02:24:42,583 --> 02:24:46,583
"I remember him in the tinkle" 

1491
02:24:49,916 --> 02:24:53,458
"I remember him in the chime" 

1492
02:24:53,541 --> 02:24:57,708
"I remember him in the tinkle" 

1493
02:24:57,791 --> 02:25:01,208
"In my anklets..." 

1494
02:25:01,291 --> 02:25:05,166
"I will give in to the ecstasy..." 

1495
02:25:05,250 --> 02:25:08,583
"of the throb..." 

1496
02:25:08,666 --> 02:25:12,333
"that sways my heart, my soul" 

1497
02:25:12,416 --> 02:25:15,916
"of the throb..." 

1498
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:19,875
"that sways my heart, my soul" 

1499
02:25:52,416 --> 02:25:58,791
"You've given me a world..." 

1500
02:25:59,625 --> 02:26:07,000
"of your own happinesses" 

1501
02:26:07,083 --> 02:26:12,333
"Never desert him" 

1502
02:26:14,291 --> 02:26:19,750
"Marry him" 

1503
02:26:21,666 --> 02:26:28,208
"To him you are priceless" 

1504
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:34,416
"I am worthless" 

1505
02:26:36,833 --> 02:26:40,125
"In my anklets..." 

1506
02:26:40,208 --> 02:26:44,000
"In my anklets..." 

1507
02:26:44,083 --> 02:26:47,791
"I will give in to the ecstasy..." 

1508
02:26:47,875 --> 02:26:51,291
"of the throb..." 

1509
02:26:51,375 --> 02:26:55,166
"that sways my heart, my soul" 

1510
02:26:55,250 --> 02:26:58,875
"of the throb..." 

1511
02:26:58,958 --> 02:27:02,916
"that sways my heart, my soul" 

1512
02:27:17,208 --> 02:27:19,000
"of the throb..." 

1513
02:27:19,083 --> 02:27:20,625
"of the throb..." 

1514
02:27:20,916 --> 02:27:22,791
"of the throb..." 

1515
02:27:22,875 --> 02:27:24,500
"of the throb..." 

1516
02:27:42,666 --> 02:27:46,041
"of the throb..." 

1517
02:27:51,791 --> 02:27:53,083
Wonderful 

1518
02:27:54,291 --> 02:27:56,166
What a display of true colour 

1519
02:27:57,416 --> 02:28:02,875
An aristocrat and a courtesan come together 

1520
02:28:03,291 --> 02:28:04,333
Great! 

1521
02:28:04,416 --> 02:28:07,625
What are you saying? - That which you see, Badi-Ma 

1522
02:28:07,708 --> 02:28:09,250
And what everyone is watching 

1523
02:28:10,083 --> 02:28:14,041
This woman, whom Mother-in-law calls a friend, is a whore 

1524
02:28:14,708 --> 02:28:16,250
Yes Mother-in-law? 

1525
02:28:18,500 --> 02:28:20,250
What am I hearing Parvati? 

1526
02:28:21,333 --> 02:28:25,083
Why are you silent? Answer. - She is embarrassed 

1527
02:28:25,708 --> 02:28:30,416
Landlords did keep whores 

1528
02:28:30,583 --> 02:28:35,041
Now even a lady of the manor makes friendships in brothels. Wonderment 

1529
02:28:35,916 --> 02:28:42,958
That's stripping without touching. You started the farce. I ended it 

1530
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:48,041
No Kali Babu, if men could enact farce, what need for whores? 

1531
02:28:48,666 --> 02:28:50,666
You would've had your brothel too 

1532
02:28:50,750 --> 02:28:51,458
Chandramukhi! 

1533
02:28:51,541 --> 02:28:54,041
You know it and it's commonplace 

1534
02:28:54,708 --> 02:28:57,833
It is the aristocrat who brings cheer to the brothels 

1535
02:28:58,333 --> 02:29:02,000
And bastards are born of aristocrats of your ilk 

1536
02:29:02,416 --> 02:29:06,791
Call them illegitimate if you will, but aristocracy runs in their veins 

1537
02:29:06,875 --> 02:29:09,875
Company of the aristocracy doesn't confer status to the courtesan 

1538
02:29:09,958 --> 02:29:15,291
Absolutely correct, Badi-Ma. But why should the lady be embarrassed? 

1539
02:29:15,708 --> 02:29:20,958
If she spoke a few kind words to me, it's because she considers me human 

1540
02:29:21,916 --> 02:29:27,291
He who frequents the alleyways of disrepute ought to be ashamed 

1541
02:29:27,916 --> 02:29:30,958
The very dens littered with trophies of the lust of his forefathers 

1542
02:29:32,375 --> 02:29:37,875
Have you thought? You might have a sister somewhere in the brothels 

1543
02:29:38,708 --> 02:29:41,208
Why sister? You might even visit your daughter's... 

1544
02:29:41,291 --> 02:29:42,541
Chandramukhi! 

1545
02:29:44,625 --> 02:29:47,000
In the soil at the courtesan's doorstep... 

1546
02:29:47,083 --> 02:29:51,541
is moulded the image of the goddess. The soil isn't impotent 

1547
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:55,708
Now the farce ends 

1548
02:30:02,708 --> 02:30:04,708
I return, lady... 

1549
02:30:05,458 --> 02:30:12,000
back to my world, to those disreputable alleys... 

1550
02:30:12,916 --> 02:30:15,041
where I might someday find Dev Babu again 

1551
02:30:19,208 --> 02:30:20,250
Farewell 

1552
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
Before leaving, I wish to apologise 

1553
02:30:41,291 --> 02:30:45,375
Talking in public about Chandramukhi was a mistake 

1554
02:30:46,458 --> 02:30:51,083
I didn't make the other mistake. I told your husband and Badi Ma... 

1555
02:30:51,750 --> 02:30:54,791
about your friendship with Devdas 

1556
02:30:56,541 --> 02:31:00,916
You liked twisting my ear? I would cut your nose to spite your face 

1557
02:31:02,125 --> 02:31:03,458
Goodbye 

1558
02:31:07,833 --> 02:31:09,958
Not at Parvati, fingers will be raised at us 

1559
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:14,750
The matter must end here and now 

1560
02:31:14,958 --> 02:31:18,291
Did you ask for me? - Yes Parvati 

1561
02:31:19,500 --> 02:31:22,291
I would like to know... - Who Devdas is? 

1562
02:31:23,083 --> 02:31:28,791
Devdas is a childhood friend, he was body, I was soul 

1563
02:31:29,500 --> 02:31:35,416
He is my love and he is my vanity and he is with me, always 

1564
02:31:35,750 --> 02:31:40,916
Do you realise what you are saying? - Same as what you told me 

1565
02:31:41,500 --> 02:31:46,041
You're now the lady of the manor, the mother of my children. No doubt 

1566
02:31:46,333 --> 02:31:49,833
But Subhadra, I can never forget. - Subhadra was my wife 

1567
02:31:49,916 --> 02:31:53,750
Subhadra was your first love. Devdas is mine 

1568
02:31:54,625 --> 02:31:59,166
First love, like years can never be obliterated 

1569
02:31:59,333 --> 02:32:03,208
Parvati, you are forgetting. You are the lady of the manor 

1570
02:32:03,291 --> 02:32:10,541
Maybe that's reason for my guilt? I'll accept any penalty you decree 

1571
02:32:10,625 --> 02:32:13,041
Of course you will be punished 

1572
02:32:13,916 --> 02:32:21,041
The very men who paid obeisances to this manor are enjoying a farce 

1573
02:32:22,416 --> 02:32:28,958
You may never step out of the manor. This is your punishment 

1574
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:33,333
But what punishment, Parvati? We are the ones being punished 

1575
02:32:34,500 --> 02:32:38,375
The lamps we lit in celebration have set fire to our house 

1576
02:32:39,500 --> 02:32:43,291
Always put out the fires that threaten your home 

1577
02:33:05,041 --> 02:33:10,000
Fun, frolic and friends 

1578
02:33:10,875 --> 02:33:17,500
Without you, life was desolate. With you, comes the cheer 

1579
02:33:18,291 --> 02:33:26,333
Why care for outcomes? Let's raise cheer 

1580
02:33:26,416 --> 02:33:28,041
Yes friend? 

1581
02:33:37,708 --> 02:33:41,833
"Let clink the glasses" 

1582
02:33:45,250 --> 02:33:51,250
"Let clink the glasses, whatever the outcome" 

1583
02:33:52,500 --> 02:33:54,000
"Look how" 

1584
02:34:12,583 --> 02:34:19,500
"Let clink the glasses, whatever the outcome" 

1585
02:34:19,583 --> 02:34:24,916
"And hear the "chhalak-chal" in the swirl" 

1586
02:34:25,291 --> 02:34:29,708
"And hear the "chhalak-chal" in the swirl" 

1587
02:34:29,791 --> 02:34:34,375
"Music, when my cup floweth over" 

1588
02:34:34,458 --> 02:34:36,083
"Look how" 

1589
02:34:39,291 --> 02:34:44,875
"And hear the "dhamk-dhamk-dham" inside your heart..." 

1590
02:34:44,958 --> 02:34:49,541
"And hear the "dhamk-dhamk-dham" inside your heart..." 

1591
02:34:49,625 --> 02:34:53,916
"when you clink the glasses" 

1592
02:35:21,916 --> 02:35:26,125
"This"madeira"..." 

1593
02:35:26,583 --> 02:35:31,458
"This"madeira"showers a rain of memories" 

1594
02:35:31,541 --> 02:35:36,416
"In every spill, "madeira" cheats the heart" 

1595
02:35:36,500 --> 02:35:42,916
"The"madeira "coursing down tells..." 

1596
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:46,250
"tales of hearts" 

1597
02:35:46,500 --> 02:35:51,458
"Like lightning in hearts, it strikes clouds of sorrow" 

1598
02:35:51,541 --> 02:35:56,416
"And when it reaches the heart..." 

1599
02:35:56,500 --> 02:36:00,750
"it evokes..." 

1600
02:36:01,416 --> 02:36:05,500
"memories of her" 

1601
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:11,000
"Oh for a glimpse..." 

1602
02:36:11,083 --> 02:36:15,916
"Oh for a glimpse of her" 

1603
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,250
"That's..." 

1604
02:36:18,333 --> 02:36:22,791
"what little I pray for" 

1605
02:36:23,291 --> 02:36:28,083
"So little I pray for" 

1606
02:36:28,166 --> 02:36:33,458
"So little I pray for" 

1607
02:36:43,083 --> 02:36:49,833
"Mira dances for her Ghanshyam..." 

1608
02:36:50,708 --> 02:36:57,125
"she dances in gay abandon" 

1609
02:37:02,500 --> 02:37:07,833
"Hear the "jhanak-jhank-jhan" in the chime of her anklets" 

1610
02:37:07,916 --> 02:37:12,208
"Hear the "jhanak-jhank-jhan" in the chime of her anklets" 

1611
02:37:12,958 --> 02:37:17,041
"I'm in love, I don't care for censure" 

1612
02:37:19,583 --> 02:37:23,250
"And how..." 

1613
02:37:23,958 --> 02:37:30,250
"Now hear the "thirak-thirak"? That's my heart dancing away" 

1614
02:37:30,333 --> 02:37:35,083
"Now hear the "thirak-thirak"? That's my heart dancing away" 

1615
02:37:35,166 --> 02:37:40,083
"And hear the "dhamk-dhamk-dham" inside your heart..." 

1616
02:37:40,166 --> 02:37:45,000
"And hear the "dhamk-dhamk-dham" inside your heart..." 

1617
02:38:09,458 --> 02:38:13,916
"Hear the beats of your hearts and the swirl" 

1618
02:38:14,375 --> 02:38:19,291
"Continue beating and swirling" 

1619
02:38:19,541 --> 02:38:24,125
"And hear the "chhalak-chal" in the swirl" 

1620
02:38:24,208 --> 02:38:29,416
"And hear the "chhalak-chal" in the swirl" 

1621
02:38:29,500 --> 02:38:33,625
"And hear the "chhalak-chal" in the swirl" 

1622
02:38:33,708 --> 02:38:38,666
"And hear the "chhalak-chal" in the swirl" 

1623
02:38:38,958 --> 02:38:43,833
"Let clink the glasses" 

1624
02:38:43,916 --> 02:38:48,791
"Let clink the glasses" 

1625
02:38:48,875 --> 02:38:52,416
"Let clink the glasses" 

1626
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:02,750
Even a drop of alcohol is poison for him 

1627
02:39:04,458 --> 02:39:06,500
Any moment may be treacherous 

1628
02:39:07,916 --> 02:39:10,291
Try to keep him in good cheer 

1629
02:39:13,625 --> 02:39:15,000
Oh God! 

1630
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:23,125
What is this Dharamdas? Cry and you will make me cry too 

1631
02:39:23,750 --> 02:39:27,791
And people will call me a courtesan who cannot enact a farce 

1632
02:39:28,666 --> 02:39:32,750
We got to keep Dev Babu in good cheer, no? 

1633
02:39:33,583 --> 02:39:36,625
You're absolutely right. Let's wipe our tears 

1634
02:39:36,916 --> 02:39:42,000
Let our laughter ring in Dev's ears 

1635
02:39:42,875 --> 02:39:47,875
Yes Dharamdas. - Let's fill his life with joys 

1636
02:39:49,625 --> 02:39:54,500
Yes Dharamdas. - All his woes be gone 

1637
02:39:56,708 --> 02:40:00,958
Yes Dharamdas, yes 

1638
02:40:02,833 --> 02:40:06,208
Game over. I win again 

1639
02:40:06,291 --> 02:40:07,791
Show. 

1640
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:13,333
No point playing with you! You've robbed us blind 

1641
02:40:13,666 --> 02:40:17,125
A few more games with you and you'll make me sell this brothel 

1642
02:40:18,166 --> 02:40:20,916
Stop giggling and get lost 

1643
02:40:21,500 --> 02:40:23,833
Time for your medicine. I'll send it over 

1644
02:40:23,916 --> 02:40:29,875
In a chalice. Else, it won't work. - Even contemplating it is lethal 

1645
02:40:31,500 --> 02:40:33,500
Met Paro? 

1646
02:40:36,708 --> 02:40:41,000
How did you find my Paro? - If love be personified... 

1647
02:40:41,208 --> 02:40:44,833
Paro's would be the being, hers the very heart 

1648
02:40:46,041 --> 02:40:51,750
Forbidden though it is, I always end up with a metaphor about eyes 

1649
02:40:52,791 --> 02:40:56,083
One Paro and one, Chandramukhi 

1650
02:40:57,666 --> 02:40:59,291
One, sentimental, vivacious 

1651
02:41:00,333 --> 02:41:03,291
And you... how delicate, how demure 

1652
02:41:04,666 --> 02:41:07,500
She is fickle, like a doe, gushing like a river... 

1653
02:41:08,083 --> 02:41:13,416
the liar, the butterfly, the Moon and you...? 

1654
02:41:13,500 --> 02:41:17,833
Poem? Ballad? Some tears, sometimes fire 

1655
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:25,791
Everyone loves her. - And you, unloved by all save me? 

1656
02:41:32,750 --> 02:41:34,000
Chandramukhi. 

1657
02:41:58,333 --> 02:42:04,375
What is this, Chandramukhi? I was likening you to fortitude 

1658
02:42:05,166 --> 02:42:10,500
What you turn out to be? Wax doll? Look at you, melting away 

1659
02:42:10,958 --> 02:42:16,708
Will you let the candle melt away and cast me in dark? 

1660
02:42:25,791 --> 02:42:32,041
You've done much for me, Chandramukhi. One more favour 

1661
02:42:34,750 --> 02:42:39,833
Let me leave. - No! You know not what you suffer 

1662
02:42:39,916 --> 02:42:45,125
You know it and I suffer. - Then why must you...? 

1663
02:42:46,791 --> 02:42:50,291
I must face myself before I'm lost 

1664
02:42:52,500 --> 02:42:54,791
May a servant follow you? 

1665
02:42:58,875 --> 02:43:02,916
I cannot bear to see my death mirrored in your eyes 

1666
02:43:26,708 --> 02:43:29,291
I have been given heaven and earth 

1667
02:43:31,333 --> 02:43:33,208
Will we meet again? 

1668
02:43:46,458 --> 02:43:55,208
What the Judge of virtue and vice will pronounce for you I know not 

1669
02:43:56,708 --> 02:44:06,250
But in the afterlife, should we meet I won't be able to renounce you 

1670
02:44:29,791 --> 02:44:35,458
Deva, are we headed somewhere? Have you decided where we're going? 

1671
02:44:35,875 --> 02:44:43,416
As far as the train travels. Bombay, Delhi, Lahore, Assam 

1672
02:44:43,708 --> 02:44:46,666
I want to see all of India, are you coming with me? 

1673
02:44:47,375 --> 02:44:52,541
I'll take you around the world, if you keep up this cheer 

1674
02:44:53,708 --> 02:44:57,958
I'm cheerful, am I not? My final journey has begun 

1675
02:45:08,750 --> 02:45:14,250
Deva, what is the matter with you? - What's the matter...? 

1676
02:45:15,083 --> 02:45:16,916
Are you all right? 

1677
02:45:19,291 --> 02:45:24,666
How come you haven't left? - I'm not leaving you all alone 

1678
02:45:25,041 --> 02:45:29,958
Are you afraid I'll drink again? - Alcohol is poison for you 

1679
02:45:30,333 --> 02:45:33,166
One drop... - And I'm dead? 

1680
02:45:33,250 --> 02:45:38,708
Yes! You were delirious, that's why I didn't leave you 

1681
02:45:38,791 --> 02:45:44,666
And enough of this journey. You've had your say and I've had enough 

1682
02:45:44,750 --> 02:45:48,750
At the next station, we change the train and we go to see your mother 

1683
02:45:48,833 --> 02:45:53,708
At the next station, you go back to your compartment 

1684
02:45:53,791 --> 02:45:57,833
Why are you so stubborn? - Put out the lights 

1685
02:45:57,916 --> 02:46:03,583
And tomorrow, I'm taking you to a doctor. Always fickle 

1686
02:46:03,666 --> 02:46:05,625
Passengers to Sonarpur, Garia, Phoolbagan to detrain 

1687
02:46:18,500 --> 02:46:21,166
Dharamdas, you're back? 

1688
02:46:28,250 --> 02:46:29,375
Mr. Chunni. 

1689
02:46:29,458 --> 02:46:32,666
Friend! How are you? 

1690
02:46:32,750 --> 02:46:38,875
Small world it is, that's why we keep bumping into each other 

1691
02:46:39,166 --> 02:46:47,500
So where and how have you been? - Right here and I'm fine 

1692
02:46:49,166 --> 02:46:56,166
Tell me how you have been. - What with me, I'm soaring 

1693
02:46:56,250 --> 02:47:02,041
But you look... pale. What gives, friend? 

1694
02:47:03,333 --> 02:47:09,583
For a moment I was in a quandary. Is this my star of Chitpore? 

1695
02:47:09,666 --> 02:47:15,208
No, I'm all the same. - Even if you aren't, here I am 

1696
02:47:15,291 --> 02:47:18,291
Let's raise cheer. It's been long, let's have a party 

1697
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:23,000
So what if we aren't in a brothel? Even train compartments will do 

1698
02:47:23,333 --> 02:47:26,416
If not the dancing bells, let's cheer the rhythm of the rails 

1699
02:47:26,666 --> 02:47:30,458
If not Chandramukhi, let it be between her paramours 

1700
02:47:34,625 --> 02:47:37,000
Here you are 

1701
02:47:40,208 --> 02:47:45,541
No Chuni Babu, I don't drink. - Someone has extracted a promise? 

1702
02:47:47,083 --> 02:47:51,583
No. - Then do it, for friendship's sake 

1703
02:47:51,666 --> 02:47:55,541
After ages! Let's live it up. Why not? 

1704
02:47:55,625 --> 02:47:58,833
In a tomorrow, may we be? Might not 

1705
02:47:59,625 --> 02:48:04,208
You'll be. As for me, you never know 

1706
02:48:17,291 --> 02:48:25,291
My share of life I've lived, now I'm counting on my heart 

1707
02:48:25,625 --> 02:48:31,250
What with the world, it will even grudge you your last breath 

1708
02:48:31,333 --> 02:48:37,250
Encore! How sweet! That's poetry 

1709
02:48:37,333 --> 02:48:41,041
Shards of the heart, they call poetry. I don't care 

1710
02:48:41,416 --> 02:48:47,250
What hurts is when they want... - Encores? Wonderful 

1711
02:48:47,500 --> 02:48:52,000
Encore, encore 

1712
02:48:56,166 --> 02:48:59,291
Hey Dev Babu... 

1713
02:49:00,500 --> 02:49:02,625
what's happening? 

1714
02:49:02,708 --> 02:49:05,166
What's ailing you? Have you taken a cure? 

1715
02:49:09,916 --> 02:49:11,875
I'm incurable, Chuni Babu 

1716
02:49:18,333 --> 02:49:23,416
Then why did you drink, knowing...? - For friendship's sake, Chuni Babu 

1717
02:49:23,750 --> 02:49:30,125
Friendship? You take me for a stranger? Not again, not again... 

1718
02:49:30,208 --> 02:49:34,500
No stranger, Chuni Babu. You're the closest to me 

1719
02:49:35,875 --> 02:49:42,833
I've even imbibed your metaphor. The Sunrise of life... 

1720
02:49:42,916 --> 02:49:46,541
the salutations... then the solace... 

1721
02:49:47,250 --> 02:49:50,500
and in seconds, time takes such a turn Chuni Babu... 

1722
02:49:52,291 --> 02:49:56,958
all ties with life are severed. - No Dev Babu 

1723
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:58,666
The Sun... 

1724
02:49:58,750 --> 02:50:02,625
the song, the serenade, sympathy between friends 

1725
02:50:03,208 --> 02:50:08,708
But separation... no... - It all ends, Chuni Babu 

1726
02:50:09,416 --> 02:50:10,750
No 

1727
02:50:13,916 --> 02:50:21,041
Silence? So deathly? As if I'm dead already? 

1728
02:50:22,458 --> 02:50:24,541
I swear by our friendship... 

1729
02:50:25,666 --> 02:50:28,000
this silence... 

1730
02:50:29,166 --> 02:50:30,916
is stifling 

1731
02:50:33,250 --> 02:50:39,083
And you know Chuni Babu, miles to go... 

1732
02:50:45,291 --> 02:50:47,416
before my thirst is quenched 

1733
02:50:52,500 --> 02:50:55,791
Oh when will my thirst be quenched? 

1734
02:51:21,708 --> 02:51:24,833
What happened to Chhoti-Ma? 

1735
02:51:25,500 --> 02:51:26,833
Blood...? 

1736
02:51:48,833 --> 02:51:54,250
Pandua. Passengers to Manikpur, Mirzapur, Mirgaon, detrain 

1737
02:51:59,291 --> 02:52:01,875
"If serving me makes you happy..." 

1738
02:52:02,458 --> 02:52:09,708
"I promise you, before I die I will surely come to your doorstep" 

1739
02:52:09,791 --> 02:52:12,875
"Swear that, by me" 

1740
02:52:46,250 --> 02:52:47,291
Are we there? 

1741
02:52:47,375 --> 02:52:51,750
The journey has just begun. What's wrong with you? 

1742
02:52:54,333 --> 02:52:59,000
Devdas... come to me, my darling 

1743
02:53:08,375 --> 02:53:12,208
All day tramping around the village with that Paro 

1744
02:53:12,291 --> 02:53:14,833
Not another moment for you in this house 

1745
02:53:15,750 --> 02:53:16,791
Get out! 

1746
02:53:17,208 --> 02:53:23,708
Deva! I'm not letting you leave! - Dharamdas! Don't let him go 

1747
02:53:25,375 --> 02:53:27,416
Stop Dev 

1748
02:53:41,375 --> 02:53:44,666
Faster, please 

1749
02:53:45,791 --> 02:53:47,416
Very little time left 

1750
02:53:47,666 --> 02:53:49,000
Yes sir 

1751
02:53:56,500 --> 02:54:00,416
Babu-ji said leave the village. Everyone said, leave Paro 

1752
02:54:00,500 --> 02:54:05,708
Paro said, leave drinking. Now you say, leave this house 

1753
02:54:05,791 --> 02:54:10,750
One day, He will say, leave this world 

1754
02:54:16,083 --> 02:54:21,375
Here's Manikpur. Brought you in before sun-up 

1755
02:54:24,041 --> 02:54:25,250
Huh! Sir. 

1756
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:28,000
Sir... sir! 

1757
02:54:28,291 --> 02:54:29,833
Whom are you seeing in Manikpur? 

1758
02:54:35,458 --> 02:54:36,791
Paro. 

1759
02:54:42,500 --> 02:54:43,833
Who...? 

1760
02:54:44,458 --> 02:54:46,125
I'm here, Paro 

1761
02:55:18,500 --> 02:55:22,750
What is the matter, Parvati? - Someone called out to me 

1762
02:55:23,875 --> 02:55:29,791
So late at night? Go to bed. You must be mistaken 

1763
02:55:41,958 --> 02:55:44,208
Picked him up at Pandua station. I don't know... 

1764
02:55:44,291 --> 02:55:48,000
something happened to him overnight. Never said where to, in Manikpur 

1765
02:55:56,166 --> 02:56:00,041
What's that crowd outside? 

1766
02:56:00,125 --> 02:56:05,875
Some stranger has been lying there all night. Counting his last, maybe 

1767
02:56:05,958 --> 02:56:10,875
Poor soul, must've come to return something he owed in this lifetime 

1768
02:56:14,083 --> 02:56:16,333
God rest his soul 

1769
02:56:21,041 --> 02:56:24,000
No chance of survival, Mahendra Babu 

1770
02:56:24,833 --> 02:56:26,791
He's breathing his last 

1771
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,208
"She is manifest in Death" 

1772
02:56:33,291 --> 02:56:37,333
"She is the life-force" 

1773
02:57:05,750 --> 02:57:07,500
What is the matter, Parvati? 

1774
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,875
These letters might provide a clue 

1775
02:57:14,958 --> 02:57:18,125
"She is Eternal peace" 

1776
02:57:22,291 --> 02:57:29,666
If you are inattentive Parvati, you needn't say the prayers. Leave 

1777
02:57:33,166 --> 02:57:37,208
For some wish unfulfilled, must be, he isn't giving up his ghost 

1778
02:57:37,291 --> 02:57:43,416
The policeman has identified him. He's from some Tal Sonapur 

1779
02:57:44,083 --> 02:57:45,500
Tal Sonapur 

1780
02:57:46,500 --> 02:57:49,041
What's the name? - I don't know 

1781
02:57:49,125 --> 02:57:52,458
Mahendra Babu knows. - Will you please call Mahendra? 

1782
02:57:52,541 --> 02:57:53,916
Alright. 

1783
02:57:56,625 --> 02:57:59,458
I said, call Mahendra. - Yes 

1784
02:58:05,833 --> 02:58:07,458
Mr. Mahendra! Hey Mr. Mahendra! 

1785
02:58:07,541 --> 02:58:11,666
Yes? - Chhoti-Ma wants to see you. Now 

1786
02:58:25,500 --> 02:58:30,875
Yes Chhoti-Ma? You summoned me? - Yes, who's the man lying outside? 

1787
02:58:30,958 --> 02:58:33,291
Someone from your village, one Devdas Mukherjee 

1788
02:58:37,208 --> 02:58:40,166
Who? - Devdas Mukherjee 

1789
02:58:46,416 --> 02:58:48,583
How do you know? - Two letters in his pocket 

1790
02:58:48,666 --> 02:58:50,625
One, to Dwijdas Mukherjee. - His elder brother 

1791
02:58:50,708 --> 02:58:52,375
And to one Kaushalya. - Yes, his mother 

1792
02:58:52,458 --> 02:58:54,625
The name was tattooed on his arm. - At a fair. It rained 

1793
02:58:54,708 --> 02:58:56,958
Incomplete tattoo... - Also a torn necklace of pearls 

1794
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:58,916
Hit me here... 

1795
02:59:05,500 --> 02:59:07,291
Where are you going Chhoti-Ma? 

1796
02:59:07,375 --> 02:59:08,916
By now they must've taken him away 

1797
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:10,458
Mahendra! 

1798
02:59:14,791 --> 02:59:18,958
Chhoti-Ma, stop... 

1799
02:59:20,791 --> 02:59:24,666
Chhoti-Ma, stop... 

1800
02:59:25,041 --> 02:59:27,375
Chhoti-Ma, stop... 

1801
02:59:28,791 --> 02:59:32,000
What happened to Chhoti Ma? - What's going on in this house? 

1802
02:59:32,041 --> 02:59:34,583
Why this screaming? What's up Mahendra? 

1803
02:59:34,666 --> 02:59:39,416
Ma is going out! For some Devdas! - She has gone insane, stop her 

1804
02:59:39,500 --> 02:59:42,000
Stop, Parvati! 

1805
02:59:42,208 --> 02:59:45,000
Don't let her step outside the manor 

1806
02:59:53,958 --> 02:59:56,916
Arre O'Deva 

1807
03:00:01,583 --> 03:00:05,458
Arre O'Deva 

1808
03:00:14,791 --> 03:00:17,916
Stop Chhoti-Ma 

1809
03:00:18,791 --> 03:00:22,625
Stop! Babu-ji forbids you 

1810
03:00:23,958 --> 03:00:26,625
Chhoti-Ma, stop... 

1811
03:00:36,958 --> 03:00:40,666
Arre O'Deva 

1812
03:00:40,750 --> 03:00:45,166
Secure the doors 

1813
03:00:52,875 --> 03:00:55,791
Arre O'Deva 

1814
03:01:11,250 --> 03:01:13,583
Arre O'Deva 

1815
03:01:15,791 --> 03:01:18,875
Arre O'Deva 

1816
03:01:24,625 --> 03:01:26,375
Paro. 

1817
03:01:36,333 --> 03:01:40,000
"Where will I find again..." 

1818
03:01:40,791 --> 03:01:42,500
"my lost innocence..." 

1819
03:01:44,041 --> 03:01:46,083
"my lost dreams..." 

1820
03:01:47,083 --> 03:01:48,916
"my lost childhood" 

1821
03:01:50,166 --> 03:01:52,083
"Where is gone the shade of trees..." 

1822
03:01:52,916 --> 03:01:54,833
"where I made myself a home?"
