1
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,330
Wow! Very good... very good.

2
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,950
All of you are laughing a lot.

3
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,620
How happy you look?

4
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,750
It seems all of you are single.

5
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,450
We Gujarati people buy any
useless thing if we get money.

6
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,410
One of my friends bought
a bag worth Rs. 30,000.

7
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,500
Another friend bought
a smart watch worth Rs. 60,000.

8
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,870
A man bought an entire bank...

9
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,500
...and another Gujarati man
bought an entire vote bank.

10
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,660
No... but seriously!
A smart watch worth Rs. 60,000..

11
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,950
..and what do you do with it?

12
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,080
Basically smart watch
is just like a boyfriend.

13
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,250
Both are very expensive,
are showpieces, and are never of any use.

14
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:15,540
No no! Sorry... 
sorry sometimes they are of use.

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,330
I mean... Smart watches.

16
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,250
On top of it 
this species called boyfriend.

17
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,410
So forgetful.

18
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,410
He forgets his girlfriend's birthday.

19
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,830
He forgets the anniversary.

20
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,330
He forgets to bring his wallet.

21
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,660
Sometimes he even
forgets to earn money.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That's right. That's right

23
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,450
But everybody perfectly
remembers that...

24
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,830
...in the final match at
Sharjah on 24th April, 1998...

25
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,830
...Sachin Tendulkar scored
134 runs against Australia...

26
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,040
..which included 12 fours and 3 sixes,
won Man of the Match...

27
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,950
...and made 1894 OD
runs to create a record.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Sachin... Sachin... Sachin... Sachin!

29
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,950
Well all the committed
girls raise your hand.

30
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,120
Oh did you see?

31
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,830
Mostly only those on the cheap
seats at the back are committed.

32
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:07,040
See, being in a relationship
is like driving a car.

33
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,080
A car consumes petrol.
A boyfriend consumes inner peace.

34
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,000
You can bang a car.
A boyfriend can't be...

35
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,700
If you date him he will
think that you will marry him.

36
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,370
We may learn driving on a piece of junk
but does it mean we should buy it?

37
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,450
And the most important thing.

38
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,120
Apply brakes if you see
danger ahead while driving a car.

39
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,080
And what if you see danger
ahead in a relationship?

40
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,040
Yes... break up!
That's all for tonight guys.

41
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,540
I hope all of you enjoyed it 
and if you did enjoy...

42
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,290
...please subscribe to my
Tik Tok profile, funnyharshita.

This is Harshita signing off.

45
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,620
Thank you for being
such a lovely audience.

46
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,160
-Harshita one selfie.
-Oh sure. Thank you.

47
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,950
-Ma'am one photo.
-Thank you so much. Oh yeah sure sure.

48
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,700
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry.

49
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,870
Excuse me. Sorry sorry.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,080
Just a minute.

51
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,660
Excuse me. Sorry... sorry. Sorry... sorry.

52
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,000
Sorry guys.

53
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,750
Sahil. Sahil 
where are you going? Wait.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,830
-Listen to me.
-Don't touch me.

55
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,750
What?

56
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,410
I heard it.

57
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,870
And not just me...
all the others also heard it.

58
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,040
-What? -And tomorrow the whole world
will hear on the internet..

59
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,870
..how your boyfriend is useless
and good-for-nothing. I heard it.

60
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,000
When did I say so?

61
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,290
You said it just two minutes ago.

62
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,450
Madam it was fun.

63
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,410
-Mind blowing.
-Hi! Myself Sahil.

64
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,660
I am her boyfriend.

65
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,370
Didn't she say that I am
useless and good-for-nothing?

66
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,580
-Didn't she say so? Tell me.
-Please go.

67
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,000
The parking attendant will
charge double. Go. Please go.

68
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,040
I was talking about
boyfriends in general okay?

69
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,500
To make people laugh.

70
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,750
I see.

71
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,160
Now I understand your plan.

72
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,790
-You want to provoke me right?
That you... -What is your problem...

73
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:04,290
Sahil, I can't tolerate
your daily misunderstandings.

74
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,580
And I cannot tolerate you.

75
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,950
What do you want to do?

76
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,000
I want to end it.

77
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,540
You will be free
and I too will be free.

78
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,000
So everything will end, right?

79
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay fine. Okay.

80
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,830
Didn't you want this?

81
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,660
Didn't you want this?
Didn't you want this?

82
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,000
Hey, have you gone crazy?

83
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,580
There is a problem if I say something.

84
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,000
There is a problem
if I don't say something.

85
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,750
Sahil, what is your problem?

86
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,870
Look at yourself.

87
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,660
Harshita 
why have you changed so much?

88
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,410
Because you don't
mend your ways Sahil.

89
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,290
I am fine the way I am!

90
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,160
Maybe your choice has changed!

91
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,120
'What happened was very wrong.'

92
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,410
'Was the time wrong or was it her?'

93
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,200
'Yes she was wrong.'

94
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,080
-Come on... give me the bag.
-Here. Take this.

95
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,250
Quickly.

96
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,160
Mister, drinking
liquor openly is banned.

97
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,330
For that matter plastic
bags are also banned. Go away.

98
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,700
Why should I bother?

99
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,370
'She ended the love of
two years in just two minutes?'

100
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,000
Hi. How are you all?

101
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,330
Well first of all tell
me how many of you are Gujarati?

102
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,160
Who else would be there in Ahmedabad?

103
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,950
Wow! So all are Gujarati.

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,500
So all of you must have
brought food from home right?

105
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,040
How cute?

106
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,080
If I say in Kolkata 
that all the Bengalis in the house...

107
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,870
...make some noise 
then all of them would go oolululu!

108
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,580
I was teaching Hindi...
sorry Gujarati to my Bengali friend.

109
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,540
I told her that when
she meets anybody...

110
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,290
...she should ask
'kem chaale chhe' (how is it going?)

111
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,750
She had the habit of
pausing at the wrong place.

112
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,000
She asked a boy 
'kem chaale chhe? (Well are you coming?)

113
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,370
The boy asked her what is your name?

114
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,370
She replied Aa chal (come along).

115
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,160
-My friend Anchal bought
the dress I am wearing. -Hey you!

116
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,410
-Yes sir?
-Play some nice music.

117
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,620
Yes sir.

118
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,160
How many of you are scared of escalators?

119
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,450
My mother..

120
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,250
My... my mother is so scared that...

121
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,700
Hello.

122
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,000
She is so irritating.

123
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,080
Thank you.

124
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,200
Waiter, give me a Jain garlic bread.

125
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,290
Garlic bread cannot be prepared in Jain style.

126
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,830
-How rude that was?
-Hi.

127
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,330
Samosu.

128
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,910
What?

129
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,790
Sahil Mohanbhai Sutaria.

130
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,660
My name.

131
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,160
Mosu always says that...

132
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,000
...gargling completely
cools down a person's anger.

133
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,410
Who is Mosu?

134
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,330
Mohanbhai Sutaria. My father.

135
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,330
Here everybody says my old man.

136
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,450
-Gargling cools down
a person's anger. -Yes.

137
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,660
-And sneezing three times
cures acidity. -Yes.

138
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,040
-Is your father a doctor?
-He is a character.

139
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,080
But this is guaranteed okay?

140
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,080
I am telling the truth.
Once, try it just once.

141
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,700
I will look like an idiot, okay?

142
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,080
People would laugh at me.

143
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,660
Just five minutes ago
nobody laughed right?

144
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,620
I mean don't feel offended 
but aren't you angry about that?

145
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,450
That is why I am telling you.

146
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,370
Do try it just once.

147
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,500
I insist.

148
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,660
Usually I fall in love with a girl
who is getting wet in the rain...'

149
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,580
...or who is drying her hair.'

150
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,830
'For the first time I fell in love
with a girl on seeing her gargling.'

151
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,540
How much should I pay you?

152
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,450
Oh money.

153
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,370
Say thanks to Mosu.

154
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,950
-When is it?
-What?

155
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,700
When is the next show?

156
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,620
Why? Did you like my jokes so much?

157
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,200
I liked you.

158
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,950
Day after tomorrow
at 8 o'clock in the night.

159
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,000
Does any one of you party at night?

160
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,410
Or like go at 12 o'clock
in the night and do disco dance?

161
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,620
Some...

162
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,830
Thank you.

163
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:21,540
Something is getting
connected somewhere.

164
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:30,870
A favourite sweet dish
is being cooked.

165
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:38,330
Something is getting
connected somewhere.

166
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:47,160
A favourite sweet dish
is being cooked.

167
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,410
'From favourite films to
distasteful vegetable curries.'

168
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,790
'From what is bedtime to
how you feel lazy to wake up.'

169
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,750
Which animal is better,
a dog or a cat?'

170
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,830
'From the tattoo design
to the most ticklish part.'

171
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,160
Sending innumerable
messages to each other...'

172
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,410
...between morning's first
tea to the night's last coffee.'

173
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,040
'All this had happened between us.'

174
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,410
Something is getting
connected somewhere.

175
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,750
A favourite sweet dish
is being cooked.

176
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:26,120
The days are happy and full of fun.

177
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,410
The mind is enchanted
and is getting sweet punishment.

178
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,540
Everything feels good for no reason.

179
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,870
Everything feels good for no reason.

180
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:47,370
This is a mistake which feels right.

181
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,540
-Josu!
-Who is Josu?

182
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,290
Jyotsna Sutaria my mother.

183
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,700
What is going on?

184
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:02,540
No mother, we were just... walk just...

185
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,250
Are you walking holding her hand?

186
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,200
Doesn't she know how to walk?

187
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,290
Is she a small child?

188
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,790
No mother. I mean I mean...

189
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,250
Who is she?

190
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,120
The headlight is broken.

191
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,330
I mean...

192
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,700
-What does it mean?
-Mother it is not what you think.

193
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,330
Don't argue son. Who is she?

194
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,790
She...

195
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,330
She is... a friend. She is my friend.

196
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,250
Do friends hold hands and
walk publically on the road?

197
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,160
Tell me honestly. Who is she?

198
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,000
She is my special friend.

199
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,540
How special?

200
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,870
Mother I mean...

201
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,910
-Are you having an affair?
-Mother?

202
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,620
What?

203
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,450
-Are you listening? Come here.
-Hey.

204
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,160
Look these two are having an affair.

205
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,080
Really? Amazing.

206
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,790
Dear what is your name?

207
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,250
-Harshita.
-I see.

208
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,000
Why didn't you tell me?

209
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,000
Yes you should keep us informed.

210
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,330
We realised it just now.

211
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,660
But mother 
why are you panicking so much?

212
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,950
She has a right to panic Sahil.
She is your mother.

213
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,500
-Look at that!
-Of course.

214
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Have we ever restrained you?

215
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,040
Since we are your parents 
isn't it your duty to inform us?

216
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,040
-Yes.
-Right?

217
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,620
-Right dear?
-Right aunt.

218
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,580
What is right?

219
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,120
We have confirmed it just now.

220
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,250
-Yes, but...
-What is right?

221
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,290
Mother I...

222
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,580
Father why are you
not saying anything?

223
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,000
-What?
-It is your fault.

224
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,950
Yes.

225
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,160
Say sorry.

226
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,410
-Sorry.
-That's it.

227
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,790
Now you say sorry to me.

228
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,120
-Why me?
-Didn't you bang my scooter?

229
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,830
It is your fault.

230
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,750
You are enthusiastic about
teaching me to ride the scooter.

231
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,120
Are you learning to ride the scooter?

232
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,450
-That's really cool.
-What!

233
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,700
-Did you find it cool?
-Yes.

234
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,790
-I find her cool.
-Really?

235
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,250
Come dear we will drop you home.

236
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,000
-Okay.
-Let us go.

237
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,410
Come.

238
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,200
-What do you do dear?
-What do you do dear?

239
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,410
I am a stand-up comic.

240
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,120
-What does it mean?
-It is like a gathering.

241
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,000
My mind is charmed by you.'

242
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,540
A favourite sweet dish
is being cooked.

243
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,040
For no reason...

244
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,080
For no reason...

245
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,000
Something is getting
connected somewhere.

246
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,330
A favourite sweet dish
is being cooked.

247
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:44,750
The days are happy and full of fun.

248
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:49,000
The mind is enchanted
and is getting sweet punishment.

249
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,080
Everything feels good for no reason.

250
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,410
Everything feels good for no reason.

251
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:05,370
This is a mistake which feels right.

252
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,200
Hey, mother...

253
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,080
-Hi son.
-What has happened to you?

254
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,750
-I fell down.
-Oh God! So who cooks food?

255
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:38,580
-Your special friend.
-Not special friend mother.

256
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,330
Your future daughter-in-law.

257
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,870
Hello!

258
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,160
-Hi!
-Hello. Hi.

259
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,620
What are you cooking?

260
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,950
Piping hot fritters. Come soon.

261
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I too have got fritters. Look.

262
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,370
Oh no.

263
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,330
Happy first anniversary.

264
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,080
-Oh my God!
-Hey, surprise!

265
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
-How did you like it?
-How did you come?

266
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,660
-By plane baby.
-Not that.

267
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,660
Weren't you supposed
to come after six months?

268
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,000
I completed one year's
job in six months...

269
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,250
...so the seniors were
happy and told me to go home.

270
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,580
-And you are my home baby.
-Oh my God.

271
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,000
I can't believe this.

272
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,660
Our memories...

273
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:27,120
Our chats...

274
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:35,910
Days and nights are not enough.

275
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,120
Whatever I eat tastes sweet.

276
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,160
Whatever I eat tastes sweet.

277
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:52,700
Time bestows such gifts in a moment.

278
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:56,750
Someone is uniting with me.

279
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,120
A favourite sweet dish
is being cooked.

280
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,160
For no reason...

281
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,620
For no reason...

282
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,000
For no reason...

283
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,030
I surrender to Lord Krishna.
I surrender to Lord Krishna.

284
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:40,820
I surrender to Lord Krishna.
I surrender to Lord Krishna.

285
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,530
O God.

286
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:49,400
I surrender to Lord Krishna.
I surrender to Lord Krishna.

287
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,030
I surrender to Lord Krishna...

288
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,610
Lord Ganesha...

289
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,320
'And another Gujarati man
bought an entire vote bank.'

290
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,530
No but seriously 
a smart watch worth Rs. 60,000...'

291
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,070
-'...and what do you do with it?'
-Oh God!

292
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,280
'Basically smart watch
is just like a boyfriend.'

293
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,530
-Hasu is very funny.
-'Both are very expensive...'

294
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,570
...are showpieces
and are never of use.'

295
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,320
Mother, turn off the video
and give me tea.

296
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,320
'And it is of use also.'

297
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,150
-'On top of it this species
called boyfriend.' -Mother.

298
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,110
'So forgetful.'

299
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,990
-Yes?
-Give me tea.

300
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,900
-Serve yourself.
-Serve it here.

301
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,280
He forgets to bring a gift.
Sometimes...'

302
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,740
Oh no...

303
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,900
She sits there and keeps laughing.

304
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,530
You and your maternal uncle...

305
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,110
...both want everything
to be handed to them.

306
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,150
-Here take this.
-Give.

307
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,030
Sit up and drink.

308
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,700
You are harassing me.

309
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,400
Sit up and drink.

310
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,950
Where were you the whole night?

311
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,860
At Ru.. Rutvik's house.

312
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,240
Son, don't shake legs in the morning.

313
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,030
'Lakshmi' (wealth)
won't come into the house.

314
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,860
Lakshmi comes in the morning.

315
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:46,240
Lakshmi comes in the afternoon.
Lakshmi comes in the evening.

316
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,820
Mother do one thing.

317
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,150
Give me the timetable for
Lakshmi's arrival and departure.

318
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,990
Accordingly I will shake my legs.

319
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,780
Why are you getting irritated?

320
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,610
Your father has returned.

321
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,950
-Hello sister-in-law.
-Hello.

322
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,820
-Both the brothers are here?
-Yes.

323
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,030
-Oh wow she has come back home?
-Very good!

324
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,950
What? She has come?

325
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,150
Sister-in-law 
you should say it has come.

326
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,280
Its gender is not feminine right?

327
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,490
Brother he loves it more than me.

328
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,820
-Oh! -So for me
its gender is feminine right?

329
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,200
Still you should not say so.

330
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,860
-It was because of it...
-We got married.

331
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,280
-Yes.
-I know.

332
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,740
-Do you know why I don't
get rid of this scooter? -Yes.

333
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,110
Because this scooter
keeps reminding me...

334
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,530
...that the value of relations
and things do not diminish...

335
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,320
...when they become old.

336
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,950
They become invaluable.

337
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,820
Just like our romance of 28 years.

338
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,200
What nonsense?

339
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,860
You are becoming romantic
in front of Tribhuvanbhai.

340
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,610
I didn't see and hear anything.

341
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,990
You can continue.

342
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,740
-Bye see you in the evening.
-What is there in the evening?

343
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,030
Just like that.

344
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,360
-It is Sunday so everybody
do get together. -Oh!

345
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,240
Bye!

346
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,700
-Bye!
-Bye.

347
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,740
Come.

348
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,320
-Oh the boss has returned?
-Yes he has returned.

349
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,820
Well my friend 
how was the funny night?

350
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,030
-Mother.
-Yes?

351
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,990
Why there is less sugar in the tea?

352
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,700
Harshita said that too
much sugar in tea is not good.

353
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,320
-I see.
-Yes.

354
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,860
So Harshita is going to
decide what is good or bad for us.

355
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,280
I am going to sleep.

356
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,900
Listen.

357
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:42,070
Before you go to bed tell Harshita
that we are going out for lunch...

358
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,740
...so she should not
make some other plan.

359
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,650
Harshita won't come.

360
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,070
Why?

361
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,200
We broke off.

362
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,070
What has happened?

363
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,610
Break-off.

364
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,740
What is it?

365
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,490
Earlier we were together
and now we are not.

366
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,530
What? I didn't understand.

367
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,990
It is like earlier Harshita
and I were together...

368
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,820
...and now Harshita and I
are not together.

369
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,740
What does it mean Sahil?

370
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,570
Speak in words I can understand.

371
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,650
Mother it is like earlier
Harshita and I were together...

372
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,570
...and now Harshita and I
are not together!

373
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,150
Both had a fight.

374
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,320
Father!

375
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,530
Our relationship is broken.

376
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,650
What do you mean it is broken?

377
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,030
Sahil you are going to get married!

378
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,740
What is this boy saying?

379
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,740
'Hello where are you lost?'

380
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,820
'Do help me in fixing the curtain.'

381
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:58,860
'Hey!'

382
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:05,110
'May I know why you
have changed this curtain?'

383
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,490
'Because this curtain is
from your great grandfather's time.'

384
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,570
'Are you going to crack
such jokes after marriage?'

385
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,860
'Decide whether you
want to get married or not.'

386
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,610
'There is so much work.
Don’t stare at me. Come here.'

387
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,530
'What is the problem
with the bedsheet?'

388
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,530
'Hello this is not bedsheet.'

389
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,900
'It is a multi-course feast.
Look at this.'

390
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,740
'Yesterday's cottage cheese curry.'

391
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,740
This...'

392
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,700
-'Hey.
-Saturday's rice and curry.'

393
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,360
-'And this one I don't even
know what it is. -Taste it.'

394
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:43,490
'Yuck! It looks like fusion
of bread-lentil and pasta Arabiata.'

395
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,610
'Now it will look like a room.'

396
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,780
'How much more interior
designing remains?'

397
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,110
'This clock is the last one.'

398
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,700
'Who looks at a clock in today’s time?
Don't we have mobiles?'

399
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,700
'Keep the mobile 10 feet
away before going to bed okay?'

400
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,070
'But why are you pushing me?'

401
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,990
'Moments should be forgotten
when they become memories.'

402
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,610
'But when things become memories?'

403
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,860
They should be torn,
broken, burnt and thrown in garbage.'

404
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,200
Harshita brought each
and everything in this room.'

405
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,110
'Even this T-shirt.'

406
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,530
Your mother is making piping
hot pancakes. Come down to eat.

407
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,990
Okay.

408
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,110
Are you crying?

409
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,740
No.

410
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,950
Then come let us have tasty pancakes.

411
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,030
Go ahead I will come.

412
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,400
No your mother told me
to bring you along.

413
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,320
I am naked. Naked.

414
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,740
Shall I come? Shall I come as I am?

415
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,530
No!

416
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,200
You come after getting ready.

417
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,030
Why after getting ready?

418
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,400
We have to talk.

419
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,240
About what?

420
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:55,360
About your break-off.

421
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,650
I don't want to talk.

422
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,900
You don't have an option my friend.

423
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,700
Your mother does want to talk to you.

424
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,280
-I will come down.
-Okay.

425
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:12,150
-I will speak a little about break-off.
-Okay.

426
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,610
I will eat a couple of pancakes...

427
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,150
...and then I will come
upstairs and go to sleep.

428
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,610
Cool.

429
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,450
Father. Father 
don't call up Harshita okay?

430
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,490
-Okay.
-What okay?

431
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,360
I was not going to call
her up but your idea is not bad.

432
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,610
Father don't call her up okay?

433
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,240
You are under the
oath of your scooter.

434
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,780
Oh no.

435
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,650
Fine. I won't call her up.

436
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:57,280
If you find it uncomfortable
then sit here. I...

437
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,200
Why? I am not sitting
here to give any preaching.

438
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,570
-No no. It is just...
-What?

439
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,860
-It means that...
-What?

440
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,950
Start.

441
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,070
Hello. Manjula?

442
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:18,400
Okay listen.

443
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,490
-What is this father?
-Bring the ironed clothes when you come.

444
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,400
And listen 
we are not going to have lunch today...

445
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,240
...so there won't
be utensils to clean...

446
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,110
-...but do come to sweep
and mop the house. -Hurry up.

447
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,150
And I have started the machine...

448
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,650
...so hang out the clothes to dry.

449
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,400
You are very forgetful.

450
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,450
Yes.

451
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,280
-Hello.
-She can't give up talking.

452
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,950
I won't talk now.
I am in a preaching.

453
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,780
I am busy.
I will disconnect the phone.

454
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,650
I will talk later. Bye.

455
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:48,610
-Just a minute. Please put it on silent.
-Give me the phone.

456
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,030
-Hold it.
-Yes.

457
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,280
It is silent now.

458
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,740
Start.

459
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,740
-So...
-Just a minute.

460
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,570
Before we start...

461
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,200
-...shall we call Harshita here?
-No.

462
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,070
-Why?
-Why should she come to our house?

463
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,860
Father tell me why should
she come to our house to discuss?

464
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:16,280
No I mean just like you
are going to present your side...

465
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,950
...she too should
present her side to us.

466
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,610
So we can settle the issue.

467
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,280
It has been settled mother.

468
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,700
It has been settled completely.
I am just sharing it with you.

469
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,030
Just informing you that's all.

470
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,280
FYI.

471
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,610
What do you mean?

472
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,740
FYI means for your information.

473
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,700
That is why I tell you
to watch English movies with me.

474
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,700
It is very important
to understand their language...

475
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,570
...in order to understand these people.

476
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,570
Yes.

477
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,650
But we have already informed
our relatives. What now?

478
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,070
Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother.

479
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,740
Why are you panicking?

480
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,280
What is the need to panic?

481
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,280
Why are you panicking so much?

482
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,900
-Should you get panicked so much? Why...
-Listen listen...

483
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,990
Relax. Relax.

484
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,240
Relax.

485
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:00,860
Okay?

486
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,400
Restart.

487
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,110
Father!

488
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,700
Harshita is not what she was earlier.

489
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,700
Try to understand. Along with
her ideas her plans have also changed.

490
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:17,280
Harshita has now no interest
in family or marriage...

491
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,280
...or in living with me.

492
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,280
Don't run so fast.

493
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,490
-Hey...
-You will hurt your knees.

494
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,740
What are you doing?

495
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,820
Fine. Let them hurt.

496
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:32,700
-Okay listen.
-Yes?

497
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,030
I have decided to go to Mumbai.

498
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:36,570
You will reach there
if you run at this speed.

499
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,650
This is the problem with you.
You don't take anything seriously.

500
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,700
I have decided to go to Mumbai.

501
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,320
It will be good for my career.

502
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,320
The whole industry is there.

503
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,740
I have taken a couple
membership for two years.

504
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,740
I mean what is the need to go there?

505
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,200
Isn't everything
going on fine over here?

506
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,320
I don't want to stagnate.

507
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,990
I want to make progress.

508
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,150
Currently each of my videos is getting
100 thousand to 150 thousand views.

509
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,780
I will go there will meet
people and perform at various places...

510
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,150
...then one zero will be added.

511
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,990
But Mumbai and the film
industry over there are not safe.

512
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:22,150
Safe! I am not a little girl.

513
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,700
Harshita,
my mother and father are making plans…

514
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,200
…for marriage and
engagement and other things.

515
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,400
So tell them that
you are still not ready.

516
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,400
Now tell me.
She thinks that I am not ready.

517
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:40,950
You may be ready 
but your pocket might not be ready.

518
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,240
Children from now on
he will teach you accounts.

519
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:50,070
Good morning Sahil sir.

520
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:53,280
-Sahil. Sahil. Sahil will be fine.
-Hey!

521
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,200
He had scored 100 out of
100 in accounts in Third Year.

522
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,400
He is a gold medalist from IIM.
A gold medalist.

523
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:04,530
Children in your life
you have to become like Sahil.

524
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:08,860
Hard working,
focused and career oriented.

525
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,740
Tell me will you do that?

526
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,610
-How is the enthusiasm?
-High sir!

527
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,950
Who said it? Who said it?

528
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,280
What is it?

529
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,450
Since the past 20 minutes I have
been staring at you like an idiot.

530
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:22,900
Do show some reaction.

531
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,820
You are sitting with
earphones stuck in your ears.

532
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,950
Tonight is my first show
with Comedy Factory okay?

533
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,030
I'm really nervous.

534
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,280
So I am watching their YouTube videos.

535
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,650
I'm doing my homework.

536
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,530
I see. I don't give
homework to my students.

537
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,740
I finish everything
in the classroom only.

538
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,490
I too crack jokes. People laugh also.

539
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,610
That too without a mike.

540
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:51,030
Harshita I suggest do
perform once without a mike.

541
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,820
You see nothing should
come between us and the audience.

542
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,860
Not even the mic.

543
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,950
Mr. Sahil I know how to do my work.

544
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:03,030
1000 to 2000 followers are
not increasing just like that.

545
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,820
Even today I received
104 friend requests.

546
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,070
Sahil there is no competition
here.

547
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,450
Where is the competition?

548
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,860
How can there be a competition?

549
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,820
I mean your career is different.
Mine is different.

550
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,490
What is your career?

551
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,820
Oh! Hello. Oh have you arrived?

552
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,610
-Who has come?
-Okay, I am coming.

553
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,950
Okay. Bye-bye.

554
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,610
-Why did you order coffee for me?
-Who has come?

555
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,280
Dhwani Gautam.

556
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,860
He is a very famous director...

557
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,900
...and he also owns a
talent management company.

558
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,950
He has fixed tonight's
show for me so, bye.

559
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,740
Why bye? Tell him to wait.

560
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,570
I have ordered chocolate
ganache with vanilla ice cream.

561
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,030
-Money will go waste.
-Sahil I cannot ask him to wait.

562
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,950
He is going to get
me the next shows okay?

563
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,200
You know what the difference
between latte and cappuccino is?

564
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,950
-Let’s order lemonade.
-And it is not ganache. Ganash.

565
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,030
A person gets busy with work.

566
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,400
Father I have no objection
if she gets busy...

567
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:16,570
...but so busy that she
won't pick up my phone call?

568
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,200
-Hello.
-Are you awake?

569
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,740
-What time is it?
-Two o'clock.

570
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,280
Two o'clock?

571
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,650
Hello! Doesn't your
show end at 11 o'clock?

572
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,740
Yes yes... it ended at 11
o'clock but then we stayed back.

573
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,150
-Why?
-To discuss the next show.

574
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,400
You should tell them that you
won't sit and discuss at midnight.

575
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,650
Why be out till two o'clock?

576
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,200
You should finish
everything by evening.

577
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,900
Can we talk about
something else please?

578
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,990
Tell me how was your day?

579
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:57,320
You know? Today YouTube gave me the
award of fastest 1,00,000 subscribers.

580
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,780
They have sent a trophy home.

581
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,530
Congratulations but we were
going to talk about something else.

582
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,490
How was your day?

583
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:06,900
I woke up in the morning.

584
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,450
I had breakfast.

585
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,280
I went to the gym. Alone.

586
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,900
I watched the match. Had a bath.

587
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,400
I called you up.
You didn't receive it.

588
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,700
Harshita,
we haven't met since past eight days.

589
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,990
Sorry my Samosu.

590
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,950
We will plan something soon okay?

591
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,820
Why soon? Tomorrow morning we were
supposed to have breakfast together.

592
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,950
I won't be able to come.
I am very tired.

593
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,200
Okay I will disconnect. Okay bye.

594
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:47,490
Not just Harshita but
her world had also changed.

595
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,150
And I was nowhere in that world.

596
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:57,280
Son, do you want plain or spicy?

597
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,030
Mother give me anything.

598
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,610
-Wow.
-Here.

599
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:09,950
Wouldn't it be easy for me to serve
if you sat with your father?

600
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,320
Here.

601
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,110
But I want only one.

602
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,860
Eat it. There is lots of batter.

603
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,780
I made provision for
Harshita also while preparing it.

604
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:24,030
But how would I know that both
of you will get divorced suddenly?

605
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,780
Do eat it or else there
will be some leftovers.

606
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,200
Let there be leftovers.

607
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,150
Sister the work is finished.

608
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,780
Have you hung out clothes
for drying from the machine?

609
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,700
Again you forgot?

610
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:37,700
Go and hang them out to dry.

611
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,900
-Listen.
-Yes?

612
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:42,150
Later come and eat pancakes.
There is lots of batter.

613
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,070
What batter? Mother just a minute.

614
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,280
Mother just a minute.

615
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,070
Come here. Come here. Come here.

616
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,610
There is a great difference
between divorce and breakup.

617
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,240
What is the difference?

618
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:01,200
Both are different things.

619
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,700
So explain to me how
the two are different.

620
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:10,900
Father please say something.

621
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,490
I would like to have one pancake.

622
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,110
And listen if you can make
something like 'Mysore Masala'...

623
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,860
-...I would relish it.
-Okay.

624
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,240
What Mysore Masala?

625
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,820
Such minor fights do take place.

626
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,570
Minor fights?

627
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,610
Father when it was the
first anniversary of our love...

628
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,530
...I had come here from Boston.

629
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,110
Why? To surprise her.

630
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,490
But on the second anniversary
she wants to party not with me...

631
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:38,530
...but with the people
of Comedy Factory.

632
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,110
Acting smart.

633
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,530
Is the party over?

634
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,030
Who are you?

635
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,070
Where are you all?

636
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,070
Are you okay?

637
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,860
Do you want to drink water?

638
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,950
Drink a little.

639
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,900
Relax.

640
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,820
Move aside.

641
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,700
Sahil. Hi Sahil.

642
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,950
This is Harshita in the house.

643
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,700
Where were you? Where were you?

644
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,610
-At Manan's party.
-Do you go to party?

645
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,360
Don't get angry. Don't get angry.
Here gargle.

646
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,700
-Gargle.
-Harshita.

647
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,360
Harshita are you okay?

648
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:38,320
Hey move away. Keep away.

649
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,030
This is too much.

650
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,240
It was so much fun.

651
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,740
Hey Sahil
today is our second anniversary.

652
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,610
Happy anniversary baby!

653
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,030
Let's go party.

654
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:55,360
-Let's go party.
-Harshita.

655
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,490
You should sleep.

656
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,030
You are drunk.

657
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,150
'I am in trouble.'

658
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,940
'I was not supposed
to tell this.'

659
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,570
Please get me the tin of sugar.

660
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,110
Carefully.

661
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,240
-How many times a week
does she drink? -Hey.

662
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,570
What do you mean by she drinks?

663
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,360
She is not a drunkard.

664
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,110
In our generation it is occasional.

665
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,070
Everybody drinks a little.

666
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,650
And I have no objection if she drinks.

667
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,320
Didn't father also used to drink?

668
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:53,650
He had taken a drink and gathered
courage and eloped with you.

669
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,190
Didn't father also used to drink?

670
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:00,780
Hey, after marriage
he hasn't even had a drop.

671
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,740
And he stopped smoking
also after a heart attack.

672
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,070
But it was not a heart attack.

673
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,190
I am going to sleep.
We will talk later.

674
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,610
Wait Sahil. Wait.

675
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,530
-Tell me.
-Where were you the whole night?

676
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,150
Mother I told you.

677
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,070
-At Rutvik's house.
-You too drink don't you?

678
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,490
Mother why are you stuck
on the same point?

679
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,490
Harshita and I do not
open a bottle every night.

680
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,740
It happens.
It is the culture of current times.

681
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:29,940
How was it in your times?

682
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,400
You used to go to a garden...

683
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,690
...and used to feel shy in front
of each other for no reason.

684
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,360
Mother all that has changed now.

685
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,190
Did you know about this?

686
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,990
I didn't now but I should know right?

687
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,650
The boy has grown up.

688
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,240
-Sahil.
-Yes.

689
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:48,570
In the future you won't even
touch alcohol. That's final.

690
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,650
Are you the mother from '70's films?

691
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,740
Are you going to place my hand on your
head and make me swear on your life?

692
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,780
She is being so dramatic.

693
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,650
Your father used to smoke heavily...

694
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,570
...and that is why
you had to wear glasses.

695
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:02,650
-Why are you raking up old issues...
-Don't interfere.

696
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,030
If one of the parents is addicted...

697
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,690
...it directly affects their children.

698
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,820
Addicted?

699
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,940
Is your mind working?
Do you have brains?

700
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,280
When you were young...

701
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,610
...you had eye glasses and
I used to follow you daily...

702
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,690
...with carrot juice so that
your eyes would not need the glasses.

703
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,940
And every night I
used to make you do...

704
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,570
...eye exercises before
you went to sleep.

705
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:25,900
-Do you remember?
-I do remember.

706
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,070
And I also remember that later
I used to have a splitting headache.

707
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,490
-Do you remember?
-Yes!

708
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:33,400
So didn't you remember
all that when you held...

709
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,900
...a glass of alcohol in your hand?

710
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,320
Mother, this is not my point at all?

711
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,320
Anyway you are not going
to understand my point.

712
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,490
-Forget it.
-Is that so?

713
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,440
Yes it is so.

714
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,070
Looking at you nobody can say...

715
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,150
...that you left the village
and came here 30 years ago.

716
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,740
You are still a fourth class
fail, uncivilized village woman.

717
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:03,740
Oh no.

718
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,610
Mother...

719
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,570
Sahil.

720
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,240
Oh no.

721
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:38,070
Despite being uncivilized
village woman...

722
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,900
...she has accepted
the concept of girlfriend.

723
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,820
And not only that...

724
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,530
...she has made Harshita
a part of our family.

725
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:58,860
She has asked or told about
every major or minor things...

726
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,690
...related to our family.

727
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:03,990
On every occasion she has said...

728
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,780
...that we must invite Harshita.

729
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,780
What she is saying right now...

730
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:18,530
...is for your and Harshita's health.

731
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,400
In fact...

732
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,610
...she has not misunderstood.

733
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,940
You have.

734
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,030
You are not able to understand her.

735
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:56,820
Shall we have tea?

736
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,990
-I will make it.
-No no... I will make it.

737
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:04,610
-Sahil.
-Yes?

738
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,740
-Go out and get some sugar.
-Okay.

739
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:27,690
I will go and get some sugar.

740
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:29,400
First say sorry.

741
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,150
Sorry.

742
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,110
Take 50 extra.

743
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,490
Buy a chocolate for yourself.

744
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,570
Are you okay or do you want to gargle?

745
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,320
I am okay.

746
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:24,820
Children. Children.

747
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:30,780
I have observed.

748
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,780
You laugh whenever I speak in English.

749
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:39,280
That is because you
look very beautiful.

750
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:42,150
Stop it.

751
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,650
The tea will get over boiled.

752
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,650
Where are you lost?

753
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:54,900
I used to understand Sahil
very well when he was young.

754
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:59,190
Even if he didn't tell
anything I would know...

755
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,570
...that the teachers
had scolded him that day...

756
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,530
...or that he had
a fight in the school.

757
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,940
But now I feel as if
I don't know this boy at all.

758
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,440
At first Sahil said
that Harshita is his friend.

759
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,610
Then he said that Harshita
is his special friend.

760
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,440
Then he said that Harshita is
this family's future daughter-in-law.

761
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,530
And now he says that
Harshita is nobody?

762
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,530
A man bought an entire bank...'

763
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:35,820
...and another Gujarati man
bought an entire vote bank.'

764
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:37,780
-No but seriously...'
-Take this.

765
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:39,240
...a smart watch worth Rs. 60,000...'

766
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,570
-'...and what do you do with it?'
-Okay.

767
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:42,440
-Here take this.
-Take.

768
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:44,900
-'Basically smart watch is just
like a boyfriend.' -Look here!

769
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,530
-Give me a chocolate.
-What?

770
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:49,030
'Are like a showpiece
and is never of use.'

771
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:54,990
No no. Sorry 
sorry... sometimes it is of use.'

772
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:58,400
'Smart watch. On top of it 
this species called boyfriend.'

773
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:11,320
Close...'

774
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,360
'It seems there is
nobody in the house.'

775
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:19,400
'What is the plan?'

776
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:24,490
The plan is to take our
love story further ahead.'

777
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:27,440
'But this is the first time.'

778
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:32,030
-'Okay. -So forgive me
if I make mistakes.'

779
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,690
'Rest you can do whatever you can.'

780
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:39,150
-'Okay.
-Come.'

781
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,610
'Let's go.'

782
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,030
This...'

783
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:52,780
'Wow.'

784
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,030
'How is it?'

785
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,570
'Amazing.'

786
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,860
-'Did you like it?
-Yes.'

787
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:11,530
So then...'

788
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:13,990
'let's chill on the bed'

789
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:19,610
'Okay. Josu and Mosu are
not home so Samosu is hot.'

790
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,940
'No no I mean it is not that.'

791
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:26,900
'I was just thinking about music.
Here is the remote.'

792
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:32,650
'Yes. Look 
let us dance since there is music.'

793
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:34,900
'What was it? That step?'

794
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:42,110
'What are you doing?'

795
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,240
-'It is a dance. Which step is it?
-Shall we change the music?'

796
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,570
'Okay?'

797
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:55,490
-'A bit...
-It is a bit soft isn't it?'

798
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:57,570
'Shall we create the mood?'

799
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:00,400
I never saw you coming.

800
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:03,240
Until you turned me around.

801
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,030
Used to think I was nothing.

802
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,990
Look at this love we found.

803
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,740
So give me your hand...

804
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,190
You can take mine.

805
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,990
No, I don't ever want to see you cry.

806
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,780
No more tears...

807
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,650
No more tears...

808
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,030
Take that chance.

809
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:22,440
We'll be fine.

810
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:25,320
No, I don't ever want to see you cry.

811
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,110
No more tears...

812
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:31,440
No more tears...

813
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:34,280
I never saw you coming.

814
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:37,150
Until you turned me around.

815
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,900
Used to think I was nothing.

816
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:43,400
Look at this love we found.

817
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:51,900
Are you missing her too much?

818
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:53,650
No.

819
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,110
Is there no chance?

820
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:59,690
No I mean I don't think so.

821
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:04,360
By now she must have told her parents.

822
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,690
I don't think so.

823
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:11,240
Had it been so, your father-in-law
would have called up by now.

824
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:14,030
Sorry, your ex-father-in-law.

825
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:19,320
Since he is ex now 
shall I ask you something?

826
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,280
What?

827
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,820
Does he seem to be too enthusiastic
to me or is he really like that?

828
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:25,990
-He is...
-He is?

829
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,320
I always tell Harshita that
your father is very enthu-cutlet.

830
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,440
-Enthu-cutlet.
-Enthu-cutlet?

831
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:36,070
When we place a cutlet
on stove it goes...

832
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,280
Enthu-cutlet.

833
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:49,070
Look if I talk about myself,
your mother and I have fought a lot.

834
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:52,490
Fight? I remember only one fight.

835
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,070
Mother took me to my
maternal uncle's house for 10 days...

836
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:59,780
...and checked out
a new school for me and...

837
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:02,860
-What was it exactly?
-A typical thing.

838
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:05,650
We used to stay in a rented house.

839
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:09,360
It was Diwali time and
we were financially constrained.

840
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:13,240
At that time we didn't
own four spectacles shops.

841
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:16,650
I used to go from town
to town carrying sample pieces.

842
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:19,740
It was Diwali time so the neighbours...

843
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,440
...used to send something
or the other to our house.

844
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:22,860
Sometimes dry fruits...

845
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:23,780
...sometimes 'Badam Puri'
(sweet dish made with almonds).

846
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:25,070
Yes 'Badam Puri'.

847
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,990
I used to relish it.

848
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:28,990
Your mother also thought...

849
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:30,780
...that we too should
send 'Cholafali'...

850
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,030
...and 'ghughra' (salted snack
and sweet stuffed dumplings).

851
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:37,940
Well in those days we didn't
even have utensils to fry them.

852
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:42,440
Your mother wanted new utensils
and you wanted crackers.

853
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:44,490
Every night when I returned home...

854
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:46,860
...you would ask only one question.

855
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,240
Father, when will
we go to buy crackers?

856
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,440
I deliberately use to return late...

857
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:54,740
...so that I wouldn't
have to answer you.

858
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:58,070
Very soon the night of Diwali arrived.

859
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,990
But I couldn't manage to get money.

860
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:02,570
Next?

861
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:06,690
I didn't have the courage
to come home...

862
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:12,280
...so I went and sat
with your uncle Tribhuvan.

863
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:16,320
When I came home you were asleep...

864
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:18,740
...but your mother again
asked the same question.

865
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:19,860
Utensils?

866
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:24,740
I was a bit drunk.

867
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:25,990
Yes.

868
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:29,860
So I banged all the
utensils in the house...

869
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,610
...and I abused her in a raised voice.

870
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:34,190
At that time she didn't say anything.

871
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:35,940
She went to sleep without a word.

872
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,110
But when I woke up in
the morning I found out...

873
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,530
...that she had gone to her
brother's house along with you.

874
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:46,190
I got angry and went
to her brother's house.

875
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,070
I don't need her.

876
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:54,900
After a few days I felt very
lonely on seeing the empty house.

877
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,490
I wrote her a letter.

878
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,030
Come back home.

879
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:04,650
She refused and said that
she will tolerate everything...

880
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:07,610
...but not my raised voice.

881
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,900
Then somehow I brought
both of you back home.

882
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,110
Son what I mean to say...

883
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:19,650
...is that ever after
all this happened...

884
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,740
...the three of us are together.

885
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,150
Happily ever after.

886
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,610
But there still remained regret
in this happily ever after life.

887
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:32,570
Regarding what?

888
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:35,780
-I and your mother had eloped
and got married. -Yes.

889
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:38,150
So I didn't have a wedding procession.

890
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,240
And I like wedding
processions very much.

891
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,400
So I was going to fulfil
my unfulfilled wish...

892
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:45,610
...by dancing in your
wedding procession.

893
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:47,570
Oh I see.

894
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,110
But now you are divorced.

895
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:54,690
Father why mother and you
Keep calling it divorce?

896
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,990
Between divorce and breakup...

897
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,280
-There is a very big difference.
-Yes.

898
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:01,610
-I remember. Yes.
-Yes.

899
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,110
He is talking nonsense.

900
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:08,280
Hey get ready.
We have to go for lunch.

901
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,190
No I don't want to go for lunch.

902
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,780
Why? Will Hasu be there?

903
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,320
Yes.

904
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:16,240
Hasu will be there and both of us...

905
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,780
...are going to have
a nice candlelight lunch.

906
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,740
-Do come.
-Stop it.

907
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,030
He won't come right?

908
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:33,690
Why should I be a spoilsport?

909
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,650
Take mother on date.

910
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,240
Today is special.

911
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:41,030
Rubbish.

912
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,240
He doesn't even remember
that today is special.

913
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,530
He hasn't even wished me.

914
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:48,570
But I have.

915
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:50,900
Would someone wake me up
from sleep and wish in this manner?

916
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,030
I almost had a heart attack.

917
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:54,740
Can you come here?

918
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:58,690
This...

919
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:02,240
I suggest we should try
to explain to the children...

920
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:04,900
...that there is
nothing like a breakup.

921
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:09,240
Stop fighting and
think about Gandhiji.

922
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:13,190
On this day it will be as you say.

923
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,190
Yes mother.

924
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,650
Give a suggestion about
where to go for lunch.

925
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:25,780
Mother go anywhere.

926
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,490
Gujarati lunch platter
is the same everywhere.

927
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:30,150
No I don't want to
eat Gujarati lunch platter.

928
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,610
Today I feel like eating
something fine and tasty.

929
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:36,990
This time?

930
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:40,240
Oh God.

931
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,780
There is a nice
restaurant near Bodakdev.

932
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,440
I Love Sandwich House. Go there.

933
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:54,240
Sandwich? Oh no.

934
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:57,400
Are you going to feed
bread to your mother?

935
00:55:58,780 --> 00:55:59,940
Didn't I tell you?

936
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,110
Fine! Tasty food is not in my fate.

937
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:05,030
After ages, I
had got in the mood.

938
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:05,900
-What is this?
-But...

939
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:07,400
Mother. Mother. Mother.

940
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:12,280
You see there you get nice
and various kinds of sandwiches...

941
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:14,990
Wait! I will come along.

942
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,070
Yes.

943
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,190
Come.

944
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:33,530
-Let us go.
-Are you coming like this only?

945
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,360
Atleast wear full pants.

946
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:38,570
Do one thing. I will Whatsapp you
what to order okay?

947
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:39,780
-You can order it.
-No... no... no... no!

948
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,320
Don't go.

949
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:42,780
Why do you act like this?

950
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,030
Yes. Here take this.

951
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:46,860
What?

952
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,860
Today you are going to drive it.

953
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:51,400
No no... I won't drive it.
I feel very scared.

954
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:54,400
No no... we decided that
you are going to ride it on Sunday.

955
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:56,030
But I don't want to ride it.

956
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,780
And didn't you tell me
that today it will be as I wish?

957
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:01,280
No this is not part of that.

958
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,240
-No.
-Take this.

959
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,190
-Hey don't do this.
-Come on. I am hungry let us go.

960
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,940
But I am feeling scared.
What if we meet with an accident?

961
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:08,860
-Come on.
-What if something happens to our son?

962
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:11,150
He is not even married as yet.

963
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,570
Mother nothing will happen. Come on.

964
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:16,990
-No. -Either you drive
or else I will go back.

965
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,190
You should not emotionally
blackmail your mother.

966
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,400
Okay. Sit.

967
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:22,190
-Take this.
-Yes. Come.

968
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,240
First class.

969
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,280
Okay.

970
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:28,490
-Very good Josu very good.
-Mother, why are you taking this route?

971
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:29,610
Go by the main road.

972
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,940
No, not the main road. I feel scared.

973
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,860
And so far your father has
taught me to ride in lanes only.

974
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:38,150
Okay. Take a right turn further on.

975
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:43,440
Mother I am telling you
to take a right turn.

976
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:44,860
Why are you going to the left?

977
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:50,240
Hey by mistake we
have entered Hasu's lane.

978
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,650
-Mother. Take U turn immediately.
-Yes?

979
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:57,320
You are getting scared as if
we will come face to face with Hasu.

980
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,990
-Right!
-What?

981
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:00,650
Hey look there she is.

982
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,900
-Oh yes. She is Harshita!
-Mother let's us go back. Mother!

983
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:05,780
-Shall we make her sit with us?
-Come on let us meet her.

984
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,570
Oh no. It is not her.

985
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,570
Mother take a U turn immediately...

986
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:45,940
-...or else I will jump.
-But...

987
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:47,190
Hey you...

988
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:50,650
Hey.

989
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:53,570
Mother. Mother 
why are you going this way?

990
00:59:55,150 --> 00:59:56,360
Let me get down.

991
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,570
Great...

992
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,610
Wasn't this your plan?
Wasn't this your plan?

993
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:03,150
I was wondering that
someone who loves to eat...

994
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,150
...garlic potatoes roasted
brinjal and curry and lentil-rice...

995
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,400
...why does she want
to eat different today?

996
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:08,820
Right?

997
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,610
It was my fault because
I got deceived by your words.

998
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:12,690
I am leaving.

999
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,610
Hello.

1000
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,190
Yes.

1001
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:22,570
No I mean...

1002
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:24,610
Downstairs...

1003
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,610
Yes okay.

1004
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:31,650
Congratulations.
Congratulations. Congratulations.

1005
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,400
Your plan has been successful.

1006
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:34,780
Harshita is coming downstairs.

1007
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:07,080
-Hey! Round and round!
-Both have gone crazy.

1008
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:10,040
Sahil you too come.

1009
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:13,240
-Son!
-Are you enjoying or not?

1010
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:16,620
Look here! Look here!

1011
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,830
Sahil come. What is this?

1012
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:24,330
Son! You too go and sit behind father.

1013
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,330
-What is it?
-Uncle give me your mobile.

1014
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:29,830
-Why?
-I want to play a game.

1015
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:30,790
Are you enjoying?

1016
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:32,580
I have landed in a mess here.

1017
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:34,990
Look here! Look here!

1018
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,160
-Do you have a girlfriend?
-No.

1019
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,660
Very good! Don't ever have one also.

1020
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:39,830
She will give you a headache!

1021
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:41,200
-Go!
-Children!

1022
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:42,580
Who wants to eat chocolates?

1023
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:43,990
-Come here.
-Aunty I want to eat.

1024
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,290
-Aunty me first.
-Chocolates!

1025
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:47,120
-Aunty me first!
-Aunty I want!

1026
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:48,580
-Take this!
-Aunty! Yeah!

1027
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,080
-Yeah! Yeah aunty.
-For you.

1028
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:51,910
Aunty I want one!

1029
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:53,080
-Give me a kiss.
-Yes!

1030
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,410
Yeah! Yeah!

1031
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:58,830
-Yeah!
-Give me also a chocolate...

1032
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:00,410
...so even I will give you a kiss.

1033
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,660
-You are also...
-But...

1034
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,080
Give me.

1035
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:07,330
'I am getting irritated
seeing so much love.'

1036
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,120
'I hate her?'

1037
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:22,620
'Yes! I hate her!'

1038
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:27,370
Sister! Sister!
Your in-laws gave us chocolates.

1039
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,490
-Yes!
-Oh yes.

1040
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:36,330
That's okay!

1041
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,830
-Please come up.
-No, some other time.

1042
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,370
Right now we have come to take you.

1043
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:43,450
We have made a plan of
trying different sandwiches today.

1044
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:44,450
Yes!

1045
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:45,990
Son which was that place?

1046
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:48,290
-I Love Sandwich...
-I Love Sandwich House.

1047
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:49,620
-Yes!
-Yes!

1048
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:53,290
But mother has already prepared lunch.

1049
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:55,290
-That...
-Let that be...

1050
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:57,870
Like my pancake batter!

1051
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:01,080
-Let's go my dear.
-She is too much!

1052
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:03,870
But I will have to
ask my parents so...

1053
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:04,540
-Wait!
-Hey...

1054
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:06,290
-I will only speak to Sadhnaben.
-Yes.

1055
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:13,160
-Hello!
-How are you Jyotsnaben?

1056
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,290
-Yes Sadhnaben!
-Tell me.

1057
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:16,990
I don't wish to speak to you!

1058
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,120
Why? What happened?

1059
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:21,700
The other day we decided to meet
at the temple but you never came.

1060
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:24,120
-Listen we have to take her with us.
-Actually what happened was...

1061
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,450
...I was ready to leave...

1062
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,620
...but Harshita's father
had an upset stomach.

1063
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:29,160
Oh God! He had an upset stomach?

1064
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:30,950
-You...
-Do this you give him pomegranate...

1065
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,950
Sadhnaben,
actually we were out to have lunch...

1066
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,330
...so can we take Harshita with us?

1067
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:38,160
Mohanbhai, why do you need to ask?

1068
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:39,740
She is your daughter.

1069
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,660
-Okay thank you.
-Bye.

1070
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:43,580
-Permission granted.
-Great!

1071
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:45,540
-I will get ready and come.
-Yes.

1072
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:47,120
One minute!
One minute! Wait my child.

1073
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:50,540
Here take this chocolate.

1074
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:55,700
-Sahil!
-Yes!

1075
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:59,080
Listen! You go and meet
Jayeshbhai and Sadhnaben.

1076
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,330
It won't look good.

1077
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:02,330
One minute, come here.

1078
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,370
What will I do going up there?

1079
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:05,580
-Should I go and placate them?
-But...

1080
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:07,290
-But... -Should I do
the planning of my marriage?

1081
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:10,240
At times you really become too sweet.

1082
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:13,910
Hey look! I am always sweet.

1083
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:15,870
You go now.

1084
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:18,290
-Give me a chocolate!
-It's over.

1085
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:24,290
Just look at him.
He kept it in his pocket.

1086
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:44,950
Lift... lift... lift... wait!

1087
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:48,700
You would have died.

1088
01:04:57,790 --> 01:04:59,490
You should have walked
up the stairs instead.

1089
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,080
Hey what are you doing?

1090
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:08,240
Sister, uncle was saying
that you trouble him a lot.

1091
01:05:08,330 --> 01:05:10,490
-Bye uncle!
-How cheap you can be!

1092
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:13,080
I told him about
girlfriends in general.

1093
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:15,160
Why did you bring them here?

1094
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:16,580
I did not bring them.

1095
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:18,950
No sooner than they came to know,
they brought me here.

1096
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:20,370
You already told them?

1097
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:21,990
Didn't you tell them?

1098
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,870
I am not immature like you.

1099
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:31,870
Are you all going up?

1100
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:33,370
We are going to Mother
Goddess's temple.

1101
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:34,950
I see.

1102
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,040
He is asking us are you going up...

1103
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:41,290
Are you waiting for
an auspicious time to say?

1104
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:43,870
I am definitely not going
to advertise on Facebook.

1105
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:46,370
Did you receive calls from everyone?
Did you get sympathy?

1106
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:48,660
What do you think? Have I
done all this for getting sympathy?

1107
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:50,540
-Obviously!
-Don't insult me!

1108
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,950
What else should I do?
Should I praise you?

1109
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:58,660
-Welcome son! Welcome!
-Please come...

1110
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,200
Your hair has grown a lot...

1111
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:05,120
What are you doing?
You will damage his hair.

1112
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:09,740
What are you doing?

1113
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:12,740
Don't seek my blessings.
I am only four years elder to you.

1114
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:19,290
Come in I will show you
something interesting. Come.

1115
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:26,700
Son the wedding planner has
sent various styles for your wedding.

1116
01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:27,910
I will show you.

1117
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:33,370
Yes! First style! Jodha Akbar!

1118
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:37,080
Everything in Mughlai style
right from food to the decoration.

1119
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:40,990
-So do you know how
will you take an entry? -How?

1120
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:43,540
Riding on an elephant!

1121
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:46,160
That means you will enter swaying...

1122
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,580
...and from behind
the song will be played...

1123
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:52,200
The great emperor is arriving.

1124
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:57,450
We will always salute him!

1125
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:00,040
Surround system!

1126
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:03,200
Dolby Digital!

1127
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:05,080
You didn't like it?

1128
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:09,790
Don't worry.
He has sent another style as well.

1129
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:11,330
Yes! This one!

1130
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:18,580
You like a Greek God and my daughter 
Harshita...

1131
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,290
-...like a Greek Goddess!
-Yes!

1132
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:24,450
Both of you will come walking
and all around there will be...

1133
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:28,490
...huge broken boulders
and Roman pillars.

1134
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:30,620
And at the back...

1135
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,410
It's over!

1136
01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:51,450
One minute!

1137
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:53,490
There is also a third style 
my favorite!

1138
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:55,080
-Oh my...
-See this!

1139
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,160
Avenger's style!

1140
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:03,200
You like an Iron Man and my daughter,
Wonder Woman!

1141
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,490
I know there is no
Wonder Woman in Avengers...

1142
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:08,870
...but the thing is I have added
that as it is my favorite character.

1143
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:11,620
You will be wearing iron
clothes and will be seated...

1144
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,910
...in a rocket and you will
directly land in the wedding dais.

1145
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:16,290
And as soon as you enter,
all around you will be...

1146
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:19,540
...Hulk, Black Panther and that...

1147
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,120
What?

1148
01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:24,790
-Spider Man!
-Yes!

1149
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:26,790
-All this because
children love them. -Yes.

1150
01:08:27,290 --> 01:08:28,290
-Sahil!
-Yes!

1151
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:31,040
-Please come in for a minute!
-Right away!

1152
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,410
-And son listen!
-Yes!

1153
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:35,910
If you did not like this style
there is a fourth style as well.

1154
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:37,120
Japanese style!

1155
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,660
And listen! First time in Ahmedabad...

1156
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:41,990
...we will keep Momo counters!

1157
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:46,120
Hey, explain to your father that Momos
are from Nepal and not from Japan!

1158
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,330
Good for nothing!

1159
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:50,410
Even I know how to abuse parents.

1160
01:08:50,490 --> 01:08:51,790
But I don't wish to do that.
They are standing downstairs.

1161
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:53,080
Tell me what is it now? Hurry up.

1162
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:56,490
What should I wear for your parents?

1163
01:08:56,990 --> 01:08:57,910
Wear whatever you like!

1164
01:08:57,990 --> 01:09:00,620
No matter what you wear
you will never look beautiful.

1165
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:02,410
You leave!

1166
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:03,740
-No the way you are asking
on Facebook... -Just...

1167
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:05,040
-...what should I wear?
-just get out of my room!

1168
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:05,910
What should I wear?

1169
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:07,370
-And all that nonsense!
-Get out of my room!

1170
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:12,370
I hope we are not exaggerating?

1171
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:16,540
We still do not know the
real reason for their breakup.

1172
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:21,240
But do you think Harshita
will speak to us freely?

1173
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,410
That is what we have to see.

1174
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:28,040
They have come. They have come.

1175
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,540
She is looking so beautiful isn't it?

1176
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,200
Yes. And your son looks like a monkey.

1177
01:09:34,410 --> 01:09:35,660
Hey what is this?

1178
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,290
From so long you've been
saying your son, your son?

1179
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:40,120
Is he not your son also?

1180
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:42,990
Has he directly landed
in my lap from the sky?

1181
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:45,040
-Come children!
-Come come.

1182
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:47,160
-Son you ride.
-Come.

1183
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:48,910
You come here. So I am free.

1184
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:51,790
-Father! You ride peacefully.
-Okay.

1185
01:09:57,410 --> 01:09:59,490
Here wear this cap. It is very hot.

1186
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:00,540
Yes.

1187
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,040
Take this.

1188
01:10:03,330 --> 01:10:04,330
Great!

1189
01:10:05,790 --> 01:10:07,660
Wear it without creating a scene.

1190
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:22,290
-Hey balloons balloons!
-Balloons! Balloons! Yes!

1191
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:23,540
-Give me!
-Sister take this.

1192
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:27,080
-Here... thank you!
-Balloons! Balloons!

1193
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:30,120
Red balloons!
Anyone wishes to buy! Yes tell me.

1194
01:10:30,370 --> 01:10:32,740
Yes. Yes. Take this.

1195
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:43,740
-Please come!
-Oh! It's a lovely place!

1196
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:46,620
They are playing games
on every table here.

1197
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:47,830
-Hello sir!
-Hello.

1198
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,620
-I will get menu card.
-Thank you.

1199
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:56,740
Nice! Good place!

1200
01:10:56,830 --> 01:10:59,540
Thank you to you too because...

1201
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:02,660
It is because of you both
that we get to see new places...

1202
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:06,990
...otherwise she only feeds me Egg
plant bread lentil rice and curry.

1203
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:08,580
And when you get all
this together it becomes...

1204
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,450
...a complete Gujarati meal. Right?

1205
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:14,950
But what is wrong in a Gujarati meal?

1206
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:19,330
Harshita you tell me.
There is variety as well as home made.

1207
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:21,330
Mother you must
eat at home only then.

1208
01:11:22,490 --> 01:11:23,950
Why do people go out?

1209
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:25,950
To try something new isn't it?

1210
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,370
-Right!
-Yes.

1211
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:29,120
You know me.

1212
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,410
I always love trying something new.

1213
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:35,160
There is always a fight between
me and your mother on this.

1214
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,830
Do they know about our first fight?

1215
01:11:40,490 --> 01:11:43,580
-Yes! It was a solid story.
-Yes.

1216
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:46,830
On our wedding reception...

1217
01:11:47,290 --> 01:11:50,120
...I mean we eloped
and got married.

1218
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,290
We then had a grand reception.

1219
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:53,540
-Harshita!
-Yes!

1220
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:54,790
-This is worth hearing.
-Okay.

1221
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:56,410
So, on our wedding reception...

1222
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:57,910
This was in 1991!

1223
01:11:58,370 --> 01:12:00,490
Your grandfather
had arranged a dinner...

1224
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,200
...that was 175 rupees per plate!

1225
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:04,370
Everything was included in that.

1226
01:12:04,450 --> 01:12:07,240
South Indian,
Punjabi... Gujarati... and Chinese!

1227
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:10,290
At that time what is that...

1228
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:12,040
...fried rice and Manchurian...

1229
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,290
...were just launched in India.

1230
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:20,790
From morning I was waiting eagerly
to eat fried rice and Manchurian.

1231
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:24,490
Now whose reception it is...

1232
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:29,370
...I mean the couple
like you both are...

1233
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:34,540
I mean like we both are.

1234
01:12:34,990 --> 01:12:37,290
-We are supposed to eat in one plate.
-Yes.

1235
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:41,200
-Now I wanted to eat...
-Fried rice. Okay then?

1236
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:44,160
Yes. And your mother wanted
to eat lentil and rice.

1237
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:46,200
We started fighting.

1238
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:50,870
Since then till today fighting
over food but together in life.

1239
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:55,790
Why are we discussing this now?

1240
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,290
What do you mean why?

1241
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:01,870
When we all sit together
it is fun to remember old memories.

1242
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:03,740
-Is that so?
-Okay.

1243
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:04,990
Forget about us.

1244
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:10,370
-What do you both fight about?
-I knew it!

1245
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:16,700
I very well knew the way you
were talking where it was leading to.

1246
01:13:17,950 --> 01:13:20,660
By the way Harshita is aware...

1247
01:13:21,870 --> 01:13:24,870
...that you already know
that we had a breakup.

1248
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:34,410
No my child it is not that...

1249
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:39,410
Aunty sorry but even
I will feel awkward.

1250
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:41,660
It's better that
we don't discuss this...

1251
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:44,700
Sir!

1252
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:46,790
Yes!

1253
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:50,910
-Mojito!
-Sir it is Mojito.

1254
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:54,790
But in the menu card
it is written as Mojito.

1255
01:13:55,410 --> 01:13:58,370
Such a famous hotel
and printing like this...

1256
01:13:58,450 --> 01:14:00,080
Sir even I am a Gujarati.

1257
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:02,040
-Is that so?
-Yes!

1258
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:04,620
Take this away! Okay.

1259
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,040
See how he pronounces Mojito.

1260
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:10,200
Mojito is a Spanish drink.

1261
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:11,740
In Spanish 'J' is pronounced as 'H'.

1262
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,410
Is that so?
How do they pronounce 'H' then?

1263
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:19,290
Hey cheating cheating.
You are doing cheating.

1264
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:22,700
Come we will also play some games.

1265
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:23,870
-Yes.
-You won't know how to play.

1266
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:26,200
What games and all that?
Have you come here to play games?

1267
01:14:26,330 --> 01:14:28,830
-But...
-Oh no! He just ruins our mood.

1268
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,410
-Jenga!
-We can play Jenga!

1269
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,160
Yes! See Jenga!

1270
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:37,540
-Hey Josu!
-Yes!

1271
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:38,830
What is Jenga?

1272
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:47,660
Thank God! I am saved!

1273
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:50,040
Now I understood!

1274
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:52,950
You must make it like
a card mansion and not break it.

1275
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:55,330
And the one who breaks it he gets...

1276
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,120
Punishment!

1277
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:01,160
-Here take this!
-Yes!

1278
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:05,160
Reveal a secret about
somebody on this table.

1279
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:07,040
Aunty that means you
will have to tell a secret...

1280
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,290
...about anyone of us.

1281
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:09,700
Okay like that!

1282
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:15,700
Samosu... ( Stuffed dumpling)

1283
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,240
I didn't want to play.

1284
01:15:17,330 --> 01:15:18,990
Why did I start playing all this?

1285
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,870
-Hey!
-No no... you don't have any option!

1286
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:23,120
Your mother wishes to speak.

1287
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:24,910
-Mother!
-Yes!

1288
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,660
-Don't tell about that.
-What? Which matter?

1289
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:29,080
-Mother...
-That one!

1290
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,540
-Oh yes! Tell it!
-Father you also!

1291
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:32,660
-It cannot be told here.
-What is it?

1292
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:33,950
-Wait wait!
-What is it?

1293
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:35,620
It is nothing.
There is nothing like that!

1294
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:36,950
-Son!
-There is nothing like that!

1295
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,700
One minute! I wish to hear.

1296
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:39,950
-Yes you tell her. Tell her.
-Come on tell me.

1297
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,240
When Sahil was small...

1298
01:15:41,290 --> 01:15:42,120
-Mother quiet!
-At that time..

1299
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:43,160
You keep quiet.

1300
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:46,080
When I would not allow
him to go to down to play...

1301
01:15:46,490 --> 01:15:48,910
...he would undress himself
and run around the entire house.

1302
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:51,450
Strike! Strike! Strike!

1303
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:52,870
Strike!

1304
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:56,620
You never told me this?

1305
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:59,370
Is this anything to talk about?

1306
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:00,450
-But you should have told me.
-Just see it is working.

1307
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:01,660
-Do we have to talk on this topic?
-It is working.

1308
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:15,080
Say one good thing about
the person to your right.

1309
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:20,080
Yes! That means Harshita should
say something good about Sahil.

1310
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:22,080
-Okay!
-This should be worth hearing.

1311
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:25,040
She might not have anything
good to say about me.

1312
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:26,330
Let's move ahead. Come on.

1313
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:27,910
Sit quietly now.

1314
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:30,040
-Yes my dear tell us. Tell us.
-Yes.

1315
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:37,700
Sahil...

1316
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:41,540
...is very supportive.

1317
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,830
Good. Thank you.

1318
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:45,160
Let's move ahead now. Come on.

1319
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:46,950
Hey you don't...

1320
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:48,790
You speak.

1321
01:16:51,290 --> 01:16:55,580
What I am in my career today
is all because of Sahil's support.

1322
01:16:57,830 --> 01:16:58,910
Thank you!

1323
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:08,580
London bridge is falling down,
falling down.

1324
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:10,490
-"London bridge is falling down...'
-Father no...

1325
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:13,040
-"Falling down... it fell down!"
-Oh no!

1326
01:17:15,370 --> 01:17:16,490
What is it?

1327
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:24,790
Confess one thing about
the person on your left.

1328
01:17:25,490 --> 01:17:26,910
I never wanted to sit here.
I unnecessarily...

1329
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:28,830
-No no! No excuses now.
-Look...

1330
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,200
Just confess.

1331
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:31,540
Confession means...

1332
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:33,080
-What is in your heart... I understood.
-Yes.

1333
01:17:35,330 --> 01:17:36,740
Harshita...

1334
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:41,240
Harshita is a nice girl.

1335
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:44,040
That means nice in what way?

1336
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:45,990
I mean...

1337
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,160
In all respects.

1338
01:17:54,330 --> 01:17:55,740
What do you wish to say?

1339
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:57,870
He is lying.

1340
01:17:58,490 --> 01:17:59,660
He does not feel so.

1341
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:03,830
No Harshita I am not lying.

1342
01:18:04,990 --> 01:18:11,450
Leave aside our breakup
but what I said just now is...

1343
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:17,160
That's it!
I just wanted to say this much.

1344
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:28,540
-Look at this!
-Oh no!

1345
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:34,660
Yes. Gift something to
the person sitting opposite you!

1346
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:38,200
Wow! Gift! Come on give me.

1347
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:45,870
Uncle!

1348
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,330
No no! This is not for the game.

1349
01:18:49,290 --> 01:18:51,910
We already brought
this gift for you.

1350
01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:54,120
This is for your first
show that was houseful.

1351
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:56,160
-Yes. Take it my child. Take it.
-Take it.

1352
01:18:56,790 --> 01:18:58,160
-Accept it.
-Yes.

1353
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:05,370
Uncle no!
I cannot accept this. Please!

1354
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:08,370
Hey this is... this is nothing!

1355
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:11,990
I have arranged a success
party for you on Saturday night.

1356
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,950
Invite all your comedy friends.

1357
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:16,330
Tell them there is
a cocktail party to follow.

1358
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:18,290
All branded stuff!

1359
01:19:18,370 --> 01:19:21,620
Your uncle Tribhuvan will
arrange for all the bottles.

1360
01:19:23,790 --> 01:19:26,790
Uncle cocktail?

1361
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:29,160
But I don't...

1362
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:32,330
-Sahil told us that
you do take at times. -Yes.

1363
01:19:41,870 --> 01:19:42,870
One minute!

1364
01:19:46,290 --> 01:19:47,450
Water!

1365
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:49,290
I said that by mistake.
Harshita one minute!

1366
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:50,740
By mistake you must
have also told them...

1367
01:19:50,830 --> 01:19:53,040
...that I was not a
virgin before I met you.

1368
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,950
I had many boyfriends before you.

1369
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:57,540
And I am also sure that by
mistake you must have told them...

1370
01:19:57,620 --> 01:19:59,740
...that Harshita is
such a characterless girl.

1371
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:01,580
I never said anything like that!

1372
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:03,330
By mistake even I can
say something about you...

1373
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:05,620
...as to how you got addicted
to betting due to which...

1374
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:07,870
...you had incurred
a debt of four lakhs.

1375
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:09,990
And you took money from me so that...

1376
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,870
...they do not come to your
house to recover that money.

1377
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:13,830
And you must have
definitely told them that...

1378
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:16,540
...you did not leave the coaching
classes but you were thrown out.

1379
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:17,870
It is nothing like that...

1380
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:19,580
I never wanted to do that job.

1381
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:21,120
Why didn't you want to do that job?

1382
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:22,450
Hey...

1383
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:25,790
I had other plans!

1384
01:20:25,910 --> 01:20:27,700
I have been hearing this
since the past six months.

1385
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:29,290
What are your plans?

1386
01:20:29,330 --> 01:20:30,790
Are you going on Mars?

1387
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:32,200
Harshita come with me.
Harshita wait a minute.

1388
01:20:32,330 --> 01:20:33,790
Harshita lets order food.

1389
01:20:33,910 --> 01:20:35,290
-Mother... father...
-I don't want to eat. Okay?

1390
01:20:35,370 --> 01:20:36,200
Harshita!

1391
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:37,240
-Leave my hand!
-Harshita one...

1392
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,470
I found it very strange!

1393
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:06,470
She left without even informing us?

1394
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,630
Mother! Father!

1395
01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:11,220
Let's go.

1396
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:14,970
My child till date you
have taken all your decisions.

1397
01:21:16,550 --> 01:21:19,220
And I wish that you
only decide about this now.

1398
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:48,970
What is this?

1399
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:57,050
The proof of my moving on.

1400
01:21:57,550 --> 01:21:58,590
Move on?

1401
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:01,630
Since morning such difficult
words are making me...

1402
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:04,300
Sahil say something
that we can understand.

1403
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:07,930
When you move ahead in life
leaving behind your old relations...

1404
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:10,010
...that is called as moving on.

1405
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:14,680
I have decided that I do
not wish to fall in love anymore.

1406
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:17,550
That's my biodata.

1407
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:21,930
I am now ready for
an arranged marriage.

1408
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:24,340
Sahil Sutaria. Age 26.

1409
01:22:24,430 --> 01:22:29,180
Educational qualification 
MBA gold medalist from IM Ahmedabad.

1410
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:33,260
Mother no sooner they read this
much you will start getting calls...

1411
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:36,510
...with a wedding proposal.

1412
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:39,880
-What happened?
-No no!

1413
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:41,720
In an arranged marriage...

1414
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,760
...you also need a job with
your educational qualification.

1415
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:46,630
The profession column
that is below...

1416
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:49,220
...the educational qualification
column is blank.

1417
01:22:50,010 --> 01:22:51,550
What shall we write in that?

1418
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:55,430
We will write in that...

1419
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:56,970
That...

1420
01:22:57,050 --> 01:22:58,840
Professor of accounts.

1421
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:02,510
But you have left that job.

1422
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:07,510
Those people are giving me
a better offer so I will take it.

1423
01:23:10,010 --> 01:23:11,800
MBA gold medalist!

1424
01:23:12,430 --> 01:23:14,260
-Accounts professor.
-So what?

1425
01:23:14,630 --> 01:23:16,760
What's wrong in being a professor?

1426
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:21,840
No my son! No job is bad
that is if you do it diligently.

1427
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:26,130
There is a column for income
under the profession column.

1428
01:23:27,090 --> 01:23:33,300
Like Harshita other girls
won't let go in such cases isn't it?

1429
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:36,470
There is no need of a biodata then.

1430
01:23:38,970 --> 01:23:42,180
Mother, your friend... who is that one...

1431
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:43,510
...who stays in Surendra Nagar?

1432
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,880
-Pravina!
-Yes Pravina! Pravina!

1433
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:48,380
Her daughter is still not married 
isn't it?

1434
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,720
Call and tell her that
I am ready to meet her.

1435
01:23:51,430 --> 01:23:53,260
You call if you wish to meet her.

1436
01:23:54,470 --> 01:23:55,590
Mother will not call.

1437
01:23:56,510 --> 01:23:59,680
Mother whatsapp me the number
I will speak to her my way.

1438
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,590
-Listen!
-Yes?

1439
01:24:02,130 --> 01:24:04,380
Call Harshita's parents as well.

1440
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:07,180
Tell them that you
have decided to move on.

1441
01:24:08,430 --> 01:24:10,630
They too might want
to make Harshita's biodata...

1442
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:12,800
-Enough father!
-Enough of you fooling yourself.

1443
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:17,760
Give yourself proof
of moving on. Not us.

1444
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:23,010
Sahil! Sahil!

1445
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:27,090
Don't provoke him at such times.

1446
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:28,720
What if he does something untoward?

1447
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:31,300
The problem is that
he does not do anything.

1448
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:36,010
Kinjal! How are you? Fine?

1449
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:37,720
Where are you now?

1450
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:40,930
Okay Goa? Great! Family? Family?

1451
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:42,880
Okay boyfriend...

1452
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:45,840
Aarohi! What are your dinner plans?

1453
01:24:46,090 --> 01:24:47,260
Don't do that then!

1454
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:50,010
We will go on my bike and have eggs.

1455
01:24:50,470 --> 01:24:51,470
Okay you are fasting today.

1456
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:54,430
Hi Eshadi!
What are your plans? Which way?

1457
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:58,050
If you don't have any plans
then let's go to Gandhinagar tonight.

1458
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:01,720
We will have dinner at the
Dhaba and listen to old songs.

1459
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:05,090
I don't care a damn
if Harshita has any problem.

1460
01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:07,010
We had a breakup.

1461
01:25:08,430 --> 01:25:09,970
Okay so you are in London.

1462
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:14,220
Hey, no no... Deeksha 
what are you talking about rebound?

1463
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:15,720
Are you out of your mind?

1464
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:19,090
Actually this was going
on for a long time so I told you...

1465
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:22,050
Oh no! Okay then.

1466
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:24,840
I will call you again later.

1467
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:28,550
Hero, what happened?'

1468
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,180
'Is no one giving you any importance?'

1469
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:32,220
'No one wishes to meet you?'

1470
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:34,800
'Try calling Vyoma.'

1471
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:37,090
'I will also try calling Parineeti.'

1472
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:39,630
'But henceforth I will
never call you to meet me.'

1473
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:43,630
-'Trying to act smart.
-My Samosu is angry?'

1474
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,930
-'Won’t I be angry?’
-You meet once in ten years.'

1475
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:48,880
Forget about me but that
gym instructor was also telling me.'

1476
01:25:48,930 --> 01:25:50,760
'Is madam interested
in building her body or not?'

1477
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:53,130
'What are you saying?
This is not right.'

1478
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:56,970
'Come I will set your mood right.'

1479
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:02,800
'Day after tomorrow
is my first public show.'

1480
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:05,930
'No sooner the booking started
in two hours it was housefull.'

1481
01:26:06,050 --> 01:26:08,720
-'Housefull means?
-I have kept tickets for you.'

1482
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:12,760
'Okay. I am honored okay. I am honored
that you have kept a ticket for me.'

1483
01:26:13,050 --> 01:26:16,130
I will see your first
and last public show live...'

1484
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:19,380
-'Last? -After that you will
go to Mumbai right?'

1485
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:21,970
You will organize
great shows in Mumbai...'

1486
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:25,800
...and then long distance relationships
and then it won't be fun you know?'

1487
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:30,930
'Okay I will make
your mood still better.'

1488
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:36,970
-'Mumbai...
-You are not going right?'

1489
01:26:37,050 --> 01:26:38,800
'You are not going isn't it?
I knew it.'

1490
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,630
'I knew you would not
be able to stay without me.'

1491
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:43,180
'No I am not going
to Mumbai right now.'

1492
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:45,180
-'I have decided...
-Yes.'

1493
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:46,340
-'We will get married.
-Yes.'

1494
01:26:46,430 --> 01:26:47,590
-'You will start your job.
-Yes.'

1495
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:49,340
'You also take a
transfer to Mumbai then.'

1496
01:26:49,550 --> 01:26:51,970
'Sounds like a plan right? What?'

1497
01:26:52,590 --> 01:26:54,840
'Hey! Did you get your offer letter?'

1498
01:26:54,970 --> 01:26:56,930
-'No!
-Why?'

1499
01:26:57,550 --> 01:27:00,220
'I will go and pick it up later.
Why such haste?'

1500
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:01,760
'I will pick it up later.'

1501
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,720
'Sahil why do you
take this so lightly?'

1502
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:06,510
'People yearn for such jobs.'

1503
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:09,590
'One minute!'

1504
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:14,930
'You did not give this
interview as well right?'

1505
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:18,340
'What do you mean by this interview?
What have you started again?'

1506
01:27:18,430 --> 01:27:20,130
'What do you mean by
not gone for this interview?'

1507
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:22,340
'You are joking.'

1508
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:26,430
'Sahil I know.'

1509
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:28,930
'What do you know?'

1510
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:36,840
'That's enough now!
I am feeling ticklish.'

1511
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:40,340
-'You are looking very sexy.
-Yes.'

1512
01:27:40,430 --> 01:27:42,300
'Tell me how was your interview?'

1513
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:43,630
'Like how an interview is.'

1514
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,680
'Hey not like that!
What did they say?'

1515
01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:47,340
'The same thing again and again.'

1516
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:49,220
The same questions
and the same answers...'

1517
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:51,510
...and you will get a call if you are
selected. Just the normal routine.'

1518
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:54,340
'But what was their reaction?'

1519
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:57,880
'Reaction...'

1520
01:27:59,090 --> 01:28:01,550
-'Brilliant Sahil brilliant!
-Really?'

1521
01:28:01,630 --> 01:28:03,800
'Brilliant Anand brilliant!'

1522
01:28:04,090 --> 01:28:05,680
'You have a very strong chance!'

1523
01:28:06,010 --> 01:28:08,840
'And we also want employees like you
who are confident and risk taking.'

1524
01:28:08,970 --> 01:28:10,880
'Just pray that the
competition is not tough.'

1525
01:28:10,970 --> 01:28:15,590
'We also want employees like you
who are confident and risk taking.'

1526
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:21,340
'Just pray that the
competition is not tough.'

1527
01:28:22,550 --> 01:28:25,470
'Hey have this! I have ordered
for Chocolate Ganesh. Have it.'

1528
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:29,800
'Shall I order for
Vanilla ice cream for you?'

1529
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:30,800
'Have it.'

1530
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:33,970
'Whenever Sahil lies his legs shake.'

1531
01:28:34,630 --> 01:28:37,380
'He never knew about this but I knew.'

1532
01:28:38,010 --> 01:28:39,800
'That day he was lying.'

1533
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:44,220
'Mother and father are planning
the engagement and the wedding.'

1534
01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:46,970
'So tell them that
you are still not ready.'

1535
01:28:51,220 --> 01:28:52,550
'What do you mean by I am not ready?'

1536
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:56,510
'I am educated. I love you.'

1537
01:28:57,220 --> 01:28:59,300
'What more do you want than that?'

1538
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:00,880
'According to you is that enough?'

1539
01:29:01,630 --> 01:29:03,800
'Oh! Okay!'

1540
01:29:05,050 --> 01:29:06,470
'I don't have a job right?'

1541
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:10,180
'If I wish I can get a package
of fifty lakhs. Fifty lakhs!'

1542
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:12,430
-'What are you saying... -I have
heard this also fifty lakhs times.'

1543
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:15,590
'You know what? I am done.'

1544
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,930
'Harshita! Harshita!'

1545
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:26,880
Listen! Why do you
think that I can't get a job?'

1546
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:28,680
-'When did I say that?
-What did you say then?'

1547
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:31,800
'If you are getting a job do it.'

1548
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:35,430
'With that your problem
will get solved right?'

1549
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:37,340
-'What problem?
-One minute!'

1550
01:29:40,090 --> 01:29:41,090
-'Hold this!
-What?'

1551
01:29:42,430 --> 01:29:43,630
'I will be back in ten minutes.'

1552
01:29:44,630 --> 01:29:45,930
'Sahil!'

1553
01:29:46,510 --> 01:29:48,510
'He returned in ten
minutes with a job.'

1554
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:51,090
He became an accounts
professor just to show me...'

1555
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:52,510
...and not for himself.'

1556
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,970
'He does not know
what he wants to do.'

1557
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:59,590
'Some people know what they
want to do but some people take time.'

1558
01:29:59,970 --> 01:30:03,470
'And I wished the same that
Sahil takes time before marriage.'

1559
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:04,930
'Who has come? Who has come?'

1560
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:08,470
Dhwani Gautam!
He is a very famous director...'

1561
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:10,430
...and he also has a
talent management company.'

1562
01:30:10,510 --> 01:30:13,470
'He has given me tonight's show 
so bye.'

1563
01:30:13,550 --> 01:30:17,090
'My concern for Sahil became
a misunderstanding for him.'

1564
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:20,430
'And because of that misunderstanding
he started losing faith in me.'

1565
01:30:20,510 --> 01:30:23,260
-'Hi Dhwani! How are you?
-Hi!'

1566
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:25,050
-'I am good. How are you?
-Very good.'

1567
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:26,220
'Were you in a meeting?'

1568
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:28,510
'No I was having coffee
with my boyfriend.'

1569
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:32,090
So tell your boyfriend to get
habituated to having coffee alone...'

1570
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:33,970
...because Harshita Mehta
is going to become a great star.'

1571
01:30:34,050 --> 01:30:35,930
-'Oh please! That's sweet!
-Harshita!'

1572
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,180
Chocolate Ganache!'

1573
01:30:38,930 --> 01:30:40,010
'Thank you.'

1574
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:42,340
-'This is Sahil...
-Hi! Sahil!'

1575
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:43,630
-'Her boyfriend.
-Yes she told me.'

1576
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:45,840
-'Dhwani! I have my own...
-Yes she told me.'

1577
01:30:46,550 --> 01:30:47,800
-'So shall we leave?
-Yeah!'

1578
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:48,930
-'Let's go.
-Which way are you going?'

1579
01:30:48,970 --> 01:30:49,880
'What?'

1580
01:30:51,130 --> 01:30:53,880
'I have a show so we
are going for the rehearsal.'

1581
01:30:54,090 --> 01:30:55,260
'Did you get advance payment?'

1582
01:30:55,970 --> 01:30:57,840
-'What?
-Advance payment!'

1583
01:30:58,220 --> 01:30:59,050
'Did you give her?'

1584
01:31:00,430 --> 01:31:03,800
'My company pays the
artist after the job is done.'

1585
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:05,130
-'I think we discussed this.
-Yeah yeah of course...'

1586
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:07,220
'Harshita don't work
without an advance payment.'

1587
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:10,130
Yes I mean don't feel
bad but many such companies...'

1588
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:11,880
...open in the morning
and close down in the evening.'

1589
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:14,380
-'Sahil! -We will have to see
to our safety isn't it?'

1590
01:31:15,130 --> 01:31:18,800
I am so sorry. Actually as
we did not discuss this earlier so...'

1591
01:31:19,430 --> 01:31:23,010
'I am sorry Harshita.
I think both of you first discuss.'

1592
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:25,430
'We will forget about this show.
We will do something in future.'

1593
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:26,630
'Dhwani!'

1594
01:31:27,010 --> 01:31:28,010
'Nice meeting you.'

1595
01:31:31,630 --> 01:31:32,550
'Okay!'

1596
01:31:34,050 --> 01:31:35,050
'What did I do?'

1597
01:31:36,050 --> 01:31:38,970
After two days 
what time I leave home...'

1598
01:31:39,090 --> 01:31:42,590
...what time I return home 
who do I meet? What do I do?'

1599
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:45,300
'Sahil started keeping a watch on me.'

1600
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:49,930
'Sorry my Samosu.
We will plan something soon. Okay?'

1601
01:31:49,970 --> 01:31:50,970
'What do you mean soon?'

1602
01:31:51,050 --> 01:31:52,800
'We were supposed to have breakfast
together tomorrow morning.'

1603
01:31:52,970 --> 01:31:55,840
'I will not be able to come.
I am very tired.'

1604
01:31:56,550 --> 01:31:59,630
'Okay I will disconnect now.
Okay bye.'

1605
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:04,470
'Sahil started thinking
that my world is changing.'

1606
01:32:04,970 --> 01:32:08,050
But just so he doesn't feel that,
I called him again.'

1607
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:13,180
'Tomorrow morning 8:30 am
at breakfast club or Iscon Gaathiya?'

1608
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,260
'Tell us what do you have
piping hot for breakfast?'

1609
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:16,760
'Vanela'(Hand-made gram rolls) 
'Fafdaa' (thick and crisp fried sticks)'

1610
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:17,720
Bhavnagri' (noodle
shaped gram sticks) etc...

1611
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:20,760
-'Okay do one thing then. Give me
250 grams of 'Fafdaa'... -Okay.'

1612
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:22,970
-'250 grams of 'Vanela'.
-I want to eat 'Bhavnagri'.'

1613
01:32:23,010 --> 01:32:24,510
-'You want to eat 'Bhavnagri'?
Do one thing. -Yes.'

1614
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:25,970
250 grams Bhavnagri...'

1615
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:27,260
...100 grams Fafd'
and 100 grams Vanela.'

1616
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:28,800
-'Done. -But what about
fried bread and dry curry?'

1617
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,470
-'Of course! Yummy!
-Yes then...'

1618
01:32:30,590 --> 01:32:32,380
-'Okay ten fried bread and dry curry.
-And extra chilies.'

1619
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:35,090
-'Yes! -Sir this will be
too much for two people.'

1620
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:36,930
'Look please don't
talk like a gym instructor.'

1621
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:38,680
'Quickly go and get it.'

1622
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:39,630
See what he says...'

1623
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,510
'Good we did not
go to Breakfast Club.'

1624
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:43,590
Yes! They serve us sweet 'Handvo'
(mix cereal vegetable cake)...'

1625
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:44,880
...in the name of pancake.
Useless people.'

1626
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:48,010
'Sweet vegetable cake?
I will use this joke in my show.'

1627
01:32:48,090 --> 01:32:49,340
-'Is that so?
-Yes.'

1628
01:32:49,970 --> 01:32:51,840
'Why only this joke?
I will lay my life for you.'

1629
01:32:52,970 --> 01:32:54,720
Next time if I get confused
while writing jokes...'

1630
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,340
...I will bring you
to Iscon Gathiyaa only.'

1631
01:32:56,630 --> 01:32:58,880
-'So I will wish that you get
confused every day. -Yes?'

1632
01:32:58,970 --> 01:33:03,380
'I mean we will write jokes 
we will eat gram crispy sticks.'

1633
01:33:03,970 --> 01:33:06,260
'We will go to the gym.
We will enjoy life.'

1634
01:33:06,340 --> 01:33:07,630
-'Life full of fun right?
-Yes.'

1635
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:09,180
-'Come on bring it quickly!
-Hurry up!'

1636
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:10,590
-'Yes here are your hot piping gram
crispy sticks. -Oh my God!'

1637
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:11,760
'Great!'

1638
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:15,970
-'See there sir.
-It's delicious isn't it?'

1639
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:20,380
'Good morning sir!'

1640
01:33:20,630 --> 01:33:24,550
All of you here... have you
come here to have gram crispy sticks?'

1641
01:33:24,630 --> 01:33:27,590
-'No! We have come to roll them.
-Yes.'

1642
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:31,220
'We got leave as
you had a stomach ache.'

1643
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:33,970
'But sir 
shall I give you free advice?'

1644
01:33:34,010 --> 01:33:38,470
'You should not eat gram
sticks when you have stomach ache.'

1645
01:33:38,930 --> 01:33:42,510
'Hey she is that one isn't it?
Her jokes are awesome.'

1646
01:33:42,590 --> 01:33:44,590
-'They will screw me.
-Follow her on Instagram.'

1647
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:45,800
'You will enjoy!'

1648
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:50,380
'Sahil I know!'

1649
01:33:51,630 --> 01:33:52,550
'What do you know?'

1650
01:33:53,130 --> 01:33:56,880
'You go to give interviews
but you don't attend them.'

1651
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:59,260
'What nonsense are you talking?'

1652
01:33:59,630 --> 01:34:01,840
'You go to give interviews
but you don't attend them.'

1653
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:03,130
'You are just blabbering.'

1654
01:34:05,050 --> 01:34:08,430
'Sahil you can talk to me.'

1655
01:34:09,630 --> 01:34:12,090
'Please! Talk to me.'

1656
01:34:14,130 --> 01:34:15,340
'Come I will drop you home.'

1657
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,340
-'It's getting late.
-Your American internship also...'

1658
01:34:18,430 --> 01:34:20,300
...you left halfway
and returned in six months.'

1659
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:23,550
'Sahil I read your Emails.'

1660
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:27,840
Your seniors tried their
best to stop you but...'

1661
01:34:28,550 --> 01:34:30,260
...but you did not even
send an answer to them.'

1662
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:33,380
'Why Sahil?'

1663
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:40,930
'Come let's go! Day after
tomorrow you have your show right?'

1664
01:34:41,010 --> 01:34:42,800
'You might have to
go for rehearsal for that.'

1665
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:44,050
'Come you will be late.'

1666
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:45,010
-'Why do you want people
to wait for you. -Sahil!'

1667
01:34:45,090 --> 01:34:46,470
-'Come let's go.
-Sahil please...'

1668
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:48,220
-'Please...
-Why did you read my emails?'

1669
01:34:50,630 --> 01:34:52,130
'Why did you read my emails?'

1670
01:34:52,970 --> 01:34:54,220
'Do I check your phone?'

1671
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,090
'Do I check your messages?'

1672
01:34:56,970 --> 01:34:58,220
'You are spying on me?'

1673
01:34:58,340 --> 01:35:01,590
'Sahil I wanted to help you.'

1674
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:03,090
'I don't want your help!'

1675
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:06,300
'Keep quiet! I don't want your help.'

1676
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:08,720
'Chill Sahil! Relax!'

1677
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:10,260
'You are trying to dominate over me?'

1678
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:14,130
'All the time… why don't you work?
Why don't you do this?'

1679
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:16,550
'Go and give interviews 
take up a job. Why?'

1680
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:18,840
'Sahil I am concerned for you.'

1681
01:35:18,930 --> 01:35:20,550
'You are concerned about me.
Great! Very good.'

1682
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:23,760
'You are not concerned about me.
You are ashamed of me.'

1683
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,880
-'No Sahil it is not like that. No!
-It is like that!'

1684
01:35:27,090 --> 01:35:29,720
'When your friends ask you 
what does your boyfriend do?'

1685
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,340
'You don't have an answer then.'

1686
01:35:31,470 --> 01:35:33,180
You might be feeling
shy to say that...'

1687
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:34,880
'My boyfriend does not do anything.'

1688
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:35,970
'He sits at home and enjoys his life.'

1689
01:35:36,010 --> 01:35:37,970
-'Sahil it is not like that Sahil...
-It is like that!'

1690
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:47,090
'What am I doing? What am I up to?'

1691
01:35:56,550 --> 01:35:57,760
'Come.'

1692
01:36:00,550 --> 01:36:01,800
'Come I will drop you home.'

1693
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,340
'You have to prepare for your show 
isn't it?'

1694
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:06,180
'Let's go.'

1695
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:08,090
'And then I have
to go for interviews.'

1696
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:10,630
-'No please...
-I have to focus on that now. Focus!'

1697
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:15,010
-'Come.
-No!'

1698
01:36:15,090 --> 01:36:16,470
'Take your bag. Come on.'

1699
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:18,340
'Come on take your bag.'

1700
01:36:19,090 --> 01:36:20,130
'No!'

1701
01:36:21,630 --> 01:36:22,930
'Leave!'

1702
01:37:20,470 --> 01:37:21,510
He is sleeping.

1703
01:37:22,430 --> 01:37:23,470
Shall I wake him up?

1704
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:26,800
No aunty!

1705
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,880
This is...

1706
01:37:44,550 --> 01:37:45,720
Sorry aunty!

1707
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:56,760
I...

1708
01:37:58,010 --> 01:38:00,050
I will not be able
to come today evening.

1709
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:05,720
I can understand.

1710
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,550
No! It's not that!

1711
01:38:07,970 --> 01:38:13,050
As I am going to Mumbai
today I have to do my packing.

1712
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:15,840
But I spoke to uncle Tribhuvan
and have arranged...

1713
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:17,630
...everything for today evening.

1714
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:20,380
So...

1715
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:25,840
I will leave now.

1716
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:48,720
Mother!

1717
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:50,590
Are you awake?

1718
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:52,970
Yes, I mean...

1719
01:38:53,930 --> 01:38:54,970
I just woke up.

1720
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:02,340
Harshita is going to Mumbai tonight.

1721
01:39:04,180 --> 01:39:06,050
Son why did you breakup?

1722
01:39:09,430 --> 01:39:11,220
She could never understand me.

1723
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:13,470
Only she could understand you.

1724
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:21,470
But now after the divorce it
is pointless talking about all this.

1725
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:23,880
Mother! Mother!

1726
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:29,220
Between divorce and breakup...

1727
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:32,050
The only difference is marriage.

1728
01:39:33,470 --> 01:39:35,840
Son the only thing
left was staying together.

1729
01:39:53,430 --> 01:39:54,510
Hail Lord Sitaram!

1730
01:39:55,430 --> 01:39:56,630
I have brought the flowers.

1731
01:39:58,630 --> 01:40:00,090
Sister-in-law 
you are still not ready...

1732
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:02,090
-Softly!
-You are still not ready?

1733
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:03,720
But why did you come early?

1734
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:05,260
The best man has to come early.

1735
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:08,470
But we still have to arrange the flowers.
We still have to do the decoration.

1736
01:40:08,550 --> 01:40:09,970
I will do all that.

1737
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:12,930
You go out and see
that no one comes in.

1738
01:40:13,010 --> 01:40:14,430
Yes I will see to that.

1739
01:40:15,220 --> 01:40:17,840
So good for nothing! Why
are you standing like a statue here?

1740
01:40:17,930 --> 01:40:19,260
Don't you want to get ready?

1741
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:22,760
Why are you so dressed up?

1742
01:40:22,930 --> 01:40:25,010
Don't you know? Ask your mother.

1743
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:26,930
Now look at him!

1744
01:40:27,130 --> 01:40:30,010
Mother what preparations
are going on here?

1745
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:32,380
Why is he telling me to get ready?

1746
01:40:32,470 --> 01:40:34,380
Flowers and everything have come.

1747
01:40:37,630 --> 01:40:44,380
Oh no! Oh no! I am so sorry mother!

1748
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:48,510
Oh no! How could I forget this day?

1749
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:54,590
Mother it just slipped out of my mind.

1750
01:40:55,010 --> 01:40:56,630
Mother all this and all that...

1751
01:40:56,720 --> 01:40:58,260
Mother I am really sorry.

1752
01:40:58,510 --> 01:41:00,970
Happy anniversary. Okay.
I am so sorry!

1753
01:41:01,010 --> 01:41:02,380
It just slipped out of my mind.

1754
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:04,050
You tell me... let me do some work.

1755
01:41:04,130 --> 01:41:05,050
What shall I do?

1756
01:41:05,130 --> 01:41:06,470
Shall I arrange all the flowers?

1757
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:08,130
You just tell me.
Shall I decorate them nicely here?

1758
01:41:08,220 --> 01:41:10,550
-No! Let it be. You let it be.
-I will do everything.

1759
01:41:11,050 --> 01:41:14,930
Your uncle Tribhuvan and
Harshita have done everything.

1760
01:41:15,630 --> 01:41:17,090
-But if you wish to do something.
-Yes.

1761
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:19,590
-Keep your father busy.
-Okay.

1762
01:41:19,930 --> 01:41:21,800
-And see that he does not
come out of the room. -Okay.

1763
01:41:22,130 --> 01:41:22,840
Fine.

1764
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:24,930
I will not allow him to come.

1765
01:41:25,300 --> 01:41:26,430
I will stop him.

1766
01:41:27,380 --> 01:41:28,300
Mother!

1767
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:31,550
Happy anniversary.

1768
01:41:32,470 --> 01:41:33,760
Mother you know...

1769
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:36,510
You are the world's best mother.

1770
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:41,180
And I am the worst son.

1771
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:47,130
Happy anniversary!

1772
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:48,680
Go now!

1773
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:57,890
Father...

1774
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:04,560
Happy anniversary.

1775
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:07,430
Thank you! You remembered?

1776
01:42:08,310 --> 01:42:12,720
Father I can never remember
birthdays and anniversaries.

1777
01:42:13,470 --> 01:42:16,220
Since past two years
Harshita would remind me...

1778
01:42:17,260 --> 01:42:18,720
She should have reminded me today.

1779
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:20,260
But she never did.

1780
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:23,260
Why will she remind you now?

1781
01:42:23,510 --> 01:42:28,510
After what you have done
she is not responsible for anything.

1782
01:42:29,390 --> 01:42:30,470
Correct!

1783
01:42:31,140 --> 01:42:33,100
I have done everything
and it is only my fault.

1784
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:35,600
She is not at fault at all. I
have been hearing this since morning.

1785
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:39,060
-I don't wish to say anything.
-No you speak.

1786
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:41,310
Say all that you wish
to say once and for all.

1787
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:44,310
You speaking at intervals troubles me.

1788
01:42:48,470 --> 01:42:50,430
Take this! Gargle first.

1789
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:51,760
-Everything...
-You are angry...

1790
01:42:51,810 --> 01:42:53,060
...and in anger, a person...

1791
01:42:53,510 --> 01:42:55,640
...only hears does not listen.

1792
01:42:56,060 --> 01:42:56,850
Take this!

1793
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:13,010
Tell me.

1794
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:20,890
Do you know after your
graduation I had a desire that...

1795
01:43:21,010 --> 01:43:26,430
...one day we both like friends should
sit on the terrace with a bottle...

1796
01:43:27,470 --> 01:43:29,560
...and discuss about your future plans.

1797
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:33,060
The discussion would
be the same typical one...

1798
01:43:33,970 --> 01:43:36,600
...which every father has with his son.

1799
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:39,560
But I wanted to do
that being a little cool.

1800
01:43:40,310 --> 01:43:42,560
But you turned out
to be more than that.

1801
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:47,510
You brought Harshita for
dinner the day I was going...

1802
01:43:48,010 --> 01:43:50,850
...to discuss this with you.

1803
01:43:51,930 --> 01:43:53,470
So we could not discuss anything.

1804
01:43:54,510 --> 01:43:58,850
But I felt at peace
when I met Harshita.

1805
01:43:59,930 --> 01:44:00,850
Great!

1806
01:44:02,310 --> 01:44:03,760
My son has a good choice.

1807
01:44:05,850 --> 01:44:06,890
And I told Josu...

1808
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:09,680
...that our Sahil will
never need our help now...

1809
01:44:10,310 --> 01:44:11,890
...if he ever gets confused.

1810
01:44:12,510 --> 01:44:14,010
Harshita will take care of him.

1811
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:17,010
As it is he is going
to listen to her now.

1812
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:22,100
Sahil will feel what she says more
relatable and what we say typical.

1813
01:44:25,390 --> 01:44:31,180
Children feel that only till
college it's their responsibility...

1814
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:32,760
...to be answerable to their parents.

1815
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:35,720
But it is not like that!

1816
01:44:37,010 --> 01:44:40,970
In fact after college it is
the responsibility of the parents...

1817
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:45,310
...to stop asking questions
from their children.

1818
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:52,060
We stopped asking questions...

1819
01:44:53,220 --> 01:44:57,010
...and you stopped talking to us.

1820
01:44:58,220 --> 01:44:59,850
Since the past one
and a half to two years...

1821
01:44:59,970 --> 01:45:03,060
...you have been taking
jobs and leaving them.

1822
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:05,810
For months together
you are sitting at home.

1823
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:10,390
What did you think...

1824
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:13,720
...wasn't I observing all this?

1825
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:18,600
I was not asking you anything...

1826
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:21,140
...but that does not mean...

1827
01:45:21,890 --> 01:45:23,810
...I was not concerned for you.

1828
01:45:30,430 --> 01:45:31,760
I did not speak to you.

1829
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:34,640
Correct.

1830
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:39,470
But why didn't you question me?

1831
01:45:50,810 --> 01:45:52,260
That is because I was sure...

1832
01:45:53,850 --> 01:45:56,310
...that Harshita would
speak to you about this.

1833
01:45:57,850 --> 01:46:03,720
I had faith in Harshita more
than the concern I had for you...

1834
01:46:04,470 --> 01:46:05,890
...that she would help you.

1835
01:46:06,850 --> 01:46:09,970
As to what you wish to do in life.

1836
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:13,140
She would push you into deep waters...

1837
01:46:14,220 --> 01:46:16,930
...and you would struggle to swim.

1838
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:20,930
And I also had immense faith...

1839
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:24,560
...that she would never let you drown.

1840
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:28,510
But you never gave her a chance.

1841
01:46:31,890 --> 01:46:34,010
When she started making an effort...

1842
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:37,470
...you deserted her.

1843
01:46:39,890 --> 01:46:44,640
When I told you that there is nothing
wrong being an accounts professor...

1844
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:50,060
We had no problem if you
wanted to do that job all your life.

1845
01:46:54,850 --> 01:46:58,100
But you don't wish to
make an effort to do anything...

1846
01:46:59,310 --> 01:47:01,640
...with the fear of failure or losing.

1847
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:05,810
That is what hurts me the most.

1848
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:10,220
What is it that you fear?

1849
01:47:13,180 --> 01:47:16,680
If you don't face fear
how will you overcome it?

1850
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:23,970
Harshita just wanted
you to face your fears.

1851
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:34,970
Like a girl's father is concerned...

1852
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:37,850
...as to what kind of
a son-in-law will he get...

1853
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:40,810
...in the same way a boy's
father is also concerned...

1854
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:43,850
...as to what kind of
a daughter-in-law will he get.

1855
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:48,850
Harshita was that girl for you.

1856
01:47:52,010 --> 01:47:55,760
She was just trying to take
you out from your comfort zone.

1857
01:47:58,850 --> 01:48:02,180
You said right. It is your fault.

1858
01:48:08,890 --> 01:48:10,560
She is not at fault at all.

1859
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:22,850
Hey! Whose wedding procession
is this beneath our house?

1860
01:48:22,890 --> 01:48:24,310
-It is yours!
-It is yours!

1861
01:48:24,430 --> 01:48:26,260
Hey what are you all doing here?

1862
01:48:26,350 --> 01:48:28,510
Just see what a beautiful
turban I got for you.

1863
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:29,810
-Come on wear this!
-But...

1864
01:48:29,850 --> 01:48:31,260
You now look like a groom now.

1865
01:48:31,350 --> 01:48:32,930
-Wow!
-The horse is waiting downstairs...

1866
01:48:33,010 --> 01:48:34,430
-...but the groom is here.
-Come on let's go.

1867
01:48:34,510 --> 01:48:35,510
-Come on let's go!
-Come on...

1868
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:36,680
-Yes let's go.
-This is a big surprise for you.

1869
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:37,680
-Let's go down.
-You move ahead.

1870
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,850
-Come on let's go.
-You're looking nice.

1871
01:48:38,930 --> 01:48:40,060
How does this turban look?

1872
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:41,850
It's perfect. You look like a groom.

1873
01:48:41,890 --> 01:48:43,470
How are you? How are you?

1874
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:45,260
Oh! Hello! Hello!

1875
01:48:45,890 --> 01:48:48,060
Oh my! A mare!

1876
01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:49,430
You have arranged
my wedding procession?

1877
01:48:49,510 --> 01:48:51,100
Thank you. Thank you.

1878
01:48:51,180 --> 01:48:52,970
Say thank you to your bride.

1879
01:48:53,060 --> 01:48:54,970
-This is sister-in-law's idea.
-Is that so?

1880
01:48:55,060 --> 01:48:57,470
Come we still have to
get you on the horse. Yes.

1881
01:50:04,010 --> 01:50:05,180
One minute, one minute. Let me go...

1882
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:06,640
Move aside move aside...

1883
01:50:07,510 --> 01:50:08,510
Hey son!

1884
01:50:09,010 --> 01:50:10,060
Where are you going?

1885
01:50:10,180 --> 01:50:11,680
That...

1886
01:50:12,010 --> 01:50:12,850
To patch up!

1887
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:14,010
What is that?

1888
01:50:14,260 --> 01:50:15,100
That means...

1889
01:50:15,180 --> 01:50:17,600
Mother all this is very
common in our generation.

1890
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:19,260
Patch up means...

1891
01:50:19,350 --> 01:50:20,930
Son say something
which I can understand.

1892
01:50:21,260 --> 01:50:24,060
Patch up means the old ties...

1893
01:50:25,510 --> 01:50:27,890
You will understand in a while. Yes.

1894
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:31,810
Listen!

1895
01:50:37,970 --> 01:50:39,720
Father! Father!

1896
01:50:40,140 --> 01:50:41,970
Sahil click my snap!

01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:43,390
#myweddingprocession.

1898
01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:44,600
Father I wish to tell you...

1899
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:46,680
-Father...
-Do you wish to sit here?

1900
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:48,060
-Come here come...
-I don't want to sit.

1901
01:50:48,140 --> 01:50:50,600
I want to ask you. I want to ask you.

1902
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:51,760
What is it?

1903
01:50:52,310 --> 01:50:56,100
Father when mother
took me to uncle's house...

1904
01:50:56,180 --> 01:50:57,930
What? Your mother forgot
to invite your uncle?

1905
01:50:58,010 --> 01:51:00,390
Oh my God! Father also does not...

1906
01:51:00,470 --> 01:51:01,640
Silence!

1907
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:03,220
What?

1908
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:06,220
Oh no!

1909
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:08,180
Uncle Tribhuvan lift me up.

1910
01:51:08,310 --> 01:51:10,350
-Yes.
-Come on pick him up!

1911
01:51:10,430 --> 01:51:14,810
Father, when mother never used
to return from uncle's house...

1912
01:51:14,850 --> 01:51:17,010
-...after your arguments..
-Yes.

1913
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:18,510
What did you go and tell her then?

1914
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:21,310
I went there on my
scooter and told her that...

1915
01:51:21,430 --> 01:51:24,060
...relations and scooter
do face a problem.

1916
01:51:24,180 --> 01:51:26,430
At times you need to do servicing.

1917
01:51:26,930 --> 01:51:27,850
Take this!

1918
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:32,350
Come on play the band!

1919
01:51:33,810 --> 01:51:35,060
Yes come on!

1920
01:51:57,720 --> 01:52:01,430
Mamma... Mamma please don't cry. Please!

1921
01:52:01,510 --> 01:52:03,140
My child I will feel sad.

1922
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:06,640
First time you are
going so far away from me.

1923
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:08,890
That's enough now. Stop crying.

1924
01:52:08,970 --> 01:52:11,010
She is going to Mumbai
and not Madagascar.

1925
01:52:12,010 --> 01:52:13,890
-And listen my child.
-Yes.

1926
01:52:13,970 --> 01:52:15,560
Don't remove your
hand out of the window.

1927
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:19,930
-Go safely my child.
-Yes.

1928
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:22,100
My dear atleast let
us come to bid you farewell?

1929
01:52:22,180 --> 01:52:24,060
No I am going. Okay?

1930
01:52:24,140 --> 01:52:25,760
-Bye!
-Okay bye!

1931
01:52:32,850 --> 01:52:34,850
Why I must have said Madagascar?

1932
01:52:36,060 --> 01:52:38,260
Oh! Wedding style!

1933
01:52:38,810 --> 01:52:42,430
Come on hurry up! Hurry up!

1934
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:44,100
Be quick! Come on!

1935
01:52:52,970 --> 01:52:53,970
My child your phone..

1936
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:17,350
I thought you were ignoring
but you had forgotten your phone...

1937
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:22,390
You go in the other lift.

1938
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:28,260
Which is it?

1939
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:30,850
Which is your flight?

1940
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:34,850
Listen...

1941
01:53:35,180 --> 01:53:36,220
Harshita!

1942
01:53:37,220 --> 01:53:38,100
Harshita!

1943
01:53:38,890 --> 01:53:41,010
Harshita give me two minutes
and listen to what I want to say.

1944
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:42,140
I only want to say that...

1945
01:53:43,350 --> 01:53:45,100
Let's go by lift.

1946
01:53:46,100 --> 01:53:47,810
What I want to say is...

1947
01:53:52,850 --> 01:53:54,640
Please don't follow me.

1948
01:53:55,060 --> 01:53:56,310
Okay you wish to walk down?

1949
01:53:56,640 --> 01:53:59,100
I will carry your bag. But why...

1950
01:53:59,810 --> 01:54:01,930
Didn't I tell you?
Just leave me alone.

1951
01:54:02,010 --> 01:54:04,350
But why are you walking
down with so much weight?

1952
01:54:04,430 --> 01:54:06,180
I... I will manage.

1953
01:54:07,970 --> 01:54:10,810
But Harshita I will not
be able to manage without you.

1954
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:16,010
Harshita today I have come to...
you know like...

1955
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:18,850
I have come to expose
myself in front of you.

1956
01:54:18,930 --> 01:54:20,470
No I mean not in that way...

1957
01:54:21,430 --> 01:54:25,060
Where should I begin from?
I really don't understand.

1958
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:30,560
Harshita I always stood
first right from school to college.

1959
01:54:31,850 --> 01:54:34,260
After I completed my
college I realized that...

1960
01:54:34,810 --> 01:54:37,760
...the outer world is so
different from school and college.

1961
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:43,100
And I had this fear what
if I fail in this outer world?

1962
01:54:44,470 --> 01:54:46,470
What will my parents think!

1963
01:54:47,350 --> 01:54:48,810
What will you think!

1964
01:54:51,100 --> 01:54:53,810
That means in your heart
you decided as to what I will think.

1965
01:54:54,810 --> 01:54:56,060
-Just once...
-Wait a minute.

1966
01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:59,060
Don't talk I will get confused.

1967
01:54:59,180 --> 01:55:00,720
What was I saying?

1968
01:55:02,010 --> 01:55:06,010
Harshita 
one thing I understood today.

1969
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:09,180
I have a fear that I will fail.

1970
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:10,510
Let me carry this.

1971
01:55:11,010 --> 01:55:13,310
But I did not do anything
to get over this fear.

1972
01:55:13,430 --> 01:55:16,810
You have reached till here
only because of your courage.

1973
01:55:18,390 --> 01:55:19,930
Do you remember your first show?

1974
01:55:21,010 --> 01:55:23,810
You cracked the first joke.
No one laughed.

1975
01:55:25,060 --> 01:55:27,600
Then with courage you cracked
the second and then the third...

1976
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:30,140
...then the fourth and the fifth...

1977
01:55:33,180 --> 01:55:37,850
Harshita! I liked you only
because of your courage Harshita.

1978
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:42,100
I am such a duffer isn't it?

1979
01:55:45,470 --> 01:55:47,220
I never learnt anything from you.

1980
01:55:53,470 --> 01:55:55,970
My male ego has ruined everything.

1981
01:56:00,180 --> 01:56:01,930
Why you used to love me so much?

1982
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:03,970
Tell me.

1983
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:05,640
Why?

1984
01:56:06,140 --> 01:56:09,310
You have always tried
to set things right.

1985
01:56:10,220 --> 01:56:12,510
But I ruined everything in a minute.

1986
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:27,680
Harshita!

1987
01:56:36,220 --> 01:56:39,060
Harshita 
I am really ashamed of myself.

1988
01:56:42,810 --> 01:56:45,180
I have treated you very badly.

1989
01:56:48,890 --> 01:56:50,310
Sorry!

1990
01:56:52,350 --> 01:56:55,310
I still do not know
what I want to do in life.

1991
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:58,140
But one thing is definite.

1992
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:02,680
No matter how much success
I achieve in life...

1993
01:57:05,470 --> 01:57:06,890
...but if you are not with me...

1994
01:57:07,010 --> 01:57:09,680
...then that will be the
greatest failure of my life.

1995
01:57:15,430 --> 01:57:18,180
This time I will
think that I will fail.

1996
01:57:21,260 --> 01:57:23,510
But before that I wish
to try just once. Please!

1997
01:57:30,810 --> 01:57:32,760
Please give me one chance.

1998
01:57:41,850 --> 01:57:45,600
Idiot! That's what
I have been trying to say.

1999
01:57:47,680 --> 01:57:50,720
Give yourself a chance to fall.

2000
01:57:52,430 --> 01:57:55,810
Who told you that
you should be perfect?

2001
01:57:57,600 --> 01:58:00,140
At times you might fail 
at times I might fail.

2002
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:05,970
This relationship will become
perfect only with our imperfections.

2003
01:58:08,510 --> 01:58:09,470
Am I right?

2004
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:12,890
Shall I tell you the truth?
I was very scared today.

2005
01:58:13,970 --> 01:58:17,310
In Mumbai if no one
laughs at my jokes...

2006
01:58:18,060 --> 01:58:20,310
...and if you are not standing in front
of me with a glass of water...

2007
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:23,010
What would I do then?

2008
01:58:26,720 --> 01:58:27,510
Let us...

2009
01:58:28,470 --> 01:58:29,430
Let us...

2010
01:58:29,510 --> 01:58:31,760
Let's become each other’s again please!

2011
01:58:32,390 --> 01:58:33,600
Yes!

2012
01:58:45,510 --> 01:58:47,760
Who has booked an Uber
to go to the airport?

2013
01:58:53,180 --> 01:58:54,060
You called for it?

2014
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:56,640
-No!
-Even I did not book one.

2015
01:58:57,930 --> 01:58:58,970
Not us!

2016
01:58:59,930 --> 01:59:02,810
Wonder from where they
send such fake addresses.

2017
01:59:10,970 --> 01:59:12,600
Come.

2018
01:59:16,930 --> 01:59:19,010
Carry my bags now.

2019
01:59:19,140 --> 01:59:21,010
I was telling you that
from the fourth floor...

2020
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:22,720
-...that I will carry your bags.
-My hands...

2021
02:00:04,220 --> 02:00:10,060
Now I understood what patch up means.

2022
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:19,810
Hello Mumbai! How are you?

2023
02:00:20,060 --> 02:00:21,220
This is Harshita!

2024
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:23,890
For the first time I am feeling
nice after coming out from Gujarat.

2025
02:00:23,970 --> 02:00:26,850
And seeing an open bar
I am feeling all the more better.

2026
02:00:27,310 --> 02:00:30,510
Well there are a few
differences here and in my city.

2027
02:00:30,930 --> 02:00:35,310
Your city is known for metro
and our city is known for friends!

2028
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:39,260
We speak in Gujarati there
and here you speak in Marathi.

2029
02:00:39,390 --> 02:00:41,350
Only when the policeman catches you...

2030
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:43,600
Sir please let me go.

2031
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:45,720
That's all you need to
know to survive in this city.

2032
02:00:46,060 --> 02:00:47,720
But there is one similarity.

2033
02:00:48,310 --> 02:00:51,850
Here the names of places
change in different languages.

2034
02:00:51,890 --> 02:00:54,510
In English it is Bandra.
In Hindi Bandra...

2035
02:00:54,600 --> 02:00:55,810
...and in Marathi Vandre!

2036
02:00:56,180 --> 02:00:58,680
Same to same in English Ahmedabad.

2037
02:00:58,810 --> 02:01:02,640
In Hindi Ahamdabad! But in Gujarati 
I want to go to Amdavad!

2038
02:01:05,220 --> 02:01:10,010
Well thank you so much both of
you for being such a lovely audience.

2039
02:01:19,180 --> 02:01:20,260
They were not even laughing.

2040
02:01:20,350 --> 02:01:22,140
They were continuously whispering
something to each other.

2041
02:01:22,220 --> 02:01:24,350
This is a new city.
Why do you get so angry?

2042
02:01:24,430 --> 02:01:25,930
You must gargle from time to time.

2043
02:01:26,010 --> 02:01:27,310
But why was there no audience?

2044
02:01:27,390 --> 02:01:28,930
You need to give some time in Mumbai.

2045
02:01:29,010 --> 02:01:31,600
But I have such a
big fan following online!

2046
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:33,260
People here know me.

2047
02:01:57,810 --> 02:02:00,350
Oh beautiful girl from Gujarat...

2048
02:02:00,430 --> 02:02:02,140
Listen to what I have to say!

2049
02:02:02,220 --> 02:02:05,680
I have sleepless nights.

2050
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:07,430
Oh beautiful girl from Gujarat...

2051
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:09,220
Listen to what I have to say!

2052
02:02:09,310 --> 02:02:12,810
I have sleepless nights.

2053
02:02:12,850 --> 02:02:16,060
I am very famous in
the whole of Gujarat...

2054
02:02:16,180 --> 02:02:19,890
I am very famous in
the whole of Gujarat...

2055
02:02:19,970 --> 02:02:26,260
Say yes just once and be mine.

2056
02:02:27,060 --> 02:02:28,810
Oh beautiful girl from Gujarat...

2057
02:02:28,850 --> 02:02:30,560
Listen to what I have to say!

2058
02:02:30,640 --> 02:02:34,140
I have sleepless nights.

2059
02:02:34,220 --> 02:02:35,850
Oh beautiful girl from Gujarat...

2060
02:02:35,970 --> 02:02:37,680
Listen to what I have to say!

2061
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:42,260
I have sleepless nights.

2062
02:02:54,310 --> 02:02:58,260
I am Mister Singh
and you Gujarati queen.

2063
02:02:58,390 --> 02:03:02,260
-"Is that so?
-Our love story is amazing!"

2064
02:03:02,390 --> 02:03:05,850
You mister King
and she Gujarati queen.

2065
02:03:05,890 --> 02:03:09,390
You and her love story is amazing.

2066
02:03:09,470 --> 02:03:11,470
Listen on, my beloved!

2067
02:03:11,560 --> 02:03:12,890
I am your Ambani!

2068
02:03:13,010 --> 02:03:14,760
Listen on, my beloved!

2069
02:03:14,810 --> 02:03:16,760
I am your Ambani!

2070
02:03:16,850 --> 02:03:23,180
My life is worthless without you.

2071
02:03:23,260 --> 02:03:26,100
Oh beautiful girl from Gujarat...

2072
02:03:27,430 --> 02:03:29,510
Listen to what I have to say!

2073
02:03:30,810 --> 02:03:32,810
Oh beautiful girl from Gujarat...

2074
02:03:32,850 --> 02:03:34,600
Listen to what I have to say!

2075
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:38,060
I have sleepless nights.

2076
02:03:38,140 --> 02:03:39,810
Oh beautiful girl from Gujarat...

2077
02:03:39,930 --> 02:03:41,680
Listen to what I have to say!

2078
02:03:41,810 --> 02:03:46,390
I have sleepless nights.
