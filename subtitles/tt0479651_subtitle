1
00:03:11,597 --> 00:03:15,192
My salutations to Tamil people
and a Indians.

2
00:03:16,235 --> 00:03:18,203
The honorable American President,

3
00:03:18,404 --> 00:03:22,170
the Indian prime minister and
the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.

4
00:03:22,275 --> 00:03:25,345
How I chanced to share this
historical stage with them and speak here

5
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:26,334
... is by itself a big story.

6
00:03:26,446 --> 00:03:28,448
In a way, it's a story about our world.

7
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:31,250
Not only that. it's a story
about a god too.

8
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,550
A question might arise, why a rational
scientist like me to tell a tale of god.

9
00:03:36,322 --> 00:03:41,123
The idol, Lord Govindaraja
is a proponent in this story.

10
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:44,530
Hence, this god's story has
to be told as well.

11
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,431
Stories abound about Lord Govindaraja.

12
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,696
The briefest version would still take us
back to the 12th century.

13
00:03:52,238 --> 00:03:54,365
So, 12th century.

14
00:03:54,607 --> 00:03:59,567
A time when Jesus and Allah hadn't
permeated India and it's politic.

15
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:03,308
Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu had
no other gods to fight and play with.

16
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:08,512
So... they fought a proxy war
through their devotees in the 12th century.

17
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:13,454
As life springs from womb, the laws
of the world springs from the Holy Wisdom.

18
00:04:13,626 --> 00:04:16,562
Pray at Their feet, sing praises
of Shiva and his conceit.

19
00:04:16,562 --> 00:04:19,190
That our way of Him
and sacred laws may be perpetuated.

20
00:04:39,585 --> 00:04:45,391
Amok in elephant, a religion in man.
madness results only in trouble.

21
00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:50,351
Kulothungan Cholan the Second
was fond of the Saivism.

22
00:04:50,563 --> 00:04:52,622
Religion culture turned into racism.

23
00:04:53,232 --> 00:04:55,234
At Thillai, in Shiva's temple.

24
00:04:55,234 --> 00:04:58,237
Lord Govindaraja was a co-tenant.

25
00:04:58,237 --> 00:05:00,364
Kulothungan Cholan, king of kings.

26
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:02,202
Ruled that the idol to be shifted.

27
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:05,139
But the truth, the idol was
pried loose.

28
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,589
Iâ€™m a disciple of Saint Ramanuja.

29
00:06:35,568 --> 00:06:37,559
Strength, Lord Narayana.

30
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:53,415
Hail.

31
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:57,387
Narayana, our Lord.

32
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,130
Tell the grandson of the Great Chola
who abolished taxes.

33
00:07:10,236 --> 00:07:11,430
That he must abolish his pride.

34
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:18,065
Tell him, Rangarajan Nambi says so.

35
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:24,271
The accursed king will add one more
grievous curse, that of a Brahmin.

36
00:07:41,634 --> 00:07:45,605
O, Giver of peace, You vanquish sin
in Thee we seek life and harmony.

37
00:07:45,605 --> 00:07:47,607
Thine the Universe
and the substance of skies.

38
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:50,242
Thine the darkness. Thine the light.

39
00:07:50,242 --> 00:07:54,213
Thou art nourishment. Thine all nature
Thou art perfection, Personified.

40
00:07:54,213 --> 00:07:55,414
In Thee. O, Lord of all creation.

41
00:07:55,414 --> 00:07:58,144
I seek freedom from fear.

42
00:08:41,327 --> 00:08:43,192
Nambi, look here.

43
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:05,417
O, king, do not harm my husband.

44
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:12,284
Rangarajan Nambi.

45
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:15,487
This stone shall be drowned in the sea.

46
00:09:16,095 --> 00:09:18,564
You have a family.
Go home.

47
00:09:18,564 --> 00:09:20,122
Don't make her a widow.

48
00:09:20,332 --> 00:09:24,200
The last man who refused to
betray Ramanuja was blinded.

49
00:09:25,237 --> 00:09:26,568
So, you know.

50
00:09:28,107 --> 00:09:31,304
I do not know where Ramanuja is.

51
00:09:32,344 --> 00:09:34,403
Even if do, I shall not tell you.

52
00:09:35,181 --> 00:09:36,382
Even in peril of death.

53
00:09:36,382 --> 00:09:38,441
If had so wished,
you'd be dead already.

54
00:09:39,485 --> 00:09:42,249
I know where your rebel
guru Ramanuja is.

55
00:09:42,388 --> 00:09:45,357
I know how to trick Ramanuja into
coming out to the open.

56
00:09:45,558 --> 00:09:49,654
I know how cleverly the entire land
may be forced to worship only to Lord Shiva.

57
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:54,258
O, Lord Vishnu!

58
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:59,604
Did you notice how Lord Vishnu
makes you to chant his name, Kulothungan?

59
00:10:00,573 --> 00:10:02,404
My husband.
- Let him go.

60
00:10:02,608 --> 00:10:04,473
He was my childhood friend.

61
00:10:05,644 --> 00:10:08,414
His Vishnu culture makes war
only with words.

62
00:10:08,414 --> 00:10:12,111
My Shiva need not intercede.

63
00:10:12,218 --> 00:10:13,352
I am enough to make you sing
songs in His praise.

64
00:10:13,352 --> 00:10:15,621
Step aside and let that
idol of stone be buried in sea.

65
00:10:15,621 --> 00:10:18,424
Promise to speak only the name of Shiva.

66
00:10:18,424 --> 00:10:21,627
Accept Him as the Almighty.
None other.

67
00:10:21,627 --> 00:10:24,221
Your wife may be saved from
a widow's life.

68
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,397
Say it.

69
00:10:25,397 --> 00:10:28,367
What difference do names of Gods make?

70
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:30,198
Do not ruin my life.

71
00:10:30,336 --> 00:10:31,268
You are my Lord!

72
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,429
Obey the king.
He's the Lord of our world.

73
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:36,372
Just reduce the three words.
Say hail.

74
00:10:38,577 --> 00:10:40,568
Say it, please.

75
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,448
If I refuse to say means?

76
00:10:42,448 --> 00:10:44,211
You'll accompany that stone to the sea.

77
00:10:44,316 --> 00:10:45,613
And go to your disgraceful heaven.

78
00:10:46,252 --> 00:10:47,583
No place for traitors in my heaven.

79
00:10:48,187 --> 00:10:50,178
In my heaven
even the cursed are welcome.

80
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:51,657
Come and see for yourself.

81
00:10:51,657 --> 00:10:54,260
If not for my sake,
then for the sake of our son, please!

82
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,663
Say it, father.
For my sake, father.

83
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:54,379
Hail Lord Narayana,
Preserver of all Life.

84
00:17:04,376 --> 00:17:06,776
Rangarajan Nambi died not
by an act of Shiva.

85
00:17:07,346 --> 00:17:10,543
Nor is Vishnu to be blamed
for Nambi's death despite his faith.

86
00:17:10,649 --> 00:17:15,419
Stories abound of abandoned believers
in annals of both Theosophy and science.

87
00:17:15,554 --> 00:17:18,424
Today, science can be questioned.

88
00:17:18,424 --> 00:17:23,293
But the propaganda's first contention is
religion is unquestionable, infallible.

89
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:28,296
They vehemently insist there's a power
above all Accept it, know it as such.

90
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,765
Logically, if you stack up
forces of nature in ascending order...

91
00:17:32,404 --> 00:17:33,632
There's bound to be one on the very top

92
00:17:33,806 --> 00:17:34,795
For example,

93
00:17:35,307 --> 00:17:36,365
The satellite.

94
00:17:36,475 --> 00:17:39,672
Which right now roams the domain
of the gods.

95
00:17:39,778 --> 00:17:40,745
A super power.

96
00:17:40,879 --> 00:17:42,815
But this so-called superpower
that keeps an eye on the earth.

97
00:17:42,815 --> 00:17:45,716
And the Supreme Power that is credited
to have created the earth...

98
00:17:46,285 --> 00:17:49,618
Both failed to save the world
and my Tami Nadu in the hour of need.

99
00:17:49,722 --> 00:17:54,819
A truth the world knows.
For example, December 26, 2004.

100
00:17:55,294 --> 00:17:56,454
The sea outsmarted the roving eye
of god and satellite.

101
00:17:56,562 --> 00:17:58,530
And brought deluge and destruction
in the Bay of Bengal.

102
00:17:58,664 --> 00:18:02,430
But where's the connection between
my story and these facts?

103
00:18:02,735 --> 00:18:05,863
World history is a
progression of a series of events.

104
00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:10,470
The western world has a theory
called "The Chaos Theory".

105
00:18:10,576 --> 00:18:12,510
According to this scientific theory.

106
00:18:12,611 --> 00:18:16,411
A events in the world are co-related.

107
00:18:16,615 --> 00:18:17,707
Concurrent.

108
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,411
It connects the fluttering of
a butterfly wings...

109
00:18:21,754 --> 00:18:24,587
to an earthquake tremor.

110
00:18:25,391 --> 00:18:27,689
My story begin with a quake.

111
00:18:28,293 --> 00:18:30,557
And end with the flutter of a butterfly.

112
00:18:30,629 --> 00:18:32,529
You are our savior who rescued my child!

113
00:18:33,432 --> 00:18:35,366
If you are a man enough,

114
00:18:35,501 --> 00:18:37,366
touch his feet and beg for
his forgiveness.

115
00:18:37,636 --> 00:18:41,402
O, Lord Narayana, has my son
reached Your abode? Take me there too.

116
00:18:49,615 --> 00:18:51,674
Allah has saved us.

117
00:18:52,451 --> 00:18:54,612
From Allah we come.
unto Allah we return.

118
00:19:04,463 --> 00:19:07,489
Mr. Avtaar, you are safe now.

119
00:19:07,699 --> 00:19:08,688
Nothing is wrong with you now.

120
00:19:10,536 --> 00:19:12,561
Look, your relatives have come.

121
00:19:12,671 --> 00:19:14,764
Don't be afraid.
Turn and see.

122
00:19:15,607 --> 00:19:17,336
Come on, turn.
You can turn around.

123
00:19:34,326 --> 00:19:38,285
The second part of the story
begins in Washington D.C.

124
00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:40,287
And I, the narrator of this story,

125
00:19:40,365 --> 00:19:41,662
became an integral part
and protagonist of the story.

126
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:44,598
Like the fanatic king with his religion,
I was fascinated with my research.

127
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:47,500
Born in Tanjore, as Ramasamy Naiker son.

128
00:19:48,273 --> 00:19:49,706
Here I am, after a doctorate in biotech.

129
00:19:50,342 --> 00:19:53,607
Playing with micro organisms.

130
00:19:53,879 --> 00:19:59,374
Like me, many brilliant scientists
played the game of synthetic bio-weapons.

131
00:19:59,518 --> 00:20:03,614
Until fate intervened
on December 20, 2004.

132
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:06,485
America after September 11

133
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:10,521
was paranoid about defense against
bio-weapons.

134
00:20:11,563 --> 00:20:14,555
I, Govindarajan was a part of it.

135
00:20:41,095 --> 00:20:42,062
I will tell you in Tamil.

136
00:20:42,163 --> 00:20:47,396
The president is giving 1.3 billion dollars
for research on biological weapons.

137
00:21:02,216 --> 00:21:03,183
Sheila.

138
00:21:04,318 --> 00:21:06,218
Don't give chocolates for Hanu.

139
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,083
Nothing except apples,
Hanu.

140
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:18,023
You'll get worms.

141
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:23,898
Oh, not for you?
For your baby?

142
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,907
Don't give me that yarn.

143
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:33,447
Let's go, Govind.
- Ya, I'm coming.

144
00:24:12,973 --> 00:24:14,304
The equipment in there is worth millions.

145
00:24:16,243 --> 00:24:19,212
What's more important?
Dollars? Or our lives?

146
00:25:02,423 --> 00:25:04,288
Today a monkey,
Tomorrow a country might perish.

147
00:25:04,925 --> 00:25:06,127
A country, no less.

148
00:25:06,127 --> 00:25:08,322
Look Govind, these concerns.
- Didn't they occur to me before?

149
00:25:20,007 --> 00:25:24,103
Some silly scientist like me and a
clever runaway monkey like Hanu,

150
00:25:24,211 --> 00:25:27,271
caused the AIDS virus
that's rattling the world today.

151
00:25:30,117 --> 00:25:31,880
Our virus is worse.

152
00:25:35,322 --> 00:25:37,222
Why are you behaving like a unionist?

153
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:38,858
Think a bit.

154
00:25:39,193 --> 00:25:41,923
The venture capitalists will ask questions.

155
00:25:42,196 --> 00:25:43,230
What do I tell them?

156
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,892
Telling them is your job, not mine.

157
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,195
Okay. forget about your
current pay.

158
00:25:48,335 --> 00:25:49,927
How much more do you want?

159
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,128
I will make arrangements.

160
00:25:52,973 --> 00:25:53,997
How many millions you want?

161
00:25:55,009 --> 00:25:56,237
Even a hundred million.
- Okay.

162
00:25:58,379 --> 00:26:00,313
Not even for a hundred million
would get into your game.

163
00:26:01,182 --> 00:26:05,150
See me through till the end of it
and we'll put the money to good use.

164
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:07,387
They are businessman.
They'll do anything.

165
00:26:08,155 --> 00:26:09,417
Anything?
What do you mean?

166
00:26:09,523 --> 00:26:11,354
Like selling to terrorists.

167
00:26:12,393 --> 00:26:13,417
Would let that to happen?

168
00:26:13,928 --> 00:26:15,259
It's just the manner of speaking.

169
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:39,886
Where are you?

170
00:26:40,988 --> 00:26:43,957
I'm scared the way Dr. Sethu
is going about things.

171
00:26:44,258 --> 00:26:47,082
He's going to sell us out.

172
00:26:50,998 --> 00:26:52,124
He'd never do that.

173
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:53,331
Is your wife in the car?

174
00:26:53,434 --> 00:26:56,130
Yuka?
- Yes, Govind-san. I'm listening.

175
00:26:56,403 --> 00:27:00,100
I don't think he'd do that.
Even if he does what can we do?

176
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:02,201
I'll come to your place and tell.

177
00:27:02,943 --> 00:27:05,207
I'll ask Yuka to cook.
Stay for dinner.

178
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:37,985
Why can't it happen?

179
00:31:37,985 --> 00:31:38,952
It happened in the lab.

180
00:31:39,052 --> 00:31:40,144
We were able to contain it in
an enclosed environment.

181
00:31:40,487 --> 00:31:42,079
If it's released in the air.

182
00:31:42,389 --> 00:31:46,382
Millions will die. A nation can be
decimated. That's how dangerous it is.

183
00:31:46,527 --> 00:31:49,394
And Dr. Sethu has sold it!
- Sethu wouldn't do that.

184
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:52,158
He's a good man.
- Let him prove that to the FBI.

185
00:31:55,335 --> 00:31:57,961
It shouldn't become warm.
Where can we keep it?

186
00:31:58,438 --> 00:32:00,338
In the refrigerator.
- Good idea.

187
00:32:05,445 --> 00:32:09,404
Why, because it's a virus?
- No, to keep out moisture.

188
00:32:13,353 --> 00:32:16,156
Dinner will be ready.
- No thanks.

189
00:32:16,156 --> 00:32:17,088
Tension killed my appetite.

190
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:21,218
No matter what happens,
life must go on.

191
00:32:21,428 --> 00:32:23,919
Advice from a Hiroshima girl.

192
00:32:24,898 --> 00:32:26,388
Listen to me, brother.
- Okay, sister.

193
00:32:26,967 --> 00:32:29,094
Call the FBI.
- I'm checking the directory.

194
00:32:29,236 --> 00:32:30,260
Call them quickly.

195
00:32:38,345 --> 00:32:42,914
Dr. Sethu, he's insisting me
to call the FBI.

196
00:32:44,384 --> 00:32:46,011
No, I haven't.

197
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,457
No, he's inside with my wife.

198
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:00,064
Money?

199
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:01,395
How much money did
he pay you?

200
00:33:02,569 --> 00:33:03,297
Are you a man or what?

201
00:33:03,537 --> 00:33:05,402
Whatever I am.
I'm not a fool like you.

202
00:35:04,358 --> 00:35:05,416
Suresh.

203
00:36:40,085 --> 00:36:41,677
Shit.... Ram?

204
00:36:41,987 --> 00:36:44,854
Not Shit Ram, man.
Sail Ram, remember?

205
00:36:46,892 --> 00:36:50,089
Sweating in winter?
Jogging or drinking?

206
00:37:17,722 --> 00:37:19,121
Why are you reversing?

207
00:37:24,129 --> 00:37:25,118
Why are they chasing you?

208
00:37:26,097 --> 00:37:28,156
How does he find me wherever go?

209
00:37:28,767 --> 00:37:29,859
I ask you why, you ask me how?

210
00:37:31,836 --> 00:37:33,064
He's tracking me by my cell phone.

211
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,166
Why did you chuck it into that car?

212
00:37:36,741 --> 00:37:38,834
To set the Satan on his tail
You get me to the FBl.

213
00:37:39,044 --> 00:37:40,739
Hey! I'm no taxi, man....

214
00:37:40,845 --> 00:37:45,009
First, got to send all those parcels
by tonight's last flight to India.

215
00:37:45,116 --> 00:37:46,140
First courier, then only everything else.

216
00:37:47,852 --> 00:37:49,979
Okay, do whatever.
Go. go.

217
00:37:55,794 --> 00:37:56,886
Will you be back soon, please?

218
00:37:57,162 --> 00:37:58,220
Give me five minutes, okay.

219
00:39:00,759 --> 00:39:02,090
I don't like anyone fiddling
with my car.

220
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,158
First, get me to the FBI

221
00:39:07,766 --> 00:39:09,734
They'll buy you a brand new
whatever car you want.

222
00:39:11,302 --> 00:39:12,234
This packet....

223
00:39:14,873 --> 00:39:15,931
Hey, where's my packet?
Did you take it?

224
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:20,143
Look here.
I've mailed my five packets.

225
00:39:21,112 --> 00:39:22,841
Hey, ook.
It's right there.

226
00:39:23,715 --> 00:39:24,749
This is not mine.

227
00:39:24,749 --> 00:39:26,876
I don't know. whose?
- Hey. that's mine.

228
00:39:28,086 --> 00:39:28,984
How many packets did you send?

229
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,118
Five.

230
00:39:31,022 --> 00:39:32,046
Sorry, man.

231
00:39:32,924 --> 00:39:34,050
Grab it.

232
00:39:40,732 --> 00:39:42,723
India? Disaster.

233
00:42:56,996 --> 00:42:58,190
Father in heaven!

234
00:42:58,398 --> 00:42:59,387
Help!

235
00:43:03,169 --> 00:43:04,158
Spare me.

236
00:43:04,471 --> 00:43:07,065
I'll tell you Govind's whereabouts
here and in India.

237
00:43:07,407 --> 00:43:08,396
Even in Madras.

238
00:43:21,053 --> 00:43:23,406
Tokyo - Japan

239
00:43:51,351 --> 00:43:54,878
In Nikajo Osaki technique,
opponent's arm is beat to his side.

240
00:43:55,154 --> 00:43:57,054
And then behind him.

241
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:58,482
Lock the wrist and throw down.

242
00:43:59,092 --> 00:44:00,923
The opponent's arm is beat...

243
00:44:00,994 --> 00:44:03,087
into a key-lock.

244
00:44:03,396 --> 00:44:04,454
And thrown

245
00:44:04,998 --> 00:44:06,090
in Shomen Iminage technique,

246
00:44:06,266 --> 00:44:07,528
Let the opponent's power low past you.

247
00:44:07,934 --> 00:44:10,232
And throw him in a different
direction sideways.

248
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:11,664
In Sokurran Iminage,

249
00:44:11,905 --> 00:44:13,566
Chop him down with
your spread-out palm.

250
00:44:14,073 --> 00:44:16,371
In mni Tsuki, enter into
the opponent's place, catch his chin.

251
00:44:29,022 --> 00:44:30,080
Sadly.

252
00:44:30,189 --> 00:44:31,247
Your little sister....

253
00:44:31,925 --> 00:44:33,290
And her husband have been killed.

254
00:44:33,393 --> 00:44:35,020
She was wearing that medal
when she died.

255
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:38,422
Thank you very much.

256
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,387
How fluent are you in Tamil?

257
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:24,955
Can you see my body clearly?
- Very clear.

258
00:47:25,098 --> 00:47:28,158
My Tamil is clearer than this.

259
00:47:37,343 --> 00:47:41,006
He asks whether you'll do as told?
- Hey, know English too.

260
00:48:15,114 --> 00:48:16,282
What did he say?

261
00:48:16,282 --> 00:48:19,012
Told me to show you what
heaven is all about.

262
00:49:24,317 --> 00:49:26,080
See you in heaven.

263
00:51:18,873 --> 00:51:19,840
Don't talk to me
like an American policeman.

264
00:51:21,676 --> 00:51:27,615
Tell me as one Japanese to another.
Who did it?

265
00:51:27,949 --> 00:51:31,612
I was your student in Japan first.

266
00:51:32,687 --> 00:51:33,551
His name is

267
00:51:33,655 --> 00:51:35,816
Govind Ramasamy.
- Govind Ramasamy?

268
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,610
Ah, Apparao.

269
00:53:47,789 --> 00:53:49,780
Let it wait.
I'm at work.

270
00:53:58,166 --> 00:54:00,066
Balram Naidu. Research and Analysis Wing.

271
00:54:00,768 --> 00:54:02,633
Srinivasulu, sir.
Srinivasulu.

272
00:54:03,104 --> 00:54:04,002
Telugu?
- Yes, sir.

273
00:54:05,072 --> 00:54:06,699
Native village?
- Srikakulam.

274
00:54:08,676 --> 00:54:11,144
Srinivasulu, which container was he in?
- That one, sir.

275
00:54:18,085 --> 00:54:19,879
Master of Sciences.

276
00:54:22,056 --> 00:54:23,717
And then
a doctorate in Biology.

277
00:54:26,127 --> 00:54:27,924
You have a lot of degrees.

278
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:34,024
Are you a terrific scientist
or a scientific terrorist?

279
00:54:40,641 --> 00:54:43,610
Who put out the lights?
What's this, a nuptial night?

280
00:54:43,945 --> 00:54:44,912
On the lights!

281
00:54:45,813 --> 00:54:47,007
Like cinema lighting.

282
00:54:47,148 --> 00:54:49,048
How can I make out if a
criminal is lying?

283
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:50,674
I need to see the face.

284
00:54:50,785 --> 00:54:51,615
That's it!

285
00:54:53,855 --> 00:54:56,688
Tanjore.
That makes you a Tamilan.

286
00:55:04,165 --> 00:55:09,728
What is India's largest spoken language?
Hindi.

287
00:55:11,138 --> 00:55:13,072
Do you know the second largest?
- Tamil.

288
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:19,610
Telugu Tamil is only the third
am a Telugu.

289
00:55:19,981 --> 00:55:24,577
Was deputed to Tamil Nadu.
I learnt Tamil and I speak fluently.

290
00:55:24,785 --> 00:55:27,049
But you're from Tanjore,
speak English?

291
00:55:27,588 --> 00:55:28,823
How will Tamil survive then?

292
00:55:28,823 --> 00:55:30,882
Some Telugu's like you will rescue it.

293
00:55:32,026 --> 00:55:37,862
Look... I want to talk to someone of
higher rank... a higher official.

294
00:55:38,633 --> 00:55:39,895
A patron of Tamil is nice,
but at the same time one must know ...

295
00:55:40,768 --> 00:55:41,962
At least a spattering of science.

296
00:55:42,637 --> 00:55:45,731
How about telephoning the President?

297
00:55:46,741 --> 00:55:48,140
Son of a scientist!

298
00:55:48,609 --> 00:55:51,908
I'm the highest here.
Anything higher and you'll be in heaven.

299
00:55:57,151 --> 00:55:58,982
Are you the leader of this gang?

300
00:55:59,854 --> 00:56:01,879
Or are you working for any other agency?

301
00:56:01,989 --> 00:56:05,584
Which agency?
Lashkar-e-Toiba?

302
00:56:06,027 --> 00:56:08,052
Al- Qaeda or ULFA?

303
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:10,955
Do you know what Hydrebadi Pill is?

304
00:56:12,066 --> 00:56:13,055
I will explain.

305
00:56:13,968 --> 00:56:18,606
The standard-size police baton
is inserted into your body

306
00:56:18,606 --> 00:56:21,507
till only six inches of it
is sticking out.

307
00:56:22,009 --> 00:56:24,671
They always strike the stick
with every question.

308
00:56:24,779 --> 00:56:27,839
And everything is purged out.
Including the truth.

309
00:56:30,818 --> 00:56:35,721
If you're stubborn, I'll shoot you
andâ€™ll say that you tried to escape.

310
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,920
Brother, your ball is in my court.

311
00:56:45,666 --> 00:56:49,966
One kick and out comes your orange-sized
hydrocele in surgery. What you say?

312
00:56:52,673 --> 00:56:53,571
Iâ€™ll tell you the truth.

313
00:56:54,642 --> 00:56:57,076
That parcel contains a dangerous substance.
- I know that.

314
00:56:57,845 --> 00:57:03,044
Synthetic biotechnology. A small vial
that could kill us. Am I Right?

315
00:57:05,152 --> 00:57:08,679
That's exactly why need to
talk to a scientist, not a policeman.

316
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:11,858
It shouldn't get too hot
or too cold.

317
00:57:13,661 --> 00:57:17,995
Like some mystical hybrid creature?
Neither this nor that?

318
00:57:21,135 --> 00:57:22,602
Shall tell you?

319
00:57:22,937 --> 00:57:23,961
That vial.

320
00:57:26,073 --> 00:57:28,906
Is not in the container
that you came in.

321
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:31,578
Sir, the vial is not in that container.

322
00:57:33,047 --> 00:57:36,039
My point too!
Are you translating my words to me?

323
00:57:36,617 --> 00:57:38,676
No vial in the container.
It was searched.

324
00:57:38,919 --> 00:57:40,654
Your body was searched too.
No vial found.

325
00:57:40,654 --> 00:57:44,954
Thought you've swallowed it, but no
because it's a virus and if you did,

326
00:57:45,159 --> 00:57:47,889
then at least, you'd have diarrhea.
But no.

327
00:57:49,864 --> 00:57:52,765
I want answers.
Pat. pat, pat.

328
00:57:56,937 --> 00:57:57,904
Come in.

329
00:57:59,073 --> 00:58:02,643
Who's that?
Come in.... is that Apparao?

330
00:58:02,643 --> 00:58:04,702
Yes, sir.
- Come.

331
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:09,947
From America.

332
00:58:14,855 --> 00:58:18,882
Just say it.
- Two FBI officers have come from America.

333
00:58:18,993 --> 00:58:20,483
What do you want me to do?

334
00:58:20,628 --> 00:58:22,619
They are in a rush.
- Show them the toilet.

335
00:58:22,897 --> 00:58:25,866
Not that...
- Say I'm busy with investigations.

336
00:58:26,767 --> 00:58:30,567
These foreigners you welcome them,
give them garlands.

337
00:58:31,772 --> 00:58:34,707
Give them coconuts with a straw to sip
and leave them sit on the vip lounge.

338
00:58:34,809 --> 00:58:36,640
Do I have to tell you everything? Do it!
- Understood. sir

339
00:58:59,066 --> 00:59:00,795
It's urgent. I'll be downstairs.

340
00:59:01,802 --> 00:59:04,862
Meanwhile if he's thirsty,
don't give him water.

341
00:59:05,139 --> 00:59:06,697
In India, guests are treated like gods.

342
00:59:06,807 --> 00:59:10,573
The bosses in Delhi tell me to pay tribute
to the white guests. I'll be back.

343
00:59:12,012 --> 00:59:14,037
I want to talk to him.
- To whom?

344
00:59:14,181 --> 00:59:17,844
The one on the phone your boss.

345
00:59:19,053 --> 00:59:22,682
Silly boy, I'm far better.
That man is a turbaned Sikh.

346
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:25,859
In his turban, he carries long pins.
He'll ask you pointed questions.

347
00:59:25,993 --> 00:59:28,518
At least, the FBI agents?
- Yes, the Americans are coming.

348
00:59:28,729 --> 00:59:31,562
The American Pill!
When they hit the end of the stick,

349
00:59:31,699 --> 00:59:33,894
I'll like to hear which language
you'll scream in.

350
00:59:46,046 --> 00:59:50,881
VIP guests for Mr. Balram Naidu...
- He went to the VIP lounge to meet them.

351
00:59:51,585 --> 00:59:53,883
I've brought his guests here.
Let them wait here.

352
01:00:07,635 --> 01:00:08,795
Sir, look! There.

353
01:00:12,973 --> 01:00:14,804
Oh shit! Guard.
- Sit down.

354
01:00:26,187 --> 01:00:27,620
Don't. Inspector.

355
01:00:30,057 --> 01:00:31,854
But it's enough to blow your brains.

356
01:00:32,993 --> 01:00:34,984
Want your brains splattered all over us?

357
01:00:49,677 --> 01:00:51,008
Here is the lady's gun.

358
01:00:59,887 --> 01:01:03,084
Don't lie - put it in a different
box to keep it cool.

359
01:01:03,791 --> 01:01:05,816
By now, it's on its way
to another destination.

360
01:01:09,697 --> 01:01:12,962
Tell me where? Else ...
- What? Will you kill me?

361
01:01:29,817 --> 01:01:31,652
Do you have a family
and children?

362
01:01:31,652 --> 01:01:33,552
Two boys.

363
01:02:13,418 --> 01:02:15,443
Apparao, have the coconut taken away.

364
01:02:15,553 --> 01:02:16,520
Yes, sir.

365
01:02:38,476 --> 01:02:39,644
Only you are allowed.

366
01:02:39,644 --> 01:02:41,373
They must exit via immigration.

367
01:02:42,447 --> 01:02:44,347
They are from America.
FBI agents.

368
01:02:45,216 --> 01:02:46,183
But two agents just went out.

369
01:02:47,218 --> 01:02:50,346
These are the others.
- need permission from superiors.

370
01:02:53,524 --> 01:02:54,759
Gurvinder, stand here.

371
01:02:54,759 --> 01:02:57,193
I'll go and ask the boss.
- A right.

372
01:03:23,121 --> 01:03:25,453
Big crowd.
I'll fetch the luggage.

373
01:03:26,357 --> 01:03:27,551
Hang on.

374
01:03:28,192 --> 01:03:31,161
Mom, tell dad to fetch the luggage.
- All right.

375
01:03:32,497 --> 01:03:35,364
Photos, please?
- Photos? As many as you want.

376
01:03:37,302 --> 01:03:38,326
You can ask me in Tamil.

377
01:03:38,603 --> 01:03:41,629
You still remember Tamil?
- How can forget?

378
01:03:43,207 --> 01:03:45,607
From this soil, I sprung
Tamil Nadu, I can't forget.

379
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:49,338
However high I climb in life,
won't forget.

380
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:52,515
For me, this is a temple. Home of
60 million gods, who inhabit this soil.

381
01:03:53,484 --> 01:03:54,473
Even she has not forgotten Tamil.

382
01:03:54,652 --> 01:03:57,416
True, haven't.

383
01:03:58,423 --> 01:04:00,391
But if I keep talking to you.

384
01:04:00,758 --> 01:04:02,191
I will forget my luggage.

385
01:04:02,427 --> 01:04:03,553
See! She's joking in Tamil as well.

386
01:04:10,401 --> 01:04:11,629
Lets go outside.

387
01:04:13,671 --> 01:04:15,639
A huge amount of money has been spent.

388
01:04:15,707 --> 01:04:16,696
A tickets are sold out.

389
01:04:17,208 --> 01:04:19,073
Will you sing in Tamil. Hindi or Punjabi?

390
01:04:20,645 --> 01:04:22,579
I'll sing in any language that
my fans like.

391
01:04:22,714 --> 01:04:24,238
You're coughing badly.
How will you sing?

392
01:04:24,349 --> 01:04:26,340
Don't worry.
Just a day or two...

393
01:04:26,451 --> 01:04:29,318
Blood... goodness, he's bleeding.
What happened?

394
01:04:31,589 --> 01:04:32,351
Ranjita.

395
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:41,359
Move aside... move.

396
01:04:41,632 --> 01:04:42,599
God!

397
01:04:45,403 --> 01:04:48,304
Say something?
- God help me.

398
01:04:49,574 --> 01:04:52,270
Don't let them in.
Please keep an eye for a while.

399
01:05:08,593 --> 01:05:10,527
Someone call a doctor.

400
01:05:11,295 --> 01:05:13,627
Careful, careful with him.

401
01:05:30,481 --> 01:05:32,415
Inspectors, you got a phone?

402
01:05:50,268 --> 01:05:51,257
Where are we now?

403
01:05:51,636 --> 01:05:53,365
On the Chengalpet Bridge.

404
01:06:41,552 --> 01:06:43,076
Good, what's the address?

405
01:06:43,187 --> 01:06:44,677
First, take him to the hospital.

406
01:07:09,413 --> 01:07:12,541
The inspector is wounded.
Take him to the hospital.

407
01:07:12,683 --> 01:07:14,617
I have a deadline.
I'll be late then.

408
01:07:15,286 --> 01:07:17,151
If he doesn't go to the hospital,
you'll go to the jail.

409
01:07:17,355 --> 01:07:18,652
He's a police inspector.
- Okay, get in.

410
01:07:30,368 --> 01:07:31,528
Drive.

411
01:09:06,664 --> 01:09:08,222
Apparao.
- Yes?

412
01:09:08,366 --> 01:09:12,427
That vial isn't in the container.
And they are leaving Why?

413
01:09:12,603 --> 01:09:16,699
I suppose Govind, the gang leader,
put the vial some where else.

414
01:09:17,708 --> 01:09:21,041
Get the courier on phone.
Get their dispatch lists.

415
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:44,100
A foreigner and a lady came here.

416
01:09:44,235 --> 01:09:47,471
Only a foreigner?
No Govind?

417
01:09:47,471 --> 01:09:49,632
Who's Govind?
- You don't need to know.

418
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:51,105
Tell me what else had happened?

419
01:09:51,242 --> 01:09:53,710
They barged in all of a sudden,
destroyed everything and left.

420
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:00,348
Then, what happened?
- They asked for the list of dispatches.

421
01:10:00,518 --> 01:10:02,645
And you gave it?
- Didn't. They took it.

422
01:10:06,223 --> 01:10:10,523
Then?
- They smashed the hard discs and left.

423
01:10:26,844 --> 01:10:30,712
I have a duplicate dispatch lists
which I've been trying to give you.

424
01:10:34,418 --> 01:10:35,442
Who is this boy?

425
01:10:38,222 --> 01:10:39,519
Name?
- Narasimha Rao.

426
01:10:41,592 --> 01:10:43,389
Telugu?
- No sir, Kannada.

427
01:10:45,596 --> 01:10:48,565
No problem!
Both languages use a similar script.

428
01:10:50,801 --> 01:10:53,736
Narasimha Rao, how many dispatches
here been made out of this list?

429
01:10:54,338 --> 01:10:57,508
Nearly 200.
- Can we raise 200 policemen?

430
01:10:57,508 --> 01:11:00,478
Tough. The prime minister is visiting.
- Well, we'll make do.

431
01:11:00,478 --> 01:11:02,708
Put a man on each address for surveillance.

432
01:11:03,447 --> 01:11:07,679
Narasimha Rao and Apparao,
you must co-operate round the clock.

433
01:11:07,785 --> 01:11:11,915
Even the CIA is co-operating with RAW.
What more is needed? They mustn't escape.

434
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:17,951
A newspapers must carry their photos.
Their reputation should be ruined.

435
01:11:19,597 --> 01:11:22,361
They just can't cruise around Tamil Nadu.

436
01:15:13,631 --> 01:15:15,633
Tell Grandma to come, please.
- Please wait.

437
01:15:15,633 --> 01:15:17,801
That's my parcel.
- It's for Grandma.

438
01:15:17,801 --> 01:15:19,666
No, I mailed it to myself.
- Are you Grandma?

439
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,191
Grandma, come here.

440
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:55,304
There's a parcel for you by courier.

441
01:15:55,406 --> 01:15:56,532
For me? Come on.

442
01:15:57,408 --> 01:15:58,773
Has he sent me a parcel?

443
01:16:00,744 --> 01:16:04,314
Must be Aravarnudan?
- Careful.

444
01:16:04,314 --> 01:16:06,248
Krishnaveni, parcel for you.
- I know.

445
01:16:07,618 --> 01:16:11,213
Watch your step.
- I know.

446
01:16:15,492 --> 01:16:18,188
Give it.
- Who's this? Another son?

447
01:16:18,362 --> 01:16:20,193
Another son.
- No! She has only one son.

448
01:16:20,364 --> 01:16:22,662
But this is coming from a different place.

449
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:24,289
He travels all over.
- She's nuts.

450
01:16:24,401 --> 01:16:26,301
Oh, I see.
Please sign.

451
01:16:26,603 --> 01:16:28,127
Grandma's thumb sign.

452
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:32,103
Give.
- Here.

453
01:16:32,476 --> 01:16:33,443
Ask her.

454
01:16:41,685 --> 01:16:45,348
Hey courier... over here.
What was that guy asking?

455
01:16:45,489 --> 01:16:47,758
Who are you to ask that?
- Police intelligence.

456
01:16:47,758 --> 01:16:48,690
Come that side.

457
01:16:49,626 --> 01:16:52,424
Hey! Not with a cop looking on
Zip up, man.

458
01:16:52,563 --> 01:16:54,690
They make me work the yuckiest holes.

459
01:16:56,567 --> 01:16:57,693
There you go.

460
01:16:57,801 --> 01:16:59,564
Have you spotted the guy?
Is he the one?

461
01:17:00,471 --> 01:17:02,371
Same as the one in the photo, sir.

462
01:17:02,573 --> 01:17:04,234
He asked the courier about a parcel.

463
01:17:04,341 --> 01:17:07,139
But an old lady took the parcel.

464
01:17:07,244 --> 01:17:09,405
Now he's fighting with another man
who just stepped out.

465
01:17:09,513 --> 01:17:11,378
They just made up and
went inside.

466
01:17:11,515 --> 01:17:14,318
Don't let him out of your sight.
Stay right there.

467
01:17:14,318 --> 01:17:16,309
Do you have a back-up support?

468
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:19,480
Only the courier boy.
He's a raw hand.

469
01:17:19,690 --> 01:17:21,248
But I'm a family man, sir.

470
01:17:21,358 --> 01:17:23,193
My sister is getting marry next month.

471
01:17:23,193 --> 01:17:25,184
I've sent you an invitation, sir.

472
01:17:25,362 --> 01:17:26,727
He's an international terrorist.

473
01:17:27,131 --> 01:17:30,692
Please send a police force.
I'm a one and unarmed.

474
01:17:31,135 --> 01:17:34,161
Who's this man?
- Local police, sir.

475
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:38,438
How can you be afraid?
You're a policeman, right?

476
01:17:38,542 --> 01:17:42,501
A huge force is coming. Be brave.
Above all, I'm coming.

477
01:17:42,713 --> 01:17:44,510
Is that all, sir?
Over, sir?

478
01:17:44,648 --> 01:17:47,674
Check the parcel, then give it to me.

479
01:17:47,785 --> 01:17:49,082
Otherwise, give it to the police.

480
01:17:49,253 --> 01:17:51,388
Anda ...Anda ....
- What is it now?

481
01:17:51,388 --> 01:17:53,549
Krishnaveni got upset and locked
herself in again.

482
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:56,158
How many locks will we break?

483
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:57,557
Which Krishnaveni?
- The one who took your parcel.

484
01:17:58,228 --> 01:18:00,093
What happened to her?
- She lost her mind.

485
01:18:00,664 --> 01:18:03,400
Because of the parcel
- No, long before we were born.

486
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,368
She's in the closet.
- I know.

487
01:18:05,469 --> 01:18:08,097
Her son went abroad to study
and died. Since then.

488
01:18:08,405 --> 01:18:09,531
Since when?

489
01:18:09,773 --> 01:18:11,408
I wasn't even born.
- My point.

490
01:18:11,408 --> 01:18:13,377
She thinks her son is alive.
Thanks to friends in US.

491
01:18:13,377 --> 01:18:15,368
They send medicines for her.

492
01:18:17,214 --> 01:18:18,112
What the hell is this?

493
01:18:20,751 --> 01:18:22,150
Wait, just wait.

494
01:18:24,755 --> 01:18:28,316
Grandma Krishna.... I'm Andal.

495
01:18:29,493 --> 01:18:31,195
Can you come out?

496
01:18:31,195 --> 01:18:33,530
Can't. This is my parcel.

497
01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:35,691
Where is that goddamned man?

498
01:18:36,133 --> 01:18:39,125
There are so many.... goddamned people here.

499
01:18:39,503 --> 01:18:40,370
Must be me.
- Oh.

500
01:18:40,370 --> 01:18:42,304
The one behind the parcel?
- No, came with it.

501
01:18:42,372 --> 01:18:43,134
He is here.

502
01:18:43,307 --> 01:18:47,243
He doesn't want the whole parcel.
Only something inside it.

503
01:18:47,377 --> 01:18:49,675
The police has been informed.
Nothing to be afraid of. Come out.

504
01:18:49,813 --> 01:18:53,579
Ok, I'm coming.
It isn't comfortable in the closet.

505
01:18:53,717 --> 01:18:57,084
What's your name, boy?

506
01:18:57,221 --> 01:19:01,123
Goodness!
- That's hardly a name.

507
01:19:02,192 --> 01:19:04,285
Is this yours?
- Yes, yes.

508
01:19:04,394 --> 01:19:05,383
Grandma, give it to me, please.

509
01:19:05,562 --> 01:19:09,225
But what is this?
- This thing, I can't quite speak about.

510
01:19:09,733 --> 01:19:12,702
The unspeakable?
Like a girl missing her charms?

511
01:19:13,637 --> 01:19:14,695
Grandma! Don't open it.

512
01:19:21,345 --> 01:19:23,280
Did you get it?

513
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:27,478
Neither did I.
But it resembles chocolate.

514
01:19:27,684 --> 01:19:30,152
It's a virus. Flit gets out,
everyone will die.

515
01:19:30,254 --> 01:19:32,222
Don't be scared.
We'll all die anyway.

516
01:19:32,356 --> 01:19:34,381
But we'll die now if it gets out.

517
01:19:35,525 --> 01:19:37,652
No. no.
Not the exploding type.

518
01:19:38,161 --> 01:19:40,095
Only, it must never leak.

519
01:19:53,410 --> 01:19:56,713
He said his name is Govind.
But he looks like a terrorist.

520
01:19:56,713 --> 01:19:59,273
Brother, I'm leaving.
- Stop, the inquiry isn't over yet.

521
01:19:59,383 --> 01:20:02,409
An international terrorist is with Govind.

522
01:20:02,519 --> 01:20:05,420
Look! These photos
will be in the papers tomorrow.

523
01:20:05,522 --> 01:20:07,683
There will be more.
- What?

524
01:20:08,225 --> 01:20:13,754
The policeman who found the terrorist
and the courier who helped him.

525
01:20:14,531 --> 01:20:16,366
You will be in the news
and you want to leave.

526
01:20:16,366 --> 01:20:20,462
Where is the monastery?
- There.

527
01:20:20,570 --> 01:20:22,595
Did she ask you?

528
01:20:22,739 --> 01:20:25,264
It's over there
but why are you going there?

529
01:20:25,409 --> 01:20:29,179
To pray.
- Wait, you can't go there now.

530
01:20:29,179 --> 01:20:30,771
Why?
The prayers are called off?

531
01:20:31,181 --> 01:20:34,378
I'm not supposed to tell.
We're busy. Please go.

532
01:20:34,484 --> 01:20:36,384
Please listen to him.
He is an intelligence policeman.

533
01:20:36,486 --> 01:20:38,716
Govind is inside.
He's a dreaded terrorist.

534
01:20:38,822 --> 01:20:41,723
You are interfering with surveillance.
Go away, please.

535
01:20:42,326 --> 01:20:47,161
Aren't there others on surveillance?
- He's a one man army!

536
01:20:47,464 --> 01:20:51,833
His sister is marrying next month and
I'm Prabhu And he isn't even armed.

537
01:20:52,402 --> 01:20:54,597
There's one man behind the house
And the entire battalion is coming.

538
01:20:55,238 --> 01:20:58,173
Have you any more to tell?
Are you my publicist?

539
01:20:58,308 --> 01:20:59,434
Madam, please leave us.

540
01:20:59,543 --> 01:21:01,244
Come back for prayers later.

541
01:21:01,244 --> 01:21:02,643
Your wife name is Mary?

542
01:21:02,779 --> 01:21:04,406
How come you know Mary?

543
01:21:04,514 --> 01:21:06,243
The tattoo on your arm.

544
01:21:06,316 --> 01:21:10,412
Oh, this was when I was young.
My wife's name now is Laxmi.

545
01:21:10,687 --> 01:21:12,245
Then, Mary is your girlfriend?

546
01:21:12,356 --> 01:21:13,846
Don't ask embarrassing questions.

547
01:21:14,191 --> 01:21:14,816
Mary isn't your wife?

548
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:16,255
No.

549
01:21:16,393 --> 01:21:20,261
Even, I did it on my body.
Now, can't remove it. Look.

550
01:22:01,338 --> 01:22:02,472
Give it, Grandma.

551
01:22:02,472 --> 01:22:04,770
Wash your hands with antiseptic.
It's a virus.

552
01:22:04,875 --> 01:22:08,436
I shall first ask God.

553
01:22:08,578 --> 01:22:09,446
You wait here.

554
01:22:09,446 --> 01:22:12,472
What which god?
- Out of my way.

555
01:22:13,383 --> 01:22:14,475
Move.

556
01:22:14,684 --> 01:22:16,820
Mad cow.
- What was that?

557
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:19,254
Nothing. I said I go to your God.
- Only after you.

558
01:22:24,793 --> 01:22:26,852
God wait, don't go away.

559
01:22:29,064 --> 01:22:31,692
This thing listen.

560
01:22:32,568 --> 01:22:35,604
Grandma, go inside. You'll fall
- Want to go to the God.

561
01:22:35,604 --> 01:22:38,767
If you fall down, you'll go to Him.
- I'm going to him.

562
01:22:45,814 --> 01:22:47,179
Lord, You know what this is?
- Grandma, come back!

563
01:22:47,549 --> 01:22:49,779
What are you?
- Sorry.

564
01:22:49,985 --> 01:22:54,615
Govindaraja, this is some germ bomb.

565
01:22:54,756 --> 01:22:58,692
You're the Saviour.
Keep this with you.

566
01:23:00,662 --> 01:23:04,120
Don't fall down and break something.
Get down from there.

567
01:23:08,937 --> 01:23:11,770
Mind that box!
- Don't drop me.

568
01:23:16,078 --> 01:23:16,976
Bless you all.

569
01:23:18,247 --> 01:23:23,913
Heavy traffic, so took the fly-over.
- Stop joking! Where's the vial?

570
01:23:26,989 --> 01:23:28,684
How could you lose it?

571
01:23:29,858 --> 01:23:34,090
I didn't lose it. I give it to God.
- To that God?

572
01:23:35,731 --> 01:23:37,995
And He'll give...
- This god?

573
01:23:38,133 --> 01:23:39,100
For safe-keeping.
- Goodness!

574
01:23:39,201 --> 01:23:40,998
One minute.
- It's inside Him.

575
01:23:45,607 --> 01:23:47,973
What why do you stop us?
- What do you want?

576
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:50,045
Wait please....
- Don't stand before God wearing shoe.

577
01:23:50,045 --> 01:23:52,946
A vial is inside it. The chip is inside!
- No fields or values in this town.

578
01:23:53,181 --> 01:23:55,183
Don't disturb go away.
- Not values... A vial.

579
01:23:55,183 --> 01:23:57,151
Go and sit in your place.

580
01:24:10,599 --> 01:24:12,863
Is the suspect Govind in that area?

581
01:24:15,137 --> 01:24:19,938
Narayana... good God.
Who's throwing stones?

582
01:24:20,709 --> 01:24:24,543
Press the button and talk
Is Govind there or not?

583
01:24:25,681 --> 01:24:30,846
Bullshit! You're the idiot.
Govind went in search of God.

584
01:24:31,587 --> 01:24:37,082
What's this like a swollen cell phone?
- What's a swollen?

585
01:24:39,695 --> 01:24:41,788
Why hasn't the monastery come yet?
- We're coming to it.

586
01:24:42,164 --> 01:24:43,654
Put it away.

587
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:53,764
Ekambaram, where are you?

588
01:24:56,712 --> 01:24:58,111
No need to panic.

589
01:24:58,814 --> 01:25:00,748
There is a terrorist in your midst.

590
01:25:01,049 --> 01:25:04,075
Everybody stands still
until arrest him.

591
01:25:04,953 --> 01:25:07,547
What, mister?
Hey, Govind!

592
01:25:07,956 --> 01:25:11,949
You and your assistants.
Christian Fletcher and the girl.

593
01:25:12,227 --> 01:25:13,592
Surrender at once.

594
01:25:13,962 --> 01:25:15,156
By the count of ten.

595
01:25:15,831 --> 01:25:16,957
One.

596
01:25:19,835 --> 01:25:20,665
Two.

597
01:25:23,238 --> 01:25:24,136
Goodness, God!

598
01:25:50,832 --> 01:25:51,958
My God!

599
01:25:56,171 --> 01:25:56,967
Good God!

600
01:26:26,668 --> 01:26:27,896
My head is spinning.

601
01:27:38,907 --> 01:27:41,603
Where are we taking the bus to?
- Who knows?

602
01:27:41,977 --> 01:27:44,172
Slow down.

603
01:27:44,513 --> 01:27:47,107
Not in my hands.
- The bus is. Let go.

604
01:27:47,249 --> 01:27:48,617
Let go?

605
01:27:48,617 --> 01:27:49,811
Yes!

606
01:27:50,886 --> 01:27:51,750
Let go of it!

607
01:27:57,125 --> 01:27:58,592
Don't scream into my ears.

608
01:28:14,142 --> 01:28:15,837
Open your eyes and get in.

609
01:28:16,611 --> 01:28:17,873
Look at what you're getting into.

610
01:28:19,881 --> 01:28:22,551
I've never even gotten into a moving bus.

611
01:28:22,551 --> 01:28:24,553
Astrologically, water is dangerous for me.

612
01:28:24,553 --> 01:28:25,747
This is train not water.

613
01:28:26,521 --> 01:28:27,923
There must be water in the train?

614
01:28:27,923 --> 01:28:31,586
What are you talking?
- What if we come to a bridge over train?

615
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:33,589
Get in before it comes.

616
01:28:36,665 --> 01:28:37,757
Give me the God.

617
01:28:39,201 --> 01:28:40,725
Why did you steal my God?

618
01:28:44,673 --> 01:28:48,677
I didn't steal. I'm trying
to save everyone, including you.

619
01:28:48,677 --> 01:28:50,011
Savior of Gods!
Look at you.

620
01:28:50,011 --> 01:28:51,911
The policeman said that
you're a terrorist.

621
01:28:52,013 --> 01:28:56,084
What do you mean?
- An extremist, terrorist.

622
01:28:56,084 --> 01:28:57,711
I'm no terrorist.
Swear by you.

623
01:28:58,153 --> 01:28:59,085
Don't touch me.

624
01:29:00,055 --> 01:29:01,957
Okay, swear by your god.
- Don't touch the idol!

625
01:29:01,957 --> 01:29:03,925
Who knows what caste you are?
What is your dad's name?

626
01:29:04,125 --> 01:29:05,524
Why now?

627
01:29:05,894 --> 01:29:08,863
Okay, Ramasamy.
- O.K. Ramasamy?

628
01:29:09,030 --> 01:29:11,897
Not O.K. Just Ramasamy Naicker.

629
01:29:12,968 --> 01:29:15,604
Oh, the atheist?
Don't come near me! Keep away!

630
01:29:15,604 --> 01:29:19,472
My dad wasn't an atheist.
Just an artiste.

631
01:29:19,574 --> 01:29:22,873
Artiste?
- Musician. A renowned musician.

632
01:29:23,011 --> 01:29:26,708
Good. But you're getting too close.
Go.

633
01:29:27,782 --> 01:29:30,842
Your god thinks that stinking toilet
is holier than me?

634
01:29:33,488 --> 01:29:36,480
Why didn't you tell me
there's a sauchalayam?

635
01:29:36,658 --> 01:29:38,819
Sauchalayam?
- Toilet.

636
01:29:40,929 --> 01:29:43,098
Bathroom! That's a room as well.
Use it.

637
01:29:43,098 --> 01:29:45,896
Don't mock God.
Isn't the vial inside?

638
01:29:46,034 --> 01:29:48,832
The sower shall be made to cheap.
- This time, it'll be the grim reaper.

639
01:29:48,970 --> 01:29:51,097
So. I'm telling you to
give me the vial.

640
01:29:51,773 --> 01:29:52,637
Don't shake!

641
01:29:52,741 --> 01:29:54,902
Remove it carefully with your finger.
- Can't do it with finger.

642
01:29:55,777 --> 01:29:57,711
Then, lets find an axe.

643
01:29:57,812 --> 01:30:01,578
You wretch!
You think he's timber?

644
01:30:01,683 --> 01:30:02,775
He's Lord Govindaraja.

645
01:30:03,551 --> 01:30:04,540
He is my God!

646
01:30:05,053 --> 01:30:07,749
Exactly! He is God!
- Not him.

647
01:30:09,190 --> 01:30:10,555
The train is slowing down.

648
01:30:10,792 --> 01:30:12,919
Let's get off.
- In motion?

649
01:30:13,028 --> 01:30:16,798
With the idol? Never.
- You say no to everything.

650
01:30:16,798 --> 01:30:18,993
What do you want me to do?
The white guy will kill us.

651
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:21,034
Which white guy?
- Take a look.

652
01:30:22,804 --> 01:30:24,795
That jeep.

653
01:30:26,942 --> 01:30:27,874
God! Let go.

654
01:30:30,779 --> 01:30:31,711
What happened?

655
01:30:31,813 --> 01:30:33,007
That's my God!

656
01:31:02,677 --> 01:31:04,975
Lord Govindaraja, forgive me.
- Okay, you're forgiven.

657
01:31:06,982 --> 01:31:08,609
Give it.
-  Won't!

658
01:31:10,085 --> 01:31:11,712
I won't give.
- Let me.

659
01:31:12,020 --> 01:31:12,884
Give it, please.

660
01:31:14,222 --> 01:31:15,621
Stop!

661
01:31:15,724 --> 01:31:17,658
If you touch me or my God.

662
01:31:17,792 --> 01:31:20,158
I'm not interested in touching you.
I want the stuff inside.

663
01:31:21,596 --> 01:31:22,927
And a rapist too?
- What?

664
01:31:23,698 --> 01:31:26,758
Our God, Protector of women
will protect me.

665
01:31:27,135 --> 01:31:27,965
Watch it.

666
01:31:28,570 --> 01:31:29,738
Look....

667
01:31:29,738 --> 01:31:30,762
There's light.

668
01:31:30,939 --> 01:31:32,099
A farmer's hearth.

669
01:31:32,207 --> 01:31:36,507
Do you know what a farmer is. A toiler,
with a tough body.

670
01:31:36,678 --> 01:31:37,879
He'll fix you!

671
01:31:37,879 --> 01:31:39,642
Brother, help!

672
01:31:41,916 --> 01:31:43,577
Get out!
- I'm a ready out in the open.

673
01:31:43,818 --> 01:31:46,116
Farmer, help!

674
01:31:48,990 --> 01:31:52,585
There is your tough body
but I'm sure if it's a farmer.

675
01:31:52,761 --> 01:31:55,559
Stop, you'll scare yourself.
- I'm not scared.

676
01:32:00,268 --> 01:32:03,135
Did they burn him alive? He is trying
to stand up. What on earth is it?

677
01:32:04,773 --> 01:32:07,208
A half-burnt corpse tends to jerk.
- Jerk?

678
01:32:07,208 --> 01:32:08,573
Due to heat.

679
01:32:10,211 --> 01:32:11,178
The idol should not be here.

680
01:32:11,613 --> 01:32:14,115
Oh yes, it's an unholy place.
- No. It's the heat.

681
01:32:14,115 --> 01:32:16,640
The vial inside...
- Oh! Yes, let's go.

682
01:32:17,218 --> 01:32:18,879
Will you please demount and walk?

683
01:32:21,156 --> 01:32:22,851
How dare you carry me!
- What?

684
01:32:23,925 --> 01:32:25,017
I mean the idol.

685
01:32:28,129 --> 01:32:29,926
Come along!
For safety sake.

686
01:32:33,968 --> 01:32:37,172
It become so dark suddenly?
- The earth is rotating, you see.

687
01:32:37,172 --> 01:32:38,662
Watch your step.

688
01:32:43,812 --> 01:32:44,938
What are you up to?

689
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:47,105
Oh. It's wet here.

690
01:32:47,282 --> 01:32:51,309
What have you done?
- I did nothing. The sand is wet.

691
01:32:51,553 --> 01:32:52,320
I can put the idol in here.

692
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,117
Not in wet sand?

693
01:32:54,289 --> 01:32:56,314
Heâ€™ll catch a fever?
Don't be silly.

694
01:32:56,591 --> 01:32:58,183
Silly you!
Burying a watch in the sand.

695
01:33:03,565 --> 01:33:04,793
Pass him.
- No, I won't.

696
01:33:05,166 --> 01:33:07,134
If the vial leaks,

697
01:33:07,235 --> 01:33:09,795
not just you and I, the whole state will
be wiped out in 48 hours.

698
01:33:10,839 --> 01:33:12,534
Is it a germ-bomb?
- Yes.

699
01:33:12,974 --> 01:33:15,067
Like Anthrax on Discovery Channel?

700
01:33:16,845 --> 01:33:17,903
Somewhat similar.

701
01:33:18,012 --> 01:33:19,479
Give it, please.
- Okay.

702
01:33:19,581 --> 01:33:22,049
Wait.
- Now what?

703
01:33:24,119 --> 01:33:27,919
May good occur to those
who bear goodwill for others in heart.

704
01:33:28,723 --> 01:33:31,055
And blessings be upon those...

705
01:33:31,626 --> 01:33:33,560
Who preach that goodness.

706
01:33:40,735 --> 01:33:41,565
Don't say sorry to me.

707
01:33:42,003 --> 01:33:43,095
God. I'm sorry.

708
01:33:44,139 --> 01:33:45,231
Forgive me, Lord Narayana.

709
01:33:46,541 --> 01:33:50,568
Let the idol remain here.
Let's see if can find any ice nearby.

710
01:33:51,646 --> 01:33:52,271
Why ice?

711
01:33:52,747 --> 01:33:55,079
So, God doesn't heat up.
You stay here.

712
01:33:55,183 --> 01:33:58,118
Wait! All alone
Near a pyre?

713
01:33:58,219 --> 01:33:59,083
What about God?

714
01:33:59,154 --> 01:34:00,121
I'll go and you stay.

715
01:34:01,956 --> 01:34:02,980
Get two or three kilos of ice.

716
01:34:06,261 --> 01:34:08,320
Come along.
- But your God?

717
01:34:09,330 --> 01:34:10,524
Who need to look after God?
We'll tell the police first.

718
01:34:10,832 --> 01:34:11,958
They'll look after the rest.

719
01:34:14,202 --> 01:34:15,931
God damn ice.
Curse my luck.

720
01:34:16,304 --> 01:34:18,329
We aren't even connected by a long shot.

721
01:34:21,209 --> 01:34:23,143
You bury the idol and I get punished.

722
01:34:24,312 --> 01:34:25,677
Hey, wait!

723
01:34:28,616 --> 01:34:31,016
Wait, where will you find ice?

724
01:34:32,053 --> 01:34:34,886
Look, stop dragging me all over the place.

725
01:34:36,991 --> 01:34:38,686
Sir, do you have ice?

726
01:34:39,294 --> 01:34:40,488
I don't see rice here.

727
01:34:41,162 --> 01:34:44,757
Not rice. Ice, ice.
- Quiet. I'll ask him.

728
01:34:49,337 --> 01:34:50,133
The thing over there.

729
01:34:50,305 --> 01:34:52,637
Are you kidding me?
I'm not deaf.

730
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:54,002
I couldn't hear because of those
lorries noise.

731
01:34:54,142 --> 01:34:55,276
What iced drink do you want?

732
01:34:55,276 --> 01:34:59,872
Not drinks. Just give me ice
worth a hundred dollars.

733
01:35:00,949 --> 01:35:06,683
You take me for a pawnbroker?
- It'll fetch you 4.500 bucks

734
01:35:07,055 --> 01:35:10,115
Not for Rs 4.500.
I'll give for Rs. 25 max. Agreed?

735
01:35:10,291 --> 01:35:12,927
This is so unfair.

736
01:35:12,927 --> 01:35:14,329
You think I run a bank?

737
01:35:14,329 --> 01:35:17,765
Okay. I'll give ice for Rs. 35.

738
01:35:19,901 --> 01:35:21,869
Why are you crying for ice?
I'll give it to you.

739
01:35:22,804 --> 01:35:24,738
Wait, I go to break the chunk of ice.
- Okay.

740
01:35:26,107 --> 01:35:28,166
Are you a baby?
- I've ice only for Rs. 10.

741
01:35:28,276 --> 01:35:29,538
Just give me whatever you have.

742
01:35:29,777 --> 01:35:31,574
Why are you crying?
- Look down there.

743
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:34,282
It's filthy.
- Tea shops are like that.

744
01:35:34,282 --> 01:35:38,116
Man, the tv.
- Damn! All important cricket

745
01:35:38,286 --> 01:35:39,651
The text below.

746
01:35:41,122 --> 01:35:44,751
A Brahmin girl
Indian-American terrorist's lover.

747
01:35:47,195 --> 01:35:51,332
Chennai airport; Policeman gunned down.

748
01:35:51,332 --> 01:35:54,062
Escaped Indian-American
scientist turned terrorist.

749
01:35:54,736 --> 01:35:57,830
May have a Brahmin lover named Andal.

750
01:35:57,939 --> 01:36:00,742
The investigating officer...
- Mr. Balram Naidu has revealed!

751
01:36:00,742 --> 01:36:02,710
Why does he reveal all this?
- Damn him!

752
01:36:03,211 --> 01:36:06,203
I was fine where was. With a germ-bomb
parcel, you destroyed my life.

753
01:36:06,648 --> 01:36:08,850
Now, you've made laughing stock of me!

754
01:36:08,850 --> 01:36:10,283
How did make laughing stock of you?

755
01:36:10,585 --> 01:36:14,282
Seems like you're crying?
- You dare to joke?

756
01:36:14,555 --> 01:36:16,580
Don't ever spit on me like that.

757
01:36:16,691 --> 01:36:18,682
I'm not married yet!
- So. you'll spit?

758
01:36:20,261 --> 01:36:22,252
Tell me a way out.

759
01:36:23,798 --> 01:36:27,666
My marriage broker will ask
for explanations.

760
01:36:27,769 --> 01:36:31,170
How will l explain?
What am I going to do?

761
01:36:33,941 --> 01:36:36,144
Say it's all gossip.
Say we are just....

762
01:36:36,144 --> 01:36:38,044
Just friends?

763
01:36:38,179 --> 01:36:39,908
You think I'm a film actress?

764
01:36:40,515 --> 01:36:44,652
I'm from an orthodox family.
You've brought me to the streets.

765
01:36:44,652 --> 01:36:45,949
You go.

766
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:00,963
Shall I put it in a bag?
- Yes.

767
01:37:03,538 --> 01:37:05,768
They drive like they are blind.
Sand in my eyes.

768
01:37:05,873 --> 01:37:07,704
They are blind.
But they see money in sand.

769
01:37:07,875 --> 01:37:12,539
I've seen millions of sand
lorries rob the lands.

770
01:37:16,317 --> 01:37:18,217
You think they'll take sand near
the Chola temple?

771
01:37:18,586 --> 01:37:20,451
They've encroached as far as the bridge.
What's a temple!

772
01:37:20,588 --> 01:37:21,555
Oh, no.

773
01:37:22,623 --> 01:37:26,491
Someone has kidnapped my daughter.
Investigate that first.

774
01:37:26,594 --> 01:37:28,824
You want to grill Grandma instead?

775
01:37:28,963 --> 01:37:31,227
What happened?
- The vehicle is ready.

776
01:37:31,566 --> 01:37:33,796
The bonnet is dented,
but the jeep runs.

777
01:37:33,868 --> 01:37:36,837
You understood?
- Not a damn thing.

778
01:37:36,938 --> 01:37:38,166
It means we must go now.

779
01:37:38,272 --> 01:37:40,274
Grandma is very old.

780
01:37:40,274 --> 01:37:43,141
Grandma is mentally unstable.
She can't take an inquest.

781
01:37:43,277 --> 01:37:46,110
She's pushing 95.
- She doesn't have to push anything.

782
01:37:46,247 --> 01:37:49,910
The vehicle is ready. You don't get it?
- Sir, you don't get it?

783
01:37:50,284 --> 01:37:52,718
We are not criminals.
This is a monastery, mind it!

784
01:37:57,558 --> 01:37:59,856
So what? Why won't there be criminals
inside a monastery?

785
01:38:00,695 --> 01:38:05,098
I suspect each and every one of you.
I'll investigate.

786
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:10,535
Ours is very reputed clan.
Several families live in America.

787
01:38:10,772 --> 01:38:14,308
But we've no connection with the
American terrorist. We're very religious.

788
01:38:14,308 --> 01:38:16,708
We know nothing.
Please stop.

789
01:38:17,745 --> 01:38:19,144
Do you know about our Azhagiya Singer?

790
01:38:20,181 --> 01:38:21,808
You mean the pretty singer?

791
01:38:22,083 --> 01:38:23,710
Madonna?
- God damn!

792
01:38:23,918 --> 01:38:27,786
Our singers are talented.
But they are not as glamorous.

793
01:38:28,055 --> 01:38:30,523
But why all this now?
- You started this.

794
01:38:30,591 --> 01:38:34,618
What did I start?
- Azhagiya Singer is our guru, high priest.

795
01:38:34,862 --> 01:38:36,597
Yes.
- He's away in Delhi.

796
01:38:36,597 --> 01:38:39,065
How will face him when he returns?

797
01:38:42,637 --> 01:38:45,538
Promise her rose milk.
She'll go. She's nuts.

798
01:38:46,574 --> 01:38:50,311
Or, say that her dead son has returned.
She'll go anywhere you want.

799
01:38:50,311 --> 01:38:51,744
Go inside, you little brat!

800
01:38:55,550 --> 01:38:59,953
The dead son's name?
- Aravamudan.

801
01:39:04,826 --> 01:39:05,918
Your son.

802
01:39:06,828 --> 01:39:09,058
Aravamudan?
- Yes.

803
01:39:09,964 --> 01:39:11,866
Aravamudan.
- Yes, my son.

804
01:39:11,866 --> 01:39:15,736
He has bought lots of rose milk and
is waiting.

805
01:39:15,736 --> 01:39:19,103
Meet him, drink rose milk and
answer to my questions.

806
01:39:19,207 --> 01:39:20,606
Come along.
- Okay, lets go.

807
01:39:25,947 --> 01:39:26,743
Load the lorry.

808
01:39:27,882 --> 01:39:28,746
Tell them in Tamil.

809
01:39:29,884 --> 01:39:31,252
Hey, who are you?
Where are you going?

810
01:39:31,252 --> 01:39:33,220
My stuff is stuck inside
.

811
01:39:33,521 --> 01:39:35,512
Inside the sand.
- My God.

812
01:39:36,624 --> 01:39:38,125
Tell them to stop.
- You stop first.

813
01:39:38,125 --> 01:39:41,856
Hey! Off the engine.
- Off it.

814
01:39:42,697 --> 01:39:43,629
Let them come.

815
01:39:46,067 --> 01:39:48,058
Are you guys activist?

816
01:39:48,236 --> 01:39:51,763
No, I'm just a pacifist.
He's the terrorist.

817
01:39:51,873 --> 01:39:53,534
Will you shut up?
- You shut up.

818
01:39:53,641 --> 01:39:56,667
We buried the idol
of Lord Govindarajan here.

819
01:39:56,777 --> 01:39:58,813
Are you making up a tale?
- I swear, it's true.

820
01:39:58,813 --> 01:40:01,577
It was on tv.
He's a popular terrorist.

821
01:40:01,716 --> 01:40:03,284
No, I'm a scientist.

822
01:40:03,284 --> 01:40:04,308
I hardly know her.

823
01:40:05,686 --> 01:40:09,554
What are you up to in a crematorium?
Black magic?

824
01:40:09,690 --> 01:40:11,055
What have you done?
- What?

825
01:40:11,158 --> 01:40:14,195
He's a terrorist.
We'll get 25 million if we hand him over.

826
01:40:14,195 --> 01:40:15,287
He's the one.

827
01:40:15,997 --> 01:40:18,056
It's my photo in the papers.

828
01:40:18,666 --> 01:40:22,067
See? He's in the papers.
You didn't believe me? He's the one.

829
01:40:22,203 --> 01:40:23,795
You wretch!
- Wait.

830
01:40:23,905 --> 01:40:26,738
Let me have the deity.
You can keep him.

831
01:40:26,841 --> 01:40:29,002
Lady, I'd prefer it vice versa.
- Oh, boy...

832
01:40:29,911 --> 01:40:30,809
I didn't mean that.

833
01:40:31,546 --> 01:40:35,880
We keep 25 million,
the police keeps this guy. But wait.

834
01:40:36,584 --> 01:40:37,915
My boy!
- Yes, brother.

835
01:40:38,352 --> 01:40:44,291
If this lady complains about us when
we turn this guy in, will they listen?

836
01:40:44,992 --> 01:40:46,357
What complaint?
- If she says

837
01:40:47,328 --> 01:40:50,559
A fat contractor,
his bearded assistant

838
01:40:50,798 --> 01:40:54,564
And his lorry drivers raped me.

839
01:40:55,236 --> 01:40:57,704
Will they believe?
- No way.

840
01:40:58,272 --> 01:41:02,265
If you want money, turn
us in to the police.

841
01:41:02,910 --> 01:41:04,878
If you lay your fingers on her,
I don't know what I'll do then.

842
01:41:05,279 --> 01:41:08,840
What will you do?
Look behind you.

843
01:41:10,051 --> 01:41:11,143
Hold him, guys.

844
01:41:14,388 --> 01:41:15,912
I love this game.

845
01:41:16,290 --> 01:41:19,521
You can shout, you can scream, you can
even scratch my back with your nails.

846
01:41:20,061 --> 01:41:23,553
What are you gaping at?
Showing a movie here?

847
01:41:23,931 --> 01:41:25,694
Off the headlights!

848
01:41:27,802 --> 01:41:29,997
Switch on the damn temple lights,
you fools!

849
01:41:31,105 --> 01:41:32,003
Come, lady!

850
01:41:35,309 --> 01:41:37,641
You fat slobs!
Catch her. Run.

851
01:41:37,979 --> 01:41:38,968
Stop, lady!

852
01:41:45,186 --> 01:41:46,153
Let go!

853
01:41:46,253 --> 01:41:47,083
Please let me go!

854
01:42:19,353 --> 01:42:20,650
Careful, cactus.

855
01:42:27,662 --> 01:42:29,563
Takes you so long to pin
him down?

856
01:42:29,563 --> 01:42:31,588
Rascals, scoundrels! Ok, sorry brothers.
- Let's go, baby.

857
01:42:31,699 --> 01:42:34,862
Don't you have sisters?
- Who said so?

858
01:42:35,036 --> 01:42:39,029
I got a sister, mother, wife.
What don't have is this You come.

859
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:41,308
Somebody help me.

860
01:42:41,909 --> 01:42:43,638
My point I'll help you
I'll keep you.

861
01:42:44,045 --> 01:42:45,808
Lord Narayana!

862
01:42:50,785 --> 01:42:54,744
For the first time
on Indian television,

863
01:42:54,889 --> 01:42:57,258
Footage shown never before.

864
01:42:57,258 --> 01:42:59,783
Uncensored.

865
01:43:00,194 --> 01:43:03,061
A must for all the family audiences.

866
01:43:03,164 --> 01:43:04,995
A rape scene.

867
01:43:05,633 --> 01:43:06,600
Hold this.

868
01:43:06,701 --> 01:43:09,636
Ain't talking about the girl.
I'm talking about our mother Earth.

869
01:43:09,804 --> 01:43:15,106
Everyone sings praises of mother Earth.
Now watch her getting raped.

870
01:43:15,242 --> 01:43:17,733
The rape of this girl is a sideshow.

871
01:43:17,845 --> 01:43:21,178
If you've done it once, it comes easily.

872
01:43:21,282 --> 01:43:25,086
I know who they work for.
They deserve to know, too.

873
01:43:25,086 --> 01:43:26,053
Tell them.

874
01:43:26,153 --> 01:43:29,122
JaRa: Ja Raghavender
They work for him.

875
01:43:29,757 --> 01:43:33,284
A riverbeds have been scrapped
till the clay shows.

876
01:43:33,994 --> 01:43:36,895
Thanks to these whoresons who don't care
if the world is destroyed.

877
01:43:37,098 --> 01:43:41,262
Look. Take a photo of it.
You got that?

878
01:43:41,569 --> 01:43:45,130
That's a 12th century Chola temple
and they don't respect that.

879
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:46,998
Look.

880
01:43:49,577 --> 01:43:54,139
That's a graveyard for the Dalits.
They've no respect for that either.

881
01:43:55,316 --> 01:43:59,776
A 3 day old grave will be dug out,
the dead discarded.

882
01:44:00,287 --> 01:44:02,016
The sand quarried.

883
01:44:02,123 --> 01:44:07,228
I ask for justice.
And what does JaRa do?

884
01:44:07,228 --> 01:44:10,686
Frames me as an anti-social,
throws me in jail.

885
01:44:11,098 --> 01:44:12,963
But you can't jail the truth.

886
01:44:13,067 --> 01:44:14,034
Why have you brought a crowd?

887
01:44:15,269 --> 01:44:18,636
You touch an untouchable when it suits you!
Hands off me!

888
01:44:18,839 --> 01:44:21,637
Who knows what shit you've
on your hands digging sand?

889
01:44:21,909 --> 01:44:23,677
Shall we talk to the village council?

890
01:44:23,677 --> 01:44:27,511
Council? It's a kangaroo court.
What's there to talk?

891
01:44:29,583 --> 01:44:34,213
You dogs shit on the plates that feed you.
What's the point talking to you?

892
01:44:34,889 --> 01:44:40,694
In his lust, a mercenary trader won't know
between a mother and a sister.

893
01:44:40,694 --> 01:44:42,889
One's whore and another's wife.

894
01:44:43,898 --> 01:44:46,059
Only when someone like me reminds you,
are you likely to realize.

895
01:44:47,601 --> 01:44:48,569
Are you shooting. SunTV?

896
01:44:48,569 --> 01:44:49,763
Your name?
- Go away!

897
01:44:50,871 --> 01:44:53,999
If my face appears on tv,
there will be murder.

898
01:44:55,676 --> 01:44:56,643
Murder?

899
01:44:57,044 --> 01:45:00,343
You may own a thousand trucks
and benchmen, but turn around.

900
01:45:00,548 --> 01:45:03,540
Millions are seeing through the camera.

901
01:45:03,651 --> 01:45:06,119
Murdering millions is a tall talk
even for your thousands.

902
01:45:06,987 --> 01:45:10,057
It's the people's voice.
Don't try to shut it away.

903
01:45:10,057 --> 01:45:11,547
If you can, shut your trap
and cover your rear.

904
01:45:12,293 --> 01:45:13,885
Boovaragan.
- Yes.

905
01:45:14,061 --> 01:45:16,154
I'll tell the boss.
You're going to be destroyed.

906
01:45:16,263 --> 01:45:19,664
You'll dig and the earth is destroyed.
And I'm asking why you do it.

907
01:45:19,767 --> 01:45:21,101
We will do it.
We have permit.

908
01:45:21,101 --> 01:45:25,561
A permit issued in whose name,
JaRa's, his wife Gajalaxmi's?

909
01:45:25,706 --> 01:45:28,004
Or his mistress? What's her name?
- Meenakshi.

910
01:45:28,142 --> 01:45:30,610
Don't you dare call my sister a mistress!

911
01:45:30,711 --> 01:45:33,043
You are Meenakshi's sibling?

912
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:34,112
No, I'm her elder brother.

913
01:45:35,316 --> 01:45:37,876
Stupid, it's the same either way.
Show me the permit.

914
01:45:37,952 --> 01:45:41,581
Can you read it?
How many can read in your crowd?

915
01:45:42,323 --> 01:45:48,193
Which era do you live in?
You won't find an unlettered man among us.

916
01:45:48,562 --> 01:45:51,326
Not counting me.
- You're an unlettered genius.

917
01:45:51,532 --> 01:45:53,090
Is that so?
All right.

918
01:45:53,267 --> 01:45:54,996
We have geniuses and lettered
geniuses

919
01:45:55,169 --> 01:45:57,899
Here, Kapilan. How learned are you?
- M.A. M Phil.

920
01:45:58,038 --> 01:46:01,303
He writes songs for movies.
He'll put down my tirade in a song.

921
01:46:01,609 --> 01:46:03,270
Tell him your poem on pebbles.

922
01:46:03,844 --> 01:46:05,539
Sands,
the offspring of pebbles.

923
01:46:06,113 --> 01:46:09,207
Cut sandbanks,
you cut off our babies' babble.

924
01:46:09,950 --> 01:46:12,145
Yes, unlike cutting hair.
At least, hair grows back.

925
01:46:12,753 --> 01:46:13,720
Proceed.

926
01:46:14,088 --> 01:46:15,578
Enough. A grain of rice tells
how well the pot is cooking.

927
01:46:15,689 --> 01:46:18,590
But his pot is big.
More.

928
01:46:18,792 --> 01:46:20,282
Renounce robbery,

929
01:46:20,728 --> 01:46:22,195
Return the stolen sands.

930
01:46:22,863 --> 01:46:24,091
If stealing still continues,

931
01:46:24,298 --> 01:46:26,027
Hack him into two pieces.

932
01:46:26,166 --> 01:46:26,894
Well said!

933
01:46:27,001 --> 01:46:32,172
If you change the soil like meat,
where will our girls play.

934
01:46:32,172 --> 01:46:36,836
Where will migrating birds nest
and our children build their castles.

935
01:46:36,977 --> 01:46:38,171
He steals eggs from their nests.

936
01:46:40,614 --> 01:46:41,638
Hey, get him!

937
01:46:41,749 --> 01:46:43,284
Don't let him out of sight.
- Where can he go?

938
01:46:43,284 --> 01:46:45,752
We have it all on camera.
- Got him.

939
01:46:52,993 --> 01:46:54,858
Where is the nearest police station?
- How do I know?

940
01:46:55,329 --> 01:46:56,159
But it's your hometown?

941
01:46:57,031 --> 01:46:59,727
You have exported me!
First a fruit cart, bus, train. Now lorry.

942
01:47:00,868 --> 01:47:01,926
Take me to Chidambaram.

943
01:47:02,536 --> 01:47:04,271
Take your hand off your cheek
and drive.

944
01:47:04,271 --> 01:47:05,863
Still hurts. She hit me.

945
01:47:05,973 --> 01:47:08,703
An ice pack will do you good.
- But she hit me with an ice pack!

946
01:47:09,677 --> 01:47:11,872
Shut up and chase.

947
01:47:14,181 --> 01:47:16,012
You think I'll get scared
if you drive it like a flying saucer?

948
01:47:16,684 --> 01:47:17,844
Out of the way.
- What's the hurry?

949
01:47:18,252 --> 01:47:20,186
You didn't read in the papers?
The American terrorist is escaping.

950
01:47:20,688 --> 01:47:23,624
Which terrorist?
Dr. Govind and his Brahmin girlfriend?

951
01:47:23,624 --> 01:47:26,821
Yes! I was the first to identify them.
- Is that important now? Move aside.

952
01:47:33,834 --> 01:47:37,634
Pondicherry 20km on that sign.
- We'll find a police station here.

953
01:47:37,738 --> 01:47:39,933
My God won't go there.
His place is Chidambaram.

954
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:44,033
He is supposed to be everywhere.
Why not Pondicherry?

955
01:47:44,178 --> 01:47:46,203
Do not scorn.
If we're alive, it's only because of Him.

956
01:47:47,047 --> 01:47:48,036
Turn around to Chidambaram.

957
01:47:48,282 --> 01:47:50,876
Why tell me? Tell your god.
He will turn us around.

958
01:48:13,073 --> 01:48:16,099
God. thank You.
Thank You, Father.

959
01:48:21,115 --> 01:48:22,082
Hold this.

960
01:48:26,153 --> 01:48:27,087
Faster.

961
01:48:27,087 --> 01:48:28,554
Why did you switch off the lights?

962
01:48:29,223 --> 01:48:30,247
Saving electricity.

963
01:48:32,926 --> 01:48:34,917
Shut up or get up?
- Whatever up.

964
01:48:36,330 --> 01:48:38,560
Up now, please!
- What a Tamil!

965
01:48:45,706 --> 01:48:48,106
Filthy sack!
You've no respect for God?

966
01:48:48,208 --> 01:48:49,197
I've much respect.

967
01:48:49,309 --> 01:48:52,836
But if we flash his gold and diamonds at
midnight, someone might mug us.

968
01:48:53,313 --> 01:48:54,746
Give Him to me.

969
01:48:54,915 --> 01:48:59,113
Let's check out that van.
- What I am now, a mechanic?

970
01:48:59,787 --> 01:49:00,811
Allah!

971
01:49:01,288 --> 01:49:03,724
Taking my God to Chidambaram
is important.

972
01:49:03,724 --> 01:49:04,816
People are more important for me.

973
01:49:04,925 --> 01:49:05,789
You stay here.

974
01:49:15,302 --> 01:49:16,203
This leg is stuck. Somebody help!

975
01:49:16,203 --> 01:49:17,261
Hei, Yusuf, come out.

976
01:49:17,538 --> 01:49:18,095
Watch it.

977
01:49:18,205 --> 01:49:19,536
Easy on that leg.

978
01:49:20,541 --> 01:49:22,475
Salim, where are you?

979
01:49:22,876 --> 01:49:23,865
I'm here, dad.

980
01:49:23,977 --> 01:49:26,878
Come out.
- Can't, my leg is stuck.

981
01:49:26,980 --> 01:49:28,948
Your leg too?
Is it broken?

982
01:49:29,049 --> 01:49:31,279
Not broken.
Stuck in a slushy hole.

983
01:49:31,752 --> 01:49:34,888
Baby! Where's Baby?
- A baby is missing?

984
01:49:34,888 --> 01:49:37,254
I see a head. There's someone here.
- I see a leg.

985
01:49:37,524 --> 01:49:38,513
Someone is here.

986
01:49:38,659 --> 01:49:40,650
Head, leg, all belong to the same baby.

987
01:49:41,995 --> 01:49:43,758
Baby, come out.

988
01:49:45,032 --> 01:49:47,933
Baby, come on.
Come out.

989
01:49:55,742 --> 01:49:57,642
Whatâ€™s this?
He will feel bad.

990
01:49:57,978 --> 01:49:59,070
Hope nothing is wrong with you?

991
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:02,048
Oh. I'm just a bit tall.

992
01:50:02,549 --> 01:50:03,846
A bit?

993
01:50:04,284 --> 01:50:06,912
I've been calling you forever,
why don't you answer?

994
01:50:07,087 --> 01:50:11,956
I would but little brother's foot
was stuck and

995
01:50:12,326 --> 01:50:13,554
I felt like puking.

996
01:50:13,627 --> 01:50:15,925
His foot was stuck.
You could have yelled.

997
01:50:16,096 --> 01:50:18,223
His foot was stuck in my mouth.

998
01:50:18,332 --> 01:50:20,630
Your mouth?
I thought it's a big hole.

999
01:50:20,767 --> 01:50:23,292
Yes, I do talk a lot.

1000
01:50:23,537 --> 01:50:24,526
My legs are aching.

1001
01:50:24,705 --> 01:50:27,731
Thanks be to Allah, nobody is hurt.
- Thanks be.

1002
01:50:29,843 --> 01:50:32,835
It has stopped, dad.
Watch your step.

1003
01:50:33,180 --> 01:50:37,173
Brother. help daddy. He's unsteady.
- Iâ€™ll take care of dad.

1004
01:50:37,684 --> 01:50:41,017
Who are you?
- I'm Kalif Ullah. This is my family.

1005
01:50:41,121 --> 01:50:43,690
How did this happen to you?
- A lorry hit us.

1006
01:50:43,690 --> 01:50:44,816
A lorry hit and you become tall?

1007
01:50:47,161 --> 01:50:50,187
See that Lorries.
One of them hit our van.

1008
01:50:58,839 --> 01:51:00,238
Why are we hiding?
- Wait.

1009
01:51:02,209 --> 01:51:05,975
Boss, this van. This lorry,
dash-dashed and rolled down.

1010
01:51:07,814 --> 01:51:10,942
How do you know what I stepped on?
You're a genius.

1011
01:51:18,625 --> 01:51:22,891
Why are we hiding?
- Quiet! I'm listening.

1012
01:51:25,999 --> 01:51:31,130
Investigating suspicious circumstances.
You guys wait on the highway.

1013
01:51:31,872 --> 01:51:35,069
Who are you? Why are you here?
Why is the van parked like that?

1014
01:51:35,742 --> 01:51:37,972
A lorry driver hit us.

1015
01:51:41,815 --> 01:51:45,182
Who hit you?
The lorry or the driver?

1016
01:51:45,385 --> 01:51:46,215
Keep quiet!

1017
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:48,083
A lorry driver hit us.

1018
01:51:48,188 --> 01:51:50,213
Your family?
- Yes.

1019
01:51:50,357 --> 01:51:51,847
And this lighthouse?

1020
01:51:51,992 --> 01:51:53,983
My son.
- The little boy?

1021
01:51:54,094 --> 01:51:54,992
He is my son too.

1022
01:51:55,095 --> 01:51:57,563
You're sure? Even that one?
- Why do you doubt?

1023
01:51:57,698 --> 01:51:59,632
Doubting is our job.
- And that girl?

1024
01:51:59,766 --> 01:52:01,028
Will you shut up?

1025
01:52:02,236 --> 01:52:04,805
Was a sand carrier hit you?

1026
01:52:04,805 --> 01:52:08,639
Sand or gold, never saw.
All know is, a lorry hit us.

1027
01:52:08,775 --> 01:52:13,542
This man... Where is he?
This man and his wife saved us.

1028
01:52:14,381 --> 01:52:17,350
Who and whose wife?
- Is it important?

1029
01:52:19,219 --> 01:52:22,518
Did you look inside the lorry?
- Yes. There was a man.

1030
01:52:22,990 --> 01:52:24,014
And a boy.

1031
01:52:26,226 --> 01:52:28,996
What hush-hush?
- You're a girl, I assure you.

1032
01:52:28,996 --> 01:52:30,964
How can you say that!
- Okay, you're neither. Drop it.

1033
01:52:32,566 --> 01:52:36,058
Did he look like a terrorist?

1034
01:52:36,203 --> 01:52:38,296
What -ist?
- What terror?

1035
01:52:39,706 --> 01:52:41,264
Did he look like a terrorist?

1036
01:52:41,908 --> 01:52:44,645
Yes, sir!
You do look like a terrorist.

1037
01:52:44,645 --> 01:52:46,613
Not me. The other guy!

1038
01:52:46,613 --> 01:52:48,547
Damn! Start the car.
- Right away, sir.

1039
01:52:50,183 --> 01:52:54,888
Wait... Lorry number?
- What's the lorry number?

1040
01:52:54,888 --> 01:52:56,048
Lorry number is

1041
01:52:56,256 --> 01:52:58,019
Wait, I'm coming.

1042
01:52:58,258 --> 01:53:00,726
I'm sorry for you guys.
Is anyone hurt?

1043
01:53:00,827 --> 01:53:02,852
By Allah's grace, no one is hurt.

1044
01:53:03,764 --> 01:53:07,962
We're on a criminal-chase.
Wait. I'll send a tow truck.

1045
01:53:08,335 --> 01:53:11,566
Hit the siren.
- Sir! Your name, sir?

1046
01:53:11,672 --> 01:53:14,971
My name is Balram Naidu.
Let's go.

1047
01:53:19,379 --> 01:53:21,108
You're leaving your wife behind?

1048
01:53:21,281 --> 01:53:24,682
Holy water.
- Grandma wants holy water.

1049
01:53:24,918 --> 01:53:26,078
Holy water?
- Yes.

1050
01:53:26,186 --> 01:53:28,245
Mineral water, sir.
- Oh.

1051
01:53:29,656 --> 01:53:33,092
Don't drink too much. We'll have to look
for bathrooms. I'm on a chase.

1052
01:53:33,193 --> 01:53:36,253
Holy water, holy smoke.
Is there an accelerator?

1053
01:53:36,530 --> 01:53:38,259
Yes.
- Step on it.

1054
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:43,296
If only you'd stop chattering.
I'd have caught up with him.

1055
01:53:43,570 --> 01:53:44,662
Who's catching whom now?

1056
01:53:44,771 --> 01:53:47,137
Shoe.
- If I'm shoe, you are sock.

1057
01:53:49,042 --> 01:53:51,645
Yes, you're like shoe and sock.
Perfect pairing.

1058
01:53:51,645 --> 01:53:52,612
Even you.

1059
01:53:52,713 --> 01:53:54,112
You saved us.

1060
01:53:54,314 --> 01:53:56,248
Like me. You shall beget many children.

1061
01:53:56,383 --> 01:53:59,119
Sons like him, daughters like you.

1062
01:53:59,119 --> 01:54:00,108
Insha Allah!

1063
01:54:01,355 --> 01:54:02,686
What rubbish!

1064
01:54:02,789 --> 01:54:05,587
At sundown, I'm your lover.
By night, I'm your wife.

1065
01:54:05,692 --> 01:54:07,990
Now, she's my midwife!
Next what, immaculate Conception?

1066
01:54:08,862 --> 01:54:11,990
Never look a gift horse in the mouth.
- What gift? What horse?

1067
01:54:12,366 --> 01:54:15,168
She is. If not for them.
Fletcher would have killed us.

1068
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:16,897
Who the hell is Fletcher?

1069
01:54:17,003 --> 01:54:19,563
He was chasing the train.
- Didn't see.

1070
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:22,070
He was here minutes ago.
- You wouldn't even let me see.

1071
01:54:22,676 --> 01:54:25,312
The man you didn't see
is Fletcher CIA.

1072
01:54:25,312 --> 01:54:27,872
Goodness! Allah!
- What's it, dad?

1073
01:54:28,548 --> 01:54:31,176
Blood! Whose blood is this?
- What's up?

1074
01:54:32,219 --> 01:54:35,655
What happened? Wife!
You care for everyone, you don't take care.

1075
01:54:37,257 --> 01:54:39,191
Stop the car!

1076
01:54:50,971 --> 01:54:52,165
Step aside.
- Okay.

1077
01:54:54,007 --> 01:54:54,939
Hold this.

1078
01:54:55,142 --> 01:54:59,636
Goodness, my saree is blood-stained
- Don't worry.

1079
01:55:00,147 --> 01:55:03,605
My sister's dress will fit you.
Noor Jehan, give her a dress.

1080
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:10,590
Sir, you can wear my brother's clothes.

1081
01:55:10,590 --> 01:55:13,058
That's not important.
- No, sir.

1082
01:55:13,226 --> 01:55:16,821
For the help you've done,
I'd give you all our wealth.

1083
01:55:17,197 --> 01:55:20,257
But my dad has already
given away everything.

1084
01:55:20,934 --> 01:55:22,231
What left is little.

1085
01:55:39,719 --> 01:55:41,619
It's cancer and you have
neglected it.

1086
01:55:41,822 --> 01:55:43,585
Immediate surgery is needed.

1087
01:55:44,324 --> 01:55:47,919
Chances are, your vocal chords
will be affected.

1088
01:55:49,663 --> 01:55:50,721
Meaning....?

1089
01:55:51,731 --> 01:55:53,631
The choices are....

1090
01:55:54,935 --> 01:55:59,031
One. I can avoid surgery. Live and sing
another five or six months...

1091
01:55:59,139 --> 01:56:00,902
After five or six months.

1092
01:56:02,676 --> 01:56:03,904
Let me say it.

1093
01:56:05,312 --> 01:56:07,007
The other choice....

1094
01:56:08,215 --> 01:56:12,319
I get operated. Lose my voice
and live another 15 or 20 years.

1095
01:56:12,319 --> 01:56:15,311
Is that it?
- Bluntly speaking, yes.

1096
01:56:19,593 --> 01:56:21,254
God be praised!

1097
01:56:23,129 --> 01:56:27,657
Song is my life. Won't give it up.
Is what you'd expect me to say?

1098
01:56:28,935 --> 01:56:34,601
I would have said so if
I had not meet her.

1099
01:56:37,110 --> 01:56:39,738
If I didn't love her.

1100
01:56:41,081 --> 01:56:42,571
But I do.

1101
01:56:43,583 --> 01:56:44,743
That's my problem.

1102
01:56:46,553 --> 01:56:47,986
Singing is not my life.

1103
01:56:50,257 --> 01:56:51,918
It's my profession.

1104
01:56:52,292 --> 01:56:55,125
She my family.

1105
01:56:57,731 --> 01:57:00,757
Is life. For their sake,
need life.

1106
01:57:05,305 --> 01:57:07,865
The sooner you get operated,
the better it's for you.

1107
01:57:08,775 --> 01:57:11,039
Today's performance.

1108
01:57:11,177 --> 01:57:13,509
Might be my last by God's grace.

1109
01:57:15,916 --> 01:57:17,543
This nurse will accompany you.

1110
01:57:17,651 --> 01:57:22,645
To provide immediate medication
if you feel pain or bleed.

1111
01:57:23,189 --> 01:57:25,157
Your medicines are in the box.

1112
01:57:25,292 --> 01:57:28,489
Give a great performance
and head straight for surgery.

1113
01:57:29,629 --> 01:57:32,189
We know the blood group,
Keep the operation theatre ready.

1114
01:57:32,299 --> 01:57:34,096
As soon as we find blood,
we'll operate.

1115
01:57:35,235 --> 01:57:37,965
Relatives? You know about the surgery?
- Yes, doctor.

1116
01:57:38,538 --> 01:57:41,268
Please save my wife.
Do the surgery.

1117
01:57:41,575 --> 01:57:42,769
It's a rare blood group.

1118
01:57:42,876 --> 01:57:44,077
Once we find the blood,
we'll proceed.

1119
01:57:44,077 --> 01:57:46,568
Doctor. use my blood.

1120
01:57:46,947 --> 01:57:48,812
Who are you?
- My blood.

1121
01:57:48,949 --> 01:57:51,315
She needs blood.
- He's my blood and hers.

1122
01:57:51,952 --> 01:57:54,978
Is he AB+ve?
- All the blood in me is hers.

1123
01:57:55,221 --> 01:57:57,519
Take 5, 10, 70, liters.
As much as you want.

1124
01:57:57,691 --> 01:58:00,285
That happens only in our movies.
I must test your blood.

1125
01:58:02,629 --> 01:58:03,687
Who are you?

1126
01:58:08,568 --> 01:58:11,162
This must be kept in a cool dry place.

1127
01:58:11,304 --> 01:58:14,796
Everything in this hospital is yours!
Just ask.

1128
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:29,184
And me?
- One signature is enough.

1129
01:58:30,523 --> 01:58:33,720
Out of my way, I'll take it.
- You think packed it for you?

1130
01:58:36,029 --> 01:58:39,624
Patience, after I donate blood.
we'll go to the police station together.

1131
01:58:39,733 --> 01:58:41,928
Why must go to the police station?

1132
01:58:42,802 --> 01:58:48,069
It's nothing, brother.
Her brother is a police inspector.

1133
01:58:48,541 --> 01:58:50,143
Good.
Brother in law.

1134
01:58:50,143 --> 01:58:51,007
No, brother.

1135
01:58:51,745 --> 01:58:53,838
Your?
- No, hers. Brother.

1136
01:58:54,514 --> 01:58:57,847
For you, her brother is...
- Oh, you get him?

1137
01:58:58,551 --> 01:59:00,542
What?
- Your brother, my brother in law.

1138
01:59:01,254 --> 01:59:05,281
Brahmins say wife's brother differently.
- Whose wife's brother?

1139
01:59:05,558 --> 01:59:06,718
Mine.

1140
01:59:06,860 --> 01:59:08,885
Your brother,
his police inspector!

1141
01:59:08,995 --> 01:59:10,929
It's all working out,
you understand?

1142
01:59:12,032 --> 01:59:13,226
Neither does he.

1143
01:59:14,234 --> 01:59:16,862
Put it down.
It can roll on its wheels.

1144
01:59:16,970 --> 01:59:18,130
Put it down, sir.

1145
01:59:21,641 --> 01:59:23,609
What's inside is precious.

1146
01:59:23,710 --> 01:59:24,938
Please don't get me wrong.

1147
01:59:25,045 --> 01:59:27,070
How could get you wrong?

1148
01:59:27,147 --> 01:59:31,243
You and I are to become blood relations.
- When and how?

1149
01:59:31,484 --> 01:59:34,146
You're giving blood to my mother.
- Oh, that.

1150
01:59:35,588 --> 01:59:38,258
A million thanks to you and your husband.
- Don't mention it.

1151
01:59:38,258 --> 01:59:40,192
You think we're man and wife?

1152
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:46,062
I see! You're lovers
Eloping to marry.

1153
01:59:46,700 --> 01:59:49,669
I'll explain it all to the brother in law.
- Brother in law?

1154
01:59:49,936 --> 01:59:52,166
Your brother. The police inspector?
- No!

1155
01:59:52,605 --> 01:59:53,833
Correct.
- What's correct?

1156
01:59:54,240 --> 01:59:56,834
What incorrect to you, is correct.

1157
01:59:56,943 --> 01:59:58,501
We need not to tell mother about this.

1158
01:59:58,645 --> 02:00:02,015
Stop! It's getting more confused.
Let's put an end to it.

1159
02:00:02,015 --> 02:00:03,277
Make way.
- Step aside.

1160
02:00:03,983 --> 02:00:05,678
Mr. Kalaful ah...
- Kalif Ullah.

1161
02:00:05,852 --> 02:00:08,082
Fulla whatever!
Do you know that he is a.... ?

1162
02:00:10,056 --> 02:00:11,045
I'm inspector Barath.

1163
02:00:16,629 --> 02:00:18,256
He's the scientist who saved my life.

1164
02:00:18,364 --> 02:00:20,889
For you, maybe.
He's taking out mine.

1165
02:00:20,967 --> 02:00:21,763
Will you be quiet?

1166
02:00:21,901 --> 02:00:24,802
No, lady, you're wrong.
Actually, he's a hero.

1167
02:00:25,872 --> 02:00:27,772
Thank the heroes and villains later.

1168
02:00:29,843 --> 02:00:31,538
You're donating blood,
saving lives.

1169
02:00:31,644 --> 02:00:33,880
But not letting for surgery.
Who are you?

1170
02:00:33,880 --> 02:00:35,074
I'm an innocent.

1171
02:00:37,283 --> 02:00:39,717
Inspector, everyone is after me.
Save me.

1172
02:00:39,819 --> 02:00:41,912
Mr. Innocent, we have to save him first.

1173
02:00:42,021 --> 02:00:43,181
He's got a bullet in the hip.

1174
02:00:47,227 --> 02:00:49,821
Govind, your photos are in tv and papers.
- I know.

1175
02:00:49,929 --> 02:00:51,988
Bad pictures. Out of focus.
- Quiet, please?

1176
02:00:52,398 --> 02:00:54,889
Don't get caught. The local cops
will beat the day lights out of you.

1177
02:00:55,001 --> 02:00:56,593
Go to the police headquarters.

1178
02:00:56,703 --> 02:00:59,105
I'll tell Mr. Naidu to meet you
Balram Naidu of RAW.

1179
02:00:59,105 --> 02:01:00,073
Don't forget.

1180
02:01:00,073 --> 02:01:04,066
Your cell phone please, I'll tell Naidu.
- No, first an anesthetic.

1181
02:01:04,978 --> 02:01:07,640
The brother in law.
It's true then?

1182
02:01:08,915 --> 02:01:11,782
Yes, his friend.
- Yes.

1183
02:01:12,352 --> 02:01:13,842
Brother in law is in the
police station.

1184
02:01:14,621 --> 02:01:16,816
Yes.
- Balram Naidu.

1185
02:01:17,590 --> 02:01:19,251
How do you know Balram Naidu?
- You said so.

1186
02:01:20,226 --> 02:01:21,215
I said so?

1187
02:01:21,327 --> 02:01:22,760
Quiet!

1188
02:01:22,929 --> 02:01:24,624
If Naidu is your brother in law,
you're Telugu.

1189
02:01:24,731 --> 02:01:26,096
But you speak Tamil well.

1190
02:01:26,199 --> 02:01:28,064
Of course!
Ramasamy Naicker is Telugu!

1191
02:01:28,601 --> 02:01:29,302
Which Naicker?

1192
02:01:29,302 --> 02:01:33,830
Your father Naicker. Isn't he?
- Yes, my dad is... oh no!

1193
02:01:34,274 --> 02:01:37,266
You'll give me a blood clot.
I'd rather donate blood. Wait.

1194
02:01:39,145 --> 02:01:41,773
Is there a phone nearby?
- Payphones at the receptions.

1195
02:01:41,881 --> 02:01:42,813
But, haven't got change.

1196
02:01:43,850 --> 02:01:45,977
Do we need money to call police?
- No need.

1197
02:01:56,663 --> 02:01:58,062
You don't know Tamil?

1198
02:02:01,267 --> 02:02:03,030
So. I'm using English.

1199
02:02:05,071 --> 02:02:06,800
Idol means.
- Know, The Lord.

1200
02:02:07,307 --> 02:02:11,038
There's a vial, isn't it? Take it.
Give me my God.

1201
02:02:16,316 --> 02:02:18,113
Where is the statue?
- In the ice-box.

1202
02:02:29,629 --> 02:02:32,031
Carry a cell phone.
Yusuf will take you to the police.

1203
02:02:32,031 --> 02:02:33,726
Sir, come... please.
- Let's go.

1204
02:02:35,068 --> 02:02:36,763
How wonderful!

1205
02:02:37,837 --> 02:02:39,304
I greet you in God's name.

1206
02:02:39,639 --> 02:02:40,663
Sir....
- Yes.

1207
02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:41,808
It's too crowded.

1208
02:02:41,808 --> 02:02:43,742
Better leave from the basement.

1209
02:02:43,843 --> 02:02:46,038
Well, let's take the back exit.

1210
02:03:03,630 --> 02:03:08,158
I want to be as tall as he is.
- Why do you want to be so tall?

1211
02:03:10,169 --> 02:03:11,534
What's happening to you?

1212
02:03:12,171 --> 02:03:12,967
God.

1213
02:03:17,911 --> 02:03:19,003
Nurse, get the ice-box.

1214
02:03:20,914 --> 02:03:22,472
You take the kids along.

1215
02:03:23,883 --> 02:03:25,646
Avtaar Singh, are you okay?
- Perfect.

1216
02:03:32,759 --> 02:03:33,987
I'll sit in front,
you take the rear seat.

1217
02:03:37,797 --> 02:03:38,729
Quickly, please.

1218
02:03:46,940 --> 02:03:47,668
Where is he?

1219
02:03:48,141 --> 02:03:51,668
Govind and I were taking the idol
to the police station.

1220
02:03:52,345 --> 02:03:55,542
I gave him my cell phone turn back
for Yusuf and he's gone.

1221
02:03:56,716 --> 02:03:58,240
I think he went to the police station.

1222
02:04:00,086 --> 02:04:02,281
Who is he?
- Christian Fletcher, CIA.

1223
02:04:06,192 --> 02:04:06,954
We have met already.

1224
02:04:07,260 --> 02:04:08,784
Of course, he's tall.
Noticeable.

1225
02:04:12,065 --> 02:04:13,692
220 centimeters.

1226
02:04:18,037 --> 02:04:19,004
A little.

1227
02:04:19,105 --> 02:04:20,197
Little?
I thought big.

1228
02:04:22,241 --> 02:04:23,731
Mosquito?

1229
02:04:27,313 --> 02:04:30,248
In Japanese, "thank you" is Do Ma?
In Telugu, doma means mosquito.

1230
02:04:53,039 --> 02:04:54,734
Govind, where are you?

1231
02:04:56,676 --> 02:04:57,768
You haven't gone in?

1232
02:04:59,112 --> 02:05:02,843
If you want your fiancee,
the Brahmin lover Andal alive,

1233
02:05:03,950 --> 02:05:06,578
Return with the ice box.
Shall tell you the address?

1234
02:05:32,645 --> 02:05:33,634
He isn't coming!
I'm certain.

1235
02:05:33,780 --> 02:05:35,270
I'm not his moll.
He isn't my lover.

1236
02:05:35,548 --> 02:05:36,480
Ya Allah!

1237
02:05:36,682 --> 02:05:39,879
The two of you eloped to marry.

1238
02:05:39,986 --> 02:05:41,248
Why are you changing your mind now?

1239
02:05:41,587 --> 02:05:44,190
Stop guessing!
I saw him for the first time today.

1240
02:05:44,190 --> 02:05:46,249
And you have already got
us hitched.

1241
02:05:47,193 --> 02:05:48,091
He will not come.

1242
02:05:48,628 --> 02:05:50,118
It is him.
- Not him.

1243
02:05:50,229 --> 02:05:52,595
What if it's him?
- Then, I'll marry him! Fine?

1244
02:05:52,765 --> 02:05:55,598
Don't tell me that, tell him.
- He won't come.

1245
02:05:56,102 --> 02:05:57,592
Govind Uncle is here.

1246
02:06:00,239 --> 02:06:01,797
Andal, don't worry.

1247
02:06:19,358 --> 02:06:20,188
Sit.

1248
02:06:20,893 --> 02:06:22,224
Your future husband has come.

1249
02:06:22,295 --> 02:06:24,923
They say marriages are made in heaven.

1250
02:06:26,699 --> 02:06:27,927
But I think, your marriage
will happen there.

1251
02:06:30,269 --> 02:06:31,904
8 bullets.

1252
02:06:31,904 --> 02:06:34,839
Looks like everyone is going
to the wedding.

1253
02:06:57,230 --> 02:06:58,663
Salim. Salim.

1254
02:07:11,711 --> 02:07:14,703
Don't worry, you saved my mother.

1255
02:07:14,814 --> 02:07:16,907
It's my duty to save your life.
Go.

1256
02:07:19,685 --> 02:07:21,521
Salim, don't worry.

1257
02:07:21,521 --> 02:07:23,089
Our brother and his wife will
take care of you.

1258
02:07:23,089 --> 02:07:24,784
I will take care of
the police.

1259
02:07:25,057 --> 02:07:28,151
Nothing will happen to you.
Insha Allah!

1260
02:07:31,130 --> 02:07:33,564
Stop! Why are you closing the door?
Open the door.

1261
02:07:35,234 --> 02:07:40,536
Aha! The Lighthouse!
Come out, come.

1262
02:07:43,809 --> 02:07:46,209
I couldn't make out your height when
You stood at the pit.

1263
02:07:47,713 --> 02:07:50,273
Go inside. The terrorist is
in this house that Fletcher.

1264
02:08:07,533 --> 02:08:08,659
Yes, boss.

1265
02:08:16,142 --> 02:08:18,201
Hey, who are you?
- Kumar.

1266
02:08:18,344 --> 02:08:19,912
What are you doing here?
- Taking a leak.

1267
02:08:19,912 --> 02:08:21,247
Halt.

1268
02:08:21,247 --> 02:08:23,545
Who's in there?
- No one, you can take a look.

1269
02:08:47,273 --> 02:08:48,740
I'm going.
Why are you hitting me?

1270
02:08:57,950 --> 02:09:00,086
A constable is lying dead.

1271
02:09:00,086 --> 02:09:02,611
A white man, three others and a boy
have escaped.

1272
02:09:02,722 --> 02:09:05,825
From which house did they escape?

1273
02:09:05,825 --> 02:09:07,884
The tailor's shop.
By the back door.

1274
02:09:09,829 --> 02:09:11,897
They escaped through the back alley.

1275
02:09:11,897 --> 02:09:14,667
Late news.
It was on radio yesterday.

1276
02:09:14,667 --> 02:09:20,071
Are you ISI? Lashkar-e-Toiba?
Or?

1277
02:09:20,172 --> 02:09:21,867
Al Qaeda?
- Yes, that.

1278
02:09:22,742 --> 02:09:24,232
I'm non, sir.

1279
02:09:24,477 --> 02:09:27,503
How can one be non?

1280
02:09:27,580 --> 02:09:30,879
In an Afghani outfit?
Tall like a ladder.

1281
02:09:31,017 --> 02:09:32,848
What's your name?
Bin Ladder?

1282
02:09:34,287 --> 02:09:37,051
Don't ridicule me, sir.
My name is Kalif Ullah.

1283
02:09:37,223 --> 02:09:39,214
That's why you're full, ah?

1284
02:09:39,925 --> 02:09:43,759
Seal the street. Everyone in the street
must be questioned.

1285
02:09:43,896 --> 02:09:45,488
The entire street, sir?
- Yes, yes.

1286
02:09:45,598 --> 02:09:48,931
Some 200 people must live down the lane.
- So, what?

1287
02:09:50,670 --> 02:09:53,773
First, question the odd ones.
Damn!

1288
02:09:53,773 --> 02:09:55,608
They are all terrorists.

1289
02:09:55,608 --> 02:09:59,806
Don't think that everyone who prays
towards the Mecca is a terrorist.

1290
02:10:00,646 --> 02:10:05,606
My father has donated his lands
to public cause.

1291
02:10:05,718 --> 02:10:07,583
We may be poor now.

1292
02:10:07,753 --> 02:10:11,917
You see the mosque there?
My father gave the land it stands upon.

1293
02:10:12,024 --> 02:10:13,286
You can ask anyone.

1294
02:10:13,993 --> 02:10:18,692
You gave land, you gave help
and now you've given me an idea.

1295
02:10:18,831 --> 02:10:22,289
You want to interrogate 200 men?
Round them up, stuff them in the mosque.

1296
02:10:22,568 --> 02:10:23,592
No one should come out.

1297
02:10:50,374 --> 02:10:52,501
Boss, why did you push me out?

1298
02:10:59,316 --> 02:11:00,340
Hey, how can you ditch me!

1299
02:11:01,518 --> 02:11:02,576
Turn around.

1300
02:11:06,957 --> 02:11:08,049
Hair-breath escape!

1301
02:11:15,999 --> 02:11:19,457
Can you stop, please?
- Grandma! Why did you get in?

1302
02:11:19,569 --> 02:11:21,400
We are chasing.
When did you get in?

1303
02:11:21,505 --> 02:11:25,498
At Chidambaram. I'm bursting.
Stop it!

1304
02:11:25,642 --> 02:11:31,046
Can't stop! Don't squeeze her.
- Not him. My bladder.

1305
02:11:31,615 --> 02:11:34,017
Oh that! I can't stop.
Control it.

1306
02:11:34,017 --> 02:11:38,055
Excretion must be let out.
Stop the jeep!

1307
02:11:38,055 --> 02:11:42,515
Spit a little out of the window
- What he's blabbering!

1308
02:11:42,659 --> 02:11:46,493
Look, this is my son's photo.

1309
02:11:46,630 --> 02:11:49,190
Take me to him.

1310
02:11:55,272 --> 02:11:56,500
What's happening to you?

1311
02:12:02,979 --> 02:12:05,140
Dad, take the kids outside.
Mom, don't worry. Go outside.

1312
02:12:05,615 --> 02:12:08,448
Nurse, give him the medicine.
- We don't have the medicine.

1313
02:12:08,552 --> 02:12:10,452
But we brought it along.
- It's the wrong box.

1314
02:12:15,959 --> 02:12:18,086
We'll tell them you're unwell.
- No, Ranjita.

1315
02:12:20,363 --> 02:12:21,660
God is testing me.

1316
02:12:25,335 --> 02:12:27,428
How much faith Avaatar has in Him.

1317
02:12:29,206 --> 02:12:31,834
Lord, bless my way.

1318
02:12:33,276 --> 02:12:34,607
In the time of deed,

1319
02:12:36,213 --> 02:12:37,202
May I never wave.

1320
02:12:37,848 --> 02:12:41,340
Give me the confidence
To win always.

1321
02:16:03,386 --> 02:16:04,819
Wasn't it green?

1322
02:16:05,155 --> 02:16:06,884
We have spotted Fletcher's jeep.

1323
02:16:07,824 --> 02:16:09,492
Oh! Spotted? Where?

1324
02:16:09,492 --> 02:16:11,016
Outside the Avtaar Singh show.

1325
02:16:11,127 --> 02:16:14,460
Do you know where the show is?
- Behind us

1326
02:16:16,199 --> 02:16:17,029
Turn around.

1327
02:16:29,946 --> 02:16:31,777
Are they looking for trouble?
- Let's see.

1328
02:16:35,118 --> 02:16:36,449
You don't go.
We'll sort it out.

1329
02:16:47,430 --> 02:16:50,400
Old man, why you fall at my feet,
You have no respect for age?

1330
02:16:50,400 --> 02:16:52,231
Yes, tell me now.
- Why fall at my feet?

1331
02:16:52,302 --> 02:16:53,894
Don't you have respect for age?

1332
02:16:54,037 --> 02:16:56,005
Nowadays, it's not relevant.

1333
02:16:56,439 --> 02:16:58,134
We aren't here to make trouble.

1334
02:16:58,241 --> 02:17:01,802
Today is JaRa's son's birthday.

1335
02:17:02,178 --> 02:17:04,373
It's your God's birthday, too.

1336
02:17:04,547 --> 02:17:05,980
On this auspicious day.

1337
02:17:06,082 --> 02:17:09,313
JaRa wants to beg your pardon.

1338
02:19:06,936 --> 02:19:07,925
Many thanks.

1339
02:19:09,339 --> 02:19:11,307
Our God and your drugs change places.

1340
02:19:11,474 --> 02:19:12,839
Your box is here.

1341
02:19:17,480 --> 02:19:19,175
What's going on here?

1342
02:19:24,320 --> 02:19:25,309
Hey, let go off my boss!

1343
02:19:48,463 --> 02:19:50,693
Oh, no! Call the doctor, please.

1344
02:19:52,934 --> 02:19:54,492
Boy, give me the cotton.

1345
02:20:00,608 --> 02:20:01,802
Where are you going?

1346
02:20:32,540 --> 02:20:33,404
Get on.

1347
02:21:07,509 --> 02:21:10,603
Come, junior. He has come to wish you
on your birthday.

1348
02:21:11,045 --> 02:21:11,977
Greetings!

1349
02:21:12,447 --> 02:21:14,779
I wish you a good health and wealth
for a long life ahead.

1350
02:21:15,150 --> 02:21:16,851
That's fine.
Where is my present?

1351
02:21:16,851 --> 02:21:18,586
You mustnâ€™t ask!
- Son, like father.

1352
02:21:18,586 --> 02:21:19,143
Give him a pen.

1353
02:21:19,420 --> 02:21:22,548
Forgive him. He's just a boy
- But he has asked.

1354
02:21:27,028 --> 02:21:29,394
My birthday is next month.

1355
02:21:31,432 --> 02:21:32,922
Welcome Boovaragan!
Come here.

1356
02:21:40,742 --> 02:21:42,107
Can we talk in private?

1357
02:21:42,343 --> 02:21:43,708
Shall I?

1358
02:23:50,071 --> 02:23:52,665
Wait. After three hours of
discussion.

1359
02:23:52,774 --> 02:23:53,968
Do you want to return
empty handed?

1360
02:23:54,709 --> 02:23:57,011
My men are waiting.
They haven't eaten.

1361
02:23:57,011 --> 02:23:58,808
Got to get home and eat
an honest meal.

1362
02:23:59,647 --> 02:24:01,516
No one is waiting for anyone.

1363
02:24:01,516 --> 02:24:03,882
After four rounds of drinks.
they are eating.

1364
02:24:04,953 --> 02:24:06,045
Look.

1365
02:24:11,759 --> 02:24:15,058
The few who haven't eaten,
will soon be tempted.

1366
02:24:16,531 --> 02:24:19,125
Are you not content with destroying
the land, now you destroy men?

1367
02:24:19,400 --> 02:24:21,459
Then, you'll destroy the Earth?

1368
02:24:21,602 --> 02:24:24,833
And then, the Moon?
You'll even go to the moon.

1369
02:24:25,440 --> 02:24:27,499
Not even an atom bomb will kill you?
You cockroach!

1370
02:24:28,109 --> 02:24:29,667
Talk respectly.

1371
02:24:29,877 --> 02:24:32,513
Mother Earth demands the same
respect.

1372
02:24:32,513 --> 02:24:34,743
To rob the riverbank is a crime.

1373
02:24:35,483 --> 02:24:36,711
Treason!

1374
02:24:36,918 --> 02:24:38,112
Against the Earth!

1375
02:24:38,453 --> 02:24:40,887
We have only one home,
this world.

1376
02:24:41,489 --> 02:24:43,548
Where will you go after you've
destroyed it all?

1377
02:24:43,758 --> 02:24:45,623
Stop talking about the world!

1378
02:24:45,893 --> 02:24:48,361
Who are you to save the world?
Hero of the universe?

1379
02:24:49,897 --> 02:24:52,695
Yes, little brother.
I'm that hero.

1380
02:24:53,901 --> 02:24:55,300
Not only me.

1381
02:24:55,970 --> 02:25:00,134
Every one sperm of the 40 millions
that survives, comes to life...

1382
02:25:00,408 --> 02:25:02,774
Is a hero of the universe.

1383
02:25:03,678 --> 02:25:05,646
But not everyone thinks that way.

1384
02:25:05,780 --> 02:25:08,908
Like you, some would rather
live as happy as worm in filth.

1385
02:25:09,484 --> 02:25:12,510
I wish you a long wriggling life!

1386
02:25:12,620 --> 02:25:13,518
I'm leaving.

1387
02:25:14,055 --> 02:25:16,421
Boovaragan, wait.

1388
02:25:16,891 --> 02:25:18,358
Watch this before you go.

1389
02:26:39,107 --> 02:26:42,941
If the vial cracks, what
scale of danger are we looking at?

1390
02:26:50,118 --> 02:26:51,915
I don't know Telugu.
Let me say it in Tamil.

1391
02:26:52,053 --> 02:26:53,281
The nullifier is. NaCl.

1392
02:26:53,421 --> 02:26:55,821
That's the Tamil Chemistry that
know, NaCl.

1393
02:26:55,957 --> 02:27:00,087
If the vial falls in the wrong hands.
what is the next step?

1394
02:27:00,328 --> 02:27:02,489
Backdoor?
Sorry, not to you.

1395
02:27:03,798 --> 02:27:05,095
So NaCl... this isn't opening.

1396
02:27:07,468 --> 02:27:08,799
How much NaCl is needed?

1397
02:27:08,970 --> 02:27:13,339
If it cracks, mountain-loads will be
needed. Tones and tones of NaCl.

1398
02:27:15,176 --> 02:27:16,404
Everyone will perish.

1399
02:27:34,896 --> 02:27:35,828
Hurry up!

1400
02:27:53,381 --> 02:27:54,109
Help me!

1401
02:29:14,428 --> 02:29:15,326
Andal!

1402
02:30:23,129 --> 02:30:24,687
Give me my God!

1403
02:30:28,601 --> 02:30:29,363
Let go.

1404
02:30:32,539 --> 02:30:33,506
Don't give it to him!

1405
02:32:26,404 --> 02:32:27,996
What's this?
A police station?

1406
02:32:28,173 --> 02:32:30,641
They've thrown in the whole neighborhood
for questioning.

1407
02:32:30,875 --> 02:32:32,399
This is atrocious.

1408
02:32:32,510 --> 02:32:34,034
And you do nothing!

1409
02:32:34,512 --> 02:32:38,073
Calm down. Allah will take
care of us.

1410
02:32:38,316 --> 02:32:41,453
I look you for a good man. And you
gave the idol to that villain?

1411
02:32:41,453 --> 02:32:43,045
Only the idol is with him.
Vial is with me.

1412
02:32:43,154 --> 02:32:44,382
Your God will be fine.

1413
02:32:44,456 --> 02:32:46,185
But if something happens to this?
- How did you get it?

1414
02:32:46,891 --> 02:32:47,983
What?

1415
02:32:50,261 --> 02:32:51,558
Where are we going?

1416
02:32:51,997 --> 02:32:53,328
Please, trust me.
- I trust you.

1417
02:32:54,065 --> 02:32:55,123
You are really a hero!

1418
02:33:00,105 --> 02:33:02,266
Is there a lab or a
hospital nearby?

1419
02:33:02,407 --> 02:33:04,967
For pregnant women or animals, madam?
- He's the one asking.

1420
02:33:05,410 --> 02:33:07,640
Go straight, turn left.

1421
02:33:13,051 --> 02:33:14,518
Why are you hugging us?

1422
02:33:16,154 --> 02:33:17,018
Didn't I tell?

1423
02:33:17,188 --> 02:33:19,520
Before entering inside,
you rub in salt?

1424
02:33:19,958 --> 02:33:20,982
Yes, we do.

1425
02:33:21,659 --> 02:33:23,991
That's the virus-killer,
NaCl. Sodium Chloride.

1426
02:33:24,896 --> 02:33:27,057
Drop it in the pile.
- Not enough. We need more.

1427
02:33:27,232 --> 02:33:28,597
Where's the sea?
- The sea....

1428
02:33:29,534 --> 02:33:35,234
Walk along here, to the other side.
- Not other side, just the opposite.

1429
02:34:08,006 --> 02:34:09,030
My Lord!

1430
02:34:29,360 --> 02:34:31,419
Your India is Great!

1431
02:34:35,100 --> 02:34:35,930
Stop!

1432
02:34:36,901 --> 02:34:37,890
Stop. Fletcher!

1433
02:34:38,636 --> 02:34:39,830
You will die!

1434
02:34:53,852 --> 02:34:54,443
Yuka.

1435
02:34:57,355 --> 02:34:58,117
Yuka is dead.

1436
02:34:58,523 --> 02:35:00,889
Now, he dies for Yuka.

1437
02:35:53,692 --> 02:35:55,992
Are you allright?

1438
02:38:13,051 --> 02:38:14,348
Hey, Fletcher!

1439
02:39:25,823 --> 02:39:26,414
Good God!

1440
02:39:26,991 --> 02:39:30,483
You can say that again.
Oh, God!

1441
02:39:43,808 --> 02:39:45,469
Tsunami, run!

1442
02:40:55,947 --> 02:40:57,938
If we want our kids to lead
better lives than ours,

1443
02:40:58,082 --> 02:40:59,572
We have to feed on others.

1444
02:40:59,684 --> 02:41:03,552
Even your men will swear that your
death was an accident.

1445
02:41:03,688 --> 02:41:08,057
Your corpse and your men corpses
will float without any scars.

1446
02:41:10,495 --> 02:41:14,989
You can still change your mind, what say?
- Only one thing. Kill me.

1447
02:41:15,099 --> 02:41:17,294
Not my men.
They have families.

1448
02:41:17,969 --> 02:41:19,437
Then die a filthy death.

1449
02:41:19,437 --> 02:41:21,928
Filthy?
I'm dying for the Earth.

1450
02:41:22,039 --> 02:41:23,631
But yours will be filthier.

1451
02:41:30,381 --> 02:41:33,077
Daddy, save me.

1452
02:41:53,237 --> 02:41:54,169
My son!

1453
02:42:08,986 --> 02:42:10,476
Save my son.
Boovaragan, don't abandoned my son.

1454
02:42:40,017 --> 02:42:41,109
My son!

1455
02:44:19,583 --> 02:44:22,279
What catastrophe has Allah
brought upon us?

1456
02:44:44,875 --> 02:44:45,933
The idol...

1457
02:44:46,110 --> 02:44:47,509
Give me my idol.

1458
02:44:55,920 --> 02:44:57,410
God has saved everyone.

1459
02:45:00,558 --> 02:45:02,116
You call that saving?

1460
02:45:02,393 --> 02:45:04,224
God does nothing without
a reason.

1461
02:45:05,229 --> 02:45:07,925
We are the ones who rave
without rhyme or reason.

1462
02:45:08,299 --> 02:45:09,527
Oh, God!

1463
02:45:17,374 --> 02:45:19,433
You gave life to the thief.

1464
02:45:20,644 --> 02:45:23,272
A son born to a chaste mother died alone.

1465
02:45:25,082 --> 02:45:26,947
In raging floods, fell a banyan tree.

1466
02:45:28,285 --> 02:45:33,848
Sing songs of Earth heartily, you said.
I sing in praise and you're dead.

1467
02:45:36,594 --> 02:45:38,186
The maddened sea rocked a mountain.

1468
02:45:38,629 --> 02:45:41,427
Yours is a good death.
We live to decay and die.

1469
02:45:45,336 --> 02:45:47,531
My son. My son!

1470
02:45:52,476 --> 02:45:55,445
Try to understand.
Your son is dead 50 years ago.

1471
02:45:57,848 --> 02:46:01,181
Grandma, idol! The Lord.
- He isn't the one. Go away.

1472
02:46:03,254 --> 02:46:05,586
My son is there.
He's there.

1473
02:46:06,357 --> 02:46:09,292
The darkest skin, the fairiest heart.

1474
02:46:10,161 --> 02:46:12,925
You're the son of our warrior God.

1475
02:46:13,230 --> 02:46:16,063
Grandma, I can't take the deity
near a corpse.

1476
02:46:16,200 --> 02:46:20,830
What you said is true.
My son is dead!

1477
02:46:21,005 --> 02:46:23,838
No, he isn't your son.
Your son was fair-skinned

1478
02:46:24,041 --> 02:46:26,032
Fairest at heart.

1479
02:46:27,111 --> 02:46:31,949
It's the salt
and sunlight whatâ€™ve made him dark.

1480
02:46:31,949 --> 02:46:34,611
Don't touch. You don't know his caste.

1481
02:46:36,587 --> 02:46:38,145
Shut up, you fanatic!

1482
02:46:38,255 --> 02:46:40,450
He is my son.

1483
02:46:40,558 --> 02:46:44,460
The only son born to
Krishnaveni and Srinivasan.

1484
02:46:44,628 --> 02:46:47,097
Born in Uthiradam Star, Pieces.

1485
02:46:47,097 --> 02:46:51,466
He was born at 8 in the night,
the Lord takes him at 8 in the morning.

1486
02:46:52,136 --> 02:46:57,005
My dear, you forget there's an old woman
waiting for you?

1487
02:46:57,408 --> 02:46:59,171
In so many years,
you didn't even write a letter?

1488
02:46:59,276 --> 02:47:00,611
You kept sending me parcels.

1489
02:47:00,611 --> 02:47:01,976
Hold this for me,
Grandma.

1490
02:47:02,179 --> 02:47:05,444
Don't. It's 50 years of sadness.
Let her cry now.

1491
02:47:06,417 --> 02:47:09,318
Our savior...
He rescued my child.

1492
02:47:10,154 --> 02:47:13,351
If you're man enough,
touch his feet. Beg his pardon.

1493
02:47:15,292 --> 02:47:19,592
O, Lord, has my son reached
Your abode?

1494
02:47:19,897 --> 02:47:23,389
Take me there too.

1495
02:47:43,220 --> 02:47:44,517
Kalif Ullah!

1496
02:47:44,955 --> 02:47:48,356
If 200 of us had not been
in the mosque,

1497
02:47:48,893 --> 02:47:52,329
even we would be in heaven.

1498
02:47:53,264 --> 02:47:56,859
All by Allah's mercy.
- Allah is great!

1499
02:48:11,081 --> 02:48:13,606
Mr. Avaatar, you are safe.

1500
02:48:15,252 --> 02:48:18,221
Even our surgeons
couldn't have done a better job.

1501
02:48:18,455 --> 02:48:21,549
The bullet missed your voice box,
and took your cancerous growth.

1502
02:48:21,659 --> 02:48:24,890
Hereafter, only simple treatments
like chemotherapy will be needed.

1503
02:48:24,995 --> 02:48:26,121
Don't be afraid.

1504
02:48:32,102 --> 02:48:36,368
Look, your relatives have come.
Don't be afraid. Turn and see.

1505
02:48:38,108 --> 02:48:39,200
Take him closer.

1506
02:48:44,281 --> 02:48:48,809
You see. It's all His work.
- His work?

1507
02:48:49,987 --> 02:48:54,447
Thousand of corpses, his handwork?
- Your virus would have killed millions.

1508
02:48:54,658 --> 02:48:58,094
So, this is a change?
Fantastic.

1509
02:48:59,096 --> 02:49:04,864
8 millions years ago, God intentionally
let the tectonic plates glide.

1510
02:49:05,436 --> 02:49:08,405
So that he could save us with a tsunami
from the virus I make in 2004.

1511
02:49:10,641 --> 02:49:14,236
Instead, could He have stopped planting
such idea in scientist's minds?

1512
02:49:14,378 --> 02:49:19,611
Or He could have changed the minds of men
like Bush who financed this? Instead?

1513
02:49:20,617 --> 02:49:22,175
Oh, forget it!

1514
02:49:23,320 --> 02:49:26,483
Your grandma and your god,
just not there.

1515
02:49:26,957 --> 02:49:29,983
Look, I don't know what it is
but for some reason

1516
02:49:30,127 --> 02:49:35,155
God has created a kind of feeling for you.
- What kind?

1517
02:49:36,834 --> 02:49:38,995
Forget it.
- Forget what?

1518
02:49:39,136 --> 02:49:41,604
Don't argue like this!
- I'm arguing?

1519
02:49:41,839 --> 02:49:43,329
I don't like it when you say
things like there's no God.

1520
02:49:43,440 --> 02:49:46,136
Nothing of the sort will happen for us.
- What sort?

1521
02:49:46,310 --> 02:49:48,369
That's exactly what I don't like!
- What do you dislike?

1522
02:49:48,479 --> 02:49:52,108
If you argue over everything,
our lives will be in a mess.

1523
02:49:52,249 --> 02:49:57,121
Why should our lives be in a mess?
If God wills, he'll devise new designs.

1524
02:49:57,121 --> 02:50:02,218
There you go if ever again you
ridicule God or deny Him,

1525
02:50:02,326 --> 02:50:06,160
There's no way we'll come together.
Think and let me know.

1526
02:50:07,398 --> 02:50:10,629
What's there to think about?
We've come together.

1527
02:50:14,638 --> 02:50:15,605
We have got to be together.

1528
02:50:26,250 --> 02:50:30,277
But please never again say,
there's no God.

1529
02:50:32,956 --> 02:50:34,617
When did ever say,
there's no God.

1530
02:50:37,561 --> 02:50:39,188
It'll be good if there's one.

1531
02:50:40,164 --> 02:50:41,290
Accept the fact.

1532
02:51:06,256 --> 02:51:09,059
Until a majority attains rational logic.

1533
02:51:09,059 --> 02:51:11,926
The debate over the existence of God,
will continue.

1534
02:51:12,029 --> 02:51:15,332
Till then, I am only willing to accept

1535
02:51:15,332 --> 02:51:18,859
arguments honorable to human society.

1536
02:51:19,937 --> 02:51:22,906
I now invite the honorable Chief Minister
to make his speech.
