1
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,640
'No animals or birds were harmed
in the making of this film'

2
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,880
'All characters and incidents in this movie
bear no resemblance and are fictitious'

3
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,960
'In this movie, though some scenes
picturised various places in India...'

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,640
'...some important characters
been shown as speaking in Tamil'

5
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,200
Women's boxing is recent in
India, but...

6
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,120
...we're already hosting
the world championship

7
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,040
It's a historic event and I'm proud
to be in-charge

8
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,840
That is very big responsibility

9
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,640
I wake up early, finish all work,
wait for my husband to leave...

10
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,040
...travel 20 miles furtively to see you
and you treat me like shit!

11
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,080
Quit nagging

12
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,120
You're not my wife
Run along

13
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,800
Like how your wife
ran away with that boxer?

14
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,800
Mr Prabhu, how's it working under
Mr Dev Khatri again...

15
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,280
...post the notorious standoff in 1996?

16
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,280
Ma'am, that's old news

17
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,120
He apologized
and I accepted

18
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,160
Let it go

19
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,160
Why are there very few champions
in a population of a billion?

20
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,440
We won a bronze last year and...

21
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,720
Kill the politics in boxing and
you'll find a champion every street

22
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,040
Mr Prabhu, you're known
to be temperamental

23
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,840
 How's it handling girls?

24
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,320
Am I running a brothel?

25
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,880
How dare he speaks
to a lady like this?

26
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,760
What kind of daft shit is,
'handling girls'?

27
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,440
Keep the footwork light
Bloody elephant

28
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,880
That's a foul!

29
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,640
Give me the speed with which you
chomp free mutton

30
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,480
Block her punches

31
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,440
Stop

32
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,880
Get into the ring Mr Know-it-all

33
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,680
Sorry
Now move it

34
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,760
Block...block...block

35
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,480
Red is the winner

36
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,680
She's no boxer at all
Stop gloating

37
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,200
Lose that flab first

38
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,440
You've no ringside discipline
Quiet!

39
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,720
The Association's gone to the dogs
thanks to your 'quiet'

40
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,960
Speak up man!

41
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,600
Sir, you're wanted
by the committee

42
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,160
Urgent meeting, sir

43
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,400
The students have
complained against you

44
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,960
A sexual harassment complaint

45
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,360
Get to the point

46
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,840
We've started an enquiry committee and
till the report's out, you're suspended

47
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,880
What crap!

48
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,080
- How dare you come with a beer?
- Why do you meet when I'm drinking?

49
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,440
Don't waste my time

50
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:30,080
Our girls are feeling unsafe
Married women come to your flat

51
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,920
What's it to you
what I do in my home?

52
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,800
My wife ran away 'cos I was
a failure due to your politics...

53
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,280
...now I'll sleep with anyone

54
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Your wife, his wife, prostitutes
But I never touch my students

55
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,440
I don't select boxers
in a bedroom like you

56
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,480
I select them in the ring

57
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,160
This should be against you
Four screwballs heading a committee!

58
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,240
Shut up!

59
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,280
This is committee meeting
Behave yourself!

60
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,320
You can't take action based on
an anonymous letter

61
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:11,840
Okay, forget suspension, but I'm
answerable to my superiors

62
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,440
- We'll transfer him to Chennai
- To Chennai?

63
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,440
Nonsense!

64
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,240
What will he do there?
There are no boxers or facilities

65
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,560
He is a no 1 Coach

66
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,440
He boasts of creating
champions from nothing

67
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,360
Let him create one there

68
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,800
I should've castrated you in 1996
and saved women's boxing

69
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,560
Send me to Chennai or Timabktoo
I'll create a champion and show you!

70
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,440
'THE FINAL ROUND'

71
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,120
"Scorching anger, blazing heart"

72
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,040
"My gaze turns asunder
the many obstacles in my path"

73
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:02,360
"Dreaded visage, boiling blood,
A furnace with a blazing pace"

74
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:09,600
"I'm not a slave to fall at your feet
Self-respect's my strength"

75
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,560
"I don't need to hide in fear,
my heart's laid bare"

76
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,880
"No way can you stop me
No handcuff can bridle me"

77
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,560
"Get the hell out of my way
Go on buggers 'Cos I fear none"

78
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,520
 "Raging ire
Fuels the fire"

79
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,480
" My veins coil
to form a wheel"

80
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,880
"Daring heart would me to go"

81
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,440
"My pace would topple the sun"

82
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,520
"Road-wheel would take up a fight"

83
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,720
"But would buckle to my might"

84
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:11,800
"No way can you stop me
No handcuff can bridle me"

85
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,760
"Get the hell out of my way
Go on buggers 'Cos I fear no one"

86
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,280
"Am a toughie,
no trouble scares me"

87
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,040
"Am ready to tread on rough roads"

88
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,360
"Fright is not in my dictionary"

89
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,120
"Think of nothing but boxing"

90
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:52,320
"Walkers don't dare
Am a flyer"

91
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:59,440
"No way can you stop me
No handcuff can bridle me"

92
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,000
"Get the hell out of my way
Go on buggers 'Cos I fear no one"

93
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,160
I spend shit-loads to welcome him
and the bugger doesn't come!

94
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,080
Prabhu sir, welcome

95
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,000
You're late

96
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,680
We put up quite a show
The girls expected you

97
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,200
Senior 'Coch'? Boxing 'Loin'?
What's this crap?

98
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,800
That's how we do it! Birth, death,
weddings, honeymoon...

99
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,440
...attaining puberty
everything gets a banner!

100
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,560
We are our person
Won't I do this much for you?

101
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,640
- Punch Pandian Junior coach
- And you'll always remain a junior coach

102
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,520
At least you're on time for the zonals
Come, I'll introduce my champs!

103
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,880
Sir, my girls!

104
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,320
Gayatri, come here

105
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,440
Come

106
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,480
Gayatri's boxing for five years
Slept with Coach Innocent to get here

107
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,480
Abirami, Melody Jaya are all useless
Shakti's here only for a railways job

108
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,200
Nobody's serious about boxing
No spark in them

109
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,240
So use your spark
to ignite them!

110
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,120
Chill, sir
Stop criticising my girls

111
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,280
They are good fighters

112
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,840
Just feed them and watch!

113
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,520
Like Tsunami

114
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,360
I'll introduce my star, Luxmi

115
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,280
Lux's here just for a police job
No spark, just soap suds in this 'Lux'

116
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,560
Move
Move

117
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,480
Go slow

118
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,680
Quiet!

119
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,400
What the hell are you doing?

120
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,040
Quiet!

121
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,120
Madhi, watch out

122
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,600
Idiots, you're late

123
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,880
Why late?
Hurry up

124
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,800
Are you happy
with the facilities?

125
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,520
Next round boxer come to the ring

126
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,920
Don't you remember me?

127
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,640
I'm Innocent
Why are you quiet?

128
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,320
Do you have any problem?

129
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,880
- Do you know a lawyer?
- Of course sir

130
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,480
- Why?
- I want to file a case

131
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,560
Against whom?

132
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,840
Against your pop,
for producing you

133
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,880
Having your tummy
like a punching bag, get lost

134
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,240
Luxmi, red
Vijaya, blue

135
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,520
First round

136
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,560
Box

137
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,360
Break her ribs

138
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,280
Just do

139
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,240
Punch her

140
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,160
Soooperb, my dear

141
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,240
That's it

142
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,440
Hurry! Madhi sister got the victory

143
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,960
'No one opposite
Lux is the best'

144
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,480
Results about # 2

145
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,040
Winning on the points,
blue is the winner

146
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,520
Blue?

147
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,280
Referee, you slope
to them for money?

148
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,680
Grandpa, what's happening?

149
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,280
I should've won

150
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,880
- You don't worry
- Referee, what's this sir?

151
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,000
You are not supposed to do like this
as no one dares questioning you

152
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,800
Sir, they've cheated
Please go ask them

153
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,480
Aren't you the new coachie?
Stop faffing and ask them

154
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,360
When the opponent's dad's an official
A knockout works...

155
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,640
...not pussyfooting

156
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,240
Come on sir,
Lux fought well!

157
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,600
Go and ask them, sir

158
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,520
Bullshit! The ring
isn't for pansies

159
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,600
These are only fit to wash clothes

160
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,960
You dog...Damn cheat
I'll kill you!

161
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,840
I'll break your teeth

162
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,720
You curly hair
Get this blow

163
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,240
Are you supporting him?

164
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,840
If you give mixed results
I'll kill you

165
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,000
Take your hands off me

166
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,600
Madhi! Listen to me
Don't do like mad

167
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,680
Let's go

168
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,360
Listen to me, Madhi!

169
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,200
I'll be nice
Promise

170
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,520
What do know about boxing?

171
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,040
How dare you cheat us?

172
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,400
- Leave me
- Madhi, let him go

173
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,480
Is this how you cheat the poor?

174
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,720
Please use your
power and help

175
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,520
Why should I help?

176
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,360
I wash my ass not others

177
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,240
Junior! Where can I get a drink?

178
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,480
Sir, are you divorced?

179
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,280
Nope
She dumped me!

180
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,160
Terrible
I feel bad for you

181
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,880
Did I cry to you?

182
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,840
A married man has one wife
A bachelor has many wives!

183
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,080
You're a dude!

184
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:30,000
My wife and boxing
were my world

185
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,560
I never looked at another woman
Not like now

186
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:43,120
She wanted me to win the '96
Olympic gold so bad

187
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,880
I won the selections easily...

188
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,600
...but my bloody coach

189
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,720
Dev played dirty...

190
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,440
...and sent another
boxer instead of me

191
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,960
I missed the Olympic gold medal

192
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,000
And My wife ran away with another boxer

193
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,960
Your story's so sad

194
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,240
Women are-

195
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,920
Hey, who's boxing?

196
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,440
Stinky drunk, get home!

197
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,200
Hey Pandi

198
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,400
Who was boxing there?

199
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,640
Wretch Madhi

200
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,680
She's the devil
who thrashed the judges

201
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,000
She'll kill you too

202
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,160
Buy fish, sir...fish...fish

203
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,320
Iyer's favourite, Mackerel fish
Film director Sankar's favourite, Red snapper

204
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,880
Today special
Come on

205
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,600
Fish
Fish

206
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,400
Is the fish fresh?

207
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,800
Don't squeeze it
like it's your wife

208
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,880
I'll chop you up
Piss off!

209
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,280
Girls are only fit to
'wash clothes' huh?

210
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,960
I'll punch you so bad, you won't have
a mouth to smoke with!

211
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,040
Hey move man

212
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,640
- Where did you learn boxing?
- Why?

213
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,280
Where did you learn boxing?

214
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,080
Bugger off

215
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,640
You can't seduce me
with corny lines

216
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,400
Get out

217
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,760
Where did you learn boxing?

218
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,800
Stop repeating yourself,
senile old goat

219
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,160
The foul mouthed devil
sells stolen fish

220
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,800
Come here

221
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:32,160
Go, Miss World is calling you
What a perfect couple!

222
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,400
Sister

223
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,600
Sister! Come and
buy some fish

224
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,200
My dead fish will die seeing
your ugly mug! Beat it!

225
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,560
Here it

226
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,560
Now tell me
Where did you learn boxing?

227
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,840
Okay, but one condition

228
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,640
What?

229
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,000
First shove it up your ass

230
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,880
Sister...Sister

231
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,600
Sister

232
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,160
Come to the gym

233
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,600
Two hours, morning
and evening

234
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,160
I'll teach you boxing and pay you
500 bucks per day

235
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,080
Old man! Muhammad Ali taught me!

236
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,800
Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee

237
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,520
Make sure you bathe
You stink!

238
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,760
Lux! Look!

239
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,760
Look it

240
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,040
You sold all the fish!

241
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,800
The crazy coachie promised
500 per day if I go to him

242
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,840
Bastard

243
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,160
- I'll kill him
- Idiot! He called me to train

244
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,840
Pandian says he's a womaniser
Did you agree?

245
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,200
He's no George Clooney that
I'd fall for him!

246
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,640
Imagine, 500 bucks everyday!

247
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,200
We'll get poor mom
a new saree...

248
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:28,600
...Nike shoes for you and
eat chicken curry finally!

249
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,680
Bugger, give it back!

250
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,840
Respect your father

251
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,200
Look at Lux
She's like me, peaceful

252
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,760
This one's like you
A barking orangutan!

253
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,080
Return it Samikannu

254
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,520
I'm not Samikannu anymore

255
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,720
I'll box your ears

256
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,880
Now my name's Samuel!

257
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,640
Samu

258
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,600
What Samuel?

259
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,120
Did you convert for money?
Oh God!

260
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:10,360
Jesus, forgive these sinners
Damayanti, you're Diana from today!

261
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,480
Honor the Father and the Mother

262
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,640
Amen!

263
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,440
Madhi's Madonna from today!

264
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,800
Mom, leave him

265
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,320
Devils! My mom told me not
to marry a north Indian!

266
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,280
I am not listen that

267
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,880
Hey devils

268
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,480
"She dances to the flutter
of the 500 notes"

269
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,000
"To a rhythm of the fish
bubbling in the curry"

270
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,480
"Hell bent on fulfilling
every dream"

271
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,840
"The little queen reaches
for the pinnacle"

272
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,000
"She'll grab everything
she can"

273
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,840
"And not a soul
dare stop her"

274
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,920
"Come boss come"

275
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,600
"She'll get the better
of you every time"

276
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,880
"Like a match stick
that'll burn you each time"

277
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,000
"Come boss come"

278
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:40,720
"Their daily struggles rise
and ebb with the tide"

279
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,200
"But she rides life with smiles"

280
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,360
"Astride like a queen she reigns"

281
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,960
"Come boss come"

282
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,640
"She'll get the better
of you every time"

283
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,320
"Like a match stick
that'll burn you each time"

284
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,960
"Come boss come"

285
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,120
"Yov, what do you think?"

286
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,360
"Come boss come"

287
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,920
"She'll get the better
of you every time"

288
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,960
"Like a match stick that'll
burn you each time"

289
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,680
"Come boss come"

290
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,720
How the door has been opened?

291
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,240
Thieves again?
Who's up there?

292
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,560
Just a tad late!

293
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,320
He said the girls are useless
What's got into him now?

294
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,880
What time is it?

295
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,000
I got late

296
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,680
I'm asking you why?

297
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,360
I just got late

298
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,000
You're mine for the two hours
You'll obey me

299
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,480
You'll call me 'Master'
even in your dreams

300
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,240
If you break a rule, I'll kill you

301
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,800
What?

302
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,200
Can I pee or
do you dictate that too?

303
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,160
Warm up!

304
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,360
Nice comedy

305
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,680
One maniac's gonna train the other!
Knock out for boxing

306
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,960
Hey, move man

307
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,920
50 done! Next?

308
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,840
- Where are your shoes?
- A moment master

309
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,600
Lux! Give me your shoes

310
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,560
I'll return it to you
after the training

311
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,680
Quick

312
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,840
Go out

313
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,640
- How many punches are there in boxing?
- I know all that!

314
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,480
Come here

315
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,520
Stay away! I've been learning since
I was 4 years...

316
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,040
...from the Muhammad Ali
I've seen all his fights

317
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,880
What did you learn?

318
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,600
Lots! Just keep punching
till your opponent's out!

319
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,040
Jab, cross, hook, upper cut
Only four punches

320
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:19,120
- I just didn't know the names
- Oh? So show me

321
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,640
Use the body's full power to punch

322
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,520
Don't you dare come close

323
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,360
Get it straight! I'm not
interested in your body

324
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,240
You're not getting it
even if you crawl

325
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,560
- Hey, Santhosh
- Master

326
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,320
Finish her off

327
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,280
Show me your technique

328
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,120
Hey Muhammad Ali's disciple
It's not a street fight

329
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,120
Come one...get up

330
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,280
UP!

331
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,160
Use your head
Get it?

332
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,800
- Go do push-ups
- I just did 50!

333
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:43,760
Are you here to box or do math?
What's 50? 'Do it till you die'

334
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,080
'Do it till you die'

335
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,240
Your guru ALI said that, not me

336
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,800
- I'm off
- Where to?

337
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,440
Our deal's for two hours
Beyond that you pay extra

338
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,400
See you

339
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,120
"With fire in her eyes.."

340
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,240
"She delivers killer blows"

341
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:16,480
"Fatal punches.."

342
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,800
What's so funny?

343
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,240
Go

344
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,600
- I hear Prabhu's got a new boxer?
- She's just a fishmonger

345
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,440
She takes his money and abuses him

346
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,080
It's a big joke

347
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,160
It's not funny
Keep an eye on them

348
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,200
Got it?

349
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,400
Okay sir

350
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:47,960
"Face the moment...Rev up your heart
Kick the obstacles in your path"

351
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:55,840
"Open your mind...Open your heart
Unleash the magical force"

352
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,080
"Magical force"

353
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,000
"Magical force"

354
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,720
"Magical force"

355
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,600
"Magical force"

356
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,120
Go

357
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,680
You made me wait yesterday
So I set my own time today

358
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:34,920
"Waves of dreams never reach
the shores unless you strive"

359
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:42,360
"Boundaries drawn by your heart,
will be wiped away by your drive"

360
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,720
"The magical force will propel you,"

361
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,560
"The magical force will carry you"

362
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,720
"The magical force will sustain you!"

363
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,920
"Magical force"

364
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,560
Don't mess with me...
I'm a boxer now

365
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,000
Mind it

366
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,400
You scoundrels!

367
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,600
Leave me

368
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:39,160
"Heights you've never dreamt of are
yours, just go for them"

369
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,000
"You walk despite the pain,
you're a brave-heart"

370
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,200
"You stop in fear, you've
just died a small death"

371
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:54,960
"Fight fear, fight to the forefront,
unleash the tornado"

372
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:02,800
"And till the last round, harden your heart,
you will catapult into eternity"

373
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,600
"The magical force will propel you"

374
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,640
"The magical force will carry you"

375
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,640
"The magical force will sustain you!"

376
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,840
"Magical force"

377
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,280
What the hell are you doing, Madhi?

378
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,920
Good Madhi!

379
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:30,400
For a pudgy middle aged guy,
you're smile's hot!

380
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,640
Smart ass!

381
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,720
Is this all you know after eight years?

382
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,480
Learn from her

383
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,000
If you're not interested,
get the hell out

384
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,400
Hey, Lux

385
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,440
Why are you always being like this...?

386
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,120
If Master trained me personally,
I'd win too

387
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,520
Don't worry
He knows you're the best

388
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,200
He'll train you

389
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,400
Eat up

390
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,120
Trust me

391
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,560
No! Let mom have it

392
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,880
I'm 24! It's my last shot
at the police job

393
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,360
I found a boxer
I've never seen one like her

394
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,280
Do you remember me
as an orphan in street fights?

395
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,400
She's exactly like
how I was as a teen

396
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,880
Like you? Throw her out
or you'll regret it

397
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,680
She's better than me
Instinctive defence, superb speed...

398
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,720
...Dominating body language
and footwork like dance!

399
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,680
- So?
- She's a born champ

400
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,440
I've never heard you
praise a boxer! Train her

401
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,560
Make sure ready her
coming World Championship

402
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,560
I've handled Dev
You can return soon

403
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:05,560
Will you come to see her in
the Association Cup next week?

404
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,680
Of course!

405
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,160
Sir...Sir

406
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:21,480
I thought you're a horny dog, a dastard
I was wrong

407
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,800
Sorry, sir

408
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,520
You chase talent, not skirts

409
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,720
Salute!

410
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,400
Bugger, are you praising or abusing me?

411
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,600
Honesty doesn't pay
I'll shut up!

412
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,080
Get me liver

413
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,720
How much liver will you eat,
you old geezer? You'll die

414
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:48,040
It's a health funda
Let me tell you a secret

415
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,240
Booze ruins our liver

416
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,640
But if you eat liver while drinking,
then this liver rots...

417
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,440
...and our liver stays safe!

418
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,520
Got it?

419
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,600
Come on

420
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,600
Haven't I told you to
not lower your guard?

421
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,080
Stop staring
Come on!

422
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,920
Howzat! Southpaw

423
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,520
Muhammad Ali
She's a goner!

424
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,480
Super dude

425
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,040
You rocked it

426
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,520
Up! How dare you lower your guard?

427
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,480
You switch from right to
left and think you're Ali?

428
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,480
First get the basics

429
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:51,880
You touch me again, I'll chop
you and feed fish

430
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,120
- Respect Madhi! I'm your coach
- Screw you and your coaching

431
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,520
You're not paying me to be mauled

432
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,320
Take your sister along

433
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,920
Tell her you've
ruined her career

434
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,000
Get lost

435
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,880
Hey, Madhi

436
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:25,160
The poor girls face hell everywhere
Be kind to them

437
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,880
Quit interfering or I'll slipper you!

438
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,400
I don't want them to end up
cleaning toilets like you

439
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,640
Yes, I clean shit

440
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,920
 But you stink

441
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,960
What a vile tongue!

442
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,320
You're a bad man

443
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,320
From now, the tournament's your life

444
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,240
Train eight hours a day
and do what I say

445
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,120
Forget your homes and lovers!
Get it duffers?

446
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,720
Take your sister along

447
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,360
Tell her you've ruined her career

448
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,080
Okay...enough
All the best

449
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,720
- Thank you sir
- Carry on

450
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,760
- All the best
- Thank you sir

451
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,760
All the best

452
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,920
Thank you sir

453
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,440
Is that her?

454
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,280
Don't leave her

455
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,760
That's it

456
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,600
Punch her

457
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,600
Yes...punch like that

458
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,760
Stop

459
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,680
Great fight!
Remove head guard

460
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,800
Winning on points, Red's the winner

461
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,640
You're into the next round, right?

462
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,200
Now watch

463
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,240
Huh?

464
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,920
We need glucose

465
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,920
- Take it
- Thank you, sir

466
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,840
Playing Santa again?

467
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,360
Save up or you'll land up
penniless in the garbage bin

468
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,120
If you were a cute baby
someone would adopt you

469
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,720
But you're a nasty bull

470
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,800
TRUE

471
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,640
Focus Madhi

472
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,320
Thiya is Red
Madhi is Blue

473
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,480
First round

474
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,160
Box

475
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,600
Break

476
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,240
Move

477
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,960
What?

478
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,320
Blue, foul

479
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,280
Blue disqualified

480
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:28,160
- Crazy girl, why did you hit him?
- Now he'll train you alone

481
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,360
She isn't like you
She's worse

482
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,600
Kick her out

483
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,360
I want Madhi for
the National selections in Dharamsala

484
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,880
- I'll take both the girls
- Hey cupcake, who's this gigolo?

485
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,200
Is he matching your complexion?

486
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,480
He's Lux's coachie

487
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,520
He wants to take
the girls with him

488
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,160
Coachie
I disapprove

489
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,320
She supports them

490
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,000
They resemble the hag
with those bruised faces

491
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,360
Who'll marry them? Tell me

492
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,880
My work has finished here

493
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I've been transferred to Hisar

494
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,240
I won't return again

495
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,240
After me, no one will
give a shit about them

496
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,640
They are good boxers

497
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,480
They'll stay in the hostel in my care
Think and tell me

498
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,920
Who'll feed us if Madhi goes?

499
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,200
I'll send money every month

500
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,520
Coachie, give it to the family's boss!

501
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,200
Jesus, bless the coachie!

502
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,040
What did that dastard want?

503
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,880
Stop shouting

504
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,400
He wants you to stay with
him, so you'll focus

505
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,600
With him? No way

506
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,560
He'll kill me

507
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,520
Why?

508
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:59,120
I starved to make Lux a boxer
Don't ruin it

509
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,680
If Lux is a cop, we get respect
I won't send her alone

510
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,960
Go take care of her
Understand?

511
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,840
Where is that old man?

512
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,240
Hey, move

513
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,920
Do we look like whores?
How dare you come home?

514
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,920
You want us both in your bed

515
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,400
Isn't that your plan, you pervert?

516
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,760
How dare you create
a problem in my shop?

517
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,440
Get out

518
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,240
- Get out
- Leave me

519
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,640
Get out

520
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,640
Come in

521
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,920
Don't break my bike

522
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:06,160
- Leave my bike alone!
- It's not yours! It's his

523
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,600
I'll break your mouth

524
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,840
Now it's mine! He splurged
on equipment for you...

525
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,760
...and gave his bike as payment
Can you pay me?

526
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,600
I don't know what
the fool sees in you filthy pigs

527
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,760
Pay for the damage
or I'll call the police

528
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,080
Let her go

529
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,160
I hate him more than you do

530
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:50,000
You think he's after your body

531
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,960
You're wrong

532
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,520
He can get a beauty for half
the money he gives you

533
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,200
He always gave you the best

534
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:07,960
He emptied his pockets
for your training

535
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,720
We saw you as a foul fishmonger

536
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,920
But he saw your talent

537
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,840
He trusts you

538
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,920
Madhi

539
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,800
Think before you decide

540
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,600
'I'm not interested in your body'

541
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,440
'You're not getting it even if you crawl'

542
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:19,280
"Hey fighter, your big eyes are
pouncing on my soul dear"

543
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:24,520
"Stop the play of fists"

544
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:29,440
"And start the play of the lips"

545
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:34,400
"I ache to chase away the loneliness"

546
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:39,240
"Open your heart and
make me your princess"

547
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:46,640
"I'll find you, I'll hug you,
and I'll make you mine"

548
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,760
"Oh yes I will!"

549
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:56,600
"Will hover around you, will take
you into me, and make you mine"

550
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,640
"Oh yes I will!"

551
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:28,320
"Oh my handsome enemy,
I walked far away from you"

552
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:37,880
"But I don't know when I walked towards you
For when I woke up, I'm inside you"

553
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:43,000
"What spell did you cast and tie me up?"

554
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:49,040
"I wrote myself into a book, you just
tore away my diffidence"

555
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:55,920
"I'll find you, I'll hug you,
and I'll make you mine"

556
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,880
"Oh yes I will!"

557
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,840
"Will hover around you, will take
you into me, and make you mine"

558
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,080
"Oh yes I will!"

559
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:19,160
"Like a tiny boat in a stream,
love floats in me like a dream"

560
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:28,680
"When I see you, my soul
rolls out to reach you"

561
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:33,680
"Don't you pity me? Look at me please
Don't ignore me"

562
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:39,160
"Throw a look and watch crazy me"

563
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,840
Take it
Master's calling you

564
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,240
Come fast

565
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,800
Not you
Just Madhi

566
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,640
Wait Lux...I'll come

567
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,760
"I ache to chase away the loneliness"

568
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:03,760
"Open your heart and
make me your princess"

569
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:11,200
"I'll find you, I'll hug you, and
I'll make you mine"

570
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,400
"Oh yes I will!"

571
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:21,000
"Will hover around you, will take
you into me, and make you mine"

572
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,920
"Oh yes I will!"

573
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:38,400
Master, we've a bet going
Is Tyson your idol or Ali?

574
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,680
Genghis Khan

575
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,680
A Pakistani boxer? Heavy weight?

576
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:48,000
Idiot, he was a king, not a boxer!

577
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:54,120
Genghis Khan was just a puny guy

578
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,520
A Mongolian

579
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,480
But what guts!

580
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,320
He conquered Asia easily
but the Europeans were formidable

581
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:08,680
They were huge with strong armours

582
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,800
A head-on confrontation was impossible
So what did he do?

583
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,320
He knew the enemy's strength
lay in his weapons

584
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:20,040
To win, one has to destroy the enemy's
weapons or strengthen one's own

585
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,520
He did both

586
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,880
To destroy their armoury, he invented
the 'Composite Bow'

587
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,160
While fighting, he feigned retreat...

588
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,880
...unexpectedly turned around and
shot at them from a speeding horse

589
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,440
The enemy was vanquished

590
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,440
If you wreck an enemy's weapons,
how will he fight?

591
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,000
But how's this connected to boxing?

592
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,360
The day you get it, you'll be selected

593
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,920
Shut up

594
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,760
I'm going back to Hisar

595
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,960
I'll take only one boxer for
the World Cup selections

596
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,880
- Wish you all the best
- Thank you master

597
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,440
Be brave

598
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,200
All the best

599
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,800
Don't mess it up

600
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,480
Red corner Luxmi

601
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,600
Blue corner Anju

602
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,200
First round...box

603
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,600
Stop

604
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,320
To the corner

605
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,480
Unanimous decision
Blue's the winner

606
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,960
Don't cry

607
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,440
Seconds out
Fourth round

608
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,040
Damn! What are you doing here?

609
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,040
- Fish curry! I made it
- Thanks Madhi

610
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,880
Do I look good?

611
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,720
Put on tracks and get in the ring

612
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:17,240
- Why? Don't I look good?
- You look butt ugly

613
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,680
You're beautiful to me when you fight
hard with that ugly mouth guard

614
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,880
Come on, let's go

615
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:24,880
Come, it is late

616
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,040
Don't lie master
I know you like me

617
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,400
I love you, master

618
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,680
- Huh?
- I love you

619
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,240
It's normal to get
distracted at your age

620
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,800
You're not the first student to say it

621
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,080
It is normal
Forget it

622
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,960
But you've said I'm unique

623
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,560
Madhi, focus
I'm your dad's age

624
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,960
I know many men my dad's age
I don't profess love to them

625
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,440
What the hell do
I do if I've fallen for you?

626
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,360
It's my first, I'm not scared
Why are you?

627
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,120
You must've said it to many
Tell me also or I'll throw the fight

628
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,480
Concentrate on boxing

629
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,880
Selections aren't a joke
Go train, moron

630
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,840
I'm not kidding

631
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,880
What's with that stupid grin?

632
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,680
- Tell me
- Nothing!

633
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,320
Are you crazy?
Madhi, you're on next!

634
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,000
Show me your hand

635
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,920
Give her the first-aid

636
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,200
Wrap it up tight
I'll manage

637
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,560
Blue corner, Madhi

638
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,880
Red corner, Dhiksha

639
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,040
First round

640
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,920
Box

641
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,560
Madhi, raise your guard

642
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,960
Raise your guard, idiot!

643
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,560
You shouldn't have chosen her
She's throwing the match

644
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,680
Stop

645
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,800
Unanimous decision
Red is the winner

646
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,240
I didn't do it on purpose

647
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,800
Master, please...

648
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:23,760
How much ever you pamper
a stray dog, it will only eat shit

649
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:29,680
When you're about to achieve big,
all you think of is getting laid

650
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,320
I'm a bloody fool...

651
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:39,560
...I thought you'd become a champion
and achieve what I couldn't

652
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,240
Get lost!

653
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,120
Crawl back to your filth

654
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,360
Die

655
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,640
Don't beat yourself up
At least Lux's made it

656
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,800
Oh She's a devil
She has no emotions

657
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,000
- And you do?
- Shut up!

658
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:06,040
We helped the coachie earn blessings
by taking his monthly Rs 3000 dole

659
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,440
- She has ruined that too
- Shut up you creep!

660
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,240
The things will happen as fate decides

661
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:17,200
You are to blame
The moment I touched you was inauspicious

662
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,360
Is she my sperm?

663
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,200
Madhi! What are you doing?

664
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,840
What are you doing?

665
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,160
Hey, let her go

666
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:42,120
It's my fault that I was smitten by white
skin and married you...damn North Indian!

667
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,920
Don't act smart with me

668
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:51,480
"You prick with a needle
the very nerves of my life and breath"

669
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:58,840
"You lay my heart down and
shroud it with a white cloth"

670
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:06,440
"Don't make my eyes search
so desperately for you"

671
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:13,640
"Don't stoke the flames with your
absence and burn me down"

672
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:21,360
"Don't ignore me and extinguish my breath"

673
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:28,760
"Don't finish me off, 'cos I've
come here despite myself"

674
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:41,000
"My broken smile lies scattered in pieces
when will you come to gather it?"

675
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:48,480
"My heart is shattered with your memories,
please make me yours"

676
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:06,480
"I ran in the direction from where I got
the smell of your heart"

677
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:14,080
"In the storm around, I searched for
the breath that would lead me to you"

678
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:21,480
"I searched for you"

679
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:28,400
"Don't make my eyes search
so desperately for you"

680
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:36,200
"Don't stoke the flames with your
absence and burn me down"

681
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:43,120
"Don't ignore me and extinguish my breath"

682
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:51,000
"Don't finish me off, 'cos I've
come here despite myself"

683
00:59:55,120 --> 01:00:02,800
"My broken smile lies scattered in pieces
when will you come to gather it?"

684
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:09,400
"My heart is shattered with your memories,
please make me yours"

685
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:20,200
Tell her I'm making her fight
in the Cultural exchange tournament...

686
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,680
...and send her to Delhi
Got it?

687
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,720
Okay, sir

688
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,320
Sure, sir
I'll put her on the list

689
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,240
Okay, sir

690
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,440
Thank you, sir

691
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,960
Dev's reeling in the fishmonger!

692
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,680
My dear Madhi!

693
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,800
The Associations called you back
You're going to Delhi

694
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,800
You are going to fight in
the Cultural exchange tournament

695
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:48,800
Dev Khatris recommended you
for the tournament

696
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,320
Hey, our Madhi is going to Delhi

697
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,440
Madhi! Be ready to
show your boxing there

698
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,960
Aren't you Prabhu's student?

699
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,640
You wanna experience
international boxing?

700
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,760
Wanna fight the Russian, Natalia?

701
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,360
Sir, the Russians in a heavier category
but madhi fights light weight category

702
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:15,600
Did you win Asian Games gold in 1980?

703
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,760
Or get National sports award
'Arjuna award' in 1990?

704
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,040
 Or get 'Dronacharya Award' in 1996
for your excellence coaching?

705
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,400
I'm confused as to who is
the National head coach now

706
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:32,200
She's a higher weight category
Will you fight or not?

707
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,280
I never said I wouldn't

708
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,400
Good

709
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,280
That's the spirit!
Get ready

710
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,040
Anyway you'll lose

711
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,640
You can't beat her

712
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,280
Just go swing your arms

713
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,720
Shake hands
Red, Blue

714
01:01:59,040 --> 01:01:59,960
Box

715
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,600
1...

716
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,200
2...

717
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:21,840
3...

718
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,040
4...

719
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,240
5...

720
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,480
6...

721
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,800
7...

722
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,200
8...

723
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:29,720
9...

724
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:30,680
10...

725
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:31,600
Knock out!

726
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,560
Red is the winner

727
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,440
Get up, Madhi

728
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,200
Dirty dog!

729
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,480
Dev sir wants you

730
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:27,800
Come in

731
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,440
Some in
and sit

732
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,560
Does it hurt?

733
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,080
Close the door

734
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,760
Don't feel bad about losing

735
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,880
You're talented

736
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,440
I tried, sir

737
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,280
Don't worry

738
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,160
Forget it

739
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,560
I gave you this chance

740
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,560
I'll make you represent India next

741
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,000
Come close to me

742
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:22,880
That's the end of your career, bitch

743
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:34,800
Why are you glaring at me?
Like you didn't do it with Prabhu sir

744
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:39,120
Shut up
Master never touched me

745
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:43,280
No wonder he dumped you!
Talent alone isn't enough

746
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,760
Ask Lux

747
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,840
Break it...faster

748
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,760
That's my locker

749
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,560
Move aside

750
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,080
From where did you get this money?

751
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:30,640
Did you steal it from the Association?

752
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:31,720
I didn't steal

753
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:39,360
You'll never box again
Don't mess with Dev

754
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,240
Come

755
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:42,160
What happened, madam?

756
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:43,960
I didn't steal it
I'm being framed

757
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,640
- Why are you taking her?
- Come and talk to me in the station?

758
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:47,400
Move

759
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:54,880
"I ran in the direction from where I got
the smell of your heart"

760
01:05:55,400 --> 01:06:02,600
"In the storm around, I searched for
the breath that would lead me to you"

761
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,640
"I searched for you"

762
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,800
"I searched for you"

763
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:17,200
"Don't make my eyes search
so desperately for you"

764
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:24,920
"Don't stoke the flames with your
absence and burn me down"

765
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:31,840
"Don't ignore me and extinguish my breath"

766
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:39,080
"Don't finish me off, 'cos I've
come here despite myself"

767
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:51,600
"My broken smile lies scattered in pieces
when will you come to gather it?"

768
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:58,400
"My heart is shattered with your memories,
please make me yours"

769
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:04,440
Master, I messed up
Forgive me

770
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,680
Please, master

771
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,240
Please help me

772
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,840
Don't hit her
Please leave

773
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,320
I am to blame, master

774
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,280
All I want is to box, I swear
Master, save me

775
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,280
Take that phone from her

776
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,920
Master, please

777
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:35,320
Had you waited, the inspector
would've agreed to a smaller bribe

778
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,320
I'd have paid double if required

779
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:42,640
Move aside

780
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,440
Sir...sir

781
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:46,840
Remember?

782
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:50,080
'Why should I help?'

783
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:53,920
'I wash my ass,
not others' ass'

784
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:56,560
Sir!

785
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,480
You're a good man

786
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,240
Forget the past

787
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,560
It's okay if you
haven't won a qualifier...

788
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:35,280
...you win the trials, you'll go
to the World Championship

789
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:39,440
Focus on boxing
I'll take care of the rest

790
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:40,880
Yes, master

791
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,200
Hi, master

792
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,120
Come, Madhi

793
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,200
Give me your bag

794
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,640
I'll carry it
My hand's fine now

795
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,520
I'll shift your roommate to other room

796
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:27,120
Madhi can stay with you

797
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,200
I'll be fine on my own

798
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,240
The lech

799
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:58,040
 He's obsessed!
What've you done to him?

800
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:10,280
And your 'innocent' look?
Teach me too

801
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:17,760
Why the hell do you have to box?

802
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,520
I should've broken
your hand for good

803
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,200
I know you did it
But, did I question you?

804
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,640
I fought with a broken
hand and was trashed

805
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,080
Did I tattle?

806
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,520
I worked my ass off
for you guys

807
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:40,120
What about all that I've done?
I can't even talk about it

808
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:46,720
Had I got the police job, I'd have
sorted your lives too

809
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:52,480
If you'd said 'don't box',
I would've given it up

810
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:57,720
But now I'll box for me and
for the man who believes in me

811
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,240
You want boxing?

812
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,240
You'll box huh?

813
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,440
Are you able to do boxing now?

814
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,480
Will you do boxing again?

815
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:07,840
Lux, leave her alone!

816
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,080
Stop it
Stop

817
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:12,680
Hey stop

818
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,000
Are you mad?

819
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,760
Go to your room

820
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:25,080
Why? So you can take
her to your room?

821
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,240
Madhi, you can go

822
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:33,480
Go to your room

823
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:39,040
Why didn't you train me
like you trained her?

824
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,560
Because she's better than you

825
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:47,000
That's all

826
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,240
Aiyo Master

827
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,680
- Madhi
- Master

828
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:43,720
The girl hasn't won a thing

829
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,520
She hit a referee and in national
she lost with shame

830
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,880
And now you bring her
for world championship

831
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,200
Using your influence huh?

832
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,680
I'm sure you haven't heard of
World Cup trials!

833
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:00,600
What else to expect of pea brained
guys gobbling free peas patties?

834
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,000
Come and see in the trails, sir

835
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:08,280
Look around Madhi
Everyone dislikes you

836
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:11,080
They want you to lose
Because you're my student

837
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:14,040
One mistake and
they'll bury you

838
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,680
What do you want?

839
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:19,680
A knockout
You can't win on points

840
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,280
Is that all?

841
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:18,560
"Let not the target leave your sight
Focus with all your might"

842
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:26,840
"Your spark is as tiny as an electron
Just go and ignite it"

843
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:34,200
"Fight fear, fight to the forefront,
unleash the tornado"

844
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:42,240
"And till the last round, harden your heart,
you will catapult to untamed heights"

845
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:46,280
"The magical force
will propel you"

846
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:56,120
"The magical force
will propel you"

847
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:03,320
”Don’t lose hope
You’ll get help to revive”

848
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:11,080
"The magical force will make you
catapult to untamed heights"

849
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,320
"The magical force
will propel you"

850
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,800
Madhi has proven that she's the force
to reckon with by reaching the final

851
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:47,320
Fisherwoman from Chennai is to
fight 3 times world champion Natalia

852
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:58,400
Natalia beat you before
Can you win now?

853
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:02,400
As long as master's with me,
I can beat anyone

854
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:06,840
India is hoping for a miracle from this
young fighter Madhi to come out shining

855
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,200
Enough...go

856
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:49,840
Hey! Why aren't you at the wine shop?
You'll die

857
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:54,320
She called sobbing
Lux lost

858
01:16:57,080 --> 01:17:02,400
The little one's on TV
I'm stealing cable to watch

859
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:08,320
Hurry! I'll call everyone

860
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,360
Come to watch
Madhi’s match on TV today

861
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:14,560
Madhi’s match today
Don’t miss it

862
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:16,240
Bring mother to watch Madhi’s match

863
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:17,680
Next

864
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,880
Madhi
Lightweight India

865
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,520
Your name's not in the list

866
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,280
Next

867
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:27,720
Master

868
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,760
- What's the problem?
- Her name's not in the list

869
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:37,520
- But she's won the semis
- Ask the Association...next

870
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:45,760
Relax
I'll be back

871
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:00,000
Why isn't Madhi on the list?

872
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,280
What is your problem?

873
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,960
Guys, give us 5 minutes please

874
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,800
Thank you

875
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,080
You're back to your shitty tricks

876
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,120
She won in semi final
Why isn't her name there?

877
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:34,600
September 12, 1996, Olympic selection...
you hit me in front of everyone

878
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:39,440
14th August 2001, National Meet,
Chandigarh...

879
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:43,600
...you told the Press
that I didn't know boxing

880
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:47,600
- January 28th...
- Why are you raking up the past?

881
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:54,040
The wound's gone
but the scar remains

882
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,200
She'll fail the dope test

883
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:05,880
Both of you'll be humiliated

884
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,640
The problem is between us

885
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:10,800
Why are you
punishing her?

886
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:13,600
If she fails, you do too

887
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:17,480
Don't do this

888
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,480
This isn't about you,
me or the girl

889
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:22,680
It's about women's boxing

890
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,040
Please Dev

891
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:28,880
Of course it's about you and me
Boxing's my life too

892
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:34,120
I want the fame
But you always intercede

893
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,000
I hate your face

894
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:39,880
Don't waste your time

895
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:40,680
Leave

896
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:48,400
What do I have to do
to get Madhi to fight?

897
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,720
Dev, what should I do?

898
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:58,600
Do resign

899
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:21,680
Let her fight

900
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:29,920
Come in

901
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,360
Give me your ID card

902
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:43,320
Hereon, don't coach, box,
or come to the Federation

903
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:44,880
Come on take it off

904
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:51,720
If I see you in the stadium,
I'll disqualify her

905
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:04,880
Oh my! You've swallowed all that
arrogance to lick my feet?

906
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:14,480
Is she that good in bed?
Please introduce her to me

907
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,880
You don't get it, do you?

908
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:20,080
You're beyond help

909
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:24,840
Make sure she fights

910
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:36,360
Come on

911
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,200
Why are you sitting here?
Follow me

912
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:39,040
Come here

913
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,440
Come dear

914
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,440
Where's master?

915
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,480
Give it

916
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:45,040
- Hello sir
- Hello

917
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:46,000
Where's my master?

918
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:46,920
Just come

919
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,360
Where is my master?

920
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:52,760
He's resigned and bolted

921
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,160
Dev sir's your coach now

922
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:56,760
You go to ready
Hereafter he won't come

923
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,400
Please leave sir

924
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:29,440
I'd sell fish, hog biriyani and
sleep happy

925
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:35,400
You made me dream big
and now you desert me

926
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,440
I'm sure you've a reason

927
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,640
But I'm a dumb bitch
I can't understand

928
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,760
So explain

929
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:49,160
Have I screwed up again?

930
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:53,080
- Tell master
- Madhi!

931
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:58,520
I didn't regret resigning to make you
fight, 'cos boxing's my life

932
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,240
Don't make me regret it

933
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:07,760
Fight for me, you, and
the millions of girls out there

934
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:13,520
Show the world
this Madhi I know

935
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:19,000
Right master
I'll fight

936
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:30,160
You've thrown away
everything for me...

937
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,040
...and if this isn't love,
what is it?

938
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:51,680
A few years ago if someone had said India
would host the World Championship...

939
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:56,280
...and India could even
win, I'd have laughed

940
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,600
But today it's a reality!

941
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:05,320
India's rookie boxer, E.Madhi with
coach Dev Khatri

942
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,640
And here comes
the defending champion

943
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:10,920
Three time World Champion,
Russia's Natalia Raiker

944
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:18,680
In their last encounter, Natalia
knocked out Madhi in eight seconds

945
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:24,760
Russia's brilliant game plan...

946
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:28,960
...Natalia made to lose weight and
fight in a lower category

947
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:54,760
Shake hands

948
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:57,320
First round

949
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:58,520
Box

950
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:23,440
What a powerful hook!

951
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:27,000
She can win
She has everything but the will

952
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:31,120
She has the style and power
but not her favourite coach there

953
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:44,880
Natalia's easily beating Madhi
It's a classic mismatch

954
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:46,960
Will you let her go at any cost?

955
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,160
Please go sir

956
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:53,040
Not every girl's like that
bitch ex-wife of yours

957
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:54,160
Sir-

958
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:59,160
Please convince him
I'm the Chennai coach and you?

959
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:02,000
I am Murali Krishnan

960
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,120
The bitch, his ex-wife's father

961
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:15,200
Madhi is getting hit thoroughly
Natalia in her best form

962
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:17,480
Another fantastic upper cut and hook

963
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,920
Thank God
Madhi's saved by the bell

964
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:21,080
Break for correct time

965
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:25,280
- Go closer! She has a better reach
- Has my master come?

966
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:26,840
He won't

967
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:36,280
Madhi's endured the onslaught so far
but needs to score soon

968
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:37,800
Points has not increased

969
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,680
She's gonna lose!

970
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,920
Jesus, save her

971
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:48,200
Oh Jesus, protect my little girl

972
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:50,720
Seconds out
Second round

973
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:53,800
Madhi should score in this round

974
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:57,280
If Madhi goes on like earlier round,
India is sure to lose

975
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:07,760
Eight

976
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:09,560
Are you okay?

977
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:14,520
Box

978
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:28,840
Saved by the bell again
End of the second round

979
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,680
Madhi's in a lot of pain
Will she continue?

980
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,560
Security
Go to Stand A

981
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,040
- Has my master come?
- Come!

982
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:42,720
Madhi seems to be injured

983
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:46,920
If the doctor declares her unfit,
she forfeits the match

984
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:50,480
The nation waits with bated breath

985
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:52,880
Are you okay?

986
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:00,960
Fantastic right hook!

987
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:10,680
'Genghis Khan knew that the enemy's
strength lay in his weapons'

988
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:15,800
'If you destroy the enemy's weapons,
how will he fight?'

989
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,640
Madhi's hitting her arms

990
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:25,360
Don’t know why Madhi
is attacking her arms

991
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:28,320
I hope she knows
there are no points in that!

992
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:51,080
Ridiculous! Why's she hitting
the arms over and over?

993
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:58,440
Another straight punch from Natalia
She gets more points

994
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,560
Go for the face!

995
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:47,960
Stop...stop

996
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:56,240
Don’t know what Madhi is trying to do

997
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:58,680
Natalia's scored 5 points more

998
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,680
Why are you hitting her arms?
Hit her face!

999
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,960
Go get her!

1000
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:32,120
Go

1001
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:40,000
Seconds out
Fourth round

1002
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:41,440
Box

1003
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,800
The final 50 seconds

1004
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:56,920
Nothing much
Madhi can do now

1005
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:13,520
What is this?

1006
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:15,360
Madhi's lowered her guard

1007
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:18,600
Madhi looks tired
Has she lost confidence?

1008
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:22,840
Has she given up?
Truly disappointing!

1009
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,360
Knockout

1010
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:22,120
The winner by a knockout...

1011
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:28,720
...and the new world champion in the
lightweight category is E.Madhi from India

1012
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:33,600
Sir, our Madhi have won
Come on, sir

1013
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:38,200
What a victory!
What an unprecedented moment!

1014
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:39,760
What a strategy!

1015
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:43,440
She's beaten a three time World Champion,
giving India a gold and the Championship

1016
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:48,400
A slum dweller, a fishmonger from
Chennai's made the impossible possible!

1017
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:52,560
A historic moment!
An unbelievable victory!

1018
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:57,520
Madhi's a testament to
the resilience of Indian women

1019
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:58,400
Not just Madhi

1020
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:01,640
Women's boxing world champion Madhi

1021
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:10,840
Forgive me
You were right

1022
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:15,720
Like I always say,
kill the politics in boxing...

1023
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,680
...and you'll find
a champion every street

1024
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:23,120
My student's done India proud!

1025
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,320
My student!

1026
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,560
She is my...

1027
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:38,800
'After just five years of
Women's boxing in the nation...'

1028
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:42,400
'...India won the Women's World
Boxing Championship in 2006'

1029
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:43,600
'Did you know?'
