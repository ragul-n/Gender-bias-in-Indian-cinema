See how good my son is!

21
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,543
He's showing his respect by
leaning on his knees.

22
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:05,543
He isn't bowing to salute -
he has fallen in eXhaustion.

Oh God! Why do you take poor child
for jogging around every morning.

25
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,088
Don't you see how weak he has become?

26
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,724

There is no need to go with
him for running around.

Yes, ma.

32
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,938

come with us for jogging.

00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,553
For working in the field.
-Go after eating your meals.

00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:49,926
Yes ma. I'll eat something there.

Love has no shape or color. And you
don't love - it just happens!

45
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,208
How your love for Muskan began?

46
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,375
I didn't even realize
when lfell in love.

47
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,408
She looked into my eyes.

48
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,180
I looked in her eyes.

49
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,886
It gave some comfort to heart
and we fell in love

50
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,123
Hey, what happened?
Why are you crying?

Even before looking in my eyes the
girl call me Jbrother‘!

53
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:36,199
And when I try to look into any
girl's eyes she slaps me.

54
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,338
She thinks I'm a puppet - not a man!

55
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:39,733
Why are you laughing, brother?

56
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:45,007
There was a girl - Mrignayani
I still remember her name

57
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:50,109
She used to look at me very intently
it gave me great pleasure.

58
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,017
Neither she slapped me -
nor she called me brother.

59
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:59,062
I went to her home on a rickshaw.
I inquired about her.

60
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,763
It turned out that she was blind!

61
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:06,169
You are laughing, brother!
-No. Not at all.

For 3 ? years I've been trying
to woo Shanti

65
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,208
but Dhiraj her father
doesn't allow me.

66
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,283
You are laughing!

67
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,951
You're worried about your body only.
You show no concern about my love.

68
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,553

00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:51,253
Sorry, I was lying.
Only for this moment.

Yhlrlblnltyllijl.

176
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,961
Because your daughter is coming as a Bahu
(daughter-in-law) of this home.

177
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,363
No doubt I'm lucky.

179
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,929

Look there.

184
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:27,554
Your daughter is walking with her arms
around that man with mustache.

185
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:29,822
Really, Thakur!
-Who is that man?

186
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,459
How do I know. I'm seeing that mustached
man for the first time.

187
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,696
And for the last time.

188
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,456
Hey mustached man ! Who are you?
Which village have you come from?

189
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:39,094
What are you doing with my Bahu?

Pﬁi

191
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:44,331
Papa, I'm the apple of your eyes!
I'm your loving son., Veer!

192
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,166
My son doesn't have mustache!

193
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:47,803
See now, Papa.

194
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,578
Forgive me my son.
I got confused.

195
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,085
Which idiot suggested this to you?

196
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:58,386
Muskan !

197
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,917
Did you ask him to put on mustache?
-Papa, I bought for Lallan.

198
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:08,060
What did I do, papa? I came to say
that wrestling is about to start.

199
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,626
Lallan salutes the residents of
Rajgarh and Junagarh.

200
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:16,029
And from the Colonel uncle
-A military salute.

201
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:21,609
Here comes the popular wrestler of
our Rajgarh - Malhar Singh!

202
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:35,321
It's popularly known that he has
never touched any milk from the pot.

203
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,423
He always drinks milk directly from
the teats of the she buffalo.

204
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:44,333
And here comes Junagarh's
popular wrestler.

205
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:45,729
What is his name?
-Sewak Ram.

206
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,175
Thaku r.
-What?

207
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,243
Their wrestler is very strong.

208
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:03,647
Muscles alone don't count. One should
also be smartness and agility.

209
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,455
Wrestler should also know the
tricks of the trade.

210
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,157
Malhar Singh go and attack him.
Pick him up and throw him here.

211
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,977
He is running !
Where he is going?

212
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,579
Thakur, I can't fight with that man.

213
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,353
What happened?
Have you become nervous?

214
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,748
He is a "I"! 531'- ififfi-filwg ma“

215
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,391
What is he doing?
-Probably he is seeking blessing.

216
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:44,827
You call yourself a wrestler?

218
00:19:54,826 --> 00:20:00,367
Thakur! It seems no one has drunk
his mother's milk in Rajgarh.

219
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,006
Accept your defeat.

220
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,143
All our wrestlers have
proved to be donkeys.

221
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:05,676
Now I'm coming in the ring.

222
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,285
Hey Lallan !
-Yes, papa!

223
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:10,848
Announce my name!

224
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:13,549
What happened to papa?

225
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:15,787
What are you doing, papa?
See how strong he is!

226
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,494
Nothing will happen to me.
I'll throw him out in two seconds.

228
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,200

What's papa's name?
- Punya Pratap Singh.

230
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,807
Wonderful, my son !

231
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,164
Veer, hit him.

00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,029
Hit him, son!

233
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,406
Son ! Don't do that!

234
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,586
You have shown a miracle, son Veer!

235
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,130
You have done great, Veer.
Indeed wonderful.

236
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:45,299
Papa! You're hurt.

He eats good and fights Karate

244
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:19,668
Now my love for you has
increased even more.

00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,340
What are you two doing?

00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:33,643
What's the matter, son?

247
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,282
I'm getting very nervous -

00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,976

C'mon - sleep.

00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,995
Sure, Veer will also come.
Why won't he come?

253
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:56,997
It's his marriage.

Eggs and mil - without sugar.

Why?

He has invited me for lunch
and asked me to bring you too.

Everybody wants to meet him.

What did you say to him?

264
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:28,631
I said I'll certainly bring him.

My happiness? My papa's happiness
lies in my happiness!

It will make me very happy
if you would drink this milk.

272

With whom?

00:25:56,988 --> 00:26:02,336

Papa. You've proved it today!
You don't love me at all.

277
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,845
Don't say such a thing, my son.

278
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:19,219
Ma told me that at the time
of your marriage

279
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,854
my grandpa used to give you
almond milk to drink.

-Yes.

Then what's this, papa.

You want me to drink milk with eggs
and that too without sugar!

I don't know how my son has been
tolerating this? It's very bad!

Look, Veer! Your papa - wearing clowning
dress, and carrying a gun...

295
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:15,136
had come shouting in my house for
begging the hand of my daughter.

I tolerated him.

297
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:24,978
Now I want that you beg my daughter's
hand in presence of all these people.

Go ahead - beg.

If you don't like begging, son -
then make a demand.

No. Bhabhi, can't interfere.

00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:02,607
Let formalities be over first.

344
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,942
Alright. I control myself now for
the coming times.

345
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:11,677
Now stop your naughty talk
I'll show you some lovely things.

346
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:20,153
Aren't they lovely?

347
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:32,265
"This trance and this obsession
Are all because of you sweetheart"

348
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:45,211
"This trance and this obsession
Are all because of you sweetheart"

349
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:52,688
"This passion and vagrancy
Are all because of you sweetheart"

350
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:04,868
"This trance and this obsession
Are all because of you sweetheart"

351
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:12,605
"This passion and vagrancy
Are all because of you sweetheart"

352
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:18,853
"My darling my this heart"

353
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:25,693
"Can't forget you"

354
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:31,957
"My darling my this heart"

355
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:39,468
"Can't forget you"

356
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:49,709
"This trance and this obsession
Are all because of you sweetheart"

357
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:21,534
"You have become my heart's beat"

358
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:35,891
"Though you don't know it my love"

359
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:43,900
"You don't know what you are for me"

360
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:51,777
"This trance and this obsession
Are all because of you sweetheart"

361
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:59,920
"This passion and vagrancy
Are all because of you sweetheart"

362
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:06,094
"My darling my this heart"

363
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:12,628
"Can't forget you"

364
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:19,068
"My darling my this heart"

365
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:26,405
"Can't forget you"

"This trance and this obsession
Are all because of you sweetheart"

367
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:56,901
"My love for you is my passion"

368
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:03,480
"This passion puts me in a trance"

369
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:09,918
"This trance too is my obsession"

370
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:18,098
"My obsession is my vagrancy"

371
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:25,872
"This trance and this obsession
Are all because of you sweetheart"

372
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:33,779
"This passion and vagrancy
Are all because of you sweetheart"

373
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:40,450
"My darling my this heart"

374
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:46,694
"Can't forget you"

375
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:53,127
"My darling my this heart"

376
00:34:53,558 --> 00:35:03,104
"Can't forget you"

377
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,873
Isn't it lovely?
-Yes, very lovely

378
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:08,206
I've named it Doggy.

379
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,282
Doggy! What a beautiful name.

380
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,618


381
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:17,952
If a boy is born - then Baba.
If a girl is born - then Baby.

382
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:22,228
Great. So unique names!
That's what I had expected from you.

What happened to you, Veer ...?

388
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,332
This dog will kill me, papa!

389
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,677
Who? This dog?

390
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:12,814
There was a very big dog, Papa!

391
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,378
There is no big dog here.
It's only this small one.

392
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:20,653
Yesterday you defeated such a
big wrestler and today

393
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,015
you're frightened by a small dog!

394

395
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:29,989
What happened to you, son?

396
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,857
Ma, I saw a very big dog and
It was coming to bite me.

397
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,567
There was no such thing, son.

398
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:42,543
You go to temple. Pray to God.
Everything will be fine.

399
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:55,250
You guys are very lazy.
Are you serving corns or kidding me.

400
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,890
We just now got salt and pepper.

401
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:02,959
I'll dump coal in the oven -
it'll heat, corns will be roasted

402
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:06,428
I'll apply the lemon and salt-
only then will get the corns.

403
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:09,169
Until then play with elephants and
horses. Don't bother me.

404
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:15,772
Where had you gone.
-To the temple.

What?

411
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,530
That your eyes should always
see me like this.

412
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,928
And my body.
-What else?

413
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,238
Your heart should beat only for me.

414
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,106
And my heart should beat for you.

God, protect my son !

423
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,944
Have you forgotten me?
-Yes! And protect him too!

424
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:29,477
What are you two doing?

425
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,988
Honeybees have attached.
Run in different directions.

426
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,415
Don't look back to see whose
good luck or bad luck it is.

427
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:42,597
Hey Veer! I'll run in your direction.

428
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,925
Your good luck will by my good luck.
Your bad luck will be my bad luck.

429
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:47,963
Then let's run !

430
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:53,272
What happened, Muskan?
Left my company so soon !

431
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:54,974
Only for now !

432
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,948
"Ey *"a":¥:.:::?rz: r:::.:°"» veer-

433
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:03,013
ls he running away from honeybees -
or has he run away from Rajgarh.

434
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:07,287
Only for now!

435
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:45,255
What happened, son?
Did honeybees sting you?

436
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:47,527
Don't worry, my son - I'm coming.

437
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:10,786
Papa! Aren't there any photograph taken
between childhood and youth?

438
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,287
What kind of question is this?

439
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:16,054
How such stupid questions
enter your mind?

440
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:20,018
Your son has become mad.
You answer his question.

441
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:25,664
You know son. There is no good
school in our village.

442
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,663
So we sent you to a boarding school.

443
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:32,596
Had I known you'd ask such questions
I'd have put a photographer on duty.

444
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,242
He would have taken a photograph every
week for hanging on wall.

445
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:40,533
Then why don't I remember anything?

446
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,989
How could you remember that, my son?

447
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,330
Once you had come home on vacation.

448
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:58,525
You were playing on the roof.

449
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:02,065
Suddenly you fell down.

450
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,536
You fell over sharp wire net.

451
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:09,010
You were unconscious for many days.

452
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:19,821
We prayed a lot - tried very hard.
Only then you gained consciousness.

453
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:26,017
But when you became conscious -
you had forgotten your past.

454
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:30,998
God gave back our son.

455
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:39,808
Papa. I see many a strange things.

456
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:46,410
Today I saw a man eXactly like me
running before me.

457
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,147
What?

458
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:52,010
Yes, papa! His face was
eXact
y like me.

459
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:53,945
And he was running before me.

460
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:56,853
I've heard this from elderly people

461
00:41:57,448 --> 00:42:03,763
If some one has brush with death he
can remember the things from his past

462
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,328
Don't put pressure on your brain, son

463
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:12,333
Yes. Thakurs should not think too much.
It causes headache to them.

464
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,098
Come here.
Come to me.

465
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,874
If I give you a massage
then you'll become perfectly fine.

466
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:25,385
Will you tell me
howl lost my memory?

467
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:30,488
You're bothered
by such a little thing!

468
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:36,460
It was my 16th spring and
it was first with you.

469
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,323
We went to a cinema house.
To see a movie.

470
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:44,297
We saw the movie and came out.
Singing a hit song of that movie.

471
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:46,801
Holding our hands.
Looking at each other.

472
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:51,736
At that time some scoundrel came
and he pinched me.

473
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:53,071
I shouted.

474
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:58,650
You could not remain quiet.
You started beating him.

475
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:02,047
Then that scoundre
's
friend came with a big stick.

476
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:05,519
<i>Iii-iii?-</i>

477
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:09,262
If you like -you can kiss me.
You pinch me again.

478
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,796
Not once pinch twice. But he didn't
listen. And he hit it on your head.

479
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:18,930
From that day you are
in this condition.

480
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:22,172
I don't believe your story.

481
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:26,671
Why don't you believe?
Am I a liar? Am I lying?

482
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,143
Then you swear by my head.

483
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:30,545
I can't swear for such small matters.

484
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,581
It may be a small matter
for you - but it is a very big thing for me.

485
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:36,517
I see a man resembling me
running before me!

486
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:38,322
ls it a small matter?

487
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:43,028
I think this is the
work of some ghost.

488
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,659
You trust me, and come with me.

489
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,129
There is a Baba (sage)
in the nearby village.

490
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:52,397
He's high reach. We'll ask him.
Everything will return to normal.

491
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,539
We don't need such any Baba
or such fraudulent hypocrites.

492
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:58,975
Brother, she is unnecessarily
instigating you.

493
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:00,772
If you listen to her this Muskan
will make us all weep.

494
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,577
Brother Lallan !
What do people call you?

495
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:13,817
Shorty, dwarf and many such things.

496
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:16,357
Do you like all that?

497
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:19,189
No, I don't like that.

498
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:24,069
So brother Lallan.
Who needs this Baba most.

499
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:26,305
VVhs?

500
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:30,840
If you go to Baba - you'll gain some
height. Then who will you get?

501
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:32,908
I'll get Shanti!

502
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,075
Come.

503
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:39,354
Baba - I'm in too much pain.

504
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,583
Body has been greatly hurt.

505
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:45,791
Shanti (patience) - my child.

506
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:49,154
Patience can treat every pain.

507
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:54,335
Shanti's parents have refused.
That has disturbed my life.

508
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:59,301
I'm not referring to that Shanti.
By shanti I mean patience.

509
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:09,048
I'm a you since 3 ? years but my height
hasn't increased beyond 4 ?

510
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:11,613
That I can see. But the reason?

511
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:17,119
My height increased up to 13 years.
Thereafter only my age.

512
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:23,491
The solution of your problem
is somewhere around here.

513
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,958
I got it.

514
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:29,461
It's somewhat difficult -
will you be able to do it?

515
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,867
I'll do Baba.

516
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,768
Free the fingers from the rings.

517
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,305
I'll do it right now.

518
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,343
What are you doing?

519
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:42,674
Not my rings. Your rings.
Go and sit there.

520
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:44,281
How should I go.

521
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:49,317
God gives the height carefully.
Height and brain - both are short.

522
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,987
Baba, he is Veer.

523
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,526
If he is Veer -
I'm Faqir (the ascetic).

524
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,366
A line drawn on stone.
Tell me your problem.

525
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,298
He sees 'sapna' (dream)
even when he is awake.

526
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:09,603
So what. Sapna is so beautiful.
What is wrong in seeing her?

527
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,840
She isn't that sapna (dream).
Her name is Muskan.

528
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:20,476
What is the problem?

529
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:23,583
Baba, he sees strange things.

530
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:26,985
Not only that, yesterday he saw a
man resembling him.

Story of two identical twins.

533
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:39,271

Do you remember.
Our mother cries even today.

00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:08,029
She goes to temple and cries.
Fights with the goddess and says

538
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:18,346
Ma! You're a mother.
Give back my Karan and Arjun.

539
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:24,042
She weeps very much. Even today she
goes by bullock cart to mustard field

540
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:31,623
Yellow flowers. How could you forget?
as mad woman she goes in bullock cart

542
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:41,669
It's the meeting place of births.

543
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:11,667
Baba, he is Thakur's only son.
He doesn't have any brother.

544
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:15,426
I'm not talking about this birth.
I'm talking about previous birth.

545
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:18,229
I told you to keep quiet.
I'll hit you with the skull.

546
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:26,645
I've understood the problem.
Put a 1000 bucks here.

547
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:31,152
I'll have to work very hard
to find a solution (hull).

548
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:35,011
I've to go very far.
It generally costs 4000.

549
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:39,020
But for you I'll do it in 3000.

550
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:44,488
Don't worry about the hull plough).
I can get 50 from my village.

551
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,094
This is my Guru's skull.
-My greetings to him too.

552
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,430
Get Shiva's leaves with this.

553
00:48:58,302 --> 00:48:59,212
Greetings, papa.

554
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:01,073
Where are you coming from?
-Have a long life, son.

555
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:05,842
I've very good news.
It'll make you very happy.

556
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,214
All doubts have been cleared.

557
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:12,857
Now our Veer will have
no problem in this birth.

558
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:15,127
There is a little problem from
the last birth.

559
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:16,864
And a little problem of memory.

560
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,623
Baba is looking for a solution
of these problems.

561
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,870
Baba? Which Baba?

562
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:25,331
Don't you know that Baba?

563
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,836
Look Colonel - papa doesn't
know about Baba!

564
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:32,705
Baba's magic is better than
anything else in the world.

565
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:37,176
Now you don't have to go to
doctors of any school.

566
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:40,921
Baba has also the treatment for
the problems of anger.

00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:57,029


571
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,168
I didn't take him, papa.

572

<i>Did he take you to any Baha'i?</i>

573
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:06,909
Papa, it wasn't our mistake.

574
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:10,479
We were taken to Baba by

575
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:11,947
Lallan took me to Baba.

576
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:13,716

Have you gone mad?
Why did you take Veer to Baba?

579
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:31,703
What could I do, papa. I just followed
wherever Veer was going.

580
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:34,805
And listen, Lallan.

581
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:38,145
Nothing has happened to my son.
He is healthy and hearty.

582
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,776
There is no need to take him to
anyone for treatment.

583
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,749
Now do one thin.
Take Muskan to her home.

584
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,748
Yes, papa.
-Go, dear.

585
00:50:57,954 --> 00:50:59,228
What is the matter, my son?

586
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:03,303
Don't you trust your father that
you go to such hypocrites?

587
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,800
I say you're are perfectly well and
there is no need to go to anybody.

588
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,009

00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,304

00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,913


591
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:19,949
Papa is very upset.
You don't worry, son.

592
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:25,655
Uncle. How did you get
this wound scar?

593
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:31,155
When I was on border an enemy's bullet
hit me. It is a scar of that.

594
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:32,264
Really?

595
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:38,663
Papa, if this the mark of the bullet,
then what are all these marks?

596
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,364
You too believe your uncle's tales.

597
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:46,700
He surely was in the army. But
ask him what he used to do there!

598
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:48,402
Why don't you tell my son !

599
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:53,775
I was surely in the army, son.
But I used to work in the kitchen.

600
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:55,875
In fact a wire pieced me here.

601
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:58,885
It doesn't look good to say
that a wire had pierced here.

602
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,986
Say that a bullet had pierced
gives me some pride.

603
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:04,153
Was it barbed wire.
-Yes son.

604
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:08,860
How long will you stand naked -
go and wear your clothes.

605
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,325
Yes, papa.
I'll wear the shirt.

606
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:18,030
It has been our constant effort
that other backward villages too

607
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:22,138
should march with us and prosper.

608
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:33,020
I'm glad to tell you that we're
succeeded in all our missions.

609
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:35,856

He is your Chief Minister.
But I'm your Home Minister.

613
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:56,304
He will give you tears.
I will give you Muskan (smiles).

614
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:59,944
He'll go away after 7 minutes.

615
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:03,180
I won't leave you even after 7 lives.

616
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:06,349
There is vast difference between
his words and deeds.

617
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,250
There is difference between
my words and deeds.

618
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:15,063
He will destroy your home.
We will make our home there.

619
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,996
Understand, Mr. Veer.

620
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:19,295
He is cunning

621
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:09,183
Chief Minister!

622
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:12,378
That man will shoot you !

623
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,918
He will shoot you from there.

624
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:23,324
Chief Minister, he will shoot you.

625
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:24,587
From where?
-From there.

626
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:26,461
Nothing is there, son !

627
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,528
What is there?
There is nothing at all!

628
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,475
Who is this man?
What's this nonsense?

629
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:37,674
Minister - he is my son.

630
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:41,982
He has been sick and sees strange
things. Please forgive him, sir.

631
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:45,182
Okay, you take care of him.

What is this?

Then or how? Nothing has happened.
You are perfectly alright.

635
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:02,893
Do you know howl lost my memory?

636

Tell me if you know.
I swear you on my life.

Don't swear me, brother.

forest to search Shanti.

00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:24,650
I thought probably you are
talking about my Shanti

642
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:27,155
Without thinking twice
I accompanied you.

643
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:30,961
We didn't find Shanti but we came
face to face with a bear.

644
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,595
We two were alone with the bear.

645
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:40,406
When bearjumped on us I was shocked
and climbed the tree.

646
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:43,209
I left you for that moment.

647
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,342
You are a brave man -
you stayed to fight with it.

648
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:49,342
You are lying to me.

649
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,242
How how am I lying.
You listen to the rest of it.

650
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:54,555
You fought bravely for a long time.

651
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:59,393
There was struggle. During that
struggle bear struck its paw.

652
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,863
But listen, brother. It
did strike you with the paw.

653
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:04,893
That's why you're in this condition.

No Geeta. Time has come to
tell him the truth.

You are not my son.

That I am not your son.

742
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:13,191
Hear ma! What is papa saying!
That I am not your son!

743
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:15,891
You are lying, papa-

744
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:19,023
Papa - you're lying.

745
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:28,731
If that was the truth then
why didn't you tell me?

746
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:31,335
I don't want to know such truth.

747
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:44,657
If I'm not your son -

748
01:09:46,982 --> 01:09:48,393
then who am I?

749
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:51,461
And ma - who is Veer?

750
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,060
I'm telling you, son.

751
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:56,029
Veer was our son.

And here is another surprise.

01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:14,047
What is this?
- Ma, this is 3-in-1.

757
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:16,722
Now throw away your old radio
and keep this one.

758
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:21,088
Son, new things look good
but it is very hard to use them.

759
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:24,364
Absolutely not, papa.
It's very easy. Look

760
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:29,794
This tape recorder -
this is CD and this is radio.

761
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,105
This is All India Radio.
An important announcement.

762
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:33,668
War has started in Kargil.

763
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:38,434
All soldiers on vacation must
report to their regiments.

764
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:04,261
If you were to go so soon
they why did you come?

765
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:08,803
Ma. After winning the Kargil war
I will come back again.

766
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:12,210

Bless me so I shall return
after succeeding.

770
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:30,062
When you will come back, I shall arrange
a feast for all villagers

771
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:31,729
I shall have big celebration.

Kill 2-4 enemies on my behalf too.

775
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:55,907
You were asking, son
why you can't remember anything!

776
01:12:57,172 --> 01:12:58,913
You had been hit by 5 bullets.

777
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:02,745
You were unconscious for 8 months.

778
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:08,553
Day and night - your mother
never left you alone.

779
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:16,195
And when you gained consciousness
you had lost your memory.

780
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:22,808
But when you became conscious
you held my hand and said

781
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:25,340
Ma!

782
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:29,807

We feared that knowing the truth
you will leave us and go away.

Forgive us for that, son.

787

Consider us your own and forgive us
-Don't say such things, papa.

Papa, I am unhappy about why you
couldn't be my real parents.

790

The amount of love that
you have bestowed upon me -

791
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,691
probably parents would not give that
much love to their real born son.

792
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:20,726
Don't weep my son.
You are our son.

We may have told you the secret

Had you met with a fraudulent Baba?

849
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:59,535
Are you going to Bombay
in search of your brother?

850
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:03,006
Don't follow such frauds.

851
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:06,433
Take God's name and go back, son.

852
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:08,277
Go back. Everything will be fine.

853
01:20:42,404 --> 01:20:43,405
Brother!

854
01:20:44,272 --> 01:20:46,809
Hey Mister.
Do you want to die.

855
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:49,010
Can't you see?

856
01:21:07,829 --> 01:21:10,605
Boss.

857
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:13,342
You idiot you made me
forget the counting.

858
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:15,180
Did you get a big catch or small?

859
01:21:15,437 --> 01:21:17,576
It was big but that man is
coming after me.

860
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,511
Don't worry Let him come.

861
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:22,286
He is here, boss.

862
01:21:27,983 --> 01:21:30,293
Whose purse have you stolen ?

863
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:35,099
Don't you know?
Give it back to him.

864
01:21:38,093 --> 01:21:39,299
Excuse me brother.
He made a mistake.

865
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:40,639
He is new in this business.

866
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:44,010
He doesn't know me,
but you know me.

867
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:45,572
Who doesn't know you?

868
01:21:45,934 --> 01:21:48,107
Tell me. Who am I?
-Are you upset, brother?

869
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:51,313
Tell me - who am I?
-What do you say, brother?

870
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:02,084
You tell me.
Do you know me?

871
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:04,157
If I had known I would
not have picked your pocket.

872
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:06,965
I know that my boss fears
only two kind of people.

873
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:10,962
Police and Mafia's men.
You must be one of them.

874
01:22:55,203 --> 01:22:57,911
"What happened to you?"

875
01:22:58,206 --> 01:23:02,154
"My heart is getting restless."

876
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:05,083
"Why is it so?"

877
01:23:05,413 --> 01:23:09,384
"I don't even know?"

878
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:14,327
"What's that has happened?"

879
01:23:14,589 --> 01:23:19,163
"I don't know what happened."

880
01:23:19,461 --> 01:23:21,839
"Heartbeats increased"

881
01:23:22,197 --> 01:23:26,270
"Like heartbeats had stopped."

882
01:23:26,534 --> 01:23:29,037
"How is breathing"

883
01:23:29,437 --> 01:23:33,351
"Even breathing is out of control."

884
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:38,214
"Oh ho what happened to you?"

885
01:23:38,546 --> 01:23:43,083
"Has that happened to you?"

886
01:23:43,084 --> 01:23:46,657
"What happened to you?"

887
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:24,734
"it is so hard to hide"

888
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:29,509
"Telling is even harder than that."

889
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:38,841
"But don't hide the secrets of heart
From someone who is your own."

890
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:48,691
"I do want to say but
It is hard to say anything"

891
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:58,001
"Illness you've contracted
Only God can save you."

892
01:24:58,326 --> 01:25:00,567
"Any remedy"

893
01:25:00,895 --> 01:25:04,775
"There is no remedy for it."

894
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:07,240
"What will happen now?"

895
01:25:07,802 --> 01:25:11,875
"I don't know it at all"

896
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:16,849
"Oh ho - what has happened?"

897
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:21,959
"I don't know what has happened."

898
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:24,958
"What happened to you?"

899
01:25:56,618 --> 01:26:05,561
"if you don't tell me
Secrets of heart, my love"

900
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:15,210
"You'll see, my love
You'll suffer all life"

901
01:26:15,803 --> 01:26:24,553
"What is this turn
What is this trance"

902
01:26:25,113 --> 01:26:33,624
"Where I am
I've no idea."

903
01:26:33,988 --> 01:26:40,803
"Try to understand
What is in your heart."

904
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:48,011
"My heart now
Isn't with me."

905
01:26:48,369 --> 01:26:53,546
"It's yours
What can I do."

906
01:26:53,808 --> 01:26:57,881
"Oh ho - I'm in love."

907
01:27:33,514 --> 01:27:35,050
Did you find anything there?

908
01:27:35,883 --> 01:27:39,262
My boss fears two kind of people -
Police and Mafia's men.

909
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:40,827
And you are one of them.

910
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:51,008
God. Protect my son.

911
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:40,252


912
01:29:41,075 --> 01:29:44,420
Now tell me who am I?

913
01:29:45,913 --> 01:29:50,589
“Awn”.

Look. If you know me.
You would know my brother too.

Tell me where is my brother?
What kind of trouble he is in?

There is no use now. There is nothing
like what it used to be.

924
01:31:02,557 --> 01:31:05,800
Go back from here.
Please go away from here.

925
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:14,241
Yes. You had a brother.

926

<i>Make a way.
Move away from here.</i>

927
01:32:37,285 --> 01:32:38,559
Brother, where is this place?

928
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:39,923
This place

Where is this place?
Please tell me where is this place?

930
01:32:44,258 --> 01:32:47,330
This place is in Noor Mohalla.

Where is that?
-Byc:ula?

932

Inhk-IMI.

01:34:04,005 --> 01:34:05,177
I don't remember anything.

935
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:07,879
Just tell me, boy. Who I am?

936
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:10,753
Take me to my house, Tyson.

937
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:20,632
Sir, he has come back.

943
01:36:10,164 --> 01:36:11,472
Congratulations, Mr. Ali.

944

I didn't miss my target.

01:37:11,225 --> 01:37:16,834

That you love me!

ls this a speak-able thing?.

956
01:37:38,819 --> 01:37:40,890
But when you say it
it feels very good.

957
01:37:51,065 --> 01:37:53,102
I love you very much.

958
01:37:54,668 --> 01:37:56,113

they a good couple, lnder?

01:38:24,698 --> 01:38:26,234
Rahim uncle looks very happy.

962
01:38:27,034 --> 01:38:28,877
Come. I was waiting for you.

963
01:38:29,904 --> 01:38:30,882
Greetings, uncle.

964
01:38:31,272 --> 01:38:33,616
Greetings, uncle.
-Thank you.

965
01:38:33,941 --> 01:38:35,284
Congratulations, uncle.

966
01:38:36,443 --> 01:38:38,889
Thank you but where have
you been so long?

967
01:38:39,246 --> 01:38:41,055
Uncle, it was our shooting
competition today....

968
01:38:41,348 --> 01:38:44,921
Right. I know the rest. Ali must
be first and you would be second.

969
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:47,865
This isn't anything new, uncle.
This happens every year.

970
01:38:48,255 --> 01:38:51,236
It has happened every year.
But I will be first next year.

971
01:38:54,428 --> 01:38:57,238
Why are you giving
last year's bill?

972
01:38:57,631 --> 01:39:01,602
I haven't taken any food or water
so far. Have fear of God.

973
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:06,282
Hey Dilbar Khan.
New rules for the new place.

974
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:09,587
I've stopped giving credit.
Pay all old bills.

975
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:14,051
For God's sake why are you
being so impolite, buddy.

976
01:39:14,548 --> 01:39:18,189
The first day of your hotel business
is it the last day of our friendship?

977
01:39:18,552 --> 01:39:20,657
Have I ever taken any money from you?

978
01:39:20,921 --> 01:39:26,166
I put a cable connection in your old
hotel - did I ask for any money?

979
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:32,138
It's the inauguration of your new hotel and
I put the cable connection.

980
01:39:32,433 --> 01:39:33,468
Did I ask for any money?

981

jlll-ﬂ-I
ﬂlndlb-W I.‘

982
01:39:37,705 --> 01:39:42,415
I'll pay for your cable at Rs.100 - you
pay my bill for the food you eat.

983
01:39:43,010 --> 01:39:49,256
Oh buddy uncle you offend easily.
You can't even take a small joke.

984
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:52,563
God may keep you happy,
but answer my question, friend.

985
01:39:53,387 --> 01:39:55,560
Why are you so worried.

986
01:39:55,889 --> 01:40:02,033
You don't have a wife. You don't have
a child. What will you do with money?

987
01:40:02,396 --> 01:40:08,870
How do you say I don't have family?
I've Ali, Mahak, Azan and lnder.

988
01:40:10,237 --> 01:40:12,649
God may prosper your family.

989
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:16,351
And give some sense to Ali so that they
both may get married soon.

990
01:40:16,677 --> 01:40:20,022
And he may little babies then my
family will become even bigger.

991
01:40:20,447 --> 01:40:22,757
Ali and sense. It's very hard.

992
01:40:23,083 --> 01:40:27,998
If Ali had any sense - he would have
sent his brother to some good school.

993
01:40:28,822 --> 01:40:31,826
Why do you want to make him a poor
man by giving him education.

994
01:40:32,126 --> 01:40:34,037
Send him to your maternal uncle.

995
01:40:34,395 --> 01:40:37,001
He'll train him in the
business of cable TV.

996
01:40:37,297 --> 01:40:38,833
When he grows up he will
become a big man.

997
01:40:39,133 --> 01:40:41,875
Uncle Rahim - it is your phone.
-Ask him to call me later.

998
01:40:42,202 --> 01:40:43,738
Someone is talking very rudely.

999
01:40:45,272 --> 01:40:46,182
I'll see him.

1000
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:50,989
Must be some rude childhood friend.
I don't have any enemy.

1001
01:40:57,918 --> 01:40:58,953
Who is speaking.

1002
01:41:11,198 --> 01:41:16,011
You must have read in paper
and heard it on TV too about the...

1003
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:18,646
problems concerning the underworld.

1004
01:41:19,373 --> 01:41:23,321
There is no way to deal with the
underworld goons and shooters .

1005
01:41:23,744 --> 01:41:26,554
Only solution is to kill them.

1006
01:41:27,281 --> 01:41:30,228
As long as they are alive they will
spread this evil in the society.

1007
01:41:30,684 --> 01:41:36,225
If policemen do this, the social
welfare and human rights people...

1008
01:41:36,557 --> 01:41:39,504
make a hue and cry.
It is called police atrocity.

1009
01:41:39,893 --> 01:41:44,899
No witness comes fonlvard
As a result they have to be freed.

1010
01:41:45,466 --> 01:41:48,345
And everybody says that
police are corrupt and dishonest.

1011
01:41:48,702 --> 01:41:50,340
But sir, why are you telling
all this to us.

1012
01:41:50,671 --> 01:41:53,015
What can we do for you?

1013
01:41:54,942 --> 01:42:00,551
Law that has tied our hands has given
them freedom to do whatever they like

1014
01:42:01,081 --> 01:42:05,791
So, the Home Minister and
I have made a secret plan.

1015
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:09,329
We will enroll some
very good marksmen.

1016
01:42:09,723 --> 01:42:12,567
They'll kill the underworld goons
on behalf of the police.

1017
01:42:14,061 --> 01:42:17,804
We'll say that they were killed due to
infighting of the underworld.

They'll say we loved so much that we
couldn't even wait to get married.

1079
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:34,612
Great. Mr. Ali, after marriage
I'll have to live with you.

1080

Then do come.

1081

01:48:55,128 --> 01:48:58,632
He wanted that I and lnder
should kill some underworld dons.

1085
01:48:59,332 --> 01:49:01,938
Have both of you gone mad?
ls this the work to do?

01:49:02,269 --> 01:49:03,942
We have refused.

I'm asking about marriage, honey?

1095
01:49:41,341 --> 01:49:43,218
See. We shouldn't take
any decision on empty stomach.

I'm taking you for dinner! Come!

1097
01:49:45,478 --> 01:49:47,480
Uncle, tell me one thing.

1098
01:49:47,814 --> 01:49:49,725
I want to make lot of money like you.

1099
01:49:50,150 --> 01:49:52,528
Why do you always run after money?

1100
01:49:52,852 --> 01:49:56,265

He is the first man of 21 century
who doesn't care about the money.

Uncle, who is this man.

1108
01:50:18,912 --> 01:50:20,619
These are bad times, son.

1109
01:50:21,615 --> 01:50:25,028
You've seen me since childhood
when I had a small shop.

1110
01:50:25,585 --> 01:50:29,658
Through hard work I've reached this level
and opened this hotel - but...

1111
01:50:30,090 --> 01:50:31,831
I got a phone call.
-Phone?

1112
01:50:32,092 --> 01:50:34,333
Give halfa million
or you'll be killed.

1113
01:50:34,628 --> 01:50:35,698
Halfa million.

1114
01:50:36,029 --> 01:50:40,944
Any way. I told the Commissioner and
he has provided this security.

1115
01:50:41,301 --> 01:50:43,110
But uncle, there is a
great danger in this.

1116
01:50:43,336 --> 01:50:47,751
Uncle, I'm shivering by hearing it.
Be careful, uncle.

1117
01:50:48,041 --> 01:50:50,180
Yes. That's why I got this security.

1118
01:50:50,677 --> 01:50:54,284
Uncle, money is not bigger than life.
why don't you give them money.

1119
01:50:55,415 --> 01:51:00,057
I don't have, but even if I had
I would not have given.

1120
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:02,625
Bowing before terror is a crime.

1121
01:51:02,989 --> 01:51:05,492
I'll give away money in charity -
I won't give it to those people.

1122
01:51:05,792 --> 01:51:07,271
Uncle that's correct - but

1123
01:51:07,494 --> 01:51:09,303
What have I taught you
since childhood?

1124
01:51:10,163 --> 01:51:15,010
Respect, obscurity, fame, and death -
all that is in God's hand.

1125
01:51:15,568 --> 01:51:17,570
Whatever happens will be for good.

1126
01:51:17,837 --> 01:51:19,282

Has Munna got the admission?

1131
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:35,097
Yes. He got admission
in the boarding school.

1132
01:51:35,522 --> 01:51:38,560
Just complete his form -
I've paid the fees.

1133
01:51:41,261 --> 01:51:44,640

1134
01:51:45,098 --> 01:51:52,243
We eat food. We live in your home.
-My son. I'm a businessman.

1135
01:51:52,572 --> 01:51:55,644
I don't do any unprofitable deal.
This too will be beneficial to me.

1136
01:51:56,042 --> 01:51:57,953
What benefit could you get from this?

1137
01:51:58,978 --> 01:52:01,720
You don't have parents.
I don't have any children.

1138
01:52:03,783 --> 01:52:05,785
So it is to my advantage.

1139
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:09,964

Rahim uncle is our father.

We were eating his food.
We were living on his kindness.

Brother! Don't do anything!
Keep your medals in your homes.

Do target shooting and
build your bodies

1157
01:53:49,756 --> 01:53:52,202
You can't do anything.
Wear the bangles.

Help me, God.

1161
01:55:00,827 --> 01:55:02,568

1164
01:55:36,529 --> 01:55:37,837
Shoot.

1165
01:55:56,516 --> 01:55:58,325
Why did you kill those three goons?

1166
01:55:58,518 --> 01:56:02,227
Sir, you don't know how cruelly
they killed Rahim uncle.

1167

And they killed that policemen too.

1168
01:56:05,291 --> 01:56:06,599
What was his crime, sir?

1169
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:10,669
Just because he refused to give
his hard earned money to them?

1170
01:56:12,165 --> 01:56:13,371
We couldn't tolerate it.

1171
01:56:13,666 --> 01:56:15,805
Really? Do you know
who were those people?

1172
01:56:16,169 --> 01:56:19,241
They had killed at least
ten innocent people.

1173
01:56:19,605 --> 01:56:23,382
One Rahim uncle's death
has disturbed you so much.

01:57:30,543 --> 01:57:35,322
Don't talk like that. Distance always
makes the heart grow fonder.

1187
01:57:36,449 --> 01:57:37,689
Take care of yourself.

1188
01:58:07,814 --> 01:58:11,591
<i>Pww"!.</i>

1189
01:58:15,855 --> 01:58:24,605
I'm afraid too, Mahak.
But I've taken this decision.

1190
01:58:24,831 --> 01:58:27,937
God will forgive us.
Whatever we are doing is correct.

1191
01:59:26,859 --> 01:59:31,859
These 25,000 are for those three and take
another 25,000 as gift from me.

1192
02:00:11,103 --> 02:00:16,314
Why clanks your bangle
Why shines your dot

1193
02:00:20,813 --> 02:00:25,558
Why clanks your bangle
Why shines your dot

1194
02:00:25,851 --> 02:00:30,493
Why clangs your anklet
Why jingles your earrings

1195
02:00:30,790 --> 02:00:32,565
My bangle

1196
02:00:32,925 --> 02:00:34,802
My dot

1197
02:00:35,261 --> 02:00:39,869
My bangle, my dot
My anklet and my bracelet

1198
02:00:40,166 --> 02:00:45,013
Have lost their sense ever since
You've met me my beloved.

1199
02:00:49,508 --> 02:00:54,958
Why clanks your bangle
Why shines your dot

1200
02:01:13,099 --> 02:01:22,781
This usually happens in youth
Bracelet clinks and bangle clanks

1201
02:01:23,042 --> 02:01:27,320

My dot

1206

My bangle, my dot
My anklet and my bracelet

1207
02:01:48,701 --> 02:01:53,548
Have lost their sense ever since
You've met me my beloved.

1208
02:01:58,077 --> 02:02:03,322
Why clanks your bangle
Why shines your dot

1209
02:02:29,508 --> 02:02:34,508
How will you live without me
Whom will you call your lover

1210
02:02:39,952 --> 02:02:49,134
Who knows what will happen tomorrow
Think how you'll live alone.

1211
02:02:55,668 --> 02:03:00,708
I'll die

1212
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:04,487
I'll do such a thing

1213
02:03:05,177 --> 02:03:09,990


1214
02:03:10,316 --> 02:03:15,316
If you desert me.

1215
02:03:20,159 --> 02:03:24,505
Everything I've
It'll go with you

1216
02:03:24,830 --> 02:03:29,301
Yes everything I've is for you
You know it my love my life

1217
02:03:29,668 --> 02:03:34,617
I'll sacrifice my life for you

1218
02:03:39,111 --> 02:03:43,821
Why clanks your bangle
Why shines your dot

1219
02:03:44,083 --> 02:03:48,862
Why clangs your anklet
Why jingles your earrings

1220
02:03:49,121 --> 02:03:53,900
Why clanks your bangle
Why shines your dot

1221
02:04:13,779 --> 02:04:16,919
Congratulations.

1222
02:04:17,383 --> 02:04:20,387
Tell me Ali. You are very clever.

1223
02:04:20,786 --> 02:04:26,361
Tell me. What is this?
-I don't know.

1224
02:04:26,759 --> 02:04:35,270
This is a camera that showed the scandals
in army and cricket on TV

1225
02:04:35,534 --> 02:04:37,536
It created sensation
throughout India.

1226
02:04:37,770 --> 02:04:39,306
But what will you do with this.

1227
02:04:39,672 --> 02:04:42,653
lnder, you are a child.
Ali will understand it.

1228
02:04:42,975 --> 02:04:48,049
Ali tell me how many people cheat
their wives in our neighborhood.

1229
02:04:48,414 --> 02:04:51,361
We'll sell this camera to
such deceived women.

1230
02:04:51,450 --> 02:04:54,260
They will put it in the pockets
of their husband to take pictures.

1232
02:04:57,556 --> 02:04:59,729
Uncle, why are you trapping us
in this scandal.

1233
02:05:00,059 --> 02:05:03,700
Oh buddy - trust Dilbar Khan -
it's very profitable.

1234
02:05:04,396 --> 02:05:05,670
Uncle, can I keep it.

1235
02:05:06,966 --> 02:05:09,674
Have you any doubt about Ali.

1236
02:05:10,503 --> 02:05:12,813
No uncle, I trust Ali very much.

1237
02:05:13,239 --> 02:05:15,116
I wanted to see how he it works.

1240
02:05:29,655 --> 02:05:32,431
Mahak don't you trust me?

1241
02:05:32,958 --> 02:05:35,165
I trust you more than my life.

1242
02:05:35,561 --> 02:05:36,835
Then what will you use it for?

1243
02:05:37,296 --> 02:05:39,742
I won't use it.
You two will use it.

1244
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:45,506
Whatever conversation you have
with the Commissioner. Record it.

1245
02:05:46,071 --> 02:05:49,280
What if there is any problem
tomorrow for any reason?

1246
02:05:49,575 --> 02:05:52,784
How can you prove that you did
everything at Commissioner's command.

1247
02:05:53,379 --> 02:05:55,359
That's the purpose of this record.

1248
02:05:56,715 --> 02:05:59,457
Commissioner is a very good man.
He is very trustworthy.

1249
02:05:59,718 --> 02:06:05,669
No Ali. Mahak is right. You can't
trust anybody these days.

1250
02:06:12,164 --> 02:06:16,840
For the man you'll be shooting
this time you both will get 500,000 each.

1251
02:06:17,269 --> 02:06:19,579
500,000?
-Yes.

1252
02:06:19,838 --> 02:06:20,908
Who is that man, sir?

1253
02:06:21,407 --> 02:06:23,978
<i>iii.
H1!</i>

1254
02:06:26,045 --> 02:06:28,753
Sir, why do you want to get
us killed. What is our mistake.

1255
02:06:29,248 --> 02:06:31,728
What will we do of these 500,000?
Will we take it to the grave?

1256
02:06:32,017 --> 02:06:33,121
Because later on you're
going to send us to gallows.

1257
02:06:33,419 --> 02:06:35,956
Not gallows.
It can make your life.

1258
02:06:36,488 --> 02:06:38,559
But sir, why do you want to have
the Chief Minister killed?

1259
02:06:38,891 --> 02:06:41,497
I don't want to get him killed.
He wants to die!

1260
02:06:41,994 --> 02:06:43,632
But there are other ways to die.

1261
02:06:43,929 --> 02:06:48,344
Poison. Hang himself. Jump from
some building or lay down on railway track

1262
02:06:48,701 --> 02:06:50,237
By dying why is he putting our
life at stake.

1263
02:06:50,736 --> 02:06:53,342
Only he can tell that.
Both of you come with me.

1264
02:06:55,040 --> 02:06:56,610
-'Il_w§I'.

1265
02:06:57,977 --> 02:07:00,958
He is our Chief Minister.
-Namaste.

1266
02:07:01,213 --> 02:07:03,523
And he is our Home Minister
Mr. Sadanand Pandey.

1267
02:07:04,283 --> 02:07:08,322
Sir, as I had mention to you
he is Mr. Ali and he is Mr. lnder.

1268
02:07:10,522 --> 02:07:12,968
Okay.

1269
02:07:15,327 --> 02:07:19,742
We have called you here for a
very confidential job.

1270
02:07:20,532 --> 02:07:23,012
It should not be leaked out.

1271
02:07:23,369 --> 02:07:25,371
Thank you very much Sir,
for showing trust in us.

1272
02:07:25,838 --> 02:07:28,842
Sir, you tell us
it won't be leaked out.

1273
02:07:30,376 --> 02:07:37,817
Our intelligence report shows
that our party's position is uncertain.

1274
02:07:38,183 --> 02:07:39,753
Anything can happen.

1275
02:07:40,119 --> 02:07:42,258
We might win or we might be defeated.

1276
02:07:42,655 --> 02:07:48,162
If our party is defeated, the
opposition will form the Government.

1277
02:07:48,527 --> 02:07:51,872
If they come in power then you
know what will happen.

1278
02:07:52,231 --> 02:07:53,972
And then what will happen
to this State?

1279
02:07:54,299 --> 02:08:02,275
You know that despite my faults
I've done a lot for this State.

1280
02:08:02,608 --> 02:08:07,284
So that I can continue my work
it's necessary to remain in power.

1281
02:08:08,347 --> 02:08:12,295
Excuse sir, but how could
we help in this.

1282
02:08:13,419 --> 02:08:16,366
You will shoot me,
but I will not die.

1283
02:08:18,223 --> 02:08:20,328
Sir!
-Yes.

1284
02:08:20,659 --> 02:08:22,798
I'd be wearing a bullet proofjacket.

1285
02:08:23,362 --> 02:08:31,645
News on all TV channels will say that
a murder attempt was made on C.M.

1286
02:08:32,004 --> 02:08:37,386
I'll get the public sympathy and our
party will win with a majority vote.

1287
02:08:38,010 --> 02:08:40,752
But sir, this is very dangerous.
You could even loose your life.

1288
02:08:41,246 --> 02:08:42,691
What are you saying?

1289
02:08:42,915 --> 02:08:45,020
Commissioner says that
you never miss your target.

1290
02:08:45,718 --> 02:08:49,666
Sir, it is different to kill
the criminals. But you're very good man.

1291
02:08:50,122 --> 02:08:53,695
What if by mistake
Sir, I can't do this job.

1292
02:08:54,393 --> 02:08:58,068
Look. By doing this you'll
indirectly help the people.

1293
02:08:58,397 --> 02:09:01,071
And you'll also get one million.

1294
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:02,640
One million!

1295
02:09:04,703 --> 02:09:06,649
Sir, we are ready for this job.

1296
02:09:08,273 --> 02:09:11,550
No, Sir. It's very dangerous.
Sir, we are ready for this job.

1297
02:09:11,944 --> 02:09:15,221
What are you saying.
-Have your missed any target before.

1298
02:09:15,848 --> 02:09:17,725
And we will get this money for
not killing someone.

1299
02:09:18,050 --> 02:09:19,256
On million!

1300
02:09:22,054 --> 02:09:23,692
Sir, we are ready for this job.

Commissioner will eXplain the
other things to you.

02:09:34,533 --> 02:09:40,484
Commissioner. Take them with you
and eXplain the complete plan.

1304
02:09:47,479 --> 02:09:49,652
You will shoot me,
but I will not die.

Will you kill the Chief Minister.

Who is killing the Chief Minister?
Have you gone mad. Want us killed.

Mahak, sit.

02:10:19,077 --> 02:10:23,617
We are not doing any wrong thing.
It's for the good of people

1314
02:10:23,982 --> 02:10:27,293
What good of people you'll do
by killing the CM? You'll be hanged.

1315
02:10:28,921 --> 02:10:30,298
We aren't killing him.

1316
02:10:30,589 --> 02:10:33,763
He'll be wearing the bullet proof
jacket and we'll shoot on his chest.

1317
02:10:34,893 --> 02:10:37,737
You have gone mad.
What if you miss the target.

1318
02:10:38,430 --> 02:10:39,966
He has never missed a target.

1319
02:10:43,202 --> 02:10:44,408
Don't be afraid, Mahak.

1320
02:10:44,736 --> 02:10:48,206
It has been properly planned and
there is nothing to worry about.

1321
02:10:48,607 --> 02:10:50,382
We are getting one million for it.

1322
02:10:52,010 --> 02:10:53,148
This is the plan.

1323
02:10:53,679 --> 02:10:56,023
You'll wait for us
at the V.T. Station.

1324
02:10:56,582 --> 02:10:59,028
After finishing our job we
will come to V.T. station.

1325
02:10:59,418 --> 02:11:01,261
From there we shall go
to Kulu-Manali.

1326
02:11:01,620 --> 02:11:02,894
And we shall get married there.

1327
02:11:03,422 --> 02:11:06,426
Careful, Ali.
Be very careful.

1328
02:14:03,535 --> 02:14:06,482
Mahak. Do you know what has Ali done.
He shot the Chief Minister.

1329
02:14:06,838 --> 02:14:11,253
No!

1330
02:14:11,476 --> 02:14:13,251

God! What has happened?

1333
02:14:44,309 --> 02:14:50,316
What happened, dear?

1334
02:15:05,464 --> 02:15:09,810
Help me, God.
Forgive me, God.

1335
02:15:19,277 --> 02:15:21,188
Completion of formalities
will take about? hour.

1336
02:15:21,446 --> 02:15:22,652
You can wait outside.

1337
02:15:26,118 --> 02:15:29,292
Hello Veer, my son ! Where
are you? How are you?

1338

I-jiili'?

1339
02:15:36,361 --> 02:15:39,467
The one who had come in search
of my brother and your son

1340
02:15:42,767 --> 02:15:44,405
he has no difficulty now.

1341
02:15:50,709 --> 02:15:52,882
He is no longer in this world, papa.

1342
02:15:54,346 --> 02:15:56,622
I understand your pain, my son.

1343
02:15:58,650 --> 02:16:00,527
My soldier son is there too.

1344
02:16:01,887 --> 02:16:04,299
He will take good care
of his younger brother.

1345
02:16:04,756 --> 02:16:07,168
He'll love him very much.
You don't worry.

1346
02:16:07,559 --> 02:16:10,733
But listen, son.
Don't cry. Don't cry, Veer.

1347
02:16:11,363 --> 02:16:16,403
They had started this war.
You should finish it.

1348
02:16:17,636 --> 02:16:20,048
<i>Y es, papa.
-Don‘t spare them.</i>

1349

Son ! Where are you now?
lam coming to you.

1350
02:16:27,379 --> 02:16:31,725
I miss you very much.
I want to meet you - see you.

1351
02:16:47,199 --> 02:16:53,480
Mahak!
What happened!

1352
02:16:54,539 --> 02:16:56,815
<i>Someone shot Alan before my own eyes</i>

1353
02:16:59,644 --> 02:17:02,090
And I could not even recognize
the he is my brother.

1354
02:17:06,117 --> 02:17:08,324
Because for 3 years
I did not remember anything.

1355
02:17:09,854 --> 02:17:14,997
I-Iwwﬂ-.

1356
02:17:19,064 --> 02:17:22,477
No Ali. Don't punish yourself.

1357
02:17:28,440 --> 02:17:30,647
Don't you want to see Munna happy?

1358
02:17:32,911 --> 02:17:34,219
I want to see him happy.

1359
02:17:34,813 --> 02:17:39,319
Wherever Munna is
he's happier than all of us.

1360
02:17:41,152 --> 02:17:44,190
You took good care of him.

1361
02:17:46,558 --> 02:17:49,903
Now God wants that Munna
should take care of you.

1362
02:17:50,795 --> 02:17:57,644
And if you keep hurting like you
It will cause too much pain to Munna.

1363
02:17:58,236 --> 02:18:02,412
'“'°' ' “ZIIEZ-ail' Zfiymfigi- Mwma

1364
02:18:20,058 --> 02:18:23,938


1365
02:18:29,234 --> 02:18:32,374
With whom?
-With me.

1366
02:18:38,343 --> 02:18:39,754
What could I do?

1367
02:18:40,945 --> 02:18:44,085
You know what happened
to her after you left.

1368
02:18:45,550 --> 02:18:47,120
How much the police tortured her.

1369
02:18:48,153 --> 02:18:50,759
She was made to stay in the
crime branch from morning till evening.

1370
02:18:52,090 --> 02:18:53,535
They used to misbehave with her.

1371
02:18:54,459 --> 02:18:56,700
She was asked to tell
"where is your lover?

1372
02:18:57,228 --> 02:18:58,969
He has run away after killing
the Chief Minister.

1373
02:18:59,998 --> 02:19:03,241
No, I didn't shoot the C.M.

1374
02:19:03,735 --> 02:19:04,975
I know it.

1375
02:19:07,072 --> 02:19:08,517
She was thrown out of the hostel.

1376
02:19:09,074 --> 02:19:11,987
Nobody wanted to give her shelter.

1377
02:19:13,611 --> 02:19:15,318
She was going to commit suicide.

1378
02:19:18,450 --> 02:19:19,895
That's why I supported her.

1379
02:19:22,087 --> 02:19:23,862
You did it right, lnder.

1380
02:19:30,929 --> 02:19:32,374
But where were you all these years?

1381
02:19:34,766 --> 02:19:37,042
I was found in Rajgarh 3 years ago.

1382
02:19:38,970 --> 02:19:40,449
I don't remember anything.

1383
02:19:42,240 --> 02:19:48,122
There I met my papa, ma and a girl

1384
02:19:48,380 --> 02:19:52,658
Muskan - I was engaged to her.

1385
02:19:54,619 --> 02:20:02,595
I had come here for Azan.

1386
02:20:04,062 --> 02:20:09,444
I came here for my Munna.
And he is no more.

1387
02:20:12,036 --> 02:20:14,573
Come.
He is there.

1388
02:20:16,307 --> 02:20:20,221


1389
02:20:21,079 --> 02:20:24,458
Ali! Forget him for now.
You run away from here.

1390
02:20:25,483 --> 02:20:27,895


1391
02:21:11,463 --> 02:21:13,170
lnder, what happened?

1392
02:21:13,565 --> 02:21:17,479
You're asking me?
After killing C.M., you're asking me.

1393
02:21:17,836 --> 02:21:20,442
I didn't shoot him.
-Then who shot him?

1394
02:21:21,372 --> 02:21:24,046
Because of you we will have
to spend our life in jail.

1395
02:21:24,375 --> 02:21:27,584
I didn't even fire a shot.
I swear by you.

1396
02:21:27,846 --> 02:21:32,317
I swear by Mahak, by Munna
By God - I didn't kill him.

1397
02:21:33,184 --> 02:21:36,165
YQillil
HIT

1398
02:21:44,028 --> 02:21:45,268
I did that!

1399
02:22:45,023 --> 02:22:47,936
I'll not let you go so easily.

1400
02:22:48,359 --> 02:22:55,470
Commissioner, I thought it was your
plan and you think I killed C.M.

1401
02:22:56,234 --> 02:22:59,681
No I didn't kill C.M.
Now I remember everything.

1402
02:22:59,938 --> 02:23:01,884
You are lying!
What do you remember?

1403
02:23:02,240 --> 02:23:05,153
That you shot C.M. here and
his brain came out of here!

1404
02:23:05,476 --> 02:23:06,580
You did that, Ali!

1405
02:23:06,911 --> 02:23:09,892
Lﬂiiiiliif

1406
02:23:10,214 --> 02:23:11,124
You were standing on the top.

1407
02:23:11,416 --> 02:23:14,625
Then my bullet would have entered
here and came out from here.

1408
02:23:15,453 --> 02:23:17,364
But bullet went from here
and came out from top.

1409
02:23:20,758 --> 02:23:23,864
Sir, I didn't kill C.M.
He was killed by lnder.

Iii“
fﬂjfilikﬂllil

1411
02:23:26,898 --> 02:23:30,038
Look this sir.
He fired 5 bullets on me.

1412
02:23:30,568 --> 02:23:31,512
Why?

1413
02:23:35,773 --> 02:23:41,689
Even if I agree with you
how will you prove all that?

1414
02:23:44,182 --> 02:23:49,029
We had recorded all our
meetings with you.

1415
02:23:49,354 --> 02:23:51,595
Y-llllltiqp
Ylni.

1416
02:23:53,424 --> 02:23:54,903
We didn't trust you, sir.

1417
02:23:57,562 --> 02:24:00,270
lam sure even today
lnder would be recording.

1418
02:24:00,765 --> 02:24:02,073
Give me only two hours

1419
02:24:03,534 --> 02:24:05,514
I will give you all the proof.

1420
02:24:08,172 --> 02:24:13,349
All right Ali. I'm giving
just two hours to you.

1421
02:24:13,678 --> 02:24:15,089
Remember. Only two hours.

1422
02:24:19,817 --> 02:24:24,459
Mahak, where is lnder?
- lnder is not in home?

1423
02:24:25,123 --> 02:24:33,099
Don't you want to know who killed
C.M., Munna and who tried to kill me?

1424
02:24:34,432 --> 02:24:36,412
Who would like to know this
more than me?

1425
02:24:37,268 --> 02:24:38,508
You know him.

1426
02:24:40,605 --> 02:24:44,314
- Y_-'w-m-.

1427
02:24:48,880 --> 02:24:49,915
You are lying.

1428
02:24:50,281 --> 02:24:57,529
No. I'm not lying. I remember
everything. He was lnder.

1429
02:24:58,723 --> 02:24:59,997
How could I believe?

1430
02:25:00,825 --> 02:25:03,601


1431
02:25:03,928 --> 02:25:05,601
<i>“Mm</i>

1432
02:25:25,149 --> 02:25:31,532
While dealing with C.M. you were
the first to agree to take one million.

1433
02:25:31,856 --> 02:25:35,235
This means, you needed that money
more than your friend.

1434
02:25:38,796 --> 02:25:44,212
If you think that for 500,000
I'll betray my friend

1435
02:25:44,502 --> 02:25:49,542
I'll sell my soul - I'll shoot
C.M. -then you are right.

1436
02:25:57,448 --> 02:25:59,223
Hello, Mahak.
What are you doing?

1437
02:25:59,784 --> 02:26:03,322
lnder, where are you?
-What happened.

1438
02:26:03,721 --> 02:26:11,299
You Ali!
I hate you.

1439
02:26:18,536 --> 02:26:20,675


1440
02:26:21,639 --> 02:26:22,982
I remembered everything.

1441
02:26:24,242 --> 02:26:31,126
You killed the C.M. You attempted
to kill me. And Munna

1442
02:26:31,482 --> 02:26:33,894
You wait there.
Don't go anywhere.

1443
02:26:34,252 --> 02:26:36,823
Yes. It's your turn to go.

1444
02:26:37,822 --> 02:26:41,531
Come soon.
I'm waiting for you.

1445
02:26:42,059 --> 02:26:45,939
Sir! Ali has reached Bombay.
-What nonsense are you talking.

1446
02:26:46,264 --> 02:26:49,507
He is in the neighborhood now.
-You people are useless.

1447
02:26:50,001 --> 02:26:51,878
Do you know how dangerous
he can be for me.

1448
02:26:52,336 --> 02:26:55,874
He killed all the men I had sent
for killing him in his village.

1449
02:26:56,174 --> 02:26:58,882
Sir, he had escaped there
but he can't live now.

1450
02:27:34,812 --> 02:27:38,259
Listen. Today nobody will
come out of their home today.

1451
02:28:26,998 --> 02:28:29,535
Where are you hiding?
Come out.

1452
02:28:35,406 --> 02:28:36,384
Surround him.

1453
02:30:31,255 --> 02:30:32,928
Mahak! Where is the tape?

1454
02:31:42,960 --> 02:31:45,236
Everything happens for good.

1455
02:31:46,964 --> 02:31:49,570
I have no complaint with my life.

1456
02:31:51,035 --> 02:31:52,912
Will you do one thing for me.

1457
02:31:58,809 --> 02:32:01,813
Kill him.

1458
02:32:03,848 --> 02:32:05,987
Now there is nothing left.

1459
02:32:09,687 --> 02:32:13,499
You go back to the village
to your parents.

1460
02:32:15,359 --> 02:32:23,574
There should be 'muskan' (smile)
in your eyes not tears.

02:35:29,386 --> 02:35:33,129
Iloylluiiblnllrl
I?!'

1462
02:35:33,657 --> 02:35:36,831
If I hate anybody in the
world'that's you.

1463
02:35:40,164 --> 02:35:44,909
From childhood till now you
got everything that I wanted.

1464
02:35:45,269 --> 02:35:47,112
You were ahead of me in every sphere.

1465
02:35:52,543 --> 02:35:57,390
I liked Mahak. I liked Mahak very
much - but she liked you.

1466
02:35:59,917 --> 02:36:03,057
Iluup imam-visual.

1467
02:36:18,802 --> 02:36:23,615
When you two used to embrace each
other I used to feel jealous.

1468
02:36:25,876 --> 02:36:31,849
I tried to kill you but you survived.
Your brother found it out.

1469
02:36:32,883 --> 02:36:37,332
I wanted to kill both of you in
Muslim temple but you escaped

1470
02:36:37,688 --> 02:36:38,894
Your brother was killed.

1471
02:36:41,558 --> 02:36:43,595
I wanted Rahim uncle to be killed.

1472
02:36:44,128 --> 02:36:46,199
I killed Chief Minister too.

1473
02:36:48,532 --> 02:36:51,672
And because of you
even Mahak died today.

1474
02:36:54,371 --> 02:37:01,550
I did all these things for Mahak.

1475
02:37:02,780 --> 02:37:04,054
For money.

1476
02:37:09,019 --> 02:37:15,095
Look I've even your good luck charm.
Who will save you today?

1477
02:37:25,202 --> 02:37:27,148
I'll be saved by that
who want you killed.

1478
02:37:34,878 --> 02:37:41,921
Because even He know that someone
should destroy scoundrels like you.

1479
02:37:42,352 --> 02:37:45,856
Had you done all this for the sake
of love I'd have forgiven you.

1480
02:37:46,857 --> 02:37:52,136
But you did it for money.
For your selfish reasons.

1481
02:37:55,199 --> 02:38:00,148
I looked after you like a brother
and you betrayed me.

1482
02:38:01,805 --> 02:38:05,218
You killed Munna!

1483
02:38:06,910 --> 02:38:08,787
You betrayed Mahak.

1484
02:38:10,380 --> 02:38:14,726
Only for money you had
Rahim uncle killed!

1485
02:38:15,586 --> 02:38:16,997
Take the money with you.

1486
02:38:17,354 --> 02:38:19,800
I y-ll

1487
02:38:20,057 --> 02:38:22,833
Take the money to hell.

HIZKIDIIHI

1489
02:38:49,219 --> 02:38:50,857
Kill that bastard.

1490
02:39:23,287 --> 02:39:25,324
Sir, why have you come here?

1491
02:39:25,689 --> 02:39:28,863
Killer of the late C.M. is here and
you are asking why I've come here?

1492
02:39:29,159 --> 02:39:30,331
Please sir, you go from here.

1493
02:39:30,627 --> 02:39:32,971
He has become murderous!
Your life is in danger.

1494
02:39:33,230 --> 02:39:35,904
The killer of my guru and
country's biggest leader is here.

1495
02:39:36,466 --> 02:39:38,707
I want to see him die with my eyes.

1496
02:39:39,570 --> 02:39:41,914
Okay, please. You come over here.

1497
02:39:49,846 --> 02:39:52,019
Listen to me carefully.

1498
02:39:52,416 --> 02:39:54,828
You must be arrested him alive.
He has got all proofs.

1499
02:40:01,491 --> 02:40:06,964
You will get 1 million for
shooting on the chest of C.M..

1500
02:40:08,432 --> 02:40:14,542
But if you shoot this bullet on his
head then I shall give you 5 million.

1501
02:40:16,773 --> 02:40:20,448
Why are you making this offer to me?
You could have called Ali too.

1502
02:40:20,711 --> 02:40:21,655
Stop all that!

1503
02:40:21,979 --> 02:40:25,552
How many TVs can you stop.
The entire area has seen this.

1504
02:40:25,916 --> 02:40:29,523
Then kill everybody.
This is my order.

1505
02:40:31,955 --> 02:40:36,199
You have slapped me.
You slapped Chief Minister face.

1506
02:40:36,526 --> 02:40:39,837
No. This was laws slap on
the face of crime.

1507
02:40:40,631 --> 02:40:43,134
Commissioner, I'll have
your uniform removed.

1508
02:40:43,533 --> 02:40:48,573
My uniform isn't a chair of leaders
that one gets for five years.

1509
02:40:48,972 --> 02:40:50,781
I'll show you its power.

1510
02:41:37,220 --> 02:41:39,131
Your Veer has come back, Muskan !

1511
02:41:53,503 --> 02:41:56,245
What is the matter?
-Look? Who has come?

1512
02:41:56,606 --> 02:41:58,643
Oh my son Veer has come!

1513
02:42:04,481 --> 02:42:06,483
You have come my son !

1514
02:42:24,101 --> 02:42:28,311
I knew you'll definitely come back.

1515
02:42:32,943 --> 02:42:38,416
Papa, my name is Ali.
lam a Muslim.

1516
02:42:40,917 --> 02:42:44,023
