Can you play the track a little lower?

267
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:36,468
Lower?

268
01:00:37,137 --> 01:00:38,846
Lower the track in the headphones

269
01:00:59,993 --> 01:01:04,413
l am devoted to you my love

270
01:01:04,539 --> 01:01:08,709

With you by my side, my love

You turn the night into day

279
01:02:09,479 --> 01:02:13,565

Your love sets me on fire

When we're together l have no rest

284
01:03:23,261 --> 01:03:25,971
You light up my desire

285
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:34,516
Hi. Avit

You dance really well

288
01:05:39,481 --> 01:05:41,023

Not for me thanks

292
01:05:55,288 --> 01:05:56,705
How long have you been here?

293
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,207
ln Bombay?

294
01:06:00,877 --> 01:06:01,752
ls she a friend of yours?

295
01:06:01,795 --> 01:06:03,128
Yes she is

296
01:06:04,005 --> 01:06:04,963
You didn't even introduce me

297
01:06:05,131 --> 01:06:06,590
You didn't give us a chance to

298
01:06:06,716 --> 01:06:08,550
l was just giving her some advice

299
01:12:43,405 --> 01:12:44,405
How much are the bananas?

300
01:12:44,614 --> 01:12:45,447
Thirty rupees

301
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:46,323
Thirty?

302
01:12:49,327 --> 01:12:54,039
Do you think you will have to pay
a high price for your mistakes?

303
01:13:44,215 --> 01:13:45,382
How are you?

304
01:13:46,009 --> 01:13:47,301
lt's been ages

305
01:13:47,427 --> 01:13:49,136
You haven't called or anything

306
01:13:49,304 --> 01:13:50,721
Sorry

307
01:13:51,306 --> 01:13:52,222
So tell me

308
01:13:52,349 --> 01:13:53,724
What's happened?

309
01:13:53,850 --> 01:13:54,892
Nothing, l've just been at home

310
01:13:55,018 --> 01:13:56,101
Have you heard from Jay?

311
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:58,312
He hasn't called?

312
01:13:58,438 --> 01:14:00,397
No news at all?

313
01:14:01,816 --> 01:14:04,360
From the ten husbands in this competition

314
01:14:04,652 --> 01:14:07,363
The one who is strongest will survive

315
01:14:14,412 --> 01:14:15,412
Hello?

316
01:14:16,456 --> 01:14:17,414
l'm sorry

317
01:14:18,124 --> 01:14:19,958
l was assuming this flat would be vacant

318
01:14:20,919 --> 01:14:22,503
The lease is up

319
01:14:22,629 --> 01:14:24,838
So you have to vacate the flat

320
01:14:26,591 --> 01:14:27,675
When?

321
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:29,843
This weekend?

322
01:14:31,846 --> 01:14:33,639
ls it OK if l have a quick look around?

323
01:14:34,391 --> 01:14:35,557
Yes go ahead

324
01:15:07,757 --> 01:15:09,341
Good morning, are you hungry?

325
01:15:09,467 --> 01:15:10,300
Yes

326
01:15:10,385 --> 01:15:12,261
l'll get you some breakfast

327
01:15:12,679 --> 01:15:13,679
- Aggie!
- Yes?

328
01:15:13,805 --> 01:15:14,805
Come on

329
01:15:31,656 --> 01:15:33,240
Can l take your number?

330
01:15:52,052 --> 01:15:53,594
So this is what a shoot looks like

331
01:15:54,387 --> 01:15:56,013
Wow, look at all those lights!

332
01:15:56,139 --> 01:15:59,391
Yes, it's very different to rehearsals

333
01:16:09,986 --> 01:16:12,529
This is playback from 'A' Camera

334
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:16,950
They're good dancers

335
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:18,494
You think so?

336
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:44,103
Thousands have been destroyed!

337
01:16:44,312 --> 01:16:45,729
So many hunted!

338
01:16:46,106 --> 01:16:49,024
All the boys are keen to impress

339
01:16:49,567 --> 01:16:51,777
An endless queue, right and left

340
01:16:51,986 --> 01:16:53,737
They beg for love

341
01:16:53,863 --> 01:16:56,990
Oh there will be tension!

342
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:10,921
lt's good to come to shoots like that

343
01:17:12,257 --> 01:17:15,134
You can make good contacts

344
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:17,386
People who can help your career

345
01:17:19,848 --> 01:17:23,726
One thing you need to do
is get a Cine Dancer Card

346
01:17:25,061 --> 01:17:26,687
lt's very important

347
01:17:26,813 --> 01:17:28,605
l can help you get one

348
01:17:29,149 --> 01:17:31,567
- All dancers have them?
- Yes all dancers

349
01:17:31,693 --> 01:17:33,027
lt costs money

350
01:17:33,611 --> 01:17:34,987
30,000 rupees to start with

351
01:17:35,822 --> 01:17:40,993
Then after that once you start getting work
you can pay off the rest in installments

352
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:43,871
l don't have that kind of money

353
01:17:44,497 --> 01:17:46,874
Take the 30,000 from me

354
01:17:47,751 --> 01:17:50,294
Once you start working
you can pay me off

355
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:52,338
You'll take it?

356
01:17:53,089 --> 01:17:54,340
Promise?

357
01:22:27,739 --> 01:22:29,865
Just put it down

358
01:27:32,794 --> 01:27:34,420
Shall we go inside?

359
01:28:47,827 --> 01:28:48,911
Trishna?

360
01:28:49,037 --> 01:28:50,079
Yes?

361
01:28:52,332 --> 01:28:54,166
Do you know Jay Singh from before?

362
01:28:55,502 --> 01:28:56,585
Yes

363
01:28:57,379 --> 01:28:58,671
Where do you know him from?

364
01:29:03,301 --> 01:29:05,052
From another hotel

365
01:29:06,888 --> 01:29:09,056
Before this you were in Mumbai right?

366
01:29:13,436 --> 01:29:15,229
Which hotel in Mumbai?

367
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:19,274
l was staying at a friend's house

368
01:29:21,986 --> 01:29:23,612
l see

369
01:38:16,688 --> 01:38:19,565
This is the truth

370
01:38:19,899 --> 01:38:24,361
The truth love has taught me

371
01:38:24,738 --> 01:38:29,158
My love, you showed me
how the world really is

372
01:38:58,438 --> 01:39:01,940
You showed me a place
where the storm never ends

373
01:39:03,234 --> 01:39:07,321
You showed me a world
where the night never ends

374
01:39:07,572 --> 01:39:12,076
You took me to the realm of love

375
01:39:12,327 --> 01:39:16,455
With you by my side,
l left this world behind

376
01:39:20,085 --> 01:39:23,462
Every moment l was filled with fear

377
01:39:24,881 --> 01:39:27,883
Every step l took made me more afraid

378
01:39:29,052 --> 01:39:33,013
My love, you turned my day into night

379
01:39:33,848 --> 01:39:39,228
My love, why did you do this to me?

380
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:21,729
You showed me a place
where the storm never ends

381
01:40:22,355 --> 01:40:26,191
You showed me a world
where the night never ends

382
01:40:26,693 --> 01:40:30,404
You took me to the realm of love

383
01:40:31,448 --> 01:40:36,160
With you by my side,
l left this world behind

384
01:40:39,330 --> 01:40:42,708
Every moment l was filled with fear

385
01:40:44,127 --> 01:40:47,713
Every step l took made me more afraid

386
01:40:48,173 --> 01:40:52,760
My love, you turned my day into night

387
01:40:52,969 --> 01:40:57,556
My love, why did you do this to me?

388

Get me some water

So where's your husband?

Who?

418
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:14,902
Everybody knows that l'm living off you
