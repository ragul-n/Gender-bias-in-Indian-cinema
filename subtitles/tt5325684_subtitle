1
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,460
'We are capable of both,
loving as well as hating.'

2
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,420
'But it is hatred which requires
more audaciousness, not love.'

3
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,920
Someone sent me this to blackmail me.

4
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,090
You have destroyed my life, Aryan.

5
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,300
I am going away.

6
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,210
Away from you and everything else.

7
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,960
Wait, Tasha!

8
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,550
Just listen to me! For God's sake..

9
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,130
You don't need to go anywhere!

10
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,420
Tasha, stop it!

11
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,920
What's the use of stopping me now?

12
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,210
You should have stopped me that day.

13
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,670
And for that matter yourself too.

14
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,340
All this is meaningless now.

15
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,920
Just give me some time.
I will set everything right.

16
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,250
Just wait.
Give me some time.

17
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,090
If you haven't taken me back then..

18
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,050
..you wouldn't have to
ask me to give you time now.

19
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,050
Tasha, you..

20
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,670
So, I was right.

21
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,710
You are here,
enjoying with your new b*t*h.

22
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,590
You are getting this
all wrong, Rishma.

23
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,210
It is you who had this all wrong.

24
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,250
Changing sheets is much easier than..

25
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,590
..changing the lover
you enjoy between the sheets.

26
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,050
If you are loving together..

27
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,420
Then you can die together as well.

28
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,550
Rishma!
Let go of the gun!

29
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,420
- Put the gun down!
- Leave the gun, Aryan!

30
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,630
Rishma, let go of the gun!

31
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,380
- Leave me.
- You will get hurt.

32
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,420
Leave the gun, I say!

33
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,460
- Just..
- Just leave me!

34
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,500
- Leave the gun, Aryan!
- Let go of the gun!

35
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,840
What have you done, Aryan!

36
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,000
'Stories and life
have this in common..'

37
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,130
'They both begin with
an aim to come to an end.'

38
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,420
'And their end is decided
at the beginning.'

39
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,590
You missed me a lot?

40
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,250
I missed my morning kiss.

41
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,500
You have managed to
bribe my lips somehow.

42
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,710
They tend to favor you more than me.

43
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,550
I have the same complaint.

44
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,840
You love the water, don't you?

45
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,090
So do you.

46
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,420
Me? How?

47
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,130
Like every other human being..

48
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,630
..65 percent of my body
is also made up of water.

49
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,380
Oh.

50
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,420
And you love my body.
Don't you?

51
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,630
Yes. But not 65 percent..

52
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,840
100 percent.

53
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,340
You know what, Aryan?

54
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,920
Water relaxes not just
my body but my mind as well.

55
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,380
Like I now have the complete plan of..

56
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,630
..how to go about with
the launch of Senorita Cosmetics.

57
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,130
But for that,
we will require a fresh face.

58
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,130
A fresh face?

59
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,250
Well, there is just one
person in Lake District..

60
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,340
..who can find a fresh
face at such a short notice.

61
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,460
You don't seem to be satisfied.

62
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,420
What else do you want from me?

63
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,460
You know what I want, Rajveer.

64
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,550
I want to be the face of Senorita.

65
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,000
Don't worry, senorita.

66
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:56,590
You shouldn't worry about such
minuscule things in big countries.

67
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,630
You will be the face of this campaign.

68
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,630
Bye.

69
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,250
A new face?
But why do we need a new face?

70
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,170
Because this is what
the client demands.

71
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,840
And we have committed
to fulfill their demands.

72
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,170
But bro, I too have
made a commitment to Monica.

73
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,050
That she will be the
face of this campaign.

74
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,130
Rajveer try to understand..

75
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,960
Promises made in the bedroom hold
no value in the boardroom, Rajveer.

76
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,170
After this, forget the bedroom..

77
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,920
..she won't even agree
to meet me in a boardroom.

78
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,550
You are an expert when it
comes to cajoling and convincing.

79
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,210
You can easily handle Monica.

80
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,000
At the moment, we want you to
concentrate on finding us a new face.

81
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,800
We need a face that is intoxicating
as well as mesmerizing.

82
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,880
A face that is intoxicating
as well as mesmerizing.

83
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,500
"Everyone's heart
feels lonely without me."

84
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,050
"Everyone's eyes are
all thirsty without me."

85
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,090
"Everyone's heart
feels lonely without me."

86
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,340
"Everyone's eyes are
all thirsty without me."

87
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,590
"It catches you unaware!"

88
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,840
"Beloved, listen.."

89
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,090
"You make me crazy.."

90
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,460
"You make me crazy.. in love."

91
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:46,550
"You make me crazy.."

92
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,960
"You make me crazy.. in love."

93
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:22,500
"Love should get free
rein over the heart."

94
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,250
"Use your lips to know
what my lips want to convey."

95
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,920
"Your face is always there in my eyes."

96
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:36,590
"Deep are my desires
and the climate is crazy."

97
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,130
"Love plays strange games."

98
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,000
"You undid me with love."

99
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,250
"Evenings are uneventful without me."

100
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,380
"Stars feel irrelevant without me."

101
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,710
"Love feels helpless without me."

102
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,130
"Beloved, listen.."

103
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,250
"You make me crazy.."

104
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,920
"You make me crazy.. in love."

105
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:08,710
"You make me crazy.."

106
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,880
"You make me crazy.. in love."

107
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,840
"You make me crazy.."

108
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,130
"You make me crazy.. in love."

109
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
Hey, baby..

110
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,090
Come with me to my place.

111
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,840
If you strip live for me..

112
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,250
I'll have you covered in
money and instead of a sheet.

113
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,050
I do strip to earn a living, mister.

114
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:04,090
But I have never stripped
my dignity off me.

115
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,130
At the right price..

116
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,500
You'll remove that too.

117
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,420
Leave my hand.

118
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,500
You b*t*h.

119
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,170
I said, leave my hand.

120
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,090
Let go of her hand.

121
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,630
Listen dude.. don't be a hero.
Get going.

122
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,340
Listen..

123
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,630
I sometimes have to be a hero
to teach loafers like you a lesson.

124
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,050
Let go of her hand.

125
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,210
Now.. get lost.

126
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,000
Otherwise, I'll hit you so hard
that your pain will tell the salve..

127
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:05,630
"I cannot heal myself, and
you aren't capable enough to heal me."

128
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,670
You'll have to pay for this.

129
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,590
Following me?

130
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,840
Hmm.

131
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,050
If you want me to.

132
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
Don't worry.
Just making sure you are fine.

133
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,630
Your method is different..

134
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,590
But your intention is the same.

135
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:27,420
Not every club dancer agrees
to dance on anyone's tunes.

136
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,500
We are here to show you the way.

137
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,920
- She is damn hot.
- I know, I know, I know.

138
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,340
I did come to the
club to watch you dance.

139
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,420
But I neither have the desire
to make you dance to my tunes..

140
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,420
..nor do I have desire
to dance on anyone's.

141
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,800
Anyways, good night.

142
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:49,960
I am sorry.

143
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,420
Instead of thanking
you for helping me..

144
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,670
I got suspicious of you.

145
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:04,800
You know there is
no cure for suspicion.

146
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,380
Or there is.

147
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,590
What?

148
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:13,630
Hot, streaming, strong coffee.

149
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,840
If you are work two shifts
then when do you sleep?

150
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,880
Wait a second.

151
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,000
I hope you aren't a vampire.

152
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,340
Don't worry I won't suck your blood.

153
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,880
I prefer coffee.

154
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,090
Anyway, staying alone I have
learnt to make stellar coffee as well.

155
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,250
You stay alone?

156
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,050
Yes, I am alone but not lonely.

157
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,210
And as far as sleep is concerned..

158
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,800
I do sleep, and I dream too.

159
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,210
And sleep anyway tends to elude you..

160
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,500
..when your dreams remain unfulfilled.

161
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,340
Well, if you don't mind, can I know..

162
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,880
..which dreams make you sleepless?

163
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,550
Dreams of touching the
sky and shinning like a big star.

164
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,000
I want to be a star.

165
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,420
But..

166
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,630
But?

167
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,960
Before helping you in touching
the sky, people wanted to touch you.

168
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,420
So, I preferred to stay on the ground.

169
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
Well, in that case, you are in luck.

170
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,130
Why?

171
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,670
I don't have dreams of my own.

172
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,840
But I do fulfill dreams others have.

173
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,800
I didn't get you.

174
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,500
If you give me an
opportunity to explain..

175
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,380
..that I guarantee you
that you'll touch the sky.

176
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,500
Smile..

177
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,670
Okay, side ways..

178
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,550
I've provided you with the sky.

179
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,840
Now it's your turn to shine.

180
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,130
Aren't you tired of
stars pretending that..

181
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,340
..they like a particular cola drink
or need a certain fairness cream?

182
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,170
I don't think normal public believes..

183
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,880
..that stars really use
the products they endorse.

184
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,420
Normal public will
believe in a new face..

185
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,550
That is beautiful as well as fresh.

186
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,130
And with her endorsement,
they will surely buy our product.

187
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,420
Yeah, we totally agree.

188
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
But have you found such a fresh face?

189
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,000
I am sure we will.

190
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,000
We have it.

191
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:52,880
Well, people usually
apologize when they are late.

192
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,590
But I am not sorry that I am late.

193
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,420
Because the reason I am late..

194
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,130
Or rather,
the beautiful reason I am late..

195
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,210
Lies in this envelope.

196
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,300
And if we don't sign
this reason at the earliest..

197
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,460
..then according to me,
it will be too late.

198
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,590
She is a star.

199
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:33,920
And we should sign her at the earliest,
before anyone else spots her.

200
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,000
Are you sure?

201
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,420
I am so sure that I will guarantee it.

202
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,170
What if it doesn't work out?

203
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,550
If it doesn't work
then the loss is mine.

204
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:55,920
But if I am proven right,
you will have to pay me double.

205
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,550
Done.

206
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,250
We don't have any risk in this.

207
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,380
And if the product works,
we stand to gain.

208
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,090
- Then gentlemen, we have a deal.
- Okay.

209
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,000
Great.

210
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,340
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

211
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,920
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

212
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,130
- Well done.
- Aryan..

213
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,670
You should keep business
and pleasure separated.

214
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,210
You have taken a risk worth millions
in business for Rajveer's pleasure.

215
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,710
People shed blood for blood ties.

216
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,090
This is just money, Rishma.

217
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,630
You are the best, bro.

218
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,050
And come on,
Rishma.. don't be so grumpy.

219
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,460
Come on.
You need a hug.

220
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,590
- Stop it Rajveer.
- Okay, I'll take you out for dinner.

221
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,800
- No.
- Dinner is on me.

222
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,340
What will you have?
India, Japanese, Thai.

223
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,250
- Come on Rishma smile now, please.
- Okay.

224
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,420
That's like you.

225
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,420
What do we do now, Aryan?

226
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,920
We cannot call the police either.

227
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,630
No one will believe
that this was an accident.

228
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,380
I am so scared, Aryan.

229
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:20,340
I feel as if Rishma's
dead eyes glaring at me.

230
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,670
They are accusing me.

231
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,000
Don't be crazy, okay?

232
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,920
She is dead.

233
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,210
We are alive.
We have to survive this.

234
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,550
We will have to dispose her body.

235
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,800
We have to get rid of it.

236
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,590
No one should find her dead body.

237
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:36,960
Do you understand?

238
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,670
If I knew that..

239
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:48,250
The price to live my dreams
was someone else's death..

240
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,960
Then I would never have such dreams.

241
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,420
Never.

242
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,090
Hats off to you.

243
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,130
You've handled this really well.

244
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,420
This girl is magic.

245
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,420
For the first time in my life,
I'm happy to pay double.

246
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,590
Trust me you still got a good deal,
my friend.

247
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,670
Time will tell her true value.

248
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,340
Only time will tell her true value,
my friend.

249
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,500
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

250
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,210
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

251
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,590
I can't believe it, Rajveer.

252
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,590
It all feels like a dream.

253
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:32,500
Fulfilled dreams always
feel like a dream.

254
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,090
I just made you a promise.

255
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:43,590
And your talent and beauty
helped fulfill that promise.

256
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,210
I too make you a promise.

257
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,250
One day I shall repay
you for all you have done.

258
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,590
You have changed my life.

259
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,380
Ladies and gentlemen..
Can I have your attention please?

260
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,420
It's always said that behind
every successful man there is a woman.

261
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,250
But I am really-really lucky because
behind my success..

262
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,840
..there is not only one, but two women.

263
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,630
Rishma, thank you so much darling.

264
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,590
- Pleasure.
- Without you..

265
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,460
..this ad launch would
have not been possible.

266
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,670
Your welcome.

267
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,250
And now there is no heart
that is not ruled by Tasha.

268
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,960
So Tasha, welcome to the family.

269
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,130
Thank you.

270
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,210
Oh yes, and speaking of family..

271
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,420
I want to share another
big news with you.

272
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,590
And that big news is that my father,
Mr. Vikram Khurana..

273
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,210
..one of the most affluent
tycoons in the city..

274
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,670
..has been nominated
for the mayoral election.

275
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,880
So please,
join me in raising your glass to him..

276
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,250
And his victory.

277
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,380
How are you son?

278
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,500
- Wonderful to see you.
- Hi, dad.

279
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,460
Hi!

280
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,420
How are you son?

281
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,670
If you don't mind..

282
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,500
Won't you introduce
me to that beautiful girl?

283
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,710
Of course, dad.

284
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,170
Please come.

285
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,170
Dad, this is Tasha.

286
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,380
And Tasha, this is my dad.
Mr. Vikram Khurana.

287
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,630
See how unfortunate I am.

288
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:46,130
After such a long time, I am being
introduced to such a beautiful girl.

289
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,210
And that too, as dad.

290
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,800
Thanks for the flattery.

291
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,840
Today, after meeting
you for the first time..

292
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,000
..I have realized that
your sons have taken after you.

293
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,590
As the saying goes..

294
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:01,590
The apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

295
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,380
You are smart.

296
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,710
- I like it.
- Thank you.

297
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,670
Tasha, media is waiting.

298
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,380
Oh yes, you should go.

299
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,090
- Please carry on. Yes.
- Excuse me dad.

300
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,630
- Thank you.
- Fine Mathew

301
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,590
Apple reminds me..

302
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:21,550
Adam was thrown out of
heaven because of an apple.

303
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,420
I don't want your brother to suffer..

304
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,840
..the same consequences
because of this girl.

305
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,960
Be careful.

306
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,670
As a kid,
playing with toys is acceptable.

307
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:34,420
But if an adult obsesses over a toy,
he behaves childishly.

308
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,460
Keep an eye on him till
the mayoral elections aren't over.

309
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,460
You understand?

310
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:41,960
Got it, dad.

311
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:45,210
I'll make sure that you don't
face any problems because of Rajveer.

312
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,670
Hey Steve..

313
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,590
Let's discuss, come.

314
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,960
What are you doing?

315
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,130
Bro, you.. I want her.

316
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,050
I am crazy about her.

317
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,250
Be crazy, but don't do crazy things.

318
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,920
Win over her heart..

319
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,630
And her body will
automatically be yours.

320
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,170
Just look at Rishma and me.

321
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,880
Boardroom or bedroom..

322
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,420
There's not one thing
she won't do to satisfy me.

323
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,630
Make Tasha your Rishma.

324
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,840
It will not just benefit you,
but the company as well.

325
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,630
I hate it when you are right, bro.

326
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,170
Ok, who wants another drink?

327
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,630
Today I feel as if I have taken
the first step towards my destination.

328
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,590
I am so happy I found you.

329
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,130
You didn't find me, I found you.

330
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,340
And now that I have found you,
I won't let you go.

331
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,170
But you will have to let me go today.

332
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,960
My bed is calling me.

333
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:06,960
Really?

334
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:08,750
What a coincidence.

335
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,460
I think your bed is calling me too.

336
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,090
Sweet dreams.

337
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,460
You give me sleepless nights
and wish me sweet dreams as well?

338
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,750
Not fair.

339
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,050
Try to sleep.

340
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:37,960
Who knows,
we might meet again, in your dreams.

341
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,250
Alright. Good night.

342
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,050
Take care.

343
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,630
Bye-bye.

344
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,250
Bye.

345
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,170
Bye.

346
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:13,380
Well.. well..
well, what do we have here.

347
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,210
You look gorgeous tonight.

348
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,050
- Maybe you got tired.
- Leave me.

349
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,710
Oh my god! Go away.

350
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,710
Wassup.. Wassup..

351
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,170
Relax.. Relax..

352
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,550
Let me finish.

353
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,420
- Oh baby just come with us.
- Please.

354
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,750
We just wana talk to you.

355
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,960
- Come with us.
- Leave me.

356
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,590
Let her go.

357
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,170
Hey who is this guy?

358
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,500
Are you okay?

359
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,210
You shouldn't have.

360
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,170
Thank God,
you forgot your purse in my car.

361
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,300
Otherwise, I am scared just thinking
about what could have happened.

362
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:19,630
If you keep coming to my
rescue then I'll get used to it.

363
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,340
If you stay in such an area, then I'll
have to keep coming to rescue you.

364
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,840
If not here, then where will I stay?

365
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,210
Rajveer, I cannot afford this place.

366
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,750
Please try to understand.

367
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:47,170
You should just accept presents..

368
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,250
..without worrying
about the affordability.

369
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,170
Are you crazy?

370
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,630
I cannot accept such
an expensive present.

371
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,090
Fair enough.

372
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,840
Don't worry then.

373
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,340
One day,
I'll surely take a gift in turn.

374
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,300
Really?

375
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,590
So, you are giving with
an intention to take something.

376
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,800
No.

377
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,550
I am giving it with an
intention to attain something.

378
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,710
Anyway, when something
is so priceless..

379
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,920
..it has to be kept
both safe and close.

380
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:20,960
Tasha, I..

381
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,090
What, Rajveer?

382
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,210
I..

383
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,340
Yes, I was saying that it's late.

384
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,590
I should..

385
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,090
I should leave.

386
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,130
I'll see you.

387
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,460
Tomorrow?

388
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,420
No.

389
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:39,750
Tonight.

390
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,750
In my dreams.

391
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,300
Goodbye.

392
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,170
Rajveer..

393
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,210
Thank you.

394
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,170
Here he is.

395
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,420
Wassup' brother.

396
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,590
Thank you so much for your help.

397
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,920
Anything you need bro.

398
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,380
Let us know.

399
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,960
- We are leaving.
- Thank you.

400
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,300
Someone has rightly said:

401
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:45,380
Easy come, easy go.

402
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,670
I was easy..

403
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,090
That's why I lost you.

404
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,630
I think you've lost the plot, Monica.

405
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,960
Such kind of a behavior
doesn't suit you.

406
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,300
No, baby.

407
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,130
I am the twist in the plot.

408
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,960
And I'll make sure.. you lose.

409
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,050
You were right.

410
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,050
About Rajvir and Tasha.

411
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,130
Keep an eye on them.

412
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,420
Sure.

413
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,550
It's your money.

414
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,920
Hi!

415
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,420
What are you doing here?

416
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:14,340
I mean, how did you come in?

417
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,960
You should always keep
your house and your heart locked.

418
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,590
Otherwise,
thieves can sneak in easily.

419
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,920
There is nothing worth
stealing in the house.

420
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:26,750
And the heart is needed
for only two things.

421
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,500
To stay alive.

422
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,500
And to be stolen by the
one you wish to live with.

423
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,670
But there is a difference
between lovers and thieves.

424
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,210
Thieves don't return the stolen goods.

425
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:43,420
And lovers leave their heart behind
in exchange of the stolen heart.

426
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,050
Anyway, this is for you.

427
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,960
What is it?

428
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,550
One year's contract for
you and an advance cheque.

429
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,250
Thank you so much.

430
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,090
And this too is for you.

431
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,380
And that's a key to what?

432
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,880
To your new car.

433
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,090
It's parked outside.

434
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,210
Ah, now don't be a party-pooper and say:
I cannot accept it, blah blah blah.

435
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,710
Just take it and enjoy yourself.
Have fun.

436
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,090
I was going to say no such thing.

437
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,210
Because I know, both you
and your brother are the same.

438
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,090
And I will have to behave
the same with both of you.

439
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,710
Ah, excuse me.

440
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,920
Sure.

441
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,630
Yes Rishma, tell me.

442
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,380
Rishma..

443
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,550
You are neither answering
my calls not replying to my messages.

444
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,250
Tell me what the problem is.

445
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,960
Aryan, the problem
is that I know the truth.

446
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,300
And truth hurts.

447
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,170
Truth?

448
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,380
Truth about what?

449
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,050
Why are you being melodramatic?

450
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,550
I am being melodramatic..

451
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,880
Because you have
stopped being romantic.

452
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,500
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
forgotten the first anniversary..

453
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,300
..of the proposal you made to me
at this very place, on this very day.

454
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,050
Rishma..

455
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,460
"We were together, one day.."

456
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,920
"Lost in each other."

457
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:39,840
"What you had whispered
into my ears that day.."

458
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:47,050
"Don't say it to anyone else."

459
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:52,800
"You are mine, always stay mine."

460
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,920
"You are mine, always stay mine."

461
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:02,750
"Always be there for me."

462
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:08,050
"You are mine, always stay mine."

463
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,050
"There is one place in this world.."

464
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:31,960
"Which I find safe."

465
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:37,130
"There is one place in this world.."

466
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:41,750
"Which I find safe."

467
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,710
"Your arms.."

468
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,550
"That's how big my world is."

469
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:58,550
"Keep me in your arms."

470
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,880
"You are mine, always stay mine."

471
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,710
"You are mine, always stay mine."

472
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,880
"Always be there for me."

473
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,130
"You are mine, always stay mine."

474
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:41,380
"If not for you this heartache
would be unbearable."

475
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:46,460
"If I wasn't crazy about you,
in love with you.."

476
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:50,210
"I would have been long dead."

477
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:55,420
"You have more right over
me than I have on any given day."

478
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:59,960
"Make me a promise today.

479
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:02,170
"Goodbye.."

480
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:08,420
"Never say goodbye.."

481
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:19,670
"You are mine, always stay mine."

482
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,630
"You are mine, always stay mine."

483
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,800
"Always be there for me."

484
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:35,210
"You are mine, always stay mine."

485
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:55,590
I'll tell everyone that she's gone
on a retreat, like she often does.

486
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,340
Get in the car.

487
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,090
No, I am not going to.

488
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,960
Tasha, we cannot change what happened.

489
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:07,050
But what happens
now is in our control.

490
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,630
Let's just finish this.

491
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,590
No.

492
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,590
Oh come on..

493
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,960
Come. Just get in the car.

494
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:16,090
Get in the car.

495
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,300
'There's an old saying:'

496
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,920
'If you want to make God laugh,
then tell Him your plans.'

497
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,300
'But even before we could tell Him,
God was laughing perhaps..'

498
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,130
'..when we had just
thought about them.'

499
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,960
British Tourism's campaign
today should be perfect, okay?

500
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:47,590
- Rishma! - Our agency will also
get promotion along with them.

501
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,300
Rishma!

502
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,340
Yeah.

503
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,750
I'll call you back, okay?

504
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,460
Rishma!

505
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:53,630
Rajveer? What are you doing here?

506
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,380
Hi.

507
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,050
I need to discuss something
important with you.

508
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:59,130
And the topic of this
important discussion is Tasha?

509
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,550
How do you know?

510
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:04,960
Now if you keep following her 24/7,
like the mobile network's doggie..

511
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,300
Won't it become obvious?

512
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,800
So, you know.

513
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:11,090
Then you tell me, what should I do?

514
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:15,130
Look Rajveer, Tasha has an X factor..

515
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,380
..but she isn't like your Exs, okay?

516
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,210
She's a simple Indian girl.

517
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,880
And she needs a commitment.

518
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,800
But I don't think so you
are ready for a commitment.

519
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,840
Wait..
What makes you say that?

520
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,630
I am ready to make any
kind of a commitment. I love her.

521
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,090
Then tell her.

522
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,880
You mean..?

523
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:35,050
I propose that you go and propose.

524
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,750
See, today we are doing the campaign
shoot for the British Tourism.

525
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,380
And she's the face of the campaign.

526
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,210
I think today's a perfect
day for double celebration.

527
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:45,750
Do you think she'll say yes?

528
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:50,130
When the right guy proposes,
no girl rejects it.

529
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,210
Like I couldn't say no to Aryan.

530
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,090
He has eyes only for me.

531
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,380
It's not going come in to play,
there is no way.

532
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,960
What is your advice
to aspiring models?

533
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:05,050
If you think you are beautiful,
so will the world.

534
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,960
Britain once ruled India..

535
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:11,420
Today, you are now the
face of British Tourism.

536
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,710
As an Indian,
what have you got to say about this?

537
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,210
You just ruled our land.

538
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,300
As an Indian,
I am here to rule your hearts.

539
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,710
And you have started
that with my heart.

540
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,380
Last question.

541
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,340
What's your biggest dream in life?

542
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,130
I'm already living my biggest dream.

543
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,670
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you.

544
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,960
I too have a dream.

545
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,130
Will you fulfill it?

546
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,590
The dream you had
with your eyes open or..

547
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:51,130
..closed?

548
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,250
Both are the same.

549
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,380
When I open my eyes, I should see you.

550
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,840
And before I close my eyes,
I should see you.

551
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,420
I have a great news.

552
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,630
Rajveer is going to propose to Tasha.

553
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:13,750
What?

554
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:27,170
I have been in love with
you since the time I first saw you.

555
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,920
And from the time, I've been
in love with you, I see only you.

556
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:34,590
I love you, Tasha.

557
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:43,130
I love you too.

558
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,460
Rishma, I forgot to tell you.

559
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:09,880
You and Rajveer will have
to leave for Leeds tonight itself.

560
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,090
For Roy's meeting.

561
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,750
But wasn't that meeting
scheduled for next week?

562
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,800
It was, but he called
and rescheduled it.

563
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,090
I forgot to inform you.

564
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:18,960
Oh.

565
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:19,840
I would have gone..

566
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,550
..but I have to entertain
the officials along with Tasha..

567
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:24,050
At tonight's party.

568
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,170
Okay.

569
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:27,380
Work comes first.

570
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,800
Oh, I love you baby.

571
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,800
- Okay, come.
- Yes, come.

572
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,710
Mr. Roy, can we reschedule the next
week's meeting and have it tonight?

573
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:49,960
I won't be able to make it
but Rajveer and Rishma will be there.

574
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,210
Thank you.

575
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,840
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

576
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,300
I am so happy for both of you guys.

577
00:44:58,050 --> 00:44:59,210
Thank you so much.

578
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,550
I am sorry, Tasha.

579
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:03,590
Here I have you alone on
the very day I proposed to you.

580
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:06,210
It's okay. I can understand.

581
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,050
I'll see you.

582
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,050
Come on.

583
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,920
'I thought we will finally
get together tonight.'

584
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,630
'Never mind..'

585
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,300
'I'll wait another day for your love.'

586
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:25,710
- Hello Mr. Aryan.
- Hello Tasha.

587
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,840
- You looking beautiful.
- Thank you so much..

588
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,960
- Ah, pleasure to see you again.
- Hello Mr. Aryan.

589
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:33,460
- Hello sir.
- Hello Mr. Aryan.

590
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:35,050
- Tasha you looking stunning.
- Thanks.

591
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:36,050
Come.. come..

592
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:37,880
- Ah, Simond.
- Mr. Aryan.

593
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,300
Congratulations on
bagging this campaign.

594
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:41,880
And it is our pleasure..

595
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,210
..that such a beautiful lady will
be representing our British Heritage.

596
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:48,210
Thank you.
It's my pleasure, sir.

597
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:51,840
I must say, Aryan, the gorgeous
lady that is by your side..

598
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,670
..everyone else in the room
is burning up and dying of jealousy.

599
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,960
Now that is the hallmark
of a beautiful woman.

600
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,670
She always has men
ready to die for her.

601
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:01,630
Stop it.

602
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,590
You are making me blush.

603
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,500
Okay, I will stop.

604
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:08,250
You can make me do whatever you want.

605
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:18,750
Cheers.

606
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:29,500
Thank you.

607
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,800
"Lost in every drop.."

608
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,960
"This rainfall too is just like you."

609
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,630
"A unique experience."

610
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:29,500
"Something new and special."

611
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:34,340
"I blame the weather for this."

612
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,590
"Lost in every drop.."

613
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:44,880
"This rainfall too is just like you."

614
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,050
"Let's do whatever we please.."

615
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:00,880
"Let's make some mistakes."

616
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,630
"Such opportunities are few.."

617
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,130
"Such closeness is rare."

618
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:08,210
"Tell me, please.."

619
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,630
"Are you feeling lost too?"

620
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:19,670
"Does your heart too.."

621
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,800
"Desire something?"

622
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:31,750
"Lost in every drop.."

623
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,130
"This rainfall too is just like you."

624
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:39,710
"A unique experience."

625
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,550
"Something new and special."

626
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:47,210
"I blame the weather for this."

627
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,630
"Lost in every drop.."

628
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:58,250
"This rainfall too is just like you."

629
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,130
"Like you.."

630
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,090
"Don't look at anything but me."

631
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:11,340
"Filled with desire, both you and me."

632
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,590
"If you want to come close.."

633
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:19,960
"Then be my breath."

634
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,090
"There should be
nothing separate us.."

635
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:30,420
"Come close in such a way."

636
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:36,880
"Lost in every drop.."

637
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:42,300
"This rainfall too is just like you."

638
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:01,960
Tasha!

639
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,840
What have you done, Aryan?

640
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,500
Tasha, I wasn't in my senses.

641
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,800
I was sloshed.

642
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,460
You used me!

643
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:17,750
I did no such thing!

644
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:20,250
I swear, it was an accident.

645
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,630
What has happened will
break your brother's heart.

646
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,170
Rajveer and I, we love each other.

647
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:27,800
He proposed to me yesterday.

648
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:35,090
I am really sorry.

649
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,880
How will I look into his eyes?

650
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,880
How will I tell him that
I spent a night with his brother?

651
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
You don't need to tell him anything.

652
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,340
You want me to lie
and break his trust?

653
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,840
No, I want you to not to
break his heart by hiding the truth.

654
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:55,130
No one knows anything
other than the two of us.

655
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:56,960
It will be our little secret.

656
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:58,880
It's never a secret..

657
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,880
..when more than one person knows it.

658
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:03,170
Tasha..

659
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:06,130
I will not do anything
that would hurt you.

660
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,960
I have been in love with
you since the moment I saw you.

661
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:12,880
What are you saying, Aryan?

662
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:14,000
It is the truth.

663
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:16,460
I'm crazy about you.

664
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:19,630
But you are with Rishma.

665
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,340
Yes, I am with Rishma.

666
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,590
But since quite some time now,
in spite of being with each other..

667
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,250
..we are drifting apart.

668
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,460
It hurts a lot when
a relationship breaks.

669
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,550
But it hurts even
more when it shatters.

670
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,050
And right then..

671
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:48,960
You entered my life
to relieve me from the pain.

672
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,750
Now look, I am really-really
sorry for what happened.

673
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,710
I will set everything right.

674
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,750
You just handle your guilt, okay?

675
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,880
I'll protect your dignity.

676
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,050
I swear, trust me.

677
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,590
Good morning..
Hello, hello.

678
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:41,710
- Good morning..
- Good morning..

679
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:46,750
Well, I spent the last night
without you because of the assurance..

680
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,630
..that I will be spending
the rest of my life with you.

681
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:52,050
This morning is
questioning you and not me:

682
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,960
"Madam, where did
you spend the night?"

683
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,750
What happened? Everything's okay?

684
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:01,840
Well..

685
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:05,880
Rajveer, last night..

686
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:06,880
What happened, Tasha?

687
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,130
- Actually..
- You are scaring me.

688
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:12,130
Last night at the party..

689
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:13,670
What happened at the party?

690
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:16,880
Nothing.
I am not feeling well.

691
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I have a headache.

692
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:22,210
I got so excited about
your proposal that..

693
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,300
I had a little too many
drinks at the party last night.

694
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,000
I have a hangover. It's nothing.

695
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:32,130
I need to rest.

696
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:55,000
- Hi, darling.
- Hi.

697
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:56,590
- How was yesterday's meeting?
- Great.

698
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:59,750
- All set for today?
- Yes, all set.

699
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,590
So how was last night's party?

700
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:05,710
You know, same old, same old..
Nothing special.

701
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:09,130
Actually, I wanted to show
you the presentation pictures.

702
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:10,670
I am sure they are good.

703
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:13,300
Still. Have a look.

704
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,300
What is this?

705
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:32,090
How did you get these pictures?

706
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:34,960
Someone messaged me.

707
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,130
Look Rishma, it's not as it seems.

708
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:42,210
Okay!

709
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:45,170
You mean, this is not you?

710
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,670
And this isn't Tasha either?

711
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,000
We never got such
interesting pictures clicked.

712
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
But I am sure I can recognize you.

713
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:58,710
Look Rishma,
I had a little too much to drink.

714
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,880
- I..
- You know what, Aryan..

715
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,210
You are an a**hole.

716
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:08,550
You purposely send Rajveer
and me for the meeting last night.

717
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,800
So that you can have
a good time with Tasha.

718
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:14,380
That girl played a very good game.

719
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,630
First, she trapped
the younger brother.

720
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,090
Then the elder brother.

721
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,300
Hats off to her.

722
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:23,710
- Bloody b*t*h
- That's enough!

723
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,800
You can abuse me all you want,
but don't say a word against Tasha.

724
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:29,920
Damn!

725
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,800
To hell with you and
your company Aryan Khurana!

726
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:53,460
Yes, Tasha?

727
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:55,550
Aryan, where are you?
Come here right now.

728
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,840
What happened?

729
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,000
Don't waste time, damn it!
Get here now.

730
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:00,880
I am coming.

731
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,840
You have destroyed my life, Aryan.

732
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:15,590
Just give me some time.
I will set everything right.

733
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,750
So, I was right.

734
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:22,840
Leave the gun, Rishma!

735
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,170
What have you done, Aryan!

736
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,130
Tasha, we cannot change what happened.

737
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:38,210
But what happens
now is in our control.

738
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:51,670
Tasha..

739
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:11,960
Tasha..

740
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:13,920
Tasha..

741
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:15,670
Tasha, take care of yourself.

742
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,380
Don't do this, Aryan.
We can't do this to her.

743
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:22,130
Tasha, she is dead.

744
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:23,300
We are alive.

745
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,000
Think about that.

746
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:27,460
Just a few more steps.

747
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:29,630
After that,
we will get rid of this problem.

748
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:31,960
- Alright?
- Okay.

749
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,920
I have put so much weight on it
that her dead body will never surface.

750
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:03,710
Tasha..

751
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:06,300
Tasha, she is gone.

752
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,630
It's just the two of us now, okay?

753
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:10,840
Let's leave before anyone shows up.

754
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,840
Let's go.

755
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:16,960
Yes, it's just the two of us.

756
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:20,880
Aryan, what do you think..

757
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,960
This is a love story?

758
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:26,000
This isn't a love story..

759
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,000
It's a hate story.

760
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,380
The game has just begun.

761
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,670
There's a saying in my mother tongue

762
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:15,550
Shrouds come without pockets,
so the dead don't take bribes.

763
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,300
The dead don't take bribes..

764
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,380
- But you're alive..
- That we are.

765
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,380
Rajveer will bribe you to harass me.

766
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:25,380
And I will bribe
you to take his bribe.

767
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:27,920
Suits me. I get double.

768
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:30,750
You get double and he gets trouble!

769
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:35,380
Keep giving updates to
Monica about Rajveer and me.

770
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:38,300
Her love for Rajveer
will be my strength.

771
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:39,130
Okay.

772
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:40,420
She is damn hot.

773
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,750
I know.. I know..

774
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,750
Come in..

775
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:26,130
These photographs should change
the fate of the Khurana family.

776
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:34,090
After I am done dealing
with the Khuranas..

777
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:41,000
..not just they, but the whole world
shall always remember their fate.

778
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:52,250
Why aren't you shooting, Tasha?

779
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:58,050
Wherever I look,
I see Rishma's dead body.

780
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:00,590
Her dead eyes accuse me.

781
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:05,750
How can you remain normal after killing
someone and disposing off the body?

782
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,210
Stop this nonsense!

783
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:09,460
What do I do, Aryan?

784
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:11,420
I am scared!

785
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,210
Tasha, even I am scared.

786
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:15,710
But I am scared of your fear.

787
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:19,090
Look, everyone thinks she
has gone to a retreat for a week.

788
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:20,090
No one will have any doubts.

789
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:22,550
No one will mention her or
worry about her at least for a week.

790
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:24,420
And what happens after a week?

791
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:25,590
After a week..

792
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:28,300
After a week, I will file
a missing person's complaint.

793
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:30,130
No one will find her dead body.

794
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:32,090
The case will die and become cold.

795
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:33,590
And that blackmailer..

796
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:35,710
Who had sent us those photos?

797
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:39,300
A person's intention
displays his weakness.

798
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:44,550
As soon as he makes a demand, I will
know his intention and his weakness.

799
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:48,170
Then I'll find him
and I will deal with him.

800
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,460
Everything will be fine.

801
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,550
But don't do anything
to catch everyone's attention.

802
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:01,550
Okay?

803
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:02,710
What's happening here?

804
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:11,960
Nothing, Rajveer.

805
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:13,920
Tasha wasn't in a mood to shoot.

806
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,960
So, I was explaining to her..

807
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:18,300
That the client has
given us a deadline.

808
01:04:19,550 --> 01:04:21,210
But doesn't Rishma do all that?

809
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:23,550
Why are you doing it?

810
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:26,170
Where's Rishma?

811
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:28,420
She..

812
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:32,460
It's funny that Rishma
is still not here.

813
01:04:32,590 --> 01:04:35,250
As far as I know Rishma,
she lives and dies for her work.

814
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:37,880
Wait a second, let me just call her.

815
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,300
Rajveer, you know her..

816
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:44,420
When she wants a break,
not even work can stop her.

817
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,300
I got her message. She has
gone to the retreat for a few days.

818
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:49,590
She will be back.

819
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:02,590
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

820
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:08,300
Tasha..

821
01:05:08,590 --> 01:05:09,590
Tasha, enough is enough.

822
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:11,170
You avoided interacting
with me during the shoot.

823
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:12,300
You didn't even look into my eyes.

824
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:15,300
In the green room,
you were crying in Aryan's arms.

825
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,250
Ever since then I have
been asking you what is wrong..

826
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:18,380
..but you are not giving me a reply!

827
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:20,460
Just tell me what is wrong!
Just tell me!

828
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:23,170
Okay!

829
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,300
I will tell you!

830
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:25,670
Or better I will show you!

831
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:36,420
Look carefully, if you cannot
recognize her face then look carefully..

832
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:38,750
..I am sure you will
remember her body.

833
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,670
Suzanne, your ex-girlfriend.

834
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:43,050
She lasted for four weeks.

835
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,670
Anita, three months.

836
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:49,800
Rochelle, four months.

837
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:53,590
And Monica, she lasted the longest.

838
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:55,000
Six months.

839
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:00,920
And these are the black guys
whom you had bribed to harass me..

840
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:02,300
So that you could trap me.

841
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:03,960
You are not trying
to understand, Tasha..

842
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:06,750
Whoever has sent you these
photographs wants to separate us.

843
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,090
They want to break us up.

844
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:11,420
Only the things which
are intact can be broken.

845
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:17,590
Thank God, I know all these things
about you before we got together.

846
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,500
You think I cannot
give you a commitment?

847
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:27,550
Fine, now I'll show you how one gives
his heart and commitment to someone.

848
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:41,250
This relationship will only last
as long as your short life, Rajveer.

849
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:58,880
I will kill you if you
try to separate Tasha and me.

850
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:15,590
This is the first
time a UK based Indian..

851
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:17,670
..is on the verge
of becoming the mayor.

852
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,710
All polls show that his
win is now a foregone conclusion!

853
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,090
How do you feel, sir?

854
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:23,420
Overwhelmed.

855
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,210
Humbled.

856
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:29,710
As the exit polls indicate
my victory is certain..

857
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:32,090
..all I can say is,
I am very touched..

858
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:35,170
..by the love given
to me by people of England.

859
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,920
And for people back home:

860
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:42,090
When I came to England
a long time ago..

861
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:49,550
..I had never thought I'd get
such love, respect and status here.

862
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,800
And to people of England,
all I can say is:

863
01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:54,300
Your magnanimity..

864
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,000
Your graciousness..

865
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,090
- Hello Aryan.
- How are you?

866
01:08:04,210 --> 01:08:05,250
Good to see you.

867
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:23,960
Tasha..

868
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,090
I cannot find Rajveer.

869
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:30,460
After what happened yesterday,
I am not surprised.

870
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:32,340
Why?

871
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:34,380
What happened between
the two of you yesterday?

872
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:38,300
Only a discussion that nothing
can happen between us now.

873
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,420
Why did you need to tell him that?

874
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:44,590
So, what should I have told him?

875
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:47,550
Come, let's be together.

876
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:50,420
So what if I have slept
with your elder brother?

877
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,750
Draupadi was a common
consort of the five Pandavas.

878
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:56,050
There are just two brothers here.

879
01:08:57,130 --> 01:08:57,960
You..

880
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:00,210
Oh God, who is calling me?

881
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,250
- Damn.
- What happened?

882
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:09,380
Come with me.

883
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:17,090
What happened, Aryan?
What's wrong with you?

884
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:19,630
Look at this!

885
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,050
Oh my god.

886
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,210
What will we do now?

887
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:39,920
We are surely going to be arrested!

888
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:42,090
If someone wanted us to get arrested..

889
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:44,380
..we would have been
behind bars by now.

890
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:46,920
The blackmailer who sent
this clip is the same blackmailer..

891
01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:48,750
..who had sent those photographs.

892
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,710
He doesn't want to get us arrested.

893
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:53,550
He wants something else.

894
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:57,090
We have to be very very careful.

895
01:09:57,630 --> 01:10:01,460
And come what may,
nothing should hamper dad's campaign.

896
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,710
Aryan, we had forgotten
that there is no perfect crime!

897
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,300
Ladies and gentleman.

898
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:10,130
Good evening, everyone.

899
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:12,960
- Good evening hello, hi, how are you.
- This is Rajveer.

900
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:15,500
Attention please.

901
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:17,550
Hello.

902
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:19,250
Hi!

903
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:23,050
My name is Rajveer Khurana.

904
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,750
Before I say anything dad..

905
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I just want to thank you.
And I just want tell you..

906
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:34,460
..how lucky I am to be your son.

907
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,000
And how proud I am.

908
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:41,250
And I know dad,
that I have not been a good son.

909
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:42,420
I am sorry.

910
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:44,300
But I wanna confess..

911
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:46,840
In front of you,
in front of this whole world..

912
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,800
- No, bro..I won't stop.
- Rajveer.

913
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:52,710
So please don't try to stop me either.

914
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:00,420
Sorry.. I am sorry,
ladies and gentlemen..

915
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:05,750
As I was saying, if a girl
has more than one relationship..

916
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:08,380
..then she is labeled
as a characterless woman.

917
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:15,170
And if a boy has relationship
with more than one girl..

918
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:17,300
..then he is praised.

919
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:19,710
They call him a player, dad.

920
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:22,250
But I don't get it.

921
01:11:23,210 --> 01:11:24,250
I don't get this.

922
01:11:25,170 --> 01:11:31,550
A boy who plays with someone's heart,
her body, her emotions..

923
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:35,960
How can he be a player?

924
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,000
He is an animal, isn't it..?

925
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:40,380
Just like me.

926
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,500
But I am a changed man, dad.

927
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:52,880
And..

928
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:56,090
And the girl who has changed me..

929
01:11:56,590 --> 01:12:00,380
Who made me realize that
the union of two bodies is not..

930
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:05,250
..as important as
the union of two hearts.

931
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:13,000
And dad, that girl is Tasha.

932
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:22,960
I love you, Tasha.

933
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:25,130
I love you.

934
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:33,750
"I have devoted all the
moments of my life to you."

935
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:39,550
"I have devoted all the
moments of my life to you."

936
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:44,880
"I got myself a bad name for you."

937
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:50,800
"The more defamed I got,
the lonelier I became."

938
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:57,420
"The more defamed I got,
the lonelier I became."

939
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:15,050
"I always keep thinking about you."

940
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:20,960
"I always keep dreaming about you."

941
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:26,800
"I know that you changed your path.."

942
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:32,420
"But my poor hearts
still dwells in the past."

943
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:38,590
"I also dedicated
my last breath to you."

944
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:44,170
"I also dedicated
my last breath to you."

945
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:49,500
"I rendered myself useless for you."

946
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:55,170
"The more defamed I got,
the lonelier I became."

947
01:14:55,460 --> 01:15:01,250
"The more defamed I got,
the lonelier I became."

948
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:31,460
"I see myself in your eyes."

949
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:42,250
"I see myself in your eyes."

950
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:49,000
"Tell me, what do you see in mine?"

951
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:54,630
"I turned day into night
just admiring and loving you."

952
01:15:55,090 --> 01:16:00,800
"I turned day into night
just admiring and loving you."

953
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:05,880
"I sacrificed myself for you."

954
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:11,420
"The more defamed I got,
the lonelier I became."

955
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:18,000
"The more defamed I got,
the lonelier I became."

956
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:24,250
"I have devoted all the
moments of my life to you."

957
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:29,750
"I have devoted all the
moments of my life to you."

958
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:35,250
"I got myself a bad name for you."

959
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:40,710
"The more defamed I got,
the lonelier I became."

960
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:48,000
"The more defamed I got,
the lonelier I became."

961
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:27,500
Tasha!

962
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:30,710
You shouldn't have created
a scene there, Rajveer.

963
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:33,050
You have jeopardized
your dad's campaign.

964
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:34,380
To hell with his campaign, Tasha.

965
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:35,880
You matter to me.

966
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,550
We matter, Tasha.

967
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:39,750
Rajveer, why don't you understand..

968
01:17:40,090 --> 01:17:41,420
We can never be together.

969
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:43,050
Why can't we be together?

970
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:45,460
Because at a time, there
can be just one man in my life..

971
01:17:45,550 --> 01:17:46,500
And not two!

972
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:49,090
What do you mean?

973
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:51,750
There is someone else
in my life, Rajveer.

974
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,380
And here I thought
that you were decent.

975
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:01,840
But I was so wrong.

976
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:04,550
You're such a sl*t.

977
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:07,000
Who's that son of b*t*h
who came between us!

978
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:08,090
What is his name!

979
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,590
You really wanna know who he is?

980
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:12,170
Then I'll tell you.

981
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:14,380
- That son of b*t*h..
- Rajveer!

982
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:16,840
What the hell are you doing?

983
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:21,880
I have tasted blood, bro.

984
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,920
Now I am a scoundrel
as well as a monster.

985
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:29,500
Come what may, Tasha will be mine.

986
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:32,920
Anyone who comes between
us will die such a horrific death..

987
01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:35,750
..by my hands that even his own family
won't be able to recognize his dead body!

988
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,420
You are not in your senses.

989
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,090
Just go home. Now!

990
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:44,420
Congratulations.

991
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:48,710
Today you did what
no one could ever do.

992
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,210
You took my heart from me..

993
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:55,590
And then you broke it.

994
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:08,960
What the hell were
you going to tell him?

995
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:11,340
I was about to tell him about us.

996
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,300
I can't be with him, Aryan.

997
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:18,460
If there is anyone I can
spend my life with then it's you.

998
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:19,500
Only you.

999
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,420
- What?
- Yes, Aryan.

1000
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:27,250
I have started to realize
that I only keep thinking about you.

1001
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:29,460
We should tell Rajveer the truth..

1002
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:32,210
That we are together.

1003
01:19:34,590 --> 01:19:37,300
Tasha, we don't have
time for all this.

1004
01:19:37,670 --> 01:19:40,800
Blackmailer has a video
clip of Rishma's murder. He..

1005
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:47,710
I love you, Aryan..

1006
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:50,170
I love you so much.

1007
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:54,090
I can't live without you..

1008
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:02,340
'There are many who backstab
others while pretending to be close.'

1009
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:04,840
'But I'll slab your
back in such a way..'

1010
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:09,340
'..that it'd come
out piercing your heart.'

1011
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:18,300
Rajveer!

1012
01:20:18,710 --> 01:20:20,210
Where the hell is Rajveer!

1013
01:20:21,130 --> 01:20:22,300
Dad, what happened?
What is wrong?

1014
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:23,710
Where is Rajveer?

1015
01:20:24,670 --> 01:20:25,500
And you..

1016
01:20:26,090 --> 01:20:27,800
Don't you get it?

1017
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:30,090
You don't understand!
You don't get it!

1018
01:20:30,210 --> 01:20:31,710
I asked you to keep
him away from that girl..

1019
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,090
..till the mayoral
elections don't end!

1020
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:36,210
You cannot handle a girl!

1021
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:38,300
Just calm down, dad.
I'll handle everything.

1022
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:39,550
Calm down?

1023
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,050
What did you say?

1024
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:43,710
Calm down!

1025
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,000
I am sorry, son.

1026
01:20:51,170 --> 01:20:52,250
I was mistaken.

1027
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:56,550
You have handled that girl so well.

1028
01:21:04,090 --> 01:21:08,090
I had asked you to make sure
your brother keeps his pants up.

1029
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:12,880
But that didn't mean I gave
you the permission to drop your pants.

1030
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:14,420
Dad, it was a mistake.

1031
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:16,670
It all happened in a drunken stupor.

1032
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:20,340
You got drunk and I am
suffering from its hangover.

1033
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:22,300
Interesting.

1034
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:24,750
Very interesting.

1035
01:21:25,670 --> 01:21:28,550
My younger son wants
to marry a girl..

1036
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:33,460
..that my eldest son
slept with before marriage.

1037
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:36,000
Interesting.

1038
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:41,210
Does Rishma know about this?

1039
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:44,670
Yes.

1040
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,000
And she let you live?

1041
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:57,300
Because you killed
her before she could.

1042
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:01,880
Dad..

1043
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,460
Look, someone is
trying to blackmail us.

1044
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:12,960
If these photographs
and video clip leak..

1045
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:15,340
..then your death
won't be an accident.

1046
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,460
You'll be hanged by law!

1047
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:22,250
I will only lose the elections,
but you..

1048
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:28,920
Who is this blackmailer?

1049
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:31,460
What does he want?

1050
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:35,090
I don't know, dad.

1051
01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:38,000
He has so far made no demands.

1052
01:22:40,550 --> 01:22:41,960
He hasn't made any demands?

1053
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,000
But he keeps on sending messages.

1054
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:46,960
Check what it is.

1055
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:49,750
I cannot tolerate
these beeps any more.

1056
01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:57,300
Mr. Khurana,
I am sure by now you know that..

1057
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:59,550
..I am not playing some childish game.

1058
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:03,880
Tell both your sons to confess
the crime they committed..

1059
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:07,710
..two years ago in
India on this very day.

1060
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:17,090
Otherwise, I will handover these
pics and clips to the local police.

1061
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:22,340
And soon as these get downloaded,
your sons will get uploaded.

1062
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:24,800
Two years ago.

1063
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:28,550
That means..

1064
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:29,840
Ashwin Chaudhary.

1065
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:35,550
So let's go to other club.

1066
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:37,420
- I love this place.
- Guys, I am so tired!

1067
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:40,630
- I want to go home.
- Listen, so what if one club is closed?

1068
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:42,800
- Other clubs are still open.
- Yes.

1069
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:45,300
- Someone please reason it with him.
- No, exactly, Bhavna.

1070
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:46,630
You should come with us.

1071
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:48,500
And what will I do
with the two of you?

1072
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:49,460
Enjoy?

1073
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:52,380
I'll enjoy tomorrow.
I'm very tired.

1074
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:53,500
Bye.

1075
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:55,550
I have to go, I have to go.
I am very tired.

1076
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:57,170
- Bye bye bye..
- Okay bye.

1077
01:23:57,590 --> 01:23:58,960
- See you tomorrow.
- We'll miss you.

1078
01:23:59,130 --> 01:24:00,000
- Bye!
- Miss you too.

1079
01:24:00,090 --> 01:24:01,170
- Come.
- Let's go.

1080
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,090
You are too hot to go home alone.

1081
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,960
Shall I drop you home?

1082
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:30,340
No, thank you.

1083
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,670
Thank me after you
start having fun, baby.

1084
01:24:34,130 --> 01:24:35,380
Just get lost, okay?

1085
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:36,380
Really.

1086
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:38,920
Let go!

1087
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,960
This is what people
have stopped being nice.

1088
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:43,460
Because in the end its
being rogue that always works.

1089
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:44,340
Let me go!

1090
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:46,500
I still haven't even
held you properly.

1091
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:49,550
I am somebody who can get anybody.

1092
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,380
But I want nobody
other than your body.

1093
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:01,420
Let go of me!

1094
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:03,000
- Let go of me!
- Come.

1095
01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:04,550
No, leave me!

1096
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:06,750
- Hey!
- What?

1097
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,460
- What's happening?
- Please help me.

1098
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:10,340
- Let go of her hand.
- I won't. What will you do?

1099
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,090
Let go of her hand.

1100
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:13,840
Don't worry about it, okay?
I'll handle this.

1101
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:15,750
Hey, don't interfere, otherwise..

1102
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,800
I wouldn't have interfered if I were
going to get scared of your otherwise..

1103
01:25:19,170 --> 01:25:20,050
Understand?

1104
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:21,420
Don't worry.

1105
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:22,630
She is your sister?

1106
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:25,380
No!

1107
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:27,550
But she must be someone's sister.

1108
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:25,250
No, no, no!
No please!

1109
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:42,300
Rajveer, get in the car!

1110
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,500
Rajveer, I said get in the car.

1111
01:26:57,590 --> 01:26:59,670
You should have thought
twice before using the gun.

1112
01:27:01,170 --> 01:27:04,050
Guns don't require safety,
but your mind does.

1113
01:27:05,050 --> 01:27:07,460
How many times have I told
you to keep your brother in control!

1114
01:27:08,130 --> 01:27:09,880
Okay, were there any witnesses?

1115
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,420
There was a girl.

1116
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:15,420
Look dad,
we cannot change what happened.

1117
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:17,460
Now please tell us what we should do.

1118
01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:18,550
Get out of India.

1119
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:20,750
Come back to England immediately.

1120
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,340
I will handle the rest.

1121
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,090
Ashwin!

1122
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,550
Thank God,
you regained consciousness, dear.

1123
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:01,710
Your dad and I were so worried.

1124
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:02,840
Okay.

1125
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,090
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

1126
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:11,210
Mr. Shrivastava..

1127
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:12,460
Yes, speaking.

1128
01:29:12,590 --> 01:29:16,210
Please pay attention
to what I am about to say.

1129
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:17,630
Who are you?

1130
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:20,210
Forget that.
Don't bother about it.

1131
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:24,050
Your daughter Bhavna
who is in the hospital..

1132
01:29:24,130 --> 01:29:26,920
..don't try to find the reason.

1133
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:34,840
The cop standing behind you..

1134
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:38,840
..has already received
his bonus this month.

1135
01:29:39,710 --> 01:29:41,710
The rest is up to you.

1136
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,420
So madam, you mean to say that
there were no street lights there..

1137
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:52,050
..and hence there
was a lot of darkness.

1138
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:54,960
And that's why you couldn't
take a good look at those two boys.

1139
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:56,960
This is what you want to
say in your testimony, right?

1140
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:59,170
I have given no such statement, right?

1141
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,710
You are right, inspector.

1142
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:04,710
Bhavna didn't see them.

1143
01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:07,380
- Papa, I saw..
- You didn't see anything.

1144
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,090
- But..
- Please?

1145
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:10,880
Try to understand.

1146
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:20,710
Inspector,
it happened just as you said.

1147
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:22,090
Good.

1148
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:02,750
Madam!

1149
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:06,590
Why are you wasting
your time as well as mine?

1150
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,170
- How many times have I told you..
- That girl is lying.

1151
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:13,090
That girl didn't even see
the faces of those two boys.

1152
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:16,380
How can we file a
case against just anyone? Right?

1153
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:18,420
You are right.

1154
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:21,750
What can you do?

1155
01:31:23,050 --> 01:31:26,840
Now whatever needs to be done,
will be done by me.

1156
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,460
Do it, do it on your own.

1157
01:31:30,130 --> 01:31:31,590
But let me tell you something.

1158
01:31:32,710 --> 01:31:36,710
I cannot get you justice
without that girl's testimony.

1159
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,050
Go, okay.

1160
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:50,500
Bhavna..

1161
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,500
If you don't tell me
the truth then no brother..

1162
01:31:55,590 --> 01:32:01,170
..will never consider an unknown girl
as his sister and risk his life for her.

1163
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:05,170
My brother has given you a new world.

1164
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:07,250
A new life.

1165
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:12,000
And you are supporting
those who killed my brother?

1166
01:32:13,670 --> 01:32:16,500
I too have a right to
know who killed my brother.

1167
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:20,210
My daughter has already
spoken to the cops.

1168
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:23,090
You should leave, please.

1169
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,710
Bhavna, please? Bhavna?
Bhavna, please tell me.

1170
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:29,170
- Bhavna, please?
- I said you should leave, please.

1171
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:30,420
Bhavna..

1172
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:06,920
Madam, there's a parcel for you.

1173
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:23,300
'I was a coward hence
I lied to the cops.'

1174
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:26,420
'They have bribed the
system and the police.'

1175
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,800
'No one can do them any harm.'

1176
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:30,710
'Except for a sister.'

1177
01:33:31,420 --> 01:33:34,800
'She is neither scared of the
system nor does she need the police.'

1178
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,300
'The names of the boys
who brutally killed Ashwin are..'

1179
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:41,000
'Aryan and Rajveer Khurana.'

1180
01:34:09,340 --> 01:34:13,380
Someone from Ashwin Chaudhary's
family is targeting us.

1181
01:34:15,130 --> 01:34:16,800
Find out who it is.

1182
01:34:18,170 --> 01:34:21,670
That person doesn't know
how powerful Khuranas are.

1183
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:24,840
And listen..

1184
01:34:28,090 --> 01:34:31,550
Don't be an ideal brother and confess
everything to your younger brother.

1185
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:38,170
If the devil in him rises then his
stupidity will ruin everything for us.

1186
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:43,460
Does he know everything
about you and Tasha?

1187
01:34:44,170 --> 01:34:46,090
No. He doesn't know.

1188
01:35:05,670 --> 01:35:10,500
"Love has given me.."

1189
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:16,170
"A never-ending ache."

1190
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:21,500
"The sky reflecting.."

1191
01:35:21,670 --> 01:35:26,300
"In my eyes, too, is wet."

1192
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,960
"I had never imagined.."

1193
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:36,380
"Whatever that happened."

1194
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:42,420
"Love makes you crave."

1195
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:48,170
"What kind of a punishment is this?"

1196
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:59,170
"Heartache too gives you
a strange kind of pleasure."

1197
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:13,960
"My complaints.."

1198
01:36:14,090 --> 01:36:16,880
"Are expressed in my eyes."

1199
01:36:17,090 --> 01:36:22,550
"I object to your callousness."

1200
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:29,920
"My complaints.."

1201
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:32,920
"Are expressed in my eyes."

1202
01:36:33,090 --> 01:36:37,960
"I object to your callousness."

1203
01:36:38,050 --> 01:36:40,590
"If you get upset.."

1204
01:36:40,710 --> 01:36:43,550
"If that happens.."

1205
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:48,250
"My heartbeat disapproves..
My heart refutes."

1206
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:53,460
"Without you, for me.."

1207
01:36:53,590 --> 01:36:59,500
"Love is full of forlornness."

1208
01:37:00,210 --> 01:37:05,550
"Love makes you crave."

1209
01:37:05,710 --> 01:37:10,670
"What kind of a punishment is this?"

1210
01:37:11,090 --> 01:37:22,380
"Heartache too gives you
a strange kind of pleasure."

1211
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:23,750
- Hello?
- Hello.

1212
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:24,840
Who is that?

1213
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:29,960
Wouldn't you like to know who replaced
you in Tasha's heart and bed?

1214
01:37:37,050 --> 01:37:38,130
Who's that?

1215
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,340
After your stint of being a hero..

1216
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:48,880
..I had decided that I
wouldn't spare either of you.

1217
01:37:49,090 --> 01:37:51,090
And then I started keeping
an eye on both of you.

1218
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:55,300
And imagine my joy when I hit jackpot!

1219
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:59,250
Just tell me the name of the
person who stole my Tasha from me.

1220
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:01,590
Let me take that first.

1221
01:38:24,210 --> 01:38:28,170
Two brothers,
one better than the other.

1222
01:38:28,710 --> 01:38:30,050
What a great family you have!

1223
01:38:30,380 --> 01:38:32,130
Just like the movie
'Hum Saath Saath Hai' type!

1224
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:37,500
The family that eats together,
lives together, sleeps together!

1225
01:38:42,210 --> 01:38:44,590
You cheated me with my own brother!

1226
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Yes!

1227
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:49,000
With the same brother who told me..

1228
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:52,090
..he had fallen in love with
me the moment he saw my photograph!

1229
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:55,550
With the same brother who showed me the
photographs of all your ex-girlfriends!

1230
01:38:55,840 --> 01:39:01,630
Who told me how you bribed those ruffians
to harass me so that you can have me!

1231
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,750
I was just a toy for you.

1232
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:09,090
You wanted to have a little fun,
play with me.

1233
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:11,880
If Aryan hadn't stopped
you on the day of the launch..

1234
01:39:12,210 --> 01:39:14,210
..then you would have spiked my drink!

1235
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:16,300
This is your true love?

1236
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:19,300
That b**tard!

1237
01:39:20,090 --> 01:39:22,710
He instigated you against
me so that he can have me, Tasha!

1238
01:39:24,130 --> 01:39:27,420
Rajveer, I had really started
to fall in love with you.

1239
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:33,170
But Aryan made me realize
that I had always loved you..

1240
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:36,170
..but you were always
after only my body.

1241
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:39,340
He told you all my attributes.

1242
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:40,920
But perhaps he forgot to mention his.

1243
01:39:41,210 --> 01:39:42,800
Didn't he use Rishma?

1244
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,170
He pretended to be in love
with her and manipulated her.

1245
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:47,460
You know what?

1246
01:39:47,630 --> 01:39:49,210
Let Rishma get back from the retreat.

1247
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:50,800
Rishma knows everything.

1248
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:52,800
What?

1249
01:39:55,460 --> 01:39:57,380
You mean Rishma knows about you two?

1250
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,130
Whatever you need to ask..

1251
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:02,460
Go and ask Aryan.

1252
01:40:05,130 --> 01:40:07,090
I will surely ask Aryan..

1253
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:10,000
But you should start talking
now or else I will kill you!

1254
01:40:11,170 --> 01:40:13,420
Rishma is dead..

1255
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:22,630
Rishma is dead.

1256
01:40:34,090 --> 01:40:35,090
Aryan..

1257
01:40:37,090 --> 01:40:41,460
You will have to
pay.. for your betrayals.

1258
01:40:56,420 --> 01:40:58,670
When the younger one will
go to kill his elder brother..

1259
01:40:59,250 --> 01:41:02,840
.. it won't be an epic
of love but an epic of war!

1260
01:41:03,590 --> 01:41:04,880
So make sure we file the papers today.

1261
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:06,300
Excuse me.

1262
01:41:07,710 --> 01:41:08,250
Hello?

1263
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:11,340
Aryan, Rajveer knows everything.

1264
01:41:11,710 --> 01:41:13,670
The blackmailer has
given him all the evidences.

1265
01:41:13,750 --> 01:41:14,750
He's gone mad.

1266
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:21,300
He kept repeating that he'd kill you.

1267
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:23,130
I am so scared, Aryan!

1268
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:24,750
He is coming to get you.

1269
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:32,920
And the Oscar goes to..

1270
01:41:54,050 --> 01:41:54,880
Rajveer..

1271
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:57,920
Rajveer, I..

1272
01:42:09,210 --> 01:42:10,380
This is the place..

1273
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:13,750
This is the place where I
brought Tasha for the first time..

1274
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,840
To fulfill her dreams.

1275
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:19,960
And today..

1276
01:42:20,670 --> 01:42:25,170
Today, the same place holds
nothing but my broken dreams.

1277
01:42:26,630 --> 01:42:29,000
You know what hurts me
more than my shattered dreams?

1278
01:42:30,170 --> 01:42:32,090
The fact that someone
close shattered them!

1279
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:35,170
My own brother.

1280
01:42:39,130 --> 01:42:40,130
Look Rajveer..

1281
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:42,800
I can explain everything.

1282
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,710
A girl shouldn't come between us.

1283
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:47,340
Which girl are you talking about?

1284
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:50,750
Oh, you mean, Rishma!

1285
01:42:52,590 --> 01:42:55,050
You killed her because she
came between you and Tasha, right?

1286
01:42:57,710 --> 01:42:58,670
No!

1287
01:42:59,210 --> 01:43:01,880
Whatever that happened with Rishma..
That was an accident!

1288
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:08,920
Really?

1289
01:43:10,090 --> 01:43:12,960
Just like Ashwin's
death was an accident?

1290
01:43:13,050 --> 01:43:14,050
Right?

1291
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:16,300
The bullets got fired
from the gun on their own.

1292
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:20,670
Your hands begged to
the trigger to use it, right?

1293
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:21,840
What nonsense!

1294
01:43:22,090 --> 01:43:24,920
You very well know that
I killed Ashwin so that you live.

1295
01:43:25,130 --> 01:43:27,460
I shed his blood so that
I could save my flesh and blood.

1296
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:30,960
Ever since childhood, I have
given you whatever you asked for.

1297
01:43:31,130 --> 01:43:33,090
I have valued your
happiness more than mine!

1298
01:43:33,170 --> 01:43:35,210
So you are using this
excuse to settle the score?

1299
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:37,300
Or are you tired of pretending
to be a great elder brother?

1300
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:38,670
- Rajveer!
- Enough!

1301
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:42,050
If you had asked,
I would have even given you my life!

1302
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:44,630
But you didn't ask..
you just snatched it away!

1303
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:48,420
Rajveer, you very well know
that I am ready to even die for you!

1304
01:43:48,670 --> 01:43:49,960
Are you ready to tell the truth?

1305
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:52,750
Then let's do one thing.
Let's go to the cops and confess.

1306
01:43:53,090 --> 01:43:56,090
We will tell them that
we both killed Ashwin in Mumbai..

1307
01:43:56,210 --> 01:43:58,550
..and here,
in London, you killed Rishma.

1308
01:43:58,840 --> 01:43:59,840
Okay? Let's go!

1309
01:44:00,210 --> 01:44:01,050
Rajveer!

1310
01:44:01,750 --> 01:44:02,960
Have you lost your mind?

1311
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:04,800
We will lose everything if we do that!

1312
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:07,840
I have nothing left
to lose after I lost Tasha!

1313
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:10,630
The truth is that you don't
want to confess and lose her!

1314
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,800
Anger and stubbornness
has blinded you.

1315
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:15,130
Not blind, I am ruined in love!

1316
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:17,130
And now it's your turn to get ruined.

1317
01:44:17,340 --> 01:44:18,630
I am going to the cops.

1318
01:44:19,090 --> 01:44:20,630
Rajveer! You cannot!

1319
01:44:20,750 --> 01:44:22,420
Let me see who will stop me.

1320
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:23,840
Rajveer!

1321
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:25,800
Let go, Aryan!

1322
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:07,880
Rajveer, don't force me.

1323
01:45:36,130 --> 01:45:37,800
She was my life!

1324
01:45:38,210 --> 01:45:39,840
She was my life!

1325
01:47:20,090 --> 01:47:21,090
No! No! No!

1326
01:47:22,170 --> 01:47:23,170
Rajveer..!

1327
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:24,590
Rajveer..!

1328
01:47:25,210 --> 01:47:26,210
Rajveer..?

1329
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:27,340
Get up, Rajveer!

1330
01:47:29,630 --> 01:47:30,710
Rajveer..!

1331
01:47:39,170 --> 01:47:41,000
Get up, Rajveer! Get up!

1332
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:51,340
I killed him, Tasha..

1333
01:47:52,090 --> 01:47:53,670
I killed my own brother.

1334
01:47:54,590 --> 01:47:56,130
- It was an accident.
- No!

1335
01:47:56,340 --> 01:47:57,170
Rajveer!

1336
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:00,130
Rajveer..

1337
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:06,630
What should we do?

1338
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:08,960
What should we do now?

1339
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:10,710
Dad.. should we call dad?

1340
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,840
Listen, no.

1341
01:48:13,170 --> 01:48:17,250
No one should find out
what happened here, okay?

1342
01:48:35,170 --> 01:48:39,210
'It's said that we
are just a clay puppet..'

1343
01:48:39,630 --> 01:48:41,340
'Made by God.'

1344
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:47,090
'But your sister made him bite
dust and sent him to God, Ashwin.'

1345
01:48:47,710 --> 01:48:49,050
'One down..'

1346
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:51,050
'One to go.'

1347
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:00,420
I don't know when he left.
I was with the client..

1348
01:49:00,590 --> 01:49:04,300
Officer my son Rajveer has been
missing for the last two days.

1349
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:08,250
You know he left right
after my nomination party.

1350
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:12,250
We've.. tried everywhere,
his cell's off..

1351
01:49:13,210 --> 01:49:15,170
He has never done
anything like this before.

1352
01:49:15,670 --> 01:49:17,340
Mr. Khurana,
we'll make sure the information..

1353
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:19,420
..gets to all relevant authorities.

1354
01:49:19,630 --> 01:49:21,340
Don't worry. We'll track him down.

1355
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:22,710
Really appreciate it.

1356
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:27,800
I am worried about Rajveer.

1357
01:49:29,630 --> 01:49:30,590
Don't worry, dad.

1358
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:32,630
We will find him.

1359
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:44,920
Hi, Ron.

1360
01:49:46,710 --> 01:49:47,710
How have you been?

1361
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:01,210
Dude, that girl has become a star..

1362
01:50:03,460 --> 01:50:04,300
Which girl?

1363
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:05,800
What do you mean which girl?

1364
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:08,460
The one that was so desperate
to get my place at the club..

1365
01:50:08,590 --> 01:50:11,460
..that she paid for me
to go on a year long vacation?

1366
01:50:14,090 --> 01:50:15,090
- Alia?
- Yeah.

1367
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:16,920
I have a deal for you.

1368
01:50:17,300 --> 01:50:18,050
Deal?

1369
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,590
I don't know what
you are talking about.

1370
01:50:22,250 --> 01:50:23,920
Are you talking about
this girl, right?

1371
01:50:25,170 --> 01:50:27,250
Yeah! Tasha!
Show Ron as well.

1372
01:50:27,670 --> 01:50:29,460
The star maker seems
to have forgotten the girl..

1373
01:50:29,590 --> 01:50:31,340
..that he helped become a star.

1374
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:41,710
This is a once in a lifetime offer!

1375
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:46,420
For the next one year, you don't have
to show anyone your face or your body!

1376
01:50:48,630 --> 01:50:51,590
Thanks.
Looks like destiny is smiling on me.

1377
01:50:52,090 --> 01:50:53,090
Yes, it is.

1378
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:55,960
And destiny's name is Tasha.

1379
01:50:59,340 --> 01:51:01,210
Bro, she is hot!

1380
01:51:04,750 --> 01:51:08,630
I know, I am very much sure that
she is gonna burn the dance floor.

1381
01:51:09,210 --> 01:51:11,590
Yes, she's out to burn the world!

1382
01:51:17,090 --> 01:51:18,340
We have the recent photograph..

1383
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:20,880
- ..then I just forward to you.
- Yes, we got it. Don't worry.

1384
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,960
We will circulate it
all around the authority..

1385
01:51:23,050 --> 01:51:23,880
Thank you, officer.

1386
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:26,420
- Aryan?
- Listen, it's a bad time.

1387
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:29,880
I don't have time if you've called
to cry about Rajveer's shenanigans.

1388
01:51:30,630 --> 01:51:32,000
Aryan, listen to me.

1389
01:51:32,130 --> 01:51:35,130
I tried calling Rajveer
but his cell is switched off.

1390
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:36,590
That's why I am calling you.

1391
01:51:36,710 --> 01:51:38,920
I didn't call to talk about myself.

1392
01:51:39,090 --> 01:51:41,590
I called to tell you
something about Tasha.

1393
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:42,750
Tasha?

1394
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:45,340
What do you want
to tell me about Tasha?

1395
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:27,500
What are you doing here?

1396
01:52:47,420 --> 01:52:49,670
Tasha, you have been
a great support to me.

1397
01:52:50,130 --> 01:52:52,130
And everything will soon be fine now.

1398
01:52:53,340 --> 01:52:55,130
So I want to gift you a story.

1399
01:52:55,750 --> 01:52:56,800
A story?

1400
01:52:57,130 --> 01:53:02,920
But you'll have to close your eyes,
to hear and feel it.

1401
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:11,920
Once upon a time,
in a kingdom far far away..

1402
01:53:12,130 --> 01:53:15,000
There was a king who had two sons.

1403
01:53:15,670 --> 01:53:18,800
They were the princes of that kingdom.

1404
01:53:19,590 --> 01:53:23,420
The elder brother loved
his younger sibling.

1405
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:28,750
He was ready to do anything
to fulfill all his whims and fancies.

1406
01:53:29,090 --> 01:53:32,590
He was the apple of his eyes.

1407
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:38,420
One day,
both the brothers went to India.

1408
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:42,880
And there they met a boy..

1409
01:53:43,590 --> 01:53:47,250
..whose parents had given
him tad too many good values.

1410
01:53:48,090 --> 01:53:49,960
And because of those good values..

1411
01:53:50,090 --> 01:53:53,250
..that poor guy lost
his life too early.

1412
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:58,880
That boy's name was
Late Ashwin Chaudhary.

1413
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,210
And you turned out to be his sister.

1414
01:54:06,050 --> 01:54:12,710
Soon to be Late Natasha Chaudhary,
a.k.a. Tasha!

1415
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:22,210
You cheater.

1416
01:54:22,420 --> 01:54:24,670
If I don't send you
to your brother then..

1417
01:54:28,590 --> 01:54:32,420
I don't know whether I
should applaud you or pity you..

1418
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:35,170
..for this incomplete story of yours.

1419
01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:36,920
Okay!

1420
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:38,340
I will do one thing!

1421
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:44,210
Let me tell you a story
to complete this incomplete story.

1422
01:54:45,090 --> 01:54:49,750
And listen, you don't need
to close your eyes to feel my story.

1423
01:54:50,590 --> 01:54:52,130
Keep your eyes open and hear it.

1424
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:56,420
Because I am going to really
enjoy narrating this story.

1425
01:54:58,210 --> 01:55:00,670
So this is a story of a sister..

1426
01:55:01,630 --> 01:55:03,340
Who had made herself a promise..

1427
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:06,630
..that she would take such a
revenge from her brother's murderers..

1428
01:55:06,710 --> 01:55:10,840
..that they would be scared
to come into this world again.

1429
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:14,670
Brothers have fought an epic war
against each other earlier as well.

1430
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:18,000
It is known to everyone
as Mahabharata.

1431
01:55:18,250 --> 01:55:22,380
And that war was also fought
because of a woman, Draupadi.

1432
01:55:23,380 --> 01:55:25,960
And this Draupadi is the
cause of this Mahabharata..

1433
01:55:26,300 --> 01:55:27,920
..in the lives of you two brothers.

1434
01:55:28,420 --> 01:55:30,170
I danced at the club
that day so that..

1435
01:55:30,340 --> 01:55:33,590
..I could make both of
you dance to my tunes in future.

1436
01:55:34,250 --> 01:55:38,550
Your biggest weakness
became my biggest strength.

1437
01:55:39,380 --> 01:55:44,800
The lure of my body and my
face made both of you lose your mind.

1438
01:55:45,250 --> 01:55:46,920
I played such a game..

1439
01:55:47,130 --> 01:55:50,050
..that both the rules
and the game belonged to me!

1440
01:55:52,420 --> 01:55:53,750
I am not done with the story.

1441
01:55:54,090 --> 01:55:57,050
If I wanted,
I could have killed Rajveer.

1442
01:55:57,420 --> 01:56:01,340
But the feeling I got by
making one brother kill another..

1443
01:56:01,420 --> 01:56:03,130
This revenge felt like nirvana.

1444
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:05,000
"I killed him, Tasha!"

1445
01:56:05,300 --> 01:56:06,880
"I killed my own brother!"

1446
01:56:07,090 --> 01:56:07,920
"What should we do?"

1447
01:56:08,050 --> 01:56:09,130
"Should we call dad?"

1448
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:15,920
As soon as Ron told me
that Monica knows everything..

1449
01:56:16,050 --> 01:56:19,710
..I decided that I should
tell everyone everything about you.

1450
01:56:20,420 --> 01:56:24,170
By now the video clips of Rajveer's
murder must have gone viral, everywhere.

1451
01:56:24,670 --> 01:56:26,880
Police too must have
found Rajveer's body.

1452
01:56:35,590 --> 01:56:36,840
The information is right.

1453
01:56:37,250 --> 01:56:38,460
We found the body.

1454
01:56:40,670 --> 01:56:43,670
In fact, the police will soon be here.

1455
01:56:44,090 --> 01:56:46,460
You will get arrested
for your brother's murder.

1456
01:56:47,090 --> 01:56:50,090
And with that, both the game
and the story will come to an end.

1457
01:57:38,670 --> 01:57:40,670
Calm down. Calm down.

1458
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:44,710
- Please save my life.
- You are fine. It's okay.

1459
01:57:45,170 --> 01:57:47,880
Calm down,
you're going to be fine. Okay.

1460
01:57:48,130 --> 01:57:49,800
Okay..

1461
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:51,880
- See what he did! So much of blood..
- We've called the doctor.

1462
01:57:51,960 --> 01:57:54,960
It's gonna be absolutely fine.
It's gonna be fine.

1463
01:57:55,090 --> 01:57:58,090
Madam, you are safe.
You are absolutely safe..

1464
01:57:58,670 --> 01:58:00,670
Okay madam, you are absolutely safe.

1465
01:58:01,250 --> 01:58:03,000
- Please take him away.
- Get up!

1466
01:58:05,090 --> 01:58:06,550
Alright. Let's out of here.

1467
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:09,170
Officer..

1468
01:58:10,050 --> 01:58:12,750
I'm arresting you on suspicion
of the murder of your brother.

1469
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:14,420
What? I haven't done anything!

1470
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:16,920
- She's.. she's responsible!
- Alright.

1471
01:58:17,050 --> 01:58:18,000
Just listen to me.

1472
01:58:18,090 --> 01:58:19,750
- You speak to her.
- Just calm down, sir.

1473
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:21,250
Come with us.
You can explain it all later.

1474
01:58:21,340 --> 01:58:22,170
- No!
- Come.

1475
01:58:22,250 --> 01:58:23,550
- I haven't done a single bloody thing.
- Sir!

1476
01:58:23,670 --> 01:58:24,960
- Let's go.
- Come on.

1477
01:58:25,090 --> 01:58:26,670
- Move.
- Calm down.

1478
01:58:26,750 --> 01:58:28,420
- Move. Move out of here.
- Come on!

1479
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
- Come on.
- Come on. We have place for you.

1480
01:59:48,090 --> 01:59:50,590
'The nomination for the mayoral
election of business tycoon..'

1481
01:59:50,670 --> 01:59:52,710
'..Vikram Khurana has been cancelled.'

1482
01:59:53,050 --> 01:59:55,800
'The decision has been made on the bases
of the murder case in his family.'

1483
01:59:55,880 --> 01:59:59,050
'His elder son Aryan Khurana
is currently in police custody..'

1484
01:59:59,130 --> 02:00:01,000
'..charged for the murder
of his younger brother Rajveer..'

1485
02:00:01,090 --> 02:00:05,130
Aryan hasn't killed Rajveer, you have.

1486
02:00:05,710 --> 02:00:09,210
A father's job is not to fulfill
all whims and fancies of his sons.

1487
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:11,590
It is to being them up right.

1488
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:15,670
You are a father..

1489
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:23,090
..who has given both..
life and death to his sons.

1490
02:00:24,050 --> 02:00:27,800
It is a father's duty
to protect his sons.

1491
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:33,590
But I helped them for
my own selfish reasons.

1492
02:00:34,300 --> 02:00:35,420
And today..

1493
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:38,800
I lost everything.

1494
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:43,460
Name, fame, status..

1495
02:00:45,130 --> 02:00:46,340
And my sons.

1496
02:00:50,170 --> 02:00:52,960
You took revenge for a relationship.

1497
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:57,300
And I chose myself over relationships.

1498
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:42,210
Both a war and a game of chess
cannot be won without soldiers.

1499
02:01:44,050 --> 02:01:47,840
So Ron will be our
soldier in this war.

1500
02:01:48,670 --> 02:01:50,800
Yes, he's a soldier and a friend.

1501
02:01:51,130 --> 02:01:53,300
He will stay true to
his friendship and his duty.

1502
02:02:08,130 --> 02:02:11,130
Tasha, she is dead. We're alive.

1503
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:12,710
Think about that.

1504
02:02:13,130 --> 02:02:15,300
Everything will be fine. Okay.

1505
02:02:36,590 --> 02:02:39,380
I couldn't spend my
life with your brother..

1506
02:02:41,300 --> 02:02:44,300
..but because of you, by helping you..

1507
02:02:45,050 --> 02:02:47,300
..I could finally take
revenge for his death.

1508
02:02:48,460 --> 02:02:49,460
No, Rishma.

1509
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:53,210
If by taking advantage
of your education in UK..

1510
02:02:53,670 --> 02:02:57,670
..you hadn't made a place for yourself
in Aryan's company and his life..

1511
02:02:58,090 --> 02:03:00,590
..then our plan would
have never succeeded.

1512
02:03:01,050 --> 02:03:03,170
The bullets in that gun were fake and..

1513
02:03:05,420 --> 02:03:09,000
The move of Rishma's fake death
got Rajveer dead for real..

1514
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:12,420
..and gave Aryan
a life worse than death.

1515
02:03:13,880 --> 02:03:16,420
Whatever you did,
you did for your brother, as a sister..

1516
02:03:17,170 --> 02:03:19,000
And I did it for my love.

1517
02:03:20,710 --> 02:03:21,920
And I am proud of him.

1518
02:03:25,420 --> 02:03:26,460
I am happy..

1519
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:29,250
..that I gathered courage
to help you that day..

1520
02:03:30,380 --> 02:03:33,460
..by giving you their
names and identities.

1521
02:03:36,090 --> 02:03:38,090
That night Ashwin had said..

1522
02:03:38,670 --> 02:03:40,250
That I must be someone's sister.

1523
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:42,340
And today, I say..

1524
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:46,340
That every sister should
have a brother like Ashwin.

1525
02:03:47,210 --> 02:03:48,300
And every brother..

1526
02:03:49,750 --> 02:03:51,050
Should get a sister like you.
