1
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,583
<i>I have fought the good fight.</i>

2
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,917
<i>I have finished the race.</i>

3
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,583
<i>I have kept the faith.</i>

4
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:06,750
<i>I</i>

5
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:08,583
<i>am crazy.</i>

6
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:13,417
<i>Seriously.</i>

7
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,542
<i>I'm really crazy.</i>

8
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,083
<i>There's no cure for it.</i>

9
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:20,208
<i>It can't be treated.</i>

10
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:21,917
<i>This illness</i>

11
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:23,833
<i>is hopeless.</i>

12
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:42,792
<i>The cartoon on TV earlier</i>

13
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,708
<i>is called Super Clown.</i>

14
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:47,000
<i>I don't really like this cartoon.</i>

15
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,500
<i>But that scene of the clown fighting</i>

16
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,333
<i>has been imprinted on my mind</i>

17
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:55,167
<i>since my eighth birthday.</i>

18
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:04,458
<i>Ever since that day,</i>

19
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,792
<i>I've got this weird illness.</i>

20
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:10,000
<i>I always feel
there's a clown living inside me.</i>

21
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:12,333
<i>Whenever I get emotional,</i>

22
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:14,917
<i>this clown would jump out.</i>

23
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,208
<i>My brain</i>

24
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:20,042
<i>would feel like it's drowning in Vodka.</i>

25
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,500
<i>It becomes paralyzed.</i>

26
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,458
<i>At this moment,</i>

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,583
<i>the people in front of my eyes turn
into all kinds of strange creatures</i>

28
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:29,208
<i>and start to attack me.</i>

29
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:58,375
<i>The doctor says
it's a psychological disorder.</i>

30
00:02:58,583 --> 00:02:59,583
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

31
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,583
<i>I feel that my life</i>

32
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:05,208
<i>must have some mysterious connection
with clowns.</i>

33
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,208
<i>Because people say</i>

34
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:11,792
<i>that I'm a clown in life too.</i>

35
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,250
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

36
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:18,792
<i>What matters is you keep this in mind.</i>

37
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:20,375
<i>I</i>

38
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,125
<i>am crazy.</i>

39
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,375
Zheng Kai-si.

40
00:03:58,792 --> 00:03:59,875
I'm telling you,

41
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,917
if you don't want to do this,
go tell the manager.

42
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,958
Stop daydreaming.

43
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,375
Hey.

44
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,375
You won't get any bonus
if you fail to achieve this month's goal.

45
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:22,833
Are you happy?

46
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:24,958
Little girl.

47
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:27,125
I have a small gift for you.

48
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:29,000
-Thank you.
-Here's your phone.

49
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:30,375
Please give me a few seconds.

50
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,208
I didn't know you miss me so much.

51
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,000
Aren't you really excited to see me?

52
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,542
What are you doing here?

53
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:54,500
Get to the point.

54
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,000
I don't have time for bullshit.

55
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,583
Go Nicolas Town.

56
00:06:58,667 --> 00:06:59,875
Ever heard of it?

57
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:00,917
It's in the downtown area.

58
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,833
Luxurious condos.

59
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:03,792
Private elevator.
Great lighting and air circulation.

60
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:05,958
Did selling houses make you stupid?

61
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:09,333
What on earth makes you think
that I could afford a house?

62
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,750
I have a suite that's worth 12 million.

63
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,542
The homeowner is badly in need of money.

64
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:15,792
He'll sell it for six million.

65
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,917
I haven't told anyone else.

66
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,042
Not even my boss.

67
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:20,958
But my client wants to be paid in full.

68
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:23,417
I mortgaged my apartment
and got over two million.

69
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,708
I still need about three million more.

70
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,958
Regarding your apartment,

71
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:30,208
who owns it?

72
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,583
Don't even think about it.

73
00:07:32,042 --> 00:07:33,208
No way in hell.

74
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:35,208
It's been years since my dad passed away.

75
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:36,917
This apartment
is the only thing he left us.

76
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,125
How can I sell it?

77
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,750
It's not selling.

78
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:40,750
You mortgage it.

79
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,500
Same thing to me.

80
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,833
If my mom wakes up and finds out
that I sold the apartment,

81
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:47,125
she's going to kick my ass.

82
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:50,167
Your mom has been in a coma for years.

83
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,542
She's not going to wake up.

84
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,375
What's your problem?

85
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:58,500
We'll make six million on this deal.

86
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,500
It's a really good deal.

87
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,208
Why did I tell you?

88
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,208
I'm looking out for you, buddy.

89
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,625
You've been taking care
of a vegetable for many years.

90
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,000
Medical bills.

91
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,542
-Nursing fees.
-Stop worrying about my mom.

92
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,500
Insurance covers half,

93
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,458
and Liu Qing helps me with nursing.

94
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:16,958
You have to think about Liu Qing.

95
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,000
You don't even have money to marry her.

96
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,250
Let me tell you one more time.

97
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,875
We are not dating.

98
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,042
Then what are you guys?

99
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:25,458
We are friends,

100
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:26,917
classmates,

101
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:28,542
old neighbors.

102
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,250
Then why do you keep her photo?

103
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:36,833
You think you're too poor
and don't want to drag her down.

104
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:42,292
Please go figure out your own life

105
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
before coming here and talking about mine.

106
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,083
Ms. Liu, how are you feeling?

107
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:43,125
Much better.

108
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:49,667
You jerk.

109
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:00,917
Out of money again?

110
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:06,375
One thousand.

111
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:08,250
Didn't you just get paid on the third?

112
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,833
I was late for work a couple of times.

113
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:13,083
My pay was deducted.

114
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,833
Can you act like an adult?

115
00:10:15,042 --> 00:10:15,917
Yes, I can.

116
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,042
Would you lend me some money?

117
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:21,333
The head nurse says if we don't pay up,
Mom will be sleeping in the hallway.

118
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,833
Won't you feel sad

119
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,708
if our mom is in the hallway?

120
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,417
Don't call her our mom all the time.

121
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,250
I'm not your wife.

122
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,083
Zheng Kai-si.

123
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,042
I have six patients
waiting for drip infusion.

124
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:40,958
If you want to act like a jerk,

125
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:42,375
please do it at another time.

126
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,792
<i>Is Liu Qing there?</i>

127
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:48,833
Yes, I'm here.

128
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:51,250
<i>I need a Glycerine Enema.</i>

129
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,792
Okay. Please wait for a second.

130
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,333
Disgusting.

131
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:58,958
Take off your pants.

132
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,667
You help me.

133
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,083
Do you need it or not?

134
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,083
Of course.

135
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,250
Hurry up.

136
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,875
You hurry up.

137
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:13,125
Stop laughing.

138
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,167
Come out here.

139
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:18,917
What are you doing?

140
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,958
-Can't you see he's messing with you?
-I know, so what?

141
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:23,000
This is my job.

142
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:24,250
Then you should quit.

143
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:26,833
Quit?

144
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,250
Are you going to provide for me?

145
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,333
Qing.

146
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,125
Nurse.

147
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:35,208
Qing.

148
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:37,917
I'm waiting for you.

149
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:45,542
Be gentle.

150
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,000
Stop hitting him!

151
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,958
Stop hitting him!

152
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:56,167
Stop hitting him!

153
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,250
-Li.
-Stop hitting him.

154
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,750
Li. What's wrong, Li?

155
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,167
Stop fighting. See, you've frightened Li.

156
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:02,958
What's wrong with him?

157
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:04,000
Li.

158
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:12,792
Okay.

159
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,625
Where is the head nurse?

160
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,417
In her office.

161
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,833
Would you stay away from Kai-si?

162
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:44,583
He always gets into trouble.

163
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,375
Why don't you keep that in mind?

164
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:49,333
Your dad went to great lengths

165
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:50,708
to get you transferred here.

166
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,792
It's not worth it if you get demoted

167
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,167
because of him.

168
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:55,583
Ms. Chen.

169
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:56,875
Don't say that.

170
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,125
He wouldn't become this way

171
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,958
if not for his mom.

172
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:01,583
He was the smartest kid
in our neighborhood.

173
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:02,958
Are you still defending him?

174
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,667
Anyway, don't blame Zheng Kai-si for it.

175
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,375
You can deduct from my salary

176
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,958
if anyone asks for compensation.

177
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,542
What if Mr. Li didn't make it today?

178
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:16,833
Can you take the blame?

179
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,250
Dr. Ma came back from France

180
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:23,917
and brought you a bag.

181
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,458
Get it from my locker after your shift.

182
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,375
You keep it.

183
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:31,292
Listen, he bought it in France for you.

184
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,667
Why would I keep it?

185
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,250
Text him later

186
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,708
and thank him.

187
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:39,000
Get to know each other.

188
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:54,875
Take this.

189
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm not hungry.

190
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:01,292
I'll have some noodles.

191
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:02,958
Take it.

192
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,083
I just microwaved it.

193
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,250
It's getting cold.

194
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:11,958
I have to hand in my salaries
to my dad now.

195
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,500
This is all I have.

196
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:15,833
Take it.

197
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,292
I don't need it.

198
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,417
I'll figure out tomorrow.

199
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,917
There was a mass food poisoning today.

200
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,042
Some are in a critical state.

201
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:40,000
That's why your mom is in the hallway.

202
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,500
But Ms. Chen said

203
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,667
that it's only temporary.

204
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:45,417
Liu Qing.

205
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:49,583
If you meet someone right for you,

206
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,083
just marry him.

207
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:01,458
I found him long ago.

208
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,625
But he won't marry me.

209
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:54,917
Mom.

210
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:59,292
Is there an end to this?

211
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,042
You are always the tough one.

212
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,708
Now that you're lying here,
how can you take it any longer?

213
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,417
Mom, ask your colleagues and friends

214
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:14,417
what your son has become.

215
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:18,708
He can't even afford your medical bill.

216
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,167
I'm sorry, Mom.

217
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,375
<i>Hello, this is Good Guys Real Estate.</i>

218
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,708
<i>I'm Li Jun, your property consultant.</i>

219
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:57,667
<i>Hello.</i>

220
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,958
It's under my mom's name.

221
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:03,667
Can it be mortgaged?

222
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,208
All done.

223
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:12,458
Give me the deed.

224
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,625
I'll have another look at the contract.

225
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,333
It's all in English.

226
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:21,458
Do you speak English?

227
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,042
Don't worry.

228
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,042
My lawyer has made sure that it's good.

229
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,125
Perfect.

230
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,875
Big Shrimp.

231
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:37,375
If you mess this up,

232
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,125
I'll beat you up.

233
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:41,875
If I mess this up,

234
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,792
my dad will kill me

235
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,708
in no time.

236
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:36,458
A pack of cigarettes.

237
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:37,750
The yellow one.

238
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,417
DUODUO GROCERY

239
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,208
Hey, girl.

240
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:15,667
Look at this.

241
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,667
I handmade these.

242
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:19,958
Please take one.

243
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:21,625
-No, thanks.
-It's two yuan each.

244
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:22,875
-No.
-What do you think?

245
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,500
It's pretty.

246
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,083
Have a look.

247
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,167
I handmade these.

248
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,542
It's two yuan each.

249
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,167
And five yuan for three.

250
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:37,750
-Please wait for your change.
-Keep it.

251
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,833
HOSPITAL

252
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:49,625
<i>Hello, this is Good Guys Real Estate.</i>

253
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,958
<i>I'm Li Jun, your property consultant.</i>

254
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:58,500
<i>Sorry. The subscriber you dialed

255
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,083
LI JUN

256
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:27,292
<i>I'm so sorry, buddy.</i>

257
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,042
<i>I'll do anything to make it up</i>

258
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,125
<i>if I have the chance.</i>

259
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,250
<i>I'm so sorry, buddy.</i>

260
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,042

00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,042
<i>if I have the chance.</i>

262
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,250
<i>What's your relationship with Li Jun?</i>

263
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,000
<i>We are friends.</i>

264
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:31,542
Here's the thing.

265
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,250
He was fired

266
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,167
two months ago.

267
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:38,333
He stole the seal from finance,

268
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:40,292
conned a client's down payment,

269
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:41,583
then he vanished.

270
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,250
Our company--

271
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,917
UNKNOWN

272
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,083
Hello?

273
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:50,875
<i>You are in the wrong place.</i>

274
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:52,958
Who is this?

275
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:54,667
<i>Get up.</i>

276
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,958
<i>And go to the window on your left.</i>

277
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:16,792
What?

278
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,625
I want to talk to Li Jun.

279
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,000
Then why should I believe you?

280
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:34,875
<i>I'm so sorry, buddy.</i>

281
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:36,667
<i>I'll do anything to make it up</i>

282
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:37,875
<i>if I have the chance.</i>

283
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:00,500
What kind of game is it?

284
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:18,708
What's the worst-case scenario?

285
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,708
<i>Are you going to provide for me?</i>

286
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:38,083
<i>I found him long ago.</i>

287
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:00,917
ZHENG KAI-SI

288
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,833
I'm going on a business trip.

289
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:19,500
Please take care of my mom.

290
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:21,750
This is my mom's medical history.
Bankcard and--

291
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:23,125
What do you need your passport for?

292
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,417
I told you I'm going on a business trip.

293
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:29,792
Don't lie to me.

294
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,583
That arcade you work for,

295
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:33,500
what business takes you overseas?

296
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,708
What kind of trouble did you get into?

297
00:27:39,542 --> 00:27:40,500
Are you trying to flee?

298
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:47,083
I saw Li Jun the other day.

299
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,917
Who was that man in black?

300
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:51,792
Is he a mafia?

301
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:54,667
Why are you laughing?

302
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:06,708
This is for you.

303
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:08,750
It's cheap, but it's all I have.

304
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,833
I'm leaving my mom to you.

305
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:19,042
If I don't come back in a week,

306
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:21,667
unhook her from the respirator.

307
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,167
Zheng Kai-si.

308
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,917
Can you stay?

309
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:29,000
If you need money,

310
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,958
I'll see what I can do.

311
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:37,375
One week.

312
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:41,000
If I come back,

313
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:45,000
I will never leave you again.

314
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,583
If I don't come back,

315
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:52,542
don't waste your time on me.

316
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:54,500
Just move on.

317
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:55,917
I can't move on.

318
00:28:56,917 --> 00:28:58,417
If you're leaving,

319
00:28:58,917 --> 00:29:00,917
then I'll wait for you

320
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:02,458
until the day I die.

321
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,125
Liu Qing!

322
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:10,167
-There's an emergency at bed 16!
-I'm coming!

323
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,542
Hurry up!

324
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,042
Don't leave.

325
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:15,708
Stay here. We're not done.

326
00:29:16,292 --> 00:29:17,167
Don't leave.

327
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,542
<i>Leave everything else to us.</i>

328
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:50,083
<i>Just sleep.</i>

329
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:51,708
<i>When you wake up,</i>

330
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:54,292
<i>you will be where you need to be.</i>

331
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:02,333
<i>This is an anesthetic we developed.</i>

332
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,792
It will help you sleep better.

333
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:33,958
No!

334
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:38,167
No! Leave me alone!

335
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:42,000
Stop hitting me! I don't want to die!

336
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:43,792
Leave me alone!

337
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,833
Chinese, right?

338
00:41:05,417 --> 00:41:06,792
I'm Zhang Jing-kun.

339
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,333
Zheng Kai-si.

340
00:41:12,542 --> 00:41:14,417
Do you know why there are so many cameras?

341
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:18,625
We are here playing rock, scissors, paper.

342
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:20,375
Meanwhile, a lot of rich guys are upstairs

343
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,375
watching the live feed and betting on us.

344
00:41:23,792 --> 00:41:24,875
Think about it.

345
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:28,375
<i>They got us here from all over the world.</i>

346
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:30,458
<i>It must've cost a fortune to fly us here.</i>

347
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,708
<i>Guess how they make profit?</i>

348
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:34,000
<i>They need those rich guys.</i>

349
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,542
<i>This is not the first time I'm here.</i>

350
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:38,542
And I'm telling you,

351
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:40,708
many of the players are not rookies.

352
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:43,833
Everyone has his own purpose to be here.

353
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,750
Mine is to get my loan cleared

354
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:48,292
and leave the ship in one piece.

355
00:41:48,792 --> 00:41:50,292
This is far out of our depth.

356
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:51,958
We should get out as soon as possible.

357
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,375
Who doesn't want to get out?

358
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:56,958
I can leave if I give you all my cards.

359
00:41:57,417 --> 00:41:58,500
Would you take them?

360
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:02,958
Don't forget it's a tie
if we choose the same card.

361
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,042
By this rule,

362
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:11,750
if we find the right partner,

363
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:13,750
we can get off the ship alive for sure.

364
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:17,833
Unfortunately, most people are greedy.

365
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:19,875
It's human nature.

366
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:24,250
Get the cards in the same order as mine.

367
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,250
Scissors, rock and paper.
Divide into four groups.

368
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:29,750
If you make up your mind,
meet me at Table Six.

369
00:42:29,917 --> 00:42:31,417
Play cards in this order.

370
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:33,917
Twelve draws.
We will get it done in three minutes.

371
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:54,667
ALL PREJUDICES COME FROM THE GUTS

372
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,875
Sorry, buddy.

373
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:33,333
I accidentally messed up the order.

374
00:44:34,667 --> 00:44:35,750
Don't worry.

375
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,042
Next round, you play rock
and I'll play scissors.

376
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:41,125
You'll get the star back.

377
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:42,792
Come on.

378
00:45:27,917 --> 00:45:29,125
You are cheating.

379
00:45:29,375 --> 00:45:30,875
He cheated. Referee, he cheated!

380
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:32,042
Referee, he...

381
00:45:40,917 --> 00:45:42,917
When that white guy explained the rules,

382
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,500
did he say anything about no cheating?

383
00:45:46,917 --> 00:45:48,000
Relax.

384
00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:51,708
You can buy the stars back
when the game is over.

385
00:45:53,958 --> 00:45:55,500
Just get your money ready.

386
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:09,500
No.

387
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:11,958
You Westerner, are you even human?

388
00:46:13,625 --> 00:46:14,833
I can't accept this.

389
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:17,875
I'm a human.

390
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:19,958
I won't let you butcher me.

391
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,000
My money!

392
00:48:04,458 --> 00:48:07,417
<i>Zheng Kai-si.</i>

393
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:18,333
<i>Zheng Kai-si.</i>

394
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:23,000
<i>Zheng Kai-si.</i>

395
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:25,042
<i>Zheng Kai-si.</i>

396
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:28,417
Zheng Kai-si.

397
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,583
Zheng Kai-si.

398
00:48:32,417 --> 00:48:33,500
Li Jun.

399
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:39,917
Why are you here?

400
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:42,250
Where else should I be?

401
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:45,750
You should go to hell.

402
00:48:46,917 --> 00:48:47,833
You are a liar!

403
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:48,958
You're a big liar!

404
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:50,458
Give my deed back.

405
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:08,792
You have me as your guarantor.

406
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,542
Why did you end up here?

407
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:13,583
I want to try my luck.

408
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:15,083
If I'm lucky,

409
00:49:15,167 --> 00:49:17,333
I will win back your apartment.

410
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,375
If I knew what you drag me into,

411
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,417
I should've pushed you off my balcony

412
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:26,083
and let you die.

413
00:49:26,208 --> 00:49:27,708
I won't complain if you kill me.

414
00:49:28,667 --> 00:49:30,417
But I won't die without a fight

415
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:31,750
if they try to kill me.

416
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:34,250
I don't think they dare to kill us.

417
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:36,042
Come one, buddy.

418
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:37,417
We are in international waters now.

419
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:40,000
If they toss our bodies off the ship,
no one will know.

420
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:41,667
Who will pay back the money
if they kill us?

421
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:42,833
Are they idiots?

422
00:49:43,458 --> 00:49:44,875
See that mirror over there?

423
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:48,875
All the eliminated are locked behind it.

424
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,833
They call it the black room.

425
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:54,625
Everyone inside it
will have a chance to get out

426
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:56,792
during the last ten minutes.

427
00:49:56,875 --> 00:49:58,167
If no one gets you out,

428
00:49:58,375 --> 00:50:00,625
you'll be taken to the bottom of the ship.

429
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:02,500
There's a medical lab.

430
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,917
And we'll pay the debt as lab rats.

431
00:50:05,167 --> 00:50:06,208
Who told you that?

432
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,125
One of the guys in my cage.

433
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:09,667
He's been here three times.

434
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:13,125
How did you know them?

435
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:18,458
I went to Macau on a company trip.

436
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:21,417
I lost everything in the casino.

437
00:50:21,833 --> 00:50:23,292
They came to me

438
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:25,208
and lent me a loan without collaterals.

439
00:50:25,833 --> 00:50:28,458
But the interest was calculated daily.

440
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,917
There was no other way,
but selling my dad's apartment.

441
00:50:33,792 --> 00:50:35,458
But I couldn't resign myself to it.

442
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:41,000
So, I took a client's down payment
and went to Macau again.

443
00:50:42,042 --> 00:50:43,667
I lost everything.

444
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:46,292
So, you decided to con me?

445
00:50:47,458 --> 00:50:49,292
I thought it had to be

446
00:50:50,875 --> 00:50:52,500
my turn to win.

447
00:50:52,958 --> 00:50:54,208
Where does your dad live now?

448
00:50:58,292 --> 00:50:59,333
At a nursing home.

449
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:37,042
We have less than two hours.

450
00:51:37,292 --> 00:51:39,333
We're not going to die here.

451
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:42,167
We each have one star left.

452
00:51:45,542 --> 00:51:46,792
We can't keep going like this.

453
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:50,333
There's no room for error.

454
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:52,333
We need to find someone

455
00:51:53,167 --> 00:51:54,542
who possesses two stars

456
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:57,375
with no card.

457
00:51:57,917 --> 00:52:01,292
We'll use one of his two stars
as a backup.

458
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,583
I saw one.

459
00:52:13,875 --> 00:52:14,833
No way.

460
00:52:16,208 --> 00:52:18,583
What if you trick me?

461
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,625
You don't have any cards left.

462
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:23,708
You have a better chance with us
rather than doing nothing.

463
00:52:24,042 --> 00:52:27,625
I have no cards left,
but I can buy stars afterward.

464
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,000
Those people,

465
00:52:31,083 --> 00:52:32,750
all of them have the same plan.

466
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:34,375
Are you sure you'll have enough money?

467
00:52:34,792 --> 00:52:35,917
Okay, then.

468
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:39,292
Show me all of your cards.

469
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:56,875
I'll trust you this time.

470
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:27,917
I'll trust you this time.

471
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,125
Shit.

472
00:54:01,667 --> 00:54:02,917
Thanks for your star.

473
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,583
You lied to us.

474
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:16,250
Stop crying!

475
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:19,333
You thief!

476
00:54:27,792 --> 00:54:29,208
Damn it.

477
00:54:37,917 --> 00:54:38,833
Sir.

478
00:54:39,792 --> 00:54:40,750
I'm begging you.

479
00:54:41,167 --> 00:54:43,208
Please don't leave me here.

480
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:45,000
I...

481
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:47,042
I only have one star now.

482
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:48,917
I don't want to be a slave.

483
00:54:49,292 --> 00:54:50,250
Slave?

484
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:52,792
If you lose, you are going to die.

485
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,500
No way.

486
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,542
I need to go home.

487
00:54:56,875 --> 00:54:58,292
I have to get off this ship.

488
00:54:58,417 --> 00:54:59,333
My daughter.

489
00:54:59,417 --> 00:55:01,083
She's waiting for me at home.

490
00:55:02,042 --> 00:55:04,958
See, this is my daughter.

491
00:55:05,042 --> 00:55:06,833
Please.

492
00:55:10,333 --> 00:55:12,458
Who's looking after her now?

493
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
My mom.

494
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:16,458
My mom has cataracts in both eyes.

495
00:55:16,875 --> 00:55:18,708
She is almost blind. She can't even cook.

496
00:55:18,792 --> 00:55:19,917
What's your name?

497
00:55:22,208 --> 00:55:23,458
Meng Guo-xiang.

498
00:55:23,917 --> 00:55:25,708
You can call me Fatty Meng.

499
00:55:26,167 --> 00:55:27,292
Kai-si.

500
00:55:28,667 --> 00:55:29,875
Don't soften up.

501
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:32,167
He just stole our card.
You're not going to believe him, right?

502
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,167
Buddy.

503
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:36,542
I didn't mean to steal your card.

504
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,125
I got tricked too many times.

505
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:43,458
Besides, you got four scissors
and one paper.

506
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:46,417
Anyone would be suspicious.

507
00:55:46,542 --> 00:55:47,458
Why?

508
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:49,250
It doesn't make sense.

509
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:55,167
Normally people would keep
each type of cards balanced.

510
00:55:55,792 --> 00:55:58,583
But you have almost all scissors.

511
00:55:59,125 --> 00:56:00,583
What if someone saw it?

512
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:02,500
You'd become the targets.

513
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:04,708
He has a point.

514
00:56:05,083 --> 00:56:08,792
-If you tell anyone, you're dead...
-Shh!

515
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,375
<i>Everyone has 12 cards.</i>

516
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:23,292
<i>One scissors, one rock
and one paper in a group,</i>

517
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,208
<i>divided into four groups.</i>

518
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:29,083
<i>Assuming that he plays his cards balanced,</i>

519
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:32,292
<i>no matter in what order
he plays out his first three cards,</i>

520
00:56:32,958 --> 00:56:37,292
<i>he'll play out one card for each type.</i>

521
00:56:37,625 --> 00:56:38,667
<i>If next round</i>

522
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:40,708
<i>he plays scissors and rock,</i>

523
00:56:40,792 --> 00:56:43,542
<i>and hopes to keep his cards balanced,</i>

524
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:44,875
<i>for round three...</i>

525
00:56:45,042 --> 00:56:46,500
<i>He'll surely play paper.</i>

526
00:56:46,958 --> 00:56:48,250
<i>Not exactly.</i>

527
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:52,208
If someone plays paper, scissors, paper,
for his first three cards,

528
00:56:52,292 --> 00:56:54,500
and rock, scissors, rock, for next,

529
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:56,583
his cards still remain balanced.

530
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,042
Buddy, you have a weird logic.

531
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,958
If he plays the way as you said,

532
00:57:03,792 --> 00:57:06,542
when he has three cards remaining,
he'll only have two types of cards.

533
00:57:08,167 --> 00:57:09,000
Yes.

534
00:57:09,167 --> 00:57:10,417
You lost me, but keep going.

535
00:57:10,542 --> 00:57:12,792
I copied all your Math papers anyway.

536
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:23,500
<i>You guys go find someone
with nine cards left.</i>

537
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:24,625
<i>Keep an eye on him.</i>

538
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:27,125
<i>If he plays rock and scissors
in the next two rounds,</i>

539
00:57:27,208 --> 00:57:28,208
<i>tell me immediately.</i>

540
00:57:28,958 --> 00:57:30,375
<i>The order doesn't matter.</i>

541
00:57:30,875 --> 00:57:31,917
<i>Go and find this guy.</i>

542
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,083
<i>I'll go get a loan</i>

543
00:57:33,458 --> 00:57:35,333
<i>and see if we can buy a star
as our backup.</i>

544
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:38,750
I need 500,000.

545
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:51,208
This much?

546
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,292
We need to be prepared.

547
00:57:54,458 --> 00:57:55,583
We found the guy.

548
00:57:55,958 --> 00:57:57,250
Fatty Meng is tailing him.

549
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:00,583
Which one?

550
00:58:02,333 --> 00:58:03,958
That guy with a beard over there.

551
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:11,458
No time to buy another star.

552
00:58:12,083 --> 00:58:13,208
We have to try our luck.

553
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,250
I'm telling you, Fatty,

554
00:58:18,417 --> 00:58:20,625
we share this loan equally.

555
00:58:21,292 --> 00:58:22,375
Okay.

556
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:28,167
Do you want to play?

557
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,708
Why not?

558
00:59:12,875 --> 00:59:14,250
Yes, we got him!

559
00:59:25,875 --> 00:59:26,958
Wait.

560
00:59:28,583 --> 00:59:30,375
Are you sure we're going to hell?

561
00:59:31,792 --> 00:59:33,000
Dare to go for another round?

562
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:34,667
-Are you insane?
-Stay out of it.

563
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,375
Are you game?

564
00:59:57,083 --> 00:59:58,667
Kai-si, we don't have to play with him.

565
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:01,292
We can find other players with nine cards.

566
01:00:01,958 --> 01:00:04,875
That's right, we should stop.

567
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I accept.

568
01:00:42,042 --> 01:00:43,958
This won't end well for us.

569
01:00:44,667 --> 01:00:46,500
If we lose in the next two rounds,

570
01:00:46,708 --> 01:00:48,917
two of us will end up in the black room.

571
01:00:49,292 --> 01:00:51,125
Can't you tell I'm putting on an act?

572
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:56,833
Think about it.

573
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:00,625
<i>Why would he suddenly want to play
three consecutive rounds</i>

574
01:01:00,917 --> 01:01:04,625
<i>without me changing cards
when he saw I have three cards left?</i>

575
01:01:05,917 --> 01:01:06,958
<i>I guess...</i>

576
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:09,792
<i>No.</i>

577
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:12,333
<i>After the first win,</i>

578
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:16,000
<i>I'm sure he's using the balance mind.</i>

579
01:01:16,583 --> 01:01:17,792
<i>This conventional thinking</i>

580
01:01:18,167 --> 01:01:20,542
<i>makes him believe
that the three cards in my hand</i>

581
01:01:20,667 --> 01:01:21,958
<i>must be balanced too,</i>

582
01:01:22,792 --> 01:01:26,542
<i>which are scissors, rock, and paper.</i>

583
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:30,958
<i>Just now I played out scissors.</i>

584
01:01:31,292 --> 01:01:32,667
<i>So, he believes </i>

585
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:34,208
<i>that the remaining cards</i>

586
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:36,667
<i>are one rock and one paper.</i>

587
01:01:37,708 --> 01:01:39,583
<i>As long as he plays paper twice,</i>

588
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:41,583
<i>he'll win at least one star.</i>

589
01:01:42,292 --> 01:01:44,667
<i>That's why he wants to play
with me three times.</i>

590
01:01:45,167 --> 01:01:47,000
<i>But he could never imagine</i>

591
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:48,792
<i>that the cards we have</i>

592
01:01:49,875 --> 01:01:51,500
<i>are all scissors.</i>

593
01:01:54,833 --> 01:01:56,500
Whether you get it or not,

594
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:59,292
don't nod or show
any expression on your face.

595
01:01:59,667 --> 01:02:00,667
And

596
01:02:02,542 --> 01:02:03,833
shut your mouth.

597
01:02:39,292 --> 01:02:40,500
Surprise.

598
01:04:44,167 --> 01:04:45,500
We are doomed.

599
01:04:45,583 --> 01:04:47,083
They really dare kill people.

600
01:04:48,333 --> 01:04:50,000
If we lose, we are going to die.

601
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:52,708
-What are we going to do?
-Stop it.

602
01:04:52,792 --> 01:04:54,208
You are talking too much.

603
01:04:55,042 --> 01:04:55,875
Kai-si.

604
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:58,333
There are fewer cards every minute.

605
01:04:58,417 --> 01:05:00,625
It's now or never.

606
01:05:00,708 --> 01:05:01,583
No.

607
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:04,208
I think

608
01:05:04,792 --> 01:05:06,958
we should save the money
for stars in the end.

609
01:05:07,083 --> 01:05:09,583
We need four more stars to survive,

610
01:05:09,667 --> 01:05:11,792
but each person has an average
of less than three stars now.

611
01:05:12,042 --> 01:05:14,125
But if you buy cards with the money,

612
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:17,375
which kind of cards
will guarantee our survival?

613
01:05:17,667 --> 01:05:18,750
Rocks.

614
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:24,583
Look at it.

615
01:05:25,875 --> 01:05:27,417
<i>Paper has the least left,</i>

616
01:05:27,917 --> 01:05:29,083
<i>scissors are the most.</i>

617
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:31,208
<i>Think of it this way.</i>

618
01:05:32,417 --> 01:05:34,208
<i>When the game begins,</i>

619
01:05:34,667 --> 01:05:36,375
<i>all types of cards begin decreasing.</i>

620
01:05:36,875 --> 01:05:39,000
<i>They are like three lit fuses.</i>

621
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,292
<i>Three hours later,</i>

622
01:05:41,417 --> 01:05:43,042
<i>the ratio of the cards looks like this.</i>

623
01:05:44,167 --> 01:05:46,042
<i>If the cards decrease in the same speed,</i>

624
01:05:46,167 --> 01:05:48,417
<i>in the time remaining,</i>

625
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:51,208
<i>papers will be the first to run out.</i>

626
01:05:54,208 --> 01:05:55,917
In this situation,

627
01:05:56,667 --> 01:05:58,750
if we only have rocks,

628
01:05:59,542 --> 01:06:01,375
<i>we could never lose.</i>

629
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:03,583
<i>That's right.</i>

630
01:06:03,792 --> 01:06:06,792
<i>We have the chance to win much more,
let alone four stars.</i>

631
01:06:11,958 --> 01:06:13,625
We can't do it by ourselves.

632
01:06:13,917 --> 01:06:16,292
No one will play with us if they find out.

633
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:19,042
<i>We need to find players with three stars.</i>

634
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:21,292
<i>Ask them to buy rocks for us.</i>

635
01:06:21,417 --> 01:06:22,333
<i>In return,</i>

636
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:25,708
<i>we pay them and take
all their remaining cards.</i>

637
01:06:26,208 --> 01:06:28,292
<i>That way, they'll be safe
to go to the second floor.</i>

638
01:06:29,167 --> 01:06:30,500
<i>After they leave,</i>

639
01:06:30,667 --> 01:06:33,583
<i>no one here will know our plan
to stock up rocks.</i>

640
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:35,333
<i>Hiring people to buy cards for us,</i>

641
01:06:35,542 --> 01:06:38,250
<i>is it against the rules?</i>

642
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:39,458
<i>It has been hours,</i>

643
01:06:39,542 --> 01:06:42,000
<i>haven't you noticed
that there are no rules?</i>

644
01:06:42,625 --> 01:06:44,250
<i>The referee is even blind to cheating,</i>

645
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:45,583
<i>right?</i>

646
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:49,167
<i>The white guy only gave
terms of elimination.</i>

647
01:06:49,583 --> 01:06:52,000
<i>Anything not mentioned is allowed.</i>

648
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,292
<i>As long as when the game is over,</i>

649
01:06:54,583 --> 01:06:58,667
<i>we each have at least three stars
and no card remaining in hand,</i>

650
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:00,708
<i>then we'll get off the ship safely.</i>

651
01:07:36,708 --> 01:07:38,083
<i>Thirty rocks.</i>

652
01:07:38,292 --> 01:07:39,625
Two scissors.

653
01:07:40,292 --> 01:07:41,375
Four papers.

654
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:43,708
Do we need more scissors and papers?

655
01:07:44,792 --> 01:07:46,208
Shall we buy more?

656
01:07:47,458 --> 01:07:48,375
No.

657
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,042
It's perfect.

658
01:07:53,292 --> 01:07:54,542
What's wrong?

659
01:07:57,208 --> 01:07:58,625
Scottish Black Sheep.

660
01:07:59,667 --> 01:08:02,000
The last Math story my dad told me.

661
01:08:03,208 --> 01:08:04,417
What?

662
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:07,500
His dad was our Math teacher.

663
01:08:08,708 --> 01:08:10,375
I've been thinking about it

664
01:08:11,167 --> 01:08:12,875
since we began buying cards.

665
01:08:13,458 --> 01:08:15,208
<i>What color is this Rubik's cube?</i>

666
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:16,125
<i>Red.</i>

667
01:08:16,208 --> 01:08:19,958
<i>Three tourists went to Scotland together
and saw a black sheep.</i>

668
01:08:20,042 --> 01:08:23,208
<i>The first one said,
"All the sheep in Scotland are black."</i>

669
01:08:23,292 --> 01:08:26,833
<i>The second one said, "It only proves
black sheep exist in Scotland."</i>

670
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,542
<i>The third one said,
"None of you are accurate."</i>

671
01:08:29,625 --> 01:08:33,083
<i>We should say right here right now,
from our point of view,</i>

672
01:08:33,167 --> 01:08:36,792
<i>that the sheep has one black side.</i>

673
01:08:37,583 --> 01:08:39,625
When we are so sure about something,

674
01:08:40,875 --> 01:08:42,875
we ignore the whole picture.

675
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:46,542
That's how that dude

676
01:08:47,417 --> 01:08:48,875
lost to us earlier.

677
01:08:51,292 --> 01:08:53,208
He's all by himself.

678
01:08:53,292 --> 01:08:54,542
There are three of us.

679
01:08:54,958 --> 01:08:56,708
At least three different points of view.

680
01:08:57,208 --> 01:08:58,125
That's right.

681
01:08:58,208 --> 01:09:01,167
Three heads are better than one.

682
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:08,292
Take it.

683
01:09:09,792 --> 01:09:11,042
You keep it.

684
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:13,958
You have no objection, right, Fatty Meng?

685
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:18,083
No objection.

686
01:09:24,208 --> 01:09:25,958
We have to trust each other

687
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:31,542
if we want to survive.

688
01:09:35,583 --> 01:09:36,875
It's about time.

689
01:09:37,625 --> 01:09:39,375
<i>Fatty Meng, keep an eye on the card count.</i>

690
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:41,792
<i>When there are only two papers left,</i>

691
01:09:41,917 --> 01:09:43,208
<i>it will be our cue.</i>

692
01:09:44,417 --> 01:09:45,667
<i>We have two stars</i>

693
01:09:46,542 --> 01:09:47,500
<i>as backup.</i>

694
01:10:21,167 --> 01:10:22,417
Every time I asked you

695
01:10:23,375 --> 01:10:25,875
what happened on your eighth birthday,

696
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:28,208
you told me you forgot.

697
01:10:29,542 --> 01:10:30,917
All I can remember is

698
01:10:32,917 --> 01:10:34,583
Scottish Black Sheep.

699
01:10:35,208 --> 01:10:38,000
And scattered memories.

700
01:10:39,625 --> 01:10:40,833
There was someone whistling.

701
01:10:41,917 --> 01:10:43,000
Whistling?

702
01:10:44,792 --> 01:10:46,417
It terrifies me

703
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:50,208
whenever I think about it.

704
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:22,708
<i>I have fought the good fight.</i>

705
01:11:26,792 --> 01:11:29,625
<i>I have finished the race.</i>

706
01:11:29,708 --> 01:11:32,000
<i>I have kept the faith.</i>

707
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:33,417
<i>Since then</i>

708
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:35,458
<i>whenever I get emotional, I get crazy.</i>

709
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:37,667
<i>I can't get the clown out of my head.</i>

710
01:11:41,292 --> 01:11:42,292
To be honest,

711
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I can't tell if my memory

712
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:46,083
is real or not.

713
01:11:47,667 --> 01:11:48,542
So--

714
01:11:52,458 --> 01:11:54,667
Old man, we are running out of time.

715
01:11:55,083 --> 01:11:57,208
You still have so many cards left.

716
01:11:58,042 --> 01:12:00,417
You won't get out without my plan.

717
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:02,625
You need money for your son, right?

718
01:12:02,708 --> 01:12:03,667
If you don't make it...

719
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:10,333
-Let's go somewhere else.
-Okay.

720
01:12:10,417 --> 01:12:11,333
Come on.

721
01:12:21,792 --> 01:12:23,000
Something is wrong.

722
01:12:24,208 --> 01:12:25,792
You guys need to check it out.

723
01:12:29,083 --> 01:12:31,167
Papers haven't changed for a while.

724
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:32,833
Only scissors are decreasing.

725
01:12:32,917 --> 01:12:34,667
It's not the same proportion.

726
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:35,750
Did you see that?

727
01:12:36,083 --> 01:12:37,583
Scissors go down in pairs.

728
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:42,417
<i>Scissors are dropping fast.</i>

729
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:43,792
Too many tied games.

730
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:47,833
Each draw takes two scissors.

731
01:12:48,958 --> 01:12:50,708
Why are there so many draws
all of a sudden?

732
01:13:02,542 --> 01:13:03,958
<i>According to our theory,</i>

733
01:13:04,375 --> 01:13:06,500
<i>paper should be
the first card type to run out.</i>

734
01:13:07,042 --> 01:13:08,292
<i>We stocked up rocks,</i>

735
01:13:08,958 --> 01:13:10,958
<i>so rocks don't decrease.</i>

736
01:13:12,167 --> 01:13:14,375
<i>The consumption of the other two cards
should not be affected.</i>

737
01:13:15,042 --> 01:13:17,667
<i>But now scissors are decreasing fast</i>

738
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:19,458
<i>due to lots of draws.</i>

739
01:13:20,333 --> 01:13:22,417
<i>There is only one possibility.</i>

740
01:13:23,042 --> 01:13:23,917
<i>It could be</i>

741
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,417
<i>that someone put out the paper fuse.</i>

742
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:34,417
Damn.

743
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:39,167
Someone stocked up the cards like we did.

744
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,542
They want to buy out the remaining papers.

745
01:13:55,208 --> 01:13:57,667
Kai-si, what are we going to do?
We have to do something.

746
01:13:58,458 --> 01:14:00,000
There are only 46 scissors left.

747
01:14:00,375 --> 01:14:01,375
If we keep waiting,

748
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:04,000
the rocks we have will be useless.

749
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:08,708
We can't wait anymore.

750
01:14:10,917 --> 01:14:11,917
I have to play now.

751
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,708
Me too.

752
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:22,583
Okay.

753
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:23,750
Check.

754
01:15:23,375 --> 01:15:24,333
Hey.

755
01:15:25,417 --> 01:15:26,333
What's up?

756
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:27,750
I'm Luca.

757
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:29,750
I need 500,000.

758
01:15:30,375 --> 01:15:31,500
Those two guys behind him

759
01:15:31,708 --> 01:15:33,583
are the ones who won our stars.

760
01:15:40,625 --> 01:15:41,792
It seems that

761
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:43,500
we became prey.

762
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:03,625
Can you sell us your extra stars?

763
01:16:13,417 --> 01:16:14,500
How much?

764
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:20,958
So?

765
01:16:21,125 --> 01:16:22,125
How about this?

766
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:24,000
We'll borrow more money,

767
01:16:24,333 --> 01:16:26,042
and you sell me your three extra stars?

768
01:16:43,625 --> 01:16:44,917
Sell three to me,

769
01:16:45,375 --> 01:16:46,792
then I'll play three rounds with you.

770
01:16:56,833 --> 01:16:58,042
Finished.

771
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:05,583
Okay.

772
01:17:07,167 --> 01:17:08,083
One game

773
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,042
for three stars.

774
01:17:11,417 --> 01:17:13,083
Is this damn translation machine
not working?

775
01:17:13,167 --> 01:17:15,583
I told you I won't sell you three stars.

776
01:17:15,792 --> 01:17:17,208
I never intended to buy your stars.

777
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:20,792
What I want is to bet our three stars

778
01:17:21,042 --> 01:17:22,833
on your extra star.

779
01:17:23,292 --> 01:17:24,292
You are insane!

780
01:17:24,417 --> 01:17:25,750
Have you lost your mind?

781
01:17:27,458 --> 01:17:28,833
We don't have much time.

782
01:17:29,208 --> 01:17:30,500
We need six more stars.

783
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:31,917
Any other choices?

784
01:17:34,042 --> 01:17:35,042
I disagree.

785
01:17:36,208 --> 01:17:37,125
I agree.

786
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:40,583
If it weren't for you,

787
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,208
I would've already been conned
into the black room.

788
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:47,750
My life depends on you.

789
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:00,375
Two stars.

790
01:18:01,125 --> 01:18:02,208
Add mine.

791
01:18:04,958 --> 01:18:05,875
Three.

792
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:07,583
Talk to them.

793
01:18:07,958 --> 01:18:10,042
You've got to try no matter what.

794
01:18:14,208 --> 01:18:15,167
What do you say?

795
01:19:50,583 --> 01:19:51,542
Referee.

796
01:19:51,667 --> 01:19:53,917
The game can't be interrupted
after you put down the card, right?

797
01:20:06,167 --> 01:20:07,458
He doesn't feel right.

798
01:20:10,917 --> 01:20:12,542
It proves that my deduction

799
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,625
might be right.

800
01:20:15,125 --> 01:20:18,083
<i>When he took a card out of his pocket,</i>

801
01:20:18,375 --> 01:20:20,042
<i>I suddenly realized</i>

802
01:20:20,208 --> 01:20:21,708
<i>that the total number of cards they hold</i>

803
01:20:22,958 --> 01:20:24,292
<i>must be an odd number.</i>

804
01:20:25,208 --> 01:20:26,500
<i>If it's even,</i>

805
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:31,542
<i>they could use up all the cards
by deliberating ties between them.</i>

806
01:20:33,292 --> 01:20:35,000
<i>But if it's an odd number,</i>

807
01:20:35,292 --> 01:20:38,542
<i>they need one more opponent
to use this extra card</i>

808
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:39,875
<i>before they are safe.</i>

809
01:20:52,583 --> 01:20:54,042
When I stocked a certain type of cards,

810
01:20:54,125 --> 01:20:56,417
I also paid attention to the amount
of other two types of cards.

811
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,750
I need to make sure
that the total remains an even number,

812
01:20:58,833 --> 01:21:00,167
so I can get rid of them with draws.

813
01:21:00,292 --> 01:21:01,333
<i>Two scissors.</i>

814
01:21:01,458 --> 01:21:02,458
<i>Four papers.</i>

815
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,042
<i>It's perfect.</i>

816
01:21:04,583 --> 01:21:06,167
But for the total number
of cards I stocked,

817
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:08,333
even or odd doesn't matter.

818
01:21:08,458 --> 01:21:10,958
Because I don't know how many games
I have to play in the future.

819
01:21:11,042 --> 01:21:13,500
<i>It might become an odd number easily.</i>

820
01:21:13,917 --> 01:21:16,375
<i>For example, suppose you have 30 papers,</i>

821
01:21:16,458 --> 01:21:18,042
<i>and it becomes odd after three games,</i>

822
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:20,417
<i>you'll need a fourth opponent</i>

823
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:21,875
<i>to become an even number again.</i>

824
01:21:21,958 --> 01:21:23,667
<i>When you've played four games
and want to stop,</i>

825
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:25,375
<i>but someone still wants to play with you,</i>

826
01:21:25,458 --> 01:21:28,208
<i>and you have a good chance of winning,
you'll play again.</i>

827
01:21:28,292 --> 01:21:30,250
<i>The total of cards
will be an odd number again.</i>

828
01:21:30,417 --> 01:21:32,500
<i>Surely you can use other types of cards</i>

829
01:21:32,667 --> 01:21:35,375
<i>allocating stars internally
to make papers even,</i>

830
01:21:35,542 --> 01:21:37,083
<i>and other types odd.</i>

831
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:39,083
<i>But for you,</i>

832
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:40,875
<i>you'd rather keep papers odd,</i>

833
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:43,625
<i>especially when you're competing
with someone who stocked up rocks.</i>

834
01:21:43,875 --> 01:21:46,458
<i>Surely you'll use the card
with better chances.</i>

835
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:52,167
So, I guess this extra card you have
is a paper you stocked.

836
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:55,000
Paper. And mine is scissors.

837
01:22:33,458 --> 01:22:34,375
Motherfucker!

838
01:22:34,625 --> 01:22:36,583
If you weren't crazy about money
and kept pushing me.

839
01:22:36,667 --> 01:22:37,792
This wouldn't have happened.

840
01:22:40,458 --> 01:22:41,292
Hey!

841
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:44,250
Sell me your extra cards.

842
01:22:55,542 --> 01:22:58,917
You could've asked anyone for help
to get rid of this annoying card.

843
01:23:00,625 --> 01:23:01,917
But you're too arrogant.

844
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,958
You just wanted to gloat.

845
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:06,833
That's why you lost.

846
01:23:13,375 --> 01:23:14,458
You really think so?

847
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:17,875
Look over there.

848
01:23:19,458 --> 01:23:21,708
They sold all the cards to me.

849
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,750
Bastard! How dare you betray me!

850
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:30,750
Let's work together.

851
01:23:41,542 --> 01:23:43,208
You should give me 100,000 dollars

852
01:23:43,583 --> 01:23:45,250
and I'll take all your cards.

853
01:23:59,792 --> 01:24:03,500
Then I'll tell all of them
what cards you have.

854
01:24:03,792 --> 01:24:06,625
Whoever buys, becomes an easy target.

855
01:24:11,333 --> 01:24:12,708
They seem to be

856
01:24:13,583 --> 01:24:14,917
eight papers

857
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:17,083
and two scissors.

858
01:24:18,875 --> 01:24:20,208
Your friends told me.

859
01:24:25,875 --> 01:24:26,958
Nice working with you.

860
01:24:27,375 --> 01:24:28,458
Screw you.

861
01:24:28,917 --> 01:24:30,250
Go to hell!

862
01:24:44,625 --> 01:24:47,208
Stocking up papers after rocks.

863
01:24:47,625 --> 01:24:48,833
Impressive.

864
01:24:49,542 --> 01:24:52,208
Too bad. It's not necessarily safe.

865
01:24:53,917 --> 01:24:55,875
Those who did this before,

866
01:24:58,375 --> 01:24:59,375
all failed.

867
01:25:02,208 --> 01:25:03,500
I'll give you a star.

868
01:25:04,542 --> 01:25:06,958
Let your stupid friends have the cards

869
01:25:07,375 --> 01:25:09,750
and you can get out with this star safely.

870
01:25:14,583 --> 01:25:15,792
All right. Give it to me.

871
01:25:17,792 --> 01:25:19,375
You have to give me five cards.

872
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:23,042
Three rocks, one scissors, and one paper.

873
01:25:25,708 --> 01:25:27,625
I knew you are up to no good.

874
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:29,958
Rest assured.

875
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:33,292
These five cards
will be used against others.

876
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,042
Deal?

877
01:25:40,625 --> 01:25:42,958
I will never abandon my friends.

878
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:49,458
Care to know what comes after elimination?

879
01:25:51,625 --> 01:25:53,583
<i>The first time I was on board,</i>

880
01:25:54,292 --> 01:25:56,083
<i>I was on the brink of elimination.</i>

881
01:25:57,042 --> 01:25:59,167
<i>Then someone had a seizure.</i>

882
01:25:59,917 --> 01:26:01,958
<i>I escaped from the scene in chaos.</i>

883
01:26:02,583 --> 01:26:04,042
<i>That time,</i>

884
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,667
<i>only five of us got off the ship.</i>

885
01:26:07,958 --> 01:26:12,000
<i>One of them told me that
there's a medical lab on the bottom deck.</i>

886
01:26:12,458 --> 01:26:14,833
<i>They were doing genetic tests there.</i>

887
01:26:17,042 --> 01:26:18,958
I swear on my life.

888
01:26:20,333 --> 01:26:22,250
I'm not lying this time.

889
01:26:26,958 --> 01:26:28,167
If you can't get off the ship,

890
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:31,333
you'll wish you were dead.

891
01:26:55,792 --> 01:26:56,792
Remember!

892
01:26:57,458 --> 01:26:59,708
Loyalty means nothing
in this animal world!

893
01:27:01,125 --> 01:27:01,958
Idiot.

894
01:27:05,250 --> 01:27:06,500
We have 69 cards in total.

895
01:27:07,042 --> 01:27:10,542
We have 30 rocks, 34 papers
and 5 scissors.

896
01:27:13,083 --> 01:27:14,667
Besides us three,

897
01:27:15,083 --> 01:27:16,458
there are 38 people on this floor.

898
01:27:16,542 --> 01:27:18,917
And 22 of them have no cards left.

899
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,750
They're waiting to buy stars.

900
01:27:21,208 --> 01:27:23,875
Now there are only 16 people
that can still play.

901
01:27:28,125 --> 01:27:29,333
<i>Besides the cards we have,</i>

902
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:33,583
<i>there are nine rocks, nine scissors
and five papers left.</i>

903
01:27:35,042 --> 01:27:36,292
We'll make our move

904
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,208
when two more papers are recycled.

905
01:27:51,542 --> 01:27:52,417
Let's go.

906
01:28:06,333 --> 01:28:07,583
May I have your attention?

907
01:28:12,542 --> 01:28:14,167
Please adjust your headsets to my channel.

908
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:18,917
Not many cards are left among us.

909
01:28:20,167 --> 01:28:22,792
Your opponent probably

910
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:25,875
already knows your cards.

911
01:28:27,042 --> 01:28:30,417
Therefore, I propose
we gather all the cards

912
01:28:31,708 --> 01:28:33,000
and reshuffle them!

913
01:28:35,292 --> 01:28:37,833
This will expose our plan.

914
01:28:44,542 --> 01:28:46,958
Some of you might think I'm bluffing.

915
01:28:48,792 --> 01:28:49,875
All right then.

916
01:28:50,667 --> 01:28:52,292
Let me prove it to you.

917
01:28:54,417 --> 01:28:56,250
No. 57, the man wearing a hat over there,

918
01:28:56,375 --> 01:28:58,167
you have a scissors card left.

919
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:00,625
No. 7, the man with long hair,

920
01:29:00,708 --> 01:29:02,542
you have a rock left.

921
01:29:02,625 --> 01:29:03,708
The man with blonde hair,

922
01:29:03,792 --> 01:29:04,917
you have a paper.

923
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:05,958
Am I right?

924
01:29:06,042 --> 01:29:06,958
Nonsense.

925
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:08,625
My card isn't scissors.

926
01:29:08,958 --> 01:29:10,333
Stop lying to yourself.

927
01:29:10,417 --> 01:29:12,917
Many of you bought cards from others.

928
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,417
Those who sold the cards to you,

929
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:15,583
without any hesitation,

930
01:29:15,667 --> 01:29:17,708
would sell the information to others.

931
01:29:17,833 --> 01:29:19,625
Many bought information from them,

932
01:29:19,875 --> 01:29:21,500
so all of you

933
01:29:21,583 --> 01:29:22,750
are easy targets.

934
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:28,083
Understand?

935
01:29:30,333 --> 01:29:32,250
-I'm in.
-Me too.

936
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:33,250
-Me too.
-Count me in.

937
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:34,583
-Me too.
-I'm in.

938
01:29:34,667 --> 01:29:35,958
-Me too.
-Count me in.

939
01:29:36,958 --> 01:29:39,583
-Me too.
-Count me in.

940
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:41,750
-I'm in.
-I'm in.

941
01:30:04,667 --> 01:30:06,042
How come there are only a dozen cards?

942
01:30:06,333 --> 01:30:08,333
The board shows there's more.

943
01:30:09,375 --> 01:30:11,875
Some of you must be stocking cards.

944
01:30:12,625 --> 01:30:14,042
That's why they're afraid

945
01:30:14,292 --> 01:30:16,375
and don't want to reshuffle cards.

946
01:30:17,083 --> 01:30:17,958
How about this?

947
01:30:18,792 --> 01:30:20,125
After reshuffle,

948
01:30:20,792 --> 01:30:24,250
we only play among ourselves.

949
01:30:25,667 --> 01:30:27,292
This will lower the risks.

950
01:30:39,542 --> 01:30:40,583
We're in too.

951
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,083
Sure.

952
01:30:43,667 --> 01:30:45,000
How many cards do you have?

953
01:30:53,167 --> 01:30:54,917
Three scissors are missing.

954
01:30:57,125 --> 01:30:58,000
Hey!

955
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:00,625
You are offered another chance.

956
01:31:01,583 --> 01:31:03,000
If you don't join us now,

957
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:06,542
you'll be stuck with your cards.

958
01:31:08,333 --> 01:31:09,292
No more waiting.

959
01:31:50,125 --> 01:31:51,542
Hurry up and play.

960
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:03,458
You asked for it!

961
01:32:41,583 --> 01:32:42,708
There are 32 rocks.

962
01:32:44,042 --> 01:32:45,042
Three scissors.

963
01:32:45,250 --> 01:32:46,792
And 34 papers.

964
01:32:47,583 --> 01:32:49,500
We have all the papers.

965
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:51,708
Besides the cards we have,

966
01:32:52,167 --> 01:32:53,875
there are two rocks and five scissors.

967
01:32:55,125 --> 01:32:56,625
There aren't that many scissors left.

968
01:33:00,292 --> 01:33:01,417
No time for that.

969
01:33:01,792 --> 01:33:02,875
Play the rocks.

970
01:33:02,958 --> 01:33:04,292
The worst case is a draw.

971
01:33:05,667 --> 01:33:09,542
Don't touch me.

972
01:33:09,625 --> 01:33:12,625
Or I'll show you how bad I can be.

973
01:33:12,708 --> 01:33:15,500
-Don't touch me.
-Losing will only cost you a star,

974
01:33:15,708 --> 01:33:17,958
which you can buy afterward.

975
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:20,708
But if you don't use this card,

976
01:33:21,458 --> 01:33:22,750
you are dead for sure.

977
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:25,417
Don't push him if he doesn't want to play.

978
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:27,208
I'll play with you.

979
01:33:32,792 --> 01:33:33,792
Play with me.

980
01:33:34,292 --> 01:33:35,917
I'll give you two stars if you win.

981
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:38,500
If you lose, you can give me just one.

982
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:39,792
How about that?

983
01:33:41,458 --> 01:33:42,667
Are you stupid?

984
01:33:43,417 --> 01:33:45,250
He has 69 cards in his hand.

985
01:33:45,833 --> 01:33:48,250
Surely he can figure out
what card will win.

986
01:33:55,708 --> 01:33:57,125
I've told you.

987
01:33:58,333 --> 01:34:00,250
Stocking cards won't work.

988
01:34:01,625 --> 01:34:03,458
How do you know that I won't lose?

989
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:05,792
My guess.

990
01:34:07,583 --> 01:34:10,542
Why else would you bet two stars for one?

991
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:12,250
Are you sure?

992
01:34:13,083 --> 01:34:14,083
Yes.

993
01:34:15,083 --> 01:34:18,167
That means you know I have 34 papers.

994
01:34:19,417 --> 01:34:21,875
This is the only way I'll win this game.

995
01:34:22,542 --> 01:34:23,875
What are you implying?

996
01:34:24,083 --> 01:34:26,000
Since you're sure
that I have all the papers,

997
01:34:26,083 --> 01:34:29,458
you must know a rock will guarantee a win.

998
01:34:29,708 --> 01:34:30,583
Right?

999
01:34:31,667 --> 01:34:33,875
He defeated my scissors
with a rock just now.

1000
01:34:33,958 --> 01:34:36,125
-That was a coincidence.
-That was not a coincidence.

1001
01:34:37,125 --> 01:34:37,958
This man,

1002
01:34:38,333 --> 01:34:42,250
at the beginning of the games,
won two stars of mine by cheating.

1003
01:34:42,333 --> 01:34:44,250
Then he tried to trade stars for my cards.

1004
01:34:44,542 --> 01:34:45,958
He has targeted his prey.

1005
01:34:46,042 --> 01:34:48,917
He won't lose
as long as he has the right cards.

1006
01:34:49,292 --> 01:34:50,667
When I refused him,

1007
01:34:51,083 --> 01:34:52,625
he suggested reshuffling the cards.

1008
01:34:52,792 --> 01:34:53,917
If I'm right,

1009
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,125
he cheated again
while reshuffling the cards.

1010
01:34:56,375 --> 01:34:57,875
<i> He gave me all the papers</i>

1011
01:34:57,958 --> 01:34:59,958
<i>and saved the rocks to himself.</i>

1012
01:35:00,125 --> 01:35:01,750
<i>He gave the scissors to his prey.</i>

1013
01:35:02,042 --> 01:35:04,083
<i>Those who has only one card left.</i>

1014
01:35:11,833 --> 01:35:13,417
Have some common sense.

1015
01:35:15,292 --> 01:35:16,833
I dealt the cards face down.

1016
01:35:17,542 --> 01:35:18,833
You all saw that, right?

1017
01:35:19,083 --> 01:35:21,958
Even if I could save rocks for myself,

1018
01:35:22,708 --> 01:35:25,625
there's no way for me to know
who has scissors.

1019
01:35:26,042 --> 01:35:28,083
What if you marked the cards?

1020
01:35:37,542 --> 01:35:39,125
Three scissors are missing.

1021
01:35:43,042 --> 01:35:44,042
No more waiting.

1022
01:35:46,958 --> 01:35:48,917
You have scissors, right?

1023
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:57,292
Zheng Kai-si.

1024
01:35:59,333 --> 01:36:00,750
What the hell are you doing?

1025
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:04,500
It's like we are playing
with open cards now.

1026
01:36:06,167 --> 01:36:07,750
Nobody is willing to play anymore.

1027
01:36:08,917 --> 01:36:10,667
Then I'll play it blindly.

1028
01:36:13,125 --> 01:36:15,625
<i>Now, I'm the only one
who has all the three kinds of cards.</i>

1029
01:36:15,958 --> 01:36:19,708
<i>I'll mix up the order
and put them on the table face down.</i>

1030
01:36:19,958 --> 01:36:22,792
<i>You can choose the card I play.</i>

1031
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:25,375
<i>I won't touch them.</i>

1032
01:36:26,042 --> 01:36:27,667
<i>Once the result is revealed,</i>

1033
01:36:27,958 --> 01:36:30,917
<i>you can flip the other two to confirm.</i>

1034
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,125
<i>It's fair enough.</i>

1035
01:37:03,333 --> 01:37:04,208
Next.

1036
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:23,125
It all depends on luck.
Is it to our disadvantage?

1037
01:37:23,333 --> 01:37:24,333
Next.

1038
01:37:30,250 --> 01:37:32,750
It's paper.

1039
01:37:35,917 --> 01:37:37,458
Do you want to get off the ship?

1040
01:37:37,542 --> 01:37:39,458
I won!

1041
01:37:39,583 --> 01:37:41,333
Who didn't participate in the reshuffling?

1042
01:37:42,583 --> 01:37:44,333
We have five minutes left.

1043
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:45,958
It's almost showtime.

1044
01:37:46,583 --> 01:37:47,750
Five minutes!

1045
01:37:48,625 --> 01:37:50,458
It's not going to help
if you hide in the crowd.

1046
01:37:52,625 --> 01:37:54,208
Step out and play the game with me.

1047
01:37:59,167 --> 01:38:00,917
If that person really wants to play,

1048
01:38:01,833 --> 01:38:03,333
he'll play with me.

1049
01:38:04,625 --> 01:38:06,292
At least he still has a chance.

1050
01:38:10,208 --> 01:38:11,667
I can give you stars

1051
01:38:12,542 --> 01:38:14,083
and make sure you get off safely!

1052
01:38:14,958 --> 01:38:17,333
-Just step out and play with me!
-Stop yelling.

1053
01:38:18,417 --> 01:38:19,875
There's no such person.

1054
01:38:23,708 --> 01:38:26,583
Remember the guy
who flushed his cards down the toilet?

1055
01:38:28,333 --> 01:38:29,917
<i>Three scissors are missing.</i>

1056
01:38:30,833 --> 01:38:33,208
<i>And now, it seems like</i>

1057
01:38:34,083 --> 01:38:35,917
<i>he flushed three scissors.</i>

1058
01:38:37,875 --> 01:38:38,792
<i>What a shame.</i>

1059
01:38:39,667 --> 01:38:43,250
<i>The board only counts recycled cards.</i>

1060
01:38:43,917 --> 01:38:44,917
<i>You've been fooled.</i>

1061
01:38:45,333 --> 01:38:47,667
<i>I found that out
when you were reshuffling.</i>

1062
01:38:47,792 --> 01:38:49,667
<i>There aren't that many scissors left.</i>

1063
01:38:50,167 --> 01:38:52,292
<i>Winning or losing doesn't matter
in a blind game.</i>

1064
01:38:52,625 --> 01:38:56,625
<i>The point is to consume the others' cards.</i>

1065
01:38:58,458 --> 01:39:01,000
Now, I'm the only one who has the cards.

1066
01:39:02,458 --> 01:39:04,000
If you've made up your mind,

1067
01:39:04,625 --> 01:39:06,083
find me at Table Six.

1068
01:39:08,125 --> 01:39:09,375
I'll be there waiting for you.

1069
01:39:17,917 --> 01:39:19,917
I'm safe. Goodbye.

1070
01:39:38,958 --> 01:39:40,208
I bet five stars.

1071
01:39:41,542 --> 01:39:42,667
Three.

1072
01:39:43,917 --> 01:39:46,208
You don't have the leverage
to bargain with me.

1073
01:39:48,167 --> 01:39:49,958
I don't mind anyway.

1074
01:39:50,458 --> 01:39:53,000
I'll just drag the three of you
down with me.

1075
01:39:54,417 --> 01:39:55,417
Totally worth it.

1076
01:39:56,542 --> 01:39:58,625
You are so familiar
with the cards we have,

1077
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:01,208
then why don't you do the math?

1078
01:40:06,208 --> 01:40:08,708
We have 69 cards in total.

1079
01:40:09,083 --> 01:40:10,250
In the blind game just now,

1080
01:40:10,333 --> 01:40:12,458
we used one scissors,
one rock and one paper.

1081
01:40:13,083 --> 01:40:15,708
So now we have 66 cards.

1082
01:40:16,333 --> 01:40:17,458
An even number.

1083
01:40:18,458 --> 01:40:19,917
If you don't play with us,

1084
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,125
we could consume all the cards
through draws among us.

1085
01:40:24,208 --> 01:40:26,583
You'll be the only one
who'd end up in the black room.

1086
01:40:26,708 --> 01:40:27,667
As for us,

1087
01:40:28,292 --> 01:40:29,917
we can still buy stars.

1088
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,500
But we may get into trouble

1089
01:40:32,792 --> 01:40:34,500
if you play with us.

1090
01:40:35,292 --> 01:40:36,792
If I win you with a paper,

1091
01:40:37,042 --> 01:40:39,792
we'll have 65 cards left.

1092
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:45,042
There will be an extra card,

1093
01:40:45,833 --> 01:40:47,958
which will never be played.

1094
01:40:49,542 --> 01:40:52,250
One of us will go to the black room.

1095
01:40:52,708 --> 01:40:54,083
-Dude.
-Don't worry.

1096
01:40:54,833 --> 01:40:55,875
I will go.

1097
01:40:57,542 --> 01:40:58,667
Big Shrimp.

1098
01:40:59,417 --> 01:41:02,375
You said there's one last chance
of redemption.

1099
01:41:02,875 --> 01:41:04,708
It could just be hearsay.

1100
01:41:04,792 --> 01:41:05,625
What if--

1101
01:41:07,167 --> 01:41:08,708
This whole time,

1102
01:41:09,083 --> 01:41:11,750
no decisions were risk-free for us.

1103
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:40,875
Apologize...

1104
01:41:44,667 --> 01:41:46,500
to all the people you have cheated.

1105
01:41:53,083 --> 01:41:54,167
I'm sorry.

1106
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:56,083
Slap yourself hard.

1107
01:41:59,167 --> 01:42:00,833
-We don't have time, Zheng Kai-si.
-Hurry up!

1108
01:42:06,917 --> 01:42:08,625
Too soft. Do it again.

1109
01:42:11,625 --> 01:42:13,125
Not hard enough. Do it again.

1110
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,583
Harder! Again!

1111
01:43:24,833 --> 01:43:26,125
Just get me out.

1112
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:16,417
Hey.

1113
01:44:18,417 --> 01:44:20,458
Do you still have the chance to get out?

1114
01:44:22,958 --> 01:44:24,125
Come here and sit.

1115
01:44:36,542 --> 01:44:38,083
This seat is for the VIP.

1116
01:44:39,208 --> 01:44:40,833
It's easy to point you out later.

1117
01:44:54,125 --> 01:44:55,042
Young man!

1118
01:44:55,417 --> 01:44:57,333
Did you see a man

1119
01:44:57,708 --> 01:44:59,208
in a white suit outside?

1120
01:45:02,125 --> 01:45:03,500
You mean No. 29?

1121
01:45:05,042 --> 01:45:06,000
Yes.

1122
01:45:06,333 --> 01:45:08,208
That's him. No. 29.

1123
01:45:09,125 --> 01:45:10,542
He should be upstairs long ago.

1124
01:45:12,958 --> 01:45:14,833
Am I right, old man?

1125
01:45:15,875 --> 01:45:17,708
You must have been tricked.

1126
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:20,417
What happened?

1127
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,042
He told me

1128
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:24,833
in here.

1129
01:45:25,458 --> 01:45:29,583
<i>I can see their cards from behind.</i>

1130
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:31,708
<i>He asked me to come in
to give him signals.</i>

1131
01:45:31,917 --> 01:45:34,542
<i>When he has enough stars,
he would get me out of here.</i>

1132
01:45:34,958 --> 01:45:35,875
<i>But</i>

1133
01:45:36,208 --> 01:45:38,167
<i>he went to the bathroom halfway.</i>

1134
01:45:38,625 --> 01:45:39,917
<i>I can't find him anymore.</i>

1135
01:45:41,333 --> 01:45:42,625
You helped him cheat?

1136
01:45:43,750 --> 01:45:45,375
Why are you so surprised?

1137
01:45:46,458 --> 01:45:50,500
My partner and I
played this trick several times.

1138
01:45:52,458 --> 01:45:53,875
Those over there

1139
01:45:54,875 --> 01:45:56,708
were sent here by us.

1140
01:45:57,625 --> 01:45:59,125
That man said

1141
01:45:59,208 --> 01:46:02,250
that cheating is allowed.

1142
01:46:02,833 --> 01:46:03,708
So...

1143
01:46:04,417 --> 01:46:06,167
So, I agreed to his plan.

1144
01:46:06,875 --> 01:46:09,083
But you came in with empty hands.

1145
01:46:15,333 --> 01:46:17,458
So did you.

1146
01:46:20,125 --> 01:46:21,792
You might not make it.

1147
01:46:23,208 --> 01:46:24,500
What do you mean?

1148
01:46:26,375 --> 01:46:27,375
You mean...

1149
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:05,875
I wonder if I could skip the trade

1150
01:47:06,417 --> 01:47:08,875
and use my extra stars to save my friend.

1151
01:47:15,792 --> 01:47:16,792
Did you see that?

1152
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:18,583
He is my childhood pal.

1153
01:47:28,125 --> 01:47:29,708
-What the hell?
-Move!

1154
01:47:32,542 --> 01:47:34,208
This is for saving my friend.

1155
01:47:35,125 --> 01:47:36,917
-For 200,000!
-Shut up!

1156
01:47:37,250 --> 01:47:38,250
Shut up!

1157
01:47:38,667 --> 01:47:40,000
We have one extra star anyway.

1158
01:47:40,083 --> 01:47:41,208
Just sell it.

1159
01:47:41,292 --> 01:47:42,708
Let's rescue him first.

1160
01:47:44,292 --> 01:47:46,000
We can't get through without selling.

1161
01:47:50,125 --> 01:47:50,958
Fine.

1162
01:47:51,125 --> 01:47:52,500
It's 500,000 for one star, any buyers?

1163
01:47:52,583 --> 01:47:55,083
-Me!
-Sell it to me!

1164
01:47:58,333 --> 01:47:59,958
It's not for sale. It's for my friend!

1165
01:48:01,917 --> 01:48:03,833
-Big Shrimp.
-I want to save him.

1166
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:04,917
No. 72.

1167
01:48:15,250 --> 01:48:16,375
I disagree.

1168
01:48:17,583 --> 01:48:18,750
I don't want to save him.

1169
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,083
Three stars

1170
01:48:23,167 --> 01:48:25,583
worth at least 1.5 million dollars.

1171
01:48:25,750 --> 01:48:28,333
It can get even higher later on.

1172
01:48:29,708 --> 01:48:30,917
Meng Guo-xiang.

1173
01:48:32,042 --> 01:48:33,833
You're despicable.

1174
01:48:35,042 --> 01:48:36,125
I made up my name.

1175
01:48:36,833 --> 01:48:37,750
The wallet?

1176
01:48:38,167 --> 01:48:39,208
I stole it.

1177
01:48:39,292 --> 01:48:40,292
I don't have a daughter.

1178
01:48:41,417 --> 01:48:43,417
I have nothing except these three stars.

1179
01:48:44,083 --> 01:48:46,000
I don't know why you got on board,

1180
01:48:46,333 --> 01:48:48,417
but don't you think that these three stars

1181
01:48:48,708 --> 01:48:50,958
are our only hope?

1182
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:53,833
Do you really want to give up
a chance like this?

1183
01:48:54,333 --> 01:48:55,458
Big Shrimp!

1184
01:48:56,875 --> 01:48:58,583
Now I see who you really are.

1185
01:48:59,542 --> 01:49:01,125
If you listen to me right now...

1186
01:49:01,333 --> 01:49:02,708
Big Shrimp, don't listen to him!

1187
01:49:02,792 --> 01:49:04,000
Don't save him.

1188
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:06,083
We can get off the ship with a fortune.

1189
01:49:06,208 --> 01:49:08,417
At least ten million.

1190
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,542
Ten million.

1191
01:49:11,125 --> 01:49:12,208
If you rescue him,

1192
01:49:12,417 --> 01:49:14,083
we could leave here alive.

1193
01:49:14,167 --> 01:49:16,042
But don't forget that the interest

1194
01:49:16,125 --> 01:49:17,917
on the 500,000 we borrowed
rolls by the minute.

1195
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,167
Do you have any idea
how big that number is?

1196
01:49:20,667 --> 01:49:21,917
Astronomical.

1197
01:49:23,208 --> 01:49:24,917
Do the math.

1198
01:49:26,167 --> 01:49:27,583
Who can pay it off?

1199
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:30,917
Who can?

1200
01:49:32,417 --> 01:49:33,625
If you are in,

1201
01:49:34,083 --> 01:49:35,167
I'll give you a share.

1202
01:49:35,750 --> 01:49:37,083
If you want to rescue him,

1203
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:39,958
you can have this money.

1204
01:49:42,042 --> 01:49:43,417
Figure out how to save him on your own.

1205
01:49:45,542 --> 01:49:46,417
Big Shrimp.

1206
01:49:46,667 --> 01:49:49,375
Go get the stars back!
My life depends on it!

1207
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:50,583
Stars for sale!

1208
01:49:50,792 --> 01:49:51,792
Who wants to buy?

1209
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,542
Follow me if you want to buy it.

1210
01:49:54,708 --> 01:49:55,708
Big Shrimp!

1211
01:49:57,625 --> 01:49:58,667
Big Shrimp!

1212
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,042
Big Shrimp!

1213
01:50:01,625 --> 01:50:02,708
Big Shrimp!

1214
01:50:04,917 --> 01:50:05,875
Big Shrimp!

1215
01:50:07,292 --> 01:50:08,500
Big Shrimp.

1216
01:50:11,125 --> 01:50:12,667
People die for wealth.

1217
01:50:14,250 --> 01:50:15,583
It's the human nature.

1218
01:50:24,625 --> 01:50:25,958
I'm sorry, buddy.

1219
01:50:27,667 --> 01:50:29,000
From this day on,

1220
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:32,167
your mom

1221
01:50:33,458 --> 01:50:34,667
is my mom.

1222
01:50:35,375 --> 01:50:36,542
I'll take care of her for you.

1223
01:50:40,208 --> 01:50:41,208
Big Shrimp!

1224
01:50:41,875 --> 01:50:42,708
Li Jun!

1225
01:50:43,458 --> 01:50:44,333
Li Jun!

1226
01:50:52,042 --> 01:50:53,917
Coming in with empty hands,

1227
01:50:54,542 --> 01:50:57,250
you can't even trust your blood brother.

1228
01:50:59,458 --> 01:51:02,125
You should've brought something valuable.

1229
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,083
Otherwise,

1230
01:51:06,333 --> 01:51:08,375
why would they redeem you?

1231
01:51:10,208 --> 01:51:12,083
You'll die here sooner or later

1232
01:51:13,375 --> 01:51:15,542
if you're so naive.

1233
01:51:16,792 --> 01:51:18,917
In this animal world,

1234
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:22,125
there's only profit, no emotions.

1235
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:24,792
<i>There's a medical lab on the bottom deck.</i>

1236
01:51:24,875 --> 01:51:26,708
<i>They were doing genetic tests there.</i>

1237
01:51:27,208 --> 01:51:29,250
<i>And we'll pay the debt as lab rats.</i>

1238
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:31,833
<i>If you can't get off the ship,
you'll wish you were dead.</i>

1239
01:51:31,917 --> 01:51:34,083
<i>People die for wealth.
It's the human nature.</i>

1240
01:51:34,417 --> 01:51:36,917
<i>You can't even trust your blood brother.</i>

1241
01:52:02,958 --> 01:52:03,875
Young man.

1242
01:52:05,125 --> 01:52:06,208
Are you all right?

1243
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:17,333
Three stars are worth
at least 1.5 million.

1244
01:52:18,458 --> 01:52:19,750
It's 10,000 dollars per stack.

1245
01:52:20,667 --> 01:52:23,250
Thus, 1.5 million
requires at least three bags like so.

1246
01:52:24,958 --> 01:52:26,583
The money in Scar Face's bag

1247
01:52:26,792 --> 01:52:28,417
can only buy one star.

1248
01:52:29,292 --> 01:52:32,083
But they'll pay triple to get him out.

1249
01:52:33,042 --> 01:52:34,375
According to his theory,

1250
01:52:34,833 --> 01:52:37,375
he must be worth much more.

1251
01:52:38,708 --> 01:52:40,458
Therefore, I'm sure

1252
01:52:40,958 --> 01:52:43,083
he must carry something valuable.

1253
01:52:43,875 --> 01:52:48,000
<i>My partner and I
played this trick several times.</i>

1254
01:52:48,083 --> 01:52:49,792
<i>It's not the first time
they've been on board.</i>

1255
01:52:50,792 --> 01:52:53,917
<i>They must know
how to bring valuables up here</i>

1256
01:52:54,708 --> 01:52:56,250
<i>and take it to the black room.</i>

1257
01:52:56,750 --> 01:53:00,083
<i>Tight bandage is bad
for discharging fluids.</i>

1258
01:53:01,208 --> 01:53:02,917
It limits new flesh to grow.

1259
01:53:03,750 --> 01:53:06,250
Airtight environment
will form an anaerobic zone,

1260
01:53:07,458 --> 01:53:09,292
which breeds anaerobes,

1261
01:53:09,833 --> 01:53:11,333
causing tetanus eventually.

1262
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,250
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

1263
01:53:14,792 --> 01:53:16,417
My friend recited this every day

1264
01:53:17,375 --> 01:53:18,958
when she was preparing for her exam.

1265
01:53:20,542 --> 01:53:21,458
No.

1266
01:53:21,958 --> 01:53:23,167
To be more accurate,

1267
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:25,083
she is my girlfriend.

1268
01:53:25,458 --> 01:53:26,542
Show me the stuff.

1269
01:53:29,583 --> 01:53:30,542
Where's the bandage?

1270
01:53:46,583 --> 01:53:49,208
-This is all we have.
-Redeem him.

1271
01:53:49,542 --> 01:53:50,375
Him.

1272
01:53:57,250 --> 01:53:58,333
Young man.

1273
01:53:58,917 --> 01:53:59,750
Young man.

1274
01:54:00,208 --> 01:54:01,167
Young man!

1275
01:54:03,292 --> 01:54:04,458
Please.

1276
01:54:05,042 --> 01:54:07,167
Send a message to my son.

1277
01:54:08,042 --> 01:54:09,375
Tell him to change the medications

1278
01:54:09,875 --> 01:54:11,500
to cheaper ones

1279
01:54:12,167 --> 01:54:14,375
so he will survive a few more months.

1280
01:54:16,292 --> 01:54:18,042
And please tell him

1281
01:54:19,458 --> 01:54:20,833
that I've tried my best.

1282
01:54:28,167 --> 01:54:29,875
Just a call will do.

1283
01:54:30,750 --> 01:54:33,333
It's 17310511913.

1284
01:54:34,917 --> 01:54:37,042
Young man, please!

1285
01:54:37,625 --> 01:54:39,458
Please!

1286
01:54:41,583 --> 01:54:43,750
<i>-I have fought</i>
<i>-I have fought</i>

1287
01:54:43,833 --> 01:54:46,083
<i>-the good fight.</i>
<i>-the good fight.</i>

1288
01:54:46,708 --> 01:54:48,958

<i>-I have kept the faith.</i>

1291
01:54:58,125 --> 01:54:59,167
<i>Betrayal.</i>

1292
01:54:59,625 --> 01:55:00,583
<i>Fight.</i>

1293
01:55:01,333 --> 01:55:02,750
<i>No bottom line.</i>

1294
01:55:03,667 --> 01:55:06,042
<i>These things tried to turn me
into an animal.</i>

1295
01:55:08,292 --> 01:55:09,250
<i>No way.</i>

1296
01:55:11,125 --> 01:55:15,000
<i>I'd rather be a clown
who fights for himself his whole life</i>

1297
01:55:15,167 --> 01:55:18,292
<i>than become a group of scums like you.</i>

1298
01:55:19,792 --> 01:55:21,375
<i>The game is yours.</i>

1299
01:55:22,625 --> 01:55:23,750
<i>But the rules</i>

1300
01:55:23,833 --> 01:55:25,542
<i>will be set by me.</i>

1301
01:55:47,625 --> 01:55:49,542
<i>To hell with the Animal World.</i>

1302
01:55:49,750 --> 01:55:50,750
<i>I</i>

1303
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:52,875
<i>don't give a damn.</i>

1304
01:56:13,625 --> 01:56:14,667
Give me the stars.

1305
01:56:16,917 --> 01:56:17,833
Give them to me!

1306
01:56:26,167 --> 01:56:27,083
Kai-si.

1307
01:56:29,833 --> 01:56:31,125
Our years of friendship

1308
01:56:32,875 --> 01:56:34,375
couldn't beat these bags of money.

1309
01:56:36,792 --> 01:56:37,667
Really?

1310
01:56:54,833 --> 01:56:55,792
I will redeem him.

1311
01:57:02,167 --> 01:57:03,417
I think it'll be better

1312
01:57:04,250 --> 01:57:06,375
if you tell your son that in person.

1313
01:57:07,083 --> 01:57:08,792
I lost my dad when I was eight.

1314
01:57:09,625 --> 01:57:11,958
So, I understand how your son feels now.

1315
01:57:12,750 --> 01:57:14,833
He might not need expensive medications.

1316
01:57:16,917 --> 01:57:18,167
But he definitely

1317
01:57:19,292 --> 01:57:20,500
needs you.

1318
01:57:25,833 --> 01:57:26,917
Young man.

1319
01:57:27,375 --> 01:57:28,917
Thank you.

1320
01:59:21,708 --> 01:59:22,583
Bastard.

1321
01:59:42,167 --> 01:59:43,125
Zheng Kai-si.

1322
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:46,208
You should go to hell.

1323
01:59:48,958 --> 01:59:50,000
That's what I deserve.

1324
01:59:53,958 --> 01:59:55,833
But I only want to die in your arms.

1325
02:00:06,375 --> 02:00:07,500
<i>I have fought</i>

1326
02:00:08,375 --> 02:00:09,750

<i>I have finished</i>

<i>And I'm still crazy.</i>

1333

<i>I don't care.</i>

1335
02:01:07,292 --> 02:01:08,708
<i>Mr. Go to Hell.</i>

1336
02:01:08,792 --> 02:01:09,708
<i>Wake up.</i>

1337
02:01:09,875 --> 02:01:10,917
<i>Come get the medication.</i>

1338
02:01:15,708 --> 02:01:16,542
Coming.
