1
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:29,835
CHACHI 420 (The Crooked Aunt)

2
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:34,835
Mrs Janki Devi!
Present yourself in court!

3
00:00:39,315 --> 00:00:42,235
Mr Jaiprakash Paswan!
Present yourself in court!

4
00:00:44,715 --> 00:00:47,595
He hasn't turned up, has he?
Sit down... please.

5
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:54,995
The court's time is precious.
In view of that...

6
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:58,715
I appeal that the proceedings
of the court continue.

7
00:00:58,995 --> 00:01:01,435
What could be holding him up?

8
00:01:01,515 --> 00:01:05,195
Why'd I be here, if I
knew that, Your Honour?

9
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:10,475
I wonder whose tunes he
must be dancing to right now.

10
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:55,155
You'd better be careful here...

11
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:27,595
I need the steadycam, Raman!

12
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,475
Where are you off to? Won't
you sit here for a while?

13
00:02:33,515 --> 00:02:34,555
Let me go...

14
00:02:36,755 --> 00:02:40,115
What is it?
The anger on your nose!

15
00:02:40,395 --> 00:02:43,475
You look like an obstinate kid!

16
00:02:43,635 --> 00:02:46,915
I'm no kid...
I have fathered a kid.

17
00:02:46,955 --> 00:02:49,675
So what? Let's live together.

18
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:53,155
You can ask me to leave,
if you can't stand me.

19
00:02:55,595 --> 00:02:58,515
Really? Here goes!

20
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:00,795
Massage this hand, too.

21
00:03:01,835 --> 00:03:04,755
He's terribly angry.
I see. My God!

22
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:08,955
I've got to go to the Court, sir.

23
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:12,035
How can you leave like this?
Finish the first stanza!

24
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:18,195
If I wait for the first stanza,
the second one will begin in court.

25
00:03:18,355 --> 00:03:22,515
You're making haste as if
you're about to miss a divorce!

26
00:03:25,115 --> 00:03:27,275
We've had four adjournments...

27
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:29,995
...on account of the absence and
late-coming of the respondent.

28
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:35,795
I appeal to you to grant
my client a divorce.

29
00:03:36,035 --> 00:03:37,595
That's wonderful!

30
00:03:37,755 --> 00:03:41,435
Your Honour...
I apologise for the delay!

31
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:46,595
Go on! You're being
summoned since long.

32
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:08,715
I'm sorry. I was delayed
in leaving the studio.

33
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,675
You're in court; not home.

34
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,395
I'm not your wife here.
The Judge is...

35
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:18,075
I mean, you must give him an explanation.

36
00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:20,915
It's all the same. You were
my judge at home...

37
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:23,035
and the judge is my wife...!

38
00:04:26,635 --> 00:04:30,755
Did you know that your husband
works in the film industry?

39
00:04:30,795 --> 00:04:34,155
Yes, I knew he was a buffoon.

40
00:04:35,995 --> 00:04:39,395
That he dances.
Is one who dances a buffoon?

41
00:04:39,755 --> 00:04:40,875
What else is he?

42
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:44,635
Who is Natraj then, the God of
dance, whom you worship?

43
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:50,595
Did you marry him in spite
of knowing all this?

44
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:52,315
Was it a love-marriage?

45
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:57,955
No! I knew he danced and
made others dance, too.

46
00:04:57,995 --> 00:05:01,715
Little did I know that he'd
make me dance to his tunes.

47
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:05,035
I was blinded by love, Your Honour.

48
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:19,675
When are we getting married?

49
00:05:19,915 --> 00:05:21,795
We will soon...
what's the hurry?

50
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:27,475
I'm in a hurry to be
known as Mrs. Paswan.

51
00:05:27,835 --> 00:05:29,714
We'll have children then!

52
00:05:29,715 --> 00:05:32,915
Only the devils make haste.

53
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:37,755
Ask your devil...
I mean, ask your father first.

54
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:42,395
Oh no! Left to him, we can
only have a divorce!

55
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:45,075
What can we have?
A divorce!

56
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:48,595
He will never approve of it!

57
00:05:48,675 --> 00:05:54,835
I'll beg of him to give me
his moonlike daughter!

58
00:05:55,715 --> 00:05:59,315
Why bother when the daughter
is herself coming to you?

59
00:05:59,515 --> 00:06:03,155
That which you consider trouble
is actually decency.

60
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:06,675
What did I get from her father
in return for my decency?

61
00:06:06,715 --> 00:06:10,195
What did he give you? Did he
beat you up or abuse you?

62
00:06:10,435 --> 00:06:15,915
No sir! The rich Mr Durgaprasad
Bhardwaj is not given to abuses.

63
00:06:16,195 --> 00:06:20,115
He has better ways of humiliating people.

64
00:06:20,155 --> 00:06:22,435
He belongs to a great family, you see.

65
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:26,035
This is my great grandfather,
Mr Chandiprasad Bhardwaj.

66
00:06:26,675 --> 00:06:30,355
This is my grandfather,
Mr Shaktiprasad Bhardwaj.

67
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:35,755
And this is my father,
Mr Bhawaniprasad Bhardwaj.

68
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:41,435
I'm next in the line...
Durgaprasad Bhardwaj.

69
00:06:43,475 --> 00:06:47,115
Doesn't the name Jaiprakash
Paswan sound a jarring note...

70
00:06:47,235 --> 00:06:50,755
...after Durgaprasad Bhardwaj?

71
00:06:52,635 --> 00:06:55,635
By the way, what is your profession?

72
00:06:56,435 --> 00:07:00,715
I'm assistant to a choreographer in cinema.

73
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:03,835
That's all very well. But what
do you do for a living?

74
00:07:04,515 --> 00:07:06,275
That's my profession.
'That' is?!

75
00:07:07,835 --> 00:07:11,235
You'd better smile...
Janki is watching us.

76
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:18,595
Actually, my daughter
has grown fond of you.

77
00:07:18,835 --> 00:07:23,075
In exactly the same manner
as kids are fond of toys.

78
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:27,715
You can play with toys for some days...

79
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:32,435
...but you can't spend a lifetime
with them, can you?

80
00:07:32,595 --> 00:07:37,235
Coffee? No, you won't...!
Take it away... Go on.

81
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:46,875
Janki is my only daughter.
I can't refuse her anything.

82
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:52,315
I want you to do that for me.

83
00:07:52,675 --> 00:07:57,235
Take this box away.
It contains "two" wads.

84
00:07:58,315 --> 00:08:01,675
Two wads of currency notes;
Not footwear.

85
00:08:02,035 --> 00:08:04,435
It's two hundred thousand.

86
00:08:14,515 --> 00:08:16,875
This is a nice way of humiliating someone.

87
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:21,955
People give dowry so the groom
will take their daughter away.

88
00:08:22,515 --> 00:08:26,235
Your father gives it for not
taking away his daughter!

89
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:29,955
Tell me; what do you prefer?
One in tune or out-of-sync?

90
00:08:29,995 --> 00:08:34,995
What do you want to be?
Bhardwaj? Or Paswan?

91
00:08:35,155 --> 00:08:36,875
I leave the decision to you.

92
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:51,795
You're having a great
rehearsal, aren't you?

93
00:08:51,915 --> 00:08:53,795
But this is the final take!

94
00:08:53,835 --> 00:08:57,515
The bridal-necklace and the
wife are both genuine.

95
00:08:57,715 --> 00:09:01,795
This is my wife. And that
is Janki... I mean, Chandu.

96
00:09:01,995 --> 00:09:04,355
I'm nervous. It's my
first marriage!

97
00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:07,595
What?
He's from the art department.

98
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:09,395
I'm sorry!

99
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,595
This stinks of glue!

100
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,595
Yes. Mine stinks a little less.
Here you are.

101
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:21,195
We've just prepared it.
I'll go and drop them.

102
00:09:23,715 --> 00:09:26,515
Had only father been here...

103
00:09:26,955 --> 00:09:30,355
Think of what he'd do to me!

104
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:35,835
I mean, we'd have a shower of
real flowers at our wedding.

105
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:39,235
And I'd have had a garland of
large footwear around my neck.

106
00:09:39,435 --> 00:09:41,875
He wears a smaller size.

107
00:09:42,835 --> 00:09:47,795
You're crazy! Wipe your tears.
Let's pray to God.

108
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,795
There's no God!
Atheist! Shut up!

109
00:10:03,915 --> 00:10:06,435
He's left!
Must've gone for some milk...

110
00:10:06,595 --> 00:10:08,355
I'm not kidding!

111
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:13,955
Where are you taking the Ganpati idol, Rao?

112
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:16,355
We need it for the shoot
at Studio No. 7.

113
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:17,995
Who's the female co-star?

114
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:22,955
It's a mythology...
He's the only Hero!

115
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:26,755
This man showed me stars in broad daylight!

116
00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:28,635
Fake flowers, a fake God...

117
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:33,835
Excuse me, Your Honour. Have
you ever seen the real God?

118
00:10:34,075 --> 00:10:35,635
Wow! What a scene!

119
00:10:37,515 --> 00:10:40,915
It was a make-believe temple.
The marriage was fake too!

120
00:10:40,955 --> 00:10:44,755
What about our daughter?
Is she make-believe, too?

121
00:10:45,755 --> 00:10:47,515
This is not all, Your Honour.

122
00:10:47,835 --> 00:10:50,875
He's in the habit of abusing
his wife in a fit of rage.

123
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:52,955
Did Janki tell you that?

124
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:56,235
No. Her family did.
But I'm her family.

125
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:59,515
Not my family.
Our landlord told you that.

126
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:03,915
You're right! Haribhai, the
landlord, told me everything.

127
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:10,395
Where have you been scurrying
away like a rat?

128
00:11:11,355 --> 00:11:14,475
You owe me rent for three months, Jai.

129
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,635
Either pay up or vacate the house.

130
00:11:17,795 --> 00:11:21,275
Actually, I'm in a tight
corner right now...

131
00:11:21,475 --> 00:11:24,315
You're in a tight corner,
whenever I ask you for the rent!

132
00:11:24,715 --> 00:11:28,035
How about the 24" inch TV
you have just bought?

133
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:31,595
A television set?
Acting innocent now, eh?

134
00:11:31,795 --> 00:11:35,275
Go and take a look. Your TV and
wife are both in great shape!

135
00:11:37,555 --> 00:11:39,115
Do you want to break it?

136
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:42,875
Don't keep it there...
move it over here.

137
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,955
Papa! We have a TV!
A new one!

138
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:54,715
Where did the TV come from?
From the market. Where else?

139
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,555
I mean, what was the hurry?

140
00:11:57,835 --> 00:12:00,515
I've bought it for Bharti;
Not for myself.

141
00:12:03,595 --> 00:12:07,315
Didn't you say TV spoils
the kids' education?

142
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:10,115
Your film songs are not the
only fare on television.

143
00:12:10,315 --> 00:12:12,515
There are educational programmes, too.

144
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:15,995
I don't like Bharti going to
our neighbours to watch them.

145
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,395
You know that I have
no money for such things.

146
00:12:19,515 --> 00:12:22,115
Sure, I do. Which is why I've
bought it on installments.

147
00:12:22,315 --> 00:12:24,475
My pay-packet itself
comes in installments!

148
00:12:24,515 --> 00:12:27,835
Where do I put this antenna?
Here on my head! Come on!

149
00:12:29,955 --> 00:12:33,155
Shut up! You're always giggling
without any reason!

150
00:12:33,195 --> 00:12:35,875
Don't bring out your anger
on the kid. Let's get ready...

151
00:12:36,115 --> 00:12:37,955
Where to? Finish this
argument first!

152
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:42,355
What argument? I need my wife
and you need the TV. Period.

153
00:12:42,555 --> 00:12:45,355
Get Bharti ready.
They'll arrive at any moment.

154
00:12:45,395 --> 00:12:47,995
Bharti will not go.
Why not?

155
00:12:48,075 --> 00:12:50,435
I consulted you before I
committed the shoot. And now...

156
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:52,475
I refuse now.
But why?

157
00:12:52,595 --> 00:12:54,155
Papa won't give me the permission.

158
00:12:54,395 --> 00:12:58,035
She's my daughter. Why must we
need permission from your Papa?

159
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:00,595
Is she ready?
Oh yes.

160
00:13:02,635 --> 00:13:06,195
Aren't you ready, dear?
We'll be late for the shoot.

161
00:13:06,355 --> 00:13:08,395
She will not report for
the shoot. Please go out.

162
00:13:08,475 --> 00:13:13,355
Will you get going? And keep
your show business out of my house!

163
00:13:13,635 --> 00:13:18,195
We're committed to them, Janki.
We can discuss the future.

164
00:13:18,395 --> 00:13:21,435
Please let her shoot...
It's only for today.

165
00:13:21,595 --> 00:13:24,875
And you stand to make 10,000 Rupees.

166
00:13:24,955 --> 00:13:28,635
I see! So you've negotiated
the price, too!

167
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:32,435
Bhardwaj's grand-daughter is
no buffoon to work in films!

168
00:13:32,675 --> 00:13:33,835
Get out!

169
00:13:34,635 --> 00:13:36,875
J.P.! You said it was your
daughter who'd work with us!

170
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:39,035
How does Bhardwaj's
granddaughter figure in this?

171
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:41,435
Bhardwaj's daughter is
my daughter's mother, too!

172
00:13:41,475 --> 00:13:44,155
I mean, my wife is the
mother of my child...

173
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:47,275
Come in for a moment...
Don't touch me!

174
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:49,255
Aren't you ashamed to
live off your daughter?

175
00:13:49,355 --> 00:13:51,195
Please don't fight, Mom...
Oh, move away!

176
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:53,835
Know what they call someone
who lives off his daughter?

177
00:13:55,315 --> 00:13:59,395
Let them hear! What do they
call women who dance for money?

178
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:05,835
Please don't fight, Mom.
Say sorry to Dad.

179
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:09,675
Did you slap your wife in
the presence of a few others?

180
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,915
There were many people there.
Not a few.

181
00:14:11,955 --> 00:14:14,595
They were there, nevertheless.
Please consider the reasons.

182
00:14:14,795 --> 00:14:19,675
Mr Jaiprakash... Paswan!
Reasons won't do.

183
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,075
Did you slap her?

184
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:27,755
Don't friends fight? They even
have fisticuffs, Your Honour.

185
00:14:27,795 --> 00:14:33,155
They don't go to the courts.
But both of you have.

186
00:14:33,395 --> 00:14:36,555
So? Is it "yes" or "no"?

187
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:42,835
What's okay, Your Honour?
What are you writing...

188
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:44,315
It's a yes-no!

189
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,115
Did you say yes?
Yes.

190
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:50,835
Yes means yes then.
Yes, but...

191
00:14:51,435 --> 00:14:54,875
It's all over! He has
confessed to his crime!

192
00:14:54,915 --> 00:14:57,595
That's exactly what I'm getting at!

193
00:14:58,075 --> 00:15:00,435
Having completed the legal formalities...

194
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:05,675
I grant Jaiprakash and
Janki Devi a legal divorce.

195
00:15:06,555 --> 00:15:12,115
Henceforth, you will not live
together as man and wife.

196
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:15,995
For the purpose of a
good upbringing and care...

197
00:15:16,075 --> 00:15:19,795
your daughter Bharti is
entrusted to your wife Janki.

198
00:15:19,955 --> 00:15:22,635
No, Your Honour!

199
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:27,675
According to Law, the child
will remain with her mother.

200
00:15:27,835 --> 00:15:29,915
Especially in circumstances
where she can provide...

201
00:15:30,075 --> 00:15:33,515
for the child, in a better
way than you can.

202
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:35,155
That's it!

203
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,955
No! I will give her
a good upbringing!

204
00:15:38,235 --> 00:15:40,435
Please don't separate her from me.

205
00:15:42,315 --> 00:15:44,275
There has never been an occasion...

206
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:48,075
when I have gone to sleep
without seeing her.

207
00:15:48,555 --> 00:15:50,035
And when I have awoken...

208
00:15:50,036 --> 00:15:55,835
Do you know anything else
apart from acting?

209
00:15:56,275 --> 00:16:01,035
I do. I'm capable
of being tolerant.

210
00:16:02,075 --> 00:16:04,715
I'm even capable of living on.

211
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:13,875
Once a week, on every Friday,
away from your houses...

212
00:16:14,075 --> 00:16:16,475
you can meet your daughter
at any public place.

213
00:16:16,995 --> 00:16:19,155
Is that okay, Miss Janki?

214
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:24,395
Get their signed approval on the documents.

215
00:18:44,595 --> 00:18:46,915
My father!
Who makes 'em bite the dust!

216
00:18:47,995 --> 00:18:50,635
My little girl!
Who looks so lovely!

217
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:54,275
What is the day today?
Today? It's Friday.

218
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:57,475
Of course it's Friday.

219
00:18:57,715 --> 00:19:01,115
It's a good Friday;
Because we meet today!

220
00:19:04,155 --> 00:19:06,475
Damn this phone!
It's always ringing!

221
00:19:06,795 --> 00:19:09,035
Who the hell is it?
...Master?!

222
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:11,915
They're here before my eyes!

223
00:19:11,995 --> 00:19:14,435
Where's "here"?

224
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:16,875
We're at Sanyas Ashram in Vile Parle.

225
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:21,275
You remember all your
instructions, don't you?

226
00:19:21,515 --> 00:19:24,995
Oh yes. I have a list
of that in my pocket.

227
00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:26,635
Please don't worry...

228
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,675
Can't you lay off?
I'm talking to the boss!

229
00:19:29,915 --> 00:19:32,755
They've left!
Why didn't you tell me?

230
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,195
But I was telling you!
Tickling isn't telling...!

231
00:19:44,715 --> 00:19:46,395
What have you asked God for?

232
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:50,275
I told L.K...
Who's that?

233
00:19:50,395 --> 00:19:54,755
Lord Krishna! I asked Him
to make me an old woman!

234
00:19:55,115 --> 00:19:58,715
Silly girl! No one will marry
you, if you're an old woman.

235
00:19:58,755 --> 00:20:01,195
That's better! There at least
won't be a divorce then.

236
00:20:08,395 --> 00:20:13,235
Why does the God of Dance
stand on one foot?

237
00:20:14,035 --> 00:20:18,115
I don't know.
Or He'd fall. Simple!

238
00:20:23,275 --> 00:20:25,355
And here is your double.

239
00:20:27,675 --> 00:20:30,475
Hold it! You can't give the
girl anything to eat!

240
00:20:30,715 --> 00:20:34,195
Says who?
The boss has given me a list!

241
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:36,835
What does it say?

242
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:41,395
It says I can feed her in my lap.

243
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:43,955
Yes... You can do that.

244
00:20:46,435 --> 00:20:47,955
Hurry up!

245
00:20:49,075 --> 00:20:52,275
What's "hurry up"?
This is no instant-noodles!

246
00:20:52,315 --> 00:20:56,875
I'm talking to my daughter...
move away by at least 20 feet!

247
00:20:58,235 --> 00:21:02,355
Stop acting like ducks!
You don't have to obey him!

248
00:21:02,915 --> 00:21:04,235
Come here!

249
00:21:05,115 --> 00:21:09,115
The court order says you can't
meet her in a private place.

250
00:21:09,555 --> 00:21:13,315
You must meet her only at
a public place! Understand?

251
00:21:13,715 --> 00:21:18,155
Where we are all stand...

252
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:21,835
Me, too, Sir?
Of course! You too!

253
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:24,995
Where the hell has he gone?!

254
00:21:26,075 --> 00:21:28,515
Find him, you blind bats!

255
00:21:29,675 --> 00:21:33,355
You're a bloody fool! You just
said they were there...

256
00:21:33,475 --> 00:21:39,275
and you now say they're not!
They must be around! Find them!

257
00:21:43,355 --> 00:21:46,555
We look for you everywhere...
and here you are!

258
00:21:46,795 --> 00:21:50,635
Do you know how late it is?
"You" are late.

259
00:21:50,795 --> 00:21:52,715
We've been here for a very long time.

260
00:21:53,035 --> 00:21:56,595
So... I know you've got to go
home and finish your homework.

261
00:21:56,755 --> 00:21:59,315
Now get lost! I'll deal with
you next Friday!

262
00:21:59,435 --> 00:22:01,435
I'll fasten a rope around the neck!

263
00:22:02,115 --> 00:22:03,395
Whose neck?

264
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:06,435
My own!

265
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:10,235
Don't act smart with me...!
Oh, shut up!

266
00:22:10,795 --> 00:22:13,075
How about another riddle, Papa?
Go ahead.

267
00:22:13,235 --> 00:22:17,475
Why do you wear a watch?
I don't know.

268
00:22:17,835 --> 00:22:20,035
So it keeps ticking... see?!

269
00:22:21,475 --> 00:22:23,355
Won't you laugh?

270
00:22:25,675 --> 00:22:27,715
Okay, that's enough...
Let's go!

271
00:22:50,395 --> 00:22:53,555
My blood is boiling! The
little one is my daughter...

272
00:22:53,635 --> 00:22:55,835
not a TV programme I can
watch only on Fridays!

273
00:22:56,195 --> 00:22:57,895
The father-in-law took
his daughter away...

274
00:22:57,915 --> 00:22:59,355
you must steal your daughter now.

275
00:22:59,395 --> 00:23:04,835
Are your brains rotting?
Not at all! They're fresh!

276
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:10,275
No point in getting worked up.
Make a get away with your girl!

277
00:23:10,395 --> 00:23:13,115
Go anywhere near Kashmir...
maybe Bangalore or Mysore.

278
00:23:13,155 --> 00:23:17,675
Bangalore or Mysore are
nowhere near Kashmir!

279
00:23:18,195 --> 00:23:20,955
So go to the South...
Maybe Dubai or Muscat!

280
00:23:21,155 --> 00:23:24,555
I have many relatives there.
They'll take good care of you.

281
00:23:24,955 --> 00:23:29,155
The old man has run away with the hen!

282
00:23:29,515 --> 00:23:31,755
You must now steal the egg!

283
00:23:48,955 --> 00:23:53,915
My pet! Come to me...
Just shut your mouth!

284
00:23:54,235 --> 00:23:59,115
I have a romantic rendezvous
with Kaushi tonight...!

285
00:24:32,115 --> 00:24:34,715
How do you make those noises?
No matter where I touch you!

286
00:24:35,155 --> 00:24:37,315
If you keep tickling me like this...

287
00:24:37,355 --> 00:24:39,435
you will soon have to buy toys for kids!

288
00:24:39,715 --> 00:24:42,915
What toys are these between you and me?

289
00:24:48,435 --> 00:24:50,375
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

290
00:24:50,395 --> 00:24:52,875
I came to meet you.
What for?

291
00:24:53,195 --> 00:24:57,235
To run away with you...
why are you laughing?

292
00:24:57,835 --> 00:25:02,115
I thought I was running
away with you! Let's shake!

293
00:25:04,515 --> 00:25:07,955
How did it occur to you
to escape from here?

294
00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:10,475
I don't know.
I just felt like it.

295
00:25:11,315 --> 00:25:13,755
Must be in the blood.
Pardon me?

296
00:25:14,395 --> 00:25:17,195
It's a long story.
So tell me.

297
00:25:17,835 --> 00:25:21,235
I'd run away with your mother
from this very place.

298
00:25:21,475 --> 00:25:24,355
And what happened then?
Mom got pregnant...

299
00:25:24,475 --> 00:25:28,875
and we had a little angel!
Where is she? The angel?

300
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:33,755
Where is she... my God!
I'm carrying the angel!

301
00:25:36,955 --> 00:25:41,115
I'll show you a new way...
What are you doing?!

302
00:25:41,955 --> 00:25:44,355
It's an electronic tickle!

303
00:25:56,035 --> 00:26:01,675
You dare break in to commit
a robbery at this hour!

304
00:26:02,275 --> 00:26:05,715
You've shown your true colours!
You came to steal the kid!

305
00:26:05,915 --> 00:26:07,915
Now don't let's talk about...
Shut up!

306
00:26:08,675 --> 00:26:12,555
Banwa! Where the hell are you?
I'm coming, sir!

307
00:26:12,755 --> 00:26:15,155
You're sleeping through
the tremors, are you?!

308
00:26:15,355 --> 00:26:17,875
I have a clean heart, sir!
The moment I lie down, I...

309
00:26:18,315 --> 00:26:20,355
When did you arrive,
son-in-law?

310
00:26:22,075 --> 00:26:25,595
Son-in-law, my foot!
He's a bloody thief?

311
00:26:27,075 --> 00:26:29,795
Take Bharti in, Janki!

312
00:26:30,395 --> 00:26:32,315
Come here, Bharti.

313
00:26:35,315 --> 00:26:36,275
Go on...

314
00:26:38,235 --> 00:26:41,555
No more meetings on Friday henceforth!

315
00:26:41,995 --> 00:26:46,795
I won't even let him set eye
on the girl! Call the cops!

316
00:26:48,755 --> 00:26:50,075
You dare...

317
00:26:50,635 --> 00:26:55,355
Step forward, guys! I could
hurt him in a fit of rage!

318
00:27:00,235 --> 00:27:03,795
I'm releasing him on your
assurance, Mr Siraj Akhtar.

319
00:27:03,995 --> 00:27:07,155
Make sure he doesn't make
such a mistake again.

320
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:10,995
Jai! My friend!

321
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:21,555
How will I repay this debt?

322
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:24,155
Have me released, when they lock me up!

323
00:27:24,515 --> 00:27:25,995
There are no favours between friends!

324
00:27:26,195 --> 00:27:29,635
You've really insulted me!
Not at all. I'm sorry!

325
00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:33,675
Get me a role in a film, if
you must do something for me.

326
00:27:33,955 --> 00:27:36,995
I'm dying to be an actor!
Consider yourself one!

327
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:42,115
I can't dance. I'll give the
producer a discount for that.

328
00:27:43,075 --> 00:27:45,755
Woman wanted?
We all need women...

329
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:47,675
to play the female lead.

330
00:27:47,795 --> 00:27:51,235
I want to graduate to lead
roles from small parts.

331
00:27:51,635 --> 00:27:54,475
Make me an inspector,
a judge or even a beggar!

332
00:27:54,795 --> 00:27:58,275
Why must I feel shy?
I'm only acting!

333
00:27:58,555 --> 00:28:01,755
"A penny for me, sir...
May God bless your children!"

334
00:28:37,235 --> 00:28:40,435
Father! Look at what
Jai is up to!

335
00:28:42,675 --> 00:28:45,275
Isn't this "thing" the one
you called your husband?

336
00:28:46,675 --> 00:28:49,475
He's after her with his tail wagging!

337
00:29:01,195 --> 00:29:03,675
This is no way, Joseph...

338
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:08,395
They all say that! I've been
hearing it for 25 years!

339
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:12,515
It's nothing new! I've been
drinking for 25 years!

340
00:29:12,715 --> 00:29:14,835
You're always on your own trip.
Take a look at this!

341
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:19,035
Wow! Bagpiper Gold!
This is my brand!

342
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:22,475
Turn it around, Joseph!

343
00:29:22,755 --> 00:29:25,915
D'you take me for a fool
to spill the booze?

344
00:29:26,115 --> 00:29:30,195
Turn this hand around!
But what is it?

345
00:29:31,115 --> 00:29:32,795
It is an advertisement.

346
00:29:33,595 --> 00:29:38,115
Issued by Madam Janki Bhardwaj,
who wants a woman...

347
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:40,395
...to look after a
5-year old girl.

348
00:29:40,435 --> 00:29:43,995
Isn't she a woman herself?!
But she wants a Brahmin...

349
00:29:44,155 --> 00:29:46,955
Isn't she a Brahmin herself?
Can't she look after my girl?

350
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:49,995
The woman must be educated
and very hygienic!

351
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:52,595
Why don't you talk to her?

352
00:29:52,635 --> 00:29:55,195
They won't even let me into the house.

353
00:29:57,035 --> 00:30:00,315
Have you broken your nose?
I think so.

354
00:30:00,595 --> 00:30:03,555
You're not an actor, I hope?
No.

355
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:05,895
It's okay then. Are you done
with the make-up, Joseph?

356
00:30:05,955 --> 00:30:08,195
I'm doing it! It takes time...

357
00:30:08,595 --> 00:30:11,755
It's my misfortune that
I was born in India.

358
00:30:11,835 --> 00:30:15,915
This is a skill! Give me time
and see the magic I work!

359
00:30:16,195 --> 00:30:18,155
What would you do?
Take birth in America?

360
00:30:18,435 --> 00:30:21,235
I can work the magic here in India!

361
00:30:21,275 --> 00:30:23,475
I can turn a man into a woman;
And a woman into a man!

362
00:30:25,555 --> 00:30:30,515
I can make a prince a princess
and a king a courtesan!

363
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:34,515
So what do you want to be?

364
00:30:36,715 --> 00:30:39,195
Again? Haven't you seen this?
The newspaper?

365
00:30:39,395 --> 00:30:43,195
I want to be a woman!

366
00:30:44,715 --> 00:30:49,795
What kind of a woman?
Like this one or this?

367
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:55,835
I get it! A slim figure, right?

368
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:04,235
I want to be like this.
Like this?! What a dish!

369
00:31:05,715 --> 00:31:09,475
She's your wife, isn't she?
Yes.

370
00:31:09,915 --> 00:31:12,715
There's another picture in the picture.

371
00:31:12,755 --> 00:31:15,555
Really? Is this a bag
of photographs?

372
00:31:17,315 --> 00:31:20,155
Look at the picture on the wall.

373
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:26,675
She resembles your wife!
Naturally. She's her mother.

374
00:31:27,515 --> 00:31:31,955
You plan to barge in, posing
as the mother-in-law, right?

375
00:31:32,075 --> 00:31:35,955
Yes. But no one must
get to know of it.

376
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:40,475
Not at all! But what about
the fact that I know?

377
00:31:40,675 --> 00:31:45,555
I'll keep quiet. But there
could be a slip of tongue!

378
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:47,755
You can't squeal on a friend!

379
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:51,155
In which case, I'll do
the make-up for free.

380
00:31:51,395 --> 00:31:54,395
But arrange to slip me 10 or 20 grand.

381
00:31:55,435 --> 00:32:01,995
- 20 grand?! I'm selling my bike
to give you 4 thousand!

382
00:32:02,595 --> 00:32:06,395
- 4 thousand? You must really
sell it at 20 grand then!

383
00:32:06,635 --> 00:32:10,115
Who'd buy it? Very well...
You can have the mobike.

384
00:32:10,355 --> 00:32:17,355
Okay. Just double my quota.
Give me a full, not a nip!

385
00:32:18,315 --> 00:32:21,155
All right. I'll go and make
a call to Durgaprasad now.

386
00:32:21,555 --> 00:32:24,395
To tell him that you're
about to enter in disguise?

387
00:32:24,635 --> 00:32:26,595
Looks like the kick is wearing off!

388
00:32:26,995 --> 00:32:29,235
Keep drinking!
You'll remain sober!

389
00:32:29,435 --> 00:32:32,915
Really? Great idea!
Let's hit the bottle!

390
00:32:38,995 --> 00:32:41,595
It's because they're all white, you know...

391
00:32:52,155 --> 00:32:54,555
Greetings, sir.
Who is that?

392
00:32:55,315 --> 00:32:58,955
I have seen your advertisement.
Where did you see it?

393
00:32:59,595 --> 00:33:01,555
Glued to a woman's bottom.
What?!

394
00:33:02,195 --> 00:33:06,955
You need a woman to look
after a child, isn't it?

395
00:33:07,155 --> 00:33:09,235
Have you seen it?
Yes, sir.

396
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:13,475
So what?
So when can I come over?

397
00:33:14,475 --> 00:33:18,115
Where? And what for?
For the job, of course.

398
00:33:19,035 --> 00:33:24,475
I see! When have you called the
governesses for an interview?

399
00:33:25,075 --> 00:33:26,995
Who is that?
At what time is it?!

400
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:34,355
At 11 a.m.
Be here at 11 a.m. Tomorrow.

401
00:33:35,435 --> 00:33:38,715
How old is she...
what is her age?

402
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:41,755
Your age... Shut up!

403
00:33:43,035 --> 00:33:48,475
It wasn't you I spoke to...
Be here at 11 tomorrow. And so?

404
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:50,755
So?
So what?

405
00:33:51,035 --> 00:33:55,715
So, all right.
I'll be there tomorrow.

406
00:33:56,595 --> 00:33:58,555
What did you say your name was?

407
00:33:59,195 --> 00:34:00,715
I didn't tell you my name.

408
00:34:01,435 --> 00:34:08,435
The name? It's the bus!
I can't hear you properly!

409
00:34:13,155 --> 00:34:16,915
Lux...
What? Not Lux, the soap?!

410
00:34:17,275 --> 00:34:21,795
I'm not reading an ad...
My name is Lux-mi!

411
00:34:22,595 --> 00:34:26,275
I see. Laxmi? What next?
I'm a woman.

412
00:34:26,995 --> 00:34:30,515
I can hear that.
But what is your surname?

413
00:34:31,435 --> 00:34:33,515
My surname?

414
00:34:36,635 --> 00:34:43,435
Have sweet, talk sweet...!
God-bole (sweet-talk).

415
00:34:45,035 --> 00:34:47,475
That's the surname... Godbole!
Laxmi Godbole!

416
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:51,635
Are you a Maharashtrian?
Yes.

417
00:34:52,555 --> 00:34:57,395
Godbole's are Maharashtrians.
I'm a High Class Brahmin.

418
00:34:57,915 --> 00:35:00,395
I'm related to the Royal Baji Rao family.

419
00:35:00,435 --> 00:35:02,675
The grand-daughter of his
sister's grandson...

420
00:35:02,915 --> 00:35:05,115
is related to my mother's aunt.

421
00:35:05,595 --> 00:35:08,915
Well, all right. Bring them
all tomorrow at eleven.

422
00:35:09,115 --> 00:35:12,155
They're all dead.
How will I bring them?

423
00:35:12,715 --> 00:35:16,595
You may come alone then.
Thank you, sir.

424
00:35:25,755 --> 00:35:26,955
It's dead!

425
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:52,995
Remember; this make-up
lasts for a limited time.

426
00:35:53,355 --> 00:35:55,635
Can't it be permanent?

427
00:35:55,675 --> 00:36:00,475
In that case, wouldn't I have
you living with me instead?!

428
00:36:01,955 --> 00:36:06,835
Remember; get back to your
house, before sunset everyday.

429
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:11,115
Or you'll be exposed with
your fake-nose...

430
00:36:11,355 --> 00:36:14,635
and I'll lose face, too!

431
00:36:15,315 --> 00:36:20,355
Make sure you get home
on time every evening!

432
00:36:22,035 --> 00:36:24,795
Here is the final touch!

433
00:37:52,475 --> 00:37:53,915
Wait... ladies first!

434
00:37:53,955 --> 00:37:55,835
Will this go to Juhu?
Yes, it will.

435
00:38:13,675 --> 00:38:14,835
What happened?

436
00:38:15,515 --> 00:38:19,395
It's the hair-loss, you see.
So it tickles.

437
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:24,555
I have the same problem.
Feel my hair.

438
00:38:25,195 --> 00:38:28,155
Ajob paying a thousand Rupees
with 2000 questions asked!

439
00:38:28,355 --> 00:38:29,755
Don't you talk too much!

440
00:38:30,355 --> 00:38:32,475
Who's Shakuntala?

441
00:38:39,355 --> 00:38:41,835
Wait! I'm coming, too!

442
00:38:46,915 --> 00:38:48,875
Why did you leave the earlier job?

443
00:38:48,915 --> 00:38:53,075
Her employers moved to the U.S.
She didn't go with them.

444
00:38:53,355 --> 00:38:56,955
She loves India.
Since when do you know her?

445
00:38:57,355 --> 00:39:02,435
From this morning! I have made
all the enquiries for you.

446
00:39:13,355 --> 00:39:16,955
You may leave.
We have appointed someone.

447
00:39:18,515 --> 00:39:21,875
Go on... we have
found a governess.

448
00:39:22,315 --> 00:39:27,315
Why issue ads. When they had
already decided on someone?

449
00:39:36,475 --> 00:39:38,955
Give it to me, Babu...
I want it!

450
00:39:39,475 --> 00:39:41,435
Sure. Here you are.

451
00:40:00,595 --> 00:40:02,315
Mummy!

452
00:40:07,635 --> 00:40:12,035
Help me someone!
My bottom's on fire!

453
00:40:15,435 --> 00:40:16,955
No...!

454
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:23,995
Help, Mummy! Help!

455
00:40:46,395 --> 00:40:50,355
What happened to Bharti?!
Move aside!

456
00:40:55,515 --> 00:41:00,875
My poor child!
She's burnt her skin, Papa!

457
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:03,595
Which idiot threw her into the pool?!

458
00:41:03,715 --> 00:41:05,315
That idiot of a woman did!

459
00:41:05,715 --> 00:41:07,635
Who the hell are you?
What are you doing here?

460
00:41:08,715 --> 00:41:13,555
My name is Laxmi Godbole.
I spoke to you over the phone.

461
00:41:13,835 --> 00:41:15,915
Don't you know you must
never pour water on burns?!

462
00:41:16,155 --> 00:41:18,675
You ought to wrap a blanket!
She could get septic!

463
00:41:19,315 --> 00:41:20,995
She won't be, sir...

464
00:41:21,555 --> 00:41:25,275
Why not? Whatever the
boss says always happens!

465
00:41:25,355 --> 00:41:29,035
Don't just stand here!
Go and telephone the doctor!

466
00:41:29,355 --> 00:41:32,595
There's no need for
skin-grafting, is there?

467
00:41:32,675 --> 00:41:36,355
It's a minor injury.
She'll be fine in a few days.

468
00:41:37,675 --> 00:41:39,995
Did someone wrap her in a blanket?

469
00:41:40,315 --> 00:41:42,755
It is exactly what I suggested!

470
00:41:43,075 --> 00:41:46,595
But a silly woman threw her in the water!

471
00:41:48,155 --> 00:41:51,635
I was the one who threw her in the water.

472
00:41:51,955 --> 00:41:55,795
That's good presence of mind!
That's the right cure.

473
00:41:56,515 --> 00:41:58,795
It could've been worse had
you wrapped her in a blanket.

474
00:41:58,835 --> 00:41:59,955
And wasted a blanket, too!

475
00:42:00,675 --> 00:42:05,635
Is she the new governess?
She seems to be a sensible lady.

476
00:42:09,355 --> 00:42:13,835
Should I appoint her then?
Haven't you already? Go ahead!

477
00:42:18,195 --> 00:42:22,315
Send someone for these
medicines and ointments.

478
00:42:26,075 --> 00:42:32,555
Be careful the next time.
Use grandpa for rocket-firing!

479
00:42:36,675 --> 00:42:39,315
Have you spoken to Janki?

480
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:42,835
Yes. I'll let you know soon.

481
00:42:47,115 --> 00:42:49,915
What did you say your name was?
Laxmi.

482
00:42:52,555 --> 00:42:57,915
Employ her. And discuss
the salary with her.

483
00:43:00,795 --> 00:43:02,595
He's employed her!
What happens of me?

484
00:43:03,235 --> 00:43:06,155
Don't whisper! Bloody cheat!

485
00:43:10,995 --> 00:43:13,235
As I was saying, sir...

486
00:43:19,795 --> 00:43:22,955
Thanks for saving my child.

487
00:43:23,675 --> 00:43:26,275
She's my child, too.

488
00:43:27,315 --> 00:43:29,155
You were God sent for me.

489
00:43:30,195 --> 00:43:32,035
And I couldn't even make out.

490
00:43:35,995 --> 00:43:38,955
Can I call you aunty?

491
00:43:41,835 --> 00:43:43,515
Consider this to be your own house.

492
00:43:44,675 --> 00:43:47,475
You can even stay here. Okay?

493
00:43:47,715 --> 00:43:51,355
No! I must go home
every evening!

494
00:43:51,515 --> 00:43:53,115
What for?
It's the make-up.

495
00:43:54,355 --> 00:43:57,475
What?!
The family make-up.

496
00:43:57,715 --> 00:44:00,475
When will I do the chores?
There's so much to do.

497
00:44:00,835 --> 00:44:03,795
Okay. Take Bharti upstairs.

498
00:44:04,955 --> 00:44:08,235
And the bedroom...
is to the right upstairs.

499
00:44:08,955 --> 00:44:10,195
How did you know?

500
00:44:11,755 --> 00:44:17,635
The science of placement!
That's how it is, isn't it?

501
00:44:18,435 --> 00:44:19,875
It's to the right!

502
00:44:20,675 --> 00:44:23,355
Janki...
Yes, Papa? ...Go on ahead.

503
00:44:28,115 --> 00:44:30,435
Get ready. We've got to go
to the office.

504
00:44:35,395 --> 00:44:38,475
Have you noticed aunt Laxmi, Papa?

505
00:44:38,795 --> 00:44:42,035
Doesn't she look...
She's just like your mother.

506
00:44:43,235 --> 00:44:44,915
Isn't that right?
Yes.

507
00:44:55,155 --> 00:44:56,875
Does it hurt, dear?
Yes.

508
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:02,955
What day is it today?
It's a good Friday.

509
00:45:03,595 --> 00:45:09,795
How did you know that?
Because we meet today.

510
00:45:10,995 --> 00:45:15,035
It's always a great Friday
when I meet my Papa, you know?

511
00:45:15,555 --> 00:45:16,755
I see.

512
00:45:19,835 --> 00:45:21,635
Papa!

513
00:45:24,715 --> 00:45:26,555
Call me aunt.
Papa!

514
00:45:30,715 --> 00:45:34,195
My darling dad...
who'd eat anything!

515
00:45:39,515 --> 00:45:42,355
My darling dad...
who'd eat anything!

516
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,395
My little darling...
so plump and lovely!

517
00:45:49,475 --> 00:45:51,555
Who's that?
What's happening to her?

518
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:55,635
Nothing. She has
an upset tummy.

519
00:45:56,075 --> 00:46:00,235
Yes. I have an upset tummy!
Wait a minute...

520
00:46:01,155 --> 00:46:05,555
You'll be fine. The doctor's
given an ointment for your burns.

521
00:46:20,035 --> 00:46:23,395
You're a real wizard, Papa!

522
00:46:23,435 --> 00:46:25,635
Not Papa. Call me aunty.

523
00:46:48,235 --> 00:46:51,155
A great clash, eh?

524
00:46:51,915 --> 00:46:53,555
Sorry. I've run into you.

525
00:46:53,795 --> 00:46:55,675
Your sari hit me actually!

526
00:46:57,395 --> 00:46:59,275
What is your name?

527
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:05,195
Laxmi Godbole.
Great name.

528
00:47:05,795 --> 00:47:06,955
But what are you doing here?

529
00:47:08,595 --> 00:47:12,035
I have to come here for Jai's kid.

530
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:15,315
No kid up there. His wife
has taken her away.

531
00:47:15,515 --> 00:47:17,995
They've separated, you see.
Jai's a kid, too.

532
00:47:18,755 --> 00:47:21,915
I cook for the poor boy since
his wife has left him.

533
00:47:21,955 --> 00:47:26,835
So you're his cooker, eh?
No. I'm the "cookie"!

534
00:47:27,915 --> 00:47:29,795
That's great.
But Jai's not at home.

535
00:47:30,035 --> 00:47:31,915
I know.
How did you know?

536
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:34,595
You told me so just now.

537
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:39,035
What will you cook,
now that Jai's not there?

538
00:47:39,755 --> 00:47:44,035
I don't cook Jai.
I cook "for" Jai!

539
00:47:44,955 --> 00:47:47,435
Hey, listen...!

540
00:47:47,675 --> 00:47:51,435
There's a girl up there.
She's waiting for Jai!

541
00:47:51,715 --> 00:47:54,315
What a hurricane of a woman!

542
00:47:59,995 --> 00:48:01,355
Ratna? Who are you?

543
00:48:02,395 --> 00:48:04,595
How did you know my name?

544
00:48:04,995 --> 00:48:07,115
It's...
Jai?

545
00:48:08,235 --> 00:48:13,315
Yes. Jai told me.
That it's only Ratna who...

546
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:15,395
What else did he tell you about me?

547
00:48:15,955 --> 00:48:17,035
Just that...

548
00:48:17,515 --> 00:48:22,315
...you work in films as an
assistant dance director.

549
00:48:24,195 --> 00:48:25,955
But who are you?

550
00:48:26,355 --> 00:48:29,795
I'm Jai's Laxmi...
He has kept me.

551
00:48:30,235 --> 00:48:33,675
What?
To cook for him!

552
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:37,835
How did you come here?
I took an autorickshaw.

553
00:48:38,075 --> 00:48:41,035
Had you some work?
I asked her, too!

554
00:48:41,915 --> 00:48:45,635
But she said it's personal.
She will tell only Jai!

555
00:48:45,915 --> 00:48:48,075
Why have you come after me?

556
00:48:48,795 --> 00:48:52,075
I have some doubts about you, madam.

557
00:48:52,355 --> 00:48:56,315
I've got to ask you something.
What is it?

558
00:48:56,595 --> 00:49:03,595
You're a Brahmin who's here
to cook for Jai, right?

559
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:10,235
But Jai is a non-vegetarian!
How will a Brahmin cook that?

560
00:49:11,035 --> 00:49:15,275
That's between Jai and me.
Why must you interfere?

561
00:49:15,315 --> 00:49:18,595
Okay. I have
something else to say.

562
00:49:19,395 --> 00:49:23,075
What is it?
That's between Jai and me!

563
00:49:23,395 --> 00:49:25,355
I'll tell Jai, of course!

564
00:49:28,515 --> 00:49:30,555
Atleast you tell me, Ratna.

565
00:49:30,995 --> 00:49:32,675
I will speak to Jai, too.

566
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:37,595
Okay. Sit here and wait
for Jai. I'm off for a bath.

567
00:49:37,915 --> 00:49:41,315
Don't bathe in the evening! You
could have a chest-congestion!

568
00:49:42,675 --> 00:49:46,395
We Brahmins always bathe before we cook.

569
00:49:47,835 --> 00:49:51,635
Great woman! She observes
cleanliness even at this age!

570
00:50:12,395 --> 00:50:14,915
You bathe everyday, don't you?
What do you mean?

571
00:50:15,355 --> 00:50:17,555
I mean, it's good to bathe everyday!

572
00:50:22,995 --> 00:50:28,435
Wow! She is even religious...
What a chaste woman!

573
00:51:23,395 --> 00:51:25,355
Jai! What are you up to?

574
00:51:26,035 --> 00:51:33,035
The water wouldn't flow
the drain! So I came down!

575
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:44,635
Jai! What's that?

576
00:51:46,515 --> 00:51:48,955
You're wearing a matrimonial necklace!

577
00:51:51,795 --> 00:51:55,195
It belonged to my mother.
When she died...

578
00:51:55,435 --> 00:51:59,395
my father asked me to
preserve it carefully.

579
00:51:59,435 --> 00:52:03,075
And what's that...
on your forehead?

580
00:52:03,555 --> 00:52:06,115
Eyebrows, eh?
It's a dot!

581
00:52:08,235 --> 00:52:12,235
This doesn't belong to Mom.
Aunty gave it to me and said...

582
00:52:13,115 --> 00:52:16,475
"You have a necklace. Complete
the picture with a dot"!

583
00:52:16,755 --> 00:52:18,915
You must wear it on your forehead.

584
00:52:25,715 --> 00:52:31,755
Jai! I'm here too! Talk to me,
when you're through with her!

585
00:52:34,475 --> 00:52:36,875
What is it, Haribhai?
I was terribly sorry...

586
00:52:37,075 --> 00:52:38,595
to hear of your mother's death.

587
00:52:39,035 --> 00:52:43,675
When? Oh yes... just now!
She's dead, isn't she?

588
00:52:44,115 --> 00:52:45,675
Absolutely!
But that's an old story.

589
00:52:45,915 --> 00:52:48,275
There's something new.
She's here.

590
00:52:48,755 --> 00:52:49,915
Who's that?
Aunty!

591
00:52:50,115 --> 00:52:53,635
I know that.
How did you know?

592
00:52:54,835 --> 00:52:57,435
You told me just now.
Didn't you?

593
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:59,235
Damn it! I speak a lot!

594
00:52:59,995 --> 00:53:02,275
So what's the important thing
you've got to discuss?

595
00:53:02,635 --> 00:53:05,115
How do you know I had something to discuss?

596
00:53:05,435 --> 00:53:09,035
How? You didn't tell me.

597
00:53:10,075 --> 00:53:13,795
Neither did Haribhai.
But I know it. And how?

598
00:53:14,715 --> 00:53:17,475
The fact that you're here
means it's important!

599
00:53:20,915 --> 00:53:23,315
First drive the Gujju out.

600
00:53:27,315 --> 00:53:32,195
I'll go away. But I must tell
you something before I leave!

601
00:53:34,115 --> 00:53:37,795
You know I'm a widow, don't you, Jai?

602
00:53:38,035 --> 00:53:41,995
What is a man who loses his
wife called? A widow? Right!

603
00:53:42,915 --> 00:53:46,395
I have problems with food in my house.

604
00:53:46,475 --> 00:53:51,635
Could you ask aunty to cook for me, too?

605
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:55,715
How could I do that?
You don't have to cook!

606
00:53:55,915 --> 00:53:58,875
Ask her to cook for me!
It's the same thing!

607
00:54:00,915 --> 00:54:02,995
God! She must have fallen!
I'll take a look!

608
00:54:03,275 --> 00:54:06,675
Where to? Aren't you ashamed
to watch a woman bathing?!

609
00:54:06,995 --> 00:54:08,815
And where are you going?
But I'm a girl, too.

610
00:54:08,955 --> 00:54:10,755
Aunty's not a girl;
She's a woman!

611
00:54:11,075 --> 00:54:15,195
Do something. You stand and
watch, while she falls inside!

612
00:54:15,355 --> 00:54:17,675
I can't even watch...
the doors are shut.

613
00:54:17,875 --> 00:54:20,675
Let me see...
Relax! I'll ask her!

614
00:54:20,755 --> 00:54:23,715
Aunty! What has happened?
Nothing.

615
00:54:24,115 --> 00:54:27,795
What fell inside?
It was my blouse.

616
00:54:28,275 --> 00:54:30,675
A blouse? Did a blouse
make so much of noise?!

617
00:54:30,995 --> 00:54:34,075
Did a blouse make the noise?
I was in the blouse, too!

618
00:54:34,115 --> 00:54:36,595
She was there, too.
I see. That's all right.

619
00:54:36,795 --> 00:54:38,835
You aren't hurt, are you?

620
00:54:39,355 --> 00:54:42,075
I'll tell you, if I'm hurt.

621
00:54:42,475 --> 00:54:44,155
She'll tell us.
Let me take a look.

622
00:54:44,275 --> 00:54:46,555
What are you doing?
Will she cook for me?

623
00:54:46,915 --> 00:54:51,035
What misbehaviour is this!
Go away! Just go away...!

624
00:54:52,435 --> 00:54:55,835
Don't forget! I own the place!
And you owe me the rent!

625
00:54:56,115 --> 00:54:58,555
And you're driving me out!
Don't misunderstand me!

626
00:54:59,115 --> 00:55:02,515
What do they consider
guests to be in India?

627
00:55:02,715 --> 00:55:06,315
They're called guests!
Yes. That's right!

628
00:55:10,355 --> 00:55:13,675
Yes! Guests are like God!

629
00:55:14,195 --> 00:55:16,155
Yes. You're right!

630
00:55:19,515 --> 00:55:20,915
So, what is it?

631
00:55:21,355 --> 00:55:23,635
I've got to know your secret.

632
00:55:24,075 --> 00:55:26,515
Really? What secret?

633
00:55:27,315 --> 00:55:30,115
You're not a dance assistant alone.

634
00:55:31,315 --> 00:55:34,555
Joseph and I share the secret now.

635
00:55:35,515 --> 00:55:37,515
The drunkard has tattled, has he?

636
00:55:37,555 --> 00:55:41,675
Not him. Producer Ranbir
Kapoor told me his.

637
00:55:41,955 --> 00:55:43,595
Does he know about it, too?
Of course.

638
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:45,555
It'll be out in the newspapers tomorrow.

639
00:55:46,075 --> 00:55:48,115
In the newspapers, too?
Yes. I've sent the news!

640
00:55:48,435 --> 00:55:50,595
You're not an assistant director anymore.

641
00:55:50,715 --> 00:55:52,395
You've been promoted.

642
00:55:52,435 --> 00:55:55,555
Jaiprakash Paswan is now an
independent choreographer!

643
00:55:57,315 --> 00:56:01,795
What a cold reaction!
No! It means the same!

644
00:56:05,035 --> 00:56:07,555
Won't you reward me for
the good news I've brought?

645
00:56:07,595 --> 00:56:09,395
What do you want?

646
00:56:09,435 --> 00:56:14,355
Don't you remember?
No! This won't do!

647
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:20,795
What if someone sees us?
You mean aunty?

648
00:56:21,555 --> 00:56:23,155
Yes.

649
00:56:26,835 --> 00:56:29,875
That's how you hurt your own feet!

650
00:56:31,275 --> 00:56:32,635
So let's go...
Okay...

651
00:56:32,995 --> 00:56:34,915
I mean, I've got to go to the loo!

652
00:56:35,955 --> 00:56:37,475
But aunty's using it now.

653
00:56:37,835 --> 00:56:41,075
I'll go after she comes out.
I have a lot to do!

654
00:56:42,955 --> 00:56:46,115
When must I come again?
When I'm not around

655
01:00:13,275 --> 01:00:17,555
This is very soft...
like velvet.

656
01:00:18,395 --> 01:00:21,995
Naturally. It's pure silk.
It cost us 4,000 Rupees.

657
01:00:22,195 --> 01:00:25,155
Sleeping in this is so much fun, as if...

658
01:00:26,275 --> 01:00:28,355
As much fun as it is in your
husband's arms, right?

659
01:00:30,715 --> 01:00:33,155
Don't take of fence. I said
that only because...

660
01:00:33,195 --> 01:00:37,635
I enjoyed the bliss of Cashmere
silk, on a mat with my husband.

661
01:00:38,475 --> 01:00:40,315
Hand me the pillow-cover.

662
01:00:53,915 --> 01:00:58,915
Who's this handsome hiding in your pillow?

663
01:01:01,915 --> 01:01:04,355
Is he your brother?
He seems to be young.

664
01:01:06,675 --> 01:01:09,035
Must be your elder brother then?

665
01:01:11,355 --> 01:01:14,435
Why do you always giggle?
Go away.

666
01:01:19,355 --> 01:01:24,235
He was my husband.
Was? Is he no more?

667
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:26,155
Gosh! Don't say that!

668
01:01:29,395 --> 01:01:31,515
Have you had a drivorsh?

669
01:01:32,435 --> 01:01:37,555
It's "divorce", aunty.
Not drivorsh.

670
01:01:37,995 --> 01:01:39,795
He's pretty good looking.

671
01:01:40,355 --> 01:01:45,755
Looks can be misleading.
Give me that.

672
01:01:46,595 --> 01:01:50,355
May I say something?
A young couple can separate...

673
01:01:50,755 --> 01:01:55,075
but parents must never be done apart.

674
01:01:55,835 --> 01:01:59,995
Never mind that. Go and see
what Bharti is doing.

675
01:02:08,675 --> 01:02:10,475
Let me work!

676
01:02:10,915 --> 01:02:13,875
You're always working.
When do I tickle you then?

677
01:02:14,075 --> 01:02:19,235
This sieve is steaming hot!
It could hurt you.

678
01:02:22,795 --> 01:02:25,515
Well, dear?
What are you doing here?

679
01:02:26,155 --> 01:02:27,995
I came here for a soft-drink.

680
01:02:28,235 --> 01:02:30,995
What are you messing with
the refrigerator for?

681
01:02:31,435 --> 01:02:34,195
I want a fruity.
It's over, I say. Go away.

682
01:02:34,635 --> 01:02:36,915
I want one!
Go away!

683
01:02:39,075 --> 01:02:43,035
Didn't I warn you, dear?
You've burnt your hand now.

684
01:02:45,355 --> 01:02:47,595
Look what has happened, Mom!

685
01:02:47,715 --> 01:02:49,835
Don't disturb me, Bharti.
Let me work.

686
01:02:50,435 --> 01:02:53,675
Aunty! See what's
wrong with Bharti.

687
01:02:59,795 --> 01:03:01,875
So what's wrong?

688
01:03:05,635 --> 01:03:09,275
What happened?
Kaushalya has burnt my hand.

689
01:03:11,555 --> 01:03:14,155
Burnt you, did she?!
But what happened?

690
01:03:14,595 --> 01:03:18,875
She burnt Banwa first and then me, too.

691
01:03:19,075 --> 01:03:22,355
Banwa? What was
he doing there?

692
01:03:22,515 --> 01:03:28,115
He was only tickling her.
I see.

693
01:03:28,715 --> 01:03:32,635
What I saw was the night-show;
He's into the matinees now!

694
01:03:33,155 --> 01:03:36,875
Let's apply some ointment...
Why did you go there anyway?

695
01:03:36,915 --> 01:03:41,035
I went for a soft-drink and she
didn't let me open the fridge.

696
01:03:41,355 --> 01:03:44,395
The thief? She must have
had it herself.

697
01:03:45,075 --> 01:03:50,555
She's stolen so much already.
Is that the truth?

698
01:03:50,635 --> 01:03:51,955
Of course.

699
01:03:53,595 --> 01:03:56,835
All right.
Papa will set it right!

700
01:03:57,035 --> 01:03:59,635
Aunt will set it right, you mean!

701
01:04:00,355 --> 01:04:03,395
Well... Aunt will!

702
01:04:11,155 --> 01:04:13,075
Back to the table, Bharti.

703
01:04:21,675 --> 01:04:24,795
I've got an order for 50000
pairs of shoes from Italy, sir.

704
01:04:24,875 --> 01:04:28,155
The manager has left his file.
Good.

705
01:04:29,315 --> 01:04:31,675
But he said we can't execute the order.

706
01:04:31,875 --> 01:04:35,235
Why not?
Slaying animals is tough...

707
01:04:35,395 --> 01:04:37,395
thanks to the animal protection groups.

708
01:04:37,515 --> 01:04:42,035
They're protesting atrocities
against animals in the Capital.

709
01:04:42,475 --> 01:04:46,395
You'll get a shock, Bharti.
Kaushalya... you switch it on.

710
01:04:55,675 --> 01:05:00,995
"Listen to the secret news from Bharti"

711
01:05:01,395 --> 01:05:07,715
"There are many thefts taking
place at No. 10, Juhu Scheme"

712
01:05:08,355 --> 01:05:11,395
"Our reporter, Aunty, is
investigating the robberies"

713
01:05:12,315 --> 01:05:15,195
"We present a special report"

714
01:06:00,235 --> 01:06:02,555
You even steal!
That's not me!

715
01:06:02,795 --> 01:06:06,235
They're playing such dirty
tricks on film stars, too!

716
01:06:06,435 --> 01:06:11,715
The aunt is jealous of me!
You mustn't say that, dear!

717
01:06:11,955 --> 01:06:15,715
This is only a trailer.
Had I shot the whole show...

718
01:06:15,755 --> 01:06:18,795
...we'd have had
a video-library!

719
01:06:18,995 --> 01:06:20,235
You're lying!

720
01:06:20,355 --> 01:06:23,595
Stop this nonsense!
Let me talk to her, sir.

721
01:06:23,835 --> 01:06:25,915
Well, Kaushi?
Why did you do that?

722
01:06:26,035 --> 01:06:32,475
You dare steal here, Kaushalya!
Impudent woman!

723
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:36,435
Dangerous woman, sir!
She's playing the Bandit Queen!

724
01:06:36,795 --> 01:06:39,875
You, too?
Shut up! Who else, if not I?!

725
01:06:39,955 --> 01:06:43,115
The neighbours won't ask
if my house is robbed!

726
01:06:45,955 --> 01:06:52,355
I ran out of battery, or I'd
have shot the night-scene...

727
01:06:52,395 --> 01:06:56,435
The day-scene is all so obvious!
Why'd we need night-scenes?

728
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:58,835
Call the police, Banwa.

729
01:06:58,875 --> 01:07:02,195
That's not necessary, sir!
I'll personally throw her out!

730
01:07:02,355 --> 01:07:07,715
Shameless creature! You dare
bite the hand that feeds!

731
01:07:07,835 --> 01:07:10,515
Will you do all that in my presence, Banwa!

732
01:07:10,635 --> 01:07:13,435
Yes. The garden is the
ideal place. Let's go...

733
01:07:13,555 --> 01:07:16,555
The plate, Banwa...
Sure. Clap on!

734
01:07:17,115 --> 01:07:20,275
I said, the plate.
...that you're holding.

735
01:07:24,435 --> 01:07:30,715
Get out! This home is
temple for us! Right?

736
01:07:30,955 --> 01:07:32,555
You're right, sir.

737
01:07:33,035 --> 01:07:36,675
Go on... don't mind this!
Go away!

738
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:41,195
Let me not see you around again!

739
01:07:41,435 --> 01:07:45,075
Thanks, Laxmi.
You have awakened us today.

740
01:07:45,155 --> 01:07:47,515
I wonder how many thieves we have at home!

741
01:07:47,675 --> 01:07:53,315
She'll play Alibaba and drive
away the thieves, grandpa.

742
01:07:54,515 --> 01:07:56,995
I threw her out of the gate, sir!

743
01:07:57,195 --> 01:08:00,195
I'd throw her out of town, if I could.

744
01:08:00,395 --> 01:08:03,075
I'll find another maid in a couple of days.

745
01:08:03,395 --> 01:08:09,635
Why a maid? Why not a male?
We can find a good cook.

746
01:08:09,995 --> 01:08:13,995
With a maid around, maybe...
You win, aunt!

747
01:08:14,475 --> 01:08:19,155
A male would be perfect.
I'll find a cook soon.

748
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:22,955
That's okay.
What do we eat till then?

749
01:08:23,035 --> 01:08:29,435
I'll cook. I did it
for 5 years in my house.

750
01:08:29,835 --> 01:08:33,075
No thank you. You people have
been flesh-eaters!

751
01:08:33,315 --> 01:08:35,555
You must help her, Laxmi.

752
01:08:35,795 --> 01:08:38,835
I can't stand the smell
of flesh in this house!

753
01:08:39,195 --> 01:08:42,435
Go to the market with her.
Very well.

754
01:08:45,475 --> 01:08:50,035
What's so funny?
You're always giggling!

755
01:09:13,875 --> 01:09:16,155
But they're tomatoes!

756
01:09:16,395 --> 01:09:20,275
I suggested we go to the
air-conditioned and clean Foodland.

757
01:09:20,475 --> 01:09:23,635
But Aunt had to insist...

758
01:09:24,395 --> 01:09:28,355
It's not good to buy vegetables
from such a dirty place, aunt.

759
01:09:28,435 --> 01:09:30,555
We have you with us for safety, don't we?

760
01:09:33,315 --> 01:09:35,555
Would you like some ladyfinger?

761
01:09:36,195 --> 01:09:40,755
Go and get some bunches of
fenugreek from there, aunt.

762
01:09:41,075 --> 01:09:43,235
Why must you need something so bitter?

763
01:09:43,435 --> 01:09:47,195
Papa loves it, aunt.
Give it to him everyday...

764
01:09:47,355 --> 01:09:50,555
and he'll will all his property to you.

765
01:09:50,675 --> 01:09:54,395
If only fenugreek could get his property...

766
01:09:57,115 --> 01:10:01,075
Two kilos each of potatoes,
tomatoes and ladyfinger.

767
01:10:01,915 --> 01:10:05,715
Has Uncle spoken to you?
About what?

768
01:10:05,795 --> 01:10:09,635
About us, that is...
Could we have some gourd?

769
01:10:10,795 --> 01:10:12,955
What insolence is this?!

770
01:10:13,195 --> 01:10:14,635
Was that insolence?

771
01:10:14,995 --> 01:10:18,755
What d'you think you're doing?
No English, feller!

772
01:10:18,915 --> 01:10:22,355
You need a slap to rid you
of your shamelessness!

773
01:10:22,555 --> 01:10:25,675
Don't mess with him.
Let's move.

774
01:10:25,915 --> 01:10:28,355
He held my hand!
And you talk of going away!

775
01:10:28,515 --> 01:10:35,155
Talk to me, lady!
Never mind this chap.

776
01:10:35,635 --> 01:10:38,995
Are you a cop?
Talk to this man!

777
01:10:39,275 --> 01:10:42,515
She's like your sister...
Your sister maybe!

778
01:10:42,675 --> 01:10:45,115
To me, she looks like
a ravishing film-star!

779
01:10:45,235 --> 01:10:48,755
Don't touch me. Or else...
I haven't yet. But here goes!

780
01:10:54,755 --> 01:10:58,315
I'll show you now...!
Let me see what you have.

781
01:10:59,235 --> 01:11:02,195
Let go of my hand!
Let go of her hand first.

782
01:11:08,795 --> 01:11:10,315
Go away, Janki.

783
01:11:11,155 --> 01:11:12,715
Come along, aunty!

784
01:11:13,395 --> 01:11:15,435
Take the doctor and leave!

785
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:19,555
Take Mom away, Bharti!

786
01:11:19,915 --> 01:11:22,075
Let's go, Mom! Please!

787
01:11:27,355 --> 01:11:30,555
I'm about to lose my temper!
Let go of my hand!

788
01:11:30,875 --> 01:11:33,835
No one dares touch me here!
Bloody rat!

789
01:11:34,035 --> 01:11:41,035
You can touch women!
But women can't touch you, eh?

790
01:11:43,995 --> 01:11:50,795
I want to ask your Mom what she
ate before delivering you!

791
01:11:52,075 --> 01:11:54,355
Shera! Ashok! Kaliya!

792
01:12:02,195 --> 01:12:06,035
I spare you because you're
a woman. Or else...

793
01:12:12,515 --> 01:12:14,675
Don't just stand here!
Split!

794
01:12:15,555 --> 01:12:17,315
Where to? Come here!

795
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:21,195
Don't stand and watch!
Get her!

796
01:13:34,675 --> 01:13:38,275
Bravo, aunt!
That was wonderful!

797
01:15:46,355 --> 01:15:48,595
Maa!
Remember your Maa now?

798
01:15:49,315 --> 01:15:54,155
Always remember her, before
you touch another woman.

799
01:15:55,835 --> 01:15:59,075
You can even remember me.
Sure, Mom!

800
01:15:59,675 --> 01:16:01,995
Call me "aunt"...not Mom!

801
01:16:24,315 --> 01:16:26,955
You were great, young lady!

802
01:16:44,315 --> 01:16:48,435
Thank you, Laxmi.
What for? This is my duty.

803
01:16:49,155 --> 01:16:53,115
Not for the juice. You did me
a great favour yesterday.

804
01:16:53,955 --> 01:17:00,955
You have protected my children
like a member of the family.

805
01:17:04,675 --> 01:17:06,675
They're dear to me, too.

806
01:17:07,595 --> 01:17:13,435
Anything could have happened,
if you were not there.

807
01:17:14,395 --> 01:17:16,755
The worthless doctor just fled!

808
01:17:17,315 --> 01:17:20,475
And I was thinking of getting
him married to Janki.

809
01:17:20,995 --> 01:17:27,435
I've changed my mind! The
doctor does not deserve Janki!

810
01:17:28,195 --> 01:17:32,315
Have you asked Janki too?

811
01:17:33,235 --> 01:17:35,635
Why ask her?
She has no sense either.

812
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:40,435
Maybe she loves him.

813
01:17:40,995 --> 01:17:44,435
She was in love with that
idiot of a film-man too!

814
01:17:44,635 --> 01:17:45,915
But what happened?

815
01:17:46,315 --> 01:17:52,275
She ran away from the
home and me, you know?

816
01:17:52,955 --> 01:17:57,915
But I didn't give up!
I have brought her back!

817
01:18:00,435 --> 01:18:02,715
And that, too, after she has a child!

818
01:18:02,955 --> 01:18:06,715
I see... but how did you
accomplish all this?

819
01:18:10,755 --> 01:18:17,475
One has to apply his mind
for the children's welfare.

820
01:18:19,115 --> 01:18:26,115
One cannot live on love alone.
One needs money.

821
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:30,955
One needs comforts...

822
01:18:33,315 --> 01:18:36,995
And luxuries, too.

823
01:18:39,635 --> 01:18:42,995
What happened?
My heart...

824
01:18:53,355 --> 01:18:56,315
Janki! Janki!

825
01:20:19,515 --> 01:20:23,475
I want a truck-load of flowers.
Have the house washed...

826
01:20:24,195 --> 01:20:27,675
Have the boss's white attire ironed.

827
01:20:28,075 --> 01:20:30,755
And I want 200 kgs of ice...
That's a must!

828
01:20:31,035 --> 01:20:33,355
We'll lay the boss's body on that...

829
01:20:33,515 --> 01:20:37,115
or his body will stink till
his brother arrives from Nepal.

830
01:20:37,715 --> 01:20:42,155
He must be given a
National Hero's farewell!

831
01:20:42,595 --> 01:20:45,195
He is leaving us so much!

832
01:20:48,595 --> 01:20:53,035
I'll ask his daughter and let
you know more. Hang on.

833
01:20:54,715 --> 01:20:58,155
What happened?
Everything is fine.

834
01:20:59,595 --> 01:21:01,475
Call off everything!

835
01:21:01,875 --> 01:21:04,715
Bless aunt! The worst
could have happened...

836
01:21:05,115 --> 01:21:07,395
...if she had not rushed you
here on time.

837
01:21:07,715 --> 01:21:11,035
She carried you all the way
as if you were a child!

838
01:21:11,955 --> 01:21:15,915
You ought to take part
in the Olympics, aunt!

839
01:21:16,475 --> 01:21:19,675
India would be assured
of at least one gold medal.

840
01:21:20,115 --> 01:21:24,275
Never mind that, doctor.
Is the master okay now?

841
01:21:24,435 --> 01:21:25,715
He's absolutely fine.

842
01:21:27,835 --> 01:21:31,795
Aunty! How will I...

843
01:21:41,195 --> 01:21:43,155
Why are you making her cry?
Leave her alone.

844
01:21:45,795 --> 01:21:50,355
Ask the doctor when we can
take the boss home, dear.

845
01:21:50,755 --> 01:21:54,835
Today itself. And Dr. Rohit
is around for help, too.

846
01:21:57,435 --> 01:22:01,195
Let's go home, uncle.
Get well soon.

847
01:22:01,995 --> 01:22:05,955
We've got a lot to decide.
No, Rohit.

848
01:22:07,155 --> 01:22:09,715
You're a good doctor, I know.

849
01:22:10,235 --> 01:22:16,675
But let's leave it at that.
What do you say, Laxmi?

850
01:22:29,515 --> 01:22:32,635
Place some money in aunt's plate, grandpa.

851
01:22:33,635 --> 01:22:35,635
Why do I need to do that, dear?

852
01:22:36,115 --> 01:22:39,275
After all that she has done for us...

853
01:22:39,915 --> 01:22:42,435
...we ought to give her
the keys of the family.

854
01:22:42,915 --> 01:22:46,675
Use keys on locks, sir.
Place some change in it now.

855
01:22:49,795 --> 01:22:53,115
Treat that like a golden
biscuit! Come on, sir...

856
01:23:01,995 --> 01:23:05,915
I'll take that.
Coming, sir.

857
01:23:10,035 --> 01:23:11,235
Did you call me?

858
01:23:13,795 --> 01:23:20,475
I've been alone for 20 years,
after Lajwanti's death.

859
01:23:21,715 --> 01:23:25,835
I have never missed female
company in all these years.

860
01:23:26,155 --> 01:23:33,115
You have served me so well now, Lakshi!

861
01:23:34,195 --> 01:23:36,835
I don't think a wife would
have taken so much of care!

862
01:23:40,835 --> 01:23:45,035
See that? My wife wants
just what I wish for.

863
01:23:49,275 --> 01:23:54,435
You must take Lajwanti's
place in this family now.

864
01:24:14,555 --> 01:24:18,715
We clash again! As if we were
separated in our last birth!

865
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:22,435
Jai's waiting for you.

866
01:24:24,955 --> 01:24:27,275
There! I've startled you!

867
01:24:28,435 --> 01:24:32,195
I always say he's not in
and you say you know!

868
01:24:32,555 --> 01:24:34,435
And you say "You've told me"

869
01:24:34,795 --> 01:24:38,035
I've trapped you this time!
He's not in!

870
01:24:38,995 --> 01:24:40,995
I know that.
How did you know?

871
01:24:41,675 --> 01:24:45,835
You just told me so.
Damn it! I'm trapped again!

872
01:25:10,555 --> 01:25:13,195
Laxmi! It's me...!

873
01:25:17,315 --> 01:25:19,875
When did you arrive from outside?

874
01:25:20,955 --> 01:25:23,755
I'm going out.
But when did you arrive?

875
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:29,155
I said I'm going out. Okay?

876
01:25:29,555 --> 01:25:31,435
Why have you locked that aunt in?

877
01:25:32,235 --> 01:25:34,315
Chachi's gone out.

878
01:25:35,155 --> 01:25:37,595
Impossible! I just saw her
coming up the stairs!

879
01:25:37,715 --> 01:25:41,595
This thing about in and out
is a long story, Haribhai.

880
01:25:41,835 --> 01:25:45,235
When aunt went upstairs...
you saw her, I didn't.

881
01:25:45,555 --> 01:25:48,995
And both of us didn't see
when I went upstairs.

882
01:25:49,275 --> 01:25:51,175
How could I see myself?
I'm leaving, after all.

883
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:53,755
But you're watching me
climb down the stairs.

884
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:57,435
But you saw aunt go upstairs, I didn't.

885
01:25:57,875 --> 01:26:00,155
And both of us didn't see her
going downstairs.

886
01:26:00,515 --> 01:26:02,355
Right?
Err? Right, all right.

887
01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:05,995
You'd rather take the left,
and forget the right.

888
01:26:06,235 --> 01:26:09,595
Listen to me...
Yes?

889
01:26:09,955 --> 01:26:12,955
I have something important
to discuss with you.

890
01:26:13,235 --> 01:26:15,675
About the rent?
Forget the rent!

891
01:26:15,915 --> 01:26:18,475
Forget it? Really?
Sure. But I have a condition.

892
01:26:18,795 --> 01:26:20,455
You must do something for me.
What is it?

893
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:24,995
You know I've been alone since
my wife died 20 years ago.

894
01:26:25,635 --> 01:26:29,275
I've never missed female company earlier...

895
01:26:29,475 --> 01:26:31,675
I've heard that one before!

896
01:26:33,035 --> 01:26:34,915
Damn these rickshaw-drivers!

897
01:26:35,355 --> 01:26:37,955
Now listen carefully...
I always do.

898
01:26:38,355 --> 01:26:44,195
That woman and I...
Which woman?

899
01:26:44,435 --> 01:26:48,995
Laxmi... I see my wife
Mangala in her!

900
01:26:49,635 --> 01:26:53,795
She has the same eyes,
same features... same gait!

901
01:26:53,955 --> 01:26:57,915
I swear!
This is an action replay!

902
01:26:58,235 --> 01:27:01,435
Exactly! Everything about her
is an action replay of my wife!

903
01:27:01,675 --> 01:27:07,675
My heart says that too!
Get me my Laxmi! Please!

904
01:27:08,155 --> 01:27:13,715
If Aunt gets to know of this,
she'd be really offended.

905
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:20,995
Not at all! D'you know what
she threw at me today?

906
01:27:22,155 --> 01:27:23,915
This!
The box?

907
01:27:24,955 --> 01:27:29,835
That would break my head!
She threw a rose at me!

908
01:27:31,715 --> 01:27:34,275
Did that fall on you?
On my heart, actually.

909
01:27:36,315 --> 01:27:40,675
Now look; suppose you're
walking down the street...

910
01:27:41,595 --> 01:27:44,515
But I'm standing here.
Just suppose so!

911
01:27:44,995 --> 01:27:48,395
And a crow flying overhead
drops excrement on your head.

912
01:27:49,115 --> 01:27:54,875
Just suppose so! Will you
fall for the crow, too?

913
01:27:56,275 --> 01:28:00,715
What a rotten joke!
A crow and Laxmi, eh?

914
01:28:01,035 --> 01:28:04,875
I'll throw you out!
Just listen...

915
01:28:05,075 --> 01:28:06,735
She's terribly angry with Durgaprasad...

916
01:28:06,835 --> 01:28:08,515
...which is why she
threw the rose at you.

917
01:28:08,595 --> 01:28:11,315
Durgaprasad? Now who
the hell is that?

918
01:28:12,355 --> 01:28:15,395
I'm trapped...
Her brother-in-law, eh?

919
01:28:16,915 --> 01:28:20,435
Not her brother-in-law.
He's her husband.

920
01:28:21,675 --> 01:28:26,675
She said she was alone! Where
did the husband spring from?

921
01:28:27,715 --> 01:28:30,275
He had left her?
Left her where?

922
01:28:30,635 --> 01:28:33,835
A husband is no baggage
to be carried around!

923
01:28:33,995 --> 01:28:36,395
He's left on a pilgrimage.

924
01:28:36,435 --> 01:28:40,435
That's wonderful! A thorn
out of my path!

925
01:28:41,435 --> 01:28:43,115
But he will return.
How's that?

926
01:28:43,155 --> 01:28:44,835
He has a return ticket.

927
01:28:45,035 --> 01:28:49,955
God! I'll have the railways
cancel his ticket!

928
01:28:50,795 --> 01:28:55,355
I want Laxmi! I've no interest
in life without Laxmi anymore!

929
01:28:55,835 --> 01:29:00,355
Has Kishan paid you his rent?
Not in the last 6 months!

930
01:29:02,795 --> 01:29:06,195
Haribhai? I'm in a hurry...
See you later.

931
01:29:06,475 --> 01:29:11,075
Look after my connection;
I'll go after the collection!

932
01:29:12,595 --> 01:29:16,275
Who's throwing the litter around?

933
01:29:16,995 --> 01:29:19,995
That's no litter...
Siraj!

934
01:29:25,635 --> 01:29:27,275
What are you doing here?
And what's this?

935
01:29:27,595 --> 01:29:29,755
Have you left Grand Hotel?
Yes.

936
01:29:30,035 --> 01:29:33,995
This set-up is my own.
Have you bought it then?

937
01:29:37,995 --> 01:29:40,555
What's that? A Hindu name?

938
01:29:40,675 --> 01:29:44,555
What's in a name? One
must serve tea, after all!

939
01:29:45,115 --> 01:29:47,275
Don't lie!
Shut up!

940
01:29:47,835 --> 01:29:49,755
It's because of you that
he got into trouble.

941
01:29:49,875 --> 01:29:53,715
Where'd he get the 5000 Rupees
he paid your surety from?

942
01:29:56,675 --> 01:30:00,835
Speak the truth! Where did
the 5000 Rupees come from?

943
01:30:08,875 --> 01:30:13,235
I wish I had. They caught me
putting back the money!

944
01:30:13,555 --> 01:30:15,875
You should've told them that
you're putting the money back!

945
01:30:15,955 --> 01:30:20,235
They didn't let me speak!
They chased me and I ran!

946
01:30:20,635 --> 01:30:23,595
But this job is not for you!

947
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:30,155
Ajob is a job, after all!
I only have to earn my living.

948
01:30:32,195 --> 01:30:35,035
Yes. I miss the respect
I got as a chef.

949
01:30:36,475 --> 01:30:39,395
Forget it! I was sick of
the hotel-life anyway.

950
01:30:39,635 --> 01:30:42,555
I'm thinking of joining the movies now.

951
01:30:43,315 --> 01:30:44,915
Get me a role, will you?

952
01:30:45,075 --> 01:30:48,115
If I become a star, I will
soon join politics.

953
01:30:48,355 --> 01:30:50,835
I could even become a minister soon after.

954
01:30:56,155 --> 01:30:59,475
You want to act, don't you?
Of course!

955
01:31:03,355 --> 01:31:05,195
"Killing two birds with one stone"

956
01:31:05,635 --> 01:31:08,635
Wonderful! That's a great
title for a film!

957
01:31:11,035 --> 01:31:14,395
I play the stone, all right.
Who are the birds?

958
01:31:15,275 --> 01:31:17,795
You will play both the roles.
A dual role?!

959
01:31:18,115 --> 01:31:21,435
No. You will play a cook!
A cook even in films?!

960
01:31:21,675 --> 01:31:23,995
There are songs, I hope?

961
01:31:24,715 --> 01:31:27,235
You're going to the in-laws'
place, not for a role.

962
01:31:27,475 --> 01:31:30,075
Why send me there? Will you
have me released?

963
01:31:30,555 --> 01:31:32,675
Not the cop-house!
My in-laws!

964
01:31:33,075 --> 01:31:34,555
They need a cook.

965
01:31:34,835 --> 01:31:38,915
Wow! My head on the block?!
But they're Brahmins!

966
01:31:39,395 --> 01:31:43,075
You must play a Hindu cook,
although you're a Muslim!

967
01:31:43,275 --> 01:31:46,675
And cook what?
Biryani? And paya?

968
01:31:47,235 --> 01:31:50,395
Remove the meat from the rice
and the dish turns vegetarian.

969
01:31:50,795 --> 01:31:55,035
Don't worry. There's a woman
working there, Aunt Laxmi.

970
01:31:55,675 --> 01:31:58,475
She'll take care if you
tell her you're my friend.

971
01:31:58,995 --> 01:32:04,755
Folks there must be highly
educated. If I speak...

972
01:32:06,795 --> 01:32:08,235
Only if you speak, that is.

973
01:32:10,755 --> 01:32:12,315
What does that mean?

974
01:32:14,435 --> 01:32:15,915
Is Babu your name?

975
01:32:17,555 --> 01:32:21,035
What was that "Ba" and "Bu"?
Not numerology, is it?

976
01:32:21,355 --> 01:32:26,915
All he means to say is that
he's been dumb since birth.

977
01:32:27,795 --> 01:32:28,835
I see.

978
01:32:29,675 --> 01:32:34,515
He lost his speech in an
accident 20 years ago.

979
01:32:35,155 --> 01:32:37,315
But you just said he was born dumb!

980
01:32:38,875 --> 01:32:42,595
Yes. He could speak a little
before the mishap...

981
01:32:43,155 --> 01:32:45,915
...but turned absolutely dumb
after the accident.

982
01:32:46,115 --> 01:32:49,275
But he cooks well. He can
prepare any vegetable dish.

983
01:32:50,355 --> 01:32:52,515
Will you cook anything
I write and give you?

984
01:32:52,715 --> 01:32:55,155
Why write?
The poor chap can't speak.

985
01:32:55,395 --> 01:32:59,115
But we can. And he's not deaf.

986
01:33:01,275 --> 01:33:05,955
What's the name?
Shiraj (a Muslim name).

987
01:33:09,595 --> 01:33:11,235
I mean, it's Shivraj.
(a Hindu name).

988
01:33:14,555 --> 01:33:18,875
And what does the other "S" stand for?

989
01:33:22,715 --> 01:33:25,035
Shivraj Sharma.

990
01:33:29,395 --> 01:33:31,075
He cooks well.

991
01:33:32,515 --> 01:33:35,795
Since you're a Brahmin,
you must know the hymns!

992
01:33:36,555 --> 01:33:39,355
We want him to cook, not to
perform a ritual for us!

993
01:33:39,795 --> 01:33:42,235
It's good to know, sir.

994
01:33:43,235 --> 01:33:46,275
You must've been reciting the hymns...

995
01:33:46,475 --> 01:33:50,355
...before the accident, right?
The Gayatri Mantra, too?

996
01:33:51,835 --> 01:33:54,315
You can't speak, all right.
But you must sing for us.

997
01:33:54,715 --> 01:33:56,675
Recite the Gayatri Mantra for us.

998
01:34:08,355 --> 01:34:10,435
That's enough.

999
01:34:12,155 --> 01:34:13,435
Employ him.

1000
01:34:14,115 --> 01:34:17,955
But tell him that we're vegetarians...

1001
01:34:18,475 --> 01:34:21,075
I don't want any flesh or
fish in this household.

1002
01:34:23,355 --> 01:34:25,755
What?
He says...

1003
01:34:28,475 --> 01:34:31,795
...let alone fish, not even a fly
will enter the house! Right?

1004
01:34:33,115 --> 01:34:35,195
Take him inside.

1005
01:34:36,875 --> 01:34:41,235
Mr Sharma... Shivraj Sharma!
Let's go in!

1006
01:34:42,155 --> 01:34:43,955
Aunty...!
Coming.

1007
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:50,675
Where are you?
In here. Give me the towel.

1008
01:35:05,795 --> 01:35:09,395
What are you staring at?
What's wrong?

1009
01:35:12,755 --> 01:35:14,835
It's been days, you know...

1010
01:35:15,755 --> 01:35:20,115
Don't stay in the water for
long. You'll catch a cold.

1011
01:35:47,075 --> 01:35:48,355
What's wrong?

1012
01:35:49,315 --> 01:35:50,795
Nothing. It's me.

1013
01:36:03,555 --> 01:36:06,995
Please fasten this, please.

1014
01:36:18,875 --> 01:36:21,235
What's your size, aunt?

1015
01:36:27,515 --> 01:36:28,675
- 48 C.

1016
01:36:29,755 --> 01:36:31,995
That sounds like a bus number!

1017
01:36:42,195 --> 01:36:45,875
So much of junk! I can't find
a thing in this drawer!

1018
01:36:46,875 --> 01:36:49,195
What are you looking for?
A safety pin!

1019
01:36:56,555 --> 01:36:59,835
Remind me to clear out the mess tomorrow.

1020
01:37:13,755 --> 01:37:19,755
- 5 kilos of gourd... that's what
we call it here in Mumbai.

1021
01:37:22,755 --> 01:37:24,275
What's going on over here?

1022
01:37:26,275 --> 01:37:28,595
Today's the Karva Chauth.
So?

1023
01:37:29,235 --> 01:37:33,435
Women today fast for the long
lives of their husbands.

1024
01:37:33,595 --> 01:37:39,195
You should know all this.
I do. But how am I concerned?

1025
01:37:39,515 --> 01:37:44,195
Oh God! I thought you'd
fast and pray...

1026
01:37:44,435 --> 01:37:46,595
I've called so many other women over.

1027
01:37:46,795 --> 01:37:49,715
Okay. I'll ask them to return.
No. Let them be...

1028
01:37:49,995 --> 01:37:55,075
...since they're here. But ask me
before you do it next time.

1029
01:37:56,395 --> 01:37:59,155
Tea?
No.

1030
01:37:59,675 --> 01:38:02,075
Juice?
I want nothing!

1031
01:38:02,435 --> 01:38:04,795
Can't I stay hungry for a day.

1032
01:38:16,635 --> 01:38:18,555
I can't hear you...

1033
01:38:25,035 --> 01:38:26,155
Just a minute.

1034
01:38:37,395 --> 01:38:39,275
What's going on?

1035
01:38:47,595 --> 01:38:49,995
What is it?
I want to hear Macarena!

1036
01:38:50,155 --> 01:38:52,555
Not now. We have guests.

1037
01:38:54,595 --> 01:38:58,435
You can't be stubborn with me.
Now quietly come downstairs.

1038
01:39:10,675 --> 01:39:14,635
I'm ready. How do I look?

1039
01:39:15,955 --> 01:39:17,835
You always look good.

1040
01:39:33,035 --> 01:39:36,435
Why are you crying?
Mom doesn't listen to me!

1041
01:39:36,795 --> 01:39:40,115
Stop crying and tell me what you want.

1042
01:39:40,795 --> 01:39:43,075
I want to listen to Macarena!

1043
01:39:43,275 --> 01:39:45,755
There's going to be music here soon.

1044
01:39:46,515 --> 01:39:50,475
Their music? Yuck!
I want Macarena!

1045
01:40:01,675 --> 01:40:04,595
Sing the song you sang
the other day, aunty.

1046
01:40:05,075 --> 01:40:08,035
Not today. I have an irritation
in my throat today.

1047
01:40:08,435 --> 01:40:12,315
No one sings a song when
we assemble for it!

1048
01:40:12,475 --> 01:40:15,915
Yes. Some can't sing and some
have a bad throat.

1049
01:40:21,475 --> 01:40:27,515
Sharma! You can't even speak!
How will you sing?

1050
01:40:31,835 --> 01:40:33,835
You sing a song, aunty.

1051
01:40:34,515 --> 01:40:36,555
Yes. Sing for us, Laxmi.

1052
01:41:36,435 --> 01:41:38,995
What was that?
Pali or Sanskrit?

1053
01:41:41,835 --> 01:41:44,075
Explain the meaning of
the song to us, Laxmi.

1054
01:41:44,195 --> 01:41:45,595
Very well.

1055
01:46:28,755 --> 01:46:30,555
It was fun...

1056
01:46:52,275 --> 01:46:55,995
I see you wearing that for the
first time. You look great.

1057
01:46:57,555 --> 01:47:02,435
Is it only for today, or...
Don't get excited, aunt.

1058
01:47:02,995 --> 01:47:06,955
What's a matrimonial necklace
with so many others?

1059
01:47:23,195 --> 01:47:24,795
Aunty...
Yes?

1060
01:47:33,755 --> 01:47:34,835
Yes?

1061
01:47:40,955 --> 01:47:43,515
God! What have you done?

1062
01:47:43,555 --> 01:47:46,115
"The lovers moustache tickles", doesn't it?

1063
01:47:46,395 --> 01:47:48,155
I've shaved it!

1064
01:47:52,035 --> 01:47:55,555
I can see what you want.

1065
01:47:57,115 --> 01:48:00,075
You misunderstand, sir!

1066
01:48:00,275 --> 01:48:03,315
This is... a cross-connection!

1067
01:48:03,955 --> 01:48:07,355
What?
Let me put it plainly.

1068
01:48:08,115 --> 01:48:11,395
What you are dreaming of can never be true!

1069
01:48:11,595 --> 01:48:14,635
But what are you scared of?

1070
01:48:15,475 --> 01:48:18,915
Wouldn't you be scared
if a man proposed to you?

1071
01:48:19,115 --> 01:48:21,235
It's wrong. Cancel it!

1072
01:48:22,195 --> 01:48:25,755
I've had it with Hari once!
Who's Hari?

1073
01:48:26,475 --> 01:48:29,155
Hart's my husband.

1074
01:48:30,435 --> 01:48:36,075
But he's Godbole, isn't he?
True...

1075
01:48:37,035 --> 01:48:40,835
...but I'm married!

1076
01:48:42,315 --> 01:48:46,155
Obviously. But you never
spoke of it. I thought...

1077
01:48:47,155 --> 01:48:50,795
He went away on a pilgrimage ten years ago.

1078
01:48:52,235 --> 01:48:55,275
You never mentioned that.
You never asked either.

1079
01:48:55,475 --> 01:48:57,555
You just thrust a rose in
my hand. What could I do?!

1080
01:48:58,635 --> 01:49:02,995
He's been away for 10 years.
He won't return!

1081
01:49:03,675 --> 01:49:05,595
What if he does?
In that case...

1082
01:49:07,395 --> 01:49:12,835
...I'll get you a divorce.
Have you nothing else to do?

1083
01:49:13,115 --> 01:49:17,955
We can wear as many rings as
we want on our fingers.

1084
01:49:18,235 --> 01:49:20,595
But women wear only one
matrimonial necklace...

1085
01:49:20,795 --> 01:49:27,715
...around their neck.
Laxi! You're not in the mood!

1086
01:49:27,795 --> 01:49:28,995
But that's all right.

1087
01:49:29,995 --> 01:49:33,715
I'll await your answer.

1088
01:49:34,555 --> 01:49:40,795
And I'll wait for my husband!
...my God!

1089
01:49:48,555 --> 01:49:52,595
Aunty! Here comes the
detective for you!

1090
01:50:31,315 --> 01:50:32,755
Hey, wait...!

1091
01:50:32,875 --> 01:50:34,735
I've got to follow the woman!
Not the vehicle!

1092
01:50:38,835 --> 01:50:40,275
Watch where you're going!

1093
01:51:21,555 --> 01:51:24,915
Mister... does the dog bite?
No.

1094
01:51:26,395 --> 01:51:28,195
Out of my way...!

1095
01:51:29,915 --> 01:51:33,315
You said it wouldn't bite!
It's not my dog.

1096
01:51:42,315 --> 01:51:45,035
Laxmi!
Haribhai?!

1097
01:51:45,835 --> 01:51:50,435
Don't call me "bhai" (brother)!
Anything else will do!

1098
01:51:51,675 --> 01:51:54,955
All right. I have something
important to say to you.

1099
01:51:55,115 --> 01:51:57,435
Of course. Come inside...
No. Keep walking...

1100
01:51:58,195 --> 01:52:02,835
You gave me a rose, right?
Did I? When did I?!

1101
01:52:03,115 --> 01:52:06,915
You gave it to Jai. And Jai...
I get it.

1102
01:52:06,955 --> 01:52:11,355
It's between us. Why drag
Jaiprakash into this?

1103
01:52:11,675 --> 01:52:16,155
All right, Hari...
what's wrong?

1104
01:52:16,555 --> 01:52:19,875
Your touch has awoken the music in me!

1105
01:52:20,395 --> 01:52:22,595
That's the background score.
Who was playing it?

1106
01:52:23,675 --> 01:52:26,035
It happens in emotional scenes.
Was it the radio?

1107
01:52:28,035 --> 01:52:29,995
I've got to give you some news.

1108
01:52:30,395 --> 01:52:33,995
Your husband is dead, isn't he?
But don't worry...

1109
01:52:34,515 --> 01:52:36,675
I'm willing to marry a "window"!

1110
01:52:37,315 --> 01:52:40,075
Window?
Aren't you a window now?!

1111
01:52:40,675 --> 01:52:44,675
It's Widow; not window.
Never mind!

1112
01:52:44,715 --> 01:52:50,595
But we will still meet!
No. We will not.

1113
01:52:51,115 --> 01:52:53,555
Two gardeners and a rose.
What?!

1114
01:52:53,595 --> 01:52:57,955
Don't look back.
But that man there...

1115
01:52:58,875 --> 01:53:01,435
The chap with the blue shorts?
Yes.

1116
01:53:01,675 --> 01:53:04,035
Don't worry; the shorts
won't fit him!

1117
01:53:04,235 --> 01:53:06,595
That's his problem!
So?

1118
01:53:06,755 --> 01:53:10,835
He's been following me!
Following you?!

1119
01:53:12,235 --> 01:53:15,675
Don't worry! I'll fix him!
Keep this...

1120
01:53:17,075 --> 01:53:20,995
Make a hole in this
and have it. Okay?

1121
01:53:28,835 --> 01:53:31,795
I'm secretary to Bhardwaj and Bhardwaj...

1122
01:53:32,235 --> 01:53:33,555
...the name is
Banwarilal Pandit.

1123
01:53:34,875 --> 01:53:37,035
Have you seen the woman?
Which woman?

1124
01:53:37,315 --> 01:53:39,715
The well-endowed one.
She was...

1125
01:53:40,515 --> 01:53:42,835
Are you talking about Laxmi?
You know her?

1126
01:53:43,115 --> 01:53:45,915
You are God-sent!
I am God-sent...

1127
01:53:46,355 --> 01:53:50,675
...and I'll give you some of
God's offerings now!

1128
01:53:50,995 --> 01:53:53,555
You tease women in our area!
Hey! What's wrong?

1129
01:53:53,755 --> 01:53:56,395
Have you no womenfolk at home?

1130
01:54:00,235 --> 01:54:01,995
How are you, Shantabai?

1131
01:54:02,995 --> 01:54:04,355
Are they having a fight there?

1132
01:54:04,435 --> 01:54:06,915
Yes. Which is why I've brought
these coconuts for you.

1133
01:54:07,475 --> 01:54:11,235
Make a hole in this and have it.

1134
01:54:11,835 --> 01:54:13,115
I know that.

1135
01:54:17,475 --> 01:54:19,195
But, aunt...

1136
01:54:27,555 --> 01:54:28,435
My God!

1137
01:54:31,835 --> 01:54:34,355
Now look... hear me out!

1138
01:54:43,715 --> 01:54:46,835
Yawning like a princess, eh?
Aren't you ashamed?

1139
01:54:48,315 --> 01:54:50,515
What is this?
A finger. What else?

1140
01:54:50,755 --> 01:54:53,355
Acting smart! Here goes...
That's one finger.

1141
01:54:53,635 --> 01:54:55,315
How many are these?
Two.

1142
01:54:55,515 --> 01:54:59,395
And how many are these?
Your finger is swollen!

1143
01:54:59,675 --> 01:55:03,635
Naturally! I gave you a blow!
But I won't spare you...

1144
01:55:04,195 --> 01:55:06,835
Why are awakening me only to hit me?

1145
01:55:07,075 --> 01:55:09,395
Will you realise it if you're
bashed up unconscious?

1146
01:55:09,635 --> 01:55:11,275
That explains it!
No!

1147
01:55:11,635 --> 01:55:13,755
Call the police!
You're an ill-mannered man!

1148
01:55:14,275 --> 01:55:17,915
No! What are you up to?!
The poor man will die!

1149
01:55:18,195 --> 01:55:21,155
He teases women in our area!
What nonsense?!

1150
01:55:21,395 --> 01:55:25,475
I'm glad you've come!
Save me from this bear!

1151
01:55:25,715 --> 01:55:29,515
You call me a bear?!
Relax...

1152
01:55:29,795 --> 01:55:31,235
See that he doesn't move.

1153
01:55:31,555 --> 01:55:34,555
Sit down there!
What's up, sir?

1154
01:55:36,515 --> 01:55:38,875
Do you know him?
Who is he?

1155
01:55:39,995 --> 01:55:42,675
I could tell you.
But you won't believe me.

1156
01:55:43,035 --> 01:55:47,515
Of course, I will!
He's Laxmi's husband.

1157
01:55:49,675 --> 01:55:51,235
Her husband?!

1158
01:55:53,315 --> 01:56:00,115
No! I can't believe that!
But you just said you would!

1159
01:56:00,475 --> 01:56:02,515
He says his name is Banwari.

1160
01:56:02,755 --> 01:56:04,715
And you said her husband's
name was Durgaprasad!

1161
01:56:05,595 --> 01:56:08,315
Have I told you that, too?
Are there two husbands then?

1162
01:56:08,715 --> 01:56:12,155
Not two husbands.
The husband has two names.

1163
01:56:12,795 --> 01:56:16,235
Laxmi fondly addresses
Durgaprasad as Banwarilal.

1164
01:56:17,035 --> 01:56:19,435
Really?
You can't believe me.

1165
01:56:19,715 --> 01:56:25,035
Try calling Durgaprasad now
using the name Banwarilal.

1166
01:56:28,075 --> 01:56:29,035
Yes?

1167
01:56:30,755 --> 01:56:34,075
Aren't you called Banwarilal?
Yes, sir.

1168
01:56:34,555 --> 01:56:36,835
Banwarilal! Durgaprasad!
Isn't that right?

1169
01:56:37,555 --> 01:56:42,155
Absolutely! I agree it's sad
for you to be separated...

1170
01:56:42,315 --> 01:56:43,715
But I...
That's enough.

1171
01:56:46,635 --> 01:56:48,955
Come here... Laxmi's husband
has had a change.

1172
01:56:49,275 --> 01:56:51,595
Change? With whom?
A change of heart, I mean!

1173
01:56:51,795 --> 01:56:54,115
He wants a compromise.
Nip it in the bud!

1174
01:56:54,435 --> 01:56:57,555
No! How can we interfere?
Then what happens of me?

1175
01:56:57,795 --> 01:57:00,035
What happens of my love?
Just forget her.

1176
01:57:01,275 --> 01:57:02,275
Forget her?
Yes.

1177
01:57:03,195 --> 01:57:04,715
Forget Laxmi, eh?

1178
01:57:05,195 --> 01:57:08,475
How many days since Kishan has paid you?

1179
01:57:09,355 --> 01:57:12,035
He still owes me a thousand
bucks for the last 3 months.

1180
01:57:13,195 --> 01:57:16,475
Why did you ask?
I just saw him going. But...

1181
01:57:16,635 --> 01:57:18,715
Where is he?! Hey Kishan!

1182
01:57:19,675 --> 01:57:23,035
Is that the S.P.'s residence?
Can I speak to him?

1183
01:57:23,675 --> 01:57:25,395
Whom are you calling?
The police, of course.

1184
01:57:25,835 --> 01:57:28,395
No. Please don't!
What are you doing?

1185
01:57:28,515 --> 01:57:29,715
I won't spare that fatso!

1186
01:57:30,035 --> 01:57:32,875
No! Aunt will be dragged to
the police station, too!

1187
01:57:33,275 --> 01:57:34,115
Why will she?

1188
01:57:34,275 --> 01:57:36,955
Because aunty sent him
to give you a thrashing.

1189
01:57:37,435 --> 01:57:41,315
How are they related?
Should I tell you?

1190
01:57:41,995 --> 01:57:44,675
You won't believe me.
Of course, I will.

1191
01:57:45,155 --> 01:57:47,275
That man is her husband.

1192
01:57:48,275 --> 01:57:50,675
Chachi's husband is Godbole;
A Maharashtrian.

1193
01:57:50,875 --> 01:57:52,635
This man is a Gujarati.

1194
01:57:53,355 --> 01:57:57,035
I know. He has converted.
What a shame!

1195
01:57:57,435 --> 01:58:02,235
All said and done, aunty
has a dubious character.

1196
01:58:02,515 --> 01:58:05,075
She's already married to Haribhai...

1197
01:58:05,315 --> 01:58:08,115
...and she's even ensnaring
your father-in-law!

1198
01:58:08,435 --> 01:58:12,515
And that old man too keeps
following her around!

1199
01:58:12,915 --> 01:58:16,635
Then go and tell him what
you have just seen!

1200
01:58:16,875 --> 01:58:21,155
He'll be disgusted and
throw her out. And then...

1201
01:58:21,235 --> 01:58:24,955
You can enjoy ruling your
territory with Kaushalya.

1202
01:58:25,155 --> 01:58:27,715
You can have a free run with
the utensils and valuables!

1203
01:58:28,435 --> 01:58:29,955
How did you know that?

1204
01:58:31,035 --> 01:58:32,435
I saw it on video.

1205
01:58:32,835 --> 01:58:35,395
In that case, it'll
soon be out on cable TV!

1206
01:58:35,995 --> 01:58:37,515
Who gave them the rights?

1207
01:58:37,675 --> 01:58:40,075
Something has to be done
about video piracy!

1208
01:58:40,155 --> 01:58:44,155
Later! First tell your boss
that aunt's husband is back.

1209
01:58:44,275 --> 01:58:46,035
He's back!

1210
01:58:46,995 --> 01:58:51,755
Has he returned from Kashi?
I swear by the cellular, sir!

1211
01:58:51,915 --> 01:58:54,075
You behave as if cellular were God!

1212
01:58:55,555 --> 01:58:58,555
How is he to look at?
He looks mad!

1213
01:58:59,115 --> 01:59:03,395
He has even converted.
His real name is not Godbole...

1214
01:59:03,475 --> 01:59:04,835
It's Hari.

1215
01:59:06,595 --> 01:59:07,915
How did you know that?

1216
01:59:10,755 --> 01:59:14,435
Never mind how I know. But
how do you know all this?

1217
01:59:14,835 --> 01:59:18,595
I was following aunt around.
And why were you following her?

1218
01:59:18,995 --> 01:59:21,915
Everyone was following her.
So I too joined in!

1219
01:59:22,795 --> 01:59:26,115
But that thug caught hold of me alone!

1220
01:59:26,395 --> 01:59:31,075
He gave me a thrashing and
even a mad-dog bit me!

1221
01:59:31,195 --> 01:59:33,875
But I didn't let anything
happen to your cellular!

1222
01:59:34,755 --> 01:59:37,795
What happened then?
The dear son-in-law arrived.

1223
01:59:38,955 --> 01:59:42,635
Dear, my foot! It was
that buffoon, Jaiprakash!

1224
01:59:43,035 --> 01:59:46,275
How did he get there?
He was passing by...

1225
01:59:46,715 --> 01:59:48,395
...and he was the one
who saved me.

1226
01:59:49,115 --> 01:59:55,155
I asked him not to stick to me
and to keep his distance!

1227
01:59:55,755 --> 01:59:58,995
But aunt hasn't a very good character, sir.

1228
01:59:59,475 --> 02:00:03,035
To begin with, there is
confusion over her husband.

1229
02:00:03,435 --> 02:00:08,355
What is worse, she had lots
of fun in a gents toilet!

1230
02:00:10,075 --> 02:00:11,195
This aunt...

1231
02:00:13,395 --> 02:00:16,395
Aunty! You have a long life!

1232
02:00:16,875 --> 02:00:21,555
I've been praising you!
But not in your presence, no!

1233
02:00:21,875 --> 02:00:25,315
I'll order the car to take you
to the jewellers, sir.

1234
02:00:25,515 --> 02:00:27,715
What's that on your forehead?
Must be wrinkles.

1235
02:00:28,395 --> 02:00:30,755
The marks above the wrinkles?

1236
02:00:30,875 --> 02:00:35,075
It hurt yesterday...
it shows today!

1237
02:00:41,995 --> 02:00:45,995
I'm going to buy some jewellery
for Janki and Bharti.

1238
02:00:46,675 --> 02:00:48,195
Why don't you come along, too?

1239
02:00:49,275 --> 02:00:50,595
What would I do there?

1240
02:00:50,915 --> 02:00:54,355
You're a member of this
family, too. Come along.

1241
02:00:54,395 --> 02:00:55,875
Grandpa! Hurry up!

1242
02:00:56,075 --> 02:01:01,595
Yes, I'm coming, Janki!
You must come, too.

1243
02:01:10,395 --> 02:01:12,435
Your laughter will give my game away!

1244
02:01:12,475 --> 02:01:15,555
No way! No one knows
what I know.

1245
02:01:15,675 --> 02:01:17,755
Stop it now!

1246
02:01:24,795 --> 02:01:27,395
Do you like this?
Very much.

1247
02:01:30,915 --> 02:01:34,435
Mom is buying so much.
Don't you want anything?

1248
02:01:34,555 --> 02:01:35,955
No.
Why not?

1249
02:01:36,275 --> 02:01:41,515
Mom's Dad has lots of money.
My Papa has nothing.

1250
02:01:42,675 --> 02:01:49,075
Who says? I have enough.
I'm now a choreographer.

1251
02:01:49,795 --> 02:01:54,515
I have wads in my shorts.
Buy anything you wish.

1252
02:01:55,035 --> 02:01:57,715
No. Not now.
We'll come later.

1253
02:02:02,755 --> 02:02:08,475
I'll pay you 150 in cash and
a cheque of 300. Okay?

1254
02:02:08,755 --> 02:02:11,115
No, sir. I'm sorry, we can't
give it to you. Go away.

1255
02:02:11,275 --> 02:02:12,955
But...
Please go away.

1256
02:02:16,835 --> 02:02:20,595
Great stuff...
I'm sorry, madam!

1257
02:02:23,955 --> 02:02:24,835
Jai! You?

1258
02:02:26,555 --> 02:02:28,835
I'm not Jai! I'm Laxmi!

1259
02:02:37,115 --> 02:02:40,995
My wife gave me 300 Rupees for an anklet...

1260
02:02:41,155 --> 02:02:46,875
I blew up half of it at
the liquor-den on my way!

1261
02:02:47,515 --> 02:02:49,595
He's not willing to give it to me at 150.

1262
02:02:49,795 --> 02:02:52,675
So lend me 150 bucks if you have it...

1263
02:02:52,915 --> 02:02:54,595
No. I don't have the money!

1264
02:02:55,835 --> 02:03:00,555
Don't lie, you wretch!
Cough it up!

1265
02:03:00,955 --> 02:03:04,075
I have the money in my shorts.
But I can't get it out!

1266
02:03:04,395 --> 02:03:08,835
Can't you? You must have
some change here or there.

1267
02:03:11,675 --> 02:03:14,155
Let me have it, or I'll myself get it...

1268
02:03:15,235 --> 02:03:18,755
What misbehaviour is that
with a woman? Who are you?

1269
02:03:18,955 --> 02:03:22,395
Wonderful! You ask me!
Who the hell are you?

1270
02:03:22,915 --> 02:03:25,955
Want to know who he is?
No.

1271
02:03:27,595 --> 02:03:28,595
I mean, yes!

1272
02:03:28,955 --> 02:03:35,715
Yes? He has returned from
the pilgrimage! My husband!

1273
02:03:36,955 --> 02:03:39,315
Disgusting! He's drunk
so early in the day!

1274
02:03:39,515 --> 02:03:41,915
I didn't know Hari was a drunkard.

1275
02:03:42,315 --> 02:03:44,795
Who's this third party?

1276
02:03:45,275 --> 02:03:49,395
I'd any day challenge him
to a bout of drinking!

1277
02:03:49,515 --> 02:03:51,755
My name is Joseph.

1278
02:03:54,395 --> 02:03:59,075
You have converted again!
Damn you! The things you do!

1279
02:04:00,235 --> 02:04:04,155
He's drunk on credit and
he's asking me for money.

1280
02:04:04,355 --> 02:04:08,355
Send him away with some money,
if you're carrying it. Please!

1281
02:04:08,875 --> 02:04:11,795
Here you are... and get out!

1282
02:04:12,835 --> 02:04:14,395
Give me another 50 bucks...

1283
02:04:14,875 --> 02:04:20,355
Hey, this is 500 Rupees!
I asked only for 150!

1284
02:04:20,995 --> 02:04:24,915
What nonsense is that?
Okay; you're her husband...

1285
02:04:24,955 --> 02:04:27,755
...but you can't behave
like that publicly!

1286
02:04:28,195 --> 02:04:29,795
You have the money now!
Get lost!

1287
02:04:29,835 --> 02:04:31,995
Very well. I'll go away.

1288
02:04:45,475 --> 02:04:49,635
Drink to your heart's content, Joseph.

1289
02:04:50,515 --> 02:04:54,315
You asked for a hundred
thousand Rupees, sir...

1290
02:04:54,515 --> 02:04:55,715
That's for me!
Relax!

1291
02:04:56,155 --> 02:04:57,755
Are you starting a new business?
No.

1292
02:04:58,515 --> 02:05:00,275
I'm winding up an old business.

1293
02:05:00,915 --> 02:05:07,555
Now look; this box contains
a hundred thousand Rupees.

1294
02:05:08,035 --> 02:05:12,195
It's for you. You must forget
her, after taking this.

1295
02:05:12,235 --> 02:05:13,755
Forget whom?

1296
02:05:14,995 --> 02:05:17,755
Your second idea is brilliant!

1297
02:05:19,755 --> 02:05:24,035
What should I do, when my
money is over in two years...

1298
02:05:24,275 --> 02:05:26,995
...and I begin to miss her?

1299
02:05:27,315 --> 02:05:30,235
Then call on me.
Forget her.

1300
02:05:30,955 --> 02:05:33,315
You have given me your word.
Do not go back on it.

1301
02:05:33,515 --> 02:05:39,435
I can have a slip of tongue,
but I don't go back on it.

1302
02:05:39,755 --> 02:05:45,275
I swear on his head!
Laxmi is not my wife!

1303
02:05:45,835 --> 02:05:49,195
What's he saying? But this man
is not Laxmi's husband, sir!

1304
02:05:49,475 --> 02:05:51,995
That's exactly what he's saying.

1305
02:05:52,795 --> 02:05:54,475
He is not Laxmi's husband!

1306
02:05:55,235 --> 02:05:59,075
That's what I'm saying!
I am not Laxmi's husband!

1307
02:05:59,315 --> 02:06:04,755
The only Laxmi (Goddess of
Wealth) I know is with me!

1308
02:06:05,155 --> 02:06:06,555
Hear me out, sir...

1309
02:06:10,595 --> 02:06:11,835
Did you send for me?

1310
02:06:11,875 --> 02:06:15,035
Yes. Look who's here.

1311
02:06:23,075 --> 02:06:25,755
Good God! What are
you doing here?

1312
02:06:26,075 --> 02:06:27,875
What's he doing here, I say!

1313
02:06:28,315 --> 02:06:30,515
I've called Laxmi's husband here.

1314
02:06:30,635 --> 02:06:35,235
Hari should've been here then!
Will you keep quiet, please?

1315
02:06:35,915 --> 02:06:37,555
This man is now my husband.

1316
02:06:38,595 --> 02:06:44,035
Didn't I say she's a shady one?
She has two husbands!

1317
02:06:44,395 --> 02:06:48,075
There's no need to get emotional.

1318
02:06:48,275 --> 02:06:53,035
This Joseph was earlier Hari and Godbole.

1319
02:06:53,235 --> 02:06:54,355
Who on earth is Godbole...

1320
02:06:56,635 --> 02:06:59,235
I won't talk to you!

1321
02:06:59,875 --> 02:07:02,635
You've forgotten everything
in your drunkenness!

1322
02:07:02,715 --> 02:07:04,555
You've forgotten Godbole!

1323
02:07:04,755 --> 02:07:07,955
And you will forget Hari,
Joseph and me, too!

1324
02:07:08,355 --> 02:07:10,475
I have forgotten nothing and
I won't in future either.

1325
02:07:10,835 --> 02:07:15,075
Even if Hari converts to
Godbole, that's only in name...

1326
02:07:15,275 --> 02:07:16,615
...not in appearance, all right?

1327
02:07:16,635 --> 02:07:20,475
But who told you that Hari is my husband?

1328
02:07:20,715 --> 02:07:21,955
Jai told me, of course.

1329
02:07:22,195 --> 02:07:24,315
I'm not Jai! I'm Laxmi!

1330
02:07:24,515 --> 02:07:28,795
Only I can decide who my husband is!

1331
02:07:28,955 --> 02:07:30,675
Well said, Laxmi!

1332
02:07:32,275 --> 02:07:36,595
Hang on, sir! Let's begin
at the beginning!

1333
02:07:37,315 --> 02:07:39,715
It began with Joseph
and Hari and Godbole...

1334
02:07:39,955 --> 02:07:41,955
Just go away, Banwa!

1335
02:07:42,355 --> 02:07:45,875
Godbole converted and
became Hari. And then...

1336
02:07:46,435 --> 02:07:50,395
Go away, or I will fire you, Banwa!

1337
02:07:50,795 --> 02:07:55,075
Sorry, sir. But aunty...
tell me what you've decided!

1338
02:07:55,235 --> 02:07:56,955
Who has converted to what?!

1339
02:08:02,075 --> 02:08:05,595
What have you come here for?
Watch out!

1340
02:08:05,835 --> 02:08:10,075
You're right! I shouldn't have
landed here between you!

1341
02:08:10,275 --> 02:08:12,715
I'm really a third-rate man!

1342
02:08:13,035 --> 02:08:18,955
I'd welcome such "beatings"
anyday, without a protest!

1343
02:08:19,275 --> 02:08:24,635
You are my husband! I will
not let you get "beaten" up!

1344
02:08:24,955 --> 02:08:29,475
Please let me! Haven't you
been through hell for me, too?

1345
02:08:30,035 --> 02:08:32,595
Don't I have this much of a right?

1346
02:08:32,835 --> 02:08:37,395
What about mine? One can't
spend a lifetime with 4000!

1347
02:08:37,435 --> 02:08:39,835
And that bloody mobike has no takers!

1348
02:08:40,075 --> 02:08:43,915
You get his hand...
and I get the dough!

1349
02:08:44,675 --> 02:08:47,115
She now belongs to you!

1350
02:08:50,875 --> 02:08:56,955
Your hand is now in mine!
And my life is in your hands.

1351
02:08:58,395 --> 02:09:00,835
The ball is now in your court!

1352
02:09:00,915 --> 02:09:03,295
Mr Jaiprakash... you have done
many films as an assistant...

1353
02:09:03,335 --> 02:09:05,195
...and you're now an
independent choreographer.

1354
02:09:05,235 --> 02:09:06,715
Do I switch it off?
No! Let it play.

1355
02:09:06,755 --> 02:09:10,795
How do you find it?
It's a great feeling.

1356
02:09:13,115 --> 02:09:15,075
Let it play, Bharti.
Papa's on telly.

1357
02:09:16,275 --> 02:09:18,355
Papa inside and Papa outside, too!

1358
02:09:19,435 --> 02:09:21,635
Don't tease her, baby...
Come on.

1359
02:09:21,675 --> 02:09:25,395
"You want to know about
my personal life? Strange"

1360
02:09:26,595 --> 02:09:31,195
How would it remain personal,
if I speak about it publicly?

1361
02:09:31,355 --> 02:09:32,795
May I leave?

1362
02:09:33,275 --> 02:09:36,635
I want to ask you some
questions about your family.

1363
02:09:36,755 --> 02:09:38,555
Aren't they personal, too?

1364
02:09:39,355 --> 02:09:42,435
Atleast tell the viewers
if you are married or not.

1365
02:09:42,675 --> 02:09:44,555
Sure, I am.
How many kids do you have?

1366
02:09:44,875 --> 02:09:48,155
I have two kids...
two daughters, actually.

1367
02:09:48,755 --> 02:09:53,835
The first one is still small,
but the other is elder.

1368
02:09:54,675 --> 02:09:59,995
Normally, the first one is elder, right?

1369
02:10:00,595 --> 02:10:02,355
All right. Have it your way.

1370
02:10:02,635 --> 02:10:09,195
Actually, the first daughter
studies in Class 2.

1371
02:10:09,595 --> 02:10:11,915
And what class does the other one attend?

1372
02:10:11,995 --> 02:10:16,995
She's in an upper-standard;
She's all of 27... my wife!

1373
02:10:19,915 --> 02:10:23,475
She celebrates her birthday
on the 11 th of the next month.

1374
02:10:23,715 --> 02:10:25,075
So he remembers.

1375
02:10:25,195 --> 02:10:28,035
Wasn't it your birthday yesterday?

1376
02:10:28,355 --> 02:10:32,675
My viewers would like to
know more about your kids.

1377
02:10:32,715 --> 02:10:33,715
Must I switch it off?

1378
02:10:34,875 --> 02:10:37,115
"Especially the elder one"

1379
02:10:38,595 --> 02:10:41,435
The elder one is more childish
than the younger one.

1380
02:10:41,795 --> 02:10:45,395
She's always asking for
things like the kids do.

1381
02:10:45,475 --> 02:10:48,115
I gave her everything.

1382
02:10:49,315 --> 02:10:52,315
And one fine day, she
asked for a divorce...

1383
02:10:52,475 --> 02:10:54,195
...and I let her have that, too.

1384
02:10:56,635 --> 02:10:59,915
I'm sorry. We didn't know
you have separated.

1385
02:11:00,435 --> 02:11:04,355
She thinks so. But I have
never separated from her.

1386
02:11:05,035 --> 02:11:07,475
I am still with her.

1387
02:11:08,275 --> 02:11:13,875
Do you still love her?

1388
02:11:15,635 --> 02:11:18,315
Tell our viewers... not me.

1389
02:11:19,235 --> 02:11:20,835
You are putting words in my mouth!

1390
02:11:21,035 --> 02:11:24,075
But I will speak the truth.

1391
02:11:33,115 --> 02:11:38,075
Laws can break marriages...
they can't break love.

1392
02:11:40,395 --> 02:11:43,675
Yes... I love her.

1393
02:18:14,955 --> 02:18:17,075
Do you still love him?

1394
02:18:19,755 --> 02:18:24,755
Do you want me to call him over?
No.

1395
02:18:27,435 --> 02:18:32,675
I know he doesn't need me now.
But neither do I.

1396
02:18:38,955 --> 02:18:40,315
Very well...

1397
02:18:52,595 --> 02:18:53,955
Why are you crying?

1398
02:18:54,515 --> 02:18:57,835
You've made my mother cry!
I'll tell her everything!

1399
02:18:59,395 --> 02:19:01,675
No! Not yet!
Why not?

1400
02:19:02,515 --> 02:19:08,195
Because only I need her now.
She doesn't need me.

1401
02:19:10,995 --> 02:19:12,035
All right.

1402
02:19:25,515 --> 02:19:31,395
I've got him!
The dumbo has been exposed!

1403
02:19:31,635 --> 02:19:34,755
Sir! The latest news for you!

1404
02:19:35,275 --> 02:19:38,355
That he's a Muslim, isn't it?

1405
02:19:38,715 --> 02:19:41,715
You are omniscient, sir!
How did you know?

1406
02:19:42,835 --> 02:19:48,195
Obviously. Godbole converted
to Hari and then became Joseph.

1407
02:19:48,515 --> 02:19:52,635
He only had to become a Muslim
now. What's so surprising?

1408
02:19:52,835 --> 02:19:57,795
All you talk about is aunty!
I have some fresh news for you!

1409
02:19:58,355 --> 02:20:00,715
That Shivraj is actually
a Muslim. And he can speak!

1410
02:20:06,315 --> 02:20:07,755
What nonsense are you talking?

1411
02:20:07,995 --> 02:20:11,035
You think I'm crazy!
But just wait!

1412
02:20:11,715 --> 02:20:15,035
Shivraj! Get the master
a cup of tea!

1413
02:20:16,315 --> 02:20:18,955
Greet him in Muslim style...
"As salaam aliekom" okay?

1414
02:20:26,075 --> 02:20:27,795
Assalaam aliekom...
Valiekom...

1415
02:20:28,035 --> 02:20:29,435
What next?

1416
02:20:34,075 --> 02:20:36,035
See that, sir?
Bloody cheat!

1417
02:20:36,755 --> 02:20:38,955
You have been betraying me!

1418
02:20:39,635 --> 02:20:41,355
You never told me you're a Muslim!

1419
02:20:41,835 --> 02:20:45,475
Please forgive me, sir.
I have sinned!

1420
02:20:46,355 --> 02:20:51,155
It's true that I'm a Muslim.
But I'm surely dumb!

1421
02:20:52,835 --> 02:20:56,275
Then how did you speak so much?
Won't I, if I'm kicked?

1422
02:20:56,475 --> 02:20:59,275
Aunty's the root of all evil!
She employed this man!

1423
02:20:59,795 --> 02:21:01,715
As for Aunty, I say you...

1424
02:21:03,155 --> 02:21:05,475
Welcome!
Have you been praising me?

1425
02:21:05,755 --> 02:21:08,755
No! This chap Shivraj...

1426
02:21:09,195 --> 02:21:12,675
Is a Muslim and he can speak.
Is that what you want to say?

1427
02:21:12,875 --> 02:21:14,715
Now look...!
Will you remain silent?

1428
02:21:15,355 --> 02:21:20,035
Will you give me a minute, sir?
I must talk to you.

1429
02:21:21,275 --> 02:21:26,955
No, sir... not at all!
It's a trap!

1430
02:21:28,435 --> 02:21:29,915
He's had it!

1431
02:21:32,915 --> 02:21:38,755
You have sinned by employing
a Muslim cook in my house!

1432
02:21:39,555 --> 02:21:44,995
I admit I have lied to you.
But I must have a reason.

1433
02:21:45,355 --> 02:21:48,395
What reason can there be
behind such a great lie?

1434
02:21:48,635 --> 02:21:52,955
There are two reasons.
He is poor and honest.

1435
02:21:53,395 --> 02:21:58,635
I know him since he used to
work in an Irani restaurant.

1436
02:21:59,075 --> 02:22:05,075
How disgusting! Working in an
Irani non-vegetarian eatery!

1437
02:22:05,675 --> 02:22:10,595
My God! My house has
been defiled, Laxmi!

1438
02:22:11,355 --> 02:22:14,835
I wish to say something, but
please don't take of fence.

1439
02:22:15,675 --> 02:22:18,915
There's not much difference
between you and Shiraj.

1440
02:22:20,195 --> 02:22:25,035
I don't even touch flesh! And
he slaughters cattle everyday!

1441
02:22:25,395 --> 02:22:27,155
He does it to earn a living.

1442
02:22:27,675 --> 02:22:30,275
And I wonder how many animals
you order slayed...

1443
02:22:30,475 --> 02:22:34,155
...because you want their hides
for bags, belts and shoes...

1444
02:22:34,315 --> 02:22:36,235
...which you export.

1445
02:22:36,875 --> 02:22:40,515
But that's my business!
This is his business, too.

1446
02:22:41,075 --> 02:22:44,435
You have animals killed, too.

1447
02:22:45,035 --> 02:22:47,755
Perhaps more than those who eat them.

1448
02:22:48,355 --> 02:22:53,195
If I'm not mistaken, this house
and the room of prayers...

1449
02:22:53,315 --> 02:22:55,995
...is all a result of those
earnings from hide, isn't it?

1450
02:23:00,435 --> 02:23:06,115
Ever since he has come here,
he hasn't touched meat.

1451
02:23:06,955 --> 02:23:09,275
Wouldn't you call that a change?

1452
02:23:09,315 --> 02:23:12,075
But there's no change in you whatsoever.

1453
02:23:12,595 --> 02:23:17,235
Animals are still being
slaughtered in your factory.

1454
02:23:20,635 --> 02:23:24,355
Maybe I've spoken more than I should have.

1455
02:23:24,955 --> 02:23:28,675
I'm sorry. I'll sack him,
if you still don't approve...

1456
02:23:34,835 --> 02:23:37,915
Is Shivraj a Muslim?
Yes! He even speaks!

1457
02:23:38,275 --> 02:23:40,875
Give the lady a sample.
What will I say?

1458
02:23:41,115 --> 02:23:44,235
Shut up! You were better off
as a dumbo!

1459
02:23:44,875 --> 02:23:47,115
Have you heard, Papa?
Shivraj is a Muslim!

1460
02:23:48,315 --> 02:23:50,955
Aunty! How could you
tell us such a great lie?

1461
02:23:51,795 --> 02:23:55,435
I did not speak the truth.
But I did not lie either.

1462
02:23:55,595 --> 02:23:59,395
That's enough! You can't get
away with that sweet-talk!

1463
02:23:59,595 --> 02:24:04,035
I will get to the truth
right now! Speak up!

1464
02:24:04,315 --> 02:24:07,075
Shut up! And mind
your own business.

1465
02:24:07,755 --> 02:24:09,235
What are you saying, Papa!

1466
02:24:09,675 --> 02:24:13,075
You've been eating at the hands
of a non-vegetarian...

1467
02:24:13,555 --> 02:24:18,915
...and you defend a woman who has
condemned us to sacrilege?!

1468
02:24:19,995 --> 02:24:23,355
Did you commit no sacrilege...

1469
02:24:23,875 --> 02:24:26,275
...when you cooked meat in your
husband's house for 6 years?

1470
02:24:26,315 --> 02:24:29,235
You mustn't scold the child...
I am not your child!

1471
02:24:30,115 --> 02:24:32,395
Don't interfere between us!
Get out!

1472
02:24:32,555 --> 02:24:36,835
I don't want to talk to you!
Go upstairs!

1473
02:24:37,635 --> 02:24:39,195
Why must I go upstairs?

1474
02:24:39,435 --> 02:24:42,115
Have I no right to this house?
Doesn't it belong to me?

1475
02:24:42,515 --> 02:24:45,315
No. This is not your house!

1476
02:24:46,275 --> 02:24:48,195
You have walked out of your home!

1477
02:24:49,115 --> 02:24:51,675
This house belongs to Durgaprasad Bhardwaj!

1478
02:24:51,755 --> 02:24:53,235
Now go upstairs!

1479
02:25:00,355 --> 02:25:02,595
Grant me your leave, aunty!

1480
02:25:06,875 --> 02:25:08,355
Where are you off to?

1481
02:25:09,595 --> 02:25:11,915
You can bloody well speak!
Talk properly!

1482
02:25:13,075 --> 02:25:16,555
I'm going home, sir.
Who will cook for us?

1483
02:25:18,115 --> 02:25:21,075
Go the kitchen and get cracking.

1484
02:25:22,275 --> 02:25:24,875
And remember...
I'm a vegetarian.

1485
02:25:25,995 --> 02:25:28,675
We will not permit flesh
and fish in this family!

1486
02:25:29,755 --> 02:25:33,555
If you wish to stay here, you
will have to abide by my rules!

1487
02:25:41,475 --> 02:25:43,835
Haven't I changed?

1488
02:25:44,115 --> 02:25:46,875
Is everything okay now?
No.

1489
02:25:47,115 --> 02:25:48,395
What's the matter now?

1490
02:25:49,115 --> 02:25:52,795
You have told your daughter
that this is not her house.

1491
02:25:53,075 --> 02:25:55,635
But have you shown her
the way to her own home?

1492
02:25:56,275 --> 02:25:57,795
I don't understand, darling.

1493
02:25:58,475 --> 02:26:02,115
You're 60. And you're still
looking for a life-mate.

1494
02:26:02,715 --> 02:26:06,955
But will your daughter spend
the rest of her life all alone?

1495
02:26:10,195 --> 02:26:13,955
Had Lajwanti been alive today,
for Janki's sake...

1496
02:26:14,115 --> 02:26:17,075
...she'd have seen that Janki
settles down again.

1497
02:26:17,755 --> 02:26:21,475
I'm younger to you, no doubt.
Please don't mind what I'm...

1498
02:26:30,915 --> 02:26:37,915
Lajwanti! I have decided
to bring back my son-in-law.

1499
02:26:39,755 --> 02:26:41,195
What do you say?

1500
02:26:44,035 --> 02:26:46,795
Lajwanti has agreed with me!

1501
02:26:47,715 --> 02:26:49,915
She has blessed them!
I'll be on my way!

1502
02:26:50,555 --> 02:26:52,035
Where are you going?

1503
02:26:52,235 --> 02:26:54,435
I'm going to my son-in-law
to bring him back!

1504
02:26:54,675 --> 02:26:57,195
He won't be at home now.

1505
02:26:57,475 --> 02:26:58,435
Why not?

1506
02:26:59,275 --> 02:27:03,955
I think he's busy shooting
somewhere right now.

1507
02:27:04,075 --> 02:27:06,914
Wherever he is, I will
cajole him into coming back.

1508
02:27:06,915 --> 02:27:10,355
Then let me leave, too.
I must go and change.

1509
02:27:10,635 --> 02:27:14,635
No. Not now.
I have scolded Janki.

1510
02:27:15,035 --> 02:27:17,435
She must be sulking.
So go and keep her company.

1511
02:27:17,795 --> 02:27:21,915
I'll meet my son-in-law, set
everything right and return.

1512
02:27:33,595 --> 02:27:38,635
Aunt made a fool out of
the old man in public!

1513
02:27:39,635 --> 02:27:43,235
I'm afraid, she might lure the boss, too.

1514
02:27:43,355 --> 02:27:45,395
Do you know what you are saying, Banwa?

1515
02:27:45,715 --> 02:27:49,315
I know what you're thinking!
You can't see the obvious!

1516
02:27:49,915 --> 02:27:53,115
Don't you see how she has
wrested control of the family?

1517
02:28:06,795 --> 02:28:07,715
Excuse me...

1518
02:28:07,755 --> 02:28:11,155
It's the month-end.
You will get nothing!

1519
02:28:12,395 --> 02:28:14,635
I want to meet Mr Jaiprakash.

1520
02:28:15,515 --> 02:28:18,755
You've made me miss my count!

1521
02:28:18,835 --> 02:28:21,055
You can't meet him now. He
returns only in the evening.

1522
02:28:21,075 --> 02:28:23,675
I have some important work.
But he's not in!

1523
02:28:24,995 --> 02:28:28,715
I'm his father-in-law!
Must I lie to you then?

1524
02:28:28,955 --> 02:28:30,675
He's not in, I say!

1525
02:28:30,955 --> 02:28:35,395
This is Jaiprakash.
But he's not here now!

1526
02:28:36,115 --> 02:28:40,355
Haribhai! This is Jaiprakash
on the telephone line!

1527
02:28:40,875 --> 02:28:42,595
There he is.

1528
02:28:44,435 --> 02:28:48,555
My father-in-law will arrive
there. He's a bit crazy.

1529
02:28:49,915 --> 02:28:52,515
Throw him out immediately.

1530
02:28:52,595 --> 02:28:54,715
If you encourage him,
you'll have a calamity in hand!

1531
02:28:54,795 --> 02:28:57,795
I won't let you have a
calamity, son-in-law!

1532
02:28:57,995 --> 02:28:59,675
Am I son-in-law to
you too, Haribhai?

1533
02:29:00,075 --> 02:29:02,755
This is Durgaprasad Bhardwaj speaking.

1534
02:29:03,635 --> 02:29:08,235
You?! I don't know
how to talk to you!

1535
02:29:09,235 --> 02:29:12,435
I called you names,
taking you for Haribhai!

1536
02:29:13,355 --> 02:29:17,995
You are right, son-in-law.
I have been crazy till now.

1537
02:29:18,555 --> 02:29:20,915
Whatever you say is true, sir!

1538
02:29:21,555 --> 02:29:23,395
I come here to apologise to you.

1539
02:29:23,955 --> 02:29:27,755
I consider this instrument to be your feet

1540
02:29:27,995 --> 02:29:29,915
Hold it!
This pau (bread) is mine!

1541
02:29:30,395 --> 02:29:33,875
Please forget everything
about the past, my son.

1542
02:29:34,075 --> 02:29:36,075
Come and take your wife away.

1543
02:29:36,755 --> 02:29:39,715
I want to meet you and discuss this.

1544
02:29:40,475 --> 02:29:42,355
Where are you calling from?
From your place.

1545
02:29:42,515 --> 02:29:43,635
My place?

1546
02:29:44,475 --> 02:29:47,795
I'm shooting at a place near your house.

1547
02:29:48,395 --> 02:29:51,515
It'll take me time to change and come over.

1548
02:29:51,715 --> 02:29:56,555
You don't need to change, son!
Because I have changed now.

1549
02:29:57,275 --> 02:30:02,555
D'you know that it is a woman
who has changed my life?

1550
02:30:04,035 --> 02:30:05,675
I know.
But how?

1551
02:30:06,995 --> 02:30:09,675
You've just told me.
Of course!

1552
02:30:10,235 --> 02:30:12,315
Her name is Laxmi.

1553
02:30:13,275 --> 02:30:15,435
Say, mister...
Do you know Laxmi?

1554
02:30:16,915 --> 02:30:18,755
Do you know Laxmi too?

1555
02:30:19,075 --> 02:30:22,395
Do you know Laxmi?
And you, son-in-law?

1556
02:30:22,955 --> 02:30:28,795
Yes. She used to cook for me in
Janki's absence. From 6 to 9.

1557
02:30:29,195 --> 02:30:31,315
She was at my place from
9 to 5 in the daytime!

1558
02:30:31,555 --> 02:30:34,875
She's been looking after Janki
and Bharti for sometime now.

1559
02:30:35,395 --> 02:30:39,075
But she never mentioned anything about you.

1560
02:30:39,355 --> 02:30:44,555
That's Laxmi!
She never carries tales!

1561
02:30:44,915 --> 02:30:46,835
A great woman!
She's like my mother.

1562
02:30:47,355 --> 02:30:51,755
A correction, son...
she's like your mother-in-law.

1563
02:30:53,315 --> 02:30:56,475
Not right... she's married.
Her husband is still alive.

1564
02:30:56,955 --> 02:30:58,475
I've bought him over.

1565
02:30:58,875 --> 02:31:01,635
Nobody told me he could be bought!

1566
02:31:01,795 --> 02:31:03,395
I'd have bought him too!

1567
02:31:03,795 --> 02:31:05,475
What's going on?

1568
02:31:06,715 --> 02:31:09,355
Nothing, son-in-law.
It's just a cross-connection.

1569
02:31:09,595 --> 02:31:12,315
Whatever it is...
it's my phone!

1570
02:31:12,875 --> 02:31:16,875
Don't pass the phone to
Haribhai... he's crazy.

1571
02:31:17,355 --> 02:31:19,395
Jai! You rascal!

1572
02:31:19,675 --> 02:31:22,715
Why're you changing your voice?
This is Haribhai!

1573
02:31:23,315 --> 02:31:25,315
Haribhai! You'd never
change your voice!

1574
02:31:28,355 --> 02:31:30,715
You have betrayed me!

1575
02:31:31,435 --> 02:31:33,715
Why didn't you tell me that
Laxmi is up for sale?

1576
02:31:33,955 --> 02:31:36,395
I tell you now! She's sold!
Pass the phone to him!

1577
02:31:36,955 --> 02:31:39,075
How did you buy her?
In the black-market!

1578
02:31:41,075 --> 02:31:43,995
I will wait here for you,
son-in-law!

1579
02:31:44,195 --> 02:31:48,435
No! Please go on. I'll come
over today to take Janki away!

1580
02:31:48,595 --> 02:31:52,435
Very well then.
I will hang up now.

1581
02:31:58,875 --> 02:32:01,035
Have you just had a bath?
No!

1582
02:32:02,555 --> 02:32:05,035
Is it Kerosene?
Yes!

1583
02:32:06,835 --> 02:32:08,315
What madness is this?

1584
02:32:08,715 --> 02:32:12,515
It's you who will go mad
when you see me in flames!

1585
02:32:15,395 --> 02:32:18,395
But why do this?
You've betrayed the boss!

1586
02:32:18,955 --> 02:32:21,395
I've done nothing of the sort!
You're talking nonsense!

1587
02:32:21,675 --> 02:32:24,795
Don't you know how much he loves you?

1588
02:32:25,715 --> 02:32:28,395
You'd better agree for
the wedding. Or else...

1589
02:32:30,075 --> 02:32:34,235
No weddings, sir!
I'm already married!

1590
02:32:34,635 --> 02:32:37,875
So what?
I already have a husband!

1591
02:32:38,515 --> 02:32:42,435
The drunkard is no patch on my
boss! He fled with the dough!

1592
02:32:42,875 --> 02:32:46,995
My boss is a decent man!
But I'm a man, too!

1593
02:32:47,315 --> 02:32:49,155
There's no bigger man than my master!

1594
02:32:49,675 --> 02:32:53,355
Maybe I'm younger...
But I'm certainly a man.

1595
02:32:54,715 --> 02:32:57,155
Shiraj! I'm Jai!

1596
02:32:58,715 --> 02:33:01,915
Try again! You can't con me
with a different voice!

1597
02:33:02,275 --> 02:33:05,195
Damn it! I'm your buddy...
Jaiprakash Paswan!

1598
02:33:05,435 --> 02:33:09,795
Won't do! You will soon
claim you're Durgaprasad!

1599
02:33:12,795 --> 02:33:14,555
I didn't light it!

1600
02:33:21,995 --> 02:33:25,155
No! Please spare me...
I don't want to see this!

1601
02:33:32,675 --> 02:33:34,795
Aunty! This is outstanding!

1602
02:33:37,155 --> 02:33:39,555
I've never seen something like this!

1603
02:33:49,115 --> 02:33:51,635
This is a whorehouse!
You're right!

1604
02:33:52,075 --> 02:33:54,155
I won't stay here another moment!

1605
02:33:54,595 --> 02:33:56,355
Listen to me...
where are you going?

1606
02:33:58,115 --> 02:34:00,315
I'm going home... to Jai.

1607
02:34:01,035 --> 02:34:03,555
Tell Dad that I will never
return to this hell!

1608
02:34:03,755 --> 02:34:05,295
What if Jai demands a test by fire...

1609
02:34:05,335 --> 02:34:06,635
...and refuses to accept you?

1610
02:34:07,035 --> 02:34:08,435
There has to be a woman there too!

1611
02:34:08,875 --> 02:34:12,875
Although we are divorced,
he still loves me, Banwa.

1612
02:34:14,195 --> 02:34:15,435
He's not like that.

1613
02:34:16,475 --> 02:34:18,835
There can be no woman
in his life except me!

1614
02:34:19,435 --> 02:34:23,835
Bring Bharti to Jai's place
when she returns from school.

1615
02:34:24,475 --> 02:34:29,995
Please don't do this!
What will I tell the master?

1616
02:34:34,875 --> 02:34:37,595
Wow! That was fun, wasn't it?

1617
02:34:37,915 --> 02:34:41,755
Don't take your arms off her!

1618
02:34:42,795 --> 02:34:46,315
The boss eyes her and she eyes others!

1619
02:34:46,755 --> 02:34:50,475
This is no joke! I'll
have you sacked today!

1620
02:34:51,115 --> 02:34:53,075
And Janki has left...
she will not come back.

1621
02:34:53,555 --> 02:34:55,235
Where did she go?
She saw you at it...

1622
02:34:55,275 --> 02:34:56,855
...and returned to her
husband's house.

1623
02:34:56,856 --> 02:34:59,835
To her husband's home?
Give me the arm, aunty!

1624
02:35:08,355 --> 02:35:11,435
A woman hits me! What does
he have that I don't?

1625
02:35:12,115 --> 02:35:16,395
All right. Give him the rest
of the kicks, Shiraj!

1626
02:35:30,715 --> 02:35:36,315
A call...! Kaushi?
Let's meet after some days.

1627
02:35:36,675 --> 02:35:41,955
I'm at it now... It'll take me
some days to revive!

1628
02:35:52,675 --> 02:35:56,995
You don't know me, but I
do. Aren't you Janki?

1629
02:35:57,515 --> 02:35:59,235
Who are you?
I'm Jai's partner.

1630
02:36:00,955 --> 02:36:02,715
Jai's not in.

1631
02:36:11,715 --> 02:36:12,995
Are those your clothes?

1632
02:36:13,275 --> 02:36:16,795
They're someone else's.
Someone else?

1633
02:36:17,075 --> 02:36:19,155
Aunt Laxmi. She comes
here every night.

1634
02:36:20,595 --> 02:36:25,955
Laxmi! Not here too!
In the night, you say?

1635
02:36:27,475 --> 02:36:31,315
I don't know. Jai told me that
she comes every night.

1636
02:36:32,035 --> 02:36:33,835
I'm here by day.

1637
02:36:34,955 --> 02:36:37,515
You by day... and
Laxmi by night, eh?

1638
02:36:38,395 --> 02:36:41,635
Why target poor Laxmi?
...please sit down.

1639
02:36:45,595 --> 02:36:48,395
Tell him that I've gone away forever!

1640
02:36:48,595 --> 02:36:50,755
But where to?
To die!

1641
02:36:50,995 --> 02:36:53,835
No! Poor Jai will be worried!

1642
02:36:55,275 --> 02:36:59,155
You're worried about him!
Yes... no!

1643
02:36:59,315 --> 02:37:01,795
Go back there... Go on!
But...

1644
02:37:01,915 --> 02:37:03,555
Go back, I say!

1645
02:37:27,755 --> 02:37:29,915
Where are you, Jai?
Where's Janki?

1646
02:37:29,955 --> 02:37:31,595
Where's Jai?
He isn't there.

1647
02:37:31,635 --> 02:37:33,515
But I heard him!

1648
02:37:35,555 --> 02:37:37,635
He has left! Where is Janki?

1649
02:37:37,675 --> 02:37:39,395
She's gone to kill herself.

1650
02:37:39,595 --> 02:37:42,275
She suspects you have
something going with Jai.

1651
02:37:42,395 --> 02:37:45,075
I do. That is what
I wanted to explain.

1652
02:37:45,155 --> 02:37:49,835
How could you do it when Janki
and I are still around?!

1653
02:37:50,115 --> 02:37:51,075
Bloody wretch...

1654
02:37:52,675 --> 02:37:56,795
I'm sorry! I'll explain...

1655
02:38:01,675 --> 02:38:05,235
Wait, Aunty...!
You try to strangle me!

1656
02:39:18,635 --> 02:39:21,915
Janki! Don't...!

1657
02:39:23,115 --> 02:39:25,715
Aunty! She comes even here?!

1658
02:39:25,955 --> 02:39:27,355
No!

1659
02:39:43,875 --> 02:39:47,515
I can't even die!
Where are you going?

1660
02:39:48,115 --> 02:39:50,475
To find deeper waters!

1661
02:39:50,715 --> 02:39:52,875
Wait... do you know
who I am?

1662
02:39:53,115 --> 02:39:56,955
Of course! You're a witch!
A woman with many men!

1663
02:39:57,155 --> 02:39:59,315
Wrong! Look... who I am!

1664
02:40:00,035 --> 02:40:05,115
Oh no! God! What a woman!
I don't want to see.

1665
02:40:05,235 --> 02:40:06,195
Here you are!

1666
02:40:10,115 --> 02:40:12,475
What's happened, aunt?

1667
02:40:15,675 --> 02:40:20,675
I am Jai... look.

1668
02:40:26,035 --> 02:40:30,395
Forgive me, Jai!
I'll never leave you again!

1669
02:40:31,115 --> 02:40:35,115
We'll stay like this forever!
We'll fall sick like this.

1670
02:40:36,555 --> 02:40:39,955
Let's go home and tell
Papa everything. Come on.

1671
02:40:39,995 --> 02:40:42,395
We won't tell him anything!
Why not?

1672
02:40:43,555 --> 02:40:46,195
We won't! Period!
But he has forgiven you!

1673
02:40:47,035 --> 02:40:50,595
He forgave me, because aunty told him to.

1674
02:40:50,835 --> 02:40:54,635
But he'd never forgive aunty,
if I told him the truth.

1675
02:40:55,315 --> 02:40:57,715
What do we do with aunt then?
Let's kill her.

1676
02:40:58,555 --> 02:41:01,395
Kill her? No...
Jai is not dying.

1677
02:41:01,715 --> 02:41:07,955
We'll simply say that she died
saving you in the waters!

1678
02:41:10,995 --> 02:41:14,155
What about the body?
We'll produce this.

1679
02:41:26,875 --> 02:41:31,435
Janki... Lajwanti was only
the one who had borne you.

1680
02:41:32,915 --> 02:41:37,875
But Laxmi saved you and gave
you a second lease of life.

1681
02:41:39,155 --> 02:41:43,115
She has left, after doing
what she was destined to do!

1682
02:41:43,795 --> 02:41:48,835
No one got Laxmi. Not her
husband nor Mr Durgaprasad...

1683
02:41:49,155 --> 02:41:50,875
I wasn't even in the reckoning.

1684
02:41:50,915 --> 02:41:53,835
You're always in the reckoning, Haribai!

1685
02:41:53,875 --> 02:41:57,835
Aren't you ashamed to defame
a great soul, Banwa!

1686
02:41:58,155 --> 02:41:59,715
You just said, sir...
Shut up!

1687
02:42:01,195 --> 02:42:02,475
Get lost!

1688
02:42:04,075 --> 02:42:05,475
Son-in-law!

1689
02:42:05,715 --> 02:42:08,755
Please let him stay!

1690
02:42:12,515 --> 02:42:15,515
We're all brothers!
Siraj and I are brothers!

1691
02:42:17,715 --> 02:42:21,395
Why have you left me, Laxmi?

1692
02:42:22,115 --> 02:42:25,995
Why cry for Laxmi?
She hasn't gone anywhere!

1693
02:42:29,395 --> 02:42:31,395
In ten minutes flat...

1694
02:42:32,515 --> 02:42:36,155
You don't know what he really means.

1695
02:42:36,515 --> 02:42:39,675
Laxmi lives in our hearts, he says.

1696
02:42:40,115 --> 02:42:43,075
The intimate ones understand!
Nobody else does!

1697
02:42:43,755 --> 02:42:44,755
Yes...

1698
02:42:45,075 --> 02:42:48,595
That's the "gist" of the story, isn't it?

1699
02:42:48,915 --> 02:42:50,555
Exactly! That's it!

1700
02:42:57,795 --> 02:43:01,115
Why do you always giggle, Mom?

1701
02:43:01,155 --> 02:43:03,155
I'm sorry! Forgive me!

1702
02:43:08,155 --> 02:43:13,155
