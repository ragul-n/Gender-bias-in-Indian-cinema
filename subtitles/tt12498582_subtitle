1
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,230
I can never forget this day

2
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,420
because, I know where this journey would take me..

3
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,000
but in which way? I don't know..

4
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,260
I never wanted drama in life

5
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,150
but love - it comes with drama, by default

6
00:00:59,330 --> 00:00:59,640
Hello

7
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,260
Ram!

8
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,440
The apple tv you brought last time doesn't work properly

9
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,260
it reboots once every 10 minutes!

10
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,860
Its 3 am here Bhanu.

11
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,240
It was snowing - Couldn't take my car..

12
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,290
I walked home and am damn tired

13
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,420
Don't act smart just because you are in the US

14
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,750
We have long ago stopped treating NRIs differently.

15
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,970
what did I say and what are you talking?

16
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,000
Its clear

17
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,000
you talk like an attention seeking NRI

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,000
and I'm offering you a reality check

19
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,440
why do you call me so many times when I'm in a meeting?

20
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,620
But I've called you just once!

21
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,840
Isn't that enough for disturbing the meeting?

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,890
Hello

23
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,260
Bhanu, I'm with a client..

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,370
shall I call you back in an hour?

25
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,710
Its been four hours, Ram

26
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,090
since you promised to call me

27
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,290
Sorry Bhanu

28
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,290
the client just left..(line cuts)

29
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,770
Ram!!

30
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,510
don't expect me to be glancing at the phone every 10 minutes waiting for your call.

31
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,530
I have least interest in being your 2nd priority!!

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,970
My dad loved his mother very much

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,550
He named me after her, as he loves me more..

34
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,370
her name was

35
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,400
   "BHANUMATHI"

36
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,460
..to her name

37
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,490
I,
from my schooling in Vijayawada to my masters in London

38
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,530
have given that name a personality.

39
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,090
I live in Hyderabad

40
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,930
I work as Delivery Manager for an Advertising firm

41
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,130
for us to present ourselves confidently,

42
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,000
Fitness, I believe, is important

43
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,970
I put on weight very easily..

44
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,030
so I try to be as disciplined as possible.

45
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,890
rather than lazing around a coffee shop

46
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,200
I'd prefer following business news

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,460
Bhanu!

48
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,240
thank you very much

49
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,440
What for?

50
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,530
for referring me for the Vietnam project..

51
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,820
I owe you a treat!

52
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,530
you would have done your work well till now

53
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,060
that's why you earned this opportunity.

54
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,260
Its better you keep doing your work well..

55
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:01,370
but still,
Its better you keep doing your work well..

56
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,040
but still,

57
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,510
it was You who referred me, right.

58
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,200
All that was needed for that job was a profile

59
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,750
not a name!

60
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,600
Infact, I don't even know your full name.

61
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,860
I hate having personal conversations with office colleagues!

62
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,060
good luck with the project

63
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,200
I don't like a particular set of people

64
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
I'm not sure which "set" that is..

65
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
..may be
the "mediocre"s.

66
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,530
Life is nothing but

67
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,170
the choices we make.

68
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,620
Everything that happened in my life till date -

69
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,930
I chose them!

70
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,860
we met at a business summit 5 years ago

71
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,310
Ram
we met at a business summit 5 years ago

72
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,550
Ram

73
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,570
ideal boyfriend
Ram

74
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:32,620
Ram

75
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,010
good looking, successful and rich!
Ram

76
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,750
good looking, successful and rich!

77
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,710
not that I'm a 'money' person..

78
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,200
but I don't intend to do anything dramatic in life.

79
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,740
I have run out of reasons to delay marrige

80
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,690
is there an expiry date for my independence soon??!!

81
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,920
however, 5 years is a good enough time to take a decision

82
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,150
I'm entering into this new phase with a truly new feeling.

83
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,150
Hi Prakhya!

84
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,810
Hey Bhanu! wassup? long time..

85
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,360
Hey listen!

86
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,550
ya, tell me..

87
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,810
I'm about to get my periods in 2 days

88
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,520
ok..

89
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,520
I just want to skip' em for a few more days

90
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,610
Oh, is Ram coming?

91
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,320
you dont have to do it, you know!

92
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:01,890
No,

93
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,880
ah, then..?

94
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,160
my clients are coming from germany

95
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:05,860
ooh!..

96
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,750
I've a lot of work coming up.

97
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,910
oh, ok ok.

98
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,610
this looks like a lot of stress to deal with right now.

99
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,760
I understand

100
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,510
.ah, I'll just text you the name of the medicine.

101
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,390
Is that ok??

102
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,510
yeah, that should be fine.

103
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,390
yah! ok, whatsapp me.

104
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,740
lets catch up sometime..

105
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,240
yah, surething!

106
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:21,840
take care then.

107
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,290
you too, thank you, bye

108
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,040
bye bye

109
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,760
Hey!! he's here

110
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,820
go, go, go

111
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,480
don't be so cool Bhanu

112
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,240
he came from the US just for you..

113
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,220
you guys deserve each other

114
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,390
go, open the door!

115
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,160
er..Bhanu..

116
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,040
Bhanu, I'm seeing somebody else

117
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,360
haan!??

118
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,640
There is another girl in my life

119
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,550
Since when?

120
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,940
how long has it been Ram??!!

121
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,790
OK, 3 months.

122
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,260
I've been trying to tell you this since 10 days.

123
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:42,390
hang on!..
I've been trying to tell you this since 10 days.

124
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,000
hang on!..

125
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,810
3 months, is it?

126
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,610
its not what you're thinking it is Bhanu,

127
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:50,640
our parents are involved..
its not what you're thinking it is Bhanu,

128
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,910
our parents are involved..

129
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,610
listen! I really tried to make it work..

130
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,480
mm..hmmm..

131
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,140
I even coordinated a meeting between you and my mom

132
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,000
and you were rude with her too!

133
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,140
your mother was sarcastic in asking my age

134
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,260
"same as your son", I replied

135
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,860
she got offended for that

136
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,840
she didn't feel superior

137
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,890
I can't help it.

138
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,570
So, for 3 months - between her and I

139
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,410
you and your mom have been planning as to who's better?!

140
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,690
sshh...Just shut up Bhanu,please.

141
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,040
Ah! I get it.

142
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,290
a 30 yr old independent woman would be

143
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,290
 very problematic for your mom, right?

144
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,890
she needs someone who watches TV serials with her and gossips about relatives

145
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,240
I believe she got one.

146
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,710
She's an interior designer..

147
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,710
as if I care..

148
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,890
ok, now don't even try making me feel guilty.

149
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,860
You know Bhanu, you're miserable

150
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,440
and you know it too

151
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,740
we've been in a 5yr long relationship just for namesake

152
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,510
but

153
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,190
in reality I'm just a convenience for you.

154
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,010
You estimated me - I'm not aggressive enough and so I can bear with you.

155
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,490
that's it right?

156
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,310
but what you don't understand is that
others have expectations too!!

157
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,910
you never understand that!

158
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,840
You think you are too special and anyone would be happy with you..
that's your feeling..right?

159
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,260
For that matter, it is the same for you if its me or anyone else..

160
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,660
you just need a societial show off and to get on in life..that's all

161
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,590
nothing more and nothing less!!..

162
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,060
and yes, I compared, definitely..

163
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,090
but the decision making didn't take time

164
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,540
you know why?..

165
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,310
because she's beautiful,

166
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,360
she's caring

167
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,940
she's understanding

168
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,910
she's polite

169
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,610
and more than anything...

170
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,810
she's 24!

171
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,470
how's the taste?

172
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:11,950
super

173
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,150
nice, right?

174
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,210
you see, I've learnt it.

175
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,130
Manish - afterall who taught you, me!

176
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:16,870
Isha - shut up, you didn't teach me
Manish - afterall who taught you, me!

177
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,630
Isha - shut up, you didn't teach me

178
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,610
Isha - I learnt it by myself

179
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:19,570
Manish - I have to teach you everything..

180
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,290
oh! is it

181
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,670
you remember why I brought this cream?

182
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,930
what??..

183
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,930
I feel perfectly fine.

184
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,290
I've moved on completely and I feel very good

185
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,510
it's his loss anyway.

186
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,210
you know what, what has happened is actually good

187
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,050
5 years of this and now I feel light.

188
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,650
I think its over.

189
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,110
who made this?

190
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,370
Manish - me

191
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:50,830
It can't be him..
Manish - me

192
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,730
It can't be him..

193
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,790
and why are you eating chocolate, you don't like it, do you?

194
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,530
this is all we have for breakfast today

195
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,810
Chocolate is a stress buster

196
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,650
Stressed? who is stressed? I'm not stressed

197
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,770
I know you're not

198
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,630
I'm very happy..

199
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,270
Hey listen, I've got loads of work to do

200
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,830

201
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,730

202
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,030

203
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,730

00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,730

205
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,710

so much shopping! where all did you shop?

207
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,570
first to Inorbit and then to GVK..listen!

208
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,430
there are sales all over so I decided to change everything

209
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,630
I really got irked with all my clothes and  I wanted a change..like a makeover you know,

210
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,630
like a "life makeover"..

211
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,210
ya, ya - you're right!

212
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,760
this one's nice...

213
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,330
you remember the last time we went shopping?..

214
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,910
What's your problem huh!!

215
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,630
Manish...

216
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,170
he can't see me happy or what..

217
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,650
listen, you feel I haven't moved on? I've moved on..

218
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,390
you want me to cry over it?..

219
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,650
stupid guy!!

220
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,650
I deserve somebody much better

221
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,270
You deserve much better than anyone..

222
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:15,460
exactly..
You deserve much better than anyone..

223
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,210
exactly..

224
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,210
forget him

225
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,610
need some more salt? check once akka

226
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,960
is the salt less for wada?

227
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,540
wada? are there relatives at home?

228
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:46,010
ya Akka, Vijaya aunty has come..I'm leaving to Hyd for a job

229
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,490
didn't you have a job at bezawada??

230
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,840
My boss has got me a new and better job at Hyderabad, for my growth.

231
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,260
its time for you get married too..

232
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,460
last time there was an alliance on offer, your dad didn't allow it to happen.

233
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,990
watch out, there's something burning on the stove there..you go!

234
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,460
akka,come here..

235
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,290
where is bujji? is he off to school?

236
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,890
I can't handle him at home and so sent him to school.

237
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:15,960
he should be back by noon.
I can't handle him at home and so sent him to school.

238
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,340
he should be back by noon.

239
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,690
take this and serve him a couple of wadas after he's back.

240
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,360
sister, I've put the money at the idol

241
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,020
I'm leaving, see you.

242
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,960
ok, take care

243
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,310
Brother, where will he stay in Hyderabad?

244
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,750
his friend Chakri's brother is there in Hyerabad
he'll go stay there with him.

245
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,910
Vijayattha, how are you? when did you come?

246
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:42,930
I'm fine, where are you coming from, with a can in hand?
Vijayattha, how are you? when did you come?

247
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,350
I'm fine, where are you coming from, with a can in hand?

248
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:46,400
Amma asked me to get the flour pressed.
I'm fine, where are you coming from, with a can in hand?

249
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,950
Amma asked me to get the flour pressed.

250
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,690
so, she's getting these petty things done by a job holder!!

251
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,760
nothing like that, anyways, you keep talking and I'll be back from a shower

252
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,560
Brother, do you remember our Dhawaleswaram aunty

253
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,990
her daughter..

254
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,510
(daughter of the person who retired from paper mill)

255
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,440
she now works at SBI kakinada

256
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,560
and is earning 35 thousand per month I hear

257
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,390
I feel we should ask her to be married to our Ramakrishna

258
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,010
.he'd turn 33 this year

259
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,810
and its already been late for his marriage

260
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,640
..so if you have any opinion on this, I'll make things move faster.

261
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,490
its just now that he's got a decent job, let's wait for some more time.

262
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,460
last year when <i>Kanakam </i>asked them about the alliance

263
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,510
they backed off saying his was a small time job

264
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,070
now that he'd be earning good, they seem to be all interested..

265
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,070
do not mind her talk

266
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,430
first let him settle down in his job.

267
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,030
thats fine brother.

268
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,970
why are you staring?

269
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:02,330
amma! let me see, did it hurt?

270
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,540
what are you looking at?

271
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,550
go to Kodandarao uncle's house and hand over the chit fund money to him.

272
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,550
If you forget and leave, i need to send your dad there.

273
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,910
during your initial days of marriage, I heard you and Vijaya aunty didn't get along well.

274
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,730
I know, dad told me about it

275
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,730
that it was you who compromised every time.

276
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,790
then, it was for your dad that I soaked it all up.

277
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,130
but now if someone pokes at my son,

278
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,730
I'm not staying calm, not even your father.

279
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,570
how hot and angry you sound!!

280
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,490
go get the suitcase down and start packing your things

281
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,750
go..i say GO..

282
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,310
thank you

283
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,240
one LIT please

284
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,290
Hey! I've never seen you before..

285
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,700
are you here for the first time?

286
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,660
so, tell me..

287
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,710
yah!

288
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,660
so, you were checking me out, is it?

289
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,940
you're totally setting the floor on fire

290
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,410
you wanna dance?

291
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,010
yeah! why not..

292
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,490
usually I don't dance...but after six drinks

293
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,460
unexpected touch..hate it.

294
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,960
I hate seeing myself in this state.

295
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,640
this break up celebration is not for me, I get that.

296
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,110
thats the moment when I lost my self respect.

297
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,910
missing my dad!!

298
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,060
bro!! you came!!..welcome

299
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,130
Hey bunty, how are you?
bro!! you came!!..welcome

300
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,490
Hey bunty, how are you?

301
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,860
I'm fine, come on in.

302
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,150
Actually I thought of coming to the station to pick you but couldn't.

303
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,640
There is a tiffin center down stairs, a pan shop beside that and the coaching center is across the road.

304
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,090
I can get to the coaching center or can stay put at the panshop itself.

305
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,890
So, how's everything at home brother.

306
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,190
everything's fine.

307
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,240
your dad wants you to concentrate on coaching and get a job.

308
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,110
so he's still behind my back!!, how old am I anyway?

309
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:19,060
You didn't enjoy life as your generation didn't have a proper guidance on what needs to be done at every stage of life

310
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,790
but I'm not like you, I'm fully planned

311
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:28,860
these jobs and all, I don't want to go home for every festival and get schooled by Dad for every damn thing in my life

312
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,460
..are there people still living life on those terms??

313
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,060
you won't understand this now.

314
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,910
Your dad is not waiting for your salary.

315
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:42,090
he wants you to settle down and be ready to take over his business so that he can retire and rest.

316
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,260
all these would work with my elder brother, go play at him.

317
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,810
my characterization is different bro

318
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,310
I'm not like him

319
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:53,410
I don't want to hook up with an average looking girl for some easy money or a piece of land or a large family.

320
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,590
I have some set expectations

321
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,570
I will share my long term plans with you later tonight.

322
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,960
you and your silly talks..

323
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,940
anyways! i will bath and get ready

324
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,510
what will you have for breakfast? a subway sub would do?

325
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:05,590
Idli is fine for me

326
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,140
Idli?? ok

327
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,790
Bunty, take money

328
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,340
no bro, I have it.

329
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,440
hey! don't be late

330
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,210
be quick, I don't want to be late to the office on the very 1st day.

331
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,460
plain idly is fine but ghee idly would take time

332
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,560
I'll go with a plain one.

333
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,410
I've got some of the best idiots around me !!

334
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:19,940
Good morning sir!

335
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,340
call me Samar.

336
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,430
I will introduce you to your project manager.

337
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,530
but

338
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,630
you'll have to learn a lot from her, ok?

339
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,760
yes, Samar

340
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,150

344
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,830

I want you to call me Bhanu

359
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,150

361
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,330
concentrate only on work.

362
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,200

363
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:39,010

364
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,810
English makes me shiver in my knees

365
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:51,350

366
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,430

367
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,030

368
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,190
I have been managing it by myself all these days

369
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,890
and that's the reason you are hired.

370
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,310
If I have to manage things, what are you here for??.

371
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,150
I just cant believe it.

372
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,310
haan Munni

373
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,470
Hey Bhanu, you sleeping?

374
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,010
its ok Munni, tell me.

375
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,010
need to tell you something..

376
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,810

377
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:37,010

378
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,760
ok..oh God!

379
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,990
he saw our pic in FB and now he want me to introduce you to him..

380
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,540
now, don't plan any blind dates Muni, I'm in no mood

381
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,710
I'll ping you his contact, its your wish after that.

382
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,430
I'm not a fool to run behind opportunities

383
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,460
neither am I to miss out on one..

384
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,970
I'm going to meet a stranger

385
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,260
this is wierd!

386
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,550
sometimes, panic sets in, even if a guy doesn't look at you

387
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:32,090
especially when you want to believe you are beautiful.

388
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,190
actually Munni is too sweet to say NO

389
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,650
good that I know your cousin, to whom you wont say no.

390
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,090
MBA symbiosis, Pune.

391
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,670
I've floated a company called BUGFIX, along with one of my first cousins

392
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,070
we provide backend support for mobile payment gateways

393
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,290
2016 start up of the year, India Times.

394
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,970
I was called to IIT Kharagpur to share my story.

395
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:03,110
mostly we might go for a public issue soon

396
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,150
well, thats the good side of me

397
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,350
I smoke

398
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,950
i know its bad, so I work out

399
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,630
to let my lungs breath.

400
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,060
My booze goes non stop from Friday morning to Monday.

401
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,730
Friends giving me company come and go.

402
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,490
I spend a lot of money

403
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,150
the idea is to keep it simple

404
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,390
work hard, have fun, nothing else

405
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,850

415
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,390

416
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,390

417
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,050

00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,590

00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,350
need to hire at least 2 Samar

461
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,820
and we should push the deadlines too..

462
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,410
can't afford senior resources

463
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,750
our bench strength has already swelled

464
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:37,990

00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,290

478
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,370
Bhanu is not a guy amma

479
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,190
its a woman, Bhanumati.

00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,700

00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:12,660
He'll cook for us...

542
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:17,150
Isha: call him and see..
Bhanu: no! I'm not getting him home and I don't want him anywhere around my life

543
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,990
hey, don't forget to send the quotation to Parakh and cc to me, ok?

544
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,960
why are you preparing the acceptance data?

545
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,640
Anu was supposed to do it, right?

546
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,640
Anu is on maternity leave from today

547
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,210
and none else has been assigned.

548
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,840
moreover we have a call today

549
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,690
I'm doing it so that there is no delay.

550
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,840
fine, lets take the call.

551
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,160
are the costing reports ready?

552
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,060
hmmm

553
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,190
is acceptance data ready?

554
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,710
won't you talk on the call today too?

555
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,160
how many days will you avoid calls like this?

556
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,690
what if client calls you when I'm not in office?

557
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,140
Hi Tim, how are you?

558
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,900
Hey Bhanu, where are we on the costing numbers?

559
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,040
he's asking for you

560
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,960
Hello Sir!..yes, I'm fine.

561
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:32,830
I have been through the project status files, they look fine.

562
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,890
I've already sent an email and cc'd Tracy as well

563
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,390
I can send it to you again if you like.

564
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,090
Is the acceptance data ready?

565
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,570
ah! no Tim, that's gonna take a while

566
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,500
because we have 4 days off

567
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
so nobody is in office right now

568
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,920
why is everyone on leave?

569
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,960
Is there an occasion or something..?

570
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,460
yah! actually its pongal..

571
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,360
Its like..it's like the Christmas you have

572
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,120
its a big festival in this part of the world..

573
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,840
I didn't know that!

574
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:59,010
so everybody goes out for 4 days - back to their hometown..

575
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,380
I would like You and RK also to take leave

576
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,200
Thanks Tim!

577
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:02,760
Happy Pongal !

578
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,640
see you on monday Tim, bubye!!

579
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,290
I cannot talk in english like you, but I understand it.

580
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,590
Now that the client has said it, why wait?

581
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:24,080
If I take a bus tonight, by morning I'll be relishing piping hot ghee idli!

582
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:33,160
reaching Bezawada  takes the same time by flight and bus!

583
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,620
shall I take Bunty's car and drop you on the way?

584
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,040
Prasad!

585
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,670
yeah Bunty (contextual)

586
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,330
Book a ticket for me to Vijayawada, urgently.

587
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,510
dude, it's festive season - allow me to do my work, hang up!

588
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,130
fine even if it costs more, its utterly urgent.

589
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,360
what's such an urgency? have your festival here itself.

590
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:58,270
the ticket is not for me Prasad! its for Ramakrisha, once he leaves, we can start (the party)!

591
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,270
Ramakrisha? when did he come?

592
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:04,040
details later, first book his ticket and call me.

593
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,890
ok then, call me in an hour

594
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,210
after boarding the bus, if you ask for extra water bottles and soft sheets, you'll be kicked out.

595
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,210
I'll take care of all that.

596
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,700
by the way, this evening, by when would you be free?

597
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,540
I'll wind up once the last bus leaves at 10:30

598
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,280
tag Jogarao along while coming.

599
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:17,940
yeah, done

600
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,200
so, today evening

601
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,690
let it be fun (contextual, past reference).

602
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,130
hang up! silly sot.

603
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,100
come down, let's get sloshed (slang)..ok then, bye.

604
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:26,640
Goa?

605
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,040
yeah

606
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,270
when did you guys go to Goa?

607
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,360
we actually thought of calling you too

608
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,990
but you said you'd be busy at office..

609
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,590
ya but now, Tim, my client has..er..

610
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:40,070
given me and Ramakrishna 4 days leave

611
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,930
..anyways, you guys have fun, see you when you get back

612
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:45,750
hey! so, why don't you fly tomorrow morning?

613
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,040
no, no. you and Manish should spend sometime together, you guys have had enough drama from me.

614
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:54,410
fine then, have a good weekend, I'll see you once you are back.

615
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:55,960
ok, bye

616
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,100
you take care

617
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,100
bye

618
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:38,040
I always saw peace in silence but now it makes me lonely.

619
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,840
I can't stop questioning myself

620
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,840
bro, be quick, the bus will leave soon.

621
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:45,560
hey don't smoke in the bathroom.

622
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,190
take care.

623
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,960
it would have been good if you came along.

624
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,310
your dad will be happy

625
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:59,640
easy bro, I've promised my friend's mom that I would lunch with them tomorrow and she's seriously preparing wada and bobbattlu (festive dishes)

626
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,640
shall I convey anything to your mom?

627
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,640
nothing at all..

628
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,230
missed call from Bhanu

629
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:14,240
Bhanu, you called me..?

630
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,930
this iphone touch really irritates!..

631
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,190
btw, where are you?

632
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,870
about to board tenali bus

633
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,270
pick some booze, tonic will soon be closed.

634
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,410
ok dude

635
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,410
hang on, suresh is calling.

636
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:28,130
even I was contemplating..

637
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,470
if I should go home or...

638
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,900
I told you right, it will be nice if you go home.

639
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,900
your parents also will feel happy.

640
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,590
if we start at 5am tomorrow morning, when would we reach vijayawada?

641
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,270
we should be there by 10.

642
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,690
ok,
see you at 5

643
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:49,670

644
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,530
how long buddy?

645
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,070
I'll send him off and come. I'm not sure till he departs.

646
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,330

647
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:56,330

648
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,330

649
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,360
let's go

650
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,870

651
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,870
Bhanu called..

652
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:07,360
Bhanu and I will be travelling to vijayawada in your car.

653
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,810
lets go home, come.

654
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,530

655
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:16,760

656
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,760
coming..

657
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,930
but with Ramakrishna!

658
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,930
what about the booze if he's coming along?

659
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,100
booze?..

660
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,100
do one thing..from our apartment..

661
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:31,100
go straight, turn right, then left, then take a U turn.. find some bushes and go drink there.

662
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,010
what's your father?

663
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,070
he's into construction (business)

664
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,070
mother?

665
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,700
I feel very happy..

666
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:41,670
all my friends will be waiting for me..

667
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,670
to hear things about hyderabad.

668
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,990
you know,

669
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,670
we have a secret place at tenali..

670
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,670
we catch up at the same spot regularly.

671
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,790
That's where I'll be giving them a drink party.

672
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,730
what will you tell your friends?

673
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:03,390
that you are being given unreasonable work and tortured?

674
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,390
no, nothing like that

675
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,790
I like our office very much.

676
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,790
its got a positive vibe since I stepped in

677
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,790
people there are...

678
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,790
more educated and intelligent than me.

679
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:16,470
while working with them,I get to learn a lot.

680
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:20,440
Circumstances haven't allowed me to learn anything much in life.

681
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,530
now that I'm learning new things at work is very good.

682
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:29,040
I have asked you to take KT from preeti on the new project, right

683
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,040
whats the status of that?

684
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,840
she said it would start after the holidays.

685
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:35,810
ok

686
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,100
forget it..

687
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:40,700
I'll give you the KT,

688
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,160
we shall start from Monday

689
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,670
do you like your name?

690
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,830
yeah, why?

691
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:11,730
why?!

692
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:14,330
I somehow feel your name doesn't suit you..

693
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,330
which one would have been good?

694
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,010
Anjali

695
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,410
Darshini

696
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:20,860
Kavya

697
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,110
Samyuktha

698
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,240
your name should've been

699
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,550
Srinivas

700
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,010
Gopi

701
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,550
Murali

702
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,550
Ravi

703
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,660
Jagadeesh

704
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,760
your name suits you best

705
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,880
"RAMAKRISHNA"

706
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,000
take a patent!

707
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:59,530
this is the first time I've seen you laughing in 3 months.

708
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,300
festivals excite me

709
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:07,040
they have been designed only for us to enjoy them.

710
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,830
you see our mothers during festivals..

711
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:13,170
when they sit before the God and pray

712
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,970
they look cuter than the God himself.

713
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:55,890
yeah, this is my house..

714
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,810
you can park the car inside.

715
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,760
whats your plan?

716
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,930
return after festival or will you stay back for the weekend?

717
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:16,410
no, actually my parents are looking for some marriage alliances..

718
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,870
one of them might get set..

719
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,530
there is a background check in progress, on the girl

720
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,160
once that's done,

721
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,160
we shall confirm the dates

722
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,670
I will mostly come back after the festival.

723
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,800
what about you?

724
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,210
don't plan your return with me

725
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,330
you leave..

726
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,330
my dad will arrange my travel

727
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,370
you seem to have put on weight

728
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:06,040
moms generally tell kids that they've slimmed down

729
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,130
look at you..!

730
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:10,070
girls of your age are married and living happily

731
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:11,010
look at you

732
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:13,010
so what? won't I get married if I get fat?

733
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:14,960
not if you become headstrong

734
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,960
don't talk to me amma!

735
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,700
Ram and you...?

736
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:30,010
fine!,

737
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:32,010
whats happened has happened..

738
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,990
you choose a guy and it didn't work out, right?

739
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:37,560
now give us a chance to look for a guy

740
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,560
amma!!

741
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:41,330
i told you not to talk to me, right?

742
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,330
don't talk to me

743
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,390
you have put on weight it seems

744
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:02,390
yeah, I've got a lot of work at office.

745
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,930
I don't find time for the gym.

746
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:08,410
all the break up stress

747
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,470
its showing off on your food, I see.

748
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,040
are there efforts from your end to meet him?

749
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:22,130
whatever might be the situation,

750
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:24,330
whatever problem he might have had with me,

751
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:27,010
he reminded that I'm 30 dad.

752
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,610
age was never an issue till now,

753
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:34,930
it suddenly came up..

754
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:36,840
by the way Ram is also 30

755
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,760
men!! huh

756
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:42,330
so it means you can stay good even without that guy

757
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:45,440
so..stay like that.

758
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,440
I saw my mom praying innocently and she really looked sweet.

759
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,900
I don't know if he has said it innocently or wisely but he said it correctly.

760
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,470
he's mediocre

761
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,410
for sure

762
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,730
but an interesting mediocre!

763
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,990
Soujanya, take the sweets

764
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:38,990
this is our town's famous jilebi

765
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:41,990
Here is your avakayi

766
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:43,930
and this is gongura (referring to locally famous and home made pickles)

767
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:46,210
hey that's ok..

768
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:49,960
oh,you're back!

769
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,640
you generally don't go home

770
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,640
so I thought you'd stay for 2 more days..

771
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,810
take these

772
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:56,070
what are these?

773
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:57,760
these are kajjikayalu ( sweet dish)

774
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,840
this is kaarappoosa (savoury)

775
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,840
my mom made these

776
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,270
this is our town's famous jilebi

777
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:03,830
you have to taste this.

778
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,240
mail me the SOW by lunchtime

779
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,500
post lunch, work on the reports.

780
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,590
I need everything by CoB

781
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,840
CoB..?

782
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,330
Close of Business.

783
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:22,960
Is it you who drafted this mail?

784
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,960
wassup Ramakrishna?

785
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,270
what's happening in Tenali?

786
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:29,960
people back home said I've got used to Hyderabad well,

787
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,500
I got fairer it seems..

788
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,610
ok, lets meet in the breaktime

789
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:41,660
hey Ramesh, tell me..

790
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,110
you came and left without meeting..

791
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:44,960
it was all very hurried dude,

792
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,410
didn't get time to meet everyone

793
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,070
you were here for the festival?

794
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:48,500
yeah, came for festival

795
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,590
and I had another work too,
will tell you (later)

796
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:52,330
is your marriage set, by any chance?

797
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:54,110
you know I won't marry without you being there, right

798
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:56,150
you have become very busy since you went to Hyderabad.

799
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:58,630
ok, let me hangup, I'm in office.

800
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,190
don't plan any leaves till next month

801
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,730
if you have planned any surprise leaves,forget them.

802
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:11,760
I mean...

803
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,670
what?

804
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:20,210
I've planned to take my parents to Tirupati and also booked online for suprabhata seva 2 months before..

805
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:23,270
fine

806
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:26,870
if you go on friday, will you be back by Monday?

807
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,670
I will go on friday and come back on monday.

808
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:31,670
I too asked the same.

809
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:35,050
you asked me to remind you about the training once we're back

810
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,470
we used to sit at tenali and wonder why people here are paid so high,

811
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,040
I now understand..

812
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,160
its a matter of days for you.

813
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,530
Once you get married,

814
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:48,530
you also will leave everything and jump home at 6pm like everyone else

815
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:50,160
you went home nah

816
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,590
when is your marriage?

817
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:53,590
what do I say about it..

818
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,780
I don't know if I'm even destined for marriage!

819
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,330
what happened?

820
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,640
the one who mediated the alliance

821
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,640
wrongly mentioned my age as 29

822
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,240
I didn't know all these

823
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,260
once the horoscopes were seen,

824
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:09,560
the actual matter came out.

825
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,590
you mean..?

826
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,300
the girl rejected as I was older than she thought.

827
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:20,650
so,

828
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:21,840
because you are older,

829
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:23,840
that girl rejected you..?

830
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,840
mmhmmm

831
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,960
whats your dinner plan?

832
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,190
Its my treat,

833
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:33,210
let's go.

834
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,210
Leave your bike here itself.

835
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:38,530
not to mention, you have a loads of sadism inside you!

836
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:51,870
come in..

837
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:54,070
I'll stay here

838
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:00,130
shall we get to the terrace?

839
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,330
ok, stay here

840
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:17,360
Cheers

841
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,530
you don't drink, right?

842
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:30,360
why didn't you let me know?

843
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,730
I thought it wouldn't be nice if you had it alone

844
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:37,740
its mandatory for men to drink and women should not drink

845
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:39,270
there is no such law! (contextual)

846
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:40,640
its all here (in the mind)

847
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:50,670
whats in your mind?

848
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:54,840
down there..your friends..

849
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,440
Oh, that..?

850
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:00,210
I met Isha in Bangalore

851
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:02,190
back then, I used to go for swimming classes

852
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:04,530
Manish is her boyfriend.

853
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,810
They are in a live-in since an year.

854
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,610
will they marry?

855
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,500
who knows?

856
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,470
if 2 individuals like doing something, there's nothing called wrong Ramakrishna.

857
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:22,810
you talk very intellectually.

858
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:26,440
On seeing you, I wonder if women are this intellegent..

859
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,530
no no

860
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:31,530
I didn't mean it that way

861
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,670
positively speaking

862
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:37,070
take it as a compliment

863
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:40,670
finally

864
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:43,760
you got rejected by a girl and came back

865
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:45,100
is that it?

866
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,500
what if its a girl?

867
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,440
they too have their own tastes, right?

868
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:54,190
I know I'm not a goodlooking guy

869
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:55,840
for 33 years

870
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:58,730
I haven't left tenali

871
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,640
there isn't much money I saved either.

872
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,990
That doesn't mean I look down upon myself.

873
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,240
why because

874
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:11,100
I can work hard

875
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,360
and be contended with what I have.

876
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:15,560
Instead of pointing out my deficiancies,

877
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,730
if I get a girl who can adjust with what I have, I'll be happy.

878
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:26,390
Can't stop outsiders from thinking what they want,

879
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:29,100
but when own relatives look down upon me,

880
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,100
it keeps hurting

881
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,990
as though I have deliberately refused this marriage.

882
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:40,610
Afterall, who doesn't wish?

883
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,210
to have a person in their life?

884
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,530
Ramakrishna, you know Hindi?

885
00:51:58,470 --> 00:51:59,640
a little bit..

886
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:01,190
English?

887
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:02,700
yes, I understand

888
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,700
I saw your FB profile,

889
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:05,800
very nice pictures

890
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,100
especially that girl kissing you in that pic..

891
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,360
you are very cool

892
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,360
nothing like girl kissing..

893
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,760
my friend software..

894
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:15,390
my friend has a software and he made that picture.

895
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:16,510
morphed pic?

896
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:17,870
ya!

897
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,500
so she's not your girlfriend?

898
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:22,210
No girlfriend,

899
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:23,670
I'm looking for marriage

900
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:24,930
direct marriage?

901
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:26,390
yes, direct marriage.

902
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,760
not even half girlfriend?

903
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,000
no..only marriage.

904
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:30,010
oh, how then?,

905
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:30,470
no experience..

906
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:30,980
Isha!!

907
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,160
experince is needed..

908
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,300
Hey Ramakrishna, don't mind.

909
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:51,500
Isha and Manish are on a high

910
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,010
otherwise they are very sweet.

911
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:54,500
that's ok Bhanu.

912
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,500
they might not have seen a person like me,

913
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,800
so I'd have appeared different.

914
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,010
They look good as a pair.

915
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:04,390
That girl, though not fair colored,

916
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,670
has got a glow in her face.

917
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:09,960
how do you be like this, always positive?

918
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:11,930
don't you get bored?

919
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:13,930
I don't think so deep,

920
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:15,700
I get scared.

921
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:17,760
I can't stop laughter

922
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,840
and can't control tears..

923
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,530
just like my mom.

924
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:25,550
People used to scold me when I was a child

925
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:28,660
saying why do you cry like a girl.

926
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,640
After my sister was born,

927
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:33,270
even she used to make fun of me.

928
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:34,920
oh, so you have a younger sister?

929
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:37,100
she's not with us now,

930
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:42,130
she has loved a christian guy and went away with him.

931
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:44,880
This august it'll be 5years she left.

932
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:49,030
What face will my dad put up after that?

933
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:54,840
I guess that's why he doesn't seek any alliance for me.

934
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:01,190
shall I offer you an advice?

935
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:04,360
Not as a boss,

936
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,590
as Bhanu.

937
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,840
If you love someone, respect them.

938
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:15,730
that means respecting their likes/ choices too.

939
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,900
what are you staring at?

940
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:40,840
nothing

941
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:46,130
I somehow feel you are in deep s**t

942
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:47,860
Bunty

943
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,500
I want to learn to converse well in english at any cost.

944
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,320
how old you said you are? 35?

945
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:54,710
no, just 33.

946
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,130
happy for you.

947
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:00,360
when you lived happily without knowing english until now, what makes it so impotrant to learn it now?

948
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:03,490
poor Bhanu!

949
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:08,230
has to take all the client calls as I'm not fluent in english.

950
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,640
so that's it

951
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:13,570
oh!..so now you want to slowly learn English,

952
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,610
and converse with your clients

953
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:18,200
seeing which your boss gets impressed and sends you to US

954
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:20,370
where they think you are capable and ask you to stay back

955
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:23,450
in the meantime you will come to India and marry

956
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:26,090
and later,you, your wife and your future kids

957
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:29,290
will unnecessarily talk in English even at home.

958
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:32,990
we have to like your happy family on FB, is that it?

959
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:37,720
with so many intentions in mind,

960
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:43,360
you act and pose like an innocent fellow.

961
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,010
why are you irritated?

962
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:47,930
what do I say? I'm hungry and that chocolate milk shake has not yet come.

963
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:49,330
ordered right, it'll come..

964
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:50,360
why do you get irritated?

965
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:52,000
that's not the only reason..

966
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:54,720
now a days my friends have started ignoring me.

967
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:58,250
before you came,all of us used to chill at my place itself

968
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,070
but don't know why,they've completely stopped coming.

969
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:06,130
I understood,

970
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,540
its because I'm there right..

971
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,670
moreover I'm elder to all of you, so..

972
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,580
you all feel uncomfortable, right.

973
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,360
<i>I think he's getting it</i>

974
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,190
let's do this.

975
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:25,100
ask them to forget all that,

976
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,910
tomorrow we shall get a nice carrom board from the market.

977
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:30,760
by this sunday evening

978
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:33,210
happily, we'll cook hot pakodi and

979
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:35,030
we will play caroms

980
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,610
and on sundays, we all shall

981
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:44,170
visit Tankbund, lumbini park, birla mandir,

982
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:48,730
wonder la, zoo park, ocean park, imax

983
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:50,730
if we start early, we can go see golkonda also.

984
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,270
Hi

985
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,900
whats up?

986
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:54,790
chocolate milkshake

987
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,240
wow,chocolate milkshake!

988
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:00,500
ok, I'll be back from the washroom.

989
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:05,670
Bhanu loves chocolate milkshake dude.

990
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:07,930
how long has it been since you came to hyderabad

991
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:11,500
3 months

992
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,930
where have you been staying since then?

993
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:15,250
I've been staying with you..

994
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,240
do you know what I love to eat?

995
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,530
you'd eat anything, right.

996
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,670
ramakrishna, lets leave, it's already late..

997
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:25,870
we got to reach inox in this traffic.

998
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:26,990
we'll carry this too

999
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,800
dude, you order another one and have it.

1000
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:30,410
yeah fine, you go,you're already getting late.

1001
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:32,010

1002
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,500
what do you want Sir!

1003
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:39,870
one more chocolate milk shake with extra chocolate chips, extra chocolate sauce and extra chocolate icecream.

1004
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,930
chocolate is finished sir. we have guava if you want

1005
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,900
you mean the Guava!

1006
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,790
..not chips, this is the time to have piping hot mirapakay bajji

1007
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,960
Ramakrishna,

1008
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,670
have you sent the accounts data?

1009
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:30,670
yeah, sent it..got an OK reply.

1010
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,440
ok lets go out.

1011
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,470
we both?

1012
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:36,530
why?

1013
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:38,130
won't you come?

1014
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:44,270
brother, we shall play again..

1015
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:50,390
whose house is this?

1016
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:53,360
you sit here, I'll just go in and come..ok?

1017
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,800
I could see a lot of emotions I was not used to

1018
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,240
they were beautiful!

1019
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:34,300
this person beside me has a world so different than mine!

1020
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,630
didn't expect at all

1021
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:41,390
thanks a lot

1022
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:43,390
sshh,

1023
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:45,810
you are happy right..

1024
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:51,040
if people around us are happy,

1025
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:54,360
we will be happy too

1026
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:59,260
I remember someone saying this to me.

1027
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,040
His name is..

1028
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:03,990
Tenali Ramakrishna!

1029
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:13,100
Anyone who knows you will easily understand that you miss your sister.

1030
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:19,240
but no one ever did anything Bhanu.

1031
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,730
I once again understood that I don't understand guys.

1032
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,590
Yesterday, I saw a new Ramakrishna.

1033
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:58,810
Honestly, i should've been angry, but I didn't.

1034
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:03,760
Ramakrishna, is my print out here?

1035
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,300
will you stop the drama?

1036
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:30,870
or continue being like this?

1037
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:51,190
I'm liking everything he does.

1038
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:53,760
By the way, I'm liking myself too!

1039
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:22,040
girls like guys having sense of humour.

1040
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:26,410
I didn't ask you to laugh..

1041
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:28,410
make others laugh.

1042
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:33,100
Throw some side smiles in between talks..

1043
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:39,670
yeah! like this..

1044
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:44,040
also talk some philosophy in between.

1045
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:58,490
Hi Ravi

1046
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:58,890
Hi!

1047
01:04:59,220 --> 01:04:59,680
how are you?

1048
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:00,340
I'm good.

1049
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:01,720
hows the project going on?

1050
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:02,140
yeah, its good.

1051
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:03,460
its on time?

1052
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:03,940
yes

1053
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:05,660
great! I'm glad you like the work.

1054
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:06,540
thanks!

1055
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:24,890
yeah, ok.

1056
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:26,510
OK, i'll call you later, bye.

1057
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:27,750
good morning Samar.

1058
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:29,810
hey Bhanu..

1059
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:34,490
Bhanu..er..

1060
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:36,490
I saw that appreciation mail..

1061
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:38,490
good job.

1062
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:40,890
thank you Samar!

1063
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:45,570
you know, Ramakrishna has also worked very hard along with me,

1064
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:49,430
he deserves half the credit too.

1065
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:57,630
good job Bhanu

1066
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:06,760
He looks beautiful to me.

1067
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:08,260
not only him,

1068
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:11,340
anyone who is smiling wholeheartedly looks beautiful.

1069
01:06:11,490 --> 01:06:14,370
Beauty is afterall an eye catchy visual, right!

1070
01:06:57,910 --> 01:06:58,560
hello!

1071
01:06:58,590 --> 01:06:58,890
hello..

1072
01:06:58,910 --> 01:06:59,460
where are you?

1073
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:00,840
fat pegion bro

1074
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:03,860
you lied to me that you'll go home after office!

1075
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:05,690
Rakesh came along, so..

1076
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:06,770
don't play around..

1077
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:10,430
you are avoiding me because we are not able to use my place since Ramakrishna came here.

1078
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:12,350
he forced me, so..

1079
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:13,910
cut the crap

1080
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,820
no peace of mind at all.

1081
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:29,560
Bunty, what are you doing here?

1082
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:34,490
you put the cigarette wrong.

1083
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,470
who told you I'm here?

1084
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:40,550
you wore a white shirt right (I could easily spot you)

1085
01:07:41,870 --> 01:07:44,740
feeling low and wanted to have a peg, looks like I won't have that comfort too.

1086
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:49,850
today noon, our office team went out for a lunch

1087
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:51,060
want to have a look at the pics?..

1088
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:52,720
see

1089
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:54,290
see look at this pic,

1090
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:55,880
Bhanu is smiling beautifully right?

1091
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:57,240
Bhanu is beautiful..right?

1092
01:07:57,290 --> 01:07:58,690
look here

1093
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:01,650
and this one here..

1094
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:03,880
generally I don't give free advice to anyone

1095
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:08,740
but since you are a nice fellow and lucky that I'm drunk, I want to tell you something..

1096
01:08:09,230 --> 01:08:10,800
listen carefully to what I say.

1097
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:14,170
do you realize which way you are heading?..

1098
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:16,920
you will feel bad if I say anything.

1099
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:22,030
just between you and me,

1100
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:23,540
you are around 35 right?

1101
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:24,850
33 only

1102
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,850
the difference between 35 and 33 is not 10 years,

1103
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:30,110
33 is also a big number, not a small one.

1104
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:34,340
you think i'm younger to you and don't know anything

1105
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:35,430
I do observe everything.

1106
01:08:35,610 --> 01:08:37,810
daily you comb your hair side ways,today you combed it up.

1107
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:39,720
where is the bottu on your forehead?

1108
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:43,660
face talc, muscles, exercises.. everything have increased.

1109
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:45,460
you think I don't know.

1110
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:47,960
all this is only to get close to that woman,right?

1111
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:51,030
why talk about a girl like that? its bad!

1112
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:54,570
listen to this carefully..

1113
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:57,740
if a girl is married at 22 it means she's cute,

1114
01:08:57,770 --> 01:09:00,890
if she's unmarried at 26, it means she's confused,

1115
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:04,260
if even at 30 a girl is unmarried, it means she's complicated.

1116
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:06,770
complicated?

1117
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:08,200
for that matter

1118
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,200
I'm also of the same age group, isn't?

1119
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,970
your delay is not because of lack of need but due to lack of opportunity

1120
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:18,400
even though she's 30,

1121
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,400
there is a little girl inside Bhanu

1122
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:23,370
and that's her beauty.

1123
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:31,640
she solves all issues at work very effortlessly.

1124
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:36,080
I feel a sense of pride on seeing her.

1125
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:41,030
I still sometimes get amazed by her words.

1126
01:09:43,290 --> 01:09:46,210
Bhanu is well brought up,

1127
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:50,370
she's brought up to be an ideal woman!

1128
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:05,800
come bunty,

1129
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:06,710
come on

1130
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:07,480
sit down

1131
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:08,520
he directly brought her home.

1132
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:11,550
Hi bunty,

1133
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:13,570
you both have a talk, I'll be right back

1134
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:18,530
hi bunty

1135
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:21,970
how is your course going on?

1136
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:24,250
courses are all boring Bhanu,

1137
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:27,800
why because there are not much lady lecturers in the market.

1138
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:29,440
you're funny

1139
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:32,550
this is not fun, the real fun is when my friends are around..

1140
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:35,320
you know, like next generation fun..mmm!

1141
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:39,250
don't mind his words

1142
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:42,380
he thinks ginger and jaggery - both are similar and sour! (contextual)

1143
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:48,600
Ramakrishna's sense of humour is like 6th sense,

1144
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,570
we hardly ever know if it exists.

1145
01:10:51,570 --> 01:10:53,160
but he's good actually.

1146
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:55,160
he makes people smile at office.

1147
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:58,300
his humour is outdated,

1148
01:10:58,410 --> 01:10:59,800
are there still audience for it?

1149
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:07,560
will you take over your dad's business or planning on your own?

1150
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:09,300
before this business, job and all,

1151
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:13,770
I have planned a youthful, beautiful, romantic love story.

1152
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:16,760
I didn't tell this to RK too.

1153
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:21,400
why because, by looks he is elder to us but if he talks he sounds elder to my dad.

1154
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:28,130
this movie had super craze back then.

1155
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:31,160
we used to mass bunk college to go watch this

1156
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:34,870
are you talking about Kushi?

1157
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:37,150
yes, Kushi

1158
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:43,300
were you in college during kushi time?

1159
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:44,930
yea..

1160
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,400
so you belong to that time period!!..

1161
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:52,630
let me see your birth certificate.

1162
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:58,290
was there even a municipal corporation in your town when you were born?

1163
01:11:59,090 --> 01:12:01,960
it means, all these days you managed with makeup..

1164
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:03,960
he's innocent and so believed in all these,

1165
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:08,310
i won't tolerate you cheating him like this..

1166
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:14,360
you hit me or beat me..I'll save him anyhow.

1167
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:24,990
hey what happened? where is Bhanu?

1168
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:28,900
we had an arguement over age and she left

1169
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:30,790
what actually happened?

1170
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:32,490
madam's maintanence is high!

1171
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:35,420
is there any connect between her age and her coverage..?

1172
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:39,040
to a kid like me she says she was in college during kushi

1173
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:41,800
if you ask, she'd definitely discount 3-4 years from her age.

1174
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:43,600
poor girl came for dinner dude,

1175
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:47,270
you blabbermouth..drunkard!

1176
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,830
even I came for dinner bro!

1177
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:54,490
good that it happened..

1178
01:12:55,090 --> 01:12:56,970
hey Ramakrishna,

1179
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,170
come on..come sit

1180
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:02,960
sit down..where have you been?

1181
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:06,120
I'm tired of searching for you

1182
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:08,050
..looking smart

1183
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:08,830
don't pull his leg

1184
01:13:10,190 --> 01:13:11,110
see his dress

1185
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:12,680
what's the matter?

1186
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:15,740
nothing of that sort.

1187
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:17,880
Bhanu came to my home for dinner

1188
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:19,260
I was in the kitchen when

1189
01:13:19,330 --> 01:13:20,910
Bunty spoke some nonsense

1190
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:23,980
you know her anger right?,she left without eating..

1191
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:26,940
I got her food packed,

1192
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:28,940
ask her to eat it later.

1193
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:34,470
Ram, first tell me what's the actual thing?

1194
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:38,010
see, he's changed completely..

1195
01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:39,710
how was he when he came and look at him now..

1196
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,930
his body language and dressing sense,

1197
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:44,030
everything changed -

1198
01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:46,130
village boy to handsome boy.

1199
01:13:46,170 --> 01:13:47,340
yeah, he's become smarter

1200
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,470
can I ask you a question?

1201
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:49,110
what?

1202
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:51,000
you

1203
01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:53,310
both look good (together).

1204
01:13:53,410 --> 01:13:56,350
I mean, nice..nice

1205
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:00,910
you make a nice pair..

1206
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,710
i don't understand these live-in relationship and all,

1207
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:10,090
but...

1208
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:14,570
the thought that you'd one day part ways is sad..

1209
01:14:16,770 --> 01:14:18,800
don't you feel anything??

1210
01:14:23,510 --> 01:14:24,600
Raam!..

1211
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,510
Ramakrisha..you know what,

1212
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,200
you are very good.

1213
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:38,990
Bhanu also says the same.

1214
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:43,090
She came back without eating anything, because of me.

1215
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:44,980
She's been hungry since evening..

1216
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,980
I don't think she'll wake up now

1217
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:49,260
so please ask her to eat once she's awake..

1218
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,740
this is all beacuse of bunty.

1219
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:57,040
Bhanumati has her share of mood swings.

1220
01:14:58,050 --> 01:14:59,530
She just out of a break up.

1221
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,910
She's pretending to be happy,

1222
01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:04,400
but

1223
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:06,070
I know she's not happy.

1224
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,290
don't take her seriously.

1225
01:15:08,490 --> 01:15:10,290
that's perfectly fine

1226
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:14,580
I'll leave

1227
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:15,330
but

1228
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:17,860
ask her to eat..

1229
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:19,870
bye Ram

1230
01:15:20,510 --> 01:15:21,140
Good night

1231
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:21,670
take care

1232
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:53,720
forget it nimmy, read the next mail.

1233
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:56,360
Dear Mr. Ram,

1234
01:15:56,500 --> 01:16:02,260
please find attached the quotation for your upcoming event with a guest list of 500 at Heritage Awali, Mauritius.

1235
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:04,370
there is no need to open the attachment,

1236
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,260
you anyways will have the full information.

1237
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:11,260
hey Ram,

1238
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:11,860
ssh

1239
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:13,510
dad's calling me.. don't talk.

1240
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:15,220
ha dad.

1241
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:17,010
ha Nimmy, where are you?

1242
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:20,650
i'm showing my designs for Arvind uncle's plan.

1243
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:21,970
when will you come home?

1244
01:16:22,850 --> 01:16:24,030
I'll get late.

1245
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:26,940
got to finish all my works before marriage right

1246
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:27,710
so..

1247
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:29,050
ok, take care,

1248
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:29,530
bye.

1249
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:30,390
ok bye

1250
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:34,380
you laughing!

1251
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:39,380
when you said you'll share the marriage budget my dad thought you are a gentleman.

1252
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:43,720
the real marriage would be when he comes to know that you brought me to hotel room like this.

1253
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:47,420
people generally plan honeymoon in Mauritius,

1254
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:48,770
not wedding.

1255
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:51,130
its not enough for me - only if honeymoon is romantic

1256
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:52,390
the wedding should be too!

1257
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:55,490
that too with only those people who really matter to us Ram

1258
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,680
the six month survey you did for this destination wedding shouldn't go waste,

1259
01:16:59,310 --> 01:17:00,600
atleast a documentary should be filmed.

1260
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:03,220
are you making fun of me?

1261
01:17:04,690 --> 01:17:06,950
I even had to take care of your suit measurements..

1262
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:08,970
so irresponsible..

1263
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:11,340
I put my life in your hands,

1264
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:12,370
don't know what's going to happen.

1265
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:14,200
look who's talking

1266
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:16,700
you were gazing at the rearview mirror and applying lipstick when you rammed your car.huh!

1267
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:20,010
that's not lipstick,

1268
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:20,670
its chapstick.

1269
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:24,330
looks like I came from the US for your pick ups and drops.

1270
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:36,310
Nimmy..

1271
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:39,060
Nimmy..

1272
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:45,160
Nimmy, what are you doing?

1273
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,050
what the f**k is happening Ram??!

1274
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:51,310
Bhanu mailed

1275
01:17:51,310 --> 01:17:53,310
looking for a patch up with you

1276
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:56,800
let me just see it.

1277
01:17:57,940 --> 01:17:59,930
do you have anything to do with her?

1278
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:03,360
tell me now itself.

1279
01:18:03,530 --> 01:18:04,600
of course, no!

1280
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:06,040
baby, i don't have anything to do with her

1281
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:06,580
don't touch..

1282
01:18:08,170 --> 01:18:09,540
clear it to me now.

1283
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:12,010
what do you want me to do now?

1284
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:13,370
call her

1285
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,150
what?

1286
01:18:14,610 --> 01:18:16,310
I said, call her Ram

1287
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:18,490
Ram!

1288
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:22,070
ok, fine.

1289
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:36,670
hello!

1290
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:37,240
Bhanu.

1291
01:18:37,570 --> 01:18:38,370
ya

1292
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:42,020
you should have understood whom you are talking to, by seeing the number.

1293
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:42,810
excuse me!

1294
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:45,660
but still, let me introduce myself to you again.

1295
01:18:45,810 --> 01:18:46,910
I'm Nimisha Boppana

1296
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:48,970
Ram's fiancee.

1297
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:55,020
I haven't been taught how to talk to people who break relations for their convenience.

1298
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:57,220
Now that I'm anyway talking to you, let me tell you this

1299
01:18:57,460 --> 01:19:00,350
partners aren't pets Bhanu, to be at your beck and call

1300
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:02,370
By dating a girl like you

1301
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,400
Ram understood the value of a girl like me..

1302
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:06,040
its not me who's saying this,

1303
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:07,060
Ram said this himself..

1304
01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:08,970
you can hear it from him if you like.

1305
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:23,970
chocolate shake,your favourite

1306
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:28,400
who are you?

1307
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:31,330
who are you, I'm asking!..

1308
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:33,860
how dare you open my laptop

1309
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:35,750
..and send a mail from my ID??

1310
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:39,560
One complaint to cyber crime and you'll be behind the bars.

1311
01:19:41,170 --> 01:19:45,090
I thought I was helping a small town guy so that your career would take off,

1312
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:47,490
you are just disgusting!!

1313
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:52,460
If left alone, you'd have been a watchman or security guard with your skills.

1314
01:19:55,570 --> 01:19:57,570
You, but, showed your small time mentality.

1315
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:03,000
Who are you to interfere in my personal things?

1316
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:08,190
you were the one who called up my sister and brought us together..

1317
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:10,200
I thought this was the same.

1318
01:20:12,110 --> 01:20:14,000
are you and I same?

1319
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:21,290
I don't want to see you again.

1320
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:26,270
I'll leave if you are to stay here.

1321
01:20:29,370 --> 01:20:31,770
You would need this job to get married.

1322
01:20:32,490 --> 01:20:34,210
I'm not in such a bad state

1323
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:30,940
why am I like this mom.

1324
01:21:33,290 --> 01:21:34,110
how, you mean?

1325
01:21:34,170 --> 01:21:34,770
like this!

1326
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:38,240
Ramakrisha..

1327
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:41,800
these days will anyone have this name?

1328
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:45,710
whats wrong?

1329
01:21:45,710 --> 01:21:47,710
you are clean as a moon.

1330
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:50,840
I think it would've been better if I hadn't been to hyderabad at all..

1331
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:52,690
really!!

1332
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:58,670
I never desired for something beyond my qualification mom.

1333
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:02,090
But, what to do?

1334
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:04,930
I truly loved Bhanu...

1335
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:06,710
loved her a lot.

1336
01:22:11,710 --> 01:22:13,110
cheers

1337
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,490
tell me a truth

1338
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,390
would you be the same if I had a brother?

1339
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:25,090
what do you think?

1340
01:22:26,030 --> 01:22:27,140
I doubt

1341
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:32,070
the day I saw you born,

1342
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:34,460
I decided I wanted no one else.

1343
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:35,970
You know,

1344
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:38,840
your mom still keeps pestering me..

1345
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:40,150
saying we don't have a son.

1346
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,930
As the same father, I ask you

1347
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:44,660
what's your problem?

1348
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:48,770
You are getting confused over your own choices, correct?

1349
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:51,260
Isha called you?

1350
01:22:54,230 --> 01:22:55,600
I'm scared dad..

1351
01:22:58,550 --> 01:22:59,950
what will people think.

1352
01:23:00,090 --> 01:23:01,020
what's his name?

1353
01:23:07,290 --> 01:23:08,160
Ramakrishna.

1354
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:10,300
you remember,

1355
01:23:10,770 --> 01:23:12,630
that's the name of your Bujji mavayya (uncle) too

1356
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:14,710
RAMAKRISHNA

1357
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,060
the name and person are a total mismatch.

1358
01:23:17,090 --> 01:23:19,160
Bujji mavayya (uncle) is very cool.

1359
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,060
Ramakrishna is also cool dad,

1360
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:24,510
in his own way.

1361
01:23:29,570 --> 01:23:31,110
He's a very good guy dad.

1362
01:23:31,170 --> 01:23:32,910
I spoke harsh with him.

1363
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:35,210
I love Ramakrishna dad.

1364
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:38,370
Anyone would like him.

1365
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:40,820
so whats the problem.

1366
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:42,620
go, say sorry to him.

1367
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:44,760
he isn't here dad..

1368
01:23:45,740 --> 01:23:47,070
he went back to tenali.

1369
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:49,240
go where ever he is

1370
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,770
and say what you intend to..

1371
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:52,340
I trust you.

1372
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:01,090
hello

1373
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:02,430
Isha

1374
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:03,800
get ready

1375
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:06,970
we shall go today..

1376
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:08,050
to tenali

1377
01:24:09,150 --> 01:24:10,040
now!

1378
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:12,010
now??

1379
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:13,840
why don't you go in the morning?

1380
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,240
I fear I'll turn Bhanu again by morning dad.

1381
01:24:28,490 --> 01:24:32,810
all it took was 5 minutes to move on from a 5 year relation and forget that guy.

1382
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:36,040
for a person whom I know for just 6 months,

1383
01:24:36,570 --> 01:24:38,750
I'm travelling 300 km in the middle of a night.

1384
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:42,160
Anyone will be judgemental, seeing me.

1385
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:43,370
Logically that's right,

1386
01:24:43,690 --> 01:24:46,350
but I'm in not a position to believe in logic now.

1387
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:07,160
don't think too much.

1388
01:25:07,370 --> 01:25:09,210
if I were in your position,

1389
01:25:09,310 --> 01:25:10,660
I would've done the same

1390
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:21,460
Happiness isn't the same for everyone

1391
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:23,240
its unique for each one of us.

1392
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,380
Only Ramakrishna knows what my happiness is.

1393
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:28,700
I'm not going for him now,

1394
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:29,950
but for myself.

1395
01:27:43,910 --> 01:27:44,970
when are you coming to hyderabad?

1396
01:27:45,830 --> 01:27:47,060
why did you come here?

1397
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,490
why are you talking like this?

1398
01:27:50,370 --> 01:27:51,510
why don't you speak?

1399
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:53,510
I'm no longer working under you.

1400
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:56,940
I don't have to answer you.

1401
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:00,300
I want to be alone,

1402
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:01,630
so please..

1403
01:28:04,690 --> 01:28:05,510
ok,

1404
01:28:06,290 --> 01:28:08,090
you are very angry on me right.

1405
01:28:11,170 --> 01:28:13,270
Ok listen, I'm really sorry.

1406
01:28:13,570 --> 01:28:15,500
I really behaved crazy,

1407
01:28:16,370 --> 01:28:18,210
you didn't even utter a word in reply.

1408
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:21,830
I should have respected that atleast.

1409
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:25,210
you told what you wanted to,

1410
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:27,840
now please leave.

1411
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,040
did you ever talk to me like this?

1412
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:33,260
just because I came running for you in the middle of a night,

1413
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:34,970
I sound trivial right.

1414
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,300
you don't have to hurt your ego

1415
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:42,000
and listen to what I say.

1416
01:28:44,890 --> 01:28:46,050
Its better you leave.

1417
01:28:47,770 --> 01:28:49,760
how were you when we first met?

1418
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:52,770
you were happy, smiling,

1419
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:55,710
patient, pleasant,

1420
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:57,260
joyful with everyone

1421
01:28:59,090 --> 01:29:00,570
I thought you were special

1422
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:06,210
I actually even treated you specially

1423
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:07,710
I don't know if you got it.

1424
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:11,260
Look at me

1425
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:14,310
its been 2 days I bathed

1426
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:20,120
didn't even eat properly.

1427
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:24,660
I came all the way from hyderabad, that too at midnight.

1428
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:34,470
No one can tolerate me except you I believe.

1429
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:37,700
Don't see it as thinking for myself.

1430
01:29:41,690 --> 01:29:43,100
I too am good,

1431
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:45,550
just that I've increased self respect.

1432
01:29:45,870 --> 01:29:47,520
I'm not calculative that Bhanu.

1433
01:29:50,570 --> 01:29:51,980
I'm a simple man.

1434
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:55,350
I want to marry someone I deserve

1435
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:57,410
and live happily with what I have.

1436
01:29:57,740 --> 01:29:59,880
Please don't make me talk more than this.

1437
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:09,690
more than the mail you sent to Ram

1438
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,470
the fact that you have no feelings towards me hurt a lot.

1439
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:16,930
at the end of it, you don't like me..

1440
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:18,770
is that it?

1441
01:30:20,930 --> 01:30:23,740
You didn't even like my name.

1442
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:27,160
I remember you said it.

1443
01:30:28,940 --> 01:30:30,230
BHANUMATI

1444
01:30:32,030 --> 01:30:33,940
will anyone have that name these days?

1445
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:49,910
you want a young girl, do you?

1446
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:05,690
what do I call you now?

1447
01:31:11,910 --> 01:31:13,340
RAMAKRISHNA.

1448
01:31:15,170 --> 01:31:17,290
Your name suits you the best,

1449
01:31:17,290 --> 01:31:19,590
listen to me and take a patent.

1450
01:31:30,970 --> 01:31:33,060
BHANUMATI RAMAKRISHNA

1451
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:35,060
this is even better.

1452
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:38,980
Shall we patent it?
