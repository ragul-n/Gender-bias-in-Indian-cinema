1
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:12,835
Meka Papa Rao's house
Brindavana Colony, Warangal

2
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:22,534
Why did you draw Janasena party symbol, Priest?

3
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:27,070
This is not Power star Pawan Kalyan's
party symbol, its planet house!

4
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:30,599
25!

5
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:37,801
Guptha, l got 4!

6
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,735
Why did you roll the shells?
- Why did you do roll it?

7
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:44,166
l thought he was playing with shells.

8
00:01:44,332 --> 00:01:48,936
Don't play games with Guptha
as well as with horoscopes.

9
00:01:53,866 --> 00:01:55,734
This is not ordinay horoscope.

10
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:03,736
Whose horoscope this is, Papa Rao?
- My son!

11
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,335
You may feel proud to say!
But planets are shivering!

12
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:09,667
l don't get you, sir.

13
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:12,402
People change their movements
according to their planets.

14
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:15,835
But planets are changing their
movements according to your son.

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,167
What do you mean by it, Guptha?

16
00:02:17,332 --> 00:02:18,933
lt means your bad time has started!

17
00:02:19,232 --> 00:02:21,434
Your planets are too weak, Papa Rao.

18
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,500
You want me use any good tonic, sir?

19
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:26,835
Tonics may give you energy but
your planetay power will not increase.

20
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:31,569
This home which was peaceful
like milk booth till now,

21
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:36,404
it's going to change suddenly
volatile like a polling booth!

22
00:02:37,065 --> 00:02:41,102
All your plans will go hamire
with planetay effect.

23
00:02:41,265 --> 00:02:43,600
Keep it in mind, sister!
You must be vey careful, Papa Rao.

24
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:44,700
Really?

25
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:50,003
Neither Viswanathan Anand failed
in chess nor did l fail in guess.

26
00:02:50,532 --> 00:02:52,567
To tell you in one sentence.

27
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:55,001
Your son is like a fired rocket.

28
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,500
lf we hold, we'll get burnt.

29
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,534
lf we leave him?
- People would get burnt!

30
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:00,267
That's more dangerous, right?

31
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:03,068
Evey step he takes is dangerous, Papa Rao.

32
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,500
Stop!

33
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:43,966
Stop there!

34
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:55,505
Anyone who dares to step fomard
his lines of fate will be wiped out clean!

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,738
lf you carelessly take a step ahead
brushing it aside as just mud!

36
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,934
You'll get buried in mud!

37
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:08,936
Priest will say like that only!
You go!

38
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:11,733
You go, man!

39
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:25,433
Oh God!

40
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:34,570
His looks are innocent...
his words are intelligent!

41
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:39,104
When he hits...its knock-out punches!

42
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:46,501
Without catching the man who took away
my sister, why are you standing here? Come.

43
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,267
Come!
- Stop!

44
00:04:48,432 --> 00:04:49,633
lt seems we mustn't cross this line.

45
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:51,400
lt seems the guy on the other side
is not an ordinay guy!

46
00:04:51,532 --> 00:04:54,067
Who said so?
- That priest says so!

47
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,668
Who is he? Is he such a great man
to take on Babji's men?

48
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:02,369
When he clenches his fist,
even thunders will take cover!

49
00:05:02,532 --> 00:05:05,568
Let him be anyone,
l'll stamp him out!

50
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:11,105
He's not a mud pot to stamp out,
he's a landmine!

51
00:05:11,265 --> 00:05:13,266
Step on it, you'll get blown up!

52
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:15,599
Tell him to come, let's see!

53
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:18,467
ls he a fake priest?

54
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:21,800
Brother, don't beat me.
- What happened?

55
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:22,866
l'm innocent.
- Who told you?

56
00:05:23,065 --> 00:05:30,338
He gave money and jewels
to give this build up to him!

57
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,334
But what's his effect?

58
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:37,068
He promised to pay Rs.5000
if l fall like this smeared with colour.

59
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:39,934
Who is he? Where is he?

60
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,967
15 minutes earlier...

61
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:59,902
l'll call when l bring the girl, be ready!
Okay?

62
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:04,167
Neetu, l've entered the place.

63
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:07,933
Enough...enough...

64
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,734
All of you go out.
l'll come myself.

65
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:12,733
Be on line.

66
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:14,934
How long will you take?
Come quickly.

67
00:06:15,532 --> 00:06:16,532
Here l'm!

68
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,167
You?
- Who?

69
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:24,267
Bridegroom!
- Bridegroom?

70
00:06:24,432 --> 00:06:25,900
Yes, l'm bridegroom.

71
00:06:26,165 --> 00:06:27,299
Who else did you think l'm?

72
00:06:35,232 --> 00:06:38,068
Why are you tensed?
Who is there?

73
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:40,734
l've a surprize for you,
please close your eyes.

74
00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:42,733
Close your eyes, please.

75
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,670
l got this pe_ume specially from
France exclusively for you!

76
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:52,833
Pe_ume?

77
00:06:53,132 --> 00:06:54,666
l love pe_umes!

78
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,234
Fragrance is damn good!

79
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,168
Brother! Someone is taking away sister!

80
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:13,666
Present...

81
00:07:21,265 --> 00:07:24,768
Venky brought me here without hitting
anyone in my place, you know that?

82
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:28,202
l'll use my brain always,
use brawn only if it is necessay.

83
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:30,701
Come...come...get in quickly, Neetu.

84
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:36,468
l'll take them to Hyderabad, get them married
and keep them in Anand uncle's house.

85
00:07:36,632 --> 00:07:39,368
go to my home and inform them,
especially my father, who talks too much.

86
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:40,366
Okay!

87
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:45,432
We missed him, brother!

88
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:54,701
lf he could take my sister
with so many people here,

89
00:07:54,866 --> 00:07:56,767
l'm sure there's a mole amongst us!

90
00:07:56,933 --> 00:07:58,301
Find it!

91
00:07:58,466 --> 00:07:59,667
lt's sister herself, brother.

92
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,903
Yes, without sister's support,
he couldn't have taken a step.

93
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:11,870
Get anyone connected to him like
his parents, friends and relatives.

94
00:08:12,065 --> 00:08:13,399
Go!
- Come on, boys!

95
00:08:17,065 --> 00:08:19,033
A youth kidnaps Babii's sister!

96
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,067
We're getting breaking news,

97
00:08:21,232 --> 00:08:24,568
Babii, who rules over Warangal,

98
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:27,035
a young man has kidnapped
his sister just before her marriage.

99
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,734
This incident has shaken up Warangal!

100
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:33,402
People are afraid of repercussions
of this incident.

101
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:38,704
Babji's men are combing Warangal
for the young man's parents and his friends.

102
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:39,800
Take iuice.

103
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:41,067
Did you see the news?

104
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:42,733
What? Did Kohli hit a centuy?

105
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,800
No, someone has hit Babii on his face!

106
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:47,501
Someone has eloped
with his sister from marriage.

107
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:51,701
When l imagine Babii's face now...

108
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,502
Why should we bother about his troubles?

109
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:10,601
Uncle is dancing!
Did you get the news, uncle?

110
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:13,602
l know, it seems someone has
eloped with Babji's sister.

111
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:14,833
Do you know who did it?

112
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:16,800
Who?
- Your son!

113
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:19,633
Hubby!

114
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:28,269
You were dancing like Michael Jackson,
suddenly fell holding your chest.

115
00:09:28,432 --> 00:09:30,767
Did your son do anything ordinay?
Where is he now?

116
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:32,401
He has left this town, uncle.

117
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:35,735
Babji's men are combing for the
young man's family and friends.

118
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,834
lf they get one evidence,
we'll lose our heads.

119
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Evidence?

120
00:09:39,632 --> 00:09:42,267
What's all this, hubby?

121
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:44,566
Hubby!

122
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,133
What's this, uncle?

123
00:09:47,265 --> 00:09:50,601
He's neither my son
nor l'm his father from now!

124
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:53,635
You're not his friend!
Don't you dare come here again!

125
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:54,399
Go away!

126
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,234
Mother!
- Where are you, dear?

127
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,066
ln Hyderabad, mother.

128
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:04,033
Dear, situation is vey bad here.

129
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:06,000
Don't come here till l tell you.

130
00:10:06,165 --> 00:10:08,667
Don't wory, mother,
l'll stay with our Shyamala for few days.

131
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,100
Okay? Bye!

132
00:10:17,265 --> 00:10:19,967
Why take so much time like a girl?
Do it fast, Shyamala.

133
00:10:20,265 --> 00:10:22,166
ls it ioke to light 108 lamps?

134
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:26,336
lf we do this for 8 weeks,
my grandpa says we'll get a good wife.

135
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:29,235
Trust me and light a lamp,
you'll get a good wife.

136
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,834
l don't have any such sentiments,
you finish it and come.

137
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,401
You'll get such sentiments, l'm sure!

138
00:10:56,599 --> 00:10:58,968
Hey Chandu! Come quickly!

139
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:03,700
Should it blow now?

140
00:11:10,532 --> 00:11:11,199
Come!

141
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,368
Okay, it's finished, right? Let's go.

142
00:11:45,532 --> 00:11:47,400
l'll say good bye to all the Gods here.

143
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:07,836
Something happened to me
after seeing you...

144
00:13:08,032 --> 00:13:12,803
Life is going your way suddenly...

145
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:27,503
The moment l saw you...

146
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:32,437
My heart is in troubles since then...

147
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:37,303
You're before me....
you're behind me...

148
00:13:37,499 --> 00:13:41,469
You're by my side...
you're all around me...

149
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:15,503
Your looks are sharp...
your eyes are intoxicating...

150
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:19,436
You've given me a shot of iniection...

151
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:25,270
You've spread the net with your smiles...

152
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:30,036
My heart got caught in it like fish...

153
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:34,703
Oh God, your complexion is like gold....

154
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:39,303
lt makes me remember you only...

155
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:43,736
How can live anymore away from you?

156
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,403
Girl vey good! Vey beautiful!

157
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,902
l feel sad to kill her too!

158
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,801
But l can't avoid it.

159
00:15:29,332 --> 00:15:30,332
Kill her!

160
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,738
Shankar, don't kill her brutally,
kill her interestingly.

161
00:15:39,232 --> 00:15:42,068
l must see your passion in her murder.

162
00:15:42,332 --> 00:15:46,502
l must see my years of vengeance in it.

163
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:50,269
l must see my years of sadness
on her dead body!

164
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:01,501
So many of you were here,
you couldn't catch just one man!

165
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:06,203
He was careful not to leave any
evidence about his family and friends.

166
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:07,767
He's much better than you guys!

167
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,067
Useless buggers!

168
00:16:09,232 --> 00:16:10,600
Brother...
- Shut up!

169
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,768
l thought you'd take care of my sister
if you become in-house son-in-law.

170
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:21,169
What were you doing when he took
her away from under your nose?

171
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:25,903
You couldn't give just one clue
about his appearance.

172
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:27,566
Clue...

173
00:16:30,065 --> 00:16:31,099
What happened?

Give me your phone urgently.

175
00:16:33,099 --> 00:16:33,599
Where did l keep it?

176
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,300
Sippy, come to the left side of building
with the vehicle.

177
00:16:38,466 --> 00:16:39,433
Quick...okay?

178
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:47,770

You'd have done it.

183
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:20,835
You said he's a goon!
Is he so great?

184
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,268
lt seems he used to sell beedies earlier!

185
00:17:23,466 --> 00:17:24,400
Why are you shouting man?

186
00:17:24,566 --> 00:17:26,834
Hey, it's me Babji!

187
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,968
Who ae you, man?
Where have you taken my sister?

188
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:32,534
l don't know anything, sir.
l swear l don't know anything.

189
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:35,802
Who took her then?
- l don't know him, sir.

190
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:37,467
l came here from Hyderabad
for dropping.

191
00:17:37,632 --> 00:17:39,467
He booked pick up also
but hasn't turned up yet.

192
00:17:39,632 --> 00:17:41,333
Give me his number.

193
00:17:41,499 --> 00:17:43,234
l don't have his number too, sir.

194
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:45,400
Will you give or die?

195
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,434
l think he'll kill me if l refuse.

196
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:50,333
l'll tell some number.

197
00:17:51,632 --> 00:17:53,934
Please take it down, sir.
- Wait a minute.

198
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:55,266
Take it down, boys.

199
00:17:59,032 --> 00:18:00,266
Dial the number.

200
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:04,968
Line is busy, brother.
- Dial again!

201
00:18:05,132 --> 00:18:06,900
Catch him wherever he may be!

202
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,668
Babu, this is 100th episode.

203
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,901
Till now we targeted only family audience.

204
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:17,334
Now we're going to target mass audience.

205
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:20,001
Don't play divisive politics by bifurcating
audience as class and mass.

206
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,166
l'm the lone hero who has fans
in all the centres.

207
00:18:22,332 --> 00:18:23,933
Just tell me about the scene.

208
00:18:24,532 --> 00:18:28,702
Babu, you've eloped with
a goon's sister in Kazipet,

209
00:18:29,132 --> 00:18:30,466
he'll call you on phone,

210
00:18:30,632 --> 00:18:32,567
you must give him a stern warning.

211
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:33,667
Scene is fantastic!

212
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,734
The scene is lively like livewire!

213
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:39,302
That's why dialogues...
- No need of punch dialogue if scene has punch.

214
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:42,267
Give production phone to Babu.

215
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:43,466
Give me the phone.

216
00:18:48,065 --> 00:18:50,066
l'm Warangal Babii here.

217
00:18:50,232 --> 00:18:51,700
l'm Boiling star Bablu here!

218
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:56,003
How dare you elope with my sister!

219
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:58,701
Sister? l would've kidnaped you also
had you been there!

220
00:18:58,866 --> 00:19:03,437
lf you shout, it's frustration,
if l shout, it's sensation!

221
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:06,335
You don't know about me,
if you dare touch my sister...

222
00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:09,168
Touch? l've already lifted her!

223
00:19:09,332 --> 00:19:11,233
lf you've guts, tell me where you are!

224
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:15,169
Are you threatening me?
You can't scare me with your threats.

225
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:16,833
l'm Boiling star Bablu!

226
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:19,334
l'm in Hyderabad Annapurna studios!

227
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:21,701
l'm coming there.
- l'm waiting for you.

228
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:22,900
Will you really wait for me there?

229
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:25,034
lf l tell lie, l'll get wiped,
if l tell truth, l'm hero,

230
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:26,833
come, let's fight it out!

231
00:19:27,265 --> 00:19:27,999
Silence!

232
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:31,867
What acting!
You did a wonde_ul job, Babu!

233
00:19:32,232 --> 00:19:33,199
Fantastic modulation, Babu.

234
00:19:33,366 --> 00:19:35,167
Evey dialogue put dialogue into a dilemma.

235
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:38,168
l told you if l get connected,
l'll rock the scene.

236
00:19:38,332 --> 00:19:40,534
We must appreciate the man
who gave me counters on phone.

237
00:19:40,699 --> 00:19:42,534
By the way who is that artiste
- Tamil actor.

238
00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:43,833
Tamil?

239
00:19:44,566 --> 00:19:46,301
They act realistically.

240
00:19:46,466 --> 00:19:48,267
But we need to tech tem Telugu timing.

241
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:50,801
When will he be here?
- He'll be here by afternoon.

242
00:19:51,265 --> 00:19:53,667
Let him come, l'll give him some tips.

243
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:03,934
Who is Boiling star Bablu here?

244
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,500
Who is it?

245
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,067
Where's my sister?

246
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:15,568
Sister?! Looks like the Tamilian hasn't
come out of the character.

247
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:17,601
l'll show him what it would
be like if l'm involved.

248
00:20:18,332 --> 00:20:21,168
What's the matter, Babii?

249
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,467
Where's my sister?
- l said l raped her.

250
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:26,201
Where's my sister?
- Why are you hitting me?

251
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:29,168
Don't hit as you life,
you must do overlap.

252
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:30,833
Overlap? Where's my sister?

253
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,735
Are you an artiste?
Do you've any sense?

254
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:36,667
Do you have timing?
- Artiste?

255
00:20:37,432 --> 00:20:40,368
l encouraged you since Tamils act naturally.

256
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:43,201
lf not l would've encouraged
Subba Raju or Prabhas.

257
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:45,132
Tell me.

258
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:47,100
Won't you come out of the character?

259
00:20:47,265 --> 00:20:48,332
Cameras are not rolling here.

260
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:49,533
What is he talking?

261
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:51,467
Tell me...tell me...

262
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:52,733
Tell me, where's my sister?

263
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:54,233
ls that only one dialogue for you?

264
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:59,103
lf you get so emotional for one dialogue,
l'm delivering pages of dialogues.

265
00:20:59,265 --> 00:21:00,633
How emotional should l become?

266
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,034
Tell m...tell me...tell me...
- Stop...stop...stop...

267
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:05,167
Hey bull! Tell him!

268
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:06,666
Tell me!

269
00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:13,767
What sister?

270
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:17,036
Hey you dirty rascal!
How dare you push my boss!

271
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:19,000
Bash eveyone here.
- l'm Boiling star Bablu!

272
00:21:19,165 --> 00:21:20,533
l'm a hero!

273
00:21:20,699 --> 00:21:21,699
Kill them all!

274
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:26,168
They killed me!

275
00:21:28,699 --> 00:21:30,667
ls he artiste or goon?

276
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,267
He's hitting me really.
Say cut to him.

277
00:21:32,432 --> 00:21:33,566
To hell with cut!

278
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:35,301
Didn't get it yet?
- What?

279
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:38,735
He's not an artiste,
he's Babji, a big don of Warangal.

280
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:41,501
He thinks you've eloped with
his sister and is here to kill you.

281
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:42,833
Look there!

282
00:21:49,065 --> 00:21:51,367
lf he gets me l'm sure he'll kill me.

283
00:21:51,532 --> 00:21:53,267
l'll surrender myself.

284
00:21:53,532 --> 00:21:54,833
l'll also get saved.

285
00:22:00,632 --> 00:22:01,933
ls he TV serial hero?

286
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:06,468
Sir, please forgive me.
l'm TV hero.

287
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:07,533
l mistook you for Tamil actor
and blabbered nonsense.

288
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:08,967
Please leave me, sir.

289
00:22:09,232 --> 00:22:12,335
Brother, what he says is right.

290
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:16,069
That taxi driver mislead us
with wrong phone number.

291
00:22:19,766 --> 00:22:24,837
He'll be somewhere in Hyderabad,
if we get him, we can find that young man.

292
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,633
Come on, boys.

293
00:22:27,466 --> 00:22:30,635
Sir, l don't mind if Indian police
fail to catch Dawood,

294
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,967
but please don't spare that
wrong number guy so easily.

295
00:22:33,132 --> 00:22:35,467
My fans are there in evey street
of Hyderabad.

296
00:22:35,632 --> 00:22:37,834
lf you want take my help, sir.

297
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,600
Get him into the vehicle.

298
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:46,469
You fools! Telecast of all the
episodes will get cancelled.

299
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:50,502
l'm not afraid of taking on Babji
but l'm scared to travel with you.

300
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:55,601
Today evening please come home quickly.
- Why?

301
00:22:55,766 --> 00:22:56,833
Today is festival of dosas.
- So what?

l've to make dosas.

303
00:23:02,766 --> 00:23:04,134
Sathya's sister is coming!

304
00:23:06,466 --> 00:23:07,800
Why eveyone is so scared?

305
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:09,667
Who is Sathya?
- Don of this city!

306
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:14,470
He has a sister, she looks like Samantha
but she's a dictator.

307
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:17,601
She goes mad on seeing men!

308
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:18,800
She goes mad!

309
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:21,001
You're giving a huge build up!

310
00:23:21,165 --> 00:23:22,766
Come, let's go and see her.

311
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:23,300
You go, l'll not come.
- Come l say!

312
00:23:23,466 --> 00:23:24,433
l'll lose my iob.

313
00:23:47,332 --> 00:23:49,967
Shyamala, she's the girl
who locked me up in temple.

314
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:52,166
Did you see her in temple?

315
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:56,502
lf you smoke, your lungs will go,
if you love her, you'll die!

316
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:57,666
What are you saying?

317
00:23:57,833 --> 00:23:59,568
The girl is beautiful like LCD!

318
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:02,335
But the girl's character is like horror CD.

319
00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:05,134
Pull back yourself.
- Once l decide l don't pull back.

320
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:07,534
What's her name?
- Chandrakala.

321
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:11,068
Chandrakala! How beautiful it is!

322
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,634
Don't fall in love seeing name and frame!

323
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,167
Look at her behaviour once!

324
00:24:17,432 --> 00:24:18,866
You both must hit each other with this.

325
00:24:19,065 --> 00:24:21,467
One who first stops with pain
is the loser.

326
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:23,200
lf l win?
- She'll become your lover.

327
00:24:23,366 --> 00:24:25,634
lf he loses?
- He'll become our server.

328
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:29,335
Server, my foot!
l'm ready!

329
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:33,501
Did l hit strongly? l'm sory.

330
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:34,600
Now, you!

331
00:24:37,566 --> 00:24:38,700
Why did she hit s strongly?

332
00:24:38,866 --> 00:24:40,067
What happened?

333
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:42,733
Nothing...nothing...

334
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:49,967
Okay?
- Now my chance.

335
00:24:55,733 --> 00:24:56,934
ls it scale or rod?

336
00:25:02,432 --> 00:25:03,766
Take this and hit with this scale.

337
00:25:03,933 --> 00:25:06,435
l'll do again.
- Ty it again.

338
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,234
Why are you looking at us doubtfully?

339
00:25:17,699 --> 00:25:18,466
Dropping?

340
00:25:19,466 --> 00:25:22,168
He belongs to Karanam Malleshwari's family!

341
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:26,701
No problem, iust a minute.

342
00:25:26,966 --> 00:25:28,801
Mine is better, take your scale.

343
00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:49,702
You're a like pig! Why are you home sick?

344
00:25:49,866 --> 00:25:52,168
Don't pigs have home?

345
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:58,337
Have you understood now that
it's a nightmare to take on Chandrakala?

346
00:25:59,032 --> 00:26:01,901
Whatever it is, l like Chandrakala's
character so much.

347
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:03,700
lf his brother comes to know,
he'll stamp you out.

348
00:26:04,632 --> 00:26:10,938
Once l decide, l don't care
if it's her brother or AK-47 gun!

349
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:30,101
lf you harm me,
my brother will not spare you.

350
00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:42,168
How can l spare if you cross
my sister's path?

351
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:44,933
No...no...

352
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:51,336
Gift pack the body and
send it to his brother.

353
00:26:51,499 --> 00:26:54,001
lf l go with them, it may ruin my career.

354
00:26:55,366 --> 00:26:58,736
You don't wory, l'll come back soon.

355
00:26:58,933 --> 00:27:00,901
Our 100th episode will be
telecast as scheduled.

356
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:04,035
lf you engage Prabhas Seenu
or Subba Raju in my place,

357
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:06,467
TRP rate will hit lowest ebb!
Bye!

358
00:27:10,065 --> 00:27:13,401
Brother, l got the details of Sippy,
his phone and other details.

359
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:15,501
lt seems he gave wrong address.

360
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:19,834
We don't have any other chance
to find him other than Sippy.

00:27:20,966 --> 00:27:22,400

00:27:25,466 --> 00:27:28,602
He? He ruined my entire career.

364
00:27:28,766 --> 00:27:31,735
Sir, l'll find his address with
my acting talent.

365
00:27:35,232 --> 00:27:36,266
Who is it?

366

Punjagutta cemetey.

374
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,902

00:28:06,532 --> 00:28:09,368

how can l win Airtel bumper draw?

376
00:28:09,532 --> 00:28:11,467

00:28:15,632 --> 00:28:18,401

Why are you shouting?

lt's coming, see it.

383
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,069
Brother, vehicle repair will take 4 days.

384
00:28:32,332 --> 00:28:34,600
Shall l get another vehicle?

385
00:28:36,165 --> 00:28:38,066
Nobody must know we're in the city.

386
00:28:39,265 --> 00:28:40,566
Stop a taxi.

387
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:55,834
Will you ply?
- Cab is my job.

388
00:28:56,232 --> 00:28:57,099
Where do you want to go?

389
00:28:57,265 --> 00:29:01,102
You must go to any place
we tell for 4 days.

390
00:29:01,265 --> 00:29:01,965
Get in, brother.

391
00:29:06,032 --> 00:29:07,400
Your voice looks familiar.

392
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,967
l heard your voice iust now!

393
00:29:12,065 --> 00:29:16,302
You're TV actor Bablu, right sir?
- It's me!

394
00:29:16,432 --> 00:29:19,168
l watch your serial regularly.

395
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,733
Never understood it.

396
00:29:21,366 --> 00:29:26,504
Yes sir, in 4533rd episode,
your act was atrocious.

397
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,600
Stop it, guys!

398
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:30,065
You start the car.

399
00:29:42,265 --> 00:29:43,733
Look here!

400
00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:56,166
What's this?

401
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:58,600
lf he's ignoring an e_raordinay
beauty like you,

402
00:29:58,733 --> 00:30:00,000
he would iust brush aside ordinay girls.

403
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:03,167
Stop...l'll take care of him.

404
00:30:15,332 --> 00:30:17,967
He has insulted you in public.

405
00:30:18,132 --> 00:30:20,901
First time a man as hurt my ego!

406
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:24,101
l'll make him come after me like a dog.

407
00:30:24,265 --> 00:30:25,799
Watch! l'll show you my power.

408
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:49,400
Why did he come here?

409
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:52,802
Pool is the best place to fool him!

410
00:31:23,165 --> 00:31:25,901
Why are you so proud?

411
00:31:26,566 --> 00:31:29,568
l know you're wantonly avoiding me.

412
00:31:29,733 --> 00:31:34,671
Any man's mind would get heated like
microwave oven on seeing my figure.

413
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:38,102
But why are you ignoring me?

414
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:43,933
Proud?

415
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:47,936
ls it the confidence that girls
would fall easily for tall guys?

416
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,168
Do you know who am l?

417
00:31:52,699 --> 00:31:55,368
Sathya...Sathya's sister!

418
00:32:00,499 --> 00:32:03,134
Do you know who am l?
- who are you?
Who are you, man?

419
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:04,800
ACP Shankarnarayan!

420
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:12,334
l've entered this city to kill Sathya
in an encounter.

421
00:32:18,065 --> 00:32:21,768
After coming here, l came to know
about ragging cases on you.

422
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,602
l'll arrest you in a week.

423
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:31,835
Go...go...someday you must
come into my cell.

424
00:32:35,165 --> 00:32:39,369
l feel like laughing out loud imagining
Chandrakala's face in that situation.

425
00:32:40,165 --> 00:32:43,568
l'm always like this, if situation
syncs well, l'll rock the scene.

426
00:32:43,699 --> 00:32:46,768
You rocked but do you think
she'll fall for you?

427
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:54,639
Evey girl would love to fall but
they have to meet the right man!

428
00:32:54,866 --> 00:32:58,636
Chandrakala! l'm sory!

429
00:32:59,532 --> 00:33:02,401
Bad time has entered your life,
that's why he entered your life.

430
00:33:05,532 --> 00:33:08,601
Why are you dull since yesterday?
What did he say anmay?

431
00:33:08,866 --> 00:33:09,900
Nothing.

432
00:33:10,432 --> 00:33:13,168
Chandu, we found a new piece today!

433
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:20,669
No ragging today!
No need to rag anyone.

434
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,601
lt's wrong, right?
- What? No ragging?

435
00:33:22,766 --> 00:33:24,000
ls it you who is saying that?

436
00:33:24,165 --> 00:33:26,133
Nothing, l said no ragging, that's all.

437
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:28,768
We must rag!

438
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,568
Okay, you watch and we'll rag him.

439
00:33:32,733 --> 00:33:33,567
What's your name?

440
00:33:33,733 --> 00:33:35,401
Chintala Seenu from Srikakulam.

441
00:33:35,566 --> 00:33:38,368
Who is your favourite hero?
- Who else? Arundhati sister!

442
00:33:38,532 --> 00:33:40,967
Tell me a dialogue from Arundhati.

443
00:33:45,699 --> 00:33:47,200
Hey Bommali!

444
00:33:47,966 --> 00:33:49,334
You were like a bud!

445
00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:51,567
How come you've become a fat pig!

446
00:33:51,733 --> 00:33:54,702
You left me alone to rot in a mausoleum,

447
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:58,169
are you living happily by marying
another man?

448
00:33:58,332 --> 00:33:59,499
l'll not spare you!

449
00:34:01,933 --> 00:34:03,734
Stop! What's this iniustice?

450
00:34:04,766 --> 00:34:05,766
How do l appear to you?

451
00:34:05,933 --> 00:34:07,567
ls it college or forest?
- Stop it.

452
00:34:07,733 --> 00:34:10,969
They're beating a kid here,
isn't there any man to save me?

453
00:34:17,265 --> 00:34:17,798
What's the trouble here?

454
00:34:17,966 --> 00:34:19,267
What am l to tell if you ask?

455
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:22,034
These girls are troubling
a little boy like me.

456
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,034
Are you little kid? You're like pig!

457
00:34:24,733 --> 00:34:28,903
lf you know how these girls torture boys,
boys must get Abhay law!

458
00:34:29,065 --> 00:34:30,099
Did you've a round already, brother?

459
00:34:30,265 --> 00:34:36,371
You're torturing boys mentally so much,
you've become hardcore elements.

460
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:40,767
Who is the leader of your gang?

461
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:45,967
Venkateswarlu! l think l'll lose
my job because of you.

462
00:34:46,132 --> 00:34:48,634
Getting seat in college is easier
than in a bar.

463
00:34:48,799 --> 00:34:51,801
Do you know why?
Boys have stopped coming to college.

464
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,767
lf kids like them come to college to study,

465
00:34:54,933 --> 00:34:57,101
if you rag them also,
who will dare come to college?

466
00:34:57,265 --> 00:34:58,666
That's how you must ask them!
If not what's this?

467
00:34:58,799 --> 00:35:01,568
Have they come to college or
do cabaret dances?

468
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:04,168
What clothes are these?
Wearing school dress to college.

469
00:35:05,165 --> 00:35:08,234
l'll get angy if you talk about
women disrespectfully.

470
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:09,500
Do you've this angle too in you?

471
00:35:10,632 --> 00:35:13,835
Why are you shivering?
Are you acting after ragging him?

472
00:35:14,132 --> 00:35:17,301
l'm from a vey good family,
l'm scared of police.

473
00:35:17,499 --> 00:35:21,336
Your hobbies?
- Listening music and dancing.

474
00:35:21,499 --> 00:35:24,435
Oh, it seems she can dance.
Please dance now!

475
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:28,436
l'm little shy.
All are watching me.

476
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:29,266
Come here.

477
00:35:30,766 --> 00:35:34,035
When you're alone and
when you there's no one else,

478
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,500
dance as you do then!

479
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:40,503
Then, l've a song, can l play it?
- Rock it!

480
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,499
l think devotional song.

481
00:35:47,766 --> 00:35:48,766
Song from Dookudu!

482
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:13,102
Auto Appa Rao wants to blow horn...

483
00:36:13,265 --> 00:36:16,434
Scooter Subba Rao presses the beep...

484
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:20,402
All the rogues are after me,
what's this tension?

485
00:36:26,799 --> 00:36:30,702
Saidulu wants to teach me
driving in a Maruthi car...

486
00:36:30,866 --> 00:36:34,803
Abbulu wants to gift me
an Innova car...

487
00:36:37,966 --> 00:36:40,435
How is your college, Ammulu?

488
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:45,337
Eveything is okay,
some ACP Shankarnarayan is torturing me.

489
00:36:45,499 --> 00:36:46,399
l must tell my brother.

490
00:36:46,566 --> 00:36:49,302
Stop...stop...ACP Narayan?

491
00:36:50,332 --> 00:36:51,633
He's our man!

492
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:53,200
Do you know this?

493
00:36:53,366 --> 00:36:57,236
We give him more bribe than
what Govt. pays him as salay.

494
00:36:57,399 --> 00:37:00,068
l'll take care of him,
don't take small issues to brother.

495
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:03,502
Leela will take care, leave it to me.
You can go, go l say!

496
00:37:04,733 --> 00:37:08,103
Greetings, madam!
l'm ACP Shankarnarayan.

497
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:13,103
What? Are you ACP Shankarnarayan?

498
00:37:13,265 --> 00:37:18,069
Yes, it seems you told your brother
that l'm torturing you.

499
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:20,067
But that day...

500
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,568
There's some misunderstanding,
l'll talk to my brother.

501
00:37:25,733 --> 00:37:27,734
You can go.
- Thanks, madam.

502
00:37:28,966 --> 00:37:33,637
Had you told him about dummy ACP,
they would've skinned him alive.

503
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:38,869
You've use a fishhook to
catch fish in a pond.

504
00:37:39,065 --> 00:37:43,903
But fish in the basket must be cut
and smear it with chilly!

505
00:37:45,966 --> 00:37:46,933
He's coming!

506
00:37:50,532 --> 00:37:54,736
Maintain the continuity that we still
don't know about his fake identity.

507
00:37:57,666 --> 00:37:59,334
Greetings ACP sir!
- Greetings ACP sir!

508
00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:01,667
Chotu, ACP is here, get a tea for him.

509
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:03,067
l think truth is out.

510
00:38:03,499 --> 00:38:06,802
We've learnt to sing also, sir.
Isn't it?

511
00:38:06,966 --> 00:38:08,267
Yes, we learnt, sir.

512
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:10,201
Can we sing?
- Go ahead.

513
00:38:11,065 --> 00:38:19,173
We came to know about
your secret, O moon...

514
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:25,837
Do you all know that l'm not ACP?
- Yes, we know.

515
00:38:26,165 --> 00:38:29,801
How dare you cheat me!
You dared to touch Sathya's sister.

516
00:38:29,966 --> 00:38:32,068
l'll use your blood as my nail polish.

517
00:38:32,232 --> 00:38:33,833
Please listen to me, Chandu.

518
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,002
Chandu? When did l get so close to you?

519
00:38:37,165 --> 00:38:38,199
Allow me to tell...

520
00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:42,670
ls it Pawan Kalyan's speech
to listen with interest?

521
00:38:43,966 --> 00:38:45,500
What man? Say sory.

522
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:48,335
Say sory...say sory...
- Please listen to me, Chandu.

523
00:38:48,499 --> 00:38:50,300
Don't stretch it.

524
00:38:50,466 --> 00:38:52,167
lf power trips there's inverter in home.

525
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:54,267
lf you lose power in body, no option!

526
00:38:59,265 --> 00:39:02,468
Look, flower plants, glass dolls and girls!

527
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,367
They're cute only if they're sensitive!

528
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:09,670
l slapped only once here, had it been
outside, l would've thrashed you!

529
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:10,433
Come.

530
00:39:11,299 --> 00:39:12,566
Keep smiling!

531
00:39:14,165 --> 00:39:15,299
What was that sound?

532
00:39:16,899 --> 00:39:18,066
Won't it raise noise?

533
00:39:18,632 --> 00:39:19,432
Can l leave now, madam?

534
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:21,434
lf you stay, you'll get another round.

535
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,835
No, l'll leave.
- Go...go...

536
00:39:25,032 --> 00:39:25,665
Come, girls!

537
00:39:39,332 --> 00:39:44,570
Seeing your beautiful eyes,
my heart slipped away...

538
00:39:49,032 --> 00:39:54,170
Seeing your colou_ul lips,
my pulse rate doubled...

539
00:39:56,265 --> 00:40:01,103
When l hear your sweet voice,
my heart yearns for more...

540
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:05,836
When l see your cute acts,
my heart goes bonkers...

541
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,171
Hey girl, don't create panic in me
and ruin my life...

542
00:40:13,299 --> 00:40:20,806
O beauty...O beauty...
You've filled my heart, O my beauty...

543
00:40:56,866 --> 00:41:02,037
Moving your eyes unnecessarily...
You shattered my heart...

544
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:05,101
Get ready slowly...

545
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:11,503
Whenever my heart feels hungy,
you're my straw bery...

546
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:27,982
Come into my arms...

547
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:07,434
You're the hacker who hacks my dreams...

548
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,801
l'm your heart's doctor...

549
00:42:09,966 --> 00:42:13,202
Come and take medicine from me...

550
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:19,570
Turn this boring life with hep and spice...

551
00:42:19,733 --> 00:42:23,837
Come quickly, let's go, my girl...

552
00:42:51,165 --> 00:42:53,267
Brother!
- Call him on phone.

553
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:55,834
That fool's phone is ringing.

554
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:07,704
Don't you know you shouldn't talk
on phone while driving?

555
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:09,567
Pull over.
- Stop!

556
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:16,669
lf you've guts tell me where you are!
- If l tell, will you pluck?

557
00:43:16,799 --> 00:43:18,967
l'll cut you into pieces.

558
00:43:19,165 --> 00:43:22,701
Play guitar before a donkey
not before Godzilla.

559
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:26,769
ln which ever district you may be,
even God can't save your life.

560
00:43:26,933 --> 00:43:30,336
Walk to reduce BP,
diet to reduce fat,

561
00:43:30,499 --> 00:43:34,169
don't challenge me,
it'll reduce your lifespan.

562
00:43:34,632 --> 00:43:36,433
l'll surely get you!

563
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:38,968
Search!

564
00:43:39,132 --> 00:43:41,133
Search, what would you lose? Except money
from your pocket and diesel in car.

565
00:43:41,265 --> 00:43:43,166
Search, you fool...

566
00:43:43,699 --> 00:43:45,200
What is he saying, brother?

567
00:43:45,966 --> 00:43:47,167
Tell me, where do you want to go?

568
00:43:47,332 --> 00:43:48,599
We want to search a man.
- Why?

569
00:43:48,733 --> 00:43:50,201
lf we catch him, we can find another man.

570
00:43:50,366 --> 00:43:51,333
Why don't you catch him straight?

571
00:43:51,499 --> 00:43:52,700
We don't know who he is!

572
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:54,734
Do you know this man?
- We don't know him also!

573
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,434
How can you get him, sir?

574
00:43:59,332 --> 00:44:02,468
There's some mistake in my prayers
this week, that's why l'm tensed.

575
00:44:02,632 --> 00:44:05,634
What happened?
- Why did you slap Chandrakala?

576
00:44:06,032 --> 00:44:09,835
Some girls fall for flowers,
if l give flower, she'll throw it away.

577
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:11,599
That's why l handled her like that.

578
00:44:11,866 --> 00:44:13,334
lt's a different kind of approach in love.

579
00:44:13,499 --> 00:44:15,300
lf she approaches her brother,
and if his men approach us,

580
00:44:15,466 --> 00:44:17,801
l'm tensed thinking about that.

581
00:44:17,966 --> 00:44:21,602
How dare you tease our Ammulu!

582
00:44:22,899 --> 00:44:24,166
Who is Ammulu, brother?

583
00:44:26,366 --> 00:44:27,700
ls her name Ammulu?

584
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:30,435
l didn't want to see two things in life.
- What are they?

585
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:33,001
One, tears in Ammulu's eyes.

586
00:44:33,165 --> 00:44:34,900
Two, thermometer in Ammulu's mouth.

587
00:44:35,065 --> 00:44:36,266
He's going overboard.

588
00:44:36,432 --> 00:44:38,834
l saw tears because of you,
say sory to her.

589
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,837
l didn't tease Ammulu, brother...
- l said say sory, are you narrating stories?

590
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,302
Say sory...say sory...
- Brother...

591
00:44:59,866 --> 00:45:02,668
ls he so strong or the pole is so weak?

592
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:06,169
We can go ahead if we think pole is weak.
Don't loosen up, brother.

593
00:45:08,399 --> 00:45:12,402
Bharathi, you know l don't like troubles.

594
00:45:13,432 --> 00:45:15,167
l came here iust to warn!

595
00:45:16,799 --> 00:45:16,965
Got it?

596
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:20,701
l'll come for lunch,
make 'Guthi Vankaya' dish.

597
00:45:21,432 --> 00:45:23,267
You saw men behind me, right?

598
00:45:25,866 --> 00:45:28,868
They're going to gym for 10 years
eating 10 chickens evey day.

599
00:45:29,065 --> 00:45:33,402
To hit 10 men, you don't need a gym.
You need guts!

600
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,103
l'm telling you again now,
l didn't tease your Ammulu.

601
00:45:40,532 --> 00:45:42,667
l gave her a tight slap!

602
00:45:46,232 --> 00:45:48,701
What's this, Ammulu?
You say he teased you.

603
00:45:48,866 --> 00:45:51,235
He says he slapped you.

604
00:45:51,399 --> 00:45:53,501
lf we don't clarity
when we question him.

605
00:45:54,699 --> 00:45:57,334
How can he slap me?
He teased me, that's all.

606
00:45:57,799 --> 00:46:00,268
No need of discussions,
just go and hit him.

607
00:46:00,432 --> 00:46:05,203
No, if we hit him trusting your word,
slapping you would become true!

608
00:46:05,366 --> 00:46:06,066
Think about that.

609
00:46:06,232 --> 00:46:07,733
Hitting him is not big deal.

610
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:10,834
Then, no need, iust make him say sory.

611
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,668
That's all?
Leave it on me.

612
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:14,433
Thank God!

613
00:46:15,699 --> 00:46:19,269
Just because pole got bent,
don't think l'll also bend.

614
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,868
l'm not a guy who brings a water tanker
for a quarter bottle whisky.

615
00:46:23,265 --> 00:46:27,235
Don't blow a trivial issue into
a big issue, say sory to Ammulu.

616
00:46:31,466 --> 00:46:34,735
You still retain the child in you!

617
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,534
How seriously l'm warning and
he says childishness.

618
00:46:47,232 --> 00:46:48,266
l'll tell my brother.

619
00:46:48,432 --> 00:46:50,167
l'll tell l love you before him also.

620
00:46:50,966 --> 00:46:52,934
Did he say sory, dear?

621
00:46:53,165 --> 00:46:54,432
He said, come...

622
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:55,399
Thank God, he saved me.

623
00:46:55,933 --> 00:46:57,234
l must inform this to Bharathi.

624
00:46:57,866 --> 00:47:01,269
My love, are you fine there?

625
00:47:02,499 --> 00:47:06,536
When l hear you voice on phone,
l feel like Shreya Goshal is singing.

626
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:08,801
How many more people will you cheat?
You shameless crook!

627
00:47:08,966 --> 00:47:13,136
Even if you use bad words,
l can't live without you for a moment also.

628
00:47:13,299 --> 00:47:16,969
You're cheating a girl evey minute
with that dialogue, you rascal.

629
00:47:17,766 --> 00:47:18,366
Not in my phone?

630
00:47:18,532 --> 00:47:19,399
Shameless crook!

631
00:47:19,566 --> 00:47:23,002
Please go little away and talk,
you're disturbing me.

632
00:47:23,165 --> 00:47:25,333
lf you dare come, l'll break your limbs.

633
00:47:25,499 --> 00:47:27,267
Can't talk peacefully on phone also?

634
00:47:27,632 --> 00:47:30,901
lf you don't mind, l've a suggestion, sir.

635
00:47:31,065 --> 00:47:31,732
Tell me.

636
00:47:31,899 --> 00:47:33,800
There's a new App for smart phones.

637
00:47:33,966 --> 00:47:36,368
lf we enter his number,
we can know his location, sir.

638
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:39,335
Please give me another opportunity.

639
00:47:42,966 --> 00:47:43,900
Show me.

640
00:47:44,566 --> 00:47:45,967
This is it, please tell me the number.

641
00:47:46,165 --> 00:47:47,833
2Tell the number.
- Tell his number.

642
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:51,333
Tell me again!

643
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,165
Please tell again.

644
00:48:02,065 --> 00:48:04,066
Give the phone to him,
Iet him see it.

645
00:48:04,265 --> 00:48:04,965
See yourself.

646
00:48:05,165 --> 00:48:07,400
Did you take it down?
- Go...go that side...

647
00:48:07,566 --> 00:48:08,800
What happened to you, you crook?

648
00:48:09,866 --> 00:48:11,634
lt's getting connected, sir.

649
00:48:16,165 --> 00:48:17,099
He's in Madhapur, sir.

650
00:48:17,265 --> 00:48:20,735
lt seems Madhapur, this area!
Check where he is now?

651
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,067
He's in this building only, sir.

652
00:48:23,232 --> 00:48:24,466
ln this building?
- This building only!

653
00:48:24,632 --> 00:48:25,566
Can see it on screen?

654
00:48:25,733 --> 00:48:27,267
We Can...
- Show me!

655
00:48:27,432 --> 00:48:29,433
Wait a minute, l'll catch him.

656
00:48:31,699 --> 00:48:33,333
Dave's cafe!

657
00:48:36,766 --> 00:48:39,468
What this Dave's cafe?
This is Dave's cafe!

658
00:48:44,466 --> 00:48:47,101
l told you to show where that man is!
Are you showing where we are!

659
00:48:47,265 --> 00:48:49,333
Bloody phone!
- No!

660
00:48:51,899 --> 00:48:53,400
Don't know when will they find him?

661
00:48:56,499 --> 00:48:58,601
Why did you come here, sir?

662
00:48:58,766 --> 00:49:00,834
Had you informed, l would've come myself.

663
00:49:01,265 --> 00:49:03,834
l was going to airport,
dropped in to meet my sister.

664
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,167
Hi brother!

665
00:49:09,232 --> 00:49:11,334
l was searching all the day,
are you here?

666
00:49:17,699 --> 00:49:19,167
You told me to tell this before
your brother, right?

667
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:21,534
Not just your brother,
l can say this before anyone.

668
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:34,435
Meghana Reddy?
Her name is Chandrakala!

669
00:49:35,299 --> 00:49:36,266
Chandrakala?

670
00:49:41,299 --> 00:49:43,334
Shyamala, l made a big mistake.

671
00:49:43,499 --> 00:49:46,468
By mistake l said l love you to
Chandrakala instead of Meghana Reddy.

672
00:49:48,399 --> 00:49:49,266
Brother!

673
00:49:55,366 --> 00:49:56,100
Brother!

674
00:49:57,232 --> 00:50:00,101
Did you say l love you without knowing
who Meghana Reddy is?

675
00:50:00,265 --> 00:50:01,833
l thought he's foolish but he's smart.

676
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,001
Facebook love!

677
00:50:04,165 --> 00:50:08,569
Names are theirs but use photos
of beautiful girls.

678
00:50:08,733 --> 00:50:10,835
They're confusing boys, brother.

679
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,067
Frauds!

680
00:50:12,766 --> 00:50:14,734
Thanks for forgiving me, brother.

681
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,334
Take care of sister, brother.

682
00:50:16,499 --> 00:50:17,900
Anyone may tell l love you to her.

683
00:50:23,766 --> 00:50:26,902
Be careful, dear.
l'm going to Delhi.

684
00:50:27,499 --> 00:50:28,933
l'll be back in 4 days.

685
00:50:31,432 --> 00:50:33,167
Thank God, danger eased.

686
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:35,766
How was my act!

687
00:50:36,065 --> 00:50:39,868
Don't you feel shame to talk like a man
and meekly surrender?

688
00:50:40,799 --> 00:50:43,401
At times, you must bend and
at times you must straighten the bend.

689
00:50:43,566 --> 00:50:46,402
But it's unavoidable to play acts
like this for a girl like you.

690
00:50:46,566 --> 00:50:47,500
Sit here.

691
00:50:49,866 --> 00:50:52,501
Whatever you may do,
l'll not fall for you..

692
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,336
Do you know this? You've already
fallen for me without your knowledge.

693
00:50:59,299 --> 00:51:01,534
l'm Chandrakala, l'll not fall for anyone.

694
00:51:01,666 --> 00:51:06,103
Then, do one thing, spend an entire day
from morning to evening with me,

695
00:51:06,265 --> 00:51:07,633
l'll prove that you've fallen for me.

696
00:51:07,799 --> 00:51:10,835
lf not l'll never show my face to you again.

697
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:16,167
Why are you thinking?

698
00:51:16,332 --> 00:51:18,333
Scared of falling for me if you come.

699
00:51:19,399 --> 00:51:20,333
l'll come.

700
00:51:24,766 --> 00:51:26,234
Why did you call him to temple?

701
00:51:26,399 --> 00:51:28,868
He challenged to make me
fall for him in a day.

702
00:51:29,065 --> 00:51:32,368
l'll send him to hospital for a week.

703
00:51:32,499 --> 00:51:33,833
What will you do?

704
00:51:35,332 --> 00:51:36,299
Look there!

705
00:51:40,165 --> 00:51:41,499
Did you see the film 'Chennai Express'?

706
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,935
Shahrukh climbs temple steps
carying Deepika.

707
00:51:46,132 --> 00:51:48,601
Will you climb the steps carying him?

708
00:51:49,165 --> 00:51:50,933
l'll see that he carries me.

709
00:51:51,099 --> 00:51:52,066
What's the use of it?

710
00:51:52,232 --> 00:51:56,502
You mad girl! This is not a film
and he's not Shahrukh!

711
00:51:56,666 --> 00:51:59,335
Before he reaches top,
he'll reach up there!

712
00:51:59,499 --> 00:52:00,733
He's coming!

713
00:52:09,232 --> 00:52:10,166
Why did you call me here?

714
00:52:10,332 --> 00:52:13,268
Today is first day after full moon day,
l visit temple regularly this day.

715
00:52:13,399 --> 00:52:16,835
Let's start our iourney from here.

716
00:52:19,499 --> 00:52:20,366
So, our love will start with
God's blessings, right?

717
00:52:20,933 --> 00:52:22,334
Come...come...
they may close the temple.

718
00:52:22,499 --> 00:52:23,666
Come...come...

719
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:27,634
What happened, Chandu?

720
00:52:28,065 --> 00:52:29,266
My leg slipped.

721
00:52:30,332 --> 00:52:32,167
lt's painful!
l can't walk.

722
00:52:32,532 --> 00:52:33,499
Shall we drop out?

723
00:52:33,899 --> 00:52:37,402
Did you see our love has met
with a brake?

724
00:52:39,132 --> 00:52:40,500
What are you looking at?

725
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,601
By any chance are you thinking
of carying me?

726
00:52:44,332 --> 00:52:46,400
lf you don't have any objection,
l'll cary you.

727
00:52:46,566 --> 00:52:50,202
lf you drop me in the middle,
it may hurt my sentiments.

728
00:52:50,366 --> 00:52:53,001
lf l hold anyone's hand,
l'll never leave it till end.

729
00:52:54,366 --> 00:52:55,100
Come!

730
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,267
What's your weight, Chandu?

731
00:53:00,566 --> 00:53:02,067
She lied!

732
00:53:02,232 --> 00:53:03,366
Did l make a mistake by committing myself?

733
00:53:03,566 --> 00:53:05,701
Not just one or two,
there are so many steps.

734
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,601
Am l hea_?

735
00:53:28,399 --> 00:53:30,267
l can't!

736
00:54:45,833 --> 00:54:49,336
How much you love your wife!
You carried her all the way up!

737
00:54:49,499 --> 00:54:51,200
You both are made for each other couple.

738
00:54:51,366 --> 00:54:52,567
May God bless you long life!

739
00:55:07,332 --> 00:55:11,569
What's this? He respected your sentiment
and carried you all the way up!

740
00:55:11,733 --> 00:55:13,835
l think he loves you sincerely.

741
00:55:16,933 --> 00:55:18,701
Come, we're getting late, Chandu.

742
00:55:26,232 --> 00:55:29,935
Chandu, the time you gave me is over.

743
00:55:30,733 --> 00:55:33,068
l've understood you don't have
any feeling for me.

744
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:35,334
l'll never show up before you in this life.

745
00:56:23,699 --> 00:56:26,701
Don't you feel someone jumped the wall?
- Yes, brother.

746
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,100
Let's go and check.

747
00:56:31,265 --> 00:56:33,800
Look there, he appears like a flower thief.

748
00:56:35,933 --> 00:56:36,900
You?

749
00:56:40,499 --> 00:56:44,469
People are scared to look at
this house in day time,

750
00:56:44,632 --> 00:56:46,667
how dare you enter the house
jumping over the wall at midnight!

751
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:49,635
What to do, brother?
Ragging!- Ragging?

752
00:56:49,799 --> 00:56:50,733
Yes, brother.

753
00:56:50,899 --> 00:56:53,167
lt seems l must jump wall
at midnight like 'Donga Ramudu',

754
00:56:53,332 --> 00:56:54,833
plucking this flower like 'Thota Ramudu',

755
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,235
climb up like Spiderman and
give this flower to Ammulu.

756
00:56:57,366 --> 00:56:58,900
Why should l go through
this torture, brother?

757
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:00,533
Did Ammulu ask you to do it?
- Yes, brother.

758
00:57:00,699 --> 00:57:02,500
Then, Ammulu's word is final,
you climb the wall.

759
00:57:02,666 --> 00:57:05,335
l don't know to climb.
- But we know to help!

760
00:57:08,065 --> 00:57:11,168
lt seems Ammulu his ragging him,
he's not able to climb the wall.

761
00:57:11,332 --> 00:57:14,935
My boys will help him, l'll come
to dinner as soon as he climbs.

762
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:16,500
Get ready omelettes for my drinks.

763
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:19,769
lt's vey difficult to climb,
shall l climb on steps?

764
00:57:19,933 --> 00:57:22,268
You're a Spiderman,
you've to go like this only.

765
00:57:22,432 --> 00:57:24,867
Sweet?
- Not sweet.

766
00:57:25,499 --> 00:57:27,567
What's that?
- Not you!

767
00:57:30,232 --> 00:57:31,399
Let's go for drinks.

768
00:57:39,466 --> 00:57:41,401
Do you know what would happen
if my men see you?

769
00:57:41,566 --> 00:57:43,801
Your men?
Come, l'll show you.

770
00:57:45,165 --> 00:57:47,333
Brother...brother...

771
00:57:47,499 --> 00:57:48,933
Why is he calling us again?

772
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,300
What happened?
- l forgot the flower.

773
00:57:51,466 --> 00:57:53,067
Flower? Search for it.

774
00:57:53,232 --> 00:57:54,600
Ammulu will feel bad.
- Here it is, brother.

775
00:57:55,265 --> 00:57:57,734
Throw...throw...

776
00:57:59,399 --> 00:58:01,067
Thanks, brother.
- Super catch!

777
00:58:01,232 --> 00:58:03,500
Brother, phone!
- l know. It's from Bharathi, come.

778
00:58:04,499 --> 00:58:06,467
Did you see how they were co-operating?

779
00:58:06,866 --> 00:58:07,967
How could they?

780
00:58:08,199 --> 00:58:10,334
Ammulu ragging!

781
00:58:13,499 --> 00:58:16,034
lf l send Hi message
why not reply saying hi?

782
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:20,102
lf it's friendship l would've replied,
it's love, so l took the risk.

783
00:58:21,099 --> 00:58:23,067
lf my brother comes to know,
your life will be in danger.

784
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:27,603
l took so much risk for friend's love,
can't l take this risk for my love?

785
00:58:27,766 --> 00:58:29,033
Don't you ever get scared?

786
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:33,069
When a man is in love,
he knows only love nothing else.

787
00:58:36,699 --> 00:58:38,233
Are you scared?

788
00:58:40,466 --> 00:58:44,102
When a woman is in love,
she knows only love nothing else.

789
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:57,335
By the way, what's your name?

790
00:58:58,532 --> 00:59:01,001
Venky...Venkateswarlu.

791
00:59:28,165 --> 00:59:33,003
Pink lips girl...black eyes lass...

792
00:59:33,165 --> 00:59:37,836
With sweet lips touch me hotly...

793
00:59:38,265 --> 00:59:43,003
Sharp knife like boy...
Suave smart young man...

794
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:47,803
You cleverly turned me into your lover...

795
00:59:47,966 --> 00:59:52,303
Pack your bags...wear goggles...

796
00:59:52,466 --> 00:59:56,903
Come to me hiding from
thousands of pairs of eyes...

797
00:59:57,899 --> 01:00:01,202
Let's hop on bike and go
on long ride of love...

798
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:06,168
Let's sing song of love
holding the microphone...

799
01:00:26,632 --> 01:00:31,370
Strange new feelings...
unknown strange framings...

800
01:00:31,532 --> 01:00:35,269
Got entangled in your eyes
and settled down there...

801
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:42,004
My love, its mischievous dreams...
flowing streams of love...

802
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:46,336
World sees us eve_here...

803
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:52,037
Let our love break the rules...
Let our love matter be breaking news...

804
01:00:52,165 --> 01:00:56,669
Let channels go gaga over it...
Let they make it wall posters...

805
01:00:56,833 --> 01:01:01,170
Let they paint world red through
Facebook and Google that we're lovers...

806
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:48,437
Want to dance hot salsa with you...
Have a blast of fun with you...

807
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:52,436
l don't want to be away from you
for a moment also...

808
01:01:53,232 --> 01:01:58,971
Slowly l spread my wings...
l went mad...

809
01:01:59,499 --> 01:02:02,668
May be l'm in high spirit...

810
01:02:03,699 --> 01:02:06,301
Our heart beats are love symphony...

811
01:02:06,466 --> 01:02:08,868
Our pulse rate is new rhythm in guitar...

812
01:02:09,065 --> 01:02:13,569
l feel like l'm swimming in air
and flying in water...

813
01:02:13,733 --> 01:02:17,837
l feel like l've stepped into
a new world...

814
01:02:37,966 --> 01:02:41,169
lt's TV serial hero Bablu!
- Yes Bablu!

815
01:02:41,332 --> 01:02:44,101
Why did you rape Bhanumathi?

816
01:02:44,265 --> 01:02:45,866
Bhanumathi? Which Bhanumathi?

817
01:02:46,065 --> 01:02:48,367
Are you talking about my old TV serial?

818
01:02:48,532 --> 01:02:50,667
l raped her because her
maternal uncle told me to do so.

819
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:54,002
Will you do if he says so?
- If he says l'll rape you also.

820
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,334
Don't know what my wife is doing now?

821
01:03:02,265 --> 01:03:04,867
Brother, Sippy is cutting our calls!

822
01:03:05,065 --> 01:03:09,068
l've taken loan, that's why phone is on
if not l would keep it switched off.

823
01:03:09,366 --> 01:03:11,901
l'll give the final touch to
your phone calls.

824
01:03:12,165 --> 01:03:13,165
Catch me if you can!

825
01:03:13,933 --> 01:03:15,367
Greetings sir.
- What?

826
01:03:15,532 --> 01:03:16,799
l need your help, sir.

827
01:03:16,966 --> 01:03:21,170
You've become a member of my gang,
l'll do anything for you.

828
01:03:21,332 --> 01:03:22,132
Tell me, what should l do?

829
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:24,200
A man is torturing me by
making phone calls evey day.

830
01:03:24,366 --> 01:03:25,500
You must take care of him, sir.

831
01:03:25,666 --> 01:03:27,334
Call him here,
l'll give him stern warning.

832
01:03:27,499 --> 01:03:30,668
l warned him many times,
he doesn't care about it, shameless man!

833
01:03:30,833 --> 01:03:35,170
Then, what do you want me to do?
- You must show your sadism to him.

834
01:03:35,399 --> 01:03:42,539
lf you stab him many times with dagger,
burn him with acid,

835
01:03:42,699 --> 01:03:46,069
your sadism range must be known
by seeing his body's condition.

836
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:48,367
Call him....call him...

837
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:49,499
Call him!

838
01:03:53,532 --> 01:03:55,333
Brother, Sippy is calling!

839
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:57,367
Give me the phone, l'll talk to him.

840
01:03:59,366 --> 01:04:02,068
l called you on phone,
why are you shouting at me?

841
01:04:02,733 --> 01:04:04,167
Where are you, man?

842
01:04:04,332 --> 01:04:07,935
l called you to ask the same question.
Where are you, man?

843
01:04:08,466 --> 01:04:10,701
Even if l decide to kill you,
l don't have time for it.

844
01:04:10,899 --> 01:04:13,601
That's why l've engaged
a scapegoat to kill you.

845
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:16,235
l'll kill you and him together,
tell me, where you are?

846
01:04:16,366 --> 01:04:20,503
Hey Babji! Whether cyclone hits your place
or you visit a place where cyclone hits,

847
01:04:20,632 --> 01:04:21,799
it's you who will get destroyed!

848
01:04:21,966 --> 01:04:24,501
Then, come to me.

Didn't get it?
Even dogs will play if there are pieces!

851
01:04:33,165 --> 01:04:34,332

854
01:04:38,466 --> 01:04:40,935
Are you going to parks
without searching me?

855
01:04:41,099 --> 01:04:43,434

856
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:46,301

Where are you?

857
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:48,668

Don't invite lions and tigers

Sippy?

865
01:05:21,466 --> 01:05:25,369
Play guitar before a donkey
not before Godzilla.

866
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:31,803
You said he's a goon!
It seems he used to sell beedies earlier!

867
01:05:32,265 --> 01:05:35,601
Walk to reduce BP,
diet to reduce fat,

868
01:05:35,766 --> 01:05:39,269

it'll reduce your lifespan.

869
01:05:41,265 --> 01:05:43,834
ls this short man Sippy?

870
01:05:43,966 --> 01:05:46,201
My rating reached lowest because of Sippy!

871
01:05:46,366 --> 01:05:47,533
Thrash him, brother.

872
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,236
Sir...sir...

873
01:05:53,265 --> 01:05:55,467
Who is he?

874
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:57,067
Tell me, where can l find him?

875
01:05:57,232 --> 01:06:01,502
l don't know where he is
but l know where his father is!

876
01:06:03,132 --> 01:06:05,734
Bring him also with us.

877
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:11,367
He's Sathya, real estate king.

878
01:06:29,099 --> 01:06:29,799
Who is he?

879
01:06:29,966 --> 01:06:33,936
Brother, matter is serious,
they're hitching on bike for two days now.

880
01:06:37,799 --> 01:06:38,432
Brother!

881
01:06:38,666 --> 01:06:40,734
Whoever it may be, kill him now!

01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:46,668
l'll show my face after killing him, brother.

884
01:06:46,833 --> 01:06:47,600
Come on, boys.

885
01:06:48,265 --> 01:06:52,235
Venky, we're roaming so openly,
what if my brother's men see us?

886
01:06:52,399 --> 01:06:53,833
What will happen if they see?
Let them see!

887
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,835
Go fast....fast...

888
01:06:56,966 --> 01:06:59,568
My brother's men are following, go fast!
They may see us, go fast!

889
01:06:59,733 --> 01:07:00,800
Don't get scared, Chandu.

890
01:07:00,966 --> 01:07:04,369
There they are, we got them!

891
01:07:04,566 --> 01:07:08,503
They've seen us.
They're coming for us, go fast!

892
01:07:12,466 --> 01:07:15,168
Bharathi, l'm in a chase scene,
l'll call you later.

893
01:07:18,265 --> 01:07:20,700
Right indicator is on, turn right.

894
01:07:21,499 --> 01:07:23,267
Go...go...

895
01:07:23,432 --> 01:07:24,866
He gave right signal and turned left!

896
01:07:25,032 --> 01:07:26,700
lt's dead end!

897
01:07:30,966 --> 01:07:32,701
Useless driver!

898
01:07:32,866 --> 01:07:33,933
They're escaping, brother.

899
01:07:36,833 --> 01:07:38,467
l'll not leave him.

900
01:07:39,032 --> 01:07:39,799
l'll teach him lesson.

901
01:07:43,032 --> 01:07:44,233
Hello, bother...

902
01:07:47,432 --> 01:07:50,301
l'm sacred my brother may come
to know about our love.

903
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:52,801
Someday he has to know, right?
Why do you get so tensed?

904
01:07:52,966 --> 01:07:55,201
You sit here, l'll order coffee for us.

905
01:08:31,165 --> 01:08:32,933
Catch her, don't leave her!

906
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:34,066
Catch her!

907
01:09:00,099 --> 01:09:02,334
Bring her, boys!

908
01:09:20,899 --> 01:09:26,337
lf anyone enters ring when l'm in swing,
bodies will bounce like this!

909
01:12:13,833 --> 01:12:16,335
How dare you attempt to kill my sister!

910
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:18,767
ls Chandu Babii's sister?

911
01:12:20,733 --> 01:12:26,605
She's my life! If anyone dares
to touch her, l'll kill them!

912
01:12:38,733 --> 01:12:39,467
Come, dear.

913
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:53,836
Venky, Babii's men have taken your father.

914
01:13:09,265 --> 01:13:11,100
Don't you feel ashamed to say
she loves someone?

915
01:13:11,332 --> 01:13:16,370
l sent her to study here in
Hyderabad with you for her safety,

916
01:13:16,532 --> 01:13:20,669
you failed to find who is after her
and who is after her life!

917
01:13:20,866 --> 01:13:24,903
l didn't expect Shankar would
attack like this, brother.

918
01:13:25,065 --> 01:13:28,101
He's not waging war to attack
face to face!

919
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:30,934
We must always be prepared
for enemy's attack.

920
01:13:31,432 --> 01:13:33,934
l said that because
her life is in danger.

921
01:13:34,599 --> 01:13:36,167
Now, she's in love.

922
01:13:36,899 --> 01:13:37,966
How will you stop it?

923
01:13:39,032 --> 01:13:42,301
Brother, l'm not like elder sister,

924
01:13:42,866 --> 01:13:45,268
l never thought of marying
against your wish.

925
01:13:45,432 --> 01:13:46,699
You don't talk!

926
01:13:47,666 --> 01:13:50,402
l promised to get elder sister
married to Bharath.

927
01:13:51,499 --> 01:13:52,600
She went away.

928
01:13:53,866 --> 01:13:59,338
Now l'll get her married to Bharath and
save my promise and honour.

929
01:13:59,499 --> 01:14:00,166
Come.

930
01:14:04,232 --> 01:14:08,402
l don't mind if the man whom
she loves is in her heart.

931
01:14:09,599 --> 01:14:11,400
But he mustn't be alive on earth!

932
01:14:14,966 --> 01:14:17,568
l'll step into Warangal after killing him.

933
01:14:23,432 --> 01:14:24,199
Did you hear it?

934
01:14:24,966 --> 01:14:27,101
lf we say we didn't find him,
brother will kill us.

935
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,835
lf not he'll insist us to bring him.

936
01:14:30,366 --> 01:14:31,533
Already it's summer.

937
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,101
We can't roam in sun.

938
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,535
So, let's tell we've killed him.

939
01:14:40,099 --> 01:14:43,368
Brother, we killed the man
who loved sister.

940
01:14:44,699 --> 01:14:45,499
Yes, brother.

941
01:14:46,966 --> 01:14:47,700
Congratulations!

942
01:14:51,432 --> 01:14:54,868
Babji will not have any tension
with Ammulu's lover.

943
01:14:55,065 --> 01:14:58,334
He's not the cause of Babji's tension,
there's another man.

944
01:14:58,499 --> 01:14:59,266
Another man?

945
01:14:59,432 --> 01:15:04,770
He knew Shankar is our enemy,
he joined hands with him to kill Ammulu.

946
01:15:04,933 --> 01:15:06,167
Who is he?

947
01:15:06,699 --> 01:15:08,000
Warangal Kesava Reddy!

948
01:15:16,499 --> 01:15:21,637
When you work for me,
killing the man l order is justified.

949
01:15:21,799 --> 01:15:26,336
1 But if you attack me, its betrayal!

950
01:15:26,599 --> 01:15:31,837
So, let the man come out
on his own will, that's honesty!

951
01:15:34,165 --> 01:15:36,567
l'll get the phone call in a minute.

952
01:15:36,733 --> 01:15:39,669
l'll know who leaked the plan to Babii.

953
01:15:39,833 --> 01:15:42,936
lf you come out on your own,
l'll forgive you.

954
01:15:44,099 --> 01:15:47,368
lf not, l'll kill you.

955
01:15:56,466 --> 01:15:57,400
Brother!

956
01:16:02,699 --> 01:16:05,902
Mishra! Cut the call, iob is done!

957
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:13,534
Forgive me, brother...forgive me...

958
01:16:14,332 --> 01:16:16,333
l made a mistake,
it'll never happen again, brother.

959
01:16:16,499 --> 01:16:20,903
Will you eat food in my home and
secure his house?

960
01:16:21,065 --> 01:16:21,732
Forgive me.

961
01:16:23,733 --> 01:16:26,068
My home has my compound wall!

962
01:16:26,799 --> 01:16:28,700
My men are around me!

963
01:16:29,733 --> 01:16:31,401
They must be vey strong!

964
01:16:32,232 --> 01:16:33,066
Kill yourself.

965
01:16:51,566 --> 01:16:52,600
Forgive me, brother.

966
01:16:53,432 --> 01:16:58,336
You missed the second chance also.

967
01:17:07,632 --> 01:17:08,432
Kill yourself.

968
01:17:12,499 --> 01:17:13,499
Kill yourself.

969
01:17:21,799 --> 01:17:22,900
Brother....
- What?

970
01:17:23,065 --> 01:17:25,934
Babji has brought back his sister
to Warangal.

971
01:17:29,099 --> 01:17:31,701
Then, nobody can save her.

972
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:47,700
How are you, guys?
- Fine.

973
01:17:47,866 --> 01:17:51,736
You left Warangal to mary off
Babji's elder sister,

974
01:17:51,899 --> 01:17:54,067
have you come back to mary
his younger sister?

975
01:17:54,232 --> 01:17:57,301
What's your purpose?
- You don't need any purpose to love.

976
01:17:57,466 --> 01:17:58,834
This purpose is enough to kill us.

977
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,701
Did you find Babji's sister
to fall in love with?

978
01:18:00,866 --> 01:18:01,833
Didn't you find any other girl?

979
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,902
l didn't love Babji's sister,
the girl l loved is Babji's sister.

980
01:18:05,065 --> 01:18:06,132
What could l do?

981
01:18:06,532 --> 01:18:10,302
Whether we fall on bomb or
bomb falls on us, we get blown up!

982
01:18:10,432 --> 01:18:12,467
Babii is combing city to kill you.

983
01:18:12,599 --> 01:18:15,868
lf he knows you love his second sister,
he'll murder your dead body!

984
01:18:16,065 --> 01:18:17,399
What will you do now?

985
01:18:18,199 --> 01:18:20,167
lf possible, l'll ty to convince
in my style,

986
01:18:20,332 --> 01:18:23,735
lf it's not possible?
- l'll convince him with violence in his style.

987
01:18:30,032 --> 01:18:31,666
How did you know about me?

988
01:18:31,966 --> 01:18:34,068
Who told you l play cards
in Lakshmi Vilas club?

989
01:18:34,232 --> 01:18:35,333
Your son!

990
01:18:42,132 --> 01:18:43,900

995
01:18:52,265 --> 01:18:54,500
My name is Sipana Sridhar.

996
01:18:54,666 --> 01:18:55,833
People call me as Sippy.

997
01:18:56,566 --> 01:18:57,366

01:19:02,766 --> 01:19:05,001
He'll take rest after lunch.
He'll take dinner after rest.

1001
01:19:05,165 --> 01:19:06,599
He only eats!

1002
01:19:09,399 --> 01:19:14,103
Tell me, where is your son?
Tell me.

1003
01:19:16,332 --> 01:19:17,900
Tell me, where's your son?

1004
01:19:18,099 --> 01:19:21,602
l know he's in Hyderabad,
but don't know where he is!

1005
01:19:21,733 --> 01:19:29,006
Fearing you'd kill if you know,
l destroyed evey evidence about him.

1006
01:19:29,165 --> 01:19:31,166
lt means you won't tell me
where he is!

1007
01:19:31,332 --> 01:19:33,467
l swear we don't know where he is!

1008
01:19:35,933 --> 01:19:36,733
Tell me!

1009
01:19:39,599 --> 01:19:43,602
No use in hitting us, sir.
We don't know anything, sir.

1010
01:19:43,733 --> 01:19:46,302
Till i find his son,
you both are staying with me.

1011
01:19:47,299 --> 01:19:50,068
Brother, we're getting late
to Minister's function.

1012
01:19:56,566 --> 01:19:57,667

Are you fine?

The girl is surrounded by many men,

01:20:31,666 --> 01:20:34,168
Be careful, boys!

1016
01:20:34,899 --> 01:20:37,067
lf anyone acts smart,
we'll kill him, brother.

1017

1019
01:21:06,733 --> 01:21:08,668
l didn't expect to see you again.

1020
01:21:08,799 --> 01:21:11,101
Before l could come,
your brother took you away.

1021
01:21:11,466 --> 01:21:12,667
How did you manage to come here?

1022
01:21:12,833 --> 01:21:13,900
This is my native place.

1023
01:21:14,866 --> 01:21:18,669
Who tried to kill you in Hyderabad?
Who were they?

1024
01:21:18,833 --> 01:21:20,668
Do you know Kesava Reddy here?

1025
01:21:20,966 --> 01:21:22,734
l know, he's in this function.

1026
01:21:23,432 --> 01:21:26,234
He tried to kill him.
- Why?

1027
01:21:27,366 --> 01:21:29,801
My brother and Kesava Reddy
are sworn enemies.

1028
01:21:30,466 --> 01:21:34,703
A long feud is running between
our families.

1029
01:21:35,065 --> 01:21:40,069
One day Kesava Reddy came to my house
along with sister and relatives.

1030
01:21:51,265 --> 01:21:53,700
My sister who never made
my wish till now,

1031
01:21:53,866 --> 01:21:56,635
first time in life she wished to mary you.

1032
01:21:57,766 --> 01:21:59,467
She says she'll die without you.

1033
01:21:59,966 --> 01:22:04,570
That's why brushing aside our enmity,
l've come to your home.

1034
01:22:06,799 --> 01:22:08,600
Mary my sister, Babii!

1035
01:22:10,165 --> 01:22:12,333
l said no to your sister many times.

1036
01:22:12,499 --> 01:22:14,934
My brother who promised
my dying mother,

1037
01:22:15,099 --> 01:22:18,802
refusing to mary for our sake,
he told them to leave the house.

1038
01:22:35,699 --> 01:22:39,469
Kesava Reddy's sister committed
suicide unable to bear this insult.

1039
01:22:42,165 --> 01:22:46,836
Babji, you killed my sister
for your sisters,

1040
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:52,271
l'll not take rest till l kill your sisters.

1041
01:22:54,833 --> 01:22:59,837
Since then my brother brought
us up fondly and never married.

1042
01:23:00,833 --> 01:23:05,470
But my elder sister eloped with
someone without thinking about all this.

1043
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:10,335
More than on my sister,
who left us all

1044
01:23:10,466 --> 01:23:14,269
my brother is angy on the man
who took her away to get her married.

1045
01:23:16,833 --> 01:23:19,101
Chandu, l must tell you the truth.

1046
01:23:32,532 --> 01:23:33,733
Come, let's go away from here.

1047
01:23:41,833 --> 01:23:42,967
You made a mistake.

1048
01:23:43,165 --> 01:23:45,700
Unwittingly you committed
a grave mistake.

1049
01:23:46,766 --> 01:23:50,669
lf my brother comes to know
you took away my sister.

1050
01:23:51,733 --> 01:23:53,534
He won't accept our love.

1051
01:23:54,332 --> 01:23:57,501
l can't mary you going
against my brother.

1052
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:01,735
My brother sacrificed his life for us.

1053
01:24:01,933 --> 01:24:05,536
We lost our honour for what my sister did!

1054
01:24:07,099 --> 01:24:09,167
l can't repeat the same mistake.

1055
01:24:11,065 --> 01:24:12,132
You're right, Chandu.

1056
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:16,168
You said whatever is to be said
as a sister.

1057
01:24:17,299 --> 01:24:20,335
l'll do whatever l ought to do
as a lover!

1058
01:24:26,366 --> 01:24:28,534
Turn the car!

1059
01:24:28,699 --> 01:24:30,834
Come in, sir.
- l'm here to come in.

1060
01:24:32,733 --> 01:24:34,601
Greetings.
- Greetings, Babji!

1061
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,936
Fix an auspicious time for
younger sister's engagement.

1062
01:24:38,866 --> 01:24:42,836
Earlier you avoided me and
consulted Jogaiah Shasty.

1063
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,170
Since it ended in insult
you've come back to me!.

1064
01:24:47,299 --> 01:24:50,502
Nothing like that,
you were not in town then...

1065
01:24:50,666 --> 01:24:55,904
lf you're thirsty, don't drink phenol
if you don't get water.

1066
01:24:56,099 --> 01:24:57,400
lt's dangerous.

1067
01:25:01,733 --> 01:25:04,669
Auspicious time is good
but situation is not good.

1068
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:05,500
You mean?

1069
01:25:05,833 --> 01:25:10,204
l mean though you've wealth,
but according to building almanac.

1070
01:25:10,366 --> 01:25:15,070
That's why though you live in palace,
you don't have peace in life.

1071
01:25:15,933 --> 01:25:17,501
Come to the point straight, priest.

1072
01:25:18,065 --> 01:25:21,568
You can't get your sister married
till you live in this house.

1073
01:25:22,866 --> 01:25:23,266
Why?

1074
01:25:23,399 --> 01:25:26,735
You used Bha_a cement
for strong foundation,

1075
01:25:26,899 --> 01:25:29,801
Used Nirlep paints for good colours.

1076
01:25:29,966 --> 01:25:33,269
But never gave a thought about
building almanac rules.

1077
01:25:33,432 --> 01:25:35,400
You've to follow building rules, sir.

1078
01:25:35,566 --> 01:25:36,700
Please come here for a moment.

1079
01:25:36,866 --> 01:25:39,702
You wasted west and neglected north.

1080
01:25:39,866 --> 01:25:41,834
That's why south is taking hea_ toll.

1081
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,736
More over sister is cancer.

1082
01:25:46,699 --> 01:25:48,767
ls sister having cancer?

1083
01:25:48,933 --> 01:25:51,468
What's your name?
- Bunty.

1084
01:25:51,666 --> 01:25:52,967
l think forgot about bear.

1085
01:25:53,132 --> 01:25:58,670
Bear...cancer doesn't mean disease,
it's zodiac sign cancer.

1086
01:25:58,833 --> 01:25:59,733
Zodiac sign?

1087
01:26:00,432 --> 01:26:05,603
According to her sign,
by now she would've fallen in love.

1088
01:26:06,432 --> 01:26:07,499
Yes.

1089
01:26:07,866 --> 01:26:11,002
That not a problem of age.
It's direction problem.

1090
01:26:11,799 --> 01:26:13,033
Tell me, what should l do now?

1091
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:16,268
Shift to a good house built
according to rules.

1092
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,001
How that house should be...

1093
01:26:19,532 --> 01:26:23,736
On the eastern side,
there must a blue swimming pool.

1094
01:26:23,899 --> 01:26:27,068
Entrance must have big doors!

1095
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:33,471
As soon as you enter, right side...
steps must be on left side.

1096
01:26:33,599 --> 01:26:36,134
You told so many things,
why not locate the house also for us?

1097
01:26:36,299 --> 01:26:38,434
He's responsible for your bad luck.

1098
01:26:38,599 --> 01:26:42,469
He has plenty of weight here,
don't let him roam on eastern side.

1099
01:26:42,632 --> 01:26:43,599
Bye.

1100
01:26:46,366 --> 01:26:49,669
Find such a house in Warangal.

1101
01:26:50,599 --> 01:26:51,700
Pocketed red in the first strike.

1102
01:26:51,866 --> 01:26:53,334
lf there's any difference,
l'll shed blood.

1103
01:26:53,499 --> 01:26:55,400
What happened, Nano Shasty?

1104
01:26:55,632 --> 01:26:59,135
Had l said no...no...when you gave
me Nano, l wouldn't have this tension?

1105
01:27:00,699 --> 01:27:03,735
l'm cool but Babii is cruel.

1106
01:27:03,899 --> 01:27:05,433
Why do you wory?
l'll take care of eveything.

1107
01:27:05,566 --> 01:27:09,136
What will you take care of?
If he knows what l said is not true,

1108
01:27:09,299 --> 01:27:11,267
Babii's knife won't show any mercy on me.

1109
01:27:11,432 --> 01:27:16,436
How risk it is to keep granite in
Godrej and Babji in our home?

1110
01:27:16,599 --> 01:27:21,437
Turmeric for temple, sand in beach,
Babji means risk, it's unavoidable.

1111
01:27:21,599 --> 01:27:24,768
Anmay Babji is going enter
my friend's house.

1112
01:27:24,933 --> 01:27:27,268
l'll start the real game now!

1113
01:27:29,933 --> 01:27:30,600
What's that?

1114
01:27:30,799 --> 01:27:33,535
Asking me, what's that?
My body is aching.

1115
01:27:33,699 --> 01:27:37,469
When it's cloudy, it'll rain,
when you get hit, you'll get pain.

1116
01:27:37,899 --> 01:27:39,200
Anybody can say such proverbs.

1117
01:27:39,366 --> 01:27:42,035
l beg you, he's about to come now.

1118
01:27:42,199 --> 01:27:43,533
l'm seeing...

1119
01:27:43,966 --> 01:27:45,600
Please listen to me,
tell me, where's your son?

1120
01:27:45,766 --> 01:27:47,100
Won't l tell if l know?

1121
01:27:47,265 --> 01:27:50,434
l thought he would become my exertion,
didn't expect he'd become tension.

1122
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:53,868
That's why l burnt his photos also,
there's no photo evidence also.

1123
01:27:55,733 --> 01:27:57,334
Then, l've an idea.
- What's that?

1124
01:27:57,499 --> 01:27:59,767
l've my father's photo
when he was young.

1125
01:27:59,933 --> 01:28:01,467
Here's his photo.

1126
01:28:01,632 --> 01:28:09,639
Show him this and say he's your son,
he'll believe us and free us from custody.

1127
01:28:13,065 --> 01:28:16,301
lf your plan works and
if we go out from here,

1128
01:28:16,466 --> 01:28:18,401
we both can have a blast together!

1129
01:28:22,766 --> 01:28:24,100
Hit excellently.

1130
01:28:29,566 --> 01:28:30,533
What?

1131
01:28:30,933 --> 01:28:31,967
Why have you both come together?

1132
01:28:32,132 --> 01:28:34,400
To have a talk with you, sir.

1133
01:28:35,199 --> 01:28:40,170
Last night we both a good discussion
and took a decision.

1134
01:28:40,966 --> 01:28:41,800
What's that?

1135
01:28:41,966 --> 01:28:47,504
More than the love l've for my son,
the love you've for your sister dominated it.

1136
01:28:48,165 --> 01:28:49,733
What my son did was wrong!

1137
01:28:49,899 --> 01:28:52,268
That's why we wanted to show his photo.

1138
01:28:52,432 --> 01:28:53,566
Are you telling the truth?

1139
01:28:53,733 --> 01:28:55,768
l don't know if missing Malaysian flight
is found or not.

1140
01:28:55,933 --> 01:28:58,302
But l'm sure you can find my son
with this proof.

1141
01:28:58,466 --> 01:28:59,400
See this!

1142
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:11,333
Why is your son like him?

1143
01:29:12,265 --> 01:29:15,601
l mean, Charminar has four minarets.

1144
01:29:15,766 --> 01:29:17,067
Tai Mahal too has four minarets.

1145
01:29:17,232 --> 01:29:19,067
Can Tai become Charminar for that?

1146
01:29:19,332 --> 01:29:20,166
You're right.

1147
01:29:20,532 --> 01:29:23,835
l don't know how to repay my gratitude
for your generous help?

1148
01:29:24,599 --> 01:29:25,833
l'm letting you off.

1149
01:29:26,099 --> 01:29:26,732
Go!

1150
01:29:26,866 --> 01:29:30,469
Sir, after savouring the delectable
biyani you served us evey day,

1151
01:29:30,632 --> 01:29:32,834
l don't feel like leaving this house.

1152
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:33,633
What's this, Puppy?

1153
01:29:33,766 --> 01:29:37,302
Can we remain in the theatre after
the show even if you love the film?

1154
01:29:37,466 --> 01:29:39,401
He told us to go, right?
Let's go.

1155
01:29:39,566 --> 01:29:43,369
Hey, you both are quite interesting characters.

1156
01:29:44,165 --> 01:29:48,969
We both can have a blast together!

1157
01:29:51,699 --> 01:29:54,535
Did you overhear eveything, sir?

1158
01:29:54,699 --> 01:29:58,803
lf you ty anything silly like
this to escape...

1159
01:29:58,933 --> 01:30:00,000
Got it?

1160
01:30:00,165 --> 01:30:01,533
Go away.
- We'll go, sir.

1161
01:30:03,432 --> 01:30:05,734
Brother, we found the house we want.

1162
01:30:05,899 --> 01:30:08,668
Nano Shasty says better to shift today itself.

1163
01:30:23,699 --> 01:30:26,802
Welcome, sir...welcome...

1164
01:30:30,632 --> 01:30:31,366
You!

1165
01:30:31,733 --> 01:30:32,733
Who is he?

1166
01:30:33,132 --> 01:30:34,066
Owner of this house.

1167
01:30:34,299 --> 01:30:35,833
He'll stay here along with us.

1168
01:30:36,132 --> 01:30:37,399
Bring them also.

1169
01:30:37,566 --> 01:30:39,134
Don't know to whose house
they're taking us?

1170
01:30:39,299 --> 01:30:40,833
Let it be anyone's house,
why should we bother?

1171
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,236
We'll have a separate room,
they need us, right?- Yes.

1172
01:30:44,399 --> 01:30:47,301
Your father is also coming.
Truth may get out!

1173
01:30:47,466 --> 01:30:51,236
lf they've their script,
l've a script of my own.

1174
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:54,233
What's this, Puppy?

1175
01:30:57,899 --> 01:31:01,068
l feel like l've hugged this
personality already.

1176
01:31:01,532 --> 01:31:03,634
Are you Katrina Kaif that eveyone will hug?

1177
01:31:03,766 --> 01:31:04,733
Please come in.

1178
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:14,168
Why did you stop here, madam?
Step into home with your right leg first.

1179
01:31:20,799 --> 01:31:22,734
Please come in.
- The house is vey nice.

1180
01:31:23,899 --> 01:31:25,433
What's this? You're too much.

1181
01:31:25,599 --> 01:31:27,267
The house was my mother's dowy gift.

1182
01:31:27,432 --> 01:31:28,533
lnterior is my father's taste.

1183
01:31:28,699 --> 01:31:29,966
l think this voice is familiar.

1184
01:31:30,399 --> 01:31:33,301
Why is he coming like Dasaratha
where ever any sound comes?

1185
01:31:33,466 --> 01:31:36,502
l don't know if he's Dasaratha or not.

1186
01:31:36,733 --> 01:31:39,869
But his son is demon Narakasura.
He'll die in my hands.

1187
01:31:40,032 --> 01:31:42,100
You've entered a new home,
why do you talk bad about others, sir?

1188
01:31:42,265 --> 01:31:43,866
Leave him, you come inside.

1189
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:45,734
Come.

1190
01:31:48,366 --> 01:31:49,333
l'm watching!

1191
01:31:49,499 --> 01:31:50,766
l can't see anything, sir.

1192
01:31:50,933 --> 01:31:52,734
Who hit me now? Lady?

1193
01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:57,570
Bunty, throw them into a dark room.
- Okay, brother.

1194
01:32:01,265 --> 01:32:04,501
Power cut!- Power cut, Sippy!
- Switch on generator.- This is the right time.

1195
01:32:04,666 --> 01:32:07,335
Let's escape.
Come...come...

1196
01:32:16,899 --> 01:32:20,602
We're on the highway!
It means we're in my town.

1197
01:32:20,766 --> 01:32:25,604
Then, okay, you go to your home,
l'll walk back to Hyderabad.

1198
01:32:25,766 --> 01:32:27,267
You came this far, will you go
without visiting my home?

1199
01:32:27,432 --> 01:32:29,167
Why? l'll not come, l'll go.

1200
01:32:29,632 --> 01:32:33,335
l'll serve you good food, take rest
tonight and go tomorrow morning.

1201
01:32:38,532 --> 01:32:41,701
Though no map, you brought us
to your home only.

1202
01:32:41,866 --> 01:32:44,735
Lion doesn't need address
to roam in forest.

1203
01:32:45,899 --> 01:32:48,501
When l imagine Babji's face now...
- Shut up!

1204
01:32:48,799 --> 01:32:51,268
We're enjoying the success,
why do you take his name now?

1205
01:32:51,432 --> 01:32:54,168
He grew tall like a palm tree,
could he catch us when we ran away?

1206
01:32:57,899 --> 01:32:59,834
Whatever it is,
ours is a hit combination.

1207
01:33:00,399 --> 01:33:03,702
You wait here, l'll order crab cury
and fish gra_ for us,

1208
01:33:03,866 --> 01:33:05,801
l'll get night dress for us.

1209
01:33:08,165 --> 01:33:09,566
Wear it.

1210
01:33:13,165 --> 01:33:14,799
Power is restored.

1211
01:33:15,666 --> 01:33:18,802
Did you order prawn cury?
- Can l forget it?

1212
01:33:31,099 --> 01:33:32,600
To whose house did you bring me?

1213
01:33:33,499 --> 01:33:36,835
You boasted about crabs,
fishes and prawns.

1214
01:33:36,966 --> 01:33:38,701
Why did you bring me to his house?

1215
01:33:39,432 --> 01:33:40,833
That's what l'm also confused.

1216
01:33:44,132 --> 01:33:46,234
Why did you run away and
why did you come back?

1217
01:33:46,399 --> 01:33:51,804
We didn't run away, since there's
no power, we went for candles.

1218
01:33:51,966 --> 01:33:53,567
We hit the highway!

1219
01:33:53,733 --> 01:33:54,767
We lost the way.

1220
01:33:54,933 --> 01:33:56,467
Lost the way or escaped!

1221
01:33:56,632 --> 01:33:58,400
How can we fools escape, sir?

1222
01:33:58,566 --> 01:34:04,371
Till l find your son, ifyou ty to
escape from this house,

1223
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:06,601
l'll knock down your heads!

1224
01:34:06,766 --> 01:34:09,268
We showed someone else's photo
and told he's the man,

1225
01:34:09,432 --> 01:34:10,166
you caught us immediately,

1226
01:34:10,332 --> 01:34:13,301
if we show someone else
and say he's that man...

1227
01:34:20,466 --> 01:34:22,134
Sir, l've a small doubt.

1228
01:34:22,299 --> 01:34:25,335
lf l say he's this man's son,
what will be your reaction, sir?

1229
01:34:26,099 --> 01:34:28,501
l'll cut you both and
smear chilly powder.

1230
01:34:28,933 --> 01:34:31,201
Would you believe if l tell?

1231
01:34:31,799 --> 01:34:34,067
Whether you believe or not, this is true!

1232
01:34:34,232 --> 01:34:36,400
He's the man you're searching,
he's this man's son.

1233
01:34:36,566 --> 01:34:38,301
What son?

1234
01:34:38,466 --> 01:34:39,567
ls there ay resemblance with him?

1235
01:34:39,733 --> 01:34:40,934
Look at hi height and my height.

1236
01:34:41,099 --> 01:34:42,099
How can we be father and son?

1237
01:34:42,265 --> 01:34:43,532
Why do you talk about height?

1238
01:34:43,733 --> 01:34:45,568
Jaya Bachchan is so short,
Abhishekh is so tall!

1239
01:34:45,733 --> 01:34:46,967
Aren't they mother and son?

1240
01:34:47,165 --> 01:34:49,333
What are you talking?
- What are you talking?

1241
01:34:49,499 --> 01:34:51,400
l gave this house to him because
his house has bad omen.

1242
01:34:51,532 --> 01:34:52,633
Why are you tying to fix me?

1243
01:34:52,799 --> 01:34:53,566
Stop it!

1244
01:34:53,733 --> 01:34:56,368
No sir, he's suspecting me,
l'll show him my family photo.

1245
01:34:56,532 --> 01:34:57,900
Come.
- l'll clear your doubt.

1246
01:34:58,099 --> 01:34:58,666
Why are you pulling me?

1247
01:34:58,799 --> 01:34:59,733
Open the screen.

1248
01:35:07,866 --> 01:35:10,268
That's me, my father and my grandpa!

1249
01:35:10,566 --> 01:35:12,935
Where's your mother?
- My mother took this photo.

1250
01:35:14,866 --> 01:35:17,368
Sir, this is poster of the film 'Manam'.

1251
01:35:17,532 --> 01:35:20,368
Earlier you said we both can have a blast!

1252
01:35:20,532 --> 01:35:23,401
Now you say its Manam poster.
You...

1253
01:35:23,566 --> 01:35:25,367
Leave him, he's little frustrated.

1254
01:35:25,499 --> 01:35:26,466
He's torturing me.

1255
01:35:26,632 --> 01:35:28,133
He's useful for entertainment.
l'll take care of him.

1256
01:35:28,299 --> 01:35:29,900
Throw him inside.

1257
01:35:30,099 --> 01:35:32,267
He says throw them inside for eveything.

1258
01:35:34,032 --> 01:35:35,032
What's all this drama?

1259
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:37,167
Why did you bring them to our house?

1260
01:35:37,332 --> 01:35:40,935
Father, l and Chandrakala love each other.

1261
01:35:42,099 --> 01:35:44,267
Am l doing anything wrong, dad?

1262
01:35:44,432 --> 01:35:48,969
Loving someone is not wrong but l'm
worried if Babji comes to know this.

1263
01:35:49,132 --> 01:35:51,567
He's already angy that someone
has eloped with his other sister.

1264
01:35:51,733 --> 01:35:53,701
What if he knows it was you...

1265
01:35:53,866 --> 01:35:57,569
Before he knows about this,
l'll convince him about my love for Chandu.

1266
01:35:57,699 --> 01:36:00,835
No, my son...
- Do you like Chandrakala or not?

1267
01:36:01,899 --> 01:36:04,301
She has all the characters that
your mother has.

1268
01:36:04,466 --> 01:36:05,934
l like her so much.

1269
01:36:06,299 --> 01:36:07,066
Thanks, father.

1270
01:36:09,399 --> 01:36:10,633
l'm coming, Sippy.

1271
01:36:20,165 --> 01:36:23,001
l can't understand what your plan is!

1272
01:36:23,165 --> 01:36:24,299
l'm totally confused.

1273
01:36:24,466 --> 01:36:28,203
To make your brother understand our love,
l got you shifted to my house.

1274
01:36:28,733 --> 01:36:30,334
Your brother is seeking revenge,

1275
01:36:30,466 --> 01:36:32,701
l'll make him accept our love
whole heartedly.

1276
01:36:33,132 --> 01:36:34,900
You came here to stay for 10 days,

1277
01:36:35,366 --> 01:36:37,267
l'll ensure you become
permanent resident here.

1278
01:36:37,833 --> 01:36:38,600
Okay?

1279
01:36:39,165 --> 01:36:42,268
Venky, tap has gone dy in
brother's bathroom, check it.

1280
01:36:51,099 --> 01:36:56,003
O my love...my love...

1281
01:37:11,666 --> 01:37:16,437
Look...look....look at me!

1282
01:37:16,599 --> 01:37:18,801
Wearing the goggles of love...

1283
01:37:18,966 --> 01:37:21,535
Look at the lover in me...

1284
01:37:21,699 --> 01:37:26,503
O maiden, flower like maiden...

1285
01:37:26,666 --> 01:37:30,870
See yourself in me...

1286
01:37:31,032 --> 01:37:36,537
O maiden, you're my breathe...

1287
01:37:36,699 --> 01:37:40,736
l'm dreaming as your lover boy...

1288
01:37:40,966 --> 01:37:45,804
Say no to light,
requested Sun to go away...

1289
01:37:45,966 --> 01:37:50,837
When l'm with you,
why do you need moonlight?

1290
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:55,371
O my love...my love...

1291
01:37:55,632 --> 01:38:01,170
Come and rest on my heart
like a butte_ly, O my dear...

1292
01:38:16,199 --> 01:38:21,003
At the dusk,
on my tender and thin waist...

1293
01:38:21,165 --> 01:38:25,202
l'm waiting eagerly for the day
your hands caresses it...

1294
01:38:25,366 --> 01:38:30,137
O girl, l'm also in the same boat...

1295
01:38:30,299 --> 01:38:35,771
l'm saving all my energy for that day...

1296
01:38:35,933 --> 01:38:40,637
Shall l become gesture of eye?
Shall l come as your hug?

1297
01:38:40,799 --> 01:38:44,469
Would l say no ifyou offer it as gift?

1298
01:39:15,432 --> 01:39:20,236
l'm yours and partner for the life...

1299
01:39:20,399 --> 01:39:23,969
l'll always be with you and yours...

1300
01:39:24,733 --> 01:39:34,843
O dear, l'm the lines on your palm,
l'll never leave you all the life...

1301
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:40,004
l want you to bring palanquin
and celebrate the festival...

1302
01:39:40,165 --> 01:39:43,635
l'll fulfill your wish...

1303
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,470
Priest, we're residing in a house
that fits your building rules.

1304
01:40:19,632 --> 01:40:21,633
Would eveything happen as l wish?

1305
01:40:21,966 --> 01:40:27,571
Tree gives oygen in day time,
the same tree give carbondioxide at night.

1306
01:40:27,733 --> 01:40:31,736
So, there won't be any difference
between good house and bad house.

1307
01:40:31,933 --> 01:40:33,601
Why are you standing here
with big tummy?

1308
01:40:33,766 --> 01:40:34,733
Go, stand there.

1309
01:40:34,899 --> 01:40:36,433
What's his problem?
Why is he after me?

1310
01:40:36,599 --> 01:40:39,001
lf we stay in this house,
my sister will get married, right?

1311
01:40:39,165 --> 01:40:41,333
lf she marries,
she'll stay in this house only.

1312
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,435
l mean she must stay in this
house to get married.

1313
01:40:44,599 --> 01:40:46,434
Why do you wory so much?

1314
01:40:46,599 --> 01:40:49,601
Bride is here, groom is here.

1315
01:40:49,833 --> 01:40:50,433
He?

1316
01:40:50,599 --> 01:40:53,301
Shasty, l'm not the groom.
He's the bridegroom.

1317
01:40:55,966 --> 01:40:56,700
Yes.

1318
01:40:57,666 --> 01:40:59,968
You've a sister like a heroine,

1319
01:41:00,165 --> 01:41:02,667
are you marying her to a character
actor like than leaving the hero?

1320
01:41:03,733 --> 01:41:04,600
Character actor?

1321
01:41:05,466 --> 01:41:08,435
lf she was my sister,
l would mary her to this young hero.

1322
01:41:08,599 --> 01:41:10,400
His face is pe_ect!

1323
01:41:16,165 --> 01:41:18,433
Shasty, mind your work.

1324
01:41:18,766 --> 01:41:21,335
Fix a an auspicious time for
my sister's engagement.

1325
01:41:24,632 --> 01:41:26,767
There's an auspicious time
on coming 9th.

1326
01:41:26,933 --> 01:41:29,101
You can fix engagement on that day.

1327
01:41:29,265 --> 01:41:30,165
Okay, sir.

1328
01:41:35,699 --> 01:41:36,699
l'm there with you!

1329
01:41:38,265 --> 01:41:40,900
l'm also here,
l'll see how can you man mary her!

1330
01:41:41,199 --> 01:41:45,670
Brother, l've information that Kesava Reddy
is planning another attack on us.

1331
01:41:45,833 --> 01:41:48,268
We must be vey careful till
this marriage is over.

1332
01:41:48,933 --> 01:41:51,602
One who fears can't live!

1333
01:41:52,332 --> 01:41:54,000
One who wants to live won't fear!

1334
01:41:54,165 --> 01:41:56,400
Sir, neither you've fear nor brain.

1335
01:41:56,566 --> 01:41:57,867
What the hell are you blabbering?
- If not what else sir?

1336
01:41:58,065 --> 01:42:00,233
Would anyone go to mutton shop
with a goat in house?

1337
01:42:00,399 --> 01:42:02,968
Why are you beating around the bush?
Come to the point straight.

1338
01:42:03,165 --> 01:42:06,801
Meka Papa Rao's family is
like DDLJ family.

1339
01:42:07,065 --> 01:42:08,699
He's vey emotional about his family.

1340
01:42:08,866 --> 01:42:12,069
So ifwe get his wife and
hit her before him,

1341
01:42:12,232 --> 01:42:14,734
truth will come out and
l'll go out, sir.

1342
01:42:17,032 --> 01:42:20,235
Bloody Sippy! Are you fixing my mother?

1343
01:42:20,399 --> 01:42:21,399
Good idea.

1344
01:42:22,466 --> 01:42:26,436
Go, get his wife and
also Sippy's wife too.

1345
01:42:28,733 --> 01:42:31,068
lf he refuses, at least Sippy will sing!

1346
01:42:34,099 --> 01:42:35,366
l'm not yet married, sir.

1347
01:42:35,532 --> 01:42:40,536
Find a good girl for me and
fix my marriage.

1348
01:42:40,666 --> 01:42:42,501
l don't have any caste feeling.

1349
01:42:42,699 --> 01:42:43,800
l'll see, go.

1350
01:42:45,666 --> 01:42:46,366
Brother!

1351
01:42:46,532 --> 01:42:48,700
Bring Papa Rao's wife
wherever she may be!

1352
01:42:48,866 --> 01:42:49,499
Okay, brother.

1353
01:43:13,199 --> 01:43:15,167
She's so beautiful!
Is she Sippy's daughter?

1354
01:43:15,332 --> 01:43:16,499
His wife!

1355
01:43:16,833 --> 01:43:17,733
Wife?

1356
01:43:18,399 --> 01:43:19,399
Wake him up!

1357
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,101
Get up!

1358
01:43:24,432 --> 01:43:27,568
She's slim like cobra!
He appears like a snake charmer.

1359
01:43:27,733 --> 01:43:29,601
How could they become a couple?

1360
01:43:29,766 --> 01:43:32,702
lf snake is young,

1361
01:43:32,866 --> 01:43:37,070
if the snake charmer plays the pipe,
whether he's young or old, it'll get charmed.

1362
01:43:37,566 --> 01:43:38,633
lt's logic!

1363
01:43:50,966 --> 01:43:53,902
What do you want?
- Can l talk to you for two minutes?

1364
01:43:56,032 --> 01:43:58,200
My name is Hamsa Sippy.
- l know.

1365
01:43:58,833 --> 01:44:01,502
l'm here to tell about your
husband Sippy getting tortured.

1366
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,334
What happened to my Sippy?

1367
01:44:04,599 --> 01:44:06,834
What should l do now?
- Just do as l say!

1368
01:44:07,099 --> 01:44:08,433
What's the news, Puppy?

1369
01:44:08,599 --> 01:44:11,668
l'm checking my fortune for this week.
- How is it?

1370
01:44:11,833 --> 01:44:15,336
lt seems my life will take a turn and
it seems l'll see beautiful new things.

1371
01:44:15,499 --> 01:44:19,035
Meet new people and
says eveything will be new!

1372
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:21,100
Do you need beautiful new things
at this age?

1373
01:44:21,265 --> 01:44:24,167
Wait for two days,
your wife will appear new to you.

1374
01:44:24,599 --> 01:44:26,334
Hubby!

1375
01:44:28,599 --> 01:44:29,666
Why my wife is here?

1376
01:44:31,666 --> 01:44:32,633
Hubby!

1377
01:44:33,432 --> 01:44:34,499
l'll call you later, cut it.

1378
01:44:38,099 --> 01:44:38,833
Hubby!

1379
01:44:50,799 --> 01:44:52,700
Hubby! How are you, dear?

1380
01:44:53,032 --> 01:44:54,867
You were tall and fat like Mohanlal,

1381
01:44:55,065 --> 01:44:57,400
why have you become short and
fat like Chandramohan?

1382
01:44:57,566 --> 01:45:00,769
Who is she?
- His wife, brother. Our men brought her.

1383
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,502
Who are you? What' this?
Who do you think l'm?

1384
01:45:10,666 --> 01:45:14,936
How well playing drama, Puppy?
- What drama, sir?

1385
01:45:15,833 --> 01:45:18,569
l know she's your wife.
- My wife?

1386
01:45:25,566 --> 01:45:29,269
l'm confused, sir.
l couldn't recognize my wife.

1387
01:45:29,432 --> 01:45:32,334
Why have you grown so thin?
Lost fairness too.

1388
01:45:32,499 --> 01:45:35,301
Leave her!
Why are you exploring her body?

1389
01:45:35,466 --> 01:45:37,301
Look at his height and age!

1390
01:45:37,466 --> 01:45:38,767
Look at her glamour and her height!

1391
01:45:38,933 --> 01:45:41,235
How can they become man and wife?
Ask him, sir.

1392
01:45:41,399 --> 01:45:44,535
l think he'll ruin my plan.
Let me enter and confuse them.

1393
01:45:44,699 --> 01:45:45,766
What's the confusion, sir?

1394
01:45:45,933 --> 01:45:48,268
What's the confusion?
She could be his third wife, right?

1395
01:45:49,032 --> 01:45:51,801
lf she's your third wife,
how could your son be tall like palm tree?

1396
01:45:52,099 --> 01:45:54,701
What's this, sir?
Sippy gets so many doubts.

1397
01:45:54,866 --> 01:45:57,101
lf you trust his words,
you'll get cheated.

1398
01:45:57,265 --> 01:45:58,332
Don't trust him.

1399
01:46:00,165 --> 01:46:02,033
May be he's first wife's son!
- Yes.

1400
01:46:02,966 --> 01:46:06,502
Yes, he's firs wife's son.
But l take care of him as my son.

1401
01:46:06,666 --> 01:46:09,268
Tell me, where he is?
- l'll not tell.

1402
01:46:09,432 --> 01:46:11,934
l'll find my sister if l know
his whereabouts.

1403
01:46:12,099 --> 01:46:13,834
Where is he?
- l'll not tell.

1404
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,501
Tell me.

1405
01:46:15,766 --> 01:46:17,834
Sir, please don't hit, she may die.

1406
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,769
You told me if l hit his wife,
she'll tell the truth.

1407
01:46:20,933 --> 01:46:22,467
Wife is wife to anyone, sir.

1408
01:46:22,632 --> 01:46:23,332
Shut up!

1409
01:46:26,132 --> 01:46:28,634
l know the entire script,
Iet them hit me, l'll not tell the truth.

1410
01:46:28,799 --> 01:46:30,167
You don't wory.

1411
01:46:33,966 --> 01:46:35,901
Tell me.
- l'll not tell.

1412
01:46:36,299 --> 01:46:36,799
Will you tell or not?

1413
01:46:36,966 --> 01:46:41,403
lt's not right to hit women,
why not talk to her?

1414
01:46:43,366 --> 01:46:44,166
Brother!

1415
01:46:44,332 --> 01:46:46,500
l'm giving them 2 hour time.

1416
01:46:46,666 --> 01:46:49,935
Tell them to discuss in room and
tell me where their son is!

1417
01:46:50,432 --> 01:46:51,766
Why in the same room, sir?

1418
01:46:51,933 --> 01:46:54,402
They'll think if both are in
different rooms.

1419
01:46:55,232 --> 01:46:57,968
Why do you get tensed like her husband?

1420
01:46:59,532 --> 01:47:03,669
She'll stay here till l know about
his whereabouts.

1421
01:47:03,833 --> 01:47:04,800
Take her away.

1422
01:47:05,699 --> 01:47:07,333
Come...come...

1423
01:47:09,666 --> 01:47:11,567
ls this also your plan?
- Any doubt?

1424
01:47:11,733 --> 01:47:14,168
How did you know about my wife?

1425
01:47:14,332 --> 01:47:15,866
Eveyone has his own CD!

1426
01:47:16,733 --> 01:47:19,735
You're waking the sleeping beast in me.

1427
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,268
A cat can't do anything if it is wake!

1428
01:47:22,432 --> 01:47:25,835
Sippy, Puppy's wife is ravishing.

1429
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,202
From behind, like county chicken...

1430
01:47:28,366 --> 01:47:29,967
Didn't you see her from top?

1431
01:47:30,165 --> 01:47:30,698
She's sey!

1432
01:47:30,866 --> 01:47:34,402
You mustn't talk bad about other's wife.

1433
01:47:34,566 --> 01:47:36,401
Why do you get angy as
if she's your wife?

1434
01:47:36,566 --> 01:47:39,101
Wife is wife to anyone.
- That's what l said.

1435
01:47:41,833 --> 01:47:43,401
lt's been many days since
we met like this.

1436
01:47:44,532 --> 01:47:47,101
What if anyone sees us?
-Let them see, why should we be scared?

1437
01:47:47,332 --> 01:47:50,268
How long can we meet stealthily like this?
Let's tell them today, come.

1438
01:47:51,532 --> 01:47:53,066
Venky, no...please listen to me.
- Why are you so scared?

1439
01:47:53,232 --> 01:47:54,166
My brother will kill you if he sees us.

1440
01:47:54,332 --> 01:47:55,833
Close your eyes,
l'm there with you, right?

1441
01:47:58,666 --> 01:47:59,666
Open your eyes and see!

1442
01:48:00,165 --> 01:48:00,999
See!

1443
01:48:14,165 --> 01:48:16,333
Don't you want to live anymore?

1444
01:48:16,499 --> 01:48:18,767
Why are you romancing her in home?
What would happen if anyone see it?

1445
01:48:18,899 --> 01:48:20,200
Who will see us?
- Won't anyone see you?

1446
01:48:20,366 --> 01:48:21,366
No one will see us.
- Why?

1447
01:48:21,532 --> 01:48:22,833
All have shut their eyes.

1448
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,670
Open your eyes.
Bharath, you must do it now!

1449
01:48:28,933 --> 01:48:31,702
Venky told me not to remove the cucumber
even if there's an earth quake.

1450
01:48:31,866 --> 01:48:34,401
lf you remove the cucumber,
you'll experience earth quake.

1451
01:48:34,566 --> 01:48:36,334
l must be handsome for
evening engagement, right?

1452
01:48:36,499 --> 01:48:37,967
Engagement must be there, right?

1453
01:48:38,132 --> 01:48:39,967
lf you open your eyes,
you'll die with heart attack.

1454
01:48:40,165 --> 01:48:42,800
Why are you saying that, short man?

1455
01:48:43,132 --> 01:48:45,334
Shall l keep cucumber
to you also, Sippy?

1456
01:48:45,466 --> 01:48:47,801
You can't cheat me with cucumbers.

1457
01:48:47,966 --> 01:48:50,335
Hubby! Where are you?

1458
01:48:58,766 --> 01:49:05,005
Amalapuram is that side...
Peddapuram is this side...

1459
01:49:05,833 --> 01:49:08,835
Godavari is running in between...

1460
01:49:09,966 --> 01:49:13,402
River is swirling to cross it...

1461
01:49:13,566 --> 01:49:16,969
There's the catch...

1462
01:49:17,199 --> 01:49:19,601
ls the sweet for me, dear?
- No, for my husband.

1463
01:49:20,165 --> 01:49:21,099
Your husband?

1464
01:49:27,499 --> 01:49:35,206
lf God grants me a boon...
l'll wish for you only...

1465
01:49:38,599 --> 01:49:42,002
Even in sleep...

1466
01:49:44,366 --> 01:49:45,467
Vey nice!

1467
01:49:47,833 --> 01:49:50,569
You close eyes with cucumbers.
Close it.

1468
01:49:51,866 --> 01:49:54,435
Chandu, please listen to me.
What happened now?

1469
01:49:54,899 --> 01:49:55,899
No, please listen to me.

1470
01:50:05,099 --> 01:50:05,933
What's this?

1471
01:50:06,399 --> 01:50:11,737
Evening she's getting engaged,
they're getting facials done and she's refusing.

1472
01:50:12,966 --> 01:50:15,168
May be she doesn't like this marriage.

1473
01:50:21,966 --> 01:50:25,803
Whether she gets her facials done or not,
this marriage will go on as decided.

1474
01:50:26,432 --> 01:50:27,166
You come with me.

1475
01:50:33,165 --> 01:50:38,870
Did you see they locked us in room
fearing we may escape during function?

1476
01:50:51,499 --> 01:50:55,269
Greetings, drank breaMast.
Ate coffee!

1477
01:50:55,432 --> 01:50:58,635
Why so much of fun?
Who is the groom? You or that man?

1478
01:50:58,799 --> 01:51:00,400
Evey man has his own ring!

1479
01:51:02,899 --> 01:51:06,902
Hamsa! Venky wants you in the back room.

1480
01:51:07,632 --> 01:51:08,432
Venky?

1481
01:51:08,599 --> 01:51:12,069
Venky went that side,
why are you calling her this side?

1482
01:51:12,232 --> 01:51:13,499
l know that, Sippy.

1483
01:51:13,666 --> 01:51:16,168
As soon as she enters the room,
l'll switch off the light,

1484
01:51:16,332 --> 01:51:18,600
l'll hug her tightly and kiss her suddenly.

1485
01:51:20,299 --> 01:51:23,001
Why do get so angy?
- He says he'll kiss your wife.

1486
01:51:23,165 --> 01:51:25,433
Only if she's my wife,
l told you my son arranged her.

1487
01:51:25,599 --> 01:51:28,568
Sir, you don't a thing.

1488
01:51:30,466 --> 01:51:31,700
She's my wife!

1489
01:51:43,699 --> 01:51:46,435
Auspicious time has come,
please exchange the rings.

1490
01:51:47,366 --> 01:51:48,266
Take it, dear.

1491
01:51:53,866 --> 01:51:54,633
Brother!

1492
01:52:09,299 --> 01:52:13,436
Stop!
- Brother!

1493
01:52:13,866 --> 01:52:15,267
What's this? Who is she?

1494
01:52:16,232 --> 01:52:19,101
l raised her for 20 years vey fondly,

1495
01:52:20,866 --> 01:52:25,170
she ran away from marriage
and married her lover, my sister.

1496
01:52:25,332 --> 01:52:27,767
l didn't mary him, brother.
- Why did you go ten?

1497
01:52:27,933 --> 01:52:29,401
Stop, sir.

1498
01:52:29,666 --> 01:52:32,402
She made a mistake by running
away from marriage.

1499
01:52:32,566 --> 01:52:34,200
She realized her mistake and
has come back, right?

1500
01:52:34,332 --> 01:52:35,566
Please forgive me, brother.

1501
01:52:35,733 --> 01:52:41,438
l'll forgive you but tell me how your lover
is better than the groom of my choice?

1502
01:52:42,299 --> 01:52:43,333
l'll forgive you.

1503
01:52:44,733 --> 01:52:45,600
Ask her to tell.

1504
01:52:46,099 --> 01:52:48,601
lt's not she who has to tell.
We!

1505
01:52:50,232 --> 01:52:52,667
We raise girls for 20 years,

1506
01:52:53,065 --> 01:52:57,002
she readily agrees to go to the
home we select for her,

1507
01:52:57,466 --> 01:52:58,433
do you know why?

1508
01:52:59,566 --> 01:53:01,267
Because when she turns back to look,

1509
01:53:01,833 --> 01:53:06,237
she'll find a brother like you to console
and hug her with affection.

1510
01:53:09,599 --> 01:53:12,969
Your anger or her tears aren't
the solution to this problem.

1511
01:53:13,199 --> 01:53:14,500
Just think for once!

1512
01:53:15,766 --> 01:53:18,635
A girl has come back with tears
seeking forgiveness,

1513
01:53:19,165 --> 01:53:22,835
ls it right to throw her out?

1514
01:53:24,099 --> 01:53:26,501
Brother isn't just one who
allows sister to tie rakhi

1515
01:53:27,099 --> 01:53:30,669
he's the man who takes care of sister
if she comes home with problems.

1516
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:38,269
Brother, no need of fight in public.

1517
01:53:38,432 --> 01:53:41,334
Sister has come back,
Bharath too is here.

1518
01:53:43,632 --> 01:53:47,435
Auspicious time is elapsing,
if you come, we can finish the function.

1519
01:53:55,699 --> 01:53:58,268
Priest, cancel this engagement.

1520
01:54:14,632 --> 01:54:17,735
Look, she went against me.

1521
01:54:18,299 --> 01:54:19,900
Now she has come back refusing
to mary him.

1522
01:54:21,065 --> 01:54:28,272
lf she had married the man l selected,
she wouldn't be sad now.

1523
01:54:31,966 --> 01:54:34,268
Okay, let bygones be bygones.

1524
01:54:34,432 --> 01:54:36,333
l'll talk to Bharath and fix their marriage.

1525
01:54:38,699 --> 01:54:40,667
You give company to sister, go.

1526
01:54:43,833 --> 01:54:44,466
Sister!

1527
01:54:47,566 --> 01:54:48,733
What's this, sister?

1528
01:54:48,933 --> 01:54:53,504
You refused to mary brother's choice,
you ran away to mary your lover,

1529
01:54:53,632 --> 01:54:56,668
why did you come back
without marying him?

1530
01:54:58,699 --> 01:55:00,867
Why are you laughing now?

1531
01:55:02,065 --> 01:55:04,434
Who said l didn't mary?

1532
01:55:13,833 --> 01:55:16,969
lf you've to get married,
he told me l should say l didn't mary.

1533
01:55:17,132 --> 01:55:19,601
Told you? Who?
- Me!

1534
01:55:23,432 --> 01:55:24,466
You?

1535
01:55:24,666 --> 01:55:27,502
Knowingly or unknowingly l separated
her from your brother.

1536
01:55:27,632 --> 01:55:29,600
That's why l decided to bring
them closer again.

1537
01:55:29,733 --> 01:55:32,535
Why did you tell to lie about marriage?

1538
01:55:33,799 --> 01:55:38,503
lf any student comes home after failing
in exam, eveyone will scold him, right?

1539
01:55:38,833 --> 01:55:44,305
lf he comes home cying that he failed
in exam, they'll console him affectionately.

1540
01:55:46,165 --> 01:55:49,434
l used that sympathy angle to bring
brother and sister closer.

1541
01:55:51,132 --> 01:55:54,235
He was mischievous since childhood
but never hurt anyone.

1542
01:55:54,399 --> 01:55:57,101
Did you see how my father
is supporting our love?

1543
01:55:58,532 --> 01:56:02,602
There's no kick in jobs without money
and marriages without love.

1544
01:56:03,466 --> 01:56:04,733
Thanks, father.

1545
01:56:04,899 --> 01:56:08,068
That short man is overhearing us,
Iet's go and give him a jerk!

1546
01:56:11,733 --> 01:56:14,235
Did you hear eveything?
- What an acting!

1547
01:56:14,399 --> 01:56:15,800
What did l do?
- What did you do?

1548
01:56:15,966 --> 01:56:18,501
Why keep that face as an
example of honesty?

1549
01:56:19,032 --> 01:56:22,168
You both played drama and
involved those ladies too.

1550
01:56:22,332 --> 01:56:25,201
Why should we fight among ourselves?
Why don't you join us?

1551
01:56:25,366 --> 01:56:27,468
ls it holy Ganges river to ioin?

1552
01:56:27,632 --> 01:56:32,903
They're discussing downstairs to get Babji's
elder sister married to Bharath.

1553
01:56:33,099 --> 01:56:34,967
You can't stop this marriage.

1554
01:56:35,699 --> 01:56:37,367
Son!
- Father!

1555
01:56:37,532 --> 01:56:38,499
Who is it?

1556
01:56:38,666 --> 01:56:40,334
Son!
- Mother!

1557
01:56:40,499 --> 01:56:43,435
Son!
- Mother!

1558
01:56:43,599 --> 01:56:44,733
Stop it!

1559
01:56:45,632 --> 01:56:47,400
You've met, right?
Why are you still shouting?

1560
01:56:47,599 --> 01:56:49,367
lt's been years since l saw you, mother!

1561
01:56:49,532 --> 01:56:50,499
How many years?

1562
01:56:50,666 --> 01:56:52,034
l saw my mother when she was little girl.

1563
01:56:52,199 --> 01:56:53,600
How can you see her when
she was a little girl?

1564
01:56:53,766 --> 01:56:55,267
l saw her in photo.

1565
01:56:55,733 --> 01:56:57,501
ln photo?
l didn't get you.

1566
01:56:57,632 --> 01:56:58,733
My mother understood it.

1567
01:56:58,899 --> 01:57:01,735
Who is he?
- He's Sippy, my colleague.

1568
01:57:03,332 --> 01:57:04,366
You are...

1569
01:57:05,766 --> 01:57:07,567
Hubby!
- Honey!

1570
01:57:07,966 --> 01:57:08,800
Please have your tea.

1571
01:57:08,966 --> 01:57:09,633
What's this?

1572
01:57:09,733 --> 01:57:13,903
Why did you come late?
- Got late last night.

1573
01:57:15,699 --> 01:57:16,599
How?

1574
01:57:17,265 --> 01:57:18,966
How?
- How?

1575
01:57:20,532 --> 01:57:21,332
Who is she?

1576
01:57:21,499 --> 01:57:22,433
My mother.

1577
01:57:22,733 --> 01:57:24,501
Who is she?
- His wife.

1578
01:57:25,699 --> 01:57:27,834
Stop...stop there.

1579
01:57:28,399 --> 01:57:34,972
lf she's his wife,
why did he call her as honey?

1580
01:57:35,299 --> 01:57:35,966
Yes.

1581
01:57:36,366 --> 01:57:37,533
Will get into soup if l don't control him.

1582
01:57:37,699 --> 01:57:40,435
l'll hit you! Do you think you asked
an intelligent question?

1583
01:57:40,566 --> 01:57:42,501
He called her not this lady.

1584
01:57:42,799 --> 01:57:43,733
But he tried to go to her.

1585
01:57:43,899 --> 01:57:45,734
Changed the direction,
did you go blind?

1586
01:57:45,866 --> 01:57:46,900
You're right.

1587
01:57:47,499 --> 01:57:49,834
Who is he to say you're right?

1588
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,434
Venky, ty to recognize him!

1589
01:57:55,299 --> 01:58:03,607
This is the song of happiness of yore days...

1590
01:58:03,733 --> 01:58:11,407
This is the same spring that
blooms in our eyes...

1591
01:58:11,532 --> 01:58:12,165
Brother!

1592
01:58:12,332 --> 01:58:13,366
Stop it!

1593
01:58:14,165 --> 01:58:16,667
ls it house or stage to act?
Is he your brother?

1594
01:58:16,799 --> 01:58:18,500
He's my brother,
he ran away from home as kid,

1595
01:58:18,666 --> 01:58:19,600
my mother too ran away to get him.

1596
01:58:19,766 --> 01:58:20,766
Did you mother ran away?

1597
01:58:20,899 --> 01:58:22,533
Your step mother should've
gone for him, right?

1598
01:58:22,699 --> 01:58:23,733
My step mother went for my mother.

1599
01:58:23,899 --> 01:58:25,934
Why didn't you step mother turn up?
- My mother has come, right?

1600
01:58:27,366 --> 01:58:29,601
l'm little confused.
l didn't get you.

1601
01:58:29,766 --> 01:58:32,535
l don't care if you can't understand,
all others have understood it.

1602
01:58:38,332 --> 01:58:40,167
What happened, Venky?
- You wait, man!

1603
01:58:42,699 --> 01:58:43,800
Who are they?

1604
01:58:43,966 --> 01:58:46,335
My mother.
- Greetings, son-in-law!

1605
01:58:50,065 --> 01:58:52,400
My mother makes relationship
with eveyone easily.

1606
01:58:52,566 --> 01:58:53,833
They're Babii's sisters, mother.

1607
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,267
Greetings, aunty.

1608
01:58:58,065 --> 01:59:00,100
They are also like you,
they too are vey friendly.

1609
01:59:00,265 --> 01:59:01,165
They'll stay here till marriage.

1610
01:59:01,332 --> 01:59:03,333
Even after marriage they'll stay
here only, right?

1611
01:59:06,332 --> 01:59:09,735
lt means all are relatives,
it's same wherever they may be!

1612
01:59:11,265 --> 01:59:14,601
Thank you so much for considering
my sisters as your daughters.

1613
01:59:15,265 --> 01:59:17,333
Please take her inside.
Bye, madam.

1614
01:59:26,733 --> 01:59:29,602
What?
- l've two doubts.

1615
01:59:31,165 --> 01:59:33,100
You used bad word for me, right?

1616
01:59:33,265 --> 01:59:34,099
Any doubt?

1617
01:59:35,532 --> 01:59:38,568
Did Babji go after understanding
this or not?

1618
01:59:38,733 --> 01:59:39,733
Shall l ask him?

1619
01:59:39,899 --> 01:59:41,333
No...no...

1620
01:59:41,499 --> 01:59:43,534
Puppy? Why are you calling him?

1621
01:59:49,065 --> 01:59:53,969
Brother, Babji's sister who eloped
has come back to home.

1622
02:00:03,733 --> 02:00:05,334
Eveything will go on fine.

1623
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,002
l'm tensed about what would happen
at any time, aunty!

1624
02:00:10,165 --> 02:00:12,333
Venky is taking too much
risk for us, aunty.

1625
02:00:12,499 --> 02:00:16,336
My son is vey intelligent.
Nobody can catch him.

1626
02:00:21,966 --> 02:00:24,368
Greetings, Sathya!
Why did you get late, brother?

1627
02:00:24,599 --> 02:00:26,968
l must show this to Babji and
get a gift from him also.

1628
02:00:32,366 --> 02:00:34,701
How are you, dear?
- Brother.

1629
02:00:34,866 --> 02:00:37,001
Please come, sit here.

1630
02:00:37,165 --> 02:00:38,065
How are you?

1631
02:00:40,632 --> 02:00:42,367
Bharathi, l reached safely.

1632
02:00:42,532 --> 02:00:45,935
Don't have curd rice because
l'm not there, have dum biyani, bye.

1633
02:00:46,099 --> 02:00:47,900
Are you from Hyderabad?

1634
02:00:48,065 --> 02:00:49,933
Who are you?
- My name is Sippy.

1635
02:00:50,065 --> 02:00:51,800
l'm a parrot locked in a cage.

1636
02:00:51,966 --> 02:00:53,434
You look carrot, are you a parrot?

1637
02:00:53,599 --> 02:00:56,068
What timing!

1638
02:00:56,632 --> 02:00:59,634
One comes with sweets to a marriage house,
why did you come with a pot?

1639
02:00:59,966 --> 02:01:01,767
You're mistaken if you think it as pot,
it's ashes.

1640
02:01:01,933 --> 02:01:05,836
Babji's father's ashes?
- No, Ammulu's lover's.

1641
02:01:06,566 --> 02:01:09,635
Why is it smelling like ponds powder?
- He was using ponds powder.

1642
02:01:11,733 --> 02:01:14,102
Ammulu means Babji's sister, right?
-Yes.

1643
02:01:14,265 --> 02:01:16,300
You killed him, right?
- Yes.

1644
02:01:17,332 --> 02:01:19,534
Was it him you had killed?
- Yes, l killed him.

1645
02:01:22,165 --> 02:01:23,266
Keep it there!

1646
02:01:24,899 --> 02:01:26,300
Why is he in this house?

1647
02:01:26,466 --> 02:01:29,836
He's not in your house,
you're in his house.

1648
02:01:30,032 --> 02:01:31,500
lf l tell Babii won't believe it.

1649
02:01:31,666 --> 02:01:34,902
You're his man, if you tell him,
he'll believe you.

1650
02:01:35,466 --> 02:01:36,800
Vey difficult.
- Why?

1651
02:01:36,966 --> 02:01:39,168
l've already committed myself
saying l've killed him.

1652
02:01:39,332 --> 02:01:42,101
Sathya gave me this gold chain as gift.

1653
02:01:42,265 --> 02:01:44,100
lf l say now that l didn't kill him.
- Would it take back the gold chain?

1654
02:01:44,232 --> 02:01:45,933
He'll cut my head.

1655
02:01:46,599 --> 02:01:47,733
This house is vey nice.

1656
02:01:47,899 --> 02:01:49,767
She returned home after we came
to this house.

1657
02:01:49,933 --> 02:01:52,435
She's going to get married to Bharath again.

1658
02:01:54,766 --> 02:01:56,934
Eveything happened after coming
to this house.

1659
02:01:57,232 --> 02:01:58,566
By the way whose house this is?

1660
02:01:58,733 --> 02:02:01,702
Belongs to Venky, vey good boy.
Wait, l'll introduce him to you.

1661
02:02:01,866 --> 02:02:03,400
Call Venky.

1662
02:02:05,466 --> 02:02:06,934
Don't know where Venky is!

1663
02:02:07,966 --> 02:02:10,501
How to take out Sathya before
Venky walks in?

1664
02:02:18,499 --> 02:02:20,500
What hello, you dirty rascal?

1665
02:02:23,265 --> 02:02:26,501
l'm old city Dass,
l'm right before your house.

1666
02:02:26,632 --> 02:02:29,167
Where are you hiding man?

1667
02:02:30,065 --> 02:02:31,566
Stay there, l'm coming now.

1668
02:02:31,733 --> 02:02:36,471
lf you don't come by evening,
l'll raze down your Chandrakala complex.

1669
02:02:36,632 --> 02:02:38,700
l'll kill you.
- Cut it.

1670
02:02:45,766 --> 02:02:47,367
What's the tension, Sathya?

1671
02:02:47,532 --> 02:02:49,267
Urgent work, l'll be back in 2 days.

1672
02:02:49,432 --> 02:02:51,500
You said you'll stay till marriage.

1673
02:02:51,966 --> 02:02:53,667
Serious matter?
Sit here, let's talk it out.

1674
02:02:53,833 --> 02:02:55,167
You continue brother, l'll go.

1675
02:02:59,000 --> 02:02:59,600
Where are you going, brother?

1676
02:02:59,766 --> 02:03:02,168
That old city Dass.
- Dass?

1677
02:03:02,366 --> 02:03:04,134
He was acting smart on phone.

1678
02:03:04,599 --> 02:03:06,334
We mustn't spare Dass.

1679
02:03:06,566 --> 02:03:08,467
l'll not sleep till l kill him.

1680
02:03:08,799 --> 02:03:10,267
l'll sleep happily.

1681
02:03:13,199 --> 02:03:15,734
Come, Dass must die in your
hands today!

1682
02:03:16,165 --> 02:03:17,499
Get in, brother...get in.

1683
02:03:17,666 --> 02:03:18,967
Sit down...sit down, brother.

1684
02:03:19,165 --> 02:03:21,267
Driver, go...go... Go!

1685
02:03:31,499 --> 02:03:33,067
Aren't you ashamed to do like this?

1686
02:03:34,366 --> 02:03:36,067
You brought dishonour to me.

1687
02:03:36,532 --> 02:03:38,734
You made me hang my head in shame.

1688
02:03:38,899 --> 02:03:40,100
What are you thinking?

1689
02:03:41,899 --> 02:03:44,101
They're discussing inside about you,
what are you doing here?

1690
02:03:44,265 --> 02:03:45,399
About me?

1691
02:03:45,532 --> 02:03:47,166
Come.
- You go, l'll follow.

1692
02:03:47,332 --> 02:03:48,533
Don't talk!

1693
02:03:49,199 --> 02:03:51,200
Why are you getting so angy?

1694
02:03:51,632 --> 02:03:53,767
What else can l do other than get angy?

1695
02:03:54,566 --> 02:03:56,768
She has become pregnant without marriage.

1696
02:03:58,366 --> 02:04:02,837
Let's keep secret about sister's pregnancy
with Bharath and complete the marriage.

1697
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:07,337
Brother-in-law! What's this?
Will you cheat me like this?

1698
02:04:07,599 --> 02:04:09,167
Sister is not married, right?

1699
02:04:09,332 --> 02:04:12,702
What's the use of locking the door
after the house has been looted?

1700
02:04:12,866 --> 02:04:14,234
l'm refusing to mary her.

1701
02:04:19,332 --> 02:04:21,400
Where are you going?
- l'll die!

1702
02:04:21,566 --> 02:04:23,634
Listen to me, l'll fix your marriage.

1703
02:04:23,833 --> 02:04:25,201
How will you do it?
How will you do it?

1704
02:04:25,366 --> 02:04:26,734
l will do it, sir.

1705
02:04:28,332 --> 02:04:29,433
Look there!

1706
02:04:34,132 --> 02:04:34,999
Brother!

1707
02:04:40,766 --> 02:04:42,501
My brother is an idealist.

1708
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,601
He respects women so much.

1709
02:04:45,132 --> 02:04:46,566
He loves me so much.

1710
02:04:47,432 --> 02:04:50,701
As your elder brother l'm asking you,
will you mary her?

1711
02:04:51,499 --> 02:04:53,367
lf you ask l'll give my life also, brother.

1712
02:04:58,099 --> 02:05:00,067
Do you like to mary my brother?

1713
02:05:01,499 --> 02:05:04,268
lf my brother likes, it's okay to me.

1714
02:05:08,666 --> 02:05:11,101
Boy and girl have said okay,
what do you say, sir?

1715
02:05:14,833 --> 02:05:17,468
How am l to call guests to this marriage?

1716
02:05:21,733 --> 02:05:22,567
l've an idea, sir.

1717
02:05:23,499 --> 02:05:25,901
Let's tell them your sister's lover
is my brother.

1718
02:05:28,399 --> 02:05:32,069
Let's tell them you approved their love
and getting them married.

1719
02:05:33,366 --> 02:05:36,836
lf you want l'll tell eveyone that l kidnapped
your sister to unite her with my brother.

1720
02:05:38,833 --> 02:05:41,769
What's this, sir?
Can't l do this much for you, sir?

1721
02:05:41,933 --> 02:05:46,370
Brother, Venky's plan is pe_ect.

1722
02:05:49,799 --> 02:05:53,969
Yes, let's tell eveyone this stoy.

1723
02:05:55,766 --> 02:05:56,633
First tell him, sir.

1724
02:05:56,799 --> 02:05:57,799
Sippy, come here.

1725
02:06:00,866 --> 02:06:01,633
What, sir?

1726
02:06:01,799 --> 02:06:03,800
Do you know who my sister loved?
- Who?

1727
02:06:03,966 --> 02:06:05,167
This boy!

1728
02:06:06,132 --> 02:06:08,167
Do you know who kidnapped
my sister from marriage?

1729
02:06:08,332 --> 02:06:09,599
Who did it, sir?
- t was Venky!

1730
02:06:09,866 --> 02:06:13,169
Yes, this is what had happened, sir!

1731
02:06:13,332 --> 02:06:15,500
Tell the same stoy to anyone
who asks you.

1732
02:06:15,766 --> 02:06:16,600
Stoy?

1733
02:06:18,933 --> 02:06:20,100
What stoy, sir?

1734
02:06:20,432 --> 02:06:21,666
What's this confusion?

1735
02:06:21,833 --> 02:06:22,934
Venky, take him away.

1736
02:06:23,165 --> 02:06:25,133
Why do you call the truth as stoy?

1737
02:06:25,265 --> 02:06:26,065
Come, Sippy.

1738
02:06:27,165 --> 02:06:27,465
What's going on here?

1739
02:06:27,632 --> 02:06:32,970
l played drama that his eloped sister is
pregnant and fixed her marriage with Anand.

1740
02:06:33,165 --> 02:06:34,366
They're already married, right?

1741
02:06:34,532 --> 02:06:36,500
We know but Babii doesn't know that.

1742
02:06:37,899 --> 02:06:41,469
Not just in head,
your entire body is brain!

1743
02:06:41,632 --> 02:06:43,367
lt's God's boon!

1744
02:06:44,532 --> 02:06:46,400
Sippy too has agreed.

1745
02:06:46,566 --> 02:06:50,202
Since all the problems are solved,
Sippy will throw a dance party for us.

1746
02:06:50,366 --> 02:06:51,433
Okay, Sippy?

1747
02:07:14,933 --> 02:07:20,438
Silly street boys are after me...

1748
02:07:20,599 --> 02:07:26,171
They whistled, danced
and troubled me...

1749
02:07:26,332 --> 02:07:31,804
J
l was in black and white sari
they surrounded me...

1750
02:07:31,966 --> 02:07:37,805
They sprinkled colours and
Ieft me breathless...

1751
02:07:37,966 --> 02:07:42,970
Trust me, l never enioyed it any day...

1752
02:07:44,099 --> 02:07:48,870
Evey boy iust raised my tension...

1753
02:07:49,833 --> 02:07:52,502
Chanti...Bunty...Kittu....Bittu...

1754
02:07:52,666 --> 02:07:56,736
So many came after me
but l didn't like anyone...

1755
02:07:57,532 --> 02:07:59,533
But you are...

1756
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:04,637
Super...super...

1757
02:08:23,499 --> 02:08:26,201
You naughty girl,
your beauty is ravishing...

1758
02:08:28,632 --> 02:08:31,835
Come, let's paint the town red...

1759
02:08:47,733 --> 02:08:56,241
So many men claim
l'm elder sister of ice cream...

1760
02:08:56,399 --> 02:09:01,604
So many fans of mine claim
l'm younger sister of magnet...

1761
02:09:01,766 --> 02:09:04,835
Hey, you're sister-in-law of masala...

1762
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,535
You're daughter of hot chilly...

1763
02:09:07,699 --> 02:09:13,137
lt'll sync well and get hooked
with a link between us...

1764
02:09:42,432 --> 02:09:51,073
lf l wear ghagra choli,
people would go mad and whistle at me...

1765
02:09:51,232 --> 02:09:56,570
lf l make an enty in skin tight dress,
people would make dirty gestures...

1766
02:09:56,699 --> 02:10:02,337
When you walk before me in a midi,
my heart's headlight blew away...

1767
02:10:02,499 --> 02:10:08,338
lf you come into my bedroom
from heart and the door is latched...

1768
02:10:34,265 --> 02:10:36,834
With God's grace eveything
is happening as we thought.

1769
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:40,103
At least you mary her without
cheating her brother.

1770
02:10:40,265 --> 02:10:43,167
l'll make a plan for that.
- l say no to your plans.

1771
02:10:46,532 --> 02:10:48,467
Thank you vey much.
- Why?

1772
02:10:48,632 --> 02:10:51,401
Since we entered your house
and you entered our lives,

1773
02:10:51,566 --> 02:10:52,733
eveything that happened since
had been good to us.

1774
02:10:52,899 --> 02:10:54,800
What's my contribution in this, sir?

1775
02:10:55,466 --> 02:10:58,702
l was worried that l may not conduct
my sister's marriage.

1776
02:10:59,899 --> 02:11:01,367
But this happened because of you.

1777
02:11:02,566 --> 02:11:04,067
What more can l ask for?

1778
02:11:04,966 --> 02:11:07,735
Brother-in-law, l'm going back.

1779
02:11:09,799 --> 02:11:11,000
Where?

1780
02:11:12,599 --> 02:11:13,933
l was happy in America.

1781
02:11:14,099 --> 02:11:17,602
l happily agreed to become in-house
son-in-law to a good family.

1782
02:11:17,766 --> 02:11:19,567
l said yes to anything you said.

1783
02:11:19,733 --> 02:11:20,934
What's my position now, brother-in-law?

1784
02:11:21,599 --> 02:11:22,666
Yes, true!

1785
02:11:22,833 --> 02:11:24,901
Yes, you said yes for anything l said.

1786
02:11:25,899 --> 02:11:28,701
lf l break my promise now,
l've to hang my head in shame.

1787
02:11:30,332 --> 02:11:34,269
As decided earlier,
l'll get you married to Chandrakala.

1788
02:11:37,833 --> 02:11:40,268
There won't be any change in
this decision, this is final.

1789
02:11:46,833 --> 02:11:51,671
l'll conduct this marriage with the
blessings of Lord Mallikarjuna of Srisailam.

1790
02:11:51,833 --> 02:11:52,934
We're leaving tomorrow.

1791
02:11:54,899 --> 02:11:57,134
You're vey lucky, you missed elder sister
but got younger sister.

1792
02:11:57,299 --> 02:12:00,235
l forgot my purse inside.

1793
02:12:02,699 --> 02:12:05,334
l paid the bill,
how come he forgot his purse?

1794
02:12:05,466 --> 02:12:07,568
You take care of such unnecessay things.

1795
02:12:07,733 --> 02:12:09,668
You don't have any tension
about our marriage.

1796
02:12:09,799 --> 02:12:12,501
Do you know how tensed l'm
about my marriage tomorrow?

1797
02:12:12,666 --> 02:12:15,135
Why do you get tensed, Chandu?

1798
02:12:15,299 --> 02:12:17,067
We've 24 hour time!

1799
02:12:17,232 --> 02:12:20,168
Anmay my brain works sharply
when the problem reaches the peak.

1800
02:12:20,332 --> 02:12:21,566
l'll plan something.

1801
02:12:21,733 --> 02:12:26,170
lnstead of plans, why not kill Bharath,
it'll clear the line for us.

1802
02:12:31,032 --> 02:12:33,567
What a powe_ul tongue you've, Chandu?
They're really killing him.

1803
02:12:33,733 --> 02:12:37,336
Chandu, Kesava Reddy's men are
after my life because l'm your son-in-law.

1804
02:13:11,399 --> 02:13:12,500
You sit in the car!

1805
02:13:46,632 --> 02:13:50,569
As you said Venky who is tying
to stop your marriage,

1806
02:13:50,733 --> 02:13:53,735
l've sent our men to kill him.

1807
02:13:55,666 --> 02:13:59,136
l told them to attack you
so that she won't get any doubt.

1808
02:13:59,299 --> 02:14:02,268
You mary her at any cost
and bring her here.

1809
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:07,671
After that l'll make Babji
to lick my leg like a dog.

1810
02:14:09,299 --> 02:14:12,702
Maintain the secret till the marriage
that you're my son.

1811
02:14:13,899 --> 02:14:17,469
After that al the days belong to us.

1812
02:14:25,733 --> 02:14:26,767
Who is he?

1813
02:14:38,766 --> 02:14:42,269
He's Babji's man!
- Kill him, boys!

1814
02:14:48,499 --> 02:14:49,967
l know Bharath is your son.

1815
02:14:52,966 --> 02:14:54,267
Leave him!

1816
02:14:56,466 --> 02:14:57,733
What are you saying?

1817
02:14:58,132 --> 02:15:00,167
Yes, l know Bharath is your son.

1818
02:15:00,332 --> 02:15:02,400
Not iust me, Babii too knows that.

1819
02:15:03,933 --> 02:15:07,503
He's taking him to Srisailam for
marriage and killing him on the way.

1820
02:15:08,232 --> 02:15:09,933
How can l believe you?

1821
02:15:10,532 --> 02:15:12,000
lf you want call him on phone
and inquire.

1822
02:15:18,232 --> 02:15:19,700
Switched off message is coming, right?

1823
02:15:20,399 --> 02:15:22,067
He confiscated his phone also.

1824
02:15:23,065 --> 02:15:25,367
So, saving his life is in your hands.

1825
02:15:39,165 --> 02:15:41,934
What are you saying, Venky?
Is Bharath Kesava Reddy's son?

1826
02:15:42,099 --> 02:15:43,266
Yes.

1827
02:15:43,432 --> 02:15:45,901
Come, let's tell this to my brother.
This marriage will not happen.

1828
02:15:46,065 --> 02:15:50,602
No, better he sees it directly to
know many things than we tell us.

1829
02:15:50,733 --> 02:15:51,366
You mean?

1830
02:15:51,532 --> 02:15:55,068
When we're proceeding to Srisailam,
Kesava Reddy will attack us,

1831
02:15:55,232 --> 02:15:56,933
l'll give a fitting end to this stoy there!

1832
02:16:19,432 --> 02:16:21,534
l suspect someone may attack us, sir.

1833
02:16:21,699 --> 02:16:24,968
Sippy, don't get tensed and trouble sir.

1834
02:16:25,132 --> 02:16:26,733
Who bothers about my problems?

1835
02:16:32,599 --> 02:16:34,467
Look there, sir!

1836
02:16:34,599 --> 02:16:36,067
Looks like villains are about to attack us.

1837
02:16:36,232 --> 02:16:37,967
Look at him, how he's staring at us!

1838
02:16:38,699 --> 02:16:40,834
Sippy, don't get tensed, let's turn right.

1839
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,168
Don't turn right, let's turn left.

1840
02:16:44,165 --> 02:16:46,333
He's getting tensed, go left.

1841
02:17:16,299 --> 02:17:18,834
Kesava Reddy, give us way!

1842
02:17:19,599 --> 02:17:21,934
l don't want bloodshed before
my sister's marriage.

1843
02:17:22,099 --> 02:17:25,836
Babji, hand over my son to me.
- Son?

1844
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,936
lf not nobody will go alive from here.

1845
02:17:29,099 --> 02:17:31,134
Who is your son?

1846
02:17:34,466 --> 02:17:36,568
Don't play drama!

1847
02:17:38,132 --> 02:17:42,402
l know you've planned to
kill my son in Srisailam.

1848
02:17:42,566 --> 02:17:44,901
lf l know who your son is,
l'll kill him right now here.

1849
02:17:45,099 --> 02:17:46,233
No need to go to Srisailam.

1850
02:17:46,399 --> 02:17:49,568
l know you know who my son is!

1851
02:17:49,733 --> 02:17:51,267
Son...son...who your son is!
Tell me!

1852
02:17:51,432 --> 02:17:52,699
Tell me!

1853
02:17:52,866 --> 02:17:55,501
l can understand how foolish
you both are!

1854
02:17:55,666 --> 02:17:56,933
What are you...
- Stop!

1855
02:17:57,799 --> 02:18:00,101
You grew tall like palm tree but no brain!

1856
02:18:00,265 --> 02:18:02,767
You don't know who boxer is and
who the percussionist is!

1857
02:18:02,933 --> 02:18:05,335
Shut up!
Eveything happened because of you.

1858
02:18:06,065 --> 02:18:07,633
l'll open up at least now!

1859
02:18:07,799 --> 02:18:11,169
You think their marriage is a stoy, right?
No, that is true.

1860
02:18:11,332 --> 02:18:13,167
He made you say it was a stoy.

1861
02:18:14,232 --> 02:18:15,666
Son-in-law!
- Son-in-law?

1862
02:18:15,799 --> 02:18:18,067
Who is your son-in-law?
Who do you think she is?

1863
02:18:18,232 --> 02:18:21,201
She's that short man Meka Papa Rao's wife.

1864
02:18:22,666 --> 02:18:25,602
Do you know who they both are?
Meka Venkateswara Rao's parents!

1865
02:18:26,666 --> 02:18:28,667
The woman here, who do you think she is?

1866
02:18:28,833 --> 02:18:31,202
She grew so tall,
she keeps head like this,

1867
02:18:31,366 --> 02:18:34,368
do you think this she's expressionless
like a mannequin?

1868
02:18:34,532 --> 02:18:35,666
She's my wife.

1869
02:18:36,599 --> 02:18:39,802
He played all this drama
to make his love succeed.

1870
02:18:41,699 --> 02:18:43,400
Why do you see like this?
You'll never understand this.

1871
02:18:43,566 --> 02:18:45,200
You'll never understand
how many times l may tell you.

1872
02:18:45,366 --> 02:18:50,370
Your younger sister and
Venky love each other.

1873
02:18:52,265 --> 02:18:53,666
Stop your nonsense!

1874
02:18:54,099 --> 02:18:56,801
What? Is it nonsense?

1875
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:00,937
You've grown tall like a scarecrow,
do you've brain?

1876
02:19:01,099 --> 02:19:03,000
You came here when he called you.

1877
02:19:03,165 --> 02:19:05,400
You revealed your son to him.

1878
02:19:08,432 --> 02:19:12,302
What are you saying?
- Bharath is his son.

1879
02:19:16,165 --> 02:19:18,166
He's the man who told him to attack us.

1880
02:19:37,399 --> 02:19:39,100
Tell them to leave Bharath, brother.

1881
02:19:39,566 --> 02:19:40,333
No!

1882
02:19:40,499 --> 02:19:42,734
lf not l'll cut her neck.

1883
02:19:44,632 --> 02:19:45,299
Tell them.

1884
02:19:45,466 --> 02:19:47,334
Leave him.

1885
02:20:03,065 --> 02:20:03,732
Brother!

1886
02:20:05,966 --> 02:20:13,173
l wanted to take your sister to my house,
torture her and bring you to my knees.

1887
02:20:13,399 --> 02:20:14,666
He stopped me.

1888
02:20:15,265 --> 02:20:19,469
He stopped me again for
your younger sister also.

1889
02:20:19,632 --> 02:20:21,166
Both got saved.

1890
02:20:21,699 --> 02:20:27,704
Will you make me a fool
by making me say who my son is?

1891
02:20:28,799 --> 02:20:31,368
l'll get them married now.

1892
02:20:32,532 --> 02:20:33,900
Let me see who will dare stop it.

1893
02:20:43,232 --> 02:20:46,568
Why did you plan action scene
first for TV serial?

1894
02:20:46,733 --> 02:20:48,935
Fearing producer may
not give budget for climax,

1895
02:20:49,099 --> 02:20:51,901
so l planned a grand climax
as first scene.

1896
02:20:52,099 --> 02:20:52,732
What's the scene?

1897
02:20:52,899 --> 02:20:53,399
Give me the file.

1898
02:20:53,566 --> 02:20:56,902
Villain is taking away your sister.

1899
02:20:57,099 --> 02:20:59,201
You stop the vehicles going
opposite to it.

1900
02:20:59,366 --> 02:21:01,367
Scene has full emotions.

1901
02:21:02,399 --> 02:21:03,833
Sister character is Tamil or Kannada girl?

1902
02:21:04,032 --> 02:21:05,299
Don't l know your range?

1903
02:21:05,466 --> 02:21:07,768
lncluding villain all the characters
are from Bombay.

1904
02:21:07,933 --> 02:21:11,236
What's my character's name?
- Dumbu, 6 feet atom bomb!

1905
02:21:11,399 --> 02:21:14,034
There's push in it!
l'll push eveyone!

1906
02:21:16,733 --> 02:21:18,668
Tell her to shut up!

1907
02:21:35,966 --> 02:21:42,439
He's a combination of all the Gods...

1908
02:21:43,032 --> 02:21:47,069
He won't talk, his silence blows
like atom bomb..

1909
02:21:47,232 --> 02:21:50,068
He'll settle the accounts
then and there itself...

1910
02:21:59,399 --> 02:22:00,433
Who are you?

1911
02:22:00,599 --> 02:22:04,836
Ask lions in the forest,
ask crocodiles in water,

1912
02:22:05,032 --> 02:22:07,167
ask bullets inside a gun,

1913
02:22:08,032 --> 02:22:10,367
they'll tell who a l!
- What do you want, man?

1914
02:22:10,532 --> 02:22:12,734
Leave my sister respectfully.

1915
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:15,834
Your sister?

1916
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,836
lt's better to tell the ne_ dialogue
Iooking at camera.

1917
02:22:19,833 --> 02:22:21,768
l know my sister is with you.

1918
02:22:21,933 --> 02:22:23,868
Why are you looking that side
while talking?

1919
02:22:24,032 --> 02:22:25,400
Whichever direction l may see,
the news is the same.

1920
02:22:25,566 --> 02:22:28,568
Leave my sister.
- Leave her? l'll hack you.

1921
02:22:28,733 --> 02:22:33,204
l'm not coconut leaf or plant to hack!

1922
02:22:33,366 --> 02:22:34,800
Dumbu! l'm 6 feet atom bomb!

1923
02:22:35,232 --> 02:22:36,633
He looks like a mad man.

1924
02:22:36,799 --> 02:22:39,701
Show him what real bomb is!

1925
02:22:39,866 --> 02:22:40,733
See this!

1926
02:22:46,165 --> 02:22:49,501
Bomb will not go off
if you don't remove the pin!

1927
02:22:51,399 --> 02:22:53,501
You can't scare me with bombs.

1928
02:22:53,733 --> 02:22:58,104
Potassium used for bombs
are produced in my farms.

1929
02:22:58,299 --> 02:23:00,901
Ammonium is stocked in my stores.

1930
02:23:01,065 --> 02:23:03,734
We grow phosphorus in my backyard.

1931
02:23:04,065 --> 02:23:05,566
Tell me now, boys...

1932
02:23:07,799 --> 02:23:13,838
Give us way if not l'll kill her.

1933
02:23:23,532 --> 02:23:25,166
Leave her!

1934
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:27,667
Leave me.

1935
02:23:28,265 --> 02:23:30,100
Who is he? He's taller than me.

1936
02:23:30,966 --> 02:23:31,866
Who are you, man?

1937
02:23:32,032 --> 02:23:34,334
Why did you make a sudden enty
and delivering my lines?

1938
02:23:34,466 --> 02:23:36,501
This is single star not
a multi-starrer, right?

1939
02:23:37,299 --> 02:23:41,202
Two heroes are clashing here,
why are you inte_ering, you villain?

1940
02:23:41,899 --> 02:23:45,502
My boys would've asked you to come
in confusion, take your payment and leave.

1941
02:23:45,666 --> 02:23:47,734
You mad man,
it's you who should go not me.

1942
02:23:53,065 --> 02:23:54,266
Catch them, boys!

1943
02:23:57,165 --> 02:24:00,067
He came, he blew,
he's taking away my sister.

1944
02:24:00,232 --> 02:24:01,333
ls he hero or me?

1945
02:24:01,499 --> 02:24:03,767
This is not multi starrer,
this is single starrer!

1946
02:24:03,933 --> 02:24:05,167
l'm coming!

1947
02:24:27,799 --> 02:24:28,733
Stop!

1948
02:24:29,466 --> 02:24:31,000
What's this running pe_ormance?

1949
02:24:31,165 --> 02:24:33,100
Nobody is following you with a camera.

1950
02:24:33,265 --> 02:24:34,933
First time l'm doing an action serial.

1951
02:24:35,099 --> 02:24:37,167
Don't dominate my heroism.

1952
02:24:37,332 --> 02:24:39,734
Leave my sister...leave her!

1953
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,435
Fighters are coming,
Ieave my sister and move aside.

1954
02:24:43,599 --> 02:24:45,400
Show your heroism on them!

1955
02:24:50,165 --> 02:24:51,933
What exactly is happening here?

1956
02:25:36,232 --> 02:25:39,034
He took away the girl and
showed his heroism.

1957
02:25:39,199 --> 02:25:40,900
Are you here to show your villainy?

1958
02:25:41,065 --> 02:25:42,466
Won't you allow me to act as hero?

1959
02:25:42,632 --> 02:25:44,467
What's your concept?

1960
02:25:44,632 --> 02:25:45,833
Leave her.

1961
02:26:26,366 --> 02:26:27,667
Why did you push me?

1962
02:26:27,833 --> 02:26:29,834
To get sympathy from your brother.

1963
02:26:30,666 --> 02:26:31,833
How dare you push my sister!

1964
02:26:49,532 --> 02:26:50,933
Watch now! How your brother will react!

1965
02:26:51,099 --> 02:26:52,266
You too act a little!

1966
02:26:54,199 --> 02:26:57,702
Though you cheated all these days,
you took the risk today!

1967
02:27:01,866 --> 02:27:05,169
You made me come to your house
to make me realize your love.

1968
02:27:05,499 --> 02:27:09,269
l've understood your love and
sending my sister to your house.

1969
02:27:14,766 --> 02:27:16,167
lsn't it a valley?

1970
02:27:18,232 --> 02:27:20,801
l understood one thing clearly.
- What's that?

1971
02:27:20,966 --> 02:27:24,669
lf we've one thing, we can win God also
not just this Babji!

1972
02:27:24,866 --> 02:27:26,634
What's that?
- Worldliness!

1973
02:27:30,632 --> 02:27:33,568
l thought it was mock fight
but entered a real fight.

1974
02:27:34,833 --> 02:27:36,167
Where's the director?

1975
02:27:36,566 --> 02:27:37,900
They thrashed me.

1977
02:27:42,966 --> 02:27:45,802

1978
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:47,334
l'm action director Bombula Bose.

1979
02:27:47,499 --> 02:27:48,566
Tell me, sir.

1980
02:27:48,733 --> 02:27:51,702
l want to make an action serial with you.

1981
02:27:51,866 --> 02:27:56,070
l don't want to do action!

1982
02:27:56,933 --> 02:27:58,401
Comedy is chill, sir!
