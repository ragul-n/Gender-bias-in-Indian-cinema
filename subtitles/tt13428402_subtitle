2
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:46,087
Ah, so satisfied drinking.

3
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:50,049
Ah, so lazy to go home.

4
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,343
Just stay overnight, Suneo.

5
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,387
But Dekisugi also drank a lot, right?

6
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,889
I use the "Wake Up Soon"
gadget so I'm not drunk.

7
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,723
Me too.

8
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,935
Haha, you two are really boring.

9
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:04,021
Why drink if you wake up quickly?

10
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:08,109
Goodbye, Nobita!
Don't get lost on the road, OK.

11
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,402
Okay, Gian.

12
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:14,407
Yeah, but he's on auto-drive,
so there's no way to get lost.

13
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,534
That's right, hahaha.

14
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,079
Sorry, I can't come tomorrow.

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,832
There is a sudden work, right?
That can't be help.

16
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,293
Being an elite person
is indeed difficult, huh.

17
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:27,336
Bye, yes.

18
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,298
Goal: Go home. Go, scooter.

19
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,925
Tomorrow, don't be late, you know!

20
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,427
I know too!

21
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,933
Finally tomorrow comes the day.
His wedding day.

22
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,728
Even though he is just Nobita.

23
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,077
Doraemon...

24
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:34,487
We'll see the wedding
day next time, shall we?

25
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,990
Okay. Let's hurry back to our times.

26
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,744
I also want to meet Shizuka at my dinner.

27
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,118
Birthday, birthday!

28
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:25,329
I am home!
Mom, what's for lunch today?

29
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,415
Nobita!

30
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,669
I found this in your desk drawer!

31
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,090
Can't we talk about this later?

32
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,174
Today it's...

33
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,676
It is enough!

34
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:42,638
I'm not angry because you got zero points,
but because you hid this paper!

35
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,558
Mom didn't teach you
to be a child like that!

36
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:50,312
Why do you have to be mad
about this on summer vacation?

37
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,523
How embarrassing it really is.

38
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,613
Today is bad too, huh.

39
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,824
Even though you don't
have to be that angry.

40
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:06,287
Nothing can be done, right?
Because you're the one at fault.

41
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,540
But today is my birthday.

42
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:14,837
Could it be...
Oh, yeah. It must be!

43
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,922
Hah? What have you
been talking about earlier?

44
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:20,002
I am not the biological
child of this family.

45
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:21,969
They must have picked
me up from somewhere.

46
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,805
Hahaha, how stupid.

47
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,017
If I were their real child,
Mother wouldn't speak that badly!

48
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:31,729
After all, if I really am their son,
why did they name me Nobita?

49
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,856
Isn't that a common name, huh?

50
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,358
I want a cooler name!

51
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:44,158
Ah, where is my biological mother?

52
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,118
You're talking ridiculous.

53
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,622
What are you doing up there, Doraemon?

54
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,917
Oh, I'm checking my magic gadgets.

55
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:58,881
If the floor is messy, so I use this
Gravity Paint to work on the ceiling.

56
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,343
Now, lots of it, huh.

57
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,694
Nobita, don't hold it
carelessly, you know. I just

58
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:09,266
want to test whether these
gadgets are damaged or not.

59
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,769
Uh, don't touch it carelessly!

60
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,895
What is that?

61
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:16,148
This is the "Stick of Forgetfulness".

62
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:20,152
If we use this stick, we can
forget what happened before.

63
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,628
Eh?! If you hit Mom
using that stick earlier,

64
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,534
she doesn't have
to be angry like that.

65
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,537
I wont use this wand
for something like that!

66
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:33,165
Don't say that, please.
I want to borrow it.

67
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,514
Instead of that, you
better study harder,

68
00:05:36,526 --> 00:05:40,047
so you don't need to
get another zero score.

69
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,049
How can I be!?

70
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:50,099
See! There is more!

71
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,186
Already collected a lot, huh.

72
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,481
Please, lend me that gadget!

73
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,276
If not, please hide this in
your magic pocket, please!

74
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,987
Cannot!

75
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:06,699
How it come to this?
If she see this, surely...

76
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,536
This is from the future department store.

77
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,206
What is that?

78
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:19,545
Sometimes, they like to send
sample items like this one.

79
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,714
Oh, I see?

80
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,967
Let us see

81
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,011
Soul Swapping Ropes?

82
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,971
Wait, again, you just grabbed it!

83
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:29,972
Changing.

84
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,484
Exchange completed.

85
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:46,614
Whoa, what is this? Very weird!

86
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:50,743
So this rope can be used to turn us into
someone else who also holds this rope.

87
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:54,913
I became Doraemon!

88
00:06:54,914 --> 00:07:00,044
Hm, hm, so that's how it is.
If we use the rope one more time...

89
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,170
Back to normal.

90
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,426
Oh, so this is it!

91
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:15,893
If so, can we not take it back one more
time, so I won't be nagged by Mother?

92
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,686
Don't talk carelessly!

93
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,188
You really can't, can you?

94
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:26,487
Nobita! Nobita? Nobita!

95
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,281
Oh, is that so?

96
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,949
Are you alright?

97
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,787
Hahaha, it worked!

98
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,498
Are you alright? Nobita!

99
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,124
Yes, I'm fine.

100
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,462
I have to hurry and save both of us.

101
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,340
Nobita! Nobita!

102
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:54,556
Where the hell is he?

103
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,936
Eh? Me why?

104
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:02,439
Suddenly they drove me
here on a time machine.

105
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,857
Who?

106
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,818
You and I!

107
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:11,407
Hey Nobita, I do not understand
at all what you are talking about.

108
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:15,327
But I can only. Say that.

109
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,956
Hm, I don't understand.

110
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,959
Looks like something happened somewhere.

111
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,380
Yeah, but now I'm here,
so no problem, right?

112
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:30,300
Really, you are so relaxed!

113
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,469
What's more important is this!

114
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,471
We have to find a place
to hide, so it won't be found!

115
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:39,935
Rather than that, wouldn't it
be easier if you just studied?

116
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,687
You are very talkative, Doraemon.

117
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:46,108
Nobita, go shopping for a while.

118
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,484
It's Mother!

119
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,820
There is something that I want you to buy.

120
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,745
Just recently, mom said you too much.

121
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,043
Eh? Very weird.

122
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:10,090
I thought he was here. Where did he go?

123
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,096
It's very dangerous.

124
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,684
Oh, I found a great place!

125
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,438
This way it's safe.

126
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,940
Oh? It's..

127
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:30,819
Wow, I missed you so much!

128
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,782
This teddy bear that I
loved when I was little.

129
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,284
Lots of patches, huh?

130
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,079
Yes, Grandma fixed this.

131
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,164
You have Grandma?

132
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:45,000
She died when I was in kindergarten.

133
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,597
This is it!

134
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:02,184
The person who's Nobita hugging, right?

135
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,229
Looks like the person
is very friendly, huh.

136
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,441
Grandma always spoiled me.

137
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:23,580
Gian... Gian broke my doll!

138
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:28,418
Wow, what a pity.

139
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:40,097
This, in this way, the
bear is no longer sick.

140
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,473
Grandma!

141
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,560
Whoa, walah...

142
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:48,355
Nobita is really a spoiled child.

143
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,526
So you've been whiny and
spoiled from then on, huh?

144
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,511
What I want to talk about is
Grandma's kindness and warmth!

145
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,430
Listen carefully, please!

146
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,390
Sorry Sorry!

147
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,653
Hah? Why, Nobita?

148
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,032
I want to meet...

149
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:40,908
Hah?

150
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:45,120
I want to see Grandma one more time!

151
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,623
If you say that too..

152
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:51,293
Oh yes! If we use a time
machine, we can go back in time.

153
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,045
Better not.

154
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:53,837
Why not?

155
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:57,925
If Grandma saw that you suddenly became
an adult, what do you think would happen?

156
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,552
Surely he will be
shocked and fall and slip!

157
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,679
If we talk carefully, she will understand!

158
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,557
You think you can understand time machine!?

159
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,811
But, but...

160
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:15,609
Oh yes! How about we just look from afar?

161
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,653
We can hide somewhere.

162
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,283
After seeing her for a while,
come back straight home, huh?

163
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,576
Hooray!

164
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,453
Let's go!

165
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,712
Wait a minute!

166
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,800
We go back to when I was 3 years old.

167
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,806
We're leaving, here.

168
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:46,556
Okay!

169
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:07,077
Wow, I missed you so
much! Home in the past!

170
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,997
There's still a litter box!

171
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,624
Oh, Persimmon fruit tree!

172
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,169
Two years ago, this tree was cut down.

173
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:21,008
Nobita, if anyone sees us it could be
dangerous. Hurry and look at Grandma!

174
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,802
Oh yes.

175
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:28,724
Grandma is always in this room.

176
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,893
Remember, yes. Well only see her from afar.

177
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,905
You know?

178
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:47,117
Nothing. What's on the second floor?

179
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:08,889
This door has always been jammed.

180
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,183
If it can't be pulled, try to push it.

181
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,895
Who are you?

182
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,733
Now, so young!

183
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:20,817
Is it true?

184
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:24,571
But 7 years later, her face
became covered with wrinkles.

185
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,447
Yes yes.

186
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,826
What the hell are you guys going
into someone's house! Get out there!

187
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,124
Even though it's me. Doesn't she know?

188
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,710
How could she possibly know?

189
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,715
Looks like Grandma went out.

190
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,595
That was me when I was 3 years old!

191
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:52,849
How cute. The one now isn't cute at all.

192
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,351
What the heck?

193
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,444
Nobita, don't cry.

194
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,613
It's Shizuka!

195
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,740
Let's play house.

196
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,245
Come on, I'll take you home.

197
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,168
Nobita is very whiny, huh.

198
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,133
I took the candy.

199
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,139
Why are you making fun of me?

200
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,057
Stop it. They're just kids!

201
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:37,602
Yesterday they pushed me down at school!

202
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,063
Don't mix the past with the present!

203
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,322
Grandma!

204
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,672
Grandma is alive...

205
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,174
Grandma is alive... Grandma is walking...

206
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,685
Dad, go to work first, okay.

207
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,563
Okay, be careful.

208
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,773
Here's your lunch.

209
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:24,900
Thank you.

210
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:31,990
Wow, wow...
Nobita and Shizuka are very close, huh.

211
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:32,908
Grandma!

212
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,203
Have you bought fireworks, haven't you?

213
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:41,708
Forgive me. Grandma has
been around to all the toy stores.

214
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:46,838
But they only sell fireworks in summer.

215
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,840
Don't want, don't want!

216
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,383
Forgive me.

217
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,469
You don't sulk like that, please.

218
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,888
I want fireworks!

219
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,599
Yes, sorry, yes.

220
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,937
Shut up! I hate Grandma! Get in the house!

221
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,313
Yes yes.

222
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,111
I don't like Nobita like that!

223
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:19,246
Hey, me! Don't be so
mean to Grandma, please!

224
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,045
What are you doing?

225
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:30,757
Why are you teasing my son?

226
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:38,014
Um, er... all of this has a reason...

227
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:39,516
Reason?

228
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:44,521
Actually I am Nobita.

229
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,524
Nobita is this kid, you know.

230
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:52,696
No, I'm from the future...

231
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,030
What a pity...

232
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,783
What a freak.

233
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:01,413
That's not it... Wait!

234
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:06,001
See? How could they believe.

235
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:10,797
Satisfied, right?
You saw Grandma, let's go home.

236
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,099
Okay, let's go.

237
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,517
Once again!

238
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,402
Ah, you were that weird kid earlier!

239
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,653
Mother!

240
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,951
Is he really here?

241
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,245
Geez, to enter the house.

242
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,122
How scary.

243
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,332
Here, here.

244
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,836
Whose child is he?

245
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:58,678
Grandma, did a strange
child come into this room?

246
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,347
No.

247
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,515
Hah?

248
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,729
Seriously, where is he hiding, huh?

249
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:12,609
How about this? Do I
have to go to the police?

250
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,612
Thank you.

251
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,706
Grandma, don't you suspect me?

252
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,707
No.

253
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:33,505
Grandma, do you really love Nobita?

254
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:37,008
Yes, of course.

255
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:44,099
If possible, Grandma wanted
to always be by his side.

256
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:51,064
But no way, huh? Grandma is already old.

257
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:54,025
Don't talk so pathetic!

258
00:19:55,903 --> 00:20:02,659
At the very least, Grandma
wants to see him get to school.

259
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:08,998
Seeing him wearing a
backpack and going to school...

260
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,212
Want to see it just once.

261
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,011
Wait a minute, please!

262
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:30,103
I have to wait until when? Damnit!

263
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,190
Doraemon! Backpack, backpack!

264
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,568
What the heck? Backpack?

265
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,862
I want to get my backpack!

266
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,408
Backpack, backpack!

267
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,829
Just stop it already!

268
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,216
Grandma.

269
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,844
Oh...

270
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:07,849
Maybe you doesn't
believe it, but I'm Nobita.

271
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,020
That is true.

272
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:16,232
From earlier Grandma thought so too.

273
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,986
You believe it?
Don't doubt it at all?

274
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:25,700
Who doubts Nobita's talk?

275
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,869
Grandma!

276
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:36,503
There, there. You are so spoiled, huh.

277
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:46,387
After seeing you in elementary
school, Grandma thought.

278
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:54,103
Grandma wants to see your bride just once.

279
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:01,402
I understand, Grandma.
I'll show my bride to you.

280
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,615
Wait for me, yes, Grandma.

281
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:06,616
Nobita.

282
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,117
Doraemon!

283
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,620
Grandma believes you!

284
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:13,498
Yes! Look, I want to show
Grandma a look at the future.

285
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:19,128
But is it alright, making
a promise like that?

286
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,882
The future can still change!

287
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,010
But recently we saw my future, right?

288
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:32,308
We can't say for sure that you
are 100% going to marry Shizuka.

289
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,646
Oh yes. Time Television!

290
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,147
Take out Time Television!

291
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,941
Yes yes.

292
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:47,031
The wedding venue was at
the Prince Melon Hotel, right?

293
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,284
Is it alright?

294
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,587
It can't be. Not connected, here.

295
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:03,298
If he doesn't come quickly
it could be bad, right?

296
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,467
What is Nobita doing, anyway?

297
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:09,387
Ah, that's right!

298
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,307
Until the last second it was too late.

299
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,434
How pathetic.

300
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,687
He couldn't not have come, could he?

301
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:23,776
But there are stories, where the bride
and groom run away on their wedding day...

302
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,947
No way, right?

303
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:33,786
Nobita... Nobita, is everything okay?

304
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,622
Grandma!

305
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,957
Good afternoon, I am Doraemon.

306
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:41,210
Yes, good afternoon.

307
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,588
Doraemon who brought me here.

308
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:47,592
If so, thank you, yes, good raccoon.

309
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:51,679
I'm not a raccoon, you know.

310
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,099
Grandma wait a little longer, yes.

311
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,685
I will definitely meet
Grandma with my bride.

312
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:01,356
Isn't it a hassle?

313
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:05,693
Grandma has made strange wishes.

314
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:11,074
It is okay. I just need a little more time.

315
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,618
A little bit more! But
there is no problem, really.

316
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:19,123
Oh, I see? Then just slow down.

317
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:19,707
Okay!

318
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:27,215
Grandma will wait here.

319
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,681
We'll be home soon!

320
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,977
Let's go to wedding day!

321
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:44,816
It's about you, so we don't know
what problem you created this time.

322
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:04,419
Ah, it's raining.

323
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,295
Nobita, hurry up!

324
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,088
Okay!

325
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,563
Let's hide there.

326
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,912
Maybe he got lost inside the hotel.

327
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,373
Maybe. Let us find!

328
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,708
Come on, let's follow them.

329
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,793
Shizuka!

330
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:49,338
I can't just stand by.

331
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,633
How beautiful!

332
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,969
Just leave it to us!

333
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,637
Where's Nobita?

334
00:25:56,638 --> 00:26:00,892
Sorry, Shizuka. Also sorry to your parents.

335
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:04,479
It is okay. We're just worried.

336
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,397
Let's go there, get closer.

337
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,482
Okay.

338
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:13,112
Where is the boy?
Even though he came out before us.

339
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:16,282
As long as there is no accident, it's okay.

340
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:19,494
But that kid was so careless.

341
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:24,540
There is currently no news of
any accidents around here at all.

342
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:31,130
I wonder why, Nobita?

343
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:36,636
Um, it looks like you guys are worried.

344
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:39,305
But the time is near...

345
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:43,810
Geez, why didn't he come?

346
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:46,896
So it's true. He didn't have
confidence in himself, so he ran away.

347
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,731
It can't be that!

348
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,736
Nobita will definitely come!

349
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:03,830
What is this? How about this?
Troublesome for everyone like this...

350
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:09,502
Will the marriage be canceled?
Do something, please, Doraemon!

351
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,796
Only you can replace, right?

352
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,050
Before you have to wear
this and become an adult.

353
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,344
No, no, I can't!

354
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,471
There is only this way!

355
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,139
I can't!

356
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,516
Get caught!

357
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,317
I will follow you, really.

358
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:37,446
I don't understand anything about marriage!

359
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,698
Nobita!

360
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,494
Nobita! What are you doing until this time?

361
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:48,583
Nobiita, are you okay? What happened?

362
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,588
Um...

363
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:58,217
Oh yeah, l-l got lost on the way.

364
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,182
That's right.

365
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,017
He really is Nobita.

366
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:10,730
Come on, everyone in the
party room. Please enter.

367
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:11,814
Please.

368
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,524
"Small Light".

369
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:57,693
Hey, look at that.

370
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:03,658
Nobita's teeth are grinding.

371
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,205
Is it alright?

372
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,708
I'm here, really.

373
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,796
That's very worrying.

374
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:19,131
Start, that's it.

375
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:16,856
Nobita, do you vow to marry Shizuka
and love her in good times and bad times?

376
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:20,526
Vow to be with her until the end?

377
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,284
Nobita, do you swear?

378
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:29,910
Are you alright?

379
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:36,334
Ah, his head is empty.

380
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,085
What should I do?

381
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:38,919
Oh yes!

382
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,803
Oh, sorry!

383
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,932
It's fine.

384
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,937
I swear!

385
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:00,524
Is it okay if I do it?

386
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,152
The real one didn't come,
so it can't be helped, right?

387
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,366
It feels so weird!

388
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:21,170
Now is the time for our bride
and groom to kiss each other.

389
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:23,214
Kiss?

390
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:29,220
Nobita?

391
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:45,069
Wow, all this can be eaten, right?

392
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:49,824
Nobita, you are really relaxed,
after making a fuss like that.

393
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:52,326
How delicious!

394
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,413
Hey, Nobita.

395
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,706
If you are too excited you
can get caught, you know!

396
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,166
Congratulations, yes, Shizuka.

397
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,001
Thank you.

398
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,007
Did I catch a cold, okay?

399
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:12,096
Everyone, please pay attention.

400
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:17,226
Our bride and groom are
going to cut the cake now.

401
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:22,898
First, let's make the
cake here. Please watch it.

402
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,234
Those who want to see
closely are also allowed.

403
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:26,902
Let's go.

404
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:33,868
I couldn't believe it had rained suddenly.

405
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:38,706
But it's okay. This is a gardening
party room with a see-through roof.

406
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:43,127
We are given the use of this room because
the owner is an acquaintance of my father.

407
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,427
Great! Great!

408
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,227
Looks delicious.

409
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,939
Hugh!

410
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:10,404
The cake is finished, please cut it.

411
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:16,494
'Hah?

412
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:17,495
What is wrong?

413
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,705
There is only one knife, you know.

414
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:23,626
What are you saying?
We'll both hold the knife.

415
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,920
Hehe, that's right, yeah.

416
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:29,548
Nobita, cut it quickly!

417
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:35,971
This cake cutting will be the first
activity the couple will do together.

418
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:40,017
Nobita, look here, please!

419
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:46,690
Nobita, Shizuka,
congratulations on your marriage.

420
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,735
Even though you can only
get 0 points in the past...

421
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:55,074
I'm happy you can be a good
man and get married today.

422
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:00,829
Now, marriage is really fun, huh...

423
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,840
Oh, right, Shizuka became suspicious.

424
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,301
Eh, really?

425
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:19,807
Now, let us hear the remarks from
our groom, Nobita Nobi.

426
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:24,103
Oh, okay, remarks, right?

427
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,528
Good afternoon!

428
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:38,742
Ah? Why? What is wrong?

429
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:43,372
Not good afternoon.
You've thought about the speech, right?

430
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:46,417
Eh? Speech?

431
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:51,297
Oh, yeah, so you mean that, huh?

432
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:56,010
Where will I put it?

433
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:58,512
I don't know, you know.

434
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:03,142
If I'm not mistaken... here, right?

435
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:06,395
No, this is it?

436
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:07,896
There can't be.

437
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,692
Oh yes!

438
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:17,990
Hahaha, how could I forget that...
Looks like I left it in the waiting room.

439
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,409
I'll take it first, yes!

440
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:26,373
! 11 Looks like our groom
has to get ready first.

441
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,334
Let's wait.

442
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,631
We're really sorry...

443
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,594
The bride and groom are such a pain.

444
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:40,929
Wait a minute, give me the mic.

445
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:52,524
Everyone! While waiting
for Nobita to return...

446
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:57,863
I, as his best friend,
will sing for all of you.

447
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:00,115
Hey... Wait... Sorry, huh...

448
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,701
Gian, let's go back to the seats.

449
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,662
Shut up, leave me alone!

450
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:05,663
Let's just have a drink.

451
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,706
Music, start!

452
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:15,839
Buttobasu denjarasu!
Am strong and dangerous!

453
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,175
Ore Gian!
I am Gian!

454
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,220
Ittoushou. Addokkoishou! I beat everyone!

455
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:24,973
What are you doing? Gian is singing!

456
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:30,688
Even here too, the singing
can break your head!

457
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:36,777
The only way we have
is to find my adult self!

458
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:40,489
At this rate, the wedding
party could be ruined!

459
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,742
Nobita, go back quickly!

460
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:46,286
I can't! I don't know
what greeting speech is!

461
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,497
You just need to talk
about yourself, right?

462
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:54,378
I can't! We have to find the grown me!

463
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:08,058
By the way, isn't the greeting speech
"Good Morning" or "Good Afternoon", huh?

464
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:13,105
In a place like that, greeting
means thanking your parents.

465
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:17,734
Be thankful? They Always
get mad when I get 0 points!

466
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,446
Impossible impossible!

467
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:22,531
You're still talking about that.

468
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:29,079
He's nowhere.

469
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,040
Oh, yeah, let's just use the search stick.

470
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,375
What is that?

471
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:36,920
The stick can be a signpost
for the person we want to find.

472
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,465
Heh, very practical.

473
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:46,930
Why?

474
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,309
Remember when we came here?

475
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,230
Tidying up magic gadgets.

476
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:04,448
You were in a hurry, I was
panicking too, that's why I missed a lot.

477
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:07,409
How about we go back to the
original world and take it first?

478
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,328
We don't have time.

479
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,413
Don’t worry.

480
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,459
For example, we leave at 2.

481
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:20,923
We go back to the origin
and waste 1 hour there.

482
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:23,091
Keep going back to the future.

483
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:30,933
When we go out we put it in 5
minutes, so it's 2 past 5 o'clock.

484
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:33,936
Finally we only waste 5 minutes.

485
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:36,813
Doraemon, you are so smart.

486
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:44,613
Not really, ah.

487
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:46,281
Let's go to the time machine place.

488
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:46,990
Okay!

489
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,930
Ah! That's right...

490
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:11,348
There he is!

491
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:15,811
Geez, just make people
worry. He didn't fall asleep, right?

492
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,902
It is nothing.

493
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,195
Do not tell me...

494
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,115
W-Wait! Where are you going?

495
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,116
Toilet!

496
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,076
Are you dying?

497
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,494
Don't talk stupid like that!

498
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,750
This isn't the one!

499
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,044
Nothing! Nothing!

500
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,129
Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!

501
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,755
Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!

502
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,009
It's not anywhere!

503
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,427
What happened?

504
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:51,013
The time machine was taken by someone!

505
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,015
By whom?

506
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:57,519
There is only one person who
can drive a time machine today.

507
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,399
Your adult self!

508
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:07,821
Geez, haphazardly riding time machine.

509
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:12,159
Did he go to another era?
Your adult self.

510
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,994
But why?

511
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:17,414
I do not know? He is you!

512
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,708
Don't you have any ideas?

513
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:23,670
I do not know?
He's me from the future.

514
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:32,012
Ah... no him, not you.
Nobita is always like that.

515
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,305
Forgive me.

516
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,809
What is wrong?

517
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:43,357
So we can't go home from this era?

518
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:50,447
This has happened before.
You can do something, right?

519
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:55,494
Everything will be all right, right, Doraemon?
Oh yes! What about the Time Belt?

520
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,454
I told you...

521
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,706
Being tidied up.

522
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:03,168
Everything that could help
us get home was left behind.

523
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,130
How about it, Doraemon?

524
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:11,843
Well, we have to live
in this era like this...

525
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,817
am hungry.

526
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:30,654
Surely everyone has come
home from the party venue.

527
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,409
Everything must be messy.

528
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:40,122
Of the gadgets here, is there anything that
can be used to return home or not, huh?

529
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,881
This is it! We can use this!

530
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,636
"Soul Time Machine"!

531
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,888
"Soul Time Machine"?

532
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:01,268
This gadget will absorb your soul
and send it to you in a different era.

533
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:07,190
With this, we can send your
soul to the moment before we left.

534
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,961
At that time, the time
machine was still there, so you

535
00:42:09,973 --> 00:42:12,654
could use the time machine
and come back here, right?

536
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,908
If you try it, you will understand.

537
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,919
Please, yes, Nobita!

538
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:55,072
Hey, if we do it one more time, don't
you the one who will be nagged by Mother?

539
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,656
Don't talk carelessly!

540
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:10,045
Nobita! Nobita! Nobita!

541
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,714
Oh, so it's like this, huh?

542
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,007
Are you alright?

543
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:18,220
It worked!

544
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:20,931
Are you okay, Nobita?

545
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,183
Yes I'm fine.

546
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:26,937
I have to hurry and save both of us.

547
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,648
Nobita? Nobita!

548
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,155
Is he all right?

549
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:42,619
Looks like he's taking a nap.

550
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,414
This is indeed hobby, hahaha.

551
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:51,336
Ah, what a mess.

552
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:55,423
Doraemon!

553
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:58,343
Nobita!

554
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,554
I got the time machine!

555
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,021
Then, let's return it to normal, OK.

556
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:10,730
Okay.

557
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,615
It worked!

558
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:23,702
Eh? Me why?

559
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:26,121
I have two?

560
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:28,915
This is the future, right?

561
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,585
Stop it. Do not worry about it.

562
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,420
What is it?

563
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:35,422
Alright, really.

564
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:40,719
Hey, why am I suddenly in the future?

565
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,680
Why there are two me?

566
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,057
Do not worry about it.

567
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:49,394
How could that be? Please explain!

568
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:59,029
Before it got complicated, we
made this Nobita forget about it.

569
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,406
This forgetful stick is useful too, huh.

570
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:05,160
Eh? Why am I here?

571
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:07,787
No, don't think about it.

572
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:16,379
Duh, where is he?

573
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:24,095
Hah? Me why?
They took me there on a time machine.

574
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,472
Who?

575
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,808
This way, we can rest easy.

576
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,769
Oh, no!

577
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:34,272
Nobita, go shopping for a bit!

578
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,565
It's Mother!

579
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:39,069
Hurry up and hide here!

580
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,744
Just recently, mom said too much.

581
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,748
If you're there, please answer...

582
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:59,756
Well, now... where is
the adult Nobita, huh?

583
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:15,105
What does it mean?

584
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:19,943
Nobita who has grown
up may exist in this era.

585
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,939
I have no reason to meet you guys.

586
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,901
Especially after I said
that half a year ago.

587
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,487
Do you want to meet Doraemon?

588
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,698
No, I don't have to.

589
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:12,370
Doraemon is your friend...
my friend when I was little.

590
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:16,583
Oh yes!

591
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:18,418
What's wrong?

592
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:21,880
By the way, why did you
run away from the wedding?

593
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:24,299
Don't you like Shizuka anymore?

594
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,635
How could that be!
I like her! I really love her!

595
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:31,890
Being able to marry
Shizuka is truly a dream.

596
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:33,266
But?

597
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,603
But what?

598
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:40,239
Yesterday, after
drinking with friends and I

599
00:47:40,251 --> 00:47:43,735
was alone, I was
thinking about the future.

600
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:51,409
Then, I got scared
Afraid... Afraid... So scared!

601
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,619
Afraid of what?

602
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:58,875
Since I'm like this, maybe I
can't make Shizuka happy!

603
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,127
Why are you so weak?

604
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:06,257
After all, you also know why
Shizuka wanted to marry me, right?

605
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:09,928
She felt that I was unreliable.

606
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:15,308
Nobita has not changed at all, huh.

607
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:20,313
If we let it go, we don't know
what will happen, I get worried.

608
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,900
1 understand.

609
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:30,782
If she married me for a reason
like that, pity Shizuka herself!

610
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:35,578
She's too kind.

611
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,289
So that's why you came back to this time?

612
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:42,001
At that time, I happened
to go to a public toilet.

613
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:53,930
Why is there a time machine here?

614
00:48:55,141 --> 00:49:01,062
I don't care where the machine
takes me. I just want time to think.

615
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:04,075
The reason I return
to this time is because

616
00:49:04,087 --> 00:49:07,318
the time machine is
set to return to this time.

617
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,029
So that's the reason you left the wedding?

618
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:14,200
Don't you think you've
been a bother for everyone?

619
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:19,956
Don’t worry. When I got more confident, I
would go back to my wedding party, really.

620
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,791
If that's the case, I also know...

621
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:25,003
Could it be, have you seen it?

622
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,130
I'm not coming back?

623
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:29,090
That's why we are looking for you.

624
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:32,177
What happened?

625
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:33,678
1 don't know!

626
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:37,182
When the wedding started, you were gone!

627
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:38,516
Then the wedding?

628
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:41,144
I replaced you.

629
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:43,563
But in the middle I also ran away.

630
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:45,732
The marriage must have gone awry.

631
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:48,568
What are you doing?

632
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:49,736
But why?

633
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:52,238
Suddenly I didn't feel confident, you know.

634
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:56,117
So sad?

635
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:59,996
Didn't you come back
because of an accident?

636
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:05,168
Then what, then?

637
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,631
What kind of accident?!

638
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:25,521
Can't you forget Nobita?

639
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:31,110
I don't know why he disappeared suddenly.

640
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,404
Even though he said he liked me.

641
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:38,576
Seriously, Nobita. If I find
him, I'll beat him black and blue.

642
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:43,122
But I believe, Nobita
will definitely come back.

643
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:48,962
And when he comes back, he'll
tell me everything. I believe it.

644
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:57,679
I'm sorry, Shizuka! But
understand! I'm doing this for you too!

645
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,807
Take out your courage and come back.

646
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:04,435
I can not. If time has
passed any minute,...

647
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:10,608
...surely Shizuka would forget
me and meet another man.

648
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:15,405
If she forgets me, she can be happy.

649
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:18,950
Then, do you want to
see Shizuka's future again?

650
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:28,626
No. I don't want to see
Shizuka happy with another man!

651
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,920
How selfish.

652
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:37,927
But if she turns out to be unhappy,
I don't want to look anymore!

653
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,804
How troublesome this guy is.

654
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,515
He's you after all.

655
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,475
Come to think of it, this is
all because you are usually

656
00:51:46,487 --> 00:51:49,897
just taking naps, which
is why I became like this.

657
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:53,818
Homework is not even
done, and tests can be 0 only.

658
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,486
Have no confidence anymore.

659
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,822
Don't blame me, please!

660
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,908
Don't fight with yourself!

661
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:07,081
Ah, if I could go back to this
time, maybe I could fix things up.

662
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,125
If you want, it's easy, really.

663
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,088
"Soul Swapping Ropes"!

664
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:19,385
If you hold this rope,
you can change bodies.

665
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:32,899
Why are you so excited?
It's Dangerous, you know.

666
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:37,070
Besides, when are you coming
back? Just now you still weren't around.

667
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:41,032
Now, how happy. This feeling and that...

668
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:43,159
No, nothing.

669
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:44,619
I'll play first, OK!

670
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,287
Ah, Nobita, the shopping...

671
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,125
It was out suddenly.

672
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:02,220
Wow, Gian and the others are still kids.

673
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:04,889
Of course, hahaha.

674
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,684
Hey, how are you?

675
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:10,228
What are you doing, Nobita? Very arrogant.

676
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:13,189
Even though you are Nobita,
you really don't hesitate!

677
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,941
I also want to play, please.

678
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:19,529
Oh, it's the first time you
asked to enter yourself.

679
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,863
Okay, let's try it.

680
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:24,242
You want to play baseball yourself.

681
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:27,954
He must have been training hard and finally
become an expert at playing baseball.

682
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,336
Catch it fast!

683
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:39,590
Nobita, you understand, right?

684
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:45,138
Batter, out!

685
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:56,149
Even though he is an adult,
he still hasn't changed at all.

686
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,984
That's right, yes.

687
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:07,034
Nobita! What does this mean?

688
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:13,082
You asked yourself to come
in, why did it turn out like this?

689
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,918
Oh right, you're angry.
Of course you get angry.

690
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:19,130
What did you say?

691
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:22,717
We lost because of you, you know!

692
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:26,763
His sense of power
simply couldn't stand it.

693
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:29,015
Damn it!

694
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:30,767
No kidding!

695
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,645
This is it! This feeling!

696
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:39,400
He looks so happy. Adults
just can't be understood.

697
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:46,657
Well, if he's tired, he can
also go home by himself.

698
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:53,164
Nobita, with a body like that,
we better enter from the window.

699
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:55,750
Yes, that’s right.

700
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:10,306
Hey, finally you guys came
home. Where have you been?

701
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:11,599
Who are you?

702
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:17,897
Oh, sorry. I'm from the future
department store. My name is Nakameguro.

703
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:21,817
Oh, those of you who
like to give us samples.

704
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,444
Why are you here today?

705
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:29,992
Um, about the soul-swaping
rope I sent here...

706
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,828
I want to take it back.

707
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:34,580
Hah? Is there any problem?

708
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,082
Of course not!

709
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:40,545
That's the gadgets that we choose
carefully from the shop right away...

710
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:43,089
How could there be a problem...

711
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,093
Then why?

712
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:50,721
Um, that... about that..

713
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:53,933
Don’t worry. We'll
definitely return it, really.

714
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:56,477
Oh, thank you very much!

715
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:58,604
But wait a minute, okay.

716
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:03,025
We just used the rope for Nobita. If they
have exchanged it back, we will return it.

717
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,361
I'm actually a kid.

718
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,406
So what?

719
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:12,493
H-H-H-How long has it been
since you guys used that rope?

720
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,454
Hmm... how many minutes has it been?

721
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:19,292
Almost 1 hour, right?

722
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,752
W-W-W-W-W-W-W-What!

723
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:22,461
Hah?

724
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,547
This is bad!

725
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:27,091
Listen carefully.

726
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:32,513
Actually, the gadget has
a slight error in its design...

727
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:38,102
After 1 hour, their
consciousness will disappear?

728
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:40,646
And the memories of both of us...

729
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,814
If you don't quickly
return to your original

730
00:56:43,826 --> 00:56:46,652
self, the memories
will be lost forever.

731
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:47,862
Nobita!

732
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:49,030
Come on, quickly!

733
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,535
W-Where are .you going?

734
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:57,163
First of all we ask this gadget.

735
00:56:57,205 --> 00:57:00,207
Where is the adult Nobita?

736
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,672
Why can't it?

737
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:10,343
What can I do, we just
search from here first.

738
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:17,308
Why? What is wrong?

739
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:21,729
Could it be... Nobita who has grown
up was not returning to the future..

740
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:23,940
Because he couldn't
go back to the future.,

741
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:25,441
What do you mean?

742
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:29,528
If he has lost his memory,
he doesn't know himself, right?

743
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:37,078
Then, my memories in this
era will also be lost, right?

744
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:41,082
It's a shame, but there you have it.

745
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:44,377
I don't want that!

746
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:46,796
Nobita, wait a minute!

747
00:57:56,306 --> 00:58:01,185
Finally I am free from them,
and Suneo are so stubborn.

748
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,895
Excuse me.

749
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:08,067
Hey. Excuse me, you said?

750
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:12,780
Why are you angry?
It was just a little hit.

751
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:18,327
What's with this kid?
Why are you so arrogant?

752
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,871
Stop it, all of you.

753
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,418
He told us to stop...

754
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,671
You don't know, do you?

755
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:35,386
Oye, don't you have any
sense of apologies at all?

756
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:36,512
Y-yes.

757
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:41,225
What? Do you know what
usually happens at times like this?

758
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,601
N-No.

759
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:47,356
Don't know? Then I'll tell you.

760
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,400
Listen carefully, you know.

761
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:55,197
What about compensation money?

762
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:58,117
Compensation? How much?

763
00:58:58,118 --> 00:58:59,827
Yes, 1000 yen.

764
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:04,165
Wait, because you are
arrogant, how about 2000 yen?

765
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:11,047
But this is not coercion, you
know. This is just a suggestion.

766
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:15,593
Hahaha, you junior high school student.

767
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:19,305
If that's all I can pay happily.

768
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:24,185
I always carry paper
money for times like this.

769
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,437
Take this.

770
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:32,067
Hah? Why is this money
has picture of Osamu Tezuka?

771
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:35,946
Alas, this is money from the future.

772
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:38,157
Did you take this money
from the children's bank?

773
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:41,452
Oye, don't mess around. Bring
out the real thing! Take it out!

774
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:43,996
Come on, get out the real money!

775
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:56,675
I can drive this vehicle, you know,
because I'm actually an adult.

776
00:59:58,178 --> 00:59:59,929
Go, scooter!

777
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,518
Okay, scooter!

778
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:06,894
Hey, scooter!

779
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:14,610
In this era there is no
control of the sound, huh?

780
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:20,282
Then, how about we start the punishment?

781
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,575
Stupid brat...

782
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:31,085
My scooter!

783
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:33,504
Forgive me!

784
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:35,256
Dammit.

785
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,426
Hah?

786
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:57,444
Excuse me!

787
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:14,503
Forgive me!

788
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:27,266
Shizuka?

789
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:48,037
Hey, you...

790
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,628
Yes, you are interesting too.

791
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:04,511
Wait a minute. Come to think
of it, this is your fault, right?

792
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:10,392
You're just junior high school kids.
You can't do like this.

793
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:13,771
How can you threaten
adult who is older than you.

794
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:18,859
How could you be...

795
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:28,118
How could you avoid it!

796
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:31,038
Eh? Why just now?

797
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:36,293
How dare you. I can't forgive!

798
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,171
Take this!

799
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:45,678
It hurts... It's scary...

800
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:50,724
Geez.
Where is the adult Nobita?

801
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,895
Nobita!

802
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:07,199
Nobita!

803
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:09,952
Nobita!

804
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:25,759
It's very dangerous. Let's go down first.

805
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:31,598
Nobita, are you okay?

806
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:37,730
Who are you?

807
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:42,109
It's me, Doraemon! Just hold on!

808
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:48,991
That is true. I'm just stunned a little...

809
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:51,201
Your consciousness starts to
lose little by little! Nobita, hang on!

810
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:53,495
Hang in there, Nobita!

811
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:57,207
Don’t worry.

812
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,755
I will definitely restore
my future with Shizuka.

813
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:04,715
Nobita...

814
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:11,889
We don't have time. Come on, quickly!

815
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:15,392
You guys calm down, please.

816
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:19,897
It's your nature that makes us nervous!

817
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:22,024
Stop bothering weak people.

818
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:26,278
Who are you?

819
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:29,406
The kids in this town are all so arrogant.

820
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:33,911
If you don't step aside
it can be dangerous.

821
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:35,746
Shizuka, run away!

822
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:47,257
Why?

823
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:49,510
Get away from Shizuka!

824
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:51,011
Nobita!

825
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,099
You are!

826
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:00,813
Hah? Again, again...

827
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:03,816
My head is dizzy...

828
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:05,901
It felt like he was so hard to hit!

829
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:09,029
That's not the case...

830
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:11,198
You can't run away!

831
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:15,411
Gian?

832
01:05:16,121 --> 01:05:19,581
So you ran off here, didn't you, Nobita?

833
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,375
You!

834
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:35,556
If this toy is damaged, you
have to compensate, you know.

835
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:37,057
Suneo!

836
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:40,519
Who are you?

837
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:47,943
The only ones allowed to
beat Nobita are us, you know!

838
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:57,828
Just remember, yes!

839
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,128
You're great too, Nobita.

840
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:11,842
You are so sloppy, huh.
Even though you can't fight.

841
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:17,347
Did 1 protect Shizuka?

842
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,019
Hooray!

843
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:31,320
Nobita? Why? Just hold on!

844
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:33,906
Nobita got on a scooter earlier and fell.

845
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:34,698
What?

846
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:36,491
Maybe he hit his head.

847
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:41,497
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad!

848
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:45,209
Hang in there, Nobita!

849
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:47,920
Don’t worry.

850
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:52,090
We will surely find my adult myself.

851
01:06:52,091 --> 01:07:00,098
I will protect my future with Shizuka...

852
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:02,976
Nobita! Ah, Nobita!

853
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:07,481
How about this? At this rate,
Nobita will lose his memory!

854
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:09,900
Where is the adult Nobita? Damnit!

855
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:16,990
How about this? Is there
no gadget that can be used?

856
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:18,158
Oh yes! There is this!

857
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:22,120
Go to where adult Nobita is!

858
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:29,336
He's not an adult Nobita currently...

859
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:35,592
Ah, what should I do? What should I do?

860
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:38,011
Wait a minute.

861
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:41,556
If I say more carefully, will it work?

862
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:47,396
Go to little Nobita's place
where there is an adult Nobita!

863
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:57,990
Nobita! Nobita!

864
01:07:57,991 --> 01:08:00,284
Oye, hang on, Nobita!

865
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:02,744
We've called an ambulance!

866
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:04,997
Hooray, it worked!

867
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:10,836
Who is it?

868
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:14,590
Do not ask.
Just put this rope on that Nobita.

869
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:15,591
Okay!

870
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,137
He can't go back.

871
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,057
What happened?

872
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:27,686
Just try it first!
Don't say you can't!

873
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:30,314
But the mechanism was set up like this...

874
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:35,568
I said try it first! If Nobita doesn't
come back, I'll crush you to pieces!

875
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:37,070
Even if you say so...

876
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:42,034
Do not give up!
If we don't try it, we won't know, right?

877
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:45,829
A-Alright. Geez, using the
rope is very rough, though.

878
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:52,919
See. The time has been
too long, so he can't go back.

879
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:53,920
Shut up!

880
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:56,214
Hold on...

881
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:02,345
I can't do it...

882
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:04,931
What happened?

883
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:08,309
Nobita, do you want this?

884
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:12,898
Your memories of Gian, Suneo,
and Shizuka will be lost, you know.

885
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:15,192
Really? You're kidding, right?

886
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:16,360
You're kidding, right?

887
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:21,740
Nobita, you will forget me too.

888
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:24,660
Do you want that?

889
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:41,760
I do not want!

890
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:02,447
Oh, It's moving!

891
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:05,409
We made it in time.

892
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:07,994
Nobita!

893
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:49,453
Nobita! Nobita!

894
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,040
Shizuka?

895
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:59,629
Geez! Nobita, you idiot!

896
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:03,133
Why are you fighting,
even though you can't?

897
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:05,218
Don't force it.

898
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:08,638
Let it be what you are!

899
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:25,113
Are you alright?

900
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:29,284
Yes. I think I can go home.

901
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,912
Yes. Looks like I've been able
to go back to my Shizuka's place.

902
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:41,046
But before returning to the future,
there is one place I want to visit.

903
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:46,676
Because I have to make a
speech at the wedding, right?

904
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:47,969
Could it be, you want to go to...

905
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,554
Yes, our

906
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:51,014
Yes, our birthday!

907
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:56,895
That's right. I also want to make sure that
I really am the child of this family,...

908
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:59,481
...and why they gave me the name Nobita.

909
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:01,441
I also want to know.

910
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:05,821
Okay, okay. It's been this
far, I just follow your wishes.

911
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:19,543
Wow, this was my house 10 years ago!

912
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:24,130
At that time, this room
was still Father's room.

913
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:27,050
Looks like we've stolen her hobby room.

914
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:30,428
There are no blisters on the pillars yet.

915
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:33,306
But there's nobody here.

916
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:36,768
If my parents are not here, how am I born?

917
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:40,272
Could it be that you are
really an adopted child?

918
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:43,233
See. That is right!

919
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:46,027
Calm down, they must be in the hospital.

920
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:48,321
Where is she? Where is she?

921
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:51,575
Oh, Dad! 10 years younger!

922
01:12:51,576 --> 01:12:54,327
From my point of view,
he's 25 years younger!

923
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:57,455
Still like a young man.

924
01:12:57,456 --> 01:13:00,250
Who are you?

925
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:02,627
You forgot your own son!

926
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:06,214
Do not say like that!
You weren't born here!

927
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:10,719
Excuse me, it looks like
we are at the wrong house.

928
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,015
What is that?

929
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:19,227
Instead of thinking about
that, where is the baby, huh?

930
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:22,898
Even though I was home early from work.

931
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:27,485
Ah, where? Where? Here, huh?

932
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:31,114
Isn't he at the hospital?

933
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:32,907
Oh yes! That is true!

934
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:37,412
In such a hurry.

935
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:40,749
By the way, where is the hospital?

936
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:44,419
Wait a minute! We're coming too!

937
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:52,844
Congratulations, sir! Your son is born.

938
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,638
Oh, thanks for the food!

939
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:57,140
No, I mean... thank you.

940
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:58,308
Come here.

941
01:13:58,309 --> 01:14:01,686
Huh, I'm so excited.

942
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:06,066
I'm excited too.
What type of baby that be?

943
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:09,653
Must be a cute kid like us.

944
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:13,782
Hahaha, it's better not
to get your hopes up.

945
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:16,743
Tama-Chan!

946
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:22,791
Hello, this is Dad, son!

947
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:27,796
How cute he's. This is my son, right?

948
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:30,298
Hello, my baby!

949
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:33,134
1 want to see too!

950
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:35,553
Is this me?

951
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:38,515
Why are there wrinkles like
this? Looks like a monkey!

952
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:42,268
What do you mean monkey, huh?

953
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:48,024
That was shocking. Don't be that angry too.

954
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:50,276
He's mad because you
weren't being polite, right?

955
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:53,571
After all, isn't baby Nobita cute?

956
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:59,119
No! Not cute at all!
Surely that baby is not me!

957
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:02,080
Newborn babies are like that, you know.

958
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:04,416
Who are those kids?

959
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:06,835
They've been following me from earlier.

960
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:09,629
I wonder what their parents look like.

961
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:14,384
Where's my mom, by the way?
She should be with you, right?

962
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:17,721
Oh, she said she wanted
to tell our ancestors.

963
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:19,514
She must be very happy, huh?

964
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:23,393
Yes, she couldn't stop crying.

965
01:15:24,395 --> 01:15:26,229
This bear?

966
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,606
Mother's gift for this child.

967
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:31,609
Too fast, right?

968
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:41,286
By the way, what about this child's name?

969
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:43,371
I thought about it carefully.

970
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:45,457
What is that?

971
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:48,752
Tadaaa, I'm telling you, yes.

972
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:51,004
Nobita Nobi!

973
01:15:52,006 --> 01:15:53,715
Nobita?

974
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:55,341
Nice name, right?

975
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:58,803
I want a cooler name.

976
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:01,181
They should listen to our hopes, please.

977
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:04,142
Stop it, stop it. You'll be
scolded again, you know!

978
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:07,520
The meaning of the
name? Of course there is!

979
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:13,610
I want this child to
grow up healthy always.

980
01:16:13,611 --> 01:16:15,653
What a nice name.

981
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,323
Nobita Nobi.

982
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:22,410
I like that name.

983
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:26,998
So they thought about the name carefully.

984
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:33,213
I want to raise him to be a good boy.

985
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:36,925
He must be a good boy!

986
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:40,929
If he looks like you,
he will be doing well.

987
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:45,433
If he looks like you, he
will be good at sports.

988
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:46,309
Truly.

989
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:49,521
You only looks alike in the
weak spots of your parents.

990
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,105
What a chatterbox, ah!

991
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:56,319
Is he going to be a professor?
Or a baseball player?

992
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,862
He can be a painter too.

993
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:02,242
Painter, sculptor, musician.

994
01:17:02,243 --> 01:17:03,576
Anything is okay.

995
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:06,830
As long as he is of
use to those around him.

996
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:09,833
Care for others and be brave.

997
01:17:09,834 --> 01:17:14,629
A cheerful child, a real boy,
strong, fair, and handsome.

998
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:20,885
Um, don't get your hopes up, anyway.

999
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:23,555
He's not that great kid, really.

1000
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:28,393
From earlier you kept bothering me.
Do you have a grudge against my son?!

1001
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,734
Father and mother

1002
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:38,695
They are very happy.

1003
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:41,614
They are full of hope.

1004
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,998
Let's go back to the future.

1005
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:08,016
Finally we are back.

1006
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:16,316
Oh, come here.

1007
01:18:16,317 --> 01:18:17,066
What? What?

1008
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:18,067
Why?

1009
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,112
Look at that.

1010
01:18:22,156 --> 01:18:27,118
In a place like that, greeting
means thanking your parents.

1011
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:33,207
Be thankful? They always get
mad when I get 0 points! I can not!

1012
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:36,419
You're still thinking about it.

1013
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,671
To run like that...

1014
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,217
Come on, quickly.

1015
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:48,806
Um... sorry, yeah. But can you go alone?

1016
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:53,811
We still have important
promise that we must keep.

1017
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:55,521
Right, Doraemon?

1018
01:18:56,690 --> 01:19:00,902
Oh, I see?
If so, this is goodbye.

1019
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,867
Thank you for finding me.

1020
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:09,827
Thank you for finding me.:

1021
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:13,748
Your future is mine too.:

1022
01:19:13,832 --> 01:19:17,293
Oh yes! This.

1023
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:22,590
This...

1024
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:25,426
See you later, yes!

1025
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:31,599
By the way, what is that important promise?

1026
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:53,329
Thanks for waiting!

1027
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:58,710
Thank you!

1028
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:06,801
Everyone, my healthy
friend, Nobita, is back!

1029
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:09,971
Thank goodness, we survived.

1030
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:11,556
Thank you, Nobita!

1031
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:14,684
Really grateful!

1032
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:17,311
But it took him a long time to come back.

1033
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:20,982
I've bought time for you, you know.

1034
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:35,705
Welcome back.

1035
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:39,292
I am back.
You must be worried, right?

1036
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:40,835
Not really.

1037
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:43,629
Not at all.

1038
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:51,471
Then, let us hear the Greeting
remarks from our groom once again.

1039
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:53,931
The rain has stopped.

1040
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:13,367
Everyone, good afternoon. I am Nobita Nobi.

1041
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:15,161
We know already!

1042
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:20,875
At first, I didn't like this name.

1043
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:23,669
Because it seems slow and stupid.

1044
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:30,029
But when I was born, my
parents gave me this name

1045
01:21:30,041 --> 01:21:35,306
in the hope that I will
continue to grow.healthily.

1046
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:38,893
Now, I really like this name.

1047
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:41,938
It's like he was there and saw
everything that was going on, huh?

1048
01:21:42,773 --> 01:21:46,150
I was raised by my
parents and my grandma...

1049
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:51,114
And also my grandma, they
took care of me with great love.

1050
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:57,703
When I was a kid and came home
crying, Grandma always comforted me.

1051
01:21:58,288 --> 01:22:03,584
And Grandma always believed what I said.

1052
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:10,425
When I got zero points,
Mom always scolded me.

1053
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:15,513
And Father taught me
to try to reach my dreams.

1054
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:22,687
I grew up with your love.

1055
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:25,565
And Shizuka's father...

1056
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:32,947
You once said that I am a person who
understands the pain of other people.

1057
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:38,911
It's because my family taught me that.

1058
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:46,460
Maybe I did not become the child my
parents and grandma expected me to be.

1059
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:55,845
Maybe they expected me to
become a painter or a baseball player.

1060
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:57,847
Wow, their hopes all failed!

1061
01:22:58,348 --> 01:22:59,891
You're so loud!

1062
01:23:03,729 --> 01:23:07,523
But I can say this one thing.

1063
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:11,986
I've been raised by a wonderful family.

1064
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:16,491
Because of that, even
though it can't be expected,

1065
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:20,995
.. I want to make a
warm family with Shizuka.

1066
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:25,541
In this regard, I am very confident.

1067
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:35,218
If I do that, I feel I have returned the
services of my parents and grandma.

1068
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:39,013
Mother, father.

1069
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:42,016
Shizuka's Father and Mother.

1070
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:45,019
We will follow in your footsteps;

1071
01:23:46,313 --> 01:23:47,605
Shizuka.

1072
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:53,569
Let's make a happy family like them.

1073
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:45,955
What is wrong?

1074
01:24:48,959 --> 01:24:51,961
No, nothing.

1075
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,731
Are you going home already?

1076
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:17,111
Grandma has seen enough.

1077
01:25:29,416 --> 01:25:33,628
Looks like Mom was here just now.

1078
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:35,129
Oh, you feel so too?

1079
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:40,885
It's -possible that Mom actually came here.

1080
01:26:00,781 --> 01:26:01,822
Nobita.

1081
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:04,909
Your earlier was fake, right?

1082
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:09,538
That... er...

1083
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:12,917
Even though you are better off just you.

1084
01:26:12,918 --> 01:26:16,420
You always hide your own sadness...

1085
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:22,134
But in the end, you must be
helped by Doraemon again, right?

1086
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:32,061
I came back for the sake of my happiness.

1087
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:37,108
With that, Shizuka must also be happy.

1088
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:41,320
Very good!

1089
01:26:44,241 --> 01:26:46,325
Oh yes. This.

1090
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:52,081
I want to start all over again.

1091
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:46,719
OK, we're going home?

1092
01:27:47,596 --> 01:27:48,596
Nobita,

1093
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:53,559
You really did fulfill Grandma's dream.

1094
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:56,395
Thank you.

1095
01:27:57,147 --> 01:28:02,026
You're welcome. I'm also grateful for being
able to keep my promise to my grandmother.

1096
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:07,031
Yes. Grandma is really very happy.

1097
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:09,408
But...

1098
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:11,160
But...

1099
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:17,208
In order to keep Grandma's promise...

1100
01:28:18,627 --> 01:28:29,929
You must have suffered a lot
just to keep Grandma's promise.

1101
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:34,934
That whiny little Nobita...

1102
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:39,814
To end up being a good boy like this.

1103
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:49,114
That's what made Grandma the happiest.

1104
01:28:50,367 --> 01:28:51,534
Grandma!

1105
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:54,828
I'm not like that.

1106
01:28:56,081 --> 01:28:59,500
I'm a stupid coward,

1107
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:01,460
also a crybaby...

1108
01:29:02,629 --> 01:29:08,926
But Nobita has real strength, right?

1109
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:18,978
Shizuka must know that too,
that's why she became your bride.

1110
01:29:18,979 --> 01:29:21,105
Grandma!

1111
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:28,237
Oh, oh, you're back to
being little Nobita again.

1112
01:29:30,991 --> 01:29:33,284
Can I come again?

1113
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:38,581
You can come no matter how many times.

1114
01:29:38,582 --> 01:29:43,335
Grandma will be waiting for you here.

1115
01:30:03,148 --> 01:30:06,901
So the time machine can drive itself, huh?

1116
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:10,988
Yes. I'm tired of driving today.

1117
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:16,785
So many things happened.
It's you, really.

1118
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:20,122
Hehehe. Sorry, yes, Doraemon.

1119
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:22,249
Are you really sorry?

1120
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:23,876
Of course! It's true!

1121
01:30:23,918 --> 01:30:26,045
Really?

1122
01:30:29,382 --> 01:30:31,675
How stubborn, huh!

1123
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:38,182
Oh, damn it! Forgetful Stick!

1124
01:30:38,183 --> 01:30:43,103
This is bad! Nobita forgot his memory.

1125
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:45,481
This is really bad, right?

1126
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:48,400
But wait!

1127
01:30:49,194 --> 01:30:54,198
Nobita, Nobita, Nobita...

1128
01:30:58,536 --> 01:31:03,916
Doraemon?
Why am I riding a time machine?

1129
01:31:03,917 --> 01:31:07,033
You see, we have just
experienced something very

1130
01:31:07,045 --> 01:31:10,172
troublesome, but also
something very beautiful.-

1131
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:12,841
Eh? What is that? What
is that? Please, tell me!

1132
01:31:12,884 --> 01:31:15,094
When you grow up, you will know.

1133
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:16,970
Until then, it's better if you don't Know.

1134
01:31:17,138 --> 01:31:20,641
Why is that? What happened?

1135
01:31:20,642 --> 01:31:22,893
How much do you remember?

1136
01:31:22,894 --> 01:31:27,147
Hmm, we met Grandma...

1137
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:30,609
Oh yes! We have to show
my .bride to Grandma!

1138
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:33,237
Take it easy. Everything is finished.

1139
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:38,242
Eh? What does it mean? Tell me please!

1140
01:31:38,284 --> 01:31:41,870
How stubborn, huh! I won't tell!

1141
01:31:41,871 --> 01:31:45,040
