1
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,520
2011 cricket world cup finals
that took place in Mumbai

2
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,440
has been changed to Chennai
accommodating the story

3
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,560
Coz, we don't have huge
budgets like Bollywood.

4
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,600
Please adjust!

5
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,520
"Victory is ours when friendship
is our pillar of strength!"

6
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:38,240
'Show Stealers With a Plan'

7
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,080
This movie is just an entertainment.

8
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,760
We don't support or justify the act
of stealing or robbing in any manner.

9
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,520
So...

10
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,920
We kindly request you not to indulge
in act of stealing or robbery...

11
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,920
because that's what
we are here for.

12
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,320
All together, this movie has...

13
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,120
No logic, only...

14
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,120
MAGIC

15
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,160
Team India that won the recently concluded
cricket world cup at Chepauk in Chennai...

16
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,960
and it is been speculated that
instead of the original cup, India

17
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,760
has been awarded, what they call
the replica of the world cup.

18
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,760
Over the years different teams
have won the world cup trophy.

19
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,240
After 1983, 28 years later...

20
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,000
The Indian team won the
world cup again in 2011.

21
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:05,200
You all are aware of how India and Sri
Lanka strived hard to win the cup.

22
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,480
But there's one thing
you all are unaware of.

23
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,760
In order to 'lift' the
same world cup trophy...

24
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,360
an useless team was on the hunt

25
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,920
Who are those useless fellows?

26
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,600
and what are these
stooges upto?

27
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,360
That's what this
ride is all about.

28
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,800
"Brave and brisk robbers; that's them!"

29
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,960
"So fierce and witty; that's them!"

30
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,880
"So fast and furious; yes, that's them!"

31
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,000
"Neither they leave any trails
nor can they be traced."

32
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,520
"Here comes THE
Show Stealers with a plan!"

33
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,560
Shiva. He'll die for computers.
Hacking is his passion

34
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,960
This skill is all need to show off at
the Engineering college he studied

35
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,320
I challenge you to
hack the question paper.

36
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,480
Come on, Shiva! Don't screw this up.

37
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,440
Quick buddy, soon
you'll run out of time.

38
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,600
Yes! It's our question paper indeed!

39
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,240
He didn't stop there, he continued to exhibit
his hacking skills at the I.T company he worked

40
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,440
Check it out

41
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,360
Shankar...

42
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,560
Yes, Shiva?

43
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,720
I have loaded this hard disk with the client details
and personal details of our competitive companies.

44
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,120
What's the guarantee that you won't hack
the sensitive details of our company?

45
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,480
- Shankar!
- I'm so sorry, Shiva.

46
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,440
We are terminating you from
the job for being unethical.

47
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,200
So you'll also be blacklisted from
joining any other software company.

48
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,320
So get along and let's plan.

49
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,240
Carefully, let's make the moves.

50
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,920
Don't worry, the
treasure is ours.

51
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,280
Here's your share, now
get in the groove!

52
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,560
Don't let the fear crawl in.
So beat the fear and get going!

53
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,600
This is a miracle!

54
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,120
You bet, Anjali!

55
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,520
- The money?
- Its ready!

56
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,880
Anjali

57
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,560
Only daughter of Mr. Raghuvaran,

58
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,480
For many years her dad had
been the pioneer in supplying

59
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,400
antiques and rare collection
item to big shots

60
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,600
And she is steps ahead of father

61
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,360
If you love your job...

62
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,960
then no matter how illegal it
is, you will still be blinded.

63
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,440
I love this profession.

64
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,440
Here comes THE Show
Stealers with a plan!

65
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,200
Collecting kickbacks and
eating free food from the

66
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,560
fast food van joints; is
the part time job of...

67
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,120
Constable Padmanaban aka Buddy

68
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,040
Shiva's favorite fast food joint is where
he met Buddy and became friends with him

69
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,480
He loves his mother tongue, Tamizh
a lot and speaks only in Tamizh.

70
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,440
Please don't ask why. That's how it is.

71
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,880
You can't just pick
locks using any pin.

72
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,920
Everyone cannot be an expert in handling
the tools for picking a lock.

73
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,720
It's an art!

74
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,000
Robbery resides where
corruption rules.

75
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,320
We plan and steal;
we aren't no fools.

76
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,400
We are the robbers
with a plan.

77
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,920
Watch us at work and we
will make you our fan!

78
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,240
Hacking, lock picking;
we are the pros!

79
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,400
Do it with a style!
That's our goal!

80
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,320
The great poet, Bharathiyar!

81
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,400
After becoming Buddy's bunny in Bureau pulling
case, he became close friends with him.

82
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,480
That's 'Kambi' Gaja.

83
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,080
You must always have a plan.

84
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,120
Whether the plan
pays off or not...

85
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,040
We must always...

86
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,880
dictate ourselves to stay dedicated!

87
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,920
Especially, when it comes to women, we
must be dedicate ourselves to be dictated!

88
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,360
Sethu...

89
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,200
Selling Antiques
is his profession.

90
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,840
He owns a shop - 'Sethu Antiques'

91
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,960
Legal antiques are
sold inside the shop

92
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,320
Illegal antiques are stashed and
dealt in the basement of the shop

93
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,400
Anjali helps the selling illegal
antiques stolen by Sethu.

94
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,120
Shiva is Sethu's nephew.

95
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,720
Neither loves nor respects his uncle

96
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,840
So fierce and witty; that's them!

97
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,880
They are so cool and swag!

98
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,800
Here comes THE Show
Stealers with a plan!

99
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,200
Nizam museum.

100
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,400
Hyderabad.

101
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,640
This is our first operation.

102
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,120
There is a unused rear
gate in the museum.

103
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,280
So let's leave our valor
in our wallets and...

104
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,200
attack from the back
side of the museum.

105
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,040
The museum's got 24
hours tight security.

106
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,160
If we get caught...

107
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,480
we will be minced.

108
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,800
There is a restricted
room at down stairs.

109
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,520
We are going to rob everything that's
available in the restricted room.

110
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,760
So this is the lock?

111
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,360
This is the photo of the lock.
The lock is over there.

112
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,800
Don't expect me to
laugh for this joke!

113
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,760
Already looks like it has
been picked many times.

114
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,640
Its ok.

115
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,800
Trust 'Kambi' (rod) Gaja and
I(t) won't disappoint you.

116
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,520
We better escape,
that's our cue!

117
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,160
These are the CCTV
installed there.

118
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,680
Huh! LE-I7.

119
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,640
Its the outdated VGA model.
No night vision.

120
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,480
And range is just a
mere seven meters.

121
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,400
It's a walk in the park, uncle!

122
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,880
Yet, we will wear a mask
because that's safe for us.

123
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,880
When's the operation?

124
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,360
On Friday.

125
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,760
Awesome chief! May the
lady luck smile at you.

126
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,440
'Lady' luck?

127
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,240
Will she date me?

128
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,560
Duh! We are an excellent group!

129
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,720
- Come on.
- Whoa! It's a mammoth gate!

130
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,360
Looks like it was
locked ages ago!

131
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,680
What are they up to?

132
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:54,880
Shiva...

133
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,760
what's with the ropes?

134
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,840
Watch out, don't leave
us stranded halfway!

135
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,240
Careful Shiva!

136
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,120
You are the main guy in the group.
Careful!

137
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,560
He climbs like a Komodo! Wow!

138
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,600
Ok, now throw this to him.

139
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,440
Buddy, catch!

140
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,680
Ouch!

141
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,000
The Black rope for us
to climb and get down

142
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,440
And the white one
for the idols

143
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,240
Quite confusing

144
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,360
See you darling!

145
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,560
Here's one.

146
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,560
Take that!

147
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,640
Here goes the hook that will hold
on to the weight of the idols

148
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,960
Don't use the white rope.

149
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,800
Use the black rope to climb.

150
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,920
You get in!

151
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,680
- Where's the bag?
- So many idols!

152
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,520
This one's for me. Here, pack it!

153
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,440
Look what he is doing! Doofus!

154
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,520
Why would you do that?

155
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,960
- I was signaling.
- Shut up!

156
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,920
Shut up or I'll
stuff your mouth!

157
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,320
Make it fast! Throw the bag.

158
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,680
R-E-S-T ROOM...

159
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,120
Didn't chief say
'Restricted Room?'

160
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,320
I get it. Must be a short form because
the board ain't that lengthy.

161
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,400
Here's your countdown
to pick the lock!

162
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,320
Ten.

163
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,360
Nine.

164
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,560
- Eight! Whoa! Super!
- Don't you underestimate 'Kambi' Gaja!

165
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,120
Why is this one
alone wrapped up?

166
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,800
Could it be to prevent
it from the rain?

167
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,000
Come here...

168
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,160
Let's check it out.

169
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,960
Whoa! Something's
written in Telugu.

170
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,160
So this is Telugu?
Nice to meet you.

171
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,840
In School I learnt
Hindi not Telugu

172
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,120
Could it have been a wedding invitation
for the King? Why weren't we invited?

173
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,520
Why does his face look
like the Apple logo?

174
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,400
- Why is the ambulance here?
- It's the security alarm!

175
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,640
Alarm? But alarms are suppose
to ring in the morning!

176
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,600
Wait for me! I am coming!

177
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,600
Open it! Who's that?

178
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,360
Uh-oh! Danger alert!

179
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,680
Err...Black rope...White
one...Uh-oh!

180
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,320
Chief, as usual we messed it up!
Run before we get caught...

181
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,800
Make it fast! Give me the bag...

182
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
- Who's that?
- Run! Run!

183
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,840
- Catch him!
- Run! Go!

184
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,080
Shiva! Save me! Shiva!

185
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,520
Let go of me. Please!

186
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,200
Leave that. Hold this.

187
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,920
Hold it!

188
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,160
- Slow! Watch out!
- Lets leave him here.

189
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,800
Press the emergency button!

190
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,000
Custom officials are
irritating man!

191
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,240
Let me just get back to Dubai.
I'll sort it with the ICB.

192
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,480
Looks like he is a flirt.

193
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,600
Pakistan progress to the
semis by defeating the

194
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,360
West Indies by 10 wickets
in the 1st quarter final.

195
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,080
Uncle...

196
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,880
where did he go?

197
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,920
- Hey! This is still unsold?
- No one's gonna buy that.

198
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,280
Hey, take out the stuff we robbed
from the Andhra museum.

199
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,160
- Let them come and click photos.
- Ok.

200
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,360
What statue is this?

201
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,920
Chief, it's hard to find buyers
for these kind of paintings.

202
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,520
Listen you pony tail! Don't beat around the
bush. Ask if you want extra commission.

203
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,160
Anjali, kindly adjust this time.

204
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,560
We shall pay you a
hefty sum next time.

205
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,640
You keep saying this every time.
We'll see.

206
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,800
- Take your seat.
- Yes sir.

207
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,680
He is George.

208
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,640
He is in charge of this case.

209
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
Nice meeting you sir.

210
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,720
Please hand over all the
details regarding this case.

211
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,840
See this. Something important.

212
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,400
Neither the public nor the
media know about it.

213
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,480
In fact, only a few important
officials in the government...

214
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,160
and higher officials in Archeology
department knows about this.

215
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,800
This is a photo of the painting that was
recovered during the excavation in 1978.

216
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,000
This is King Nizam who ruled
this place 120 years ago.

217
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,160
You can see in the photo that he is
kneeling down in front of British queen.

218
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,400
If this photo leaks...

219
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,840
then people who see him as a brave
warrior and a successful king...

220
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,600
will make an big issue out of it.

221
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Not just that. Check this.

222
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,760
The king was mesmerized by
the queen's beauty and...

223
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,520
he gifted her a gold mine.

224
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,920
But that gold mine mentioned in this...

225
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,200
is untraceable in
the present day.

226
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,880
If any information about this mine leaks...

227
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,400
it might stir up
unnecessary controversies.

228
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,120
Without anybody's
knowledge, this painting...

229
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,560
was hid here by the government under the
law section "Official secret acts of 1923"

230
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,880
Unfortunately, while the
museum got robbed...

231
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,920
this painting too was robbed

232
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,120
And one more thing.

233
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,600
The king, the crown and
the queen shown in the

234
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,200
original picture are painted
using real melted gold.

235
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,200
The painting is worth millions as of today.

236
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:52,960
Who knows...

237
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,960
the robbers could have
targeted this picture mainly.

238
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,640
- But the media...
- Doesn't know it yet.

239
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,160
There is a restricted
room in that museum.

240
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,080
Sugumar has the CCTV footage of that room.
Collect it from him.

241
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,320
The painting was
stolen from that room.

242
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,240
Ok sir.

243
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,560
Sripurandhan is a
village in Ariyalur.

244
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,880
This idol was found in a
temple in that village.

245
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,360
When Mohammed Ghajini
invaded, this idol exchanged

246
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,680
hands many times and finally
it ended up in Andhra.

247
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,480
Though it is 900
years old antique...

248
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,640
I have got a fake carbon dating certificate
mentioning it is less than 100 years old idol.

249
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,440
So, officials will brand it as
Old category and not an Antique.

250
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,520
You may easily take it abroad with you.
Hence I'm quoting this rate.

251
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,480
0.75 million.

252
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,640
Smart. I'm impressed.

253
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,200
Thank you.

254
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,080
Nagraj, she is a hottie!

255
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,760
I shall pay you extra 50,000 bucks.

256
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,360
Nagraj, find out if I can
make her mine forever.

257
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,160
Did you take me
for a weak woman?

258
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,320
I'll scar your face!

259
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,760
India progress to the
semis by defeating

260
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,760
Australia by 5 wickets in
the 2nd quarter final.

261
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,720
Was this deal necessary?
That too at this hour?

262
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,480
What about that thing
I asked you for.

263
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,760
Oh! Here.

264
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,920
Here you go.

265
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,400
Who is this baldie?

266
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,080
Indeed a genuine party.

267
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,360
I'll myself take to the buyer

268
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
How long will you keep
working for commission?

269
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,960
On spot deal worth 100 million. A life
time deal for you. Don't miss it!

270
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,320
A treasure weighing 11 kilos and
fully made up of gold and silver.

271
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,040
I decided to sketch out a plan
and steal the world cup trophy!

272
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,680
The baldie, whom I asked to
you follow and photograph...

273
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,320
he is the guy handling the
escort duty for the world cup.

274
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,640
So, we need a team to get this done.

275
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,880
We do have our team.

276
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,200
You mean your uncle's gang?

277
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,320
No, thank you!

278
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,640
I can't control your uncle!
He keeps running his mouth!

279
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,160
He drools over women!

280
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,920
He got brains and like you say,
he runs his mouth too much.

281
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,280
But he is an expert in planning.

282
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,280
Forward it Sugumar.

283
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,640
Play the portion after
they take the painting.

284
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,520
Previous frame.

285
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,800
Forward.

286
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,720
Stop.

287
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,040
Zoom it, Sugumar.

288
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,760
Previous frame.

289
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,360
Yes! That's the moment!

290
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,520
What do you see, sir?

291
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,640
See the glow on the T
shirt, in this frame?

292
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,880
I missed it, sir.

293
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,640
"Sweet sound of
music in my ears"

294
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,800
A line from Bharathiyar's poem,
a great poet in Tamizh Nadu.

295
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,920
The great poet, Bharathiyar!

296
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,160
The one we are searching
for is a Tamizhan

297
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,480
Really?

298
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,520
I need all the details about Tamizh
thieves in Andhra police records.

299
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,160
A pack cigarette is over.

300
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,640
Still Shanon Lee isn't here.

301
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,200
Uncle, her name is Anjali.

302
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,280
Whatever it is. Amy Lee,
Devon Lee or Coco Lee!

303
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,680
Still, why isn't she here yet?

304
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,640
There's the horn.
I think it must be her.

305
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,600
How do you conclude its a female with
a horn sound? It could be a male!

306
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,040
This way.

307
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,520
Why did you come from this side?

308
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,400
Stop it you Shankar Tucker!

309
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,520
Sorry chief, I'm a bit late.

310
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,360
Next time you are late, ensure
you buy a pack of cigarette.

311
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,240
Henceforth, enter here from the rear side
of the building. That's safe for us.

312
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,040
Ok chief.

313
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,320
Now, tell us what's the matter.

314
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,560
Place it right in the center.

315
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,200
You dinkus!

316
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,600
Excellent!

317
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,840
Do you know what it?
Stupid!

318
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,320
Hope all of you are aware
of the cricket world cup

319
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,640
tournament that happens
once in every four years.

320
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,760
From 1975 to 1996....

321
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,720
every time the world cup trophy
had a different design.

322
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,960
During the 1999 ICB
general body meeting...

323
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,320
it was decided that the world cup trophy
design will stay the same from there on.

324
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,600
This design was
introduced back then.

325
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,680
The cup weigh 11 kilos.

326
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,880
Except the base, everything else
is made up of gold and silver.

327
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,040
- As of today, it is worth 0.6 million.
- Wow!

328
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,200
So, why are we discussing
about the cup?

329
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,560
That's our target. We are
gonna steal the cup!

330
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,000
Does this look like
a game to you both?

331
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,120
A game to be played.

332
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,160
Not by 11 players
but five of us.

333
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,200
Chief, she is talking about
Lockup not World Cup!

334
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,480
Wow! That was some rhyming!

335
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,480
Buddy, I gotta pay the
electricity bill. See you.

336
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,160
I shall ensure he gets
it done properly.

337
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,320
If we execute this, the
deal is worth 100 million!

338
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,200
- 100 million!?
- 100 million!?

339
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,840
One...two...three...Wow!

340
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:41,480
This lock is owned by the folks staying above you,
opposite to you, next to you and below you...

341
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,800
but the key to it? Only I got it!

342
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,520
So, remember the name...

343
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,120
Gaja locks.

344
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,600
So Mr. Police, when
are you leaving home?

345
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,200
Only after I see you off first.

346
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,680
No way. Let me join you.

347
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,320
Ok you doofus!

348
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,080
- Time for damage control.
- Stop!

349
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,800
You say its worth 0.6 million but
she says the deal is 100 million.

350
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,240
Tell me the truth. Where did
you get the information?

351
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,280
The function during which
the trophy was launched...

352
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,600
All the five captains who won the
world cup from 1975 to 1996...

353
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,960
have themselves signed their
autograph on the trophy's base.

354
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,160
Out of those five captains...

355
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,200
three of them aren't alive now.

356
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,440
If ICB loses that cup now...

357
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,400
then they can never get the
autograph of those three captains.

358
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,200
Which is why 100 million.

359
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,800
If we steal this trophy...

360
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,320
- Whoa! My lord!
- Shut up!

361
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,040
Who will buy it?

362
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,480
We can melt it and make money.

363
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,480
Shut up you doofus!

364
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,800
Did she just call me a doofus?

365
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,840
Listen, an apple might cost ten bucks...

366
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,280
but if Sunny Leone takes a bite of
that apple then its worth millions.

367
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,320
Zip it!

368
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,080
He is one of the top business
magnets in our country.

369
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,280
KK!

370
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,040
These are the articles
published on him.

371
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,680
He is crazy about cricket.

372
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,040
Check this interview of his.

373
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,120
This is my cricket museum.

374
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,160
These are all my possessions, that
I have collected over the years.

375
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,680
I am crazy about
cricket, you know?

376
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,760
I'm ready to spend millions
if I like an item.

377
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,160
All the items available
in the cricket world...

378
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,480
can be found here. I have bought them.

379
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,440
I am a freak who loves
to buy and arrange them.

380
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,720
All that you saw in
this video are legal.

381
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,920
But illegally he has much more.

382
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,840
We'll steal the cup and sell it to him.

383
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,600
That's the plan.

384
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,320
There are many ways to make money.
Why this cup?

385
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,040
- Why not?
- Correct.

386
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,480
Chief, it's not like we are
honest like the great Kamarajar.

387
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,440
Actually your mouth
needs a lock first!

388
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,200
Chief, life must be a
thrilling adventure.

389
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,120
We are happy with the thrills we got.
You may get thrilled as much as you want.

390
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,120
Dresses and speaks
like a macho man.

391
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,040
- Uncle.
- We almost had it.

392
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,400
- Uncle, hold on.
- What's wrong with him?

393
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,200
I'm not the uncle who holds on.
I am the uncle who rolls on!

394
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,840
- Chief!
- You were right, Shiva.

395
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,680
Your uncle is not
the same anymore.

396
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,360
Looks like fear has
made its way into him.

397
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,400
- That must hurt!
- He will blast once provoked.

398
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,240
Damn it! When did I say that?

399
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,080
Quiet. Wait and watch.

400
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,080
Anyway, he is gonna do the ramp walk
and end up doing the damp talk.

401
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,080
Where is that hottie
trophy right now?

402
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,440
Come, I'll explain.

403
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,240
This baldie is the
deputy director of ICB.

404
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,720
I took these photos.
They are ICB officials.

405
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,240
They arrived from the head
quarters in Dubai this week.

406
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,280
Why does that concern us?

407
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,760
The baggage with that
baldie is where the cup is.

408
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,080
I don't pick such silly locks
that are used in baggage.

409
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,840
Take him and his teeth
will do the job.

410
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,600
Its sharp enough.

411
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,240
This baldie is currently
staying at the IT grand hotel.

412
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,120
- What about the cup?
- It is also there!

413
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,720
Ready Sugumar?

414
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,960
There are 42 Tamizhans in the
recent criminal records.

415
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,160
36 of them are in the prison.

416
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,920
Two of them died.

417
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,120
I spoke to the ones alive and they
are available for enquiry anytime.

418
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,400
No. No.

419
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,120
Its none of them.

420
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,160
I think they must have come
all the way from Tamizh Nadu.

421
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,880
Anyway, connect me to
Tamizh Nadu control room.

422
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,520
- Hey Anjali.
- How've you been?

423
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,400
This is the first time you are visiting my
shop. What would you like to have?

424
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,600
You own this boutique?

425
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,760
Indeed, all the collections you see here...

426
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,000
are designed by me! Entirely by me.

427
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,240
Even this one.

428
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,200
Wow! Looks awesome.

429
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,880
But I have seen this
design somewhere.

430
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,160
Fine. Come on. Forget it.

431
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,120
This is my card.

432
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,560
Not this one too!

433
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,840
It sounded good, so I
replaced Kadhi with Radhi.

434
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,200
You still haven't got rid of
this copying habit of yours.

435
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,600
- Fine. How about a photo together?
- Yeah, sure.

436
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,040
Where's my phone?

437
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,440
Here, click it using my phone.

438
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,280
- Pavi.
- Ma'am?

439
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,280
Click a photo of us.

440
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,840
Where is he?

441
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,360
Ok, it's getting
late. I'll take a leave.

442
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,960
- Turn up whenever you are free.
- Sure.

443
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,080
- Do send me these photos.
- Sure.

444
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,440
- Ok, bye. Take care.
- Bye.

445
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,200
It must be exactly like this.

446
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,960
No one should guess
that it's a duplicate.

447
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,360
How about a touch and feel?

448
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,840
Stop talking like my Uncle!

449
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,960
- Weight?
- 11 kilos.

450
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,520
- Height?
- Two feet.

451
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,800
Only the globe is made up of gold,
rest everything is made up of silver.

452
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,920
What is it? Impossible?

453
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,320
How much will you pay?

454
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,200
How long will take?

455
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,480
It will take some time.

456
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,200
Even making the original cup
wouldn't have taken so long

457
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,560
Such T shirts are
in trend currently.

458
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,520
Every street has at least four
of them wearing such T shirts.

459
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,920
Let me know if you have
any better clue, sir.

460
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,640
Sir, talking to them over
phone ain't gonna work out.

461
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,240
Aren't you going to Chennai
for a friend's wedding?

462
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,400
Why don't you meet the
Commissioner there?

463
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,920
The wedding is already
over Sugumar.

464
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,000
My wife is furious at me.

465
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,720
No way, George is a very
sweet person, aunty.

466
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,440
He will make it to the
wedding for sure.

467
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,680
I wish I could say so.

468
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,480
He just doesn't let me do it.

469
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,800
Diya, please take
these gifts inside.

470
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,000
In a minute.

471
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,360
You eat.

472
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,880
Oh, come on! Just
pick up the call!

473
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,760
Uh-oh!

474
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,360
Sir.

475
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,520
What is it Sugumar?

476
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,200
That Bharathiyar T shirt...

477
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,200
is supplied by a company
named Ravi garments.

478
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,600
Almost...

479
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,920
0.3 millions have been sold.

480
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,360
It's ok.

481
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,840
You carry on with your work.

482
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,040
Hey Chatter box, you there?

483
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,160
I'm kinda upset.

484
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,080
What happened?

485
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,400
Did you check your email?

486
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,920
My email?

487
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,480
Just a minute. Let me check.

488
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,160
I was arranging the gifts yesterday...

489
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,880
and a glass painting in
that fell down and broke.

490
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,080
- It's all because of you!
- What's my fault?

491
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,480
If you had come down, I would have
asked you to handle the gifts and...

492
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,120
I would have been free.

493
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,000
This mishap wouldn't have
occurred at the wedding.

494
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:34,080
Whoa! Anyway, do not cut your hand
while cleaning the mess. Careful.

495
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,080
Love you.

496
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,360
Sir, the file is ready.

497
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,520
Ok. I'm coming.

498
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,280
Come on!

499
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,280
Tell me.

500
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,520
Diya, who gifted
that glass painting?

501
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,320
It was from Ramya's friend.

502
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,400
Name?

503
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,920
Why do you need those details?

504
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,080
Just tell me, Diya.

505
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,120
- Radhika.
- Radhika!

506
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,400
Where is she from?

507
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,560
Chennai only.

508
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,240
This get up suits you very well.

509
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,080
Well, such get up is a must if
you gotta screw someone up!

510
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,480
Tsamina mina eh eh Waka Cuppa
eh eh...All set with the cup?

511
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,920
11 kilos and 2 feet.

512
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,440
Autographs of all the captains.

513
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,480
Perfect!

514
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,440
All our tools are perfect!

515
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,560
Bai, we must soon open a
similar shop in London.

516
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,120
Only then we can snatch the original
world cup's manufacturing order!

517
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,080
Sir, I too wish to
settle down abroad.

518
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,480
- Your native?
- Vellore.

519
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,240
So, you will settle abroad and...

520
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,360
we must get arrested in the
Vellore prison. Isn't it?

521
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,760
You want me to shut it and pack.
Right?

522
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,360
You can pack it only
if you shut it.

523
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,520
Make it fast. Pack it.

524
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,600
Why am I digging my
own grave here?!

525
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,760
Ms. Radhika?

526
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,200
Didn't you attend Ramya's wedding?

527
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:19,840
Yes.

528
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,840
Ramya told me that you
gifted her a glass painting.

529
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,120
What's the inspiration
behind that design?

530
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,000
See, I'm a
professional designer.

531
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,520
We create many new
designs every day.

532
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,920
Most of them are original ideas.

533
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,080
Don't bluff!

534
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,080
You just carry on.

535
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,920
From where did you get the
idea for that painting?

536
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,320
- Come on, tell me.
- I guess it must be a coincidence.

537
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,240
What's happening?

538
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,880
Nothing.

539
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,480
Why don't you select
another Churidhar.

540
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,440
Look, if you use that painting
for a commercial use...

541
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,920
then you will have to
face many consequences.

542
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,240
- Well, no. I...
- The truth.

543
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,640
I saw that design in my
friend Anjali's mobile.

544
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,240
I liked it.

545
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,760
Hence, I made a similar glass painting
and gifted Ramya on her wedding.

546
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,840
In whose phone did you see it?

547
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,080
Nope. She isn't picking the call.

548
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:32,840
Try again.

549
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,640
Dude, India is batting first.

550
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,600
Today they play the semi
finals against Pakistan.

551
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,880
Come on. Let's go watch it.

552
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,480
Give me her number.

553
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,800
Tell me, sir.

554
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,440
I'll send you a Chennai number.

555
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,840
Tap all the incoming and
outgoing calls of that number.

556
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,520
I'll talk to higher officials
and get the special permission.

557
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,000
Its very urgent.

558
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,400
Six Kurtis. Please pay the bill.

559
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,400
Trace this SIM card's
location immediately.

560
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,360
Ok sir.

561
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,560
SIM located sir.

562
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,160
Make it fast, Shiva.

563
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,440
In a minute.

564
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,160
I'm going upstairs.

565
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,840
I'm unable to reach Anjali.
Try calling her.

566
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,040
Ask her to come to the same
location we met last time.

567
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,840
- Anjali.
- Tell me.

568
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,720
Why did you send me back to
buy more clothes in Boutique?

569
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,160
So, you were flirting
with that girl.

570
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,160
I was talking to her
regarding a case.

571
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,000
Connect me to George sir.

572
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,640
Tell me, Sugumar.

573
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,800
Sir, the number you gave belongs
to a female named Anjali.

574
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,560
She spoke to some guy just now.

575
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,800
Shall I play it to you?

576
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,000
Yes. Play it.

577
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,800
Tell me. The same
haunted house right?

578
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,200
Exactly. Come fast.

579
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,560
Greetings. Long live Tamizh!

580
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,560
- Sugumar.
- Yes sir.

581
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,760
Locate Anjali's SIM card's
location and keep updating me.

582
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,920
Dude, Pakistan is
reeling at 150 for 6...

583
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,320
a win today and India will
be through to finals.

584
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,200
Hold on!

585
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,080
Lift it. Help me!

586
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,440
Chief, what's in this?

587
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,600
Hold your horses.

588
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,000
Shiva, at least you tell me.

589
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,320
I just can't control
my curiosity!

590
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,840
Wait and see buddy.
Open your eyes and have a look.

591
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,960
Which doofus packed a box and
then again put it in a bag?

592
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,640
Sir, that number is now emitting signals
from Arjun garden at Virugambakkam.

593
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,080
Ok.

594
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,040
Diya, you take a rickshaw
and go to Ramya's house.

595
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:47,440
Stop kidding! I bid good bye to everyone
from elders to kids in her home.

596
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,600
It will be embarrassing
if I go back.

597
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,480
Just take me along with you.

598
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,920
Fine. Come. Get in.

599
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,600
I knew something was fishy when you
said you were coming to Chennai.

600
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,960
- Sugumar.
- Sir?

601
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,840
I have turned on the GPS.

602
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,080
- Guide me to that location.
- Ok sir.

603
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,120
So this is what you
came to Chennai for?

604
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,920
- Diya!
- I thought you missed me a lot.

605
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,560
Sir, keep going straight
from that tower.

606
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,520
Chief, don't you split
Mumtaj into half.

607
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,240
What else do you expect?
To build a Taj Mahal?

608
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,840
- Shut up you lizard!
- You fool!

609
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,400
Wow!

610
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,120
Chief, I didn't expect you
will get it ready so quick!

611
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,200
I thought your team is a dummy
but you proved me wrong chief.

612
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,200
Chief, not in my wildest dream ever I thought
that I'll see the world cup so up close.

613
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,360
Is this the trophy the
whole world is expecting to see?

614
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,120
This cup is the lookalike of
that cup that looks like it.

615
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,560
Can you explain it properly?

616
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,040
That means, this is the
so called one and only...

617
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,360
duplicate.

618
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,440
Whoa! This is the duplicate?

619
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,360
Why didn't you make
it out of gold?

620
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,360
Who would make the
duplicate one out of gold?

621
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,040
It looks exactly like
the original one.

622
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,120
That's Sethu for you!

623
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,160
We made a duplicate that looks
exactly like the original.

624
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,040
- Same height...
- and exactly the same weight and attributes.

625
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,320
You can't even pledge
this one for 10 bucks.

626
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,640
But it is by using
this duplicate one...

627
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,880
we are gonna steal
the original one.

628
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,680
Let that be. How are we gonna flick
that cup from that five star hotel?

629
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,640
One click and we'll flick!

630
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,320
Get me that baldie's photo
you took in the airport.

631
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,360
Quite a fair and
handsome fellow.

632
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,560
Its quite evident that
women are his weakness.

633
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,640
We must extract the
truth from his mouth.

634
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,440
That's the spot sir.

635
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,880
What truth are you
talking about?

636
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,280
The truth about the original cup and
in which room number is it kept.

637
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,200
Where are you off to?
Say something!

638
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,760
Please be quiet and be
seated in the jeep, Diya.

639
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,520
I'll be back in sometime. Ok?

640
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,720
Chief, did you hear that noise?

641
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,920
Do you hear it in my ears?

642
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,200
Go check what it is!

643
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,360
- Shiva, join me please.
- Take the cup inside.

644
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,560
Do not miss the photos.

645
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,480
Hey! It's the police vehicle!

646
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,240
- Come on!
- We are busted!

647
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,480
Run! Run! Run!

648
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,120
Uncle, it's the police.

649
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,200
Who is he?

650
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,280
- Who are you guys?
- Take everything. Come on! Run!

651
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,280
- Run! Run! Run!
- He is here!

652
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,720
Chief, let's not get caught!

653
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,840
- Stop! The mask!
- Yes, wear the mask! Make it fast!

654
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,400
Eww! Yuck! It stinks!

655
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,200
Fast! Get down!

656
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,840
That's a lot of stairs!

657
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,280
Can't they have a lift in here?

658
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,680
Here I come...Ouch!

659
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,960
Come on! Quick!

660
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,720
Stop! Wait for me!

661
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,000
Shiva, careful!

662
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,760
Please don't beat me sir.
You already thrashed me.

663
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,200
Dude, do not reveal your face!

664
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,920
Why did you take my mask?!

665
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,640
He got me! Save me! Help! Help!

666
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,520
Hit him! How dare he catch me?!

667
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,160
Come on! Let's go!

668
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,480
Make it fast. Get in the car.

669
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,520
Come on!

670
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,080
You get in the car.
Gaja, come with me.

671
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:25,920
Quick!

672
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,240
Give that to me.

673
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,800
Come on! Come on!

674
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,000
- George, what happened?
- I'll tell you

675
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,240
Chief...

676
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,320
What is it?

677
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,120
Andhra police! Looks like the
same jeep and the same person!

678
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,080
Move.

679
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,480
Indeed its him.

680
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,480
The jeep has a AP
registration number.

681
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,560
Who the heck is calling
me at this hour?

682
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,360
Tell me...

683
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,160
Shiva...

684
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,720
he is following us again.

685
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,320
What?

686
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,840
Remember the robbery we did in Andhra?
Guess, the police is digging it up.

687
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,160
Do one thing, we shall...

688
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,480
go towards the
Royapuram factory.

689
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,480
Come there and do as I say.

690
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,600
He is nearing us!
He is nearing us!

691
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,560
Give me that mask! The mask!

692
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,120
Let me call up my dad.

693
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,360
Diya, please keep quiet!

694
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,400
Stinking socks are
better than these masks!

695
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,720
Look! Someone exactly like him.

696
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,120
Reverse! Now!

697
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,600
He is making frequent drifts!

698
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,720
What happened, George?
Tell me!

699
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,440
I'm scared of heights! They
just don't give a damn about me

700
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,200
Ready! Ready!

701
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,080
You never pay heed
to anything I say!

702
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,160
One!

703
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,240
Two!

704
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,480
Three!

705
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,320
Damn it!

706
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,800
Diya! What happened?

707
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,240
Diya! Diya!

708
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,160
- Poor lady!
- Just drive! Let's go!

709
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,400
I said go!

710
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,360
I didn't know about
the lady in the jeep!

711
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,840
She got hurt unnecessarily.

712
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,200
Looks like we're going to spend the
rest of our lives in Andhra Prison

713
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,240
Now what?

714
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,920
Let's make our peace with it

715
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:57,840
Hey!

716
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,240
It must be here.

717
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,600
It's missing.

718
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,240
Where are you guys?

719
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,600
What happened? Tell us!

720
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,400
Only one half of
Mumtaj is with us....

721
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,000
Where is the other half?

722
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:47,920
In the second half!

723
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,840
I have been trying to reach you
since evening to talk about it.

724
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,800
You didn't pick my calls.

725
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,400
How would I know that copying that
would lead to such a big issue?

726
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,400
That painting design looked good, hence
I painted the same and gifted Ramya.

727
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,840
Come on! Damn it!

728
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,240
Were you out of your mind?

729
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,840
You must have been careful!
He followed us by tracking your SIM

730
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,080
Instead of hurting him,
unnecessarily his wife got hurt!

731
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,440
- She got hurt real bad, uncle.
- Cool. Cool! Cool!

732
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,760
Let's do damage control.

733
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,400
He must have seen my face.

734
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,680
He removed my glove!

735
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,360
That's not a glove.

736
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,080
It's a mask!

737
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,640
Whatever! You removed it!

738
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,120
But didn't you cover your face?

739
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,800
He would have seen my head.

740
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,760
Then it's time for
your final rites.

741
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,360
Then,

742
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,920
is the plan to steal the world
cup trophy off the table?

743
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,200
Chief!

744
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,600
Forget the cup. Let's go home.

745
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,320
Stop talking like a fool!

746
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,480
You fool!

747
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,720
100 million!

748
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:46,000
Just because someone is following us, we
can't let our plan go down the drains.

749
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,520
We will lift the cup!

750
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,640
- Forget it, uncle.
- I forgot and forgive him.

751
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,400
I meant forget this deal!

752
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,240
Anjali,

753
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,920
you better stay with us few days.
That would be safe for you.

754
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,680
Did he notice your scooter?

755
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,520
He did.

756
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,640
Did you notice him noticing?

757
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,240
I did...but I didn't.

758
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,840
- I saw.
- What did you see?

759
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,000
I saw that he didn't see.

760
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,000
Get lost you...

761
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,680
Stop pressing the
'Sopna Sundari' spot.

762
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,400
Press the 'Tours &
travels' part too.

763
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,360
Get the spelling wrong in the print
out and top of that he shows off!

764
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,920
Uncle, hand everyone
these new SIM cards.

765
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,200
You too, throw away your old
SIM and use this new one.

766
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,480
Anjali, do not switch
on your mobile.

767
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,080
Then which phone do I use?

768
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,120
Lets all use Korean made phones, so that we don't
get traced using IMEI number. That's safe.

769
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,800
Lets all exchange our numbers alone.

770
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,600
Did that lady get hurt
real bad yesterday?

771
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,000
Yes uncle.

772
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,560
She got hurt real bad.

773
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:53,920
Poor soul.

774
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,080
Looks like he is feeling pity for her.
Lets go, give her a visit tomorrow.

775
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,840
Shall I go buy
some fresh fruits?

776
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,960
Would you stop thinking about squeezing?
I mean the fruits.

777
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,640
- Mr. Officer.
- Yes chief?

778
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,680
To prevent someone from following us..

779
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,080
We should start following him.

780
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,360
I think...

781
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,840
she must be admitted in a hospital
nearby where the accident took place.

782
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,320
So, we gotta find which hospital. Ok?

783
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,560
- Let me sit by the window this time. Please.
- No way!

784
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,280
Get in!

785
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,120
This is called the 'Jump slide'

786
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,240
Move!

787
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,600
- You sat on my lap. It hurts.
- Shut up!

788
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,560
- Chief.
- Tell me.

789
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,840
I traced it down.

790
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,400
Where?

791
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,040
Agarwal eye hospital, Porur.

792
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,640
Unable to raise hands on me...

793
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,680
you set up goons to hit me.
Isn't it?

794
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:08,920
You crazy!

795
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,560
Can't you be serious at all?

796
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,360
I could have better taken
a rickshaw and left.

797
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,960
Be with mom until you recover.

798
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,520
Don't travel to native.

799
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,120
- Here.
- Where?

800
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,400
The monkey on the jeep!

801
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,880
Chief...

802
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,400
This belongs to George.

803
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,720
I thought it belonged to you.

804
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,520
- That was an adult joke!
- Chief!

805
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,840
I was talking about the car!

806
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,160
How much is the bill?

807
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,120
That guy is right behind us.

808
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,320
Where?

809
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,560
Be casual. Don't make it look intentional.

810
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,960
I'll get you guys
admitted right here!

811
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,480
Chief, what next?

812
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,640
First, move from here.

813
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,080
Go! Quick!

814
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,080
Chief!

815
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,480
Move fast you monkey!

816
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,680
Stop rubbing me...Go try on her!

817
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,200
Chief, its indeed him.
What do we do now?

818
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,040
You do one thing. Go and
ask him what's the time.

819
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,160
Chief, are you making
me the scapegoat?

820
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,360
If he doesn't recognize you and tells you the
right time, then he doesn't recognize any of us.

821
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,720
What if he refuses?

822
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,240
Means you're time is over!

823
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,080
Chief!

824
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,480
Go, do it!

825
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,240
He looks well built. Get caught
and he will mince me up!

826
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,200
The brave son must
never be a coward!

827
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,720
Be brave and face him!

828
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,240
And today marks the
last day of that bear!

829
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,480
Smile. You look good with
a smile on your face.

830
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,360
- When will you discharge her?
- At 9:30.

831
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,360
- 9:30?
- Yes.

832
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,880
- Sir, time.
- Sir, time.

833
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,440
Now?

834
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:38,480
Its over!

835
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:39,720
Bad time!

836
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,040
Dear, time is Eight O Clock.

837
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,080
I was talking about my time.

838
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,080
Thanks.

839
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,480
Sir, here is the report.

840
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,560
 Wait. I'm coming for you guys!

841
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,880
He doesn't recognize us.
Now, that's our only trump card.

842
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,680
One among you two follow him.

843
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:06,880
Not me again.

844
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,440
He might get a doubt
if he sees you again.

845
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,600
Buddy, you follow him.

846
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,760
Isn't she jobless?

847
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,320
Are they planning a robbery
or planning to finish me off?

848
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,640
Shut up and go!

849
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,000
Guess that came out a bit loud.
Uh-oh!

850
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,240
Highlights of yesterday's match.

851
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,400
Pakistan has never defeated us
in a World cup tournament.

852
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,080
Hello Mr George, you had earlier
called up Just Dial for an enquiry.

853
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:34,560
Yes.

854
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,600
Sir, the sticker you have could
belong to a shop in Sowcarpet.

855
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,640
I have messaged you the
contact details of that shop.

856
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,400
Thank you for calling Just Dial.
Have a nice day.

857
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,320
Mumtaj trophy.

858
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:03,920
Chief!

859
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,960
He is entering the very Mumtaj
trophy shop in Sowcarpet.

860
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:07,960
Thought as much.

861
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,800
So are we heading
to prison for sure?

862
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,160
What's up Fakhrudin Bai?

863
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,840
Welcome, sir. Back soon
for the next order?

864
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,680
- This is an order.
- What's the order?

865
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,080
A guy will come here in search of me.

866
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,080
Let him. I shall give him a warm welcome.

867
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,520
Isn't this your shop's sticker?

868
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,880
Everybody uses the same
sticker for all our items.

869
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,920
Already I am tired, unable to
dispatch a huge delivery order.

870
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,160
And you come in and irritate me
with questions at early hours.

871
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,480
He will ask for my details.

872
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,720
Let him. I will tell him I
have no idea who you are.

873
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,680
That's it.

874
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,640
Who was that huge
delivery order for?

875
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,840
I have no idea. They came
it and left with the stuff.

876
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,640
He will dig in and ask
my reason of visit.

877
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,280
Let him dig. I won't utter a
word about the cup.

878
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,200
What was the product?

879
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,600
A cup.

880
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,480
A cup?

881
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,680
You! Bring that here.

882
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:58,840
Reveal it.

883
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,040
Not the truth!

884
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,560
Wipe off that crooked smile and
say exactly what I tell you.

885
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,240
If he thinks he is smart...

886
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,360
then I am street smart!

887
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,840
What is this?

888
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:11,800
A cup.

889
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,160
Sarcasm?

890
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,480
What did you deliver
and to whom?

891
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,200
Who knows? Must be for some
running race or long jump.

892
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,120
Running race?

893
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,800
- Good boy.
- I'm indeed a bai.

894
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,960
Mumtaj trophy industries, its
all a marketing strategy.

895
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,880
To hell with your
marketing strategy.

896
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,480
Sir, let me know if you need
any trophies or cups made.

897
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,120
Chief, you are out of this world!

898
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,640
Uh-oh! He is also
going out somewhere.

899
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,000
Wait. Let me follow him. Greetings.
Long live Tamizh.

900
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,880
Welcome you baldie!

901
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,640
Whoa! That's some legs you got.

902
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,920
Pick it up.

903
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,480
- Come on. Pick it up! Pick it up!
- Key!

904
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,440
Single and ready to...

905
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,480
Excuse me sir.

906
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,200
Are you a fan of Salvador Dali's works?

907
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,800
Wow!

908
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,920
That's right. How did you guess it?

909
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:16,280
Dali's art work on
you phone wallpaper.

910
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:17,960
Just a guess.

911
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,760
You guessed it right.

912
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:20,840
You know what...

913
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,640
I am also a fan of Dali's work.

914
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:23,760
Really?

915
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,720
Yeah.

916
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,560
I love his art style.

917
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,080
But it's difficult to understand.

918
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,760
It difficult for many of them.
I mean, here in India.

919
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:32,600
But...

920
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,920
you are really someone special.

921
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,080
Yeah. I am.

922
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,760
I am John.

923
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,440
Associate member director, ICB.

924
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,600
You mean International
Cricket Board?

925
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,360
- Yeah
- That's cool.

926
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,560
- I love cricket.
- Really?

927
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,560
You didn't tell
me your name yet.

928
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,280
Anj...

929
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,000
- Shilpa.
- Oh! Shilpa.

930
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,120
- It's a pleasure meeting you.
- Ok, you baldie!

931
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,160
Mesmerized by the
beauty of her eyes.

932
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:05,480
And just like that the deer
hunts down the cheetah

933
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,680
You know what Shilpa, there
is this grand party...

934
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,480
for all ICB members and their sponsors etc.

935
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,600
I would like to invite you to...

936
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,400
Don't be so formal

937
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,160
Waiting to taste you sweetheart!

938
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,280
Sure.

939
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,680
I won't miss it

940
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,360
Come on! Come on!

941
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,600
Quick! Come on!

942
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,040
Damn it!

943
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,360
Baby...come on!

944
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,480
Come on! Come on! One last time!

945
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,520
One last time!

946
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:27,840
Bulls-eye!

947
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:32,560
- Uncle.
- Tell me.

948
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:33,520
Give me a number.

949
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,480
Four.

950
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,600
Number four.

951
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:37,960
Its disabled!

952
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,400
Attaboy!

953
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,480
Shall we crash the rest?

954
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,560
All cameras crashed!

955
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:52,200
Seven rooms are blocked in the
second floor for ICB members.

956
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:53,960
Uncle,

957
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,160
get in.

958
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,000
Chief, please start
controlling your diet.

959
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,360
Even with this wheelchair,
it's very hard to push.

960
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:04,920
Sir please.

961
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,240
He is a handicap.

962
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,480
You?

963
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,680
- What?
- It tickles.

964
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,760
Have a pleasant stay.

965
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:19,680
Excellent security!

966
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:20,440
Welcome sir.

967
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,320
A woman shows up and
your hormones peps up!

968
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,320
Hey buddy,

969
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,440
say the name Robert
D'Souza in the reception.

970
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,160
How do I say that
name in pure Tamizh?

971
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,240
Huh? Robert Samosa!

972
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,560
Robert D'Samosa.

973
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,520
Room number 123.

974
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,480
She is dumbstruck as if
she has seen a ghost.

975
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,400
Room number 123?

976
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,160
- Thank you sir.
- Thank you mermaids.

977
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,760
Tik tok! Don't stop!
Keep pushing away!

978
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,040
Open it?

979
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,440
- No, shut it.
- Ok.

980
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,840
I meant your mouth!

981
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,640
Look at my darling. She
is shining so bright!

982
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,800
That cup is your responsibility.

983
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,560
Chief, I'll take care
of it like my baby.

984
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,160
Yeah, feed it some milk too!

985
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,160
Keep it there!

986
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,600
Don't you French kiss it!

987
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,840
Where is the Party who is
supposed to be at the party?

988
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:18,800
- Hello.
- Greetings.

989
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,720
- Long live Tamizh.
- Tell me Mr. Tamizh poet.

990
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,360
Room number 123...

991
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,480
You will find the
boss and his men.

992
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,680
Stop showing off and come soon.

993
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:33,320
Either in one of these seven
rooms or in the party hall!

994
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,640
That's where the world cup is.

995
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:38,080
- Gaja, head to the lobby and stand
facing away the receptionist.

996
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:42,640
Hi.

997
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,440
- Hey man! What's wrong?
- Here, let me help.

998
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,440
Bye.

999
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,280
Bye!

1000
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,560
Tag along a pig and you
can't make it eat a burger?

1001
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,360
- Instead it will make us eat crap!
- Shiva!

1002
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,800
Whom did you call a burger?

1003
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,960
I will inform you the moment I
found the original cup's location.

1004
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,560
Immediately, I must replace it
with this duplicate and get that.

1005
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,000
Isn't it?

1006
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,680
- I don't know if we are gonna replace the cup..
- We must replace him!

1007
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,000
Do it and then...

1008
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,640
go down stairs and let
me know the escape plan.

1009
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,360
No one's around.

1010
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,520
Nope. There are people here!

1011
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:17,680
Why can't it roll straight?!

1012
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,920
I hope this emergency
exit must be good.

1013
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,040
There's our vehicle.

1014
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:25,240
If the cup is not in these rooms then
definitely it must be in the party hall.

1015
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,480
So, go check the party hall and call me
immediately as soon as you spot it.

1016
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,720
What am I doing?

1017
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,000
One sweet lime.

1018
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,960
Let me be clear. THE GAME IS ON!

1019
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,160
No more comedy. No more romance.

1020
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,760
Be serious. Get up!

1021
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,000
I said, get up!

1022
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,080
All the cameras seem
to have crashed.

1023
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,000
Excuse me! Who are you?

1024
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,040
Who are you?

1025
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,480
I'm the security. Who are you?

1026
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,600
I am not the security.

1027
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:10,800
I asked, who are you?

1028
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:13,320
- Aren't you the security?
- Yes, I am. Who are you?

1029
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,680
Told you, I am not the security!

1030
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:15,720
Now that's a topsy turvy talk!

1031
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,000
Let me call the manager.

1032
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,360
Security?

1033
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,120
- Security? Huh? Security?
- Sir, please leave me. I plead you.

1034
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,000
Now, I am the security!

1035
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,120
Waiter!

1036
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:29,520
Shilpa.

1037
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,600
Why are you looking so nervous?

1038
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,040
Nope. Nothing.

1039
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,600
You are!

1040
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,720
Isn't that the world cup trophy?

1041
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:52,040
Yeah!

1042
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,080
Watch me lift it!

1043
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,520
Very nice.

1044
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:15,760
Do you want to click a photo
with that world cup trophy?

1045
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:18,000
I want the trophy
itself, you baldie!

1046
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,480
Right!

1047
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,240
This fellow? Duh!

1048
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:36,640
Uncle

1049
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,280
Yes uncle?

1050
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,480
Shiva, Anjali is
disconnecting my call.

1051
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,920
Can you go inside and check.
I smell something is fishy.

1052
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:24,400
I am sleepless, I'm wide awake and now
I plan to rob! It's all because of you!

1053
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:28,880
I just can't stop looking at you and
blushing! It's all because of you, baby.

1054
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:37,760
You are the firecrackers
that lights me up.

1055
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:42,280
And I am desperate to light
you up and have a blast.

1056
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:46,640
I can see you blush and hush!
Oh baby.

1057
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:51,600
I am your hero and I am
here for you my baby.

1058
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:55,760
Stop killing me with your look.
I can't take it anymore.

1059
01:04:56,120 --> 01:05:00,080
Your are the fire
that lights me up!

1060
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:04,960
And I am going to bring down all
I have got. Just like you do!

1061
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:08,960
So come to me baby; let
me make you mine forever.

1062
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,960
I am sleepless, I'm wide awake...

1063
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,680
I just can't stop looking at you and
blushing...

1064
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,440
Five minutes. I'll be back.

1065
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,480
I'm here for you,baby.

1066
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:50,480
Hey dude, let's just take
the cup and run away.

1067
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,880
Stupid! Can't you see those bouncers by it?

1068
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,680
Our plan will go down the drains.

1069
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,520
He got brains and like you say,
he runs his mouth too much.

1070
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,880
Let's play along with
him and steal the cup.

1071
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,320
Then at the right moment lets
leave him stranded and...

1072
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,720
those two guys are not a big deal.

1073
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,800
Lets show them how swag we are.

1074
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,040
Yes uncle?

1075
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:12,320
Did you meet Anjali? What's the update?

1076
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,440
I'm talking to her.

1077
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:14,840
Is the cup there or not?

1078
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,040
The cup?

1079
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,600
Its not here.

1080
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:23,760
What now?

1081
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,880
We are safe until the cup stays here.

1082
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,400
In ten minutes I'll fill the
room with tear gas and...

1083
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,040
lets flick the cup.

1084
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:35,880
Soft and subtle; the
way she kisses.

1085
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:40,560
She leaves me desperate; oh yeah!
That's her.

1086
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:44,840
She swept me off my feet;
she took my heart away.

1087
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:49,240
It was not the part of plan but
my youth seems to disagree.

1088
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:54,160
Don't you crack up like the champagne.

1089
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:58,560
Yet, don't you drown like
the rocks in the scotch.

1090
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:03,440
The chilly night is
driving me crazy.

1091
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:07,480
I can't control myself. I'm
done being a good guy!

1092
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:14,120
So come, let's unite and
let the rhythm flow.

1093
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:23,280
Well, you have won over me.
Come on, let's do it!

1094
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:30,240
Lost in your thoughts,
I have waited so long.

1095
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:34,840
So don't make me wait anymore, come
and lead me to heaven till dawn.

1096
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:40,040
You mesmerize me; I'm lost in you!

1097
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:08,160
I am the firecrackers
that lights you up.

1098
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:12,720
And I know that you are desperate
to light me up and have a blast.

1099
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:17,120
And I am going to bring down all
I have got. Just like you do!

1100
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:21,520
So come to me baby; let
me make you mine forever.

1101
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,880
The cup is brought to the 2nd
floor, right where you are.

1102
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,120
Where? I can't spot it.

1103
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,120
Hey! Move.

1104
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,720
Chief, they are taking the cup!

1105
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,920
Keep an eye on it. Note the room number.

1106
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,160
Here I come!

1107
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:55,080
- Move! Move! Move!
- I'm getting late. See you.

1108
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,720
- Oops! I just dashed her.
- Stupid!

1109
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:58,680
- Watch your step!
- Sorry. I beg your pardon.

1110
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,640
Please forgive me. You too...

1111
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:03,320
Nandini?

1112
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,960
Who is this fellow?

1113
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,280
- He is Suresh.
- That's not me. I am Ramesh..

1114
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,640
Well, you are new.

1115
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,440
That means, the guy who came
last week must be Suresh.

1116
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,880
He dashes me, talks non sense
and what are you thinking? You fool!

1117
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:17,080
Tell me the room number!

1118
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,960
- He just messed it up!
- Why don't you start a new innings?

1119
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,960
Where did they go?
Wonder which room it is?

1120
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,400
Inky, pinky, ponky.
Father had a donkey.

1121
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:28,080
Donkey died. Father cried.
Inky pinky ponky!

1122
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:29,720
Not this one.

1123
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:30,560
Chief!

1124
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,040
Its room number 211.

1125
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:32,880
211?

1126
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,160
- Exactly.
- Ok.

1127
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,600
- Hello?
- Gaja...

1128
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,480
211. Now!

1129
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,680
Ok. 211, on the way. Going. Going.

1130
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,600
Yeah?

1131
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,000
- How are you?
- Oh hi!

1132
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,120
Long time man!

1133
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:51,440
Where is the cup?

1134
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:52,760
How would I know?

1135
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:57,480
Boss.

1136
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,400
- Yes?
- Your room key.

1137
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:00,880
Thank you boys.

1138
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,760
- Good night boss.
- Good night boss.

1139
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,520
Good night.

1140
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:04,520
What about the cup?

1141
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,800
I am handling the escort duty for
the world cup trophy this time.

1142
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,880
That's the ICB protocol.

1143
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,520
The cup is in his room!

1144
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,200
Come down. I'll take care of it.

1145
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,000
Whoa! It chilly in here.

1146
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,240
Where did they keep the cup in here?

1147
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,840
They have sure hid refrigerator and
washing machine in the cupboard.

1148
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,680
This better be easy. So that I
could take the cup and get going!

1149
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:37,800
John.

1150
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:38,920
Excuse me.

1151
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:40,280
Yes baby.

1152
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,640
Lets drink.

1153
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:59,600
My god!

1154
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:16,040
- Your uncle's calling.
- Don't attend!

1155
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,040
Why isn't she
answering my calls?

1156
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,200
Why are these two going
into the neighboring room?

1157
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:30,520
My key?

1158
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:33,400
Boys!

1159
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,600
Which room are you in?

1160
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,240
- 5...
- 211?

1161
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:44,680
Not that. It's the next room. Come out.

1162
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:49,680
- Ever since I got him the new SIM, he keeps calling!
- Disconnect it!

1163
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,440
They keep it elsewhere and...

1164
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,000
Well, if not the trophy...

1165
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,080
at least this cutie. Let me get a taste.

1166
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:11,120
- OMG!
- Hey!

1167
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,680
- Sorry!
- Its ok.

1168
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,000
- Its ok?
- Yeah.

1169
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,600
- Which room?
- 420.

1170
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,120
I'll see you.

1171
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,880
- Nice hair style.
- See you. Bubye.

1172
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:22,560
Where is Gaja?

1173
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,160
Chief, he is in this room.

1174
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,400
Give me the key!

1175
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,160
They seem to have a plan of their own!
Traitors!

1176
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:34,000
What are you guys planning
without my knowledge?

1177
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,480
- Looks, like its him! He is here!
- I'm hiding.

1178
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,680
Who's there? Boys!

1179
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:39,800
Are you there?

1180
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:41,520
Watch out.

1181
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:44,080
Who the hell are you guys?
What are you doing in my room?

1182
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,160
- He is 'Kambi' Gaja.
- He is buddy, speaks good English!

1183
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,400
Hey you! Stop it!

1184
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:49,520
Shilpa!

1185
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:51,120
Get him! Get him!

1186
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:56,520
Come on! Come on! Run! Run!

1187
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:01,760
- You better have a good escape plan!
- Come on!

1188
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:04,480
- Where are you going, buddy?
- Keep following me!

1189
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,080
Get in! Get in!

1190
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,520
I want the window seat.

1191
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,680
Move you doofus. Don't
leave me behind!

1192
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,200
Trust me and we get 100 million.

1193
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,560
Trust a woman and we'll end
up begging on the streets

1194
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,400
- Uncle, come with me.
- What is it?

1195
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,760
What is it? Do you
wanna get married?

1196
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,680
Uncle, didn't you ask
me to follow her?

1197
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,800
So, I followed her to find
out what she was up to.

1198
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:32,840
And you doubt me?

1199
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,840
That's all right. Nothing
serious right? Go!

1200
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:35,640
Cool.

1201
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:39,760
Do you buy clothes and then tear them or do
them come torn already? I can see you knees.

1202
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:44,280
If anyone makes a plan of their
own, without my knowledge...

1203
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:45,960
then I'll have to go
back to my old ways.

1204
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:46,920
Old ways?

1205
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,280
He will lock you up
and rip you apart.

1206
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:52,640
The security will now be tightened
after yesterday's incident.

1207
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,160
We can't go to the hotel again.

1208
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,280
Hence...

1209
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,920
we are gonna steal the
cup from the stadium.

1210
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:01,040
Try booking tickets for day
after tomorrow's match

1211
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:05,880
Hello?

1212
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:11,040
Crazy fellow! How can we steal the cup
when millions of eyes will be on it?

1213
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:16,720
Nope.

1214
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,240
What else did you expect?

1215
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,000
The world cup finals is day after tomorrow
and you try booking tickets today?

1216
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,880
How about we try for
tickets in black?

1217
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,200
In black? You mean illegally?
Stop irritating.

1218
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,040
What do we do now?

1219
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:43,880
So what if we don't have tickets.
We got VVIP passes!

1220
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,160
- Yay!
- Yay!

1221
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:48,680
That cutie let me get a taste and
also got us the VVIP passes!

1222
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:52,560
This is the one and only
time you did a 'good job'

1223
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:54,680
Dinkus!

1224
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:57,000
Chief, let's celebrate this with Gateau!

1225
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,080
Gateau?

1226
01:14:59,000 --> 01:14:59,520
Cake!

1227
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,360
- That's his love for the slang!
- Nonsense

1228
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,400
So uncle, what's the plan?

1229
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,400
You head to the
stadium tomorrow.

1230
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:08,000
Tell them you are there to
ensure the security is tight.

1231
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,240
As you wish chief.

1232
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,080
- Don't forget to go in your uniform!
- Done!

1233
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:23,040
Expectation run high for the world cup
final clash between India and Sri Lanka.

1234
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,640
The finals that will take place
at Chepauk stadium, Chennai...

1235
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:30,240
is guarded with tight security and over 500 police officials
have been appointed to safe guard the surroundings.

1236
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,480
- The match starts at 2:30, sir.
- Ok.

1237
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,080
The first innings
will get over by 6.

1238
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,760
 Later in the night the final
presentation ceremony will take place.

1239
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:41,240
Good.

1240
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,560
Can I see the place where the
cup will be displayed tomorrow?

1241
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,160
Sure. Please come. I shall show you.

1242
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:47,960
You are a rock star! Come on.

1243
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:54,120
The cup will be displayed here until
the first innings comes to an end.

1244
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,560
The cup will be displayed here
during the second innings.

1245
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,200
And during the third innings?

1246
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:01,800
There are only two innings
and then it's over.

1247
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,440
Oh! It must be lifted by then.

1248
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,600
I mean one of the teams
must win and lift it.

1249
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,120
India!

1250
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:08,640
Whoa!

1251
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,320
Sir.

1252
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:21,720
Sir!

1253
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:23,280
All good?

1254
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,240
So we'll target it, lift it and sell it!

1255
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,200
Thank you sir.

1256
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:29,320
According what buddy said,
during the first innings...

1257
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:33,000
in between the Anna
pavilion and A lower...

1258
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,800
the cup will be placed here.

1259
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,040
Our first operation is called Indiran!

1260
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:39,640
Anjali, your task.

1261
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:43,720
You raise the flag, dance and
distract the whole gallery! Ok?

1262
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:47,320
Chief, so should I also
get distracted by Anjali?

1263
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:48,600
Anjali, give me your shoe.

1264
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:49,960
No, thank you chief.

1265
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,720
You must steal the cup!

1266
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:52,760
Me?

1267
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,680
Chief, I hope you have a plan B.

1268
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:00,280
Anjali can you spit on
his face on my behalf?

1269
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:05,040
If operation Indiran flops then
we send in the one down batsman.

1270
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,120
That means during the
second innings...

1271
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,560
the cup will be displayed
in the VVIP gallery.

1272
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:12,000
We execute our next operation
called operation Chandran.

1273
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,200
Shiva, that's you.

1274
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:14,960
Chief, what am I doing?

1275
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:15,920
Shut out!

1276
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:19,600
I mean you plug out the fuse of this
VVIP gallery and shut out the power.

1277
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,480
- Yeah! Just like that.
- Awesome chief! Awesome!

1278
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,560
So, what are you doing?

1279
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,680
What does captain do?

1280
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:27,000
Whole Tamizh Nadu knows it.

1281
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,000
Stop blabbing. I meant captain cool.

1282
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,200
Will he hurl things at us?

1283
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,480
If you screw up then I'll show
up during the climax and...

1284
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:33,880
screw it up further!

1285
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:36,800
I will hit sixers, win this game
for us and take the team home!

1286
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:45,800
A group of 5 has been accused of attempting a
burglary in a well know five star hotel in Chennai.

1287
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,840
Details regarding them and
their plan are yet to be...

1288
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:52,520
Five of them escaped
from my room yesterday.

1289
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:54,960
Out of them four were men and...

1290
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,480
and...

1291
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:58,800
one bloody witch!

1292
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:00,600
A female?

1293
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,160
What's her name?

1294
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:05,440
I couldn't see
anything properly.

1295
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:08,040
They had covered their faces with mask.

1296
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:11,800
But I am sure, her name is Shilpa.

1297
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:32,720
We will go live in five seconds more.

1298
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:34,400
Lets have the countdown rolling.

1299
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:35,720
Five!

1300
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,440
Four!

1301
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:43,040
Three!

1302
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:45,640
Two!

1303
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,160
One!

1304
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,880
We are live!

1305
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,200
Camera 27

1306
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,800
Camera 19

1307
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,240
I hope you guys
remember everything.

1308
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:28,640
I'll wait here. Operation Indiran - ON!

1309
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:40,800
Nithya...

1310
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,320
got some time to spare?

1311
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,400
I'm free. Tell me, what is it?

1312
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,120
Did anyone named
George come here?

1313
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,280
How does he look?

1314
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:53,160
He is built as the Baobob tree, tall
as the palm tree and fair skinned.

1315
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:56,920
See him and even you would like to....I
meant...even you would like to talk to him.

1316
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:57,880
Oh! That fellow?

1317
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,000
Go upstairs and take a left.

1318
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,360
Thanks a lot.

1319
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:01,640
Why are you searching for him?

1320
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:02,960
Because I lost him.

1321
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,320
She is a beauty. I
must visit here often.

1322
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:08,520
Where the heck did
that giraffe go?

1323
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:16,400
This picture was taken from the CCTV
footage during the theft in Andhra museum.

1324
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:20,360
Unfortunately, because of the mask,
both their faces weren't revealed.

1325
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,240
Are you sure, these two
are the main suspects?

1326
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:23,160
Yes sir.

1327
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,480
What is he digging up now?

1328
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,760
All these days I thought only
two of them are involved.

1329
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,200
- But they are a team of five.
- I see.

1330
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,120
And one among them is a girl.

1331
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,560
It's the same gang that
attacked me and my wife.

1332
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,760
Yesterday, again five members were involved
in the attempted burglary in the hotel.

1333
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,240
The theft attempt at Andhra museum and...

1334
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:42,040
the hotel burglary; do you
think it's the same team?

1335
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,080
When I enquired the ICB member...

1336
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:45,840
the girl mentioned
her name as Shilpa.

1337
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:46,960
Shilpa.

1338
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,840
But her name is not Shilpa.

1339
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:01,960
Did he leave! Whoa!

1340
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:03,640
Anjali.

1341
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,720
Are you sure?

1342
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:05,520
Yes sir.

1343
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:08,000
Uh-oh! He even has the sticker bit.
He is digging up real deep.

1344
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:08,960
We are busted!

1345
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:11,880
- Tell me, my dear spy.
- Chief!

1346
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,680
George is in the Commissioner office.
I guess…..

1347
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:18,000
Since they were talking in
secret, I couldn't eavesdrop.

1348
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:20,680
We must have thrashed him and
knocked him down the other day.

1349
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:21,760
Missed it.

1350
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:23,800
Let's lay our hands
on the trophy first.

1351
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,080
I guess, soon he will find
us and we will get busted!

1352
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:30,160
Stop worrying about him. You gotta
fuse the power here. Come down.

1353
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:32,520
Ok. Greetings! Long live Tamizh!

1354
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:37,440
Greetings! Long live Tamizh!

1355
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:42,400
Uh-oh!

1356
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:43,720
Excuse me.

1357
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,720
What did you say before
hanging the call up?

1358
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:48,760
Izh!

1359
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:50,320
You!

1360
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,520
Long live Tamizh!

1361
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,240
No dear!

1362
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,040
When you come for
the internship...

1363
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,840
you will then
understand everything.

1364
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,120
What is it dear?

1365
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:34,080
Let go of me. What
do you want from me?

1366
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:36,240
Are you hungry? Please don't torture me.

1367
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:38,600
Let go of me. I got
plans with my wife.

1368
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:40,680
I recognize this voice but I
just don't know from where.

1369
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,880
Make way! Make way!
Chief...

1370
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,520
With a mole on my
cheek, I'm in disguise.

1371
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,880
No one can doubt me. I look very different.

1372
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,440
I am in.

1373
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:02,720
What did you guys find
in the museum?

1374
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,640
Well, there were
lot of mosquitoes.

1375
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,320
We also found many
antiques that we stole.

1376
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:09,560
Where have stashed them?

1377
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,160
At chief's house in
the secret basement.

1378
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,320
- Chief? Secret basement?
- Indeed.

1379
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:15,960
Stop irritating us!

1380
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,480
Speak Tamizh properly!

1381
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:18,920
This is what they call irony!

1382
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,520
I am speaking the most
purest form of Tamizh.

1383
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:27,000
I'll thrash you so hard that you
will forget your mother tongue. Mind it!

1384
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:28,720
Where are your mates?

1385
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:31,440
- At Chepauk cricket ground.
- At the stadium?

1386
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:35,760
Camera 12.

1387
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:43,920
Camera 2.

1388
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:45,440
Camera 4.

1389
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:46,720
Yeah

1390
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,480
I'm ready.

1391
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:49,520
Heading to Pavilion.

1392
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:52,760
Anjali, everything is going according
to the plan. Did you do the dew?

1393
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,600
Err...Did you get the flag?

1394
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:56,480
I have it.

1395
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:57,400
Ok.

1396
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,200
Camera 16.

1397
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:06,640
Camera 21.

1398
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:10,080
I can intercept all the
cameras in the stadium.

1399
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,240
How many cameras in total?

1400
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,360
All together...

1401
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:16,760
64 cameras.

1402
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,960
Which camera is takes the extreme
close up shots of the cup?

1403
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,200
Camera near the cup...

1404
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,520
Camera 26.

1405
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:25,320
Hack that camera.

1406
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,320
Alright.

1407
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,040
Bulls-eye!

1408
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,480
Camera 26 in now in my control.

1409
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,040
This 3 minute video recorded
now, will keep running in a loop.

1410
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:43,640
Live telecast won't broadcast
if anyone nears the cup.

1411
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:46,120
Attaboy! Attaboy!

1412
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:46,920
Camera 5.

1413
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:47,760
We are on.

1414
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,240
Speak! Speak up!

1415
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,720
The plan is to steal
the world cup trophy!

1416
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:52,800
The world cup?

1417
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:53,320
Camera 3.

1418
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:57,720
In sometime, Anjali will come with the flag,
to the A Lower gallery by the Pavilion.

1419
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,280
And our cue will be the
moment the next wicket falls.

1420
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,400
No waste of time.
All details I know.

1421
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:03,680
You will alert me
when the wicket falls.

1422
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:07,320
And at that moment Anjali will divorce
everyone with her flag dance. Am I right?

1423
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:08,400
Divorce?

1424
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,120
I wish I could jab your throat with a rod!
The word is divert.

1425
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,640
Whatever it is! Don't disturb my flow.

1426
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:17,680
When the wicket falls, the crowd
will have all eyes on the cup.

1427
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:19,680
and at that time we will lift Anjali!

1428
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:21,480
- You!
- I can hear you.

1429
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:24,480
Why lift Anjali? If that's the plan
then I would be in your place!

1430
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,600
Uncle and his men suck big time!

1431
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:28,320
Why is he so crazy about her?

1432
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:31,000
George, what is this?

1433
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:32,960
Did your thrashing drive him nuts?

1434
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:36,120
You! This is the world cup!

1435
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:37,760
The whole world's watching!

1436
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,000
If your robbery
plan leaks out...

1437
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,120
 it will be a an insult to our country!
We'll lose our dignity.

1438
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:42,400
- We really got that?
- Idiot!

1439
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:48,560
Everyone in the country is eagerly waiting to find out
if its India or Sri Lanka who lifts the world cup.

1440
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:51,160
But it looks like before all this, these
idiots will lift the cup tonight

1441
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:53,120
Look at our plight.

1442
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,960
Tell me. What's the plan?

1443
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,200
The moment I get the signal from them...

1444
01:25:57,240 --> 01:26:01,320
I supposed to turn of the
power in the VVIP gallery.

1445
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:03,480
- Where?
- He means in the VIP seating area.

1446
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:07,640
Do you think you guys are worth it?
How dare you plan to steal the cup?

1447
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:11,600
Sir, you feel proud and applaud
when 11 Indian players lift it.

1448
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,160
And if we five Indians lift the same cup...

1449
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:15,600
you look at it as an insult!

1450
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,360
Only difference is...

1451
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,000
That they run and lift it.

1452
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,360
We lift it and run away!
That's all. Isn't it?

1453
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,320
You think you guys can steal amidst
such tight security and all cameras?

1454
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:28,280
For sure, they will steal it!

1455
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:31,120
Because they are the masters!

1456
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:39,360
That's the moment.

1457
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:09,000
Camera 26.

1458
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,200
Receiving sir.

1459
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,640
Its the bowler's 200th One
day international wicket.

1460
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:15,440
Pan to the right and focus
on the player's wife.

1461
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:18,880
Target in focus sir.

1462
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:20,680
Punch Camera 26.

1463
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,120
Hey! Whats happening with camera 26?

1464
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,720
I repeat, target in focus sir.

1465
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:30,680
I said pan to the Pavilion stands.

1466
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:32,040
Sir, I already did it.

1467
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:34,040
Then why am I seeing
the cup in the frame.

1468
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:35,640
Camera 8, you pan to the pavilion.

1469
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:37,200
Don't miss out on
her expression.

1470
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:38,280
Command received

1471
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:42,480
Parthasarathy!

1472
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,360
- Sir.
- What's wrong with camera 26?

1473
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:45,640
Go and check it, man!

1474
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,240
Damn it!

1475
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:53,920
Uncle, abort operation!

1476
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,440
What do you mean?

1477
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:57,720
What happened Parthasarathy?

1478
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:01,080
Sir, camera 26 footage was set on loop
and was punched to the live relay.

1479
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,080
- Reset it! Quick!
- Yes sir.

1480
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:04,200
Uncle!

1481
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:07,520
Uh-oh! The Bluetooth headset?

1482
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:22,080
Sir up!

1483
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:23,960
Camera 26, shift back to the cup.

1484
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:25,760
Punch camera 26.

1485
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:29,080
'Kambi' you are a goner!

1486
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:38,520
Look over there!

1487
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:49,160
Hey!

1488
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,320
- Sorry, I was just cleaning it.
- Who's this guy?

1489
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:54,520
Chief, help me tackle this.

1490
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:57,000
India is gonna win the cup! Yay!

1491
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:58,840
Here, have a beverage
and have fun!

1492
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,920
I was happy doing petty thefts,
picking locks in my native.

1493
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:07,160
Look what mess you got me into? The
whole world recognizes me now.

1494
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:09,760
Some crazy fan!

1495
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,560
Get back to your work guys.

1496
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,040
Phew!

1497
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,960
Hey dude, what happened?

1498
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Why did you screw up?

1499
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:32,680
Nuts! They rebooted the
feed at the right time.

1500
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:34,120
All that hacking went in vain.

1501
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:36,480
Its ok that operation
Indiran flopped.

1502
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:37,640
Chandran is here.

1503
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:41,240
Forget Indiran and Chandran. I was stunned so
bad that I forgot if you were my uncle or aunt!

1504
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:43,040
I would have been a goner!

1505
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:44,600
Fine, what now?

1506
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,440
Let the second innings begin.
I'll let you know.

1507
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:01,120
Ask your mates to assemble at the
Pavilion car parking in 30 minutes.

1508
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:02,760
What if I refuse?

1509
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,480
I'll finish you off
right here, right now.

1510
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:07,480
- Phone please.
- Where is his phone?

1511
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:11,720
Are you here yet?

1512
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:14,720
Can you please come
to the parking lot?

1513
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:15,720
For what?

1514
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,400
It's an emergency.

1515
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:19,200
Please come within 30 minutes.

1516
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:21,720
Mr. Mother tongue lover, 30 minutes
doesn't sound like an emergency.

1517
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:22,880
That's the situation.

1518
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,040
Ok. Where?

1519
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:26,040
Place?

1520
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:27,680
Pavilion car parking.

1521
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:31,360
Pavilion car parking!

1522
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:33,000
No way! That's not
in my mother tongue.

1523
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:34,200
I won't say it.

1524
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:47,280
Are you there?

1525
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:49,560
For now, yes.

1526
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:51,640
Tell me, which car parking?

1527
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,600
Pavilion car parking.

1528
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:56,640
In 15 minutes...

1529
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:00,240
He never speaks in any other
language than his mother tongue.

1530
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:02,120
Mr. Poet...

1531
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:03,680
got caught by the police?

1532
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:14,920
I did tell you already.

1533
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:18,040
They are the masters!
The cup is ours!

1534
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,960
The cup is ours.

1535
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:31,880
The cup is ours.

1536
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:34,040
Aren't these your group mates?

1537
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:35,200
Indeed.

1538
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:36,640
Watch me nab them all.

1539
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:38,240
Damn you!

1540
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:42,480
Buddy's caught by the police.

1541
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:46,560
What? Buddy's caught?

1542
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:49,760
He is the only officer
whom we had on our team!

1543
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,240
And the police caught him?

1544
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:54,040
It's over. Next they will nab us.
Cut the call. Let's go home!

1545
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:55,800
Listen, there is no change in the plan.

1546
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:57,600
Next, operation Chandran.

1547
01:31:57,640 --> 01:31:59,920
If Chandran is getting operated then his
family will take care of everything.

1548
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,320
Why should we disturb them?

1549
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:02,560
Listen to me, let's go home.

1550
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,920
The cup is ours. Come on!

1551
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:07,520
Stop it! It's too late.

1552
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:09,120
Buddy's caught by the police.

1553
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:10,320
Who will turn the power off?

1554
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:11,840
Are your hands busy?

1555
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,040
No way. I am not doing it.

1556
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:17,080
- I might get electrocuted.
- You are doing it!

1557
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:18,520
Go!

1558
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:20,440
Ok. Hang up.

1559
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:22,920
This is irritating!

1560
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:36,360
- Please come.
- Is this the entrance? ?

1561
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,440
This way.

1562
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:47,960
- Let's go and  inform about this in the broadcast control room.
- Ok sir.

1563
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:14,680
Power room, Anna university
err...its Pavilion.

1564
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:15,800
Punch 20.

1565
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:19,120
Sir, please alert our guards. I'll be back.

1566
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,080
Ok George.

1567
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:23,480
Shiva.

1568
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,560
Everything looks...

1569
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,160
VVIP....

1570
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:08,000
Shiva!

1571
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:09,320
VVIP gallery right?

1572
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:10,440
I found it.

1573
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,480
'Kambi'...

1574
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:12,880
All set.

1575
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:16,000
The second I complete the
countdown, you turn off the power.

1576
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:23,080
Five.

1577
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:26,440
Four.

1578
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:27,920
Damn it! Make it fast!

1579
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:31,560
Three.

1580
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:35,440
Two.

1581
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:39,080
One!

1582
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:40,920
Power off!

1583
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,560
Shiva! What happened?

1584
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:56,360
Three.

1585
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:00,440
Two.

1586
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:03,640
One.

1587
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:08,040
You!

1588
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:26,320
Look at the size...of the gun.

1589
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:29,680
If I had lifted it, they
would have shot me dead!

1590
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:31,640
Shiva! What happened?

1591
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,800
What a pity, Sir!

1592
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,600
Did you replace the cup?

1593
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:40,800
You pothead!

1594
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:45,280
You turned off the power of
a different VIP gallery!

1595
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:46,640
Damn it!

1596
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:47,720
Shiva!

1597
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:49,840
I see another box named, VVIP gallery 2.

1598
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:51,120
Shall I turn of the power there?

1599
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:51,880
No, you damn it!

1600
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:54,680
Question the electrician if you get
problem with the connection. Not me.

1601
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:56,200
Clear out from there at once!

1602
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:56,960
I shall come.

1603
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,600
Wait at the rest room.
I'll come there.

1604
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:30,520
- Gaja
- What?

1605
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:31,320
Where are you?

1606
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,800
I'm at the VIP AC lounge.
Stop irritating and come there.

1607
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:35,120
Wait, I'll come.

1608
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:36,640
Damn you!

1609
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:38,720
You are unsuitable
to be a robber!

1610
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:41,240
You can't even steal a cup!

1611
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:05,640
Aren't these your group mates?

1612
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:07,240
Indeed.

1613
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,800
Watch me nab them all.

1614
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:08,640
Let go of me!

1615
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,960
- I said, let go of me.
- Lock him up!

1616
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:17,920
- Quick!
- Make it fast.

1617
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:28,320
I was suppose to lift the
cup, look he lifted it.

1618
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:33,600
Team India that won the recently concluded
cricket world cup at Chepauk...

1619
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:40,480
and it is been speculated that instead of the original cup, India
has been awarded, what they call the replica of the world cup.

1620
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:45,720
The procedure is to return the original, perpetual
trophy back to the head quarters in Dubai.

1621
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,320
But this time...

1622
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:50,480
the original trophy has been
seized at the customs office.

1623
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:54,680
But nothing to worry because we never
hand the original cup to the winners.

1624
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:56,480
We present them with the replica.

1625
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:59,840
Since the ICB council refused
pay the custom taxes...

1626
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,840
the perpetual cup that is made
up of real gold and silver...

1627
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:07,000
has been seized by the customs
officers at the airport.

1628
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:08,640
What's all this drama?

1629
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:10,200
Its all confusing to me!

1630
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:13,120
I knew it! The autographs
were missing in the cup.

1631
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:15,000
And you say it now! You crackpot!

1632
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,520
First of all the world cup we are
in pursuit of, is not here at all!

1633
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:19,560
It's in the warehouse.

1634
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:21,360
So, let's head to the warehouse.

1635
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:22,600
Uncle...

1636
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:24,680
we just bashed that officer up.

1637
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,000
It's not safe to go there.

1638
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:29,000
The best part is that the cup
hasn't returned to Dubai yet.

1639
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:30,280
It is still in the warehouse.

1640
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:32,360
It is waiting for us.

1641
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:33,640
We will go there...

1642
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:34,880
and steal it.

1643
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:44,520
Where the heck are you?
Make it fast!

1644
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:46,760
- Come to car parking.
- Wait. I'm coming.

1645
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:50,400
Did the ICB also get the cup made
at the same Mumtaj trophy shop?

1646
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:52,000
Duplicate is different from the replica.

1647
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:09,400
Hold him! Knock him down!

1648
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:31,880
Come...come

1649
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:36,840
Look over there.

1650
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:39,000
Strong room. It must be there.

1651
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,400
Hey! Let go of him!

1652
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:47,120
- Don't let go of him!
- He is going!

1653
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:48,240
Its the police!

1654
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:49,600
Come here, you!

1655
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:53,840
- Sir! Please let go of him.
- One punch and...

1656
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:56,480
you brain will splash out.
Where are the others?

1657
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:57,240
- Sir!
- Sir...

1658
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:58,840
- Put him in the jeep.
- Thank you sir.

1659
01:40:58,880 --> 01:40:59,880
Arrest them!

1660
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:02,960
Freeze!

1661
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,640
Welcome! Welcome officers.

1662
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:08,200
Well done! You just jinxed the cliche
of arriving after everything is over.

1663
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:10,320
You are under arrest.
We are from customs.

1664
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:11,640
So, aren't you my uncle?

1665
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:12,920
I don't care if I'm
your uncle or butler!

1666
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,720
Is it not possible that your
uncle works in customs?

1667
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:17,760
You may be in customs but what's with
the custom of putting me in trouble?

1668
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:19,520
Handcuff him!

1669
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:20,800
I cuss you all!

1670
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:23,040
Can't you let us
criminals live in peace?

1671
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:24,640
Do it properly.
Didn't you get your salary?

1672
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:25,800
Please don't tighten
it too much.

1673
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,520
Fool! He just nodded
yes to my request!

1674
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,520
- Move! Keep waking!
- I need to speak to my lawyer.

1675
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:37,520
A group from Palavakkam consisting of Sethu,
Shiva, Anjali, Padmanaban and Gaja...

1676
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:41,480
are slammed with a five year prison
term by the Chennai high court.

1677
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:47,520
Order have been passed to the police to
retrieve all the illegal possessions.

1678
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:50,040
From wig to shoe;
everything is fake!

1679
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:51,120
That wig...

1680
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:53,800
George.

1681
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:56,760
George sir, we agree
that we stole all this.

1682
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,640
It makes sense that you
are seizing them all.

1683
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:03,400
But we stole...err..we bought that duplicate
cup from Sowcarpet, with our hard earned money

1684
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:05,840
As per law, it's illegal if
you seize that from us.

1685
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:08,200
How dare you teach me law?

1686
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:10,120
- As human you all must have some discipline.
- Correct, sir!

1687
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:12,600
Some discipline? He thinks we should share
discipline like Panjali, among 5 of us.

1688
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:13,760
- Anjali, move.
- Chief...

1689
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:15,920
Why is he teaching
us discipline?

1690
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:18,480
- Is he a high school teacher?
- part time teacher I guess

1691
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:20,920
Chief, show me your fingers.

1692
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,240
It's my finger.

1693
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:24,840
Didn't these finger touch the original
world cup that resembles this duplicate?

1694
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,880
There another important thing.
I'll show you. Come.

1695
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:29,160
All we got is this cup from Sowcarpet.
Isn't it?

1696
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:31,920
Now, you may kiss, here.

1697
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:33,760
Chief, we don't wanna
kiss this duplicate.

1698
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:36,360
The original cup, that is in
Dubai, we are talking about that.

1699
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:37,440
Fools!

1700
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:41,320
This is the waka-waka,
original one!

1701
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,880
Look, here is the original.

1702
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:47,800
The sticker!

1703
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:49,240
Quick, change the sticker!

1704
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:52,520
Keep the duplicate in
the exact same position.

1705
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:54,080
Yep, that's the place.

1706
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:55,680
Now, come on.

1707
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:57,440
Freeze! Don't move!

1708
01:42:57,480 --> 01:42:58,880
Welcome! Welcome officers.

1709
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:00,760
No! No relationships! Arrest him.

1710
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,080
Stop it! You rascal!

1711
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:06,520
The exact same sticker!

1712
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:09,640
This is the duplicate cup
made in the Bai's shop.

1713
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:11,160
I have already been to this shop.

1714
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:14,080
We reached here on time. Keep
the original one back there.

1715
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:28,800
Wow!

1716
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:32,000
Don't cry, dear.

1717
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:33,800
So, that one?

1718
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,240
That's out of the
gate- the duplicate!

1719
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:37,400
Go ahead, kiss it.

1720
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,560
I won't kiss it. Let me lick it.

1721
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:44,400
Good job.

1722
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:45,560
Thank you sir.

1723
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:46,560
Sir!

1724
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:08,920
(After the period of imprisonment)

1725
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,000
The original perpetual cup that
was suppose to go to Dubai.

1726
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:22,760
Has come in search of you, now here,
at your door steps, on your table.

1727
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:26,080
This cup will be the main attraction
amidst your secret collections.

1728
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:27,000
What do you say?

1729
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:29,880
If needed, we can give him
a discount of 2000 bucks.

1730
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:30,760
You beggar!

1731
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,040
- Me?
- Indeed!

1732
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:35,520
Look there Mr.Bean,
that's Gavaskar's vest.

1733
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:37,240
I wonder if he had given
it to the laundry.

1734
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:39,800
But he has framed it just
because Gavaskar wore it.

1735
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:41,720
I wonder where is Ganguly's guard.

1736
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:43,800
So, tell me. Is it
a deal or no deal?

1737
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:45,960
I'm happy. Deal!

1738
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:46,840
Yes!

1739
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:03,480
I have no idea what
to do with the money!

1740
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:06,440
- I feel awesome. How much for your whole shop?
- Tea! Have some tea!

1741
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,680
- I shall buy it soon.
- Here, have the tea.

1742
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:11,880
Chief, my body is slowly ceasing
up after seeing all that money.

1743
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:14,880
All we need to worry if that the car
shouldn't cease up. That's all.

1744
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:15,840
Shiva!

1745
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:17,840
Where is my phone?

1746
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:19,040
Its over there.

1747
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:20,720
Its not here.

1748
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:22,760
Sorry.

1749
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:25,160
- Hold this.
- Give that left over tea.

1750
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:28,480
- Gandhiji is laughing on all the notes!
- People would have laughed at us if we had got caught.

1751
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:29,360
Quick, let's go!

1752
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:30,920
What's the secret guys?

1753
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:33,240
How do we split the money?
By counting or weighing it?

1754
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:35,880
- Hey! They left with the money!
- Stop!

1755
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:38,640
- Shiva stop! Shiva!
- Stop! Hey!

1756
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:39,880
Chief?

1757
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:41,400
Fools!

1758
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:48,880
Welcome back Mr. Honest guy!

1759
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:50,040
Look at him!

1760
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:51,280
Uncle.

1761
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:52,400
What is it?

1762
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:53,920
Are you here to bid goodbye?

1763
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:55,640
No uncle.

1764
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:01,280
2200/- sir.

1765
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:04,440
Anjali, get 3 notes
from the 2nd bundle.

1766
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:06,600
Lady luck is here...

1767
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:08,880
she showered a trunk
full of fortune.

1768
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:10,240
- I was about to fall...
- Sir,

1769
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:11,680
1000 rupees notes are
are no longer accepted.

1770
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:18,240
Its in the headlines. 500 and 1000 rupees currencies are
invalid henceforth. PM has announced this just now!

1771
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:28,200
The flash news: The 500 and 1000 rupees
currencies are invalid henceforth.

1772
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:30,200
Now, this is a game changing move.

1773
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:34,160
500 and 1000 rupee
notes will become...

1774
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:38,680
just worthless piece of paper.

1775
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:40,880
For few days, it will be accepted
only here for filling diesel.

1776
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:43,080
 Fill up diesel for 100 million rupees?
You kidding me?

1777
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:44,840
Invalid currencies?

1778
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:45,920
- What?
- What?

1779
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:47,440
- Invalid currencies?
- Its banned?

1780
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:56,880
The Show stealers with a plan!

1781
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:06,120
In total there were five cups.
One deal is down the drains.

1782
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:08,880
Remaining four of them. I'm trying to
call Ambani but not he is reachable.

1783
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:10,360
Shall I give it a try?

1784
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:12,520
- Why don't you give it a try?
- Sure!

1785
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:14,960
Chief, what about the cup we sold?

1786
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:16,520
Why sticky?

1787
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:20,640
C/O Mumtaj second hand shop,

1788
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:21,520
Sowcarpet.

1789
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:22,320
Uncle!

1790
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:25,320
So the one we sold just now?

1791
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:26,640
Again a duplicate?

1792
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:27,640
Chief...

1793
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:29,840
- Then where is the original cup?
- Indeed! Where is it?

1794
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:32,520
Excellent question! Answer this chief!

1795
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,040
Go home and think over it!

1796
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:37,600
If we still don't get an answer?

1797
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:41,920
Then come back and
watch another show!
