1
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,400
Meet Suryanarayana... He is blessed with a child
but God took away his loving wife.

2
00:01:27,525 --> 00:01:31,650
Out of pure love,
he named his child Kanna (darling).

3
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:36,566
You don't do that, son...

4
00:01:36,816 --> 00:01:40,066
The pots will break and the plants will rot...
- No, son...

5
00:01:41,775 --> 00:01:45,233
What happened to my darling?
- Nothing really.

6
00:01:45,358 --> 00:01:48,150
I just asked him not to kick
the flowerpots.

7
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:51,608
Darn the flowerpots. I'll get a hundred more.

8
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:54,108
How dare you ruin his happiness.
Move away!

9
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:57,441
You kick them all, son...
I'm there with you.

10
00:01:57,941 --> 00:01:58,733
Push...

11
00:02:00,358 --> 00:02:03,483
He loved his son unconditionally
after the death of his mother.

12
00:02:09,776 --> 00:02:14,160
He also understood that excessive pampering
made him a notorious child.

13
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:21,000
A teacher used to beat him up
because of his notorious behavior.

14
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,714
One day she...

15
00:02:29,406 --> 00:02:31,350
He had two habits from his childhood...

16
00:02:32,475 --> 00:02:36,848
One, he'd dance like no one is watching
when he is extremely happy!

17
00:02:42,369 --> 00:02:47,127
Two, when someone does something wrong,
his hand begins to itch!

18
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:11,775
Thank you.

19
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:17,733
The itching won't stop
till he beats him.

20
00:03:22,908 --> 00:03:29,202
If Surya narayana is contemplating in this chaos,
that means Kanna has come of age.

21
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:40,316
Why are you giving in such a low price?

22
00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:42,733
We decided upon another amount
and you are giving me in one.

23
00:03:42,858 --> 00:03:46,566
Last night's amount is a pass. Take it.

24
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:48,358
I've seen people cheat a lot...

25
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,275
Give me the amount we decided upon else,
unload the vehicle.

26
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:54,941
Once it's loaded the stuff is mine.

27
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:56,525
Take it if you like...

28
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:59,316
Or forget both the money
and the stuff.

29
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,191
Push him...

30
00:04:40,025 --> 00:04:43,691
Kanna, you have come to drop me in the yard,
not to get into a fight.

31
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:47,733
Wait uncle... I understood the issue,
let me settle it.

32
00:05:18,691 --> 00:05:22,733
Who are you to settle our issue.
Mind your business.

33
00:05:24,316 --> 00:05:28,025
This is not your yard to boss around,
not even your grand father's.

34
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,733
Any one can come here and do business.

35
00:05:32,191 --> 00:05:34,691
Give that man his due respectfully.

36
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:37,941
What's bothering you?
- It really bothers him.

37
00:05:38,066 --> 00:05:41,983
You can't take it. Kanna, this is very common
in the yard... Let's go.

38
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:45,233
Yeah, tell him the way he understands.
- Oh brother...

39
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:50,233
Once my hand begins to itch
I don't understand anything anyone says.

40
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:53,025
Stop the shit and give him his due.

41
00:05:53,316 --> 00:05:56,775
That's far from happening.
If your hand itches, scratch it!

42
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,691
This is not that kind of feeling. I tried.

43
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:02,941
Put some lotion on.

44
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:05,316
That didn't help either I tried.

45
00:06:05,441 --> 00:06:06,775
Then how?

46
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:12,816
How?

47
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:32,108
When I punch like this.

48
00:06:32,483 --> 00:06:34,400
Oh... it is already going down...

49
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:38,775
Guys, help him with the itch.

50
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:44,441
When someone does something wrong,
my hand gives the answer.

51
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:48,316
My brain says mass handling is wrong,

52
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:52,441
I end up having a tough time balancing
these two things.

53
00:06:52,858 --> 00:06:56,900
You beat up when someone asks
if you did something wrong?

54
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,483
Your mustache has grown like that of Veerappan's
but not your brains.

55
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:04,191
Still... to reduce my itch...

56
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,025
You should take the beating.

57
00:07:50,025 --> 00:07:53,608
Do your business with honesty...

58
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:55,858
But not this kind of chaos.

59
00:07:56,733 --> 00:08:01,566
Guntur and Guntur chilies both
have great reputation in the Telugu states.

60
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,733
Don't ruin it.

61
00:08:15,358 --> 00:08:18,316
Wow, now the itch has stopped.
what do you think?

62
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:20,691
Your itching has stopped
He learnt his lesson too.

63
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:22,025
Let's go.
- Take care.

64
00:08:24,066 --> 00:08:24,941
Hey...

65
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,441
Chilli...

66
00:08:41,357 --> 00:08:46,233
I won't say anything to you...
Because I have nothing else to say.

67
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:51,441
There's one thing I understood very well
as I raised you from childhood...

68
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:52,608
What is that, father?

69
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,608
It's better to raise a dog than a son.

70
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:57,483
How can you pass such a statement?

71
00:08:57,566 --> 00:09:00,400
It's not a statement
or philosophy either.

72
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:04,900
The things he did from his childhood
have been giving me too much stress.

73
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:08,066
This little dog is my stress buster.

74
00:09:08,608 --> 00:09:13,150
Else what would have happened to me
because of his torture.

75
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:17,566
Stop with that pathetic emotion, dad.
It's very unlike you.

76
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,775
Anyway, lemme tell you
why you liked that puppy...

77
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:21,525
Oh... Why?

78
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:24,608
Basically you have no expectations from it.

79
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:28,983
And a son, you want him to pursue higher studies,
get a great job,

80
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:30,608
Become a scientist,

81
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:35,025
Withheld the reputation of the family
and many such exceptions.

82
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:38,483
Please have no expectations from me.

83
00:09:38,816 --> 00:09:40,941
Even I look as cute and chubby...

84
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:43,525
I can get more kisses than it.
What do you think, uncle?

85
00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:45,150
Stop your stupid logics...

86
00:09:45,358 --> 00:09:48,233
Had you shown such kind of basic logic
in your life.

87
00:09:48,275 --> 00:09:51,025
You would have become a much
better person in life. Useless fellow...

88
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:54,733
And you need a gang of jobless friends for this.

89
00:09:54,816 --> 00:09:57,608
Why do you scold him so much?
He's not a spoiled kid.

90
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,441
Are you supporting him?

91
00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:02,525
If you get him married...

92
00:10:02,775 --> 00:10:06,816
he'd get diverted.
He'd get more responsible.

93
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:10,858
You are right, Vishwanadham.
who would get his daughter married to him.

94
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:14,066
Everyone is only trying to escape.

95
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:18,566
No.. there's a guy named Somesh...
He's looking for a groom for his daughter.

96
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:22,233
The girl is very nice...
I'll make arrangements if you are ready.

97
00:10:22,316 --> 00:10:24,025
Uncle, I have a doubt...

98
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:26,025
Are you my father's friend
or a wedding planner?

99
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:28,191
How can you say that to me...
- Shut up.

100
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,650
Don't say anything to him.
We are going to see this girl.

101
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:37,275
If you are scared,
tag your funny friends along with you

102
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:40,316
Put on some 'fair and lovely'
on to your face and get ready. Go

103
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:42,275
Go.

104
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:49,441
God! Please make sure this alliance is confirmed.

105
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:53,233
If only the bride walks in early.
Even we can start eating.

106
00:10:53,316 --> 00:10:55,775
The girl is getting ready.
She'll take another 15 minutes,

107
00:10:55,816 --> 00:10:57,275
Please don't mind.

108
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:58,650
That's okay,

109
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:02,483
Can we have sweets in mean while...
- Oh please, those are for you to eat.

110
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:03,608
Oh... thanks uncle.

111
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:06,233
Eat... eat...

112
00:11:07,191 --> 00:11:10,316
I unnecessarily told him
to call these fellows to come.

113
00:11:11,816 --> 00:11:13,733
Dad, I'll just attend to this call and come back.

114
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:18,025
Who is calling you now?
Must kill the guy who made cell phones.. Go.

115
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:25,941
Phone? Darn... It's a bad habit...

116
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:06,733
Hey, Kanna, come here...
the girl is ready.

117
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:19,233
What are you staring?
Give me that phone...

118
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,066
See...
- Please get the girl...

119
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:34,775
Come dear...

120
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:42,941
Look at the pretty girl..

121
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:45,691
Yeah.. he's looking...

122
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,025
Look at the girl...

123
00:12:57,191 --> 00:13:00,441
He's the only guy
who'd look at a girl like that.

124
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,025
So, you like the girl?

125
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:05,608
His eyes are saying it all.
Do you need verbal validation from him?

126
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:08,108
No more discussions...
let's exchange commitments.

127
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,108
What do you say?
- Yes...

128
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:12,941
We'd be happy to hear it
from the groom, Mr. Surya Narayana.

129
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:16,775
Kanna... Say it, son.
they won't believe it otherwise...

130
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:23,525
I want to think about it in solace
and tell you..

131
00:13:23,816 --> 00:13:28,858
They'd like to talk to the girl personally.
what will you think about in solace

132
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:33,316
People think differently these days. Let him go...

133
00:13:33,483 --> 00:13:36,650
You have such an understanding father-in-law...

134
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,275
Go!
- We'll keep eating in meanwhile...

135
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,400
What did you decide?
- It's okay... tell...

136
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:21,983
Did you like the girl?

137
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,900
Looks like he's a shy guy.

138
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:26,608
He's hesitating to admit
among so many people.

139
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:30,025
I am not shy!
I didn't like the girl...

140
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,941
If you like the girl you must tell on the spot.
If you don't, you tell us personally.

141
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,733
You did this because you are not interested
in getting married, right?

142
00:14:41,108 --> 00:14:45,483
We went with the excitement of finding a girl¦
but... you ruined it.

143
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:49,525
Don't get stressed, father.
you have a stress buster, right?

144
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:53,066
Oh, dear...

145
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:55,733
Bhasha bro, one tea...
- Okay, bro..

146
00:14:57,316 --> 00:14:58,983
Bro, I have a doubt...

147
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:03,233
The bride we saw was beautiful, right?
why did you reject her?

148
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:04,983
Well...
- Well what?

149
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:08,025
Well...
- Stop it and tell us the truth..

150
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,066
I liked the bride's friend more...

151
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:17,525
Oh, that's what you were eyeing on...
- You checked out the bride's friend.

152
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:18,733
You are pretty amazing.

153
00:15:19,691 --> 00:15:24,066
I went crazy when I saw that girl..
My mind got disconnected looking at her.

154
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:27,733
It took melots of time
to become sober.

155
00:15:27,983 --> 00:15:29,566
You liked her so much, bro?

156
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,066
She'll definitely fall for you.
She's so yours!

157
00:15:33,275 --> 00:15:37,275
Hey kid... Love is not a child's play.
go and serve tea!

158
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:38,275
Ok...

159
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:40,483
Bro, I don't think this is love...

160
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:42,733
You just seem disturbed
because of that girl's beauty,

161
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,983
Go and take a cold water shower,
everything will be alright...

162
00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:46,525
I'll punch you straight!

163
00:15:47,025 --> 00:15:51,941
My love is sincere.
Feels like I can't live without her...

164
00:15:52,483 --> 00:15:53,941
I love her that much.

165
00:15:54,733 --> 00:15:56,691
How can you love someone
so much at first sight.

166
00:15:56,858 --> 00:15:58,691
That too it's him.

167
00:15:58,775 --> 00:15:59,816
Why would you say that...

168
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:04,108
Desire is stronger than love,
I read it on a vehicle long back...

169
00:16:04,358 --> 00:16:06,525
Oh... Well said!

170
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:11,816
Since I have seen that girl,
I feel like someone has pierced through my heart...

171
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:16,025
How are you taking the pain, bro?
- We don't believe in your love.

172
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,066
You must convince us
to make us believe in your love.

173
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:20,733
Say it, bro!
- Say it, Kanna bro!

174
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:49,441
"She's floating colors,
she's a pinch in the heart"

175
00:16:51,733 --> 00:17:00,691
"She's the cherub of the moon,
a beautiful angel"

176
00:17:03,108 --> 00:17:07,608
"Swear to the Taj Mahal, her color is bright"

177
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:12,941
"Swear to the Kohinoor, her heart is pure"

178
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:18,691
"All doors open towards this beautiful queen"

179
00:17:19,108 --> 00:17:23,900
"All doors open towards this beautiful queen"

180
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:28,275
"She's not an ordinary girl"

181
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:33,775
"The wave touches me"

182
00:17:35,441 --> 00:17:38,775
"How did she take birth?"

183
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:44,316
"I love her unconditionally."

184
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:12,775
Lord Brahma made her
with all the time and patience"

185
00:18:12,983 --> 00:18:16,108
"He pulled her cheeks maybe"

186
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:23,358
He looked at her beauty
and purged away evil's eye"

187
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,191
"Could be all green..."

188
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:33,150
"If one wants to write poems about her beauty"

189
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,566
"There are no words to describe her beauty"

190
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:42,775
"She's not an ordinary girl"

191
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:48,691
"The wave touches me"

192
00:18:49,858 --> 00:18:53,525
"How did she take birth?"

193
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:59,483
"I love her unconditionally."

194
00:19:01,025 --> 00:19:05,275
Now it looks like your deep in love, bro.

195
00:19:05,775 --> 00:19:09,316
It's going to be difficult to love someone
you don't know.

196
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,525
When angel's walk on earth...

197
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:15,650
Wars are inevitable...

198
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:41,441
Seshu, come to the rice mill immediately.

199
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:32,733
If you think I am interfering with a goon
and will excuse you about it...

200
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:36,316
You hit my man after knowing the fact
that he is our man...

201
00:20:36,441 --> 00:20:39,608
I am not a random goon...
to keep quiet.

202
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,150
I am a sitting MLA.

203
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:47,400
I don't know what you are going to do Seshu...
Finish him immediately.

204
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,650
Yes... Don't spare him.

205
00:20:49,941 --> 00:20:50,775
Finish him.

206
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:14,775
Seshu, have you gone mad?

207
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,691
I told you to kill him not my guy.

208
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:18,941
He will also instruct me?

209
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:20,858
Don't spare him. Finish him off.

210
00:21:21,858 --> 00:21:24,941
Why do you have such a mammoth of an ego?
Will you kill him for that?

211
00:21:25,441 --> 00:21:30,316
Anyways... One can file a attempt to murder case
on Babji for hitting him.

212
00:21:30,858 --> 00:21:32,066
He's dead...

213
00:21:32,816 --> 00:21:35,608
So you can directly slam him
on charges of murder.

214
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:38,900
His world will come to an end in the prison.

215
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,608
Okay?

216
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:45,941
Seshu, you are not an ordinary guy...

217
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:48,862
You relieved me from my worries. I love you.

218
00:21:48,962 --> 00:21:50,347
It's right what you seen and hear.

219
00:21:50,547 --> 00:21:54,515
But he is not criminal.
He is famous criminal lawer in Guntur.

220
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:58,999
Seshu's name sends shivers down the spine
to the local politicos, cops and goons...

221
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:04,462
Because if he gets angry he can charge
any case against anyone.

222
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,991
Thank you for helping us win the case.
- That's all right.

223
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:10,741
Thank you very much, sir.

224
00:22:10,783 --> 00:22:13,949
Hey, kiss me... kiss me... Go.

225
00:22:26,366 --> 00:22:30,699
Ego, pride, irritation, intolerance and attitude...

226
00:22:30,824 --> 00:22:34,515
Are all the negative traits
that he carries on his head.

227
00:22:38,261 --> 00:22:40,618
A week ago an incident happened.

228
00:22:41,886 --> 00:22:43,214
Chanti, get me a cup of tea...

229
00:22:45,158 --> 00:22:46,449
Give me...
- wait.

230
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,408
Can't help.

231
00:22:48,491 --> 00:22:51,616
What, Chanti? New dress and shoes,
what's the matter...?

232
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:53,658
Are you getting married?

233
00:22:53,949 --> 00:22:55,981
It's his birthday today.
He went to the temple...

234
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:59,741
Amazing. Happy Birthday!
- Thanks, brother.

235
00:22:59,824 --> 00:23:02,658
What about our treat?
- How can I treat you, bro?

236
00:23:02,824 --> 00:23:05,199
My mother does a day job, father's dead.

237
00:23:05,324 --> 00:23:07,241
I am working to help mother
in her finances..

238
00:23:07,324 --> 00:23:10,199
My entire month's earnings are not enough
to treat you for a day.

239
00:23:10,283 --> 00:23:13,533
Okay, bro, don't pay for the tea.
Consider it as my treat.

240
00:23:13,574 --> 00:23:15,908
Darn you, I was kidding.

241
00:23:16,491 --> 00:23:20,116
I'll treat them all on your behalf. okay?

242
00:23:20,158 --> 00:23:21,658
Okay, bro.
- Bro...

243
00:23:21,783 --> 00:23:25,533
Come to Nagarjuna grand tonight...
Cake cutting must be the highlight.

244
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:29,074
Mr. Koteshwar Rao...
- Yes.

245
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,533
Do you know why I am helping you
with everything?

246
00:23:31,574 --> 00:23:36,449
Don't imagine that you are smart
just because you are a criminal lawyer...

247
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:39,908
God has bestowed us with some brains.

248
00:23:39,991 --> 00:23:42,741
This is my fourth time as a MLA.

249
00:23:43,449 --> 00:23:47,699
He has become old.
Won't stand for the next election...

250
00:23:47,866 --> 00:23:50,241
And I don't have a heir...

251
00:23:50,408 --> 00:23:53,949
Your eyeing my ticket, right?

252
00:23:54,116 --> 00:23:56,366
You have lots of brain not little...

253
00:23:56,949 --> 00:24:00,866
I have earned a lot from my cases...
I am bored now.

254
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:02,783
I have to reach the next level...

255
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:03,908
What do you think?

256
00:24:03,991 --> 00:24:07,741
How can you help me.
don't we know about each other?

257
00:24:07,866 --> 00:24:12,658
It's better that you get the seat
than anyone else...

258
00:24:12,824 --> 00:24:16,616
Let's get an appointment from the CM
and talk to him first.

259
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:20,241
Hey, come here..

260
00:24:21,324 --> 00:24:23,824
What's with the noise?
- It's a birthday party sir...

261
00:24:24,158 --> 00:24:26,866
Send them away...
- Send them off...

262
00:24:28,699 --> 00:24:30,991
Wait... the beers are here...
- Beer...

263
00:24:31,074 --> 00:24:32,491
Bloody chaos.

264
00:24:32,783 --> 00:24:35,408
Beer for us, cake for you.
- Excuse me..

265
00:24:36,449 --> 00:24:38,616
If you don't mind... you must leave.
- Why?

266
00:24:38,658 --> 00:24:41,991
Did someone tell you that we don't have money
or you think we'll dodge paying the bill?

267
00:24:42,033 --> 00:24:45,158
My owner thinks you are very noisy.
He's asking you to leave.

268
00:24:45,991 --> 00:24:49,616
If you think we are noisy, you must ask us
to lower our tone but not ask us to leave.

269
00:24:49,699 --> 00:24:51,491
How can you talk to us like that...

270
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:53,033
I'll see to it.
Come here...

271
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:54,199
Why are they still here?

272
00:24:54,324 --> 00:24:55,991
Sir, they are refusing to leave.

273
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:58,658
Refusing? Darn douche bags...

274
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:02,449
What do you think you guys are doing?

275
00:25:03,324 --> 00:25:06,616
Sir, today is my birthday.
My brother is throwing us a party..

276
00:25:06,658 --> 00:25:07,783
Please have some cake, sir.

277
00:25:07,866 --> 00:25:11,366
Why would I... as if you are a celebrity...

278
00:25:11,408 --> 00:25:13,658
Chanti...
Why are you hitting the little kid like that

279
00:25:14,824 --> 00:25:16,199
What are you blabbering?

280
00:25:16,408 --> 00:25:18,366
I will send them, sir..
- Leave immediately...

281
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:22,741
How dare you give me a back answer?
I'll kill you...

282
00:26:43,866 --> 00:26:46,949
You alone don't know
how to break a beer bottle.

283
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,033
Even I do.

284
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:56,824
If you are crazy, mad and other things alike...
show it in public..

285
00:26:56,908 --> 00:27:00,158
There are many people like you out there.

286
00:27:00,408 --> 00:27:03,158
I top that list...

287
00:27:03,283 --> 00:27:07,283
Things are good when in discipline,
If we miss discipline.

288
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:11,158
This is how it would be.

289
00:27:13,616 --> 00:27:17,824
Seshu has no idea who beat him up.
Kanna has no idea whom he beat up!

290
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:21,949
There's an unsaid relationship
between them now.

291
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,908
May I come in sir.

292
00:27:30,158 --> 00:27:32,991
Inquired in the bar...
they have no idea about them.

293
00:27:33,783 --> 00:27:38,783
Moreover they had cake smeared on their face...
it would be very difficult to identify

294
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,741
But one guy had a clear face...

295
00:27:41,949 --> 00:27:43,449
They can identify him¦

296
00:27:43,574 --> 00:27:46,783
We'll take the bar's staff
and look for that guy in Guntur...

297
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:49,116
But it will take some time..

298
00:27:49,783 --> 00:27:50,616
It's okay...

299
00:27:50,908 --> 00:27:53,616
You can leave.
- We'll find him at any cost...

300
00:27:55,283 --> 00:27:57,574
Don't struggle too hard...
carry on, Ramesh.

301
00:27:57,699 --> 00:27:58,866
Okay sir.

302
00:28:16,949 --> 00:28:20,699
The CI just spoke to me.
Bar staff can identify one guy...

303
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:23,991
Take him and look for that guy in Guntur.
what would be the size of Guntur...

304
00:28:25,158 --> 00:28:26,783
It's a small city.

305
00:28:26,949 --> 00:28:28,991
Maximum 15 kilometers surrounding...

306
00:28:34,741 --> 00:28:37,449
It won't take more than a month...

307
00:28:37,824 --> 00:28:38,908
Look, Alex...

308
00:28:39,241 --> 00:28:45,324
His death must be a mysterious example
in the history of crime.

309
00:28:45,366 --> 00:28:47,491
I like to kill people that way.

310
00:28:51,074 --> 00:28:58,033
We had to tell this to you because,
Kanna is madly is love with Seshu's sister.

311
00:28:59,324 --> 00:29:03,116
The moment I saw her...
I forgot everything else...

312
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,991
In that moment I forgot the world...

313
00:29:05,116 --> 00:29:10,074
I'll be blessed if I get her...

314
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:19,366
Wow.. well said, bro.
- Amazing, brother.

315
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:22,908
This is not from Facebook...

316
00:29:23,116 --> 00:29:26,741
These are my true feelings
in the form of a poem..

317
00:29:27,491 --> 00:29:29,408
You can't read Telugu properly...

318
00:29:29,616 --> 00:29:33,699
We finally understand the depth of your love
towards our sister.

319
00:29:33,908 --> 00:29:36,366
Sorry bro, we misunderstood you.

320
00:29:36,616 --> 00:29:38,741
No problem...
- You must get the girl...

321
00:29:38,908 --> 00:29:42,658
But for that we must find the girl...
- How... give me some ideas...

322
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:45,074
She's the friend of the girl
you met at the match making, right?

323
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:45,991
Yes...

324
00:29:46,574 --> 00:29:49,116
If we ask her, she'll give us her details.
It's that simple.

325
00:29:49,616 --> 00:29:52,949
He rejected that girl on her face.

326
00:29:53,074 --> 00:29:54,283
She'll beat him up if he asks for these details...

327
00:29:54,366 --> 00:29:57,783
Doesn't matter if she hits me. I need her details.
we don't have any other option.

328
00:29:58,033 --> 00:30:01,449
You have solved my problem in a way.

329
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:04,866
You have an amazing brain.
Your help won™t go waste...

330
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:07,824
I owe you for this...
- Oh... thanks.

331
00:30:08,366 --> 00:30:11,241
I'll surely do something for you...

332
00:30:12,241 --> 00:30:15,199
He will do something for me...

333
00:30:15,366 --> 00:30:18,533
I'll go find out more details aboutyour sister...

334
00:30:18,699 --> 00:30:19,866
All the best...
- Bye.

335
00:30:19,949 --> 00:30:22,408
What will he do to you!

336
00:30:28,783 --> 00:30:29,741
You?

337
00:30:30,283 --> 00:30:31,991
I didn't do it by mistake, sister.

338
00:30:32,283 --> 00:30:34,449
I really fell on your feet.

339
00:30:34,491 --> 00:30:37,158
Just because you didn't like me
that doesn't make me your sister...

340
00:30:37,616 --> 00:30:39,741
I can understand your anger...

341
00:30:39,991 --> 00:30:43,908
Bu I have a solid reason
to not have liked you..

342
00:30:43,949 --> 00:30:46,283
Did someone say that I have a bad character?

343
00:30:46,366 --> 00:30:47,991
No. Nothing like that...

344
00:30:48,033 --> 00:30:50,533
On that day beside you...

345
00:30:50,741 --> 00:30:56,033
I fell in love with your friend
who wore green and pink colored dress.

346
00:30:57,366 --> 00:30:59,449
I couldn't see her after that...

347
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:04,449
I was looking for her while my father
forced me to meet you...

348
00:31:04,741 --> 00:31:06,908
My mind was full of her...

349
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:10,158
While only my body was present...

350
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:14,366
Then I saw her there...

351
00:31:14,824 --> 00:31:18,199
If I get married to you
with some other girl in my heart,

352
00:31:18,824 --> 00:31:22,616
That would be morally, ethically
injustice to you, right?

353
00:31:24,033 --> 00:31:27,866
You still think I am wrong?
- Not at all...

354
00:31:28,408 --> 00:31:31,866
There are very few guys
who think so deeply.

355
00:31:31,949 --> 00:31:34,783
I'd like to askyou something
if you won't feel bad.

356
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:37,824
I am struggling to find out
details about that girl..

357
00:31:38,616 --> 00:31:41,824
If you can help me with that...

358
00:31:42,116 --> 00:31:47,033
you'd help in building our love.

359
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:51,033
I've no issues with that..
- Thanks...

360
00:31:51,158 --> 00:31:55,616
But I doubt if she will fall in love with you.

361
00:31:55,741 --> 00:31:58,491
Why? Did someone say that my character is bad?

362
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:02,574
I can imagine how bad you must have felt
about this.

363
00:32:02,783 --> 00:32:03,908
Don't feel bad.

364
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:06,783
He rejected you among so many people,

365
00:32:06,949 --> 00:32:11,408
He lacks no common sense.
Consider yourself lucky to not have him in your life.

366
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:12,824
Think positive.

367
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:16,658
An ill mannered guy like that
will never find a girl.

368
00:32:16,741 --> 00:32:24,824
A worse, useless guy like that
will never get married this lifetime.

369
00:32:26,116 --> 00:32:28,991
Do you think she'll love you?

370
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:30,241
It's difficult...

371
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:34,658
But I will tell her the value of my love

372
00:32:35,741 --> 00:32:39,699
No harm in trying...
just bachelorhood status will change.

373
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,658
Okay, all the best...

374
00:32:42,033 --> 00:32:44,741
Her name is Amrutha.
Her brother Seshu is a lawyer

375
00:32:45,074 --> 00:32:46,241
They live in Vidyanagar.

376
00:32:46,449 --> 00:32:47,491
Amrutha...

377
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,033
Please don™t tell her that
I gave you her details.

378
00:32:50,241 --> 00:32:51,741
She'll kill me
if she finds out.

379
00:32:52,408 --> 00:32:55,408
Please don't tell her that
I took her details from you.

380
00:32:55,533 --> 00:32:57,408
Okay, bye.
- Bye.

381
00:32:57,908 --> 00:33:00,783
Amu... I am coming.

382
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:25,658
Lord, please see to it that no evil forces follow me
and all goes well.

383
00:33:28,949 --> 00:33:30,491
I didn't like the girl.

384
00:33:30,616 --> 00:33:32,241
Why is he here?

385
00:33:34,658 --> 00:33:35,574
What?

386
00:33:36,491 --> 00:33:38,033
I didn't come to the temple.

387
00:33:39,158 --> 00:33:41,283
I came to talk with you.
- For what?

388
00:33:41,908 --> 00:33:47,533
To apologize for rejecting Divya
among so many people?

389
00:33:47,699 --> 00:33:49,033
You want me to say that to her?

390
00:33:49,116 --> 00:33:51,616
Are you shameless?
I will never listen to you.

391
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,616
Lord Shiva... if she didn't listen to this...

392
00:33:57,949 --> 00:33:59,449
She'll kill me if I propose.

393
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:00,949
Please help, Shiva.

394
00:34:04,324 --> 00:34:05,408
God is great.

395
00:34:08,491 --> 00:34:10,449
I am not here for that...
- Then?

396
00:34:11,408 --> 00:34:13,283
At that match making ceremony...

397
00:34:13,908 --> 00:34:15,324
At that match making ceremony?

398
00:34:16,491 --> 00:34:19,116
When I saw you...
- What happened?

399
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:21,824
My friend fell in love with you
when he saw you..

400
00:34:23,908 --> 00:34:25,408
Please don't look at me like that,
its freaking me out.

401
00:34:25,991 --> 00:34:28,824
My friend is a shy guy..

402
00:34:29,116 --> 00:34:32,408
Since he couldn't confess his love,
he sent me to you.

403
00:34:32,908 --> 00:34:36,533
I'll break him apart. Let him know.

404
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,699
But he loves you sincerely.

405
00:34:40,783 --> 00:34:42,741
Are you a broker?

406
00:34:43,158 --> 00:34:46,158
I am his friend. I am the type
who would do anything for a friend.

407
00:34:46,658 --> 00:34:49,658
I am helping him to achieve his love.

408
00:34:49,741 --> 00:34:52,033
Never mind that.
Tell your friend...

409
00:34:52,283 --> 00:34:55,741
Not to have such kind of hopes from me
- I already told him...

410
00:34:56,074 --> 00:34:58,574
It's madness to fall in love at first sight...

411
00:34:59,324 --> 00:35:03,074
But he doesn't listen...
and those poems and songs about you...

412
00:35:03,283 --> 00:35:05,283
Our ears are bleeding...

413
00:35:05,741 --> 00:35:11,449
He is smoking like a chimney
and is not letting us sleep at night... Idiot.

414
00:35:11,574 --> 00:35:14,574
Oh so, he smokes...

415
00:35:15,074 --> 00:35:15,908
Why?

416
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,533
I hate smokers.

417
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,658
Oh.. so what..
I'll tell him to quit smoking...

418
00:35:20,783 --> 00:35:22,449
That you don't like smokers...

419
00:35:22,574 --> 00:35:24,574
Can't he sacrifice that for your love..

420
00:35:24,699 --> 00:35:26,033
He will quit...
I'll tell him..

421
00:35:26,116 --> 00:35:28,741
I don't care if he smokes or not.

422
00:35:28,866 --> 00:35:31,949
Ask him to stop loving me.
- Okay.

423
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:37,049
Whom did you put in a fix?
- Suspense.. I'll tell you when time comes.

424
00:35:37,258 --> 00:35:38,758
Don't worry. Be brave!

425
00:35:38,841 --> 00:35:40,924
My foot... I freak out
when if comes to the ladies.

426
00:35:41,924 --> 00:35:44,133
You guys can't help my love directly.

427
00:35:44,299 --> 00:35:47,049
At least be of some help indirectly.
- Ok bro.

428
00:35:47,174 --> 00:35:49,258
We want nothing more
than your successful love story.

429
00:35:49,341 --> 00:35:51,299
We'll be useful...
- Have a smoke.

430
00:35:52,091 --> 00:35:53,883
No. I quit smoking.

431
00:35:54,633 --> 00:35:57,216
You can't do without smoking, right?

432
00:35:57,424 --> 00:35:59,258
Your sister will kill me.

433
00:35:59,508 --> 00:36:01,424
Oh...
- See you.

434
00:36:01,633 --> 00:36:02,674
Greetings sir...
- Greetings.

435
00:36:02,799 --> 00:36:05,216
What is your boss doing?
- He's inside.

436
00:36:11,174 --> 00:36:15,133
Why are you sitting in such dull light?
I spoke to the CM.

437
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:21,258
He's gave us an appointment for next week.
We must confirm and talk to him.

438
00:36:22,591 --> 00:36:24,508
Why aren't you speaking?

439
00:36:25,591 --> 00:36:27,966
Is this for him?

440
00:36:28,008 --> 00:36:29,841
Where will he go?
You'll find him.

441
00:36:29,924 --> 00:36:33,799
But such things must be taken lightly.
now seat is more important...

442
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:42,258
Hello, sir..
- What™s the progress, Alex?

443
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:46,383
We looked at surrounding areas
public spaces and main center..

444
00:36:46,674 --> 00:36:47,966
Search fast...

445
00:36:48,466 --> 00:36:51,091
His death shouldn't be normal...

446
00:36:51,549 --> 00:36:53,924
I'll look forward for you to kill him.

447
00:36:54,508 --> 00:36:56,883
King kong...
Look everywhere in the colony...

448
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:59,758
Tell me when you find your sister Amrutha
- Ok brother...

449
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:01,508
Ask him to leave...
- You can eat later go... go.

450
00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:18,924
Basha, he needs a lighter...
- Ok brother.

451
00:37:19,216 --> 00:37:22,008
You feel happy with his death...

452
00:37:22,299 --> 00:37:23,549
That's my promise.

453
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:29,174
The file will be closed if you sign here

454
00:37:30,341 --> 00:37:31,674
One minute Alex...
- Ok sir.

455
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:32,591
What?

456
00:37:33,299 --> 00:37:35,841
When there is an important meeting going on...
you should knock the door..

457
00:37:35,883 --> 00:37:38,633
You should ask 'May I com in please.'
don't you know that.

458
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:41,466
Don't you know that...

459
00:37:42,008 --> 00:37:43,008
Go.
- Sir...

460
00:37:46,883 --> 00:37:48,008
May I come in sir?

461
00:37:48,424 --> 00:37:49,174
Come in.

462
00:37:58,633 --> 00:38:01,091
Alex... don't relax.

463
00:38:01,716 --> 00:38:04,174
Take this very seriously...
- Ok sir.

464
00:38:07,258 --> 00:38:09,549
There is fun in your friendship...

465
00:38:09,924 --> 00:38:12,216
But very bad with enemies...

466
00:38:13,008 --> 00:38:14,299
What is this?

467
00:38:14,424 --> 00:38:19,549
He is some young guy...
he doesn't know about us...

468
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:21,466
Such a mess for that?

469
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,883
I can't leave him so easily...

470
00:38:25,216 --> 00:38:26,758
Till he dies.

471
00:38:27,633 --> 00:38:28,633
Wow.

472
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:33,716
See you...
- Bye.

473
00:38:35,341 --> 00:38:36,299
Good morning.

474
00:38:36,924 --> 00:38:38,466
Why did you come again?

475
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:41,341
I told him that you don't like smoking...

476
00:38:41,591 --> 00:38:44,591
He quit smoking immediately
after I told him.

477
00:38:45,716 --> 00:38:49,674
For the sake of love...
would anyone leave such a old habit?

478
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:53,924
His love is very great.

479
00:38:54,008 --> 00:38:56,424
Tell him I don't love him.

480
00:38:56,508 --> 00:38:59,091
I don't care if he smokes or quits...

481
00:38:59,508 --> 00:39:01,549
Don't irritate me...
- I told him the same.

482
00:39:01,591 --> 00:39:05,466
That you wouldn't love him...
And not to keep hopes on you.

483
00:39:05,508 --> 00:39:07,258
Do you know what he said...

484
00:39:07,341 --> 00:39:10,383
Love is not a habit to quit...

485
00:39:10,633 --> 00:39:14,466
It is something great
It come from bottom of the heart...

486
00:39:14,841 --> 00:39:19,049
He said I'll quit smoking...
but I can't stop loving that girl...

487
00:39:19,216 --> 00:39:22,091
He told me about many things...
- So what are saying.

488
00:39:22,174 --> 00:39:25,299
He smokes around five cigarettes everyday...

489
00:39:25,508 --> 00:39:27,841
He smokes around five packets while drunk...

490
00:39:28,091 --> 00:39:31,341
But yesterday night...
after drinking around 10 beers...

491
00:39:31,508 --> 00:39:33,883
He didn't touch a cigarette...

492
00:39:35,758 --> 00:39:38,008
So he drinks?

493
00:39:38,633 --> 00:39:39,841
You don't like drinking?

494
00:39:40,716 --> 00:39:41,758
I hate drinkers.

495
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:46,049
Cooling is great bro...
Have it.

496
00:39:47,299 --> 00:39:50,924
how do you drink it these beers...
cooling, gas and bad taste.

497
00:39:51,049 --> 00:39:52,466
Useless fellow.

498
00:39:56,383 --> 00:39:58,591
it is going down the throat greatly

499
00:39:58,758 --> 00:40:01,633
Nothing can beat this taste.
- Drink... drink...

500
00:40:03,466 --> 00:40:04,924
What is this great change in you?

501
00:40:05,008 --> 00:40:08,883
That is, your sister hates those drinking...

502
00:40:09,799 --> 00:40:12,674
You are sacrificing too much
for a girl not sure to fall in love

503
00:40:13,633 --> 00:40:17,008
I will do anything for Amrutha...

504
00:40:17,466 --> 00:40:21,174
We are ignorant bro...
- We could not recognize the great lover in you,

505
00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:24,091
Ok, he won't drink anyway.
let us drink

506
00:40:25,091 --> 00:40:26,758
I gave up drinking...

507
00:40:30,924 --> 00:40:32,883
Understood, we also should not drink.

508
00:40:34,591 --> 00:40:37,508
We had a great time last night...
it was a blast.

509
00:40:38,174 --> 00:40:40,549
Who is drinking there?
get out...

510
00:40:41,049 --> 00:40:43,466
What is bothering you...
when we are drinking here.

511
00:40:44,091 --> 00:40:49,299
I am saying not to drink
Why do say why for me, idiot?

512
00:40:49,549 --> 00:40:50,466
He is gone.

513
00:41:04,133 --> 00:41:06,716
Brother is busy thinking about sister...

514
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:08,758
We'll handle this.

515
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,133
Hold it...
- Bro...

516
00:41:17,091 --> 00:41:19,883
Why are you hitting him unnecessarily?
Let him go...

517
00:41:20,174 --> 00:41:23,133
What do you care boss...
Go do your work.

518
00:41:23,299 --> 00:41:26,674
I'm not the type to be calm when so much
is happening in front of my eyes.

519
00:41:26,924 --> 00:41:28,841
I am a guy to mess with it, let him go

520
00:41:29,174 --> 00:41:31,383
Don't unnecessarily get into this boss, go

521
00:41:32,674 --> 00:41:36,216
Hey, if I get into something
that means I need it

522
00:41:36,299 --> 00:41:38,758
You look like a swollen ox,
don't you get it?

523
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,841
He hit you hard...

524
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:53,383
Shall we go to the hospital?

525
00:41:57,091 --> 00:41:58,049
Oh no...

526
00:41:58,508 --> 00:42:01,091
Bro.. You know what happened there?

527
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:02,674
I know...

528
00:42:03,466 --> 00:42:05,508
He hit you badly...
- You know that?

529
00:42:05,758 --> 00:42:09,591
Even after knowing, you didn't help me...

530
00:42:09,966 --> 00:42:12,508
I went to him with a confidence
that you are here.

531
00:42:13,133 --> 00:42:14,508
Why didn't you come?

532
00:42:15,758 --> 00:42:18,924
When I am asking here,
why do you turn your head...

533
00:42:23,633 --> 00:42:27,758
That means... has sister said
she hate all these fights?

534
00:42:28,341 --> 00:42:29,841
I hate street fight.

535
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,674
What love is this bro? darn love!

536
00:42:33,716 --> 00:42:36,383
Make a list of things she doesn't like
and stop everything at once.

537
00:42:36,466 --> 00:42:39,799
What are these installments,
I am getting rotten here.

538
00:42:40,008 --> 00:42:42,091
Still, no use giving up all she hates.

539
00:42:42,216 --> 00:42:45,508
If you give what sister likes,
she gets impressed.

540
00:42:45,591 --> 00:42:46,591
Your love would be a success.

541
00:42:46,966 --> 00:42:47,924
Bro...

542
00:42:48,174 --> 00:42:48,883
Bro...

543
00:42:49,424 --> 00:42:51,549
Your brains isn't an ordinary one.

544
00:42:51,758 --> 00:42:53,633
Genius...

545
00:42:53,883 --> 00:42:57,299
I will not let you go empty
for giving such a great idea.

546
00:42:57,674 --> 00:42:58,758
I can't keep it.

547
00:42:58,924 --> 00:43:00,299
I will put this in my account.
- Go on, Yes

548
00:43:00,341 --> 00:43:02,841
I will do something for him...
- It seems, bro will do something to me

549
00:43:05,591 --> 00:43:10,424
I will be on the job
to know what your sister likes.

550
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:12,924
Let us meet again, bye...
- Bye...

551
00:43:15,883 --> 00:43:19,008
Kanna is keeping calm these days
not getting into any fights

552
00:43:19,091 --> 00:43:21,008
Yes...
- That is what I wanted all these days.

553
00:43:21,049 --> 00:43:22,424
I am very happy...

554
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:25,508
Youngsters of this generation
have a full clarity on life.

555
00:43:25,591 --> 00:43:27,966
They know till when to be mischievous
and when to be responsible.

556
00:43:28,049 --> 00:43:30,008
We don't need to worry at all.

557
00:43:30,091 --> 00:43:32,633
We were naughty guys while studying...

558
00:43:32,674 --> 00:43:35,508
It makes us very happy
when we think of those days.

559
00:43:35,633 --> 00:43:38,299
Suri was our gang leader those days...
- Yes...

560
00:43:38,341 --> 00:43:40,508
It was a great courage
when he was beside us.

561
00:43:40,591 --> 00:43:42,591
Our entire batch has settled well.

562
00:43:42,633 --> 00:43:44,424
One in job, one in business,

563
00:43:44,508 --> 00:43:46,966
One in politics¦
all are in good positions.

564
00:43:47,049 --> 00:43:50,299
We are no less...
we are happy with our lifes...

565
00:43:50,383 --> 00:43:51,299
Hey Suri...

566
00:43:51,508 --> 00:43:53,216
You didn't change at all.

567
00:43:53,341 --> 00:43:56,341
Without depending on anyone...
to live great in what we have.

568
00:43:56,758 --> 00:43:58,508
They should learn from you.

569
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,716
Why such big dialogues...

570
00:44:00,841 --> 00:44:05,466
We have met here for a time pass right?
Come on enjoy...

571
00:44:13,966 --> 00:44:17,299
If you say about Amrutha likes and her habits are,
I will go on...

572
00:44:17,466 --> 00:44:20,424
She loves pets and is crazy about lotus...

573
00:44:25,258 --> 00:44:27,299
Hey Sweety, you should do me a help.

574
00:44:27,508 --> 00:44:30,008
There, that angle coming in Pink dress.

575
00:44:30,341 --> 00:44:32,716
She is your sister-in-law.
You should near her and stop

576
00:44:33,133 --> 00:44:35,133
She likes your breed a lot.

577
00:44:35,383 --> 00:44:38,008
She would take you home
and take care of you happily...

578
00:44:38,091 --> 00:44:42,924
Hey, if you come back home by mistake saying
to have remembered your dad being home sick

579
00:44:43,091 --> 00:44:44,424
I will hit you on the back.

580
00:44:44,508 --> 00:44:48,883
Because many animals like doves and snakes...

581
00:44:49,049 --> 00:44:51,091
All such breeds sacrificed a lot
for love in the past.

582
00:44:51,174 --> 00:44:54,299
Coming to that matter,
yours is in no way a sacrifice,

583
00:44:54,508 --> 00:44:56,216
But just a separation.

584
00:44:56,508 --> 00:44:57,341
You know why?

585
00:44:57,424 --> 00:45:01,133
Because me and your sister-in-law
are going to marry in a few days.

586
00:45:01,341 --> 00:45:04,758
Then, you can get into the lap of her
and come back home immediately.

587
00:45:06,341 --> 00:45:08,591
They say dogs are the reflections of loyalty.

588
00:45:08,883 --> 00:45:11,716
The time has come to prove your loyalty...

589
00:45:11,966 --> 00:45:14,049
Go dog and prove your loyalty.

590
00:45:14,258 --> 00:45:15,883
Go, my dear short dog.

591
00:45:21,174 --> 00:45:23,008
Wow... So cute...

592
00:45:27,799 --> 00:45:29,383
Why is nobody here?

593
00:45:34,258 --> 00:45:35,216
Whom do you think this belongs?

594
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:38,133
Anyways you like pets, right?
Take it home...

595
00:45:38,216 --> 00:45:39,341
I like it...

596
00:45:39,633 --> 00:45:43,008
Say if you don't want,
I will take it home.

597
00:45:43,258 --> 00:45:45,508
No, I will take it home.

598
00:45:57,299 --> 00:45:59,799
Why are you sad, dad?
Did you remember mom?

599
00:46:04,966 --> 00:46:08,883
My cutie pie!
Someone stole my stress buster.

600
00:46:09,883 --> 00:46:11,466
Leave it dad,
we will find it.

601
00:46:12,341 --> 00:46:14,591
It was my life...
Why do you say not to worry?

602
00:46:15,049 --> 00:46:16,508
I took care of it like my daughter.

603
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:19,258
I thought it would cover up the pain
of not having girl child.

604
00:46:19,341 --> 00:46:21,841
Some bloody idiot, rascal,

605
00:46:22,174 --> 00:46:24,883
Fool has stolen it from me.

606
00:46:24,966 --> 00:46:26,633
It would be found, don't scold.

607
00:46:27,258 --> 00:46:29,716
Hey, why do you say not scold that thief.
- Bloody thief...

608
00:46:30,591 --> 00:46:32,799
Hey, go to the Police station immediately...

609
00:46:33,008 --> 00:46:35,216
Give a complaint saying my cutie is missing

610
00:46:35,841 --> 00:46:38,424
What can the Police do?
waste of time.

611
00:46:38,674 --> 00:46:39,508
I am here, right?

612
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:42,966
Our cutie will back home exactly in three months.
- Three months?

613
00:46:43,049 --> 00:46:44,716
How could you say so correct?

614
00:46:44,799 --> 00:46:47,216
That is, unable to see your pain¦

615
00:46:47,383 --> 00:46:49,091
Kanna... what did you say?
- Dad...

616
00:46:49,341 --> 00:46:51,091
You could not see me
going through this...

617
00:47:05,091 --> 00:47:07,216
Wow! Cute,
it is so cute.

618
00:47:07,258 --> 00:47:09,424
You like pets?
- I like them a lot...

619
00:47:09,883 --> 00:47:12,883
Hey, even our idiot loves pets a lot.

620
00:47:12,924 --> 00:47:14,716
Tastes of you both are same to same.

621
00:47:16,049 --> 00:47:18,133
Actually this pet is not mine.

622
00:47:18,799 --> 00:47:20,216
I found it.

623
00:47:20,466 --> 00:47:24,466
This is not the one sent by your friend, right?
- No, it cannot be so.

624
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:27,841
If he has to give anything to you,
I am the mediator right?

625
00:47:27,924 --> 00:47:31,133
Will he get direct without me knowing that?
- As far as I know, he wouldn't do that...

626
00:47:31,424 --> 00:47:34,341
Because he has great trust over me.

627
00:47:34,799 --> 00:47:37,716
Somehow, I have great doubts on this.

628
00:47:39,049 --> 00:47:40,591
Ask your friend to come once.

629
00:47:40,716 --> 00:47:42,883
He fears a lot, poor guy.
He will not come at all.

630
00:47:42,966 --> 00:47:44,008
I am anyways here, right?

631
00:47:44,216 --> 00:47:46,883
Don't over act,
he is the one in love with me right?

632
00:47:47,091 --> 00:47:49,008
Yes, it's him.
for sure¦

633
00:47:49,758 --> 00:47:50,674
Then ask him to come...

634
00:47:51,508 --> 00:47:52,424
That is it?

635
00:47:54,299 --> 00:47:55,466
Don't be afraid brothers...

636
00:47:55,633 --> 00:47:58,924
I am giving the chance to play a lover
to one from you.

637
00:47:59,258 --> 00:48:00,299
Make a good use of it.

638
00:48:00,424 --> 00:48:01,549
Come on...
- No.

639
00:48:01,591 --> 00:48:04,966
I know that you will not come.
- That is why I will choose the lucky one.

640
00:48:13,716 --> 00:48:16,091
What a beautiful face¦
It's you...

641
00:48:16,258 --> 00:48:17,258
Come...

642
00:48:17,299 --> 00:48:18,049
I won't come.

643
00:48:18,174 --> 00:48:21,508
I will not leave you, do something to you,
will put in your account and will repay you¦

644
00:48:21,633 --> 00:48:24,549
Thought something else...
I never thought you would backstab me

645
00:48:24,883 --> 00:48:25,591
I won't come...

646
00:48:25,674 --> 00:48:27,258
Don't fear bro, nothing will happen.

647
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:28,549
How is it possible?

648
00:48:28,799 --> 00:48:32,549
I always commented girls from far
but have never seen them from close till now.

649
00:48:32,633 --> 00:48:34,508
I am going still, I cannot handle.

650
00:48:34,591 --> 00:48:36,549
Not just the limbs, but nothing works.

651
00:48:36,633 --> 00:48:39,508
You were backing up his love
from the beginning...

652
00:48:39,591 --> 00:48:41,883
You deserve this... Go and settle it now.

653
00:48:48,466 --> 00:48:49,508
Is that you?

654
00:48:49,883 --> 00:48:52,716
Are you the eternal lover
so sincerely in love with me?

655
00:48:53,674 --> 00:48:54,466
Yes madam...

656
00:48:55,549 --> 00:49:00,216
Seeing at your face and personality,
you don't look like a sincere lover.

657
00:49:00,799 --> 00:49:03,674
What exactly is the relation between
a sincere lover, face and personality.

658
00:49:03,799 --> 00:49:06,674
Still you know, I am a very dedicated
and sincere lover.

659
00:49:06,841 --> 00:49:08,299
Oh... really?

660
00:49:08,924 --> 00:49:11,383
Come close to me once...

661
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:14,341
Will she give a kiss?

662
00:49:14,674 --> 00:49:16,674
Oh no, I should have brushed in the morning

663
00:49:17,341 --> 00:49:19,008
Kanna would feel bad...

664
00:49:23,924 --> 00:49:24,841
Why did you slap me?

665
00:49:25,008 --> 00:49:27,549
Enough of your crying.
Go call him...

666
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,133
Whom?

667
00:49:30,174 --> 00:49:32,008
That same fellow...
- Who is that madam?

668
00:49:32,258 --> 00:49:33,174
Kanna...

669
00:49:34,883 --> 00:49:35,883
You know it?

670
00:49:36,799 --> 00:49:38,924
He is sincerely in love with you madam.

671
00:49:39,174 --> 00:49:41,174
Anyways all good has happened.

672
00:49:41,299 --> 00:49:44,758
You know I am a good guy and decent guy...
- Ok, why are you saying it to me

673
00:49:45,174 --> 00:49:49,466
I mean, you can guess about knowing
one friend from the group. There is a quotation...

674
00:49:49,508 --> 00:49:52,591
So... you can judge him as a good guy
and love him happily.

675
00:49:53,549 --> 00:49:54,424
Really?

676
00:49:55,883 --> 00:49:56,716
Why did you hit again?

677
00:49:56,799 --> 00:49:59,049
Why can't I judge you seeing him?

678
00:49:59,383 --> 00:50:02,008
That you are a fool and idiot like him¦

679
00:50:02,133 --> 00:50:04,174
Don't give all idiotic logics and send him.

680
00:50:06,591 --> 00:50:08,716
You are very intelligent madam.
- Thanks.

681
00:50:08,841 --> 00:50:10,008
She hit very hard.

682
00:50:12,466 --> 00:50:13,383
Are you frightened?

683
00:50:13,466 --> 00:50:15,508
I am getting tensed dude...
I am going still

684
00:50:16,424 --> 00:50:19,216
Everything will get work automatically
once you go there.

685
00:50:19,299 --> 00:50:21,216
Be brave. Go.

686
00:50:23,716 --> 00:50:24,299
Come...

687
00:50:29,383 --> 00:50:30,799
How did you get to know?

688
00:50:31,299 --> 00:50:34,549
As you have falling behind me regularly,
I got a doubt...

689
00:50:34,758 --> 00:50:36,133
Asked Divya seriously.

690
00:50:36,174 --> 00:50:39,716
I myself said as he said serious and sincere.
Sorry Amrutha.

691
00:50:40,299 --> 00:50:41,258
Thanks...

692
00:50:41,508 --> 00:50:44,924
But mine is not acting. Sincere love.

693
00:50:45,299 --> 00:50:50,216
Seeing your fantastic performance
I was addicted and didn't ask though I knew.

694
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:55,008
I let you continue as the concept was good
and also that you were entertaining me.

695
00:50:55,216 --> 00:50:57,633
Because giving anything is easy,

696
00:50:58,174 --> 00:51:00,674
Enough to spend money and time,

697
00:51:01,508 --> 00:51:04,924
But letting go anything we like
is very difficult.

698
00:51:05,424 --> 00:51:08,633
Sacrifice! That is in you.
- Thank you.

699
00:51:09,008 --> 00:51:11,466
That means you love me right?

700
00:51:11,633 --> 00:51:13,299
No..

701
00:51:13,924 --> 00:51:17,049
This is life here
and we cannot commit so easily.

702
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:18,841
Go do your work...

703
00:51:19,883 --> 00:51:23,633
Hello, I will give my life for love. Promise.

704
00:51:47,966 --> 00:51:54,633
"Will place you on the head, will hide in the heart
Will take care of you like an angel¦ Promise"

705
00:51:55,424 --> 00:52:02,049
"Becoming a tattoo for hundred years
will be with you¦ Promise"

706
00:52:02,924 --> 00:52:09,758
"I will write love a billion times...
If I love¦ Promise"

707
00:52:10,341 --> 00:52:17,133
"My eyelid blinks seeing you
I cannot be without you¦ Promise"

708
00:52:17,674 --> 00:52:21,424
"Heart beat changed like your name"

709
00:52:21,549 --> 00:52:25,383
"Either tear, cut, kill or bury"

710
00:52:25,466 --> 00:52:28,966
"I will not leave you dear,
you are my Barbie doll"

711
00:52:29,049 --> 00:52:32,758
"Scratch or stamp over me,
or throw me into river"

712
00:52:32,924 --> 00:52:36,508
"I will never forget you, you are my sparkle"

713
00:52:59,174 --> 00:53:02,799
"Life without you cannot even be thought of"

714
00:53:02,924 --> 00:53:06,383
"I can't breathe, what to do?"

715
00:53:06,591 --> 00:53:10,383
"The only life I have
is dedicated it to you"

716
00:53:10,466 --> 00:53:14,008
Why to live if you say no?

717
00:53:14,174 --> 00:53:20,966
"If you throw a small smile
I will fly into skies like a rocket"

718
00:53:21,674 --> 00:53:28,633
"Don't reject with eyes,
I will fall down like a star on to earth"

719
00:53:29,174 --> 00:53:32,674
"Whenever you come,
it is then a festival for me"

720
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:36,383
"Either tear, cut, kill or bury"

721
00:53:36,633 --> 00:53:39,924
"I will not leave you dear, you are my Barbie doll"

722
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:43,966
"Scratch or stamp over me,
or throw me into river"

723
00:53:44,174 --> 00:53:47,716
"I will never forget you, you are my sparkle"

724
00:54:17,383 --> 00:54:21,674
"Love will be as much as the anger that exists"

725
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:25,216
"Nothing wrong, get angry as much you need"

726
00:54:25,424 --> 00:54:29,174
"Closeness comes as we go far away"

727
00:54:29,258 --> 00:54:32,174
"Go far if you want to make it true"

728
00:54:32,883 --> 00:54:39,383
"Those two eyes...
to meet with two more eyes"

729
00:54:40,466 --> 00:54:46,924
"Why is there one heart
To give that with love to another heart"

730
00:54:47,924 --> 00:54:51,299
"Don't act stubborn like you don't know"

731
00:54:51,674 --> 00:54:55,299
"Either tear, cut, kill or bury"

732
00:54:55,466 --> 00:54:58,799
"I will not leave you dear,
you are my Barbie doll"

733
00:54:59,049 --> 00:55:02,799
"Scratch or stamp over me,
or throw me into river"

734
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:06,508
"I will never forget you, you are my sparkle"

735
00:55:08,174 --> 00:55:10,841
Ammu, you still don't believe in my love?

736
00:55:13,049 --> 00:55:14,299
Tomorrow is my birthday.

737
00:55:14,924 --> 00:55:17,299
Meet me and wish me.

738
00:55:17,674 --> 00:55:19,466
I will think about you in the night...

739
00:55:20,008 --> 00:55:22,633
Suppose, if I feel like trusting you,

740
00:55:23,424 --> 00:55:25,299
I will propose you.

741
00:55:26,216 --> 00:55:27,966
If not, I will say thank you.

742
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:29,591
Ok bye.

743
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:35,049
You girls would never say anything straight.

744
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:37,799
You kill us making hang in the middle heaven.

745
00:55:39,216 --> 00:55:40,591
Gods must be crazy.

746
00:55:42,466 --> 00:55:44,216
Files must go...
- Ok sir.

747
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,966
Hello, it is me.

748
00:55:46,091 --> 00:55:49,382
It seems CM came to Hyderabad,
he gave an appointment for tomorrow.

749
00:55:49,632 --> 00:55:50,841
Hyderabad right?

750
00:55:51,716 --> 00:55:54,924
No need of flight,
we shall happily go early morning in car.

751
00:55:55,424 --> 00:55:57,466
It would also be comfortable for me to smoke

752
00:55:57,549 --> 00:56:00,049
Oh, you need to smoke...

753
00:56:00,382 --> 00:56:01,882
Ok, we'll go by road.
- Ok.

754
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:11,424
Hi brother...

755
00:56:13,091 --> 00:56:15,591
Wish you a very happy birthday.
- Thank you brother

756
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:21,257
Amrutha, I have a very important meeting with CM.

757
00:56:21,341 --> 00:56:25,257
Sorry, I can't be there for your celebrations
- It's ok brother... That is an important work.

758
00:56:32,216 --> 00:56:33,091
Hello...

759
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:35,966
Sir we found him.

760
00:56:39,424 --> 00:56:42,466
I know the person
who hit you the other day.

761
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:45,007
I am going to him now...

762
00:56:45,591 --> 00:56:47,382
Ok, good job.

763
00:56:47,591 --> 00:56:48,757
I will call you back.

764
00:56:49,966 --> 00:56:52,882
Amrutha, I heard a good news
on your birthday.

765
00:56:53,841 --> 00:56:56,049
I found one thing for which
I had been waiting for long.

766
00:56:56,424 --> 00:56:59,799
I am very happy today...
Happy birthday once again.

767
00:57:01,007 --> 00:57:03,549
Ok brother, happy journey.
- Thank you

768
00:57:08,382 --> 00:57:10,132
Hey, start the vehicle.

769
00:57:26,591 --> 00:57:29,257
Sir, that's him. That's him sir...

770
00:57:30,299 --> 00:57:31,591
Follow that guy...

771
00:58:18,674 --> 00:58:20,841
Wish you a happy birthday Amu.

772
00:58:29,007 --> 00:58:32,924
I wish to give the same happiness
in your face life long.

773
00:58:37,507 --> 00:58:39,549
I love you dear.

774
00:58:52,591 --> 00:58:54,632
Alex, did you find him?
- Yes sir, I found him.

775
00:58:57,174 --> 00:59:00,841
He is in romance with some girl.
- Push her and finish him.

776
00:59:02,007 --> 00:59:04,382
Kill that fellow
and send his pictures on WhatsApp

777
00:59:07,174 --> 00:59:10,007
I thought a lot about you yesterday night.

778
00:59:10,091 --> 00:59:13,882
But came here blank
without taking any decision.

779
00:59:14,174 --> 00:59:17,674
But, I fell for that one statement you told me.

780
00:59:19,216 --> 00:59:23,674
Any girl would expect the same
from the guy she would like to marry.

781
00:59:25,174 --> 00:59:27,091
Really... I love you.

782
00:59:27,299 --> 00:59:32,549
Kanna, I'll meet you later...
My sister-in-law would be waiting for me. Bye

783
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:05,882
Why is he dancing like a mad guy?

784
01:00:06,091 --> 01:00:10,882
Killing him now, he would die
without knowing that fact,

785
01:00:11,632 --> 01:00:13,216
Lucky fellow...

786
01:01:14,591 --> 01:01:19,466
My hands itch a lot
and I had actually stopped everything for love.

787
01:01:19,799 --> 01:01:23,549
Why are you guys scratching me?

788
01:01:23,841 --> 01:01:26,132
I'll rage if you do so...

789
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:29,299
I will get heated up if I rage...

790
01:01:29,507 --> 01:01:33,424
You will have it bad
if I get heated up.

791
01:03:07,882 --> 01:03:11,716
Hello sir!
Can I see your beautiful face once?

792
01:03:12,716 --> 01:03:15,799
Oh no, who are you?
You look like son of Mukesh Rishi.

793
01:03:15,899 --> 01:03:17,924
Sir... sir...

794
01:03:18,424 --> 01:03:21,424
Who are you
and why did you come to hit me?

795
01:03:24,341 --> 01:03:29,466
I hit them badly...
Someone please tell me... sir.

796
01:03:33,882 --> 01:03:36,882
What kind of phone is this,
working even in such a heavy rain?

797
01:03:41,632 --> 01:03:43,091
Hello...

798
01:03:43,632 --> 01:03:45,466
What happened Alex?
Have you finished him?

799
01:03:47,841 --> 01:03:51,049
Who are you dear,
shivering so in anger

800
01:03:51,632 --> 01:03:54,716
How can they finish me...
I finished them.

801
01:03:58,007 --> 01:04:00,966
Aren't you dead, rascal.
- Hey...

802
01:04:01,257 --> 01:04:04,757
I am in a happy mood
as my love is a success,

803
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:09,341
why are you asking like am I dead,
have they killed and so on?

804
01:04:09,507 --> 01:04:15,132
Still what was such a great sin or crime
for me to die?

805
01:04:15,216 --> 01:04:17,382
You hit me.

806
01:04:17,507 --> 01:04:21,507
I hit many people from my childhood dear,
who are you dear?

807
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:24,007
Nagarjuna grand night 11:30,

808
01:04:24,091 --> 01:04:27,674
Did you forget birthday of that kid, you rascal.

809
01:04:27,799 --> 01:04:30,841
Oh, are you that crazy idiot?

810
01:04:30,924 --> 01:04:35,174
Keeping that in mind
you sent so many to kill me

811
01:04:35,341 --> 01:04:37,799
You are not any ordinary person.

812
01:04:37,882 --> 01:04:40,257
Yes, I am not an ordinary person.

813
01:04:40,341 --> 01:04:43,341
Seshu, criminal lawyer Seshu.

814
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:47,882
Her brother is Seshu, criminal lawyer.

815
01:04:49,091 --> 01:04:52,799
People fear listening to my name in Guntur.

816
01:04:52,882 --> 01:04:56,174
You hit me and moving around happily

817
01:04:56,507 --> 01:04:59,799
I put men to search you like a mad guy.

818
01:05:00,257 --> 01:05:06,257
Hey, do not celebrate for escaping now.
- Your death is for sure.

819
01:05:06,507 --> 01:05:10,632
Sorry sir, it happened unknowingly.

820
01:05:11,382 --> 01:05:12,424
Please forget about it sir.

821
01:05:12,507 --> 01:05:15,924
How can I forget about it?
- You did a big mistake.

822
01:05:16,216 --> 01:05:19,966
You should die crying badly
for messing with me.

823
01:05:20,632 --> 01:05:24,757
Sorry sir, I am saying right?
Please leave it. Please sir.

824
01:05:24,966 --> 01:05:29,049
I will not leave you,
I will show you my power. Keep watching.

825
01:05:29,299 --> 01:05:31,382
Hey, stop it...

826
01:05:37,424 --> 01:05:40,632
You did a mistake and I hit you.

827
01:05:40,882 --> 01:05:44,007
Why don't you listen
when I apologize for hitting you?

828
01:05:44,216 --> 01:05:50,216
I am not any outsider living in Guntur
to fear and be frightened thinking of you.

829
01:05:50,466 --> 01:05:55,424
I am brought up in this same Guntur
eating the hot chili here. I too am Guntur guy.

830
01:05:57,507 --> 01:06:00,174
What will you show me... My foot.

831
01:06:00,674 --> 01:06:03,091
I'm saying it now...

832
01:06:04,132 --> 01:06:07,716
Leave the matter here.
It is good for us both.

833
01:06:08,007 --> 01:06:10,632
Understood?
- You are challenging me.

834
01:06:10,757 --> 01:06:15,716
You are very arrogant,
I will see your power.

835
01:06:15,757 --> 01:06:18,507
Come on...
if that is true...

836
01:06:19,174 --> 01:06:21,966
I will show you itch of my hands too.

837
01:06:22,049 --> 01:06:24,716
Hey... wait for me.

838
01:06:25,132 --> 01:06:27,091
I am waiting.

839
01:06:43,691 --> 01:06:47,149
Sorry bro, I couldn't take his beating
I told him the truth.

840
01:06:47,232 --> 01:06:50,107
I'll slap you...
Looks like a he-man in personality

841
01:06:50,191 --> 01:06:53,982
Couldn't take the beating it seems...
- we survived till now as we had cake on our faces

842
01:06:54,066 --> 01:06:56,524
Darn... we all would have been safe
if this fellow had cake on his face.

843
01:06:57,149 --> 01:07:00,024
Bro, we heard about that Seshu
But we never saw him.

844
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:02,107
And you directly messed with him.

845
01:07:02,232 --> 01:07:04,357
Now, why will he give
Amrutha to you in marriage?

846
01:07:04,524 --> 01:07:06,441
How will I know
that it will happen like this?

847
01:07:06,774 --> 01:07:11,941
Whatever, I can't let go Amrutha
I will do anything for her.

848
01:07:14,441 --> 01:07:17,649
Either Amrutha or my dad should not know
about this matter.

849
01:07:18,232 --> 01:07:20,024
I, myself will tell them
at the right moment.

850
01:07:20,399 --> 01:07:22,191
Understood?
- Yes.

851
01:07:26,399 --> 01:07:30,191
You challenged me...
- See my itch, Come on...

852
01:07:30,232 --> 01:07:33,357
Wait for me.
- Seshu, CM sir is calling

853
01:07:33,899 --> 01:07:35,274
Hello sir...
- Hello.

854
01:07:35,399 --> 01:07:39,857
Mr. Koteswar told about you...
I also came to know that you can spend money.

855
01:07:40,149 --> 01:07:41,982
You have a good community strength too.

856
01:07:42,066 --> 01:07:44,482
I don't have any problem giving you a ticket
we will do it.

857
01:07:44,607 --> 01:07:49,524
But as per the information I got, came to know that
you are short tempered, blabber a lot, impatient

858
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:53,607
Look Mr. Seshu, such things will not work in politics
you should be very controlled.

859
01:07:53,732 --> 01:07:56,274
Though we have many faults in us,
public should not get to know about those.

860
01:07:56,357 --> 01:07:58,232
Be careful in this matter.

861
01:07:59,066 --> 01:08:01,191
I am there to take care of all those...

862
01:08:01,274 --> 01:08:05,024
Ok, there is still a long time
start doing your ground work.

863
01:08:05,191 --> 01:08:07,941
We shall talk about the next later...
- Thank you sir.

864
01:08:08,107 --> 01:08:10,607
Seshu, you are becoming big personality soon,

865
01:08:10,774 --> 01:08:13,024
You are becoming an MLA very soon.

866
01:08:13,649 --> 01:08:16,649
What? Ok, I understood.

867
01:08:16,857 --> 01:08:21,899
That fellow is poking in your heart
and is not letting you enjoy this happiness

868
01:08:22,066 --> 01:08:24,774
You think I don't have that pain?

869
01:08:25,357 --> 01:08:29,524
Still, what did CM say inside?
He said we should be very polite during such times.

870
01:08:29,649 --> 01:08:32,232
Yes... I'm not saying to leave him.

871
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:37,399
Finish him secretly using your criminal brain.

872
01:08:38,066 --> 01:08:40,316
I will not kill him immediately Koteswar Rao sir.

873
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:42,816
He will happily go if killed.

874
01:08:44,066 --> 01:08:47,107
He hit me, added he challenged me.

875
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:49,899
I will show him
what I can do.

876
01:08:50,066 --> 01:08:53,399
I will show him that
between life and death there is hell....

877
01:08:53,774 --> 01:08:57,482
He wishes to die
experiencing the torture

878
01:08:57,607 --> 01:09:01,732
I will kill him in such a way...
He would be waiting for his own death.

879
01:09:02,191 --> 01:09:04,982
He will see
what Seshu can do.

880
01:09:07,066 --> 01:09:07,941
Let's go...

881
01:09:11,566 --> 01:09:13,566
Hello...
- What are you doing, Hero?

882
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:17,524
I was thinking it would be great
if you call me.

883
01:09:17,607 --> 01:09:21,524
You must be tired thinking about me
for so long

884
01:09:21,816 --> 01:09:25,024
come home, take me out now.

885
01:09:25,107 --> 01:09:28,024
Oh no, looks like Amrutha
is grown courageous

886
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:31,691
Nothing like that,
my brother went to Hyderabad.

887
01:09:31,982 --> 01:09:34,899
It takes time for him to come back,
This is the free time.

888
01:09:35,066 --> 01:09:38,649
It's difficult to get such a chance...
So, let us use it to the fullest.

889
01:09:38,732 --> 01:09:43,357
"Feels like to have covered the globe
Feels like to have crossed the sea"

890
01:09:43,482 --> 01:09:47,107
"Feels like I climbed the Everest"

891
01:09:48,232 --> 01:09:52,857
"Feels like dancing on the moon
Feels like moving in the galaxy"

892
01:09:53,066 --> 01:09:56,816
"I feel like jumping in the clouds"

893
01:10:07,774 --> 01:10:12,107
"Heart is repeatedly pushing me towards you"

894
01:10:12,774 --> 01:10:17,191
"No idea what is this wonder, but is great"

895
01:10:22,357 --> 01:10:26,649
"My heart is getting in to you
and refusing to come back"

896
01:10:27,232 --> 01:10:31,732
"I like this a lot feels like
great celebration every second"

897
01:10:32,024 --> 01:10:36,357
"Feels like sky is in reach with you beside me"

898
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:41,107
"My life is fulfilled with you as my company"

899
01:10:41,649 --> 01:10:45,691
"Unknown pleasure is really great"

900
01:10:46,357 --> 01:10:50,607
"My heart said not to ask about it"

901
01:11:06,232 --> 01:11:07,857
Who is that girl Kanna?
- Which girl?

902
01:11:07,941 --> 01:11:11,399
The girl you are talking to
- Oh her? I was telling her some address.

903
01:11:11,982 --> 01:11:13,649
When there are so many people,
why did she ask you?

904
01:11:13,941 --> 01:11:16,732
Ok, wait... I'll ask her and say.
No need...

905
01:11:17,024 --> 01:11:20,149
Ok, enough of your wandering.
Come home fast now.

906
01:11:21,191 --> 01:11:25,732
"It feels new and a pleasure is on"

907
01:11:25,941 --> 01:11:30,191
"It came to me like a shadow of moon light"

908
01:11:30,857 --> 01:11:35,066
"Never seen beauty has come before me"

909
01:11:35,482 --> 01:11:40,066
"I feel great tension never like before"

910
01:11:40,441 --> 01:11:44,816
"I am always into your thoughts"

911
01:11:45,232 --> 01:11:49,649
"I am always dreaming about you"

912
01:11:50,024 --> 01:11:54,232
"Unknown pleasure is really great"

913
01:11:54,774 --> 01:11:58,899
"My heart said not to ask about it"

914
01:12:14,357 --> 01:12:17,566
Is she asking you about ladies toilet?

915
01:12:20,316 --> 01:12:25,024
Dear.. you seem to be cute and mannered
and like a girl from a good family

916
01:12:25,357 --> 01:12:27,732
How did you fall for our hot Guntur guy?

917
01:12:28,816 --> 01:12:30,732
Did he trick you into this relation?

918
01:12:30,899 --> 01:12:34,066
No, nothing so uncle.
He told only truth

919
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:36,191
Did you like him
even after he said the truth?

920
01:12:36,357 --> 01:12:37,816
I liked him just because of that uncle.

921
01:12:37,941 --> 01:12:42,191
You look to be a clever girl.
Not just my son but even I like you.

922
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:47,274
"Till date when you were not near"

923
01:12:47,649 --> 01:12:52,107
"I never observed me being here"

924
01:12:52,524 --> 01:12:56,941
"Heart beat changed only after meeting you"

925
01:12:57,274 --> 01:13:01,607
"Life says your company should be there"

926
01:13:02,024 --> 01:13:06,649
"My hope and breath are always you"

927
01:13:06,899 --> 01:13:11,524
"Your smile gave assurance with me"

928
01:13:11,732 --> 01:13:16,024
"Unknown pleasure is really great"

929
01:13:16,524 --> 01:13:20,649
"My heart said not to ask about it"

930
01:13:28,149 --> 01:13:29,316
Bye...

931
01:13:31,357 --> 01:13:33,316
What?
- Give me a kiss and go.

932
01:13:33,441 --> 01:13:34,816
Here? No shame?

933
01:13:34,857 --> 01:13:37,316
Will we lose the chance
for shame?

934
01:13:37,399 --> 01:13:38,191
Leave me...

935
01:13:38,649 --> 01:13:40,357
It would not look good
if someone see us.

936
01:13:41,482 --> 01:13:44,274
Nobody can see us in this darkness, come.

937
01:13:50,107 --> 01:13:50,816
Good night.

938
01:13:53,857 --> 01:13:57,149
These girls are so.
They keep teasing and finally trap.

939
01:13:57,191 --> 01:13:58,691
Girls must be crazy

940
01:14:27,732 --> 01:14:29,607
Get up...

941
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:33,341
Wait here...
we will take care of her.

942
01:14:42,216 --> 01:14:44,216
Did you save that girl last night?
- Yes sir...

943
01:14:44,466 --> 01:14:47,591
Was nobody there that time?
- No one sir

944
01:14:47,882 --> 01:14:49,799
Ok, you wait here.

945
01:14:50,257 --> 01:14:52,466
Sir... Do you know anything about them?

946
01:14:52,549 --> 01:14:54,966
Not yet sir.
I called all the suspects...

947
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:57,757
Once she gets conscious,
we will get to know who they were sir.

948
01:14:57,841 --> 01:14:59,549
Don't worry sir...
I will take care of it.

949
01:14:59,716 --> 01:15:01,424
Ok... thank you sir.

950
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:06,657
Inspector sir, you can question her now

951
01:15:07,115 --> 01:15:09,615
Look madam, I have got all the suspects

952
01:15:09,990 --> 01:15:13,199
Identify him...
there is no need for you to fear anyone.

953
01:15:43,324 --> 01:15:47,407
Rascal, you raped and thought she is dead

954
01:15:47,782 --> 01:15:52,490
Then joined her in the hospital
thinking no one would get a doubt. What a great plan

955
01:15:52,615 --> 01:15:54,949
Show him hell...

956
01:16:01,782 --> 01:16:02,657
Oh no...

957
01:16:06,574 --> 01:16:09,074
Sir... sir... My son knows nothing.

958
01:16:09,282 --> 01:16:11,032
You are beating him unnecessarily...

959
01:16:11,115 --> 01:16:15,157
Oh, you think we have no work
and brought him here to do time pass..

960
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:19,115
Are you supporting him for the dirty thing he did
instead of tearing him apart?

961
01:16:19,157 --> 01:16:20,782
What kind of father are you?
Are you not ashamed?

962
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:23,949
No sir, he will never do such thing...

963
01:16:24,199 --> 01:16:26,907
You arrested him thinking as someone else...

964
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:30,074
The same girl who  got raped
pointed at him and showed him.

965
01:16:30,324 --> 01:16:33,740
Shall we leave him or should felicitate him?

966
01:16:33,907 --> 01:16:37,032
Enough of crying, go now
and prepare for his after death formalities.

967
01:16:37,532 --> 01:16:38,865
Oh no sir, this is all not justified.
- Subbu...

968
01:16:39,074 --> 01:16:43,324
He is talking about justice near the Police station.
Is this not funny?

969
01:16:43,615 --> 01:16:45,907
Push him out.
- Move on man, move.

970
01:16:46,449 --> 01:16:48,532
You will not get a bail in this case
wherever you go.

971
01:16:48,657 --> 01:16:52,324
Lawyer Seshu planned all this
and he wantedly pushed your son into this.

972
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:53,949
No use how much ever you worry.

973
01:16:54,199 --> 01:16:58,574
If your son has to come out of this,
go and request him and there maybe some chance.

974
01:16:58,990 --> 01:17:01,740
Why would he push my son into this?
- How will I know...

975
01:17:01,865 --> 01:17:03,365
About what is there
in between him and your son?

976
01:17:04,115 --> 01:17:07,032
I told the information I have...
Go man... go...

977
01:17:08,032 --> 01:17:10,074
You are a great guy.

978
01:17:12,365 --> 01:17:13,782
Hey Suri babu, what happened?

979
01:17:14,199 --> 01:17:17,865
Get the phone number of criminal lawyer Seshu
and message me...

980
01:17:18,074 --> 01:17:19,324
I will be waiting.

981
01:17:23,532 --> 01:17:24,699
Hello...
- Hello...

982
01:17:24,865 --> 01:17:25,615
Who is this?

983
01:17:26,115 --> 01:17:28,949
My name is Surya narayana
and I am father of Kanna sir.

984
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:33,490
Tell me...
- You trapped my son into some case...

985
01:17:33,532 --> 01:17:35,699
You got him arrested.
I need to speak with you.

986
01:17:35,949 --> 01:17:38,115
Come to my office...
- I am coming immediately

987
01:17:42,532 --> 01:17:44,615
Whom do you want?
- Seshu sir called me

988
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:46,157
He left just now..

989
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:49,282
Any idea where did he go?
- To Mr. Koteswar rao place...

990
01:17:57,782 --> 01:18:00,240
What is that speed?
Go slowly.

991
01:18:00,324 --> 01:18:03,949
Do you think any youngster? You will die.
- Sorry sir.

992
01:18:12,449 --> 01:18:15,074
Is Mr. Seshu there?
- He is on the top floor. Go.

993
01:18:48,032 --> 01:18:49,782
Yes... roofing is done.

994
01:18:49,907 --> 01:18:51,907
Yes, tiles in that fourth floor...
- Greetings sir...

995
01:18:55,574 --> 01:19:00,199
I don't know what my son did.
But he is not a guy doing such bad things.

996
01:19:00,282 --> 01:19:02,865
I came to know that you got him into that case.

997
01:19:03,782 --> 01:19:05,240
Please let him go.

998
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:07,949
He did a bigger mistake than that.
Shall I let him go?

999
01:19:08,115 --> 01:19:11,324
Hey, do you know what he did?
Do you know?

1000
01:19:11,449 --> 01:19:13,782
What has he done sir?
- He hit me.

1001
01:19:14,115 --> 01:19:16,074
Shall I let him go?

1002
01:19:16,157 --> 01:19:18,782
Why did he hit you sir?
- Go and ask him.

1003
01:19:19,365 --> 01:19:22,532
Go and ask whether he hit
getting high or not knowing me.

1004
01:19:22,949 --> 01:19:24,157
May be he didn't know sir...

1005
01:19:24,199 --> 01:19:26,740
Either knowing or unknowing,
I will not leave that idiot.

1006
01:19:27,407 --> 01:19:28,907
I have been searching from a month,

1007
01:19:29,282 --> 01:19:31,865
With the ego to have escaped
he challenged with me.

1008
01:19:32,115 --> 01:19:33,532
How do I let him go?

1009
01:19:33,865 --> 01:19:36,574
Sir, I am apologizing on his behalf.

1010
01:19:36,907 --> 01:19:38,782
Please leave him sir...

1011
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:41,199
I should leave him...
for his sorry it seems...

1012
01:19:41,365 --> 01:19:44,199
I will kill your son and ask you to forgive.

1013
01:19:44,282 --> 01:19:46,324
Will you leave me?

1014
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:50,615
No chance that I leave him...

1015
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:53,657
Sir, do not say so.
He is my life

1016
01:19:53,949 --> 01:19:57,157
I will do anything for him.
Please don't harm him sir.

1017
01:19:57,324 --> 01:20:00,990
Will you do anything?
Then fall on his feet and ask to forgive.

1018
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,865
Maybe he would melt a bit.

1019
01:20:03,074 --> 01:20:05,615
Seshu, is that fine with you?

1020
01:20:05,782 --> 01:20:08,115
Ok...
- He agreed.

1021
01:20:08,657 --> 01:20:12,699
Look, you will not get such bumper offer again.
Go, go and catch his feet.

1022
01:20:13,865 --> 01:20:15,449
What are you staring at?

1023
01:20:16,365 --> 01:20:18,907
Oh, you are his father...

1024
01:20:19,865 --> 01:20:21,824
I think both of you
have the same genes...

1025
01:20:22,490 --> 01:20:24,699
The same attitude
and the same behavior!

1026
01:20:24,865 --> 01:20:26,615
I will bring that down...

1027
01:20:32,324 --> 01:20:33,657
Ramesh...
- Tell me sir...

1028
01:20:33,865 --> 01:20:34,740
What is he doing?

1029
01:20:34,824 --> 01:20:38,740
He is taken third degree for the third time
and is just relaxing sir

1030
01:20:39,699 --> 01:20:42,907
Our guys are going for a tea break sir.
We will start again after the tea break sir.

1031
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:44,449
Switch the speaker on.
- Ok sir...

1032
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:47,115
It would be good even
if he listens to what is happening there...

1033
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:53,115
Finish him in the cell itself, is it possible?

1034
01:20:53,490 --> 01:20:57,199
You know it, right sir?
It would be a problem with media..

1035
01:20:57,324 --> 01:21:00,199
If you give me half an hour time,
I will take him out...

1036
01:21:00,282 --> 01:21:02,282
Finish in encounter
saying he tried to escape.

1037
01:21:02,407 --> 01:21:03,324
Ok...

1038
01:21:03,699 --> 01:21:05,907
Ok, do it...
- Sir, no sir.

1039
01:21:06,157 --> 01:21:08,990
I will catch your feet sir...
- No father...

1040
01:21:09,657 --> 01:21:10,907
Hey Ramesh, wait.

1041
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:14,157
Looks like the stubbornness has come down.
Emotion looks good.

1042
01:21:14,199 --> 01:21:17,490
Yes sir, I will catch your feet...

1043
01:21:17,865 --> 01:21:20,199
No father...

1044
01:21:21,615 --> 01:21:25,490
Come on, he is saying to catch.
Let him go, poor fellow

1045
01:21:25,990 --> 01:21:27,282
Ramesh..
- Yes sir...

1046
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:29,782
Leave him and I will say what to do next

1047
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:30,824
Ok sir...

1048
01:21:42,324 --> 01:21:44,365
Hey stop it.

1049
01:21:46,324 --> 01:21:47,365
Don't touch me...

1050
01:21:47,949 --> 01:21:51,490
I will not touch cheap fellows like you,
even if it is my leg.

1051
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:53,199
Koteswara Rao sir,

1052
01:21:53,615 --> 01:21:56,615
You just said it so
and he believed it,

1053
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:02,949
What?
- Poor fellow, love on his son is like that.

1054
01:22:04,365 --> 01:22:08,365
Hey, go and say your son that
you came down a lot to save him

1055
01:22:08,449 --> 01:22:10,574
But could not save him. Come on cry!

1056
01:22:10,824 --> 01:22:12,990
His hands itch a lot, it seems

1057
01:22:13,615 --> 01:22:15,282
It's all gone now...

1058
01:22:15,865 --> 01:22:17,699
Do you think it is over so fast?

1059
01:22:18,824 --> 01:22:20,990
He will die in encounter...

1060
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:24,199
You will die with the pain of losing son.

1061
01:22:24,990 --> 01:22:29,074
Die witnessing how it feels
messing with Seshu.

1062
01:22:29,324 --> 01:22:30,032
Get out.

1063
01:23:00,699 --> 01:23:02,074
Kanna...

1064
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:06,115
Kanna...

1065
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:08,949
Kanna...

1066
01:23:11,532 --> 01:23:13,199
Father...
- Kanna...

1067
01:23:18,324 --> 01:23:21,365
What is this son?
- Father...

1068
01:23:22,282 --> 01:23:27,615
You should not cry father.
I will not leave him for insulting you.

1069
01:23:27,657 --> 01:23:28,782
Shut up...

1070
01:23:29,699 --> 01:23:32,240
Not that you do something to him,

1071
01:23:33,032 --> 01:23:35,699
but he trapped you into a case
where you don't even get a bail.

1072
01:23:36,074 --> 01:23:40,240
My fear is how you would come out of this.
- Don't be afraid father...

1073
01:23:40,657 --> 01:23:44,032
I will somehow come out of this father...
- How?

1074
01:23:44,407 --> 01:23:45,532
How?

1075
01:23:46,032 --> 01:23:49,990
That is why I said not to get into such fights
and you did not listen to me...

1076
01:23:50,157 --> 01:23:51,740
See, what has happened now.

1077
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:59,699
Am I still alive to see you like this?

1078
01:23:59,865 --> 01:24:03,532
Dad, don't cry.
Believe me dad, believe me.

1079
01:24:03,574 --> 01:24:05,740
Kanna...

1080
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:09,407
Hello sir...

1081
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:15,949
I heard you are contesting as MLA
and came to know that ticket is confirmed.

1082
01:24:16,074 --> 01:24:20,657
There are many unions such as Dwakra, Anganwadi
and senior citizen education  in rural

1083
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:22,907
I organize all those activities.

1084
01:24:22,990 --> 01:24:23,782
Good.

1085
01:24:24,324 --> 01:24:24,949
Very good.

1086
01:24:26,282 --> 01:24:28,365
I have around 10, 000 ladies votes with me.

1087
01:24:28,490 --> 01:24:31,365
I wish to support you in the coming elections.

1088
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:33,282
What are you expecting?

1089
01:24:35,699 --> 01:24:39,699
Nobody serves without any use, right?
Please tell me what are you expecting.

1090
01:24:41,032 --> 01:24:44,407
If you ask me so directly¦
- No problem, say me

1091
01:24:45,574 --> 01:24:46,740
Up to two crore¦

1092
01:24:47,824 --> 01:24:51,074
Cr is become a joke these days.
What do you think a crore is?

1093
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:54,740
They get ready like vultures to loot
when someone newly enters politics.

1094
01:24:54,824 --> 01:24:57,990
I know well how to graph the ladies votes.

1095
01:24:58,115 --> 01:25:00,740
Ladies means the sentimental fools.

1096
01:25:00,907 --> 01:25:03,032
They watch meaningless daily soaps...

1097
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:08,699
Get connected to the incidents
like their own and keep crying.

1098
01:25:08,782 --> 01:25:11,782
I very well know how to get
the votes of those fools.

1099
01:25:12,157 --> 01:25:13,407
Go and look into your work.

1100
01:25:13,532 --> 01:25:15,532
You are insulting ladies a lot...

1101
01:25:15,615 --> 01:25:18,949
Yes, they are so for me. Go!

1102
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:37,407
Vijaya... hey Vijaya

1103
01:25:37,490 --> 01:25:38,865
What happened hubby?
- Can you not listen?

1104
01:25:39,449 --> 01:25:42,407
Cigarettes are over. Are there any?
- No hubby

1105
01:25:42,532 --> 01:25:44,282
Hey Ramu...

1106
01:25:44,657 --> 01:25:45,282
Sir...

1107
01:25:45,657 --> 01:25:49,449
Cigarettes are over.  get my brand urgently.
- Ok sir...

1108
01:25:52,824 --> 01:25:53,657
Tell me sir..

1109
01:25:54,407 --> 01:25:55,865
Cigarettes at home are over.

1110
01:25:56,115 --> 01:25:58,824
Bring a carton and keep it at home
once the shop is opened.

1111
01:25:59,157 --> 01:26:00,532
Cut the call.
- Ok sir...

1112
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:02,907
Sir...

1113
01:26:03,282 --> 01:26:04,865
They don't have any cigarettes...

1114
01:26:05,074 --> 01:26:07,240
He doesn't have any cigarette? Move...

1115
01:26:11,282 --> 01:26:13,657
No cigarettes at all?
- Yes sir, not available

1116
01:26:13,699 --> 01:26:16,282
You crazy idiot, why did you keep this shop
with no cigarettes?

1117
01:26:16,407 --> 01:26:18,490
What shall I do
when his stock is over sir?

1118
01:26:18,907 --> 01:26:21,657
Go and lick his feet, bloody fool...

1119
01:26:22,657 --> 01:26:24,782
Leave it Seshu sir, take the cigarette.

1120
01:26:32,865 --> 01:26:35,865
When I gave one cigarette feeling pity
why has he taken the whole pack?

1121
01:26:38,574 --> 01:26:39,740
Yes, coming...

1122
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:40,990
Stop... stop...

1123
01:26:41,532 --> 01:26:42,657
Yes, tell me...

1124
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:44,490
One minute...

1125
01:26:44,949 --> 01:26:48,115
Sir, you should not speak while driving.
You have to pay the fine.

1126
01:26:48,199 --> 01:26:50,615
Do you know me?
Speaking rules with me

1127
01:26:50,657 --> 01:26:52,324
Whoever you are,
mistake is a mistake...

1128
01:26:52,532 --> 01:26:54,615
We have our rules sir, pay the fine.

1129
01:26:55,157 --> 01:26:56,782
Stopping my vehicle is a mistake.

1130
01:26:56,990 --> 01:26:59,199
Lawyer, criminal lawyer Seshu here,

1131
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:01,615
You are after all a constable
and don't over act.

1132
01:27:02,449 --> 01:27:04,782
I will not pay, do whatever you can.

1133
01:27:05,282 --> 01:27:06,574
Hey... move.

1134
01:27:11,865 --> 01:27:13,949
Hi everybody, welcome to wake up citizen.

1135
01:27:14,032 --> 01:27:17,699
In our channel showing the behavior
of our politicians in real

1136
01:27:17,865 --> 01:27:21,199
And showing the awareness
in entertaining manner.

1137
01:27:21,282 --> 01:27:23,115
You know how popular has
this program become...

1138
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:26,574
We have seen the behavior
of many politicians.

1139
01:27:26,699 --> 01:27:28,282
But now you are going to see...

1140
01:27:28,324 --> 01:27:33,240
The behavior of criminal lawyer Seshu
who got the MLA ticket of Guntur one in this episode.

1141
01:27:34,199 --> 01:27:36,407
Some are aware of him in Guntur
as a chain smoker,

1142
01:27:36,615 --> 01:27:39,782
As a chain smoker, high in anger,
ego and rigid.

1143
01:27:39,907 --> 01:27:43,365
Let us now see a real episode
how it would be if he comes into politics.

1144
01:27:51,865 --> 01:27:53,240
This is his way.

1145
01:27:53,407 --> 01:27:58,615
He has no respect at all on a normal citizen,
Government employee, law and finally even a lady.

1146
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:02,657
Hey, go do your work...

1147
01:28:05,282 --> 01:28:08,115
He hit us Seshu,
it maybe that fellow.

1148
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:14,407
Hello Seshu sir...

1149
01:28:14,824 --> 01:28:17,449
I am Surya narayana

1150
01:28:17,949 --> 01:28:19,115
Father of Kanna.

1151
01:28:19,324 --> 01:28:22,532
Are you good sir?
I am a man having some respect sir.

1152
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:29,532
However rude you talk to me,
I will give respect to you and speak sir.

1153
01:28:29,907 --> 01:28:31,365
You saw the video right?

1154
01:28:31,907 --> 01:28:34,407
Is the picture quality and sound effects good?

1155
01:28:34,532 --> 01:28:36,365
By the time you come home sleep...

1156
01:28:36,532 --> 01:28:39,865
And have a meeting with Koteswara Rao
my son had finished the film sir.

1157
01:28:40,324 --> 01:28:44,490
Whatever doubts you have about
the picture making,

1158
01:28:44,657 --> 01:28:48,324
Ask my son and clarify.
Here, talk with my son.

1159
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:50,365
Hey Seshu...

1160
01:28:50,949 --> 01:28:53,990
To earn anything in life is very difficult.

1161
01:28:54,615 --> 01:28:57,324
But to ruin that is very easy.

1162
01:28:57,782 --> 01:29:01,115
I know how hard you tried
for the MLA ticket.

1163
01:29:01,490 --> 01:29:05,324
If I click one send button
for this video to CM and media

1164
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:09,824
The nest you built with so much hard work...
will be shattered.

1165
01:29:11,407 --> 01:29:14,240
You got anger... feel like killing me?

1166
01:29:14,699 --> 01:29:18,949
Then how should I feel
for insulting my dad so much?

1167
01:29:22,032 --> 01:29:24,032
Hey, I will not leave you.

1168
01:29:24,782 --> 01:29:26,157
I won't leave you...

1169
01:29:26,532 --> 01:29:29,907
Do you know how would it be
messing with Kanna?

1170
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:33,199
You will be shattered...

1171
01:29:33,449 --> 01:29:36,865
If yours is a criminal brain,
mine is a creative brain.

1172
01:29:39,157 --> 01:29:44,990
I did so much being in the cell
and you can't withstand if I am out....

1173
01:29:45,282 --> 01:29:46,990
You will shiver.

1174
01:29:47,532 --> 01:29:50,949
Look, you are a youngster and high on anger.

1175
01:29:51,074 --> 01:29:54,199
I am saying wishing for your good, listen to me.
Don't act crazy.

1176
01:29:54,407 --> 01:29:57,740
Delete that video
and fall on the feet of Seshu...

1177
01:29:57,865 --> 01:30:01,949
He will forgive you.
You have seen very less of Seshu.

1178
01:30:02,449 --> 01:30:06,824
I am saying as an elder, listen.
Why do you unnecessarily mess with your death?

1179
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:12,115
Thanks a lot sir for saying it...

1180
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:14,615
I need to say one matter to you
in this context.

1181
01:30:15,615 --> 01:30:19,532
Recently when I was chatting in fun
with my friends, I had a problem...

1182
01:30:20,074 --> 01:30:25,240
Had been to Doctor for a check-up...
He did many tests and asked for my age.

1183
01:30:25,782 --> 01:30:27,407
I said 26.

1184
01:30:27,657 --> 01:30:30,865
He got angry and said what is happening
to this generation.

1185
01:30:30,990 --> 01:30:32,865
He got frustrated a lot and irritated.

1186
01:30:33,532 --> 01:30:37,282
I was tensed and asked
what was wrong with me.

1187
01:30:37,449 --> 01:30:41,615
He shouted loud saying I have high BP
in such a small age.

1188
01:30:41,865 --> 01:30:45,949
I got worried and asked
whether I have any problem.

1189
01:30:46,074 --> 01:30:49,532
Doctor said problem was not for me
but the one making me get BP.

1190
01:30:49,907 --> 01:30:51,865
So told the doctor.

1191
01:30:52,699 --> 01:30:54,449
Hope you understood.

1192
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:59,199
How it would be if an youngster like me
gets into a high BP.

1193
01:31:00,449 --> 01:31:02,615
I am leaving it to your imagination...

1194
01:31:03,282 --> 01:31:05,865
If you really wish for the good
of your friend Seshu,

1195
01:31:06,199 --> 01:31:07,532
Warn him...

1196
01:31:07,699 --> 01:31:11,032
Not to mess with me
and he will be ruined.

1197
01:31:11,824 --> 01:31:14,199
Ok... what you need?

1198
01:31:14,407 --> 01:31:18,615
Do you think this is house of my in-laws
to spend my whole life in this cell

1199
01:31:18,949 --> 01:31:22,365
Or I am a old guy like you
with all wants dead?

1200
01:31:22,490 --> 01:31:25,032
Say that fellow to take back the case.

1201
01:31:31,157 --> 01:31:32,449
You are very elder...

1202
01:31:33,199 --> 01:31:34,657
Hope you understood...

1203
01:31:34,699 --> 01:31:36,282
Come on agree to it Seshu...

1204
01:31:37,782 --> 01:31:39,115
Ok...

1205
01:31:39,699 --> 01:31:41,782
Are you happy now?
Leave it now.

1206
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:57,324
Hey Kanna...
I will fix your marriage with Amrutha.

1207
01:31:57,490 --> 01:32:01,657
It is already delayed because of those idiots.
We shall directly go to her parents and talk to them.

1208
01:32:01,740 --> 01:32:04,990
Amrutha has no father, dad...
- She will has a mother right?

1209
01:32:05,074 --> 01:32:08,449
No mother too, it is all her brother.
Whatever, we have to speak with her brother.

1210
01:32:08,532 --> 01:32:10,407
Say who is he and we shall talk with him.

1211
01:32:10,532 --> 01:32:13,449
Our criminal lawyer Seshu¦

1212
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:20,949
Why didn't you tell this fact to me earlier?
- Didn't want to tense you

1213
01:32:21,532 --> 01:32:24,324
You want to directly give a shock
and kill with heart attack?

1214
01:32:26,824 --> 01:32:28,782
Here, Ammu called
when we were talking of her.

1215
01:32:28,907 --> 01:32:31,574
I will go to a side and talk with love.
You enjoy with these.

1216
01:32:31,615 --> 01:32:32,740
Hey come on¦

1217
01:32:32,824 --> 01:32:34,532
I got call from Ammu.

1218
01:32:34,615 --> 01:32:36,032
Ammu hi...

1219
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:39,199
I tried many times for you
and your phone was switched off.

1220
01:32:39,532 --> 01:32:42,949
Sorry Ammu, I gave the phone for repair
as it fell down.

1221
01:32:43,324 --> 01:32:45,865
I miss you dear.
I wish to see you urgently.

1222
01:32:45,949 --> 01:32:46,865
Now?

1223
01:32:47,865 --> 01:32:49,407
My brother is at home now.

1224
01:32:49,657 --> 01:32:53,615
Oh no, I do not know all that.
I am just starting and coming. That is all.

1225
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:01,074
I will see brother...

1226
01:33:08,365 --> 01:33:09,074
Hi...

1227
01:33:10,574 --> 01:33:11,699
Who is it dear?

1228
01:33:15,949 --> 01:33:19,490
Delivery boy from Flipkart, brother...
- What did you order?

1229
01:33:21,990 --> 01:33:24,949
Ipad brother...
- Open it, see and take it.

1230
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:28,532
It seems online people these days
are delivering keeping stones in it

1231
01:33:28,949 --> 01:33:30,074
Ok brother...

1232
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,615
You saw right? Go now...

1233
01:33:33,324 --> 01:33:36,782
I will leave from here
if you give me a kiss. Kiss!

1234
01:33:36,865 --> 01:33:38,032
Please go...

1235
01:33:39,449 --> 01:33:40,990
Brother will see, go...

1236
01:33:41,865 --> 01:33:43,365
He will not see, come on...

1237
01:33:43,740 --> 01:33:46,782
I'll die in fear, please go

1238
01:33:46,990 --> 01:33:49,324
I am likely to die
if you don't give me kiss

1239
01:33:49,824 --> 01:33:52,199
I am coming to Divya™s marriage tomorrow
and we will see there.

1240
01:33:52,324 --> 01:33:53,615
Please go...

1241
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:01,574
Hey stop...

1242
01:34:15,824 --> 01:34:16,782
Come here...

1243
01:34:19,574 --> 01:34:22,032
How is Flipkart sales in Guntur?

1244
01:34:22,157 --> 01:34:24,574
Oh, pretty good sir. It is very nice...

1245
01:34:24,865 --> 01:34:26,532
How many are working?

1246
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:28,782
Around 40 to 50 sir...

1247
01:34:29,949 --> 01:34:30,782
Ok, go...

1248
01:34:31,365 --> 01:34:32,407
Thank you sir...

1249
01:34:36,449 --> 01:34:38,157
Brother-in-law does not know my face...

1250
01:34:38,407 --> 01:34:39,782
I unnecessarily got tensed.

1251
01:34:45,965 --> 01:34:48,548
What?
- Ammu, why has she still not come?

1252
01:34:48,590 --> 01:34:49,590
Call her bro..

1253
01:34:50,007 --> 01:34:53,465
Bro, your brain is extra ordinary...

1254
01:34:53,590 --> 01:34:56,298
Mine is a normal brain
and do not keep it in my account.

1255
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:57,382
You just call and that is enough...
- Do it...

1256
01:35:00,257 --> 01:35:01,340
it is ringing...

1257
01:35:03,215 --> 01:35:05,465
Hi Ammu, where are you?
I am waiting here.

1258
01:35:05,590 --> 01:35:07,423
I am just starting, coming...

1259
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:11,590
You promised to give me something today...
Come fast and give that.

1260
01:35:11,673 --> 01:35:13,132
Do not keep any such hopes...

1261
01:35:13,257 --> 01:35:14,840
Brothers assistant is also coming
along with me.

1262
01:35:14,923 --> 01:35:16,340
You should say that
before keeping hopes.

1263
01:35:16,882 --> 01:35:19,840
It is very difficult to control
after keeping the hopes Ammu

1264
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:22,590
Come on, do not pester dear.
I am coming. Bye

1265
01:35:24,132 --> 01:35:25,923
My dear soldiers...

1266
01:35:26,465 --> 01:35:29,382
It seems Seshu's assistant is coming
along with Ammu...

1267
01:35:30,548 --> 01:35:34,340
Side him out so that he does not disturb
my romantic scene

1268
01:35:34,673 --> 01:35:36,007
Leave his matter to us...

1269
01:35:36,132 --> 01:35:38,840
You enjoy in romance with Ammu

1270
01:35:38,965 --> 01:35:40,757
We will take care of him...

1271
01:35:42,132 --> 01:35:43,340
Hi...
- Hi...

1272
01:35:43,757 --> 01:35:45,340
Hello Sekhar sir...
Greetings...

1273
01:35:45,465 --> 01:35:47,590
You are Sekhar sir, PA of Seshu sir right?
- How are you sir?

1274
01:35:47,673 --> 01:35:49,507
Do you know me?
- How can we not know you sir...

1275
01:35:49,590 --> 01:35:51,507
Is there anyone not knowing you in Guntur sir?

1276
01:35:51,673 --> 01:35:53,465
Hey...
- Sekhar sir...

1277
01:35:53,632 --> 01:35:56,923
Hey Srinu, Sekhar sir,
Our Seshu sir's assistant.

1278
01:35:57,007 --> 01:35:59,340
Hi Sekhar sir...
- we never expected that you would come here.

1279
01:35:59,423 --> 01:36:00,923
It is our luck to have you sir.

1280
01:36:01,007 --> 01:36:03,132
Hey, we need to take good care of Sekhar sir.

1281
01:36:03,173 --> 01:36:06,923
how can we let go when we get to spend time
with a person like Sekhar sir?

1282
01:36:07,298 --> 01:36:09,132
We will enjoy a lot sir...
- Come on sir, come on

1283
01:36:09,257 --> 01:36:11,465
All these days, I thought was working
with that mad fellow...

1284
01:36:11,590 --> 01:36:12,882
There is a good following outside
for me too then.

1285
01:36:12,923 --> 01:36:16,465
Have you seen the to be husband of Divya?
He is just like a aged pumpkin.

1286
01:36:16,632 --> 01:36:18,632
He is too aged
and also a comedy face

1287
01:36:20,257 --> 01:36:21,090
Ammu...

1288
01:36:22,132 --> 01:36:22,923
What?

1289
01:36:23,215 --> 01:36:25,923
You said we'll plan in the marriage, right?

1290
01:36:26,090 --> 01:36:29,132
Come on, let us search for the place.
- In the marriage?

1291
01:36:30,007 --> 01:36:32,757
See, there are so many here.
Will you not have any tension at all?

1292
01:36:33,132 --> 01:36:37,548
Will we waste the lucky moments
we got keeping tension

1293
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:42,465
Still, we got to enjoy
each and every moment

1294
01:36:43,007 --> 01:36:45,840
You say these stupid philosophies greatly.

1295
01:36:46,007 --> 01:36:48,965
I also kiss great.

1296
01:36:49,382 --> 01:36:51,465
Come on, we will kiss.

1297
01:36:53,298 --> 01:36:57,173
I think there is none in this room.
Now nobody can stop us.

1298
01:37:08,715 --> 01:37:10,048
You need anything?

1299
01:37:10,590 --> 01:37:14,465
Why will he take if you give,
when there is the young girl with him?

1300
01:37:19,465 --> 01:37:20,757
Aunties...

1301
01:37:23,132 --> 01:37:24,382
Bye aunties...

1302
01:37:31,048 --> 01:37:34,048
Are you so hungry?

1303
01:37:35,257 --> 01:37:36,715
Food is not still ready...

1304
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:38,923
It takes time.

1305
01:37:41,132 --> 01:37:43,382
Oh... ok
- we will wait...

1306
01:37:43,465 --> 01:37:45,590
Come on Ammu...
- Looks like it is too busy here...

1307
01:37:45,882 --> 01:37:48,965
We are friends of Babu...
We came for the marriage and where is he?

1308
01:37:49,173 --> 01:37:51,965
Are you the friends of my son-in-law?
Wait, I will call him.

1309
01:38:01,757 --> 01:38:02,673
Hi...

1310
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:06,257
Hey Babu rao, super...

1311
01:38:06,673 --> 01:38:09,757
You look great as the groom... congrats.
- Thanks...

1312
01:38:09,923 --> 01:38:13,798
Though late, you are marrying in style,
you still look young.

1313
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:14,965
I love you...

1314
01:38:15,423 --> 01:38:18,132
Hey, none here perfectly know
about my age

1315
01:38:18,340 --> 01:38:20,923
Thus I called only you looking young like me.
- Ok...

1316
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:22,590
I love you dear...
- Thank you...

1317
01:38:22,923 --> 01:38:25,257
See this idiot...
- I couldn't avoid him...

1318
01:38:25,340 --> 01:38:27,215
I could not avoid him and called him
as sentiment as he is my childhood friend.

1319
01:38:27,298 --> 01:38:31,215
Look at his shape like to have lost whole life
after getting married like an old fellow

1320
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:33,173
I am saying you very seriously...

1321
01:38:33,507 --> 01:38:37,048
I will call you as uncle
when I need to talk with you.

1322
01:38:37,215 --> 01:38:38,173
Don't feel bad.

1323
01:38:38,965 --> 01:38:42,298
Hey, I arranged a party for you all...
Enjoy well...

1324
01:38:42,382 --> 01:38:44,298
Thanks dude, thank you.
- carry on.

1325
01:38:45,757 --> 01:38:47,965
Uncle it seems, he will call me uncle...

1326
01:38:48,465 --> 01:38:50,340
I felt this idiot will never get married.

1327
01:38:50,590 --> 01:38:53,465
Amaravathi became the capital
and his lands got the demand.

1328
01:38:53,548 --> 01:38:56,173
Finally he got a girl.
He feels like she came for him.

1329
01:38:57,340 --> 01:39:00,673
Don't feel bro, drinks are free.
Come on, we shall sip and talk

1330
01:39:01,007 --> 01:39:02,257
Pour more...
- Sir...

1331
01:39:02,548 --> 01:39:04,382
There is a talk in Guntur.
Is that true?

1332
01:39:04,465 --> 01:39:05,340
What is it?

1333
01:39:05,590 --> 01:39:08,507
That is, work will be done by Seshu
if you fix for it...

1334
01:39:08,673 --> 01:39:10,757
Also that Seshu sir never does anything
without your advice.

1335
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:12,840
Actually you are the main pillar
for the growth of Seshu sir

1336
01:39:12,882 --> 01:39:15,007
They say no Seshu at all without Sekhar...

1337
01:39:15,132 --> 01:39:17,423
Oh no, if our mad fellow
gets to know about this,

1338
01:39:17,590 --> 01:39:19,215
He will not just take out my job
but will kill me too.

1339
01:39:19,257 --> 01:39:20,673
What are you thinking sir?

1340
01:39:21,632 --> 01:39:25,340
Many respected me in my life
but none like you.

1341
01:39:25,757 --> 01:39:26,798
I like your affection...

1342
01:39:26,965 --> 01:39:28,965
If you ever need anything, ask me
and I will do that for you.

1343
01:39:29,007 --> 01:39:31,382
We do not need but our Kanna will need
and we will ask then.

1344
01:39:31,798 --> 01:39:33,173
Hey Kishore...
- what?

1345
01:39:33,257 --> 01:39:37,090
Has anyone seen the girl
our Baburao is marrying? -No bro...

1346
01:39:37,173 --> 01:39:40,965
She looks great it seems
and she is too much for our age bar idiot

1347
01:39:41,048 --> 01:39:42,673
Do you know what build up
is that fellow giving?

1348
01:39:42,757 --> 01:39:48,007
It seems she got some other match before
and she didn't like that guy and told on his face...

1349
01:39:48,215 --> 01:39:51,507
Chose him... she chose
this beautiful face it seems.

1350
01:39:51,715 --> 01:39:54,757
Does he have so much?
Anybody should believe when it is said right?

1351
01:39:56,840 --> 01:40:00,340
What guys, how are the arrangements?
- It is great... All the arrangements are fine.

1352
01:40:00,465 --> 01:40:02,548
Don't hesitate for anything.
Order for anything you need

1353
01:40:02,632 --> 01:40:04,882
Ya sure...
- What was the topic of discussion?

1354
01:40:05,465 --> 01:40:11,340
That one bro, someone had come before
to see Divya, she rejected him on face

1355
01:40:11,715 --> 01:40:15,673
Later she chose you for marriage...

1356
01:40:19,882 --> 01:40:23,048
Hey one minute. You continue
and I will be back again.

1357
01:40:23,132 --> 01:40:23,923
Thank you...

1358
01:40:24,382 --> 01:40:26,757
Hello excuse me.
you are laughing at me right?

1359
01:40:27,632 --> 01:40:30,215
That is not your matter sir. We had some joke
and are laughing in that timing sir

1360
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:32,298
No, laughs fell in our timing.

1361
01:40:32,382 --> 01:40:34,673
Definitely, it would be about us...
- No sir, this is a different topic.

1362
01:40:34,798 --> 01:40:36,923
Will you say or not.
If not, this marriage will not happen.

1363
01:40:36,965 --> 01:40:37,882
What is that sir?
- What happened sir?

1364
01:40:38,048 --> 01:40:39,882
I am so, a different person.
Come on say

1365
01:40:40,423 --> 01:40:44,298
Actually, it was our friend
who happened to see Divya first for marriage sir.

1366
01:40:44,465 --> 01:40:46,423
We too were with him that day...
- So?

1367
01:40:46,548 --> 01:40:49,548
Actually, it was not Divya rejecting sir.
Our friend rejected.

1368
01:40:49,673 --> 01:40:51,632
As you were saying that in reverse,
we got laugh and are laughing sir.

1369
01:40:51,673 --> 01:40:53,673
That means has Divya lied?
- No...

1370
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,590
Then, am I boasting out?
- Nothing like that sir

1371
01:40:55,632 --> 01:40:56,882
Neither this and nor that, then what?

1372
01:40:57,423 --> 01:40:58,798
What are you saying?

1373
01:40:59,090 --> 01:41:01,048
I need to know
what exactly had Divya said...

1374
01:41:01,132 --> 01:41:03,507
This marriage will continue only then,
else cancel.

1375
01:41:03,673 --> 01:41:04,465
Divya...

1376
01:41:05,215 --> 01:41:05,882
Divya...

1377
01:41:07,382 --> 01:41:08,215
Divya...

1378
01:41:11,507 --> 01:41:14,007
What, you felt like seeing so fast?
- Not that I wanted to see.

1379
01:41:14,173 --> 01:41:16,715
I came to ask
why you lied to me.

1380
01:41:17,757 --> 01:41:19,423
When did I lie to you?

1381
01:41:19,548 --> 01:41:22,673
The match you had got,
you refused him on his face, right?

1382
01:41:23,965 --> 01:41:25,465
I said....
- Is that true?

1383
01:41:25,715 --> 01:41:26,340
Yes, it's true.

1384
01:41:26,382 --> 01:41:28,340
Why are they saying it's a lie...
- Who said?

1385
01:41:29,882 --> 01:41:32,132
Come on, why are you hiding like that?

1386
01:41:33,090 --> 01:41:33,882
It's them...

1387
01:41:34,507 --> 01:41:35,507
You?

1388
01:41:38,757 --> 01:41:40,298
Kanna said he didn't like me...

1389
01:41:40,465 --> 01:41:43,840
I said to like him and said some lies not to
lose this match and somehow set this marriage up.

1390
01:41:44,007 --> 01:41:45,882
Instead of eating and going away...

1391
01:41:46,215 --> 01:41:48,382
Why are you ruining this match...
- Sorry Divya

1392
01:41:48,965 --> 01:41:51,132
Divya...
- Stop it.

1393
01:41:52,798 --> 01:41:55,257
What they said was true,
You lied to me.

1394
01:41:55,382 --> 01:41:56,548
Not that Baburao.

1395
01:41:56,673 --> 01:42:00,173
I said so with a fear to miss you,
but never to cheat you.

1396
01:42:00,423 --> 01:42:03,298
Still, I will not marry. You want me to marry a girl
rejected by someone else?

1397
01:42:04,090 --> 01:42:06,840
Is he so courageous
though there is a demand for his land

1398
01:42:07,257 --> 01:42:08,798
I thought he would never get married.

1399
01:42:09,007 --> 01:42:11,090
Ammu... stay here.

1400
01:42:11,465 --> 01:42:14,840
This marriage would be cancelled
if I do not go there.

1401
01:42:15,590 --> 01:42:16,673
Please...

1402
01:42:18,507 --> 01:42:21,507
I didn't mean to cheat you
- I am not listening to you...

1403
01:42:24,298 --> 01:42:25,423
Hello excuse me...

1404
01:42:28,465 --> 01:42:29,965
Can I talk to you?

1405
01:42:30,298 --> 01:42:31,715
Who are you?

1406
01:42:33,882 --> 01:42:37,215
I was the one who refused Divya
in the marriage looks.

1407
01:42:37,757 --> 01:42:40,423
But there is a strong reason for that.

1408
01:42:40,882 --> 01:42:41,757
What is that?

1409
01:42:44,632 --> 01:42:47,382
Can anyone say such a cute girl not good?

1410
01:42:48,382 --> 01:42:50,632
She is so beautiful sir..
- Ok...

1411
01:42:51,257 --> 01:42:53,298
That means my wife is
very beautiful right?

1412
01:42:54,507 --> 01:42:56,340
But still I will not marry.

1413
01:42:56,757 --> 01:42:59,715
What happened again sir?
- To believe you,

1414
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,257
I need to see friend of Divya
you are in love with right away.

1415
01:43:04,340 --> 01:43:06,132
No way out of this?
- No way.

1416
01:43:07,298 --> 01:43:08,548
Baby Ammu...

1417
01:43:09,423 --> 01:43:10,548
Dear...

1418
01:43:11,007 --> 01:43:12,173
Come out...

1419
01:43:16,007 --> 01:43:17,215
Oh...

1420
01:43:18,632 --> 01:43:20,590
What are they doing?

1421
01:43:22,132 --> 01:43:24,007
He is opened business in the box itself

1422
01:43:26,090 --> 01:43:27,423
What he said...
is that true?

1423
01:43:29,173 --> 01:43:31,173
Brother, I should say you a truth...

1424
01:43:31,382 --> 01:43:34,757
Not just you but even I would say
not to be liking after seeing such a beautiful girl.

1425
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:38,132
Sorry Divya...
I will marry you...

1426
01:43:38,257 --> 01:43:40,548
No more misunderstandings
between us from now.

1427
01:43:41,215 --> 01:43:42,007
Brother...

1428
01:43:42,465 --> 01:43:44,382
Is anyone else there in that still box?

1429
01:43:45,423 --> 01:43:46,923
Cool... cool brother...

1430
01:43:47,048 --> 01:43:48,173
Marry her...
- Ok sir...

1431
01:43:48,257 --> 01:43:51,382
It is time for the marriage,
bring the bride and groom

1432
01:43:51,507 --> 01:43:52,340
Let's go...
- Come...

1433
01:44:25,715 --> 01:44:28,590
"Hey, colorful parrot, heat gets on"

1434
01:44:28,673 --> 01:44:31,257
"Seeing your great beauty"

1435
01:44:37,215 --> 01:44:42,882
"Hey dear diamond, shall I come behind you
After you call with a whistle"

1436
01:44:49,090 --> 01:44:54,757
"It is a celebration, with you beside
I got the flowery bed ready"

1437
01:44:54,882 --> 01:45:00,298
"He is a mass guy and came rushing
He is the dashing Guntur guy"

1438
01:45:00,715 --> 01:45:06,257
"Seeing, he cuts off.
Be careful about your young age"

1439
01:45:06,423 --> 01:45:09,340
"Naughty 1000 volts guy
and is alone still in age"

1440
01:45:09,423 --> 01:45:12,382
"Care of the hot center
and is daring Guntur fellow"

1441
01:45:12,465 --> 01:45:15,090
"Naughty 1000 volts guy
and is alone still in age"

1442
01:45:15,257 --> 01:45:18,298
"Care of the hot center
and is daring Guntur fellow"

1443
01:45:18,382 --> 01:45:21,048
"It's time to chill now...
walk to the dance floor..."

1444
01:45:21,090 --> 01:45:23,923
"Put your hands up..."

1445
01:45:24,048 --> 01:45:26,882
"Here we go...
Break it. take it. get some more."

1446
01:45:26,965 --> 01:45:29,840
"Getting to the party mood
rock it dude"

1447
01:45:53,048 --> 01:45:56,298
"Hey, I am fire brand cracker,
baby you are the match stick"

1448
01:45:56,382 --> 01:45:58,923
"It is a breaking news
if we both become one"

1449
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:07,882
"My age is the airbus and you are my pilot"

1450
01:46:07,923 --> 01:46:10,590
"Let us do a jolly ride in the clouds"

1451
01:46:16,590 --> 01:46:19,715
"My hot chili romance is now with you"

1452
01:46:19,882 --> 01:46:22,548
"Let us become hot couples"

1453
01:46:22,715 --> 01:46:25,632
"He is a mass guy and came rushing"

1454
01:46:25,715 --> 01:46:28,340
"He is the dashing Guntur guy"

1455
01:46:28,673 --> 01:46:34,007
"Seeing, he cuts off.
Be careful about your young age"

1456
01:46:34,257 --> 01:46:37,090
"Naughty 1000 volts guy
and is alone still in age"

1457
01:46:37,173 --> 01:46:40,048
"Care of the hot center and is daring Guntur fellow"

1458
01:46:40,132 --> 01:46:43,007
"Naughty 1000 volts guy
and is alone still in age"

1459
01:46:43,048 --> 01:46:45,965
"Care of the hot center
and is daring Guntur fellow"

1460
01:47:15,048 --> 01:47:16,882
Seshu...
- Yes...

1461
01:47:17,923 --> 01:47:21,715
That kid fooled you.
He cheated you.

1462
01:47:23,298 --> 01:47:25,173
What happened?
- What has to happen?

1463
01:47:25,423 --> 01:47:27,340
He sent that video to CM...

1464
01:47:27,465 --> 01:47:28,715
He called me...

1465
01:47:29,007 --> 01:47:31,257
Even after saying so much,
what is he doing?

1466
01:47:31,507 --> 01:47:35,007
Such people are tough to survive in politics.
I can't take any decision as of now...

1467
01:47:35,257 --> 01:47:37,673
I am halting the ticket.
We shall see later.

1468
01:47:50,548 --> 01:47:53,673
All these days I thought it would be enough
If I kill the person who hit me.

1469
01:47:54,090 --> 01:47:56,715
But now seeing you, I want to kill you...

1470
01:47:57,048 --> 01:47:58,882
Thus I brought your dad.

1471
01:48:01,423 --> 01:48:02,673
I have some information for you.

1472
01:48:03,465 --> 01:48:08,048
There is no guarantee for your dad to be alive,
however fast you come.

1473
01:48:08,298 --> 01:48:10,798
My men are beating in such a range.

1474
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:15,090
Even while dying
he is taking your name saying Kanna.

1475
01:48:15,298 --> 01:48:16,257
Poor guy...

1476
01:48:16,548 --> 01:48:18,965
Come and save him.

1477
01:48:41,215 --> 01:48:42,715
Where is my dad?

1478
01:48:46,715 --> 01:48:48,090
Where is my dad?

1479
01:48:54,715 --> 01:48:58,090
You were the delivery boy
who came to my house that day

1480
01:48:59,923 --> 01:49:01,548
Where is my dad?

1481
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:07,798
Hey, I am warning you all.

1482
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:18,298
Where is my dad?

1483
01:49:25,173 --> 01:49:30,173
I am warning you all,
If something happens to my dad...

1484
01:49:30,257 --> 01:49:33,715
None of you here would be alive.

1485
01:49:35,173 --> 01:49:36,507
Will you kill us?

1486
01:49:36,673 --> 01:49:39,298
We are so many here,
it is difficult for you to be alive now.

1487
01:49:39,632 --> 01:49:42,840
Why is so much stubbornness still in you...

1488
01:49:43,507 --> 01:49:45,173
What will you do
if I show your dad...

1489
01:49:45,923 --> 01:49:47,632
Will you see?

1490
01:49:49,673 --> 01:49:52,007
Show him his father...

1491
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:21,173
Father...

1492
01:50:24,882 --> 01:50:27,007
What? are you scared?

1493
01:50:28,257 --> 01:50:30,298
We still did not kill your father...

1494
01:50:31,465 --> 01:50:34,632
Yes, it seems you are the life
of your father...

1495
01:50:35,090 --> 01:50:37,090
You too should have it, right?

1496
01:50:38,673 --> 01:50:40,882
I will kill him right before your eyes.

1497
01:50:41,382 --> 01:50:42,840
Save him if you can.

1498
01:54:01,465 --> 01:54:03,132
Hey...
- Stop Kanna...

1499
01:54:04,173 --> 01:54:04,965
Stop.

1500
01:54:06,007 --> 01:54:09,257
I would have killed you then
when you insulted my dad.

1501
01:54:10,007 --> 01:54:13,215
But, I stopped then
and now my dad stopped.

1502
01:54:15,965 --> 01:54:19,548
Do you know
why did you live twice?

1503
01:54:20,965 --> 01:54:24,257
I am not any delivery boy
as you thought.

1504
01:54:24,382 --> 01:54:26,632
I am the guy in love with your sister.

1505
01:54:32,923 --> 01:54:37,132
He and Amrutha are in love.
I don't like enemies in relation.

1506
01:54:38,007 --> 01:54:42,257
Amrutha is the daughter-in-law of our house
either you agree or not. This is fixed.

1507
01:54:43,882 --> 01:54:48,673
You came on to the roads losing MLA ticket
with a blow from my son.

1508
01:54:49,132 --> 01:54:51,090
If you are still the same...

1509
01:54:51,632 --> 01:54:54,590
I can't say what would happen
to you going ahead.

1510
01:54:54,798 --> 01:54:57,298
Think well and intimate about the marriage.

1511
01:54:57,798 --> 01:54:58,840
Hey, you asked what is my courage right?

1512
01:55:04,340 --> 01:55:09,340
Hey, you asked what is my courage right?

1513
01:55:09,465 --> 01:55:16,840
The guts, even death runs away
when a guy with gut faces it.

1514
01:55:17,590 --> 01:55:18,965
Come on dad...

1515
01:55:34,507 --> 01:55:35,798
Seshu...

1516
01:55:36,257 --> 01:55:41,673
You can mange even a husband
but not a lover boy.

1517
01:55:42,090 --> 01:55:44,215
You messed with the wrong guy.

1518
01:56:04,090 --> 01:56:08,590
Sorry Ammu, I did not say all these days
as I didn't want to give you tension.

1519
01:56:09,298 --> 01:56:11,215
But you should know it sometime.

1520
01:56:11,631 --> 01:56:14,965
Anyone would have love towards
their family members.

1521
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:18,506
Obviously, you too will have love
on your brother.

1522
01:56:19,298 --> 01:56:20,631
But when someone goes wrong,

1523
01:56:20,965 --> 01:56:24,381
I react in the same way...
if it is my friend or even my dad

1524
01:56:25,298 --> 01:56:28,465
I have no personal grudge
on your brother, Ammu.

1525
01:56:28,590 --> 01:56:30,131
I can understand Kanna.

1526
01:56:30,506 --> 01:56:33,923
But, what is the solution
if you keep fighting...

1527
01:56:35,048 --> 01:56:37,423
How would our marriage take place?

1528
01:56:38,465 --> 01:56:42,090
No way that I leave you Ammu.
I am the one to tie the knot in your neck.

1529
01:56:43,381 --> 01:56:45,548
You be happy without any tension. Ok?

1530
01:56:46,298 --> 01:56:47,006
Ok...

1531
01:56:49,348 --> 01:56:52,681
Looks like you are showing all the anger
over him on the whiskey.

1532
01:56:52,765 --> 01:56:55,056
Look, you already finished a full bottle.

1533
01:56:55,223 --> 01:56:57,515
I am drinking to think about
what I should do with him.

1534
01:56:57,598 --> 01:56:58,556
Give me a cigarette.
- Sir...

1535
01:57:03,890 --> 01:57:04,890
He hit me...

1536
01:57:05,348 --> 01:57:07,056
He made sure I didn't get the MLA ticket...

1537
01:57:07,140 --> 01:57:08,765
He moved around with my sister
and I didn't know...

1538
01:57:08,806 --> 01:57:10,640
I thought of killing him
just for hitting me.

1539
01:57:11,098 --> 01:57:13,140
What should I do
when he did so much?

1540
01:57:13,223 --> 01:57:16,765
When you are unable to anything to him means,
nobody can do anything to him.

1541
01:57:16,890 --> 01:57:21,098
I have seen many,
but this fellow looks very dangerous.

1542
01:57:21,390 --> 01:57:24,015
Either fear or respect is
nowhere to be seen.

1543
01:57:24,098 --> 01:57:27,348
If not what was his style of hitting
and what was his power?

1544
01:57:27,431 --> 01:57:30,806
He is like a father
to the original Guntur chili breed.

1545
01:57:31,848 --> 01:57:35,848
I feared my heart to stop.
It was strong and thus could withstand.

1546
01:57:37,265 --> 01:57:38,431
Koteswara Rao sir...

1547
01:57:38,973 --> 01:57:41,390
Put a proposal in your political circles.

1548
01:57:41,890 --> 01:57:45,473
He should have a son to marry Amrutha.

1549
01:57:46,390 --> 01:57:49,015
He should have enough guts
to get me MLA ticket.

1550
01:57:50,181 --> 01:57:52,681
I will give how much ever as dowry,
but I should get the ticket.

1551
01:57:52,806 --> 01:57:56,390
Amrutha, whom he loved more than my life
should never go to that Kanna.

1552
01:57:56,598 --> 01:57:58,473
Marriage should happen secretly.

1553
01:57:59,223 --> 01:58:01,181
I will finish him at the right time.

1554
01:58:02,348 --> 01:58:05,515
This is my plan...
- Super plan Seshu...

1555
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:08,265
Can we find such a match right now...

1556
01:58:09,473 --> 01:58:15,431
Seshu, a politician to win election needs crores

1557
01:58:15,890 --> 01:58:20,181
If you say to give as many crores he asks for,
he will give his son easily.

1558
01:58:21,140 --> 01:58:25,098
You will get a response by this time tomorrow
for this proposal.

1559
01:58:25,848 --> 01:58:31,140
But, will he be calm
when so much is happening?

1560
01:58:31,265 --> 01:58:34,223
That is why I am saying to do all this secretly
not letting him know.

1561
01:58:35,556 --> 01:58:38,431
Anyways, to be on the safe side,
I will divert him.

1562
01:58:38,556 --> 01:58:39,390
How?

1563
01:58:39,598 --> 01:58:43,140
I will get into an issue with him
saying my sister is kidnapped.

1564
01:58:46,181 --> 01:58:47,306
Come out...

1565
01:58:48,848 --> 01:58:50,181
I can't find Amrutha...

1566
01:58:50,473 --> 01:58:52,223
What have you done?
- What happened to Amrutha?

1567
01:58:52,806 --> 01:58:56,348
Look Mr Seshu, if we have to do something,
we would have done long back.

1568
01:58:56,473 --> 01:58:57,723
Amrutha is missing...

1569
01:58:57,931 --> 01:59:00,890
I have been searching from yesterday.
- Is this any new game?

1570
01:59:01,140 --> 01:59:06,473
Did you hide and playing a new plan?
- I expected you to get such a doubt on me.

1571
01:59:08,098 --> 01:59:10,681
Amrutha is my sister even before you entered.

1572
01:59:11,431 --> 01:59:15,306
If you have such a doubt,
bring Amrutha from wherever she is...

1573
01:59:16,056 --> 01:59:17,598
I will get her married to you.

1574
01:59:18,848 --> 01:59:22,473
He will roam  entire Guntur
like a mad fellow for Amrutha.

1575
01:59:26,931 --> 01:59:30,806
It is better to be more careful with him
during the marriage time.

1576
01:59:31,015 --> 01:59:35,640
His dad meets at the same time
when marriage will be happening here.

1577
01:59:50,181 --> 01:59:53,265
He would be at the hospital in a tension
for this father...

1578
02:00:01,306 --> 02:00:05,306
Amrutha will get married here.
- No opposition now for your sketch...

1579
02:00:05,515 --> 02:00:06,348
Cheers.

1580
02:00:15,015 --> 02:00:17,306
Yes Mr Koteswara rao,
this is minister Krishna Rao speaking.

1581
02:00:17,390 --> 02:00:19,556
Yes Krishna Rao sir...
- Greetings...

1582
02:00:19,640 --> 02:00:22,140
How are you doing?
- Super... super...

1583
02:00:22,515 --> 02:00:25,640
I am coming straight to the matter.
I got your proposal.

1584
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:28,723
After seeing the photo of that girl, my son...

1585
02:00:28,806 --> 02:00:31,265
Is sitting rigid not to marry
any other girl than her.

1586
02:00:31,515 --> 02:00:35,140
That is the situation.
So, I should do this marriage for my son.

1587
02:00:36,431 --> 02:00:37,181
Ok.

1588
02:00:37,431 --> 02:00:40,890
Ok, it is my responsibility
to get a ticket for that Seshu.

1589
02:00:41,181 --> 02:00:45,973
Will he give the amount as thought?
- I am giving you that guarantee sir,

1590
02:00:46,431 --> 02:00:50,015
You do not get tensed...
- What else when you are there?

1591
02:00:50,181 --> 02:00:51,431
But...

1592
02:00:52,223 --> 02:00:54,473
But, there is a small personal problem.

1593
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:57,556
We are thinking to get the marriage done secretly.

1594
02:00:57,681 --> 02:01:01,556
What sir, have we grown so big
not understanding that much?

1595
02:01:01,640 --> 02:01:03,181
Ok, ask him to make arrangements.

1596
02:02:02,140 --> 02:02:03,473
Wait...

1597
02:02:07,431 --> 02:02:11,806
Total 206 bones will be broken
with one blow.

1598
02:02:22,473 --> 02:02:23,306
What?

1599
02:02:24,015 --> 02:02:27,973
If you have any doubts take him to hospital
and get X-ray done.

1600
02:02:28,640 --> 02:02:32,056
Come and ask me
even if one bone is less in the count.

1601
02:02:40,390 --> 02:02:41,473
Hello brother-in-law!

1602
02:02:42,348 --> 02:02:45,265
Being in the cell itself,
I showed my network in Guntur.

1603
02:02:46,098 --> 02:02:50,223
Now I am out and how do you think
your tricks would go on?

1604
02:02:50,931 --> 02:02:54,223
You said to give my Amrutha in marriage to me
if I bring her, right?

1605
02:02:54,765 --> 02:02:57,723
There is your sister...
Will you get her  married to me...

1606
02:02:58,890 --> 02:03:00,390
Why don't you talk Seshu...

1607
02:03:00,806 --> 02:03:02,306
Will you get them married now or what?

1608
02:03:03,140 --> 02:03:06,890
Hey you...
- Seshu, no use from your anger.

1609
02:03:07,598 --> 02:03:09,681
I agree that you are very clever.

1610
02:03:10,015 --> 02:03:11,431
You planned a wonderful sketch.

1611
02:03:11,973 --> 02:03:15,848
You planned both, marriage of your sister
and your MLA seat to happen in one shot.

1612
02:03:16,223 --> 02:03:19,306
Still, you failed.
You know why?

1613
02:03:20,890 --> 02:03:22,598
He is clever than you.

1614
02:03:23,265 --> 02:03:26,348
Shall I tell you one thing?
All this was your plan,

1615
02:03:26,765 --> 02:03:28,223
But his setup.

1616
02:03:31,181 --> 02:03:33,265
Is your mind lost with the shock.

1617
02:03:34,681 --> 02:03:38,515
Your PA heard when you were
saying this plan to Koteswara Rao.

1618
02:03:39,056 --> 02:03:42,473
He is not so cruel though
he is working under you...

1619
02:03:42,681 --> 02:03:45,140
He said that matter to Kanna and his friends.

1620
02:03:45,348 --> 02:03:47,765
Kanna planned this after know the matter...

1621
02:03:48,848 --> 02:03:50,723
A great sketch to overtake you.

1622
02:03:50,765 --> 02:03:54,681
Ok, I will accept proposal of Seshu as you said.

1623
02:03:54,848 --> 02:03:56,890
But why all this?

1624
02:03:57,098 --> 02:04:01,140
Someone else if not you will accept this
and marry Amrutha

1625
02:04:01,265 --> 02:04:03,848
That is why blocking through you,

1626
02:04:04,098 --> 02:04:07,640
I will tie the knot to Amrutha
in the same marriage hall.

1627
02:04:08,640 --> 02:04:09,515
Ok...

1628
02:04:10,098 --> 02:04:11,306
Seshu.

1629
02:04:11,890 --> 02:04:15,765
You came to my house and acted great
saying your sister is missing.

1630
02:04:16,890 --> 02:04:19,931
We roamed all around Guntur
not for Amrutha,

1631
02:04:20,598 --> 02:04:23,140
But to call all our relatives
for this marriage.

1632
02:04:23,431 --> 02:04:26,890
Few from those here are my relatives.

1633
02:04:27,931 --> 02:04:32,431
Why am I being a Minister
doing all this for them.

1634
02:04:32,765 --> 02:04:34,640
It maybe a Million Dollar question to you,

1635
02:04:35,181 --> 02:04:39,515
Yes, matter is that this Surya narayana
is none other but my classmate.

1636
02:04:41,973 --> 02:04:46,348
We used to compete a lot
to be walking along with him.

1637
02:04:46,473 --> 02:04:48,056
He had so much following back then...

1638
02:04:48,431 --> 02:04:52,931
He was always the unanimous SPL.
I had the desire to become SPL in those days.

1639
02:04:53,015 --> 02:04:55,681
Once I went to him and said
I wanted to become SPL for once.

1640
02:04:55,723 --> 02:04:58,181
When asked to leave once for me,
he just moved aside...

1641
02:04:59,515 --> 02:05:00,765
He made me SPL.

1642
02:05:07,390 --> 02:05:09,765
He gives so much value for friendship.

1643
02:05:10,348 --> 02:05:13,473
Though I grew so much in life,
never once...

1644
02:05:14,640 --> 02:05:15,973
Never asked me for help at least once.

1645
02:05:16,265 --> 02:05:17,056
That is...

1646
02:05:17,848 --> 02:05:19,223
His persona.

1647
02:05:19,973 --> 02:05:21,765
For the first time in life,

1648
02:05:22,640 --> 02:05:24,515
He asked me help
for his son's love.

1649
02:05:26,098 --> 02:05:30,056
Added it is a good work
and how I can deny Seshu?

1650
02:05:32,098 --> 02:05:36,765
Still, this fellow is so clever, sharp
and added won the heart of your sister.

1651
02:05:37,306 --> 02:05:39,306
What is your problem
to give your sister to him?

1652
02:05:40,390 --> 02:05:42,223
He hit me...
- Come on...

1653
02:05:42,265 --> 02:05:45,223
Saying like a kid that he hit you.
He said the matter of hitting you.

1654
02:05:45,431 --> 02:05:49,473
You keep saying filthy language and keep hitting,
will they not hit you...

1655
02:05:50,015 --> 02:05:52,431
Anybody would change
when they get hit once,

1656
02:05:52,681 --> 02:05:54,181
But you didn't change.

1657
02:05:54,556 --> 02:05:56,223
Ok wait...
Hey Kanna...

1658
02:05:57,181 --> 02:06:00,431
Say him sorry for once.
He is big guy and is egoistic.

1659
02:06:00,806 --> 02:06:01,931
Look he is feeling it.

1660
02:06:02,515 --> 02:06:04,598
I said uncle,
but he is not listening.

1661
02:06:05,140 --> 02:06:06,140
He will listen now...

1662
02:06:08,015 --> 02:06:08,723
Brother-in-law...

1663
02:06:09,556 --> 02:06:10,598
Sorry brother-in-law...

1664
02:06:13,265 --> 02:06:14,140
See...

1665
02:06:15,098 --> 02:06:18,931
Seshu, you wish to grow in politics. Fine.

1666
02:06:19,348 --> 02:06:23,640
Truly well educated and people
from noble profession should come into politics.

1667
02:06:24,015 --> 02:06:27,181
I will convince CM sir
and get that ticket to you.

1668
02:06:27,556 --> 02:06:29,473
To grow in politics... here...

1669
02:06:30,473 --> 02:06:33,973
People like him should be behind you
but not the corrupt like¦

1670
02:06:36,556 --> 02:06:38,598
Why all these,
forget about it.

1671
02:06:40,098 --> 02:06:41,431
Brother...

1672
02:06:41,806 --> 02:06:43,515
I like you very much.

1673
02:06:43,931 --> 02:06:46,765
I always feel all should say
great about you.

1674
02:06:46,931 --> 02:06:48,515
I can't take it when someone says
bad about you

1675
02:06:48,681 --> 02:06:51,931
I like Kanna a lot brother.

1676
02:06:56,723 --> 02:06:59,056
Kanna, matter is over...

1677
02:06:59,681 --> 02:07:01,390
He changed face expression.

1678
02:07:02,765 --> 02:07:05,015
Tie the knot as per your plan.

1679
02:07:05,223 --> 02:07:06,265
Suri...

1680
02:07:06,348 --> 02:07:07,556
Take him.

1681
02:07:11,598 --> 02:07:13,056
Brother-in-law...
- No need...

1682
02:07:14,473 --> 02:07:15,223
Tie the knot

1683
02:07:16,431 --> 02:07:17,098
Let's go...

1684
02:07:17,306 --> 02:07:18,348
Remove your shoe...

1685
02:07:21,181 --> 02:07:22,848
It is fine with you right?
- Ok.

1686
02:07:33,598 --> 02:07:38,223
Our Guntur Kanna made everyone dance...

1687
02:07:38,431 --> 02:07:40,515
If he has to stay happy like this...

1688
02:07:40,640 --> 02:07:44,515
It is better to be careful
so that his hands don't itch.

1689
02:07:51,598 --> 02:07:52,890
Dear...

1690
02:07:53,598 --> 02:07:56,348
My daughter... my stress buster...

1691
02:07:56,640 --> 02:07:56,640
You are back.
