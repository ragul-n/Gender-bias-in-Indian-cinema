1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:00,042
24.024 Fps

2
00:02:52,368 --> 00:02:55,407
"No, can't move this week.
Got lots of work"

3
00:02:56,531 --> 00:03:00,070
Breakfast is ready.
- I'll see Ma first

4
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:08,643
"Life's strange, no?"

5
00:03:08,644 --> 00:03:11,850
"We had nothing, yet we had
everything. Because I had you"

6
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:17,469
Now I got everything and all I have
is nothing... Because you're no more

7
00:03:21,423 --> 00:03:26,668
Guess why I'm telling you all this?
You left me when I was six

8
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:34,534
"20 years after,
you look just the same"

9
00:03:34,535 --> 00:03:40,528
"And look Ma, how I've changed"

10
00:03:40,529 --> 00:03:47,106
"Remember my birthday? Say, what gift
will you give me this year"

11
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:52,851
"Every year, you sent me gifts...
gifts from God. And this year?"

12
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:59,718
Will you? Won't you?

13
00:04:21,697 --> 00:04:29,438
Headlines. The new foreign policy and
a breakthrough in computer technology

14
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:34,767
No news?
- The new cricket team

15
00:04:35,224 --> 00:04:41,218
London-based Rajesh Purushottam Mittal
is businessman of the year

16
00:04:41,968 --> 00:04:45,338
Indians and people of Indian origin
all over the world take pride...

17
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:48,878
in the fact that an Indian has bagged
England's most prestigious award

18
00:04:49,293 --> 00:04:54,413
Rajesh Mittal will be presented
the award on the 20th of this month

19
00:05:55,227 --> 00:05:59,890
Ma... do you see?
Papa is alive

20
00:06:01,555 --> 00:06:05,051
And you thought he never came back
because of whatever befell him

21
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:13,209
He was only too busy doing whatever
and it has reaped a reward for him

22
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:20,411
"And I kept wondering why I'm alive?
What for? And nice of God, no...?"

23
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:25,448
He denied me my mother's love
and now He gives me a father

24
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:31,358
"You were no widow, I was no orphan
so I'm going to London, right away"

25
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:35,186
"And you got to come along.
Else, how will he recognize me?"

26
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:38,225
He doesn't even know
that he has a son

27
00:06:38,226 --> 00:06:42,681
Shekhar...
- You're on the first flight to London

28
00:07:57,314 --> 00:08:02,059
Why are you staring?
Are you seeing me for the first time?

29
00:08:02,476 --> 00:08:04,632
Me...?

30
00:08:05,597 --> 00:08:12,049
"Cut the crap. Why not even a phone,
a fax for so long? Not done, friend"

31
00:08:13,256 --> 00:08:16,878
Lady...
- Are we getting formal?

32
00:08:17,252 --> 00:08:22,705
"All of a sudden, after all the jokes
we shared, am I a stranger? My bag"

33
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:30,406
"If you're suffering from amnesia,
why not see a good doctor?"

34
00:08:34,776 --> 00:08:41,437
"How could I forget you, my first love?
Are first loves forgettable?"

35
00:08:43,351 --> 00:08:49,179
"Had you not turned up, I'd be so upset
that I'd return to Bombay"

36
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,964
Oh am I glad to see you!
I can't tell you in as many words

37
00:08:55,547 --> 00:09:01,124
So let my lips speak

38
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:45,248
"Ma told me all about you,
she showed me your photo"

39
00:09:46,288 --> 00:09:53,447
"So I know who you are, my love
and don't we go back a long time?"

40
00:10:02,231 --> 00:10:09,640
"No fax, no Xerox, no telex,
no floppies"

41
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:16,258
"I'm just my Papa's
carbon copy"

42
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:14,282
Is this any time to turn up?
- What...?

43
00:11:14,283 --> 00:11:19,445
Show me your invitation

44
00:11:22,734 --> 00:11:26,854
"By the way, who are you?
- Maybe you got amnesia"

45
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:31,100
Why not see a doctor?
- You fancy gate-crashing?

46
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,679
You fancy someone lugging your luggage?
- So... quits?

47
00:11:39,383 --> 00:11:42,422
"What kind of a name is Sony?
- No, I'm Sonia"

48
00:11:58,573 --> 00:12:06,440
I'm elated. But the credit goes
to my father Purushottam Mittal

49
00:12:07,522 --> 00:12:13,641
I followed the path he showed me
and here I am

50
00:12:14,515 --> 00:12:18,511
"This award is the outcome of his
principles, the upbringing he gave me"

51
00:12:20,676 --> 00:12:26,669
"Daddy, come up on stage"

52
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:32,079
Daddy... grandfather...?

53
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,908
Fortunate is a man who sees his son
overtake him up the ladders of success

54
00:12:39,532 --> 00:12:47,065
"A fortunate father, I am
and I'm proud of my son Rajesh"

55
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:57,138
"More than my son, I'm proud that
an Indian who has won this award"

56
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:19,617
A woman is behind my success.
At my every step what inspired me...

57
00:13:20,324 --> 00:13:27,484
"was her love, her companionship...
none other than my wife Smita Mittal"

58
00:13:43,176 --> 00:13:48,546
I'm very fortunate
to have Smita for my wife

59
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:56,205
I too am most fortunate
to have him for my husband

60
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:07,444
"Last but not the least,
the apples of my eyes..."

61
00:14:07,984 --> 00:14:12,439
"my daughter Rinke and my son, Bunty.
Join me, my children"

62
00:14:25,217 --> 00:14:30,670
God save us from the evil eye

63
00:14:50,484 --> 00:14:56,228
You loved him till your last breath?
But he forgot you long ago

64
00:14:57,561 --> 00:15:02,431
"Now he loves someone else.
To you, he was no husband"

65
00:15:02,846 --> 00:15:05,218
"To me, he was no father"

66
00:15:05,219 --> 00:15:10,796
He's someone else's father.
He's someone else's husband

67
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,848
"Thanks, brother.
- Why thank a brother?"

68
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:25,637
"Come, let's have coffee"

69
00:16:25,638 --> 00:16:32,964
You're his son. He will be glad
to see you. He's your father

70
00:16:33,423 --> 00:16:36,835
He can't be a bad man.
- How can you be sure?

71
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:40,748
You don't even know him.
- But one thing I know

72
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:47,532
Your father is an Indian.
An Indian never betrays his family

73
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:54,027
"We might not be so wealthy,
but at heart, we're rich"

74
00:16:54,484 --> 00:16:58,106
"Come on, I'll tell you a story"

75
00:17:24,413 --> 00:17:27,658
A lone star...

76
00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:30,448
shines...

77
00:17:31,739 --> 00:17:34,819
shows the way

78
00:17:36,775 --> 00:17:42,686
The shining star...

79
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:49,554
is my Hindustan

80
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:28,016
From East to West...

81
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:32,012
travels the light

82
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:36,258
"India holds her own
even in London"

83
00:19:23,418 --> 00:19:29,996
"From afar, we traveled
to this alien land..."

84
00:19:30,912 --> 00:19:37,738
"carrying a message
from our homelands"

85
00:19:38,528 --> 00:19:41,984
Here riches galore...

86
00:19:42,524 --> 00:19:46,022
but be true to love

87
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,851
"That's the message
which has stirred this alien land"

88
00:19:50,267 --> 00:19:53,472
"India holds her own
even in London"

89
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,307
"We're from the land
where love lives in hearts"

90
00:20:32,683 --> 00:20:36,721
"Ties of love are never broken,
relationships are never broken"

91
00:20:40,341 --> 00:20:46,460
"Then why did I think
this is an alien land?"

92
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:54,452
Your words give me courage

93
00:20:56,325 --> 00:21:01,362
"What made you think
this is an alien land?"

94
00:21:03,527 --> 00:21:10,770
"But I'm happy
if I've given you courage"

95
00:21:11,352 --> 00:21:15,182
Life is tied to relationships

96
00:21:19,552 --> 00:21:25,463
My land has touched my life

97
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:34,454
Yours will become a legend

98
00:21:34,912 --> 00:21:40,406
"India holds her own
even in London"

99
00:21:48,523 --> 00:21:51,562
From East to West...

100
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:55,973
travels the light

101
00:21:55,974 --> 00:21:59,763
"India holds her own
even in London"

102
00:22:46,257 --> 00:22:49,503
Do I look British?
Talk to a Hindustani in Hindustani

103
00:22:49,504 --> 00:22:54,083
I'll use Punjabi. Where to?
- What's up there?

104
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:58,536
Mr. Mittal's residence.
- So I must be going to see him

105
00:22:58,537 --> 00:23:01,866
As if you own that mansion?
- You could say so

106
00:23:01,867 --> 00:23:05,237
Indeed? You got an appointment?
- No

107
00:23:05,238 --> 00:23:08,318
Then you can't see him.
- It's urgent. I'm related to him

108
00:23:08,735 --> 00:23:11,231
Ever since he won the award...

109
00:23:11,232 --> 00:23:15,353
every Indian is into the business
of getting related to him. Scoot

110
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,641
Step aside.
- Who's that?

111
00:23:18,642 --> 00:23:22,804
"Some relative! You don't know
who Mr. Mittal is? Hey, where to?"

112
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:30,296
The problem about being rich
are the relations you spawn

113
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:34,709
Never will I buy a mansion.
I'd rather stay a gatekeeper

114
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,475
"Sir, I'm from India.
I've come to see you"

115
00:24:41,476 --> 00:24:46,095
"Like this...? Who are you?
- Sir, I'm Raju and I'm from India"

116
00:24:46,595 --> 00:24:47,552
So...?

117
00:24:51,132 --> 00:24:55,502
I'm Meghna Saxena's son

118
00:24:55,503 --> 00:24:57,750
Meghna Saxena...?
- Yes sir

119
00:24:57,751 --> 00:24:59,998
So you're Meghna's son?
- Yes

120
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,244
What name did you say?
- Raju

121
00:25:03,245 --> 00:25:06,658
Been ages since I saw Meghna.
Glad to meet you

122
00:25:07,532 --> 00:25:11,070
"When I was in India,
Meghna and I were good friends"

123
00:25:12,903 --> 00:25:18,105
"Just friends, sir?
- Yes, 25 years ago. Afterwards..."

124
00:25:18,521 --> 00:25:24,891
I never got a chance to see her.
- Never got a chance? Or never wanted?

125
00:25:25,556 --> 00:25:29,844
"Circumstances were such...
anyway, how's Meghna?"

126
00:25:30,885 --> 00:25:36,379
She's no more

127
00:25:39,251 --> 00:25:43,413
How is your Daddy?
- Fine

128
00:25:44,037 --> 00:25:46,285
What is he doing?
- Whatever you're doing

129
00:25:46,286 --> 00:25:47,616
Businessman?
- Yes

130
00:25:47,617 --> 00:25:49,489
What business?
- Same as yours

131
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:52,821
Really? What's his name?
- Same as yours

132
00:25:53,237 --> 00:25:55,067
R.P. Mittal...?
- Yes

133
00:25:55,068 --> 00:26:00,603
What a coincidence!
- Worth a handshake?

134
00:26:00,604 --> 00:26:04,726
What nonsense...!
- Not at all. You are my father

135
00:26:07,389 --> 00:26:12,467
Nice way to make money.
- I'm not interested in your money

136
00:26:12,925 --> 00:26:19,253
"All I'm interested in, is you.
- How clever! You want an inheritance"

137
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:25,495
What proof of being my son?

138
00:26:25,496 --> 00:26:26,787
Look

139
00:26:27,494 --> 00:26:30,532
What a scoundrel!
You've been plotting

140
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:33,612
"Are you using a photo?
Why of course, I knew Meghna"

141
00:26:33,613 --> 00:26:38,150
"Please, look closely.
I resemble my Ma"

142
00:26:40,481 --> 00:26:45,185
"Yes, you look like your mother!
But not like me. Come on..."

143
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:49,722
That's my son and he resembles me
but you don't resemble me

144
00:26:50,263 --> 00:26:54,093
You can put me to a DNA test.
- No. And don't come looking for me

145
00:27:00,503 --> 00:27:05,414
"Look, I understand your problem.
You got a family"

146
00:27:07,496 --> 00:27:11,242
"For once, just tell me that
I'm your son and I'll go away"

147
00:27:11,617 --> 00:27:16,986
"And never again will I show my face.
Please, for my mother's sake..."

148
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:23,604
You are talking like a fool!
Why should I accept you as my son?

149
00:27:23,605 --> 00:27:28,849
"Well, if you're adamant,
then it's your genes I carry"

150
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:34,053
"And one day, you will recognize
me as your son"

151
00:27:35,426 --> 00:27:40,420
What will you do?
What can you do?

152
00:27:40,421 --> 00:27:45,375
Want to see?

153
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:51,242
If you won't accept me
as your son...

154
00:27:51,243 --> 00:27:56,862
I will shake the very foundations
of your family

155
00:28:10,641 --> 00:28:13,512
Robin! Are you laughing at me?
I got a serious problem

156
00:28:13,513 --> 00:28:17,217
"How naive, Rajesh.
He must be a fraud looking for money"

157
00:28:17,676 --> 00:28:21,796
What evidence of your parentage?
- He asked for a DNA test

158
00:28:22,212 --> 00:28:25,625
And there's no deny that
I had a relationship with Meghna

159
00:28:25,626 --> 00:28:28,873
Then why didn't you marry her?
- I was scared of Daddy

160
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:33,618
"Before migrating, I promised Meghna
I'd speak to Daddy about marriage"

161
00:28:34,034 --> 00:28:37,530
Little did I know that Daddy
had already finalized a match for me

162
00:28:37,531 --> 00:28:41,110
And no one refutes Purushottam Mittal
and I know all that. At his age...

163
00:28:41,527 --> 00:28:45,606
"if he still rages, I can guess
what he might've been 25 years ago"

164
00:28:47,312 --> 00:28:50,017
So I kept my silence.
And after 25 years...

165
00:28:50,018 --> 00:28:53,473
the silence returns to my life
in a pandemonium. What am I to do?

166
00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:57,552
"If your family gets wind of this,
you're finished"

167
00:28:57,553 --> 00:29:01,840
Smita will abandon you.
So will your kids

168
00:29:02,256 --> 00:29:05,043
And your father is going
to throw you out

169
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:08,125
You will have no standing left.
Your stock prices are doomed

170
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:13,120
"After businessman of the year,
you will be called fraud of the year"

171
00:29:13,537 --> 00:29:17,241
You're ruined!
- Are you scaring me?

172
00:29:17,658 --> 00:29:22,111
"Take it as you will, but find him,
coax him into returning to India"

173
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:25,232
I hope he doesn't turn up at your
doorstep. All I can give you is counsel

174
00:29:25,233 --> 00:29:29,271
"Rest, up to you.
Come on, get in the car"

175
00:29:36,138 --> 00:29:37,762
What poise

176
00:29:48,126 --> 00:29:53,538
You...? Why have you come here?
- Where will son go if not to Daddy?

177
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:57,659
Who...?
- Not to be unnerved

178
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:02,737
I'll bring about a family reunion.
- Don't you dare call me Dad

179
00:30:03,111 --> 00:30:09,772
Dad... Daddy... Father dear...
- Such endearment is killing

180
00:30:10,271 --> 00:30:14,100
And don't think I'm going to accept
you. What proof have you?

181
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,887
"Looking for proof? I'll provide proof,
in front of everyone"

182
00:30:17,888 --> 00:30:20,260
Is Grandpa at home?
- Maybe... why?

183
00:30:20,261 --> 00:30:25,631
Grandfather... Grandpa...
stepmother...

184
00:30:28,836 --> 00:30:31,790
"Rinke, don't go by what he says!
He's a fraud"

185
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:37,411
But this photograph
can't be a fake

186
00:30:38,285 --> 00:30:42,697
No Rinke... Bunty...
I'm not what you think

187
00:30:42,863 --> 00:30:46,693
"That's the sad part, Dad.
You aren't what we thought you are"

188
00:30:50,273 --> 00:30:53,685
"Smita, whatever you heard...
don't believe what he said"

189
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:58,098
I have lost faith on the man
I worshipped like a god

190
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:01,553
Son of a gun!
- Whom can I trust now?

191
00:31:01,554 --> 00:31:06,132
Stepmother... trust me.
He isn't worthy of your trust

192
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:10,544
"He has deceived you,
because of him my mother died"

193
00:31:10,545 --> 00:31:13,583
Home-wrecker

194
00:31:13,584 --> 00:31:16,580
Daddy...
- Don't you dare call me Daddy

195
00:31:16,581 --> 00:31:21,117
I have no son. You are a criminal!
A murderer! You killed his mother

196
00:31:21,534 --> 00:31:25,155
"And you have broken my trust,
and your wife's trust"

197
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:29,151
You have betrayed your children.
Purushottam Mittal never forgives...

198
00:31:29,526 --> 00:31:33,854
"certainly not a criminal,
no matter even if he's my son"

199
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:40,597
"From this day, we will have nothing
to do with you"

200
00:31:41,556 --> 00:31:43,843
Throw him out

201
00:31:43,844 --> 00:31:46,508
No! Not so heartlessly

202
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:50,671
My golf bag! It's expensive!
What are you doing?

203
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:57,497
My wardrobe! Those dresses
are expensive

204
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:02,740
What are you doing?
What's going on?

205
00:32:02,741 --> 00:32:05,155
My shoes...
- You're lucky... you deserve...

206
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:08,528
"getting beaten up with a boot!
- Buta Singh, you too...?"

207
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:13,107
As long as you belonged to the family
you were my boss. Now you're a stranger

208
00:32:13,524 --> 00:32:16,603
I recognize only your father.
If I see you around ever again...

209
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:20,517
remember my stick.
- You too...?

210
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:26,469
"Don't worry Dad, we'll put up a sale
of your belongings on the sidewalk"

211
00:32:30,547 --> 00:32:39,414
No! No sparing you! Scoundrel! Cur!
- No sparing...? Whom? What's up?

212
00:32:39,829 --> 00:32:43,617
That devil is after me!
- Daddy...

213
00:32:45,283 --> 00:32:50,403
Why did you turn up?

214
00:32:53,524 --> 00:32:59,643
"He's surely disturbed,
obviously he's afraid"

215
00:33:00,517 --> 00:33:03,554
"What are you saying, Khanna?
What could he be afraid of?"

216
00:33:03,555 --> 00:33:06,928
"Something on his mind, that he
can't bring himself to speak"

217
00:33:07,428 --> 00:33:13,338
But he has never
hidden anything from us

218
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:18,707
"No, no. Work is important.
But health is more important"

219
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:22,912
"Don't worry, I'll write a prescription.
He'll be fine tomorrow morning"

220
00:33:23,412 --> 00:33:27,365
"As of now, he needs rest"

221
00:33:27,366 --> 00:33:32,568
"Bunty, switch off the lights"

222
00:33:51,507 --> 00:33:55,212
You took ill last night?
The doctor saw you?

223
00:33:55,213 --> 00:33:58,335
"Not to worry, I'll be there tomorrow.
You'll love to see your big boy"

224
00:33:58,751 --> 00:34:04,287
How did you get my bedroom number?

225
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:11,946
Where did he transpire from?

226
00:34:19,521 --> 00:34:24,268
What's that crowd?
- Managers being interviewed

227
00:34:39,501 --> 00:34:44,788
What are you doing here?
- You're hiring a stranger?

228
00:34:45,163 --> 00:34:52,073
Instead of your son?
- It's a job for a highly qualified man

229
00:34:52,488 --> 00:34:57,235
What have you got to show?
- Something no one else got to show

230
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:02,021
What do you mean?
- Your name. You're boss because...

231
00:35:05,227 --> 00:35:10,720
you're Purushottam Mittal's son. And
I'm his grandson. So I'm taking over

232
00:35:11,511 --> 00:35:15,798
My word...!
- Thank you sir

233
00:35:15,799 --> 00:35:21,501
My dead Ma's soul will bless you

234
00:35:30,118 --> 00:35:33,739
What is it that you want?
- Take me home to my family

235
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:40,690
As if that's so easy? Do I tell them
that I picked a puppy on my walks?

236
00:35:41,232 --> 00:35:44,811
"Okay, I'll tell them myself.
- Oh no... sit"

237
00:35:46,351 --> 00:35:49,806
"Look, I need some time.
- How much time?"

238
00:35:50,472 --> 00:35:55,218
"20 years, 25 maybe.
- Long enough to be dead and gone?"

239
00:35:56,466 --> 00:36:00,254
7 days was what you promised my Ma.
I'll give you 7 days. Day Eight...

240
00:36:00,712 --> 00:36:06,082
I'm coming home to you

241
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:11,202
All right.
- Put me up in a fancy hotel

242
00:36:13,532 --> 00:36:18,694
And give me a thousand pounds

243
00:36:18,736 --> 00:36:22,231
You brought him here? What do you
take my house for? An orphanage?

244
00:36:22,232 --> 00:36:25,519
You don't get this! He's threatening!
If I don't put him up somewhere...

245
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,309
he'll come home to me.
- Put him up in a hotel

246
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:31,681
Impossible! My credit card will
be charged. If Daddy gets wind...

247
00:36:32,139 --> 00:36:35,677
he's going to throw me out.
- You're his son and you're afraid?

248
00:36:36,218 --> 00:36:39,464
I'm his legal advisor. He'll throw me
out of London. Sorry

249
00:36:39,465 --> 00:36:44,044
I won't entertain your follies.
- I came hoping...

250
00:36:44,501 --> 00:36:50,079
"you'd help me out of my predicament.
Well Robin, you're still my only friend"

251
00:36:50,495 --> 00:36:54,200
"So what if you aren't a friend in need?
- Look, no emotional blackmail"

252
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,155
"Okay, but no more than a week.
- Thanks Robin"

253
00:36:58,571 --> 00:37:02,067
Mention not and send him over.
- I brought him along

254
00:37:02,483 --> 00:37:04,189
Where...?
- In my car

255
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,395
In your car...? Are you crazy?
- That's what he's doing to me

256
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:14,304
Raju... where's he gone?
- Must've gone home

257
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,467
"If that turns out to be true...
- Good riddance, I say"

258
00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:21,839
"Not so soon, Dad.
- No Daddy-ing me"

259
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,128
This is your uncle Robin Singh.
And he's the one... Raju

260
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:30,579
You're living with him.
I'm getting late. Excuse me

261
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:35,076
"Don't be late coming back to me.
On Day Eight, I'm coming home to you"

262
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:39,279
Some soup

263
00:37:43,151 --> 00:37:44,816
Pick your bags.
- Who me...?

264
00:37:44,817 --> 00:37:47,479
Call a bell boy.
- Are you raving?

265
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,060
"Is this a self service hotel?
- Mister, this is my house"

266
00:37:51,476 --> 00:37:53,807
And mind your language.
I'm not your Daddy's servant

267
00:37:53,808 --> 00:37:57,804
I'm his legal advisor.
- My illegal father's legal advisor?

268
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,634
Can I ask something?
- What...?

269
00:37:59,635 --> 00:38:02,798
Is the law business slack?
- What makes you say that?

270
00:38:02,799 --> 00:38:05,753
You've turned a perfectly lovely house
into a hotel?

271
00:38:05,754 --> 00:38:09,084
"This is no hotel, this is my house!
And I'm putting you up for a week"

272
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:12,580
Because your Daddy begged me!
- One more question...?

273
00:38:12,996 --> 00:38:19,489
Go on.
- How did you lose all that hair?

274
00:38:19,615 --> 00:38:25,900
"Sonia, my child...
allow me..."

275
00:38:29,271 --> 00:38:31,602
You know each other?
- Intimately

276
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:37,056
We've met. Once at the airport
and once at the award function

277
00:38:37,513 --> 00:38:40,926
"And now here in this hotel.
What are you, housekeeping?"

278
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:44,255
One minute... this is no hotel.
This is my home and I own it

279
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:48,628
She's my daughter and Raj is
putting up for no more than a week

280
00:38:49,251 --> 00:38:51,540
"Come on Raj, let me show you
to your room"

281
00:38:51,541 --> 00:38:58,035
May I have two glasses of milk? Quick.
- Two glasses... milk...?

282
00:38:58,701 --> 00:39:02,655
"Here's your room. But tell me,
how come you're here?"

283
00:39:05,235 --> 00:39:09,024
I'm consulting your Daddy.
The verdict should be in a week

284
00:39:09,398 --> 00:39:17,265
"First, my verdict. This is his room.
And you aren't seeing each other"

285
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:26,297
"In that case, let's go out"

286
00:39:48,234 --> 00:39:51,730
Bewitching eyes

287
00:39:51,731 --> 00:39:55,435
Bewitching words

288
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:59,057
"Most bewitching,
your heart..."

289
00:39:59,515 --> 00:40:06,882
throbbing inside my heart

290
00:41:26,303 --> 00:41:30,049
"Now's our time,
now is the season..."

291
00:41:30,548 --> 00:41:33,712
of our passions

292
00:41:34,212 --> 00:41:37,750
"Whatever happens,
let it happen"

293
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:41,413
This is our time

294
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:53,193
I'm pining

295
00:41:53,692 --> 00:41:57,439
I'm eager

296
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,890
The flame of our love...

297
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:09,593
is burning...

298
00:42:11,341 --> 00:42:16,336
inside my heart

299
00:42:37,732 --> 00:42:45,015
"An irrepressible storm
rages under my breath"

300
00:42:45,515 --> 00:42:52,758
"Don't hold yourself back, my love
I could even die for you"

301
00:42:53,632 --> 00:42:57,212
I can't live without you

302
00:42:57,753 --> 00:43:01,208
In you I seek refuge

303
00:43:12,655 --> 00:43:17,067
Like a monsoon deluge...

304
00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:24,102
your love is raining on me

305
00:43:30,804 --> 00:43:34,465
Bewitching eyes

306
00:43:34,466 --> 00:43:37,754
Bewitching words

307
00:43:37,755 --> 00:43:44,414
"Most bewitching,
your heart..."

308
00:43:47,911 --> 00:43:53,863
throbbing inside my heart

309
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:20,420
How many times have I warned you?
No more credit until you settle dues

310
00:44:21,128 --> 00:44:24,582
"But you keep coming back,
romancing at my expense"

311
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:27,871
"I'll pay you back with interest.
- No, I want it today"

312
00:44:28,245 --> 00:44:33,199
"Why won't you trust him, junior?
If he says he'll repay, he will"

313
00:44:33,657 --> 00:44:39,776
"No Big Brother, he thinks we're fools
to let him drink and gamble..."

314
00:44:40,233 --> 00:44:44,063
"have fun with girls, at our expense.
On blow is enough to kill him..."

315
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,729
Stop

316
00:44:47,477 --> 00:44:48,974
Why?
- If I'm dead...

317
00:44:48,975 --> 00:44:51,472
you can't recover.
Give me one more chance

318
00:44:51,473 --> 00:44:55,177
"Yes, we can always kill him
some other day"

319
00:45:04,209 --> 00:45:07,498
Give that to me.
- My game isn't over

320
00:45:07,873 --> 00:45:10,536
"When Vicky takes over,
your game's over. Get lost"

321
00:45:10,537 --> 00:45:13,658
You're Indian?
- So...?

322
00:45:13,659 --> 00:45:17,821
Courtesy is always offering
someone else the first go

323
00:45:18,195 --> 00:45:22,816
And you insist on going first?
- Culture lectures for India. Shove

324
00:45:23,232 --> 00:45:26,520
One more courtesy.
- What...?

325
00:45:26,521 --> 00:45:30,766
"First, you try to reason
like a gentleman, use words"

326
00:45:31,182 --> 00:45:36,843
"If he still doesn't get it,
use hands"

327
00:45:40,674 --> 00:45:41,922
All nine

328
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:48,998
Vicky isn't here yet.
- Should be coming

329
00:45:51,496 --> 00:45:56,573
"Here I come, Daddy"

330
00:45:56,574 --> 00:45:59,987
Here he is.
- Hi Vicky! Welcome

331
00:46:01,236 --> 00:46:03,483
What's he up to?

332
00:46:03,484 --> 00:46:04,774
Bless you

333
00:46:05,815 --> 00:46:09,436
Careful Dad.
He's going to trip you

334
00:46:10,102 --> 00:46:14,556
"Long time, no see?
- I was a bit busy at work"

335
00:46:15,013 --> 00:46:18,301
Busy philandering

336
00:46:18,302 --> 00:46:25,212
Your father and Rajesh were very
close friends. He is no more

337
00:46:26,211 --> 00:46:30,457
But we would like the friendship
to continue as a relationship

338
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:36,034
The two of you are in love.
As a member of the family...

339
00:46:36,451 --> 00:46:41,737
you will ably assist
in our businesses

340
00:46:42,153 --> 00:46:46,399
"No sir, people will think
I married for money"

341
00:46:46,608 --> 00:46:50,187
I want to do something on my own.
I want to become someone like him

342
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:01,800
"Dear Daddy, my obeisances"

343
00:47:02,467 --> 00:47:05,713
May I come over
to the family reunion?

344
00:47:06,129 --> 00:47:09,376
Where are you speaking from?
- Out of my mouth. Turn your head

345
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:35,433
What are you doing here?
- Let's talk over there

346
00:47:35,434 --> 00:47:38,555
Nowhere! What are you doing here?
- Pursuing you

347
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:43,342
Why...?
- It's my sister's wedding

348
00:47:45,715 --> 00:47:50,043
"You want me to end up divorced?
- You'll do that in two days, no?"

349
00:47:50,461 --> 00:47:53,457
Five days. Over.
- I still have two days

350
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:59,909
We're discussing a wedding.
Please... not right now

351
00:48:06,486 --> 00:48:10,399
Daddy... I must tell you something.
- Go on

352
00:48:11,189 --> 00:48:16,435
I made a mistake.
- My son made a mistake?

353
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:24,093
"Daddy, it happened long ago...
when I was in India"

354
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:30,503
Who's that?
- Pammi's daughter

355
00:48:30,504 --> 00:48:35,206
What happened to her?

356
00:48:35,207 --> 00:48:39,036
"What happened, my child?
- Uncle... Daddy..."

357
00:48:39,495 --> 00:48:43,116
But he was fine yesterday.
- Nothing happened to him.

358
00:48:43,533 --> 00:48:47,319
Only his 20 year old affair is out

359
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:52,107
What...? But he wasn't like that!
Must be a misunderstanding

360
00:48:52,939 --> 00:48:57,767
"No, he confessed to his wife
about an affair with his secretary..."

361
00:48:58,184 --> 00:49:02,429
"they married,
they have kids too"

362
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:06,051
Your Mummy must be devastated.
- She was hospitalized

363
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:09,547
Why?
- Overdose of sleeping tablets

364
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:13,876
Why do our women punish themselves
for the wrongs of their husbands?

365
00:49:14,293 --> 00:49:18,787
He's should've been poisoned

366
00:49:18,788 --> 00:49:22,867
"Papa, men like him ought to be whipped
on Trafalgar Square"

367
00:49:23,284 --> 00:49:26,655
Such double crossers ought to be
put on show in Wembley Stadium

368
00:49:27,072 --> 00:49:32,524
What rot! I mean... Daddy shouldn't
the children mind their words?

369
00:49:32,941 --> 00:49:37,936
"Principle-wise, he's right. That's how
men like him ought to be punished"

370
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:42,432
"In his place, you would've
suffered a similar fate"

371
00:49:52,837 --> 00:49:57,624
Day Seven ends. I'm going to have
breakfast with your family. Tomorrow

372
00:50:03,328 --> 00:50:06,530
Back again? Where are you headed?
- No stopping me today

373
00:50:06,531 --> 00:50:09,903
"This morning, the first face
I saw in the mirror was mine..."

374
00:50:09,904 --> 00:50:12,900
and I knew instinctively
that a mishap is brewing

375
00:50:12,901 --> 00:50:15,897
You may go right in. But no use.
- Why...?

376
00:50:15,898 --> 00:50:18,020
No one's at home.
- Where's everybody?

377
00:50:18,021 --> 00:50:21,392
Big Boss is away in America.
His son is holidaying. En famille

378
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:24,347
Where...?
- How would I know?

379
00:50:24,348 --> 00:50:28,094
Why wouldn't you know?
- Who's the boss? He or I...?

380
00:50:28,551 --> 00:50:34,921
When will they be back?
- Not again! I don't know

381
00:50:36,295 --> 00:50:40,456
"First you deserted my mother,
now you're deserting your son"

382
00:50:44,328 --> 00:50:46,532
Was he raving?

383
00:50:46,533 --> 00:50:53,651
"What gives, son? Is my house cozier
than Daddy's home? You're back...?"

384
00:50:54,525 --> 00:50:59,188
He has disappeared. En famille.
- So what will you do now?

385
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:04,266
I'm returning to India

386
00:51:04,267 --> 00:51:10,759
"You can have your laugh. Your Daddy
married your Ma, gave you his name"

387
00:51:12,424 --> 00:51:16,046
Will the man who disowned my mother
ever accept me?

388
00:51:16,545 --> 00:51:21,498
I'm sorry; but wonderful decision.
I wish I could do something for you

389
00:51:21,957 --> 00:51:25,702
"Had I been your Daddy,
I would've accepted you"

390
00:51:25,703 --> 00:51:29,075
Want me to pack a meal for you?
A big Mac or a pizza?

391
00:51:29,532 --> 00:51:34,195
"Will you manage on your own?
If you want, I can drop you"

392
00:51:34,652 --> 00:51:40,521
"I'll manage on my own.
- Quick, or you'll miss the flight"

393
00:51:41,812 --> 00:51:43,601
Robin here

394
00:51:44,809 --> 00:51:51,053
"Must be bad news. Has he splashed it
all over the papers, or is it the TV?"

395
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:55,007
None. Your trouble has flown to India.
- Really...?

396
00:51:56,256 --> 00:52:03,414
"It wasn't easy though. I reasoned,
I lectured him and finally, he got it"

397
00:52:11,448 --> 00:52:15,236
Thanks won't do.
This warrants something special

398
00:52:15,237 --> 00:52:18,566
Come right over. With Sonia.
I'll treat you to the best of wines

399
00:52:19,067 --> 00:52:20,272
Anybody home?

400
00:52:20,273 --> 00:52:22,436
Robin Uncle!
- I'm not listening to your song

401
00:52:22,437 --> 00:52:26,350
Please...
- No way

402
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:29,805
"My baby! How are you?
No, Bunty, not your songs! Please"

403
00:52:31,929 --> 00:52:35,257
Robin Uncle! I've scored 40 songs!
Won't you listen?

404
00:52:35,258 --> 00:52:39,378
"Spare me, son.
- Robin Uncle is here to relax"

405
00:52:43,043 --> 00:52:46,496
Where's Sonia?
- She's fetching the luggage

406
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:49,869
"Bunty, some other time...
- I'm treating you to a fine wine"

407
00:52:57,402 --> 00:53:00,774
"Raju... you...?
Hey Raju, get up"

408
00:53:04,687 --> 00:53:11,430
You scared me.
- Scared? I'll wipe out that scare

409
00:53:12,554 --> 00:53:15,759
Friend indeed! You removed
the thorn in my side

410
00:53:16,217 --> 00:53:21,088
Give me a hug

411
00:53:24,126 --> 00:53:28,621
What happened?

412
00:53:30,536 --> 00:53:34,574
"Hello Daddy!
Wonderful, am I not?"

413
00:53:40,526 --> 00:53:43,273
What have I done?
- Hotshot lawyer?

414
00:53:43,273 --> 00:53:46,561
Your license ought to be revoked.
A kid got you fooled

415
00:53:46,562 --> 00:53:52,639
You've put me in a fix I want to evade!
- This boy isn't a simpleton

416
00:53:53,055 --> 00:53:59,257
His father must've been
a scoundrel of the first order

417
00:54:01,296 --> 00:54:05,751
"Smita, Rinke, Bunty! They're here!
If he exposes me, I'm ruined"

418
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:11,953
"You should've considered that before.
- Yes, it was a mistake, but..."

419
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:17,073
"If you're King, I'm ace"

420
00:54:17,656 --> 00:54:21,069
"You still got time, recant"

421
00:54:21,694 --> 00:54:29,268
"I respect this relationship
but don't think I'm afraid"

422
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:33,598
Now we're going to court

423
00:54:34,181 --> 00:54:37,636
Don't you try to buy me out

424
00:54:38,218 --> 00:54:41,882
"Daddy dear, try to understand
what I mean"

425
00:54:42,297 --> 00:54:45,710
"Else, I'm going to
leave you dumbfounded"

426
00:54:45,711 --> 00:54:53,662
"No fax, no Xerox, no telex,
no floppies"

427
00:54:54,244 --> 00:54:59,114
"I'm just my Papa's
carbon copy"

428
00:55:17,638 --> 00:55:19,967
What's going on?
- Raju is our host. We're playing...

429
00:55:19,968 --> 00:55:24,546
"Who wants to be a millionaire
- Let's play "Million Dollar Question"

430
00:55:24,547 --> 00:55:29,083
"Robin, sit with us"

431
00:55:29,084 --> 00:55:33,912
So let's play
Who wants to be a millionaire

432
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:38,742
"Rinke, name the movie in which
Amitabh Bachchan ruins his Daddy"

433
00:55:40,406 --> 00:55:43,486
A. Deewar
B. Trishul

434
00:55:43,487 --> 00:55:46,899
C. Kaalia
D. Natwarlal

435
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:47,899
Trishul

436
00:55:50,229 --> 00:55:52,976
We lock that away?

437
00:55:52,977 --> 00:55:57,346
"Computer-ji, lock B. Trishul"

438
00:55:57,347 --> 00:56:01,426
Absolutely correct

439
00:56:01,427 --> 00:56:04,965
"Ms Rinke I'm so happy you've won.
- Raju, next question for me"

440
00:56:05,506 --> 00:56:08,294
"No, let him quiz me.
- No, it's me"

441
00:56:08,295 --> 00:56:10,750
Our next contestant is Ms Smita.
Welcome

442
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:15,412
Me...?
- Yes

443
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:19,199
"Ms Smita, have you seen
Wife Number One?"

444
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,488
Yes.
- In Karishma Kapoor's place...

445
00:56:22,489 --> 00:56:25,611
what would you have done?
A. Divorce

446
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:34,061
B. Poison your husband's lentil soup.
C. Forgive him

447
00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:39,389
"If you have any confusion,
you can use your life-lines"

448
00:56:39,847 --> 00:56:43,467
Fifty-fifty. Phone-a-friend.
Or Audience Poll

449
00:56:43,468 --> 00:56:47,089
I'd like to use Phone-a-friend.
- Who would you like to phone?

450
00:56:47,506 --> 00:56:54,207
My husband. Raj.
- Okay. Call up Mr. R.P. Mittal

451
00:56:54,624 --> 00:56:57,161
"Mr. Mittal, I'm Amitabh Bachchan from
Who wants to be a millionaire"

452
00:56:57,162 --> 00:57:00,492
I haven't time for this nonsense

453
00:57:00,493 --> 00:57:03,155
"Mr. Mittal, everyone knows
you're a very busy man"

454
00:57:03,156 --> 00:57:05,653
But you must spare time
for your wife

455
00:57:05,654 --> 00:57:08,734
"Next, you will hear your wife
and you have just 30 seconds"

456
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:13,438
"Your time starts now.
- Raj, in the heroine's place..."

457
00:57:13,813 --> 00:57:21,097
"should I have divorced, or walked out,
or poisoned my husband or forgiven him?"

458
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:27,799
Forgive him... no?
What else? Forgive him

459
00:57:31,337 --> 00:57:37,164
"Tell me, would you go by your husband?
Or will it be an independent decision?"

460
00:57:37,622 --> 00:57:42,076
You still have two lifelines left.
Fifty-fifty. And Audience Poll

461
00:57:42,534 --> 00:57:47,529
Try Fifty-fifty

462
00:57:49,194 --> 00:57:51,233
You're saved

463
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:55,687
"If you went along with your husband,
you would've lost, forgiven him"

464
00:57:56,187 --> 00:58:00,515
Divorcing would also be wrong.
Now you're left with two options

465
00:58:00,516 --> 00:58:04,387
Walking out?
Or poisoning him?

466
00:58:06,469 --> 00:58:10,714
Think. Because in this game
time is no factor

467
00:58:11,172 --> 00:58:13,127
Audience Poll

468
00:58:13,128 --> 00:58:17,539
Audience Poll

469
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:21,204
Let's hear what the audience says.
Should Smita walk out on her husband?

470
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:25,949
"Or, should she poison his lentil soup?
- Poison him"

471
00:58:28,654 --> 00:58:31,110
Time out

472
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:34,606
Serve dinner.
- Why end the discussion?

473
00:58:34,607 --> 00:58:38,311
Shut up and eat.
- Some lentil soup?

474
00:58:38,312 --> 00:58:41,266
Why aren't you taking lentil soup?
It's your favorite

475
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:45,554
"No, I prefer pasta.
- I hope the lentil soup isn't poisoned"

476
00:58:48,427 --> 00:58:52,963
"Son, buttered bread for you?
Your plate is absolutely empty"

477
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:58,458
You remind me of my mother.
Even she never fed me so lovingly

478
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:02,829
Where is your mother?
- She's no more

479
00:59:05,326 --> 00:59:08,322
And your Papa?
- Very close to me

480
00:59:08,323 --> 00:59:12,153
"Very close...?
- He means, very close to his heart"

481
00:59:13,526 --> 00:59:17,148
"What does your Papa do?
- Jockey, cabbie, salesman, whatever"

482
00:59:17,522 --> 00:59:20,728
How are you concerned?
- Why are you getting worked up?

483
00:59:21,518 --> 00:59:24,306
What an ill-timed conversation!
Let's eat

484
00:59:24,307 --> 00:59:29,468
"There's a time for everything.
- Let's eat, then we go to bed"

485
00:59:30,551 --> 00:59:33,172
You've piled up your plate...
- Even you are talking too much

486
00:59:33,173 --> 00:59:36,502
Eat. You have to leave.
- But where will Raju go?

487
00:59:36,503 --> 00:59:39,916
"Wherever! How are we concerned?
- Dad, Raju came with us"

488
00:59:40,291 --> 00:59:44,453
Let him stay on.
- No strangers allowed in the family

489
00:59:46,285 --> 00:59:50,655
At times even small things
are a matter of embarrassment

490
00:59:50,656 --> 00:59:57,066
"Ms Smita, in you I see my Ma,
in him, a father"

491
00:59:57,524 --> 01:00:03,518
"And in them, a brother and a sister.
I felt as if I'm here with my family"

492
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:09,179
"Aunt! Stop Raju! Dad, Raju lived
with us when we were in London, no?"

493
01:00:10,261 --> 01:00:17,088
You see... his father and I are great
friends. So I had to accommodate him

494
01:00:17,545 --> 01:00:21,042
"So what's the problem now? Mummy...
- Yes Aunt, tell them"

495
01:00:21,541 --> 01:00:26,327
Raju isn't going anywhere.
He's staying right here

496
01:00:26,328 --> 01:00:32,156
"Now, why did we stop the quiz?
- How do I know? Eat"

497
01:00:40,231 --> 01:00:44,851
Sonia isn't in her room! Raju isn't
in his room. Have they eloped?

498
01:00:48,264 --> 01:00:53,301
Sonia! What have you done to yourself?
- I'm Bunty. Uncle how about a song?

499
01:01:31,929 --> 01:01:34,509
"Come slowly,
stir me restless"

500
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:37,423
"Stir me restless,
make my heart throb"

501
01:01:37,424 --> 01:01:42,085
"My heart's empty,
I want to have fun"

502
01:01:42,711 --> 01:01:46,789
"Crazy-crazy
...my heart's crazy about you"

503
01:03:04,254 --> 01:03:09,207
"Oh that killer figure,
those killer eyes..."

504
01:03:09,831 --> 01:03:14,661
"bewitching me slowly,
but now I'm gone too far"

505
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:25,233
"It's a treacherous time,
so why be shy?"

506
01:03:25,732 --> 01:03:30,561
"Crazy-crazy
...my heart's crazy about you"

507
01:04:27,045 --> 01:04:32,040
"You cast a spell on me
and I gave in to you..."

508
01:04:32,541 --> 01:04:37,202
"and now everyone's talking about us
...look they've lost their hearts"

509
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:47,816
"I swear,
this is so breathtaking"

510
01:04:48,483 --> 01:04:52,894
"Crazy-crazy
...my heart's crazy about you"

511
01:05:08,629 --> 01:05:11,292
"Come slowly,
stir me restless"

512
01:05:11,293 --> 01:05:14,206
"Stir me restless,
make my heart throb"

513
01:05:14,207 --> 01:05:18,994
"My heart's empty,
I want to have fun"

514
01:05:19,494 --> 01:05:24,197
"Crazy-crazy
...my heart's crazy about you"

515
01:05:50,463 --> 01:05:55,041
"I'm doomed! Your son has ruined me!
- Why, what happened?"

516
01:05:55,458 --> 01:06:01,742
He's romancing my daughter
and what-not! My only daughter

517
01:06:02,117 --> 01:06:05,489
Are you accusing Bunty?
He's just a kid!

518
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:11,442
"Not Bunty... Raju!
- Robin, I'm hassled no less"

519
01:06:12,316 --> 01:06:15,895
He keeps threatening! He'll expose me!
What am I going to do...?

520
01:06:16,312 --> 01:06:20,433
Idea! Let's destroy the evidence!
- How...?

521
01:06:21,015 --> 01:06:25,219
Come with me

522
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:28,882
Hurry up before someone comes in!
- Found it

523
01:06:29,299 --> 01:06:33,337
What...?
- His visa expired 8 days ago

524
01:06:34,127 --> 01:06:38,373
The immigration officials
are going to extradite him

525
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:43,451
But what are we supposed to do?
- Not a thing. The police will do...

526
01:06:43,452 --> 01:06:48,862
whatever is to be done!
- I see

527
01:07:06,469 --> 01:07:09,549
Doesn't he seem familiar?
- The same guy...

528
01:07:10,008 --> 01:07:12,503
who claims to be your son.
Wasn't he romancing my daughter?

529
01:07:12,504 --> 01:07:16,377
So he is the one!
- You can have your laugh

530
01:07:17,499 --> 01:07:21,746
"All these days, you've had your laughs
at my expense. Now it's my turn"

531
01:07:22,619 --> 01:07:27,990
"Akbar, the Emperor. He walked
barefoot, praying for a son"

532
01:07:28,406 --> 01:07:31,901
And look at me! What a father!

533
01:07:31,902 --> 01:07:35,150
Not to be too elated.
- Why? What will you do?

534
01:07:35,606 --> 01:07:38,437
Will you put up posters in India
saying I'm your father?

535
01:07:38,437 --> 01:07:42,808
Or will you scream it from rooftops?
He can't do a thing

536
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:49,634
I'm coming back with another visa.
- You aren't getting any visa

537
01:07:53,132 --> 01:07:59,292
I'm R.P. Mittal's son

538
01:08:01,373 --> 01:08:06,909
R.P. Mittal's son! My word!

539
01:08:08,283 --> 01:08:11,528
I want to live all over again

540
01:08:11,529 --> 01:08:14,776
I want to die all over again

541
01:08:15,235 --> 01:08:18,479
What gives?
- The holiday is working wonders for me

542
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:22,061
I'm washed of all my sins!
I've been baptized

543
01:08:26,722 --> 01:08:29,927
Days of sorrow are no more

544
01:08:29,928 --> 01:08:34,173
Whom do you want to see?
- What do you mean?

545
01:08:34,174 --> 01:08:37,753
"Buta Singh, have you forgotten me?
- It's a boy, sir"

546
01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:42,083
He has been trying to get in and
maybe he's masquerading as you...?

547
01:08:43,207 --> 01:08:46,910
No one's coming anymore

548
01:08:46,911 --> 01:08:51,613
"Daddy, look who's here!
- Coming"

549
01:08:51,614 --> 01:08:55,443
"Why are you screaming?
Well, who's here?"

550
01:09:02,394 --> 01:09:05,641
You...? How come you're here?
- I brought him

551
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:08,888
You...?
- I met him at the airport

552
01:09:08,889 --> 01:09:11,178
They were deporting him to India

553
01:09:11,179 --> 01:09:11,761
Grandpa...

554
01:09:16,215 --> 01:09:18,544
"What's up?
- Grandpa, I'm Raju"

555
01:09:18,545 --> 01:09:19,543
"Raju, who...?"

556
01:09:19,544 --> 01:09:24,456
"You're Mr. Purushottam, aren't you?
Mr. Rajesh Mittal's father...?"

557
01:09:26,205 --> 01:09:29,743
I'm like a son to him.
That makes you my grandfather

558
01:09:30,242 --> 01:09:32,530
And his wife loves me
like her own son

559
01:09:32,531 --> 01:09:35,527
"Rinke and Bunty adore me too,
like an elder sibling"

560
01:09:35,528 --> 01:09:40,108
Uncle Robin and Sonia love me too.
- No son of the Mittals will be hurt...

561
01:09:40,523 --> 01:09:46,851
as long as Purushottam Mittal lives.
So much influence I wield in the U.K.

562
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:50,555
I called the embassy
and I got his visa extended

563
01:09:51,512 --> 01:09:53,260
You did...?

564
01:09:53,261 --> 01:09:57,465
In U.K. No injustice will be done
to an Indian...

565
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,961
"as long as Purushottam Mittal lives.
Besides, he is related to you"

566
01:10:03,709 --> 01:10:06,496
He told you everything?
- I never had to

567
01:10:06,497 --> 01:10:10,325
Grandpa made me out

568
01:10:10,326 --> 01:10:13,615
I see...
- That was a great thing to do

569
01:10:16,529 --> 01:10:19,693
Where are you staying? Do drop in
or maybe a call once in a while...?

570
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:23,980
Drop in where?
He's staying right here

571
01:10:23,981 --> 01:10:26,518
He's here because he wants to make it
like you did. To do that...

572
01:10:26,519 --> 01:10:30,639
"he must live with you, no?"

573
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:36,759
You said I'd never get a visa?
I got a visa right into your home

574
01:10:37,175 --> 01:10:43,460
And who validated my visa? Grandpa.
You told me to shout from rooftops...?

575
01:10:43,836 --> 01:10:47,540
I'll scream it from your rooftop and
I'll plaster your walls with posters

576
01:10:47,957 --> 01:10:52,575
Until such time that...

577
01:10:52,576 --> 01:10:58,862
you own up and say that my mother
was your wife and I am your son

578
01:11:28,124 --> 01:11:31,912
Aren't you stopping me?
- No stopping one who's already in

579
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:35,533
Will you tell me who you are?
- My Daddy's son

580
01:11:36,075 --> 01:11:39,403
So who's Daddy?
- I haven't yet told Grandpa that

581
01:11:39,404 --> 01:11:44,316
How can I tell you?
- Was he trying to make a point?

582
01:11:49,936 --> 01:11:53,224
"Here you are, Grandpa.
Duets of Saigal and Suraiya"

583
01:11:55,014 --> 01:11:58,967
Where did you find them?
- Perchance

584
01:11:58,968 --> 01:12:02,048
"Son, I haven't had a chance
to talk with you"

585
01:12:02,049 --> 01:12:06,877
Let's talk now...?
- Where's your Daddy?

586
01:12:08,209 --> 01:12:09,832
There

587
01:12:12,039 --> 01:12:15,868
No one's there.
- You can't see him. Only I can

588
01:12:16,409 --> 01:12:18,989
What do you mean?
- It's said that after my Ma died...

589
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:25,400
he left me. But I still see him.
Just like I see him

590
01:12:26,191 --> 01:12:29,353
But no one's...

591
01:12:29,354 --> 01:12:33,184
Daddy is right here and only I can
see him... as he sees me

592
01:12:33,559 --> 01:12:37,263
No one else can see him.
- You love him so much?

593
01:12:38,013 --> 01:12:41,341
I only pray every father
has a son like you

594
01:12:41,342 --> 01:12:44,589
How old were you when
your Daddy left you?

595
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:49,584
I wasn't even born then

596
01:12:49,585 --> 01:12:55,328
God rest his soul

597
01:12:59,658 --> 01:13:03,194
Daddy! Don't fall at my feet!
- Shut up

598
01:13:03,195 --> 01:13:07,858
You just made my Daddy pray for the
soul of his son! And I'm still alive

599
01:13:09,939 --> 01:13:13,309
My watch! Why are you wearing mine?
- Now it's mine

600
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:15,974
"As if it belongs to your Dad!
- Yes, my stepmother gave it to me"

601
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:20,303
What spell have you cast upon her?
But remember...

602
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:24,425
the expensive watch doesn't mean
that you've hit good times

603
01:13:24,966 --> 01:13:28,878
"At least it marks the changing times
in your case, bad; mine are good"

604
01:13:29,378 --> 01:13:33,956
But it's only a watch. Watch how
I take things from you one at a time

605
01:13:33,957 --> 01:13:39,826
Why...?
- Time-pass

606
01:13:41,949 --> 01:13:47,360
Do I see a famous singer exercising?
- Dad hates my music

607
01:13:48,067 --> 01:13:52,854
Only when you sing it in English.
I'll write a Hindi song for you

608
01:13:53,312 --> 01:13:56,518
Sing it and he'll give you a big hug!
- Go right ahead and write it up

609
01:14:00,514 --> 01:14:03,926
"Breakfast is ready. Where's Bunty?
- Dad, I want to sing a song"

610
01:14:03,927 --> 01:14:07,922
How many times have I told you?
I don't want to hear your songs

611
01:14:07,923 --> 01:14:10,544
"Come on, give him an audience.
- Is it worth hearing...?"

612
01:14:10,545 --> 01:14:13,875
"Just listen. What's come over you?
Go on son, sing"

613
01:14:16,622 --> 01:14:22,074
What is this?

614
01:14:22,574 --> 01:14:24,156
Great

615
01:14:50,214 --> 01:14:57,165
"There was a king and his queen
and what a great life they had"

616
01:14:57,915 --> 01:15:01,494
"But in his youth, the king
had made a great mistake..."

617
01:15:01,827 --> 01:15:05,199
"and he paid for it dearly
in his ageing years"

618
01:15:17,936 --> 01:15:21,515
Stop singing these rotten songs!
- What have you done?

619
01:15:21,932 --> 01:15:25,179
"Dad, why did you break my guitar?
- Next time you sing a rotten song..."

620
01:15:25,345 --> 01:15:29,549
I'll break your arms and legs.
- Is this how you behave with kids?

621
01:15:29,965 --> 01:15:33,462
"Poor thing, all he did was sing a song.
- And what's come over you of late?"

622
01:15:34,003 --> 01:15:37,333
Why are you getting irked over every
little thing? Take him to a doctor

623
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:43,160
He badly needs treatment

624
01:15:45,908 --> 01:15:48,155
How went the song?
- Forget it

625
01:15:48,156 --> 01:15:51,110
This was the first time I sang and
he broke my guitar. Next time...

626
01:15:51,111 --> 01:15:55,481
he'll break my bones.
- Now I get this feeling...

627
01:15:55,939 --> 01:15:58,936
that it's a conspiracy
to nip your talent in the bud

628
01:15:58,936 --> 01:16:02,015
What conspiracy?
- If you become a singer...

629
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:07,593
who will work for the Mittals for free?

630
01:16:07,594 --> 01:16:09,966
Now I know! But what am I to do?

631
01:16:09,967 --> 01:16:13,255
"Put up a fight.
- No, I'd hate hitting Dad"

632
01:16:13,256 --> 01:16:16,334
"No, it's a fight for your rights.
Look at that house"

633
01:16:16,335 --> 01:16:19,624
"You own it too, don't you?
Pick your share and walk"

634
01:16:19,957 --> 01:16:22,953
Score an album with the money.
- But whom do I ask for my share?

635
01:16:22,954 --> 01:16:26,200
Go to court.
- What if it makes Dad angry?

636
01:16:26,201 --> 01:16:30,863
"Forget Daddy. Rajesh Mittal, the man
you're fighting is your adversary"

637
01:16:31,529 --> 01:16:34,275
"Go and say,
Rajesh Mittal, give me my share"

638
01:16:34,276 --> 01:16:38,605
"Rajesh Mittal, please give me my share.
- Are you asking for lollipop?"

639
01:16:38,855 --> 01:16:41,309
No...
- Then say it with conviction

640
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:45,224
"Rajesh Mittal, give me my share.
- Now take the Mittal out of it"

641
01:16:45,973 --> 01:16:48,969
Rajesh! Give me my share!
- Cut out the regard for your father

642
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:52,341
Rajesh! Give me my share!
- Pep it up

643
01:17:03,247 --> 01:17:07,076
You want your share?
- No Dad! I don't want my share

644
01:17:07,077 --> 01:17:08,367
Moron

645
01:17:11,614 --> 01:17:15,652
"I thrashed Bunty, all because of Raju!
- It's only Bunty who has rebelled"

646
01:17:15,901 --> 01:17:18,980
"If you don't prevent this soon enough,
your entire family will revolt"

647
01:17:18,981 --> 01:17:22,268
"Before that, I'll kill that scoundrel.
- Spoken like a man!"

648
01:17:22,269 --> 01:17:26,058
"That's the only way out.
- Hey, that just slipped out"

649
01:17:26,307 --> 01:17:29,261
"Can I ever do that?
- In that case, I'll do it"

650
01:17:29,262 --> 01:17:32,051
You mean...?
- A few of my clients...

651
01:17:32,052 --> 01:17:35,881
"will do anything for money. This too.
- What are you saying, Robin?"

652
01:17:36,631 --> 01:17:42,832
"Whether or not I accept him,
he's still my son. I can't kill him"

653
01:17:43,207 --> 01:17:46,496
Who's talking about killing him?
Let's just break some bones

654
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:50,241
"He'll get scared and he will run away.
- No, I don't like all this"

655
01:17:50,949 --> 01:17:55,612
"He's wrecking homes, yours and mine.
- How come...?"

656
01:17:55,903 --> 01:17:59,815
He's seducing my only daughter
If I don't stop him soon enough...

657
01:18:00,148 --> 01:18:05,851
I'll lose my daughter and you'll
lose your family. Give me his photo

658
01:18:07,017 --> 01:18:12,636
"You fancied belonging to
my family, didn't you? Now watch..."

659
01:18:13,011 --> 01:18:16,466
how I cut you off
from my family

660
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,870
"Look, how beautiful my family looks
...without you"

661
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:36,529
"Deliver this photo to Uncle Robin.
- Raju, isn't it?"

662
01:18:36,945 --> 01:18:40,941
"Yes, but don't you tell anyone!
This is a secret. Family secret"

663
01:18:47,226 --> 01:18:50,305
Where to...?
- To Uncle Robin

664
01:18:50,306 --> 01:18:54,593
What for...?
- Can't tell you. It's a secret

665
01:18:54,594 --> 01:18:57,965
"I'm no stranger. Tell me,
it'll still remain a secret"

666
01:18:57,966 --> 01:19:02,127
If I told you that Dad asked me to
deliver your photo to Uncle Robin...

667
01:19:02,128 --> 01:19:05,833
Dad will thrash me again!
- My photograph? Show me

668
01:19:06,082 --> 01:19:08,579
Look.
- What a moron you are

669
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:10,411
Why...?
- Such a great secret!

670
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:13,825
"How can you carry it openly?
Wait, I'll put it in an envelope"

671
01:19:15,073 --> 01:19:19,611
"Raju, my brother! You're swell!
You just saved me a scalping"

672
01:19:19,944 --> 01:19:24,938
Thank me.
- Thank you

673
01:19:24,939 --> 01:19:28,934
Bash him up!
Make him leave London

674
01:19:28,935 --> 01:19:32,431
He's the one...?
- You don't know. He's a scoundrel

675
01:19:32,847 --> 01:19:35,678
He's romancing my daughter!
- This one...?

676
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,925
Yes! He takes her in his arms
and he sings songs

677
01:19:37,926 --> 01:19:40,381
"This one...?
- Yes, my daughter wants to marry him"

678
01:19:40,382 --> 01:19:43,461
Is your daughter blind?
- Blinded in love

679
01:19:43,462 --> 01:19:48,873
Please! Save my daughter!
Here's your fee. 5000 pounds

680
01:19:57,365 --> 01:20:00,861
"Dad, I want to become a singer,
not athlete"

681
01:20:01,236 --> 01:20:04,690
"Moron! Look at you, so heavy!
You don't even fit your clothes"

682
01:20:05,398 --> 01:20:10,601
"Stop it, Dad"

683
01:20:47,938 --> 01:20:50,478
He's beating Dad...!

684
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:56,888
I'll show him... oh no
I'll get bashed up

685
01:20:58,927 --> 01:21:02,840
Daddy wants to see his son dead.
And here's a son...

686
01:21:03,174 --> 01:21:06,878
who can't bear to watch Daddy
taking a beating. Now watch...

687
01:21:07,044 --> 01:21:10,292
"this scoundrel son of yours.
Come on, man"

688
01:21:11,665 --> 01:21:16,992
What soap do you use?

689
01:21:16,993 --> 01:21:22,404
"Daddy, he packs a mean punch"

690
01:21:59,326 --> 01:22:02,322
Let go of him.
- No Grandpa

691
01:22:02,323 --> 01:22:05,610
I'm not sparing him!
He assaulted your son

692
01:22:05,611 --> 01:22:08,940
"He made a mistake.
I mean, he wasn't trying to kill me"

693
01:22:08,941 --> 01:22:11,853
Whom was he trying to kill?
- He wasn't trying to kill anyone

694
01:22:11,854 --> 01:22:15,767
"No one. Actually, he was mugging me.
- The way he bashed you up..."

695
01:22:15,976 --> 01:22:22,178
Shut up!
- One minute... let him confess it

696
01:22:23,968 --> 01:22:27,381
Forget it Daddy!
- Shut up

697
01:22:27,382 --> 01:22:28,297
Talk

698
01:22:34,623 --> 01:22:37,412
"Who sent you?
- Daddy, for nothing..."

699
01:22:37,413 --> 01:22:38,496
Clam up

700
01:22:44,905 --> 01:22:49,941
Your dearest friend...?
- My lawyer...?

701
01:22:49,942 --> 01:22:52,938
What are you doing?
- Ingrate

702
01:22:52,939 --> 01:22:56,934
You paid him to kill my son?
- No

703
01:22:56,935 --> 01:23:00,223
"Grandpa, he's just a pawn.
The prime mover is someone else"

704
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:03,261
"Don't you butt in. Stay out.
- Grandpa, you must ask him..."

705
01:23:03,262 --> 01:23:07,590
who's behind all this?
- Who is he...?

706
01:23:09,256 --> 01:23:14,666
I'll flay you alive! Talk.
- I sent him to hit Raju

707
01:23:16,041 --> 01:23:20,535
Me...? What have you got against me?
- I know! I know everything

708
01:23:20,952 --> 01:23:24,698
He's behind all this!
He's in love with Robin's daughter

709
01:23:24,990 --> 01:23:28,694
But he doesn't approve of Raju.
I know! He's behind all this

710
01:23:30,984 --> 01:23:36,145
You want to kill this innocent boy
over such a small thing?

711
01:23:36,146 --> 01:23:40,891
Get this straight. Raju is
like my grandson

712
01:23:41,931 --> 01:23:44,927
If Raju and Sonia are
in love with each other...

713
01:23:44,928 --> 01:23:48,341
no power on earth can
set them apart

714
01:23:48,342 --> 01:23:51,503
"Not you, not even your daddy"

715
01:23:51,504 --> 01:23:54,626
"Grandpa, they're hiding
Sonia somewhere"

716
01:23:54,918 --> 01:23:57,956
It's been a week.
Will you ask him where

717
01:23:57,957 --> 01:23:59,954
Where is she?

718
01:23:59,955 --> 01:24:01,536
Where...?

719
01:24:05,490 --> 01:24:07,946
"If you won't talk,
I'll slap you"

720
01:24:07,947 --> 01:24:13,691
Ceasar's. The shopping mall

721
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:28,135
"Sonia, who are you talking to?
- None of your concern"

722
01:24:29,967 --> 01:24:33,879
Let go of that arm. Not even a call!
And now you come romancing me?

723
01:24:35,254 --> 01:24:40,914
"Look, I'm here or a purpose.
- Look me up after the purpose"

724
01:24:41,621 --> 01:24:47,074
What's the matter with you?

725
01:24:58,106 --> 01:25:04,515
"I hope you aren't hurt...?
- Oh no, not at all"

726
01:25:04,890 --> 01:25:08,179
Just a small internal injury.
That touch healed it all

727
01:25:08,928 --> 01:25:13,881
You're rather handsome.
- Not even my mother said that to me

728
01:25:14,256 --> 01:25:15,920
"Shera...
- Go on, pal"

729
01:25:15,921 --> 01:25:19,875
What is this...?
- One minute. Excuse me...

730
01:25:20,209 --> 01:25:24,328
get over with your shopping.
Come along

731
01:25:24,329 --> 01:25:25,535
Shera...

732
01:25:25,744 --> 01:25:28,406
You're in town?
- Yes. And you...?

733
01:25:28,407 --> 01:25:31,863
I'm in town too.
- How come we never met before?

734
01:25:32,279 --> 01:25:35,859
"Strange, no...?
- One minute, Shera"

735
01:25:36,691 --> 01:25:41,188
"Tell me whatever, tomorrow.
Just now I'm busy"

736
01:25:47,889 --> 01:25:51,509
Who's he? He's disturbing us.
- Never mind him

737
01:25:51,718 --> 01:25:55,631
Let me have your telephone number.
- Why number? You can have my card

738
01:25:56,214 --> 01:26:00,501
It's my private number.
Call me whenever you want

739
01:26:01,333 --> 01:26:06,328
See you.
- Sure. I'll talk to you on phone

740
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:14,444
"She fell for you?
- Well, naturally"

741
01:26:14,445 --> 01:26:17,524
She's Sonia and we're in love
and she's angry...

742
01:26:17,525 --> 01:26:19,939
because I haven't telephoned her for
sometime. She gave you her number...

743
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:23,187
because she wants me to get jealous.
- Goodness! How sinful!

744
01:26:23,394 --> 01:26:28,681
Why didn't you tell me before?
- If only you gave me the chance

745
01:26:29,346 --> 01:26:31,927
"Go on, get lost"

746
01:26:31,928 --> 01:26:36,923
"Hey, are you really in love,
or are you trying to outdo me?"

747
01:26:37,964 --> 01:26:42,292
"I swear by my mother.
- Go on, get lost"

748
01:27:04,937 --> 01:27:06,309
Magic

749
01:27:23,626 --> 01:27:26,540
My love...

750
01:27:27,039 --> 01:27:31,868
"your bewitching eyes have
robbed my heart of peace"

751
01:27:35,322 --> 01:27:38,861
"Now say yes, my love"

752
01:28:46,793 --> 01:28:52,828
"Did I know
I'd fall in love?"

753
01:28:53,869 --> 01:28:57,282
"Did I ever know
how I'd pine for you?"

754
01:29:01,153 --> 01:29:07,355
"Your bewitching eyes
like daggers..."

755
01:29:08,063 --> 01:29:13,849
"and your beauty,
I've lost my heart to"

756
01:29:16,430 --> 01:29:22,840
"Now say yes, my love"

757
01:29:53,685 --> 01:29:54,600
Magic

758
01:30:25,528 --> 01:30:31,313
"Darling, I forgive you"

759
01:30:32,312 --> 01:30:38,556
"You've cast such a spell on me
my heart is enthralled"

760
01:31:01,283 --> 01:31:04,946
I'm so enthralled...

761
01:31:04,947 --> 01:31:10,358
"I'll wake sleepless nights
enraptured in memories of you"

762
01:31:13,438 --> 01:31:16,893
"Come to me, my love"

763
01:31:21,055 --> 01:31:24,052
My love...

764
01:31:27,965 --> 01:31:33,335
"Your bewitching eyes have
robbed my heart of peace"

765
01:31:36,498 --> 01:31:40,244
"Come to me, my love"

766
01:31:44,615 --> 01:31:48,861
Magic... this is the magic

767
01:31:58,018 --> 01:32:02,013
What are you up to? Reading my face?
Or breaking my face?

768
01:32:02,014 --> 01:32:04,927
I'll tell you 3 points about yourself.
- Go on

769
01:32:04,928 --> 01:32:10,672
"First, your money is what you earned.
- You thought I stole it?"

770
01:32:10,963 --> 01:32:15,958
"No, I mean, you didn't inherit.
You made it by dint of your efforts"

771
01:32:16,292 --> 01:32:18,996
Everyone knows that.
Say something new

772
01:32:18,997 --> 01:32:22,410
"Raju, read his face.
- This is preposterous!"

773
01:32:22,993 --> 01:32:24,990
Give me a chance

774
01:32:24,991 --> 01:32:27,987
Out of the geography of your face
I'll decipher your past

775
01:32:27,988 --> 01:32:31,693
And present and future. In a second.
- Everyone knows about my past

776
01:32:32,025 --> 01:32:35,979
I'm confident about the present.
I'll face tomorrow when it comes

777
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:40,892
"Grandpa, he's afraid. What is he hiding?
- Nothing at all"

778
01:32:41,267 --> 01:32:43,930
"At heart, my son is clean.
- Sure?"

779
01:32:43,930 --> 01:32:47,844
"Raju, read his face.
- Come off it"

780
01:32:48,384 --> 01:32:51,131
Give me once chance

781
01:32:51,132 --> 01:32:56,043
Daddy! What would he know?
- Grandpa! You sired a rare son

782
01:32:56,959 --> 01:33:01,871
"He's unique! The business will scale
heights, riches will lie at his feet"

783
01:33:03,286 --> 01:33:07,657
And he is destined to have 3 children.
One daughter and two sons

784
01:33:09,946 --> 01:33:14,858
I wish I had another grandson to manage
the business. Your son is hopeless

785
01:33:21,102 --> 01:33:23,973
"Grandpa, there's something
I'd like to tell him in private"

786
01:33:23,974 --> 01:33:27,345
In private? Why?
- Such is the matter

787
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:29,967
I'm his wife! We have no secrets.

788
01:33:29,968 --> 01:33:33,713
And I'm his father. No secrets
Tell us everything

789
01:33:33,714 --> 01:33:38,583
"A secretive man will even keep things
from himself, no?"

790
01:33:38,584 --> 01:33:41,831
"I told you, out with it.
- If you insist, I'll tell you"

791
01:33:49,864 --> 01:33:55,151
Have courage

792
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:58,355
In his lifetime...

793
01:33:58,356 --> 01:34:01,227
he has had
the love of two women

794
01:34:01,228 --> 01:34:04,558
What's this I hear?
- Nonsense! You trust him?

795
01:34:05,058 --> 01:34:08,386
"Next, he will say that he is my son!
Will you trust him?"

796
01:34:08,387 --> 01:34:12,299
I warned you! He knows nothing!
- He took it otherwise

797
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:14,922
I only said what was written
on his face

798
01:34:14,923 --> 01:34:18,128
"I'm sorry,
but the face never lies"

799
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:27,285
You believe whatever that moron says?
- Didn't Mrs. Walia trust her husband?

800
01:34:27,951 --> 01:34:34,320
And what happened to her? Be true to me
are you in love with another woman?

801
01:34:34,861 --> 01:34:39,148
Do I tear my heart out to show you?
- No

802
01:34:39,981 --> 01:34:43,186
Just swear it on your children
and rid me of this suspicion

803
01:34:44,893 --> 01:34:51,470
"Look Smita, I can ever swear falsely.
- What did you say...? Swear falsely?"

804
01:34:51,927 --> 01:34:52,594
Yes

805
01:34:53,301 --> 01:34:57,838
Stop... wait... I was just citing
an example. One who is deceitful...

806
01:34:58,129 --> 01:35:02,500
might even swear falsely.
- He'd swear fearlessly too

807
01:35:03,499 --> 01:35:07,162
"Were it not for your father and
the kids, I would've left this house"

808
01:35:07,953 --> 01:35:11,283
"But as of now, I'm leaving this room.
- Oh no... Smita..."

809
01:35:17,736 --> 01:35:22,647
"Separate rooms... to separate houses to
moving out of town, out of this country"

810
01:35:23,062 --> 01:35:26,351
So what if your wife is gone?
Your big son stands beside you

811
01:35:26,685 --> 01:35:31,845
Do you know any lullabies?

812
01:35:38,964 --> 01:35:46,081
You are the devil!
You are wrecking my home

813
01:35:49,078 --> 01:35:52,617
Hey! Did I kill you?
- I loved that one

814
01:35:52,908 --> 01:35:57,404
Will you sing that one for me?
- Why are you after my life?

815
01:36:12,347 --> 01:36:16,385
"You...? What are you doing here?
- A job, sir"

816
01:36:16,842 --> 01:36:20,088
Are you raving?
- I'm your personal assistant

817
01:36:20,089 --> 01:36:21,836
Are you drunk?
- No

818
01:36:21,837 --> 01:36:24,584
I won't hire you for an errand boy!
- I know

819
01:36:24,585 --> 01:36:26,997
You'd never make an errand boy
out of your son

820
01:36:26,998 --> 01:36:30,119
How did he get here...?
And what are you doing here?

821
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:33,408
I appointed him

822
01:36:33,409 --> 01:36:37,863
He's like you. You'll be comfortable
with him. He even walks like you

823
01:36:38,112 --> 01:36:39,943
I'll end up a cripple.
- Me too

824
01:36:39,944 --> 01:36:42,024
He even talks like you.
- I'll start stuttering

825
01:36:42,025 --> 01:36:44,189
Me too.
- He even worships the same god as you

826
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:46,977
I'll change my gods!
- Me too

827
01:36:46,978 --> 01:36:50,099
His habits are the same too.
Carbon copy. Exactly

828
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:52,888
But naturally! He's my copy.
- What...?

829
01:36:52,889 --> 01:36:56,010
"Forget it! I mean, he emulates me."

830
01:36:56,011 --> 01:37:00,507
My word! He's very nice. Hire him

831
01:37:00,798 --> 01:37:04,918
"All right, I will.
Get going now"

832
01:37:04,919 --> 01:37:08,914
Is that phone ringing?

833
01:37:08,915 --> 01:37:10,912
She has just left

834
01:37:10,913 --> 01:37:15,699
I'm Mr. Mittal's son.
- None of that

835
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:21,818
Dead. Just like your heart.
- What do you want from me?

836
01:37:22,527 --> 01:37:25,356
"It was here, in this room
that I told you..."

837
01:37:25,357 --> 01:37:28,811
I'd shake your family to it's
very foundations. Now I've done it

838
01:37:29,935 --> 01:37:33,308
You are mistaken. In this office
you are an employee

839
01:37:33,931 --> 01:37:37,844
Your place is over there. Get to work.
- You are mistaken

840
01:37:38,344 --> 01:37:42,173
My place is over there.

841
01:37:42,174 --> 01:37:47,875
As long as I'm alive that
place is mine

842
01:37:47,876 --> 01:37:52,911
"But I will never let
anything befall you, Dad"

843
01:37:52,912 --> 01:37:56,075
What a rogue

844
01:37:56,076 --> 01:37:59,157
God! So grave a punishment
for such a small mistake?

845
01:37:59,698 --> 01:38:04,110
"This is injustice! Have mercy!
Else, I'll be left in tears"

846
01:38:12,934 --> 01:38:16,557
Daddy is responsible for all this.
He extended Raju's visa

847
01:38:16,972 --> 01:38:20,553
"The visa is expiring. The ministry
has faxed us, asking for fees..."

848
01:38:20,926 --> 01:38:24,672
for extending the visa.
- What a godsend!

849
01:38:24,922 --> 01:38:28,252
I hope you haven't shown it to anyone?
- This fax? No

850
01:38:28,253 --> 01:38:31,374
"Tear it up, throw it away.
The fee won't be paid"

851
01:38:31,375 --> 01:38:33,996
He will become an illegal immigrant.
I will call the police

852
01:38:33,997 --> 01:38:38,201
They will deport him
back to India

853
01:38:39,949 --> 01:38:41,697
Tear it up

854
01:39:04,092 --> 01:39:07,130
The prayer is nearly over
and no sign of the police yet

855
01:39:32,854 --> 01:39:36,517
Your visa has expired. We have orders
to deport you right away

856
01:39:36,934 --> 01:39:41,388
But Daddy extended his visa.
- The extension period is over

857
01:39:42,012 --> 01:39:45,883
You should've sent prior intimation.
- We faxed your offices

858
01:39:46,217 --> 01:39:50,669
But your office hasn't replied yet.
- What? You faxed my office?

859
01:39:51,045 --> 01:39:55,207
And I know nothing?
How can this be?

860
01:39:55,208 --> 01:40:00,203
Who wouldn't want Raju
to be with me?

861
01:40:00,618 --> 01:40:05,654
"After all, he's just like my son.
Raju my boy, you're leaving London..."

862
01:40:06,030 --> 01:40:11,565
I'll miss you dearly!
I'll weep for you

863
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:17,060
But there must be a way out.
- No way

864
01:40:17,311 --> 01:40:19,057
There's one way.
- What way?

865
01:40:19,058 --> 01:40:20,556
That

866
01:40:29,007 --> 01:40:34,001
What can she do?
- She loves me and I love her

867
01:40:34,002 --> 01:40:35,416
British passport?
- Yes

868
01:40:35,417 --> 01:40:40,787
Now I don't need any visa.
I'm getting a passport. British

869
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:46,614
He's raving

870
01:41:22,953 --> 01:41:27,241
"After the seven vows, we're taking
an eighth. For my British passport"

871
01:41:28,031 --> 01:41:29,570
Bless us

872
01:41:39,311 --> 01:41:44,015
"According to U.K. Laws,
he cannot be deported"

873
01:41:52,923 --> 01:41:57,293
Robin! The police came! By now
he would've been in India

874
01:41:57,918 --> 01:42:01,664
"Then your daughter married
that rascal, made him a citizen"

875
01:42:01,914 --> 01:42:05,203
Mr. Mittal! Don't you dare
call my son-in-law names

876
01:42:05,493 --> 01:42:09,199
"Son-in-law...?
- Yes, I love my daughter dearly"

877
01:42:09,614 --> 01:42:12,735
I approve of the man whom
my daughter loves

878
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:16,649
Don't you dare malign Raju.
- What are you saying?

879
01:42:17,273 --> 01:42:23,559
My only friend! Has that scoundrel
weaned you away from me too?

880
01:42:25,265 --> 01:42:30,261
I'll even take you to court

881
01:42:30,384 --> 01:42:36,213
How about a cup of tea?
- Cut out the sugar

882
01:43:06,932 --> 01:43:10,927
My bangles chime...

883
01:43:10,928 --> 01:43:14,175
do you like it?

884
01:43:18,962 --> 01:43:23,207
The colour of henna on me...

885
01:43:23,623 --> 01:43:26,871
do you like it?

886
01:43:27,995 --> 01:43:35,862
"I love the colour of your bangles,
the henna stain shows your love for me"

887
01:43:36,402 --> 01:43:44,269
"You're one-in-a-million
this is like a dream come true"

888
01:44:55,531 --> 01:44:59,652
"Come to me, my love..."

889
01:44:59,653 --> 01:45:02,858
I'm eager

890
01:45:04,231 --> 01:45:07,645
I'm pining for you...

891
01:45:08,268 --> 01:45:11,849
"I'm waiting for you, my love"

892
01:45:12,348 --> 01:45:15,845
"Tonight, I'll make love to you..."

893
01:45:16,385 --> 01:45:19,841
I'll cross every limit

894
01:45:24,919 --> 01:45:28,582
The colour of vermilion on me...

895
01:45:29,289 --> 01:45:32,661
do you like it?

896
01:45:33,368 --> 01:45:37,239
The colour of henna on me...

897
01:45:37,656 --> 01:45:40,861
do you like it?

898
01:45:41,902 --> 01:45:47,771
"I love the colour of your vermilion,
the henna stain shows your love for me"

899
01:45:49,977 --> 01:45:56,137
"You're one-in-a-million
this is like a dream come true"

900
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:35,848
"Your seduction,
and my Loneliness..."

901
01:46:37,471 --> 01:46:44,214
"bring us closer,
distances are no more"

902
01:46:45,213 --> 01:46:49,126
Your destiny is mine

903
01:46:49,584 --> 01:46:53,830
Your dreams are mine

904
01:46:54,287 --> 01:46:57,826
Come to me

905
01:46:58,450 --> 01:47:02,196
The colour of my veil...

906
01:47:02,571 --> 01:47:05,859
do you like it?

907
01:47:06,942 --> 01:47:10,271
The colour of henna on me...

908
01:47:10,938 --> 01:47:14,850
do you like it?

909
01:47:15,724 --> 01:47:23,425
"I love the colour of your veil,
the henna stain shows your love for me"

910
01:47:23,841 --> 01:47:29,669
"You're one-in-a-million
this is like a dream come true"

911
01:47:59,223 --> 01:48:02,885
Where is he?

912
01:48:02,886 --> 01:48:08,296
Where are you?

913
01:48:08,297 --> 01:48:10,919
Fresh stuff

914
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:12,542
Lucky dog

915
01:48:13,042 --> 01:48:16,038
Pull him up

916
01:48:16,039 --> 01:48:16,914
Well...?

917
01:48:18,912 --> 01:48:20,659
Get up

918
01:48:21,617 --> 01:48:26,279
"Are you frittering away
my money, gambling?"

919
01:48:26,945 --> 01:48:30,940
When will you return my money?

920
01:48:30,941 --> 01:48:36,685
Why are you beating a gentleman?
- The scoundrel won't take my calls

921
01:48:37,059 --> 01:48:42,388
"Oh, but that's true.
Why don't you take calls?"

922
01:48:42,846 --> 01:48:46,592
You think I'll give up my money
if you won't take my calls?

923
01:48:48,090 --> 01:48:51,254
Get up. Will I give up my money?
- Sock him hard

924
01:48:56,124 --> 01:49:00,619
Enough. I'll pay you back.
- And how?

925
01:49:00,994 --> 01:49:04,241
"If he says he will pay you, he will.
- But how?"

926
01:49:04,574 --> 01:49:08,611
"True, he's up to his hair in debt.
- That's why I tell you, kill him"

927
01:49:08,903 --> 01:49:12,816
End of tensions.
- Put that gun away

928
01:49:13,232 --> 01:49:16,812
Ever heard of R.K. Mittal?
I'm marrying his daughter

929
01:49:20,599 --> 01:49:24,470
R.K. Mittal is giving you his daughter?
I think ten times before lending to you

930
01:49:24,928 --> 01:49:28,633
"You don't believe? Come, take a look.
- Shall we?"

931
01:49:28,966 --> 01:49:33,545
Sure.
- But... this is your last chance

932
01:49:43,035 --> 01:49:47,864
Vikram I never met your uncle.
- He lives in South Africa

933
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:52,401
"Mr. Mittal, by God's grace
my business is doing very well"

934
01:49:53,275 --> 01:49:56,855
I'd like Vikram to move in with me.
He has no family here

935
01:49:57,396 --> 01:50:00,559
But we're here.
- Not like a son-in-law

936
01:50:01,017 --> 01:50:05,387
Take him for a son.
- He is like a son to me

937
01:50:05,388 --> 01:50:10,092
"Mr. Mittal, now that I'm here,
I'd like to see Vikram married"

938
01:50:10,508 --> 01:50:13,587
How long will you be here.
- Abut a fortnight

939
01:50:13,588 --> 01:50:17,043
But that's too short a notice.
- Sooner or later...

940
01:50:17,376 --> 01:50:20,580
we got to see him married off.
So why not now?

941
01:50:20,581 --> 01:50:23,911
"Not before another four or five years,
I think. Rinke is till a child"

942
01:50:24,535 --> 01:50:28,906
"If the wedding is final,
later won't hurt, will it?"

943
01:50:30,987 --> 01:50:34,608
Who is he?
- He is employed in this house

944
01:50:34,609 --> 01:50:37,189
So it's my duty to consider the best
of the interests for the household

945
01:50:37,190 --> 01:50:38,978
"Quiet, Raju"

946
01:50:38,979 --> 01:50:42,225
How can we organize a wedding
at such short notice?

947
01:50:42,226 --> 01:50:45,930
"Mr. Mittal, half of England
dances to your whim"

948
01:50:45,931 --> 01:50:49,426
"At two days' notice, you can give
your daughter a grand send-off"

949
01:50:49,427 --> 01:50:54,880
Maybe. But we have certain plans.
She is our only daughter

950
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:59,916
If the wedding happened
while my uncle is here...

951
01:50:59,917 --> 01:51:03,370
someone from my father's side
may bless the union

952
01:51:03,371 --> 01:51:08,325
Let's think this over.
We'll let you know in a day or two

953
01:51:14,985 --> 01:51:18,356
Bless you. I have a long-standing
relationship...

954
01:51:18,690 --> 01:51:21,977
with the business group you're
approaching. Give them my regards

955
01:51:21,978 --> 01:51:25,641
Mittal and Sons have a standing
all over Europe. Take care

956
01:51:26,390 --> 01:51:29,554
Sorry to be late.
- Where are you going?

957
01:51:29,970 --> 01:51:32,800
He's leaving.
- He is leaving...?

958
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:35,547
Are you really leaving?
- Yes

959
01:51:35,548 --> 01:51:40,251
I'll drop you to the airport.
- He's accompanying you

960
01:51:41,001 --> 01:51:46,371
Accompanying me...?

961
01:51:47,119 --> 01:51:49,949
You aren't well.
He's going to take care of you

962
01:51:49,950 --> 01:51:53,029
He makes it worse for me!
- What a thing to say...!

963
01:51:53,030 --> 01:51:57,191
"Take care of him, son.
- Grandpa, have nothing to worry"

964
01:51:57,192 --> 01:51:59,981
You will find a remarkable change
by the time he returns

965
01:51:59,982 --> 01:52:04,809
I'll take good care of him.
- Wonderful

966
01:52:09,014 --> 01:52:15,091
We are the only industrialists
marketing Indian cars worldwide

967
01:52:16,632 --> 01:52:20,211
We gave the European agencies
to Purushottam Mittal...

968
01:52:20,628 --> 01:52:23,124
only because he's an Indian

969
01:52:23,125 --> 01:52:28,911
"In the beginning, sales peaked"

970
01:52:29,619 --> 01:52:33,281
We have decided to revoke the agency.
- What are you saying?

971
01:52:33,948 --> 01:52:38,485
Purushottam Mittal started out
with our agency

972
01:52:38,984 --> 01:52:43,480
"Now that you have grown, you haven't
got the time for servicing us"

973
01:52:44,937 --> 01:52:48,432
This agency isn't about money

974
01:52:48,433 --> 01:52:54,885
"Recently, I received
the businessman of the year award"

975
01:52:54,968 --> 01:52:57,922
No business associate has never
severed ties with us

976
01:52:57,923 --> 01:53:01,419
"As you know, our showrooms are located
in prime spots"

977
01:53:01,420 --> 01:53:05,250
Our sales department is very efficient.
- Yet sales have plummeted

978
01:53:05,749 --> 01:53:08,287
"Somewhere, something is going wrong"

979
01:53:08,288 --> 01:53:13,575
"Sure, something is wrong.
But we aren't to blame"

980
01:53:14,032 --> 01:53:18,236
"If there's something wrong,
it's there in your cars"

981
01:53:18,237 --> 01:53:21,567
The cars you use are of another make.
The day you use your cars...

982
01:53:21,941 --> 01:53:24,978
you will shut shop.
- What are you saying?

983
01:53:24,979 --> 01:53:29,683
I'm telling him facts.
In the 21 st century...

984
01:53:29,974 --> 01:53:33,138
you're selling cars from the time
when Hitler went to school

985
01:53:33,430 --> 01:53:36,510
What are you saying? Sit down.
- Let him speak

986
01:53:37,966 --> 01:53:43,003
"Fuel efficiency in your cars is zero.
Looks zero, comfort zero, drive zero"

987
01:53:43,420 --> 01:53:47,040
Whatever you're selling is thanks
to the reputation of the Mittals

988
01:53:47,041 --> 01:53:50,870
"Else, your sales would've been zero.
Your car is a bullock cart"

989
01:53:53,368 --> 01:53:58,779
This is a car. Look

990
01:54:11,932 --> 01:54:16,926
Come with me

991
01:54:16,927 --> 01:54:22,214
He has ruined me!
What a scoundrel

992
01:54:23,005 --> 01:54:26,750
"For the first time,
I am aware of my weaknesses"

993
01:54:26,751 --> 01:54:29,955
You spoke the truth
without hesitating

994
01:54:29,956 --> 01:54:34,327
Our company needs honest employees
like you

995
01:54:34,993 --> 01:54:38,905
Come over to us.
I'll pay you the asking price

996
01:54:40,029 --> 01:54:46,814
"Forgive me, sir. Not for money,
not for anything, can I ever leave him"

997
01:54:48,770 --> 01:54:51,976
But I have a request. Please let him
keep the agency

998
01:54:58,802 --> 01:55:02,840
Very well. Mittal keeps the agency

999
01:55:03,714 --> 01:55:09,750
"Only because, he has you"

1000
01:55:18,283 --> 01:55:21,446
Why do you go about everything
so surreptitiously?

1001
01:55:21,447 --> 01:55:24,859
Eavesdropping?
Even loving surreptitiously?

1002
01:55:28,939 --> 01:55:34,309
Not even for all the world's wealth
will I ever desert you

1003
01:55:52,915 --> 01:55:58,410
"Enough, sir. What are you doing?
- I'm drinking because I'm elated"

1004
01:56:00,573 --> 01:56:06,027
You've won my heart! Ask and
I'll give you anything you wish

1005
01:56:07,235 --> 01:56:11,147
"But what can you ask for?
Come on, come with me"

1006
01:56:12,313 --> 01:56:17,182
One second...

1007
01:56:17,932 --> 01:56:22,010
Listen... look at me

1008
01:56:22,011 --> 01:56:28,005
This is my long-lost son!
And I am his father

1009
01:56:28,422 --> 01:56:32,916
I am... his father

1010
01:56:32,917 --> 01:56:39,826
I was unjust towards him
and his mother. I hurt them

1011
01:56:41,326 --> 01:56:48,817
"But I was helpless. Because...
- Sir, they're whites. Use English"

1012
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:14,168
"Watch it, Dad.
- Do you think I'm drunk?"

1013
01:57:14,916 --> 01:57:17,996
Listen to this song

1014
01:57:17,997 --> 01:57:25,365
"I've become a riddle and I'm afraid
I don't know how to solve this riddle"

1015
01:57:25,989 --> 01:57:33,564
"It moves me to tears now that I see
you in the bloom of your youth"

1016
01:57:34,646 --> 01:57:37,852
"I remember everything,
I haven't forgotten anything"

1017
01:57:38,352 --> 01:57:41,806
"I was helpless, I'm not evil"

1018
01:57:42,888 --> 01:57:46,302
"Forgive me, you are my son"

1019
01:57:46,801 --> 01:57:49,923
"Embrace me, for you are
only my shadow"

1020
01:57:50,422 --> 01:57:55,043
"No fax, no Xerox, no telex,
no floppies"

1021
01:57:58,956 --> 01:58:02,203
"You're just your Papa's
carbon copy"

1022
01:58:04,908 --> 01:58:06,697
Carbon copy

1023
01:58:06,698 --> 01:58:13,816
"No fax, no Xerox, no telex,
no floppies"

1024
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:19,269
"I'm just my Papa's
carbon copy"

1025
01:58:21,308 --> 01:58:26,179
Carbon copy

1026
01:58:38,333 --> 01:58:41,578
Bring in the tea. Get up

1027
01:58:41,579 --> 01:58:44,785
"Come on, let's have tea,
father and son"

1028
01:58:47,907 --> 01:58:51,778
What's this Dad-Dad up in the morning?
- Last night you said I'm your son

1029
01:58:52,902 --> 01:58:56,396
Are you raving?
When did I accept you as my son?

1030
01:58:56,397 --> 01:58:58,063
"Last night, at the bar"

1031
01:58:58,064 --> 01:59:01,102
My head...
- You screamed your head off

1032
01:59:06,888 --> 01:59:10,217
Were there any acquaintances nearby?
Did someone overhear me?

1033
01:59:10,218 --> 01:59:14,838
"Regrettably, only whites.
- Then forget last night's story"

1034
01:59:15,130 --> 01:59:20,541
Pack up. It's time for the flight

1035
01:59:20,916 --> 01:59:23,245
Isn't that what you said to my Ma?

1036
01:59:23,246 --> 01:59:26,826
Forget last night's story.
Then you packed and you flew

1037
01:59:36,941 --> 01:59:42,020
You lied to me about Dad being dead.
You knew I wouldn't be able to bear it

1038
01:59:43,268 --> 01:59:46,513
And why did you send me to him?
You knew what kind of man he is

1039
01:59:46,514 --> 01:59:51,593
Then why did you lie to me? Why?
- Are you raving?

1040
01:59:51,926 --> 01:59:56,421
I'm talking to my Ma.
Do you object?

1041
01:59:56,671 --> 02:00:01,208
"Last night's story! Last night in
a drunken stupor, you acknowledged me"

1042
02:00:02,415 --> 02:00:05,327
Did you marry my Ma
in a drunken stupor?

1043
02:00:05,328 --> 02:00:08,367
What do I remind you of?
Of one too many whiskies?

1044
02:00:09,242 --> 02:00:12,447
Do you think I'm after your money?

1045
02:00:12,989 --> 02:00:17,859
The joy of finding my Daddy alive
drove me mad. I thought...

1046
02:00:18,482 --> 02:00:20,980
my father would welcome me
with open arms...

1047
02:00:20,981 --> 02:00:25,017
I expected you'd tell everyone
that I'm your Meghna's son

1048
02:00:25,018 --> 02:00:28,597
And you think that
I'm after your wealth?

1049
02:00:29,014 --> 02:00:33,551
Who do you think this boy
in tattered jeans is?

1050
02:00:34,175 --> 02:00:38,171
"Your manservant, begging you
to acknowledge him as your son?"

1051
02:00:38,963 --> 02:00:42,875
Some poor Meghna Saxena's son
coming after your money?

1052
02:00:43,958 --> 02:00:50,534
"Say, with whom would Purushottam Mittal
like to do business in India?"

1053
02:00:51,324 --> 02:00:54,863
Raj Industries? And who's Raj?

1054
02:00:57,944 --> 02:01:02,647
The man who stands before you
owns Raj Industries

1055
02:01:04,436 --> 02:01:09,806
I am wealthy

1056
02:01:09,932 --> 02:01:13,635
I left everything behind
and I came here for you

1057
02:01:13,636 --> 02:01:17,923
Now I don't want your name.
You never did your duty

1058
02:01:19,380 --> 02:01:24,500
"But Mr. Mittal, I will surely do
my duty as a brother before I leave"

1059
02:01:28,954 --> 02:01:32,366
And afterwards...

1060
02:01:32,367 --> 02:01:36,821
I will never return

1061
02:01:48,101 --> 02:01:51,388
What's in that?
- Money my friend

1062
02:01:51,389 --> 02:01:56,176
"If you're marrying a Mittal,
you ought to have the spending power"

1063
02:01:56,926 --> 02:01:59,838
You bashed me up for so little money.
What might you do for so much?

1064
02:01:59,839 --> 02:02:03,669
"Past things, past.
Now I'm your uncle"

1065
02:02:04,627 --> 02:02:07,206
You forgot that relationship
while you were bashing me up?

1066
02:02:07,207 --> 02:02:11,285
It's all his fault.
Wasn't I always telling him not to?

1067
02:02:11,286 --> 02:02:14,824
"Now don't be angry.
Come on, bash me up"

1068
02:02:15,990 --> 02:02:20,402
What makes you so kind?
- Son-in-law to the Mittals

1069
02:02:20,860 --> 02:02:23,190
That's what you're about to become.
And it's a pan-Europe business

1070
02:02:23,191 --> 02:02:26,563
We'd like to run our illegitimate
businesses alongside yours

1071
02:02:26,854 --> 02:02:30,807
"Nice idea, no?
- Wonderful idea..."

1072
02:02:30,808 --> 02:02:36,303
blowing up your father-in-law's money
and your uncle's too. You got it made

1073
02:02:36,636 --> 02:02:38,966
What are you doing here?
- I haven't come alone

1074
02:02:38,967 --> 02:02:42,005
I brought your father-in-law
and your fiancé along

1075
02:02:42,006 --> 02:02:42,921
Mr. Mittal

1076
02:02:48,957 --> 02:02:52,579
Is he your son-in-law to-be?
Will you give him your daughter?

1077
02:02:55,992 --> 02:03:01,861
I'll give him a hand.
Not Rinke's. Mine

1078
02:03:06,106 --> 02:03:11,268
Scoundrel! You deceived us!
You cheated my daughter

1079
02:03:11,934 --> 02:03:15,305
He would've ruined your life. Now
your father is beating him. Good

1080
02:03:17,970 --> 02:03:21,674
I was about to give you my daughter!
And this is how you repay me?

1081
02:03:23,797 --> 02:03:26,377
Mr. Mittal...
- Shut up! What will you do?

1082
02:03:26,378 --> 02:03:32,788
I'll turn you over to the police

1083
02:03:50,062 --> 02:03:55,182
Get a doctor
- Get out of here

1084
02:04:00,927 --> 02:04:04,673
Rinke calling. She sounds nervous.
- Yes Rinke...?

1085
02:04:04,923 --> 02:04:07,003
Papa has been... shot.
- What happened to him...?

1086
02:04:07,004 --> 02:04:10,042
He's in I.C.U.
- What?! Grandfather!

1087
02:04:59,910 --> 02:05:04,904
By bringing Mr. Mittal to the hospital
I completed one phase of my duty

1088
02:05:04,905 --> 02:05:11,064
And I'll accomplish my second duty
by bashing you up

1089
02:06:05,010 --> 02:06:09,589
Both his kidneys have failed.
- So what are you waiting for?

1090
02:06:09,964 --> 02:06:13,627
Do something. Don't worry about money.
I'm willing to spend anything

1091
02:06:14,043 --> 02:06:19,413
This is not about money. A donor
is needed for a kidney transplant

1092
02:06:19,746 --> 02:06:26,240
"Doctor, take my kidney.
- I can't. You're an ageing diabetic"

1093
02:06:26,947 --> 02:06:34,148
"You can use mine, can't you?
- No, your blood group doesn't match his"

1094
02:06:34,523 --> 02:06:40,267
"Doctor, take my kidney.
- I'm his chief security officer"

1095
02:06:41,432 --> 02:06:44,805
"Going by the law, we can use
only a relative's kidney"

1096
02:06:45,221 --> 02:06:49,800
Are relationships only blood ties?
I take care of his house

1097
02:06:50,174 --> 02:06:53,586
It's my duty to protect his life too.

1098
02:06:53,587 --> 02:06:56,834
I appreciate your emotions
But I'm helpless

1099
02:07:00,913 --> 02:07:04,618
Our Bunty will give a kidney!
In times like this...

1100
02:07:04,909 --> 02:07:08,489
only a son can help.
- What? Parting with a kidney?

1101
02:07:08,905 --> 02:07:12,318
"To his sons, a father gives life.
You will be the only son..."

1102
02:07:12,568 --> 02:07:17,105
who will give life to his father.
- No Grandpa. I can't spare a kidney

1103
02:07:20,061 --> 02:07:23,015
I got to become a pop singer.
If I give a kidney away...

1104
02:07:23,016 --> 02:07:25,929
"how will I sing and dance on stage?
- Son, for your sake..."

1105
02:07:25,930 --> 02:07:29,009
"I'll finance a hundred albums,
I'll start a music company"

1106
02:07:29,010 --> 02:07:32,673
Give a kidney to your Daddy.
- You must be the first grandfather...

1107
02:07:32,923 --> 02:07:36,877
paying for a kidney with a music company.
- Bunty! What kind of a son are you?

1108
02:07:37,418 --> 02:07:43,037
Your Daddy's life holds
no value for you?

1109
02:07:43,038 --> 02:07:48,199
"Rinke, my daughter! She is the apple
of her father's eye and she loves him"

1110
02:07:48,865 --> 02:07:52,028
"she will give her kidney.
- Mummy, Bunty is his son"

1111
02:07:52,029 --> 02:07:55,941
And he refuses to part with a kidney.
I'm a girl. How can you ask this of me?

1112
02:07:58,897 --> 02:08:02,393
"I'll marry, I will have babies.
I've got a whole life ahead of me"

1113
02:08:02,893 --> 02:08:08,386
What if life without a kidney
becomes problematic?

1114
02:08:08,387 --> 02:08:13,840
"The man who gave you all his love,
the man who taught you how to walk..."

1115
02:08:14,214 --> 02:08:19,585
his life is all about seeing you happy.
- He isn't doing us a favour

1116
02:08:23,997 --> 02:08:28,159
"Rearing children, giving them
an education, is a parent's duty"

1117
02:08:28,950 --> 02:08:32,447
And the offspring? Does the child
have no duty towards the parent?

1118
02:08:33,070 --> 02:08:37,858
Now that I see the truth about you
I know what a great man my son is

1119
02:08:38,982 --> 02:08:46,516
All my life he obeyed me. Not for
a day did he do what he wished

1120
02:08:52,093 --> 02:08:56,297
"For the sake of my principles,
he sacrificed his happinesses"

1121
02:08:57,879 --> 02:09:03,790
How helpless I am!
I can do nothing for my son...?

1122
02:09:05,580 --> 02:09:09,493
I'm supposed to be the
richest man in London

1123
02:09:09,909 --> 02:09:13,489
"I tell you, I'm a pauper"

1124
02:09:13,780 --> 02:09:17,818
I can do nothing to help my son

1125
02:09:19,316 --> 02:09:25,767
I can do nothing for my son

1126
02:09:46,498 --> 02:09:52,241
"Life's all about
goings and comings..."

1127
02:09:52,242 --> 02:09:56,363
"a melody woven in
joys and sorrows"

1128
02:09:57,694 --> 02:10:01,857
I got to pay back my debt

1129
02:10:02,939 --> 02:10:07,185
"This duty, I must perform"

1130
02:10:08,392 --> 02:10:13,221
"Tomorrow, I may not be here"

1131
02:10:13,886 --> 02:10:18,299
And I won't trouble you

1132
02:10:19,381 --> 02:10:26,541
"You and I are tied together
in a bond of blood..."

1133
02:10:26,873 --> 02:10:33,367
that's unforgettable

1134
02:10:58,841 --> 02:11:02,129
I have informed all my relatives.
I have also telephoned India

1135
02:11:02,130 --> 02:11:04,419
"By tomorrow, someone or the other
will surely arrive"

1136
02:11:04,420 --> 02:11:07,832
Not necessary anymore.
- No doctor! Don't say that

1137
02:11:08,458 --> 02:11:12,619
Nothing can happen to my son!
- What's the matter with him?

1138
02:11:15,200 --> 02:11:20,486
We have transplanted a kidney

1139
02:11:20,487 --> 02:11:24,400
Transplanted already?
But who donated it?

1140
02:11:25,023 --> 02:11:29,893
"Didn't you say, it must be a relative?
- He is a relative"

1141
02:11:30,477 --> 02:11:36,388
And he has donated it
on condition of anonymity

1142
02:11:37,095 --> 02:11:40,426
I can tell you nothing about him

1143
02:11:44,296 --> 02:11:48,209
God! I thought I am the greatest
of philanthropists

1144
02:11:51,331 --> 02:11:56,866
And now someone shows me I'm nothing

1145
02:11:57,949 --> 02:12:00,945
He's more charitable than I am

1146
02:12:00,946 --> 02:12:05,857
May God make him happy

1147
02:12:07,190 --> 02:12:13,350
"Hey Bunty, Rinke! Come in"

1148
02:12:14,100 --> 02:12:19,677
"Daddy, you always said he's a bad coin,
didn't you? In this hour of need..."

1149
02:12:19,969 --> 02:12:22,508
it's the bad coin that has
proved useful

1150
02:12:22,509 --> 02:12:26,213
"The doctor told me, it's a relative
who has donated the kidney"

1151
02:12:32,290 --> 02:12:34,953
I thought...

1152
02:12:34,954 --> 02:12:36,535
I see...

1153
02:12:37,077 --> 02:12:42,405
thank you Rinke.
Rinke has saved her Papa's life

1154
02:12:42,904 --> 02:12:48,358
"No son. Neither Rinke,
nor Bunty, nor l"

1155
02:12:48,940 --> 02:12:50,603
Then who...?

1156
02:12:50,604 --> 02:12:55,849
"I don't know, who or wherefrom.
He has remained anonymous"

1157
02:12:56,932 --> 02:13:01,676
"He presented the doctor with
the proof, he gave you life..."

1158
02:13:02,260 --> 02:13:07,713
then he simply left

1159
02:13:51,044 --> 02:13:55,082
"How are you, Buta Singh?"

1160
02:13:58,953 --> 02:14:02,324
What's this son?

1161
02:14:02,325 --> 02:14:05,446
"Raju, where are you going?"

1162
02:14:06,321 --> 02:14:09,567
Back to India.
- India...?

1163
02:14:10,276 --> 02:14:13,979
But you came because
you wanted to become like him?

1164
02:14:13,980 --> 02:14:18,268
Are you leaving already?
- Because I have realized...

1165
02:14:18,933 --> 02:14:23,845
no one can be like him.
- And you will leave me?

1166
02:14:29,964 --> 02:14:33,710
Look into my eyes and tell me
...are you leaving me?

1167
02:14:36,456 --> 02:14:39,870
But how can you say?
I'm going to tell them

1168
02:14:41,785 --> 02:14:46,571
"Daddy, you don't know who Raju is"

1169
02:14:47,072 --> 02:14:50,567
"Sir, please... say nothing"

1170
02:14:51,110 --> 02:14:57,560
"You are recuperating, you need rest.
- No Raju, if not today..."

1171
02:14:57,936 --> 02:15:03,264
"I will never be able to say this.
Daddy, Smita..."

1172
02:15:05,928 --> 02:15:09,632
Raju is my son

1173
02:15:11,256 --> 02:15:13,046
Son...?

1174
02:15:21,912 --> 02:15:25,116
"So, you are grandpa.
This is my mother"

1175
02:15:25,117 --> 02:15:30,653
And these are my brothers and sisters?
Why are you fibbing them?

1176
02:15:31,028 --> 02:15:34,689
Am I lying?
- Or am I lying?

1177
02:15:34,690 --> 02:15:38,188
You wanted to know who saved my life?

1178
02:15:38,978 --> 02:15:42,141
"Daddy, he's your blood! My son"

1179
02:15:42,142 --> 02:15:46,637
See for yourselves!
Operation stitches

1180
02:15:48,384 --> 02:15:52,964
So I donated my kidney. You're lucky
our blood groups matched

1181
02:15:54,047 --> 02:15:57,501
And I owe you too.
So what's so great about it?

1182
02:15:58,625 --> 02:16:01,830
"All along, you nagged be because
you wanted me to say you're my son"

1183
02:16:02,329 --> 02:16:06,325
Now that I'm saying it...
- Why should I call you my father?

1184
02:16:06,700 --> 02:16:09,822
You aren't my Daddy.
- No son! Call me Daddy. Say it

1185
02:16:11,196 --> 02:16:17,314
Why should I...?
- Because I'm telling you. Say it

1186
02:16:18,396 --> 02:16:21,643
If I have struck you
I'm using my rights as a father

1187
02:16:24,932 --> 02:16:29,178
I implore you.
I'm pleading with you

1188
02:16:29,594 --> 02:16:35,796
"I'm begging of you... tell them.
- What are you doing, Daddy?"

1189
02:16:36,962 --> 02:16:41,623
"Well done, son"

1190
02:16:45,995 --> 02:16:49,241
So father and son have been keeping
such a big secret from us?

1191
02:16:51,156 --> 02:16:56,774
My grandson lived with me
and I never had an inkling?

1192
02:16:56,775 --> 02:16:59,479
Had we not arrived
in the nick of time...

1193
02:16:59,480 --> 02:17:03,809
we would never have known
of his sacrifice

1194
02:17:03,810 --> 02:17:09,721
"Come on son, how am I to blame?
Why do you want to leave me?"

1195
02:17:12,218 --> 02:17:15,922
No one is to blame.
I am the only one to blame

1196
02:17:15,923 --> 02:17:20,501
"I came, wanting
to wreck this family..."

1197
02:17:21,625 --> 02:17:26,370
seeking revenge against the man
who ruined my mother

1198
02:17:29,034 --> 02:17:32,531
"Then I came in to live with you,
and I wondered..."

1199
02:17:32,948 --> 02:17:36,527
whose home am I about to wreck?
A home for my father?

1200
02:17:36,944 --> 02:17:42,895
"A home for my siblings,
my grandfather's home"

1201
02:17:42,896 --> 02:17:47,391
I'm unfit to stay here.
So I want to leave

1202
02:17:55,966 --> 02:17:59,088
"Raju, I'm not letting you leave"

1203
02:18:00,253 --> 02:18:05,623
How can I tear father from son?

1204
02:18:07,912 --> 02:18:13,823
"I never even knew I have another son.
And today, I've just found him"

1205
02:18:14,280 --> 02:18:19,859
"Raju, seek from you
my rights as a sister"

1206
02:18:23,896 --> 02:18:27,684
"Stay on, you got to manage all this.
I got to become a pop singer"

1207
02:18:28,059 --> 02:18:29,265
Shut up

1208
02:18:30,098 --> 02:18:33,845
Everyone else is talking!
And who am I...?

1209
02:18:36,925 --> 02:18:42,461
"You want to go away?
Go on, get out right now"

1210
02:18:44,043 --> 02:18:48,246
"But remember, in the grandson,
the grandfather is reincarnated"

1211
02:18:49,870 --> 02:18:54,282
"If you leave me, I won't live.
I'm going to die"

1212
02:18:57,862 --> 02:19:00,900
It's going to kill me!
I'm not letting you go away

1213
02:19:00,901 --> 02:19:04,522
"What are you saying, Grandpa?
- I'm not letting you leave"

1214
02:19:04,980 --> 02:19:09,891
I'm not leaving.
- You won't...?

1215
02:19:09,892 --> 02:19:14,304
Family reunion! Are we being left out?
What's going to become of my daughter?

1216
02:19:14,679 --> 02:19:18,799
Where are we to go?
- Go wherever you want to go

1217
02:19:19,215 --> 02:19:22,463
Make sure you send your daughter.
She's the bride of my house

1218
02:19:22,920 --> 02:19:24,627
I'm here

1219
02:19:25,002 --> 02:19:30,955
Ask for Grandpa's blessings.
- Bless you

1220
02:19:37,947 --> 02:19:40,943
"So at last, you acknowledge me?"

1221
02:19:40,944 --> 02:19:44,732
What a scoundrel
