1
00:01:28,436 --> 00:01:29,596
Why does it have to stop now?

2
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,919
Unless it has to raise my fears.

3
00:01:43,606 --> 00:01:47,977
Even these scary
sounds are heard at the right time.

4
00:02:03,704 --> 00:02:05,511
Lift... Lift Please.

5
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,763
Thank you very much.

6
00:02:13,238 --> 00:02:14,318
You came at the right time.

7
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,356
Otherwise,
I would have become news tomorrow morning.

8
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:20,137
By the way, where are you coming from?

9
00:02:21,868 --> 00:02:24,935
I am only asking for
the sake of conversation.

10
00:02:25,202 --> 00:02:27,044
Tell me only if you don't mind.

11
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:43,829
I am coming after beheading the wrong doer.

12
00:02:44,801 --> 00:02:47,548
Mister, if you joke at this time,

13
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:49,062
I can neither laugh,

14
00:02:49,427 --> 00:02:51,187
nor do I find it funny.

15
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,992
After I started using knives,

16
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,868
never found the use for jokes.

17
00:02:56,123 --> 00:02:57,457
Even this is not a joke.

18
00:02:57,533 --> 00:02:58,666
See for yourself.

19
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,550
3 MUKHI

20
00:04:27,315 --> 00:04:29,273
I am coming after
beheading the wrong doer.

21
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,919
Shailu...

22
00:04:35,096 --> 00:04:36,829
I need to talk to you urgently.

23
00:04:41,308 --> 00:04:43,497
What? Did he again come in your dream?

24
00:04:43,756 --> 00:04:44,756
Do one thing.

25
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:48,206
You either get married, or stop sleeping.

26
00:04:48,863 --> 00:04:50,840
Instead, just because you have a phone,

27
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:52,531
Don't call and bother me everyday.

28
00:04:53,404 --> 00:04:56,531
I'm unable to take my dad's anger
because of your daily calls,

29
00:04:57,232 --> 00:04:59,519
Every time my phone rings,
my dad doesn't think it's you.

30
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:01,785
He thinks it is my boy friend.

31
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:04,655
Look.

32
00:05:04,843 --> 00:05:06,880
If possible, I will quit sleeping.

33
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:09,851
If not, I will stop calling you.

34
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:13,207
But, I will never marry.

35
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:16,810
Do not talk like everybody does
before they fall in love.

36
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,332
Tell me something new.

37
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:21,955
Since you haven't met the right guy,
You are spoiled.

38
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:24,823
Once you fall in love,
Life will be like...

39
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:27,116
nothing but love, shall be on your mind.

40
00:05:27,248 --> 00:05:28,294
Will you please shut up?

41
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,916
No one here is craving for
silly stories and rosy talks.

42
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:33,326
Dear lord!

43
00:05:33,623 --> 00:05:35,176
Look at her confidence.

44
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,025
After such long talk,
if you don't come down and

45
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:41,544
make her realize,
then you won't be called the hero.

46
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:43,317
Where are you my lord?

47
00:05:43,996 --> 00:05:47,120
Wow, wow, wonderful!

48
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:49,538
In all the hands that
I have seen till now,

49
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:52,494
- This hand is in the Top Ten list.
- Huh?

50
00:05:52,568 --> 00:05:54,035
Man with such a hand,

51
00:05:54,295 --> 00:05:57,897
Must be a warrior with a sword,
fighting in the battle.

52
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,083
Otherwise...

53
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,668
He must be like the lord Krishna,
Who steals the hearts of the women.

54
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,616
By the way, what type are you my boy?

55
00:06:06,804 --> 00:06:09,367
I am the type that breaks
the fingers of the liars.

56
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:10,616
My God!

57
00:06:11,224 --> 00:06:14,501
Already I am pissed off that my
dream girl isn't coming into my dreams.

58
00:06:14,613 --> 00:06:15,873
If you know, tell me the reason,

59
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:17,063
don't tell me stories.

60
00:06:17,658 --> 00:06:20,720
To go behind her and see or to
go to her and propose,

61
00:06:20,742 --> 00:06:23,775
I need to know where is she and
how is she. First tell me that.

62
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:27,413
- In the age where you ooze...
- What?

63
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:31,607
What I mean is, in oozing youth,
it's common to see girls in dreams.

64
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,152
But, them not coming into your dream,
is a bad thing.

65
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:36,957
You don't worry.

66
00:06:37,132 --> 00:06:41,050
It is true that its difficult to
stop a aroused body and.

67
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:45,961
It is as much truth that,
it's about time you meet your dream girl.

68
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:47,840
It can happen today.

69
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:49,223
Or it can happen tomorrow.

70
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:53,465
It can be coincidental or
it can be accidental.

71
00:06:53,555 --> 00:06:57,799
But, What ever happens, it for your
own good. Remember that.

72
00:06:58,325 --> 00:06:59,980
I will remember it for sure.

73
00:07:00,443 --> 00:07:03,236
If things don't go the way
you said it would,

74
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,162
You would have it worse than...
Hope you understood.

75
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,247
I understood very well.

76
00:07:21,194 --> 00:07:22,255
Eh?

77
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
Who the heck!

78
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:42,770
Sorry Mister, It's a mistake.

79
00:07:47,512 --> 00:07:51,579
But, What ever happens, it for your
own good. Remember that.

80
00:07:52,457 --> 00:07:54,031
I hope she is not my girl.

81
00:07:54,712 --> 00:07:57,858
She seems alright. But...
Somehow not convincing.

82
00:07:59,663 --> 00:08:01,678
Hello... what is this?

83
00:08:01,988 --> 00:08:04,455
Are you okay or have
you gone blind?

84
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:05,826
I am really sorry.

85
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:08,996
Sorry what?
It's a brand new bike.

86
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,802
- You damaged it already.
- Sorry, I didn't see you coming.

87
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,182
Oh, My god! She is the dream girl.

88
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,756
At least you tell him
that the breaks failed.

89
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:49,216
He is...

90
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,330
He is...

91
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,577
Yeah. He is?

92
00:08:56,332 --> 00:09:00,265
Don't tell me he is the one
that frequents in your dreams.

93
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:02,775
Hmm...

94
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:06,058
Is he? Now see what I will do.

95
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,929
Keeping the victim in front of you,

96
00:09:11,258 --> 00:09:14,025
Why are gossiping like
you are at the water tap?

97
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:16,411
Not gossiping,
We should bite your head off.

98
00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:18,779
Won't you let the girls sleep?

99
00:09:18,996 --> 00:09:21,048
See how worried my friend is.

100
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:24,479
What is with you?
Will you come in her dreams everyday?

101
00:09:24,756 --> 00:09:28,182
Is it true? I was worried why I was not
seeing her in my dreams.

102
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:32,244
Now I get it.
I was with her, hence she was not coming.

103
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:37,942
It doesn't matter, You have come now.
That is all I need.

104
00:09:38,463 --> 00:09:41,445
Hey man! It seems what you said is
about to become truth.

105
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:43,750
If it does, then I will throw you a party.

106
00:09:47,224 --> 00:09:48,491
Where would you go?

107
00:09:48,602 --> 00:09:52,402
Once we are connected,
there is no question of leaving.

108
00:10:23,285 --> 00:10:24,285
Madam!

109
00:10:26,115 --> 00:10:27,288
I am done with the work.

110
00:10:58,644 --> 00:11:02,626
Why is he looking farther into the sky
and thinking deeply?

111
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:05,213
Hope he is not gonna ask for a loan.

112
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:13,289
To be on safer side,
it is better to hide the money from him.

113
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:23,011
What happened?
Why are pushing the scooter?

114
00:11:23,145 --> 00:11:27,542
Worst thing happened on the road,
I will never be respected again.

115
00:11:27,891 --> 00:11:29,829
Stop crying and tell me
what exactly happened.

116
00:11:29,852 --> 00:11:33,359
Nothing, I ran out of gas and money.
Thinking about how to get back now.

117
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:35,082
Are you crying for that?
I will give the money.

118
00:11:35,106 --> 00:11:35,888
Oh!

119
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:38,620
So he didn't call me for money?

120
00:11:39,114 --> 00:11:40,242
Then why did he call?

121
00:11:40,806 --> 00:11:42,496
Why don't I ask him?

122
00:11:42,775 --> 00:11:44,767
Hey Dude, Why are you looking dull?

123
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:46,498
Why did you call me here?
You are not planning...

124
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:49,599
Hope you aren't planning to buy
boats and make crores. Are you?

125
00:11:49,837 --> 00:11:50,837
Not that.

126
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:52,327
I saw a girl.

127
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:54,512
I like her a lot.

128
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,060
I will tell the rest of the story.

129
00:11:56,538 --> 00:11:58,153
But she didn't like you at all.

130
00:11:58,604 --> 00:12:00,170
So, I will push you into these waters.

131
00:12:00,776 --> 00:12:03,145
Then she will think
you jumped cause of her.

132
00:12:03,413 --> 00:12:06,366
She'll fall for you when hen
she comes to hospital to see you.

133
00:12:06,832 --> 00:12:07,950
Isn't that your plan?

134
00:12:08,782 --> 00:12:10,085
You don't worry a bit.

135
00:12:10,344 --> 00:12:12,810
Look at those colorful boats and pray.

136
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:17,263
I will push you into the water,
wet my eyes and call 108.

137
00:12:18,652 --> 00:12:20,852
Dude, What are you searching for?

138
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:24,277
Nothing.
What is that thing they use to park boats?

139
00:12:24,355 --> 00:12:25,759
- Do you mean Anchor?
- Yes.

140
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:28,035
I am not able to find it.
Where is it?

141
00:12:28,195 --> 00:12:29,226
Why do you need it?

142
00:12:29,481 --> 00:12:32,155
Aha! You guessed my problem
in a great way right?

143
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:34,976
I want to stab you with it
and hang you in the air.

144
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:36,741
Dude, why do you say that?

145
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,598
Then what? I called you to
give me a plan to meet the girl.

146
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:43,130
You are giving a plan to kill myself.

147
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:44,781
Oh! That's all?

148
00:12:45,074 --> 00:12:46,907
Why do you need a plan for that?

149
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:49,966
Go to the same place where
you met her and search a bit.

150
00:12:50,582 --> 00:12:52,002
What if I don't see her again?

151
00:12:52,232 --> 00:12:54,400
Or do we lodge a
missing complaint on her?

152
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,230
Don't kill me asking
for the other plans.

153
00:12:57,714 --> 00:12:58,722
Please dude.

154
00:13:29,356 --> 00:13:31,752
Dude, have you watched the movie 'Sholay'?

155
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:34,600
How can you forget such a movie?

156
00:13:34,754 --> 00:13:37,317
Senior NTR's acting in
that movie was awesome.

157
00:13:37,788 --> 00:13:41,800
In the climax, he kills that
magician with one blow.

158
00:13:42,128 --> 00:13:44,605
I can never forget that episode.
Its unforgettable.

159
00:13:44,675 --> 00:13:49,292
You fool, I am talking about Amitabh and
Dharmendra starrer 'Sholay'.

160
00:13:49,365 --> 00:13:52,118
- Oh!
- Not about Senior NTR's 'Pathalabhairavi'.

161
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:55,218
- You should have said that before hand.
- What would you have done?

162
00:13:55,924 --> 00:13:58,415
I would have agreed that I don't
understand Hindi. That's all.

163
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:00,440
Dude, I know you are an Idiot.

164
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:02,627
I can understand Hindi very well.

165
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,562
That is a very great movie.
Do you know one thing?

166
00:14:05,738 --> 00:14:08,766
To save Dharmendra's love,
Amitabh sacrifices his life.

167
00:14:08,887 --> 00:14:09,887
Ah!

168
00:14:10,256 --> 00:14:14,859
I knew you would link me to this movie,
the minute you stopped the bike,

169
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:18,571
Now, What do you want from me?
Do you want me to die like Amitabh? I can.

170
00:14:19,183 --> 00:14:22,745
- I'm not Prakash Raj in Pokiri to do that.
- Then?

171
00:14:22,804 --> 00:14:24,886
I am like Abbas in 'Prema Desam'.

172
00:14:24,918 --> 00:14:26,708
Thank god!
You didn't call yourself a fruit.

173
00:14:27,002 --> 00:14:28,135
I am your friend.

174
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,880
Ok. Ok. You seem to be ashamed to
ask something. What is it?

175
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,082
I won't mind.

176
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:37,313
Dude, for two minutes no matter what I do,
Don't ask anything.

177
00:14:37,353 --> 00:14:40,368
Unless it's a molestation,
I don't mind anything else.

178
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:45,823
Tell me, tell me you dirty toad.
Tell me, Tell me, Tell me.

179
00:14:45,915 --> 00:14:49,347
Tell me, Tell me, Tell me now.

180
00:14:49,445 --> 00:14:52,239
Tell me that you are the thief that stole
this ladies things.

181
00:14:52,261 --> 00:14:56,514
It's because of people like you
that Vizag sea is raising up.

182
00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:01,497
Say sorry to her and run far away from us.
Get lost.

183
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:04,940
Hello, Excuse me, do you
know what I have lost?

184
00:15:05,095 --> 00:15:08,705
Generally, girls like you lose
bracelets or ear rings.

185
00:15:08,788 --> 00:15:10,001
Did I get it right?

186
00:15:10,026 --> 00:15:11,026
You got it all wrong.

187
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:13,973
I don't like people who behave like this.

188
00:15:14,265 --> 00:15:15,796
What is with you Ganesh?

189
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:20,268
While he was hitting you, you could have
told him we know each other right?

190
00:15:25,365 --> 00:15:26,925
Did he give me a chance to speak?

191
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:29,563
He was bashing me like a washer man
with an old saree.

192
00:15:29,671 --> 00:15:31,734
Dude, did you know her from before?

193
00:15:31,816 --> 00:15:33,121
Of course I do.

194
00:15:33,252 --> 00:15:37,372
In four days, I, her and several others
are going to Araku to research on birds.

195
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:39,852
- I know her that well.
- Dude!

196
00:16:57,537 --> 00:16:58,537
Woof!

197
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:03,601
Have you lost your mind?

198
00:17:03,808 --> 00:17:05,292
You scared the shit out of me.

199
00:17:05,476 --> 00:17:08,563
You may think these practical jokes
are fun, but I almost died.

200
00:17:09,901 --> 00:17:12,265
Did you get it now?
That is why I told you.

201
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,808
You need a boy friend to
keep you brave and cuddle.

202
00:17:17,856 --> 00:17:21,163
Don't divert every topic I speak about
towards a boy friend.

203
00:17:21,418 --> 00:17:22,618
It pisses me off.

204
00:17:24,356 --> 00:17:27,090
Here, he must be the one to cool you off.

205
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:28,256
I will check.

206
00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:32,868
You?

207
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:35,505
Till day before,
you were only in her dream.

208
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:38,059
Now you have started to come to home.
What's up?

209
00:17:38,412 --> 00:17:41,428
Are you trying to hit on my friend?

210
00:17:41,526 --> 00:17:44,140
You are awesome,
if you predicted me so well,

211
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,271
You must have thought about me something.

212
00:17:46,383 --> 00:17:48,749
First,
tell me what your friend thought about me.

213
00:17:49,043 --> 00:17:52,526
- My heart is very eager to hear about it.
- Hello? Don't think that much.

214
00:17:53,017 --> 00:17:57,605
She is like Devayani in 'Suswagatam'.
She doesn't like love.

215
00:17:58,258 --> 00:18:01,375
Hello! Even you don't know
anything about me.

216
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:04,262
I am like Pawan Kalyan in 'Tholiprema'

217
00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:06,703
I can love like Crazy.

218
00:18:07,091 --> 00:18:08,571
- Huh!
- Really?

219
00:18:08,743 --> 00:18:10,409
I'll follow till she agrees.

220
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:11,691
You keep watching.

221
00:18:15,473 --> 00:18:18,647
What's up? Shailu said,
some idiot is fooling around with you?

222
00:18:26,527 --> 00:18:27,527
"Hey! Girl!"

223
00:18:40,515 --> 00:18:41,621
"Oh! Yeah!"

224
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:49,401
"Oh! Lady, you are cute like a red Apple"

225
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,953
"I want to bite you,
but you are running out of my reach."

226
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:58,005
"Oh! Lady, Like a high grapes,
You are making me mad."

227
00:18:58,418 --> 00:19:02,752
"I am trying to steal you beauty,
but you are seething very much."

228
00:19:03,455 --> 00:19:05,629
"Are you a Kohinoor diamond?"

229
00:19:05,643 --> 00:19:07,810
"Are you trying to play hide and seek?"

230
00:19:07,826 --> 00:19:10,024
"My eyes looking for you hurts,
have some mercy."

231
00:19:10,036 --> 00:19:14,803
"Signal OK to my love track."

232
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:20,038
"Oh! Lady, You are cute like a red Apple."

233
00:19:20,181 --> 00:19:24,217
"I want to bite you,
but you are running out of my reach."

234
00:19:24,554 --> 00:19:28,591
"Oh! Lady, Like a high grapes,
You are making me mad."

235
00:19:28,954 --> 00:19:33,287
"I am trying to steal you beauty,
but you are seething very much."

236
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:39,082
"Don't over act.
Many have tried and failed."

237
00:19:39,588 --> 00:19:43,371
"Don't waste your time,
Go... man, Go away!"

238
00:20:10,088 --> 00:20:12,548
"I saved my heart. Hai Rama."

239
00:20:12,763 --> 00:20:14,742
"I came till here, just for you.
Hai Rama."

240
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,760
"I made my heart a temple for you,
Hai Rama."

241
00:20:17,114 --> 00:20:21,205
"I worshiped you like a queen.
Hai Rama..."

242
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:25,725
"I am unable to sleep. Oh Rama!"

243
00:20:25,754 --> 00:20:27,854
"No hunger, No food.
Why is it dear?"

244
00:20:27,873 --> 00:20:30,355
"I see no difference between sun or rain.
What disease is this?"

245
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:32,744
"I am chanting your name day and night."

246
00:20:32,756 --> 00:20:36,528
"I love you so much,
Why don't you show mercy?"

247
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,811
"I think you are born for me,"

248
00:20:39,849 --> 00:20:43,029
"I jumped with joy and touched the sky."

249
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,500
"Hey, What's up baby?"

250
00:20:45,514 --> 00:20:46,530
"Look at me once baby."

251
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:48,355
"I like you a lot."

252
00:20:48,411 --> 00:20:50,692
"Without you, my life would be difficult."

253
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:52,899
"Did you think I am a fake lover?"

254
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,540
"Won't you learn my
love until I give my life?"

255
00:20:55,718 --> 00:20:56,718
"Oh god!"

256
00:20:57,387 --> 00:21:01,278
"Oh! Lady, you are cute like a red Apple."

257
00:21:01,684 --> 00:21:05,274
"I want to bite you, but you are running
out of my reach."

258
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:06,306
Get lost!

259
00:21:06,346 --> 00:21:09,946
"Oh! Lady, like unreachable grapes,
You are making me mad."

260
00:21:09,954 --> 00:21:10,962
Don't you understand?

261
00:21:10,994 --> 00:21:14,376
"I am trying to steal you beauty,
but you are seething very much."

262
00:21:14,391 --> 00:21:15,399
What the hell?

263
00:21:47,483 --> 00:21:49,703
"I lost my cool, looking at your figure."

264
00:21:49,738 --> 00:21:51,670
"I came wearing Jasmine perfume."

265
00:21:51,966 --> 00:21:53,867
"I lost my mind, watching your midriff."

266
00:21:54,128 --> 00:21:58,249
"I brought a coir bed behind you."

267
00:22:00,497 --> 00:22:02,764
"I was enticed by your petite neck."

268
00:22:02,896 --> 00:22:04,875
"I brought a diamond necklace for that."

269
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,956
"I was enthralled seeing your waist."

270
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,361
"I have ordered a gold belt for you."

271
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:13,769
"I am trying to control myself,
but seems impossible, babe."

272
00:22:14,237 --> 00:22:16,851
"Even if you say no,
I won't let you go."

273
00:22:16,854 --> 00:22:20,880
- "I will hold your hand and Kiss you.
- You!"

274
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:26,913
If you thought I will fall for your antics
and accept your love,

275
00:22:26,931 --> 00:22:28,090
I will knock your teeth out.

276
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:38,480
Dude,

277
00:22:38,521 --> 00:22:41,441
I am drinking for the sake of it.

278
00:22:41,968 --> 00:22:45,901
I am not able to forget the way
she insulted me in public.

279
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,617
What?
She slapped me in front of so many people.

280
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:59,883
Even my Mom and Dad won't get angry
with me, without giving it a thought.

281
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,333
But, She slapped me as easily as
she would yawn.

282
00:23:13,524 --> 00:23:14,524
You fool,

283
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:18,425
I am so worried here, you do
nothing but eat and drink?

284
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,197
Say something man.

285
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:23,631
I understand your pain dude.

286
00:23:24,255 --> 00:23:25,855
I have thought about it.

287
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:28,164
You have two solutions for this.

288
00:23:28,393 --> 00:23:30,326
First is to forget that girl.

289
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,172
Second,

290
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:36,321
To forget the insult made by that girl.

291
00:23:36,512 --> 00:23:37,845
- That's all.
- You fool.

292
00:23:38,045 --> 00:23:42,133
If I was to forgive or forget,
Why would I drink with you?

293
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:46,730
Instead I would have meditated for
ten minutes, when she hit me.

294
00:23:54,228 --> 00:23:56,133
Not all this,

295
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,182
I will kill her.

296
00:24:01,557 --> 00:24:02,557
Hey!

297
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,531
Dude, Are you drunk?

298
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,111
I am not.

299
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:08,461
She is drunk.

300
00:24:08,996 --> 00:24:11,730
Hey dude, What are you talking about man?

301
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,218
I have decided.

302
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,636
I will kill her.

303
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:22,058
I want you to be my partner in crime.
No arguments.

304
00:24:22,788 --> 00:24:23,788
Ok?

305
00:24:24,074 --> 00:24:25,550
What ok?

306
00:24:26,148 --> 00:24:27,426
What are you talking about?

307
00:24:28,062 --> 00:24:33,062
You are not doing Mango business,
to be thrilled when you say partnership.

308
00:24:33,687 --> 00:24:35,210
You are talking about murder.

309
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:38,280
Look, All of this wouldn't happen.

310
00:24:38,483 --> 00:24:41,038
Let's cover our faces with helmet and.

311
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,937
Pinch her and run away. Ok?

312
00:24:47,475 --> 00:24:51,818
To do what you ask me to do,
she didn't steal my wallet.

313
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,678
She took away my pride in front of people.

314
00:24:54,717 --> 00:24:59,067
You are even scared to get shots
for fever.

315
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:03,871
It's my mistake to call you my partner.
Get Lost.

316
00:25:04,426 --> 00:25:05,259
Hey, Dude.

317
00:25:05,322 --> 00:25:08,361
Hey, Hey.
There is another beer left out.

318
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,647
I will drink it tomorrow.

319
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:28,618
Last night, You said you won't come?

320
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:30,820
If I won't come, you won't talk to me.

321
00:25:30,939 --> 00:25:32,872
My father always used to say.

322
00:25:33,219 --> 00:25:35,159
I should not watch the family movies.

323
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:38,152
I didn't listen. I didn't.
I watched the same.

324
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,397
Now I am going through this.

325
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,403
Not just my dad, everyone are same.

326
00:25:45,183 --> 00:25:48,907
Dude, Don't come along with that mood.
I don't like it at all.

327
00:25:49,066 --> 00:25:53,452
But, if you are happy and Joyfuly,
encourge me, I will be victorious.

328
00:25:53,577 --> 00:25:54,577
What?

329
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:58,033
To be happy and joyfully encourage you,
you are not going for Olympics..

330
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:00,146
On behalf of India?
He needs happiness for that.

331
00:26:01,786 --> 00:26:03,540
Ok, Lets go. I can;T escape now.

332
00:26:03,802 --> 00:26:05,437
But, I am warning you now itself,

333
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,158
If you want to come to Araku with us,
you need our teacher's permission.

334
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:10,972
He is not a simple man.

335
00:26:11,394 --> 00:26:12,806
He is the star of the stars.

336
00:26:12,925 --> 00:26:15,591
He is the type that reviews movies
based on the title.

337
00:26:15,898 --> 00:26:19,686
He who can't enjoy a weekend and
He who has no weakness are very rare.

338
00:26:19,706 --> 00:26:22,373
Even your guy should have some weakness.

339
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:24,301
Let's search, We will find it.

340
00:26:24,373 --> 00:26:26,157
By the way, Where is your guy now?

341
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,727
What a beautiful girl!

342
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:32,297
Wow, Wow.

343
00:26:36,916 --> 00:26:38,116
Ju..Just a minute.

344
00:26:43,298 --> 00:26:44,298
Look, Anushka,

345
00:26:44,664 --> 00:26:47,264
Few drink because of
failure in love.

346
00:26:47,318 --> 00:26:51,339
Or because a lover cheated.

347
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:52,445
Isn't it?

348
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:57,266
But, I am drinking because,
I am sad that I am not able to

349
00:26:57,413 --> 00:27:02,235
express my love towards you.
That is why I am drinking.

350
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,208
Shit!

351
00:27:09,014 --> 00:27:10,014
Just a minute.

352
00:27:14,626 --> 00:27:19,195
I am trying to propose to you
many times, darling.

353
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:25,525
But in one or the other movie,
some Hero

354
00:27:25,664 --> 00:27:28,720
is proposing to you

355
00:27:29,444 --> 00:27:31,177
and you are falling for it.

356
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:39,722
But this time,
I am thinking to take a decision.

357
00:27:40,734 --> 00:27:45,848
Anushka, Be careful ok?
You will miss it this time as well.

358
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:51,131
If you want to know the Love
I have for you,

359
00:27:51,645 --> 00:27:55,762
You, yourself must come to me.
If you come that way,

360
00:27:56,059 --> 00:27:57,059
just a minute.

361
00:27:58,147 --> 00:28:02,935
I will stop drinking. Ok?
Will you come? Or you won't?

362
00:28:03,529 --> 00:28:04,616
She will come.

363
00:28:04,686 --> 00:28:05,886
Anushka will come.

364
00:28:07,193 --> 00:28:08,945
So, what do you want me to do?

365
00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:11,437
What? Do you want me to
Show her entire Araku?

366
00:28:11,735 --> 00:28:14,996
Whyy would I show her? Let her come
and see herself.

367
00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:17,441
Oh! Security problem?

368
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,710
Ok, However, you are my friend.
I will take her.

369
00:28:21,322 --> 00:28:22,698
What again?

370
00:28:23,111 --> 00:28:28,564
What? Anushka need 4 girls for company?
To Chit chat and roam around with?

371
00:28:29,092 --> 00:28:31,500
This is too much.
I am very sorry.

372
00:28:31,652 --> 00:28:33,452
I cannot do that one thing.

373
00:28:33,772 --> 00:28:36,068
I can show Araku to Anushka
Some other time.

374
00:28:36,084 --> 00:28:40,017
But for this once, ask her to go to
Singapore or Malaysia.

375
00:28:40,409 --> 00:28:43,324
Sir, Sir.
Don't hang up in hurry.

376
00:28:43,524 --> 00:28:44,791
Just a Minute. Sir.

377
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,233
You need Girls? I have them.

378
00:28:49,498 --> 00:28:51,273
You cut the call.
I will call you back.

379
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:54,625
Who the hell are you? You look
like a street hawker with dog toys.

380
00:28:54,639 --> 00:28:56,372
- Hey.
- What do you need?

381
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,883
I want Anushka.

382
00:29:00,224 --> 00:29:02,173
Did you think Anushka is
an ice cream in Cinema?

383
00:29:02,194 --> 00:29:03,697
To get you in the counter?
Get lost.

384
00:29:03,729 --> 00:29:07,152
Sir, Sir, you have misunderstood me.

385
00:29:07,492 --> 00:29:10,150
The meaning of, 'I want Anushka.' is...

386
00:29:10,157 --> 00:29:12,980
not that I want her for myself.

387
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:17,676
- Just, One time with Anushka...
- What?

388
00:29:19,989 --> 00:29:21,861
I want to meet her once.
That's all.

389
00:29:23,113 --> 00:29:26,676
I am a very big fan of Anushka.

390
00:29:27,921 --> 00:29:28,921
That is why,

391
00:29:29,103 --> 00:29:31,579
That is why, at least once in my life time,

392
00:29:31,635 --> 00:29:32,940
directly,

393
00:29:34,436 --> 00:29:36,718
I want to meet her.

394
00:29:37,832 --> 00:29:41,158
All you need is four girls right?
I will arrange them.

395
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:45,534
Please try to understand me.

396
00:29:45,787 --> 00:29:47,755
Its just my favor.

397
00:29:48,172 --> 00:29:49,844
I don't know, seeing you,

398
00:29:50,026 --> 00:29:52,643
you look like a super
fan, who would stand in

399
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:55,027
que on first day to
watch Anushka's movie.

400
00:29:55,616 --> 00:29:57,594
I will make you reach your goal.

401
00:29:57,801 --> 00:29:59,402
Don't worry. Ok?

402
00:29:59,525 --> 00:30:04,190
This is the right time to bring Anushka
on our track.

403
00:30:04,243 --> 00:30:05,702
What are you thinking?

404
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:08,042
Anushka is comig in another three days.

405
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,676
- About the arrangements there,
- You don't worry.

406
00:30:12,221 --> 00:30:14,728
I will take care of them all.

407
00:30:15,324 --> 00:30:17,666
We are leaving for the Araku tomorrow.

408
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,264
I found a right baffoon.
With this my path will be clear.

409
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:23,317
Now, with us, another important person
is also coming.

410
00:30:23,358 --> 00:30:24,794
He is a very important person.

411
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:29,749
He is so important that,
His hurt would be my pain.

412
00:30:29,914 --> 00:30:30,914
Really?

413
00:30:32,418 --> 00:30:33,418
Shut up.

414
00:30:33,837 --> 00:30:35,241
As long as he is with us,

415
00:30:35,331 --> 00:30:38,989
You should take care of him like you would
take care of a ironed Jeans pant.

416
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:40,006
Understood?

417
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:41,539
Yes sir.

418
00:30:41,615 --> 00:30:43,964
What is understood?
He and his stupid comparision.

419
00:30:44,061 --> 00:30:47,642
If he wasn't our teacher, I would've
killed him, Just with my eyes.

420
00:30:47,683 --> 00:30:49,846
I don't know who hired him as a faculty.

421
00:30:49,883 --> 00:30:51,550
You are saying something? Any doubt?

422
00:30:52,272 --> 00:30:55,952
She is eager to see the jean Pants
you talked about, it seems.

423
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,200
Yes sir. Yes.

424
00:30:58,131 --> 00:30:59,131
Girls!

425
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:02,901
Your foreseeing has come to an end.

426
00:31:03,178 --> 00:31:04,543
Hence, I am here.

427
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:06,173
Take a good look at me.

428
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:09,250
I am the six feet friendship that
Rambabu was talking about.

429
00:31:09,485 --> 00:31:15,691
I thought it must be him. He somehow
convinced the teacher and tagged along.

430
00:31:15,711 --> 00:31:18,025
What is this Rambabu?
You said beautiful girls and.

431
00:31:18,095 --> 00:31:20,053
Girls like radio jockeys you said.

432
00:31:20,068 --> 00:31:22,361
Where are they? I am not able to see them.

433
00:31:22,951 --> 00:31:25,228
Trusting you, I even gave my word.

434
00:31:26,241 --> 00:31:27,456
These are the girls.

435
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,482
They are all very innocent.

436
00:31:29,574 --> 00:31:32,692
Look Rambabu, I don't want innocent girls.

437
00:31:32,705 --> 00:31:37,484
I need smart girls,
Girls who would talk very freely.

438
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:39,417
Otherwise we lose trust with Anushka.

439
00:31:41,868 --> 00:31:44,972
What? Oh my god!
Why is she looking so angry?

440
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:47,139
She wouldn't bite me when
I am alone right?

441
00:31:47,346 --> 00:31:49,871
Oh! No, nothing like that.
She is a very good girl.

442
00:31:50,001 --> 00:31:53,231
These days, some idiot is harrassing her
in the name of Love.

443
00:31:53,373 --> 00:31:54,873
So she is slightly disturbed.

444
00:31:55,433 --> 00:31:56,751
That is why she looks like that.

445
00:31:56,884 --> 00:31:58,403
Is that so?

446
00:31:58,561 --> 00:32:00,139
I wasn't even given a hint.

447
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:01,798
Am I that stranger to you?

448
00:32:01,849 --> 00:32:03,293
Today onwards we are one.

449
00:32:03,486 --> 00:32:05,889
Who is the good girl?
Who is the cute girl? Okay?

450
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,571
Why is he making a scene?

451
00:32:08,097 --> 00:32:10,045
Buddy, Shall we start?

452
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,070
Yeah. Let's go.

453
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,435
What do you want to take?
Tell me.

454
00:32:20,621 --> 00:32:23,333
Rambabu, you know I don't booze.

455
00:32:23,752 --> 00:32:27,352
How can I quit the habit now?
It's impossible for me. Just water for me.

456
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:33,340
Seenu Dude, if you catch some one,
They are like fish on the plate. Isn't it?

457
00:32:33,557 --> 00:32:35,425
- Except thorns, nothing will be left, eh?
- No.

458
00:32:35,449 --> 00:32:38,097
Did you notice his antics?

459
00:32:38,353 --> 00:32:41,736
During childhood, I guess his mom
didn't feed him rice.

460
00:32:41,853 --> 00:32:44,649
Instead she must have fed him lies.

461
00:32:44,661 --> 00:32:47,949
By the way, Why is he behind us?

462
00:32:49,163 --> 00:32:52,884
If I am guessing right, he would have
also arranged a fight sequence.

463
00:32:54,423 --> 00:32:56,251
Yeah, even they are here. Idiots.

464
00:32:57,021 --> 00:32:58,021
Dude...

465
00:32:59,573 --> 00:33:02,419
Ask if beauties who came to araku,
would also be coming to our beds.

466
00:33:10,195 --> 00:33:13,679
Hey, why do you toil for these guys?

467
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:14,925
I alone am enough.

468
00:33:15,391 --> 00:33:18,192
Finish your drinks.

469
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:21,324
I will hit them till their
Shirts tear off.

470
00:33:21,397 --> 00:33:22,397
Come on.

471
00:33:27,513 --> 00:33:28,766
Oh damn!

472
00:33:29,295 --> 00:33:30,580
Ouch! My god!

473
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,461
Oh god! Ouch.

474
00:33:36,985 --> 00:33:39,718
Dude, Keeping a six feet man next to you,

475
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,283
Why did you do that?

476
00:33:41,747 --> 00:33:43,280
Went with such a force?

477
00:33:43,653 --> 00:33:44,758
But, one thing.

478
00:33:45,187 --> 00:33:47,147
For the reactions you gave
for every punch,

479
00:33:47,219 --> 00:33:50,219
every girl in the batch
have fallen for you.

480
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:53,557
Except my girl friend.

481
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:57,456
Dude, Do you really think, my reactions
moved them so much?

482
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,059
Not just moved, if it went on for another
moment,

483
00:34:00,084 --> 00:34:03,414
They themselves would have
finished those rowdies.

484
00:34:03,472 --> 00:34:07,786
By the way, for whom did you do this
daring for?

485
00:34:09,207 --> 00:34:10,210
For Shailu.

486
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,987
Huh? I saw you combing hair,
whenever you saw her,

487
00:34:14,012 --> 00:34:15,599
I knew you were trying to woo her.

488
00:34:15,624 --> 00:34:17,640
Anyways, its not my
concern, who you try to woo.

489
00:34:17,701 --> 00:34:19,571
- I have a small work. See you.
- Hey!

490
00:34:20,361 --> 00:34:21,694
This is a new place.

491
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:24,199
My whole body is batterred. Ouch!

492
00:34:24,426 --> 00:34:26,124
If you leave me at this time,

493
00:34:26,383 --> 00:34:29,435
My plight would be like Nagabhushanam
in 'Rakthakaneeru'.

494
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:32,349
Atleast be on my side till I recover.
Please.

495
00:34:32,608 --> 00:34:38,345
I am so sorry, Dude.
Tonight, I have decided to murder Nethra.

496
00:34:38,572 --> 00:34:43,529
If you still want, After murder,
I will wash my hands, come and sit here.

497
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:46,555
Until then,
You will have Doors for your company.

498
00:34:46,683 --> 00:34:47,749
Huh? What doors?

499
00:34:48,335 --> 00:34:50,220
Who is he? Is he not from India?

500
00:34:50,457 --> 00:34:54,146
What are you saying? He is Indian.
Also a telugite.

501
00:34:54,169 --> 00:34:55,766
His true name is Talupulu.

502
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:59,133
But he has two murder cases on him.
That's all.

503
00:34:59,573 --> 00:35:00,573
That's it?

504
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:05,508
Is it fair for you to put me
with a murderer?

505
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,538
Dude, for that matter, even I am here
to murder her right?

506
00:35:08,586 --> 00:35:11,382
Only difference is, He is a senior,
I am a junior. That's all.

507
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,015
Now he is a servant here.

508
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,837
He must be sharpening knives to
cut the vegetables.

509
00:35:15,872 --> 00:35:18,133
You be here, I will go get him.

510
00:35:18,453 --> 00:35:19,913
Hey! Hey!

511
00:35:58,538 --> 00:36:00,188
- Hey...
- Huh?

512
00:36:02,455 --> 00:36:03,546
What are you doing here?

513
00:36:04,148 --> 00:36:05,528
Nothing Sir.

514
00:36:06,356 --> 00:36:10,059
I came to take order for dinner sir.

515
00:36:10,191 --> 00:36:12,991
If you cook, they can even eat me and you.

516
00:36:13,091 --> 00:36:15,185
They have no specific taste,

517
00:36:15,365 --> 00:36:20,311
you cook what you can. If they eat,
Fine, or we will belt it. What say?

518
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:23,924
By the way, there is a man in
there who is in pain.

519
00:36:24,088 --> 00:36:26,851
Go to him and stay with him. Go.

520
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:38,596
Poor chap, Ganesh.

521
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:42,954
He tried to impress me through fight. But
now he is not able to get up.

522
00:36:42,994 --> 00:36:46,061
I will quickly go, talk to him
and come back.

523
00:36:46,332 --> 00:36:47,752
You need not go.

524
00:36:47,986 --> 00:36:49,586
He got what he deserved.

525
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,958
He introduced me to Sreenu
and has put me in a soup.

526
00:36:54,553 --> 00:36:58,901
Instead of him, if that Sreenu got hit,
I would have treated you with sweets.

527
00:36:59,152 --> 00:37:00,152
Holy God!

528
00:37:00,672 --> 00:37:02,489
How much grudge do you hold on me?

529
00:37:03,317 --> 00:37:07,080
Tonight, I will play a very
hard prank on you.

530
00:37:08,922 --> 00:37:10,937
By the way, where is this Rambabu?

531
00:37:12,342 --> 00:37:15,405
Hi Anushka, How are you?

532
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:19,114
Why are you staring at me that way?

533
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:24,434
May be ytou haven't seen a more
Handsome man in your circles.

534
00:37:24,626 --> 00:37:26,297
No. Not a chance.

535
00:37:27,265 --> 00:37:28,798
What have you seen yet?

536
00:37:28,921 --> 00:37:32,854
Once upon a time, do you know
what my friends used to say?

537
00:37:33,054 --> 00:37:34,603
They said Rambabu...

538
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:40,087
Vizag has sea
on one side and you on the other.

539
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:44,161
Else Vizag wouldn't have sustained.

540
00:37:45,835 --> 00:37:46,835
Mr. Rambabu?

541
00:37:47,263 --> 00:37:51,383
I saw everything.
You can hide nothing.

542
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:55,990
Sweat on your tender face
is telling the story loud and clear.

543
00:37:56,055 --> 00:37:57,717
That you are hiding your girl's pic.

544
00:37:57,931 --> 00:38:00,253
Come on tell me. Who is that lucky girl?

545
00:38:00,851 --> 00:38:02,698
That is... I can't.

546
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,994
I won't show you. You may become serious,
if you see who it is.

547
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,667
Why would I become serious?

548
00:38:08,808 --> 00:38:10,315
This is all common in this age.

549
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:12,666
- That too, you have a boiling blood.
- Yeah. That's right.

550
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:13,823
Show me. It's Ok.

551
00:38:16,373 --> 00:38:17,905
Rambabu, What are you doing?

552
00:38:18,512 --> 00:38:21,280
I thought you are good guy.
I was about to introducae you to Anushka.

553
00:38:21,336 --> 00:38:23,940
My God! You seem to be in a different plan
altogether?

554
00:38:23,997 --> 00:38:25,179
Just a minute.

555
00:38:25,647 --> 00:38:27,114
There is nothing here.

556
00:38:27,937 --> 00:38:30,842
- Do you know what is the thing here?
- What?

557
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,850
I will tell you,
as clearly as a mirror. Shall I?

558
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:37,882
- Tell me.
- I am not just a great fan of Anushka.

559
00:38:38,303 --> 00:38:42,171
I also a lover,
who is madly in love with her.

560
00:38:43,672 --> 00:38:49,627
I want to convince Anushka and marry her.
That is my ultimate wish. Any Objection?

561
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:52,826
What? Anushka? Marriage?

562
00:38:52,909 --> 00:38:55,497
Why are you awestruck at that?

563
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:56,758
Why?

564
00:38:57,628 --> 00:38:59,362
Won't Anushka get married?

565
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:01,526
Won't she have a husband?

566
00:39:01,916 --> 00:39:03,404
Won't she have children?

567
00:39:03,429 --> 00:39:07,647
Why till there? In the movie,
Jagadeka Veerudu, Athiloka Sundari,

568
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,354
Didn't Chiranjeevi love an Angel?

569
00:39:10,768 --> 00:39:14,018
In the Movie,
'Sahasa veerudu, Saagara kanya',

570
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:17,053
Didn't Venkatesh fall for a fish?

571
00:39:17,332 --> 00:39:18,490
Chuck all these.

572
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:22,942
If you think that I should forget
Anushka,

573
00:39:23,844 --> 00:39:25,310
I will commit suicide.

574
00:39:25,376 --> 00:39:28,029
He seems to do, what he just said.
Why should I bother.

575
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:30,904
Control yourself. Control Yourself.
Rambabu, Control yourself.

576
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:33,161
What ever you may say, Mr.Sreenu,

577
00:39:33,574 --> 00:39:38,781
Till I marry Anushka,
I will never let my eyes sleep,

578
00:39:39,234 --> 00:39:40,613
I will never sleep.

579
00:39:40,936 --> 00:39:42,870
I will not let Anushka sleep.

580
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:46,930
This is bull shit. If he doesn't sleep
the whole day, how will I work?

581
00:39:47,321 --> 00:39:48,721
What should I do now?

582
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,991
Thank god! My luck or his bad luck,
It's a power cut at the right time.

583
00:39:54,071 --> 00:39:55,837
Arey! We lost power. It's gone.

584
00:39:56,064 --> 00:40:00,000
Did you see Rambabu, In orderr to hide
your eye bags from Anushka,

585
00:40:00,035 --> 00:40:02,846
That you need to sleep,
God has taken out power as well.

586
00:40:02,912 --> 00:40:05,262
Now you sleep well. Bye. Good night.

587
00:40:05,688 --> 00:40:06,793
Good night, Good night.

588
00:40:06,841 --> 00:40:09,888
God! Do we have to lose
power at this time?

589
00:40:10,587 --> 00:40:14,741
Hey Doors, you lit the candles,
now speak something.

590
00:40:15,152 --> 00:40:16,984
I am also very scared.

591
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,840
Sir... Yeah...

592
00:40:23,072 --> 00:40:27,663
that girl looks like a red tomato.
Who is she?

593
00:40:27,688 --> 00:40:29,621
- What? Are you trying English?
- Yes.

594
00:40:30,935 --> 00:40:32,837
Why are you asking about that girl?

595
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:34,041
Is this efffect of cinemas?

596
00:40:34,444 --> 00:40:36,244
What are you talking sir?

597
00:40:36,437 --> 00:40:39,634
She is the cutest among all of them.

598
00:40:39,652 --> 00:40:40,865
That is why I asked.

599
00:40:40,903 --> 00:40:42,609
Tell me that way. Ouch!

600
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,943
Her name is Nethra.

601
00:40:45,692 --> 00:40:50,043
Our guy has not just reserved her,
He has already taken her into his heart.

602
00:40:50,363 --> 00:40:52,363
Do you know one more thing?

603
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,396
In the anger that she
rejected his proposal,

604
00:40:56,631 --> 00:40:58,502
He has come all the way here to kill her.
Oh!

605
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:00,378
But he really cannot do that.

606
00:41:01,427 --> 00:41:03,831
Because, Basically he is a very good guy.

607
00:41:04,183 --> 00:41:08,916
If needed, he will watch Mallika
Sheravat's 'Murder' another 30 times.

608
00:41:09,492 --> 00:41:10,864
He cannot murder anyone.

609
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:15,929
Huh! I guess he got scared
when I mentioned murder.

610
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:21,887
I was alone buddy, power went off.
I got scared.

611
00:41:22,526 --> 00:41:23,993
Son of a... Sleep off.

612
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,635
Nethra...

613
00:41:42,227 --> 00:41:45,229
My god! How well are you sleeping?

614
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:49,477
When every one uses acid on their lovers,

615
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,858
For a change,
I am trying to use fear against her.

616
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:56,379
Tonight, I will introduce you to fear and.

617
00:41:56,484 --> 00:41:59,684
After that I will decide on how to
murder you.

618
00:42:00,229 --> 00:42:02,737
Nethra...

619
00:42:05,713 --> 00:42:08,379
Nethra...

620
00:42:13,818 --> 00:42:15,921
Nethra...

621
00:42:19,492 --> 00:42:22,642
Nethra...

622
00:43:01,574 --> 00:43:03,820
I am already dying out of mental fear.

623
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:07,734
Are you trying to scare me
even more with your sounds?

624
00:43:08,042 --> 00:43:12,139
I can't get scared everyday for the death
that comes only once.

625
00:43:12,166 --> 00:43:17,114
If you want to kill me, Kill me at once.
Kill me, Kill me.

626
00:43:17,153 --> 00:43:18,153
Nethra...

627
00:43:33,893 --> 00:43:38,944
Holy Mother! I came to scare her,
instead she showed me a horror movie.

628
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,800
Oh My god!

629
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,404
Is it necessary to come to such a place at
such a time?

630
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:49,043
For people like us,
This is the need of the hour.

631
00:43:55,816 --> 00:43:59,482
We are already scared,
Why are you wearing that scarf?

632
00:44:00,766 --> 00:44:05,485
When we are going to steal,
it's basic to cover your face.

633
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,449
One shouldn't forget.
You still didn't stop stealing?

634
00:44:08,597 --> 00:44:10,264
Loving you is my mistake.

635
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:13,135
But wearing this,
What are you going to steal now?

636
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:16,153
I am wearing this to steal your heart.

637
00:44:16,382 --> 00:44:18,048
I am getting scared here.

638
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:21,697
Why fear? When the naughty thief is here?
Be back in a minute.

639
00:44:32,249 --> 00:44:34,859
Hello, Hi Sweety,

640
00:44:35,001 --> 00:44:37,886
What are you doing?
I miss you dear.

641
00:44:38,665 --> 00:44:39,665
I love you...

642
00:44:53,504 --> 00:44:56,549
Revathi,
heard ghost had a go at you last night?

643
00:44:56,941 --> 00:45:00,440
Oh! Let it be, by the way,
where is Venkat?

644
00:45:01,012 --> 00:45:05,150
Oh! You saw the ghost last night but,
your guy got the fever. Huh?

645
00:45:05,675 --> 00:45:09,342
You know what? Last night even Nethra
went through the same thing.

646
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:10,966
I don't believe it.

647
00:45:11,468 --> 00:45:13,095
I don't want to prove it to you.

648
00:45:14,229 --> 00:45:15,697
It's Okay if I don't believe.

649
00:45:15,834 --> 00:45:19,634
But if Anushka hears this,
she will go back right away.

650
00:45:19,877 --> 00:45:22,557
After that, if some one feels bad, then
It's not my responsibility.

651
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:24,379
I am talking to you itself.

652
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:27,784
Just bringing a boquet is not enough.
Give them some courage.

653
00:45:27,798 --> 00:45:30,531
Yeah, Yeah. What Mr.Sreenu said is right.

654
00:45:30,576 --> 00:45:33,607
How can we believe in ghosts in today's
world. Mr.Sreenu also lives there.

655
00:45:33,885 --> 00:45:36,796
It doesn't look like you are making
them brave. But its like making me...

656
00:45:37,223 --> 00:45:39,076
- Ms. Anushka is here.
- Ms.Anushka.

657
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,100
Come, come.

658
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:42,151
She is here. She's here.

659
00:45:44,501 --> 00:45:45,634
Hello, excuse me.

660
00:45:46,548 --> 00:45:49,684
Welcome Ma'am, Welcome.
A warm welcome to Araku.

661
00:45:49,724 --> 00:45:51,457
- Thank You.
- How are you?

662
00:45:51,545 --> 00:45:53,401
I am fine. How are you?

663
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,484
I am good Madam.

664
00:46:00,093 --> 00:46:03,302
Anushka have tied scarf,
covering her face. I don't agree.

665
00:46:04,325 --> 00:46:06,302
Only cause she has covered,
She has come this far.

666
00:46:06,421 --> 00:46:09,491
Otherwise, all the people at burra caves
would have been behind her.

667
00:46:09,511 --> 00:46:10,777
Yeah, that's right.

668
00:46:10,887 --> 00:46:13,145
She did the right thing covering herself.

669
00:46:13,206 --> 00:46:16,359
If we talk secretly like this,
Ms. Anushkawould feel bad.

670
00:46:16,418 --> 00:46:19,283
- Let's go.
- Yeah, You are right.

671
00:46:19,682 --> 00:46:25,377
Ms. Anushka,
you won't face any problem here.

672
00:46:25,446 --> 00:46:26,512
This is Rambabu.

673
00:46:26,536 --> 00:46:28,192
He is a very big fan of your's.

674
00:46:28,348 --> 00:46:30,124
He is the one who managed everything here.

675
00:46:30,206 --> 00:46:33,339
Then, These girls here,
Will take care of you,

676
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:36,511
as far as you re in Araku.

677
00:46:36,552 --> 00:46:39,013
Almost, They are going to take care of you
Like a queen.

678
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:41,801
Meaning, like your QueensMaids.

679
00:46:42,041 --> 00:46:43,774
He is crossing his limits.

680
00:46:43,815 --> 00:46:45,549
Is she really Mrs. Anushka?

681
00:46:46,085 --> 00:46:47,085
I doubt it.

682
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:49,575
Why would she come here?

683
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:51,809
Rambabu is being made a fool.

684
00:46:54,755 --> 00:46:56,221
By the way, Who is he?

685
00:46:56,704 --> 00:46:59,692
He is 'Long Long Ago Nagarjuna'

686
00:47:00,437 --> 00:47:01,437
Don't worry,

687
00:47:01,792 --> 00:47:06,294
Since everyone said he looked like
Nagarjuna,

688
00:47:06,402 --> 00:47:11,801
He moved to Hyderabad and
roamed around looking for movie chances.

689
00:47:13,145 --> 00:47:15,932
Oh! He got a chance then?

690
00:47:15,998 --> 00:47:21,073
No, He got a realization. That along with
looks, We also need luck to succeed.

691
00:47:21,146 --> 00:47:24,508
But he still keeps trying
with hope to succeed.

692
00:47:24,818 --> 00:47:26,246
Bu for livelihood,

693
00:47:26,355 --> 00:47:28,665
He joined with Ms. Anushka as a PA.

694
00:47:28,798 --> 00:47:29,837
It's going good.

695
00:47:29,933 --> 00:47:34,545
Enough of talking about me.
Where are our rooms?

696
00:47:34,789 --> 00:47:35,789
Yeah, Lets go.

697
00:48:13,151 --> 00:48:14,151
Dude,

698
00:48:14,271 --> 00:48:16,604
Why is he crying like a stung baby?

699
00:48:16,931 --> 00:48:19,428
Did he see his reflection in his
beer or what?

700
00:48:19,476 --> 00:48:23,343
No man, someone told him
that the guest house has ghosts.

701
00:48:23,665 --> 00:48:25,402
He is a fool, right? He believed.

702
00:48:28,437 --> 00:48:29,437
Hey Nagarjuna,

703
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,140
Hello,

704
00:48:31,591 --> 00:48:33,006
Hello Mr. Junior Nagarjuna.

705
00:48:33,617 --> 00:48:36,379
I don't think you know completely
about me and him.

706
00:48:36,502 --> 00:48:39,495
Me and my friend here are the kind of
people, who fall in love with ghosts.

707
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,133
Already we did two three
acid attacks on the ghosts.

708
00:48:43,193 --> 00:48:48,342
In Vizag, if a ghost sees us,
They cower and hide in crematoriums.

709
00:48:48,826 --> 00:48:51,055
Having such people around,
How can you be afraid?

710
00:48:51,204 --> 00:48:52,737
Dude, this is not good.

711
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:54,694
If you are Nagarjuna, how should you be?

712
00:48:55,025 --> 00:48:56,980
You should be like unbeatable 'Mass'

713
00:48:57,259 --> 00:48:58,974
but you seem like a whithered old man.

714
00:48:59,168 --> 00:49:00,168
Sit straight.

715
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:01,990
It's not about that sir.

716
00:49:02,296 --> 00:49:06,203
He introduced my wife as
Anushka to everyone.

717
00:49:06,835 --> 00:49:11,381
That old man, is excitingly looking
up and down, towards her.

718
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:15,393
Along side, My wife has sleep walking
habit sir.

719
00:49:18,134 --> 00:49:22,152
If by chance, she walks into
that man's room,

720
00:49:22,596 --> 00:49:27,152
My god! My god!
I am even afraid to think about it.

721
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,464
Is this it?

722
00:49:30,554 --> 00:49:33,117
If this is your fear,
you can be very happy.

723
00:49:33,308 --> 00:49:36,048
He won't do anything to your wife.
He can't as well.

724
00:49:38,861 --> 00:49:40,614
How can you be so sure?

725
00:49:40,764 --> 00:49:42,934
Why because, he is a gay.

726
00:49:43,435 --> 00:49:46,334
Like you said, if he is gay,

727
00:49:46,894 --> 00:49:50,441
He should be the fan of Muscular
Salman khan or Hrithik Roshan.

728
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:52,958
Why is he being an Anushka's fan?

729
00:49:52,975 --> 00:49:54,975
By the way, whose fan are you?

730
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:58,053
- Megastar Chiranjeevi.
- Oh crap.

731
00:49:58,238 --> 00:49:59,341
You are a man. Right?

732
00:49:59,412 --> 00:50:02,532
You are a man right? You must be a fan of
Mumaith Khan or Madhuri dikshit.

733
00:50:02,557 --> 00:50:03,935
Why are you a Megastar fan?

734
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,996
That is affection.

735
00:50:06,052 --> 00:50:07,920
Yeah, so is his. Affection.

736
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,221
Do you know what he
will be doing at this time?

737
00:50:11,266 --> 00:50:16,333
What else? Weather is cold, He would
be wrapped up in a blanket and asleep.

738
00:50:16,462 --> 00:50:19,196
That is where you are going
terribly wrong.

739
00:50:20,093 --> 00:50:21,226
He means the leg.

740
00:50:21,292 --> 00:50:24,521
Yeah. I will show you, what he will be
doig now. Let's go.

741
00:50:24,796 --> 00:50:27,525
All these days I was concentrating on
Bird watching.

742
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:29,392
I forgot about my body.

743
00:50:29,543 --> 00:50:32,532
That is why it is like a torn down road.

744
00:50:32,961 --> 00:50:35,373
I will not let it happen here after.

745
00:50:36,031 --> 00:50:40,872
I will amplify my beauty and make Anushka
go mad.

746
00:50:43,088 --> 00:50:45,688
What is this? When every one is asleep,

747
00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:48,669
Why is he doing such things?
Is he mad or something?

748
00:50:48,955 --> 00:50:50,822
It's not madness, It's lust.

749
00:50:51,044 --> 00:50:54,306
He won't let any new rooster that enters
the Compound escape without tasting.

750
00:50:54,349 --> 00:50:56,482
That is what he is planning now.

751
00:51:01,257 --> 00:51:03,989
By the way, who is that new rooster?

752
00:51:04,014 --> 00:51:05,442
- Who else? It's you.
- What?

753
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,383
It is not safe to be seen by him
again and again.

754
00:51:15,423 --> 00:51:17,423
First you get out of here. Go.

755
00:51:21,508 --> 00:51:22,508
Thank god!

756
00:51:25,418 --> 00:51:26,418
Hey.

757
00:51:26,455 --> 00:51:29,013
His wife just sleep walked
into Rambabu's room.

758
00:51:29,213 --> 00:51:29,600
Oh...

759
00:51:29,806 --> 00:51:32,652
If he holds her thinking that
she is Anushka, We are done.

760
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,405
- You stay here and keep watching.
- Ok.

761
00:51:34,464 --> 00:51:37,544
- I will go there and stop it.
- Ok. You go.

762
00:51:46,941 --> 00:51:49,808
What is she doing in my room
at this hour?

763
00:51:49,958 --> 00:51:54,025
Aha! If she sees me in this getup, She
will die out of fear.

764
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:56,353
I should cover my face and manage.

765
00:52:00,585 --> 00:52:02,550
Come, Ms.Anushka.
Please come in.

766
00:52:03,946 --> 00:52:05,874
You came to my room for the first time.

767
00:52:06,847 --> 00:52:07,847
Just a minute.

768
00:52:08,129 --> 00:52:12,719
Would you like to have something?
Tea, coffee, Bournvita or Boost.

769
00:52:13,266 --> 00:52:14,269
Whatever you like.

770
00:52:15,012 --> 00:52:17,733
What happened?
Why are you so silent?

771
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:22,875
Oh! Are you angry that I am
hiding my face?

772
00:52:22,908 --> 00:52:25,393
I have a reason for it.
I will tell you.

773
00:52:25,744 --> 00:52:30,270
But then, you shouldn't get serious.
I know you wouldn't.

774
00:52:30,299 --> 00:52:35,183
Because, if you didn't like me,
Why would you be in my room at this time?

775
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:38,012
What say? That's why,
I have a surprise for you.

776
00:52:38,254 --> 00:52:42,708
Just for my satisfaction,
I will propose you once

777
00:52:43,011 --> 00:52:47,371
I love you. I love you so much.

778
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:49,088
If you really like me,

779
00:52:50,157 --> 00:52:55,833
before I count 1 to 3, even you will say
I love you too. Ok?

780
00:52:58,695 --> 00:53:03,480
One. Two. Three...

781
00:53:03,923 --> 00:53:05,590
Why is there no response?

782
00:53:10,943 --> 00:53:11,943
Damn!

783
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:15,383
You said it in haste.
You should have waited four more days.

784
00:53:15,605 --> 00:53:17,138
Now see. She is angry.

785
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:19,531
I should immediately go and apologize.

786
00:53:23,636 --> 00:53:24,938
By the way, Venkat,

787
00:53:25,065 --> 00:53:28,076
you said ghost played a role with you,
correct? How was it?

788
00:53:28,296 --> 00:53:33,478
I just saw her outside.
She isn't that great. Just average.

789
00:53:33,508 --> 00:53:34,513
That's all.

790
00:53:34,532 --> 00:53:37,482
Since then, your Rambabu sir
is also missing.

791
00:53:37,649 --> 00:53:39,721
I thought he is here.
Just came to check.

792
00:53:39,807 --> 00:53:41,901
What? My sir is missing?

793
00:53:42,182 --> 00:53:44,389
Did my sir finish his life already?

794
00:53:44,404 --> 00:53:46,004
Is he done? Is he gone?

795
00:53:46,036 --> 00:53:47,770
Is he gone? Hey, Stop it.

796
00:53:48,515 --> 00:53:50,182
You and your sorry faces.

797
00:53:50,222 --> 00:53:52,089
Go and search for your sir.

798
00:54:08,569 --> 00:54:09,569
Mr. Rambabu?

799
00:54:16,963 --> 00:54:18,229
Babu... Mr.Rambabu.

800
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,835
- Sir...
- Sir.

801
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:38,905
Where is my sir?

802
00:54:44,686 --> 00:54:45,686
Sir... Sir.

803
00:54:56,589 --> 00:54:57,589
Mr.Rambabu?

804
00:55:06,188 --> 00:55:09,862
Ms.Anushka... Ms.Anushka.

805
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,925
Already we have come very far.

806
00:55:13,555 --> 00:55:14,801
Let's go back.

807
00:55:15,247 --> 00:55:16,738
I apologized right?

808
00:55:17,036 --> 00:55:20,303
If you get angry on me,
My heart can't take it.

809
00:55:21,523 --> 00:55:23,669
I don't know, I am
that crazy about you.

810
00:55:24,368 --> 00:55:27,944
With such a beautiful heroine,
during mid night.

811
00:55:28,437 --> 00:55:31,979
I never thought I would be alone
like this.

812
00:55:32,673 --> 00:55:34,073
But, What is the use?

813
00:55:34,183 --> 00:55:36,912
You still didn't show me your face

814
00:55:37,558 --> 00:55:41,075
at last, you are not removing your scarf
even in the night.

815
00:55:42,021 --> 00:55:43,554
Nobody is around.

816
00:55:44,864 --> 00:55:49,398
May be, you are so shy to show
that beautiful face of yours,

817
00:55:49,442 --> 00:55:52,568
I will remove your scarf mysellf.
Ok?

818
00:55:52,963 --> 00:55:58,537
Darling, oh my Darling.
Darling, oh my darling.

819
00:55:58,657 --> 00:56:01,887
Darling. Argh... Oh my! Darling!

820
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,132
What if we see the ghost?

821
00:56:10,712 --> 00:56:12,206
Oh my! Darling.
Darling. Darling.

822
00:56:12,811 --> 00:56:13,881
Ghost!

823
00:56:14,566 --> 00:56:15,566
Darling...

824
00:56:18,401 --> 00:56:20,565
It's coming after us.

825
00:56:30,699 --> 00:56:33,633
Oh! You are here.
I was searching all over.

826
00:56:34,112 --> 00:56:36,045
By the way, where is Rambabu?

827
00:56:36,517 --> 00:56:40,958
Anyways, He will manage to come back.
If your husband knows this, he will die.

828
00:56:41,026 --> 00:56:42,026
Let's go.

829
00:56:47,089 --> 00:56:50,480
Oh my god! I am dead.

830
00:56:57,461 --> 00:56:58,461
Dude!

831
00:56:58,976 --> 00:57:01,885
I am trying to not ask you,
but unable to stop.

832
00:57:02,258 --> 00:57:06,144
You said you saw the ghost right?
How is she? Is she sexy?

833
00:57:11,212 --> 00:57:14,012
Did you ask how she is?
She is very cute.

834
00:57:14,493 --> 00:57:17,293
None of our heroines can match her beauty.

835
00:57:17,307 --> 00:57:19,418
I some how managed to bare that beauty.

836
00:57:19,442 --> 00:57:22,167
If you were there, you would
have eaten her alive.

837
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:23,773
Is it? Oh!

838
00:57:24,496 --> 00:57:25,496
I missed it.

839
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,085
Dude, if you see it again,

840
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,813
Tell her I said Hi.

841
00:57:31,467 --> 00:57:35,476
Why say Hi? Next time when I see her,
I will give a missed call.

842
00:57:35,491 --> 00:57:41,153
You come running and kiss her
on her lips. Ok?

843
00:57:41,226 --> 00:57:45,357
You son of a gun, I am shivering
at the thought of her,

844
00:57:45,418 --> 00:57:47,760
You are asking me, how she is.

845
00:57:48,972 --> 00:57:49,972
Sorry Dude.

846
00:57:50,437 --> 00:57:51,955
Don't get serious. Go to sleep.

847
00:57:52,155 --> 00:57:55,717
How can I sleep? As soon I sleep,
I am seeing that ghost in my dreams.

848
00:57:56,023 --> 00:57:58,830
Shut your eyes, think about Nethra
and sleep.

849
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:01,537
Along with sleep,
you will also dream about song.

850
00:58:01,609 --> 00:58:03,276
- Do you think so?
- That's all.

851
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:13,422
- Kill me!
- Nethra...

852
00:58:16,236 --> 00:58:19,636
There is a relation between
that ghost and Nethra.

853
00:58:20,986 --> 00:58:24,679
What are you thinking about? Is it about
what roof to use for your barn?

854
00:58:24,823 --> 00:58:25,823
Not that.

855
00:58:26,368 --> 00:58:28,053
About what to do if the ghost returns?

856
00:58:28,227 --> 00:58:30,533
What does it know to keep
coming back to us?

857
00:58:30,824 --> 00:58:32,491
If it is like this after death,

858
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:34,808
I am not sure how many men
it spoiled before death.

859
00:58:35,218 --> 00:58:38,588
It is not coming for you or for me.
It is coming for Nethra.

860
00:58:41,699 --> 00:58:44,151
So was it a male ghost or a female ghost?

861
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:47,293
- I'm not sure.
- These days ghosts are so inconsiderate.

862
00:58:47,396 --> 00:58:49,079
No use with Police complaint as well.

863
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:51,220
They are even unable to catch
the ones who are alive.

864
00:58:51,265 --> 00:58:54,156
What would they do about the dead ones?
If they can't, We will.

865
00:58:54,276 --> 00:58:56,120
I have a nice plan. Come closer.

866
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,140
- Wow!
- Yeah.

867
00:59:00,712 --> 00:59:02,167
Done. Very nice.

868
00:59:16,604 --> 00:59:18,658
Its me. Sreenu.

869
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:20,400
Oh my god!

870
00:59:20,917 --> 00:59:23,738
I am, being a man, am scared of your
get up.

871
00:59:23,806 --> 00:59:25,293
Won't that girl be scared?

872
00:59:25,591 --> 00:59:27,333
Nothing like that, you stay here

873
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:29,477
- and make sure, nobody comes in.
- Ok.

874
00:59:29,737 --> 00:59:32,070
Tonight, Nethra's work is finished.

875
00:59:32,757 --> 00:59:33,757
See you later.

876
00:59:33,795 --> 00:59:35,099
Hey... stop.

877
00:59:35,274 --> 00:59:37,842
I am not brave enough to get
a picture with the ghost.

878
00:59:37,938 --> 00:59:41,819
However you are in a ghost getup.
I will get a selfie with you. Please man.

879
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,575
Okay, Make it fast.

880
00:59:48,555 --> 00:59:50,735
- It's nice.
- Ok. See you.

881
00:59:50,801 --> 00:59:51,801
Thanks Dude.

882
00:59:55,105 --> 00:59:56,105
Selfie.

883
00:59:56,685 --> 00:59:58,573
How is it? Good?

884
01:00:01,102 --> 01:00:04,035
What? What are you doing
here at this time?

885
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:06,757
Where did that Sreenu go?

886
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:09,136
He is not seen since morning.

887
01:00:09,336 --> 01:00:10,336
Hey!

888
01:00:10,383 --> 01:00:15,648
If I see him, I will make him
dissappear permanently. You know?

889
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:18,111
He cheated me so much.

890
01:00:19,475 --> 01:00:23,520
He said Anushka and brought
someone else. He covered her face.

891
01:00:23,607 --> 01:00:24,941
He showed her to me.

892
01:00:25,319 --> 01:00:29,761
Hry, only because my heart was stronger,
I am still alive. Otherwise.

893
01:00:30,592 --> 01:00:34,378
I would have been dead and buried.

894
01:00:35,514 --> 01:00:38,056
Sir. You are blaming him needlesly.

895
01:00:38,107 --> 01:00:40,399
Those coupple ghosts are doing all this.

896
01:00:40,458 --> 01:00:41,687
- Couple ghosts?
- Yeah.

897
01:00:41,985 --> 01:00:44,461
- How is it so?
- One is Male and another is female.

898
01:00:44,477 --> 01:00:47,045
We subdued the male ghost and
sent it back.

899
01:00:47,068 --> 01:00:49,334
He has gone to befriend the female ghost.

900
01:00:49,366 --> 01:00:53,333
Shut up. They are not horses to befriend.
Ghosts.

901
01:00:53,782 --> 01:00:55,973
You do not beleive me right?
I don't.

902
01:00:56,166 --> 01:01:00,444
See this. This photo is the proof that we
are friends with that ghost.

903
01:01:00,485 --> 01:01:02,142
- Where? Show me.
- Look.

904
01:01:02,508 --> 01:01:03,804
Yeah. Take a look.

905
01:01:04,277 --> 01:01:05,277
What?

906
01:01:08,362 --> 01:01:09,649
Anushka or Danushka.

907
01:01:09,849 --> 01:01:13,423
He looks like a matchstick, he needs
Laddu like Anushka. Nonsense.

908
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:16,903
Now I need to immediately take a leak.

909
01:01:28,475 --> 01:01:33,135
"In the oozing shades of dark,
behind the jasmine farms."

910
01:01:33,406 --> 01:01:36,791
"Meet me in the evening."

911
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:49,954
That means Sreenu is...

912
01:01:50,699 --> 01:01:53,220
Nethra! Nethra!

913
01:01:57,075 --> 01:01:58,075
Nethra...

914
01:02:01,074 --> 01:02:03,592
Nethra... Nethra!

915
01:02:18,145 --> 01:02:19,145
Nethra...

916
01:02:23,332 --> 01:02:24,332
Nethra...

917
01:02:35,239 --> 01:02:36,239
Nethra...

918
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:43,500
Nethra...

919
01:02:55,725 --> 01:02:56,725
Nethra...

920
01:02:59,168 --> 01:03:00,496
Nethra... What happened Nethra?

921
01:03:02,961 --> 01:03:03,961
Nethra...

922
01:03:04,285 --> 01:03:06,094
Why are you scared?
Tell me Nethra.

923
01:03:09,581 --> 01:03:13,184
Nethra... What happened Nethra?
Tell me.

924
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:49,724
To know who is she?

925
01:03:49,955 --> 01:03:51,715
What is her past,

926
01:03:51,832 --> 01:03:54,228
You need not read pages
and pages of books.

927
01:03:54,467 --> 01:03:56,334
You need not ask ten people.

928
01:03:57,104 --> 01:04:01,459
If you go to Rajahmundry and ask the
flowing Godavari, it will tell about her.

929
01:04:07,597 --> 01:04:09,939
You look vey interesting.

930
01:04:11,074 --> 01:04:16,581
You look like a freshly polished rice,
that is freshly out of the mill. Damn you.

931
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:19,449
But if I see the things you hve done,
Damn you.

932
01:04:19,817 --> 01:04:22,150
My eyes are turning red with blood.

933
01:04:24,007 --> 01:04:25,098
Please leave me sir.

934
01:04:25,122 --> 01:04:28,449
I have to look after my parents sir.
Please leave me sir, please.

935
01:04:28,991 --> 01:04:31,505
Haha. He is speaking English.

936
01:04:31,594 --> 01:04:32,594
Damn you.

937
01:04:33,384 --> 01:04:35,177
What does it mean? Huh?

938
01:04:35,657 --> 01:04:38,124
I am the only son of my parents sir.

939
01:04:38,718 --> 01:04:40,781
I have to take care of them sir.

940
01:04:40,816 --> 01:04:42,664
Please leave me sir.

941
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:44,171
Is that so?

942
01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:47,234
Look, if you are hungry,

943
01:04:47,901 --> 01:04:51,840
Come to my mill, take 4 KG rice,
cook and eat lunch. Nothing wrong in it.

944
01:04:52,361 --> 01:04:53,361
But...

945
01:04:53,492 --> 01:04:58,236
If you think you are of age and roam
around my daughter with rose in hand...

946
01:04:59,219 --> 01:05:02,419
You will trun into fodder in my mill,
damn you.

947
01:05:02,989 --> 01:05:06,786
If I don't want guys like him
behind my girl,

948
01:05:08,917 --> 01:05:12,839
We should grind him to pulp.
Hey, beat him black and blue.

949
01:05:13,193 --> 01:05:15,862
- Hit him.
- How dare you look at our madam.

950
01:05:15,925 --> 01:05:17,391
We will finish you up.

951
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:23,127
Hey, Why did you chant love,
love for this much? Damn you.

952
01:05:23,835 --> 01:05:26,723
Hey, take him and throw him in Godavari.

953
01:05:30,216 --> 01:05:34,000
Ho must be the man that
holds my daughter's hand?

954
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:40,666
He should be like the lord Shiva,
Who carries Ganga on his head.

955
01:05:41,778 --> 01:05:43,264
Our Suri is there.

956
01:05:43,355 --> 01:05:44,886
You state what is the bet.

957
01:05:45,093 --> 01:05:46,584
We will say how much is the bet.

958
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,147
Is he such a hot shot?

959
01:05:48,193 --> 01:05:51,128
Place a bet and see,
you will know.

960
01:05:51,472 --> 01:05:53,956
Move, Move, move.

961
01:05:54,026 --> 01:05:55,893
Betting Brothers are coming.

962
01:06:00,777 --> 01:06:03,482
- Oh my God! They are here.
- Hmm...

963
01:06:04,855 --> 01:06:05,997
What man?

964
01:06:06,036 --> 01:06:09,456
Are you placing a bet in Godavari district
without the knowledge of betting brothers?

965
01:06:09,504 --> 01:06:12,603
What is the bet and on whom?

966
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:14,740
Who else? On our Suri.

967
01:06:14,848 --> 01:06:19,264
Oh! Suri is it? We can bet whatever
amount on him.

968
01:06:21,415 --> 01:06:23,058
Our bet is 10,000.

969
01:06:25,205 --> 01:06:26,942
Telll us what the bet is about.

970
01:06:29,433 --> 01:06:32,022
As soon as I leave this marked fish
in the water,

971
01:06:32,108 --> 01:06:34,708
It will disappear faster than the air..

972
01:06:34,926 --> 01:06:37,659
He should search and bring the fish back.
That is the bet.

973
01:06:37,673 --> 01:06:39,204
We are ready, are you ready?

974
01:06:39,332 --> 01:06:40,732
Our guy is brn ready.

975
01:06:41,483 --> 01:06:44,816
But name that marked Fish as Nethra
and leave it.

976
01:06:45,612 --> 01:06:48,534
Why because,
the name is very close to our guy.

977
01:06:48,846 --> 01:06:52,133
What? If we tell the name Nethra,
will he do anything?

978
01:06:52,231 --> 01:06:54,235
Ask him to bring the fish. That's enough.

979
01:06:54,465 --> 01:06:55,953
Go! Nethra.

980
01:06:56,592 --> 01:07:01,596
Hey Abbi, you made a huge
mistake namng that fish Nethra.

981
01:07:01,944 --> 01:07:03,410
Keep your money ready.

982
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,024
Suri!

983
01:07:53,224 --> 01:07:55,160
You are done today. Pay up.

984
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:02,280
As soon as he heard Nethra name, he became
so agressive.

985
01:08:02,699 --> 01:08:04,611
Who is this Nethra?

986
01:08:33,947 --> 01:08:34,947
Look, Nethra,

987
01:08:36,047 --> 01:08:41,011
You are coming to temple and praying for
Your love to succeed.

988
01:08:41,181 --> 01:08:45,115
That god knows about your father.
He may fear him.

989
01:08:45,507 --> 01:08:47,040
How would he bless you?

990
01:08:49,118 --> 01:08:53,985
To be scared of my dad and stop blessing,
I am not asking to win a race.

991
01:08:54,169 --> 01:08:55,969
I am asking to win in Love.

992
01:08:56,112 --> 01:09:01,760
I have complete trust in my
love and that god.

993
01:09:02,026 --> 01:09:03,471
Everything will go well.

994
01:09:24,842 --> 01:09:26,427
You came home son?

995
01:09:26,656 --> 01:09:28,441
You must be very hungry.

996
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:30,977
What did you do to be so tired?

997
01:09:31,246 --> 01:09:32,980
Did you ask what did I do?

998
01:09:35,187 --> 01:09:38,021
If your grand son ome home
after day's hard work.

999
01:09:38,101 --> 01:09:39,901
You can't cook a good meal.

1000
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:42,292
But you know how to shout.
Sleep off.

1001
01:09:42,882 --> 01:09:44,130
I will, I will.

1002
01:09:44,784 --> 01:09:48,051
Do you think I am not aware of
your shenanigans?

1003
01:09:48,124 --> 01:09:50,324
I am Warning you again and again.

1004
01:09:50,427 --> 01:09:53,094
If you meet that Girl from the big house

1005
01:09:53,686 --> 01:09:55,257
or if I hear you say her name,

1006
01:09:57,198 --> 01:09:58,864
Its as good as I am dead.

1007
01:10:03,351 --> 01:10:04,460
It's not like that Granny.

1008
01:10:04,495 --> 01:10:06,095
She is a very good girl.

1009
01:10:06,964 --> 01:10:09,001
She will take good care of you and me.

1010
01:10:09,133 --> 01:10:12,095
To her, I mean the world.

1011
01:10:14,173 --> 01:10:16,183
Oh! Dumb fellow!

1012
01:10:17,582 --> 01:10:20,582
Poor Man's love will sacrifice
life in need.

1013
01:10:21,353 --> 01:10:25,419
But the rich ones love? It always
wants to take a life away.

1014
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:34,426
If something bad happens to you,

1015
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,760
This old lady cannot bare to see it.

1016
01:10:42,257 --> 01:10:44,768
Forget her. It's good for us.

1017
01:10:48,256 --> 01:10:50,611
Go. Go and sleep.

1018
01:11:21,095 --> 01:11:22,095
Hey, Suri.

1019
01:11:23,783 --> 01:11:27,495
At this time, in this dress,
We are going out.

1020
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:29,745
If some one sees us...

1021
01:11:30,265 --> 01:11:32,478
They will think we are thieves.

1022
01:11:32,962 --> 01:11:36,109
Hey,
that Venkateshwara Rao is a stubborn man.

1023
01:11:36,265 --> 01:11:41,546
He is a big goon. If we get caught,
I am telling you, we are dead.

1024
01:11:42,043 --> 01:11:45,522
This Gangaraju, escaped this
without coming.

1025
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:48,487
If that scared, why did you guys come?
Calm down and stay here.

1026
01:11:48,519 --> 01:11:50,585
I will go, give it to
Nethra and come back.

1027
01:11:55,351 --> 01:11:58,773
Because the servant liked the princess
at first sight,

1028
01:11:58,992 --> 01:12:02,460
He went into the fort during midnight.

1029
01:12:02,492 --> 01:12:07,056
Without being seen by the
guards of the princess,

1030
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:11,459
Our servant is trying to
get a look of the princess.

1031
01:12:12,151 --> 01:12:13,151
Madam.

1032
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:15,621
Let's finish the story tomorrow.

1033
01:12:17,606 --> 01:12:18,775
I am feeling sleepy.

1034
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,631
In ten minutes time,
along with my birthday,

1035
01:12:21,648 --> 01:12:23,356
Dad will also come back home.

1036
01:12:23,414 --> 01:12:24,998
Till then, I need your company.

1037
01:12:25,111 --> 01:12:27,285
What did I do to deserve this
in the midnight.

1038
01:12:27,659 --> 01:12:30,040
- Looks like daddy is back.
- Thank god!

1039
01:12:30,977 --> 01:12:32,791
Thank god, I am saved for the day.

1040
01:12:35,719 --> 01:12:38,680
Happy Birthday, dear.
Be happy like this, always.

1041
01:12:38,974 --> 01:12:41,090
What dad? Just the blessings?

1042
01:12:41,492 --> 01:12:43,850
- No gift for my birthday?
- Why not damn it?

1043
01:12:44,392 --> 01:12:48,771
I will give you a good guy as
husband to you, as birthday gift.

1044
01:12:48,835 --> 01:12:49,835
Yeah.

1045
01:12:50,793 --> 01:12:52,180
Here, take a look at the photo.

1046
01:12:53,090 --> 01:12:54,217
How is the groom?

1047
01:12:54,843 --> 01:12:57,399
Hundred crores property.
Only son.

1048
01:13:01,626 --> 01:13:03,713
If you like the guy, I am good too, dad.

1049
01:13:03,817 --> 01:13:05,416
My gem of a daughter.

1050
01:13:07,389 --> 01:13:10,672
She will never say no to my words.

1051
01:13:21,052 --> 01:13:22,678
I told you before hand itself.

1052
01:13:23,917 --> 01:13:25,917
All these rich girls are same.

1053
01:13:26,454 --> 01:13:27,859
Just to pass time,

1054
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:30,064
They speak to poor people like us.

1055
01:13:30,492 --> 01:13:32,958
But to marry, they seek out a.

1056
01:13:33,467 --> 01:13:34,467
Now see.

1057
01:13:35,025 --> 01:13:38,287
She will marry the one her dad showed.
And she will be happy.

1058
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:41,396
But you keep sulking about her and
become a drunk.

1059
01:13:41,595 --> 01:13:42,602
No man,

1060
01:13:42,704 --> 01:13:43,704
She is my life.

1061
01:13:44,106 --> 01:13:45,639
I have trust in Nethra.

1062
01:13:45,971 --> 01:13:47,327
She will never cheat me.

1063
01:13:49,361 --> 01:13:50,828
He will, never change.

1064
01:13:51,167 --> 01:13:54,421
Even when you know, What you held is not
gold but coal,

1065
01:13:54,567 --> 01:13:57,617
You are still saying you will think of it
as black gold.

1066
01:13:57,999 --> 01:13:59,331
What do we talk with him?

1067
01:13:59,504 --> 01:14:03,238
If she really likes you, ask her to marry
you tomorrow in Temple.

1068
01:14:04,466 --> 01:14:06,307
Then you will learn if it is
true love or not.

1069
01:14:06,788 --> 01:14:09,841
Yeah. Right. We can do as gangaraju
said. We will know.

1070
01:14:09,941 --> 01:14:13,119
I agree, if we do that, His doubt will
also clear.

1071
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:14,507
Yeah, Clarify that.

1072
01:14:19,314 --> 01:14:21,425
What Suri, today is my birthday right?

1073
01:14:21,449 --> 01:14:23,343
However, you won't bring me costly gift.

1074
01:14:23,616 --> 01:14:26,661
Atleast you didn't get the thought to call
and wish me at midnight?

1075
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:29,354
Last night I waited for your phone call.

1076
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:33,074
Why are you being silent
when I am talking so much.

1077
01:14:34,675 --> 01:14:35,795
What do you want me to talk?

1078
01:14:36,211 --> 01:14:38,667
On one hand, you said okay to
the alliance your dad brought.

1079
01:14:38,908 --> 01:14:42,984
On the other hand, you are
showing love on me. I am speechless.

1080
01:14:44,498 --> 01:14:45,986
It's not like that Suri.

1081
01:14:46,058 --> 01:14:49,109
I will not ask you if what
I saw last night is truth or false.

1082
01:14:49,589 --> 01:14:51,207
If you really love me,

1083
01:14:51,408 --> 01:14:55,027
keeping Godavari as our witness,
we will marry in temple tomorrow.

1084
01:14:57,671 --> 01:14:59,471
I am going with the
belief that you will come.

1085
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:21,129
What Suri?

1086
01:15:22,497 --> 01:15:24,131
Why are you looking so worried?

1087
01:15:25,116 --> 01:15:27,866
Are you sad because I
asked you to forget that girl?

1088
01:15:28,965 --> 01:15:31,117
Whatever I told, I told for your good.

1089
01:15:32,073 --> 01:15:33,344
Not about that.

1090
01:15:33,546 --> 01:15:36,679
As a grand son,
I understand what you said.

1091
01:15:36,815 --> 01:15:39,373
But, My heart won't understand that.

1092
01:15:39,521 --> 01:15:43,194
I am unable to forget her.

1093
01:15:51,233 --> 01:15:52,328
Come with me.

1094
01:16:00,208 --> 01:16:01,342
Hey, pour it all.

1095
01:16:03,378 --> 01:16:04,378
Pour it all.

1096
01:16:29,713 --> 01:16:31,924
What Koti? Is the job done?

1097
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,093
Hey Venkatachalam.

1098
01:16:33,301 --> 01:16:35,348
- Huh?
- After knowing that I am marrying

1099
01:16:35,391 --> 01:16:39,289
your daughter in Temple,
I thought you would do such a thing.

1100
01:16:39,544 --> 01:16:40,750
I am forgiving you this time.

1101
01:16:41,112 --> 01:16:45,872
If you do such a thing again,
I will drive a knife through your heart.

1102
01:16:55,942 --> 01:16:57,100
Whatever happened,

1103
01:16:57,115 --> 01:17:00,400
Because of our Gangaraju,
Suri is finally marrying.

1104
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:02,897
By the way,
will Nethra come to the said place?

1105
01:17:03,262 --> 01:17:04,436
Why wouldn't she come?

1106
01:17:04,505 --> 01:17:06,173
She loves Suri
more than her life.

1107
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:10,718
You will see, She will be there
before us. Dressed like a bride.

1108
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:12,931
She will be waiting to marry our guy.

1109
01:17:13,184 --> 01:17:15,317
Yeah. There is no doubt in that.

1110
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:30,230
What is this Suri?

1111
01:17:32,054 --> 01:17:33,101
Is what I heard true?

1112
01:17:33,852 --> 01:17:37,247
That you are marrying
the Venkatachalam's Daughter.

1113
01:17:38,397 --> 01:17:41,032
He will maime those
who looks at his daughter.

1114
01:17:41,409 --> 01:17:45,417
How did he agree to wash your feet?
I don't understand.

1115
01:17:45,521 --> 01:17:46,647
Leave that subject.

1116
01:17:46,862 --> 01:17:48,729
How did you hear about this?

1117
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:52,498
Did my father in law
send people here to finish me?

1118
01:17:53,482 --> 01:17:54,783
Nothing like that my boy.

1119
01:17:55,112 --> 01:17:56,488
Your granny came a while ago.

1120
01:17:56,544 --> 01:17:59,708
She performed an Archana
to bless this marriage with success.

1121
01:18:00,228 --> 01:18:02,494
Oh my Granny! You are a sweet one.

1122
01:18:03,508 --> 01:18:06,386
I was always worried that
You aren't here to see the marriage.

1123
01:18:06,431 --> 01:18:07,562
Now I don't have that worry.

1124
01:18:07,597 --> 01:18:10,589
Priest, I will go and
get my granny right away.

1125
01:18:10,816 --> 01:18:13,069
If some one comes by
that time, ask them to wait for me.

1126
01:18:13,096 --> 01:18:15,344
- You hold this please.
- Bless you.

1127
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:32,680
Oh my god!

1128
01:18:38,025 --> 01:18:39,161
Oh my god!

1129
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:44,617
Hey Ganga, Ganga, What happened?

1130
01:18:45,879 --> 01:18:47,515
Hey Ganga, What happened?

1131
01:18:47,968 --> 01:18:49,101
What is all this?

1132
01:18:49,173 --> 01:18:51,119
In the hands of a rich man's daughter,

1133
01:18:52,048 --> 01:18:53,885
Poor man's love is lost.

1134
01:18:54,798 --> 01:18:56,580
Nethra cheated you.

1135
01:18:57,386 --> 01:18:58,562
All of our people are...

1136
01:18:59,236 --> 01:19:02,384
brutally killed by her father.

1137
01:19:03,999 --> 01:19:06,023
Where are those father and Daughter?

1138
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:09,310
Venkatachalam!

1139
01:19:10,307 --> 01:19:11,307
Venkatachalam!

1140
01:19:12,506 --> 01:19:13,624
Hey, Venkatachalam!

1141
01:19:14,373 --> 01:19:15,906
Where the hell are you?

1142
01:19:16,201 --> 01:19:17,211
Where is your Dad?

1143
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:18,853
Is he hiding inside?

1144
01:19:19,161 --> 01:19:21,988
Where ever he is,
I will drag him out and cut his throat.

1145
01:19:22,016 --> 01:19:23,016
Call him out!

1146
01:19:23,508 --> 01:19:25,458
Speak respectfully.

1147
01:19:25,514 --> 01:19:27,180
What wrong did my dad do?

1148
01:19:27,324 --> 01:19:32,101
He just wanted his daughter to be happy
and rich instead of poor and sad.

1149
01:19:32,178 --> 01:19:33,178
Is that sad?

1150
01:19:33,909 --> 01:19:36,493
It's my mistake that
I loved a cheap fellow like you.

1151
01:19:36,788 --> 01:19:37,789
If you want, kill me.

1152
01:19:37,829 --> 01:19:39,496
Yes, I am a cheap fellow.

1153
01:19:40,027 --> 01:19:41,860
I am living on soup. Yes.

1154
01:19:42,599 --> 01:19:44,588
But, you shouldn't
say these words now.

1155
01:19:44,756 --> 01:19:47,738
Before you spoke to me or
before you fell in love with me.

1156
01:19:47,789 --> 01:19:49,026
You were silent then.

1157
01:19:49,109 --> 01:19:52,413
Just because you have
a new, rich fiance, will you cheat me?

1158
01:19:52,667 --> 01:19:55,196
Will you be silent if
a man does a same thing?

1159
01:19:55,595 --> 01:19:57,995
Won't you protest and ruin his life?

1160
01:19:59,237 --> 01:20:01,704
See, if I have
hurt you, I am sorry.

1161
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:05,193
But, I can't marry an
uneducated man like you.

1162
01:20:05,244 --> 01:20:06,244
Get Lost.

1163
01:20:07,623 --> 01:20:09,266
What will you share with us?

1164
01:20:09,441 --> 01:20:11,124
I am even disgusted to look at you.

1165
01:20:12,598 --> 01:20:13,741
Granny told long back.

1166
01:20:14,382 --> 01:20:17,048
That rich kid's love is like a old food.

1167
01:20:17,489 --> 01:20:20,089
It will be spoiled and won't last long.

1168
01:20:21,064 --> 01:20:22,464
But, I didn't listen.

1169
01:20:24,023 --> 01:20:25,556
I lost my best friends.

1170
01:20:26,292 --> 01:20:28,355
I hurt my loving granny.

1171
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:33,305
What I need now is not
your disgusting love.

1172
01:20:33,923 --> 01:20:35,457
I want your Dad's life.

1173
01:20:35,838 --> 01:20:37,705
He is hiding from me, right?

1174
01:20:37,723 --> 01:20:40,190
O get him out, I need to get you out.

1175
01:20:40,403 --> 01:20:43,228
- Come on.
- Suri, Leave me Please.

1176
01:20:52,816 --> 01:20:54,002
What are you looking at?

1177
01:20:54,098 --> 01:20:55,901
He said he will kill my father.

1178
01:20:56,164 --> 01:20:59,148
But, are you thinking,
why I am digging the grave?

1179
01:20:59,191 --> 01:21:00,979
This is not for your dad.

1180
01:21:01,197 --> 01:21:02,577
This is for you.

1181
01:21:03,331 --> 01:21:05,902
What? Are you thinking that
I loved you once very dearly,

1182
01:21:06,067 --> 01:21:07,757
but, now trying to kill you?

1183
01:21:09,449 --> 01:21:12,405
If we love girls like you,
this iswhat is we have left to do.

1184
01:21:12,466 --> 01:21:13,966
You are like chameleons.

1185
01:21:14,231 --> 01:21:18,795
They change colors, you girls change
lovers for money, lust and love.

1186
01:21:21,343 --> 01:21:25,462
If we love you madly, We look
like crazy fellows to you. Right?

1187
01:21:26,218 --> 01:21:27,618
It is not your fault.

1188
01:21:28,134 --> 01:21:29,134
It's ours.

1189
01:21:29,466 --> 01:21:33,416
We will be behind you like dogs,
giving whatever you ask for,

1190
01:21:34,928 --> 01:21:36,240
That is the mistake we make.

1191
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:38,559
Once I was your courage and strength.

1192
01:21:38,907 --> 01:21:41,383
But now, I am nothing to you.

1193
01:21:45,376 --> 01:21:47,543
Why do you spoil the lives of our kind?

1194
01:21:49,468 --> 01:21:50,492
Not all this.

1195
01:21:51,152 --> 01:21:54,419
Girls like you, shouldn't
even be alive on earth.

1196
01:21:55,788 --> 01:21:58,121
That is why I am going to kill you.

1197
01:21:59,228 --> 01:22:01,494
Remember one thing before you die.

1198
01:22:02,089 --> 01:22:05,289
Everything is this
world is being adulterated.

1199
01:22:06,261 --> 01:22:10,999
If you try to adulterate love,
No lover will remain silent.

1200
01:22:14,973 --> 01:22:18,326
He will take a sword into
his hand. He will take revenge.

1201
01:22:18,393 --> 01:22:19,411
Suri...

1202
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:23,126
Suri...

1203
01:22:24,262 --> 01:22:25,262
Suri...

1204
01:22:28,066 --> 01:22:29,066
Suri...

1205
01:22:45,352 --> 01:22:48,342
What man? Is he done being a hero?

1206
01:22:55,874 --> 01:22:56,874
Damn you.

1207
01:22:57,865 --> 01:22:58,865
Hey.

1208
01:22:59,219 --> 01:23:02,019
Poor should fight for a morsel of food,

1209
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:06,172
If they fight for Love or revenge,
They would lose life like this.

1210
01:23:08,104 --> 01:23:12,765
God blesses rich
people like us with long livespans.

1211
01:23:13,065 --> 01:23:14,509
Do you know why?

1212
01:23:15,249 --> 01:23:18,591
Because he is
afraid that we have money.

1213
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:22,378
People like you,

1214
01:23:22,693 --> 01:23:23,875
What ever we do,

1215
01:23:24,231 --> 01:23:26,831
Cannot do anything to oppose. Damn you.

1216
01:23:27,341 --> 01:23:29,777
Look, forget all these.

1217
01:23:30,297 --> 01:23:31,297
And die.

1218
01:23:34,459 --> 01:23:35,925
Die, you son of a gun.

1219
01:23:36,798 --> 01:23:37,798
Die.

1220
01:23:41,807 --> 01:23:42,807
Son of a...

1221
01:24:09,597 --> 01:24:15,575
"Your smile made a magic."

1222
01:24:25,414 --> 01:24:30,975
"Your eyes cheated."

1223
01:24:38,129 --> 01:24:40,428
"It bit me."

1224
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:43,980
"It wounded my heart."

1225
01:24:44,423 --> 01:24:47,227
"It cheated me."

1226
01:24:47,293 --> 01:24:50,986
"It threw me on the road."

1227
01:24:51,168 --> 01:24:57,072
"It said love is hell
and laughed sarcastically."

1228
01:24:57,829 --> 01:25:03,809
"Your smile made a magic."

1229
01:25:06,954 --> 01:25:12,872
"Your eyes cheated."

1230
01:25:58,306 --> 01:26:04,220
"Sky and land, may become one."

1231
01:26:04,629 --> 01:26:10,438
"Water and fire, may become partners."

1232
01:26:11,058 --> 01:26:16,854
"I once believed happilly our
relationship was unbreakable."

1233
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:23,137
"But I have come to know that
You have put me in deep sorrow."

1234
01:26:23,765 --> 01:26:29,634
"What do I say now, my love?
What is your address?"

1235
01:26:30,181 --> 01:26:36,086
"What is the recourse for
this endless sorrow?"

1236
01:26:36,602 --> 01:26:42,482
"Your smile did the magic."

1237
01:27:18,331 --> 01:27:24,196
"I believed you and me to be one."

1238
01:27:24,487 --> 01:27:30,480
"I thought this to be self less love."

1239
01:27:31,025 --> 01:27:36,889
"I believed this
to be a trustworthy story."

1240
01:27:37,412 --> 01:27:43,354
"But it became the force
to drown me in mid sea."

1241
01:27:44,048 --> 01:27:49,722
"What do I tell you love?
My unforgettable memory."

1242
01:27:50,369 --> 01:27:56,324
"You will be followed by this
endless life forever."

1243
01:27:56,638 --> 01:28:02,251
"Your eyes cheated me."

1244
01:28:06,462 --> 01:28:12,400
"Your eyes cheated me."

1245
01:28:47,996 --> 01:28:48,996
Doctor.

1246
01:28:49,406 --> 01:28:50,406
How is she?

1247
01:28:50,829 --> 01:28:51,987
She has eaten poison.

1248
01:28:53,065 --> 01:28:54,732
Now she is out of Danger.

1249
01:28:54,934 --> 01:28:57,564
If you had delayed,
she would have been lost forever.

1250
01:28:57,833 --> 01:29:01,950
- So, take care of her at least now.
- Sir, emergency case.

1251
01:29:07,942 --> 01:29:10,179
As soon as I threatened
to kill her loved one,

1252
01:29:10,228 --> 01:29:12,028
She agreed to the marriage.

1253
01:29:12,454 --> 01:29:14,390
I thought it's
because she loved me.

1254
01:29:16,287 --> 01:29:20,369
But, never thought she loved
him so much. Damn you.

1255
01:29:25,189 --> 01:29:27,858
Come Nethra, quick.
Sit quickly now.

1256
01:29:31,029 --> 01:29:34,068
Finally.
We were scared you wouldn't come.

1257
01:29:34,371 --> 01:29:38,644
Why worry? Any girl would be there
first to be wedded to a guy she loves.

1258
01:29:38,948 --> 01:29:41,280
Now, no one can stop our
Suri and Nethra's marriage.

1259
01:29:52,748 --> 01:29:55,025
Why did you come here?
Did we get lost?

1260
01:29:55,954 --> 01:29:58,993
I am not new here to get lost.

1261
01:30:00,991 --> 01:30:02,482
I have decided to do wrong,

1262
01:30:02,829 --> 01:30:05,884
- Hence I brought you here.
- What are you talking about?

1263
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:07,330
Hey, Baby.

1264
01:30:10,951 --> 01:30:14,951
Do you know why I was silent,
Even when I knew your ideas? Damn you.

1265
01:30:18,894 --> 01:30:21,113
Because I wanted to
show you, what kind of person I am.

1266
01:30:21,358 --> 01:30:26,821
Look, It didn't take as much time to
Bring you back as you took to elope.

1267
01:30:27,603 --> 01:30:28,908
You did a mistake dad.

1268
01:30:29,262 --> 01:30:33,101
If you had left me alone,
I would have married Suri.

1269
01:30:33,481 --> 01:30:36,156
But, this time,
I'll get pregnant with Suri's baby.

1270
01:30:36,522 --> 01:30:38,557
Then, you would have
get us married for honour.

1271
01:30:39,154 --> 01:30:43,677
Love itself can't kill he love.
What can you do?

1272
01:30:43,817 --> 01:30:48,271
That is true, I can't kill love,
But I can kill the lover.

1273
01:30:52,283 --> 01:30:56,919
If a father says such words,
Any daughter won't believe them.

1274
01:30:57,333 --> 01:31:01,826
But you will believe it once you see this.

1275
01:31:02,698 --> 01:31:03,698
Ramu...

1276
01:31:04,914 --> 01:31:06,996
Raju... Raju...

1277
01:31:07,697 --> 01:31:08,697
Ramu...

1278
01:31:10,138 --> 01:31:11,183
Raju...

1279
01:31:14,955 --> 01:31:15,955
Dad...

1280
01:31:16,502 --> 01:31:17,502
Raju...

1281
01:31:22,622 --> 01:31:23,622
Ramu...

1282
01:31:29,652 --> 01:31:31,802
Done with it. Damn you.

1283
01:31:33,801 --> 01:31:36,301
Not yet...

1284
01:31:47,703 --> 01:31:51,993
He killed my love and my lover,
I never wanted to see his face.

1285
01:31:52,025 --> 01:31:53,247
Hence, came to Vizag.

1286
01:31:53,304 --> 01:31:56,461
I was startled to see
you who look like Suri.

1287
01:31:56,491 --> 01:31:57,491
I felt happy.

1288
01:31:57,846 --> 01:32:01,634
But, Suri's soul is haunting me
to punish me for no mistake of mine.

1289
01:32:02,258 --> 01:32:06,050
That is why, I asked him
not to torture me but kill me at once.

1290
01:32:06,263 --> 01:32:07,349
This is not your fault.

1291
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:11,330
It's your father's fault, who
valued money more than his daughter.

1292
01:32:11,780 --> 01:32:15,640
It is the fault of Gangaraju,
who sold his friends for money.

1293
01:32:15,743 --> 01:32:18,351
He should be punished.
And he will be punished for sure.

1294
01:32:23,287 --> 01:32:24,287
Come come.

1295
01:32:24,574 --> 01:32:25,849
Let's go quickly. What happened?

1296
01:32:25,871 --> 01:32:28,305
Why are you all leaving?
Where are you guys going?

1297
01:32:28,441 --> 01:32:29,441
Where else? To Vizag.

1298
01:32:29,856 --> 01:32:33,102
We are afraid that we may see
some more deaths if we stay here anymore.

1299
01:32:33,265 --> 01:32:34,265
- Lets go.
- So...

1300
01:32:34,378 --> 01:32:36,906
Do you think, the ghost would
leave you alone if you leave to Vizag?

1301
01:32:36,930 --> 01:32:37,930
What then?

1302
01:32:38,044 --> 01:32:41,594
Did it fall in love with me?
Or did I marry it that it sticks to me?

1303
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:42,973
Get lost.

1304
01:32:44,199 --> 01:32:48,911
It's truetoo. That ghost
loves you whole heartedly.

1305
01:32:48,914 --> 01:32:49,981
Enough. Shut up.

1306
01:32:50,549 --> 01:32:51,867
Why would the ghost love me?

1307
01:32:51,876 --> 01:32:55,844
Ever since I am wearing pants,
I myself have gone behind girls.

1308
01:32:55,947 --> 01:32:57,814
No girl ever came behind me.

1309
01:32:58,301 --> 01:33:02,593
To believe that a ghost
loves me, I am not Sampoornesh babu.

1310
01:33:03,896 --> 01:33:05,173
I am Rambabu.

1311
01:33:05,321 --> 01:33:07,287
What ever babu you are,
I am telling the truth.

1312
01:33:07,493 --> 01:33:10,407
She couldn't stand
Revathi looking at you lustily.

1313
01:33:10,471 --> 01:33:12,247
That's why she
killed her so violently.

1314
01:33:12,314 --> 01:33:14,317
After so much, if you
Still go to Vizag now,

1315
01:33:14,373 --> 01:33:17,423
She will think it's waste for you
to live if you cannot understand her love.

1316
01:33:17,455 --> 01:33:18,989
She will also kill you.

1317
01:33:19,393 --> 01:33:20,631
It's up to you then.

1318
01:33:20,950 --> 01:33:23,012
How do you know
that ghost will do it that way?

1319
01:33:23,065 --> 01:33:26,142
Ganesh, didn't you tell them
about, how close we are to ghosts?

1320
01:33:26,246 --> 01:33:30,527
I did. I even showed
my ghost selfie to him.

1321
01:33:30,653 --> 01:33:32,528
Sir, did I not show the pic to you?

1322
01:33:33,936 --> 01:33:34,936
Yes, he did.

1323
01:33:35,930 --> 01:33:37,694
Sreenu, what do you suggest we do now?

1324
01:33:37,747 --> 01:33:41,510
Nothing. I will take care
of everything. You first go inside.

1325
01:33:41,699 --> 01:33:43,432
I will go. Just a minute.

1326
01:33:43,978 --> 01:33:46,894
The cops were here. They asked
you to go to station once you come.

1327
01:33:46,934 --> 01:33:48,918
- Your wish if you want to go.
- Sure. I will go.

1328
01:33:54,607 --> 01:33:55,607
Hello.

1329
01:34:12,298 --> 01:34:15,047
When she left her place and people,

1330
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:19,396
I thought she was going
out of anger That we killer her lover.

1331
01:34:20,458 --> 01:34:23,991
But, I didn't think it is
to be with him. Damn you.

1332
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:26,290
That Suri is not dead.

1333
01:34:27,766 --> 01:34:32,300
But the SI just called and said he is
safe and sound in Araku, with my daughter.

1334
01:34:32,605 --> 01:34:34,471
We ourself buried that Suri.

1335
01:34:34,501 --> 01:34:37,034
There is no chance of him coming back.

1336
01:34:41,511 --> 01:34:45,740
A rich man may not take
anything with him, when he dies.

1337
01:34:47,615 --> 01:34:49,215
But when the Lover died?

1338
01:34:50,632 --> 01:34:54,477
That love will come back from death
along with the life. Damn you.

1339
01:34:56,232 --> 01:34:59,120
If we dig the buried one,
the truth shall show itself.

1340
01:34:59,928 --> 01:35:01,262
Call that Gangaraju.

1341
01:35:05,345 --> 01:35:07,212
How can a dead man come out?

1342
01:35:07,829 --> 01:35:10,147
He is not a normal guy,
He is my friend.

1343
01:35:10,451 --> 01:35:13,358
He will not break the promise.
He will not come out alive again.

1344
01:35:13,802 --> 01:35:16,982
The SI must have confused
Somebody else with him.

1345
01:35:17,065 --> 01:35:18,328
It's not that. Damn you.

1346
01:35:18,579 --> 01:35:23,021
Look, We called you here to
dig up the dead man's grave.

1347
01:35:23,543 --> 01:35:24,943
Not for your free advises.

1348
01:35:25,153 --> 01:35:26,153
Hey, Dig here.

1349
01:35:43,352 --> 01:35:44,352
Did you see?

1350
01:35:44,599 --> 01:35:47,599
That measurements,
This is our Suri himself.

1351
01:35:48,179 --> 01:35:50,398
You unnecessarily
doubted a dead man.

1352
01:35:54,185 --> 01:35:59,497
See sir, He is our Suri.
I was the first person to hit him.

1353
01:36:00,271 --> 01:36:02,042
Then who is it there? Damn you.

1354
01:36:02,541 --> 01:36:05,340
No use,
lets go there immediately. Lets go.

1355
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:07,470
You guys go.

1356
01:36:08,992 --> 01:36:11,392
It's been a long time since I saw him.

1357
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:13,335
I am not able to stop crying.

1358
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:17,820
He was so good when he was alive.

1359
01:36:18,733 --> 01:36:20,666
You killed a tree height man.

1360
01:36:21,490 --> 01:36:24,751
Now, you are killing me
asking if he is really dead or not.

1361
01:36:27,255 --> 01:36:28,988
I will stay here sometime.

1362
01:36:30,552 --> 01:36:31,670
I am not in a good mood.

1363
01:36:32,381 --> 01:36:33,381
You guys go.

1364
01:36:34,829 --> 01:36:36,906
Hey, lets go. Now!

1365
01:36:45,197 --> 01:36:46,524
Hey Suri.

1366
01:36:48,655 --> 01:36:52,455
They say confessions will
reduce the burden of the sins.

1367
01:36:53,774 --> 01:36:59,014
That's why, I want to
confess to all my sins here now.

1368
01:36:59,726 --> 01:37:00,726
Nethra...

1369
01:37:03,352 --> 01:37:07,708
Was not lovely only for you,
even I had feelings for her.

1370
01:37:08,726 --> 01:37:09,726
But for Nethra,

1371
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:12,044
She liked you.

1372
01:37:17,105 --> 01:37:19,242
I wanted to get hold of her some how.

1373
01:37:20,381 --> 01:37:23,754
I tried to separate you guys many times.

1374
01:37:28,657 --> 01:37:29,657
Didn't happen.

1375
01:37:30,572 --> 01:37:34,207
That's why, I sided with her dad.

1376
01:37:35,549 --> 01:37:36,749
I moved you aside.

1377
01:37:38,802 --> 01:37:42,135
But, I am not
able to satiate My thirst for her.

1378
01:37:43,577 --> 01:37:44,577
She is so hot.

1379
01:37:46,539 --> 01:37:48,073
She is sharp as a star.

1380
01:37:49,707 --> 01:37:51,619
I will never leave her.

1381
01:38:02,026 --> 01:38:03,483
What else man?

1382
01:38:03,823 --> 01:38:05,792
Are all our friends fine up there?

1383
01:38:07,903 --> 01:38:09,236
Tell them I said hi.

1384
01:38:12,658 --> 01:38:13,740
I will take your leave.

1385
01:39:02,167 --> 01:39:03,458
That means Suri...

1386
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:09,062
He is killing the girls
who are cheating on their men.

1387
01:39:55,927 --> 01:39:57,459
Hey... Stop.

1388
01:39:57,489 --> 01:39:58,831
Don't move.

1389
01:40:00,564 --> 01:40:01,898
Leave me.

1390
01:40:03,140 --> 01:40:04,735
Leave me.

1391
01:40:06,037 --> 01:40:07,037
Suri...

1392
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:10,613
I spoke that way
to save your life. Please leave me.

1393
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:13,572
It's truth. Trust me please.

1394
01:40:13,706 --> 01:40:15,549
Leave me alone. Please.

1395
01:40:21,676 --> 01:40:23,409
Hey, who the hell are you?

1396
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:25,780
Hey, hey...

1397
01:40:28,710 --> 01:40:29,710
Oh my god!

1398
01:40:30,393 --> 01:40:31,878
I got caught.

1399
01:40:32,302 --> 01:40:33,550
I should run away.

1400
01:40:33,653 --> 01:40:37,170
Mom, Dad. He may kill me.

1401
01:41:00,255 --> 01:41:01,308
What happened?

1402
01:41:01,583 --> 01:41:03,358
We got the dead body of Talupulu.

1403
01:41:03,754 --> 01:41:06,021
The same Talupulu that you killed.

1404
01:41:06,745 --> 01:41:07,994
Why would I kill Talupulu?

1405
01:41:08,072 --> 01:41:10,366
What? What did you say?

1406
01:41:11,830 --> 01:41:12,830
Tell me now?

1407
01:41:13,314 --> 01:41:15,047
Why would I kill Talupulu?

1408
01:41:15,162 --> 01:41:19,228
Oh! Then who killed?
Do you think ghost killed him as well?

1409
01:41:19,454 --> 01:41:20,454
Police? Here?

1410
01:41:20,818 --> 01:41:22,717
I don't know all that,
Lets go to station first.

1411
01:41:22,768 --> 01:41:24,168
Sir, Sir... one minute.

1412
01:41:24,263 --> 01:41:27,989
- Ganesh, Where is Nethra?
- Her father took her.

1413
01:41:28,012 --> 01:41:29,844
Oh! Is this another twist?

1414
01:41:30,149 --> 01:41:32,829
What did you say?
Did her father took Nethra away?

1415
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:35,622
Don't tell me stories,
Let's go to police station.

1416
01:41:35,647 --> 01:41:36,948
I don't know anything, sir.

1417
01:41:41,674 --> 01:41:46,398
Finally we murdered a guy
and trapped Sreenu into it.

1418
01:41:47,252 --> 01:41:48,898
Very nice. Damn you.

1419
01:41:51,189 --> 01:41:53,128
Isn't it nice?
It will be nice for you.

1420
01:41:53,625 --> 01:41:56,079
I am afraid, what that ghost
Will do to me for filing case.

1421
01:41:56,164 --> 01:41:58,313
This sounds ridiculous.

1422
01:41:58,788 --> 01:42:03,091
If you do me a favour,
Why would it hurt you? Damn you.

1423
01:42:03,463 --> 01:42:05,063
Why because he is Suri..

1424
01:42:20,479 --> 01:42:22,239
Is whatever I heard true?

1425
01:42:22,789 --> 01:42:25,256
The say Suri has become a ghost?

1426
01:42:27,596 --> 01:42:30,171
In my childhood,
when I wouldn't have dinner,

1427
01:42:30,638 --> 01:42:33,689
My mom used to say,
'ghost will come.' to feed me.

1428
01:42:34,411 --> 01:42:36,011
Now, you are not eating.

1429
01:42:36,939 --> 01:42:39,110
I won't say ghost will come, like my mom.

1430
01:42:39,809 --> 01:42:43,474
Why because, I am the biggest ghost.

1431
01:42:44,813 --> 01:42:48,025
Take it. Eat it respectfully.

1432
01:42:49,092 --> 01:42:51,430
Why are you
forcing me to eat again and again?

1433
01:42:51,744 --> 01:42:55,207
I am talking to him right?
Can't you see him next to me?

1434
01:42:57,665 --> 01:42:59,331
I am talking about you.

1435
01:42:59,382 --> 01:43:00,515
One minute, Suri.

1436
01:43:01,806 --> 01:43:03,357
I will make him understand.

1437
01:43:04,265 --> 01:43:05,998
Don't get serious. Please.

1438
01:43:08,722 --> 01:43:10,402
He says, he will kill you now.

1439
01:43:10,442 --> 01:43:11,581
But, I am stopping him.

1440
01:43:11,993 --> 01:43:15,527
Agree to your sins and
bring Sreenu out of jail.

1441
01:43:15,551 --> 01:43:17,172
Atleast you will be alive in the jail.

1442
01:43:17,222 --> 01:43:21,628
What? I am considering you
as my daughter, but you are threatning me.

1443
01:43:21,971 --> 01:43:23,037
I will kill you.

1444
01:43:37,183 --> 01:43:38,183
What man?

1445
01:43:38,938 --> 01:43:41,404
Are you sweating cause you saw death?

1446
01:43:42,361 --> 01:43:45,161
My anger won't subside if I kill you once.

1447
01:43:46,589 --> 01:43:50,189
You should live in fear,
every second before you die.

1448
01:43:51,559 --> 01:43:53,434
Not much time left to die.

1449
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:56,900
Finish all your sins before that.

1450
01:43:59,858 --> 01:44:01,755
Why did you leave that Sreenu like that?

1451
01:44:02,578 --> 01:44:04,524
Do you know
he is in love with your daughter?

1452
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:12,320
I know about his love
only because you told me. Damn you.

1453
01:44:13,555 --> 01:44:17,555
But my daughter also loves him.
I know that from her words.

1454
01:44:18,086 --> 01:44:21,524
Yet, the real
problem now is the dead Suri.

1455
01:44:22,060 --> 01:44:25,594
Unless we move him aside,
I cannot do anything else.

1456
01:44:26,344 --> 01:44:30,520
What did you say? Doesn't matter.
I heard something approximately.

1457
01:44:30,949 --> 01:44:34,863
You don't worry,
There is man who can handle this.

1458
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:37,863
If we meet him,
this will be solved. Damn you.

1459
01:44:40,462 --> 01:44:43,597
Om...

1460
01:44:44,337 --> 01:44:46,610
Hreem...

1461
01:44:47,806 --> 01:44:50,150
Kreem...

1462
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:53,600
Take the offering.

1463
01:44:58,272 --> 01:45:04,074
He is burning to kill you
violently, cause you killed him.

1464
01:45:05,208 --> 01:45:07,444
It is not easy to subdue it.

1465
01:45:08,092 --> 01:45:09,678
But, I will try.

1466
01:45:10,262 --> 01:45:12,260
I will use the soul which will help you,

1467
01:45:12,842 --> 01:45:14,442
I will finish his story.

1468
01:45:17,146 --> 01:45:18,891
Who is the soul that helps us?

1469
01:45:19,241 --> 01:45:21,696
The soul of Revathi,
who was killed by him,

1470
01:45:22,151 --> 01:45:27,178
is seething to take
revenge on him. She is our weapon.

1471
01:45:34,655 --> 01:45:37,198
Who ever wears this,

1472
01:45:38,173 --> 01:45:40,236
Revathi's soul will be on them.

1473
01:45:41,507 --> 01:45:44,640
You can use this
against your enemies as well.

1474
01:46:08,484 --> 01:46:10,247
You called me to talk about something?

1475
01:46:10,616 --> 01:46:11,816
What is it Nethra?

1476
01:46:13,976 --> 01:46:17,376
You were eager to
listen some words from my mouth.

1477
01:46:17,426 --> 01:46:19,280
I called you to speak those words now.

1478
01:46:20,982 --> 01:46:21,982
I love you.

1479
01:46:30,131 --> 01:46:31,964
Why are you silent?

1480
01:46:36,723 --> 01:46:39,176
I thought you will
jump with joy, As soon as you heard it.

1481
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:41,844
Nethra, actually...

1482
01:47:29,781 --> 01:47:32,133
Dude, Dude, Hey, Sreenu...

1483
01:47:33,838 --> 01:47:35,988
Hey Dude, What happened?

1484
01:47:37,072 --> 01:47:38,151
How did this happen?

1485
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:05,800
Hey dude,

1486
01:48:06,686 --> 01:48:09,620
Why is she
playing with us in forest? Shit.

1487
01:48:13,969 --> 01:48:15,336
Hey, Sreenu, hey.

1488
01:48:20,687 --> 01:48:23,274
I am here. Nothing will happen to you.

1489
01:49:22,213 --> 01:49:23,213
Hey, Sreenu.

1490
01:49:27,488 --> 01:49:29,088
Hey Sreenu, How are you?

1491
01:49:30,463 --> 01:49:33,263
You should have been happy in the station.

1492
01:49:34,234 --> 01:49:35,481
Why do you need all these?

1493
01:49:35,581 --> 01:49:38,477
He came out with
recommendation from my daughter.

1494
01:49:38,761 --> 01:49:40,008
What happened. Damn you.

1495
01:49:40,995 --> 01:49:42,150
That is why,

1496
01:49:42,175 --> 01:49:45,509
When elders say Something, you should
believe it for your own good. Damn you.

1497
01:49:49,395 --> 01:49:51,585
- Finish them off.
- Hold on.

1498
01:49:52,594 --> 01:49:55,394
I will kill these fools with my own hands.

1499
01:50:36,299 --> 01:50:37,299
Hey.

1500
01:52:17,966 --> 01:52:18,966
Sreenu,

1501
01:52:20,711 --> 01:52:21,756
Sreenu.

1502
01:52:30,075 --> 01:52:31,196
Sreenu.

1503
01:52:32,157 --> 01:52:33,230
Sreenu.

1504
01:52:35,193 --> 01:52:36,193
Sreenu!
