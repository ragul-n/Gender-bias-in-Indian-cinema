1
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,458
-You may leave.
-Okay, sir.

2
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,583
I think they belong to Vagaiyara's clan.

3
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,166
Yes! They aren't getting caught.

4
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
-Where are they?
-They are at the festival.

5
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,416
Brother, nobody was home.

6
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,583
All of them are at the festival.

7
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,083
Abduct the entire family.

8
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:57,625
Hey! Drive fast.

9
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,166
-Who are you all?
-What do you want?

10
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:38,708
What did you do?

11
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,250
<i>Without even knowing the problem,</i>

12
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,291
<i>they have decided that</i>
<i>I am responsible for it.</i>

13
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,416
<i>That's not their fault.</i>

14
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,708
It's because that's how
I have been since childhood.

15
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,833
Your brother studies in
the same school as well.

16
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,208
But he is a sober one.

17
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,791
Why are you like this?

18
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:09,000
You will write "Henceforth,
I won't fight with anyone"

19
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,666
in your notebook 1000 times
and come to school tomorrow.

20
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,583
Understood? You may leave now.

21
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,125
-Does it hurt?
-Not at all.

22
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,208
Can't you hit back the
person who hits you?

23
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,416
That's wrong.

24
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,291
Will you keep quiet if someone hits you?

25
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,041
<i>That's what always happens.</i>

26
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,625
<i>My brother will land in a problem</i>

27
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,083
<i>but I end up getting blamed for it.</i>

28
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,583
<i>My father is a follower of Periyar.</i>

29
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,083
<i>My parents fell in love and</i>

30
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,708
<i>got married against their family's wishes.</i>

31
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:44,958
<i>So, it's just the four</i>
<i>of us in the family.</i>

32
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,916
<i>We support each other.</i>

33
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,041
Your brother is quite independent.

34
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,750
Learn something from him.

35
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,208
-Are you going to school regularly?
-Yes.

36
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,416
-Are you completing your homework on time?
-Yes.

37
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,458
-I will check with your teacher.
-Sure.

38
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,208
Wear your pants, apply
some powder and leave.

39
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,750
<i>My brother and I mean</i>
<i>the world to our mom.</i>

40
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,166
Give this to your brother.

41
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,166
Why don't you give it yourself?

42
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,083
<i>We are like every other sibling.</i>

43
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,583
<i>We also have minor problems and fights.</i>

44
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:23,625
<i>But our mother didn't</i>
<i>consider it to be a minor one.</i>

45
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,750
-Are you leaving for school?
-Yes.

46
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,250
Go safely.

47
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,375
Go.

48
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,666
-Are you leaving?
-Yes.

49
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,250
What happened?

50
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,458
Both of them are always fighting.

51
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,458
We thought that both
would support each other.

52
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,500
They are still young.

53
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,916
They don't understand certain things.

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,291
They'll understand with time.

55
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,958
Why are you worried?

56
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,125
<i>Now we are grown-ups.</i>

57
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:05,625
<i>He passed in group two exam</i>
<i>and got a job in the government quota.</i>

58
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,333
<i>I'm working in an IT company.</i>

59
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,833
<i>But our mother still keeps nagging us.</i>

60
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:14,041
<i>That's only because she</i>
<i>wants to get us married.</i>

61
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,166
<i>My parents have been looking for an</i>
<i>alliance for my brother for three years.</i>

62
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,875
<i>He doesn't want to get married.</i>

63
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,791
We have got an alliance
from Chinnalapatti.

64
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,375
They belong to a decent family
and the girl looks good as well.

65
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,000
She is a graduate.

66
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,083
They have asked us to come on Wednesday.

67
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,750
Shall we go and meet the family?

68
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,416
What do you think of yourself?

69
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,291
When will you get married?

70
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,875
Guys of your age have settled in life.

71
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,666
We need to get your younger
brother married as well.

72
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,625
Nowadays, many in town
elope and get married.

73
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,083
-I have to keep nagging you all the time.
-Mom!

74
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,666
<i>My brother agreed for the marriage</i>

75
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,750
<i>to get rid of mom's nagging</i>
<i>and his friends' advice.</i>

76
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,458
-That will get us some support--
-Let's go on Wednesday.

77
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,250
What did you say?

78
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,416
We can go.

79
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,166
Are you angry with me?

80
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,083
No. We may go.

81
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:17,958
Hi, Mom.

82
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,708
We have finalized an alliance for Anbu.

83
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:21,833
He likes the girl.

84
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:22,791
That's awesome, Mom.

85
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,208
They want the wedding
to be done this month itself.

86
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,958
They are coming to our house
on the 14th of this month.

87
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:27,958
Make sure you are here.

88
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,833
He will not like my presence.

89
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,750
Don't act smart.

90
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,083
How can you not be here
on such an important day?

91
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay, I will come for your sake.

92
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:40,041
You'll go back only
after the wedding is done.

93
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,416
Make sure you apply for
your leaves accordingly.

94
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,125
Okay.

95
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,375
Where is this guy?

96
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,458
I expected him to be
here with a bandwagon.

97
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,333
Why are you staring at me?

98
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,583
Do you consider girls cheap?

99
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,291
-Hey!
-Keep quiet.

100
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,208
You teased her on the
bus last Saturday, right?

101
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,416
Listen to me.

102
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,041
-Shut up.
-Listen to me.

103
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,875
I will not spare you if
you repeat your mistake!

104
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,708
Hey! He is not the one.
It's the other fellow!

105
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,833
What are you saying?

106
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:51,791
Let's go.

107
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,958
-What are you doing? Leave him.
-Bloody rascal!

108
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,083
Will you do it again?

109
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,250
Aruna, let's go.

110
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,208
Leave me! Such people--

111
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,041
-You shouldn't spare him.
-Everyone is watching us. Leave him.

112
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,375
Start the vehicle.

113
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,041
-Let's go.
-Oh, God!

114
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,875
Hey, dude!

115
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,583
You look nice.

116
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,333
You should ask me how I am.

117
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,208
Well, that's my style of greeting.
Where is bro?

118
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,958
We have a festival tomorrow, right?

119
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,208
-He's getting ready for it.
-Okay, let's go.

120
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,708
<i>The most valorous person has arrived</i>

121
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,583
<i>He's riding on a horse</i>

122
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,750
<i>He is endowed with all prosperity</i>

123
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,416
<i>He brings fame for us</i>

124
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,291
<i>We sing his praises</i>

125
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,916
<i>We shower him with love and affection</i>

126
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,041
<i>We live as brothers and relatives</i>

127
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,833
<i>We demand this without fear</i>

128
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,708
<i>This town should</i>
<i>Have everything in abundance</i>

129
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,166
<i>Our country should also prosper</i>

130
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,875
<i>We should become famous</i>

131
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,541
<i>We should have mental strength</i>

132
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,791
<i>We should follow the righteous path</i>

133
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,708
<i>We should be showered with good things</i>

134
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,458
<i>We sing his praises</i>

135
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,208
<i>We shower him with love and affection</i>

136
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,583
<i>We live as brothers and relatives</i>

137
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,583
<i>We demand this without fear</i>

138
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,583
<i>The wild young oxen will</i>
<i>Raise its mustache</i>

139
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,750
<i>And stare at you deeply</i>

140
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,541
<i>All suppressed desires will come out</i>

141
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,125
<i>And chase the young man</i>

142
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,333
<i>The young girls will give</i>
<i>Suggestions to you</i>

143
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,458
<i>Through their eyes</i>

144
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,958
<i>To show you the way</i>

145
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:23,708
<i>The children will ask</i>
<i>For sweets as a bribe</i>

146
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,208
<i>You should give us confidence</i>

147
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,791
<i>You should eradicate poverty</i>

148
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,833
<i>You should turn the sand into gold</i>

149
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,625
<i>You should protect people</i>

150
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,791
<i>This town should only speak truth</i>

151
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,541
<i>All should live together here</i>

152
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,291
<i>Everything should be created by you</i>

153
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,541
<i>You should say good words</i>
<i>And bless this town</i>

154
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,666
<i>This town should have everything</i>
<i>In abundance</i>

155
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,208
<i>Our country should prosper</i>

156
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:05,125
<i>We should become famous</i>

157
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,708
<i>We should have mental strength</i>

158
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,041
<i>We should follow righteous path</i>

159
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,000
<i>We should be showered</i>
<i>With all the good things</i>

160
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,708
<i>We sing his praises</i>

161
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,125
<i>We shower him with love and affection</i>

162
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,041
<i>We live as brothers and relatives</i>

163
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,458
<i>We demand this without fear</i>

164
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:39,291
She was a beautiful girl.

165
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,166
Get down.

166
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,958
Don't you have beautiful girls in Chennai?

167
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,208
It's not important where the girl is from.

168
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,666
It's important whether she's brave or not.

169
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,958
How do you know that she is brave?

170
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,125
She was beating a guy in front of--

171
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,791
What if she was drunk?

172
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,333
Who got beaten up by her?

173
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:03,291
Why do I feel that you
got beaten up by her?

174
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,500
Is it you?

175
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,333
Yes, you are the one.

176
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,500
I will listen to the
entire story tomorrow.

177
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,833
Come and have lunch at home.

178
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,208
Tigers never get down from the bike
even if they are hungry.

179
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,958
I didn't go along with your
family to the alliance's house.

180
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,416
Your mom is angry with me.

181
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,916
People are waiting for me at the temple.

182
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,500
-I will convince her tomorrow.
-Come with me.

183
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,625
-You monkey!
-He got scared.

184
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,750
-Please come.
-Hi, Dad.

185
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,000
What time are they coming tomorrow?

186
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,166
Why do you all look tense?

187
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,166
What happened?

188
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:37,541
Please sit.

189
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,333
Did he fall off the vehicle?

190
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,291
He doesn't even know how to cycle.

191
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,416
Why does he have to take such risks?

192
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,583
Why are you blabbering
without knowing the situation?

193
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:49,750
What happened?

194
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,375
Do you want to know about it?

195
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,250
-He has lost his mind again.
-Mom!

196
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:54,875
Keep quiet.

197
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,416
Mom, just tell me what happened.

198
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,958
Your brother rejected the proposal.

199
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:03,791
How did he get hurt?

200
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,083
-The girl's brother attacked your brother.
-Mom!

201
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,750
Can't you keep your mouth shut?

202
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,458
Hereafter, I will not even open my mouth!

203
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,041
-Do as you like.
-Just move aside!

204
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,958
Why are you behaving in this manner?

205
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,708
He is the one.

206
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:38,750
Are you Senthil?

207
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,250
Who are you?

208
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,125
Wait right here! I will bring my friends.

209
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,708
Wait right here!

210
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,458
They are coming to hit us.

211
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,125
-I will kill you.
-Hey! Who are you?

212
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:01,916
I am Anbu's brother.

213
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,208
How dare you beat my brother!

214
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,375
I am speaking to you.
Why are you looking at that side?

215
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,083
Don't you dare touch him again!

216
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,541
How long will you keep hanging on
the parachute? Jump!

217
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,208
-Come before the van.
-<i>Where?</i>

218
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,583
-Do you see someone behind the van?
-<i>Where is he?</i>

219
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,416
Go back. Try to follow him.

220
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,583
-<i>I will go after him.</i>
-Follow him.

221
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,000
Wait, I am coming.

222
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,250
-I am down here. Follow me.
-<i>Okay.</i>

223
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,375
-Do you see a bike there?
-<i>Yes.</i>

224
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,416
Get that bike.

225
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,000
Anbu, we have got
another proposal for you.

226
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,083
Don't you have any other work?

227
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,375
Why do you keep talking
about the same thing?

228
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,333
Please leave me alone.

229
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:42,666
You will remain single if you
keep saying such dialogues.

230
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,208
-Hey!
-Yes.

231
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,666
The girl's family likes you.

232
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,125
Stop looking for alliances!

233
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,583
I don't want to get married!

234
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,583
It is difficult to find a girl for you.

235
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,375
Why are you acting smart?

236
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:56,875
Bro!

237
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,833
Why did you beat the girl's brother?

238
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,125
You better answer her question first.

239
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,541
You've been here for two days.

240
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,208
He's already landed himself in trouble.

241
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,750
He fought with Pandi's relative
and the girl's brother.

242
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,708
Do you want me to not do anything?

243
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,250
You need not do anything for me.

244
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,625
I can handle my life.
You mind your business.

245
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,500
Hey! Arivu!

246
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,791
Feed him well.

247
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:21,958
Let him fight with everyone!

248
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,000
Let him get beaten by all.

249
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,541
Why don't you question them?

250
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,125
Look at their behavior.

251
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,958
Are they small kids?
They will change with time.

252
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,416
When they were young,

253
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,791
you said that they will
change when they grow up.

254
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,208
Now you are asking
whether they are small kids.

255
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,083
I don't know when
everything will be fine.

256
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,291
Don't you know about Anbu?

257
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,916
He might have said it in anger.

258
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:51,916
To heck with him!

259
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,583
-That's too much!
-After all, he is your friend.

260
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,750
-You will support him.
-You are my friend as well!

261
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:59,250
Hey! Cocktail and mutton fry are ready.

262
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:00,666
Shall we go?

263
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,500
Stop right here!

264
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,958
I am talking to you.

265
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,000
Take your hand off me.

266
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,208
Do you think you are great?

267
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,166
I have a lot of piled up work.

268
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,583
Do you know my value for an hour?

269
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,833
Do you know his value for one hour?

270
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,375
He just removes mud with JCB, right?

271
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,791
-Buddy--
-Did I ask you to speak?

272
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,708
Do you realize who you
are leaving behind?

273
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,500
I am the one who drove you to school

274
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:26,541
on cycle every day.

275
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,333
A friend who was a messenger
for your childhood love.

276
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,166
A teacher who taught
you how to smoke and drink.

277
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,833
That's how the sentiment works.

278
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,333
I didn't feel bad.

279
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,333
You don't need to apologize to me.
Come with me.

280
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,375
-Bro!
-Tell me.

281
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,333
She is the one.

282
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,041
So, didn't he stop for us?

283
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:53,958
Okay, tell me.

284
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,000
-That day--
-She slapped you.

285
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,416
-Oh, no! Why is he here?
-Hey!

286
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,958
Don't laugh at such things.

287
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,125
Hello.

288
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,708
-Wait. I will be back.
-Hey!

289
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,500
Hey!

290
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,291
Do I look like a ghost?

291
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,500
You slapped me the other day by mistake.

292
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,041
Why are you running away from me?

293
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,041
Did I make any mistakes?

294
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,250
Did you intentionally slap me?

295
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,500
You can apologize for it.

296
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,125
Or, will you have coffee with me?

297
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,000
Apologize to me or have a coffee with me.

298
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,750
You have pleaded enough, brother.

299
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,708
So, I have decided to stay back
only for you!

300
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:15,958
-Happy?
-No, buddy!

301
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,625
-Hey!
-You can leave.

302
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,125
-Buddy!
-You can leave.

303
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,375
You are my brother,
my friend, and my guru.

304
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,125
In short, you are my Godfather.

305
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,125
I don't want your concern.

306
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,541
He doesn't give a damn about us
but the strangers.

307
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:32,583
You can go.

308
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,583
-Push him and not me!
-Please go!

309
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,750
He said that he liked her.

310
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,250
-Oh, God!
-Why did he reject that girl?

311
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,708
That girl is in love with someone else.

312
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,291
-But--
-Shut your mouth!

313
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:51,500
It is a sin to make the bottle wait.
Drink quickly.

314
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,833
<i>He won't allow us to drink</i>

315
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,750
-<i>without telling him the truth.</i>
-Tell him.

316
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:01,833
Everything was going well.
One fine day…

317
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,291
Hello.

318
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:06,541
<i>Is it Mr. Anbu?</i>

319
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,958
Yes, tell me.

320
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:12,041
<i>Aruna and I have been in love</i>
<i>for the past two years.</i>

321
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,833
<i>We landed in trouble when our</i>
<i>family came to know about our love.</i>

322
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,250
<i>That's why they arranged</i>
<i>your marriage in a haste.</i>

323
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,250
What are you saying?

324
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,291
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

325
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,500
<i>Our family didn't accept our love.</i>

326
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:35,583
<i>It would be great if</i>
<i>you reject the proposal.</i>

327
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,875
<i>Please understand.</i>

328
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,041
If you tell me now--

329
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,375
Why can't you ask her
to reject the proposal?

330
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,666
<i>Poor Aruna!</i>

331
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:47,500
<i>If you reject the proposal, then we</i>
<i>will do something to set things right.</i>

332
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,708
Please hang up.

333
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,041
What is going on?

334
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,083
We have booked the banquet
and informed our relatives as well.

335
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,833
How can you reject the proposal now?

336
00:20:58,916 --> 00:20:59,833
This is not right.

337
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,958
Your girl is not suitable for our family.
Let it be.

338
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,291
The marriage hasn't taken place.

339
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,208
What are you saying?

340
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,708
We are not as cheap as you.

341
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:11,375
I told my wife that we should find
an alliance that matches our status.

342
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,958
But she was more
concerned about horoscopes.

343
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,208
It's not always about the
horoscopes but the people as well.

344
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,208
It is better to not have a
relationship with people like you.

345
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:23,250
I curse you that you will
never get married.

346
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,958
Mind your words!

347
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:25,875
-Hey!
-Who are you talking about?

348
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:26,791
Keep quiet.

349
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,083
Why don't you look after your daughter
instead of yelling at us?

350
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,458
We rejected this proposal
because of your daughter.

351
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,666
She is planning to
elope with her lover.

352
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,875
No one will marry your daughter.

353
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:40,041
She will bring a bad
reputation to your family.

354
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,458
Did he say that?

355
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,791
-Hey!
-Leave him!

356
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,000
Leave him!

357
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,333
-I will kill him!
-Leave him!

358
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:50,000
-Pull him back.
-Hey!

359
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,291
-Hey! Leave him.
-Leave me!

360
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,125
Why are you fighting with us?

361
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,041
Who called my brother?

362
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,250
Shall I tell you after drinking this?

363
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:13,250
You can drink after telling me.

364
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,458
I will speak nonsense.

365
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:15,916
-Drink now.
-Thank you!

366
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,750
Who is that boy?

367
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:34,041
Which boy?

368
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,125
The one who called Anbu.

369
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,541
He didn't get any calls.

370
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:43,458
How can you call off a marriage
without knowing who called?

371
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,333
Do you have his number?

372
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:47,416
You should ask your brother.

373
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,000
Get it from him and call him.

374
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,708
Did you drink?
Call him.

375
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,000
I think something is mixed in the toddy.

376
00:22:58,291 --> 00:23:00,125
It is very strong.

377
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,916
-Dude!
-Yes.

378
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:04,166
The number is switched off.

379
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,125
How will you reach him now?

380
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,875
Shall I help you get down?

381
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:23,791
Why did you ask us to come here?

382
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,416
-Someone called Anbu, right?
-Yes.

383
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,291
-He is in this village.
-So?

384
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:29,291
Something is wrong.

385
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,458
We will inquire about him.

386
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:31,875
How did you find him?

387
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:34,583
It is not difficult to trace a person's
address with his phone number.

388
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:35,875
The one in this photograph,

389
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:38,208
his name is Aalavanthan.

390
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,208
-Are you watching a porn movie?
-Yes.

391
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:41,333
We are seeing your movie.

392
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:42,875
Please don't block my way.

393
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,666
-You may leave.
-Okay.

394
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,000
Buddy!

395
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,083
He is the one in the photo.

396
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:50,750
Give me a boost.

397
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:52,583
Which college are you going to today?

398
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:54,500
Don't talk nonsense.
Make my drink.

399
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:57,250
Why is he staring at the unused notebook?

400
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,125
-Brother, cancel the boost.
-Here he goes.

401
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,166
I didn't even make one for you.

402
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:03,541
Hey!

403
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,500
Excuse me! Wait a minute.

404
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,458
-Wait a minute.
-Buddy, follow me on the bike.

405
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,000
Hey, buddy!

406
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:12,666
Why do you keep following everyone?

407
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,958
He is going alone, buddy.

408
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,541
-Walk aside.
-What is it?

409
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,333
Who are you?

410
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:37,750
Why are you following me?

411
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:39,791
Am I a beauty queen?

412
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:47,833
I love Aruna.

413
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,125
That is why I did that.

414
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:50,291
Does she love you?

415
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:52,166
What a stupid question!

416
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,291
Leave me. The blood is still flowing.

417
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:58,041
Why would I stop the
marriage if she loved me?

418
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,083
My brother's wedding got called off
because of you.

419
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,666
You will tell the truth
to the girl's family.

420
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:05,916
-If not, I will--
-I will come!

421
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:07,708
Not because you are threatening me.

422
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:10,250
I'll come with you as I
respect your intelligence.

423
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:11,333
Hey!

424
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:14,166
I don't have change.
You can come tomorrow.

425
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,250
I asked for the notebook.

426
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,000
Why do you have this notebook with you?

427
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,958
Didn't you think I was a college student?

428
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:20,958
No.

429
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:24,000
You need to drop me from
the point you picked me up.

430
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:25,041
Follow me.

431
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:26,625
Stupid fellow.

432
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:28,208
Why is he going on his own now?

433
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:36,291
Is this the house?

434
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:37,333
Yes.

435
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:38,750
Are you doubting me?

436
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:41,875
Is she the one?

437
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,083
Yes, she is the one.

438
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,750
She is the one chosen for Anbu.

439
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:58,125
Let's go back.

440
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,916
Don't panic.

441
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,083
I am coming with you.

442
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:03,000
I might abuse you.

443
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:05,541
She gets angry easily
but that's all right.

444
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:06,958
I know that.

445
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:10,916
-Have you also experienced her anger?
-Hey!

446
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:12,666
Lucky boy.

447
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:15,125
I got hit by her thrice.

448
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:20,583
What happened?

449
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:23,125
Why is your behavior
a bit strange today?

450
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:24,875
Are you going to meet Obama?

451
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,583
Obama's period is over.

452
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:28,208
Now it is Donald Trump's time.

453
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:30,750
Seeing pictures in the
newspaper is not enough.

454
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,333
-One should know to read.
-Hey!

455
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:33,541
I know it well.

456
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:34,833
Donald--

457
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:37,250
Come on. Say it.

458
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:39,791
Donald Trump. Buddy!

459
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:41,500
Donald… Trump.

460
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:42,583
-Tell me.
-Hey!

461
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:45,458
Why are you troubling me?

462
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:47,541
Does that girl live here?

463
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,625
How did you come to know?

464
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:53,625
Finding something out is
not a difficult task for me.

465
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,625
Your smile says everything.

466
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:59,333
Enough of smiling.

467
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:01,250
I will give you the breaking news.

468
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,541
Your brother…

469
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:07,750
The girl who was going to
marry your brother, lives here.

470
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,291
Don't go in front of them.

471
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:11,291
They will crush you.

472
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,916
-Buddy!
-Tell me.

473
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,041
Shall I give you some breaking news?

474
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:19,291
Not just the place
but it is the same girl.

475
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:32,291
-Uncle! How are you?
-I am fine. How are you?

476
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:35,250
Did you finally get the time to come home?

477
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:38,041
You guys never bother to inform me
about anything.

478
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,958
I heard that the marriage got called off.

479
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:40,916
What happened?

480
00:27:43,708 --> 00:27:45,458
Won't you share the problem with me?

481
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:46,833
Why should we share it?

482
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,875
We don't want to blow
it out of proportion.

483
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:51,875
Uncle, I will drop Aruna and be back.

484
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,041
Wait a minute.

485
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,083
Get inside the car.

486
00:27:57,291 --> 00:27:58,625
Tell me about that person.

487
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:00,291
Uncle, please be patient.

488
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:02,541
How can someone beat you?

489
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:06,291
We can deal with that matter later.

490
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:09,875
I can't tolerate the fact that
he spoke ill about Aruna.

491
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:12,916
I still wish to kill him and his family!

492
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:16,000
I don't want Aruna's name to be tarnished.

493
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:18,291
We will handle this after
Aruna's wedding is over.

494
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:19,958
I will inform you.

495
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:21,833
You can call me anytime.

496
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,541
Hey, Senthil!

497
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,625
The Star Cricket channel is deactivated.

498
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,333
Activate it while coming back.

499
00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:33,125
-Is there a cricket match today?
-Hey!

500
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:34,458
Today is the finals.

501
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:36,958
Today is England and
Australia's final match.

502
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:40,000
I will wait for you. Leave!

503
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:43,750
He is watching a test match.

504
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,750
He has been torturing me
with the matches for three years.

505
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,875
-Let's go.
-He is acting too smart.

506
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,000
He does not even respect me.

507
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:54,958
What wrong thing did I do?

508
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:57,125
I will not stay mum for long.

509
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,541
I know how I need to behave with everyone.

510
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:02,875
I don't want others' advice.

511
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:06,458
Did you see that?

512
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:10,291
-Take this.
-Hey!

513
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,791
-Isn't this too much?
-No!

514
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,791
She was selected for your brother.

515
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:16,250
But the marriage got called off.

516
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:17,875
This is wrong.

517
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:19,041
This won't work out.

518
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:21,500
-Why?
-Are you mad?

519
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:23,833
Both the families are not on good terms.

520
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:25,416
You also attacked her brother.

521
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:28,458
How can I let her go?

522
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,791
I think she is perfect for me.

523
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:32,458
We will think of other problems later.

524
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:34,416
It is not enough for you to like her.

525
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:37,541
-She should also reciprocate.
-This is the right point.

526
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,083
What should we do for that?

527
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:42,541
I should talk to her and understand her.

528
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:44,375
That's what I am going to try now.

529
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:48,875
And if she still doesn't
like me, then I will drop the plan.

530
00:29:48,958 --> 00:29:50,541
I don't think that will happen.

531
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:53,291
She will leave you as soon as
she comes to know who you are.

532
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:56,166
Thanks, dude!

533
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,041
Let us not disclose our identity.

534
00:29:58,791 --> 00:30:02,000
I'll apologize to her
if she starts liking me.

535
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,791
I think I am giving him ideas.

536
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:17,541
<i>You are like a charcoal quill</i>

537
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:20,250
<i>You look like a peacock when you smile</i>

538
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:22,333
<i>I lost myself but</i>

539
00:30:22,416 --> 00:30:25,041
<i>She evades me and disappears</i>

540
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,000
<i>Bright as a sun</i>

541
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:30,416
<i>She is a typhoon while angry</i>

542
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,125
<i>I become red when I see her</i>

543
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:35,666
<i>She continuously disturbs me</i>

544
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,416
<i>I got her for me</i>

545
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:41,041
<i>It is destined</i>

546
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:43,583
<i>I enjoy losing my sleep</i>

547
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:46,375
<i>It is a gift from her</i>

548
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,750
<i>She anchored herself</i>

549
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:51,458
<i>She raises in the middle of my heart</i>

550
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:56,333
<i>She rules like a queen there</i>

551
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:01,333
<i>You terrify me with your sharp sight</i>

552
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:03,916
<i>Your look is like a spear</i>

553
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,583
<i>You make me intoxicated in front of you</i>

554
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:11,833
<i>You give me love in pieces</i>

555
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:18,125
<i>You are the medicine for my lovesickness</i>

556
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:45,291
<i>I go majestically like an ox</i>

557
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:49,916
<i>But you vanquish me with your eyes</i>

558
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:53,250
<i>The unexpressed love sleeps inside</i>

559
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:55,500
<i>I earn value less money</i>

560
00:31:55,708 --> 00:32:00,000
<i>I wake up listening</i>
<i>To your words every day</i>

561
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:06,000
<i>I construct a bridge between us</i>

562
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:11,000
<i>But you demolished that</i>

563
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:13,916
<i>I can't differentiate</i>
<i>Between morning and evening</i>

564
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,333
<i>I don't get sleep at all</i>

565
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:21,583
<i>You spoiled my dream</i>

566
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:26,583
<i>You hide behind a screen</i>

567
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:29,666
<i>I am spiritless like night</i>

568
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,666
<i>You illuminate me like a light</i>

569
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:36,916
<i>You are like a needle in the clock</i>

570
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,541
<i>You fasten a saddle and lead me</i>

571
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:47,208
<i>You terrify me with your sharp sight</i>

572
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:50,041
<i>Your look is like a spear</i>

573
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:52,458
<i>You make me intoxicated in front of you</i>

574
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:57,166
<i>You give me love in pieces</i>

575
00:32:57,666 --> 00:33:02,500
<i>You are the medicine for my lovesickness</i>

576
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,625
<i>You are the one</i>

577
00:33:10,416 --> 00:33:13,083
Isn't he the one you beat at the bus stop?

578
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:16,458
He has been following me
for the past one week.

579
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:17,541
What did you do?

580
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,791
What will I do?

581
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,666
Is he following you
without you reacting to him?

582
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,666
You are after her for a week.

583
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:26,791
There is no response from the other side.

584
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:30,083
Her friend doesn't care about you as well.

585
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:38,333
Enough of it!
Tell me.

586
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,083
Okay, please note it down.

587
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:43,250
Her favorite colors are black and blue.

588
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:44,875
If you don't speak properly

589
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:46,666
then he will beat you once again.

590
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,583
She loves <i>idli</i> and biryani.

591
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:49,583
That's great.

592
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:52,208
She is crazy over
Yuvan Shankar Raja's music.

593
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,416
She likes the RX 100 bike.

594
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:59,041
She does not like your bike's color.

595
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:03,708
Shall we sell the vehicle and booze?

596
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,000
-Okay!
-I will kill you!

597
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:06,375
-Sorry.
-Go on.

598
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:08,625
She likes drawing and painting.

599
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:09,666
Okay.

600
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,750
She draws a lot.

601
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:13,958
But I don't know
whether it is good or bad.

602
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:16,958
Are you still following her?

603
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:21,166
She was wearing a white dress yesterday.

604
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:23,458
You were wearing a blue dress.

605
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:27,000
-Wow!
-Mr. Aalavanthan, stop following her.

606
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:29,333
-She is my lover.
-Okay.

607
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:32,125
How did you accept it so soon?

608
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:35,041
We must do what our lover likes.

609
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:37,041
That is true love.

610
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:40,125
I don't understand at all.

611
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:41,958
<i>Nobody understands me.</i>

612
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:04,666
She likes you.

613
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,041
She keeps observing you.

614
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:07,416
Lucky boy.

615
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:11,708
Henceforth, I won't trouble you. Bye.

616
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:14,625
Hey, please don't mistake me.

617
00:35:14,791 --> 00:35:17,000
Is this your full-time job?

618
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:18,875
Don't you have any other work to do?

619
00:35:19,541 --> 00:35:20,708
Oh, no.

620
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:23,833
We can't bear it if we don't have work.

621
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:26,250
How can you be happy?

622
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,916
Who else will spend my father's wealth?

623
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:31,000
What is your father doing?

624
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:32,666
He is the MLA of this constituency.

625
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:35,500
-What?
-MLA.

626
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:37,291
Is he an MLA?

627
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:41,125
We have been friends, right?

628
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:43,125
Please don't mind my words.

629
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:44,875
We will vote for your father.

630
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:48,000
The ones who lack self confidence

631
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:50,333
-tend to use their father's name.
-Okay.

632
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:52,625
-I will leave.
-I have a request.

633
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:55,916
It will take years for you to
spend your father's wealth.

634
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,833
Shall we help you out?

635
00:35:58,125 --> 00:35:59,125
I will ask my father and get back to you.

636
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:00,541
-Okay.
-Bye!

637
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:02,500
-Bye!
-Bye.

638
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:04,666
You changed the color of your bike

639
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,750
and the ringtone of your cell phone.

640
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:10,458
But, who is that on your t-shirt?

641
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:14,458
Where are we going?

642
00:36:15,791 --> 00:36:17,541
-Just come with me!
-Okay!

643
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:49,083
Who is that on your t-shirt?

644
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,500
I'm asking you.

645
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:53,083
Is that your relative?

646
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,416
There's no point looking over there.

647
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:57,958
She will not come.

648
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:03,291
-How do you know that?
-I just know it.

649
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:04,750
Why didn't you inform
me about that earlier?

650
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:05,916
-I will--
-Leave me.

651
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:08,750
You get angry when I don't
answer your unasked questions.

652
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:10,333
Did you answer my questions?

653
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:11,708
Tell me!

654
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,000
Bro, you won't understand all this.

655
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:15,958
Then, why don't you explain it to me?

656
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:18,458
His name is Vanco.

657
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:20,750
He is a famous drawing artist.

658
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:22,458
He draws and paints well.

659
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:24,583
She likes drawing.

660
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:26,791
Are you trying to impress her with this?

661
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:28,125
Right?

662
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:29,875
What wouldn't I understand?

663
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,291
Do you think you are superior
just because you are from Chennai?

664
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:35,583
How can you decide that we're fools?

665
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:39,125
Do you know the length of the JCB boom?

666
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:41,083
Do you know the number of buckets in that?

667
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:43,750
Do you know that?
Tell me!

668
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:46,916
Don't underestimate
the power of an ordinary man.

669
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:49,166
Sorry, dude!

670
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:51,750
Why did she not come today?

671
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:54,458
There's a festival going
on in their village today.

672
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:55,583
Dude.

673
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:57,166
What?

674
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,541
Do you want to go there?

675
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,833
Right? I know it well.

676
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:02,625
Take the vehicle home.

677
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:04,166
-Dude!
-What is it?

678
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,708
Do you want me to come like this?

679
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:07,375
You always want to look the best.

680
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,333
Let's go back home.
Let me change my dress.

681
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,250
<i>I need to find someone.</i>

682
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:31,958
Is this my mother-in-law's village?

683
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:33,458
If you get caught, then
you will be sent to prison.

684
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:34,708
Brother.

685
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,750
Brother, I was asked to give this to you.

686
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,875
-Really? Who said that?
-Hey!

687
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:41,541
Foolish boy.

688
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,083
They are near the stage.
Go and give it to them.

689
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:45,250
Why did he give that to me?

690
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:47,833
That belongs to the village dancers.

691
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,625
I asked the boy to give it to
them but instead, he gave it to you.

692
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:52,875
Remove the glasses.

693
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,250
You can laugh your heart out.

694
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:04,041
I know that you are laughing.

695
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:05,916
Your mouth will get disfigured.

696
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:11,208
Go there!

697
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,125
A kid is mocking me!

698
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:16,458
Where will she be?

699
00:39:18,541 --> 00:39:20,625
-Which one is better?
-I like both of them.

700
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,041
Dude! Aruna!

701
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:24,375
This hand…

702
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:26,083
What happened?

703
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:27,916
Shall I approach the girl coming with her?

704
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,791
She is like your daughter. Come with me.

705
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:33,291
-What do you say?
-Oh, no!

706
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:34,958
Dude!

707
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:36,375
Look over there.

708
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,208
Senthil is standing there.

709
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,416
Dude, he is here.

710
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,500
-Who is it?
-Arivu.

711
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:42,000
I think they are waiting to attack us.

712
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:43,416
Not us, but you!

713
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,833
Won't you take a beating for your friend?

714
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:48,083
Why should I take beatings for your love?

715
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,375
-What should we do now?
-Let's catch them!

716
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:50,958
-They are coming. Shall we escape?
-Let's escape!

717
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:52,000
Did he already escape?

718
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:55,875
I came here to find a girl
but now I am the one stuck.

719
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:58,208
They are coming to attack us. Save me.

720
00:39:58,291 --> 00:40:00,375
Dude, start the vehicle.

721
00:40:00,458 --> 00:40:03,250
The police will catch
us if we go in triples.

722
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:05,625
Be careful, dude.
My shirt will get ruined.

723
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:06,583
Come on!

724
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:09,750
If you have the guts, then
meet us at our village festival.

725
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,875
Hi!

726
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:38,916
How come you are here?

727
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,333
Hello! I should ask you this question.

728
00:40:41,416 --> 00:40:42,791
This is our place.

729
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:45,208
Why are you here?

730
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:48,708
I came here to get slapped.

731
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:51,291
Wait for some time.
You will get slapped.

732
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:52,791
-Sister.
-I am coming.

733
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:28,666
Everything is beautiful.

734
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:31,208
Why have you thrown them like this?

735
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:33,958
I am serious about it.

736
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,166
Hi!

737
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:44,750
Hi!

738
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:47,083
You asked for something, right?

739
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:48,833
You may ask her for it.

740
00:41:57,833 --> 00:41:59,583
Where are you from?

741
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:00,750
What's your name?

742
00:42:01,708 --> 00:42:02,833
Ariv--

743
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:05,791
Venkat.

744
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:07,791
I am from Pillaiyar Natham.

745
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:10,500
I have not seen you before.

746
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:13,541
I am working in an IT company in Chennai.

747
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:15,291
I am here for holidays.

748
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:17,000
I rarely come here.

749
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:20,750
I think you have been roaming
here for many days.

750
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:23,458
I need to leave soon.

751
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,750
I had to stay back and work from home

752
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:28,250
due to an unfinished business.

753
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:30,666
I'll leave once my job is done.

754
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:33,041
-What if your work is not done?
-Hey!

755
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:34,250
It is about my life.

756
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:36,375
How can you say that?

757
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:39,250
You better give a positive reply.

758
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:45,500
-Dude!
-Hello!

759
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:56,500
People never allow me to
watch a Hollywood movie.

760
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:59,750
I was right! Look at his stupid face!

761
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:01,916
-Silent.
-<i>It is very urgent.</i>

762
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,291
-I have work to do.
-<i>Please give it to me.</i>

763
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:06,125
I can't come right now.

764
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:28,375
-Hello.
-<i>Hey, Aruna.</i>

765
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:30,250
-Tell me.
-<i>Where are you?</i>

766
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:31,583
I am at the library.

767
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:33,541
<i>I am asking because</i>
<i>my vehicle got punctured.</i>

768
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:35,666
I can't come.
Why don't you come and pick it?

769
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:42,666
Who was that?

770
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:44,333
Why?

771
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:47,083
I just want to know.

772
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:49,625
That was my brother.

773
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:51,125
He wanted my vehicle.

774
00:43:51,666 --> 00:43:52,666
Bro--

775
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:56,458
Okay.

776
00:43:56,541 --> 00:43:57,750
I will see you later.

777
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:01,583
Dude!

778
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:12,375
Oh, my God!

779
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:15,125
I called you 32 times.

780
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:19,500
Won't you spare a person?

781
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:22,041
I was charging the phone in silent mode.

782
00:44:22,416 --> 00:44:25,833
My phone fell and broke just
because you were constantly calling.

783
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:27,458
Who asked you to put it in silent mode?

784
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:29,666
I had chosen Yuvan Shankar Raja's
music for the ringtone.

785
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,708
Had you answered my call,

786
00:44:31,791 --> 00:44:33,416
I would have got a chance to impress her.

787
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,000
If you want to impress her,

788
00:44:35,083 --> 00:44:38,208
then play Yuvan Shankar Raja's
song in front of her house.

789
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:39,750
-We will take care--
-Shut your mouth!

790
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:42,333
-Buy me a new mobile phone.
-Hey!

791
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:45,166
Do you want a new phone in
replacement of this cheap one?

792
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:46,708
I want a new one.

793
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:48,208
I will not buy you one.

794
00:44:48,291 --> 00:44:50,416
I would rather buy you juice.
Will you come with me?

795
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:59,208
How did you get convinced for juice?

796
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:02,125
You are anyway not going
to buy me a new phone.

797
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:04,583
I would rather have juice with you.

798
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:07,541
Leave that.

799
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:09,250
What about that girl?
What did she say?

800
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:11,708
Why are you asking me that?

801
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:16,375
-She stares, smiles--
-She stands up, sits down, sleeps.

802
00:45:16,458 --> 00:45:18,875
Don't try to mock poetry.

803
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:19,875
Come to the point.

804
00:45:19,958 --> 00:45:21,458
She didn't ask about the t-shirt.

805
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:22,791
-I changed the color of the bike.
-Yes.

806
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:24,041
She didn't even notice that.

807
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:25,791
I thought you will give me a call

808
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:29,333
and I would impress her with my ringtone.

809
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:31,083
You ruined everything.

810
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:33,416
Are you working in an IT company?

811
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,958
Or are you running an eatery stall
outside the company?

812
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,208
Why are you staring at me?

813
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:41,041
God knows why he changed the
color of the bike and wore that t-shirt.

814
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:43,916
Can you hear the ringtone only when
someone calls?

815
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,208
Wouldn't the alarm buzz you
with the same song?

816
00:45:48,416 --> 00:45:49,916
You need to be updated.

817
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:51,875
<i>Educated fellows!</i>

818
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,833
My uncle is coming here.

819
00:45:54,916 --> 00:45:56,750
-How are you, Arivu?
-I am fine, Uncle.

820
00:45:56,833 --> 00:45:58,750
Are you not going to Chennai?
Why are you still here?

821
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:00,000
I need to go but--

822
00:46:00,083 --> 00:46:01,666
-Greetings, Uncle.
-I couldn't meet you.

823
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:03,125
Try to leave soon.

824
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:05,041
You better don't hang around with him.

825
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:07,541
He is saying as if Sundar Pichai
used to roam with him.

826
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:10,500
Take these flyers and distribute
them all over Dindigul.

827
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:11,666
You are jobless.

828
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:12,625
Here he goes!

829
00:46:12,708 --> 00:46:13,958
Give me a cigarette.

830
00:46:15,708 --> 00:46:16,875
Pay for the cigarette.

831
00:46:16,958 --> 00:46:19,291
Why don't you rather jump in the well?

832
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,666
He is not even able
to pay for a cigarette.

833
00:46:22,208 --> 00:46:23,250
On top of that, he is advising me.

834
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:24,166
HANDICRAFTS AND ARTS
EXHIBITION IN DINDIGUL

835
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:25,833
Dude! What is this?

836
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,166
Handicrafts and arts exhibition.

837
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:30,666
That's how he cheats people every year.

838
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:37,208
I feel bad that you don't
have a mobile phone.

839
00:46:37,666 --> 00:46:39,666
Shall we purchase a new one for you?

840
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:43,333
DINDIGUL

841
00:46:44,791 --> 00:46:46,958

ARUNA PAINTING EXHIBITION

843
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,000
Who has done all this?

844
00:47:18,041 --> 00:47:19,041
Look over there.

845
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:26,541
<i>Dude, did you sell anything or not?</i>

846
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:29,208
No one even bothered to take a look at it.

847
00:48:29,625 --> 00:48:31,416
<i>Someone will come now.</i>

848
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:33,416
<i>The one in the green shirt is our man.</i>

849
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,125
-<i>Sell him two paintings--</i>
-I will call you later.

850
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:36,291
Welcome, sir.

851
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:17,708
Thank you.
This happened because of you.

852
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,166
Why are you being so formal?

853
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,458
You got rewarded for your talent.

854
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,208
We can't hide things for long.

855
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:26,291
Everyone will come to know about it.

856
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:28,541
I referred to the paintings.

857
00:49:31,208 --> 00:49:33,833
You can talk to me about anything.

858
00:49:34,125 --> 00:49:35,666
I won't feel bad about it.

859
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:40,791
Okay. Bye

860
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,208
We will place them back.

861
00:49:56,708 --> 00:49:58,125
Please go safely.

862
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:13,250
<i>Don't kill me slowly</i>

863
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:16,125
<i>Don't laugh within yourself</i>

864
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:20,625
<i>Eyes never lie</i>

865
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:23,250
<i>Don't keep things within you</i>

866
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:27,583
<i>Your handmade designs</i>

867
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:31,291
<i>Becomes the words of love</i>

868
00:50:31,541 --> 00:50:34,833
<i>The rhythm of my feet</i>

869
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:38,416
<i>Is in search of you</i>

870
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:45,166
<i>You mesmerized me in no time</i>

871
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,750
<i>Now I am imprisoned</i>

872
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:53,000
<i>Your eyes captivate me</i>

873
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:59,250
<i>I get dissolved in rain</i>

874
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:03,250
<i>You pulled me into the river</i>

875
00:51:03,333 --> 00:51:07,666
<i>Don't torture me with your loving words</i>

876
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:31,250
<i>Small messages on the screen</i>

877
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:32,916
<i>Turn into poetry</i>

878
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,625
<i>Your innocent smile induced me</i>

879
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:40,083
<i>Like the finger on the digital screen</i>

880
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:43,541
<i>My eyes devour your beauty</i>

881
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:48,000
<i>My heart searches for so many things</i>

882
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:50,791
<i>How long will you be</i>

883
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:54,375
<i>Without talking to me</i>

884
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:58,083
<i>Express your love for once</i>

885
00:51:58,416 --> 00:52:03,666
<i>I never fall for anyone</i>

886
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:08,166
<i>But now, I have fallen for you</i>

887
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:13,250
<i>Enchantment is the limit</i>

888
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:16,500
<i>The sound of thunder</i>
<i>Small desires</i>

889
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:20,208
<i>Power failure can't stop</i>

890
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:23,875
<i>The language of your eyes</i>

891
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:27,166
<i>Pours on me like music</i>

892
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:30,541
<i>We will</i>

893
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:34,333
<i>Walk in the rain</i>

894
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:37,833
<i>We will be with each other</i>

895
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,125
<i>And prove our love</i>

896
00:52:42,208 --> 00:52:48,250
<i>You mesmerized me in no time</i>

897
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:52,166
<i>Now, I am imprisoned</i>

898
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:56,750
<i>Your eyes captivate me</i>

899
00:52:56,833 --> 00:53:02,625
<i>I get dissolved in rain</i>

900
00:53:02,833 --> 00:53:06,916
<i>You pulled me into the river</i>

901
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,791
<i>Don't torture me with loving words</i>

902
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:44,791
Dad is looking out for an alliance.

903
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:46,416
Why are you telling me now?

904
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:48,041
He is a very good person.

905
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:50,750
I am sure you will like him as well.

906
00:53:52,458 --> 00:53:53,583
Or else, leave it.

907
00:53:54,125 --> 00:53:56,083
You can talk to dad only if you like him.

908
00:53:56,375 --> 00:53:58,166
Will you leave him if I don't like him?

909
00:54:02,416 --> 00:54:04,166
Let's meet him tomorrow.

910
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,291
When do you plan to get married?

911
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:17,583
Why are you teasing me unnecessarily?

912
00:54:17,666 --> 00:54:20,916
I am genuinely asking you but…

913
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:24,291
Even if it wasn't genuine, I will--

914
00:54:24,875 --> 00:54:25,833
-Hi.
-<i>Hello!</i>

915
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:26,750
Tell me.

916
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:28,125
When are you returning to Chennai?

917
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:29,583
No idea. Why?

918
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:33,666
You were going to go back
once your job was done, right?

919
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:35,125
Is that finished?

920
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:36,500
I think so.

921
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:38,583
I'll leave once I am sure about it.

922
00:54:39,166 --> 00:54:41,291
Let me know once it gets confirmed.

923
00:54:41,375 --> 00:54:43,333
<i>Hello! Wait a minute.</i>

924
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,250
-How will he know the value of love?
-Hey!

925
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,458
I will deal with you tonight.

926
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:49,666
-<i>Hello!</i>
-Tell me.

927
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:52,208
What is your opinion?

928
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:53,916
Will it get confirmed?

929
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:57,375
I will tell you in person.

930
00:54:57,916 --> 00:54:59,541
-I'm free. Should I come now?
-No.

931
00:55:00,791 --> 00:55:03,833
Come to Kumaran Park at 10:00 a.m.

932
00:55:03,916 --> 00:55:04,791
Okay.

933
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:07,583
-Dude.
-I know it.

934
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:08,916
She has accepted my love.

935
00:55:09,166 --> 00:55:12,666
I will tell her the truth
and apologize to her.

936
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:22,375
DINDIGUL MUNICIPAL CORPORATION
RENOVATED KUMARAN PARK

937
00:55:44,625 --> 00:55:46,875
Brother, Venkat…

938
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:04,666
Is he the one?

939
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:09,083
He is the brother of the guy who spread
rumors and got your marriage called off.

940
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:14,083
They tarnished our name
in front of our relatives.

941
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:20,333
Aruna, please.

942
00:56:20,416 --> 00:56:22,416
I came here to tell you the truth.

943
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,750
-But before that--
-Hey!

944
00:56:23,875 --> 00:56:25,458
We have already suffered
a lot because of you.

945
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:27,000
Are you here to trouble us more?

946
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:28,791
I want to curb this issue.
Don't ruin everything.

947
00:56:28,875 --> 00:56:30,416
Listen to me, brother-in-Law

948
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,875
I am not your brother-in-law!

949
00:56:35,833 --> 00:56:37,708
What did he do?

950
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:40,541
What is the problem?

951
00:56:40,791 --> 00:56:42,416
Did he misbehave with you?

952
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:44,500
The police station is nearby.

953
00:56:44,583 --> 00:56:45,666
Nothing like that.

954
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:46,958
It's our problem.

955
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:48,708
Let it be. I will deal with him.

956
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:56,625
Let's go, Aruna!

957
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:59,000
Aruna, please listen to me.

958
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:01,833
Aruna, listen to me!
Please!

959
00:57:44,708 --> 00:57:45,708
Sorry, Aruna.

960
00:57:47,416 --> 00:57:48,333
Okay.

961
00:57:50,791 --> 00:57:52,041
I apologized to you.

962
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:55,958
I accepted your apology.

963
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:57,625
You may go.

964
00:57:59,458 --> 00:58:00,875
What did I do?

965
00:58:02,041 --> 00:58:04,625
I liked you even before knowing
anything more about you.

966
00:58:05,083 --> 00:58:06,166
I liked you.

967
00:58:06,291 --> 00:58:07,625
I wanted to get in touch with you.

968
00:58:08,083 --> 00:58:10,916
Had you known about me,
you would have avoided me.

969
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:12,875
That is why I did not
disclose my identity.

970
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:15,250
That's the only thing I hid from you.

971
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:17,958
Why are you reacting so much
to a small issue?

972
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:20,375
Is this a small issue?

973
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:23,041
Do you know how my father was humiliated

974
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,500
when the marriage was called off?

975
00:58:25,916 --> 00:58:28,291
Your family spread rumors about me
and stopped the wedding.

976
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:32,500
My family members
did not cross check with me.

977
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:33,875
Why?

978
00:58:33,958 --> 00:58:36,375
My father didn't even let me know
about the incident.

979
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:38,625
My brother felt bad because
you spoke ill about me

980
00:58:38,708 --> 00:58:40,416
and not because you beat him.

981
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:43,833
What will I tell them now?

982
00:58:44,791 --> 00:58:45,666
Okay.

983
00:58:47,458 --> 00:58:48,708
We will discuss that later.

984
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:51,250
Do you like me or not?

985
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:55,250
You are still not thinking
from my perspective.

986
00:58:55,458 --> 00:58:56,958
You are just trying to justify yourself.

987
00:58:57,041 --> 00:59:00,958
Aruna… tell me if you like me or not.

988
00:59:01,833 --> 00:59:02,958
I did like you…

989
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:07,125
but not anymore.

990
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:12,500
Don't disturb me hereafter.

991
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:13,708
Go.

992
00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:17,875
Go.

993
00:59:17,958 --> 00:59:19,250
I feel ashamed.

994
00:59:52,583 --> 00:59:54,416
-Tell me, Venu.
-<i>When are you coming?</i>

995
00:59:54,708 --> 00:59:56,375
I need to work from home for
some more time.

996
00:59:56,458 --> 00:59:58,125
<i>It is not possible.</i>
<i>Come immediately.</i>

997
00:59:58,208 --> 00:59:59,958
I have offers from three companies, Venu.

998
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:02,458
-I will resign.
-<i>For how long do I extend your leave?</i>

999
01:00:02,541 --> 01:00:03,458
Ask him.

1000
01:00:03,541 --> 01:00:04,916
Come and have food.

1001
01:00:05,291 --> 01:00:06,166
Mom, ask him.

1002
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:09,125
Aren't you returning to Chennai?

1003
01:00:10,666 --> 01:00:12,708
Have the guts to tell me that
you don't like my presence!

1004
01:00:12,791 --> 01:00:14,041
Don't keep complaining.

1005
01:00:14,125 --> 01:00:15,250
What happened?

1006
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:16,791
-Why is he still here?
-Hey!

1007
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:18,750
Did you end up in trouble
and lose your job again?

1008
01:00:18,833 --> 01:00:20,875
I can take care of my life.

1009
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:22,708
It would be better if everyone
minds their own business.

1010
01:00:22,791 --> 01:00:24,833
-Don't try to overpower--
-Hey!

1011
01:00:24,916 --> 01:00:26,500
What will you do?

1012
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:30,500
Mom!

1013
01:00:30,583 --> 01:00:32,708
-Mom!
-Lift her.

1014
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:47,666
How is she now?

1015
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,333
There's nothing to worry about.

1016
01:00:49,541 --> 01:00:50,833
She fainted due to shock.

1017
01:00:50,916 --> 01:00:52,500
Her blood pressure is slightly high.

1018
01:00:52,666 --> 01:00:54,125
You can take her home once she is fine.

1019
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:55,666
-Don't worry.
-Okay, doctor.

1020
01:00:56,125 --> 01:00:57,000
Thank you, doctor.

1021
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:01,458
What happened?

1022
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:02,750
She just fainted.

1023
01:01:03,208 --> 01:01:04,208
She is alright.

1024
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:06,833
-The doctor--
-Why did you do this?

1025
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,250
-Why did you come here?
-Sir!

1026
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,208
Don't beat him!

1027
01:01:11,291 --> 01:01:12,916
-Did you come to check if she is dead?
-Please stop, sir!

1028
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:13,875
-Sir!
-What is it?

1029
01:01:13,958 --> 01:01:15,291
You are very weak.

1030
01:01:17,291 --> 01:01:19,708
Why are you both always
full of anger and ego?

1031
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:24,333
You were named Anbu and Arivu only
because you were loving and intelligent.

1032
01:01:24,416 --> 01:01:26,125
But neither of you have those qualities.

1033
01:01:29,416 --> 01:01:31,583
20 years ago,

1034
01:01:32,291 --> 01:01:33,583
I got involved in a matter.

1035
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:35,458
I was severely attacked.

1036
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:38,083
I somehow gathered myself.

1037
01:01:38,958 --> 01:01:40,333
My spinal cord was damaged.

1038
01:01:42,625 --> 01:01:43,541
Look at them!

1039
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:50,666
Since then she has been
supporting the family.

1040
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:53,833
She got you educated.

1041
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:59,708
She has never sulked about anything.

1042
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:03,458
She has never been harsh with me.

1043
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:05,416
That is love.

1044
01:02:06,375 --> 01:02:08,583
She wanted to get you both married.

1045
01:02:08,666 --> 01:02:09,833
Is that wrong?

1046
01:02:12,958 --> 01:02:17,166
Do we have anyone to support us
in adverse situations?

1047
01:02:18,916 --> 01:02:20,416
He won't talk to her directly.

1048
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:22,333
This one will land himself in trouble.

1049
01:02:23,708 --> 01:02:26,500
All she ever desired for was
that you both remain united

1050
01:02:26,916 --> 01:02:29,000
and support each other till the end.

1051
01:02:30,291 --> 01:02:32,083
Have you ever given her peace?

1052
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:36,291
Had something happened to her,
I would have killed both of you.

1053
01:02:37,208 --> 01:02:38,416
Don't stand in front of me.

1054
01:02:38,875 --> 01:02:40,166
-Go.
-Sir.

1055
01:02:40,458 --> 01:02:41,958
-Sit down.
-Ask them to leave.

1056
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:43,333
Sit down.

1057
01:02:54,458 --> 01:02:55,625
What did I do?

1058
01:02:56,208 --> 01:02:57,416
It happened because of him!

1059
01:02:58,333 --> 01:03:00,708
-Why is he angry with me?
-Hey!

1060
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,125
Don't act like a fool.

1061
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:03,833
He is not angry but concerned about you.

1062
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:04,958
Keep quiet.

1063
01:03:05,291 --> 01:03:07,416
Really? I find it to be stupid!

1064
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:10,333
I will not spare him.

1065
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:13,250
What do you think about yourself?

1066
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:17,500
You have always lived your life your way.

1067
01:03:18,166 --> 01:03:19,000
Have you thought about him?

1068
01:03:19,083 --> 01:03:20,750
He always bought clothes for you first

1069
01:03:20,833 --> 01:03:23,208
and then bought for
himself with the money left.

1070
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:27,000
Do you know what his ambition was?

1071
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:29,333
He was eager to do a Ph.D. in Physics.

1072
01:03:29,916 --> 01:03:31,625
He got a seat in IIT Calcutta.

1073
01:03:31,708 --> 01:03:33,458
He did not go.
Do you know why?

1074
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:35,833
Considering your education
and the family status,

1075
01:03:35,916 --> 01:03:37,708
he chose to rather opt for a job.

1076
01:03:39,833 --> 01:03:42,000
And after that, he
showed interest in Kayal.

1077
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:44,750
She is his colleague.

1078
01:03:45,833 --> 01:03:47,000
He loved her sincerely.

1079
01:03:48,083 --> 01:03:49,791
Give it at the first table.

1080
01:03:49,875 --> 01:03:51,375
Get it signed and come to me.

1081
01:03:51,458 --> 01:03:53,000
I will take care of it.

1082
01:03:57,916 --> 01:03:58,916
Kayal!

1083
01:04:05,666 --> 01:04:06,500
Sorry.

1084
01:04:07,208 --> 01:04:08,625
I don't know what to say.

1085
01:04:10,291 --> 01:04:12,208
I never thought you had feelings for me.

1086
01:04:14,458 --> 01:04:15,708
Don't you like me, Kayal?

1087
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:18,125
Nothing like that.

1088
01:04:19,541 --> 01:04:21,500
This won't work out. Leave it.

1089
01:04:26,083 --> 01:04:28,166
-Why can't this work out?
-I mean…

1090
01:04:29,083 --> 01:04:30,583
we belong to different castes.

1091
01:04:31,541 --> 01:04:32,791
My family will not agree.

1092
01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:36,291
Moreover, my family is
looking for an alliance.

1093
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:40,583
I don't want to invite
unnecessary problems at this time.

1094
01:04:40,666 --> 01:04:41,750
Let's avoid it.

1095
01:04:45,041 --> 01:04:46,791
I will talk to your parents, Kayal.

1096
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:49,500
You have no problem if they
agree to our marriage, right?

1097
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:00,375
Kayal!

1098
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:04,916
Please give me a chance.
I will talk to your parents.

1099
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:06,625
If they reject me,

1100
01:05:06,791 --> 01:05:08,333
I will not disturb you.

1101
01:05:10,958 --> 01:05:12,500
Almost everything is fixed.

1102
01:05:15,291 --> 01:05:17,166
We are going to the groom's
house tomorrow evening.

1103
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:18,416
Do come before that.

1104
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:20,333
Okay.

1105
01:05:21,791 --> 01:05:24,833
I can't do anything if dad rejects you.

1106
01:05:26,583 --> 01:05:29,250
Okay. I will come tomorrow.

1107
01:05:38,583 --> 01:05:39,583
Did he go and speak?

1108
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,333
When you came here the last time,

1109
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:44,416
you beat Nagarajan, right?

1110
01:05:44,666 --> 01:05:46,708
They put you in jail.
Do you remember that?

1111
01:05:46,791 --> 01:05:49,541
-Why are you deviating from the topic?
-Shut up!

1112
01:05:50,541 --> 01:05:52,208
It is connected.

1113
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,083
It is connected.

1114
01:06:07,083 --> 01:06:09,458
-Sir, please.
-What is it?

1115
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:10,916
Do you understand or not?

1116
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:14,041
He complaint about a murder
and got admitted in hospital.

1117
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:15,791
I can't do anything.

1118
01:06:15,916 --> 01:06:16,916
The case is filed.

1119
01:06:17,125 --> 01:06:18,250
Meet them in the court.

1120
01:06:18,333 --> 01:06:19,916
Try to compromise.

1121
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,791
Ask him to withdraw the case.

1122
01:06:21,916 --> 01:06:23,791
Then maybe I can try to help you.

1123
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:26,750
There is a holiday
for the next three days.

1124
01:06:26,833 --> 01:06:28,958
You can't even get bail.

1125
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:38,625
Dude!

1126
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:41,375
You may go to Kayal's house.
I will take care of this.

1127
01:06:41,458 --> 01:06:42,583
No, dude!

1128
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:44,500
My parents will feel bad about it.

1129
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:47,166
We can't let it go.

1130
01:06:48,291 --> 01:06:50,333
Poor fellow. Let us finish it first.

1131
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:16,666
We somehow managed to get out by night.

1132
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:19,125
He could not go to Kayal's house.

1133
01:07:19,208 --> 01:07:20,791
They arranged her marriage.

1134
01:07:24,208 --> 01:07:25,958
My friend lost his love because of you.

1135
01:07:28,708 --> 01:07:30,166
Why are you talking in this manner?

1136
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,666
That's why he is postponing his marriage.

1137
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:39,750
Is he going to remain single forever?

1138
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:41,916
She got married now.

1139
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:43,375
She is divorced as well.

1140
01:07:45,625 --> 01:07:47,166
He wants to try his luck again.

1141
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:50,541
He is helpless.

1142
01:07:52,375 --> 01:07:54,041
-He could have tried his luck.
-He did.

1143
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:56,125
But she avoids him.

1144
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:57,583
We know him well.

1145
01:07:57,833 --> 01:07:59,500
He does not want to disturb anyone.

1146
01:08:00,333 --> 01:08:01,375
The girl he loved…

1147
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,375
got transferred to the same office.

1148
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:09,166
Neither can he talk to her nor forget her.

1149
01:08:09,375 --> 01:08:10,791
He keeps thinking about her.

1150
01:08:11,625 --> 01:08:13,333
He agreed to get married…

1151
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:16,625
so that your marriage
doesn't get affected.

1152
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:23,375
Tell me.

1153
01:08:24,416 --> 01:08:26,791
My dear friend…

1154
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:28,291
Anbu is great.

1155
01:08:33,958 --> 01:08:34,791
Get lost!

1156
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:37,583
Nonsense!

1157
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:33,291
This can't happen.
Please let it be.

1158
01:09:33,541 --> 01:09:36,333
You keep saying this again and again.

1159
01:09:36,666 --> 01:09:38,625
But you didn't say that you dislike Anbu.

1160
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:41,750
We will let you go if you tell us that
you don't like him.

1161
01:09:42,958 --> 01:09:45,708
Your brother promised to
come home for discussion.

1162
01:09:45,791 --> 01:09:46,875
But he never turned up.

1163
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:48,916
You are telling the same now.

1164
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:50,708
We gave you the reason for the same.

1165
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:52,041
Why are you repeating that?

1166
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:54,333
Just think about it.
He is so attached to his brother.

1167
01:09:54,416 --> 01:09:55,750
Won't he love you even more?

1168
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:57,291
Try to understand.

1169
01:09:58,583 --> 01:09:59,958
Do you like him?

1170
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:01,625
You have confidence in him, right?

1171
01:10:06,875 --> 01:10:08,416
I think Kayal loves Anbu.

1172
01:10:09,083 --> 01:10:10,500
I also thought the same.

1173
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,208
I am sure she loves him.

1174
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:15,416
She was angry that he didn't
turn up at her house that day.

1175
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,458
Both fools loved each other.

1176
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:20,416
They never expressed it
and now they have landed in this state.

1177
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,083
Shall we speak to Kayal's family?

1178
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:26,583
No, dude! We will
make him speak to her family.

1179
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:29,416
How is it possible?
Will he speak?

1180
01:10:29,791 --> 01:10:31,541
He does not know Kayal's residence.

1181
01:10:31,708 --> 01:10:33,041
We will take him there.

1182
01:10:34,333 --> 01:10:35,541
Do you know the address?

1183
01:10:36,458 --> 01:10:37,500
I can find that out.

1184
01:10:38,583 --> 01:10:41,375
Who will take him there?

1185
01:10:43,416 --> 01:10:44,416
<i>Where are you?</i>

1186
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,250
In front of the house.

1187
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:49,458
Don't disclose anything to him or else
he will not come.

1188
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:53,333
Okay, I will take care of it.

1189
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:55,000
Let us go.

1190
01:10:56,541 --> 01:10:57,375
What are you doing?

1191
01:10:57,458 --> 01:10:59,625
You are the groom.
I will ride the bike.

1192
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:00,666
Aren't your parents coming?

1193
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:02,041
My parents have met her.

1194
01:11:02,166 --> 01:11:03,916
Arivu didn't agree to come with me.

1195
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:08,250
He never entertains such things.
Let's go.

1196
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:12,875
He is going with him.

1197
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:15,625
I hope he expresses his feelings.

1198
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:17,708
He should not know our plans.

1199
01:11:17,833 --> 01:11:19,625
-He will kill me if he comes to know.
-Isn't that Arivu?

1200
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:21,541
He will not spare us.

1201
01:11:29,583 --> 01:11:31,916
-Dude.
-Tell me. Do this work.

1202
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:35,000
-I think Arivu is alone here.
-Really?

1203
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:37,666
He is here with his friend.

1204
01:11:38,166 --> 01:11:39,541
Do you see any villagers there?

1205
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:41,458
It's a barren land.

1206
01:11:41,541 --> 01:11:42,958
There is no one out here.

1207
01:11:43,083 --> 01:11:44,458
You won't get a better opportunity.

1208
01:11:44,541 --> 01:11:45,875
-Wait a minute.
-Come quickly.

1209
01:11:45,958 --> 01:11:46,916
Okay, I will be there.

1210
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,375
He shouldn't come to know about you.
Stay alert.

1211
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:58,833
Sir.

1212
01:12:00,041 --> 01:12:01,291
Please sit down.

1213
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:04,500
I will hang up.
I will call you later.

1214
01:12:07,916 --> 01:12:09,208
-Greetings.
-Is this Kayal's house?

1215
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:11,458
Yes. She is my daughter.
What is the matter?

1216
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,916
He is Anbu. He is her colleague.

1217
01:12:15,083 --> 01:12:16,375
I am happy to know that.

1218
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:17,958
Hey!

1219
01:12:19,333 --> 01:12:20,500
-Let's go.
-Please wait.

1220
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:24,583
-Hey.
-Please wait.

1221
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:26,125
What do you want?

1222
01:12:27,458 --> 01:12:28,416
I am talking to you.

1223
01:12:29,291 --> 01:12:33,458
<i>Don't prolong the space</i>

1224
01:12:33,666 --> 01:12:35,208
-What do you want?
-Brother.

1225
01:12:35,291 --> 01:12:36,791
Please say something.

1226
01:12:37,291 --> 01:12:38,833
Pour your heart out.

1227
01:12:39,375 --> 01:12:41,708
This is your chance
to speak your heart out.

1228
01:12:41,916 --> 01:12:45,833
<i>Without conjoining</i>
<i>Don't go</i>

1229
01:12:45,916 --> 01:12:47,375
What do you want?

1230
01:12:50,208 --> 01:12:52,708
-I am talking to you.
-I want your daughter.

1231
01:12:54,625 --> 01:12:58,875
<i>The moment you asked to say a poem</i>

1232
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,458
I have loved her for two years.

1233
01:13:01,083 --> 01:13:02,083
She also likes me.

1234
01:13:02,166 --> 01:13:06,000
<i>Don't let the time go</i>

1235
01:13:06,208 --> 01:13:07,291
Get your daughter married to me.

1236
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:13,458
<i>I'll reach the shore swimming</i>
<i>In the flood of love</i>

1237
01:13:13,916 --> 01:13:15,666
I am happy to hear all this.

1238
01:13:16,041 --> 01:13:17,958
I will be happy if she
gets settled in life.

1239
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:20,250
You are not scared to speak about it.

1240
01:13:20,541 --> 01:13:21,708
What about your family?

1241
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:24,458
What if my daughter comes back
running to me?

1242
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,166
She already got divorced once.

1243
01:13:29,333 --> 01:13:30,375
Kayal is my life.

1244
01:13:32,791 --> 01:13:34,250
I will take good care of her.

1245
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,000
Did you discuss it with your family?

1246
01:13:43,291 --> 01:13:45,333
Speak to your family and come back.

1247
01:13:54,291 --> 01:13:57,000
Hey! Didn't you check the petrol?

1248
01:13:57,083 --> 01:13:58,083
Sorry, buddy!

1249
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:00,000
How will we take our men along?

1250
01:14:00,833 --> 01:14:03,291
Come with our men in another car.

1251
01:14:13,208 --> 01:14:14,208
-Hey.
-Yes, bro.

1252
01:14:15,166 --> 01:14:16,541
I ended up pouring my heart out.

1253
01:14:16,625 --> 01:14:17,958
How do I tell my parents?

1254
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:19,666
We can ask Arivu to speak about this.

1255
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:21,500
Do you want to ruin it?

1256
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:23,250
Why are you talking in this manner?

1257
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:25,000
He likes you a lot.

1258
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:28,916
-He never lets you down.
-Hey!

1259
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,125
-Keep quiet.
-Bro.

1260
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:31,333
What is your problem?

1261
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,750
He hit Senthil just
because he attacked you.

1262
01:14:36,375 --> 01:14:37,625
Do you remember Nagarajan?

1263
01:14:38,916 --> 01:14:41,541
He mocked you by saying
that you are impotent.

1264
01:14:41,666 --> 01:14:42,833
That's why he beat him.

1265
01:14:45,208 --> 01:14:48,541
It was Arivu's plan to bring
you here to speak to Kayal.

1266
01:14:50,791 --> 01:14:52,208
You are the one…

1267
01:14:53,458 --> 01:14:55,291
who never understands him.

1268
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:00,791
You always keep complaining.

1269
01:15:00,916 --> 01:15:02,500
Do you know why he ends up
fighting with everyone?

1270
01:15:02,583 --> 01:15:04,458
He fights because everyone
makes fun of you.

1271
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:08,208
-Get lost.
-Hey.

1272
01:15:08,791 --> 01:15:09,875
Where is he now?

1273
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:17,666
There they are.

1274
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:19,250
They are alone.

1275
01:15:22,166 --> 01:15:24,166
Hey, dude.

1276
01:15:25,166 --> 01:15:26,708
We should finish them today.

1277
01:15:26,916 --> 01:15:28,750
They should never mess with us.

1278
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:31,083
Oh, my God!

1279
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:36,625
Stop the bus.

1280
01:15:36,708 --> 01:15:38,541
-I did it by mistake!
-Why isn't anyone questioning them?

1281
01:15:38,625 --> 01:15:40,500
-My daughter's life is spoiled.
-Throw them out!

1282
01:15:40,583 --> 01:15:43,791
Leave my shirt.

1283
01:15:44,625 --> 01:15:46,291
Why did you put
your hand on that girl?

1284
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,541
Dude, there seems to be a problem.

1285
01:15:49,541 --> 01:15:51,458
-I think it is a pickpocket case.
-No!

1286
01:15:51,583 --> 01:15:53,791
Our villagers never
have money in their purse.

1287
01:15:53,875 --> 01:15:55,250
Let's go and see.

1288
01:16:00,583 --> 01:16:01,541
Dude!

1289
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:03,541
-It is your brother-in-law.
-Yes!

1290
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:05,000
I can beat him.

1291
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:06,500
How can strangers beat him?

1292
01:16:06,583 --> 01:16:07,666
Go and ask them.

1293
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:08,625
Let's ask them.

1294
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,916
Hey! Please move!

1295
01:16:11,125 --> 01:16:13,375
Please wait.

1296
01:16:13,458 --> 01:16:14,916
What is the problem?

1297
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:15,958
To heck with the problem!

1298
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:18,083
In broad daylight, this fellow--

1299
01:16:18,166 --> 01:16:19,333
-Did he pickpocket someone?
-Hey!

1300
01:16:19,416 --> 01:16:21,541
-What?
-He molested a girl!

1301
01:16:21,708 --> 01:16:23,625
That too in front of her father.

1302
01:16:23,791 --> 01:16:25,333
Did he molest a girl?

1303
01:16:25,416 --> 01:16:26,958
He tried to molest a girl.

1304
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:28,125
-Let's escape.
-Buddy.

1305
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,208
He won't molest anyone.
It would be something else.

1306
01:16:30,291 --> 01:16:32,000
-Okay.
-That's when I can support him

1307
01:16:32,083 --> 01:16:33,583
and solve the matter between us.

1308
01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:35,750
-Go and check.
-Wait, I will do it.

1309
01:16:35,833 --> 01:16:39,041
Do you really think this man
would have molested a girl

1310
01:16:39,125 --> 01:16:41,500
in broad daylight that
too in front of her father?

1311
01:16:41,583 --> 01:16:42,583
Are you not ashamed?

1312
01:16:42,791 --> 01:16:44,500
Do you all belong to this village?

1313
01:16:44,791 --> 01:16:46,583
-Do you think no one will question?
-What is it?

1314
01:16:46,666 --> 01:16:48,333
-What is it?
-A person can't keep marrying girls

1315
01:16:48,416 --> 01:16:50,333
just because his hands got
brushed against someone's body.

1316
01:16:50,416 --> 01:16:51,791
Hey! What is this?

1317
01:16:52,083 --> 01:16:53,708
You are antagonizing your friend.

1318
01:16:53,791 --> 01:16:57,208
Buddy, I always support
justice more than friendship.

1319
01:16:57,291 --> 01:16:59,166
I will support my brother in law.

1320
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:02,458
Yeah, right! You have different rules
for every person.

1321
01:17:02,541 --> 01:17:03,541
-Yeah, right!
-Why do you have

1322
01:17:03,625 --> 01:17:04,916
different rules for him and others?

1323
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,791
Ask your brother-in-law to marry her.

1324
01:17:07,958 --> 01:17:09,166
-Why are you all quiet?
-Hey!

1325
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:11,791
That's not done! That's not possible!

1326
01:17:11,875 --> 01:17:13,458
-That can't happen!
-Are you sure?

1327
01:17:13,541 --> 01:17:15,541
We will go to the police.

1328
01:17:15,625 --> 01:17:17,958
-Call the police.
-Wait a minute.

1329
01:17:18,041 --> 01:17:19,125
Come here.

1330
01:17:20,333 --> 01:17:22,041
-What class are you studying now?
-Class 11.

1331
01:17:22,166 --> 01:17:23,875
She is a school-going girl.
Do you know her age?

1332
01:17:23,958 --> 01:17:26,125
-26 years old!
-What--

1333
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:28,458
She is only 16. She is a minor.

1334
01:17:28,541 --> 01:17:29,416
Do you know the consequences

1335
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:30,375
-of marrying a minor girl?
-What will happen?

1336
01:17:30,458 --> 01:17:31,291
Do you know?

1337
01:17:31,375 --> 01:17:36,875
If a complaint is registered,
all of you will be sent to jail.

1338
01:17:36,958 --> 01:17:37,916
Are you all ready to go?

1339
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,416
-Come on, let's go.
-Are you threatening us?

1340
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:42,458
-Let's deal with it.
-Don't be afraid. I am there for you.

1341
01:17:42,541 --> 01:17:43,750
I know Lawyer Bharath Subramaniyam.

1342
01:17:43,833 --> 01:17:45,250
-Call him.
-Wait, I will call him.

1343
01:17:45,416 --> 01:17:46,500
-Call whoever you like.
-Why don't you call someone?

1344
01:17:46,583 --> 01:17:49,250
-I know the MLA.
-I know the MP.

1345
01:17:49,416 --> 01:17:50,958
-I know OS
-I know ES.

1346
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:53,000
-Go and call them.
-Give me the phone.

1347
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:55,458
-Call him right away.
-My brother-in-law many of them.

1348
01:17:55,541 --> 01:17:56,958
Isn't it, brother?

1349
01:17:57,333 --> 01:17:58,750
Is there some kind of a joke going on?

1350
01:17:58,833 --> 01:18:00,000
-Hey.
-I am not your brother-in-law.

1351
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:02,000
I will smash you.

1352
01:18:02,083 --> 01:18:02,958
Take your hands off.

1353
01:18:03,041 --> 01:18:05,375
Don't you dare touch him!
Take your hands off him!

1354
01:18:06,666 --> 01:18:08,041
What is going on?

1355
01:18:10,708 --> 01:18:13,166
What will you do if
someone tells you that the girl

1356
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:15,041
you're going to marry is
in love with someone else?

1357
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:17,166
I agree that I shouldn't have
believed anything blindly.

1358
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:18,583
What do you want me to do now?

1359
01:18:20,125 --> 01:18:21,458
What else should I have done?

1360
01:18:21,625 --> 01:18:22,750
It is not only for me.

1361
01:18:22,833 --> 01:18:25,041
People force girls to
marry against their wish.

1362
01:18:25,125 --> 01:18:27,083
I stopped the marriage as I felt
bad for the girl.

1363
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:29,500
Why are you always quarreling with him?

1364
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:35,208
Why don't you talk it out?

1365
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:36,791
Don't instigate it even more.

1366
01:18:41,208 --> 01:18:46,083
Why are you all sitting with sad faces?

1367
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:47,625
No matter what, you all

1368
01:18:47,708 --> 01:18:50,125
should feel lucky to have
him as your brother-in-law.

1369
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:53,791
I want to know something.

1370
01:18:54,041 --> 01:18:55,916
Do you know that
your sister is a painter?

1371
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:59,041
My buddy conducted an exhibition for her.

1372
01:19:00,125 --> 01:19:02,625
Listen to me.
Get her married to my buddy.

1373
01:19:02,791 --> 01:19:03,791
She will be happy.

1374
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:06,291
He ruined my love story
and is now in love with my sister.

1375
01:19:06,375 --> 01:19:07,541
Do you want me to help him?

1376
01:19:07,625 --> 01:19:08,541
That's too much.

1377
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:13,125
<i>I have been in a one-sided love</i>
<i>for the past one and half years.</i>

1378
01:19:16,541 --> 01:19:17,958
<i>It was her birthday that day.</i>

1379
01:19:18,041 --> 01:19:19,375
<i>I was going to propose to her.</i>

1380
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:21,250
<i>That's when you beat me.</i>

1381
01:19:23,041 --> 01:19:24,708
<i>You hit me in front of her.</i>

1382
01:19:35,083 --> 01:19:36,000
What is this?

1383
01:19:36,083 --> 01:19:39,833
Why are you all
putting the blame on me?

1384
01:19:39,958 --> 01:19:42,291
Buddy, you can't lose your temper now.

1385
01:19:42,458 --> 01:19:44,041
You've committed many mistakes.

1386
01:19:45,291 --> 01:19:47,333
Sorry! It was my mistake.

1387
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:48,791
How do I face her now?

1388
01:19:48,875 --> 01:19:50,166
Oh, my God!

1389
01:19:50,333 --> 01:19:52,041
He is worse than him.

1390
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:55,666
People are following new ways of lifestyle
but you still seem to be orthodox.

1391
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:57,916
You still follow the idea of giving
greeting cards and roses.

1392
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,916
As if he is busy with two girls every day.

1393
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:03,708
Buddy, you are still single, right?

1394
01:20:03,875 --> 01:20:06,291
I am fortunate to be
alive in your company.

1395
01:20:06,375 --> 01:20:07,875
How will I have girlfriends?

1396
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:09,375
Don't worry about anything.

1397
01:20:09,458 --> 01:20:11,875
We will make your love successful.

1398
01:20:13,083 --> 01:20:14,125
Are you serious?

1399
01:20:14,458 --> 01:20:16,333
The problem is that he beat you
in front of your girlfriend.

1400
01:20:16,416 --> 01:20:18,416
Why don't you beat him
up in front of your girl?

1401
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,750
She will like you.
The problem will be solved.

1402
01:20:22,375 --> 01:20:24,208
-Are you my brother?
-You beat him, right?

1403
01:20:24,291 --> 01:20:26,208
-I did for you.
-Did I ask you to help?

1404
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:28,583
I am blessed with an evil family.

1405
01:20:28,875 --> 01:20:32,375
Buddy, you just have to act
as if you are beating me.

1406
01:20:32,833 --> 01:20:35,583
Don't keep anything in mind
and take revenge against me.

1407
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:37,833
Okay, buddy.

1408
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:40,291
We will meet tomorrow at the same place
and the same time.

1409
01:20:41,166 --> 01:20:44,208
Superb! I don't think this will work out.

1410
01:20:44,458 --> 01:20:46,000
-I am sure it will work.
-Okay, we shall see!

1411
01:20:46,083 --> 01:20:48,166
Bro, just like Sarath Kumar
from <i>Naadodigal</i>--

1412
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:51,291
Sorry! Just like Sasi Kumar,
I am here to help you.

1413
01:20:51,458 --> 01:20:52,458
I will take care of it.

1414
01:20:52,541 --> 01:20:53,958
Jenny is coming.

1415
01:20:54,625 --> 01:20:55,875
That is Jenny.

1416
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:58,875
Hey, she might just leave from here.

1417
01:20:58,958 --> 01:21:00,708
-Please draw her attention.
-Sure!

1418
01:21:00,791 --> 01:21:01,708
What is it?

1419
01:21:01,833 --> 01:21:03,375
-I will draw her attention. Go.
-Hey!

1420
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:05,166
-Just come here.
-Hey, she is here.

1421
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:09,208
Please save him!

1422
01:21:09,416 --> 01:21:12,583
Please save him!

1423
01:21:12,666 --> 01:21:16,791
Please save him!

1424
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:19,333
Please save him! Sister!

1425
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:22,000
-Please move.
-Please help me out.

1426
01:21:22,083 --> 01:21:24,208
-He is a very sensitive fellow.
-Please move!

1427
01:21:24,291 --> 01:21:26,416
How will he manage now?

1428
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:29,041
Anyone with a white shawl can save him!

1429
01:21:29,166 --> 01:21:31,833
-Leave me!
-Please save me!

1430
01:21:31,916 --> 01:21:33,625
-Beat him up!
-He is going to die.

1431
01:21:33,708 --> 01:21:35,708
-I am getting late.
-He is going to die.

1432
01:21:35,958 --> 01:21:37,458
-Beat me.
-What are you thinking?

1433
01:21:37,541 --> 01:21:39,708
You can beat him if you know him.

1434
01:21:40,666 --> 01:21:44,333
Oh, God! Please save me from these fools.

1435
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:47,791
Save him.

1436
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:50,416
-Greetings, sir.
-Save him.

1437
01:21:50,583 --> 01:21:52,375
Why is everybody silent?

1438
01:21:53,666 --> 01:21:55,208
My goodness! The police are here.

1439
01:21:55,291 --> 01:21:57,958
-Hey!
-I am caught!

1440
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:00,916
Hey, get lost!

1441
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,458
Girls have finally
gathered the courage to study.

1442
01:22:03,541 --> 01:22:05,750
Such fights will scare them again!

1443
01:22:05,833 --> 01:22:09,125
Fools! Go and help them study!

1444
01:22:10,708 --> 01:22:13,250
Sir, he means the world to me.

1445
01:22:14,083 --> 01:22:16,875
He is my brother, my friend, my guru.

1446
01:22:17,875 --> 01:22:20,375
-<i>Why is he putting me in trouble?</i>
-He is my godfather.

1447
01:22:28,166 --> 01:22:30,250
Hey! Take that
handkerchief off your face.

1448
01:22:30,333 --> 01:22:33,250
You're behaving as if you are a terrorist.

1449
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,916
-Take it off!
-What if the media puts up

1450
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,041
my photo in the news?

1451
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:39,041
No one will get married to me.

1452
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:40,083
Are you getting any proposals?

1453
01:22:40,166 --> 01:22:41,250
Greetings, sir.

1454
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:45,708
You are creating a ruckus
in front of the college.

1455
01:22:46,791 --> 01:22:50,583
You all don't look like college students.

1456
01:22:50,666 --> 01:22:52,208
Do we look like professors?

1457
01:22:52,333 --> 01:22:54,541
-I will beat you up!
-No, sir.

1458
01:22:54,625 --> 01:22:56,500
-It was just for--
-Wait a minute.

1459
01:22:57,750 --> 01:23:00,125
Sir, I will tell you what happened…

1460
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:01,625
This guy is my uncle.

1461
01:23:01,791 --> 01:23:03,500
-But he is like my brother.
-Are you wearing your undergarments?

1462
01:23:03,583 --> 01:23:04,500
Why?

1463
01:23:04,666 --> 01:23:06,541
They will take off our clothes now.
-The girl

1464
01:23:06,625 --> 01:23:08,333
and this guy were in love and I--

1465
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:10,625
-Sir.
-We got rid of him.

1466
01:23:10,708 --> 01:23:11,625
Sir, I am a good boy.

1467
01:23:11,916 --> 01:23:14,166
Keep the darkroom ready.

1468
01:23:14,333 --> 01:23:15,791
-We need to beat them up.
-Okay.

1469
01:23:15,875 --> 01:23:16,750
Oh, my God!

1470
01:23:18,583 --> 01:23:21,291
I told you that this plan
will not work out.

1471
01:23:21,583 --> 01:23:24,708
He is talking as if he is preparing
for an occasion.

1472
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:27,291
Buddy, I did not know that we have
landed ourselves in trouble?

1473
01:23:27,375 --> 01:23:29,916
That day you beat me
severely but no one came out.

1474
01:23:30,333 --> 01:23:33,125
-It was just a mockery today.
-What will happen now?

1475
01:23:36,375 --> 01:23:38,625
Are we going to be
held for another problem?

1476
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:45,833
I would have begged
her and convinced her.

1477
01:23:46,375 --> 01:23:48,541
It was enough that she saw me
get beaten up.

1478
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:51,083
But now, she has seen
me in this state as well.

1479
01:23:52,125 --> 01:23:55,458
Here he comes.
Sir, we are good people.

1480
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:57,416
They brainwashed me and got me here.

1481
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,666
All of you, get up.

1482
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:03,541
You should have told me that
you know the lawyer, Karthik.

1483
01:24:04,458 --> 01:24:05,333
You may leave.

1484
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:07,166
Let us escape.

1485
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:09,083
They may change the case.

1486
01:24:12,125 --> 01:24:14,208
Thank you. Who is he?

1487
01:24:14,291 --> 01:24:15,541
Is he your family lawyer?

1488
01:24:15,958 --> 01:24:17,541
He is my family member.

1489
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:21,750
He is my father.

1490
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,583
Lord Jesus has come
in the form of your father.

1491
01:24:24,916 --> 01:24:25,791
Sorry.

1492
01:24:26,791 --> 01:24:27,958
Is he a dumb fellow?

1493
01:24:28,208 --> 01:24:30,166
Is it enough to follow me all the time?

1494
01:24:30,333 --> 01:24:32,750
I am waiting for him to talk to me.

1495
01:24:34,041 --> 01:24:35,916
Ask him to meet me in the
book shop tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

1496
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
I will come there.

1497
01:24:39,166 --> 01:24:40,958
Even though the idea failed,

1498
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:42,750
but the result made you happy, right?

1499
01:24:42,833 --> 01:24:43,666
Thanks, buddy!

1500
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:45,750
Okay, dear.

1501
01:24:46,083 --> 01:24:50,833
Bro, don't ditch me just because
your problem got solved.

1502
01:24:51,625 --> 01:24:54,583
It is your duty to convince your sister.

1503
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:58,291
What a wonderful family!
Thank God I don't have a sister.

1504
01:25:07,375 --> 01:25:08,625
Go and talk to her.

1505
01:25:09,916 --> 01:25:11,625
You fell in love, right?

1506
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:14,458
You spoke to her family, right?
Go and speak to mom.

1507
01:25:14,541 --> 01:25:16,041
Why don't you talk?
I am scared.

1508
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:18,833
-I will talk later.
-Mom.

1509
01:25:21,083 --> 01:25:22,375
Anbu is in love with a girl.

1510
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:32,250
She was my colleague in my old office.

1511
01:25:37,958 --> 01:25:39,083
What are you saying?

1512
01:25:39,416 --> 01:25:40,666
What will our relative
think if we get him married

1513
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:43,291
to a girl from another caste.

1514
01:25:43,458 --> 01:25:46,041
Mom, why didn't you
bother about the relatives

1515
01:25:46,125 --> 01:25:47,875
when father was brutally attacked?

1516
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:50,541
You managed the entire house, right?

1517
01:25:50,875 --> 01:25:52,541
Are you trying to cool me down?

1518
01:25:54,958 --> 01:25:56,250
She is a divorcee as well.

1519
01:25:58,500 --> 01:25:59,875
Why are you talking like this, Mom?

1520
01:26:00,958 --> 01:26:02,375
They were not compatible enough.

1521
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,250
That's why they got divorced.

1522
01:26:04,958 --> 01:26:06,958
What would you have done if
you were in her place?

1523
01:26:08,666 --> 01:26:10,791
Leave all that.

1524
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:12,750
Anbu liked her.

1525
01:26:13,458 --> 01:26:16,625
He worked, paid all the debts,
and got me educated.

1526
01:26:16,708 --> 01:26:19,375
Our family is leading a decent life

1527
01:26:20,083 --> 01:26:21,500
only because of his hard work.

1528
01:26:22,583 --> 01:26:24,250
Has he done anything for himself?

1529
01:26:24,666 --> 01:26:26,875
This is the only thing
he has ever asked for.

1530
01:26:28,666 --> 01:26:31,375
Can't we fulfill his wish?

1531
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:33,666
Please think about him, Mom.

1532
01:26:34,416 --> 01:26:35,541
She is a good girl.

1533
01:26:37,083 --> 01:26:38,333
You'll definitely like her.

1534
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,375
If she becomes my sister-in-law,

1535
01:26:42,875 --> 01:26:45,708
we will always be united.

1536
01:26:47,625 --> 01:26:48,750
Please, Mom!

1537
01:27:12,041 --> 01:27:14,666
<i>Shall I give my heart to you?</i>

1538
01:27:15,458 --> 01:27:18,000
<i>Shall I touch that without breaking?</i>

1539
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:21,083
<i>Let us forget our sorrows</i>

1540
01:27:21,166 --> 01:27:22,833
<i>Let us fly high slowly</i>

1541
01:27:22,916 --> 01:27:25,333
<i>The heart is light like feathers</i>

1542
01:27:28,416 --> 01:27:29,541
He is proud about it.

1543
01:27:31,416 --> 01:27:32,333
She is inside.

1544
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:34,625
I brought her to introduce Jenny.

1545
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:36,041
What are you going to do?

1546
01:27:43,916 --> 01:27:44,916
I'll take a leave.

1547
01:27:46,041 --> 01:27:47,458
Aruna, wait a minute.

1548
01:27:48,041 --> 01:27:50,291
Why are you behaving in this manner?
Listen to me!

1549
01:27:53,541 --> 01:27:54,875
I'm talking to you.

1550
01:27:58,375 --> 01:27:59,291
Aruna!

1551
01:28:09,166 --> 01:28:11,000
<i>I am angry but…</i>

1552
01:28:21,208 --> 01:28:22,541
Bro, get up.

1553
01:28:25,875 --> 01:28:29,500
<i>I understood the value</i>

1554
01:28:29,583 --> 01:28:32,541
<i>Of relationship because of you</i>

1555
01:28:32,625 --> 01:28:35,875
<i>We will bear the memories</i>

1556
01:28:35,958 --> 01:28:39,333
<i>And travel a long distance</i>

1557
01:28:39,416 --> 01:28:42,750
<i>Life is a mystery</i>

1558
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:46,125
<i>It changes every time</i>

1559
01:28:46,375 --> 01:28:49,583
<i>We will scale new heights</i>

1560
01:28:49,666 --> 01:28:52,875
<i>Forgetting this world</i>

1561
01:29:20,833 --> 01:29:23,166
<i>We will not be sad anymore</i>

1562
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:26,375
<i>The fog will not last long</i>

1563
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:29,916
<i>It will disappear with the wind</i>

1564
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,333
<i>Sorrows will disappear as well</i>

1565
01:29:34,333 --> 01:29:39,958
<i>Water has to come to reach the ocean</i>

1566
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:47,000
<i>Come and save me like a friend when I fall</i>

1567
01:29:47,708 --> 01:29:50,750
<i>When we cry</i>

1568
01:29:50,833 --> 01:29:54,291
<i>The eye don't know about it</i>

1569
01:29:54,375 --> 01:29:57,833
<i>When I walk with you</i>
<i>I don't feel any pain</i>

1570
01:29:57,916 --> 01:30:00,666
<i>I don't want anything more</i>

1571
01:30:01,458 --> 01:30:04,500
<i>How many times have we cried?</i>

1572
01:30:04,583 --> 01:30:07,833
<i>How many times have we forgotten that?</i>

1573
01:30:08,166 --> 01:30:11,833
<i>It is not trivial to care</i>
<i>Everything is no at peak</i>

1574
01:30:11,916 --> 01:30:14,750
<i>We would have enjoyed the minutes</i>

1575
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:18,333
<i>I understood the value</i>

1576
01:30:18,541 --> 01:30:21,500
<i>Of relationship because of you</i>

1577
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:24,791
<i>We will bear the memories</i>

1578
01:30:24,875 --> 01:30:28,375
<i>And travel a long distance</i>

1579
01:30:28,458 --> 01:30:34,625
<i>This life is a mystery</i>
<i>Which transforms on its own</i>

1580
01:30:35,041 --> 01:30:41,666
<i>The light of love</i>
<i>Blends with day and night</i>

1581
01:30:43,083 --> 01:30:44,625
Why do they cut the power
supply on Friday morning?

1582
01:30:44,708 --> 01:30:45,583
Mom!

1583
01:30:46,125 --> 01:30:47,583
I want to tell you something.

1584
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:49,750
Tell me quickly.
I have a lot of work to do.

1585
01:30:50,875 --> 01:30:52,875
Anbu's family is very good.

1586
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:55,083
Who?

1587
01:30:55,375 --> 01:30:58,250
Are they the ones who rejected you?

1588
01:31:00,666 --> 01:31:02,291
How does that matter to us?

1589
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:04,250
Anbu is getting married!

1590
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:06,375
He wants to give us an invitation.

1591
01:31:07,041 --> 01:31:08,375
How are you related to them?

1592
01:31:08,458 --> 01:31:09,875
Who sent the message through you?

1593
01:31:10,291 --> 01:31:13,541
Anbu's brother, Arivu…

1594
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
He is in love with me.

1595
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:19,833
He wants to marry me.

1596
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,250
What are you saying?

1597
01:31:26,708 --> 01:31:28,000
Mrs. Laxmi!

1598
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:30,750
Mrs. Laxmi, please take the flowers.

1599
01:31:37,541 --> 01:31:38,583
Come.

1600
01:31:39,583 --> 01:31:41,416
You are my first customer today.

1601
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:43,208
You look like Goddess Laxmi.

1602
01:31:43,291 --> 01:31:45,041
I am going to have a good day today.

1603
01:31:45,125 --> 01:31:46,458
I will take your leave now.

1604
01:31:53,916 --> 01:31:55,875
I didn't do this for money.

1605
01:31:55,958 --> 01:31:57,250
Keep it.

1606
01:31:58,791 --> 01:32:00,000
Okay. I am coming there.

1607
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:01,958
The cow in my friend's
house has yielded a calf.

1608
01:32:02,041 --> 01:32:03,125
I am going there.

1609
01:32:04,333 --> 01:32:05,875
Wait a minute. I will be back.

1610
01:32:08,833 --> 01:32:09,916
Okay!

1611
01:32:13,041 --> 01:32:15,541
What are you saying?

1612
01:32:15,625 --> 01:32:17,833
Arivu is a very good boy.

1613
01:32:18,166 --> 01:32:20,250
He has a good job and is earning well.

1614
01:32:20,333 --> 01:32:21,875
He is a suitable match for Aruna.

1615
01:32:22,166 --> 01:32:23,791
Both of them like each other.

1616
01:32:25,625 --> 01:32:29,666
Dad will find someone
who matches our status.

1617
01:32:30,291 --> 01:32:33,166
Arivu and his mother are
coming to give us the invitation.

1618
01:32:33,666 --> 01:32:35,583
Use this opportunity well.

1619
01:32:36,291 --> 01:32:38,958
You can tell father that
he looks like a decent guy

1620
01:32:39,041 --> 01:32:40,666
and we can get him married to Aruna.

1621
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:49,291
Get me the horoscope.

1622
01:32:49,375 --> 01:32:50,958
I will decide only after seeing that.

1623
01:33:06,583 --> 01:33:07,625
Welcome.

1624
01:33:07,916 --> 01:33:11,000
-Greetings. Please come.
-Greetings.

1625
01:33:14,166 --> 01:33:15,625
Please sit.

1626
01:33:19,625 --> 01:33:21,083
-Are you fine?
-Yes, I am fine.

1627
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:32,708
-Aruna, prepare tea for them.
-Okay, Mom.

1628
01:33:35,041 --> 01:33:36,958
-Senthil, I will be back.
-Okay, Mom.

1629
01:33:38,541 --> 01:33:40,541
Why are they here?

1630
01:33:40,958 --> 01:33:42,833
Their son, Anbu is getting married.

1631
01:33:42,916 --> 01:33:44,458
They have come to invite us.

1632
01:33:44,916 --> 01:33:47,250
Have they come to
invite us after insulting us?

1633
01:33:47,458 --> 01:33:49,291
You are also encouraging them.

1634
01:33:49,666 --> 01:33:51,375
What else do you want me to do?

1635
01:33:51,458 --> 01:33:54,750
-Why don't you talk to them?
-Are you mad?

1636
01:33:56,291 --> 01:33:57,458
Please come.

1637
01:33:57,541 --> 01:34:00,125
They have forgotten
everything and come to our house.

1638
01:34:00,208 --> 01:34:01,500
Why are you still thinking about the past?

1639
01:34:01,583 --> 01:34:03,583
Please come. Get up.

1640
01:34:14,041 --> 01:34:16,125
He is the younger son, Arivu.

1641
01:34:16,208 --> 01:34:17,916
He is working in an IT company.

1642
01:34:18,458 --> 01:34:20,291
I apologize for whatever happened, Uncle.

1643
01:34:20,541 --> 01:34:23,458
Neither of us are at fault.

1644
01:34:23,833 --> 01:34:26,416
The prank call was the
reason for everything.

1645
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,750
Please forget the past.

1646
01:34:29,416 --> 01:34:30,666
Mom, give the invitation.

1647
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:39,375
-Our elder son is getting married.
-Great.

1648
01:34:39,541 --> 01:34:40,541
Please don't come.

1649
01:34:45,416 --> 01:34:47,833
-Mom, what are you doing?
-Look at my daughter-in-law.

1650
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:49,458
What did you say the other day?

1651
01:34:49,541 --> 01:34:51,958
You cursed that my son
will never get married.

1652
01:34:52,291 --> 01:34:54,291
You asked me as to
who will marry him, right?

1653
01:34:54,375 --> 01:34:55,833
She is going to be my daughter-in-law.

1654
01:34:55,916 --> 01:34:57,708
-Your daughter isn't that great.
-Hey!

1655
01:34:57,958 --> 01:34:59,041
Keep quiet.

1656
01:34:59,416 --> 01:35:02,208
They beat my son and insulted
our family in front of everyone.

1657
01:35:02,291 --> 01:35:04,083
-Why should I personally invite them?
-Hey!

1658
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:06,125
-Mom, please keep quiet.
-Mind your words.

1659
01:35:06,375 --> 01:35:08,625
My son is getting married on the 24th.

1660
01:35:08,708 --> 01:35:10,208
Your daughter is still unmarried.

1661
01:35:10,708 --> 01:35:13,250
-Your daughter will elope with someone.
-Hey!

1662
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:53,500
You created a ruckus the other day
at his house.

1663
01:35:53,666 --> 01:35:55,833
And today she was insulting my daughter.

1664
01:35:56,208 --> 01:35:58,958
You couldn't tell her anything but
you were trying to control me instead.

1665
01:35:59,041 --> 01:36:01,583
This stupid woman was
offering coffee to them.

1666
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,916
The guy from Aathur was
asking about our daughter.

1667
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,458
I am going to accept the proposal.

1668
01:36:05,541 --> 01:36:09,416
I will get my daughter married
before his son.

1669
01:36:11,708 --> 01:36:13,333
I will handle the situation!

1670
01:36:43,583 --> 01:36:46,583
Hey, why don't you both elope
and get married?

1671
01:36:46,666 --> 01:36:47,583
What are you saying?

1672
01:36:47,708 --> 01:36:48,875
Did I say something wrong?

1673
01:36:49,916 --> 01:36:51,625
Don't act like a fool!

1674
01:36:51,708 --> 01:36:52,791
We can't run away from the situation.

1675
01:36:52,875 --> 01:36:54,666
Will you do it after your marriage?

1676
01:36:55,125 --> 01:36:58,208
Do you think dad will
let it go that easily?

1677
01:36:59,458 --> 01:37:01,458
What if it lands us at the police station?

1678
01:37:01,625 --> 01:37:03,541
That will ruin Anbu and Kayal's wedding.

1679
01:37:05,541 --> 01:37:06,708
Listen to me.

1680
01:37:07,041 --> 01:37:08,375
I don't know what you will do.

1681
01:37:09,125 --> 01:37:12,750
I will wait for you till the
last minute of the wedding.

1682
01:37:16,041 --> 01:37:17,041
I trust you.

1683
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:03,791
Two days are left for the wedding.

1684
01:38:04,458 --> 01:38:05,416
What should we do?

1685
01:38:06,125 --> 01:38:08,166
That is why I gave you
an idea the other day.

1686
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:09,875
-You didn't listen to me.
-Buddy.

1687
01:38:11,333 --> 01:38:13,291
Postpone everything
till Anbu gets married.

1688
01:38:14,208 --> 01:38:15,458
We can find a way later.

1689
01:38:21,625 --> 01:38:23,458
Do you have Aruna's alliance's number?

1690
01:38:23,583 --> 01:38:24,750
What happened?

1691
01:38:31,250 --> 01:38:32,625
You are Aruna's brother, right?

1692
01:38:33,125 --> 01:38:35,750
Useless fellow.
Give me your phone.

1693
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,375
I forgot my phone.

1694
01:38:39,750 --> 01:38:41,458
Why don't you call from your mobile phone?

1695
01:38:45,166 --> 01:38:46,166
Tell me, Venu.

1696
01:38:46,291 --> 01:38:48,250
<i>We are taking over a new project.</i>

1697
01:38:48,333 --> 01:38:50,375
-<i>We can't extend your leave anymore.</i>
-Okay.

1698
01:38:50,458 --> 01:38:51,666
I will be back soon.

1699
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:53,166
<i>You are the project head.</i>

1700
01:38:53,416 --> 01:38:55,083
Come back at the earliest.

1701
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:56,958
Okay, Venu, I will come.

1702
01:38:57,916 --> 01:38:59,125
Trying to act smart?

1703
01:38:59,208 --> 01:39:01,041
You will get stuck in a problem now.

1704
01:39:06,166 --> 01:39:08,083
-Hello! Is it Rajesh?
-<i>Hello.</i>

1705
01:39:08,375 --> 01:39:10,708
-Yes. Who is speaking?
-Sir.

1706
01:39:10,958 --> 01:39:12,500
You are going to get
married to Aruna, right?

1707
01:39:12,583 --> 01:39:14,416
Yes. What do you want to do about it?

1708
01:39:14,708 --> 01:39:17,041
Sir, Aruna and I love each other.

1709
01:39:17,125 --> 01:39:18,125
Nonsense!

1710
01:39:18,208 --> 01:39:20,208
What? Do you love each other?

1711
01:39:20,375 --> 01:39:21,916
Please understand.

1712
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,208
What do you want me to understand?

1713
01:39:23,291 --> 01:39:25,791
Why should they fix the
wedding within two weeks?

1714
01:39:25,875 --> 01:39:27,583
Think about that.

1715
01:39:27,833 --> 01:39:31,125
Do you know that Aruna's marriage
got canceled before this as well.

1716
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:34,166
You must reject the proposal.

1717
01:39:34,250 --> 01:39:35,750
Her brother is a mad fellow.

1718
01:39:35,833 --> 01:39:38,000
-He does foolish things.
-He is right.

1719
01:39:38,083 --> 01:39:40,083
<i>We have done everything, sir.</i>

1720
01:39:40,208 --> 01:39:41,708
What do you mean?

1721
01:39:41,875 --> 01:39:43,416
We have always been close.

1722
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:44,916
One and half years of love!

1723
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,250
We have been to Ooty and Kodaikanal.

1724
01:39:47,541 --> 01:39:48,708
We didn't even take a sweater.

1725
01:39:48,791 --> 01:39:50,041
Why don't you understand.

1726
01:39:51,083 --> 01:39:52,291
Over!

1727
01:39:54,375 --> 01:39:56,291
Is that how you spoke to Anbu as well?

1728
01:39:56,541 --> 01:39:59,125
I didn't talk much as you were here.

1729
01:39:59,208 --> 01:40:02,000
You can get anyone's marriage canceled.

1730
01:40:02,375 --> 01:40:04,416
Why don't you take
this as the main business?

1731
01:40:04,875 --> 01:40:05,708
It will be good.

1732
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:06,625
-Sorry.
-Why?

1733
01:40:06,708 --> 01:40:08,250
Only service. No business.

1734
01:40:08,333 --> 01:40:09,458
Good.

1735
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:16,583
-Tell me, sir.
-To heck with you!

1736
01:40:17,416 --> 01:40:19,625
I knew something was fishy when you
wanted to get the marriage done soon.

1737
01:40:19,708 --> 01:40:21,958
-That is when--
-Please let me talk, sir.

1738
01:40:22,041 --> 01:40:24,708
Are you planning to get my
son married to your daughter?

1739
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:25,958
Wait a minute.

1740
01:40:26,208 --> 01:40:27,791
Did someone tell you something?

1741
01:40:27,958 --> 01:40:29,791
How does that matter?

1742
01:40:29,916 --> 01:40:32,000
Why will someone say something
if your daughter was good?

1743
01:40:32,083 --> 01:40:34,708
This marriage will not happen.
Put the phone down.

1744
01:40:34,791 --> 01:40:35,916
Dammit!

1745
01:40:39,916 --> 01:40:42,208
What happened?
Why are you so angry?

1746
01:40:42,291 --> 01:40:43,625
It's because of them.

1747
01:40:44,083 --> 01:40:45,541
They called this alliance as well.

1748
01:40:45,625 --> 01:40:48,000
The groom's father is
asking us to stop the marriage.

1749
01:40:48,583 --> 01:40:51,583
How will I face people if the
marriage gets called off again?

1750
01:40:52,541 --> 01:40:54,166
If we don't stop them,

1751
01:40:54,791 --> 01:40:56,541
they will continue doing this.

1752
01:40:57,208 --> 01:40:59,541
I will show them my true colors.

1753
01:41:07,791 --> 01:41:09,375
Why do you get tense?

1754
01:41:09,458 --> 01:41:12,166
I am worried about my daughter's wedding.

1755
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:13,833
Do you think this is unnecessary?

1756
01:41:13,916 --> 01:41:15,291
Do you think I am mad?

1757
01:41:18,875 --> 01:41:20,041
Ask your brother to come.

1758
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:36,375
Have your medicine.

1759
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,291
Sister, what happened?

1760
01:41:39,625 --> 01:41:40,625
Start the car.

1761
01:41:40,708 --> 01:41:41,666
-Hey.
-We will go to the hospital.

1762
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:43,791
It is not necessary.
He has high blood pressure.

1763
01:41:43,875 --> 01:41:45,041
He has taken medicines.

1764
01:41:45,166 --> 01:41:46,416
He will be alright soon.

1765
01:41:47,916 --> 01:41:48,916
Brother-in-law.

1766
01:41:56,666 --> 01:41:58,000
Tell me.

1767
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:01,541
They stopped Aruna's wedding.

1768
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:10,666
Why haven't they called yet?

1769
01:42:11,458 --> 01:42:12,583
Will our plan work?

1770
01:42:13,166 --> 01:42:14,083
Wait.

1771
01:42:14,666 --> 01:42:17,125
Both the families will blame each other

1772
01:42:17,208 --> 01:42:20,291
abuses each other and
then comes to a conclusion.

1773
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:22,083
Wait for some more time.
They will call.

1774
01:42:22,166 --> 01:42:23,375
Now that you have informed me,

1775
01:42:23,458 --> 01:42:25,083
you can get started with
the marriage preparations.

1776
01:42:25,166 --> 01:42:26,583
Marriage will happen.

1777
01:42:27,166 --> 01:42:28,958
I will handle the troublemakers.

1778
01:42:32,208 --> 01:42:33,500
Finally he got the call.

1779
01:42:33,583 --> 01:42:34,458
Tell me, Uncle.

1780
01:42:37,583 --> 01:42:38,666
Is everything okay?

1781
01:42:41,333 --> 01:42:42,916
-Everything is ruined.
-What happened?

1782
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,750
My dad ended up
telling everything to uncle.

1783
01:42:44,833 --> 01:42:46,916
He left to abduct the groom.

1784
01:42:47,625 --> 01:42:48,875
Not only that.

1785
01:42:48,958 --> 01:42:52,291
He is going to keep your
whole family in their custody.

1786
01:42:54,458 --> 01:42:55,541
Nothing can be done now.

1787
01:42:55,625 --> 01:42:57,041
Hey! Wait a minute.

1788
01:42:57,208 --> 01:42:58,416
Let us plan something.

1789
01:42:58,541 --> 01:43:00,250
That's what you have been saying.

1790
01:43:00,416 --> 01:43:02,208
You don't know anything about my uncle.

1791
01:43:02,541 --> 01:43:04,750
Hey! Is he equal to Arnold?

1792
01:43:06,083 --> 01:43:08,250
My buddy can fight with
any number of people.

1793
01:43:08,416 --> 01:43:09,500
Don't you know that?

1794
01:43:09,916 --> 01:43:11,500
Do you know my uncle's name?

1795
01:43:11,708 --> 01:43:12,875
Vagaiyara.

1796
01:43:12,958 --> 01:43:14,291
Do you know why he is named that?

1797
01:43:14,375 --> 01:43:15,666
Have you heard how people
are summoned at court?

1798
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:17,375
They address you by adding
Vagaiyara to your name.

1799
01:43:17,458 --> 01:43:19,083
That's how his name was derived.

1800
01:43:19,208 --> 01:43:20,750
He is famous in Dindigul.

1801
01:43:23,750 --> 01:43:26,083
Try to save yourself.

1802
01:43:34,916 --> 01:43:35,875
<i>Did you understand?</i>

1803
01:43:36,041 --> 01:43:39,833
<i>I tried to help my brother but</i>
<i>now it's become my problem.</i>

1804
01:43:40,208 --> 01:43:41,416
<i>I am being blamed for it.</i>

1805
01:43:58,875 --> 01:44:00,958
-Hey!
-Who are you all?

1806
01:44:01,041 --> 01:44:02,375
Come with us!

1807
01:44:19,833 --> 01:44:21,416
<i>My lover's marriage is happening tomorrow.</i>

1808
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:24,000
<i>My brother is getting</i>
<i>married in the next two days.</i>

1809
01:44:24,125 --> 01:44:26,291
<i>Her marriage should be stopped.</i>

1810
01:44:26,458 --> 01:44:28,791
<i>My brother's marriage should</i>
<i>happen without any hassle.</i>

1811
01:44:29,291 --> 01:44:32,166
<i>I should finish all this and go</i>
<i>back to Chennai next week.</i>

1812
01:44:32,333 --> 01:44:33,375
<i>How will it happen?</i>

1813
01:44:38,833 --> 01:44:39,958
-Hey.
-Uncle.

1814
01:44:40,041 --> 01:44:41,666
Both the families are under my custody.

1815
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:43,125
You need not worry.

1816
01:44:43,708 --> 01:44:44,833
The marriage will happen tomorrow morning.

1817
01:44:44,916 --> 01:44:46,083
Okay.

1818
01:44:56,333 --> 01:44:57,250
-Hey!
-Yes, sir.

1819
01:44:57,416 --> 01:44:58,666
Go and get the registrar.

1820
01:44:59,750 --> 01:45:02,416
Get the groom and his family ready.

1821
01:45:02,583 --> 01:45:04,708
-Bring them to the wedding hall.
-Okay.

1822
01:45:05,125 --> 01:45:07,291
Stay here and keep a watch on them.

1823
01:45:07,666 --> 01:45:08,708
-What?
-Okay, brother.

1824
01:45:08,833 --> 01:45:12,166
No one should until the marriage is over.

1825
01:45:12,708 --> 01:45:13,791
We will take care of it.

1826
01:45:13,875 --> 01:45:15,750
RAJESH WEDS ARUNA

1827
01:45:41,166 --> 01:45:43,083
Are you still sitting here?

1828
01:45:44,791 --> 01:45:47,291
Everyone is asking about you.
Please come.

1829
01:45:47,375 --> 01:45:48,750
Please go.

1830
01:45:49,041 --> 01:45:49,916
I will come.

1831
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,708
-The auspicious time will get over.
-Please go.

1832
01:45:51,791 --> 01:45:52,833
Uncle.

1833
01:45:53,375 --> 01:45:54,750
Is everything alright?

1834
01:45:54,833 --> 01:45:55,916
Don't be tense.

1835
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,750
I am handling everything well.

1836
01:45:57,916 --> 01:45:59,416
The groom's family is here.

1837
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:02,083
The groom and bride
are already on the stage.

1838
01:46:02,583 --> 01:46:04,333
What if they create a problem?

1839
01:46:05,083 --> 01:46:07,083
We will get insulted once again.

1840
01:46:07,166 --> 01:46:10,208
Uncle, I have locked the
entire family in the farmhouse.

1841
01:46:10,333 --> 01:46:12,000
People are guarding them as well.

1842
01:46:12,333 --> 01:46:14,541
Come and bless the couple.

1843
01:46:14,875 --> 01:46:17,500
Please come, Uncle.

1844
01:46:19,583 --> 01:46:20,458
Come with me.

1845
01:46:21,416 --> 01:46:25,500
-Welcome everybody.
-Please come.

1846
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:30,958
-What happened?
-Please hold him.

1847
01:46:31,083 --> 01:46:33,375
-Get up.
-It's nothing.

1848
01:46:33,458 --> 01:46:34,416
Don't get tense.

1849
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:35,583
He has blood pressure issues.

1850
01:46:35,666 --> 01:46:36,958
Have the tablet.

1851
01:46:37,041 --> 01:46:39,458
It's nothing. He is just worried
about the wedding.

1852
01:46:39,541 --> 01:46:42,333
He will be very happy
once the marriage is done.

1853
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:44,000
-Hey!
-What happened, Uncle?

1854
01:46:44,541 --> 01:46:47,416
He is getting tense.
Exchange the garland.

1855
01:46:49,166 --> 01:46:51,333
Yes, he is the one.
Wait a minute.

1856
01:46:51,416 --> 01:46:53,750
Do as I say!
Exchange the garland.

1857
01:46:54,958 --> 01:46:55,916
Oh, God!

1858
01:46:58,625 --> 01:46:59,875
He is not well.

1859
01:47:00,333 --> 01:47:03,666
-The groom is changed.
-I will take care of it.

1860
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:05,333
Oh, my God!

1861
01:47:05,416 --> 01:47:09,000
The marriage is done.
Why were you tense about it?

1862
01:47:20,333 --> 01:47:21,333
BRIDEGROOM INVITES RATHNAVEL, SUMATHI
BRIDE INVITES PONNUSWAMY, LAKSHMI

1863
01:47:21,416 --> 01:47:22,250
ALL ARE INVITED

1864
01:47:22,458 --> 01:47:23,625
You are a fool!

1865
01:47:23,708 --> 01:47:25,458
Uncle, there is a limit for everything.

1866
01:47:25,833 --> 01:47:27,791
I took a lot of trouble
to get this wedding done.

1867
01:47:27,875 --> 01:47:31,083
The one who spread
the rumors about Aruna

1868
01:47:31,208 --> 01:47:33,541
and the one who set all this up is him!

1869
01:47:38,791 --> 01:47:40,375
Please don't tell him anything.

1870
01:47:44,583 --> 01:47:47,416
I need the photos and
details of the groom's family.

1871
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:50,083
I also need the photo of the
people who are creating trouble.

1872
01:47:50,166 --> 01:47:52,833
Just give me the photos.
I will take care of the rest.

1873
01:47:54,958 --> 01:47:56,166
It is with Senthil.

1874
01:47:57,208 --> 01:47:58,291
Get it from him.

1875
01:48:00,208 --> 01:48:02,125
Try to save yourself.

1876
01:48:04,791 --> 01:48:07,250
Uncle is asking me to identify the groom.

1877
01:48:11,333 --> 01:48:13,583
Have you lost it?

1878
01:48:13,958 --> 01:48:16,791
So, your uncle doesn't
know the groom and his family.

1879
01:48:17,125 --> 01:48:18,708
He doesn't know me and my family.

1880
01:48:19,208 --> 01:48:22,000
Why don't you exchange
the photos and addresses

1881
01:48:22,083 --> 01:48:24,041
of the two families and give it to him?

1882
01:48:24,625 --> 01:48:25,541
Will this work out?

1883
01:48:25,833 --> 01:48:27,083
We will make this happen.

1884
01:48:27,791 --> 01:48:30,666
I heard that the groom is from Aathur.

1885
01:48:30,916 --> 01:48:33,458
My father might have blurted
because of high blood pressure.

1886
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,666
People from Aathur are creating trouble.

1887
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:37,375
He is Arivu.

1888
01:48:37,541 --> 01:48:40,541
The groom is Rajesh.

1889
01:48:42,333 --> 01:48:45,125
Send the photos to me.
I will take care of it.

1890
01:49:10,875 --> 01:49:13,625
Didn't I tell you that he
would get married before me?

1891
01:49:13,708 --> 01:49:16,583
I married the girl that
you selected for me.

1892
01:49:16,666 --> 01:49:20,750
I had a doubt when
you didn't go to Chennai.

1893
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,500
But I did not know that it was this girl.

1894
01:49:23,208 --> 01:49:25,750
Finally my elder son will
get married in two days.

1895
01:49:26,125 --> 01:49:27,875
I will be happy if this ends well.

1896
01:49:29,666 --> 01:49:32,666
LIFE TOGETHERNESS CEREMONY

1897
01:50:34,958 --> 01:50:37,291
{\an8}Wait a minute.
It seems to be a new number.

1898
01:50:38,041 --> 01:50:39,041
{\an8}Dude!

1899
01:50:39,125 --> 01:50:40,041
{\an8}Finally your marriage is arranged as well.

1900
01:50:40,125 --> 01:50:41,666
{\an8}-Are you sorry about it?
-No.

1901
01:50:41,750 --> 01:50:42,750
{\an8}I don't feel bad as well.

1902
01:50:42,833 --> 01:50:44,083
{\an8}Let it be.

1903
01:50:44,583 --> 01:50:45,791
{\an8}-Hello!
-<i>Hello.</i>

1904
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,250
{\an8}<i>Are you Durai Pandi?</i>

1905
01:50:47,333 --> 01:50:49,458
{\an8}Yes, I am Durai Pandi speaking.
Who are you?

1906
01:50:49,541 --> 01:50:53,583
{\an8}<i>Sir, Sangeetha and I love each other.</i>

1907
01:50:54,750 --> 01:50:55,791
{\an8}<i>Please don't cry.</i>

1908
01:50:55,916 --> 01:50:57,958
{\an8}-Are you messing with me?
-<i>What happened?</i>

1909
01:50:58,166 --> 01:51:01,083
{\an8}You would have been
in love for years, right?

1910
01:51:01,166 --> 01:51:02,041
{\an8}<i>Yes.</i>

1911
01:51:02,125 --> 01:51:03,875
{\an8}It would be better if I
reject the proposal, right?

1912
01:51:03,958 --> 01:51:04,791
{\an8}<i>Absolutely!</i>

1913
01:51:04,875 --> 01:51:06,541
{\an8}You might have traveled
together to Ooty and Kodaikanal.

1914
01:51:06,625 --> 01:51:07,458
{\an8}<i>How do you know?</i>

1915
01:51:07,541 --> 01:51:09,291
{\an8}You might have done everything.

1916
01:51:09,375 --> 01:51:10,708
{\an8}<i>Why do I feel like you were present there?</i>

1917
01:51:10,791 --> 01:51:13,416
{\an8}-Will you join in a video call?
-<i>Why?</i>

1918
01:51:13,541 --> 01:51:15,625
{\an8}I want to slap you.

1919
01:51:15,708 --> 01:51:17,333
{\an8}<i>Your mobile will be damaged.</i>

1920
01:51:17,416 --> 01:51:19,125
{\an8}Hey, you rascal!

1921
01:51:19,208 --> 01:51:21,208
{\an8}I will come along with my JCB

1922
01:51:21,291 --> 01:51:23,375
{\an8}and finish your entire family.

1923
01:51:23,541 --> 01:51:24,875
{\an8}-Hang up.
-<i>Okay!</i>

1924
01:51:26,375 --> 01:51:28,875
{\an8}We have prank called so many people.

1925
01:51:28,958 --> 01:51:30,708
{\an8}And now they are trying to play with me.

1926
01:51:30,791 --> 01:51:31,833
{\an8}-That day--
-Buddy.

1927
01:51:33,041 --> 01:51:34,708
{\an8}What if he is speaking the truth?

1928
01:51:36,625 --> 01:51:37,541
{\an8}That's possible.

1929
01:51:37,750 --> 01:51:39,000
{\an8}I also think the same.

1930
01:51:46,125 --> 01:51:49,083
{\an8}<i>I feel that they are trying to trick me.</i>

1931
01:51:49,458 --> 01:51:52,208
{\an8}The girl was talking over
the phone and eloped with him.

1932
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:56,750
{\an8}-Buddy, he is--
-Go and call him.

1933
01:51:56,833 --> 01:51:58,208
