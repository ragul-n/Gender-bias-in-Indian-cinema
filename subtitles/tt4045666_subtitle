''Friends, it belongs to eveyone.
It will mesmerize you.''

22
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:30,804
''lt will mesmerize you.''
- It is really wonderFul.

23
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:34,903

Oh, yes, thanks.

31
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:11,001
Hello, Twinkle.
l have arrived in Delhi.

32
00:04:11,165 --> 00:04:13,700
Listen to me, was my wallet
in the house?

33
00:04:14,432 --> 00:04:16,400
God! All my cards are
at home, too.

34
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:18,734
All the extra cash mom
gave me is in that, too.

35
00:04:19,532 --> 00:04:21,767
No, l have about six or seven
hundred rupees with me.

36
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,535
l will manage.
But, don't tell mom.

37
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,901
An_ay, l have to get back
on the evening flight.

38
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:30,601
Are you crazy?
l don't have any money.

39
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:32,467
Don't we have Haldiram's in Mumbai?

40
00:04:32,532 --> 00:04:33,699
Okay, bye.

41
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:35,233
Fine.

42
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:51,467
Excuse me, Uncle.
- Yes?

43
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:53,901
Any idea, what's the fare
to get to Vasant Kunj?

44
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:56,401
lt should be about two hundred
and fifty rupees, dear.

45
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:58,267
Two hundred and fifty?
Oh, no.

46
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:01,234
Why?
- Nothing, l mean, thanks.

47
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:05,501
Give me a hundred and twenty rupees.

48
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:07,499
Excuse me?

49
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:10,568
What? Don't get me into trouble!
l ride a three wheeler.

50
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:11,566
What?

51
00:05:11,632 --> 00:05:13,600
Look, my uniform is under this.

52
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:16,468
Rickshaws aren't allowed
at the airport.

53
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:18,033
That's why, l sneaked in.

54
00:05:18,265 --> 00:05:20,600
Anyway, this is for your benefit.

55
00:05:21,299 --> 00:05:22,400
How come?

56
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:24,533
Rambir!
- Yes.

57
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:27,134
How much to get to Vasant Kuni?

58
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:28,600
Two hundred and fifty rupees
without an AC.

59
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:30,734
Three hundred and thirty in
an AC car. - l see.

60
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,401
Listen, Ma'am, this is my bread
and butter.

61
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:37,400
Let me drop you.

62
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:53,499
Come on, buddy!
Get a move on.

63
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:55,600
What's wrong with you?
Get your hand off the horn.

64
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:58,001
Why don't you take it easy, Bhaiyya
(brother)? - What?

65
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:00,400
l could do that, ma'am.

66
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,568
But, l have to request you
not to call me Bhaiwa.

67
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:09,035
Jolly Bijnori is my name,
from Bijnor!

68
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:12,302
You can call me Jolly!

69
00:06:15,232 --> 00:06:17,867
You are pretty awesome!
- What?

70
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:20,135
l mean, from the heart!

71
00:06:20,532 --> 00:06:21,933
You have it.

72
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,233
lt's totally full!

73
00:06:24,566 --> 00:06:26,301
lt's all about heart.

74
00:06:26,366 --> 00:06:28,167
Ma'am, you're from Mumbai, right?

75
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:32,303
l used to drive in Andheri,
in Mumbai. For two years.

76
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:35,635
But, you know, things are more
expensive there.

77
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:38,867
Are you a leading lady?
- No!

78
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,267
You could be one, if you tried.

79
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:43,601
Jolly Bijnor can tell
the future, accurately.

80
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,035
Why don't you keep your eyes
on the road? - What?

81
00:06:46,432 --> 00:06:48,467
l'm boring you?
- What?

82
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,935
l failed the seventh grade, Ma'am!

83
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:56,934
l scored twenty in my English exam.

84
00:06:57,165 --> 00:07:00,735
But, l failed all because of
these parks.

85
00:07:01,232 --> 00:07:04,401
l used to sit with my girlfriend
there, all the time.

86
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,234
l didn't study, one little bit.

87
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:09,434
Ma'am, the parks are slightly safer.

88
00:07:09,532 --> 00:07:11,934
You pay a little money
and no one hassles you.

89
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,601
l mean,
you can easily kiss and pet.

90
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:16,700
How much longer will it take?

91
00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:20,236
You are almost here.
It's on the other side of that turn.

92
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:22,500
l am sure, you have one.

93
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,601
What?
- A BF. A boy to kiss and pet.

94
00:07:25,766 --> 00:07:26,967
Pull over.
- What?

95
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:28,834
Pull over to the side of the road.
- Sure, l'll stop. What is it?

96
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:31,635
l'll tell you. Pull over.
Stop the rickshaw. - What?

97
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:33,834
l'm doing it, why are you
shouting at me?

98
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,100
Do you want to get slapped?

99
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,501
Don't act too smart!
Or l'll slap you so hard...

100
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:40,501
Ma'am, what is the matter?

101
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:41,967
What are you getting so upset about?

102
00:07:42,032 --> 00:07:43,733
Just you wait,
l'll teach you a lesson.

103
00:07:43,866 --> 00:07:46,768
Help! Help!

104
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,100
Sir.

105
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,467
Look, this auto driver
is troubling me since long time.

106
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:54,236
Hey, you!
Where are you going you rascal?

107
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,869
Hey, rickshaw! My phone!
Just stop it.

108
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:04,067
Rickshaw!

109
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:06,200
Darn it!

110
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:14,767
Hey, stop!
- Oh!

111
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:16,200
Are you crazy?

112
00:08:16,532 --> 00:08:18,800
Follow that rickshaw!
Please! - What?

113
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:21,001
l left my cell phone in the rickshaw.
- What should l do, then?

114
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:22,600
He will leave! Please, let's go.

115
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:23,767
Are you insane?

116
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:25,267
Don't you Delhi folks
have any kind of decency?

117
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:27,668
Hello, forget about courtesy
and decency!

118
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:29,868
lf you cared so much,
you should take care of your phone.

119
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:33,836
What a lousy man! You won't help me!
In fact, you're dispensing wisdom!

120
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,403
l beg you! Don't you know how
it is to lose a phone? Please!

121
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,067
Okay, sit!
Hury up.

122
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:43,367
Let's go!
Quickly!

123
00:08:43,466 --> 00:08:46,101
Yes.
- Hury up! He's going to get away.

124
00:08:46,165 --> 00:08:47,432
Sure.

125
00:08:47,632 --> 00:08:50,368
Hury up! - What are you going
on about? Get off!

126
00:08:50,966 --> 00:08:52,467
What?
- Get off!

127
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,268
What is it, now?
- Push the bike.

128
00:08:57,632 --> 00:08:59,734
What?
- You have to push the bike.

129
00:09:00,065 --> 00:09:01,099
What?

130
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:03,033
The bike has a mind of its own.

131
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:05,301
lf you want to follow the rickshaw,
you have to push.

132
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:08,134
Oh God!

133
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:13,266
Come on, let's go.

134
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:15,867
Yes, push faster.

135
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:19,769
Put some more elbow into it!
Well done!

136
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:24,699
Come on!

137
00:09:31,265 --> 00:09:32,366
There he is!

138
00:09:34,099 --> 00:09:35,166
There he is!

139
00:09:47,032 --> 00:09:48,433
Yes, l'm stopping.

140
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:50,299
Hey!

141
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:53,332
Hey!

142
00:09:56,232 --> 00:09:57,333
What the...

143
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,901
Why did he stop us? - He had to,
since l jumped a red light.

144
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,368
Oh, God! But, my cell phone!

145
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:03,534
Okay, listen, is he coming?

146
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,967
He's coming here.

147
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,100
Does he have the parking
ticket book with him?

148
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:12,534
Yes, he has it!
But, why don't you move?

149
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:14,634
Hail the Divine Mother!

150
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:15,934
Hey, wait!

151
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:29,333
Which way?

152
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:31,701
Who would l know?

153
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:37,466
He got away!

154
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,134
lt's all your fault!

155
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:42,099
What?

156
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:44,334
l would have saved my cell phone
if your bike was working properly.

157
00:10:44,432 --> 00:10:47,568
And if you were sane,
l would be saved.

158
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:49,733
You've driven me crazy
within a moment.

159
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,001
l jumped a red light, all
because of you!

160
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:54,201
lt's the first time
l ran from a cop.

161
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,801
Shame on you!
At least admit you are wrong. Fool!

162
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:58,433
What?

163
00:10:58,632 --> 00:11:02,402
What the heck!
It's a crime to help someone, now.

164
00:11:02,632 --> 00:11:04,033
Can l use your phone?

165
00:11:04,866 --> 00:11:06,867
What?
- Give me your phone.

166
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:10,402
Hey!
What is with all this attitude?

167
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:13,701
l mean, l will give you my phone,
which will help you. Right?

168
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,602
l mean, you should help you
and you still give me attitude.

169
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,868
Listen, don't abuse me.

170
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:20,067
Alright. Fine!

171
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,101
Can l please, use your phone?

172
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:25,567
Make it fast.

173
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:27,600
Fast.

174
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:37,101
Hello, Mom.
It's me.

175
00:11:37,532 --> 00:11:40,568
Listen, l lost my cell phone.

176
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,234
l left it in the rickshaw.

177
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:44,100
lt's someone's cell phone.

178
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:47,902
Yes, l am irresponsible!
Why are you getting me married?

179
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:49,866
You are forcing me to
meet the boy.

180
00:11:49,966 --> 00:11:52,635
l don't want to meet the boy.
- Excuse me!

181
00:11:53,966 --> 00:11:55,567
What...
- l didn't lose the phone on purpose.

182
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,368
The rickshaw driver misbehaved
so we got into a fight.

183
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:02,535
Oh, God! How would l know
why eveyone misbehaves with me?

184
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,501
l am not shouting!

185
00:12:07,099 --> 00:12:10,001
Okay. Send me the number
and address of the boy...

186
00:12:10,065 --> 00:12:12,367
...from Twinkle's cell phone
to this phone.

187
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,167
lt belongs to someone else.

188
00:12:14,532 --> 00:12:15,699
Okay, bye.

189
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,035
You can't make such a long
call on someone else's cell phone.

190
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:25,400
l'll pay you for it.

191
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:28,435
Your parents didn't teach
you any manners, right?

192
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:31,268
Be quiet, if you can't thank me.

193
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:33,334
Please,
l am already hassled as it is.

194
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:35,100
Don't bug me anymore.

195
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:37,300
Thank you vey much.
You may leave now.

196
00:12:37,366 --> 00:12:39,868
Hey, l live in this city!

197
00:12:41,432 --> 00:12:42,766
l won't leave.

198
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,367
Forgive me, Mr. Delhi.

199
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:52,733
God!

200
00:13:07,032 --> 00:13:08,933
You won't get a rickshaw here.

201
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:13,034
You're hounding me, buddy!
Go on, leave.

202
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:16,135
You've received a message.
Do you want it? Or do l delete it?

203
00:13:16,265 --> 00:13:18,500
Oh, thanks.

204
00:13:20,165 --> 00:13:22,233
One moment, l'll write it down.

205
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:26,002
Why? Now the boys in
Delhi are good enough, are they?

206
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:27,834
Did l say they aren't good?

207
00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:32,967
Where is Vasant Kuni?

208
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:35,934
Get on the bike.
l'm going that way, l'll drop you.

209
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,603
There you go again.
Just because l spoke nicely...

210
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,300
...you are flirting with me.

211
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,467
What? Flirt?

212
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,035
l am flirting with you?

213
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:50,267
Please, get over yourself.

214
00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:53,736
Thanks to boys like you, boys in the
city are infamous the world over.

215
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:55,967
Hail the Divine Mother!
Who do you think you are?

216
00:13:56,032 --> 00:13:58,968
Hey, hello!
Buddy, what is wrong with you?

217
00:14:01,265 --> 00:14:02,265
Mumbai!

218
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:05,668
l knew it, you are a girl
from Mumbai!

219
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:07,334
What?
- What about it?

220
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,567
l didn't tell you to stop me
and ask for a lift.

221
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:11,100
You're really piling on!

222
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:15,402
lf you were a boy, l'd slap some
sense into you! - What?

223
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:18,334
You're tying to hook up with me,
using the phone as an excuse.

224
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:20,634
Hook up with you?
You need a reality check.

225
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:21,966
Well, it's way better
than your reality.

226
00:14:22,032 --> 00:14:24,300
Why don't you just leave?
What would that take?

227
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,334
You don't have anything
to offer me, anyway!

228
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,033
God knows, what she is made of!

229
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:29,867
Bitter gourd!
- It's evident!

230
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:31,500
Wretched Delhi boy!
- Hey, you!

231
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:34,802
And l don't care about your
opinion about Delhi boys!

232
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:39,936
Hey, you! Listen to me!
Don't abuse me, okay?

233
00:14:40,032 --> 00:14:42,534
Helping is a verb.
- Listen... - You listen, okay?

234
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:46,503
lt's not as if Delhi is short of
girls. l won't fall for you.

235
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:49,101
l am really going there.
Since you were hassled...

236
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,601
...the human in me said,
l should help you.

237
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:54,468
l swear, this is what we call
as values.

238
00:14:54,766 --> 00:14:57,535
These days, it's vey difficult
to arouse the inner human.

239
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,702
Another thing, if anyone finds out
you're new to Delhi...

240
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:03,001
...they will have you running
around in circles, all day.

241
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:05,367
And you won't even know it!
Get that?

242
00:15:23,566 --> 00:15:26,235
What is it?
- Let's go.

243
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:28,801
What?
- Let's go.

244
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:32,165
Sit.

245
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:52,800
Get off the bike.

246
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:55,100
What is it, now?

247
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:59,635
Push the bike. Again.

248
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:03,433
Oh God!

249
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,701
What is it?
- The light broke!

250
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:14,867
What?

251
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:19,768
What? You've cost me one hundred
and eighty rupees!

252
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:21,467
Can't you push right?
- Excuse me!

253
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:24,302
l didn't pursue a course,
that teaches you to push a bike!

254
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:27,502
Get it? - You did learn how
to say sory, right? Or didn't you?

255
00:16:34,065 --> 00:16:35,065
Let's go.

256
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:42,169
Come on, push.
Go on, that's it.

257
00:16:42,232 --> 00:16:44,367
Come on, come on!
Push, yes!

258
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:56,900
Don't you wear a helmet?

259
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,767
A helmet?

260
00:17:00,065 --> 00:17:03,201
lt's an attitude, girl!
It's what makes the man!

261
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,202
You'll know, when the police
slap you with a fine.

262
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:09,702
The policemen here salute me,
they don't slap fines on me.

263
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,300
Your silencer is on the blink, too.

264
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,233
lt's not on the blink it.
l got it removed.

265
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:16,533
lt's too noisy.

266
00:17:17,065 --> 00:17:19,834
People can tell l'm coming
from a kilometer away.

267
00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:22,268
Tiger Goli Kohli is in the locality!

268
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:24,367
This is attitude.

269
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,500
Goli (bullet).
- That's my name.

270
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:28,100
So funny.

271
00:17:28,165 --> 00:17:29,933
lt's my attitude, alright.

272
00:17:30,499 --> 00:17:32,601
Hey, wait. Stop right there.
- What is it?

273
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:35,368
Take it to the right, please.
- What is this?

274
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,200
Vasant Kunj police station.
- So what?

275
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,034
l will file a complaint
about my phone.

276
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:50,099
Thanks.

277
00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:52,801
As if the Delhi police has
nothing better to do!

278
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:58,367
You never get back time that
is past and a lost cell phone.

279
00:17:58,432 --> 00:18:01,568
So be it!
But, you have to file a complaint.

280
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:03,301
Someone may misuse it.

281
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:05,400
There are certain rules, you know.

282
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:07,867
You have loads of rules, right?

283
00:18:08,366 --> 00:18:10,801
There should be.
- Well, l don't have any.

284
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:13,100
Then, you should have some!

285
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:20,100
Listen to me.

286
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:23,199
Come on.

287
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:25,033
Where are you going?

288
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,901
To the police station to help you.

289
00:18:30,332 --> 00:18:31,766
l didn't ask for your help.

290
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,001
Delhi folks can help,
without being asked.

291
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:35,900
Thank you so much, but
l will manage.

292
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,267
Then, manage it!

293
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,234
Should l stay or leave?

294
00:18:39,432 --> 00:18:41,867
Why?
Don't you have anything else to do?

295
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,200
Alright, what do l care?

296
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,267
'She's acting smart# 

297
00:18:55,933 --> 00:18:58,769
'But nobody could escape
from my style# 

298
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:02,969
'She will surely
turn back and look at you# 

299
00:19:03,466 --> 00:19:04,834
Turn around.

300
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:08,600
Turn around.

301
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,733
Turn around.

302
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:14,867
You turn around.
- Hey!

303
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:18,135
Which model did you say it was?
- Blackbery Curve.

304
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,101
With the bill, or without the bill?
- With the bill.

305
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:28,165
Sory.

306
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,300
Sir, my girlfriend's cell phone
was stolen.

307
00:19:32,366 --> 00:19:34,901
l was chasing a thief and
you thought, l am running from you.

308
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:36,266
Still, let me say sory, Sir.

309
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:38,100
Tell me, Sir. Do you want me
to seek your blessings?

310
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:40,267
Your silencer isn't working.

311
00:19:41,065 --> 00:19:42,933
That got messed up on the way!

312
00:19:43,065 --> 00:19:44,566
The fact is that, Sir...
- Hey!

313
00:19:44,632 --> 00:19:46,000
Stand straight.
- Sory.

314
00:19:46,232 --> 00:19:49,001
Sir, l was going to repair
my silencer. The phone was stolen.

315
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:52,635
l see. So, the cell phone was
stolen. - l'm sory.

316
00:19:52,866 --> 00:19:54,867
Tell me your name.
- Forgive me. - Hey.

317
00:19:54,966 --> 00:19:57,568
Mr. Attitude,
what kind of attitude is this?

318
00:19:58,165 --> 00:20:01,301
Sir, what's the matter?
He's a vey decent man.

319
00:20:02,032 --> 00:20:03,133
Who are you?

320
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:06,101
Sir! She's the one,
whose cell phone was stolen.

321
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:07,900
l was helping her out.
Ask her.

322
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:09,466
ls she your girlfriend?

323
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:13,867
ls he your bo_riend?

324
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:20,400
Not at all.
- Hey!

325
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:26,002
You lie about evemhing.
- Sir, it's not a lie.

326
00:20:26,532 --> 00:20:28,533
He did help me.
-Yes.

327
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:31,100
He's a vey helpful guy.
- Yes.

328
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:36,771
But, the fact, if you wear a helmet
on a bike, it's safe for you.

329
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:40,636
What? - And, l asked you.
What did you say?

330
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,235
The cops salute you.
Yes, something to that effect.

331
00:20:47,332 --> 00:20:50,535
When l asked you, about your silencer
what did you say?

332
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:55,601
Attitude! That's right.
- Attitude, is it?

333
00:20:57,099 --> 00:20:58,467
Attitude.

334
00:20:59,165 --> 00:21:03,702
You pay the fine.
Sir, let him go, if you can.

335
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:05,799
Please let me go.

336
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:07,734
But you have to fine him, too.

337
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,602
Otherwise, others will get spoilt
by seeing him.

338
00:21:11,065 --> 00:21:13,367
Who knows what kind
of attitude he has?

339
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:16,767
Okay, then.
Thank you for your help.

340
00:21:18,566 --> 00:21:19,733
Have a good day, Sir.

341
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:25,767
Hey, you!
Hey!

342
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,602
Hey!
- Come on. Tell me your dad's name.

343
00:21:30,632 --> 00:21:32,100
Mr. G. S. Kohli.

344
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:34,467
G. S. Kohli.

345
00:21:36,232 --> 00:21:37,700
J
At least write mister
before his name.

346
00:21:37,766 --> 00:21:40,101
Pay me seven hundred rupees.
- Seven hundred rupees?

347
00:21:47,032 --> 00:21:48,500
Ma'am, this is Vasant Kuni.

348
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:51,435
Where do you have to go?
- Yes, give me a moment.

349
00:21:57,099 --> 00:21:58,934
God!
- What is it, Ma'am?

350
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:01,800
Nothing, really.

351
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:05,767
Do one thing, turn right here.
- Yes.

352
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,500
Wait, stop!

353
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:16,768
Four nine six zero.
Sir, please go further.

354
00:22:25,265 --> 00:22:27,600
There must be a phone booth here.
You can check. - Okay.

355
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:31,667
STD?

356
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:42,001
Hello? Yes, it's me, mom.

357
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:46,468
Yes, give me
the address again please.

358
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,933
l lost the address!

359
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,602
Don't give it, if you don't want to.
l don't want it either.

360
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:54,068
l am coming back home, okay?

361
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:06,368
Hey, excuse me!
Hey you!

362
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:10,569
Hey, excuse me, Mr. Goli!

363
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:15,169
Hey, you! Just you wait!

364
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,267
l was looking for you.

365
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:25,133
l was thinking about you, too.

366
00:23:25,232 --> 00:23:28,134
By the grace of the Divine Mother,
the boy is saved. Thank God!

367
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:30,467
Which boy?
- The one you came to mary.

368
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:32,634
l didn't come here to mary him.
l am here, just to meet him.

369
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:35,769
Yes, it's the same. - So, if l'm
here to meet him, l must mary him?

370
00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:38,267
That may be the case in Delhi.
We don't do that in Mumbai.

371
00:23:38,366 --> 00:23:40,167
l know what they do out there.

372
00:23:40,232 --> 00:23:42,100
Really?
What do they do out there?

373
00:23:42,165 --> 00:23:44,934
Just forget it. - No!
What do you mean by that? Tell me.

374
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,836
l am sory, Ma'am!
l am sory that l helped you!

375
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:50,468
l have lost seven hundred rupees.
The cop fined me. What did you gain?

376
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:53,301
You would get fined for not wearing
the helmet. Better follow the rules.

377
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:55,267
l don't follow the rules, okay?

378
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:58,001
My wish, whether l wear the helmet
or not. Why did you create a scene?

379
00:23:58,099 --> 00:24:00,100
Why did you tell him
l am your girlfriend?

380
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:03,402
l am not insane enough to say
you are my girlfriend.

381
00:24:03,466 --> 00:24:07,603
Really? Didn't you say it to the
officer? - It's the line, okay?

382
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:11,035
When you get caught,
and you have to make an excuse...

383
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:14,402
...it has to have a hint of emotion.
Get that, Ms. Selfish?

384
00:24:24,232 --> 00:24:25,833
l don't need a push,
l'll manage.

385
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:28,401
No, l need the message
which has the address. - What?

386
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:31,068
The message with the address in it.
- l deleted it.

387
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:33,033
What? How dare you?

388
00:24:33,933 --> 00:24:34,933
What?

389
00:24:37,332 --> 00:24:40,001
l paid Rs. 7690 cash
to buy the cell phone.

390
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:42,067
You don't have to dare me!
It's mine!

391
00:24:42,199 --> 00:24:44,234
Listen, l am really tense.

392
00:24:44,366 --> 00:24:47,168
lf l hadn't lost my cell phone,
l wouldn't even talk to you.

393
00:24:47,265 --> 00:24:49,233
Forget about talking!
Use your mind.

394
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:52,135
lt's rare for the inner human
to get aroused, in this day and age.

395
00:24:52,265 --> 00:24:57,069
lf people encounter someone
like you, no would care to help...

396
00:24:57,265 --> 00:24:59,834
...anybody, specially girls,
specially girls from Mumbai!

397
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:01,533
And they certainly
should not help!

398
00:25:06,165 --> 00:25:07,866
So, won't you give me
that message?

399
00:25:07,933 --> 00:25:09,334
l deleted it!

400
00:25:25,766 --> 00:25:28,768
D, 4069. Go ahead and turn left.
It's the last house.

401
00:25:28,933 --> 00:25:30,701
l'm not selfish like you.

402
00:25:30,766 --> 00:25:33,268
Thank you.
- Do you understand that?

403
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:34,767
l will manage.

404
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:37,034
Yes, as if she has managed
a lot, since morning!

405
00:25:39,165 --> 00:25:40,332
What is this?

406
00:25:44,165 --> 00:25:46,433
Ball!
- Give it here...

407
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,036
Uncle, you can't park
the scooter here.

408
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:53,701
Why?
- Because, it is a no parking zone.

409
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:55,667
Be quiet! No parking, it seems.

410
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:02,101
Grandpa!
Grandpa!

411
00:26:02,566 --> 00:26:04,301
Grandpa, come out, quickly!

412
00:26:04,466 --> 00:26:07,168
Grandpa! Grandpa!

413
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:08,900
What is it?

414
00:26:09,232 --> 00:26:10,866
Grandpa!
- Grandpa!

415
00:26:11,032 --> 00:26:12,433
Whose scooter is this?

416
00:26:12,499 --> 00:26:14,000
He went there.

417
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:17,435
Pull the wire out.
- Yay!

418
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,733
Excuse me!
- Yes, please?

419
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:27,067
Uncle.
- Is this your scooter?

420
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:29,600
ls this my house,
or a parking lot?

421
00:26:29,699 --> 00:26:31,367
Yes. Right.

422
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:35,436
Uncle, l need to ask about
an address. - Yes, go ahead.

423
00:26:35,566 --> 00:26:37,067
Where can l find 4069?

424
00:26:37,132 --> 00:26:39,834
Go to the building on the corner,
ring the bell on the second floor.

425
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,000
Oh, okay.
Thanks, Uncle.

426
00:26:42,132 --> 00:26:43,299
Good day to you.

427
00:26:45,866 --> 00:26:47,300
Pull out the wires at
the back, too.

428
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:49,734
Hey, we have already done that.

429
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:59,135
Yes? - Where are the people
from the second floor?

430
00:27:59,265 --> 00:28:01,867
l don't know. We are not
on talking terms with them.

431
00:28:02,165 --> 00:28:03,165
But...

432
00:28:08,265 --> 00:28:09,566
Sister!

433
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:13,802
Are you from Mumbai?
- Yes

434
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:20,801
Hello, Sister.
- Hi!

435
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:25,336
Actually, Aunt told me
you were going to come over.

436
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:29,035
Aunt?
- Yes, Siddharth's mom.

437
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:33,369
She had to go out somewhere.
So, she told me...

438
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:38,571
...if you come over, l should
give you Siddharth's phone number.

439
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,367
Oh, how sweet!

440
00:28:40,432 --> 00:28:43,268
Write it down quickly
or mom will scold me.

441
00:28:43,566 --> 00:28:44,900
Oh, yes, right.
Just a moment.

442
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:47,000
9015...

443
00:28:47,132 --> 00:28:49,234
...95$99.

444
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:53,969
Actually, Siddharth is my cousin.
- Oh!

445
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:58,102
Dad and Uncle are fighting,
these days. - Oh.

446
00:28:58,332 --> 00:29:02,636
But, don't wory. Evemhing
will be fine by the wedding.

447
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,868
Yes, what's the number, dear?

448
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:07,934
90...
- Ayesha!

449
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:11,768
Oh, God! Okay, bye.
- Just give me the number...

450
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:16,800
What was that number again?

451
00:29:17,499 --> 00:29:19,133
90155...

452
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,900
...95$$9.

453
00:29:21,032 --> 00:29:23,667
Yes. 90155...

454
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:25,601
...95$99.

455
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:29,202
5595$99.

456
00:29:29,265 --> 00:29:31,600
90155...

457
00:29:31,699 --> 00:29:35,102
90155...

458
00:29:35,165 --> 00:29:39,035
90155...90155...

459
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:41,000
90155...

460
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:45,467
90155...

461
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:47,034
90155...

462
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,101
90155...

463
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,933
Have you lost your mind?
- Keep quiet!

464
00:29:54,065 --> 00:29:56,434
Why are you talking to yourself
like a lunatic? - Be quiet!

465
00:29:56,532 --> 00:29:58,500
What? What did you say?
What?

466
00:29:58,566 --> 00:30:00,200
95... - l heard you speak.
Did you say be quiet?

467
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,200
Hey, excuse me! l could say
a lot, too!

468
00:30:02,265 --> 00:30:04,567
Listen, l am talking to you!
Yes, you! - Oh, no!

469
00:30:04,666 --> 00:30:06,768
Oh, no! What a fool! - You can't say
anything just because you are a girl.

470
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:08,734
What? What does this mean?
- Oh, God! Fool!

471
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,400
That's no way to talk!

472
00:30:10,532 --> 00:30:11,833
Oh, yes! Right.

473
00:30:11,966 --> 00:30:13,934
What's your problem?
l forgot the number!

474
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,901
Oh, no! Were you memorizing
the number?

475
00:30:16,632 --> 00:30:17,933
You don't memorize numbers like that.

476
00:30:18,032 --> 00:30:21,268
l can memorize a number
the instant someone tells it to me.

477
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:26,971
Oh God! Give these Mumbai girls
some nutritious supplements.

478
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:29,634
So that they can start thinking
a little faster.

479
00:30:29,699 --> 00:30:33,202
They mess things up, since
they ty to wrap them up in a hury.

480
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,268
Yes? Yes?
What are you thinking about?

481
00:30:49,532 --> 00:30:51,233
Are you daydreaming, now?

482
00:30:51,332 --> 00:30:53,701
l wish, some dreams would
come true. - What?

483
00:30:54,866 --> 00:30:57,368
Alright, an_ay.
You want the number, right?

484
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:00,535
9015595$$9.

485
00:31:01,232 --> 00:31:03,601
How do you know?
- Oh, now, this is just too much!

486
00:31:05,165 --> 00:31:07,000
Here, take this!
You can check.

487
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,567
lt's your message, that
came today morning.

488
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:11,201
l didn't delete it.

489
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:16,368
Folks from Delhi are
really generous.

490
00:31:19,566 --> 00:31:22,735
...95$$9.. 90..

491
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:25,835
9015595$$9.

492
00:31:25,899 --> 00:31:29,369
9015595$$9.

493
00:31:29,933 --> 00:31:32,869
9015595$$9.

494
00:31:33,065 --> 00:31:34,399
9015595$$9.

495
00:31:34,466 --> 00:31:37,769
Listen to me. Make the call
from my cell phone.

496
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:40,000
You did that before, right?

497
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:42,167
Or you will forget the number,
again.

498
00:31:43,265 --> 00:31:45,233
9015595$$9.

499
00:31:45,733 --> 00:31:47,301
l got it recharged.

500
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:51,768
Oh, God!

501
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,067
Here you are.

502
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:02,567
Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

503
00:32:02,632 --> 00:32:05,134
You will always remember
what a fine guy you met.

504
00:32:15,432 --> 00:32:16,666
Oh, no!

505
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:18,734
lt's okay.
Ty once more.

506
00:32:24,265 --> 00:32:26,300
Take the call, you fool!

507
00:32:26,699 --> 00:32:29,902
Forget about it! Ditch the loser!
You are going to say no, anyway.

508
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:37,767
How do you know,
l am going to say no?

509
00:32:37,866 --> 00:32:42,203
Come on! The entire city heard it
when you shouted it out to your mom.

510
00:32:42,532 --> 00:32:44,667
You eavesdrop on others'
conversations!

511
00:32:46,032 --> 00:32:48,234
How disgusting you are!
- Excuse me!

512
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,768
l won't improve my general
knowledge, by listening to you.

513
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:52,401
My ears are fully functional,
right?

514
00:32:52,499 --> 00:32:55,869
Your powers of speech are good,
and so are my powers of hearing!

515
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:57,734
Oh, gosh!
Why don't you just pipe down?

516
00:32:58,065 --> 00:32:59,266
Don't you get tired?

517
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:02,034
Made in Delhi!
- Listen...

518
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,801
...l left the house this morning.
l haven't eaten a bite.

519
00:33:05,966 --> 00:33:09,102
Oh no! l haven't eaten anything
either, thanks to you! Let's go.

520
00:33:11,432 --> 00:33:13,667
Come on, let's go!
Let's go.

521
00:33:14,933 --> 00:33:19,404
What is it? - Listen, l am not
some girl you can take for granted.

522
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:22,168
What is it, now?
- Why should l come with you?

523
00:33:22,232 --> 00:33:24,367
Alright, don't come
with me. Go straight ahead.

524
00:33:24,432 --> 00:33:26,066
Take the last left turn, and
take the second right turn.

525
00:33:26,132 --> 00:33:28,667
Then, cross the T-junction that
comes up. Once you do that...

526
00:33:28,733 --> 00:33:32,403
...there is a yellow building next to
a green one, with a coffee shop.

527
00:33:32,632 --> 00:33:33,866
Go ahead.

528
00:33:35,032 --> 00:33:36,500
By the way, you know something?

529
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:39,068
lt's not as if, girls are in
short supply in Delhi.

530
00:33:39,165 --> 00:33:40,766
l won't chase after you.

531
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:42,234
l swear by the Divine Mother.

532
00:33:42,332 --> 00:33:45,601
ln this day and age, the inner human
is aroused with great difficulty.

533
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:47,868
That's enough!
Stop it. Let's go.

534
00:33:58,065 --> 00:33:59,433
What is it?

535
00:34:02,366 --> 00:34:05,001
Get off the bike.
- What is it, now?

536
00:34:06,032 --> 00:34:07,400
You'll have to push the bike.

537
00:34:08,165 --> 00:34:09,799
Oh, God!

538
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:18,335
Yes, let's go.
Put some elbow into it! Speed! Yes!

539
00:34:40,299 --> 00:34:41,900
Yes.

540
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:50,366
Here you are.

541
00:34:51,065 --> 00:34:52,166
Thank you.

542
00:34:58,799 --> 00:35:02,736
lf you're hungy in Delhi, eating at
a coffee shop is a cardinal sin.

543
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,404
When you have piping hot
Bhatura (fried flatbreads)...

544
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:11,069
...coupled with the Pindi Chole
(white chickpeas).

545
00:35:11,866 --> 00:35:15,936
A chutney with julienned ginger,
coriander and pomegranate seeds.

546
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:18,467
And a single dy green chili.

547
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:21,869
When that combination
makes its way to your stomach...

548
00:35:29,299 --> 00:35:30,299
Wow!

549
00:35:30,499 --> 00:35:32,467
...yes, it is wow!
Come on, eat up!

550
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:42,268
Not like that! There is a way
to eat evey single thing.

551
00:35:42,399 --> 00:35:45,001
From the heart to the stomach.
That's when you are truly content.

552
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:47,768
Sometimes,
the bliss is confined to the heart.

553
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,202
The cholesterol levels get higher,
the arteries get blocked.

554
00:35:50,265 --> 00:35:52,700
And then, you have a
heart attack.

555
00:35:52,799 --> 00:35:54,901
Please don't say that!
l am my mom's only son!

556
00:35:55,065 --> 00:35:57,434
God made you so pretty!
Why can't you be nice, too?

557
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,068
ln a few days, both of you
will look the same.

558
00:36:00,265 --> 00:36:02,400
Both of you, as in?
- As in, you and the Bhatura.

559
00:36:02,532 --> 00:36:04,834
Hey, concentrate and eat!

560
00:36:04,933 --> 00:36:06,968
This taste is going
to change your point of view.

561
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:09,000
Really? How is that going to happen?

562
00:36:09,299 --> 00:36:11,434
You will fall in love.
- What?

563
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,502
Not with me!
You'll fall in love with Delhi.

564
00:36:17,766 --> 00:36:20,702
So? Are you here, alone
to meet the boy?

565
00:36:21,032 --> 00:36:23,033
Why?
Can't l come to meet him, alone?

566
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:24,733
Oh no! You've drawn
your sword out, again!

567
00:36:24,799 --> 00:36:28,002
Why don't you just relax, my
Rani of Jhansi (militant queen)?

568
00:36:29,065 --> 00:36:30,466
So, did you like the boy?

569
00:36:30,866 --> 00:36:33,401
l didn't meet him.
He wasn't at home. Anything else?

570
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,900
l wonder how long l will have
to wait.

571
00:36:35,065 --> 00:36:37,534
Just forget about it! An_ays,
you are going to say no.

572
00:36:37,632 --> 00:36:39,333
You can always send a message,
or something, later.

573
00:36:39,466 --> 00:36:41,167
Besides,
you are a girl from Mumbai.

574
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:44,201
Listen, you are in a city
like Delhi...

575
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:46,334
...with a boy whom you don't know
and you're roaming around on my bike.

576
00:36:46,499 --> 00:36:49,068
You can sit here and shovel
Bhaturas... - Hold it right there!

577
00:36:49,566 --> 00:36:51,868
Please, keep your ideas to yourself.

578
00:36:52,065 --> 00:36:55,835
l mean, it is true,
that l sat with you, on your bike.

579
00:36:56,099 --> 00:37:01,804
And it is also true, l am here
at this Chole Bhature joint with you.

580
00:37:02,432 --> 00:37:05,067
But, that doesn't make me easy,
okay?

581
00:37:05,466 --> 00:37:07,968
You helped me.
l thought, you were alright.

582
00:37:08,399 --> 00:37:11,902
So, l thought, instead of trusting
a stranger, it would be better...

583
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,502
...to trust a stranger
l have met a couple of times.

584
00:37:15,265 --> 00:37:16,499
That's what l am saying!

585
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:21,169
By the way, what does the boy do?
- l don't know.

586
00:37:22,065 --> 00:37:24,367
Then, he'll get married
and run his dad's shop.

587
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,900
An_ay, boys in Delhi have
it pretty set it terms of a career.

588
00:37:27,966 --> 00:37:30,368
Their Dad's shop!
- So, what's wrong with that?

589
00:37:31,899 --> 00:37:35,202
Taking care of it, and taking it
to the top is an art.

590
00:37:35,632 --> 00:37:40,436
lt's not a small thing to make sure
your shop is a cut above the rest.

591
00:37:40,933 --> 00:37:42,434
That's what marketing is all about.

592
00:37:44,332 --> 00:37:48,035
Yes, you do have a point.
l agree.

593
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:51,435
Agreed? Then, that's taken care of.
You can have a happy married life!

594
00:37:51,532 --> 00:37:54,201
Come on!
God save me from that fool!

595
00:37:54,366 --> 00:37:56,101
l don't even want to get married.

596
00:37:56,265 --> 00:37:58,600
ls he a fool, too?
That's amazing.

597
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:01,135
lf a boy likes me after
seeing a photo of me...

598
00:38:01,232 --> 00:38:02,933
...isn't he the biggest fool of all?

599
00:38:03,065 --> 00:38:05,700
l mean, which world do you live in?
Let's meet and talk.

600
00:38:05,799 --> 00:38:08,334
Ty to understand the other
person and then say yes or no.

601
00:38:08,532 --> 00:38:11,434
Oh, this is way too much!
l mean, you haven't even met him.

602
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:15,068
Come on! How can he like
you just be seeing a photo?

603
00:38:15,332 --> 00:38:18,101
Where did you meet this fool?
- He's my mom's best friend's son.

604
00:38:19,933 --> 00:38:22,969
The loser will regret it.
He said yes, after seeing your photo!

605
00:38:23,065 --> 00:38:24,099
He's taking a maior risk!

606
00:38:24,432 --> 00:38:27,201
Later, he is going to moan
about being deceived.

607
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,334
lt won't come to that.

608
00:38:30,566 --> 00:38:33,335
l don't want to mary him,
since l know he is from Delhi.

609
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:36,268
What do you mean?
- l mean, he's from Delhi! Delhi?

610
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:39,434
Delhi? - What are you harping
about Delhi for?

611
00:38:39,632 --> 00:38:43,302
The boys in Delhi are way smarter
than the boys from Mumbai.

612
00:38:43,366 --> 00:38:44,834
lt's just the boys from Delhi
who think so.

613
00:38:44,899 --> 00:38:46,934
What do you have to think about?
It's a fact!

614
00:38:47,032 --> 00:38:50,034
The boys from Delhi go to Mumbai
and become vey important people.

615
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:51,400
They rule the world!

616
00:38:51,499 --> 00:38:53,000
Shahrukh Khan?
Delhi boy.

617
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:54,767
Akshay Kumar, Delhi boy!

618
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,335
Really? So, why don't they
make it big, in Delhi itself?

619
00:38:57,399 --> 00:38:58,933
They have to come to Mumbai,
right?

620
00:38:59,065 --> 00:39:00,332
That's right!

621
00:39:00,399 --> 00:39:02,901
Because, it's not just Mumbai,
the entire county... no, no...

622
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,403
...the entire world needs to have
boys from Delhi.

623
00:39:06,466 --> 00:39:09,101
And that is advantage Delhi!

624
00:39:09,499 --> 00:39:10,566
God!

625
00:39:10,699 --> 00:39:12,300
What is this?

626
00:39:12,499 --> 00:39:15,835
That's why your mom chose
a Delhi boy, for you.

627
00:39:15,899 --> 00:39:18,134
Are you done?
Or is there anything else?

628
00:39:18,332 --> 00:39:20,300
Can we leave, now?
- Yes!

629
00:39:20,632 --> 00:39:22,000
Sir, the bill!

630
00:39:22,299 --> 00:39:25,869
Hey, stop it! That's not done!
What am l here for?

631
00:39:25,933 --> 00:39:28,969
Excuse me, are we on a date?
We'll go Dutch.

632
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:30,500
You pay for your share,
l will pay mine.

633
00:39:30,699 --> 00:39:32,867
You have a lot of rules.
- You should have them.

634
00:39:32,966 --> 00:39:34,500
Sir, your bill.
- l don't have any.

635
00:39:34,566 --> 00:39:36,100
Then, you should have them!

636
00:39:39,399 --> 00:39:41,501
Here is my share.
l will be back.

637
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:56,834
Oh, no! The cop took all
the money!

638
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:00,633
One hundred and twenty?

639
00:40:06,132 --> 00:40:08,400
Goli, you're in trouble, now.
- Shall we go?

640
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:13,236
Yes! Listen to me.
- What?

641
00:40:13,532 --> 00:40:15,000
Can you pay for me, too?

642
00:40:16,532 --> 00:40:18,700
What?
- Pay for me, too.

643
00:40:18,966 --> 00:40:20,167
Why?

644
00:40:20,332 --> 00:40:22,834
My money is over.
- What?

645
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:26,435
What do you mean?
The cop fined me, this morning!

646
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,300
Did you forget that?
Seven hundred rupees!

647
00:40:28,499 --> 00:40:30,334
l had no idea all this would
happen.

648
00:40:30,399 --> 00:40:31,867
Go on, pay it.
It's only sixty rupees.

649
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,434
Buddy, pay your own bill, okay?

650
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:38,636
What are you doing?
- l know boys like you, really well.

651
00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:40,433
You want a free treat, right?

652
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:45,269
Hey, why are you ruining
my reputation?

653
00:40:45,366 --> 00:40:46,967
Go on, pay it. It's just sixty rupees.
l'll repay you later.

654
00:40:47,065 --> 00:40:48,966
Really? How?
- What do you mean, how?

655
00:40:49,165 --> 00:40:52,234
l'll withdraw it from the ATM.
- Do you have money in the ATM?

656
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:55,335
l am not crazy?
- Who knows? You may run away.

657
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:57,034
Run... run...

658
00:40:57,366 --> 00:40:59,601
Oh God! Here, keep my bike.

659
00:40:59,733 --> 00:41:01,634
What am l going to do
with your broken down bike?

660
00:41:01,733 --> 00:41:03,501
Oh, no!

661
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:06,034
Here, you are.
Keep my watch.

662
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:08,734
Take it! Go on!
Take it.

663
00:41:10,466 --> 00:41:11,600
This is too much!

664
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:13,968
Why are you making such
a scene about sixty rupees?

665
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:17,267
l mean, girls from Mumbai
just don't trust anyone, do they?

666
00:41:18,065 --> 00:41:20,500
What?
- You're giving me the watch, right?

667
00:41:21,733 --> 00:41:22,800
What?
- Yes.

668
00:41:30,065 --> 00:41:31,199
The watch?

669
00:41:33,299 --> 00:41:35,200
Now, you have to pay me
forty rupees.

670
00:41:36,632 --> 00:41:39,034
l've seen so much drama for
Rs. 60 for the first time in my life.

671
00:41:39,165 --> 00:41:40,933
Money is money, buddy.

672
00:41:42,065 --> 00:41:43,399
You are pretty rigid when
it comes to accounts.

673
00:41:43,466 --> 00:41:44,867
Okay, where is Delhi
Haat (Delhi Market)?

674
00:41:45,065 --> 00:41:46,766
What?
- Where is Delhi Haat?

675
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:50,134
lt's near the AlIMS campus.

676
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,267
There is a ring road, out here.
Get onto that.

677
00:41:52,366 --> 00:41:54,101
lt's right opposite
the INA market.

678
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:56,467
lf you can't figure it out,
ask someone.

679
00:41:56,733 --> 00:41:58,601
There will be a lot of traffic,
right now.

680
00:41:58,866 --> 00:42:00,767
l will manage. Thanks.

681
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:41,201
How dare you?
- Are you crazy?

682
00:42:41,265 --> 00:42:42,633
Just watch your hands, okay?

683
00:42:42,733 --> 00:42:45,001
l didn't touch you on purpose.
You didn't watch where you're going.

684
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:47,233
Do you want another slap?
- Hey you... - Oh, no!

685
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:49,034
Control yourself!
- Just ty and touch me. - Hush!

686
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,700
What are you doing?
- Be quiet! - Control her. - Yes.

687
00:42:50,766 --> 00:42:53,168
l will not consider that she is
a girl. You know me. - Yes!

688
00:42:53,232 --> 00:42:55,534
Go and tease your mom!
- Be quiet.

689
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,300
Hey!
- What? - Forget it, just leave.

690
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,101
l am sory. l...
- Just ty and touch... - Hey!

691
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,868
l am saying sory.
l am sory. - Let's see you do it.

692
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:04,667
Get going, all of you!
There's nothing to see, here.

693
00:43:04,733 --> 00:43:07,368
The drama is over.
Okay, bye. - Go on, get lost you...

694
00:43:07,432 --> 00:43:09,300
Are you crazy?
This is Delhi, okay?

695
00:43:09,366 --> 00:43:11,501
So what? Do the girls
become public property?

696
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,434
Just control yourself,
this is not done in Delhi.

697
00:43:13,532 --> 00:43:16,167
Then, it should be done!
It should be done, now. Get it?

698
00:43:16,232 --> 00:43:19,935
Behave yourself, okay? - Women
from your families are molested...

699
00:43:20,032 --> 00:43:22,567
...and you become infamous
for that, in the entire county.

700
00:43:22,632 --> 00:43:23,899
lt's out in all the newspapers,
evey day.

701
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,235
You molest girls and you don't
even say anything to the molester!

702
00:43:26,299 --> 00:43:28,100
lf you want to stop anyone,
stop people like him.

703
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:30,834
Then, you will be a hero in your
view and in ours.

704
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,634
And now, get lost!

705
00:43:33,065 --> 00:43:35,167
Just relax.
- Get lost!

706
00:44:20,132 --> 00:44:24,636
''My misguided steps,
wander day and night.''

707
00:44:25,032 --> 00:44:29,169
''lt looks for unknown
alleys and streets.''

708
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:34,204
''Evey new ambience is
settled in my eyes.''

709
00:44:34,499 --> 00:44:38,703
''Small desires of small heart.''

710
00:44:38,933 --> 00:44:43,103
''This world is a stranger.''

711
00:44:43,532 --> 00:44:48,570
''l will know that
little by little evey day.''

712
00:44:48,933 --> 00:44:53,704
''O traveler, listen to my stoy.''

713
00:44:53,766 --> 00:44:58,470
''l'm reaching the destination
that is in the sky.''

714
00:44:58,566 --> 00:45:02,970
''O traveler, listen to my stoy.''

715
00:45:03,332 --> 00:45:08,637
''A little confused and little crazy.''

716
00:45:26,632 --> 00:45:31,403
''Evey turn is different.
There's secret behind evey move.''

717
00:45:31,532 --> 00:45:36,103
''Sunshine is different, shade is
different, a different ambience.''

718
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:41,037
''Evey tune is different,
evey color has a new song.''

719
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:46,070
''The land is different,
sky is different.''

720
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:50,536
''This world is a puzzle.''

721
00:45:50,632 --> 00:45:56,004
''Let me solve it a little evey day.''

722
00:45:58,432 --> 00:46:03,236
''O traveler, listen to my stoy.''

723
00:46:03,299 --> 00:46:08,003
''l'm reaching the destination
that is in the sky.''

724
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:12,769
''O traveler, listen to my stoy.''

725
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:18,605
''A little confused and little crazy.''

726
00:46:22,299 --> 00:46:25,235
Hey!

727
00:46:29,532 --> 00:46:30,699
Hey!

728
00:46:31,165 --> 00:46:32,833
You? What are you doing here?

729
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:36,001
l was looking for you?
- Really? What is this?

730
00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:37,667
This? Nothing much.

731
00:46:37,866 --> 00:46:40,468
What are you going to do with this?
- Beat someone up.

732
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:43,702
Whom will you beat up?
- All those who molest girls.

733
00:46:44,532 --> 00:46:47,067
How come, all of a sudden?
- Because of you.

734
00:46:47,733 --> 00:46:48,567
Really?

735
00:46:48,632 --> 00:46:51,368
We should not ignore all these
things, the way we have been.

736
00:46:51,432 --> 00:46:53,033
They grow bolder.

737
00:46:54,466 --> 00:46:57,202
lt doesn't call for courage,
it's misbehavior. - Whatever!

738
00:46:57,366 --> 00:47:00,602
Today, l realize!
One slap would just set them right.

739
00:47:00,866 --> 00:47:03,668
l swear by the Divine Mother,
if someone teases you...

740
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:06,268
...l will thrash the life out of him.
- Why?

741
00:47:07,432 --> 00:47:08,966
l mean, if anybody is teased!

742
00:47:09,466 --> 00:47:11,067
lt's okay.
Eveyone is not the same.

743
00:47:11,165 --> 00:47:13,300
But, still! l am sory.

744
00:47:13,532 --> 00:47:17,168
Why are you sory? You're alright.
- l'm sory on behalf of Delhi.

745
00:47:18,566 --> 00:47:22,036
Emotional son of Delhi, are you
going to set the city right in a day?

746
00:47:28,566 --> 00:47:30,267
Buddy, you're a firecracker.

747
00:47:30,399 --> 00:47:31,199
What is that?

748
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:34,935
The way you slapped him!
l'm sure, he'll never forget it.

749
00:47:35,232 --> 00:47:38,368
l am sure, your bo_riend gets
slapped around a bit, too.

750
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:40,567
How do you know,
that l have a bo_riend?

751
00:47:40,766 --> 00:47:42,400
l can figure it out.

752
00:47:42,466 --> 00:47:45,468
You're a girl from Mumbai.
People hook up easily, there.

753
00:47:45,766 --> 00:47:47,434
How come?
- There's more freedom.

754
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:48,433
What?

755
00:47:48,499 --> 00:47:51,435
l mean, go to college after
school, go to discotheques...

756
00:47:51,532 --> 00:47:54,434
...with boys, and dress up
without any taboos. - Really?

757
00:47:54,499 --> 00:47:57,001
Yes! It's pretty
modern out there, right?

758
00:47:57,065 --> 00:47:58,666
Evemhing is done
way before time.

759
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:01,001
There's lots of freedom.
Anything goes.

760
00:48:01,265 --> 00:48:03,500
Lots of freedom.
- Yes.

761
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,435
Your research is pretty detailed.
- Thank you!

762
00:48:06,499 --> 00:48:09,101
l don't think you have a girlfriend.
- Why?

763
00:48:09,532 --> 00:48:11,300
lt's evident from your face.

764
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,336
What?
Sir, stop right here.

765
00:48:16,265 --> 00:48:18,100
What is evident?
Hey!

766
00:48:18,332 --> 00:48:20,000
How much is it?
- Ten rupees.

767
00:48:20,332 --> 00:48:21,966
What is evident?

768
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:24,867
What is evident?

769
00:48:25,332 --> 00:48:27,300
Come on! Tell me!
What's evident?

770
00:48:27,366 --> 00:48:29,601
Hello, l am talking to you...
Hey!

771
00:48:30,632 --> 00:48:33,968
lt's evident, you didn't get
any freedom in the college.

772
00:48:34,065 --> 00:48:37,601
You didn't go to discos with girls.
You can't wear what you want.

773
00:48:37,766 --> 00:48:40,468
lt's not as if you are at liberty
like we are in Mumbai.

774
00:48:40,532 --> 00:48:42,767
lt's clearly evident that...

775
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:45,035
...Delhi folks get frustrated.

776
00:48:45,099 --> 00:48:48,268
And frustrated people,
don't get hooked up. Right?

777
00:48:50,432 --> 00:48:54,002
l have an innumerable
amount of settings. Get it?

778
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:57,034
Goli is the king of hook ups!

779
00:49:01,232 --> 00:49:04,435
l can't even tell you myself,
how many girlfriends l have!

780
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:07,668
Really?
Have you taken a look in the mirror?

781
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:11,333
Do you think, l am lying?

782
00:49:12,432 --> 00:49:14,100
No. Not at all!

783
00:49:14,566 --> 00:49:15,566
What did you say?

784
00:49:15,632 --> 00:49:18,034
You have innumerable hook ups?
- You bet.

785
00:49:18,432 --> 00:49:20,634
You don't even know how many
girlfriends you have.

786
00:49:20,733 --> 00:49:21,934
That's right.

787
00:49:25,032 --> 00:49:26,166
Have you had any experience?

788
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:31,701
Are you crazy?

789
00:49:31,766 --> 00:49:33,200
Why? What is it, now?

790
00:49:33,432 --> 00:49:36,234
You can ask iust about anything!

791
00:49:36,966 --> 00:49:39,902
What is it, now?
You're acting all coy, now.

792
00:49:40,766 --> 00:49:42,901
You aren't even blushing!
- Why should l?

793
00:49:43,366 --> 00:49:44,834
l'm a Mumbai girl, right?

794
00:49:45,099 --> 00:49:48,669
You said, we are a bit
ultra modern, right?

795
00:49:49,099 --> 00:49:51,668
Evemhing happens before time.
Full freedom.

796
00:49:52,632 --> 00:49:54,834
You tell me,
have you been with a girl?

797
00:49:55,032 --> 00:49:57,801
What if l ask you the
same question?

798
00:49:58,265 --> 00:49:59,633
l asked you, first.

799
00:50:07,332 --> 00:50:08,332
Yes.

800
00:50:09,232 --> 00:50:10,633
There was one encounter.

801
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,768
l...l tried.

802
00:50:16,032 --> 00:50:18,033
Then, what?
- What then?

803
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,234
Then what?

804
00:50:20,699 --> 00:50:22,300
What then?

805
00:50:24,899 --> 00:50:26,767
She got scared and...

806
00:50:28,933 --> 00:50:30,000
...she ran away.

807
00:50:30,099 --> 00:50:32,734
What?
She got scared and ran away?

808
00:50:34,399 --> 00:50:36,100
She didn't get scared of me
and run away.

809
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,134
She got scared, that she might...

810
00:50:39,766 --> 00:50:40,967
She might...

811
00:50:41,432 --> 00:50:43,000
...get pregnant.

812
00:50:43,632 --> 00:50:45,133
Then what?
- What then?

813
00:50:45,699 --> 00:50:48,435
lf she didn't agree,
l wasn't going to force myself on her!

814
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:50,066
We are decent.

815
00:50:50,165 --> 00:50:53,568
Yes, right. You are really decent.

816
00:50:54,332 --> 00:50:57,234
Really? You are laughing as if...

817
00:50:57,366 --> 00:51:00,035
...you've earned a diploma
in these matters.

818
00:51:00,466 --> 00:51:01,934
Okay, tell me something.

819
00:51:02,632 --> 00:51:05,301
What if the girl hadn't gotten
scared about getting pregnant?

820
00:51:07,566 --> 00:51:09,868
Be honest, now.
- Then?

821
00:51:13,332 --> 00:51:16,435
Then, then...
- Really?

822
00:51:17,432 --> 00:51:20,234
What about your
homegrown values in that case?

823
00:51:20,299 --> 00:51:24,102
What do you mean?
- Consider, how to reach the point.

824
00:51:24,432 --> 00:51:27,668
Don't label your lack of confidence
as your values!

825
00:51:27,899 --> 00:51:31,002
lt doesn't mean you have values,
it means you are a hypocrite. Get it?

826
00:51:31,332 --> 00:51:34,334
You seem to be an old hand
at all this.

827
00:51:37,099 --> 00:51:38,300
Have you kissed a girl?

828
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:40,567
Have l kissed a girl?

829
00:51:40,899 --> 00:51:43,167
Yes, sure!
Let's just forget about it.

830
00:51:43,332 --> 00:51:47,369
l'm not being a hypocrite.
l really am held back by my values.

831
00:51:48,899 --> 00:51:52,502
By the way, they are towing
away that bike. Isn't it yours?

832
00:51:53,799 --> 00:51:56,368
No, it's not.
Hey, you! No!

833
00:51:56,432 --> 00:51:58,267
Hey, excuse me, Sir!
Hello!

834
00:51:58,332 --> 00:52:02,402
What are you doing? What...
- Talk to sir.

835
00:52:02,532 --> 00:52:05,401
Sir! Officer, what are you
doing, Sir?

836
00:52:05,466 --> 00:52:06,633
Sir, l went there, foriust a moment.

837
00:52:06,733 --> 00:52:08,367
You parked inanoparking
lOne.

838
00:52:08,432 --> 00:52:10,767
Come to the police station.
- Sir, please listen to me. - Hey.

839
00:52:10,833 --> 00:52:12,901
Sir, you listen to me.

840
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,369
Sir, a child was lost, and he
was cying in the street.

841
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:17,467
We went to the police station
to drop him.

842
00:52:17,532 --> 00:52:19,867
Yes. - Who knows?
He may find his parents. - Yes!

843
00:52:19,966 --> 00:52:22,068
But, when we went ahead a bit,
we did find his parents.

844
00:52:22,132 --> 00:52:24,701
So, we had to park the bike
anywhere, since we were in a hury.

845
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:28,402
Sir, it's so rare for the inner human
to get aroused in this day and age.

846
00:52:28,499 --> 00:52:31,902
Yes! - Sir, if you fine us for this,
no one will help anybody!

847
00:52:31,966 --> 00:52:35,235
He is not at fault.

848
00:52:35,299 --> 00:52:37,367
Please sir, please.

849
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:38,866
Please!

850
00:52:39,265 --> 00:52:40,733
Get their bike off the van!

851
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:43,035
Thank you, Sir.
- Thank you, Sir.

852
00:52:45,532 --> 00:52:47,767
Slowly, careful!

853
00:52:50,265 --> 00:52:51,265
Thank you.

854
00:52:54,566 --> 00:52:57,368
Thank you. Thank you.

855
00:53:19,866 --> 00:53:22,602
So, how much do they fine
you for that?

856
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:27,500
lt would be
a thousand rupees at least.

857
00:53:28,866 --> 00:53:30,667
So, give me three hundred rupees.
- Three...

858
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:32,500
Three... what for?

859
00:53:32,699 --> 00:53:34,734
1000 minus 700 you paid
in the morning is 300.

860
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:41,935
Okay, fine. l will spare you.
At least say thank you.

861
00:53:42,232 --> 00:53:43,399
Thank you.

862
00:53:45,399 --> 00:53:47,300
Why do you keep taking pictures?

863
00:53:47,666 --> 00:53:50,301
Heritage and historically
important stuff. - Oh.

864
00:53:50,799 --> 00:53:53,601
Which people seem to have
forgotten about. It's just a hobby.

865
00:53:53,766 --> 00:53:55,634
That's why l have come to Delhi.

866
00:53:55,766 --> 00:53:58,502
Mom tagged on the
'meet the boy' thing, later.

867
00:53:58,566 --> 00:53:59,767
Okay.

868
00:54:02,532 --> 00:54:04,700
Would you like to see a place?

869
00:54:05,432 --> 00:54:07,700
Please don't think l am
flirting with you.

870
00:54:35,666 --> 00:54:36,833
Wow!

871
00:54:37,366 --> 00:54:41,803
This is so beautiful!
Thanks.

872
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:45,535
lf you hadn't brought me here,
l may have never seen this place.

873
00:54:45,632 --> 00:54:48,434
lt's okay! Come on,
l should thank you.

874
00:54:48,699 --> 00:54:50,801
You acted so well
when the cop was around!

875
00:54:51,399 --> 00:54:52,733
That was awesome!

876
00:54:53,232 --> 00:54:54,800
lt's so peaceful, here!

877
00:54:55,532 --> 00:54:57,300
lt doesn't feel like that...

878
00:54:57,399 --> 00:55:00,435
...it's so crowded and noisy
outside there.

879
00:55:00,866 --> 00:55:02,734
There will be people,
who keep honking their horns!

880
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:05,168
But, you used all my dialogues,
right?

881
00:55:05,265 --> 00:55:07,100
That one about the inner human!

882
00:55:07,733 --> 00:55:09,234
lt's my copyright.
Remember that!

883
00:55:09,332 --> 00:55:12,034
One could forget about all
of one's worries, out here.

884
00:55:12,299 --> 00:55:14,801
Just settle down.

885
00:55:15,799 --> 00:55:18,801
Take a deep breath and all
the tension just flows out of you.

886
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,736
You know, you do cary off that
hint of emotion, nicely.

887
00:55:22,766 --> 00:55:24,601
Why don't you zip it,
Mr. Motor mouth?

888
00:55:25,299 --> 00:55:26,700
Don't you get tired of talking?

889
00:55:29,332 --> 00:55:30,900
Give me your cell phone.
- What?

890
00:55:31,299 --> 00:55:32,733
Come on!

891
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:37,533
Your cell phone.

892
00:55:41,566 --> 00:55:43,968
Thanks.
- It's okay. You can pay me later.

893
00:55:45,766 --> 00:55:46,933
God!

894
00:55:58,332 --> 00:56:00,400
Hello! Mom, it's me.

895
00:56:01,065 --> 00:56:03,133
Nothing much.
l am spending some time.

896
00:56:03,232 --> 00:56:04,900
l am taking some pictures.

897
00:56:05,265 --> 00:56:07,467
l didn't get through.
His phone is busy.

898
00:56:08,165 --> 00:56:11,434
Mom, l am really tying!
He's the one l am waiting for.

899
00:56:11,966 --> 00:56:16,036
Okay, listen to me.
l am sory for this morning.

900
00:56:17,065 --> 00:56:19,100
Mom, it's not what you think...

901
00:56:20,499 --> 00:56:22,868
Mom, why are you dragging Arnav
into this?

902
00:56:23,466 --> 00:56:25,768
Mom, what do you mean
by do what you want? Listen to me.

903
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:32,001
So? You're hassled again, aren't you?

904
00:56:34,165 --> 00:56:35,432
lt's okay, buddy!

905
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:37,534
Just settle down somewhere.

906
00:56:37,966 --> 00:56:40,068
Draw in a deep, long breath.

907
00:56:40,899 --> 00:56:42,667
All the tension will
flow out of you. Right?

908
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:46,035
You need to do that more
than me. - l don't get tense.

909
00:56:46,099 --> 00:56:47,500
Why? Are you Superman?

910
00:56:47,566 --> 00:56:49,634
No, l really don't go for
red innerwear.

911
00:56:51,099 --> 00:56:52,500
Vey funny!

912
00:56:52,632 --> 00:56:55,434
Tension takes the nearest exit,
when it comes up against me.

913
00:56:55,899 --> 00:56:57,600
Oh, God!

914
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,067
What is it?
Why are you sniggering?

915
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:04,602
You are such a liar!
- Now, what did l do?

916
00:57:05,566 --> 00:57:09,102
Really? If you don't get tense,
what happened at Delhi Haat?

917
00:57:09,499 --> 00:57:10,266
What happened?

918
00:57:10,366 --> 00:57:13,535
You were looking for me and you
didn't find me. Didn't you get tense?

919
00:57:13,766 --> 00:57:15,501
Tense? Nothing doing.

920
00:57:15,733 --> 00:57:17,401
l have a picture.
Do you want to see it?

921
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:19,600
Oh, that?

922
00:57:19,766 --> 00:57:22,068
That was...
- Yes, that is it.

923
00:57:22,399 --> 00:57:25,101
What was all that about?
- That was...

924
00:57:25,632 --> 00:57:29,635
Admit it. When you didn't find me,
what you felt was tense.

925
00:57:29,733 --> 00:57:32,402
Why should l admit to something
that didn't happen? - Really?

926
00:57:32,466 --> 00:57:34,668
Of course. - Okay, can
l tell you something? - Yes.

927
00:57:34,766 --> 00:57:37,034
You are not what you seem to be.

928
00:57:37,265 --> 00:57:38,265
What do you mean?

929
00:57:38,366 --> 00:57:40,801
l mean, you calculate
your feelings so much!

930
00:57:40,866 --> 00:57:42,234
What do l calculate?

931
00:57:42,299 --> 00:57:46,069
You don't want the other person
to know that you are emotional.

932
00:57:47,232 --> 00:57:48,766
Don't ty to pretend you can
see it all!

933
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,369
What happened outside
the ATM, was really bad.

934
00:57:51,432 --> 00:57:54,334
l really felt bad, and l thought
l should say sory to you.

935
00:57:54,399 --> 00:57:56,033
You said, you're
going to Delhi Haat.

936
00:57:56,099 --> 00:57:58,534
So, l came there, to say sory
on behalf of the city.

937
00:57:58,599 --> 00:57:59,933
That's not such a big deal!

938
00:58:00,265 --> 00:58:04,102
Alright, then! At least you admit,
something did happen.

939
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:06,100
lf that's being tense, l was tense.
Okay?

940
00:58:06,666 --> 00:58:08,300
Happy now?

941
00:58:08,566 --> 00:58:09,733
Come on!

942
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:14,236
Why? Did l hurt your ego?

943
00:58:14,299 --> 00:58:16,200
My ego? What am l egotistic
about?

944
00:58:16,432 --> 00:58:18,534
Okay, let me tell you...
- l'll tell you something.

945
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:20,701
l iust don't like girls like you.

946
00:58:20,766 --> 00:58:22,868
Really? What kind of girls
do you like?

947
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:25,268
The kind who are timid?
The kind who burst into tears?

948
00:58:27,265 --> 00:58:28,366
Just a moment!

949
00:58:29,065 --> 00:58:30,633
That's in the past.

950
00:58:30,699 --> 00:58:32,934
And... eveyone is scared,
the first time.

951
00:58:33,032 --> 00:58:35,100
Really? So, does the second
time get any better?

952
00:58:35,265 --> 00:58:37,600
Excuse me, the second time
around, the girl was...

953
00:58:38,065 --> 00:58:39,433
What do you mean?

954
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,868
Was it a different girl,
the second time around?

955
00:58:42,332 --> 00:58:45,635
This is awesome, buddy!
- Listen, l am not a flirt!

956
00:58:46,933 --> 00:58:48,434
Come on, tell me her name.
- Whose name?

957
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:50,267
The second girl.

958
00:58:50,833 --> 00:58:51,967
Come on tell me.

959
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:57,333
Forget about it.

960
00:58:57,432 --> 00:58:59,233
Tell me!
- Just forget about it.

961
00:58:59,466 --> 00:59:01,501
See? You grilled me about my life.

962
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,033
When it comes to you...

963
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:06,234
l was right, you are not what
you seem to be.

964
00:59:06,299 --> 00:59:08,401
Do you know what that is called?
It's called being a hypocrite!

965
00:59:08,466 --> 00:59:10,301
You're a first class hypocrite!

966
00:59:13,099 --> 00:59:15,034
Sunchi.
- What?

967
00:59:17,299 --> 00:59:19,434
Sunchi.
- What's that?

968
00:59:20,899 --> 00:59:22,133
lt's a name.

969
00:59:23,232 --> 00:59:24,266
Whose name is it?

970
00:59:27,466 --> 00:59:28,700
The second girl.

971
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:31,333
My first true love.

972
00:59:32,399 --> 00:59:34,134
Sunchi?

973
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:41,867
What is it?

974
00:59:42,699 --> 00:59:44,067
Why are you laughing?

975
00:59:45,566 --> 00:59:48,669
Tell me!
Speak up! Why are you laughing?

976
00:59:52,099 --> 00:59:53,333
What is it?
Why are you laughing?

977
00:59:53,432 --> 00:59:54,633
Excuse me, why are you laughing?

978
00:59:54,699 --> 00:59:56,767
Were you born with a name tag
on your face?

979
00:59:57,699 --> 01:00:00,568
l'm sory. l'm really sory.

980
01:00:01,532 --> 01:00:04,101
l didn't expect it to be Sunchi.
- Look, this is a bit too much.

981
01:00:06,666 --> 01:00:07,633
l'm vey sory!

982
01:00:07,699 --> 01:00:09,100
Where did you meet Sunchi?

983
01:00:10,199 --> 01:00:13,001
At my friend's place. It was a
housewarming party. - Really?

984
01:00:13,766 --> 01:00:15,033
What's she like?

985
01:00:15,099 --> 01:00:16,767
She's nice.

986
01:00:17,866 --> 01:00:19,100
l think, she's beautiful.

987
01:00:19,299 --> 01:00:20,800
Really?
- Yes.

988
01:00:26,466 --> 01:00:30,036
Straight, silky hair.

989
01:00:31,466 --> 01:00:33,134
Twinkling eyes.

990
01:00:34,432 --> 01:00:35,866
Dimpled cheeks.

991
01:00:37,399 --> 01:00:38,767
She's slightly dark.

992
01:00:40,866 --> 01:00:42,500
She's quite goofy.

993
01:00:44,199 --> 01:00:47,068
She has a pert nose
and perFect teeth.

994
01:00:47,799 --> 01:00:52,103
And you know what?
Her lips always had a smile on them.

995
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,667
Like this.
- That is so amazing!

996
01:00:56,032 --> 01:00:59,001
Silky, straight hair,
twinkling eyes.

997
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:01,567
Something... what was that?

998
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:04,201
Dimpled cheeks.
- Yes!

999
01:01:05,032 --> 01:01:07,667
She liked my poems a lot.
- Really?

1000
01:01:07,866 --> 01:01:09,534
ln fact, she liked it
even more than me.

1001
01:01:12,466 --> 01:01:15,435
Now, that enough.
Just tone it down a bit.

1002
01:01:15,666 --> 01:01:18,502
What?
- You have a Japanese girlfriend!

1003
01:01:18,566 --> 01:01:21,135
l just can't digest that.
Now, you're a poet, too?

1004
01:01:21,232 --> 01:01:22,333
That's a bit too much to believe.

1005
01:01:22,499 --> 01:01:23,867
What?

1006
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,701
Can't Delhi folks compose poems?

1007
01:01:26,032 --> 01:01:28,968
You can do a lot. But, there is a
bit of a technical problem.

1008
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:30,366
What kind of a technical problem?

1009
01:01:30,532 --> 01:01:33,401
How did she understand
your poems?

1010
01:01:33,499 --> 01:01:35,100
Poety is all about the feel.

1011
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:39,937
Language is not needed
to feel the feel of poety.

1012
01:01:40,866 --> 01:01:44,636
Language is not needed
to feel the feel of poety!

1013
01:01:45,099 --> 01:01:48,202
That is so awesome, Goli!
That is such an amazing line!

1014
01:01:48,499 --> 01:01:51,168
Thanks.
- Okay, let's hear it. - What?

1015
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:53,801
A poem or two! Come on, let's
enjoy ourselves.

1016
01:01:55,466 --> 01:01:58,168
Enjoy ourselves?
- Yes! Go on!

1017
01:01:58,366 --> 01:02:00,634
lt's not done this way.
- Then, how is it done?

1018
01:02:01,866 --> 01:02:05,669
Evemhing has a certain mood.

1019
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:10,600
lt has a feel!

1020
01:02:10,933 --> 01:02:13,201
Okay, fine, now don't act pricey.
Let's hear it, Goli.

1021
01:02:13,699 --> 01:02:15,667
No.
- Come on, Goli!

1022
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:17,768
No!
- Goli, please!

1023
01:02:17,899 --> 01:02:19,233
No!

1024
01:02:20,599 --> 01:02:21,933
He's so arrogant!

1025
01:03:07,332 --> 01:03:15,006
''This ambience has stood still
since you've come close.''

1026
01:03:15,099 --> 01:03:22,439
''You've made me yours
in first sight.''

1027
01:03:22,766 --> 01:03:30,373
''Your feeling is touching my heart.''

1028
01:03:30,466 --> 01:03:38,073
''ls this a dream or
l'm falling in love?''

1029
01:03:57,232 --> 01:04:04,606
''l had never known what love is.''

1030
01:04:04,899 --> 01:04:12,539
''When l saw you,
l felt that you are my life.''

1031
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:19,939
''By coming in your arms l felt..

1032
01:04:20,232 --> 01:04:27,872
..like l got a new morning
to my nights.''

1033
01:05:37,299 --> 01:05:39,901
Wow! This is amazing, buddy.

1034
01:05:40,099 --> 01:05:42,067
Superb!
Fantastic!

1035
01:05:43,232 --> 01:05:47,202
You may look silly, foolish,
and dim-witted... - What?

1036
01:05:47,966 --> 01:05:49,867
...but, you're not!
You're really not. - Okay.

1037
01:05:49,933 --> 01:05:52,068
Have you always composed poety?

1038
01:05:52,399 --> 01:05:54,768
Or Sunchi inspired you to do it?

1039
01:05:55,699 --> 01:05:57,801
l think, l am a born poet.

1040
01:05:58,099 --> 01:06:00,468
l just started expressing it,
since she arrived.

1041
01:06:00,766 --> 01:06:02,467
You sing pretty well, too.

1042
01:06:02,933 --> 01:06:04,734
lt's just something l like
to do...

1043
01:06:05,532 --> 01:06:07,533
l didn't say you are
a fantastic singer.

1044
01:06:08,399 --> 01:06:10,768
Come on! You don't even let
me enjoy the praise.

1045
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,100
Why are you like this?

1046
01:06:13,065 --> 01:06:14,299
This is what l am like.

1047
01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:17,301
Okay, forget about it.
Tell me more. What is she like?

1048
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:20,500
lt's a weighty issue.

1049
01:06:21,265 --> 01:06:23,634
ls she fat?
That doesn't matter.

1050
01:06:23,966 --> 01:06:25,500
We'll get her into a slimming center.

1051
01:06:25,566 --> 01:06:27,334
After all, love is love.

1052
01:06:27,399 --> 01:06:30,802
Excuse me! l mean, there is
something about her. She's solid!

1053
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:32,833
Solid! Weighty?

1054
01:06:35,299 --> 01:06:36,333
But, seriously...

1055
01:06:36,466 --> 01:06:38,801
...vey few boys can compose
poety.

1056
01:06:38,866 --> 01:06:40,367
That too for their girlfriends.

1057
01:06:40,532 --> 01:06:43,101
You don't find boys who
really fall in love these days.

1058
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:44,800
Yes, girlsaren'tlikethat, either,
nOW.

1059
01:06:44,899 --> 01:06:46,734
lf you meet one, that's it.
If not, you don't.

1060
01:06:46,833 --> 01:06:48,768
l guess, it has something
to do with luck, too.

1061
01:06:48,866 --> 01:06:52,102
Yes, but girls are vey calculative
these days. - What do you mean?

1062
01:06:52,699 --> 01:06:55,301
l mean, they want to know what
you do, how much you earn.

1063
01:06:55,366 --> 01:06:56,834
How much money do you have
in your wallet?

1064
01:06:56,899 --> 01:06:59,501
That's what engages their
attention more, these days.

1065
01:06:59,733 --> 01:07:02,068
Why? l mean, isn't it practical?

1066
01:07:02,265 --> 01:07:05,501
Think about it. If l didn't have
extra money, this morning...

1067
01:07:06,032 --> 01:07:08,801
...what would have happened?
We would be washing the dishes.

1068
01:07:10,065 --> 01:07:12,867
You really do compose
vey nice poems.

1069
01:07:13,265 --> 01:07:15,233
But, you can't eat poety, right?

1070
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:20,734
But, what do you do?
- My dad runs his own business.

1071
01:07:21,332 --> 01:07:23,000
Spare parts?
- No!

1072
01:07:23,299 --> 01:07:24,533
lt's a transport business.

1073
01:07:25,232 --> 01:07:28,134
Okay, what does it feel like,
Iooking at me? - What do you mean?

1074
01:07:28,299 --> 01:07:30,834
l mean, who am l?

1075
01:07:31,265 --> 01:07:33,767
What do l do?
How educated am l?

1076
01:07:35,532 --> 01:07:37,033
No, no, you... no.

1077
01:07:37,099 --> 01:07:39,134
Don't say anything. You'll ruin
my self image in no time.

1078
01:07:39,232 --> 01:07:41,233
Just wait! Hey, listen to me.

1079
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:43,334
Listen to me.

1080
01:07:44,299 --> 01:07:45,833
At least give me a hand.

1081
01:07:55,099 --> 01:07:56,967
Tell me, what do you do?

1082
01:07:57,833 --> 01:07:59,000
l am studying to be
a CA (chartered accountant).

1083
01:07:59,099 --> 01:08:01,201
You're still studying, right?
It's not over yet.

1084
01:08:01,432 --> 01:08:03,634
Just doing the work is bad enough.

1085
01:08:03,699 --> 01:08:05,200
There is a one percent result.

1086
01:08:05,265 --> 01:08:07,400
That's amazing! You've got
an attitude, without the degree!

1087
01:08:07,499 --> 01:08:09,601
With the degree, you will conquer
the world.

1088
01:08:10,065 --> 01:08:11,866
l could do that, even without
the degree.

1089
01:08:11,966 --> 01:08:13,767
But, what will you do,
after you get the degree?

1090
01:08:13,833 --> 01:08:16,101
You just have to run
your dad's business.

1091
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:18,167
Attitude!
- Attitude?

1092
01:08:18,265 --> 01:08:20,200
You're going to do the degree
just to have some attitude!

1093
01:08:20,265 --> 01:08:22,667
What an inspiration, buddy!
Attitude!

1094
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:24,834
l make the trends,
and set the standard.

1095
01:08:24,933 --> 01:08:28,069
l gather all these trivial
degrees just like that.

1096
01:08:28,299 --> 01:08:30,167
Degrees!
- Yes. - Wow!

1097
01:08:30,265 --> 01:08:32,433
What a word!
Degrees!

1098
01:08:32,499 --> 01:08:33,800
That's part of my attitude, too!

1099
01:08:34,032 --> 01:08:36,100
ls there anyone who doesn't
have an attitude in life?

1100
01:08:36,265 --> 01:08:37,633
Yes, there is someone.
- Who is it?

1101
01:08:37,699 --> 01:08:38,833
You are!

1102
01:08:57,566 --> 01:09:00,368
Go ahead and laugh.
Why did you stop? Laugh!

1103
01:09:01,299 --> 01:09:03,067
No, l've laughed as much
as l wanted to.

1104
01:09:03,833 --> 01:09:05,334
May l give you
my frank opinion?

1105
01:09:05,499 --> 01:09:08,835
The principle of ajoke is, that when
you joke, the other should laugh.

1106
01:09:08,966 --> 01:09:11,835
You don't crack ajoke and laugh
at it, okay?

1107
01:09:13,499 --> 01:09:15,000
Okay, Aunt.
l will remember that.

1108
01:09:15,432 --> 01:09:17,433
Aunt? l'm going to hit you, now.

1109
01:09:19,966 --> 01:09:20,966
Come on.

1110
01:09:26,766 --> 01:09:27,766
So?

1111
01:09:28,366 --> 01:09:30,301
Where is Sunchi?
- In my heart.

1112
01:09:31,165 --> 01:09:33,467
l mean, did you mary her?

1113
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:38,833
Why?

1114
01:09:40,432 --> 01:09:41,533
Just like that.

1115
01:09:42,099 --> 01:09:43,099
lt didn't work out.

1116
01:09:43,699 --> 01:09:45,167
You made her cy, too?

1117
01:09:46,332 --> 01:09:48,000
No! It's not like that.

1118
01:09:48,366 --> 01:09:50,835
Buddy, what do you do to
the girls?

1119
01:09:51,666 --> 01:09:53,501
l told you, it's not like that.

1120
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,634
l know, l'm iust kidding.

1121
01:09:55,766 --> 01:09:57,400
Okay. Better.

1122
01:09:57,966 --> 01:10:00,635
l bet, you didn't like anyone
besides Sunchi.

1123
01:10:07,599 --> 01:10:10,835
l think, you are too loyal
to your emotions, right?

1124
01:10:13,666 --> 01:10:15,868
l don't know. l didn't
find anyone else.

1125
01:10:16,332 --> 01:10:17,966
l bet you didn't look.

1126
01:10:22,299 --> 01:10:24,067
Can you find all this,
if you look for it?

1127
01:10:26,199 --> 01:10:28,234
They say, you could find
God, if you looked.

1128
01:10:29,833 --> 01:10:31,734
Love, passion and romance...

1129
01:10:34,265 --> 01:10:36,100
...is something that happens
all of a sudden.

1130
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:38,067
lt iust happens.

1131
01:10:41,265 --> 01:10:44,067
You don't look at all emotional!

1132
01:10:45,265 --> 01:10:47,600
Do the ones who are emotional
cary a placard that announces it?

1133
01:10:51,265 --> 01:10:54,001
What's Arnav like?

1134
01:10:56,933 --> 01:10:58,467
Sory, sory!

1135
01:10:58,699 --> 01:11:00,600
You were talking to your mom.
So...

1136
01:11:00,766 --> 01:11:02,634
l heard you.
l have vey good hearing.

1137
01:11:04,632 --> 01:11:06,133
Shall we go?
Can we leave?

1138
01:11:09,432 --> 01:11:10,466
Listen to me!

1139
01:11:11,132 --> 01:11:13,167
Why are you running away?
- l am getting late.

1140
01:11:13,332 --> 01:11:16,334
l mean, about Arnav.
- l don't want to talk about that.

1141
01:11:16,666 --> 01:11:17,666
This isn't fair.

1142
01:11:17,733 --> 01:11:19,935
l told you, evemhing. And you
won't talk about yourself.

1143
01:11:25,399 --> 01:11:26,433
We broke up.

1144
01:11:28,265 --> 01:11:30,600
Oh. l am sory.

1145
01:11:31,599 --> 01:11:32,866
Why are you sory?

1146
01:11:34,232 --> 01:11:35,766
You're supposed to say that.

1147
01:11:36,499 --> 01:11:38,067
What happened?
Did you have a fight?

1148
01:11:38,366 --> 01:11:40,167
Let's about something else.
Please?

1149
01:11:47,065 --> 01:11:49,233
Listen, say sory to him.

1150
01:11:49,332 --> 01:11:52,368
You can patch up with him.
- Thanks, but it's okay.

1151
01:11:52,699 --> 01:11:56,102
Hey, tell him you're here
to meet a boy. He'll get scared.

1152
01:11:58,899 --> 01:12:02,402
Sory. Boys get insecure
because of all this.

1153
01:12:05,032 --> 01:12:07,467
Should l talk to him?
l'm good at hook ups.

1154
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:10,234
Will you keep quiet?

1155
01:12:10,432 --> 01:12:12,267
l am iust tying to help you!

1156
01:12:14,833 --> 01:12:17,202
Did l ask you for help?
Did l?

1157
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:18,933
Why are you iust...

1158
01:12:19,532 --> 01:12:22,468
You lose your temper over
any little thing. Are you insane?

1159
01:12:22,933 --> 01:12:24,567
Yes, l am insane.
Happy now?

1160
01:12:25,766 --> 01:12:27,367
That's good. Both of them are
saved the trouble.

1161
01:12:28,065 --> 01:12:31,234
Who do you mean? - The boy
in Mumbai and the one here.

1162
01:12:31,699 --> 01:12:33,467
Who are you going to mary now?

1163
01:12:33,566 --> 01:12:36,535
Will you keep quiet?
You joke about evemhing!

1164
01:12:41,499 --> 01:12:43,067
Hey! Hey you!

1165
01:12:43,265 --> 01:12:45,934
You've been mocking me
since morning. Did l say a word?

1166
01:12:46,099 --> 01:12:48,801
Now that l have mocked you,
you want me to be quiet!

1167
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,469
This is okay, between friends.

1168
01:12:58,566 --> 01:12:59,900
Not always.

1169
01:13:00,165 --> 01:13:03,067
There is a time, a place
and a mood for ajoke.

1170
01:13:03,466 --> 01:13:05,000
You can't crack
jokes about evey little thing.

1171
01:13:05,099 --> 01:13:08,969
Think, before you open your mouth
to chatter.

1172
01:13:09,299 --> 01:13:10,800
Someone may feel hurt.

1173
01:13:11,099 --> 01:13:13,801
lf a person doesn't want to talk
about something, just understand.

1174
01:13:14,165 --> 01:13:16,267
Ty to understand what kind of
problem he is facing.

1175
01:13:16,366 --> 01:13:18,101
How would l know what's the problem?

1176
01:13:19,432 --> 01:13:21,100
How well do we know each other?

1177
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:25,168
You crack ajoke and it's fun.
If l do that, it bothers you.

1178
01:13:25,499 --> 01:13:28,201
Please keep this Mumbai style
practicality to yourself, okay?

1179
01:13:28,933 --> 01:13:31,402
Just be quiet.
- You keep quiet, okay?

1180
01:13:33,799 --> 01:13:36,735
What a major piece of attitude!
Who do you think you are?

1181
01:13:37,432 --> 01:13:40,668
You can go and dominate
over your precious Arnav.

1182
01:13:40,966 --> 01:13:43,101
We don't listen to anyone here.

1183
01:13:43,566 --> 01:13:45,000
What are you glaring at?

1184
01:13:45,566 --> 01:13:48,702
l feel like going to their
house and telling their parents...

1185
01:13:49,099 --> 01:13:51,134
...that they should lots
of charity...

1186
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:53,901
...since their sons have been spared
the trouble of being married to you.

1187
01:13:54,199 --> 01:13:56,367
You've been cramping my style
since the morning!

1188
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:58,700
Just tone down your attitude
a bit, okay?

1189
01:13:59,232 --> 01:14:01,267
What? What do you know
about me?

1190
01:14:01,366 --> 01:14:02,600
l would know, if you told me!

1191
01:14:02,733 --> 01:14:03,934
Why should l tell you?

1192
01:14:04,032 --> 01:14:05,867
Don't tell me!
l don't care!

1193
01:14:12,833 --> 01:14:16,069
She's iust chattering all the time.

1194
01:14:16,532 --> 01:14:17,532
Let's go, now.

1195
01:14:22,499 --> 01:14:25,235
Oh, no!
She's cying!

1196
01:14:26,299 --> 01:14:28,834
Goli, do something.
What will you do, now?

1197
01:14:29,366 --> 01:14:30,734
Do something!
Do something...

1198
01:14:31,165 --> 01:14:33,200
Listen! Look here.

1199
01:14:33,632 --> 01:14:36,868
Turn towards me.

1200
01:14:36,966 --> 01:14:40,302
Turn towards me!
Why are you cying?

1201
01:14:40,699 --> 01:14:41,733
You're cying?

1202
01:14:43,332 --> 01:14:44,733
l was iust ioking!

1203
01:14:45,099 --> 01:14:46,600
l'm a funny guy!

1204
01:14:48,899 --> 01:14:52,102
Okay, wipe your tissue with
your tears.

1205
01:14:52,165 --> 01:14:54,200
l mean, wipe your tears
with your tissue.

1206
01:14:54,265 --> 01:14:55,666
Please stop cying.

1207
01:14:55,733 --> 01:14:58,402
Listen, l won't talk to you,
if you don't stop cying.

1208
01:14:59,699 --> 01:15:00,866
Please stop cying!

1209
01:15:00,966 --> 01:15:03,768
My parents don't take me seriously!
Why are you doing that?

1210
01:15:04,165 --> 01:15:06,567
That's the problem with boys.
- What is it?

1211
01:15:08,032 --> 01:15:09,733
You blurt out the first
thing that comes to your mind.

1212
01:15:09,833 --> 01:15:11,668
Then, you'll say, l was ioking!

1213
01:15:12,232 --> 01:15:13,866
Nothing is ever right.

1214
01:15:14,199 --> 01:15:15,533
All of you are the same.

1215
01:15:15,799 --> 01:15:17,667
You have hot tempers,
you have fragile egos!

1216
01:15:17,733 --> 01:15:19,835
You don't believe the other
person is worth anything.

1217
01:15:20,232 --> 01:15:23,368
But, things will get sorted out
if we talk.

1218
01:15:23,833 --> 01:15:27,903
Sory, there are some things
to which l can't react.

1219
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:30,867
Can l say something?

1220
01:15:33,432 --> 01:15:34,466
Share it.

1221
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:52,102
Arnav and l were in love.

1222
01:15:55,132 --> 01:15:58,101
We had minor fights, during
a three year relationship.

1223
01:16:02,532 --> 01:16:05,101
At first we used to say
sory to each other.

1224
01:16:09,032 --> 01:16:11,667
Then, after some time, l said sory
more often than him.

1225
01:16:14,599 --> 01:16:16,434
Then, l was the only one
who said sory.

1226
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:20,333
Whether it was my fault or not.

1227
01:16:25,099 --> 01:16:27,634
One day, we argued about some movie.

1228
01:16:30,265 --> 01:16:31,499
lt got out of hand.

1229
01:16:35,366 --> 01:16:38,635
He got upset and, he took a rickshaw
and he left.

1230
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:45,768
l was not expecting this.

1231
01:16:48,766 --> 01:16:51,969
l waited for him to come back.

1232
01:16:55,666 --> 01:16:56,967
But, he didn't come back.

1233
01:16:59,366 --> 01:17:00,800
l don't know why...

1234
01:17:02,833 --> 01:17:04,701
...l wasn't able to say sory to him.

1235
01:17:12,032 --> 01:17:14,467
l guess, he didn't know how to get
angy or cajole someone.

1236
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:20,067
Perhaps, he was waiting
to go away from me.

1237
01:17:22,632 --> 01:17:24,467
When he found a chance, he ran
away.

1238
01:17:31,799 --> 01:17:33,100
Listen to me.

1239
01:17:34,599 --> 01:17:36,334
Don't wory.
l am alright.

1240
01:17:37,666 --> 01:17:40,235
Yes. But, listen to me.

1241
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:42,600
l don't need your sympathy.

1242
01:17:43,366 --> 01:17:44,700
No, l am...

1243
01:17:45,966 --> 01:17:48,902
An_ay, boys are like that.
- Like what?

1244
01:17:50,466 --> 01:17:53,101
Offer your shoulder,
if the girl is in tears.

1245
01:17:53,566 --> 01:17:55,000
Give her some sympathy.

1246
01:17:55,632 --> 01:17:57,166
l don't want that.
- l...

1247
01:17:57,566 --> 01:17:59,901
l can manage myself.
Seriously.

1248
01:18:01,065 --> 01:18:02,866
Shall we go?
We're getting late.

1249
01:18:26,799 --> 01:18:32,037
Goli, if you don't mind,
can l use your phone again.

1250
01:18:32,432 --> 01:18:34,267
Actually, l need to make a call
if you don't mind.

1251
01:18:34,366 --> 01:18:35,567
Yes, go ahead.

1252
01:18:35,733 --> 01:18:37,367
Go ahead and do it,
l'll be right back.

1253
01:18:37,566 --> 01:18:38,833
Where are you going?

1254
01:19:14,132 --> 01:19:16,067
So, did you speak?

1255
01:19:16,332 --> 01:19:17,866
He's so busy...

1256
01:19:25,399 --> 01:19:29,870
l know what you were
going to say!

1257
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:31,933
What?
What was l going to say?

1258
01:19:35,466 --> 01:19:36,667
Yes, alright, l know!

1259
01:19:41,466 --> 01:19:44,202
lt happens. Sometimes.
- Of course.

1260
01:19:55,366 --> 01:19:57,801
Do you remember the last
time you were serious?

1261
01:19:58,232 --> 01:20:01,702
l was a bit serious in the seventh
grade, when l failed in math.

1262
01:20:02,199 --> 01:20:03,934
Even then, you were just a bit
serious?

1263
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:05,867
Shame on you! Didn't your
dad thrash you?

1264
01:20:05,966 --> 01:20:07,334
My mom used to thrash me.

1265
01:20:07,399 --> 01:20:09,067
Dad still protects me.

1266
01:20:09,599 --> 01:20:11,968
But, how could you fail?

1267
01:20:12,232 --> 01:20:14,334
l couldn't help it. The boy
sitting in front of me, didn't study.

1268
01:20:35,866 --> 01:20:37,100
Can l say something?

1269
01:20:38,632 --> 01:20:41,735
You look vey good when you
smile.

1270
01:20:57,332 --> 01:20:58,332
Listen to me!

1271
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:03,733
Tell me something.

1272
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:05,234
Why didn't things work
out with Sunchi?

1273
01:21:05,299 --> 01:21:07,267
l mean, that's if you want
to tell me.

1274
01:21:09,466 --> 01:21:10,834
My family wasn't ready.

1275
01:21:10,933 --> 01:21:12,401
Evemhing changes, you know.

1276
01:21:12,532 --> 01:21:15,167
The culture, the lifestyle,
evemhing. - So what?

1277
01:21:16,766 --> 01:21:18,634
So, l explained it to them.
l convinced them.

1278
01:21:18,866 --> 01:21:20,534
They did agree, for my sake.
- Then what?

1279
01:21:21,599 --> 01:21:24,735
Then, Sunchi created a problem.
- What?

1280
01:21:25,532 --> 01:21:28,067
She began to say, she won't live
with my parents. - Then what?

1281
01:21:28,599 --> 01:21:31,034
l said no. That's not done.
- Why?

1282
01:21:31,532 --> 01:21:34,301
Why?
- That's normal, these days.

1283
01:21:34,799 --> 01:21:36,534
And it is right, too?
- How is it right?

1284
01:21:37,399 --> 01:21:41,169
Separate out, before you have
fights after the wedding.

1285
01:21:41,599 --> 01:21:43,567
That preserves
the honor of both families.

1286
01:21:43,966 --> 01:21:46,635
Technically, it's just
one separate house.

1287
01:21:47,032 --> 01:21:49,734
Your own space.
The relationships don't change.

1288
01:21:59,032 --> 01:22:01,167
Did you and Arnav
fight about this, too?

1289
01:22:03,165 --> 01:22:04,833
No. We were vey clear
about those issues.

1290
01:22:04,899 --> 01:22:06,066
Then what happened?

1291
01:22:07,866 --> 01:22:10,101
l guess, we weren't clear about
other things.

1292
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:12,267
lt's vey easy for you to
say all that.

1293
01:22:13,099 --> 01:22:15,167
No, it's really vey difficult.

1294
01:22:15,599 --> 01:22:16,866
But, this is life.

1295
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:20,568
lt's better to separate in time,
so you don't regret it later.

1296
01:22:21,032 --> 01:22:23,667
Perhaps, that's why most marriages
work out, these days.

1297
01:22:24,733 --> 01:22:28,236
lf someone tells you how
a suspense film ends, first...

1298
01:22:28,299 --> 01:22:30,000
...would you ever watch the entire
film?

1299
01:22:30,099 --> 01:22:31,867
No, that would be so boring!

1300
01:22:32,099 --> 01:22:34,468
Exactly! That's what it is!

1301
01:22:34,733 --> 01:22:37,802
l mean, just think.
The boy and girl meet each other.

1302
01:22:38,432 --> 01:22:39,633
Then, they talk to each other.

1303
01:22:39,966 --> 01:22:41,267
Then, they meet more and more.

1304
01:22:41,632 --> 01:22:42,899
Then, they roam around together.

1305
01:22:43,099 --> 01:22:45,968
Then, that first touch
which happens by chance.

1306
01:22:46,032 --> 01:22:47,433
How romantic is that?

1307
01:22:48,099 --> 01:22:49,967
Then, the love that comes
because of that touch.

1308
01:22:50,232 --> 01:22:52,067
Blushing, smiling.

1309
01:22:52,232 --> 01:22:56,569
Then, to know what it feels like
to touch after the wedding.

1310
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,569
These days, people don't even
wait to get acquainted.

1311
01:23:00,799 --> 01:23:02,834
ln fact, they even ask the name
Iater!

1312
01:23:02,899 --> 01:23:04,433
lt's all high speed!

1313
01:23:04,833 --> 01:23:06,267
That's the end of the stoy.

1314
01:23:07,332 --> 01:23:09,901
lf the boy and girl
really love each other...

1315
01:23:10,265 --> 01:23:12,934
...they have to have something
to look forward to.

1316
01:23:13,499 --> 01:23:17,436
You could live an entire life, tying
to figure things out, gradually.

1317
01:23:18,399 --> 01:23:20,467
lf you figure it all out,
beforehand...

1318
01:23:20,532 --> 01:23:22,400
...no one waits
to hear the whole stoy.

1319
01:23:23,032 --> 01:23:26,268
There is no excitement
these days. Thus, there's no stoy.

1320
01:23:26,733 --> 01:23:28,334
You have to have chemisty.

1321
01:23:28,499 --> 01:23:31,735
lf the physics and biology follows
Iater, things could get better.

1322
01:23:44,766 --> 01:23:46,567
l knew, you'd laugh at me.

1323
01:23:47,032 --> 01:23:48,633
You'll find me old fashioned,
right?

1324
01:23:49,032 --> 01:23:50,566
But, it's a fact, you know?

1325
01:23:51,065 --> 01:23:54,101
Perhaps, that's why our
parents' marriages are still strong.

1326
01:23:54,332 --> 01:23:56,434
And some friends already
have broken marriages.

1327
01:23:56,899 --> 01:23:58,433
Can l say something?
- Sure.

1328
01:23:59,699 --> 01:24:01,600
Whenever you get married...

1329
01:24:02,065 --> 01:24:03,699
...you won't let it break up.

1330
01:24:06,532 --> 01:24:08,166
You will be a great husband.

1331
01:24:09,366 --> 01:24:12,535
Evey mom would like her
daughter to have a husband like you.

1332
01:24:16,232 --> 01:24:18,567
Now, can l say something?
- Go ahead.

1333
01:24:19,265 --> 01:24:21,266
Forget it.
- No, tell me!

1334
01:24:22,099 --> 01:24:24,801
What's the use?
You said, you don't want to mary.

1335
01:24:26,165 --> 01:24:27,199
l didn't say that.

1336
01:24:27,265 --> 01:24:29,734
What? Didn't you say so
at the Chole Bhature joint?

1337
01:24:29,833 --> 01:24:31,434
l don't believe in this institution?

1338
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:34,034
Yes, that's my opinion,
not my decision.

1339
01:24:34,299 --> 01:24:35,466
That's amazing!

1340
01:24:35,599 --> 01:24:37,167
One can't be sure, when it comes
to you.

1341
01:24:38,065 --> 01:24:40,033
l find it really difficult to
understand myself, too.

1342
01:24:40,299 --> 01:24:43,035
The day l do, l will call up
and tell you.

1343
01:24:43,399 --> 01:24:44,399
Shall we go?

1344
01:24:47,032 --> 01:24:48,566
Listen to me!
- Yes, tell me.

1345
01:24:48,799 --> 01:24:50,834
Why don't you wait?
- Why don't you tell me what it is?

1346
01:24:50,933 --> 01:24:54,636
Divine Mother, grant this
girl some sense, please.

1347
01:25:42,099 --> 01:25:44,701
Wow! Which Sikh temple is this?

1348
01:25:44,899 --> 01:25:47,668
Bangla Sahib. It's the biggest
Sikh temple in Delhi.

1349
01:25:48,499 --> 01:25:49,733
Shall we go in?

1350
01:25:52,933 --> 01:25:55,802
Let's go, girl. You can eat
some offerings today.

1351
01:25:56,099 --> 01:25:58,267
l'll make sure all your bitterness
turns sweet, today.

1352
01:28:31,165 --> 01:28:33,000
You don't seem to be all that
religious.

1353
01:28:34,132 --> 01:28:37,702
Really? Do those who are religious,
cary a placard to announce it?

1354
01:28:40,432 --> 01:28:41,833
Can l tell you something?

1355
01:28:42,599 --> 01:28:45,601
They say if you worship
at Bangla Sahib...

1356
01:28:45,666 --> 01:28:47,934
...all your wishes will come true.

1357
01:28:50,766 --> 01:28:52,501
You must have wished
for something.

1358
01:28:56,699 --> 01:28:58,133
Alright, l'll get the bike.

1359
01:28:59,666 --> 01:29:00,666
Listen.

1360
01:29:02,699 --> 01:29:04,000
Let's have a cup of coffee.

1361
01:29:06,032 --> 01:29:07,032
Sure.

1362
01:29:08,666 --> 01:29:10,768
But, decide up front who
is going to pay the bill.

1363
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:34,199
Thanks.

1364
01:29:35,766 --> 01:29:38,401
Give us an extra packet of
sugar, please. Thank you.

1365
01:29:42,966 --> 01:29:45,768
So? Who is your favorite leading man?

1366
01:29:46,466 --> 01:29:47,466
You are.

1367
01:29:47,899 --> 01:29:49,433
What are you saying?
Is that true?

1368
01:29:51,432 --> 01:29:53,200
Don't you understand aioke?

1369
01:29:54,032 --> 01:29:55,600
Delhi folks are all naive.

1370
01:29:55,666 --> 01:29:57,601
Delhi folks are cannonballs!

1371
01:29:57,666 --> 01:29:59,968
What about Bombay folks?
- It's Mumbai.

1372
01:30:00,265 --> 01:30:01,566
lt's the same thing.

1373
01:30:01,833 --> 01:30:04,702
No! Bombay was the brother.

1374
01:30:06,165 --> 01:30:07,466
And is Mumbai the sister?

1375
01:30:08,966 --> 01:30:11,068
lt's Aai.
That means, the mother.

1376
01:30:11,232 --> 01:30:13,867
For example, if you ask the
mother for something, you get it.

1377
01:30:14,466 --> 01:30:17,302
lt's just like that.
The city of dreams, Mumbai.

1378
01:30:25,666 --> 01:30:27,000
Tell me something.

1379
01:30:30,299 --> 01:30:31,767
What is it?
- Buddy!

1380
01:30:33,099 --> 01:30:34,400
Are you alright?

1381
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,203
l mean, you are actually asking?
l'm going to pass out.

1382
01:30:39,432 --> 01:30:43,068
No, l just thought, it's personal.
So, l should ask first.

1383
01:30:43,532 --> 01:30:46,468
Go ahead and ask.
l'm in a generous mood.

1384
01:30:54,833 --> 01:30:56,334
This guy of yours...

1385
01:30:57,799 --> 01:30:59,834
...the one you came to meet
so you can mary him...

1386
01:31:00,666 --> 01:31:03,568
...l mean, you have come to say
no to mary him.

1387
01:31:03,632 --> 01:31:04,632
Right.

1388
01:31:06,165 --> 01:31:07,533
ls that because of Arnav?

1389
01:31:17,666 --> 01:31:19,367
You were with me, all day long.

1390
01:31:20,232 --> 01:31:23,101
Did you miss Arnav in that 'missing'
kind of way?

1391
01:31:31,966 --> 01:31:36,203
''The moment changed
and the season changed.''

1392
01:31:41,566 --> 01:31:47,238
''Yesterday it was colorFul,
why is it quiet today?''

1393
01:31:50,532 --> 01:31:54,936
''O traveler, it is your wish.''

1394
01:31:55,399 --> 01:32:00,337
''You write your destiny.''

1395
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:09,808
''This life is for a moment.
Let me live it evey day.''

1396
01:32:12,699 --> 01:32:17,203
''O traveler, listen to my stoy.''

1397
01:32:17,566 --> 01:32:22,337
''l'm reaching the destination
which is in the sky.''

1398
01:32:22,399 --> 01:32:27,103
''O traveler, listen to my stoy.''

1399
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:32,837
''A little confused
and little crazy.''

1400
01:32:32,899 --> 01:32:37,036
''O traveler.''

1401
01:32:39,699 --> 01:32:42,068
See? You still have an hour
and a half to go.

1402
01:32:43,733 --> 01:32:44,767
Yes.

1403
01:32:45,099 --> 01:32:47,835
So? Your trip to Delhi was wasted.

1404
01:32:48,032 --> 01:32:50,801
Not exactly. l did meet you.

1405
01:32:52,332 --> 01:32:53,633
You bet.

1406
01:32:54,399 --> 01:32:55,600
Did you believe that?

1407
01:32:58,599 --> 01:32:59,866
Okay, l'm sory!

1408
01:33:00,399 --> 01:33:02,934
l know you've been really hassled
because of me. Right?

1409
01:33:03,532 --> 01:33:06,534
lt's okay. Hassles come
and go.

1410
01:33:07,099 --> 01:33:10,969
Hey, you!
You should lie and say, it's okay.

1411
01:33:11,165 --> 01:33:14,434
Lie? Excuse me, Delhi folks
never lie.

1412
01:33:14,799 --> 01:33:15,833
So, tell me the truth, then!

1413
01:33:15,899 --> 01:33:17,500
l am telling the truth.

1414
01:33:17,566 --> 01:33:20,769
l have been hassled a lot
all through the day.

1415
01:33:26,966 --> 01:33:28,400
lt was nice meeting you, buddy.

1416
01:33:30,799 --> 01:33:34,102
So, should l leave?
- Okay, then. See you.

1417
01:33:35,265 --> 01:33:36,366
Again?

1418
01:33:41,132 --> 01:33:43,467
Be quiet.
- Okay, bye.

1419
01:33:44,532 --> 01:33:45,699
Yes!

1420
01:33:48,666 --> 01:33:49,900
See you.

1421
01:34:25,866 --> 01:34:26,866
Oh!

1422
01:34:32,666 --> 01:34:33,833
Hello? Who's this?

1423
01:34:34,165 --> 01:34:36,333
l got a call from this number.
May l know who is this?

1424
01:34:37,933 --> 01:34:41,269
Actually, l am sory.
This is Goli's phone.

1425
01:34:41,432 --> 01:34:43,734
lt got left behind with me.
l thought, it must be for him.

1426
01:34:44,065 --> 01:34:45,099
Who's Goli?

1427
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,434
He's my friend.

1428
01:34:48,199 --> 01:34:50,200
May l know who is on the line?
- This is Siddharth.

1429
01:34:50,532 --> 01:34:54,435
Oh, hi, Siddharth! This is Piya.
Neelam Singh's daughter.

1430
01:34:55,366 --> 01:34:56,600
l was in Delhi.

1431
01:34:56,766 --> 01:34:58,534
Actually, l came to meet you.

1432
01:34:58,632 --> 01:35:00,900
Sory, l was really caught up.

1433
01:35:00,966 --> 01:35:03,101
My phone was out of coverage.
Where are you right now?

1434
01:35:03,165 --> 01:35:04,165
l'm at the airport.

1435
01:35:04,232 --> 01:35:07,835
Well, l just spoke to your mom.
She said the flight is at 6:45 PM.

1436
01:35:07,933 --> 01:35:12,103
Yes. - l will call you in ten minutes.
Let's meet if you have the time.

1437
01:35:13,499 --> 01:35:15,868
Okay, l'll meet you outside
Terminal 1-D.

1438
01:35:15,933 --> 01:35:17,401
But, l have only ten minutes.

1439
01:35:17,499 --> 01:35:21,603
Okay, l'll be there in ten minutes.
But, if you pass me l'll stop at once.

1440
01:35:21,666 --> 01:35:22,666
Okay.

1441
01:35:35,366 --> 01:35:37,101
Goli!
- Hey!

1442
01:35:37,399 --> 01:35:39,200
l'm glad l met you!
You have my phone.

1443
01:35:39,265 --> 01:35:41,700
l'm glad l met you.
Here is your phone.

1444
01:35:41,866 --> 01:35:43,067
lt got left behind by mistake.

1445
01:35:43,165 --> 01:35:44,432
l thought, l'd lost my phone.

1446
01:35:44,666 --> 01:35:46,634
l am sory! It was a mistake.

1447
01:35:46,899 --> 01:35:48,300
Okay, you know what?
- What?

1448
01:35:48,366 --> 01:35:50,101
He is coming here, too.
- Who do you mean?

1449
01:35:52,933 --> 01:35:55,702
What? That fool?
How come?

1450
01:35:56,866 --> 01:35:59,268
l called from your phone, right?
- Yes.

1451
01:35:59,332 --> 01:36:00,666
So, he called me.

1452
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:02,934
He sounded really nice.

1453
01:36:03,032 --> 01:36:05,834
lt seems, you are going to get
hitched today!

1454
01:36:06,966 --> 01:36:08,934
Oh come on! Give me a break.

1455
01:36:09,099 --> 01:36:10,333
What's the big deal?

1456
01:36:10,432 --> 01:36:12,433
Fate can change in aiiffy these days.

1457
01:36:12,566 --> 01:36:14,935
What if the other guy
is decent? Will you still say no?

1458
01:36:15,032 --> 01:36:17,067
Yes, l would still say no.

1459
01:36:17,132 --> 01:36:18,333
Oh, no! Why?

1460
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:21,301
You can't decide who to
mary at the airport.

1461
01:36:21,366 --> 01:36:24,502
lt's about the heart. It can happen
anywhere! What's wrong with that?

1462
01:36:25,099 --> 01:36:28,168
Buddy, l think we are heading
for another fight.

1463
01:36:28,599 --> 01:36:30,834
So, we should be quiet.
What do you think?

1464
01:36:30,899 --> 01:36:32,433
Alright, fine!
l don't care.

1465
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,203
Where is this guy?
It's already over ten minutes.

1466
01:36:39,366 --> 01:36:41,167
Call him and ask him!

1467
01:36:44,432 --> 01:36:46,200
Call him from my phone.

1468
01:36:46,499 --> 01:36:48,367
Now we are friends.
l won't charge you for it.

1469
01:36:56,899 --> 01:36:57,899
Thanks.

1470
01:37:12,065 --> 01:37:13,065
What is it?

1471
01:37:13,866 --> 01:37:16,468
His phone is always busy!

1472
01:37:16,733 --> 01:37:17,967
How silly!

1473
01:37:19,733 --> 01:37:21,000
You are silly.

1474
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:24,467
You can't dial the same number
from the same instrument.

1475
01:37:28,899 --> 01:37:30,867
You're dialing my phone
from my number.

1476
01:37:33,065 --> 01:37:34,266
lt is bound to be busy.

1477
01:37:53,966 --> 01:37:55,567
Hi, l'm Siddharth.

1478
01:37:55,966 --> 01:37:57,467
Also known as Goli Kohli.

1479
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,801
Son of G.S and Sunita Kohli.

1480
01:38:07,532 --> 01:38:10,635
The boy who said yes, just
by looking at your photo.

1481
01:38:11,799 --> 01:38:14,601
And, now that l have met you...

1482
01:38:15,332 --> 01:38:16,733
...after talking to you...

1483
01:38:17,399 --> 01:38:19,667
...and now that l understand
the other person well...

1484
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,768
...l swear by the Divine Mother...

1485
01:38:22,165 --> 01:38:24,033
...my inner human
is telling me...

1486
01:38:24,466 --> 01:38:28,403
...that you are just as l thought
you would be, from the picture.

1487
01:38:48,199 --> 01:38:51,168
Why are you hitting me?

1488
01:38:52,432 --> 01:38:55,201
People are looking at us!
- Goli! - What are you doing?

1489
01:38:55,299 --> 01:38:58,301
Why did you have to do all that?
Why didn't you tell me, before?

1490
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:00,467
What are you doing?
People are looking at us!

1491
01:39:01,699 --> 01:39:03,467
You've wasted my entire day!

1492
01:39:13,165 --> 01:39:15,734
Swear to me, that l wasted
your entire day!

1493
01:39:26,699 --> 01:39:27,699
Tell me!

1494
01:39:28,632 --> 01:39:30,033
Did l really waste your time?

1495
01:40:00,966 --> 01:40:01,966
Piya.

1496
01:40:09,099 --> 01:40:10,500
Will you mary me?

1497
01:40:18,866 --> 01:40:23,070
Goli! What are you doing?
People are looking at us! Get up!

1498
01:40:23,132 --> 01:40:25,200
lt's okay, we'll invite them
to our wedding.

1499
01:40:25,733 --> 01:40:27,768
Are you insane?
l said, get up.

1500
01:40:29,099 --> 01:40:30,767
Tell me, will you mary me?

1501
01:40:32,065 --> 01:40:34,367
You want a rickshaw?
l'm a rickshaw driver.

1502
01:40:36,199 --> 01:40:39,035
You've ruined my entire day!
- What?

1503
01:40:39,432 --> 01:40:41,534
You rascal! Thief!

1504
01:40:41,933 --> 01:40:44,669
Delhi is infamous because
of people like you.

1505
01:40:45,032 --> 01:40:47,067
What are you saying?
l am not that bad.

1506
01:40:48,099 --> 01:40:49,767
Goli, my phone!

1507
01:40:49,833 --> 01:40:51,434
What?
- Are you an actress?

1508
01:40:52,165 --> 01:40:53,966
That rickshaw driver has my phone.

1509
01:40:54,065 --> 01:40:56,534
You could be, if you tried,
l promise.

1510
01:40:57,499 --> 01:40:58,867
Look behind you.

1511
01:41:02,032 --> 01:41:03,233
Hey!

1512
01:41:03,799 --> 01:41:05,167
Get a hold of him!

1513
01:41:07,733 --> 01:41:09,034
