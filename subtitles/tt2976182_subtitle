1
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,222
I felt like right
out of some comic book.

2
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,062
He was wearing a mask..

3
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,623
...and only his eyes were visible.

4
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:14,637
I never saw so
many..terrified people before!

5
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,941
I was just 7..and was
visiting the bank with my dad.

6
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,612
I didn't let go of my dad's hand..

7
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,411
...nor did his eyes
stop haunting mine.

8
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,612
After that,
every time I visited the bank..

9
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:32,555
...I hoped to see him again.

10
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,485
But he didn't come.

11
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,956
But people had already
made up stories about him.

12
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,430
...according to their
own convenience.

13
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:42,394
Like..

14
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,298
Like some said he was caught.

15
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,436
Or..he became one of the
greatest thieves in the world.

16
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:51,071
There's a theory that suggests
he suddenly disappeared.

17
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:58,176
And he's been living in some
unknown country under an alias.

18
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:02,076
Your earlier films,
'Guns-Part 1' & 'Guns-Part 2'..

19
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,151
...was the story of a thief.

20
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,185
Tell me.

21
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,654
Will he be caught in 'Guns-Pan 3'?

22
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,027
That's an intelligent question.

23
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,564
For that you need to watch the film.

24
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,324
So what next?

25
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,564
Guns-Pan 4..5..6..7..

26
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,501
I don't know.

27
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,536
You seem quite
attached to that thief.

28
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,440
I've heard so many
stories about him.

29
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,171
"But there are some yet to be told.

30
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:32,048
Tell me..they say you're
quite the ladies-man.

31
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,184
I see..

32
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,449
Who are "They".

33
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,647
According to the local-media.

34
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,349
...you recently had
your 21st break-up.

35
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:45,390
History stands witness,
every artist has a process, sir.

36
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,829
Don't you think..this is too much.

37
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,399
"Less..more..right..wrong."

38
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,271
I never keep track.

39
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,147
Yes, Meera?

40
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:07,479
Mr. lrani called.

41
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,316
Who?

42
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,616
Navrose lrani, from Freeway Picture.

43
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,718
Oh..him! What's he saying?

44
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,058
He's in.

45
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,854
He didn't even try to negotiate.

46
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:20,330
He's willing to sign
the deal at your price.

47
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:21,655
That's good.

48
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,792
He's sent the agreement
to our lawyers.

49
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,296
Just one problem.

50
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,101
He wants to read the script.

51
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,766
Now that's a dedicated financer.

52
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,437
Wants to read the script.

53
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:32,701
And what did you say?

54
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,208
I told him the truth, obviously.

55
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,110
Lying is your job, remember.

56
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,411
Come on, Meera. What did you say?

57
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,575
Don't worry.

58
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,676
I didn't tell him
that there's no script.

59
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,312
I just said you didn't
show the script to anyone yet.

60
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,686
Did you send those
DVD's London to my dad?

61
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,623
In the afternoon. - Good.

62
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,610
Tonight's the night.

63
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:28,792
Bono.

64
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,396
Go and sleep.

65
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:10,738
Hi, dad.

66
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,679
You want to have
an affair at this age?

67
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,247
Not an affair.

68
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,874
I want some fun in my boring life.

69
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,442
You already had six hean attacks.

70
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:23,816
...due to your so called "Fun".

71
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,256
I am still alive.

72
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:28,725
Exactly.

73
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,991
You need a nurse, not a girlfriend.

74
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,193
I know, I know.

75
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,664
That reminds me,
Lisa called to say..

76
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,426
...that she is quitting from today.

77
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,636
Lisa is my nurse. - I know.

78
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:43,802
Jeez..

79
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:46,966
What did you do this time?

80
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,235
Nothing.

81
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,678
I just asked for her bra size.

82
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,876
Now that's not. - Dad.

83
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,850
That's the third nurse
that quit this month.

84
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,820
I am joking.

85
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,586
I need..

86
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,992
...an inspiration

87
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,789
Who's that?

88
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:09,824
Idiot, it means.. Inspiration.

89
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,566
Oh..that.

90
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:12,602
Shall I give you?

91
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:14,694
Goodnight, dad. - Bye.

92
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,335
Inspiration!

93
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,287
Hi..

94
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,363
Hi Kabir.

95
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,371
Bye.. - See you.

96
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:58,841
Inspiration!

97
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,755
From costumes to
DP..everyone's been calling.

98
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,252
Even/thing's getting delayed.

99
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,487
What do I tell them?

100
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:11,560
Where's the script?

101
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:15,324
Meera..what do you think is a film?

102
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,861
A film..is a dream.

103
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,463
A dream..where we write stories.

104
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:25,275
We portray characters.

105
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,168
We give them dialogues..

106
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:32,649
...and then an actor brings those
characters and dialogues to life.

107
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:37,245
But..what was that film?

108
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,621
It was a dream.

109
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,517
And where's the dream?

110
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,828
Here..in my mind.

111
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,660
It's ready..or getting ready.

112
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,630
I just..need to write it down.

113
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,974
I know you've seen this face before.

114
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,978
But take a good look at it again.

115
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,252
Our first encounter
with this thief.

116
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,757
...was 2= years ago.

117
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,627
In Louvre Museum, Paris

118
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:26,727
Exactly a year later..in
the Royal Palace of Qatar.

119
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:32,367
Seven months later..
Petronas Towers, Malaysia.

120
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,804
Then lndia..China!

121
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:42,880
Even after 2= years and
millions of dollars of theft.

122
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,752
...we still don't know who he is.

123
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,423
We're only following a mask.

124
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,885
Without any clear information.

125
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,632
And whoever he is, he's dangerous.

126
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:00,533
And right now..he's
doing a better job than us.

127
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,832
He's many steps ahead.

128
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,775
Gradually..he's being assumed.

129
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,284
...as one of the greatest
thieves in the world.

130
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,420
And we..

131
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:22,817
We're the protectors of the
Law..who failed to do their duty.

132
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:38,399
Hello.

133
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:39,999
Hey, Piya.

134
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,505
No..dinner won't be possible.

135
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,582
I still need to work on the script.

136
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:55,753
Maybe tomorrow"

137
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:57,790
Yeah.

138
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,456
You have a good one.

139
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,468
What? Greedy dog.

140
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,800
As you can see I
am standing outside.

141
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,600
...Malaysia's oldest an museum.

142
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:12,231
"Which is now the site of the biggest
art robbery in the entire world.

143
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,809
The thief walked into
the gates of the museum.

144
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:18,280
...and stole three paintings and
walked out in the dead of the night.

145
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,783
Three paintings worth over
100 million dollars were stolen.

146
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,978
The Malaysian police
were informed in the morning..

147
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,852
"But still they have no clues.

148
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,515
We'll be following the story,
as and when it develops.

149
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:13,424
This is the last painting
from a famous French Painter.

150
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,235
Bought from an an
gallery in London, in 1967.

151
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:22,499
For..25,000 Pounds.

152
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,903
Last week an an collector
paid me a visit.

153
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:33,448
...and told me some incredible
facts about this painting.

154
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:37,888
He said this painting is incomplete.

155
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:42,557
And someone else has the other side.

156
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:48,955
That art collector wants
that painting..the complete one.

157
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,901
And he's ready to pay
a handsome price for it.

158
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:54,767
How much?

159
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:00,068
120 million dollars. - For both?

160
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,805
For one.

161
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,089
Why doesn't he talk
to the owner directly?

162
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,733
He tried"

163
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,396
"but he doesn't want to sell.

164
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,398
Roy.

165
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,071
It's been a decade since
someone called me that.

166
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,313
Roy?

167
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,943
But that's your name, right?

168
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:43,978
Yes, but no one knows.

169
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,959
We humans always want
to live someone else's life.

170
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,792
That's our nature.

171
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,361
And..l am a thief after all.

172
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,127
Even my own life..isn't
completely mine.

173
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:05,903
Strange, isn't it?

174
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,702
Feeling estranged from oneself?

175
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,543
You sound too intellectual, Roy.

176
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,854
Where's the other
half of this painting?

177
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,554
Welcome to Malaysia's
'lndo-Malay' Radio channel.

178
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,562
The big news of the morning..

179
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,258
...is that Kabir Grewal..

180
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,666
...have arrived in Malaysia
to shoot Guns-Pan 3.

181
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:09,228
Ayesha Amir, London's film-maker..

182
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:13,538
...has been shooting her
film here for the past 10 days.

183
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,530
Cut it! Cut it!

184
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:41,498
What the hell is this?

185
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:43,269
What is all this?

186
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,398
It's rain, sir.

187
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,575
This isn't going to stop.

188
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,415
You think this will stop today.

189
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,446
I mean..why didn't you
tell me about the weather report?

190
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,344
What do you want me to do?

191
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,254
According to the weather report.

192
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,791
"The skies were
supposed to be clear.

193
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,315
Yeah..right!

194
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,888
I don't know why we came here.

195
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,263
Come on, Kabir.

196
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,930
Remember Guns-1 in Afghanistan.

197
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,595
You wanted to leave the first day.

198
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,329
That was different,
and this is different.

199
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,242
You know what.

200
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,640
Why don't you come over
to our hotel for dinner tonight?

201
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,615
Meera, this is your third
film with me, isn't it?

202
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:28,713
Yes.

203
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,515
You know I don't meet my
actors outside the character.

204
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,520
If they can respect that,
then why can't you?

205
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,558
I am done. Pack this up.

206
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:34,974
Excuse me.

207
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,377
Can you get me a Mikalin
with three cubes, please?

208
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:38,819
Three cubes! - Sure, sir.

209
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:04,372
Oh, thank you.

210
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,816
Three cubes. Perfect.

211
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:12,312
Excuse me,
can you get me one more please?

212
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:16,550
And one of whatever
that lady there is having.

213
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:17,918
Thank you.

214
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,936
Must be a really interesting book.

215
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,816
You never looked up for a moment.

216
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,049
I've been standing
in this bar for an hour.

217
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,785
This is such a happening place.

218
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,756
...and the only thing happening
here.. is watching you read.

219
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,885
Honestly speaking.
I can't drink alone.

220
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,523
I feel like I'm an alcoholic.

221
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,460
So..please, if you don't mind.

222
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,636
I don't mind drinking alone.

223
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,429
That's great, thank you.

224
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,374
I love a glass of wine with my book.

225
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,417
Being alone isn't bad.

226
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:21,852
You find life somewhere
entangled in the silence.

227
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,893
So that's the secret.

228
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,758
...behind Kabir Grewal's loud,
extravagant films.

229
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,326
I was going to introduce myself.

230
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:35,831
But how did you know?

231
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,633
The newspapers are always
flooded with your news.

232
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,438
Local press is tired
of waiting for you.

233
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,076
I really liked meeting
you too..Ayesha.

234
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,079
It wasn't easy
finding out about you.

235
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,783
But sometimes} do some hard work.

236
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,655
We're all not famous
and lucky like you.

237
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,721
Oh come on.

238
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,528
Don't give fate undue credit
for my hard work, please.

239
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,769
Actually..according to
whatever I heard about you..

240
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,773
...I shouldn't let you sit here.

241
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,567
I see..what did you hear?

242
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,714
You're arrogant..rude..etc...!

243
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,446
So which was the worst pan?

244
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:25,118
And do you believe
everything you hear?

245
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,789
No. - That's good.

246
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:30,650
But I was wondering are you really
what the people think you are?

247
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,621
Or you try to be what
the people say about you.

248
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,363
I've to get up early tomorrow.

249
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,101
Thanks for the wine.

250
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,364
Good evening Ms.
Ayesha Amir. - Good evening.

251
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:10,298
Mr. Kabir Grewal has
sent this book for you.

252
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,161
Have a pleasant evening.

253
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:23,837
Yeah..Kabir.

254
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,746
I need a girl in this film..who
will stay in that mansion.

255
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,909
What mansion? What girl?

256
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,915
She will have the painting
which Roy wants to steal.

257
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,554
Kabir..l don't understand.

258
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:38,183
I haven't read the script yet.

259
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,355
I haven't seen it either
but you will understand.

260
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,729
And by the way, I had
a word with the casting agency.

261
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,629
She is the perfect cast.

262
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,933
Arrange for her tickets, okay.

263
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,197
You know what..this
film is completely on you.

264
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:51,797
If anything goes wrong..it's on you.

265
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:52,864
Yeah..

266
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:30,712

Now the next work is by young,

the name of Edward Ramon.

of stir in the an world..

Gentlemen in the back..no.46.
Thank you very much.

296
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,530
Our next piece, ladies and
gentlemen is a very fine piece.

297
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:02,928
Okay, cut it.

298
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,367
Doesn't she look
a bit like Ayesha Amir?

299
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,300
Who?

300
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,477
That was rude!

301
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,817
You know I didn't write that book.

302
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:18,785
Still..that was rude.

303
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,524
What?

304
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:29,961
Now I get it?

305
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:35,002
You do relate to some
of the things in that book.

306
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,706
And it's raised a few questions
to which you don't have answers.

307
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:44,745
Now you're furious at me,
because I sent you that book.

308
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:45,746
Right?

309
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:48,773
Yeah..

310
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,688
What do you want to say?

311
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,617
What do you want to hear?

312
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:01,830
Actually.
I have an early shoot tomorrow.

313
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:05,667
Got to go. Goodnight.

314
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:28,388
Cut it.

315
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,681
Cut!

316
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,627
Looks good, huh! - Very good.

317
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:35,687
Nice work.

318
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,567
Shall we move on? - Yes.

319
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:44,999
Prepare for the next shot,
I'll join you.

320
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:45,866
0K8'!-

321
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,982
Ayesha..hi.

322
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,488
I was just shooting close-by,
and saw you pass-by.

323
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,386
How's your shooting coming along?

324
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:09,888
It's alright.

325
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:11,995
Don't you have a shoot?

326
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:13,931
I was working on the script.

327
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:16,503
Aah.. Me too.

328
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:18,639
Never-ending process.

329
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,005
Kabir GrewaFs films
have a script too?

330
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,945
Of course not.
I don't have a script.

331
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,548
People just come to watch my film.

332
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,480
And my film makes millions.

333
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,484
I am not like one of
those film-makers who..

334
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,015
...hugs trees, does..Yoga!

335
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:36,589
Makes films for himself..and
watches others films.

336
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,956
Are you one of them?
Those types really scare me.

337
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,862
Okay, that was bad. I am sorry.

338
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:49,337
I know you don't like
my sense of humor at all.

339
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:53,274
Definitely not my wine.
And neither my book.

340
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,409
But the coffee here is really nice.

341
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:01,279
0K8'!-

342
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,510
Yeah? Come on..

343
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:05,980
Don't you believe that.

344
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,820
...sometimes the location
gives the film-maker his story?

345
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,088
You know, just like lndia..

346
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:13,887
"The British ruled
Malaysia for many years.

347
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:19,699
They got their independence
10 years after us.

348
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,461
In 1957.

349
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:27,042
But if you look into
the eyes of any local..

350
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,408
You can see that
the battle is over..

351
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:32,979
...but the destruction
is still following him.

352
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:37,515
If you see closely,
you will also see hope.

353
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:38,985
I see..

354
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,086
Is that why you came here?

355
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:45,585
Actually I was heading somewhere
else but, ended up here.

356
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,130
Maybe this is just a coincidence,
or something else.

357
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:54,431
But this place is perfect. - it is.

358
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,938
There couldn't be a
better place for my film.

359
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:57,871
That's good.

360
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,604
Do you believe in coincidences?

361
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,441
Are you one of those people,
who believes.

362
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:11,749
...that there is a reason
for every small event in our life.

363
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:14,455
Coincidence.

364
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,825
Coincidence is nothing.

365
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,619
There is a reason for everything.

366
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,080
Madam, package for you.

367
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,583
Put it in the car.

368
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,391
So first you outbid
me on a painting.

369
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,125
And then you gift it to me.

370
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:29,825
You could've let me buy it.

371
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:31,933
Then I wouldn't have met you.

372
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:36,428
There are other ways to meet.

373
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,869
Yes..but this is my way.

374
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,806
I don't know whether
it's right or wrong.

375
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:46,010
But at least we met.

376
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,116
Aren't you a bit crazy?

377
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:54,056
People have called me crazy before.
This isn't the first time.

378
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,526
You have an answer
to all the questions.

379
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,497
Right now..only your questions.

380
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:04,865
I can't take this.

381
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,632
Why?

382
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:12,830
I don't even know your name.

383
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,839
Sometimes..it's not necessary.

384
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:24,216
So I am flattered, truly I am.

385
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,519
Give it some time"

386
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,954
You might change your mind.

387
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,508
Hi.

388
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:26,274
Can you tell me which
room is Kabir Grewal in?

389
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,782
Sure, let me check for you.

390
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:31,318
Mr. Grewal is actually
in our royal villa.

391
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,583
Just give me a moment,
I'll get a buggy for you. - Sure.

392
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:07,579
Buggy!

393
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:11,825
Buggy!

394
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:17,922
Hello.

395
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,336
Need a ride?

396
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:24,573
What do you think?

397
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,942
I've been waiting for
a buggy for over an hour.

398
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,403
And you're taking
a tour of this jungle.

399
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:32,574
What happened?

400
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:33,477
Break-up.

401
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,082
Too much to drink.

402
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,118
I don't know.

403
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,914
Maybe she's dead.

404
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:40,915
That's not funny.

405
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:53,166
Good news. She's still alive.

406
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:54,769
Shall we?

407
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,400
Idiot.

408
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,374
You know I was thinking.

409
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,068
...you were telling
me about that coincident.

410
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,379
I was thinking let's discuss
is it over dinner tomorrow at 8.

411
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:07,071
You are unbelievable.

412
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,049
You are just like
how people describe you.

413
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,144
Rude, Obnoxious, Arrogant.

414
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:17,151
You know how it is with these boys.

415
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:18,519
You like that.

416
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:31,697
You still didn't tell
me what you're doing here?

417
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,441
I did.

418
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,735
I am a tourist.

419
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:43,410
I've seen many tourists.

420
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,619
You're not one.

421
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,602
There are some things here..

422
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:13,511
"Which I buy cheap
and sell for a higher price.

423
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,316
When you say that it sounds
like you're here to rob us.

424
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:22,551
It is stealing from
one point of view.

425
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:28,728
We're all thieves.

426
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,205
You're very strange.

427
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:41,937
You know that.

428
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,572
Tell me something
more about yourself.

429
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,575
Something unique.

430
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:56,483
I want to disappear.

431
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,554
Meaning?

432
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,395
Someday I'll leave
all this and go far away.

433
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:07,263
To some unknown city
of an unknown country.

434
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,667
And star-t a new life under an alias.

435
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:16,039
Don't forget to ask
me before you leave.

436
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,442
Will you come?

437
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,477
You won't ask.

438
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,297
What are you doing here alone?

439
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,332
Just thinking.

440
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,306
Ayesha Amir.

441
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:52,741
Huh?

442
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,480
No.

443
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,917
She's an amazing girl,
but not your type.

444
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,516
Really? I see.

445
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,685
You have a type, Kabir.

446
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:06,387
Actually, it's quite simple.

447
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:08,623
Pick up any fashion magazine..

448
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:11,290
...and you will find
your type of girl.

449
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,365
But Ayesha is different.

450
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:18,598
She doesn't fit in your
films..nor in your life.

451
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:21,736
Thank you.

452
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,343
Don't you think you're
being too dramatic?

453
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:28,641
Yeah..okay.

454
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,316
Yeah..Maybe!

455
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:03,174
Cut!

456
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,822
Oh..champagne..nice.

457
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:12,725
Does Rohan know about this?

458
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,198
Oh my, God!

459
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:27,372
Kabir Grewal! Right?

460
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:36,682
I am going to call him.

461
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:45,182
Kabir.

462
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:48,392
I just want to have dinner with you.
Not marry you.

463
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,857
Thanks for the champagne.

464
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:51,291
You are most welcome.

465
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,563
Then meet in lobby at 8 o'clock

466
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,072
What?

467
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,642
Nothing.

468
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:10,576
"Get me those golden earrings."

469
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,689
"SweetheamPll
dangle them on my ears."

470
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:19,192
"Get me those golden earrings."

471
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,094
"SweetheamPll
dangle them on my ears."

472
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:34,139
"Get me those golden earrings."

473
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:38,339
"SweetheamPll
dangle them on my ears."

474
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,678
"Get me those golden earrings."

475
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,845
"SweetheamPll
dangle them on my ears."

476
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,282
"Get me those golden earrings."

477
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:49,585
"SweetheamPll
dangle them on my ears."

478
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:54,285
"Say yes..and take me shopping."

479
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:58,762
"Say yes..and take
me to a romantic film."

480
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:01,167
"I have sent requests."

481
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,132
"My fair arms.."

482
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:05,333
"O Baby..my fair arms."

483
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,573
"My fair arms.."

484
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:10,201
"O Baby..my white arms."

485
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,272
"My fair arms.."

486
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:14,782
"O Baby..they are for you."

487
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,741
"My fair arms.."

488
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:19,583
"O Baby..my fair arms."

489
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,748
Geoffrey.. It's Kabir.

490
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,959
Yeah, from last night. How are you?

491
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:28,361
Okay, I need a table for
two tonight. 8 o'clock. Okay.

492
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:31,559
The best champagne.
No, no, no..not the same..

493
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:35,266
Hey“

494
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,168
What are you doing here?

495
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,971
I missed my flight.
- You missed your flight?

496
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,404
Wonderful.

497
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:47,412
"I feel overwhelmed."

498
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:51,419
"And I am soaring in the sky.."

499
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:53,580
"And I am soaring
in the sky all night."

500
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:56,486
"My life's completely changed."

501
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,788
"..and I've lost my slumber."

502
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,658
"And I am soaring in the sky.."

503
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,994
"And I am soaring
in the sky all night."

504
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:07,897
"Say yes..and buy me a pink veil."

505
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:12,566
"Say yes..and buy
me colorful bangles."

506
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,801
"I have sent requests."

507
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:16,844
"My fair arms.."

508
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:19,347
"O Baby..my fair arms."

509
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,508
"My fair arms.."

510
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:24,018
"O Baby..my white arms."

511
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:26,019
"My fair arms.."

512
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,746
"O Baby..they are for you."

513
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:30,657
"My fair arms.."

514
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,990
"O Baby..my fair arms."

515
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,504
Good evening, MsAmir.
I am the hotel manager.

516
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,507
Your car's waiting for you.

517
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:46,668
My Car?

518
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,674
Your car.

519
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:48,772
Where's Kabir?

520
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:52,113
Mr. Grewal is at the venue,
but he's sent a car for you.

521
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:53,646
Shall we?

522
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,494
Hey..there you are.

523
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:08,690
Hello. - Hi.

524
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:14,735
You look great. - Thanks.

525
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:15,634
Shall we?

526
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:18,469
I was so confused. Why two cars?

527
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,501
Oh..that.

528
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,706
Just you know..safety.

529
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:32,611
If you want to go..or we..or her?

530
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:34,823
Who?

531
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:38,521
Pia's inside.

532
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,561
Pia?

533
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,262
Last night's casualty.

534
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:48,201
Can you believe it,
she missed her flight?

535
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,566
I mean unbelievable.

536
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:51,599
No.22..

537
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:53,037
Yeah whatever.

538
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:55,641
But you know what, Ayesha.

539
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,610
I totally understand if
you don't want to go inside.

540
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:01,740
It's not your fault or mine.

541
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:04,647
It's completely her fault,
and she should pay for it.

542
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:05,651
Right?

543
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,288
So..if you're feeling
uncomfortable at all.

544
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:15,191
And I think..you are
feeling a bit uncomfortable.

545
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:19,095
So all you got to do,
is go inside and tell her that.

546
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:21,635
We're going someplace else,
that's it.

547
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:25,173
And the other car can drop her home.

548
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:27,241
What do you think?

549
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:28,701
Me?

550
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:29,674
Yeah.

551
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,370
What do I think?

552
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:39,084
Just tell me..are we
going in or someplace else?

553
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:40,118
That's it.

554
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,794
Okay..let's go someplace else.

555
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,253
Okay, cool.

556
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:53,691
So I should tell her.

557
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,167
Yeah.

558
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,196
0K8'!-

559
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:02,371
Give me a minute.

560
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:16,188
Idiot!

561
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:27,928
Yes?

562
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:31,258
Send him in.

563
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:42,967
Did you make these?

564
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:45,179
Huh!

565
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:51,146
They say a good picture is one
that can narrate an entire story.

566
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:55,188
And a good story can
be captured in a picture.

567
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:00,626
After looking at these,
I feel like I don't know you at all.

568
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:03,620
Stop, you're embarrassing me.

569
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:13,071
I'll change and come.

570
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:48,627
I can't say where he
is or what he is going to do.

571
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,466
But owing to years
of investigation.

572
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:57,305
...and the evidence that
we gathered in the past 10 days.

573
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:04,210
...I can see that
we're very close to him.

574
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,611
Have you ever heard
cops and robber stories?

575
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:09,624
No matter what the thief does.

576
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:12,750
"But he always gets
caught in the end.

577
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:18,757
This story is about to end now.

578
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:34,145
Hello. - Detective Wadia.

579
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:36,112
Speaking.

580
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,274
Nice interview.

581
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:38,585
And you are?

582
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,688
But you made a mistake.

583
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:47,420
You've been chasing
me for 3 = years..

584
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:53,894
...and you haven't even
read the first chapter yet.

585
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:57,899
This story will end, detective.

586
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:00,135
It definitely will.

587
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:05,809
But not the way..you
claimed it will.

588
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:13,853
Okay, cut it. That's good.

589
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,491
Guys, give me a nice big wide-shot.

590
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:21,628
Kabir..we've been working
overtime for three days.

591
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:23,364
The crew's tired.

592
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:24,793
How about we take a break tomorrow?

593
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:28,327
0K8'!-

594
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:29,662
Thanks.

595
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:31,598
I hate night shoots.

596
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:11,704
Wow! Good morning.

597
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:15,178
You're up early?

598
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:19,547
Yeah.. I was about to hit the
bed when I got a little distracted.

599
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:25,124
80..

600
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:26,620
Yoga..huh?

601
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:30,523
Yeah.. Yoga.

602
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:32,661
You should try it sometime.

603
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:34,294
Me?

604
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:35,832
I am fine.

605
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:38,672
Hello. I am not sick either.

606
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:40,564
Yeah..

607
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:44,236
Sorry for not calling
you after that day.

608
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:46,906
I thought. - Oh..forget about it.

609
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:50,184
Disaster. .huh?

610
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:55,746
If I could, I would've
reshot that entire scene again.

611
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,116
No time for that.

612
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:01,388
I'm leaving in three days.

613
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:02,459
What?

614
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:04,830
You're done.

615
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:07,534
Yeah..

616
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:10,870
WOW!

617
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,463
Three days, huh!

618
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:16,666
Make it four.

619
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:19,806
Why?

620
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:36,288
There's an island close-by.

621
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:38,725
Just two hours away.

622
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,897
If we leave in the morning
we'll be back by evening.

623
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,334
0K8'!-

624
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:06,986
No..no..

625
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:11,957
You live alone in this
huge estate all by yourself.

626
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,028
Aren't you scared?

627
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:20,133
Not scared. I do feel lonely.

628
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,536
But not scared.

629
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,110
Don't you feel lonely?

630
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:32,618
<i>I do..</i>

631
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:36,482
But I am used to living alone now.

632
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:39,583
Me too.

633
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:44,998
You're strange.

634
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:48,696
Just like you.

635
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,033
You were saying something. - What?

636
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:54,769
About some island.

637
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:56,470
Yes.

638
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:13,384
"Selfish. ."

639
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,294
"Be a little selfish."

640
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:20,362
"Stop listening to the world."

641
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:25,131
"Listen only to yourself."

642
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:27,602
"Selfish. ."

643
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:31,335
"Be a little selfish."

644
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:34,881
"Stop listening to the world."

645
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:39,416
"Listen only to yourself."

646
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:43,216
"if something goes wrong.."

647
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,827
"Even if the head's
lost for a while."

648
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:50,387
"Let those careless heartbeats."

649
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:54,558
"..make a sound loud
enough for everyone to hear."

650
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,365
"The sun has just set."

651
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:58,268
"Take a sip of fun."

652
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:01,741
"And forget your way back home."

653
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,471
"The sun has just set."

654
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:05,375
"Take a sip of fun."

655
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:08,882
"Forget all the grief in the world."

656
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:10,679
"Ask me for anything."

657
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:12,549
"I can give you anything."

658
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:15,885
"..forget your way back home."

659
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:17,781
"Ask me for anything."

660
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:19,849
"I can give you anything."

661
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:23,328
"..forget all the
grief in the world."

662
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:47,317
"Let's not care about anyone."

663
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:54,453
"That's what this moment
is teaching us now."

664
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:59,293
"Let's not care about anyone."

665
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,826
"That's what this moment
is teaching us now."

666
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:06,601
"With this selfish desire.."

667
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:09,701
"..let's live freely."

668
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:13,646
"It's a romantic ambiance."

669
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,611
"The sun has just set."

670
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,446
"Take a sip of fun."

671
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:20,920
"And forget your way back home."

672
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:22,684
"The sun has just set."

673
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:24,655
"Take a sip of fun."

674
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,854
"And forget all the
grief in the world."

675
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:48,516
"Let's soar in the skies right now."

676
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:56,087
"With no clue where to go."

677
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,521
"Let's soar in the skies right now."

678
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:03,996
"With no clue where to go."

679
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,829
"Because all the paths..lead
to the destination."

680
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:10,995
"Let's distance
ourselves..from the world."

681
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:15,008
"And some distance between us."

682
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:16,839
"The sun has just set."

683
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,811
"Take a sip of fun."

684
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:22,042
"And forget your way back home."

685
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:24,045
"The sun has just set."

686
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,916
"Take a sip of fun."

687
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:29,456
"And forget all the
grief in the world."

688
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,115
"Ask me for anything."

689
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,587
"I can give you anything."

690
00:57:36,686 --> 00:57:38,427
"Ask me for anything."

691
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:40,660
"I can give you anything."

692
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:53,070
Actually, you know something.

693
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:56,579
The one holding the
gun is always in control.

694
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:58,411
Because everyone listens to him.

695
00:57:58,775 --> 00:57:59,879
That's true.

696
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:03,654
That's not true. - It is.

697
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:09,020
Yeah..if you're speaking in
terms of hean then, I won't argue.

698
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,459
Why not?

699
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:14,825
Because the hean can't be trusted.

700
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,531
It slips anytime.

701
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:20,297
At least to shoot a bullet
one needs to pull the trigger.

702
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,646
I have a rule too. - Really?

703
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:27,748
If the story is heading
in the wrong direction.

704
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:29,544
"Then, you should
end it right there.

705
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:31,782
No point in taking it any further.

706
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:34,015
And what do you mean by that?

707
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:37,583
You know what I mean.

708
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:59,603
I wish I could take
this serenity along with me.

709
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:06,811
You can find this serenity
in any corner of the world.

710
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:11,624
Things we don't understand,
we don't hear.

711
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:15,423
And after you leave tomorrow"

712
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:18,523
"this place will be calmer
then it needs to be, Ayesha Amir.

713
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:22,098
I don't know why, but.

714
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:25,165
I will miss you.

715
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:35,582
I always wanted
to be a belly dancer.

716
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:36,978
I couldn't do that.

717
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,645
I would be afraid
to come on the stage.

718
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:50,620
Stay here.

719
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:08,663
Who are you?

720
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:12,866
Be honest.

721
01:02:13,996 --> 01:02:16,602
Because you never
give an honest answer.

722
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:20,504
I told you..

723
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:25,809
You like to keep that mystery
about yourself, don't you?

724
01:02:28,644 --> 01:02:30,851
I guess you're hiding yourself.

725
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,054
From who?

726
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:37,759
You will have to tell me that.

727
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:42,662
You're making me confess
before I commit the crime.

728
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:29,781
Thanks for today.

729
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:32,912
What I did?

730
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:55,786
I read your script.

731
01:06:57,947 --> 01:06:58,891
What?

732
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:03,786
Really?

733
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:08,368
WOW!

734
01:07:13,095 --> 01:07:14,403
How was it?

735
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:18,338
I only got to the part where
Roy steals the painting from Tia.

736
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:20,108
I only wrote it so far.

737
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:25,646
What about Tia now?

738
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:28,819
The story is about Roy, not Tia.

739
01:07:30,613 --> 01:07:32,786
What if Tia is in love with Roy?

740
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:36,992
That won't happen..

741
01:07:38,087 --> 01:07:39,828
"But if she does, it's okay.

742
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:41,525
She will have to get over him.

743
01:07:44,994 --> 01:07:46,337
And what about Roy?

744
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:48,931
Roy..

745
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:52,376
Roy is a thief in this story.

746
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:54,074
He's gone for now.

747
01:07:55,604 --> 01:07:57,914
Now he'll have a new job..new name.

748
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,394
Do you know what
they say about writers?

749
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:12,360
Read their story,
and you'll know how they are.

750
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:18,164
Are you judging me, Ayesha?

751
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,708
Don't do it..it's just a story.

752
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:27,108
Stories can never be wrong, Kabir.

753
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:46,556
Is this your car, sir? - Yeah.

754
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:47,690
Sorry, there's no parking here.

755
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:49,133
Just five minutes.
- I am sorry, sir.

756
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:50,033
You must park inside.

757
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:51,833
Just five minutes. - Sorry, sir.

758
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:55,106
I'll be right back.

759
01:10:59,558 --> 01:11:02,129
Director of Guns Pan-1&2,
Kabir Grewal..

760
01:11:02,194 --> 01:11:05,107
...who's often been in the
headlines regarding his love-life..

761
01:11:05,164 --> 01:11:07,041
Well, no surprise once again..

762
01:11:07,099 --> 01:11:11,104
His new love affair
has begun with his new film.

763
01:11:11,237 --> 01:11:14,480
No. 23 is Ayesha Amir,
who's from London..

764
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:15,712
...and she's a film-maker.

765
01:11:16,042 --> 01:11:17,248
And coincidentally,
she was staying.

766
01:11:17,309 --> 01:11:19,585
...in the same hotel as Kabir,
during her shoot.

767
01:11:19,645 --> 01:11:21,318
And that's where they met.

768
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,017
According to our sources,
everyday in Malaysia..

769
01:11:24,083 --> 01:11:26,324
"After the shooting,
Kabir Grewal and Ayesha Amir..

770
01:11:26,385 --> 01:11:28,422
...would spend time
together with each other..

771
01:11:28,487 --> 01:11:30,489
...and their affair
started from there.

772
01:11:30,556 --> 01:11:32,365
One more interesting thing is..

773
01:11:32,425 --> 01:11:34,666
...that after meeting Ayesha Amir,
Kabir Grewal..

774
01:11:34,727 --> 01:11:36,604
...in his film 'Guns-3'..

775
01:11:36,662 --> 01:11:40,508
...has cast an actress who
looks exactly like Ayesha Amir.

776
01:11:40,666 --> 01:11:43,408
And we will just return
after a short break.

777
01:11:43,469 --> 01:11:46,245
After the break we will
see some interesting news about.

778
01:11:46,305 --> 01:11:47,716
"The Cricket World Cup 2015.

779
01:11:47,773 --> 01:11:49,616
Till then stay with us.

780
01:11:56,615 --> 01:11:58,788
Nowadays the news about the affair
of Kabir Grewal and Ayesha Amir..

781
01:11:58,851 --> 01:12:00,524
...is everywhere.

782
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:03,494
Do you know that in his new film,
Kabir Grewal..

783
01:12:03,556 --> 01:12:06,560
...has cast an actress who
looks exactly like Ayesha Amir.

784
01:12:06,625 --> 01:12:10,402
His girlfriend is remembered
not by her name but by her number.

785
01:12:10,863 --> 01:12:12,774
In another high profile an heist.

786
01:12:12,832 --> 01:12:15,142
...it is now being reported
that an antique painting..

787
01:12:15,201 --> 01:12:16,703
...has been stolen in Malaysia.

788
01:12:16,769 --> 01:12:19,511
The prime suspect to
be the same masked thief..

789
01:12:19,572 --> 01:12:21,279
...who they have
unsuccessfully pursued..

790
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:23,149
...over the last
three and half years.

791
01:12:23,209 --> 01:12:25,086
The value of the reported
stolen painting..

792
01:12:25,144 --> 01:12:27,556
...from Malaysia is
over 100 million dollars.

793
01:12:27,646 --> 01:12:30,217
Detective Wadia,
the lead detective in charge.

794
01:12:30,282 --> 01:12:33,729
...is already on his way to
Malaysia to begin his investigation.

795
01:12:48,801 --> 01:12:51,907
Who was he? You know him?

796
01:12:52,872 --> 01:12:54,818
I don't even know his name.

797
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:59,920
How did he look? Description?

798
01:13:00,846 --> 01:13:03,656
I would've stopped
him if I had seen him.

799
01:13:12,825 --> 01:13:14,236
I don't know.

800
01:13:43,189 --> 01:13:45,829
Wadia and the Malaysian Police
are looking for you everywhere.

801
01:13:46,792 --> 01:13:49,329
Just stay where you are.

802
01:13:51,197 --> 01:13:53,905
As soon as the police
checking reduces..

803
01:13:54,433 --> 01:13:55,571
...I will come.

804
01:14:51,857 --> 01:14:52,995
Hello.

805
01:14:54,994 --> 01:14:56,496
No, I didn't read the article.

806
01:14:56,729 --> 01:14:59,266
And don't call my number again,
understand.

807
01:15:06,572 --> 01:15:08,916
Hey, Sam?
How much longer for the shot.

808
01:15:09,041 --> 01:15:10,281
Just 10 minutes, Kabir.

809
01:15:10,342 --> 01:15:12,481
You've been saying
that for the last one hour.

810
01:15:12,578 --> 01:15:13,989
We're shooting here,
not out on a picnic.

811
01:15:50,683 --> 01:15:53,061
Meera, we'll have to cancel
shoot today. I don't feel too well.

812
01:16:30,122 --> 01:16:32,568
Meera, since the last five
days there has been no shooting.

813
01:16:32,658 --> 01:16:34,001
This is not done.

814
01:16:34,059 --> 01:16:35,436
Where is Kabir?

815
01:17:03,922 --> 01:17:05,424
Pick up goddamit!

816
01:17:27,413 --> 01:17:28,721
So what did you do this time?

817
01:17:29,782 --> 01:17:30,852
Nothing.

818
01:17:31,917 --> 01:17:33,396
Then why did she leave?

819
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:37,458
She just left without saying a word.

820
01:17:37,723 --> 01:17:39,794
She just left. - Just like that.

821
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:42,971
Yes, just like that.

822
01:17:43,695 --> 01:17:45,606
Is this the new trend?

823
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:49,704
What trend?

824
01:17:53,705 --> 01:17:54,683
How are you?

825
01:17:55,441 --> 01:17:56,511
Are you fine?

826
01:17:57,142 --> 01:17:58,587
Yes, why?

827
01:17:58,744 --> 01:18:02,419
You're not upset, or yelling at me.

828
01:18:02,581 --> 01:18:04,527
You sound delusional.

829
01:18:05,017 --> 01:18:06,189
Are you okay?

830
01:18:06,585 --> 01:18:07,655
Dad, please.

831
01:18:08,053 --> 01:18:09,623
Why do you always judge me?

832
01:18:09,688 --> 01:18:12,225
I am not judging you,
I am just asking.

833
01:18:12,758 --> 01:18:15,432
And so what if I judge you,
you're my son.

834
01:18:17,496 --> 01:18:19,669
Kabir! Open the door!

835
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,479
Kabir! Open the door!

836
01:18:23,969 --> 01:18:24,845
Hello.

837
01:18:25,804 --> 01:18:27,613
Dad. I'll call you back.

838
01:18:29,241 --> 01:18:31,152
Kabir! I said open the door!

839
01:18:34,613 --> 01:18:36,889
Kabir, enough is enough!
Open the door!

840
01:18:37,449 --> 01:18:39,053
Everyone's waiting for you!

841
01:18:49,795 --> 01:18:53,709
I knew that after she left
there will be a strange tranquility.

842
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,575
But this was different.

843
01:18:58,537 --> 01:19:01,643
It grew with time"

844
01:19:03,075 --> 01:19:06,386
...and I was completely
sinking in it.

845
01:19:11,116 --> 01:19:14,563
Like I've been locked in some room.

846
01:19:16,155 --> 01:19:18,692
And it has no doors.

847
01:19:29,835 --> 01:19:31,815
When I came here,
I didn't have a story.

848
01:19:34,072 --> 01:19:36,052
When I found her, I found my story.

849
01:19:38,510 --> 01:19:41,582
Every moment I spent with her
star-ted weaving the pages of my story.

850
01:19:45,751 --> 01:19:47,526
She left suddenly.

851
01:19:48,987 --> 01:19:50,625
Didn't say anything, just left.

852
01:19:54,393 --> 01:19:55,667
My story came to a halt.

853
01:19:59,998 --> 01:20:01,773
I don't know what happens next.

854
01:20:19,851 --> 01:20:21,660
Roy's story is your story.

855
01:20:23,655 --> 01:20:25,532
Every question is your question.

856
01:20:26,058 --> 01:20:27,765
And you know the every answer.

857
01:20:29,895 --> 01:20:32,398
If you don't know
what happens next.

858
01:20:34,066 --> 01:20:35,010
"Then no one does.

859
01:21:00,592 --> 01:21:01,662
Good evening Mumbai.

01:21:01,727 --> 01:21:03,570
It is 10.40 at night.

861
01:21:03,629 --> 01:21:05,575

is 32 degrees Celsius.

To know the state of Mumbai traffic,
call on 462323.

We have just got the news.

...that Kabir Grewal had kept
his unit there for one month.

869

no shooting taking place.

During this time there was news
about his affair with Ayesha Amir.

871
01:21:29,154 --> 01:21:31,896
There is more spicy news
from the Entertainment world.

872

873

Look who's here..

Hi!

875
01:21:49,775 --> 01:21:52,881
How are you?

876
01:21:58,684 --> 01:22:01,130
You're not giving me
too many options, Mr. Grewal.

877
01:22:01,687 --> 01:22:03,394
We've already suffered a big loss.

878
01:22:03,655 --> 01:22:06,067
Do you know how much money
I've invested in your film?

879
01:22:11,029 --> 01:22:12,599
You're right, Mr. lrani.

880
01:22:15,767 --> 01:22:17,405
You have indeed suffered a loss..

881
01:22:18,603 --> 01:22:20,082
...and it is completely my fault.

882
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:24,020
Let's do one thing, you
can take your money back from me.

883
01:22:25,644 --> 01:22:27,749
Kabir? - Yeah.

884
01:22:29,481 --> 01:22:31,154
Do you know what you're saying?

885
01:22:31,817 --> 01:22:33,694
You'll be out on the streets, Kabir.

886
01:22:35,787 --> 01:22:36,822
I know.

887
01:22:38,657 --> 01:22:41,797
Fine..I'll talk to my lawyers.

888
01:23:14,893 --> 01:23:15,701
Hi, dad.

889
01:23:15,827 --> 01:23:17,636
Do you have any dinner plans?

890
01:23:18,563 --> 01:23:21,510
No. No plans for dinner.
- Fine, I am coming.

What are you doing?

895
01:23:30,008 --> 01:23:31,487
The doctors advised you against it.

896
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:33,380
I was celebrating.

897
01:23:34,546 --> 01:23:36,617
Celebrating? For what?

898
01:23:37,082 --> 01:23:39,460
You know what's been going
on in my life these days.

899
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:43,063
I know..

900
01:23:45,991 --> 01:23:47,937
What you're feeling right now..

901
01:23:49,561 --> 01:23:51,563
...and not letting you work..

902
01:23:53,165 --> 01:23:55,406
...is called a 'hean-break'.

903
01:23:57,803 --> 01:24:00,113
Actually,
it's called a 'Writer's block'.

904
01:24:01,173 --> 01:24:05,144
That thing you're saying,
doesn't happen with me.

905
01:24:06,111 --> 01:24:07,920
It happens with everyone.

906
01:24:09,514 --> 01:24:13,052
Okay..so now you're generalizing it.

907
01:24:13,385 --> 01:24:14,489
No, I'm not but.

908
01:24:18,156 --> 01:24:20,033
Remember, when you were just a kid.

909
01:24:20,625 --> 01:24:23,128
All you kids together
went for a treasure hunt.

910
01:24:24,696 --> 01:24:27,142
And the boy that
won the treasure hunt..

911
01:24:27,732 --> 01:24:29,643
"Got a toy-gun as a reward.

912
01:24:31,102 --> 01:24:33,139
You didn't talk
to anyone for a week.

913
01:24:33,705 --> 01:24:35,946
You were adamant that
you wanted that gun.

914
01:24:37,409 --> 01:24:38,854
You didn't admit it back then"

915
01:24:39,744 --> 01:24:45,023
...nor will you admit it now,
that you were heart-broken.

916
01:24:48,787 --> 01:24:52,132
I think that was
a kid's obstinacy, but.

917
01:24:53,592 --> 01:24:55,868
Not bad, dad..you remember.

918
01:24:57,429 --> 01:24:58,965
I am your father, my son.

919
01:25:00,198 --> 01:25:01,176
Cheer up.

920
01:25:01,867 --> 01:25:05,872
So this time..you're
really head-broken.

921
01:25:09,241 --> 01:25:11,050
So are we're celebrating that?

922
01:25:12,544 --> 01:25:14,490
Look, you didn't
complete your studies.

923
01:25:15,447 --> 01:25:16,983
Consider this as your graduation.

924
01:25:18,149 --> 01:25:22,154
And as they say all that
is not in need is a broken hean.

925
01:25:25,123 --> 01:25:26,830
Your graduation gift.

926
01:25:27,125 --> 01:25:28,729
Oh..gift.

927
01:25:31,730 --> 01:25:34,870
A watch..which I don't wear.

928
01:25:35,467 --> 01:25:36,468
Wear it..

929
01:25:37,035 --> 01:25:39,481
You'll know the value of time.

930
01:25:40,205 --> 01:25:43,084
It's really sweet of you,
dad, but really.. no thanks.

931
01:25:43,909 --> 01:25:47,220
Fine, I'll keep it.

932
01:25:50,482 --> 01:25:51,654
80..

933
01:25:53,184 --> 01:25:54,492
...how is she?

934
01:25:55,053 --> 01:25:55,997
Who?

935
01:25:56,721 --> 01:25:59,065
Come on,
you know who I am talking about.

936
01:26:03,528 --> 01:26:04,529
Ayesha.

937
01:26:06,131 --> 01:26:07,667
She's crazy, just like me.

938
01:26:09,534 --> 01:26:10,638
Unique.

939
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:28,392
That was probably the most
beautiful evening of my life.

940
01:26:31,022 --> 01:26:32,626
Everything was perfect.

941
01:26:38,663 --> 01:26:42,475
But everything changed with dawn.

942
01:26:46,471 --> 01:26:50,715
He was in front of me,
but I was alone.

943
01:27:01,586 --> 01:27:04,692
All I remember is
that I was scared of him.

944
01:27:15,133 --> 01:27:16,237
Hello.

945
01:27:16,868 --> 01:27:19,246
Mr. lrani, I am with Kabir.

946
01:27:20,038 --> 01:27:21,073
At Ahuja Towers.

947
01:27:21,973 --> 01:27:23,543
I'll be at the office in 30 minutes.

948
01:27:23,608 --> 01:27:24,882
Yeah..I'll see you.

949
01:27:24,943 --> 01:27:26,115
Okay, bye.

950
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:34,594
You didn't have to do this, Kabir.

951
01:27:36,554 --> 01:27:37,726
You're wrong.

952
01:27:38,590 --> 01:27:40,729
At least I won't have
to tolerate that lrani anymore.

953
01:27:44,529 --> 01:27:45,906
You know I am proud of you.

954
01:27:47,032 --> 01:27:48,010
Finally..

955
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,677
Finally..really?

956
01:27:51,236 --> 01:27:52,738
That's really sweet of you.

957
01:27:54,572 --> 01:27:56,643
I always thought..you
will never be able..

958
01:27:56,708 --> 01:28:00,781
...to stand up to the
real struggle in life.

959
01:28:02,013 --> 01:28:03,583
It's really good to know..

960
01:28:03,682 --> 01:28:05,889
...that you have such
high thoughts about me.

961
01:28:07,018 --> 01:28:08,224
That's done.

962
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:10,964
And better leave
before I star-t to cry.

963
01:28:11,256 --> 01:28:12,496
I have lots to do.

964
01:28:12,624 --> 01:28:13,568
Bye.

965
01:28:40,151 --> 01:28:41,721
I love it.

966
01:28:41,953 --> 01:28:43,728
Try to fix those together. - Okay.

967
01:28:43,855 --> 01:28:44,856
Very nice.

968
01:28:49,627 --> 01:28:50,867
Yes just skip.

969
01:29:04,743 --> 01:29:06,848
Didn't you see the
"Do Not Disturb" signboard?

970
01:29:07,112 --> 01:29:10,184
Open the door, Kabir. - Wait.

971
01:29:12,917 --> 01:29:16,694
Eastern Oriental International
Film Festival Jury.

972
01:29:17,021 --> 01:29:17,522
You want to go?

973
01:29:17,589 --> 01:29:19,466
They invite me every year,
but I never go.

974
01:29:19,958 --> 01:29:20,834
Why now?

975
01:29:21,593 --> 01:29:23,971
Have a look. Just have a look.

976
01:29:25,497 --> 01:29:27,568
Hey bono.

977
01:30:52,417 --> 01:30:55,557
Ladies and Gentlemen,
the next section is..

978
01:30:59,657 --> 01:31:01,967
The award for the best
foreign language film goes to..

979
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:04,140
Ayesha Amir, Malacca Diaries.

980
01:31:18,409 --> 01:31:19,513
WOW!

981
01:31:20,178 --> 01:31:21,589
Thank you.

982
01:31:22,046 --> 01:31:23,150
Congratulations.

983
01:31:24,482 --> 01:31:25,460
WOW!

984
01:31:28,786 --> 01:31:33,428
Someone once said to me that
sometimes a place gives you a story.

985
01:31:34,792 --> 01:31:37,170
Thank you, Malaysia for
being that beautiful place.

986
01:31:37,495 --> 01:31:40,738
That beautiful story,
that became my Malacca Diaries.

987
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:44,611
And you've made me the
happiest person alive today.

988
01:31:44,669 --> 01:31:47,240
And for that I'm forever grateful.
Thank you so much.

989
01:31:56,848 --> 01:31:59,556
Did you get this award because
your ex-boyfriend is on the jury?

990
01:31:59,684 --> 01:32:02,790
Do you think you won this
award because of Kabir Grewal?

991
01:32:14,799 --> 01:32:18,770
'There were all kinds
of faces and mask around me.'

992
01:32:19,771 --> 01:32:21,808
'Young, old, male, female.

993
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:23,915
And everyone was happy.

994
01:32:24,575 --> 01:32:26,714
I wonder what they were happy about.

995
01:32:27,745 --> 01:32:29,656
Or what grief were they hiding.

996
01:32:32,917 --> 01:32:35,523
Happiness is very
addictive like alcohol.

997
01:32:37,088 --> 01:32:38,999
I was feeling happy too..

998
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:44,303
...that maybe a new chapter
of my life was about to begin.

999
01:33:13,992 --> 01:33:15,027
Kabir.

1000
01:33:18,830 --> 01:33:19,808
Hi.

1001
01:33:22,533 --> 01:33:23,978
I thought you won't come.

1002
01:33:24,802 --> 01:33:26,076
Maybe that would've been right.

1003
01:33:28,373 --> 01:33:29,477
Ayesha.. - Wait.

1004
01:33:30,641 --> 01:33:32,848
I had many questions about you.

1005
01:33:33,745 --> 01:33:36,419
And not a single answer.

1006
01:33:38,049 --> 01:33:40,689
But when I thought about
those questions, I realized..

1007
01:33:40,752 --> 01:33:44,700
...that no matter what you
say..it's going to be wrong. .

1008
01:33:46,758 --> 01:33:49,932
I knew one Kabir Grewal..

1009
01:33:50,628 --> 01:33:54,576
...and there's another one,
whom I don't want to know.

1010
01:33:57,068 --> 01:33:58,138
Who are you?

1011
01:33:58,569 --> 01:33:59,912
Are you Kabir or Roy?

1012
01:34:01,072 --> 01:34:02,710
Do you know that?

1013
01:34:04,175 --> 01:34:06,621
You plundered my life
and made your story.

1014
01:34:07,045 --> 01:34:09,150
You stole it from me, just like Roy.

1015
01:34:11,549 --> 01:34:13,085
We're very different people, Kabir.

1016
01:34:13,551 --> 01:34:15,053
I wanted a simple story.

1017
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:16,057
But time made me realize..

1018
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:19,499
...that we were both living in two
different stories at the same time.

1019
01:34:20,224 --> 01:34:23,797
Let's forget..what
happened between us.

1020
01:34:24,595 --> 01:34:27,007
There's no point in taking
that story any further.

1021
01:34:34,772 --> 01:34:36,945
If you know everything, then..

1022
01:34:38,443 --> 01:34:39,615
...why did you come here?

1023
01:34:39,844 --> 01:34:42,916
To tell you to stay
away from my life.

1024
01:34:43,915 --> 01:34:45,724
There's no place for you in it.

1025
01:35:07,004 --> 01:35:12,886
"Are you a stranger..or a kin?"

1026
01:35:13,778 --> 01:35:19,922
"What do I say..or not say."

1027
01:35:20,618 --> 01:35:26,796
"Are you a stranger..or a kin?"

1028
01:35:27,525 --> 01:35:32,998
"What do I say..or not say."

1029
01:35:33,164 --> 01:35:39,774
"The gestures are silent..and
I am at loss of words."

1030
01:35:39,837 --> 01:35:46,618
"I feel lost,
and my arms are lonely."

1031
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:53,987
"Beloved.. O Beloved."

1032
01:35:54,051 --> 01:36:00,024
"You still dwell in this separation,
beloved."

1033
01:36:00,491 --> 01:36:07,568
"Beloved.. O Beloved."

1034
01:36:07,765 --> 01:36:13,772
"You still dwell in this separation,
beloved."

1035
01:36:28,486 --> 01:36:34,664
"Even though we're apartbut
you're still with me."

1036
01:36:35,159 --> 01:36:40,632
"Somethings definitely
attached to me."

1037
01:36:41,966 --> 01:36:48,474
"Even though I am shattered..
I still didn't break apart."

1038
01:36:48,773 --> 01:36:54,189
"You still exist
somewhere in my life."

1039
01:36:54,545 --> 01:37:01,190
"The gestures are silent..and
I am at loss of words."

1040
01:37:01,252 --> 01:37:08,101
"I feel lost,
and my arms are lonely."

1041
01:37:08,292 --> 01:37:15,301
"Beloved.. O Beloved."

1042
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:21,607
"You still dwell in this separation,
beloved."

1043
01:37:21,906 --> 01:37:28,721
"Beloved.. O Beloved."

1044
01:37:29,013 --> 01:37:35,123
"You still dwell in this separation,
beloved."

1045
01:37:53,004 --> 01:37:59,148
"Every moment..l feel the desire.."

1046
01:37:59,844 --> 01:38:05,522
"..which was never satiated."

1047
01:38:06,684 --> 01:38:13,192
"Life is still going on.."

1048
01:38:13,557 --> 01:38:19,064
"But this isn't life."

1049
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:25,877
"The gestures are silent..and
I am at loss of words."

1050
01:38:25,936 --> 01:38:32,854
"I feel lost,
and my arms are lonely."

1051
01:38:33,010 --> 01:38:39,484
"Beloved.. O Beloved."

1052
01:38:40,151 --> 01:38:45,897
"You still dwell in this separation,
beloved."

1053
01:38:46,490 --> 01:38:53,237
"Beloved.. O Beloved."

1054
01:38:53,764 --> 01:38:59,646
"You still dwell in this separation,
beloved."

1055
01:39:10,214 --> 01:39:11,522
You also come.

1056
01:39:12,083 --> 01:39:17,829
But be careful..
Roy Wadia is still here.

1057
01:39:44,181 --> 01:39:45,057
Hi.

1058
01:39:46,817 --> 01:39:47,625
Sit.

1059
01:40:04,835 --> 01:40:05,870
How are you?

1060
01:40:07,405 --> 01:40:08,509
0K8'!-

1061
01:40:15,579 --> 01:40:16,922
What's wrong, Roy?

1062
01:40:20,184 --> 01:40:21,492
Roy!

1063
01:40:22,853 --> 01:40:24,127
Where are you lost?

1064
01:40:36,233 --> 01:40:38,839
I never cared about what
the society deemed right or wrong.

1065
01:40:40,638 --> 01:40:41,616
Only listened to myself..

1066
01:40:41,672 --> 01:40:43,151
...and followed my own rule book.

1067
01:40:45,643 --> 01:40:48,954
I am a thief..and this is my job.

1068
01:40:51,081 --> 01:40:52,685
I star-ted working with you..

1069
01:40:52,750 --> 01:40:54,923
"Because,
I wanted to run away from my life.

1070
01:40:56,954 --> 01:40:58,797
I wanted to leave everything behind.

1071
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:03,861
I had many questions in my mind..

1072
01:41:03,928 --> 01:41:05,464
...and this seemed
to be the right answer.

1073
01:41:08,232 --> 01:41:09,973
And you gave me a new name,
new identity.

1074
01:41:10,034 --> 01:41:11,911
...and a chance to
get away from myself.

1075
01:41:28,285 --> 01:41:30,026
But in the past few days.

1076
01:41:30,988 --> 01:41:33,525
"After spending
some time with myself..

1077
01:41:33,691 --> 01:41:38,538
...in the middle of the sea, I was
haunted by the same questions again.

1078
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:45,137
And I realized that..questions
remain the same.

1079
01:41:48,506 --> 01:41:49,849
...only the answers change.

1080
01:42:18,335 --> 01:42:19,177
Hi, Doc.

1081
01:42:20,671 --> 01:42:21,615
What?

1082
01:42:22,573 --> 01:42:23,916
Yeah, I am coming.

1083
01:46:28,485 --> 01:46:29,259
Hi, Meera.

1084
01:46:31,188 --> 01:46:32,189
I'm okay.

1085
01:46:38,462 --> 01:46:39,805
I've said my goodbyes, Meera.

1086
01:46:42,666 --> 01:46:44,145
Now let's complete the movie.

1087
01:46:55,479 --> 01:46:57,857
Vikram, his name's Abra Rizvi.

1088
01:46:58,949 --> 01:46:59,723
And he's the same person..

1089
01:46:59,783 --> 01:47:02,263
...who's connected
to many painting thefts.

1090
01:47:03,754 --> 01:47:05,199
Whoever has done the robbery..

1091
01:47:05,255 --> 01:47:06,893
...he is the one who has bought it.

1092
01:47:07,491 --> 01:47:10,836
And I know..he's now in Malaysia.

1093
01:47:12,596 --> 01:47:13,267
0K8'!-

1094
01:47:13,697 --> 01:47:16,837
Take the Malaysia police'
help and find him.

1095
01:47:17,701 --> 01:47:21,547
If we find him,
we'll find our thief.

1096
01:47:22,072 --> 01:47:23,176
Got it?

1097
01:47:30,981 --> 01:47:31,891
3 pm?

1098
01:47:32,950 --> 01:47:34,293
That sounds good.

1099
01:47:36,186 --> 01:47:37,164
Yeah.

1100
01:47:38,121 --> 01:47:39,122
I'll be there.

1101
01:47:42,693 --> 01:47:45,139
That sounds perfect, Mr. Garcia.

1102
01:47:45,662 --> 01:47:46,800
I know the place.

1103
01:47:59,276 --> 01:48:00,380
You are here?

1104
01:48:06,683 --> 01:48:08,526
I want those paintings back.

1105
01:48:09,887 --> 01:48:11,025
What do you mean?

1106
01:48:11,521 --> 01:48:15,401
I'll pay you whatever that
art collector's paying you.

1107
01:48:20,330 --> 01:48:22,332
Come, sit. - No, I am fine.

1108
01:48:22,566 --> 01:48:23,374
Roy.

1109
01:48:24,568 --> 01:48:25,410
Sit.

1110
01:48:36,747 --> 01:48:38,693
You never speak without a reason.

1111
01:48:42,352 --> 01:48:47,995
So I won't ask why you
want those paintings back.

1112
01:48:51,028 --> 01:48:56,671
The fact is..that art
collector's already paid me.

1113
01:48:58,001 --> 01:49:00,481
I've been in this
business for 40 years.

1114
01:49:02,472 --> 01:49:05,612
If I've given my word,
I have to stick to it.

1115
01:49:11,114 --> 01:49:12,115
Listen.

1116
01:49:14,451 --> 01:49:18,058
My job is to deliver
those paintings.

1117
01:49:19,589 --> 01:49:21,865
After that you can do as you please.

1118
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:24,704
Right?

1119
01:50:49,346 --> 01:50:49,949
Hello.

1120
01:50:50,847 --> 01:50:51,985
Detective Wadia.

1121
01:50:57,387 --> 01:50:58,923
You've been missing for so long.

1122
01:51:00,424 --> 01:51:01,459
Where are you?

1123
01:51:01,758 --> 01:51:03,738
We're both in Malaysia, Detective.

1124
01:51:04,828 --> 01:51:06,466
This story is over.

1125
01:51:07,764 --> 01:51:10,938
Tomorrow I will disappear forever,
but before I leave..

1126
01:51:11,768 --> 01:51:13,577
I want to return something
that belongs to you.

1127
01:51:13,904 --> 01:51:14,848
Me?

1128
01:51:16,506 --> 01:51:17,576
What is that?

1129
01:51:20,877 --> 01:51:21,719
Hello.

1130
01:52:08,191 --> 01:52:09,636
Do you play chess?

1131
01:52:18,068 --> 01:52:19,945
I was wondering..

1132
01:52:22,739 --> 01:52:24,218
...what the next move should be.

1133
01:52:35,018 --> 01:52:36,964
I don't want to waste your time.

1134
01:52:37,621 --> 01:52:38,827
Shall we get to the point?

1135
01:53:00,911 --> 01:53:03,152
I never heard your name before?

1136
01:53:06,149 --> 01:53:07,856
Who I am is irrelevant.

1137
01:53:09,486 --> 01:53:11,022
You know what I want.

1138
01:53:14,958 --> 01:53:20,636
You know..l am not ready
to sell them at any cost.

1139
01:53:21,565 --> 01:53:24,546
So..why did you come here?

1140
01:53:33,510 --> 01:53:34,853
To tell you..

1141
01:53:36,146 --> 01:53:38,217
...if you don't change your mind..

1142
01:53:39,249 --> 01:53:42,230
"Then I'll have to steal
those paintings from you.

1143
01:55:36,599 --> 01:55:38,510
Seems like you're
looking for someone?

1144
01:55:44,541 --> 01:55:48,011
Two days ago..l lost someone here.

1145
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:51,224
Who?

1146
01:55:53,316 --> 01:55:54,954
He's just a thief.

1147
01:55:55,919 --> 01:55:57,262
Has he stolen from you?

1148
01:55:58,521 --> 01:56:00,899
No, this is my job.

1149
01:56:02,992 --> 01:56:04,699
He's a thief and I am the police.

1150
01:56:09,499 --> 01:56:11,274
I was this close to him.

1151
01:56:13,269 --> 01:56:14,839
But I couldn't see his face.

1152
01:56:53,476 --> 01:56:55,649
Finally 'Guns-Pan 3'.

1153
01:56:55,712 --> 01:56:58,852
What should be the audience's
expectations with this film?

1154
01:56:59,949 --> 01:57:02,156
The thief's story
ends with this story.

1155
01:57:02,886 --> 01:57:04,524
So is this the end of the trilogy?

1156
01:57:04,754 --> 01:57:06,756
If his story ends, then I guess so.

1157
01:57:06,956 --> 01:57:08,867
How was your shooting experience?

1158
01:57:10,026 --> 01:57:12,438
It was one of the most
memorable experience of my life.

1159
01:57:12,762 --> 01:57:15,106
And was Ayesha Amir
also responsible.

1160
01:57:15,398 --> 01:57:17,469
...for making it a
memorable experience.

1161
01:57:19,869 --> 01:57:20,847
Not at all.

1162
01:57:22,138 --> 01:57:24,948
Your personal life is not
making the headlines these days.

1163
01:57:25,108 --> 01:57:28,851
What's the secret behind
the new Kabir Grewal version 2.0?

1164
01:57:31,481 --> 01:57:33,392
Someone told me that.

1165
01:57:33,917 --> 01:57:37,865
...read the story,
and you'll know how they are.

1166
01:57:38,721 --> 01:57:40,394
Does that make sense to you.

1167
01:57:43,860 --> 01:57:47,774
People often say "Now I
will change my life completely."

1168
01:57:47,831 --> 01:57:49,435
But they never do it.

1169
01:57:49,866 --> 01:57:50,776
But my opportunity is here.

1170
01:57:50,834 --> 01:57:52,575
But..no matter how
much time changes.

1171
01:57:53,670 --> 01:57:56,014
...we still have to pay for our past.

1172
01:57:57,006 --> 01:57:58,952
Whether in this world, or the next.

1173
01:57:59,509 --> 01:58:00,852
"But we'll definitely meet again.

1174
01:58:01,845 --> 01:58:02,516
I know.

1175
01:58:02,612 --> 01:58:08,460
"Bring me closer to myself."

1176
01:58:08,585 --> 01:58:14,592
"I want to see..whether
you dwell in me or not."

1177
01:58:14,924 --> 01:58:20,931
"Ask my every breath."

1178
01:58:21,231 --> 01:58:27,204
"Whether you dwell
in the infinity or not?"

1179
01:58:31,474 --> 01:58:36,856
"Bring me closer to myself."

1180
01:58:37,447 --> 01:58:43,022
"I want to see..whether
you dwell in me or not."

1181
01:58:43,853 --> 01:58:49,826
"Ask my every breath."

1182
01:58:50,093 --> 01:58:55,907
"Whether you dwell
in the infinity or not?

1183
01:58:56,533 --> 01:59:02,711
"I am near you.. and near me."

1184
01:59:03,039 --> 01:59:07,784
"Are you there or no?"

1185
01:59:09,279 --> 01:59:15,093
"Are you there or no?"

1186
01:59:15,919 --> 01:59:20,698
"Are you there or no?"

1187
01:59:22,225 --> 01:59:28,107
"Are you there or no?"

1188
01:59:40,910 --> 01:59:47,418
"You're the path
my dreams tread on."

1189
01:59:47,483 --> 01:59:53,525
"You're the one that connects
my dreams with reality."

1190
01:59:53,823 --> 02:00:00,069
"You're a beautiful
moment in my lifetime."

1191
02:00:00,396 --> 02:00:06,677
"You're the moment that
never stays..of my future"

1192
02:00:06,769 --> 02:00:12,651
"I am near you.. and near me."

1193
02:00:13,376 --> 02:00:17,950
"Are you there or no?"

1194
02:00:19,682 --> 02:00:23,653
"Are you there or no?"

1195
02:00:25,955 --> 02:00:30,768
"Are you there or no?"

1196
02:00:32,495 --> 02:00:38,741
"Are you there or no?"

1197
02:00:51,547 --> 02:00:57,725
"You're the reason
for the smile on my lips."

1198
02:00:57,820 --> 02:01:03,998
"Without you my existence
has no meaning."

1199
02:01:04,394 --> 02:01:10,401
"Without your light..l
seem faded away."

1200
02:01:10,733 --> 02:01:16,877
"Fill me with life
so I can stay alive."

1201
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:22,983
"I am near you.. and near me."

1202
02:01:23,746 --> 02:01:28,456
"Are you there or no?"

1203
02:01:30,086 --> 02:01:35,001
"Are you there or no?"

1204
02:01:36,592 --> 02:01:41,405
"Are you there or no?"

1205
02:01:42,832 --> 02:01:48,646
"Are you there or no?"

1206
02:02:18,367 --> 02:02:19,471
WOW!

1207
02:02:21,104 --> 02:02:23,641
I don't know what amazes me more.

1208
02:02:24,006 --> 02:02:28,455
Seeing you ready before time,
or..watching you play the piano?

1209
02:02:31,547 --> 02:02:32,890
Actually, I always wanted
to learn to play it..

1210
02:02:32,982 --> 02:02:35,656
"But I could never spare the time.

1211
02:02:35,818 --> 02:02:38,355
Why? I have the number
of the piano teacher?

1212
02:02:38,488 --> 02:02:39,466
Do you want it?

1213
02:02:39,522 --> 02:02:40,660
Stop it.

1214
02:02:43,626 --> 02:02:44,934
You look happy.

1215
02:02:45,495 --> 02:02:46,997
You should be too.

1216
02:02:47,463 --> 02:02:48,373
Come on.

1217
02:02:48,731 --> 02:02:51,735
Today is your film's success party.

1218
02:02:52,135 --> 02:02:53,739
Finally..it's over.

1219
02:02:56,472 --> 02:02:57,974
I don't know, Meera.

1220
02:03:00,343 --> 02:03:01,788
How I made this film?

1221
02:03:03,613 --> 02:03:07,322
The story is about someone else,
and it's got my name.

1222
02:03:07,984 --> 02:03:09,122
No.

1223
02:03:10,553 --> 02:03:12,464
This is your film, Kabir.

1224
02:03:14,056 --> 02:03:15,467
And honestly speaking.

1225
02:03:15,525 --> 02:03:20,372
...this film is more about you,
compared to the rest.

1226
02:03:31,407 --> 02:03:32,442
Thank you.

1227
02:03:33,810 --> 02:03:36,791
We've done three films together.

1228
02:03:38,147 --> 02:03:39,888
And you didn't leave me.

1229
02:03:40,716 --> 02:03:41,786
Actually.

1230
02:03:43,786 --> 02:03:46,528
...you're the first
one that lasted this long.

1231
02:03:49,525 --> 02:03:52,062
You didn't give others a chance.

1232
02:03:52,862 --> 02:03:57,402
You just kept moving ahead,
leaving others behind.

1233
02:04:00,570 --> 02:04:02,379
Maybe I've come too far now..

1234
02:04:04,040 --> 02:04:06,919
...and there's no one around now.

1235
02:04:11,113 --> 02:04:12,751
Sometimes I think"

1236
02:04:14,650 --> 02:04:17,153
...did I leave them
or did they all leave me.

1237
02:04:18,688 --> 02:04:21,760
Hey..what's wrong?

1238
02:04:25,895 --> 02:04:26,930
Nothing.

1239
02:04:29,031 --> 02:04:30,772
First time in my life..

1240
02:04:32,635 --> 02:04:35,741
...I'm feeling lonely.

1241
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:39,183
Dad's no more.

1242
02:04:40,743 --> 02:04:42,882
There was so much
I wanted to tell him.

1243
02:04:44,080 --> 02:04:46,822
And the one I want to talk to..

1244
02:04:48,484 --> 02:04:49,963
"Doesn't want to listen.

1245
02:04:53,422 --> 02:04:57,564
And when I think about everything.

1246
02:04:59,695 --> 02:05:01,003
...I think I deserve it all.

1247
02:05:02,865 --> 02:05:03,843
No..

1248
02:05:04,734 --> 02:05:06,145
No you don't.

1249
02:05:07,737 --> 02:05:08,738
You.

1250
02:05:10,206 --> 02:05:12,117
You've changed, Kabir.

1251
02:05:14,076 --> 02:05:16,056
And maybe..

1252
02:05:17,013 --> 02:05:19,755
...now you know the importance.

1253
02:05:19,916 --> 02:05:21,691
"Which you didn't earlier.

1254
02:05:26,923 --> 02:05:28,095
Are you flirting with me?

1255
02:05:29,525 --> 02:05:30,526
You wish..

1256
02:05:32,962 --> 02:05:36,239
Come on..lrani must
be waiting for me.

1257
02:05:36,599 --> 02:05:38,101
Oh, G0d..

1258
02:05:38,968 --> 02:05:40,709
When will lrani's drama
ever come to an end.

1259
02:05:43,639 --> 02:05:44,640
Let's go.

1260
02:05:50,079 --> 02:05:53,026
I thought maybe this was
the biggest mistake of my life.

1261
02:05:53,082 --> 02:05:55,562
Maybe this is the film
which will make me bankrupt.

1262
02:05:56,585 --> 02:05:58,929
But thank you, Kabir. Thank you.

1263
02:06:00,489 --> 02:06:03,026
We've got the biggest
opening of the year.

1264
02:06:03,192 --> 02:06:04,227
Cheers.

1265
02:06:05,594 --> 02:06:06,538
Cheers.

1266
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:39,039
What are you doing here?

1267
02:06:39,795 --> 02:06:41,365
Are you following me?

1268
02:06:43,499 --> 02:06:46,639
I never imagined this
story would end like this.

1269
02:06:49,005 --> 02:06:49,915
Me neither.

1270
02:06:52,475 --> 02:06:54,978
Now I know,
life can never be contained.

1271
02:06:55,778 --> 02:06:58,952
...in small boxes
like in comic books.

1272
02:07:01,350 --> 02:07:02,385
N ow?

1273
02:07:05,154 --> 02:07:06,360
What next?

1274
02:07:09,959 --> 02:07:11,131
I don't know.

1275
02:07:15,464 --> 02:07:16,499
Look..

1276
02:07:18,100 --> 02:07:21,411
...our questions were similar,
and so were the answers.

1277
02:07:23,973 --> 02:07:26,852
Out story star-ted in the same way.

1278
02:07:29,645 --> 02:07:31,147
And it will end in the same way.

1279
02:10:18,480 --> 02:10:19,982
Must be a really interesting book.

1280
02:10:26,722 --> 02:10:27,894
Hi.

1281
02:10:31,994 --> 02:10:33,598
So..you're off to Hong Kong?

1282
02:10:35,197 --> 02:10:36,835
How do you know?

1283
02:10:39,535 --> 02:10:42,448
The newspapers are flooded
with your pictures these days.

1284
02:10:46,108 --> 02:10:47,951
What are you doing here, Kabir?

1285
02:10:54,183 --> 02:10:55,753
I am here to see you, Ayesha.

1286
02:10:56,852 --> 02:10:59,628
Last and final call for passenger
Ms. Ayesha Amir travelling on

1287
02:10:59,688 --> 02:11:03,192
British airways flight no.
BA 232 to Hong Kong.

1288
02:11:03,792 --> 02:11:05,863
Please reach immediately.

1289
02:11:06,462 --> 02:11:07,600
That's my flight.

1290
02:11:14,203 --> 02:11:15,648
I have to go.

1291
02:11:16,238 --> 02:11:17,182
Kabir...!

1292
02:11:18,841 --> 02:11:20,650
You have many questions, don't you?

1293
02:11:21,877 --> 02:11:23,185
I have the answers.

1294
02:11:25,948 --> 02:11:28,724
So, if you stop running,
then maybe..

1295
02:11:29,985 --> 02:11:31,487
...I can give you your answers.

1296
02:11:37,059 --> 02:11:38,834
Nothing is a coincidence, Ayesha.

1297
02:11:40,296 --> 02:11:41,798
Not even our meeting.

1298
02:12:04,386 --> 02:12:05,865
When you came in my life..

1299
02:12:08,324 --> 02:12:10,395
...you became a pan of my story.

1300
02:12:12,795 --> 02:12:14,638
And you gave me a story.

1301
02:12:16,999 --> 02:12:20,811
"Which brought me closer to myself.

1302
02:12:38,587 --> 02:12:40,123
All I know is..

1303
02:12:44,426 --> 02:12:46,064
...I don't want to lose you, Ayesha.

1304
02:12:59,808 --> 02:13:04,814
And if you still
want to go away, then"

1305
02:13:21,897 --> 02:13:23,808
I saw your film.

1306
02:13:27,503 --> 02:13:29,642
And, how was it?

1307
02:13:46,922 --> 02:13:51,598
British airway flight no. BA 232
to Hong Kong is now ready to depart

1308
02:14:40,375 --> 02:14:41,376
Roy.

1309
02:14:54,456 --> 02:14:56,333
I thought you would never ask.

1310
02:14:58,627 --> 02:15:00,038
I thought you won't come.

1311
02:16:01,924 --> 02:16:07,602
"You fell in me drop by drop."

1312
02:16:08,497 --> 02:16:13,947
"And you were more
in me than myself."

1313
02:16:14,670 --> 02:16:20,985
"I felt your wet body."

1314
02:16:21,043 --> 02:16:28,860
"Come, I wish I could drink you."

1315
02:16:30,719 --> 02:16:36,397
"There is ego left in me."

1316
02:16:36,592 --> 02:16:43,407
"Look, there is no ego in you too."

1317
02:16:43,599 --> 02:16:49,072
"I am getting burnt
with hot breaths."

1318
02:16:49,471 --> 02:16:56,582
"You are melting in me."

1319
02:17:02,084 --> 02:17:05,122
"I burn slowly."

1320
02:17:05,454 --> 02:17:08,458
"I meet with your shyness."

1321
02:17:08,624 --> 02:17:14,836
"I will melt your wax body."

1322
02:17:14,963 --> 02:17:21,141
"Even my twists and turns
are fed up when you are with me."

1323
02:17:21,503 --> 02:17:28,011
"I will burn every pan of you."

1324
02:17:28,410 --> 02:17:34,554
"I felt your wet body."

1325
02:17:34,816 --> 02:17:42,030
"Come, I wish I could drink you."

1326
02:17:56,705 --> 02:17:59,743
"Let's make some mistakes."

1327
02:17:59,841 --> 02:18:02,913
"This exploring fingers."

1328
02:18:03,011 --> 02:18:09,428
"Let them feel your body."

1329
02:18:09,484 --> 02:18:15,799
"Are you a hot moment
or a boiling ice."

1330
02:18:15,857 --> 02:18:22,672
"Come waste yourself on me."

1331
02:18:22,831 --> 02:18:29,009
"I felt your wet body."

1332
02:18:29,171 --> 02:18:37,454
"Come, I wish I could drink you."

1333
02:18:38,747 --> 02:18:44,493
"There is ego left in me."

1334
02:18:44,720 --> 02:18:51,569
"Look, there is no ego in you too."

1335
02:18:51,693 --> 02:18:57,473
"I am getting burnt
with hot breaths."

1336
02:18:57,566 --> 02:19:04,506
"You are melting in me."
