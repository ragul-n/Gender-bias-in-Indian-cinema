1
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:26,521
When we come into this world...

2
00:00:26,721 --> 00:00:28,521
God shows us everyone around us.

3
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:31,281
Grandpa, Mummy, Papa...

4
00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:34,521
aunt Maya, uncles and aunts...

5
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:38,281
the tiny kids...

6
00:00:38,721 --> 00:00:40,281
and my best friend Rhea

7
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:44,720
But there is that one face
that He does not show us.

8
00:00:44,721 --> 00:00:45,921
I wonder why

9
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:48,521
That one face He hides from us

10
00:00:49,721 --> 00:00:52,121
The face we come
to fall in love with

11
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,521
NEITHER TOY NOR I CAN KNOW

12
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:25,721
* Daughters are treated like Queens
* by their fathers

13
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:37,721
* Daughters are treated like Queens
* by their fathers

14
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:44,121
* Theirs is a story
* so loveable and beautiful

15
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:49,521
* They're delicate little dolls...

16
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:53,721
* and there's no saying
* who will take them away

17
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,721
* Daughters are treated like Queens
* by their fathers

18
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:09,121
* Theirs is a story
* so loveable and beautiful

19
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,721
When I left my house and came here
for the first time, I had wept.

20
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:26,121
And now that it is time
to return home...

21
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:29,521
tears flow from my eyes again

22
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:18,721
* Daughters are treated like Queens
* by their fathers

23
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:28,721
* Daughters are treated like Queens
* by their mothers

24
00:03:30,721 --> 00:03:33,121
* Theirs is a story
* so loveable and beautiful

25
00:03:35,721 --> 00:03:37,521
* God is their protector...

26
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:40,121
* they spend a childhood
* in innocence...

27
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,121
* they're innocent even
* in adolescence

28
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:48,721
* Daughters are treated like Queens
* by their mothers

29
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:54,121
* Theirs is a story
* so very loveable

30
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:19,721
* They rule every heart.
* They're treated like queens

31
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:30,721
* They rule every heart.
* They're treated like queens

32
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:35,121
* They're birds who will
* one day fly away

33
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:40,721
* Let no one leave their hand,
* let no one hurt them...

34
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:44,521
* they're blessings from God

35
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:51,721
* Daughters are treated like Queens
* by their fathers

36
00:04:53,721 --> 00:04:56,121
* Theirs is a story
* so loveable

37
00:05:06,721 --> 00:05:09,721
I have everything, but I don't know
who will come into my life...

38
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:15,281
and belong to me

39
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,121
Dear God, to begin with,
I'm sorry...

40
00:05:58,721 --> 00:06:00,720
for not writing to you
in all these days

41
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:03,720
I missed my family very much
while I was in the hostel

42
00:06:03,721 --> 00:06:06,720
I'm sure You looked after everyone
while I was away

43
00:06:06,721 --> 00:06:09,721
In fact, I think You have
paid more attention to grandpa

44
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:12,521
He has put on weight, hasn't he?

45
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:16,521
With lots of love - Esha

46
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:22,281
To Him... like this.

47
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:25,721
If you don't pray to God,
how will He protect you?

48
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,720
You can protect me. That's the duty
God has assigned to you.

49
00:06:31,721 --> 00:06:33,521
Didn't He tell you...?
- Esha!

50
00:06:34,721 --> 00:06:37,721
Grandpa, I don't even know
if God actually exists.

51
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:41,721
You are the one I see all the time.
So whenever I have a problem...

52
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:46,721
won't I come to you?
- Trust in God and you will know...

53
00:06:48,721 --> 00:06:51,721
that He's always with you.
- But I haven't even seen Him.

54
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:56,721
So how can I have trust in Him?
- Trust doesn't flow...

55
00:06:57,721 --> 00:07:00,721
out of what you just see, Esha.
It comes from the heart, from belief'

56
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:07,121
Close your eyes and pray to Him...

57
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:10,521
and you will yourself believe

58
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:26,121
Karan is the most handsome guy
in the world!

59
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:29,721
Karan, have uncle and aunt employed
a new chauffeur?

60
00:07:30,721 --> 00:07:33,721
Esha, Priya's in love again.
- How will she know what love is?

61
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:38,720
Oh yes.
Esha won't even talk to boys.

62
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:41,121
And that's because she
can talk only to Tutu

63
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:44,721
To fall in love, you must
first like the boy...

64
00:07:46,721 --> 00:07:49,121
followed by endless chats,
friendship and...

65
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,121
And?
- And love happens on its own

66
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,281
You belong to me

67
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:14,721
I realise today how everything
changes on someone's arrival

68
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:20,721
When I'm asleep or awake, there's
someone with me all the time

69
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:23,720
I felt lonely in a crowd earlier...

70
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:26,720
and although I'm all alone now,
I feel someone's presence with me

71
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:29,121
Do you feel that too?
I belong to you.

72
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:32,521
Who is it? When did you meet him?

73
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:38,720
This is Bingo and you're listening
to your favourite show...

74
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:41,121
falling in love
while listening

75
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:49,720
If there is something you want to
convey to someone, do it through us...

76
00:08:49,721 --> 00:08:51,521
with all your heart and love...

77
00:08:51,721 --> 00:08:54,721
and we will carry your message
to the one you love

78
00:08:57,721 --> 00:09:00,721
Who knows...? You might
fall in love, while you listen!

79
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:11,281
Who am I talking to?

80
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:15,281
I can't talk to a crowd

81
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:20,521
Can you play any song for me?

82
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:23,121
Of course! I can even sing for you.

83
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:27,721
"Is this love?"
- Sure, if you keep calling in

84
00:09:32,721 --> 00:09:35,121
You haven't told me
your boyfriend's name

85
00:09:35,721 --> 00:09:38,721
The one you want to play a song for.
- I don't have a boyfriend

86
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:42,721
But there is someone
I want to play this song for

87
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:48,121
He's the one I think about
some times

88
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,121
The thought of it brings
a smile to my lips

89
00:09:52,721 --> 00:09:55,121
Whose voice I know,
deep down in my heart

90
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,281
I wait for the one...

91
00:09:59,721 --> 00:10:02,721
who's in love with love.
- What's gotten into you, Esha?

92
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:06,720
Since when have you been thinking
about these matters of the heart?

93
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:09,721
Don't give me those looks, Rhea.
I haven't written this

94
00:10:10,721 --> 00:10:13,121
I found it in a book
in the college

95
00:10:13,721 --> 00:10:16,121
I didn't even know
who had written it

96
00:10:16,721 --> 00:10:19,121
But it felt as if it was
meant for me

97
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:23,721
And when I heard his voice,
I was convinced...

98
00:10:29,721 --> 00:10:32,720
I want to say something to the girl
who called from Simla Boarding College

99
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:35,720
Simla? There was no call from Simla.
- It's the one who requested...

100
00:10:35,721 --> 00:10:38,121
my favourite number,
"Is this love"?

101
00:10:41,721 --> 00:10:44,720
Not yet... but if she's listening
to this programme...

102
00:10:44,721 --> 00:10:47,121
she'll surely be.
- I don't know who you are

103
00:10:50,721 --> 00:10:53,721
But I have a feeling that maybe
you are the one I wrote that for

104
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:59,721
The one I wait for. The one
who's in love with love, like me.

105
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:07,720
I don't even know
if you're listening to this...

106
00:11:07,721 --> 00:11:10,721
but Bingu, I really wish
I could get to meet her

107
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:14,720
I think it's possible. In fact,
I can do something about it

108
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:17,721
I want the two of you to come to
my studio at 6 pm on November 12

109
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,121
Let's hope she's listening
to this programme

110
00:11:26,721 --> 00:11:29,721
I knew it! She had to fall in love,
even while she listened!

111
00:11:31,721 --> 00:11:33,281
On November 12 at 6 pm

112
00:11:52,721 --> 00:11:55,121
Bingo, there's someone here
to see you

113
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:03,921
Is she...?

114
00:12:06,721 --> 00:12:08,720
She's been waiting for you
since last evening

115
00:12:08,721 --> 00:12:11,721
She hasn't come personally.
She has sent this note for you

116
00:12:14,721 --> 00:12:16,281
A note?
- Yes

117
00:12:30,721 --> 00:12:32,521
Did he show up?
- He did

118
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:36,121
And maybe you want to know
what he looks like

119
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:42,121
6 feet in height and...
- Bingo...

120
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:45,121
I don't want to know
anything about him

121
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:47,521
You ought to have met him

122
00:12:48,721 --> 00:12:50,521
I'll surely meet him some day

123
00:12:53,721 --> 00:12:56,721
When I heard your voice on radio,
I badly wanted to meet you

124
00:12:58,721 --> 00:13:01,721
But then I thought, it wasn't right.
I study in Simla...

125
00:13:02,721 --> 00:13:04,720
in perhaps the same college
that you have you studied in

126
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:07,721
My house is in DehraDun.
I'm away from home, no doubt...

127
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:12,121
but I carry the faith
of my folks with me

128
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:15,721
I can't tell you anything about myself
right now. Not even my name

129
00:13:17,721 --> 00:13:20,721
And I won't ask you your name either,
or where your house is...

130
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:25,721
or what you do for a living.
But I sure want to be friends with you

131
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:32,721
The day I am confident that I can
introduce you to my folks...

132
00:13:35,721 --> 00:13:38,121
I will tell you everything
about myself

133
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:40,720
Till then, we'll write
to each other

134
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:43,720
You might probably not even
want to write to me...

135
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:46,720
for all the conditions I impose.
However, if you wish...

136
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:48,521
you can write to me at PO Box 235

137
00:13:51,721 --> 00:13:53,281
I want a post-box.

138
00:13:53,721 --> 00:13:56,121
Fill up this form and
pay a deposit

139
00:13:57,721 --> 00:14:00,121
Sir, why do they go in
for a post-box?

140
00:14:00,721 --> 00:14:04,321
A post-box is meant for those who don't
want to reveal their name and address

141
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:08,720
With every post-box, we give
them a number and a key

142
00:14:08,721 --> 00:14:11,720
This number becomes their address.
- And the key?

143
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:14,721
The one who receives mail can
open the box and take it away

144
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:22,721
Four years ago, when I jotted
something on a book in the college...

145
00:14:23,721 --> 00:14:26,121
I didn't even imagine
someone would find it

146
00:14:27,721 --> 00:14:30,721
Least of all, someone who
thought so much like me

147
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:33,281
I have faith...

148
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:36,721
that God has decided something
for each one of us

149
00:14:38,721 --> 00:14:41,721
He knows when, where and how
we will meet someone

150
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,721
Maybe He has decided something
for the two of us, too

151
00:14:52,721 --> 00:14:55,121
Let's see how He brings us together

152
00:14:56,721 --> 00:14:59,121
There are things we
must leave to Him

153
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:02,121
If this letter brings a smile
to your lips...

154
00:15:03,721 --> 00:15:06,721
we are friends already. You don't
want to know anything about me...

155
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:11,121
but there is something
I want to tell you

156
00:15:12,721 --> 00:15:13,921
I'm a dreamer

157
00:15:15,721 --> 00:15:17,521
And maybe I have already met you

158
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,121
Why didn't you tell him your name?

159
00:15:24,721 --> 00:15:27,721
I can't break grandpa's trust
for the sake of my love, Rhea

160
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:34,121
Our relationship needs
some more time

161
00:15:36,721 --> 00:15:39,721
Until I to trust him enough to
introduce him to Grandpa...

162
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:43,281
I will not meet him too

163
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:46,721
But he can meet you, can't he?
He has your address

164
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:50,721
No. Every student at the college
has a separate post-box number

165
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:53,521
What will I do over here?

166
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,720
We'll go to the post office tomorrow
and hire a post-box

167
00:15:57,721 --> 00:16:00,721
Two, not one. I think I must
start writing to Karan too

168
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:06,721
Esha, don't you want to know
what he looks like?

169
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:10,121
I know how he looks...
want to see his photo?

170
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:52,521
* I felt as if I had met him

171
00:16:56,721 --> 00:16:58,521
* I felt as if I had lost my heart

172
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,281
* Who is he...?

173
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:05,921
* Tell us

174
00:17:07,721 --> 00:17:09,521
* How and where did it all happen?

175
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,281
* Your sleep...

176
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:13,281
* he has vanished with

177
00:18:14,721 --> 00:18:15,921
* Dreams...

178
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,281
* he has given me

179
00:18:34,721 --> 00:18:37,121
* It shouldn't have happened.
* But it's true

180
00:18:40,721 --> 00:18:43,121
* Days have shortened...
* my nights are longer

181
00:18:46,721 --> 00:18:48,281
* Who is he...?

182
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:49,921
* Tell us

183
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:59,521
* I felt as if I had met him

184
00:19:03,721 --> 00:19:05,521
* I felt as if I had lost my heart

185
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:10,281
* Who is he...?

186
00:19:11,721 --> 00:19:12,921
* Tell us

187
00:19:13,721 --> 00:19:15,521
* How and where did it all happen?

188
00:19:59,721 --> 00:20:01,281
* What happens now...?

189
00:20:02,721 --> 00:20:04,521
* It has already happened

190
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:07,281
* Your heart...

191
00:20:07,721 --> 00:20:09,281
* I have already lost

192
00:20:25,721 --> 00:20:28,121
* He's mad.
* He has driven me crazy too

193
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:33,721
* I've survived, but he has left me
* wounded in the heart

194
00:20:36,721 --> 00:20:38,281
* Who is he...?

195
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:40,921
* Tell us

196
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:44,521
* How and when did it all happen?

197
00:20:47,721 --> 00:20:49,521
* I felt as if I had met him

198
00:20:53,721 --> 00:20:55,521
* I felt as if I had lost my heart

199
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:01,281
* Who is he...?

200
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:03,921
* Tell us

201
00:21:06,721 --> 00:21:08,521
* How and where did it all happen?

202
00:22:17,721 --> 00:22:19,521
Close your eyes.
- What for?

203
00:22:28,721 --> 00:22:29,681
Monty!

204
00:22:30,721 --> 00:22:32,281
No... I'm Akshay

205
00:22:32,721 --> 00:22:33,921
No! Monty!

206
00:22:37,721 --> 00:22:39,521
Who's that?
- My boyfriend

207
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:51,281
Stop him someone!

208
00:23:29,721 --> 00:23:32,721
Madam, how will he shoot?
Your kid won't stop hollering

209
00:23:33,721 --> 00:23:35,521
That's how my kid is, lady

210
00:23:36,721 --> 00:23:38,521
He has done 50 ads already

211
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:40,521
For sweets and vegetable dishes

212
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:44,121
I don't know what's gotten
into him over here

213
00:23:44,721 --> 00:23:47,721
Know what? He's Sunny Deol!
He'll grow up to be Dharmendra!

214
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,720
Shut up now, or I'll give you
a slap when we get home!

215
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:56,121
You're embarrassing me!
- What happened

216
00:23:56,721 --> 00:23:58,521
This child won't stop crying

217
00:24:07,721 --> 00:24:09,281
He's laughing already!

218
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:12,521
Are you married?
- No

219
00:24:12,721 --> 00:24:14,720
Hold the kid, girl...
what are you doing?

220
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:17,121
Rahul, you're so handsome!
Know what...?

221
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:19,720
The sight of my husband's face,
scares him.

222
00:24:19,721 --> 00:24:22,720
But he was happy to see your eyes.
You have lovely cheeks...

223
00:24:22,721 --> 00:24:25,121
and a great smile.
I wish you had married me!

224
00:24:25,721 --> 00:24:27,281
Will you marry me?

225
00:24:28,721 --> 00:24:30,521
At least give me a kiss!

226
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:36,121
Save me, please...
- One moment. I get it

227
00:24:39,721 --> 00:24:41,720
Who was it this time?
- It's Monty

228
00:24:41,721 --> 00:24:44,720
Congratulations! You now have
boys chasing you too!

229
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:47,721
He has boys chasing him?
What a loose-character!

230
00:24:52,721 --> 00:24:54,720
What have you done now?
- I've done nothing

231
00:24:54,721 --> 00:24:56,720
How was I to know that
there was a boyfriend?

232
00:24:56,721 --> 00:24:59,121
Monty's boyfriend?
- Not Monty's! Tina's!

233
00:25:00,721 --> 00:25:03,721
Had those hands got to me,
I wouldn't have a bone in order

234
00:25:04,721 --> 00:25:06,521
Tina's...?
- Monty's!

235
00:25:07,721 --> 00:25:10,721
I wish, I had not kissed her
on the very first date

236
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:13,521
Kissed Monty?
- No! Tina!

237
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,521
Who'd want to kiss Monty!

238
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:22,720
She has lips like grapes,
raisins for eyes...

239
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:25,721
and pomegranate seeds for teeth
and cheeks like apples from Kashmir!

240
00:25:27,721 --> 00:25:29,521
Is that a girl or a fruit-salad?

241
00:25:30,721 --> 00:25:32,281
Watch it, just watch it

242
00:25:33,721 --> 00:25:35,521
I am a-kela (alone and a banana)

243
00:25:41,721 --> 00:25:43,521
Just save me!
- From whom?

244
00:25:43,721 --> 00:25:44,921
From Monty

245
00:25:48,721 --> 00:25:51,721
The bloody ape! Ass, elephant,
a two-legged rhinoceros!

246
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:57,121
He wants to marry Tina!
The Moron!

247
00:25:58,721 --> 00:26:01,720
I hope Monty's deaf, too.
- He's actually Monty Mehra

248
00:26:01,721 --> 00:26:04,121
Mehra? You're getting beaten up then.
- Why?

249
00:26:04,721 --> 00:26:07,121
You're going to get a thrashing.
- But why?

250
00:26:10,721 --> 00:26:11,921
One minute...

251
00:26:12,721 --> 00:26:15,720
Break his bones, if you must.
But not things around

252
00:26:15,721 --> 00:26:18,721
What's up with you?
We've only been talking... I swear

253
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:27,121
Misuse your eyes,
and this is what will happen

254
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:30,720
Mustn't I return the look,
if someone looks at me lovingly?

255
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:32,521
Sure, go ahead. But how often?

256
00:26:34,721 --> 00:26:37,121
And this isn't love that
happens all the time

257
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,720
You talk as if you've fallen
in love many times

258
00:26:40,721 --> 00:26:43,721
Have you made a single girlfriend?
- A single...? Great!

259
00:26:44,721 --> 00:26:47,121
Idiot! A single girlfriend
is all you need

260
00:26:47,721 --> 00:26:49,281
A single girlfriend...?

261
00:26:50,721 --> 00:26:52,281
What if she takes ill?

262
00:26:52,721 --> 00:26:55,720
Which means there is no girl
you can ever fall in love with

263
00:26:55,721 --> 00:26:58,721
That's the one I'm looking for.
- You won't need to look

264
00:27:00,721 --> 00:27:03,121
When you see her,
you'll know that for sure

265
00:27:04,721 --> 00:27:07,121
Maybe I will.
But how about you?

266
00:27:08,721 --> 00:27:09,681
What?

267
00:27:11,721 --> 00:27:14,721
I always meant to ask you.
You meet so many girls...

268
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:17,521
but who's she going to be?

269
00:27:29,721 --> 00:27:32,720
She's going to be someone
with child-like innocence...

270
00:27:32,721 --> 00:27:35,121
but have the maturity
of an adult too

271
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:39,521
She's going to be so beautiful...

272
00:27:39,721 --> 00:27:42,121
that I'll want to keep
looking at her

273
00:27:43,721 --> 00:27:46,121
Her smile will bring
a smile on every lip

274
00:27:48,721 --> 00:27:49,921
Whose eyes...

275
00:27:51,721 --> 00:27:54,121
won't ever make her
want to lie

276
00:27:54,721 --> 00:27:56,281
That's how she will be

277
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,281
* I'm a crazy Jat...

278
00:28:04,721 --> 00:28:06,521
* I couldn't see the obvious...

279
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:10,521
* that she's in love with me

280
00:28:13,721 --> 00:28:15,521
* that she could die for me

281
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:27,720
I was trying to tell you that
there was a letter for you...

282
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:30,720
but you just wouldn't understand.
- My letter!

283
00:28:30,721 --> 00:28:33,121
Let's decide on a signal first.
- A signal?

284
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:36,721
Yes. This is what I'll do
when there's a letter for you

285
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:46,721
There are times when you don't
need music to listen to a tune

286
00:28:56,721 --> 00:28:59,721
There is no need for rains
for a flower to blossom

287
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:06,721
To listen to what the heart says,
you don't need words

288
00:29:39,721 --> 00:29:42,121
Tell me... what is
your favourite colour?

289
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:45,521
My favourite colour? Blue.

290
00:29:48,721 --> 00:29:50,281
That's mine too.

291
00:29:51,721 --> 00:29:54,121
What is it that brings
a smile to your face?

292
00:29:56,721 --> 00:29:58,281
Rains. And hot jalebis.

293
00:30:00,721 --> 00:30:02,281
I love the rains.

294
00:30:03,721 --> 00:30:05,281
And...?
- And...

295
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,521
I love the laughter of children

296
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:13,721
When do I get the feeling that your
laughter is like that of a child?

297
00:30:15,721 --> 00:30:17,521
I don't know. Maybe it is

298
00:30:17,721 --> 00:30:19,521
And what do you like?
- Me?

299
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:27,921
I like you

300
00:30:31,721 --> 00:30:33,281
Tomorrow's my birthday

301
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:36,521
So send me a birthday present

302
00:30:36,721 --> 00:30:39,721
I wish I'd find you when I open
the envelope for your letter

303
00:30:45,721 --> 00:30:48,721
I can't come personally,
so I'm sending Tutu to you

304
00:30:49,721 --> 00:30:51,720
He has been with me with
ever since I was a child...

305
00:30:51,721 --> 00:30:54,121
and he'll now remain with you forever

306
00:30:54,721 --> 00:30:57,121
It's amazing, we're alike
in everything

307
00:30:58,721 --> 00:31:00,521
But there's something else too...

308
00:31:01,721 --> 00:31:03,521
which both of us have.
- What?

309
00:31:33,721 --> 00:31:35,281
Who marries so early?

310
00:31:35,721 --> 00:31:38,721
I lead a free life. I come home,
have fun, chill out...

311
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:42,720
If I were married, the moment the
door opened, my wife would say...

312
00:31:42,721 --> 00:31:44,281
Akshay! You're so late!

313
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:48,521
I hope this is my house!

314
00:31:52,721 --> 00:31:55,720
Akshay, you didn't tell me
you have approved of a girl?

315
00:31:55,721 --> 00:31:58,720
Rahul, you didn't tell me either.
The two of you are as thick as thieves

316
00:31:58,721 --> 00:32:01,720
How was I to know that you're in such
a tearing hurry to get married?

317
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:03,720
When did I know that either?
- My child...

318
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:06,721
won't you introduce Akshay
to your Mummy and Papa?

319
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:11,521
Mama, Papa, this is Akshay

320
00:32:12,721 --> 00:32:13,921
Hello, son

321
00:32:14,721 --> 00:32:17,721
This is Rahul, Akshay's friend.
But he's like my son too

322
00:32:18,721 --> 00:32:21,720
Rahul and Akshay have been together
since they were kids

323
00:32:21,721 --> 00:32:24,721
Even brothers fight.
But between the two of them... never

324
00:32:25,721 --> 00:32:28,721
Here's your opportunity.
Tell them that I'm a terrible guy

325
00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:32,720
We've heard Tanya telling us
so much about you

326
00:32:32,721 --> 00:32:34,521
Akshay is all praise for you too

327
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:38,720
But this is the first time
we're meeting Akshay

328
00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:41,721
Really? But you don't know, uncle.
Akshay always wanted to meet you

329
00:32:42,721 --> 00:32:45,720
But he's one of those shy-types...
so he didn't come to you

330
00:32:45,721 --> 00:32:49,321
I'm glad you came here. Had he asked
for more today, maybe he'd have got it

331
00:32:49,721 --> 00:32:52,121
You can't even imagine how happy I am

332
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,721
Look at them. They look so good
together... Akshay and Tanya

333
00:33:01,721 --> 00:33:04,721
What's happening here, Tanya?
- We're getting married

334
00:33:05,721 --> 00:33:08,720
You told me that we would
be getting married soon

335
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:11,720
Sure, but I didn't mean to say
it'd happen in a day or two

336
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:13,281
But what's the problem?

337
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:20,721
Will you be able to bear the shock?
So listen!

338
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:26,121
My mother is the typical
mother-in-law

339
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:32,721
She's giving a smile right now.
But deep down in her heart...

340
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,121
she must be planning to
torture you

341
00:33:38,721 --> 00:33:40,281
As for my dad...

342
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:44,121
I don't even know what
a father's love means

343
00:33:46,721 --> 00:33:48,521
Money means everything to him

344
00:33:51,721 --> 00:33:54,721
He wants a Ferari in dowry,
a flat in London...

345
00:33:55,721 --> 00:33:57,281
and lots of cash!

346
00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:06,281
But you need not worry

347
00:34:07,721 --> 00:34:10,721
The day I get to stand on my own
two feet, we'll get married

348
00:34:12,721 --> 00:34:15,121
lt'll be only you and me...
at my beach-house

349
00:34:20,721 --> 00:34:23,721
But right now, we must stay away
from each other

350
00:34:26,721 --> 00:34:28,521
You understand, don't you?

351
00:34:36,721 --> 00:34:39,121
Let's go.
- What happened, my child?

352
00:34:39,721 --> 00:34:42,720
Aunty, I do want to be
your daughter-in-law...

353
00:34:42,721 --> 00:34:45,721
but I can't marry your son.
Because he's a liar

354
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:52,721
Akshay, you should have tried
telling me the truth

355
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:58,721
I fell in love with you
without any conditions

356
00:34:59,721 --> 00:35:02,721
But you won't understand that
because you have never been in love

357
00:35:26,721 --> 00:35:28,521
A girl like Tanya can't...

358
00:35:44,721 --> 00:35:47,121
Don't worry, Ma.
Everything will be all right

359
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:50,281
What will be all right?

360
00:35:50,721 --> 00:35:53,121
He's not going to marry
a girl of our choice

361
00:35:53,721 --> 00:35:56,721
As for deciding it on his own,
this is an everyday affair...

362
00:35:57,721 --> 00:36:00,121
Listen to me, Ma.
I'll find a girl for Akshay

363
00:36:01,721 --> 00:36:04,721
Just the kind of girl all of us want.
And Akshay will marry her too

364
00:36:07,721 --> 00:36:09,720
And know what?
She'll be such a chatter-box...

365
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:12,720
she's going to come out of your ears!
She'll make you laugh so much...

366
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:15,121
the laughter will resonate
in the household

367
00:36:15,721 --> 00:36:17,720
She'll feed you so much,
you'll put on more weight!

368
00:36:17,721 --> 00:36:20,121
And know what?
You'll love her a lot too

369
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:23,720
But you must promise me something.
When she arrives...

370
00:36:23,721 --> 00:36:25,521
I won't get lesser love, will I?

371
00:36:32,721 --> 00:36:34,720
This year, we've got to
find a photographer...

372
00:36:34,721 --> 00:36:36,720
for our departmental store's
fashion magazine

373
00:36:36,721 --> 00:36:39,720
But we've got to be very careful
with it, because...

374
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:42,121
this magazine will carry
only bridal pictures

375
00:36:42,721 --> 00:36:45,720
Do you like any of them?
- I like this one very much

376
00:36:45,721 --> 00:36:47,521
Why?
- In this photograph...

377
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:51,720
the bride's apprehensions and happiness
are very effectively captured

378
00:36:51,721 --> 00:36:54,721
I think whoever the photographer is,
he knows a girl's mind very well

379
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:59,721
Wow, my child! You've looked at
something all of us missed out

380
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:04,721
The responsibility of this fashion
magazine, I entrust to you

381
00:37:06,721 --> 00:37:09,121
Grandpa, why don't we do
a music video?

382
00:37:10,721 --> 00:37:13,721
Everybody watches tv nowadays.
It'll be good for our store too

383
00:37:14,721 --> 00:37:16,720
That's a good idea.
But who will do it?

384
00:37:16,721 --> 00:37:19,720
Anna! Remember, she did our
fashion show last year?

385
00:37:19,721 --> 00:37:22,721
She must surely know someone in Mumbai
who can do a music video

386
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:27,721
I'll telephone her right now!
- Make a call to the photographer too

387
00:37:28,721 --> 00:37:29,681
Sure

388
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:39,721
Can I speak to Mr Rahul Sharma?
- This is Rahul here

389
00:37:40,721 --> 00:37:42,281
I'm Esha Malhotra

390
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:46,321
We come out with a fashion magazine
for our departmental store every year

391
00:37:46,721 --> 00:37:50,321
We want you to come over this year
and take photographs for the magazine

392
00:37:51,721 --> 00:37:53,521
Interesting. What's the theme?

393
00:37:58,721 --> 00:38:00,720
Have you chosen the models?
- No

394
00:38:00,721 --> 00:38:03,720
But we're holding an audition here.
You can come over and select them

395
00:38:03,721 --> 00:38:06,121
And where are we shooting it?
- In DehraDun

396
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:11,721
DehraDun?
- I know it's far away from your city

397
00:38:13,721 --> 00:38:15,521
But it's only for a few days

398
00:38:16,721 --> 00:38:19,721
I'm sorry, I won't be able to come.
- Why not?

399
00:38:20,721 --> 00:38:23,720
I forget all about a promise
I made to someone

400
00:38:23,721 --> 00:38:26,121
Honestly, I can't come
even if I want to

401
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:45,121
They loved your idea
of a music video.

402
00:38:45,721 --> 00:38:48,721
Have you spoken to the photographer?
- I have, grandpa. But I think...

403
00:38:56,721 --> 00:38:59,121
This is Rahul here.
Rahul Sharma

404
00:39:00,721 --> 00:39:03,121
I've called to tell you
that I can come over

405
00:39:05,721 --> 00:39:08,721
When are you coming?
- I'll fax all the details to you

406
00:39:09,721 --> 00:39:11,521
But there's a problem.
- What?

407
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:13,281
Call me just Rahul

408
00:40:01,721 --> 00:40:03,281
It was great fun!

409
00:40:09,721 --> 00:40:11,521
I've personally painted it

410
00:40:13,721 --> 00:40:15,281
Is this a guest-house?

411
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:18,521
This is the rehearsal hall

412
00:40:18,721 --> 00:40:21,721
I've called a lot of models for
the fashion magazine's audition

413
00:40:29,721 --> 00:40:31,521
I called so many times...

414
00:40:34,721 --> 00:40:37,720
Go upstairs, Rahul.
It's on the first floor...

415
00:40:37,721 --> 00:40:40,721
No, the second door...
and Esha's waiting for you

416
00:40:42,721 --> 00:40:44,720
I'm terribly angry with you.
- I'm angry too!

417
00:40:44,721 --> 00:40:47,121
I called so many times.
And where were you?

418
00:40:59,721 --> 00:41:01,521
He sure has ruined the mood!

419
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:13,721
You're here for the audition?
Do you have your photographs?

420
00:41:14,721 --> 00:41:17,121
No photographs,
but I do have a camera

421
00:41:27,721 --> 00:41:29,521
I'm sorry, I didn't recognise you

422
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:34,721
This is the first time we've met.
How could you recognise me?

423
00:41:35,721 --> 00:41:37,521
I thought you were a model

424
00:41:40,721 --> 00:41:43,721
Look at my face again...
do I look like a model?

425
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:53,121
Is this how they celebrate
birthdays here?

426
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:55,281
When is yours?

427
00:42:40,721 --> 00:42:42,521
Rahul, this is Esha's Papa

428
00:42:43,721 --> 00:42:45,521
This is Esha's brother, Tinga

429
00:42:45,721 --> 00:42:47,521
Here's the uncle and aunt...

430
00:42:48,721 --> 00:42:51,121
and they're Esha's cousins,
Teeny and Binny

431
00:42:52,721 --> 00:42:55,121
This is Esha's aunt, Maya.
- Greetings

432
00:42:55,721 --> 00:42:57,281
And this is Rahul

433
00:42:58,721 --> 00:43:00,521
And that's...
- Esha's Mummy

434
00:43:01,721 --> 00:43:03,281
Mummy, this is Rahul

435
00:43:05,721 --> 00:43:08,721
Rahul, have lunch and dinner
with us from today

436
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:14,121
Take a family photograph
for us, please

437
00:43:14,721 --> 00:43:17,721
Grandpa, we don't have a single
photograph of the whole family

438
00:43:53,721 --> 00:43:55,281
Just one thing missing

439
00:43:57,721 --> 00:43:58,681
What?

440
00:44:21,721 --> 00:44:22,921
Come on!

441
00:44:30,721 --> 00:44:32,720
Where's the letter, Priya?
- No letter

442
00:44:32,721 --> 00:44:35,720
But you signalled to say that
there was a letter for me

443
00:44:35,721 --> 00:44:37,521
That's because I saw Rahul

444
00:44:37,721 --> 00:44:39,521
Seriously, there's no letter

445
00:44:40,721 --> 00:44:42,521
There's something else this time

446
00:44:44,721 --> 00:44:47,721
Ask him not to send such bulky things.
- What is it? Tell me!

447
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:52,281
Esha, Rahul is leaving

448
00:44:56,721 --> 00:44:59,121
Writing to you today,
I feel as if...

449
00:44:59,721 --> 00:45:02,121
I can feel your face
with my hand

450
00:45:05,721 --> 00:45:08,121
You are very close to me.
So close...

451
00:45:10,721 --> 00:45:13,721
that you melt in my arms
when I stretch them out for you

452
00:45:15,721 --> 00:45:18,721
All this can come true.
I'm sending something for you

453
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:23,721
Whenever you are reminded of me,
it'll draw you close to me

454
00:45:52,721 --> 00:45:55,721
* Why did you call out to me,
* from the depths of your heart?

455
00:45:59,721 --> 00:46:02,721
* Why did you call out to me,
* from the depths of your heart?

456
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:08,521
* God! What have you done?

457
00:46:14,721 --> 00:46:16,521
* God! What have you done?

458
00:46:28,721 --> 00:46:31,721
* Why did you call out to me,
* from the depths of your heart?

459
00:46:35,721 --> 00:46:38,721
* Why did you call out to me,
* from the depths of your heart?

460
00:46:42,721 --> 00:46:44,521
* God... what have I done?

461
00:46:50,721 --> 00:46:52,521
* God... what have I done?

462
00:47:22,721 --> 00:47:25,121
Rahul, your call to Mumbai
has gone through

463
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:32,720
I went to the post-office.
- Any letters for me?

464
00:47:32,721 --> 00:47:35,721
Yes, sir. There was a letter for you
in your post-box

465
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:40,121
Send it to me at this address here

466
00:47:40,721 --> 00:47:41,681
Today

467
00:47:50,721 --> 00:47:53,721
This is for you. We have a reunion
party at our college

468
00:47:54,721 --> 00:47:57,720
There will be music and
a lot of interesting people

469
00:47:57,721 --> 00:48:00,721
The dress code is blue...
you will come, won't you?

470
00:48:05,721 --> 00:48:08,720
I was in another class.
I wouldn't know anyone here

471
00:48:08,721 --> 00:48:11,721
You know me. You know Esha too.
And Esha's coming with us

472
00:48:12,721 --> 00:48:13,681
Where?

473
00:48:14,721 --> 00:48:17,721
There's a party in my college.
Please don't refuse, Esha!

474
00:48:34,721 --> 00:48:37,721
I gave these girls one last
opportunity to talk to me today

475
00:48:39,721 --> 00:48:43,321
They took notes from us at school.
And they won't even recognise us now!

476
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:46,121
They ought to be taught a lesson.
- How?

477
00:48:46,721 --> 00:48:48,521
This is how.
- Booze!

478
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:50,921
Not booze.

479
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,521
This is Rahul, my best friend

480
00:49:02,721 --> 00:49:05,720
Meet Rahul, my childhood friend.
- I've never seen you earlier

481
00:49:05,721 --> 00:49:08,121
Actually we've met today
after our childhood

482
00:49:15,721 --> 00:49:18,121
This is Rahul.
- We're childhood friends

483
00:49:30,721 --> 00:49:33,121
You aren't getting bored, are you?

484
00:49:59,721 --> 00:50:01,521
What's gotten into Esha?

485
00:50:11,721 --> 00:50:14,121
She's drunk!
Do something, Rahul

486
00:50:14,721 --> 00:50:17,121
What can I do?
- If grandpa gets to know...

487
00:50:17,721 --> 00:50:20,720
how Esha behaved at the party,
all hell will break loose

488
00:50:20,721 --> 00:50:22,281
Go and do something

489
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:26,720
Wait... where are you going?
- To stop her of course

490
00:50:26,721 --> 00:50:29,121
No, that won't help.
- Meaning?

491
00:50:29,721 --> 00:50:32,720
Esha's a very stubborn girl.
She won't listen to anyone

492
00:50:32,721 --> 00:50:35,721
If you stop her in that state,
there's no saying what she'll do

493
00:50:36,721 --> 00:50:37,921
So then?

494
00:53:26,721 --> 00:53:28,521
So early in the day today?

495
00:53:29,721 --> 00:53:31,521
Rhea told me about last night

496
00:53:35,721 --> 00:53:38,721
It doesn't appear likely that
you'd be fond of such things

497
00:53:40,721 --> 00:53:41,720
Such as?

498
00:53:41,721 --> 00:53:44,720
I didn't know that drink
was laced with something

499
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,121
It was the first time
I had a drink like that

500
00:53:47,721 --> 00:53:49,281
Oh really?
- Really

501
00:53:53,721 --> 00:53:56,121
After the drink,
you danced very well

502
00:54:02,721 --> 00:54:05,121
I know what happened last night
wasn't right

503
00:54:05,721 --> 00:54:07,521
You do realise your mistake...

504
00:54:10,721 --> 00:54:13,720
It wasn't my mistake.
- Whose mistake is it then?

505
00:54:13,721 --> 00:54:15,720
It's the guy who laced
my drink with something

506
00:54:15,721 --> 00:54:18,720
Esha, you mustn't accept a drink
from a boy you don't know

507
00:54:18,721 --> 00:54:20,521
Please! Stop lecturing me now!

508
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:27,521
Rhea was right.
- What?

509
00:54:28,721 --> 00:54:31,121
You're a stubborn girl.
Very stubborn

510
00:54:31,721 --> 00:54:34,721
Is that what she said about me?
I'll set her right!

511
00:54:39,721 --> 00:54:42,121
She was right too.
- Not at all!

512
00:54:59,721 --> 00:55:02,121
Rahul, you won't tell grandpa,
will you?

513
00:55:10,721 --> 00:55:12,281
Okay, I won't tell him

514
00:55:13,721 --> 00:55:16,121
But I have a condition.
- What?

515
00:56:00,721 --> 00:56:03,721
We were looking for a bride
all these days, and here she was

516
00:56:05,721 --> 00:56:08,720
I did that only to stop you
from telling grandpa anything

517
00:56:08,721 --> 00:56:11,720
I wouldn't have told grandpa anything
even if you hadn't done this for me

518
00:56:11,721 --> 00:56:14,720
Because your friends' secrets,
are not to be told to anyone

519
00:56:14,721 --> 00:56:17,721
Are you my friend then?
- Are you feeling sorry then?

520
00:56:38,721 --> 00:56:41,721
Is everything all right?
- Today's a full-moon night

521
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:07,721
Rahul, I forgot. We're leaving
for Mussourie at 6 tomorrow morning

522
00:57:09,721 --> 00:57:12,721
Yes, Anna has organised everything
to shoot the music video there

523
00:57:33,721 --> 00:57:35,521
What's up?
- Nothing's right

524
00:57:42,721 --> 00:57:43,681
I quit

525
00:57:44,721 --> 00:57:47,721
Hero and heroine. They're missing.
- The heroine has made it on tv

526
00:57:48,721 --> 00:57:51,721
Landed a double role, playing
daughter-in-law and mother-in-law

527
00:57:52,721 --> 00:57:55,121
And hero?
- Gone too. And now me too

528
00:57:55,721 --> 00:57:58,721
Anna, do something!
- Do what? Every other model is booked

529
00:58:01,721 --> 00:58:04,121
But we're still shooting.
- How?

530
00:58:04,721 --> 00:58:07,721
Just found myself my hero-heroine.
- Really? Who?

531
00:58:18,721 --> 00:58:19,681
Us...?

532
00:58:30,721 --> 00:58:33,721
Madam, don't do an Adam! You're
replacing the heroine, not the hero

533
00:58:46,721 --> 00:58:48,521
Madam! It's a dance! Romance

534
00:58:48,721 --> 00:58:49,921
Not action

535
00:59:14,721 --> 00:59:17,721
What's going on?
How can anyone shoot like this?

536
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:19,681
I quit

537
00:59:25,721 --> 00:59:26,921
In tears?

538
00:59:29,721 --> 00:59:32,121
Crying? Over a dance?
- Not about the dance

539
00:59:33,721 --> 00:59:35,281
Then...?
- My feet

540
00:59:36,721 --> 00:59:39,721
Everyone was laughing about my feet.
- Feet...?

541
00:59:41,721 --> 00:59:44,121
You don't know! I know!
I got clod feet

542
00:59:46,721 --> 00:59:49,121
Everyone laughed about my feet.
And you too

543
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:54,121
I don't think anyone even noticed
your feet

544
01:00:04,721 --> 01:00:07,721
Not clod, just a bit different.
- I'm so full of defects

545
01:00:12,721 --> 01:00:15,720
Everyone has defects.
- And I got one too many

546
01:00:15,721 --> 01:00:17,521
I got a lot of defects too

547
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:26,521
Isn't your nose a bit too long?

548
01:00:32,721 --> 01:00:33,681
Nose?

549
01:00:36,721 --> 01:00:37,681
Mine?

550
01:00:42,721 --> 01:00:44,521
And your ears. Just like a monkey

551
01:00:48,721 --> 01:00:51,721
And your haircut. Oh-so-common.
- One minute. Everyone says...

552
01:00:52,721 --> 01:00:55,721
this haircut looks perfect on me.
- They say it to please you

553
01:00:56,721 --> 01:00:59,721
Take your lips.
- One minute. Long nose, monkey-ears

554
01:01:00,721 --> 01:01:03,720
Haircut, oh-so-common.
And my lips aren't nice either?

555
01:01:03,721 --> 01:01:06,121
Your chin is crooked too.
- Crooked chin?

556
01:01:09,721 --> 01:01:12,121
Your eyes...
- Squint? Or cross? Or toady?

557
01:01:15,721 --> 01:01:16,921
Your eyes...

558
01:01:18,721 --> 01:01:19,921
are so nice

559
01:01:20,721 --> 01:01:21,921
Just like you

560
01:01:48,721 --> 01:01:50,281
* I come to you...

561
01:01:54,721 --> 01:01:56,281
* holding my heart

562
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,281
* I come to you...

563
01:02:09,721 --> 01:02:11,281
* holding my heart

564
01:02:20,721 --> 01:02:22,521
* Come on, if you want to come

565
01:02:24,721 --> 01:02:25,720
* I want to

566
01:02:25,721 --> 01:02:27,521
* There's no going back for me

567
01:02:29,721 --> 01:02:31,281
* No going back?

568
01:02:31,721 --> 01:02:34,721
* But keeping this promise
* is going to be tough

569
01:02:36,721 --> 01:02:38,521
* Think it over, my friend

570
01:03:16,721 --> 01:03:18,521
* If the going is like this,

571
01:03:21,721 --> 01:03:23,521
* I'm going to end up crazy

572
01:03:31,721 --> 01:03:33,521
* If the going is like this,

573
01:03:37,721 --> 01:03:39,521
* I'm going to end up crazy

574
01:03:42,721 --> 01:03:45,721
* Let's lose ourselves in each other
* no one will ever find us

575
01:03:54,721 --> 01:03:56,521
* I've said what I wanted to say

576
01:03:59,721 --> 01:04:01,521
* I've heard what I wanted to hear

577
01:04:04,721 --> 01:04:06,521
* Come on, if you're coming

578
01:04:08,721 --> 01:04:09,921
* I'm coming

579
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:12,281
* No going back for me

580
01:04:13,721 --> 01:04:15,281
* No going back!

581
01:04:15,721 --> 01:04:18,121
* Keeping this promise
* is going to be tough

582
01:04:20,721 --> 01:04:22,521
* Think it over, my friend

583
01:04:26,721 --> 01:04:28,281
* I come to you...

584
01:04:32,721 --> 01:04:34,281
* holding my heart

585
01:05:30,721 --> 01:05:32,281
* Touch my veil

586
01:05:35,721 --> 01:05:37,281
* Become my lover

587
01:05:45,721 --> 01:05:47,281
* Touch my veil

588
01:05:50,721 --> 01:05:52,281
* Become my lover

589
01:05:56,721 --> 01:05:58,281
* Sit before me

590
01:06:01,721 --> 01:06:03,521
* Let me hold you in my heart

591
01:06:08,721 --> 01:06:10,281
* I've had all I wanted

592
01:06:13,721 --> 01:06:15,521
* I've lived and I've died

593
01:06:19,721 --> 01:06:21,521
* Come on, if you want to come

594
01:06:22,721 --> 01:06:23,921
* I want to

595
01:06:24,721 --> 01:06:26,521
* There's no going back for me

596
01:06:27,721 --> 01:06:29,281
* No going back?

597
01:06:29,721 --> 01:06:32,721
* But keeping this promise
* is going to be tough

598
01:06:34,721 --> 01:06:36,521
* Think it over, my friend

599
01:06:40,721 --> 01:06:42,521
* Think it over, my friend

600
01:06:54,721 --> 01:06:55,921
Wonderful

601
01:07:00,721 --> 01:07:03,121
The day Esha won her first trophy,
I was glad

602
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:08,121
The day Esha topped her school,
I was glad

603
01:07:09,721 --> 01:07:12,721
But today, I haven't words enough
to describe my joys

604
01:07:15,721 --> 01:07:18,721
Esha, ever since you were a child,
you gave me much to be happy about

605
01:07:21,721 --> 01:07:24,721
One after another, you always
gave me something to smile about

606
01:07:48,721 --> 01:07:51,121
Found this letter for you
at the post office

607
01:07:53,721 --> 01:07:56,721
Why do I feel you're always close
to me? Is it because I'm in town?

608
01:08:04,721 --> 01:08:07,121
I'm not going to try
looking you up

609
01:08:10,721 --> 01:08:13,721
But if you feel like seeing me,
just look over your shoulder

610
01:08:15,721 --> 01:08:17,521
You'll find me right ahead

611
01:08:24,721 --> 01:08:25,921
What...?

612
01:08:26,721 --> 01:08:28,281
What happened?

613
01:08:28,721 --> 01:08:30,521
Grandpa wants to see you

614
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:48,121
There was girl
and her parents doted on her

615
01:08:51,721 --> 01:08:54,721
Her laughter and the chime
of her anklets filled their house

616
01:08:57,721 --> 01:09:00,721
Then one day, she got married and
she had to leave with her husband

617
01:09:04,721 --> 01:09:07,721
She had tears in her eyes
when she asked her father...

618
01:09:08,721 --> 01:09:11,721
why she was being sent away.
Didn't her father love her anymore?

619
01:09:15,721 --> 01:09:19,321
Her father choked on his tears when
he said, not today, he'd reply later

620
01:09:27,721 --> 01:09:30,121
Years later, there she was,
happy at her home

621
01:09:32,721 --> 01:09:35,721
And her father arrives and he says,
how much he misses her

622
01:09:41,721 --> 01:09:44,721
He pleaded, come home with me.
And his daughter said...

623
01:09:45,721 --> 01:09:48,721
how can I leave my home?
Won't my husband miss me?

624
01:09:51,721 --> 01:09:54,121
And who will take care
of my home?

625
01:09:57,721 --> 01:10:00,721
Here father laughs and says,
there, you got your answer

626
01:10:06,721 --> 01:10:09,721
That was just as well, because
I would've missed her sorely

627
01:10:12,721 --> 01:10:13,921
Grannie

628
01:10:17,721 --> 01:10:19,281
Yes, your grandmother

629
01:10:22,721 --> 01:10:25,721
Some day, every girl must cross
that threshold, she must leave...

630
01:10:28,721 --> 01:10:31,121
to make for herself
a beautiful world...

631
01:10:34,721 --> 01:10:37,121
among those to whom she belongs...

632
01:10:37,721 --> 01:10:39,281
ones who will miss her

633
01:10:44,721 --> 01:10:47,721
Esha, I've found a boy for you.
He's known to us

634
01:10:50,721 --> 01:10:53,121
Aunt Maya's friend's son.
Very nice family

635
01:10:55,721 --> 01:10:58,121
And best of all,
in their family...

636
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:01,721
you will be more a daughter
than a daughter-in-law

637
01:11:02,721 --> 01:11:05,121
That's how dearly
they will love you

638
01:11:12,721 --> 01:11:15,721
I hope you didn't tell him anything?
- No, but I think I must

639
01:11:16,721 --> 01:11:19,721
Not a word to Grandpa!
- I must! He's considering marriage

640
01:11:21,721 --> 01:11:24,721
Then say that you aren't marrying
some stranger

641
01:11:25,721 --> 01:11:28,721
Aunt Maya's friend's son!
- But you never met him

642
01:11:30,721 --> 01:11:33,721
Aunt Maya has, and she approves!
- Who's marrying? You or Aunt Maya?

643
01:11:35,721 --> 01:11:38,721
Rhea, I don't want to marry.
I can't even think of anyone else

644
01:11:41,721 --> 01:11:44,721
He's the only one I'm in love with.
And I'm telling Grandpa

645
01:11:46,721 --> 01:11:49,721
Tell him what? About post box 143?
- Then what am I to do?

646
01:11:51,721 --> 01:11:55,321
Enlist Rahul's help. He's from Bombay.
He could find out something, at least

647
01:11:57,721 --> 01:12:00,721
Once Rahul has found out about him,
you can tell Grandpa everything

648
01:12:04,721 --> 01:12:07,721
But can I trust Rahul so much?
- You trust someone you've never seen

649
01:12:10,721 --> 01:12:13,721
And after all these years,
are you suspicious of Rahul?

650
01:12:27,721 --> 01:12:30,721
Answering machine speaking.
Drop your message after the beep

651
01:12:37,721 --> 01:12:40,721
Ma said, you approve of my match with
Esha. But do I approve of her?

652
01:12:43,721 --> 01:12:46,121
Yes, I sent you over
to look up Esha

653
01:12:47,721 --> 01:12:50,721
And I even said I'd marry her
if you happen to approve of her

654
01:12:54,721 --> 01:12:56,720
The thought of marriage
is driving me nuts

655
01:12:56,721 --> 01:12:59,721
For a lifetime, can I possibly
be in love with this one girl?

656
01:13:02,721 --> 01:13:05,121
Anyway, if you say Esha
is the one...

657
01:13:08,721 --> 01:13:10,281
Hey, call me up

658
01:13:58,721 --> 01:14:00,281
You came to find out...

659
01:14:00,721 --> 01:14:03,720
how much Esha Malhotra scores
on the eligibility grades?

660
01:14:03,721 --> 01:14:06,721
You were marking me all this time,
sizing me up for your friend?

661
01:14:11,721 --> 01:14:15,321
So you approve? Is that why you wanted
to strike up a friendship with me?

662
01:14:16,721 --> 01:14:19,721
I can't make you out anymore.
Are you what you came across as?

663
01:14:23,721 --> 01:14:26,721
Or are you what I see now? But
at least I know, you're no friend

664
01:14:39,721 --> 01:14:42,720
How can I marry your friend?
- She is Maya's niece

665
01:14:42,721 --> 01:14:46,321
Whatever she is, I can't marry her.
- Will we ever find such a nice girl?

666
01:14:47,721 --> 01:14:49,281
She must be nice

667
01:14:51,721 --> 01:14:53,281
Then get to know her

668
01:14:54,721 --> 01:14:55,921
She's Esha

669
01:14:58,721 --> 01:15:00,281
Innocent and lovable

670
01:15:03,721 --> 01:15:05,720
Smile's cute too.
Also, nice voice

671
01:15:05,721 --> 01:15:07,521
Made it all out from the photo?

672
01:15:07,721 --> 01:15:10,720
Even heard her voice? Strange!
- Talked to her over the phone

673
01:15:10,721 --> 01:15:13,121
Wants a photographer
for her fashion magazine

674
01:15:13,721 --> 01:15:14,921
You like her?

675
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:19,721
In my place, what'd you do?
- Say yes, what else?

676
01:15:22,721 --> 01:15:25,720
Now you're in my place.
Ma, Rahul approves of her

677
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:27,281
Get him married. Fast

678
01:15:30,721 --> 01:15:32,281
I got to know her

679
01:15:32,721 --> 01:15:35,721
Maybe take a holiday with her,
some sunsets, sunrises together

680
01:15:36,721 --> 01:15:39,721
Until then, how will I know
whether I want to marry her?

681
01:15:45,721 --> 01:15:48,721
A little carelessness can wreck
a wonderful friendship

682
01:15:49,721 --> 01:15:52,721
They won't approve of a courtship.
- The let Rahul look her up

683
01:15:53,721 --> 01:15:55,720
Why me?
- If Rahul approves of her...

684
01:15:55,721 --> 01:15:58,720
I'm willing to marry.
- Why me? I'm going nowhere

685
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:00,521
You're the one who's invited

686
01:16:01,721 --> 01:16:04,721
Look Rahul, I don't even know
what kind of girl I want

687
01:16:05,721 --> 01:16:08,720
As for you, you always know
exactly what's right

688
01:16:08,721 --> 01:16:11,721
You know me through and through.
So why don't you decide?

689
01:16:13,721 --> 01:16:16,121
Is she the one
I'll fall in love with?

690
01:16:18,721 --> 01:16:21,121
If I approve, you will agree?
- Yes

691
01:16:24,721 --> 01:16:27,121
You aren't lying?
- I only lie to girls

692
01:16:28,721 --> 01:16:31,121
Akshay, this is no joke.
- I know. That's why

693
01:16:39,721 --> 01:16:41,521
Hi! I'm Rahul. Rahul Sharma

694
01:16:42,721 --> 01:16:44,521
I called to say,
I'm available

695
01:16:51,721 --> 01:16:54,121
How long have you known him?
- Quite long

696
01:16:56,721 --> 01:16:59,721
And you're telling me now?
- I wanted to get to know him

697
01:17:02,721 --> 01:17:05,121
So you've gotten to know him?
- Yes

698
01:17:08,721 --> 01:17:11,121
How many times have you met?
- Not once

699
01:17:12,721 --> 01:17:15,121
What does he do?
- I don't know

700
01:17:17,721 --> 01:17:20,121
Where does he live?
- I don't know

701
01:17:20,721 --> 01:17:23,121
His name? A family?
- I don't know

702
01:17:26,721 --> 01:17:28,521
Then what do you know about him?

703
01:17:32,721 --> 01:17:35,721
That I can trust him.
- Someone you've never even met?

704
01:17:42,721 --> 01:17:45,721
A trust is given, not seen.
It comes from the heart

705
01:17:49,721 --> 01:17:52,721
I just got to shut my eyes and
think about him and I believe him

706
01:17:56,721 --> 01:17:58,521
Please meet him, for once Grandpa

707
01:17:59,721 --> 01:18:02,721
Dearest, I don't think we'll have
to write letters any longer

708
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:07,721
I want to see you.
I told my grandfather all about you

709
01:18:10,721 --> 01:18:13,721
He wants to meet the person
I've chosen for myself'

710
01:18:14,721 --> 01:18:17,121
28th July, 4 pm.
DehraDun Boat Club

711
01:18:18,721 --> 01:18:21,121
My grandfather and I will
be expecting you

712
01:18:21,721 --> 01:18:22,921
Yours, Esha

713
01:19:16,721 --> 01:19:19,721
After so long! How come
I don't know you're coming?

714
01:19:22,721 --> 01:19:25,121
We went home and we found out
you're here

715
01:19:25,721 --> 01:19:28,720
And I thought, why delay
introductions? So here we are

716
01:19:28,721 --> 01:19:31,721
Dug out the your childhood friend?
- We can't live without each other

717
01:19:34,721 --> 01:19:37,720
She's the one who deserted me
and made off for Australia

718
01:19:37,721 --> 01:19:40,721
How long could she stand you?
Not everyone is like me

719
01:19:45,721 --> 01:19:48,721
Can you make him out?
The same roly-poly fat boy

720
01:19:52,721 --> 01:19:53,681
Akshay

721
01:19:55,721 --> 01:19:58,121
And this is Grandpa's apple of the eye.
Esha

722
01:21:09,721 --> 01:21:12,720
Is Esha the girl
you'd give up everything for?

723
01:21:12,721 --> 01:21:13,681
Yes

724
01:21:16,721 --> 01:21:19,121
Why?
- Because she's just like you

725
01:21:22,721 --> 01:21:25,121
Am I going to end up with
someone like you?

726
01:21:29,721 --> 01:21:32,121
We ought to get married
on the same day

727
01:21:34,721 --> 01:21:36,521
But not to the same girl

728
01:21:40,721 --> 01:21:43,721
Were it not for you, I'd never
have found out what love is like

729
01:21:47,721 --> 01:21:50,121
And I'd go through life
without love

730
01:21:51,721 --> 01:21:53,281
You mean so much to me

731
01:21:54,721 --> 01:21:56,281
You're a brother

732
01:21:56,721 --> 01:21:57,921
A friend

733
01:22:24,721 --> 01:22:26,521
Aunt Maya said, they approve

734
01:22:30,721 --> 01:22:33,721
Akshay is a very nice boy.
We've known the family for ages

735
01:22:36,721 --> 01:22:39,721
Esha, I think you should consider him.
- But Grandpa...

736
01:22:41,721 --> 01:22:43,521
maybe he never got my letter

737
01:22:47,721 --> 01:22:49,521
Esha, I approve of Akshay too

738
01:22:51,721 --> 01:22:54,121
What do you want?
- To see you happy

739
01:23:57,721 --> 01:24:00,721
Rahul is like a son to me.
Akshay and Rahul are childhood friends

740
01:24:02,721 --> 01:24:05,721
We've known Rahul for quite sometime,
but we never knew he's family

741
01:24:11,721 --> 01:24:13,281
This one.
- Oh no

742
01:24:13,721 --> 01:24:16,121
But you must,
this is part of the ritual

743
01:24:24,721 --> 01:24:27,721
For you. We'd like to see you
wearing this for the engagement

744
01:24:29,721 --> 01:24:32,721
I think you'll look gorgeous.
I'm keeping it here

745
01:24:35,721 --> 01:24:38,721
Everyone is waiting outside. For you.
Akshay is here too

746
01:24:40,721 --> 01:24:43,721
I've never seen him so glad.
He wants to get married right away

747
01:24:51,721 --> 01:24:54,721
I never came to size you up, Esha.
I just wanted to find out...

748
01:24:57,721 --> 01:25:00,721
whether you're the girl whom Akshay
would care for, all his life...

749
01:25:02,721 --> 01:25:05,721
whether you're the girl who'd evoke
anyone's feelings

750
01:25:08,721 --> 01:25:11,721
And you are that girl, Esha.
I didn't mean to hurt you

751
01:25:20,721 --> 01:25:22,281
Trust me, Esha

752
01:25:28,721 --> 01:25:30,521
Why should I trust you, Rahul?

753
01:25:34,721 --> 01:25:37,121
Look at me, could I ever lie to you?

754
01:25:44,721 --> 01:25:45,921
6 months?

755
01:25:46,721 --> 01:25:48,281
No, he's the astrologer

756
01:25:51,721 --> 01:25:54,721
How can some astrologer decide
when I get married?

757
01:25:55,721 --> 01:25:58,721
But there are no auspicious dates.
- Then I stay here for 6 months

758
01:26:02,721 --> 01:26:05,721
When I didn't want to get married,
you were after me. Now I'm willing

759
01:26:07,721 --> 01:26:09,720
Why are you taking so long?
- Not so soon.

760
01:26:09,721 --> 01:26:12,721
No one will be able to make it from
Bombay. How about an engagement?

761
01:26:13,721 --> 01:26:14,921
Engagement?

762
01:26:16,721 --> 01:26:19,721
I'm here, Esha is here.
Rahul is here, you're here

763
01:26:21,721 --> 01:26:24,121
Who needs anyone else?
- As you wish

764
01:26:25,721 --> 01:26:28,720
We'll talk to Maya right away.
- The talks are over

765
01:26:28,721 --> 01:26:30,281
Now, engagement

766
01:26:39,721 --> 01:26:41,521
Where's Esha?
- Over there

767
01:26:55,721 --> 01:26:58,721
He never received your letter.
He wants to see you. Today

768
01:27:01,721 --> 01:27:04,121
No word from you in quite some time?

769
01:27:04,721 --> 01:27:07,721
I wondered, if providence
has drawn us close, we must meet

770
01:27:08,721 --> 01:27:11,721
But this is taking too much time.
I can't wait any longer

771
01:27:13,721 --> 01:27:15,720
Whenever I shut my eyes
I can see you

772
01:27:15,721 --> 01:27:17,521
I open my eyes
and you're lost

773
01:27:19,721 --> 01:27:22,121
I hope I don't lose you
before we have met

774
01:27:24,721 --> 01:27:26,521
I want to see you.
August 10

775
01:27:27,721 --> 01:27:30,121
8 pm. At the Ram Temple.
I'll carry the doll

776
01:27:33,721 --> 01:27:35,521
You carry the plane
I sent you

777
01:27:35,721 --> 01:27:37,281
Will you come?

778
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:36,121
* Your beloved stands
* at your doorstep...

779
01:31:37,721 --> 01:31:39,281
* he brings love

780
01:31:41,721 --> 01:31:44,121
* Your beloved stands
* at your doorstep...

781
01:31:44,721 --> 01:31:46,281
* he brings love

782
01:31:47,721 --> 01:31:50,121
* Your beloved stands
* at your doorstep...

783
01:31:52,721 --> 01:31:54,281
* he brings love

784
01:31:56,721 --> 01:31:58,720
* Your beloved stands
* at your doorstep...

785
01:31:58,721 --> 01:32:00,281
* he brings love

786
01:32:03,721 --> 01:32:06,121
* He says, don't wait,
* come with me...

787
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:09,121
* He says, don't wait,
* come with me...

788
01:32:09,721 --> 01:32:11,281
* we're losing our years

789
01:32:12,721 --> 01:32:15,121
* Your beloved stands
* at your doorstep...

790
01:32:15,721 --> 01:32:17,281
* he brings love

791
01:32:18,721 --> 01:32:21,121
* Your beloved stands
* at your doorstep...

792
01:32:22,721 --> 01:32:24,281
* he brings love

793
01:32:58,721 --> 01:33:01,721
* Let's make love first,
* you can act coy afterwards

794
01:33:09,721 --> 01:33:12,721
* Let's make love first,
* you can act coy afterwards

795
01:33:16,721 --> 01:33:19,721
* Give me my moments of joy, you'll
* still have the rest of my life...

796
01:33:20,721 --> 01:33:22,281
* to make me miserable.

797
01:33:25,721 --> 01:33:28,121
* What kind of a lover will you make?

798
01:33:28,721 --> 01:33:31,121
* Are you naive?
* Are you crazy?

799
01:33:32,721 --> 01:33:35,121
* Lightning sears
* through my heart

800
01:33:36,721 --> 01:33:39,121
* Lightning sears
* through my heart

801
01:33:40,721 --> 01:33:43,121
* Your beloved stands
* at your doorstep...

802
01:33:43,721 --> 01:33:45,281
* he brings love

803
01:33:47,721 --> 01:33:50,121
* Your beloved stands
* at your doorstep...

804
01:33:51,721 --> 01:33:53,281
* he brings love

805
01:34:24,721 --> 01:34:26,281
* The bride is yours

806
01:34:27,721 --> 01:34:29,281
* The bride is yours

807
01:34:30,721 --> 01:34:32,281
* The bride is yours

808
01:34:34,721 --> 01:34:36,281
* The bride is yours

809
01:35:18,087 --> 01:35:21,087
The girl presents the ring to the boy?
- Right

810
01:35:23,087 --> 01:35:24,047
Son...

811
01:35:37,087 --> 01:35:38,287
One minute

812
01:35:40,087 --> 01:35:42,487
I'd like a word with Esha
in private

813
01:35:43,087 --> 01:35:46,087
What is the matter?
- I'd like to ask her something

814
01:35:50,087 --> 01:35:53,687
I always thought, girls are two kinds.
Those we romance and the one you marry

815
01:36:08,087 --> 01:36:11,087
For me, you're the only girl
I could romance and marry too

816
01:36:20,087 --> 01:36:23,087
I've had girls. But for the first time
I feel love

817
01:36:29,087 --> 01:36:32,087
Maybe, you too have a past?
Someone you have loved?

818
01:36:36,087 --> 01:36:39,087
But I don't care to know about him.
All I know is...

819
01:36:40,087 --> 01:36:42,487
we got a lifetime ahead. Together.

820
01:36:47,087 --> 01:36:48,887
Esha, will you marry me?

821
01:38:28,087 --> 01:38:29,647
Hurry, there's the car

822
01:38:33,087 --> 01:38:36,087
This astrologer is something else.
Finds a date ages away

823
01:38:39,087 --> 01:38:41,487
If you say so, I could stay back,
a while...?

824
01:38:43,087 --> 01:38:46,087
We could chat over phone. No problems
at your end...? Shouldn't be

825
01:38:48,087 --> 01:38:50,086
I think Grandpa is suitably
impressed with me

826
01:38:50,087 --> 01:38:52,487
But one problem. I don't know
how you find me

827
01:38:57,087 --> 01:38:58,887
Trust me, I'm not that bad

828
01:39:01,087 --> 01:39:04,687
Akshay, why are you doing all this?
I haven't said yes about marrying you

829
01:39:11,087 --> 01:39:12,647
Neither did you say no

830
01:39:43,087 --> 01:39:44,047
Yes?

831
01:39:49,087 --> 01:39:51,487
See what's happened to me.
- What's happened?

832
01:39:52,087 --> 01:39:54,487
Take a good look.
- Sure, so what?

833
01:39:55,087 --> 01:39:57,487
I'm looking like an ass.
- Same as always

834
01:39:59,087 --> 01:40:00,647
Only more stupid

835
01:40:05,087 --> 01:40:08,087
I'm looking like a monkey.
Get me some clothes. I haven't any

836
01:40:10,087 --> 01:40:13,087
Been in that all your life?
- You don't get me

837
01:40:17,087 --> 01:40:20,087
What would wear when you're going
to date your favourite girlfriend?

838
01:40:28,087 --> 01:40:30,487
What she'd like, obviously.
- Like...?

839
01:40:31,087 --> 01:40:33,487
Well, she likes just about
whatever I wear

840
01:40:48,087 --> 01:40:51,087
You saved me! I was about
to wear the colours of spring

841
01:40:52,087 --> 01:40:54,487
But where are you going?
- To see Esha

842
01:40:57,087 --> 01:40:58,887
She's arriving in Bombay

843
01:41:00,087 --> 01:41:03,087
I never slept all night. What to say,
never been in love before

844
01:41:10,087 --> 01:41:11,647
I'm getting sentimental

845
01:41:53,087 --> 01:41:54,647
Let me introduce you

846
01:41:55,087 --> 01:41:56,887
Introducing the whole lineage

847
01:42:01,087 --> 01:42:02,647
What do I tell her?

848
01:42:51,087 --> 01:42:54,087
I've managed the introductions.
Upto you to strike a friendship

849
01:42:57,087 --> 01:43:00,087
Rahul lost his mother at three.
His father migrated to Canada

850
01:43:01,087 --> 01:43:04,087
Left him with the grandparents.
- Why didn't he take Rahul along?

851
01:43:06,087 --> 01:43:09,087
Rahul reminded him about his mother.
Then he asked Rahul to migrate

852
01:43:12,087 --> 01:43:14,487
But Rahul couldn't bear to leave me

853
01:43:16,087 --> 01:43:19,087
Doesn't seem as if he hides
a sorrow behind that smile, does he?

854
01:43:20,087 --> 01:43:23,087
He's always making people laugh.
- That's my Rahul

855
01:43:24,087 --> 01:43:27,087
Akshay and Rahul grew up together.
They're inseparable

856
01:43:38,087 --> 01:43:40,487
For each other,
they'll do anything

857
01:43:41,087 --> 01:43:44,087
What a friendship!
They never needed another friend

858
01:44:06,087 --> 01:44:07,887
Their likings are similar too

859
01:44:08,087 --> 01:44:11,087
They love each other so much,
they're inseparable

860
01:44:36,087 --> 01:44:39,087
I worry for Rahul. He never
makes his feelings obvious

861
01:44:41,087 --> 01:44:44,087
Akshay demands whatever he wants.
But Rahul...

862
01:44:45,087 --> 01:44:47,487
will even forego
what he's entitled to

863
01:45:03,087 --> 01:45:06,087
Only 3 things for a happy life.
Nice food, nice cars and nice women

864
01:45:27,087 --> 01:45:30,087
My birthday, isn't today.
- Hardly matters. For me, it's today

865
01:45:35,087 --> 01:45:38,087
I've missed the whole lot of them,
let me make up for all of them

866
01:46:10,087 --> 01:46:11,287
So much food?

867
01:46:13,087 --> 01:46:14,647
That's one huge...

868
01:46:16,087 --> 01:46:17,887
Fish?
- Pick of the trawlers

869
01:46:23,087 --> 01:46:24,887
The flower is for fragrance

870
01:46:26,087 --> 01:46:29,087
Do you expect me to start?
No Indian-woman tripe

871
01:46:35,087 --> 01:46:37,487
I'm a vegetarian.
I don't eat non-veg

872
01:46:54,087 --> 01:46:57,087
Hadn't an inkling you're a vegetarian.
You never eat non-veg?

873
01:47:01,087 --> 01:47:04,087
Suppose your lover asks you
to eat non-veg, what would you do?

874
01:47:07,087 --> 01:47:10,087
If he loves me, he'll never say that.
- Welcome sir

875
01:47:11,087 --> 01:47:13,487
You never try to change
someone you love

876
01:47:27,087 --> 01:47:30,087
Akshay, why do you want to marry me?
- What a question

877
01:47:31,087 --> 01:47:32,887
Anyone would want to marry you

878
01:47:37,087 --> 01:47:39,487
For marrying me,
so much is enough?

879
01:47:49,087 --> 01:47:50,647
It was love...

880
01:47:52,087 --> 01:47:53,647
at first sight

881
01:47:58,087 --> 01:47:59,887
So it's my features that you love

882
01:48:04,087 --> 01:48:05,887
Once I'm fat, you won't like me

883
01:48:09,087 --> 01:48:12,087
That'd be the end of your love?
- How fat...? Won't happen

884
01:48:14,087 --> 01:48:17,087
No dearth of health clubs
and beauty parlours in Bombay

885
01:48:26,087 --> 01:48:29,087
You don't even know me,
we haven't even had a conversation

886
01:48:31,087 --> 01:48:34,087
How do you know you'd like to spend
the rest of your life with me?

887
01:48:37,087 --> 01:48:40,087
My heart tells me, you're the one.
- If you could trust your heart...

888
01:48:44,087 --> 01:48:46,487
why did you send Rahul
to size me up?

889
01:48:49,087 --> 01:48:52,086
When Tina was angry,
I gave her a diamond bracelet

890
01:48:52,087 --> 01:48:54,487
When Rupali was cross,
I sent her flowers

891
01:48:55,087 --> 01:48:56,887
But how do I woo Esha? Beats me

892
01:49:00,087 --> 01:49:03,087
I sent you to look her up,
that was my only fault

893
01:49:08,087 --> 01:49:11,086
One thing she didn't know?
- I was about to tell her

894
01:49:11,087 --> 01:49:13,487
A few kids later,
I'd tell her, no?

895
01:49:18,087 --> 01:49:19,287
What do I do?

896
01:49:23,087 --> 01:49:26,087
This once, I can say nothing.
- Should I ask the girl in black?

897
01:49:37,087 --> 01:49:40,087
Akshay, if you really are in love,
put the question to yourself'

898
01:50:11,087 --> 01:50:14,087
Yes, we're at the hotel.
Yes Pratap, all of us

899
01:50:17,087 --> 01:50:20,087
Pratap is an old friend of his.
All our friends are coming

900
01:50:21,087 --> 01:50:23,086
Everyone wants to meet Esha.
Where is Esha?

901
01:50:23,087 --> 01:50:26,087
Should be coming. She was nervous
about meeting so many people

902
01:50:28,087 --> 01:50:30,086
And Maya?
- Went to the beauty parlour

903
01:50:30,087 --> 01:50:33,087
She'll come to the party directly.
- Yes Pratap, coming in

904
01:50:35,087 --> 01:50:38,087
Dad, why don't you go on?
- But Esha is expected

905
01:50:39,087 --> 01:50:40,887
Rahul and I will receive her

906
01:50:42,087 --> 01:50:43,287
Let's go in

907
01:50:48,087 --> 01:50:51,087
How sweet of Uncle Pratap
to throw a party for you and Esha

908
01:50:52,087 --> 01:50:55,086
I hope Esha likes the dress
I took from that model

909
01:50:55,087 --> 01:50:58,087
I even asked the model what her
favourite perfume is. One second...

910
01:51:00,087 --> 01:51:01,887
What's up?
- I'm dead

911
01:51:21,087 --> 01:51:22,287
Another...?

912
01:51:24,087 --> 01:51:25,887
If Esha sees me with them...

913
01:51:28,087 --> 01:51:29,887
I'm done for! Are you laughing?

914
01:51:30,087 --> 01:51:31,287
I'm off

915
01:51:32,087 --> 01:51:35,087
Tell Esha, something urgent came up.
Please, handle this

916
01:52:27,087 --> 01:52:28,287
* God...

917
01:52:32,087 --> 01:52:33,647
* show me money

918
01:52:45,087 --> 01:52:48,086
The next song will be played
on the request of Pappu, Anupam...

919
01:52:48,087 --> 01:52:49,647
Aditya, Uday and Akash.

920
01:53:09,087 --> 01:53:10,647
* Is this love?

921
01:53:14,087 --> 01:53:15,647
* Yes, this is love

922
01:53:18,087 --> 01:53:20,487
* Without you, nothing amuses me...

923
01:53:23,087 --> 01:53:24,647
* time doesn't pass

924
01:53:27,087 --> 01:53:28,647
* Is this love?

925
01:53:30,087 --> 01:53:31,047
* Yes

926
01:53:32,087 --> 01:53:33,647
* Yes, this is love

927
01:53:37,087 --> 01:53:39,487
* Without you, nothing amuses me...

928
01:53:42,087 --> 01:53:43,647
* time doesn't pass

929
01:54:02,087 --> 01:54:05,087
Let me tell you something, dude.
Your girlfriend is drop-dead gorgeous

930
01:54:06,087 --> 01:54:08,487
Look...
- Isn't she your girlfriend?

931
01:54:10,087 --> 01:54:11,647
Rahul, let's go.

932
01:54:14,087 --> 01:54:15,887
Well tell me, what's her price?

933
01:54:20,087 --> 01:54:23,086
Leave her for me after you're through.
- Damn you!

934
01:54:23,087 --> 01:54:26,087
No use, Rahul. Let's go, please.
People are waiting for us. Please!

935
01:54:33,087 --> 01:54:34,887
Hey man, no hard feelings.

936
01:55:57,087 --> 01:55:58,887
I wish to give you a good news.

937
01:56:01,087 --> 01:56:04,087
Akshay, my very old friend's son,
is engaged to Esha.

938
01:56:05,087 --> 01:56:08,087
She's the daughter of DehraDun's
famous businessman, Inder Malhotra.

939
01:56:11,087 --> 01:56:14,087
I want all of you to warmly welcome
our new family member.

940
01:56:17,087 --> 01:56:20,087
Now, Akshay and Esha
will begin tonight's dance.

941
01:58:22,087 --> 01:58:23,287
* Why did I...

942
01:58:26,087 --> 01:58:27,647
* fall in love with you?

943
01:58:33,087 --> 01:58:34,647
* I didn't find you

944
01:58:37,087 --> 01:58:38,287
* Now I'm lost

945
01:58:43,087 --> 01:58:45,487
* You never walked out of my dreams

946
01:58:49,087 --> 01:58:51,487
* Neither did you walk into my arms

947
01:59:16,087 --> 01:59:17,287
* Why did I...

948
01:59:20,087 --> 01:59:21,647
* fall in love with you?

949
01:59:27,087 --> 01:59:28,647
* I didn't find you

950
01:59:31,087 --> 01:59:32,287
* Now I'm lost

951
01:59:38,087 --> 01:59:39,887
* You still linger in my dreams

952
01:59:43,087 --> 01:59:44,887
* But I never had you in my arms

953
02:00:21,087 --> 02:00:22,887
* I have no complaints against you

954
02:00:26,087 --> 02:00:27,647
* I rue my fate

955
02:00:31,087 --> 02:00:32,647
* Why does heaven...

956
02:00:37,087 --> 02:00:38,887
* decide the fate of hearts?

957
02:00:53,087 --> 02:00:55,487
* You never walked out of my dreams

958
02:00:58,087 --> 02:01:00,487
* Neither did you walk into my arms

959
02:01:26,087 --> 02:01:27,287
* Why did I...

960
02:01:30,087 --> 02:01:31,647
* fall in love with you?

961
02:01:36,087 --> 02:01:37,647
* I didn't find you...

962
02:01:40,087 --> 02:01:41,287
* now I'm lost

963
02:02:09,087 --> 02:02:10,647
* Why I am ruined...

964
02:02:14,087 --> 02:02:15,647
* I could never tell

965
02:02:20,087 --> 02:02:21,647
* I cried so much...

966
02:02:25,087 --> 02:02:26,887
* but not a tear I could shed

967
02:02:30,087 --> 02:02:31,647
* I could shed no tear

968
02:02:41,087 --> 02:02:43,487
* You never walked out of my dreams

969
02:02:46,087 --> 02:02:48,487
* Neither did you walk into my arms

970
02:03:14,087 --> 02:03:15,287
* Why did I...

971
02:03:18,087 --> 02:03:19,647
* fall in love with you?

972
02:03:24,087 --> 02:03:25,647
* I didn't find you

973
02:03:29,087 --> 02:03:30,287
* Now I'm lost

974
02:03:35,087 --> 02:03:37,487
* You could never walk
* out of my dreams

975
02:03:41,087 --> 02:03:42,647
* Neither could you...

976
02:03:43,087 --> 02:03:44,647
* walk into my arms

977
02:03:57,087 --> 02:03:58,647
Rahul, take me away.

978
02:04:02,087 --> 02:04:03,887
Everyone is ogling at me.

979
02:04:06,087 --> 02:04:09,087
They're watching you, for
you're looking so pretty. That's it.

980
02:04:10,087 --> 02:04:13,087
Look into my eyes
and say that you aren't lying.

981
02:04:20,087 --> 02:04:23,087
Akshay is your friend.
For his sake you'll lie too?

982
02:04:27,087 --> 02:04:30,087
Akshay loves you dearly, Esha.
And that's no lie.

983
02:04:37,087 --> 02:04:40,087
Had you been in love with me,
would you bring me here like this?

984
02:04:56,087 --> 02:04:57,887
Esha, I want you to meet someone.

985
02:05:13,087 --> 02:05:14,647
What're you doing?

986
02:05:25,087 --> 02:05:28,087
Never mind, dear. Our house
is nearby. Take her home, son.

987
02:05:29,087 --> 02:05:30,887
Go home and have a change, dear.

988
02:05:53,087 --> 02:05:54,887
Akshay, I can't marry you.

989
02:05:57,087 --> 02:06:00,687
I'm going back tomorrow. Only you
can stop this wedding from happening.

990
02:06:02,087 --> 02:06:04,487
Somehow stop this wedding, please.

991
02:06:08,087 --> 02:06:10,487
What're you saying, Esha?
I can't do this.

992
02:06:14,087 --> 02:06:15,887
I...
- I don't love you.

993
02:06:18,087 --> 02:06:21,087
Why do you want to marry a girl
who doesn't love you?

994
02:06:25,087 --> 02:06:26,887
Akshay, I tried hard to reason.

995
02:06:31,087 --> 02:06:34,087
But you aren't the one with whom
I can spend a lifetime.

996
02:06:48,087 --> 02:06:49,887
Are you in love with someone?

997
02:06:53,087 --> 02:06:54,647
You won't understand.

998
02:06:55,087 --> 02:06:57,487
Who is he, Esha?
- I don't know.

999
02:07:00,087 --> 02:07:02,487
All I know is that I love him dearly.

1000
02:07:04,087 --> 02:07:07,087
How is it possible?
- We used to write to each other.

1001
02:07:10,087 --> 02:07:11,647
Slowly, I fell in love.

1002
02:07:13,087 --> 02:07:15,487
Haven't you spoken to him yet?
- No.

1003
02:07:17,087 --> 02:07:20,086
Not even over the phone?
- No, but I've heard his voice.

1004
02:07:20,087 --> 02:07:21,887
D'you have any photograph of his?

1005
02:07:24,087 --> 02:07:25,287
And his name?

1006
02:07:27,087 --> 02:07:28,287
I don't know.

1007
02:07:34,087 --> 02:07:35,887
I told you, you won't understand.

1008
02:07:37,087 --> 02:07:38,887
No, I understand everything.

1009
02:07:40,087 --> 02:07:42,487
Then you'll stop this wedding,
won't you?

1010
02:07:45,087 --> 02:07:46,047
No.

1011
02:07:48,087 --> 02:07:50,487
Because I figure,
there's no such boy.

1012
02:07:52,087 --> 02:07:55,086
I also understand that someone
has taken you for a ride.

1013
02:07:55,087 --> 02:07:56,647
This isn't love, Esha.

1014
02:07:57,087 --> 02:08:00,687
Mere letters don't stem love. To love
someone you need a real human being.

1015
02:08:02,087 --> 02:08:05,087
Whom you can see, you can feel,
with whom you can talk to.

1016
02:08:07,087 --> 02:08:10,087
But the boy, whom you are
talking about, doesn't exist at all.

1017
02:08:13,087 --> 02:08:16,087
He exists. I just got to
spread my arms and reach for him.

1018
02:08:17,087 --> 02:08:20,087
Then spread your arms, Esha...
go and find him.

1019
02:08:25,087 --> 02:08:26,647
You'll find only me.

1020
02:08:29,087 --> 02:08:31,487
So you aren't stopping this wedding?

1021
02:08:33,087 --> 02:08:34,647
You'll not marry me?

1022
02:08:36,087 --> 02:08:37,047
No.

1023
02:08:41,087 --> 02:08:43,487
All right, Esha...
I'll stop this wedding.

1024
02:08:47,087 --> 02:08:48,647
But on one condition.

1025
02:08:50,087 --> 02:08:52,487
Find the one you love and
bring him to me.

1026
02:08:54,087 --> 02:08:56,487
Then I'll stop this wedding.
I promise.

1027
02:08:59,087 --> 02:09:02,086
What happened? Where to find him
is your problem, isn't it?

1028
02:09:02,087 --> 02:09:05,087
You said you know. So go,
find him, Esha. I won't stop you.

1029
02:09:09,087 --> 02:09:11,487
Believe me, more than you,
I shall await him.

1030
02:09:35,087 --> 02:09:37,487
Can you tell me post box 143
belongs to whom?

1031
02:09:39,087 --> 02:09:41,487
Sorry madam,
it goes against our rules.

1032
02:09:43,087 --> 02:09:46,087
I have no other way to contact him.
Please tell me.

1033
02:09:49,087 --> 02:09:52,087
Look madam, I can tell you nothing.
Why don't you ask him who he is?

1034
02:09:55,087 --> 02:09:58,087
Stay here and relax, wait for him.
He does check in once a month.

1035
02:10:19,087 --> 02:10:21,487
I want to close post box 143.
- All right.

1036
02:10:22,087 --> 02:10:23,887
But first you must empty the box.

1037
02:10:35,087 --> 02:10:36,287
* God...

1038
02:10:40,087 --> 02:10:41,647
* What have You done?

1039
02:10:58,087 --> 02:11:01,087
Dearest, this is my final attempt
to find you.

1040
02:11:02,087 --> 02:11:03,647
I want to meet you.

1041
02:11:05,087 --> 02:11:08,087
At least for once...
at least for the last time.

1042
02:11:10,087 --> 02:11:11,887
I'm about to get married.

1043
02:11:13,087 --> 02:11:15,487
But I'm not marrying
until you meet me.

1044
02:11:18,087 --> 02:11:21,687
Because, I can survive without you,
but I cannot live with someone else.

1045
02:11:39,087 --> 02:11:40,887
Esha loves someone else.

1046
02:11:44,087 --> 02:11:45,647
D'you know who he is?

1047
02:11:49,087 --> 02:11:50,287
I know.

1048
02:11:55,087 --> 02:11:56,047
You.

1049
02:12:00,087 --> 02:12:03,087
Look Rahul, I want you to call her up
and say that you don't love her.

1050
02:12:09,087 --> 02:12:12,087
Rahul, Esha is in love with someone
whom she hasn't even seen.

1051
02:12:14,087 --> 02:12:17,087
Nor has she ever met him.
Nor does she know his name.

1052
02:12:18,087 --> 02:12:20,487
Mere letters made her fall in love.

1053
02:12:23,087 --> 02:12:24,887
But who will reason with Esha.

1054
02:12:25,087 --> 02:12:28,087
That's why, pretend to be that guy
and call her up.

1055
02:12:40,087 --> 02:12:41,647
I can't do this.

1056
02:12:42,087 --> 02:12:43,887
Why not?
- This is wrong.

1057
02:12:47,087 --> 02:12:49,487
What's wrong about it?
You don't love her...

1058
02:12:50,087 --> 02:12:51,647
I can't do it. Period.

1059
02:13:01,087 --> 02:13:04,087
If you don't help me,
I don't know what I'm going to do.

1060
02:13:08,087 --> 02:13:11,087
Let alone love, I can't even
look at any other girl.

1061
02:13:26,087 --> 02:13:27,647
I know this is wrong.

1062
02:13:29,087 --> 02:13:30,887
But I really love her, buddy.

1063
02:13:34,087 --> 02:13:35,887
All my life I'll look after Esha.

1064
02:13:38,087 --> 02:13:41,087
Even if I find flaws in her,
I won't complain.

1065
02:13:44,087 --> 02:13:45,887
I'll do what she wants me to.

1066
02:13:47,087 --> 02:13:49,487
I'll become what she makes out of me.

1067
02:13:51,087 --> 02:13:54,087
I'll give her all the joys,
she'll forget sorrows and pain.

1068
02:13:57,087 --> 02:14:00,087
And you know, if she's with me,
she'll forget him.

1069
02:14:11,087 --> 02:14:13,487
You love her so much?
- Dearly.

1070
02:14:19,087 --> 02:14:22,087
Even if I had been in love with her,
I'd have given her up for you.

1071
02:14:54,087 --> 02:14:55,047
You!

1072
02:14:58,087 --> 02:14:59,887
I wish to say something.

1073
02:15:00,087 --> 02:15:01,287
Who are you?

1074
02:15:04,087 --> 02:15:06,487
Now there's no need to know who I am.

1075
02:15:08,087 --> 02:15:10,487
What's important is...
we can't ever meet.

1076
02:15:14,087 --> 02:15:15,287
What...?

1077
02:15:17,087 --> 02:15:18,287
I'm going.

1078
02:15:20,087 --> 02:15:21,647
You can't do this.

1079
02:15:22,087 --> 02:15:23,887
This is what I have to do.

1080
02:15:28,087 --> 02:15:29,647
This is what's right.

1081
02:15:30,087 --> 02:15:33,087
For us, you have no right to
decide all by yourself.

1082
02:15:36,087 --> 02:15:38,487
Some decisions are not in our hands.

1083
02:15:42,087 --> 02:15:43,887
It's up to me to wait for you.

1084
02:15:47,087 --> 02:15:48,887
To love you is up to me.

1085
02:15:52,087 --> 02:15:53,287
Love...?

1086
02:15:55,087 --> 02:15:56,647
You made me trust you.

1087
02:15:58,087 --> 02:16:01,087
We never met, but I always felt you
by my side.

1088
02:16:04,087 --> 02:16:06,487
As if, you're watching me
every moment.

1089
02:16:09,087 --> 02:16:11,487
And now, you want my feelings back?

1090
02:16:14,087 --> 02:16:15,647
I can give you nothing.

1091
02:16:16,087 --> 02:16:17,887
All I want is your company.

1092
02:16:20,087 --> 02:16:21,287
Impossible.

1093
02:16:22,087 --> 02:16:23,647
Why are you doing this?

1094
02:16:25,087 --> 02:16:27,487
I never asked you anything.
Please...

1095
02:16:31,087 --> 02:16:32,647
Ask me nothing.

1096
02:16:34,087 --> 02:16:35,647
Can I ask, you love me?

1097
02:16:46,087 --> 02:16:48,487
Have you ever been in love with me?

1098
02:16:56,087 --> 02:16:59,087
If you can't read my silence, how
can you understand my words, Esha?

1099
02:17:03,087 --> 02:17:05,487
At least you can speak out my name.

1100
02:17:07,087 --> 02:17:08,887
I don't even know your name.

1101
02:17:12,087 --> 02:17:13,647
What's your name?

1102
02:17:16,087 --> 02:17:17,647
What is your name?

1103
02:17:20,087 --> 02:17:22,487
I can't tell.
- Why can't you tell your name?

1104
02:17:26,087 --> 02:17:29,087
Won't I ever get to know the name
of the person I love?

1105
02:17:32,087 --> 02:17:33,887
Tell me your name, please.

1106
02:17:38,087 --> 02:17:39,647
You know my name.

1107
02:17:45,087 --> 02:17:46,887
There are many who have my name.

1108
02:17:49,087 --> 02:17:52,087
What is your name?
Why can't you tell me your name?

1109
02:17:56,087 --> 02:17:59,087
I'm ready to forget everything.
No matter if you don't meet me...

1110
02:18:00,087 --> 02:18:03,087
No matter if you don't love me,
but for once...

1111
02:18:05,087 --> 02:18:07,487
just once, tell me your name. Please.

1112
02:18:08,087 --> 02:18:09,887
Just for once, tell me your name.

1113
02:19:01,087 --> 02:19:03,487
* Go sweetheart,
* I have faith in love

1114
02:19:06,087 --> 02:19:07,647
* I shall wait for you

1115
02:19:17,087 --> 02:19:19,487
* Go my love,
*I have faith in love

1116
02:19:23,087 --> 02:19:24,647
* I shall wait for you

1117
02:19:28,087 --> 02:19:29,647
* I shall go farway...

1118
02:19:33,087 --> 02:19:34,887
* far away from your thoughts

1119
02:19:39,087 --> 02:19:40,647
* Although, my love...

1120
02:19:44,087 --> 02:19:46,487
* I shall not be able to forget you

1121
02:20:37,087 --> 02:20:38,887
* In you, I found a reason to live

1122
02:20:42,087 --> 02:20:43,887
* Oh, but what has it come to be?

1123
02:20:53,087 --> 02:20:54,887
* In you, I found a reason to live

1124
02:20:58,087 --> 02:20:59,887
* Oh, but what has it come to be?

1125
02:21:04,087 --> 02:21:05,887
* I'm still living without you

1126
02:21:09,087 --> 02:21:10,647
* How unfaithful of me

1127
02:21:14,087 --> 02:21:17,087
* Go away, my love,
* for happy days to return...

1128
02:21:20,087 --> 02:21:21,647
* I shall wait for you

1129
02:21:25,087 --> 02:21:27,487
* Yes my love,
*I have faith in love

1130
02:21:31,087 --> 02:21:32,647
* I shall wait for you

1131
02:21:36,087 --> 02:21:37,887
* I shall go so farway...

1132
02:21:41,087 --> 02:21:42,887
* far away from your thoughts

1133
02:21:47,087 --> 02:21:48,647
* Although, my love...

1134
02:21:52,087 --> 02:21:54,487
* I shall not be able to forget you

1135
02:22:55,087 --> 02:22:56,887
* I shall go so farway...

1136
02:23:04,087 --> 02:23:05,887
* far away from your thoughts

1137
02:23:23,087 --> 02:23:24,647
* Perhaps, somehow...

1138
02:23:29,087 --> 02:23:30,887
* if you find news of me...

1139
02:23:34,087 --> 02:23:35,647
* Perhaps, somehow...

1140
02:23:39,087 --> 02:23:40,887
* if you find news of me...

1141
02:23:44,087 --> 02:23:45,647
* just remember me...

1142
02:23:50,087 --> 02:23:51,287
* if you can

1143
02:23:56,087 --> 02:23:58,487
* Go my love,
* my life is with me

1144
02:24:01,087 --> 02:24:02,647
* I shall wait for you

1145
02:24:07,087 --> 02:24:09,487
* Go my love,
* I have faith in love

1146
02:24:12,087 --> 02:24:13,647
* I shall wait for you

1147
02:24:17,087 --> 02:24:18,887
* I shall go so farway...

1148
02:24:22,087 --> 02:24:23,887
* far away from your thoughts

1149
02:24:28,087 --> 02:24:29,647
* Although, my love...

1150
02:24:33,087 --> 02:24:35,487
* I shall not be able to forget you

1151
02:24:43,087 --> 02:24:45,487
Rahul, how does one fall in love?
- Love...?

1152
02:24:47,087 --> 02:24:49,487
Love just happens.
How, you and I never know.

1153
02:25:09,087 --> 02:25:11,487
Namaskar to all Indians in Canada.

1154
02:25:14,087 --> 02:25:16,487
Let me tell you something important.

1155
02:25:17,087 --> 02:25:20,087
An Indian photographer Mr Rahul Sharma
staying in Vancouver...

1156
02:25:21,087 --> 02:25:24,087
for the last four years is
exhibiting photographs today...

1157
02:25:26,087 --> 02:25:29,087
in Richment shopping mall.
You must go and see his works.

1158
02:25:31,087 --> 02:25:34,087
Because, you will find an
Indian bride's image...

1159
02:25:35,087 --> 02:25:37,487
through the eyes of Mr Rahul Sharma.

1160
02:25:45,087 --> 02:25:46,887
Stop, Rahul. C'mon, stop.

1161
02:26:25,087 --> 02:26:26,887
I looked for you everywhere.

1162
02:26:27,964 --> 02:26:29,164
Four years!

1163
02:26:29,964 --> 02:26:32,964
You're in front of me, I still
can't believe my eyes.

1164
02:26:35,964 --> 02:26:37,524
Are you angry with me?

1165
02:26:38,964 --> 02:26:40,164
How are you?

1166
02:26:41,964 --> 02:26:44,364
Buddy, I know what I made you do
was wrong.

1167
02:26:47,964 --> 02:26:50,964
You asked me to get married,
and then you vanished.

1168
02:26:51,964 --> 02:26:53,764
Didn't you ever miss me?

1169
02:27:25,964 --> 02:27:28,964
You always said, I'd really
fall in love someday.

1170
02:27:48,964 --> 02:27:51,364
But...
- No buddy, I couldn't marry Esha.

1171
02:27:53,964 --> 02:27:56,364
Maybe we were not made
for each other.

1172
02:27:56,964 --> 02:28:00,564
I was in her sight, but her eyes were
always searching for someone else.

1173
02:28:00,964 --> 02:28:03,364
She was before me, but not with me.

1174
02:28:03,964 --> 02:28:05,764
Then how could I marry her?

1175
02:28:07,964 --> 02:28:09,164
And Esha...?

1176
02:28:12,964 --> 02:28:14,764
She's still waiting for him.

1177
02:28:17,964 --> 02:28:20,964
I reasoned with her. But she feels
he'll come someday. Can't help it.

1178
02:28:23,964 --> 02:28:26,964
I find the guy strange, too.
He's in love with love...

1179
02:28:27,964 --> 02:28:30,964
he talks with the wind,
he lives in the skies, he flies.

1180
02:28:31,964 --> 02:28:33,524
Wonder who he is.

1181
02:28:34,964 --> 02:28:36,764
All I want to know is that...

1182
02:28:36,964 --> 02:28:39,964
if he loves her truly,
why hasn't he appeared as yet?

1183
02:29:49,964 --> 02:29:52,964
Why didn't you tell me?
- Had you been in my shoes...

1184
02:29:54,964 --> 02:29:56,524
what'd you have done?

1185
02:30:11,964 --> 02:30:13,524
She still awaits you.

1186
02:30:17,964 --> 02:30:18,924
Go.

1187
02:34:52,964 --> 02:34:54,524
You know my name.

1188
02:34:56,964 --> 02:34:58,164
I'm Rahul.

1189
02:35:02,964 --> 02:35:04,524
And I madly love you.
