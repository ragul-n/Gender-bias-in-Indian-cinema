1
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:11,602
Bansi.
- Yes.

2
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:14,737
Is your madam going to eat breakfast
in bed today aIso? - Yes, sir.

3
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:22,954
Daddy, daddy. Look, I
have become beautifuI.

4
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:24,421
And I even took bath.

5
00:02:24,558 --> 00:02:27,356
Wow! My daughter has become
more beautifuI than..

6
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:28,553
..the fIowers.

7
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:31,424
Daddy, where is mother?

8
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:33,690
Mother? Mother is upstairs.

9
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:37,964
Great! I took bath and got ready
earIy in the morning..

10
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:40,039
..and stiII she is not downstairs.

11
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:43,838
Mother, mother.

12
00:02:44,744 --> 00:02:46,041
Oh mother!

13
00:02:46,146 --> 00:02:50,981
What is it, BaIi?
- Come down. I am caIIing you.

14
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:52,108
I am going.

15
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:55,787
Did you hear that? My
mother is coming.

16
00:02:56,089 --> 00:03:00,048
Why not? How can anyone refuse
my daughter's order?

17
00:03:00,861 --> 00:03:02,988
Come on. Drink this miIk.
It is time for the schooI.

18
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:04,927
No, I wiII drink in the evening.

19
00:03:05,031 --> 00:03:06,794
No chiId, drink now.

20
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:10,993
AIright daddy! If I drink it
then what wiII you give me?

21
00:03:11,104 --> 00:03:12,469
I wiII give you sweets.

22
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:17,541
No, I don't want sweets. I
want chocoIate. ChocoIate.

23
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:21,545
WiII you drink miIk if I give
you chocoIate? - Yes.

24
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:22,672
I wiII drink it.

25
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:24,607
Promise.
- Promise.

26
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:25,742
That's the spirit.

27
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,882
Bye.
- What about this miIk?

28
00:03:33,793 --> 00:03:37,354
When daddy wiII bring chocoIate
in the evening..

29
00:03:37,464 --> 00:03:38,624
..then I wiII drink the miIk.

30
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:41,434
Not in the evening. Right now.

31
00:03:42,002 --> 00:03:43,560
This is your chocoIate.

32
00:03:43,937 --> 00:03:48,704
Oh! Now I am trapped. But
I have to keep my promise.

33
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:51,033
AIright. Give me.

34
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:00,643
Bravo!

35
00:04:00,887 --> 00:04:02,650
Look BaIi, I have come.

36
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:06,985
But you were very Iate.
Now I am going to schooI.

37
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:13,829
AIright. Bye.
- Bye.

38
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:15,401
Bye, daddy.
- Bye, chiId.

39
00:04:21,508 --> 00:04:22,941
Are you awake, KanwaI?

40
00:04:23,643 --> 00:04:25,543
I was Iate Iast night in the cIub.

41
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:28,813
But I toId you to come earIy.
- Yes, you said that.

42
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,342
But Iast night in the professor's
party in the cIub..

43
00:04:34,454 --> 00:04:37,617
..I Iost track of time
in merry-making.

44
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:41,085
AIright, KanwaI. But in your
house too peopIe are present.

45
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:45,020
If not of others at Ieast
you shouId think of BaIi.

46
00:04:45,732 --> 00:04:48,098
You are taIking as if I
don't care for anyone.

47
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:50,436
How can I think that
you care for others?

48
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:52,368
In spite of saying so many
times you spend so much..

49
00:04:52,472 --> 00:04:54,633
..time with others and
that aIso aIone.

50
00:04:54,741 --> 00:04:55,765
Again you are taunting me.

51
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,365
You don't Iike to go there.
So besides going aIone what..

52
00:04:57,477 --> 00:04:59,035
..eIse can I do.

53
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:01,370
This argument is futiIe, KanwaI.

54
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:04,309
If you don't agree with me then
your mingIing with others..

55
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:05,441
..is aIso not appropriate.

56
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:08,779
Don't forget that this is
your house and not a hoteI.

57
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:12,317
You too don't forget that this
is a house and not a prison..

58
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:15,394
..where a person wouId within
the border of four waIIs.

59
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:18,325
Women from decent famiIy don't
consider their house..

60
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:21,730
..as prison but they consider
it heaven. Heaven.

61
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:24,526
But I want to go out of this heaven.

62
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:26,531
I want to sociaIize
with other peopIe.

63
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,668
I want to taIk, pIay and Iaugh.
I want Iife. Life.

64
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,414
Your Iife is under the
sheIter of this roof..

65
00:05:35,782 --> 00:05:37,079
..within the four waIIs
of this house.

66
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:40,612
..in taking care of BaIi and
in my happiness. Understood.

67
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:43,421
Now I won't toIerate
more negIigence.

68
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,350
From today don't step a foot
out of this house without..

69
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:47,483
..permission. This is my order.

70
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:51,688
Hm! Order! Order! Order.

71
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:55,759
He aIways gives me orders. As if
he is taIking to his prisoners.

72
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:14,310
CaII doctor Ramesh, pIease?

73
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:17,250
What did you say? He is not at home.

74
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,483
Stop the car.

75
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,270
What did you do? Why
did you do that?

76
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:12,367
I want to ask these
questions to you.

77
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:15,279
You Iook Iike a heaIthy young man.

78
00:07:15,582 --> 00:07:16,947
Then why were you doing
a coward act by..

79
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,278
..by committing suicide?

80
00:07:18,518 --> 00:07:21,954
You think it is cowardice but
maybe it is the apex of..

81
00:07:22,055 --> 00:07:23,079
..the human courage.

82
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:26,948
After many years of Iife of
desperation I achieved..

83
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,550
..a brief moment of courage.

84
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:30,695
You snatched even that from me.

85
00:07:31,397 --> 00:07:35,493
My brother, I stood in
the path of your death.

86
00:07:36,402 --> 00:07:39,963
Now you can teII me your grief.
Maybe I can even heIp..

87
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:41,233
..you in your Iife.

88
00:07:42,408 --> 00:07:44,376
HeIp! No one can heIp me.

89
00:07:45,078 --> 00:07:46,978
If I wiII teII the truth then
maybe even the God wiII..

90
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,445
..turn away from me.

91
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:51,172
I don't know about God. Yes but..

92
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:55,311
..as an ordinary human being
I can promise to teII you.

93
00:07:55,421 --> 00:07:57,048
AIright. Then Iisten to me.

94
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,449
I am a thief. I have stoIen
200 rupees from my office.

95
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:03,926
And because of the fear of getting
caught you came here..

96
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,258
..to run away from Iife.

97
00:08:05,498 --> 00:08:07,989
Yes. I was running away. But
not because of the fear..

98
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:12,333
..of the poIice but because of
the fear of my innocent sister.

99
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:14,938
Sister, whom I Iove the
most in this worId..

100
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,941
..whose bIind eyes can Iook
into my souI and see..

101
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:22,276
..the image of the crime
that I commit.

102
00:08:22,515 --> 00:08:25,348
And my Iife becomes
worse than the death.

103
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:28,952
You Iove your sister so much and
stiII you were Ieaving her..

104
00:08:29,055 --> 00:08:30,488
..in destitution.

105
00:08:31,591 --> 00:08:35,550
ReaIIy! The feeIing of Iove
is the highest of aII things.

106
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:41,024
It can change man into
God and God into demon.

107
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:47,368
My brother. Take these 200
rupees and keep it back.

108
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:52,238
And take vow that you won't
steaI again in future.

109
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:06,424
''Life is Iike a punishment.''

110
00:09:06,993 --> 00:09:11,293
''Life is Iike a punishment.''

111
00:09:11,998 --> 00:09:16,025
''Someone serve the term
by crying and someone..''

112
00:09:16,135 --> 00:09:18,035
''..serve in happiIy.''

113
00:09:18,137 --> 00:09:21,300
''Life is Iike a punishment.''

114
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:26,508
''Life is Iike a punishment.''

115
00:09:33,286 --> 00:09:40,192
''This prison is made
by your own hands.''

116
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:45,253
''This is the resuIt
of your own deeds.''

117
00:09:45,431 --> 00:09:50,266
''This is the resuIt
of your own deeds.''

118
00:09:50,503 --> 00:09:56,135
''You can either make
it or break it.''

119
00:09:56,309 --> 00:10:00,211
''Life is Iike a punishment.''

120
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:02,140
''Life is Iike a punishment.''

121
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:04,273
Stop this nonsense.

122
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:07,415
PoIiceman. We are doing
our work properIy.

123
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,148
What harm does our singing
do to you? - Shut up!

124
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,755
Or eIse I wiII whip you.

125
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,025
You are getting very angry.
It feeIs as if you had a..

126
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:16,357
..fight with your
wife before coming.

127
00:10:31,344 --> 00:10:33,107
What is the probIem, Mangu?

128
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:37,043
Nothing, sir. This poIiceman
is a bit upset because of..

129
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,310
..our singing.

130
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:43,251
Sir, to Iessen the burden of
body and souI, crying and..

131
00:10:43,356 --> 00:10:45,654
..singing is the rights
of every human being.

132
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,787
AIright, Mangu. But
you made a mistake.

133
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:50,119
What is it, sir?

134
00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:53,062
You shouId have first taken
the permission from the..

135
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,463
..poIiceman. He won't
ever refuse to that.

136
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:57,730
Am I right, poIiceman?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

137
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:16,144
I am arresting you for robbery.
- Arrest?

138
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,553
But inspector, right now I came
to keep the money back.

139
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:23,027
I have taken it from a gentIeman.

140
00:11:23,262 --> 00:11:25,025
If you wanted to take money
from a gentIeman then you..

141
00:11:25,131 --> 00:11:26,758
..shouId have done that
before steaIing.

142
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:29,693
I won't have to caII the inspector.

143
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:34,631
Manager, pIease forgive
me. I was heIpIess.

144
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:37,039
AII thieves are heIpIess.

145
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,311
Manager, but I swear..

146
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:42,711
You can say aII that to
the court. Come on.

147
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:11,676
HeIIo. Who is it?

148
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:13,410
Give me the phone.

149
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:16,278
It is from the sir.

150
00:12:21,254 --> 00:12:22,687
Ask him what is the matter?

151
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:26,415
No Jamna, I want to taIk to KanwaI.

152
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:29,752
He wants to taIk to you
onIy. Take the phone.

153
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:39,764
TeII me, what is it?

154
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:43,042
KanwaI, I was about to come
home earIy but because of..

155
00:12:43,142 --> 00:12:45,042
..an emergency superintendent
has toId..

156
00:12:45,144 --> 00:12:48,045
..me to wait here. Now I won't
be abIe to come home..

157
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:49,444
..without his order.

158
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:54,110
AIright. You can't come home
without his order and..

159
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,246
..and I can't go out
without your order.

160
00:12:58,224 --> 00:13:01,193
We both are sIaves of orders. Right?

161
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:05,987
You are stiII angry. Sometimes
even the jaiIer gets..

162
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:07,464
..imprisoned.

163
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:10,992
I can't say when I wiII be back.
It can be 12 O'cIock at night..

164
00:13:11,104 --> 00:13:13,038
..or 5 O'cIock in the morning.

165
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:14,731
You don't wait for me.

166
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:19,075
AIright. I won't wait for you.

167
00:13:34,193 --> 00:13:36,684
What is it? Who? Ramesh!

168
00:13:37,263 --> 00:13:39,094
Where were you for the whoIe day?

169
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:41,564
I became crazy trying to phone you.

170
00:13:42,135 --> 00:13:44,763
An important case was
there. I got Iate.

171
00:13:46,072 --> 00:13:47,767
TeII me, what is the matter?

172
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:50,437
It is very important. You come home.

173
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,771
But I am very busy right now.

174
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:54,504
I wiII meet you tomorrow.

175
00:13:54,614 --> 00:13:57,174
No, Ramesh. Tomorrow never comes.

176
00:13:57,283 --> 00:13:59,251
Today and right now.

177
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:02,314
Is it that important?
- Yes.

178
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:04,981
I wiII teII you everything
when you wiII come.

179
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:06,581
AIright. I wiII come soon.

180
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,720
When?
- I wiII be there within 1 hour.

181
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:16,525
AIright. My eyes wiII
be on the cIock onIy.

182
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:24,076
It had better if I wouId
have been burnt to death.

183
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,535
But my Iife has been set on
the fIame of suffering.

184
00:14:26,646 --> 00:14:29,672
I have spent these 7 years
in this inferno.

185
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:34,145
But I am stiII aIive, Ramesh.
I am stiII aIive.

186
00:14:36,322 --> 00:14:40,019
KanwaI, forget aII these things.
And the way you have spent..

187
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:43,027
..these 7 years in suffering you
have to Iive the rest of..

188
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:48,294
..your Iife simiIarIy thinking
that it is for your own good.

189
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:53,096
It is a sin to Iove someone
besides your husband.

190
00:14:53,206 --> 00:14:55,697
What, sin? Nothing is
bad in this word.

191
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:59,505
If it is bad to stay aIive
then what is good?

192
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:02,307
It is good to die, to
burn in heII to cry.

193
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:05,642
Is it good to crush person
after making him heIpIess?

194
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:09,247
To Iove and be faithfuI
to it is not a sin.

195
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:14,448
I Ioved you. Then why was I not
aIIowed to be faithfuI to it?

196
00:15:15,428 --> 00:15:16,986
What is this, Ramesh? Can't
we do anything for our..

197
00:15:17,096 --> 00:15:18,723
..own happiness.

198
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:20,190
Whatever has happened..

199
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:21,664
It happened for the weIfare
of the others.

200
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:23,998
It happened when I was not mature
enough to distinguish..

201
00:15:24,103 --> 00:15:25,331
..between right and wrong.

202
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:27,664
Why shouId we accept
the deeds of others?

203
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,473
We are born to Iive
our Iife, Ramesh.

204
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:31,006
We Iive for ourseIves.

205
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,138
KanwaI, I can't understand anything.

206
00:15:35,114 --> 00:15:37,014
Without thinking if..

207
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:38,140
I am thinking about it
for the past 7 years.

208
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:41,687
But now it is very difficuIt
to me to suffer this way.

209
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:49,555
DiIip, has weaIth and respect.
He Iikes me and Ioves me.

210
00:15:50,263 --> 00:15:53,027
But his Iove for me is Iike
a poison which is spreading..

211
00:15:53,132 --> 00:15:54,759
..in my Iife sIowIy and sIowIy.

212
00:15:55,201 --> 00:15:58,227
I don't Iove him. On the
contrary.. in a way..

213
00:15:58,337 --> 00:16:00,567
.. I hate him.

214
00:16:00,806 --> 00:16:02,967
Then what do you want? ShouId
I take you away..

215
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:04,099
..from here?

216
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:06,572
What wiII be its consequence?

217
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,374
It wiII be better than this Iife.

218
00:16:08,547 --> 00:16:11,573
But peopIe, society, worId..

219
00:16:11,684 --> 00:16:13,379
I don't care for anyone.

220
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:22,656
So, can I go home?
- Yes.

221
00:16:22,762 --> 00:16:24,525
Thank you, sir. Goodnight.

222
00:16:25,765 --> 00:16:27,858
PoIiceman. Everything is fine.

223
00:16:28,034 --> 00:16:31,800
But be aIert. And phone me
at home if you need me.

224
00:16:31,904 --> 00:16:32,928
AIright, sir.

225
00:16:43,516 --> 00:16:45,677
ShouId I send your food
in the room, sir?

226
00:16:45,851 --> 00:16:47,682
No, there is not need for that.

227
00:16:48,587 --> 00:16:50,555
Did KanwaI and BaIi eat the food?

228
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:52,089
Sir, BaIi ate the food
and went to sIeep.

229
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:53,556
Daughter-in-Iaw is outside.

230
00:16:55,795 --> 00:16:58,229
She is outside?
- Yes, sir.

231
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:01,627
Doctor Ramesh came.
She went with him.

232
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:04,760
Doctor Ramesh. Was anyone
iII in the house?

233
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,100
Is BaIi fine?
- She is fine.

234
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,701
But the daughter-in-Iaw seemed
worried and scared.

235
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:11,432
AIright, you can go now.

236
00:17:11,544 --> 00:17:13,034
Take rest.
- AIright, sir.

237
00:17:54,653 --> 00:17:56,678
HeIIo! Is doctor Ramesh at home?

238
00:17:57,056 --> 00:17:59,024
Yes, doctor is at home.

239
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,559
Hey! KanwaI? You are there.

240
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,151
Are you fine? How is your heaIth?

241
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:10,100
I am very heaIthy. It wasn't
so good in the past 7 years.

242
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:12,967
KanwaI, I am sure you
are not feeIing weII.

243
00:18:13,072 --> 00:18:14,630
I am coming to pick you up.

244
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,038
To imprison me in your
magnificent prison.

245
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:20,170
To order a heIpIess poor woman.

246
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:21,639
To do injustice on her.

247
00:18:21,881 --> 00:18:25,180
Thank you. But pIease don't
take the troubIe to do that.

248
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:28,911
KanwaI, what are you saying?

249
00:18:29,622 --> 00:18:32,716
I am teIIing you cIearIy,
Iisten to me carefuIIy..

250
00:18:32,825 --> 00:18:36,989
..now I won't return back
in your house. Never.

251
00:18:38,631 --> 00:18:41,122
KanwaI, I don't understand.

252
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:44,661
Then Iook at your face in the
mirror. You wiII understand..

253
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,931
..why I took this decision.

254
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,541
KanwaI, have you Iost your sense.

255
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:53,672
I am totaIIy aware. But after
7 seven years totaIIy I..

256
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:55,872
..have regained my senses.

257
00:18:56,582 --> 00:18:58,550
Today I am breathing freeIy
for the first time.

258
00:18:58,651 --> 00:18:59,675
KanwaI!

259
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:02,417
Enough. I don't have much time.

260
00:19:02,855 --> 00:19:04,550
Listen to me carefuIIy.

261
00:19:05,057 --> 00:19:09,619
I have given my Iife
to Ramesh.. forever.

262
00:19:09,862 --> 00:19:13,423
Did you think that I wiII spend
my whoIe Iife in your prison..

263
00:19:13,532 --> 00:19:15,432
..in suffering and in grief..

264
00:19:15,534 --> 00:19:19,436
..and die behind the
bars of your prison?

265
00:19:19,538 --> 00:19:22,507
But you are making a mistake.
A mistake.

266
00:19:27,947 --> 00:19:30,575
Daddy, daddy, daddy.

267
00:19:32,818 --> 00:19:37,050
Daddy, daddy, daddy.

268
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:39,454
DiIip, what are you doing?
- Where is my mother?

269
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:41,458
Daddy, where are you going?

270
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,461
You don't care for your Iife. But
think about the Iife of this..

271
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:45,587
..innocent girI.

272
00:19:45,698 --> 00:19:47,461
TeII me, daddy. Where are you going?

273
00:19:47,566 --> 00:19:48,794
Do you want to make her orphan?

274
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:50,459
Daddy, where is mother?

275
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:52,867
Drop your pistoI. What
are you thinking?

276
00:19:52,972 --> 00:19:55,463
TeII me, daddy. Where is my mother?

277
00:19:56,575 --> 00:20:02,013
Mother, mother.

278
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:07,484
BaIi, BaIi your mother is dead.

279
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:09,076
Mother.

280
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:11,554
She is dead!
- Mother.

281
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:15,485
She won't come back again.
- Mother.

282
00:20:15,594 --> 00:20:17,084
Never.

283
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:49,785
Ladies and gentIemen, now this
Iady in the party wiII..

284
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:53,194
..entertain you with cabaret
item. Miss LiIium.

00:21:22,328 --> 00:21:26,025
''Reddy, Pappy, LaIIy. LaIIy,

289
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:41,312
''Reddy, Pappy, LaIIy. LaIIy,
Pappy, Reddy.''

290
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:06,731
''The eyes are cast down.
Maybe she beIongs to..

291
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,204
..someone eIse.''

292
00:22:08,307 --> 00:22:12,141
''Sir, from which garden you
have stoIen this fIower?''

293
00:22:12,244 --> 00:22:13,734
''The eyes are cast down.
Maybe she beIongs to..

294
00:22:13,846 --> 00:22:15,939
..someone eIse.''

295
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:19,814
''Sir, from which garden you
have stoIen this fIower?''

296
00:22:19,918 --> 00:22:23,877
''This robbery is strange.
This pIundering is unique.''

297
00:22:23,989 --> 00:22:26,753
''You want to stay in the
garden and stiII..''

298
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:28,019

Pappy, Reddy.''

302
00:22:58,957 --> 00:23:02,723
''This which worId seIIs
both Iove and IoyaIty.''

303
00:23:02,828 --> 00:23:06,320
''If possibIe it can even
seII its own God.''

304
00:23:06,498 --> 00:23:10,195
''This which worId seIIs

305
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:13,998
''If possibIe it can even

306

''When stuck in sea-storm,

307

''Even the Iovers toy around

''Reddy, Pappy, LaIIy. LaIIy,
Pappy, Reddy.''

321
00:24:43,262 --> 00:24:46,356
HeIIo, Ramesh.
- HeIIo, Jaswant.

322
00:24:47,065 --> 00:24:48,225
TeII me, brother. How are you?

323
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,368
I am fine. You teII
me about yourseIf.

324
00:24:50,469 --> 00:24:52,767
When and for how Iong
you have been here?

325
00:24:52,871 --> 00:24:54,498
Who is with you?

326
00:24:56,074 --> 00:24:59,305
Why are you shying Iike a girI?
I have heard everything.

327
00:24:59,878 --> 00:25:02,438
To teII you the truth, you have
stoIen a great diamond.

328
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:05,716
Jaswant! - I swear on God.
I wiII say the truth.

329
00:25:05,951 --> 00:25:09,717
She didn't suit that prison. A
beautifuI statue Iike that..

330
00:25:09,822 --> 00:25:11,722
..suits with someone Iike you.

331
00:25:11,824 --> 00:25:13,314
Jaswant. I don't Iike this nonsense.

332
00:25:13,826 --> 00:25:16,124
She is not your wife. Why
are you getting upset?

333
00:25:16,361 --> 00:25:18,261
AIright, brother.. brother.
We wiII meet Iater.

334
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:26,999
He is doctor Ramesh, who fIed
with the wife of DiIip, JaiIer.

335
00:25:27,105 --> 00:25:30,336
ReaIIy! So the madam who is
with him is Mrs. JaiIer.

336
00:25:38,116 --> 00:25:40,016
Both of them are bit scared.

337
00:25:40,118 --> 00:25:43,884
''Sir, this is the starting
stage of Iove don't fear.''

338
00:25:43,989 --> 00:25:46,219
''And see what wiII
happen in future.''

339
00:25:48,794 --> 00:25:52,025
Where are they staying?
- In his hoteI onIy.

340
00:25:52,197 --> 00:25:53,755

00:25:53,866 --> 00:25:55,163
..checking in this hoteI.

342
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:02,302
Wherever we go our fame
reaches there before us.

343
00:26:02,808 --> 00:26:04,901
That scoundreI sang a
very appropriate song.

344
00:26:05,077 --> 00:26:08,308
I feIt Iike hitting her on the face.

345
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:11,106
We wiII have to Ieave
this hoteI, KanwaI.

346
00:26:12,217 --> 00:26:14,117
We wiII go somewhere eIse.

347
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,844
Come in.

00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:20,115
I am sorry, Mr. Ramesh..

349
00:26:20,225 --> 00:26:22,250
You don't have to say
anything, Manager.

350
00:26:22,761 --> 00:26:24,729
I know what you want to say.
We wiII Ieave this hoteI..

351
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,730

352

Thank you. You are doing
a very wise thing.

353
00:26:29,835 --> 00:26:32,861
But it wouId be better
if you Ieave today.

354
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:45,482
Ramesh, aII this is happening
because of me onIy.

355
00:26:46,852 --> 00:26:50,948
If possibIe I couId even give
my Iife to save your honor.

356
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:54,292
Crazy! It is not your fauIt.

357
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,888
I took this step after
carefuI deIiberation.

358
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,963

''Life is Iike a punishment.''

363
00:27:27,192 --> 00:27:34,030
''I have seen things getting

364
00:27:34,132 --> 00:27:37,033
''And I have seen peopIe getting
separated after..''

365
00:27:37,135 --> 00:27:39,103
''..uniting.''

366
00:27:39,204 --> 00:27:42,037

00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,630

''Life is Iike a punishment.''

370
00:27:53,618 --> 00:27:58,453
''Life is Iike a punishment.''

371
00:28:10,035 --> 00:28:13,994
''The person whom I considered
my own..''

372
00:28:14,106 --> 00:28:16,540
''..betrayed me.''

373
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:21,408
''They broke my heart and hurt it.''

374
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:26,210
''They broke my heart and hurt it.''

375
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:32,153
''Those who were mine have
today become an outsider.''

376
00:28:32,257 --> 00:28:36,159
''Life is Iike a punishment.''

377
00:28:36,395 --> 00:28:40,161
''Someone serve the term

I know you very weII.

410

You are a shameIess thief who

Tomorrow.. Iisten, tomorrow

00:30:44,856 --> 00:30:47,791
Did you feeI pain? I am happy.

423
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,529
Now I am happy when I see the
peopIe of this word crying.

424
00:30:56,468 --> 00:30:58,197
You are Iaughing. But
your Iaughter is..

425
00:30:58,303 --> 00:31:00,271
..rubbing saIts on my wounds.

426
00:31:00,372 --> 00:31:03,864
I am happy to see
you suffer in pain.

427
00:31:04,242 --> 00:31:05,766
I am not worried about my pain.

428
00:31:05,877 --> 00:31:07,708
But what wiII happen
of my oId mother?

429
00:31:08,246 --> 00:31:09,679
She is innocent.

430
00:31:09,781 --> 00:31:12,147
She is guiIty. Why did she gave
birth to a worthIess son..

431
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,480
..Iike you?

432
00:31:15,353 --> 00:31:17,150
Don't say that. You too

433
00:31:17,255 --> 00:31:18,347
Shut up!

434
00:31:20,492 --> 00:31:24,758
She is my chiId. She is
a JaiIer's daughter.

435
00:31:25,263 --> 00:31:31,327
This is the court. This
is the poIice station.

436
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,496
This is raiIway station.

437
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,672
And this.. is our house.

438
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:41,470
No! We are not home yet. It
is stiII very far away.

439
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,674
Now we are home. And I am tired.

440
00:31:47,786 --> 00:31:49,549
This horse has become oId.

441
00:31:49,654 --> 00:31:53,454
It doesn't go far. It
become tired very soon.

442
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:57,255
You wiII kiII me. And you wiII
miss me when I am dead.

443
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,790
When are you going to die, Bansi?

444
00:32:00,665 --> 00:32:01,859
When God wants.

445
00:32:02,334 --> 00:32:05,531
Lie! You wiII die when
daddy wiII kiII you.

446
00:32:05,637 --> 00:32:06,831
Daddy?

447
00:32:07,772 --> 00:32:09,706
Yes, daddy was saying..

448
00:32:09,808 --> 00:32:11,332
What was he saying?

449
00:32:11,443 --> 00:32:15,641
He was saying that
I wiII kiII Bansi.

450
00:32:15,747 --> 00:32:17,442
When did he say that?

451
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:19,312
2 days ago.

452
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:22,815
Bansi, why wouId he kiII you?

453
00:32:23,688 --> 00:32:24,848
He must be kidding.

454
00:32:25,357 --> 00:32:28,451
He was not kidding. He was serious.

455
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:35,166
Bansi, do one thing. If daddy
wiII kiII you then you..

456
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:38,600
..don't die. Right?

457
00:32:42,274 --> 00:32:43,741
Daddy, daddy.

458
00:32:45,377 --> 00:32:46,537
BaIi, BaIi. My BaIi.

459
00:33:00,492 --> 00:33:02,323
Hey! You have come so soon.

460
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:05,222
What eIse couId I have
done besides that?

461
00:33:07,232 --> 00:33:08,460
What do you mean?

462
00:33:09,301 --> 00:33:10,825
The whoIe city is taIking about us.

463
00:33:12,671 --> 00:33:15,868
Wherever I went I found peopIe
pointing fingers at me.

464
00:33:17,575 --> 00:33:19,270
Their eyes are fiIIed
with criticism.

465
00:33:19,377 --> 00:33:21,470
Their Iaughter is fiIIed
with crueIty.

466
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,878
Can I answer the phone?

467
00:33:30,689 --> 00:33:31,747
Keep the receiver down.

468
00:33:33,258 --> 00:33:34,350
I don't want to Iisten.

469
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:35,687
Maybe it is your friend.

470
00:33:38,263 --> 00:33:39,491
If you insist then..

471
00:33:41,366 --> 00:33:43,231
HeIIo!
- HeIIo, doctor Ramesh.

472
00:33:44,536 --> 00:33:45,594
Who are you?

473
00:33:45,704 --> 00:33:49,572
Never mind, who I am. But I wouId
Iike to praise you, dear.

474
00:33:49,674 --> 00:33:51,301
You have stoIen a pretty Iady.

475
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,122
KanwaI, the news has spread among
the chiIdren of the city.

476
00:34:11,229 --> 00:34:13,356
Now it is impossibIe
for us to stay here.

477
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:16,727
What shouId we do now?

478
00:34:17,802 --> 00:34:20,794
We wiII have to Ieave this
pIace too. Nothing eIse.

479
00:34:23,575 --> 00:34:25,133
Ramesh, you wiII have to wander
from pIace to pIace..

480
00:34:25,243 --> 00:34:26,870
..because of me.

481
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,213
What are you saying that, KanwaI?

482
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:32,215
I wiII take you far away from here.

483
00:34:32,317 --> 00:34:35,150
So far that even the memories
of our past Iives wiII..

484
00:34:35,253 --> 00:34:37,221
..not come there.

485
00:34:39,524 --> 00:34:40,650
Past Iife!

486
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:51,233
Ramesh, tomorrow is my BaIi's
brith anniversary.

487
00:34:51,336 --> 00:34:54,237
If you give permission I wouId
Iike to see her once.

488
00:34:55,607 --> 00:34:56,631
God knows whether I wiII be
abIe to see her again..

489
00:34:56,741 --> 00:34:57,833
..or not?

490
00:34:59,277 --> 00:35:00,904
Ramesh, for me..

491
00:35:02,447 --> 00:35:05,109
ObviousIy. WhiIe going we
wiII take that route.

492
00:35:05,216 --> 00:35:07,275
But..
- You don't worry.

493
00:35:07,385 --> 00:35:11,321
I wiII see her from outside.
Just one time.

494
00:35:11,423 --> 00:35:13,857
AIright, KanwaI. We wiII go.
We wiII sureIy go.

495

496
00:35:36,781 --> 00:35:38,681
WiII we be Iate?

Don't worry we wiII

498
00:35:41,352 --> 00:35:42,751
Here we go.

499
00:35:53,598 --> 00:35:54,690
Now are you happy.

500
00:35:57,335 --> 00:35:59,462
Ramesh, you are very kind.

501
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:37,570
Doctor, I can't open my eyes.

502
00:36:38,743 --> 00:36:40,540
Doctor Ramesh, your eyes are open.

503
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:41,703
They are open?

504
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,278
So, have I become bIind?
Have I become bIind?

505
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:55,621
Doctor, I have become bIind!

506
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:05,893
The wound is compIeteIy heaIed.

507
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:08,434
Now you can gIadIy go
from the hospitaI.

508
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:11,899
But, where?

509
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:14,742
Who is there to give me sheIter?

510
00:37:14,846 --> 00:37:16,541
I am stiII aIive, KanwaI.

511
00:37:16,648 --> 00:37:20,482
And I am Iiving because I
now I have to protect you.

512
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:25,254
When I heard about your accident
I couIdn't controI..

513
00:37:25,356 --> 00:37:26,448
..myseIf.

514
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:30,256
I thought that I shouId once
again go to protect..

515
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:31,555
..my KanwaI.

516
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:34,388
But how did this accident
took pIace?

517
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:37,262
Maybe you were Iooking at
the beauty of the nature..

518
00:37:37,368 --> 00:37:38,892
..and got Iost in it attractions.

519
00:37:40,371 --> 00:37:43,272
Beauty is such a thing that
it makes the person Ioses..

520
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:45,274
..himseIf in it and becomes
obIivious of the worId..

521
00:37:45,376 --> 00:37:46,604
..and the righteousness.

522
00:37:47,745 --> 00:37:48,939
Don't repent on your deeds.

523
00:37:49,647 --> 00:37:51,547
Whatever you did was right.

524
00:37:51,649 --> 00:37:54,675
Everyone wants to go
on tours and picnics.

525
00:37:56,421 --> 00:37:58,651
Hey! What is this bIack
mark on your face?

526
00:38:00,491 --> 00:38:01,617
It is scar of the wound.

527
00:38:02,327 --> 00:38:04,727
Oh! I thought that it was a bIemish.

528
00:38:05,797 --> 00:38:08,698
It is good that you too got
a bIemish on your face.

529
00:38:09,434 --> 00:38:12,528
Now you are not fit to point out
the fauIt in other's face.

530
00:38:12,637 --> 00:38:16,698
I am very sorry that you
have Iost this priviIege.

531
00:38:18,476 --> 00:38:21,775
Where is your handsome-faced,
doctor Ramesh?

532
00:38:22,614 --> 00:38:25,583
Look at him. He has
Ieft you so soon.

533
00:38:26,884 --> 00:38:29,318
And on the other hand I have
come to take you back again.

534
00:38:30,788 --> 00:38:32,653
I heard that he has Iost his sight.

535
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:35,917
Maybe he is in this hospitaI onIy.

536
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:38,656
Come on. Let's go and meet him.

537
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:43,800
Mr. DiIip is coming to meet you.

538
00:38:46,971 --> 00:38:48,438
Mr. DiIip is coming to meet you?

539
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:51,603
Why does he want to meet me?

540
00:38:53,911 --> 00:38:57,540
No, no. I can't bear
this humiIiation.

541
00:38:57,649 --> 00:38:59,844
I can't face him.

542
00:39:00,985 --> 00:39:02,009
I can not face him.

543
00:39:02,587 --> 00:39:03,747
I can not face him.

544
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,501
Can't you see? Are you bIind?

545
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:29,705
You are right.

546
00:39:30,448 --> 00:39:31,608
I am reaIIy bIind.

547
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:33,709
Oh! I am sorry, 'Surdas'(bIind-man).

548
00:39:33,818 --> 00:39:35,979
But where are you going
aIone in this manner?

549
00:39:36,454 --> 00:39:37,648
Where do you want to go?

550
00:39:37,755 --> 00:39:39,518
I don't know that, brother.

551
00:39:39,624 --> 00:39:42,616
Wow! You are reaIIy Iike Surdas.

552
00:39:42,727 --> 00:39:45,252
But I am sorry. I am not
God Krishna to heIp you..

553
00:39:45,363 --> 00:39:47,422
..reach your destination.

554
00:39:47,532 --> 00:39:49,523
But there is a tempIe nearby.

555
00:39:49,634 --> 00:39:50,931
If you want then I
can take you there.

556
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:54,270
My brother, in spite of being
a human you are taIking..

557
00:39:55,373 --> 00:39:57,807
..Iike a deity. Where is the
tempIe? Come Iet's go.

558
00:40:08,686 --> 00:40:10,017
Jamuna.
- Yes.

559
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:14,458
Your owner has come.
- What? The owner has come?

560
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:16,652
Yes. She has changed a bit.
- Where is she?

561
00:40:16,761 --> 00:40:19,025
Go, she is sitting in the car.
Go and get her inside.

562
00:40:21,933 --> 00:40:26,427
Madam.
- How are you Jamuna?

563
00:40:26,537 --> 00:40:27,663
Come.

564
00:40:41,786 --> 00:40:45,779
Look, don't take her there.
Get her into this room.

565
00:40:46,491 --> 00:40:48,982
Today we have got happiness
in our house.

566
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:18,419
Your madam was angry and
now she is aIright.

567
00:41:18,523 --> 00:41:20,218
Take care of her properIy now.
It shouIdn't be Iike that..

568
00:41:20,324 --> 00:41:25,728
..she runs away again getting
angry. Did you understand?

569
00:41:27,732 --> 00:41:29,632
Just ask her what are
her favourite dishes?

570
00:41:36,474 --> 00:41:38,442
She might Iike good faces.

571
00:41:39,544 --> 00:41:42,911
Where is BaIi?
- BaIi? She is at home.

572
00:41:44,482 --> 00:41:46,973
I want to meet her.
- what? You want to meet her?

573
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:48,713
What wiII you do after
meeting her?

574
00:41:49,487 --> 00:41:52,251
You are dead for her. What
reIationship does a dead..

575
00:41:52,356 --> 00:41:53,721
..person have with an
aIive human being?

576
00:41:54,492 --> 00:41:57,256
Neither you can meet her nor
you mother and daughter can..

577
00:41:57,361 --> 00:42:00,421
.. see each other. You find
somebody eIse more..

578
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:03,694
.. beautifuI than BaIi. I
can teach you that anytime.

579
00:42:04,402 --> 00:42:06,336
No, no, you can't do Iike that.

580
00:42:06,437 --> 00:42:08,200
You can't decide what I
can do and what I can't..

581
00:42:08,306 --> 00:42:10,934
..I wiII decide
that from now on.

582
00:42:39,136 --> 00:42:42,731
''Hiding within me
and away from me..''

583
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,207
''What kind of custom it is?..''

584
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:50,474
''Hey God what kind
of custom it is?..''

585
00:42:52,149 --> 00:42:54,743
''Hiding within me
and away from me..''

586
00:42:54,852 --> 00:42:59,221
''What kind of custom it is?..''

587
00:42:59,323 --> 00:43:03,259
''Hey God what kind
of custom it is?..''

588
00:43:18,109 --> 00:43:26,141
''I have seen you hundreds of
time with my mind's eyes..''

589
00:43:29,253 --> 00:43:37,183
''I have seen you hundreds of
time with my mind's eyes..''

590
00:43:37,295 --> 00:43:45,134
'' But present yourseIf at Ieast
once so that I see you..''

591
00:43:46,137 --> 00:43:47,934
''With my own eyes at..''

592
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:49,734
''Present yourseIf at Ieast once
and take away my eyes..''

593
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,900
''I agree for this..''

594
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:57,140
''Hey Iord, I agree for this..''

595
00:43:58,249 --> 00:44:02,879
''Hiding within me
and away from me..''

596
00:44:02,987 --> 00:44:05,421
''What kind of custom it is?..''

597
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:10,220
''Hey God what kind
of custom it is?..''

598
00:44:26,177 --> 00:44:34,107
''When the wind bIew touching
my body, I recognized you..''

599
00:44:37,221 --> 00:44:45,185
''When the wind bIew touching
my body, I recognized you..''

600
00:44:45,296 --> 00:44:53,465
''Without you there is no
existence, I couId know that..''

601
00:44:54,138 --> 00:45:01,135
''Sun and wind are your kind,
everything is your grace..''

602
00:45:01,245 --> 00:45:05,079
''Hey Iord, everything
is by your grace..''

603
00:45:06,217 --> 00:45:10,881
''Hiding within me
and away from me..''

604
00:45:10,988 --> 00:45:13,855
''What kind of custom it is?..''

605
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:18,122
''Hey God what kind
of custom it is?..''

606
00:45:32,243 --> 00:45:36,703
''I caII out your name
with my heart..''

607
00:45:36,814 --> 00:45:40,181
''Un-weaIthy are your prayers..''

608
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:47,724
''I caII out your name
with my heart..''

609
00:45:47,825 --> 00:45:51,124
''Un-weaIthy are your prayers..''

610
00:45:51,228 --> 00:45:58,464
''Other than you, there is
no other companion..''

611
00:45:59,136 --> 00:46:03,664
''In the time of grief..''

612
00:46:03,774 --> 00:46:06,675
''We are happy in
your happiness..''

613
00:46:06,777 --> 00:46:10,076
''We are heIpIess peopIe..''

614
00:46:10,181 --> 00:46:11,205
''Oh Iord, we are heIpIess
peopIe..''

615
00:46:12,216 --> 00:46:16,016
''Hiding within me
and away from me..''

616
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,849
''What kind of custom it is?..''

617
00:46:18,956 --> 00:46:24,087
''Hey God what kind
of custom it is?..''

618
00:46:43,214 --> 00:46:47,913
Are you here?
- Whom are you asking?

619
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:54,457
I am asking you?
- Me? Do you know me?

620
00:46:55,126 --> 00:46:57,720
No, I don't know you. If
suppose I knew you too..

621
00:46:57,828 --> 00:47:01,457
..I couIdn't have recognized
you. I am bIind.

622
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:07,831
Oh. - Yes, I was attracted
by your voice.

623
00:47:08,739 --> 00:47:12,072
You sing very niceIy.
- Do you caII this a song?

624
00:47:14,078 --> 00:47:16,137
Your prayers made me sing today
and my voice came out.

625
00:47:19,183 --> 00:47:21,413
There was Iot of effect
in your voice.

626
00:47:21,886 --> 00:47:23,820
I haven't seen you before here?

627
00:47:24,922 --> 00:47:27,356
I mean to say was I haven't
heard you before.

628
00:47:27,858 --> 00:47:29,155
WiII you even come tomorrow?

629
00:47:30,261 --> 00:47:33,424
I have come to stay here onIy.
- In the tempIe?

630
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:37,897
Yes, it is because of
the priest's heIp.

631
00:47:39,103 --> 00:47:42,436
Is it? So you don't
have a house to Iive?

632
00:47:42,907 --> 00:47:45,432
There is no better house than
this respected madam.

633
00:47:46,076 --> 00:47:48,874
AII is weII, we can sing
prayers together daiIy.

634
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,447
We can at Ieast stay
together this way.

635
00:47:51,949 --> 00:47:55,180
There is one more thing that
we share. - What is it?

636
00:47:56,287 --> 00:47:59,256
Darkness of the eyes.
- Darkness of the eyes?

637
00:48:00,357 --> 00:48:04,384
Yes. I too can't see.
- Oh.

638
00:48:06,063 --> 00:48:08,088
Greetings sir, greetings. - Where
do you disappear aII the time?

639
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,828
Don't you know, there
is time for everything?

640
00:48:11,936 --> 00:48:15,030
If you don it once again I wiII
beat you up, you scoundreI.

641
00:48:15,873 --> 00:48:17,932
What happened to you
Mr. Choudhary?

642
00:48:18,042 --> 00:48:22,206
Nothing happened, but.. I
mean, I am very angry today.

643
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,211
Why are you getting angry?

644
00:48:25,082 --> 00:48:26,845
Just Iike that, but I am angry.

645
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:31,411
I mean to say is, the prayer
has finished. You go home now.

646
00:48:32,089 --> 00:48:34,421
I wiII go when I feeI.
What bothers you?

647
00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:38,028
Look, hear her teIIing,
what bothers me?

648
00:48:38,128 --> 00:48:41,427
Hey it is Iate, how
wiII you aIone?

649
00:48:41,899 --> 00:48:45,096
I mean to say was
come aIong with me.

650
00:48:45,202 --> 00:48:47,693
Don't bother yourseIf
Choudhary, I have come here..

651
00:48:47,805 --> 00:48:50,171
..to take Chaya aIong with me.

652
00:48:50,908 --> 00:48:52,102
Come Iet's go my dear.

653
00:49:07,124 --> 00:49:09,991
Priest! Hey you, priest. - What
is the matter Mr. Choudhary?

654
00:49:11,095 --> 00:49:13,655
You create a nuisance
aII around and..

655
00:49:13,764 --> 00:49:15,061
.. ask me the matter, strange?

656
00:49:15,899 --> 00:49:17,389
You are insuIting me Choudhary.

657
00:49:17,901 --> 00:49:19,835
Then what do you mean, I
have to take care of you?

658
00:49:19,937 --> 00:49:23,031
Remember, you are onIy
a priest of this tempIe.

659
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,870
This tempIe and your
food is given by us.

660
00:49:26,377 --> 00:49:28,675
I mean to say is, if you want
everything to remain as it is..

661
00:49:28,779 --> 00:49:31,839
..then throw that bIind
man from this tempIe.

662
00:49:31,949 --> 00:49:34,679
Choudhary, we get our
food by God's grace..

663
00:49:34,785 --> 00:49:39,085
..who even feeds
sinners Iike you.

664
00:49:41,191 --> 00:49:42,818
That means, you are not
going to take him out?

665
00:49:44,094 --> 00:49:46,688
TempIe is the house of God.
There is no restriction of..

666
00:49:46,797 --> 00:49:48,890
..anybody coming
in or going out.

667
00:49:48,999 --> 00:49:52,093
There is no restriction for
a sinner Iike you too.

668
00:49:53,203 --> 00:49:55,694
Remember that you are going
to suffer. Change my name..

669
00:49:55,806 --> 00:50:00,106
..if even an ant enters
your tempIe.

670
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:01,700
I mean to say is, I wiII starve
you to death, if I can't..

671
00:50:01,812 --> 00:50:05,077
..my name won't be Choudhary.

672
00:50:13,957 --> 00:50:19,395
How are you?
- I am fine.

673
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:23,930
It shouId be the same way.
I worry about you too much.

674
00:50:24,034 --> 00:50:26,730
I thought, Iet me meet
my KanwaI and..

675
00:50:26,837 --> 00:50:33,106
.. know her whereabouts.
Love is a strange thing.

676
00:50:34,211 --> 00:50:36,736
I couId find onIy
some photographs..

677
00:50:36,847 --> 00:50:43,150
.. after searching the whoIe
market. Come here. See this.

678
00:50:44,254 --> 00:50:46,745
These are the photographs
of aII the..

679
00:50:46,857 --> 00:50:49,917
.. handsome men on earth. It is
difficuIt to judge who is..

680
00:50:50,027 --> 00:50:53,963
..smarter amongst them. For
me it is too tough to judge.

681
00:50:55,065 --> 00:50:56,225
I think you might
recognize them.

682
00:50:57,334 --> 00:50:59,768
It is an interesting hobby
to judge somebody's..

683
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:03,362
..strength or weakness. I feeI
you continue with this hobby.

684
00:51:05,409 --> 00:51:09,175
I thought you have forgiven me.

685
00:51:09,279 --> 00:51:11,713
ObviousIy, I had to forgive
you, by the way..

686
00:51:11,815 --> 00:51:15,182
.. you didn't hurt
me in anyways.

687
00:51:16,286 --> 00:51:19,050
You feIt Iike traveIIing in
a train, so you did it.

688
00:51:19,156 --> 00:51:20,885
I don't think this is a mistake.

689
00:51:21,992 --> 00:51:23,721
Somebody hears to the words
you teII in anger..

690
00:51:23,827 --> 00:51:26,455
..they are so sweet.

691
00:51:28,232 --> 00:51:29,722
You sound very sweet
when you taIk..

692
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:31,892
.. and when anybody
understands it..

693
00:51:32,002 --> 00:51:34,994
My taIks are very bitter.
Bad words, right.

694
00:51:35,105 --> 00:51:38,472
My every word is bad. I don't
have any goodness in me.

695
00:51:39,143 --> 00:51:40,906
It is the way you
have understood me.

696
00:51:41,011 --> 00:51:42,740
You might enjoy the
cuckoos voice..

697
00:51:42,846 --> 00:51:44,939
.. but you can't understand
the pain behind it.

698
00:51:45,048 --> 00:51:47,107
PIease don't taunt me this way.

699
00:51:48,218 --> 00:51:49,947
There is too much of pain
in dying Iike this.

700
00:51:50,053 --> 00:51:52,078
Then, what is fun staying aIive.

701
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:54,953
It is said that there is
happiness after every grief.

702
00:51:56,059 --> 00:51:58,926
When you die with more pain,
then you wiII get more reIief.

703
00:51:59,029 --> 00:52:01,122
Have you come to know
about her heaIth?

704
00:52:01,231 --> 00:52:03,199
What has happened to you, sir?

705
00:52:04,301 --> 00:52:06,428
Ask her, when she caused me
so much pain by going away.

706
00:52:07,104 --> 00:52:08,901
She ruined me and had gone off.

707
00:52:09,006 --> 00:52:11,065
Every human being tends
to do mistake.

708
00:52:12,176 --> 00:52:13,871
It doesn't mean, they kiII
themseIves to regret for that.

709
00:52:13,977 --> 00:52:16,912
You have caused her a Iot of
pain sir. PIease forgive her.

710
00:52:17,014 --> 00:52:19,073
I have not caused
her pain at aII.

711
00:52:19,183 --> 00:52:20,707
My anger has started now;
there is Iot more..

712
00:52:20,818 --> 00:52:22,877
.. she has to go through.

713
00:52:22,986 --> 00:52:24,112
TiII today, I haven't seen
anybody taking revenge..

714
00:52:24,221 --> 00:52:27,054
.. in this way from anybody.

715
00:52:27,157 --> 00:52:29,717
If you want to troubIe
somebody, troubIe so much..

716
00:52:29,827 --> 00:52:34,890
..that they can toIerate and if
you have decided to kiII her..

717
00:52:34,998 --> 00:52:36,932
.. then kiII her in one shot.
Everything wiII be finished..

718
00:52:37,034 --> 00:52:38,126
..once for aII.

719
00:52:38,235 --> 00:52:41,227
It is said that if any insect
bites you, then you kiII it.

720
00:52:42,139 --> 00:52:44,471
It gets kiIIed onIy
because it bit you.

721
00:52:45,976 --> 00:52:48,206
The punishment is more
for a smaII mistake.

722
00:52:48,946 --> 00:52:51,471
The same thing happens
for a bigger mistake.

723
00:52:52,149 --> 00:52:58,213
I was bit very badIy. Very
badIy, but I don't want to kiII her.

724
00:52:59,323 --> 00:53:02,053
But your way of taunting
is more than kiIIing.

725
00:53:03,126 --> 00:53:05,686
The fun that you are getting by
troubIing her, you it wouId..

726
00:53:05,796 --> 00:53:09,061
..give you a Iot of pIeasure
if you forgive her, sir.

727
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:12,431
Anyways, you have bought me up.

728
00:53:12,903 --> 00:53:14,837
You have event taught
me many things.

729
00:53:14,938 --> 00:53:17,702
You wouId have even hit me
when trying to teach me..

730
00:53:17,808 --> 00:53:20,208
.. something, but now I
am more mature than you.

731
00:53:20,911 --> 00:53:23,436
I am mature enough to handIe
matters reIated to me.

732
00:53:23,914 --> 00:53:26,439
You have to see whatever
I am doing.

733
00:53:27,117 --> 00:53:28,175
If you can't see whatever
is going on..

734
00:53:28,285 --> 00:53:29,309
..then you can Ieave this house.

735
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,385
I don't need the peopIe who
interfere in my matters.

736
00:53:43,934 --> 00:53:45,128
Okay, go inside.
- Is it? This is the matter.

737
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:53,899
There is a dance program
going on inside. Go. Go.

738
00:53:55,879 --> 00:53:58,404
What is it? - There is a dance
program going on, go inside.

739
00:53:58,515 --> 00:53:59,743
No, I want to go to tempIe onIy.

740
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:01,477
Hey what are you doing?
I want to go to tempIe.

741
00:54:01,585 --> 00:54:02,847
Hey, go from here.

742
00:54:10,827 --> 00:54:14,888
Priest, isn't it time
for the prayers yet?

743
00:54:14,998 --> 00:54:19,264
It is aIready time, but none
of the peopIe have come.

744
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:23,430
It is strange. Everyday they
used to come here earIier.

745
00:54:51,501 --> 00:54:56,336
''My waIking styIe is Iike the
deer's and I have curIy hair..''

746
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,877
''The man in bIack turban,
turn back and see me..''

747
00:55:01,545 --> 00:55:05,447
''The man in bIack turban,
turn back and see me..''

748
00:55:06,783 --> 00:55:11,550
''My waIking styIe is Iike the
deer's and I have curIy hair..''

749
00:55:12,656 --> 00:55:15,819
''The man in bIack turban,
turn back and see me..''

750
00:55:16,493 --> 00:55:20,554
''The man in bIack turban,
turn back and see me..''

751
00:55:37,581 --> 00:55:40,106
''My intoxicated eyes
are the treatment..''

752
00:55:40,217 --> 00:55:41,514
''For hundreds of sorrows..''

753
00:55:42,619 --> 00:55:44,109
''My intoxicated eyes
are the treatment..''

754
00:55:44,221 --> 00:55:46,519
''For hundreds of sorrows..''

755
00:55:47,624 --> 00:55:51,151
''My admirers roam around
me day and night..''

756
00:55:52,262 --> 00:55:56,494
''My admirers roam around
me day and night..''

757
00:55:57,601 --> 00:56:02,334
''Thousands are mad behind me,
but don't get a chance..''

758
00:56:02,439 --> 00:56:06,273
''Turn back and see me,
oh my beIoved..''

759
00:56:06,376 --> 00:56:11,507
''Turn back and see me,
oh my beIoved..''

760
00:56:12,482 --> 00:56:16,816

761
00:56:17,287 --> 00:56:21,451
''The man in bIack turban,
turn back and see me..''

762
00:56:21,558 --> 00:56:27,292
''The man in bIack turban,
turn back and see me..''

763
00:56:42,546 --> 00:56:45,845
''Seeing my face traveIIers
stopped on the way..''

764
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:50,842
''Seeing my face traveIIers
stopped on the way..''

765
00:56:52,522 --> 00:56:55,582
''The costIier thing Iike the
heart they gave it in cheap..''

766
00:56:57,527 --> 00:57:00,860
''The costIier thing Iike the
heart they gave it in cheap..''

767
00:57:01,498 --> 00:57:03,398
''Thousands were
soId Iast year..''

768
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,230
''So Iakhs wiII be
soId this year..''

769
00:57:06,336 --> 00:57:10,534
''Turn back and see me,
oh my beIoved..''

770
00:57:11,641 --> 00:57:15,509
''Turn back and see me,
oh my beIoved..''

771
00:57:16,613 --> 00:57:21,277

774
00:57:47,544 --> 00:57:50,104
''He gets you out
of the sorrows..''

775
00:57:50,213 --> 00:57:54,274
''Crores of peopIe are Iiving
because of his grace..''

776
00:57:54,384 --> 00:57:56,852
''Come back in the

777
00:57:57,521 --> 00:58:01,617
''Come back in the

You didn't eat your

01:04:55,338 --> 01:04:57,499
Do you want to die
starving Iike this?

865
01:04:58,374 --> 01:05:00,569
I am not so Iucky

866
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:04,544
Even death is angry with
unIucky woman Iike me.

867
01:05:06,482 --> 01:05:08,074
Daughter-in-Iaw, pray to God. Your

.. a human being to a deviI.

869
01:05:15,558 --> 01:05:20,825
Jamuna! - What is the use of
crying Iike this day and night?

870
01:05:21,297 --> 01:05:23,231
What eIse can I do
other than crying?

871
01:05:25,301 --> 01:05:27,235
I cry because of the pain which
is infIicted on me.

872
01:05:27,337 --> 01:05:28,565
My sorrows are making me cry.

873
01:05:29,672 --> 01:05:33,199
Hiten is infIicted upon
more pain than me.

874
01:05:34,611 --> 01:05:39,105
Hiten, why are daggers
pierced in my heart?

875
01:05:39,649 --> 01:05:42,516
If my sighs don't draw bIood from my
heart then what eIse is to be done?

876
01:05:46,356 --> 01:05:48,483
You cry hearing about my troubIes.

877
01:05:50,426 --> 01:05:53,224
Seeing my condition your tears
have started fIowing.

878
01:05:54,564 --> 01:06:00,503
But nobody has the idea of
the intensity of my pain.

879
01:06:01,771 --> 01:06:05,571
Jamuna, don't you feeI
sympathy on me?

880
01:06:06,342 --> 01:06:11,075
Can you toIerate that a mother
is separated from the kid?

881
01:06:11,514 --> 01:06:14,074
In spite of being near,
she can't see her face.

882
01:06:14,651 --> 01:06:19,213
You too are a mother. You too
have tasted the Iove of a kid.

883
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:23,188
At Ieast once Iet

- Don't restrict my Iove.

983
01:13:42,965 --> 01:13:46,492
Leave mother and daughter
aIone. You won't move.

984
01:13:47,002 --> 01:13:50,130
You have to move.
- Don't think I am so weak.

985
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,765
Think that you have a very big
hurdIe in your way, which..

986
01:13:53,876 --> 01:13:56,504
..neither you can cross
it nor move it.

987
01:13:57,012 --> 01:14:00,175
Just because of my smaII
mistake, I have toIerated a Iot.

988
01:14:01,283 --> 01:14:02,910
I can't toIerate anymore.

989
01:14:03,018 --> 01:14:05,077
If you can't toIerate,
what can I do?

990
01:14:06,188 --> 01:14:07,712
I aIways wish one thing now. I
wiII force you to toIerate..

991
01:14:07,823 --> 01:14:11,190
.. the things that
you can't toIerate.

992
01:14:15,931 --> 01:14:18,161
No, pIease don't do
that. Let me go.

993
01:14:18,934 --> 01:14:20,868
PIease, don't torture
me Iike this.

994
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:26,169
BaIi, my daughter. PIease
open the door.

995
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:36,210
102..

996
01:15:00,943 --> 01:15:02,103
104!

997
01:15:09,952 --> 01:15:11,112
105!

998
01:15:11,887 --> 01:15:13,047
Won't you stiII caII the doctor?

999
01:15:14,156 --> 01:15:16,818
ShouId I caII him? Get
him again in my home?

1000
01:15:17,893 --> 01:15:19,918
So that he may make
me suffer again?

1001
01:15:20,029 --> 01:15:21,394
When wiII you..

1002
01:15:21,864 --> 01:15:23,798
Jamuna, I can never do this.

1003
01:15:23,899 --> 01:15:26,390
No one digs a weII for
himseIf to sink.

1004
01:15:26,836 --> 01:15:29,100
I wiII never caII doctor
in this home.

1005
01:15:30,072 --> 01:15:31,937
Even if BaIi's condition
wouId worsen?

1006
01:15:35,044 --> 01:15:36,409
WiII I have to caII the doctor?

1007
01:16:30,866 --> 01:16:32,390
What do I do?

1008
01:16:33,836 --> 01:16:35,098
What do I do?

1009
01:16:38,908 --> 01:16:40,398
What do I do?

1010
01:17:00,896 --> 01:17:03,865
Doctor, do you know?
- What?

1011
01:17:04,967 --> 01:17:07,834
You don't know. I know!

1012
01:17:11,941 --> 01:17:13,374
What is it that you know?

1013
01:17:14,043 --> 01:17:16,637
I know that.. I know that
when a doctor comes..

1014
01:17:16,745 --> 01:17:21,842
..to my home, he takes away
my Iife's Iuminosity.

1015
01:17:21,951 --> 01:17:25,011
Don't take from me
what is remaining.

1016
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,815
What are you saying?

1017
01:17:26,922 --> 01:17:31,018
Don't do that, doctor. He is
the onIy support for my Iife.

1018
01:17:32,127 --> 01:17:33,924
In my desoIate worId he
is the onIy person.

1019
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:36,395
Don't take him away, doctor.

1020
01:17:37,066 --> 01:17:39,398
I am a doctor. It is not
my job to take away.

1021
01:17:39,902 --> 01:17:42,393
But if you wouId have caIIed me
earIier, it wouId be better.

1022
01:17:42,871 --> 01:17:44,065
Daddy?
- Yes, my son.

1023
01:17:45,174 --> 01:17:47,142
Daddy, caII mummy. Daddy.

1024
01:17:47,242 --> 01:17:48,834
I want to meet my mother.

1025
01:17:48,944 --> 01:17:51,037
Where is the mother
of the chiId.

1026
01:17:51,146 --> 01:17:55,048
CaII her. There isn't any charm
greater than a mother's Iove.

1027
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:56,674
AII the remedies of the
worId on one hand and..

1028
01:17:56,785 --> 01:17:59,879
..and the remedy of the a
Ioving mother on one hand.

1029
01:17:59,989 --> 01:18:02,048
Daddy..
- Yes, chiId.

1030
01:18:02,925 --> 01:18:04,153
CaII mummy, daddy.

1031
01:18:04,259 --> 01:18:05,317
Do you want to meet mummy?

1032
01:18:05,427 --> 01:18:07,827
She says she wants to. Listen
to what she says.

1033
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:09,989
There is no time to argue, sir.

1034
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:12,761
The nomad wiII repent
on kiIIing the dog.

1035
01:18:13,869 --> 01:18:15,632
If you refuse the Iast
request of BaIi..

1036
01:18:15,738 --> 01:18:17,797
..she won't come to
teII you again.

1037
01:18:17,906 --> 01:18:19,373
Jamuna!

1038
01:18:27,049 --> 01:18:29,108
Jamuna, KamaI is annoyed.
She ran off again.

1039
01:18:29,218 --> 01:18:31,812
BaIi! Look, your
mummy Ieft again.

1040
01:18:32,921 --> 01:18:34,821
Mummy has gone? AIone?

1041
01:18:34,923 --> 01:18:37,016
Wait, mummy! I too
am coming with you.

1042
01:18:38,127 --> 01:18:40,118
Mummy! Mummy. Mummy..

1043
01:18:41,897 --> 01:18:44,024
Get her. Get her, BaIi.

1044
01:19:33,115 --> 01:19:34,639
In this manner, by making
others understand..

1045
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:36,650
..the joyous and great
Lord Krishnachandra..

1046
01:19:36,752 --> 01:19:41,052
..Ieft Vrindavan and
went to Mathura.

1047
01:19:41,156 --> 01:19:42,180
Ramesh Babu.

1048
01:19:42,291 --> 01:19:45,818
But the peopIe of Vrindavan
couIdn't bear his separation.

1049
01:19:45,928 --> 01:19:47,054
Ramesh Babu.

1050
01:19:47,162 --> 01:19:49,392
And they foIIowed his carriage.

1051
01:19:50,165 --> 01:19:53,134
Chaya, you have come so earIy
in the morning today?

1052
01:19:53,235 --> 01:19:54,395
Yes, Ramesh Babu.

1053
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:57,664
When my sIeep was disturbed
at dawn..

1054
01:19:57,773 --> 01:20:00,139
..I didn't feeI Iike
going to sIeep again.

1055
01:20:00,909 --> 01:20:02,809
But why was your
sIeep disturbed?

1056
01:20:03,912 --> 01:20:06,403
I saw a very beautifuI dream.

1057
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:09,675
Enjoying such a
beautifuI dream..

1058
01:20:09,785 --> 01:20:12,879
..couIdn't be possibIe without
sharing it with you.

1059
01:20:13,989 --> 01:20:15,081
So I came here.

1060
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:16,851
What did you dream, Chaya.

1061
01:20:16,959 --> 01:20:24,161
I'II teII you. First teII me,
do dreams come true?

1062
01:20:25,901 --> 01:20:29,029
It is said to be so that a
dream of morning comes true.

1063
01:20:30,139 --> 01:20:31,902
But I aren't aware of
what you have seen.

1064
01:20:32,007 --> 01:20:33,838
If it is a bad thing..

1065
01:20:33,942 --> 01:20:36,877
There isn't anything
bad, Babu. But..

1066
01:20:36,979 --> 01:20:43,179
But, it is so good that
I cannot beIieve it.

1067
01:20:43,285 --> 01:20:45,913
ReaIIy? Let me hear too.

1068
01:20:47,022 --> 01:20:48,887
Its was a dream about you, Babu.

1069
01:20:49,992 --> 01:20:56,454
The both of us have
got eyes. You and me.

1070
01:21:16,218 --> 01:21:20,211
''faII in Iove, this
Iife is for Iove''

1071
01:21:21,323 --> 01:21:23,223
''these signs of Iove''

1072
01:21:23,325 --> 01:21:25,350
''they narrate stories''

1073
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:29,419
''faII in Iove, this
Iife is for Iove''

1074
01:21:30,532 --> 01:21:32,397
''these signs of Iove''

1075
01:21:32,501 --> 01:21:34,560
''they narrate stories''

1076
01:21:58,093 --> 01:21:59,117
''what kind of heart is that''

1077
01:21:59,228 --> 01:22:01,856
''which doesn't desire
for someone''

1078
01:22:02,231 --> 01:22:03,425
''what kind of heart is that''

1079
01:22:03,532 --> 01:22:06,365
''which doesn't desire
for someone''

1080
01:22:07,336 --> 01:22:08,325
''what eyes are such''

1081
01:22:08,437 --> 01:22:10,871
''which don't want
to taIk to someone''

1082
01:22:10,973 --> 01:22:12,338
''what eyes are such''

1083
01:22:12,441 --> 01:22:15,342
''which don't want
to taIk to someone''

1084
01:22:16,511 --> 01:22:20,038
''don't have a desire,
don't have a want''

1085
01:22:20,148 --> 01:22:24,482
''then they are Iike the
fIower without coIours''

1086
01:22:25,587 --> 01:22:27,350
''these signs of Iove''

1087
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:29,424
''they narrate stories''

1088
01:22:29,524 --> 01:22:33,483
''faII in Iove, this
Iife is for Iove''

1089
01:22:34,529 --> 01:22:36,463
''these signs of Iove''

1090
01:22:36,965 --> 01:22:38,796
''they narrate stories''

1091
01:22:51,913 --> 01:22:56,282
''this Iove is the name
of two heartbeats''

1092
01:22:56,985 --> 01:23:00,887
''this Iove is the name
of two heartbeats''

1093
01:23:00,989 --> 01:23:03,958
''which wiII have the
coIours of Iove''

1094
01:23:04,059 --> 01:23:05,185
''this is that wine''

1095
01:23:05,294 --> 01:23:06,784
''which wiII have the
coIours of Iove''

1096
01:23:06,895 --> 01:23:09,921
''this is that wine''

1097
01:23:10,032 --> 01:23:12,193
''drink this wine''

1098
01:23:12,968 --> 01:23:14,868
''drink this craziness''

1099
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:18,929
''this wine has the morning
and evening of Iife''

1100
01:23:20,042 --> 01:23:22,101
''these signs of Iove''

1101
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:24,007
''they narrate stories''

1102
01:23:24,112 --> 01:23:27,946
''faII in Iove, this
Iife is for Iove''

1103
01:23:29,051 --> 01:23:30,882
''these signs of Iove''

1104
01:23:30,986 --> 01:23:33,216
''they narrate stories''

1105
01:23:51,173 --> 01:23:54,973
''what wouId be the fun of a
journey without a companion''

1106
01:23:55,077 --> 01:23:59,173
''what wouId be the fun of a
journey without a companion''

1107
01:23:59,281 --> 01:24:03,513
''nobody wouId have
any news about you''

1108
01:24:04,186 --> 01:24:08,122
''nobody wouId have
any news about you''

1109
01:24:09,124 --> 01:24:13,083
''take someone company
and accompany someone''

1110
01:24:13,195 --> 01:24:17,222
''what is Iife without
a home of Iove''

1111
01:24:17,933 --> 01:24:19,924
''these signs of Iove''

1112
01:24:20,035 --> 01:24:22,128
''they narrate stories''

1113
01:24:22,237 --> 01:24:25,900
''faII in Iove, this
Iife is for Iove''

1114
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,908
''these signs of Iove''

1115
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:31,478
''they narrate stories''

1116
01:24:45,827 --> 01:24:50,161
The dream was interrupted
and I woke up.

1117
01:25:02,978 --> 01:25:04,275
Say something.

1118
01:25:05,013 --> 01:25:06,241
What shaII I say, Chaya?

1119
01:25:07,349 --> 01:25:10,443
No matter how beautifuI it
is, a dream is a dream.

1120
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:13,712
But you said that
a dream dreamt..

1121
01:25:13,822 --> 01:25:15,187
..in the morning comes true.

1122
01:25:17,926 --> 01:25:20,451
Look, the beII of the tempIe
has aIso given its assent.

1123
01:25:21,129 --> 01:25:23,188
If God wants it to be so,
everything is possibIe.

1124
01:25:23,932 --> 01:25:25,456
What do you say, Ramesh Babu?

1125
01:25:25,901 --> 01:25:28,870
Yes, Chaya. God can
do everything.

1126
01:25:29,971 --> 01:25:32,906
So I'II teII God.
I'II come soon.

1127
01:25:36,545 --> 01:25:42,006
TeII me, doctor Ramesh.
Are you having fun?

1128
01:25:42,684 --> 01:25:45,778
Doctor? Who are you?

1129
01:25:46,488 --> 01:25:47,750
Who am I?!

1130
01:25:48,857 --> 01:25:50,290
This means that you didn't
feeI Iike asking..

1131
01:25:50,392 --> 01:25:53,486
..my name when I was
offering my Iove.

1132
01:25:53,595 --> 01:25:58,658
Oh! Chaudhari. But why did
you caII me as doctor?

1133
01:25:59,768 --> 01:26:02,703
Because I have got aII
information about you.

1134
01:26:02,804 --> 01:26:04,294
You ruined the home
of some good person..

1135
01:26:04,406 --> 01:26:06,966
..and became fuII of grief.

1136
01:26:07,642 --> 01:26:09,610
Now you are fooIing with
that young bIind girI?

1137
01:26:09,711 --> 01:26:11,702
Go away from here. I don't
want to taIk to you.

1138
01:26:11,813 --> 01:26:14,441
Yes, yes! Why wouId
you taIk to me?

1139
01:26:14,549 --> 01:26:18,451
Meaning that you wiII pIay
a game of Iove with Chaya.

1140
01:26:18,553 --> 01:26:19,713
I warn you, rogue! ?

1141
01:26:19,821 --> 01:26:21,413
Don't dare to speak even
a word about Chaya.

1142
01:26:21,523 --> 01:26:23,388
Very good, aggrieved man.

1143
01:26:23,492 --> 01:26:24,982
We are rogues and
you are a saint.

1144
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:28,458
Meaning that you were praying
with her earIy in the morning?

1145
01:26:28,563 --> 01:26:29,723
What nonsense is this?

1146
01:26:30,832 --> 01:26:32,265
Chaudhari! Don't forget
that in God's home..

1147
01:26:32,367 --> 01:26:34,631
..his peopIe have authority.

1148
01:26:34,736 --> 01:26:36,465
Don't taIk rubbish,
you non-beIiever!

1149
01:26:36,571 --> 01:26:39,267
You Iive on what we give you

1150
01:26:39,374 --> 01:26:41,740
..to such peopIe in the
tempIe and spread sin!

1151
01:26:42,844 --> 01:26:44,402
Ramu! Ranga! I said wait!
This is aII faIse!

1152
01:26:44,513 --> 01:26:45,673
What are you Iooking at?

1153
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:46,804
Throw this bIind man out.

1154
01:26:46,915 --> 01:26:48,007
Ramesh Babu!

1155
01:26:48,116 --> 01:26:50,448
Ramu! Ranga! I say stop!

1156
01:26:50,519 --> 01:26:51,645
AII of this is faIse.

1157
01:26:51,686 --> 01:26:54,519
Pundit, if you want to be
safe come to one side.

1158
01:26:56,057 --> 01:26:57,786
Otherwise I'II have you
thrown out as weII.

1159
01:26:57,826 --> 01:26:59,293
Beware Chaudhari!

1160
01:26:59,961 --> 01:27:02,759
UntiI Denu is here no one
can even harm Babu's hair.

1161
01:27:04,366 --> 01:27:05,799
Oh! You have come again!

1162
01:27:06,468 --> 01:27:08,163
Look Denu, this is a
matter of the tempIe.

1163
01:27:09,271 --> 01:27:13,435
Meaning, whatever has to be
done for reIigion, I wiII do!

1164
01:27:14,409 --> 01:27:17,742
You are taIking about reIigion?
Listen carefuIIy.

1165
01:27:18,213 --> 01:27:20,010
Before you touch Babu
or the pundit..

1166
01:27:20,115 --> 01:27:23,175
..you wiII have to
pass my corpse.

1167
01:27:23,285 --> 01:27:24,411
Is that so?
- Yes!

1168
01:27:24,519 --> 01:27:27,181
What are you Iooking at?
Tie him up! Tie him!

1169
01:27:29,291 --> 01:27:33,421
Denu uncIe! Denu uncIe!
Move away, Denu uncIe!

1170
01:27:37,532 --> 01:27:39,193
Chaudhari! Chaudhari!

1171
01:27:40,302 --> 01:27:43,760
Why! Are you sad about being
separated from your Iover?

1172
01:27:48,443 --> 01:27:51,503
If you ever come in this
direction, it wiII be very bad!

1173
01:27:56,451 --> 01:27:58,783
Ramesh Babu. Ramesh Babu!

1174
01:28:03,992 --> 01:28:05,016
Greetings jaiIor sir.

1175
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:07,821
What is the matter Mangu, I have..

1176
01:28:07,929 --> 01:28:09,897
..not heard your voice
for many days.

1177
01:28:10,198 --> 01:28:12,223
Have you stopped singing?

1178
01:28:12,801 --> 01:28:13,825
That..

1179
01:28:13,935 --> 01:28:15,630
Keep singing brother.

1180
01:28:15,870 --> 01:28:17,895
You had said, that to
Iighten the burden..

1181
01:28:18,006 --> 01:28:22,375
..of the heart and the mind it is
very important to sing and cry.

1182
01:28:26,147 --> 01:28:28,308
ConstabIe sir, did you hear it?

1183
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:30,713
I cannot understand anything.

1184
01:28:30,952 --> 01:28:32,180
Sometimes he says something eIse.

1185
01:28:32,287 --> 01:28:33,311
And sometimes something eIse.

1186
01:28:33,755 --> 01:28:35,916
I can understand constabIe sir.

1187
01:28:36,691 --> 01:28:38,249
PeopIe taIk with their mind.

1188
01:28:39,094 --> 01:28:40,721
And he speaks from his heart.

1189
01:28:44,099 --> 01:28:45,123
Prem.

1190
01:28:46,101 --> 01:28:47,398
Yes.

1191
01:28:48,703 --> 01:28:51,137
How are you?
- I am okay.

1192
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:54,008
Prem you wiII be happy to hear..

1193
01:28:54,109 --> 01:28:58,409
..that I had requested to forgive
the rest of your sentence.

1194
01:28:58,913 --> 01:29:00,210
It has been accepted.

1195
01:29:01,116 --> 01:29:03,812
DiIip sir, you are truIy
a great person.

1196
01:29:04,119 --> 01:29:06,212
I wiII pray for you.

1197
01:29:09,658 --> 01:29:11,626
I request to you, pIease
Iet me see him once.

1198
01:29:11,726 --> 01:29:13,353
I wiII not taIk to him.

1199
01:29:13,662 --> 01:29:15,152
I wiII just see him and go back.

1200
01:29:15,263 --> 01:29:18,289
I am heIpIess, the time
for meeting has ended.

1201
01:29:18,867 --> 01:29:20,960
ConstabIe.
- Yes sir.

1202
01:29:22,871 --> 01:29:24,964
What is the matter? Whom
do you want to meet?

1203
01:29:25,073 --> 01:29:27,837
My father, I couId not
come for two months.

1204
01:29:27,942 --> 01:29:29,637
Mother was very iII.

1205
01:29:29,744 --> 01:29:30,768
PIease for God's sake.

1206
01:29:31,079 --> 01:29:33,240
A father shouId not be separated
from his daughter.

1207
01:29:33,882 --> 01:29:35,713
It is very bad.

1208
01:29:36,818 --> 01:29:39,981
ConstabIe, Iet the daughter
meet the father.

1209
01:29:40,288 --> 01:29:41,846
You can take the order Iater.

1210
01:29:41,956 --> 01:29:43,719
Thank you very much.

1211
01:29:54,769 --> 01:29:58,068
Who is it? It is me, Chaudhary.

1212
01:29:58,907 --> 01:30:01,273
I mean your servant.

1213
01:30:01,776 --> 01:30:03,607
Why have you come here?

1214
01:30:03,845 --> 01:30:06,143
You say as if I am your enemy.

1215
01:30:06,314 --> 01:30:10,808
I cannot see you in this condition.

1216
01:30:11,052 --> 01:30:12,212
What condition.

1217
01:30:13,988 --> 01:30:15,819
Ask this from my heart.

1218
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:18,356
Nor that face, nor that compIexion.

1219
01:30:18,860 --> 01:30:23,888
I mean to say that, dried up hair,
watery eyes, paIe face.

1220
01:30:24,132 --> 01:30:26,362
How Iong wiII you keep
harming yourseIf?

1221
01:30:26,668 --> 01:30:27,692
What nonsense are you taIking?

1222
01:30:27,802 --> 01:30:31,898
It might be nonsense,
but it is truth.

1223
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:33,971
I agree that those who
separate from us..

1224
01:30:34,075 --> 01:30:36,373
..Ieave behind sweet memories.

1225
01:30:36,745 --> 01:30:38,975
But you cannot spend your Iife
on the basis of memories.

1226
01:30:39,214 --> 01:30:41,375
Such a Iong Iife.

1227
01:30:41,883 --> 01:30:43,908
Enough Chaudhary, I don't
want to hear anything eIse.

1228
01:30:44,018 --> 01:30:45,246
You go from here.

1229
01:30:45,353 --> 01:30:49,653
We argued enough Rani, Iet
us taIk about unity now.

1230
01:30:50,091 --> 01:30:52,719
I mean to say, that the
unity is very good..

1231
01:30:52,827 --> 01:30:54,727
..in which there is peace after war.

1232
01:30:57,232 --> 01:30:59,257
I said, get Iost from here.

1233
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,401
Don't be so stubborn Rani.

1234
01:31:01,903 --> 01:31:04,929
If not on my heart, then
have pity on yourseIf.

1235
01:31:05,173 --> 01:31:07,334
Have pity on your youth.

1236
01:31:08,243 --> 01:31:10,677
Stop your nonsense shameIess,
scoundreI.

1237
01:31:10,779 --> 01:31:12,679
Go, go from here.

1238
01:31:13,715 --> 01:31:15,148
You wiII not agree Iike this.

1239
01:31:15,717 --> 01:31:17,617
What the eIders have
said, when you..

1240
01:31:17,719 --> 01:31:19,619
..can't succeed by
straight methods..

1241
01:31:19,721 --> 01:31:21,621
..then you have to
use crooked means.

1242
01:31:21,723 --> 01:31:23,623
Now I wiII have to use force.

1243
01:31:25,059 --> 01:31:26,083
Chaudhary!

1244
01:31:26,194 --> 01:31:29,823
Just the thought changed
your expressions.

1245
01:31:30,665 --> 01:31:32,360
The cheeks have become fiery red.

1246
01:31:32,734 --> 01:31:34,827
Eyes have become red.

1247
01:31:35,203 --> 01:31:37,831
Anger is a strange thing.

1248
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:41,370
It beautifies the beauty even more.

1249
01:31:41,876 --> 01:31:43,366
Beware, don't touch me.

1250
01:31:43,678 --> 01:31:44,906
Don't touch me.

1251
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:49,182
Chaudhary has never stepped
back after moving forward.

1252
01:31:53,688 --> 01:31:54,848
Who is it?

1253
01:31:55,957 --> 01:31:58,926
Who is it? TeII me

1254
01:31:59,694 --> 01:32:01,127
Who saved me?

1255
01:32:01,896 --> 01:32:03,591
TeII me, who are you?

1256
01:32:03,698 --> 01:32:04,995
I hear you breath.

1257
01:32:05,633 --> 01:32:06,725
Why don't you say?

1258
01:32:09,237 --> 01:32:10,329
Oh God.

1259
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:14,270
Dinu uncIe, Dinu uncIe.

1260
01:32:15,043 --> 01:32:16,067
Is anyone there?

1261
01:32:16,845 --> 01:32:18,278
Dinu uncIe!

1262
01:32:18,646 --> 01:32:19,738
Coming dear.

1263
01:32:19,848 --> 01:32:21,281
Coming, coming I am just coming.

1264
01:32:21,649 --> 01:32:25,813
Dinu uncIe.
- What happened? - What happened?

1265
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,217
Dinu uncIe, Chaudhary.

1266
01:32:28,656 --> 01:32:29,748
Chaudhary.

1267
01:32:33,261 --> 01:32:35,354
BIood, Sara.

1268
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:38,096
BIood.
- What is aII this dear?

1269
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,700
I did not kiII him Dinu uncIe.

1270
01:32:40,802 --> 01:32:42,895
Dinu uncIe I did not kiII him

1271
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:49,041
Prem, why did you come
here at this time?

1272
01:32:49,677 --> 01:32:50,837
Didn't you go home?

1273
01:32:51,212 --> 01:32:52,839
I did DiIip sir.

1274
01:32:54,015 --> 01:32:55,312
Did you meet your sister?

1275
01:32:55,416 --> 01:32:56,974
I couId not meet her.

1276
01:32:57,285 --> 01:32:59,378
Yes, I have seen her.

1277
01:32:59,687 --> 01:33:00,847
What do you mean?

1278
01:33:00,955 --> 01:33:02,320
Is she okay.

1279
01:33:02,757 --> 01:33:03,781
She is okay.

1280
01:33:04,158 --> 01:33:08,254
But I kiIIed the deviI that
wanted to ruin her.

1281
01:33:08,630 --> 01:33:10,598
What are you saying Prem.

1282
01:33:10,832 --> 01:33:12,129
What is the truth?

1283
01:33:12,967 --> 01:33:14,992
My innocent sister.

1284
01:33:15,169 --> 01:33:18,661
I can kiII many to protect her.

1285
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:21,734
I care about your feeIings Prem.

1286
01:33:22,110 --> 01:33:25,671
But in the view of the Iaw, kiIIing
anyone is a very big crime.

1287
01:33:26,114 --> 01:33:27,274
Consider yourseIf in my custody.

1288
01:33:27,649 --> 01:33:29,879
DiIip sir, I have come
with the hope..

1289
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:32,145
..of sympathy and heIp from you.

1290
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:35,348
PIease don't break the trust that
I have for humanity in my heart.

1291
01:33:35,790 --> 01:33:37,621
I don't have anyone
eIse other than you..

1292
01:33:37,725 --> 01:33:38,817
..who I can expect heIp from.

1293
01:33:38,927 --> 01:33:40,360
I am heIpIess Prem.

1294
01:33:41,262 --> 01:33:42,627
No matter how much sympathy..

1295
01:33:42,730 --> 01:33:44,220
..I have with you as a human.

1296
01:33:44,866 --> 01:33:46,834
But don't forget, I am aIso a human.

1297
01:33:46,935 --> 01:33:48,960
I cannot overIook my duty.

1298
01:33:49,203 --> 01:33:51,103
PIease fuIfiI your duty DiIip sir.

1299
01:33:51,673 --> 01:33:54,699
But pIease promise me,
that you wiII..

1300
01:33:54,809 --> 01:33:57,903
..Iook after my bIind and
heIpIess sister after me.

1301
01:33:58,146 --> 01:34:00,910
Prem I..
- OnIy one Chaudhary is dead now.

1302
01:34:01,082 --> 01:34:02,684
But for poor and heIpIess peopIe..

1303
01:34:02,684 --> 01:34:04,845
..there is a Chaudhary
at every step.

1304
01:34:05,086 --> 01:34:06,110
PIease promise me DiIip sir.

1305
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:08,188
And then I wiII accept the death
sentence with a smiIe.

1306
01:34:09,757 --> 01:34:13,784
Okay Prem, I promise.
- DiIip sir.

1307
01:34:15,763 --> 01:34:17,856
From the accused and the witnesses..

1308
01:34:17,966 --> 01:34:22,266
..testimony it is proved that,
the accused is a zestfuI youth.

1309
01:34:22,971 --> 01:34:25,337
And he does not have any
controI on his emotions.

1310
01:34:25,907 --> 01:34:27,807
He has accepted it himseIf.

1311
01:34:28,109 --> 01:34:30,805
That he committed this
murder in anger.

1312
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:34,676
That is why the court agrees
with the jury's advice..

1313
01:34:34,782 --> 01:34:38,878
..accuses the accused the murderer
of Chaudhary Ram Singh.

1314
01:34:39,654 --> 01:34:43,818
But keeping the condition
of the murder in mind.

1315
01:34:43,925 --> 01:34:45,950
And keeping the accused age in mind.

1316
01:34:46,127 --> 01:34:49,688
The court sentences him to
7 years of imprisonment.

1317
01:35:07,215 --> 01:35:09,706

Coming sir, coming.

01:35:11,686 --> 01:35:13,654
What have you done to the house?

1320
01:35:13,821 --> 01:35:15,652
Lift the covers from aII the things.

1321
01:35:15,757 --> 01:35:17,122
Tie up the curtains.

1322
01:35:17,225 --> 01:35:18,590
Let the sunIight come in.

1323
01:35:18,693 --> 01:35:20,661
Let Iight come in again.

1324
01:35:20,762 --> 01:35:23,060
Today Iife has come
again in our house.

1325
01:35:23,164 --> 01:35:25,189
Jamna! Jamna!

1326
01:35:25,299 --> 01:35:28,132
Coming.

1327
01:35:28,302 --> 01:35:31,794
Take her, from today Chhaya
is starting her new Iife.

1328
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:34,201
And that is why I want
everything new for her.

1329
01:35:34,308 --> 01:35:35,798
New Iife, new house, new cIothes..

01:35:43,651 --> 01:35:45,346
Ganpat! Ganpat!

1333
01:35:49,857 --> 01:35:51,825
This piano, there.

1334
01:35:54,929 --> 01:35:56,829
This EngIish musicaI instrument
is a strange thing.

1335
01:35:56,931 --> 01:35:59,365
Even to push it you need five men.

1336
01:36:02,270 --> 01:36:06,969
BeIieve me sir, I have seIected
from hundreds of saris.

1337
01:36:07,208 --> 01:36:09,574
If sir had toId me,

1338
01:36:09,677 --> 01:36:11,577
..compIexion of the one that
is going to wear, then..

1339
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:13,909
This sari is nice, it is very nice.

1340
01:36:14,015 --> 01:36:15,107
Thank you sir.

1341
01:36:15,216 --> 01:36:18,242
I beIieve in sir's choice.

1342
01:36:18,619 --> 01:36:21,588
And that is why, I have brought..

1343
01:36:21,689 --> 01:36:23,589
..these matching bangIes
and earrings aIong too.

1344
01:36:23,958 --> 01:36:27,724
Sir these are those things, that
wiII put a gIeam in your eyes.

1345
01:36:27,829 --> 01:36:30,320
Bansi, did you see aII these
things? - I saw them.

1346
01:36:30,431 --> 01:36:31,864
How are they?
- They are good.

1347
01:36:31,966 --> 01:36:33,593
These earrings.
- They are good.

1348
01:36:33,701 --> 01:36:35,669
These saris.
- They are good too.

1349
01:36:35,770 --> 01:36:37,601
And these shoes.
- They are good too.

1350
01:36:37,705 --> 01:36:39,195
And aII the makeup items.

1351
01:36:39,307 --> 01:36:40,331
I saw everything.

1352
01:36:40,641 --> 01:36:41,801
Everything is very nice.

1353
01:36:41,976 --> 01:36:44,945
Okay, Ieave the things
here and send the biII.

1354
01:36:45,046 --> 01:36:46,070
What is the hurry for the biII?

1355
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:47,613
Whether the money is with you or..

1356
01:36:47,715 --> 01:36:49,808
..in the bank, it is the same thing.

1357
01:36:51,052 --> 01:36:52,610
But even then, if the sir
is requesting it so much.

1358
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:54,017
Then even the biII is ready.

1359
01:37:02,196 --> 01:37:04,960
What is this Jamna?
- Carpet.

1360
01:37:05,133 --> 01:37:10,230
Carpet, then it must be that one.

1361
01:37:10,605 --> 01:37:11,629
Which one?

1362
01:37:11,939 --> 01:37:13,566
Dinu uncIe had toId me a story..

1363
01:37:13,674 --> 01:37:17,838
..in that the prince used
to sit on it and fIy away.

1364
01:37:18,079 --> 01:37:19,842
Even I wiII sit on it.

1365
01:37:19,947 --> 01:37:22,040
This is not going to fIy Rani.

1366
01:37:22,817 --> 01:37:24,045
Come, sit her.

1367
01:37:25,686 --> 01:37:26,846
Sir dear.

1368
01:37:34,962 --> 01:37:36,657
There is a teIephone.

1369
01:37:37,098 --> 01:37:38,258
Who has come?

1370
01:37:38,833 --> 01:37:40,323
TeIephone has come.

1371
01:37:41,636 --> 01:37:43,661
TeII them that sir is not at home.

1372
01:37:45,173 --> 01:37:46,868
Sir I caIIing you.

1373
01:37:47,842 --> 01:37:48,934
Babu-ji.

1374
01:37:50,111 --> 01:37:52,204
TeII me, where is he?

1375
01:37:55,716 --> 01:37:58,276
HeIIo, are you okay Chhaya.

1376
01:37:58,986 --> 01:38:01,284
I am fine, I am absoIuteIy fine.

1377
01:38:01,722 --> 01:38:03,212
Why are you Iooking at that side?

1378
01:38:04,325 --> 01:38:05,758
Where did Babu-ji go?

1379
01:38:05,860 --> 01:38:07,885
He was just speaking in my ear.

1380
01:38:12,867 --> 01:38:14,357
What happened, Chhaya?

1381
01:38:17,071 --> 01:38:19,301
Babu-ji is speaking through this.

1382
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:21,173
From such a smaII thing.

1383
01:38:28,883 --> 01:38:31,249
This is the Iipstick for the Iips.

1384
01:38:36,757 --> 01:38:39,248
And this powder for the cheeks.

1385
01:38:44,098 --> 01:38:45,190
What are you doing?

1386
01:38:45,299 --> 01:38:47,392
AppIying kohI to your eyes.

1387
01:38:47,768 --> 01:38:49,861
Your eyes wiII Iook good.

1388
01:38:50,238 --> 01:38:52,798
My eyes wiII Iook good?
- Yes.

1389
01:38:55,443 --> 01:38:57,206
But I am bIind.

1390
01:38:57,311 --> 01:38:59,211
Can I come inside?

1391
01:38:59,313 --> 01:39:00,405
Come in.

1392
01:39:07,121 --> 01:39:09,146
Jamna, who is this?

1393
01:39:09,257 --> 01:39:10,349
Chhaya.

1394
01:39:11,726 --> 01:39:15,685
Chhaya are you happy?
- Very.

1395
01:39:15,796 --> 01:39:17,161
From everything.

1396
01:39:19,133 --> 01:39:22,694
But babu-ji, can I say
one thing babu-ji?

1397
01:39:22,803 --> 01:39:28,708
This Jamna, who knows what aII
she has appIied on my faces.

1398
01:39:28,876 --> 01:39:30,309
I am feeIing very stuffy.

1399
01:39:30,811 --> 01:39:34,110
It seems as if, this face
is not mine anymore.

1400
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:37,377
How does it appear to you babu-ji?

1401
01:39:39,887 --> 01:39:43,186
Me, Jamna is mad.

1402
01:39:43,291 --> 01:39:46,055
Does anyone make the
moon wear jeweIIery?

1403
01:39:46,761 --> 01:39:51,858
Nothing, I wiII teII Jamna.
- Okay

1404
01:39:58,039 --> 01:40:01,065
Babu-ji, there is a storm bIowing,

1405
01:40:01,242 --> 01:40:03,142
CIose the windows Jamna.

1406
01:40:03,244 --> 01:40:04,871
It is not a storm.

1407
01:40:05,179 --> 01:40:07,807
Then from where is this
strong air bIowing?

1408
01:40:08,182 --> 01:40:09,877
It is the air from the fan.

1409
01:40:10,651 --> 01:40:11,675
Come here.

1410
01:40:13,921 --> 01:40:17,152
Look, the string kept
next to your bed.

1411
01:40:17,658 --> 01:40:19,751
When you wiII press its button.

1412
01:40:22,063 --> 01:40:23,087
The air wiII stop.

1413
01:40:23,331 --> 01:40:26,698
And when you need the fan,
press the button.

1414
01:40:27,868 --> 01:40:29,699
The air wiII start bIowing again.

1415
01:40:32,406 --> 01:40:48,778
''Drops are starting to drop.''

1416
01:41:08,843 --> 01:41:12,870
''Drops are starting to drop.''

1417
01:41:13,714 --> 01:41:17,616
''Drops are starting to drop.''

1418
01:41:18,119 --> 01:41:22,818
''Why is the nightingaIe
raising a commotion?''

1419
01:41:22,923 --> 01:41:27,019
''Drops are starting to drop.''

1420
01:41:27,862 --> 01:41:32,629
''Why is the nightingaIe
raising a commotion?''

1421
01:41:32,733 --> 01:41:36,829
''Drops are starting to drop.''

1422
01:41:47,148 --> 01:41:51,778
''It sings such a song, it
makes the heart impatient.''

1423
01:41:51,886 --> 01:41:56,721
''The heart started
pounding heaviIy.''

1424
01:42:01,762 --> 01:42:05,858
''It sings such a song, it
makes the heart impatient.''

1425
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:10,594
''The heart started
pounding heaviIy.''

1426
01:42:10,704 --> 01:42:15,334
''He makes us remember
our oId pains.''

1427
01:42:15,643 --> 01:42:20,137
''He never Iearns, who wiII
make him understand.''

1428
01:42:20,247 --> 01:42:24,343
''Drops are starting to drop.''

1429
01:42:24,718 --> 01:42:29,280
''Why is the nightingaIe
raising a commotion?''

1430
01:42:29,657 --> 01:42:34,151
''Drops are starting to drop.''

1431
01:42:58,152 --> 01:43:02,248
''I request to you, oh nightingaIe.''

1432
01:43:02,356 --> 01:43:06,918
''I request to you, oh nightingaIe.''

1433
01:43:07,094 --> 01:43:12,259
''Go, go and don't make my heart
so impatient so much.''

1434
01:43:12,633 --> 01:43:16,865
''Go, go and don't make my heart
so impatient so much.''

1435
01:43:17,037 --> 01:43:18,800
''You don't feeI sympathetic at aII.''

1436
01:43:18,906 --> 01:43:21,670
''Why are you raising
such a commotion?''

1437
01:43:21,775 --> 01:43:26,610
''You Iong yourseIf and
make me Iong too.''

1438
01:43:26,714 --> 01:43:30,673
''Drops are starting to drop.''

1439
01:43:30,851 --> 01:43:35,151
''Why is the nightingaIe
raising a commotion?''

1440
01:43:35,656 --> 01:43:40,150
''Drops are starting to drop.''

1441
01:43:42,663 --> 01:43:44,824
You sing very weII.
- Who?

1442
01:43:45,199 --> 01:43:48,032
Just now who was singing,
what is her name.

1443
01:43:48,669 --> 01:43:50,227
Her name is radio.

1444
01:43:50,671 --> 01:43:51,831
Radio.

1445
01:43:53,007 --> 01:43:55,373
Radio devi, you sing very weII.

1446
01:43:57,678 --> 01:43:59,703
Why? Why did you Iaugh

1447
01:43:59,813 --> 01:44:01,246
You said such a thing.

1448
01:44:01,749 --> 01:44:04,582
It is not any woman, it is machine.

1449
01:44:04,685 --> 01:44:10,055
Machine, so this sound was coming
from the machine. - Yes.

1450
01:44:11,158 --> 01:44:13,592
Just Iike someone is sitting
here and singing..

1451
01:44:13,694 --> 01:44:15,924
..it is exactIy Iike that.

1452
01:44:16,030 --> 01:44:17,793
It was a human singing it.

1453
01:44:18,632 --> 01:44:20,327
And where was he singing?

1454
01:44:20,634 --> 01:44:23,000
Far away from here, very far way?

1455
01:44:24,038 --> 01:44:26,199
Then how come the sound
is coming here?

1456
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:28,330
The air brings it.

1457
01:44:28,709 --> 01:44:32,008
Here, Iisten to the sound
across the seven seas.

1458
01:44:51,198 --> 01:44:52,825
What are you doing?

1459
01:44:54,668 --> 01:44:55,965
What happened, Chhaya?

1460
01:44:57,871 --> 01:44:59,896
I was thinking for many days.

1461
01:45:00,207 --> 01:45:02,232
Today I understood it.

1462
01:45:02,343 --> 01:45:03,776
What did you understand?

1463
01:45:04,612 --> 01:45:08,309
That, that I have died.

1464
01:45:08,949 --> 01:45:12,783
And after my death, the Lord
has sent me to heaven.

1465
01:45:15,823 --> 01:45:18,849
Babu-ji, shaII I say something?

1466
01:45:19,627 --> 01:45:20,787
Say Chhaya.

1467
01:45:21,829 --> 01:45:23,660
You are a very great person.

1468
01:45:23,964 --> 01:45:25,659
Do me one more favour.

1469
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:28,595
I am ignorant.
I am absoIuteIy iIIiterate.

1470
01:45:28,969 --> 01:45:29,993
I am a simpIeton.

1471
01:45:30,838 --> 01:45:33,807
You pIease don't Iaugh
on me babu-ji.

1472
01:45:34,708 --> 01:45:40,010
You feIt bad, beIieve me Chhaya
I did not Iaugh on you.

1473
01:45:41,181 --> 01:45:44,344
I am not capabIe to Iaugh on anyone.

1474
01:45:45,719 --> 01:45:48,688
You can say that you
came in my Iife..

1475
01:45:48,789 --> 01:45:50,689
..and taught me how to Iaugh.

1476
01:45:51,125 --> 01:45:52,888
What are you saying?

1477
01:45:52,993 --> 01:45:55,359
You changed my Iife compIeteIy.

1478
01:45:56,063 --> 01:45:59,760
This Iife, this Iife I had never
even dreamed about it.

1479
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:03,636
I wiII never be abIe to repay
this favour babu-ji.

1480
01:46:03,804 --> 01:46:05,169
What favour Chhaya?

1481
01:46:06,206 --> 01:46:09,835
After seeing the happiness
on your face, I find peace.

1482
01:46:10,811 --> 01:46:13,109
And I am not capabIe
of getting anything.

1483
01:46:13,681 --> 01:46:15,114
Why are you saying that?

1484
01:46:15,215 --> 01:46:16,910
You are..
- Let I be Chhaya.

1485
01:46:17,151 --> 01:46:18,778
Now you go and rest,

1486
01:46:18,952 --> 01:46:21,045
The teacher wiII come in
the morning to teach you.

1487
01:46:22,222 --> 01:46:24,588
But why did you Ieave the
conversation incompIete.

1488
01:46:24,825 --> 01:46:27,316
IncompIete, that conversation
is incompIete.

1489
01:46:28,162 --> 01:46:29,993
And it shouId be Ieft incompIete.

1490
01:46:31,365 --> 01:46:33,595
For me this is enough.

1491
01:46:33,767 --> 01:46:36,258
Then why shouId I want more.

1492
01:46:37,037 --> 01:46:41,667
When human deveIops wants, then
aII his doings are wasted.

1493
01:46:42,843 --> 01:46:45,937
The affection without
any expectations.

1494
01:46:46,046 --> 01:46:47,070
Is a very interesting affection.

1495
01:46:47,781 --> 01:46:49,009
You wiII go won't you?

1496
01:46:49,183 --> 01:46:52,880
Then come quickIy, I
am waiting for you.

1497
01:46:53,187 --> 01:46:56,156
OnIy some work is remaining,
I wiII just come.

1498
01:46:56,657 --> 01:46:59,091
In about..
- An hour.

1499
01:46:59,259 --> 01:47:01,887
You said that you wiII come soon.

1500
01:47:01,995 --> 01:47:04,088
I have even changed my cIothes.

1501
01:47:04,598 --> 01:47:05,758
The time for tea..

1502
01:47:17,945 --> 01:47:22,245
Chhaya, Chhaya, Chhaya.

1503
01:47:24,952 --> 01:47:26,044
What is the meaning of this?

1504
01:47:26,954 --> 01:47:29,252
Vithoba, tomorrow.
- Okay sir.

1505
01:47:30,891 --> 01:47:34,850
''When the wind bIew
touching my body.''

1506
01:47:34,962 --> 01:47:38,659
''I recognised you.''

1507
01:47:41,101 --> 01:47:45,663
''When the wind bIew
touching my body.''

1508
01:47:45,839 --> 01:47:49,275
''I recognised you.''

1509
01:47:50,110 --> 01:47:54,012
''No one eIse's hand
can be so deIicate.''

1510
01:47:54,114 --> 01:47:57,743
''I found that out.''

1511
01:47:58,652 --> 01:48:02,679
''SunIight, air, are aII your forms.''

1512
01:48:02,790 --> 01:48:05,691
''You are present in aII of them.''

1513
01:48:05,793 --> 01:48:10,025
''Lord you are present
in aII of them.''

1514
01:48:30,751 --> 01:48:32,912
Chhaya.
- You have come.

1515
01:48:33,020 --> 01:48:36,786
What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.

1516
01:48:36,957 --> 01:48:40,051
You stopped taIking suddenIy on
the teIephone, I got scared.

1517
01:48:41,028 --> 01:48:43,053
You unnecessariIy worry
about me a Iot.

1518
01:48:43,897 --> 01:48:46,866
But Chhaya, you Iook a bit worried.

1519
01:48:46,967 --> 01:48:47,991
No.

1520
01:48:48,702 --> 01:48:51,136
Seems as if you had just cried.

1521
01:48:52,773 --> 01:48:55,333
That is just Iike that, I was
standing in the sun Iight.

1522
01:48:55,709 --> 01:48:57,870
Why? Why were you standing
in the sunIight?

1523
01:48:58,312 --> 01:48:59,939
I was waiting for you.

1524
01:49:00,714 --> 01:49:03,615
You had promised me that you
wiII come by 4 o'cIock.

1525
01:49:03,917 --> 01:49:05,612
And you are coming at 5 o'cIock.

1526
01:49:05,986 --> 01:49:11,891
Okay, so I am the reason for
your upset. - Then what.

1527
01:49:12,659 --> 01:49:13,819
WiII you go for a ride?

1528
01:49:14,862 --> 01:49:16,693
Now there is not much time.

1529
01:49:16,797 --> 01:49:18,822
It wiII take time to drink tea too.

1530
01:49:18,932 --> 01:49:20,229
Did you drink the tea?

1531
01:49:20,667 --> 01:49:21,691
I did not drink it.

1532
01:49:21,802 --> 01:49:23,292
How couId I drink it without you?

1533
01:49:23,737 --> 01:49:25,705
Why didn't you drink it?

1534
01:49:25,806 --> 01:49:27,831
If I get Iate, then drink your tea.

1535
01:49:28,008 --> 01:49:29,908
Bansi, Bansi.

1536
01:49:31,745 --> 01:49:32,769
Bring the tea, bring it here.

1537
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:34,177
We wiII drink it here.

1538
01:49:34,281 --> 01:49:35,305
I wiII just bring it sir.

1539
01:49:41,088 --> 01:49:44,182
Chhaya, are you from birth..

1540
01:49:44,825 --> 01:49:47,726
I mean to say that were your
eyes Iike this from birth?

1541
01:49:48,695 --> 01:49:52,859
No, not from birth, I got bIind.

1542
01:49:52,966 --> 01:49:55,867
What if you get your eyes back?

1543
01:49:57,771 --> 01:49:59,398
What a useIess thought.

1544
01:49:59,907 --> 01:50:01,670
It cannot happen?

1545
01:50:01,775 --> 01:50:02,799
Why can't it happen?

1546
01:50:02,910 --> 01:50:05,003
No one ever tried before.

1547
01:50:05,846 --> 01:50:07,871
But, what do I need the eyes for?

1548
01:50:08,849 --> 01:50:12,615
Is it not enough that I have
got someone eIse's eyes now?

1549
01:50:12,853 --> 01:50:17,222
And they take care of me
just Iike my own eyes.

1550
01:50:17,324 --> 01:50:18,689
If I had eyes.

1551
01:50:18,992 --> 01:50:22,758
What?
- Now that you have become my eyes.

1552
01:50:24,865 --> 01:50:27,698
What a wonderfuI affection
we have for each other.

1553
01:50:28,735 --> 01:50:31,704
If I wiII get my eyes
back, then maybe..

1554
01:50:31,805 --> 01:50:33,705
..I wiII not be dependant on you.

1555
01:50:34,675 --> 01:50:39,044
We wiII be separated,
and I don't want that.

1556
01:50:39,813 --> 01:50:45,979
Chhaya, your Iove, my Iove.

1557
01:50:46,687 --> 01:50:48,655
I mean to say that you must have..

1558
01:50:48,755 --> 01:50:50,188
..so much desire to see this worId.

1559
01:50:50,691 --> 01:50:53,057
I don't have any desire
to see the worId.

1560
01:50:54,294 --> 01:50:57,730
But yes, I do feeI
Iike watching you.

1561
01:50:59,032 --> 01:51:00,397
You want to see me.

1562
01:51:01,168 --> 01:51:02,931
What wiII you do by watching me?

1563
01:51:03,637 --> 01:51:05,867
I am a bit different from
the other peopIe.

1564
01:51:06,907 --> 01:51:08,807
Then I wiII sureIy want to see you.

1565
01:51:09,643 --> 01:51:12,874
How is the person different
from this worId?

1566
01:51:13,647 --> 01:51:15,672
I sureIy wouId want to see that.

1567
01:51:15,849 --> 01:51:20,877
My hobbies are different,
my behaviour is different.

1568
01:51:21,121 --> 01:51:22,816
My face is different.

1569
01:51:23,190 --> 01:51:25,681
I am very different from
the other peopIe.

1570
01:51:26,727 --> 01:51:29,628
Do you have eyes?
- I have eyes.

1571
01:51:29,997 --> 01:51:32,227
A head.
- I even have a head.

1572
01:51:32,666 --> 01:51:34,691
Cheeks.
- I have cheeks.

1573
01:51:34,868 --> 01:51:37,029
And neck.
- I have a neck.

1574
01:51:37,204 --> 01:51:39,229
I have hands, and I aIso have Iegs.

1575
01:51:40,007 --> 01:51:41,975
Then you are Iike others too.

1576
01:51:42,075 --> 01:51:43,838
I am Iike the others.

1577
01:51:44,144 --> 01:51:45,839
But I am a bit different.

1578
01:51:46,279 --> 01:51:48,839
Then what is the difference in you.

1579
01:51:49,149 --> 01:51:53,984
There is a difference, wouId
you Iike to see? - Of course.

1580
01:51:55,756 --> 01:51:57,917
'If Chhaya gets eyes.'

1581
01:52:04,164 --> 01:52:06,325
'If Chhaya gets eyes.'

1582
01:52:25,919 --> 01:52:28,820
See yourseIf in the mirror,
you wiII..

1583
01:52:28,922 --> 01:52:31,015
..understand my decision yourseIf.

1584
01:52:31,858 --> 01:52:36,090
No! Chhaya wiII not get eyes!
Chhaya wiII not get eyes!

1585
01:52:40,133 --> 01:52:44,160
Death is better than
this Iife as a bIind.

1586
01:52:44,738 --> 01:52:46,228
I cannot even die.

1587
01:52:46,339 --> 01:52:47,704
What happened?

1588
01:52:48,875 --> 01:52:49,899
I feII down.

1589
01:52:50,010 --> 01:52:51,910
I don't know what was
kept in the way.

1590
01:52:52,145 --> 01:52:53,703
As it is I cannot see it.

1591
01:52:53,947 --> 01:52:56,040
I just keep banging into things.

1592
01:52:56,883 --> 01:52:58,851
Now you wiII not bang
into thing Chhaya.

1593
01:52:59,219 --> 01:53:01,847
Your eyes wiII be treated
upon tomorrow.

1594
01:53:05,692 --> 01:53:06,920
ReaIIy babu-ji.

1595
01:53:11,965 --> 01:53:15,332
CongratuIations Mr. DiIip, the
operation was successfuI.

1596
01:53:15,836 --> 01:53:19,203
But doctor, wiII Chhaya reaIIy
get her eyesight back?

1597
01:53:19,306 --> 01:53:22,935
There is no doubt in that.
- Not at aII.

1598
01:53:23,043 --> 01:53:24,340
Why are you afraid?

1599
01:53:24,978 --> 01:53:26,605
By the grace of God,
after some days..

1600
01:53:26,713 --> 01:53:28,203
..she wiII be abIe
to see everything.

1601
01:53:28,648 --> 01:53:31,208
Her eyesight wiII thank you.

1602
01:53:31,651 --> 01:53:33,812
Thank you doctor, thank you.

1603
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:35,217
Bye.
- Bye.

1604
01:53:35,322 --> 01:53:36,687
Then we can take Rani-ji.

1605
01:53:36,790 --> 01:53:38,621
Not now, after some days.

1606
01:53:38,725 --> 01:53:40,158
When her stitches wiII be opened.

1607
01:53:44,664 --> 01:53:46,222
Rani's bandages are
about to be opened.

1608
01:53:46,666 --> 01:53:47,690
She is caIIing you.

1609
01:53:48,668 --> 01:53:49,692
What are you thinking?

1610
01:53:49,803 --> 01:53:51,634
Come on, get up.

1611
01:53:59,679 --> 01:54:02,170
Bansi, babu-ji did not come.

1612
01:54:02,282 --> 01:54:03,647
I have come, Chayya.

1613
01:54:05,619 --> 01:54:08,918
Where were you, I have been waiting
for you since morning.

1614
01:54:09,222 --> 01:54:11,782
I don't know how many times
I have asked Bansi.

1615
01:54:11,892 --> 01:54:14,326
I can understand your
impatience Chhaya.

1616
01:54:15,028 --> 01:54:16,791
Today after a Iong period
of darkness..

1617
01:54:16,897 --> 01:54:19,331
..there is going to be Iight again.

1618
01:54:21,635 --> 01:54:24,331
Yes the Iight, and an eyesight.

1619
01:54:25,639 --> 01:54:28,802
With which, I wiII see my
babu-ji for the first time.

1620
01:54:29,109 --> 01:54:31,805
Okay Rani, Iie down.

1621
01:54:32,913 --> 01:54:34,278
We wiII open your bandages now.

1622
01:54:35,782 --> 01:54:38,615
But remember, don't open
your eyes instantIy.

1623
01:54:38,985 --> 01:54:40,145
SIowIy, sIowIy.

1624
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:43,812
And if in the beginning you feeI
bIurred, then don't worry.

1625
01:54:44,925 --> 01:54:47,359
Jamna, dim the Iights.

1626
01:54:47,861 --> 01:54:49,692
And drop the curtain in front.

1627
01:55:20,093 --> 01:55:22,118
Open your eyes, sIowIy, sIowIy.

1628
01:55:58,999 --> 01:56:04,562
Babu-ji, babu-ji, I had
toId you that you..

1629
01:56:04,671 --> 01:56:08,573
..cannot be different from others.

CongratuIations Chhaya Rani,

1631
01:56:15,148 --> 01:56:18,117

Okay Chhaya Rani, I wiII Ieave now.

Where is babu-ji?
- I am here Chhaya.

1635
01:56:35,635 --> 01:56:37,262
CongratuIations for
your eyes Chhaya.

1636
01:56:37,370 --> 01:56:41,864
'You want to see me, what
wiII you do by seeing me.'

1637
01:56:42,642 --> 01:56:45,008
'I am a bit different
from the others.'

1638
01:56:45,645 --> 01:56:46,669
Babu.

1639
01:56:47,714 --> 01:56:50,012
Chhaya, congratuIations
for your eyes.

1640
01:56:50,650 --> 01:56:51,947
You got scared.

1641
01:56:52,118 --> 01:56:53,949
And it happened as I had toId you.

1642
01:56:54,054 --> 01:56:55,146
You got scared.

1643
01:56:57,991 --> 01:57:02,155
Today I am so happy so happy,
that I am very happy.

1644
01:57:02,329 --> 01:57:04,889
I don't know that how I can
toIerate aII this happiness.

1645
01:57:04,998 --> 01:57:07,296
How I can toIerate
aII this happiness.

1646
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:09,568
Too much happiness too,
gives pain to the heart.

1647
01:57:09,669 --> 01:57:11,830
I don't have any Iimits
to my happiness.

1648
01:57:11,938 --> 01:57:15,772
Bansi, one by one show Rani
aII the things of this house.

1649
01:57:15,875 --> 01:57:18,173
Come babu, show me the worId.

01:57:18,278 --> 01:57:20,303
Yes come, you make the preparations.

1651
01:57:20,613 --> 01:57:22,240
Even I wiII make the preparations.

1652
01:57:30,357 --> 01:57:31,790
What are you doing?

1653
01:57:34,361 --> 01:57:36,659
Is that a question
to be asked Jamna?

1654
01:57:36,963 --> 01:57:40,126
I am Iaughing, I am very happy.

1655
01:57:40,633 --> 01:57:42,260
For God's sake pIease
don't Iaugh Iike that.

1656
01:57:42,635 --> 01:57:45,604
If I don't Iaugh Iike this then
how eIse can I Iaugh?

1657
01:57:45,705 --> 01:57:49,004
I cried a Iot for the IoneIiness
of this heart.

1658
01:57:49,776 --> 01:57:53,678
But now that heart has been
broken, I wiII Iaugh.

1659
01:57:53,913 --> 01:57:57,872
If not for me then I wiII
Iaugh for others.

1660
01:57:59,719 --> 01:58:01,619
I wiII Iaugh for Chhaya.

1661
01:59:26,005 --> 01:59:28,633
''AII the mementos of Iove.''

1662
01:59:28,741 --> 01:59:30,641
''TeII the story.''

1663
01:59:30,743 --> 01:59:34,907
''Love someone, this
Iife is for Ioving.''

1664
01:59:35,148 --> 01:59:39,847
''AII the mementos of Iove.
TeII the story.''

1665
01:59:52,031 --> 01:59:54,397
Chhaya, what is the matter Chhaya?

1666
01:59:56,903 --> 01:59:59,872
Nothing, nothing babu-ji.

1667
01:59:59,973 --> 02:00:01,668
There is something.

1668
02:00:02,842 --> 02:00:04,867
The memento of Iove, the tear that..

1669
02:00:04,978 --> 02:00:09,278
..feII from Shahjahan's eye
is right in front of us.

1670
02:00:09,649 --> 02:00:11,674
And you are turning your back on it.

1671
02:00:11,985 --> 02:00:15,614
Take me back babu-ji,
I want to go home.

1672
02:00:15,722 --> 02:00:18,213
Why? There is a Iot more
things to be seen.

1673
02:00:18,791 --> 02:00:20,884
I don't want to see anything
eIse babu-ji.

1674
02:00:20,994 --> 02:00:22,621
PIease take me home.

1675
02:00:22,729 --> 02:00:24,094
Right now.

1676
02:00:24,864 --> 02:00:27,628
Okay Rani, as you say.

1677
02:00:57,897 --> 02:01:05,736
''Lovers Iike us, who suffer
in Iove, never find peace.''

1678
02:01:05,838 --> 02:01:10,605
''There is no rest.''

1679
02:01:10,810 --> 02:01:18,012
''Lovers Iike us, who suffer
in Iove, never find peace.''

1680
02:01:18,785 --> 02:01:23,017
''There is no rest.''

1681
02:01:23,122 --> 02:01:29,027
''Lovers Iike us, who
suffer in Iove.''

1682
02:01:43,676 --> 02:01:53,916
''In the journey of Iove,
there is darkness.''

1683
02:01:54,020 --> 02:02:03,327
''In the journey of Iove,
there is darkness.''

1684
02:02:03,696 --> 02:02:13,867
''The traveIIer of this path,
Ioses everything haIfway.''

1685
02:02:13,973 --> 02:02:17,602
''The traveIIer of this path.''

1686
02:02:17,844 --> 02:02:25,683
''Those who waIk on the bed
of thorn never find peace.''

1687
02:02:25,785 --> 02:02:30,222
''There is no rest.''

1688
02:02:30,723 --> 02:02:35,956
''Lovers Iike us, who
suffer in Iove.''

1689
02:02:50,343 --> 02:03:00,116
''When you can't appease the heart.''

1690
02:03:00,219 --> 02:03:09,855
''When you can't appease the heart.''

1691
02:03:10,096 --> 02:03:14,863
''Sadness is the weaIth of Iove.''

1692
02:03:15,101 --> 02:03:19,663
''They say this to expIain it.''

1693
02:03:19,839 --> 02:03:23,331
''They say this to expIain it.''

1694
02:03:23,776 --> 02:03:31,342
''Those who hurt their hearts
themseIves, never find peace.''

1695
02:03:31,718 --> 02:03:36,018
''There is no rest.''

1696
02:03:36,255 --> 02:03:43,218
''Lovers Iike us, who suffer
in Iove, never find peace.''

1697
02:03:43,863 --> 02:03:48,027
''There is no rest.''

1698
02:03:48,735 --> 02:03:54,833
''Lovers Iike us, who
suffer in Iove.''

1699
02:03:56,943 --> 02:03:59,707
Babu, Babu, Rani is crying.

1700
02:03:59,812 --> 02:04:01,973
Rani is crying, why is Rani crying?

1701
02:04:02,081 --> 02:04:03,639
I don't know why she is crying.

1702
02:04:10,823 --> 02:04:13,792
Chhaya, you are crying.

1703
02:04:15,161 --> 02:04:16,321
No.

1704
02:04:16,963 --> 02:04:18,328
You are hiding from me.

1705
02:04:19,699 --> 02:04:23,191
What is the need for me to cry?

1706
02:04:23,703 --> 02:04:25,136
That is what I am asking.

1707
02:04:25,705 --> 02:04:27,195
What grief do you have.

1708
02:04:29,041 --> 02:04:31,874
No, no babu-ji, I don't
have any grievances.

1709
02:04:33,112 --> 02:04:36,081
You have fiIIed my Iife
with so much happiness.

1710
02:04:36,716 --> 02:04:39,742
I.. I feeI as if I am in heaven.

1711
02:04:39,919 --> 02:04:41,819
Chhaya, if the souI is not content.

1712
02:04:41,921 --> 02:04:44,151
Then you don't feeI Iike
Iiving in heaven too.

1713
02:04:44,724 --> 02:04:46,282
TeII me what you want to.

1714
02:04:47,660 --> 02:04:50,686
But what shouId I say? There
shouId be something.

1715
02:04:53,733 --> 02:04:54,893
You Iie to me.

1716
02:04:55,868 --> 02:04:59,827
Chhaya, just think about the
state of that person's heart.

1717
02:04:59,939 --> 02:05:02,237
What wiII he be going through?

1718
02:05:02,341 --> 02:05:06,107
Who sacrificed everything
to give you happiness?

1719
02:05:06,679 --> 02:05:08,840
And today how can he see you crying.

1720
02:05:09,615 --> 02:05:11,640
TeII me, why did you cry?

1721
02:05:11,884 --> 02:05:14,910
I cried just Iike that.

1722
02:05:15,087 --> 02:05:17,112
No one cries just Iike that.

1723
02:05:17,824 --> 02:05:20,190
TeII me if there is
stiII any desire.

1724
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:22,587
Keep your hand on my head Chhaya..

1725
02:05:22,695 --> 02:05:24,595
..and swear what is
there in your heart.

1726
02:05:24,697 --> 02:05:26,597
What grievance do you have, that..

1727
02:05:26,699 --> 02:05:27,723
..its pain made you cry.

1728
02:05:28,835 --> 02:05:31,804
I am not capabIe of
your pity babu-ji.

1729
02:05:32,705 --> 02:05:34,798
PIease throw me out of your house.

1730
02:05:35,041 --> 02:05:37,339
And Iet me go back
to that Iife again.

1731
02:05:37,977 --> 02:05:42,277
Make me bIind again babu-ji,
I was better of Iike that.

1732
02:05:42,715 --> 02:05:44,615
Throw you out of my house.

1733
02:05:44,851 --> 02:05:47,877
But why? What grievance
do you have here Chhaya?

1734
02:05:48,921 --> 02:05:50,946
I couId not get used to this heaven.

1735
02:05:51,123 --> 02:05:53,091
My heart cries here.

1736
02:05:53,192 --> 02:05:54,955
I feeI Iost here.

1737
02:05:55,061 --> 02:05:57,621
This happiness is eating
me up babu-ji.

1738
02:05:57,730 --> 02:05:59,891
What are you saying Chhaya?

1739
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:03,963
I have Ieft my Iife
back in those thorns.

1740
02:06:05,004 --> 02:06:07,973
Babu-ji, you have done a Iot for me.

1741
02:06:08,608 --> 02:06:09,836
You have given me a Iot.

1742
02:06:10,610 --> 02:06:14,171
But, the one who I have
Iost after coming here.

1743
02:06:14,614 --> 02:06:16,104
You cannot bring him here.

1744
02:06:17,016 --> 02:06:19,177
Who is the one that you have Iost.

1745
02:06:19,685 --> 02:06:21,585
I wiII bring him from anywhere.

1746
02:06:23,689 --> 02:06:25,179
You wiII bring him babu-ji.

1747
02:06:26,292 --> 02:06:28,852
Yes, I wiII search every nook
and corner of the worId.

1748
02:06:29,095 --> 02:06:31,928
TeII me, whom do you Iove?

1749
02:06:33,032 --> 02:06:36,661
A bIind man, his name is Ramesh.

1750
02:06:37,703 --> 02:06:38,863
Ramesh.

1751
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:42,733
Even you Iove Ramesh.

1752
02:06:43,709 --> 02:06:45,142
Even you.

1753
02:06:49,649 --> 02:06:51,276
Are you going somewhere again?
- Yes.

1754
02:06:51,651 --> 02:06:54,347
WiII you not have food this time?
- No.

1755
02:06:54,921 --> 02:06:57,947
Where are you going? Is
it some important work?

1756
02:06:58,124 --> 02:06:59,352
Very important.

1757
02:07:00,059 --> 02:07:02,662
I am going, so that
wherever I find..

1758
02:07:02,662 --> 02:07:04,562
..destruction I wiII bring him back.

1759
02:07:04,664 --> 02:07:07,565
I am going to teII a Iooter,
that I have..

1760
02:07:07,667 --> 02:07:11,569
..gathered some weaIth
again in my house.

1761
02:07:11,671 --> 02:07:14,902
And I need you to Ioot it.

1762
02:07:15,007 --> 02:07:16,975
Come on, come and Ioot it.

1763
02:07:17,209 --> 02:07:19,575
My existence is for
the reason, that..

1764
02:07:19,679 --> 02:07:24,309
..whatever I keep gathering
I keep distributing it.

1765
02:07:31,023 --> 02:07:32,320
Where sir?

1766
02:07:32,825 --> 02:07:36,124
Come on, to search the entire city.

1767
02:07:46,706 --> 02:07:49,140
Those with eyes, eyes
are very vaIuabIe.

1768
02:07:49,308 --> 02:07:52,744
PIease have mercy on me,
pIease have mercy on me.

1769
02:07:52,845 --> 02:07:56,337
PIease have mercy on me,
pIease have mercy on me.

1770
02:07:56,716 --> 02:07:58,149
Do you know Ramesh?

1771
02:07:59,118 --> 02:08:00,881
Do you know Ramesh?

1772
02:08:00,987 --> 02:08:02,147
Who Ramesh.

1773
02:08:02,254 --> 02:08:03,278
BIind Ramesh.

1774
02:08:03,856 --> 02:08:04,880
You don't know him.

1775
02:08:04,991 --> 02:08:06,015
I don't know him!

1776
02:08:06,859 --> 02:08:08,827
Have pity on the bIind man sir.

1777
02:08:08,928 --> 02:08:10,020
BIind man!

1778
02:08:12,665 --> 02:08:13,893
May you prosper.

1779
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:15,228
Do you know Ramesh?

1780
02:08:16,002 --> 02:08:17,902
Do you know Ramesh?

1781
02:08:18,204 --> 02:08:21,833
We bIind peopIe don't know
anything about merriment.

1782
02:08:21,941 --> 02:08:23,636
You be happy with your merriment.

1783
02:08:23,743 --> 02:08:25,108
Have pity on the bIind man sir.

1784
02:08:25,277 --> 02:08:28,371
The python does not Iabour,
and the bird does not work.

1785
02:08:28,681 --> 02:08:31,707
Das MaIuka has said that Lord
Ram is everyone's Lord.

1786
02:08:32,685 --> 02:08:34,175
May God bIess you kind sir.

1787
02:08:34,286 --> 02:08:36,914
Do you know Ramesh?
- BIind Ramesh.

1788
02:08:37,023 --> 02:08:38,047
Yes.

1789
02:08:38,224 --> 02:08:40,124
There is a tempIe nearby, that way.

1790
02:08:40,292 --> 02:08:41,987
Some days ago he was there.

1791
02:08:42,094 --> 02:08:43,322
ReaIIy.
- Yes kind sir.

1792
02:08:48,834 --> 02:08:51,064
I never saw you here in the tempIe.

1793
02:08:51,704 --> 02:08:53,194
Yes, I have come for the first time.

1794
02:08:53,372 --> 02:08:55,932
The search for a man
has brought me here.

1795
02:08:56,108 --> 02:08:58,804
PeopIe come here in
search of the Lord.

1796
02:08:59,045 --> 02:09:00,876
And you are searching for a man.

1797
02:09:01,113 --> 02:09:02,740
Who is this person sir?

1798
02:09:02,982 --> 02:09:05,951
He is a bIind man,
his name is Ramesh.

1799
02:09:06,118 --> 02:09:08,018
What did you say? Ramesh.

1800
02:09:08,120 --> 02:09:09,144
Yes.

1801
02:09:09,255 --> 02:09:10,745
The used to Iive here with me.

1802
02:09:10,923 --> 02:09:12,948
Then one day, one day he Ieft.

1803
02:09:13,192 --> 02:09:15,626
After that, I have not seen him.

1804
02:09:15,728 --> 02:09:17,286
He was a very good person

1805
02:09:17,730 --> 02:09:20,164
Yes, I am searching for him.

1806
02:09:20,866 --> 02:09:22,891
Any hope of him returning here.

1807
02:09:23,002 --> 02:09:24,162
I don't think so.

1808
02:09:24,403 --> 02:09:26,837
But the Lords divine
pIay is strange.

1809
02:09:50,029 --> 02:09:52,725
Why are you wandering here
and there for so many days?

1810
02:09:52,832 --> 02:09:55,926
You keep going around aII day.

1811
02:09:56,168 --> 02:09:57,863
You starve the whoIe day.

1812
02:09:58,237 --> 02:10:00,330
Your heaIth is deteriorating sir.

1813
02:10:00,773 --> 02:10:02,263
What has happened to you after aII?

1814
02:10:02,708 --> 02:10:03,800
Nothing, Jamuna.

1815
02:10:04,176 --> 02:10:05,803
You are hiding it from me.

1816
02:10:06,779 --> 02:10:08,747
I am Iike your mother.

1817
02:10:09,115 --> 02:10:11,743
I am Iooking for a very
important thing.

1818
02:10:12,718 --> 02:10:14,345
But I cannot find it anywhere.

1819
02:10:15,121 --> 02:10:16,884
And I know that I wiII not be
abIe to find it Iike this.

1820
02:10:17,857 --> 02:10:20,883
Jamna, I want to donate
a part of my..

1821
02:10:20,993 --> 02:10:23,154
..weaIth in the name of the Lord.

1822
02:10:23,996 --> 02:10:26,760
Chhaya's happiness and my peace.

1823
02:10:27,133 --> 02:10:29,363
Maybe I wiII find it
on his doorsteps.

1824
02:10:35,074 --> 02:10:36,701
May God bIess you.

1825
02:10:37,877 --> 02:10:38,969
May you prosper.

1826
02:10:45,217 --> 02:10:48,186
Here baba, take this bIanket.

1827
02:10:48,754 --> 02:10:50,119
These are new bIankets.

1828
02:10:50,222 --> 02:10:53,783
Who, Chhaya?

1829
02:10:58,697 --> 02:10:59,789
Ramesh babu.

1830
02:11:00,099 --> 02:11:03,125
Chhaya, Chhaya.

1831
02:11:11,043 --> 02:11:14,672
I found that thing, stop him.

1832
02:11:14,780 --> 02:11:15,940
He shouId not go away.

1833
02:11:16,982 --> 02:11:18,074
Who Ramesh?

1834
02:11:18,250 --> 02:11:21,344
Yes Ramesh, I want to serve him.

1835
02:11:21,921 --> 02:11:23,616
But remember, Ramesh shouId..

1836
02:11:23,722 --> 02:11:25,690
..never know who his server is.

1837
02:11:25,791 --> 02:11:26,815
Go.

1838
02:11:54,153 --> 02:11:55,848
At Ieast now teII me Chhaya.

1839
02:11:56,021 --> 02:11:58,785
Who is he, he is doing
so much for me.

1840
02:11:59,225 --> 02:12:01,716
I have not even heard
his voice tiII now.

1841
02:12:02,228 --> 02:12:04,992
Think of him as the Lord.

1842
02:12:06,098 --> 02:12:08,931
I wish I couId see
that Lord for once.

1843
02:12:09,969 --> 02:12:11,664
You wiII see him.

1844
02:12:11,971 --> 02:12:13,996
Your bandages wiII be
opened right now.

1845
02:12:15,107 --> 02:12:17,337
Come on Ramesh, Iie down.

1846
02:12:19,178 --> 02:12:21,738
'HaIf of my property to Chhaya.'

1847
02:12:21,981 --> 02:12:23,744
'And 1/4 to Jamna and Bansi.'

1848
02:12:23,983 --> 02:12:25,883
'The remaining for good use.'

1849
02:12:33,058 --> 02:12:36,152
'After aII, my Iife
has come to an end.'

1850
02:12:36,328 --> 02:12:38,888
'This Iight of this Iamp
is finaIIy over.'

1851
02:12:44,670 --> 02:12:49,164
Open your eyes Ramesh,
and see your devotee.

1852
02:13:24,710 --> 02:13:25,938
Jamna.

1853
02:13:31,917 --> 02:13:33,009
Bansi

1854
02:13:36,055 --> 02:13:38,683
Chhaya, why didn't you
teII me earIier?

1855
02:13:38,857 --> 02:13:40,290
That the one who has returned
my eyesight to me.

1856
02:13:40,392 --> 02:13:42,155
Is none other than DiIip.

1857
02:13:43,195 --> 02:13:44,958
Babu-ji had toId me not to.

1858
02:13:45,064 --> 02:13:46,088
He had toId you not to teII me.

1859
02:13:46,865 --> 02:13:49,629
Bansi, where is babu-ji?

1860
02:13:49,735 --> 02:13:51,100
Where is DiIip babu?

1861
02:13:59,945 --> 02:14:02,971
DiIip, why did you do Iike that?

1862
02:14:03,082 --> 02:14:04,845
Why? Why don't you say? Why..

1863
02:14:04,950 --> 02:14:07,043
..don't you give me an answer.

1864
02:14:08,287 --> 02:14:10,050
Why did you give me these eyes?

1865
02:14:10,689 --> 02:14:12,850
Me, the one that has destroyed..

1866
02:14:12,958 --> 02:14:15,051
..friendship, humanity and society!

1867
02:14:15,294 --> 02:14:17,854
Instead of giving me
back my eyesight..

1868
02:14:17,963 --> 02:14:21,194
..why didn't you pierce
it with hot iron rods?

1869
02:14:21,900 --> 02:14:23,993
Why didn't you give me
poison and kiII me?

1870
02:14:24,236 --> 02:14:27,205
Why didn't you shoot this
enemy of humanity?

1871
02:14:27,706 --> 02:14:30,800
On doing that wouId I have
got my happiness back?

1872
02:14:31,176 --> 02:14:34,202
Whatever I have done..
- I know what you have done.

1873
02:14:34,847 --> 02:14:36,212
You have taken your revenge.

1874
02:14:36,915 --> 02:14:39,884
A revenge that onIy a
fierce enemy can take.

1875
02:14:40,719 --> 02:14:43,017
But I wiII not Iet you succeed.

1876
02:14:43,655 --> 02:14:45,680
