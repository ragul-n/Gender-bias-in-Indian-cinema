00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:11,710
['Vancheesha Mangalam' by the great poet, 
Ulloor S Parameswara Iyer]

2
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,630
Namaste, Dhanu. 
- Hi.

3
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,100
How are you? 
- Welcome.

4
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,710
Welcome. 
- Hi.

5
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,150
Hi Steve.

6
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,160
Steve, this is what we 
call 'Athithi Devo Bhava'.

7
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,410
Dhanu, it's the passing out ceremony of 
the first batch of students here today.

8
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,180
The students are all in 
that excitement & energy.

9
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,300
Really?

10
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,920
Those are all classrooms. 
- Yeah?

11
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,960
The fact that students are not feeling 
suffocated in concrete buildings...

12
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,040
That itself, is such a relief.

13
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,060
True.

14
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,280
These 30 acres upon which the school 
stands now, belonged to Palayckal family.

15
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,170
Now, with the two farming villages nearby,

16
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,890
and the colony at that foothill,

17
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,020
all three sides are 
part of us now.

18
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,590
It's more appropriate to say 
that we're a part of them.

19
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,640
True.

20
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,750
Is it the prayer practice?

21
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,120
This is Fayiz Mohammed. 
Our own maestro.

22
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,160
The schools in old Travancore, used to 
start by singing 'Vancheesha Mangalam'.

23
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,490
Yes, it's a prayer from us to the past.

24
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,900
Well done!

25
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,870
This is oil paint, right?

26
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,380
Nice.

27
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,570
Do come. 
He's expecting you.

28
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,120
Achuetta, they are here. 
- Namaste.

29
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,420
We just saw the whole campus. 
It's beautiful.

30
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,190
Congratulations!

31
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,060
The functional model that the 
students of this school developed,

32
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,890
for the rebuilding of villages which 
were destroyed by the floods in Kerala,

33
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,350
has been officially selected 
by our State Government,

34
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,510
and made a part of the 
implementation policy.

35
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,530
It's for the first time in history,

36
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:25,420
that a school project is getting such a 
recognition from the State Government.

37
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,850
This project will receive funding 
through global partnership.

38
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,740
When the faces of thousands who thought 
that they had lost everything,

39
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,110
turn bright with happiness,

40
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,070
all credit goes to 'School of Joy'.

41
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,740
Malayali...

42
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,520
Malayali is awesome, right?

43
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,070
The state and people 
who abandoned monarchy,

44
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,290
and brought Communism to power through 
ballot, for the first time in the world.

45
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,260
They have always 
supported good causes.

46
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,920
Credit goes to them.

47
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,070
Christian and Steve have come as 
guests of the State Government.

48
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,130
They want to meet the smart 
boys and girls of this school.

49
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,220
But I came to meet the person hiding behind 
the wooden board that says 'School of Joy'.

50
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,270
One who's not easily accessible...

51
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,210
One who doesn't brag on social media...

52
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,300
An enigma.

53
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,650
Ashwin Vasudev.

54
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,720
What magic have you 
performed on these kids?

55
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,670
I'm so amazed.

56
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,300
Have you thought about the 
great wonder called 'Human'?

57
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,890
The one who created millions of Gods.

58
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,790
The one who created 18 Puranas, 
and two world wars.

59
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,640
He himself will rule the 
world as a Jinn or a Janab.

60
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,270
He will play the buffoon 
with a half-moustache.

61
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,040
He can create a new life in a glass tube, 
and create explosions from atoms.

62
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,080
He is the music, painting and dance 
which intoxicates the world.

63
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,770
The moon, Mars and the 
stars are within his palm.

64
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,140
Dynasties, palaces and statues built 
upon the blood of his brothers,

65
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,660
can be destroyed by him on the streets, 
by shedding the same blood.

66
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,380
For the fire of his faith, candles 
and empires would stand witness.

67
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,190
He is peace.

68
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,430
He is destruction as well.

69
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,190
Human.

70
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,350
In this world, a human is the 
greatest God, and Demon too.

71
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,110
Learning begins when we choose whom to be, 
among those two.

72
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,860
The kids here try to learn everything, 
and not just the good.

73
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,500
In fact, we shouldn't be 
teaching kids to write answers.

74
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,420
Instead, they should be 
taught to ask questions!

75
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,350
Don't ask me where I dug this out from.

76
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,250
Is the little rebel Ashwin Vasudev, 
present in this photo?

77
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,010
I'm not there in this picture.

78
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,260
Yet, I'm there.

79
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,330
I clicked this photograph.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,190
More than friends whom 
I considered my own,

81
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,790
this enemy who fought against 
me from the opposite side,

82
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,490
created this Ashwin 
whom you see today.

83
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,090
And thus,

84
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,470
my story...

85
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,870
... is theirs too.

86
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,540
'18th Step'

87
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,490
Back then, there were two 
kinds of schools in our city.

88
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,030
One.

89
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,540
Government Model School, where children 
of ordinary folk used to study.

90
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,900
Silence!

91
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,700
My dear Rao grandpa...

92
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,800
You started this ideal institution 
naming it 'Model School'.

93
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,180
Do you know what its 
current condition is?

94
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,440
Out of 300 days in the school calendar, 
around half would go by as protests,

95
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
and strikes!

96
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:33,500
Even if there's a small problem, they 
would turn this capital city upside down.

97
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,920
My blood pressure which was at 120, 
has now reached 240.

98
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,920
My heart may burst and 
I may die any moment.

99
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,200
One of God's messengers has landed 
here to save this school and me.

100
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:51,710
You should also pray that he 
stays here somehow, Grandpa!

101
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,220
The second one,

102
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,620
was our International School, where 
only rich children used to study.

103
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,130
Bless us with love and mercy. 
Amen.

104
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,940
It's the 25th day since the strike 
of the expelled teachers commenced.

105
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,200
We're not able to reach a 
compromise, despite several talks.

106
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,320
We'll recruit new faculty 
and run the school.

107
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,310
Both schools had their own 
gangs and underworlds.

108
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,410
What united those two schools that 
had no chances of coming together,

109
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,340
were Kowdiar bus stop and 
a double Decker bus.

110
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,280
Model School's gang leader was Ayyappan, 
who was much senior to us in age.

111
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,640
City Police Station Head Constable 
Vijayan Chettan's son.

112
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,850
Enough, Vijayan.

113
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,390
Ayyappan's right and 
left hands were,

114
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,690
Ambotty, son of Stanley Moore, 
who was the Godfather among mechanics,

115
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,360
and Suran, son of the owner of 
Attukal Theaters, Manakkad Pappan.

116
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,880
Even though they had 
their own bicycles,

117
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,600
they used to come all the 
way to the bus stop,

118
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,690
to see the bratty girls 
of Cotton Hill school.

119
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,800
Their red fort was the makeshift 
shop owned by Ambili Annan,

120
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,270
who used to get small scale 
hit-jobs done by children.

121
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,530
If you've come to study, 
you should study.

122
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,450
Or Ambili Annan will have to 
teach you certain things.

123
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,980
By playing arm wrestling, 
placing bets with union workers,

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,300
the ones who grew up as rogues, 
taking money for conducting strikes,

125
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,480
came to be known as the 
'Fellas of Model School'

126
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,110
In that world inhabited by Comrade 
Abhayan who was mad about politics,

127
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,070
and the little Mandrake 
called Paradeshi Patteri

128
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,230
who lost his way & reached 
Thambanoor bus stand,

129
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,530
there was only one thing 
that they didn't like.

130
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,920
Our school gang.

131
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,090
Two things that they didn't have, 
were lavish in our gang.

132
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,280
Money and good looking girls.

133
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,160
We're not afraid of rules!

134
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,660
Our furious fights used to 
happen in movie theatres

135
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,340
and at Poojappura ground, where 
we played Cycle Polo.

136
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,040
It would be right to say that the 
enmity of years between these schools,

137
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,670
were maintained by these gangs.

138
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,810
In Ayyappan's gang, 
apart from Suran and Ambotty,

139
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,020
there was Giri, who used to 
come from the railway colony,

140
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,940
the Karate twins Don and Duke,

141
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,540
Puthran, who was hot-headed, 
despite wearing the sacred thread,

142
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,310
Hari who had decided to 
dedicate his life for Mohanlal,

143
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,890
Ibru alias Kunjikka, 
who was the school romeo,

144
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,450
the studious Ajith Nair alias Aji, 
who was their collective brain,

145
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,350
break dancer Shogun,

146
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,730
Bakan, who got a TC from some school 
in Thrissur, for good conduct,

147
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,030
and Kombi, who never 
missed his aim.

148
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,690
And we were their enemies.

149
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,150
City Police Commissioner's 
son, Monty,

150
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,250
the NRI import, Sony,

151
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,010
seafood exporter Babychan's son Godfrey,

152
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,530
Khanna, the owner of a 
textile shop at Palayam,

153
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,860
Kiran alias Kiran D,

154
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,310
Arjunan,

155
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,520
George, who had an extra screw,

156
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,510
and the man of passion, Tittu.

157
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,470
And, the number one enemy 
of Ayyappan's gang,

158
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,950
Me.

159
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:04,330
In that ground, it never 
mattered who won the game.

160
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,530
What mattered was who would 
do a foul against whom!

161
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,590
To defeat everything,

162
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,450
that was the only way in 
front of both the teams.

163
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,330
After the exciting neck to neck grand 
finals, we have the champions.

164
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,320
And I request Dr. Hashir Abdul Gafoor 
to give away the trophy.

165
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,680
Sir, a few words.

166
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,130
Who wins on the ground 
is not important.

167
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,510
One should have a 
sportsman spirit in life.

168
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,950
All the best to both the teams.

169
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,680
Thank you, sir. 
Thank you.

170
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,500
We are the champions!

171
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,600
What are you doing? 
- What nonsense!

172
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,410
Dude, leave him.

173
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:58,970
Hey boys, no!

174
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,010
Move!

175
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,640
We'll sort you out later. 
- Leave me.

176
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,050
Ayyappa!

177
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,060
Oh shit! 
Devi, are you okay?

178
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,600
Dude, come. 
- Devi.

179
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,610
Are you okay? 
- Devi, are you okay?

180
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,910
Don't stay here. 
Let's go!

181
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,130
There's so much blood!

182
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,440
Come! Let's go! 
- Oh my God!

183
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,630
For Ayyappan, who instantaneously reacted, 
whenever he saw injustice,

184
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,880
time found a perfect 
role to play.

185
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,180
Today, he is a Major 
in the Indian Army.

186
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:38,900
The one who bravely leads a group who stops 
enemies from infiltrating our borders.

187
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,750
See! That's our target.

188
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,910
Before sunrise tomorrow,

189
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,870
our flag should fly there.

190
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,140
Since there was an avalanche 
in the eastern side,

191
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,190
there won't be any trouble 
from them tonight.

192
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,340
They would also be 
thinking the same.

193
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,190
That we won't trouble them.

194
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,570
Who's aware of all 
this, in our state?

195
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,510
That we're fighting in 
such conditions here....

196
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,240
When will all this end?

197
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,840
I don't know when it would end.

198
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,420
But...

199
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,380
the war against neighbours, 
started from school.

200
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,440
Friends from school.

201
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,000
They are still with me.

202
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,800
Can you find me in this?

203
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,070
This one?

204
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:12,730
This one.

205
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,500
Seriously?

206
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,900
Unimaginable!

207
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,500
We learned from those times,

208
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,750
when they couldn't predict 
what we would do,

209
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,040
and we couldn't predict how 
they would retaliate, right?

210
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,540
Captain, shall we start? 
- Yes, sir.

211
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Come on!

212
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,700
Captain, take cover.

213
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,610
Every war that happens 
in this world,

214
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,540
is either for land,

215
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,700
or for women. 
That's how the saying goes.

216
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,050
If the bullet I took on my chest today, 
was for our land,

217
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,800
back then, what shattered my heart,

218
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,890
was her look!

219
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,320
Ayyappan, 
say her name!

220
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,820
Ayyappan, 
say her name!

221
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,060
Say her name!

222
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,460
Ayyappan, 
say her name!

223
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,180
Lift him!

224
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,660
Say her name!

225
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,140
Put me back down.

226
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,640
Say her name!

227
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,990
Ayyappan, 
say her name!

228
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,600
Ayyappan, say her name! We won't 
leave you until you say it.

229
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,380
Say her name!

230
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,050
Oops!

231
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,110
Fellas!

232
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,370
Don't mess with Ayyappan!

233
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,140
Ayyappan's heart can't be 
shaken by some random girl!

234
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,580
Shall I go?

235
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,280
The one who captured your heart... 
Whoever that celestial beauty is,

236
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,560
we will find her, bro!

237
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,920
Brother, don't start the bus.

238
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,580
Paru... - Did you perform the 
drama at Pachalloor yesterday?

239
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,710
My aunt saw it.

240
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,450
Don't disgrace me.

241
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,700
She said it was really good. 
- It's not that.

242
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,470
Third seat from the front.

243
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,610
The fair girl, with a bruised forehead.

244
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,070
Need to know her name.

245
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,130
I can't go ask names 
of random girls.

246
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,150
Paru! 
It's not for me!

247
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,150
It's for Ayyappan.

248
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:56,970
Start the bus, brother!

249
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,560
Is it yours? 
- Yes.

250
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,380
Wow! What a nice watch!

251
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,420
Thank you.

252
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,160
What happened to your forehead?

253
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,320
I had a small accident.

254
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
What's your name?

255
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,440
Devi. 
- Oh! Devi.

256
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,750
Devi.

257
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,050
It's Devi.

258
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,630
Hey! It's Devi.

259
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,620
Devi.

260
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:40,010
'Sparkling a rainbow on a drop of blood, 
within the bat of an eyelid'

261
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:48,050
'Spreading a smile on the tip of a tear, 
you disappear, far away'

262
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,560
'As sharp as a piece of glass'

263
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,340
'The look that you give me'

264
00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:00,120
'Its piercing my heart, I am in pain. 
Who are you?'

265
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,970
'As the fights get furious, 
you walk around silently'

266
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:57,170
'I'm searching for a path to reach your shore, 
through many doors, in every corner'

267
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:04,890
'You are the origin of the beauty that has 
possessed my heart like an ocean of dreams'

268
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:13,040
'Dreaming that you would come before me, 
someday, sometime'

269
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:19,910
'I am roaming and wandering in search 
of you, where are you hiding?'

270
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,690
'As sharp as a piece of glass'

271
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,410
'The look that you give me'

272
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,910
You..!!

273
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,940
Catch him!

274
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,310
Ticket! Ticket! 
- Give the tickets back!

275
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,280
Stop! Stop!

276
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,300
What? 
Come on, look at our tickets!

277
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,080
Come on!

278
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,630
Come one by one!

279
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,910
When did you come? 
- Been some time.

280
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,630
Can't you chop off this hair & beard?

281
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,400
Come. 
- Come.

282
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,050
Okay. 
See you later.

283
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,180
Eat it. 
- I don't want it.

284
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,150
If you don't want, 
don't eat.

285
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,530
Since he filed his application 
following Vijayan's advice,

286
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,420
my sister's son got an admission 
in REC, in general quota.

287
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,690
Thanks a lot.

288
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,630
Children should listen to their elders.

289
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,050
Ask your mom to get back the mortgaged 
jewels, without delaying it further.

290
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,590
Does she still like Masala Dosa?

291
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,920
I mean, Devutty.

292
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,600
She's still studying well, right?

293
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,450
Leave him only after he eats. 
Okay, Ajith?

294
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,660
Mani, add it to my tab.

295
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,410
There's no Vada?

296
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,800
Vada has gone to Palani.

297
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,790
It's not hot either.

298
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,130
Shall I serve something hot?

299
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,820
Get lost!

300
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:27,660
That's what we haven't seen wherever 
we've gone as part of our study group.

301
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,840
Cheruthalam sir is the guide, right? 
- Yes.

302
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,140
He'll give you a chance to make 
the project very detailed.

303
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,330
Do one thing. 
Come home one day, Charu.

304
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,450
We're doing some activities there too. 
- Definitely.

305
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,660
This is my daughter Devaki. 
- Hi.

306
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,140
This is my elder one.

307
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,400
I know him.

308
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,250
I keep seeing Ayyappan, 
at the student centre.

309
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,310
Shall I leave then, Chechi? 
- See you.

310
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,330
What are you eating?

311
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,130
You always blame me for not eating.

312
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,760
Now you're scolding me 
even when I'm eating?

313
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,390
I've told you several times...

314
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,980
not to give her stuff, people 
buy from random hotels.

315
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,390
It's because you send me there 
to get this every month,

316
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,300
that I bring back what 
Dad gives me from there.

317
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,900
What did you think?

318
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,360
That I'm raising you both, 
because he's paying for it?

319
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,920
He's returning what he has borrowed 
from me at various instances.

320
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,530
And that's not his 
charity or anything!

321
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,140
Where are you going?

322
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,880
Raghuetta, this is a master plan we 
prepared for the functioning of our school.

323
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,950
If you present it in the 
upcoming committee,

324
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:30,360
it will be great for our unit's 
activities this year in our school.

325
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
That can wait.

326
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,160
That's not the biggest problem 
that your school is facing now.

327
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,960
It's him.

328
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,860
Sit.

329
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,990
Sit, dude.

330
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,510
Ayyappa, I'll tell you something.

331
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,080
You better stop your 
hastiness & anger.

332
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,900
If you interfere in unwanted 
matters & start fights,

333
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,470
don't expect me to intervene.

334
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,990
It's because they are always 
troubling us, Raghuetta.

335
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,790
Since we're ruling, people would 
consider this as our arrogance.

336
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,190
What a leader needs is 
tact and benevolence.

337
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,080
Show some maturity, man.

338
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,570
I know out of my own experience that it's 
difficult to control anger at your age.

339
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,690
Shall I tell you something 
that's not in the manifesto?

340
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,980
[Prayers to Lord Ayyappa of Sabarimala]

341
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,010

I saw here while standing at the bus stop. 
- Isn't this over yet?

345
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,620
So you can't eat fish 
or egg for 41 days now?

Not just that. He can't fight, 
he can't swear.

347
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,480
Ayyappan also needs 
some change, right?

348
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,720
What is this?

00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,740
That's good to know.

Niyaz, don't you want your bag?

356
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,550
I forgot it, bro. 
- Aji, come here.

357
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,170
What is it? 
- Have you gone to Sabarimala?

358
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,870
Buy something & eat for lunch.

359
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,760
I'll come only after taking 
mom to the general hospital.

360
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,850
See you.

361
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,860

- Get lost.

won't they suffocate & die?

The comrade has awakened. 
- Get lost, you rascal.

365
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
Anyway, I've to ride 
till here to drop Aji.

366
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,520
These kids stay near our house.

367
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,760
Otherwise, they would 
have to walk 4-5 kms.

368
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,410
While going back, I 
take them also along.

369

Well, you just want to laze 
around on that wall, or what?

370
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,760
Shouldn't we do whatever we can?

371
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,300
What are you good for?

372
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:38,500
This is why I keep saying that 
the school needs its own bus.

he'll talk to the minister.

- Ayyappa!

Teacher...

377
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:08,080
If I knew who hit me, 
I could have told you at least that.

378
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,190
But now, I can't say that too.

379
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:13,280
By the looks of it, it might be 
brothers of your girlfriends, Kunjikka.

380
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,310
Get lost, you brat!

381
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,210
I swear on God and this snack! 
None of my girlfriends have brothers.

382
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,470
I've chosen each of them so carefully.

383
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,010
What about me then?

384
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:25,330
Who's so brave to hit him on his 
head in front of our school?

385
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,930
They must have mistaken me.

386
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,840
I got beaten up instead of them!

387
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,580
Otherwise, why should 
anyone hit me, Teacher?

388
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,660
He's coming back 
home on time now.

389
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,480
He's eating on time as well.

If you're planning to take him 
away from here for this issue,

So he'll come back day after.

This much rice, 
and so many children.

449
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,750
Then how will the 
gruel be sufficient?

from what we get, right?

We came to talk 
about such an idea.

There's a bus that has been lying idle for 
the past 15 years, in our school godown.

467
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,290
If all of us repair it, it will be 
beneficial for students coming from far.

468
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,920

00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,150
The idea is good.

472
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,500
But it's not possible!

473
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,840

00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:59,220

won't there be some safety issues?

476
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,340
If they actively go forward, 
it will happen.

477
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,410
Our school can set a 
great example then.

478
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,000

479
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,580

480
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,100

'Exploring this way and that way, can you 
find a way to reach our destination?'

513
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,290
'What is this trouble?'

514
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:52,020
'A tiger is coming 
out of the jungle'

515
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,790
'What is this trouble?'

516
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,320
'A tiger is coming 
out of the jungle'

517
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,830
'Through many paths and by lanes, 
destiny will write a new story'

518
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,470
We have with us,

519
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,650
someone who is completely qualified to 
take up the leadership of our school,

520
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,040
respected Nandan Menon sir.

521
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:10,980
He has made many 
great achievements

522
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:14,840
by being part of Indian Space 
Programme since its inception.

523
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,390
He has taken up this 
responsibility selflessly,

524
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,060
without any monetary 
desires.

525
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,870
I welcome Mr. Nandan Menon.

526
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,680
My darlings!

527
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:42,970
I studied in an ordinary 
Government school.

528
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,640
I came from nothingness.

529
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,800
Something that many 
first world countries

530
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:52,230
that take pride in squandering and 
extravagance couldn't achieve,

531
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,720
was achieved by our country,

532
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,730
because people with great vision, 
inspired from their nothingness,

533
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,420
had born and died before 
us, in our country.

534
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:07,960
After all the achievements, the night 
I got a recognition from the country,

535
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,590
what came to my mind,

536
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,950
were not the the stars 
shining in the sky.

537
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,200
They were the stars 
born on this land!

538
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,500
Our children.

539
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,570
They constitute my dream now.

540
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:27,460
This bus which was rusting in a dark 
godown for more than 20 years...

541
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,030
These children have repaired it.

542
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,120
We're felicitating these children now.

543
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,460
Thank you, sir.

544
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,120
Did you have support from outside? 
- Yes.

545
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,620
Our teachers were all 
very co-operative!

546
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,460
Get lost!

547
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Hello!

548
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,660
Hello Father. 
- They didn't create any trouble, right?

549
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,380
No, no! No problem. 
- This is Aymanam Roy.

550
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,910
He's my cousin. 
- Hello Father.

551
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,230
When I heard that my 
sister was troubling

552
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,210
our relatives & cousins in Thiruvalla, 
Changanassery and Kottayam,

553
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,440
by visiting them often,

554
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,520
after completing her studies 
from Sophia College...

555
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,590
She has studied so much, right?

556
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,030
So I thought, let her teach now.

557
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:34,020
And she will be comfortable here.

558
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,230
What's your name, dear?

559
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,210
Annie.

560
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,450
Nice. 
- Father Philip.

561
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,190
What is it, Father? 
- Show her around the school.

562
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,360
Why not? - I'll see you in some time. 
- Take your time.

563
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,450
Thankachan...

564
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,210
This is peon Thankachan.

565
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,820
Hey Paru, pass.

566
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,290
Hi guys.

567
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,990
I am Annie.

568
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,240
Anna Jones.

569
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,450
I'm joining tomorrow.

570
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,460
So I'll be around for a while.

571
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:00,020
Woah! Too much politics, huh?

572
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,810
There's a history to it. 
I'll tell you later.

573
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,650
Wow, bro!

574
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,940
Beware of them. 
They are the villains here.

575
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,470
Interesting.

576
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,250
Good morning, Father. 
- Good morning.

577
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,250
Go to your class. 
Enough of your respect.

578
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:19,140
Good morning, Father.

579
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,360
What's your subject, Teacher?

580
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,550
Annie. 
- Huh?

581
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,070
I'm not a teacher yet.

582
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,230
I studied psychology.

583
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,870
I'm planning to teach English here.

584
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:27,930
That's good.

585
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:30,440
The one who teaches that subject 
here, is slightly mental.

586
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,320
He would need your 
psychology skills.

587
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,640
For whom? You? 
- Not for me.

588
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,230
Here he comes.

589
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,120
Good morning, Joy sir.

590
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,830
You don't deserve a good morning 
from me, Father Philip.

591
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,760
You left last night saying 
that you'll come for

592
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:02,560
the physical test of the 
cadets in the morning!

593
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:03,850
Where were you?

594
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,060
When I enquired at the kitchen, I was told 
that you went to the market for purchasing.

595
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:11,020
But Father Barsar told me that you 
sent Thankachan to the market,

596
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,720
and went to invite board members 
for the teachers' recruitment.

597
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,520
Christu Das said that you escaped 
from this Parish itself!

598
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:19,570
Why are you so complacent, 
Father Philip?

599
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:22,590
Shall I tell you the truth? 
I had a stomach upset this morning.

600
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,330
Coaxing Father Pattakalam & Father Job,

601
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:28,220
you pulled strings against the 
teachers protesting outside, right?

602
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:31,320
Can't you give them the compensation 
that they deserve, Father Philip?

603
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:32,870
Who is this?

604
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:34,770
Hi lady.

605
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,720
Me, myself Joy.

606
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,290
Joy Abraham Palayckal.

607
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,180
Annie. 
- Whose?

608
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,600
I mean... whose Annie?

609
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:45,790
Annie John? Annie Thomas? 
Annie Jacob?

610
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,900
Annie Masquerene? 
- Well, it's just Annie.

611
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,240
Plain and simple. 
Just like that.

612
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,770
Welcome to the circus, Annie.

613
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:55,530
See you.

614
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,640
Good morning, students.

615
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,230
Where there is a will, 
there is a way.

616
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:03,680
Great men walked on 
earth before us.

617
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:08,290
Today, our school is the 
best school in the state,

618
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:10,450
because of our commitment 
to excellence.

619
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:14,250
I now invite Father Pulicken, to 
address the gathering, please.

620
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,260
Dear students...

621
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,120
I should be talking in English.

622
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,480
But when my heart is full of joy,

623
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:24,520
I start speaking in Malayalam.

624
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,600
But if you talk in Malayalam, 
I'll demand a fine, by the way.

625
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,560
Two students...

626
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,190
Meenakshi Madhav, 
Ashwin V.

627
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:38,540
These very skilled students will 
be your headgirl and headboy.

628
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:42,760
Meenakshi's poems have been 
published by Oxford publications.

629
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,380
They are wonderful poems!

630
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:48,150
V Ashwin, who was granted 
NTSC scholarship last year..

631
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,900
I didn't notice him 
because of his studies...

632
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,170
He is a very good fighter.

633
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:58,760
By knocking out the star 
fighters of other schools,

634
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:01,380
he has brought a gold medal for us.

635
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:05,020
When the strike is intensifying outside, 
we are ready for anything.

636
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,260
If it's love, 
then it is love.

637
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:09,790
If it's a fight, 
then so be it.

638
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,880
Now I invite Meenakshi Madhav 
and Ashwin V to the dais.

639
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,830
Ashwin! Ashwin! Ashwin!

640
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:37,950
I now invite our school headboy, 
Mr. Ashwin V, to address this assembly,

641
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,860
and share with us, his emotions.

642
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:01,160
These are all his bloody tricks!

643
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,490
Monty, this is called jealousy! 
Okay?

644
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,620
He deserves that!

645
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,930
Ashwin! Ashwin! Ashwin!

646
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,770
All the girls are on his side now.

647
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:13,230
All the teachers are 
also in his pocket.

648
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,880
And now, he's the headboy too.

649
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,530
Now we'll have to bear 
with his attitude too!

650
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,560
Hey! The party is on me, guys!

651
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:23,930
Congratulations, bro! 
- Thanks, bro!

652
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:25,330
Let me guess!

653
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:27,290
Weren't you slandering 
about me now?

654
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,110
Monty, believe me.

655
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,770
I haven't played any games 
to become the headboy.

656
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:35,550
See, we can ruin this year 
by playing petty politics.

657
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,360
Or we can stand together strongly,

658
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,900
and make it the most 
memorable year in our lives.

659
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:41,490
I know...

660
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,830
There are many problems.

661
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,960
But trust me!

662
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,360
We'll give a reply that the local 
school would never forget, together.

663
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,500
Hands on that!

664
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,680
Yeah? 
- Yeah!

665
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,790
'Wind waves'

666
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:06,040
'And a sky full of stars'

667
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:16,490
'Wind waves are whispering 
untold stories to the rain'

668
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:24,500
'Whom are the stars winking at, 
while the world gradually goes to sleep?'

669
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:31,510
'Why is the morning dew drop 
dancing on the tip of a leaf?'

670
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:35,800
'While the sun goes down 
minding his own business'

671
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,590
'And the breeze 
is going wayward'

672
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:43,470
'Isn't everyone like us?'

673
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,670
'Aren't they all seeking ecstasy?'

674
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:51,850
'While the dreams keep shining the light'

675
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,430
'As the blue sky kisses our palms'

676
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:59,680
'A bird with blue feathers 
is flying up above'

677
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:04,010
'Down below, the earth 
is full of valleys'

678
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:08,320
'There are a lot more distances to cover'

679
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,540
'As the blue sky kisses our palms'

680
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:16,820
'A bird with blue feathers 
is flying up above'

681
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:21,160
'Down below, the earth is full of valleys'

682
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:25,410
'There are a lot more distances to cover'

683
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:46,810
'As dreams stretch out 
a thousand hands'

684
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:50,760
'The heart desires to 
reach out to them'

685
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:59,300
'I feel like humming the tunes of my heart, 
through my lips, without anyone listening'

686
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,420
'I feel like locking eyes with you'

687
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:07,840
'I feel like binding the sky 
and the earth together'

688
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:14,330
'As the world has blossomed for us'

689
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:16,820
'Isn't this magic?'

690
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,170
'As the blue sky kisses our palms'

691
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,460
'A bird with blue feathers 
is flying up above'

692
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:29,700
'Down below, the earth is full of valleys'

693
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,960
'There are a lot more distances to cover'

694
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:38,210
'As the blue sky kisses our palms'

695
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:42,550
'A bird with blue feathers 
is flying up above'

696
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,820
'Down below, the earth is full of valleys'

697
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:51,250
'There are a lot more distances to cover'

698
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,580
Hey! What happened 
to your thigh?

699
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,060
A rod pierced into it.

700
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:59,910
You should be careful 
with rods, man!

701
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:01,470
Don't laugh!

702
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,500
What is this?

703
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,320
This is the list of the 
people we owe money to.

704
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:07,390
Where? 
Let me see.

705
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,490
Who's going to pay 
all this and when?

706
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:11,710
Why are you talking 
like this, Abhayan?

707
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,420
You can't put a price for 
everything in the world, Abhayan.

708
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,440
Such virtue!

709
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,920
It's not that, Abhayan. 
- Then?

710
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:20,850
Did you see everyone's face here? 
- Yes.

711
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,810
Now look at my face. 
- Sheesh! Why?

712
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:24,940
Not for that.

713
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,540
Didn't you see the happiness on the faces 
of the children in the morning, Abhayan?

714
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:30,770
Shall I switch off the light? 
- No.

715
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:33,440
That guy from Thakarapparambu 
will thrash me like crazy!

716
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,130
Don't get me talking. 
- He'll come now. We owe him money.

717
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,500
Listen to me. 
We have other big brothers, right?

718
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:39,080
What they're saying is right!

719
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:40,950
We have other ways to 
collect money, right?

720
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:42,800
You don't have to be scared. 
- Come on, walk.

721
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:45,690
I don't think we'll be able 
to pay all that money back.

722
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,000
How can you say that? 
- What's that?

723
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,080
The bus is burning. 
- What's that?

724
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,980
Come!

725
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,260
Come fast!

726
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,840
Our bus!

727
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,680
Dude, it's burning!

728
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,370
What a night, guys! 
What a night!

729
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:05,520
We're burning their bus, 
having the best liquor of our lives.

730
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:07,540
Give them what they deserve, man!

731
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:09,700
Write their bloody names on the wall!

732
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:11,890
Hey! They're coming!

733
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:14,350
We've lost everything!

734
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:15,840
Run! Run! 
- Faster, guys!

735
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:17,350
Come on, run!

736
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:19,140
Ambotty... 
- Come on! Fast!

737
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,420
Fast, guys! Jump! Jump! 
- Catch them!

738
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:22,450
Don't let them go!

739
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,600
Ambotty, catch them! 
- Ayyappa!

740
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:26,830
Fast!

741
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:28,230
Guys, give me your hand!

742
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:29,750
Give me your hand! 
Fast! Fast!

743
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:32,330
Fast! 
- Catch them!

744
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:33,970
Catch them! 
- Jump!

745
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,030
Catch him, Ambotty!

746
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,480
Tear it.

747
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,600
Put the fire out. 
- Throw it.

748
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,430
Stop, you scoundrel.

749
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,060
Our bus is gone!

750
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,800
Someone, put out that fire!

751
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,160
Our bus is gone!

752
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,310
Our bus...

753
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:06,550
Look!

754
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:08,920
We don't need any 
more proof, right?

755
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:37,870
Hey!

756
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,020
No one should touch it.

757
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:47,400
It's the new name that they gave us, 
coming to our school's courtyard.

758
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,240
Look!

759
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:53,470
The love and affection of all 
our friends and brothers....

760
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:56,360
They burned it down, 
in a single night.

761
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:59,670
Whoever wrote this,

762
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,610
until he comes here and erases this,

763
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,080
it should remain here.

764
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:06,160
It should sting our eyes!

765
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:08,230
It should pierce our hearts!

766
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,150
If there's even one man 
who's loyal to his mother,

767
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:14,900
come along!

768
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,920
Let's go and question those cowards 
who swore at our fathers....

769
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:21,800
Come! 
- Come!

770
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:27,160
Long live the revolution!

771
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:30,650
The blood on the war field stands witness!

772
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:34,030
We will avenge this!

773
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:37,080
Long live the revolution!

774
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:40,330
When you wage a war against us,

775
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:43,350
let us remind you something!

776
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:46,580
You won't see your 
mother before you die.

777
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:53,500
We don't care a damn 
about the police!

778
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:57,540
Wherever you may go and hide,

779
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:00,890
Whichever darkness you 
may seek refuge in,

780
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:04,510
we will avenge this!

781
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:08,470
We will avenge this!

782
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:10,440
Dude, I was in the bathroom.

783
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:12,840
Then Kiran asked me to 
come to the chemistry lab.

784
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:14,820
When I came in here, 
both doors got locked.

785
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:16,660
Who... 
- Dude, Joy sir.

786
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:18,500
Sir, why are we here?

787
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,370
Sir, why have you 
locked us up here?

788
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:23,220
Did you hear the commotion 
happening outside?

789
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,450
For burning their bus,

790
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:28,040
they are furious enough to 
burn this whole school down.

791
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:29,910
Ashwin...

792
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:31,350
Sony... 
Monty...

793
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,090
George... 
Godfrey...

794
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:37,690
I don't know whether the priests here 
believe that you burned that bus or not.

795
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:39,970
But I know one thing.

796
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,050
It wasn't you guys who did it.

797
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:45,600
Something that you snorted in!

798
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:47,530
That's what made you do all this.

799
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:48,780
I know!

800
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,710
Sony... 
- Sir.

801
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:54,290
I've told you a hundred times not 
to supply this stuff to them.

802
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,070
Hey!

803
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:00,960
I won't surrender you guys to them, 
inside the school premises.

804
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:03,230
But for whatever you've done...

805
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,040
Face it!

806
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,560
Nothing.

807
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:13,790
Take it easy, man!

808
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:15,230
Bro, look!

809
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:23,190
See!

810
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,990
You know where I got 
this from, right?

811
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:28,570
You bloody... 
- Dude, hold on! Acid!

812
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,400
If we go out after throwing 
this on your faces,

813
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,830
we'd be cheating our brothers 
who have come with us.

814
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,550
Moreover, we'll have to meet 
those losers whom you'd hire,

815
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:39,810
to beat us up in the dark.

816
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:43,880
So let's fight it out 
in the open, properly!

817
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:45,070
What say?

818
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,880
If you're sure about 
who your fathers are,

819
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:50,260
bring along as many 
people as you can!

820
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,930
Me and my fellas will be 
at Poojappura ground.

821
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:56,630
We'll see!

822
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:27,070
Let's show them, boys!

823
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,100
Come on!

824
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:14,460
Ayyappa!

825
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:42,750
Yeah!

826
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:44,200
Beat them, boys!

827
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:27,370
Come! 
- Come!

828
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:42,640
Come on!

829
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:56,970
You...!!

830
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:31,110
What is it?

831
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:32,650
Achuetta...

832
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:34,830
Don't worry, Father.

833
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:35,870
I'll handle it.

834
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:39,720
I came in person, because this would affect 
the future of the students of both schools.

835
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,350
It's only because of that.

836
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:43,040
The legal hassles...

837
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:44,480
Francis will handle that.

838
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,520
I told you, right?

839
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:47,420
I'll handle it. 
You may go now.

840
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:48,910
Father, you can leave.

841
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:49,960
I'll bring them.

842
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:51,300
Their parents are here.

843
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:52,760
Send them home at the earliest.

844
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:55,210
Go and talk.

845
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:57,080
Where is Ashwin? 
- Sir.

846
00:59:58,450 --> 00:59:59,450
By the way,

847
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,700
Father has compromised the case.

848
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:03,190
There's nothing to worry.

849
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:05,930
What can we do about this?

850
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:10,950
Another public nuisance shouldn't 
happen in the name of that burnt bus.

851
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:13,250
We will investigate and 
find out what happened.

852
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:14,600
But that will take time.

853
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:20,620
Father left after discussing a compromise 
plan that will be beneficial for you.

854
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:25,530
They will give you an amount 
as a compensation.

855
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,270
You can buy not just one, 
but two buses with that.

856
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:33,150
Now you shouldn't fight each other for 
that on the road for that, hereafter.

857
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,760
Around 12 boys are in the 
hospital with broken bones.

858
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:37,190
Well, sir...

859
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:39,580
We don't need a single 
penny from them!

860
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:41,610
If we accept the money from them,

861
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:43,550
that's not called 'compensation'!

862
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,920
Vijayanna... 
- Sir...

863
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:48,480
Open your mouth only when I ask you to! 
You heard me?

864
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:49,620
Vijayanna... 
- Sir...

865
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:53,820
Can you touch even the shadow 
of at least one of those boys?

866
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:55,120
No, right?

867
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:57,580
I'm saying this for your information...

868
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,310
Each of these boys were born 
to fathers and mothers.

869
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:05,730
Don't show the arrogance of your uniform, 
on our children's cheeks.

870
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:07,450
Let the investigation 
take its course.

871
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:10,250
Note down all their names & 
addresses and let them go.

872
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:13,150
But sir...

873
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:16,160
Yes! We did it!

874
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:17,450
Yeah!

875
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:19,190
Come on, Monty!

876
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:23,070
Monty, I was worried 
whether your Papa,

877
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:26,210
the Commissioner would ruin it, 
by showing off, cinema style!

878
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:28,340
This is only because we could use 
Commissioner sir's influence...

879
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:30,540
Or else, we'd be standing like this in our 
underwear, at the police station now.

880
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,220
And not because Father 
Pulicken spoke to them!

881
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,960
Guys, listen!

882
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:38,210
Titumon wants to say something!

883
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:44,580
This calls for some celebration!

884
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:51,120
Where is it? 
- Come! Come on!

885
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,140
Take it, fast.

886
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:55,850
Take it, fast. 
- Slowly! Don't be so greedy!

887
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,360
Where is it? 
Did you get it?

888
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:00,780
Must be a success party, huh?

889
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,280
Joy sir!

890
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:07,190
Shame on you guys!

891
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,280
I haven't come to advice you.

892
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:11,570
I came to give you this.

893
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:13,680
It's a suspension letter.

894
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,820
Now you needn't go to the 
school for some days.

895
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:18,930
Happy, right?

896
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,700
Sir, how many times has he hurt 
our boys at public places?

897
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:24,470
So how else can we give an answer to him? 
- Exactly!

898
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:28,620
You should have asked this question 
before doing this atrocity.

899
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:33,710
It's not by destroying the excellence they 
achieved with so much effort,

900
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:35,280
that you should become excellent.

901
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:38,520
You should have shown them something 
more brilliant than that.

902
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,530
Finally, you wrote whatever you guys are, 
on their wall!

903
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,570
Bastards!

904
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:49,070
F***.... 
- F U all boys!

905
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:58,120
I've also gone on a shortcut drive 
to find happiness through a needle.

906
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:00,440
My life got messed up, totally!

907
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:04,810
For 4-5 years, a chemical factory's 
siren rang through this brain!

908
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:06,840
I started it as a 
style statement!

909
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:08,540
And what happened?

910
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:11,380
In this same dormitory, 
under this same roof...

911
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:12,660
You know what happened?

912
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:16,460
Depression, hysteria, 
and then suicidal attempts too.

913
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:20,720
Since I had my elder brother 
in my father's position,

914
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:22,910
I got a return ticket back to life.

915
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:24,680
Listen.

916
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:28,350
I had to fall at the management's feet, to 
turn this borderline dismissal of yours

917
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,260
into a suspension.

918
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:31,750
Trust me, guys.

919
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,640
You will have to quit this habit.

920
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:35,900
Ashwin, aren't you a boxer?

921
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:40,030
A fighter needs the perseverance 
to hold on until the last round!

922
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:41,670
We will fight this out!

923
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:45,240
We can win this game together, guys!

924
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,600
Now there's no point in staying here.

925
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:50,580
Pack your bags. 
Let's go.

926
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:52,140
Where to, sir?

927
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:57,120
I've told your guardians that 
this is a special study tour.

928
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:59,460
Study tour? 
- But the place we're going to....

929
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:01,970
That's a surprise.

930
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:05,810
Susan Aunty, look! 
Look!

931
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:08,930
Solomon, was this the surprise you 
were talking about? - Of course!

932
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:09,950
Joy!!

933
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:13,490
Chachan!

934
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:18,440
Solomon Chachan and Susan aunty!

935
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:20,020
We belong to them 
for one week now!

936
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:22,260
Welcome to Palayckal house.

937
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:24,950
This bachelor said a big lie & 
imported aunty from America.

938
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:27,110
There he goes! 
- Hey Champ!

939
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,430
How was your journey? 
- Great.

940
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:30,900
Hi. 
- Hi.

941
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,940
This is the house where 
I was born & grew up!

942
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:35,570
And the reason I shifted the 
annual day rehearsal here...

943
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:37,870
Open stage, free food...

944
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,730
free accommodation...

945
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:45,090
Free accommodation?

946
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:47,430
By the time you freshen up, 
breakfast will be ready.

947
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,110
Drama and music are all fine!

948
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:52,150
But me and big boss will have our eyes 
on everyone! - There he goes again.

949
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:54,920
Boys should stay in that 
out-house over there.

950
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,170
Girls should stay here. 
Okay?

951
01:04:58,190 --> 01:05:00,700
Once dinner is done, I'll 
let the dog loose. Mind it!

952
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,160
I'm here, right Chachan?

953
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,650
I meant you mainly! 
- He's jealous! - Of course.

954
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:06,590
By the way, 
Susan aunty is a great cook.

955
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,710
She's known for her cook books. 
Right?

956
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:10,950
So many of us are here, right? 
We'll also join.

957
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,950
She's really fast.

958
01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:16,260
What speed, man! I've cooked 
for so many people, right?

959
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Come.

960
01:05:19,370 --> 01:05:20,370
Well, well!

961
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:23,180
Didn't you serve lunch 
for big boss yet?

962
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,320
He won't let anyone sleep tonight.

963
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,520
Listen, kids...

964
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:28,910
He is the creator of this house!

965
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:31,170
He is still very much live.

966
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,120
Look carefully!

967
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:36,130
He can see everything!

968
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:07,410
'O beauty, spreading your feathers 
all over this snow filled path'

969
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:10,070
I'm out of practice.

970
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:12,300
Love failure?

971
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:13,650
No!

972
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:26,090
'O beauty, spreading your feathers 
all over this snow filled path'

973
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:28,310
Aby...

974
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:31,490
I'm not at all ready for this.

975
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,670
Annie, I'm an investment 
banker in London.

976
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:37,610
I have some fixed deposits that 
I earned with my own efforts,

977
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:40,580
and my ILR status would be 
ready by the coming Christmas.

978
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:44,250
Moreover, I'm a Christian guy with 
great pedigree, from Mullassery House.

979
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,560
What among these are you 
not ready for, Annie?

980
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:47,650
Exactly.

981
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:49,650
Aby Mullassery is perfect.

982
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,010
I...

983
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:53,340
I have nothing to do, 
coming into Aby's life.

984
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:54,710
Leave that.

985
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:55,730
Who's the guy?

986
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,140
I won't come, Chachan.

987
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:59,060
Will you come here or 
should I come there?

988
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:02,430
Thank you.

989
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:04,980
Check if the salt & 
pepper are enough!

990
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:06,280
The smell of pepper!

991
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:08,900
Hey!

992
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:11,760
Why don't you get dressed? 
- Some for me!

993
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:18,480
What is it? 
- Hey! Where are you going?

994
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:20,930
I'm going to the market, 
to buy some beef.

995
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:23,240
See you!

996
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:28,180
'A star anyone would bow down to'

997
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:34,870
'On the path where angels descend'

998
01:07:36,930 --> 01:07:38,320
The star's position would be here.

999
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:39,860
Make the angels stand under that.

1000
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:42,650
It's not liquor. 
It's just black tea.

1001
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:46,890
Tea! Tea!

1002
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,250
So cute, right?

1003
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:56,170
'O beauty, spreading your 
feathers all over this snow filled path'

1004
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:58,740
Hey come, Angel. 
It's okay.

1005
01:07:58,810 --> 01:08:00,080
Nothing wrong.

1006
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:01,170
Here. Have a drag.

1007
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:05,770
Hey! Angel!

1008
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:07,650
Ashwin, leave her.

1009
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:09,840
Monty, don't do this again.

1010
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:11,730
Come, I say!

1011
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:15,990
It happened to her 
again yesterday.

1012
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:18,030
Slight withdrawal symptoms.

1013
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:20,190
I spoke about it to everyone.

1014
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:23,120
Everyone promised that 
they won't do it again.

1015
01:08:26,190 --> 01:08:27,640
I trust your words.

1016
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:29,940
But Ashwin, one thing.

1017
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:31,260
For you....

1018
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:33,660
Please don't break my trust.

1019
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:36,190
Come!

1020
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:41,290
[Indistinct instructions]

1021
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:47,920
[instructions continue]

1022
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:51,800
Angel, are you okay?

1023
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:53,740
I'm perfectly fine.

1024
01:08:53,770 --> 01:09:02,420
'O beauty, spreading your 
feathers all over this snow filled path'

1025
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:13,720
So here we get into the magical world of 
Sir William Shakespeare's 'The Tempest'.

1026
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:34,680
Go slow! Go slow!

1027
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:35,710
Up.

1028
01:09:35,730 --> 01:09:36,920
Slowly! Slowly!

1029
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:37,940
Enough.

1030
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,630
Devi, did you see Ashwin? 
- No. I didn't see him.

1031
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:51,740
Where are you going?

1032
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:54,350
The play is about to start. Come fast. 
- Just five minutes.

1033
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:55,790
Keep quiet, Mathukkutty sir.

1034
01:09:58,590 --> 01:09:59,590
Ashwin!

1035
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:01,510
I've been looking 
everywhere for you.

1036
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,370
Angel, what are you doing here?

1037
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:05,740
Aren't you supposed 
to be on the play?

1038
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:07,200
It's all messed up, man!

1039
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:08,810
I'm really nervous and...

1040
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:11,930
I think I'm going to ruin this play.

1041
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:12,950
You will be fine.

1042
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:15,700
Be calm. Go with the flow. 
- No, Ashwin.

1043
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:17,830
Can you do me a favour?

1044
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,640
Please.

1045
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:28,330
I badly need that magic pill, Ashwin. 
- No.

1046
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,220
I can't help you out.

1047
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:33,120
Didn't we give our words to Joy 
sir that we won't use it again?

1048
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:34,150
No, Ashwin.

1049
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:36,100
Please! 
Please!

1050
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:38,220
Okay.

1051
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,740
Okay? 
- Yeah.

1052
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:40,940
I have something better.

1053
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:42,050
Okay.

1054
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:43,140
Close your eyes.

1055
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:48,500
Breathe.

1056
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:00,550
Oh my God!

1057
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,980
Bro.... 
- Is this your practice?

1058
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:07,540
It's not like what you think...

1059
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,830
She wanted that thing, man! 
- And did you give it?

1060
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:11,050
Forget it.

1061
01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:12,350
Monty, go.

1062
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:13,910
Bro, don't make this worse.

1063
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,500
Monty, no!

1064
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:17,350
Wait, man. 
- Don't let spoil her life, man.

1065
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:18,910
- She can't handle that thing.

1066
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:20,180
Come on, Angel.

1067
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,710
Ashwin is feeling sad.

1068
01:11:22,030 --> 01:11:23,030
And...

1069
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:25,040
He asked me to give you this.

1070
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,060
Ashwin asked you 
to give me this?

1071
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:28,930
He's already high.

1072
01:11:29,290 --> 01:11:30,590
Let's have a good time.

1073
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:31,620
No!

1074
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:32,640
This is mine.

1075
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:33,840
Monty! It's dangerous.

1076
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:35,200
Let's go to the corner.

1077
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:36,230
Sony...

1078
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:38,600
Give me the stuff.

1079
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:39,850
Hey babe.

1080
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,120
Take it.

1081
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:58,430
No, Ashwin!

1082
01:11:58,530 --> 01:12:00,340
Stay away from me!

1083
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:07,270
It's Miranda's entry. 
Where is Angel?

1084
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:11,740
Jo, she's here, but 
she's very nervous.

1085
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,610
I sense something 
really strange.

1086
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:15,330
It's just a tension that 
any actor might have

1087
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:17,200
before the first bell of the play. 
- This is not that.

1088
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:20,160
Angel, dear... 
Get up!

1089
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,710
Stay away from me.

1090
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:25,550
One tight slap! Are you sleepy or what? 
- Get up!

1091
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:26,710
Come! Come! 
- Come on, angel.

1092
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:27,740
Come.

1093
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:29,820
Thankachan...

1094
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:31,700
Send the kids to the stage, fast.

1095
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,890
Ferdinand, get ready. 
Mini Teacher?

1096
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:35,510
Hey! Hey! Angel! 
What happened?

1097
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:37,390
What happened? 
- Christu Das!

1098
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:38,890
Arjunan, the play should happen.

1099
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:40,470
Let Ann go, instead of Angel.

1100
01:12:40,510 --> 01:12:41,510
Move. 
Everyone move.

1101
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,600
Move!

1102
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:45,140
Stay away from me. 
- Move, man!

1103
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:47,480
Move! Make way!

1104
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:49,520
All of you move. 
Just make some way.

1105
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,230
Mini Teacher, move all that stuff.

1106
01:12:55,230 --> 01:12:56,910
Is she having fits, sir?

1107
01:12:58,070 --> 01:13:00,590
No, Ashwin! 
Stay away from me.

1108
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:02,690
Teacher, pump her stomach. 
- Okay.

1109
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:06,460
Christu Das, ask Father 
Philip to arrange a vehicle.

1110
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,780
I'll inform the hospital. 
You handle the situation here.

1111
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,700
Teacher, can you make some ORS? 
She's dehydrating.

1112
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:12,730
I'll bring it.

1113
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:14,010
Devi, please take care.

1114
01:13:14,030 --> 01:13:15,030
What's this, Jo?

1115
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:16,590
It's a bloody drug overdose. 
- What?

1116
01:13:16,610 --> 01:13:18,580
Ashwin, I hate you.

1117
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:21,660
By the looks of it, 
seems like it's 'that'.

1118
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,350
What? 
- Pregnancy.

1119
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:25,920
Sir, please.

1120
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,010
Father Pulicken is here.

1121
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,880
She has fainted after 
some hanky panky.

1122
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:38,050
You're also responsible for spoiling 
that Ashwin and his friends.

1123
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,350
If incidents like these happen,

1124
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:44,240
us teachers shouldn't close 
our eyes to them, Joy.

1125
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:48,560
Anyway, you all will bring a 
great name to this school!

1126
01:13:53,170 --> 01:13:54,510
Ashwin! 
- Joy sir.

1127
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:58,430
No, sir. No! 
Don't do anything.

1128
01:13:59,590 --> 01:14:01,310
Sir, no.

1129
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,380
Don't do anything, sir.

1130
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,250
You guys will never learn!

1131
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:06,790
I told you so many times!

1132
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,480
Didn't you give me your word?

1133
01:14:08,690 --> 01:14:09,690
You broke that too!

1134
01:14:09,730 --> 01:14:10,930
Now go to hell!

1135
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:13,410
But...

1136
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,900
you spoiled that innocent girl!

1137
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:17,310
Sir, we didn't do anything.

1138
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:18,680
I was only trying to stop her.

1139
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:20,290
Please believe me, sir. 
- Now, wait.

1140
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:22,710
Trust me, sir.

1141
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,230
If something happens to that child,

1142
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:27,700
I won't spare any one of you!

1143
01:14:27,890 --> 01:14:30,230
I'll make sure that you are 
called to the management.

1144
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,550
No, sir.

1145
01:14:32,570 --> 01:14:33,690
Sir, no!

1146
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:37,360
Move!

1147
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:39,860
God!

1148
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:44,260
Ashwin...

1149
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:45,960
Look.

1150
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:50,050
What happened? 
Did Joy sir come and show off?

1151
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,960
Didn't I fall at your 
feet and tell you?

1152
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,780
That she cannot handle it?

1153
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:57,140
Joy sir....

1154
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:59,340
We'll handle him.

1155
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:05,660
Now all my charms are overthrown.

1156
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:09,230
The only power I have,

1157
01:15:10,330 --> 01:15:11,800
is my own.

1158
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:20,610
The gentle wind you blow 
with your applause,

1159
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,820
may fill my ship's sail.

1160
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:25,310
Without applause,

1161
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:29,310
my plan to please you has failed.

1162
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,120
Abhay, you were here? 
- Kiran D?

1163
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:42,140
Come. 
We have to tell you something.

1164
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:43,730
Come! Come!

1165
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:44,750
Leave me, man.

1166
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:47,810
Unless I'm relieved by prayer...

1167
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,430
which wins over the God himself,

1168
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:54,110
Nobody's watching.

1169
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:55,160
Annie Teacher!

1170
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:57,780
No. She won't see us.

1171
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:00,390
This is between us.

1172
01:16:00,650 --> 01:16:01,820
Indulge me!

1173
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:05,190
Forgive me!

1174
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:07,920
And set me...

1175
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:09,260
free!

1176
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:11,550
Hey!

1177
01:16:13,730 --> 01:16:16,220
No!

1178
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:54,570
We're not talking to you now as 
Ashwin's guardian or sister, Gauri.

1179
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:58,250
You are a committed writer 
and media-person, right?

1180
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:01,610
This problem came to our notice,

1181
01:18:01,690 --> 01:18:03,950
while this institution 
was getting liberated

1182
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:05,980
from the shock of 
a grave tragedy,

1183
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,490
The drug called Methamphetamine

1184
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:09,840
found in the blood sample of 
the girl who was the victim...

1185
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:11,970
She won't get it without 
an external help.

1186
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:14,520
When we asked her who 
provided this to her,

1187
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:17,140
her silence ended with one name.

1188
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:19,680
Ashwin.

1189
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:23,730
In this situation, we cannot go 
forward without making corrections.

1190
01:18:23,910 --> 01:18:24,910
Sorry to say...

1191
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:29,200
This council has decided that Ashwin cannot 
continue his studies in this school.

1192
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:32,530
Let me say this with all due respect 
to honourable academic council,

1193
01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:33,590
Not as anyone's sister.

1194
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:37,960
But this dismissal was the most simple 
punishment that you could give Ashwin.

1195
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:42,360
If he has done it, it should be taken 
up by a proper police investigation.

1196
01:18:43,330 --> 01:18:45,640
So if more people are involved in this,

1197
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,370
we would be able to find 
that network and eliminate it.

1198
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,790
But if you do that, many more 
people would come to know.

1199
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:52,000
Media will write about it.

1200
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:53,610
That will affect the 
goodwill of the institution.

1201
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:56,170
One student's dismissal is better 
than that any day, right?

1202
01:18:56,790 --> 01:18:57,790
Nice.

1203
01:19:00,690 --> 01:19:04,050
My responsibility as a 
guardian begins here.

1204
01:19:05,730 --> 01:19:08,760
Ashwin & I faced our childhood 
without parents.

1205
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:10,640
Growing up is not easy.

1206
01:19:12,530 --> 01:19:16,480
The responsibility of correcting any child, 
begins at home.

1207
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:21,140
There will be a day, when he would 
stand before you as a good citizen.

1208
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:23,760
That's my duty, as a sister.

1209
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:42,630
Your real journey begins when you 
think that everything has ended.

1210
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:44,340
Come.

1211
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,670
Let him stay here and 
complete this year.

1212
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,680
When you are here, I didn't look for 
any other place for Ashwin to stay.

1213
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:55,790
What are friends for!

1214
01:19:56,060 --> 01:20:00,460
He was expecting that you would take 
him along, when you go back to Bombay.

1215
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:03,750
Now I'll have an assistant to 
help me in teaching Maths.

1216
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,900
I took such a decision about him, 
after a lot of thinking.

1217
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:08,820
Joseph sir,

1218
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:11,220
hereafter, you would be his local guardian.

1219
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:15,210
This account belongs 
to both of us.

1220
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:16,940
Ashwin...

1221
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:20,950
You will start a new chapter of your 
life tomorrow, from this same city.

1222
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:27,750
This is a new beginning.

1223
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:29,280
All the best.

1224
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:30,530
Okay sir.

1225
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:47,880
Ayyappa, look who's standing in 
front of our school gate.

1226
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:43,260
Close the gate!

1227
01:22:33,230 --> 01:22:35,690
The wound is full of 
sand and glass pieces.

1228
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:39,220
Whatever accident you 
may claim it to be,

1229
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:41,560
just be thankful that 
the Lord saved you.

1230
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:44,400
Did you buy the medicine 
for the injection?

1231
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,500
Here you go, Mummy.

1232
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:47,720
Allen, shall I give you an injection? 
- Yeah!

1233
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:49,660
I'll give the injection for you!

1234
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:01,320
Erase it!

1235
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:04,010
Time and history stand witness!

1236
01:23:04,030 --> 01:23:05,780
Go and wipe it off!

1237
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,410
Go like this!

1238
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,190
The blood on the war field stands witness!

1239
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:12,840
This earth and the sky stand witness!

1240
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:13,950
Wipe it off!

1241
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:17,830
We will have our revenge!

1242
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:21,560
We will have our revenge!

1243
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:23,950
Time and history stand witness!

1244
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,240
Joseph sir...

1245
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:27,930
I'm not going back to 
that school again.

1246
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:30,550
If I go there,

1247
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:32,870
they will kill me.

1248
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,630
I'll talk to the headmaster.

1249
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:42,520
You won't have to face 
another violence from there.

1250
01:23:43,230 --> 01:23:45,300
Why are you experimenting 
with me, sir?

1251
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:48,570
Of all the places,

1252
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:49,820
why this school?

1253
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:51,830
Ashwin...

1254
01:23:52,050 --> 01:23:53,390
If you survive here,

1255
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:55,720
you can survive 
anywhere in the world.

1256
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,160
If you run away from here,

1257
01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:01,710
you will always be running 
away from your problems.

1258
01:24:18,090 --> 01:24:20,000
Hey! Ashwin is here. 
Monty...

1259
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:21,970
What are you doing here?

1260
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,470
I'm leaving this town forever.

1261
01:24:24,620 --> 01:24:25,780
But before I leave,

1262
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,310
I need to know something.

1263
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:30,150
For everything that happened 
to Angel that night...

1264
01:24:30,270 --> 01:24:31,550
Was it her who said my name?

1265
01:24:32,050 --> 01:24:34,620
Or did you guys make 
her say my name?

1266
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:36,670
Tell me, you rascal.

1267
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:37,780
Where is she?

1268
01:24:37,890 --> 01:24:38,890
I want to meet her now.

1269
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:41,170
Bro, that's never going to happen.

1270
01:24:41,870 --> 01:24:43,950
All the problems ended that night.

1271
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:46,580
If you meet her, that would 
lead to a new issue.

1272
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:48,770
So it's better for our future....

1273
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,000
that you don't meet her now.

1274
01:24:51,610 --> 01:24:53,490
Wasn't it you who gave 
it to her that night?

1275
01:24:54,290 --> 01:24:55,990
Who gave it to her first?

1276
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:57,050
Try to remember!

1277
01:24:57,170 --> 01:24:58,170
Wasn't it you?

1278
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:01,940
Who made her life dependent on it? 
You.

1279
01:25:02,010 --> 01:25:04,510
And now you're acting like a Saint? 
Get lost, Ashwin!

1280
01:25:04,550 --> 01:25:05,550
You..!!

1281
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:07,980
Hey! Leave him, man!

1282
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:11,370
Teacher! 
Teacher!

1283
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:12,990
Monty!

1284
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:21,260
We lost Joy that night...

1285
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:25,620
... because of me.

1286
01:25:37,410 --> 01:25:38,460
Leave it.

1287
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,530
It's all right. 
- I lost my temper.

1288
01:25:41,230 --> 01:25:43,110
I myself don't know 
what all I told him.

1289
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:45,840
We'll sort all that out tomorrow.

1290
01:25:45,990 --> 01:25:48,670
But now, this evening... 
this stage...

1291
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:50,450
Only that should be 
on your mind now.

1292
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:52,460
I don't want to do this play.

1293
01:25:53,150 --> 01:25:55,090
Joy, what all are you saying?

1294
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:57,270
After practicing for 
all these days,

1295
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:58,990
and those kids who are 
all dressed up...

1296
01:25:59,150 --> 01:26:00,940
None of them know all this.

1297
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:03,220
Isn't this a problem 
that has a solution?

1298
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:06,230
Cancelling this maiden 
production because of that?

1299
01:26:06,490 --> 01:26:07,630
Now, that's cruel.

1300
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:10,540
He was really honest when 
he told that to me, Annie.

1301
01:26:11,490 --> 01:26:14,210
You feel so because of your 
blind affection towards him.

1302
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:16,110
That boy has done this before,

1303
01:26:16,190 --> 01:26:18,130
and he hasn't quit that habit.

1304
01:26:18,330 --> 01:26:19,810
Isn't that the truth? 
- Annie...

1305
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:22,380
You don't know him.

1306
01:26:22,990 --> 01:26:24,170
I know him really well.

1307
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,880
Even if the entire world 
doesn't believe him,

1308
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,900
I will stand with him.

1309
01:26:33,820 --> 01:26:34,820
Because I know,

1310
01:26:35,330 --> 01:26:37,240
the feeling of being 
broken inside.

1311
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:40,510
Anyway,

1312
01:26:40,650 --> 01:26:41,880
let the play happen.

1313
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:55,550
If Jo had returned from 
the stage that night,

1314
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,930
the management wouldn't have 
made a wrong decision about you.

1315
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:03,580
Angel confessed everything to me.

1316
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,080
But...

1317
01:27:05,230 --> 01:27:06,230
no one,

1318
01:27:06,690 --> 01:27:09,440
no one gave her a choice 
to say the truth.

1319
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:14,370
Shall I leave, Miss?

1320
01:27:16,590 --> 01:27:17,590
Ashwin...

1321
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:19,560
What happened that day...

1322
01:27:20,370 --> 01:27:24,100
I'm trying to make myself believe 
that it was an accident.

1323
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:29,990
Even though both of us 
know that it wasn't one.

1324
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:38,610
Whatever Jo left behind, is in this.

1325
01:27:39,310 --> 01:27:40,310
Words...

1326
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:41,380
Drawings...

1327
01:27:41,530 --> 01:27:42,530
Music...

1328
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:43,620
Everything.

1329
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:47,890
You were a huge 
part of his dream.

1330
01:27:49,610 --> 01:27:51,780
If you are able to realize that some day,

1331
01:27:52,610 --> 01:27:53,780
to this world,

1332
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:55,490
to our midst,

1333
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:58,550
Joy sir might just come back.

1334
01:27:58,570 --> 01:28:03,250
'I stood in the rain'

1335
01:28:04,630 --> 01:28:12,940
'Your voice still rings in my mind'

1336
01:28:13,670 --> 01:28:25,310
'The soft touch and memories of the rain 
that falls into the river in my eyes'

1337
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:29,890
'I stood in the rain'

1338
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:31,860
Thank you Christu Das sir.

1339
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:35,520
It was Joy sir who suggested your 
name & convinced the priests about you.

1340
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:37,050
You should be thanking 
him for that.

1341
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:25,490
'The changing seasons gave dark colours 
to the words in the sky and disappeared'

1342
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:37,550
'The changing seasons gave dark colours 
to the words in the sky and disappeared'

1343
01:29:37,570 --> 01:29:48,950
'Someone drew a line across my heart, 
with indelible ink'

1344
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:51,940
'I stood in the rain'

1345
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,890
'I stood in the rain'

1346
01:29:55,290 --> 01:30:00,740
'I stood in the rain'

1347
01:30:01,450 --> 01:30:10,170
'Your voice still rings in my mind'

1348
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:14,790
'The soft touch and memories of the rain 
that falls into the river in my eyes'

1349
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,510
200 acres of land 
beyond this gate.

1350
01:30:16,670 --> 01:30:17,770
My brother gave it to me.

1351
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:19,520
He is in Stanford. 
He's a professor.

1352
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:21,020
I'll tell you about 
him gradually.

1353
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:27,320
'I stood in the rain'

1354
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:49,390
Oh!

1355
01:30:49,470 --> 01:30:50,470
You?

1356
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:52,540
That's why the dogs were 
all barking so loudly!

1357
01:30:52,590 --> 01:30:53,950
I had made a call to this house.

1358
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:55,140
No one picked up.

1359
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:57,230
Who's going to call us now?

1360
01:30:57,810 --> 01:30:58,810
Chopped it off!

1361
01:30:58,910 --> 01:30:59,910
The bloody phone-line.

1362
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:02,940
Come. We're in a family meeting 
at the northern courtyard.

1363
01:31:03,070 --> 01:31:04,070
Keep the bag there.

1364
01:31:04,130 --> 01:31:05,250
They will guard it.

1365
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:15,820
Do you know who this is?

1366
01:31:21,470 --> 01:31:23,100
Between intelligence and madness,

1367
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:25,360
God drew a line.

1368
01:31:26,150 --> 01:31:27,280
That is this incarnation!

1369
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:28,840
John.

1370
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:33,430
John Abraham Palayckal.

1371
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:38,980
Come!

1372
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:48,490
St. Thomas came on 
one such night.

1373
01:31:48,860 --> 01:31:51,670
Back then, this place was the 
house of Kolangara Pottis.

1374
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:59,110
The Namboothiri ancestor of 
all my great grandfathers.

1375
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:06,810
It was while he was relaxing by 
chewing betel leaves after dinner,

1376
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:08,550
that he heard a 'Hi' in Hebrew.

1377
01:32:10,070 --> 01:32:12,090
The Namboothiri replied in Sanskrit.

1378
01:32:13,190 --> 01:32:19,240
He understood that Thomas hadn't 
come there asking for food.

1379
01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:22,630
Back then, this Northern courtyard...

1380
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:25,710
was the biggest 
library of this town.

1381
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:26,740
Library!

1382
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:29,270
They spoke for one whole night.

1383
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:32,490
He learned about the story 
of Jesus who was crucified.

1384
01:32:33,290 --> 01:32:35,720
At dawn break,

1385
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:37,350
Thomas left.

1386
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:44,300
But whatever he said, 
never left Namboothiri's mind.

1387
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:49,940
Don't you know what he did after 
deciding to become a Christian, uncle?

1388
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:55,580
He burned all the manuscripts in the 
library, at this same courtyard.

1389
01:32:56,030 --> 01:32:57,870
For the dead to leave our minds,

1390
01:32:58,310 --> 01:33:00,480
everything that reminds us 
about them should be burned.

1391
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:02,130
See!

1392
01:33:03,930 --> 01:33:04,930
Like this.

1393
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Let us...

1394
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:16,400
do this to our Joy also,

1395
01:33:18,910 --> 01:33:19,910
and liberate him!

1396
01:33:24,370 --> 01:33:25,640
He is Joy's student.

1397
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:26,720
Ashwin.

1398
01:33:26,770 --> 01:33:27,770
He has come here earlier.

1399
01:34:16,650 --> 01:34:18,380
For this moment to arise.

1400
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:22,680
'Blackbird singing in the dead of night'

1401
01:34:23,670 --> 01:34:24,970
Year 1968.

1402
01:34:25,630 --> 01:34:26,630
Beatles.

1403
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:28,320
It was Joy's favourite song.

1404
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:30,920
John Lennon...

1405
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:32,250
and McCartney.

1406
01:34:33,550 --> 01:34:34,940
They wrote this for him.

1407
01:34:37,790 --> 01:34:41,440
Have you ever thought what good are 
flowers & candles, for the dead?

1408
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:44,640
They don't need all this now.

1409
01:34:44,870 --> 01:34:46,510
These are to remind us always...

1410
01:34:46,950 --> 01:34:50,160
that there are colours and lights 
remaining in our lives, even now.

1411
01:34:51,630 --> 01:34:53,020
The promise I made to Joy sir...

1412
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:57,210
I wasn't able to correct them.

1413
01:34:57,830 --> 01:34:59,500
All the corrections begin...

1414
01:34:59,730 --> 01:35:00,960
Hey! Look at me.

1415
01:35:02,250 --> 01:35:03,250
... from within oneself.

1416
01:35:04,290 --> 01:35:05,960
Joy got a second chance...

1417
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:07,930
to reclaim the life he had lost.

1418
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:11,430
But before he could do that, 
he had to go back.

1419
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:16,030
Now, life has offered 
you a second chance.

1420
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:18,150
I'm not going back there.

1421
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,600
Don't be adamant that the 
entire world should love you.

1422
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:26,440
We should learn our 
biggest lesson from ants.

1423
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,270
Be it any rain or storm, 
they always stand together holding hands.

1424
01:35:32,170 --> 01:35:35,060
For that, the technique that 
they adapt, is very simple.

1425
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:38,320
He will be there with the 
one right next to him.

1426
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:40,930
Without leaving his hand, 
holding his head close.

1427
01:35:43,060 --> 01:35:44,060
You...

1428
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:46,640
You should convince one person 
who's right next to you.

1429
01:35:47,170 --> 01:35:49,960
Once you convince him that 
you will be with him for anything,

1430
01:35:50,310 --> 01:35:52,130
a new world would 
open up around you!

1431
01:35:56,390 --> 01:35:58,390
It was your hand that Joy 
sought and held on to.

1432
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:01,310
Where his hand disappeared,

1433
01:36:02,370 --> 01:36:03,520
this hand would be there.

1434
01:36:05,290 --> 01:36:06,290
Go back!

1435
01:36:06,870 --> 01:36:08,190
And stay strong!

1436
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:20,480
Mummy!

1437
01:36:57,150 --> 01:36:58,150
Ashwin...

1438
01:36:58,510 --> 01:36:59,900
You are that dream!

1439
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,340
The greatest gift that 
can be given to Joy...

1440
01:37:03,940 --> 01:37:05,100
will be your success.

1441
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:18,180
Aren't you going to class today? 
- Let's bunk today.

1442
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:19,200
Then so be it.

1443
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:21,160
Look! 
He has come again!

1444
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:25,310
What is he doing here?

1445
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Stop there!

1446
01:37:29,350 --> 01:37:30,350
Catch him!

1447
01:37:34,710 --> 01:37:35,710
Catch him!

1448
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:38,140
Stop!

1449
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:43,060
Stop!

1450
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
You scoundrel!

1451
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:33,660
Kneel down over there!

1452
01:38:36,810 --> 01:38:38,080
Why are you here?

1453
01:38:38,110 --> 01:38:39,230
That period is over, right?

1454
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:40,530
Can't you go back to class?

1455
01:38:40,550 --> 01:38:41,770
Didn't you recognize him, sir?

1456
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:42,980
Or can't you see properly?

1457
01:38:43,390 --> 01:38:45,400
He's not eligible 
to enter our school!

1458
01:38:45,430 --> 01:38:47,050
Are you going to 
send him to the class?

1459
01:38:47,090 --> 01:38:48,250
Potti sir is not like that.

1460
01:38:48,650 --> 01:38:49,970
If you do something like that,

1461
01:38:50,010 --> 01:38:52,440
then who will teach us 
instead of Potti sir?

1462
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:54,660
Fate!

1463
01:38:54,830 --> 01:38:56,430
You can enter the class, right?

1464
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:12,630
You will be blessed, darling!

1465
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:24,610
Hey! 
- He's our punching bag, right?

1466
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:26,880
Didn't he have enough already? 
- He wants to be beaten up again.

1467
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:31,750
What can we do if some people 
aren't fed up of getting thrashed?

1468
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:36,570
Dude, Vikraman! 
- Oh no!

1469
01:39:38,270 --> 01:39:43,650
The same condensed silence I experienced, 
before being assaulted in the lock-up.

1470
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:44,950
Stand up!

1471
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:46,660
Sit down!

1472
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:48,020
Stand up!

1473
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:50,350
Sit down!

1474
01:39:51,220 --> 01:39:52,220
Very good!

1475
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:57,300
What?

1476
01:39:57,320 --> 01:39:59,130
Don't trouble that new 
admission boy anymore.

1477
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:00,640
You already gave him enough, right?

1478
01:40:00,850 --> 01:40:04,430
When I enquired, I found out that his sister 
is a senior party worker in the north.

1479
01:40:05,210 --> 01:40:07,210
Don't make me answerable for it.

1480
01:40:07,670 --> 01:40:08,670
Let him join you.

1481
01:40:28,290 --> 01:40:30,660
Convince a person who's right next to you.

1482
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:34,050
Once you convince him that 
you will be with him for anything,

1483
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,250
a new world would 
open up around you.

1484
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:43,260
Stretch your hand. 
- Don't hit me, sir.

1485
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:45,710
You won't do your home work?

1486
01:40:45,730 --> 01:40:47,620
Hit me over here. 
- What?

1487
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:49,380
Where's your home work? 
- Forgot to bring it.

1488
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:50,410
Why can't you obey me?

1489
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:52,320
Peeing in the class?

1490
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:53,360
Where is your homework?

1491
01:40:53,810 --> 01:40:55,560
You've done it, right? 
Then why are you stretching your hand?

1492
01:40:57,030 --> 01:40:58,030
Why?

1493
01:40:59,050 --> 01:41:00,470
This is not mine, sir. 
- Then?

1494
01:41:00,490 --> 01:41:02,130
I haven't done it. 
- Then who did it?

1495
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:05,680
Look at you, Mr. Clean!

1496
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,520
You're going down in studies!

1497
01:41:07,870 --> 01:41:09,110
This is not enough for you!

1498
01:41:09,250 --> 01:41:10,250
Who's left?

1499
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:11,570
Who's left to show 
me the home work?

1500
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,190
Who? 
Show me.

1501
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:14,820
What's this?

1502
01:41:14,850 --> 01:41:16,250
Home work. 
- This is all wrong.

1503
01:41:16,530 --> 01:41:17,760
My sister wrote it for me.

1504
01:41:26,220 --> 01:41:27,400
Elson, go carefully.

1505
01:41:35,430 --> 01:41:36,840
What do you want?

1506
01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:38,140
One chance.

1507
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:41,740
One chance to correct the mistake I made. 
Just once.

1508
01:41:42,050 --> 01:41:45,430
Aji, however much you beat me up for 
what I did to you guys and the school,

1509
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:46,710
it won't pain me.

1510
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:49,790
But the condemning stares 
from every student here....

1511
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:51,240
I want to change that.

1512
01:41:52,290 --> 01:41:54,790
I can do that only 
if you stand by me.

1513
01:41:55,330 --> 01:41:56,330
Please.

1514
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:58,030
You should understand me, Aji.

1515
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:00,900
Nothing will happen here, 
with my decision alone.

1516
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:04,890
The only one who can make a 
decision about you, is Ayyappan.

1517
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:10,750
Only one person in this world has the 
courage to go and say this to him.

1518
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:18,590
'On this moonlit night, 
at the shore of Karamana river'

1519
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:22,870
'I am waiting for my 
lover to embrace me'

1520
01:42:22,890 --> 01:42:26,740
'On this moonlit night, 
at the shore of Karamana river'

1521
01:42:30,580 --> 01:42:34,830
'My eyes are coy and full of love'

1522
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:38,800
'And I keep twisting and turning on 
the white sheets of my bed'

1523
01:42:38,810 --> 01:42:43,030
'You are confused and 
I am full of desire'

1524
01:42:46,820 --> 01:42:50,630
'You are confused and I am full of desire'

1525
01:42:50,650 --> 01:42:54,810
'My lover comes to me, 
caressing and embracing me'

1526
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:58,430
'At this moment'

1527
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:02,600
'On this moonlit night, 
at the shore of Karamana river'

1528
01:43:02,630 --> 01:43:06,670
'I am waiting for my 
lover to embrace me'

1529
01:43:06,690 --> 01:43:10,760
'On this moonlit night, 
at the shore of Karamana river'

1530
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:17,160
Suran...

1531
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:18,300
You're sitting here?

1532
01:43:18,430 --> 01:43:19,740
The next scene is 
about to start.

1533
01:43:19,770 --> 01:43:20,770
Come there, okay?

1534
01:43:20,850 --> 01:43:22,280
Get the money from 
the committee!

1535
01:43:22,610 --> 01:43:24,400
Then Suran will reach right on time. 
- Okay.

1536
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:25,920
How many times did I tell you...

1537
01:43:26,210 --> 01:43:28,340
... not to come to me, to 
speak for guys like him?

1538
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:30,310
If Ayyappan knows this, 
he'll beat you black & blue!

1539
01:43:30,330 --> 01:43:31,580
Suran! 
- Yes.

1540
01:43:31,610 --> 01:43:32,670
We are leaving.

1541
01:43:33,050 --> 01:43:34,180
Before the climax?

1542
01:43:34,310 --> 01:43:35,460
What is this, Paru? 
- We have to go.

1543
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:37,110
The guys sitting 
behind us are creepy.

1544
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:40,540
She gave a tight slap 
to one of those guys.

1545
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:42,030
So it wasn't the balloon bursting?

1546
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,990
They are the Thoppil brothers. 
- Athira...

1547
01:43:44,430 --> 01:43:46,120
Prabha... 
Can you just keep quiet?

1548
01:43:46,150 --> 01:43:47,250
Don't add fuel to the fire.

1549
01:43:47,420 --> 01:43:49,270
Can you please drop us 
till that road, bro?

1550
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:57,630
We might get an auto rickshaw 
from the junction. - I doubt it.

1551
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:02,260
Coming. 
- Thank you, bro.

1552
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:05,480
Are you getting a smell now? 
- Yes.

1553
01:44:05,510 --> 01:44:06,910
That's the snake's gush.

1554
01:44:06,930 --> 01:44:09,050
Oh no! Snake? 
Don't scare us, bro.

1555
01:44:09,100 --> 01:44:10,790
It comes out in the night 
searching for its mate.

1556
01:44:10,820 --> 01:44:11,820
Oh no!

1557
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:13,310
Who's that? 
Paru, stand closer.

1558
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:14,550
I think its those guys.

1559
01:44:14,850 --> 01:44:15,850
Who is it?

1560
01:44:16,270 --> 01:44:17,580
Do something, bro.

1561
01:44:22,940 --> 01:44:23,940
Who is it?

1562
01:44:23,970 --> 01:44:25,890
Didn't I tell you that 
we'll sit there itself?

1563
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:28,700
What do we do now? 
- Who is it?

1564
01:44:28,710 --> 01:44:30,050
They are walking towards us.

1565
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:31,890
Dude...

1566
01:44:32,010 --> 01:44:33,080
Was he a guy?

1567
01:44:33,270 --> 01:44:34,270
I doubt it.

1568
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:35,300
Lift his skirt.

1569
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:36,460
Paru, come here.

1570
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:38,930
Check, dude.

1571
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,100
Don't do anything.

1572
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:44,070
Leave me. 
- Leave them.

1573
01:45:01,110 --> 01:45:03,050
Run! Run!

1574
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:04,100
Run!

1575
01:45:13,470 --> 01:45:17,140
If they had done something nasty 
to my girl in front of my eyes,

1576
01:45:17,370 --> 01:45:19,160
would there be any point 
in me staying alive?

1577
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:22,500
Aji...

1578
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:29,970
If you guys had left 
when I shouted at you,

1579
01:45:31,510 --> 01:45:33,310
Paru and Vidya wouldn't 
have reached home.

1580
01:45:35,890 --> 01:45:37,030
What do I even....

1581
01:45:39,210 --> 01:45:40,210
Tell me.

1582
01:45:40,550 --> 01:45:41,550
What should Suran do?

1583
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:47,130
Giri, did you see who that is?

1584
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:49,270
Hey! Did you start service here?

1585
01:45:49,390 --> 01:45:50,770
Whom did you ask? 
- Giri, please.

1586
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:52,240
Aji, move. 
- Kunjikka, please.

1587
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:53,660
Come here. 
Who told you to?

1588
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:55,300
Hey Giri! Leave your hand. 
I told him.

1589
01:45:57,010 --> 01:45:58,570
Bro, he got hold of you?

1590
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,290
Shall I do something? 
I'll click a photo & leave him now.

1591
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:04,700
Hey Giri! 
Go!

1592
01:46:05,570 --> 01:46:09,070
What, Suran? Did he promise to buy sip-ups 
from the bakery for you in the evening?

1593
01:46:09,330 --> 01:46:10,330
Come.

1594
01:46:11,230 --> 01:46:14,310
You'll make me play a Telugu movie in 
a Malayalam movie theatre, is it?

1595
01:46:17,660 --> 01:46:19,190
Giri... 
- Aji, take him away.

1596
01:46:19,230 --> 01:46:20,860
What are you doing? 
- Leave me.

1597
01:46:21,010 --> 01:46:22,010
Suran, no!

1598
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:24,330
Come on!

1599
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:38,540
You go to the class!

1600
01:46:39,950 --> 01:46:40,950
Come. Let's go.

1601
01:46:42,160 --> 01:46:43,320
Suran, enough!

1602
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:45,800
If you raise your 
hand at anyone again,

1603
01:46:45,820 --> 01:46:48,030
Suran will chop off that hand!

1604
01:46:48,050 --> 01:46:49,050
Move!

1605
01:46:50,060 --> 01:46:51,240
Bro, did something happen to you? 
- Leave me.

1606
01:46:53,300 --> 01:46:54,490
Your shirt is soiled.

1607
01:46:54,570 --> 01:46:56,650
What is this? 
- What's the matter?

1608
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:57,680
What's it between you guys?

1609
01:46:57,700 --> 01:46:58,730
He is crazy.

1610
01:47:06,630 --> 01:47:09,050
Bro, even the balance rod is damaged. 
- Did you check?

1611
01:47:09,290 --> 01:47:10,450
We can still repair it.

1612
01:47:10,910 --> 01:47:12,590
This car belongs to 
someone close to me.

1613
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:13,630
Repair it somehow.

1614
01:47:13,660 --> 01:47:15,750
That's what I'm here for. 
Let me search for some scrap.

1615
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:19,600
Our Suran is making 
friends for that new guy.

1616
01:47:19,630 --> 01:47:20,930
Is that true? 
- Of course.

1617
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:22,270
I swear on Ambotty.

1618
01:47:22,590 --> 01:47:23,920
Attukal Suran.

1619
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:25,640
He is a fool.

1620
01:47:26,230 --> 01:47:28,940
That rascal must have lured 
him by saying something.

1621
01:47:29,310 --> 01:47:32,200
But his tricks won't work with me.

1622
01:47:32,530 --> 01:47:33,530
Hey!

1623
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:38,270
A guy has come to meet me, 
saying that he's your classmate.

1624
01:47:38,510 --> 01:47:39,510
Do you know him?

1625
01:47:41,450 --> 01:47:43,260
I know him, Dad. 
I know him really well.

1626
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:47,660
He seems to be better than your 
friends who keep barging in here.

1627
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:50,040
Did you see this?

1628
01:47:50,390 --> 01:47:51,390
It's an advance.

1629
01:47:51,580 --> 01:47:53,600
The first advance to 
work on that engine.

1630
01:47:54,350 --> 01:47:55,780
Shine! 
- What is it, boss?

1631
01:47:55,810 --> 01:47:58,040
Get a body from Vanangavadi 
Annachi in Salem.

1632
01:47:58,060 --> 01:48:00,090
Rest according to the payment schedule. 
Okay?

1633
01:48:00,120 --> 01:48:02,390
Dad, if you accept this money, 
I won't touch the tools here.

1634
01:48:02,410 --> 01:48:03,410
He said that too.

1635
01:48:04,190 --> 01:48:06,590
As your Dad, I have only 
one thing to tell you.

1636
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:10,120
A workshop mechanic shouldn't just 
learn how to repair a vehicle,

1637
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:12,020
he should learn how to 
find work in life too!

1638
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:14,710
This boy's intention is pure.

1639
01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:17,030
Instead, he didn't barge 
in here by saying lies.

1640
01:48:18,270 --> 01:48:20,290
If you leave, I'll make 
my assistants work!

1641
01:48:20,310 --> 01:48:22,080
And those vehicles would 
run on the road too!

1642
01:48:22,110 --> 01:48:23,110
Damn it!

1643
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:25,540
Get lost!

1644
01:48:26,790 --> 01:48:27,800
Then what!

1645
01:48:30,770 --> 01:48:31,770
Hey kiddo!

1646
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:33,230
Consider that money gone!

1647
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:34,960
Come.

1648
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:42,040
'You came with me'

1649
01:49:42,690 --> 01:49:44,720
'You stood within me'

1650
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:53,020
'You came with me'

1651
01:49:53,060 --> 01:49:55,310
'You stood within me'

1652
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,430
'I shall praise you, Allah'

1653
01:49:58,670 --> 01:50:01,440
'I shall praise you, Allah'

1654
01:50:03,590 --> 01:50:08,930
'You are the fingertip that reaches 
out to me when I am alone, Allah'

1655
01:50:08,970 --> 01:50:14,300
'You whisper in my ears that you're not far 
away, but standing guard for me, Allah'

1656
01:50:14,330 --> 01:50:19,590
'You are the fingertip that reaches 
out to me when I am alone, Allah'

1657
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:21,780
Did anything happen to you?

1658
01:50:21,820 --> 01:50:23,920
Just one hand of ours is 
enough for these guys!

1659
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:27,600
Thanks.

1660
01:50:30,410 --> 01:50:35,670
'My breath runs on your music, Allah'

1661
01:50:35,850 --> 01:50:41,360
'You will always shine the 
light of truth, Allah'

1662
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:46,510
'Enter my looks and words, Allah'

1663
01:51:08,010 --> 01:51:10,670
'You are the creator of the world'

1664
01:51:10,700 --> 01:51:13,280
'You are the end of sorrow'

1665
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:15,970
'You are the illusion... 
You are the magic'

1666
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:18,450
'You are the witness... 
You are everything'

1667
01:51:18,690 --> 01:51:21,340
'You are the only 
true meaning of life'

1668
01:51:21,390 --> 01:51:23,920
'You are the origin of peace'

1669
01:51:23,950 --> 01:51:26,630
'You are the illusion... 
You are the magic'

1670
01:51:26,660 --> 01:51:29,290
'You are the witness... 
You are everything'

1671
01:51:29,330 --> 01:51:34,190
'There is nothing that's 
not sacred within you'

1672
01:51:34,210 --> 01:51:39,550
'You are the fingertip that reaches 
out to me when I am alone, Allah'

1673
01:51:39,670 --> 01:51:45,000
'You whisper in my ears that you're not far 
away, but standing guard for me, Allah'

1674
01:52:04,830 --> 01:52:05,830
Dude...

1675
01:52:06,290 --> 01:52:07,290
Are you okay?

1676
01:52:08,160 --> 01:52:09,350
Hey! Tittu Samuel.

1677
01:52:09,550 --> 01:52:11,400
On your way to the buy 
the latest comic book?

1678
01:52:11,540 --> 01:52:12,540
I am okay, man!

1679
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:14,310
Athira... 
- Yes.

1680
01:52:15,970 --> 01:52:17,370
Here. 
It's her birthday today.

1681
01:52:17,390 --> 01:52:18,390
Lemon candy.

1682
01:52:19,670 --> 01:52:20,770
Dude...

1683
01:52:21,120 --> 01:52:22,960
Nothing has been okay 
there since you left.

1684
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,660
Groups, politics...

1685
01:52:26,130 --> 01:52:27,430
Our whole... 
Leave it.

1686
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:29,920
There's something I thought 
I shouldn't tell you.

1687
01:52:30,620 --> 01:52:31,690
Our Angel?

1688
01:52:34,460 --> 01:52:35,930
She is in George's trap now.

1689
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:40,070
Hey George! 
- Anna!

1690
01:52:40,090 --> 01:52:41,930
George, you're here? 
- Hop on! Let's go!

1691
01:52:42,830 --> 01:52:44,400
Let's go! Let's go! 
Come on!

1692
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,040
Let's go!

1693
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:56,510
Buying mutton for them 
from Buhari restaurant,

1694
01:52:56,540 --> 01:52:58,320
taking them for movies 
at Padmanabha theatre,

1695
01:52:58,390 --> 01:53:01,930
and buying shirts for them from Hash Bush, 
I heard you lured our boys to your side.

1696
01:53:02,220 --> 01:53:04,350
Aren't these old Gulf kid tricks?

1697
01:53:05,810 --> 01:53:07,580
I haven't touched 
you until now....

1698
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:09,430
because I gave my 
word to Nandan sir.

1699
01:53:09,850 --> 01:53:13,190
That's when I heard that you paid money 
to his Dad and got him out of there.

1700
01:53:13,730 --> 01:53:15,950
If I hear that something like 
that has happened again,

1701
01:53:16,060 --> 01:53:18,080
I'll forget the promise 
I made to Nandan sir.

1702
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:19,470
Hey! Just a minute.

1703
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:21,560
Please.

1704
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:25,900
George, congrats.

1705
01:53:26,180 --> 01:53:27,180
New bike, huh?

1706
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:28,880
Which showroom did 
you buy it from?

1707
01:53:28,970 --> 01:53:29,970
Go and get it. 
- You..!!

1708
01:53:31,580 --> 01:53:32,580
You..!!

1709
01:53:33,130 --> 01:53:34,130
You, you...!!

1710
01:53:37,850 --> 01:53:39,970
One of us, wearing 
this uniform...

1711
01:53:40,170 --> 01:53:42,970
Even if he might be a scoundrel, 
you haven't grown enough to touch him!

1712
01:53:43,340 --> 01:53:44,340
Hey! Hey!

1713
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:46,710
Didn't you understand when 
I told you once? Go! Go!

1714
01:53:47,610 --> 01:53:49,740
If you've come to study, 
you should do that.

1715
01:53:49,770 --> 01:53:51,440
Or Ambili Annan will 
have to teach you.

1716
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:11,680
'One world, one sky... 
One song that the rain sings'

1717
01:54:11,710 --> 01:54:17,080
'Aren't you the one showering 
happiness without boundaries?'

1718
01:54:17,130 --> 01:54:22,290
'Many colours, many fragrances, 
many stars, many shores'

1719
01:54:22,350 --> 01:54:27,590
'I can sense you in all of them'

1720
01:54:27,610 --> 01:54:30,130
'Are you the voice or the light?'

1721
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:32,790
'Are you the shore or the wave?'

1722
01:54:32,810 --> 01:54:35,400
'Are you a boon, 
or the mind?'

1723
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:37,800
'Are you the solace?'

1724
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:40,800
'Are you the voice or the light?'

1725
01:54:40,820 --> 01:54:43,490
'Are you the shore or the wave?'

1726
01:54:43,510 --> 01:54:46,130
'Are you a boon, 
or the mind?'

1727
01:54:46,140 --> 01:54:48,940
'Are you the solace?'

1728
01:54:48,970 --> 01:54:51,410
'Are you the voice or the light?'

1729
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:53,930
'Are you the shore or the wave?'

1730
01:54:54,010 --> 01:54:56,670
'Are you a boon, 
or the mind?'

1731
01:54:56,710 --> 01:54:59,240
'Are you the solace?'

1732
01:55:02,130 --> 01:55:03,130
Duke, come.

1733
01:55:27,150 --> 01:55:30,140
I need to meet that singer who didn't give 
him the prize for the youth festival.

1734
01:55:30,170 --> 01:55:31,170
I know his house.

1735
01:55:31,470 --> 01:55:33,460
The concert was great. 
Now there's an announcement.

1736
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:36,110
Do you know who's coming to inaugurate 
the new computer block in our school?

1737
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:37,880
Mammootty? 
- Yeah right!

1738
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:38,920
Shut up! 
- Say who it is!

1739
01:55:38,990 --> 01:55:41,740
Honourable education minister, 
Kaniyapuram Narendran.

1740
01:55:42,310 --> 01:55:43,990
Kaniyapuram? 
- Yes.

1741
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:47,540
But I didn't know about it!

1742
01:55:49,130 --> 01:55:50,130
I won't allow this.

1743
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:52,490
I won't allow him to enter the school!

1744
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,170
Bloody Kaniyapuram!

1745
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:56,150
Long live Kaniyapuram Narendran!

1746
01:55:56,190 --> 01:56:03,560
Long live Kaniyapuram Narendran!

1747
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:05,710
The minister has arrived.

1748
01:56:05,900 --> 01:56:07,380
Get the bouquet and 
garland ready.

1749
01:56:09,090 --> 01:56:10,090
Namaste sir.

1750
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:11,410
Welcome.

1751
01:56:12,330 --> 01:56:15,860
Long live Comrade Narendran.

1752
01:56:21,620 --> 01:56:23,180
Kombi, everything is okay, right?

1753
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:24,200
Okay.

1754
01:56:27,460 --> 01:56:28,880
Respected teachers,

1755
01:56:29,350 --> 01:56:32,710
and my young friends, 
the hopes of tomorrow.

1756
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:34,720
Very...

1757
01:56:35,740 --> 01:56:36,870
Narendran sir!

1758
01:56:38,950 --> 01:56:41,230
Didn't we listen to what you 
spoke for all these years?

1759
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:45,370
Now the respected minister will talk 
only after hearing what we have to say!

1760
01:56:45,810 --> 01:56:47,030
Hey! Stop! Stop!

1761
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:50,950
What's waiting for your new facelifts 
that you've spent lakhs on,

1762
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,870
are leaking roofs, shaking 
benches and wild civets.

1763
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,670
And many fund-eaters who are 
much more hungry than them.

1764
01:56:56,950 --> 01:56:58,950
When you implement new 
initiatives in this school;

1765
01:56:59,010 --> 01:57:01,300
to understand what happened 
to the earlier initiatives,

1766
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:04,210
you should spend at least 5 minutes 
to walk around this school campus.

1767
01:57:04,230 --> 01:57:05,760
What is development, sir?

1768
01:57:05,790 --> 01:57:07,710
After the developments that 
shake up our very foundations,

1769
01:57:07,730 --> 01:57:09,630
do the students here 
have a decent sports cell?

1770
01:57:09,650 --> 01:57:11,040
Do we have a band or orchestra?

1771
01:57:11,250 --> 01:57:13,430
Do we have a bus that goes 
beyond 10 kilometres?

1772
01:57:13,480 --> 01:57:16,440
Our school is an open toilet 
where we have to pee in the open.

1773
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:20,340
When the children of the colony 
below us drink arrack,

1774
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:24,010
by selling our staircases, windows and 
parts of the vehicles that come here,

1775
01:57:24,050 --> 01:57:26,260
it's us students of the science 
club, who go to question them!

1776
01:57:26,290 --> 01:57:28,840
We have a bad reputation of starting 
fights at the drop of a hat.

1777
01:57:28,870 --> 01:57:29,950
We swear on our mothers, 
we would!

1778
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:32,120
That's because we see the 
daylight robbery happening here.

1779
01:57:32,180 --> 01:57:34,030
There are people who 
slap the students here,

1780
01:57:34,050 --> 01:57:37,850
because his breakfast didn't have enough 
salt, or because his wife had a long face.

1781
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:41,190
We're not saying that anyone 
should come hug or kiss us.

1782
01:57:41,210 --> 01:57:42,930
Can't you stop seeing 
us as enemies?

1783
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:46,540
After money-lending, chewing betel-leaves 
and other side businesses,

1784
01:57:46,590 --> 01:57:48,920
if they have time, there will 
be a ritual called class!

1785
01:57:49,220 --> 01:57:51,760
60% of them are conducting 
private tuitions outside!

1786
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:53,120
Shouldn't all this end?

1787
01:57:53,160 --> 01:57:56,720
Even if we adjust to all this, 
the problems are never going to stop.

1788
01:57:56,740 --> 01:58:00,340
Every campus should be a mirror that 
reflects the happenings in the world.

1789
01:58:00,370 --> 01:58:02,940
There's no point in 
proclaiming 147 here, sir.

1790
01:58:02,970 --> 01:58:06,520
We're not taught discipline and 
schooled to be the hopes of tomorrow.

1791
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:09,270
Either we'd be sitting at some 
village office and scribbling stuff,

1792
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:14,340
otherwise we'd be doing unskilled labour 
at other states, with heavy hearts.

1793
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:16,980
Apart from that, no miracles 
are going to happen here, sir.

1794
01:58:17,350 --> 01:58:19,880
When the school bus that was built 
by the students was burned,

1795
01:58:19,930 --> 01:58:21,050
and we came to inform you,

1796
01:58:21,080 --> 01:58:24,620
your personal secretary, Krishnan Kutty, 
said that we'll be given a compensation.

1797
01:58:24,770 --> 01:58:26,210
That case hasn't reached anywhere.

1798
01:58:26,270 --> 01:58:29,080
A document containing all the 
developments that this school requires...

1799
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:31,970
When we went to present that, 
no one had the time to meet us.

1800
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:35,240
We have taken a decision here today.

1801
01:58:35,690 --> 01:58:37,810
If you want to leave this campus today,

1802
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:40,680
you should accept our petition, 
sign it and then go.

1803
01:58:42,710 --> 01:58:46,650
Or else, if you want to use the police 
or army, we're ready even for that.

1804
01:58:50,130 --> 01:58:51,870
Mr. Kaniyapuram Narendran,

1805
01:58:51,970 --> 01:58:53,930
will not leave from here today.

1806
01:58:54,210 --> 01:58:55,510
That is our decision.

1807
01:58:57,340 --> 01:58:58,890
Long live the revolution!

1808
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:01,690
Long live the revolution!

1809
01:59:02,950 --> 01:59:07,340
Long live the revolution!

1810
01:59:08,700 --> 01:59:10,360
Long live the revolution!

1811
01:59:10,820 --> 01:59:14,410
I don't need the help of a 
microphone to speak here.

1812
01:59:15,410 --> 01:59:16,410
Because,

1813
01:59:16,530 --> 01:59:19,390
every wall of this school, 
can recognize my voice.

1814
01:59:20,010 --> 01:59:22,240
Kaniyapuram Narendran started 
standing on his two legs,

1815
01:59:22,270 --> 01:59:25,910
by hoisting the flag as the 
unit secretary of this school.

1816
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:29,340
If I know how to enter this place,

1817
01:59:29,970 --> 01:59:33,280
you don't have to teach me 
how to leave from here.

1818
01:59:33,370 --> 01:59:34,370
Understood?

1819
01:59:49,250 --> 01:59:51,780
I will answer everything 
that you asked me just now.

1820
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:54,080
Not through words, 
but through action.

1821
01:59:54,530 --> 01:59:58,330
It's not like I don't 
know how to go about it.

1822
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:01,350
Have you seen the children 
of Idukki & Wayanad,

1823
02:00:01,380 --> 02:00:04,930
who go to study, by swimming across rivers, 
and walking through forests & fields?

1824
02:00:05,780 --> 02:00:08,130
Have you seen the 
glow in their eyes?

1825
02:00:09,790 --> 02:00:12,540
Have you seen the pain in 
the hearts of the children,

1826
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:15,480
who stay in the colony below 
the many acres of your campus?

1827
02:00:18,450 --> 02:00:20,920
There are children who are much 
more underprivileged than you,

1828
02:00:20,950 --> 02:00:23,600
who study lighting their chimneys 
with their meager daily wages,

1829
02:00:23,620 --> 02:00:25,200
and come first, in Kerala.

1830
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:30,470
I'm not someone who got a 
dress stitched and ironed,

1831
02:00:30,500 --> 02:00:33,150
and stepped out to become the 
education minister, one fine morning.

1832
02:00:34,830 --> 02:00:36,720
A society that elected me, 
by voting for me,

1833
02:00:36,740 --> 02:00:40,910
with the strong belief that I 
would always be there for them.

1834
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:44,020
My party that has the 
colour of my blood.

1835
02:00:44,470 --> 02:00:46,180
Both are with me.

1836
02:00:48,200 --> 02:00:50,080
I will place a challenge before you.

1837
02:00:52,100 --> 02:00:54,720
I will implement your master 
plan not just in this school,

1838
02:00:55,030 --> 02:00:59,310
but in the Government schools 
in all 14 districts of Kerala.

1839
02:00:59,510 --> 02:01:00,510
That's my word.

1840
02:01:02,890 --> 02:01:04,140
The 12 of you...

1841
02:01:04,700 --> 02:01:09,380
should score marks not below 40%, 
in the upcoming public exam.

1842
02:01:10,070 --> 02:01:11,930
You do your duty well.

1843
02:01:12,260 --> 02:01:14,130
Come and teach me, after that!

1844
02:01:19,950 --> 02:01:20,950
Move!

1845
02:01:25,500 --> 02:01:27,430
Even if you fail in the exam,

1846
02:01:28,110 --> 02:01:29,890
he will implement this plan.

1847
02:01:31,780 --> 02:01:33,820
Then all its credit would go to him.

1848
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:38,460
But if he implements it 
because you've passed,

1849
02:01:39,110 --> 02:01:41,960
its credit would belong only to you.

1850
02:01:42,470 --> 02:01:43,470
So...

1851
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:46,210
he'll go to any extent to stop 
you from passing the exams.

1852
02:01:47,050 --> 02:01:49,920
Don't expect any leniency in the 
evaluation of the answer sheets.

1853
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:53,420
They wouldn't have to 
work too hard for that.

1854
02:01:53,740 --> 02:01:57,220
They themselves would happily 
fulfill his expectation.

1855
02:01:57,400 --> 02:01:58,400
Why did you say so, sir?

1856
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:01,200
This is not the time for arguments!

1857
02:02:01,470 --> 02:02:03,820
If you pass, that will 
become a new history here.

1858
02:02:04,100 --> 02:02:06,610
Can there be any change 
in this group of 12?

1859
02:02:06,650 --> 02:02:08,770
You should have thought about 
it before showing off!

1860
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:12,050
You start shouting slogans of revolution 
at the drop of a hat, right?

1861
02:02:12,450 --> 02:02:16,550
Prove that exams and education 
have a place in politics, Abhayan.

1862
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:25,700
We won't fail! We won't fail! 
Model school won't fail!

1863
02:02:25,720 --> 02:02:30,970
We won't fail! We won't fail! 
Model school won't fail!

1864
02:02:31,080 --> 02:02:32,320
You should pass, brother.

1865
02:02:32,570 --> 02:02:34,460
Whatever you do, 
you have to pass.

1866
02:02:35,070 --> 02:02:36,780
Bro, the kids are all quite excited.

1867
02:02:36,860 --> 02:02:38,880
Seems like we're really trapped!

1868
02:02:45,770 --> 02:02:48,040
Now he has kicked the 
ball into our post!

1869
02:02:48,070 --> 02:02:49,070
40%?

1870
02:02:49,090 --> 02:02:50,750
Is that even possible, oh God?

1871
02:02:51,080 --> 02:02:53,380
We're trapped, bro! 
- Catch!

1872
02:02:53,460 --> 02:02:55,100
We must win this game somehow.

1873
02:02:55,660 --> 02:02:57,830
I just had to score pass 
marks to go to the Gulf.

1874
02:02:57,950 --> 02:02:59,440
If we study really hard, 
we can do it.

1875
02:02:59,470 --> 02:03:00,470
Catch!

1876
02:03:06,270 --> 02:03:08,630
I wish there was a crash course 
we could attend to study quickly.

1877
02:03:08,650 --> 02:03:10,720
That's going to be 
really expensive, bro.

1878
02:03:10,750 --> 02:03:12,490
Where are you throwing it to? 
- Go and get it.

1879
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:22,080
There is one way.

1880
02:03:22,950 --> 02:03:24,790
I know someone who can help us.

1881
02:03:26,710 --> 02:03:27,790
Damn it.

1882
02:03:28,070 --> 02:03:29,070
Come.

1883
02:03:34,780 --> 02:03:35,780
Bro!

1884
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:37,850
If it doesn't cost us money, 
why don't we try it?

1885
02:03:46,050 --> 02:03:47,200
What did you guys think?

1886
02:03:47,580 --> 02:03:49,880
That I make my living by 
selling guides for exams?

1887
02:03:50,830 --> 02:03:52,180
First of all,

1888
02:03:52,590 --> 02:03:56,040
this whole tradition of 
exams itself is outdated.

1889
02:03:56,460 --> 02:03:58,720
If you write many answers 
by studying them by heart,

1890
02:03:58,740 --> 02:04:01,610
according to a syllabus 
created by someone,

1891
02:04:02,430 --> 02:04:05,460
the system will give 
you plenty of marks,

1892
02:04:05,690 --> 02:04:07,500
evaluate you liberally,

1893
02:04:07,570 --> 02:04:08,570
and make you pass.

1894
02:04:08,870 --> 02:04:10,010
Or it would make you fail.

1895
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:13,410
What's the point in doing that?

1896
02:04:14,580 --> 02:04:16,190
That does not interest me at all.

1897
02:04:16,450 --> 02:04:21,500
So, in this matter, I cannot help not 
just you, but anyone in this world.

1898
02:04:25,060 --> 02:04:27,610
But in your case, 
we have to defeat that system.

1899
02:04:28,380 --> 02:04:29,380
Because,

1900
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:32,370
the plan that you guys made... 
That is democratic!

1901
02:04:33,160 --> 02:04:35,530
The pass mark that you need 
to get it implemented...

1902
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:38,720
I'll help you score that.

1903
02:04:42,810 --> 02:04:44,150
I have 3 conditions.

1904
02:04:44,370 --> 02:04:45,370
One.

1905
02:04:45,660 --> 02:04:47,590
I will teach you only 
when I feel like it.

1906
02:04:48,090 --> 02:04:51,480
And I cannot come to a place you 
choose, or at a time you choose.

1907
02:04:52,100 --> 02:04:55,870
Instead, if your guardians permit you, 
you can stay here...

1908
02:04:56,550 --> 02:04:58,230
following the rules of this place.

1909
02:04:59,410 --> 02:05:00,410
Two.

1910
02:05:00,430 --> 02:05:01,660
I have only one goal.

1911
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:03,790
I will make you guys 
pass the exams.

1912
02:05:04,190 --> 02:05:05,960
Don't ask me how and when!

1913
02:05:06,970 --> 02:05:10,060
I'll shave off the heads and play drums 
on the heads of those who act smart!

1914
02:05:11,350 --> 02:05:12,450
Complete submission.

1915
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:15,700
Apart from that, you can ask 
me any sensible question!

1916
02:05:16,360 --> 02:05:18,010
If I know the answer, 
I'll tell you.

1917
02:05:18,390 --> 02:05:20,260
Or I'll bring someone who knows it, 
before you.

1918
02:05:21,290 --> 02:05:22,290
Three.

1919
02:05:24,260 --> 02:05:27,120
This service is not free, boys! 
It's not free!

1920
02:05:27,580 --> 02:05:28,930
There will be a fee for this.

1921
02:05:29,560 --> 02:05:32,040
I'll collect it according 
to each one's capacity.

1922
02:05:32,490 --> 02:05:34,260
This a deal between each 
of us, individually.

1923
02:05:34,290 --> 02:05:35,290
Are you okay with it?

1924
02:05:36,150 --> 02:05:37,590
Think about it and let me know.

1925
02:05:41,580 --> 02:05:44,740
No. Let's go. 
We don't need this.

1926
02:05:45,790 --> 02:05:46,790
Sorry bro.

1927
02:05:47,190 --> 02:05:49,860
We agreed to this only because 
you asked us to come.

1928
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:51,970
He thinks he's a prince, Suran. 
Let's go.

1929
02:05:52,440 --> 02:05:53,590
Shall we leave, Susan aunty?

1930
02:05:53,740 --> 02:05:55,070
What are you saying?

1931
02:05:55,630 --> 02:05:59,000
After preparing a feast 
for so many people,

1932
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:01,990
should I throw away everything 
that's on the stove? No way!

1933
02:06:02,060 --> 02:06:03,280
Leave only after eating. 
Here.

1934
02:06:03,340 --> 02:06:05,200
Hold this and give it to everyone.

1935
02:06:06,580 --> 02:06:07,580
Move! Move!

1936
02:06:09,070 --> 02:06:10,210
Please. 
Shall we eat?

1937
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:12,470
Let's have a silent prayer then.

1938
02:06:12,490 --> 02:06:14,770
Brother, we cannot pray silently.

1939
02:06:14,950 --> 02:06:19,260
Our Father, for this day, for our 
friends, for this food, we thank Thee.

1940
02:06:19,260 --> 02:06:20,570
Okay.

1941
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:22,830
This is a ritual in 
our Palayckal house.

1942
02:06:24,110 --> 02:06:26,040
We should provide abundant 
food for everyone.

1943
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:28,900
We should take rest, 
and make our guests rest too.

1944
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:31,070
And we need to serve one person.

1945
02:06:33,700 --> 02:06:35,350
Okay? 
So go ahead.

1946
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:36,500
Enjoy your food.

1947
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:39,390
Beef Aavikkizhi, Crab roast, Duck Mappas,

1948
02:06:39,420 --> 02:06:41,980
Tiger Prawns, Boiled Pearl Spot, 
Roasted prawns,

1949
02:06:42,050 --> 02:06:44,060
Chicken curry and 
many more are there.

1950
02:06:44,080 --> 02:06:46,260
But no one should leave 
without having desserts.

1951
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:47,920
All the desserts are special items.

1952
02:06:48,460 --> 02:06:51,070
Hey! Get me the plate. 
- Get me the beef.

1953
02:06:51,100 --> 02:06:53,750
Boys! Boys! 
Hey!

1954
02:06:53,850 --> 02:06:55,850
The hall...

1955
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,370
Since the hall doesn't have enough space,

1956
02:06:58,650 --> 02:07:02,040
we're planning to accommodate 
you in 3 AC rooms upstairs.

1957
02:07:02,260 --> 02:07:03,470
AC in all rooms, dude! 
- Okay?

1958
02:07:03,490 --> 02:07:05,550
If you need anything else, 
you should tell me now.

1959
02:07:13,690 --> 02:07:14,690
So you've decided!

1960
02:07:15,520 --> 02:07:16,520
Are you sure?

1961
02:07:19,370 --> 02:07:20,370
Yes, sir.

1962
02:07:20,590 --> 02:07:22,990
A disciplined body, 
mind and intellect.

1963
02:07:24,010 --> 02:07:27,830
Only if you have all these, you will have 
the capability to answer the questions.

1964
02:07:29,050 --> 02:07:30,240
Sabu... 
- Brother.

1965
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:32,200
Train them.

1966
02:07:36,260 --> 02:07:37,710
Let their brains become warm first.

1967
02:07:37,850 --> 02:07:39,280
What? - Brain. 
- How?

1968
02:07:39,810 --> 02:07:40,990
Studies can wait until then.

1969
02:07:42,470 --> 02:07:44,850
Shekharan, lock that gate.

1970
02:07:44,930 --> 02:07:46,050
Shall we start?

1971
02:07:46,280 --> 02:07:48,110
10 rounds around this campus.

1972
02:07:48,130 --> 02:07:49,130
That's the beginning.

1973
02:07:50,690 --> 02:07:52,050
Oh my God! 
A dog?

1974
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:55,760
I can't climb this.

1975
02:07:55,780 --> 02:07:58,150
I'll help those 
who cannot climb.

1976
02:07:58,470 --> 02:07:59,470
Climb!

1977
02:08:00,950 --> 02:08:02,810
You've been hanging for too long! 
Climb!

1978
02:08:08,530 --> 02:08:10,870
You have two tasks 
before you now.

1979
02:08:10,890 --> 02:08:15,260
Collect all the dried leaves on 
this field and put it in one place.

1980
02:08:15,930 --> 02:08:16,930
Come here.

1981
02:08:17,190 --> 02:08:18,310
Move this side.

1982
02:08:18,530 --> 02:08:19,530
Listen!

1983
02:08:20,260 --> 02:08:24,310
Secondly, collect one bucket 
of water each from that well,

1984
02:08:24,350 --> 02:08:26,770
and pour it under each 
tree here, every morning.

1985
02:08:26,790 --> 02:08:28,350
Sir, I'm scared of water. 
That's why.

1986
02:08:28,370 --> 02:08:30,500
Go and get water. 
Don't interrupt others' work.

1987
02:08:33,780 --> 02:08:35,040
Take it there.

1988
02:08:35,060 --> 02:08:37,750
Suran, it's evening and they haven't 
even given us a drop of water.

1989
02:08:38,370 --> 02:08:39,820
The kitchen here 
closed yesterday.

1990
02:08:39,930 --> 02:08:43,320
That aunty said that the kitchen would 
open again only during the next season.

1991
02:08:44,170 --> 02:08:46,010
Let's live by eating the 
jack fruits and mangoes here.

1992
02:08:46,050 --> 02:08:47,180
Get lost, you veggie!

1993
02:08:48,830 --> 02:08:50,000
Okay, right? 
- Okay.

1994
02:08:50,230 --> 02:08:51,670
From this point to that point.

1995
02:08:51,930 --> 02:08:52,930
Okay? 
Come on.

1996
02:08:53,970 --> 02:08:54,970
Climb on it.

1997
02:08:56,430 --> 02:08:58,040
Those who have fallen, 
climb again.

1998
02:08:58,070 --> 02:08:59,130
Climb. 
Come on, swim.

1999
02:08:59,160 --> 02:09:00,830
Go to that side and 
start all over again.

2000
02:09:01,420 --> 02:09:02,420
Come on!

2001
02:09:05,690 --> 02:09:06,690
Come! Come!

2002
02:09:06,900 --> 02:09:09,150
Come on! 
- Looks like he'll fall now.

2003
02:09:09,170 --> 02:09:11,190
One by one! 
- There he goes!

2004
02:09:15,010 --> 02:09:17,450
Sir, we did whatever 
you asked us to do.

2005
02:09:17,900 --> 02:09:20,090
Now we don't have any 
hesitation to do anything.

2006
02:09:20,530 --> 02:09:23,200
But there aren't many days 
left for the exams to start.

2007
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:31,230
There is only one way now, 
to make each one of you pass.

2008
02:09:31,850 --> 02:09:34,800
Many intellectuals and 
criminals in the world,

2009
02:09:35,330 --> 02:09:37,040
without any gender differences,

2010
02:09:37,320 --> 02:09:40,070
have tried and been 
successful at least once,

2011
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:41,700
at this golden technique.

2012
02:09:42,620 --> 02:09:43,620
Keep secret notes.

2013
02:09:43,650 --> 02:09:45,650
What did you say he was in America? 
- Professor.

2014
02:09:45,680 --> 02:09:46,870
Didn't understand, right?

2015
02:09:47,180 --> 02:09:49,260
Not just the questions 
that may be asked.

2016
02:09:49,850 --> 02:09:51,430
Entire textbooks!

2017
02:09:52,050 --> 02:09:53,740
On tiny bits of paper,

2018
02:09:54,060 --> 02:09:55,540
write in the smallest letters,

2019
02:09:55,670 --> 02:09:56,930
fold it, roll it,

2020
02:09:57,450 --> 02:10:01,910
and keep them safely in places where even the 
thousand-eyed Lord Indra can't find them.

2021
02:10:02,790 --> 02:10:05,960
As soon as you see the question, 
without any space for doubts,

2022
02:10:06,440 --> 02:10:08,500
take out the note carefully. 
Write the exam!

2023
02:10:08,530 --> 02:10:09,690
Isn't that wrong, sir?

2024
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:12,290
Don't answer back!

2025
02:10:14,610 --> 02:10:16,370
Though it may seem 
simple when you hear it,

2026
02:10:16,970 --> 02:10:19,000
you're not keeping any 
ordinary secret notes.

2027
02:10:19,750 --> 02:10:24,010
Each of you should make your 
notes in your own handwriting.

2028
02:10:24,790 --> 02:10:27,020
I'll check the quality of the notes, 
and approve them.

2029
02:10:27,780 --> 02:10:28,800
Start writing!

2030
02:10:31,150 --> 02:10:33,460
Seek and you shall find!

2031
02:10:35,150 --> 02:10:36,430
Disperse!

2032
02:10:36,790 --> 02:10:37,960
Come on, go!

2033
02:10:38,830 --> 02:10:39,830
What did he say?

2034
02:10:40,350 --> 02:10:42,530
Bro, leave this to us.

2035
02:10:42,580 --> 02:10:43,700
We'll take care of this.

2036
02:10:43,900 --> 02:10:46,810
We'll give you an unforgettable 
experience within 15 days.

2037
02:10:47,240 --> 02:10:48,300
I'm thankful, bro.

2038
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:50,080
This is quite an 
unforgettable experience.

2039
02:10:50,100 --> 02:10:54,350
The transfer of pollen grains 
from the anther to the stigma,

2040
02:10:54,370 --> 02:10:56,590
of a flower is called pollination.

2041
02:10:56,690 --> 02:10:58,790
Hey! If you've finished writing, 
put it in this.

2042
02:10:59,710 --> 02:11:02,030
Okay. Lymphocytes are 
taken from patients' blood.

2043
02:11:02,060 --> 02:11:04,190
Isn't this over yet? 
- The entire textbook is there, man.

2044
02:11:04,210 --> 02:11:06,750
Along with this, there are 4 more chapters. 
- Four?

2045
02:11:06,780 --> 02:11:07,840
Brother...

2046
02:11:07,900 --> 02:11:10,120
The boys have brought 
the secret notes.

2047
02:11:10,160 --> 02:11:11,160
Where? 
- Here.

2048
02:11:11,860 --> 02:11:12,860
Are these secret notes?

2049
02:11:13,590 --> 02:11:16,510
If they write it so big 
in such large papers,

2050
02:11:16,550 --> 02:11:18,340
where are they going to hide it?

2051
02:11:18,610 --> 02:11:20,490
Do one thing. 
Tear all that off...

2052
02:11:21,380 --> 02:11:24,850
and write it in tiny letters, 
in tiny bits of paper.

2053
02:11:24,880 --> 02:11:25,990
It's the lake in front of us,

2054
02:11:26,020 --> 02:11:27,280
and behind us, 
is the guy from America.

2055
02:11:27,310 --> 02:11:29,160
And we're in the middle, 
working and starving!

2056
02:11:29,180 --> 02:11:30,910
Will he burn it even if we 
write it smaller than this?

2057
02:11:30,950 --> 02:11:32,270
If we don't write it, 
he'll burn us.

2058
02:11:32,400 --> 02:11:33,790
What's happening? 
Did you write it?

2059
02:11:34,250 --> 02:11:35,710
Yes. 
- How did you write it?

2060
02:11:35,730 --> 02:11:37,610
In our own handwritings...

2061
02:11:38,820 --> 02:11:40,090
How did I ask you to write it?

2062
02:11:40,110 --> 02:11:42,510
These are secret notes 
of entire text books,

2063
02:11:42,530 --> 02:11:45,820
prepared by each one 
of us, written in our own handwritings.

2064
02:11:46,890 --> 02:11:48,090
How did I ask you to write it?

2065
02:11:48,120 --> 02:11:49,220
To make it small...

2066
02:11:49,590 --> 02:11:50,790
How did I ask you to write it?

2067
02:11:50,950 --> 02:11:52,300
To write in tiny letters...

2068
02:11:52,350 --> 02:11:53,740
Have you written in tiny letters?

2069
02:11:53,770 --> 02:11:55,570
No. 
- Then what should you do?

2070
02:11:55,850 --> 02:11:57,520
We should write it again, 
in tiny letters.

2071
02:11:57,840 --> 02:11:58,840
Then go and write it.

2072
02:11:58,950 --> 02:12:00,190
Phew!

2073
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:03,490
If we don't pass this exam...

2074
02:12:05,230 --> 02:12:06,230
It will all happen!

2075
02:12:06,490 --> 02:12:07,490
Trust me.

2076
02:12:14,690 --> 02:12:16,920
You've hidden everything you've 
written properly, right?

2077
02:12:17,310 --> 02:12:19,060
Don't get caught at any cost.

2078
02:12:19,650 --> 02:12:21,550
If this technique has to work out,

2079
02:12:22,210 --> 02:12:26,150
don't copy from your neighbour's 
secret note or answer sheet.

2080
02:12:27,250 --> 02:12:29,490
Seek from your own secret 
notes and you shall find!

2081
02:12:30,690 --> 02:12:31,690
Understood?

2082
02:12:34,410 --> 02:12:35,410
Dude, look.

2083
02:12:37,820 --> 02:12:38,820
Did you study?

2084
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:40,630
Look! 
They are studying!

2085
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:42,400
Study, guys!

2086
02:12:42,450 --> 02:12:44,270
Ask if you have any doubts. 
We'll tell you.

2087
02:12:44,300 --> 02:12:46,620
We'll tell you everything. 
Sit there and study!

2088
02:12:46,650 --> 02:12:48,650
Everything is okay, right? 
- What? Can't you go?

2089
02:12:48,850 --> 02:12:51,360
Trivikraman... 
- 'Oh my mother earth, for your near death'

2090
02:12:52,060 --> 02:12:54,960
'I am singing this poem “may 
your soul rest in peace.”'

2091
02:12:55,530 --> 02:12:56,530
Boys...

2092
02:12:56,640 --> 02:12:58,190
Come to the light.

2093
02:12:58,800 --> 02:13:00,140
Let him come to the light first.

2094
02:13:00,230 --> 02:13:04,810
A special invigilator appointed 
directly by the minister...

2095
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:08,800
is coming to throw away 
all the secret notes

2096
02:13:08,850 --> 02:13:11,610
you've expertly hidden in 
various parts of your body.

2097
02:13:11,900 --> 02:13:12,900
Beware!

2098
02:13:12,950 --> 02:13:14,930
Here comes that tornado!

2099
02:13:15,710 --> 02:13:17,520
Seek God's blessings!

2100
02:13:37,430 --> 02:13:38,430
Welcome, sir.

2101
02:13:38,870 --> 02:13:40,400
The school is all yours.

2102
02:13:41,140 --> 02:13:42,250
Nice Kurta.

2103
02:13:42,990 --> 02:13:44,950
The first bell will be at 9 AM sharp.

2104
02:13:45,030 --> 02:13:46,380
At 12 PM, they should be out.

2105
02:13:46,710 --> 02:13:48,680
None of your teaching staff 
should be present

2106
02:13:48,710 --> 02:13:50,870
in the hall where those 12 
students are sitting.

2107
02:13:51,130 --> 02:13:52,970
Now let me do my duty. 
- Certainly.

2108
02:13:54,590 --> 02:13:56,910
None of their games will 
work with Sudheer sir.

2109
02:14:02,450 --> 02:14:04,780
Minister Narendran is really particular...

2110
02:14:05,150 --> 02:14:08,390
that none of you should score even 
one mark more than what you deserve.

2111
02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:12,320
Whoever commits a malpractice,

2112
02:14:12,990 --> 02:14:14,630
I'll change his horoscope.

2113
02:14:15,660 --> 02:14:18,280
It's better to surrender 
before the war starts.

2114
02:14:19,410 --> 02:14:22,510
Only God can save you 
in this exam now.

2115
02:14:23,820 --> 02:14:24,820
Move.

2116
02:15:22,420 --> 02:15:23,420
Stand up.

2117
02:15:24,830 --> 02:15:26,190
Come out. 
- Sir?

2118
02:15:26,260 --> 02:15:27,260
Come out, man.

2119
02:15:28,250 --> 02:15:30,110
Why are you wearing 
slippers in two colours?

2120
02:15:31,070 --> 02:15:33,200
They got switched when I came 
out of the temple, sir.

2121
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:34,920
Remove it.

2122
02:15:39,890 --> 02:15:41,090
What is this sticker?

2123
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:42,640
It got torn, sir.

2124
02:15:42,740 --> 02:15:44,390
Poor thing. 
Remove that sticker.

2125
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:47,460
It's not coming off, sir. 
The glue is really strong.

2126
02:15:49,310 --> 02:15:50,460
Open it.

2127
02:15:51,960 --> 02:15:53,800
What is this? 
This is not mine, sir.

2128
02:15:54,450 --> 02:15:55,450
You stand up!

2129
02:15:57,730 --> 02:15:58,730
You stand up!

2130
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:02,400
You stand up!

2131
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:04,650
Me? 
- All of you, come.

2132
02:16:04,990 --> 02:16:07,000
What is your name? 
- Suran.

2133
02:16:07,090 --> 02:16:08,090
Attukal Suran.

2134
02:16:08,150 --> 02:16:09,220
Attukal Suran?

2135
02:16:09,800 --> 02:16:11,080
Are you a singer or what?

2136
02:16:11,150 --> 02:16:12,530
No sir. 
I'm a ballet drama artiste.

2137
02:16:12,760 --> 02:16:14,260
Open that slipper 
and show everyone.

2138
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:17,420
You saw his footwear?

2139
02:16:18,340 --> 02:16:21,220
All three of them have 
such stuff with them.

2140
02:16:21,270 --> 02:16:22,800
No, sir. 
We don't have anything.

2141
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:24,190
No? 
- We haven't done anything like that.

2142
02:16:24,220 --> 02:16:25,210
What is this then?

2143
02:16:25,880 --> 02:16:27,670
Sir, I had tied it 
around my broken nail.

2144
02:16:29,730 --> 02:16:30,730
Oh God, save me!

2145
02:16:31,230 --> 02:16:32,810
Nothing else, right?

2146
02:16:33,090 --> 02:16:34,920
Sir, the cloth... 
- Your hand....

2147
02:16:36,190 --> 02:16:38,220
Your neck is also hiding something!

2148
02:16:38,850 --> 02:16:39,850
That's all, sir.

2149
02:16:40,500 --> 02:16:41,800
What's inside? 
- The sacred thread, sir.

2150
02:16:41,830 --> 02:16:43,540
Sacred thread? - Yes. 
- Remove your buttons.

2151
02:16:44,960 --> 02:16:45,960
Remove the buttons.

2152
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:47,950
There was a prayer meet, sir.

2153
02:16:47,980 --> 02:16:48,980
Yeah right!

2154
02:16:50,110 --> 02:16:51,110
You saw it?

2155
02:16:51,580 --> 02:16:53,050
Is this your prayer?

2156
02:16:53,360 --> 02:16:55,620
I wrote it so that I won't forget. 
- Not to forget?

2157
02:16:56,100 --> 02:16:57,220
Come here. 
- There's nothing, sir.

2158
02:16:57,250 --> 02:16:58,250
Come here, I say!

2159
02:16:59,500 --> 02:17:00,500
Move your hands.

2160
02:17:04,790 --> 02:17:05,790
Did you see this, sir?

2161
02:17:05,980 --> 02:17:07,790
Is this their skill 
that you praised?

2162
02:17:07,810 --> 02:17:09,650
This is utter cheating, sir.

2163
02:17:09,680 --> 02:17:11,490
What is this?

2164
02:17:11,540 --> 02:17:15,080
Since they haven't written even one line 
from these secret notes,

2165
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:16,760
I am giving you one more chance.

2166
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:19,370
It's not my charity to 
this school's headmaster.

2167
02:17:19,850 --> 02:17:22,250
It's only because you 
made a request to me.

2168
02:17:23,220 --> 02:17:26,700
Can you give me a hall big enough 
to place these 12 at 12 edges?

2169
02:17:28,770 --> 02:17:30,480
Say yes, sir. 
- Don't say yes, sir.

2170
02:17:36,010 --> 02:17:38,570
This is your last chance.

2171
02:17:39,210 --> 02:17:45,210
If I suspect that even one of you is 
performing malpractice of any kind,

2172
02:17:45,230 --> 02:17:48,060
all 12 of you would 
be thrown out.

2173
02:17:49,850 --> 02:17:51,420
Your time starts now.

2174
02:17:51,440 --> 02:17:52,860
Come on! 
Start writing.

2175
02:17:53,280 --> 02:17:54,280
What do we write!

2176
02:17:54,760 --> 02:17:55,760
Oops.

2177
02:17:55,780 --> 02:17:56,880
Sir, I've started writing.

2178
02:17:57,080 --> 02:17:58,080
Silence!

2179
02:18:02,060 --> 02:18:05,770
It is when we forget all 
expectations and lose all hopes,

2180
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:08,440
that the hands of God 
would intervene.

2181
02:18:09,090 --> 02:18:11,360
In that classroom where those 
12 students were sitting,

2182
02:18:11,750 --> 02:18:14,680
imbibing prayers from all 
the students of that school,

2183
02:18:15,350 --> 02:18:19,060
a huge miracle had commenced, 
without their knowledge.

2184
02:18:20,830 --> 02:18:23,200
Seek and you shall find!

2185
02:18:33,650 --> 02:18:37,320
Among you, there must be people who fell on 
their heads, and people who tripped & fell.

2186
02:18:37,530 --> 02:18:39,790
Basically, it happened because 
you didn't have balance.

2187
02:18:40,190 --> 02:18:44,130
Torque is the idea of 
balancing the act.

2188
02:18:44,710 --> 02:18:48,550
Depending upon the centre of mass moving 
above or below the supporting level,

2189
02:18:48,580 --> 02:18:50,610
you will trip, and fall too.

2190
02:18:51,650 --> 02:18:54,390
Seek, and you shall find it.

2191
02:19:17,750 --> 02:19:20,920
If you apply force from this 
focal point of this ellipse,

2192
02:19:21,630 --> 02:19:24,110
it will reflect from the 
second focal point.

2193
02:19:24,180 --> 02:19:26,160
That's why the coin fell there. 
Try.

2194
02:19:48,350 --> 02:19:52,650
Brother, they have somehow collected 
all the dry leaves on this field.

2195
02:19:53,370 --> 02:19:55,180
But that's not your task.

2196
02:19:56,180 --> 02:19:57,570
Then what is it? 
- Burn it.

2197
02:19:58,200 --> 02:20:00,160
Sir, can I get a match box? 
I'll burn it quickly.

2198
02:20:00,180 --> 02:20:02,310
Match-box is science! 
Real men invented it.

2199
02:20:02,370 --> 02:20:03,370
Right, brother?

2200
02:20:03,550 --> 02:20:05,480
Man should learn how 
to make a fire first.

2201
02:20:07,050 --> 02:20:08,050
Make it.

2202
02:20:08,070 --> 02:20:09,070
How do we make it?

2203
02:20:10,230 --> 02:20:11,230
Rub stones, man!

2204
02:20:20,790 --> 02:20:22,500
Principle of converging lens.

2205
02:20:30,060 --> 02:20:33,260
Only half the force that you use to 
lift a bucket of water is needed,

2206
02:20:33,330 --> 02:20:34,730
if you use a pulley.

2207
02:20:35,550 --> 02:20:37,160
So if you use three pulleys,

2208
02:20:38,980 --> 02:20:40,160
it will reduce even further.

2209
02:20:40,750 --> 02:20:42,830
That's the advantage of a simple machine.

2210
02:20:43,300 --> 02:20:44,300
Take it.

2211
02:20:46,860 --> 02:20:47,860
Hurry up!

2212
02:20:47,890 --> 02:20:49,160
10 minutes to go!

2213
02:20:49,810 --> 02:20:50,980
Just a minute, sir.

2214
02:21:28,170 --> 02:21:29,670
Finished writing, Ayyappan? 
- Listen.

2215
02:21:33,580 --> 02:21:35,070
All exams are over.

2216
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:37,530
I received your answer 
sheets as well.

2217
02:21:37,990 --> 02:21:42,430
There's someone who's sure that your 
efforts & prayers would succeed.

2218
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:44,200
Sudheer Kumar.

2219
02:21:44,620 --> 02:21:46,530
Roll No. 36, 10 A.

2220
02:21:48,190 --> 02:21:49,430
Don't know who he is, right?

2221
02:21:50,560 --> 02:21:51,560
It's me.

2222
02:21:53,220 --> 02:21:56,440
Someone who loves his school, 
just like you.

2223
02:21:56,920 --> 02:21:58,420
1971 batch.

2224
02:21:59,440 --> 02:22:00,590
And yeah, one more thing.

2225
02:22:00,860 --> 02:22:06,100
You know who told me that you have secret 
notes with you, and I should remove them?

2226
02:22:06,700 --> 02:22:09,540
It's the same person who asked 
you to make secret notes

2227
02:22:09,560 --> 02:22:12,480
of entire text books, 
writing it in tiny letters.

2228
02:22:15,020 --> 02:22:16,860
John Abraham Palayckal.

2229
02:22:18,220 --> 02:22:21,110
We understood why you made 
us do all that we did here,

2230
02:22:21,140 --> 02:22:23,680
only when we got our 
question papers.

2231
02:22:25,210 --> 02:22:27,190
We don't know what to 
give you in return!

2232
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:29,250
We don't have 
anything to give you!

2233
02:22:30,020 --> 02:22:31,510
Forget all the exams 
you've written.

2234
02:22:32,200 --> 02:22:33,510
You may pass or fail in them.

2235
02:22:34,580 --> 02:22:37,630
You guys, who are going to climb on to 
the 18th step, from this 17th step,

2236
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:38,900
should get prepared for...

2237
02:22:39,890 --> 02:22:42,860
the summer exam of 
your lives hereafter.

2238
02:22:43,710 --> 02:22:44,900
You shouldn't fail there.

2239
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:47,730
Forget about the social 
hierarchy in jobs that you do,

2240
02:22:48,410 --> 02:22:51,510
don't contaminate your lives by fighting 
for the colours of skins or flags,

2241
02:22:52,020 --> 02:22:55,630
and stay as the heartbeat of the 
people with you, for this land.

2242
02:22:55,790 --> 02:22:57,240
That's your responsibility.

2243
02:22:57,670 --> 02:22:58,920
Tomorrow is yours!

2244
02:22:59,210 --> 02:23:02,170
Every step that you take outside this room,

2245
02:23:02,520 --> 02:23:03,700
should have that realization.

2246
02:23:11,540 --> 02:23:15,150
Behind every achievement, 
there is that lesson I learned from ants.

2247
02:23:16,040 --> 02:23:18,400
The exam results also proved the same.

2248
02:23:19,390 --> 02:23:23,070
Based on that master plan 
devised by those 12 students,

2249
02:23:23,100 --> 02:23:26,780
a better plan was implemented 
in all 14 districts.

2250
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:29,160
And thus, the Government also 
became a part of our victory.

2251
02:23:37,340 --> 02:23:39,030
Rectifying all its problems,

2252
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:43,770
Mr. Moore, brought a first class 
school bus, to our school as well.

2253
02:23:52,950 --> 02:23:54,780
Today, when we're 
celebrating this success,

2254
02:23:55,090 --> 02:23:59,310
I remember my friends, who didn't 
fail in the exam called life.

2255
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,880
And those truthful words that 
made me open my eyes to the good.

2256
02:24:03,380 --> 02:24:05,010
Someone who's right to next us...

2257
02:24:05,320 --> 02:24:07,670
If we try to understand his dreams,

2258
02:24:08,020 --> 02:24:09,020
if we try really hard,

2259
02:24:09,430 --> 02:24:11,830
a whole new world would 
open up before us.

2260
02:24:12,760 --> 02:24:13,760
Today, my...

2261
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:25,380
I tried to understand...

2262
02:24:26,340 --> 02:24:27,340
... him!

2263
02:24:27,870 --> 02:24:29,300
Ajith Nair IAS.

2264
02:24:30,270 --> 02:24:31,270
My classmate.

2265
02:24:32,450 --> 02:24:34,930
To do what his conscience 
says is right, without fear,

2266
02:24:35,650 --> 02:24:39,280
the Nair at the end of his name, or his 
designation are no obstacles for him.

2267
02:24:39,350 --> 02:24:40,350
Brother!

2268
02:24:40,380 --> 02:24:41,380
I am not alone.

2269
02:24:42,260 --> 02:24:44,940
I've brought a gift for you.

2270
02:25:12,620 --> 02:25:13,620
Not just mine...

2271
02:25:14,250 --> 02:25:16,160
All our old friends' 
efforts were there,

2272
02:25:16,340 --> 02:25:18,340
behind finding Joy sir's 
own Annie Teacher.

2273
02:25:19,420 --> 02:25:21,600
And when I told her that 
we're coming to your school,

2274
02:25:21,970 --> 02:25:23,470
I didn't have to force her.

2275
02:25:25,620 --> 02:25:26,620
Thank you.

2276
02:25:28,290 --> 02:25:30,910
For bringing back Joy sir once again, 
through them.

2277
02:25:36,070 --> 02:25:37,070
Back then...

2278
02:25:37,570 --> 02:25:40,370
for Angel and Joy sir,

2279
02:25:41,470 --> 02:25:42,750
we did one more thing.

2280
02:25:46,140 --> 02:25:47,770
You needn't do anything for me.

2281
02:25:48,730 --> 02:25:50,090
If you wish to do something,

2282
02:25:51,010 --> 02:25:52,260
do it for her.

2283
02:25:53,340 --> 02:25:57,070
I want to see those who destroyed 
the light in her life.

2284
02:25:57,590 --> 02:25:58,590
Somewhere.

2285
02:25:58,780 --> 02:25:59,780
Just once.

2286
02:26:00,740 --> 02:26:04,760
They shouldn't repeat what they did to her, 
to anyone else.

2287
02:26:06,600 --> 02:26:08,040
Before going back,

2288
02:26:08,970 --> 02:26:12,650
I need to fulfill that 
duty as well, for Joy.

2289
02:27:34,320 --> 02:27:35,320
Sorry, friends.

2290
02:27:35,940 --> 02:27:37,940
I usually don't go to 
any party uninvited.

2291
02:27:38,550 --> 02:27:39,550
But I came here...

2292
02:27:39,650 --> 02:27:42,870
to take these two guys with me, 
without your permission.

2293
02:27:47,750 --> 02:27:48,750
Come on.

2294
02:27:48,970 --> 02:27:50,190
Your party is over.

2295
02:27:51,060 --> 02:27:52,540
You should confess to the world,

2296
02:27:52,540 --> 02:27:55,540
what happened to Angel and my 
Joy, who stood up for her.

2297
02:27:55,660 --> 02:27:56,660
Come on!

2298
02:27:59,160 --> 02:28:00,160
Who are you, Mister?

2299
02:28:01,480 --> 02:28:02,720
That's a long story, son.

2300
02:28:03,220 --> 02:28:05,780
If I start, I'll have to talk about 
a history of 30 years or so.

2301
02:28:06,870 --> 02:28:08,430
No one will take 
anyone away from here.

2302
02:28:09,820 --> 02:28:10,820
That's my brother.

2303
02:28:12,560 --> 02:28:15,940
Those who come to me wishing to learn, 
shouldn't be sent back empty handed.

2304
02:28:16,190 --> 02:28:18,010
That's what my teacher 
taught me in 3rd grade.

2305
02:28:18,590 --> 02:28:20,400
I shouldn't be correcting it myself, right?

2306
02:28:20,980 --> 02:28:21,980
Isn't that disrespectful?

2307
02:29:08,230 --> 02:29:09,230
Ayyappa!

2308
02:29:13,460 --> 02:29:17,180
What flowed through the wound 
that Ayyappan received for me,

2309
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:19,450
was his unconditional love for me.

2310
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:20,920
That was my greatest realization.

2311
02:29:23,420 --> 02:29:24,420
Don't close your eyes.

2312
02:29:24,910 --> 02:29:26,140
You have promised me.

2313
02:29:27,020 --> 02:29:28,020
Don't fail.

2314
02:29:28,380 --> 02:29:29,630
You gave me your word!

2315
02:29:29,930 --> 02:29:30,930
Don't fail.

2316
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:32,840
I need you.

2317
02:29:33,440 --> 02:29:34,440
Come on!

2318
02:29:36,740 --> 02:29:40,350
What gave us the strength to face any 
danger with extra boldness,

2319
02:29:40,850 --> 02:29:42,960
were those words that 
our teacher taught us.

2320
02:31:12,910 --> 02:31:15,780
They have minds that can 
dream beyond the sky!

2321
02:31:16,330 --> 02:31:21,960
The first batch among them is 
stepping out of these walls today.

2322
02:31:22,860 --> 02:31:23,860
Bless them.

2323
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:31,310
'One world, one sky... 
One song that the rain sings'

2324
02:31:31,410 --> 02:31:36,680
'Aren't you the one showering 
happiness without boundaries?'

2325
02:31:36,730 --> 02:31:41,990
'Many colours, many fragrances, 
many stars, many shores'

2326
02:31:42,020 --> 02:31:47,060
'I can sense you in all of them'

2327
02:31:47,100 --> 02:31:49,600
'Are you the voice or the light?'

2328
02:31:49,630 --> 02:31:52,290
'Are you the shore or the wave?'

2329
02:31:52,300 --> 02:31:55,070
'Are you a boon, 
or the mind?'

2330
02:31:55,090 --> 02:31:57,500
'Are you the solace?'

2331
02:31:57,630 --> 02:32:00,720
'Are you the voice or the light?'

2332
02:32:00,750 --> 02:32:03,050
'Are you the shore or the wave?'

2333
02:32:03,090 --> 02:32:05,720
'Are you a boon, 
or the mind?'

2334
02:32:05,780 --> 02:32:08,280
'Are you the solace?'

2335
02:32:08,300 --> 02:32:11,130
'Are you the voice or the light?'

2336
02:32:11,170 --> 02:32:13,800
'Are you the shore or the wave?'

2337
02:32:13,820 --> 02:32:16,450
'Are you a boon, 
or the mind?'

2338
02:32:16,480 --> 02:32:19,020
'Are you the solace?'

2339
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:22,000
'Are you the voice or the light?'

2340
02:32:22,030 --> 02:32:24,260
'Are you the shore or the wave?'

2341
02:32:24,290 --> 02:32:26,870
'Are you a boon, 
or the mind?'

2342
02:32:26,900 --> 02:32:29,520
'Are you the solace?'
