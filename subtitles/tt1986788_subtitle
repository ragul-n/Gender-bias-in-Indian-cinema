1
00:03:40,634 --> 00:03:42,158
There are girls among
all groups, friend.

2
00:03:42,235 --> 00:03:43,566
There is none in our group.

3
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,831
We will have to admit a girl
into our group soon.

4
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:48,304
She must be witty, charming
and brave.

5
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:50,567
She must be worth joining
our group. -Yes!

6
00:03:50,644 --> 00:03:52,339
We won't find any
girl like that.

7
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:54,403
We'll arrange something.
There'll be no arranging.

8
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:56,141
We'll have to get it done.

9
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:04,780
Students, for moving ahead
in life we need an aim.

10
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:07,457
Why is he telling
us this rubbish?

11
00:04:07,794 --> 00:04:09,284
It appears that someone
is listening to..

12
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:10,795
..his speech for the
first time in life.

13
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:13,622
The one who works hard will win.

14
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,167
Good line for a title.

15
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:17,827
If we give it to a movie company
we'll get some extra cash.

16
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:23,507
May I come in sir? -Yes.

17
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:28,108
New admission? -Yes sir.

18
00:04:28,348 --> 00:04:29,610
Please be seated.

19
00:04:33,353 --> 00:04:35,446
Someone tell him to
start the class.

20
00:04:35,755 --> 00:04:37,620
Sir, start the lecture.

21
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:39,788
I didn't know that..

22
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:42,418
..you people are very interested
in learning chemistry.

23
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:44,759
Chemistry is better
than your speech.

24
00:04:45,532 --> 00:04:48,660
Students, today we will
discuss electrons.

25
00:04:48,902 --> 00:04:51,632
An electron is a negatively
charged particle..

26
00:04:51,838 --> 00:04:54,272
..that revolves around the
nucleus of an atom.

27
00:04:54,374 --> 00:04:56,569
An electron's movement
is in waves.

28
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,441
An electron starts from a base
and returns to resume again.

29
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:05,283
It is called a standing wave.

30
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:10,647
When an electron crosses the
path of another it is..

31
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,485
It is called a sitting wave!

32
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:18,087
Don't try to act over-smart!
Sorry sir.

33
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:21,359
I have gone through the
phase that you are in.

34
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:23,429
Understand? -Yes sir.

35
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,730
Now sit down.

36
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:27,564
So students..

37
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:30,766
..chemistry is learnt
by studying..

38
00:05:31,678 --> 00:05:33,270
..and not by talking aloud.

39
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,575
This is the principal's
office. -Ok.

40
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:38,317
What are you doing here? Leave!

41
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:42,244
Where are you going? -I wish
to meet the principal.

42
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:44,414
You cannot meet him without
an appointment.

43
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:47,257
Look, I have been admitted
recently.

44
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:48,760
Let me meet the principal.

45
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:51,422
Whatever you may have to ask,
do it in the office.

46
00:05:51,498 --> 00:05:53,557
Come.. -Go away.
Come, lets go.

47
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:54,725
Wait!

48
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:59,705
Look, the principal
is like our father.

49
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,174
We can meet him whenever
we want to.

50
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:03,774
What right do you
have to stop us?

51
00:06:04,077 --> 00:06:05,669
Is that so? -Come..

52
00:06:05,812 --> 00:06:07,370
Get lost! -Come..

53
00:06:10,617 --> 00:06:14,144
We must tell Varun about
this. -Right.

54
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:16,316
Incredible.

55
00:06:16,823 --> 00:06:19,485
That girl wasn't scared
on seeing Bheem.

56
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:21,856
Plus she rebuked him as well.

57
00:06:22,562 --> 00:06:24,860
This girl must be in our gang.

58
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:29,257
That's fine but who will
talk to that girl?

59
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:30,861
I will.

60
00:06:31,705 --> 00:06:32,763
You?

61
00:06:34,407 --> 00:06:37,467
Not just talking, I'll shake
hands with her too. -It's a bet.

62
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:39,176
You'll lose.

63
00:06:39,345 --> 00:06:40,778
How much do you wager?

64
00:06:42,282 --> 00:06:43,544
200 rupees.

65
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:47,143
You'll lose. I wager 201 rupees.

66
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:50,379
Have it ready. He tells me..

67
00:06:58,765 --> 00:07:02,201
Excuse me. Can you lend
me your notes?

68
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:04,097
I'll return them
to you tomorrow.

69
00:07:04,237 --> 00:07:07,172
My mother scolds me if I lend
my notes to anyone. Sorry.

70
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,807
Hello. -Hi.

71
00:07:12,412 --> 00:07:13,709
It's my birthday.

72
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:16,342
Happy birthday. -Thank you.

73
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:17,778
Hi. Varun.

74
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:21,311
I'm Bharat.

75
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:23,211
We're leaving. -Come.

76
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:27,657
How much did you wager?

77
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:29,661
What? -Bet?

78
00:07:30,463 --> 00:07:31,794
How did you know?

79
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:35,496
I'm from Mumbai. I must
know that much.

80
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:37,467
What about my share?

81
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:39,797
The bet was of rupees 200..

82
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:42,507
There was something
here. -..and one.

83
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:45,676
What? -I mean, it was
worth 201 rupees.

84
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:48,538
Will 20 percent do?

85
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:51,780
No. 40 percent. Pay me tomorrow.

86
00:07:58,124 --> 00:07:59,113
Abhinav.

87
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:03,320
He'll bring out the money.

88
00:08:11,204 --> 00:08:13,729
Alright. -The wager was worth
201 rupees, right?

89
00:08:17,677 --> 00:08:20,202
Don't give money in
a sad mood. Kiddo!

90
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,080
She isn't a girl but pepper.

91
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:27,242
Whatever.. how did she know
that this is a bet?

92
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:29,819
GOK. -Meaning?

93
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:32,288
God only knows. -Ok.

94
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:37,526
Chutki. -Yes papa?

95
00:08:38,498 --> 00:08:40,659
Did you get your unit
tests' results?

96
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:42,257
Yes dad. We got it.

97
00:08:42,836 --> 00:08:46,294
You have got the first rank,
right dear? -No mother.

98
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:47,497
I'm fourth.

99
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:55,273
How many marks did the first
ranker score above yours?

100
00:08:55,548 --> 00:08:57,209
15 marks.

101
00:08:58,685 --> 00:09:01,381
Now multiply 15 by 10.

102
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:03,316
150.

103
00:09:04,157 --> 00:09:08,287
Right. Now do 150 sit-ups
while holding your ear.

104
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:09,586
Go on.

105
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:15,357
One, two..

106
00:09:16,469 --> 00:09:18,164
..three.. -She isn't
ashamed to admit it.

107
00:09:18,304 --> 00:09:19,566
If you would have studied
a little more..

108
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:21,173
..you could have got the
first rank, right?

109
00:09:21,341 --> 00:09:22,399
Five

110
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:25,301
..six.. -How does that matter?

111
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:29,472
You always do that but
this girl doesn't improve.

112
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:31,580
She'll never improve.

113
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:34,450
Don't worry. She'll not
get food today either.

114
00:09:34,654 --> 00:09:35,712
What is this, mother?

115
00:09:35,822 --> 00:09:38,313
For such a small mistake, you
punish her so harshly.

116
00:09:38,758 --> 00:09:40,692
Plus, you don't give
her food too!

117
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:45,592
Have you forgotten? We
did that with you too.

118
00:09:45,698 --> 00:09:48,531
Son, that is the reason why you
have the first rank in class.

119
00:09:49,202 --> 00:09:50,362
This is intolerable.

120
00:09:50,436 --> 00:09:52,870
When did you learn to argue
with your mother?

121
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:56,473
Go inside and study.

122
00:09:56,743 --> 00:09:59,576
69, 70..

123
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,472
..71..

124
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:03,540
..72.

125
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:08,746
Mother, it hurts a lot. May
I stop? -Absolutely not.

126
00:10:09,322 --> 00:10:12,348
If you stop you'll have to
start all over again.

127
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:15,151
Continue it. -73

128
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:17,254
7 4..

129
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:19,391
..75..

130
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:23,233
148..

131
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:25,898
..149..

132
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:29,400
..150.

133
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:34,511
Mother, I finished it.

134
00:10:35,648 --> 00:10:37,377
May I go to brother?

135
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:45,749
Brother, I'm hurt.

136
00:10:47,327 --> 00:10:48,726
It will be alright sister.

137
00:10:49,796 --> 00:10:53,630
Brother, did mother punish
you in the same way?

138
00:10:56,402 --> 00:10:57,460
Didn't you cry?

139
00:11:00,106 --> 00:11:03,098
I.. I wont cry either..

140
00:11:03,443 --> 00:11:06,105
..but it hurts a lot, brother.

141
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,843
What did you do when
you were hungry?

142
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:29,490
Brother, I feel hungry.
I still won't cry.

143
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,768
I'll return soon.

144
00:11:39,312 --> 00:11:41,644
If Chutki keeps getting
low marks..

145
00:11:41,781 --> 00:11:43,373
Where are you going now?

146
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,143
I'm going to Varun's house.
I wanted some books.

147
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:56,794
Hi. -Hi.

148
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,389
What happened? You appear
to be worried.

149
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:02,101
You know about my parents.

150
00:12:02,301 --> 00:12:04,292
They didn't give Chutki
food today.

151
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:06,634
I'm out of pocket money too.

152
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,872
I thought if you could
lend me 50 rupees..

153
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:11,575
I'll return it as soon
as I get my allowance.

154
00:12:11,644 --> 00:12:14,112
Do you want me to hit you? Isn't
Chutki like my sister too?

155
00:12:14,547 --> 00:12:17,516
Ok, come inside. -No, friend.
I'm comfortable here.

156
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:19,877
Alright then.

157
00:12:23,222 --> 00:12:24,314
Take this.

158
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:26,653
50 would be enough.

159
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:28,883
Keep it. You may need it.

160
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:31,223
Listen. A book?

161
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:39,134
Take this.

162
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:41,233
Thanks. -Bye. -Bye.

163
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:47,337
That's enough.

164
00:12:49,415 --> 00:12:51,280
What happened? Did
you get the book?

165
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:53,510
Yes. -Come and have dinner.

166
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:55,780
No. I have to do homework.
You may have dinner.

167
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:57,219
I'll eat it later.

168
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:13,697
Take this.

169
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:25,216
Excuse me, Vaishnavi.

170
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:28,181
40 percent makes it 80 rupees.

171
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:30,548
Thank you. -There
are no lectures.

172
00:13:31,157 --> 00:13:33,625
Why? -The physics lecturer
is on a leave.

173
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,626
Oh! -If you don't mind, will
you come to the canteen?

174
00:13:38,131 --> 00:13:41,191
Actually, many students from
my class are sitting there.

175
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:43,699
Still, you were waiting
for me here.

176
00:13:44,437 --> 00:13:46,268
That too for giving me money?

177
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:49,232
I wanted to be friends
through that.

178
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:51,376
I like your frankness.

179
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:54,436
Have you joined any private
coaching class?

180
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:56,375
Yes. Krishna Coaching.

181
00:13:56,516 --> 00:13:58,381
Splendid. I study there too.

182
00:13:58,584 --> 00:14:00,381
I didn't see you come
there anytime.

183
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,084
I joined today. -Oh.

184
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,815
I feel very hungry.
Have patience.

185
00:14:07,093 --> 00:14:08,253
You're a greedy boy.
Try to understand.

186
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:10,352
You explain. -Don't
think so much.

187
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,757
Leave that.. -Did you order
something or not?

188
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:15,828
We have ordered samosas.
There, we have it.

189
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:23,332
Take this. -Thank you.

190
00:14:29,115 --> 00:14:32,175
It's very hot. -Refrigerate
it to cool it.

191
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:35,652
Really nice. -You didn't
ask us our names.

192
00:14:36,155 --> 00:14:37,747
Let us introduce ourselves.

193
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:41,593
I'm Salman Khan. You can call
me Sallu as a nickname.

194
00:14:41,727 --> 00:14:43,854
What? -I'm Salman Khan
from Allahabad.

195
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:45,762
Is your real name 'Prem'?

196
00:14:45,898 --> 00:14:48,128
My parents named me
Dhiraj by mistake.

197
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:51,167
Don't worry. Patience  
is necessary in love  .

198
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:55,163
Hi, I'm Gaurav. -I'm Nitin.

199
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:57,566
You already know me.
I met you yesterday.

200
00:14:57,643 --> 00:14:59,235
You are Bharat, right? -Yeah.

201
00:15:00,713 --> 00:15:03,079
I'm Navneet. -I'm Abhinav.

202
00:15:03,282 --> 00:15:04,681
I'm the one who lost the
bet yesterday. -Oh.

203
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,218
Don't worry. I'll pay
the canteen bill.

204
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,615
Waiter, get ice-cream
for everyone too.

205
00:15:09,722 --> 00:15:12,486
If the bill is on someone else,
we can even drink phenol.

206
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:16,760
Stop all this. -How did
you like our city?

207
00:15:17,163 --> 00:15:19,222
I haven't gone around
Allahabad yet.

208
00:15:19,398 --> 00:15:21,263
Come on. We'll show you around.

209
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:50,157
This city is great fun.

210
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:52,622
This is a city of guava.

211
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,396
It is the city of Allahabad.

212
00:15:57,169 --> 00:15:59,364
This city is great fun.

213
00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:01,766
This is a city of guava.

214
00:16:02,308 --> 00:16:05,334
It is the city of Allahabad.

215
00:16:05,444 --> 00:16:09,813
APoet Harivansh used
to stay here.

216
00:16:10,616 --> 00:16:15,246
His lines are unique
and beautiful.

217
00:16:15,421 --> 00:16:17,787
This city touches the Ganges..

218
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,354
It also touches Yamuna.

219
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:24,586
Goddess Saraswati comes
here for a dance.

220
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:39,304
Hey!

221
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:00,461
Amitabh belongs
to this place..

222
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,225
..so do spicy snacks.

223
00:17:03,636 --> 00:17:07,834
Also, pens, envelopes
and books.

224
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:11,303
There are many jokes
going around here.

225
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:13,635
Seriousness is still present.

226
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:18,716
That is the enjoyable
part of unity here.

227
00:17:19,118 --> 00:17:23,782
That is Alfred Park..
It is so pure..

228
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,522
This is where Azad died
while fighting.

229
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:34,559
This is Allahabad. It
is incomparable.

230
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,160
This is a crown among cities.

231
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:42,532
This city is great fun.

232
00:17:43,175 --> 00:17:45,234
This is a city of guava.

233
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:48,875
It is the city of Allahabad.

234
00:17:49,582 --> 00:17:51,709
This city is great fun.

235
00:17:52,318 --> 00:17:54,445
This is a city of guava.

236
00:17:54,787 --> 00:17:58,120
It is the city of Allahabad.

237
00:18:19,211 --> 00:18:24,308
Some people sing at the
merging of rivers.

238
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:29,318
Look, there is Anand
Bhavan ahead of you.

239
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:34,682
Whether it is Pandit Nehru
or Lal Bahadur Shastri..

240
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:39,758
India's kings have
been born here.

241
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:42,633
It is a meeting place
for lovers.

242
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:45,362
It is a respectful place
for the Goddess.

243
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:50,532
Netaram's crossroad.. -It
is still well known here.

244
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:55,669
It is unique and fast-paced
but it moves calmly.

245
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:58,316
It isn't expensive
or spend-thrift.

246
00:18:58,451 --> 00:19:00,817
It is a little different city.

247
00:19:01,554 --> 00:19:03,749
This city is great fun.

248
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:06,383
This is a city of guava.

249
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:10,251
It is the city of Allahabad.

250
00:19:10,663 --> 00:19:12,756
This city is great fun.

251
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:15,765
This is a city of guava.

252
00:19:16,101 --> 00:19:19,161
It is the city of Allahabad.

253
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:23,635
Poet Harivansh.. -..used
to stay here.

254
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:29,074
His lines are unique..
..and beautiful.

255
00:19:29,248 --> 00:19:31,375
This city touches the Ganges..

256
00:19:31,717 --> 00:19:34,208
It also touches Yamuna.

257
00:19:34,353 --> 00:19:38,585
Goddess Saraswati comes
here for a dance.

258
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:51,160
Have some tea. -Finally you're
here, though by chance.

259
00:19:52,104 --> 00:19:53,264
How do I explain, Ketan?

260
00:19:53,372 --> 00:19:55,670
I'm so worried about
children's studies.

261
00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:57,301
That is right.

262
00:19:57,476 --> 00:20:00,274
There is nothing other than
studying in life these days.

263
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:01,674
SYes. -You are absolutely
right.

264
00:20:01,814 --> 00:20:03,839
Dhiraj, come here. -Yes.

265
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:09,718
Mahesh, this is my son Dhiraj.

266
00:20:10,422 --> 00:20:11,616
Greetings uncle, greetings aunt.

267
00:20:11,724 --> 00:20:13,316
Greetings. -Greetings.

268
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:14,858
What grade are you in, dear?

269
00:20:15,194 --> 00:20:17,253
Junior Inter. -Science or arts?

270
00:20:17,396 --> 00:20:18,522
Science.

271
00:20:18,697 --> 00:20:21,757
Child, are you preparing for
medical or llT's entrance exams?

272
00:20:23,235 --> 00:20:25,135
llT. -llT?

273
00:20:25,437 --> 00:20:27,905
My son Rohit is preparing
for llT as well.

274
00:20:28,374 --> 00:20:30,638
He keeps on studying all day!

275
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:32,368
Doesn't he eat or sleep?

276
00:20:33,846 --> 00:20:38,681
She means that he studies along
with other activities.

277
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:42,209
No friends, no films,
no television..

278
00:20:42,288 --> 00:20:43,755
There is no enjoyment,
just studying.

279
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:45,254
Good boy. Good boy.

280
00:20:45,824 --> 00:20:48,156
Uncle, I have homework
to be done.

281
00:20:48,494 --> 00:20:49,586
Excuse me.

282
00:20:53,232 --> 00:20:55,200
He's nice. -Have tea.

283
00:20:55,734 --> 00:20:57,497
Dhiraj. Dhiraj.

284
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,767
This isn't the way to talk.

285
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:01,169
Do you talk to elders
in this fashion?

286
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:02,570
You have become very spoilt.

287
00:21:02,775 --> 00:21:04,140
Look at Rohit.

288
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,740
Mrs. Malvani was saying
it with pride..

289
00:21:07,212 --> 00:21:09,203
..that her son studies all day.

290
00:21:09,882 --> 00:21:11,577
I was bitterly ashamed!

291
00:21:12,651 --> 00:21:15,211
Mother, that is nothing
to be ashamed about.

292
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:20,782
Dhiraj, Rohit has got 95 percent
marks in 10th grade.

293
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:23,852
You have got only 86
percent. Get that?

294
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,895
Mother, why are you embarrassed?

295
00:21:26,231 --> 00:21:28,426
Is it because I got 86 percent..

296
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,491
..or is it because l
don't study all day?

297
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:32,136
Both, you insolent boy!

298
00:21:32,237 --> 00:21:34,728
Dad, I'm not like your
car or mummy's TV.

299
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,365
You call it the latest model
and show-off to people.

300
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:39,340
Insolent brat! You
talk too much!

301
00:21:39,678 --> 00:21:41,669
This boy will have
us dishonoured.

302
00:21:52,358 --> 00:21:54,656
Good morning, sir.

303
00:21:56,161 --> 00:22:01,531
If you people talk in Hindi,
I'll be very happy.

304
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:05,234
Good morning. -Good
morning, sir.

305
00:22:05,337 --> 00:22:06,599
Very good.

306
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:12,574
Where were we, kids? -
In the classroom, sir.

307
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,413
You people are over-smart.

308
00:22:22,588 --> 00:22:25,318
What I meant was..

309
00:22:25,457 --> 00:22:28,790
..how much did I teach during
the last lecture?

310
00:22:29,228 --> 00:22:31,321
Child Sona, tell me.

311
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:35,627
Sir, she isn't a boy but a girl.

312
00:22:42,274 --> 00:22:45,141
A dog only knows how to bark.

313
00:22:45,344 --> 00:22:47,744
Don't pay attention here.
Come on, tell us.

314
00:22:51,216 --> 00:22:54,515
Sir, when Dushyant
meets Shakuntala..

315
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,282
Beautiful! Splendid!

316
00:22:57,756 --> 00:22:59,485
Sit. Sit down.

317
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:02,385
What is it? Abhinav, what is it?

318
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:05,357
Why are you looking outside
the door for?

319
00:23:05,497 --> 00:23:06,691
Nothing, sir.

320
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:09,096
I'm asking you something.

321
00:23:09,168 --> 00:23:10,692
Tell me the truth.

322
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:14,169
There is nothing special, sir.
You dare to use such words?

323
00:23:14,373 --> 00:23:16,238
I'll have you beaten up.

324
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:20,370
Sir, if you leave the class I'll
meet Shakuntala. -Quiet!

325
00:23:21,413 --> 00:23:23,313
Sit down. -Thank you sir.

326
00:23:32,357 --> 00:23:35,224
Not every gag is humorous.

327
00:23:35,694 --> 00:23:37,628
You look so funny.

328
00:23:40,466 --> 00:23:42,559
Concentrate on studying.

329
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:49,164
Dushyant saw Shakuntala
and was stunned.

330
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:54,244
He said, 'from where has
this beauty come?'

331
00:23:55,314 --> 00:23:58,340
It appears as though some
Goddess forgot her way..

332
00:23:58,517 --> 00:24:01,315
..and came down to earth
from the skies.

333
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,688
Oh God! -What happened?

334
00:24:03,822 --> 00:24:06,723
Sir, it was a queer noise.
Sona, the bug is near you!

335
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:08,157
A bug! -Where is it?

336
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,784
Sir, Abhinav said
that a bug is..

337
00:24:10,095 --> 00:24:11,653
Where is the bug? -A bug!

338
00:24:12,097 --> 00:24:13,394
A bug! -Yes sir.

339
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:16,567
I'm coming there. Where is it?
Its somewhere closeby.

340
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:18,260
Where? -Here it is sir.

341
00:24:21,273 --> 00:24:22,501
Quiet!

342
00:24:23,242 --> 00:24:26,643
I think it has left
through the door.

343
00:24:26,745 --> 00:24:28,713
Come on, lets study.

344
00:24:32,217 --> 00:24:33,411
We had a lot of fun.
Yes friend.

345
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:35,112
We have hurt our stomach
while laughing.

346
00:24:35,187 --> 00:24:37,849
Wait Abhinav. -I'm
leaving. Bye!

347
00:24:38,757 --> 00:24:41,317
What is it? Why do
you need me today?

348
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,894
What was the bug-episode
about? -Bug episode?

349
00:24:44,396 --> 00:24:46,694
The bug came and went. I don't
know anything else.

350
00:24:46,832 --> 00:24:49,426
Listen, I'm not Sona.
I know everything.

351
00:24:49,735 --> 00:24:51,430
You must have done
some mischief.

352
00:24:51,537 --> 00:24:53,562
You turned out to be smarter
than me. -What?

353
00:24:53,672 --> 00:24:55,833
I should say that you are
cleverer than me but..

354
00:24:57,676 --> 00:25:00,144
That's alright but tell
me what you did.

355
00:25:00,546 --> 00:25:02,411
There is a condition.
What is that?

356
00:25:02,514 --> 00:25:04,379
You will have to join our gang.

357
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,377
Are you ordering me
or requesting?

358
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:10,087
You may assume anything but
that is the condition.

359
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,080
Alright. Tell me now.

360
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,100
Meet the new gang member.

361
00:25:24,436 --> 00:25:26,768
Welcome to our gang.
Thank you.

362
00:25:27,606 --> 00:25:29,437
What's your name? - My name?

363
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:33,108
Not yours. I asked for
the gang's name.

364
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,112
Dashing Lads.

365
00:25:35,514 --> 00:25:38,540
I don't see any girl
in this gang.

366
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,810
There is no girl in the
gang. -Why me then?

367
00:25:42,387 --> 00:25:46,414
Actually, until today we didn't
find a dashing girl till today.

368
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:49,187
Why do you think I am
dashing then?

369
00:25:50,295 --> 00:25:52,160
From an obtuse angle,
you do look dashing.

370
00:25:53,165 --> 00:25:55,690
You argued with Bhim,
that is why.

371
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:59,231
Varun, look at this.
What is it?

372
00:26:01,373 --> 00:26:03,705
A student from llT
doing his Phd.

373
00:26:04,543 --> 00:26:06,067
It's his news.

374
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,577
That boy from Kanpur?

375
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:12,508
Yes.

376
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:15,553
He didn't like to
study in Mumbai.

377
00:26:15,754 --> 00:26:19,713
He told his father about this
but he didn't agree.

378
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:22,159
He must be authoritarian
like your father.

379
00:26:22,294 --> 00:26:24,455
Is his father authoritarian?
Tell her.

380
00:26:24,663 --> 00:26:26,187
Tell her about your dad.

381
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:33,336
Be quiet. -Why?
Look at the TV.

382
00:26:36,608 --> 00:26:38,576
Did you get the Inter
application forms?

383
00:26:38,844 --> 00:26:40,744
Yes papa. I'll get it. -Ok.

384
00:26:41,713 --> 00:26:42,839
Take this.

385
00:26:44,883 --> 00:26:47,408
Son, did you do your
homework? -Yes dad.

386
00:26:48,186 --> 00:26:49,676
You watch a lot of TV.

387
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,233
I told you to apply for science.
Why did you write arts?

388
00:27:09,241 --> 00:27:11,402
Dumb students take arts.

389
00:27:12,778 --> 00:27:15,474
But papa, I like literature.

390
00:27:15,747 --> 00:27:18,511
What does literature have other
than stories and fables?

391
00:27:19,217 --> 00:27:20,616
Come out of the world
of imagination..

392
00:27:20,686 --> 00:27:22,551
..and come into the
world of reality.

393
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:25,246
I know what is right and
what is wrong for you.

394
00:27:28,126 --> 00:27:30,390
At least listen to
what he is saying.

395
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:31,621
Be quiet!

396
00:27:32,698 --> 00:27:34,359
How would you know anything?

397
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:37,591
I told mother not to get me
married to a village girl.

398
00:27:37,703 --> 00:27:39,432
She said that you are a
beautiful and cultured girl..

399
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:40,765
..and had me tied with you.

400
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:45,333
What does all this have to do
with Navneet's education?

401
00:27:46,645 --> 00:27:49,136
You will study science.
That is final!

402
00:28:04,463 --> 00:28:05,691
Some parents think..

403
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:08,561
..that they are doing good
for their children.

404
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,667
That is the reason why they
force the children.

405
00:28:12,771 --> 00:28:14,739
The children that cannot bear..

406
00:28:15,674 --> 00:28:17,539
..being forced commit suicide.

407
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:20,840
When a bride commits suicide..

408
00:28:21,413 --> 00:28:24,610
..the culprits are deemed to be
the in-laws or her husband.

409
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,445
But when this problem
comes before kids..

410
00:28:27,686 --> 00:28:30,154
..why aren't their
parents blamed?

411
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:32,084
Why aren't they arrested?

412
00:28:32,224 --> 00:28:34,283
Yes, friend. This is right.

413
00:28:35,293 --> 00:28:37,352
But what can we do as children?

414
00:28:38,697 --> 00:28:41,222
Forget that. Its time
for classes.

415
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:42,560
Let's go. Come on. -Yes.

416
00:28:42,634 --> 00:28:44,158
Yes, let's go. -Come.

417
00:28:49,474 --> 00:28:51,169
Hi mother! Hi father! -Hi.

418
00:28:51,376 --> 00:28:52,536
Vaishnavi, the food is
served on the table.

419
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:54,101
Have it. -No mother. l
don't have time now.

420
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:55,373
I'll have it later.

421
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:01,608
Mechanics! Where have
I kept the book?

422
00:29:04,189 --> 00:29:05,281
Mummy!

423
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:09,618
I'll search for it.
Eat your meal.

424
00:29:11,463 --> 00:29:12,521
Mummy!

425
00:29:13,331 --> 00:29:14,389
Mother!

426
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:19,737
Mother! Come quickly.
Be careful.

427
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:23,069
Sit and eat. -I'm getting late.

428
00:29:23,108 --> 00:29:24,803
At least sit and eat.
Keep this inside.

429
00:29:25,077 --> 00:29:26,669
What.. -I'll eat it later. Bye!

430
00:29:28,647 --> 00:29:30,672
She doesn't even have
time to eat food.

431
00:29:31,716 --> 00:29:33,547
It's not just our daughter.

432
00:29:34,386 --> 00:29:36,581
This is happening with
many kids today.

433
00:29:47,432 --> 00:29:49,423
Now find the average
velocity please.

434
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:56,266
Come on. Start doing it.

435
00:30:11,189 --> 00:30:12,315
What is this?

436
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:16,118
How can you do that?

437
00:30:16,895 --> 00:30:19,125
If you cant understand
such small detail..

438
00:30:19,598 --> 00:30:21,293
..you are entirely
unfit for science.

439
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:22,558
Look at this.

440
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:25,327
Look!

441
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:30,233
Do it like this. Sit
and do it again.

442
00:30:46,658 --> 00:30:49,252
Hello Mr. Dhiraj. Did you
write the problem?

443
00:30:49,794 --> 00:30:52,319
Yes sir. -Did you solve it too?

444
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:54,228
No.

445
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:56,225
Why not?

446
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,531
The question is very simple.

447
00:30:58,737 --> 00:31:01,137
It is interesting too. -No sir.

448
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:04,265
Its boring.

449
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,368
Oh!

450
00:31:07,112 --> 00:31:11,640
Kids, mechanics is..
Interesting!

451
00:31:12,317 --> 00:31:16,481
Sorry sir. Mechanics is boring!

452
00:31:18,657 --> 00:31:20,682
You better sleep.

453
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:30,294
Don't laugh you guys!
Go home and sleep.

454
00:31:30,402 --> 00:31:33,803
Wait a minute! You should
go home and study, right?

455
00:31:34,673 --> 00:31:37,335
This rascal Varun
laid this wager.

456
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:38,769
'Go and watch a movie at night.'

457
00:31:38,843 --> 00:31:40,208
'Then come and tell
me the story!'

458
00:31:40,412 --> 00:31:42,744
I admit it. You win and I lose.

459
00:31:42,847 --> 00:31:44,644
Enough? -Just admitting
your defeat won't do.

460
00:31:44,749 --> 00:31:47,149
Pay him the wager
money. -Alright.

461
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:48,447
I'll pay.

462
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:50,410
Take this. Enough?

463
00:31:51,323 --> 00:31:52,381
Come!

464
00:31:53,158 --> 00:31:56,252
So Dhiraj, did you leave your
house like a owner..

465
00:31:56,361 --> 00:31:57,760
..or more like a thief?

466
00:31:59,197 --> 00:32:00,289
What do you think?

467
00:32:00,365 --> 00:32:02,526
It doesn't need to be
considered. It's simple.

468
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:03,862
He isn't allowed to watch
a matinee show..

469
00:32:04,102 --> 00:32:05,569
..forget about a night show.

470
00:32:06,438 --> 00:32:08,099
How was the experience?

471
00:32:08,273 --> 00:32:12,437
Climbing the pipe
was really tough!

472
00:32:13,645 --> 00:32:16,580
Will you people walk quickly.
I'm getting late. -Why?

473
00:32:17,148 --> 00:32:18,615
Mother has called me
home early today.

474
00:32:18,717 --> 00:32:20,150
I have to go shopping.

475
00:32:20,218 --> 00:32:22,118
Oh yes! My birthday party
is on Saturday.

476
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:23,448
All of you have to come.

477
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:27,116
The party won't be bright
without us. -I admit that.

478
00:32:27,325 --> 00:32:29,759
It is the reason why I am not
lighting-up the party.

479
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:31,123
Bye!

480
00:32:34,132 --> 00:32:35,622
How are you, young doctor?

481
00:32:36,368 --> 00:32:39,599
I'm alright. -Mr. Bharat, the
doctor has called for you.

482
00:32:40,272 --> 00:32:41,330
Come on then.

483
00:32:44,209 --> 00:32:47,872
Is that young boy a doctor? -
No. He is the doctor's son.

484
00:32:48,146 --> 00:32:49,704
He is going to be a doctor.

485
00:32:50,215 --> 00:32:53,309
Does that imply that even
his son will be a doctor?

486
00:32:53,418 --> 00:32:55,443
Yes. A doctor's son
will be a doctor.

487
00:32:59,524 --> 00:33:01,219
Happy birthday! -Thank you!

488
00:33:06,765 --> 00:33:10,098
Happy birthday to
you! -Thank you!

489
00:33:10,335 --> 00:33:11,529
They are all my friends.

490
00:33:11,603 --> 00:33:14,595
Varun, Navneet, Abhinav,
Nitin, Gaurav, Bharat..

491
00:33:14,773 --> 00:33:16,741
..and that is Dhiraj.
Hello, hello! -Hi.

492
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:20,311
This is my uncle's friend. l
fondly call him young uncle.

493
00:33:20,545 --> 00:33:23,412
He is the most famous lawyer
in the city. Mr. Sanjay.

494
00:33:23,748 --> 00:33:25,648
You are a famous lawyer
of the city..

495
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,548
..who recently won a exciting
case in the city?

496
00:33:29,521 --> 00:33:31,386
The one with the fake
police encounter?

497
00:33:31,456 --> 00:33:33,356
You won an impossible case.

498
00:33:33,525 --> 00:33:35,186
Really glad to meet you
sir. -Thank you!

499
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,285
We read a lot about
you in newspapers.

500
00:33:37,362 --> 00:33:38,693
We're very happy to meet
you today, sir.

501
00:33:38,763 --> 00:33:40,390
Will you keep talking
like old men or..

502
00:33:40,498 --> 00:33:42,864
..will you dance
like young kids?

503
00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:45,236
Sir, you are insulting us.

504
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:48,601
No, sir. I am not insulting
you. I'm challenging you.

505
00:33:48,773 --> 00:33:50,434
Sir, you are challenging us?

506
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,806
Yes, it's a challenge.
Beat me to win.

507
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,314
O world!

508
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:08,551
I salute you.

509
00:34:09,094 --> 00:34:13,497
You forgot about my name.

510
00:34:16,267 --> 00:34:18,360
O world!

511
00:34:19,771 --> 00:34:23,229
I salute you.

512
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:28,174
You forgot about my name.

513
00:34:30,615 --> 00:34:37,282
Even though it was
by mistake, you..

514
00:34:37,789 --> 00:34:41,657
..remembered me.
Thanks for that.

515
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:46,197
Thank you! Yeah.

516
00:34:46,464 --> 00:34:48,864
Thank you!

517
00:34:51,136 --> 00:34:54,469
Sir, this is cheating. You
danced on a movie song.

518
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:57,606
We will sing and dance
at the same time.

519
00:34:57,742 --> 00:34:59,767
No. We'll cut the cake first.

520
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:17,421
You are like red pepper.

521
00:35:18,163 --> 00:35:21,758
You are hot and tangy fun.

522
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:26,293
Tell us something.

523
00:35:27,238 --> 00:35:30,730
How did you get this style?

524
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:35,202
You live on bribery.

525
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,348
You are like red pepper.

526
00:35:39,751 --> 00:35:44,120
You are hot and tangy fun.

527
00:36:05,844 --> 00:36:09,575
You say that you are a hero
but that isn't enough.

528
00:36:10,215 --> 00:36:14,413
You are as bad as Shah Rukh
and Aamir are good.

529
00:36:14,552 --> 00:36:18,420
You don't look at girls.
You are saint.

530
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:23,322
You eat as if it is
your last meal.

531
00:36:23,661 --> 00:36:27,461
You are just weeping
over yourself.

532
00:36:28,132 --> 00:36:31,533
What are you being
so sage-like?

533
00:36:32,103 --> 00:36:35,800
One, two, three.
Four, five, six.

534
00:36:36,107 --> 00:36:39,474
Seven, eight, nine and
ten! It's enough!

535
00:36:39,611 --> 00:36:44,310
Ok, you are a genuine
girl and we are fake.

536
00:36:45,149 --> 00:36:48,676
You are a grown up
and we are kids.

537
00:36:49,754 --> 00:36:53,485
Tell us something.

538
00:36:54,225 --> 00:36:57,854
How did you get this style?

539
00:36:58,196 --> 00:37:02,132
You live on bribery.

540
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:25,783
I'll appear great if you greet
me from a distance.

541
00:37:26,357 --> 00:37:30,453
If you annoy me, I'm
like red pepper.

542
00:37:30,628 --> 00:37:34,496
I'm pretty good if you
are friends with me.

543
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:39,297
I'm like Queen Jhansi
if you fight me.

544
00:37:39,737 --> 00:37:43,537
Now tell me what you
aspire to do.

545
00:37:44,175 --> 00:37:47,838
Will you fight me or do you
promise to be friends?

546
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:51,637
One, two, three.
Four, five, six.

547
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:55,551
Seven, eight, nine and
ten! It's enough!

548
00:37:55,687 --> 00:38:00,624
Enough! You are a fun
girl. You are great.

549
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:05,084
You are just an example
of mischief.

550
00:38:05,763 --> 00:38:09,529
Live like in such a way..

551
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:13,762
You listen to everyone
but do what you want.

552
00:38:14,072 --> 00:38:18,202
I wish you a happy birthday,
red pepper.

553
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:22,275
You are like red pepper.

554
00:38:22,747 --> 00:38:26,615
You are hot and tangy fun.

555
00:38:39,597 --> 00:38:40,723
Nice one.

556
00:38:43,434 --> 00:38:45,095
Very nice! Very nice!

557
00:39:02,487 --> 00:39:04,580
I have told you numerous times
to stop this painting..

558
00:39:04,656 --> 00:39:06,180
..and concentrate on studying!

559
00:39:07,191 --> 00:39:09,250
He has finished his homework.

560
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,590
Just because he has completed
his homework it doesn't mean..

561
00:39:11,696 --> 00:39:13,459
..that his studying is over too.

562
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:17,232
He must know all the subjects
in his syllabus very well.

563
00:39:18,302 --> 00:39:20,770
Only then will he get admission
in a good engineering college.

564
00:39:21,072 --> 00:39:22,232
Then he'll be able to get a job.

565
00:39:22,373 --> 00:39:24,705
What are you staring at?!
Go on and study!

566
00:39:26,444 --> 00:39:28,071
He always keeps on painting.

567
00:40:04,482 --> 00:40:05,574
I know..

568
00:40:07,251 --> 00:40:08,741
..how much you love Gaurav.

569
00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:12,881
But..

570
00:40:13,825 --> 00:40:17,761
..you show more anger than love.

571
00:40:20,765 --> 00:40:24,223
If he isn't disciplined he'll quit
studying and go on painting.

572
00:40:25,169 --> 00:40:29,367
But you know how much he
is fond of painting.

573
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,335
Yes but what do you
gain from all that?

574
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:37,147
What do you mean? l
don't understand.

575
00:40:38,483 --> 00:40:39,575
Janki..

576
00:40:40,418 --> 00:40:43,649
..all this painting, writing,
dance and theatre..

577
00:40:44,789 --> 00:40:46,484
It gives us nothing.

578
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:49,352
One in many becomes great.

579
00:40:50,228 --> 00:40:53,254
The others wander in search
of a livelihood.

580
00:40:56,567 --> 00:40:58,262
We have to make him
an engineer or..

581
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:00,803
..doctor or an officer of lAS.

582
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,172
I am just waiting for
that day when he..

583
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:08,144
..will get off an
official's car.

584
00:41:09,814 --> 00:41:11,748
I will be proud to see that.

585
00:41:25,129 --> 00:41:27,620
So, Vaishnavi. How's the
experiment going?

586
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:29,758
Ok, sir.

587
00:41:31,569 --> 00:41:32,627
Now.

588
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:42,170
Navneet, what are you doing?

589
00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:46,273
Come on, concentrate.

590
00:41:47,485 --> 00:41:49,851
First you find the length
of a simple pendulum.

591
00:41:50,188 --> 00:41:51,712
Here. Alright?

592
00:41:52,657 --> 00:41:56,149
You find the diameter with the
help of vernear calibus.

593
00:41:56,727 --> 00:41:57,785
Ok?

594
00:41:58,596 --> 00:42:01,326
It's like this. Got it?

595
00:42:03,234 --> 00:42:04,667
Then you find the radius.

596
00:42:05,436 --> 00:42:07,427
You do know what a
radius is, right?

597
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,132
Come on, Navneet.

598
00:42:12,243 --> 00:42:14,711
Come and meet me in the staff
room. -Sir, a notice.

599
00:42:18,316 --> 00:42:19,783
Ok, boys and girls.

600
00:42:20,885 --> 00:42:23,149
Arun, Promod, Abhinav,
Vinay, Ritika.

601
00:42:23,454 --> 00:42:25,854
Go and meet an administrative
officer in the office.

602
00:42:30,261 --> 00:42:32,354
You have mid-term exams starting
from the third.

603
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:34,896
The time-table is on the notice
board. Please check it.

604
00:42:35,766 --> 00:42:37,233
Now you can continue.

605
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:43,366
I was talking in the
classroom yesterday.

606
00:42:43,474 --> 00:42:45,499
Maybe due to that..
Yes, friend.

607
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:47,601
It could be something else too.

608
00:42:47,712 --> 00:42:49,771
How can that be? -It
could be anything.

609
00:42:51,816 --> 00:42:53,147
There he comes. -He came.

610
00:42:53,217 --> 00:42:55,583
Why had you been
called in the office?

611
00:42:55,853 --> 00:42:57,150
It was nothing.

612
00:42:57,221 --> 00:42:59,155
It was about exemption for
the reservation category.

613
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:00,418
What does that mean?

614
00:43:00,658 --> 00:43:02,751
I'm a student in the reservation
category.

615
00:43:03,094 --> 00:43:05,085
That is why I get a
rebate in the fees.

616
00:43:05,763 --> 00:43:08,129
Even my seat is in the
reservation category.

617
00:43:08,332 --> 00:43:10,527
That means competition
is even lesser.

618
00:43:10,668 --> 00:43:13,102
That's great, friend.
Congratulations!

619
00:43:13,571 --> 00:43:15,436
Thanks but no thanks.

620
00:43:16,507 --> 00:43:18,566
I refused to accept
it. -Why? -Why?

621
00:43:19,343 --> 00:43:20,867
We have enough money.

622
00:43:21,712 --> 00:43:23,839
I don't mind paying fees.

623
00:43:25,216 --> 00:43:27,707
The college and coaching class
that you study in..

624
00:43:28,185 --> 00:43:29,379
..I study there too.

625
00:43:29,487 --> 00:43:31,387
Why do I need reservation then?

626
00:43:31,856 --> 00:43:35,257
We are very fortunate to
have a friend like you.

627
00:43:35,826 --> 00:43:39,284
I wish everyone would think like
you. It would be really nice.

628
00:43:39,463 --> 00:43:40,862
Yes! -Great!

629
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:43,859
Excuse me, sir.

630
00:43:49,507 --> 00:43:52,135
Now tell me, what
is your problem?

631
00:43:53,444 --> 00:43:55,241
I don't have any problem, sir.

632
00:43:56,147 --> 00:43:58,672
Look. There is no need
to be scared.

633
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:00,408
Tell me.

634
00:44:01,752 --> 00:44:04,220
No sir. It's nothing like that.

635
00:44:06,257 --> 00:44:10,626
Do you understand what we
explain in class or not?

636
00:44:11,729 --> 00:44:12,855
Yes sir.

637
00:44:14,432 --> 00:44:16,093
Why do you always fail then?

638
00:44:21,372 --> 00:44:23,101
Sit. Please sit.

639
00:44:26,744 --> 00:44:30,111
Sir, I work a lot but..

640
00:44:37,488 --> 00:44:39,683
Here, drink some water.

641
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:42,122
Drink it.

642
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:51,492
Look Navneet, I think the actual
problem is something else.

643
00:44:52,336 --> 00:44:55,203
Tell me, we may find
a solution to it.

644
00:44:55,373 --> 00:44:58,774
Sir, I'm scared of physics,
chemistry and maths.

645
00:45:00,678 --> 00:45:03,647
What do you aspire to become?
I want to be a writer, sir.

646
00:45:04,281 --> 00:45:05,441
That's really nice.

647
00:45:05,649 --> 00:45:07,173
That is a good thing.

648
00:45:07,551 --> 00:45:10,213
But then you should opt for
literature. -I know sir..

649
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:12,521
..but my father doesn't
allow me to.

650
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:16,719
Tell your father that I asked
you to take up arts.

651
00:45:17,094 --> 00:45:18,186
Then he'll agree.

652
00:45:19,096 --> 00:45:20,154
Is that ok?

653
00:45:20,398 --> 00:45:21,558
Now come on.

654
00:45:21,799 --> 00:45:23,096
Give me a smile.

655
00:45:33,344 --> 00:45:35,107
Good. -Papa.

656
00:45:37,248 --> 00:45:41,378
Papa, my physics lecturer says
that I'm better off in arts.

657
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:47,147
Papa, let me leave my
engineering coaching class..

658
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:50,622
..so that I can concentrate
on my 11th grade exams.

659
00:45:55,666 --> 00:45:58,157
Any request you put forward
before me is futile..

660
00:45:59,503 --> 00:46:01,471
..and you better do
what you are told!

661
00:46:12,249 --> 00:46:15,343
What could be worse!
He was never good.

662
00:46:18,722 --> 00:46:20,656
Mother, I'm leaving
for school. Bye!

663
00:46:20,758 --> 00:46:22,726
Sister! -Pinki.

664
00:46:23,194 --> 00:46:26,163
Pinki, come on. Its
time for school.

665
00:46:26,397 --> 00:46:28,388
I won't go. -Why not?

666
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:30,600
I won't go to school.

667
00:46:31,135 --> 00:46:33,467
Let her be if she doesn't
want to go to school.

668
00:46:34,505 --> 00:46:36,564
How old is she though?
2 and a half.

669
00:46:37,641 --> 00:46:40,109
She's very young. Why are
you harassing her?

670
00:46:40,211 --> 00:46:42,679
I have to get her admitted
in a nursery next year.

671
00:46:43,314 --> 00:46:45,214
These days, for admission
into good schools..

672
00:46:45,282 --> 00:46:46,840
..many tests have to be passed.

673
00:46:47,218 --> 00:46:49,311
If I don't send her now, how
will she get used to it?

674
00:46:49,487 --> 00:46:52,581
Yes but if you force her like
this she won't be able to study.

675
00:46:53,124 --> 00:46:54,489
She will hate studying.

676
00:46:55,526 --> 00:46:58,290
I can't explain it to
you. Come on, Pinki.

677
00:46:58,496 --> 00:47:00,623
Come quickly. -l
won't go, mother.

678
00:47:01,732 --> 00:47:03,256
Mother, this lady is..

679
00:47:03,467 --> 00:47:06,129
Can't she teach Pinki even
though she is well educated?

680
00:47:07,271 --> 00:47:08,704
What can we do?

681
00:47:15,479 --> 00:47:16,844
Hello. -Hi.

682
00:47:17,548 --> 00:47:19,812
What is it? You have
no comments today.

683
00:47:20,518 --> 00:47:23,612
Alright, I'll do it.
You look terrible.

684
00:47:23,721 --> 00:47:25,712
What? -I'm kidding.

685
00:47:25,856 --> 00:47:28,086
Actually, you look very sexy.

686
00:47:28,526 --> 00:47:32,189
Look, my mood is very bad.
Leave me alone please!

687
00:47:32,296 --> 00:47:34,321
How can I just leave you alone?

688
00:47:34,865 --> 00:47:37,595
I am standing next to you,
you will feel better.

689
00:47:37,835 --> 00:47:40,827
You have no brains, right? You
don't know how to talk to me?

690
00:47:41,372 --> 00:47:43,602
Just don't talk to me!

691
00:47:46,477 --> 00:47:47,535
Hey buddy.

692
00:47:51,315 --> 00:47:53,442
Why are you lost? Why were
you arguing like that?

693
00:47:53,551 --> 00:47:56,645
Its nothing, friend. Vaishnavi
scolded me for no reason.

694
00:47:58,589 --> 00:48:00,682
You know her!

695
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:04,420
She says anything when she
is angry. Isn't it?

696
00:48:05,229 --> 00:48:07,060
Forget it. Let's go
to the canteen.

697
00:48:07,198 --> 00:48:09,462
Go on. I'll get the
others. -Ok.

698
00:48:14,405 --> 00:48:16,134
Hi. -Hi.

699
00:48:17,107 --> 00:48:19,371
Are you going to the
canteen? Come on.

700
00:48:28,485 --> 00:48:30,282
Sit. I'll get tea.

701
00:48:31,255 --> 00:48:33,416
Do you want to eat something?
No. Just tea.

702
00:48:44,468 --> 00:48:45,765
Thank you.

703
00:48:46,136 --> 00:48:48,764
I heard that you are a
bit off-mood today.

704
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,772
Who dared to spoil your mood?

705
00:48:52,443 --> 00:48:54,877
It's nothing. -Will you tell
me or should I hit you?

706
00:48:55,579 --> 00:48:58,104
You saw Pinki in my party,
right? -Yes.

707
00:48:58,148 --> 00:48:59,740
That small kid, right? -Yes.

708
00:49:00,117 --> 00:49:02,677
Her mother wants to send her
to a play-school by force.

709
00:49:03,153 --> 00:49:05,417
She needs a playground
and not a play-school.

710
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:08,251
Why don't parents
understand kids?

711
00:49:08,459 --> 00:49:10,393
That is because they don't
want to understand.

712
00:49:10,494 --> 00:49:12,655
They think that they know
everything about the world.

713
00:49:12,796 --> 00:49:14,525
We don't know anything at all!

714
00:49:14,732 --> 00:49:16,290
Some are like my parents.

715
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:18,232
For their prestige, they
force their kids.

716
00:49:18,302 --> 00:49:20,600
Oh God! Explain it
to these parents.

717
00:49:20,738 --> 00:49:22,330
Even God can't explain it.

718
00:49:22,473 --> 00:49:24,100
That is the reason
why he is quiet.

719
00:49:24,241 --> 00:49:25,708
I want to be a painter..

720
00:49:26,277 --> 00:49:29,303
..and my father is adamant about
making me an engineer.

721
00:49:29,513 --> 00:49:32,676
My case is different. I want
to be an engineer..

722
00:49:32,783 --> 00:49:34,683
..but my father wants me
to become a doctor..

723
00:49:34,752 --> 00:49:36,310
..so that I can handle
his clinic.

724
00:49:36,453 --> 00:49:39,217
Friend, this boy is
poor in biology.

725
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:40,687
How will he get a seat then?

726
00:49:40,791 --> 00:49:42,258
There is a management quota.

727
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:45,294
Don't get us killed. I'll never
come to you for medication.

728
00:49:45,629 --> 00:49:47,790
Nor will we! -That is true.

729
00:49:48,399 --> 00:49:50,094
Without calibre and interest..

730
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,634
..a professional course like
medicine shouldn't be attempted.

731
00:49:52,736 --> 00:49:54,294
Forget about their problems..

732
00:49:54,405 --> 00:49:56,134
..people's lives are at
a risk due to that.

733
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,800
There is another problem due
to that. -What is that?

734
00:49:59,143 --> 00:50:00,770
In medical colleges,
these days..

735
00:50:00,878 --> 00:50:04,245
..a management quota seat
is worth 25 lakhs.

736
00:50:04,381 --> 00:50:07,646
By the time the course is over
more than 50 lakhs are spent.

737
00:50:08,118 --> 00:50:11,485
It is obvious that for getting
back that huge amount..

738
00:50:11,655 --> 00:50:13,555
..doctors charge enormous fees.

739
00:50:13,757 --> 00:50:16,624
For a headache, thousands
of rupees are spent.

740
00:50:17,127 --> 00:50:20,187
Whether a person survives
in this system or not..

741
00:50:20,664 --> 00:50:22,598
..but he becomes like
a living corpse.

742
00:50:23,734 --> 00:50:26,464
What's the use of
thinking over..

743
00:50:26,804 --> 00:50:28,704
..something we can't change?

744
00:50:31,141 --> 00:50:32,369
Shall we leave now?

745
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:36,771
Son..

746
00:50:37,448 --> 00:50:40,440
Mother! I sat with Varun,
Nitin and Bharat..

747
00:50:40,517 --> 00:50:42,178
..and solved 30 to 40 problems
such as this.

748
00:50:42,252 --> 00:50:44,277
But when I do it by myself l
can't solve a single one.

749
00:50:44,355 --> 00:50:45,879
Mummy, please help me.

750
00:50:46,357 --> 00:50:48,518
Son, at least try
it. You'll do it.

751
00:50:48,692 --> 00:50:50,819
I can't do it, mother. I'm
not getting any solutions.

752
00:50:50,928 --> 00:50:52,725
Please help me, mother. -Sit.

753
00:50:54,531 --> 00:50:55,623
You'll do it.

754
00:52:22,786 --> 00:52:25,186
Was that you? -I don't
see Navneet around.

755
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:27,154
I don't know. I have been looking
for him since a long time too.

756
00:52:27,257 --> 00:52:29,623
I haven't seen him yet.
I don't understand.

757
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:34,763
There!

758
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,533
It has been two hours since
the exams ended.

759
00:52:37,701 --> 00:52:40,261
He has been searching for you
there and you're standing here!

760
00:52:40,471 --> 00:52:42,371
Anyway, how was the exam?

761
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,374
I didn't give the exams well.

762
00:52:46,743 --> 00:52:51,203
If I fail, my father
will kill me!

763
00:52:51,448 --> 00:52:53,143
It will be nothing like that.

764
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:56,151
'You'll get very good marks.'
I won't say that.

765
00:52:56,286 --> 00:52:59,221
You will pass though.
Don't worry, pal.

766
00:52:59,389 --> 00:53:01,323
Everything will be
alright. Come.

767
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:04,116
Come along.

768
00:53:23,447 --> 00:53:25,540
Don't look at a sleeping
child like that.

769
00:53:25,649 --> 00:53:27,207
It may cast an evil eye.

770
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:33,246
When he is awake, I don't
get to see him like this.

771
00:53:34,324 --> 00:53:39,557
College, coaching classes
followed by a lot of homework!

772
00:53:42,165 --> 00:53:43,632
You are right.

773
00:53:44,868 --> 00:53:48,429
Kids today can't even live
their childhood properly.

774
00:53:49,273 --> 00:53:52,572
They don't have time
to play or to sleep.

775
00:53:54,144 --> 00:53:55,406
What can be done?

776
00:53:56,179 --> 00:53:57,646
The system is like that.

777
00:53:58,782 --> 00:54:01,444
We have to go with the others.

778
00:54:09,526 --> 00:54:13,257
Students, the class is over.
Shut down your computers.

779
00:54:14,364 --> 00:54:17,527
Come on, hurry up. What are
you doing? Hurry up please.

780
00:54:34,484 --> 00:54:36,509
What are you doing with
Vaishnavi's bag?

781
00:54:36,587 --> 00:54:37,884
What do you have
to do with that?

782
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:40,587
Many things go on between
Vaishnavi and me.

783
00:54:40,691 --> 00:54:43,125
Look, I am Vaishnavi's
best friend.

784
00:54:43,293 --> 00:54:45,193
So I have a right to know this.

785
00:54:45,362 --> 00:54:47,557
You are Vaishnavi's best friend?

786
00:54:48,332 --> 00:54:50,357
Come on. I'll prove
it right now. Come!

787
00:54:50,634 --> 00:54:53,194
Come on.

788
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:56,338
Vaishnavi, I am your
best friend, right?

789
00:54:56,506 --> 00:54:59,134
Yes, why? -Explain it to him.

790
00:54:59,576 --> 00:55:02,170
He was putting some paper
into your bag. -Paper?

791
00:55:02,279 --> 00:55:04,110
Look in his hands.

792
00:55:12,322 --> 00:55:13,789
Here's your 50 rupees.

793
00:55:15,258 --> 00:55:19,388
As you promised me, don't tell
this to anyone please.

794
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,755
What was that? -During
a physics lecture..

795
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:26,228
..the professor Sgave a problem
from HC. Varma's book.

796
00:55:26,436 --> 00:55:27,835
He didn't understand
that problem.

797
00:55:28,105 --> 00:55:29,402
So I explained it to him.

798
00:55:29,506 --> 00:55:31,440
So? -So what?

799
00:55:32,209 --> 00:55:34,109
Prakash is the classes' topper.

800
00:55:34,344 --> 00:55:37,177
If someone would know
this in the class..

801
00:55:37,414 --> 00:55:39,405
..he would lose his
prestige, right?

802
00:55:39,549 --> 00:55:43,280
Our corrupt Vaishnavi,
for hiding this..

803
00:55:43,587 --> 00:55:45,817
..must have asked for
50 rupees. Isn't it?

804
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:48,549
You cheater! -What's
my fault in this?

805
00:55:48,725 --> 00:55:50,158
It is your mistake.

806
00:55:50,327 --> 00:55:52,124
Why did you get caught
by Abhinav?

807
00:55:53,263 --> 00:55:54,890
Navneet, your father has come.

808
00:55:55,499 --> 00:55:57,228
He's sitting in the office room.

809
00:55:57,601 --> 00:55:59,432
The principal has
called for you.

810
00:56:02,105 --> 00:56:03,163
Go on.

811
00:56:03,273 --> 00:56:06,834
Navneet, I think you
should take arts..

812
00:56:07,144 --> 00:56:10,409
..because you really incline
towards it and.. -Excuse me!

813
00:56:11,181 --> 00:56:12,808
How can you decide that?

814
00:56:13,183 --> 00:56:14,582
I totally understand, sir.

815
00:56:15,085 --> 00:56:19,215
You don't try to realise Navneet
will benefit through this.

816
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:23,389
Look at his mid-term marks.

817
00:56:33,236 --> 00:56:34,863
His marks are pretty good.
Look at the physics..

818
00:56:35,138 --> 00:56:36,662
..chemistry and maths marks.

819
00:56:49,319 --> 00:56:51,310
I understand what
the problem is.

820
00:56:52,322 --> 00:56:54,756
Sir, give me one more chance.

821
00:56:56,126 --> 00:56:58,390
Its not that, sir.. -Thank
you for your help!

822
00:57:00,163 --> 00:57:01,460
Come on, boy. Lets go.

823
00:57:09,473 --> 00:57:13,432
Listen, you may fool your
principal and teacher..

824
00:57:14,611 --> 00:57:16,306
..but I am not an idiot.

825
00:57:16,713 --> 00:57:18,772
I know very well what
your plan is.

826
00:57:20,117 --> 00:57:22,312
Come on home. I'll see you!

827
00:57:42,139 --> 00:57:47,509
Search for it. I'll look too.

828
00:57:48,445 --> 00:57:54,145
Search for it. I'll look too.

829
00:57:54,751 --> 00:58:00,621
The nights that I have lost.
The forgotten event.

830
00:58:01,224 --> 00:58:07,163
What more can I tell you?

831
00:58:07,564 --> 00:58:13,127
Search for it. I'll look too.

832
00:58:14,104 --> 00:58:19,508
Search for it. I'll look too.

833
00:58:20,377 --> 00:58:26,316
The sleep that I lost. My
memory that is gone.

834
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:32,552
What more can I tell you?

835
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:38,822
I will slowly disappear.

836
00:58:39,563 --> 00:58:45,263
I'll sorrowfully be
lost in the moment.

837
00:58:46,102 --> 00:58:51,563
Search for it. I'll look too.

838
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:33,745
Whenever I was close,
you were with me.

839
00:59:37,187 --> 00:59:43,524
Whenever I stayed away,
you were still with me.

840
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:53,092
Now the world that l
have left to seek.

841
00:59:53,236 --> 00:59:59,436
There is no one with me.
I will leave silently.

842
00:59:59,609 --> 01:00:05,309
I looked and searched
everywhere.

843
01:00:06,116 --> 01:00:11,383
Everywhere the only
thing I found was..

844
01:00:51,594 --> 01:00:54,563
Sir! Sir! Navneet
has fallen sir.

845
01:00:54,664 --> 01:00:56,825
A lot of blood has flown
away, sir. Come on!

846
01:01:22,359 --> 01:01:24,156
I'm sorry. He's no more.

847
01:01:24,361 --> 01:01:26,124
Sir! Doctor!

848
01:01:31,501 --> 01:01:33,401
Doctor! -No!

849
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:35,398
Doctor!

850
01:01:37,207 --> 01:01:38,299
Doctor!

851
01:01:47,851 --> 01:01:53,380
It was a silent evening.
There were no dreams.

852
01:01:54,357 --> 01:01:59,852
It was a silent evening.
There were no dreams.

853
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:06,626
I never could express
that condition.

854
01:02:07,137 --> 01:02:13,098
What more can I tell you?

855
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:18,607
Search for it. I'll look too.

856
01:02:19,816 --> 01:02:25,550
Search for it. I'll look too.

857
01:02:27,724 --> 01:02:29,749
Yesterday 13 days passed
since his death.

858
01:02:31,461 --> 01:02:34,521
If Navneet's father hadn't put
too much pressure on him..

859
01:02:35,465 --> 01:02:37,695
..he would never have
committed suicide.

860
01:02:38,635 --> 01:02:41,229
If the cause of Navneet's
suicide is his father..

861
01:02:41,571 --> 01:02:43,436
..why doesn't the police
arrest him?

862
01:02:43,573 --> 01:02:46,701
Why don't you talk to your young
uncle regarding this?

863
01:02:47,444 --> 01:02:48,638
She won't go alone.

864
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,541
We'll all go and talk to him.

865
01:02:52,649 --> 01:02:55,209
Yes. That will be right.

866
01:02:55,552 --> 01:02:56,849
Let's do that then.

867
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:59,688
We'll go today in the evening
and meet Mr. Sanjay.

868
01:03:00,523 --> 01:03:01,683
Alright. -Ok.

869
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:13,200
What is it? The entire gang
is in my office today.

870
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,730
You appear to be one short.

871
01:03:21,211 --> 01:03:23,111
What is it? Tell me something.

872
01:03:25,148 --> 01:03:27,673
Navneet's father killed
him. -What?

873
01:03:28,885 --> 01:03:32,480
The day we were getting our
term exams' results..

874
01:03:33,556 --> 01:03:36,491
..the principal called
for Navneet's father.

875
01:03:38,361 --> 01:03:40,659
I don't know what
happened inside..

876
01:03:42,265 --> 01:03:46,133
..but when Navneet came out,
he was very scared.

877
01:03:46,503 --> 01:03:48,733
His father's face
showed anger too.

878
01:03:49,806 --> 01:03:51,637
He even threatened him saying..

879
01:03:52,242 --> 01:03:54,472
'Come home, I'll see you.'

880
01:03:54,777 --> 01:03:57,211
I told them about this too.

881
01:03:57,847 --> 01:03:59,747
We were going to
go to him when..

882
01:04:02,318 --> 01:04:06,084
He jumped off the school terrace
and committed suicide.

883
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:11,754
Uncle, another Navneet
mustn't die.

884
01:04:12,595 --> 01:04:15,223
That is the only salute we
want to give our friend.

885
01:04:15,698 --> 01:04:17,689
We are ready to do
anything for this.

886
01:04:18,201 --> 01:04:19,691
Show us the way now.

887
01:04:57,307 --> 01:04:58,365
Come on.

888
01:05:09,152 --> 01:05:10,517
Hello inspector.

889
01:05:11,788 --> 01:05:14,279
There was a St. Joseph
college student's..

890
01:05:15,091 --> 01:05:17,559
..suicide case. May
I see its FlR?

891
01:05:18,328 --> 01:05:19,488
Who are you?

892
01:05:21,097 --> 01:05:25,227
I'm advocate Sanjay.

893
01:05:41,317 --> 01:05:44,252
Why didn't you write the reason
for Navneet's suicide in this?

894
01:05:45,455 --> 01:05:49,186
Sir, look carefully. He had
low marks in his exams.

895
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:51,884
He was depressed. That is
why he committed suicide.

896
01:05:52,729 --> 01:05:55,596
I want to correct you
a little, inspector.

897
01:05:56,699 --> 01:05:59,463
How his dad would beat him
up for getting low marks..

898
01:06:00,203 --> 01:06:02,228
..thinking this, he
committed suicide.

899
01:06:03,072 --> 01:06:05,597
Look, parents do hit
their children.

900
01:06:05,775 --> 01:06:07,766
However, their intention
is never wrong.

901
01:06:08,077 --> 01:06:10,477
We cannot accuse him
in this case.

902
01:06:11,381 --> 01:06:14,248
Even spouses fight but if the
husband's oppression..

903
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:18,446
..goes beyond a limit, we have
a case against him, right?

904
01:06:18,588 --> 01:06:20,453
Tell me. -That's
a different case.

905
01:06:21,157 --> 01:06:23,091
A wife would accuse
her husband there.

906
01:06:23,226 --> 01:06:25,091
That is why we take action.
But in this case..

907
01:06:25,194 --> 01:06:26,752
..no one has laid an accusation.

908
01:06:29,532 --> 01:06:32,262
He lays an accusation.
Yes sir.

909
01:06:33,569 --> 01:06:36,436
Navneet's father scolded
him a lot that day.

910
01:06:37,173 --> 01:06:38,333
He said..

911
01:06:39,609 --> 01:06:41,600
'Come home, I'll see you.'

912
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:46,571
Navneet was very scared
to hear this.

913
01:06:47,617 --> 01:06:48,811
I was there too.

914
01:06:50,853 --> 01:06:53,253
Will you be able to say
all this in the court?

915
01:06:53,489 --> 01:06:54,581
Surely.

916
01:06:56,392 --> 01:06:57,450
Ok.

917
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:25,746
Mr. Sanjay will act as private
counsel for the complainants.

918
01:07:26,489 --> 01:07:29,720
But he will act under
the guidance of..

919
01:07:30,393 --> 01:07:31,860
..the public prosecutor.

920
01:07:32,695 --> 01:07:34,185
Thank you, your honour.

921
01:07:35,465 --> 01:07:40,232
He played a major part
in killing his son.

922
01:07:41,404 --> 01:07:45,170
That is why I request the
court to punish him..

923
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:47,775
..so that no other parent..

924
01:07:48,211 --> 01:07:50,679
..would not pressurise
their kids like this..

925
01:07:51,114 --> 01:07:53,514
..and they may get a right
to live their life.

926
01:07:53,649 --> 01:07:56,209
Your honour, I think this
is a open and shut case.

927
01:07:56,719 --> 01:07:58,687
Every parent loves his child.

928
01:07:58,855 --> 01:08:01,722
Whatever they do, it will be
for their kids' well-being.

929
01:08:02,425 --> 01:08:04,052
You are 100 percent right.

930
01:08:04,193 --> 01:08:06,718
Can you do something
for me? -What?

931
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:15,296
Fold them one after the
other and show me..

932
01:08:15,438 --> 01:08:17,463
..how much you can
bend them. -What?

933
01:08:18,541 --> 01:08:19,667
Please.

934
01:08:20,376 --> 01:08:22,571
What do you want to
prove through this?

935
01:08:23,746 --> 01:08:26,374
Your honour, I think the advocate
is a believer not of evidence..

936
01:08:26,482 --> 01:08:28,416
..but of such tomfoolery.

937
01:08:28,751 --> 01:08:30,343
I'm sorry I cannot do that.

938
01:08:33,289 --> 01:08:36,281
Can I have the court
clerk do this?

939
01:08:36,626 --> 01:08:37,684
Ok.

940
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:51,532
Your honour..

941
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:55,439
..you saw that they
both have limits.

942
01:08:56,179 --> 01:08:59,444
When plastic was bended more
than its capacity, it broke.

943
01:09:00,049 --> 01:09:04,281
That is why we use things
according to their capacity.

944
01:09:05,154 --> 01:09:08,783
You must have noticed that whenever
we use a glass material..

945
01:09:09,091 --> 01:09:10,581
..we automatically say..

946
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:13,595
'Be careful! Careful,
brother. Its glass.'

947
01:09:14,697 --> 01:09:18,064
Your honour, our kids are
more fragile than glass.

948
01:09:18,701 --> 01:09:20,498
We should handle them with care.

949
01:09:21,437 --> 01:09:22,563
This man!

950
01:09:22,738 --> 01:09:27,141
This man didn't handle his
son with care and he died.

951
01:09:27,443 --> 01:09:29,308
We are fighting this case..

952
01:09:29,412 --> 01:09:31,744
..so that it doesn't happen
with any other kid.

953
01:09:33,683 --> 01:09:36,151
Your honour, these days even
if parents refuse..

954
01:09:36,219 --> 01:09:38,779
..kids from watching movies,
they try to commit suicide.

955
01:09:38,855 --> 01:09:40,345
Objection, your honour!

956
01:09:41,123 --> 01:09:43,421
These things have nothing
to do with this case.

957
01:09:43,559 --> 01:09:45,789
Objection sustained.

958
01:09:46,796 --> 01:09:49,424
But I would like to request
my friend advocate to..

959
01:09:50,099 --> 01:09:54,195
..prove the pointless accusations
made against my client.

960
01:09:54,871 --> 01:09:58,739
In a court, justice is granted
by evidence not by speeches.

961
01:10:02,245 --> 01:10:04,611
My first witness is
inspector Manoj.

962
01:10:08,818 --> 01:10:12,117
Will you tell the court what
happened on November 10?

963
01:10:12,388 --> 01:10:14,413
Sir, on November 10
in the morning..

964
01:10:14,557 --> 01:10:16,752
..the principal of St. Joseph's
college called me.

965
01:10:16,859 --> 01:10:19,123
He said that a kid has
fallen off the roof.

966
01:10:19,228 --> 01:10:21,196
Come immediately. l
reached there soon.

967
01:10:22,131 --> 01:10:23,428
What did you see there?

968
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:27,393
When I reached there I saw that
a child was drenched in blood.

969
01:10:27,803 --> 01:10:30,294
A doctor was checking
his pulse..

970
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:33,304
..and later the doctor
pronounced him dead.

971
01:10:33,576 --> 01:10:36,374
What did you do? -I did
my usual enquiry.

972
01:10:36,612 --> 01:10:39,479
I found out that
he had no enemy.

973
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:41,810
He didn't fight with
anyone either.

974
01:10:42,351 --> 01:10:45,149
What kind of a boy was Navneet
in your enquiry?

975
01:10:45,388 --> 01:10:48,721
According to my enquiry, he was
a boy of a very gentle nature.

976
01:10:48,891 --> 01:10:51,325
Everyone in the college
loved him a lot.

977
01:10:52,194 --> 01:10:53,923
Please note this point,
your honour.

978
01:10:55,765 --> 01:10:56,925
How did he die?

979
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:59,429
Look, he went to the roof alone.

980
01:10:59,635 --> 01:11:01,364
He jumped from there and
committed suicide.

981
01:11:01,504 --> 01:11:04,701
What reason did you state
in the normal FlR?

982
01:11:04,774 --> 01:11:07,265
He didn't get good marks
in term exams.

983
01:11:07,343 --> 01:11:09,277
He was quite depressed.

984
01:11:09,545 --> 01:11:12,639
How did you file a charge-sheet on
Mr.Manjeet Singh's name then?

985
01:11:14,784 --> 01:11:17,719
Inspector, you are under oath.

986
01:11:19,155 --> 01:11:20,520
Tell me the truth.

987
01:11:20,623 --> 01:11:23,387
Objection, your honour. He
is scaring the witness.

988
01:11:23,559 --> 01:11:27,689
No, your honour. I am reminding
him his responsibility.

989
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:29,320
Objection over-ruled.

990
01:11:29,632 --> 01:11:31,896
Inspector, please give details.

991
01:11:32,435 --> 01:11:33,663
Yes, your honour.

992
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:36,695
Students of St. Joseph college
came with him to me.

993
01:11:36,772 --> 01:11:39,741
They accused Mr. Singh.

994
01:11:40,276 --> 01:11:41,470
They said that..

995
01:11:41,577 --> 01:11:44,341
..it was due to his father that
Navneet committed suicide.

996
01:11:44,614 --> 01:11:46,775
Why didn't you carry
out an enquiry and..

997
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:51,446
..file a charge-sheet against
him then? -Well, I.. I mean..

998
01:11:53,489 --> 01:11:56,424
I took it casually. -
Why did you do that?

999
01:11:57,326 --> 01:11:59,157
I'm sorry to say this but..

1000
01:12:00,129 --> 01:12:04,361
..this situation goes on in 60
percent of our country's houses.

1001
01:12:04,467 --> 01:12:08,563
Till today no one has taken
it as a criminal act.

1002
01:12:11,207 --> 01:12:12,265
Thank you.

1003
01:12:15,144 --> 01:12:16,406
Your witness please.

1004
01:12:16,679 --> 01:12:19,648
Inspector, do you remember the
section 306 of the constitution?

1005
01:12:19,782 --> 01:12:21,113
Yes sir.

1006
01:12:21,384 --> 01:12:23,852
According to the penal code,
if anyone commits suicide..

1007
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,213
..and whoever abets the
commission of such suicide..

1008
01:12:26,322 --> 01:12:28,620
..shall be punished with
imprisonment of either..

1009
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:31,487
..description of a term which
may extend up to 10 years..

1010
01:12:31,794 --> 01:12:33,762
..or shall also be
liable to fine.

1011
01:12:34,697 --> 01:12:35,755
Good.

1012
01:12:36,132 --> 01:12:38,362
So, my client Mr. Singh.

1013
01:12:38,534 --> 01:12:41,128
Is he guilty of crime
under this section?

1014
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:44,330
No, sir. A person is guilty
under this act..

1015
01:12:44,407 --> 01:12:47,638
..only when he on purpose forces
someone to commit suicide.

1016
01:12:47,777 --> 01:12:50,871
In this case, however, Mr. Singh
doesn't have this intention.

1017
01:12:51,614 --> 01:12:53,138
That's all your honour.

1018
01:12:53,382 --> 01:12:56,283
A person who isn't a criminal
under the Indian Penal Code..

1019
01:12:56,652 --> 01:12:59,143
We don't have any right to
file a case against him.

1020
01:13:02,692 --> 01:13:04,091
No, your honour.

1021
01:13:04,794 --> 01:13:06,125
Look at this.

1022
01:13:06,862 --> 01:13:08,557
Many kids today..

1023
01:13:09,265 --> 01:13:12,860
..are committing suicide
due to this problem.

1024
01:13:15,271 --> 01:13:17,501
This is evidence
number one, sir.

1025
01:13:25,715 --> 01:13:28,582
Parents today have become
over-ambitious.

1026
01:13:29,618 --> 01:13:33,179
They demand more than the
possible limit from their kids.

1027
01:13:33,489 --> 01:13:35,719
They want to have their
kids top the class.

1028
01:13:35,891 --> 01:13:39,122
That is the reason why there is
extra pressure on their minds.

1029
01:13:39,261 --> 01:13:41,729
All of this proves that.

1030
01:13:42,531 --> 01:13:45,796
The law has been made for our
benefit and assistance.

1031
01:13:46,268 --> 01:13:49,704
That is why we have made many
amendments in the constitution.

1032
01:13:50,573 --> 01:13:53,440
Now it has become a social case.

1033
01:13:53,576 --> 01:13:56,306
We will begin it from here.

1034
01:13:56,879 --> 01:14:00,212
The case is accepted. The court
is adjourned for today.

1035
01:14:15,698 --> 01:14:19,225
Oh my dear child.

1036
01:14:22,338 --> 01:14:25,273
Oh my dear child.

1037
01:14:25,574 --> 01:14:28,475
Oh my dear child.

1038
01:14:28,811 --> 01:14:32,110
You will eat food derived
from fresh crops.

1039
01:14:32,248 --> 01:14:34,876
You will eat food derived
from fresh crops.

1040
01:14:35,184 --> 01:14:38,176
Now be happy and sleep.

1041
01:14:38,454 --> 01:14:41,480
Now be happy and sleep.

1042
01:14:44,894 --> 01:14:48,125
Now be happy and sleep.

1043
01:14:48,664 --> 01:14:53,431
Oh my dear child.

1044
01:15:22,264 --> 01:15:28,396
Sleep doesn't know
when to come.

1045
01:15:28,671 --> 01:15:34,632
We will have to inform it
that it has to come now.

1046
01:15:34,743 --> 01:15:41,114
We don't know when
it may come.

1047
01:15:41,383 --> 01:15:47,185
The lullaby has been
lost in a night.

1048
01:15:47,857 --> 01:15:50,758
Oh my dear child.

1049
01:15:51,126 --> 01:15:54,118
Listen to me, my dear child.

1050
01:15:54,196 --> 01:15:59,327
Close your eyes with
love. It will come.

1051
01:16:01,103 --> 01:16:03,799
Oh my dear child.

1052
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:07,241
Oh my dear child.

1053
01:16:07,576 --> 01:16:10,670
You will eat food derived
from fresh crops.

1054
01:16:10,813 --> 01:16:13,646
You will eat food derived
from fresh crops.

1055
01:16:13,749 --> 01:16:16,775
Now be happy and sleep.

1056
01:16:17,186 --> 01:16:20,121
Now be happy and sleep.

1057
01:16:47,683 --> 01:16:51,119
The evening is coming
to an end.

1058
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:54,155
The moon has risen in the sky.

1059
01:16:54,390 --> 01:17:00,260
The fog took its view away.

1060
01:17:00,362 --> 01:17:06,323
O moon, what mistake
did I make?

1061
01:17:06,769 --> 01:17:12,833
Now tell me whether you
will ever see me.

1062
01:17:13,442 --> 01:17:16,377
Oh my dear child.

1063
01:17:16,545 --> 01:17:19,480
Listen to me, my dear child.

1064
01:17:19,615 --> 01:17:25,178
Close your eyes with
love. It will come.

1065
01:17:26,622 --> 01:17:29,591
Oh my dear child.

1066
01:17:29,825 --> 01:17:32,817
Oh my dear child.

1067
01:17:33,195 --> 01:17:36,323
You will eat food derived
from fresh crops.

1068
01:17:36,498 --> 01:17:39,331
You will eat food derived
from fresh crops.

1069
01:17:39,435 --> 01:17:42,404
Now be happy and sleep.

1070
01:17:42,705 --> 01:17:45,765
Now be happy and sleep.

1071
01:17:49,311 --> 01:17:52,337
Now be happy and sleep.

1072
01:17:52,881 --> 01:17:58,478
Oh my dear child.

1073
01:18:06,395 --> 01:18:07,487
Aunt..

1074
01:18:09,131 --> 01:18:11,691
..if by filing a case
against uncle..

1075
01:18:12,534 --> 01:18:16,163
..we have increased your sorrow,
we will take back the case.

1076
01:18:19,575 --> 01:18:22,510
No, son. Whatever you
are doing is right.

1077
01:18:23,145 --> 01:18:24,772
At least a helpless mother
like me wouldn't..

1078
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,775
..have to lose her
child in future.

1079
01:18:34,123 --> 01:18:37,183
Mr. Mishra, you are under
oath. -Yes sir.

1080
01:18:38,227 --> 01:18:40,092
What work do you do?

1081
01:18:40,696 --> 01:18:42,630
I teach physics in St.
Joseph college.

1082
01:18:42,865 --> 01:18:45,663
For how many years have you been
teaching now? -10 years.

1083
01:18:47,302 --> 01:18:50,271
With your experience, you
can understand children.

1084
01:18:51,173 --> 01:18:52,265
Yes sir.

1085
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:55,104
Navneet was your student.

1086
01:18:55,577 --> 01:18:56,635
Yes sir.

1087
01:18:58,213 --> 01:19:01,512
Was Navneet suitable
to study science?

1088
01:19:01,717 --> 01:19:03,207
Objection your honour!

1089
01:19:04,553 --> 01:19:07,113
This is a leading question.
Objection sustained.

1090
01:19:10,726 --> 01:19:13,820
Alright, I'll ask this
question differently.

1091
01:19:15,431 --> 01:19:17,524
What opinion do you
have about Navneet?

1092
01:19:18,767 --> 01:19:20,132
The boy was decent.

1093
01:19:20,803 --> 01:19:24,398
He was hard-working too but he
wasn't suitable for science.

1094
01:19:25,841 --> 01:19:28,105
On what basis do you say this?

1095
01:19:29,211 --> 01:19:33,409
He had 90 percent marks in
English and he failed sciences.

1096
01:19:34,416 --> 01:19:36,281
Please note this point
your honour.

1097
01:19:37,753 --> 01:19:40,278
Did you tell his father
about this?

1098
01:19:41,590 --> 01:19:44,150
Yes sir. -What was
his reaction?

1099
01:19:46,628 --> 01:19:48,425
He controlled his anger..

1100
01:19:49,832 --> 01:19:51,697
..and requested for
another chance.

1101
01:19:53,435 --> 01:19:56,495
Why do you think Navneet
committed suicide?

1102
01:19:56,839 --> 01:19:59,399
Objection your honour!
Objection sustained.

1103
01:19:59,675 --> 01:20:01,404
No more questions, your honour.

1104
01:20:02,578 --> 01:20:04,808
Your witness please. -Thank you.

1105
01:20:06,448 --> 01:20:08,348
Mr. Mishra, I don't want to
ask you many questions..

1106
01:20:08,450 --> 01:20:10,680
..and waste yours and well
as the court's time.

1107
01:20:11,186 --> 01:20:13,313
I just have some doubts
to be cleared.

1108
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:18,353
You can tell everything about
kids by your 10 year experience.

1109
01:20:18,494 --> 01:20:20,860
You just now said this in
the courtroom. -Yes sir.

1110
01:20:22,331 --> 01:20:25,767
In my experience of 12 years,
whichever client came before me..

1111
01:20:25,868 --> 01:20:28,336
..whether he is guilty
or innocent..

1112
01:20:28,637 --> 01:20:30,298
..I could never understand this.

1113
01:20:30,405 --> 01:20:32,430
I always left this decision
to the court.

1114
01:20:33,175 --> 01:20:36,508
Anyway, just tell me, from when
have you known Navneet?

1115
01:20:36,879 --> 01:20:38,710
About six months.

1116
01:20:39,548 --> 01:20:41,539
Just six months? -Yes sir.

1117
01:20:42,351 --> 01:20:44,649
His age must be around
16-17 years.

1118
01:20:45,487 --> 01:20:46,613
That's right sir.

1119
01:20:46,688 --> 01:20:50,385
You mean to say a person who
nurtured a child for 16-17 years..

1120
01:20:50,626 --> 01:20:53,527
You understood the same boy
in about six months.

1121
01:20:53,862 --> 01:20:55,921
Graduation is completed
in three years.

1122
01:20:57,166 --> 01:20:59,157
You think a person who graduates
in 13 years..

1123
01:21:01,503 --> 01:21:03,471
That is because he has
more experience.

1124
01:21:04,873 --> 01:21:08,172
What should I do about
this? -Order! Order!

1125
01:21:10,479 --> 01:21:11,844
No more questions please.

1126
01:21:15,851 --> 01:21:19,582
Your honour, I request
to pass summons..

1127
01:21:20,122 --> 01:21:23,558
..to bring Navneet's mother
and brother to court.

1128
01:21:24,393 --> 01:21:27,453
Your honour, due to Navneet's
death his mother and brother..

1129
01:21:27,696 --> 01:21:30,665
..are mentally disturbed. This
is their medical certificate.

1130
01:21:40,375 --> 01:21:42,570
The court is adjourned
for today.

1131
01:21:47,249 --> 01:21:50,810
Sir, will we win the case? -
Don't you have faith in me?

1132
01:21:50,852 --> 01:21:52,342
What we mean is that,..

1133
01:21:52,554 --> 01:21:54,920
..after this will someone take
steps like what Navneet did?

1134
01:21:56,024 --> 01:21:58,288
Will the parents put pressure
on their children?

1135
01:21:58,627 --> 01:22:00,595
Will the parents let their
children live as they wish?

1136
01:22:02,264 --> 01:22:04,289
Your intentions are good.

1137
01:22:04,833 --> 01:22:07,563
But to bring about such
a drastic change..

1138
01:22:07,903 --> 01:22:08,995
..a movement has to
be brought about.

1139
01:22:09,271 --> 01:22:10,499
What should we do for that?

1140
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:13,605
Does any of your parents..

1141
01:22:14,509 --> 01:22:15,635
..put a lot of pressure on you?

1142
01:22:15,877 --> 01:22:18,402
My parents put a lot of pressure
on me to come first..

1143
01:22:18,814 --> 01:22:20,509
..that it becomes difficult
to bear it.

1144
01:22:20,782 --> 01:22:24,274
Even if I come second or third
still I am punished at home.

1145
01:22:25,954 --> 01:22:27,819
Have you finished your
home work? -Yes mama.

1146
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:29,587
What about the home work
from the coaching class?

1147
01:22:30,626 --> 01:22:31,957
Mama, can I sleep?

1148
01:22:33,462 --> 01:22:35,020
I have to reach college at
7 in the morning and..

1149
01:22:35,297 --> 01:22:36,423
..it is already 12 now.

1150
01:22:46,775 --> 01:22:48,606
The condition of my friend
in still worse.

1151
01:22:52,614 --> 01:22:54,946
Doctor, is it something
serious? -No.

1152
01:22:54,983 --> 01:22:56,416
There is nothing to be scared.

1153
01:22:56,718 --> 01:22:59,380
Due to the pressure of studies
she is feeling hot inside..

1154
01:22:59,421 --> 01:23:00,786
..hence the bleeding
is a little more.

1155
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:03,952
A lot of children these
days face this problem.

1156
01:23:05,761 --> 01:23:08,252
All of you file a case
against your parents.

1157
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:10,261
Then I will file a PlL.

1158
01:23:10,732 --> 01:23:13,530
Tell all the children at
the college to the same.

1159
01:23:13,869 --> 01:23:16,497
This in itself will become
a big movement.

1160
01:23:20,409 --> 01:23:21,467
Meena..

1161
01:23:21,777 --> 01:23:23,039
Get these papers typed and..

1162
01:23:23,312 --> 01:23:24,711
..the get the signature
of these children.

1163
01:23:26,315 --> 01:23:27,304
Go.

1164
01:23:27,516 --> 01:23:30,280
Buddy I am finding the preparing
for engineering very hard.

1165
01:23:30,485 --> 01:23:31,679
I'm thinking of running
away from the house.

1166
01:23:32,788 --> 01:23:34,016
But why are you running
away from your house?

1167
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:35,748
You too file a case.

1168
01:23:35,957 --> 01:23:37,754
Can we also file a case?

1169
01:23:39,294 --> 01:23:42,286
Yes. -But I don't
have the money.

1170
01:23:43,065 --> 01:23:45,295
That wouldn't be necessary.
You come with us.

1171
01:23:45,367 --> 01:23:46,834
Mr. Sanjay will fight
your case too.

1172
01:23:47,069 --> 01:23:49,629
Me too! -Me too! -
Me too! -Me too!

1173
01:23:49,671 --> 01:23:52,538
Me too! -Me too! -
Me too! -Me too!

1174
01:23:56,945 --> 01:24:00,346
Sir, all these people also
want to file a case.

1175
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:03,574
Oh! -All these.

1176
01:24:04,252 --> 01:24:05,742
Take them to Meena. -Yes sir.

1177
01:24:13,328 --> 01:24:15,956
Uncle, these people also
want to file a case.

1178
01:24:19,267 --> 01:24:21,827
Good! Go to Meena.

1179
01:24:29,478 --> 01:24:30,740
Good morning sir. -Good morning
sir. -Good morning.

1180
01:24:30,912 --> 01:24:32,539
You're supporting these
children well.

1181
01:24:32,848 --> 01:24:34,679
I am only doing my duty.

1182
01:24:34,716 --> 01:24:36,047
Any comments about
these children?

1183
01:24:36,518 --> 01:24:37,678
Not only these children..

1184
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:41,050
Every child in this generation
knows what it wants.

1185
01:24:41,723 --> 01:24:42,917
If we can recognise that and..

1186
01:24:43,291 --> 01:24:44,918
..help them correctly
they can do wonders.

1187
01:24:45,394 --> 01:24:46,554
Why did you take up this case?

1188
01:24:46,661 --> 01:24:48,561
Did something like this happen
in your life too?

1189
01:24:49,297 --> 01:24:51,492
It is not necessary that
something should have happened..

1190
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,727
..in your life to help
someone. -Yes sir.

1191
01:24:54,403 --> 01:24:55,836
To make out the pain that
someone is suffering..

1192
01:24:56,438 --> 01:24:57,666
..all you need is a good heart.

1193
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,969
We can appreciate the case
against the parents. But..

1194
01:25:00,409 --> 01:25:01,967
..against the government..

1195
01:25:02,677 --> 01:25:03,666
Wait and watch.

1196
01:25:03,845 --> 01:25:06,541
Sir. -Excuse me sir. -Sir,
one more question. -Sir!

1197
01:25:06,915 --> 01:25:08,974
As we have already informed
our viewers..

1198
01:25:09,451 --> 01:25:11,385
..on 1st November, a student
of St. Joseph college..

1199
01:25:11,486 --> 01:25:13,351
..Navneet had committed suicide.

1200
01:25:13,688 --> 01:25:15,349
As an outcome of the
suicide of Navneet..

1201
01:25:15,457 --> 01:25:17,618
..there is a case filed against
his father in the court.

1202
01:25:17,826 --> 01:25:19,521
But now we have received
the news that..

1203
01:25:19,561 --> 01:25:22,291
..friends of Navneet have
also filed case..

1204
01:25:22,397 --> 01:25:23,989
..against their parents
in the high court.

1205
01:25:24,399 --> 01:25:25,866
Further other friends
of his have also..

1206
01:25:25,901 --> 01:25:26,925
..filed against the government..

1207
01:25:27,035 --> 01:25:29,367
..a Public Interest Litigation
petition.

1208
01:25:29,704 --> 01:25:31,831
When our correspondents
asked them about this..

1209
01:25:32,274 --> 01:25:34,606
..what they said let us hear
it from them itself.

1210
01:25:34,776 --> 01:25:37,506
Yes Rahul, I am standing in
front of Allahabad high court..

1211
01:25:37,546 --> 01:25:39,639
..where in the history of India
for the first time children..

1212
01:25:39,681 --> 01:25:41,512
..have filed case against
their parents.

1213
01:25:41,616 --> 01:25:42,776
And also against the
government too.

1214
01:25:42,984 --> 01:25:44,315
What was the reason that
made these children..

1215
01:25:44,419 --> 01:25:45,784
..go to court against
their parents?

1216
01:25:45,887 --> 01:25:47,582
What is that they want,
come let us ask them.

1217
01:25:48,557 --> 01:25:49,854
We hear that you've..

1218
01:25:49,958 --> 01:25:51,983
..filed case against your
parents. -Yes we have.

1219
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:55,320
You've filed PlL against
the Govt., am I right?

1220
01:25:55,363 --> 01:25:56,728
Yes, you're right,
we have filed.

1221
01:25:56,765 --> 01:25:58,733
What do you want to achieve
by doing this?

1222
01:25:58,834 --> 01:26:00,665
What do you want to
tell our viewers?

1223
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:04,531
Excuse me. -Excuse me.

1224
01:26:16,651 --> 01:26:18,346
Tell us.

1225
01:26:18,453 --> 01:26:21,684
Someone, please tell us.

1226
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:23,323
Tell us.

1227
01:26:23,425 --> 01:26:26,326
Someone, please tell us.

1228
01:26:26,895 --> 01:26:31,264
It's my life; why should
I be scared of someone?

1229
01:26:31,967 --> 01:26:36,666
I love history, then why should
I study mathematics?

1230
01:26:37,305 --> 01:26:42,265
With fear and dying of fear
what will I study?

1231
01:26:42,344 --> 01:26:43,777
Tell us.

1232
01:26:43,879 --> 01:26:47,280
Someone, please tell us.

1233
01:26:47,449 --> 01:26:48,882
Tell us.

1234
01:26:48,984 --> 01:26:52,579
Someone, please tell us.

1235
01:27:18,246 --> 01:27:20,407
What's so great in him?

1236
01:27:20,515 --> 01:27:22,779
What's so great in him?

1237
01:27:22,884 --> 01:27:25,512
Go to the school.

1238
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:27,984
What I want to be.

1239
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:30,724
It's something dear
to my heart.

1240
01:27:30,825 --> 01:27:33,487
Let us do.'

1241
01:27:33,528 --> 01:27:38,488
What I will answer that
I learn by heart.

1242
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:43,603
The age will catch up
with us fast and far.

1243
01:27:43,705 --> 01:27:45,400
Tell us.

1244
01:27:45,507 --> 01:27:48,635
Someone, please tell us.

1245
01:27:48,743 --> 01:27:53,806
Will they come to
wipe my tears?

1246
01:27:53,848 --> 01:27:55,839
Tell us. -Tell us.

1247
01:27:55,951 --> 01:27:59,216
Will someone tell
us? -Tell us.

1248
01:27:59,321 --> 01:28:01,221
Tell us. -Tell us.

1249
01:28:01,289 --> 01:28:03,883
Will someone tell us?

1250
01:28:29,818 --> 01:28:34,585
Do we become a journalist or
do we become an artist?

1251
01:28:34,623 --> 01:28:37,524
Why can I become one?

1252
01:28:37,559 --> 01:28:39,652
Neither doctor or an engineer

1253
01:28:39,761 --> 01:28:44,960
I want to be an actor,
why should I not?

1254
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:50,205
Why has the framer's son come
in a trouser and suit?

1255
01:28:50,205 --> 01:28:54,471
Why is not farming still
in his sentiment?

1256
01:28:55,343 --> 01:29:00,474
Tell us. Someone tell us.

1257
01:29:00,515 --> 01:29:05,509
Why are studies turning into
a challenge these days?

1258
01:29:05,687 --> 01:29:10,215
Tell us. Someone tell us.

1259
01:29:10,725 --> 01:29:15,287
Tell us. Someone tell us.

1260
01:29:15,830 --> 01:29:20,358
It's my life; why should
I be scared of someone?

1261
01:29:20,969 --> 01:29:25,565
I love history, then why should
I study mathematics?

1262
01:29:25,607 --> 01:29:31,011
With fear and dying of fear
what will I study?

1263
01:29:31,279 --> 01:29:35,443
Tell us. Someone tell us.

1264
01:29:36,317 --> 01:29:41,983
Tell us. Someone tell us.

1265
01:29:42,724 --> 01:29:44,658
They want justice and
that too fast.

1266
01:29:44,859 --> 01:29:46,793
Nitesh Dubey, Live
India, Allahabad.

1267
01:29:47,028 --> 01:29:49,394
Do you remember that
Jhunjhunwala? -Yes.

1268
01:29:49,898 --> 01:29:52,799
He has bought a new house.
It's a big house.

1269
01:29:54,202 --> 01:29:56,864
What interiors he has done
up. When I saw it..

1270
01:29:57,639 --> 01:29:59,732
..I never felt like
taking my eyes off.

1271
01:30:00,575 --> 01:30:02,304
He has spent a lot of money.

1272
01:30:03,378 --> 01:30:06,745
His son has completed software
engineering and gone to USA.

1273
01:30:07,849 --> 01:30:09,874
He is earning, and has
sent money from there.

1274
01:30:09,984 --> 01:30:11,451
That's how he has bought
a new house

1275
01:30:11,553 --> 01:30:13,214
Do I keep saying it to Dheeraj
just like that?

1276
01:30:13,321 --> 01:30:15,289
That's why I tell him day and
night to do study engineering.

1277
01:30:15,423 --> 01:30:17,550
That too top in it. You must
be seeing the competition.

1278
01:30:19,494 --> 01:30:21,962
See who it is. -Okay, I'll see.

1279
01:30:26,701 --> 01:30:28,635
Yes. -Mr and Mrs Chopra.

1280
01:30:29,370 --> 01:30:31,804
What is this? -Mr. Jha this
is summons from the court.

1281
01:30:32,474 --> 01:30:33,634
Court summons?! -Yes sir.

1282
01:30:43,284 --> 01:30:47,584
From registrar.. Complainant,
Gaurav Jha?

1283
01:30:49,724 --> 01:30:51,214
Bharat, what is this?

1284
01:30:51,726 --> 01:30:52,750
How will I know?

1285
01:30:52,894 --> 01:30:55,294
Without you knowing how did
summons from court come here?

1286
01:30:56,397 --> 01:30:58,388
Summons from the court?
Who sent it to us?

1287
01:30:58,833 --> 01:31:01,563
And why are you asking
about it to Bharat?

1288
01:31:01,603 --> 01:31:03,366
The summons have been sent
by Bharat's lawyer.

1289
01:31:03,471 --> 01:31:04,563
That's why I'm asking Bharat.

1290
01:31:04,672 --> 01:31:06,196
You still have not grown
a moustache..

1291
01:31:06,274 --> 01:31:08,208
..and you dare to
send us summons?

1292
01:31:08,276 --> 01:31:09,675
You! -Mummy please!

1293
01:31:10,345 --> 01:31:12,245
If you dare harming
me then I'll..

1294
01:31:12,347 --> 01:31:14,338
..have to send you another
summon through my lawyer.

1295
01:31:14,582 --> 01:31:17,745
I'm feeling very hungry
so give me some food.

1296
01:31:18,219 --> 01:31:19,277
Go to hell!

1297
01:31:19,521 --> 01:31:21,819
You will not get any food in
this house, understood?

1298
01:31:21,923 --> 01:31:23,788
One more summon will have
to sent in this respect.

1299
01:31:25,827 --> 01:31:26,987
Come and eat.

1300
01:31:35,436 --> 01:31:36,664
Where is your boss,
lawyer Sanjay?

1301
01:31:37,739 --> 01:31:39,900
Who are all of you? -Forget
that, call him out.

1302
01:31:40,475 --> 01:31:42,443
Sir is inside and.. -You
please call him out.

1303
01:31:42,710 --> 01:31:43,768
I am here.

1304
01:31:44,946 --> 01:31:46,004
Who are all of you?

1305
01:31:46,548 --> 01:31:47,572
Great brother!

1306
01:31:47,949 --> 01:31:49,678
You have made our children
revolt against us..

1307
01:31:49,784 --> 01:31:51,718
..and ask us who we are.

1308
01:31:55,256 --> 01:31:56,621
Come inside. -Come.

1309
01:32:02,630 --> 01:32:03,688
Sit down.

1310
01:32:03,798 --> 01:32:05,959
Look here lawyer sir, we've
not come here to sit.

1311
01:32:06,801 --> 01:32:09,269
Any you're inside the witness
box at the court.

1312
01:32:09,704 --> 01:32:11,001
You've to keep standing.

1313
01:32:11,606 --> 01:32:13,301
It would be better if
you sit down here.

1314
01:32:13,975 --> 01:32:15,636
You withdraw your case.

1315
01:32:16,277 --> 01:32:19,269
We know very well how to bring
up our children. -That's it.

1316
01:32:19,747 --> 01:32:21,908
This you prove in the court.

1317
01:32:22,417 --> 01:32:23,748
Okay.

1318
01:32:25,887 --> 01:32:26,979
Damn it!

1319
01:32:27,889 --> 01:32:29,288
The children of this generation.

1320
01:32:30,825 --> 01:32:32,520
Mr. Ramnath. -Yes sir.

1321
01:32:32,694 --> 01:32:34,286
Who is the lawyer representing
the govt?

1322
01:32:34,329 --> 01:32:35,921
Ms Nandita Prakash. -Good.

1323
01:32:36,531 --> 01:32:39,295
She is having very good reputation
to handle the case smartly.

1324
01:32:39,601 --> 01:32:42,502
Sir, this will not fall under
fundamental rights.

1325
01:32:42,937 --> 01:32:45,667
This will fall under directive
principles, so..

1326
01:32:45,807 --> 01:32:47,866
..there is no need
for us to worry.

1327
01:32:48,776 --> 01:32:50,937
But sir, Sanjay is a
very smart lawyer.

1328
01:32:51,446 --> 01:32:54,347
They way he argues
social issues..

1329
01:32:54,649 --> 01:32:56,514
..the adversaries are not in a
position to think anything.

1330
01:32:57,018 --> 01:32:58,645
They have no option but
to agree with him.

1331
01:32:58,953 --> 01:33:02,855
You're right. We can't take
this case so lightly.

1332
01:33:04,792 --> 01:33:05,918
Sir, excuse me.

1333
01:33:10,632 --> 01:33:11,963
Excuse me.

1334
01:33:15,036 --> 01:33:16,435
Put the TV on.

1335
01:33:17,872 --> 01:33:19,669
This news has been on
the top in the news..

1336
01:33:19,774 --> 01:33:22,004
..bulletin from the morning.
As we had informed you..

1337
01:33:22,277 --> 01:33:23,835
The moment the court opened
in the morning..

1338
01:33:23,945 --> 01:33:26,038
..a lot of children started
filing cases.

1339
01:33:26,581 --> 01:33:28,515
In different parts of the
country all put together..

1340
01:33:28,616 --> 01:33:30,345
..9001 cases have been filed.

1341
01:33:30,451 --> 01:33:32,681
According to estimates made by
our team by the evening..

1342
01:33:32,787 --> 01:33:35,449
..more than 20,000 cases are
expected to be filed.

1343
01:33:35,556 --> 01:33:39,287
The news bulletin on the matter
will broadcast at 2,4,6 and 8..

1344
01:33:39,327 --> 01:33:42,922
..and at 10 in the night experts
will examine this issue..

1345
01:33:42,964 --> 01:33:45,558
Sir, there is an important
call from the PMs office.

1346
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:47,395
A special cabinet meeting
has been called.

1347
01:33:47,735 --> 01:33:51,796
Okay. All of you should prepare
the papers by the evening.

1348
01:33:51,839 --> 01:33:53,864
Okay? -Yes sir. -Yes
sir. -Sure sir.

1349
01:33:55,576 --> 01:33:58,306
Okay have all of you seen
the news? -Yes sir.

1350
01:33:58,579 --> 01:33:59,807
What do you feel?

1351
01:34:00,281 --> 01:34:02,272
Legally, we have
a chance to win.

1352
01:34:02,417 --> 01:34:04,647
I had told that this
case we will win.

1353
01:34:04,852 --> 01:34:07,844
But in spite of winning
the case..

1354
01:34:08,756 --> 01:34:11,725
..we will lose the respect
and faith of the public.

1355
01:34:12,493 --> 01:34:13,619
Meaning..

1356
01:34:13,962 --> 01:34:15,793
..we will lose even after
winning. -Sir.

1357
01:34:16,664 --> 01:34:18,757
Actually people welfare is the
government's responsibility.

1358
01:34:18,866 --> 01:34:19,890
Of course.

1359
01:34:19,934 --> 01:34:22,266
Sanjay will surely bring up
this point in the court.

1360
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:24,895
And because of this point
the pubilc will feel..

1361
01:34:25,039 --> 01:34:26,973
..that we are not thinking about
the welfare of the public.

1362
01:34:27,275 --> 01:34:29,937
We will tell the opposition
camp has instigated Sanjay.

1363
01:34:30,445 --> 01:34:33,346
He always does like
this. -My god!

1364
01:34:34,015 --> 01:34:36,449
You will tell this
to the media and..

1365
01:34:36,551 --> 01:34:39,850
..spoil the image of
our govt? Look..

1366
01:34:40,788 --> 01:34:42,847
Tell the party president..

1367
01:34:43,458 --> 01:34:45,050
..that from our party..

1368
01:34:45,793 --> 01:34:48,387
..no one will speak to the
media on this matter.

1369
01:34:48,563 --> 01:34:52,499
But, if the media personnel ask
us what will we tell them?

1370
01:34:52,667 --> 01:34:53,827
We will tell that..

1371
01:34:54,369 --> 01:34:57,338
..as long as the matter is in
court we'll not say anything.

1372
01:34:57,438 --> 01:34:59,463
We believe in the
justice of court.

1373
01:34:59,507 --> 01:35:00,633
That's it. -Certainly.

1374
01:35:01,509 --> 01:35:03,534
In the case of the children
vs Govt. and parents..

1375
01:35:03,578 --> 01:35:06,308
..there have been more cases
filed that we estimated.

1376
01:35:06,447 --> 01:35:09,814
Out of this 30165 cases against
the government..

1377
01:35:10,251 --> 01:35:13,880
..and 3817 4 cases against the
parents have been filed.

1378
01:35:14,322 --> 01:35:15,619
There is a possibility
of more petitions..

1379
01:35:15,723 --> 01:35:17,247
..being filed in
the coming days.

1380
01:35:17,725 --> 01:35:21,252
In a country where a case
is heard for 14 years..

1381
01:35:21,562 --> 01:35:23,860
..in that rate for so many
cases to be heard..

1382
01:35:23,965 --> 01:35:26,559
..thousands of courts will need
thousands of hours to hear it.

1383
01:35:26,734 --> 01:35:29,635
Already there are many cases
pending in our courts.

1384
01:35:29,670 --> 01:35:31,968
We need to see how our courts..

1385
01:35:32,273 --> 01:35:34,468
..will save themselves from the

1386
01:35:34,575 --> 01:35:38,841
Now for some sports news.
Spain has beat Germany..

1387
01:35:38,980 --> 01:35:42,507
..and won the Euro cup. With
this the people in Spain..

1388
01:35:42,550 --> 01:35:45,348
..are in a wave of happiness
and joy and show this joy..

1389
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:46,509
..they were seen on the
streets. -Hello.

1390
01:35:46,554 --> 01:35:48,579
Have you gone mad seeing
those boys?

1391
01:35:48,956 --> 01:35:51,254
I fail top understand. He
wants to do farming now.

1392
01:35:51,592 --> 01:35:53,753
How many times have I explained
to you son that there is not..

1393
01:35:53,861 --> 01:35:55,988
..enough money in farming for
the labour you put in.

1394
01:35:56,631 --> 01:35:58,462
Se your uncle yourself.

1395
01:35:58,566 --> 01:36:00,659
He has done engineering
and happy with a job.

1396
01:36:01,369 --> 01:36:03,360
How happy his life
is pulling along.

1397
01:36:03,571 --> 01:36:04,833
Papa, why don't you make
him understand?

1398
01:36:05,006 --> 01:36:08,965
Papa, if everyone goes for
a job who will do farming?

1399
01:36:09,510 --> 01:36:12,240
Anyway, I love farming.

1400
01:36:12,947 --> 01:36:15,643
If no one does farming then how
will there be food to eat?

1401
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:18,318
Will you import it from outside?

1402
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:20,487
First we were uneducated.

1403
01:36:20,755 --> 01:36:22,723
We used to borrow money
from money lenders..

1404
01:36:22,824 --> 01:36:24,815
..on high interest rates
and destroy ourselves.

1405
01:36:25,026 --> 01:36:27,654
Now in spite of being educated..

1406
01:36:27,862 --> 01:36:29,921
..we still borrow money with
interest from foriegn countries.

1407
01:36:30,331 --> 01:36:33,459
We and our govt. are dancing
to their tunes.

1408
01:36:43,277 --> 01:36:45,837
There is some good news sir.
From different parts..

1409
01:36:45,947 --> 01:36:48,313
..of India 95 Psychiatrists
have called you up.

1410
01:36:48,416 --> 01:36:51,283
I have noted their contact
numbers and..

1411
01:36:51,319 --> 01:36:52,547
..some of them want
to meet you too.

1412
01:36:52,587 --> 01:36:55,613
Oh! That's very good.
Call them in.

1413
01:36:55,656 --> 01:36:58,853
Yes sir. -Oh! Sent some tea
too. -Okay sir. -Thanks.

1414
01:37:05,466 --> 01:37:07,331
Hello. I'm.. -Hello.

1415
01:37:07,602 --> 01:37:10,230
Rajesh Srivastav. -Hi! -
My fellow Psychiatrist..

1416
01:37:10,571 --> 01:37:12,698
..Rishi Kapadia. -I'm
Satish Kar. -Hi!

1417
01:37:13,241 --> 01:37:14,708
Sit down please. -Thank you.

1418
01:37:16,410 --> 01:37:17,468
Mr. Sanjay..

1419
01:37:18,813 --> 01:37:21,543
..we are following the developments
in Navneet suicide case.

1420
01:37:22,984 --> 01:37:24,542
Wer also know that..

1421
01:37:25,486 --> 01:37:27,613
..a lot of children are
facing this problem.

1422
01:37:29,891 --> 01:37:32,519
We want to help you in
any way possible.

1423
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:36,924
Look, for expert opinion in
the court I need witnesses.

1424
01:37:37,598 --> 01:37:40,362
Yes, we can and will
surely testify.

1425
01:37:41,269 --> 01:37:42,293
Thank you.

1426
01:37:43,571 --> 01:37:45,664
Bye. -Thank you. -Thank you.

1427
01:37:46,841 --> 01:37:49,401
For the hearing of this
sensational case..

1428
01:37:49,510 --> 01:37:52,536
..the chief justice of India has
appointed a special bench.

1429
01:37:52,647 --> 01:37:54,979
Now all the cases have been
transferred to Supreme court.

1430
01:37:55,249 --> 01:37:56,682
Why was this done?

1431
01:37:56,784 --> 01:37:59,776
Come let us ask our colleague
Karad who is now..

1432
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:03,415
..with Mr. SR Sharma, the
chief justice of India.

1433
01:38:03,558 --> 01:38:04,820
Mr Subir now I am at
the residence..

1434
01:38:04,926 --> 01:38:07,690
..of chief justice of India
and as you already know..

1435
01:38:07,795 --> 01:38:11,629
..the children vs Govt., parents
has created a great storm.

1436
01:38:11,666 --> 01:38:15,227
To the extent that it has shaken
the parliament too.

1437
01:38:15,269 --> 01:38:17,430
That is why for the first
time in history..

1438
01:38:17,538 --> 01:38:19,768
..the chief justice of India
is addressing the media.

1439
01:38:19,874 --> 01:38:21,774
Sir, regarding this matter
what have you got to say?

1440
01:38:22,376 --> 01:38:24,571
Look, from every corner
in India till now..

1441
01:38:24,845 --> 01:38:27,575
..1,90,000 petitions against
the parents..

1442
01:38:27,949 --> 01:38:29,849
..and against Govt. of India..

1443
01:38:30,284 --> 01:38:34,015
..1,09,000 PlL petitions
have been filed.

1444
01:38:34,655 --> 01:38:36,589
This is a record in the
history of India.

1445
01:38:37,291 --> 01:38:40,021
Till now on any issue..

1446
01:38:40,595 --> 01:38:42,893
..not only in India but even
in the entire world..

1447
01:38:42,997 --> 01:38:45,329
..so many petitions have
never been filed.

1448
01:38:45,866 --> 01:38:48,664
In all these petitions
the real issue is one.

1449
01:38:49,337 --> 01:38:50,895
They are both interrelated too.

1450
01:38:51,706 --> 01:38:54,766
This is to save the time
of the courts and..

1451
01:38:54,909 --> 01:38:56,774
..to give justice to the
children at the earliest..

1452
01:38:56,877 --> 01:38:58,504
..we had to take this step.

1453
01:38:58,813 --> 01:39:01,441
Sir, tell us why did you chose..

1454
01:39:01,549 --> 01:39:03,710
..Justice Bharat Kumar
for the special bench?

1455
01:39:04,452 --> 01:39:07,319
Look, to handle both the cases..

1456
01:39:07,888 --> 01:39:10,220
..it is important to understand
both the generations well.

1457
01:39:10,891 --> 01:39:13,985
A judge like Bharat Kumar has
the experience for this.

1458
01:39:14,562 --> 01:39:16,996
You rightly said sir. Justice
Bharat Kumar has given..

1459
01:39:17,265 --> 01:39:18,926
..many landmark judgments
earlier.

1460
01:39:19,233 --> 01:39:21,326
Before we finish I have a
last question to you sir.

1461
01:39:21,736 --> 01:39:24,227
Did you chose law by
your own choice..

1462
01:39:24,305 --> 01:39:25,704
..or was it your
parents' choice?

1463
01:39:25,806 --> 01:39:27,865
Good question.

1464
01:39:28,342 --> 01:39:30,003
But no comments.

1465
01:39:31,012 --> 01:39:33,742
That was chief justice of
India Mr. SR Sharma..

1466
01:39:33,848 --> 01:39:36,373
..who has promised speedy
justice for the children.

1467
01:39:36,784 --> 01:39:39,844
With cameraman Abhishek, Parag
Shapekar Live India, Delhi.

1468
01:39:42,990 --> 01:39:44,981
Sir, Gaurav's mother
wants to meet you.

1469
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:47,418
Okay sir.

1470
01:39:49,697 --> 01:39:51,631
You can go inside madam.
Thank you.

1471
01:39:53,367 --> 01:39:55,733
My son Gaurav and you..

1472
01:39:57,238 --> 01:39:58,933
..both of you are
misunderstanding my husband.

1473
01:40:00,341 --> 01:40:03,208
He is after all a child but
you're grown up and still..

1474
01:40:03,444 --> 01:40:04,968
..doing such a wrong thing.

1475
01:40:09,617 --> 01:40:13,849
Look, my husband works very
hard to earn a living.

1476
01:40:15,623 --> 01:40:19,525
He has never done anything
for himself.

1477
01:40:20,361 --> 01:40:21,726
He has always everything
for his son.

1478
01:40:21,962 --> 01:40:23,486
He has always thought
only about him.

1479
01:40:24,332 --> 01:40:25,594
And to such a man..

1480
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:28,700
..a court summon has been sent,
what justice is this?

1481
01:40:30,004 --> 01:40:31,301
Anything else?

1482
01:40:34,909 --> 01:40:37,639
That our child studies well
and gets a good job..

1483
01:40:38,346 --> 01:40:41,975
..that he prospers well, is it
a crime to think like that?

1484
01:40:42,917 --> 01:40:43,906
No.

1485
01:40:44,819 --> 01:40:46,753
Then why this summon
from the court?

1486
01:40:49,390 --> 01:40:53,190
You ask your husband to meet me.

1487
01:40:54,395 --> 01:40:55,623
Okay.

1488
01:41:01,635 --> 01:41:03,466
What a worthless boy we
have given birth to.

1489
01:41:04,238 --> 01:41:07,503
I have been asking you to take
ItA and take us to Delhi.

1490
01:41:07,908 --> 01:41:10,775
We are going to Delhi
but to fight a case.

1491
01:41:11,445 --> 01:41:13,845
Fun! We are going to
Delhi. -Shut up!

1492
01:41:14,615 --> 01:41:15,639
Shut up and sit down.

1493
01:41:38,672 --> 01:41:40,663
Children vs parents and
Govt, the points in..

1494
01:41:40,775 --> 01:41:43,505
..all the petitions will
be heard in this court.

1495
01:41:44,745 --> 01:41:47,236
That's why chief justice
of India..

1496
01:41:47,481 --> 01:41:50,541
..has appointed me in this
bench. All of you know..

1497
01:41:51,652 --> 01:41:54,678
..that the Navneet suicide case
will also be heard here.

1498
01:41:55,256 --> 01:41:56,382
The proceedings may start.

1499
01:41:59,827 --> 01:42:02,489
My lord. The children these
days are facing..

1500
01:42:02,596 --> 01:42:04,257
..a lot of pressure
of studies on them.

1501
01:42:04,598 --> 01:42:07,260
In most cases between class
lX to class Xll.

1502
01:42:07,768 --> 01:42:09,360
The interesting fact is that..

1503
01:42:09,870 --> 01:42:11,770
..before the children get the
knowledge from the books..

1504
01:42:11,872 --> 01:42:13,669
..the parents decide..

1505
01:42:13,774 --> 01:42:16,607
..what they should do and
what they'll do in life.

1506
01:42:16,977 --> 01:42:19,002
To understand this
issue better..

1507
01:42:19,346 --> 01:42:21,644
..we are fighting this case.
Thank you, my lord.

1508
01:42:24,018 --> 01:42:25,280
My lord.

1509
01:42:26,587 --> 01:42:29,556
It's an unfortunate day in
the history of india.

1510
01:42:30,925 --> 01:42:33,416
The country where parents
are worshipped..

1511
01:42:34,395 --> 01:42:35,794
..where a son like
Shravan Kumar..

1512
01:42:36,397 --> 01:42:39,059
..thought his duty was to
serve his blind parents.

1513
01:42:40,301 --> 01:42:42,565
Where Ram to keep up the
promise of his parents..

1514
01:42:42,870 --> 01:42:44,929
..went on exile for 14
years in the jungle.

1515
01:42:45,573 --> 01:42:47,871
Where Bhishma for the sake
of his father's marriage..

1516
01:42:47,975 --> 01:42:49,772
..maintained celibacy throughout
his entire life.

1517
01:42:50,277 --> 01:42:51,301
In that country today..

1518
01:42:51,946 --> 01:42:55,746
.. a child on India is fighting
a case against his parents.

1519
01:42:55,783 --> 01:42:56,875
My lord.

1520
01:42:58,452 --> 01:43:02,445
If our learned lawyer has
touched upon history..

1521
01:43:03,023 --> 01:43:04,490
..then I would also like
to say something.

1522
01:43:05,426 --> 01:43:07,917
In Mahabharat., among
the 5 Pandavs..

1523
01:43:08,562 --> 01:43:11,759
..Bhim mastered using the mace
and Arjun the bow and arrow.

1524
01:43:12,333 --> 01:43:15,268
Nakul and Sahadev had
mastered fencing.

1525
01:43:15,769 --> 01:43:18,329
That means that in ancient
times too..

1526
01:43:18,772 --> 01:43:21,935
..they learnt what
they liked most.

1527
01:43:22,543 --> 01:43:24,670
But today the parents
are pushing..

1528
01:43:24,778 --> 01:43:26,268
..their choice on the children.

1529
01:43:27,848 --> 01:43:30,783
I want to say something to you
as well as all the parents..

1530
01:43:31,018 --> 01:43:32,918
..that the children are not
against their parents.

1531
01:43:33,554 --> 01:43:35,419
They are against their thoughts.

1532
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:39,452
My lord, here are some bills.

1533
01:43:41,028 --> 01:43:43,519
This is the bill of children
college fees and books..

1534
01:43:43,898 --> 01:43:46,332
..and these are the bills for
extra coaching classes and..

1535
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,859
..these are for their clothes
and roaming around and..

1536
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:51,228
..for their pocket money.

1537
01:43:52,273 --> 01:43:55,572
How can the children file a
case against such parents?

1538
01:43:57,378 --> 01:43:58,743
How can they file a case?

1539
01:43:59,647 --> 01:44:01,945
Seems that my friend
has forgotten.

1540
01:44:03,250 --> 01:44:06,845
Never mind, I'll teach after
the court is over.

1541
01:44:07,821 --> 01:44:11,552
In the matter of bills you seem
to have forgotten one bill.

1542
01:44:11,859 --> 01:44:13,986
What bill? -Your bill.

1543
01:44:14,728 --> 01:44:15,956
You take fees for
fighting a case.

1544
01:44:16,463 --> 01:44:19,261
Can you assure them that
you'll win the case?

1545
01:44:20,467 --> 01:44:21,957
What nonsense are you talking?

1546
01:44:22,303 --> 01:44:23,998
There is no relation between
these matters and the case.

1547
01:44:24,271 --> 01:44:26,671
There is a connection, my lord.
There is a connection.

1548
01:44:27,775 --> 01:44:30,573
Lawyer takes fees for
fighting a case.

1549
01:44:30,911 --> 01:44:32,640
If he loses then what?

1550
01:44:33,347 --> 01:44:34,780
Like that the parents
sent their children..

1551
01:44:35,516 --> 01:44:36,710
..to school for studies.

1552
01:44:36,817 --> 01:44:38,284
The child on its
part works hard.

1553
01:44:38,385 --> 01:44:40,444
Gets 4th, 7th or 10th rank.

1554
01:44:40,554 --> 01:44:43,751
But he gets punished for
not getting 1st rank.

1555
01:44:43,857 --> 01:44:45,290
How is that justified?

1556
01:44:46,794 --> 01:44:48,819
My lord, I wish to
call my youngest..

1557
01:44:48,929 --> 01:44:51,227
..client and witness, Chutki.

1558
01:44:51,532 --> 01:44:52,590
Permission granted.

1559
01:44:53,267 --> 01:44:54,632
Chutki.

1560
01:44:58,238 --> 01:44:59,398
Dear, what is your name?

1561
01:44:59,573 --> 01:45:01,541
Chutki. -Chutki.

1562
01:45:01,742 --> 01:45:03,937
In the house my parents,
my brother and..

1563
01:45:03,978 --> 01:45:08,813
..my uncles and aunts
all call me Chutki.

1564
01:45:08,849 --> 01:45:10,817
In the school? -Dharni.

1565
01:45:11,018 --> 01:45:12,451
Which class are you in?

1566
01:45:13,354 --> 01:45:14,548
Second class.

1567
01:45:15,823 --> 01:45:17,415
Do you like studies?

1568
01:45:17,558 --> 01:45:22,257
I like it. In English and math
I stood first in the class.

1569
01:45:23,364 --> 01:45:27,528
But in ES, Gk and Hindi I don't
rank first in the class.

1570
01:45:28,802 --> 01:45:29,928
You can ask the questions.

1571
01:45:32,272 --> 01:45:35,366
Do you always want
to come first?

1572
01:45:35,509 --> 01:45:36,567
No.

1573
01:45:37,277 --> 01:45:38,471
That mummy wants.

1574
01:45:38,746 --> 01:45:41,772
If I don't come first
mummy gets angry.

1575
01:45:42,516 --> 01:45:45,007
Oh! -And your papa?

1576
01:45:45,052 --> 01:45:46,280
Papa too.

1577
01:45:47,588 --> 01:45:52,821
My lord I wish to call Chutki's
parents to the witness box.

1578
01:45:52,860 --> 01:45:54,350
Permission granted.

1579
01:45:55,362 --> 01:45:57,694
My lord, I also wish to ask some
questions to this child.

1580
01:45:57,998 --> 01:45:59,363
She is not a grown up child.

1581
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,230
You can cross examine
the elder children.

1582
01:46:02,569 --> 01:46:04,400
Still in the end if want
you can call her.

1583
01:46:04,438 --> 01:46:05,666
yes, my lord.

1584
01:46:05,773 --> 01:46:07,331
Mr and Mrs Pandey.

1585
01:46:07,374 --> 01:46:10,969
Mr. Prabhakar, are you the
head of your company?

1586
01:46:13,514 --> 01:46:14,606
No.

1587
01:46:15,249 --> 01:46:16,546
Your designation.

1588
01:46:17,351 --> 01:46:18,648
Assistant manager.

1589
01:46:19,687 --> 01:46:23,714
What is the topmost designation
in your company and..

1590
01:46:23,891 --> 01:46:26,758
..will you reach that position
before you retire?

1591
01:46:26,927 --> 01:46:27,951
Objection my lord.

1592
01:46:28,595 --> 01:46:30,256
This question has no relevance
to this case.

1593
01:46:30,330 --> 01:46:32,730
My lord this is an important
question.

1594
01:46:33,333 --> 01:46:36,598
I will prove that
it has relevance.

1595
01:46:37,371 --> 01:46:39,965
Objection over ruled.
Answer this question.

1596
01:46:42,710 --> 01:46:44,473
The highest position is
that of a director.

1597
01:46:45,012 --> 01:46:48,345
I can at best become
a Sr. Manager.

1598
01:46:49,717 --> 01:46:51,651
Does your wife know that?

1599
01:46:53,253 --> 01:46:54,481
Yes, she knows.

1600
01:46:55,489 --> 01:46:56,683
Tell me something.

1601
01:46:57,291 --> 01:46:59,384
Your wife, whether in
the role of a wife..

1602
01:46:59,493 --> 01:47:01,222
..or in the role of a mother
or as a good cook.

1603
01:47:01,328 --> 01:47:02,454
Which is she best in?

1604
01:47:07,868 --> 01:47:09,267
She is average in everything.

1605
01:47:10,537 --> 01:47:14,268
Great! You're average,
your wife is average..

1606
01:47:14,842 --> 01:47:18,835
..the child in the class between
1 and 5 above average.

1607
01:47:20,848 --> 01:47:22,475
If she doesn't come first..

1608
01:47:22,816 --> 01:47:24,545
..punishing her,
is it justified?

1609
01:47:25,953 --> 01:47:27,545
Order. Order.

1610
01:47:27,588 --> 01:47:28,748
Madam.

1611
01:47:31,959 --> 01:47:35,417
Madam, at least you tell us..

1612
01:47:36,630 --> 01:47:37,961
Since we couldn't so..

1613
01:47:39,366 --> 01:47:41,527
..we expect that our children
stand first.

1614
01:47:44,872 --> 01:47:46,396
Please note this point, my lord.

1615
01:47:47,274 --> 01:47:50,402
I want to call Mr &
Mrs Ketan Chopra.

1616
01:47:50,911 --> 01:47:52,572
My lord, in this particular
case..

1617
01:47:52,679 --> 01:47:54,442
..I wish to first call Dheeraj
to the witness box.

1618
01:47:54,548 --> 01:47:55,446
Permission granted.

1619
01:47:57,885 --> 01:47:59,546
Dheeraj, while filing the case
against your parents..

1620
01:47:59,653 --> 01:48:01,678
..the reason you've
written is that..

1621
01:48:02,322 --> 01:48:04,222
..your parents compare you to
their friend's children..

1622
01:48:04,291 --> 01:48:06,316
..and pressurise you.

1623
01:48:07,227 --> 01:48:09,661
The things that your friends
have, you also want them..

1624
01:48:10,330 --> 01:48:12,230
..have you ever insisted
so with your parents?

1625
01:48:12,366 --> 01:48:14,493
I did but.. -Answer
in yes or no.

1626
01:48:15,235 --> 01:48:17,567
Don't answer questions
that I didn't ask you.

1627
01:48:17,604 --> 01:48:18,764
Sir.

1628
01:48:18,872 --> 01:48:20,362
I want to say something to you.

1629
01:48:21,241 --> 01:48:22,265
Tell me.

1630
01:48:22,309 --> 01:48:24,539
My parents wanted to
buy a bike for me.

1631
01:48:24,745 --> 01:48:26,337
All my friends have cycles.

1632
01:48:26,547 --> 01:48:29,243
If I had a bike then l
can't move with them.

1633
01:48:29,550 --> 01:48:32,383
That's why I didn't ask for
anything that they can't get me.

1634
01:48:32,419 --> 01:48:34,512
Ask them, did I ask
for Mercedes Benz?

1635
01:48:37,024 --> 01:48:38,252
Order. Order.

1636
01:48:39,459 --> 01:48:42,451
Tell me Dheeraj, how many
hours do you study?

1637
01:48:42,930 --> 01:48:45,694
Sir, I study between
5 and 6 at home.

1638
01:48:46,266 --> 01:48:47,631
From 7 to 2l attend college
and after that..

1639
01:48:48,368 --> 01:48:51,462
..I come home and have lunch and
then 3 to6 coaching classes.

1640
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:55,538
After that in the night, dinner
at 9 and then 10 to 11..

1641
01:48:55,709 --> 01:48:56,971
..I do my home work and sleep.

1642
01:48:57,411 --> 01:48:58,469
Okay.

1643
01:48:59,213 --> 01:49:01,909
Tell me in detail what you
do between 7 to 10.

1644
01:49:02,216 --> 01:49:04,241
Sir, from 7 to 8.30 I'm
with my friends.

1645
01:49:04,852 --> 01:49:05,910
After that I come
home and then..

1646
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:07,585
..computer games and
songs, that's all.

1647
01:49:07,888 --> 01:49:08,912
Okay.

1648
01:49:09,590 --> 01:49:10,989
You roam around with
your friends..

1649
01:49:11,425 --> 01:49:13,552
..play computer games
and listen to songs..

1650
01:49:14,895 --> 01:49:17,864
Basically you waste
your valuable time.

1651
01:49:18,298 --> 01:49:19,731
Sir, this is our age to
play and have fun.

1652
01:49:19,833 --> 01:49:22,597
If I spent some time with
my friends, what's wrong?

1653
01:49:24,404 --> 01:49:25,496
Court is adjourned.

1654
01:49:25,606 --> 01:49:26,800
The rest of the proceedings
will continue tomorrow.

1655
01:49:28,809 --> 01:49:30,606
You were great today.

1656
01:49:30,777 --> 01:49:33,769
You made the defense
lawyer speechless.

1657
01:49:33,914 --> 01:49:36,246
Brother was I not good?

1658
01:49:36,283 --> 01:49:38,308
You're our heroine.

1659
01:49:38,919 --> 01:49:41,319
Uncle will we win?

1660
01:49:41,521 --> 01:49:43,580
When there are so many
people with us..

1661
01:49:44,324 --> 01:49:47,657
..then we must surely win.

1662
01:49:48,195 --> 01:49:49,287
Come.

1663
01:49:49,863 --> 01:49:50,955
What do you feel?

1664
01:49:51,231 --> 01:49:53,699
After this case the children
will not respect their parents?

1665
01:49:54,201 --> 01:49:55,930
No, I don't feel so.

1666
01:49:56,637 --> 01:49:58,468
I feel that because of this
case the relationship..

1667
01:49:58,572 --> 01:50:00,802
..of the child and the parents
will become stronger.

1668
01:50:01,208 --> 01:50:04,803
We borrow money and get our children
educated in big schools.

1669
01:50:05,612 --> 01:50:07,910
These useless ones are filing
case against us.

1670
01:50:08,415 --> 01:50:09,848
We pay the EMl against
the loan regularly.

1671
01:50:10,217 --> 01:50:11,741
But I feel we should
spend some..

1672
01:50:11,852 --> 01:50:13,717
..installments of our
time on our children.

1673
01:50:14,955 --> 01:50:16,980
Mr. Sanjay as you told us..

1674
01:50:17,357 --> 01:50:20,417
..the objective of
both the cases..

1675
01:50:20,527 --> 01:50:22,552
..children vs parents, children
vs govt. are inter related.

1676
01:50:23,297 --> 01:50:26,232
Hence we shall discuss children
vs government today.

1677
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:27,792
Ys my lord.

1678
01:50:28,568 --> 01:50:31,833
Ms Nandita you must also have
been briefed about this.

1679
01:50:32,239 --> 01:50:33,433
Yes my lord.

1680
01:50:33,807 --> 01:50:35,240
Start the proceedings.

1681
01:50:35,976 --> 01:50:38,774
My lord, PlL is only..

1682
01:50:38,812 --> 01:50:41,303
..for fundamental rights and..

1683
01:50:41,581 --> 01:50:42,673
..this case..

1684
01:50:43,283 --> 01:50:44,716
..is not covered by
fundamental rights.

1685
01:50:44,751 --> 01:50:45,775
My lord.

1686
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:47,682
Under article 45..

1687
01:50:47,854 --> 01:50:50,687
..women and children come under
directive principle.

1688
01:50:51,658 --> 01:50:54,183
In the case of RA Ravi similar
PlL was filed..

1689
01:50:54,361 --> 01:50:57,296
..and the supreme court gave a
ruling on that. I request..

1690
01:50:57,664 --> 01:51:00,292
..that this case also should
be treated in the same way.

1691
01:51:00,534 --> 01:51:01,694
Permission granted.

1692
01:51:01,969 --> 01:51:03,266
Thank you my lord.

1693
01:51:04,571 --> 01:51:07,199
My lord, if the parents put
the pressure of education..

1694
01:51:07,274 --> 01:51:08,969
..on their children
then that's their..

1695
01:51:09,810 --> 01:51:11,209
..it is their family
matter. Their..

1696
01:51:11,445 --> 01:51:13,379
This is a personal
matter and hence..

1697
01:51:13,613 --> 01:51:15,547
..the government cant interfere.

1698
01:51:15,716 --> 01:51:16,876
Milord.

1699
01:51:17,951 --> 01:51:20,886
Some parents have child-marriage
done.

1700
01:51:21,488 --> 01:51:22,716
I know that..

1701
01:51:22,956 --> 01:51:25,891
..whatever parents do, it is
for their children's good.

1702
01:51:26,226 --> 01:51:29,252
If child-marriage is done
for the child's good..

1703
01:51:30,230 --> 01:51:31,857
..will we support them?

1704
01:51:32,566 --> 01:51:35,933
I object Milord. Child-marriage
is illegal.

1705
01:51:36,236 --> 01:51:37,601
Who made that law?

1706
01:51:38,505 --> 01:51:39,699
The government did.

1707
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:43,407
As you said child-marriage..

1708
01:51:43,777 --> 01:51:45,904
..is their personal
matter for them.

1709
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:49,240
Why is the government
intruding then?

1710
01:51:50,384 --> 01:51:53,512
Milord, we all know that child
marriage is a social crime..

1711
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:56,521
..and blocks progress
and hence..

1712
01:51:56,790 --> 01:51:58,849
That is why the government
has stopped it.

1713
01:51:58,959 --> 01:52:02,395
Please! Please note this point,
Milord. Please note this point.

1714
01:52:04,898 --> 01:52:08,493
Milord, is advocate Sanjay
trying to say that..

1715
01:52:08,835 --> 01:52:12,566
..giving parental guidance to
children to make a better..

1716
01:52:12,973 --> 01:52:14,304
..future is a social evil?

1717
01:52:14,674 --> 01:52:16,904
Therefore the government needs
to step in and take a stand?

1718
01:52:17,878 --> 01:52:20,005
Well, I would think not.

1719
01:52:20,981 --> 01:52:23,313
Milord, it is a well
established law..

1720
01:52:23,450 --> 01:52:25,782
..that children till the time
they remain minors..

1721
01:52:25,986 --> 01:52:28,887
..need the care and protection
of a parent or a guardian.

1722
01:52:29,489 --> 01:52:32,014
On the very basic premise that
they are not capable of..

1723
01:52:32,292 --> 01:52:34,556
..making sound decisions.

1724
01:52:36,530 --> 01:52:38,998
I think advocate Sanjay
is trying to overturn..

1725
01:52:39,299 --> 01:52:40,960
..this fundamental
tenate of law.

1726
01:52:41,368 --> 01:52:44,462
Milord, she is absolutely right.

1727
01:52:45,605 --> 01:52:47,596
Parents and guardians
must show the path.

1728
01:52:48,241 --> 01:52:49,469
This is not the way!

1729
01:52:49,943 --> 01:52:51,604
Its forcing and pressurizing.

1730
01:52:52,279 --> 01:52:53,803
To prove this..

1731
01:52:54,414 --> 01:52:58,612
..I would like to call Dr.Rajesh
Shrivastav to the witness box.

1732
01:52:58,819 --> 01:53:00,013
Permission granted.

1733
01:53:01,721 --> 01:53:05,248
Doctor, you are a child
psychiatrist.

1734
01:53:05,358 --> 01:53:06,382
That's right, sir.

1735
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:09,256
For the record, I am a child
psychiatrist, Dr. Shrivastav.

1736
01:53:10,330 --> 01:53:12,457
Tell me, these days..

1737
01:53:12,799 --> 01:53:14,858
..how parents treat their
children these days.

1738
01:53:15,035 --> 01:53:18,471
Today's parents dont understand
their children's problems.

1739
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:21,705
Some parents..

1740
01:53:22,776 --> 01:53:25,506
..just talk to kids about
their school..

1741
01:53:26,446 --> 01:53:28,880
..studies, examination or..

1742
01:53:29,716 --> 01:53:31,843
..or the marks derived
from them.

1743
01:53:32,886 --> 01:53:34,649
They think that..

1744
01:53:34,955 --> 01:53:37,685
..getting a laptop for them..

1745
01:53:38,291 --> 01:53:39,758
..or buying them expensive
books..

1746
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:43,495
..would end their responsibility.
Well, that is wrong.

1747
01:53:43,864 --> 01:53:45,593
I think that..

1748
01:53:46,333 --> 01:53:48,233
..parents should..

1749
01:53:48,568 --> 01:53:50,866
..communicate well
with their kids.

1750
01:53:51,705 --> 01:53:54,970
Taking some time off thier
busy lives everyday..

1751
01:53:55,942 --> 01:53:59,776
..they must talk to thier kids
and understand their problems.

1752
01:54:00,247 --> 01:54:01,509
In fact, I..

1753
01:54:01,948 --> 01:54:05,543
..would like to warn
parents that..

1754
01:54:07,854 --> 01:54:11,381
..threatening or scaring
them with consequences..

1755
01:54:11,658 --> 01:54:16,618
..such as failure and such
likes. Creating such fear..

1756
01:54:17,497 --> 01:54:20,523
..that if they dont beat
the competetion..

1757
01:54:20,901 --> 01:54:22,027
..their future is very..

1758
01:54:23,537 --> 01:54:25,971
..will be dark. All this..

1759
01:54:26,606 --> 01:54:28,597
..into kids' minds,
their brains..

1760
01:54:28,875 --> 01:54:33,676
..it creates stress hormones.
Their emotional balance..

1761
01:54:33,813 --> 01:54:36,338
Their emotional balance
goes haywire.

1762
01:54:36,616 --> 01:54:39,414
So, parents have to be
extremely careful.

1763
01:54:40,687 --> 01:54:44,316
You think this kids rebellion
is right or wrong?

1764
01:54:44,524 --> 01:54:46,924
Objection Milord. This
is a leading question.

1765
01:54:48,662 --> 01:54:49,686
Sorry.

1766
01:54:50,530 --> 01:54:53,226
I withdraw my question.
Your witness.

1767
01:54:53,366 --> 01:54:54,390
Thank you.

1768
01:54:57,003 --> 01:54:58,368
Dr. Shrivastav..

1769
01:54:59,806 --> 01:55:01,467
Do you believe that..

1770
01:55:01,741 --> 01:55:05,939
..all kids are decent like a
holy boy and all parents..

1771
01:55:06,479 --> 01:55:07,912
..are wretched like villains?

1772
01:55:08,281 --> 01:55:09,407
No.

1773
01:55:09,616 --> 01:55:12,881
I believe that today's mothers
have no understanding.

1774
01:55:13,420 --> 01:55:14,853
They dont understand thier sons.

1775
01:55:17,023 --> 01:55:18,251
Thank you.

1776
01:55:20,260 --> 01:55:21,454
Well..

1777
01:55:21,928 --> 01:55:24,021
I completely agree
to what you said.

1778
01:55:24,798 --> 01:55:28,461
If parents understand their
kids a bit more this..

1779
01:55:28,735 --> 01:55:29,895
..will be rid off.

1780
01:55:29,936 --> 01:55:30,960
That's right.

1781
01:55:31,004 --> 01:55:32,403
But I would maintain, Milord.

1782
01:55:32,739 --> 01:55:35,537
The government cannot interfere
in this case.

1783
01:55:36,009 --> 01:55:39,308
I dont agree with this madam.
I know that until..

1784
01:55:39,512 --> 01:55:40,877
..in government schools..

1785
01:55:41,615 --> 01:55:43,014
..education's standard..

1786
01:55:43,316 --> 01:55:45,648
..doesnt improve, this problem
cannot be solved.

1787
01:55:45,952 --> 01:55:48,284
Dr. Shrivastav, I assume that..

1788
01:55:48,989 --> 01:55:51,583
..you are a psychiatrist
and not into education.

1789
01:55:52,325 --> 01:55:54,623
The discussion here
is not about the..

1790
01:55:54,761 --> 01:55:57,321
..government's educational
policies but..

1791
01:55:57,564 --> 01:55:59,259
..on parents and thier kids..

1792
01:55:59,399 --> 01:56:02,698
..putting pressure and high
expectations causing..

1793
01:56:03,370 --> 01:56:04,769
..them to break limits
sometimes.

1794
01:56:04,804 --> 01:56:07,830
Yes but these increased
expectations or pressure..

1795
01:56:07,874 --> 01:56:10,365
..are caused by government
policies too.

1796
01:56:10,577 --> 01:56:11,839
Milord.

1797
01:56:12,612 --> 01:56:14,477
I do not agree with that.

1798
01:56:14,914 --> 01:56:17,007
Well, Milord. Let me explain.

1799
01:56:17,517 --> 01:56:20,247
I believe that many parents..

1800
01:56:21,521 --> 01:56:23,853
They dont trust government
schools..

1801
01:56:24,324 --> 01:56:26,918
..whether they are primary or
secondary levels of education..

1802
01:56:26,993 --> 01:56:28,585
..they dont trust it.

1803
01:56:28,928 --> 01:56:31,726
The dont trust the quality
of education and hence..

1804
01:56:32,499 --> 01:56:33,932
..inspite of high cost..

1805
01:56:34,334 --> 01:56:36,598
..they send their children
to private schools.

1806
01:56:37,270 --> 01:56:39,830
They are spending
a lot of money.

1807
01:56:40,273 --> 01:56:42,741
Naturally, their expectations
rise too.

1808
01:56:43,343 --> 01:56:44,503
Milord.

1809
01:56:44,544 --> 01:56:48,674
What course and duration
of study..

1810
01:56:49,316 --> 01:56:51,580
..the government cant
monitor this.

1811
01:56:51,785 --> 01:56:54,686
If parents pressurise
kids to study and..

1812
01:56:54,921 --> 01:56:57,549
..have expectations from them,
it is certainly bad but..

1813
01:56:58,658 --> 01:57:00,819
The government cant do
anything about this.

1814
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:02,222
Milord.

1815
01:57:02,662 --> 01:57:04,857
I dont agree with
the state lawyer.

1816
01:57:05,699 --> 01:57:07,496
To prove my quote..

1817
01:57:07,801 --> 01:57:10,599
..I'd like to call upon Mr. Jha
into the witness box.

1818
01:57:10,637 --> 01:57:11,763
Permission granted.

1819
01:57:15,342 --> 01:57:16,604
Mr. Jha, I..

1820
01:57:16,843 --> 01:57:18,504
What does your son Gaurav do?

1821
01:57:18,878 --> 01:57:21,346
He's studying +2 from
St. Joseph college.

1822
01:57:21,581 --> 01:57:22,605
What subjects does he have?

1823
01:57:22,782 --> 01:57:23,840
Science.

1824
01:57:24,784 --> 01:57:27,275
Alongwith +2, I think..

1825
01:57:27,721 --> 01:57:29,780
..he is also getting prepared
for llT's entrance exams.

1826
01:57:30,457 --> 01:57:33,290
People take science only for
medicine, engineering and llTs.

1827
01:57:33,326 --> 01:57:35,920
Tell me something,
other than this..

1828
01:57:36,496 --> 01:57:37,588
..he cant do anything else?

1829
01:57:37,630 --> 01:57:38,688
What else will he do?

1830
01:57:39,632 --> 01:57:41,497
He'll get a good job through
this at the least.

1831
01:57:41,668 --> 01:57:42,828
He'll earn some money.

1832
01:57:46,406 --> 01:57:47,498
Note this point, Milord.

1833
01:57:48,675 --> 01:57:51,337
Many parents in India think..

1834
01:57:51,678 --> 01:57:54,238
..that medicine, engineering,
lAS..

1835
01:57:54,514 --> 01:57:57,244
No other job is worthwhile
beyond this.

1836
01:57:58,485 --> 01:57:59,918
If a boy joins the lAS..

1837
01:58:00,453 --> 01:58:02,216
..his respect in the
society increases.

1838
01:58:02,455 --> 01:58:03,752
Therefore there is immense
competetion.

1839
01:58:04,357 --> 01:58:07,554
Last year, for 4500 seats..

1840
01:58:07,827 --> 01:58:10,625
..300000 students
gave llT's exam.

1841
01:58:10,997 --> 01:58:12,624
There is highly tough
competetion.

1842
01:58:13,233 --> 01:58:15,633
That is why, parents are
pressurising children.

1843
01:58:23,610 --> 01:58:24,702
The court is adjourned.

1844
01:58:24,778 --> 01:58:26,609
Further proceedings will
be carried on tomorrow.

1845
01:58:53,473 --> 01:58:58,376
Come, lets bring the
moon to earth today.

1846
01:58:58,711 --> 01:59:02,909
Lets bank a river that
is overflowing.

1847
01:59:03,883 --> 01:59:09,253
The questions that have arisen..
we will find answers to them.

1848
01:59:09,456 --> 01:59:14,450
We will ask for an account.
We will bring parity.

1849
01:59:14,494 --> 01:59:17,395
Why be afraid?

1850
01:59:17,430 --> 01:59:22,367
Come, lets bring the
moon to earth today.

1851
01:59:22,769 --> 01:59:27,229
Lets bank a river that
is overflowing.

1852
02:00:00,373 --> 02:00:05,572
They say that there is no life
and insult the ill ones.

1853
02:00:05,612 --> 02:00:10,743
We ask them to come
and discuss it.

1854
02:00:11,217 --> 02:00:16,211
They say that it is worthless.
It is a waste of time.

1855
02:00:16,456 --> 02:00:21,416
We ask them to check it over.

1856
02:00:21,761 --> 02:00:26,892
We realise this and
dont want a war.

1857
02:00:26,933 --> 02:00:32,371
But we dont want
destruction too.

1858
02:00:32,505 --> 02:00:37,465
Our life is education.
Isnt that right?

1859
02:00:37,844 --> 02:00:42,281
Come, lets bring the
moon to earth today.

1860
02:00:43,249 --> 02:00:47,879
Lets bank a river that
is overflowing.

1861
02:00:48,488 --> 02:00:53,687
The questions that have arisen..
we will find answers to them.

1862
02:00:54,193 --> 02:00:58,823
We will ask for an account.
We will bring parity.

1863
02:00:58,865 --> 02:01:01,766
Why be afraid?

1864
02:01:01,901 --> 02:01:06,895
Come, lets bring the
moon to earth today.

1865
02:01:07,307 --> 02:01:11,801
Lets bank a river that
is overflowing.

1866
02:01:49,983 --> 02:01:56,388
The earth that we trust
and belive in.

1867
02:01:56,422 --> 02:02:00,552
At least lay a base for
that ground today.

1868
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:05,954
Some other people will come
on this land sometime.

1869
02:02:06,366 --> 02:02:11,326
They must be able to survive
this. Prepare it for that.

1870
02:02:11,571 --> 02:02:16,702
We realise this and
dont want a war.

1871
02:02:16,876 --> 02:02:22,314
But we dont want
destruction too.

1872
02:02:22,348 --> 02:02:26,978
Education should be easy.
Isnt that right?

1873
02:02:27,887 --> 02:02:32,517
Come, lets bring the
moon to earth today.

1874
02:02:32,992 --> 02:02:37,622
Lets bank a river that
is overflowing.

1875
02:02:38,665 --> 02:02:43,602
The questions that have arisen..
we will find answers to them.

1876
02:02:43,870 --> 02:02:46,430
We will ask for an account.

1877
02:02:46,572 --> 02:02:51,532
We will bring parity.
Why be afraid?

1878
02:02:52,245 --> 02:02:56,614
Come, lets bring the
moon to earth today.

1879
02:02:57,250 --> 02:03:01,687
Lets bank a river that
is overflowing.

1880
02:03:02,455 --> 02:03:07,859
Lets go. Lets go. Lets go.

1881
02:03:07,994 --> 02:03:12,693
Lets go. Lets go. Lets go.

1882
02:03:13,566 --> 02:03:18,003
Lets go. Lets go. Lets go.

1883
02:03:18,971 --> 02:03:23,032
Lets go. Lets go. Lets go!

1884
02:03:30,883 --> 02:03:33,477
Why would a child accuse
his parent?

1885
02:03:34,687 --> 02:03:37,850
He gets milk from containers and
education from the government.

1886
02:03:39,659 --> 02:03:42,992
Once, a squirrel came under
Lord Ram's feet.

1887
02:03:44,564 --> 02:03:46,395
Even though it was under
tremendous pain..

1888
02:03:46,966 --> 02:03:48,763
..the squirrel didnt complain.

1889
02:03:49,969 --> 02:03:51,561
Lord Ram asked it..

1890
02:03:52,238 --> 02:03:53,637
..why it didnt tell him.

1891
02:03:54,407 --> 02:03:55,635
The squirrel said..

1892
02:03:56,342 --> 02:03:59,834
..whenever I was in pain,
I took the name of Ram.

1893
02:04:00,847 --> 02:04:04,510
But whose name do I take
if Ram is hurting me?

1894
02:04:06,252 --> 02:04:09,415
Whenever children undergo pain,
they go to their parents.

1895
02:04:10,623 --> 02:04:12,523
But if parents cause pain..

1896
02:04:13,025 --> 02:04:16,620
..where will the kids go then.
Every child in this country..

1897
02:04:17,330 --> 02:04:19,560
..is a pillar of tomorrow's
world.

1898
02:04:20,399 --> 02:04:23,835
Our nations future
depends on them.

1899
02:04:25,304 --> 02:04:28,831
If the pillars arent strong, how
will our country be strong?

1900
02:04:30,576 --> 02:04:32,510
This question isnt
by these kids.

1901
02:04:32,712 --> 02:04:34,373
It isnt of thier parents.

1902
02:04:34,714 --> 02:04:36,306
It is not by the Indian
government.

1903
02:04:36,516 --> 02:04:39,917
The question is about
India's future.

1904
02:04:41,788 --> 02:04:43,278
You are making a mistake.

1905
02:04:44,524 --> 02:04:46,389
You think about the future..

1906
02:04:46,559 --> 02:04:47,753
..and lose the present.

1907
02:04:48,327 --> 02:04:51,592
Let the kids live
thier childhood.

1908
02:04:52,532 --> 02:04:54,363
Dont snatch their childhood
from them.

1909
02:04:55,668 --> 02:04:58,228
Dont make them old
at a young age.

1910
02:04:59,272 --> 02:05:00,933
Walk with them..

1911
02:05:01,874 --> 02:05:06,334
..and help them to fulfil their
good dreams and aspirations.

1912
02:05:07,413 --> 02:05:08,675
It isnt necessary that..

1913
02:05:08,981 --> 02:05:11,347
..children must do
what parents want.

1914
02:05:12,285 --> 02:05:15,254
You are just like them
then. Remember.

1915
02:05:15,521 --> 02:05:18,490
Every person decides
his own fate.

1916
02:05:20,293 --> 02:05:23,626
If we all understand their
dreams and pain..

1917
02:05:23,796 --> 02:05:25,764
..there wont be any more
of Navneet-like cases.

1918
02:05:26,732 --> 02:05:30,395
No more parent will
lose their child.

1919
02:05:32,839 --> 02:05:36,673
Walk the generation and
there wont be any gap.

1920
02:05:38,277 --> 02:05:40,802
Be their guide and
not a dictator.

1921
02:05:41,681 --> 02:05:46,345
I want to clarify this here that
this only applies to kids..

1922
02:05:46,686 --> 02:05:48,711
..who work hard but
their parents..

1923
02:05:49,222 --> 02:05:51,520
..cannot understand their
hard-work and aim.

1924
02:05:52,258 --> 02:05:54,988
It doesnt apply to kids
who are stubborn..

1925
02:05:55,228 --> 02:05:56,855
..and dont focus on
their careers.

1926
02:05:57,230 --> 02:05:59,391
The government of India
must first..

1927
02:05:59,565 --> 02:06:02,398
..sponsor education
till 18 years..

1928
02:06:02,435 --> 02:06:04,232
..and have it as a
fundamental right.

1929
02:06:04,437 --> 02:06:08,635
Kids must be put into school only
a year before the first grade.

1930
02:06:08,808 --> 02:06:11,504
Not two years as it s happening
now. The second thing.

1931
02:06:11,744 --> 02:06:13,769
Kids and their parents must..

1932
02:06:13,813 --> 02:06:16,839
..undergo career counselling
in every school and college.

1933
02:06:17,683 --> 02:06:19,947
This career counselling
can be of two types.

1934
02:06:20,553 --> 02:06:21,645
Firstly.

1935
02:06:22,488 --> 02:06:23,785
What the kids can do.

1936
02:06:24,457 --> 02:06:25,515
Secondly.

1937
02:06:25,725 --> 02:06:27,693
All the courses that
are available.

1938
02:06:28,294 --> 02:06:30,888
The nation can progress in
every way only when..

1939
02:06:30,930 --> 02:06:31,988
..the child..

1940
02:06:32,431 --> 02:06:34,456
..whatever he likes,
he studies..

1941
02:06:34,634 --> 02:06:37,398
..and have better chances of
getting a job according to that.

1942
02:06:37,770 --> 02:06:39,533
I would advise the Indian
government..

1943
02:06:39,805 --> 02:06:42,740
..to appoint any NGO for this.

1944
02:06:43,276 --> 02:06:46,268
A budget of 100 crores must
be sanctioned for this,

1945
02:06:46,479 --> 02:06:47,639
I want..

1946
02:06:48,314 --> 02:06:50,748
..the Indian government
to follow this soon.

1947
02:06:53,452 --> 02:06:55,682
Manjeet Singh's case
has to be decided.

1948
02:06:56,355 --> 02:06:57,379
Milord.

1949
02:06:58,224 --> 02:06:59,521
We want to say something.

1950
02:06:59,558 --> 02:07:01,458
Come to the witness
box and tell me.

1951
02:07:03,863 --> 02:07:08,266
Milord. We didnt file this
case to punish uncle.

1952
02:07:09,268 --> 02:07:10,292
Your honour.

1953
02:07:13,673 --> 02:07:16,836
I must be punished, your honour.

1954
02:07:17,877 --> 02:07:19,003
I am guilty.

1955
02:07:20,379 --> 02:07:22,438
I pressurised my child..

1956
02:07:25,418 --> 02:07:27,784
..and forced him to commit
suicide, your honour.

1957
02:07:28,587 --> 02:07:29,884
Punish me.

1958
02:07:32,458 --> 02:07:34,392
Punish me, your honour.

1959
02:07:35,761 --> 02:07:37,661
So that no parent in future..

1960
02:07:39,398 --> 02:07:41,992
..on their innocent
kids' minds..

1961
02:07:43,469 --> 02:07:44,800
..lays force.

1962
02:07:46,439 --> 02:07:47,599
Instead kids must..

1963
02:07:49,475 --> 02:07:50,669
..kept like flowers..

1964
02:07:52,979 --> 02:07:54,947
..and nurtured with love.

1965
02:07:57,483 --> 02:07:59,212
Not by using force
as in my case.

1966
02:08:03,990 --> 02:08:05,287
Today I am..

1967
02:08:06,292 --> 02:08:08,283
..before all the kids
here today..

1968
02:08:09,996 --> 02:08:11,258
..extremely sorry.

1969
02:08:13,866 --> 02:08:15,731
I ask for their forgiveness.

1970
02:08:19,739 --> 02:08:21,001
I'm sorry.

1971
02:08:26,645 --> 02:08:27,634
Milord.

1972
02:08:28,481 --> 02:08:30,415
We wish to take back our case.

1973
02:08:31,450 --> 02:08:32,576
Yes, Milord.

1974
02:08:33,786 --> 02:08:35,777
A person who has lost his son..

1975
02:08:36,689 --> 02:08:39,453
..cannot have a bigger
punishment.

1976
02:08:42,328 --> 02:08:43,818
His only mistake is that..

1977
02:08:44,797 --> 02:08:47,322
..he forced his dreams
on his son.

1978
02:08:48,267 --> 02:08:49,564
Forgive him.

1979
02:08:50,202 --> 02:08:52,932
We want this to be taken
up in the parliament.

1980
02:08:53,939 --> 02:08:55,873
It should be debated
in the parliament.

1981
02:08:57,843 --> 02:09:00,243
We cannot bring Navneet back.

1982
02:09:01,814 --> 02:09:04,749
At least we can give his
brother his father back.

1983
02:09:10,389 --> 02:09:12,220
I hope that after today..

1984
02:09:12,558 --> 02:09:14,856
..children and parents have
better understanding..

1985
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:16,359
..between themselves.

1986
02:09:16,462 --> 02:09:18,896
The case is closed and the
court is adjourned.

1987
02:09:32,344 --> 02:09:35,006
The day has come which
was awaited not only..

1988
02:09:35,314 --> 02:09:37,544
..by the nation but
worldwide too.

1989
02:09:37,750 --> 02:09:40,548
Justice Bharat Kumar made
another rightful decision..

1990
02:09:40,719 --> 02:09:43,552
..and increased public
confidence in the law.

1991
02:09:43,789 --> 02:09:46,451
Justice Bharat Kumar
in his ruling..

1992
02:09:46,559 --> 02:09:48,891
..didnt just make people realise
about their short-comings..

1993
02:09:49,195 --> 02:09:51,322
..but also the gap..

1994
02:09:51,430 --> 02:09:53,660
..that was created between
kids and parents..

1995
02:09:53,799 --> 02:09:57,200
It can be hoped that it will
help to fill that gap too.

1996
02:09:57,470 --> 02:09:59,802
Only this can be said..

1997
02:10:00,206 --> 02:10:02,800
A poet has very nicely put this.

1998
02:10:03,275 --> 02:10:06,369
'Two parts dont combine
to become four.'

1999
02:10:06,545 --> 02:10:09,514
'Make the intelligent ones
a little innocent.'

2000
02:11:53,919 --> 02:11:58,618
Come, lets bring the
moon to earth today.

2001
02:11:59,391 --> 02:12:03,760
Lets bank a river that
is overflowing.

2002
02:12:05,264 --> 02:12:09,963
Lets go. Lets go. Lets go.

2003
02:12:10,536 --> 02:12:14,666
Lets go. Lets go. Lets go.

2004
02:12:15,774 --> 02:12:20,268
Lets go. Lets go. Lets go.
