1
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,242
He's feeling relaxed.

2
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,274
His face does reveals happiness.

3
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,075
But his face and eyes
reflect fear too.

4
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:30,146
For the past 40 years...

5
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:14,259
Let's ask those coming from Oberoi
lobby about the situation.

6
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,192
We've found out that...

7
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,086
Pass me. - Here.

8
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,122
Be careful. - Careful.

9
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,249
That's great.

10
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,114
Move them back. - Get back.

11
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,105
Come on. - Get back. Go.

12
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,175
Are we distributing
offerings here?

13
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:02,232
Sir. Here. This way.

14
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,202
Come, sir.

15
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:09,114
What are you doing here? Get lost.

16
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,017
Go on. Run!

17
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,125
Yes? Sir, Mr. Rathi.

18
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,254
Get the door open. - Ok, sir.

19
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,191
Yes, sir.

20
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,194
Yes, sir. It's a double murder.

21
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,262
It's in the lane opposite
my house.

22
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,041
Yes. A lady and her son.

23
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,135
She's a teacher, sir.

24
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,239
Mother. - Yes. Ok, sir.

25
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,218
Sir. I'll get back to you, sir.

26
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:59,060
What is she doing here?
Take her in.

27
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,066
No, mother. - Come inside, child.

28
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,034
Make her stop crying. Get her in.

29
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,160
No, mother.
- Come inside, child. Come.

30
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:08,196
I won't go. No, mother. - Sir.

31
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,040
Everything is locked from inside.
Doors, windows everything.

32
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,081
Did you check the roof? - No, sir.

33
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,043
Go and check it.
- Ok, sir. - Listen.

34
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,179
If there is no way from the top.
Break the door. - Ok, sir.

35
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,281
Get back. - Where?

36
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,084
Hey, sir is coming. - Don't shout.

37
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,255
So he's the one.
Sir, the drama has started?

38
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,262
Who are you?
- Don't you recognize me?

39
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:40,162
Mangal Pandey, social worker.
Say is without fear.

40
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,106
It's a public matter.
Say is loudly.

41
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,200
Listen, Pandey, we don't
need you here. Go.

42
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,110
This is a different matter.
- How can I go, sir?

43
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,045
This is a public matter.
I can't go.

44
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,245
Don't fear. Say it loudly. - We're
here for the public, Mr. Pandey.

45
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,150
We don't live on your support.

46
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,153
We're alive as we're lucky.

47
00:05:56,255 --> 00:06:00,123
If this goes on, some day I'll
be found dead too in my house.

48
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,029
Get lost! - What have I done?
- Go on.

49
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,156
Get lost.
- You can't get away with this.

50
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:38,027
Pull it. Help!

51
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,260
What happened? - Sir, the boy is
alive. Knife is in his hand.

52
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:09,059
Sir, it's not double,
but single murder.

53
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,093
And killer is inside the house.

54
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,053
No, sir.

55
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,124
We thought it was a double murder,
but it's single murder.

56
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,227
Son has killed his mother.
Yes, sir.

57
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,097
Ok, sir.

58
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,234
Check properly!

59
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,114
Get in and open the door.
- Yes, sir.

60
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,106
Listen.

61
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,187
If he makes a move, shoot him.
- Ok, sir.

62
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,132
Get in.
Open the door. - Just a minute.

63
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,044
Mother is sleeping.

64
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,205
Give it to me.

65
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,086
Give me. Hand it to me.

66
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,164
Give me. Come on.

67
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,031
Very good.

68
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,231
Good.

69
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,241
Move aside. - He's there.

70
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,218
Get aside. Please move back.

71
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,152
Why did you kill your mother?

72
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:20,215
Tell us. Answer us.

73
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,221
What was the reason? Tell us.

74
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,061
We want to know why you
killed your mother.

75
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,159
Answer us.

76
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,146
Move aside. Let us pass.

77
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,117
Come, sir. Come.

78
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,105
Ram.

79
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,141
Ram.

80
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,179
Ram.

81
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,183
Ram, get down. - Hail Goddess!

82
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:04,126
When will he understand?
When will he grow up?

83
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,265
Ram, get down. - What happened?

84
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,065
Nothing, just get down.

85
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,033
Wait for 2 minutes more.

86
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,231
It's enough. I said come down.

87
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,266
Mother, I'm praying.
Don't disturb me.

88
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,235
I'm not disturbing,
but you're disturbing...

89
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,141
...the whole colony in the morning.

90
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,237
I'm fed up telling you
not to climb up.

91
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,214
But you don't listen to me.

92
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,241
Mother, I'm chanting mantras
for your long life.

93
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,050
Don't do it for me.

94
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,213
Now come down quickly.

95
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,082
Or I'm leaving the house.
- Don't go, mother.

96
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,284
I'm coming down, mother.

97
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,256
Mother.

98
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:08,092
There is no one like you,
O' mother!

99
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:23,097
There is no one like you,
O' mother!

100
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,270
In the entire world.

101
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,240
In the entire world.

102
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:32,207
In the entire world.

103
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:42,127
There is no one like you,
O' mother!

104
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:02,171
Even your scolding is sweet.

105
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:12,180
Your love is out of this world.

106
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:18,120
O' mother! O' mother!

107
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:24,227
I love you more than anything
else. You're my life.

108
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:31,072
On my lips there is your smile.

109
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,237
I won't live without you.

110
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:40,051
I won't live without you.

111
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:43,187
I won't live without you.

112
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:49,250
There is no one like you,
O' mother!

113
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:19,252
My life is tied with yours.

114
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,221
I'll die if this bond breaks.

115
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:34,072
O' mother! O' mother!

116
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:41,101
I always think of you, mother.

117
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:47,209
I will sing a lullaby for
you like you do for me.

118
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:53,184
Do you know this?

119
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:59,256
Do you know this?

120
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:07,161
There is no one like you,
O' mother!

121
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,072
In the entire world.

122
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,268
In the entire world.

123
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:19,242
There is no one like you,
O' mother!

124
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,179
In the entire world.

125
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,147
In the entire world.

126
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:37,126
Let's go.
Quick. - Turn on the camera.

127
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:51,114
Hurry up. - He's coming.

128
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,195
Take him away.
- Did he tell you anything?

129
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,070
Where is his mother's body?
- In the hospital for post-mortem.

130
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,239
Did you find out why he
killed his mother?

131
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,141
He's hot-tempered, sir.

132
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,153
He used to fight with
people every day.

133
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,118
He killed his mother.

134
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,120
But there must be some reason.

135
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,253
An insane person needs no reason,
sir.

136
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:39,187
He must've lost his mind
and stabbed her.

137
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,135
What's going on?

138
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,237
Close the window.

139
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,205
Tea.

140
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,090
Brother, my scooter is in
garage for servicing.

141
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,148
Bring it back please.

142
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,087
Child Juhi, eat your breakfast.

143
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,062
You're always in a hurry.

144
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,069
First change your clothes,
then you'll get tea.

145
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,242
Oh no!

146
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:28,172
Hey, you threw my phone.

147
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,234
I sold my mother's ring
to buy that phone.

148
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,099
Stop the bus.

149
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,069
Now I won't spare you. Come.

150
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:38,047
Come on. I'll teach you a lesson.

151
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,175
I'll fix you, smarty pants.

152
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,044
Get down. Don't stop. Come.

153
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,180
You fool!

154
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,250
Come on.

155
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,099
You fool! I won't spare you.

156
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:00,004
You broke my phone.
I won't spare you.

157
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,130
You don't know me.

158
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:06,076
Oh!
I've a soul that prophecies evil.

159
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,043
I feel that I see.

160
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,118
Oh!
I've a soul that prophecies evil.

161
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,049
I feel that I see.

162
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,213
Now that you're so much below me...

163
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,114
...as a dead person...

164
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:22,022
...lying at the bottom of a grave.

165
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,219
Haven't you, Romeo?

166
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,191
And trust me love, in my eye...

167
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,169
...you look pale like a dead body.

168
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,039
Bye, goodbye.

169
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,234
Is he dumb or something.
- No, not at all.

170
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:39,168
Your performance wasn't truthful.

171
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,145
Or else he would've got
involved with you.

172
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,205
You know. - Oh!
You want to see my performance.

173
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:46,251
I'll involved him so much,
that he'll follow me around...

174
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,177
...wagging his tail.

175
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,144
Oh!

176
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,095
Hi! - Hi!

177
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,296
What are you reading?

178
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,106
Oh! Laila-Majnu.

179
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,134
Romeo and Juliet.

180
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,043
It's the same thing.

181
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:19,107
They were Romeo and Juliet.
We're Laila-Majnu.

182
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,136
You idiot! Was Romeo like this?

183
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,112
Hey! Run away.

184
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,132
Come.

185
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,135
Doctor,
he's on remand for three days.

186
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,142
But he didn't say why
he killed his mother.

187
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:01,075
Try it in your way.

188
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,043
What's there to try, sir.

189
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,011
He looks crazy.

190
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,085
What's your name?

191
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,022
What's your name?

192
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,099
In which class do you study?

193
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,033
Tell me, Ram.

194
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,158
Who is in your family?

195
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,189
What is your mother's name?

196
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:06,194
Why did you kill your mother?

197
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,147
He's not abnormal, but this
isn't his normal behaviour.

198
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:56,254
Only when we ask about his mother,
he reacts.

199
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:00,224
Specially when we
try to tell him...

200
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,089
...that his mother is dead.

201
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,024
And he killed her.

202
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:11,034
It means his mind can't
accept this truth...

203
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,126
...that his mother is dead.

204
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,103
It means, he's mentally unstable.

205
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:16,265
Yes. - No.

206
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,234
It doesn't mean he's
mentally unstable.

207
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:25,239
He's only living on the extreme
side of his emotions.

208
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:29,109
Often it happens with
normal people.

209
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,085
But why doesn't he talk?

210
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:37,154
Because this is a case of a
brief psychotic disorder.

211
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:40,093
Anything can happen
in such situation.

212
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,228
In such a case,
if because of any reason...

213
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,039
...a human's emotion is hurt...

214
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,071
...he refuses to accept the truth...

215
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:54,043
...and as per his emotion...

216
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,247
...creates his own truth.

217
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,207
And right now his truth is that...

218
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:03,152
...his mother isn't dead,
but she's sleeping.

219
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,025
Why are you wasting time by
beating around the bush, doctor?

220
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,028
Just give us certificate
that he's mad.

221
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:13,059
We'll handle the rest.

222
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,999
How did you conclude
that he's mad?

223
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:19,034
Hey! His appearance suggests that.

224
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,229
And what does my appearance
suggest? Look at me.

225
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,098
What do you feel looking
at my beard and hair?

226
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,203
Do I look like a psychiatrist
or a lunatic?

227
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,080
Look, doctor... - I can see.

228
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,242
I can see that in your eyes...

229
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,054
...that you're very tense.

230
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:39,281
And you're in a hurry.

231
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:44,090
It seems not him,
but he needs a certificate.

232
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,026
Should I give you one?

233
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,122
Hey, you're unnecessarily...

234
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,223
- Don't try to teach me my job,
Mr. Khan.

235
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,127
But this... - Khan! Khan!

236
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:55,104
What should we do, doctor?

237
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,238
We need to perform brain
imaging test.

238
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:06,183
After that I'll
psycho-analyze him.

239
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:12,112
And then I'll decide about
his mental state.

240
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:16,151
By the way, doctor, when will
he be ready to testify?

241
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,028
It depends.

242
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:24,225
It's possible, anything or any
topic might make him normal.

243
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,096
Or it could take weeks too.

244
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:31,200
He himself is half mad.

245
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,169
Instead of checking him he
was playing with a ball.

246
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:39,107
Is this a way to do it? - Control,
Khan. We can't force him.

247
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:41,013
Ok, sir.

248
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:50,022
Come to police station.
We'll do something. - Ok, sir.

249
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,098
What is there to be done?

250
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:01,272
If we thrash him properly,
he'll reveal everything.

251
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,131
Get the vehicle.

252
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,204
Driver, stop. - What happened?

253
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,139
Why do you drive like a blind man?

254
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:14,049
Can't you see? How dare you park
in the middle of the street?

255
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:15,144
Move it aside. - Sorry, sir.

256
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,211
Sir, there is a problem in
the vehicle. - Then fix it.

257
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,053
In case of accident,
who would've paid for the damage?

258
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,082
What happened?
- Shukla's wife isn't well.

259
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,095
We've to get the doctor. Move this
aside. - But what happened?

260
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,087
Can't you see that we almost
had an accident?

261
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,100
Hey, move it back.
- Push the vehicle.

262
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,065
Get it back. More. - Sir.

263
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:32,262
Sir, the murderer escaped. - What?

264
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,116
Hello. Yes.

265
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,218
Phone, sir. - Who is it?

266
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:58,251
Mr. Khan, sir.

267
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:05,033
Yes, Khan. - Our van dashed
a leader's car.

268
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,071
In the commotion, that boy fled.

269
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:10,071
Yes, sir.
There was heated exchange, so...

270
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,233
What are you doing, Khan?

271
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,101
Didn't you handcuff him?
- We did it, sir.

272
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,238
Then how did he escape.
- I don't understand.

273
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,146
What can't you understand? My foot!

274
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,176
Sorry, sir. - Don't say sorry.

275
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,054
I'm trying.
- Don't try, just do it.

276
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,028
Call doctor Negi.

277
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,039
Hello.

278
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,246
Where is his mother's dead body?

279
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,092
Is mother sleeping?

280
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,263
Arith, take the boy from here.
- Ok, sir.

281
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,065
Give it, brother.

282
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,074
Love marriage, sir. After eloping.

283
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,073
Inter caste.

284
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:30,112
Her husband? - He fled...

285
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,113
...when she was pregnant with Ram.

286
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,178
Any relative?
- We didn't see anyone.

287
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,214
Nobody?
- She'd eloped from her house, sir.

288
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,118
So her family never inquired.

289
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:46,086
And she too didn't return.

290
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:49,096
She was very dignified, sir.

291
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:52,262
She was kind hearted.
Never wished anyone harm.

292
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:55,105
She was living only for her son.

293
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:57,200
Any fight between mother and son?

294
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,106
No. Never.

295
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:02,212
He'd go mad if her mother
got even a scratch.

296
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:05,081
But he was very aggressive.

297
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,208
One day in college...

298
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:11,051
...during a rehearsal of musical
play, Ram got late.

299
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:45,055
The heart is young.

300
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:49,090
The ambience is exotic.

301
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:56,065
Eyes have kindled the desires.

302
00:33:57,101 --> 00:34:03,199
Love has cast a spell.

303
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:11,080
Let me dwell in your heart.

304
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:19,053
Come to me. Come to me.

305
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:31,032
Shake up the body.

306
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,262
Shake up the body.

307
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,231
Shake up the things.

308
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:57,058
I'll the in your eyes as tears.

309
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:00,188
I'll be in your memories.

310
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:04,228
I won't be away from you.

311
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:08,102
I will move with like breeze.

312
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:15,078
Come to me. Come to me.

313
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,142
I don't like it without you.

314
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:50,079
I want to be with you.

315
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:57,145
There is nothing without you.

316
00:35:57,188 --> 00:36:04,094
Come to me. Come to me.

317
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:40,256
Yes, from the top.

318
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:44,124
Yes, lift it.
- Pass it to me. Come on.

319
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:50,131
Good. Great. Come here.

320
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:52,105
Pass the ball, Sanju.

321
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,202
Sanju, ball.

322
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:08,216
Pass the ball, friend.

323
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,121
Give it quickly, dancer.

324
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,095
Don't you understand?

325
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,105
Can't you hear? Get the ball.

326
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:29,271
To be or not to be,
that is the question.

327
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:32,239
This sentence of Hamlet,
from Shakespeare's play...

328
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,075
...is still relevant and
contemporary. Why?

329
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,210
We'll discuss it today.

330
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,121
Madam, come quickly.
Ram and Vicky are fighting.

331
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:40,214
What? - Yes.

332
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:45,253
Brother, leave me. Leave me.

333
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,163
Please... - Ram.

334
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,157
Ram, leave him. Leave him.

335
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:53,260
I beg of you. - Leave him.

336
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:17,127
I too have some limitations,
Archana.

337
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,094
If that boy had been
seriously hurt...

338
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,129
...who would've answered
his parents?

339
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,160
But sir, it wasn't Ram's mistake.

340
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,265
It's fine. I accept that.

341
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:33,108
But the way he reacts...
so violently.

342
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,078
I mean...

343
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:38,238
Look I think he's mentally... - Sir.

344
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:42,050
Please. He has no problem.

345
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,145
Ok. Ok, fine.

346
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:49,091
But if he acts like this...

347
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:52,120
...I fear he might do something
untoward some day.

348
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:00,066
Look, Archana.
I've handled it till date.

349
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,039
But next time I won't be
able to do anything.

350
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:07,169
But sir... - Archana.

351
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,205
Why don't you leave him alone?

352
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,038
I mean...

353
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,243
Send him to some hostel.

354
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:19,179
Make him independent.

355
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:22,249
If he mingles with other people...

356
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,094
...his nature might change.

357
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,223
And if you're ready...

358
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,159
...I can really help you.

359
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:36,232
I can send him,
sir, but he won't go.

360
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,109
Why not? - Because of me.

361
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:43,269
Because he thinks he's
supporting me.

362
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:47,217
If he leaves,
who will take care of me?

363
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:52,113
I... I mean try it once.

364
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:53,180
It might work.

365
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,178
Ok, thank you. - Thank you.

366
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:22,109
His friend?

367
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,161
Why are you standing? Sit.

368
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,173
What is it, sir?

369
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,084
You called my son for inquiry?

370
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:01,216
Mr. Khan, it's not inquiry,
but some questioning.

371
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:03,253
What new information could
he give you, sir?

372
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,028
Entire world knows that
the boy is mad.

373
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:07,154
- I'm doing my duty, Khan.

374
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,097
I know that he's your son.

375
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,098
But he's Ram's friend too.

376
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:14,068
They both study in
the same college.

377
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:16,071
It's possible we might
find something new.

378
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,209
But sir... - Will you get him or
should I send someone else?

379
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,093
Let it be, sir.
Mr. Khan is senior.

380
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:40,254
He's kind and honest.

381
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,065
Why are you calling his son, sir?

382
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,229
I too know him personally.
He's a nice lad, sir.

383
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:48,093
Should I call your son?

384
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:50,128
No, sir. - So?

385
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:52,130
Go and do your work.

386
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:55,168
Don't increase my general
knowledge. - Yes, sir.

387
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:05,179
Sameer. - Father.

388
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:07,053
Bye. - Bye.

389
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:10,150
Get in.

390
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:16,259
It's nothing.
It won't reach the top.

391
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,093
Mr. Khan is here. Come.

392
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:23,164
Get out. What are you doing here?

393
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:25,174
God knows from where these
bums come from.

394
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:29,236
Sir. - Sir.

395
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,175
What happened?
- How much did you get?

396
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,243
Name? - Sameer.

397
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:41,056
Full name? - Sameer Ahmed Khan.

398
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:44,090
Father's name.

399
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,051
Father's name? - Sajid Ahmed Khan.

400
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,179
What does he do?
- He's a sub-inspector.

401
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,020
Where? - Here.

402
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:18,161
How long do you know Ram?
- For 4-5 years, sir.

403
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,059
Why did he kill his mother?

404
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,061
I... I don't know, sir.

405
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,159
Answer me honestly.

406
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,034
I won't call you again.

407
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,207
Or else you'll have
to come frequently.

408
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,232
Ok, sir. But father...

409
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:35,202
You're scared of your father?

410
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,145
Yes, sir. - Why?

411
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:45,210
Listen.

412
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:49,150
Father. Father, I won't smoke.

413
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:52,255
You smoke cigarette.
- I won't, father.

414
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,230
You smoke. - I won't, father.

415
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:58,065
Your dad never touched
tobacco and you smoke.

416
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:00,127
Come, I'll make you smoke.
- Father.

417
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:04,232
Eat chocolate.
It keeps the mind healthy.

418
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:11,113
Ok, what happened later?

419
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:14,175
After that I never met him.

420
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,053
I didn't even take that bus again,
sir.

421
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:20,190
Are you telling the truth?
- Yes, sir. I swear.

422
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:24,060
Sir, I stay away from fights.

423
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,224
Stop this.

424
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:35,162
Look,
you've to come again after a week.

425
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:37,173
Why, sir?
- Senior officer wants to meet you.

426
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:40,176
But sir,
I'm going out for a month. - Where?

427
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:43,043
I'm taking mother on pilgrimage.

428
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:48,140
Ok, then take your mother
to pilgrimage.

429
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:50,212
Shall we go, sir?
- When you return...

430
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:52,118
Where? - SP office.

431
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:55,182
Oh, yes. ATS will be there. Come.
- Yes, sir.

432
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:00,195
I'll report when I return.

433
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:04,158
Stop this.
Jaideep, take his mobile from him.

434
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,262
Hey! - Ok. - Why didn't you tell me?

435
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:12,139
Does Ram smoke too?

436
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:16,169
No, sir. Not at all. He's
a very nice boy, sir.

437
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,215
He has just one problem.
He gets angry very quickly.

438
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,210
It's possible he got angry
on her mother...

439
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,017
I can't say anything, sir.

440
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,080
But he becomes different
when he's angry.

441
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:30,226
It seems as if he's possessed.

442
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,252
He isn't in his senses.

443
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:21,033
Please leave her.
Please don't do anything. - Help!

444
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:24,146
Leave her.
Please don't do anything to her.

445
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:25,170
Tie him up.

446
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:28,116
Please leave her. - Come on.

447
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:31,211
Tie her up. - Please leave her.

448
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,200
No. He'll die. Leave him.

449
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:43,117
Thanks, brother. - It's okay.

450
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:49,248
Sir, that day I felt that he
could kill anyone in anger.

451
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:53,119
And then I started keeping
distance from him.

452
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:10,178
Ram! Ram!

453
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:24,159
What happened to your hand?
- Nothing.

454
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:32,228
You fought? - No.

455
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,195
How come you're bleeding then?

456
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:39,098
I thrashed few people. - Oh God!

457
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:41,135
You thrashed! Whom?

458
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,171
I don't know. I don't know them.

459
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:45,010
Then why did you fight?

460
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:49,177
Why don't you answer?
Why did you fight?

461
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,112
They were trying to molest a girl.
- Which girl?

462
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:57,117
I don't know her too.
- Then why did you interfere?

463
00:49:57,227 --> 00:49:59,127
You should've informed the police.

464
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:01,094
I'd not time to call the police.

465
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:02,224
You'd time to thrash them.

466
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:05,101
You don't want to go to hostel
so you can do this?

467
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,136
You can't sit peacefully
even for a day.

468
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:09,198
Should I've watched
everything quietly?

469
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:12,234
No, thrash and throw people.
Break the doors.

470
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,168
Do what you think is right?

471
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:16,108
You're a judge. - Yes, I'm.

472
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:19,043
I won't be quiet if injustice
is done in front of my eyes.

473
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:22,084
Whom will you stop?
- Whomever I see doing injustice?

474
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,153
Thousands of people do wrong
things in the world.

475
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:25,245
Will you stop them all?

476
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:28,115
Yes, mother.
- What if I do something wrong?

477
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:31,160
Where are you going? Answer me.

478
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,095
Why don't you answer?

479
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:38,133
What will you do to me
if I err in future?

480
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:41,101
Will you kill me?

481
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,239
Tell me. Why don't you answer?

482
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:48,043
Will you kill me too? - Yes.

483
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:17,036
Husband's name? - Mohammed Hussain.

484
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,166
Mohammed Hussain.

485
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,101
Address? Yes?

486
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:23,270
I want to see the inspector.

487
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:42,223
I mean,
Dronacharya, great Bhisma...

488
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,091
...Jaidrath, Aurkat...

489
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:47,964
...and many warriors
were killed by me.

490
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:50,106
You too kill brave warriors.

491
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:52,031
Don't fear.

492
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:56,211
You'll surely get victory over
enemies in the battle.

493
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:58,173
So fight.

494
00:51:58,248 --> 00:52:00,239
Whom are you telling
him to fight today?

495
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:04,253
No, but I'm giving him knowledge
about right and wrong.

496
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:08,021
One who sides with injustice
is a sinner.

497
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:12,061
And it's every human's duty
to destroy such sinner...

498
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:15,095
...whether he's our
own or a stranger.

499
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:17,157
Your knowledge is having a
very good effect on him.

500
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,167
He preaches religion to someone
or other every day.

501
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:21,993
Come, Ram.

502
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,039
Greetings, teacher.
- God bless you.

503
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:31,236
Ram.

504
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:33,276
Tomorrow eleventh
chapter will end.

505
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:36,242
How many chapters are left now?
- Seven.

506
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:40,052
Oh God!
If he's in this state now...

507
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,055
...he'll be in prison after
the last chapter.

508
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:46,195
Come. - Are you chanting mantra
of longevity daily.

509
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:47,992
Yes, he's doing it.

510
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:50,294
He's doing as you've said.
Standing on one leg.

511
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,059
Come. - Bye, teacher.

512
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:07,079
What wrong could've
her mother done?

513
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:15,054
As per this test, circumstances
are totally against him.

514
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:20,094
But I don't think...

515
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:23,997
...he has...
- I agree with you, doctor. But...

516
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:29,261
Let's see. Thank you.

517
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:43,185
Come on.

518
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:46,146
Hail Ram! Hail Ram!

519
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,150
Hail Krishna! Hail Ram!

520
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:54,258
Ram. Ram. Oh, dear!

521
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,089
Ram.

522
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:05,206
Ram! Madam! Your stuff is here.

523
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,210
Where are you?

524
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:09,000
What's your name?

525
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:12,238
Atmaram.

526
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:21,154
Oh! - Get up.

527
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:23,283
Hey, leave me!

528
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:26,188
Stop it! Leave me.

529
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:28,026
What have I done?

530
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:34,031
We'll find that out, disloyal!

531
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:35,196
What? - Keep your hand down.

532
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:41,266
Please help me!

533
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:43,274
No, sir.

534
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,207
I'm not a thief.

535
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,278
Khan.

536
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:57,026
Who is this idiot?

537
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:03,032
He frequents teacher's house.
Today we got hold of him.

538
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:06,132
Oh! Send him in.

539
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:11,040
Take him in. - Come.

540
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:18,011
Do you want anything?
- No, I got enough from them.

541
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:20,275
Not that. Do you want to
eat something? - Yes.

542
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:23,218
I'm starving since morning.
They didn't even ask for water.

543
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:25,186
They just started beating me.

544
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:28,189
What will you've? - Whiskey.

545
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:31,192
What? - Tea will be just fine, sir.

546
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:34,997
What will you eat? - I can even
eat bricks if you order me.

547
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:37,032
But it'll be great if I get pilaf,
sir.

548
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:40,161
Order chicken pilaf and tea.
- Ok, sir. - No chicken.

549
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:42,294
Order vegetarian pilaf.

550
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,274
My jaw is hurting.

551
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:59,187
One feeds while other thrashes.

552
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:03,150
He forgot to add salt.

553
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:06,028
If you'd less money,
you could've asked me.

554
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:10,061
They've no standard.

555
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,232
Why are you staring me?
Get some water.

556
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:24,041
Sir, may I sit?

557
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:28,082
What's your name? - I erred, sir.
I won't even ask.

558
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,187
What's the problem?
- I can't understand that.

559
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:33,188
First they ask name,
then they start pounding.

560
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:35,182
Ok, sit here.

561
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,086
Now tell me your name.

562
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:44,266
Atmaram. - Father's name.

563
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:46,193
Parmatmaram.

564
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,265
Are you from this place?
- Yes, sir.

565
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:52,197
Who else is in your family?
- Nobody, sir.

566
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,302
Parents? - 5 years ago, sir.

567
00:56:57,046 --> 00:56:59,207
Are you married?
- I tried, but it didn't happen.

568
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,244
What do you do?
- I drive Tata-Sumo.

569
01:54:04,270 --> 01:54:07,205
Show me the license.
- I don't have it, sir.

570
01:54:08,208 --> 01:54:10,267
What?
- Tata-Sumo is name of my horses.

571
01:54:11,110 --> 01:54:13,203
Great.
- Tata is horse and Sumo is mare.

572
01:54:14,147 --> 01:54:16,115
How long do you know Ram?
- Which Ram?

573
01:54:16,316 --> 01:54:18,079
Oh, that powerful one!

574
01:54:18,218 --> 01:54:20,049
That teacher's son.

575
01:54:20,119 --> 01:54:22,212
I know him since childhood,
since he was born.

576
01:54:22,288 --> 01:54:25,189
Is he your best friend.
- No, he's like my brother.

577
01:54:25,258 --> 01:54:27,089
Why?
What happened? - Don't question me.

578
01:54:27,126 --> 01:54:29,117
Just answer my question. - Ok, sir.

579
01:54:29,229 --> 01:54:31,129
How is Ram's mother...
- She's a nice lady, sir.

580
01:54:31,231 --> 01:54:33,062
She calls me her son.

581
01:54:33,233 --> 01:54:35,292
How is her character? - Meaning?

582
01:54:36,102 --> 01:54:38,093
I mean did she have an affair?

583
01:54:38,304 --> 01:54:41,273
No, sir. What are you saying?
She's a virtuous lady.

584
01:54:42,075 --> 01:54:44,043
She gives me new clothes
on festivals.

585
01:54:44,077 --> 01:54:45,101
She's very noble.

586
01:54:45,144 --> 01:54:47,078
Then why was such a nice
teacher murdered?

587
01:54:47,247 --> 01:54:48,271
What did you say, sir?

588
01:54:48,314 --> 01:54:50,282
Why was the teacher murdered?

589
01:54:50,350 --> 01:54:52,113
No... - Why was she killed?

590
01:54:52,352 --> 01:54:56,345
I knew that there would be a
problem when police picked me up.

591
01:54:58,057 --> 01:55:00,218
Sit down.
- Sir, I didn't do anything.

592
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:02,228
Leave me. I'll change my name.

593
01:55:02,262 --> 01:55:04,230
I'll leave the city for good.

594
01:55:04,297 --> 01:55:06,060
Shut up!

595
01:55:07,300 --> 01:55:10,326
Listen. If you tell the truth,
you won't have to come again.

596
01:55:11,271 --> 01:55:13,296
Or else you'll have to come
frequently. - I swear.

597
01:55:14,073 --> 01:55:17,201
Honestly, I heard it from you
that the teacher was murdered.

598
01:55:17,277 --> 01:55:19,211
Just today I returned
from out of town.

599
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:23,113
She was a nice lady,
just like my mother.

600
01:55:23,249 --> 01:55:26,116
No, no, no. Please sit.

601
01:55:26,152 --> 01:55:29,053
She's Sumo. She's very calm.
Nothing will happen.

602
01:55:29,088 --> 01:55:32,216
Ram I'm scared.
I won't sit. - Why are you scared?

603
01:55:32,358 --> 01:55:35,122
Hop on, I'll help you.
- Why are you stubborn, Ram?

604
01:55:35,128 --> 01:55:36,186
We're here.

605
01:55:36,262 --> 01:55:40,130
We'll take care. - I'll fall...
- What happened? You mounted her.

606
01:55:40,199 --> 01:55:42,064
- The horse is fine and
you're sitting on it.

607
01:55:42,268 --> 01:55:44,259
Ram, it's enough.
- Now put your leg in it.

608
01:55:44,304 --> 01:55:47,273
Get me down. - No way. - This will
stop at the hillock now...

609
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:49,205
...when you'll conquer your fear.
Come.

610
01:55:50,076 --> 01:55:53,136
I won't spare you. Ram. - Come now.

611
01:55:53,313 --> 01:55:54,302
Very good.

612
01:55:54,347 --> 01:55:57,316
Now hold the rein and move
with hate horse in rhythm.

613
01:55:57,350 --> 01:55:59,215
Very good.

614
01:56:00,353 --> 01:56:02,218
Ram. Stop.

615
01:56:03,256 --> 01:56:06,123
Mother, don't be scared.
Keep holding the rein. Come on.

616
01:56:06,359 --> 01:56:09,226
Careful.
- I'll show you... - You've learnt.

617
01:56:09,329 --> 01:56:13,026
Now I can ride two horses.
- Don't pull...

618
01:56:13,099 --> 01:56:14,191
Should I teach you?

619
01:56:14,233 --> 01:56:16,258
Sorry, mother. Sorry.

620
01:56:17,070 --> 01:56:18,230
But mother,
you don't fear anymore.

621
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:20,329
You're not scared anymore.
You're a warrior now. - Shut up.

622
01:56:22,108 --> 01:56:24,042
If you do this again,
I won't spare you.

623
01:56:24,110 --> 01:56:26,078
Yes. Good deeds go unrewarded.

624
01:56:26,145 --> 01:56:28,272
Should I beat you? - Sorry, madam.
I apologize sincerely.

625
01:56:29,248 --> 01:56:31,307
I'm leaving.
Return home quickly, Ram.

626
01:56:32,118 --> 01:56:33,176
Ok, mother.

627
01:56:41,327 --> 01:56:44,228
Are you riding a jet?

628
01:56:46,132 --> 01:56:47,258
You too may go.

629
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:49,063
And you've already left.

630
01:56:55,341 --> 01:56:58,208
Hello. This is all your deed.

631
01:56:59,078 --> 01:57:00,272
But alcoholic horses are yours.

632
01:57:01,047 --> 01:57:03,106
This is our family matter.
Don't get involve.

633
01:57:05,051 --> 01:57:06,211
She's riding a horse, Ram.

634
01:57:07,253 --> 01:57:10,086
Do you see what I'm seeing? - What?

635
01:57:12,258 --> 01:57:14,226
Let it be. You can't see anything.
I'll handle it.

636
01:57:17,230 --> 01:57:20,063
Stop! Excuse me. - What?

637
01:57:20,266 --> 01:57:23,030
You're going to and fro.
Do you like my face?

638
01:57:23,369 --> 01:57:26,065
Don't be mistaken or your
life will be ruined.

639
01:57:26,139 --> 01:57:27,265
There are many thorns on the way.

640
01:57:27,340 --> 01:57:29,308
Your ladies motor cycle
will be punctured.

641
01:57:30,276 --> 01:57:32,073
Just mind your business.
Move aside.

642
01:57:32,245 --> 01:57:34,213
He's hot tempered.
You can't woo him.

643
01:57:34,313 --> 01:57:37,282
Hot! He's very cold, like an ice.
- Really?

644
01:57:38,117 --> 01:57:41,280
Lava inside a mountain isn't
cooled by snowfall on its top.

645
01:57:42,088 --> 01:57:43,146
It can erupt anytime.

646
01:57:43,222 --> 01:57:45,087
Yes, I'll see your volcano.

647
01:57:45,258 --> 01:57:47,226
Ok, try it. But think again.

648
01:57:48,061 --> 01:57:49,323
Think again.
Did you give it a thought?

649
01:57:51,064 --> 01:57:53,089
Did you give it a thought?
- Listen, how is your business?

650
01:57:53,232 --> 01:57:55,063
It's ruined!

651
01:57:55,101 --> 01:57:57,069
There are no tourist.
Business is down.

652
01:57:57,303 --> 01:58:00,136
How much do you want?
- Whatever I can get will be less...

653
01:58:00,173 --> 01:58:03,142
...but I can't think of anything
less than 500.

654
01:58:05,344 --> 01:58:09,303
I can count. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.

655
01:58:11,084 --> 01:58:13,075
You even blackmail people.

656
01:58:13,119 --> 01:58:16,088
Not blackmail, it's social
service. - Social service?

657
01:58:16,155 --> 01:58:18,123
Trying to fool me.
- I made a mistake.

658
01:58:18,157 --> 01:58:19,249
Who is that girl?

659
01:58:25,064 --> 01:58:29,057
What do you want, sir?
- Sit outside.

660
01:58:33,272 --> 01:58:34,296
What's the matter, Khan?

661
01:58:36,109 --> 01:58:37,235
You know it very well, sir.

662
01:58:38,144 --> 01:58:40,271
Wasn't calling my son enough?

663
01:58:41,147 --> 01:58:44,116
Now you've even called
my daughter.

664
01:58:45,151 --> 01:58:49,212
If that won't be enough,
call even my wife.

665
01:58:50,123 --> 01:58:51,147
You'll be satisfied.

666
01:58:52,158 --> 01:58:55,127
I've been doing this
job for 20 years.

667
01:58:56,329 --> 01:58:59,230
But nobody ever pointed
a finger at me.

668
01:59:00,133 --> 01:59:03,068
And you... for a lowly boy...

669
01:59:03,369 --> 01:59:06,304
...you want to malign my
life-earned respect.

670
01:59:09,275 --> 01:59:12,267
I know what's going
on in your mind.

671
01:59:16,249 --> 01:59:18,114
This... Khan.

672
01:59:19,152 --> 01:59:20,312
'Khan' is attached to my name.

673
01:59:21,087 --> 01:59:22,247
This is the reason
you're doing this.

674
01:59:22,321 --> 01:59:25,051
Had it been 'Sharma',
'Joshi' or 'Rathi'...

675
01:59:25,091 --> 01:59:27,286
...you would've thought 50 times
before calling their children.

676
01:59:34,167 --> 01:59:36,328
I pity people like you, Mr. Khan.

677
01:59:37,336 --> 01:59:40,032
I called your children
for inquiry...

678
01:59:40,139 --> 01:59:41,333
...so you're doubting
my intentions.

679
01:59:43,242 --> 01:59:45,233
Don't forget that you're
the neighbor...

680
01:59:45,278 --> 01:59:47,246
...of the house where
murder took place.

681
01:59:49,115 --> 01:59:51,106
And your family frequents
that house.

682
01:59:51,317 --> 01:59:53,217
When I called your children here,
I...

683
01:59:53,252 --> 01:59:55,083
...never thought of
their religion...

684
01:59:55,321 --> 01:59:58,222
...but of the pledge we took
while wearing this uniform.

685
01:59:59,158 --> 02:00:02,252
It was because of the duty
which pays our salary.

686
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:06,064
People want to sleep peacefully
trusting...

687
02:00:06,098 --> 02:00:07,190
...us, they don't want to die.

688
02:00:09,135 --> 02:00:13,265
And had been someone from
different caste instead of you...

689
02:00:13,339 --> 02:00:16,240
...I would've called their children
too for questioning.

690
02:00:17,109 --> 02:00:18,269
I would've even called
their wives...

691
02:00:18,311 --> 02:00:20,074
...for questioning if necessary.

692
02:00:28,221 --> 02:00:30,212
Your daughter didn't
go with that...

693
02:00:30,256 --> 02:00:32,224
...boy for romance after asking me.

694
02:00:39,232 --> 02:00:40,290
Name, Juhi.

695
02:00:41,267 --> 02:00:43,064
BA, first year.

696
02:00:44,070 --> 02:00:45,128
Father is sub-inspector.

697
02:00:47,173 --> 02:00:49,266
And daughter loves a murderer.

698
02:00:51,244 --> 02:00:53,144
Love happens in this age.

699
02:00:54,280 --> 02:00:58,046
But along with that,
what else did you like about him?

700
02:01:01,120 --> 02:01:03,088
Wipe your tears and
tell me the truth.

701
02:01:04,223 --> 02:01:05,281
I won't call you again.

702
02:01:06,259 --> 02:01:08,090
Or else you'll have
to come frequently.

703
02:01:32,251 --> 02:01:35,118
I'll leave.
This is where we part ways.

704
02:01:35,288 --> 02:01:37,222
But you... - No ifs and buts.

705
02:01:37,256 --> 02:01:39,281
I've important work. Go now. - Yes.

706
02:01:39,358 --> 02:01:41,326
Ok. Now it's up to you.

707
02:01:42,061 --> 02:01:44,120
I've done my work.
Customer is there.

708
02:01:45,064 --> 02:01:47,055
I wish I could get a client of Rs.
500 more.

709
02:01:47,266 --> 02:01:48,324
Hello, Mrs. India.

710
02:02:05,351 --> 02:02:08,047
Lift. - No, thanks.

711
02:02:09,255 --> 02:02:11,223
Our destination is the same.

712
02:02:20,266 --> 02:02:22,257
Hop on. This is a horse too...

713
02:02:22,368 --> 02:02:25,132
...with wheels.
Look, it makes sound too.

714
02:02:26,105 --> 02:02:28,266
You go. - Come on,
pal. I'm not going to bite you.

715
02:02:30,276 --> 02:02:32,039
Don't think too much. Come on.

716
02:02:34,146 --> 02:02:35,135
Come on.

717
02:03:24,163 --> 02:03:25,255
I'm sorry. - Hello.

718
02:03:27,133 --> 02:03:28,259
I'm not allergic to thanks.

719
02:03:32,104 --> 02:03:33,093
Thanks.

720
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:35,229
Thanks.

721
02:03:55,227 --> 02:03:58,094
Where are you coming from?
- Ruchi's house, father.

722
02:04:00,099 --> 02:04:02,158
Where did you find him? - Who?

723
02:04:03,302 --> 02:04:06,328
Teacher's son.
- He was walking home.

724
02:04:07,073 --> 02:04:08,199
I thought of giving him a lift.

725
02:04:09,075 --> 02:04:12,044
Is the matter limited
to just lift?

726
02:04:13,079 --> 02:04:14,103
Yes, father.

727
02:04:15,081 --> 02:04:16,241
Ok, go.

728
02:04:26,092 --> 02:04:27,184
How long will it take, madam?

729
02:04:27,326 --> 02:04:29,089
Just a little more.

730
02:04:29,161 --> 02:04:31,254
I won't let you go before
you apply henna to me.

731
02:04:31,363 --> 02:04:33,297
I won't go. Promise. Ok?

732
02:04:34,100 --> 02:04:35,192
She's always in a hurry.

733
02:04:35,301 --> 02:04:37,064
She's just like her father.

734
02:05:22,114 --> 02:05:23,103
Ram!

735
02:05:34,260 --> 02:05:37,195
Madam, it's done. Even hundred
men can't break this door.

736
02:05:37,296 --> 02:05:40,129
Let it be. You don't know my son.

737
02:05:40,166 --> 02:05:41,190
Take this.

738
02:05:57,116 --> 02:05:58,105
Ram!

739
02:05:59,285 --> 02:06:02,049
Ram! Ram!

740
02:06:03,322 --> 02:06:05,290
Ram! Where are you? Ram!

741
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:18,293
Ram! - Happy birthday to you!

742
02:06:19,238 --> 02:06:22,071
Happy birthday to you!

743
02:06:22,241 --> 02:06:26,075
Happy birthday to dear mummy!

744
02:06:26,145 --> 02:06:29,205
Happy birthday to you!

745
02:06:35,087 --> 02:06:36,111
Take this.

746
02:06:36,322 --> 02:06:38,085
Happy birthday, mother.

747
02:06:42,127 --> 02:06:45,187
Where is my gift?
- Tell me, what do you want?

748
02:06:46,065 --> 02:06:47,327
Will I get what I want? - Sure.

749
02:06:48,234 --> 02:06:49,258
I promise, mother.

750
02:06:51,103 --> 02:06:53,196
Think again.
Don't go back on your words.

751
02:06:54,340 --> 02:06:58,106
I pledge, mother.
Tell me, what do you want?

752
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:02,269
Pack your luggage.

753
02:07:06,352 --> 02:07:08,047
What, mother?

754
02:07:36,115 --> 02:07:38,083
And that day Ram left for hostel.

755
02:07:39,251 --> 02:07:41,219
Then we never met again, sir.

756
02:07:43,255 --> 02:07:46,088
Ok. - Bye, sir.

757
02:07:47,126 --> 02:07:48,115
Wait.

758
02:07:48,327 --> 02:07:50,318
Why did your father lodge
a report against Ram?

759
02:08:03,342 --> 02:08:05,071
Sir, he got bail.

760
02:08:10,249 --> 02:08:12,342
See to it that you don't return.
Get lost.

761
02:08:26,365 --> 02:08:28,060
Tell me.

762
02:08:33,339 --> 02:08:36,103
Mother's hold their children's
hands for some distance.

763
02:08:37,109 --> 02:08:38,337
But they're always
in their hearts.

764
02:08:42,147 --> 02:08:44,308
Ram! Ram, what are you doing?

765
02:08:46,352 --> 02:08:48,320
Practicing self defense. - What?

766
02:08:49,355 --> 02:08:53,052
If anyone does ragging with me
in hostel, I won't spare him.

767
02:08:53,325 --> 02:08:55,122
Even Krishna has said in Geeta...

768
02:08:55,294 --> 02:08:57,159
...one who can't defend
himself is a coward.

769
02:08:58,130 --> 02:08:59,188
Oh God!

770
02:09:00,265 --> 02:09:01,289
This... what have you done?

771
02:09:02,134 --> 02:09:04,034
I dropped a senior
from the terrace.

772
02:09:06,338 --> 02:09:07,305
Come.

773
02:09:09,108 --> 02:09:11,133
Come. - Ram, wait.

774
02:09:12,077 --> 02:09:13,305
Come home. - Why?

775
02:09:14,113 --> 02:09:15,102
We're going to hostel.

776
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:18,113
We won't go to hostel.
- You're fine here with me.

777
02:09:18,150 --> 02:09:20,209
No, mother. I've promised
you. I can't do this.

778
02:09:21,153 --> 02:09:23,144
I freed you from that promise.
Come back.

779
02:09:24,123 --> 02:09:25,112
Not like that.

780
02:09:26,258 --> 02:09:28,021
Give me your right hand.

781
02:09:28,327 --> 02:09:29,316
Like this.

782
02:09:30,262 --> 02:09:32,230
I take back my promise. Ok?

783
02:09:59,324 --> 02:10:01,315
Child, you're not ready yet.

784
02:10:02,227 --> 02:10:05,128
Get ready quickly.
You've to go to your uncle. - Ok.

785
02:10:22,114 --> 02:10:26,244
Even my shadow is in a quest.

786
02:10:27,352 --> 02:10:32,085
Every moment, life is a test.

787
02:10:33,292 --> 02:10:37,319
Even my shadow is in a quest.

788
02:10:39,164 --> 02:10:43,260
Every moment, life is a test.

789
02:10:44,269 --> 02:10:50,071
How can I live without you?
Tell me.

790
02:10:50,142 --> 02:10:55,079
Tell me. Guide me.

791
02:10:56,081 --> 02:11:01,075
My heart pines for you.

792
02:11:01,286 --> 02:11:06,314
O' beloved. O' beloved.

793
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:13,291
I've crossed all limits
in your love.

794
02:11:14,066 --> 02:11:19,197
I've crossed all limits
in your love.

795
02:11:25,244 --> 02:11:30,272
Restlessness dwells in my heart.

796
02:11:31,149 --> 02:11:35,279
I wake up when the world
goes to sleep.

797
02:11:37,089 --> 02:11:41,219
You have gone away from me.

798
02:11:42,327 --> 02:11:47,321
Our meetings have ended too.

799
02:11:47,332 --> 02:11:53,202
How can I live without you?
Tell me.

800
02:11:53,305 --> 02:11:58,242
Tell me. Guide me.

801
02:11:59,144 --> 02:12:04,241
My heart pines for you.

802
02:12:05,150 --> 02:12:10,110
O' beloved. O' beloved.

803
02:12:11,290 --> 02:12:16,318
I've crossed all limits
in your love.

804
02:12:17,129 --> 02:12:23,068
I've crossed all limits
in your love.

805
02:12:23,101 --> 02:12:28,095
In your love. In your love.

806
02:12:28,340 --> 02:12:33,277
In your love. In your love.

807
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:40,074
I've crossed all limits
in your love.

808
02:12:40,319 --> 02:12:44,312
In your love. In your love.

809
02:13:00,305 --> 02:13:02,239
From lift matter has reached here.

810
02:13:03,141 --> 02:13:05,200
Father, I came to take
notes from teacher...

811
02:13:05,243 --> 02:13:06,301
- Do you think I'm a fool?

812
02:13:08,347 --> 02:13:11,248
Do you think I'm a fool?
- Father, no.

813
02:13:13,285 --> 02:13:16,083
Father, I'm telling the truth.
- You lie to me.

814
02:13:16,154 --> 02:13:17,246
You lie to me.
- Why are you hitting your girl?

815
02:13:17,289 --> 02:13:21,089
Keep quiet!
You want to make her like you.

816
02:13:21,259 --> 02:13:24,092
What nonsense! - You act innocent.

817
02:13:24,296 --> 02:13:26,230
Keep your crazy son away
from my daughter.

818
02:13:26,331 --> 02:13:28,322
Just shut up, Mr. Khan!
Talk with respect.

819
02:13:29,201 --> 02:13:31,066
I'm just talking right now.

820
02:13:31,336 --> 02:13:34,328
Or else I know how to deal
with women like you.

821
02:13:35,140 --> 02:13:38,234
Women like me?
What do you mean to say?

822
02:13:39,077 --> 02:13:40,339
You know very well what
I want to say.

823
02:13:41,279 --> 02:13:43,076
Why did your husband leave you...

824
02:13:43,281 --> 02:13:45,306
...leaving this lunatic in
your womb? Answer me.

825
02:13:46,151 --> 02:13:47,311
Answer me. Why are you quiet?

826
02:13:48,053 --> 02:13:49,077
What happened, mother?

827
02:13:49,287 --> 02:13:51,312
Nothing.
Come inside. - Yes, take him in.

828
02:13:52,257 --> 02:13:54,157
And explain to him to stay
within his limits.

829
02:13:55,093 --> 02:13:56,321
Ram, come in.
- What have I done, mother?

830
02:13:57,262 --> 02:14:00,026
Why is he talking like this?
- I'm just talking now.

831
02:14:01,066 --> 02:14:05,162
If you don't reform, I'll imprison
you and teach you a lesson.

832
02:14:05,303 --> 02:14:07,237
Mother, tell him to keep
quiet or else... - Ram.

833
02:14:07,305 --> 02:14:09,273
Or else what? - Mother.

834
02:14:10,108 --> 02:14:12,201
Or else what? - No.
- You threaten a cop.

835
02:14:12,277 --> 02:14:14,108
I'll frame you in such
a case that...

836
02:14:14,146 --> 02:14:15,204
...you'll rot for life in prison.

837
02:14:15,280 --> 02:14:18,113
Ram, come inside.
I bind you with my oath.

838
02:14:18,116 --> 02:14:21,085
Come inside.
- Leave me. I said leave me.

839
02:14:26,224 --> 02:14:29,284
And you...
if I see you around this house...

840
02:14:31,096 --> 02:14:33,257
...I'll... - What will you do?

841
02:14:34,166 --> 02:14:35,224
You'll kill me.

842
02:14:36,134 --> 02:14:37,123
Shut up!

843
02:14:37,269 --> 02:14:39,328
Father, what sin have I done...

844
02:14:40,138 --> 02:14:42,106
...that you've created this din?

845
02:14:43,075 --> 02:14:45,043
Make him quiet! - I won't be quiet.

846
02:14:45,077 --> 02:14:47,102
If you can marry, why not me?

847
02:14:47,312 --> 02:14:49,280
Because your mother wasn't
an illegitimate child...

848
02:14:50,315 --> 02:14:52,112
...nor crazy. - Father.

849
02:14:52,150 --> 02:14:54,084
How can you say such lowly things?

850
02:14:54,319 --> 02:14:57,083
I can do many things
more than talking.

851
02:14:57,322 --> 02:15:00,223
Then do what you want.
I'll do as I wish.

852
02:15:00,325 --> 02:15:03,055
Really? Ok.

853
02:15:10,268 --> 02:15:13,260
Hello, police station.
- Khan speaking. - Yes, sir.

854
02:15:13,305 --> 02:15:17,298
- Did you get any clue in about
the arms we seized today?

855
02:15:18,143 --> 02:15:19,303
No, sir. - Listen.

856
02:15:20,278 --> 02:15:21,336
I've doubt on a boy.

857
02:15:22,314 --> 02:15:26,216
He was seen in the area from where
the arms were found. - Ok.

858
02:15:27,119 --> 02:15:29,053
File a report. - Sir.

859
02:15:31,056 --> 02:15:32,114
Hello. Hello.

860
02:15:32,324 --> 02:15:35,157
Yes, sir.
Tell me. - Name, Ram Kaushik.

861
02:15:36,061 --> 02:15:37,221
Father's name. - He has no father.

862
02:15:38,230 --> 02:15:40,095
It's happening because of you.
- Mother.

863
02:15:40,132 --> 02:15:41,258
Mother's name is Archana Kaushik.

864
02:15:41,299 --> 02:15:46,066
She's a school teacher. - Father.
- Father, please. Don't do this.

865
02:15:46,138 --> 02:15:48,038
I won't meet him again.
- Did you write it?

866
02:15:48,106 --> 02:15:50,233
Yes, sir.
- I won't even talk to him.

867
02:15:51,309 --> 02:15:53,300

Please, father. Listen to me.

870
02:15:58,116 --> 02:16:01,176
Don't do this. Please don't

871
02:16:01,219 --> 02:16:04,279
I swear. - Listen, don't proceed

872
02:16:05,056 --> 02:16:06,045
I just have doubts.

873
02:16:06,091 --> 02:16:08,252
I'll tell you to take action
when I get proof. Ok?

874
02:16:09,194 --> 02:16:10,183
Ok, sir.

875
02:16:15,267 --> 02:16:18,100
Remember. - Yes, father.

876
02:16:24,276 --> 02:16:28,235
If I see you again with that scum,
I'll break your bones.

877
02:16:30,348 --> 02:16:32,111
Come on, everyone!

878
02:16:33,318 --> 02:16:34,307
Come.

879
02:16:37,322 --> 02:16:38,311
You can go now.

880
02:16:47,132 --> 02:16:50,329
Sir,
I'm sure Ram didn't do anything.

881
02:16:55,106 --> 02:16:58,041
Love is blind. Don't follow that.

882
02:16:59,277 --> 02:17:02,246
You won't get anything.
And listen.

883
02:17:03,315 --> 02:17:05,112
Wipe your tears before going out.

884
02:17:06,117 --> 02:17:08,142
Or else it will be difficult
to control your father.

885
02:17:20,298 --> 02:17:23,290
What are you looking at?
Is anything left?

886
02:17:26,104 --> 02:17:27,093
Come.

887
02:18:05,076 --> 02:18:06,236
Listen. - Sir.

888
02:18:07,078 --> 02:18:08,136
Send Ram in. - Sir.

889
02:18:09,147 --> 02:18:11,081
Listen. - Yes?

890
02:18:12,150 --> 02:18:13,139
Ok, sir.

891
02:18:40,278 --> 02:18:42,041
Why did you kill your mother?

892
02:18:44,349 --> 02:18:46,044
You stare me, fool!

893
02:18:54,292 --> 02:18:55,281
Sit.

894
02:19:00,065 --> 02:19:01,191
Why did you kill your mother?

895
02:19:01,366 --> 02:19:03,231
With whom did she have an affair?

896
02:19:03,268 --> 02:19:05,133
Who used to come to your house?

897
02:19:11,109 --> 02:19:12,098
Stop.

898
02:19:17,115 --> 02:19:18,139
Take him away.

899
02:19:25,290 --> 02:19:28,088
These pictures are of
the biggest terror...

900
02:19:28,126 --> 02:19:30,219
...strike that took place
few days ago.

901
02:19:30,261 --> 02:19:33,059
We're going to show you
pictures of the place...

902
02:19:33,098 --> 02:19:36,067
Atheist! - Where small children...

903
02:19:36,101 --> 02:19:39,161
They should be shot in the
middle of the road.

904
02:19:39,237 --> 02:19:40,295
They're given guns...

905
02:19:41,106 --> 02:19:44,098
...and they're brainwashed
against India...

906
02:19:48,146 --> 02:19:49,135
Take this.

907
02:19:51,116 --> 02:19:52,105
Take it, Sameer.

908
02:19:56,287 --> 02:19:57,311
Did Juhi eat breakfast?

909
02:20:01,326 --> 02:20:03,123
What should I do with this girl?

910
02:20:05,163 --> 02:20:06,289
That dumb has harassed me.

911
02:20:08,066 --> 02:20:09,226
The case will move ahead
if he speaks.

912
02:20:10,301 --> 02:20:12,292
One day I'll thrash
him so severely...

913
02:20:14,072 --> 02:20:15,198
...his entire body will speak.

914
02:20:20,245 --> 02:20:21,303
No, sir. He won't speak.

915
02:20:22,313 --> 02:20:24,144
Yes, sir.
We're taking him to court.

916
02:20:24,249 --> 02:20:25,238
His remand is over.

917
02:20:26,151 --> 02:20:29,120
From there we'll take him to admit
at doctor Negi's place.

918
02:20:30,088 --> 02:20:31,350
Yes, sir. I'll be there. Yes.

919
02:20:34,059 --> 02:20:37,222
Ajay. - Yes. - Bring Ram to court
at 2 O'clock. - Ok, sir.

920
02:20:37,262 --> 02:20:40,026
- I'm going to SP office.
I'll come to court from there.

921
02:20:40,131 --> 02:20:41,120
Right, sir. - Ok?

922
02:20:56,247 --> 02:20:58,044
Irshad Hussain.
- What did you lose?

923
02:20:58,216 --> 02:20:59,308
Purse. - Ok.

924
02:21:00,118 --> 02:21:01,107
Hello, sir. - Chain.

925
02:21:01,319 --> 02:21:03,287
Hello. How are you, Sameer?

926
02:21:04,089 --> 02:21:06,114
Fine, sir. - Mr. Khan is on field.

927
02:21:08,159 --> 02:21:10,320
Sir,
I want to meet Ram, not father.

928
02:21:11,162 --> 02:21:12,288
What? - I want to meet Ram.

929
02:21:12,330 --> 02:21:13,319
Are you mad?

930
02:21:14,232 --> 02:21:15,290
Nobody is allowed to meet him.

931
02:21:15,366 --> 02:21:17,231
Please, sir. Just for two minutes.

932
02:21:17,302 --> 02:21:19,065
Will you get me in trouble?

933
02:21:19,104 --> 02:21:21,129
He has already harassed us.
Now you've come to meet him.

934
02:21:21,239 --> 02:21:22,297
I've come to explain to him.

935
02:21:23,274 --> 02:21:25,139
He'll tell everything.
He's my good friend.

936
02:21:25,276 --> 02:21:27,210
Please. - Ok, but hurry up.

937
02:21:27,312 --> 02:21:28,301
Thank you, sir.

938
02:21:37,088 --> 02:21:39,079
Ram. Ram.

939
02:21:41,292 --> 02:21:42,350
What has happened, friend?

940
02:21:43,128 --> 02:21:44,254
It was terrible!

941
02:21:46,164 --> 02:21:48,064
Let bygones be bygones.

942
02:21:48,299 --> 02:21:51,291
And accept your mistake.
Humans err.

943
02:21:52,337 --> 02:21:54,100
But don't be quiet.

944
02:21:55,073 --> 02:21:57,166
Accept it, brother. Or else father
will hit you mercilessly.

945
02:21:58,109 --> 02:21:59,337
Sameer, hurry up, my brother.

946
02:22:00,245 --> 02:22:02,236
If Mr. Khan comes,
he'll scold both of us.

947
02:22:02,347 --> 02:22:05,111
Just two minutes, please.
- Hurry up.

948
02:22:11,089 --> 02:22:14,058
If you confess,
you won't be punished severely.

949
02:22:14,259 --> 02:22:17,228
But don't ruin your life
by keeping quiet.

950
02:22:19,264 --> 02:22:22,131
Ram, do you understand me. Look.

951
02:22:22,333 --> 02:22:24,233
I don't want them to torture you.

952
02:22:25,069 --> 02:22:26,297
I want your well being.

953
02:22:27,272 --> 02:22:29,297
Ram, you don't know, but
father hits mercilessly.

954
02:22:30,141 --> 02:22:31,108
Who allowed him in?

955
02:22:31,276 --> 02:22:33,301
What are you doing? - Get out.
- He came.

956
02:22:34,078 --> 02:22:35,238
Get out. What are you doing here?

957
02:22:35,346 --> 02:22:37,314
Father... - Come on.

958
02:22:37,348 --> 02:22:39,111
I just came to meet him.

959
02:22:40,318 --> 02:22:41,307
Come on.

960
02:23:11,115 --> 02:23:13,083
We're showing you picture
of another terrorist.

961
02:23:21,226 --> 02:23:22,250
Mother!

962
02:23:27,365 --> 02:23:29,230
Mother! What happened, mother?

963
02:23:30,168 --> 02:23:31,226
Mother!

964
02:23:32,136 --> 02:23:33,262
Mother, what happened? Mother.

965
02:23:37,075 --> 02:23:38,303
Mother. Mother, talk to me.

966
02:23:39,110 --> 02:23:40,202
Mother. Mother.

967
02:23:44,349 --> 02:23:49,184
Mother. Mother, who did this?

968
02:24:48,279 --> 02:24:50,042
Mother. Mother.

969
02:24:51,249 --> 02:24:52,273
Get up.

970
02:24:54,085 --> 02:24:55,245
Give me food, mother. I'm hungry.

971
02:24:57,088 --> 02:24:58,077
Mother.

972
02:25:00,291 --> 02:25:01,315
Who is there?

973
02:25:06,097 --> 02:25:07,121
Get out. Who is there?

974
02:25:39,130 --> 02:25:40,119
Mother is sleeping.

975
02:26:55,339 --> 02:26:57,034
Mother.

976
02:27:06,083 --> 02:27:07,072
Mother.

977
02:27:10,254 --> 02:27:11,243
Mother.

978
02:28:00,304 --> 02:28:01,293
Hey!

979
02:28:06,077 --> 02:28:07,203
Stop there. Where are you going?

980
02:28:18,222 --> 02:28:21,055
Sir. Sir,
that boy fled from police station.

981
02:29:18,082 --> 02:29:19,242
Did you try his house?

982
02:29:22,320 --> 02:29:24,151
Thank you, doctor. - Come.

983
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:30,304
Father.

984
02:32:00,144 --> 02:32:01,304
Mother. Mother.

985
02:32:03,114 --> 02:32:05,207
Ram! Leave him.

986
02:32:05,316 --> 02:32:06,305
I said leave him.

987
02:32:08,052 --> 02:32:09,076
He killed my mother.

988
02:32:12,323 --> 02:32:14,052
What rubbish!

989
02:32:15,326 --> 02:32:17,191
Mother gave this to
me before dying.

990
02:32:18,162 --> 02:32:19,254
And it's from his shirt.

991
02:32:24,301 --> 02:32:27,065
No, father.
He's lying. He's lying.

992
02:32:27,138 --> 02:32:29,265
He has gone crazy. I don't know
what he's rambling about?

993
02:32:29,306 --> 02:32:31,069
Scoundrel!

994
02:32:31,308 --> 02:32:34,243
Scoundrel! - What are you doing?
- Why did you do this?

995
02:32:34,345 --> 02:32:37,075
Why did you do this? - Father.

996
02:32:37,248 --> 02:32:39,113
Tell me. Why did you do this?

997
02:32:39,116 --> 02:32:41,084
You've defamed me.

998
02:32:41,118 --> 02:32:42,210
Father... - I won't spare you.

999
02:32:43,087 --> 02:32:44,213
I won't spare you.

1000
02:32:44,355 --> 02:32:48,223
Tell me.
Why did you kill his mother?

1001
02:32:49,293 --> 02:32:52,262
Tell me the truth or
else I'll shoot you.

1002
02:32:52,329 --> 02:32:56,060
I'll tell you. - Tell me.

1003
02:33:05,075 --> 02:33:06,337
I apologize on father's behalf.

1004
02:33:12,082 --> 02:33:15,245
He has seized arms brought
to serve our community.

1005
02:33:21,358 --> 02:33:23,223
Oh God! Have mercy!

1006
02:33:27,097 --> 02:33:28,325
Bye. - Bye.

1007
02:33:29,366 --> 02:33:31,095
Bye. - Bye.

1008
02:33:33,103 --> 02:33:34,195
Sameer.

1009
02:33:35,306 --> 02:33:37,274
Yes? - Sit.

1010
02:33:50,087 --> 02:33:53,250
Read this.
You'll get strength. - Yes.

1011
02:33:55,125 --> 02:33:56,114
And listen.

1012
02:33:57,294 --> 02:34:01,094
Be careful. - Ok.

1013
02:34:01,265 --> 02:34:02,254
Goodbye.

1014
02:34:14,111 --> 02:34:18,070
God is great! God is great!

1015
02:34:28,325 --> 02:34:30,293
Madam. - You? - Madam.

1016
02:34:30,327 --> 02:34:33,091
Madam, listen. Please, madam.

1017
02:34:33,130 --> 02:34:36,122
Listen, madam.
Please listen, madam.

1018
02:34:36,267 --> 02:34:38,292
Please listen, madam.

1019
02:34:38,335 --> 02:34:41,099
Please listen to me, madam.

1020
02:34:41,138 --> 02:34:44,073
Madam, please. - Move aside.
I'll tell your father now.

1021
02:34:44,174 --> 02:34:46,301
He calls my son mad and
his son is a terrorist.

1022
02:34:46,343 --> 02:34:48,106
Madam, I'm not a terrorist.

1023
02:34:48,145 --> 02:34:50,079
I was just checking it.
Please, madam.

1024
02:34:50,147 --> 02:34:52,138
Ok, give it to me. - Madam.

1025
02:34:52,216 --> 02:34:54,081
I'll show it to your father now.

1026
02:34:54,118 --> 02:34:57,281
No.
If father finds out he'll kill me.

1027
02:34:57,321 --> 02:34:59,221
Please don't tell him, madam.
- Give it to me.

1028
02:35:00,090 --> 02:35:02,320
Give it to me now.
- Please listen to me, madam.

1029
02:35:03,060 --> 02:35:05,324
Ok. - I'm not a terrorist.
- Let the police decide.

1030
02:35:06,063 --> 02:35:07,223
Please, madam. - Move.

1031
02:35:19,343 --> 02:35:21,311
Madam, keep the phone down
or I'll kill you.

1032
02:35:22,146 --> 02:35:24,307
I'm warning you.
Keep the phone down.

1033
02:35:25,115 --> 02:35:28,107
Oh! Very good. You'll kill me.

1034
02:35:28,285 --> 02:35:30,344
Kill me.
Let me see what you can do.

1035
02:35:31,055 --> 02:35:33,023
Madam, I'll kill you.
I'm telling the truth.

1036
02:35:33,157 --> 02:35:34,317
Now your father will
deal with you.

1037
02:35:35,259 --> 02:35:38,057
Keep the phone down.
I'll stab you, madam.

1038
02:35:54,111 --> 02:35:56,272
What have you done, Sameer?

1039
02:36:30,247 --> 02:36:31,271
Get up.

1040
02:36:33,250 --> 02:36:34,274
Come.

1041
02:36:43,227 --> 02:36:44,285
Hey! - Hey!

1042
02:36:46,096 --> 02:36:47,222
Sameer, what are you doing?

1043
02:36:47,297 --> 02:36:50,061
Leave me. Let me go.
- Give me the gun. - Move.

1044
02:36:50,134 --> 02:36:51,294
Sameer, give the gun back.
- Move back.

1045
02:36:52,236 --> 02:36:54,136
I'll shoot. - Give the gun, child.

1046
02:36:54,271 --> 02:36:56,102
Look... - I'll shoot.

1047
02:36:56,140 --> 02:36:57,300
Don't act stupid. - Let me go.

1048
02:36:58,108 --> 02:36:59,166
Don't be mad. Listen to me.

1049
02:37:03,313 --> 02:37:06,077
What have you done, Sameer?
- Move back.

1050
02:37:06,250 --> 02:37:08,115
I'll fire, father. - What?

1051
02:37:08,118 --> 02:37:09,244
No, Sameer. - Don't be mad.

1052
02:37:09,286 --> 02:37:11,220
What are you doing?
- I'll shoot, father.

1053
02:37:19,129 --> 02:37:21,029
Sameer, what have you done?

1054
02:39:20,350 --> 02:39:22,318
Mother is greater than
any community, Sameer.

1055
02:39:47,144 --> 02:39:50,238
O' mother!

1056
02:39:58,322 --> 02:40:00,290
As you can see these
are the people...

1057
02:40:00,357 --> 02:40:02,222
...who are connected to those arms.

1058
02:40:02,259 --> 02:40:04,193
Get aside. - They were seized...

1059
02:40:04,328 --> 02:40:07,092
A big tragedy is averted in
this city. - Move back.

1060
02:40:07,097 --> 02:40:09,258
No organization has taken
responsibility.

1061
02:40:10,100 --> 02:40:11,226
In this operation...

1062
02:40:11,268 --> 02:40:14,066
...police officer Mr. Rathi and
Mr. Khan were injured...

1063
02:40:28,318 --> 02:40:32,049
O' mother!

1064
02:41:44,127 --> 02:41:50,088
There is no one like you,
O' mother!

1065
02:41:56,340 --> 02:42:04,304
There is no one like you,
O' mother!

1066
02:42:06,249 --> 02:42:15,055
In the entire world.

1067
02:42:16,093 --> 02:42:22,293
There is no one like you,
O' mother!

1068
02:42:41,251 --> 02:42:46,052
My life is tied with yours.

1069
02:42:47,357 --> 02:42:56,265
I'll die if this bond breaks.

1070
02:42:57,134 --> 02:43:00,069
O' mother! O' mother!

1071
02:43:00,303 --> 02:43:06,242
I always think of you, mother.

1072
02:43:07,110 --> 02:43:13,106
I will sing a lullaby for
you like you do for me.

1073
02:43:13,250 --> 02:43:16,117
Do you know this?

1074
02:43:16,286 --> 02:43:25,251
Do you know this?

1075
02:43:26,129 --> 02:43:34,264
There is no one like you,
O' mother!

1076
02:43:36,072 --> 02:43:38,199
In the entire world.

1077
02:43:39,109 --> 02:43:47,278
There is no one like you,
O' mother!

1078
02:43:48,318 --> 02:43:51,116
In the entire world.
