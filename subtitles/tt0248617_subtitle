1
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:35,473
Back in India, after 25 years
in London, yet pure Hindustani

2
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,224
London...

3
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:11,831
A home there...

4
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,846
a home here

5
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,252
Shalini

6
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,960
HaPPY birthday, my love

7
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:43,230
The priest gave me
a garland of flowers...

8
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,809
for your portrait

9
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,272
But garlands are for those
who have departed

10
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:55,819
But you haven't departed,
you're with me...

11
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,145
with me, every moment

12
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,824
No, no news of Sanya

13
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,335
It's past three am

14
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,035
Let me check out the house
once again

15
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,394
Where have you been?
- Friend's birthday

16
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,795
I went out for a party.
- You know what time it is?

17
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,479
Aren't you ashamed? For four hours,
I've been looking for you

18
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:06,613
Why? I'm not a kid! Go to bed, Papa.
We'll talk in the morning

19
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,975
Why not now?

20
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,827
You've been drinking alcohol?
- Not alcohol. Just wine

21
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,765
I told you! Let's talk
in the morning

22
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:40,376
Else I'll complain to the police,
I'll report you

23
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,785
Are you out of your mind?

24
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:31,296
For the children,
I'm no friend...

25
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,901
unless I have answers
for their questions

26
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,766
Drinking coke, in the store?
- Why not?

27
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:40,110
I know it's your weakness,
I've stocked up on Coke

28
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,570
Not one, I have two weaknesses.
One's this, the other is...

29
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,772
your soft, lovely tresses

30
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,176
Besides, this is the best coolant
for my hot head

31
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:54,122
Coolant for your hot head is also
this. Look at this greeting card

32
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,792
Sanskrit shloke

33
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:03,200
The only time I heard Sanskrit,
was the only time I spoke Sanskrit

34
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,470
And that was during my wedding,
and then the priest...

35
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,797
recited the mumbo-jumbo
and thence on...

36
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,803
to Buckingham, Birmingham,
and all over

37
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:21,150
You are the scholar,
you are the Oxford professor

38
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,821
Better you translate
that for me

39
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,495
Meaningm?

40
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:42,771
Till the age of five,
children are to be loved

41
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:47,172
After they turn ten, you ought
to keep an eye on them

42
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:52,443
Once that have reached sixteen,
you ought to make friends with them

43
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:59,786
Get that, love?
At sixteen, make friends

44
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,794
That's if you want
a happy home, forever

45
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:08,264
Old hat.
- Also today's new message

46
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,628
Striking a friendship
with my daughters!

47
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,794
For a father like me!
In an alien land...

48
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,797
Return the trolley.
I'll be in the car

49
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,302
How can this be?

50
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:08,842
The doctor gives me only
2 or 3 minutes to talk to you

51
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:16,258
No love, I'm with you

52
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:23,027
In 25 years, I haven't even taken
a breath without depending on you

53
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,136
You've taken care of everything...
what am I to do?

54
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,809
The homes, the daughters...

55
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,805
how am I to take care of them?
What will I talk to them about?

56
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,151
You will...

57
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:51,090
you are their mother, Papa too

58
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:59,428
Just promise me one thing.
- Tell me, love

59
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:06,833
Till they are married,
don't stay away from them...

60
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,336
be friends with them

61
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:14,844
How will I do it, love?
Ever since they have grew up...

62
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,850
I haven't even had a simple
conversation with them

63
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,647
Remember that Sanskrit shloke?

64
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,123
Yes

65
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,139
Give happy farewells
to our three daughters

66
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,709
Understand them...

67
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,610
give them understanding

68
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:55,477
There! I've slapped you.
Come to the police

69
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:57,616
Report me

70
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:08,560
If not with me,
your friend of 25 years...

71
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,631
with whom will you open up?

72
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:16,830
You're my kin. Before who else,
can I bare my heart?

73
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,037
Stop bickering over every
small thing

74
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,846
So what if they're daughters?
The world is full of daughters

75
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:27,079
If he can't, well he can't

76
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,788
If you're my son's best friend,
why can't you be best friends...

77
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:36,120
with your daughters?
- L.K... daughters are different

78
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,189
What will you do then?

79
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,795
I'm thinking of returning to India,
for a change of environment

80
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:52,799
For a father, playing mother
is tough

81
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,809
Kids these days!

82
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,349
Ever since he was a child...
I put Ronit away in a hostel

83
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:17,991
That's why I left mine in Lahore.
Kids, stay where you belong

84
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:53,793
Beat me up. Give me a bad beating.
I had gone crazy

85
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:59,799
No my baby, you're my best

86
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:10,817
Papa, we three have promised never
to make you unhappy, never to fight

87
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:23,493
It's all my fault children,
it's all my fault

88
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:31,096
Now I understand what a great friend
your mother was to you

89
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:38,110
The father is merely the provider
of money, comforts

90
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,114
But the mother...

91
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:46,786
like a friend, she shares
your woes, your sorrows

92
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,251
I tried

93
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:55,129
Yes, I tried,
but I failed...

94
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,797
to understand you,
your feelings

95
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:11,813
No Papa. Now that Ma is gone,
you are our friend

96
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,479
We'll do whatever you say

97
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:33,162
For me today, the only true East
where the sun rises, is my India

98
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:47,784
The departure of my dear friend Raj
for India, leaves London deserted

99
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,780
My friend, he's gone.
- Start worrying about your son

100
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:56,391
Off he goes to India,
right behind Raj?

101
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:03,292
Simple sweetheart. For him,
Raj is father, mother and friend

102
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:07,798
Sure! You and I aren't
his parents at all

103
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,139
We are, only for namesake

104
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:21,613
Ronit is the son of Raj and Shalini,
in thought, in mind, in nature

105
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,553
Which is why, he's so middle-class

106
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:34,428
And he leaves this palatial house
and sets up studio! Dance, music...

107
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:38,758
Mohobbatcom !
- An artiste, he's an artiste

108
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,811
Indian music ties millions of
Asian Indians across the world...

109
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,605
in a single thread

110
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:29,481
The end of all quarrels over
race and creed? Indian music

111
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,823
Teaches one language to Punjabis,
Marathis, Gujaratis, Bengalism?

112
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,159
Makes every Indian
a global 
ndian...?

113
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:44,427
For friendships, love, marriages...

114
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:48,100
log on to our dotcom,
cdgurusom

115
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,838
Ronit, Raj uncle called for you.
He has emailed too. Read it

116
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,515
After Coke-Mohobbatcom...

117
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:10,850
we aren't accepting sponsorships for
anything less than 500,000 dollars

118
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,854
If they agree, okay

119
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:33,610
Sorry for coming away to India without
telling. Lalit will tell you why

120
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,820
Sorry pal, I had too.
You must've understood

121
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:45,819
Pointless telling you that we miss you.
We keep talking about you

122
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,632
Just today I was telling
lsha and Avantika...

123
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:53,826
about the incident in your college,
when Shalini and I were visiting you

124
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,238
You had just been awarded the trophy
for the best student in the college

125
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:04,846
You sidetracked Lalit and Nalini,
and you headed straight for me

126
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:10,183
You forgot your parents and
you touched Sha
ini's feet

127
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:18,522
Lalit was so jealous! I remember.
And it made Shalini double-happy

128
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:28,867
With memories like these we're trying
to settle down to our new lives

129
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:33,138
In any case, lsha is returning
to London to complete her studies

130
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:39,814
Take care of yourself, Ronit.
Your best friend, Uncle Raj.

131
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,638
Loves...

132
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,643
griefs...

133
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,410
tales...

134
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,646
words

135
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:36,800
Words are forgotten

136
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,210
Memories return

137
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:00,186
Memories cherished,
of beloved ones...

138
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:04,824
return once they're gone

139
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:39,328
Life, my darling...

140
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,201
is like flowing water

141
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:51,213
After the water has flown...

142
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:56,809
what remains?

143
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:02,819
Memories

144
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,476
There are loves

145
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,617
There are griefs

146
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,619
There are tales

147
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,485
There are words

148
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,823
Words are forgotten

149
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:12,989
Memories return

150
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:20,498
Memories of the loved ones come back
once they have departed

151
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,837
Oh these memories...

152
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,837
alas memories...

153
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:35,175
All of us, in our worlds...

154
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:41,121
long for our memories

155
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:47,196
Some happinesses,
bits of sorrows...

156
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:52,999
they belong to us,
we belong to them

157
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,464
Memories...

158
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,930
sweet memories

159
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,933
bittersweet memories...

160
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,815
of loves...

161
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,373
of griefs...

162
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,383
of tales...

163
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,545
of words...

164
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:19,484
of words forgotten...

165
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:25,359
but memories return...

166
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:31,439
memories cherished,
of beloved ones...

167
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:35,768
returning once they're gone

168
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,813
New York, Mr Black

169
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:30,767
Our shares were down till yesterday,
not today. Just you watch...

170
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:35,434
by Monday next, they're going
to peak. Yes, we're praying...

171
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,368
to the Goddess of Fortunes. Now
she will grace my home

172
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,110
You tell that to those mutual funds

173
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:48,780
Join us for the prayers

174
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,784
Your uncle is very angry.
Come, say the prayer

175
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:59,458
An artiste! That's what your son is.
Does he know how important it is...

176
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:04,790
to propitiate the Goddess of Fortunes?
- How could I? Till last year...

177
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,925
you were trying to propitiate
the Goddess of Bounty

178
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:11,267
Worship didn't bear fruit.
Therefore... change

179
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:16,973
The pundits say that he fell foul
of the Goddess of Fortunes last year

180
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:23,278
Worship done, She will be placated.
- The Goddess has been invoked

181
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,618
Seek and you shall be given

182
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,555
Really?
- Seek, then see

183
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,420
Do I speak out what I seek?

184
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,492
As you wish

185
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,764
O'Goddess of Fortunes...
You are the Mother of all

186
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,774
The mighty, the lowly, the rich,
the poor, are all devoted to You

187
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:53,375
The millions of poor in India
worship You

188
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,985
Then why do You not go there
to eradicate their poverty?

189
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:03,449
Over here, we are all so rich.
What use Your staying here?

190
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:09,460
O'Mother, desert the rich,
go to the poor

191
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,394
All of India awaits Thee

192
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:21,100
Actually we're all fine here.
Quite fine

193
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,804
All we need are
Your blessings

194
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,820
Ma, I'm going to call Uncle Raj.
Go on with the prayers

195
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:38,827
Saw your son's insolence?
That's the result of...

196
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,826
not keeping children
on a leash

197
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:53,173
You should be ashamed! Such insolence?
- Because I said the truth?

198
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:58,244
God isn't meant to be propitiated for
purposes. A prayer should be heartfelt

199
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,251
Where to, now?
- To Uncle Raj

200
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:09,248
Your friend, he is.
But his heart, I know

201
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:15,525
Just think. After all these years
abroad, what drives him homeward...

202
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:19,859
is sheer agony. If we aren't the ones
to share his sorrows, who else will?

203
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:37,143
Nalini, who bore Ronit?
You, or Shalini?

204
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,311
Oh brother-in-
aw...!

205
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:48,491
Your mother always said that after
all of you were married off...

206
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:52,298
she wanted both of us to retire,
and come to live in India...

207
00:29:52,824 --> 00:30:00,174
here, in this farm house. And when
it's about time, she leaves, saying...

208
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:04,439
Not their Papa, be their friend Papa

209
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:09,846
Ma was 500 percent right!
- Papa, where did you first meet her?

210
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:16,251
And who said I love you first?
You or Mamma? Please, tell us

211
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:18,449
I did

212
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:24,857
Tell us, when did Mummy say
I love you for the first time?

213
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,199
You're going too far.

214
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:31,033
On one hand, you want to be Papa-friend!
On the other hand, just look at you...

215
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:37,040
Can you tell me, what if someone
says something romantically...?

216
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:40,977
What romance? The fellow
who does that gets slapped

217
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:44,075
Just get married and push off

218
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,718
What Papa means is that
if something like that happens...

219
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:50,520
first of all,
we'll tell Papa

220
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:02,829
Today, on my birthday, let's give each
other a promise as friends. An agreement

221
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,639
Didn't get that.
- No need to get worked up

222
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:16,375
What I mean to say is,
sometime or the other...

223
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:21,187
somewhere or the other, there will
surely come into your lives...

224
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:25,526
a boy who wants to marry you,
whom you want to marry

225
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,858
What's wrong with that Papa?
- When did I say anything's wrong?

226
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:34,796
All I'm saying is, you have every
right to marry, and I'll concede too

227
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,263
But...

228
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:44,541
remember one thing. The right to choose
the family he comes from...

229
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:48,147
will be mine, completely mine.
You'll give me so much, won't you?

230
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:52,411
Why Papa?
- How naive, my child!

231
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:57,819
You won't be marrying only the boy

232
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:02,558
You will be marrying into the family

233
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:05,498
The entire family. Right?

234
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:10,636
Papa is absolutely right!
Condition accepted, what?

235
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:17,377
Today, let's make a promise
to ourselves, as friends

236
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:21,850
To talk from the heart,
with an open mind

237
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,844
Let's be a well-knit,
friendly family

238
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:43,802
Avantika rustles up the fries
and the sweets, fast!

239
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:47,803
No fries, no sweets. First,
give us a song

240
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,137
Which song?
- Our favourite one

241
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,671
You left me all alone
and came to India

242
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:58,945
I know you would come

243
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,806
You come to India, you forget!
Not even a phone call...?

244
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,439
Idiot, remember me?

245
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,575
All forgotten

246
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:53,601
Our memories,
Coke-Mohobbatcom

247
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:59,205
The whole world has turned into
one dotcom, which draws closer...

248
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:01,603
Indians in every corner
of the world

249
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:09,076
Those who don't want to fall in love,
can get married straightaway

250
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:12,318
How come?
- Consider yourself. Assuming...

251
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:16,280
we are to choose for you,
a handsome worthy

252
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:21,820
Our ShaadLcom can tell you where
and how to find the most suitable boy

253
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:28,837
Now you come to the point! Tell us.
- Computer, advise us where to find...

254
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,232
a suitable, handsome boy,
the right match for Avantika

255
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,432
Here you are

256
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,469
3 boys

257
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,182
I like all three

258
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:44,575
Let's get all three married off

259
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:55,395
The boy in the middle is Pankaj.
Pankaj Kudesia. I know him

260
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:58,333
How come?
- We studied together In London

261
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,793
Presently, he's a vice president
with Hotel Surya in Delhi

262
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:05,197
He was in London,
but he stayed Indian

263
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:09,801
Well Avantika?
- Not I

264
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,615
There's a boy for Sanya too.
Take a look

265
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,317
Find someone for our lsha too

266
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,760
Scan lsha into the computer

267
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,564
Here we go

268
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,584
What was that?

269
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:13,799
Talk to the groomspeople
clearly, openly

270
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:20,806
You know lsha, I can't take this
Hahn-ji, Nan-ji small-talk

271
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:24,819
What scant pluck I have is because
I have Ronit with me. Else...

272
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:30,759
What can Ronit do? He's a baby.
Elders talk to each other

273
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:35,420
Stop depending on him.
- But I...

274
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,922
Not buts to yourself

275
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:45,933
<i>Mr Ra}, Ron“ is to me
what my son Panka‘; is</i>

276
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:50,769
Ronit has told us everything
about Avantika. All I wanted...

277
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:54,780
was to meet you. Now we've met.
- Me too... what I wanted...

278
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:59,555
What I wanted, Ronit...
- What he wanted was to meet you...

279
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:05,192
and ask you... you know wedding matters
if you have any conditions, demands

280
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:10,796
Exactly! Whatever it be, be sure
to ask. I'll fulfill everything

281
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:18,303
Decent parents, a good girl and
a simple wedding... my 3 conditions

282
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:23,606
Nothing more.
- Yes, and have nothing to worry

283
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:27,144
At home with us, Avantika won't face
the slightest hardship

284
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:30,346
That's exactly what I meant

285
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:37,415
Well, have I been talking excessively?
- Not a question of excesses

286
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:41,829
All I've been trying to tell him
is to make a clean breast

287
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,157
One colour, you know.
Differing shades create problems

288
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:50,835
Black or white. If it's black,
let it be black, completely

289
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:56,337
If it's white, let it be all-white.
But some people will ruin...

290
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,440
the best of situations, trying
to mix black with white

291
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:03,842
That's where the confusion arises,
and confusion leads to problems

292
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:10,248
And for every problem, finding
a solution is tough, if handy

293
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,455
Thanks to good company,
we have a solution

294
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:17,859
One must be alert,
but no problem...

295
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:20,959
everything can be solved

296
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,273
How about tea or something?
It's been quite long

297
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:35,477
How long have you been working here?
- Uncle Khanna isn't a servant...

298
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,209
he's Daddy's friend of 35 years.

299
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,351
He owns a golf club

300
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:59,237
As good as servant. Mohanlal demands
loyalty from his friends

301
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:06,512
Enough! Let me leave before
another faux pas

302
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,841
And look at my little master
staring me down

303
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:14,646
Because of your cross-matched socks

304
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,836
What riddle is this?

305
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:17,250
Why are such strange things
happening?

306
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:20,850
<i>My restlessness...</i>

307
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:30,458
<i>My restlessness, my loneliness</i>

308
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:35,467
In <i>my restlessness</i>
I <i>am so lonely</i>

309
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:32,123
What strange breeze blows
this year?

310
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:38,525
Try as much as I will,
but my feet are unsteady

311
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:46,803
Why do these thoughts
cross my heart...?

312
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:52,810
when I see my friends
wearing the henna...?

313
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:03,622
makes me wish
I could wear it too

314
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:13,362
What riddle is this?

315
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:18,830
Why are such strange things
happening?

316
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:41,797
The days are too short,
these nights too long

317
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:48,202
Before the monsoons
it has begun raining

318
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:56,204
In my dreams
I have met someone

319
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:02,546
Go away! Don't teach me
these strange things

320
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:12,817
The two of you have killed me

321
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:17,888
What riddle is this?

322
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:22,831
Why are such strange things
happening?

323
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:56,801
This is no picture,
this is a message

324
00:44:57,394 --> 00:45:03,106
From far away, someone
sends you greetings

325
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:10,818
He's handsome,
he has a cute name

326
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:17,282
And good friends
bring hearts close

327
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:27,834
One of you is to be a bride

328
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:37,771
What riddle is this?

329
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:43,041
Why are such strange things
happening?

330
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:21,139
Cycles have brakes, you know?
- Off to London without a bye-bye?

331
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:25,143
But I met everyone.
- Except me, idiot

332
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:29,807
Didn't think it necessary.
Idiot, you were busy working out

333
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:34,622
I would've missed my plane.
Hey, did you miss me?

334
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:36,953
Not at all!

335
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:41,293
On the day of the wedding, Papa gave
me a gift for you. I forgot about it

336
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:44,829
Here's your message

337
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:51,568
Your gift. From Papa. Not from me.
- From Papa?

338
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:54,998
You can put it on, can't you?

339
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:07,515
I've seen two nice boys
on my shaadLcom

340
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:11,854
One for Sanya,
one for you

341
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:14,518
For me?

342
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:19,857
Why?
- I don't want to marry

343
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:24,269
Until when?
- Until college is over

344
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:30,208
And afterwards?
- I'll do whatever Papa says

345
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:35,147
Marriage, or love-marriage?
- I don't believe in love

346
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,816
I know. But why?

347
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:43,157
Romantics are useless.
They're filmi

348
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:48,225
In real life, love's an entertainment
package that comes with youth

349
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:54,834
When girls like you fall in love,
great love stories are made

350
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:04,309
Girls like me only make history,
not love stories

351
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:13,517
Remember, there will come the day,
when a handsome young man...

352
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:19,518
will move you to tears.
That day, your love story begins

353
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:40,610
That will happen,
that will surely happen

354
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:50,818
I ask you, who is this boy?
Who is he?

355
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:56,355
Papa, he's Sukant. I've known him
for a year. He lives in Delhi

356
00:50:56,953 --> 00:51:01,629
And I'm in love with him.
- But I've seen him...

357
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:04,431
in the company of ruffians.
Outside our house in London

358
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:08,833
Yes Papa, but Sukant
is very good at heart

359
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:17,307
Besides, we've decided to marry.
- So decisions have been taken already?

360
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:19,843
Then who needs me?

361
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:27,259
At least I should have the right
to choose my husband

362
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:47,815
Oh! Love-romance.com...?

363
00:51:54,811 --> 00:52:01,820
Look, your daughter loves our son.
- And our son loves us both

364
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:06,294
He's our only son. We got him educate
in London, and he's just back

365
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:12,232
You know Mr Raj, we received
so many proposals for our son

366
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:18,107
But we refused all of them.
- In this case, the kids are in love

367
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:22,641
Hang love! My son is a gem

368
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:27,179
Your daughter is lovely too.
She'd be lovelier if she wore clothes

369
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:33,121
Mamma please, don't overdo it.
- I'm not! This concerns marriage

370
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:38,254
We ought to talk openly, yes Mr Raj?
- Even I want you to talk openly

371
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:40,459
rm Open!

372
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:46,808
We aren't lusting for a dowry.
- We have no objection...

373
00:52:47,063 --> 00:52:49,942
to whatever you wish to give
your daughter, no objection at all

374
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:54,582
We don't want suits, clothes, nothing!
- But the wedding venue must be...

375
00:52:54,804 --> 00:53:00,152
a five-star hotel. Hotel Surya!
Those with a standing do it in style

376
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:04,622
The relationship doesn't end with
the wedding. The exchange continues...

377
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:07,624
even after the wedding.
- After the wedding begins...

378
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:11,162
the real relationship.
Comings-goings keep happening

379
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:15,829
But we aren't greedy, not at all

380
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:22,577
Uncle, you haven't eaten anything...?
- No son, not hungry. I'm in a hurry

381
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:24,835
That's all?

382
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,514
I enjoy this

383
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:31,383
I don't understand! Who am I to marry?
Sukant or his family?

384
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:35,484
That's what I'm trying to tell you
again and again! After the wedding...

385
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:38,658
you aren't going to be called
neither Juliet-in-love nor Mrs Sukant

386
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:44,326
After the marriage, you'll be called,
sister-in-law, daughter-in-law, aunt...

387
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:46,998
and you will have to live up to all
those relationships. And his family...

388
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:51,299
isn't worthy of you!
- You just don't want me to be happy

389
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:56,210
This I've come to know. But I've taken
the decision about my life. Period

390
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,602
Then hear out my decision too

391
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:07,143
Saw that? Heard that?

392
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:23,168
I've got to know everything.
Let me talk to her

393
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:32,179
For a father, handling daughters
is so problematic

394
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,589
Where do they come from?

395
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:48,159
Leave me! I don't want to live!

396
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:51,464
Why are you crying?
- Sanya doused herself with kerosene

397
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:53,464
She's trying to set herself afire!

398
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:58,204
Leave me! Let me die!
I want to go to my mother!

399
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,799
Have you gone out of your mind?
- If not yourself, think of us...

400
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:04,602
think of Papa! Do you know
what you're doing?

401
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:07,710
Does anyone care for me?
I don't want to live

402
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:11,547
Sanya! You've gone crazy?
- Yes! I'm crazy!

403
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,412
Leave her

404
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:15,550
Let her be

405
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:17,825
Sanya, what is the matter?

406
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:22,119
You aren't my Papa!
- Sure, I'm not

407
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:24,621
You aren't!
- No, I'm not

408
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:28,234
Come here, and listen to me.
Over there... listen...

409
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:40,305
I tried to make you see reason,
but you won't see reason

410
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:45,176
It will be as you want

411
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:49,120
You're going to marry
the man you want

412
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:54,192
Sukant
- Yes Sukant. But remember one thing

413
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:58,789
The future of this marriage
is solely your responsibility

414
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,201
I'll manage

415
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:07,136
Avantika, lsha, let's
prepare for the wedding

416
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,303
Delhi-folks...

417
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,639
folks with a heart...
Salaams from the heart

418
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:46,178
So finally, today,
Sanya and Sukant's love triumphs

419
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:52,379
What a thing love is!

420
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:57,783
At some point of time or the other,
somewhere or the other...

421
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:00,787
everyone without exception
has fallen in love

422
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:04,131
Some have been consummated,
some loves have gone unrequited

423
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:07,801
But love lives on

424
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:16,210
In the name of love, we the youngsters,
have decided that tonight's song...

425
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,145
isn't mine. I'm not singing

426
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:22,810
Uncle Raj sings

427
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:29,620
Amazed, Uncle Raj?

428
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:21,205
Some years ago friends,
there was talk...

429
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:28,212
of me falling in love with someone

430
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:35,217
We too had a first meeting

431
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:42,186
I too fell in love with someone

432
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:15,518
In the rains, on the streets...

433
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:22,269
holding an umbrella, I was going,
she was coming... like this

434
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:43,556
We crashed into each other,
we were embarrassed

435
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:50,428
We said, please forgive me,
what we meant was...

436
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:53,164
Give me your heart

437
01:00:14,877 --> 01:00:18,848
Romance happened
by chance

438
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:23,593
We became lovers,
but we had little time

439
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:28,458
In a hurry, I give my heart,
I call the priest...

440
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:32,802
I sit on a horse,
I become bridegroom

441
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:37,807
I become the bridegroom

442
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:45,812
So beautiful

443
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:56,820
So beautiful was the night
when we wed

444
01:00:57,286 --> 01:01:01,234
Oh yes, I too fell in love
with someone

445
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:06,273
Some years ago friends,
there was talk...

446
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:10,643
of me falling in love with someone

447
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,359
Had she been here tonight...

448
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,661
she would've played the dholak

449
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:38,803
She would've been happy

450
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:43,209
She would've kissed her girl

451
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:48,813
She would've blessed you,
she'd ward off the evil eye

452
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:54,215
She would've sung a song of love

453
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:59,183
Oh wouldn't she have
have made me burn...

454
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:03,420
in fires of jealousy

455
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:09,827
But everything is changed,
everything's changed

456
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,644
There was a day when
I wept like rain

457
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:26,347
Oh yes, I too fell in love
with someone

458
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:31,358
Some years ago friends,
there was talk...

459
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:35,788
of me falling in love with someone

460
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:57,149
Loves...

461
01:02:57,707 --> 01:02:59,812
griefs...

462
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:01,617
tales...

463
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:03,813
words

464
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:08,557
Words are forgotten

465
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:13,329
Memories return

466
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:38,790
Memories cherished,
of beloved ones...

467
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:44,794
return once they're gone

468
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:01,814
Papa! What are you doing?
How's lsha?

469
01:04:02,104 --> 01:04:04,277
lsha is away in Malaysia,
for a cycle race

470
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:08,252
You know, in London,
Uncle Ranbir Rai has been named...

471
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:11,290
best businessman of the year.
It was on tv

472
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:29,842
Congratulations Mr Rai

473
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:33,006
Congratulations Mrs Rai

474
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:38,941
Malhotra, you're wonderful!
- How come?

475
01:04:39,108 --> 01:04:41,782
No sooner than I get the award,
you've thrown a party for me

476
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:44,788
I have given you my hand
in friendship, never to let go

477
01:04:45,848 --> 01:04:48,192
You haven't sampled my
friendship yet

478
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:54,794
Raj keeps praising you to the skies.
- Raj is like a son

479
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,795
I've known him since he was a baby.
- His daughter's wedding...

480
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,964
we couldn't attend.
- You know, business matters...

481
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:05,335
Monishka hasn't come?
- There she is, with your son

482
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:07,814
American Indians and British Indians

483
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:11,815
I keep visiting your cdgurusom

484
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:18,224
There are more dotcoms.
dostLcom, mohobbatcom, shaadLcom

485
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:25,095
Right from friendship to love?
- And from love to marriages

486
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:27,828
Marriages? How boring

487
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,572
What does the pair look like?

488
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:42,782
What programme for tomorrow evening?
- Tomorrow, I'm flying to Malaysia

489
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,919
To cover the Asian Cycle Race.
- Cycle race?

490
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:48,210
Yes, big race

491
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:12,936
lsha is here too?
- I know

492
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:18,015
But she doesn't know I'm here.
- But where's she?

493
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:22,549
Son, you can't even see her.
Only I can see her

494
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,386
Today's the first day
of the Asian Cycle Race

495
01:06:25,548 --> 01:06:29,826
Companies from 21 countries
have sent their best racers here

496
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,689
Sunday, the biggest day
of this event will see...

497
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:38,767
Preeti Sawhney of Dubai participating.
She is an Indian, and she has won...

498
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:42,340
this race the last two times,
consecutively. This year too...

499
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:44,433
there seems to be no competition
for her in sight

500
01:06:57,246 --> 01:07:00,125
Let's introduce you
to lsha Puri from London

501
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:03,127
Where are you from?
- England

502
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:06,130
Where from, originally?
- India

503
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,399
Your name?
- lsha

504
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:11,470
Your goal?
- Always number one

505
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:13,431
You have a boyfriend?

506
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:16,465
You don't believe in love?

507
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:20,607
Not at all.
- What about affairs?

508
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:23,476
Are you crazy?
- No

509
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:31,758
Trying to make a fool out of me?
- And make a fool out of a fool?

510
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:36,153
A childhood love...

511
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:43,269
Never expected you'd crop up here.
- Just dropped by

512
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:47,171
I knew you'd be here.
- Papa must've told you

513
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:53,441
Also true. But you had to be here,
you're the cycle-event star

514
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:56,582
I'm just a small-time
reporter here

515
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:03,515
Look Ronit, don't mind.
I'd like to be independent here

516
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:07,189
Far from the world, far from home.
- And far from me...?

517
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:10,460
Maybe, too.
- Yes...?

518
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:13,799
So in this event,
you and I...

519
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:16,292
strangers

520
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:18,661
Yes, strangers

521
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:28,611
Come on, only an hour
to go for the heats

522
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:46,729
Wait, wait, wait...

523
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:48,996
Soft fingers...

524
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:50,999
warm hands...

525
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:54,639
and solid wrists.
You can be the only one

526
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:07,511
I could stop a race to hear
that compliment

527
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:10,653
If you've said I'm best,
I'll become the best

528
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:12,654
Now the race starts!

529
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:17,263
Preeti, I like your nature.
- I like everything about you

530
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:21,528
Pass-Pass. Want some?

531
01:09:28,864 --> 01:09:33,142
Look, plying him with Pass-Pass
to get close

532
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:35,804
My belt is a bit too tight

533
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,818
Look! Undoing her belt

534
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:50,158
How will I win tomorrow's race?

535
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:14,252
What happened?

536
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:19,856
Papa! I don't want to live in
Sukant's house! It's Hell, not home

537
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:25,858
His mother is so abusive!
His father keeps cursing me

538
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:31,465
Sukant takes sides with his mother!
They're scum!

539
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:35,468
I've thought it over,
I want a divorce, that's all

540
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:41,804
You were right, Papa

541
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:47,811
All this about being in love is
a lot of nonsense. lsha was right

542
01:10:51,513 --> 01:10:57,828
Relax, you're home, aren't you?
Come on, my child

543
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:15,210
There goes Preeti Sawhney,
full steam

544
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:18,378
All eyes, all bets
on Preeti Sawhney

545
01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:44,811
Pr_eeti Sawhney,
gomg great guns

546
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:48,812
Tailing her, lsha Puri,
trying her best

547
01:12:28,977 --> 01:12:32,789
lsha Puri of Hero Cycles
wins the Asian Championships

548
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:47,797
It's the fire in the heart
that takes you to victory

549
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:54,073
That dig was for you.
- She's the heroine

550
01:12:56,305 --> 01:12:58,307
A few words for our dotcom?

551
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:04,484
Yes, I'm not saying thank-you
to anyone. It's my grit...

552
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:08,454
my determination that has led me
to my victory. And God's grace

553
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:11,820
No one takes any credit

554
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:18,567
And these tv websites are full of
half-truths. Please don't trust them

555
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:23,838
Congratulations

556
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:29,509
But winners aren't so vainglorious.
- Then losers are?

557
01:13:33,776 --> 01:13:35,949
You go to your Ms Pass-Pass

558
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:40,792
I see... you are...

559
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:45,798
That was just a joke...
- Look Mr Stranger...

560
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:50,129
I'd like to say something straight.
Tomorrow friends and I...

561
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:54,066
are visiting Tuba Island.
No need to pursue me

562
01:13:56,198 --> 01:14:00,078
Ronit, Tuba Island is full
of dangerous beasts

563
01:14:01,303 --> 01:14:02,805
Stop her

564
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:48,190
Wait! We're leaving lsha behind

565
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:02,799
lsha is on Tuba Island! In trouble!
- Her friends have deserted her...

566
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:02,600
Any news of lsha?
- Oh yes, lots of news

567
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:04,793
Just because of your heroine,
our hero is in trouble

568
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,700
Even cellphones
aren't working here

569
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:26,979
Last night, the doctors
nearly gave up on Ronit

570
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:32,091
I got to see him.
- You're supposed to rest

571
01:17:33,915 --> 01:17:38,921
Maybe you don't appreciate it,
but what he did was unimaginable

572
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:45,762
How's Ronit?
- Out of danger

573
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:14,799
Remember I told you,
there'll be tears in your eyes?

574
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:18,794
What's this?

575
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:23,307
Let go

576
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:25,600
Let go of my hand

577
01:19:07,843 --> 01:19:12,258
I told Sanya that when my mother
loses her temper, she just flares up

578
01:19:13,181 --> 01:19:18,460
And Sanya talks back at her. Straight.
- Whatever I said is justified

579
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:26,537
I don't want to stay in that house.
- And I'm in a fix. For no reason

580
01:19:27,062 --> 01:19:32,808
Sukant is here for Sanya.
- I'll find a house once I have a job

581
01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:37,406
I can't live with his mother. Period

582
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:41,347
Things don't work out this way, Sanya

583
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:52,489
Look son, I understand everything.
Just wait a while

584
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:58,828
You decided on this marriage
between yourselves

585
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:03,071
You must find the solutions
for yourselves

586
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:12,683
When hearts meet...

587
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:15,515
flowers blossom

588
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:18,583
When hearts meet,
flowers blossom

589
01:20:18,914 --> 01:20:21,588
When flowers blossom,
hearts meet

590
01:20:22,117 --> 01:20:24,393
Hearts meet...

591
01:20:24,853 --> 01:20:27,129
flowers blossom

592
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:14,846
Oh, love's fires

593
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:25,517
When the flames of passion are lit,
storms rage in the seas of the heart

594
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:28,861
The earth is shaken,
skies rent asunder

595
01:21:34,589 --> 01:21:39,402
Love's ruination too,
love is a prayer too

596
01:21:39,928 --> 01:21:42,807
Some pray for love,
some curse

597
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:59,148
When hearts meet...

598
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:01,825
flowers blossom

599
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,491
When hearts meet,
flowers blossom

600
01:22:07,822 --> 01:22:10,632
When flowers blossom,
then hearts meet

601
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:19,268
Oh, love's fires

602
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:00,480
Ever since you...

603
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:03,085
came into my heart

604
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:05,824
Life has been...

605
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:08,491
so difficult

606
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:14,090
Even amidst revellers
lam lonely...

607
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:19,568
in loneliness I revel

608
01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:28,510
This is a world of our love,
come embrace me

609
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:31,780
Put an end to this suffering

610
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:50,166
Whatever you wish...

611
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:52,802
let us do, oh let's do

612
01:23:53,328 --> 01:23:55,604
Right here, right now...

613
01:23:55,964 --> 01:23:58,205
oh let me die

614
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,303
Our hearts...

615
01:24:01,736 --> 01:24:04,012
oh dear sweet hearts...

616
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:06,678
with memories...

617
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:09,615
let us fill

618
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:15,490
Let hearts meet

619
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:23,836
Let hearts meet,
let flowers blossom

620
01:25:31,759 --> 01:25:34,433
Some pray for love,
some curse

621
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:39,775
Some curse, some pray

622
01:25:45,073 --> 01:25:48,213
Lies! All lies

623
01:25:49,777 --> 01:25:55,784
Lies, everything! Friendship...
this love, romance, all lies

624
01:25:56,784 --> 01:26:00,789
All deceptions! What a mistake I made,
conceding! You lied to me

625
01:26:01,356 --> 01:26:03,802
A father can never be
his daughter's friend...

626
01:26:04,592 --> 01:26:06,333
he can never be

627
01:26:07,695 --> 01:26:10,141
How I wish I had never
given my consent

628
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:42,904
Everyone is in Udaipur, and here you
are, still. It's so late. Now go on

629
01:26:44,232 --> 01:26:47,236
Your friend's silver jubilee
wedding anniversary! lsha and Ronit...

630
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:49,980
are hosting a grand show, and you...?
- But...

631
01:26:50,172 --> 01:26:55,451
No buts. I know you're worried
about Sanya. I'll take care of her

632
01:26:56,611 --> 01:27:00,491
Please, don't tell anyone
about Sanya, not even lsha

633
01:27:01,183 --> 01:27:05,791
Why spoil the party? VIPs from
all over the world are there

634
01:27:16,465 --> 01:27:21,813
Rajasthan, Udaipur is home for me.
What I don't understand is...

635
01:27:22,304 --> 01:27:27,151
how you chose the Maharajah's palace
for the party from faraway London?

636
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:33,021
It's my son Ronit's idea.
Preparations for the party...

637
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:37,830
the music, the celebrations are all
being organised by Ronit and lsha

638
01:27:38,153 --> 01:27:43,432
<i>But you haven't introduced Ron“ to us.
- Oh yes, where's Ron“? Ca“ him</i>

639
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:51,177
Ronit, don't force me to dance
at the party. I don't know dancing

640
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:55,175
Who else is going to dance with me?
- Latch on to some butterfly

641
01:27:55,570 --> 01:28:01,851
Lots of them flying about. You love
flattering them, don't you? Do that

642
01:28:06,715 --> 01:28:09,924
What are you staring at?
- Your eyes

643
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:17,125
Just keep sitting

644
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:21,630
Ever since we met,
we've been friends

645
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:25,134
Today we're lovers.

646
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:29,813
Tomorrow...
- Tomorrow...?

647
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:35,747
Just you and I, together...
- Just us?

648
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:38,046
Just us

649
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:47,733
Where are you my friend?
Your friend is here

650
01:28:47,923 --> 01:28:48,924
Go to Papa

651
01:28:49,558 --> 01:28:51,162
Okay, I'm off

652
01:28:53,695 --> 01:28:56,175
You'll talk to Papa, won't you?

653
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:58,975
About what?
- Don't you know?

654
01:28:59,234 --> 01:29:02,943
Oh yes! I'll tell him,
get lsha married off fast

655
01:29:03,438 --> 01:29:06,442
If she falls in love with someone,
it could be a problem, no?

656
01:29:21,122 --> 01:29:23,124
You're late, but I forgive you

657
01:29:24,392 --> 01:29:27,805
Before someone else tells you,
I'd like to tell you something

658
01:29:28,129 --> 01:29:30,405
I get the first say.
- First listen to me...

659
01:29:30,565 --> 01:29:32,010
Me first...
- Me

660
01:29:32,133 --> 01:29:33,942
Me! Thrice over, and it's me

661
01:29:35,136 --> 01:29:38,140
Listen....
Listen my friend...

662
01:29:39,808 --> 01:29:42,948
Sanya...
she married her lover

663
01:29:44,312 --> 01:29:48,317
Now she's back at home.
She wants to divorce her husband

664
01:29:50,652 --> 01:29:53,292
She can't put up with his family

665
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:00,730
Such is what comes of love, my friend

666
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:13,516
I know! I got to be happy, I got
to smile, I got to sing

667
01:30:14,109 --> 01:30:15,611
Avantika says...

668
01:30:15,877 --> 01:30:18,881
Don't go there with a sad face.
Keep smiling, stay with Ronit

669
01:30:19,214 --> 01:30:22,388
And after all, it's my friend's
silver jubilee wedding anniversary

670
01:30:22,851 --> 01:30:26,128
I got to sing, got to dance

671
01:30:39,034 --> 01:30:41,139
Don't overdo it.
- Am I not entitled to fun?

672
01:30:50,679 --> 01:30:53,159
You are...?

673
01:30:53,748 --> 01:30:56,160
We met at the party...

674
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:00,966
How can I forget you?

675
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:18,114
Back in America, whenever
I was on the computer...

676
01:31:18,573 --> 01:31:21,281
I was always logging onto
cdgurusom

677
01:31:23,111 --> 01:31:27,287
I've memorised all your dotcoms,
all your catchlines

678
01:31:33,722 --> 01:31:36,794
lsha is refusing to dance!
We need at least one lean girl

679
01:31:46,301 --> 01:31:50,147
Why don't you be my dancing partner?

680
01:31:56,811 --> 01:31:58,620
For us, do it, please

681
01:32:04,486 --> 01:32:06,432
Do it, for me

682
01:32:09,858 --> 01:32:11,531
For you, dotcom

683
01:32:15,163 --> 01:32:20,112
Everyone from Buckingham Palace
to Chandigarh is falling in love

684
01:32:20,635 --> 01:32:24,447
It's echoing all over with
I-love-you-s

685
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:39,554
Once you're in love...

686
01:32:39,788 --> 01:32:42,132
you're restless

687
01:32:44,292 --> 01:32:49,298
They'll scare you, but you
aren't even scared of God

688
01:33:14,355 --> 01:33:16,892
This is a glittering evening

689
01:33:23,898 --> 01:33:26,105
My cup brimmeth over

690
01:33:45,153 --> 01:33:51,502
Life's another name for love

691
01:33:54,829 --> 01:34:00,142
Here's one from the heart...
Oh Baby

692
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:09,888
Hear my chiming bracelets?

693
01:34:13,081 --> 01:34:16,654
Talk-talk-talk...

694
01:34:17,085 --> 01:34:19,087
this doll talks

695
01:35:16,144 --> 01:35:18,146
Scorching sunshine,
and not a shade...

696
01:35:18,313 --> 01:35:20,315
in love's world of mazes

697
01:35:20,615 --> 01:35:22,822
You're the princess
in the maze, my love

698
01:35:23,151 --> 01:35:25,563
Just let me take your hand

699
01:35:30,158 --> 01:35:34,504
I wish no one ever knocked
at the window to my heart

700
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:39,504
I wish no one else
leads you out of the maze

701
01:35:41,836 --> 01:35:43,838
Legends...

702
01:35:44,172 --> 01:35:45,913
they wrote

703
01:35:46,441 --> 01:35:50,184
Immortal legends

704
01:35:51,179 --> 01:35:59,189
For love, they lived,
for love, they died

705
01:36:06,461 --> 01:36:08,805
Love's a blast

706
01:36:15,637 --> 01:36:18,140
My lover's fun

707
01:36:44,299 --> 01:36:48,645
The colours of love
never wear off

708
01:36:49,037 --> 01:36:51,039
Romeos will never
g
ve up lovmg...

709
01:36:51,239 --> 01:36:53,845
no matter how many
heartbreaks

710
01:36:56,177 --> 01:37:00,182
In the end, you lose, I win

711
01:37:00,548 --> 01:37:05,122
Losing to you will be dearer
than winning

712
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:15,138
Today we're face-to-face

713
01:37:17,131 --> 01:37:20,544
I'm holding my heart

714
01:37:27,408 --> 01:37:30,150
Oh what a sway

715
01:37:37,018 --> 01:37:39,498
Swaying to your rhythm

716
01:37:42,023 --> 01:37:49,168
What the prophets have said,
lovers have done...

717
01:37:51,165 --> 01:37:54,635
given hearts, taken hearts

718
01:38:56,330 --> 01:39:00,779
My brother, Ronit, everyone is gone.
Today I'm leaving for London too

719
01:39:01,235 --> 01:39:05,308
I've come to know about Sanya.
What happened is very bad

720
01:39:07,108 --> 01:39:11,784
But my brother has some good advice.
He says, we can help Sukant...

721
01:39:12,113 --> 01:39:16,118
get a nice job in a friend's firm
in Dubai. Sukant can send home...

722
01:39:16,284 --> 01:39:20,289
a good amount every month for his
greedy parents. They'll be happy

723
01:39:20,621 --> 01:39:22,464
Sanya will be happy

724
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:27,804
How much indebted I am
to your family

725
01:39:31,132 --> 01:39:34,875
Yesterday, my brother had another
thing to say too. Quite strange...

726
01:39:35,236 --> 01:39:39,150
What?
- That Ronit should marry Monishka

727
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:43,315
Marry...? He has still to take
an education, he must go places

728
01:39:47,482 --> 01:39:50,156
Didn't you watch, at yesterday's
party? During the dance...

729
01:39:50,485 --> 01:39:53,659
how he held her hand,
how he drew her close?

730
01:39:57,725 --> 01:40:03,505
Yes, oh yes! Fool I was,
not to have noticed all this

731
01:40:07,101 --> 01:40:12,107
My brother is much, much-interested...
- Then what's the problem?

732
01:40:13,508 --> 01:40:15,181
Why don't you raise the topic?

733
01:40:15,610 --> 01:40:20,787
So what do you think of the alliance?
- What have you to think...

734
01:40:21,115 --> 01:40:27,532
of your daughter's airs? Twenty-one
proposals, and madam likes not one!

735
01:40:28,890 --> 01:40:34,135
<i>For the ﬁrst time, she says,
about Ron“, not-bad</i>

736
01:40:35,630 --> 01:40:38,941
Not bad! After all, your daughter

737
01:40:40,134 --> 01:40:44,139
I say, let's say yes to
Raj's proposition

738
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:49,588
Else, she'll live to be an old maid.
- I like Ronit too

739
01:40:50,378 --> 01:40:52,380
He'll handle Monishka quite well

740
01:40:53,147 --> 01:40:55,149
In that case you should see Raj

741
01:41:06,093 --> 01:41:10,633
Tell Malhotra that I accept
his proposition

742
01:41:18,406 --> 01:41:22,513
We've known you for many more years
than we know Ronit and the Malhotras

743
01:41:23,110 --> 01:41:28,116
Suffices to say that we're giving our
daughter away because we trust you

744
01:41:35,623 --> 01:41:39,799
Everything went off first class!
- What are you saying? Really?

745
01:41:40,194 --> 01:41:42,401
I'm coming to London day after
tomorrow. But remember...

746
01:41:42,563 --> 01:41:45,134
not to tell Ronit
anything until I'm there

747
01:41:51,772 --> 01:41:54,150
Where are you?
- Heathrow airport

748
01:41:54,475 --> 01:41:57,479
We're in Thorpe Park. Come over.
- Right away

749
01:42:18,099 --> 01:42:21,603
I have news for you!
I've something to tell you!

750
01:42:27,108 --> 01:42:31,523
But we got the biggest news to break!
- I got news!

751
01:42:31,846 --> 01:42:33,348
Me first.
- Me first

752
01:42:33,514 --> 01:42:35,118
Uncle Raj, me first!
- Me first

753
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:37,288
Thrice over. Overruled

754
01:42:49,797 --> 01:42:51,743
I have a company policy.
- What?

755
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:56,141
Special messages are sent
in style. <i>As</i> in...

756
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:00,414
this

757
01:43:03,544 --> 01:43:07,890
Read on. We'll be back
to take your blessings

758
01:43:08,516 --> 01:43:09,654
Blessings?

759
01:43:15,756 --> 01:43:17,758
On day one, I was refused

760
01:43:19,093 --> 01:43:21,095
On day two, she agreed

761
01:43:22,096 --> 01:43:24,372
On day three, she said
I love you

762
01:43:58,566 --> 01:44:00,568
Where has Papa gone?

763
01:44:05,973 --> 01:44:07,975
He has left.
- Where has he gone?

764
01:44:08,075 --> 01:44:09,486
Just drove away

765
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:15,082
He left the cards

766
01:44:18,219 --> 01:44:20,825
Initial shock.
It was bound to happen

767
01:44:23,824 --> 01:44:25,826
Now he's going to ask me
a million questions...

768
01:44:26,093 --> 01:44:28,095
then he'll say, okay

769
01:44:34,602 --> 01:44:36,775
I'm here to take care
of everything

770
01:44:43,544 --> 01:44:46,923
Mr Hudson has arrived from Scotland,
for the presentation

771
01:44:48,482 --> 01:44:51,122
Everything's set.
Come over. Fast

772
01:44:54,555 --> 01:45:00,995
lsha, I have to get to the office.
Important client-meeting

773
01:45:01,495 --> 01:45:04,135
I might have to stay away
for three or four days

774
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:09,144
Our case is very simple!
No problems at all

775
01:45:17,278 --> 01:45:18,154
Later

776
01:45:33,494 --> 01:45:40,173
Ronit was right. Your Papa is going
to be happy, but he'll take his time

777
01:45:44,171 --> 01:45:48,176
To tell you the truth, I've known
Ronit ever since I was a kid

778
01:45:50,344 --> 01:45:55,521
For the first time, I got to know him.
Says, if he wasn't born rich...

779
01:45:56,851 --> 01:46:00,526
he'd have a small,
ramshackle house...

780
01:46:02,189 --> 01:46:06,467
a bit disorganised,
but it'd be lovely

781
01:46:09,196 --> 01:46:13,144
Fights, patch-ups, hopes, despair,
life lived moment by moment

782
01:46:15,135 --> 01:46:17,809
Having everything is so boring,
isn't it Papa?

783
01:46:19,206 --> 01:46:23,154
Oh yes, it was he who
propositioned me. Not I

784
01:46:24,545 --> 01:46:29,153
So now we like the boy,
and the boy's family too

785
01:46:31,685 --> 01:46:35,155
You know Sanya is back home

786
01:46:37,658 --> 01:46:43,438
She wants a divorce from Sukant.
Divorce

787
01:46:46,166 --> 01:46:53,175
If you want my answer
in a word, then it's no

788
01:46:54,708 --> 01:46:59,179
<i>You and Ron“... never</i>

789
01:47:54,234 --> 01:47:56,236
Thanks be to Allah,
he has survived

790
01:47:56,503 --> 01:48:01,179
I keep tell him, London streets
aren't roads in Punjab, don't amble

791
01:48:03,310 --> 01:48:08,123
ls this any way to express anger?
I don't like this approach one bit

792
01:48:09,283 --> 01:48:12,127
Those who shy away from
responsibilities behave like this

793
01:48:12,620 --> 01:48:14,622
What was this? Some crisis?

794
01:48:16,690 --> 01:48:19,728
Ronit just cracked a joke using
his corporate greeting cards

795
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:23,605
I just went along with him to see
what your reaction would be

796
01:48:24,131 --> 01:48:25,940
And I've seen!

797
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:29,147
You run amok in the middle
of the traffic like a kid!

798
01:48:29,570 --> 01:48:32,915
If you're angry, why not take it out
on me? Why on yourself?

799
01:48:41,281 --> 01:48:44,285
There's nothing of the sort
between Ronit and myself

800
01:48:45,152 --> 01:48:49,828
It was only a bit of fun and games
in Bangkok, you know how it is?

801
01:48:50,257 --> 01:48:53,500
Why are you getting so serious?
There was nothing

802
01:48:59,667 --> 01:49:04,912
Look at these keys,
remember what Ma used to say?

803
01:49:18,118 --> 01:49:20,120
Lyingm?

804
01:49:21,655 --> 01:49:23,657
Lying to your Papa?

805
01:49:26,126 --> 01:49:28,470
I've seen through your lie

806
01:49:31,131 --> 01:49:35,477
Oh how will you go through life
with the pain I inflict?

807
01:49:39,139 --> 01:49:46,148
You love your Papa much, don't you?
- Think, what would happen to us...

808
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:49,959
if something happened to you?
What would've become of us?

809
01:49:51,318 --> 01:49:53,320
Understand one thing, my child

810
01:49:56,156 --> 01:50:01,629
They're high-up. You can't
make home with that family

811
01:50:04,164 --> 01:50:07,111
They're my friends.
I know what they intend

812
01:50:09,503 --> 01:50:15,112
I went to Mr Rai seeking
Monishka's hand for Ronit

813
01:50:22,116 --> 01:50:25,654
That's fine. Monishka
is right for Ronit

814
01:50:32,226 --> 01:50:36,140
But I'm with you, Papa.
I swear by Mummy

815
01:50:37,297 --> 01:50:39,140
I swear by you

816
01:50:44,138 --> 01:50:48,484
But first you must promise never to
create a scene like this ever again

817
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:51,948
I'll take that

818
01:50:58,218 --> 01:51:01,825
Look how she's conning me

819
01:51:03,157 --> 01:51:05,103
Papa, look who's here

820
01:51:12,699 --> 01:51:16,511
What have you done Papa?
- Why did you have to tell everyone?

821
01:51:17,104 --> 01:51:20,108
Why? Am I not your daughter?
- Yes, but...

822
01:51:20,541 --> 01:51:24,921
You're behind news. Just see
who's here with us

823
01:51:36,456 --> 01:51:39,130
Uncle JKM sent us tickets to London
and called us over

824
01:51:39,493 --> 01:51:42,497
Along with an appointment letter
in his Dubai offices. On November 1

825
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:47,137
On 30th, we're leaving for Dubai.
- God be praised!

826
01:51:51,338 --> 01:51:53,340
Lalit uncle on the phone for you

827
01:51:56,143 --> 01:51:59,147
Yes Lalit, they're here

828
01:52:00,147 --> 01:52:03,151
Yes, I'm coming over,
I'm bringing lsha along too

829
01:52:14,494 --> 01:52:17,498
All the Gods and Goddesses
have been kind to us

830
01:52:18,232 --> 01:52:21,645
But ever since Lord Shiva
entered our house...

831
01:52:22,102 --> 01:52:24,446
our shares have been soaring

832
01:52:26,106 --> 01:52:33,923
And you visit us on a Monday,
Lord Shiva's day... auspicious day

833
01:52:36,116 --> 01:52:39,723
<i>Where's Ron“?
- Getting dressed</i>

834
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:42,396
He has just returned after
a two-day visit to Scotland

835
01:52:42,589 --> 01:52:46,127
Answer my one question, Uncle Raj!
Whatever you are doing...

836
01:52:46,293 --> 01:52:47,931
is this the right thing to do?

837
01:52:49,162 --> 01:52:51,733
I have no right to choose
my life partner?

838
01:52:54,534 --> 01:52:56,536
I don't accept

839
01:52:57,204 --> 01:53:00,549
Anyone who tries to force me into it,
is an enemy, not a friend

840
01:53:02,142 --> 01:53:04,884
Not your enemy. My friend,
it was a friend of yours...

841
01:53:05,078 --> 01:53:09,754
who finalised this match.
I did it. Am I your enemy?

842
01:53:10,150 --> 01:53:12,152
I don't mean that.
How do I explain to you?

843
01:53:12,352 --> 01:53:18,701
Look son, the family, the background
matter when it comes to marriage

844
01:53:22,095 --> 01:53:24,507
What matters more are
matters of the heart

845
01:53:26,233 --> 01:53:31,114
Cut out my heart and see for yourself
if any other name is writ on it

846
01:53:37,611 --> 01:53:40,114
I don't even want to hear
another name

847
01:53:43,116 --> 01:53:44,925
You must, Uncle Raj

848
01:53:49,656 --> 01:53:54,662
I've never asked you for anything.
Today, I want a promise

849
01:53:57,030 --> 01:53:59,306
Before your parents,
before your uncle...

850
01:53:59,466 --> 01:54:05,075
you will not create a scene.
For my sake, for Sha
ini's sake

851
01:54:48,248 --> 01:54:49,921
Congratulations

852
01:54:58,291 --> 01:55:00,293
Over with the priests

853
01:55:00,861 --> 01:55:06,140
Now get up, meet people.
lsha, show her around

854
01:55:07,801 --> 01:55:11,146
What a choice for Ronit!
- The Rai family is one of...

855
01:55:11,371 --> 01:55:15,148
the top ten families in America.
- How about lunch?

856
01:55:16,009 --> 01:55:20,151
This is the happiest day of my life,
and it's all thanks to you

857
01:55:20,547 --> 01:55:22,549
lam obliged to you.

858
01:55:24,151 --> 01:55:28,964
If Ranvir Rai joins hands with
Malhotras, we can be market leaders

859
01:55:30,157 --> 01:55:32,501
Our shares peak

860
01:55:39,232 --> 01:55:43,681
I like your house, your family,
the atmosphere and particularly...

861
01:55:44,171 --> 01:55:47,550
<i>this interior decoration.
- And Ron“?</i>

862
01:55:48,275 --> 01:55:52,451
I'm not about to tell you that.
That's our secret

863
01:55:56,183 --> 01:56:00,188
Let me show you to your bedroom.
Come on

864
01:56:02,422 --> 01:56:05,130
This jacket looks great on you

865
01:56:10,197 --> 01:56:15,545
Raj, we're giving our daughter away
on your say-so

866
01:56:18,138 --> 01:56:24,612
Monishka is like a daughter to
me too. I shall keep my word

867
01:56:27,147 --> 01:56:31,152
Monishka, I have to be at the gym
at four. I'll call you later

868
01:56:31,551 --> 01:56:34,498
Then we can go out.
- What's the best disco hereabouts?

869
01:56:35,222 --> 01:56:39,170
<i>Ron“ knows about discos. Ask him.
- Where‘ s Ron“?</i>

870
01:56:39,593 --> 01:56:42,164
Should be somewhere around.
Take a look

871
01:57:08,622 --> 01:57:11,125
It's chilly. Put it on

872
01:57:19,199 --> 01:57:21,736
You people are making a fool
out of me!

873
01:57:28,475 --> 01:57:30,682
First put that jacket on

874
01:57:31,645 --> 01:57:33,147
I won't

875
01:57:34,147 --> 01:57:36,753
Okay, first cool down.
Then we'll talk

876
01:57:40,153 --> 01:57:41,962
Go on, tell me

877
01:57:43,156 --> 01:57:45,158
Do you love me?

878
01:57:53,166 --> 01:57:56,170
Never mind, put the jacket on.
Let me help you into it

879
01:57:59,773 --> 01:58:04,188
<i>Look Ron“, give me
a patient hearing</i>

880
01:58:07,814 --> 01:58:11,125
There comes in life,
those moments...

881
01:58:11,551 --> 01:58:13,792
when young hearts
are swayed...

882
01:58:14,187 --> 01:58:17,134
when they fall in love,
when they romance...

883
01:58:19,125 --> 01:58:21,662
without as much as a care...

884
01:58:23,196 --> 01:58:25,142
fOf CONSEQUENCES

885
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:28,804
They begin to believe that...

886
01:58:28,935 --> 01:58:31,609
these romantic fairy-tale
moments are reality.

887
01:58:34,541 --> 01:58:36,817
Something like that
happened to us

888
01:58:39,813 --> 01:58:42,555
It was the right season, the right
atmosphere, the right time

889
01:58:45,218 --> 01:58:48,688
For a while I had forgotten
who I am

890
01:58:52,959 --> 01:58:58,170
So you never were in love?
Was that an infatuation?

891
01:58:59,232 --> 01:59:01,576
You were just swayed?

892
01:59:04,170 --> 01:59:07,777
Ronit you know it.
For me, such romances are...

893
01:59:08,108 --> 01:59:11,385
entertainment, influenced
as it were by films

894
01:59:14,114 --> 01:59:17,926
So you were entertaining me.
You still are...

895
01:59:21,288 --> 01:59:22,926
Look at me...

896
01:59:24,457 --> 01:59:27,131
look at me and tell me,
you don't love me

897
01:59:29,562 --> 01:59:34,807
I love you, I love you very much,
I did ever since my childhood

898
01:59:36,136 --> 01:59:40,141
But only as a friend would,
like a pal

899
01:59:43,343 --> 01:59:46,790
Like a friend... only?

900
01:59:47,681 --> 01:59:48,887
only

901
01:59:50,483 --> 01:59:53,396
Only?
- Yes, only

902
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:03,630
Look at that house...
this is reality

903
02:00:05,098 --> 02:00:10,104
Your Papa, my Papa,
and there's Monishka

904
02:00:12,238 --> 02:00:14,775
I'm telling you,
she's a great girl

905
02:00:24,851 --> 02:00:30,130
And yes, I'm your best friend,
I'll always be

906
02:00:46,139 --> 02:00:50,679
lsha did the right thing.
I know your story

907
02:00:56,349 --> 02:01:04,291
And she says she doesn't love me.
Whom do I fight? How do I fight...

908
02:01:04,524 --> 02:01:06,765
if she's the one...

909
02:01:09,896 --> 02:01:11,637
who's lying

910
02:01:13,099 --> 02:01:16,774
But one day, she will own up,
and she's going to cry

911
02:01:19,139 --> 02:01:25,317
All right, yes it's true,
she is my best friend

912
02:01:32,118 --> 02:01:34,860
Now I'm going to do
exactly what she wants

913
02:02:41,654 --> 02:02:42,997
In hearts...

914
02:02:43,122 --> 02:02:47,468
as it happens
in the world of hearts...

915
02:02:51,197 --> 02:02:57,148
they smile
while their hearts weep

916
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:03,146
Hearts...

917
02:03:04,043 --> 02:03:06,751
no one knows,
no one admits

918
02:03:07,146 --> 02:03:12,425
But don't let anyone know
where it aches secretly

919
02:03:45,585 --> 02:03:51,536
You have betrayed me

920
02:03:52,125 --> 02:03:57,404
Will you ever find loyalty?

921
02:03:58,464 --> 02:04:04,415
You have pained me

922
02:04:04,804 --> 02:04:10,083
How can your pain heal?

923
02:04:24,991 --> 02:04:30,100
Desires rage in my bosom...

924
02:04:31,097 --> 02:04:36,513
like storms rising in sea

925
02:04:37,103 --> 02:04:42,849
Sometimes it's the sailor
who drown his own boat

926
02:04:43,443 --> 02:04:49,121
In the world of hearts,
it happens

927
02:04:49,649 --> 02:04:55,531
We smile, while our hearts weep

928
02:05:06,132 --> 02:05:09,136
What angle is that?
- Triangle

929
02:05:13,206 --> 02:05:16,881
That's Rohit's bedroom. Stay here.
I'll be back after I see him

930
02:05:30,156 --> 02:05:33,831
lsha! Where are you?
- At Ronit's place

931
02:05:34,594 --> 02:05:37,541
I was just knotting my tie, and
I remembered you. Where's Ronit?

932
02:05:37,864 --> 02:05:40,174
Inside.
- I'm going to Mr Rai's...

933
02:05:40,333 --> 02:05:42,335
Papa, I'll talk to you later

934
02:07:16,195 --> 02:07:23,477
Avantika! You're in the nick of time!
Someone bottles up her emotions...

935
02:07:24,604 --> 02:07:30,145
she tries pass up love
saying it's something else...

936
02:07:30,543 --> 02:07:35,151
then the bottled up emotions
break into tears, and truth outs

937
02:07:37,150 --> 02:07:42,156
Oh but lsha doesn't love me,
and that's true too

938
02:07:44,157 --> 02:07:49,664
Because even without me,
lsha can smile, lsha can cry

939
02:07:51,631 --> 02:07:57,638
But love me, lsha can't. Because
even without me, she can live on

940
02:08:00,173 --> 02:08:02,175
Talk to your sister

941
02:08:11,684 --> 02:08:16,360
Then why don't you say you love me?
Why don't you say it?

942
02:08:22,128 --> 02:08:25,598
I love you,
I love you very much

943
02:08:28,134 --> 02:08:31,479
When I was in school, I loved you.
when I was a kid, I loved you

944
02:08:32,138 --> 02:08:34,140
And I love you, still

945
02:08:37,143 --> 02:08:41,148
But you're my friend, aren't you?
How can I be your lover?

946
02:08:45,218 --> 02:08:47,755
It's just that I feel
like crying at times

947
02:08:53,492 --> 02:08:56,166
I'm sorry, I broke down

948
02:09:02,168 --> 02:09:07,447
You're supposed to take Monishka
to Mr Mitta
's for dinner

949
02:09:08,441 --> 02:09:10,443
You don't remember a thing

950
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:16,453
Go on, I'm leaving

951
02:09:53,252 --> 02:09:57,166
Where are you guys?
- Uncle Raj, where are you?

952
02:09:57,523 --> 02:10:02,700
I've got to talk to you.
- I'm seeing Mr Rai at Harry Club

953
02:10:33,559 --> 02:10:39,134
The manager won't let me in.
I need Mr Rai to sign these papers

954
02:10:40,132 --> 02:10:43,477
Let me get them signed for you.
Stay here, I got to talk to you

955
02:11:24,176 --> 02:11:27,714
I just spoke to the manager.
You can go in

956
02:11:28,114 --> 02:11:31,118
You didn't see him?
- There are big guys partying in there

957
02:11:31,517 --> 02:11:33,519
I felt a bit intimidated

958
02:12:42,121 --> 02:12:46,126
Dirty folks.
- One coke, and you think straight

959
02:12:46,659 --> 02:12:49,936
So did you like my in-laws
in foreplay?

960
02:12:50,196 --> 02:12:51,937
What a shame!

961
02:12:54,133 --> 02:12:57,945
So what do you think?
- How are you bothered?

962
02:12:58,571 --> 02:13:01,643
Monishka is entering your family,
not the other way around

963
02:13:06,145 --> 02:13:08,955
You got to do me one last favour

964
02:13:10,082 --> 02:13:12,688
I'm taking Monishka to
Radisson Hampshire tonight

965
02:13:13,085 --> 02:13:17,591
All you got to do
is ask my fiancee 3 questions

966
02:13:19,492 --> 02:13:20,698
3 questions?

967
02:13:21,093 --> 02:13:24,097
So what are your three questions?

968
02:13:26,098 --> 02:13:27,099
Ask her

969
02:13:31,370 --> 02:13:38,845
My child... the first of 3 questions
on behalf of the Malhotra family...

970
02:13:40,112 --> 02:13:47,792
after the wedding, will you live with
Ronit's parents? Or your own home...?

971
02:13:48,187 --> 02:13:50,929
Of course, in my own home.
- After Wedding's done...

972
02:13:51,123 --> 02:13:53,125
what have parents got to do?

973
02:13:58,130 --> 02:14:01,805
And they had better come to see us
after taking an appointment

974
02:14:03,135 --> 02:14:04,876
Parents too?

975
02:14:09,241 --> 02:14:12,814
She's from America. Life out there
is <i>so</i> stressful, <i>so</i> busy

976
02:14:13,879 --> 02:14:16,086
No...?
- My child...

977
02:14:17,082 --> 02:14:25,092
question two is, I hear you like late
night parties, and you come home late?

978
02:14:28,093 --> 02:14:29,902
Nice, nice! So what?

979
02:14:31,564 --> 02:14:36,912
So even after you're married,
it goes on... these late nights?

980
02:14:38,103 --> 02:14:42,449
Getting married doesn't mean
giving up my friends, my independence

981
02:14:43,909 --> 02:14:46,116
After we're married, she can
come and go as she wishes

982
02:14:47,112 --> 02:14:49,854
I don't mind.
Why are you asking these questions?

983
02:14:56,121 --> 02:15:02,128
My third question is, Lalit says
that after the marriage...

984
02:15:02,461 --> 02:15:06,807
we should have a little baby,
like a blossom...

985
02:15:09,134 --> 02:15:13,742
I've already cleared this with Ronit.
I don't want a baby in 4 or 5 years

986
02:15:14,139 --> 02:15:22,149
I don't want to ruin my figure.
- But this is part of our culture

987
02:15:23,148 --> 02:15:26,960
One has duties towards offspring,
towards parents...

988
02:15:27,319 --> 02:15:31,734
Ronit, your uncle seems to belong
to some village in the backwaters

989
02:15:38,530 --> 02:15:41,977
I don't like to have discussions
with small fry like you

990
02:15:42,268 --> 02:15:47,581
To me, you are nothing more than
a marriage broker for the Malhotras

991
02:15:56,181 --> 02:15:57,421
I should be leaving

992
02:16:25,811 --> 02:16:28,621
No one ever did
what you did today

993
02:16:29,248 --> 02:16:32,491
I was fed up of these people,
but how could I tell them?

994
02:16:57,109 --> 02:16:58,782
What are you saying Raj?

995
02:16:59,945 --> 02:17:04,792
It's true. I proposed this marriage.
Now I am trying to break it off

996
02:17:05,184 --> 02:17:07,926
So what are you trying to break off?

997
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:10,522
Ronit's engagement to Monishka

998
02:17:11,023 --> 02:17:16,473
After what I've seen, neither the girl
nor the family is any good for Ronit

999
02:17:17,129 --> 02:17:19,735
We're throwing him in a quagmire
for the money

1000
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:25,148
Raj, I knew one day
your patience will break

1001
02:17:26,138 --> 02:17:30,814
Patience...?
- Before you came here...

1002
02:17:31,310 --> 02:17:37,955
I received a call from Rai about
what you've seen and what reality is

1003
02:17:39,451 --> 02:17:43,160
They are rich folks, Raj.
They have a lifestyle

1004
02:17:43,822 --> 02:17:50,171
They're different. For a middle-class
restaurateur like you....

1005
02:17:51,330 --> 02:17:53,833
all this may be amazing!

1006
02:17:56,168 --> 02:17:59,775
The girl's ideas aren't
compatible with Ronit's.

1007
02:18:00,406 --> 02:18:03,979
Only you are opposed to her, Raj

1008
02:18:06,111 --> 02:18:11,789
Wasn't I always telling you Lalit,
to stay clear of this...

1009
02:18:12,117 --> 02:18:15,462
poor friend of yours? Because
someday or the other...

1010
02:18:15,687 --> 02:18:18,133
he will show you
how petty he is.

1011
02:18:20,125 --> 02:18:23,800
In the truth, Raj and Shalini
always had an eye...

1012
02:18:24,129 --> 02:18:26,735
on your son ever since
he was a boy.

1013
02:18:27,800 --> 02:18:34,149
Ronit was a 50-billion
cheque for them

1014
02:18:36,208 --> 02:18:39,212
But now it's going to Rai

1015
02:18:40,179 --> 02:18:44,423
It was in a fit of enthusiasm, that
he finalised the match with Moniskha

1016
02:18:45,217 --> 02:18:48,164
But it shattered his
daughter lsha's dreams

1017
02:18:48,821 --> 02:18:52,564
<i>She had her eyes trained on Ron“</i>

1018
02:18:53,792 --> 02:18:57,865
Lalit, such was the scheme for
having the engagement annulled...

1019
02:18:58,163 --> 02:19:05,103
in favour of lsha.
But now we all know, yes?

1020
02:19:08,173 --> 02:19:12,781
Want me to show you some photos for
evidence? Would you like to see...

1021
02:19:13,111 --> 02:19:16,786
Ronit's arms snaking over
lsha's waist and all over?

1022
02:19:23,121 --> 02:19:26,796
Were you not my friend
La
it's elder brother...

1023
02:19:27,125 --> 02:19:32,541
were you not the man whom
I respected as my elder...

1024
02:19:34,233 --> 02:19:38,943
then right now...
at this moment...

1025
02:19:40,405 --> 02:19:44,148
I would've slapped you so hard
in the face...

1026
02:19:44,943 --> 02:19:48,948
you'd carry my fingerprints
all your life

1027
02:19:54,686 --> 02:19:57,496
Listen carefully,
Jagdish Malhotra

1028
02:19:59,258 --> 02:20:04,173
lsha and Ronit love each other
very much, very dearly

1029
02:20:05,564 --> 02:20:08,101
But they have imbibed
respect for their elders

1030
02:20:09,434 --> 02:20:13,109
And out of that respect,
because of me...

1031
02:20:14,239 --> 02:20:18,984
they buried their love
and they wiped their tears

1032
02:20:20,379 --> 02:20:23,121
And the photographs
you speak of...

1033
02:20:24,116 --> 02:20:29,122
had they wanted, they could've
made huge blow-ups out of them...

1034
02:20:29,621 --> 02:20:32,465
and plastered them
all over your house

1035
02:20:33,125 --> 02:20:34,627
And then...

1036
02:20:35,360 --> 02:20:40,366
not you, not your father
could've done

1037
02:20:42,134 --> 02:20:44,808
You are crossing the limit, Raj!
- I'm heartbroken...

1038
02:20:45,571 --> 02:20:48,142
heartbroken! Let me have
my say Lalit.

1039
02:20:49,641 --> 02:20:54,488
He has insulted our friendship.
He has insulted my daughter.

1040
02:20:56,148 --> 02:20:58,150
I swear by my mother...

1041
02:20:58,550 --> 02:21:00,427
I swear by Shalini...

1042
02:21:00,752 --> 02:21:03,631
Not I, not my daughter...
will ever enter this house again.

1043
02:21:04,823 --> 02:21:08,100
For us, you are dead... dead

1044
02:21:19,104 --> 02:21:23,849
Forget it, man! You turned out
to be a coward, La
it! Coward!

1045
02:21:24,443 --> 02:21:26,116
My friend, a coward!

1046
02:22:26,972 --> 02:22:31,785
What's this Papa? Tears in your eyes?
Didn't you console me?

1047
02:22:34,112 --> 02:22:36,456
No, this won't do.
Come home

1048
02:22:44,456 --> 02:22:46,458
Loves...

1049
02:22:47,192 --> 02:22:49,138
griefs...

1050
02:22:50,195 --> 02:22:51,799
tales...

1051
02:22:52,130 --> 02:22:54,132
words

1052
02:22:56,134 --> 02:23:00,139
Words are forgotten

1053
02:23:01,640 --> 02:23:06,089
Memories return

1054
02:23:06,778 --> 02:23:11,488
Memories cherished,
of beloved ones...

1055
02:23:12,584 --> 02:23:16,088
return once they're gone

1056
02:23:37,109 --> 02:23:39,487
Sanya, this is Ronit.
Give the phone to lsha

1057
02:23:39,711 --> 02:23:41,315
lsha isn't at home

1058
02:24:02,234 --> 02:24:08,082
lsha, take the phone.
Face the truth

1059
02:24:18,083 --> 02:24:20,359
Listen to me,
listen carefully

1060
02:24:27,092 --> 02:24:29,572
All the VIPs in the world
have been invited

1061
02:24:29,828 --> 02:24:32,707
Come Monday, two big corporates
are going through a merger

1062
02:24:33,098 --> 02:24:35,339
Scions of two great families
will get engaged...

1063
02:24:35,433 --> 02:24:37,845
and the wedding date
will be finalised

1064
02:24:39,104 --> 02:24:41,914
Malhotra and Rai will climb
to number two from number ten

1065
02:24:43,642 --> 02:24:47,385
Here's your engagement ring.
See if it fits your finger

1066
02:24:49,815 --> 02:24:52,295
Come, son.
- Don't call me son, Madam

1067
02:24:52,617 --> 02:24:55,120
Ronit, I am your mother

1068
02:24:56,922 --> 02:24:59,528
You aren't my mother,
my mother you aren't

1069
02:25:01,226 --> 02:25:04,799
You don't even know how grown-up
your son has become...

1070
02:25:05,130 --> 02:25:07,940
have you seen how big
his fingers have grown?

1071
02:25:09,601 --> 02:25:12,138
Because you're one
of those mothers...

1072
02:25:12,470 --> 02:25:15,041
who never held her son's fingers
and taught how to walk

1073
02:25:16,341 --> 02:25:18,343
You've never even taken a
close look at your son,

1074
02:25:18,476 --> 02:25:20,149
never held me to your bosom...

1075
02:25:20,245 --> 02:25:22,486
You never looked into my eyes, never
tried to understand my anguish

1076
02:25:27,385 --> 02:25:29,387
A mother, you aren't

1077
02:25:30,155 --> 02:25:33,159
You're just an executive director
in this marketplace...

1078
02:25:33,959 --> 02:25:36,769
where relationship, emotion,
is laughing matter

1079
02:25:37,562 --> 02:25:43,979
I'm not staying here,
not in a home without a mother

1080
02:25:46,171 --> 02:25:47,980
Without a father...
- Son...

1081
02:25:48,173 --> 02:25:50,983
Don't call me son!

1082
02:25:51,509 --> 02:25:54,183
I'm your mother.
- You are...?

1083
02:25:56,882 --> 02:26:01,194
Then save me, save your son
from the fires...

1084
02:26:01,419 --> 02:26:03,990
that your family wants
to throw me into

1085
02:26:06,291 --> 02:26:08,293
Can you save me?

1086
02:26:09,527 --> 02:26:10,938
You can't

1087
02:26:13,131 --> 02:26:15,133
You can't save me

1088
02:26:33,151 --> 02:26:37,964
For 40 years, I have put my blood,
toil, heart, soul and mind into...

1089
02:26:38,556 --> 02:26:40,695
building these companies.

1090
02:26:41,226 --> 02:26:44,571
I have taken the Malhotra family
into the top ten!

1091
02:26:45,764 --> 02:26:47,766
Now what do you want?

1092
02:26:48,166 --> 02:26:51,079
You want the businesses that have
thrived for years to be ruined?

1093
02:26:51,503 --> 02:26:54,507
You want this house to be turned
into a memorial for lovers?

1094
02:26:55,774 --> 02:26:59,347
<i>This is a business house,
and stays a business house</i>

1095
02:27:00,512 --> 02:27:05,120
If anyone tries to insult me,
if anyone tries to stand in my way...

1096
02:27:05,650 --> 02:27:08,597
I'm going to shoot him!
Then I'll shoot myself

1097
02:27:09,821 --> 02:27:13,826
Anyone who takes sides with Ronit
will be responsible for my death

1098
02:27:15,193 --> 02:27:18,140
ls everyone listening... you hear?

1099
02:28:02,507 --> 02:28:04,282
This boy has rebelled

1100
02:28:38,143 --> 02:28:40,145
I want to see lsha

1101
02:28:49,587 --> 02:28:54,161
Go on... go to him.
He's bleeding

1102
02:29:10,809 --> 02:29:13,483
Yes, what do you want to say?

1103
02:29:31,863 --> 02:29:33,865
Where are you taking me?

1104
02:29:36,634 --> 02:29:39,376
I want to your decision, not verdicts
from the rest of the world

1105
02:29:40,939 --> 02:29:42,941
Are you with me, or not?

1106
02:29:45,643 --> 02:29:47,645
Today, we must take the decision

1107
02:29:49,814 --> 02:29:52,158
Life? Or death?

1108
02:29:55,153 --> 02:29:56,826
Death?
- Yes death

1109
02:30:01,226 --> 02:30:08,644
No, Ronit must be brought back.
- Only one man can compel him...

1110
02:30:09,100 --> 02:30:11,603
to attend tomorrow's function.
- Who?

1111
02:30:12,170 --> 02:30:14,116
Raj. Only Raj

1112
02:30:17,775 --> 02:30:22,724
To save this 500-million corporation,
you must overcome your vanity...

1113
02:30:23,014 --> 02:30:25,016
And beg?
<i>'</i> Maybe, yes

1114
02:30:26,384 --> 02:30:29,126
Please try to understand
how delicate the situation is

1115
02:30:30,121 --> 02:30:32,795
I'm only asking you
to accompany me

1116
02:30:33,525 --> 02:30:37,132
I'll talk to Raj.
You needn't say a word

1117
02:30:39,130 --> 02:30:42,805
Memories cherished, of beloved ones,
return once they're gone

1118
02:30:57,215 --> 02:30:58,216
Sister-in-law...

1119
02:31:00,518 --> 02:31:02,520
Ronit ran away from home, Raj

1120
02:31:07,692 --> 02:31:09,899
Ran away? Where to?

1121
02:31:14,399 --> 02:31:16,106
Run away...?

1122
02:31:17,435 --> 02:31:18,675
He ran away?

1123
02:31:19,170 --> 02:31:21,776
He ran away!
Had to happen!

1124
02:31:23,174 --> 02:31:29,784
Why doesn't Mr Rich ask his 500-million
company to find the boy?

1125
02:31:30,181 --> 02:31:32,627
Find him if you can,
but he can't.

1126
02:31:34,118 --> 02:31:36,120
Let's sit inside and talk

1127
02:31:38,189 --> 02:31:42,934
You folks are his parents.
Parents, period

1128
02:31:45,797 --> 02:31:47,799
You don't rule him

1129
02:31:49,867 --> 02:31:51,869
He's a romantic

1130
02:31:52,403 --> 02:31:55,145
They are lovers.
They love each other

1131
02:31:56,140 --> 02:31:57,813
The lover...

1132
02:31:58,409 --> 02:32:01,151
has flown

1133
02:33:14,986 --> 02:33:16,897
O'Moon

1134
02:33:17,522 --> 02:33:19,524
CYSta rs

1135
02:33:20,091 --> 02:33:22,093
Listen

1136
02:33:25,163 --> 02:33:29,908
I think of you
when I wake, when I sleep

1137
02:33:32,770 --> 02:33:37,116
What's the whole world,
compared to your love?

1138
02:33:58,129 --> 02:34:00,131
I think of you...

1139
02:34:00,298 --> 02:34:05,077
when I wake, when I sleep

1140
02:34:05,470 --> 02:34:10,078
What's the whole world,
compared to your love?

1141
02:35:03,694 --> 02:35:07,801
You and I will love
each other so much

1142
02:35:08,933 --> 02:35:13,143
Anyone who hears will say...

1143
02:35:13,871 --> 02:35:17,148
Who has lived forever?
Who lives forever?

1144
02:35:19,210 --> 02:35:23,488
Love it was,
love it will be

1145
02:35:51,876 --> 02:35:56,188
In your heart,
in my heart...

1146
02:35:57,181 --> 02:36:01,186
let nothing remain unsaid

1147
02:36:02,019 --> 02:36:04,021
Time flows like a river

1148
02:36:04,188 --> 02:36:11,470
Let go of the riverbank,
lest the waters pass us by

1149
02:37:24,201 --> 02:37:28,149
As the girls's father, If I lodge
a complaint with the police...

1150
02:37:28,639 --> 02:37:30,812
you might land in jail

1151
02:37:31,609 --> 02:37:35,955
That's exactly what I intend.
If our families refuse to...

1152
02:37:36,147 --> 02:37:39,151
approbate our love,
let the world decide

1153
02:37:41,152 --> 02:37:45,498
At 5pm today, your engagement to
Monishka will be announced officially

1154
02:37:46,324 --> 02:37:49,168
The papers for the merger of
the two companies will be signed

1155
02:37:50,161 --> 02:37:52,163
Not today, I'm going nowhere

1156
02:37:53,230 --> 02:37:55,176
What if I tell you...

1157
02:38:02,340 --> 02:38:04,616
Your mother is calling

1158
02:39:16,113 --> 02:39:19,720
For the families Malhotra and Rai,
today is a historical day

1159
02:39:20,117 --> 02:39:24,122
Alongwith the merger
of two great corporates...

1160
02:39:24,522 --> 02:39:27,469
two families are also
entering wedlock

1161
02:39:28,859 --> 02:39:33,808
After this ring ceremony,
our children Ronit and Monishka...

1162
02:39:34,131 --> 02:39:36,941
will commit themselves
to a married life together

1163
02:39:37,935 --> 02:39:43,681
Question to the chairman
of our company, Mr JKM

1164
02:39:44,141 --> 02:39:49,420
To whom goes the credit
for this historical day?

1165
02:39:52,416 --> 02:39:54,828
Let me come over to you

1166
02:39:57,154 --> 02:39:58,633
Tell us

1167
02:40:00,291 --> 02:40:02,032
Go on

1168
02:40:03,160 --> 02:40:11,102
Credit goes to all of us.
- All of us? Or just one?

1169
02:40:14,105 --> 02:40:17,109
One...?
I mean, all of us

1170
02:40:18,209 --> 02:40:22,715
A person, without whom, this evening
wouldn't have been made possible?

1171
02:40:24,482 --> 02:40:25,688
Possibly...

1172
02:40:27,118 --> 02:40:28,791
Raj Singh Puri

1173
02:40:34,125 --> 02:40:35,126
Applause

1174
02:40:40,197 --> 02:40:45,476
The man who has tied two corporates,
two children together

1175
02:40:46,337 --> 02:40:48,476
A few words for this man

1176
02:40:55,513 --> 02:40:58,153
Not like that.
Say it with an open heart

1177
02:40:59,150 --> 02:41:01,152
I'm saying it with an open heart

1178
02:41:07,258 --> 02:41:15,109
My brother wants to honour
Raj Singh Puri

1179
02:41:56,140 --> 02:42:01,647
Very magnanimous of him
to honour a small man like myself

1180
02:42:03,314 --> 02:42:08,696
I consider the honour of his family
to be my family honour

1181
02:42:12,423 --> 02:42:17,600
I recall a few lines
my wife once wrote

1182
02:42:20,197 --> 02:42:26,773
When you enter life,
when you leave...

1183
02:42:27,438 --> 02:42:31,909
when you come, bring, and leave
behind, when you leave...

1184
02:42:33,210 --> 02:42:37,124
memories, memories and memories

1185
02:43:34,104 --> 02:43:35,777
Stop Uncle Raj

1186
02:43:37,508 --> 02:43:38,509
<i>STOP</i>

1187
02:43:42,379 --> 02:43:44,381
Just a while longer

1188
02:43:48,185 --> 02:43:51,530
After everyone has made
great speeches...

1189
02:43:53,123 --> 02:43:55,125
the audience is uplifted

1190
02:44:01,699 --> 02:44:05,374
For the first time today,
my mother has encouraged me

1191
02:44:07,071 --> 02:44:09,881
She called me home,
and she told me...

1192
02:44:11,075 --> 02:44:16,821
Son, speak out in public
if it's the truth you speak

1193
02:44:18,515 --> 02:44:21,519
She told me not to hide,
not to resort to lies

1194
02:44:23,187 --> 02:44:29,695
These people who addressed you...

1195
02:44:32,096 --> 02:44:34,702
all of them lied to you

1196
02:44:36,533 --> 02:44:38,535
They lied blatantly

1197
02:44:39,236 --> 02:44:42,706
Because this is a stage,
a public place

1198
02:44:43,774 --> 02:44:47,119
Even Satan speaks with Godlike
dignity from a public stage

1199
02:44:49,446 --> 02:44:51,448
Yes son, you're right

1200
02:44:52,282 --> 02:44:55,126
But you are the society,
the public-at-large

1201
02:44:56,220 --> 02:45:02,933
Remains to be seen which amongst you
supports the truth

1202
02:45:04,461 --> 02:45:06,463
I have a few questions

1203
02:45:07,131 --> 02:45:12,479
Each of you has the merger report,
one side red, the other green

1204
02:45:13,270 --> 02:45:18,618
If I'm wrong, say I'm wrong.
If I'm right, say I'm right

1205
02:45:20,144 --> 02:45:23,148
Don't you say yes,
if I'm lying

1206
02:45:24,148 --> 02:45:28,153
Now give me a few answers

1207
02:45:29,153 --> 02:45:32,623
What is he up to?
- It's a public trial

1208
02:45:35,159 --> 02:45:36,900
My first question

1209
02:45:38,162 --> 02:45:39,573
Apologisinﬂn-

1210
02:45:40,164 --> 02:45:46,581
Apologising for fooling the public
when one's heart is filled with venom?

1211
02:45:58,182 --> 02:46:00,355
Honour. Family honour

1212
02:46:04,188 --> 02:46:07,863
Turning a blind eye
to the fact...

1213
02:46:08,459 --> 02:46:11,133
that greed is the cornerstone
of family honour?

1214
02:46:19,236 --> 02:46:23,810
Culture is the cornerstone of family
honour, Uncle Raj. Not loads of money

1215
02:46:24,141 --> 02:46:30,956
Now, let's turn to a love story.
A girl who is in love...

1216
02:46:31,648 --> 02:46:36,154
sacrifices her love because of a word
she has given to her father

1217
02:46:37,821 --> 02:46:40,165
ls that right?
Or wrong?

1218
02:46:44,228 --> 02:46:48,574
And the boy accedes to his father and
he sells himself on the marketplace

1219
02:46:51,435 --> 02:46:54,973
And his family will force him
to marry a rich heiress...

1220
02:46:55,439 --> 02:46:58,352
to jack up share valuation

1221
02:47:05,182 --> 02:47:09,289
So, this story ends with
the triumph of money. Love loses

1222
02:47:13,123 --> 02:47:20,132
For the happiness of their children,
parents who would sell themselves

1223
02:47:22,299 --> 02:47:27,806
So I heard. Today I see parents selling
their children for their ambitions

1224
02:47:42,286 --> 02:47:46,166
ls this betterment?
ls this progress?

1225
02:47:52,162 --> 02:47:56,577
Emotions, love, friendships,
relationships, culture...

1226
02:47:57,234 --> 02:47:59,976
they mean nothing? Nothing?

1227
02:48:02,339 --> 02:48:09,120
What gospel is this? What gospel
are our elders trying to teach us?

1228
02:48:37,040 --> 02:48:38,314
All right...

1229
02:48:41,144 --> 02:48:42,145
all right

1230
02:48:44,348 --> 02:48:52,165
In a while from now, I'll put
this ring on Monishka's finger

1231
02:48:54,224 --> 02:49:00,505
And I'll sell myself to
this company and Monishka

1232
02:49:04,268 --> 02:49:06,270
But my question is...

1233
02:49:07,437 --> 02:49:12,443
will the wearing of a diamond,
or the performance of some rituals...

1234
02:49:13,543 --> 02:49:15,784
wed two souls?

1235
02:49:18,115 --> 02:49:20,117
ls the union complete?

1236
02:49:20,517 --> 02:49:22,724
Speak.
Give me an answer

1237
02:49:24,121 --> 02:49:26,931
Am I to marry for the sake
of the merger?

1238
02:49:27,591 --> 02:49:30,595
Or should I marry the one I have
given my heart...

1239
02:49:31,495 --> 02:49:33,497
and my life?

1240
02:49:34,131 --> 02:49:35,542
Speak

1241
02:49:36,400 --> 02:49:38,277
Give me an answer

1242
02:49:41,038 --> 02:49:42,949
I shall tell you

1243
02:49:45,142 --> 02:49:49,613
Strange! You cannot answer
Ronit's simple question?

1244
02:49:50,147 --> 02:49:54,152
Because you are a part
of the Globex merger?

1245
02:49:55,152 --> 02:49:59,828
Are you shying away from the truth
under influence of the high and mighty?

1246
02:50:01,158 --> 02:50:08,838
The truth is marriages are meant
to follow hearts, not mergers

1247
02:50:10,801 --> 02:50:15,113
Ronit is right. Diamonds and rituals
don't make a marriage

1248
02:50:15,605 --> 02:50:18,279
Marriage is a meeting
of hearts and souls

1249
02:50:23,747 --> 02:50:26,785
I ask Ronit's true love
to come on stage...

1250
02:50:27,117 --> 02:50:31,463
and in the presence of all of us here,
let her give Ronit this ring

1251
02:51:01,318 --> 02:51:03,161
lsha isn't here

1252
02:51:04,221 --> 02:51:08,761
Today when you wish to insult your
families, you might find...

1253
02:51:09,092 --> 02:51:14,770
Sanya and myself to be part of this.
But not lsha. She has left

1254
02:51:30,447 --> 02:51:32,449
Where is lsha?

1255
02:51:38,722 --> 02:51:42,795
This merger isn't happening.
For the first time...

1256
02:51:43,126 --> 02:51:47,131
these kids have shown me
how good and truthful they are

1257
02:51:48,131 --> 02:51:54,412
And what rogues we are,
you and I in particular

1258
02:52:02,145 --> 02:52:04,751
The worst of scoundrels that they are,
yet they understand what...

1259
02:52:04,881 --> 02:52:09,091
the children mean.
And you are still wondering?

1260
02:52:37,514 --> 02:52:39,516
Why did you leave me?

1261
02:52:39,983 --> 02:52:43,123
You tell me to face the truth
and you run away?

1262
02:52:44,120 --> 02:52:52,130
Nalini told me something was about to
happen on stage. She didn't call you?

1263
02:52:53,530 --> 02:52:58,138
I left before he could do that.
- Why?

1264
02:53:01,471 --> 02:53:08,081
You always said that a girl who isn't
accepted by her husband's family...

1265
02:53:09,880 --> 02:53:12,827
rarely finds respect

1266
02:53:16,486 --> 02:53:19,490
There's more to life than love,
there are other relationships...

1267
02:53:21,658 --> 02:53:24,832
the aunt, the sister-in-law,
the daughter-in-law

1268
02:53:31,535 --> 02:53:33,105
My child...

1269
02:53:33,803 --> 02:53:37,114
for the first time, I have seen the
world through the eyes of my children

1270
02:53:38,208 --> 02:53:41,121
We rise in life,
yet we become so mean.

1271
02:53:42,479 --> 02:53:44,550
And I have risen to such heights...

1272
02:53:44,981 --> 02:53:46,858
that I cannot ask to be forgiven.

1273
02:53:47,584 --> 02:53:49,860
But this much I shall ask of you...

1274
02:53:50,186 --> 02:53:54,532
to marry into my family.
If you do...

1275
02:53:55,458 --> 02:53:58,132
I will understand that
I have been forgiven

1276
02:54:20,984 --> 02:54:22,588
Go...

1277
02:54:23,987 --> 02:54:26,092
he has come to take you away

1278
02:54:27,324 --> 02:54:28,530
Go

1279
02:55:20,210 --> 02:55:25,159
Raj Singh's story doesn't end here.
He stayed a friend to the children...

1280
02:55:25,582 --> 02:55:31,897
to the very end, till the time
he became a grandfather

1281
02:55:38,161 --> 02:55:40,163
Where are you Supriya?

1282
02:55:43,266 --> 02:55:45,712
Supriya is coming out
with me for a walk

1283
02:55:46,169 --> 02:55:50,174
Then she will come home,
she will do her stretch-outs

1284
02:55:51,641 --> 02:55:53,643
then she will take a bath

1285
02:55:53,843 --> 02:55:56,847
Then she will say the prayers,
then I'll take her to school

1286
02:55:58,181 --> 02:56:01,185
And this evening, we're going
somewhere far away

1287
02:56:01,618 --> 02:56:05,794
Where are you, my child?
- I'm here, grandpa

1288
02:56:09,125 --> 02:56:10,866
Where's Avantika, your Mummy?

1289
02:56:11,127 --> 02:56:13,733
Everyone left me all alone.
And they went out for a ride

1290
02:56:18,134 --> 02:56:22,480
Everyone? But I'm here with you,
your grandpa

1291
02:56:23,239 --> 02:56:25,549
Grandpa, will you be my best friend?

1292
02:56:28,211 --> 02:56:29,713
Like Papa-friend?

1293
02:56:33,149 --> 02:56:34,958
Do you hear that?

1294
02:56:36,419 --> 02:56:38,160
This one too...?

1295
02:56:44,294 --> 02:56:48,743
All right, give me your hand.
From now on, I'm your...

1296
02:56:48,965 --> 02:56:50,501
Grandpa-friend

1297
02:56:52,068 --> 02:56:53,843
Let's take a walk

1298
02:56:54,537 --> 02:56:58,485
One minute, let me take
my dear wife's keys

1299
02:57:08,118 --> 02:57:11,463
When did Mummy-Papa get married?
- 6 years ago

1300
02:57:12,122 --> 02:57:15,399
Ronit Uncle and Nisha Aunty?
- Been four years

1301
02:57:16,126 --> 02:57:18,732
When are you getting me
married off?

1302
02:57:20,029 --> 02:57:21,372
Tell me

1303
02:57:28,505 --> 02:57:30,143
Loves...

1304
02:57:30,507 --> 02:57:32,509
griefs...

1305
02:57:33,143 --> 02:57:34,645
tales...

1306
02:57:34,811 --> 02:57:36,484
words

1307
02:57:47,157 --> 02:57:50,627
Words are forgotten

1308
02:57:52,061 --> 02:57:55,167
Memories return

1309
02:58:06,109 --> 02:58:09,522
Memories
