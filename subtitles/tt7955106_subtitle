1
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:37,167
<i>A long time ago</i>,

2
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:45,042
<i>there was a place considered
unreachable to man.</i>

3
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:52,667
<i>On top of a high mountain,</i>

4
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,917
<i>an old sage was meditating.</i>

5
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,667
<i>He had spent his entire life</i>

6
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:05,583
<i>unraveling the mysteries of the universe.</i>

7
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:09,667
<i>Despite gathering a lot of knowledge,</i>

8
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:12,083
<i>he was worried about how</i>

9
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:16,792
<i>he would preserve it</i>

10
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:20,167
<i>for future generations.</i>

11
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:23,167
<i>While he was lost in contemplation, </i>

12
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,625
<i>a vicious snake slowly approached him.</i>

13
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,042
<i>The sage did not like that,</i>

14
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:34,833
<i>and because he could talk to animals,</i>

15
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:38,375
<i>he demanded the snake to leave.</i>

16
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,708
<i>The snake looked at him with an evil grin</i>

17
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,750
<i>and attacked him.</i>

18
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,083
<i>As the old sage was catching his breath,</i>

19
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:33,417
<i>he thanked the majestic animal
who saved him</i>

20
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,000
<i>and appreciated its bravery.</i>

21
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:43,250
<i>The majestic animal introduced itself
as a markhor, a slayer of snakes.</i>

22
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:52,542
<i>The sun soon shone over both of them
as a mark of respect</i>.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,333
<i>And thus began</i>

24
00:02:58,417 --> 00:02:59,750
<i>a bond of friendship.</i>

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,875
<i>The two spent a lot of time together</i>

26
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,375
<i>and introduced each other to their worlds.</i>

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,458
<i>Time went by quickly,</i>

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,792
<i>and the sage soon realized</i>

29
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,042
<i>that his time was going to be up.</i>

30
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:28,167
<i>It was then
that he finally found the answer</i>

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,042
<i>to the question that had plagued him.</i>

32
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,500
<i>The markhor approached his old friend</i>

33
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,958
<i>and reminded him,</i>

34
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,750
<i>"It's time."</i>

35
00:03:41,292 --> 00:03:44,000
<i>The sage stood up</i>

36
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:46,667
<i>and made his way out of the cave</i>

37
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:49,042
<i>for one last time.</i>

38
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:54,542
<i>With the mountains as his witness,
he proclaimed,</i>

39
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:58,500
<i>"Oh, snow-capped peaks, bear witness,</i>

40
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:03,625
<i>for I leave my knowledge
in the hands of this markhor</i>

41
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,792
<i>and the coming generations."</i>

42
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,083
<i>The universe had accepted</i>

43
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,125
<i>that whoever defeats his greatest fears</i>

44
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,542
<i>while saving the life of a markhor,</i>

45
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,333
<i>and possesses a pure heart</i>

46
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,125
<i>will be known as the Protector.</i>

47
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,375
<i>He shall be granted two incredible gifts.</i>

48
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,042
<i>The ability to talk to animals,</i>

49
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:44,875
<i>and the greatest gift of all,
the accumulated knowledge of the sage.</i>

50
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:07,417
Not another word from any of you.

51
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,708
No one's getting out of here alive

52
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,833
unless they complete their homework.

53
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:15,875
Sir?

54
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,625
Shut up!

55
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:23,833
That surprised me!

56
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:26,625
Get back.

57
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,083
Get back.

58
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,292
Let me teach you a lesson.

59
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,458
Darn dog!

60
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,708
Help me.

61
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,083
Help.

62
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,542
Someone get me down.

63
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,500
Help!

64
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,208
What happened to you?

65
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:27,500
Here you go, my little friend.

66
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:28,875
Have some water.

67
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,083
Hey, there!

68
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,500
Where's that girlfriend of yours?

69
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,542
Where do you think you're going?

70
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:54,250
We are not done just yet.

71
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,167
Watch out!

72
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,875
I'll catch up with you later.

73
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:15,583
Hello, Mr. Bablu.

74
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,583
Buy vegetables!

75
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:05,083
Buy carrots and tomatoes!

76
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:38,250
What else did I miss?

77
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,667
Oh, Allahyar's here.

78
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:40,708
Allahyar?

79
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,083
Allahyar?

80
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,833
Allahyar!

81
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:45,625
Are you all right?

82
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:46,583
I'm fine.

83
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,625
Mr. Bablu,

84
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,875
can I have a pack of cookies?

85
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:50,958
There you go.

86
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,000
Thanks.

87
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,333
Hey, what's going on over there?

88
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:05,708
What is it?

89
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,042
Mohsin spotted a leopard!

90
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,167
No way!

91
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,208
Rani!

92
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,958
Super Hunter Allahyar is at your service!

93
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,792
Guess what?

94
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,583
That grumpy old man was very loud today.

95
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:47,875
His spit flew everywhere.

96
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,042
I got him good, though.

97
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,708
He cried like a baby
when he was hung upside down.

98
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:58,708
You can't mess with Allahyar
and get away with it.

99
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,083
Crazy man!

100
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:04,958
Rani,

101
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:06,792
tomorrow is Independence Day.

102
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,750
That means there is no class tomorrow!

103
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:09,833
Yes!

104
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,125
I'm going to put up the biggest flag.

105
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:22,458
He got away.

106
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:23,458
Darn this rat!

107
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:29,542
This thief won't be as lucky next time.

108
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,208
And that's not all, Rani.

109
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,958
He stomped on the flower

110
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:36,542
and pushed me.

111
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll deal with those three.

112
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,333
They think they are really brave.

113
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:42,833
Make sure she learns her lesson well.

114
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:44,500
I'll quiz her later.

115
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:45,875
Dad!

116
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,625
-How are you, my son?
-I'm all right.

117
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,708
How was school?

118
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,708
Same old stuff, nothing new.

119
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:51,750
Really?

120
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,875
So what happened to your teacher today?

121
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:58,542
What happened to him?

122
00:11:58,667 --> 00:11:59,750
Allahyar.

123
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,208
Believe me, Dad.

124
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,083
I don't know what happened.

125
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:04,833
Besides, you know

126
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:06,792
that I only go after small mice,

127
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,000
-not rhinos.
-Have some shame.

128
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,000
Don't disrespect your teachers.

129
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,417
No, I was talking about rhinos,

130
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,792
not my teacher.

131
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
If you give respect,

132
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:16,917
you'll get respect in return.

133
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,125
Yes, but I...

134
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,417
It won't happen again.

135
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,833
Apologize to him tomorrow morning.
All right?

136
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:27,708
-But--
-Allahyar!

137
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,208
As you say, Dad.

138
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,625
You want to buy a flag
when we return, right?

139
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:33,958
Oh, yes!

140
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,375
Dad!

141
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:39,833
I made the most fantastic drawing today.
Do you want to see it?

142
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,292
Of course.

143
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,250
Give me a second.

144
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:45,750
Check this out.

145
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:53,750
Very good, dear.

146
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:55,542
These rockets here,

147
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,917
they are inspired by the F-16.

148
00:12:58,167 --> 00:12:59,333
And here are its computers.

149
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,500
I see.

150
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:01,917
Very nice, dear.

151
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:03,125
Look closely,

152
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,208
it even has rocket boosters.

153
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:07,458
Amazing.

154
00:13:07,542 --> 00:13:09,417
I know you don't like it.

155
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:10,667
What?

156
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:11,833
That isn't true.

157
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,083
I'm just surprised at how amazing it is.

158
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:17,042
I know you are saying that
to make me feel good.

159
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,208
No, really.

160
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:19,875
It's amazing.

161
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,125
Mind-blowing.

162
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:22,958
What happened here?

163
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,250
Nothing.

164
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,208
Aren't we best friends?

165
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:27,458
We are.

166
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,917
Heroes stand their ground

167
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,875
and never back down.

168
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,792
Where there's a will...

169
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,583
There's always a way.

170
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,500
All right.

171
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:44,750
It's time for work.

172
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,792
But tomorrow's a holiday.

173
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,083
Come on, take a day off.

174
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:50,000
I cannot do that.

175
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,917
I'm responsible
for protecting the animals.

176
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,417
You have to be honest in...

177
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,750
...your job. I know.

178
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,333
All right, finish your homework.

179
00:13:57,917 --> 00:13:59,208
But it's a holiday tomorrow.

180
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,000
You'll kill me with all this work.

181
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,333
No need to be so dramatic, Allahyar.

182
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,750
Go finish it.

183
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,542
I hate homework!

184
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,500
I'm leaving!

185
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:11,750
I'm just a kid.

186
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,333
Cut me some slack.

187
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,250
Homework!

188
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:16,792
I'm sick of it.

189
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:22,292
Right, goodbye.

190
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:28,958
What's wrong?

191
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:30,375
Are you not enjoying the story?

192
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,083
No.

193
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,042
Not really.

194
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,083
I thought this was your favorite story?

195
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,667
It used to be when I was a little boy.

196
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,792
-But I am no longer a little boy.
-So are you a little girl, then?

197
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,458
<i>THE PROTECTOR
STORY OF A HERO</i>

198
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:48,417
Dad.

199
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,583
If you think about it,

200
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:51,125
the story is pretty stupid.

201
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:53,333
How will the Protector protect anything?

202
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,000
And with such lame powers?

203
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:56,250
Yes, but--

204
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,917
How is being able to talk to animals

205
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,250
going to help him in a fight?

206
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,333
-Oh, no--
-If he had money,

207
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:02,542
gold,

208
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,083
or a magical sword,

209
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,208
it would have been fantastic.

210
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,250
All right.

211
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,333
Forget it, get some sleep.

212
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,000
Although...

213
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:13,333
the part with the dragon

214
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:14,417
is pretty awesome.

215
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:16,958
You know, Dad...

216
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,458
You look just like the hero of the story.

217
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:21,250
Just like...

218
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,542
Shaan, the actor.

219
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:28,625
Can you stop flattering me?

220
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,625
What?

221
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,750
Forget about that.
Did you finish your homework?

222
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:36,875
Yes.

223
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:38,583
All right, go to sleep now.

224
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:40,917
Say a prayer before you sleep.

225
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:41,875
Good night.

226
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,875
Good night, Dad.

227
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,208
Dad.

228
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:47,333
Don't close the door.

229
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:48,833
All right, I won't.

230
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,500
What are you doing here?

231
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:32,083
Allahyar.

232
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:34,500
Dad, look here.

233
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:36,000
Someone left their goat.

234
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,583
That isn't a goat.

235
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:45,125
-It's a markhor.
-A markhor?

236
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:48,958
Dad,

237
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,625
they are worth a lot, right?

238
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:52,708
We can sell it

239
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,167
and then we'll get a lot of money.

240
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,042
This animal represents our country.

241
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:02,375
Selling it would be like
selling our country.

242
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,542
This has to be the work of poachers.

243
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:11,000
You're a good boy.

244
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,000
Don't be scared. I'm your friend.

245
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,417
-All right?
-Just so you know, it's a girl.

246
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,000
All right, give me a hand.

247
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,167
Let's take her inside.

248
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,125
Dad?

249
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,875
Are hunters bad people?

250
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:27,417
One should only hunt for food,

251
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,958
and not for entertainment,
adventure, or business.

252
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:32,583
Let's go.

253
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,083
You're a good girl.

254
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:39,250
Don't be scared, everything will be fine.

255
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:47,750
Dad?

256
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:50,375
Wake up!

257
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,083
Dad! What happened?

258
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:53,542
Dad?

259
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:54,708
Dad!

260
00:19:56,792 --> 00:19:57,917
Please wake up!

261
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:02,292
Dad!

262
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:23,958
Let me go!

263
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,208
Dad!

264
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,375
What's so funny?

265
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,125
Bablu.

266
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:54,583
Let me guess.

267
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,083
You're thinking about the kid, aren't you?

268
00:20:58,417 --> 00:20:59,250
I...

269
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,875
I know him.

270
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,333
He's an innocent kid.

271
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:07,375
Why didn't you tell me

272
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:08,958
that you knew him?

273
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,292
Go. Go on.

274
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,375
Let him out

275
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,375
and send him home.

276
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,875
Why did you kidnap him in the first place?

277
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:16,583
Go already.

278
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,500
At this deserted place?

279
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,208
Get back here!

280
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:22,875
You will let him go?

281
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:24,833
Are you mad?

282
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:26,667
Try using that brain of yours!

283
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,083
He knows you?

284
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:29,167
Do you want to go to jail?

285
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,500
Tell me, do you want to?

286
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,958
His dad's a ranger

287
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,500
and he knows you.

288
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,667
Why didn't you finish him off?

289
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,750
"I know him."

290
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,208
What an idiot!

291
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:52,167
He's just a kid.

292
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:54,417
We can't kill him.

293
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:55,375
Hey!

294
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:57,000
You know what?

295
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,292
Adopt the brat.

296
00:21:58,833 --> 00:21:59,833
What are you doing?

297
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,583
Mani!

298
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:02,708
What are you doing?

299
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:03,875
Take the wheel!

300
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,125
Mani!

301
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:06,167
Take the wheel!

302
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,875
Mani!

303
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:08,542
Bablu, look!

304
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:11,000
Thanks to this piece of meat,

305
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:14,042
tomorrow, you and I
will be rolling in cash.

306
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:15,667
Look at that,

307
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,417
it can already see its end.

308
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:18,833
Are you scared?

309
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:21,333
Tomorrow, a butcher will make

310
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:23,750
minced meat out of you.

311
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,375
And pretty soon, you'll be cooked

312
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,042
and served on a platter!

313
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:33,958
Are you dead?

314
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,333
Are you dead or alive?

315
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,458
Looks like the brat is dead, Bablu.

316
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:45,917
All right.

317
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:47,625
I'm just messing around.

318
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:48,750
All right, listen up.

319
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,750
Pick up the hunter
from the airport tomorrow.

320
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:53,042
We will be taking him on a hunt.

321
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,500
Can you guess what we will hunt?

322
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,500
The markhor with the biggest horns!

323
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:00,958
We will earn American dollars, baby.

324
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:03,958
Grab the keys.

325
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,292
Lock them up in the storage room.

326
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,500
I need to take a leak.

327
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,500
Bablu!

328
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:12,333
Get him!

329
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:16,917
Bablu!

330
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,208
Ouch, that hurts.

331
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,000
-Allahyar.
-No!

332
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,000
My dear.

333
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:45,833
Allahyar, listen to me.

334
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:00,000
<i>Where there's a will,</i>

335
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:05,125
<i>there's always a way.</i>

336
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:47,708
Allahyar!

337
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:49,042
Grab my hand.

338
00:26:49,417 --> 00:26:50,250
Hurry up!

339
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:55,500
Get down there and get him.

340
00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:21,917
Why are you standing there?

341
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,250
<i>Do something!</i>

342
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:56,583
Come on!

343
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:11,792
What else could you have done?

344
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:14,292
You gave your all.

345
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:17,958
It's not our fault
that he wanted to take his own life.

346
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:19,708
But Mani--

347
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:21,333
That poor kid was suicidal.

348
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:24,125
It's a good thing
that he is not here anymore.

349
00:28:26,292 --> 00:28:27,167
What?

350
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:29,917
If a horse befriends grass,
it will die from starvation!

351
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:34,750
Look, in order to get rich,

352
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:36,750
some sacrifices have to be made.

353
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,458
Don't you want to roll in cash?

354
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:41,125
Of course, I do!

355
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:43,125
But not by crossing the line!

356
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:46,375
There's a difference between
hunting and murder!

357
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,708
No, there isn't!

358
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:50,125
That's what you don't understand.

359
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:51,750
It's a life,

360
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:53,875
be it a person or an animal.

361
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:55,250
It's all the same.

362
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:57,208
Prey is still prey.

363
00:28:58,792 --> 00:28:59,750
You're wrong, Mani.

364
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:01,250
He was just an innocent kid.

365
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:04,292
He had his entire life ahead of him.

366
00:29:05,792 --> 00:29:06,917
Wasn't that markhor a kid, too?

367
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,125
Wasn't it?

368
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:09,208
Tell me.

369
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,833
There is no point in crying now, though.

370
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:16,667
Mani? What are you doing?

371
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,917
My dear friend...

372
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:21,792
We can't let the Nawab leave
hungry now, can we?

373
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:24,875
That meat isn't going to walk back up.

374
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:50,250
All right.

375
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:52,250
That's enough!

376
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:13,500
Dad.

377
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:17,667
Okay, come here.

378
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:19,333
Let's go home! Come.

379
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:20,542
Hurry up.

380
00:30:21,792 --> 00:30:22,792
No! I won't.

381
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:24,542
What do you mean? Why not?

382
00:30:31,167 --> 00:30:32,250
You're talking.

383
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,875
So?

384
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:42,583
What is it? The hunter?

385
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,750
No, that goat...

386
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:56,708
What's your problem?

387
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:58,083
-You...
-Me?

388
00:30:58,542 --> 00:31:00,167
-You're...
-I'm Mehru.

389
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,792
You're talking!

390
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:03,083
Yes, so?

391
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,083
You can talk?

392
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:05,875
No! I'm mute.

393
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,375
Did you hit your head?

394
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:08,292
But...

395
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:10,083
Wait, you can understand me?

396
00:31:11,042 --> 00:31:11,958
No way!

397
00:31:13,042 --> 00:31:14,583
I didn't know monkeys could talk.

398
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:15,708
A monkey?

399
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:17,833
Maybe I'm imagining this.

400
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,667
My name

401
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,875
is

402
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,833
Mehru!

403
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,208
The poor monkey might have hurt his head.

404
00:31:27,292 --> 00:31:28,167
Hey, you goat!

405
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:29,750
I'm not a monkey!

406
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:32,833
And I'm a markhor, you monkey!

407
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,167
Same thing.

408
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:37,250
Madam!

409
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:38,667
You're going the wrong way!

410
00:31:39,042 --> 00:31:40,458
My home is this way.

411
00:31:40,542 --> 00:31:41,417
Sia Koh.

412
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:42,792
And that's where I'll be going!

413
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:45,000
By yourself?

414
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,333
Of course!

415
00:31:46,417 --> 00:31:47,417
I'm a markhor.

416
00:31:47,542 --> 00:31:49,292
I don't need a monkey to protect me!

417
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,375
Protect...

418
00:31:51,292 --> 00:31:53,083
The Protector!

419
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:54,833
I'm the Protector! See?

420
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:56,125
What?

421
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:57,208
The Protector!

422
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:59,875
The one who saves a markhor,

423
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,208
has a pure heart,

424
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:03,875
and conquers his fears

425
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:06,333
will have the ability to talk to animals!

426
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,458
He'll be known as the Protector,

427
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:09,500
and that's me.

428
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:10,583
Great, let's go.

429
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:11,500
Where?

430
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:12,667
To stop those hunters

431
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:14,917
and protect the markhors!

432
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,167
-Me?
-Yes.

433
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:17,625
I'm supposed to stop the hunters?

434
00:32:18,792 --> 00:32:20,458
But they have guns.

435
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:21,792
If you are the Protector,

436
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:24,500
and that hunter wants to hurt my father--

437
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:25,792
I get that.

438
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:27,333
But my dad is a forest ranger,

439
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:28,750
he'll get those hunters!

440
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:30,625
So come with me.

441
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:31,708
Fine.

442
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:32,750
You keep making excuses,

443
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:33,833
I'll be fine on my own.

444
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:34,750
Wait!

445
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:36,792
The hunters.

446
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:38,375
And

447
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,458
this wilderness...

448
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:42,500
Don't worry.

449
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:44,542
If you're too scared...

450
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:45,917
I'm not scared.

451
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:47,083
Don't cut me off.

452
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:49,000
I can't let you go on your own!

453
00:32:50,042 --> 00:32:51,042
Because I am...

454
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:52,708
Allahyar!

455
00:32:53,792 --> 00:32:55,458
The protector of the markhors!

456
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:07,750
Shall we?

457
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,083
Wait!

458
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,167
Darn it!

459
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:15,167
You know,

460
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:20,167
if you want to go home...

461
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,583
You can come back later with your dad.

462
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:36,667
My dad.

463
00:35:48,042 --> 00:35:48,917
My dad.

464
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
He always says that

465
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:59,750
heroes never give up on a problem!

466
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:04,792
My dad says the same thing.

467
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,500
My dad is very brave.

468
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,875
He's the clan leader.

469
00:36:13,542 --> 00:36:14,958
He's my best friend

470
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:16,917
and I'm his favorite!

471
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:20,625
But that's a secret!

472
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:23,667
My sisters don't know that.

473
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:31,458
If I had only listened to him,

474
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:34,542
all this could have been avoided.

475
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:39,958
But I went too far from home,

476
00:36:40,042 --> 00:36:43,208
and now that hunter knows where we live.

477
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,833
That's it!

478
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,542
I won't let him come near my family!

479
00:36:56,792 --> 00:36:57,625
Yes.

480
00:36:59,292 --> 00:37:00,125
Let's go.

481
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:32,958
Where's the markhor?

482
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:51,167
This seems to be the right way.

483
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:53,500
Maybe you're right.

484
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:55,083
But how would a monkey...

485
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,542
I mean, a human.

486
00:37:57,625 --> 00:38:00,042
How would a human know anything
about the jungle?

487
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:01,292
It's probably this way.

488
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:03,667
Of course, you're right.

489
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:05,125
How would a human know about it?

490
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,333
But I'm sure a wild animal knows!

491
00:38:07,792 --> 00:38:09,250
Monkeys are wild, too!

492
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:11,250
Fine, then!

493
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,042
Find a wild animal like yourself,

494
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,667
and save your dad on your own!

495
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:36,500
It's all right.

496
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:38,625
Here.

497
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:39,833
This is for you.

498
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:47,792
Delicious!

499
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:52,042
My love, where are you off to?

500
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:55,125
My love...

501
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:08,208
Your walk is so alluring.

502
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:09,792
Your soft,

503
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:13,625
scaly skin...

504
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:15,083
It drives me wild.

505
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:16,375
Oh, so wild!

506
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:20,417
Your hair is as beautiful
as that of an old woman.

507
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,875
Eyes as...

508
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:26,750
Sweetheart?

509
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,875
Love?

510
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:29,792
Love?

511
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:31,875
Love?

512
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:51,125
Did he see us?

513
00:39:53,417 --> 00:39:54,292
He did.

514
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,417
Will you be my friend?

515
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:08,083
If you can tell us the way to Sia Koh,

516
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:09,708
we will both be your friend.

517
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:10,792
Hey, monkey!

518
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:13,042
I'd rather have my thumb be your friend!

519
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:14,042
What?

520
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:17,542
Mister...

521
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:18,625
What? "Mister"?

522
00:40:20,542 --> 00:40:22,000
We're trying to stop a hunter.

523
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:28,375
He's trying to kill my dad.

524
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:29,750
And,

525
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:33,333
we don't even know the way to Sia Koh!

526
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:38,625
You look even more beautiful when you cry!

527
00:40:40,542 --> 00:40:42,042
I'll take you to Sia Koh myself.

528
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:45,542
And I'll teach that hunter a lesson,

529
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:47,167
so that he'll realize that

530
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,625
you're under the protection of Hero,

531
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:49,708
the mixed martial artist!

532
00:40:50,792 --> 00:40:52,125
-Look, mister.
-Yes, miss?

533
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:56,625
Allahyar!

534
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,792
-Bye!
-You don't need to worry, my love.

535
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,625
You stupid owl!

536
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:03,333
I'm Chakor, not an owl.

537
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:06,042
If we follow this fool, it's game over.

538
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:07,000
Let's calm down.

539
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:09,208
I mean, why lie if you don't know?

540
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,292
Just admit it!

541
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:12,667
You can fly if you fall from the cliff,
but what about her?

542
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,750
Wait a minute!

543
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:15,125
You can fly?

544
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:19,500
Why don't you just fly over there
and warn my family?

545
00:41:19,792 --> 00:41:20,958
Every dog and cat can fly.

546
00:41:21,042 --> 00:41:21,917
What?

547
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:26,125
He got into a big fight with wild cats.

548
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:31,708
So his hand broke!

549
00:41:33,917 --> 00:41:34,875
He can only walk.

550
00:41:35,542 --> 00:41:37,000
Hey! You bundle of lies!

551
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:38,042
Where?

552
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,375
My teacher told me
that liars have tiny brains,

553
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,500
but it looks like his is missing!

554
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,292
Thanks for the offer,
but I think we can manage.

555
00:41:46,917 --> 00:41:47,917
Sia Koh?

556
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:49,917
I was talking about Sialkot!

557
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,917
I've seen markhors there with my own eyes.

558
00:41:54,667 --> 00:41:56,667
A beautiful place, you know.
Sia Koh is this way.

559
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,583
-No!
-Let's go.

560
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,792
Stop! Forget it! Hero?

561
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:09,417
<i>Be my companion</i>

562
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:14,125
<i>All these sights are only for you</i>

563
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:16,958
<i>And these paths</i>

564
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:21,750
<i>Will sing along with us </i>

565
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:24,750
<i>There is no fear</i>

566
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:28,958
<i>Nor any regret</i>

567
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:32,875
<i>My courage has awakened</i>

568
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:37,042
<i>I just want to keep moving forward</i>

569
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:44,375
<i>We are travelers
And the destination is still far ahead</i>

570
00:42:45,417 --> 00:42:51,375
<i>My friend
Do not be afraid of such troubles</i>

571
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:58,958
<i>Your day shall come tomorrow</i>

572
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:05,500
<i>There is no fear</i>

573
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,708
<i>Nor any regret</i>

574
00:43:10,042 --> 00:43:13,083
<i>My courage has awakened</i>

575
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:17,417
<i>I just want to keep moving forward</i>

576
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:25,708
<i>We are travelers
And the destination is still far ahead</i>

577
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:33,417
<i>My friend
Do not be afraid of such troubles</i>

578
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:41,125
<i>Your day shall come tomorrow</i>

579
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:06,708
A leaf.

580
00:44:17,792 --> 00:44:18,625
What's wrong?

581
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:20,458
Nothing.

582
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:23,333
Why do you want to kill us?

583
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:24,458
Me?

584
00:44:24,667 --> 00:44:26,167
I mean humans.

585
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:28,708
Being a hunter

586
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,375
is considered an act of bravery.

587
00:44:30,708 --> 00:44:32,292
And one needs skill to be a marksman.

588
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:37,125
It would be considered an act of bravery
if we shot back.

589
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:39,250
You can always practice on a rock.

590
00:44:39,333 --> 00:44:40,208
Am I right?

591
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:41,583
Yes.

592
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:43,458
Others do it for self-defense,

593
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:46,542
while others hunt for food.

594
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:47,500
Self-defense?

595
00:44:47,583 --> 00:44:49,375
Why? Are we the ones trying to kill them?

596
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:50,625
No.

597
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,250
But, what if a lion suddenly...

598
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:54,333
Got hungry?

599
00:44:54,542 --> 00:44:56,250
Can't he be satisfied with
fruits and vegetables?

600
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:57,167
Well, yes.

601
00:44:57,458 --> 00:44:59,042
You have a point.

602
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,125
Sia Koh.

603
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:02,417
An unusual name, right?

604
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:03,833
"Sia" means "black."

605
00:45:04,292 --> 00:45:05,292
"Koh" means "mountain."

606
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:06,542
Black. Like the color, right?

607
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:07,958
Then why not call it "Black Mountain"?

608
00:45:08,042 --> 00:45:09,042
You should not do that!

609
00:45:17,917 --> 00:45:18,750
Hero.

610
00:45:19,042 --> 00:45:19,875
Stop fooling around!

611
00:45:19,958 --> 00:45:20,792
Let's move!

612
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:22,125
We've wasted enough time.

613
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:26,375
What is it?

614
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:35,542
We should get out of here.

615
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:37,375
I agree.

616
00:45:39,792 --> 00:45:40,792
Wolves!

617
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:46,125
Quiet!

618
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:48,208
Boss!

619
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:50,125
Boss.

620
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:51,375
Can I eat him?

621
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,000
Forget about him,

622
00:45:54,917 --> 00:45:55,917
look at what's behind him.

623
00:45:57,042 --> 00:45:57,958
A goat.

624
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:01,708
Yes, she might look thin,

625
00:46:02,458 --> 00:46:03,708
but she is quite chubby.

626
00:46:03,792 --> 00:46:04,667
Hero!

627
00:46:06,667 --> 00:46:08,250
She isn't a goat. She's a markhor.

628
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,625
You are a...

629
00:46:13,167 --> 00:46:14,708
-Let's not get personal here.
-Markhor.

630
00:46:15,917 --> 00:46:16,917
Looks very tasty.

631
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:17,833
Be quiet!

632
00:46:17,917 --> 00:46:18,958
Of course, whatever you say.

633
00:46:20,625 --> 00:46:22,208
All of you better be quiet.

634
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:28,500
I must applaud your bravery

635
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:31,083
for venturing out
in this hostile environment.

636
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:37,000
Finding food is difficult,

637
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:42,125
but you came right to us.

638
00:46:42,917 --> 00:46:44,792
Absolutely, you said it!

639
00:46:45,917 --> 00:46:47,792
Actually, we were just about to head back.

640
00:46:49,958 --> 00:46:51,458
What did you think would happen?

641
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:53,958
Oh, yes! What were you thinking?

642
00:46:54,167 --> 00:46:55,458
Stop interrupting me!

643
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,875
How many times have I told you

644
00:46:57,958 --> 00:46:58,792
that when I'm...

645
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,500
Just one word from me,

646
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:10,417
and Daplu and Taplu will rip you apart.

647
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,875
Boss, what is wrong with your voice?

648
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:14,375
You pumpkin head!

649
00:47:14,792 --> 00:47:16,125
How many times do I have to say it?

650
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,917
When I'm talking,

651
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:20,042
do not interrupt me!

652
00:47:20,292 --> 00:47:21,833
I've got a sore throat.

653
00:47:21,917 --> 00:47:23,417
You guys made me howl...

654
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,500
I did that all night long!

655
00:47:36,208 --> 00:47:38,833
Boss, our food!

656
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:40,625
After them!

657
00:47:40,792 --> 00:47:41,667
Run!

658
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:18,875
Forget it, boss.

659
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:22,083
Salt raises our blood pressure, anyway.

660
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:24,958
Boss.

661
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:26,875
Can I eat him?

662
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,625
Get him, boss! Get him!

663
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:33,333
Teach him a lesson. Grab him by his tail.

664
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:42,583
It's so dark, I can't see a thing.

665
00:49:46,042 --> 00:49:47,042
I'm really tired.

666
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:48,208
Oh, really?

667
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,125
Did you get tired of sitting?

668
00:49:50,542 --> 00:49:51,542
I'm tired.

669
00:49:51,917 --> 00:49:52,917
Stop, please.

670
00:49:53,583 --> 00:49:54,625
I'm tired.

671
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:55,708
Eat something.

672
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:57,292
Your bones are pricking me.

673
00:49:58,125 --> 00:49:59,375
Do you have bones or needles?

674
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:02,417
What are you laughing at?

675
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:03,417
Dumb monkey.

676
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:05,667
He's gone blind.

677
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:08,708
The tree was standing there,
and the monkey went straight into it.

678
00:50:58,083 --> 00:50:58,958
What is it?

679
00:51:06,583 --> 00:51:07,667
Allahyar, get up!

680
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:09,250
Hurry up!

681
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:10,500
This is a dangerous animal!

682
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:11,958
Have you all gone mad?

683
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:14,417
How dare you say such things about me?

684
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,458
Just wait and see.

685
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:17,000
Do you even know who I am?

686
00:51:17,083 --> 00:51:18,083
I'm a snow leopard!

687
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:19,542
I rule this land.

688
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:23,000
I am your king and you are my servants!

689
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:31,542
Crazy goat.

690
00:51:31,625 --> 00:51:32,958
Prepare yourself!

691
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:35,917
See how Lord Chakku will deal with you!

692
00:51:36,458 --> 00:51:39,292
Does your mommy know where Lord Chakku is?

693
00:51:39,792 --> 00:51:40,958
If you have the guts,

694
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:42,458
then bring it on.

695
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,917
I'm not a goat, I'm a markhor!

696
00:51:45,292 --> 00:51:48,500
I know how to deal with your kind!

697
00:51:56,167 --> 00:51:57,583
You...

698
00:51:57,792 --> 00:51:59,417
You fat cow!

699
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,333
Let's go.

700
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,042
What kind of protector am I?

701
00:52:04,417 --> 00:52:07,542
Be careful, this kitten might scratch you.

702
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,042
Hey, chicken. Who did you call a kitten?

703
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:11,125
You're a scaredy-cat!

704
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,583
Show me some respect,

705
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:14,875
or else I'll eat you!

706
00:52:14,958 --> 00:52:16,292
Don't mess with me, understand?

707
00:52:16,583 --> 00:52:17,833
Isn't he cute?

708
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:19,708
No?

709
00:52:21,167 --> 00:52:22,500
Get your eyes checked.

710
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:24,958
You're calling this ugly beast "cute"?

711
00:52:25,083 --> 00:52:26,083
Right.

712
00:52:26,333 --> 00:52:27,417
He is really ugly.

713
00:52:28,792 --> 00:52:30,333
Don't waste my time.

714
00:52:30,417 --> 00:52:31,917
We need to get home
before the hunter does.

715
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:32,875
Stop!

716
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:34,750
Tell me where you're going

717
00:52:34,875 --> 00:52:35,792
this instant!

718
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:37,625
We're going to stop a hunter.

719
00:52:38,292 --> 00:52:39,417
-Mehru's dad--
-Allahyar.

720
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,500
-What?
-Be quiet!

721
00:52:40,917 --> 00:52:42,583
Draw him a map while you're at it,

722
00:52:43,042 --> 00:52:45,875
so it will be easier for him to hunt us.

723
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:52,208
My friends are naive,

724
00:52:52,958 --> 00:52:55,500
they don't know about your kind.

725
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,958
But I am a markhor!

726
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,375
I know exactly how evil your kind is!

727
00:53:00,667 --> 00:53:03,417
If I see you again,
you'll be screaming in agony!

728
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,375
Understand?

729
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:30,083
Poop.

730
00:53:46,917 --> 00:53:48,417
Roast wolf.

731
00:53:48,583 --> 00:53:49,417
Boss.

732
00:53:50,792 --> 00:53:51,958
Can I eat it?

733
00:53:52,042 --> 00:53:54,625
He's talking about you, idiot.

734
00:53:55,958 --> 00:53:57,208
Yes! You are an idiot.

735
00:54:07,417 --> 00:54:08,292
Boss?

736
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:13,417
Watch your back,

737
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,167
he might be a hunter.

738
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:16,083
A hunter?

739
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:18,125
Is he one of them?

740
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:19,750
They are ruthless.

741
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:21,750
Absolutely ruthless.

742
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:22,958
Boss.

743
00:54:23,042 --> 00:54:24,667
I'm not scared, not at all.

744
00:54:27,292 --> 00:54:29,667
Don't let him escape.

745
00:54:41,542 --> 00:54:42,375
Wait!

746
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:42,417
You will pay for this.

747
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:44,792
Hunter.

748
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:07,125
Did he fall for it?

749
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:10,208
He took the bait.

750
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,417
Anytime now.

751
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,208
Now, I'll teach this beast a lesson
for following us.

752
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:15,500
"This beast"?

753
00:56:15,583 --> 00:56:16,625
Yes! He's a beast!

754
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:18,042
Listen,

755
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,542
you live in a fool's paradise.

756
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:21,125
You know nothing about animals like him.

757
00:56:21,208 --> 00:56:22,292
I live in a fool's paradise?

758
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,500
What I mean is,

759
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:24,500
you are naive.

760
00:56:24,833 --> 00:56:25,708
Naive.

761
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:26,792
It means you're stupid.

762
00:56:27,042 --> 00:56:27,958
The dumb kind.

763
00:56:34,917 --> 00:56:36,167
What were you thinking?

764
00:56:36,542 --> 00:56:38,667
That we wouldn't be aware
of your conniving ways?

765
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
How does it feel?

766
00:56:40,208 --> 00:56:42,083
The hunter has become the hunted!

767
00:56:43,167 --> 00:56:45,083
What are you going on about, you fat cow?

768
00:56:45,292 --> 00:56:46,375
I'll make you regret this!

769
00:56:46,958 --> 00:56:47,833
Fat?

770
00:56:48,042 --> 00:56:50,417
Yes, you're too fat for my taste.

771
00:56:50,667 --> 00:56:52,833
I'll hurt so bad, you will cry.

772
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:54,208
The one who will be crying is you

773
00:56:54,375 --> 00:56:55,708
when you are left hanging here!

774
00:56:55,917 --> 00:56:57,500
Get me down this instant,

775
00:56:57,625 --> 00:56:59,000
or else you will face my wrath.

776
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,875
Looks like the kitten is trying
to scare you, Protector.

777
00:57:04,042 --> 00:57:05,333
Actually, the monkey is a coward.

778
00:57:08,917 --> 00:57:09,792
Listen,

779
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:11,667
if you can find something else to hunt

780
00:57:11,875 --> 00:57:13,500
and stop following us,

781
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I'll let you go.

782
00:57:15,583 --> 00:57:19,042
I don't eat trash, don't flatter yourself.

783
00:57:19,167 --> 00:57:22,625
I'm following you
so that I can get revenge on that hunter.

784
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:23,625
Revenge?

785
00:57:23,792 --> 00:57:24,792
What for?

786
00:57:24,917 --> 00:57:25,917
Let me...

787
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:40,750
He's horrible, he killed my parents

788
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:42,875
and broke my leg!

789
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:45,542
I won't forgive him!

790
00:57:45,875 --> 00:57:46,708
Who?

791
00:57:46,792 --> 00:57:47,792
The hunter, who else?

792
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,375
He killed my parents,
I'll have my revenge!

793
00:57:51,667 --> 00:57:52,667
He's a monster!

794
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:01,167
Come.

795
00:58:01,792 --> 00:58:03,042
We're going to stop the hunter.

796
00:58:03,375 --> 00:58:05,208
-You can join us.
-Allahyar!

797
00:58:05,417 --> 00:58:06,500
He cannot come with us!

798
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:09,250
-But--
-No ifs or buts!

799
00:58:09,667 --> 00:58:11,375
Be reasonable, the enemy of our enemy--

800
00:58:11,458 --> 00:58:12,333
No way!

801
00:58:18,417 --> 00:58:19,292
Let's go!

802
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:25,458
No biting allowed.

803
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:44,542
How are things going, my bubble gum?

804
00:58:44,792 --> 00:58:46,250
How have you been, buddy?

805
00:58:48,917 --> 00:58:49,833
No, I didn't make it.

806
00:58:49,917 --> 00:58:51,667
I'm calling you from the afterlife.

807
00:58:52,042 --> 00:58:55,000
Bablu!

808
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:57,167
Ba...

809
00:58:59,792 --> 00:59:02,792
Oh, nothing. There are a few animals
that want to be hunted,

810
00:59:02,917 --> 00:59:05,958
so yours truly
decided to grant them their wish.

811
00:59:07,167 --> 00:59:08,125
On a serious note,

812
00:59:08,208 --> 00:59:09,667
bring the hunter with you tomorrow.

813
00:59:09,917 --> 00:59:10,917
I'll catch up.

814
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:12,625
What do you mean "where"?

815
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:14,542
Sia Koh, where else?

816
00:59:14,792 --> 00:59:16,042
To hunt the markhor.

817
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,417
Goodbye.

818
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,750
You think I'll let you leave me?

819
00:59:25,875 --> 00:59:26,875
Darling!

820
00:59:27,125 --> 00:59:27,958
Listen to me.

821
00:59:28,042 --> 00:59:28,917
No!

822
00:59:29,125 --> 00:59:30,375
Not another word.

823
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,375
My love,

824
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:32,667
you have to understand.

825
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:34,042
Life here has become difficult.

826
00:59:34,167 --> 00:59:35,708
Mr. Ali Bunny Khan,

827
00:59:36,042 --> 00:59:38,583
you're probably cheating on me
with a mouse,

828
00:59:38,792 --> 00:59:40,500
that's why you're running away.

829
00:59:41,792 --> 00:59:43,458
Not at all, sweetheart.

830
00:59:43,625 --> 00:59:44,583
It's not like that.

831
00:59:44,667 --> 00:59:46,417
I'll be able to get more food in the city.

832
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:48,250
Really? Fine.

833
00:59:48,542 --> 00:59:49,833
I'm coming with you,

834
00:59:49,917 --> 00:59:52,083
-and so is my mother.
-What?

835
00:59:52,167 --> 00:59:53,500
-Then what's the point?
-What?

836
00:59:54,375 --> 00:59:55,292
Sweetheart.

837
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:58,375
If you get more food,
you'll become even fatter.

838
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:00,583
-What--
-You called me fat?

839
01:00:01,042 --> 01:00:02,167
-No.
-You called me fat?

840
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:03,958
-No! I meant thinner.
-Do I look fat to you?

841
01:00:08,625 --> 01:00:09,542
You know what?

842
01:00:09,792 --> 01:00:11,625
Being able to understand animals

843
01:00:12,417 --> 01:00:13,417
isn't actually a bad power.

844
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:18,167
Oh, no!

845
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:20,792
I'll starve to death.

846
01:00:24,542 --> 01:00:25,708
Here, eat up.

847
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:32,250
It got a little spit on it.

848
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,917
You heartless beast!

849
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,417
Shame on you!

850
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:56,250
That poor bunny.

851
01:00:58,250 --> 01:00:59,250
Chakku, wait!

852
01:01:25,875 --> 01:01:26,833
Do it like this.

853
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:29,208
No, like this.

854
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:32,250
Use your chest.

855
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:34,125
No! From the tummy!

856
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:39,083
What?

857
01:01:43,667 --> 01:01:44,542
There you go.

858
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:49,125
That's it, I'm done.

859
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:50,167
Come on,

860
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:51,083
you're almost there.

861
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:52,583
You just need a little practice.

862
01:01:52,708 --> 01:01:53,708
I'll go relieve myself.

863
01:01:54,542 --> 01:01:55,542
Relieve yourself.

864
01:01:55,917 --> 01:01:56,792
Gross.

865
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:03,583
No one moves.

866
01:02:06,667 --> 01:02:07,583
Run!

867
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:09,083
Hunter! Run!

868
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:19,583
I have to admit,

869
01:02:19,917 --> 01:02:21,917
you've managed to train this goat
to act like a dog.

870
01:02:22,667 --> 01:02:23,625
Don't touch her!

871
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:24,958
You're going to hit me?

872
01:02:28,042 --> 01:02:28,917
Go ahead.

873
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:32,042
Do it already!

874
01:02:39,208 --> 01:02:41,708
Even your father couldn't
do anything against me,

875
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:43,833
so you don't stand a chance.

876
01:02:44,708 --> 01:02:45,958
Don't you worry.

877
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I'll put you out of your misery,

878
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:54,417
just like what I did
to your pathetic father!

879
01:02:57,875 --> 01:02:58,792
Dad.

880
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:10,167
I'm going to make you pay for this!

881
01:03:21,875 --> 01:03:22,833
The hunter!

882
01:03:22,917 --> 01:03:24,958
The hunter is here!

883
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:27,000
Run!

884
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:52,000
You're done for.

885
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:58,625
Chakku.

886
01:04:33,458 --> 01:04:34,292
Allahyar...

887
01:04:36,792 --> 01:04:37,708
Where's that hunter?

888
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:39,208
My...

889
01:04:42,875 --> 01:04:43,875
Dad!

890
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:25,750
<i>Sometimes you will face difficult times
In your life</i>

891
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:27,417
<i>Difficult times</i>

892
01:05:30,292 --> 01:05:32,875
<i>If you keep smiling</i>

893
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:38,042
<i>The hard times will disappear
If you keep smiling</i>

894
01:05:38,708 --> 01:05:40,167
<i>The hard times will disappear</i>

895
01:05:42,417 --> 01:05:45,667
<i>Keep smiling</i>

896
01:05:47,667 --> 01:05:51,667
<i>Every moment is a test</i>

897
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:55,833
<i>You falter and you learn</i>

898
01:05:56,083 --> 01:05:58,833
<i>The world belongs to the brave</i>

899
01:06:00,167 --> 01:06:03,875
<i>No matter what the situation is
No matter how rough the waters are</i>

900
01:06:04,458 --> 01:06:08,708
<i>Do not be discouraged and keep smiling</i>

901
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:21,083
<i>Do not lead a life</i>

902
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:24,958
<i>Conceding to hardships</i>

903
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:29,500
<i>Never be sad</i>

904
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:33,750
<i>Even if someone abandons you midway</i>

905
01:06:34,625 --> 01:06:38,000
<i>Do not be discouraged and keep smiling</i>

906
01:07:08,708 --> 01:07:09,708
He won't come.

907
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:13,833
You don't know what kind of animal he is.

908
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:20,375
They are selfish and ungrateful.

909
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:22,708
Trusting them--

910
01:07:22,792 --> 01:07:28,292
You should never judge anyone
by their race or religion.

911
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:31,125
Such big words from a tiny mouth!

912
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:32,958
I'm impressed.

913
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:35,542
I learned it from my teacher.

914
01:07:35,625 --> 01:07:36,458
"Teacher"?

915
01:07:36,708 --> 01:07:37,708
Your teacher?

916
01:07:37,958 --> 01:07:39,542
Who is that? He sounds like a great man!

917
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:42,083
Yes.

918
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:44,125
He taught me a lot.

919
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:48,083
Fine.

920
01:07:48,417 --> 01:07:49,750
Your teacher might be right.

921
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:52,792
But look at how close we are to Sia Koh!

922
01:07:54,667 --> 01:07:56,667
If Chakku wants to come, he will.

923
01:07:58,375 --> 01:07:59,583
But I'm sure he won't.

924
01:08:13,083 --> 01:08:14,083
Oh, no!

925
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:15,417
This won't work.

926
01:08:35,792 --> 01:08:37,542
<i>Our time has come</i>

927
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:40,083
<i>The sun will shine upon us like this</i>

928
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:47,250
<i>When it drizzles for a moment or two</i>

929
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:50,458
<i>We start looking for shelter</i>

930
01:08:53,708 --> 01:08:57,292
<i>Why should we complain</i>

931
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:02,583
<i>When we are together on this journey?</i>

932
01:09:03,167 --> 01:09:06,792
<i>Our destination is far</i>

933
01:09:08,042 --> 01:09:12,875
<i>Let's go beyond these mountains</i>

934
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,708
<i>My friend</i>

935
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:20,250
<i>My friend</i>

936
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:24,375
<i>My friend</i>

937
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:27,708
<i>My friend</i>

938
01:09:36,333 --> 01:09:38,583
<i>My friend</i>

939
01:09:43,167 --> 01:09:44,833
They left me behind!

940
01:09:45,417 --> 01:09:46,417
I'll have to walk

941
01:09:46,792 --> 01:09:47,958
because I can't fly.

942
01:09:48,375 --> 01:09:49,250
What a drag!

943
01:09:50,667 --> 01:09:51,542
Who is that?

944
01:09:51,792 --> 01:09:52,625
I better hide!

945
01:09:57,917 --> 01:09:58,750
Boss!

946
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:00,208
The markhor,

947
01:10:00,542 --> 01:10:01,750
it went this way!

948
01:10:05,042 --> 01:10:05,875
Boss!

949
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:08,417
Maybe the markhor flew this way

950
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,833
because the ground doesn't have its scent.

951
01:10:22,083 --> 01:10:23,750
Hero is in big trouble.

952
01:10:23,833 --> 01:10:26,458
Let him catch up,
then I'll teach him a lesson.

953
01:10:30,583 --> 01:10:32,917
Don't worry, he will come.

954
01:10:59,792 --> 01:11:00,708
Are you all right?

955
01:11:00,958 --> 01:11:02,875
Yes. I'm okay.

956
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:05,292
Markhor.

957
01:11:05,792 --> 01:11:08,833
Where are you?

958
01:11:08,917 --> 01:11:11,667
Well, look who decided to show up.

959
01:11:11,917 --> 01:11:12,750
Hero, you...

960
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:35,708
<i>The hunter...</i>

961
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:38,458
<i>He'll lead us right to him.</i>

962
01:11:39,167 --> 01:11:40,000
Daplu.

963
01:11:40,167 --> 01:11:41,042
Taplu.

964
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:44,833
Why, Boss?

965
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:02,250
Mehru.

966
01:12:04,417 --> 01:12:05,542
Mehru!

967
01:12:08,292 --> 01:12:09,542
Mehru!

968
01:12:10,958 --> 01:12:13,250
Mehru!

969
01:15:02,917 --> 01:15:03,750
What is four threes?

970
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:05,417
What?

971
01:15:06,083 --> 01:15:07,250
What is four threes?

972
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:22,875
What is three fours?

973
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:25,875
Cricket?

974
01:15:26,375 --> 01:15:27,333
Are you illiterate?

975
01:15:27,708 --> 01:15:30,292
What? No, I'm educated.

976
01:15:30,833 --> 01:15:31,833
I see...

977
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:33,708
Can't you count?

978
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:35,583
Count?

979
01:15:37,583 --> 01:15:39,167
Oh, math!

980
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:43,292
I've studied it, but in English.

981
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:45,792
So you're an Englishman?

982
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:51,167
No, we're taught both. English and Urdu.

983
01:15:51,792 --> 01:15:53,667
So why don't you know math in Urdu?

984
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:55,583
Well...

985
01:15:56,833 --> 01:15:58,958
-Actually--
-What are you doing here?

986
01:15:59,708 --> 01:16:03,625
I came to help a markhor.

987
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:05,125
Her family is in danger.

988
01:16:05,792 --> 01:16:07,417
A group of hunters wants to kill them.

989
01:16:08,167 --> 01:16:09,125
And...

990
01:16:09,958 --> 01:16:12,542
I don't know how to get to Sia Koh.

991
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:20,250
Oh, right.

992
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:22,208
It's right there.

993
01:16:24,292 --> 01:16:25,958
So you intend to stop these hunters?

994
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:28,042
Absolutely!

995
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:29,875
I'm the Protector.

996
01:16:30,875 --> 01:16:33,875
That means I can talk to all animals.

997
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:37,792
And that markhor...

998
01:16:38,875 --> 01:16:40,417
She is my friend.

999
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:42,667
Hunting for sport is wrong!

1000
01:16:45,708 --> 01:16:48,333
I lost all my companions,

1001
01:16:49,042 --> 01:16:51,250
and now I'm alone.

1002
01:16:52,167 --> 01:16:56,167
Now how will I stop the hunter by myself?

1003
01:16:57,750 --> 01:17:00,750
But a protector never backs down!

1004
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:05,625
That hunter doesn't know
who he's dealing with.

1005
01:17:08,042 --> 01:17:10,167
He can't harm Mehru's family

1006
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:12,250
because I won't let them!

1007
01:17:16,417 --> 01:17:19,125
So what are you still doing here?

1008
01:17:31,292 --> 01:17:32,250
Sia Koh.

1009
01:17:45,667 --> 01:17:46,500
Where there's a will...

1010
01:17:53,375 --> 01:17:54,625
There's always a way.

1011
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:36,875
Stop right here.

1012
01:19:13,458 --> 01:19:14,875
Here, take my photos.

1013
01:19:17,917 --> 01:19:18,750
Should we leave?

1014
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:19,708
Where?

1015
01:19:19,792 --> 01:19:21,125
We'll be walking from here.

1016
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:25,042
The terrain isn't suitable for a vehicle.

1017
01:19:25,125 --> 01:19:27,208
So we'll walk a bit and climb a...

1018
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:30,958
Why didn't you tell me before?

1019
01:19:31,958 --> 01:19:35,542
Buddy, my boots are expensive.

1020
01:19:35,625 --> 01:19:37,000
They will be ruined.

1021
01:19:39,292 --> 01:19:40,167
Let's go!

1022
01:19:40,417 --> 01:19:42,125
Incompetent villagers.

1023
01:19:46,083 --> 01:19:47,083
Allahyar!

1024
01:19:47,958 --> 01:19:48,958
Are you all right?

1025
01:19:49,375 --> 01:19:50,250
Yes, I'm fine.

1026
01:19:51,167 --> 01:19:52,167
How much longer?

1027
01:19:53,375 --> 01:19:54,792
Who was that with Mr. Bablu?

1028
01:19:55,042 --> 01:19:55,917
No idea.

1029
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,458
Maybe he's a friend of the hunter.

1030
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:02,292
They are headed towards Sia Koh!

1031
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,500
Don't worry.

1032
01:20:06,917 --> 01:20:07,917
I've got a plan.

1033
01:20:08,667 --> 01:20:10,250
And I know a shortcut!

1034
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:43,458
Are we there yet?

1035
01:20:43,583 --> 01:20:45,583
Almost, sir.

1036
01:20:51,042 --> 01:20:53,208
Let's sit for a moment.

1037
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:00,500
It's all your fault!

1038
01:21:02,042 --> 01:21:02,958
Allahyar?

1039
01:21:03,875 --> 01:21:04,917
Thank god!

1040
01:21:05,125 --> 01:21:07,125
You're all right.

1041
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,292
Get us down, Allahyar.

1042
01:21:09,458 --> 01:21:10,458
Mr. Bablu.

1043
01:21:11,167 --> 01:21:14,125
I thought you were a good person.

1044
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:16,958
I considered you a friend.

1045
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:20,250
Thank you, Mr. Bablu,

1046
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:21,792
for teaching me this valuable lesson.

1047
01:21:28,958 --> 01:21:29,792
Let's go.

1048
01:21:34,125 --> 01:21:35,458
That was beautiful.

1049
01:21:36,125 --> 01:21:39,625
The kid knows how to give a speech.

1050
01:21:40,792 --> 01:21:42,917
And after multiple attempts...

1051
01:21:43,125 --> 01:21:44,917
You're like an annoying fly,

1052
01:21:45,542 --> 01:21:46,625
you keep coming back.

1053
01:21:47,042 --> 01:21:49,625
Did you ever think about
becoming a politician?

1054
01:21:50,167 --> 01:21:51,083
Don't you agree, Bablu?

1055
01:21:51,958 --> 01:21:52,958
Mani.

1056
01:21:53,292 --> 01:21:54,167
Listen.

1057
01:21:57,708 --> 01:21:59,125
Come, get me down.

1058
01:21:59,208 --> 01:22:00,667
Is this some kind of joke?

1059
01:22:02,917 --> 01:22:03,792
Quiet!

1060
01:22:08,708 --> 01:22:09,708
Unfortunately,

1061
01:22:10,208 --> 01:22:12,833
I'm an expert at killing flies.

1062
01:22:14,542 --> 01:22:15,750
Mani, wait.

1063
01:22:15,833 --> 01:22:16,750
Listen to me!

1064
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:17,750
What are you doing?

1065
01:22:17,958 --> 01:22:18,792
Mani!

1066
01:22:19,458 --> 01:22:20,333
Mani, don't!

1067
01:22:22,792 --> 01:22:23,792
Don't do it, Mani!

1068
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:27,833
What are you doing?

1069
01:22:32,125 --> 01:22:33,042
Chakku!

1070
01:22:33,792 --> 01:22:34,792
Mani!

1071
01:22:35,375 --> 01:22:36,417
Are you mad?

1072
01:22:39,708 --> 01:22:40,750
Chakku?

1073
01:22:41,042 --> 01:22:41,958
Chakku?

1074
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:43,000
Chakku, wake up!

1075
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:43,958
Chakku!

1076
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:45,542
Your teacher...

1077
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:48,083
Your teacher was right!

1078
01:22:48,167 --> 01:22:51,042
Never judge someone
by their race or religion.

1079
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:53,000
I always misunderstood him,

1080
01:22:53,417 --> 01:22:55,625
yet he risked his life for us.

1081
01:23:04,292 --> 01:23:05,750
Hey, you cow!

1082
01:23:05,833 --> 01:23:07,042
-What are you saying?
-Chakku!

1083
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:11,375
Will he be all right?

1084
01:23:17,917 --> 01:23:18,875
Wonderful.

1085
01:23:28,167 --> 01:23:29,167
All right, then.

1086
01:23:29,458 --> 01:23:31,667
-Who is first on the list?
-Mani.

1087
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:33,417
Mani, listen!

1088
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:34,875
Boss?

1089
01:23:35,292 --> 01:23:37,292
Can I eat him?

1090
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:39,500
Go ahead.

1091
01:25:07,458 --> 01:25:09,750
Mani, listen to me.

1092
01:25:09,958 --> 01:25:10,958
-What are you doing?
-Stop!

1093
01:25:11,083 --> 01:25:11,958
Mani!

1094
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:40,250
Gross.

1095
01:25:40,333 --> 01:25:41,167
He did it!

1096
01:25:56,042 --> 01:25:56,917
Stop them!

1097
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:59,042
I know they can understand you.

1098
01:25:59,167 --> 01:26:00,417
Look, okay?

1099
01:26:00,583 --> 01:26:01,417
I give up!

1100
01:26:01,542 --> 01:26:02,458
Please!

1101
01:26:02,625 --> 01:26:03,958
I have given up.

1102
01:26:16,375 --> 01:26:17,500
Bablu!

1103
01:26:17,625 --> 01:26:18,500
It's not "Bablu."

1104
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:19,750
It's "Mr. Bablu."

1105
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:28,208
Mr. Bablu.

1106
01:26:29,458 --> 01:26:30,625
Forgive me.

1107
01:26:34,917 --> 01:26:36,750
I'm still your friend,

1108
01:26:36,875 --> 01:26:38,708
and I always will be!

1109
01:26:53,042 --> 01:26:54,167
Don't worry, Chakku!

1110
01:26:54,875 --> 01:26:55,792
I'll visit you!

1111
01:27:09,667 --> 01:27:10,542
Allahyar?

1112
01:27:25,458 --> 01:27:26,417
Dad!

1113
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:28,375
Dad!

1114
01:27:39,375 --> 01:27:40,542
I looked everywhere for you.

1115
01:27:43,167 --> 01:27:44,583
Thank god, you're all right.

1116
01:27:47,875 --> 01:27:48,792
Shall we go home?

1117
01:28:05,625 --> 01:28:06,500
Mehru!

1118
01:28:07,167 --> 01:28:08,167
Mehru!

1119
01:28:18,208 --> 01:28:19,125
Mehru!

1120
01:28:33,333 --> 01:28:35,542
My parents are waiting for me.

1121
01:28:37,042 --> 01:28:37,917
Yes.

1122
01:28:38,417 --> 01:28:39,250
My dad is waiting, too.

1123
01:29:01,167 --> 01:29:03,500
Take care of yourself, monkey.

1124
01:29:27,417 --> 01:29:28,833
Sweetheart, listen.

1125
01:29:29,208 --> 01:29:30,375
Listen to me!

1126
01:29:30,917 --> 01:29:31,792
Hero!

1127
01:29:32,083 --> 01:29:34,333
I don't have time for you, monkey.
Catch you later!

1128
01:29:34,625 --> 01:29:35,625
My moon!

1129
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:39,167
Good to go?

1130
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:41,750
Oh, Dad?

1131
01:29:42,208 --> 01:29:43,167
<i>Did you know?</i>

1132
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,083
<i>I can talk to animals!</i>

1133
01:29:46,583 --> 01:29:47,458
<i>Oh, really?</i>

1134
01:29:47,583 --> 01:29:48,417
<i>Wow!</i>

1135
01:29:50,542 --> 01:29:51,417
<i>Dad,</i>

1136
01:29:51,542 --> 01:29:52,542
<i>I'm serious.</i>

1137
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:53,792
<i>It's true.</i>

1138
01:29:54,208 --> 01:29:55,417
<i>I'm not a little boy anymore!</i>

1139
01:29:55,792 --> 01:29:57,292
<i>So what are you? A little girl?</i>

1140
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,333
<i>Dad.</i>

1141
01:30:11,875 --> 01:30:14,125
<i>Why are you scared of the night?</i>

1142
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:19,000
<i>When the night ends, the day begins</i>

1143
01:30:20,875 --> 01:30:23,292
<i>Why do you cry because of a dream?</i>

1144
01:30:24,792 --> 01:30:27,583
<i>We are made of these dreams</i>

1145
01:30:38,167 --> 01:30:40,792
<i>Why do you look for your loved ones?</i>

1146
01:30:42,583 --> 01:30:44,833
<i>They live in our hearts</i>

1147
01:30:46,792 --> 01:30:49,458
<i>Why are you scared of failing?</i>

1148
01:30:51,083 --> 01:30:53,667
<i>Failure paves the way to success</i>

1149
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:56,375
<i>Go ahead</i>

1150
01:30:56,875 --> 01:30:58,750
<i>And lose</i>

1151
01:30:59,375 --> 01:31:00,625
<i>Your ego</i>

1152
01:31:01,167 --> 01:31:04,500
<i>Pour your heart out, my friend</i>

1153
01:31:04,667 --> 01:31:08,583
<i>Say Allah, Allah, Allah
Say Allahyar</i>

1154
01:31:09,083 --> 01:31:13,125
<i>Say Allah, Allah, Allah

1155
01:31:14,667 --> 01:31:15,583
Rani!

1156
01:31:16,125 --> 01:31:17,542
Oh, no!

1157
01:31:17,792 --> 01:31:19,417
You've come back to annoy me?

1158
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:22,125
You're the stinkiest monkey!

1159
01:31:22,208 --> 01:31:24,125
What? Rani!

1160
01:31:25,333 --> 01:31:28,792
<i>Say Allah, Allah, Allah

1161

<i>Say Allah, Allah, Allah

1164
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,750
<i>Why are you angry about these paths?</i>

1165
01:31:55,458 --> 01:31:58,833
<i>They take you to your destination</i>

1166
01:31:59,875 --> 01:32:02,792
<i>Why are you so full of yourself?</i>

1167
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:06,583
<i>This is indeed your mistake</i>

1168
01:32:08,833 --> 01:32:11,208
<i>Go ahead</i>

1169
01:32:11,792 --> 01:32:13,333
<i>And lose your ego</i>

1170
01:32:14,167 --> 01:32:16,750
<i>Pour your heart out, my friend</i>

01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,208
<i>We will rule the world
With a smile on our faces</i>
