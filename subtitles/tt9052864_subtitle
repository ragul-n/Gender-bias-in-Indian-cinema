1
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:14,594
Smoking and drinking
is injurious to health...

2
00:00:14,674 --> 00:00:16,581
and a cause for financial problems.

3
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:18,946
Smoking and drinking
is injurious to health...

4
00:00:19,026 --> 00:00:20,784
and a cause for financial problems.

5
00:00:30,293 --> 00:00:31,428
As a sportsman...

6
00:00:31,508 --> 00:00:35,320
I desire to see every
Indian strong and healthy.

7
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:38,793
Tobacco destroys health and vitality.

8
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:43,413
Tobacco is harmful and
life-threatening in every form.

9
00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:47,359
Shun tobacco if you
want to lead a healthy life.

10
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:49,711
That's what I do,
and I want you to do the same.

11
00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:52,359
Let's fight against tobacco.

12
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,140
While standing in the slip...

13
00:01:06,164 --> 00:01:08,631
my goal is not
to miss a single catch.

14
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:12,901
Because that could
mean defeat for our team.

15
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:19,671
Smoking and chewing of
tobacco can ruin your life...

16
00:01:19,896 --> 00:01:22,869
so be careful not
to lose your good health.

17
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:28,247
Be good. Stay away from tobacco.

18
00:01:42,177 --> 00:01:45,082
It is sad to get run
out when you are batting well.

19
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:47,167
It may be caused by
your own weaknesses...

20
00:01:47,396 --> 00:01:49,504
or your partner's mistake.

21
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:53,599
Tobacco is harmful to you.

22
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:57,085
When you smoke,
the people around you inhale it too.

23
00:01:58,126 --> 00:02:00,392
Be safe. Stay away from tobacco.

24
00:02:00,608 --> 00:02:01,675
Don't get run out.

25
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:13,728
Khaine, Ghutka,
Tobacco, Pan, Pan Masala...

26
00:02:13,808 --> 00:02:15,741
are a big menace to our country.

27
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:18,714
They are the leading
cause for mouth cancer.

28
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:20,930
This patient has tongue cancer.

29
00:02:21,363 --> 00:02:23,890
We removed his larynx.

30
00:02:25,215 --> 00:02:26,715
We have left it in God's hands.

31
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:29,688
We removed Rekha's tongue and lower jaw.

32
00:02:31,174 --> 00:02:33,107
We had to sell both her gold bangles.

33
00:02:34,283 --> 00:02:37,337
Tobacco destroys families.

34
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:01,761
How did they kill so
many people at the same time?

35
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:03,112
That's what I can't figure out.

36
00:05:03,192 --> 00:05:06,745
Looks like they slit
throats for gold chains...

37
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:08,650
and chop off hands for gold rings.

38
00:05:08,961 --> 00:05:11,664
Do you mean they killed
all these people for gold?

39
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:12,906
Are they humans or beasts?

40
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:15,488
How can a human kill
other humans so brutally?

41
00:05:17,258 --> 00:05:18,907
Did you find any clues?

42
00:05:18,987 --> 00:05:19,839
No, sir.

43
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,407
No surprise there.
Nobody leaves clues these days.

44
00:05:23,596 --> 00:05:25,663
Sir, the press is here.

45
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:28,042
Of course. I'll handle them.

46
00:05:28,122 --> 00:05:32,336
Send all the bodies for post mortem.

47
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,039
Maybe we'll find some clues.

48
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:35,892
Load all the bodies into the ambulance.

49
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,757
Even amidst all these
bodies and all this wailing...

50
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:39,581
you are calm and collected.
Don't you care?

51
00:05:39,755 --> 00:05:43,755
By caring if you mean
to look into the camera...

52
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:47,167
and announce dramatically
that I won't sleep until...

53
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:51,707
I find the ones responsible
for this massacre...

54
00:05:51,787 --> 00:05:53,477
sorry, I'm not an actor.

55
00:05:53,694 --> 00:05:55,450
So, who do you think these thieves are?

56
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,091
Can you say how long
will you take to catch them?

57
00:05:57,115 --> 00:05:59,454
Do you think there's political
involvement in this case?

58
00:05:59,534 --> 00:06:02,062
Excuse me, slow down a bit.

59
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,091
You can shoot questions
at me in anger...

60
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:05,753
but I can't answer them
until I think them through.

61
00:06:05,777 --> 00:06:08,805
I need brains to do my work,
so stop picking my brains.

62
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,510
We need some time, so, be patient.

63
00:06:14,686 --> 00:06:15,769
Morning, sir!
- Not at all, sir.

64
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,483
I'm personally following it.

65
00:06:18,605 --> 00:06:21,267
I've been checking up
on it for the past two days.

66
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:23,591
Yes, sir.

67
00:06:24,047 --> 00:06:25,344
I'll keep you informed.

68
00:06:26,398 --> 00:06:28,331
No, sir. I'll keep you informed.

69
00:06:29,642 --> 00:06:31,049
How did they manage to
kill so many people at once?

70
00:06:31,073 --> 00:06:31,682
Actually sir...

71
00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:33,669
The high officials
are on my back about it.

72
00:06:33,952 --> 00:06:36,263
I wish I had something to tell you, sir.

73
00:06:36,595 --> 00:06:37,879
We didn't find a single clue.

74
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,785
We are waiting for
the post mortem reports...

75
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:41,905
hoping that we'll find
some clues at least there.

76
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,704
Sir, the post mortem reports.

77
00:06:51,874 --> 00:06:55,144
According to this report
all 15 people died at the same time.

78
00:06:55,658 --> 00:06:58,806
But the problem is,
those 15 people stay in different homes.

79
00:06:59,063 --> 00:07:00,580
Since all of them
died at the same time...

80
00:07:00,604 --> 00:07:05,662
I'm guessing there
are at least 15 thieves.

81
00:07:05,742 --> 00:07:08,352
We've to stop it right now.
I want immediate results.

82
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,189
It is difficult to catch a single man...

83
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:13,311
but catching a big group is easy.

84
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:37,390
Join your hands in prayer.

85
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:48,444
Is it really necessary
to recite all these mantras?

86
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:52,279
These mantras are important
to set the right mood.

87
00:09:59,518 --> 00:10:01,505
You spoke to me yesterday.

88
00:10:01,762 --> 00:10:03,802
You promised you will
forget my daughter completely.

89
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:06,289
I forgot 80%.

90
00:10:06,369 --> 00:10:08,137
But I'm here to see
the face of a girl...

91
00:10:08,217 --> 00:10:12,204
who fell in love with
me but is marrying another man.

92
00:10:13,677 --> 00:10:15,069
Please don't make a scene here.

93
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:17,785
What should I do to help
you forget the remaining 20%?

94
00:10:18,168 --> 00:10:21,441
Bring me a case of beers.
I'll forget her while drinking.

95
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,756
I can't let you drink here.

96
00:10:25,812 --> 00:10:27,965
If you want me to forget her,
I've to drink.

97
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:29,816
If you don't want that,
I will marry her.

98
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,724
No, don't say that.

99
00:10:31,804 --> 00:10:33,709
I'll make arrangements
for you to forget her.

100
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:35,567
Keep drinking.

101
00:10:38,082 --> 00:10:41,229
Here you go. You can finish everything.

102
00:10:51,258 --> 00:10:54,447
Kanchana! Darn!

103
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:08,513
Give me the turmeric rice grains.

104
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:13,517
Live a happy life!

105
00:11:15,987 --> 00:11:19,493
You girls are always happy.
We are the ones who die.

106
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:22,874
Take this.

107
00:11:24,373 --> 00:11:25,809
Do you drink?
- No!

108
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:27,878
Then why did you take it? Give it to me.

109
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:32,481
Music!

110
00:11:34,635 --> 00:11:37,507
Father! Father!
- Wait, I'm coming.

111
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,350
Why are you blocking the way?
Move aside.

112
00:11:45,077 --> 00:11:46,703
Did you get drunk again?

113
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:49,680
Kanchana got married,
that's I got drunk.

114
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,362
I'm glad your mother
died as soon as you were born.

115
00:11:52,805 --> 00:11:54,832
I wonder when I'll
die and get rid of you.

116
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:56,226
Don't you have any shame?

117
00:11:56,306 --> 00:11:58,696
You get drunk whining
about Kanchana's wedding...

118
00:11:58,776 --> 00:12:00,618
Kamakshi's wedding and so on.

119
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,971
Do you ever remember that
your father is alone at home?

120
00:12:05,647 --> 00:12:07,231
Disgusting!

121
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:08,878
Anyway, come let's have a drink.

122
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,179
What? After abusing me till now...

123
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:12,629
you suddenly remembered
that I'm your son?

124
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:15,276
I'm your father after all,
it is my duty to scold you.

125
00:12:16,099 --> 00:12:17,831
But you know me.

126
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:27,793
You were not born dark like me, my boy.

127
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,756
You are fair like your mother...

128
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:31,596
you are the handsome
hunk of this village.

129
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:33,072
Why should you cry for some girl?

130
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,795
That's easy for you to say
because you've lived your life.

131
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:38,348
I haven't even started my life yet,
you won't understand my pain.

132
00:12:38,372 --> 00:12:43,976
That's why I sent your photo
to all the neighboring villages.

133
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:46,130
It seems somebody liked you a lot.

134
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,361
The priest said that they
will come to see you tomorrow.

135
00:12:48,385 --> 00:12:52,338
So, go to sleep now
and get up early tomorrow.

136
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:06,625
Take it off, I can't see it.
I feel like puking.

137
00:13:06,705 --> 00:13:08,377
Do I look so disgusting?

138
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:11,566
You think you look handsome
in that flower print shirt?

139
00:13:11,646 --> 00:13:13,508
It's a faded shirt. Don't be so jealous.

140
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:16,401
Father, we should
go to the girl's house.

141
00:13:16,481 --> 00:13:18,090
Why are they coming here?

142
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:21,891
The girl isn't coming today.
Her father is coming...

143
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:23,953
to see our house and our status.
That's how it works.

144
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:27,920
They why did you wake
me up early and got me ready?

145
00:13:28,237 --> 00:13:29,757
And I drank less last night.

146
00:13:30,095 --> 00:13:33,009
Last night was the first
time you drank less in 3 years.

147
00:13:33,558 --> 00:13:35,754
Yeah.
- Here comes the priest.

148
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:39,132
Hello! Where is the father?

149
00:13:39,212 --> 00:13:41,286
I don't know,
I haven't been able to reach him.

150
00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:44,721
Maybe he found out about
your son and decided not to come.

151
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:46,108
What is there to find out about me?

152
00:13:46,132 --> 00:13:48,586
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

153
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,458
You get drunk and punch
people in their faces.

154
00:13:50,482 --> 00:13:52,766
Calm down.
Don't raise your fist everywhere.

155
00:13:52,846 --> 00:13:55,955
Okay, forget them.
Any other marriage proposals nearby?

156
00:13:56,035 --> 00:14:00,051
Nearby? There's a family
in Chundurpalli. Will you go?

157
00:14:05,602 --> 00:14:08,706
Priest, we don't want snacks.
Ask them to bring the girl.

158
00:14:08,786 --> 00:14:10,501
Dear, please bring the girl.

159
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,742
How is she?

160
00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:29,366
Wow.

161
00:14:33,758 --> 00:14:37,559
Suvarna, what are you doing here?

162
00:14:39,185 --> 00:14:40,895
Our daughter.

163
00:14:44,337 --> 00:14:46,089
My son.

164
00:14:50,494 --> 00:14:53,641
Is this what a father does?

165
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:59,046
Don't look at me like that.
I feel guilty.

166
00:14:59,553 --> 00:15:04,219
After your mother's death,
in one of the weak moments...

167
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:08,439
Stop it!
When I have a father like you...

168
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:12,134
how can I expect my
life to be good? Let's go.

169
00:15:12,683 --> 00:15:14,119
Disgusting!

170
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,137
I should...
0 Make your heart strong, son.

171
00:15:21,341 --> 00:15:23,325
Stop! Where are you coming?
- Who is it?

172
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,451
We stayed here thinking
that he is no more.

173
00:15:26,531 --> 00:15:29,346
Now that we know he's alive,
how can we stay here?

174
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:30,676
That's right.

175
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,930
Okay, come.

176
00:15:32,112 --> 00:15:33,485
Come on, he said yes.

177
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:35,385
Walk carefully, Suvarna.

178
00:15:39,165 --> 00:15:40,664
Brother!

179
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:44,993
Not me.

180
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,421
Brother, listen!

181
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:54,878
Listen, dear. Yesterday
I saw you in a different light.

182
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:58,319
Don't call me brother so soon.
It will take some time.

183
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,437
I will definitely accept
you as my little sister. What is it?

184
00:16:02,859 --> 00:16:05,097
When I was in that village,
my college was nearby.

185
00:16:05,646 --> 00:16:07,610
But from here I've to take a bus.

186
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,552
Can you please drop me at the bus stand?

187
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:14,007
Do I have a choice? Let's go.

188
00:16:15,548 --> 00:16:16,942
What are you studying?

189
00:16:17,554 --> 00:16:18,758
Graduation.

190
00:16:18,838 --> 00:16:20,718
Wow! What do you plan
to do with your education?

191
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,467
I wanted to discontinue
when they talked of marriage.

192
00:16:22,491 --> 00:16:24,241
What can I do?
A father who is at home all day.

193
00:16:24,265 --> 00:16:26,289
A brother who has no work.
And a mother who is lost.

194
00:16:26,313 --> 00:16:27,387
So I decided to continue my studies.

195
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:28,830
Shut up, get down.

196
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:32,808
This is why I hate educated people.

197
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:34,961
You can study all you want,
but don't irritate me.

198
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:38,044
Your teeth will fall off if
I give you a tight slap. Get lost.

199
00:16:38,124 --> 00:16:39,607
You get lost.

200
00:16:39,881 --> 00:16:41,317
I'm crying for a wife and kids...

201
00:16:41,397 --> 00:16:43,037
and she's gloating
about her education.

202
00:16:43,065 --> 00:16:45,772
Where will I find a bride now?

203
00:17:00,837 --> 00:17:03,625
"Where were you born,
my beautiful flower?"

204
00:17:03,705 --> 00:17:07,151
"You cut my heart into two."

205
00:17:12,383 --> 00:17:15,424
"Where were you born,
my long haired beauty?"

206
00:17:15,504 --> 00:17:18,612
"You just crushed me under your feet."

207
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:29,466
"Looks like God sculpted
you from marble stone."

208
00:17:29,546 --> 00:17:35,423
"I've never seen intoxicating
beauty like yours."

209
00:17:35,503 --> 00:17:40,301
"I will build a temple
for your tiny waist."

210
00:18:11,441 --> 00:18:17,142
"I've never been to school.
I can't read or write."

211
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:22,631
"But I feel like writing
poems about you."

212
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:28,585
"I just get drunk and create a ruckus."

213
00:18:28,665 --> 00:18:34,101
"But you completely changed me."

214
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:39,776
"Don't sway your hips like that."

215
00:18:39,856 --> 00:18:47,856
"Don't slip away from my hands."

216
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:51,601
"Where were you born,
my beautiful flower?"

217
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:55,180
"You cut my heart into two."

218
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,714
Koti, let's have a drink.

219
00:19:18,363 --> 00:19:26,363
"Your intoxicating beauty
has me hooked to you."

220
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:36,100
"When I see you with
flowers in your hair..."

221
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:41,168
"my throat goes dry."

222
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:47,185
"You are like candy
and I'm dying to taste you."

223
00:19:47,265 --> 00:19:55,235
"Your beauty has robbed me of my sleep."

224
00:19:56,344 --> 00:19:59,274
"Where were you born,
my beautiful flower?"

225
00:19:59,354 --> 00:20:02,256
"You cut my heart into two."

226
00:20:18,482 --> 00:20:20,752
Did he start already?

227
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:24,738
Can I ask where you were?

228
00:20:25,187 --> 00:20:28,169
You are not a responsible
father to ask me that...

229
00:20:28,249 --> 00:20:30,307
and I'm not a responsible
son to answer that.

230
00:20:30,387 --> 00:20:33,052
Why waste time?
Pour me a drink, I'll be back.

231
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:34,292
You and your silly questions.

232
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:36,758
Oh, so secretive.

233
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:45,099
Here, pour me a drink.

234
00:20:46,022 --> 00:20:47,553
Where is your daughter?

235
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,770
She's sitting in
the garden and studying.

236
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,357
She's studying too much.

237
00:20:52,674 --> 00:20:54,548
Why are you drinking
without anything to eat?

238
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:56,475
Tell your wife to make me an omelet.

239
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,847
Suvarna.
- Yes.

240
00:20:57,927 --> 00:20:59,299
Suvarna.
- Just a minute.

241
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:00,259
She's coming.

242
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:01,631
Make an omelet for him.

243
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:03,558
We don't have eggs at home.

244
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,828
What? I bought a dozen eggs yesterday.

245
00:21:06,857 --> 00:21:09,338
He has been drinking since afternoon.

246
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,614
Eggs. We were talking about old times...

247
00:21:13,694 --> 00:21:18,075
and I enjoyed it while
eating and drinking. So, no eggs.

248
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,902
Do you remember, Suvarna?
Kodlapalli railway station.

249
00:21:21,982 --> 00:21:24,225
The time we enjoyed there.

250
00:21:25,004 --> 00:21:27,908
Good train. In the middle of the night.

251
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,383
Stop it!

252
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,468
I can't see this anymore.

253
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,346
I don't want to stay
and hear those gross details.

254
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,583
I'm going to buy some eggs.

255
00:21:42,663 --> 00:21:47,624
Don't take my drink away...
- You and your stupid love story.

256
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:01,602
Health Center.
I'm sure they have eggs here.

257
00:22:01,682 --> 00:22:03,714
Let me ask.

258
00:22:05,219 --> 00:22:07,911
Madam! Madam!

259
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,454
Maybe they woke up from sleep.

260
00:22:15,011 --> 00:22:17,334
Can you please give me some eggs?

261
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,514
We are not here to provide
for drunkards like you.

262
00:22:20,594 --> 00:22:25,160
We provide for poor children,
orphans and school-going kids.

263
00:22:25,793 --> 00:22:29,014
Good. Small villages like
this benefit from your help.

264
00:22:29,094 --> 00:22:31,653
Okay, go inside. Go inside.

265
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:33,553
Stupid drunkard!

266
00:22:35,058 --> 00:22:39,677
Thank you, madam.
I'll never ask your help again.

267
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,590
Why is she sitting outside?

268
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:58,306
Why doesn't she look at me?

269
00:22:59,573 --> 00:23:01,394
Look at me.

270
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,779
Did she see me?
Or is she pretending that she didn't?

271
00:23:05,803 --> 00:23:09,192
Why are you pacing here? I've seen you.

272
00:23:09,614 --> 00:23:12,359
Oh, you've seen me?
Why are you sitting outside?

273
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:13,705
There's no electricity.

274
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:15,847
What? Everybody else in
the village has electricity.

275
00:23:15,871 --> 00:23:17,374
Why don't you have it?

276
00:23:17,454 --> 00:23:19,248
I don't know.
0 Do you want me to check?

277
00:23:19,328 --> 00:23:21,650
Go ahead.
- Where's the fuse?

278
00:23:22,178 --> 00:23:23,709
There!

279
00:23:29,252 --> 00:23:31,390
The fuse was blown, that's it.
- Okay.

280
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,079
Can I get some water?

281
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:35,374
Why don't you ask if you can come in?

282
00:23:35,454 --> 00:23:36,825
Why beat around the bush?

283
00:23:36,905 --> 00:23:40,494
I mean, I met you just now.
How can I ask that?

284
00:23:40,574 --> 00:23:41,840
It's okay, come in.

285
00:23:46,195 --> 00:23:48,624
What is your name?
- Parvati.

286
00:23:48,814 --> 00:23:50,652
Won't you ask my name?
- Tell me.

287
00:23:51,323 --> 00:23:52,328
Koteshwar Rao.

288
00:23:52,626 --> 00:23:53,988
Bala Koteshwar Rao.

289
00:23:54,658 --> 00:23:57,058
Is there nobody else in your family?

290
00:23:57,664 --> 00:23:59,304
I lost my mother when
I was a little girl.

291
00:23:59,858 --> 00:24:02,561
My grandma is not well,
that's why my father went to town.

292
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:05,462
Why didn't I see you around before?

293
00:24:05,689 --> 00:24:08,835
The ones without work
may not see the village...

294
00:24:09,646 --> 00:24:11,646
but the village
sees those without work.

295
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,494
So, you saw me before?

296
00:24:14,728 --> 00:24:17,128
Yes, I saw you.
Where are you going so late at night?

297
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:20,642
Every night I like to drink
and eat an omelet with it.

298
00:24:20,977 --> 00:24:23,085
Otherwise I can't sleep.
There are no eggs at home.

299
00:24:23,165 --> 00:24:24,263
So, I came out to buy some.

300
00:24:24,712 --> 00:24:26,087
Where will you find eggs at this time?

301
00:24:26,111 --> 00:24:27,711
Wait here, I can make an omelet for you.

302
00:24:28,106 --> 00:24:31,815
You'll make an omelet,
but where will I get a drink?

303
00:24:31,987 --> 00:24:33,827
My father's alcohol
is in that corner, take it.

304
00:24:33,858 --> 00:24:34,960
Don't you mind?

305
00:24:35,213 --> 00:24:36,691
I wouldn't have told
you if I had a problem.

306
00:24:36,715 --> 00:24:38,435
I don't say no when
a man offers me a drink.

307
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:40,562
Why would I say no when
a woman offers me a drink?

308
00:24:40,586 --> 00:24:41,850
Where is it?

309
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,388
Did I fall asleep here last night?

310
00:25:12,468 --> 00:25:13,253
Yes.

311
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:16,053
Oh. Maybe I got too
drunk and fell asleep.

312
00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:17,037
Please don't mind.

313
00:25:17,117 --> 00:25:19,157
If I had a problem,
I would've given you a scolding.

314
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:21,278
Why would I smile at
you as soon as you wake up?

315
00:25:21,592 --> 00:25:24,933
There's only one cot here.
Where did you sleep?

316
00:25:25,225 --> 00:25:27,798
Where do you think I slept? Beside you.

317
00:25:28,164 --> 00:25:30,748
Really? Darn,
if I had known, I would've been sober.

318
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:33,688
Okay, I'm leaving.
It's time to go to college.

319
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:37,645
When you go, leave the keys there.
Don't forget.

320
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,190
Remember to wash
your face before you go.

321
00:25:41,214 --> 00:25:42,974
It looks swollen because
of all the drinking.

322
00:25:45,123 --> 00:25:46,123
Okay.

323
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,732
Why did I drink so much?
I wonder what she thinks of me.

324
00:25:52,478 --> 00:25:53,830
What is he doing here?

325
00:25:54,013 --> 00:25:55,093
I should've been careful...

326
00:25:56,003 --> 00:25:57,786
Manamma! How are you?

327
00:25:58,132 --> 00:25:59,592
What were you doing here?

328
00:25:59,908 --> 00:26:02,268
I got so drunk last night
that I didn't realize where I was.

329
00:26:02,589 --> 00:26:04,522
I fell asleep here thinking
that this was my house.

330
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:06,816
I have a bad headache.
Let's have some tea.

331
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:09,033
Okay, let's go.
What else do we have to do?

332
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,778
You are like a buffalo.
How do I pedal your weight?

333
00:26:12,858 --> 00:26:15,005
Where were you last week?

334
00:26:15,297 --> 00:26:17,989
What can I say?
I couldn't bear my family's torture...

335
00:26:18,069 --> 00:26:20,648
so I went on a pilgrimage.

336
00:26:20,728 --> 00:26:22,658
Yeah right,
you've become very responsible.

337
00:26:22,738 --> 00:26:23,738
True.

338
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:25,182
Hey!

339
00:26:25,522 --> 00:26:26,258
Who is he?

340
00:26:26,338 --> 00:26:29,609
Rascal! Who is driving
so fast in the village?

341
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:31,623
Chandu!

342
00:26:31,703 --> 00:26:33,245
Who are you? Oh, you.

343
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,799
It's you. What are you doing in a car?

344
00:26:34,823 --> 00:26:35,823
Is it a used car?

345
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:37,431
I'm planning to go
Hyderabad next week and...

346
00:26:37,455 --> 00:26:40,077
become an Ola cab driver.

347
00:26:40,157 --> 00:26:41,957
You really think you
can be successful in Ola?

348
00:26:42,006 --> 00:26:43,526
Anyway, get down. Let's go for a ride.

349
00:26:43,606 --> 00:26:44,866
Manamma, get in!

350
00:26:44,946 --> 00:26:47,277
Careful, man. I mortgaged
everything I had to buy this.

351
00:26:51,347 --> 00:26:54,147
"I said no but I finally came."

352
00:26:54,227 --> 00:26:57,249
"I brought jasmines for you,
my darling."

353
00:26:57,329 --> 00:27:00,136
"Come to play with me
after the sun goes down."

354
00:27:00,216 --> 00:27:03,642
"The flower adorned bed
will not make any noise."

355
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:06,604
"Let's get married with great pomp."

356
00:27:06,684 --> 00:27:09,804
"Let's get locked in
our room till the morning."

357
00:27:13,776 --> 00:27:15,106
Why did the police stop us?

358
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:17,009
What did you last night?

359
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:18,685
Whose car is it?

360
00:27:18,765 --> 00:27:19,431
It's mine, sir.

361
00:27:19,658 --> 00:27:20,658
You can go.

362
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:27,673
Did you get drunk early in the morning?

363
00:27:27,753 --> 00:27:29,240
Why would we do sir?

364
00:27:29,457 --> 00:27:30,957
We are still hung-over from last night.

365
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:34,019
Come here. Come on.

366
00:27:34,283 --> 00:27:35,861
Oh God! He'll break my jaw.

367
00:27:36,402 --> 00:27:38,185
What do you both do?

368
00:27:38,661 --> 00:27:40,272
We are too young to work, sir.

369
00:27:40,758 --> 00:27:44,804
You look older than the earth itself.

370
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,896
It's disgusting if you
think you are still young.

371
00:27:47,976 --> 00:27:49,626
Ramakrishna, put them in the jeep.

372
00:27:50,404 --> 00:27:51,404
Why, sir?

373
00:27:52,565 --> 00:27:55,235
Don't be scared. I won't harm you.

374
00:27:55,315 --> 00:27:57,041
Take me around your village.

375
00:28:42,874 --> 00:28:47,177
A gang of burglars is going
around villages looting them.

376
00:28:47,257 --> 00:28:49,112
So, be careful.

377
00:28:49,192 --> 00:28:50,820
If you see anyone new in the village...

378
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,139
who looks a little suspicious,
call me on this number.

379
00:28:54,591 --> 00:28:55,877
Okay?
- Okay, sir.

380
00:28:55,957 --> 00:28:57,218
Ramakrishna, start the car.

381
00:29:00,061 --> 00:29:01,910
Who will come to our village? Take it.

382
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,520
What will I do with it?

383
00:29:06,768 --> 00:29:07,881
What language is this?

384
00:29:08,822 --> 00:29:10,335
Why does she look upset?

385
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:17,401
Parvati!

386
00:29:19,461 --> 00:29:20,461
Hey Parvati!

387
00:29:22,877 --> 00:29:23,877
Hey Parvati!

388
00:29:25,771 --> 00:29:26,771
Hey Parvati!

389
00:29:27,717 --> 00:29:33,324
Oh, she's bathing. I'll wait here.

390
00:29:40,037 --> 00:29:41,037
What are you doing here?

391
00:29:41,216 --> 00:29:42,783
Why did you look upset this evening?

392
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,519
I've been on edge ever since.
So, I came here to confront you.

393
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:48,913
Is this the right place to ask that?

394
00:29:48,937 --> 00:29:52,435
I can come anywhere
to ask whatever I want.

395
00:29:53,452 --> 00:29:56,057
Okay, I'll go inside and get dressed.

396
00:29:56,137 --> 00:29:57,518
Come to the front door
after waiting a few minutes.

397
00:29:57,542 --> 00:30:00,178
Sure. I'll go have
a drink in the meantime.

398
00:30:00,258 --> 00:30:03,281
You have to tell me why you got upset.
I have to know.

399
00:30:03,361 --> 00:30:04,361
Okay.

400
00:30:09,658 --> 00:30:11,853
They won't find girls
like you even in the city.

401
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:15,788
If a girl can't understand
the man she likes...

402
00:30:15,972 --> 00:30:17,332
it doesn't matter where she is.

403
00:30:17,377 --> 00:30:19,312
I don't understand such big words.

404
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,098
I'll have a drink and listen to you.

405
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:29,606
What were you telling me? Come here.

406
00:30:30,887 --> 00:30:32,346
Come on, come on, come here.

407
00:30:32,962 --> 00:30:35,016
Don't stand so far. Come closer.

408
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,914
What were you saying?

409
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,233
Okay, listen carefully. I like you.

410
00:30:42,525 --> 00:30:46,654
I got upset when I saw you
getting down from the police jeep.

411
00:30:47,465 --> 00:30:48,865
That's why I looked at you angrily.

412
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:52,211
Look, I'm not an educated man.

413
00:30:52,421 --> 00:30:54,021
So tell me clearly how much you like me.

414
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:56,326
I like you so much that
I will give you whatever you ask.

415
00:30:56,356 --> 00:30:58,519
Whatever I ask?
Will you kiss me if I ask you to?

416
00:30:58,724 --> 00:30:59,724
Hmm.

417
00:31:01,405 --> 00:31:03,005
You shouldn't get
angry after I kiss you.

418
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:06,452
I hope you are not angry.

419
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:07,630
No.

420
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:09,274
Then I'll kiss you one more time.

421
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:12,993
'I'll go for the lips this time.'

422
00:31:42,347 --> 00:31:44,649
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

423
00:31:44,729 --> 00:31:45,816
Hmm.

424
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:50,411
You might be okay, but I'm not okay.

425
00:31:51,308 --> 00:31:53,178
I can't stay away from you. Come here.

426
00:33:42,457 --> 00:33:46,598
Oh god! What did I drink last night?
I have a splitting headache.

427
00:34:08,334 --> 00:34:09,891
Do we have buttermilk at home?

428
00:34:10,237 --> 00:34:11,277
Yes, I'll get you a glass.

429
00:34:11,344 --> 00:34:12,344
No, sit down.

430
00:34:31,882 --> 00:34:33,861
I should drink only
one brand from now on.

431
00:34:35,234 --> 00:34:38,628
My head groans in pain
when I mix different brands.

432
00:34:47,687 --> 00:34:49,514
Son!

433
00:34:50,595 --> 00:34:51,308
What?

434
00:34:51,388 --> 00:34:53,137
You left yesterday
morning and came home now.

435
00:34:53,161 --> 00:34:54,613
I thought you may be hungry.

436
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:59,110
Are you doing this
to take my mother's place?

437
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:01,034
Stay in your limits.

438
00:35:01,242 --> 00:35:03,069
I'm letting you stay
here for my father..

439
00:35:03,149 --> 00:35:05,080
..otherwise I would've
thrown you out. Go away.

440
00:35:05,555 --> 00:35:08,366
Stupid woman.
Not letting me sleep in peace.

441
00:35:17,196 --> 00:35:19,044
What's wrong? Why are you sitting here?

442
00:35:32,681 --> 00:35:34,249
Get up, you rascal!

443
00:35:34,443 --> 00:35:35,103
What is it, father?

444
00:35:35,276 --> 00:35:36,519
Why did you shout at her?

445
00:35:36,746 --> 00:35:38,476
Are you giving her food or shelter?

446
00:35:39,114 --> 00:35:41,038
I don't know how happy
it makes her feel..

447
00:35:41,118 --> 00:35:43,661
..when her own daughter
calls her mother..

448
00:35:43,996 --> 00:35:47,380
..but she's been yearning
to hear you call her mother.

449
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,932
You lost your own mother
as soon as you were born.

450
00:35:50,152 --> 00:35:52,444
Now you are losing another
mother with your stupidity.

451
00:35:52,779 --> 00:35:55,017
People don't care for
their own children nowadays.

452
00:35:55,097 --> 00:35:59,253
Who sheds tears for
a son that is not their own?

453
00:36:00,463 --> 00:36:04,680
You like torturing the
people you love. Go ahead.

454
00:36:04,874 --> 00:36:06,323
Torture them as much as you want.

455
00:36:07,363 --> 00:36:10,877
What a stupid fellow!
You'll send me to my grave.

456
00:36:26,716 --> 00:36:29,235
If you stop crying,
I want to talk to you.

457
00:36:30,241 --> 00:36:33,549
My mother didn't breastfeed me,
comb my hair or dress me.

458
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:38,008
She didn't feed me
or even give me a kiss.

459
00:36:39,002 --> 00:36:42,105
Because my mother died
as soon as I was born.

460
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,180
I didn't even know what
my mother's touch feels like.

461
00:36:45,262 --> 00:36:48,262
I grew up without tasting
any of these things.

462
00:36:49,851 --> 00:36:52,813
Maybe that's why I don't
care about the word mother.

463
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:57,066
Mother, they say that
God created mothers..

464
00:36:57,146 --> 00:36:58,765
..because he can't be
in all the places at once.

465
00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:01,141
But he took my mother away.

466
00:37:02,071 --> 00:37:05,909
So, I don't have faith
in God or my mother who left me.

467
00:37:06,439 --> 00:37:09,116
That was the wretched state
of my life before you came.

468
00:37:10,164 --> 00:37:12,445
I thought that you
only cared about my father.

469
00:37:12,618 --> 00:37:16,964
I didn't realize that
you care about me too.

470
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:20,842
A man cannot get used to
something that he doesn't have.

471
00:37:21,642 --> 00:37:25,015
I didn't get used to a
mother because I didn't have one.

472
00:37:25,717 --> 00:37:29,136
It wasn't my intention
to shout at you or hurt you.

473
00:37:30,174 --> 00:37:32,639
I don't know if you've
noticed this or not..

474
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:35,493
..but unknowingly I called
you mother a few times.

475
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,380
I will continue to call you that.

476
00:37:41,548 --> 00:37:44,002
Why are you still crying?
Let's go inside.

477
00:37:44,672 --> 00:37:46,737
Come on, get up.

478
00:37:48,992 --> 00:37:50,917
I'll never shout at you again.

479
00:37:53,003 --> 00:37:55,425
He just needs an excuse to drink.

480
00:37:55,911 --> 00:37:59,425
Father! You've to drink
when you are happy or sad, right?

481
00:37:59,803 --> 00:38:01,630
Should I change myself for you?

482
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:06,441
She's my mother. The girl
who went to college is my sister.

483
00:38:06,633 --> 00:38:09,152
You and I know who you are.

484
00:38:09,232 --> 00:38:10,406
This is my family.

485
00:38:13,606 --> 00:38:15,260
This is what I've been hoping for.

486
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,363
Yeah, right.

487
00:38:16,558 --> 00:38:21,312
Mother, many have insulted
me for not having a mother.

488
00:38:21,392 --> 00:38:23,334
I'll introduce you to
the whole village. Come on.

489
00:38:23,414 --> 00:38:24,566
Okay, son.

490
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,685
Now I'll drink with happiness.

491
00:38:33,364 --> 00:38:34,910
Aunt, she's my mother!
- Okay.

492
00:38:36,651 --> 00:38:37,440
Uncle!
- Yes, son?

493
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,891
You always said I don't
have a mother, right?

494
00:38:38,915 --> 00:38:39,920
Here's my mother.

495
00:38:40,104 --> 00:38:43,423
Okay, Okay. Go ahead.

496
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:45,629
Buddy, she's my mother.

497
00:38:45,964 --> 00:38:47,077
Okay.

498
00:38:47,466 --> 00:38:49,175
Grandfather, she's my mother.

499
00:38:49,255 --> 00:38:50,255
That's good, son.

500
00:38:51,126 --> 00:38:51,861
Let's go there.

501
00:38:52,044 --> 00:38:54,336
Manamma! She's my mother.

502
00:38:54,963 --> 00:38:57,720
Tell the whole village
that I've a mother too.

503
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,990
Definitely, you go home.
I'll announce it.

504
00:39:08,518 --> 00:39:10,735
Why did you bring me here?
Let's go home.

505
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:12,581
I've to introduce
you to one more person.

506
00:39:13,975 --> 00:39:17,359
Why didn't she come?
Didn't she go to college today?

507
00:39:18,927 --> 00:39:20,008
Who is it?

508
00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:22,735
The person I wanted
you to meet is not here.

509
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:24,679
I'll introduce them later. Let's go home.
- Okay.

510
00:39:59,858 --> 00:40:01,578
Why are you standing out here?
What's wrong?

511
00:40:01,783 --> 00:40:03,874
My daughter hasn't
come home from college.

512
00:40:03,954 --> 00:40:05,171
I'm very worried.

513
00:40:05,251 --> 00:40:06,362
Your daughter didn't come home too?

514
00:40:06,386 --> 00:40:09,182
None of the girls from
this village came home.

515
00:40:09,712 --> 00:40:10,836
How can that be possible?

516
00:40:11,766 --> 00:40:13,993
Okay, you go inside.
I'll find out what happened.

517
00:40:30,585 --> 00:40:32,607
Did you see the girls
from Chintalapudi take a bus?

518
00:40:32,687 --> 00:40:33,687
I don't know.

519
00:40:35,431 --> 00:40:37,853
Brother! Did you see the
girls from Chintalapudi take a bus?

520
00:40:37,933 --> 00:40:38,933
I don't know.

521
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:43,599
Uncle! Uncle!

522
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:45,422
Did you see the girls
from Chintalapudi take a bus?

523
00:40:45,446 --> 00:40:46,606
I didn't see anyone.

524
00:40:51,709 --> 00:40:54,206
Uncle! Did you see the girls
from Chintalapudi take a bus?

525
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:55,286
I didn't see them.

526
00:40:59,301 --> 00:41:01,097
You spend the whole day here.
How could you not know?

527
00:41:01,121 --> 00:41:03,106
I said I don't know. Get lost.

528
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:23,856
Son!

529
00:41:24,473 --> 00:41:26,073
Why do you look so worried?

530
00:41:26,386 --> 00:41:28,031
The girls from our
village are not home yet.

531
00:41:28,055 --> 00:41:30,221
Who? Those girls from Chintalapudi?

532
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,853
Yes, sir. How do you know?

533
00:41:32,351 --> 00:41:33,356
Wait a minute.

534
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:44,181
It looked suspicious to me,
so I took a video.

535
00:41:45,819 --> 00:41:48,014
The bus to Chintalapudi
broke down at the outskirts.

536
00:41:48,094 --> 00:41:50,056
This vehicle is going there.
You can get in if you want.

537
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,827
Shall we go?
- Okay, let's go.

538
00:42:07,466 --> 00:42:09,133
Sir, just a minute. I'll be right back.

539
00:42:12,751 --> 00:42:13,751
Give that to me.

540
00:42:14,376 --> 00:42:15,660
And give me your pen.

541
00:42:27,603 --> 00:42:29,146
You are the only one
I know who used his phone..

542
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:31,603
..like it should be used. See you.

543
00:42:34,699 --> 00:42:35,983
Parvati!

544
00:42:42,469 --> 00:42:43,726
Parvati!

545
00:42:48,213 --> 00:42:49,524
Parvati!

546
00:43:14,687 --> 00:43:16,025
Parvati!

547
00:43:23,755 --> 00:43:25,282
Help me up.

548
00:43:25,552 --> 00:43:30,765
I pay the bill every day,
so you pay it today.

549
00:43:31,049 --> 00:43:36,616
You pay the bill every
day because I win the bet.

550
00:43:36,696 --> 00:43:39,157
Otherwise I would've paid it.

551
00:43:39,887 --> 00:43:43,646
I shouldn't be betting
with a man who drinks on bets.

552
00:43:43,726 --> 00:43:47,754
But I will win today.
- Is that so?

553
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:50,024
I will make you pay the bill.
Wait and watch.

554
00:43:50,104 --> 00:43:52,984
Stop boasting. What's your bet?

555
00:43:56,859 --> 00:44:00,643
I've to win today.
Why can't I see anyone around?

556
00:44:05,778 --> 00:44:08,334
He's gulping it down
without even wincing.

557
00:44:09,793 --> 00:44:11,942
I'll bet on him. Hey, listen to me.

558
00:44:13,131 --> 00:44:14,509
Can you see him?

559
00:44:16,874 --> 00:44:18,274
The one who's wiping his moustache.

560
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:19,793
You should make him laugh.

561
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:26,058
That's it? If I start singing..

562
00:44:26,598 --> 00:44:30,558
..everyone will laugh so
much that they will start crying.

563
00:44:30,774 --> 00:44:33,396
Wait and watch.

564
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:39,597
Hey! Hey, man! Hello!

565
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:45,246
"You are drinking, my man.
There's so much in store for you."

566
00:44:45,472 --> 00:44:50,823
"You are drinking, my man.
There's so much in store for you."

567
00:44:50,903 --> 00:44:56,093
"Liquor is so intoxicating,
I'm always first in line."

568
00:44:56,173 --> 00:44:59,310
"Drink and dance with me."

569
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:04,460
"Let's drink, my man.
Let's drink and sway."

570
00:45:04,811 --> 00:45:10,257
"Pour me a drink,
my throat has gone dry."

571
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,608
"You are drinking, my man.."

572
00:45:13,429 --> 00:45:18,511
I'm already irritated and
you are adding fuel to the fire.

573
00:45:18,713 --> 00:45:21,173
Do you know what I'm going through?
How dare you sing..

574
00:45:21,253 --> 00:45:25,417
Brother! He's drunk, please forgive him.

575
00:45:25,968 --> 00:45:30,076
Come here, brother. Sit here.

576
00:45:30,684 --> 00:45:32,927
Drink this. Go ahead, drink it.

577
00:45:34,697 --> 00:45:36,251
You fool.

578
00:45:39,317 --> 00:45:41,709
Now tell me. What's wrong?

579
00:45:42,385 --> 00:45:44,505
The college girls of our
village didn't come home yet.

580
00:45:44,817 --> 00:45:46,844
One of them is the girl I love.

581
00:45:47,142 --> 00:45:50,142
I'm so worried about her
that I'm shivering from inside.

582
00:45:50,761 --> 00:45:55,626
I've been searching the
roads like a mad man for this car.

583
00:45:56,842 --> 00:45:58,682
This looks like our
Ramesh's car number, right?

584
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:00,748
Yes, that's his car.

585
00:46:00,828 --> 00:46:02,708
Yes, it's definitely his car.
- Do you know him?

586
00:46:02,998 --> 00:46:05,241
I used to hang out with them before.

587
00:46:05,321 --> 00:46:06,622
I left the gang to
settle down in my life..

588
00:46:06,646 --> 00:46:08,365
..but I got married
and ruined my life instead.

589
00:46:08,389 --> 00:46:09,554
Who asked you about your marriage?

590
00:46:09,578 --> 00:46:10,578
Where will I find them?

591
00:46:10,782 --> 00:46:13,222
They will be in a shed beside
the water tank at the outskirts.

592
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:17,646
You won't get beaten
up if you tell what you know..

593
00:46:17,726 --> 00:46:19,902
..without dragging it. Take care.

594
00:46:24,011 --> 00:46:27,065
He said don't drag it out.
- That's right.

595
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,699
The vehicle will come
at 9 tomorrow morning.

596
00:46:55,703 --> 00:46:58,770
Keep them here till then
and put them in that vehicle.

597
00:47:26,237 --> 00:47:29,237
Don't worry. Koti is here.

598
00:47:30,196 --> 00:47:33,102
He'll beat up every one of them.

599
00:47:35,676 --> 00:47:40,393
The smiles on their faces
tell me that he's from that village.

600
00:47:42,149 --> 00:47:46,203
How can we start our
business if he stands here?

601
00:47:46,283 --> 00:47:48,176
Pack him away.

602
00:47:48,389 --> 00:47:52,902
Is that so? I'll pack you away,
you rascals. Come on.

603
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:12,334
Rascals! You want the girls?

604
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:25,431
I'll chop off your limbs.

605
00:50:15,889 --> 00:50:19,605
Why do you want to ruin the beer?
Give it to me!

606
00:51:24,424 --> 00:51:26,316
I see an auto coming.

607
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,951
Maybe the girls are coming home.

608
00:51:35,464 --> 00:51:36,667
Get down.

609
00:51:36,747 --> 00:51:37,491
You are home.

610
00:51:37,571 --> 00:51:40,059
Don't worry, uncle.
The bus broke down at the outskirts.

611
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:41,924
I brought them home.

612
00:51:42,194 --> 00:51:44,397
I would've died if
something happened to her.

613
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:46,357
Uncle, this is a village.
We all are one family.

614
00:51:48,036 --> 00:51:50,684
Alright, it's already very late.
Go home and sleep.

615
00:52:07,436 --> 00:52:08,828
Wait. What's the matter?

616
00:52:09,233 --> 00:52:13,187
If you hadn't come..
I just can't bear the thought..

617
00:52:13,267 --> 00:52:15,646
Look, I can't stay
away from you even an hour.

618
00:52:15,916 --> 00:52:18,443
How can I not come for
you if you are missing for hours?

619
00:52:18,523 --> 00:52:19,525
I'll definitely come.

620
00:52:19,605 --> 00:52:21,727
Hey, stop it.

621
00:52:21,807 --> 00:52:23,592
Your kisses are making me crazy.

622
00:52:23,672 --> 00:52:25,686
If you don't stop,
I won't be responsible for my actions.

623
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:29,521
Since it is already done,
it is not wrong to do it again.

624
00:52:29,601 --> 00:52:31,980
Then, I can't wait anymore.

625
00:53:01,577 --> 00:53:06,066
"O Koti, come and see me."

626
00:53:06,146 --> 00:53:10,499
"I like the way you sweetly torture me."

627
00:53:10,756 --> 00:53:15,215
"Handsome man, you are crazy."

628
00:53:15,295 --> 00:53:19,655
"I'm missing you,
you make me pine for you."

629
00:53:19,858 --> 00:53:24,331
"I'm blooming like a flower."

630
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:29,155
"I'm like a crop that's
swaying to the wind."

631
00:53:56,729 --> 00:54:01,161
"If you walk ahead of
me and show me the way.."

632
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:05,783
"I'll walk to the ends of the earth."

633
00:54:05,863 --> 00:54:10,174
"I can't think of anything
else when you are with me."

634
00:54:10,526 --> 00:54:14,593
"I've realized that you are my life."

635
00:54:14,673 --> 00:54:19,147
"Your breath has surrounded
me like a protection."

636
00:54:19,227 --> 00:54:24,382
"I'll wrap myself around
you and remain yours."

637
00:54:32,977 --> 00:54:37,254
"O Koti, come and see me."

638
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:41,835
"I like the way you sweetly torture me."

639
00:54:42,118 --> 00:54:46,618
"Handsome man, you are crazy."

640
00:54:46,698 --> 00:54:50,899
"I'm missing you,
you make me pine for you."

641
00:55:09,887 --> 00:55:14,441
"When I look into your
eyes and lean on you.."

642
00:55:14,521 --> 00:55:18,985
"I come to you like a
wave that comes to the shore."

643
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:23,552
"After you shower me with
your love and satisfy me.."

644
00:55:23,632 --> 00:55:27,782
"my body yearns
for your warmth again."

645
00:55:27,862 --> 00:55:32,274
"I've locked you up inside my heart."

646
00:55:32,354 --> 00:55:37,571
"I want to be with
you today and forever."

647
00:55:46,101 --> 00:55:50,642
"O Koti, come and see me."

648
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:55,169
"I like the way you sweetly torture me."

649
00:55:55,249 --> 00:55:59,798
"Handsome man, you are crazy."

650
00:55:59,878 --> 00:56:04,406
"I'm missing you,
you make me pine for you."

651
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:33,335
When the priest told us about
your family, we were ecstatic.

652
00:56:33,619 --> 00:56:35,209
It is a great honor
for us that your family..

653
00:56:35,233 --> 00:56:37,058
Here comes the girl.

654
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:39,153
What did she study?

655
00:56:39,477 --> 00:56:41,220
She completed graduation.

656
00:56:42,936 --> 00:56:43,963
Give them tea, dear.

657
00:56:44,043 --> 00:56:48,958
She's a very quiet girl.
Her mother raised her well.

658
00:56:49,161 --> 00:56:51,201
She's a very good girl.

659
00:56:51,418 --> 00:56:54,258
Give a cup to the priest and sit down.
- 'Oh, this is the boy's family.'

660
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,229
She cooks well too.

661
00:57:01,786 --> 00:57:04,516
Mosquitoes in your house
bite during the day too?

662
00:57:05,719 --> 00:57:08,900
Is it just in your
house or the whole village?

663
00:57:09,413 --> 00:57:12,494
We are still here because
the girl is beautiful..

664
00:57:12,574 --> 00:57:16,089
..but otherwise..
I would have returned immediately.

665
00:57:16,169 --> 00:57:18,008
What do you say, dad?
- That's right.

666
00:57:18,805 --> 00:57:20,224
The girl..
- I need to talk to you.

667
00:57:24,335 --> 00:57:25,389
Talk.

668
00:57:25,469 --> 00:57:27,605
Not here, in private.

669
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:29,943
Looks like a crazy man.

670
00:57:30,023 --> 00:57:32,632
Let's go. Let's see what he has to say.

671
00:57:34,505 --> 00:57:35,505
What's the matter?

672
00:57:35,571 --> 00:57:36,897
Come with me, I'll tell you.

673
00:57:36,977 --> 00:57:37,977
Oh!

674
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:40,059
Are you from Hyderabad?

675
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:42,802
Why is he looking around
instead of talking?

676
00:57:45,937 --> 00:57:48,000
What is wrong with you?

677
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:50,892
I brought you here because
I didn't want to make you cry there.

678
00:57:51,622 --> 00:57:53,582
My sister will come to
your house after marriage..

679
00:57:53,648 --> 00:57:56,527
..you won't come here.
So, why talk about this house?

680
00:57:57,581 --> 00:58:00,811
Remember one thing. Marry a girl..

681
00:58:00,891 --> 00:58:04,417
..who will love you with her heart,
not her mind.

682
00:58:04,755 --> 00:58:08,214
If you focus on anything else,
your life will be ruined.

683
00:58:08,552 --> 00:58:10,863
Farmers are kings.

684
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,363
Don't you know how to behave..

685
00:58:12,443 --> 00:58:13,984
..when you come to a king's house?

686
00:58:14,216 --> 00:58:16,459
Show respect. Learn good manners.

687
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:18,743
Let's go.

688
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,932
Smile.

689
00:58:26,317 --> 00:58:30,019
Dad, I like the girl. If you
like her too, fix the wedding date.

690
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,898
Let's go, dad.

691
00:58:32,911 --> 00:58:34,235
What happened to him?

692
00:58:35,249 --> 00:58:36,627
See you later.

693
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:39,006
Okay, madam. Okay, sir.

694
00:58:40,076 --> 00:58:43,900
What did you tell him?
Why did they suddenly leave?

695
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:47,467
I spoke to him in a way
that he understands, father.

696
00:58:47,547 --> 00:58:48,927
I got it.

697
00:58:50,008 --> 00:58:51,103
Parvati!

698
00:58:57,282 --> 00:58:58,809
Why is she crying?

699
00:58:59,917 --> 00:59:02,673
Hey.. Are you crying?

700
00:59:02,944 --> 00:59:04,552
What's wrong? Tell me.

701
00:59:05,576 --> 00:59:07,751
Today is the day my father died.

702
00:59:08,238 --> 00:59:10,076
What? You told me he went out of town..

703
00:59:10,156 --> 00:59:11,556
..because your grandmother is sick.

704
00:59:11,751 --> 00:59:13,805
I liked you the moment I saw you.

705
00:59:14,292 --> 00:59:20,172
I didn't want to tell you
all my troubles and make you sad.

706
00:59:20,252 --> 00:59:22,469
Even now I didn't want to tell you..

707
00:59:22,753 --> 00:59:25,442
..but I don't have anyone
else to share my sorrow with.

708
00:59:25,753 --> 00:59:27,145
That's why I told you.

709
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:33,937
Don't cry.
Your tears won't bring him back.

710
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:37,275
I love my father very much.

711
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,734
A girl lives a carefree life
as long as her parents are alive.

712
00:59:42,423 --> 00:59:46,396
But without them,
she lives every moment in fear.

713
00:59:47,756 --> 00:59:50,743
Look, when you are in fear and sorrow..

714
00:59:50,823 --> 00:59:52,716
..I can't take you
in my arms and comfort you.

715
00:59:52,919 --> 00:59:57,175
I can't say that I like you
and that I can't live without you.

716
00:59:57,432 --> 00:59:59,216
But I can assure you of one thing.

717
01:00:00,567 --> 01:00:03,027
Don't shed tears and
lose your dad's memory.

718
01:00:03,310 --> 01:00:05,513
Hide your tears and cherish his memory.

719
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:08,094
Be brave if you trust me.

720
01:00:08,986 --> 01:00:12,743
I'm living for you, Koti.

721
01:00:13,821 --> 01:00:16,700
And I'll continue to live only for you.

722
01:00:20,051 --> 01:00:24,159
Then why are you still crying?
Come here. Come on.

723
01:00:27,328 --> 01:00:30,450
I came with other plans,
but you changed everything.

724
01:00:34,369 --> 01:00:35,909
Koti!
- Yes?

725
01:00:36,396 --> 01:00:37,992
How long has it been
since we both sat down..

726
01:00:38,016 --> 01:00:39,376
..at the riverbed and had a drink?

727
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,340
You disappear every night.
Where do you go?

728
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:45,354
What is the fun in
having a drink with a man?

729
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:46,734
You need to do something more thrilling.

730
01:00:46,758 --> 01:00:48,003
Really? What are you doing?

731
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:49,315
What's the hurry?
I'll tell you when the time comes.

732
01:00:49,339 --> 01:00:50,381
Okay.

733
01:00:50,461 --> 01:00:51,690
Shall we drink tonight?
- You have to buy it.

734
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:54,121
Brother, stop! A snake bit my mother!

735
01:00:54,201 --> 01:00:55,458
Where is she?
- At home.

736
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:02,796
Lady! Lady, get up!
- Mother, get up!

737
01:01:02,876 --> 01:01:04,351
Get up!

738
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:06,189
Get up!

739
01:01:07,257 --> 01:01:08,392
Mother..

740
01:01:10,013 --> 01:01:14,148
A girl lives a carefree life
as long as her parents are alive.

741
01:01:14,851 --> 01:01:19,342
But without them,
she lives every moment in fear.

742
01:01:19,422 --> 01:01:22,572
Mother! Mother, wake up!

743
01:01:22,652 --> 01:01:26,585
Mother! Mother!

744
01:01:27,545 --> 01:01:29,173
Don't be scared. I'll be right back.

745
01:01:29,253 --> 01:01:30,767
Okay.

746
01:01:31,159 --> 01:01:32,916
Where are you coming? Stay with her.

747
01:01:32,996 --> 01:01:34,064
Okay.

748
01:01:45,582 --> 01:01:47,244
Aunt! Aunt!

749
01:01:47,433 --> 01:01:48,609
What is it?

750
01:01:48,866 --> 01:01:50,568
Where is uncle? I need the bike.

751
01:01:50,947 --> 01:01:51,947
He's gone to the fields.

752
01:01:55,533 --> 01:01:57,641
Uncle! Uncle!

753
01:01:57,965 --> 01:01:58,965
Yes, Koti?

754
01:01:59,114 --> 01:01:59,898
Do you have your bike?

755
01:01:59,978 --> 01:02:01,178
My son took it to the college.

756
01:02:05,492 --> 01:02:09,316
Dhamu! Hey.. Darn!

757
01:02:10,578 --> 01:02:12,322
Uncle! Uncle!

758
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,308
Yes, brother?
- Is your father home?

759
01:02:14,388 --> 01:02:15,727
No, he went out.

760
01:02:16,889 --> 01:02:18,038
Nobody is at home!

761
01:02:33,223 --> 01:02:36,441
Chandu! Chandu! Chandu!

762
01:02:36,658 --> 01:02:38,833
Yes, I'm coming.

763
01:02:38,913 --> 01:02:41,995
Give me your car.
A snake bit a woman in the next street.

764
01:02:42,075 --> 01:02:44,671
Don't get into all that.
I've to leave for Hyderabad tonight.

765
01:02:44,751 --> 01:02:47,198
You've to leave tonight, right?
I'll be back in an hour.

766
01:02:47,387 --> 01:02:48,725
A woman is dying there.

767
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:52,093
What if she dies in my car?
I don't want that bad omen.

768
01:02:52,173 --> 01:02:54,161
Why are you thinking about her dying?

769
01:02:54,241 --> 01:02:55,769
I want to save her life.

770
01:02:55,849 --> 01:02:58,526
I don't love the village like you do.
Leave me alone.

771
01:02:58,606 --> 01:02:59,688
Chandu!

772
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:01,202
Chandu!

773
01:03:01,282 --> 01:03:02,282
Rascal!

774
01:03:13,137 --> 01:03:14,462
Stop the tractor!

775
01:03:14,542 --> 01:03:15,449
What's wrong?

776
01:03:15,529 --> 01:03:17,516
I said stop! I want the tractor!

777
01:03:17,596 --> 01:03:18,449
I have to go to the fields.

778
01:03:18,529 --> 01:03:20,260
You can do that later. Get down.

779
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,363
Mother, wake up.

780
01:04:26,443 --> 01:04:27,660
Doctor, please check.

781
01:04:37,782 --> 01:04:39,147
She died on the way.

782
01:04:40,985 --> 01:04:41,985
Mother!

783
01:04:47,253 --> 01:04:50,348
Mother, wake up.

784
01:05:06,744 --> 01:05:08,189
Koti, what are you doing?

785
01:05:27,625 --> 01:05:28,733
Chandu!

786
01:05:33,355 --> 01:05:36,585
Chandu, open the door! Open the door!

787
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:39,338
What now?

788
01:05:39,418 --> 01:05:41,054
What now?

789
01:05:42,541 --> 01:05:44,879
She's dead! You killed her!

790
01:05:47,365 --> 01:05:50,352
She wouldn't have died
if I had beaten you up earlier!

791
01:05:50,622 --> 01:05:53,176
She's dead but I won't let anybody die.

792
01:05:53,256 --> 01:05:54,505
Give me the car key!
- I won't!

793
01:05:55,221 --> 01:05:56,856
I know you won't give if I ask nicely.

794
01:06:01,221 --> 01:06:03,018
Will you give me the
key or die in my hands?

795
01:06:04,329 --> 01:06:05,329
Take it.

796
01:06:49,013 --> 01:06:51,959
Give me the mic! Hurry up!

797
01:06:56,594 --> 01:07:00,219
All the villagers come
out for a minute! Hurry up!

798
01:07:02,043 --> 01:07:06,530
What is he up to now?
- Come on, let's see.

799
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:10,381
This is our ambulance
and service van from today.

800
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:13,638
Today a woman died of a snake bite.

801
01:07:13,718 --> 01:07:17,395
It wasn't the fault
of the snake or the woman.

802
01:07:17,759 --> 01:07:19,651
Our village doesn't have the means..

803
01:07:19,867 --> 01:07:21,288
..to take a sick person
to the hospital on time.

804
01:07:21,312 --> 01:07:22,707
That's where this ambulance comes in.

805
01:07:22,731 --> 01:07:25,313
Nobody in this village should die.

806
01:07:26,801 --> 01:07:27,923
Take it.

807
01:07:29,436 --> 01:07:32,504
Don't be sad as if I took
away your life or your money.

808
01:07:32,909 --> 01:07:35,572
We all will collect money
and give you 15,000 a month.

809
01:07:35,652 --> 01:07:37,004
Work for this village.

810
01:07:37,216 --> 01:07:39,257
From today,
saving lives will be your job.

811
01:07:39,337 --> 01:07:41,621
Where will you find
a better job than this?

812
01:07:42,162 --> 01:07:45,297
Remember one thing.
If there is one thing in this world..

813
01:07:45,377 --> 01:07:47,986
..that cannot be brought back once lost,
it is life.

814
01:07:48,066 --> 01:07:51,486
Nothing is more important than life.
Let's go.

815
01:07:53,405 --> 01:07:54,661
Pathetic!

816
01:07:58,715 --> 01:08:00,013
Sir, did you want to see me?

817
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:04,445
There's a function at my house tomorrow.

818
01:08:04,659 --> 01:08:06,259
I was wondering what the menu should be.

819
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:07,875
Sir?

820
01:08:08,456 --> 01:08:11,673
Exactly. It's been 3 months
since those 72 people died.

821
01:08:11,929 --> 01:08:13,580
You haven't submitted
even one report till now.

822
01:08:13,604 --> 01:08:14,686
What should I call you?

823
01:08:14,943 --> 01:08:18,209
Sir, they didn't kill one or two person,
they killed 72 people.

824
01:08:19,682 --> 01:08:22,506
They did it fearlessly
without any planning.

825
01:08:22,898 --> 01:08:26,046
They took all the precautions
to cover their tracks.

826
01:08:26,126 --> 01:08:27,776
That's why it's taking time.

827
01:08:27,856 --> 01:08:29,346
If it was a city or town, we could've..

828
01:08:29,370 --> 01:08:31,721
..at least had CCTV
footage or some information.

829
01:08:31,964 --> 01:08:34,099
That's why they targeted the villages.

830
01:08:34,599 --> 01:08:37,964
Even in villages,
everybody has gold on their bodies.

831
01:08:38,221 --> 01:08:41,626
So they will definitely
target another village.

832
01:08:42,032 --> 01:08:44,495
I'll target that
village before they can.

833
01:08:45,008 --> 01:08:48,116
I'll catch them red-handed.
Please give me some time.

834
01:08:50,157 --> 01:08:51,738
Hmm.

835
01:10:41,345 --> 01:10:42,345
Boss!

836
01:10:44,588 --> 01:10:45,588
What?

837
01:10:45,818 --> 01:10:48,399
I have a feeling that
someone is following us.

838
01:10:49,183 --> 01:10:53,061
Every criminal feels
that he's being watched.

839
01:10:53,141 --> 01:10:54,440
That's not your fault.

840
01:10:55,343 --> 01:10:57,965
You are new, you'll get used to it.

841
01:10:59,302 --> 01:11:01,046
Are we going to do it tomorrow?

842
01:11:01,126 --> 01:11:05,073
Let's wait a few days.
Let's study this village and..

843
01:11:05,262 --> 01:11:06,829
..note how many houses it has.

844
01:11:07,098 --> 01:11:09,843
Once we have all the
details we can do our job.

845
01:11:09,923 --> 01:11:12,335
Until then, we need to be careful.

846
01:11:28,077 --> 01:11:29,850
Boss! Boss!
- What is it?

847
01:11:30,154 --> 01:11:32,992
I told you that someone is following us.

848
01:11:33,837 --> 01:11:35,104
Look how they beat me up.

849
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:39,665
Maybe you got drunk and
ran into a wall last night.

850
01:11:39,745 --> 01:11:41,825
You think we wouldn't
notice if someone beats you up?

851
01:11:43,949 --> 01:11:47,530
Fear is dangerous.
Put that aside and you'll be fine.

852
01:11:49,190 --> 01:11:50,761
Crazy fellow.

853
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:54,275
No, somebody is here.

854
01:12:10,919 --> 01:12:12,034
What is this?

855
01:12:12,997 --> 01:12:15,480
Father!

856
01:12:15,919 --> 01:12:17,439
Father!

857
01:12:17,845 --> 01:12:19,449
What is this?

858
01:12:20,176 --> 01:12:21,291
Open it.

859
01:12:29,164 --> 01:12:31,614
Father! A Bullet!

860
01:12:32,053 --> 01:12:35,381
Your mother mortgaged
her bangles to buy it.

861
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,793
Mother! Why so much love?
I can't digest it.

862
01:12:39,131 --> 01:12:42,357
Tone it down.
Anyway, since you bought it..

863
01:12:42,796 --> 01:12:45,267
..I'll ride it.
I'll ride it around the village.

864
01:12:58,520 --> 01:12:59,448
Did you see how happy he is?

865
01:12:59,528 --> 01:13:02,928
It's a new bike,
take God's blessings on the way.

866
01:13:03,147 --> 01:13:04,600
I can't go to the God now.

867
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,985
Why?
- I've to go to my Goddess.

868
01:13:06,065 --> 01:13:07,759
"Did you come to our house,
Lord Krishna?"

869
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:11,492
"Did you come to see your Radha?"

870
01:13:11,572 --> 01:13:14,532
"The Goddess has fulfilled my dream."

871
01:13:14,612 --> 01:13:17,511
"Koti's life has been blessed."

872
01:13:17,591 --> 01:13:20,805
"Let's go around town
and make everyone jealous."

873
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:24,657
"Come with me."

874
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:35,219
"Come with me, fly with me."

875
01:13:35,299 --> 01:13:40,946
"Hop on the bike and
break all boundaries."

876
01:13:41,026 --> 01:13:44,409
"Look into my eyes."

877
01:13:44,489 --> 01:13:50,423
"He changed his style
and became even faster."

878
01:13:50,503 --> 01:13:56,622
"Even the soda bubbles
up when he is near."

879
01:13:56,702 --> 01:14:03,041
"He is like the wind."

880
01:14:26,486 --> 01:14:29,697
"My beautiful parrot
is sitting on a tree."

881
01:14:32,653 --> 01:14:35,880
"I can't keep my hands off of her."

882
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:44,511
"Time is flying but
I don't want to go home."

883
01:14:44,765 --> 01:14:50,471
"The wind is calling out to
me and your scarf is like a sail."

884
01:14:50,551 --> 01:14:53,984
"Let's see the sunset from a boat."

885
01:14:54,064 --> 01:14:59,356
"Come with me, fly with me."

886
01:14:59,436 --> 01:15:02,018
"Hop on the bike and
break all boundaries."

887
01:15:02,098 --> 01:15:05,502
"Look into my eyes."

888
01:15:05,582 --> 01:15:11,309
"Lord Gopala!
How can I stop myself today?"

889
01:15:11,389 --> 01:15:17,433
"I just want my girl
to be with me day and night."

890
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:20,527
"Swaying fields are
saying something to us."

891
01:15:20,607 --> 01:15:23,441
"Her sweet laughter
is music to my ears."

892
01:15:23,695 --> 01:15:26,883
"This lonely village
has given me my mate."

893
01:15:49,713 --> 01:15:52,246
Be ready. I'll be right back.

894
01:16:03,198 --> 01:16:04,824
Looks like you took bath.

895
01:16:06,809 --> 01:16:11,095
Parvati! Make me an
omelet with lots of onions.

896
01:16:11,175 --> 01:16:14,072
Okay.
- I'll have a drink. Go on.

897
01:16:14,888 --> 01:16:17,802
Such a beautiful night.

898
01:16:29,014 --> 01:16:30,450
Where's the omelet?

899
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:32,597
Stop drinking and smoking from today.

900
01:16:32,677 --> 01:16:35,363
Stop them?
Do you know what you are saying?

901
01:16:35,443 --> 01:16:36,799
What is this new demand?

902
01:16:37,179 --> 01:16:40,895
It is not new.
We both should get to know each other..

903
01:16:40,975 --> 01:16:43,429
..that's why I didn't
object to your habits.

904
01:16:43,809 --> 01:16:48,074
I knew you would say
this one day and you said it.

905
01:16:48,154 --> 01:16:49,299
You are a woman after all.

906
01:16:49,379 --> 01:16:51,706
This is what you do in the end.

907
01:16:52,904 --> 01:16:54,424
What happens to women?

908
01:16:54,504 --> 01:16:56,195
You are fine the first
three to four months.

909
01:16:56,219 --> 01:16:58,668
What happens after that?
A demon possesses you?

910
01:16:58,748 --> 01:17:00,189
Why are you shouting at me?

911
01:17:00,484 --> 01:17:02,701
I want to spend my whole life with you.

912
01:17:03,102 --> 01:17:05,087
Is it wrong to expect
you to change some things?

913
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:08,170
Shut up! I want someone
who loves me as I am.

914
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:10,662
I don't want your love
if you are planning to change me.

915
01:17:11,055 --> 01:17:12,895
You were totally fine
with it in the beginning.

916
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:15,784
You poured me a drink,
made me an omelet and kissed me.

917
01:17:15,864 --> 01:17:18,867
And now you are pushing me into a well.

918
01:17:18,947 --> 01:17:20,599
Is it wrong to ask you to be a good man?

919
01:17:20,679 --> 01:17:22,964
I see. A man who drinks
is not a good man.

920
01:17:23,044 --> 01:17:24,611
A man who smokes is not a good man.

921
01:17:24,691 --> 01:17:26,933
A man who does as you say is a good man.

922
01:17:27,013 --> 01:17:32,056
Go find another man like that.
I won't change.

923
01:17:32,136 --> 01:17:36,216
I'm done talking to the
woman who wants to change me.

924
01:17:36,491 --> 01:17:37,652
Koti!

925
01:17:39,257 --> 01:17:41,157
I thought we'll break
another cot today..

926
01:17:41,237 --> 01:17:43,585
..but you broke my heart.

927
01:17:52,508 --> 01:17:54,873
Manamma! Hey!

928
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:56,604
Who is it?

929
01:17:56,984 --> 01:17:59,624
Come here. Hurry up.

930
01:17:59,704 --> 01:18:01,524
Wait a minute.

931
01:18:02,306 --> 01:18:04,607
You are always in a hurry.

932
01:18:04,924 --> 01:18:06,310
Why did you come here at this time?

933
01:18:06,334 --> 01:18:08,778
You were complaining that
I'm not drinking with you.

934
01:18:08,858 --> 01:18:10,382
We'll be together from now.

935
01:18:10,462 --> 01:18:13,592
You and I should never get married.
We'll be together.

936
01:18:14,310 --> 01:18:15,767
Usually change is limited to humans.

937
01:18:15,847 --> 01:18:17,160
I'm surprised to see it in you.

938
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:19,356
Shut up and hop on.

939
01:18:19,842 --> 01:18:22,355
Alright, let's go.

940
01:18:22,777 --> 01:18:24,445
Hold tight.

941
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:28,664
Manamma! When we were kids..

942
01:18:28,744 --> 01:18:30,860
..they taught us to
be careful with strangers.

943
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:33,267
Why didn't they warn
us to be careful with woman?

944
01:18:33,347 --> 01:18:35,780
I'm sure they were fooled by woman too.

945
01:18:36,034 --> 01:18:37,913
So, how can they warn us?

946
01:18:37,993 --> 01:18:39,855
They bend their heads till the wedding..

947
01:18:39,935 --> 01:18:42,600
..and live the rest of
their lives with raised heads.

948
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:44,997
We live with raised
heads till the wedding..

949
01:18:45,077 --> 01:18:47,256
..and live the rest of
our lives with bent heads.

950
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:49,114
What kind of a life is that?

951
01:18:49,194 --> 01:18:52,366
I don't know what you
are talking about and why.

952
01:18:52,446 --> 01:18:54,639
We should share our sorrow with someone
who doesn't understand it.

953
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:56,717
Sharing it with someone
who understands is pathetic.

954
01:18:56,797 --> 01:18:58,174
You are crazy.

955
01:18:58,829 --> 01:19:00,412
Koti! Koti!

956
01:19:00,492 --> 01:19:02,524
What?
- Someone is coming running.

957
01:19:05,649 --> 01:19:07,697
Aunt! What's wrong?
- Yes, Koti?

958
01:19:08,288 --> 01:19:11,498
Your uncle is sick.
I went to the next town for medicines.

959
01:19:11,578 --> 01:19:12,990
But somebody started
harassing me on the way.

960
01:19:13,014 --> 01:19:14,249
Okay, don't be scared.

961
01:19:14,329 --> 01:19:16,466
Manamma, drop her at home.

962
01:19:16,546 --> 01:19:18,556
Okay.
- Hurry up.

963
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:22,399
Come on, hurry.

964
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,060
Sit, aunt.

965
01:19:54,293 --> 01:19:56,025
Hey!

966
01:21:25,732 --> 01:21:27,167
What's the matter?

967
01:21:31,728 --> 01:21:35,381
Since it is night,
I went out to take a walk.

968
01:21:36,059 --> 01:21:38,487
But somebody chased me.

969
01:21:48,897 --> 01:21:50,565
Why did you kill our man, boss?

970
01:21:51,811 --> 01:21:54,140
If I know that I'm going
to die because of someone..

971
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:59,186
..I kill him first. Bury him right here.

972
01:22:02,037 --> 01:22:04,782
This village won't
be as easy as we thought.

973
01:22:05,358 --> 01:22:07,850
We'll start our work tomorrow.

974
01:22:47,895 --> 01:22:49,648
We came for census.

975
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:51,128
How many people live in this house?

976
01:23:24,419 --> 01:23:26,045
We came for census.

977
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,030
How many people live in this house?

978
01:25:48,764 --> 01:25:50,677
What are you doing here?

979
01:25:50,850 --> 01:25:54,762
Oh! You can go wherever
you want but I can't?

980
01:25:54,842 --> 01:25:57,443
You are crazy.
My father will skin me alive. Come on.

981
01:25:57,753 --> 01:25:58,758
I can't believe this.

982
01:25:58,838 --> 01:26:00,769
Where are you taking me?

983
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:05,708
What is it?

984
01:26:05,788 --> 01:26:07,330
Why are you avoiding me?

985
01:26:07,762 --> 01:26:09,740
Why meet when we decided
not to be together?

986
01:26:10,076 --> 01:26:11,167
So, you are leaving me?

987
01:26:11,247 --> 01:26:13,689
Of course.
You think I'll keep you on a pedestal..

988
01:26:13,769 --> 01:26:15,470
..if you ask me to
stop doing this and that?

989
01:26:15,494 --> 01:26:17,981
A woman is attractive
as long as she doesn't demand.

990
01:26:18,061 --> 01:26:20,208
Once she starts demanding,
it becomes irritating.

991
01:26:20,397 --> 01:26:24,084
Right, a woman is attractive
until she gives you what you want.

992
01:26:24,851 --> 01:26:27,878
But if she asks something out of love,
you get rid of her.

993
01:26:27,958 --> 01:26:30,570
I will leave my father too
if he asks me to stop drinking.

994
01:26:31,142 --> 01:26:33,206
This is what you do, Koti. I know you.

995
01:26:33,286 --> 01:26:35,673
You come when you want
and leave when you want.

996
01:26:35,753 --> 01:26:37,705
But you are my life,
how do I live without you?

997
01:26:37,785 --> 01:26:39,385
I didn't ask you to be with me.
Get lost.

998
01:26:40,199 --> 01:26:42,103
I offered you my body
every time you came home.

999
01:26:42,319 --> 01:26:43,656
Is that why you are
talking to me like this?

1000
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:45,928
What are you talking about?
Get lost! Go!

1001
01:26:53,643 --> 01:26:54,876
Darn!

1002
01:27:03,335 --> 01:27:05,325
Who are these men standing
before uncle's house?

1003
01:27:20,444 --> 01:27:21,796
What would've happened?

1004
01:27:21,990 --> 01:27:25,385
Just because my son made
your daughter pregnant..

1005
01:27:25,465 --> 01:27:28,641
..don't think that you
can get her married to him.

1006
01:27:28,890 --> 01:27:30,690
That's why I came here
to tell you personally.

1007
01:27:31,266 --> 01:27:34,542
I'll give you 2.5 million rupees.
Get her married and..

1008
01:27:34,622 --> 01:27:36,347
..put the rest in the bank on her name.

1009
01:27:36,427 --> 01:27:39,191
You'll get some interest every month,
you can live in peace.

1010
01:27:39,972 --> 01:27:42,470
But if you try to do something else..

1011
01:27:42,762 --> 01:27:44,870
..my men will burn your home to ashes.

1012
01:27:45,389 --> 01:27:46,389
Is that so?

1013
01:27:47,875 --> 01:27:52,546
My son should have used..
Some protection.

1014
01:27:55,011 --> 01:27:57,584
Then it wouldn't have come to this.

1015
01:27:57,940 --> 01:27:58,783
You rascal!

1016
01:27:58,863 --> 01:28:01,010
Who are you? What are you doing?

1017
01:28:01,453 --> 01:28:03,377
Why did you stand, sir? Sit down.

1018
01:28:03,659 --> 01:28:04,437
Let my son go.

1019
01:28:04,517 --> 01:28:06,340
It is not this poor guy's fault.

1020
01:28:06,610 --> 01:28:07,248
Stop it!

1021
01:28:07,328 --> 01:28:09,777
What was that?
Yes, if you had used protection..

1022
01:28:09,857 --> 01:28:11,480
..before giving birth to him..

1023
01:28:12,304 --> 01:28:14,021
..it wouldn't have come to this, sir.

1024
01:28:14,101 --> 01:28:15,331
Stop it!

1025
01:28:15,912 --> 01:28:16,940
Hey!

1026
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:18,764
Oh, right. There are more men.

1027
01:28:18,844 --> 01:28:20,530
Stop!

1028
01:28:22,743 --> 01:28:24,651
Anyone who has anger towards me..

1029
01:28:24,888 --> 01:28:28,874
..love for your boss
and faith in yourself..

1030
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:30,682
..step out and fight with me.

1031
01:28:30,762 --> 01:28:35,496
Because uncle very
hard to build this house.

1032
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:38,313
I can't bear to cause
damage to this house.

1033
01:28:38,668 --> 01:28:41,793
So, let's step out and fight.

1034
01:28:43,313 --> 01:28:44,985
Come on! Come!

1035
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:57,141
Go!

1036
01:31:27,351 --> 01:31:31,000
I bought them for my use,
not for your use.

1037
01:32:23,363 --> 01:32:24,523
Who are you looking for, sir?

1038
01:32:24,875 --> 01:32:26,361
You have to pick them up on your way.

1039
01:32:26,665 --> 01:32:32,679
Now listen carefully to me.
If I give you a punch..

1040
01:32:32,915 --> 01:32:34,515
..you are not a young man to survive it.

1041
01:32:34,655 --> 01:32:38,253
They are very old
to endure such heartache.

1042
01:32:38,333 --> 01:32:40,483
Why are you playing
games with their lives?

1043
01:32:41,519 --> 01:32:44,628
She gave herself to your
son because she trusted him.

1044
01:32:44,708 --> 01:32:47,246
You didn't understand, right?
I'll say it again.

1045
01:32:47,601 --> 01:32:51,317
She gave herself to your
son because she trusted him.

1046
01:32:51,604 --> 01:32:54,459
How can you find fault with that?

1047
01:32:54,898 --> 01:32:57,533
As far as I know,
your son likes her too.

1048
01:32:57,613 --> 01:32:58,888
What?

1049
01:33:00,661 --> 01:33:01,861
Did you see that?

1050
01:33:02,097 --> 01:33:05,239
So understand the situation
and get them married.

1051
01:33:05,319 --> 01:33:09,141
Otherwise I'll have to meet you again.

1052
01:33:09,411 --> 01:33:12,452
I'm sure you know how that will end.

1053
01:33:12,532 --> 01:33:15,636
See you later, sir.
Bye, uncle. Bye, dear.

1054
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:24,691
Sir, I said something
to you in my anger.

1055
01:33:24,771 --> 01:33:27,816
I lose control when I'm angry.
Can you remind me?

1056
01:33:28,542 --> 01:33:30,400
If you punch me..

1057
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:33,470
No, not about you, sir.
I said something about these two.

1058
01:33:34,517 --> 01:33:37,929
She gave herself to your
son because she trusted him.

1059
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:40,716
Is that the line?
- Yes, I hope you got it.

1060
01:33:40,953 --> 01:33:43,723
I got it too. Bye, sir. Bye.

1061
01:33:48,228 --> 01:33:50,610
I'm such an idiot.
My Parvati gave herself to me..

1062
01:33:50,690 --> 01:33:52,232
..because she loves me.

1063
01:33:52,519 --> 01:33:57,080
And I left her for alcohol
and cigarettes. Shame on me.

1064
01:33:57,401 --> 01:33:59,495
I have to make her love me again.

1065
01:34:19,359 --> 01:34:21,116
Where is she going?

1066
01:34:22,231 --> 01:34:24,883
Oh, I think she is still angry with me.

1067
01:34:27,417 --> 01:34:28,566
Get on the bike.

1068
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:31,032
What..

1069
01:34:35,557 --> 01:34:37,483
Why are you acting pricey?

1070
01:34:37,821 --> 01:34:39,661
I came back because
I have realized my mistake.

1071
01:34:39,763 --> 01:34:43,648
You want to vent out your anger,
right? Slap me.

1072
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:45,287
Ouch!

1073
01:34:49,594 --> 01:34:50,594
Slap me again.

1074
01:34:54,344 --> 01:34:55,847
How do you feel now?

1075
01:34:56,219 --> 01:34:58,145
Since I slapped you,
I'm no longer angry.

1076
01:34:58,601 --> 01:35:00,679
That's right. Since I slapped you once..

1077
01:35:00,759 --> 01:35:03,719
..you had to slap me twice to cool down.

1078
01:35:03,799 --> 01:35:05,763
Why are you walking?
Why didn't you take the bus?

1079
01:35:05,843 --> 01:35:09,582
I like to walk when I'm angry.

1080
01:35:09,662 --> 01:35:12,605
Right, why will take the
bus or train when you are angry?

1081
01:35:12,685 --> 01:35:14,616
You would prefer to ride on us.
Let's go.

1082
01:35:14,696 --> 01:35:17,014
I will never drink again in my life.
I swear on you.

1083
01:35:17,234 --> 01:35:18,940
Stop smiling and get on the bike.

1084
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:23,213
You girls always get what you want.
Hats off to you.

1085
01:35:23,567 --> 01:35:26,573
If you drink again,
you'll have me to answer to.

1086
01:35:41,553 --> 01:35:42,938
Okay then, I'll go.

1087
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:45,471
Will you come again?

1088
01:35:45,551 --> 01:35:46,857
Why?

1089
01:35:46,937 --> 01:35:48,580
Today is my birthday.

1090
01:35:49,492 --> 01:35:52,262
I was going to come anyway.
Now I'll definitely come.

1091
01:35:54,166 --> 01:35:55,602
Let's go.

1092
01:36:02,342 --> 01:36:05,146
Parvati! Parvati!

1093
01:36:08,191 --> 01:36:09,458
What is that?

1094
01:36:09,931 --> 01:36:13,090
I bought it long back,
now I can finally use it.

1095
01:36:13,512 --> 01:36:14,965
What is inside?

1096
01:36:15,045 --> 01:36:19,306
Ever since I grew up,
I've been watching videos at night.

1097
01:36:19,386 --> 01:36:21,266
Girls dress up beautifully
in those videos.

1098
01:36:21,536 --> 01:36:24,729
I wanted to see you in those clothes.

1099
01:36:43,455 --> 01:36:49,604
"You made my heart pine
for you with your longing looks."

1100
01:36:49,992 --> 01:36:53,016
"You evoked many desires in me and.."

1101
01:36:53,096 --> 01:36:55,854
"quenched my longing
with your embraces."

1102
01:36:56,090 --> 01:37:02,509
"Your beauty now belongs to me."

1103
01:37:02,881 --> 01:37:08,742
"It is calling to me
putting my body on fire."

1104
01:37:08,822 --> 01:37:14,763
"My body is full of desire for you."

1105
01:37:14,843 --> 01:37:21,520
"It is eagerly waiting for you."

1106
01:38:26,810 --> 01:38:27,976
How long should we wait?

1107
01:38:28,056 --> 01:38:30,594
We got all our information just today.

1108
01:38:30,831 --> 01:38:32,317
Let them live one more day.

1109
01:38:32,739 --> 01:38:34,243
The day after tomorrow is a Sunday.

1110
01:38:34,323 --> 01:38:36,540
It will be the last day of their lives.

1111
01:38:36,811 --> 01:38:40,916
That night everyone will
eat to their full and go to sleep.

1112
01:38:41,186 --> 01:38:46,102
We'll slit everyone's
throats before they realize it.

1113
01:38:46,321 --> 01:38:48,788
What is your name?
- Yenkaiah, sir.

1114
01:38:48,868 --> 01:38:50,325
How long have you been here?

1115
01:38:50,405 --> 01:38:52,166
We were born and raised here.
- Okay, go.

1116
01:38:55,183 --> 01:38:57,413
Ramakrishna,
you are the only one I see all the time.

1117
01:38:57,493 --> 01:38:58,781
Where is your SI?

1118
01:38:58,861 --> 01:39:00,267
Our SI is on leave, sir.

1119
01:39:00,347 --> 01:39:01,213
What for?

1120
01:39:01,293 --> 01:39:03,257
His wife divorced him, that's why.

1121
01:39:03,528 --> 01:39:05,639
Oh, the most happiest man, right?

1122
01:39:05,719 --> 01:39:09,338
I'm losing hope that
we'll ever find them, sir.

1123
01:39:09,758 --> 01:39:14,217
Ramakrishna, you have less
faith because your salary is less.

1124
01:39:14,504 --> 01:39:18,542
I have more faith because
my salary is more.

1125
01:39:19,048 --> 01:39:21,700
They committed a crime,
they will definitely get caught.

1126
01:39:21,954 --> 01:39:23,778
I have no time to chat with you.

1127
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:26,053
We have many villages to visit.
Let's go.

1128
01:39:26,133 --> 01:39:27,151
Okay, sir.

1129
01:39:34,904 --> 01:39:38,924
What a surprise!
Please come. Come inside.

1130
01:39:39,566 --> 01:39:41,205
Mother! Father!

1131
01:39:41,774 --> 01:39:44,578
Please come. Have a seat.

1132
01:39:44,882 --> 01:39:45,761
Mother!

1133
01:39:45,841 --> 01:39:47,416
Please come. Sit down.

1134
01:39:47,496 --> 01:39:49,595
Father! Please sit.

1135
01:39:49,916 --> 01:39:51,876
Hello! Hello!

1136
01:39:51,956 --> 01:39:53,886
Hello!
- Sit here, father.

1137
01:39:55,423 --> 01:39:57,162
What's wrong, Sambaiah?
- How are you, dear?

1138
01:39:57,242 --> 01:39:59,216
It's been a long time since
we came to see your girl..

1139
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:01,064
..but you never replied back.

1140
01:40:01,588 --> 01:40:03,817
I tried showing other girls to my son.

1141
01:40:03,897 --> 01:40:05,794
But he's not interested in any of them.

1142
01:40:08,361 --> 01:40:10,473
He's not sleeping well too.

1143
01:40:10,788 --> 01:40:13,473
I couldn't see that as a father..

1144
01:40:13,744 --> 01:40:15,365
..that's why I brought him to you.

1145
01:40:15,445 --> 01:40:17,663
We liked your son very much,
but since you demanded..

1146
01:40:17,743 --> 01:40:19,571
..for a huge dowry..

1147
01:40:19,651 --> 01:40:22,629
That was the case
when my son was arrogant.

1148
01:40:22,848 --> 01:40:24,639
Your son knocked it down.

1149
01:40:26,678 --> 01:40:31,340
We can't sell our
son in the name of dowry.

1150
01:40:31,914 --> 01:40:35,479
I'll bear all the expenses
for the wedding. Just say yes.

1151
01:40:36,644 --> 01:40:39,854
Alright. I'll find a good
day and bring the priest..

1152
01:40:40,110 --> 01:40:42,458
..to your house so that
we can fix a wedding date.

1153
01:40:42,538 --> 01:40:45,752
We are happy that you said yes.
Thank you.

1154
01:40:45,989 --> 01:40:47,492
Let's go, son.

1155
01:40:48,877 --> 01:40:50,076
Just a minute.

1156
01:40:50,414 --> 01:40:51,968
He's a part of our family now.

1157
01:40:52,205 --> 01:40:54,806
You go home.
I'll show him around the village..

1158
01:40:55,110 --> 01:40:57,526
..arrange a grand dinner
for him and send him tomorrow.

1159
01:40:57,606 --> 01:40:59,381
Young men these days..

1160
01:40:59,461 --> 01:41:01,543
I'll stay, dad. You go home.
- Okay, take care.

1161
01:41:01,780 --> 01:41:03,114
See you later.
- See you later.

1162
01:41:06,644 --> 01:41:09,432
Come on,
we'll go to drink toddy tonight.

1163
01:41:09,512 --> 01:41:11,430
It will blow your mind.
- Really? Is it that good?

1164
01:41:11,454 --> 01:41:19,123
"When you sip toddy,
it goes straight to your heart."

1165
01:41:19,832 --> 01:41:24,967
"Toddy makes the earth go round."

1166
01:41:25,557 --> 01:41:31,435
"I swear that I'll create a riot today."

1167
01:41:55,968 --> 01:41:58,757
"When you lift your lungi
and fold your shirt sleeves.."

1168
01:41:58,837 --> 01:42:01,612
"you are the undisputable king."

1169
01:42:04,585 --> 01:42:07,287
"When you raise the bottle,
you raise your head.."

1170
01:42:07,367 --> 01:42:10,395
"wrong becomes right."

1171
01:42:13,014 --> 01:42:18,516
"When you drink you'll see stars."

1172
01:42:18,596 --> 01:42:21,338
"We laugh, we love.."

1173
01:42:21,418 --> 01:42:23,998
"you and me, we are human after all."

1174
01:42:24,078 --> 01:42:26,669
"We live, we drink.."

1175
01:42:26,749 --> 01:42:30,054
"what's the use of
this life if we don't drink?"

1176
01:42:30,134 --> 01:42:32,695
"Every man who drinks
is the king of the world."

1177
01:42:32,775 --> 01:42:35,484
"Let's forget ourselves and dance."

1178
01:42:38,619 --> 01:42:41,354
"The liquor store is like
the in-laws' house for us."

1179
01:42:41,434 --> 01:42:44,182
"Let's plough the world."

1180
01:43:12,534 --> 01:43:15,226
"Here's your drink and
here's fish fry to go with it."

1181
01:43:15,306 --> 01:43:18,113
"Enjoy yourself, my friend."

1182
01:43:20,988 --> 01:43:26,266
"Don't listen to your mother
and tie yourself with a girl."

1183
01:43:29,434 --> 01:43:34,493
"Once you raise your glass,
you'll see many wonders."

1184
01:43:34,790 --> 01:43:40,271
"If you fall for a girl,
your life will be ruined."

1185
01:43:40,466 --> 01:43:46,227
"After having a peg you
can break down the mountains."

1186
01:43:51,795 --> 01:43:57,409
"God sent the heaven down for us."

1187
01:44:00,479 --> 01:44:05,744
"Don't push yourself into
hell by falling for women."

1188
01:44:31,602 --> 01:44:32,791
What are you doing here?

1189
01:44:33,667 --> 01:44:34,667
Disgusting!

1190
01:44:35,191 --> 01:44:36,191
Parvati!

1191
01:44:39,257 --> 01:44:40,036
Parvati!

1192
01:44:40,116 --> 01:44:41,322
You will never change.

1193
01:44:41,402 --> 01:44:43,949
Wait a minute. I will never drink again.

1194
01:44:44,241 --> 01:44:47,787
I beg of you.
I'll fall at your feet. Parvati..

1195
01:44:48,623 --> 01:44:49,650
Wait a minute.

1196
01:44:55,348 --> 01:44:56,537
Parvati!

1197
01:45:04,494 --> 01:45:07,867
Parvati! Open the door!

1198
01:45:08,917 --> 01:45:10,798
Oh, it's open.

1199
01:45:14,765 --> 01:45:17,630
Why is she crying so much?

1200
01:45:24,131 --> 01:45:25,720
Will you please stop crying?

1201
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:30,650
Why are you crying as
if I committed a great sin?

1202
01:45:30,730 --> 01:45:32,475
You deceived me. Isn't that enough?

1203
01:45:32,555 --> 01:45:34,464
Drinking and smoking is not deceiving..

1204
01:45:34,670 --> 01:45:36,710
..seeing another girl
behind your back is deceiving.

1205
01:45:37,146 --> 01:45:41,178
Who says you won't do that next?

1206
01:45:41,258 --> 01:45:43,531
I'll break your jaw if you talk rubbish.

1207
01:45:43,611 --> 01:45:46,364
Don't imagine the
worst and fight with me.

1208
01:45:46,444 --> 01:45:51,229
I'm losing hope that you will marry me.

1209
01:45:51,951 --> 01:45:53,821
Maybe you'll use and discard me.

1210
01:45:53,901 --> 01:45:58,708
Don't say such things.
I beg of you. I'm crazy about you.

1211
01:45:59,367 --> 01:46:02,830
You drank after taking
oath on my name that you won't.

1212
01:46:03,057 --> 01:46:04,646
So you don't care if I live or die.

1213
01:46:04,726 --> 01:46:06,927
If people die when someone
takes an oath on them..

1214
01:46:07,007 --> 01:46:08,767
..our country wouldn't
be so populated today.

1215
01:46:09,089 --> 01:46:14,226
An oath is a sign of trust.
If there is no trust, there is no life.

1216
01:46:14,561 --> 01:46:17,739
Oh God! What do you want now?

1217
01:46:18,377 --> 01:46:20,107
You want to get married, is that it?

1218
01:46:20,571 --> 01:46:22,161
We'll get married tomorrow morning.

1219
01:46:23,124 --> 01:46:25,481
Don't you trust me? Don't you trust me?

1220
01:46:26,681 --> 01:46:29,121
Alright, I'll tell you in another way.
Will you trust me then?

1221
01:46:35,715 --> 01:46:37,477
We'll get married
tomorrow morning. Okay?

1222
01:46:39,618 --> 01:46:41,650
Don't cry so much
for every little thing.

1223
01:46:46,744 --> 01:46:47,999
Wait a minute, Koti.

1224
01:46:48,907 --> 01:46:49,907
What?

1225
01:46:50,085 --> 01:46:51,328
I can't come inside.

1226
01:46:51,408 --> 01:46:52,408
Why?

1227
01:46:52,463 --> 01:46:53,750
Please understand.

1228
01:46:55,113 --> 01:46:56,194
Oh, that.

1229
01:46:56,274 --> 01:46:58,302
Alright. The God everybody
worships is there..

1230
01:46:58,519 --> 01:47:00,032
..and the God you worship is here.

1231
01:47:00,112 --> 01:47:02,672
It doesn't matter where I tie
the wedding chain. I'll do it here.

1232
01:47:04,874 --> 01:47:05,874
Come on.

1233
01:47:28,221 --> 01:47:29,237
This is a temple.

1234
01:47:31,572 --> 01:47:32,675
Okay, let's go.

1235
01:47:37,872 --> 01:47:43,970
Come, this is our house.
They will love you.

1236
01:47:44,380 --> 01:47:45,494
Don't be scared.

1237
01:47:46,746 --> 01:47:48,930
Father! Father!

1238
01:47:49,740 --> 01:47:51,049
What are you doing this morning?

1239
01:47:51,351 --> 01:47:52,586
Are you drinking already? Come out.

1240
01:47:52,610 --> 01:47:53,946
What's going on?

1241
01:47:55,286 --> 01:47:57,168
Father, she is my wife.

1242
01:47:58,909 --> 01:48:01,201
If I had told you before,
you would've talked about..

1243
01:48:01,281 --> 01:48:03,161
..auspicious dates,
traditions, dowry and so on.

1244
01:48:03,947 --> 01:48:05,774
That's why I married
her and brought her home.

1245
01:48:07,277 --> 01:48:08,906
As my wife she'll take good care of me..

1246
01:48:08,986 --> 01:48:11,566
..and as a daughter in
law she'll love our family.

1247
01:48:11,646 --> 01:48:13,987
I'm very fortunate that I got her.

1248
01:48:15,252 --> 01:48:16,779
Wait a minute.
Where is it?

1249
01:48:18,156 --> 01:48:19,474
Father! Father! Don't beat me!

1250
01:48:19,554 --> 01:48:22,698
You finished all the alcohol
last night and left me none.

1251
01:48:22,778 --> 01:48:23,943
Father! Why are you hitting me?

1252
01:48:23,967 --> 01:48:25,132
Now you stole a garland
from the graveyard and..

1253
01:48:25,156 --> 01:48:26,224
..came here to fool
me that you got married.

1254
01:48:26,248 --> 01:48:27,909
Why are you beating your son?

1255
01:48:28,741 --> 01:48:31,811
He claims he married some girl.

1256
01:48:31,891 --> 01:48:34,851
Only he can see her,
I don't see anybody here.

1257
01:48:35,219 --> 01:48:36,799
What are you talking about?
Are you drunk?

1258
01:48:36,823 --> 01:48:37,823
She is right there.

1259
01:48:41,338 --> 01:48:42,808
Where is she? Go see for yourself.

1260
01:48:44,913 --> 01:48:46,546
Don't you see anyone here?

1261
01:48:46,626 --> 01:48:48,178
I don't see anybody. Even last night..

1262
01:48:48,258 --> 01:48:49,531
..you ran away acting
as if you saw someone.

1263
01:48:49,555 --> 01:48:50,708
What happened to you?

1264
01:48:51,281 --> 01:48:54,069
No, she was here. I brought her with me.

1265
01:48:54,149 --> 01:48:54,814
There's nobody here.

1266
01:48:54,894 --> 01:48:57,950
My father is a drunkard,
but I didn't expect this of you.

1267
01:48:58,641 --> 01:48:59,641
Where did she go?

1268
01:48:59,831 --> 01:49:00,879
Wait.

1269
01:49:01,917 --> 01:49:03,096
Parvati!

1270
01:49:05,434 --> 01:49:06,731
Parvati, where are you?

1271
01:49:11,639 --> 01:49:12,645
Parvati!

1272
01:49:14,532 --> 01:49:15,646
Manamma!

1273
01:49:16,121 --> 01:49:17,321
What's wrong?

1274
01:49:17,401 --> 01:49:18,543
Parvati is missing.

1275
01:49:18,623 --> 01:49:19,981
Who is Parvati?

1276
01:49:20,061 --> 01:49:21,881
I've been going around with
her for 3 months. Didn't you see her?

1277
01:49:21,905 --> 01:49:23,945
Do you know how you have
been for the past 3 months?

1278
01:49:54,315 --> 01:49:55,374
What's going on?

1279
01:49:57,099 --> 01:49:59,640
I was scared that you'll beat me up,
so I didn't ask.

1280
01:50:00,018 --> 01:50:01,997
I think you are possessed by a demon.

1281
01:50:02,202 --> 01:50:03,555
What rubbish are you talking about?

1282
01:50:03,579 --> 01:50:05,737
Say yes if you've seen her,
otherwise say no.

1283
01:50:07,768 --> 01:50:08,925
Parvati!

1284
01:50:15,573 --> 01:50:17,022
Why is the house like this?

1285
01:50:19,517 --> 01:50:20,577
Parvati!

1286
01:50:25,852 --> 01:50:26,966
Where did she go?

1287
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:34,806
What is all this?

1288
01:51:06,970 --> 01:51:07,970
Parvati!

1289
01:51:22,013 --> 01:51:24,002
He claims he married some girl.

1290
01:51:24,082 --> 01:51:27,246
Only he can see her,
I don't see anybody here.

1291
01:51:32,722 --> 01:51:34,300
I don't see anybody. Even last night..

1292
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:35,892
..you ran away acting
as if you saw someone.

1293
01:51:35,916 --> 01:51:36,949
What happened to you?

1294
01:51:44,623 --> 01:51:46,375
I think you are possessed by a demon.

1295
01:52:29,609 --> 01:52:31,642
I slept with a ghost all these months?

1296
01:52:31,999 --> 01:52:33,826
What an idiot I am!

1297
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:45,240
What is this?
Why did it stop all of a sudden?

1298
01:52:48,766 --> 01:52:49,766
What's wrong?

1299
01:52:54,431 --> 01:52:56,395
Oh God! She's here. God..

1300
01:53:07,921 --> 01:53:11,078
If you fear me,
I'll look like a demon to you.

1301
01:53:11,294 --> 01:53:15,099
See me as the girl you love,
then I'll look like her.

1302
01:53:15,179 --> 01:53:21,244
Okay, okay. Appear normal, please.

1303
01:53:21,914 --> 01:53:23,460
My heart is breaking here.

1304
01:53:51,406 --> 01:53:52,466
Where is she?

1305
01:54:21,810 --> 01:54:25,702
I don't understand.
Who are you? Why did you pick me?

1306
01:54:26,081 --> 01:54:27,778
Why nobody else can see you?

1307
01:54:27,858 --> 01:54:29,497
Please make me understand.

1308
01:54:40,845 --> 01:54:42,013
Father, coffee.

1309
01:54:44,618 --> 01:54:46,186
Parvati, come here.

1310
01:54:48,802 --> 01:54:50,024
Look at this photo.

1311
01:54:54,967 --> 01:54:56,524
Do you like him?

1312
01:54:57,962 --> 01:54:58,962
Hmm.

1313
01:55:00,751 --> 01:55:03,303
Alright, I'll go to
their village tomorrow.

1314
01:55:03,383 --> 01:55:07,041
If I like everything I see,
I'll ask them to come and see you.

1315
01:55:07,121 --> 01:55:08,230
Okay?

1316
01:55:08,511 --> 01:55:09,701
Okay, father.

1317
01:56:45,561 --> 01:56:47,637
Who are you? What are you doing here?

1318
01:57:48,531 --> 01:57:49,958
Is there nothing inside?

1319
01:57:51,331 --> 01:57:52,066
What do we do now?

1320
01:57:52,146 --> 01:57:53,666
Hang on. We'll look inside.

1321
01:57:58,239 --> 01:57:58,823
Be careful.

1322
01:57:58,903 --> 01:58:00,152
Hey! Who are you?

1323
01:58:07,715 --> 01:58:08,715
Father!

1324
01:58:15,001 --> 01:58:16,060
Father!

1325
01:58:21,012 --> 01:58:22,925
Father!

1326
01:58:32,983 --> 01:58:36,875
They have no gold on their
bodies or in their house.

1327
01:58:37,653 --> 01:58:39,493
If they have gold we
kill them for their gold..

1328
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:43,221
..otherwise we kill them
for not having anything. Let's go.

1329
01:59:11,823 --> 01:59:14,450
Now those 15 men are in this village.

1330
01:59:16,191 --> 01:59:19,052
They plan to kill everyone
in this village tonight.

1331
01:59:24,468 --> 01:59:26,165
It's not because they
killed your village..

1332
01:59:26,489 --> 01:59:28,809
..or that they are going
to kill the people of my village..

1333
01:59:33,105 --> 01:59:35,991
..but they killed you,
the girl I loved..

1334
01:59:36,294 --> 01:59:38,067
..and for that I'll
kill all those rascals.

1335
01:59:39,041 --> 01:59:40,576
I didn't see how they killed you.

1336
01:59:41,160 --> 01:59:44,695
But you'll see how I'm
going to slay them. Come on.

1337
02:02:52,768 --> 02:02:53,768
Let me go!

1338
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:53,520
Where are they?

1339
02:03:58,780 --> 02:04:00,001
Why don't I see anyone?

1340
02:04:11,144 --> 02:04:13,987
What's wrong? Where are our men? Hey!

1341
02:05:52,213 --> 02:05:53,575
Did you make the call?

1342
02:05:55,662 --> 02:05:58,485
Yes, and I'm the
one who killed them too.

1343
02:05:59,890 --> 02:06:01,209
Why did you kill them?

1344
02:06:01,869 --> 02:06:04,907
They are the gang of thieves
that you've been searching.

1345
02:06:05,425 --> 02:06:07,231
That's why I killed them.

1346
02:06:07,422 --> 02:06:10,849
Why did you kill them instead
of informing the police?

1347
02:06:11,044 --> 02:06:12,190
Arrest him.

1348
02:06:13,962 --> 02:06:17,844
Nobody understands a good deed.

1349
02:06:20,253 --> 02:06:21,639
After you told me what they did to you..

1350
02:06:21,663 --> 02:06:24,772
..I was so angry that
I killed all of them.

1351
02:06:25,032 --> 02:06:27,951
We did a good deed
but they don't understand.

1352
02:06:28,441 --> 02:06:29,252
Let's see what happens

1353
02:06:29,332 --> 02:06:31,492
Has he lost it?
- What do you say? What else can we do?

1354
02:06:38,815 --> 02:06:42,945
Finally, you came.
I was so worried that you won't come.

1355
02:06:44,080 --> 02:06:46,858
Don't worry about anything.
I'll handle everything.

1356
02:06:46,938 --> 02:06:48,588
Who is he talking to?

1357
02:06:48,828 --> 02:06:50,698
I'll make sure that we get out of here.

1358
02:06:52,136 --> 02:06:54,376
What are you looking at?
I'm not talking to you. Go away.

1359
02:06:55,812 --> 02:06:58,179
Every idiot is curious.
I'll take care of it.

1360
02:06:58,259 --> 02:06:59,444
Sir!

1361
02:06:59,671 --> 02:07:00,671
Yes?

1362
02:07:00,872 --> 02:07:04,980
He's weird. He's talking
to someone that we can't see.

1363
02:07:05,358 --> 02:07:08,450
He's none of our business.
Take him to the court.

1364
02:07:08,666 --> 02:07:09,682
Okay, sir.

1365
02:07:23,190 --> 02:07:28,044
Your Honor!
The accused, Koti, from Chintalapudi..

1366
02:07:28,217 --> 02:07:32,218
..brutally killed 15 men last night.

1367
02:07:32,467 --> 02:07:33,104
So, the accused..

1368
02:07:33,184 --> 02:07:35,558
Sir, can you please stop it?

1369
02:07:36,099 --> 02:07:39,829
The accused, Koti..
Brutally.. What kind of language is it?

1370
02:07:40,131 --> 02:07:41,969
We village people talk better than that.

1371
02:07:42,676 --> 02:07:46,157
And there is no one
here to defend my case.

1372
02:07:46,395 --> 02:07:51,865
So, I'll present my case to him.
Please take your seat.

1373
02:07:52,167 --> 02:07:54,221
Hmm. Tell me.

1374
02:07:54,632 --> 02:07:57,973
Sir, the 15 men that I killed..

1375
02:07:58,200 --> 02:08:01,367
..murdered 72 people
in a village named Pullur.

1376
02:08:03,065 --> 02:08:04,969
They threw little kids against the wall.

1377
02:08:06,774 --> 02:08:09,315
They stripped the
girls and stabbed them.

1378
02:08:10,147 --> 02:08:14,550
That's why I brutally
killed them as he said.

1379
02:08:14,961 --> 02:08:17,609
Okay, how do you know
that the men you killed..

1380
02:08:17,689 --> 02:08:19,155
..were those 15 thieves?

1381
02:08:19,411 --> 02:08:22,795
I have a person to
testify that it was them..

1382
02:08:23,065 --> 02:08:26,081
..but nobody can see her or hear her.

1383
02:08:26,751 --> 02:08:30,167
How can I prove it to you? How?

1384
02:08:34,783 --> 02:08:37,486
Sir, I'm sure you have
the post mortem reports..

1385
02:08:37,566 --> 02:08:39,014
..of those 72 people.

1386
02:08:39,094 --> 02:08:40,938
I'll tell you how each
one of them was killed..

1387
02:08:41,111 --> 02:08:43,933
..you can compare it with the reports.

1388
02:08:46,052 --> 02:08:47,814
Why are you sitting there? Come here.

1389
02:09:00,411 --> 02:09:01,503
Come here.

1390
02:09:08,584 --> 02:09:11,301
Tell me how they killed you. Tell me.

1391
02:09:11,549 --> 02:09:14,133
They stabbed and slit my throat.

1392
02:09:14,213 --> 02:09:15,213
Sir!

1393
02:09:17,214 --> 02:09:19,441
See the report of a girl named Parvati.

1394
02:09:19,700 --> 02:09:21,981
They stabbed and slit her throat.

1395
02:09:22,186 --> 02:09:23,970
Check if it's true.

1396
02:09:31,176 --> 02:09:32,441
How did they kill your father?

1397
02:09:32,754 --> 02:09:34,246
How did they kill him?

1398
02:09:34,549 --> 02:09:36,127
They clamped my father's mouth..

1399
02:09:36,311 --> 02:09:38,311
..and stabbed multiple
times in the stomach.

1400
02:09:38,391 --> 02:09:39,273
Sir!

1401
02:09:39,353 --> 02:09:40,463
What is your father's name?

1402
02:09:40,895 --> 02:09:41,895
Srinivasa Rao.

1403
02:09:42,524 --> 02:09:45,248
Sir, check the report
of the man named Srinivasa Rao.

1404
02:09:45,615 --> 02:09:48,480
They clamped his mouth shut
and stabbed him multiple times.

1405
02:10:42,265 --> 02:10:49,238
I've never seen or heard
such a strange case in my life.

1406
02:10:54,265 --> 02:10:57,960
So, I don't know what verdict to give.

1407
02:11:01,517 --> 02:11:02,912
I know it, sir.

1408
02:11:03,290 --> 02:11:07,103
You might think that
I'm one of those thieves.

1409
02:11:07,330 --> 02:11:12,595
But the thing is, if I could
end the story with those 15 men..

1410
02:11:12,675 --> 02:11:15,049
..I could've got them
arrested the same day, sir.

1411
02:11:15,421 --> 02:11:19,269
But there is a greater
thief than those men.

1412
02:11:19,518 --> 02:11:22,696
I came here to prove that to all of you.

1413
02:11:45,870 --> 02:11:47,773
Sir, even though we live in a village..

1414
02:11:47,853 --> 02:11:50,463
..we use phones when they are needed.

1415
02:11:50,668 --> 02:11:52,560
All the proof you'll need is in this.

1416
02:12:21,276 --> 02:12:22,830
It is a crime to kill a police officer..

1417
02:12:22,854 --> 02:12:24,563
..in the court before a judge.

1418
02:12:24,643 --> 02:12:28,649
But since it was done to
kill a man who did bigger crimes..

1419
02:12:28,828 --> 02:12:31,682
..the court doesn't
consider it a great crime..

1420
02:12:32,038 --> 02:12:34,514
..and sentences him
to prison for seven years.

1421
02:12:49,753 --> 02:12:52,196
Thank God you are here.

1422
02:12:53,493 --> 02:12:55,517
Why didn't you come to
meet me in these seven years?

1423
02:12:55,541 --> 02:12:58,174
I thought you went back
since your job is done.

1424
02:13:01,061 --> 02:13:05,331
How can I leave without you?
I have to take you with me.

1425
02:13:05,821 --> 02:13:07,583
Should I take you?

1426
02:13:07,983 --> 02:13:10,480
No. You don't go and
don't take me with you.

1427
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:13,583
We'll stay right here.
Come here. Come on.

1428
02:13:14,610 --> 02:13:15,864
Is the cot strong enough?

1429
02:13:17,941 --> 02:13:20,341
Can't you think of anything else?
- What else is there to do?

1430
02:13:20,892 --> 02:13:25,061
Take some more rice and curry. Eat well.

1431
02:13:27,082 --> 02:13:29,268
Father, how many times
did I tell you to serve her food?

1432
02:13:29,292 --> 02:13:30,725
Serve food? For whom?

1433
02:13:30,805 --> 02:13:33,180
For her. Serve her food.

1434
02:13:33,352 --> 02:13:35,309
I swear. I can't see anyone.

1435
02:13:35,389 --> 02:13:36,827
But I can see her.

1436
02:13:37,508 --> 02:13:38,508
That's right.

1437
02:13:39,400 --> 02:13:41,454
Eat. My father cooks well.

1438
02:13:41,534 --> 02:13:44,654
Do you want rice?
I'll serve some curry too.

1439
02:13:44,903 --> 02:13:45,903
Do it, father.

1440
02:13:46,120 --> 02:13:48,477
He's possessed by a female demon.

1441
02:13:48,557 --> 02:13:51,612
Come on, eat. It's very good.

1442
02:13:52,942 --> 02:13:54,222
But I can't see anyone.
- Father!

1443
02:13:54,769 --> 02:13:57,632
Okay, son. You both enjoy your food.

1444
02:13:57,837 --> 02:14:00,745
Daughter in law is very fair like me.

1445
02:14:01,945 --> 02:14:04,810
Eat. Mix it well.
Do you want me to feed you?

1446
02:14:05,080 --> 02:14:09,387
Suvarna is busy with prayers,
so I have to do all the work.

1447
02:14:13,527 --> 02:14:18,468
What is that noise? Who is inside?

1448
02:14:34,698 --> 02:14:37,033
Parvati! Why are you so beautiful?

1449
02:14:45,569 --> 02:14:48,098
He's having marital relations
with an invisible girl. Oh God!

1450
02:14:54,646 --> 02:14:58,192
I heard that only you can see your wife.

1451
02:14:58,419 --> 02:15:00,548
Can you ask her to appear to us too?

1452
02:15:00,628 --> 02:15:03,402
Why not? She's right beside me.
Look at her.

1453
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:11,549
Oh God, my lungi!

1454
02:15:11,732 --> 02:15:13,257
Never mind, life is important.

1455
02:15:15,484 --> 02:15:18,446
This is how my life will
be if you are beside me.

1456
02:15:18,641 --> 02:15:21,073
You and me, just the two of us.
Let's go.

1457
02:15:25,571 --> 02:15:28,182
There's no chance of
us having children, right?

1458
02:15:28,262 --> 02:15:29,198
How is that possible?

1459
02:15:29,278 --> 02:15:32,117
Darn! I love children.

1460
02:15:32,197 --> 02:15:33,652
Then let's adopt a child.

1461
02:15:33,732 --> 02:15:35,782
How can he live with
an invisible mother..

1462
02:15:35,862 --> 02:15:37,079
..and a visible father?

1463
02:15:37,159 --> 02:15:41,047
You are more fortunate
than all other men, you know.

1464
02:15:41,127 --> 02:15:42,247
Really?

1465
02:15:42,327 --> 02:15:46,193
Even when you become 50 years old,
I'll still be beautiful.

1466
02:15:46,273 --> 02:15:49,230
Even when you are 70 years old,
I'll still be the same.

1467
02:15:49,846 --> 02:15:52,225
Can anyone else be as lucky as you?

1468
02:15:52,614 --> 02:15:57,987
Yeah, that's right.
Come, let's go home and make love.

1469
02:15:58,155 --> 02:16:01,420
The thing is,
I make love to a demon by choice..

1470
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:05,344
..but the others unknowingly
make love to devils.
