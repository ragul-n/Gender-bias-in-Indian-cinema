1
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,312
<i>There is a sacred place
in the deep swamp...</i>

2
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:24,815
<i>where the mangrove trees
grow close together...</i>

3
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,649
<i>and the rays of the sun
are never seen.</i>

4
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:32,684
<i>My people call this place
The Dark Water.</i>

5
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:36,726
<i>The spirit of the swamp lives.</i>

6
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:45,798
<i>This place was always filled
with life and beauty...</i>

7
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,135
<i>but evil men have changed that...</i>

8
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,069
<i>with their drills...</i>

9
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:52,901
<i>their pipes...</i>

10
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:54,677
<i>greed...</i>

11
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,347
<i>and murder.</i>

12
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,120
<i>Now the swamp cries out
a warning.</i>

13
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:15,096
<i>A time of retribution is here.</i>

14
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,395
- Wait!
- Hey!

15
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:57,805
Wait!

16
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,402
Come on.

17
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,878
Not here, Billy.

18
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,326
Wait!

19
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:20,831
Sarah!

20
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,757
Stop!

21
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,933
- I mean it, Sarah, stop!
- Come on, Billy.

22
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,863
I don't want to.

23
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,275
Come on back to the fire.
This swamp's dangerous.

24
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,945
You're out of your goddamn mind.

25
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,792
You've heard the stories
about this place.

26
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:59,097
Hey, people disappear down here
all the time, girl.

27
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,138
Why you being so crazy?

28
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:05,141
- Afraid of the dark, Billy-boy?
- No...

29
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,706
- but this place has bad Mojo.
- 'Fraidy-cat.

30
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,972
Oh shit!

31
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,197
- You still afraid, Billy-boy?
- We shouldn't be out here.

32
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,462
Holy shit.

33
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,568
You seem like a virgin, Billy.

34
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,978
I ain't no fucking virgin.

35
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,042
- Oh my God!
- You liked that, baby?

36
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,277
That's good.

37
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,317
Oh my God!

38
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,792
So... you're taking me
the scenic route, huh?

39
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:12,162
What're you doing here, boy?

40
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,370
Start a new life.

41
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,504
Looking for peace and quiet
you know?

42
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,276
You city boys sure are funny.

43
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,650
Why do they call it
Bywater?

44
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,852
Because it's by the water.

45
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,318
No ma'am, I can't.

46
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,896
I'm sorry,
but I have to stay put.

47
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,827
I don't know where your son is.

48
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,697
- I got to get out of this town.
- Why would you leave Paradise?

49
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,776
- You scared the shit out of me.
- Sorry.

50
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,079
I'm Kyle Williams,
the new sheriff.

51
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,445
- You must be Eric Fraser.
- Yeah, Fraser'll do.

52
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,249
- What?
- No offence, but...

53
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,589
well, I just expected someone
more...

54
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,827
more experienced.

55
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,919
- I mean, considering...
- Considering what?

56
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,070
See Sheriff Corely, he...
well...

57
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,845
he kind of went insane
before he disappeared.

58
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,724
Lots of missing persons
for a small town.

59
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,954
I guess they didn't fill you in
all the way.

60
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,766
This Indian medicine man,
Ted Sallis...

61
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,127
was the first one to disappear.

62
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:27,363
Corely thought
Sallis put a curse on Bywater.

63
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,107
- I can take all this down.
- No.

64
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,674
Leave it.

65
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,184
- So, what do you think?
- I don't know.

66
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:43,711
'Gator attacks.
Murder, possibly.

67
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:48,193
Another disappeared last night.
Local boy.

68
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,554
- Billy James.
- Jesus.

69
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,332
- Who's Rene Laroque?
- A local troublemaker.

70
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,304
Corely thought he was
involved with Sallis.

71
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,704
Called him a shape shifter.

72
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,909
- But we could never catch him.
- Why can't you?

73
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,112
Why can't we catch him?

74
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,313
Hell, you ain't been
in that swamp before? Well...

75
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,851
Deputy Fraser.

76
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,424
Oh hey Val.
It's the coroner.

77
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,255
Wh-what?

78
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,632
Oh my God!

79
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,105
Is that Billy?

80
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,435
Yeah.

81
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,337
That's Billy.

82
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,379
Fraser, you go wait outside.

83
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,582
Yeah, okay.

84
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,025
Cause of death?

85
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,628
Only thing large enough...

86
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,888
around here is a gator.

87
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,392
The girl who was with him
might have seen what happened.

88
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,229
She's down at the hospital.

89
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,306
Is this normal?

90
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,408
This green stuff?

91
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,803
Sheriff, this body has been in
the swamp. You understand?

92
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,243
Yeah. For one night.

93
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:26,086
Mr. Schist called,
a disturbance at the oil site.

94
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,486
You go.
I'll stick with this.

95
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,595
He wants you to handle it.

96
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:35,060
Said he wants you to see
what he's up against.

97
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,168
Okay.

98
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,367
I want a full autopsy.

99
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:45,976
You got it.

100
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,416
I appreciate your right
to free assembly...

101
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,046
but this here
is private property.

102
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:01,185
Now, we can cut you out
one by one...

103
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:05,152
or you can tell me
where the key is to that chain.

104
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:09,033
This is not a goddamn park
this is a worksite.

105
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,693
Surely, you've got a home
to go to.

106
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,569
I've been real patient with you.

107
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,311
- You're all trespassing.
- You listen to the man!

108
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,715
I'm giving you one last chance...

109
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,644
to disperse!

110
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:29,251
Or I'll drag you out
by that chain!

111
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,823
Fraser, I'm real glad
you're here.

112
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,060
- I want all these folk arrested.
- Now, now.

113
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,060
This is Kyle Williams,
our new Sheriff.

114
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,698
- Sheriff, this is Jake Schist.
- Morning.

115
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,234
He's foreman,
heading up...

116
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:46,929
the new drilling.

117
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,731
Good, you can arrest them.

118
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,940
Arresting them all is difficult.

119
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,340
I'll see what I can do.

120
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,305
All right everyone...

121
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,083
I appreciate your right
to free assembly...

122
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,917
but this is a privately
owned site.

123
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,690
Your actions here are illegal.

124
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,826
Get your asses off the mud
and go home.

125
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,690
Who the hell are you?

126
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,826
The new Sheriff.

127
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,958
Well, have a taste
of country hospitality, Sheriff.

128
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,767
Our asses aren't moving.

129
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,929
Go fuck a tree,
you hippie bitch.

130
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,639
Here.

131
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,240
- Fraser!
- Got it, Chief.

132
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,076
Ma'am, right or wrong
it's my job.

133
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,718
It's about a different law.

134
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,353
Schist has committed
a crime here...

135
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,355
for long enough.

136
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:41,857
You've got handcuffs,
put them on Schist.

137
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:46,863
Bolt cutters.

138
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,328
Hey, what are you doing?

139
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,940
Sheriff, I'm sorry.

140
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,045
Are you all right?

141
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,340
- Walk or ride?
- What did you say?

142
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,943
Put me down! This is a violation
of my civil rights.

143
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,983
You have the right
to remain silent.

144
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:13,523
Anything you say...

145
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,257
- Who do you think you are?
- Fraser! Cut them loose.

146
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,123
I want an attorney.

147
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,028
- You have a right to an attorney.
- I want a lawyer.

148
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,360
If you can't afford an attorney,
one will be appointed to you.

149
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,261
Get in the car.

150
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:29,338
You'd better be arresting me.
I'll kick your city-boy...

151
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,839
Got in straight to work,
Sheriff.

152
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,745
I like that.

153
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,281
Howdy Sheriff.
Frederic Schist.

154
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,648
Kyle Williams.

155
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,583
Hell of a way
to spend your first day.

156
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,726
I hate this, these
are good folk.

157
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,793
I sympathize.

158
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,056
Can't let the goddamn flies
spoil the picnic, Sheriff.

159
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,926
You'll hear a lot about me.

160
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,303
I'm the big fish in the
small pond.

161
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,433
Bottom line...

162
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,700
I'm breaking no law.

163
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,173
No American law anyways.
And I paid a bundle for this land.

164
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,742
What do you mean American laws?

165
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:12,942
Well, you're going hear that
honey that you arrested...

166
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,648
sing about tribal laws.

167
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:20,250
Horse shit excuses
for terrorists to...

168
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,127
put sand in my gears.

169
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,226
Is there something
you want to tell me?

170
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,789
Something specific?

171
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,468
You're a straight shooter,
aren't you? I like that.

172
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,632
Well, there is
someone specific.

173
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,944
Rene Laroque...
He's a part Indian.

174
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,239
He could be in the swamp,
killing people.

175
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,748
Lives there
like an animal.

176
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,853
Sir, before I arrest anybody...

177
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,754
I'll conduct an investigation.

178
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,292
Of course you will.

179
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,621
I'm saying it should be sooner
rather than later.

180
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,765
Let me tell you,
when the dust has settled...

181
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,700
you'll find this a nice
place to live.

182
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,064
- Isn't that right, Jake?
- Yes, Sir.

183
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,137
Real nice place.

184
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,141
I'll make sure of it.

185
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,046
Thank you, Mr Schist.

186
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,547
Jake.

187
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,711
Get that dozer moving!

188
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,194
Pa. He's kind of young
to be Sheriff?

189
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,366
Yes...
he is.

190
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,865
That's the idea.

191
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,721
- Name?
- Teri Elizabeth Richards.

192
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,689
- Occupation?
- I teach third grade.

193
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:04,625
Being arrested
sets a good example?

194
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:07,254
Standing up for your
principles does.

195
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,260
So, yes.

196
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,995
Arrested 5 times.

197
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:13,962
1 more and you get
the Dakota Ring.

198
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,075
Sheriff that swamp has been my
backyard since I was born.

199
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,601
It's part of me...

200
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,439
and I love it.

201
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,376
It's not Schist's.

202
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,983
It's ancestral
and sacred to the tribe.

203
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,587
And they saw no money.

204
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,190
Their leader, Ted Sallis
took it and ran.

205
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,320
Okay.

206
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,159
Okay, I'm listening.

207
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:45,428
No one'll see because Schist is
busy pumping money into the town.

208
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,199
But Sheriff this swamp is dying.

209
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,174
People are dying.

210
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,182
Rene Laroque.

211
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,110
Do you know him?

212
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,079
It's a small town.

213
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:07,383
- Everybody knows everybody.
- Can you help me find him?

214
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,023
He's not that easy to find.

215
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,695
Okay.

216
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,193
You can go.

217
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,530
Not charging me?

218
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,602
It's a small town.

219
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,834
Charging a teacher whose crime...

220
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,036
is caring about the land...

221
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:30,915
on my first day... That's not how
I'd like to get started.

222
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,317
You can go.

223
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,052
Fine.

224
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,376
- 'Morning, Sheriff.
- How are you doing?

225
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,247
Shouldn't diners be friendly?

226
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,940
Well, for you,
first coffee's free.

227
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,451
Thank you.

228
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,983
Second one is twice the price.

229
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,620
- There you go.
- Thanks.

230
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,901
- Morning, Sheriff.
- How are you doing?

231
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,573
What brings you here?

232
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,370
Warrant or pleasure?

233
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:11,605
- Got a sweet tooth.
- Well, Sheriff Williams...

234
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,042
meet another sugar addict.

235
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,813
This is Pete Horn.

236
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:18,479
Oh Pete, this is the nice man
that arrested me yesterday.

237
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,722
Howdy.

238
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,787
- Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.
- A pleasure, Pete.

239
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:29,094
- Do you mind?
- Here.

240
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,610
Breakfast, Sheriff?

241
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:41,474
Eggs and grits, I guess.

242
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,653
Can I help you?

243
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,483
No, I don't think you can.

244
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,417
But I can help you.

245
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,659
Welcome to Dodge City.
It's the showdown, man.

246
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:02,359
Legends here are true.
It's incredible.

247
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,031
Yeah?

248
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,934
Come to my swamp place...

249
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,040
I'll show you some things...

250
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,937
if you've the courage to...

251
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,101
Ploog!

252
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,339
What the hell you doing,
you freaky piece of shit?

253
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,509
Heel boys. Heel.

254
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,514
I told you,
don't bring them dogs.

255
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,585
Didn't realise you're the law.

256
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,211
You're lucky I didn't eat them.

257
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,246
Good luck.

258
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,359
Have a fine time with
the Bywater breakfast club.

259
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,421
I've seen this show before.
I'm going.

260
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,031
Bye Pete, take care.

261
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,695
- Got a kiss for me?
- Right.

262
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,836
Don't fill the Sheriff's head
with your bullshit, Ploog.

263
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:45,668
Don't pay him no never mind,
he's coon crazy.

264
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,070
Crazy as a coon.

265
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:51,908
That sure is
one shiny new badge.

266
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,275
- No hands on me, mister.
- Thibodeaux.

267
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,951
Wayne Thi... bo... deaux.

268
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,224
Well, take your friend, Mr.?

269
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,660
Rodney Thibodeaux.
Brothers.

270
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,924
Well, your mother must be proud.

271
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,660
So, please sit down, gentlemen.

272
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:14,164
Let a man have his coffee.

273
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:17,169
I was just fooling.

274
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,101
Just joking with you.

275
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,019
No man can stand
against it alone.

276
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,359
- What?
- Something is out there.

277
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,622
Waiting.

278
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:43,087
- She's been like this...
- Since she came.

279
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,320
It's like we're not here.

280
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,298
Tell me if anything changes.

281
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:22,556
<i>Sheriff? Fraser.
Schist wants you back at the worksite.</i>

282
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,606
Thanks for fitting us in...

283
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,709
- in to your busy schedule. Sheriff.
- Fraser could came out earlier.

284
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,045
You need to see this
for yourself.

285
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,949
You had some vandalism
here last night?

286
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:49,819
You could call it that.

287
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,390
Had to cancel a whole work day.

288
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,192
They hit every rig.
Slashed the belts, the pipes.

289
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:03,033
This time they stole dynamite.
I'm already months behind here...

290
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,573
understand?

291
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,178
Will you do anything about
Laroque or just take pictures?

292
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,976
This was done by Laroque?

293
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,821
Hell, yeah!
Red-skinned mother-fucker.

294
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,588
And that old madman,
Pete Horn...

295
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,751
him too.

296
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,864
Yeah? He's old to run a revolution.

297
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,829
Makes no difference,
you can't trust them.

298
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,230
Injuns and coloreds both.

299
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:32,996
- Steve! I...
- They hate us.

300
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,605
1st chance they strike.

301
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:38,106
They're snooping and stealing.

302
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:41,209
They'll burn this place down.

303
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:43,778
You see if they don't.

304
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,507
You can't trust them.
There's all kinds you can't trust.

305
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,878
Racist assholes top the list.

306
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,579
Come on. They think I
ripped them off.

307
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,691
But I overpaid for swamp land.

308
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,053
That crook Sallis started it.

309
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,662
- Jake!
- What?

310
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:01,766
He skipped town with the money.
One of their own.

311
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:05,926
Break the law,
you have my full attention.

312
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,002
But this is an open case...

313
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,538
until I get hard evidence.

314
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,641
Whatever you believe Sheriff,
you take care.

315
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,249
More things in that swamp
than you'll ever understand.

316
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,312
It's a dark corner of the world.

317
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:24,419
You better keep your lights on.

318
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,829
- Fraser?
<i>- Yeah. Go ahead, Sheriff.</i>

319
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,831
I'm driving from the worksite...

320
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,032
checking the swamp perimeter.

321
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,609
<i>Listen,
you be careful out there.</i>

322
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:13,596
Shit! This is ridiculous!

323
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:17,296
Is that you, Laroque?

324
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:37,149
Jake! Where are you going?

325
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,516
Did you get him?
Did you get a bead on him?

326
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,860
Goddamn it!

327
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:48,161
I ain't chasing.

328
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,701
Ain't no indian going
to make me run.

329
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:54,796
No sir.

330
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,372
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

331
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:33,568
Show me your hands.

332
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:48,350
Are you Rene Laroque?

333
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,624
Don't fucking move!
I'm Sheriff Kyle Williams.

334
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:55,997
I will put you down.

335
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,032
Go home...

336
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:06,968
or you will die.

337
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,481
Shit!

338
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,685
Jake!

339
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,958
Quit fucking around, man.

340
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:35,029
Get back up here,
finish your watch.

341
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:30,951
Jake!

342
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:36,693
Come on, man!
I'm done with fucking around!

343
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,033
Fuck!

344
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:03,348
New Sheriff...

345
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,312
meet the old Sheriff.
Jim Corely.

346
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,350
Poor guy, there's
hardly anything left of him.

347
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:13,555
He's been missing a month.
How'd you find him?

348
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:16,894
Just lucky, I guess.

349
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:19,763
Right.

350
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:23,904
Notice something? Here.

351
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,338
See these?

352
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:32,906
Bite pattern
of a large mississippitensis.

353
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,219
Common southern alligator.

354
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,520
There's no doubt about this one.
- This one?

355
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:43,759
Mind getting that?
Please?

356
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,631
County Coroner's office.

357
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:54,634
<i>- Sheriff.</i>
- Yeah

358
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:57,363
Fraser, speak up.

359
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,920
Clean up I need you
on a field trip.

360
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,184
Cool.

361
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:30,904
- I'll get my gear, Sheriff.
- Fraser.

362
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,044
You okay?

363
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,279
Now, you focus, Eric.

364
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:43,520
You can be freaked out later,
but not on the job.

365
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:29,727
- What the hell could do that?
- I don't know.

366
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,876
Could this be some kind of...

367
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:47,046
ritualistic thing?

368
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,944
I have no idea, Sheriff.

369
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,119
No idea at all.

370
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:17,776
How's a branch shoved
down a throat like that?

371
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:19,979
Let me show you something.

372
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:27,022
See the teeth?
Position of the tongue?

373
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:31,985
Sheriff, this branch wasn't
shoved in.

374
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,157
It's coming from the inside out.

375
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:43,167
- See, the other bodies, they...
- What other bodies?

376
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,076
I need a cigarette.

377
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,078
- Do you have to smoke?
- Definitely!

378
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:01,317
Sheriff. 3 of our missing persons...

379
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,950
washed up over 7 months.

380
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:09,757
Now they all had... well,
not like this, but more like Billy.

381
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:15,734
Swamp stuff growing inside them,
coming out from inside you understand?

382
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,167
This wasn't filed?

383
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,675
Corely wouldn't let me do autopsies.

384
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:25,347
He insisted I file them
as 'gator attacks.

385
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,507
What did you think they were?

386
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,308
What fucking else'd they be?

387
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:30,953
<i>Goddamn, damn it!</i>

388
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,230
What man could do that?

389
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,215
Sheriff.

390
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,926
I talked to Val.

391
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:11,788
You're going to get Rene.

392
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:13,793
Let me do my job.

393
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:16,627
- Hunt him down like an animal?
- Lf he's innocent he'll walk.

394
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:19,292
I won't just sit.

395
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,004
- He didn't do it.
- How do you know?

396
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:25,306
I saw Rene 2 miles
from Gerber's murder.

397
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:28,038
- Sheriff!
- Listen...

398
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:30,342
- I know Rene!
- Yeah, well that's pretty obvious.

399
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:33,144
- Hey, Kyle!
- What?

400
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:36,117
Schist's hired the Thibodeauxs...

401
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:40,255
- to go after Rene.
- Don't you see what's happening?

402
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,359
<i>We'd better get over there
and talk to them.</i>

403
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,360
<i>- I'll lock up.</i>
- Goddamn it!

404
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:08,451
- Do you smell that?
- That's bad.

405
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,881
Fraser!

406
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,719
What you doing, Fraser?

407
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:20,159
Shopping for your new
girlfriend there?

408
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:24,734
Well Rodney, your mama
told my mama...

409
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:28,233
Jake's getting you boys mixed up
in our investigation.

410
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:53,258
Well, well, well.
We in trouble?

411
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:57,161
- We ain't done nothing yet.
- Shut up, Wayne.

412
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:01,233
What brings you
here, Jake?

413
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:03,032
Hey! Want a beer?

414
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,467
Oh, that's right.
You on duty.

415
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:10,178
Old Jake just told us
what happened to Steve Gerber.

416
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,807
- Nasty!
- Real bad.

417
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,050
I'd appreciate you
not discussing...

418
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,753
Get them heads
out the formaldehyde. Shit!

419
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:22,256
I bet you over cooked them.

420
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:26,323
When over cooked
the skin bursts.

421
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,755
They dry all crackly looking
and weird.

422
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,399
- Fucked up?
- No, we're good.

423
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:37,040
Well lacquer them up quick.

424
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:42,271
You know how dumb Yankee
tourists like them shiny.

425
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,443
Just so there's no
misunderstanding.

426
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,745
I see anyone in that swamp
looking for Laroque...

427
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:55,185
I won't hesitate to throw
the book at you. Get up!

428
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,823
Me and my brother are
just trying to make a living.

429
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,600
No need to get unfriendly like.

430
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:06,466
Yeah well, Mr Thibodeaux...

431
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:08,600
that's as friendly as
I'm going to get.

432
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:10,701
Come on.

433
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,566
Get inside!

434
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:16,941
Stupid, Jake.

435
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:29,654
- That's the main channels.
- I want to find Laroque first.

436
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,822
Getting dark, sir.

437
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:34,960
Just take me to the
deep swamp.

438
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,199
Okay.

439
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:05,085
Shit!

440
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:08,853
I hate this swamp.

441
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,350
If I don't fix this engine...

442
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:14,124
the battery'll die
and we'll lose the lights.

443
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,866
Well, I hope you can
fix it, Fraser.

444
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,471
Man, why isn't there
a manual for these things?

445
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,576
Too many things alive out here.

446
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:37,744
I'd like to remain one of them.

447
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:05,408
Where you running?

448
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:08,217
You made the coffee too strong.

449
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,281
My shit's boiling.

450
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:14,255
Get down wind, squeeze it off.

451
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,426
Don't want Sheriff
Cranky-Pants...

452
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,289
picking up your stink.

453
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:20,896
Believe me, it'll be quick.

454
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,929
Fucking swamp!

455
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,338
Shit!

456
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,712
You shat yourself?

457
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,784
Your whole self?

458
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,984
I fell in the mud, you scrotum.

459
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:21,691
Sure it wasn't your own mud?

460
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:24,155
I'm goddamn sick of your shit.

461
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:26,452
Oh, come on.
We're brothers, Rodney.

462
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:28,922
That's my job.

463
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,963
Well, get on with this job.

464
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:33,796
Let's go get us an Injun skull.

465
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,308
Mike Ploog.

466
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:49,279
Yeah, I met him.

467
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,453
- A weird guy.
- That's Ploog all right.

468
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:56,017
Moved here about 6 months ago
to a place in the swamp.

469
00:44:57,428 --> 00:45:00,522
Says he saw the Loch Ness
monster when he was a boy.

470
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:06,029
- So, what's at Ploog's?
- He's got a couple of canoes.

471
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,802
We'll need them
if we want to get home.

472
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:13,675
Or go deeper,
if that plan still stands.

473
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:18,314
What are you afraid of, Fraser?

474
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:26,220
The Dark Water.

475
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,890
Sacred land, man.

476
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,021
If I was Rene,
I'd be there.

477
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:33,761
And I can show you to the edge...

478
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,527
but badge or no badge,
that's as far as I'll go.

479
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,795
You really believe in all this?

480
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:45,241
When a man's chest
becomes an insect's palace...

481
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:49,176
when his eyes are gone,
his limbs ain't there no more...

482
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:53,145
when I'm so scared
I'd handcuff myself...

483
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:54,942
to keep from coming to work...

484
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,747
Yeah, I believe in that.

485
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:01,623
I believe I don't want to die,
Sheriff.

486
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,395
Rodney!

487
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,472
Rodney!

488
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:21,672
Rodney!

489
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,913
I can't see you!
Wait up!

490
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:40,092
Rodney!

491
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:47,760
Damn! Mud bank!

492
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,970
Get your sorry ass back here.

493
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:11,793
What's that?

494
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:23,098
Rodney!

495
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,509
Rodney!

496
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:41,785
What the...

497
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:46,191
Rodney!

498
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:44,211
There it is. That's Ploog's.

499
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,588
Hey Ploog!

500
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,756
Mike!

501
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:58,162
Mike, are you there?
It's Fraser.

502
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,117
It's locked.

503
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:20,921
Something's wrong.

504
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,117
Don't feel right.

505
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:28,890
You stay here, wait for Ploog.
I'll find Rene.

506
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:31,029
- Hey, what? Wait...
- Fraser...

507
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:35,334
I need you to wait here
in case I flush him out.

508
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:38,935
You can grab him.

509
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:42,739
If the Thibodeauxs come by
you can handle them.

510
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:47,314
Yeah Okay, Chief.

511
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:51,877
Keep your eyes open,
Fraser.

512
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,155
It's all good, Chief.
I'll be right here.

513
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,516
Okay. Smart, Kyle.

514
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:33,593
Take the Bywater job.

515
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:36,555
Get a tan.

516
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:40,963
Beer belly.

517
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:44,300
Lots of sun.

518
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:46,806
Get fucking eaten alive.

519
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:00,447
Rene!

520
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:11,360
Wayne!

521
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,330
Goddamn it!

522
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:16,600
Make me turn my ass around,
come back just to look for you.

523
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:20,475
Son of a bitch! Wayne!

524
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:26,372
Where are you at?

525
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:31,585
Wayne? Is that you?

526
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,765
Oh Jesus, Lord!

527
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:51,099
No Wayne, no!

528
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:56,270
What the hell happened to you?

529
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:17,498
Mike Ploog, is that you?
It's Deputy Fraser.

530
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,460
Now, no goddamn sneaking up,
do you hear?

531
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:40,386
Hey Ploog!

532
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:43,816
What the hell?

533
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,132
Mike!

534
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,200
Wait up!

535
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,267
Rene!

536
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:36,712
It's Sheriff Williams.

537
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,212
I just want to talk

538
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:46,451
A couple of rednecks out here
want to do a lot more than that.

539
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:53,321
Rene, I want to talk about
Ted Sallis.

540
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:29,629
Rene, What are you doing?

541
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:42,277
Joining the hunt, Sheriff?

542
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,727
Oh man.

543
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:07,692
Mike?

544
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,871
Is somebody there?
Hello?

545
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:19,039
I told you to go home.

546
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,482
If you're not who they say,
cut me down.

547
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:25,010
Who do they say I am?

548
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,820
That you're responsible
for people disappearing.

549
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:30,818
- No.
- Then who is?

550
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:33,321
Only the swamp knows.

551
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:36,021
- Not everyone's against you.
- Oh yeah?

552
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,130
Some say you're innocent.

553
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:40,528
- No one is innocent, Sheriff.

554
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:42,898
Especially not me.

555
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:46,267
I told Schist to buy
all the Indian swamp land...

556
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:48,506
So you sold out.

557
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:52,273
We had nothing.

558
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:56,076
I thought the money would help.

559
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,787
- What went wrong?
- Ted Sallis wouldn't sell.

560
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:01,788
I thought he did sell.

561
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:04,927
That man wouldn't have sold.

562
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:07,425
And he wouldn't have run.

563
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:09,462
Sallis was murdered?

564
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,690
After he disappeared.

565
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:14,665
Schist stuck a rig right in the
centre of our sacred...

566
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:16,100
Dark Water.

567
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:18,969
Guardian won't stop
'til the oil does.

568
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:20,867
Horn said something's
out here.

569
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:24,207
We never once saw eye to eye but
Pete says prayers can stop it.

570
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,113
But I've got my own plans.

571
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:38,021
Run, or I'll kill you.

572
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:41,990
Rene!

573
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:43,689
Rene, wait!

574
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:53,306
Rene!

575
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:56,804
Hey Kyle, is that you?

576
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:04,611
- Kyle, over here.
- Fraser!

577
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:06,750
Man, it's good to see you.
Listen... Jesus!

578
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:09,254
Fraser!

579
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:02,409
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm taking pictures.

580
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:05,172
- I'm a photographer!
- Of Fraser's arm!

581
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:09,083
I tracked it through the swamp
like I've done for months.

582
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:11,416
This time I got so close.

583
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:14,218
What did you do to my Deputy?
Where's the rest of him?

584
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:16,325
Don't know.
His arm was there.

585
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:17,926
Shut up!

586
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:21,790
I've tried to get Big Foot.

587
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:24,365
A year in Nevada in Area 51.
I got zip, man, nothing.

588
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:27,202
But what I got tonight, man...

589
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,731
will streak your shorts.

590
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:33,367
We'll go to my shack, man.
I'll show you the pictures.

591
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:37,346
- Fuck me.
- You know what?

592
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:40,778
That thing's probably
sniffing us out as we speak.

593
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:43,851
You show me.

594
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:00,102
Check this out, man.

595
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:04,237
What? Bywater by night.

596
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:06,066
Look closer, Sheriff.

597
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:09,372
Who killed Fraser?
Fuck pictures!

598
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,471
Sheriff, take a closer look.
Come on, you'll see it.

599
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:13,949
It's like the nature of fear.

600
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:28,961
No, it's a trick.

601
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:31,790
- It's not possible.
- What?

602
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,430
I don't believe it.
What is that?

603
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:36,968
- That's a man.
- Yeah!

604
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:39,471
It's the man-thing, man!

605
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:42,443
All right... it's not perfect.

606
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:45,604
- But look at that thing!
- Pack your things.

607
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:48,506
It's evidence. Come with me

608
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,912
- No, I can't leave here.
- Yeah, you and all your crap...

609
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:55,081
or I'll cuff you and drag you
out on your ass!

610
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:58,658
Now!

611
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:02,654
Don't run, kids.
Carefully down the stairs.

612
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:15,167
<i>Something is out there waiting.</i>

613
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,750
Teri!

614
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,027
Hi. Is everything all right?

615
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:36,756
Fraser was killed in the swamp.

616
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:41,428
I need to see Pete Horn.

617
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:46,872
It was something he said.
I think he can help me.

618
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,472
Okay, to Pete.

619
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:53,714
Just give me a second, okay?
Kera, I need to talk with you.

620
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:21,699
Park here at the dump.
We have to walk in.

621
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:30,409
- Mary, we're here to see Pete.
- Hey Tery.

622
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:35,617
This is it.

623
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:41,854
I'm okay.

624
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,928
Pete? Pete, it's Teri.

625
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,161
Hi.

626
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:55,375
Please sit. I made tea.

627
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:57,636
- Thank you.
- You knew we'd be here?

628
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,015
It's good tea.

629
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:16,887
Pete... I need to ask you
about Rene Laroque.

630
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:21,099
He doesn't believe
Ted Sallis sold that land.

631
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:24,734
Not many who knew Ted do.

632
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:26,632
What about you?

633
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:29,538
Ted Sallis was my elder.

634
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:33,377
He knew this land was sacred.

635
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:35,949
When Schist took it...

636
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:38,920
<i>drove his pumps into it...</i>

637
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:41,417
<i>ran his pipes through it...</i>

638
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:45,320
<i>it was the end.</i>

639
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:48,525
Our stories will die with me.

640
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:55,133
Hey, come on.
Pete, listen to me.

641
01:02:57,006 --> 01:02:59,201
You're not dying anytime soon.

642
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:02,467
Remember when I took you...

643
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:04,806
to the Dark Water as a child?

644
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:07,582
I remember I was scared.

645
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:09,684
Yes.

646
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:15,189
It is full of magic both light...

647
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:19,127
and dark.

648
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:30,936
Our most powerful
guardian spirit...

649
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,007
lives in the Dark Water.

650
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:39,079
It protects what our
ancestors called...

651
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:41,576
the nexus of all realities.

652
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:48,119
The guardian has become
very angry.

653
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,362
For the blood spilled...

654
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,998
it seeks blood.

655
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:09,836
Pete...

656
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:12,503
Look, I'm a cop.

657
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:15,480
I can't believe
in indian spirits and magic.

658
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:19,587
What you believe doesn't matter.

659
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:21,480
You're not from this place.

660
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:24,458
You're not from any place.

661
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:28,086
Where's Ted Sallis, Pete?

662
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:32,233
- Is he killing people?
- Kyle!

663
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,260
With or without Rene?

664
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:36,367
I didn't bring you to do this.

665
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:38,637
Maybe he's in the swamp.

666
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:42,007
Maybe the swamp is in him.

667
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,441
Whoever or whatever is out
there I saw it.

668
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:50,279
What did you see?

669
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:53,685
I don't know.

670
01:04:53,923 --> 01:04:55,891
You know what you saw.

671
01:04:57,994 --> 01:05:02,021
- It has chosen who will die.
- Who will die, Pete?

672
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,095
Everyone.

673
01:05:09,872 --> 01:05:11,499
Hey, Pete.

674
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:15,137
Come on, I'm sorry.

675
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:17,977
Sit down, okay?

676
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:20,208
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

677
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,109
I'm tired.

678
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,288
Please go now.

679
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:31,554
Just rest.

680
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:48,108
You didn't have to do that.

681
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:51,413
- He's an old man!
- He knows what's going on.

682
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:54,212
Listen, what are you saying?

683
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:55,907
Listen, Teri.

684
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:59,146
Last night something ripped
Fraser up like a fucking puppet!

685
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:03,892
Look, I'm going out in the swamp
to stop the killing.

686
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:07,593
It's my fault Fraser died.

687
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:09,822
Don't know if I can protect you.

688
01:06:10,666 --> 01:06:12,463
Hey Kyle.

689
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:17,130
None of this is your fault.

690
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:55,368
Are you investigating murder...

691
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,604
or our educational system?

692
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:02,080
What's your link with Laroque?

693
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:04,081
He worked for me.

694
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:07,187
Most people around here do. So?

695
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:12,961
What?

696
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:18,924
- She taste as good as she looks?
- Fuck you.

697
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:23,170
Listen, my deputy's dead.

698
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:25,936
I think you're lying.
I'm calling in the FBI.

699
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,237
I can't believe this.

700
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:30,245
Are you threatening me?

701
01:07:30,913 --> 01:07:33,575
Consider yourself
relieved of your duty, Sheriff.

702
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:36,477
- I take orders from County.
- I am the County.

703
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,521
We'll sort it by morning.

704
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,246
Until then stay out of my way!

705
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:43,885
That goes for you too, dipshit.

706
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:49,589
- Pa! Damn!
- Get in the car!

707
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:53,631
Just what is it...

708
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,661
you think you know?

709
01:07:57,273 --> 01:07:59,605
You know nothing about Bywater.

710
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:02,303
This town was nothing before me.

711
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:05,104
No one's muscling me out.

712
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:09,578
Not the FBI or Rene Laroque
and certainly not...

713
01:08:11,387 --> 01:08:13,617
some two-bit Yankee cocksucker...

714
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:16,824
with a badge.

715
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:20,428
Fuck you!

716
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,443
What's with the Thibodeauxs?

717
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:43,983
- Didn't come back.
- Damn it, Jake!

718
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:46,678
- You were supposed to go too!
- I was only trying...

719
01:08:46,822 --> 01:08:48,881
Yes, I was only trying
and never doing.

720
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:51,618
That's your problem.

721
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:54,329
If you learn nothing,
you learn this:

722
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:57,054
You want something done,
do it yourself.

723
01:08:57,333 --> 01:09:00,029
Because you cannot rely
on anybody.

724
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:02,937
Not even your own son.

725
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:05,505
What'll we do about this, then?

726
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:09,304
We're going to finish it.

727
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:11,873
Tonight.

728
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:14,973
I want Laroque dead.

729
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:19,249
What about
Dudley Do Right?

730
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:21,547
He keeps on digging?

731
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:23,257
We'll let him dig.

732
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:27,155
It's his own grave.

733
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:50,612
Give me the strength.

734
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:53,448
The killing ends tonight.

735
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:23,107
I think you should call the FBI.

736
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:25,978
The Bureau could take days.

737
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:27,986
Schist'll go after Rene tonight.

738
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:31,115
I've run round that swamp
since I was a kid.

739
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,661
I can help.

740
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:36,160
Help by staying away
until all this is over.

741
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:37,993
The swamp play...

742
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:40,860
tricks at night.
You don't have to do it.

743
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:44,130
Teri, listen, please.
Jake could be out there.

744
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:48,710
Schist, Rene.
God knows what else.

745
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:55,845
Can you promise me, please?
Just don't go into that swamp.

746
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:03,856
I'll be here when you get back.

747
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:06,924
And you better get back.

748
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:11,393
Okay?

749
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:45,320
Schist.

750
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:47,828
Pa, I think I hear something.

751
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:01,432
I know you.

752
01:14:02,037 --> 01:14:03,595
I know you...

753
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:05,701
and I am not afraid.

754
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:08,908
Take my life and be done.

755
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,455
- Sheriff's office.
<i>- Is the Sheriff in?</i>

756
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:58,319
- Val? It's Teri.
<i>- Is he in? It's urgent.</i>

757
01:14:58,527 --> 01:15:01,860
No. I'll give him a message.
What's up?

758
01:15:02,064 --> 01:15:05,261
<i>Corely died of unnatural causes.</i>

759
01:15:05,934 --> 01:15:09,062
- Pulled a bullet from his spine.
- A bullet?

760
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:11,867
<i>It was at close range.</i>

761
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,066
Semi-automatic hand-gun.
A 45.

762
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:16,404
<i>I think Corely knew who
killed him.</i>

763
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:18,137
<i>Where is Kyle?</i>

764
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:20,215
He's out in the swamp.

765
01:15:43,138 --> 01:15:46,972
- Heel! Heel!
- Get your fucking dogs off!

766
01:15:47,342 --> 01:15:48,741
I got them.

767
01:15:49,144 --> 01:15:51,840
Ploog! I told you
to stay in fucking town!

768
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:54,681
Can you smell that, Sheriff?

769
01:15:57,753 --> 01:16:00,586
'Cause... it's the perfume
of my future. Point, click...

770
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:03,581
Fame.

771
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:06,755
There it is. Got to go.
Good luck, man.

772
01:16:07,095 --> 01:16:10,428
- The cover of Life magazine!
- Life Magazine?

773
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,094
Life Magazine went out of business,
you fucking idiot.

774
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:46,732
Jake? Jake!

775
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:06,410
Be damned if you're taking
my picture, asshole!

776
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:15,256
Pa!

777
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:09,750
Kyle!

778
01:19:20,522 --> 01:19:21,819
Schist.

779
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:25,714
- Kyle!
- Jesus!

780
01:20:25,854 --> 01:20:27,446
Teri, I almost shot you.

781
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:29,352
Thank God!

782
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:34,290
Had to find you.
Corely was murdered.

783
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:37,060
Val found a 45 slug
in his spine.

784
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:39,625
I just found Ploog.

785
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,637
- He's dead. Shot.
- Jesus!

786
01:20:43,205 --> 01:20:45,196
Sallis didn't take the money.

787
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:47,273
Schist killed him.

788
01:20:47,442 --> 01:20:49,376
- Corely knew so he died.
- Rene?

789
01:20:49,444 --> 01:20:50,968
The last who knows the truth.

790
01:20:51,112 --> 01:20:53,546
I'll lead to the Dark Water.

791
01:20:53,715 --> 01:20:56,946
- That's where he's hiding...
- You've known this all along?

792
01:20:58,253 --> 01:21:00,585
- I knew he was innocent.
- Teri!

793
01:21:00,755 --> 01:21:02,655
You won't find
the Dark Water without me!

794
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:06,089
- Okay?
- Okay.

795
01:21:07,963 --> 01:21:09,760
Just keep up.

796
01:21:19,774 --> 01:21:22,641
- You know where you're going?
- Yeah, it's down here.

797
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:27,110
I thought about what Pete said.
He might be right.

798
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:29,311
About what?
Oh shit!

799
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:32,516
About that.

800
01:21:35,457 --> 01:21:37,118
This way, come on.

801
01:21:41,162 --> 01:21:42,459
Oh fuck!

802
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:47,796
Step.

803
01:22:37,185 --> 01:22:39,210
Stop right there, Rene!

804
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:50,124
I'm begging you...
I'm just aching for an excuse.

805
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:14,012
It doesn't matter...

806
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:16,691
The swamp will have you.

807
01:23:18,526 --> 01:23:19,993
This way.

808
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:23,354
Last stretch
before the Dark Water.

809
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:25,692
You can't see a thing in here.

810
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:28,226
Oh shit!

811
01:23:29,104 --> 01:23:31,436
God, what is that?

812
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:33,304
Teri, go!

813
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,440
Go, Teri, go.
Just keep moving!

814
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:51,757
Jesus Christ.

815
01:23:56,431 --> 01:23:57,955
Do you see anything?

816
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:00,361
I think there's something
in the water.

817
01:24:03,004 --> 01:24:04,528
What's that?

818
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,770
Go! Move!
It's behind us!

819
01:24:08,076 --> 01:24:09,771
I can't see anything!

820
01:24:10,478 --> 01:24:12,173
I'm here.

821
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:21,082
How much further?

822
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:23,656
- How much further?
- I don't know.

823
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:27,217
Quick! Go!

824
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:34,625
You don't scare me with that
hocus... pocus... boy.

825
01:24:35,603 --> 01:24:40,097
Your friend, Ted Sallis
before he died...

826
01:24:41,309 --> 01:24:44,608
before I buried him here
under this rig.

827
01:24:46,648 --> 01:24:49,446
- You know what he said?
- Fuck you!

828
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:52,250
He said I was setting him free.

829
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:57,924
How about you?

830
01:24:58,193 --> 01:25:01,390
- You all want to be free, Rene?
- It's not as dark up ahead.

831
01:25:01,696 --> 01:25:03,789
- I can see a clearing.
- Quiet.

832
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:06,023
- It's this way.
- No.

833
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:08,766
There, I can see it.

834
01:25:17,145 --> 01:25:18,942
Oh God! Rene?

835
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,048
We get the fuck out of here.

836
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:23,448
What are you doing?

837
01:25:26,321 --> 01:25:27,788
I'm sorry, Teri.

838
01:25:28,656 --> 01:25:30,248
I'm sorry.

839
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:32,991
My sin put this here.

840
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:36,123
- What?
- It's my penance to take it down.

841
01:25:37,232 --> 01:25:38,722
Freeze!

842
01:25:39,534 --> 01:25:41,399
No!

843
01:25:45,006 --> 01:25:47,099
- God!
- Pass me the gun, girl!

844
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:52,741
- Something's chasing us!
- Give me the gun!

845
01:25:54,616 --> 01:25:57,312
You're a murderer, Schist.

846
01:25:58,119 --> 01:26:00,781
You should've kept
your Yankee nose out!

847
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:03,485
You're going to die.

848
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:07,149
I suppose you're going to kill me.

849
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:11,489
No, he is.

850
01:26:13,268 --> 01:26:14,997
Jake?

851
01:27:27,442 --> 01:27:28,704
Shit!

852
01:27:30,378 --> 01:27:31,675
Here it comes!

853
01:27:36,184 --> 01:27:37,947
Rene, watch out!

854
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:03,972
Teri!

855
01:28:06,648 --> 01:28:08,047
Run!

856
01:28:09,317 --> 01:28:11,046
I'll set you free.

857
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:14,417
Teri, move!

858
01:28:17,392 --> 01:28:19,656
Get down! Now, Teri!

859
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:35,000
