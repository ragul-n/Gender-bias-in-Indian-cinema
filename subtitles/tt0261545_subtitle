00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:28,298
MAY 27, 1997 - HUBLI

2
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:50,553
What is life? This is life

3
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:58,430
What is life? This is life

4
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:13,875
Ships sink in the
clean pond of life

5
00:01:13,954 --> 00:01:21,690
No one can live
in these lonely ruins

6
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:36,466
Ships sink in the
clean pond of life

7
00:01:37,077 --> 00:01:44,006
No one can live
in these lonely ruins

8
00:01:44,818 --> 00:01:51,917
Where there is life,
there is also death?

9
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:59,764
What is life? This is life

10
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:07,963
What is life? This is life

11
00:02:23,023 --> 00:02:30,259
Leave aside your
disappointments and enjoy your life

12
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:37,737
Let your life flow out

13
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:53,512
Leave aside your
disappointments and enjoy your life

14
00:02:53,887 --> 00:03:00,793
Let your life flow out

15
00:03:01,561 --> 00:03:08,831
It always dawns
after every night

16
00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:16,399
What is life? This is life

17
00:03:16,676 --> 00:03:25,846
What is life? This is life

18
00:03:58,018 --> 00:04:02,455
MARCH 16, 1999 - PUNE

19
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:16,425
- Aditi! - Coming!

20
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:19,233
Aditi, where's my tie?

21
00:04:20,774 --> 00:04:24,335
I have a meeting
in the afternoon.

22
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:27,244
And it will
continue till evening.

23
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:30,377
Aniket... are you ready?

24
00:04:32,886 --> 00:04:38,916
Pune's weather is nice! No.
Just a minute... I'll phone Shree.

25
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:45,558
Damn it! The phone
had to ring now!

26
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:51,702
Yes.?? Who's speaking?
- Shree, Ravi here.

27
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:58,307
Dr. Ravi Bapat? Do I know you?

28
00:04:58,378 --> 00:05:00,312
Hey, stop pretending!

29
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,339
Pretending? Rascal! Where have
you been? Were you dead?

30
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:06,912
Couldn't you at least
phone once in a way?

31
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:08,215
It's nothing like that.

32
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:16,928
But yes! Although I'm in Goa, I
keep track of everything in Pune!

33
00:05:16,997 --> 00:05:19,693
Then why have you phoned today?

34
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:21,700
I'm phoning from Pune. - What!

35
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:26,532
Meghna is also with me.

36
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:28,540
I'm here for some
property matters.

37
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:30,473
Great! So, it's dinner
at my place then!

38
00:05:30,543 --> 00:05:32,477
But, Shree... - No excuses!

39
00:05:32,545 --> 00:05:34,445
Rascal! You didn't even
come for Aniket's engagement!

40
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:37,477
I really wanted to
come but was unable to.

41
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,848
And we'll have
dinner some other time.

42
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,218
I have an appointment with
the estate agent this evening.

43
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:45,850
And I have to return to
Goa tomorrow morning.

44
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:48,821
Actually, I phoned
to congratulate...

45
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:51,796
...Aniket on his engagement.

46
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:54,891
No way! Congratulating over
the phone won't do!

47
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:56,367
Shree, try to understand!

48
00:05:56,436 --> 00:05:59,894
You have an evening appointment?
- Yes. - Then come down.

49
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:02,634
But don't you have
to go to office?

50
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:07,337
Catch a taxi right away and
come here. I'll wait for you.

51
00:06:07,414 --> 00:06:09,177
Listen to me... - No arguments!

52
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:14,913
Hey! What's this? - I'm
bunking office today!

53
00:06:14,988 --> 00:06:16,353
But you have two
appointments today

54
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:19,487
Cancel them! My friend, Ravi
Bapat, from Goa is here.

55
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:24,727
Aditi, he's a childhood friend.

56
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:28,533
Go to office and
cancel my appointments.

57
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:29,727
Also bring Revati her

58
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:31,828
But she must have gone
to office. - Bring her here!

59
00:06:32,472 --> 00:06:34,872
Let Ravi and Meghna know
what I'm destined for!

60
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,569
I'll go and prepare lunch.

61
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:39,302
Hey listen! Make
something very tangy...

62
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:41,245
...The doctor is fond of food!

63
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:01,233
I'm already feeling high
with the second peg!

64
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:03,325
I am not used to
drinking in the afternoons.

65
00:07:04,237 --> 00:07:06,398
Even after two bottles of
beer, you are still sober!

66
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:12,845
I live without any tension,
I drink without any tension!

67
00:07:14,247 --> 00:07:15,441
If you want to live in Goa...

68
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:20,475
...you must imbibe
its elated spirit in you

69
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:23,414
After finishing my practice, I
return home at 11-11.30 a.m.

70
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,690
I like to have beer in the
afternoons, so I drink beer.

71
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,756
I enjoy life!

72
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:31,891
You are so fortunate! You
have freedom from tensions.

73
00:07:31,965 --> 00:07:33,626
And that too, freedom in Goa!

74
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:38,302
But look at me! I'm
slogging in Pune!

75
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:40,305
But you're making money too!

76
00:07:41,274 --> 00:07:43,242
What do I do with it! Eat it?!

77
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,571
Well, with so much money, you
can make anything of it and eat

78
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,811
But for now, just
eat some cashews!

79
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:53,810
Does your house
face the sea or not?

80
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:55,752
So pleasing to the eyes, right?

81
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:58,489
Yes! My house is right
opposite the sea.

82
00:07:58,825 --> 00:08:00,292
Here's my house,
and there's the sea.

83
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:02,785
And in the middle is the beach

84
00:08:05,398 --> 00:08:07,195
Some guys have all the luck!

85
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,663
A house in Goa, a sea opposite
the house, a beach midway.

86
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:12,432
...a pleasing sight
of lovely girls!

87
00:08:14,808 --> 00:08:16,332
Some with a one piece suit...

88
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:18,673
...some wearing a bikini
and some topless!!

89
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:21,708
The old man is beginning
to feel young!

90
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:25,513
Who the hell is old! Rascal!
The heart is still young!

91
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:31,856
And you scoundrel! You didn't
marry for so many years!

92
00:08:32,425 --> 00:08:34,325
When you broke off with Sanya...

93
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:35,486
...you'd said that you
would never mar

94
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:37,626
So how did you get married then?

95
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:41,663
Of course, anyone looking at
Meghna would have done the same.

96
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:42,865
Yet...

97
00:08:43,403 --> 00:08:44,734
I wouldn't have got married.

98
00:08:46,506 --> 00:08:49,475
But Meghna and I met two years
back during a Himalayan trek.

99
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:53,978
Friendship blossomed.

100
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:05,484
I proposed to her a day
before the trek ended.

101
00:09:07,894 --> 00:09:09,418
And within a few days
after we came back...

102
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:10,359
...she even accepted my proposal

103
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:15,262
Of course, she had told me
everything about herself.

104
00:09:16,402 --> 00:09:18,563
About her first marriage
that had failed.

105
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:20,199
About her divorce.

106
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:23,301
She has two daughters
from her first marriage.

107
00:09:23,643 --> 00:09:25,235
The oldest is Radhika, the
younger one is Shravani.

108
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:27,443
The oldest is 15 years old
and the younger one is 13.

109
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:30,246
Do they manage to
live by themselves?

110
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,880
They have gone with
their father - Prashant Vaidya.

111
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:35,314
He lives in Goa.

112
00:09:35,788 --> 00:09:36,777
Prashant Vaidya.

113
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,587
I am very clear cut about
my opinion in this matter.

114
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:41,523
We have separated but even...

115
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:42,618
...he has to share the
responsibility of the girl

116
00:09:43,363 --> 00:09:44,955
They are as much his
daughters as they are, mine!

117
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:48,825
It's a different issue that
even I was his wife.

118
00:09:50,603 --> 00:09:53,401
But he never thought he had a
responsibility towards his wife.

119
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:00,242
Please don't feel awkward...

120
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:02,678
...Anyway, we've been divorced
for 4 years now

121
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:07,212
He had an affair with
his business associate.

122
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:11,518
When I learnt about
it, I felt miserable.

123
00:10:12,358 --> 00:10:16,260
But I felt worse that Prashant
didn't see anything wrong in it.

124
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:18,824
"So what? I've made a mistake."

125
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,902
"Why unnecessarily speak
about loyalty and fidelity?"

126
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,834
This is what he'd say.

127
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:34,946
He just didn't know what a man
woman relationship was about!

128
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:37,410
And even if he did,
he didn't care about it.

129
00:10:42,622 --> 00:10:44,715
I found Ravi. A gem of a man.

130
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:46,951
Have your girls accepted him?

131
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,885
Accepted? They are closer
to Ravi than to me!

132
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:52,593
By the way, what do you do?

133
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,891
Me? I'm a housewife.

134
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:57,569
Don't you do anything else?!

135
00:10:58,338 --> 00:10:59,828
There's a lot to
do at home, so...

136
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:02,198
So?! Do something!

137
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:03,943
But why?

138
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:07,773
Look at me.

139
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:08,609
After I got divorced...

140
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:11,609
...I felt I should have done
something earlier.

141
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:15,647
You should never mortgage your
self-respect with anybody.

142
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:17,719
And most certainly
not with a man.

143
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:22,323
I have opened my own
boutique, it's doing well.

144
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,755
And what's really good is that
I am standing on my own feet!

145
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:28,661
I don't need to depend on a man.

146
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:32,433
Even you do something.
All of us must!

147
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:34,395
It's too late now.

148
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:37,267
Are you mad? Time
never runs out.

149
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:43,678
Vithal, open the door. May be,
Aniket and Revati is coming.

150
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:47,786
Ravi, Revati is my future daughter-in-law.

151
00:11:54,494 --> 00:11:58,692
Revati, this is Dr. Ravi Bapat,
A very good friend of mine.

152
00:12:09,642 --> 00:12:11,234
Aniket, you are a true jeweller.

153
00:12:11,911 --> 00:12:13,344
You know how to gauge a gem!

154
00:12:13,413 --> 00:12:15,381
After all, whose son is he?

155
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:20,216
Doesn't he look handsome?
...Just like his father!

156
00:12:23,756 --> 00:12:27,783
Go ahead! Why put on a charade
of seeking my permission?

157
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,760
Anyway, after marriage,
you will do as you please.

158
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:35,365
Well-said! By the way,
Revati, what do you do?

159
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:37,326
I am a Computer
Science graduate.

160
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:39,568
And I work for a computer firm.

161
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,267
How often have I
asked her to quit the job!

162
00:12:42,642 --> 00:12:45,611
What do we lack that our
son's wife needs to work!

163
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:47,808
But this girl just
does not listen!

164
00:12:57,757 --> 00:13:00,419
Revati, Quit your job.

165
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,627
Don't, Revati! What you're
doing, is absolutely correct.

166
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:13,828
All right! Revati, if you want
to work, join my company.

167
00:13:14,307 --> 00:13:17,674
- I'll never do that! - Why?

168
00:13:17,743 --> 00:13:18,937
Will someone eat you there?!

169
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:22,575
It will be his firm. There won't
be any fear or competition!

170
00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:24,711
There will be no
motivation to work

171
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:26,842
I don't want such a job!

172
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:30,355
Continue to work where you are!

173
00:13:30,423 --> 00:13:32,448
Hey! Are you a friend or a foe?

174
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:35,688
I will plead against you
in your wife's court!

175
00:13:35,761 --> 00:13:36,853
Plead?

176
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,860
She is Aniket's...

177
00:13:41,934 --> 00:13:44,459
Okay, okay! His
future wife, right

178
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:48,566
And, Revati, Meghna
is the beautiful...

179
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:52,008
...wife of this old man Ravi

180
00:13:52,912 --> 00:13:56,905
You may not believe it, but she
is the mother of two young girl

181
00:14:00,686 --> 00:14:02,677
That's precisely
why I married her!

182
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:06,282
A beautiful lady with two
readymade daughters!

183
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:07,849
Readymade daughters? Meaning?

184
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:10,386
They are from my first
husband. I was a divorcee.

185
00:14:16,903 --> 00:14:19,235
And I must have done
something good in my last life.

186
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:22,240
To have found
Meghna in this life.

187
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:25,769
In the desert of my
life... uh... what is it?

188
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:28,370
Oh yes! She
entered as an oasis!

189
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:32,508
Well-said! Fantastic!

190
00:14:32,585 --> 00:14:34,485
Aditi, bring my diary.

191
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:35,714
Aditi, bring my diary.

192
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:39,280
Write it later. - I'm
drunk! I'll forget it later!

193
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:43,723
Vithal, open the door.

194
00:14:45,631 --> 00:14:47,724
Hay, there's no need to ask
for a diary. Phone me and ask.

195
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:49,995
Whenever we talk
of our marriage...

196
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:51,900
...I always say this
and impress her!

197
00:14:57,643 --> 00:14:58,905
Madam, a registered
post for you.

198
00:14:58,978 --> 00:14:59,672
- For me? - Yes.

199
00:15:00,546 --> 00:15:01,740
Aditi's letter? Give it here.

200
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:08,415
- It's for Aditi, isn't
it? - So what?

201
00:15:08,888 --> 00:15:11,550
This is ridiculous! It's your
letter, you read it!

202
00:15:11,624 --> 00:15:14,320
But she is my wife. What
difference does it make?

203
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:25,598
Whose letter is it?

204
00:15:38,684 --> 00:15:43,348
This is incredible!
Absolutely amazing!

205
00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:44,616
What is the matter, dad?

206
00:15:49,662 --> 00:15:50,890
Shree, I don't know
what's happening...

207
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:51,930
...Will you please tell me?

208
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:53,898
What's written in this?

209
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:56,626
My wife has
suddenly struck it big!

210
00:15:59,772 --> 00:16:05,836
A man named Malhar Kamat
died in Hubli last week.

211
00:16:06,545 --> 00:16:10,743
He's left his inheritance
in my wife's name!

212
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:14,911
A 15 acre land, an
ancestral mansion...

213
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:21,415
...plenty of gold,
and Rs.860,000/- in cash!

214
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:25,828
My wife has hit a jackpot!

215
00:16:35,374 --> 00:16:36,306
Who's Malhar Kamat?

216
00:16:37,043 --> 00:16:41,707
Who cares! He has left
a treasure for my wife!

217
00:16:41,981 --> 00:16:44,677
My dear wife, if I
ever need money...

218
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,615
...then do lend me some, okay?

219
00:16:49,322 --> 00:16:51,381
Aditi, was Malhar a relative?

220
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:55,586
No. I used to learn music from
him some years back.

221
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:59,490
What a union between
rhythm and melody!

222
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:02,359
The guru has left his
inheritance for his disciple!

223
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:05,436
Wow, maestro!

224
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:07,703
Salutations to you, my wife!

225
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,266
Shree, that's enough.
Let's go and eat now.

226
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:13,642
What's the hurry?
Drink some more!

227
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:23,419
Shall I get you some more booze?

228
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,397
- Have Ravi and
Meghna left? - Yes.

229
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:34,695
They ate before
going, didn't they?

230
00:17:35,735 --> 00:17:37,862
Obviously, Shree!
It was so late...

231
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:39,427
...It was 3 by the time
lunch was over

232
00:17:43,342 --> 00:17:44,775
I should not drink at all.

233
00:17:46,345 --> 00:17:48,643
Thank God! At least,
you realised that!

234
00:17:57,957 --> 00:17:58,719
Should I massage your head?

235
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:02,188
Who's Kamat?

236
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:08,766
Malhar Kamat - I used to
learn music from him.

237
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:10,827
Did I ever meet him?

238
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,563
Yes. Once, when you
had returned from a tour.

239
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:18,643
And the second time,
after Aniket was born.

240
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:27,612
He had come to see Aniket and
brought him a gold bangle. Right?

241
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:32,185
After that, you completely
stopped learning music.

242
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:34,516
Who would have
looked after Aniket then?

243
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:38,487
He never came
after that, did he?

244
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:41,233
No.

245
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:45,431
- Was he married?

246
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:47,372
How would I know!

247
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:53,344
Why am I questioning you!

248
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,842
Were Ravi and Meghna very upset?

249
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,214
They didn't express it... but
they must be a little upset.

250
00:19:01,387 --> 00:19:02,149
I'm too much!

251
00:19:02,655 --> 00:19:05,419
I should apologise.
I'll phone him.

252
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:17,593
I'm sorry, I drank
a bit too much.

253
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:22,468
A bit too much? .
...That was in excess!

254
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,172
Leave alone me,
you should have...

255
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:26,739
...thought about your
daughter-in-law!

256
00:19:28,714 --> 00:19:30,204
But the mood was such!

257
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,943
And then, I met both of
you after so many years.

258
00:19:36,522 --> 00:19:37,489
Otherwise, I don't
drink so much.

259
00:19:38,924 --> 00:19:39,913
Indeed! Should I
inquire in the city?

260
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:40,781
Go ahead!

261
00:19:42,328 --> 00:19:45,229
And suppose you're
proved wrong, then?

262
00:19:46,298 --> 00:19:47,822
Then I'll give you a party.

263
00:19:52,037 --> 00:19:54,301
The next time, we'll have a
sober celebration, okay?

264
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,567
In fact, the next time,
come with Aditi to Goa.

265
00:20:02,314 --> 00:20:03,576
O' God! You won't improve!

266
00:20:08,354 --> 00:20:10,618
- What was he saying?
- What can he say?

267
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:12,817
He phoned to apologise.

268
00:20:13,325 --> 00:20:15,759
He's a very self-centered
and pompous man.

269
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:21,399
You've met him
for the first time...

270
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:22,996
...so how would you
know about him?

271
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:24,860
It doesn't take me too
long to know such people.

272
00:20:26,338 --> 00:20:28,306
I've spent 17 years of my
life with such a man.

273
00:20:30,643 --> 00:20:32,235
Shreekant Pandit is one of them!

274
00:20:42,588 --> 00:20:48,288
Write tomorrow. There was so
much of work today, I'm tired!

275
00:20:49,428 --> 00:20:51,293
Have I ever written
about today's events...

276
00:20:51,363 --> 00:20:52,728
...in my diary, the next day?

277
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:55,727
Go to sleep. I'll write the
diary and then sleep.

278
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:02,671
Switch on the table lamp.
I'm switching off the light.

279
00:21:07,713 --> 00:21:09,237
"19 June, 1999"

280
00:21:11,016 --> 00:21:15,646
"Dr. Ravi Bapat and Meghna
came home today from Goa."

281
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:18,322
"I invited both
of them for lunch."

282
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:23,419
"They were going to come home,
so I did not go to office."

283
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:27,361
"While the party was on...

284
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,799
...there was a registered post
at noon, in Aditi's name."

285
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:36,007
"A man named Malhar Kamat...

286
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:41,976
...left his entire property in
Aditi's name before dying."

287
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:47,570
He is not letting me fill my pot

288
00:22:47,646 --> 00:22:53,414
He is not letting me fill my pot

289
00:22:55,054 --> 00:22:56,419
What's wrong? Sing.

290
00:22:56,989 --> 00:22:58,889
No, I'm not in the mood today.

291
00:22:59,358 --> 00:23:01,849
No? Don't you want to
practise singing today?

292
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:03,755
Singing is beyond me!

293
00:23:04,263 --> 00:23:05,389
- Then sing that. - What?

294
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:10,424
"Singing is beyond me!"

295
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,862
Don't laugh. Sing!

296
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:36,785
Tell me, how I'll sing The
tone is not in sync.

297
00:24:34,987 --> 00:24:50,563
Tell me, how I'll sing The
tone is not in sync.

298
00:25:09,655 --> 00:25:13,785
Rail is running here and there
like the naughty Radha

299
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:17,727
Sound of its whistle
reaches the sky

300
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:21,664
The bell on the cows
neck ring when they come

301
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:25,635
Sound of morning ragas come
with the mountain winds

302
00:25:25,704 --> 00:25:29,572
Music seems to come
from the nature itself...

303
00:25:29,641 --> 00:25:36,945
...How do I sing now?

304
00:25:39,751 --> 00:25:54,997
Tell me, how I'll sing
The tone is not in sync.

305
00:25:55,334 --> 00:26:03,571
Tell me, how I'll sing
The tone is not in sync.

306
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:14,952
He is not letting me fill my pot

307
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,184
He is not letting me fill my pot

308
00:26:40,012 --> 00:26:41,206
I arm not joking. Music
flowers in your veins!

309
00:26:41,914 --> 00:26:44,940
When you sing, there's
nothing else I can hear.

310
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,381
Please! Don't praise me so much!

311
00:26:48,453 --> 00:26:50,648
I'm just cannot sing the
tune that you ask me to!

312
00:26:50,722 --> 00:26:52,656
No way! I'm not flattering you.

313
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:55,522
Your voice is God-gifted.

314
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,389
All right! What will you have?
The usual.

315
00:27:00,699 --> 00:27:02,189
Vithal! - Coming!

316
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:04,896
- Bring two cups of
tea. - Make that three.

317
00:27:05,404 --> 00:27:05,870
Hey! When did you come?

318
00:27:06,238 --> 00:27:06,727
Just 5 minutes back.

319
00:27:07,406 --> 00:27:08,236
Why didn't you call me then?

320
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,432
I didn't deem it
right to disturb such...

321
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:11,533
...a melodious singing session.

322
00:27:12,477 --> 00:27:15,378
Shree, he is Malhar Kamat, a
highly qualified maestro of music

323
00:27:19,818 --> 00:27:20,944
And he's Shreekant, my husband.

324
00:27:21,286 --> 00:27:25,188
- How does my wife sing?
- Her voice is God-gifted!

325
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:30,259
I know. That's why I ask
her to keep practising.

326
00:27:30,996 --> 00:27:33,726
Indeed! She should
never stop that.

327
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,860
Her lovely voice can make her...

328
00:27:36,335 --> 00:27:38,895
...a professional singer
in a year or two

329
00:27:39,604 --> 00:27:40,832
Nonsense! No career for her!

330
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,870
She has to learn music, only
because she's fond of it.

331
00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:46,467
Not for money. To make
money is my job.

332
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:49,480
And that, I am. There's no
need for my wife to work

333
00:27:50,983 --> 00:27:53,645
She has to learn to sing,
solely for her joys...

334
00:27:54,753 --> 00:27:56,311
...and not to make money

335
00:28:01,226 --> 00:28:01,783
Tea.

336
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,318
You've brought tea
at the right time

337
00:28:21,847 --> 00:28:23,610
- Is breakfast ready,
Vithal? - Yes, it is.

338
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,749
Shree! It's 8 O'clock!

339
00:28:34,026 --> 00:28:34,890
Coming!

340
00:28:52,044 --> 00:28:54,638
- Breakfast is ready.
- No breakfast today, Aditi.

341
00:28:55,547 --> 00:28:56,536
Why not?

342
00:28:56,982 --> 00:28:58,711
There's work pending...

343
00:28:58,784 --> 00:29:01,218
...Yesterday's appointments
have to be attended to

344
00:29:01,553 --> 00:29:04,784
But eat something.

345
00:29:05,424 --> 00:29:06,448
I have to rush.

346
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:07,690
I'll eat in the office.

347
00:29:12,764 --> 00:29:13,662
Dad, where are you off to?

348
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,857
I'm in a hurry. Eat your
breakfast and come.

349
00:29:16,935 --> 00:29:19,301
- I'll take just 2 minutes...
- Take your time, son!

350
00:29:25,243 --> 00:29:27,575
- What did you say?! - Nothing!

351
00:29:28,246 --> 00:29:30,714
Mom, I'm famished! Quickly
give me something to eat.

352
00:29:31,383 --> 00:29:34,181
Stop behaving like a child!
You are engaged now!

353
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:38,654
So what? Nothing in this world
compares to my mom!

354
00:30:44,556 --> 00:30:46,251
"I received a fax at the
office from Singapore."

355
00:30:48,693 --> 00:30:49,819
"I decided to go there."

356
00:30:51,396 --> 00:30:52,954
"I had to supervise
the company's...

357
00:30:53,665 --> 00:30:55,428
...final phase of an
electrical setting

358
00:30:56,568 --> 00:30:58,297
"I'd just returned from Nepal. I
had some office work even there."

359
00:31:05,443 --> 00:31:06,967
I won't listen!
This is too much!

360
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,444
I understand everything, Shree!

361
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:11,914
You'd said that once you
return fro Nepal...

362
00:31:11,983 --> 00:31:14,918
...you'll be here for 3 months!

363
00:31:15,587 --> 00:31:17,214
- You think I enjoy
doing this?! - Who knows!

364
00:31:17,522 --> 00:31:19,217
- What do you mean?
- What else, Shree!

365
00:31:19,624 --> 00:31:20,818
In our 2 years of marriage...

366
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,255
...you've not stayed home
for even months!

367
00:31:24,296 --> 00:31:25,763
You are always away! It's
Mauritius, Singapore...

368
00:31:26,364 --> 00:31:27,456
...Colombo... and God
knows where else!

369
00:31:27,966 --> 00:31:29,558
There's just no
end to your tours!

370
00:31:30,468 --> 00:31:31,492
And I always stay
at home all alone!

371
00:31:33,305 --> 00:31:36,900
It's a matter of some months.
I'll start my business in a year.

372
00:31:36,975 --> 00:31:37,771
My tours will stop then.

373
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:39,770
My planning is foolproof.

374
00:31:41,813 --> 00:31:42,404
Your planning!

375
00:31:43,782 --> 00:31:45,682
Your planning is
solely for yourself!

376
00:31:47,352 --> 00:31:52,289
Where's the place for
our home, our family?!

377
00:31:59,831 --> 00:32:01,890
Loneliness gnaws me!

378
00:32:06,271 --> 00:32:10,799
If we had a child, then I would
have endured everything!

379
00:32:11,977 --> 00:32:12,739
Even you not being around!

380
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:17,743
Aditi, I want to
stand on my feet.

381
00:32:19,551 --> 00:32:23,214
If we have a baby, it will be in
our house, not in a rented home

382
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:27,922
Fine. Even I'll
come with you then.

383
00:32:29,427 --> 00:32:31,418
Who will pay for
you? The company?

384
00:32:34,466 --> 00:32:36,900
All right, I'll bear
your expenses.

385
00:32:38,737 --> 00:32:40,671
But I'll be busy and will not be
able to give you time even there.

386
00:32:41,473 --> 00:32:42,337
You will be alone even there!

387
00:32:50,682 --> 00:32:51,614
May... may I take up a job?

388
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:56,580
Aditi, no woman in
our family has worked...

389
00:32:56,655 --> 00:32:58,247
...nor have we made her work

390
00:32:59,824 --> 00:33:02,793
I don't want my wife's money!
I can run my own house!

391
00:33:20,712 --> 00:33:25,513
I can empathise with your
loneliness, your gloominess...

392
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,479
Please be patient for
some months... for my sake!

393
00:33:34,993 --> 00:33:36,255
Why don't you
start singing again?

394
00:33:37,362 --> 00:33:38,329
You have a good voice...

395
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,657
...You've just stopped
singing after marriage!

396
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:41,763
Start your singing
sessions again.

397
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:44,958
You will pass your time
and feel good too. Okay?

398
00:33:46,938 --> 00:33:49,998
Aditi, look at me.

399
00:33:50,842 --> 00:33:52,673
And please smile just once.

400
00:33:53,578 --> 00:33:54,909
Dad, the people who
were to discuss...

401
00:33:54,979 --> 00:33:55,946
...the cement project are here.

402
00:33:59,651 --> 00:34:00,879
But your presence is crucial.

403
00:34:11,896 --> 00:34:13,454
"I returned from
Singapore today."

404
00:34:14,265 --> 00:34:19,532
"I met Aditi's music teacher,
Malhar Kamat, at home."

405
00:34:20,905 --> 00:34:21,803
"He seemed a nice man."

406
00:34:23,308 --> 00:34:25,299
'Franklyn speaking, I was 
preoccupied with some other worry.'

407
00:34:26,378 --> 00:34:28,209
"I have to go to
Nigeria the next day...

408
00:34:29,514 --> 00:34:32,210
...for some urgent supervision.'

409
00:34:33,284 --> 00:34:34,581
"I know, Aditi will move...

410
00:34:35,053 --> 00:34:37,920
...heaven and earth when
she learns about this."

411
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,450
"But..."

412
00:34:44,062 --> 00:34:46,257
Aditi, I have decided
to quit my job!

413
00:34:47,065 --> 00:34:48,760
No one cares about the
man who slogs hard!

414
00:34:49,734 --> 00:34:51,827
Will I keep working like a dog,
day and night, for the company?!

415
00:34:53,972 --> 00:34:55,371
Shreekant Pandit is efficient...

416
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,532
...He is earning profits
for the company!

417
00:34:56,608 --> 00:34:57,700
So, squeeze out as much work
as you can, from him!

418
00:34:58,676 --> 00:35:01,338
They don't understand
that I am married!

419
00:35:01,413 --> 00:35:02,710
That I have a wife
who feels lonely.

420
00:35:03,248 --> 00:35:04,476
I don't meet her
for months together!

421
00:35:04,983 --> 00:35:07,713
And now they want me to leave
for Nigeria tomorrow itself!

422
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:15,189
Have you packed for tomorrow?

423
00:35:19,664 --> 00:35:20,858
Yes.

424
00:35:21,399 --> 00:35:24,334
I promise I won't
step out of the...

425
00:35:24,903 --> 00:35:27,235
...house for 3 months
after returning.

426
00:35:27,806 --> 00:35:30,639
If you do, then I will leave this
house! I'll divorce u, Shree!

427
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:32,868
I swear by you, I
won't go anywhere.

428
00:35:34,746 --> 00:35:36,441
Why do you
always falsely swear?!

429
00:35:37,482 --> 00:35:40,815
Fine! Then I swear by myself,
by Vithal, by Patwardhan's dog...

430
00:35:40,885 --> 00:35:44,252
That's enough! You will
return by July 21, won't you?

431
00:35:46,324 --> 00:35:47,484
Why?

432
00:35:49,527 --> 00:35:51,256
It's our wedding day, Shree!

433
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:55,424
Of course, Aditi! How
can I forget that?

434
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,593
Well, you just did, darling!
...Here, have the milk.

435
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:58,961
I'll change and come.

436
00:36:43,281 --> 00:36:45,875
Please, Aditi. Not today.

437
00:36:47,418 --> 00:36:48,908
I'm very tired, and I've also...

438
00:36:49,787 --> 00:36:51,379
...got to leave early
in the morning.

439
00:37:01,966 --> 00:37:04,161
Wake me up at 5.30 a.m.

440
00:37:21,252 --> 00:37:22,219
Sir, there was a call from home.

441
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:24,378
Give it.

442
00:37:28,259 --> 00:37:28,850
What's it?

443
00:37:29,761 --> 00:37:31,285
I phoned to ask if
you'd eaten or not.

444
00:37:32,997 --> 00:37:34,464
I...

445
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:36,261
"I forgot, as I was busy...

446
00:37:36,334 --> 00:37:36,823
..." This is what you were
going to say, right?

447
00:37:37,402 --> 00:37:38,198
I've eaten.

448
00:37:38,503 --> 00:37:40,232
Really? What?

449
00:37:42,006 --> 00:37:43,200
I'll phone you later! Bye!

450
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,380
"I tried to reach home early on
the day of our anniversary."

451
00:37:52,817 --> 00:37:53,784
"But I did get late."

452
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:56,853
"I reached home, with
a new found joy."

453
00:37:57,655 --> 00:38:00,749
"Joy at having got an
independent contract in Nigeria."

454
00:38:01,626 --> 00:38:04,288
'For my own company.'

455
00:38:07,832 --> 00:38:10,824
"My wedding anniversary
was a new beginning."

456
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:16,666
"When I reached home, Aditi
was very gloomy, as usual."

457
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:24,648
Madam, sir's here.

458
00:38:38,262 --> 00:38:42,221
I have committed a grave crime,
for which there is no punishment.

459
00:38:45,703 --> 00:38:47,568
Yet, if you want to, then I'm
prepared to face any sentence.

460
00:38:49,407 --> 00:38:50,601
Hang me in the gallows...

461
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:52,340
...have me trampled under
an elephant's foot!

462
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,971
Feed me to the lion!
Burn me alive!

463
00:38:56,447 --> 00:38:57,914
But please forgive me.

464
00:39:14,499 --> 00:39:16,194
I'll tell you the truth
about why I was delayed.

465
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:20,429
Look at this. It's my
company's first contract.

466
00:39:44,595 --> 00:39:45,584
Come on, Aditi, pack our bags!

467
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:48,557
We'll go to Khandala
for a couple of days.

468
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:50,591
We have not gone out anywhere.

469
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:57,373
And only I'm
to be blamed for it.

470
00:39:58,309 --> 00:39:59,799
But that won't be
the case anymore.

471
00:40:07,285 --> 00:40:11,381
I'll make time
for you every month.

472
00:40:12,423 --> 00:40:13,253
I swear by you.

473
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:29,972
"After we returned from
Khandala, Aditi fell ill."

474
00:40:31,342 --> 00:40:33,708
She was feeling
giddy and nauseous.

475
00:40:34,812 --> 00:40:36,609
"That's why, even I
couldn't go to office."

476
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:51,454
Take it easy... Are
you all right?

477
00:40:53,364 --> 00:40:53,693
Sit.

478
00:40:55,366 --> 00:40:56,856
I'll call Ravi. Let him
check you once.

479
00:40:56,934 --> 00:40:59,027
Don't. I'm having
Dr. Joshi's medicines.

480
00:40:59,637 --> 00:41:02,299
Ravi is a specialist,
not just a doctor!

481
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:04,768
I'll be fine in some
days. Don't get so tensed.

482
00:41:06,277 --> 00:41:07,244
Did you eat something improper?

483
00:41:08,346 --> 00:41:09,608
No. I ate what you did.

484
00:41:10,815 --> 00:41:11,543
Then, what's wrong?!

485
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,216
Nothing! When my periods get
delayed, I suffer from acidity.

486
00:41:16,554 --> 00:41:18,749
I was supposed to get them
yesterday but I still haven't.

487
00:41:19,657 --> 00:41:20,521
Don't get so worried.

488
00:41:20,892 --> 00:41:22,689
Have a cigarette.
Please! Come on!

489
00:41:31,335 --> 00:41:33,269
"I've seen a plot for
our bungalow today."

490
00:41:34,405 --> 00:41:35,269
"I liked it very much."

491
00:41:36,507 --> 00:41:38,941
"I'll buy it soon."

492
00:41:40,645 --> 00:41:42,272
"It was a special day today."

493
00:41:43,614 --> 00:41:45,639
"I've even acquired
a big contract."

494
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:49,679
"I reached home to
give this good news."

495
00:42:07,872 --> 00:42:08,702
What's wrong?

496
00:42:12,476 --> 00:42:13,500
Tell me!

497
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,223
Aditi, I have signed my
life's biggest contract today.

498
00:42:34,332 --> 00:42:36,596
I have even see a plot
for our bungalow today.

499
00:42:37,702 --> 00:42:38,634
And now, this news!

500
00:42:46,077 --> 00:42:48,637
Shree, I want to
tell you something.

501
00:42:48,713 --> 00:42:49,509
I don't want to hear a thing.

502
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,605
- Please hear me out!
- I love you, Aditi!

503
00:42:51,682 --> 00:42:53,274
Shree, I've made
a grave mistake.

504
00:43:48,506 --> 00:43:51,566
Hey! You're back early today?

505
00:43:54,312 --> 00:43:58,908
Are you feeling fine, Shree?

506
00:44:02,787 --> 00:44:04,618
Aditi, please come
to the bedroom.

507
00:44:27,478 --> 00:44:27,807
Sit.

508
00:44:38,489 --> 00:44:39,683
Aniket was born...

509
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:42,721
...on April 3, 1974.

510
00:44:45,429 --> 00:44:47,363
Yes. But why are
you telling me this?

511
00:45:00,878 --> 00:45:05,781
I'd spoken to you about going to
Singapore on April 27, 1973.

512
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:10,776
On the same day, I had also
advised you to learn music.

513
00:45:14,992 --> 00:45:17,483
On May 5, 1973, I
left for Singapore.

514
00:45:19,997 --> 00:45:22,192
And returned on June 19, 1973.

515
00:45:23,534 --> 00:45:24,432
A month and a half later.

516
00:45:26,971 --> 00:45:31,465
I met Malhar Kamat the
same day at our home.

517
00:45:34,678 --> 00:45:41,413
The very next day, on
June 20, I left for Nigeria.

518
00:45:43,821 --> 00:45:45,448
And returned a
month later, on July 22.

519
00:45:48,492 --> 00:45:50,687
Our wedding
anniversary is on July 21.

520
00:45:54,598 --> 00:45:55,963
I couldn't make it on that day.

521
00:45:57,334 --> 00:46:01,361
So, in order to pacify you, we
left for Khandala on July 23.

522
00:46:02,807 --> 00:46:04,365
And returned on July 26.

523
00:46:06,544 --> 00:46:08,569
You started vomiting
the very next day.

524
00:46:10,314 --> 00:46:13,215
You told me then that your
periods had been delayed.

525
00:46:15,886 --> 00:46:18,719
You even told me that
they were due on July 25.

526
00:46:22,493 --> 00:46:28,591
On August 1, 1973, you told me
that you were pregnant

527
00:46:30,768 --> 00:46:33,601
And on April 3,
1974, Aniket was born.

528
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:39,901
After 8 months.

529
00:46:44,048 --> 00:46:45,743
Aniket was not a premature baby.

530
00:46:49,286 --> 00:46:56,283
I have noted all these
dates in my diary.

531
00:46:58,462 --> 00:46:59,793
So, every incident is
very clear in my mind.

532
00:47:04,502 --> 00:47:06,868
Then, Aditi, why is
Aniket's date of birth...

533
00:47:08,272 --> 00:47:10,900
...not consistent
with the other dates?

534
00:47:12,243 --> 00:47:13,767
Could you tell me
about the inconsistency?

535
00:47:17,248 --> 00:47:19,478
Why is there a discrepancy?

536
00:47:56,554 --> 00:47:57,316
Aniket...

537
00:48:01,258 --> 00:48:02,350
...is Malhar Kamat's son.

538
00:49:34,718 --> 00:49:35,742
Shree, will you tell us...

539
00:49:37,621 --> 00:49:40,590
...why you've summoned us
from Goa so urgently?

540
00:49:45,963 --> 00:49:48,363
Ravi, Aditi will answer that.

541
00:49:58,409 --> 00:50:01,242
Shree, why are you doing this?

542
00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:06,412
Why are you creating a
spectacle before everyone?

543
00:50:10,321 --> 00:50:13,722
This is a personal matter.

544
00:50:22,366 --> 00:50:23,924
Ravi is an old friend of mine.

545
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:32,838
It's important that
he stays here.

546
00:50:36,647 --> 00:50:38,342
And even more
important is that...

547
00:50:41,318 --> 00:50:45,778
...everybody should
know the truth!

548
00:50:48,792 --> 00:50:54,628
I don't want people to
accuse only me in the future.

549
00:51:09,413 --> 00:51:10,505
Please go out.

550
00:51:11,615 --> 00:51:12,673
Aniket will stay right here.

551
00:51:14,752 --> 00:51:15,582
He has the maturity
to understand...

552
00:51:16,353 --> 00:51:17,945
...what he's going to hear now.

553
00:51:18,021 --> 00:51:19,955
Dad, will you please tell
me what's going on?

554
00:51:40,043 --> 00:51:42,341
Shree, what is this!

555
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,545
Why don't you clearly
come to the point?

556
00:51:48,952 --> 00:51:49,941
Do you know Malhar Kamat?

557
00:51:56,527 --> 00:51:56,856
The same...

558
00:52:00,464 --> 00:52:01,829
The same generous man...

559
00:52:05,602 --> 00:52:09,595
...who assigned his inheritance
in Aditi's name.

560
00:52:10,974 --> 00:52:12,339
The same Malhar Kamat.

561
00:52:12,643 --> 00:52:17,239
Fine. But what's he got to do
with you summoning us here?

562
00:52:40,437 --> 00:52:41,836
Malhar Kamat is Aniket's father.

563
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,444
Why did this happen.

564
00:52:59,556 --> 00:53:03,287
How... and when.

565
00:53:06,029 --> 00:53:07,587
I want to hear
Aditi answer all this.

566
00:53:12,436 --> 00:53:13,562
And in front of all of you.

567
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,534
This is a personal matter.

568
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:21,578
You may privately listen to
what your wife has to say.

569
00:53:22,312 --> 00:53:23,870
There's no need to create
a scene before everyone.

570
00:53:26,517 --> 00:53:28,917
Anyway, I'm least
interested in staying back.

571
00:53:29,286 --> 00:53:33,916
Wait, Meghna.
For my sake, please!

572
00:53:47,804 --> 00:53:51,001
It was a few days
after you left for Nigeria.

573
00:53:53,877 --> 00:53:56,311
My sister, Sudha, and
her husband, Amar...

574
00:53:58,782 --> 00:54:00,181
...had come to Pune from Mumbai.

575
00:54:05,455 --> 00:54:07,184
So, what brings you
to Pune suddenly?

576
00:54:07,524 --> 00:54:08,957
We have to go to Jezuri.

577
00:54:11,695 --> 00:54:13,925
- And Rahul? - He's with
my mother-in-law.

578
00:54:14,298 --> 00:54:15,595
He stays mostly with her.

579
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:16,724
We stand to benefit with that!

580
00:54:17,734 --> 00:54:20,362
Amar! You're the father
of a 3 year old child!

581
00:54:20,771 --> 00:54:22,238
So behave a bit like
a responsible man!

582
00:54:22,573 --> 00:54:25,406
First, try and look like a
mother of three children!

583
00:54:27,044 --> 00:54:29,308
Of course, my wife looks
attractive. And I like that.

584
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,207
But you want to make me
an old man... I don't like that!

585
00:54:33,617 --> 00:54:36,814
Stop it! Let us talk! We've
met after so many years!

586
00:54:36,887 --> 00:54:38,946
Go ahead, talk!
I'll sit here quietly!

587
00:54:39,022 --> 00:54:40,649
Amar! Go for a stroll!

588
00:54:41,024 --> 00:54:42,787
Really? Will you come along too?

589
00:54:43,527 --> 00:54:43,959
Shall I go?!

590
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:47,788
I'll go and freshen up.

591
00:54:51,802 --> 00:54:54,270
He's mad! He harasses
me all the time!

592
00:54:54,871 --> 00:54:56,236
He always wants to
remain glued to my side!

593
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,339
I hope your Shree is not so mad!

594
00:55:01,244 --> 00:55:02,677
Shree is hardly here, to
indulge in such madness.

595
00:55:02,746 --> 00:55:07,410
There's just one solution to
this - have a baby soon!

596
00:55:10,687 --> 00:55:11,847
Shree wants to
indulge in planning.

597
00:55:12,589 --> 00:55:16,218
You've not had even one
baby, and you're into planning!

598
00:55:16,727 --> 00:55:17,455
But look at my mad man!

599
00:55:17,794 --> 00:55:19,227
He's been demanding
for another baby...

600
00:55:19,296 --> 00:55:20,320
...since the time Rahul
turned two!

601
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:26,269
Did you see? He doesn't leave
me alone for a minute!

602
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:28,862
Coming! I'll be
back in a while.

603
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:36,272
Why did you call me? Let me
sit with my sister for some time!

604
00:55:36,346 --> 00:55:39,713
Go ahead! But I'm going out,
I don't know when I'll return!

605
00:55:40,484 --> 00:55:43,817
I thought, before I
leave, let me K-l-S-S you.

606
00:55:43,887 --> 00:55:44,751
You're...!

607
00:56:11,782 --> 00:56:13,181
They stayed here for 2-3 days.

608
00:56:14,384 --> 00:56:15,510
Their affection...

609
00:56:15,986 --> 00:56:18,477
...them not giving a damn
about others and coming close

610
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:21,357
I was watching it all.

611
00:56:22,626 --> 00:56:24,218
Restless and alone.

612
00:56:25,395 --> 00:56:32,233
The next morning after they
left, I was practising singing.

613
00:56:33,704 --> 00:56:36,195
With Malhar.

614
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:10,502
What's wrong?

615
00:57:11,508 --> 00:57:12,736
- My foot! - Just a minute.

616
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:15,505
Show me your foot.

617
00:57:30,026 --> 00:57:30,958
How does it feel now?

618
00:57:36,399 --> 00:57:37,388
Don't stop, Shree.

619
00:57:51,481 --> 00:57:55,815
I strongly felt the
need for him then.

620
00:57:58,755 --> 00:58:00,450
My singing lessons
continued but...

621
00:58:02,659 --> 00:58:04,786
I was not
concentrating on music.

622
00:58:07,564 --> 00:58:09,191
I became very restless.

623
00:58:11,601 --> 00:58:16,698
Perhaps Malhar sensed my
restlessness and loneliness.

624
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:22,171
He started becoming a bit
too sympathetic towards me.

625
00:58:25,015 --> 00:58:29,816
During our music lessons, we
began brushing each other lightly

626
00:58:31,288 --> 00:58:31,913
And I don't know why...

627
00:58:31,988 --> 00:58:33,455
...even I didn't feel the
need to curb them.

628
00:58:36,359 --> 00:58:37,621
One day, I was
playing the harmonium.

629
00:58:38,328 --> 00:58:43,664
He was singing. My
concentration was nil.

630
00:58:45,735 --> 00:58:51,799
Perhaps he realised
that, and sat behind me.

631
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:54,800
He put his hands
over my shoulders...

632
00:58:54,878 --> 00:58:56,470
...and began teaching
me the tune.

633
00:58:58,648 --> 00:59:00,206
He did so, for the first time.

634
00:59:02,586 --> 00:59:04,178
I sure was surprised
at his guts but...

635
00:59:08,758 --> 00:59:10,225
Perhaps it was what I
was searching for.

636
00:59:14,698 --> 00:59:17,462
And it seemed as if he was
reading everything written on it.

637
00:59:18,668 --> 00:59:24,698
My face was like an open
book at that moment.

638
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:29,244
My music lessons went on.

639
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:35,775
And Malhar also
continued to come home.

640
00:59:37,387 --> 00:59:40,914
After the lessons,
he would go away.

641
00:59:42,259 --> 00:59:43,317
But once he was gone...

642
00:59:43,393 --> 00:59:45,224
...the thoughts arising in my
heart would make me feel ashamed.

643
00:59:47,297 --> 00:59:49,731
'Malhar, don't come
from tomorrow.'

644
00:59:50,834 --> 00:59:53,701
I would decide to
say so, everyday.

645
00:59:55,672 --> 01:00:00,769
But I'd also eagerly wait
for him to come home.

646
01:00:02,779 --> 01:00:04,940
I didn't want my face
to reveal my feelings.

647
01:00:05,882 --> 01:00:07,747
Fearing this, I would
send Vithal...

648
01:00:08,952 --> 01:00:10,647
...out everyday, under
some pretext.

649
01:00:12,689 --> 01:00:14,486
Malhar came that day.

650
01:00:15,659 --> 01:00:17,889
With a composition
of his new song.

651
01:00:19,529 --> 01:00:23,556
He was very eager
to sing it for me.

652
01:00:55,799 --> 01:01:05,538
Come with me! Come with me!

653
01:01:32,702 --> 01:01:42,475
Without you every
moment is lonely

654
01:01:44,347 --> 01:01:53,415
Oh my love, oh my love

655
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:59,258
Come with me! Come with me!

656
01:02:36,933 --> 01:02:47,639
I have a desire in my heart
to see you to my satisfaction

657
01:02:48,078 --> 01:02:59,285
Let me close my eyes and lose
myself in your dreams

658
01:02:59,355 --> 01:03:10,823
Every moment let me
swing in the music of love

659
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:18,864
Oh my love, oh my love

660
01:03:19,642 --> 01:03:29,813
Come with me! Come with me!

661
01:04:08,992 --> 01:04:19,596
Your cheeks are fragment
from the stolen flowers

662
01:04:20,637 --> 01:04:31,946
Wind has drunk the honey
from your two lips

663
01:04:32,282 --> 01:04:42,681
My love! Your dress
has nice fragrance

664
01:04:51,834 --> 01:05:01,709
Come with me! Come with me!

665
01:05:02,812 --> 01:05:12,687
Oh my love, oh my love

666
01:07:00,897 --> 01:07:08,201
That was a lone
moment of weakness!

667
01:07:10,006 --> 01:07:11,337
And I lost it all.

668
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:24,917
I even thought of
committing suicide.

669
01:07:26,422 --> 01:07:28,413
But I lacked the guts.

670
01:07:30,026 --> 01:07:34,861
I didn't want
Shree to go through...

671
01:07:34,931 --> 01:07:40,870
...the trouble of
answering the world!

672
01:07:46,642 --> 01:07:50,305
The next day,
Malhar came home again.

673
01:07:51,481 --> 01:07:53,813
I have decided to stop
the music lessons.

674
01:07:56,786 --> 01:07:59,482
It'd be better if you stop
coming here from tomorrow.

675
01:08:02,225 --> 01:08:03,715
Please don't say that, Aditi.

676
01:08:04,594 --> 01:08:07,654
Everything that happened yesterday
has cast a permanent impression on

677
01:08:08,498 --> 01:08:13,492
That experience has become a
part of my body, my soul.

678
01:08:16,406 --> 01:08:17,839
Please don't keep me
away from you.

679
01:08:19,409 --> 01:08:20,171
I...

680
01:08:29,552 --> 01:08:36,617
It was only a transient moment.
Body had taken control over the mind.

681
01:08:38,594 --> 01:08:41,529
I'm not blaming you,
and I won't.

682
01:08:42,832 --> 01:08:50,796
Yesterday, the body present was
yours but... the face was Shree's.

683
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:59,214
Please go away from
my life forever.

684
01:09:06,289 --> 01:09:09,258
You returned from Nigeria, joyous
you had acquired a new contract.

685
01:09:10,526 --> 01:09:12,790
But I was feeling miserable
and depressed.

686
01:09:14,263 --> 01:09:16,322
You thought I was upset because you
couldn't make it for our

687
01:09:17,333 --> 01:09:18,561
However, the reason
was different.

688
01:09:18,968 --> 01:09:20,902
I wanted to tell you frankly about
everything that had transpired

689
01:09:22,371 --> 01:09:25,397
I even knew that
it would hurt you.

690
01:09:26,342 --> 01:09:32,281
In order to pacify me,
you took me to Khandala.

691
01:09:33,883 --> 01:09:37,614
The burden in my heart
eased in those settings.

692
01:09:39,589 --> 01:09:43,923
I decided to forget the past
and start life afresh.

693
01:09:46,028 --> 01:09:48,826
But fate had decided,
otherwise.

694
01:09:51,834 --> 01:09:56,294
I returned from Khandala,
and I missed my period.

695
01:09:58,641 --> 01:09:59,903
When I went to the doctor...

696
01:10:01,477 --> 01:10:04,537
...my pregnancy was confirmed.

697
01:10:07,984 --> 01:10:10,817
I called Sudha.

698
01:10:11,287 --> 01:10:14,814
Aditi, you will end up
destroying two lives!

699
01:10:17,393 --> 01:10:20,794
Terminate this pregnancy right now,
without telling a word to anybody.

700
01:10:21,664 --> 01:10:22,392
No, Sudha.

701
01:10:23,699 --> 01:10:26,293
I cannot deceive Shree.

702
01:10:26,669 --> 01:10:29,001
I know Shree very well.
He will never forgive you!

703
01:10:30,907 --> 01:10:33,398
No problem. I'll endure that.

704
01:10:34,443 --> 01:10:37,412
- I will have to endure that.
- Please don't do that!

705
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:38,242
No, Sudha.

706
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:49,553
If anything goes wrong,
then just call me.

707
01:10:50,927 --> 01:10:51,859
I'm here for you.

708
01:10:57,533 --> 01:11:00,468
That day, you came home
and looked very happy.

709
01:11:03,573 --> 01:11:05,268
You had acquired
a new contract.

710
01:11:06,876 --> 01:11:10,209
And you had even seen
the plot for this bungalow.

711
01:11:11,781 --> 01:11:15,774
You saw me and asked...

712
01:11:17,286 --> 01:11:18,548
What's wrong?

713
01:11:24,293 --> 01:11:24,850
What's wrong?

714
01:11:27,029 --> 01:11:27,927
Tell me!

715
01:11:38,874 --> 01:11:43,368
Aditi, I have signed my life's
biggest contract today.

716
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:46,810
I have even seen a plot
for our bungalow today.

717
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:49,340
And now, this news!

718
01:11:57,627 --> 01:11:59,356
Shree, I want to tell
you something

719
01:12:07,503 --> 01:12:09,971
Shree, I have made
a grave mistake!

720
01:12:10,039 --> 01:12:11,666
To hell with your mistake
and our planning!

721
01:12:11,741 --> 01:12:13,265
I'm going to be a father, Aditi!

722
01:12:13,342 --> 01:12:19,542
Vithal, I'm going
to be a father!

723
01:12:19,615 --> 01:12:20,309
I'll phone Ravi!

724
01:12:27,623 --> 01:12:29,215
Pick it up!

725
01:12:29,859 --> 01:12:32,225
Uncle! I'm going to be a father!

726
01:12:36,332 --> 01:12:37,629
- Give the phone to Ravi, please.
- Okay, sir.

727
01:12:38,868 --> 01:12:41,268
Hello, who's speaking?

728
01:12:54,617 --> 01:12:55,743
Fantastic! When did you find out?!

729
01:12:55,818 --> 01:12:57,513
Aditi told me about it just now.

730
01:13:03,726 --> 01:13:12,600
You were so happy that you didn't
even doubt the baby was not yours.

731
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:19,707
Seeing you so elated,
I couldn't muster...

732
01:13:19,775 --> 01:13:22,710
...the courage to tell
you the truth

733
01:13:25,748 --> 01:13:26,908
I knew you would break down.

734
01:13:28,584 --> 01:13:30,381
You would not be able to
bear the truth.

735
01:13:32,288 --> 01:13:34,256
Did Malhar know that
Aniket was his son?

736
01:13:42,031 --> 01:13:46,559
A few days after
Aniket was born...

737
01:13:48,938 --> 01:13:49,962
...he had come home.

738
01:13:50,606 --> 01:13:52,540
Sinha, the file of Radical
Electrons is in my office.

739
01:13:52,875 --> 01:13:54,775
Send it to the party in Singapore.

740
01:13:55,077 --> 01:13:56,510
If Shreenivasan doesn't agree...

741
01:13:57,913 --> 01:14:00,575
Welcome, Mr. Malhar Kamat!
Where have you been?

742
01:14:00,649 --> 01:14:02,640
I had some work in my village.
I stay there nowadays.

743
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:13,622
That's why I'm here. I met Vithal
in the market, and he told me.

744
01:14:16,298 --> 01:14:18,698
- Is Aditi... - She's inside.
I'll join you later

745
01:14:19,802 --> 01:14:24,705
Sinha, tell Shreenivasan, if there's a
family problem, I'll give a notice

746
01:14:51,567 --> 01:14:52,295
You?

747
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:55,628
Why have you come here?

748
01:14:57,039 --> 01:14:58,768
To congratulate both of you.

749
01:15:00,009 --> 01:15:01,567
And to see the baby.

750
01:15:12,321 --> 01:15:13,652
Aditi, this is how
I looked in my childhood.

751
01:15:15,024 --> 01:15:20,485
The same nose, eyes, lips...

752
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:22,590
Exactly this way.

753
01:15:25,301 --> 01:15:26,359
This is not your baby.

754
01:15:33,342 --> 01:15:36,607
I know, Aditi... I do.

755
01:15:39,582 --> 01:15:40,742
But don't worry...

756
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,379
...This secret will always
remained buried in my heart.

757
01:15:46,789 --> 01:15:48,586
And will leave
with me when I die.

758
01:15:49,325 --> 01:15:54,388
I desired to see
my child just once.

759
01:15:56,365 --> 01:16:01,166
After this, I will never
ever enter your life.

760
01:16:55,324 --> 01:16:58,782
Shree, forgive me. Please!

761
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:06,399
I swear I didn't do
anything intentionally.

762
01:18:04,994 --> 01:18:06,586
Ravi, now tell me, what
am I supposed to do?

763
01:18:14,603 --> 01:18:15,661
Look, Shreekant...

764
01:18:17,806 --> 01:18:19,831
I consider you to be
a very close friend.

765
01:18:21,844 --> 01:18:24,836
And in all this time, I
have noticed one thing.

766
01:18:26,448 --> 01:18:29,576
Aditi's abundant love for you.

767
01:18:32,855 --> 01:18:35,790
You and your family were
her world, and they still are

768
01:18:37,493 --> 01:18:39,757
And what she just mentioned,
is only a human folly.

769
01:18:41,730 --> 01:18:44,927
Any other woman in her
place would have done the same.

770
01:18:45,834 --> 01:18:46,766
Perhaps even me.

771
01:18:48,670 --> 01:18:55,371
However, she has
been very truthful

772
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:01,344
Shreekant, you are a
sensible and mature person.

773
01:19:03,752 --> 01:19:06,277
Whatever happened was an
incident of the distant past.

774
01:19:08,524 --> 01:19:11,220
Even time does not wish
to remember that episode.

775
01:19:11,994 --> 01:19:15,293
Put the past behind you and
accept the circumstance.

776
01:19:19,768 --> 01:19:22,737
If you were in my place,
would you have accepted it?

777
01:19:23,272 --> 01:19:26,935
I have accepted Meghna along
with her two daughters!

778
01:19:27,476 --> 01:19:30,673
Ravi! You knew everything
about her past...

779
01:19:30,746 --> 01:19:32,577
...before you got married to her!

780
01:19:33,982 --> 01:19:35,779
You knew everything,
and married her!

781
01:19:38,554 --> 01:19:40,545
If this were to happen
to you, would you...?

782
01:19:40,622 --> 01:19:43,614
Yet! Yet, I would accept her!

783
01:19:45,027 --> 01:19:48,554
And after listening
to Aditi... definitely!

784
01:19:53,702 --> 01:19:55,329
Then, Ravi, you are a
very broad-minded man!

785
01:19:57,606 --> 01:20:00,234
Unfortunately, I am not.

786
01:20:00,676 --> 01:20:03,736
I can never forgive Aditi.

787
01:20:08,484 --> 01:20:12,511
If this is your stand, then even
you have not been loyal!

788
01:20:13,622 --> 01:20:14,520
Remember, some years back...

789
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:16,524
...you had spoken about
your affairs to me?!

790
01:20:16,592 --> 01:20:16,887
Remember?

791
01:20:19,328 --> 01:20:20,522
They lasted only a few days...

792
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:25,792
...And even if I were
to have a child...

793
01:20:25,868 --> 01:20:27,495
...I wouldn't have
brought him home!

794
01:20:33,675 --> 01:20:34,972
I won't wait here
for a minute more

795
01:20:37,045 --> 01:20:37,909
Let's go, Aditi.

796
01:20:59,434 --> 01:21:00,298
Leave me, Shree.

797
01:21:22,791 --> 01:21:24,418
After causing me
such endless pain...

798
01:21:25,794 --> 01:21:29,321
...do you think you will
be set free so easily?

799
01:21:32,768 --> 01:21:35,328
So that people
can say I left you...

800
01:21:35,904 --> 01:21:38,395
...because Aniket was not my son

801
01:21:41,677 --> 01:21:42,939
You will be free, Aditi.

802
01:21:45,314 --> 01:21:49,774
But people will say, "Look!
There goes the impotent man!"

803
01:21:50,919 --> 01:21:53,319
"Who raised another man's
child for 25 years...

804
01:21:53,822 --> 01:21:56,985
...believing it to be his."

805
01:21:59,328 --> 01:21:59,851
No way, Aditi.

806
01:22:01,997 --> 01:22:03,464
I won't let go of you so easily.

807
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:06,197
This is your punishment.

808
01:22:07,402 --> 01:22:08,892
You will remain in this
house all your life.

809
01:22:12,841 --> 01:22:17,278
With your husband... who will
have nothing to do with you

810
01:22:19,815 --> 01:22:25,378
And with your son... whom I
will never consider my own.

811
01:22:39,801 --> 01:22:42,793
- What are you doing? - Packing!
I can't stay here anymore

812
01:22:45,307 --> 01:22:46,934
But, Meghna, how can we
leave Aditi in this state?

813
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:50,005
Ravi, I'm only leaving
this house, not the city.

814
01:22:50,345 --> 01:22:52,870
I will not leave Pune until
Aditi's problem gets solved.

815
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:56,983
What a disgusting man
Shreekant Pandit is!

816
01:22:57,853 --> 01:23:00,447
I feel he's a disgrace
to the race of men!

817
01:23:01,657 --> 01:23:04,683
I'd recognised him instantly,
and I had even told you.

818
01:23:05,027 --> 01:23:06,460
I was absolutely correct.

819
01:23:06,828 --> 01:23:08,853
Therefore, his behaviour
didn't take me by surprise.

820
01:23:10,499 --> 01:23:12,296
But what distressed me
was Aniket's behaviour.

821
01:23:12,901 --> 01:23:13,959
He's belongs to
today's generation...

822
01:23:14,536 --> 01:23:16,197
...having the so-called
modern view

823
01:23:16,772 --> 01:23:18,467
At least, he should have
understood his mother.

824
01:23:19,408 --> 01:23:22,241
But he insulted her, and that
too, using such foul language!

825
01:23:26,048 --> 01:23:28,812
However, at least as of now, I
see no solution to this problem

826
01:24:59,007 --> 01:25:00,497
What's wrong,
Aniket? - Don't touch me!

827
01:25:02,444 --> 01:25:03,638
Don't say a word!

828
01:25:05,847 --> 01:25:08,680
You have ruined
me... destroyed me!

829
01:25:10,752 --> 01:25:12,379
Why didn't you
kill me at birth?!

830
01:25:14,523 --> 01:25:17,583
O' God! Why did I have to
be born to this woman?!

831
01:25:19,027 --> 01:25:20,494
I don't even want
to see your face!

832
01:25:31,139 --> 01:25:32,071
This is a home, not a bazaar!

833
01:25:34,342 --> 01:25:36,469
This woman has ruined my life!

834
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:40,912
Revati has called
off our engagement

835
01:25:46,488 --> 01:25:49,321
And you are responsible!

836
01:25:50,892 --> 01:25:53,360
And if you have any shame left...

837
01:25:53,762 --> 01:25:55,389
...the go and blacken your
face somewhere!

838
01:26:09,711 --> 01:26:11,440
That's good!

839
01:26:12,981 --> 01:26:14,812
What I had feared, has happened.

840
01:26:17,519 --> 01:26:20,852
Revati knows about it today.
Tomorrow, whole world will. Know

841
01:26:22,891 --> 01:26:24,586
I will be mocked at, everywhere.

842
01:26:27,562 --> 01:26:28,620
Mr. Shreekant Pandit's honour...

843
01:26:28,697 --> 01:26:30,927
...will go down the drain
before the world!

844
01:26:39,407 --> 01:26:41,398
I will prepare the divorce
papers in some days.

845
01:26:44,646 --> 01:26:46,273
It makes no sense not
seeking a divorce now.

846
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:50,375
And yes! Don't bother
going to the court.

847
01:26:50,952 --> 01:26:52,749
I'll give you an alimony...

848
01:26:54,823 --> 01:26:56,950
...so you won't have to
worry about money.

849
01:27:00,495 --> 01:27:01,587
I don't want anything, Shree.

850
01:27:02,364 --> 01:27:03,331
Nothing?

851
01:27:05,033 --> 01:27:08,799
Oh yes! I'd forgotten.

852
01:27:11,039 --> 01:27:13,837
You don't need my money anymore.

853
01:27:15,944 --> 01:27:17,343
You're a rich woman!

854
01:27:20,148 --> 01:27:22,446
The sole inheritor
to Malhar Kamat!

855
01:27:26,721 --> 01:27:31,749
Whether I accept that money
or not, I won't bother you.

856
01:27:36,765 --> 01:27:37,493
All I ask for...

857
01:27:38,099 --> 01:27:40,363
...is your permission to let me
stay here for some days.

858
01:27:43,805 --> 01:27:45,966
Till I make another arrangement.

859
01:27:48,877 --> 01:27:52,745
I've tolerated you for 27 years.
I can bear for some more days

860
01:28:44,499 --> 01:28:51,428
Our love is unique

861
01:28:54,109 --> 01:29:01,777
Our love is unique

862
01:29:13,628 --> 01:29:23,026
When it is hot, you
give me shade

863
01:29:23,104 --> 01:29:32,877
When my feet gets burnt,
heal me with your touch

864
01:29:32,947 --> 01:29:39,978
Our love is unique

865
01:29:42,724 --> 01:29:49,926
Our love is unique

866
01:30:21,596 --> 01:30:30,868
I had my lovely
dreams on your arms

867
01:30:30,939 --> 01:30:40,280
Rays of hope were
received from your window

868
01:30:45,353 --> 01:30:55,524
I blossomed like a
flower in this flower

869
01:30:55,597 --> 01:31:05,302
I got all comforts after
entering this door-step

870
01:31:05,373 --> 01:31:12,006
Our love is unique

871
01:31:14,949 --> 01:31:21,718
Our love is unique

872
01:33:11,933 --> 01:33:15,494
A bond attached
with this house...

873
01:33:16,671 --> 01:33:19,538
...for 4 years will be
severed today.

874
01:33:22,744 --> 01:33:23,574
Really.

875
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:27,280
Just the way a baby is
separated from its mother...

876
01:33:29,017 --> 01:33:31,042
...by cutting off
the umbilical cord.

877
01:33:36,891 --> 01:33:39,325
Before I leave, I'd like
to tell you something.

878
01:33:39,827 --> 01:33:41,761
There's nothing left to say now.

879
01:33:44,032 --> 01:33:45,727
You have tolerated
me for 27 years.

880
01:33:46,401 --> 01:33:47,698
You might as well bear me
for a while more, Shree.

881
01:33:48,436 --> 01:33:51,303
You also wait,
Aniket. Don't leave.

882
01:33:54,542 --> 01:33:56,772
Whatever you say, will
have no effect on me!

883
01:33:57,545 --> 01:33:59,308
No way! Don't worry...

884
01:33:59,947 --> 01:34:03,439
...I won't say anything that
will make you stop me

885
01:34:04,886 --> 01:34:08,481
I only wish to speak of certain
things which I couldn't, earlier.

886
01:34:10,391 --> 01:34:12,484
Shree, a man may make merry with
as many women as he wants.

887
01:34:13,528 --> 01:34:17,862
But he expects complete
loyalty from his wife, right?

888
01:34:20,535 --> 01:34:23,936
Because of a weakness
manifested 25 years ago...

889
01:34:24,439 --> 01:34:27,067
...my home is broken today.

890
01:34:28,576 --> 01:34:29,634
It's so strange.

891
01:34:30,578 --> 01:34:34,981
What I term a weakness,
you call it immoral.

892
01:34:36,851 --> 01:34:37,943
Tell me something...

893
01:34:38,820 --> 01:34:41,288
...is the heart of a man
different from that of a woman

894
01:34:41,689 --> 01:34:43,953
o his desires vary
from that of a woman?!

895
01:34:45,893 --> 01:34:47,986
Do the flames of
physical desire that...

896
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:51,028
...engulf you, stoke me any less?

897
01:34:51,599 --> 01:34:55,535
And if I'm overwhelmed with this
desire, what am I supposed to do?

898
01:34:56,137 --> 01:35:03,737
Do I beg and implore before you?

899
01:35:04,679 --> 01:35:08,843
Or do I keep waiting, wondering
when you'll oblige me?

900
01:35:15,156 --> 01:35:17,021
Anyway, I don't
want the answers.

901
01:35:18,059 --> 01:35:19,492
As the answers lie in
the these very questions!

902
01:35:20,628 --> 01:35:22,755
But do these questions ever
come to your mind too, Shree?!

903
01:35:23,164 --> 01:35:27,100
Under a similar situation,
what does a man do?!

904
01:35:27,702 --> 01:35:28,896
He never implores
before a woman to...

905
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:30,767
...have his physical
needs satisfied

906
01:35:31,172 --> 01:35:33,333
Whether a woman gives
her consent or not...

907
01:35:33,975 --> 01:35:35,943
...he satisfies his desire!

908
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:41,573
In this manner, even you have
raped me many times, Shree.

909
01:35:44,952 --> 01:35:47,420
Before the union of two bodies, a
union of two minds is necessary.

910
01:35:48,356 --> 01:35:49,516
But you never understood this.

911
01:35:56,364 --> 01:35:58,889
After marriage, you'd go
out of station for your work.

912
01:36:00,001 --> 01:36:01,025
And I'd be at home, all alone.

913
01:36:01,836 --> 01:36:07,638
In that loneliness,
I lost my control.

914
01:36:08,409 --> 01:36:10,570
Which even you lost, sometimes.
Even you had affairs.

915
01:36:11,145 --> 01:36:13,670
Which you conveniently forgot.

916
01:36:14,382 --> 01:36:16,077
You have even forgiven yourself.

917
01:36:17,418 --> 01:36:20,945
Because you felt that, being
a man, it was your right!

918
01:36:21,989 --> 01:36:23,479
Who's given you this right?!

919
01:36:25,126 --> 01:36:27,617
Those women with
whom you slept?!

920
01:36:30,598 --> 01:36:33,396
Have you ever thought, what must
have happened to them later?!

921
01:36:35,803 --> 01:36:37,600
Your ego was bruised when you...

922
01:36:38,005 --> 01:36:40,405
...learnt that Aniket is
Malhar Kamat's son!

923
01:36:40,808 --> 01:36:42,571
Your pseudo, shallow ego!

924
01:36:43,444 --> 01:36:45,435
Even Malhar Kamat
was no different!

925
01:36:46,013 --> 01:36:50,848
It was his ego that made him
transfer his wealth to me, right?

926
01:36:52,887 --> 01:36:54,980
After all, I was the
mother of his child!

927
01:36:56,891 --> 01:36:58,290
And according to you...

928
01:36:58,693 --> 01:37:02,595
...only the power to procreate
is a sign of being a man

929
01:37:03,664 --> 01:37:05,894
Aren't people who don't
have children, men?!

930
01:37:08,569 --> 01:37:11,037
When you'd consider
Aniket to be your son...

931
01:37:11,973 --> 01:37:13,440
how proudly you'd claim it...

932
01:37:17,712 --> 01:37:21,478
And everything has changed in
just a day... a moment?!

933
01:37:21,849 --> 01:37:23,009
Everything, Shree?!

934
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:30,755
Do you have any proof that
Aniket is Malhar Kamat's son?!

935
01:37:32,894 --> 01:37:33,883
You don't!

936
01:37:34,595 --> 01:37:38,031
And even you know it today
only because I told you!

937
01:37:38,966 --> 01:37:40,627
Me - his mother!

938
01:37:42,336 --> 01:37:45,828
This is the only
relationship which is true.

939
01:37:47,441 --> 01:37:49,341
That of a mother and her child.

940
01:37:50,811 --> 01:37:54,042
Only a mother can say who
the child's father is, Shree.

941
01:37:56,117 --> 01:37:57,641
Only a mother can!

942
01:38:02,890 --> 01:38:03,618
And then...

943
01:38:06,894 --> 01:38:11,922
...if I hadn't succumbed to
my weakness 25 years ago...

944
01:38:13,367 --> 01:38:15,392
...I'd have been
accused differently.

945
01:38:16,671 --> 01:38:26,945
Of being infertile. Mind you,
I'd have been accused, not you!

946
01:38:28,783 --> 01:38:32,014
In spite of the truth that...

947
01:38:38,759 --> 01:38:42,820
...we never had any
children after Aniket

948
01:38:44,098 --> 01:38:46,566
Yet, you're the
only I have loved.

949
01:38:48,002 --> 01:38:52,029
And I would have loved only you.

950
01:38:53,674 --> 01:38:54,766
But today, you, this house...

951
01:38:56,410 --> 01:39:00,506
...and nothing here...
belong to me anymore

952
01:39:04,452 --> 01:39:08,582
Now... But today, I have no
regrets leaving behind all this.

953
01:39:15,629 --> 01:39:17,324
Mrs. Aditi Shreekant Pandit.

954
01:39:18,766 --> 01:39:21,667
Aditi had got lost
somewhere in this name.

955
01:39:23,537 --> 01:39:25,801
The open skies beckon her today.

956
01:39:26,974 --> 01:39:30,466
I'm eager to find my
...my individuality.

957
01:39:31,412 --> 01:39:34,540
Yes, there is a feeling of
restlessness but there's no fear.

958
01:39:37,551 --> 01:39:41,009
And I am very grateful
to you for this, Meghna.

959
01:39:43,324 --> 01:39:47,488
Remember, you had once told
me that I should do something?

960
01:39:50,898 --> 01:39:54,664
At this age, I feel I
have been born again.

961
01:40:00,908 --> 01:40:02,398
Aditi, come with me to Goa.

962
01:40:03,844 --> 01:40:06,472
No, Meghna. I'm
waiting for somebody.

963
01:40:07,048 --> 01:40:07,639
Who?

964
01:40:14,121 --> 01:40:18,524
I know, all of you must be
surprised to see me here.

965
01:40:20,861 --> 01:40:21,953
You must be wondering...

966
01:40:22,863 --> 01:40:25,889
...why I'm here, in spite of
knowing everything, right

967
01:40:29,103 --> 01:40:31,765
Well, I have come
to take away Aditi.

968
01:40:33,741 --> 01:40:37,370
Aniket, the incidents that
occurred in Aditi's life...

969
01:40:37,445 --> 01:40:39,310
...was not the reason why
I broke off our engagement.

970
01:40:40,381 --> 01:40:42,008
I called it off because the
men of this house...

971
01:40:42,083 --> 01:40:44,347
...didn't try to understand

972
01:40:45,453 --> 01:40:47,478
I don't think Aditi
has committed a sin.

973
01:40:48,422 --> 01:40:50,890
In fact, her honesty
and commitment...

974
01:40:50,958 --> 01:40:53,688
...didn't try to understand

975
01:40:55,930 --> 01:40:59,559
But your dad sorry, Mr. Shreekant
Pandit cannot understand this.

976
01:40:59,633 --> 01:41:02,602
His behaviour towards
Aditi was indeed improper.

977
01:41:03,938 --> 01:41:06,566
But yours was worse!

978
01:41:07,074 --> 01:41:08,939
A man with a narrow-minded...

979
01:41:09,009 --> 01:41:11,944
...attitude like yours will
not be my husband!

980
01:41:14,348 --> 01:41:15,940
I consider myself as belonging
to the new generation.

981
01:41:17,418 --> 01:41:20,683
Broad-minded and devoid
of any prejudices.

982
01:41:21,822 --> 01:41:23,551
And I had considered
you to be the same.

983
01:41:25,059 --> 01:41:28,495
I don't think I'm inferior
to men in any respect.

984
01:41:30,698 --> 01:41:31,858
So, in that regard...

985
01:41:31,932 --> 01:41:33,263
...what's considered wrong
for me as a woman...

986
01:41:33,834 --> 01:41:36,428
...should also be regarded
as improper for you.

987
01:41:37,571 --> 01:41:39,766
And being a man, what's
considered right for you...

988
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:41,473
...should be deemed
correct for me too...

989
01:41:41,542 --> 01:41:43,305
...in spite of being a woman.

990
01:41:45,946 --> 01:41:47,345
One last thing, Aniket.

991
01:41:48,349 --> 01:41:50,874
You say that by being immoral,
Aditi has slandered you.

992
01:41:51,418 --> 01:41:52,749
But you forget...

993
01:41:53,454 --> 01:41:57,015
...you are here today because
of her so-called immorality

994
01:41:59,627 --> 01:42:01,288
You have an individuality!

995
01:42:03,564 --> 01:42:04,826
And you will always have to be...

996
01:42:04,899 --> 01:42:06,526
...indebted to this
immoral lady for it

997
01:42:25,886 --> 01:42:26,875
Let's go? - Yes.

998
01:42:37,565 --> 01:42:38,361
Take care, Shree.

999
01:42:40,701 --> 01:42:41,326
All by yourself.

1000
01:42:42,469 --> 01:42:43,367
I'll leave.

1001
01:42:58,652 --> 01:43:05,023
I will never vanish
or die from here

1002
01:43:06,827 --> 01:43:13,357
I will never vanish
or die from here

1003
01:43:14,401 --> 01:43:19,771
I will have to
be alive here forever

1004
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:25,039
I will have to be
alive here forever

1005
01:43:25,813 --> 01:43:30,978
I will have to
be alive here forever

1006
01:43:36,657 --> 01:43:39,490
Till there is life

1007
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:42,051
Till the sky is present

1008
01:43:42,396 --> 01:43:44,921
Till the ocean and Sun are there

1009
01:43:44,999 --> 01:43:47,627
Till the winds blows

1010
01:43:53,374 --> 01:43:55,865
Till there is life

1011
01:43:55,943 --> 01:43:58,639
Till the sky is present

1012
01:43:58,712 --> 01:44:01,408
Till the ocean and Sun are there

1013
01:44:01,482 --> 01:44:04,076
Till the winds blows

1014
01:44:04,652 --> 01:44:14,926
Till then I will
also remain here

1015
01:44:15,496 --> 01:44:20,627
I will be alive here forever

1016
01:44:20,701 --> 01:44:25,968
will be alive here forever

1017
01:44:50,764 --> 01:44:56,066
I will have to be
alive here forever

1018
01:44:56,370 --> 01:45:01,364
I will have to be
alive here forever
