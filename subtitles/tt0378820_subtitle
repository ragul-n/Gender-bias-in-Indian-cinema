- The letters come on my address.

' I am reaching on Tuesday
evening at 4:30 pm.'

27
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:06,473
You'd said you'll get
holiday after six months.

28
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:08,682
Then why did you
take so long to come?

29
00:03:09,678 --> 00:03:13,364
I'd said six months.
But I am back in three months.

30
00:03:13,831 --> 00:03:16,751
Three months? Yes.

31
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:20,019
You are not at fault.

32
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:26,108
Honesty, even I have missed you
as much in the past three months.

33
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:28,298
Yes, Rajjo.

34
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:44,672
The luggage is Jitu's
but where did he go?

35
00:03:47,947 --> 00:03:49,247
Oh my God, father.

36
00:03:56,954 --> 00:04:04,954
I was fed up of seeing you
face all day. Now that my son..

37
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:14,658
Where are you going?

38
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:17,587
To meet aunty.

39
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,506
- To meet aunt?
- Yes.

40
00:04:20,723 --> 00:04:23,542
When I had left,
aunt had bad cough.

41
00:04:23,877 --> 00:04:26,196
That was three months ago.

42
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:32,081
Yes, yes so what?
Go meet her and come.

43
00:05:16,814 --> 00:05:18,335
What are you doing?

44
00:05:18,455 --> 00:05:19,900
Who is it?

45
00:05:21,284 --> 00:05:22,719

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,858
- Jitu, come inside.
- Coming.

47
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,770
- Aunt!
- Were you doing fine?

48
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,036
- Yes.
- Your duty was longer this time.

49
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:45,941
No one misses me,
so who would I return sooner for?

50
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:49,570
There is no one here
who doesn't miss you.

51
00:05:50,153 --> 00:05:52,541
- What are you cooking aunt?
- Pulses.

- Don't touch me.
- Why?

60
00:06:51,014 --> 00:06:55,426
I feel something when you touch me.

Why are you crying?
Tell me son. I'm like your mother.

177
00:24:14,145 --> 00:24:18,232
I have lost everything.

178
00:24:18,692 --> 00:24:22,623
- How?
- In the war.

179
00:24:22,743 --> 00:24:27,866
- Your relatives..
- None of them survived.

180
00:24:28,219 --> 00:24:30,994
- None of them.
- Where are you going.

181
00:24:34,252 --> 00:24:38,202
Where I get some peace.

182
00:24:38,322 --> 00:24:40,074
Son!

183
00:24:41,812 --> 00:24:43,859
Will you come with me?

184
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,512
I stay on the bank of the holy Ganga.

185
00:24:46,632 --> 00:24:52,205
Ganga has eliminated the sorrows of
many people.

186
00:24:53,543 --> 00:24:54,682
But mother..

187
00:24:56,002 --> 00:25:03,448
You called me mother,
now listen to your mother.

188
00:25:03,699 --> 00:25:06,945
You are unhappy because
you have last everything.

189
00:25:07,151 --> 00:25:11,119
I have everything yet I am unhappy.

190
00:25:11,832 --> 00:25:17,055
Come, live with me as my son.
We will share our sorrows.

191
00:25:17,869 --> 00:25:22,057
And then,
I am not doing you any favour.

192
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,455
I will put the burden of my
responsibility on you.

193
00:25:26,764 --> 00:25:29,906
Even I have a son, but..
You'll meet him you'll know.

194
00:25:30,444 --> 00:25:32,786
But you see him.

195
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:35,714
Come son.

196
00:25:45,332 --> 00:25:46,459
Come son.

197
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:50,377
- You've come!
- Hello mother.

198
00:25:50,497 --> 00:25:52,008
Bring the luggage.

199
00:25:58,651 --> 00:26:02,268
Titli, Titli, Titli!

200
00:26:02,464 --> 00:26:05,677
- Juman didn't come.
- Madam you!

201
00:26:05,955 --> 00:26:11,623
Juman has come. But you know
how strict he is about his prayer.

202
00:26:11,743 --> 00:26:14,322
He leaves everything aside
when It's time for prayer.

203
00:26:14,442 --> 00:26:15,532
Look..

204
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:26,848
- Hello, madam.
- How are you.

205
00:26:27,024 --> 00:26:31,235
- I'm fine, how are you?
- I'm fine. Come son.

206
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:17,013
Come son.

207
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,177
Greeting madam.

208
00:27:28,631 --> 00:27:29,631
Sit down.

209
00:27:34,063 --> 00:27:35,157
Where is Uday?

210
00:27:48,037 --> 00:27:50,432
Mother, you are back?

211
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:54,634
Who is he?

212
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,662
My name is Jitendra

213
00:27:58,987 --> 00:28:01,427
He will work as manager for us.

214
00:28:01,908 --> 00:28:05,725
We have such as huge estate.
We need someone to manage it.

215
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:08,618
And then he is very nice person.

216
00:28:11,402 --> 00:28:16,521
One who drinks tea at 8:30
in the night has to be nice.

217
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,870
He will return at 4 am
in the morning now.

218
00:28:23,324 --> 00:28:27,878
He sometimes comes on the own.
Sometimes 3-4 men bring him home.

219
00:28:36,592 --> 00:28:39,386
- Greeting sir.
- Greeting.

220
00:28:40,755 --> 00:28:42,074
Who is he?

221
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:47,815
He's Nawab lada.
But you don't misunderstand.

222
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:53,692
He's likes Mohabbatbai,
not Qayamatbai.

223
00:28:53,812 --> 00:28:57,490
- Who would you like to hear first?
- Qayamatbai.

224
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:01,878
Why? What is special about Qayamatbai?

225
00:29:02,089 --> 00:29:06,653
- Then you didn't know Qayamat.
- And you don't know Mohabbat.

226
00:29:06,935 --> 00:29:10,746
Then let's have a competition
between them today.

227
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:13,587
Agreed. But who will decide?

228
00:29:13,806 --> 00:29:17,471
Only your pockets can decide.

229
00:29:17,896 --> 00:29:18,896
Here.

230
00:29:20,403 --> 00:29:22,889
Take. Give it to
the one who wins.

231
00:29:34,276 --> 00:29:40,544
"Show me someone as beautiful
as me in the world darling"

232
00:29:41,663 --> 00:29:44,520
"And I'll bow before you"

233
00:29:44,723 --> 00:29:52,088
"Show me someone as beautiful
as me in the world darling"

234
00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:55,819
"I'll behead myself right there"

235
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:05,786
"I am Qayamat"

236
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:10,603
"The epitome of grace"

237
00:30:10,723 --> 00:30:15,744
"The epitome of grace"

238
00:30:15,978 --> 00:30:21,318
"I am Mohabbat"

239
00:30:21,438 --> 00:30:26,014
"Who people worship"

240
00:30:26,374 --> 00:30:31,016
"Who people worship"

241
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:34,808
"I am Qayamat"

242
00:30:34,942 --> 00:30:37,371
"I am Mohabbat"

243
00:30:59,103 --> 00:31:07,103
"I am beautiful' my beauty
makes people as berserk"

244
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:15,721
"They swear by my beauty"

245
00:31:15,946 --> 00:31:23,946
"I am love, you can get
me only if you are lucky"

246
00:31:26,212 --> 00:31:32,659
"Lover swear by me"

247
00:31:32,867 --> 00:31:37,563
I am the personality"

248
00:31:37,964 --> 00:31:45,964
"That people call prayer"

249
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:55,498
"I am Qayamat"

250
00:32:17,131 --> 00:32:25,131
"The one who gets just
one glimpse of me"

251
00:32:27,556 --> 00:32:34,100
"His fate begins to shine"

252
00:32:34,274 --> 00:32:42,274
"The one who gets just
one glimpse of me"

253
00:32:44,634 --> 00:32:50,997
"Is stunned to silence"

254
00:32:51,195 --> 00:32:59,195
"I am the sight.."

255
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:07,919
"That people call punishment"

256
00:33:08,234 --> 00:33:13,679
"I am Mohabbat"

257
00:33:34,768 --> 00:33:42,768
"I am youth the world call me curse"

258
00:33:48,557 --> 00:33:56,557
"I am desire, the world calls me cure"

259
00:34:01,657 --> 00:34:09,657
"If I desire, garden bloom"

260
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:20,009
"If I desire spring arrives"

261
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:25,349
"I am the ecstasy that.."

262
00:34:26,813 --> 00:34:30,367
"I am the personality that.."

263
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:38,440
"I am the ecstasy that
people calls a high"

264
00:34:38,793 --> 00:34:43,291
"People call me faithful"

265
00:34:43,672 --> 00:34:46,936
"I am Qayamat"

266
00:34:47,056 --> 00:34:48,972
"I am Mohabbat"

267
00:34:49,092 --> 00:34:53,503
"Who people worship"

268
00:34:53,623 --> 00:34:58,207
"Who people worship"

269
00:34:58,327 --> 00:35:03,879
"I am Qayamat" "I am Mohabbat"

270
00:35:03,999 --> 00:35:07,858
Wow..wow.. Wonderful!

271
00:35:07,978 --> 00:35:11,844
Mohabbatbai you are great!

272
00:35:11,964 --> 00:35:15,365
Forget it!
You decide Chamkilibai.

273
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,258
I'd say, this competition was draw.

274
00:35:23,378 --> 00:35:25,187
Then how will
we have a definite verdict.

275
00:35:25,307 --> 00:35:27,096
Assume they both are equal.

276
00:35:27,216 --> 00:35:29,303
I'll consider that defeat.

277
00:35:29,423 --> 00:35:31,633
Then arrange another competition.

278
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:16,922
Now decide, Chamkilibai.

279
00:38:17,042 --> 00:38:20,860
What do I decide?

280
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,350
The peacock wins.

281
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:25,807
So even today,
the peacock that is Mohabbatbai wins.

282
00:38:58,212 --> 00:39:00,310
Jitu, how come you are here?

283
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:09,421
Son, it is better to forget the past.

284
00:39:10,025 --> 00:39:14,981
Take my example. You have
seen how my son Uday is.

285
00:39:15,643 --> 00:39:16,643
Yet...!

286
00:39:17,985 --> 00:39:20,907
Why don't you get him married?

287
00:39:21,597 --> 00:39:25,102
I suggested it several
times but he doesn't agree.

288
00:39:25,414 --> 00:39:28,542
If he is not agreeing compel him.

289
00:39:28,937 --> 00:39:31,107
Threaten to disown him.

290
00:39:32,449 --> 00:39:36,433
I'll try even that today.

291
00:39:37,053 --> 00:39:40,515
'Pardon me friend, I am drunk'

292
00:39:43,925 --> 00:39:45,704
Madam has come!

293
00:40:03,552 --> 00:40:07,558
Uday, I want to discuss
something important with you.

294
00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:11,410
And this time,
I won't take no for answer.

295
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:12,530
Tell me.

296
00:40:13,847 --> 00:40:18,058
I want you get married son.

297
00:40:18,643 --> 00:40:19,930
- Married?
- Yes.

298
00:40:25,335 --> 00:40:32,487
If you don't marry, I'll give
away all my property in charity.

299
00:40:40,393 --> 00:40:44,282
It won't be proper to let
matters get out of hand.

300
00:40:44,673 --> 00:40:45,673
Better get married.

301
00:40:45,758 --> 00:40:50,792
If he loses all this property.

302
00:40:51,128 --> 00:40:53,886
We'll lose our free parties.

303
00:40:54,950 --> 00:41:00,243
Why fear marriage? Where you
have so many women have one more.

304
00:41:00,363 --> 00:41:02,620
Right.

305
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:05,613
I like that.

306
00:41:06,517 --> 00:41:13,284
Why fear marriage? Where you have
so many women have one more.

307
00:41:32,942 --> 00:41:35,920
- Yes, Mother?
- I still tell you, join us.

308
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:40,948
You'll proceed. I have to make
all arrangement for bride's welcome.

309
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:43,012
- But..
- Madam.

310
00:41:44,405 --> 00:41:45,452
- What?
- Come here.

311
00:41:45,572 --> 00:41:47,357
- What is it?
- Come here.

312
00:41:47,842 --> 00:41:51,867
Even stones melt with love.
Why don't you.

313
00:41:53,005 --> 00:41:54,860
For a pauper like you?

314
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,655
Don't call me a pauper.

315
00:41:56,843 --> 00:42:01,853
If you like, I'll get you
bangles of 100-200 today itself.

316
00:42:02,161 --> 00:42:05,721
You will forget it.

317
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:09,213
If I do, will you marry me.

318
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:12,967
- First get them.
- Is it?

319
00:42:13,423 --> 00:42:16,846
Let me go.

320
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,906
I'll be damned!
Where will I get money from.

321
00:42:24,446 --> 00:42:25,506
Money.

322
00:42:27,526 --> 00:42:31,193
My minting machine.

323
00:42:35,381 --> 00:42:39,248
You are calling me so lovingly,
what is the matter?

324
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:42,583
- You want money again?
- No.

325
00:42:42,818 --> 00:42:48,715
I have decided that
I'll call the priest...

326
00:42:48,835 --> 00:42:51,721
and ask him to get us married.

327
00:42:52,072 --> 00:42:55,279
- Really!
- I swear by your youth.

328
00:42:55,399 --> 00:42:58,867
If I do, I will marry only you.

329
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:04,676
But what about our wedding dress?

330
00:43:04,796 --> 00:43:09,032
How much money that will cost?

331
00:43:09,152 --> 00:43:12,616
- I'm embarrassed to say it.
- Tell me.

332
00:43:12,736 --> 00:43:15,144
There is a wall of just
Rs.100 between us.

333
00:43:15,352 --> 00:43:19,569
Then break this wall. Take the money.

334
00:43:19,689 --> 00:43:22,082
- Give.
- Get the wedding dress stitched.

335
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:25,965
You apply henna on your hands,
I'll get the dress stitched.

336
00:43:27,558 --> 00:43:31,523
Show me some good bangles,
I want to get married.

337
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:37,080
You don't need bangles,
If you want to woo a girl.

338
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,533
The moment she sees it, she'll be
drawn to you & marry you for nothing.

339
00:43:41,638 --> 00:43:44,285
Give me one charm too.

340
00:43:44,405 --> 00:43:46,233
- You want to woo a girl?
- Yes.

341
00:43:46,353 --> 00:43:48,360
- Very soon?
- Yes.

342
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,686
Then this charm won't do.
You need more powerful charm.

343
00:43:53,806 --> 00:43:55,322
- Come to my house.
- Come.

344
00:43:55,442 --> 00:43:58,715
Carry my things...
you'll have to do that.

345
00:43:58,835 --> 00:44:01,460
Okay.

346
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:08,252
Father has come.

347
00:44:10,483 --> 00:44:17,338
You have so many children?
It's the magic of that same charm.

348
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:38,730
Here the charm!
It cost Rs. 100.

349
00:44:40,181 --> 00:44:44,882
- Rs. 100!
- You will have to pay me Rs. 20 now.

350
00:44:45,328 --> 00:44:50,866
And as soon as the girl gives you
a smile pay me the balance Rs. 80.

351
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:55,367
I promise I'll give
you the balance money.

352
00:44:55,487 --> 00:45:00,703
Here is Rs. 20.

353
00:45:08,585 --> 00:45:12,366
Hello!

354
00:45:23,802 --> 00:45:28,070
- Who are you stranger?
- Wow.

355
00:45:28,756 --> 00:45:36,378
Won't you talk to me?
Even I'll come with you.

356
00:45:36,498 --> 00:45:41,835
What a wonderful
charm you have given me.

357
00:45:42,017 --> 00:45:46,340
The moment a girl saw it,
she wanted to come along with me.

358
00:45:46,696 --> 00:45:49,034
- My balance Rs. 80.
- Yes.

359
00:45:49,445 --> 00:45:55,267
Here the balance Rs. 80.

360
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:59,675
Take my blessing and leave.

361
00:46:01,022 --> 00:46:06,575
Hello, hello!

362
00:46:06,985 --> 00:46:10,596
Hello, hello!

363
00:46:14,514 --> 00:46:17,137
Well done my child.

364
00:46:18,653 --> 00:46:21,349
Did you bring bangles for me?

365
00:46:21,576 --> 00:46:29,576
Forget the bangles. I have bought
something which when you see...

366
00:46:30,126 --> 00:46:31,949
you'll say won't you talk to me?

367
00:46:32,135 --> 00:46:34,081
But I won't talk to you.

368
00:46:34,201 --> 00:46:37,056
Oh really?
What have you bought?

369
00:46:39,393 --> 00:46:44,591
Now you will say,
even I'll come with you.

370
00:46:44,764 --> 00:46:46,385
And I'll say, no!

371
00:46:46,826 --> 00:46:50,413
- But what is this?
- It's a charm.

372
00:46:50,733 --> 00:46:56,693
It will make you come running to me.

373
00:46:56,813 --> 00:47:00,872
Oh you have bought a charm
to put me under your control.

374
00:47:00,992 --> 00:47:02,995
- It cost Rs. 100.
- Rs. 100.

375
00:47:03,688 --> 00:47:07,042
- You want to cast a spell on me?
- Yes.

376
00:47:07,235 --> 00:47:12,243
How dare you use magic on me!

377
00:47:12,363 --> 00:47:15,382
Hey! Why are you beating him?

378
00:47:15,502 --> 00:47:18,572
He has bought a charm
of Rs. 100 to cast spell on me.

379
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:22,736
But I gave you that money
for our wedding dress.

380
00:47:22,856 --> 00:47:24,739
He's fooling us both.

381
00:47:24,859 --> 00:47:26,129
- Beat him.
- No!

382
00:47:46,348 --> 00:47:53,406
I won't get any of those
two I'll marry this juggler girl.

383
00:47:53,682 --> 00:47:55,912
Sir...

384
00:47:56,032 --> 00:47:57,841
Where are you trying to escape?
Come here.

385
00:47:58,447 --> 00:48:02,577
Tell me honestly how you are related
to that man who gave me the charm.

386
00:48:03,342 --> 00:48:05,507
- He's my father.
- Father?

387
00:48:05,627 --> 00:48:10,134
That means you two fooled me.

388
00:48:10,794 --> 00:48:14,494
Why are you laughing? Many marriages
take place just like that.

389
00:48:16,236 --> 00:48:19,623
How coy!

390
00:48:19,965 --> 00:48:23,682
I'll come to fix our alliance today.

391
00:48:24,194 --> 00:48:26,647
This much is enough for today.

392
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:42,159
- Juman, father will come any moment.
- Sweetheart.

393
00:48:42,279 --> 00:48:45,464
- Don't worry about him.
- Go away!

394
00:48:45,861 --> 00:48:48,615
- Let's go inside.
- I said leave.

395
00:48:48,735 --> 00:48:51,693
- If father comes, he'll kill us.
- I'm not afraid of him.

396
00:48:51,813 --> 00:48:52,813
Sit here.

397
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:55,304
Egg.

398
00:49:00,654 --> 00:49:04,880
Why had you come here?
What's in your mouth? Remove it!

399
00:49:07,606 --> 00:49:09,477
You were eating a raw chick?

400
00:49:09,675 --> 00:49:11,388
I'd put an egg in my mouth.

401
00:49:11,508 --> 00:49:17,401
But why had you come here.
With what intention?

402
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:22,603
- Marriage.
- Marriage? You think I'm a fool.

403
00:49:22,723 --> 00:49:28,161
If I get her married to you, who will
look after my other eight kids?

404
00:49:28,281 --> 00:49:31,580
Their mother.

405
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,710
She died 18 months ago.

406
00:49:35,644 --> 00:49:39,604
Why are you cry?
I'll get you another wife.

407
00:49:39,724 --> 00:49:41,590
- You can do this?
- Yes.

408
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:44,806
Then I'll get you married to her.

409
00:49:44,926 --> 00:49:48,529
Then make arrangements,
I'll get you a wife.

410
00:49:49,783 --> 00:49:51,274
You have come again.

411
00:49:51,867 --> 00:49:59,139
One who realizes his
mistake should be forgiven.

412
00:49:59,259 --> 00:50:03,641
Now you have come to your senses!
What do you want?

413
00:50:03,761 --> 00:50:09,091
Make me your forever.

414
00:50:10,235 --> 00:50:13,709
Are you fooling me like before?

415
00:50:13,829 --> 00:50:20,032
It was my mistake that
I left you and ran after her.

416
00:50:20,527 --> 00:50:25,622
But this time, I'll surely marry you,
I'll bring the priest.

417
00:50:25,742 --> 00:50:32,793
And get our horoscopes matched.

418
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:37,926
They will match!
Bring the priest tomorrow morning.

419
00:50:38,472 --> 00:50:40,712
No wait!
Bring him today itself.

420
00:50:41,557 --> 00:50:44,041
Why today, shall I bring him now?

421
00:50:44,365 --> 00:50:47,211
God blessing.

422
00:50:59,651 --> 00:51:03,646
Sit down priest.
We want to get married.

423
00:51:03,884 --> 00:51:10,252
Just check if our stars match.

424
00:51:10,372 --> 00:51:11,729
Sure.

425
00:51:15,513 --> 00:51:20,041
- Keep your finger anywhere here.
- Do it, Titli.

426
00:51:22,725 --> 00:51:24,784
Not your hand, your finger.

427
00:51:26,111 --> 00:51:27,315
Move it.

428
00:51:30,736 --> 00:51:31,736
Eight.

429
00:51:33,863 --> 00:51:34,863
Eight.

430
00:51:38,317 --> 00:51:46,317
You will get married. But on there first
night itself your husband...

431
00:51:49,034 --> 00:51:51,413
will die.

432
00:51:51,533 --> 00:51:53,279
He'll die.

433
00:51:55,219 --> 00:51:59,159
Can't this be circumvented.

434
00:51:59,279 --> 00:52:04,288
What's written here
cannot be challenged.

435
00:52:04,528 --> 00:52:08,717
- Suggest some solution.
- There is only one solution.

436
00:52:08,931 --> 00:52:12,026
- You'll have to marry someone else.
- I will not.

437
00:52:12,448 --> 00:52:16,774
If you want to marry Juman
you'll have to marry someone else.

438
00:52:16,894 --> 00:52:21,267
He'll die on the first night
then you can marry Juman.

439
00:52:22,988 --> 00:52:26,793
Marry another man first
and then marry Juman? No.

440
00:52:26,913 --> 00:52:34,908
Look, I'll get hold of some sick guy.
He will die on the first night.

441
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:37,766
And then we will unite forever.

442
00:52:39,092 --> 00:52:41,306
Congratulation.

443
00:52:51,245 --> 00:52:56,524
Close the door, and lock it.

444
00:52:57,067 --> 00:53:01,185
- How long does a moth live?
- One night.

445
00:53:01,305 --> 00:53:02,560
One night.

446
00:53:02,796 --> 00:53:05,474
- What is your name?
- Parwana.

447
00:53:05,605 --> 00:53:08,498
Understand that!

448
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:11,862
What is there to understand now?

449
00:53:12,249 --> 00:53:15,701
- We have to lose ourselves now!
- Move!

450
00:53:18,777 --> 00:53:24,722
- Do you hurt anywhere?
- In my heart.

451
00:53:24,842 --> 00:53:27,623
Wow!
Let me check your heartbeat.

452
00:53:27,743 --> 00:53:30,156
Is the pain decreasing or increasing?

453
00:53:30,404 --> 00:53:33,965
- It's increasing.
- That's great.

454
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:36,927
Then come here.

455
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:40,708
- But that's a death bed.
- You are right.

456
00:53:40,828 --> 00:53:44,581
But don't feel shy.
Everyone has to lie on it one day.

457
00:53:44,867 --> 00:53:48,892
- I won't!
- What do I now?

458
00:53:49,346 --> 00:53:51,964
You won't even if your wife tells you?

459
00:53:52,245 --> 00:53:53,594
- Queen.
- Yes.

460
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:56,101
I can even give up my life for my wife.

461
00:53:56,221 --> 00:54:00,089
That's what I want. Lie down.
You look so good in that bed.

462
00:54:00,209 --> 00:54:04,777
- Is pain is increasing?
- I'm about to die.

463
00:54:05,045 --> 00:54:09,024
- Good. Go to sleep.
- I won't.

464
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:14,804
Listen to me one last time.
Go to sleep.

465
00:54:15,575 --> 00:54:17,306
Alright.

466
00:54:17,694 --> 00:54:19,693
Sleep forever.

467
00:54:19,908 --> 00:54:22,721
Yes, sleep like this.

468
00:54:25,914 --> 00:54:28,409
Thank you god.

469
00:54:32,747 --> 00:54:35,052
Sleep forever.

470
00:54:35,284 --> 00:54:36,762
Juman.

471
00:54:40,968 --> 00:54:46,522
He's still alive..
Doesn't matter, there's still time.

472
00:54:52,214 --> 00:54:55,043
His body is still warm.
When will it turn cold?

473
00:54:58,746 --> 00:55:00,596
It's going to be morning soon.

474
00:55:02,691 --> 00:55:05,697
Juman!
God knows what's going to happen.

475
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:11,693
He's snoring, the idiot!
When will he die?

476
00:55:12,286 --> 00:55:15,834
It's morning.

477
00:55:16,996 --> 00:55:20,868
- Is it morning?
- Yes. Anything happened to you?

478
00:55:21,125 --> 00:55:23,918
I'm feeling more
energetic after the rest.

479
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:31,146
- Let's go home now.
- Home? Juman I have been ruined.

480
00:55:35,726 --> 00:55:36,952
Juman.

481
00:55:37,557 --> 00:55:38,574
Juman.

482
00:55:44,548 --> 00:55:47,612
Juman, that old man didn't die.

483
00:55:47,774 --> 00:55:51,782
Titli let's go.

484
00:55:54,746 --> 00:56:00,057
Wow what a beauty.

485
00:56:01,862 --> 00:56:07,722
Juman, when do you
want to marry my daughter?

486
00:56:07,842 --> 00:56:11,410
I would want to marry her right now.

487
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:16,131
But I have to bring
back master's bride.

488
00:56:16,497 --> 00:56:23,417
- I'll marry her tomorrow.
- Alright but I have a condition.

489
00:56:23,867 --> 00:56:26,744
And you will look after my kids.

490
00:56:26,864 --> 00:56:29,419
What? Alright! I'll manage.

491
00:56:31,799 --> 00:56:35,061
Juman, hurry.
It's time for the train to come.

492
00:56:39,111 --> 00:56:41,343
Congratulation master.

493
00:56:41,935 --> 00:56:43,964
- Jitu!
- Coming madam.

494
00:56:45,412 --> 00:56:51,539
Come Jitu. It is because
of you I saw this day today.

495
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:11,824
Daughter-in-law, it's thanks to
him that you have come to our home.

496
00:57:12,138 --> 00:57:15,055
Seek his blessing.

497
00:57:26,004 --> 00:57:31,509
Jitu come here.
Why are you quite?

498
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:34,134
Didn't you like her?

499
00:57:35,681 --> 00:57:40,895
Like?
I cannot like anyone else.

500
00:57:50,901 --> 00:57:52,011
Sit down.

501
00:57:52,773 --> 00:57:55,611
Go and sit with your friends, son.

502
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:04,012
Many night will come,
but this night will not come again.

503
00:58:04,427 --> 00:58:05,718
I don't understand.

504
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:12,248
We haven't had any liquor today.

505
00:58:12,499 --> 00:58:15,053
Our throats are parched.

506
00:58:15,173 --> 00:58:18,448
And then, you have honoured
your mother's wish, so what fear?

507
00:58:18,568 --> 00:58:22,163
Your nuptial night
will begin at 11 pm.

508
00:58:22,283 --> 00:58:27,528
That's another 3-4 hour away.
Let's enjoy till then.

509
00:58:30,148 --> 00:58:32,940
But I cannot wait long today.

510
00:58:33,158 --> 00:58:37,757
We'll be back soon.
No one will know.

511
00:58:37,877 --> 00:58:40,530
Let's not waist time.

512
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:46,383
Where is Jitu go?
Neelu go get him.

513
00:58:46,503 --> 00:58:47,792
Okay madam.

514
00:58:59,448 --> 00:59:04,071
Where had you gone, son?
Rajjo, take his blessing first.

515
00:59:04,775 --> 00:59:07,337
It's thanks to him that
you have come to our house.

516
00:59:07,617 --> 00:59:10,257
And I can see happiness
filling this home again.

517
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:13,167
Bless her son.

518
00:59:35,928 --> 00:59:36,928
Jitu,

519
00:59:36,962 --> 00:59:42,299
Just giving her the ring won't suffice.
Bless her.

520
00:59:42,566 --> 00:59:46,300
May her husband live long.
May she always be happy.

521
00:59:46,868 --> 00:59:54,214
"Be happy all happiness is for you"

522
00:59:54,334 --> 01:00:01,525
"Be happy all happiness is for you"

523
01:00:01,838 --> 01:00:08,781
"Leave the tears for me"

524
01:00:08,901 --> 01:00:15,942
"Leave the tears for me"

525
01:00:16,465 --> 01:00:23,299
"Be happy all happiness is for you"

526
01:00:45,401 --> 01:00:52,539
"Why are you sad"

527
01:00:52,659 --> 01:00:59,842
"I am there to bear all sorrow"

528
01:01:00,122 --> 01:01:07,125
"These are your days to be happy,
don't sigh"

529
01:01:07,245 --> 01:01:14,255
"These are your days to be happy,
don't sigh"

530
01:01:14,503 --> 01:01:21,718
"Don't worry until
I am around for you"

531
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:28,979
"Be happy all happiness is for you"

532
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:35,346
"Be happy all happiness is for you"

533
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:58,193
"Even if there is lightening
you need not worry"

534
01:01:58,313 --> 01:02:05,418
"It is the beginning of
a bright life for you"

535
01:02:05,538 --> 01:02:12,360
"If lightening strikes
it will strike on me"

536
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:19,707
"If lightening strikes
it will strike on me"

537
01:02:19,978 --> 01:02:27,043
"All the darkness in the world for me"

538
01:02:27,356 --> 01:02:34,472
"Be happy all happiness is for you"

539
01:02:34,712 --> 01:02:41,682
"Be happy all happiness is for you"

540
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:11,083
"Don't ever complain about spring"

541
01:03:11,257 --> 01:03:18,303
"Give me the thorns,
keep the flowers for yourself"

542
01:03:18,596 --> 01:03:25,759
"If you trample a flower by mistake"

543
01:03:25,879 --> 01:03:32,926
"If you trample a flower by mistake"

544
01:03:33,233 --> 01:03:40,277
"Assumed I have crushed"

545
01:03:40,527 --> 01:03:47,658
"Be happy all happiness is for you"

546
01:03:47,848 --> 01:03:55,108
"Leave the tears for me"

547
01:03:55,228 --> 01:04:02,716
"Leave the tears for me"

548
01:04:02,836 --> 01:04:09,528
"Be happy all happiness is for you"

549
01:04:09,778 --> 01:04:17,627
"Be happy all happiness is for you"

550
01:04:35,632 --> 01:04:42,147
Uday is in a hurry today.
Get the liquor, we are parched.

551
01:04:42,267 --> 01:04:48,160
Give him this, or seeing me,
his throat will get more parched.

552
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:53,244
Look at him! He lost but not his ago.

553
01:04:53,477 --> 01:04:58,265
One who can make others lose,
can also strip egos.

554
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:00,892
You impudent man!

555
01:05:01,903 --> 01:05:03,163
Thakur!

556
01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:00,219
Murder!

557
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:09,176
Call the police! Run away!

558
01:06:12,338 --> 01:06:16,391
Catch them all!

559
01:06:57,623 --> 01:06:58,795
Wife, come.

560
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:04,471
Why are you looking at me?
Go!

561
01:07:04,591 --> 01:07:07,414
Damn you! I have been ruined.

562
01:07:07,534 --> 01:07:15,192
Father! Sister!

563
01:07:15,468 --> 01:07:20,059
Wow! wow!

564
01:07:20,512 --> 01:07:26,627
Wow! wow!

565
01:07:26,747 --> 01:07:29,325
Wow!

566
01:07:33,558 --> 01:07:34,558
Eleven!

567
01:07:35,838 --> 01:07:36,838
Milk.

568
01:07:40,608 --> 01:07:43,781
Go away!

569
01:07:44,701 --> 01:07:47,114
Father!

570
01:07:47,234 --> 01:07:49,836
- What do you want?
- We want to sleep here.

571
01:07:49,956 --> 01:07:53,124
If you sleep here,
will I sleep in stable?

572
01:07:53,244 --> 01:07:56,648
Go sleep wherever you like,
but we will sleep here.

573
01:07:56,782 --> 01:07:59,455
Let them sleep, or they
won't sleep all night.

574
01:08:00,099 --> 01:08:05,145
All night!
Children come and sleep here.

575
01:08:05,265 --> 01:08:08,954
Sleep here..

576
01:08:09,074 --> 01:08:10,299
Sleep here...

577
01:08:23,522 --> 01:08:26,417
- My darling!
- Let the children fall asleep.

578
01:08:27,384 --> 01:08:30,266
They are all sleep.
See for yourself.

579
01:08:30,962 --> 01:08:36,563
Dear children...

580
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:39,852
- Bane, have you fallen asleep?
- Yes.

581
01:08:39,971 --> 01:08:44,705
See! Idiot!
Does one talk while asleep?

582
01:08:44,826 --> 01:08:47,266
You are trying to fool me?

583
01:08:58,102 --> 01:09:02,463
My darling, my love.

584
01:09:02,582 --> 01:09:05,105
Hey! He's beating sister.

585
01:09:05,225 --> 01:09:09,766
Get up.
Beat him!

586
01:09:09,886 --> 01:09:17,886
Save me.

587
01:09:21,609 --> 01:09:24,124
Stop it!

588
01:09:24,245 --> 01:09:27,438
You have ruined my nuptial night.

589
01:09:27,558 --> 01:09:32,123
What do you want?
Tell me.

590
01:09:32,243 --> 01:09:33,714
We'll sleep with sister.

591
01:09:33,834 --> 01:09:36,947
I won't let you sleep
with her even if I die.

592
01:09:37,067 --> 01:09:39,223
Sister, you used to sleep
with us until yesterday.

593
01:09:39,343 --> 01:09:42,200
- Why are you sleeping with him today?
- Answer him.

594
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:45,578
You are only six year old now.

595
01:09:45,698 --> 01:09:51,546
But I won't spare you!
Get lost!

596
01:09:51,667 --> 01:09:54,099
Calm down! I'll put them to sleep.

597
01:09:54,219 --> 01:09:58,196
Until you put them to sleep,
I'll myself fall asleep.

598
01:09:58,316 --> 01:10:01,354
Oh my god!

599
01:10:10,948 --> 01:10:17,811
- Hey.
- My darling, my love.

600
01:10:19,188 --> 01:10:26,225
Atleast now come into my arm!

601
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:32,461
What happened?

602
01:10:32,545 --> 01:10:37,489
What my sister and
brother-in-law wanted.

603
01:10:37,695 --> 01:10:41,316
The call for prayer has been given.
I'm going to offer prayer.

604
01:10:41,703 --> 01:10:44,530
Wow! wow!

605
01:10:45,339 --> 01:10:47,271
Wow!

606
01:10:48,463 --> 01:10:50,995
- Madam.
- Any news?

607
01:10:52,475 --> 01:10:53,475
No.

608
01:10:54,771 --> 01:10:59,792
It's 25 days since my son is missing.
Wonder how he is.

609
01:11:00,501 --> 01:11:02,642
Where he is wondering?

610
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:07,516
Why didn't I die
before seeing this day?

611
01:11:16,183 --> 01:11:21,835
- Whose plate are you bringing back?
- Jitu hasn't eating these days.

612
01:11:21,955 --> 01:11:25,768
I take his plate everyday
and bring it back untouched.

613
01:11:25,986 --> 01:11:31,284
Forget food,
I have seen him crying all night.

614
01:11:31,404 --> 01:11:34,208
How long can one survive without food?

615
01:11:34,328 --> 01:11:36,832
We'll hear news of his death one day.

616
01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:41,849
Rather than suffer every moment,
it is better one dies.

617
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:01,429
Yes.

618
01:12:04,648 --> 01:12:07,425
- At such a late hour?
- I have come to thanks you.

619
01:12:07,545 --> 01:12:09,404
- Thanks me?
- Yes.

620
01:12:09,739 --> 01:12:16,202
I had no one left, just you.
But even you have stopped eating.

621
01:12:16,894 --> 01:12:23,041
Soon enough,
I will be free of this bond too.

622
01:12:23,902 --> 01:12:29,861
- So you are waiting for that day.
- Then why have you stopped eating?

623
01:12:30,219 --> 01:12:32,174
Does love mean everything in life?

624
01:12:32,423 --> 01:12:36,115
Those who don't get love,
do they stop living?

625
01:12:36,496 --> 01:12:39,138
Is that why you got married?

626
01:12:42,292 --> 01:12:49,948
I got cable which stated..
That you were missing

627
01:12:50,099 --> 01:12:51,974
And you believed it?

628
01:12:53,508 --> 01:12:59,999
All of a sudden, I had lost everyone.

629
01:13:01,015 --> 01:13:03,304
So I lost hope on you too.

630
01:13:04,169 --> 01:13:10,239
My cousin came to take
me and I left with him.

631
01:13:11,116 --> 01:13:12,116
And come here.

632
01:13:12,218 --> 01:13:16,478
Now you want me
to live to watch all this?

633
01:13:17,541 --> 01:13:20,237
One doesn't get everything in life.

634
01:13:20,357 --> 01:13:23,636
But one doesn't even
lose everything like I have.

635
01:13:25,446 --> 01:13:29,769
Have you ever tried to find
out how I spend my days and nights?

636
01:13:30,334 --> 01:13:33,255
The night hands me over to gloom.

637
01:13:33,636 --> 01:13:37,767
And the day leaves me back
in the solitude of the night.

638
01:13:38,472 --> 01:13:41,417
I wait for the day to end,
for the night to come.

639
01:13:41,537 --> 01:13:43,537
And wait for the night
to end for the day to break.

640
01:13:43,561 --> 01:13:45,974
For how long, Rajjo?

641
01:13:47,733 --> 01:13:53,899
How can I bear that you are
before me and I cannot call out to you?

642
01:13:54,499 --> 01:13:56,973
That my eyes crave to see you,

643
01:13:57,398 --> 01:14:00,402
but I sit in a corner and shed tears?

644
01:14:02,746 --> 01:14:07,032
You step out of the mansion and I run
and open the door of the car for you?

645
01:14:07,152 --> 01:14:09,598
And salute you.

646
01:14:10,037 --> 01:14:14,619
No Jeet, forget me.

647
01:14:16,057 --> 01:14:17,102
Forget you?

648
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:20,276
How? Who can anybody forget?

649
01:14:20,396 --> 01:14:22,002
Who has forgotten anybody?

650
01:14:22,612 --> 01:14:24,170
Have you been able to forget me?

651
01:14:24,395 --> 01:14:24,958
Tell me.

652
01:14:25,078 --> 01:14:28,487
I have forgotten you.

653
01:14:28,741 --> 01:14:36,096
If that's true, come with me! Swear by
god and say you have forgotten me.

654
01:14:40,093 --> 01:14:41,435
Don't test me, Jeet.

655
01:14:41,555 --> 01:14:46,084
No, you'll have to swear by god
and say you have forgotten me.

656
01:14:48,263 --> 01:14:51,060
I swear by god that I..

657
01:14:52,895 --> 01:15:00,895
I Cannot forget you ever, Jeet!

658
01:15:12,277 --> 01:15:17,983
See! Didn't I say that
you cannot forget me?

659
01:15:18,132 --> 01:15:24,075
We cannot forget each other.
Then why live a suffocating life?

660
01:15:24,634 --> 01:15:28,996
Rajjo, I have thought of a solution.

661
01:15:29,653 --> 01:15:32,324
That will until us once again.

662
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:58,528
It's poison. The moment we take it,
we will go so for away...

663
01:15:58,736 --> 01:16:01,603
no one will be
able to separate us then.

664
01:16:08,721 --> 01:16:12,367
So what if one life went wrong.

665
01:16:12,904 --> 01:16:15,044
We will be born again.

666
01:16:16,001 --> 01:16:17,680
We will meet again.

667
01:16:18,102 --> 01:16:20,646
And unite forever!

668
01:16:21,073 --> 01:16:24,229
Drink it, Rajjo.

669
01:16:34,711 --> 01:16:35,711
No.

670
01:16:36,863 --> 01:16:38,098
Rajjo.

671
01:16:39,523 --> 01:16:44,799
Jeet, you say you love me.

672
01:16:45,219 --> 01:16:47,572
Then why were you
leading me to the wrong path?

673
01:16:48,661 --> 01:16:50,987
- Wrong path?
- Yes.

674
01:16:52,275 --> 01:16:55,395
In the morning people would see...

675
01:16:57,462 --> 01:17:03,180
Thakur Uday Singh's wife lying
dead in the arms of his manager.

676
01:17:04,301 --> 01:17:07,212
Let them talk!
Atleast we will be at peace.

677
01:17:07,332 --> 01:17:10,512
Jeet, I am someone's wife now.

678
01:17:10,699 --> 01:17:12,009
Someone's daughter-in-law.

679
01:17:12,364 --> 01:17:13,769
The honour of a family.

680
01:17:13,889 --> 01:17:18,926
Those words sound good to the ear.
But your heart will cry for me.

681
01:17:19,046 --> 01:17:21,291
I will crush such a heart!

682
01:17:21,741 --> 01:17:24,579
Rajjo, you'll regret this decision.

683
01:17:24,879 --> 01:17:28,249
No Jeet, I am an Indian woman.

684
01:17:28,767 --> 01:17:32,078
Once an Indian woman accepts
someone as her husband..

685
01:17:32,459 --> 01:17:33,930
Only he matters.

686
01:17:34,051 --> 01:17:35,211
Rajjo.

687
01:17:35,885 --> 01:17:40,293
Not Rajjo, Call me madam.

688
01:17:53,604 --> 01:17:54,604
Madam.

689
01:17:56,747 --> 01:18:01,085
Madam, a body has been found
on the river bank, 80 kms away.

690
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:05,599
It could be your son, Uday's body.
Please come and identify it.

691
01:18:07,119 --> 01:18:14,490
Madam! Gather courage, madam.

692
01:18:14,924 --> 01:18:16,096
Let's go.

693
01:18:23,623 --> 01:18:24,623
Look.

694
01:18:27,142 --> 01:18:29,723
You won't recognise the face.

695
01:18:32,227 --> 01:18:34,737
Do you recognise these clothes?

696
01:18:46,848 --> 01:18:48,886
And these rings?

697
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:54,527
These are the rings madam
had herself given to master.

698
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:55,483
Yes.

699
01:18:55,603 --> 01:18:59,853
So you identify the body
as that of your son, Uday?

700
01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:52,955
- Pardon me.
- Mother!

701
01:19:53,883 --> 01:19:56,442
My life was already ruined.

702
01:19:56,912 --> 01:20:01,676
Why did I ruin your life too?

703
01:20:05,353 --> 01:20:09,104
Madam, no one know
what happened, and now...

704
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:15,277
But it would be better if the death
related rituals were performed.

705
01:20:15,897 --> 01:20:18,090
Do whatever you feel right.

706
01:20:19,271 --> 01:20:22,029
I'll make the arrangements.

707
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:15,825
I'm Uday.

708
01:21:16,688 --> 01:21:18,857
Don't you recognise me?

709
01:21:24,745 --> 01:21:25,745
You?

710
01:21:26,454 --> 01:21:27,630
Then that...

711
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,563
It was someone else's body.

712
01:22:24,081 --> 01:22:25,672
Sir, look!

713
01:22:27,534 --> 01:22:28,837
That's a floating corpse.

714
01:22:28,957 --> 01:22:30,481
The villagers must have put it there.

715
01:22:33,796 --> 01:22:35,727
That body was cremated...

716
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:42,618
but I am wandering like a wild animal.

717
01:22:44,384 --> 01:22:49,254
I wouldn't come to you
but I have nothing.

718
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:51,333
I need some money.

719
01:22:52,432 --> 01:22:53,145
Daughter-in-law.

720
01:22:53,265 --> 01:22:54,006
Mother!

721
01:22:54,145 --> 01:22:55,444
What are you doing?

722
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:57,081
It will be disastrous.

723
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,748
The son who she has
cremated two days ago...

724
01:23:00,868 --> 01:23:04,880
if she him alive, she'll go mad.

725
01:23:06,038 --> 01:23:11,330
She'll die and I'll be caught.

726
01:23:11,918 --> 01:23:13,711
I'll be hanged.

727
01:23:14,679 --> 01:23:15,679
Daughter-in-law.

728
01:23:15,716 --> 01:23:19,180
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

729
01:23:22,844 --> 01:23:25,840
I swear by you,

730
01:23:27,067 --> 01:23:30,643
even if I have to lose my life...

731
01:23:31,268 --> 01:23:33,348
I won't tell anyone...

732
01:23:35,574 --> 01:23:36,846
that you are alive.

733
01:23:39,024 --> 01:23:40,024
Go.

734
01:23:48,682 --> 01:23:50,239
Who were you talking to?

735
01:23:50,582 --> 01:23:51,939
I...

736
01:23:55,307 --> 01:23:57,556
I was talking to my husband.

737
01:23:57,830 --> 01:23:58,830
Your husband?

738
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:11,836
Don't be so sad.

739
01:24:13,869 --> 01:24:18,096
Being his wife,
if you feel so sorry, I am his mother.

740
01:24:19,003 --> 01:24:20,426
Think about me.

741
01:24:22,296 --> 01:24:24,732
Go back to bed.

742
01:24:57,493 --> 01:25:01,134
You look so beautiful
even in a widow's attire.

743
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:05,409
Wonder how beautiful you
will look if dressed as a bride.

744
01:25:06,077 --> 01:25:09,728
Rajjo, will you do me a favour?

745
01:25:11,041 --> 01:25:13,798
I want to see you as a bride.

746
01:25:14,429 --> 01:25:15,873
Just once!

747
01:26:10,863 --> 01:26:13,873
Street Sitaram...

748
01:26:53,295 --> 01:26:55,593
What a strange nuptial night this is.

749
01:26:59,324 --> 01:27:03,128
Rajjo, you made such a...

750
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:07,186
big sacrifice for bad man like me?

751
01:27:07,597 --> 01:27:08,597
Why?

752
01:27:10,935 --> 01:27:18,935
This nuptial night could be
our first and last night together.

753
01:27:21,034 --> 01:27:24,773
How will you spend
such a long life alone?

754
01:27:26,313 --> 01:27:28,998
A woman considers her husband as god.

755
01:27:30,861 --> 01:27:35,476
Working in his interest
fulfilling his every desire...

756
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:40,362
is a woman duty.

757
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:50,180
For me, even thinking
about anyone else...

758
01:27:51,982 --> 01:27:53,527
is a sin.

759
01:27:55,689 --> 01:27:57,242
Rajjo.

760
01:28:16,962 --> 01:28:19,999
It's going to be morning! Bye.

761
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:08,473
Call your daughter-in-law.

762
01:29:27,891 --> 01:29:34,824
Every woman desire to
have a happy married life.

763
01:29:36,764 --> 01:29:38,380
But you cannot fight your fate.

764
01:29:39,491 --> 01:29:42,753
Go wear the clothes
destiny has willed for you.

765
01:29:43,472 --> 01:29:45,235
Come.

766
01:29:46,646 --> 01:29:50,115
Mother my husband...

767
01:29:52,081 --> 01:29:54,296
Look at me.

768
01:29:55,658 --> 01:29:59,600
Think of how heavy
hearted I must be feeling.

769
01:30:00,969 --> 01:30:04,977
Being a mother, I am asking you
to wear a window's attire...

770
01:30:06,237 --> 01:30:13,471
and remind me every
time that I have lost my son.

771
01:30:16,176 --> 01:30:23,503
Go fulfill the need of
society and your fate.

772
01:30:23,623 --> 01:30:25,033
Go.

773
01:30:28,462 --> 01:30:30,455
I won't get into a widow's attire.

774
01:30:32,162 --> 01:30:33,542
Why?

775
01:30:36,002 --> 01:30:38,493
What are you so proud of?

776
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:44,972
And if you are,
bring back you husband.

777
01:30:45,518 --> 01:30:50,318
So that even, I can hug him & relieve
the burden of sorrow on my heart.

778
01:30:52,237 --> 01:30:58,746
If you can't bring him back,
fulfill the society's norms.

779
01:31:05,453 --> 01:31:06,453
Priest.

780
01:31:07,065 --> 01:31:08,065
Come dear.

781
01:31:08,735 --> 01:31:11,107
Offer this water for the
peace of your husband's soul.

782
01:31:13,219 --> 01:31:14,762
Come dear.

783
01:31:24,906 --> 01:31:27,000
- I will not perform the rituals.
- Daughter-in-law.

784
01:31:27,157 --> 01:31:29,127
But why?

785
01:31:30,734 --> 01:31:34,992
Even saying that is a sin.

786
01:31:35,882 --> 01:31:37,657
It is the duty of every
wife to offer water...

787
01:31:37,681 --> 01:31:40,009
for her husband's
soul to rest in peace.

788
01:31:40,466 --> 01:31:43,873
Or your husband's soul
will keep wandering for peace.

789
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:47,563
Come and do your duty.

790
01:31:47,985 --> 01:31:49,004
Come.

791
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:50,863
- Come.
- No.

792
01:31:50,983 --> 01:31:52,235
- Come.
- No.

793
01:31:52,850 --> 01:31:57,186
Mother, I will not offer water.

794
01:31:58,643 --> 01:32:00,431
It's okay, priest.

795
01:32:01,110 --> 01:32:05,659
She's so young and
has to suffer such sorrow.

796
01:32:06,226 --> 01:32:08,196
She's not in her senses.

797
01:32:09,082 --> 01:32:12,400
But she truly desires
peace for her husband.

798
01:32:13,073 --> 01:32:16,830
Forget the rituals. Come dear.

799
01:32:19,772 --> 01:32:23,712
Daughter-in-law don't
want to be perform rituals.

800
01:32:23,832 --> 01:32:27,735
Madam says she in not in
her senses. But that's...

801
01:32:27,855 --> 01:32:32,418
We are fasting for our
husband's long life today.

802
01:32:32,538 --> 01:32:35,412
- Why mention a widow today?
- Look the moon!

803
01:33:22,651 --> 01:33:27,546
"O river Ganga"

804
01:33:27,666 --> 01:33:31,877
"O river Ganga"

805
01:33:32,738 --> 01:33:37,614
"O river Ganga"

806
01:33:37,734 --> 01:33:41,357
"O river Ganga"

807
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:47,664
"In the river Ganga.."

808
01:33:47,784 --> 01:33:52,637
"O river Ganga"

809
01:33:52,757 --> 01:33:56,505
"O river Ganga"

810
01:33:57,035 --> 01:34:01,986
"In the river Ganga,
Until the water flows"

811
01:34:02,106 --> 01:34:10,106
"May you live till then, dear husband"

812
01:34:12,963 --> 01:34:19,635
"O river Ganga"

813
01:34:19,884 --> 01:34:27,884
"May you live till then, dear husband"

814
01:34:55,542 --> 01:35:00,457
"Taking round around the fire"

815
01:35:00,595 --> 01:35:05,491
"Forgetting my past"

816
01:35:05,776 --> 01:35:10,822
"I have come to your door,
with dreams of a happy life"

817
01:35:10,942 --> 01:35:18,942
"May my lips always chant
your name""O river Ganga"

818
01:35:21,685 --> 01:35:26,590
"In the river Ganga.."

819
01:35:26,710 --> 01:35:29,268
"In the river Ganga.."

820
01:35:29,388 --> 01:35:35,947
"In the river Ganga,
Until the water flows"

821
01:35:36,238 --> 01:35:44,238
"May you live till then, dear husband"

822
01:36:16,429 --> 01:36:21,192
"This woman hides
a devoted wife in her"

823
01:36:21,312 --> 01:36:26,274
"Whose life is so tormented"

824
01:36:26,394 --> 01:36:31,380
"O husband she chants only your name"

825
01:36:31,598 --> 01:36:39,598
"May I always wear the
vermillion in my parting"

826
01:36:42,382 --> 01:36:47,175
"O river Ganga"

827
01:36:47,315 --> 01:36:51,100
"O river Ganga"

828
01:36:51,517 --> 01:36:56,532
"In the river Ganga,
Until the water flows"

829
01:36:56,765 --> 01:37:04,765
"May you live till then, dear husband"

830
01:37:07,312 --> 01:37:11,781
"O river Ganga"

831
01:37:11,901 --> 01:37:15,620
"O river Ganga"

832
01:37:16,551 --> 01:37:20,872
"O river Ganga"

833
01:37:20,992 --> 01:37:24,947
"O river Ganga"

834
01:37:25,275 --> 01:37:29,298
"O river Ganga"

835
01:37:29,418 --> 01:37:32,741
"O river Ganga"

836
01:37:49,598 --> 01:37:53,230
Look her!

837
01:37:53,789 --> 01:37:55,128
Come doctor.

838
01:38:06,338 --> 01:38:07,819
Congratulation!

839
01:38:07,939 --> 01:38:12,836
You are going to be a grandmother.

840
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:19,542
Grandmother?

841
01:38:20,912 --> 01:38:23,656
Yes, she's pregnant.

842
01:38:34,397 --> 01:38:38,100
Is what she said true?

843
01:38:42,165 --> 01:38:43,165
Yes.

844
01:38:47,874 --> 01:38:49,791
God! Such a grave sin!

845
01:38:50,791 --> 01:38:53,679
How could you commit such a grave sin!

846
01:38:54,381 --> 01:38:57,244
You had not even seen
your husband's face.

847
01:38:57,364 --> 01:38:59,654
Then whose sin did
you bring in this house?

848
01:38:59,849 --> 01:39:03,744
What are you making me pay for?

849
01:39:04,708 --> 01:39:10,637
Now I understand why you
don't want to dress as a widow.

850
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:15,169
Why you didn't
want to perform rituals...

851
01:39:15,289 --> 01:39:17,183
for my son's soul to rest in peace.

852
01:39:18,087 --> 01:39:24,457
Because you had accepted
someone else as you husband.

853
01:39:27,822 --> 01:39:28,822
Mother!

854
01:39:32,916 --> 01:39:37,181
I was suffering already.

855
01:39:39,459 --> 01:39:43,089
I lost my young son.

856
01:39:44,566 --> 01:39:49,274
Now where do I go with
this slur on my family name!

857
01:39:50,194 --> 01:39:52,283
Why will you go anywhere, madam?

858
01:39:52,416 --> 01:39:54,947
You will throw this sinner out!

859
01:39:55,067 --> 01:40:00,078
If she leaves, clean this house
with the holy water of Ganga.

860
01:40:16,481 --> 01:40:20,347
Throw this sinner out!

861
01:40:25,994 --> 01:40:28,718
What happened?

862
01:40:29,124 --> 01:40:32,085
What happened?

863
01:40:32,205 --> 01:40:34,145
What happened, aunty?

864
01:40:34,265 --> 01:40:36,767
Master didn't even see her face,
and she's carrying a baby.

865
01:40:36,887 --> 01:40:38,615
Such a sin.

866
01:40:56,576 --> 01:40:58,072
The manager's photo!

867
01:40:58,961 --> 01:41:00,065
Jitu's photo!

868
01:41:00,416 --> 01:41:01,712
Jitu's photo!

869
01:41:02,871 --> 01:41:06,622
"Rajjo, wonder what magic
spell you have cast on me"

870
01:41:07,028 --> 01:41:09,478
'I cannot forget you
even for a moment'

871
01:41:09,598 --> 01:41:15,875
'My dear Rajjo, my life is
incomplete without you' ' Your Jitu's'

872
01:41:21,161 --> 01:41:26,104
Now we understand!
She's carrying the manager's baby.

873
01:41:41,135 --> 01:41:42,846
Look, the manager's photo.

874
01:41:42,966 --> 01:41:44,474
It was found in the things.

875
01:41:44,594 --> 01:41:51,502
- See what she was secretly up to.
- The manager wrote her love letters.

876
01:41:51,622 --> 01:41:54,287
Madam, I think you should
throw out the rascal manager too.

877
01:42:09,462 --> 01:42:12,646
What's wrong with you people?
What have I done?

878
01:42:15,911 --> 01:42:19,343
Jitu, did you write
these letters to her?

879
01:42:31,116 --> 01:42:34,746
Yes, but that Jitu died long ago.

880
01:42:34,866 --> 01:42:37,711
He hasn't died,
he brought the Thakur name to dust!

881
01:42:37,831 --> 01:42:40,749
Madam, theirs is an old friendship.

882
01:42:40,869 --> 01:42:43,646
Which means you had sin on your mind.

883
01:42:44,333 --> 01:42:49,444
- Jitu, I treated you like my son.
- I have committed on sin, mother.

884
01:42:49,564 --> 01:42:54,524
If you haven't, then whose
sin is she carrying in her womb?

885
01:42:55,624 --> 01:42:56,986
Sin?

886
01:42:57,108 --> 01:43:00,084
The doctor just said she's..

887
01:43:02,913 --> 01:43:04,122
Rajjo?

888
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:07,201
I cannot believe this!

889
01:43:07,321 --> 01:43:08,667
Don't put on an act.

890
01:43:08,787 --> 01:43:10,215
What are you waiting for madam?

891
01:43:10,335 --> 01:43:13,309
It is for him that despite being
a widow, she was in a bride's attire.

892
01:43:13,429 --> 01:43:15,939
She refused to perform
the death rituals because of him.

893
01:43:16,059 --> 01:43:19,366
And this sinner
fasted for his long life.

Their sin cost master his life.

895

900
01:43:39,335 --> 01:43:42,259

901
01:43:49,455 --> 01:43:52,612

01:45:46,424 --> 01:45:54,424
"To save your husband
suffer without a word"

907
01:46:24,919 --> 01:46:29,500
"You never had any happiness"

908
01:46:31,066 --> 01:46:34,221
"You never had any happiness"

909
01:46:34,341 --> 01:46:39,666
"You even lost your love"

910
01:46:40,383 --> 01:46:45,051
"The home you
accepted as your temple"

911
01:46:45,171 --> 01:46:49,709
"You even lost that home"

912
01:46:57,566 --> 01:47:02,496
"Bear all sorrow"

913
01:47:20,569 --> 01:47:25,173
"You make the world go on"

914
01:47:26,672 --> 01:47:29,815

915
01:47:29,935 --> 01:47:35,133
"Your womb has defeated even death"

916
01:47:35,741 --> 01:47:40,365
"You are as great as god"

917
01:47:40,485 --> 01:47:44,834

919
01:48:00,245 --> 01:48:08,245
"To save your husband
suffer without a word"

920
01:48:50,039 --> 01:48:52,167
Wonder where she must have gone.

921
01:48:53,614 --> 01:48:54,614
Caesar,

922
01:48:56,073 --> 01:48:58,370

923
01:50:02,601 --> 01:50:05,277

- Who's she?
- An unfortunate woman.

926
01:50:16,082 --> 01:50:19,826
She married and was
windowed right before my eyes.

01:50:20,417 --> 01:50:21,851
And now she's pregnant.

928
01:50:21,971 --> 01:50:24,969
A widowed mother?
Has she committed a sin?

929
01:50:26,579 --> 01:50:33,820
You are a devotee of god,
forget whether she is sinner or saint.

930
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:36,636
Being a woman,

931
01:50:37,423 --> 01:50:39,705

932
01:50:43,046 --> 01:50:45,028
I'll help her.

933
01:50:45,225 --> 01:50:49,035
Please don't tell her anything
about our conversation.

934
01:50:50,815 --> 01:50:52,052
Listen.

935
01:50:52,964 --> 01:50:54,375
How is she related to you?

936
01:51:00,767 --> 01:51:02,170
She's my boss.

01:51:02,484 --> 01:51:04,168
She's my boss.

938
01:51:06,476 --> 01:51:08,994

1057
02:00:58,642 --> 02:01:00,283
I'll learn here.

1058
02:01:00,403 --> 02:01:02,432
Go from here.

1059
02:01:02,621 --> 02:01:05,743
For a sinner, I don't close school.

1060
02:01:05,885 --> 02:01:09,060
If you want to learn, then ask your
father name from your mother.

1061
02:01:09,427 --> 02:01:12,377
Mother, please tell me my father name.

1062
02:01:12,507 --> 02:01:13,727
Why are you not telling me?

1063
02:01:13,847 --> 02:01:14,493
Tell me.

1064
02:01:14,613 --> 02:01:18,131
She's also don't know
and why you want to learn.

1065
02:01:18,251 --> 02:01:21,673
In this birth, You should
repair your mother sin.

1066
02:01:21,793 --> 02:01:22,825
Go from here.

1067
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:23,932
I won't.

1068
02:01:24,052 --> 02:01:25,391
- No.
- Come.

1069
02:01:25,511 --> 02:01:26,575
No.

1070
02:01:26,805 --> 02:01:29,124
I won't.

1071
02:01:35,184 --> 02:01:36,894
Uncle.

1072
02:01:39,087 --> 02:01:39,978
What happened?

1073
02:01:40,098 --> 02:01:42,076
Teacher will not admit me in school.

1074
02:01:42,196 --> 02:01:42,823
Why?

1075
02:01:42,943 --> 02:01:45,098
Mother is not telling my father name.

1076
02:01:46,082 --> 02:01:47,337
Everyone have father name...

1077
02:01:47,457 --> 02:01:49,514
then why my father name not have?

1078
02:01:52,025 --> 02:01:53,025
Why not?

1079
02:01:54,016 --> 02:01:55,368
Today she have to tell.

1080
02:01:56,201 --> 02:01:57,994
Untill she ruined herself life.

1081
02:01:59,252 --> 02:02:01,257
Now she want to ruin child life also.

1082
02:02:02,016 --> 02:02:03,209
Don't cry.

1083
02:02:03,330 --> 02:02:04,523
I will ask.

1084
02:02:28,546 --> 02:02:32,279
Sorry to come here,
I have a question of your son.

1085
02:02:33,155 --> 02:02:35,547
Why you don't tell his father name.

1086
02:02:39,939 --> 02:02:41,702
I cannot.

1087
02:02:42,565 --> 02:02:43,955
Why not?

1088
02:02:44,372 --> 02:02:47,926
It is animals whose
fathers don't have names.

1089
02:02:48,548 --> 02:02:51,931
Do you treat your son as an animal?

1090
02:02:55,941 --> 02:02:59,090
No
- Then tell me the name of his father.

1091
02:02:59,582 --> 02:03:04,253
I told you, I can't tell you.

1092
02:03:04,392 --> 02:03:08,680
Do you want your son to carry the
burden of your sin all his life?

1093
02:03:09,553 --> 02:03:12,608
If you have given him
birth give him his due.

1094
02:03:13,107 --> 02:03:18,373
Or one day, when world
will treat him as a bustard...

1095
02:03:18,622 --> 02:03:23,357
he will come crying to you
and ask you his father's name.

1096
02:03:23,790 --> 02:03:27,583
If you cannot reveal his name
why did you bring him in the world?

1097
02:03:28,165 --> 02:03:30,110
Then what will your answer?

1098
02:03:30,611 --> 02:03:35,137
After death also people
will ask name of father.

1099
02:03:35,750 --> 02:03:36,927
Who death.

1100
02:03:37,407 --> 02:03:38,469
Raja.

1101
02:03:38,894 --> 02:03:40,140
Father name.

1102
02:03:40,265 --> 02:03:46,887
Even after death, that question
won't let his soul rest in peace.

1103
02:03:47,007 --> 02:03:48,135
No.

1104
02:03:50,177 --> 02:03:53,143
For god sake, don't punish your son.

1105
02:03:53,835 --> 02:03:55,820
Tell his father name.

1106
02:03:57,940 --> 02:03:59,601
Then do one thing.

1107
02:03:59,901 --> 02:04:01,332
Let me adopt Raja.

1108
02:04:01,544 --> 02:04:02,934
I'll give him my name,

1109
02:04:03,302 --> 02:04:04,902
so that he's at least
treated as a human.

1110
02:04:05,105 --> 02:04:07,187
Atleast he should
have right to live here.

1111
02:04:07,357 --> 02:04:10,488
- But with whose support I'll live?
- You?

1112
02:04:13,785 --> 02:04:15,620
Then play a drama.

1113
02:04:16,251 --> 02:04:20,117
One day as you blamed me criminal...

1114
02:04:20,417 --> 02:04:22,845
today that crime will be
a support of woman life.

1115
02:04:23,321 --> 02:04:26,828
- How?
- Come with me!

1116
02:04:36,614 --> 02:04:40,612
Go and tell the world
Raja's father's name is Jeet.

1117
02:04:40,732 --> 02:04:44,678
No! A woman marries only once.

1118
02:04:44,991 --> 02:04:46,602
This is just a pretense.

1119
02:04:46,722 --> 02:04:49,989
A woman's chastity
cannot be a pretense, Jeet.

1120
02:04:52,897 --> 02:04:55,390
I will wash this off with my blood!

1121
02:05:03,214 --> 02:05:09,220
Go away, Jeet! I cannot bear
such humiliation. Go away!

1122
02:06:00,363 --> 02:06:01,750
Why did you drop it?

1123
02:06:01,870 --> 02:06:07,447
Couldn't you bear to see
me forget my sorrow for some time?

1124
02:06:08,614 --> 02:06:09,883
Come here.

1125
02:06:11,906 --> 02:06:13,238
Come here.

1126
02:06:32,582 --> 02:06:37,919
Come here. Don't cry, Caesar.

1127
02:06:43,174 --> 02:06:46,100
Ma, uncle hasn't come today.

1128
02:06:46,405 --> 02:06:49,954
I think he won't come today.

1129
02:06:51,141 --> 02:06:52,147
Come,

1130
02:06:53,149 --> 02:06:54,478
Come, let's go.

1131
02:07:07,969 --> 02:07:10,616
Leave me.

1132
02:07:13,915 --> 02:07:21,024
Someone help my mother.
Help my mother.

1133
02:07:21,144 --> 02:07:23,735
- What happened?
- Save my mother.

1134
02:08:40,163 --> 02:08:47,372
Why are you running away?
If you are man enough, confront me!

1135
02:08:50,551 --> 02:08:54,216
- Madam, how come you are here?
- I was going to the temple.

1136
02:08:54,937 --> 02:08:59,498
- On my way..
- Alright, I'll escort you.

1137
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:19,067
- Ma, I'll get flowers for you.
- Alright.

1138
02:09:25,430 --> 02:09:29,263
- You?
- I'd taken jewelry from you.

1139
02:09:30,215 --> 02:09:34,668
On my way, I heard stories
about you and the manager.

1140
02:09:34,797 --> 02:09:40,498
- But Raja is your son.
- I came to know that only yesterday.

1141
02:09:45,981 --> 02:09:47,661
Master.

1142
02:09:53,370 --> 02:09:56,125
Master.

1143
02:09:57,478 --> 02:10:03,782
Master. Madam.

1144
02:10:09,165 --> 02:10:12,213
Such sin in the temple! Thrash him!

1145
02:10:12,333 --> 02:10:15,096
Run away! They will recognise you.

1146
02:10:31,268 --> 02:10:32,268
Mother.

1147
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:35,070
Mother.

1148
02:10:43,768 --> 02:10:48,398
- Who is it? A sage?
- I'm Uday, your master.

1149
02:10:48,518 --> 02:10:50,385
Master...

1150
02:10:51,236 --> 02:10:56,977
No.. no..

1151
02:10:57,097 --> 02:11:01,686
Believe me.
Look, Caesar recognizes me.

1152
02:11:02,550 --> 02:11:06,261
I am alive.
Rajjo knows everything about me.

1153
02:11:06,700 --> 02:11:09,224
Rajjo knows everything?

1154
02:11:09,344 --> 02:11:11,883
Yes, but I've made her
take an oath of silence.

1155
02:11:12,177 --> 02:11:15,833
I'll tell you everything
but please save my life now.

1156
02:11:16,253 --> 02:11:18,699
Or these people will kill me.

1157
02:11:18,988 --> 02:11:23,182
- But why?
- They saw me with Rajjo today.

1158
02:11:23,528 --> 02:11:25,986
They saw you with her?

1159
02:11:26,309 --> 02:11:28,421
That means, that child..

1160
02:11:28,541 --> 02:11:30,456
He is my son.

1161
02:11:36,340 --> 02:11:42,732
And until today
we called her unchaste..

1162
02:11:43,812 --> 02:11:46,858
Save my life.

1163
02:12:08,603 --> 02:12:10,343
Why should I save you?

1164
02:12:11,054 --> 02:12:14,931
Because of you, a married
woman had to live like a widow.

1165
02:12:15,809 --> 02:12:21,768
Dispite having a father, an innocent
child was treated as a bastard.

1166
02:12:22,358 --> 02:12:25,360
If you remain alive sin will live.

1167
02:12:25,574 --> 02:12:28,675
If sin lives, many more
sins will be committed.

1168
02:12:28,863 --> 02:12:32,939
Killing you will be doing a good dead.

1169
02:12:49,914 --> 02:12:53,248
Wait! I'm throwing
him out of the window.

1170
02:13:06,312 --> 02:13:14,007
Stop! He's dead. Let's go.

1171
02:14:38,214 --> 02:14:39,500
Master.

1172
02:14:40,512 --> 02:14:44,164
Master, forgive me.

1173
02:14:44,867 --> 02:14:49,610
I raised my hand on you.

1174
02:14:51,988 --> 02:14:55,381
You staked your life to save mine?

1175
02:14:55,501 --> 02:14:56,682
Uncle!

1176
02:14:59,700 --> 02:15:02,903
- What happened?
- Nothing.

1177
02:15:03,337 --> 02:15:07,642
It was useless blood that shed away.

1178
02:15:12,787 --> 02:15:17,888
What happened to him?-
The villagers wanted to kill me.

1179
02:15:18,980 --> 02:15:25,352
But he wore my clothes
and staked his life to save mine.

1180
02:15:26,277 --> 02:15:29,877
So that Rajjo husband lived.

1181
02:15:31,350 --> 02:15:38,166
I'd come to meet you. I thought you
are in the room but it was Rajjo.

1182
02:15:39,659 --> 02:15:43,109
That was our first night together.

1183
02:15:43,859 --> 02:15:47,385
He is my son, mother.

1184
02:15:47,894 --> 02:15:52,719
Is he is your son, Why didn't Rajjo..

1185
02:15:53,372 --> 02:15:59,809
I made her promise not
to tell anyone I am alive.

1186
02:15:59,976 --> 02:16:02,117
She is as pure as the holy Ganga.

1187
02:16:03,034 --> 02:16:06,755
Oh my god! Rajjo, forgive me.

1188
02:16:07,574 --> 02:16:13,286
- Jitu, please forgive me.
- No mother, don't say that.

1189
02:16:13,412 --> 02:16:17,788
Mother don't apologise to their sons.

1190
02:16:17,908 --> 02:16:19,102
Jitu.

1191
02:16:26,182 --> 02:16:34,182
Mother, remember one day...
you had given me a job.

1192
02:16:36,092 --> 02:16:37,185
Yes son.

1193
02:16:38,581 --> 02:16:44,657
Relieve me today.

1194
02:16:51,239 --> 02:16:53,306
Son!

1195
02:17:09,137 --> 02:17:12,755
In view of the jury's opinion
and evidence of witnesses..

1196
02:17:12,875 --> 02:17:20,375
The court accepts the fact that
Thakur Uday Singh son of Jaspal Singh..

1197
02:17:20,553 --> 02:17:23,731
Did not commit the
murder intentionally.

1198
02:17:24,829 --> 02:17:30,894
Yet the accused changed the dead
body & fooled the police for 5 years.

1199
02:17:31,286 --> 02:17:36,634
The court therefore him
to one year in prison.

1200
02:17:53,215 --> 02:17:58,943
Rajjo, it is with you penance
that I have got back my son today.

1201
02:17:59,299 --> 02:18:03,124
Remember,
one day I'd got angry and said..

1202
02:18:03,384 --> 02:18:06,177
If you have the power bring
back your husband to life.

1203
02:18:07,215 --> 02:18:13,192
You have proved that every
Indian woman is a truly devoted wife.

1204
02:18:16,088 --> 02:18:20,744
No dear, first seek
the blessing of the one...

1205
02:18:20,933 --> 02:18:22,752
who gave me back my happiness.

1206
02:18:22,873 --> 02:18:28,376
"Be happy all happiness for you"

1207
02:18:28,662 --> 02:18:35,857
"Leave the tears for me"

1208
02:18:35,977 --> 02:18:43,108
"Leave the tears for me"

1209
02:18:43,227 --> 02:18:50,318
"Be happy all happiness for you"

1210
02:18:50,439 --> 02:18:57,346
"Be happy all happiness for you"
