1
00:01:02,376 --> 00:01:04,810
You might not see
a signboard around.

2
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:07,412
So, let me tell you
that this is Melbourne.

3
00:01:07,948 --> 00:01:09,882
You might not have noticed a watch
around as well.

4
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,941
So, we might as well
tell you the time too.

5
00:01:12,352 --> 00:01:15,014
Oh, sorry.
You do know the time now.

6
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:19,088
As for the day. .
it is not a special day.

7
00:01:19,693 --> 00:01:22,719
Here, in Melbourne whether
anyone has time for work or not. .

8
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:25,727
. .they do have time for love.

9
00:01:27,334 --> 00:01:30,303
Whether it's them, or them.

10
00:01:31,304 --> 00:01:34,637
Or. . Don't laugh,
whether it's them.

11
00:01:36,343 --> 00:01:38,709
And similarly,
I fell in love with Samir.

12
00:01:39,012 --> 00:01:41,412
And we came to Melbourne
after getting married.

13
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:44,107
Love is a beautiful thing.

14
00:01:44,518 --> 00:01:46,543
But love doesn't come alone.

15
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,081
It also brings complications along.

16
00:01:49,823 --> 00:01:51,415
And we did not know. .

17
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:54,619
. .complications were
just around the corner.

18
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:38,734
Mr. Khanna and I are meeting for
the first time. And he proposed me.

19
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:40,295
Had it been any other girl. .

20
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,707
. .she would have taken
Samir's proposal seriously.

21
00:02:43,743 --> 00:02:47,770
It was his best quality Samir's
childishness which I like the most.

22
00:02:47,948 --> 00:02:51,611
It has been 2 years
since Raina became Mrs. Khanna.

23
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:54,049
It since as though
it happened yesterday.

24
00:02:54,321 --> 00:02:55,982
It seemed like she left
Dalhousie just yesterday.

25
00:02:56,056 --> 00:03:00,356
We will have to leave
the orphanage soon. - Right.

26
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:01,894
We've all grown up now.

27
00:03:01,962 --> 00:03:04,328
We had to leave this
orphanage some day.

28
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:11,703
I've got a job in Mussoorie
in a sanatorium.

29
00:03:12,005 --> 00:03:15,270
And Sister Casey is
sending me there.

30
00:03:17,511 --> 00:03:20,708
And you, Raina? Where will you go?

31
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:25,809
'None of us had an answer
to this question. '

32
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:28,614
'Each one of us had set out
to find our own destinations. '

33
00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:31,782
'And my destination would
lead me to only one place. '

34
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:36,395
'The only difference was, everyday
I would come here to thank God. . '

35
00:03:36,463 --> 00:03:37,987
'. . but today I was here
to say something. '

36
00:03:38,064 --> 00:03:39,929
'That, I'll have to leave, God. '

37
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,693
'I won't be able
to come here everyday. '

38
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:45,494
'Till now you've supported me. '

39
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:48,433
'And I know you'll take care of me
in the future as well. '

40
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:51,534
'Just show me a sign,
God and I will follow. '

41
00:03:51,811 --> 00:03:52,835
'Amen. '

42
00:04:28,448 --> 00:04:30,643
Excuse me.

43
00:04:38,024 --> 00:04:39,321
Thank you.

44
00:04:40,727 --> 00:04:42,661
I mean, sorry.

45
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:44,893
You must have heard that dialogue. .

46
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:50,097
''In love and friendship,
there's no sorry. . no thank you. ''

47
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,739
Friendship. . love. .

48
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:56,435
Yes. Let's become friends for now.

49
00:04:56,943 --> 00:04:58,342
And love. .

50
00:04:58,411 --> 00:05:04,839
You're so. . you're so beautiful. .

51
00:05:06,286 --> 00:05:09,050
. .anyone can fall in love with you,
including me.

52
00:05:15,495 --> 00:05:17,486
'I stopped half way. '

53
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:19,688
'Is it a sign?'

54
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:36,013
You are back?

55
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:40,842
Look, you got what you wished for.

56
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:43,050
But, if you keep coming here
so frequently. .

57
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:44,847
. . He'll get irritated.

58
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:49,486
By the way, do you get irritated?
- No.

59
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:51,621
No? You must. . a little.

60
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:54,089
Are you Mahatma Gandhi's aunt or. .

61
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:56,632
. . Gautam Buddha's grandma or,
are you baby Theresa?

62
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:59,796
Just like you're getting irritated
with me right now.

63
00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:02,740
You are, aren't you?
- No.

64
00:06:02,776 --> 00:06:05,870
Some times. .

65
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:09,505
For example. .

66
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:12,679
A little.
- When?

67
00:06:13,553 --> 00:06:16,454
When I'm cooking food and
the gas gets over in the kitchen.

68
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:17,615
Cooks food.

69
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:19,386
When I read out the book
for the children at night. .

70
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:21,256
. .and there's a power failure.
- Really?

71
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:23,921
When I don't get the right answer
to my question. .

72
00:06:24,264 --> 00:06:25,322
. .I get very irritated.

73
00:06:25,398 --> 00:06:28,026
And especially,
whenever someone asks me. .

74
00:06:28,268 --> 00:06:32,500
. . my surname,
I get really irritated. - Oh, good.

75
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:35,507
Surname. .
On not getting the right answer.

76
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:38,771
You know, I'm very irritated
right now. - Why?

77
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,715
Because you still haven't
replied to my proposal.

78
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,778
Understood.

79
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:50,447
Hi, I'm Samir Khanna.

80
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:59,594
Raina. - Raina.
If I ask you your surname. .

81
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:03,295
. .you will be really irritated.

82
00:07:03,603 --> 00:07:05,468
Won't you?

83
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,531
All I have is my name.

84
00:07:10,643 --> 00:07:13,476
God forgot to give me a surname.

85
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:17,916
God is just. .

86
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:20,447
What difference does it make?

87
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,885
I have a surname, Khanna.

88
00:07:21,955 --> 00:07:23,820
Do you have any objections. .

89
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,585
. . if someone down
here gives you a surname?

90
00:07:25,859 --> 00:07:29,625
You know. . my surname, Khanna.

91
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:30,854
Just imagine. .

92
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,296
Raina. . Khanna.

93
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,828
Not from the same parents,
different parents.

94
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:38,400
Raina Khanna.

95
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,701
Samir Khanna.

96
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:42,897
And Raina Khanna.

97
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:51,979
Shall we, Mrs. Khanna?

98
00:07:55,688 --> 00:07:58,282
No. . No.

99
00:08:03,997 --> 00:08:05,658
Shall we, Mr. Khanna.

100
00:08:05,732 --> 00:08:08,428
My, my! What Urdu !

101
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:11,431
''It's a strange coincidence. ''

102
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:14,769
''What a way to meet. ''

103
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:21,779
''It's a strange coincidence. ''

104
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:24,509
''What a way to meet. ''

105
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:27,348
''We meet again. ''

106
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,514
''Surely, there's something. ''

107
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:33,248
''Stop being formal. ''

108
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:35,794
''Let's get introduced. ''

109
00:08:35,862 --> 00:08:38,763
''Why are you leaving so soon?''

110
00:08:38,832 --> 00:08:44,031
''Don't say goodbye.
Don't say, goodbye. . ''

111
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:49,708
''Don't say goodbye for now. ''

112
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:07,952

''I was never like
what I've become now. ''

114
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:18,630
''I welcome the breeze
with a smile. ''

115
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:22,941
''I tell them stories,
and talk about you. ''

116
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:25,638
''Why does it all seem
like a dream?''

117
00:09:25,678 --> 00:09:28,306
''Why is someone falling for me?''

118
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:30,872
''Why am I losing touch
with the world?''

119
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,010

127
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,952
''The heart's scared
to turn around and look. ''

128
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:54,460
''What if I lose my destination?''

129
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:57,059
''You're like a blessing to me. ''

130
00:10:57,136 --> 00:10:59,798
''Don't break my heart. ''

131
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:02,397
''Don't leave me alone. ''

132
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:05,375
''Wait my life, don't go. ''

133
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:07,977
''Stop being formal. ''

00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:10,675
''Let's get introduced. ''

135
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,742
''Why are you leaving so soon?''

136

''Don't say goodbye.
Don't say, goodbye. . ''

137
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:24,692
''Don't say goodbye for now. ''

138
00:11:41,781 --> 00:11:45,581
Good morning, love.
- Good morning.

139
00:11:47,787 --> 00:11:50,415
Get me some coffee.
- It's being prepared.

140
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,852
Where's the Melbourne Times?

141
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:55,720
I think
they didn't deliver it today.

142
00:11:56,896 --> 00:11:58,989
I'll get you coffee.

143
00:12:10,877 --> 00:12:13,778
Samir, breakfast is ready.
- I'm getting late.

144
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:16,041
I have to be there by 10 : 00 am.

145
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:32,758
Why do you do this?

146
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,892
Raina.

147
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,739
Young Gun sunk them.

148
00:12:41,841 --> 00:12:43,399
His rising financial fame. .

149
00:12:43,443 --> 00:12:45,604
. .and the final
from grace fueling controversies.

150
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:48,808
I thought you will feel bad.
- About what?

151
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:50,849
The article or the photograph?

152
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:57,318
Did I like all the good articles
that you showed me everyday?

153
00:12:57,857 --> 00:13:00,587
Why would I feel bad about
this bad article?

154
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:06,630
I thought you wouldn't be able
to concentrate on work.

155
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:08,593
You'll have a bad mood.

156
00:13:08,668 --> 00:13:12,468
Your actions have given me
a bad mood.

157
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:18,573
Raina, a watch that has stopped. .

158
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:21,837
. .shows the right time
twice in a day.

159
00:13:22,582 --> 00:13:24,607
There's one bad thing
about good times.

160
00:13:24,684 --> 00:13:26,652
They soon get over.

161
00:13:26,886 --> 00:13:29,821
But, there's one good thing
about bad times.

162
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:31,584
They get over too.

163
00:13:36,362 --> 00:13:39,559
I can handle it, okay.

164
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,730
That's all for today, okay.

165
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:43,826
We'll meet in the evening.
Bye.

166
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,052
I'd like a white wine.
- Which one?

167
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:04,756
French. Chardonnay.

168
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,590
People say love isn't easy.

169
00:14:08,661 --> 00:14:11,459
But if you ask me,
it's not easy to move ahead. .

170
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:15,433
. .and try not to look back.

171
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:21,602
Nina. He's so old ! - That's why
I'm flirting around with him.

172
00:14:21,707 --> 00:14:22,969
He's not going to live for long.

173
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:25,773
And anyway, it's very difficult
to endure men for long.

174
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:27,639
You'll never change.

175
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,372
It's been two years
since you came to Melbourne.

176
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:30,506
But you haven't changed,
still the same.

177
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,880
Now, don't waste my time.

178
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:33,612
Hi. .

179
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:41,315
Guess what, Raina?
- What?

180
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:44,359
Our restaurant is opening
a franchise in the Fiji Islands.

181
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,797
And we'll be taken there
for training.

182
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,969
But I can't come.

183
00:14:56,943 --> 00:14:59,707
I know Samir doesn't like it.

184
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:01,905
Actually, he doesn't even like
the fact that you work.

185
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:04,814
And going out of Melbourne?
All alone?

186
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:06,780
Impossible.

187
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:10,419
There are so many problems with him,
aren't there?

188
00:15:12,391 --> 00:15:15,519
The problem is that
he doesn't say anything.

189
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:19,492
There are so many marriages
that have frequent spats.

190
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:21,597
But, here it's a different case.

191
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:25,801
We're going through
a very difficult phase.

192
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:30,068
Till Samir finds a job. .

193
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:32,810
. . it'll be difficult
to understand him.

194
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:40,752
An intelligent man like Samir
cannot stay unemployed for long.

195
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:42,350
He's a survivor.

196
00:15:55,601 --> 00:15:56,898
'Candle-light dinner. '

197
00:15:56,969 --> 00:15:58,994
'The authentic insignia of romance. '

198
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:01,562
'I made the ambience
slightly romantic as well. '

199
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:06,734
'It's said, when husband and wife
are eating quietly. . '

200
00:16:08,047 --> 00:16:10,015
'. . know that there's trouble. '

201
00:16:12,585 --> 00:16:17,852
'Those families, where you can hear
them chat at the dining table. . '

202
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:20,885
'. .are happier. '

203
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:24,420
'So, we should all try
to break this silence. '

204
00:16:24,697 --> 00:16:26,255
'I did too. '

205
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:30,027
I just remembered, Samir. .
how was your interview?

206
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:35,468
I gave six interviews,
and I got all the six jobs.

207
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:42,411
Raina, I don't understand that.
Do you understand?

208
00:16:42,948 --> 00:16:46,543
I do understand, Samir and
I know that you're worried.

209
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,645
But all I know is that I love you.

210
00:16:50,623 --> 00:16:52,557
I love you too.

211
00:16:54,293 --> 00:16:56,727
But, I'm a bit more
realistic than you are.

212
00:16:58,464 --> 00:17:00,659
In life, love seems beautiful. .

213
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:03,025
. .only when everything else
is doing well.

214
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:06,361
Every marriage needs
financial stability.

215
00:17:07,473 --> 00:17:10,465
Without that,
a marriage is a disaster.

216
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:17,612
What am I saying?

217
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:21,785
Sounds like I've become
a marriage counsellor or. .

218
00:17:21,954 --> 00:17:24,445
I've become professor
of Bekari.com.

219
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:31,428
I'm done with dinner.

220
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,757
I have an interview
tomorrow at 9 : 00am.

221
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,861
Let's see
if I get that job tomorrow.

222
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:38,765
Good night.

223
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:54,376
You mean to say that
my career is over.

224
00:17:56,021 --> 00:17:57,511
I'm not saying that.

225
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,289
All I'm saying is that
it's difficult for you. .

226
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:00,882
. . to get a job here in Melbourne.

227
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:04,490
Making Melbourne's leading
stock exchange company. .

228
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:06,428
. .go bankrupt is not a small thing.

229
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:09,824
I tried my best to explain to them,
but they didn't listen.

230
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:14,571
And, they sank me along
with the stock exchange.

231
00:18:15,674 --> 00:18:17,437
Well, that's exactly my point.

232
00:18:17,676 --> 00:18:19,439
No one will be ready
to take a chance with you.

233
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:21,545
But I don't understand one thing,
Raina.

234
00:18:21,614 --> 00:18:23,707
What's your fault in all this?

235
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,646
It's not my fault, it's Samir's.

236
00:18:27,052 --> 00:18:28,883
That's what Samir says as well.

237
00:18:29,021 --> 00:18:30,579
God.

238
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:34,052
But he doesn't behave that way.

239
00:18:34,293 --> 00:18:35,988
Try to understand, Nina.

240
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:38,052
Samir doesn't have a job.

241
00:18:38,297 --> 00:18:39,924
And surviving in
a city like Melbourne. .

242
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,593
. .without work, without a job. .
it's very tough.

243
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:45,762
He doesn't work himself,
and can't see you work.

244
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:47,497
What else will you two do?

245
00:18:48,007 --> 00:18:50,271
I suggest you talk to Samir.

246
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:52,703
You will get some extra money
to go to Fiji. .

247
00:18:52,778 --> 00:18:55,008
. .and extra money will
do you guys no harm.

248
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,378
Soon, your work permit
will expire here.

249
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:00,479
What will you do then?

250
00:19:02,254 --> 00:19:03,619
Come with me.

251
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:07,589
I don't know.

252
00:19:08,394 --> 00:19:12,490
Take my advice.
New place, new city.

253
00:19:13,032 --> 00:19:14,693
Maybe your fate will change.

254
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:16,291
I think you're right.

255
00:19:16,802 --> 00:19:19,896
I'll talk to Samir.
- Thank God.

256
00:19:19,972 --> 00:19:21,564
I think you're right, Sanjay.

257
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:25,767
I know I'm, but Raina?

258
00:19:26,946 --> 00:19:28,413
Raina.

259
00:19:29,381 --> 00:19:32,248
What about her?
Will she agree?

260
00:19:35,287 --> 00:19:36,811
I don't know.

261
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:46,964
Samir, I don't agree with this.

262
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,661
Leaving the city, like this. .
to a new place.

263
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:56,374
We don't have any other option.

264
00:19:57,877 --> 00:19:59,674
Start packing from today.

265
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,604
We're going to Singapore.

266
00:20:16,896 --> 00:20:17,954
Yes, Sanjay.

267
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,691
Where are you?
- We're just leaving.

268
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:21,460
Okay, hurry up.
- Bye.

269
00:20:22,535 --> 00:20:28,735
''Affection drives
away affection. ''

270
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:34,746
''What kind of ritual is this
that God made?''

271
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:41,344
''Affection drives away affection. ''

272
00:20:41,554 --> 00:20:46,992
''What kind of ritual is
this that God made?''

273
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:55,024
I'll just need to check your bags.
- Sure.

274
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,833
Now, this will surely take an hour.

275
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:03,672
I forgot I still got
some dollars left.

276
00:21:03,776 --> 00:21:06,404
Here, I suggest you buy
something for yourself.

277
00:21:06,912 --> 00:21:09,779
The duty-free shops are that way. Here.
I'll meet you at the immigration office!

278
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:27,629
Got you, moron. Got you.

279
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:42,679
I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

280
00:21:53,993 --> 00:21:56,757
So, the way you're staring at her. .

281
00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:00,726
. .seems like you've fallen in love
at first sight.

282
00:22:02,301 --> 00:22:03,962
There's never a love at first sight.

283
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,860
It's only lust at first sight.

284
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:07,804
We'll fall in love too.

285
00:22:07,873 --> 00:22:10,000
First, let's find out who she is.

286
00:22:16,382 --> 00:22:18,850
So, shall we go sight-seeing?
- Come on.

287
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:20,407
Let's go.

288
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,723
May I help you, ma'am?
- No thanks.

289
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:31,496
I'm just looking around.
- Okay.

290
00:22:31,563 --> 00:22:32,894
Come. . Come.

291
00:22:36,101 --> 00:22:39,935
She's talking. .
- Come on.

292
00:22:43,108 --> 00:22:45,508
Hey, here!
- Yes.

293
00:22:45,644 --> 00:22:47,009
Victor. .
- Sir.

294
00:22:47,413 --> 00:22:50,849
Victor sir, what was
that girl's name you were talking to?

295
00:22:52,017 --> 00:22:56,078
''Names will change. ''

296
00:22:56,422 --> 00:22:59,755
''Faces will change.

297
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:05,022
''Only my voice is my true identity. . ''

298
00:23:05,264 --> 00:23:06,288
Boarding pass. .

299
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:07,855
You must have checked her boarding
pass. Please, take a look.

300
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:09,763
She didn't have a boarding pass.

301
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,907
Why?
- She seemed familiar.

302
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:18,704
I know what's going on in
your mind right now.

303
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:20,606
She was Mrs. Khanna.

304
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:22,579
Mrs. Khanna.
- She's on her way to Singapore.

305
00:23:22,715 --> 00:23:25,343
She wanted to buy a gift
for her husband.

306
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:26,850
She's married.

307
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:31,887
''Your dreams. . have shattered. ''

308
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:35,519
''You are not here. ''

309
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:45,068
What did I do?

310
00:23:46,105 --> 00:23:47,732
Why did you take so long?

311
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:51,498
Samir, I couldn't buy anything.
- Why?

312
00:23:52,444 --> 00:23:54,844
We had to endure
so much for this money.

313
00:23:54,947 --> 00:23:57,711
So, I thought I'll keep it safely.

314
00:23:58,684 --> 00:24:00,675
As a memory of Melbourne.

315
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,254
Okay.
- Where's Sanjay?

316
00:24:05,657 --> 00:24:08,057
Sanjay is waiting for me inside.
- Come on.

317
00:24:08,293 --> 00:24:12,320
Listen. Here's your passport.

318
00:24:13,332 --> 00:24:14,924
Your flight leaves in two hours.

319
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:16,934
And mine leaves in an hour.

320
00:24:18,504 --> 00:24:21,667
Samir, you didn't tell me. .

321
00:24:21,707 --> 00:24:23,504
. .we're travelling
in two different flights.

322
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:32,607
Samir, there's a mistake.

323
00:24:32,951 --> 00:24:34,919
This boarding card is for Delhi.

324
00:24:37,055 --> 00:24:38,920
I'm coming with you, right?

325
00:24:43,796 --> 00:24:44,854
No.

326
00:24:46,498 --> 00:24:48,363
And, please don't start an argument. .

327
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:51,794
. .and don't say,
that ''How can you do this?''

328
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,608
Because you know,
I can do anything. .

329
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:03,507
. .to save our love,
and our marriage.

330
00:25:11,957 --> 00:25:13,948
Is this why you brought me here. .

331
00:25:14,693 --> 00:25:16,718
. .so that you can take
the decisions of my life?

332
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:21,960
I want to come with you.

333
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:25,798
Please understand I'm on your side.

334
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:28,500
Why are you being so stiff?

335
00:25:29,374 --> 00:25:30,671
Let me go.

336
00:25:38,317 --> 00:25:40,478
Papa and mummy
have realized their mistake.

337
00:25:41,753 --> 00:25:43,721
They are coming to
the airport to pick you up.

338
00:25:45,457 --> 00:25:47,049
Call me as soon you reach.

339
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:51,729
Come. I'll walk you to your gate.
- Don't worry about me.

340
00:25:53,332 --> 00:25:56,995
I can manage that much
to board the flight alone.

341
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:03,474
Raina, have faith in me.

342
00:26:04,543 --> 00:26:06,340
Please try to understand me.

343
00:26:10,883 --> 00:26:17,550
I love you. - ''What's gone wrong
in this journey?''

344
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:24,523
''The efforts are mine, but the
destination belongs only to you. ''

345
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:31,360
''With a heart filled
with the sorrow of separation. ''

346
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:36,974
''I'll search for you once again,

''Everything seems
forlorn without you. ''

348
00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:43,610
''Without you,
the world seems forlorn. ''

349
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:47,080
''My eyes search for you. ''

350
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:52,015
''Don't leave me alone like this. ''

351
00:26:56,795 --> 00:26:58,422
Is everything fine?

352
00:26:58,664 --> 00:27:01,690

What did Victor say that
girl's name was? - Mrs. Khanna.

362
00:27:42,607 --> 00:27:43,767
This is last and final call.

363
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:45,868
This announcement is for her,
isn't it?

364
00:27:45,978 --> 00:27:47,946
Yes, but she was supposed to go
to Singapore. .

365
00:27:48,013 --> 00:27:49,947
. .and this announcement
is for flight to Delhi.

366
00:27:50,782 --> 00:27:55,515
These girls! God knows,
what goes on in their mind.

367
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:08,422

368

Thanks.

375
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,390
Can I use your phone?

376
00:28:35,527 --> 00:28:38,826
Actually, I don't have the time
to go to the phone booth.

377
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:40,023
My flight is about to leave. .

378

. .can I please make an urgent call?

379
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:51,669
Just, two seconds.

380
00:28:51,777 --> 00:28:55,269
Hello.
- Hello, Nina this is Raina.

381
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,471
Hi, are you still in Melbourne. .

382
00:28:57,549 --> 00:28:59,039
. .or have you reached Singapore?

383
00:29:00,552 --> 00:29:03,953
No, I'm not going to Singapore.
- Why?

384
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:27,939
Didn't I tell you before. .

385
00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:30,311
. . Samir isn't behaving right
with you?

386
00:29:30,382 --> 00:29:34,318
Please. This is not the time
to discuss Samir.

387
00:29:34,386 --> 00:29:36,286
I don't want to go back to Delhi.

388
00:29:36,354 --> 00:29:39,414
I have very less time,
and only two choices.

389
00:29:39,491 --> 00:29:41,982
Either, I take the flight
to Delhi leaving in ten minutes. .

390
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,721
. .or stay back and work again.

391
00:29:44,062 --> 00:29:48,294
Raina, we've already reached Fiji.

392
00:29:52,037 --> 00:29:54,267
Then that leaves me
with just one option.

393
00:29:54,606 --> 00:29:56,870
You know what?
You have Nina.

394
00:29:56,908 --> 00:29:58,000
You don't want to go, do you?

395
00:29:58,276 --> 00:29:59,402
Then don't go.

396
00:29:59,478 --> 00:30:01,946
Give me an hour,
and I'll arrange a job. .

397
00:30:02,013 --> 00:30:03,344
. .and a place to stay for you.

398
00:30:03,415 --> 00:30:05,940
Where are you right now?
- I'm in the Departures area.

399
00:30:06,485 --> 00:30:07,713
Where can I wait?

400
00:30:09,888 --> 00:30:13,289
There's a café in Departures.
It belongs to me.

401
00:30:14,493 --> 00:30:18,088
You can wait there
till your friend arrives.

402
00:30:23,068 --> 00:30:26,435
Nina, there's a café in Departures. .

403
00:30:26,738 --> 00:30:28,035
I am waiting there.

404
00:30:28,306 --> 00:30:29,432
Okay.

405
00:30:32,911 --> 00:30:35,573
Look, it's okay that
you're helping me out.

406
00:30:35,647 --> 00:30:37,945
But you shouldn't eavesdrop
on my conversation.

407
00:30:38,116 --> 00:30:39,674
What can I do?

408
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:41,876
You seemed so tensed while talking.

409
00:30:41,953 --> 00:30:43,921
I couldn't help myself.

410
00:30:46,525 --> 00:30:47,685
Phone.

411
00:30:49,761 --> 00:30:50,887
Shall we?

412
00:30:57,335 --> 00:30:59,860
One cappuccino.
- One cappuccino? Okay. Yeah.

413
00:31:08,346 --> 00:31:10,337
'In life, love seems beautiful. . '

414
00:31:10,415 --> 00:31:11,814
'. .only when everything else
is doing well. '

415
00:31:11,883 --> 00:31:13,714
'Every marriage needs
financial stability. '

416
00:31:13,785 --> 00:31:17,312
'Without that,
marriage is a disaster. '

417
00:31:19,424 --> 00:31:20,652
Raina?

418
00:31:21,693 --> 00:31:23,820
Tia. Tia Roberts.

419
00:31:23,895 --> 00:31:25,385
Nina's friend.

420
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:29,799
Nina told me that
you'll be waiting for me. .

421
00:31:29,868 --> 00:31:31,563
. . here in the cafeteria.

422
00:31:33,405 --> 00:31:34,804
Hi, Tia.
- Hi.

423
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:37,000
How's everything?
- Fine.

424
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:39,406
I've come to take Raina.

425
00:31:39,511 --> 00:31:40,569
Oh, I see.

426
00:31:40,645 --> 00:31:41,737
Good, good.

427
00:31:41,813 --> 00:31:43,610
By the way,
Mrs. Khanna if you need. .

428
00:31:43,682 --> 00:31:45,479
. .any kind of help here,
you can tell Akash. .

429
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,949
I mean, do let us know.

430
00:31:47,018 --> 00:31:51,819
Oh, please. Have you two ever
done anything right in your life. .

431
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,017
. .that you want to help her.

432
00:31:54,893 --> 00:31:56,861
You've failed so many times
in your examinations. .

433
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:59,863
. .that you're ashamed
to go back to India.

434
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,332
With your Australian citizenship. .

435
00:32:04,402 --> 00:32:08,304
. .you got a waiter's job,
and that's more than enough for you.

436
00:32:09,975 --> 00:32:12,773
Hey, try to get your life
in the right direction first. .

437
00:32:12,811 --> 00:32:14,540
. .and then you can help others.

438
00:32:14,613 --> 00:32:15,705
Okay?

439
00:32:16,514 --> 00:32:18,982
Whoever we are,
at least we're originals.

440
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:21,678
We're not Julia Robert's
duplicate like you.

441
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,478
Raina, let's go.
- Where?

442
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:27,650
Home. My home.

443
00:32:27,726 --> 00:32:30,923
Till Nina returns,
you'll stay in my home.

444
00:32:43,408 --> 00:32:45,399
Here. Coffee.

445
00:32:47,879 --> 00:32:49,369
It's okay.

446
00:32:49,814 --> 00:32:52,749
People separate like
they're doing a favour.

447
00:32:53,952 --> 00:32:55,943
Tia, we haven't separated.

448
00:32:56,655 --> 00:32:58,418
We have some problems.

449
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,459
Problems? What problems?
Which problems?

450
00:33:01,526 --> 00:33:03,619
These things don't matter.

451
00:33:03,962 --> 00:33:07,420
Today, you're alone,
your husband has left you.

452
00:33:07,699 --> 00:33:09,462
And that's the truth.

453
00:33:12,437 --> 00:33:14,701
Look, Raina
if you want to stay here. .

454
00:33:14,806 --> 00:33:16,603
. .you will have to work.

455
00:33:17,676 --> 00:33:20,304
I'll get you a job at the airport.

456
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:22,812
I can use
my influence wherever I can.

457
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:28,745
Come on.
We'll leave in an hour, okay.

458
00:33:39,798 --> 00:33:41,095
What's up, Duffers?

459
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:43,733
Hey, Julia. .
I'm sorry, Tia. Ask her.

460
00:33:43,902 --> 00:33:46,427
Oh, no she's really
looking like Julia today.

461
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:51,741
Julia, where's Mrs. Khanna?

462
00:33:52,811 --> 00:33:55,371
Her. I got her a job.

463
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:57,438
Where? - Here.

464
00:33:59,718 --> 00:34:00,878
Here.

465
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:17,498
You have a voice massage.

466
00:34:17,569 --> 00:34:20,970
Hi, sweetheart.
Hope you had a safe journey.

467
00:34:21,706 --> 00:34:25,574
Samir, please carefully listen
to whatever I'm going to say now.

468
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:27,472
And don't be worried.

469
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:29,376
Last night, after you left. .

470
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:34,979
. .I decided I won't go back,
and I didn't go.

471
00:34:36,988 --> 00:34:39,980
Just like you took a decision
for our betterment. .

472
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:43,954
. .similarly,
I took a decision as well.

473
00:34:44,095 --> 00:34:46,757
I hope you don't misunderstand me,
Samir.

474
00:34:47,065 --> 00:34:49,033
You've left me back here.

475
00:34:49,534 --> 00:34:50,660
And you'll find the same Raina. .

476
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:52,930
. . here in Melbourne,
waiting with a smile on her face.

477
00:34:53,104 --> 00:34:57,905
And I'm sure, you'll come back soon.

478
00:35:04,482 --> 00:35:06,416
Raina did not go with flight.

479
00:35:08,486 --> 00:35:11,853
Congratulations, Raina.
You've got the job.

480
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,951
Tomorrow morning, from 9 : 00am.

481
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:15,993
God bless you. Go.
- Thank you.

482
00:35:20,598 --> 00:35:22,293
Congratulations, Mrs. Khanna.

483
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:25,029
I heard that you've got a job.
- Yes.

484
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,301
So, we'll keep meeting now.

485
00:35:28,506 --> 00:35:31,964
I forgot to thank you for letting me
use your phone the other day.

486
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,375
Not at all Mrs. Khanna.

487
00:35:33,478 --> 00:35:35,503
But the next time
you need to make a call. .

488
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:39,812
. .and I'm not around, I'll show
you a local trick to make a call.

489
00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:42,852
Meaning? - Come, I'll tell you.

490
00:35:44,022 --> 00:35:45,319

the free fund phone.

00:35:59,737 --> 00:36:01,466
Press number one, four times.

499
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:03,473
And then, the number.

500
00:36:04,576 --> 00:36:07,909
I'll dial that. - Go ahead.

501
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:13,975
Hello.

502
00:36:14,052 --> 00:36:16,816
Hello, Samir.
- What the hell is this, Raina?

503
00:36:18,022 --> 00:36:19,853
Where are you
and what's this childishness?

504
00:36:20,258 --> 00:36:21,987
Do you know how worried
I'm about you?

505
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,028
And, who asked you to do all this?

506
00:36:24,596 --> 00:36:27,997
No one even asked me what
I would like to do.

507
00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:29,727
Stop it, Raina.

508
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:32,266
There's a limit to everything.

509
00:36:33,338 --> 00:36:35,704
Don't you understand why
and for whom I'm doing all this?

510
00:36:35,773 --> 00:36:39,470
Samir, I didn't want to go back.

511
00:36:39,878 --> 00:36:41,675
And you know the reason.

512
00:36:41,746 --> 00:36:44,772
Raina, please go back.
For my sake.

513
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:47,016
Please go.

514
00:36:47,385 --> 00:36:48,579
Or else, I'm coming back.

515
00:36:48,653 --> 00:36:51,417
Samir, I didn't stay back. .

516
00:36:51,489 --> 00:36:53,923
. .to make you feel guilty
for what you did.

517
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:56,527
And neither to call you back.

518
00:36:57,362 --> 00:37:00,593
Just do what you've decided.

519
00:37:02,433 --> 00:37:03,991
And as far as I'm concerned. .

520
00:37:04,602 --> 00:37:08,368
. .I've found a job,
as well as a place to stay.

521
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:14,002
Fine. Fine, I'm coming back.
- No, Samir.

522
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:16,540
If you come back. .

523
00:37:16,614 --> 00:37:18,741
. . it'll just aggravate
the problems between us.

524
00:37:18,816 --> 00:37:21,683
I'm not forcing you
to change your decision.

525
00:37:22,053 --> 00:37:24,954
And I want you to do the same.

526
00:37:26,424 --> 00:37:28,051
You take care, Samir.

527
00:37:28,626 --> 00:37:30,651
And return successful.

528
00:37:30,995 --> 00:37:32,895
Not as unsuccessful Samir.

529
00:37:33,698 --> 00:37:36,360
Because life doesn't
give many opportunities.

530
00:38:06,998 --> 00:38:08,659
Oops, sorry.
- Move aside.

531
00:38:10,868 --> 00:38:12,233
Table nine.

532
00:38:15,473 --> 00:38:18,931
Hi, Akash.
- Hello, Mrs. Khanna.

533
00:38:21,312 --> 00:38:22,870
I want to give you something.

534
00:38:23,314 --> 00:38:24,474
Just don't lecture me.

535
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:26,244
Otherwise, you can give me anything.

536
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,053
You got your first salary?
Congratulations. - Thanks.

537
00:38:32,624 --> 00:38:35,058
I have to pay you
for that trunk call.

538
00:38:35,293 --> 00:38:37,284
You can take any amount you want.

539
00:38:37,762 --> 00:38:43,496
Cash. Mrs. Khanna,
I believe in kind and not cash?

540
00:38:43,701 --> 00:38:48,400
Meaning?
- Dinner. What did you think?

541
00:38:51,876 --> 00:38:53,366
Got you.

542
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,225
Isn't it a fantastic place?

543
00:39:17,902 --> 00:39:21,429
Sometimes I wonder
when I grow that old. .

544
00:39:22,373 --> 00:39:27,367
. .who will be the fortunate
old woman that will dance with me.

545
00:39:27,445 --> 00:39:29,970
Young man, would you like
to have a dance with me. .

546
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,948
. . if your girl doesn't mind?

547
00:39:33,918 --> 00:39:36,785
Yes, of course.
He's all yours.

548
00:39:37,021 --> 00:39:39,717
There.
You've got your answer.

549
00:39:42,293 --> 00:39:43,920
Come on, old woman.

550
00:39:44,395 --> 00:39:45,521
Come on. Let's go.

551
00:39:52,503 --> 00:39:54,471
'There's one bad thing,
about good times. '

552
00:39:54,505 --> 00:39:56,302
'They soon get over. '

553
00:39:56,574 --> 00:39:59,065
'But, there's one good thing
about bad times. '

554
00:39:59,277 --> 00:40:01,006
'They get over too. '

555
00:40:01,412 --> 00:40:03,744
Where are you lost, Mrs. Khanna?

556
00:40:04,816 --> 00:40:07,341
You were thinking about Samir,
weren't you?

557
00:40:07,885 --> 00:40:10,445
Actually, Mrs. Khanna. .

558
00:40:10,521 --> 00:40:12,421
. . Mr. Khanna will come back
when you grow that old.

559
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:16,657
Your dinner.
- Thanks.

560
00:40:17,795 --> 00:40:20,025
Akash, it's not a joke.

561
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:22,089
Samir is my husband.

562
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,898
Samir has separated from me. .

563
00:40:25,336 --> 00:40:26,894
. . because he wants to do something.

564
00:40:26,971 --> 00:40:28,336
He wants to be someone.

565
00:40:28,406 --> 00:40:30,306
Okay, agreed that
he'll come back for you. .

566
00:40:30,408 --> 00:40:31,602
. .when he's successful.

567
00:40:31,642 --> 00:40:33,542
But, when he faces
the next problem. .

568
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:36,011
. .will he say,
''We'll meet after a short break''?

569
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,308
What is this?

570
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:39,076
Is this a relationship
or a television serial?

571
00:40:39,317 --> 00:40:41,615
How much do you know Samir, Akash?

572
00:40:41,986 --> 00:40:44,079
The fact that he couldn't
do anything for me. .

573
00:40:44,322 --> 00:40:45,789
. .was troubling him.

574
00:40:46,124 --> 00:40:47,921
Otherwise, it wouldn't have made
a difference to him.

575
00:40:47,992 --> 00:40:49,857
I was adjusting myself.

576
00:40:51,429 --> 00:40:52,953
He has promised to give me. .

577
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,089
. .every happiness in life, Akash.

578
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:57,130
And he has gone away
to fulfil that promise.

579
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:02,306
Mrs. Khanna, anyone can
stay happy during good times.

580
00:41:02,406 --> 00:41:05,569
But a true man imparts happiness
to everyone. .

581
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,339
. .whether he's happy or not.

582
00:41:10,515 --> 00:41:13,075
Mrs. Khanna,
you took that seriously.

583
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,012
Sorry.

584
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,880
Mrs. Khanna.

585
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:23,620
She must be on her way
to the bathroom.

586
00:41:23,694 --> 00:41:25,286
Mrs. Khanna.

587
00:41:30,968 --> 00:41:32,367
No.

588
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:36,905
''Who. . is that lovely lady?''

589
00:41:36,941 --> 00:41:41,810
''Walking down the street. .
she's driving me crazy. ''

590
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:46,407
''Who. . is that lovely lady?''

591
00:41:46,484 --> 00:41:48,611
''The way she's swaying her hips
and thighs. ''

592
00:41:48,686 --> 00:41:50,051
''She got me mesmerised. ''

593
00:41:50,488 --> 00:41:52,786
''She's driving me crazy. ''

594
00:41:52,857 --> 00:41:57,556
''Ooh Mrs. Khanna.
Ooh Mrs. Khanna. ''

595
00:41:57,795 --> 00:42:00,320
''Ooh Mrs. Khanna. ''

596
00:42:12,777 --> 00:42:15,268
''Baby, you drive me crazy. ''

597
00:42:15,346 --> 00:42:20,306
''Give me chance to make you mine. ''

598
00:42:25,623 --> 00:42:30,560
''Please smile, come closer. ''

599
00:42:30,628 --> 00:42:35,793
''If you're leaving,
give me your address. ''

600
00:42:40,638 --> 00:42:45,541
''If anyone tries to impress me. ''

601
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:49,979
''Believe it or not,
he won't be successful. ''

602
00:42:50,047 --> 00:42:54,882
''Don't be upset, don't be upset,
don't be upset. ''

603
00:42:54,952 --> 00:42:57,614
''You're my-my Mrs. Khanna. ''

604
00:42:57,688 --> 00:43:00,350
''You're my-my Mrs. Khanna. ''

605
00:43:10,001 --> 00:43:12,492
''Come dance with me. ''

606
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:15,261
''Come dance with me. ''

607
00:43:15,506 --> 00:43:17,565
''Dance with me romance with me. ''

608
00:43:17,608 --> 00:43:20,736
''Come, listen to my heartbeat. ''

609
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:38,322
''You're so boring. ''

610
00:43:38,396 --> 00:43:40,694
''You make such a ruckus. ''

611
00:43:40,765 --> 00:43:43,290
''You have a habit
of following around. ''

612
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:46,495
''You bore me. ''

613
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:53,302
''I haven't lied. ''

614
00:43:53,344 --> 00:43:55,710
''Since you've arrived. ''

615
00:43:55,780 --> 00:44:00,114
''I've only spoken the truth. ''

616
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:02,616
''My fervour. . this is my fervour. . ''

617
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,985
''So, how do you like my fervour?''

618
00:44:05,056 --> 00:44:07,581
''You're my-my Mrs. Khanna. ''

619
00:44:07,658 --> 00:44:09,888
''You're my-my Mrs. Khanna. ''

620
00:44:09,961 --> 00:44:12,589
''You're my-my Mrs. Khanna. ''

621
00:44:12,663 --> 00:44:14,961
''You're my-my Mrs. Khanna. ''

622
00:44:15,032 --> 00:44:17,592
''You're my-my Mrs. Khanna. ''

623
00:44:17,668 --> 00:44:20,000
''You're my-my Mrs. Khanna. ''

624
00:44:20,071 --> 00:44:22,801
''You're my-my Mrs. Khanna. ''

625
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:28,836
Then came Christmas.
A mood for celebration.

626
00:44:28,913 --> 00:44:32,974
Where the world gathered together,
I was with Samir last time.

627
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:35,814
I don't know what I will be doing
on New Year's eve.

628
00:44:35,886 --> 00:44:39,322
But I don't know that
somebody will be alone like me.

629
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,017
''Silent night. Holy night. ''

630
00:44:41,092 --> 00:44:43,822
Why are you looking upset?
- I do, don't I?

631
00:44:43,894 --> 00:44:45,521
You do, or are you?

632
00:44:45,596 --> 00:44:48,087
What's on my mind?
- Mrs. Khanna.

633
00:44:48,566 --> 00:44:50,295
Wish you a Happy New Year.
- Thanks.

634
00:44:50,368 --> 00:44:51,562
You're a scoundrel.

635
00:44:51,635 --> 00:44:52,863
You're a scoundrel.

636
00:44:52,937 --> 00:44:54,427
All the best.

637
00:44:54,538 --> 00:44:55,630
I'll close up. .
- She's coming.

638
00:44:55,706 --> 00:44:57,401
Okay. - Go, go.

639
00:45:13,491 --> 00:45:17,484
Hi, Akash.
- Hi, Mrs. Khanna.

640
00:45:17,561 --> 00:45:20,029
Something wrong?
- It's nothing.

641
00:45:21,465 --> 00:45:22,898
What's the matter?

642
00:45:24,335 --> 00:45:27,998
Nothing. New Year's eve.

643
00:45:28,506 --> 00:45:30,906
No family, no friends in Australia.

644
00:45:31,876 --> 00:45:33,741
I'm feeling alone.

645
00:45:35,046 --> 00:45:38,812
Where's Arsh?
- He's gone on a date.

646
00:45:40,851 --> 00:45:43,479
And sadly,
he's my only friend in Australia.

647
00:45:48,492 --> 00:45:49,823
I'm there.

648
00:45:57,334 --> 00:45:58,801
Cheers.

649
00:46:07,011 --> 00:46:10,970
It's over. - It's over.

650
00:46:11,048 --> 00:46:12,276
Yes.

651
00:46:13,317 --> 00:46:17,811
So, where was I?
- With Samir, on last New Year's eve.

652
00:46:17,988 --> 00:46:24,894
Yes. So I told Samir,
''Everything goes, Samir''.

653
00:46:24,962 --> 00:46:26,554
''It's New Year's eve today, Samir. ''

654
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:29,394
''You can drink as much as you want. ''

655
00:46:29,467 --> 00:46:33,369
So that night, Samir made me drink
so much, so much. .

656
00:46:33,437 --> 00:46:36,304
He made you drink a lot.
- Right.

657
00:46:36,974 --> 00:46:38,908
Then Samir.
- Again Samir?

658
00:46:38,976 --> 00:46:41,274
That's what I was saying.

659
00:46:41,445 --> 00:46:45,347
How did Samir take me home. .

660
00:46:45,416 --> 00:46:48,943
. . how did Samir tuck me in,
I don't remember anything.

661
00:46:51,622 --> 00:46:57,322
You don't remember anything
once you're drunk. - No.

662
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:01,254
You need to eat something.

663
00:47:01,332 --> 00:47:02,924
I'll get you something to eat.

664
00:47:05,536 --> 00:47:08,437
No one has any grievances
against anyone.

665
00:47:08,672 --> 00:47:11,334
Nor does anyone control anyone.

666
00:47:11,942 --> 00:47:19,246
The one whom I consider closest. .
he desires someone else.

667
00:47:22,653 --> 00:47:25,554
Sorry, Mrs. Khanna.
I didn't understand anything.

668
00:47:27,925 --> 00:47:29,517
No, I'm sorry.

669
00:47:29,593 --> 00:47:31,288
It doesn't matter
whether you care for me or not.

670
00:47:31,362 --> 00:47:33,262
But Samir cares for me.

671
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:35,798
Samir. That's why he left.

672
00:47:35,866 --> 00:47:37,993
Rather than wasting my time
with you. .

673
00:47:38,068 --> 00:47:40,502
. .I would talk to Samir.

674
00:47:41,805 --> 00:47:45,866
Mrs. Khanna,
remember four times number one.

675
00:47:51,549 --> 00:47:52,914
I remember.

676
00:47:54,518 --> 00:47:57,749
Samir didn't pick up the phone.

677
00:47:57,821 --> 00:47:59,288
Mrs. Khanna, be careful.

678
00:47:59,356 --> 00:48:02,723
Samir didn't pick up the phone.

679
00:48:03,894 --> 00:48:09,696
Akash. .
Samir didn't pick up the phone.

680
00:48:11,669 --> 00:48:14,433
Samir didn't pick up the phone.

681
00:48:14,471 --> 00:48:16,462
I know, drunkard. Sorry.

682
00:48:19,476 --> 00:48:23,435
Samir didn't pick up the phone.

683
00:48:23,514 --> 00:48:26,506
You got it right.
Samir didn't pick up the phone.

684
00:48:36,026 --> 00:48:43,899
''They seem so nice. ''

685
00:48:50,474 --> 00:48:57,846
''They seem so nice. ''

686
00:48:58,449 --> 00:48:59,882
''What?''

687
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:09,689
''The earth, the rivers, the night. .
- And?''

688
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,524
''And you. ''

689
00:49:12,963 --> 00:49:17,627
''They seem so nice. ''

690
00:49:17,768 --> 00:49:25,265
''The earth, the rivers, the night. .
- And?''

691
00:49:25,342 --> 00:49:27,833
''And you. ''

692
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,979
Sorry.

693
00:49:31,615 --> 00:49:34,914
Mrs. Khanna.

694
00:49:37,888 --> 00:49:38,980
Are you okay?

695
00:49:39,056 --> 00:49:40,455
Yeah.

696
00:49:42,426 --> 00:49:44,860
You care a lot about me.

697
00:49:45,596 --> 00:49:48,861
Of course, Mrs. Khanna.
You're very special.

698
00:49:52,936 --> 00:49:55,666
I really like you, Akash.

699
00:49:57,374 --> 00:49:59,274
I like you too, Mrs. Khanna.

700
00:50:10,754 --> 00:50:16,317
+6 1. I missed your call again,
Mrs. Khanna.

701
00:50:16,894 --> 00:50:22,764
But that's okay.
We won't stay apart for long now.

702
00:50:24,468 --> 00:50:27,631
It'll be just me,
and my Mrs. Khanna.

703
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:31,030
An unsuccessful Samir. .

704
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:34,905
. . is returning
as a successful Samir.

705
00:50:55,850 --> 00:51:09,457
''I will break. .
the promise of love. ''

706
00:51:11,899 --> 00:51:20,739
''How could. . how could. .
how could you imagine that?

707
00:51:22,343 --> 00:51:36,656
''I'll ever be upset. .
or go away. . from you. ''

708
00:51:38,526 --> 00:51:47,264
''How could. . how could. .
how could you imagine that?

709
00:51:57,211 --> 00:52:02,615
''The promise. . of love. ''

710
00:52:12,793 --> 00:52:19,699
''I'll never forget you,
sweetheart. ''

711
00:52:21,135 --> 00:52:27,506
''I'll never love you any less. ''

712
00:52:29,243 --> 00:52:35,705
''You've always been dear to me. ''

713
00:52:37,318 --> 00:52:43,780
''Even if I have to lay down
my life for it. ''

714
00:52:44,725 --> 00:52:52,928
''I'll always fulfill every
promise I made to you. ''

715
00:52:55,236 --> 00:53:08,809
''I'll ever leave you. .
stranded midway. ''

716
00:53:11,552 --> 00:53:25,592
''I'll ever. . fall for anyone. .
other than you. ''

717
00:53:27,635 --> 00:53:36,304
''How could. . how could. .
how could you imagine that?

718
00:53:36,544 --> 00:53:44,747
''How could. . how could. .
how could you imagine that?

719
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:53,952
Samir.

720
00:53:55,396 --> 00:53:56,863
Where is he? Is he back?

721
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:06,137
Akash, you were sleeping
on the floor?

722
00:54:07,174 --> 00:54:08,869
I couldn't sleep up there.

723
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,911
Mrs. Khanna, my back's gone sore.

724
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:19,248
You know, last night
you were so drunk. .

725
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:21,285
. .that you lost your senses.

726
00:54:22,289 --> 00:54:24,587
And, I felt it wasn't right
to leave you alone. .

727
00:54:24,725 --> 00:54:25,885
. . in such a condition.

728
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,622
I don't know why I felt that
Samir has returned.

729
00:54:28,696 --> 00:54:29,924
Samir has returned.

730
00:54:30,164 --> 00:54:32,359
But, as I opened my eyes
I realizsed it was a dream.

731
00:54:34,268 --> 00:54:35,496
Thankfully, it was a dream.

732
00:54:35,669 --> 00:54:37,603
But, Mrs. Khanna if
it would've been true. .

733
00:54:38,272 --> 00:54:43,574
. .I would be lying somewhere else,
and not on the floor.

734
00:54:44,578 --> 00:54:45,943
Sorry, Akash.

735
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:48,705
You had to sleep all night
on the floor because of me.

736
00:54:48,983 --> 00:54:50,541
That's okay, Mrs. Khanna.

737
00:54:50,618 --> 00:54:53,519
I'll give you a chance
to repay this favour.

738
00:54:54,789 --> 00:54:56,950
Mrs. Khanna, I'll leave now.

739
00:54:57,491 --> 00:54:59,356
Arsh must be awake now.

740
00:54:59,693 --> 00:55:01,593
And, when that scoundrel
will find out. .

741
00:55:01,662 --> 00:55:05,359
. .that we spent the first day
of the year talking about Samir. .

742
00:55:05,499 --> 00:55:07,694
. . he's going to have
a hearty laugh.

743
00:55:11,338 --> 00:55:13,238
You take care. Bye.

744
00:55:24,952 --> 00:55:26,681
There is new year sale going on.

745
00:55:26,821 --> 00:55:29,881
Great discount and very good prices.

746
00:55:30,257 --> 00:55:31,747
Come. - Yes, great.

747
00:55:31,926 --> 00:55:34,224
There's no problem.
You can look around the shop.

748
00:55:34,295 --> 00:55:35,455
No problem. - Thanks.

749
00:55:35,529 --> 00:55:36,723
Thank you very much.

750
00:55:36,797 --> 00:55:38,890
Excuse me, Mr. Victor - Yes.

751
00:55:38,966 --> 00:55:40,228
This is a regular check up.

752
00:55:40,301 --> 00:55:42,496
And we believe you have an
Indian working here.

753
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:44,197
Does she have a work permit?

754
00:55:44,271 --> 00:55:46,262
Can I see her work permission?

755
00:55:46,874 --> 00:55:48,171
Raina.

756
00:55:49,777 --> 00:55:52,177
Akash, something's going on there.

757
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:05,125
Oh, he's her permit.
- Congratulations.

758
00:56:05,926 --> 00:56:07,757
Congratulations.

759
00:56:09,763 --> 00:56:11,424
What happened?

760
00:56:12,933 --> 00:56:14,594
I'll tell you.

761
00:56:24,478 --> 00:56:26,810
No, I cannot do this.

762
00:56:28,382 --> 00:56:30,873
We don't have any other option.

763
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:39,420
Raina you do want to work here,
live here don't you?

764
00:56:39,493 --> 00:56:41,427
Till Samir returns?

765
00:56:41,495 --> 00:56:42,894
Then you'll have to go
to the court. .

766
00:56:42,963 --> 00:56:46,160
. .to fill up this
phoney marriage application.

767
00:56:48,536 --> 00:56:51,198
I think Victor is right
for the first time.

768
00:56:51,305 --> 00:56:54,365
Raina I know
it's very difficult for you. .

769
00:56:54,408 --> 00:56:58,344
It's not about the difficulty,
it's absolutely wrong.

770
00:57:03,384 --> 00:57:06,547
I agree. I think Raina is right.

771
00:57:07,354 --> 00:57:08,651
How can you agree with her?

772
00:57:08,722 --> 00:57:10,121
You're Raina's friend, aren't you?

773
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:12,420
I told you that Raina's work
permit is about expire.

774
00:57:12,493 --> 00:57:15,428
Now she can't get work permit
on Samir's name.

775
00:57:15,496 --> 00:57:18,226
Won't you help her
in this difficult time?

776
00:57:19,667 --> 00:57:21,635
Raina it's your decision now.

777
00:57:21,702 --> 00:57:24,466
Akash is doing it
only for your benefit.

778
00:57:30,177 --> 00:57:31,906
I need some time to think.

779
00:57:32,146 --> 00:57:34,774
Raina, you don't
have the time to think.

780
00:57:35,516 --> 00:57:39,919
Don't worry. It's just a procedure
to buy you some time.

781
00:57:40,154 --> 00:57:41,781
That's all.

782
00:57:42,756 --> 00:57:45,623
Raina, will I ever let you
do something. .

783
00:57:45,693 --> 00:57:47,354
. .that will hurt you?

784
00:57:48,462 --> 00:57:51,488
Don't worry, Raina we're with you.

785
00:58:13,153 --> 00:58:15,713
Mrs. Khanna,
that's the queue for divorce.

786
00:58:16,323 --> 00:58:17,881
The queue for marriage
applications is there.

787
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:20,821
But do remember this queue.
You might need it sometime.

788
00:58:20,894 --> 00:58:22,361
Shut up.

789
00:58:24,298 --> 00:58:27,267
Everything will be fine between us.
- Thank you, Mrs. Khanna.

790
00:58:27,334 --> 00:58:30,326
I didn't mean you.
I was talking about me and Samir.

791
00:58:31,872 --> 00:58:34,340
I didn't understand one thing,
Akash.

792
00:58:34,575 --> 00:58:36,702
I'm doing this
because I'm helpless. .

793
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:38,878
. . but you're a bachelor.

794
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,740
Won't you feel awkward. .

795
00:58:43,384 --> 00:58:45,352
. .signing on the marriage register?

796
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:49,878
I don't believe
on these pieces of paper. - Then?

797
00:58:50,924 --> 00:58:53,950
I believe in love marriage
and not arranged marriage.

798
00:58:57,164 --> 00:58:58,961
There are many arranged marriages. .

799
00:58:59,533 --> 00:59:01,831
. .that have turned into love.

800
00:59:04,738 --> 00:59:07,298
And those that don't,
end up ruining their lives. .

801
00:59:07,408 --> 00:59:09,638
. .as well of others.

802
00:59:11,178 --> 00:59:13,544
How can you say that so confidently?

803
00:59:14,915 --> 00:59:17,509
My parents had an arranged marriage.

804
00:59:17,818 --> 00:59:19,217
They were among those people. .

805
00:59:19,286 --> 00:59:20,913
. .who couldn't turn it into love.

806
00:59:21,221 --> 00:59:22,848
And wanted to separate.

807
00:59:23,357 --> 00:59:26,690
But the family advised them
to start a family. .

808
00:59:26,827 --> 00:59:28,454
. .and, everything will be right.

809
00:59:29,463 --> 00:59:31,260
Nothing went right, Mrs. Khanna.

810
00:59:31,632 --> 00:59:33,896
Some years later, they got divorced.

811
00:59:37,671 --> 00:59:40,139
I loved them both equally.

812
00:59:40,441 --> 00:59:42,909
That's why I couldn't live
with just one of them.

813
00:59:44,945 --> 00:59:48,244
So, I came to Australia.

814
00:59:50,417 --> 00:59:54,285
I'm sorry, Akash.
- No, Mrs. Khanna.

815
00:59:54,455 --> 00:59:57,424
Those who learns from other's
mistake are the smart ones.

816
00:59:57,491 --> 01:00:00,460
Only love can keep
two people together, Mrs. Khanna. .

817
01:00:00,627 --> 01:00:02,390
. .and not this agreement.

818
01:00:03,363 --> 01:00:07,356
Akash, anyone that marries you
will be very happy.

819
01:00:08,802 --> 01:00:10,736
For now, are you happy Mrs. Khanna?

820
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:16,542
Shall we go?

821
01:00:26,687 --> 01:00:29,554
Lust at first sight
has turned into love.

822
01:00:30,457 --> 01:00:31,651
What can I do?

823
01:00:31,725 --> 01:00:33,249
Raina is that kind of a girl.

824
01:00:33,327 --> 01:00:34,589
Anyone can fall in love with her.

825
01:00:34,661 --> 01:00:36,891
What are you waiting for you,
tell her that.

826
01:00:37,331 --> 01:00:39,322
Mr. Khanna's confusion
is increasing.

827
01:00:39,633 --> 01:00:41,328
What if he come back?

828
01:00:41,802 --> 01:00:43,235
Two coffees. - Yes boss. - You !

829
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:44,532
Why you. . - Forget it.

830
01:00:44,571 --> 01:00:46,436
Give it, why. .

831
01:00:47,841 --> 01:00:49,399
Sit.

832
01:00:50,244 --> 01:00:51,905
Two coffee, please. - Yes.

833
01:00:53,914 --> 01:00:57,611
Take my advice, and tell Raina. .

834
01:00:57,684 --> 01:00:59,174
. .that you love her.

835
01:00:59,486 --> 01:01:02,785
I'm scared
if I tell her my feeling for her. .

836
01:01:03,157 --> 01:01:04,681
. .and Mrs. Khanna gets angry.

837
01:01:04,758 --> 01:01:06,487
I don't want to lose her friendship.

838
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,495
Oh, so that's what's been going on.

839
01:01:10,464 --> 01:01:12,227
You love Raina.

840
01:01:13,667 --> 01:01:15,828
Yes, he loves Raina.

841
01:01:16,103 --> 01:01:18,901
But, please keep your mouth shut
till he proposes.

842
01:01:19,106 --> 01:01:20,801
Please.
- I've nothing to lose.

843
01:01:20,841 --> 01:01:22,741
As if it matters to me.

844
01:01:23,577 --> 01:01:27,673
But at least tell the one
this matter is concerned about.

845
01:01:28,916 --> 01:01:30,816
I am going, duffers.

846
01:01:33,153 --> 01:01:34,916
She's right.
- Are we duffers?

847
01:01:35,155 --> 01:01:37,214
No, I should tell Raina.

848
01:01:37,424 --> 01:01:39,358
That's being a man.

849
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,560
You know,
Raina should have this choice. .

850
01:01:43,297 --> 01:01:48,132
. .whether she wants a selfish,
self-centred. .

851
01:01:48,202 --> 01:01:50,830
. .self-obsessed husband. .

852
01:01:51,271 --> 01:01:53,637
. . like Samir or a kind-hearted man
like you.

853
01:01:54,641 --> 01:01:55,801
You're right.

854
01:02:00,347 --> 01:02:02,144
God, I'm so happy for Raina.

855
01:02:02,349 --> 01:02:05,113
Do you know what a girl looks
for in a man?

856
01:02:05,352 --> 01:02:07,479
He should be good looking,
which you are.

857
01:02:08,088 --> 01:02:09,885
Should have a good body,
rough and tough.

858
01:02:10,123 --> 01:02:11,522
You have that.

859
01:02:12,593 --> 01:02:14,527
He should have a job,
and you do work as a waiter.

860
01:02:14,595 --> 01:02:16,392
And the most important thing.

861
01:02:17,097 --> 01:02:19,565
He should have a good backing,
a good support.

862
01:02:19,633 --> 01:02:20,759
And, I'm there for that.

863
01:02:20,834 --> 01:02:23,200
I'll always be behind you.

864
01:02:23,437 --> 01:02:25,302
Raina can't refuse.

865
01:02:25,439 --> 01:02:26,736
Go ahead and say it.

866
01:02:37,217 --> 01:02:38,275
Now, her choice is clear.

867
01:02:38,352 --> 01:02:41,412
You. Yes, only you. Just do it.

868
01:02:41,588 --> 01:02:42,850
Excuse me.

869
01:02:42,923 --> 01:02:45,448
What terminal does
Tia Roberts work at?

870
01:02:46,393 --> 01:02:48,827
Tia never told us she has
such a handsome boyfriend.

871
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:51,391
She must be around, she'll be here.

872
01:02:53,734 --> 01:02:56,168
Your name?
- Samir.

873
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:07,870
Khanna.

874
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,387
Samir Khanna.

875
01:03:16,356 --> 01:03:22,625
And you are?
- She's Nina, Raina's best friend.

876
01:03:29,303 --> 01:03:31,498
All your wishes are fulfilled.

877
01:03:32,673 --> 01:03:34,868
He has come for you.

878
01:03:35,475 --> 01:03:37,875
And you know,
I always thought you're crazy.

879
01:03:37,945 --> 01:03:39,810
Because, you're waiting for someone. .

880
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,575
. .who never belonged to you.

881
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:44,942
But, I guess I was wrong.

882
01:03:45,886 --> 01:03:48,855
I just saw how much he loves you.

883
01:03:48,922 --> 01:03:53,757
Where is Samir?
- Samir is waiting for you. .

884
01:03:54,461 --> 01:03:55,792
. .where you two had separated.

885
01:03:55,862 --> 01:04:02,324
''What's gone wrong in this journey?''

886
01:04:02,569 --> 01:04:09,338
''The efforts are mine, but the
destination belongs only to you. ''

887
01:04:09,576 --> 01:04:16,311
''With a heart filled
with sorrow of separation. . ''

888
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:21,821
''. .I'll search for you once again
on the same path. ''

889
01:04:21,888 --> 01:04:25,255
''Everything seems forlorn
without you. ''

890
01:04:25,325 --> 01:04:28,556
''Without you,
the world seems forlorn. ''

891
01:04:28,628 --> 01:04:31,927
''My eyes search for you. ''

892
01:04:32,165 --> 01:04:36,192
''Don't leave me alone like this. ''

893
01:04:44,945 --> 01:04:46,378
I'm back.

894
01:05:20,914 --> 01:05:23,940
Victor sir, this is my husband Samir.
- So good to see you.

895
01:05:24,184 --> 01:05:26,414
I see. Come on, shake hands.
Give me a hug.

896
01:05:26,787 --> 01:05:27,947
God bless you.

897
01:05:28,188 --> 01:05:29,815
I've heard a lot
about you on the phone.

898
01:05:29,956 --> 01:05:32,254
And Samir, this is Tia.

899
01:05:33,193 --> 01:05:36,185
She. . - I know,
you don't need to say anything.

900
01:05:36,396 --> 01:05:39,593
Tia, whenever you're in trouble. .

901
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,801
. .I'll be the first one
to extend my hand. - Thank you.

902
01:05:45,372 --> 01:05:47,806
And Samir, he's Akash.

903
01:05:49,743 --> 01:05:51,370
My very good friend.

904
01:05:51,545 --> 01:05:53,376
I met him a while ago.

905
01:05:55,582 --> 01:06:01,612
Raina. Are they related to us? No.

906
01:06:02,622 --> 01:06:05,386
Who are they to us? No one.

907
01:06:06,893 --> 01:06:09,361
But still, they helped you out.

908
01:06:10,263 --> 01:06:13,858
They belong to another world,
another time era.

909
01:06:14,901 --> 01:06:18,837
And, they've mistakenly come
to this world, and this era.

910
01:06:19,172 --> 01:06:21,436
Is he praising us, or insulting us?

911
01:06:22,876 --> 01:06:24,468
Thank you very much.

912
01:06:26,646 --> 01:06:30,377
I. . I'm Arsh,
a good friend of Akash.

913
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,446
Come on, guys.

914
01:06:34,588 --> 01:06:35,850
Do you wish to stay here?

915
01:06:35,922 --> 01:06:37,253
I've called for a taxi.

916
01:06:37,324 --> 01:06:38,416
Let's take Samir home.

917
01:06:38,492 --> 01:06:40,323
Of course,
Samir must be really tired.

918
01:06:40,393 --> 01:06:41,451
It's important for him to rest.

919
01:06:41,528 --> 01:06:42,893
Take him home.

920
01:06:42,963 --> 01:06:45,488
Thank you. - Come on.
- Thank you. Thanks.

921
01:06:45,899 --> 01:06:47,389
Big trouble!

922
01:06:49,469 --> 01:06:50,697
Bye.

923
01:06:51,304 --> 01:06:53,704
Indian woman. . husband says, sorry. .

924
01:06:53,773 --> 01:06:55,707
. .and all the differences are over.

925
01:06:56,276 --> 01:06:59,268
If they live together again,
and alone.

926
01:06:59,479 --> 01:07:02,414
Then you can consider your
love story finished.

927
01:07:02,616 --> 01:07:04,550
Then, will he live with us?

928
01:07:09,789 --> 01:07:11,347
Idea ! Tia.

929
01:07:25,539 --> 01:07:27,234
How do you like our home?

930
01:07:30,944 --> 01:07:32,434
Little Raina.

931
01:07:34,581 --> 01:07:37,482
That couldn't make her
own decision.

932
01:07:37,784 --> 01:07:43,245
I find this house. .
a little too big for her.

933
01:07:45,659 --> 01:07:47,684
You look beautiful.

934
01:07:49,362 --> 01:07:51,557
Have you forgotten your answer?

935
01:07:52,199 --> 01:07:54,827
That I look beautiful to you
at any place and any time.

936
01:07:54,901 --> 01:07:56,664
Beautiful.

937
01:07:58,605 --> 01:08:00,664
But that's beside the point right.

938
01:08:00,774 --> 01:08:02,332
Right.

939
01:08:05,779 --> 01:08:07,406
Come closer.

940
01:08:09,416 --> 01:08:10,610
Here.

941
01:08:11,418 --> 01:08:13,215
You're always ready.

942
01:08:18,792 --> 01:08:21,693
Thanks, for being with me.

943
01:08:24,864 --> 01:08:27,162
I haven't done all this alone.

944
01:08:27,734 --> 01:08:31,329
Akash was the one
that solved my problems.

945
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:36,173
This Akash seems to be
a very nice person. - Doesn't he?

946
01:08:36,376 --> 01:08:39,436
I was slightly confused myself,
when I first met him.

947
01:08:39,713 --> 01:08:43,513
But now I feel there's no other
in this world like Akash.

948
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:48,754
I've made everything right.

949
01:08:50,624 --> 01:08:52,319
I've come back for you.

950
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:56,258
To our house, our own house.

951
01:08:56,529 --> 01:08:58,224
And, not a rented one.

952
01:08:58,965 --> 01:09:00,865
You will come along with me,
won't you?

953
01:09:07,107 --> 01:09:08,734
I love you.

954
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:11,268
Good evening.

955
01:09:11,344 --> 01:09:14,404
Yes, I need a reservation
for Raina Khanna. .

956
01:09:14,481 --> 01:09:18,815
. .from Melbourne to Singapore, on. .
Friday.

957
01:09:23,923 --> 01:09:25,185
Tia.

958
01:09:28,528 --> 01:09:30,189
What's wrong, Tia?

959
01:09:34,234 --> 01:09:39,137
Tia's landlord threw Tia
out of her own house.

960
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:43,368
Tia is homeless now.

961
01:09:43,943 --> 01:09:46,741
Tia is helpless now.

962
01:09:48,348 --> 01:09:50,407
Tia, what are you saying?

963
01:09:50,483 --> 01:09:53,577
My Julia Roberts. .
I mean, my Tia Roberts. .

964
01:09:53,653 --> 01:09:56,315
. .when you have friends like us,
how can you be homeless?

965
01:09:56,389 --> 01:09:57,720
Just shut up, Arsh.

966
01:09:57,791 --> 01:09:59,884
Raina they've gone mad.

967
01:10:03,697 --> 01:10:04,891
Samir.

968
01:10:05,899 --> 01:10:08,493
Just look,
Samir she's such a strange girl.

969
01:10:08,568 --> 01:10:09,899
We're trying to help her. .

970
01:10:10,136 --> 01:10:11,433
. .and she's getting angry on us.

971
01:10:11,504 --> 01:10:12,801
I don't understand that either.

972
01:10:12,906 --> 01:10:14,100
She should be happy.

973
01:10:14,207 --> 01:10:15,731
Are you two crazy?

974
01:10:16,376 --> 01:10:18,367
How can beautiful and young Tia. .

975
01:10:18,611 --> 01:10:20,545
. .sleep between the two of you?

976
01:10:21,614 --> 01:10:22,808
What's the problem?

977
01:10:23,416 --> 01:10:25,145
You can sleep on the side.

978
01:10:26,252 --> 01:10:27,810
Arsh can sleep in the middle.

979
01:10:27,887 --> 01:10:31,516
Oh, no I won't sleep in the middle.
- Why?

980
01:10:32,659 --> 01:10:34,524
I keep tossing on the bed.

981
01:10:36,329 --> 01:10:37,819
Sometimes on this side.

982
01:10:38,798 --> 01:10:40,663
And at times, on this side.

983
01:10:41,468 --> 01:10:42,833
You do understand, don't you?

984
01:10:43,169 --> 01:10:44,363
One position is dangerous for me.

985
01:10:44,471 --> 01:10:46,632
And the other one is dangerous
for her.

986
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,808
Depending,
who's sleeping on which side?

987
01:10:49,142 --> 01:10:50,575
What?

988
01:10:55,482 --> 01:10:58,144
Insolent.
Is that how you talk to Samir?

989
01:10:58,218 --> 01:11:00,948
Then tell Samir to let Tia
stay with him and Raina.

990
01:11:01,287 --> 01:11:02,447
Don't mind me.

991
01:11:02,522 --> 01:11:05,685
I'm very upset seeing
my friend in this condition.

992
01:11:23,309 --> 01:11:26,369
It's not easy to find friends
like you two in this era.

993
01:11:28,214 --> 01:11:31,377
Raina, Tia can stay with you.

994
01:11:34,521 --> 01:11:36,614
I can sleep between these two.
- What?

995
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:38,789
Poor Raina.

996
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:41,593
She's neither with Samir
nor with you.

997
01:11:42,295 --> 01:11:44,593
Why do you get so nervous
in front of her?

998
01:11:44,664 --> 01:11:48,156
Since he has arrived in Raina's
and my life, I can't think. .

999
01:11:48,234 --> 01:11:49,462
Just a minute.

1000
01:11:49,536 --> 01:11:52,164
He came into your life?
Or did you come in their life?

1001
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:54,331
Are you my friend or his?
- I'm your friend.

1002
01:11:54,374 --> 01:11:55,898
What kind of a friend?
- It's not my fault

1003
01:11:56,176 --> 01:11:59,145
Everything I did was to create
differences between these two.

1004
01:11:59,212 --> 01:12:01,237
I didn't know he'll sleep
between the two of us.

1005
01:12:01,314 --> 01:12:04,875
Come in.
- Coming. We're coming.

1006
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:10,089
Listen.
Go inside and talk in riddles.

1007
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:11,348
He should feel there's something. .

1008
01:12:11,424 --> 01:12:13,722
. . between you and Raina. .
- Is there something or not?

1009
01:12:13,793 --> 01:12:16,125
There is, there is.

1010
01:12:16,296 --> 01:12:17,524
Make him doubt. Doubt.

1011
01:12:17,597 --> 01:12:20,225
There's a cure for everything
in this world, but not for doubts.

1012
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:21,528
Even NASA doesn't have it.

1013
01:12:21,601 --> 01:12:23,432
Come on my tiger. Come on.

1014
01:12:24,604 --> 01:12:26,299
Get ready. Come on.

1015
01:12:28,341 --> 01:12:33,472
Come on.

1016
01:12:33,813 --> 01:12:36,145
Shall I?
- Come on.

1017
01:12:36,216 --> 01:12:37,877
Oh God, help me!

1018
01:12:42,222 --> 01:12:43,519
Thank you.

1019
01:12:44,724 --> 01:12:47,249
Samir, are you comfortable?

1020
01:12:47,327 --> 01:12:49,158
Why this formality.
You can address me normally.

1021
01:12:49,229 --> 01:12:50,594
Everything you've done for Raina. .

1022
01:12:50,663 --> 01:12:52,324
That was my duty.

1023
01:12:53,132 --> 01:12:57,159
Duty? Duties are mostly
in relationships.

1024
01:12:57,337 --> 01:13:00,738
And a relationship should
always have a name. - Yes.

1025
01:13:01,441 --> 01:13:04,308
What could possibly be
your relation with Raina?

1026
01:13:05,912 --> 01:13:08,472
Are you her uncle?
- No.

1027
01:13:09,282 --> 01:13:11,375
I am her maternal uncle.
- No.

1028
01:13:12,886 --> 01:13:14,581
Brother?
- No.

1029
01:13:15,355 --> 01:13:17,152
Only friends?
- No, no.

1030
01:13:17,223 --> 01:13:19,691
No, we did this good deed
on the grounds of humanity.

1031
01:13:19,759 --> 01:13:21,886
We did this good deed,
and forgot about it.

1032
01:13:23,329 --> 01:13:25,320
Then, you really are
a very kind-hearted man.

1033
01:13:25,398 --> 01:13:26,888
You two are great.

1034
01:13:27,967 --> 01:13:29,594
Would you two like to hear a story?

1035
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:33,302
Fine, we aren't
feeling sleepy anyway.

1036
01:13:33,673 --> 01:13:36,335
A few years back in Dalhousie. .

1037
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:38,677
. . Raina was eating chocolate. .

1038
01:13:38,745 --> 01:13:40,906
. .and she threw the wrapper
on the ground.

1039
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:42,971
A man approached her,
he was the worker of that place.

1040
01:13:43,249 --> 01:13:44,273
And he said.

1041
01:13:44,350 --> 01:13:46,875
''Madam, keep India clean''.

1042
01:13:48,488 --> 01:13:50,422
Raina was very impressed by him. .

1043
01:13:50,557 --> 01:13:55,324
. .and started talking to him,
everyday, sweetly, decently.

1044
01:13:55,762 --> 01:14:00,495
But that poor worker,
he had a little misunderstanding.

1045
01:14:01,334 --> 01:14:05,270
That worker thought that Raina
has fallen in love with him.

1046
01:14:05,371 --> 01:14:06,633
How awkward !

1047
01:14:06,673 --> 01:14:08,538
The worker?
- Yes.

1048
01:14:09,342 --> 01:14:10,639
By the way, what do you two do?

1049
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:12,901
I'm a bartender.
- Bartender.

1050
01:14:13,146 --> 01:14:14,272
And then?

1051
01:14:14,347 --> 01:14:15,712
His very tender.

1052
01:14:15,782 --> 01:14:17,181
Okay. - You get everyone drunk.

1053
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:19,411
Get me drunk as well at time.
- Sure.

1054
01:14:20,687 --> 01:14:22,587
And, what after the people leave?

1055
01:14:22,789 --> 01:14:24,689
After they leave? Nothing.

1056
01:14:24,891 --> 01:14:26,916
Cleaning the glasses,
clearing the tables.

1057
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,684
Cleaning up. .

1058
01:14:32,365 --> 01:14:35,493
It's the same job. Same to same.

1059
01:14:36,469 --> 01:14:37,595
Same to same.

1060
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:39,900
What? - Worker.

1061
01:14:40,206 --> 01:14:42,606
Yes. - Nothing, Good night.

1062
01:14:42,675 --> 01:14:44,575
You two are really modest.

1063
01:14:44,644 --> 01:14:46,612
Hey you. .
- Good night.

1064
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:51,808
Open.

1065
01:14:51,884 --> 01:14:54,978
Samir. Samir.

1066
01:14:55,989 --> 01:14:58,321
Samir.

1067
01:14:58,591 --> 01:15:00,889
Brother, don't do this to me.

1068
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,292
Come out quickly,
or else I'll wet my pants.

1069
01:15:03,496 --> 01:15:05,794
Samir.

1070
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,158
Oh God.

1071
01:15:09,736 --> 01:15:14,435
Scoundrel. He's doing this to us
in our own house.

1072
01:15:14,474 --> 01:15:16,738
Your competitor is really smart.

1073
01:15:17,477 --> 01:15:19,809
Last night he made us workers.

1074
01:15:21,214 --> 01:15:22,374
We'll have to do something.

1075
01:15:22,448 --> 01:15:24,416
We'll have to do something big.
- What?

1076
01:15:24,484 --> 01:15:26,952
So that you look like the hero and he
looks like a fool in front of Raina.

1077
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:28,480
Have you noticed his personality?

1078
01:15:28,554 --> 01:15:29,714
And take a look at us.

1079
01:15:29,889 --> 01:15:31,720
Let's get him drunk.

1080
01:15:31,791 --> 01:15:32,849
What good will that do?

1081
01:15:32,925 --> 01:15:36,156
And then, we'll have
some girl seduce him.

1082
01:15:37,196 --> 01:15:38,925
And then, we'll tell Raina
''Look, your husband. . ''

1083
01:15:39,165 --> 01:15:41,156
''. . is a rogue,
and is characterless. . ''.

1084
01:15:42,368 --> 01:15:44,393
You're such a scoundrel.
- Thank you.

1085
01:15:44,504 --> 01:15:46,665
But, who will be the girl?
- Haseena.

1086
01:15:46,806 --> 01:15:49,900
Haseena?
- Haseena Jagmagia from Pakistan.

1087
01:16:08,194 --> 01:16:11,163
Moments will have to pass by.

1088
01:16:12,865 --> 01:16:15,561
The storm will have to pass away.

1089
01:16:15,868 --> 01:16:19,360
I'm just a thought, let me go.

1090
01:16:19,639 --> 01:16:21,869
No one can hold thoughts.

1091
01:16:22,442 --> 01:16:23,534
Wow.

1092
01:16:25,878 --> 01:16:28,244

here to meet you.

Greetings.

Haseena, we had a very
important work with you.

1099
01:17:14,527 --> 01:17:16,791
Actually,
Haseena never meets anyone. .

1100
01:17:16,863 --> 01:17:18,626
. .without an appointment.

1101
01:17:19,866 --> 01:17:22,460
No, we were talking about you
and no one else.

1102
01:17:22,535 --> 01:17:23,661
You two are so stupid.

1103
01:17:23,736 --> 01:17:27,536
Don't you know that the
world addresses her as Haseena?

1104
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:31,343
Yes, but she just said
that we need an appointment. .

1105
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:32,502
. .to meet Haseena,
so I thought. .

. .she's talking about some
other woman. I am sorry.

1107
01:17:34,614 --> 01:17:38,243
I think you're not well-versed
with my way of speaking.

1108
01:17:38,317 --> 01:17:41,445
Haseena, pardon this insolent man.

1109
01:17:41,521 --> 01:17:43,318
He doesn't know about your grandeur.

1110
01:17:43,389 --> 01:17:44,583
But, I am.

1111
01:17:46,659 --> 01:17:49,924

He's a very stubborn man. .

to my performance.

Don't trouble me. - Oh, my God !
I shouldn't trouble him.

Why did you have to drink so much?

1200
01:24:56,422 --> 01:24:58,185
Instead of Raina,
you went after that Haseena.

1201

Leave someone for me.

1202
01:25:00,659 --> 01:25:02,183
There's nothing you can do.

1203

No one can do you any harm.

What are you saying?

1215
01:25:37,162 --> 01:25:39,255
It's a letter,
from the registrar office.

There's a small surprise for you.

The surprise is. . I've bought
a star for you from NASA.

1222
01:26:09,762 --> 01:26:13,198
For you.
- I don't want another star.

1223
01:26:14,633 --> 01:26:18,433
If there's anything I want,
it's you Samir.

1224
01:26:18,871 --> 01:26:20,839
A junior Samir.

1225
01:26:22,374 --> 01:26:24,205
Since when did you get so humorous?

1226
01:26:25,644 --> 01:26:27,373
Since you became so romantic.

1227
01:26:27,446 --> 01:26:30,677
Wow! Fantastic.
My wife has become smart.

1228
01:26:30,883 --> 01:26:33,408

01:26:40,225 --> 01:26:41,783
Tonight, you're in trouble.

1232
01:26:42,194 --> 01:26:44,958
There's delay but not deny.

1233
01:26:45,197 --> 01:26:47,893
Champagne, four bottles please.

I'll take a quick shower.

1236
01:27:02,648 --> 01:27:03,842
Can I come?

1237
01:27:06,118 --> 01:27:07,608
Only ten minutes.

1238

I'm waiting for you on this couch.

1239
01:27:10,189 --> 01:27:11,349
Hurry up

1240
01:27:13,592 --> 01:27:17,494
Oh. . Raina, this couch
is really small for the two of us.

1241
01:27:17,563 --> 01:27:19,724
I'll wait for you in the bedroom.

1242
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:36,175
Raina.
- Yes.

1243
01:27:36,682 --> 01:27:39,276
There's a mail for you.
- Who can send me a mail. .

1244
01:27:39,351 --> 01:27:40,648
. .other than you?

1245
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:42,346
Why don't you see who is it from?

1246
01:27:42,554 --> 01:27:44,852
I don't want to see mail, but you.

1247
01:27:44,923 --> 01:27:48,222
Stop it, Samir.
- Okay.

1248
01:27:49,728 --> 01:27:52,253
You still use my perfume.

1249
01:27:52,931 --> 01:27:54,398
Of course.

1250
01:28:07,279 --> 01:28:10,737
You were going to wait for me
in the bedroom.

1251
01:28:11,350 --> 01:28:13,284
Why are you sitting in the kitchen?

1252
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:17,484
What did you do here
while waiting for me?

1253
01:28:19,425 --> 01:28:20,551
What can I say?

1254
01:28:21,727 --> 01:28:23,661
Tia helped me a lot.

1255
01:28:24,296 --> 01:28:26,161
Nina supported me.

1256
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:31,631
And Akash. .
- And, Akash?

1257
01:28:31,870 --> 01:28:33,735
He's an angel.

1258
01:28:40,579 --> 01:28:42,376
You told me about everyone. .

1259
01:28:42,648 --> 01:28:47,676
. . but this angel Akash who's
really important in your life.

1260
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,385
You didn't tell me
anything about him.

1261
01:28:51,657 --> 01:28:53,591
Why are you saying that, Samir?

1262
01:28:58,697 --> 01:29:04,499
You. .went to the court
to get married to Akash.

1263
01:29:06,505 --> 01:29:08,336
When did you expect to tell me that?

1264
01:29:08,507 --> 01:29:10,202
After the marriage?

1265
01:29:11,310 --> 01:29:12,834
You didn't have the time?

1266
01:29:15,314 --> 01:29:16,713
Don't give me that.

1267
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:22,584
You couldn't tell me,
or you didn't want to tell me.

1268
01:29:24,389 --> 01:29:29,122
Since I've arrived, I'm sleeping
in someone else's bedroom.

1269
01:29:30,796 --> 01:29:34,129
You and your friend were trying
to set me up. .

1270
01:29:34,199 --> 01:29:37,635
. .with an unknown girl.
- Do you doubt me?

1271
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:40,738
Raina, if I had any doubts. .

1272
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:43,331
. .I wouldn't have been here
at this moment.

1273
01:29:43,408 --> 01:29:44,602
What could I have told you?

1274
01:29:44,943 --> 01:29:46,638
That I'm getting falsely married
to Akash. .

1275
01:29:46,712 --> 01:29:48,942
. . because I need a work permit,
Samir.

1276
01:29:50,449 --> 01:29:51,711
Work permit.

1277
01:29:56,722 --> 01:29:59,657
Raina, I'm your husband.

1278
01:30:01,326 --> 01:30:02,725
You could've told me.

1279
01:30:03,195 --> 01:30:06,562
You should have told me.
- Really?

1280
01:30:07,633 --> 01:30:09,794
Now you know that I'm your wife.

1281
01:30:10,636 --> 01:30:12,194
Where were you, when I was trying. .

1282
01:30:12,237 --> 01:30:13,795
. .to manage everything here alone?

1283
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:16,437
You weren't there, Samir.

1284
01:30:16,508 --> 01:30:18,135
Akash helped me.

1285
01:30:19,845 --> 01:30:21,836
It's really easy
to ask questions, Samir.

1286
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:25,479
But I did what
I felt was right at that moment.

1287
01:30:26,785 --> 01:30:28,912
You did what you felt was right.

1288
01:30:33,191 --> 01:30:34,920
You know, I have a suggestion.

1289
01:30:35,561 --> 01:30:39,497
Because, I'm never around you,
never spend time with you.

1290
01:30:40,299 --> 01:30:43,462
And, since Akash is here. .
new angel.

1291
01:30:44,469 --> 01:30:46,733
Go. Go to him.

1292
01:30:47,439 --> 01:30:50,374
And turn this fake marriage
into a real one.

1293
01:30:54,813 --> 01:30:56,576
This time, you decide.

1294
01:30:56,848 --> 01:30:58,543
Whether you want to come with me. .

1295
01:30:58,717 --> 01:31:00,309
. .or do you want a divorce?

1296
01:31:02,454 --> 01:31:05,480
It's not that easy
to ask such questions.

1297
01:31:06,158 --> 01:31:09,821
It's very difficult,
but if you're right. .

1298
01:31:10,362 --> 01:31:14,230
. .then give the right answer.
It's very easy.

1299
01:31:29,681 --> 01:31:35,642
''Oh Lord. Oh Lord. ''

1300
01:31:36,254 --> 01:31:41,658
''Oh Lord. Oh Lord. ''

1301
01:31:41,927 --> 01:31:45,124
''Who are you to anyone?''

1302
01:31:45,197 --> 01:31:48,291
''The weak bonds have broken. ''

1303
01:31:48,367 --> 01:31:51,268
''The heart wanders around. ''

1304
01:31:51,370 --> 01:31:54,567
''My love is no longer with me. ''

1305
01:31:54,640 --> 01:32:00,840
''Why is there still a distance?''

1306
01:32:00,912 --> 01:32:06,509
''Why are there still
these grievances?''

1307
01:32:07,753 --> 01:32:13,316
''Lord, let me know. ''

1308
01:32:13,859 --> 01:32:19,593
''Let me know, Lord. ''

1309
01:32:20,332 --> 01:32:22,800
''What should I do?''

1310
01:32:22,834 --> 01:32:26,235
''What should I do now?''

1311
01:32:26,505 --> 01:32:32,205
''Let me know, let me know Lord. ''

1312
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:58,429
''I can't live without you.
Without you. ''

1313
01:32:58,837 --> 01:33:04,434
''I can't live without you.
Without you. ''

1314
01:33:04,576 --> 01:33:09,377
''I can't live without you. ''

1315
01:33:11,616 --> 01:33:13,743
Hi, Akash.
- Yes, Mrs. Khanna.

1316
01:33:13,819 --> 01:33:16,310
Akash, I need to talk
to you urgently.

1317
01:33:17,322 --> 01:33:19,552
Is everything okay?

1318
01:33:19,624 --> 01:33:21,285
He has left home.

1319
01:33:21,359 --> 01:33:24,453
I want to meet you.
- ''I am always upset. ''

1320
01:33:26,465 --> 01:33:30,663
''Don't know what the problem is. ''

1321
01:33:32,804 --> 01:33:36,968
''I can't even laugh without you. ''

1322
01:33:39,211 --> 01:33:43,545
''Why does happiness have
an enmity with me?''

1323
01:33:45,517 --> 01:33:50,853
''My loneliness torments me. ''

1324
01:33:51,823 --> 01:33:57,455
''Your heart will be upset as well. ''

1325
01:33:58,263 --> 01:34:02,666
''I cannot live without you. ''

1326
01:34:02,868 --> 01:34:08,534
''Why is there still a distance?''

1327
01:34:12,878 --> 01:34:18,510
''Lord, let me know. ''

1328
01:34:19,151 --> 01:34:24,555
''Let me know, Lord. ''

1329
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:27,824
''What should I do?''

1330
01:34:28,193 --> 01:34:31,321
''What should I do now?''

1331
01:34:32,164 --> 01:34:37,192
''Let me know, let me know Lord. ''

1332
01:34:37,903 --> 01:34:43,773
''Oh Lord. Oh Lord. ''

1333
01:34:44,442 --> 01:34:50,176
Not good, Mr. Khanna.
- ''Oh Lord. Oh Lord. ''

1334
01:34:50,682 --> 01:34:56,416
''Oh Lord. Oh Lord. ''

1335
01:34:56,955 --> 01:35:01,415
''Oh Lord. Oh Lord. ''

1336
01:35:01,493 --> 01:35:03,188
Let's go Akash !

1337
01:35:03,395 --> 01:35:04,760
What are you thinking?

1338
01:35:05,564 --> 01:35:06,758
Nothing.

1339
01:35:07,265 --> 01:35:08,527
Let's go.

1340
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:15,165
''Oh Lord. Oh Lord. ''

1341
01:35:15,841 --> 01:35:20,278
''Oh Lord. Oh Lord. ''

1342
01:35:20,612 --> 01:35:21,840
Hi.

1343
01:35:26,218 --> 01:35:27,742
What's wrong?

1344
01:35:28,386 --> 01:35:31,378
I need to ask you
an important question, Akash.

1345
01:35:32,691 --> 01:35:34,852
You two take a seat.
I'll get you coffee.

1346
01:35:37,662 --> 01:35:39,186
Tell me, Mrs. Khanna.

1347
01:35:39,798 --> 01:35:41,629
Are we good friends?

1348
01:35:42,667 --> 01:35:45,363
Yes, we're good friends.

1349
01:35:46,905 --> 01:35:49,601
Last night,
Samir asked me some questions. .

1350
01:35:51,910 --> 01:35:54,208
. .and I didn't have
an answer for them.

1351
01:35:56,882 --> 01:35:59,510
Only you can give an answer, Akash.

1352
01:36:05,290 --> 01:36:06,484
What is it?

1353
01:36:14,132 --> 01:36:15,656
You're right, Samir.

1354
01:36:16,768 --> 01:36:19,134
I shouldn't have hidden
this thing from you.

1355
01:36:20,338 --> 01:36:25,332
But it's true, that there's nothing
between me and Akash.

1356
01:36:26,711 --> 01:36:28,576
We're just good friends.

1357
01:36:30,615 --> 01:36:33,482
So much had already happened
between us Samir. .

1358
01:36:33,952 --> 01:36:37,217
. .I didn't want anything else
to ruin our relationship.

1359
01:36:41,259 --> 01:36:42,749
I love you, Samir.

1360
01:36:43,828 --> 01:36:47,924
You're the Samir
that gave me a name. .

1361
01:36:48,266 --> 01:36:49,756
. .which God forgot to give me.

1362
01:36:52,871 --> 01:36:55,271
Akash and I are good friends.

1363
01:37:02,314 --> 01:37:07,513
All I know, that not just Samir. .

1364
01:37:09,321 --> 01:37:11,653
. . but anyone can fall in love
with you.

1365
01:37:15,327 --> 01:37:21,323
Akash is in love with you.

1366
01:37:27,138 --> 01:37:30,767
You're wrong.

1367
01:37:34,212 --> 01:37:35,804
Do you love me?

1368
01:37:36,548 --> 01:37:42,180
''The heart runs here and there. ''

1369
01:37:42,253 --> 01:37:47,418
Why just me? Anyone can fall
in love with you, Mrs. Khanna.

1370
01:37:48,259 --> 01:37:51,717
But no one can replace Samir
in your life.

1371
01:37:54,199 --> 01:37:56,793
''You dwell in my breath. ''

1372
01:37:56,868 --> 01:37:59,359
Mr. and Mrs. Khanna
are made for each other.

1373
01:38:01,506 --> 01:38:03,906
''May your dreams be fulfilled. ''

1374
01:38:04,142 --> 01:38:05,700
Thank you, Akash.

1375
01:38:06,544 --> 01:38:07,841
You helped me so much.

1376
01:38:07,912 --> 01:38:11,848
''Give me some relief
from my torments. ''

1377
01:38:11,916 --> 01:38:14,111
Maybe no one would have
done this for anyone.

1378
01:38:14,185 --> 01:38:18,451
''Can this heart find a refuge?''

1379
01:38:18,790 --> 01:38:22,191
''Why are there these differences?''

1380
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:25,696
Samir is waiting for me inside.
We're going.

1381
01:38:29,167 --> 01:38:31,362
Arsh, call everyone.

1382
01:38:32,370 --> 01:38:34,235
Mrs. Khanna is leaving us.

1383
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:42,211
''Affection drives away affection. ''

1384
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:48,480
''What kind of ritual
is this that God made?''

1385
01:38:48,553 --> 01:38:53,490
''Affection drives away affection. ''

1386
01:38:53,558 --> 01:38:54,786
Let's go, Mrs. Khanna.

1387
01:38:54,859 --> 01:39:01,958
''What kind of ritual
is this that God made?''

1388
01:39:14,779 --> 01:39:19,375
Say bye. - Bye, Akash.

1389
01:39:20,685 --> 01:39:24,348
Bye Mrs. Khanna. - Bye. - Yes.

1390
01:39:24,422 --> 01:39:25,684
Stop.

1391
01:39:26,191 --> 01:39:27,488
I'll get the bag.

1392
01:39:27,559 --> 01:39:28,753
You go inside.

1393
01:39:30,228 --> 01:39:32,594
And don't worry,
we're travelling in the same flight. .

1394
01:39:32,664 --> 01:39:34,325
. .and to the same destination.

1395
01:39:46,144 --> 01:39:47,441
Thanks.

1396
01:39:47,912 --> 01:39:49,846
It was my. . - Duty.

1397
01:39:52,884 --> 01:39:55,717
It was your duty and mine.

1398
01:39:55,954 --> 01:40:03,793
But, next time. . Khanna is fine
but. . Mrs. Khanna.

1399
01:40:05,497 --> 01:40:07,362
Try for Ms. Khanna.

1400
01:40:11,402 --> 01:40:12,801
Tried your best, didn't you?

1401
01:40:14,305 --> 01:40:16,535
Anything happened?
- I wish.

1402
01:40:16,808 --> 01:40:19,470
Akash, stay on the ground.

1403
01:40:19,544 --> 01:40:21,341
I'm going to fly in the air.

1404
01:40:21,613 --> 01:40:23,444
With my Mrs. Khanna.

1405
01:40:24,449 --> 01:40:25,814
Mr. Khanna.

1406
01:40:29,487 --> 01:40:34,322
Mrs. Khanna, never gave me a hug.
At least you give me a hug.

1407
01:40:34,659 --> 01:40:39,722
''Oh Lord. Oh Lord. ''

1408
01:40:39,797 --> 01:40:40,889
Take care.

1409
01:40:41,132 --> 01:40:46,536
''Oh Lord. Oh Lord. ''

1410
01:40:46,638 --> 01:40:48,833
Sir. .

1411
01:40:53,178 --> 01:40:56,579
Mrs. Khanna, Mr. Khanna has
sent these flowers for you.

1412
01:40:58,850 --> 01:41:01,148
Enjoy your flight. - Thank you.

1413
01:41:02,153 --> 01:41:05,816
They're really nice, Samir.
Thank you.

1414
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:10,821
But I haven't sent them.

1415
01:41:11,496 --> 01:41:13,293
Check whom they are from?

1416
01:41:18,236 --> 01:41:20,204
'Mr. Khanna, I never came across. . '

1417
01:41:20,305 --> 01:41:21,397
'. .anyone better than you. '

1418
01:41:21,506 --> 01:41:23,872
'And, I can never settle for
anyone less than you. '

1419
01:41:24,108 --> 01:41:25,234
'Lucky Samir. '

1420
01:41:25,310 --> 01:41:26,572
Akash.

1421
01:41:38,223 --> 01:41:40,214
Now, do you understand, Mrs. Khanna. .

1422
01:41:40,925 --> 01:41:43,553
. .why Akash would
call you Mrs. Khanna?

1423
01:41:45,230 --> 01:41:48,199
Look, read the surname.

1424
01:41:53,771 --> 01:41:54,829
'Hello, Mrs. Khanna. '

1425
01:41:54,939 --> 01:41:56,338
'Congratulation. Mrs. Khanna. '

1426
01:41:56,407 --> 01:41:57,465
'Hi, Mrs. Khanna. '

1427
01:41:57,542 --> 01:41:59,339
'Sorry, Mrs. Khanna. '

1428
01:41:59,410 --> 01:42:00,900
'Are you happy for now,
Mrs. Khanna?'

1429
01:42:01,145 --> 01:42:03,306
'Anyone can fall in love
with you, Mrs. Khanna. '

1430
01:42:05,350 --> 01:42:06,681
How sweet!

1431
01:42:08,219 --> 01:42:11,382
'Last night,
Mrs. Khanna's story came to an end. '

1432
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:13,890
It was not so difficult for Akash
to move on.

1433
01:42:14,125 --> 01:42:15,786
We are still good friends today.

1434
01:42:15,860 --> 01:42:17,885
Love is a beautiful thing.

1435
01:42:18,129 --> 01:42:19,562
But love doesn't come alone.

1436
01:42:19,631 --> 01:42:21,531
It brings complications
along with it.

1437
01:42:21,599 --> 01:42:22,725
Excuse me.

1438
01:42:26,137 --> 01:42:27,536
When Akash did not know that. .

1439
01:42:27,605 --> 01:42:29,664
. .complication is just
around the corner.

1440
01:42:29,907 --> 01:42:33,343
Or may I say,
love just around the corner.

1441
01:42:33,611 --> 01:42:35,545
Actually,
my flight has been delayed.

1442
01:42:35,913 --> 01:42:37,437
Can I get something to drink?

1443
01:42:37,515 --> 01:42:39,176
But, that's only
if you guys are still working.

1444
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:40,444
Yes, yes sure.

1445
01:42:40,518 --> 01:42:42,315
We're open 24 hours.

1446
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:43,714
Please, have a seat.

1447
01:42:49,894 --> 01:42:52,260
Go. Ask her what she wants.

1448
01:42:54,699 --> 01:42:55,757
Go.

1449
01:42:55,867 --> 01:42:58,836
Come on, come on go.

1450
01:43:01,472 --> 01:43:04,805
What can I get for you, Ms. .
- Mrs. Khan.

1451
01:43:11,916 --> 01:43:17,377
I wanted to be Mrs. Khan,
but I was deceived.

1452
01:43:18,723 --> 01:43:21,783
Strange, something
similar happened with me.

1453
01:43:22,193 --> 01:43:24,457
Really? What is your name?

1454
01:43:24,629 --> 01:43:26,290
Akash.
- Khan.

1455
01:43:26,731 --> 01:43:28,892
What? Quiet.

1456
01:43:30,802 --> 01:43:35,364
Akash Khanna,
still waiting for Mrs. Khanna.

1457
01:43:37,375 --> 01:43:41,277
You're really fast.
I don't think I want anything.

1458
01:43:50,455 --> 01:43:51,979
Come on. Go.

1459
01:43:53,991 --> 01:44:01,591
''They seem so nice. ''

1460
01:44:02,767 --> 01:44:12,733
''This earth, the rivers, the night. .
- And?''

1461
01:44:12,810 --> 01:44:15,278
''And you. ''

1462
01:44:16,180 --> 01:44:20,583
''They seem so nice. ''

1463
01:44:20,785 --> 01:44:22,343
''This earth, the rivers,
the night. . ''

1464
01:44:22,420 --> 01:44:24,911
You told me,
that if you had been married. .

1465
01:44:25,356 --> 01:44:26,948
. .you would've been Mrs. Khan.

1466
01:44:27,191 --> 01:44:30,649
But you didn't tell me your name.
- Raina.

1467
01:44:31,662 --> 01:44:32,890
Raina.

1468
01:44:40,171 --> 01:44:41,570
What's so funny?

1469
01:44:41,873 --> 01:44:45,707
Nothing. But don't say that,
the one you were going to marry. .

1470
01:44:45,777 --> 01:44:49,543
. . his name is Samir.
- Of course.

1471
01:44:51,482 --> 01:44:55,384
''Who. . is that lovely lady?''

1472
01:44:55,686 --> 01:45:00,350
''Walking down the street. .
she's driving me crazy. ''

1473
01:45:00,925 --> 01:45:04,884
''Who. . is that lovely lady?''

1474
01:45:05,129 --> 01:45:07,222
''The way she's swinging
her hips and thighs. ''

1475
01:45:07,298 --> 01:45:08,765
''She got me mesmerised. ''

1476
01:45:09,167 --> 01:45:11,465
''She's driving me crazy. ''

1477
01:45:11,536 --> 01:45:16,235
''Ooh Mrs. Khanna. Ooh Mrs. Khanna. ''

1478
01:45:16,474 --> 01:45:18,806

''Give me a chance to become yours.

''Please smile, come closer. ''

''If you're leaving,
