1
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,950
Hello, Your Honor. - Hello.

2
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,540
High Court judge, Chaitanya Raj..

3
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,850
..was murdered in broad daylight.

4
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,690
This violent incident took place..

5
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,980
..outside the Vigneshwar temple,
in Nanapuram..

6
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,580
..amongst many people.

7
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,420
The individual that
shot this coverage..

8
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,560
..wants to keep
his identity a secret.

9
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,760
Why is that, sir?

10
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,060
Madam. When the
High Court judge is..

11
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,100
..murdered in daylight,
who's going to save me?

12
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,070
l'm here to create
awareness in people.

13
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,270
l've uploaded the video on YouTube.

14
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,710
Nagapuram's become a
base for illegal wine shops.

15
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,680
lllegal arms trade is flourishing.

16
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,440
lt also houses red-light
areas and drugs without a permit.

17
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,440
And now, daylight murder as well.

18
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,380
This is politics.

19
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,320
They hire goons from outside
forjust 10,000-15,000..

20
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,790
..and commit a murder everyday.

21
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,490
How can we recognize them?

22
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,420
They could be amongst us as well.

23
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,730
one beer.

24
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:17,730
TEAM DDH~RG

25
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,700
Beauty lies in the
eyes of the beer holder.

26
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:25,140
l can tell.. you aren't
sober yet from last night.

27
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,000
And, you're drinking again.

28
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,100
What the...

29
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,940
You sell duplicate liquor,
but did l complain?

30
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,250
You keep this wine shop open
all night, but did l complain?

31
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,290
Who are you?

32
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,550
Are you new here?

33
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,290
What's your name?

34
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,960
A man's known for his deeds,
not his name. - Super.

35
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,770
Two rice cakes.

36
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,830
Move!

37
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,380
Waiter. Just cakes.

38
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,040
Get him some lentil
and chutney. - Yes.

39
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,180
No need.

40
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,220
How are you going to eat that?

41
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,490
l had seen rice-lentil.

42
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,130
But for the first time,
l'm seeing rice-beer.

43
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,890
Water.

44
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,700
Liquor again.

45
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,340
Move!

46
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,710
Are the people in this
city hard of hearing?

47
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,350
Why play so loud?

48
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,480
These goons are good
for nothing, Toto.

49
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,740
Move!

50
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,660
That's how it feels
when someone honks.

51
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,760
Bro, l honked because
you didn't give us way.

52
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,300
You want a way. - Yes.

53
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,380
Toto.

54
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:18,380
Bro! Bro!

55
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,290
This is where you belong,
on the footpath. - Yes.

56
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,660
Now drive.

57
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,330
Excuse me. Move.

58
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,140
Move aside.

59
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,270
Actually,
your area's swarming with ruffians.

60
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,240
lt took me a while
to deal with them.

61
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,310
Well, your daughter
Seher's taking really long.

62
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,880
Govind. ls Seher ready?
- She's ready.

63
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,350
Then call her.

64
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,350
Actually, l don't know whether..

65
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,120
..she'll come this way, or that...

66
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,250
Look...

67
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,830
Sir, your chair.. - Seher.

68
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,820
Sir, your chair.. - Seher.

69
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,630
What an introduction?

70
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,710
Seher. What are you doing outside?

71
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,980
When l found out you're coming..

72
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,810
..l was on cloud no.9.  Really?

73
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,520
Wow! What a smile.

74
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,730
You're smiling and looking at me.

75
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,130
No, l am not.

76
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,740
You're making me laugh. - Whatever.

77
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,830
Since l saw your picture,
you're in my heart and mind.

78
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,540
Just keep me in your heart,
not in your mind. - Why?

79
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,410
Because, it's not nice to
stay in empty spaces. - Whatever.

80
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,410
Lower the sari!

81
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,280
Lower the sari? - Bye.

82
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,410
Bye.

83
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,350
Hey. old man.

84
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,950
Hurry up.

85
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,360
Hey, you. oldie.

86
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,620
Bye.

87
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,160
Aunty. Aunty.

88
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,830
That old man eloped
with your daughter.

89
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,760
That old man's my husband.

90
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,240
Husband?

91
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,740
Actually,
l'm a Hindu and he's a Muslim.

92
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,500
l want Seher to marry a Hindu..

93
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,440
..and he wants her
to marry a Muslim.

94
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,520
So whenever a Muslim
boy comes to see her..

95
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,480
..l help Seher run away.

96
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,390
And whenever a Hindu
boy comes to see her..

97
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,230
..he helps Seher to run.. away.

98
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,400
Your personal differences shattered
my friend's heart. - Sorry.

99
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,630
That's okay,
because l'm in love with her.

100
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,270
When she looked at me..

101
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,410
..it felt like someone
pierced my heart, Toto.

102
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,480
Forget it.
Let's go see another girl.

103
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,810
We already met 1200 girls,
they all rejected me.

104
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,420
Help me out before l
become a senior citizen, Toto.

105
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,610
Fine.

106
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,580
From now, this is Toto's motto.

107
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,990
l mean eloping like thieves.

108
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,290
Your mother and l have trust
and understanding between us.

109
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,730
What? - l mean, l never trust her..

110
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,200
..and she never understands me.

111
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,300
Excuse me.

112
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,900
l think this is your bike's key!
- Thank you.

113
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,500
l've been looking for it.
- lt's okay.

114
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,910
Papa. - Yes.

115
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,920
Papa, was it much of
a trouble in helping me elope?

116
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,760
Not at all.

117
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,520
l'm with you. l'll do as you say.

118
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,820
Thank you.  Don't mention it.

119
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,860
l'll always speak for you.

120
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,530
He's leaving on a black bike.

121
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,070
But he was trying
to start that red bike.

122
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,770
oh, no, Vinay.
You lost your bike's key.

123
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,230
And there goes your bike.

124
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,430
Thief! Thief! Thief!

125
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,370
My bike!

126
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,750
Good morning.

127
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,220
Do you just stand there
holding that? - Yes.

128
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,160
Does it have any bullets?

129
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,420
lt's inside.

130
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,360
You mean in this.

131
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,590
No. l mean inside,
with the inspector.

132
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,930
That means, you just
stand out here with the gun.

133
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,430
otherwise, at this age l
won't be able to stand too long.

134
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,230
Yeah, right.

135
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,910
Hold it. Hold it tight.

136
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,320
Hello, sir.

137
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,390
Sir, l stole a bike.
- Lodge a written complaint.

138
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,220
We'll call you if we find it.
Now go.

139
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,990
ls everyone hard of hearing here?

140
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,620
l stole the bike. - What?

141
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,560
You stole the bike? - Yes.

142
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,030
l used give a commission
at the last place.

143
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,700
lt must apply here too.

144
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,140
How much for a bike?

145
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,300
You think we follow
the system here?

146
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,410
You'll hand us a commission,
and we'll take it.

147
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,600
Come closer.

148
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,110
There's a shop on the right,
just outside.

149
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,270
He has a list.

150
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,850
For cars, bikes. Cycles too.

151
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,450
Total fixed price.

152
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,290
The bad news is that
the shop's closed. - Sir.

153
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,880
And the good news is..

154
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,180
..you can get a printout
from this computer.

155
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,660
Concentrate on the job.

156
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,630
Give him a printout of our rate.

157
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,870
Gold. Silver. House-theft.

158
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,930
Let's see under transport,
it's a bike. - lt's all here.

159
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,470
2010. Rs.4000. - Yeah. lt's fixed.

160
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,910
Sir, this looks like
a fancy menu card.

161
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,710
lt's all fixed.

162
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,210
one, two, three, four..
- only four.

163
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,010
Four? - Yes.

164
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,450
We've a fixed rate.

165
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,780
Just keep that here. - Here?

166
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,980
Yes, here.

167
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,520
l'm an honest corrupt man.
- l see that.

168
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,470
Do come again. - Right.

169
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,690
You look new.

170
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,860
You're not from my area.

171
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,940
Do come again. - Yes.

172
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,860
Sir.. - What?

173
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,770
ls there a commission
for pick-pocketing as well?

174
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,000
of course.

175
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,640
But it depends on
how loaded the wallet is.

176
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,650
How much? - 2400.

177
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:30,450
M-2400 into...

178
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,180
Rs.600. Come on.

179
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,550
600.

180
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,420
Where? - Right there.

181
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:39,730

00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,100
Do come again. - okay, sir.

183
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,970
okay.

184
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,800
Listen. Don't worry.

185
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,600
We even have festival offer.

186
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,540
We give 10'/' discount
on 31st and 'Diwali'.

187
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,070
okay, sir. l'll remember.

188
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,180
Sir, Rs.50 for the tea.

189
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,810
My wallet?

190
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,750
What happened, sir?

191
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,790
Where's my wallet? - Wallet?

192
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,990
What color, sir? - Brown color.

193
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,580
Brown color? - Where is it?

194
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,050
How much money did it contain, sir?

195
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,720
Yesterday's entire collection.

196
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,390
2400, sir.

197
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,820
Amazing.

198
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,360
He picked a police
officer's pocket.

199
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He's bad news for Nagapuram.

200
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,240
His antics are going to make us...

201
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,070
Come, sir.

202
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,240
Come, sir.

203
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,250
This way.

204
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,390
Sir, he's here.

205
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,100
He's the one. - Come in, sir.

206
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,530
This is.. country bomb.

207
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,670
Main bomb.. big blast!

208
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,430
This is time-bomb.

209
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,700
Fix time.. big blast!

210
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,000
And...

211
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,100
Here.

212
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,840
This is a cell phone bomb.

213
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,010
After putting-in timing,
immediate blast!

214
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,980
Sir. This is an eggplant bomb.

215
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,450
Very, very dangerous.

216
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,450
This is a lunch-box bomb.

217
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,060
For school.

218
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,990
Millions of children die.

219
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,390
This is why we make this bomb.

220
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,630
Sir.. see, all the guns are here.

221
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:25,170
Double-barrel gun.
Pump gun. 9mm gun. All here, sir.

222
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,570
lt's all here.

223
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,900
Choose, sir.

224
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,880
Good selection, sir.

225
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,280
You need a ball along
with the bat to hit a six.

226
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:37,750
Bullets? Magazine?

227
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,010
Give him the magazine.

228
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,530
How much?

229
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,790
Loaded gun, 80,000.

230
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,330
People in this city
are hard of hearing.

231
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,530
How much do you have? - Sir. Sir.

232
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,600
This much only, sir.

233
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,340
Veeramani's given the green signal.
So, go meet him.

234
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,230
Do you know how powerful he is?
He's a feared don.

235
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,880
He's got a lot of men.

236
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,360
Your name precedes you.

237
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,370
But no one knows your name yet.

238
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,130
A man's known for his deeds,
not his name.

239
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,770
Your target is Raju Lamba.

240
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,310
lf l kill him,
it'll create problems.

241
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,650
l'm the main killer
for the opposition party.

242
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,510
And the ruling party is
trying to be the third umpire.

243
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,120
So, we need someone new.

244
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,920
Money? - 500,000.

245
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,180
What?

246
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:55,920
No.

247
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,370
Brother. Take it.
l don't want a commission either.

248
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,200
He's a powerful man.
- Fine, 1 million.

249
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,470
This is inspector K.V. Reddy.

250
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,270
He'll make arrangements
in the area..

251
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,070
..where you'll kill Lamba.

252
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:16,840
But you'll kill your
target from a distance.

253
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:17,980
How's your aim?

254
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,120
Palli, hand me your gun. - No need.

255
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,280
Before every good deed..

256
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,260
..you should break a coconut.

257
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,540
You wanted to see my aim, right?

258
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,870
So.. what should l aim at?

259
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,340
That bulb.

260
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,690
Stop joking.
- l neverjoke, only shoot.

261
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,040
Stop it

262
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,170
How dare you assault
a police officer!

263
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,770
officer, arrest him.

264
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,210
For assault and battering..

265
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,780
..and for the murder
of the opposition's main man.

266
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,180
Who are you talking about?

267
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,680
He's a murderer himself.

268
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,690
That's the same
Veeramani who murdered..

269
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,120
..a High Court judge
outside the Ganesh temple.

270
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,330
But who are you to uphold the law?

271
00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:02,030
l am a man known for his deeds,
not his name.

272
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,260
l am Deputy Commissioner of Police.

273
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,480
Rudra Aditya Devraj.

274
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,750
Transferred to Nagapuram.

275
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,720
Listen carefully.

276
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,290
l'm here to mop the streets!

277
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:30,490
To rid this place of goons!

278
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,620
Arrest that officer..

279
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,070
..under section 120B
of criminal conspiracy.

280
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,470
And arrest the goons
under Goonda Act.

281
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,560
Arrest them!

282
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,610
Long live.. - Mr. Nagori!

283
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,050
Long live.. - Mr. Nagori!

284
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,740
Long live.. - Mr. Nagori!

285
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,350
Long live.. - Mr. Nagori!

286
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,920
Nagori sir.

287
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,960
Long live.. - Mr. Nagori!

288
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,660
Long live.. - Mr. Nagori!

289
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,730
As long as the sun
and the moon exist..

290
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,790
..Nagori will be remembered.

291
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,430
Louder!

292
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,240
Welcome, sir.

293
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,500
Nagori sir...

294
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,240
No need to stoop that low.

295
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:23,350
That's outdated.

296
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,440
Something new.

297
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,880
As long as Twitter
and Facebook exist..

298
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,510
..Nagori Subramanium
will be in power.

299
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,150
Sir, we just want you
to bless us with your grace.

300
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,590
And we'll be happy, always.

301
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,680
You see.

302
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,190
l may not have a voice
like Mohammad Rafi..

303
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,490
..but my power's like Muhammad Ali.

304
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:44,290
Very good.
- That's why l am the PM. - PM?

305
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,600
'Politician Maker!'

306
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,900
So, shall we? - Not now, sir.

307
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:57,140
Right now.. - No, no.
l just want to test my voice.

308
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,350
Sir, time for lunch!

309
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,250
'Give me some alms!'

310
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,290
'Give me some alms!'

311
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,700
'l've no change.  Cheapskate.'

312
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,830
Enjoy your food, sir.

313
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,330
Enjoy your food, sir.

314
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,970
'Get back in line.'

315
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,100
'Taking a shortcut. - l'm hungry.'

316
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,040
'l'll deal with you outside.'

317
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,510
'Go back.'

318
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,280
'Go back. Go back. Go back.'

319
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,040
What happened, sir? - Later...

320
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,050
Sir.. sir...

321
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,790
l like to sit down and eat.
- Sir.. - ls the car ready?

322
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,960
Nagori sir, there's good news.

323
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,890
What?

324
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,990
Veeramani, the opposition's
main henchman. - Yeah.

325
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,930
The police killed him yesterday.

326
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:56,010
Who is the new officer
transferred here?

327
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,970
DCP Rudra Aditya Devraj.

328
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,870
'oh, God! He's the new DCP.'

329
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,160
'You're dead.'

330
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,770
Who hoisted the flag?

331
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,140
Sir. - The flag's three
inches below the mark.

332
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,690
l couldn't see the difference
from this distance.

333
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,910
lf your wife elopes with
your neighbor at a distance..

334
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,190
..then you won't see that either.

335
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:51,800
Those who are short-sighted,
lack power.

336
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,530
lnspector Naik. - Yes, sir.

337
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,260
You're suspended for a week.

338
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,310
At ease.

339
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:06,010
Listen carefully.

340
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:09,110
l don't care if you don't
wear your uniform on duty.

341
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,050
You can wear your cap backwards.

342
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,980
But if anyone hesitates
in doing his duty..

343
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,480
..then l'll lose my cool.

344
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,760
And l won't transfer
or dismiss that officer.

345
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,260
l'll simply gut him..

346
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,530
..and dump him in the sewer
behind the police station.

347
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,060
Do you understand? - Yes, sir!

348
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,030
There's more to
me than meets the eye.

349
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,400
l've been transferred
here from many districts.

350
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:33,600
DCP Rudra.

351
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:36,470
Born in Mumbai,
brought up in lndia.

352
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,380
Close your mouth and your zip.

353
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,010
You may let the criminals go free.

354
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,950
But no innocent should be harmed.

355
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,420
Reassure the people
that we're their brothers..

356
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:55,360
..and the goons,
that we're their worst nightmare.

357
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,830
All of you police
officers together..

358
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,900
..couldn't curb the increasing
crime rate in Nagapuram.

359
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,040
Shame on you people!

360
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,300
lnspector Javed. - Yes, sir.

361
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,330
Sir.

362
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,640
l've heard that the department
here has a rate-card.

363
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,180
Sorry, it was a mistake.

364
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,050
But today the management changes.

365
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:26,280
This is a list of
those who run a brothel.

366
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,090
okay, sir.

367
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,660
Names of bike thieves.

368
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,390
Weapons and arms-dealers.

369
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:35,090
Unlicensed wine-shops and
trucks without permit. - okay, sir.

370
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,560
Make their records and files.
- okay, sir.

371
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:43,470
Sir, it seems like Gabbar
has joined the police force.

372
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,680
Can't help it, the place
is filled with helpless 'Thakurs'.

373
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,680
They need the spark to be invoked.

374
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,740
Sir.

375
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,410
From today,
no more vandalism in this city.

376
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,020
only Policegiri.

377
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,780
Sir, can l ask you a question?

378
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,290
Don't feel offended.  No.

379
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,860
Are you a goon or police? - Combo.

380
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,260
Buy 1 get 1 free.

381
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,720
Mind it!

382
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:23,340
You've changed? - Not just me,
the entire department did.

383
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,710
How? - New boss.

384
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,490
Time to meet him.

385
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,930
Where's he?

386
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,240
Sir, the diamond
necklace has been stolen?

387
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,440
l didn't do it.

388
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,640
How's that possible?

389
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,210
Guards. Shutter down.

390
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,110
Call the police. - Sir.

391
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,870
The police won't respond so soon.

392
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:12,310
With the new DCP in town,
the police respond instantly.

393
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,420
Subhash. - Yes, sir.

394
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,210
Vishal. - Yes, sir.

395
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,350
Search everyone.

396
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,220
Look, mister.. - Right. Look here.

397
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,760
No need to look anywhere else.

398
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:19,920
Here's your thief.

399
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,220
l've seen him stealing
before.

400
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,490
100'/'. He's the thief.

401
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,000
He was asking about the CCTV.

402
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,060
Ask them to check the CCTV.

403
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,160
Sir. - Yes.

404
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,260
My diamond necklace...

405
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,460
Sir.

406
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,670
Sir? - Yes.
The new DCP Rudra Aditya Devraj.

407
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,330
DCP sir.

408
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,600
Sorry, sir.

409
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,830
But my necklace?

410
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,030
Where is it?

411
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,440
lt's in this bag.

412
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:42,170
This bag? - What? My bag?

413
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,040
Here's the necklace.

414
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,380
Yes, sir. That's the one.

415
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,680
l didn't steal it.
l am not a thief.

416
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,220
He's the thief. - Him?

417
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,450
l didn't steal it. - You didn't.

418
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,580
No.

419
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,150
Sir, it was me.

420
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,050
Take him away.

421
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,370
His jacket is loose,
just like his character.

422
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,330
Look. The thread
was stuck on your bag.

423
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,310
Thank you, sir.

424
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,740
Sorry. Sorry for the inconvenience.

425
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:12,830
Sorry.

426
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,780
Sir, l'm really very sorry.

427
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,540
lsn't that Seher
who had winked at me?

428
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,350
l'll be right back.

429
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,620
And that's the same
goon who almost killed you.

430
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,450
You're mistaken.

431
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:27,660
l didn't mean...

432
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,700
Next time,
think before you judge anyone.

433
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,860
l'm really sorry. Listen to me.

434
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,090
Just a minute.

435
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,200
l said sorry.

436
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,500
But why did you steal that bike?

437
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,300
l'll tell you later.

438
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,770
A nice girl like her with a goon.

439
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,350
What's wrong with girls'
preferences these days?

440
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,080
Girls these days
have weird preferences.

441
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,220
Seher likes a goon.

442
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,190
But l never killed
a mosquito. - Why?

443
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,680
Because l use an insect repellent.

444
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,730
Forget that, and listen to me.

445
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:10,160
lf you want to be her groom,
you'll have to be a goon.

446
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,130
That's the only way
you can win that girl.

447
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,700
Wow!

448
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,550
Wow!

449
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,780
Sir. Sir. DCP Rudra.

450
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,650
Why is he so scared?

451
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:44,130
l've been waiting for this day...

452
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,500
Let him go.

453
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,560
Hello, DCP sir.

454
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,140
Come in.

455
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,340
Name, Rudra Aditya Devraj.

456
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,080
Pet name, Baba.

457
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,540
Posting, Sadanandpur.

458
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,550
You have a cold bank balance,
and a hot temper.

459
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:02,120
You're still single, but
you've taken the nuptial rounds...

460
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,190
l mean, you've been
transferred seven times.

461
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:09,820
Kolva, Vailu, Shirvada,
Virur, Sidhpur, Chandrapur.

462
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,060
Favorite holiday spot.
Police station.

463
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,290
Favorite game, bashing criminals.

464
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:20,070
You're allergic to chocolates.
Migraine problem.

465
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,440
What's wrong?

466
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,100
Struck a chord!

467
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,770
How do l know so much about you?

468
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,040
of course.

469
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,880
l know everything about
anyone who comes close to me.

470
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,150
But no one knows about me. - l do.

471
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,020
Nagori Nityanand Subramanium.

472
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,360
Pet name, Nunu.

473
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,380
Twice married.

474
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,860
And got both your
sisters-in-law pregnant.

475
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,130
Your main business is liquor.

476
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,570
112 wine-shops.

477
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:55,500
99 belong to you.
And 13 without permit.

478
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,230
70 trucks pass by the Narmada.

479
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,940
38 belong to you.

480
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,480
And 32 without permit.

481
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,520
l can't remember the figures.

482
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:10,590
But you have hot chicks in all
your eight lodges as sex-workers.

483
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,120
And if we talk about power..

484
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,020
..you select and reject
the MLAs and MPs..

485
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,320
..from all the eight districts.

486
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,360
And in the beginning..

487
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:23,800
..you used to beg
near Novelty Cinema.

488
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,670
Beggar.

489
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,200
You're a beggar.

490
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:29,540
And you also suffered
from piles back then.

491
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,110
You still do, don't you?

492
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,970
He knows everything.

493
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,450
Since you've arrived in Nagapuram,
people are happy.

494
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:42,890
lt's time for you to exit now.
Transfer.

495
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,110
This discussion is pointless.

496
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:48,230
lf you don't take bribe, l will...

497
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,820
Who said DCP Rudra
won't take bribe?

498
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,210
What did you say?

499
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:07,280
He's honest. He won't accept it?
- That's what l heard...

500
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,510
Give him a chair!

501
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,980
Hey. DCP.

502
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,450
After being transferred seven
times, l've learned one thing.

503
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,750
Money's better than hot-temper.

504
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,990
Great.

505
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,100
How much? - You say.

506
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,160
Padam.

507
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:35,440
TEAM DDH~RG

508
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,640
Before l take the money,
l have three conditions.

509
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,030
What?

510
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:43,880
So, you're going to have a ball,
at my expense. - No.

511
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,320
You do the wrong
thing the wrong way.

512
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:50,410
l just want to do the
right thing the wrong way.

513
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,360
No.1, your workers want
to host a political rally.

514
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,520
Go ahead.

515
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,400
But if they harass the people,
l'll lock them up.

516
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,760
And no one will bail them out.

517
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:06,470
No.2, l've no interest
in your illegal business.

518
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,940
But your goons extort
money from the people.

519
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:16,080
lf they don't stop,
l'll bash them without a warning.

520
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:21,820
No.3, you own illegal wine-shops.

521
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,390
Go ahead.

522
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,050
But seven of your wine-shops..

523
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,690
..are next to temples and schools.

524
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,590
l'm not asking you to shut them.

525
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,220
Just shift them some place else.

526
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:35,730
lf you accept these
conditions, then...

527
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:42,560
Nagori sir...

528
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:50,280
l think we two will get along.

529
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:06,750
What's going on, Nagori sir?

530
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:07,990
You quietly heard
all his conditions.

531
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,400
Right, Nagori sir.

532
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,370
He took the bribe
and kept conditions...

533
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,700
Forget the conditions.

534
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:16,100
A pet lion is better
than a wild dog.

535
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,340
He's honest, but he's corrupt.

536
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:22,400
And l'm also attached
with him emotionally. -How?

537
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,250
My dead brother,
his name was Rudramani Subramanium.

538
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,380
He touched a chord in my heart.

539
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,880
l like him.

540
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,560
He could've definitely
been an actor.

541
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,460
Film star. l mean it.

542
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,120
What style. What style.

543
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,830
Before you can be a goon,
you'll need henchmen.

544
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,600
Henchmen? - Bodyguard.

545
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,570
First, you'll have
to change your getup.

546
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,750
Wow! What a getup.

547
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,520
Like 'Super-goon'. - Really?

548
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,920
But.. there's one thing missing.

549
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:02,780
What?

550
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,250
Toto.

551
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,890
l want to be the groom,
not the bride.

552
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,260
That's the rowdy fashion
these days. - l see.

553
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,030
You mean times have changed. - Yes.

554
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,560
But there's still
one thing missing.

555
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,290
That's deadly.

556
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,900
l've fitted your
soles with steel plates.

557
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:24,370
Drag your feet on the ground.

558
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,230
Set the place on fire.

559
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:38,620
Wow! You look 90'/' like a goon.

560
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:42,530
only 10'/' left.. Fire! Fire! Fire!

561
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,830
Throw water.
The fire is growing.

562
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,530
My feet!

563
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,160
My foot's broken.

564
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,000
My feet!

565
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,470
Sir, l admit my son
caused the accident.

566
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:57,140
The victim died due
to my son's carelessness.

567
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,500
But you can save my son.

568
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,650
The deceased's family
has lodged a complaint.

569
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,580
And this is not a case
of drunk and driving.

570
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,780
lt's murder.

571
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,220
But you can...

572
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,410
Yes, sir.

573
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,900
1.5 million.
l'll shut down the case.

574
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,660
You really outdid it this time.

575
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,070
Papa was stunned.

576
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,170
l had to.

577
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:31,740
Did you see the boy
he invited home this time?

578
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,070
Mr. Shabbir Khan.

579
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,880
And after marrying him..

580
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:38,310
..l could've told my
friends My name is Khan.

581
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,360
Rascal...

582
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:36,570
Thankfully he didn't cut your legs.

583
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,340
Sir, the bad news is..

584
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,420
..it was Veeramani's
henchman here to kill you.

585
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:48,750
And the good news is, he'll
be rotting in jail for a long time.

586
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,420
The good news is our
Gabbar Singh is safe.

587
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:55,650
And the bad news is..

588
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:59,490
..our Gabbar Singh has fallen
for that Basanti on the scooter.

589
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,700
Sorry. Sorry, sir.

590
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,530
Her phone's broken.

591
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,030
No. Black.

592
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,470
l'm no hero, l'm a villain.

593
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,730
Nice song.

594
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:15,140
That's not the speaker.
lt's coming from the bag.

595
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:16,740
The bag.

596
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:23,450
l'm no hero, l'm a villain.

597
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,050
Wow!

598
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,720
Strange. Someone's already
gifted you the same thing.

599
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,990
DCP Rudra Aditya Devraj here.

600
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,260
You lost your phone because of me.

601
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,700
So, a small gift for you.

602
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,530
And you also saved my life.

603
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,070
Thank you. - Always mention.

604
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:45,340
What? - Always mention.

605
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:48,310
But how did the new
phone get in my purse?

606
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,840
Seher. Anything can
be placed in your purse.

607
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:54,350
That's right.

608
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,220
But DCP Rudra Aditya Devraj..

609
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,880
..follows the footsteps of thieves.

610
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,050
Can't help it.

611
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,250
l spend time amongst criminals.

612
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:02,990
lt's bound to have
an influence on me.

613
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,360
l've been asking you so many times.

614
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,900
At least tell me
why you stole that bike.

615
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,420
Some other day.

616
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,500
Today l'm in the
mood for something else.

617
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,300
Anyway, thanks. - Always mention.

618
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,170
What?

619
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,640
Always mention.

620
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:31,650
Love's filled with stir.

621
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,420
lt's so cruel...

622
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:43,090
The paths of love.

623
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:00,450
l can't stay away from you.

624
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:04,220
Just like a pearl in the ocean.

625
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,250
l see God in your eyes.

626
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:13,630
You're my pilgrim.

627
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,760
You're my God.

628
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:37,550
Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali!

629
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,250
Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali!

630
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:44,930
Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali!

631
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,730
Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali!

632
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,540
You're my beginning and end.

633
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,170
l can't live without you.

634
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:10,910
God's my witness.

635
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:14,660
l feel restless every moment.

636
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:18,730
l can't stay away.

637
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:24,090
l can't stay away from you.

638
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,840
Just like a pearl in the ocean.

639
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:31,800
l see God in your eyes.

640
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:37,110
You're my pilgrim.

641
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,220
You're my God.

642
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:53,900
You're my pilgrim.

643
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:59,500
You're my God.

644
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:01,140
Mr. Nagori.

645
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:03,970
My conscience stops me
from doing the wrong thing.

646
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,440
Tell your conscience that..

647
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:09,310
..too many refusals
can lead you to your end.

648
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,450
Such negativity is not nice.

649
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:12,950
Everyone's corrupt these days.

650
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,490
You can't control
three things in lndia.

651
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,590
Population,
pollution, and corruption.

652
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:20,880
Come on.

653
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:22,430
Approve my MLA's tender.

654
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,390
Please, Mr. Nagori.

655
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,400
You invited me here, honored me.

656
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:26,900
Don't try to push me.

657
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:27,960
Please stop this game.

658
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:30,900
Game.

659
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:32,160
The game's about to begin.

660
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:35,330
Dice!

661
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:38,570
You see,
our meeting's become too dicey.

662
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,310
So, this dice will
decide your fate.

663
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:45,350
one, two, three, four, five, six.

664
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,010
Six lives.

665
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,820
one to five, you die. - Nagori.

666
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:53,120
Let's play.

667
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:56,420
What is it?

668
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,200
Six. l am saved.

669
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,760
l am saved.

670
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:02,530
Mr. Nagori,
you said if it's six, l'll live.

671
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,300
lt's six.

672
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:08,530
But there's another
rule in dice. - What?

673
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:11,610
lf it's six, then repeat.

674
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:16,940
Nagori. Nagori. Nagori.

675
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,380
Four!

676
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,850
Nagori. Nagori...

677
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,580
Get Rajesh Kamat
transferred in his place.

678
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:28,660
He's more corrupt
than you can imagine.

679
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:30,890
Sir. DCP Rudra's here. - Rudra!

680
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,100
Get him out of here.

681
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:36,260
Burn him to ashes in our coal mine.

682
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,000
Leave no trace.

683
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:40,660
Location change!

684
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,270
Greetings, sir.

685
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:49,310
Welcome.

686
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,210
So? Everything okay? - No.

687
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:57,360
Prithvi, the henchman
of Dallari area's MLA..

688
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,580
..is extorting money from people.

689
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:04,120
Come here.

690
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,630
Tell Prithvi, if he wants to live,
he has to stop all this. - Right.

691
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:11,730
okay.

692
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,070
Let's talk.

693
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:15,570
Padam.

694
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,540
Lift that...

695
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:23,510
Did you observe one thing?

696
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:25,810
The letter P in life
is very important.

697
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:28,280
Like for you, P for Police.

698
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,390
P for Public.

699
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:30,580
Same for me.

700
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:33,020
P for Power. P for Politics.

701
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:35,520
And there's one thing
common for both of us.

702
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,790
'Paisa' (Money)!

703
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:39,160
That's how it is.

704
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,290
Hello. Yes, Seher.

705
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,400
Why are you screaming?

706
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,430
l'll be there in a while. okay.

707
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:48,330
Who was on the phone?

708
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:49,640
Secret admirer.

709
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:52,370
This won't do.

710
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:56,350
Here's a bigger one.

711
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,870
You have a family.
You'll need this.

712
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:05,050
Before you leave, just once...

713
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:07,220
That will cost extra.

714
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:21,600
See. Just like my younger brother.

715
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:25,840
At times for pocket money,
he would...

716
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,180
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

717
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:35,590
Thank God you're here.
Look what's going on there.

718
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,190
Shocked, aren't you?

719
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:43,260
Being a government servant,
he's openly taking bribe.

720
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:45,590
Don't just watch. Arrest him.

721
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,220
Hey, biker.

722
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,630
Yes, sir.  What, sir?

723
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,010
He's going to chew you out now.

724
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:56,700
You're suspended for a week.

725
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:18,790
According to me,
taking bribe is worse than murder.

726
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,060
People are scared
of cancer and swine-flu.

727
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,330
But this is the biggest disease.

728
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,270
Corruption.
They should be scared of it.

729
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,660
l'm scared.

730
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:28,870
What? - Nothing. Nothing.

731
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:35,170
Corrupt people should
be stoned publicly.

732
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:37,380
lt shows.  What?

733
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:39,370
Your temper.  of course.

734
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,380
What about you?
Doesn't your blood boil?

735
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:42,820
l'm scared to death.

736
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,010
What?

737
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:46,180
Nothing. l'm losing my temper.

738
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,250
of course. lt's the limit.

739
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:49,660
There's a limit to everything.

740
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:51,260
But why are you sweating?

741
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:54,030
Because l'm terrified. - What?

742
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,100
l mean the AC's not working.

743
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,860
So, l'm sweating.

744
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,130
Thank you.

745
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:11,580
Seher. My packet.  l'm sorry.

746
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,670
What's inside?

747
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,320
The original DVDs of 'Singham'!

748
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,480
What a great film.

749
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,390
You're bound to be carrying
such anti-corruption movies.

750
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:21,120
You won't have
bribe money in there.

751
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:22,850
Here.

752
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:25,300
Just a minute.

753
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,460
That day,
you stole the bike.. - Bye.

754
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:40,300
Rudra, l never said my
man didn't rape that girl.

755
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,310
He did.

756
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:46,720
But a girl that's 18 years old,
has a fair complexion..

757
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:49,150
..and a body to die for..

758
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,920
..who wouldn't lose control?

759
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,620
lf your daughter
had the same qualities..

760
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:55,650
..would you let him do her?
- Rudra!

761
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:59,120
Volume down!

762
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,070
Get up!

763
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,700
Take him away.

764
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:08,300
l won't make a case.

765
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,020
Gopi. Look.

766
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,310
There. - What?

767
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:22,920
Rudra let that rascal go.

768
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:32,530
Sir, that man raped my sister,
you let him go.

769
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,430
Sir, you let that swine go.

770
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:36,660
What could l do?

771
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:41,100
Arrest him?

772
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:43,500
Do you know what
would've happened then?

773
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,210
l would've been transferred.

774
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,510
But l don't care.

775
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:52,680
Any other officer would've
obeyed their command.

776
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:55,480
He would have lodged
a case against you.

777
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:59,350
He would've dragged
your sister to the court..

778
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:01,150
..and proved she's a prostitute.

779
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:03,520
He would've maligned you.

780
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,890
Won't we get justice? - You will.

781
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:08,800
You will get justice.

782
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,400
Have faith in me.

783
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:17,870
The law won't decide
his fate, l will.

784
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:34,110
What's this?

785
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:35,990
l don't want to catch
fire again, Toto.

786
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:37,080
Sir, look.

787
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,700
Time for your entry.

788
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:45,360
Go. Bash those goons
in front of Seher.

789
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:47,070
Come on, boys. Explode.

790
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,300
Hey!

791
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:55,310
Leave my red rose, you red bullies.

792
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:59,240
or else, your red blood
will flow in all the alleys.

793
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:01,880
Forgive us, sir.
- lt was a mistake.

794
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:03,150
We won't do it again.

795
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,480
We won't.

796
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:06,980
Look behind.

797
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:09,960
You're a great guy.

798
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:11,930
My getup and my gang..

799
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:13,690
..scared these people.

800
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:21,260
So, you were apologizing
to him. - Yes.

801
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,030
Let's go.

802
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,710
You want to humiliate
me in front of Seher.

803
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:29,780
Now, l'll humiliate you.
- He'll break you.

804
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:32,150
This love-triangle should end now.

805
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,950
one girl, two lovers.

806
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:35,950
one power-grenade,
two hand-grenades.

807
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:38,350
Whoever wins will be
Seher's prince charming.

808
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:41,690
Come on, hit me.

809
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,280
Hit me. Hit me.

810
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,700
Before every good deed,
you should break a coconut.

811
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,560
l know.

812
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:49,460
Break it with the hand, right?
l can do it too.

813
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,990
Coconut. Bring one here.

814
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:53,430
You'll break your hand.

815
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:54,760
Keep it here.

816
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,160
Sir.

817
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:14,390
Sir. Sir. Sir.

818
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,080
People are being
cheated of petrol..

819
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:17,680
..at the Govind Circle Petrol Pump.

820
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:18,790
What cheating?

821
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,200
They're giving very less petrol.

822
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:23,300
Which petrol station?
- The one at Govind Circle.

823
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:26,100
No point in telling me.

824
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:28,000
Approach the District Court.
-Sir...

825
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:30,130
But sir, a woman from
our colony questioned them..

826
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:31,510
..and they beat her up.

827
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,740
They really bashed her up.

828
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:36,640
Take her to the hospital.

829
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:39,520
Who beat her? - His name is Vijay.

830
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,920
How much? - one liter.

831
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:48,420
Cheapskate.

832
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,920
ln this. - We don't
give petrol in bottles.

833
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,540
lf you don't..

834
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:05,070
..then l'll fill you up
with petrol and light a match.

835
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:06,580
Get that? - Sir.

836
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,180
You're Vijay? - Yes, sir.

837
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:20,610
one liter.

838
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,990
This is one liter? - Yes.

839
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,230
This is Nagori
Subramanium's petrol pump.

840
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:30,530
You made a big
mistake by hitting me.

841
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:35,470
This is DCP Rudra
Aditya Devraj's area.

842
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:38,270
You made a bigger mistake
by hitting a woman.

843
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:40,840
You can't hit us because
you're a police officer.

844
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:43,280
Yes.

845
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:44,610
And what if we hit back?

846
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,170
DCP Rudra's beating us up.

847
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,460
Send your men.

848
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:35,350
Nagori sir. The Govind
Circle Petrol Pump's been sealed.

849
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,910
l guess this is your favorite song?

850
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:56,670
What language is it? - Tamil.

851
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,070
l spent some time in Tamil Nadu.

852
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,480
This is what l used to hear.

853
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:08,750
Will you have my
kids before marriage..

854
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:11,290
..or after we get married? - What?

855
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,320
l'm just explaining
the song to you.

856
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:15,690
Don't try to fool me.

857
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:18,000
You're trying to..
- You think l'm trying to..

858
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,430
..propose to you indirectly. - Yes.

859
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,090
And you're saying yes.

860
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,800
Stay here, l'll be right back.
No, Rudra.

861
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:06,700
Bless those who give,
and also who don't.

862
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:08,200
That's what the elders say.

863
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:09,770
But take me from me..

864
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:13,410
..and stab me in the back,
that's wrong.

865
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:14,640
That's my saying.

866
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:19,250
You sealed Nagori
Subramanium's petrol pump.

867
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,490
What did you think?
l won't mind?

868
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:22,990
Are you Rudra or Ghajini?

869
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,380
You forget.

870
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,920
You take bribe from me.

871
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:31,000
Weekly payment.

872
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,040
Look here! Look here!

873
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:39,070
Stray dogs don't attend school.

874
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:42,300
Still, they have
one in-born quality.

875
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:43,400
Loyalty.

876
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:47,710
And you try to betray me.

877
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:49,410
Who's that?

878
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:52,060
Your girlfriend. The one
on the phone that day. Right?

879
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:54,090
l sent some for you too.
Did you get it?

880
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:58,290
Better tell him to
be loyal to his masters.

881
01:00:58,530 --> 01:00:59,520
Hey!

882
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:01,690
one thing.

883
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,230
l might not have a
voice like Mohammad Rafi..

884
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,900
..but l have the
power of Muhammad Ali.

885
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:09,060
Next time you make this mistake..

886
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:11,870
..l'll fill you with bullet-holes.

887
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:16,410
Because l'm a beggar and a hunter.

888
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:18,420
Combo.

889
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,780
Buy 1 get 1 free.

890
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:37,990
Leave me.

891
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,230
Great, Nagori sir.

892
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:13,430
Take a pause.
So can l give you some good news?

893
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:17,270
What is it?
- Your petrol pump's been reopened.

894
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:18,400
Really? - Yes.

895
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:24,140
Don't get me wrong.

896
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:25,710
l'm just happy.

897
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:30,680
Petrol rates are touching the sky.

898
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:32,820
Rs.76 per liter.

899
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,980
But Nagori's power
has no boundaries.

900
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,760
So, l got the petrol pump..

901
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:39,620
..as well as Rudra
came to his senses.

902
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:40,750
What do you mean, Nagori?

903
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,630
Will you just let
off Rudra with a warning?

904
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:44,430
That's it?

905
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,530
l say let's play the
game of dice with him.

906
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,760
He's done my bidding.

907
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,970
Secondly,
he reminds me of my brother.

908
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:54,240
And he didn't say anything
before his girlfriend.

909
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:56,680
Don't judge the book by its cover.

910
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:58,610
He was calm before his hot lover.

911
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,250
Ups and downs are
common in relationships.

912
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:03,090
As long as corruption prevails..

913
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:05,250
..Nagori and Rudra
will stay friends.

914
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,420
Call him to our farmhouse.

915
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:11,030
We'll sing, dance.. reunion.

916
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:12,520
Music.

917
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:15,790
Roll 1 in orchestra.

918
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:31,880
Sway! Sway! Sway!

919
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:48,560
Sway! Sway! Sway!

920
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:52,330
Sway with the beat.

921
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:54,760
Sway with the beat.

922
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,100
Love's the divine
play of Krishna.

923
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,870
Sway with the beat!

924
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,040
Love's the divine

01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:03,040
Sway with the beat!

926
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:05,240

Sway with the beat!

928
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,340
Love's the divine
play of Krishna.

929
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:13,390
There's always restlessness.

930
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:17,650
The world shuns lovers.

931
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:21,660
There's always restlessness.

932
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:25,900
The world shuns lovers.

933
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:29,730
You just touched a raw nerve,
beloved.

934
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:34,310
You just touched a raw nerve,
beloved.

935
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,580
Sway with the beat!

936
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:39,050
Love's the divine
play of Krishna.

937
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:40,780
Sway with the beat!

938
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,910
Love's the divine
play of Krishna.

939
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:44,990
Sway with the beat!

940
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:47,350
Love's the divine
play of Krishna.

941
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:49,250
Sway with the beat!

942
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,350
Love's the divine
play of Krishna.

943
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:14,340
Love's a dangerous game.

944
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:18,380
lt's your worst nightmare.

945
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:20,480
Don't play the game of love.

946
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:22,650
lt's deep like the ocean.

947
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:26,790
Many have drowned in its depth.

948
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:30,830
There's always restlessness.

949
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:35,040
The world shuns lovers.

950
01:05:35,270 --> 01:05:39,270
You just touched a raw nerve,
beloved.

951
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,570
Sway with the beat!

952
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:43,810
Love's the divine
play of Krishna.

953
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,640
Sway with the beat!

954
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:47,750
Love's the divine
play of Krishna.

955
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,850
Sway with the beat!

956
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:52,320
Love's the divine
play of Krishna.

957
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:54,050
Sway with the beat!

958
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:56,250
Love's the divine
play of Krishna.

959
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,480
Bless those who give.

960
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:15,670
And also those who don t.

961
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:18,940
But whoever humiliates
me in front of my love..

962
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:21,210
..l never spare him.

963
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:25,810
Your men beat up a woman.

964
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,720
They're the public!

965
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:32,190
And those who don't respect
the public, l put them down.

966
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:35,360
Hey, you're not wearing clothes.

967
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:40,470
l am not your man, or dog.

968
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:44,700
l take bribe only
to hide your crimes.

969
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:46,500
Not to do my duty.

970
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:48,840
Mind it!

971
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:55,840
Where's everyone?

972
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:10,500
He was right here now.

973
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,900
Where's he now?

974
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:16,170
lt s the divine
play of Lord Krishna.

975
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:19,940
Seher. You're not
eating your sandwiches.

976
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:22,080
What's wrong? - Nothing.

977
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:23,870
Yeah, Seher. What's wrong?

978
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:26,240
You haven't been talking
properly with anyone.

979
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:27,570
What are you doing?

980
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:29,280
Where are you taking him?
- Leave her.

981
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:32,080
Let go. - Don't scream.

982
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:32,880
Seher!

983
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:35,320
Somebody. Please help!

984
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:45,320
Rudra.

985
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,890
You don't answer my calls.

986
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:48,640
or meet me.

987
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:51,030
And you don't want
to listen to me either.

988
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:52,730
So, l had to get you abducted.

989
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,210
What do you want to say?

990
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:56,110
Do you take bribe? - l do.

991
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,800
That's it. End of conversation.

992
01:07:58,950 --> 01:08:00,080
Seher. one minute.

993
01:08:01,590 --> 01:08:03,310
l don't need to explain to anyone..

994
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:06,180
..what or why l do anything.

995
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:09,120
But l think it's
important to tell you.

996
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:10,890
Because l love you, damn it!

997
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:13,000
lt s true that l took bribe.

998
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,660
But you didn't try
to understand why.

999
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:19,670
When l joined the
police department..

1000
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,230
..l was an honest officer.

1001
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:25,870
But in return of my honesty..

1002
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:27,530
..my seniors gave
me transfer orders.

1003
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:31,510
l would be transferred within
three months from every posting.

1004
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,650
Due to the pressure
of the politicians.

1005
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:35,080
That's when l decided..

1006
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:41,050
..that l'll have to dirty
my hands to clean this system.

1007
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:43,830
l did take bribe, Seher.

1008
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:47,090
lf l hadn't taken
bribe from Nagori..

1009
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:50,530
..l wouldn't have been able
to clean the streets of Nagapuram.

1010
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:06,410
My friends saw you two together.

1011
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:08,080
You two were in a romantic pose.

1012
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:12,590
Yes, papa.
We were in a romantic pose.

1013
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:14,850
Because l love him. - What?

1014
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:17,020
He's a thief.
He stole that bike that day.

1015
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:18,490
What do you have to say?

1016
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,020
Actually, l didn't
get an answer for that yet.

1017
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:24,460
But he did steal my heart.

1018
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,830
And l want to marry him.
- You can't marry him.

1019
01:09:28,210 --> 01:09:29,900
l mean.. Hello.
- Hello.

1020
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:30,970
Hello.

1021
01:09:31,070 --> 01:09:33,470
Aunt's looking for a Hindu,
and uncle's looking for a Muslim.

1022
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:35,740
Right. l want a
son-in-law of my caste.

1023
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:36,740
And l want one of my caste.

1024
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:38,340
Now, match this combination.

1025
01:09:38,650 --> 01:09:40,120
l'll fulfill your wish.

1026
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:41,180
How?

1027
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:44,520
My mother was a Muslim,
and my father was a Hindu.

1028
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:47,420
This is no joke.
l am a combo of the two.

1029
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,780
l'm a Hindu, and a Muslim.

1030
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,050
l don't agree. - Quiet.

1031
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:53,320
Forget religion.

1032
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:56,370
lf you hear his deeds,
you'll regret heavily.

1033
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,570
First ask him.

1034
01:09:57,630 --> 01:09:58,460
What do you do?

1035
01:09:58,540 --> 01:09:59,500
l'll tell you.

1036
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:03,440
He's a gangster. - What?

1037
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:04,830
You look like a goon.

1038
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,880
l'm just a copy, he's real.

1039
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:08,910
l'm fake, he's reality.

1040
01:10:08,980 --> 01:10:10,380
l'll tell you the reality.

1041
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:17,280
He's.. DCP..
Rudra.. Aditya.. Devraj!

1042
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:19,990
l see. So you are DCP Rudra.

1043
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:22,890
You've completely
changed Nagapuram.

1044
01:10:24,230 --> 01:10:27,250
Seher. Religion isn't important.

1045
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:30,000
His deeds are all we need.
- No, no, no.

1046
01:10:30,270 --> 01:10:31,700
This marriage isn't possible.

1047
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:34,200
lf you go ahead with it,
l will commit suicide.

1048
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:37,430
This marriage is possible
only over my dead body.

1049
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:38,740
Let's see.

1050
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:40,440
over his dead body!

1051
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:54,050
Come on.

1052
01:10:54,690 --> 01:10:56,020
You were asking about him.

1053
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:57,820
He's the bomb-maker.

1054
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,390
Nagori sir,
this mobile's fitted with a bomb.

1055
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:01,900
Keep it away.

1056
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,770
lt explodes only when you
press the green button, sir.

1057
01:11:03,870 --> 01:11:04,800
Don't worry.

1058
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:07,100
Press this green button,
and Rudra's dead.

1059
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:08,290
Tonight&

1060
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:11,840
l know when to do what.
You can leave.

1061
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,870
Here. We'll execute this
some other day, not tonight.

1062
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:16,470
Nagori sir,
what do you mean by not today?

1063
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:19,280
That Rudra humiliated you..
- He disrespected you.

1064
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:20,610
He dishonored you.

1065
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,710
He disgraced.. - Quiet!

1066
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,950
There s no tax on speaking,
so everyone s blabbering nonsense.

1067
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:27,050
l know.

1068
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:31,420
He barged in audaciously
and mortified me.

1069
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:34,860
But what did the ruling
party say just now?

1070
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,030
They've ordered a
'close-down' tomorrow.

1071
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:38,730
lf we kill Rudra today..

1072
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,670
..then everyone will think
the curfew's for his death.

1073
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:41,930
Do you want to make him a hero?

1074
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,400
Rudra's time will come.

1075
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:46,610
But this isn't the right time.

1076
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:48,300
Venkat, Prasad, listen carefully.

1077
01:11:48,650 --> 01:11:50,370
lt's the question of
the party's reputation.

1078
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:54,350
Everything should
be closed tomorrow.

1079
01:11:54,650 --> 01:11:56,920
lf anyone tries to oppose, gut him.

1080
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:58,580
Sir, please do something.

1081
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:00,250
Do something. - Hold on.

1082
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:01,410
Wait.

1083
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:03,990
Sir, it's the festival of Dussehra.

1084
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:09,620
We paid extra to stock
goods in our shops.

1085
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:12,330
But the party's announced
a 'close-down' tomorrow.

1086
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,600
So, what about us shopkeepers?

1087
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,330
Sir, l mortgaged all my jewelry..

1088
01:12:18,410 --> 01:12:20,670
..to buy stocks
for my husband's shop.

1089
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:23,400
The 'close-down' will
create problems for us.

1090
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:26,670
We'll incur great losses.

1091
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,070
Please do something.

1092
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:29,270
Do something.

1093
01:12:29,390 --> 01:12:30,550
Wait. Wait.

1094
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:33,950
Lodge your complaints.

1095
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:35,620
l'll deal with it.

1096
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:37,890
Thank you, police uncle.

1097
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,760
Tomorrow,
you'll do double business..

1098
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,460
..and we'll do double duty.
- Yes, sir.

1099
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:48,040
lf Rudra does double duty..

1100
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:51,300
..we'll create double trouble.

1101
01:12:58,050 --> 01:12:59,450
Close down the shops!

1102
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:01,210
Close down the shops!

1103
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,710
Nagori's goons are here.

1104
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:48,320
Look. Everyone.

1105
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:49,520
The DCP's here.

1106
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:50,820
Alone.

1107
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:54,000
Single entry. - Right.

1108
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:56,030
Single entry.

1109
01:13:56,610 --> 01:13:59,040
First the engine,
and then comes the bogies.

1110
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:15,550
lf you don't leave
in five minutes..

1111
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:18,230
..then l'll make you regret it.

1112
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:19,520
Two minutes.

1113
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,090
l give you two minutes.

1114
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:25,760
lf you don't leave,
then l'll make you regret it.

1115
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:27,230
What can you do?

1116
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,270
The same thing that the police do.

1117
01:14:29,370 --> 01:14:31,500
Lathi-charge. Shoot tear-gas.

1118
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:32,560
What else?

1119
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:34,470
We won't leave.

1120
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:35,810
We won't leave.

1121
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:36,970
We won't leave.

1122
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:38,640
We won't leave.

1123
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:37,740
What's this hooliganism
from the police?

1124
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:39,060
Combo.

1125
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:41,080
Buy 1 get 1 free.

1126
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:45,650
l don't use threats and truncheons.

1127
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:48,240
Follow my superior's orders.

1128
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:52,250
Shoot you, in the leg.

1129
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:53,780
Forget it.

1130
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:59,360
Now listen carefully.

1131
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:03,000
lf anyone raises their hand,
l'll break it.

1132
01:16:04,230 --> 01:16:07,360
lf you torch a bus,
l'll torch you alive.

1133
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,370
lf you kill, it's murder..

1134
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,570
..and if we kill,
we get an inquiry commission.

1135
01:16:13,010 --> 01:16:17,570
And handling the inquiry
commission is easy for me.

1136
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:20,310
There's more to
me than meets the eye.

1137
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,580
l've been transferred
here from many districts.

1138
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,610
My name's DCP Rudra.

1139
01:16:25,050 --> 01:16:27,610
Born in Mumbai,
brought up in lndia.

1140
01:16:28,890 --> 01:16:29,880
Mind it!

1141
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:32,850
Javed. - Yes.

1142
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:34,830
What's important before
doing a good deed?

1143
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:35,990
Coconut.

1144
01:16:40,670 --> 01:16:42,230
Charge!

1145
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:13,960
The avatar of Shiva
is here to save Nagapuram.

1146
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:15,730
Rudra. - Who is Rudra?

1147
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:18,140
DCP Rudra.

1148
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,140
Yes, sir. okay, sir.

1149
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:21,340
Sir, we ve just got information
from the control room.

1150
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:22,840
There's no problem
in any of the areas.

1151
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:26,080
Sir. Did the ruling party
organize this 'close-down'?

1152
01:17:26,650 --> 01:17:28,740
lt's not about ruling
party or opposition.

1153
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:30,210
lt's about right and wrong.

1154
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:31,580
l'm a public servant.

1155
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:33,150
And l protect the public.

1156
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:34,380
one more thing.

1157
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:36,250
People here are hard of hearing.

1158
01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:39,960
l would advice them to
increase the volume of their TV.

1159
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:44,500
lf someone does wrong,
l'll kill him.

1160
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:47,460
And if someone does the
right thing, l'll give him a hug.

1161
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:49,600
Sir, what's the
good news for today?

1162
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:50,670
Some good news.

1163
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:52,830
Sir's getting married
nine days later.

1164
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,980
And nine days, nine months later...

1165
01:17:56,050 --> 01:17:59,950
He just humiliated
me in the entire Nagapuram.

1166
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:04,320
He wants to weaken
my power in politics.

1167
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:06,980
l'll have to teach him.

1168
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:08,550
Wedding.

1169
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:11,920
l'll have to give him a gift.

1170
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:33,760
Do you accept it?

1171
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:34,850
l accept it.

1172
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,990
Do you accept this alliance?
- l accept it.

1173
01:21:54,650 --> 01:21:55,910
Drink poison.

1174
01:21:57,190 --> 01:21:58,650
Let the marriage get over.

1175
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,200
DCP sir.

1176
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,290
Welcome.

1177
01:24:57,930 --> 01:24:59,420
New groom..

1178
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:03,400
..here to take my blessings
after the marriage.

1179
01:25:03,970 --> 01:25:05,530
But l already sent you gifts.

1180
01:25:06,510 --> 01:25:09,170
Anyway, now you can celebrate..

1181
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,510
..the wedding and Nagapuram's
death anniversary together.

1182
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:12,700
Nagori!

1183
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:19,180
No matter how loud you scream..

1184
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:21,510
..but only my voice is heard here.

1185
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:23,020
And the lives of the people.

1186
01:25:23,690 --> 01:25:25,890
Don't they have any value?

1187
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,620
They do. But what to do?

1188
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:31,620
Since you straightened up,
so did the people of Nagapuram.

1189
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,390
They needed a wakeup call.

1190
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:34,800
So, l put everyone to sleep.

1191
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:39,940
So next time, before doing
anything, you ask me first.

1192
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:41,040
Who are you?

1193
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:43,170
Are you the Collector?
The government?

1194
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:44,440
Even bigger.

1195
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:46,340
Look at you.

1196
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:51,250
Salary, 45,000.
A uniform, a pair of shoes..

1197
01:25:51,390 --> 01:25:53,620
..and control over a few
police stations and officers.

1198
01:25:53,790 --> 01:25:55,220
Yet, you've got pride.

1199
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,310
And me.

1200
01:25:56,490 --> 01:26:01,290
l singlehandedly control
eight districts, 90 MLAs, 16 MPs..

1201
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:04,700
..and four ministers.

1202
01:26:04,830 --> 01:26:08,070
So, think about my pride.

1203
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:11,400
l may not have the
voice of Mohammad Rafi..

1204
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:13,710
..but my power's like Muhammad Ali.

1205
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:15,400
Here.

1206
01:26:16,810 --> 01:26:17,570
Power.

1207
01:26:17,650 --> 01:26:19,170
No. You simply took revenge.

1208
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:22,250
You could've taken
your revenge from me.

1209
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:26,220
You killed innocent people.
Police officers.

1210
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:28,420
You even killed children.

1211
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,890
You did what you had to do.

1212
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:34,020
Now, it's my turn.

1213
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:40,490
Eight districts,
90 MLAs, Ministers, 40 cars.

1214
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:42,700
Politician Maker title.

1215
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:48,680
l'll snatch all that from
you and throw you on the streets.

1216
01:26:49,110 --> 01:26:51,140
Just like a beggar that you were.

1217
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:58,220
And if l fail, then l won t
be called Rudra Aditya Devraj.

1218
01:26:59,990 --> 01:27:00,980
Mind it!

1219
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:09,620
You'll get your transfer
order before that.

1220
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:21,140
That's such an old dialogue.

1221
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:25,110
Everyone knew you
were going to say that.

1222
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:28,110
But today,
l've something new to say.

1223
01:27:31,290 --> 01:27:33,550
l have my transfer orders.

1224
01:27:33,990 --> 01:27:35,580
l'll be transferred in seven days.

1225
01:27:36,330 --> 01:27:39,420
But that's all l need to ruin you.

1226
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:43,390
lt'll be your empire,
but l'll chuck you out of it.

1227
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:44,520
Rudra!

1228
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:50,460
No matter how loud you scream..

1229
01:27:51,310 --> 01:27:53,800
..but my voice will be heard.

1230
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:56,100
You might have the voice of osama..

1231
01:27:57,050 --> 01:27:59,240
..but l have the power of obama.

1232
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:00,870
Combo.

1233
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:02,780
Buy 1 get 1 free.

1234
01:29:58,270 --> 01:30:00,790
You two are waiting outside?
- We are waiting for you.

1235
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:03,060
Where's Seher? - Seher?

1236
01:30:03,610 --> 01:30:06,670
Seher said you called
her to the police station.

1237
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:09,280
Two police officers were here.
They took Seher along in the jeep.

1238
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:15,310
Seher. Where are you?

1239
01:30:15,450 --> 01:30:16,650
Goons are after me.

1240
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:20,490
Where are you?
- At the end of Nehru Street.

1241
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:21,450
l see.

1242
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:22,920
There's a mosque to your left.

1243
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:24,890
l crossed it.

1244
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:29,050
There's a milk centre
in front of you. Hide there.

1245
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:30,420
Yes.

1246
01:30:31,770 --> 01:30:32,760
Where are they?

1247
01:30:37,570 --> 01:30:40,870
They left. - They'll be
back because it's a dead end.

1248
01:30:41,410 --> 01:30:44,470
Get out of there,
and run towards the main road.

1249
01:30:44,850 --> 01:30:45,840
Go!

1250
01:30:54,590 --> 01:30:55,580
Hello.

1251
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:56,710
Phone.

1252
01:30:57,830 --> 01:30:58,820
Seher.

1253
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:02,080
Rudra.

1254
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,260
People are right.

1255
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,990
No one can forget
their wedding night.

1256
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:32,550
Where are you going?

1257
01:32:32,650 --> 01:32:35,490
This is the only job
where extra hours are fun.

1258
01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:38,990
Your age's gaining mileage.

1259
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:40,950
Seher.

1260
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:45,130
Love doesn't see age,
only the waist. - l see.

1261
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:47,920
What happened?

1262
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:52,040
You're vibrating at my touch.

1263
01:32:52,410 --> 01:32:53,400
Strange.

1264
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:56,980
What's wrong? - lt's not me.

1265
01:32:57,950 --> 01:32:59,280
lt's your phone.

1266
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,680
Hello. - Sir, Javed here.

1267
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:04,620
There's bad news.

1268
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:05,980
We just received information..

1269
01:33:06,090 --> 01:33:07,890
..that someone has planted
a bomb at the bus stand.

1270
01:33:07,990 --> 01:33:09,290
We don't know what to do.

1271
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:10,480
okay.

1272
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:12,030
lnform the bomb-squad.

1273
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:15,820
Don't let the public inside.

1274
01:33:19,230 --> 01:33:20,220
l'll be right there.

1275
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:37,340
Hello. - Sir,
the bomb isn't at the bus station.

1276
01:33:37,450 --> 01:33:38,780
lt's at the railway station.

1277
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:40,790
Because the bus station
is less crowded.

1278
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:41,850
Who are you?

1279
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:04,310
Hello, DCP Rudra here.

1280
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:07,140
Hello, sir. There's a bomb
at the government hospital.

1281
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:09,620
Who are you?
- Kamla. From the market.

1282
01:34:14,190 --> 01:34:16,120
Sir, a person came
here in a hurry and asked..

1283
01:34:16,190 --> 01:34:18,420
..to tell you that
there's a bomb here.

1284
01:34:20,730 --> 01:34:22,920
Yes. Where's the bomb now?

1285
01:34:36,010 --> 01:34:38,410
Hello. - You didn't find the
bomb in Vishnu Theatre, did you?

1286
01:34:38,550 --> 01:34:42,040
But there's a bomb under the
statue opposite the petrol pump.

1287
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:52,020
Rudra.

1288
01:34:55,930 --> 01:34:59,660
Drenched in sweat,
treading on the fiery trail.

1289
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:01,770
What to do?

1290
01:35:01,870 --> 01:35:02,860
Bomb?

1291
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:04,800
Look there. There it is.

1292
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:07,100
Just like l promised,
it's under the statue.

1293
01:35:07,210 --> 01:35:08,040
Balm.

1294
01:35:08,110 --> 01:35:09,100
Tiger balm.

1295
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:12,510
You've been running around all day.

1296
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:14,410
Your legs must have grown tired.

1297
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:17,180
Apply some. Go on.

1298
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:20,520
Before that, answer the phone.

1299
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:22,950
You'll be shocked to hear
the voice on the other side.

1300
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:26,990
Hello. - Rudra,
Commissioner Trivedi here.

1301
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:27,750
Yes, sir.

1302
01:35:27,830 --> 01:35:29,590
Did you lose your mind after
getting your transfer order?

1303
01:35:29,770 --> 01:35:30,730
Why? What happened, sir?

1304
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:35,170
Are you on a road-trip with
the bomb-squad and police force?

1305
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:37,030
Sir, l received
calls of bomb threats.

1306
01:35:37,170 --> 01:35:37,800
What could l do?

1307
01:35:37,910 --> 01:35:39,900
l couldn't take a
risk with the public.

1308
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:41,470
Did you trace the call?

1309
01:35:41,810 --> 01:35:43,940
lf we attend every call..

1310
01:35:44,050 --> 01:35:46,110
..then who will do
the rest of ourjobs?

1311
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:48,350
Sir, those bomb threat
calls were right.

1312
01:35:48,820 --> 01:35:50,250
l've found the bomb, sir. - Where?

1313
01:35:50,490 --> 01:35:51,980
ln MLA Prasad's car.

1314
01:35:52,890 --> 01:35:54,910
Hello.

1315
01:35:57,090 --> 01:35:58,490
He disconnected the call.

1316
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:01,460
You have to give
respect to take respect.

1317
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:19,270
open it.

1318
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:21,770
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

1319
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:23,070
Get him out!

1320
01:36:44,910 --> 01:36:45,930
Rudra.

1321
01:36:46,710 --> 01:36:48,180
Death's never spared anyone.

1322
01:36:48,510 --> 01:36:51,640
Someday it'll be me,
but tomorrow, it's your turn.

1323
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:53,370
The commissioner.

1324
01:36:58,420 --> 01:37:00,480
Do you know what
orders l just signed?

1325
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:05,650
MLA Prasad will be
holding a procession.

1326
01:37:05,790 --> 01:37:07,820
You have to provide them security.

1327
01:37:08,700 --> 01:37:11,630
So, prepare a battalion.

1328
01:37:12,730 --> 01:37:14,600
Sir, there are chances of a riot.

1329
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:16,800
You should cancel this permission.

1330
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:18,970
You know, the orders
to sanction this permission..

1331
01:37:19,070 --> 01:37:20,370
..came from my superiors.

1332
01:37:21,010 --> 01:37:22,000
order.

1333
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:24,540
Sir, your condition
is just like a waiter s.

1334
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:26,240
All you do is take orders. - What?

1335
01:37:26,310 --> 01:37:27,910
Come here. - Yes, sir.

1336
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:31,550
What did you just say? - Sir.

1337
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,080
Before that?

1338
01:37:33,690 --> 01:37:34,680
Waiter.

1339
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,890
l am a waiter at home, not here.
- Yes, sir.

1340
01:37:37,690 --> 01:37:39,920
Rudra, this is my advice,
not an order.

1341
01:37:40,930 --> 01:37:42,830
Being enemies with
Nagori could be dangerous.

1342
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:44,490
Be his friend.

1343
01:37:45,430 --> 01:37:46,420
Sir.

1344
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:49,000
Too many chocolates
can lead to diabetes.

1345
01:37:49,770 --> 01:37:51,930
Too much alcohol, liver trouble.

1346
01:37:52,470 --> 01:37:54,640
And being friends with
me can lead to enemies.

1347
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:02,110
Talking to him means
getting a headache.

1348
01:38:11,090 --> 01:38:13,190
This is what you need
to do before you kill them.

1349
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:16,330
We'll have to follow
this plan together.

1350
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:19,400
Because this entire
conspiracy is to kill me.

1351
01:38:20,870 --> 01:38:22,390
Tomorrow,
it could be your turn, Javed.

1352
01:38:22,570 --> 01:38:24,660
Then you. You.

1353
01:38:25,010 --> 01:38:26,000
And you.

1354
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:30,040
on the way, you'll come
across Rajappa's cold drink stall.

1355
01:38:30,910 --> 01:38:34,210
Goons will be supplied cold
drink bottles from that shop.

1356
01:38:35,150 --> 01:38:36,550
That will be their first weapon.

1357
01:38:36,690 --> 01:38:38,310
Ten steps ahead, you'll
come across an iron workshop.

1358
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:39,380
lt belongs to Peter.

1359
01:38:39,550 --> 01:38:42,550
He'll supply abundant
knifes and axes.

1360
01:38:43,190 --> 01:38:46,130
We'll strike before
the iron is hot.

1361
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:47,790
He can't shoot.

1362
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:49,990
Rudra won't get shooting
orders tomorrow.

1363
01:38:50,230 --> 01:38:52,130
Because l've sent the
Collector on a holiday.

1364
01:38:52,430 --> 01:38:54,900
l won't need the
Collector's permission.

1365
01:38:55,540 --> 01:38:58,170
Because l know how to do
the right thing the wrong way.

1366
01:38:59,470 --> 01:39:02,570
The right time will be
when you pass the petrol pump.

1367
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:08,340
We'll surround Rudra and
his men and kill them publicly.

1368
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:10,910
No one will stop you there.

1369
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:14,280
lf there's anyone who can ruin
our plan, then that's the press.

1370
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:17,760
And we have to stop them
from taking photos and videos.

1371
01:39:18,430 --> 01:39:20,330
ls that understood? - Yes, sir.

1372
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:24,660
Javed. - Sir.

1373
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:28,760
Are the market people with us?
- Why, sir?

1374
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:33,100
Because tomorrow..
old scores will be settled.

1375
01:39:52,030 --> 01:39:53,190
Are you ready?

1376
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:55,080
We've crossed the mosque.

1377
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:56,960
Get the weapons from Peter's shop.

1378
01:40:02,570 --> 01:40:03,560
Just a minute.

1379
01:40:04,210 --> 01:40:06,870
Rudra. Why did
you divert the route?

1380
01:40:07,110 --> 01:40:08,670
The road's closed ahead.

1381
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:10,540
But it wasn't dug-up
until yesterday.

1382
01:40:10,610 --> 01:40:12,100
But it is today. Let's go that way.

1383
01:40:12,310 --> 01:40:13,680
No, this is a conspiracy.

1384
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:15,680
Police cruelty!

1385
01:40:17,190 --> 01:40:18,650
Police cruelty!

1386
01:40:19,350 --> 01:40:20,580
Police cruelty!

1387
01:40:21,290 --> 01:40:22,550
Police cruelty!

1388
01:40:22,690 --> 01:40:24,960
Padam. We won't get anything here.

1389
01:40:25,290 --> 01:40:26,520
Call up our men.

1390
01:40:26,660 --> 01:40:27,860
Ask them to join us.

1391
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:29,090
Let's cross the petrol pump first.

1392
01:40:29,230 --> 01:40:30,790
lt'll be easier to kill Rudra then.

1393
01:40:37,470 --> 01:40:38,460
Call him.

1394
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:42,980
Rudra will die today.

1395
01:40:49,650 --> 01:40:52,450
Police cruelty!

1396
01:40:56,890 --> 01:40:58,980
Yes, sir.
We're close to the petrol pump.

1397
01:40:59,630 --> 01:41:01,030
Just give us a missed call.

1398
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:02,690
ls everyone ready?

1399
01:41:03,030 --> 01:41:04,120
They're coming.

1400
01:41:10,470 --> 01:41:12,700
Police cruelty!

1401
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:17,640
Police cruelty!

1402
01:41:18,610 --> 01:41:21,050
Beat him!

1403
01:41:21,150 --> 01:41:24,880
Don t spare them. Beat them.

1404
01:41:38,130 --> 01:41:39,660
Charge!

1405
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:04,490
Tear gas.

1406
01:42:43,830 --> 01:42:45,800
You raped my sister!

1407
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:47,190
Rascal!

1408
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,900
Do you know what you did?
We'll teach you.

1409
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:18,590
Arrest them!

1410
01:43:22,740 --> 01:43:24,570
Here's my gun, sir.
Fully loaded.

1411
01:43:25,010 --> 01:43:27,570
How can l shoot when
l didn't get the orders?

1412
01:43:29,110 --> 01:43:30,270
What are you looking at, sir?

1413
01:43:31,150 --> 01:43:32,940
l doubt your intentions.

1414
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:34,480
Shut up! Damn it!

1415
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:35,740
This is serious.

1416
01:43:36,220 --> 01:43:38,450
Many people died.
one of them was an MLA.

1417
01:43:39,250 --> 01:43:41,720
lf you didn't shoot, then who did?

1418
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:44,280
Sir, how would l know..

1419
01:43:44,390 --> 01:43:45,980
..who opened fire
in that huge crowd?

1420
01:43:46,490 --> 01:43:48,290
The CBl is handling this case.

1421
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:51,620
l did tell you to
cancel that procession.

1422
01:43:53,170 --> 01:43:55,260
Fine, release those two MLAs.
- okay, sir.

1423
01:43:55,870 --> 01:43:58,430
Give me written permission
that you take responsibility.

No, sir. l want to save you.

1427
01:44:04,110 --> 01:44:05,600
As long as this matter

..let those two stay inside.

1429

Look, Rudra..

01:44:19,230 --> 01:44:20,820
..don't lock horns with Nagori.

1434
01:44:21,330 --> 01:44:22,760
When you shatter the glass..

1435
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:26,900
..it's you who gets hurt,
not the glass.

1436
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:32,870
Sir, this uniform is no
less than a bulletproofjacket.

1437
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:37,070
No one can dare to touch it,
and live.

1438
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,520
Hello, sir. - What hello?

1439
01:44:49,790 --> 01:44:52,260
He's bumping my men,
and you're saluting me.

1440
01:44:52,330 --> 01:44:53,320
Shoot me!

1441
01:44:53,390 --> 01:44:56,800
Nagori sir.
Their guns don't have bullets.

1442
01:44:56,860 --> 01:44:58,200
lt's just a show-piece.

1443
01:45:00,070 --> 01:45:02,730
ln Rudra Devraj's reign,
everything's loaded.

Nunu.

1445

Are you here to surrender? - No.

01:45:22,490 --> 01:45:24,220
To write your biography.

1447
01:45:24,430 --> 01:45:25,950
You're a goon, not an officer.

1448
01:45:26,290 --> 01:45:28,190
You're no combo.
you're like the congo drums.

1449
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:29,560
You've been beating everyone up.

1450
01:45:30,130 --> 01:45:32,100
He shot my men.

1451
01:45:32,170 --> 01:45:34,630
Hey. No need to tell them.

l did it with their help.

1453
01:45:37,970 --> 01:45:39,300
What are you supporting him for?

1454
01:45:39,470 --> 01:45:41,530
You think he's honest, sincere?

1455
01:45:41,710 --> 01:45:45,150
Nunu. You killed
people at the market.

1456
01:45:45,410 --> 01:45:47,350
And l killed your
men on the streets.

1457

And those l killed&

1458
01:45:49,450 --> 01:45:52,040
Do you have a record?  No, sir.

1459
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:54,080
You will pay.

1460
01:45:54,490 --> 01:45:55,980
You will pay for your deeds.

1461
01:45:56,120 --> 01:45:57,150
What will you say next?

1462
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:59,090
My Karan and Arjun
will definitely return.

1463
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:00,620
Get lost.

1464
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:03,690
Rascal. You dare point
a finger at Nagori Subramanium.

1465
01:46:03,770 --> 01:46:06,000
Lower your finger.
Don't talk to me like that.

1466
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:25,820
You're finished.

1467
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:30,020
Your entire empire's.. finished.

1469
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:36,030
Four days later,
you'll be licking this.

This.

1471
01:46:38,370 --> 01:46:40,130
You'll be begging for your life.

1472
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:41,830
And do you know
what l'm going to say?

1473

Actually, sir, this city's
made me hard of hearing.

1600
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:39,540
Rudra!

1601
01:54:40,450 --> 01:54:43,580
lf you arrest him,
it'll create problems for us.

1602
01:54:43,820 --> 01:54:46,050
But you'll have more
problems than you can handle.

1603
01:54:46,150 --> 01:54:48,420
No ordinary MP can
spell trouble for me.

1604
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:51,990
You can all lick Nagori's boots.

1605
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:53,630
But l will make
him lick the ground.

1606
01:54:53,690 --> 01:54:54,630
Rudra.

1607
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,290
You can't talk to the MP like that.

1608
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:58,960
How else do you want
me to talk to him, sir?

1609
01:54:59,270 --> 01:55:00,820
Anyone who supports a man..

1610
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:03,760
..who's got a warrant against
him under Terrorist Act..

1611
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:06,540
..l'll use this language for him.

1612
01:55:06,610 --> 01:55:08,970
Fine, we admit we're
supporting Nagori.

1613
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:12,040
We also admit that we're wrong,
corrupt.

1614
01:55:12,310 --> 01:55:14,180
You aren't honest either.

1615
01:55:14,980 --> 01:55:17,680
You've taken millions
from Nagori as bribe.

1616
01:55:18,950 --> 01:55:22,650
Nagori's maintained
your account in this file.

1617
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:26,360
The amount and the number of times.
The date.

1618
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:28,230
He has the entire account.

1619
01:55:28,430 --> 01:55:30,520
He's taken your photos
from his cell phone.

1620
01:55:30,860 --> 01:55:32,830
Look. There's the evidence.

1621
01:55:33,470 --> 01:55:35,330
His men are good photographers.

1622
01:55:35,470 --> 01:55:38,300
Now you'll say that you
didn't take 5.5 million from him.

1623
01:55:39,070 --> 01:55:40,170
No, sir.

1624
01:55:40,610 --> 01:55:43,300
l took 5.75 million from him.

1625
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:46,880
Here.

1626
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:49,010
Match my accounts with his.

1627
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:50,980
lt contains government receipts..

1628
01:55:51,090 --> 01:55:52,950
..for all the days
l took money from him.

1629
01:55:54,020 --> 01:55:55,450
First receipt's
in the name of Nagori.

1630
01:55:55,820 --> 01:55:57,920
So that another beggar
doesn't turn rabid like him.

1631
01:55:58,530 --> 01:56:00,930
2 million for the
Beggar Relief fund.

1632
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:04,020
Nagori burnt down many houses.

1633
01:56:04,770 --> 01:56:07,360
So, 1 million for the
contract to make new houses.

1634
01:56:07,870 --> 01:56:09,730
He orphaned many people.

1635
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:12,200
So, l donated millions
in the orphanages.

1636
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:15,530
And then,
he cheated the government as well.

1637
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:19,010
So, l donated some money in
the Chief Minister's Relief fund.

1638
01:56:21,550 --> 01:56:23,540
Sir, all his accounts
are clear in this file.

1639
01:56:23,620 --> 01:56:25,110
Just a minute.

1640
01:56:25,620 --> 01:56:29,250
What about the 15 million
that he took for the accident case?

1641
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:30,520
Yes, what about that?

1642
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:33,590
The culprit in an accident case is
sentenced to three months ofjail..

1643
01:56:33,890 --> 01:56:36,120
..and fined 50,000 rupees.

1644
01:56:36,460 --> 01:56:39,430
But what about the
deceased victim's family?

1645
01:56:40,070 --> 01:56:42,330
l gave 1.5 million
to the victim's family.

1646
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:43,560
You can ask them.

1647
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:45,140
l am a public servant.

1648
01:56:45,540 --> 01:56:46,970
l'll serve only the public.

1649
01:56:47,310 --> 01:56:48,300
Mind it.

1650
01:56:48,940 --> 01:56:50,670
Are you a police officer or a goon?

1651
01:56:52,410 --> 01:56:53,470
Combo!

1652
01:56:55,380 --> 01:56:57,410
What are you saying, Rudra?

1653
01:56:57,580 --> 01:56:59,380
You want to uphold the law.

1654
01:56:59,450 --> 01:57:00,920
What the&

1655
01:57:03,060 --> 01:57:04,550
What law?

1656
01:57:05,130 --> 01:57:06,990
one that keeps changing
from state to state.

1657
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:11,250
lt's illegal to drink liquor
in one state, and legal in another.

1658
01:57:11,570 --> 01:57:15,730
Prostitution's legal in one,
and illegal in another.

1659
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:18,100
Every caste has a different law.

1660
01:57:19,170 --> 01:57:21,840
And every state
has a different rule.

1661
01:57:22,310 --> 01:57:25,510
l work according to my rules,
not the law.

1662
01:57:25,750 --> 01:57:28,580
Just like you, we do as we please.

1663
01:57:28,750 --> 01:57:30,220
And we'll do the same with you.

1664
01:57:30,350 --> 01:57:32,220
What we'll do to
you will be really bad.

1665
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:34,440
Are you threatening
me or scaring me?

1666
01:57:34,590 --> 01:57:36,320
Just telling you
what's going to happen.

1667
01:57:36,620 --> 01:57:38,720
What if we arrest Nagori?

1668
01:57:38,860 --> 01:57:40,830
Then we'll kill you right now.

1669
01:57:40,890 --> 01:57:43,520
Try and touch me.

1670
01:57:45,170 --> 01:57:46,860
The entire police
department's with us.

1671
01:57:46,970 --> 01:57:48,430
They will follow our orders.

1672
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:50,670
of course they will, Mr. Collector.

1673
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:52,270
Does anyone else
have anything to say?

1674
01:57:52,470 --> 01:57:54,440
Go ahead. Say it.

1675
01:57:54,710 --> 01:57:57,800
Now, our weapons will speak for us.

1676
01:57:58,210 --> 01:58:02,110
We can decide your fate right now.

1677
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:09,950
Great.

1678
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:11,950
That's the end of today's show.

1679
01:58:12,730 --> 01:58:14,160
This much footage is enough.

1680
01:58:14,860 --> 01:58:16,190
Footage? - Yes.

1681
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:18,320
Everything you said..

1682
01:58:18,830 --> 01:58:22,290
..has been recorded in
this 4.5 megapixel camera.

1683
01:58:22,900 --> 01:58:23,890
oh, no!

1684
01:58:23,970 --> 01:58:26,000
This is just like me. Combo.

1685
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:28,600
lt writes and records too.

1686
01:58:31,550 --> 01:58:34,570
Wow! What clarity.

1687
01:58:35,820 --> 01:58:39,050
They wanted to kill the
DCP in the Commissioner's office.

1688
01:58:40,950 --> 01:58:41,940
What's this?

1689
01:58:42,590 --> 01:58:44,020
Such dangerous weapons&

1690
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:47,090
ln the police headquarters.

1691
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:49,020
ls this ajoke?

1692
01:58:49,430 --> 01:58:50,450
This is disgraceful.

1693
01:58:50,630 --> 01:58:53,120
Weapons here,
with this high security.

1694
01:58:53,630 --> 01:58:55,730
Foreign powers can
infiltrate us too.

1695
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:57,130
What's this?

1696
01:58:57,200 --> 01:58:59,330
Why did the government
award you with these stars?

1697
01:58:59,610 --> 01:59:01,800
You get salary. Hog for free.

1698
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:04,300
Ripping off the government.

1699
01:59:04,710 --> 01:59:05,870
You should be ashamed.

1700
01:59:08,220 --> 01:59:09,200
Rudra.

1701
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:10,270
Sit down, son.

1702
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:11,680
We will sort it out.

1703
01:59:11,890 --> 01:59:12,940
We will discuss it.

1704
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:14,990
No more discussions.

1705
01:59:15,420 --> 01:59:17,390
l'm going to arrest Rudra.

1706
01:59:17,990 --> 01:59:19,790
From the media to the Assembly..

1707
01:59:20,230 --> 01:59:22,160
..anyone who wants
to ruin his reputation..

1708
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:24,130
..can try and stop me.

1709
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:28,090
Mind it.

1710
01:59:42,420 --> 01:59:43,640
Sir, my pen.

1711
01:59:50,260 --> 01:59:51,250
Thank you.

1712
02:00:03,240 --> 02:00:04,830
You can't do anything.

1713
02:00:04,910 --> 02:00:06,740
Give the phone to
Minister Raghupati.

1714
02:00:06,940 --> 02:00:07,930
Take this.

1715
02:00:09,480 --> 02:00:10,470
Number two?

1716
02:00:10,980 --> 02:00:13,470
Hello. The minister's
pissed in his pants.

1717
02:00:13,610 --> 02:00:14,100
What?

1718
02:00:14,210 --> 02:00:15,910
l mean, he's taking a leak.

1719
02:00:16,220 --> 02:00:18,620
Look, don't worry.
lt's just a matter of one day.

1720
02:00:18,890 --> 02:00:20,290
Rudra will be transferred tomorrow.

1721
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:23,150
And the new officer
will be in our control.

1722
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:27,220
Just go stay with your
uncle for a day in Murshidabad.

1723
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:29,920
Commissioner. - l'm sorry, sir.

1724
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:32,190
We're helpless.

1725
02:00:39,940 --> 02:00:42,530
Nagori sir. The police
are patrolling Nagapuram borders.

1726
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:44,640
lt's difficult to flee.

1727
02:01:17,180 --> 02:01:18,270
We checked many cars, sir.

1728
02:01:18,380 --> 02:01:19,500
We've arrested many of his men.

1729
02:01:19,710 --> 02:01:21,200
But there's no trace of Nagori.

1730
02:01:21,480 --> 02:01:23,210
Check every car. - okay, sir.

1731
02:01:23,550 --> 02:01:24,780
Block all posts.

1732
02:01:32,030 --> 02:01:33,220
What happened? Did they speak?

1733
02:01:33,490 --> 02:01:35,190
l beat them black and blue, sir.

1734
02:01:35,300 --> 02:01:36,960
But no one's speaking up.

1735
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:40,290
l think they don't
know anything about Nagori.

1736
02:01:48,740 --> 02:01:50,510
Sir, you're getting
transferred tomorrow..

1737
02:01:50,580 --> 02:01:52,510
..and Nagori's not
been arrested yet.

1738
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:54,910
Have the police lost?

1739
02:01:56,320 --> 02:01:59,410
Winning and losing is
decided when we play the game.

1740
02:01:59,650 --> 02:02:01,350
But Nagori turned
out to be a fugitive.

1741
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:03,650
His cowardice is my victory. - Sir.

1742
02:02:04,220 --> 02:02:06,920
What should we print now?
- The truth.

1743
02:02:14,870 --> 02:02:18,860
DCP Rudra has received
Nagori's arrest warrant.

1744
02:02:19,170 --> 02:02:21,200
But he hasn't
apprehended Nagori yet.

1745
02:02:21,480 --> 02:02:22,530
He's still at large.

1746
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:25,640
The police department's making
failed attempts to find him.

1747
02:02:27,450 --> 02:02:28,570
Seher, what's this?

1748
02:02:29,020 --> 02:02:31,350
So far from the city,
and this temple.

1749
02:02:31,490 --> 02:02:33,510
Yes. That's the
specialty of this temple.

1750
02:02:33,690 --> 02:02:36,280
Every prayer has been answered.

1751
02:02:37,060 --> 02:02:40,030
l venerated Lord Shiva,
and found Rudra.

1752
02:02:44,870 --> 02:02:46,660
Your prayers have been answered..

1753
02:02:47,970 --> 02:02:50,700
..but mine's yet to be.

1754
02:02:51,640 --> 02:02:55,130
Bow before Him,
because fate bows before Him.

1755
02:03:14,290 --> 02:03:17,860
Spare me some change
in the name of God.

1756
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,020
God will bless you.

1757
02:03:20,300 --> 02:03:21,600
Didn't l tell you?

1758
02:03:22,170 --> 02:03:24,030
l've no change.
Pardon me, Nunu.

1759
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:29,100
How did you know?

1760
02:03:31,650 --> 02:03:34,050
'Rudra. There are too
many beggars here these days.'

1761
02:03:38,390 --> 02:03:39,610
l've been noticing..

1762
02:03:40,290 --> 02:03:42,590
..one of the beggars is
having a problem in sitting down.

1763
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:44,180
That's when l remembered.

1764
02:03:44,490 --> 02:03:45,750
You're suffering from piles.

1765
02:03:49,430 --> 02:03:53,300
Didn't l tell you that one day,
l'd chuck you out on the street?

1766
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:55,090
l am on the street.

1767
02:03:56,100 --> 02:03:59,700
But this is where
l am going to bury you.

1768
02:04:00,010 --> 02:04:02,910
Because, l am a mountain.

1769
02:04:03,080 --> 02:04:05,270
lf you're a mountain, l am Hanuman.

1770
02:04:05,750 --> 02:04:08,370
And Hanuman picks
up mountains on his palm.

1771
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:11,850
Deal with them first.

1772
02:04:15,390 --> 02:04:16,510
First, deal with this.

1773
02:04:16,790 --> 02:04:18,990
Move back! Move back!

1774
02:04:53,930 --> 02:04:54,860

1775
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:56,990

TEAM DDH~RG

1777
02:08:50,660 --> 02:08:52,630
Hey. Stop it!

1778
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:54,820
That's enough.

1779
02:08:55,740 --> 02:08:58,100
Go ahead. Arrest me.

1780
02:08:58,670 --> 02:09:00,040
But remember.

1781
02:09:00,540 --> 02:09:02,910
The new DCP will arrive soon.

1782
02:09:03,510 --> 02:09:04,770
He'll let me out.

1783
02:09:06,050 --> 02:09:09,410
And then.. l won't spare you.

1784
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:12,250
l won't spare you.

1785
02:09:20,430 --> 02:09:25,490
Nagori. l know you have power,
money, politicians.

1786
02:09:25,970 --> 02:09:30,400
But l have the public.
And they love me.

1787
02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:34,470
And that's why l won't arrest you,
but kill you instead.

1788
02:09:35,340 --> 02:09:37,140
No. No.

1789
02:09:37,380 --> 02:09:38,280
Don't kill me.

1790
02:09:38,340 --> 02:09:39,370
Don't kill me.

1791
02:09:39,610 --> 02:09:41,550
You're the hero. l'm the villain.

1792
02:09:41,710 --> 02:09:43,440
Why are you killing
me like a villain?

1793
02:09:43,820 --> 02:09:46,450
l'll give you billions.

1794
02:09:48,990 --> 02:09:50,320
Nagori.

1795
02:09:50,760 --> 02:09:54,020
For the first time, l ve seen
a beggar that's offering money.

1796
02:09:54,090 --> 02:09:55,820
Whatever.

1797
02:09:55,960 --> 02:09:57,760
You're my brother. Brother.

1798
02:09:57,830 --> 02:10:00,600
That's why..
you'll do the same thing with me..

1799
02:10:00,700 --> 02:10:03,070
..that you did with your brother.

1800
02:10:04,870 --> 02:10:07,100
You know that l
killed my own brother.

1801
02:10:07,340 --> 02:10:08,240
Don't kill me.

1802
02:10:08,310 --> 02:10:10,970
What's so special about
me that you want to kill me?

1803
02:10:12,810 --> 02:10:14,470
You're right. - Yes.

1804
02:10:14,850 --> 02:10:16,040
You're right.

1805
02:10:17,180 --> 02:10:21,680
lf l kill you, your politician
friends will make a statue of you.

1806
02:10:22,320 --> 02:10:23,450
They will make you famous.

1807
02:10:24,160 --> 02:10:25,020
They'll make you a hero.

1808
02:10:25,130 --> 02:10:26,390
You're intelligent.

1809
02:10:26,630 --> 02:10:28,120
Get one thing straight, Nagori.

1810
02:10:28,830 --> 02:10:30,260
You're a fugitive.

1811
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,520
Didn't you see it in
newspapers and television?

1812
02:10:33,930 --> 02:10:35,700
That's what l want
the people to know.

1813
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:40,330
A Politician Maker was scared
of the police and ran away.

1814
02:10:40,870 --> 02:10:45,040
And this fear won't
let another Nagori be born.

1815
02:10:45,380 --> 02:10:46,370
Get that.

1816
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:50,980
What are you going to do?

1817
02:10:51,620 --> 02:10:53,640
Don't keep me in suspense.

1818
02:10:55,460 --> 02:10:56,890
What are you going to do?

1819
02:10:58,220 --> 02:10:59,780
What's going to happen?

1820
02:11:00,860 --> 02:11:02,520
Why is the jeep still running?

1821
02:11:03,330 --> 02:11:04,630
What's going to happen to me?

1822
02:11:04,900 --> 02:11:05,890
Tell me.

1823
02:11:08,770 --> 02:11:09,760
Nagori.

1824
02:11:10,340 --> 02:11:11,930
Combo.

1825
02:11:14,240 --> 02:11:15,760
Not the police and gangster.

1826
02:11:16,010 --> 02:11:17,870
But Hindu and Muslim.

1827
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:22,970
l'll set you ablaze,
and bury your story forever.

1828
02:11:23,150 --> 02:11:24,980
