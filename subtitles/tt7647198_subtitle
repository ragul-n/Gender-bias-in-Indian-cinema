1
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,330
Take me to Sion, please.

2
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,790
-What?
-Sion. Let's go.

3
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,330
No, I won't go in that direction.
It's very crowded at this time.

4
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:51,830
Please, take me there

5
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,160
otherwise I'll have to look
for another auto rickshaw.

6
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,290
How will I reach there?

7
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,870
I'll pay you extra.

8
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,620
I don't care if you pay me extra or not.

9
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,370
I said I won't go. Get down and
find another auto rickshaw.

10
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,750
You're available.
Please, let's go.

11
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,200
I have to buy medicines for my mother.

12
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,950
Fine, but that place
is usually crowded at this time

13
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,700
and I won't find a passenger
while returning.

14
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,580
Fine, I'll pay you return fare as well.

15
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,410
Please, take me there.
I want to buy medicines.

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,450
Please, let's go.

17
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,910
Okay, sir. I am only going
because it's an emergency.

18
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,700
I don't go in that direction usually.

19
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,830
Now hurry up.

20
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,200
Here we are. Hold on.

21
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,370
Hold on.

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,250
-How much did you lend me?
-I gave you 400 bucks.

23
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,950
Four hundred bucks.
And your fare is 450 bucks.

24
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,620
-225 bucks is your return fare.
-Yes.

25
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,830
So the total is 1075 bucks.

26
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,580
Here is 2000 bucks and I'll need 75 more.

27
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,080
-I'll go and get it.
-That's not a big deal.

28
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,450
You're paying me return fare after all.

29
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,750
But that's not fair. You helped me out.

30
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,750
I'll pay you the entire fare.

31
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,290
-You brought me here. You helped me.
-But 75 bucks is not...

32
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,200
If I run into you again tomorrow,
will you help me? You won't.

33
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,290
But, I have to go.

34
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,500
Look, I'll give you the entire fare.
1075 bucks.

35
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,950
Look... Do you see that building?
I have an apartment in it.

36
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,500
I'll get it right away. Just give me
a minute. I'll pay you 1075 bucks.

37
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,660
Let it be, sir.

38
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,450
Just give me a minute, buddy.
Just a minute.

39
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,500
I'll be right back.

40
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,580
Please hurry up, sir.

41
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,540
Just a minute, I'll be right back.

42
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,540
Yes, Mom!

43
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,200
Give me a cup of tea, please.

44
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,500
So he fooled you too?

45
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,700
What do you mean?

46
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,790
That guy.

47
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,290
-That guy?
-You mean that guy?

48
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,200
Yes, he's the one.

49
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,330
He's no gentleman.

50
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,950
This is how he cheats people.

51
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,330
He uses the excuse of
his mother's illness...

52
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,040
and brings auto rickshaw drivers
all the way here.

53
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,250
He takes their money and runs away.

54
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,580
I guess he gave you a similar excuse.

55
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,500
The auto rickshaw driver
who came before you

56
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,910
paid for his beer,
and lent him more money.

57
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,370
And he didn't pay his fare
that time either.

58
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,540
-At least have a cup of tea.
-Yeah, yeah. Make it.

59
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,620
I'll also make a <i>paan</i> for you.

60
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,830
So, you're getting married?

61
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,080
His mom has chosen a girl for him.

62
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,660
Your life is about to get ruined.

63
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,080
Why? Did your life get ruined?

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes, it did.

65
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,830
Before his wedding,

66
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,700
he would come here every evening
with a bottle of beer.

67
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,000
I've been calling him for almost a month
but he only showed up now.

68
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,500
And do you know why?

69
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,080
Because his wife is visiting her parents.

70
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,700
Am I lying?

71
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,700
See, right in the pocket.

72
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,250
Son, sex isn't like a game of carom
where you can get it in a single stroke.

73
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,790
You'll be totally screwed
and then we will talk.

74
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,040
No one ever got screwed, understand.

75
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,910
This is all nonsense.

76
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,160
You make it sound like
you've fucked a lot of girls.

77
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,580
He's telling the truth.

78
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,870
What will you do on your wedding night?

79
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,790
Tell me. Do you know anything?

80
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,540
I know everything.

81
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,250
-I've seen a lot of porn movies.
-Hey.

82
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,750
Oh, God!

83
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,370
Get lost!

84
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,500
If you try to replicate them,

85
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:13,160
she will kick you out
on your first night itself.

86
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,830
He is all words and no action.

87
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,370
-Why?
-Why?

88
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,750
"I am a Brahmin.

89
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,750
It's a sin for us to even look at girls."

90
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,370
Etcetera, etcetera...

91
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,200
So what's wrong with that?

92
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,410
-I am a Brahmin.
-Yeah.

93
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,540
What's wrong with that?

94
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,040
We're taught to respect women
and not to ogle at them.

95
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,660
This is what my mother always taught me.

96
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,410
Your mother told you
not to stare at girls.

97
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,660
But she said nothing about watching
nude girls in those films?

98
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,660
Those girls are not from our country.

99
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,200
"They are not from our country!"

100
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,160
Bastard.

101
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,160
After marriage...

102
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,250
it's important to keep your wife happy.

103
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,000
You understand what I mean?

104
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,410
If you fail...

105
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,620
she will immediately
look for other options.

106
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,540
And then you will keep jerking off.
Do you get it?

107
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,120
Shukla, he's right.

108
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,660
A woman can endure anything.

109
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,040
She can stay hungry
or even put up with torture.

110
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,620
-Very true.
-But she needs a really good sex life.

111
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,580
-Absolutely.
-Absolutely.

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,080
If you fail in that,
then you have no chance.

113
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,870
Everything gets ruined.

114
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,620
You asshole... shut up.

115
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,450
Stop teaching me wisdom.

116
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,120
Look at yourself.

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,250
You've been jerking off all your life.

118
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,250
You will never find a girl for yourself.

119
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,000
Now that I am getting one,
you're jealous.

120
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,700
Everyone says that, man.

121
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,410
But the real test begins
when it's time to have sex.

122
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,290
I have a friend.

123
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,750
-When he had sex for the first time...
-What?

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,410
-He was down with fever for two days.
-Oh no.

125
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,660
-He got an infection.
-What's wrong?

126
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,080
-Infection?
-Really?

127
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,870
Okay.

128
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,540
If that's the case, then I'll clean
my wife with Dettol every day.

129
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,080
What?

130
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,790
Nonsense.

131
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,160
What do you keep thinking about?

132
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,450
Vim!

133
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,910
Look, I'll keep my wife happy
physically...

134
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,080
and emotionally too.

135
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,500
If you ever face a problem,
then do let me know.

136
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,000
I'll start coming over to your house
to watch television.

137
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,910
If I see you anywhere near my house,

138
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,700
I will kill you.

139
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,410
I won't let you even look at her.

140
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,910
In fact, I won't let anyone of you
come near her.

141
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,370
No one.

142
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,040
None of you are trustworthy.

143
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,250
And as far as my kids are concerned...

144
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,160
-My kids...
-Careful.

145
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,160
My kids will only be mine.

146
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,160
-Just mine.
-Hey!

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,830
-What an idiot!
-Get lost!

148
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,370
-Get down.
-Step down, drunkard!

149
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,040
-Step down. Drunkard!
-I won't.

150
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,500
You broke the light.
How are we going to play now?

151
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,540
<i>The bride entered the house.*
Stop beating the drums.</i>

152
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,250
<i>Pack everything
and put in the car.</i>

153
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,290
<i>The other party is waiting for us.
Let's move.</i>

154
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,660
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

155
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,580
Why have you gathered here? Leave.

156
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,950
You can come and see her tomorrow.
She won't change.

157
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,330
Get going? Leave.

158
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,330
They're crowding the place.

159
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,450
You, idiot. What are you still doing here?

160
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,950
You think your mother is dancing here?

161
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,700
Go!

162
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:00,200
Dear God!

163
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,410
God.

164
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,250
Your wedding was really stressful.

165
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,830
Lakshmi, get me a glass of water.

166
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,660
You're too much.

167
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,160
She just got here and
you're asking her to fetch water.

168
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,000
How would she know where is the water
and where are the glasses?

169
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,120
Of course, your house is so big!

170
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,950
She wouldn't know where water is!

171
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,750
If you feel so offended,
then go get it yourself.

172
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,750
You know where the glasses are
and where the water is kept.

173
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,500
Look at him!

174
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,330
He has started taunting his mother
the moment his wife stepped in.

175
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,620
Give it, Lakshmi.

176
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,120
Your father-in-law
drinks tea at this time.

177
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,080
Can you make some?

178
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,950
Oh, God!

179
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,910
<i>Radha, did you call me?</i>

180
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,000
Listen.

181
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,830
What do you think?

182
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,700
You think Rohit must've left her?

183
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,500
Of course, he did.

184
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,790
He had already left her.

185
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,500
<i>I've got nothing to do
with your factory, Rishabh.</i>

186
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,080
<i>But I can easily save you from this mess.</i>

187
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,660
<i>How, Radha? How?</i>

188
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,500
<i>I have a condition for you.</i>

189
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,120
<i>A condition?</i>

190
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,910
<i>You will have to accept me as your wife.</i>

191
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,700
Oh, God!

192
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,910
-Shruti is such a bitch!
<i>-What are you saying. Shruti?</i>

193
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,410
<i>...Shruti?</i>

194
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,370
She doesn't care
about her father's factory.

195
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,830
All she wants is Prashant.

196
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,620
The only agenda of these witches
is to ruin the family.

197
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,790
<i>-And on the other hand is Radha.</i>

198
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,500
I always knew this would happen.

199
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,370
<i>Prashant, today you have to decide
if you want to save Radha or the factory.</i>

200
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,910
-Didn't I tell you this would happen?
-<i>Just friends.</i>

201
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,080
-<i>...please marry me.</i>
-I knew this would happen.

202
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,370
<i>-I'll give you Dr. Hiranandani's number.</i>
-See...

203
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,410
<i>He is a cardiologist.</i>

204
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,580
Look at what she's doing.

205
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,290
<i>-I want to study, manage business...</i>
-Move aside.

206
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,660
<i>Why are we suddenly
talking about the wedding?</i>

207
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,700
Are you going to watch TV all night?
Don't you want to sleep?

208
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,330
<i>What about this kid, Sunny?</i>

209
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,580
Go and sleep.

210
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,700
<i>Why are you doing this, Sunny?</i>

211
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,660
Why did you get me married
in the first place?

212
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,950
<i>-Only for your love...</i>
-Don't get desperate.

213
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,370
You won't die if you wait for a few days.

214
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,200
The priest said
it's not an auspicious time.

215
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,450
<i>What about the kid, Sunny?</i>

216
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,370
Now go!

217
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,080
<i>I did everything you asked me to.</i>

218
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,040
<i>This is our kid.</i>

219
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,410
-One won't find peace in this house.
<i>-You don't understand.</i>

220
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,160
<i>We will have to get married, Sunny.</i>

221
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,540
I'll break the TV one day!

222
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,290
Then I'll see what you watch.

223
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,080
-TV is all you care about.
<i>-What will I tell my parents?</i>

224
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,950
<i>You want to study
and want to go to Oxford.</i>

225
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,830
<i>Sunny, what about this child in my womb?</i>

226
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,330
<i>Why are you doing this, Sunny?</i>

227
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,200
<i>I did everything you asked me to.
This is our kid.</i>

228
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,660
<i>Sunny... Three months have passed.
We have to get married, Sunny.</i>

229
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,040
<i>We will have to get married, Sunny.</i>

230
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,290
<i>Sunny, think about our love.</i>

231
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:34,080
What happened? Turn on the lights.

232
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,290
What happened?
What happened, Lakshmi?

233
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,450
Why are you shaking?

234
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,580
-Tell me what happened.
-Nothing.

235
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,580
-Nothing happened.
-She is new to this house.

236
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,540
I'll get water for you.

237
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,450
Have some water, dear.

238
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,290
Drink it. You will feel better.

239
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,160
I was her age when I got married.

240
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,330
I've seen enough in this house.

241
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,660
I never screamed so loudly.

242
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,410
Listen, sleep on that side.

243
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,500
And, you, lie down on this side.

244
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,830
-Who's going to turn off the lights?
-You do it.

245
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,660
I am in bed already.

246
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,870
As it is I don't get to sleep
and she's creating a scene.

247
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:54,250
<i>Happy birthday, Brother.
Yesterday's party was so much fun.</i>

248
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:00,080
<i>Brother, I have a confession to make.</i>

249
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,540
<i>I know everything.</i>

250
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,620
<i>What do you mean?</i>

251
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,080
<i>Why did you do this?</i>

252
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,620
<i>Look at me.</i>

253
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,330
<i>You never hit me, Brother.</i>

254
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,080
<i>-But today, you slapped me!
-I wish!</i>

255
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,450
<i>I wish I'd have slapped you earlier.</i>

256
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,410
<i>This wouldn't have happened
had I slapped you earlier.</i>

257
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:14,830
<i>Khurana Industries is the most
famous company in the country.</i>

258
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,790
<i>But your one mistake has ruined us.</i>

259
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,500
<i>Brother, I didn't know this would happen.</i>

260
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,080
<i>You're saying you didn't know?</i>

261
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,790
<i>Patel from the Patel Industries
was our servant earlier.</i>

262
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,290
<i>Today, he's become our boss.</i>

263
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,790
You ruined my life by getting
me married into that family.

264
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,790
You should've at least
enquired about his family.

265
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,450
I don't have peace in that house.

266
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,120
You don't know my struggles.

267
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,910
He only listens to his mother and not me.

268
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,450
I won't go back to that house now.

269
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,290
What happened?

270
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,580
What's wrong?

271
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,000
What happened? Why are you crying?

272
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,950
-Say something. What happened?
-How could he hit me?

273
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,250
Am I an orphan?

274
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,620
How dare he hit me!

275
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,330
He didn't say a word to his mother
and just slapped me.

276
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,040
As if I don't have parents.

277
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,200
I told him

278
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,410
I have a family too...
and I am not a burden for them.

279
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,910
Sunil slapped you?

280
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,290
-But why? What happened?
-His mother.

281
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,120
Old hag!

282
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,290
She calls me infertile!

283
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,330
She keeps taunting me...
for not having kids.

284
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:57,750
She keeps telling me those
who married later have kids

285
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,620
and I am sterile!

286
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:04,120
Look, if I'm a burden to you,
then let me know!

287
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,370
I will take up a job
and take care of myself.

288
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,370
But I am not going back to that house.

289
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,950
Stop being so short tempered.

290
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,080
Listen to what the other one has to say.

291
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,370
This is your house.
You can stay as long as you want.

292
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,790
But you shouldn't fight with your husband.

293
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,910
Women should stay
at their husband's place.

294
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,910
Rupa is right.

295
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,330
That place is like hell
and she won't go back there.

296
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,370
Stop screaming.

297
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,290
First ask her what happened.

298
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,660
Stop arguing with me.

299
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,620
What do I ask her?
Can't you make it out from her face?

300
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,080
She was so healthy when she left.

301
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,660
And now she's become so skinny.

302
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,950
Tell me something.
Who chose Sunil for her?

303
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,580
You did, right?

304
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,540
What did you like about him back then?

305
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,950
Why are you cursing him now?

306
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,700
No need to argue with me.

307
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,700
My daughter is not a liability.

308
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,200
And listen carefully.

309
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:59,000
She won't go back until he finds
a separate house for them.

310
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,000
We're not desperate.
We're Brahmins!

311
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,000
No one can suppress us!

312
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,290
I will make him suffer for this.

313
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,830
Fine. Do as you please.

314
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,660
-Okay?
-Get going.

315
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,790
-Go.
-Yes.

316
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,200
Come, dear.

317
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,830
What are you looking at?
Get some water for her.

318
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,040
Calm down, dear. Don't worry.

319
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,950
I am here. I'll handle everything.

320
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,040
Don't you worry.

321
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,250
Calm down, dear.

322
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,080
<i>Radha! Radha! Radha!</i>

323
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,790
<i>What do you want?
The factory or Radha?</i>

324
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,040
Oh, God. She is such a bitch.

325
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,580
I knew she was going to do that.

326
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,410
<i>You have left me no choice, Shruti.</i>

327
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,330
<i>-I have two ways but...</i>
-Lakshmi, make me a cup of tea.

328
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,410
I have a splitting headache.

329
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:04,040
<i>-Actually...
-I knew it, Prashant.</i>

330
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,500
<i>I knew it.</i>

331
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,870
<i>I won't spare Radha.</i>

332
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,160
What happened?
Are you taking that down?

333
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,370
-Yes, the function is over.
-But why?

334
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,290
Well, the wedding is over now
so I am taking it down.

335
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:25,500
-Let it stay up a few more days.
-No, the function is over.

336
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,370
Give me the keys.

337
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:13,620
Hello, Mr. Groom.
You're back so early.

338
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:18,410
I thought maybe I'll have to send
some men to drag you out of bed.

339
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,790
Here's the key.

340
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,370
And listen...

341
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,000
Take down the pictures of Sonakshi Sinha
from the auto rickshaw.

342
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,040
Do you have any more desires left
now that you're married?

343
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:33,370
Take those pictures down, Shukla,
or else your wife will get angry.

344
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,830
Take it down.

345
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,000
Dr. Shalini has told you
not to eat too many sweets.

346
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,700
Just get some.

347
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,750
Will I have to ask Dr. Shalini
for everything?

348
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,910
Fine, I'll get some.

349
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,450
By the way, when are you returning?

350
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,950
Thursday.

351
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,580
Thursday? Are you sure?

352
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,540
You won't return before that, will you?

353
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,830
You have so many pictures
of Sonakshi Sinha in here?

354
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:09,410
-Is this how you spend your nights?
-Tell us what you do. Come on.

355
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,790
Do you moan, huh?

356
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,370
Motherfucker, when are you
returning my money?

357
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,620
You haven't been answering
my calls for two months now.

358
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,580
Your secretary keeps
telling me that sir is busy.

359
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,200
If you don't have money,
why did you hire a secretary?

360
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,250
Stop. Pull over there.

361
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,040
You can't handle it. Pull over.

362
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,580
I don't want to travel in
your auto rickshaw.

363
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,330
-I am already late.
-Sir, wait, sir.

364
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,870
Sir, you said left, so I took a left turn.

365
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:53,910
I am talking to you, drive slowly.

366
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,870
He's not ready to listen.

367
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,830
I'm a senior citizen.

368
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,370
Do you want to cause an accident?

369
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,540
Is that all you have?

370
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,000
Show your gun to Uncle.

371
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,750
Show it to him.

372
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:28,580
Look.

373
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,080
Look.

374
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,580
Hello, Papa?

375
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,120
Your auto... I like your auto rickshaw.

376
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,700
Your hair is full of lice.

377
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,290
Didn't your mother-in-law
buy shampoo for you?

378
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,200
Your scalp is so dirty.

379
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,870
You haven't even oiled your hair.

380
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,120
Stay put.

381
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,790
Hey. Hello.

382
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,500
It's me.

383
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,200
How are you?

384
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,830
<i>Hello, can you hear me?</i>

385
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,330
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

386
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,700
<i>Answer me.</i>

387
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,000
<i>Okay. Is anybody there around you?</i>

388
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,830
I called you because...

389
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,540
I am embarrassed about
whatever happened last night.

390
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,250
Please forgive me.

391
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,160
<i>You will forgive me, won't you?</i>

392
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,950
<i>Lakshmi, I didn't do it intentionally.</i>

393
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,450
<i>I know nothing about all this.</i>

394
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,580
<i>I don't know how and when...</i>

395
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:11,450
<i>I didn't realize what I was doing.
I'm really embarrassed.</i>

396
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,500
<i>I love you a lot.</i>

397
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:20,080
Anyway, forgive me, please.

398
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,330
You will forgive me, won't you? Hmm?

399
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,160
<i>You will forgive me, won't you?</i>

400
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,330
<i>Okay, listen.</i>

401
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:35,910
<i>Today... when I come home,
please open the door.</i>

402
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,080
<i>Greet me with a beautiful smile.
I will get flowers for you.</i>

403
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,160
<i>Which flowers do you like?</i>

404
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,870
<i>I want you to open the door
when I come back.</i>

405
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,620
<i>-Don't stay around Mom.
-Where are you, Manu?</i>

406
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,790
-<i>Huh?</i>
-What?

407
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,120
Hello, yeah.

408
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,120
I am on my way.

409
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,410
So I thought I should call up
and tell you that I am coming.

410
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,000
Get two pounds of lentils and four pounds
of sugar when you come back.

411
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:05,500
Okay. Is that all,
or do want something else?

412
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,160
Nothing else, just come home soon.

413
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,830
Fine.

414
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,950
She wants me to get lentils and sugar!

415
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,250
He's completely lost it.

416
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:32,750
What happened?

417
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:36,080
What happened, Rupa? Rupa?
Switch on the lights.

418
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,500
What happened, child?

419
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,370
Tell me. What happened?

420
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,950
She's out of breath.

421
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,370
Get a glass of water.

422
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:51,330
-He left me alone once again, Mom.
-Stop crying.

423
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,830
Don't cry. Rupa.

424
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,540
This time when he left me,
I was at the seashore.

425
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,620
Seashore?

426
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,120
Why did you go to the sea?

427
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
Here. Drink some water.

428
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,660
Quiet.

429
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,830
Mom... Mom...

430
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,790
I was walking by the sea.

431
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,330
A big wave came towards me.

432
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,290
I ran to save him.

433
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:28,500
I held his hand really tight.

434
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:34,660
-But he let go of my hand!
-My poor baby! Calm down.

435
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,000
You must be scared.

436
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,910
-You must've had a nightmare.
-I am all alone now, Mom.

437
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,950
-Listen...
-He left me again and went far away.

438
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,290
Open your eyes. Take a look.

439
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,660
Your father, your brother...
we're all here.

440
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:53,200
We won't let any harm come to you.

441
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,040
Calm down.

442
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,450
Shut up!

443
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,830
Stop shouting.

444
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:05,750
-Here, drink some water.
-Mom...

445
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,330
I don't want water.

446
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,830
Switch off the lights.

447
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,870
My poor child!

448
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,500
He's even troubling her in her dreams.

449
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,160
Sunil is a rascal!

450
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,910
I always knew he would do this to her.

451
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,750
Sheila?

452
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,750
We're going to the market.

453
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,700
Lakshmi is all alone at home.
Please look after her.

454
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,700
<i>Sure.</i>

455
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:02,410
Look after her. She is new to
this place and she is alone.

456
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,620
<i>Don't worry, I will be there with her.</i>

457
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:25,330
<i>Buy it for 100 bucks.</i>

458
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,200
You're back so soon?

459
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,500
Your mother asked me
to look after the house.

460
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,370
She said Lakshmi will be alone at home.

461
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:24,250
Yeah, actually Mom called me
and said that I should bring Lakshmi.

462
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,700
It's good you came back.

463
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,620
See, she isn't even talking to me.

464
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,870
She's so shy.

465
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,620
Now that you're back,
she will be really happy.

466
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:39,950
You're very lucky to have
such a beautiful wife.

467
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,250
But why is she so shy?

468
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,950
Bless you. I'll see you.

469
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,950
I will wait downstairs.

470
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:34,120
Sir, I want a room.

471
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,830
We want a room.

472
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,370
For how many hours?

473
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,080
Two or three hours.

474
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,910
And who is she?

475
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,000
She's my wife.

476
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:56,410
Fine, show me your driving license.

477
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,040
Here.

478
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:06,910
That will be 1000 bucks for two hours.

479
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,450
-A thousand bucks?
-Yes.

480
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,160
You must pay the full amount in advance.

481
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:15,500
It's only 700 for the entire day.

482
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,500
And I only want it for two hours.

483
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:20,290
Look, the rates are separate
for an overnight stay.

484
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,250
That's the rent during the day.

485
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,870
Do you want it or not?

486
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:31,790
Here.

487
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,080
Chhote.

488
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,370
Take them to room number 208.

489
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:45,910
Come.

490
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,290
Oh yes.

491
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,950
Okay.

492
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:13,870
Sit.

493
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,290
Sit here, I'll be right back.

494
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:08,370
Sit here, I'll be right back.

495
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:51,700
You...

496
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:54,040
Are you okay?

497
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,910
I mean you aren't getting scared, right?

498
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,250
I brought you here because...

499
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:19,120
I wanted to talk to you.

500
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:22,040
-Okay.
-Yes.

501
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:26,790
We... don't get any
chance to talk at home.

502
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:36,830
I know... you're a genuine woman.

503
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:42,950
But I don't know what you think of me.

504
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:54,040
I promise to keep you happy.

505
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,450
You need not be scared of me or my family.

506
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:11,870
I won't let you suffer... like my sister.

507
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:17,410
Soon... I'll arrange for a house.

508
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:20,000
For the two of us.

509
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,410
I got something for you.

510
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:38,700
You might like it.

511
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,910
Shall I help you wear it?

512
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,040
Does this hurt?

513
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:07,700
Here, keep this.

514
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:23,250
Should I switch on the TV?
Would you like to watch it?

515
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:40,290
<i>Dad, you know,</i>

516
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:44,080
<i>you've always treated me
like a 22-year-old kid.</i>

517
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,330
<i>Even mom...</i>

518
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:47,120
<i>But Nidhi...</i>

519
00:50:58,540 --> 00:50:59,910
Tell me...

520
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,620
<i>If you... accept us...</i>

521
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:07,120
<i>In fact, if you accept the three of us</i>

522
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,660
<i>that will make me happy.</i>

523
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,080
<i>Dad, please...
Please accept us.</i>

524
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:53,330
Where did you get her from?

525
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,620
Sir, she's my wife.

526
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,830
Whose wife is she?

527
00:51:58,910 --> 00:51:59,950
No, sir.

528
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,000
You're wrong. She is my wife.

529
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,330
Tell me, whose wife is she?

530
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:11,790
I am telling the truth. She is my wife.

531
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:14,290
I wanted to talk to her,
so I brought her here.

532
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:18,370
Who pays a thousand bucks
to talk to his wife?

533
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,000
Do you think I'm stupid?

534
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,660
Did you sleep with her or not?

535
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,580
Believe me, she is my wife.

536
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:32,250
Give me her number.

537
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:34,620
-Give me her number.
-I swear, she is my wife.

538
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:35,910
Give me her number.

539
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,910
Sir, I only wanted to talk.

540
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:53,200
-Sir, she's my wife.
-Stop arguing.

541
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:56,330
We're married, sir. Have a look at this.

542
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,330
Here, look. We're married.

543
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:12,290
Motherfucker, was this
the only place you found?

544
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,580
Get lost from here.

545
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:21,700
And you picked this fucking asshole?

546
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,290
What about the others?
They brought their mothers here?

547
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:25,700
Motherfucker!

548
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,000
You wasted my time.

549
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,450
Now sit.

550
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,160
Move.

551
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:58,000
Does my mom know about this?
Let me tell her.

552
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,620
Manu, what are you doing here
sitting at the door?

553
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,910
Nothing, just like that.

554
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:05,450
Should I?

555
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:08,160
Oh, my!

556
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:11,330
When did this happen?
Has Mom seen this?

557
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:12,950
Who is this for? For Manu?

558
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,120
Manu!

559
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:16,450
Mom!

560
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:18,620
Mom, look at Lakshmi.

561
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:23,290
He was waiting for us to go out
and he got Lakshmi all dressed up.

562
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:27,870
Wow! You're looking so beautiful.

563
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,290
And this perfume.

564
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:31,660
She's smelling so nice.

565
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,580
Who bought it for you? Manu?

566
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,250
Manu. You never get anything for me.

567
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:38,700
These bangles are so pretty.

568
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:40,330
Wow.

569
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:43,120
You were waiting for us to leave?

570
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:48,080
I see! Oh!

571
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,290
You're looking so gorgeous.

572
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:11,580
Listen...

573
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:13,330
No. I don't know.

574
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:15,700
Tomorrow I am busy.

575
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:17,410
You can come the day after.

576
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,580
Fine, come over.

577
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:40,790
No, I am not scared of my boyfriend, okay.

578
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,250
You know that.

579
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:51,870
Take a left turn from here.

580
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:02,080
This one's broken as well.

581
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,200
Here.

582
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,120
I don't have change.

583
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:10,790
What do you mean you don't have change?

584
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:13,250
It's your job to carry change.
You have to.

585
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:14,290
You're right, ma'am.

586
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:16,700
But I just started
and you're my first customer.

587
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:18,450
I don't get it.

588
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,330
Do you want me to keep
traveling up and down for you?

589
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:21,700
Or produce change from thin air?

590
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,080
Don't get angry, ma'am.
I really don't have change.

591
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,410
Who's getting angry?

592
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:28,790
It's your job to give change.
Don't try to teach me.

593
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:32,080
Ma'am, believe me.
I don't have change today.

594
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,250
-So you don't have change today.
-Yes.

595
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:34,160
-You don't, do you?
-Yes.

596
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:35,660
Then don't take money at all.

597
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,250
Stay here.

598
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,540
Ma'am, listen...

599
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:42,120
I'll get change for you.

600
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:44,080
How dare you touch me?

601
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:46,750
I know your intentions.

602
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,700
-Ma'am, I was saying I'll get change.
-You'll get change?

603
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:51,200
-From where? The tree?
-No.

604
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:54,080
-There are shops here, I'll ask...
-Why didn't you say that before?

605
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,620
Why were you pretending before?

606
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,500
Uncle, he's following me for the money.

607
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,580
-What's going on?
-Nothing, sir, I just...

608
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,830
He's trying to misbehave with me.

609
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:07,040
He was constantly starting at me
in the mirror.

610
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:09,120
-Was looking at me.
-Is this how you behave with girls?

611
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:10,910
-Now get out of here.
-Sir...

612
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,160
-How dare you come into this society area
-Madam, why...

613
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:15,200
-in the first place?
-Uncle, get him out.

614
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:17,250
Get out. Get out of here.

615
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:18,160
Get out of here.

616
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:19,580
-What took you so long?
-Get out of here.

617
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:22,540
Now go get back in your auto rickshaw.

618
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:30,660
Come on.

619
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:33,290
Because of people like him,
we can't go out.

620
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:36,200
Get out of the society.

621
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:38,750
You start drooling
every time you see a lonely girl.

622
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:40,410
We can't step out of our houses
because of them.

623
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,200
Are they ruling the country?

624
01:01:57,830 --> 01:02:00,000
Look, see how fresh these vegetables are.

625
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,830
Touch them.

626
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:05,330
Yeah. Next time, feel them before you buy.

627
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:07,410
What is this? Don't just take anything.

628
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,660
When will you learn?

629
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:12,250
You've learned nothing all these years.

630
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:14,040
-Do you have peas?
-Yes, I do.

631
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:16,410
Lakshmi, buy some fresh peas.

632
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,450
Manu loves <i>Matar Paneer</i>.

633
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:21,580
Don't forget to ask
about the things he likes to eat.

634
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,910
I'll go get some bananas.

635
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:32,040
So tell me. How are you
getting along with Manu?

636
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:35,160
It's good.

637
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:38,370
You're lucky to have a husband like Manu.

638
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,160
He loves you so much.

639
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:42,660
He's giving you time
to get along with the family.

640
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:46,080
Is he saving time for other things too?

641
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,700
Wow! How nice!

642
01:02:56,290 --> 01:02:59,700
You know, my husband
wouldn't let go of me.

643
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:02,370
It was like he would get possessed.

644
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:04,250
He would keep doing it day and night.

645
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:06,660
Those were the days!

646
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:10,000
And sometimes he would
start doing it in the kitchen.

647
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:12,040
I would be cooking in the kitchen

648
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,910
and he would creep up from behind and...

649
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,580
Just imagine. How is my brother?

650
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:23,040
Has he done anything yet?

651
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:26,750
What?

652
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:28,620
Nothing?

653
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:37,330
If it was my husband he wouldn't
have left me alone even for a moment.

654
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:40,290
He's never embarrassed
doing anything in front of everyone.

655
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:42,000
My husband is like an animal.

656
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,500
-How much do I need to pay?
-Thirty rupees.

657
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:48,660
Imagine what it was like.

658
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:51,540
Keeps doing it day in and day out.

659
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,660
Here, take this.

660
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:03,330
I couldn't even sleep properly
for a month after my wedding.

661
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:09,250
What is this?

662
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:12,700
I asked you to check the vegetables
before buying.

663
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:17,290
Pick them up and take a look
and you will notice the difference.

664
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:20,410
See, this one's so soft.

665
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:23,580
-You shouldn't buy these.
-Show me.

666
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:27,160
These are too soft.

667
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:29,410
You shouldn't even touch these.

668
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:36,750
I think the ones that are a little
hard are much better.

669
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:38,080
Am I right, Mom?

670
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:41,000
Look at this one. It's perfect.

671
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:46,250
Yes, this one's right.

672
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:48,870
It's pretty rare to find one like this.

673
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:51,750
Take it, take it.

674
01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:43,040
I am God.

675
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:45,200
Which God?

676
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,410
The God of Sex.

677
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:53,370
Okay, the God of Sex.

678
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,450
Come down and get your ass in the chair.

679
01:05:58,250 --> 01:05:59,750
My foot!

680
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:02,750
You're more like Shikhandi. Shikhandi!

681
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,700
I am not Shikhandi.

682
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:21,790
What is this?

683
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:25,580
Why is your sister
always there in your house?

684
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:27,580
I don't know, man.

685
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:32,910
My life's completely fucked.

686
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:38,790
Rascals... You guys...

687
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:44,450
lectured me on sex before I got married.

688
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:51,200
But you never mentioned anything about
problems that come after the wedding.

689
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:54,250
We were only having fun.

690
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,910
We're all facing the same problems.

691
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,370
Except for him.

692
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:04,290
Because he has only one motto.

693
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,870
Always be self-sufficient.

694
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,200
You're better off.

695
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:20,040
You have no issues when it comes
to women or space.

696
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:21,660
Just keep at it.

697
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:26,830
But what are your parents doing?

698
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:31,000
My parents are doing
what parents normally do.

699
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:36,660
I mean...

700
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:38,500
my mother...

701
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:42,660
is always either cursing Rupa's in-laws...

702
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:45,700
or watching TV.

703
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:48,290
That's what she enjoys.

704
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:51,410
-And your father?
-My father...

705
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:54,830
I salute my father.

706
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:56,040
Yes.

707
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:01,790
He's made up a wall of suitcases
in the room for me.

708
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:07,250
And suggested I should go for it.

709
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:12,660
But tell me, how can I do it?

710
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:17,200
That's the problem.

711
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:22,500
Look, Shukla, the reality is,
that you must buy a separate house.

712
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:25,330
Say something new.

713
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:27,950
Even I know this. You keep saying
the same thing over and over again.

714
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:29,790
Shall I say something, Shukla?

715
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:32,410
I hope you don't feel offended.

716
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,120
Say...

717
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,580
You don't have courage.

718
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:39,910
What do you mean?

719
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:47,450
You don't have the courage
to take your decisions.

720
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:51,160
You're responsible for your own problems.

721
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:53,040
And no one else.

722
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:56,330
First figure that out
and then complain here.

723
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:04,910
I'll show you what I can do.

724
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,160
You're leaving.

725
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:15,000
Are you really going?

726
01:09:16,330 --> 01:09:18,120
Yes, I am.

727
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,620
I'll show you what I can do.

728
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:25,790
-Shall I drop you?
-No.

729
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:31,540
Listen, your house is in that direction.

730
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:33,620
I know.

731
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,370
Then go that way.

732
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,330
"I know."

733
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,410
<i>Dear animal, Lord Shiva is not here
at this moment!</i>

734
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:26,450
<i>He has gone for a dance.</i>

735
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:31,950
<i>But I can get you to meet Menaka.</i>

736
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,580
<i>Lord Narada.</i>

737
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:42,370
<i>Please arrange a meeting with her then.</i>

738
01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:44,950
<i>I will be grateful...</i>

739
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,830
What?

740
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:02,540
Are you drunk?

741
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:05,040
Yes, I am drunk.

742
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:07,620
I will drink every day.

743
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:11,790
And if you don't open the door,
I will break it open.

744
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:14,040
What will you do?

745
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:17,830
This is all I have left
to see in my last days.

746
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,160
Yes, I will do whatever I want.

747
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,790
What did you drink?

748
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:25,250
You can't even differentiate
between right and wrong.

749
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,870
You should've thought about your wife.

750
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:33,330
She's been trying to call you
since morning.

751
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:36,080
-You should've answered her calls.
-Who called me?

752
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,160
No one called me.

753
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:41,040
Lakshmi, get some food for him.

754
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:44,000
Hey, keep quiet.

755
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:48,580
She wants to feed me!

756
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:51,370
Go and feed your husband!

757
01:11:53,870 --> 01:11:55,290
She's trying to push us around.

758
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:58,040
How dare you talk to her like that!

759
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:01,620
Get some water.

760
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:03,410
Hey...

761
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:05,330
What are you asking her to do?

762
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:06,620
What?

763
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,660
She is my wife.
She's not your servant.

764
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:12,660
You go and get water for me.

765
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,580
-Me?
-Yes, you.

766
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,370
Go and get it.

767
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:23,750
You can't do it for your husband,
not for me, not even for yourself.

768
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,660
You can't do it for anyone.

769
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:30,410
What are you doing here?

770
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,290
Go back to your own house.

771
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:39,790
And it's not a big thing
if they are contemplating divorce.

772
01:12:39,870 --> 01:12:41,200
Shut your mouth, Manu!

773
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:45,080
Is this the way to talk to her?
Enough of this!

774
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:54,660
Yes, I will.

775
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:02,790
Here, have some water.

776
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,750
See... he's acting like this with you now.

777
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:25,000
Why don't you ever say anything?

778
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:26,830
Or will I have to deal with this
all the time?

779
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:30,000
Look. He's so drunk!

780
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:35,540
Go, Lakshmi, get some food
for him and put him to sleep

781
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:37,330
so he gets a little sober!

782
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:40,290
Lakshmi won't go anywhere.

783
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,040
I will go myself.

784
01:13:56,910 --> 01:13:59,160
All auspiciousness to Lord Vishnu.

785
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:01,950
All auspiciousness to One
Who has Garuda as His flag.

786
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:05,080
All auspiciousness to One
Who has eyes like the lotus.

787
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:07,500
And auspiciousness to Hari.

788
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:13,910
Hey...

789
01:17:26,870 --> 01:17:28,620
<i>Rupa, trust me.</i>

790
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:30,410
That's what you always say.

791
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:32,580
<i>Believe me, Rupa. I am trying.</i>

792
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:36,200
-You said the same thing before.
<i>-Please listen to me first.</i>

793
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:37,370
But what happened?

794
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,620
If you've made up your mind
on getting divorced...

795
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:44,370
<i>-No, Rupa.</i>
-...then it's fine.

796
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:49,370
-Is that right?
-<i>I'm really trying. Trust me.</i>

797
01:17:50,330 --> 01:17:52,040
If that's the case,
then I won't bother you again.

798
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:53,660
<i>That's not true, Rupa.</i>

799
01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:57,250
Then why don't you do something?

800
01:17:57,450 --> 01:17:58,660
<i>I'm trying.</i>

801
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,200
-My demands are not only for me.
<i>-I know that.</i>

802
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:05,870
-It's for both of us.
<i>-I understand. I really do.</i>

803
01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:08,120
<i>I'm talking to my mother too.</i>

804
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:11,450
<i>Please try to understand.
It's not that easy.</i>

805
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:13,950
I have to go now.

806
01:18:15,950 --> 01:18:17,370
I'll talk to you later.

807
01:18:20,290 --> 01:18:21,660
Who were you talking to?

808
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:23,950
Sunil?

809
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,500
You were talking to Sunil, weren't you?

810
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,410
Yes, I was talking to Sunil.

811
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:33,790
What is your problem?

812
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:36,660
Will I have to take your permission now?

813
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:39,580
Do I have to ask you first
before taking any decision?

814
01:18:39,660 --> 01:18:40,700
Do I?

815
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:42,620
No.

816
01:18:42,790 --> 01:18:44,080
Then what are you doing here?

817
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:48,370
Do you know what you
said to me last night?

818
01:18:50,330 --> 01:18:51,580
What? What did I say?

819
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,160
What did I say? Did I say something?

820
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:59,870
You spoke your mind.

821
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:04,250
You spilled all the filth
that's inside you.

822
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,080
Hey, that...

823
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:10,910
I was drunk... I got really high.
I don't know what I said.

824
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,410
Please don't mind.

825
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:20,660
Last night, you clearly told us
what you want.

826
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,410
And we've understood everything.

827
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,700
What did I say?

828
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:30,160
Do you know that his mother
calls me a barren woman?

829
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:32,620
She insults me all the time.

830
01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:35,540
Sunil is running the entire household.

831
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:37,370
No one wants to lift a finger to help.

832
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,370
And that's why even Sunil
thinks about separating.

833
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:45,200
-And his brother, Raju?...
-What can he do?

834
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:50,410
Either he's doing nothing in the house
or going out with his friends.

835
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:53,830
He doesn't do anything
because his brother is earning.

836
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:57,620
But I remember he was doing something.

837
01:19:57,790 --> 01:19:59,200
He quit it long ago.

838
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:06,120
He says he won't take up a job
and only fools work.

839
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:08,410
He wants to start his own business.

840
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,330
It's been two years,
but he hasn't done anything yet.

841
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:12,540
If you ask him, the only thing
he ever says is "My wish."

842
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:15,700
-Then?
-Then what?

843
01:20:17,370 --> 01:20:19,450
Sunil opened a shop for him.

844
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:25,580
But how can he run a shop when
he wakes up at 12 in the afternoon?

845
01:20:26,410 --> 01:20:28,120
It closed down after a month.

846
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:32,080
And didn't you talk to Sunil about this?

847
01:20:32,450 --> 01:20:35,790
Whenever I talk to him, he gets sad.

848
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:41,120
He wonders what will
happen to his parents.

849
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:44,040
And it's not his fault either.

850
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:47,000
But you tell me, what do I do?

851
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:54,620
Does one man have to run
the entire household?

852
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:58,580
Now you too are married.

853
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:00,370
You will have kids too.

854
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:03,370
Will you be able to run the household
in such a condition?

855
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:07,790
Last night you were
teaching us your wisdom.

856
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:10,120
So tell me, what do I do?

857
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:17,580
You didn't talk to him about kids.

858
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:19,950
We hardly get to talk in that house.

859
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:26,830
If I try to talk to him, all he says is,
"Don't make a scene.

860
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,660
Soon everything will be fine."

861
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:37,290
But you must talk to him
clearly about this.

862
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:38,950
You think I didn't talk to him?

863
01:21:40,370 --> 01:21:42,410
I am tired of talking to him about this.

864
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:46,370
And this time when I tried talking to him,
he slapped me instead.

865
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:42,910
<i>Narayan, Narayan</i>

866
01:23:43,290 --> 01:23:46,500
<i>Goddess, this seems to be complicated.</i>

867
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:51,790
<i>He wanted to meet you.</i>

868
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,950
<i>So I brought him here.</i>

869
01:23:56,660 --> 01:23:59,580
<i>So tell me. What do you want?</i>

870
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:10,870
How are you, Rupa?

871
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,160
Come, Rupa, let's go back home.

872
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:21,660
I know you've been through a lot
and I couldn't do anything to help you.

873
01:24:22,450 --> 01:24:25,450
But believe me,
this time I'm being honest.

874
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:27,620
I will fix everything this time.

875
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,080
I see...

876
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:36,370
These sweet words aren't enough.

877
01:24:36,450 --> 01:24:40,330
If you were so concerned about Rupa,
then why didn't you buy another house?

878
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:42,830
Tell me? Can you leave your mother?

879
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:45,790
-Can you buy a separate house?
-I will talk to my mother.

880
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,370
She will agree.

881
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,870
Just give me some time.

882
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:51,330
Believe me.

883
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:53,410
Will your mother agree?

884
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:56,620
She insults her all the time.

885
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:59,330
But she never considers the fact

886
01:24:59,410 --> 01:25:03,290
that my daughter works
all day like a slave.

887
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:05,830
She works over a hot stove
to feed all of you.

888
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:09,250
I gave you my daughter, not a servant.

889
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:11,700
I wholeheartedly apologize to you.

890
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,500
I cannot change what happened.

891
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:20,200
But I promise it will never happen again.

892
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:24,370
Please believe me.

893
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,330
You want me to believe you?

894
01:25:26,450 --> 01:25:28,830
Aren't you getting married again?

895
01:25:28,910 --> 01:25:30,950
Isn't your family already trying
to find you another wife?

896
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,080
Isn't that true? Say that it's not true.

897
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:35,290
Rupa, don't believe these rumors.

898
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:38,080
You know how much I love you.

899
01:25:39,410 --> 01:25:42,080
Why would I have come here
had I not loved you?

900
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:46,250
Every person here has an opinion about me.

901
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:49,040
Don't talk to her. Talk to me.

902
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,410
I don't believe you.

903
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:53,870
This is exactly what you say every time.

904
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:56,080
You say the same things
over and over again.

905
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,080
You want me to believe you?

906
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:01,330
You're the same person who hits his wife
on his mother's demands.

907
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:06,040
I know I made a mistake.
I slapped you.

908
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:09,120
And it was the biggest mistake of my life.

909
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:12,370
But Rupa, I have realized something.

910
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:15,370
Your happiness is the most
important thing for me.

911
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:20,750
I don't care what anyone thinks about me.

912
01:26:21,870 --> 01:26:24,660
But... please don't misunderstand me.

913
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:27,160
Have faith in me.

914
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:30,080
Go and say this to someone else.

915
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:34,790
My daughter and I know you
and your mother very well.

916
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:36,410
Now, go. We've had enough of this.

917
01:26:36,540 --> 01:26:37,450
Get out.

918
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:39,950
What is your problem now?

919
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:44,080
He's admitting his mistake,
so what is your problem?

920
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:48,080
He is here to apologize for his mistake.

921
01:26:48,450 --> 01:26:51,700
He knew you all of you will curse him
but he still came here.

922
01:26:53,790 --> 01:26:56,410
That's the kind of husband
every parent wants for their daughter.

923
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,500
I mean, he's standing here
at your doorstep and apologizing

924
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:00,870
and you're taunting him!

925
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:04,080
"Your mother tortures Rupa!"

926
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:07,790
Look at yourself!
Look at how you're treating him.

927
01:27:10,870 --> 01:27:12,540
The truth is always bitter.

928
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:16,540
I know all of you speak the truth
but I am the one at the receiving end.

929
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:18,250
I am a mother after all.

930
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:22,540
Is it wrong to love my children,
to think about their best interests?

931
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:25,540
Won't you think about your child
when you have one?

932
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:27,080
What do you think?

933
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:29,290
You think they cannot live without you?

934
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:32,000
Rupa is not a child anymore.

935
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:35,660
She can make her own decisions.

936
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:40,040
I know you raised her but now you
must let her decide like an adult.

937
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:43,040
I raised you too.

938
01:27:43,290 --> 01:27:46,290
But look at how you're talking to me.

939
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:49,200
It feels like you're not my son

940
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:53,120
but one of those people
on the street talking to me.

941
01:27:53,790 --> 01:27:56,250
You can only see what
Rupa is going through

942
01:27:56,330 --> 01:27:57,250
but you don't understand my side.

943
01:27:57,330 --> 01:27:59,790
Look at how he's talking to me!

944
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:03,000
As if he raised Rupa and not me.

945
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:05,080
Have you ever been to your sister's house?

946
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:07,290
Have you ever seen
how these people treat her?

947
01:28:07,370 --> 01:28:09,290
"They treat her like this,
they treat her like that."

948
01:28:09,370 --> 01:28:10,700
That's what you always say.

949
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:15,330
Have you ever noticed
how you treat others?

950
01:28:17,330 --> 01:28:19,540
Look at how you treat Lakshmi.

951
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:22,830
She's from another family too.

952
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:26,790
Have you ever talked to her nicely
ever she came here?

953
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:29,000
Did you ever talk to her lovingly?

954
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:32,080
Did you give her any respect?

955
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:36,870
You keep asking her to serve you
all the time.

956
01:28:37,910 --> 01:28:40,120
Is this what she came here for?

957
01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:45,910
You know what a marriage is all about?

958
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,540
Building a wall of suitcases
doesn't fix things.

959
01:28:50,830 --> 01:28:54,700
I wonder what I did to deserve you.

960
01:28:55,450 --> 01:28:57,120
You're no longer my son!

961
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:00,290
Lakshmi, you're my daughter now.

962
01:29:02,790 --> 01:29:06,870
Thank God, at least you
called her your daughter.

963
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:13,660
And him...

964
01:29:14,830 --> 01:29:16,120
He's the eldest member of the family.

965
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:21,370
Let alone deciding right and wrong,
he doesn't have the right to say a word.

966
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:27,540
Is he only good for watching
those stupid daily soaps with you?

967
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:32,830
You take all the decisions in this house.

968
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:36,500
Did you ever let anyone else speak?

969
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:37,910
Or express themselves?

970
01:29:39,370 --> 01:29:42,660
All of us live like strangers here.

971
01:29:44,950 --> 01:29:48,040
We can definitely live peacefully here.

972
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:51,370
Have you ever thought about that?

973
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:02,500
You are my son.

974
01:30:03,450 --> 01:30:05,620
How could you humiliate me like that?

975
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:11,330
I've been through so many hardships
while raising both of you.

976
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:15,790
And this is what I get in return.

977
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:19,580
My children are humiliating me.

978
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:32,580
I am not humiliating anyone.

979
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:36,040
I just want everyone to be happy.

980
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:39,330
We should live happily here and they
should be happy in their house.

981
01:30:40,830 --> 01:30:42,250
It's their life.

982
01:30:42,330 --> 01:30:43,790
Let them live it on their own terms.

983
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,580
We shouldn't interfere in their life.

984
01:31:04,790 --> 01:31:05,830
Mom.

985
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:09,290
Please don't mind whatever I said.

986
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:13,540
I didn't say it to hurt you.

987
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:19,120
I only said it to clear the
air in this house.

988
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:23,290
Mom...

989
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:26,500
no one wants to prove you wrong.

990
01:31:28,450 --> 01:31:29,910
We love you.

991
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,410
And I'm sorry for what I said.

992
01:31:38,830 --> 01:31:42,330
Even I can sit with you
and watch the daily soap.

993
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:46,580
But what's the point
in living that kind of life?

994
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:51,250
We should all sit together
and talk freely.

995
01:31:52,330 --> 01:31:56,660
We should know
what we think about each other.

996
01:31:57,790 --> 01:32:00,290
That's how we'll know each other.

997
01:32:08,410 --> 01:32:09,500
Fine.

998
01:32:11,370 --> 01:32:12,950
If you think you're right...

999
01:32:13,830 --> 01:32:15,830
then there's no point of talking anymore.

1000
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:21,200
As far as I am concerned,
I am leaving this house.

1001
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:47,000
Mom...

1002
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:49,950
I am going back home.

1003
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:54,450
And I think this is the right thing to do.

1004
01:34:13,950 --> 01:34:15,370
Stop. Stop!

1005
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:18,040
We want to go to Borivali.

1006
01:34:18,370 --> 01:34:21,450
-No, I won't go that way.
-It's an emergency.

1007
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:23,540
He has very high fever.

1008
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:25,040
Please, please. Take us there.

1009
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:28,080
No. Look for another auto rickshaw.
I must go now.

1010
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:30,080
Please, he has a fever.
His body is burning.

1011
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:32,290
Please, let's go. He will die. Please.

1012
01:34:32,370 --> 01:34:34,790
Get in. I beg of you.

1013
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:36,750
-Okay, let's go.
-Thank you.

1014
01:34:51,410 --> 01:34:54,250
I told you not to take him to that doctor.

1015
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:55,790
Look at what happened now.

1016
01:34:56,750 --> 01:35:00,160
I thought it's a regular fever.

1017
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:02,200
But his fever hasn't subsided.

1018
01:35:02,290 --> 01:35:04,250
Regular fever?

1019
01:35:04,330 --> 01:35:05,870
Then why did he suggest so many tests?

1020
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:09,040
Blood test. Urine test.
All the doctors are looting us.

1021
01:35:09,950 --> 01:35:12,120
They have turned this profession
into a business.

1022
01:35:12,330 --> 01:35:13,620
-What?
-Yes.

1023
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:17,500
They fleece patient with
complicated names.

1024
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,160
People consider them Gods.
They should be beaten.

1025
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:23,870
-Take a left turn from ahead.
-Yes.

1026
01:35:25,790 --> 01:35:29,040
His fees was the lowest.
I thought he would get better.

1027
01:35:29,370 --> 01:35:32,450
We always have these problems.

1028
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:34,040
Cheap.

1029
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:37,370
Remember, you gave 100,000 to
Zahir Sheikh to go to Dubai.

1030
01:35:37,450 --> 01:35:39,000
You thought his fees was the lowest.

1031
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:42,540
He disappeared with our money. Idiot!

1032
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:47,160
Hey, why do you always attack me? Why?

1033
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:49,700
What did you do?
You were with me too. Weren't you?

1034
01:35:49,790 --> 01:35:51,370
You should've advised me against it.

1035
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:54,330
Now if you argue with me
I will thrash you.

1036
01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:55,870
-You will beat me?
-Yes.

1037
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:57,540
You think you can beat me?

1038
01:35:57,830 --> 01:35:59,870
I will beat you, I am warning you.

1039
01:36:00,450 --> 01:36:03,370
-Mister, take a left turn.
-No, no, take a right turn.

1040
01:36:03,450 --> 01:36:04,700
There's a shortcut from the right.

1041
01:36:04,790 --> 01:36:07,450
Do you know the way? You've
been making me go right, left...

1042
01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:09,700
-It's right.
-Just keep going, keep going.

1043
01:36:09,790 --> 01:36:11,790
-We know the way.
-Take a left turn.

1044
01:36:11,870 --> 01:36:12,950
It's a shortcut. Right

1045
01:36:15,450 --> 01:36:16,660
Pull over here.

1046
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:18,830
Pull over on the right.

1047
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:22,290
Stop. Stop.

1048
01:36:22,910 --> 01:36:23,830
Get out.

1049
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:25,120
Get out.

1050
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,950
-Get out.
-What happened?

1051
01:36:27,330 --> 01:36:30,330
Get out. Come on.

1052
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:31,910
Come on.

1053
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:34,290
-What happened, sir?
-Give me your cash. Your money.

1054
01:36:34,370 --> 01:36:37,250
Don't fall down. Stand up.
He loves beating people.

1055
01:36:37,450 --> 01:36:38,950
Stand straight. Stand up.

1056
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,910
Give us the money.
He gets really violent.

1057
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:44,700
Slap him.

1058
01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:47,250
-Hurry up, he's a violent man.
-What is this?

1059
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:51,790
-I have no more money.
-What?

1060
01:36:51,870 --> 01:36:53,790
He's broke.

1061
01:36:53,870 --> 01:36:55,870
Money. Give us the money.

1062
01:36:58,450 --> 01:37:00,200
Please, sir, no.

1063
01:37:01,450 --> 01:37:02,700
No...

1064
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:05,410
I'll break your bones.

1065
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:13,580
No, sir. Believe me, I don't have money.

1066
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:15,500
Sir...

1067
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:18,750
I am telling the truth. You can check.

1068
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,830
I don't have any more cash.

1069
01:37:24,410 --> 01:37:26,410
-Please spare me.
-Listen.

1070
01:37:27,370 --> 01:37:28,450
Get lost.

1071
01:37:30,450 --> 01:37:32,910
Yeah, that's right.

1072
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,540
-Now he will give us the cash.
-No, sir.

1073
01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:36,120
Sir...

1074
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:40,580
Take it. Hit him. Hit him.

1075
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:44,250
-No, sir.
-Give us the money.

1076
01:37:44,330 --> 01:37:46,580
Hit him. Hit him hard.

1077
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:49,540
Take this!

1078
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:51,700
Give us the money!

1079
01:37:52,290 --> 01:37:54,120
Spare me...

1080
01:37:57,700 --> 01:37:59,870
Stop. Take off the ring.

1081
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:03,000
Take it off.

1082
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:05,950
Don't let go of his hand.

1083
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:08,250
Take it off.

1084
01:38:08,950 --> 01:38:10,290
Give it to me.

1085
01:38:12,830 --> 01:38:17,370
-Loosen your hand.
-Pull, pull...

1086
01:38:17,950 --> 01:38:19,750
-Pull it off!
-Come on.

1087
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:24,700
It's too tight.

1088
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:30,870
-No, sir.
-Cut it.

1089
01:38:30,950 --> 01:38:32,500
-Cut it.
-No, sir.

1090
01:38:33,830 --> 01:38:36,290
Chop it off. Come on!

1091
01:38:36,370 --> 01:38:39,290
-Cut it off!
-Come on.

1092
01:38:53,620 --> 01:38:54,870
What...

1093
01:39:44,910 --> 01:39:46,040
Why are you crying?

1094
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:50,580
No...

1095
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:53,750
It's nothing.

1096
01:39:56,660 --> 01:39:57,830
Why are you crying?

1097
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:04,000
It's nothing.

1098
01:40:06,830 --> 01:40:08,000
Everything is all right.

1099
01:40:09,330 --> 01:40:10,620
You're crying.

1100
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:15,120
No.

1101
01:40:18,790 --> 01:40:21,080
You don't know how to lie, so stop lying.

1102
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:38,040
I don't know anything about you.

1103
01:40:43,290 --> 01:40:44,660
Then find out.

1104
01:40:59,330 --> 01:41:01,790
I saw the pencils and the book.

1105
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:04,120
When?

1106
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:09,120
The other day, at the hotel.

1107
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:19,330
How do you know that I like to draw?

1108
01:41:22,330 --> 01:41:23,660
I knew it.

1109
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:33,500
You're hurt so badly on your face

1110
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,830
and you're still smiling.

1111
01:41:37,580 --> 01:41:40,160
No matter how awful I look,

1112
01:41:40,660 --> 01:41:42,330
I was always handsome...

1113
01:41:43,250 --> 01:41:44,750
and I will continue being
handsome for you.

1114
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:14,700
Shall I say something?

1115
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:17,620
Yes, please.

1116
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:23,200
This place is stinking, isn't it?

1117
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:27,330
Yes. Why didn't you tell me this before?

1118
01:44:27,910 --> 01:44:30,500
I thought you'll feel offended.

1119
01:44:31,450 --> 01:44:34,830
No, I won't feel offended. Tell me.

1120
01:44:40,910 --> 01:44:43,000
Shall I say another thing?

1121
01:44:44,290 --> 01:44:45,250
What?

1122
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:48,540
Am I stinking too?

1123
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:50,250
No.

1124
01:44:52,660 --> 01:44:53,790
You're too much.

1125
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:59,540
This shirt looks really nice on you.

1126
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:14,700
You know what?

1127
01:45:16,370 --> 01:45:19,870
My mother made the right decision
by choosing you for me.

1128
01:45:21,950 --> 01:45:22,910
Why?

1129
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:25,540
It's nothing.

1130
01:45:30,750 --> 01:45:31,660
You know what?

1131
01:45:32,950 --> 01:45:35,870
I removed all the pictures of Sonakshi
Sinha from my auto rickshaw.

1132
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:40,700
You don't like Sonakshi anymore?

1133
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:43,000
No.

1134
01:45:45,450 --> 01:45:48,750
-Shall I tell you something?
-No, nothing else, please.

1135
01:45:51,870 --> 01:45:55,120
Go on. I was kidding.

1136
01:45:56,700 --> 01:45:59,910
I don't like Sonakshi Sinha.

1137
01:46:00,330 --> 01:46:01,290
Why?

1138
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:06,790
I only like Akshay Kumar.

1139
01:46:06,910 --> 01:46:07,950
I see.

1140
01:46:08,700 --> 01:46:10,830
So now I'll have to become Akshay Kumar?

1141
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:19,580
-Will I have to become Akshay Kumar?
-No.

1142
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:30,830
Before the wedding,
my friends really scared me.

1143
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:33,290
They would tell me stories

1144
01:46:33,620 --> 01:46:36,160
about how husbands and mothers-in-law are

1145
01:46:36,250 --> 01:46:37,910
and how I'd be treated
at my in-law's place.

1146
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:39,040
Meaning?

1147
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:44,160
I don't know, but... they are all mad.

1148
01:46:44,580 --> 01:46:46,700
What about your friends?

1149
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:49,580
They are all crazy.

1150
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,330
Mine too. All my friends are crazy.

1151
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:57,660
You know what happened
with one of my friends?

1152
01:46:57,750 --> 01:47:00,250
-What?
-After she got married

1153
01:47:00,370 --> 01:47:04,540
her husband would
bring her soap every day.

1154
01:47:05,910 --> 01:47:09,200
Maybe her husband thought
it's for fragrance.

1155
01:47:09,290 --> 01:47:14,750
And she is so strange.
She never asked why he did so?

1156
01:47:14,830 --> 01:47:18,500
People are crazy. They do stupid things.

1157
01:47:18,830 --> 01:47:23,040
Yeah, such crazy people exist.

1158
01:47:31,410 --> 01:47:33,500
Shall I tell you something more?

1159
01:47:33,950 --> 01:47:35,080
What?

1160
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:42,330
I like... talking to you.

1161
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:46,450
Me too.
