173
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:55,950
I've called you at this time because..

174
00:18:56,324 --> 00:18:58,632
..we're facing an imminent threat!

175
00:18:59,081 --> 00:19:01,573
Abbas, Could you please brief the council!

176
00:19:01,812 --> 00:19:06,519
As you know, our special team has
carried out a successful operation

177
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:09,632
During this operation, 6 terrorists
have been killed

178
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:11,242
Miss Javeria,

179
00:19:11,772 --> 00:19:14,359
The team also killed this man!
Sanjay Bhardwaj

180
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:18,149
A first contact, low level, RAW Operative!

181
00:19:18,218 --> 00:19:23,316
Sanjay ran a rice export business as a front!
From Middle East, Europe and Central Asia

182
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,936
Eversince his disappearance,
he was nowhere to be found...

183
00:19:26,213 --> 00:19:30,543
-Untill now.
-Our sources tell us that huge amount of money
is backing these operations

184
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:34,407
Which means, we being out-funded by these organizations

185
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,345
-Uhh, but never out-gunned! Sir!

186
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:45,046
Chatter from cross border and our sources indicate
that a high level independant contractor has been hired...

187
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:49,341
To carry out one of the biggest terrorist attack
in the history of Pakistan.

188
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:54,694
If our info is correct, this attack would make
Marriot Bombing look like picnic!!

189
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:04,746
We also believe that this independent contractor
may try to cross the border in day or two..

190
00:20:05,783 --> 00:20:08,831
We've also prepared a shortlist of potentials...

191
00:20:09,811 --> 00:20:14,902
This man, Habib Afghani AKA Abu Hamza
AKA Ramal..

192
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:17,881
A Serial-Killer-Turned Terrorist for hire..

193
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,356
Expert in Weapons & Strategy,
Hand-to-hand Combat..

194
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:36,054
He's known to get in-&-out of
any country he wants...

195
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:41,207
Basically, A first-class-Super-Operative
-Well, with the number of people crossing the border

196
00:20:41,553 --> 00:20:44,153
its like looking for a 
needle in a haystack.

197
00:20:44,163 --> 00:20:48,231
-Its probably of no use now, because 
operative like that wants to enter a country

198
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:50,065
-He is coming...

199
00:21:11,209 --> 00:21:12,923
Sir, We know what we are up against...

200
00:21:12,993 --> 00:21:16,967
I'll have my team will come up with a strategy..
<i>We will Stop this terrorist...</i>

201
00:21:47,312 --> 00:21:48,312
Pull Over..

202
00:25:02,161 --> 00:25:07,028
When you are so close to your goals...
for which you've consumed your life...

203
00:25:09,145 --> 00:25:11,718
You start to wonder, What's next?

204
00:25:15,423 --> 00:25:17,245
<i>[Whispering]
You know what's next..!</i>

205
00:25:21,474 --> 00:25:25,161
Don't you ever feel...
that what we do here...

206
00:25:25,374 --> 00:25:26,924
.. is wrong..

207
00:25:27,263 --> 00:25:29,370
We're match made in heaven..

208
00:25:29,624 --> 00:25:31,173
Don't you think..?

209
00:25:31,862 --> 00:25:34,283
I've something so important to focus on...

210
00:25:34,972 --> 00:25:39,021
I managed to get everyone on the table..
I'm this close to get the dam built..

211
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:43,323
Zoya

212
00:25:45,552 --> 00:25:47,276
I've come to say you "Good-Bye"

213
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,287
You know what I think..?

214
00:26:04,092 --> 00:26:05,904
I think you are FULL OF SHIT..

215
00:26:15,662 --> 00:26:17,712
.So Fucking Full of Shit...

216
00:26:17,772 --> 00:26:20,733
We don't belong with each other

217
00:26:20,764 --> 00:26:22,011
Wow Mr. Ijaz Khan..

218
00:26:22,698 --> 00:26:23,698
Wow...

219
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:26,772
..that is just so convenient...

220
00:26:27,113 --> 00:26:30,821
All of sudden, you wanna be
Mr. Hotshot-Fucking-Politician..

221
00:26:31,097 --> 00:26:33,485
..and you want to shed me
like excess baggage..

222
00:26:33,865 --> 00:26:35,865
that's what it is..
isn't it..?

223
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:38,736
or is it because of your wife?

224
00:26:39,655 --> 00:26:43,425
Your self-righteous bitch-of-a-wife!

225
00:26:48,924 --> 00:26:50,608
Wait.. ok.. Look..

226
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,981
I'm.. I'm Sorry, we can
talk about this..

227
00:26:55,456 --> 00:26:57,935
everything that I just said,
I didn't mean it..

228
00:26:58,385 --> 00:27:00,066
I'll be whoever you want me to be...

229
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,343
I'll do whatever you want me to do..

230
00:27:04,454 --> 00:27:06,118
I'm Sorry..

231
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,182
<i>When I heard about attack on you...</i>

232
00:27:35,382 --> 00:27:38,306
I was convinced that the attacker
could be Ramal...

233
00:27:38,481 --> 00:27:43,089
for you were the first to penetrate his
network and arrest him...

234
00:27:43,524 --> 00:27:45,439
arrest him and hand him over
to law for what?

235
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,638
..So he can escape again...

236
00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:50,995
..where would that lead me now?

237
00:27:52,288 --> 00:27:56,488
The only law that I believe in is the
one That I make with my clock..

238
00:27:56,754 --> 00:27:59,264
that law is the charge, the jury
and the executioner

239
00:28:00,537 --> 00:28:01,742
I should've killed him that day.

240
00:28:02,498 --> 00:28:05,080
Look at you..
what've you become...

241
00:28:05,097 --> 00:28:08,865
This blind rage and 
thrist for revenge..

242
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:12,227
You think I don't know what you've
been upto for the last three years..

243
00:28:32,932 --> 00:28:37,798
Who do you think, has been 
covering up for all your mess

244
00:28:42,369 --> 00:28:44,302
they got what they deserve..

245
00:28:44,509 --> 00:28:46,433
I know your pain, Mujtaba,

246
00:28:47,035 --> 00:28:48,580
Believe me, I know...

247
00:28:49,055 --> 00:28:52,071
But this is bigger than all of us...

248
00:28:53,272 --> 00:28:55,139
I am offering you a deal..

249
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:56,818
Help Us..!!

250
00:28:57,457 --> 00:28:58,592
Help Pakistan...

251
00:28:58,787 --> 00:29:01,463
I'll give you a clean slate..
for the rest of your life..

252
00:29:01,631 --> 00:29:03,352
You can give me back my life..

253
00:29:05,175 --> 00:29:07,182
Now I know the reason why I am alive...

254
00:29:07,415 --> 00:29:08,415
...Ramal..

255
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:14,531
..and there's only one thing standing
between him and Pakistan...

256
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:16,654
...Me...

257
00:29:18,026 --> 00:29:19,026
So tell me...

258
00:29:21,246 --> 00:29:22,713
Where is the Bastard..

259
00:29:28,611 --> 00:29:32,708
We've reasons to believe that Pakistan
is gonna be hit by a major toerrorist attack

260
00:29:32,755 --> 00:29:34,863
We also have reason to believe that 
the plan has already been...

261
00:29:34,863 --> 00:29:39,020
...contracted for.. and the 
executioner is already here...

262
00:29:39,332 --> 00:29:44,277
..and yet here we are, wasting
our time with some.. "has-been"...

263
00:29:45,109 --> 00:29:47,317
You know, what'll be really nice...

264
00:29:48,234 --> 00:29:52,008
..if you can stop focusing on yourself for a 
and change start focusing on your country...

265
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:55,860
'cause if this plan is as serious as 
I think it is... I assure you...

266
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,681
It Will be devastating...

267
00:29:59,253 --> 00:30:00,653
Where did you dig her up from?

268
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:05,400
Ever heard of the FIA?

269
00:30:05,956 --> 00:30:08,345
I was the AD for the Special
Investigation Unit...

270
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:12,255
..& I am the Chief Communication and Intel
Analyst at the CDGT...

271
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:14,337
Is there any thing else?

272
00:30:14,393 --> 00:30:16,443
Well that makes you a Police Officer!

273
00:30:17,263 --> 00:30:19,983
Aren't Police and Intelligence, 
two different things..

274
00:30:21,652 --> 00:30:24,672
So are Brains and Army Officers, 
Aren't they...?

275
00:30:25,097 --> 00:30:29,938
..and yet here we are, trying to convince 
you, of all the people, to protect our country..

276
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:33,027
Let me... think about it...

277
00:30:59,955 --> 00:31:02,743
I want to say to all of you that...

278
00:31:03,515 --> 00:31:05,519
..it is the need of the hour...

279
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:09,070
..that we sign the "Peace-Pact"...

280
00:31:10,223 --> 00:31:11,965
This can't happen, Molana Sahib...

281
00:31:12,409 --> 00:31:14,031
We'll fight till our last breathe...

282
00:31:14,648 --> 00:31:18,299
Our Warriors will send these Pakistani
Armymen to hell for sure..

283
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:24,231
Anger[Peevishness] and Reality are 
two different things...

284
00:31:24,595 --> 00:31:27,418
What your warriors have
achieved till now?

285
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:30,946
Only 6 of Pakistan Armymen have..

286
00:31:31,218 --> 00:31:34,771
...made 700 of your warriors 
flee like a coward dog...

287
00:31:35,513 --> 00:31:37,643
Is this your Warriors' progress..?

288
00:31:37,794 --> 00:31:38,794
What do we do?

289
00:31:40,191 --> 00:31:41,391
..Accept our defeat..?

290
00:31:41,491 --> 00:31:43,039
..surrender ourselves to them?

291
00:31:44,755 --> 00:31:46,025
I think my friends..

292
00:31:46,287 --> 00:31:48,719
We should increase our attacks
inside Pakistan..

293
00:31:49,411 --> 00:31:52,493
We can't beat Pak-Army here,
So what...!

294
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:56,060
We'll strike beyond their imaginations..

295
00:31:56,868 --> 00:31:58,329
What do you think...

296
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:03,235
An injured Lion is less dangerous...?

307
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:40,716
But Molana, this will force us to
stop our activities..

308
00:32:41,116 --> 00:32:43,294
we'll be serving Pak-Army...

309
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:46,615

Good wins every evil in the end..

352
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:36,471
You even breathe, and I'll
blow your brains out..

353
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:39,290
You know what..

354
00:39:40,235 --> 00:39:41,518
You're right...

355

Lemme give you two options here...

You let me go...

358

you go back to your sweet life...

Why don'tcha go-Fuck-Yourself...

369
00:40:45,236 --> 00:40:46,542
Are you crazy...

370
00:40:46,542 --> 00:40:48,584
You almost killed your sister..

371
00:40:49,869 --> 00:40:51,890

372
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,263

Do I make myself clear...
YES, SIR.

00:41:05,306 --> 00:41:06,628
Major Mujtaba...

376
00:41:13,025 --> 00:41:15,052
I was told that you'd 
be joining us...

381
00:42:04,093 --> 00:42:05,093

Ok Sir, I've Hot-wired our communication 
routers with all major mobile networks..

388
00:44:29,355 --> 00:44:33,817
My new program not only lets us 
listen every conversation on the phone..

389
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:37,662
It also cuts down the tracking
and triangulating time in half..

390
00:44:38,061 --> 00:44:40,177
So all data is scrambledand , 
when I say it's a secured line...

Major Mujtaba, is the only person
who has seen Ramal in action..

393
00:44:44,985 --> 00:44:48,447
He can identify him physically,
and also by his methods as well..

394
00:44:48,879 --> 00:44:49,824
So listen to him...

395
00:44:49,941 --> 00:44:52,691
If intel indicates that Ramal is 
already in the country,

396
00:44:53,321 --> 00:44:54,477
What do you think he's upto?

397
00:44:54,812 --> 00:44:58,889
An operative of Ramal's status doesn't
until he has a clear target...

398
00:45:03,439 --> 00:45:05,807
..and for that he needs a 
lot of finance and uh..

399
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,196
...A lot of planing...

400
00:45:07,678 --> 00:45:10,376

-Yes, ...

Why are they sending their money?

00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:40,000
tell me how's your life going?

521
00:59:41,104 --> 00:59:42,918
and who were you talking to
on the phone..

522
00:59:42,918 --> 00:59:44,553
who's luck has ended?

523
00:59:44,983 --> 00:59:49,126
Just some of my friends..
who have conflicts with some people...

524
00:59:49,636 --> 00:59:50,998
I'm there to remove the conflict..

525
00:59:51,395 --> 00:59:52,594
I don't understand...

526
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:54,439
Very simple...

527
00:59:55,284 --> 00:59:57,318
If two countries are belligerent
to each other...

528
00:59:58,153 --> 00:59:59,977
and they don't wanna fight...

529
01:00:00,391 --> 01:00:02,984
they can fight here very easily...

530
01:00:03,492 --> 01:00:05,189
the good thing about it is that...

531
01:00:05,189 --> 01:00:07,606
Only Pakistani will die...

532
01:00:08,045 --> 01:00:10,528
Pakisan is a nation for whom...

533
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:14,476
nobody in the world 
mourns on her people's death..

534
01:00:15,573 --> 01:00:16,687
not even their own people..

535
01:00:17,185 --> 01:00:18,549
Wow Molana, Wow...

536
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:20,645
What a nice business...

537
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:23,416
Business is very old one...

538
01:00:24,043 --> 01:00:29,113
what do they call the shops in 
foreign countries where you get everything..?

539
01:00:29,831 --> 01:00:30,831
One Stop Shop..

540
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:34,096
yes..

541
01:00:34,413 --> 01:00:37,710
<i>One Stop Shop</i>

542
01:00:41,438 --> 01:00:43,444
Please tell me about your business..

543
01:00:43,635 --> 01:00:46,724
Booming because of you and 
your little angels...

544
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:50,678
We've never earned so much profit..

545
01:00:51,986 --> 01:00:53,849
I needed a truck for the 
rest of the money...

546
01:00:54,255 --> 01:00:58,183
That's I've transferred all the money to
your off-shore account, like last time..

547
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,759
what about the material I sent for?

548
01:01:06,699 --> 01:01:10,137
Molana, It's harmless on the outside..

549
01:01:10,518 --> 01:01:13,301
But if mixed properly...

550
01:01:15,529 --> 01:01:19,046
These two drums are enough
for whole this area...

551
01:01:46,345 --> 01:01:47,741
Bad Dream..?

552
01:01:53,808 --> 01:01:55,054
Coffee..

553
01:01:57,055 --> 01:01:58,522
Nice...

554
01:01:59,698 --> 01:02:01,423
Didn't think you could smile..

555
01:02:05,056 --> 01:02:06,953
You know, about the other day...

556
01:02:07,407 --> 01:02:09,321
I think we started on wrong foot!

557
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:14,525
I was just wondering if you'd like to 
press the reset button..

558
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:17,096
Sure...

559
01:02:20,382 --> 01:02:21,382
Hi..

560
01:02:22,149 --> 01:02:23,149
I'm Javeria...

561
01:02:24,351 --> 01:02:25,351
Mujtaba...

562
01:02:26,681 --> 01:02:27,681
Yeah, I know..

563
01:02:31,124 --> 01:02:34,118
Do you wanna work on Hameed Khan Case Evidence?
-Sure...

564
01:02:34,764 --> 01:02:36,060
-come...
-Great...

565
01:02:57,425 --> 01:02:59,225
I've a confession to make..

566
01:02:59,507 --> 01:03:00,507
What?

567
01:03:03,539 --> 01:03:05,366
I went through your files...

568
01:03:09,993 --> 01:03:14,121
I know about your pain,
I know how you feel.. I've been thr..

569
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,040
Look..

570
01:03:16,028 --> 01:03:18,295
I don't need no sympathy.. Right..

571
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:22,022
That's not what I meant..

572
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:30,061
I just needed you to know that if...

573
01:03:30,422 --> 01:03:32,951
..you ever wanna talk about something,
I am right here...

574
01:03:51,805 --> 01:03:54,554
Thank you for coming to press conferrence..

575
01:03:55,418 --> 01:03:58,645
I didn't came for you,

576
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:02,034
I went there for righteous cause...

577
01:04:03,437 --> 01:04:04,944
..cause you're fighting for...

578
01:04:14,675 --> 01:04:16,608
I've to take this phone call..

579
01:04:20,105 --> 01:04:21,478
Please...!

580
01:04:22,151 --> 01:04:23,495
Don't be like this...

581
01:04:23,959 --> 01:04:25,631
Do whatever you want...

582
01:04:29,368 --> 01:04:31,171
Yes..

583
01:04:32,397 --> 01:04:34,270
Thank You so much..

584
01:04:45,777 --> 01:04:48,088
Yes..

585
01:04:51,664 --> 01:04:55,077
Shah Sahab, I'll talk to in a moment...

586
01:04:55,077 --> 01:04:56,991
Turn on the generator...

587
01:04:57,368 --> 01:04:58,784
Power-outage here...

588
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:04,137
That's why this country needs dam..
for this damn electricity-outages...

589
01:05:39,813 --> 01:05:41,366
I know my dear...

590
01:05:42,889 --> 01:05:45,832
That my words don't mean anything
to you now...

591
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,294
I know that you...

592
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:53,910
the pain you're suffering...

593
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:57,556
But please try to understand...

594
01:05:57,864 --> 01:06:01,175
Once this dam is built,
then all of my time...

595
01:06:02,006 --> 01:06:04,313
I'll spend all my time with you
and my baby...

596
01:06:05,284 --> 01:06:05,984
ok?

597
01:06:07,105 --> 01:06:08,154
So everything settled?

598
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:09,920
I'm gonna freshen up...

599
01:06:10,122 --> 01:06:12,591
then we'll talk about all the things...

600
01:09:08,926 --> 01:09:10,517
Ijaz Khan was a good man..

601
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:13,001
A true leader..

602
01:09:14,461 --> 01:09:16,393
a leader that our country had needed..

603
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,511
things like these happen...

604
01:09:18,818 --> 01:09:21,432
The wife was killed with this cut 
on her throat and..

605
01:09:22,432 --> 01:09:25,368
Ijaz Khan with a stab wound 
on side of his abdomen...

606
01:09:25,585 --> 01:09:28,407
A perfect eight inch cut indicates
very steady hand...

607
01:09:32,776 --> 01:09:36,482
the stab wound of Ijaz Khan indicates
very sick mind...

608
01:09:37,388 --> 01:09:39,718
the killer didn't wanted him 
to die instantly!

609
01:09:41,311 --> 01:09:43,639
He wounded him to suffer...

610
01:09:45,150 --> 01:09:47,681
You know who else uses 
this kind of torture..???

611
01:09:49,048 --> 01:09:50,034
Who.?

612
01:09:50,034 --> 01:09:51,034
Ramal...

613
01:09:51,864 --> 01:09:52,864
sad...

614
01:09:53,071 --> 01:09:55,331
All three of them just.. gone!

615
01:09:56,745 --> 01:09:57,838
Three? 
What do you by three?

616
01:10:03,231 --> 01:10:04,653
She was pregnant...

617
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:25,391
Why does it has to be children?

618
01:10:27,398 --> 01:10:30,181
I don't understand how someone could
be so heartless..

619
01:10:31,946 --> 01:10:33,901
Don't worry about the next package!

620
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:36,482
I'll deliver the aid myself!

621
01:10:38,647 --> 01:10:40,831
I know, but I don't want 
any of you there!

622
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:42,596
It's too dangerous..

623
01:11:18,868 --> 01:11:22,401
I've got an MP5 Assault rifle
pointed right at you..

624
01:11:22,706 --> 01:11:24,405
and I'm a surgeon with it...

625
01:11:39,139 --> 01:11:41,411
Can I have my last cigarette?

626
01:12:17,651 --> 01:12:18,769
How long you've been here?

627
01:12:21,816 --> 01:12:23,378
You look different in pictures...

628
01:12:25,391 --> 01:12:27,388
I didn't came here for complements...

629
01:12:28,081 --> 01:12:29,948
I need to get to my target..

630
01:12:30,603 --> 01:12:31,957
We've worked on that already..

631
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:33,724
you leave first thing 
in the morning

632
01:12:34,315 --> 01:12:37,002
Your work on Ijaz Khan was very useful!

633
01:12:38,013 --> 01:12:38,675
Thank You!

634
01:12:39,331 --> 01:12:41,542
You could've a little bit 
less dramatic though...

635
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,027
Well I told you...

636
01:12:44,659 --> 01:12:45,827
I'll do it my way...

637
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:50,501
We need to finish what we started,
sooner then later...

638
01:12:51,392 --> 01:12:53,258
I need to finish my bomb!

639
01:12:53,479 --> 01:12:55,491
..atleast a day ahead from our schedule...

640
01:12:55,797 --> 01:12:57,979
I can't trust your monkeys 
with the chemicals...

641
01:12:58,364 --> 01:13:00,189
My Monkeys...

642
01:13:00,189 --> 01:13:03,965
and those little angels are the reason
we're so successful..

643
01:13:04,175 --> 01:13:06,179
Don't under-estimate the Pakis...

644
01:13:07,123 --> 01:13:09,482
They have the capacity to.. surprise..

645
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:13,704
There've been a pain in your 
governemt's asses for some time..

646
01:13:16,234 --> 01:13:18,205
If wasn't for us...

647
01:13:18,441 --> 01:13:21,249
you'd have not been successful in
your operations..

648
01:13:22,487 --> 01:13:23,914
True...

649
01:13:25,976 --> 01:13:28,479
So, What do you propose we do?

650
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:35,679
We need to divert their attention
somewhere else...

651
01:13:37,092 --> 01:13:38,969
arrangement for that...

652
01:13:39,712 --> 01:13:41,379
have already been made...

653
01:13:42,494 --> 01:13:44,370
So why here?

654
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:46,328
So where's the body at?

655
01:13:48,185 --> 01:13:49,815
The Police Academy..

656
01:14:03,262 --> 01:14:05,262
I have very bad stomach-ache..

657
01:14:05,872 --> 01:14:07,264
Please take me to the hospital..

658
01:14:08,344 --> 01:14:09,730
Be patient now..

659
01:14:12,711 --> 01:14:14,092
I can't bear it...

660
01:14:14,093 --> 01:14:15,093
We're here...

661
01:14:33,426 --> 01:14:35,480

01:22:25,619 --> 01:22:27,052
and those who were alive..

699
01:22:28,772 --> 01:22:30,670
who wish they were dead too...

700
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:10,859
<i>[Scoffs]</i>

701
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:12,666
We're not afraid of dying..

702
01:23:24,352 --> 01:23:26,034
You cannot break me...

703
01:23:34,670 --> 01:23:36,345
We call her "NADRA" by the way!

704
01:23:36,768 --> 01:23:38,021
It's not her..

705
01:23:38,424 --> 01:23:40,891
Its a database Mr. Jamal of Chack 37!

706
01:23:43,286 --> 01:23:45,280
Now I know who you are, 
Where your family lives,

707
01:23:45,461 --> 01:23:47,560
He shouldn't have tortured him like that!

708
01:23:47,781 --> 01:23:49,637
etc. etc., so here is the deal..!

709
01:23:49,825 --> 01:23:52,207
To get an omelette, we have 
to break some eggs..

710
01:23:53,664 --> 01:23:55,635
You tell me what I want to know,

711
01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:58,623
..and I let you and your family live...

712
01:23:59,188 --> 01:24:00,322
not only that...

713
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:02,857
I'll take your family, out of this country..

714
01:24:03,755 --> 01:24:04,974
to a safe place...

715
01:24:05,685 --> 01:24:06,795
sounds good?

716
01:24:07,788 --> 01:24:11,684
I'll die before I help you!

717
01:24:13,915 --> 01:24:14,986
Fair enough...

718
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:16,393
Let me..

719
01:24:17,632 --> 01:24:19,064
Let me put it to you
this way...

720
01:24:19,835 --> 01:24:22,454
You are two people, and I only need one!

721
01:24:23,038 --> 01:24:24,902
This'll help you think better..!

722
01:24:38,694 --> 01:24:40,115
You're a Police Officer...

723
01:24:40,971 --> 01:24:42,027
You cannot do this to us...

724
01:24:42,317 --> 01:24:43,258
-We're Pakistani Blood...

725
01:24:46,285 --> 01:24:47,907
I'm not a Policeman...

726
01:24:48,770 --> 01:24:50,137
and you're not a Pakistani...

727
01:24:51,307 --> 01:24:53,080
I'm your worst nightmare...

728
01:24:53,697 --> 01:24:56,972
and If you'll ever recall yourself
a Pakistani again...

729
01:24:58,070 --> 01:25:01,318
I'll introduce to such pain that you
can't even fucking imagine...

730
01:25:02,146 --> 01:25:03,288
You understand it?

731
01:25:07,898 --> 01:25:08,932
You know I...

732
01:25:09,536 --> 01:25:10,968
Try to reason with you and....

733
01:25:11,456 --> 01:25:13,323
Give you opportunity to express yourselves..

734
01:25:13,613 --> 01:25:15,103
But I'll guess that's not happening, 
Right?

735
01:25:15,878 --> 01:25:17,385
So I'll move to the next step!

736
01:25:18,304 --> 01:25:20,153
Yea Ehtasham,

01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:23,412

Own by a guy named "Molvi Abdullah"..

741
01:25:31,898 --> 01:25:33,577
The family consists of...

742
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:36,391
Five people, two females, three males..

743
01:25:37,361 --> 01:25:39,655
The younger one is Zareena, 
Shoot her first...

744
01:25:40,142 --> 01:25:41,739

745

I don't want any faces.. -LISTEN..

01:25:45,065 --> 01:25:46,501
-Just wait....
-No

747
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:47,728
Wait.. I'm talking, Ok..

748
01:25:48,093 --> 01:25:49,693

-Listen to me..

749
01:25:50,254 --> 01:25:51,886
-Wait, Wait..
-You cannot do this..Listen..

750
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,413
-Listen, Listen..Please...Please...

751
01:25:55,565 --> 01:25:58,123
-Too much noise, You're saying...

752
01:25:58,595 --> 01:25:59,595
Is he crazy...?

753
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:01,193
Did he just kill him..?

754
01:26:03,611 --> 01:26:05,786
No he knew exactly, where to shoot...

755
01:26:05,786 --> 01:26:07,003
Ok...

756
01:26:08,068 --> 01:26:09,752
I'll tell you everything...

757
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:11,047
Hold On..

758
01:26:11,602 --> 01:26:12,602
Yeah..

759
01:26:15,286 --> 01:26:17,383
We work for Mulla Siraj..

760
01:26:24,681 --> 01:26:27,042
Thank You gentlemen, oh Sorry
-Thank You...

761
01:26:32,407 --> 01:26:33,740
Aslam-o-Alaikum Sir,

762
01:26:34,501 --> 01:26:35,924
What is this location...

763
01:26:36,463 --> 01:26:37,992
Yogazai Fort, Sir..

764
01:26:42,052 --> 01:26:47,154
Are you goin for Civil Armed Force!
There is no police in that area..

765
01:26:47,931 --> 01:26:50,002
I think we need to bring 
the Army on this one, Sir.

766
01:26:50,848 --> 01:26:52,922
How many men do you think
he has over there?

767
01:26:53,511 --> 01:26:56,528
Safe estimate, about 800 heavily armed men

768
01:26:59,325 --> 01:27:01,346
I'll speak to General Genjua...

769
01:27:01,346 --> 01:27:04,141
You'll need to debrief the 
Commanders on Ground...

770
01:27:04,393 --> 01:27:05,754
Sir, We'd like to do more..

771
01:27:06,699 --> 01:27:08,297
We'dlike to fight as well Sir..

772
01:27:11,066 --> 01:27:15,801
You'll fight just because you are
A Police Officer..

773
01:27:16,321 --> 01:27:20,459
Your duty is only to arrest the culprit
and hand him over to the law...

774
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:25,643
Go and do your job,

775
01:27:25,643 --> 01:27:28,899
..and make this country proud of its protectors...

776
01:28:33,345 --> 01:28:34,878
Sir, Where is my stuff?

777
01:28:35,076 --> 01:28:36,518
Everything is ready...

778
01:28:37,499 --> 01:28:39,543
Would you like some rest before
you start your work...

779
01:28:40,258 --> 01:28:41,668
I've made arrangements for you!

780
01:28:42,179 --> 01:28:43,109
There's no time...

781
01:28:43,661 --> 01:28:47,000
and the Police Academy drama 
won't last for long...

782
01:28:47,499 --> 01:28:48,716
That's not possible...

783
01:28:49,378 --> 01:28:51,177
None of my men will be taken alive...

784
01:28:51,563 --> 01:28:54,308
I don't take any chances,
Show me the way...

785

By God, My soul is in agony...

808
01:32:12,236 --> 01:32:13,859
for the vengence of my fellows...

809
01:32:14,273 --> 01:32:16,191
But I can't do it...

810
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:19,653
Because, Like all of you..

811
01:32:21,079 --> 01:32:23,905

of this country...

812

Go through the fort very carefully..

878
01:43:49,163 --> 01:43:50,683
<i>We're looking for two bombs..</i>

879
01:43:51,106 --> 01:43:53,011

<i>and its ticking...</i>

881
01:43:56,049 --> 01:43:57,049
<i>Four minutes...</i>

882
01:43:57,338 --> 01:43:59,757
<i>-Is there a way to defuse it?</i>
-Can you defuse it?

885

Hello!

886
01:44:49,919 --> 01:44:51,412
Hello?

887
01:44:52,059 --> 01:44:53,971
Hello?

888
01:47:15,651 --> 01:47:18,563
You've left me all alone...!

889
01:47:21,986 --> 01:47:26,365
everybody else wanted to be
doctors or engineers...

890
01:47:27,512 --> 01:47:29,563
and pilots.. but no..

891
01:47:31,165 --> 01:47:33,959
You had to be a police officer..!

892
01:47:36,622 --> 01:47:38,201
just wanted to protect the weak..

893
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:39,814
and you did...

894
01:47:40,962 --> 01:47:42,398
what about me?

895
01:47:44,753 --> 01:47:45,753
what about me?

896
01:47:50,832 --> 01:47:52,920
the essence of who we are...

897
01:47:53,294 --> 01:47:57,535
is our ability to bear immense amount 
of pain and loss...

898
01:47:59,221 --> 01:48:00,112
Mujtaba...

899
01:48:00,598 --> 01:48:02,289
You've never been a stranger to this..!

900

I miss you...
<i>[Whimpering]</i>

901

You need to pick yourself up..!

902
01:48:19,274 --> 01:48:21,465
You still have one more bomb to find

903
01:48:22,051 --> 01:48:23,539
and Ramal is still out there...

904
01:48:24,784 --> 01:48:26,044
Not for long, Sir...

905
01:48:27,493 --> 01:48:28,493
Not for long...

906
01:48:36,135 --> 01:48:37,665
You take all your pain...

907
01:48:37,830 --> 01:48:39,488
anger and frustration..

908
01:48:40,554 --> 01:48:42,574
you turn it into this fire of hell..

909
01:48:44,135 --> 01:48:48,504
the fire which burns anythin and everything
that's killing your pain...

910
01:48:49,511 --> 01:48:51,177
and you give them pain...

911
01:48:52,387 --> 01:48:53,803
you hurt them...

912
01:48:55,752 --> 01:48:57,058
so all these years....

913
01:48:57,486 --> 01:48:58,873
this is what you have been doing?

914
01:49:11,167 --> 01:49:12,367
He's a good kid...

915
01:49:13,486 --> 01:49:15,070
He's a really good kid...

916
01:50:03,582 --> 01:50:04,582
Coffee?

917
01:50:04,672 --> 01:50:06,372
thanks..

918
01:50:08,522 --> 01:50:09,717
what are you working on?

919
01:50:12,213 --> 01:50:15,591
Isn't the bomb already destroyed, 
the entire network disbanded?

920
01:50:26,386 --> 01:50:29,383

924
01:51:00,870 --> 01:51:02,918
It's the convention center...

<i>-It is indeed an honor, for me, for

<i>We shall no longer take dictation from anyone...</i>

929
01:51:34,924 --> 01:51:35,799
<i>Now,</i>

930
01:51:36,528 --> 01:51:39,048
<i>It is time for me to make
some announcements...</i>

931
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:40,824
<i>For the future of country...</i>

932
01:51:40,824 --> 01:51:42,691
<i>To the future of the country</i>

933
01:51:56,729 --> 01:52:00,685
<i>this will not only increase our revenue
by $20 Billion...</i>

934
01:52:01,378 --> 01:52:04,194
<i>but it'll also usher a new era!</i>

935
01:53:14,085 --> 01:53:16,267
I just saw Ramal come out of
Room 209...

936
01:53:16,716 --> 01:53:17,709
I think the bomb is there..

937
01:53:17,955 --> 01:53:20,686
You go after Ramal, 
I'll find the bomb...

938
01:53:21,428 --> 01:53:22,404
Mujtaba...

939
01:53:23,395 --> 01:53:24,937
Be very careful...

940
01:53:25,364 --> 01:53:26,897
He's nothing to lose...

941
01:55:05,275 --> 01:55:07,464
We both are the same...

942
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:12,303
So why fight...

943
01:55:12,566 --> 01:55:13,669
there are two paths..

944
01:55:14,307 --> 01:55:16,440
good and evil...

945
01:55:16,762 --> 01:55:18,539
I follow the good path..

946
01:55:19,393 --> 01:55:21,199
and as the good book says..

947
01:55:21,829 --> 01:55:23,547
Good wins evil in the end,..

948
01:55:24,067 --> 01:55:25,398
but in my book..!

949
01:55:26,617 --> 01:55:28,137
Evil wins in the end...

950
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:30,395
I guess you're readin the wrong book...

951
01:55:30,496 --> 01:55:32,940
I'm going to kill you today Mujtaba...

952
01:55:34,437 --> 01:55:35,539
The way...

953
01:55:36,075 --> 01:55:37,636
I killed you family...

954
01:55:38,997 --> 01:55:40,912
You just killed them that day...

955
01:55:42,376 --> 01:55:43,734
You killed me too...

956
01:55:45,223 --> 01:55:48,142
and what you see today in front of
you is a dead man...

957
01:55:49,801 --> 01:55:52,369
and you can't kill what's already dead...

958
01:55:54,202 --> 01:55:56,504
I've waited for this whole my life

959
01:55:57,860 --> 01:55:58,420
Death..

960
01:55:59,321 --> 01:56:01,121
is a five letter word Ramal..

961
01:56:02,161 --> 01:56:03,518
But I promise you!

962
01:56:04,651 --> 01:56:06,608
