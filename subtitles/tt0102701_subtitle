1
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,520
I have to go. When you know that, send me off with a smile.

2
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,480
Come on, smile. Smile, darn it.

3
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,640
But why must you go when it is not compulsory?

4
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,240
It is compulsory. - You liar!

5
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,440
Asha's brother too is in the army. He say's it's not compulsory.

6
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,360
He belongs to the supply corps.

7
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,480
ASC, Army Service Course.

8
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,680
It's not compulsory for them. But it is for us. Okay?

9
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,640
Liar! We've just got engaged.

10
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,320
Soon we'll be married. That's why I must go.

11
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,000
I have to be tough, strong to lead a life with you.

12
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,640
May I help you?

13
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Tell me to do something. I know Shirley will manage from now.

14
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,520
Anything I can do?

15
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,920
No need to work for him! Compulsory! Lying to us!

16
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,320
The army won't standstill if he doesn't become a commando!

17
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,920
Liar!

18
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,280
She's calling me a liar.

19
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,600
She never came to watch my matches in college.

20
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I can't bear to see you lose.

21
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,520
She has no confidence in me.

22
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,160
Why must you go when it's not compulsory?

23
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,080
You want to go? Yes? Then go!

24
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,520
I won't marry you! To hell with you!

25
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,000
Why are you losing your shirt? Let him go.

26
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,560
You are destined to marry a soldier.

27
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,560
You too? You too? Okay.

28
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,400
Where do I keep your shoes?

29
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,480
The place is right but they will slip off.

30
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,880
You're with him.. what's this?

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,520
Is this the time to smoke? Becomes Churchill when he's nervous!

32
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,120
Arrange it. I'll get back.

33
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,080
You must study further. - I will.

34
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,480
I intend to study but it will have to be along with service.

35
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,920
Younger brother's education is important. - Chiku!

36
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,000
What's wrong with you?

37
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,720
Why are you sad? C'mon cheer up.

38
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,840
I'll return soon. - The lady upstairs is also leaving.

39
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,240
Paying guest aunty!

40
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,560
Yes, she has finished exams and is going to Pune today.

41
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,280
But what's your problem? - Who'll tell me stories?

42
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,920
That's a major problem.

43
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,040
When I return, I'll be a story in myself.

44
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,000
And you can watch and hear it.

45
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,840
Then you may go.

46
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,640
Eat this.

47
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,680
"puranpoli'? (Sweet rolled bread) Wow!

48
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,840
Sister, you are great. Just great.

49
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,520
These are the things that hold me back.

50
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,320
Your "puranpoli', Chiku's prattle.

51
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,280
Shirley's tantrums and Dad's loneliness.

52
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,920
Real nice.

53
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,320
I'm leaving for commando training. I know you'd have been happy.

54
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,720
Keep an eye on him.

55
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,000
Till he finishes studies..

56
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,080
.. no TV and no video for him.

57
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,120
Right, Chiku? - Right, sir.

58
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,320
Come back soon. - Okay.

59
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,640
You're not alone now. Shirley is with you so take care.

60
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,160
Bye, see you. Bye, sister.

61
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,440
What's happening? Why are you giving them money?

62
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,000
My brother has come to see you.

63
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,240
He's been waiting for long. - Listen to me.

64
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,880
Hi, uncle Willy. - Hi.

65
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,120
Ready to leave? - I'm packing for him!

66
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,920
I explained so much to him but he refuses to listen!

67
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,640
And.. my father-in-law!

68
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,920
He's joined the enemy camp! - Why do you scream so much?

69
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,840
You too? Okay!

70
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,400
I know everything.

71
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,160
Shirley for God sake, please.

72
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,520
Going, Peter? All the best.

73
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,520
Take care because you're getting married soon.

74
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,000
You have to be careful, okay? - Yes, I have to be careful.

75
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,000
He will. I know he'll take care of himself.

76
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,680
You don't worry, okay?

77
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,320
Why the photo? What will you do?

78
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,520
Why do you want to carry the photo?

79
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,440
What do you want? Get out!

80
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,240
What's wrong with you? Peter's friend has come to see him.

81
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,000
I know why he's come! Get lost!

82
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,680
Your army has no human feelings.

83
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,000
You've just got engaged. And you're leaving your fiancee.

84
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,600
I'm feeling very sad.

85
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,240
Don't act! I know how sad you are!

86
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,680
I told you not to give him cash! You know what he does!

87
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,520
Return it!

88
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,800
Keep it.

89
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,880
Time to leave.

90
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,080
Give up these drugs.

91
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,520
Peter!

92
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,520
Who will take these? - What?

93
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,000
Who will take these? - What is that?

94
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,480
Didn't you forget something? - What..?

95
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,120
Sir, please write your name, unit and command.

96
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,520
Please sit in the vehicle.

97
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,400
Finished bathing? - No.

98
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,120
Raina is taking a long time.

99
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,480
Diganto. - Yes?

100
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,680
Very strict training. You'll grow even shorter.

101
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:28,080
If we get stuck in Major Chavan's group, we've had it.

102
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,120
Have you had papads? - Yes I have.

103
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,320
Is he so strict?

104
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,520
Can't be worse than NDA.

105
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,480
He's puts you through rigourous training, rips your underwear!

106
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,440
Then gradually you get one stitch at a time.

107
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,280
I've brought it on my palm.

108
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,000
Are you describing Chavan or a tank?

109
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,880
We've seen worse. We'll see him too.

110
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,120
Why are you already worried?

111
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,440
How do you know him so well?

112
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,920
How can you forget him? He's one son-of-a-bitch.

113
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,480
He was my platoon commander in the first term at NDA.

114
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,000
Then he was a captain. Now he is a Major.

115
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,680
He is businessman. - Forget it.

116
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,560
He's a bloody pain. You know where.

117
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,520
You've got high hopes.

118
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,240
Diganto will gain. - How?

119
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,120
His eyes will open. - Only his eyes?

120
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,880
Quiet. He'll teach us something. - Sure.

121
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,040
Give me a cigarette.

122
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,720
You're not allowed to smoke here. You'll get court martialled.

123
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,680
You have to fall in at the PT ground at 4.00 in the morning.

124
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,520
Listen to that. 4 in the morning?

125
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,160
Welcome Jokers.

126
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,720
I'm Major Chavan from 2nd Maratha 5th battalion.

127
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,320
At ease.

128
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,800
You are here for commando training not for a picnic!

129
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,640
We turn youngsters into youth and youth into fearless commandos.

130
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,320
A commando's motto is, the tough get going when the going gets tough.

131
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,360
Now I'll tell you about the activities of the next 35 days.

132
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,000
First training for a few days to make your muscles tough.

133
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,600
Then BOC, UC.

134
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,520
That is battle obstacle course and unarmed combat.

135
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,000
Then confidence jump, survival training.

136
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,800
You will be taught explosive and demolition.

137
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,520
Assault charge..

138
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,560
Advanced steel cutting technique will be taught.

139
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,280
Living off the land and making of traps, marking routes.

140
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Rock climbing technique.

141
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,240
Practice carrying a partner to increase endurance.

142
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And climbing down a chopper from a rope ladder will be taught.

143
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,760
I want to tell you one thing before the training begins.

144
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,320
For its' success, I need your co-operation, excitement.

145
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And firm will.

146
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,320
If a joker has some administrative or organisation problem in training..

147
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,320
He can meet the Admin. JCO or Organ. JCO.

148
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,640
It's a different issue that after training from 4 am to 11 pm..

149
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,920
No joker will find time to meet them.

150
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,400
You will probably get 4 hours of sleep at night.

151
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,120
That will be your entertainment.

152
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,240
Does any joker have any doubts regarding the briefing?

153
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,320
There shouldn't be any.

154
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,320
Now you will introduce yourselves.

155
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,600
Commando Ahmed Khan, sir!

156
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,880
Commando Sikander sir! - Don't talk like a sixty. Talk like a soldier!

157
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,520
Commando Sikander sir!

158
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,800
Commando Peter D'Souza sir!

159
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,920
Commando Ajay Morey sir!

160
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,920
Go on. What's the problem?

161
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,120
Sir, I'm scared of heights.

162
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,440
Go on. What's the problem?

163
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,520
Hold here, like this and go..

164
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,600
What's difficult? Come on.

165
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,560
Give me the rope. What's the problem?

166
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,320
What's the problem?

167
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,760
Come here. What's it?

168
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,440
Commando.. - Keep this leg here.

169
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,640
Here, like this. Touch the hip.

170
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,880
Like this. First balance yourself.

171
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,920
Now go.

172
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,920
This steep climb will kill me..

173
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,120
What are you doing? If Chavan sees you..

174
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,760
The tough get going when the going gets tough!

175
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:41,000
Commando Sikander reports on completion of activity.

176
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,800
Commando Morey reports on completion of activity.

177
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,040

179
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,000
Jump!

180

181
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,000

Stop.

185
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,160
Commando Peter and commando Khan, fall out.

186
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,920
Completed the obstacles successfully?

187
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
Any problem in the steep climb? - A little.

188
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,520
A little?

189
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,760
Commando Khandagle made best timing in today's practice.

190
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,480
One good observation.

191
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,240
Right turn.

192
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,320
May we drink water sir? - Sure.

193
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,440
Thursday. It's dry.

194
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,480
There's no water sir. Thursday is dry day.

195
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,680
Go running and drink water from where it is.

196
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,160
"How are you feeling? - What do you think?"

197
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:44,320
"You've become restless."

198
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,000
"I'm ruined."

199
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,280
Can't do it sir..

200
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,280
I'm scared of heights.

201
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,840
Can't do it..

202
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:12,920
The enemy of humanity took my life.

203
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,880
Who is smoking..?

204
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:23,000
Blow some smoke here too.

205
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,040
Who the hell is it?

206
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,600
There's a fly on my nose. Blow it away pal.

207
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,360
Fly off, fly..

208
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,080
Gone? - No.

209
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,720
She's also taking undue advantage.

210
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:03,320
Tell Chavan to order it 10 rounds.

211
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,880
We'll see Chavan.. how long you can survive..

212
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,720
Stand here.

213
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
What will you say Peter? - Got a sprain in my shoulder.

214
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,680
Your shoulder? Then my arm.

215
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,240
Watch me today.

216
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,280
Okay doc. - Okay. - Bye.

217
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,000
What's the problem?

218
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,240
Pain in the left arm. - Left arm

219
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,640
And you? - Sprain in the shoulder.

220
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,920
What's your problem? - My foot is hurting sir.

221
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,280
Pain in the foot, stand here. Sprain in shoulder at the back.

222
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,320
Pain in arm this side. The rest remain here.

223
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,880
Come here. What's wrong with you? - My stomach is paining.

224
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,520
Stomach?

225
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,840
Today I'll look into stomach pain. The rest I'll handle tomorrow.

226
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,600
What's the problem? - Pain in the stomach.

227
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,640
Tummy ache? - Yes sir.

228
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,680
Take off your clothes and lie there. - But my stomach hurts.

229
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,520
Undress and lie there.

230
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,440
Ram Singh. - Sir? - Stethoscope.

231
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,680
Hello Jokers. - Group, attention.

232
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,240
At ease.

233
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,400
How is your shoulder?

234
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,120
What did Doctor say? - He's called us tomorrow.

235
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,880
He believes in nature therapy. - Yes, sir.

236
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,040
Khandagle? - Yes, sir?

237
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,000
How's your stomach? - No problem sir.

238
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:27,000
How did you find the doctor? - He's nice, sir. A genius.

239
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,840
After meeting him once, nobody in the whole course has a tummy ache.

240
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,360
We'll meet in 10 minutes at the lecture stand.

241
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:58,320
"I'm missing my beloved."

242
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:04,280
"I'm missing my beloved."

243
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,280
Give my top back. Get your own.

244
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,000
"I'm youthful."

245
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
She's waiting for him. Singing doesn't fill the stomach.

246
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,000
Take her away.

247
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,680
"I'm youthful."

248
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,800
To top it she's got this nuisance!

249
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,880
"Listen to me, O Spring."

250
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,800
"I'm youthful. - Mom."

251
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,240
"Listen to me, O Spring."

252
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,000
Give me money for a top.

253
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,680
"I'm becoming old."

254
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,640
"I'm missing my beloved."

255
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,640
"I'm missing my beloved."

256
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,880
"I'm missing my beloved."

257
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,560
Mother, give me money for a top.

258
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,720
Give me, mother..

259
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,040
Come, I'll give you.

260
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,680
"I'm missing my beloved."

261
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,640
Come on. - Let go my hand!

262
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,600
Let go! - Mother!

263
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,720
You come inside with me. - Let go off me.

264
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,600
I'll give you money. - I don't want it!

265
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,120
Let go! - Come on!

266
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,920
Let go!

267
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,600
I don't sell myself!

268
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,040
Help, brother!

269
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,600
Come With us quietly. - Let me go!

270
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,280
Let me go!

271
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,120
Let me go! - Quiet.

272
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,000
Mother! - My baby!

273
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,880
Let go of my mother.

274
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,280
Move aside. - Let go off her.

275
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,120
Get lost, you bastard!

276
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,320
Leave my mother alone.

277
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,320
Leave me. My baby. Leave me.

278
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,280
Let go of my mother.

279
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,480
Let me go! - Let my mother go.

280
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,720
I don't want to go with you.

281
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:14,880
Come on. - "I can't bear the pain."

282
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,720
"I'm missing my beloved."

283
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,600
"I'm missing my beloved."

284
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:29,080
"I'm missing my beloved."

285
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,440
Sir, shall I serve dinner? - What?

286
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,600
Shall I serve dinner? - No.

287
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:41,400
You may go. Switch off the light.

288
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,520
Commando Peter D'souza go.

289
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,240
Commando Peter D'souza.

290
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,080
Ready sir. - Begin.

291
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,360
Stand up! Stand and walk.

292
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,000
Well done. Proceed.

293
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,920
Commando Peter D'souza get ready for the jump.

294
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,320
Commando Peter D'souza is not ready for the jump sir!

295
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,720
Steel yourself and jump. - I'm firm I won't jump.

296
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,120
Then keep hanging there.

297
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,280
Nice jump. - Commando Khandagle! - Yes, sir.

298
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,520
Commando Khandagle ready sir! - Begin.

299
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,880
Khandagle!

300
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,800
Stand up.

301
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,000
First stand up.

302
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,640
Don't be scared. Stand. - I'm trying sir.

303
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,520
Good. Well done.

304
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,120
Come on. Move ahead.

305
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,000
Easy.. c'mon.

306
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:08,320
Come on. You have the best performance in BOC.

307
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,000
I'm going sir.

308
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,040
What are you doing sir? Why..?

309
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,080
Don't bother coming up. I am going sir.

310
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,000
Stand up, you can do it.

311
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,520
Wait.

312
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,920
I'll fall off. - You won't.

313
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:33,160
What's the problem? - It's very high.

314
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:37,680
Get up. Come on!

315
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,880
You can do it. - There's no place to keep the foot.

316
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,280
How much place does a man need to keep one foot?

317
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,680
Get up! You'll have to do it again.

318
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,560
I'll do it sir. - Now!

319
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,440
Tomorrow sir. - No, just now!

320
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,920
Sir, be careful.

321
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,600
C'mon. Stand up or I'll push you down!

322
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,000
Please, don't do that.

323
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,920
Khandagle, I'm telling you, I'll kick you. Come on, get up!

324
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,520
Only this much is left..

325
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,840
Jump down.

326
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,680
Commando Diganto.

327
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Commando Diganto ready sir. - Begin.

328
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,080
Start!

329
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,400
Well done. Proceed.

330
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,600
Can't do it sir. - What? Go ahead.

331
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Can't sir. - Move ahead!

332
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,720
Use monkey climb and go ahead.

333
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,520
I won't go ahead. I'm fine here. I won't even come down.

334
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,920
Sorry to be writing so late.

335
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,040
I get so tired after the morning to evening training..

336
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:16,000
I neither feel like doing anything or have the strength.

337
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,000
The body is not with the mind.

338
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:26,320
Sometimes I feel if I had listened to you..

339
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,120
It would have been better. Then I recall..

340
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,160
What Dad told me before I joined the army.

341
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:41,560
Look at the scene here. Who will run the business?

342
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,920
Age is not on my side. Neither is Sharon alive.

343
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,600
She delivered you and went up.

344
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,880
Had she been here, I..

345
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,560
If you leave what will I do alone?

346
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,000
Let him go!

347
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,400
Let him go! I am here, isn't it? I'll look after you.

348
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,040
You don't worry. Let him go!

349
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,640
Thinks he's a General because he got the best NCC cadet medal!

350
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,240
Still I say, don't go!

351
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,000
Don't be pigheaded, okay?

352
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,880
If you want to join the army for adventure, it's possible here too.

353
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,000
Swimming, shooting, riding, flying.

354
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,520
You can do everything here. - He's right. Think over it. Take your time.

355
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,440
I'm sorry, dad. I've taken my decision.

356
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,520
Do you have the sense to take decisions?

357
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,640
You explain to him.

358
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,520
Let him go if he likes it.

359
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,280
I support Peter.

360
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,320
Go if you want to.

361
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,800
My bakery is not very big but..

362
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:58,840
There's a line for our bread. Why? Because we're the best.

363
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,760
You have to prove by becoming the best soldier.

364
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:08,360
Promise? - I promise, dad. - I hate you. - I love you, Shirley.

365
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,440
Good day. - Good day.

366
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,800
Bring the uniform here.

367
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,440
How have you fixed the ribbon?

368
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,000
How many years have you been in the army? Fix it straight!

369
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,120
Get me some water.

370
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,440
Hello Jokers. - Sir? - Sir?

371
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,440
Good evening, sir. - Good evening.

372
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,240
Sit down. - Sir, you..

373
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,720
Sit down.

374
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,000
Checkmate in one turn.

375
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,360
No sir. Impossible in one turn.

376
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,520
Think about it.

377
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,800
You don't play chess. - No sir.

378
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,680
You must play. It's a good game for a soldier.

379
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,320
Sir, not everybody can do everything.

380
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,360
You play chess. I play the mouth organ.

381
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,160
Khan. - Yes, sir?

382
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,840
Check and mate.

383
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,400
Give it to me.

384
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,360
Won't you come for prayers? - Found my mother?

385
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,240
She'll be found.

386
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,120
Come with me.

387
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,000
"We have the stars in our fist."

388
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,640
"Whenever it opens, it will shine."

389
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,400
"We have the stars in our fist."

390
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:52,000
"Whenever it opens, it will shine."

391
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:56,760
"The star that never breaks."

392
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:01,880
"The whole world knows about it."

393
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,320
"We have the stars in our fist."

394
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,000
"Whenever it opens, it will shine."

395
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,760
"We have the stars in our fist."

396
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:20,840
"Whenever it opens, it will shine."

397
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,800
"The lines on the palm are incomplete."

398
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:34,480
"We don't want to know who wrote our destiny."

399
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:39,040
"The lines on the palm are incomplete."

400
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:44,000
"We don't want to know who wrote our destiny."

401
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,400
"No one will come to make your life beautiful."

402
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,000
"You have to consider that as your destiny."

403
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,560
"We have to create our own destiny."

404
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,880
"We have to rise and shine."

405
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,240
"The one who comes out of the darkness and shines..

406
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:18,840
..the world will recognize him."

407
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:23,680
"We have the stars in our fist."

408
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,240
"Whenever it opens, it will shine."

409
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:35,320
"We have the stars in our fist."

410
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,000
A commando's best friend is..

411
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,320
We teach you to catch snakes..

412
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,000
Because when we have nothing to eat in the forests..

413
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,920
We can live off it.

414
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,920
The commando who can eat a snake..

415
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,920
..can eat any animal.

416
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,600
Would anyone like to touch it?

417
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,680
A little ahead from Khilari..

418
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,280
I mean, before Mangal dam.

419
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,880
Hi uncle. Hi, dad.

420
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,000
Hi, Soni. Sit down. Give him company. - Okay.

421
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,760
Okay, thank you. - Okay, bye.

422
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,920
Want to join the commando wing? - No way!

423
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:09,280
These baldies of yours.. - Commandos not baldies.

424
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,120
The same thing. They whistle very well.

425
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,600
They stare at girls as if they have never seen one.

426
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,720
Who whistled?

427
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,840
They all look alike. - How did he whistle? Like so..

428
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,440
No.

429
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,400
Just like this.

430
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,400
Our mission is to destroy the enemy ammunition bunker.

431
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,800
We have only two days for this surprise mission.

432
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,920
We'll have no eatables during the mission.

433
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,120
We'll have to live off the land for survival.

434
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,360
What a discipline.

435
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,680
No commando will drink water without my permission. - Yes, sir!

436
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,040
On the way, enemy booby traps..

437
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,360
We have to steer clear of their guns.

438
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,000
If there's any danger the forward group will warn the group behind.

439
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,560
How will you do it?

440
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,240
22. - Yes, sir.

441
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
By whistling like birds.

442
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,000
Absolutely right.

443
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,000
On this mission you'll carry 2 sacks of sand weighing 15 kgs each.

444
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,120
Come on, get up.

445
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,800
Get up.

446
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,400
Come on, get up.

447
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,000
Get up, come on!

448
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,640
Tired?

449
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,320
Take it off.

450
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,880
Come here!

451
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:36,320
Your buddy is wounded. From this point you'll carry him piggy back.

452
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,240
Come on, fast.

453
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,760
Water..

454
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,320
My orders were nobody will drink water without my permission.

455
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,040
He is in a bad shape sir.

456
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,320
Put him down, Khan.

457
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,440
Peter, now you will carry him.

458
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,440
He is in a bad shape.

459
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,360
Sir, my shoulder is aching due to the weight.

460
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,520
I'm in agony. - Doctor Mathur will set it right.

461
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,080
Serves you right. You bloody clot.

462
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,640
Keep hanging there!

463
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,560
You can't leave like this.

464
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,400
Can't bear it anymore.

465
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,920
Why do you want to ruin your career?

466
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:13,280
You have to complete the course. There's no way out.

467
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,040
The unit will send you back.

468
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,560
Why don't you understand? You can be court martialled!

469
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,880
You know what you're doing? - Yes, sir.

470
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,160
I can't do it. You may fail me and send me back to my unit.

471
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,080
Show. Who is this?

472
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,880
My fiancee.

473
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,520
Tell her you've run away.

474
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,000
She'll be thrilled to marry an eunuch.

475
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,920
Tell your parents they gave birth to a eunuch not a soldier.

476
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,080
Well Jokers. - Sir!

477
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,840
Tomorrow morning after PT at the Lido tank. Good night.

478
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,360
Commando Peter. - Sir.

479
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,400
Go.

480
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,680
Commando D'souza ready sir!

481
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,120
Commando D'souza begin.

482
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,840
Commando Peter D'souza ready for jump sir!

483
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,520
On successful completion of commando training..

484
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,240
I congratulate you.

485
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:07,360
Because this training is not possible for ordinary men.

486
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:11,840
The difficulties you have overcome during the training..

487
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,800
That in itself is a major achievement.

488
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:22,000
And I believe, in every field of fighting, this victory..

489
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,800
.. will repeat itself.

490
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:28,720
At the end, I would once again..

491
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,840
..on behalf of the instructor staff of the commando wing..

492
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:36,320
..like to congratulate Commando Peter D'Souza..

493
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,360
..on being a proud recipient of the commando dagger.

494
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,840
Sir, give the order, Run joker, run!

495
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,520
I'll run straight to Shirley.

496
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:39,000
And tell me what I must tell her now?

497
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,320
Tell her I've returned a winner, not on my knees.

498
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:52,880
How's your light? - Saved before going out.

499
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,520
But Diganto has a complaint against you.

500
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,120
Why? Hey 22.

501
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,320
What's your complaint? - Nothing sir.

502
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,680
Khan said you have a grouse.

503
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,920
Sir, what a name you've given me.

504
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,920
What name?

505
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,600
22.

506
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,320
You must keep something that's been given with love.

507
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,480
Commander sir wants to see you. - I'll come by.

508
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,080
I just spoke to the General.

509
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,600
An urgent job.

510
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,240
I've chosen you to execute it.

511
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:09,320
20 children of Saint Paul School and their 2 teachers..

512
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,600
.. have been hijacked.

513
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,120
We have the task of releasing them.

514
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,320
According to the available information now..

515
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,320
At this moment..

516
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
..square 6486..

517
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,480
They are at the search point of Mangal dam.

518
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,800
The terrorists have given the government till noon tomorrow..

519
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,480
They say if their comrades are not released..

520
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,880
They will kill one child every hour.

521
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,000
We have to save those children at any cost.

522
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,320
But we have no time for rehearsal.

523
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,640
And rehearsal is a must. - Don't insist on it.

524
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:54,840
Whom will you choose as your team?

525
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,000
The officers of my group have not yet returned to their units.

526
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,320
I'll chose from them.

527
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,920
We've got some slides of that area.

528
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,400
General VK Singh will explain it to you.

529
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,920
I want that gun.

530
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:08,000
I want that gun! - Keep quiet.

531
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,000
Tell uncle to give it to me.

532
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,640
Don't insist. - Give it!

533
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:37,400
Stop crying.

534
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:22,480
You will wait here. We will return at 10.

535
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:41,080
Excuse me. May I go to pee?

536
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,160
Wait. Do it there.

537
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,000
As I said, there are 3 terrorists.

538
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,400
One is in the bus and two are on duty outside.

539
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:52,400
The left one is about 20 yards away standing in the trees.

540
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,240
The terrorist in the right is 30 yards away from the bus. Here..

541
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:05,000
You'll silence the left terrorist.

542
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,440
You will provide cover fire for your buddy.

543
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:13,320
If the terrorist in the bus tries to communicate with his comrades..

544
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,720
You will answer like this..

545
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,280
Any doubts? - No sir.

546
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,520
You have to complete this task before 0413.

547
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:33,440
I will distract the terrorist in the bus at exactly 0415.

548
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:43,080
At the sound of gunshots the right terrorist will move towards the bus.

549
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,720
You will finish him, Peter.

550
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,800
You will cover Peter.

551
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,160
Any doubts? - No, sir.

552
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,920
Set your watches.

553
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:03,440
When I say time, it will be exactly 10.30.

554
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,080
Ten. Nine.

555
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:12,360
Eight. Seven. Six.

556
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,720
Five. Four. Three.

557
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,600
Two. One.

558
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,600
I.. I don't want to go.

559
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,000
Don't.. kill me..

560
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,680
I don't want to go out.

561
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:52,760
See who it is. Get up.

562
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:57,480
Go. Properly.

563
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,640
Look behind.

564
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,640
No.. there's nobody there.

565
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:10,080
What is it? - There's some sound.

566
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,320
There's nobody.

567
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,120
Fire as soon as the door opens.

568
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:02,160
Don't be scared. Sit down. This is the army.

569
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:33,160
"My heartbeat has stopped."

570
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:37,320
"My life is going on."

571
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:41,560
"My heartbeat has stopped."

572
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:46,000
"My life is going on."

573
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:51,000
"The palanquin of my memories."

574
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:54,040
"The happy days are here."

575
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:58,000
"O dear, you are my happiness."

576
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,520
"Trust me."

577
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,640
"My heartbeat has stopped."

578
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:09,320
"My life is going on."

579
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:30,880
"There were many faces around me."

580
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,080
"One was yours and one was mine."

581
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:39,280
"There were many faces around me."

582
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:43,360
"One was yours and one was mine."

583
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:47,760
"I wonder, what you've given me."

584
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,720
"I've got the whole world."

585
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:55,840
"My heartbeat has stopped."

586
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,280
"My life is going on."

587
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:26,000
"Words on my lips."

588
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:30,240
"Those are full of tunes."

589
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:34,440
"The tunes make a song."

590
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:38,720
"It praises about you."

591
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:43,120
"Get lost in the embrace of your dreams."

592
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:47,800
"Get drenched in the shower of memories."

593
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:53,800
"My heartbeat has stopped."

594
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:58,720
"My life is going on."

595
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:14,160
Give me some medication. I'm in great pain.

596
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:21,760
I've given you a sleeping pill. Quietly go to sleep.

597
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:26,000
I'm in great pain sister!

598
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,880
No, I can't give you more drugs.

599
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:36,040
Tell doctor I can't bear it.. - No, he won't give more drugs.

600
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,640
Shut up and go to sleep.

601
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:40,000
Why are you screaming? What's the problem?

602
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:43,840
A soldier lost his legs and doesn't even sigh and you.. Idiot!

603
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,000
Screams like a weakling in spite of being a soldier! Sorry, sister.

604
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:57,440
The valour and courage shown by our commandos in this brave venture..

605
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,440
.. has prompted the President to..

606
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,600
..announce the following medals. Major Chavan, Kirti Chakra.

607
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:04,160
Second Lieutenant, Peter D'Souza, Shaurya Chakra.

608
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:10,360
And a Shaurya Chakra for second Lieutenant Diganto after his death.

609
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,760
Now for the sports news.

610
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:17,160
In the Asian Games competition being conducted in New Delhi..

611
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,240
India didn't win any medals today too.

612
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,440
Hello. - We've done it.

613
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:42,120
The President has announced a Shaurya Chakra for you.

614
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,240
You deserved it sir.

615
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:02,680
There can be no award greater than this.

616
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,240
Good night. - Good night, sir.

617
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,440
Excuse me. Do you know where Peter D'souza is?

618
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:27,680
I'm John D'Souza.

619
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,080
He is my son.

620
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,040
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know..

621
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,320
..Lieutenant Peter..

622
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,880
..is leaving us due to medical reasons.

623
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:36,000
I wish him the best of luck..

624
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:40,480
..for his private life and on behalf of all of you..

625
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:44,400
..I request Lieutenant Peter to accept..

626
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:48,680
..a small memento from Maratha light inventory regimental staff.

627
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,560
Thank you, sir.

628
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:08,120
"He's a jolly good fellow."

629
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:12,000
"He's a jolly good fellow, so say all of us."

630
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:16,000
"So say all of us."

631
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:20,160
"He's a jolly good fellow."

632
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:24,000
"He's a jolly good fellow, so say all of us."

633
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:27,920
"So say all of us."

634
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,080
"He's a jolly good fellow."

635
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:35,840
"He's a jolly good fellow, so say all of us."

636
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:39,800
"So say all of us."

637
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:43,880
"He's a jolly good fellow."

638
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,120
"He's a jolly good fellow, so say all of us."

639
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,640
What had to happen has happened.

640
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:52,800
But I am glad that..

641
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,000
My son will now remain with me. Forever.

642
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,000
Shirley is getting married.

643
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:10,320
Unfortunately, to me.

644
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:15,000
I tried to explain to her to marry a complete man.

645
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:18,520
Of what use is a man who can't stand on his own feet?

646
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:22,320
I can't write her answer in this letter to you.

647
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,680
You have to come here to hear it.

648
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:28,600
You have to come. The wedding is next Saturday on the 25th.

649
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,160
This mission will be incomplete if you don't grace this occasion.

650
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,720
Your joker, Peter.

651
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:57,120
Do you want a hotel? - No.

652
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,280
First class hotel, sir.

653
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:00,920
You'll get an off season discount. - Don't want.

654
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,680
Sir, I'll forego my commission. - I don't want it.

655
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:06,720
Look at me just once.

656
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:10,000
Everything will be arranged.

657
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,800
Are you a man or.. - A pimp.

658
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:22,080
Stop here.

659
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,240
Who are you? Go away.

660
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:08,000
I'm Peter's friend.

661
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:13,320
I've come here for his marriage. - Peter is dead.

662
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:18,000
Jesus Christ..

663
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:23,440
..bring the body of our brother to be buried in its human impartment..

664
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:28,600
Pray with confidence to God who gives life to all things..

665
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,000
..that He'll raise up this mortal body to the perfection..

666
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:35,040
..and company of all sayings. Amen.

667
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,080
But why do you want to know?

668
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,240
What happened? How?

669
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,600
What will it change?

670
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:43,000
Will he return?

671
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:54,120
Peter is dead. He is gone.

672
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:04,280
You cut his legs and sent him to me.

673
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:08,640
Brain washed him.

674
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,080
He lost his life.

675
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,120
But Peter is here.

676
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:47,080
With me.

677
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,240
Try to understand him.

678
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:54,560
I can't write her answer in a letter.

679
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:58,320
You have to come here to hear it. That's why you must come.

680
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:30,120
There was a message for you from Peter.

681
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,160
Before dying he said..

682
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:47,800
What..?

683
01:33:56,680 --> 01:34:02,320
He said.. he didn't run away from the battle field.

684
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:10,760
he fought to his last breath.

685
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:16,760
He was killed in front of all.

686
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,080
Killed?

687
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:24,600
In front of everyone.

688
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Everyone watched the scene of his death.

689
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:30,280
Nobody came to his aid.

690
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:35,120
How did this happen?

691
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:41,520
Peter had an argument with Uncle last week.

692
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:45,400
Dad I've told you, I don't like this!

693
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:51,240
Have you given a trial for your clothes?

694
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:55,040
First you tell me, why did you pay them when I've told you not to?

695
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:05,640
You wanted a tie pin. Shirley, Vinnie knows it..

696
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,800
Don't change the topic! - You're stuck with nonsense!

697
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,640
You're getting married next week.

698
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:16,560
There's so much work.. - They will be done.

699
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,600
You said, we don't pay protection money anymore.

700
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:23,000
You lied. Why do we have to pay when we are decent shopkeepers?

701
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:27,560
I'm not the only one. Everybody pays.

702
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:33,640
They will come and vandal the place if we don't pay.

703
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:35,720
Try to understand, my son.

704
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:39,320
Who will be responsible for it?

705
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:42,440
How many men are they? 8? 10? 20?

706
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:45,080
And how many are we? Why don't we fight them?

707
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:51,160
Because we are decent people. It's not our job to fight.

708
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:56,320
We give them some money and buy time for us.

709
01:35:57,160 --> 01:36:02,280
After that I tried to explain to him.

710
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:06,000
But he paid no heed.

711
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:10,440
He said, he'd fight them.

712
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:15,920
He kept repeating it.

713
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,560
Soldier never quits till his death.

714
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:24,000
You taught him that?

715
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:28,120
Uncle was frightened.

716
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:38,080
He went to the gangster's den to give them the money.

717
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:42,240
Maybe he was too late.

718
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,400
The gangsters had left.

719
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:54,760
Peter was in the bakery..

720
01:36:57,480 --> 01:37:02,440
Outside the bakery.

721
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:07,080
When the hoodlums asked him about uncle..

722
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:13,240
He told them to go away if they had come for money.

723
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:17,400
No shop keeper will pay extortion from today.

724
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:01,600
You will pay protection money!

725
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:05,920
Will you pay? - No!

726
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:10,440
Say, will you pay? - No!

727
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:15,880
I'll show you!

728
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,800
Now say, will you pay up? - No!

729
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:36,000
Didn't the police do anything?

730
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:41,280
They did. A first hand report was filed.

731
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:50,920
The police did not get one eye witness of this murder.

732
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:56,920
Peter was killed in front of hundreds of people.

733
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,360
But they were decent.

734
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:05,800
They are accustomed to living in the shade of fear..

735
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,880
They are tied to each other with this string of fear.

736
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:17,560
They neither see evil nor hear any evil.

737
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:20,880
Neither speak evil.

738
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:32,800
Whom do you want?

739
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,600
Mr. Singh? - He's inside.

740
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:40,680
Hello. - Okay, sir.

741
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:43,920
Major Chavan. - Please.

742
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,400
What happened to the Peter murder case?

743
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,880
The case has been filed. - Why?

744
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:57,080
Because you need eye witnesses to prove the crime.

745
01:39:57,560 --> 01:40:00,600
Witness to the crime. - And you found none?

746
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:06,080
You may go. And don't worry.

747
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:11,040
If there was a witness, why would the case be filed?

748
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:13,560
He was killed in the presence of hundreds.

749
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:16,000
Really? - Everybody knows it.

750
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:20,520
Okay. Get 2 witnesses. I'll open the case again.

751
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:22,520
Come with me. I'll get you witness.

752
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:26,080
I've been there once. No point going again.

753
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:29,160
I'll have to go to your superior if you don't come.

754
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:34,640
You may waste your own time but he doesn't have time for petty issues.

755
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:40,160
You don't know the customs here. To clear your misunderstanding..

756
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:42,800
I'll come with you. Come on.

757
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:51,800
Don't do that.

758
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,880
Enough of it now. Come on.

759
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:06,760
Was Peter D'souza murdered here? Did you see anything?

760
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:09,160
No sir. I neither heard nor saw anything.

761
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:11,400
Where do you live? - Just here.

762
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,800
Know anything about this case? - I know nothing.

763
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:23,760
Yes, he lived there. But he died.

764
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,160
How? - I don't know.

765
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,560
We had gone to the airport. Her brother was coming from Dubai.

766
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:37,160
The customs people were troubling us.

767
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:39,400
We know nothing.

768
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:48,600
Hello, Mr. D'Souza. - Hello.

769
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:52,480
You are Peter's father. Any grouse against us?

770
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,600
No, none at all.

771
01:41:57,680 --> 01:42:02,560
No complaints. Ask anyone. You are the king, our God.

772
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,400
Did you hear that? You may still try.

773
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:10,000
The case can be opened at any time.

774
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:13,360
Goodbye, Major. Goodbye D'Souza.

775
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,400
You call it news? Hoodlums kill somebody and its' news?

776
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:23,840
In a city like Bombay, hundreds of people die like cats and dogs.

777
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:27,680
Is that called news? This is called news.

778
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:31,320
Peter was no ordinary man.

779
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:33,520
He's an army officer recipient of Shaurya chakra.

780
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:36,920
He risked his own life to save kids from terrorists.

781
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,680
Saved his brother officers. - That story was printed.

782
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:43,840
But what is it now?

783
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:51,120
Yes, speaking. The Home Minister caught a cold?

784
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:55,040
I'll print it. What? He's going to London?

785
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,800
I'll print that too.

786
01:42:57,880 --> 01:42:59,120
On the front page.

787
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:46,760
Are you leaving?

788
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:11,160
No need for thanks.

789
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:13,160
I keep paying guests.

790
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:17,480
Show him the room upstairs.

791
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:32,000
Switch on the light.

792
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:39,000
This room. Rent 600 rupees.

793
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:41,000
Two months advance. Come here.

794
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:47,400
This is the bathroom. Water comes for an hour.

795
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:48,640
Come here.

796
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:53,400
This is the stove. Make tea whenever you want.

797
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:55,160
I'll bring tea once.

798
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:59,840
This door is always kept shut. It was our bedroom when Papa was here.

799
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:04,320
This table fan. Switch it on whenever you want to.

800
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:06,120
Keep it on 3 or it will become hot.

801
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:10,800
Switch off the bulb at 11 or the neighbours will shout.

802
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:14,480
This is a table and a table lamp. Use it whenever you want.

803
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,000
It works. Whoever comes here has to tell me stories.

804
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:20,680
May I go? - You talk very well.

805
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:23,800
Only I talk. Mother never speaks.

806
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:27,080
And I take the rent. - What's your name?

807
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:28,600
Chandrakant Dodhar.

808
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:31,080
But people call me Chiku.

809
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:35,120
Mother says I'm as sweet as a chiku.

810
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:39,000
What's in this?

811
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,000
I'm going. Mother is calling me. She has to leave early.

812
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:47,080
Where? - Hospital. Mother is a nurse.

813
01:45:50,120 --> 01:45:52,680
Remember the story..? - Yes.

814
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:57,080
Wait for a minute.

815
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,640
Give this to mother. Advance.

816
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:26,720
Mother said she doesn't want an advance.

817
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:48,520
Why have you come back here?

818
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:51,440
Get out! Get out of here!

819
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:08,600
Do you want to know why I kept quiet in front of the police?

820
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:11,120
Peter's mother died after giving him birth.

821
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:16,040
I reared him. And now he's snatched away from me.

822
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:19,120
First I lived for him. Now I live with his grief.

823
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:27,680
I don't want any father to go through this pain.

824
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:33,040
As for the sorrow, that is there.

825
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:37,480
Tell me who is not unhappy. Look at Kiran.

826
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:43,000
She was pregnant. She had gone on a picnic with her husband.

827
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:45,040
Hoodlums teased them.

828
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:49,120
Her husband objected and was killed.

829
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:54,680
They beat her up so bad that her dream of motherhood remained a dream.

830
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:58,920
Chiku is not her son.

831
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:02,240
Some unfortunate soul died on giving him birth in the hospital.

832
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:04,400
She adopted him.

833
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:07,720
Nobody knows this. What?

834
01:49:08,120 --> 01:49:10,520
She's fighting alone.

835
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:13,000
Sorrows.

836
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:18,360
These army rules don't work here.

837
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:23,160
Peter never understood this. Neither will you.

838
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:29,000
Soldier never quits till his death.

839
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:34,400
Peter believed in this. What did he get?

840
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:37,640
One wheel chair and two yards of land in a graveyard.

841
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:41,760
Soldier never quits till his death.

842
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,720
Oh my.

843
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:07,320
Look there!

844
01:50:10,040 --> 01:50:15,000
Can you see mother? - Yes.

845
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:32,400
My wallet.. Major!

846
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:42,000
I'd got my pension. Somebody flicked my wallet.

847
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:45,160
How much? - Ten bucks.

848
01:50:47,640 --> 01:50:50,240
Please come home.

849
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:55,040
Come in. Sit down.

850
01:50:58,280 --> 01:51:00,720
Shirley, make some coffee for the Major.

851
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:06,720
Shirley is not home.

852
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:13,560
We never dreamed we'd see this kind of independence.

853
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:15,480
What happened today?

854
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:21,160
This freedom looted us. - The same thing again!

855
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,840
Freedom. Independence.

856
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,640
How long will you play it?

857
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:30,520
Change in your old age.

858
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:34,280
Shut up. You good for nothing.

859
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,040
There were other freedom fighters with him.

860
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,560
They are minting money, doing well.

861
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:03,520
And he kept chewing on honesty.

862
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:05,760
Does it fill your stomach?

863
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:10,000
Keep quiet. - How long will I keep quiet?

864
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:14,400
Go away! Vagabond!

865
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,400
I'm ashamed to call you my son!

866
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,800
Roams with hoodlums! Drinks! - What else do I do?

867
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:32,440
Listen to your lecture?

868
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,160
I was getting a good job in Dubai, would have earned in millions.

869
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:41,600
But you didn't have 5000 bucks.

870
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,600
When the heart burns, so will the tongue.

871
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:52,040
Now tell me what to do. - Shameless! Why don't you die?

872
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:54,800
Sits on his father's head!

873
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:57,640
I'll take you along if I drown.

874
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:05,440
Freedom fighter! Does anyone ruin their family for the country?

875
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:08,800
You are responsible for our ruin.

876
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:14,880
One who couldn't control his kids can't do anything for the country.

877
01:53:16,240 --> 01:53:19,400
What have you done? What did you achieve?

878
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:23,480
400 bucks a month as charity?

879
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:28,800
For that charity, you have to prove that you are alive.

880
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:39,360
Get lost, you stupid fool.

881
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:41,360
Go away. - Excuse me.

882
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,560
It would be better if you hadn't taken birth!

883
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:47,080
Who asked you to give me birth? Had I sent an application?

884
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:54,520
Come in.

885
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:05,720
Sit down.

886
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:40,680
Thanks a lot for punishing that loafer for whistling.

887
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:44,400
I didn't think you heard it.

888
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:54,720
I stopped hearing whistles after Chiku's father passed away.

889
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:02,560
Everybody wants a lonely widow.

890
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:14,080
Somebody whistles, somebody claps.

891
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:19,000
Somebody is sympathetic. Each man has his own style.

892
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:24,600
Yet I liked it a lot. Somebody answered the whistle.

893
01:55:26,360 --> 01:55:28,000
Thank you.

894
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:30,520
Thanks for the tea.

895
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:33,320
Hello. - Hi.

896
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:36,000
Sorry I have to study. Mother, I'm hungry.

897
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,120
He's very cute.

898
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:45,040
He's mine.

899
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:44,560
How are you? - Hello.

900
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:03,160
How long will the bakery be shut? - I'll start it soon.

901
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:05,040
How long will it be closed?

902
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:12,520
What's this money for? - Get lost.

903
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:17,520
What's this money for? - Get lost, you pimp!

904
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:50,640
He's the one who trained Peter! - Else Peter was so nice!

905
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:53,760
You'll leave tomorrow! - Then who will save us?

906
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:57,000
We have to live here! - Why is the army needed here?

907
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:10,800
Don't spare this man! - Hand him to the police!

908
01:58:11,120 --> 01:58:13,720
Beat him!

909
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:21,640
Major Chavan!

910
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,160
The local people have filed a report against you.

911
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:28,640
I can arrest you on charges of disrupting the peace in the area.

912
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,760
But I spare you with a warning because you're an army officer.

913
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,240
It would be better if we don't meet again.

914
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,480
Let me go across. I have to go to the hospital.

915
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,920
You can't go now. The Prime minister's convoy is passing by.

916
02:00:21,080 --> 02:00:24,640
My daughter isn't well. She's pregnant sir.. - Move behind!

917
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:33,560
Have mercy sir! - I'll lose my job then.

918
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:38,440
Don't be scared child. Why are you standing quietly?

919
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:41,000
Don't' be scared. Please let me go.

920
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:45,800
Sir! See the girl's state..

921
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:50,000
Let them go. They just have to go across.

922
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:53,400
Do your work. Let us do our duty.

923
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:57,360
Move the cyclist behind.

924
02:01:04,120 --> 02:01:08,080
What has happened! Lord!

925
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:15,280
Whose duty do you do? Who pays you your salary?

926
02:01:15,800 --> 02:01:17,760
Had this happened to your mother?

927
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:19,920
You'd be born on the road like this and would die!

928
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:22,840
Look at that! You are born and you've also died!

929
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:25,400
That dead child is you. And the screaming woman is your mother!

930
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:53,640
Why is the army needed here? - He's the one who trained Peter!

931
02:01:53,880 --> 02:01:56,800
You'll leave tomorrow. Then who will save us?

932
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:59,600
Beat him!

933
02:02:26,280 --> 02:02:31,000
Wants a lot to eat but won't beg for a penny!

934
02:02:34,160 --> 02:02:36,400
Worm!

935
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:16,400
Give me your watch.

936
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
What are you looking at? Give me your watch.

937
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:24,520
Go away. - I'll stab you! Come on!

938
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:43,880
Did you break it?

939
02:04:45,160 --> 02:04:48,400
Fix a new one. Each costs 15 bucks.

940
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:51,640
Okay. I'll fix it.

941
02:05:15,880 --> 02:05:17,800
Are you annoyed with me?

942
02:05:20,240 --> 02:05:23,400
To date you haven't told me a single story! What did I tell you?

943
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:25,160
I'll tell you one today.

944
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:31,840
Which story would you like to hear? - Of fairies!

945
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:37,160
Okay. A fairy tale.

946
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:42,080
Sit here.

947
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:46,400
What strength!

948
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:49,480
Strength lies in the brain not in the muscles.

949
02:05:49,720 --> 02:05:51,800
The fairy tale!

950
02:05:53,320 --> 02:05:54,920
Okay.

951
02:05:57,120 --> 02:06:02,440
There was a fairy. She had a small, tender prince.

952
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:04,640
Like you.

953
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:08,400
Both lived happily.

954
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
One day two devils came.

955
02:06:13,240 --> 02:06:15,080
And carried the fairy away.

956
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:20,680
The prince tried hard to save his mother.

957
02:06:21,880 --> 02:06:25,440
But he couldn't save her. Why?

958
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:28,880
Because he was small.

959
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:35,880
He sat there and cried. Then a sage passed that way.

960
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:40,400
He saw a little prince crying.

961
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:43,680
So he took him to his orphanage.

962
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:50,000
He learnt to read and write. And grew up there.

963
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:56,000
Then one day he left to look for his mother.

964
02:06:58,280 --> 02:07:05,240
"The wretched cuckoo is singing."

965
02:07:05,320 --> 02:07:11,840
"The wretched cuckoo is singing."

966
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:19,080
"She's making me feel jealous."

967
02:07:19,160 --> 02:07:22,040
"She's making me feel jealous."

968
02:07:22,120 --> 02:07:25,480
"It is giving rise to..

969
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:30,120
..desires in me."

970
02:07:32,440 --> 02:07:39,000
"I'm missing my beloved."

971
02:07:39,080 --> 02:07:45,000
"I'm missing my beloved."

972
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:52,000
"I'm missing my beloved."

973
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:56,800
"I'm missing my beloved."

974
02:07:58,240 --> 02:08:03,880
"I'm missing my beloved."

975
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:08,320
"I'm missing my beloved."

976
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:16,000
"I'm missing my beloved."

977
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:20,600
"I'm missing my beloved."

978
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:38,440
"I'm missing my beloved."

979
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:47,240
"I'm youthful, O Spring."

980
02:08:47,320 --> 02:08:55,040
"I'm youthful."

981
02:08:55,920 --> 02:09:03,360
"I'm youthful."

982
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:06,760
"O Spring."

983
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:11,840
"I'm getting older."

984
02:09:30,120 --> 02:09:32,560
I won't go!

985
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:37,520
Let me go! No! - Get in quietly!

986
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:41,000
Let me go! - Acting pricey!

987
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:45,000
I don't want to go! - Don't jump so much.

988
02:09:46,640 --> 02:09:49,520
Have we paid money for nothing?

989
02:09:51,800 --> 02:09:56,000
My baby! I won't go!

990
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,560
I don't solicit customers!

991
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:05,920
What are you watching? Get lost!

992
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:09,840
Let her go.

993
02:10:09,920 --> 02:10:12,000
What did you say?

994
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:06,360
Did the prince find his mother?

995
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:48,800
Have you started soliciting customers?

996
02:11:49,080 --> 02:11:52,000
Are we dead? - The nurse from our area..

997
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:55,320
.. nursing outsiders is not acceptable to us.

998
02:11:55,400 --> 02:11:58,080
Throw the man out.

999
02:11:58,160 --> 02:12:01,600
And you'll be booked by us for all your nights.

1000
02:12:02,120 --> 02:12:04,000
What advance do you want?

1001
02:12:04,080 --> 02:12:07,880
Let's see the grade of your stuff.

1002
02:12:10,240 --> 02:12:12,080
Come on, shunt him out!

1003
02:12:12,360 --> 02:12:15,000
What does he have that we don't?

1004
02:12:16,160 --> 02:12:18,400
Get him out!

1005
02:12:18,640 --> 02:12:22,640
Wearing bangles like a girl? Come out!

1006
02:13:36,760 --> 02:13:38,000
Come on, kill me.

1007
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:41,640
Kill me.

1008
02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:52,280
Come on, kill me.

1009
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:55,560
Kill me.

1010
02:20:36,040 --> 02:20:38,080
What did you think?

1011
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:41,240
You can do anything.

1012
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:48,400
You'll come here and throw stones into houses.

1013
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:51,000
Hurl abuses.

1014
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Trouble citizens.

1015
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,160
What can one weak woman do?

1016
02:21:03,640 --> 02:21:06,400
You know there's nobody here who can help her.

1017
02:21:10,360 --> 02:21:16,280
Because whenever you come, everybody hides behind their doors and windows.

1018
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:21,680
No finger is lifted.

1019
02:21:24,360 --> 02:21:26,400
No window is opened.

1020
02:21:29,680 --> 02:21:31,920
And so you can do anything.

1021
02:21:35,800 --> 02:21:40,360
Those who watch from behind the window are as guilty as you are.

1022
02:21:47,640 --> 02:21:49,880
Destroying you is very difficult.

1023
02:21:53,240 --> 02:21:55,400
You are in huge crowds.

1024
02:21:58,440 --> 02:22:00,280
Like insects.

1025
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:05,600
That doesn't mean I'll get tired and sit down.

1026
02:22:07,800 --> 02:22:12,000
As long as you continue with your work, I'll carry on with mine.

1027
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,760
Come on, get up. Kill me.

1028
02:22:20,840 --> 02:22:22,000
Kill me.

1029
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:37,360
We fought 3 wars on the country's borders in the past 43 years.

1030
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:41,600
And the time taken was 3 months.

1031
02:22:42,280 --> 02:22:45,880
We called the remaining 42 years and 9 months, peacetime.

1032
02:22:46,320 --> 02:22:48,320
Can we call this peace time?

1033
02:22:50,080 --> 02:22:52,920
In the army we are taught to save the country from the enemy.

1034
02:22:53,160 --> 02:22:57,640
To give our lives for it. We have some duties ad I've done my duty.

1035
02:22:58,760 --> 02:23:00,920
There should be some just reason to die.

1036
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:03,440
For us the reason is our country.

1037
02:23:04,560 --> 02:23:06,080
But what does country mean?

1038
02:23:06,520 --> 02:23:09,000
Roads buildings, houses, fields, farms, rivers..?

1039
02:23:09,080 --> 02:23:12,160
Is that it? And people.. where are they?

1040
02:23:12,680 --> 02:23:17,000
Whom do we save? At the front we know whom to shoot.

1041
02:23:17,680 --> 02:23:19,640
But here you have enemies all around.

1042
02:23:19,720 --> 02:23:21,440
An enemy is an enemy.

1043
02:23:22,480 --> 02:23:25,400
The only difference is one is across the border, one is here.

1044
02:23:26,160 --> 02:23:28,400
The enemy here is more dangerous.

1045
02:23:28,880 --> 02:23:30,640
They're eating away the country like termites.

1046
02:23:30,920 --> 02:23:32,680
Making it hollow.

1047
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:36,240
Isn't it our duty to fight this enemy?

1048
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:40,720
Fighting for our rights can never be wrong.

1049
02:23:41,160 --> 02:23:42,440
I'm a soldier.

1050
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:44,320
Soldier never quits till he is dead.

1051
02:23:44,400 --> 02:23:45,920
This is our motto.

1052
02:23:46,680 --> 02:23:49,320
What can I do if the battle field changes?

1053
02:23:50,240 --> 02:23:52,920
I think army training should be compulsory for everybody.

1054
02:23:53,400 --> 02:23:56,560
At least one year of your life should be given to the nation.

1055
02:23:57,400 --> 02:24:00,880
Today people have no value of independence because it's free.

1056
02:24:07,400 --> 02:24:11,160
Major Chavan has been disturbed mentally by the evils of society.

1057
02:24:11,440 --> 02:24:15,560
Due to this he forgot his duty and made the mistake of..

1058
02:24:15,640 --> 02:24:17,520
Trying to reform society.

1059
02:24:17,600 --> 02:24:21,600
That's the job of our leaders and administrators not the army.

1060
02:24:21,920 --> 02:24:27,600
The court advises that till the time these influences are erased..

1061
02:24:27,680 --> 02:24:31,360
Major Chavan will have to remain under psychiatric care.

1062
02:24:31,600 --> 02:24:35,000
In this period, his salary and seniority won't be affected.

1063
02:24:35,080 --> 02:24:38,240
Mentally unstable. They could have hanged me!

1064
02:24:38,720 --> 02:24:40,760
Am I insane, sir? - Come on, Chavan!

1065
02:24:41,160 --> 02:24:44,120
Why do you worry? Everything is fine now. Come on.

1066
02:24:52,120 --> 02:24:53,800
His room is upstairs.

1067
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:07,240
Uncle isn't there.

1068
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:13,840
Mother.. he's there.

1069
02:25:52,880 --> 02:25:57,000
I missed you so much.. Don't ask.

1070
02:25:57,160 --> 02:26:00,640
I will ask. Why didn't you come? I waited for so long!

1071
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,080
Nobody tells me any stories.

1072
02:26:03,320 --> 02:26:05,160
There's much on your hands.

1073
02:26:06,560 --> 02:26:08,280
Don't say that about earth.

1074
02:26:09,080 --> 02:26:11,080
Flowers grow in this mud.

1075
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:15,080
Someday there will be flowers all around over here.

1076
02:26:15,920 --> 02:26:18,360
The wind will be heavy with the aroma of flowers.

1077
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:24,400
Then butterflies will sit in the lap of flowers and hear tales from birds.

1078
02:26:25,120 --> 02:26:28,160
When will these people let you go? - I don't know.

1079
02:26:29,400 --> 02:26:32,640
But when I have lots of friends like you..

1080
02:26:34,320 --> 02:26:35,880
I will be free.

1081
02:27:03,320 --> 02:27:04,520
How are you?

1082
02:27:06,400 --> 02:27:08,080
How are you?

1083
02:27:08,280 --> 02:27:10,000
I am fine.

1084
02:27:28,880 --> 02:27:30,920
Uncle is not unwell.

1085
02:27:32,320 --> 02:27:35,560
Yes, he is not sick.

1086
02:27:37,800 --> 02:27:40,480
We'll wait for him.

1087
02:27:42,480 --> 02:27:43,680
Let's go.

1088
02:28:26,280 --> 02:28:27,760
Welcome Jokers.

1089
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:32,760
You've come here for training not for a picnic!

1090
02:28:36,280 --> 02:28:38,480
Move towards one side.

1091
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:40,920
Move towards one side.

1092
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:03,760
Come on, run!

1093
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:08,720
"No matter someone follows you or not, we have to reach there."

1094
02:29:08,800 --> 02:29:13,000
"No matter someone follows you or not,..

1095
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:18,040
..we have to reach there."

1096
02:29:18,120 --> 02:29:22,720
"We have to make new roads..

1097
02:29:22,800 --> 02:29:28,240
..for our younger generation to walk on."

1098
02:29:32,400 --> 02:29:37,000
"Take whoever comes with you."

1099
02:29:37,040 --> 02:29:42,240
"If nobody comes, then walk alone."

1100
02:29:44,120 --> 02:29:48,760
"The one who comes out of the darkness and shines..

1101
02:29:48,840 --> 02:29:53,640
..the world will recognize him."

1102
02:29:53,720 --> 02:29:58,400
"We have the stars in our fist."

1103
02:29:58,480 --> 02:30:03,080
"Whenever it opens, it will shine."

1104
02:30:03,160 --> 02:30:07,880
"The star that never breaks."

1105
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:13,000
"The whole world knows about it."

1106
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:17,560
"We have the stars in our fist."

1107
02:30:17,640 --> 02:30:22,520
"Whenever it opens, it will shine."
