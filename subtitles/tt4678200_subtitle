2
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,458
Couldn't it fly over someplace else?

3
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:58,041
It stopped the flow.

4
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,166
-Mann.
-Yes.

5
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,333
Don't you think it was very low?

6
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,500
Too many passengers, I think.

7
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:08,916
-Okay.
-It's flying low because of the overload.

8
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:10,916
That's why it's flying low.

9
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,125
Yes.

10
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,291
-Tell me something.
-Yes.

11
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,083
How many people can it carry?

12
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,958
I think, half of our village.

13
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,041
Half of the village?

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,958
Where does the excreta
of so many people go?

15
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,583
Do you know Honey from Mashiwade?

16
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,458
Oh, yes! Honey from Mashiwade.

17
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,500
-He told it to me once.
-What?

18
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:41,166
There is a hole below the airplane.

19
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,875
-A hole?
-Yes.

20
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:46,708
They keep doing it, up there,
and it keeps dropping on the surface.

21
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,083
They keep doing it, up there,
and it keeps dropping on surface?

22
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,541
I hope you aren't lying.

23
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,375
I am not a minister that I would lie.

24
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,166
It's not like that.

25
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,958
They keep doing it, up there,
and it keeps dropping down.

26
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:01,583
First, the airplane spoiled my mood
and now you are ruining it.

27
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:06,083
Forget it. Give me water.
I need to wash my hands.

28
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,458
-Give it to me.
-The water spilled.

29
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,666
Use a stone or something.

30
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,458
You can never take care of anything.

31
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,416
It wasn't a gem or jewelry.

32
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,958
You never do anything right.

33
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,458
You are always like this.

34
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:18,000
-Sir, we were just..
-The MLA is here.

35
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,916
-Move aside.
-Please, sir.

36
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,041
Answer our questions, sir.

37
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,583
Move aside. Move back!

38
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,791
-This way, please.
-How did this happen, sir?

39
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,750
-Move back.
-Please, sir.

40
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,666
-Please, sir.
-This way. Move back.

41
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,833
Answer our questions, sir. Please, sir.

42
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:35,833
That way, sir.

43
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,208
Answer our questions, sir. Please, sir.

44
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,750
-Scoundrel!
-Move back!

45
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:40,875
-You killed my Simran.
-Move back!

46
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,291
-You showed your true colors.
-Move back!

47
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,125
-I'll hit you with my baton.
-You scoundrel!

48
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,458
-Move back!
-What was her fault?

49
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,333
-You have killed your sister.
-What did you say?

50
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,416
-What did you say? Say it again!
-Why did you kill her?

51
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,166
<i>The MLA Harjeet Singh Mann's son</i>
<i>Garry Mann got into a fight</i>

52
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,416
<i>at the place where</i>
<i>his daughter's dead body was found.</i>

53
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,000
<i>Come, let's meet that innocent man</i>

54
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:10,875
<i>whose love was crushed</i>
<i>because of pride and ego.</i>

55
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:11,875
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

56
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,791
<i>He killed my Simran.</i>

57
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,333
<i>He killed Simran.</i>

58
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,125
<i>Garry killed his sister.</i>

59
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,166
<i>Because he is an MLA's son</i>

60
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,958
<i>and I belong to a middle-class family.</i>

61
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,750
<i>He couldn't tolerate our love.</i>

62
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:31,291
<i>Let me tell you something! He will kill me</i>

63
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,291
<i>just the way he killed his sister.</i>

64
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,000
<i>And all of you</i>
<i>will just watch him do that.</i>

65
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,416
How dare he revile me?

66
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,416
What have I done?

67
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,166
Shall I tell you
what you have done, you fool?

68
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,666
You ruined my reputation, you idiot!

69
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,208
What have I done?

70
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,041
You tell me what you have done,
you scoundrel!

71
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,083
-I didn't do anything.
-Shut up!

72
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:38,458
Shut up or I will kill you.
Despicable child.

73
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,500
-Darshan, get this straight.
-Yes, sir.

74
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:45,083
Come what may by tomorrow,
frame someone else in this case.

75
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,458
Keep this idiot out of it.

76
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:51,000
Do you understand?
Otherwise, I will lose my position.

77
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,833
Sir. Sir, relax.

78
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,708
Why do you need to worry when I am here?
I will handle it. Sir, please relax.

79
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,541
-Sharma.
-Yes, sir?

80
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,833
-Call up the CM's office.
-Okay.

81
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,791
And tell them that I want
only Advocate TS Brar for this case,

82
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,125
-and nobody else.
-Okay, sir.

83
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,208
Sir...

84
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:17,791
Who is he?

85
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,875
MLA's DAUGHTER MURDERED

86
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,375
Sonu?

87
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,500
My dear.

88
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,250
Get up, dear. Come here.

89
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,083
Get up and eat something.
Come on. That's enough.

90
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,083
-Mother, I...
-That's enough.

91
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,250
Get up. Stop crying.

92
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,333
That's enough. Stop crying.

93
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,708
-I don't want to eat.
-Please don't cry.

94
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,375
I'll go and answer the door.
Get up and eat.

95
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,541
Get up. Very good.

96
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,875
-Yes?
-Move aside.

97
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,541
-Whom do you wish to meet?
-Back off!

98
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,916
There is no one at home.
There is no one at home, I tell you.

99
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,833
Move.

100
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,041
I told you, there is no one at home.

101
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,125
-Don't touch me!
-Back off!

102
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,958
-Let go. Stay right here.
-There is no one at home.

103
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,458
-Back off.
-My son's not home.

104
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,833
-Don't you dare!
-Back off!

105
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,083
-Dare not enter my house!
-Look over there.

106
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,083
-Check inside!
-No one will go inside.

107
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,375
-I told you, stop it.
-You better back off.

108
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:33,041
-You are troubling a woman who is alone.
-Move aside.

109
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,000
Move aside, old woman.

110
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,166
-Check if someone is in there.
-Okay.

111
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,333
Hurry up.

112
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,541
There is no one inside. Hurry up.

113
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,166
I am hurrying up.

114
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,625
Yes. Keep it here. Hurry up and keep it.

115
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,041
Done. I am done.

116
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,125
-Move aside.
-No.

117
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,750
-Can't you hear me?
-You will have to go over my dead body.

118
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,958
-Move.
-Don't you dare! There is no one inside.

119
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,875
Move aside, old woman.

120
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:54,833
Let's go.

121
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,250
-Catch him.
-Come here, you hooligan.

122
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:01,458
-What have I done? Leave me.
-Come on.

123
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,541
-Listen to me.
-Don't take my son away.

124
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,833
-Let go of him.
-Let me go.

125
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:07,958
Stop troubling us, old woman.

126
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,500
-Listen to me.
-He didn't do anything.

127
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,916
I did nothing. Believe me.

128
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,541
Don't take my son away.

129
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,000
-Don't follow us.
-Leave him.

130
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,875
-Put him in the jeep.
-I didn't do anything. Mother!

131
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,875
They are taking my son away! Stop them!

132
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,250
-Put him inside.
-They are taking my son away.

133
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,541
I didn't do anything.
Why aren't you listening to me?

134
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,791
-Someone help him.
-I didn't do anything.

135
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,458
I really haven't done anything.

136
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,458
-Sonu...
-Sit down.

137
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,750
-Uncle!
-Inspector...

138
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,166
-Back off!
-Uncle!

139
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,041
-Sister-in-law... What happened?
-Sonu.

140
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,458
Judge! Hold on.

141
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,708
Judge! Listen to me, my dear.

142
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:55,500
Judge...

143
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:59,541
Stop acting childish. Open the door.

144
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,333
I am an idler, right?

145
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,208
What do you want from me now?

146
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:05,750
Should I open up an office?

147
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,916
Should I become an advocate
and plead before people?

148
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,625
I never said that you're an idler.

149
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,500
Why are you being angry with me?

150
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,750
It's just that your marriage proposal
was rejected. It's okay.

151
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:23,291
-Open the door.
-Leave me alone, Dad. Go away.

152
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,083
My dear... Judge!

153
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,583
Listen..

154
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,708
Listen to me, my child.

155
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:33,750
You are back?

156
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,875
My 15th marriage proposal was accepted.

157
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,583
Do you want me to celebrate the fact
that this was just my 7th?

158
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,000
Go away from here!

159
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,041
Are you sure, my dear?

160
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:53,666
Dad?

161
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:57,708
Dad!

162
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,208
-Sir!
-Dad!

163
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,083
Sir!

164
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,375
-Sir!
-Dad!

165
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,166
Finally, I caught it.

166
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,291
I had been chasing it for a while.

167
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,166
You were catching a rat?

168
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,458
I came running wondering
what happened to my father.

169
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:26,875
And you...

170
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:35,625
Dad, you know that every boy
of my age is married.

171
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,291
You know that, don't you?

172
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:43,416
There are just two boys left, Gora and me.

173
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:48,708
If Gora gets married before then...

174
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,583
No, my dear.

175
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,625
Don't talk nonsense.

176
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,958
Calm down and think about this.

177
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,583
Think about where you stand before Gora.

178
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,750
There is no comparison.

179
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,875
He won't get married before you.

180
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:07,583
Judge!

181
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,416
Judge!

182
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,250
Hurry up. Hurry up.

183
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:19,708
-Yes, Gora. What is it?
-Have some sweets.

184
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,250
I am getting married!

185
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:31,333

-Yes?

196
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,833
-Why didn't you get back to me?
-About the buffalo?

197
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,041
Darn you!

198
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,000
Not about the buffalo, about Judge.

199
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:19,625
-You had told me...
-What?

200
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,500
That you know a girl in your relations.

201
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:25,291
Oh, she got married. She is expecting now.

202
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,125
Then what are you waiting for?

Brother, my son has done an LLB.

211
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:56,750
Where does he practice?

212
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,125
He doesn't need to work.

213
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,291
By God's grace we have everything.

214
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,416
He is idle. He doesn't work.

215
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,458
I don't like this match.

216
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,333
-Consider it. Consider it!
-No.

217
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,333

224
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:29,750

Uncle?

244
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,500
Judge.

245
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,416
-Was this the place he asked us to come?
-Yes.

246
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:28,791
What?

247
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,833
Yes!

248
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,250
We were supposed to meet today, right?

249
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,166
He is here.

250
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,750
Dad, he is here.

251
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,750
-Yes.
-Manga,

252
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,458
we were supposed to meet
at twelve o'clock.

253
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,541
You wasted 15 minutes by coming late.

254
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,833
If they reach before us,
they will reject the proposal.

255
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,750
Uncle, how many times
have I told you not to worry?

256
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,875
I am here to take care of everything.

257
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,750
Why shouldn't we worry?

258
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,166
Girls have started addressing me as uncle.

259
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,375
That's what girls do.

260
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:14,000
To hide their own age,
they address men as uncle.

261
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,583
They even address me as uncle.

262
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,833
You're not even of his age!
Stop your nonsense.

263
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,166
Get this straight.

264
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:22,250
If things don't work out today,

265
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,125
then we will find
another matrimonial agent.

266
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,208
Yes.

267
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:32,958
Judge! My brother.
Why are you getting angry?

268
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,083
Do I have any other option?

269
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,458
This time it will be done.

270
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,500
This time I will get your marriage fixed.

271
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,541
-I guarantee it.
-Look who's talking!

272
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:48,125
-Today, let me put you through the test.
-Uncle, I assure you. It will be done.

273
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,916
Wow! You look great.

274
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,583
-Really? Is it good?
-Very good. You have a great smile.

275
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,583
Take a picture of me.
Take a picture of me, as well.

276
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,708
You care about taking pictures!
What if they have already left?

277
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,250
Call them up.

278
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,833
I will call them up.

279
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,666
You are strange.

280
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,916
-Dad.
-Yes?

281
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,000
-Mr. Amrik Singh?
-Isn't it good?

282
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,833
-You look so handsome.
-It's amazing, isn't it?

283
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:12,916
You look just like me.

284
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,416
This is exactly how I looked
when I was of your age.

285
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,916
They are here.

286
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:20,458
Hurry up.

287
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,000
Call me once you reach here.

288
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,500
-Hello.
-Hi.

289
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,750
-I seek your blessings.
-Hello...

290
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,166
It's not them.

291
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,416
Yes? Where have you reached?

292
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,500
At the crossroad?
Come soon. They are here.

293
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,250
You should have told us before.
Normally, you utter nonsense.

294
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,125
-Go and get them.
-Don't irritate me!

295
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,208
-I am the one who invited them.
-He is such a weirdo.

296
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:49,041
The father is more eager than the son.
He has driven me crazy.

297
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,750
Dad, I think they are here.

298
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,541
You shouldn't seek blessings
of every person you come across.

299
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,541
-You shouldn't be so eager, son.
-I will be there.

300
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,083
On time. Okay. Bye.

301
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,708
-Hello.
-This photo is also nice.

302
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,041
Uncle.

303
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:13,791
He is Mr. Amrik Singh.
And he is Mr. Lakhbir Singh.

304
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,166
That's his son Judge.

305
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,416
-Hello.
-Hi.

306
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,250
-I seek your blessings.
-God bless you.

307
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,750
-Hello. How are you?
-How are you?

308
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:22,666
Fine.

309
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,708
-Manga, why didn't you tell me?
-Dear! Come here.

310
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,458
You could have told us beforehand
that it was him.

311
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,250
-Hello.
-Hello.

312
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,750
-Hello.
-She's Kuljit.

313
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,375
And she is her mother.

314
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,916
-I seek your blessings.
-Be happy. God bless you.

315
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:13,958
-Lord Almighty.
-Lord Almighty.

316
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:17,166
-Lord Almighty.
-Lord Almighty.

317
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,416
<i>One hundred rupees!</i>
<i>He's putting 100 rupees!</i>

318
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,916
-Lord Almighty.
<i>-I have only 10 rupees.</i>

319
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:34,708
<i>One thousand rupees...</i>

320
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,291
I'll offer it.

321
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,791
<i>He didn't even see it.</i>

322
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:41,625
<i>Never mind.</i>

323
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,291
Lord Almighty.

324
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,208
Yes. It's the same guy
I was talking about.

325
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,416
His name is Judge.
But he doesn't even look like a driver.

326
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,708
Keep quiet.

327
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,208
He is so handsome.

328
00:19:56,958 --> 00:20:00,125
Judge, how did you like the girl?

329
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,791
I asked, how did you like the girl?
I will wrap this up quickly.

330
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,000
She is very beautiful, Father.

331
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,750
I suggest to take her home, today itself.

332
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,416
You can ask him,
if there's something you want to know.

333
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:26,458
Manga has told us everything, already.

334
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,416
You come from a nice family.

335
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,958
The boy has done an LLB.

336
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,916
But my dear, what do you do?

337
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:37,208
You just said it yourself.
I am a law graduate.

338
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,375
Being a law graduate is fine.
But what work do you do?

339
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:47,791
-Look, Mr. Amrik Singh...
-Yes?

340
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,833
Tell me, if the boy is a law graduate,
then what will he be?

341
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,000
-An advocate?
-That's right!

342
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,500
He is a very famous advocate.

343
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,625
He is well reputed
and known as murder specialist.

344
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:58,750
A murder specialist.

345
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,333
People queue
in front of his chamber with cases.

346
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,833
What kind of questions are you asking?

347
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,500
This becomes embarrassing.

348
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,875
They will think that
I didn't tell you anything.

349
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,666
No. This is not what I meant, Manga.

350
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,416
-Don't be angry.
-Come on.

351
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,458
I just wanted a reassurance.

352
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,916
You too can ask if you have any questions
for my daughter.

353
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,125
No. Everything is fine.

354
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,500
Children from decent family
can be recognized from a distance.

355
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,125
Sir.

356
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,833
-Your marriage is fixed?
-Yes.

357
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,583
Then what gift will you give me?

358
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:31,833
You?

359
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,666
I will buy you a phone.

360
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,291
A phone? Really?

361
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:41,083
We made a huge mistake today.

362
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,583
We shouldn't have consented
to Manga's lie.

363
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,875
Dad, you know nothing.

364
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,875
The marriage got fixed, didn't it?
Forget about it now.

365
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,625
Besides, your times were different.

366
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,666
This isn't considered a lie these days.

367
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:09,041
Look my dear,
we've never done anything wrong.

368
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,250
I didn't bring you up with such values.

369
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:15,208
-Dad, this...
-Answer a question of mine.

370
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,166
How many forests are there in this world?

371
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:21,125
How many elephants are there in them?

372
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,125
Millions, right?

373
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:29,333
My dear, an elephant eats food
weighing one quintal in a day.

374
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,416
Do you provide food to them? Or do I?

375
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:39,291
The God, who provides nourishment

376
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:43,625
to a parasite inside a stone,
shall also fulfill our needs.

377
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:47,291
But we tend to forget
that we are His children.

378
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:51,708
His children. We don't need to lie.

379
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,833
Yes. I am going to call them up.

380
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:57,791
I will call them.

381
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,208
Call them up, then!

382
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,458
Ruin your son's life.

383
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:03,916
Be happy.

384
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,958
Even the remote doesn't work here!

385
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:22,916
Today I have realized
that you don't want me to get married.

386
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,916
That is the truth.

387
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:28,541
Because of such things, I have turned 33.

388
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:32,041
Eventually, I will turn 50,
and yet be the same. Single.

389
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,083
I won't be married, even then.

390
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,708
But what difference does it make to you?

391
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:38,458
You can be honest, all your life.

392
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,666
What kind of a father are you?

393
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:43,208
Can't you lie a little for your son?

394
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,666
Call them up. Go on.

395
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,875
Call them up. Go on.

396
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:55,541
Why are you staring at me? Call them up.

397
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,458
Do you really like that girl a lot?

398
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:04,375
Yes?

399
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:09,041
Okay.

400
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:11,916
Fine.

401
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:16,416
Then Kuljit will be my daughter-in-law.

402
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,250
-Happy now?
-Yes.

403
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:32,750
Sonu is too much! He is so laid back.

404
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:36,958
He doesn't even keep
his discarded clothes together.

405
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,833
Once he sees Kuljit,
he forgets everything.

406
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:43,916
Aunt has told me everything.

407
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
She says my brother-in-law
is very handsome.

408
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:47,791
And that he is also
a very famous advocate.

409
00:24:47,916 --> 00:24:51,500
Have you ever seen him? He is too rustic.

410
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:52,666
Very rustic.

411
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,166
Don't talk rubbish.

412
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:58,041
Forget it. I know you are very happy.

413
00:24:58,125 --> 00:25:01,000
-Am I right? You are, aren't you?
-Sonu. There is no happiness.

414
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,125
Then what is it, joy?

415
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:07,000
Tell me something.
When will you introduce me to him?

416
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,291
I will think about that.

417
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,541
Your students are waiting for you.
Go and teach them.

418
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:12,791
You can meet your brother-in-law later.

419
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:14,916
Yes, I will teach them. That's my job.

420
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,833
-But I know, you are going to meet him.
-Yes.

421
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:33,375
<i>You ruined me as you took my heart away</i>

422
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:36,625
<i>You neither killed me nor kept me alive</i>

423
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:38,666
Hello.

424
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:41,958
Remember me? Judge Singh!

425
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:45,083
<i>You neither killed me nor kept me alive</i>

426
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:46,750
Get in. I will drop you off.

427
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,833
It's okay. I'll manage.

428
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:57,333
<i>She has attitude, she is worth the fight</i>

429
00:25:57,416 --> 00:25:59,375
<i>She is a beautiful lass</i>

430
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:00,833
<i>She has attitude</i>

431
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:02,875
<i>She is worth the fight</i>

432
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:04,708
<i>She is a beautiful lass</i>

433
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:06,625
<i>She is a beautiful lass</i>

434
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,500
Excuse me.
I wanted to go to the advocate's house.

435
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:11,333
No advocate stays here.

436
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:14,333
His name is Judge.

437
00:26:14,416 --> 00:26:15,500
-Judge? That's his house.
-Right there.

438
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:21,875
<i>She wears flowery dresses</i>
<i>She is delicate like a flower</i>

439
00:26:21,958 --> 00:26:25,083
<i>She gives her approval through her eyes</i>

440
00:26:27,708 --> 00:26:30,500
<i>She wears flowery dresses</i>
<i>She is delicate like a flower</i>

441
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:32,791
<i>She gives her approval through her eyes</i>

442
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,750
<i>One look at her gives an amazing high</i>

443
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:38,125
Hi. It's me!

444
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:46,041
<i>She has attitude, she is worth the fight</i>

445
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:47,958
<i>She is a beautiful lass</i>

446
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:51,708
<i>She has attitude, she is worth the fight</i>

447
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:52,875
<i>She is a beautiful lass</i>

448
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:54,208
Hi.

449
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,125
Hello? Where are you?

450
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,833
I have been waiting for you.

451
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,750
There is something fishy about that boy.

452
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,166
Stop it.

453
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:41,416
We have found a nice boy
with great difficulty.

454
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,416
And you are finding faults in him.

455
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:47,125
She has gotten out of hand
since she moved to the city.

456
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:49,750
I suggest we get her married quickly.

457
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:51,708
How can I just get her married?

458
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:53,916
I want her to get married.
I don't wish to throw her in a well.

459
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,583
-Just hear me out.
-Keep quiet.

460
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,750
Tomorrow, I will go to court.
I will go and see what the boy does.

461
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:03,125
Yes. Okay.

462
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:07,208
Yes. It's fixed on the fourth.

463
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:10,000
What are you saying?

464
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:12,916
I will come with a box of sweets
and the invitation card.

465
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:16,666
All right. Bring your entire family along.

466
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:19,291
Sure. Bye.

467
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:20,583
Judge!

468
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:22,625
Judge, you haven't taken a bath yet?

469
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,333
We have to go distribute
the wedding invites.

470
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,916
Dad, my underwear was kept here.

471
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:29,541
Your underwear?

472
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,458
Is this the one?

473
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,333
You took my underwear!

474
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:37,291
It's okay.
I will remove it and give it back to you.

475
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:39,708
-Let it be. I don't want it.
-Hey.

476
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,375
Why? Because it's used?

477
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:45,125
Dad's phone call.

478
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:47,541
-Dad? Who?
-My father-in-law.

479
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,708
Put it on speaker.

480
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:53,500
-Hello, Dad.
<i>-Hi, my dear. Where are you?</i>

481
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:54,958
I'm at home, Dad.

482
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:57,375
<i>At home?</i>
<i>Don't you have to go to court today?</i>

483
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:59,541
-Court?
<i>-The courthouse?</i>

484
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:02,333
The courthouse.

485
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:07,250
Yes, Dad. I was getting ready to go there.

486
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:10,958
<i>I am going to the court, today.</i>
<i>I will meet you in your chamber.</i>

487
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,750
-You are coming to court!
<i>-Yes.</i>

488
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:16,333
What now?

489
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,750
Dad.

490
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:23,083
JUDGE CALLING

491
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:29,000
Judge, I am in the court.
I will call you later. Okay?

492
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:33,583
People keep bothering me.
They keep calling, unnecessarily.

493
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:36,958
-Go ahead, ma'am.
-Dear, I think

494
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,375
I should divorce Kasturilal

495
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:41,041
and I should apologize, as well.

496
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:42,375
Apologize?

497
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:45,958
Ma'am, he should be apologizing,
and not you.

498
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,291
When will he apologize?

499
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:51,375
I know you since I was a child.

500
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,958
You used to consult my father
for this case.

501
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:58,166
And now, I am an advocate.
But you are still fighting that very case.

502
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:06,625
Look at my father's photograph.

503
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,875
You know, it was his dream

504
00:30:13,166 --> 00:30:14,708
to bring you justice.

505
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:18,166
And now, when we are close to victory,
you want to surrender!

506
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,458
That means 30 years
of hard work will go waste.

507
00:30:20,791 --> 00:30:23,166
Ma'am, recall the days of your youth.

508
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:26,291
When you used to attend a marriage
or a function,

509
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:28,750
people used to ask you
where your husband is.

510
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:31,083
-Were you able to answer them?
-No.

511
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:34,250
Oh, no.

512
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:41,041
Ma'am, look how your laughter,

513
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:44,500
your happiness, your smile

514
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:46,375
has fallen down.

515
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:48,583
But don't you worry.

516
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:50,708
I will bring them back to you.

517
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:52,500
Open your mouth.

518
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:57,708
-God bless you, my dear.
-All right?

519
00:30:59,541 --> 00:31:04,083
And I will surely bring you justice
in this hearing.

520
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:05,916
Understood? So, don't you give up.

521
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:27,583
Hey. Watch where you are going.

522
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:29,125
Hello?

523
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:31,916
-Hello.
-Yes? Hello?

524
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,750
Judge, what is your chamber number?

525
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:36,875
-Dad, I cannot hear you.
-Are you blind? Can't you see?

526
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:39,541
I asked, what your chamber number is.

527
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:41,666
-Hello?
-Hello.

528
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,250
What's wrong? Can't you hear me?

529
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:45,708
-Hello?
-Hello?

530
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:48,541
<i>-Judge. Hello?</i>
-Yes, Dad.

531
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:51,291
-Now I can hear you clearly.
-What is your chamber number?

532
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:54,708
My chamber number is 302.

533
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:56,208
It's 302.

534
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:58,375
I am coming to meet you.

535
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,750
-Sure, Dad.
-The thing is...

536
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:05,666
-Ma'am, your case is over.
-Alright, Son.

537
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,041
-Okay? You can leave now.
-Hey you! Hey! Judge.

538
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:09,291
What are you doing, Judge?

539
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:12,458
I had to take money from her.
What is going on?

540
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:13,958
You kept it here, again?

541
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:15,541
-Keep it in the drawer.
-Okay.

542
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:16,833
And undress.

543
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:19,875
Have you lost your mind?
What are you saying? What are you doing?

544
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:21,666
-Stupid fellow.
-Undress.

545
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,750
You closed the door of my chamber
and started stripping?

546
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:25,208
-Stop it.
-What are you doing?

547
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:26,208
Why are you stopping me?

548
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:27,416
-Remove your clothes.
-I am not into this.

549
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,291
Yes. Okay.

550
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:33,708
-Excuse me, Counselor.
-Yes, sir?

551
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:36,666
-Where is chamber number 302?
-Chamber number 302 is upstairs.

552
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,833
-Upstairs?
-Yes, upstairs.

553
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:39,125
Thank you.

554
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:46,333
Why are you asking me to undress?
At least tell me what's going on!

555
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:48,791
Look, my marriage got fixed
with great difficulties.

556
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:51,000
-Yes.
-My father-in-law has come to the court.

557
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:53,125
-Okay.
-Manga has told him that I am an advocate.

558
00:32:53,416 --> 00:32:55,041
-Yes.
-If my father-in-law finds out

559
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:56,083
-Yes.
-that I don't have a chamber here,

560
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,625
then he will call off the wedding.
I need your clothes, please.

561
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:16,916
Judge, let him come. Don't worry.

562
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,916
-I will talk to him. Sit down.
-You don't understand.

563
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:25,333
Dad.

564
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:28,375
-Hello, Dad.
-Hello.

565
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:29,791
-I seek your blessings.
-God bless you.

566
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,458
I hope you didn't have any trouble
finding the place.

567
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,541
No. I found it, quite easily.

568
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:43,625
The paint? I got it done recently.
It's newly painted.

569
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:46,500
No, my dear.
I am not talking about the paint.

570
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:48,375
This photo?

571
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,375
-My guru. He's my guru.
-Oh, your guru?

572
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:54,666
Come, have a seat. Have a seat.

573
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,291
Son, don't you have to wear
a white turban in the court?

574
00:33:57,375 --> 00:33:58,666
You are wearing a yellow one.

575
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,416
Pardon me?

576
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:02,416
You are wearing a yellow turban.

577
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,541
-My turban?
-Yes.

578
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:09,875
Even courts allow a little fashion,
these days. Have a seat. Sit down.

579
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,208
-Vijay Soni!
-What?

580
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:14,541
Vijay Soni.

581
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:17,208
-Hello.
-Hi.

582
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:20,958
Vijay Soni. I am fighting his case.

583
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,375
Yes.

584
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,291
Mr. Soni, he is fighting your case?

585
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:26,333
Yes sir, he is fighting.

586
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:27,666
Now what do I tell you?

587
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,583
I've managed to get a meeting
with him after six months.

588
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:31,625
He doesn't have any time to spare.

589
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,083
Good. Good. Very good.

590
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:37,583
So you are satisfied with his work?

591
00:34:37,666 --> 00:34:40,166
Satisfied? What do I tell you?

592
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,041
I never praise anyone in their presence.

593
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,458
But you won't find...

594
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:46,250
a better murder case specialist

595
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:48,541
-in this court.
-Wonderful!

596
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:53,583
He is a very famous advocate.
A murder specialist.

597
00:34:54,416 --> 00:34:57,916
I went to his chamber. I met him.

598
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:01,041
Yes. I was wrong.

599
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:02,958
I was suspecting him for no reason.

600
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:06,416
After all, it concerns my daughter.
One is bound to be concerned.

601
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:11,250
Yes... Hold on.
Hold on. I will call you back.

602
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:13,166
Okay. Hold on.

603
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,833
They are taking my son.

604
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:30,625
-I have not done anything.
-Let him go.

605
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:35,125
-What happened, Sonu?
-They are taking my son.

606
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:36,958
-Sir...
-Back off!

607
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:38,625
-Uncle!
-What will I do now?

608
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:44,166
My son. My Sonu.

609
00:35:48,458 --> 00:35:49,541
It stinks.

610
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,916
Judge, when was the last time
you took a bath?

611
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:54,416
-Why?
-You really don't know?

612
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,666
Even someone in the next city will know
that I am wearing your coat.

613
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:58,041
That's how much it stinks.

614
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:00,541
Hey!

615
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,833
Why are you stuffing this inside?

616
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:04,333
Do you know what this is?

617
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:07,041
-It's just a pen.
-Just a pen, you say?

618
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:09,083
You shouldn't touch the things
you don't know about.

619
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:11,333
This isn't a pen. It's a spy-cam.

620
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:13,208
Look over here. Here's the camera.

621
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:16,416
You are getting a call. Answer it.

622
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,833
He doesn't know anything
and yet he keeps fidgeting.

623
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:20,750
-Yes, Dad?
-Judge?

624
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:23,125
Quickly get to the police station.

625
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:26,500
-Police station?
<i>-Yes, the police station.</i>

626
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:28,583
Is everything alright?
Get to the police station.

627
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:29,625
-I will tell you what happened.
<i>-Okay, Daddy.</i>

628
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:31,708
-Sonu, give me your clothes.
-Again?

629
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:42,000
-I have not done anything.
-I will make you confess what you did.

630
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:47,916
Sir.

631
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:51,833
-What?
-We can hear his screams outside.

632
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:54,041
His mother is here.

633
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:59,000
-His mother is here?
-Yes, sir.

634
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:03,416
Okay, so your mother is here.

635
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:06,375
The constable will tell your mother

636
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:09,541
-that he has stopped the SHO.
-That's right.

637
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,916
With that assurance,
that poor woman will go back home.

638
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,875
But what will happen to you
after she leaves?

639
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:22,833
I have stopped the SHO at your behest.

640
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:24,291
You may leave now.

641
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:30,000
Fine! You do your job.

642
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:34,666
I won't leave
until you send my son with me.

643
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:36,916
Listen to me, ma'am.

644
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:39,916
It isn't that easy to get him released.

645
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,291
He has been arrested under section 302.
He won't even get bail.

646
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:46,666
First, his papers will be submitted.
Then he will be charged.

647
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,083
Then after six months or a year,

648
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,875
the hearing of his case will begin.

649
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:52,583
He will be locked up until then.

650
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:55,625
By then, you will beat him to...

651
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:59,958
Look, I beg of you.

652
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:01,833
For God's sake!

653
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:06,166
Let him go. Let my son go! Release him.

654
00:38:06,958 --> 00:38:09,250
I cannot release him, ma'am.

655
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:11,916
Neither can anyone else
in this precinct release him.

656
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:16,250
Now, only a good advocate can save him.

657
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:28,250
Listen to me.

658
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,958
Hire an advocate
and get his remand time ended

659
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:35,291
and get him sent to judicial custody.

660
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:37,125
Judicial custody?

661
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:39,375
Yes, in judicial custody.

662
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:42,916
I mean, get him out of the lock-up
and send him to jail.

663
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:45,125
That will save him from the thrashing.

664
00:38:46,416 --> 00:38:50,250
Another thing.
Don't tell anyone that I suggested this.

665
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:52,791
-We are pressurized by the top management.
-All right.

666
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:54,458
Dad?

667
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,458
-What happened?
-Judge.

668
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:57,958
Thank God you are here.

669
00:38:58,166 --> 00:38:59,708
-Do you know Sonu?
-Yes.

670
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:00,833
-Kuljit's aunt's son.
-Yes.

671
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:02,625
The police have arrested him.

672
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:05,875
Really? Dad, you don't worry.

673
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:08,708
Sit down. I will talk to them. Sit down.

674
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:11,000
Constable, have you arrested Sonu?

675
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:15,291
Don't you know what a nice boy he is?

676
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:17,375
Tell me, what has he done?

677
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:20,375
-Has he teased a girl?
-No.

678
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,875
No? He can never do that.

679
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,458
I know that. He is a very decent boy.

680
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:28,541
He must have gotten into a fight
with someone.

681
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,125
No, Counselor.

682
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:32,958
Then did he buy a movie ticket
from a black marketer?

683
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:35,000
No!

684
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:39,250
I got it.

685
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:41,750
Now I know what makes you tick.

686
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,083
Do one thing. Come here, please.

687
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:48,208
Come here...

688
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,875
Take this. Here you go.

689
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,166
Please don't ask for more.

690
00:39:56,666 --> 00:39:59,666
Counselor, were you not made aware?

691
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:03,708
-It's under 302...
-No matter what section it is,

692
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:06,708
let me tell you that I am an advocate.

693
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,625
You all will regret this
once I drag you all to the court.

694
00:40:08,916 --> 00:40:11,250
Counselor,
you will have to go to court, anyway.

695
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,375
He is being charged under section 302.

696
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:16,458
-Section 302?
-Yes.

697
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:21,000
-You mean murder?
-Yes.

698
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:23,958
Soni, I might have a heart attack.

699
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:26,875
I think Manga has decided
the day of my death.

700
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,500
How can I possibly get him
judicial custody?

701
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:31,375
-Now what will I do?
-You have done the LLB, haven't you?

702
00:40:31,791 --> 00:40:34,666
You know how I have managed to do that.

703
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:37,958
And that was eight years ago.
How can I fight this case?

704
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,500
It's not a big deal.

705
00:40:40,041 --> 00:40:42,750
Every advocate has to fight his first case
to begin practice.

706
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,708
Do this. Go home and read CLPC.

707
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:48,000
If you face any problem, call me.

708
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:50,375
But I have never stepped into a court.

709
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:51,666
Do you want to see a courtroom?

710
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:19,666
We will get you a divorce today.

711
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,375
-Hello, sir.
-The divorce must be done, today.

712
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:23,083
Oh ma'am,

713
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:24,333
you are back.

714
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:25,500
-You too, sir?
-Hello.

715
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:27,583
How many times have I told you
that frequent visits to court

716
00:41:27,666 --> 00:41:29,791
is just a waste of time and money.

717
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:30,750
Exactly, Your Honor.

718
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:32,958
That's what I told her.
But she just doesn't understand.

719
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:34,000
Isn't that right, ma'am?

720
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:35,708
That's enough.

721
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:37,291
So, as I was saying...

722
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:40,000
So... I was saying,

723
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:40,916
it has been 30 years.

724
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:45,208
-Please continue.
-Your Honor,

725
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:47,250
I was saying that it has been 30 years...

726
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:49,166
-Yes?
-Sneeze first.

727
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,833
It's okay. I will continue after that.

728
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:54,166
-What is this?
-Yes. Yes, please.

729
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:57,750
Your Honor, please wipe over there.

730
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:00,375
Continue.

731
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,916
Your Honor, as I was saying,
it has been 30 years...

732
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,208
You! Why are you standing there?

733
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:07,333
Either go outside or take a seat.

734
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:11,208
Proceed.

735
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,541
This case has been going on
for the past 30 years.

736
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:16,625
If they want to do it with mutual consent,
then why involve the court?

737
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:18,208
This is what I am saying, Your Honor.

738
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:21,625
We have come here for a divorce,
not to buy vegetables.

739
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:24,750
Get them divorced
and all the issues will be resolved.

740
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:26,208
How can they get divorced?

741
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:27,791
-Why?
-Sir, we are in India.

742
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:30,000
We live in a society

743
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:33,458
that raises questions when a brother
and sister are out together.

744
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:35,083
But I object, Your Honor.

745
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:36,291
Objection? What objection?

746
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:38,916
Mr. Kasturilal can find
another woman for himself.

747
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,500
How will Mrs. Bimla Rani
find another man for herself?

748
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,750
So please,
they shouldn't be divorced, sir.

749
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:47,000
You guys just don't understand.

750
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:49,833
I am giving you another chance.
Think about what I said.

751
00:42:49,916 --> 00:42:51,333
I am giving you another date.

752
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:54,416
-Next, please.
-He has given another date, yet again.

753
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,041
-What is this?
-Don't worry.

754
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:05,166
You don't have to worry about anything.

755
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,750
Thank God that old lady
didn't say anything in the court.

756
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:09,416
Otherwise, I would be in trouble.

757
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,416
I have bought my scooter on installments.

758
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,083
We won't let them get divorced

759
00:43:13,541 --> 00:43:15,125
-till all the installments are paid.
-True.

760
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:17,250
You are thinking only about yourself.
I will go crazy.

761
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:19,208
Tell me what I need to do
in the court in the morning.

762
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:22,250
-Why are you so nervous, Judge?
-What else do I do?

763
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,083
-I have a case in the morning.
-Wait a minute.

764
00:43:25,625 --> 00:43:26,458
Okay.

765
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:29,458
I will give you a mantra
which solves everything.

766
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:32,125
No one will tell you about this.

767
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:34,583
-No one but your friend.
-Thank you.

768
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:37,291
In the courtroom,
if you think you are stuck

769
00:43:37,875 --> 00:43:39,083
and you don't have a reply to give them,

770
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,833
then just be a nice boy and say one thing.

771
00:43:42,416 --> 00:43:45,125
This has nothing to do with our case.

772
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,750
That's it. Come what may.

773
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:24,291
Sir, your handkerchief.

774
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:27,500
-Call me later.
-Sir, your handkerchief.

775
00:44:30,916 --> 00:44:31,750
Mister,

776
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,583
T.S. Brar doesn't pick up anything
that has fallen down

777
00:44:35,666 --> 00:44:37,041
other than a fallen case.

778
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:40,250
Sir, may I keep it as your blessing?

779
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:55,083
Who is he?

780
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:57,250
He is someone who can have
the most powerful person arrested.

781
00:44:58,666 --> 00:45:01,833
T.S. Brar,
the top-most counselor in Punjab.

782
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:04,291
To see him is like seeing God.

783
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,250
Listen, what is Brar doing here, today?

784
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:10,958
-You know the MLA's daughter's case?
-Yes.

785
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,375
He is representing the state.

786
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:16,375
This means I am fighting against Brar?

787
00:45:16,791 --> 00:45:19,208
-He is?
-Yes. Best of luck.

788
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:45,333
Who was that gentleman with you,
back then?

789
00:45:45,416 --> 00:45:47,375
Who? Oh, that guy?

790
00:45:47,458 --> 00:45:48,833
He is my friend. Why do you ask?

791
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:50,875
Have you lost your mind?

792
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,750
-Why?
-It's the MLA's case.

793
00:45:55,416 --> 00:45:59,166
To stand against him means press, media

794
00:46:00,166 --> 00:46:02,291
and everyone else
will be witnessing this case.

795
00:46:03,166 --> 00:46:07,125
You keep running after small cases
for a few thousand rupees.

796
00:46:07,583 --> 00:46:10,833
This single case
can make you a millionaire.

797
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:12,750
Understood?

798
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:15,125
By the way, is he very close to you?

799
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,541
No. He is not that close to me.

800
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:21,583
Then what are you waiting for? Go for it.

801
00:47:04,208 --> 00:47:06,333
Lord Almighty.

802
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:09,541
My dear, you didn't sleep the whole night.

803
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:12,333
It's seven o'clock in the morning.
Stop working on it now.

804
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:14,541
-It's seven o'clock!
-Yes.

805
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:31,958
Move.

806
00:47:37,708 --> 00:47:38,708
Come here.

807
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,083
Yes, sir?

808
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,250
-Who are they?
-I don't know, sir.

809
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:46,208
Before I come in, can't you keep an eye...

810
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:47,958
on what's happening around?

811
00:47:48,541 --> 00:47:49,750
Why is he sleeping over here?

812
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:52,166
Let it be, sir. Is there a problem?

813
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:54,958
Why are you yelling at the kid?

814
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:57,000
And who are you?

815
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,583
I don't know him.

816
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:02,916
I am just saying,
it's early in the morning.

817
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,791
Don't ruin your mood. Keep calm.

818
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:07,875
I asked you who you are!

819
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:10,583
I am the advocate's father.
Now how can I help you?

820
00:48:10,666 --> 00:48:12,000
Do you think you have come
to attend a wedding?

821
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:15,125
This isn't a marriage palace.
This is a courtroom!

822
00:48:15,916 --> 00:48:17,750
Get up. Get up and sit over there.

823
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:20,125
Dad, you don't know him.
He is a well-reputed advocate, Mr. Brar.

824
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:22,916
So what if he is a famous advocate?
He cannot eat me up, can he?

825
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,833
I will get you arrested. You can ask him.

826
00:48:24,916 --> 00:48:26,666
-Ask him who I am.
-Yes.

827
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:28,625
-Why don't you understand, Dad?
-He is unnecessarily arguing

828
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:31,666
-early in the morning to ruin the mood.
-Sorry, sir.

829
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:34,875
Lad, where have you studied law?

830
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:37,125
At college.

831
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:41,375
College? You don't know
that the defense sits there and not here!

832
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:43,291
-Go there!
-Sorry, sir.

833
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:45,833
-Go and sit over there.
-Sorry...

834
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:47,708
Sorry, he says!

835
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:49,750
He thinks wearing a black coat
makes him a lawyer.

836
00:48:50,375 --> 00:48:53,708
Sister-in-law...

837
00:48:53,791 --> 00:48:54,625
Dear,

838
00:48:55,541 --> 00:48:57,416
-take care of your aunt.
-Okay.

839
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,541
I will be back in a moment.
Sister-in-law, I will be right back.

840
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:00,833
-Okay.
-Don't worry.

841
00:49:30,541 --> 00:49:31,375
You?

842
00:49:32,041 --> 00:49:33,958
-Hello.
-Hi.

843
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:44,750
Who is sleeping over here?

844
00:49:45,041 --> 00:49:47,208
Who is he? Wake him up.

845
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,291
-Sorry, madam.
-You can sleep if you want.

846
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:53,541
We can have the hearing outside today.

847
00:50:06,666 --> 00:50:08,625
-Me?
-Yes, you.

848
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:13,250
Yes, ma'am?

849
00:50:14,708 --> 00:50:15,791
Are you an advocate?

850
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:17,541
Yes, madam.

851
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:20,250
And you don't know how to tie a tie?

852
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:22,833
-Sorry, madam.
-Ridiculous!

853
00:50:23,666 --> 00:50:26,041
-You are an advocate?
-Yes, I am.

854
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:28,458
I thought you are Judge's client.

855
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:32,000
Client? You took that joke seriously
from the other day?

856
00:50:32,791 --> 00:50:35,791
-Joke?
-Yes, Judge was just messing with you.

857
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:38,625
-You really don't know about it?
-No.

858
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:40,000
Seriously?

859
00:50:41,666 --> 00:50:43,166
Wait a minute.
I will call him up, right away.

860
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:45,750
He's too much.

861
00:50:46,541 --> 00:50:48,833
Okay, tell me what your case is.

862
00:50:48,916 --> 00:50:51,375
Madam, my client...

863
00:50:53,875 --> 00:50:55,166
Whose phone is ringing?

864
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,625
Whose phone is it? Whose phone is it?

865
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:02,166
So, it's your phone.
Take it out. You sleep in the court.

866
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:05,500
It's because you are having
sleepless nights. Put it on speaker.

867
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:08,666
Let me see
who is giving you sleepless nights.

868
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:11,833
<i>Judge, did you see the real judge?</i>

869
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,791
<i>You had said that you wouldn't give</i>
<i>the judge a chance to speak.</i>

870
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:17,708
Sorry.

871
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:19,791
<i>I think the judge will eat you up.</i>

872
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:22,583
He hung up. Perhaps he is busy.

873
00:51:23,208 --> 00:51:24,375
It's his first case, after all.

874
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:27,041
-First case?
-Didn't you know?

875
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:46,333
Okay, so your name is Judge?

876
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:50,375
Yes, madam. I am a law graduate.
My name is Judge.

877
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:53,375
-Great. That's wonderful.
-Your Honor.

878
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:58,333
I am getting late.
I have other appointments to attend.

879
00:51:58,833 --> 00:51:59,666
Please speed up.

880
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,958
Fine, Mr. Judge Singh,
tell us what your case is.

881
00:52:03,416 --> 00:52:05,833
Madam, my client didn't do anything.

882
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:07,833
The police arrested him for no reason.

883
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,041
I have applied for his bail.

884
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,083
Mr. Judge, that's not how you say it.

885
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:14,000
What do you mean?

886
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:17,250
Not you, I was talking to him.

887
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:19,666
The new counselor.

888
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:21,625
Chap...

889
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:25,250
You should say "application for bail."

890
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:27,541
I wonder how he got to this point.

891
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:29,583
His license should be seized.

892
00:52:29,916 --> 00:52:32,333
You are right, Mr. Brar.

893
00:52:32,541 --> 00:52:34,583
Just imagine how we tolerate
such people, every day.

894
00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:38,416
It gives us a headache.

895
00:52:40,208 --> 00:52:41,291
Give it to me.

896
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:48,166
What is this?

897
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:50,916
You applied for an anticipatory bail?

898
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,125
Your client has already been arrested.

899
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:55,083
Yes, madam. That's right.

900
00:52:56,666 --> 00:52:57,708
Hey mister,

901
00:52:58,083 --> 00:53:00,708
you can apply for an anticipatory bail

902
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:03,125
only if your client has not been arrested.

903
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:07,458
You should now apply for a regular bail.

904
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:13,208
Madam, this has nothing to do
with our case.

905
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:17,916
What?

906
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:19,458
It has nothing to do with the case!

907
00:53:20,041 --> 00:53:21,125
-Mr. Brar.
-Idiot!

908
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:25,083
Forget about him.
You tell me, what is the case?

909
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:28,333
Ma'am, he is the prime suspect

910
00:53:28,416 --> 00:53:30,958
in MLA Harjeet Singh's
daughter's murder case.

911
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,416
Hold on, sir. Hold your tater!

912
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,375
Hold your horses.

913
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:36,166
My client's name
isn't mentioned in the F.I.R.

914
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:39,125
What do you mean by "hold your tater"?

915
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:41,333
Mind your language, Mr. Judge.

916
00:53:41,458 --> 00:53:43,541
You are in a court, not in a fish market.

917
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:45,166
Sorry, madam.

918
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:47,916
Just because my tie is crooked
and his coat is over ironed,

919
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:50,541
it doesn't mean
that no one will listen to me.

920
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:53,166
Fine, read out the F.I.R.

921
00:53:56,416 --> 00:53:58,083
"I, Disha,

922
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:02,666
son of Rulduram, testify

923
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:06,541
that I and Manna

924
00:54:07,666 --> 00:54:12,291
had gone to the fields early
in the morning at 5:00 a.m. to defecate.

925
00:54:15,375 --> 00:54:17,333
An airplane passed from above our heads.

926
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:20,750
It was flying very low.

927
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:24,333
I said, something is wrong.

928
00:54:25,166 --> 00:54:27,958
Then Manna said, let's hurry up.

929
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:31,458
So I started hunting

930
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:35,416
for a stone in the ground

931
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:40,666
and I found someone's feet, instead.

932
00:54:41,708 --> 00:54:44,000
I began to scream in fear.

933
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:47,458
Then I called the police.

934
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:50,291
The police came right away,

935
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:55,083
exactly after two hours."

936
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:59,791
Madam, tell me, where was
my client's name mentioned in it?

937
00:54:59,875 --> 00:55:03,041
On what grounds is he being held
the prime suspect?

938
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,666
Madam,

939
00:55:05,416 --> 00:55:08,416
the police found the murder weapon

940
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:10,541
and clothes drenched in blood
from his house.

941
00:55:11,958 --> 00:55:15,541
If you approve bail to someone
who commits such a serious crime,

942
00:55:15,958 --> 00:55:20,125
then people will lose faith
in the justice system.

943
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:23,666
Hence, the state requests you to send

944
00:55:23,875 --> 00:55:27,666
this boy on police remand
for at least 15 days

945
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:30,625
for the thorough investigation

946
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:32,041
of this case.

947
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:34,333
Mr. Brar is right.

948
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:36,416
Mr. Judge, tell me.

949
00:55:37,458 --> 00:55:38,583
What is the problem?

950
00:55:39,083 --> 00:55:40,416
Are you joking with me?

951
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,750
Joking? Hold on. Brother,
can I have a word with you?

952
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:43,250
-Yes, Sir.
-Tell him my chamber number.

953
00:55:43,333 --> 00:55:45,333
It's 302. Why? What happened?

954
00:55:45,416 --> 00:55:47,416
-Nothing. Wash your hands and leave.
-Fine.

955
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:49,500
I haven't lied to you.

956
00:55:49,875 --> 00:55:51,791
Judge and I studied law together.

957
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:54,333
He took five years to complete
a three-year course.

958
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:57,416
-Five years?
-Yes, that too, eight years ago.

959
00:55:57,875 --> 00:55:58,958
I wonder what he will do
in the court today.

960
00:55:59,958 --> 00:56:01,875
I feel sorry for his client, to be honest.

961
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,666
He wants to get him judicial custody.

962
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:06,166
But I'm certain
he will have him imprisoned.

963
00:56:07,791 --> 00:56:10,833
Madam, I say, if they have already found

964
00:56:10,916 --> 00:56:12,416
the murder weapon and other evidence

965
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,500
from my client's house,

966
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:15,500
then why do they need
to keep him in police remand?

967
00:56:15,833 --> 00:56:17,541
They are going to file charges
against him, anyway.

968
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:21,166
Ma'am, Mr. Brar seeks police remand

969
00:56:21,458 --> 00:56:23,458
so that my client can be tortured

970
00:56:23,541 --> 00:56:24,541
and made to confess a lie, forcefully.

971
00:56:24,625 --> 00:56:26,250
This is an insult to our justice system.

972
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:31,083
Ma'am, until my client
is sentenced as a criminal,

973
00:56:31,166 --> 00:56:34,125
the responsibility of his security
lies with the court.

974
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:39,333
Just once,

975
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:43,583
try to place yourself
in his mother's place.

976
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:45,791
If your innocent son

977
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,500
is trapped like this,

978
00:56:47,875 --> 00:56:49,833
then would you send him
to judicial custody

979
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:52,291
or to the police
to get him tortured even more?

980
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:54,708
That's all, Your Honor.

981
00:56:55,041 --> 00:56:56,125
This is a court.

982
00:56:57,375 --> 00:57:00,791
You cannot get any order passed
by making people emotional.

983
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:04,916
So, the application for bail is dismissed.

984
00:57:07,666 --> 00:57:08,958
Congratulations, Mr. Brar.

985
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:11,958
The police have already made
a recovery against the accused.

986
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:15,583
This case is based
on circumstantial evidence.

987
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:16,791
Hence,

988
00:57:16,875 --> 00:57:20,208
the accused
is shifted to judicial custody.

989
00:57:24,916 --> 00:57:26,708
What's happening? Stop it.

990
00:57:28,083 --> 00:57:30,958
-Sit down.
-Don't worry, ma'am.

991
00:57:31,041 --> 00:57:33,916
Police cannot trouble Sonu
in judicial custody.

992
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,250
Be brave.

993
00:57:35,333 --> 00:57:36,958
-He is right.
-Okay, my dear.

994
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:39,041
So, when will my son be released?

995
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:42,583
As we got the judicial custody,
we will get bail as well.

996
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:45,041
Dad, what are you doing here?

997
00:57:45,125 --> 00:57:46,666
We were waiting for you, inside.

998
00:57:47,416 --> 00:57:48,875
You should be ashamed of yourself.

999
00:57:49,125 --> 00:57:50,416
You lied to me!

1000
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:52,458
But Dad, I had told you...

1001
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:54,875
You think you are very clever?

1002
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:57,583
This was your first day in court.
That too because of us!

1003
00:57:58,041 --> 00:57:59,208
Listen to us, Mr. Amrik Singh.

1004
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:00,333
Oh, you shut up.

1005
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:03,125
-Idiot! Shameless people!
-Hold on, sir.

1006
00:58:03,375 --> 00:58:04,750
You cannot talk to my father
in this manner.

1007
00:58:04,833 --> 00:58:07,083
Why can't I talk to your father
in this manner?

1008
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:09,333
It is your father's fault!

1009
00:58:09,416 --> 00:58:13,541
You did things according to the values
he taught you.

1010
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:16,875
The other day,
you acted so innocent and said

1011
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:19,708
that your son is a famous advocate.

1012
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:21,625
He is no advocate!

1013
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:25,833
You guys don't know how to work hard.
All you can do is lie!

1014
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:28,750
Hence, your son is still idle.

1015
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:31,208
Hence, your son is still useless.

1016
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:33,625
Hence, your son is still single.

1017
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:37,125
I thank God for showing me

1018
00:58:37,541 --> 00:58:41,500
your true status before the wedding.

1019
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,208
What are you saying, Amrik?

1020
00:58:43,416 --> 00:58:46,500
-This poor guy...
-Don't intervene, Sister-in-law.

1021
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:48,166
Let me talk to them!

1022
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:50,625
Look Mr. Amrik Singh, I beg of you.

1023
00:58:50,708 --> 00:58:53,583
No, I beg of you.

1024
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:57,791
Don't show me your faces, ever again.

1025
00:58:58,333 --> 00:59:01,250
And don't ever try to contact me!

1026
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:04,583
Let's go, Sister-in-law.
I don't want to talk to such people.

1027
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:05,583
Let's go, dear.

1028
00:59:12,708 --> 00:59:15,916
<i>Which path should I choose?</i>

1029
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:22,958
<i>Whom should I express my feeling to?</i>

1030
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,583
<i>Which path should I choose?</i>

1031
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:32,416
<i>Whom should I express my feeling to?</i>

1032
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:36,000
<i>I have never faced such sorrow</i>

1033
00:59:36,083 --> 00:59:38,791
<i>I keep falling at every step</i>

1034
00:59:42,208 --> 00:59:45,541
<i>Life...</i>

1035
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:51,125
<i>Plays hide and seek</i>

1036
00:59:52,208 --> 00:59:56,500
<i>Life...</i>

1037
00:59:56,583 --> 01:00:02,541
<i>Plays hide and seek</i>

1038
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,125
<i>Ever since my beloved</i>

1039
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:26,333
<i>Severed ties with me</i>

1040
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,750
<i>I lost my mind</i>

1041
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:32,541
<i>Everyone knows, it's me</i>

1042
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:36,541
<i>Ever since my beloved</i>

1043
01:00:36,625 --> 01:00:39,625
<i>Severed ties with me</i>

1044
01:00:39,708 --> 01:00:43,041
<i>I went crazy</i>

1045
01:00:43,125 --> 01:00:46,333
<i>Everyone knows, it's me</i>

1046
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:49,625
<i>I cannot go forward</i>

1047
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,208
<i>I cannot go back</i>

1048
01:00:52,291 --> 01:00:55,541
<i>My ship sank</i>

1049
01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:59,000
<i>Where I couldn't swim to shore</i>

1050
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:05,291
<i>Life...</i>

1051
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:11,583
<i>Plays hide and seek</i>

1052
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:17,125
-Let's go, Judge.
-Come on, Judge. Get up.

1053
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:19,833
-Come on.
-Come on, get up.

1054
01:01:20,416 --> 01:01:23,208
How can he just call it off? Right.

1055
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:25,541
You cannot lose hope like that.

1056
01:01:25,833 --> 01:01:28,041
Come with me. I will talk to Amrik.

1057
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:30,416
There is still hope.

1058
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,083
Sometimes people say things
in a fit of anger.

1059
01:01:33,166 --> 01:01:36,208
This doesn't mean that the wedding
is called off. Look, Kuljit is here.

1060
01:01:36,291 --> 01:01:38,666
Now Kuljit...
She will convince her father.

1061
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:40,833
Why would I do that?

1062
01:01:41,166 --> 01:01:43,458
Get out of here. Leave!

1063
01:01:43,541 --> 01:01:44,833
Out. Get out!

1064
01:01:44,916 --> 01:01:46,625
-Leave.
-That's enough, Kuljit.

1065
01:01:46,708 --> 01:01:48,958
What? I didn't like you
since the day we met.

1066
01:01:49,041 --> 01:01:51,291
-Hold on. Let me talk to them.
-Get out of here.

1067
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:53,041
-Let's go!
-You guys are so stubborn.

1068
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:54,666
You came back here
even after being humiliated.

1069
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:55,791
-Kuljit, listen to me.
-Get out of here.

1070
01:01:56,083 --> 01:01:58,000
Get out from here! Get out!

1071
01:01:58,083 --> 01:02:00,291
-Kuljit...
-Get out. You too!

1072
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:02,291
-Get in.
-Leave. They want an alliance!

1073
01:02:02,666 --> 01:02:03,583
Get out.

1074
01:02:03,875 --> 01:02:05,416
-Get out!
-Listen to me, dear.

1075
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,333
Get out.

1076
01:02:06,625 --> 01:02:07,833
Dear...

1077
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:22,625
I have been looking for you.

1078
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,458
Judge, come and eat dinner.

1079
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:30,791
Come on!

1080
01:02:31,458 --> 01:02:33,708
You should listen to your father.
You are my son, aren't you?

1081
01:02:34,541 --> 01:02:39,458
Today, I asked Laxmi
to make your favorite dishes,

1082
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:44,541
potato cauliflower curry and lentils.

1083
01:02:47,875 --> 01:02:51,083
Let's go, my son. I am starving.

1084
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:53,000
My good boy. My baby.

1085
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:56,208
My good boy. Get up.

1086
01:02:57,583 --> 01:03:01,708
Get up, son, or I will...
I will be angry with you.

1087
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:04,833
Come on, let's eat our dinner.
Be a good boy, now.

1088
01:03:04,916 --> 01:03:07,875
Come on. Get up. Come with me.

1089
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:10,333
That's enough, Dad!
You have said enough. Go away from here.

1090
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,333
You have already done enough. Go.

1091
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,666
Sorry.

1092
01:03:17,458 --> 01:03:21,250
I think I said something wrong to you.

1093
01:03:24,708 --> 01:03:25,708
Sorry.

1094
01:04:49,125 --> 01:04:51,666
-Sorry, Dad.
-Judge!

1095
01:04:52,208 --> 01:04:53,208
Sorry.

1096
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:56,250
-Sorry, Dad.
-No, my dear.

1097
01:04:57,333 --> 01:04:59,500
-Don't cry, my dear.
-Sorry.

1098
01:05:00,666 --> 01:05:01,750
Don't...

1099
01:05:02,416 --> 01:05:03,541
Sorry.

1100
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:05,791
No...

1101
01:05:08,791 --> 01:05:12,416
No, my dear. Don't cry.
Don't cry, my dear.

1102
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,750
Don't cry!

1103
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:17,375
You were absolutely right.

1104
01:05:17,791 --> 01:05:19,208
You were right.

1105
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:22,125
I was the one who was wrong.

1106
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:33,875
I could never make you happy in my life.

1107
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:40,625
God should never give a child like me
to anyone...

1108
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:44,083
Hey. Don't you dare...

1109
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:46,708
Don't you dare say such a thing.

1110
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,333
I will slap you if you say that!

1111
01:05:50,583 --> 01:05:52,041
Don't cry, my dear.

1112
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,625
Oh, my child.

1113
01:05:54,708 --> 01:05:58,708
You are the reason I have survived.

1114
01:06:00,375 --> 01:06:02,250
Dad, I never thought about it.

1115
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:06,875
You are taking care
of all the responsibilities by yourself.

1116
01:06:11,541 --> 01:06:12,666
But not anymore.

1117
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:18,041
I have enjoyed a lot

1118
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:20,041
but not anymore.

1119
01:06:22,541 --> 01:06:24,083
Now, I will become someone
you can be proud of.

1120
01:06:25,375 --> 01:06:26,250
Yes.

1121
01:06:41,625 --> 01:06:42,791
is it fine, Father?

1122
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:44,375
-What?
-Is this fine?

1123
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,208
Let me take a look at it.

1124
01:06:48,708 --> 01:06:52,750
Lift it a little from the right.
A little higher.

1125
01:06:53,416 --> 01:06:56,375
Not that much. A little lower.

1126
01:06:56,458 --> 01:06:57,416
-Lower.
-Here you go.

1127
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,541
-Lower...
-How about now?

1128
01:07:00,958 --> 01:07:03,458
You have made it crooked.
Lift it a little higher.

1129
01:07:03,541 --> 01:07:05,166
Dad, you are not giving me
proper instructions.

1130
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:07,375
Here. Now, it's fine. Is it fine?

1131
01:07:07,666 --> 01:07:11,916
That's enough. Yes.
That's it. Put it over here.

1132
01:07:12,708 --> 01:07:14,166
And that's how you put up a board.

1133
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:16,750
Well done.

1134
01:07:37,541 --> 01:07:38,375
Sir...

1135
01:07:46,625 --> 01:07:47,500
Dad?

1136
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:50,708
-Where are you going?
-Why?

1137
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:52,625
Doesn't an advocate need an assistant?

1138
01:08:09,333 --> 01:08:10,208
Look, Mother.

1139
01:08:11,041 --> 01:08:12,916
Your son Judge is now an advocate.

1140
01:08:14,875 --> 01:08:16,583
Just give me your blessings.

1141
01:08:19,125 --> 01:08:21,541
You only want your mother's blessings?

1142
01:08:22,541 --> 01:08:23,583
And not your father's?

1143
01:08:25,708 --> 01:08:29,250
-Dad, you always come first.
-God bless you, my dear.

1144
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:32,625
God bless you, my child. God bless you.

1145
01:08:32,958 --> 01:08:34,083
May you prosper.

1146
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:38,041
-Now go and sit on your chair.
-Dad, you should sit on it first.

1147
01:08:38,375 --> 01:08:41,458
No. It's yours. You should sit on it.

1148
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,250
Sit on it, just once.

1149
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:46,416
You want to make your father cry?

1150
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:48,125
Go and sit on it.

1151
01:08:55,291 --> 01:08:57,791
-Jai Hind, Advocate.
-Dad!

1152
01:09:13,041 --> 01:09:14,458
-We want to get married...
-Excuse me...

1153
01:09:14,541 --> 01:09:15,958
-Excuse me. Come here.
-Sir...

1154
01:09:16,041 --> 01:09:17,375
-You too.
-What are you doing?

1155
01:09:17,458 --> 01:09:19,375
-Practicing.
-They are my clients.

1156
01:09:19,458 --> 01:09:21,666
-He is strange.
-Come inside. Sit over here.

1157
01:09:22,375 --> 01:09:24,083
-You ran off from your house?
-Yes.

1158
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:25,583
And now you want to get married?

1159
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:28,916
-Yes.
-You mean love marriage?

1160
01:09:29,458 --> 01:09:30,333
Yes.

1161
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,916
You have to begin from somewhere.

1162
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:36,458
Of course!
You have come to the right place.

1163
01:09:40,333 --> 01:09:41,208
Dad...

1164
01:09:47,541 --> 01:09:48,708
Say cheese.

1165
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:03,625
Okay? Didn't I tell you
your job will be done in three hearings?

1166
01:10:03,708 --> 01:10:06,250
I got it done. Henceforth,
if you have work related to the court...

1167
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:21,208
Do tell me if you need anything.

1168
01:10:21,541 --> 01:10:24,250
Yes. I will get all your work done
in this manner.

1169
01:10:25,541 --> 01:10:27,000
-Mom.
-Sonu.

1170
01:10:27,083 --> 01:10:28,708
What is the advocate saying?

1171
01:10:29,791 --> 01:10:33,083
Sonu, listen to me very carefully.
I have studied your case.

1172
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:35,083
T.S. Brar has gathered...

1173
01:10:35,666 --> 01:10:38,708
such evidences against you

1174
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:40,666
which are infrangible.

1175
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:42,250
You'll be sentenced to death, for sure.

1176
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,083
-I know you didn't kill her.
-No, sir. I didn't kill her.

1177
01:10:48,166 --> 01:10:52,291
Yes, but if you confess
that you killed her, in court,

1178
01:10:55,791 --> 01:10:57,625
then I won't let them
give you a death sentence.

1179
01:10:58,458 --> 01:10:59,500
What are you saying?

1180
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,875
You will be imprisoned for 11 to 12 years.

1181
01:11:01,416 --> 01:11:02,625
It will be over in no time.

1182
01:11:02,875 --> 01:11:03,958
What are you saying,

1183
01:11:04,666 --> 01:11:05,833
Counselor?

1184
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:09,583
This is just the first hearing.

1185
01:11:09,875 --> 01:11:13,916
You are saying disheartening things
even before the decision is made.

1186
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:15,208
Save my son.

1187
01:11:15,666 --> 01:11:18,333
At any cost.
We are ready to do whatever you say.

1188
01:11:18,666 --> 01:11:21,291
Ma'am, I am not saying
anything disheartening.

1189
01:11:21,375 --> 01:11:23,375
Whatever I am saying is for your own good.

1190
01:11:23,458 --> 01:11:27,375
If you still have doubts,
you can consult another advocate.

1191
01:11:27,458 --> 01:11:30,250
It's time for the case. I am going inside.
Come inside quickly. Let's go.

1192
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:31,708
-Let's go.
-Uncle.

1193
01:11:31,791 --> 01:11:32,791
Amrik...

1194
01:11:33,166 --> 01:11:35,666
-Sister-in-law...
-Sir, Mr. Soni's fees?

1195
01:11:36,291 --> 01:11:37,666
-Fees?
-Yes.

1196
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:39,333
Doctor,

1197
01:11:40,666 --> 01:11:42,833
on 22nd April, 2014,

1198
01:11:42,916 --> 01:11:46,208
the corpse of a person named Simranjeet

1199
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,208
-was sent to you.
-Yes.

1200
01:11:48,291 --> 01:11:50,541
-Did you perform on her post mortem?
-Yes.

1201
01:11:51,083 --> 01:11:51,916
Cause of death?

1202
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:55,583
That girl was attacked with a dagger
seven times on her chest.

1203
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,208
It caused her heart to rupture.

1204
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:02,083
Silence!

1205
01:12:03,208 --> 01:12:06,958
This is not an ordinary murder.

1206
01:12:08,583 --> 01:12:10,625
This is a murder

1207
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:13,875
that everyone in this society
is talking about.

1208
01:12:14,416 --> 01:12:17,375
Whether it's media
or the newspaper headlines,

1209
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:21,458
everyone is talking
about that girl's murder.

1210
01:12:21,708 --> 01:12:22,541
Why?

1211
01:12:23,666 --> 01:12:27,500
Because it was an innocent girl's murder.

1212
01:12:28,916 --> 01:12:32,541
She was attacked not once,
but seven times.

1213
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:35,791
Her beating heart was attacked.

1214
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:38,000
Her heart was sliced opened.

1215
01:12:39,916 --> 01:12:41,375
What's surprising...

1216
01:12:42,083 --> 01:12:45,125
is that her murderer
is roaming fearless in our society.

1217
01:12:45,875 --> 01:12:46,916
In the future,

1218
01:12:47,583 --> 01:12:50,166
the murderer can kill children

1219
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:52,666
or he can kill housewives

1220
01:12:53,125 --> 01:12:56,791
or even the working ladies, even you...

1221
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,833
I mean, he can kill anyone.

1222
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:06,208
Hence, I request the court in strong words

1223
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:10,458
that this murderer
shouldn't be put behind bars.

1224
01:13:11,375 --> 01:13:14,583
He should instead be hanged to death.

1225
01:13:15,916 --> 01:13:16,750
Amrik,

1226
01:13:18,833 --> 01:13:20,125
I am very scared.

1227
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,958
-I am feeling very scared.
-Nothing will happen, Sister-in-law.

1228
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:25,375
Your Honor,

1229
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,291
today I will prove in this court

1230
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,041
that the murderer is no one other than

1231
01:13:34,041 --> 01:13:38,833
this monster cloaked
behind this innocent face!

1232
01:13:38,916 --> 01:13:42,041
This person with an innocent looking face.

1233
01:13:49,041 --> 01:13:49,916
Yes?

1234
01:13:51,541 --> 01:13:53,833
-Your witness, please.
-No questions, Your Honor.

1235
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:58,833
My dear, why don't you ask something?

1236
01:13:59,666 --> 01:14:02,083
I know what I need to ask.
Please don't bother me.

1237
01:14:02,166 --> 01:14:03,000
Sister-in-law!

1238
01:14:04,208 --> 01:14:06,208
The police department
submitted that dagger to you.

1239
01:14:06,291 --> 01:14:07,125
Yes.

1240
01:14:07,291 --> 01:14:08,208
Do you have its forensic report?

1241
01:14:08,666 --> 01:14:13,416
The blood on the dagger
matched the corpse's blood.

1242
01:14:13,791 --> 01:14:16,083
You mean to say
that you are absolutely certain

1243
01:14:16,875 --> 01:14:18,333
that the murder was done with that dagger?

1244
01:14:18,666 --> 01:14:20,333
-Yes.
-Your Honor,

1245
01:14:20,958 --> 01:14:25,166
the police found that dagger in his house.

1246
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:29,458
I believe that we don't need
any other evidence, anymore.

1247
01:14:31,083 --> 01:14:31,916
Your Honor,

1248
01:14:33,375 --> 01:14:36,166
my next and important witness,

1249
01:14:37,958 --> 01:14:42,125
the only prime witness of this case
is Satnam Singh.

1250
01:14:42,541 --> 01:14:44,375
-Me?
-Yes, you come here.

1251
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:45,750
It's very hot in here.

1252
01:14:48,541 --> 01:14:49,666
Mr. Satnam Singh,

1253
01:14:50,625 --> 01:14:54,041
tell me, what did you see
on the night of the 21st of April?

1254
01:14:54,541 --> 01:14:56,041
I was going to the fields.

1255
01:14:56,208 --> 01:14:58,291
I heard a girl scream.

1256
01:14:58,458 --> 01:15:02,500
A boy was shoving a dagger
in her, repeatedly.

1257
01:15:02,583 --> 01:15:06,125
-Can you identify that boy?
-Me?

1258
01:15:06,375 --> 01:15:09,333
Once I look at a person,
his image is copy-pasted in my mind.

1259
01:15:09,416 --> 01:15:11,291
Then tell us who that person is.

1260
01:15:11,375 --> 01:15:13,541
He is standing right in front of you.
He is the one who killed her.

1261
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:21,708
Did you see that? They are very powerful.

1262
01:15:21,875 --> 01:15:23,375
And all the evidences are also against us.

1263
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:24,875
You should heed my advice...

1264
01:15:24,958 --> 01:15:28,416
My Lord, I would like you
to refer to the judgment

1265
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,541
on page number 120
in the booklet provided.

1266
01:15:58,541 --> 01:15:59,791
What god's wish...

1267
01:15:59,875 --> 01:16:02,500
Mom, have you lost your mind?

1268
01:16:02,583 --> 01:16:04,541
Why are you talking to
a murderer's mother? Come with me.

1269
01:16:06,833 --> 01:16:08,750
My son is not a murderer.

1270
01:16:09,625 --> 01:16:11,500
My son is not a murderer!

1271
01:16:11,708 --> 01:16:15,333
Sonu didn't kill anyone. He didn't!

1272
01:16:38,458 --> 01:16:40,333
Let me give you an advice.

1273
01:16:40,916 --> 01:16:42,458
You don't need to suffer anymore.

1274
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:46,375
Just go to TS Brar.

1275
01:16:47,041 --> 01:16:51,041
Either give him money or plead before him.

1276
01:16:51,416 --> 01:16:55,208
He is the only one who can save your son
from being hanged.

1277
01:16:56,875 --> 01:16:58,625
<i>In the Simran murder case,</i>

1278
01:16:58,708 --> 01:17:01,583
<i>advocate TS Brar has requested</i>
<i>a death sentence for the accused Sonu.</i>

1279
01:17:01,875 --> 01:17:05,208
<i>Let's see what the people</i>
<i>have to say about it.</i>

1280
01:17:05,291 --> 01:17:07,083
<i>He should be punished.</i>

1281
01:17:07,166 --> 01:17:09,833
<i>This boy should be shot to death</i>
<i>at the community crossroad.</i>

1282
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:12,166
<i>I say, why is he still alive?</i>
<i>Punish him, right away.</i>

1283
01:17:12,416 --> 01:17:15,208
<i>If this boy is not punished,</i>
<i>then the people will punish him.</i>

1284
01:17:15,291 --> 01:17:16,791
<i>-He should be punished.</i>
<i>-He should be punished.</i>

1285
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:25,083
-Excuse me, madam.
-Yes, sir?

1286
01:17:25,416 --> 01:17:26,875
We wanted to meet Mr. Brar.

1287
01:17:26,958 --> 01:17:30,166
He is in a meeting, sir.
You will have to wait.

1288
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:31,208
Sure.

1289
01:17:33,125 --> 01:17:35,291
Sister-in-law, why don't you understand?

1290
01:17:36,583 --> 01:17:39,166
I think we are making a huge mistake
by doing this.

1291
01:17:40,291 --> 01:17:41,125
Amrik,

1292
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:44,458
you have already consulted
so many advocates.

1293
01:17:44,875 --> 01:17:46,250
None of them agreed to help.

1294
01:17:47,166 --> 01:17:49,208
I want to meet him, once.

1295
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:51,958
He too has a mother.

1296
01:17:52,375 --> 01:17:56,291
It is possible that
he listens to me and helps us.

1297
01:17:56,958 --> 01:18:01,166
And then we too will be assured
that we tried everything possible.

1298
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:03,625
Sister-in-law, these people
are not how you think they are.

1299
01:18:03,958 --> 01:18:05,458
They won't understand us.

1300
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:09,041
Vijay Soni is a very good advocate.

1301
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:11,458
We should trust him.

1302
01:18:12,166 --> 01:18:14,875
Heed my advice. Let's go from here.

1303
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:17,958
Sister-in-law, please.

1304
01:18:20,708 --> 01:18:21,666
Please.

1305
01:18:31,416 --> 01:18:34,041
He will wear a noose and you, a tie.

1306
01:18:35,125 --> 01:18:37,166
I don't care if he is hanged.
But I should get what I want.

1307
01:18:37,416 --> 01:18:39,208
-I know.
-How do you know?

1308
01:18:39,291 --> 01:18:41,000
Everyone at the court knows.

1309
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,291
You... You want my son dead?

1310
01:18:48,666 --> 01:18:49,666
-You want my son dead?
-Ma'am!

1311
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:51,208
-What are you doing, ma'am?
-You want him dead?

1312
01:18:51,291 --> 01:18:54,000
-Sister-in-law! No, please!
-Go away. Get lost.

1313
01:18:54,916 --> 01:18:55,791
Sister-in-law!

1314
01:19:09,416 --> 01:19:14,291
Disgustful acts seem to have no limit
when it comes to you.

1315
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:20,458
God helps those
who are not helped by anyone.

1316
01:19:23,083 --> 01:19:26,833
Let's go, Sister-in-law. Don't worry.

1317
01:19:26,916 --> 01:19:28,708
Such people are not worth...

1318
01:19:41,791 --> 01:19:44,708
Sister-in-law, why don't you tell me
which advocate have you appointed?

1319
01:19:44,875 --> 01:19:46,083
Where is he?

1320
01:19:47,625 --> 01:19:48,833
Your Honor,

1321
01:19:49,916 --> 01:19:50,958
what's going on here?

1322
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:53,708
The defense lawyer is still not here.

1323
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:56,000
I'm supposed to wait for him?

1324
01:19:57,291 --> 01:19:58,916
T.S. Brar is fighting this case.

1325
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:02,250
So,

1326
01:20:02,666 --> 01:20:04,000
where is your advocate?

1327
01:20:04,541 --> 01:20:06,666
If you don't have one,
you can be provided a public defender.

1328
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:08,333
Don't waste our time.

1329
01:20:08,416 --> 01:20:10,000
No, Your Honor.
Give us a little more time.

1330
01:20:10,083 --> 01:20:12,083
-He is on his way.
-What is this?

1331
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:13,375
Sister-in-law...

1332
01:20:20,958 --> 01:20:21,875
Sister-in-law, what have you done!

1333
01:20:22,166 --> 01:20:25,041
Why did you call him?
How will he fight the case against Brar?

1334
01:20:25,375 --> 01:20:28,791
Amrik, he might not be
an experienced advocate

1335
01:20:28,875 --> 01:20:30,791
but he isn't corrupt like the others.

1336
01:20:35,041 --> 01:20:38,958
Oh my! Mr. Judge is back in my court.

1337
01:20:39,041 --> 01:20:40,166
Come, have a seat.

1338
01:20:42,208 --> 01:20:44,250
Should I call for tea
or refreshments for you?

1339
01:20:45,041 --> 01:20:45,875
Sorry, madam.

1340
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:49,666
-I am a little late.
-You should have informed us.

1341
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:52,833
I would have postponed this case
till tomorrow.

1342
01:20:52,916 --> 01:20:54,250
-Sorry, madam.
-Wonderful!

1343
01:20:54,708 --> 01:20:56,625
Today, your tie's knot is perfect as well.

1344
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Yes, madam.

1345
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:00,416
My phone is also on silent mode.

1346
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:03,958
Mr. Brar,

1347
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:05,583
did you miss me?

1348
01:21:05,916 --> 01:21:08,166
I will make you miss your granny.

1349
01:21:10,041 --> 01:21:14,625
Your Honor, request for re-examination
of prosecution witness Satnam Singh.

1350
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:16,041
Request has been already filed.

1351
01:21:16,833 --> 01:21:19,875
Great. Such fluent English, so quickly?

1352
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:21,333
Where did you learn it?

1353
01:21:21,791 --> 01:21:23,666
-Go ahead. Call your witness--
-Your Honor,

1354
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:27,000
the witness has already been examined.

1355
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:30,958
To call him back to the court
is a waste of the court's time.

1356
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:32,625
Is this a joke?

1357
01:21:32,958 --> 01:21:35,125
No, Mr. Brar. This is not a joke.

1358
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:39,916
For your kind information, according to
section number 311 of the CRPC,

1359
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,875
it is the right of the defense

1360
01:21:41,958 --> 01:21:44,250
to recall a witness any number of times

1361
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:46,916
if it leads to bring forth the truth.

1362
01:21:51,583 --> 01:21:52,416
Understood?

1363
01:21:55,875 --> 01:21:57,583
Go ahead and call your witness, please.

1364
01:21:58,958 --> 01:22:00,166
Thank you, ma'am.

1365
01:22:03,125 --> 01:22:05,291
-Mr. Satnam Singh.
-Yes?

1366
01:22:06,125 --> 01:22:08,416
At what time
were you passing through the fields?

1367
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:09,875
Around 12:30.

1368
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:12,500
-12:30 a.m.?
-Yes.

1369
01:22:12,958 --> 01:22:15,791
So, Mr. Satnam Singh,
it must be quite bright out there.

1370
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,875
What are you talking about, sir?
Why would there be light at that hour?

1371
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,791
It was pitch black darkness.
One person couldn't recognize the other.

1372
01:22:23,041 --> 01:22:24,875
In fact, I stepped on dung a few times.

1373
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,166
It's okay, Mr. Satnam.
It happens, sometimes.

1374
01:22:30,583 --> 01:22:31,416
Okay, now...

1375
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:34,875
-Take a good look at this photo.
-I saw it.

1376
01:22:35,666 --> 01:22:38,166
Mr. Satnam, we are not in a hurry.

1377
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:39,250
Have a good look at it.

1378
01:22:39,791 --> 01:22:42,041
Sir, perhaps you don't know me well.

1379
01:22:42,208 --> 01:22:43,666
My name is Satnam Singh.

1380
01:22:44,416 --> 01:22:45,500
I have a photographic memory.

1381
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,375
Once I see something,
its image gets copy-pasted in my mind.

1382
01:22:49,708 --> 01:22:50,583
Okay.

1383
01:22:51,291 --> 01:22:53,250
So, have you pasted this one?

1384
01:22:55,833 --> 01:22:56,666
Your Honor,

1385
01:22:57,541 --> 01:22:59,250
this is for your reference.

1386
01:23:01,125 --> 01:23:02,000
Mr. Brar,

1387
01:23:03,291 --> 01:23:05,625
-this one is for you.
-Move.

1388
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:10,291
Your Honor, I would like to request the
lights of the courtroom to be turned off.

1389
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:11,208
Hey!

1390
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,708
This is not a film set.

1391
01:23:14,458 --> 01:23:15,666
This is a real courtroom.

1392
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:19,166
Your Honor, what kind of a joke this is?

1393
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:21,666
It's okay, Mr. Brar. Have a seat.
Be comfortable.

1394
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:22,625
Sit down, please.

1395
01:23:23,125 --> 01:23:24,666
-Please have a seat.
-But he...

1396
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,375
It's okay. Let him fulfill his desire.

1397
01:23:27,458 --> 01:23:29,416
We will get to see something new.

1398
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:32,791
Besides, I am having a lot of fun
in the courtroom today.

1399
01:23:33,333 --> 01:23:35,041
Okay, turn the lights off.

1400
01:23:35,125 --> 01:23:36,000
Hold on, ma'am.

1401
01:23:36,083 --> 01:23:38,458
Wait for 15 minutes.
There is going to be a power cut anyway.

1402
01:23:38,541 --> 01:23:39,833
Stand there quietly.

1403
01:23:40,333 --> 01:23:42,916
Don't you know how to talk to a judge?

1404
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:43,833
-Sorry.
-Idiot!

1405
01:23:45,541 --> 01:23:49,375
Mr. Satnam, it must have been
this bright the other night.

1406
01:23:49,708 --> 01:23:51,291
No, sir.

1407
01:23:51,708 --> 01:23:55,291
It was pitch black darkness there.
One person couldn't recognize the other.

1408
01:23:55,375 --> 01:23:57,833
But people are visible here.

1409
01:23:57,916 --> 01:23:59,500
Okay. So you mean it was darker

1410
01:23:59,583 --> 01:24:01,291
-than it is over here.
-Yes.

1411
01:24:01,791 --> 01:24:03,916
And how far away were you
from the crime scene?

1412
01:24:04,583 --> 01:24:05,958
Move back a little.

1413
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:07,750
Here?

1414
01:24:08,166 --> 01:24:10,416
Take four steps back
and move to your left.

1415
01:24:12,208 --> 01:24:13,375
Move to your left.

1416
01:24:13,666 --> 01:24:16,166
-Okay. Here?
-Yes! Absolutely.

1417
01:24:16,791 --> 01:24:17,625
Please come in.

1418
01:24:25,041 --> 01:24:27,166
-Mr. Satnam...
-Yes?

1419
01:24:27,458 --> 01:24:30,750
Please tell the court,
from the photo I showed you...

1420
01:24:30,875 --> 01:24:31,708
Yes.

1421
01:24:31,916 --> 01:24:33,833
Which one of them
is the person from the photo?

1422
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:35,666
That's simple. This one.

1423
01:24:36,166 --> 01:24:37,541
-The one on the left?
-Yes.

1424
01:24:37,625 --> 01:24:40,333
-Lights on!
-No. Hold on. Goddess, help me.

1425
01:24:41,125 --> 01:24:42,458
I'm sure it's this one.

1426
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:44,333
This one.

1427
01:24:44,541 --> 01:24:46,583
-Him?
-Yes. For sure.

1428
01:24:46,666 --> 01:24:47,500
-For sure?
-Yes.

1429
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:48,708
Are you sure?

1430
01:24:50,541 --> 01:24:51,541
Tell me.

1431
01:24:51,625 --> 01:24:53,916
Since you asked me if I'm sure,
I'll say it's him.

1432
01:24:54,458 --> 01:24:56,083
-This one, for sure?
-Yes.

1433
01:24:56,458 --> 01:24:58,291
Okay. Lights on.

1434
01:25:04,416 --> 01:25:06,041
Have a look at the photo, ma'am.

1435
01:25:07,833 --> 01:25:09,708
It's neither of them.

1436
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,583
God bless you.
No wonder I was getting so confused.

1437
01:25:14,666 --> 01:25:19,166
When he couldn't recognize the person
in the photograph, in such brightness

1438
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:20,666
then how did he recognize him
the other night?

1439
01:25:22,333 --> 01:25:25,333
Your Honor, he is a false eyewitness.
He is a liar.

1440
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:29,916
Mr. Brar,

1441
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:32,750
a lie doesn't last long.

1442
01:25:36,958 --> 01:25:41,083
Sir, what if we lose the case?

1443
01:25:45,041 --> 01:25:47,041
The dead can never wake up from the grave.

1444
01:25:53,458 --> 01:25:55,250
Hello, SHO.

1445
01:25:55,791 --> 01:25:57,000
<i>Come and meet me in my office.</i>

1446
01:25:58,583 --> 01:25:59,583
Go.

1447
01:26:08,041 --> 01:26:10,208
Dad, why aren't you playing? Go on.

1448
01:26:14,041 --> 01:26:16,583
Why did you take on this case again?

1449
01:26:19,208 --> 01:26:20,250
Is it because of Kuljit?

1450
01:26:21,416 --> 01:26:22,916
No, Dad.

1451
01:26:29,125 --> 01:26:30,125
Dad!

1452
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,541
What's going on in your mind?

1453
01:26:33,458 --> 01:26:36,333
-Tell me.
-My dear, Brar...

1454
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:39,583
The MLA...

1455
01:26:41,583 --> 01:26:43,333
I suggest, you should leave this case.

1456
01:26:44,333 --> 01:26:46,041
How does it concern us?

1457
01:26:46,958 --> 01:26:50,166
Son, we are decent people.

1458
01:26:50,666 --> 01:26:52,250
We are not like them.

1459
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:54,666
I know we are not like them, Dad.

1460
01:26:54,916 --> 01:26:58,416
But we cannot turn a blind eye
to a man dying before us.

1461
01:26:59,333 --> 01:27:02,083
No, Dad. We are not such cruel people.

1462
01:27:06,458 --> 01:27:08,500
What is the inspector here for?

1463
01:27:11,916 --> 01:27:15,083
Welcome, sir. You will live a long life.

1464
01:27:15,250 --> 01:27:16,583
I was just thinking about you.

1465
01:27:17,458 --> 01:27:19,208
What have I done to you?

1466
01:27:20,375 --> 01:27:22,458
No, you have done us no harm.

1467
01:27:22,541 --> 01:27:24,833
Sir, I was looking

1468
01:27:25,125 --> 01:27:28,000
for the crime scene photographs
of this case.

1469
01:27:29,041 --> 01:27:30,000
I couldn't find them.

1470
01:27:31,458 --> 01:27:32,375
You took them, didn't you?

1471
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,083
We did. Why wouldn't we take them?

1472
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:37,625
Let me tell you a funny incident.

1473
01:27:37,916 --> 01:27:40,625
Actually, our photographer was a rookie.

1474
01:27:41,166 --> 01:27:42,000
At the last moment,

1475
01:27:44,166 --> 01:27:46,375
that idiot forgot to put the film
in the camera.

1476
01:27:56,208 --> 01:27:59,416
Get some refreshments, Laxmi.
The inspector...

1477
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:01,958
The inspector is here.

1478
01:28:02,708 --> 01:28:05,875
No, sir.
Don't bother with the refreshments.

1479
01:28:06,791 --> 01:28:09,708
You should take this.

1480
01:28:10,958 --> 01:28:13,583
This is a gift.
Mr. Brar has sent this for you.

1481
01:28:14,250 --> 01:28:16,458
Mr. Brar said there is no use arguing.
We should do something

1482
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:19,166
which benefits both him and you.

1483
01:28:19,541 --> 01:28:21,375
Here. Mr. Judge, take it.

1484
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:23,583
Mr. Judge, take it.

1485
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,750
It's money. It has come to you.
You shouldn't refuse it.

1486
01:28:28,833 --> 01:28:30,583
Take it, sir. That's great.

1487
01:28:31,125 --> 01:28:32,750
All right, then. Goodbye.

1488
01:28:38,541 --> 01:28:39,791
Why did you take it?

1489
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:44,208
Tell me! Why did you take it?

1490
01:28:45,625 --> 01:28:48,791
<i>You crazy ones, recognize me</i>

1491
01:28:48,875 --> 01:28:50,458
<i>Where have I come from?</i>

1492
01:28:50,541 --> 01:28:51,916
<i>Who I am?</i>

1493
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,416
<i>Who I am?</i>

1494
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,791
<i>Don! Don! Don!</i>

1495
01:29:36,208 --> 01:29:39,833
BIG MOVE FOR TS BRAR

1496
01:29:41,041 --> 01:29:42,583
<i>He is the first user</i>

1497
01:29:42,666 --> 01:29:44,791
<i>of TS Brar's public mobile toilet.</i>

1498
01:29:44,875 --> 01:29:46,375
<i>Let's talk to him.</i>

1499
01:29:47,125 --> 01:29:48,916
<i>Sir...</i>

1500
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,833
<i>-Are you from the news channel?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

1501
01:29:50,916 --> 01:29:51,791
<i>-Really?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

1502
01:29:51,875 --> 01:29:53,291
<i>Hold this, please.</i>
<i>What do you want to ask me?</i>

1503
01:29:53,375 --> 01:29:54,875
<i>How was your experience?</i>

1504
01:29:54,958 --> 01:29:57,875
<i>A while back, I was miserable.</i>

1505
01:29:57,958 --> 01:29:59,125
<i>I can't even tell you!</i>

1506
01:29:59,291 --> 01:30:02,666
<i>I felt as if I would never be free</i>
<i>from the burden.</i>

1507
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:06,250
<i>But now I'm so relieved, as if there</i>
<i>was no burden in the first place. Okay?</i>

1508
01:30:06,333 --> 01:30:09,916
<i>Would you like to say</i>
<i>a few words about Mr. Brar?</i>

1509
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,250
<i>-Mr. Brar is a very nice man.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

1510
01:30:12,583 --> 01:30:15,791
<i>But it would have been even better</i>
<i>if he provided free meals too.</i>

1511
01:30:15,875 --> 01:30:19,708
<i>Now, we have Advocate Judge Singh with us.</i>
<i>Come, let's talk to him.</i>

1512
01:30:19,958 --> 01:30:20,833
<i>-Yes, sir.</i>
<i>-So...</i>

1513
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:25,791
<i>Mr. Brar sent me the money the day</i>
<i>before yesterday and asked me to do it.</i>

1514
01:30:26,541 --> 01:30:31,208
<i>He wanted to do something good</i>
<i>for the welfare of the people.</i>

1515
01:30:31,291 --> 01:30:35,583
<i>Because he believes that,</i>
<i>since advocates make a lot of money,</i>

1516
01:30:35,666 --> 01:30:37,583
<i>we must use it responsibly.</i>

1517
01:30:37,958 --> 01:30:42,291
<i>So, I hope, Mr. Brar donates</i>
<i>for more such mobile toilets...</i>

1518
01:30:42,375 --> 01:30:43,583
You...

1519
01:30:44,666 --> 01:30:46,708
You turned me into a toilet supplier?

1520
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,208
<i>This is everywhere...</i>

1521
01:30:49,791 --> 01:30:53,125
People have schools built in their name

1522
01:30:53,375 --> 01:30:54,666
or even hospitals.

1523
01:30:55,333 --> 01:30:57,916
But Mr. Brar got toilets made, instead.

1524
01:30:59,125 --> 01:31:01,208
<i>There is a shortage of toilets.</i>

1525
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,875
Mr. Brar, you have done a great job.

1526
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:04,875
Get lost.

1527
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:08,375
Great job, you say? Get out!

1528
01:31:08,625 --> 01:31:11,875
<i>I think everyone will benefit from this.</i>

1529
01:31:11,958 --> 01:31:15,000
<i>And it will make Mr. Brar very famous.</i>

1530
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:16,458
What are you staring at?

1531
01:31:17,333 --> 01:31:19,416
<i>On behalf of everyone...</i>

1532
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,541
Sir, what Judge did was not right.

1533
01:31:21,625 --> 01:31:23,125
<i>-I thank him. Thank you, Mr. Brar.</i>
-Come here.

1534
01:31:23,833 --> 01:31:26,458
<i>And the enthusiasm I can see here</i>

1535
01:31:26,541 --> 01:31:30,750
<i>among the people for the mobile toilet...</i>

1536
01:31:30,833 --> 01:31:32,291
Who ironed your shirt?

1537
01:31:33,458 --> 01:31:35,958
-How much time did you take to iron it?
-It took 15 minutes.

1538
01:31:36,791 --> 01:31:39,916
It took 15 minutes!
You spent 15 minutes to iron it?

1539
01:31:41,541 --> 01:31:43,125
You are wearing ironed shirt!

1540
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:48,500
-You want to wear an ironed shirt?
-Sir...

1541
01:31:49,291 --> 01:31:51,375
Now go and iron it
for half an hour. Leave!

1542
01:31:52,708 --> 01:31:54,666
<i>Mr. Brar is a well-known advocate.</i>

1543
01:31:55,166 --> 01:31:59,166
<i>Mr. TS Brar's name will also get famous</i>
<i>for his mobile toilets.</i>

1544
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:01,750
-Yes, Mr. Brar?
-Dubey, tell me,

1545
01:32:02,333 --> 01:32:03,833
did Judge say anything

1546
01:32:04,458 --> 01:32:05,583
when you went to his house?

1547
01:32:05,833 --> 01:32:07,500
No. What can he possibly say?

1548
01:32:07,916 --> 01:32:10,000
He just asked about the photographs.

1549
01:32:10,333 --> 01:32:12,833
Photos? Don't underestimate him.

1550
01:32:13,333 --> 01:32:14,500
<i>You deleted them, didn't you?</i>

1551
01:32:14,583 --> 01:32:18,625
Yes, I deleted them. I set them on fire.

1552
01:32:19,416 --> 01:32:22,666
Did anyone else...
take photographs that night?

1553
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:24,666
No. That is out of question.

1554
01:32:25,375 --> 01:32:26,208
Oh no.

1555
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:27,833
Sir,

1556
01:32:28,250 --> 01:32:30,000
it's highly doubtful

1557
01:32:30,333 --> 01:32:32,166
but there were one or two
reporting photographers.

1558
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:35,000
You scoundrel, couldn't you have dealt
with it right at the beginning?

1559
01:32:35,416 --> 01:32:36,833
<i>Quickly find out about it.</i>

1560
01:32:37,416 --> 01:32:39,250
If he gets the photographs,
he will make me...

1561
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,250
Do you understand what I am trying
to say here?

1562
01:32:41,333 --> 01:32:42,625
I understand, sir.

1563
01:32:43,083 --> 01:32:45,625
Don't worry. I will go there, right away.

1564
01:32:45,833 --> 01:32:46,708
I will go there, right away, sir.

1565
01:32:47,208 --> 01:32:48,875
Hey, start the jeep.

1566
01:32:56,875 --> 01:32:58,833
PUNJABI JAGRAN

1567
01:33:00,458 --> 01:33:02,083
-Where is the director?
-Inside.

1568
01:33:07,583 --> 01:33:10,625
-Yes, sir?
-The crime scene of MLA's daughter...

1569
01:33:10,708 --> 01:33:12,750
-Yes.
-Did you take the photographs?

1570
01:33:14,875 --> 01:33:16,500
I am talking to you.
Why are you looking over there?

1571
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Mr. SHO.

1572
01:33:21,208 --> 01:33:23,416
Let me tell you about a funny incident.

1573
01:33:24,791 --> 01:33:26,125
You are late.

1574
01:33:34,333 --> 01:33:37,166
Your Honor, these are the photographs
of the crime scene

1575
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:38,625
which have still not been presented

1576
01:33:38,708 --> 01:33:40,083
in this courtroom.

1577
01:33:40,416 --> 01:33:43,125
Because the police made
these photographs disappear

1578
01:33:43,208 --> 01:33:45,625
to save MLA Harjeet Singh's son
Garry Mann.

1579
01:33:46,041 --> 01:33:46,875
What do you mean?

1580
01:33:47,333 --> 01:33:51,000
People mock the court
because of such novices.

1581
01:33:51,083 --> 01:33:54,375
This is the justice system!
It follows rules.

1582
01:33:55,666 --> 01:33:59,166
Young man,
you too will have to follow these rules.

1583
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:03,791
Mister, the justice system is made
to serve justice and not for the rules.

1584
01:34:04,041 --> 01:34:07,125
I think you are baffled
after looking at the photographs.

1585
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:10,083
You may submit the photographs.

1586
01:34:10,458 --> 01:34:11,333
What?

1587
01:34:12,208 --> 01:34:13,500
I agree that you are the judge,

1588
01:34:14,041 --> 01:34:16,125
but that doesn't mean
you can do as you please.

1589
01:34:16,208 --> 01:34:17,375
-Mr. Brar...
-Being a judge,

1590
01:34:17,625 --> 01:34:20,041
-you should be following rules.
-Mr. Brar...

1591
01:34:20,375 --> 01:34:22,750
How can these photographs be submitted?

1592
01:34:22,833 --> 01:34:23,666
Mr. Brar!

1593
01:34:23,916 --> 01:34:26,250
Neither do we know about the photographer.

1594
01:34:26,541 --> 01:34:28,583
-Mr. Brar!
-Nor do these have any negatives.

1595
01:34:28,875 --> 01:34:31,208
-Mr. Brar!
-How is it possible?

1596
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:32,875
-Sit there! Cool down.
-Don't forget

1597
01:34:32,958 --> 01:34:34,041
that you have been my junior.

1598
01:34:34,583 --> 01:34:37,000
-Sit there, Mr. Brar.
-You have learnt everything from me.

1599
01:34:37,083 --> 01:34:38,583
I said, shut up! Shut up!

1600
01:34:40,208 --> 01:34:43,208
Don't you forget
that you are talking to a judge.

1601
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:47,375
You won't teach me what I should be doing.

1602
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,708
Sit there! Go and take your seat.

1603
01:34:54,833 --> 01:34:57,291
A judge always tries...

1604
01:34:58,458 --> 01:35:01,583
to save an innocent

1605
01:35:02,083 --> 01:35:05,000
whether or not a hundred criminals
are punished.

1606
01:35:06,833 --> 01:35:09,500
So Mr. Judge, you may proceed now.

1607
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,666
-Disha, son of Rulduram.
-Yes.

1608
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:15,875
-Mr. Disha?
-Yes.

1609
01:35:16,791 --> 01:35:18,083
Do you recognize this person?

1610
01:35:21,125 --> 01:35:23,041
Yes, Counselor. She is the same girl.

1611
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:25,041
When we had gone to relieve ourselves
in the morning,

1612
01:35:25,333 --> 01:35:27,375
she is the one whose feet I had found.

1613
01:35:27,458 --> 01:35:28,666
How can I forget her?

1614
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:30,208
You can even ask Mann.

1615
01:35:42,666 --> 01:35:44,416
Doctor, have a look at this
post-mortem report.

1616
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:45,500
Okay.

1617
01:35:47,541 --> 01:35:49,583
Both these reports are from your lab.

1618
01:35:50,375 --> 01:35:51,250
Yes, they are.

1619
01:35:53,708 --> 01:35:55,833
Now look at this photograph and tell me

1620
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:58,500
with which post-mortem report
does it match?

1621
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:04,541
This one. Richa Sharma.

1622
01:36:05,916 --> 01:36:07,500
-With Richa Sharma?
-Yes.

1623
01:36:08,041 --> 01:36:11,500
But doctor, this is the photograph
of Simranjeet Kaur. How did this happen?

1624
01:36:15,666 --> 01:36:17,875
No... This is not possible.

1625
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:20,500
This shouldn't have happened,
but it did, Doctor.

1626
01:36:20,583 --> 01:36:23,625
Now you tell us how it happened. Tell us.

1627
01:36:24,375 --> 01:36:25,666
-Tell us, how it happened, Doctor.
-Your Honor...

1628
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,333
Tell us how this happened.

1629
01:36:27,958 --> 01:36:28,791
Please, tell us.

1630
01:36:28,875 --> 01:36:30,791
Tell us, Doctor. Tell us.

1631
01:36:30,875 --> 01:36:33,291
-Please, tell us. Tell the court.
-It is possible.

1632
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:35,041
My staff must have made some mistake.

1633
01:36:37,541 --> 01:36:41,375
Because Your Honor, it's always his staff
that makes a mistake.

1634
01:36:41,916 --> 01:36:43,708
-He never makes a mistake.
-What's happening, Brar?

1635
01:36:43,791 --> 01:36:46,708
Whenever there is a successful operation,
he takes the credit.

1636
01:36:47,083 --> 01:36:48,583
He gets the medal.

1637
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,750
But when the post-mortem reports
get changed,

1638
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,083
it's his staff that is blamed.

1639
01:36:54,875 --> 01:36:58,833
Doctor, I think
you should change your staff.

1640
01:37:00,666 --> 01:37:03,875
Your Honor, these photos clearly indicate

1641
01:37:03,958 --> 01:37:06,875
that the murder
never took place with a dagger.

1642
01:37:07,083 --> 01:37:08,791
Mr. Brar is misleading the court

1643
01:37:08,875 --> 01:37:10,500
with false evidence.

1644
01:37:10,875 --> 01:37:13,791
Now check the post-mortem report
and tell us.

1645
01:37:13,875 --> 01:37:15,333
What was the cause of death?

1646
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:19,041
This girl was killed due to a head injury

1647
01:37:19,541 --> 01:37:22,291
with an object that looks like a gear.

1648
01:37:22,916 --> 01:37:23,750
Hold on.

1649
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:28,458
Mr. Garry Mann,

1650
01:37:29,666 --> 01:37:32,166
-may I have your bracelet?
-No.

1651
01:37:32,458 --> 01:37:33,500
I cannot give it to you.

1652
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:35,458
Why can't you?

1653
01:37:36,041 --> 01:37:37,458
It's a gift from my sister.

1654
01:37:38,708 --> 01:37:39,708
Okay.

1655
01:37:40,333 --> 01:37:43,541
So, you kill your sister and then
you also carry her gifts with you?

1656
01:37:43,625 --> 01:37:45,708
What nonsense! What are you saying?

1657
01:37:45,791 --> 01:37:47,208
Hold on.

1658
01:37:49,541 --> 01:37:50,416
Give it to me.

1659
01:37:52,833 --> 01:37:53,666
Tahil.

1660
01:37:54,916 --> 01:37:55,750
Give it to me.

1661
01:37:56,125 --> 01:37:57,125
Darn!

1662
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:01,500
-Doctor.
-Yes.

1663
01:38:01,583 --> 01:38:03,791
Could the metal gear
be something like this?

1664
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:11,291
Probably,
it was done with something like this.

1665
01:38:11,916 --> 01:38:13,250
Not probably, Your Honor.

1666
01:38:13,833 --> 01:38:16,000
The murder was certainly done
with this bracelet.

1667
01:38:16,291 --> 01:38:18,458
Everyone present in this court knows

1668
01:38:18,541 --> 01:38:20,708
that Garry Mann
didn't like his sister's boyfriend.

1669
01:38:21,208 --> 01:38:22,500
And hence, he killed her.

1670
01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:25,416
But no FIR can be filed against Garry Mann

1671
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:28,083
because MLA have many contacts.

1672
01:38:28,166 --> 01:38:30,583
Hence, this poor boy
is being used as a scapegoat.

1673
01:38:30,875 --> 01:38:34,083
Thus, Mr. Brar got
the post-mortem reports changed.

1674
01:38:34,333 --> 01:38:36,416
Thus, Mr. Brar got false witnesses.

1675
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:38,958
Thus,
Mr. Brar planted blood stained clothes

1676
01:38:39,291 --> 01:38:41,125
and the dagger in his house.

1677
01:38:43,458 --> 01:38:44,708
Gift from sister.

1678
01:38:47,166 --> 01:38:48,166
Mr. Brar,

1679
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:50,083
he isn't a major risk to our society.

1680
01:38:50,333 --> 01:38:51,166
But he is.

1681
01:38:52,750 --> 01:38:53,625
Fine.

1682
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:56,500
Your Honor,

1683
01:38:57,666 --> 01:38:58,958
new evidence have come to light.

1684
01:38:59,416 --> 01:39:02,083
Hence, the state requests some time.

1685
01:39:02,875 --> 01:39:04,375
Take your time.

1686
01:39:04,458 --> 01:39:06,458
But now there is no evidence
against my client.

1687
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:10,416
Hence, I request the court
to grant bail to my client.

1688
01:39:10,833 --> 01:39:13,208
I have already submitted the application.

1689
01:39:13,916 --> 01:39:15,291
Bail granted.

1690
01:39:15,375 --> 01:39:17,208
Detailed orders will follow.

1691
01:39:20,750 --> 01:39:23,000
-Mr. Judge...
-Wait.

1692
01:39:23,083 --> 01:39:24,958
It takes two to three days
for the order to be approved.

1693
01:39:26,666 --> 01:39:27,958
Don't do that, aunt.

1694
01:39:35,291 --> 01:39:36,291
My dear, you...

1695
01:39:39,041 --> 01:39:41,500
You have messed with the wrong guy.

1696
01:39:43,083 --> 01:39:47,416
Now, you will see what I'm capable of.

1697
01:40:02,166 --> 01:40:03,625
So? How are you?

1698
01:40:03,708 --> 01:40:06,625
-I am fine. How are you?
-I am doing well. Thank you.

1699
01:40:08,458 --> 01:40:09,708
What are you saying?

1700
01:40:10,458 --> 01:40:12,333
I don't understand.

1701
01:40:12,875 --> 01:40:14,750
Kuljit, try to understand.

1702
01:40:14,833 --> 01:40:18,875
That girl has Canadian citizenship.
This is a question of my life.

1703
01:40:19,250 --> 01:40:21,208
In fact, it will benefit both of us.

1704
01:40:21,666 --> 01:40:23,666
Please, don't say such things.

1705
01:40:24,083 --> 01:40:27,083
Say that it's a joke.
You are joking, right?

1706
01:40:27,708 --> 01:40:30,000
Why are you crying?
Why are you crying, my love?

1707
01:40:30,583 --> 01:40:32,666
Eat this pastry. Eat it.

1708
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,833
I don't want to eat it.
You are worried about the pastry?

1709
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:39,625
Will you listen to me, Kuljit?
Will you listen to me?

1710
01:40:40,833 --> 01:40:41,708
Get married to someone else.

1711
01:40:43,625 --> 01:40:44,666
What did you say?

1712
01:40:45,583 --> 01:40:46,708
I should get married?

1713
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:48,083
To someone else?

1714
01:40:48,166 --> 01:40:49,375
Have you lost your mind?

1715
01:40:49,833 --> 01:40:52,416
How can you ask me to marry someone else?

1716
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:53,916
How can you even imagine that?

1717
01:40:54,333 --> 01:40:55,958
-Relax.
-Why should I relax?

1718
01:40:56,125 --> 01:40:57,375
I lied to my parents because of you

1719
01:40:57,458 --> 01:40:58,958
and you are asking me
to marry someone else?

1720
01:40:59,541 --> 01:41:01,250
Just because you want to go to Canada?

1721
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:03,125
Why are you creating a scene?

1722
01:41:03,458 --> 01:41:06,750
I am creating a scene?
I am creating a scene!

1723
01:41:06,833 --> 01:41:09,083
Shall I tell you what's creating a scene?
This is how one creates a scene.

1724
01:41:10,458 --> 01:41:11,583

Excuse me! You're not the only ones here.

01:41:15,125 --> 01:41:16,583
Go outside and fight.

1727
01:41:25,541 --> 01:41:26,541
Judge!

1728
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:28,541
Judge!

1729
01:41:29,416 --> 01:41:30,250
-Where are you?
-Manga?

1730
01:41:31,083 --> 01:41:32,041
Judge?

-You are drunk?

01:41:38,166 --> 01:41:40,500
-Come with me. Come.
-I am very upset.

1734
01:41:40,583 --> 01:41:43,458
-You are sloshed.
-I want to tell you something.

1735
01:41:43,666 --> 01:41:45,750
-Sit down first.
-Listen to me.

1736
01:41:45,833 --> 01:41:47,875
I lie to unite two people.

1737
01:41:48,625 --> 01:41:51,958
I do it to do something good for others.

1738
01:41:52,041 --> 01:41:54,708
Fine. But what is the matter?

1739
01:41:55,041 --> 01:41:58,625
Now how do I tell you?
I don't want to break your heart.

1740
01:41:59,166 --> 01:42:01,750
You won't break my heart.
Tell me what happened.

1741
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,458
Judge, we are very naive.

1742
01:42:06,041 --> 01:42:07,833
This world is very smart.

1743
01:42:07,916 --> 01:42:12,083
-It is not what it seems like.
-Manga, you...

1744
01:42:12,375 --> 01:42:16,958
The ones who seem the most innocent
are the biggest liars.

1745
01:42:17,041 --> 01:42:21,291
They look innocent but the devil resides
in them. They are not trustworthy.

1746
01:42:23,458 --> 01:42:26,333
-That's right.
-Something else altogether.

1747
01:42:26,708 --> 01:42:28,833
-Why didn't I think of it?
-Bring for me also.

1748
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:33,583
Judge. Judge, listen to me.

-Hello.
-Hello.

01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:52,166
What made you come
to my humble abode with your entourage?

1756
01:44:52,625 --> 01:44:55,625
I was just passing by.

1757
01:44:55,916 --> 01:44:57,375
So, I thought of paying Judge a visit.

Hello.

You remember, I had come to your house
with the money the other day?

1761
01:45:08,958 --> 01:45:10,416
How can I forget you?

1762
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:12,583
By the way, where is Judge?

01:45:14,416 --> 01:45:15,625
Judge...

1764
01:45:16,833 --> 01:45:18,708
He has gone to the neighboring
village for some work.

1765
01:45:22,125 --> 01:45:24,291
Why don't you have some refreshments
before you leave?

1766
01:45:26,208 --> 01:45:27,958
We were here for the refreshments!

1767
01:45:28,041 --> 01:45:31,333
Let's go. We will drink tea
as well as water.

1768
01:45:41,708 --> 01:45:44,250
Who is calling at such an early hour?

1769
01:45:52,541 --> 01:45:53,833
It stopped ringing.

1770
01:45:58,916 --> 01:45:59,750
Hello?

1771
01:46:00,625 --> 01:46:03,583
Sonu? Thank God, my friend.

1772
01:46:06,291 --> 01:46:10,375
Thank God, you are out on bail.
I cannot tell you how scared I was.

1773
01:46:10,458 --> 01:46:12,041
I was even breathing stealthily.

1774
01:46:12,125 --> 01:46:14,791
I feared that if you confessed
at the police station

1775
01:46:14,875 --> 01:46:16,333
that you killed Simran,

1776
01:46:16,416 --> 01:46:18,250
then I too would have
been hanged along with you.

1777
01:46:18,708 --> 01:46:20,000
I suggest we should go visit a Gurudwara.

1778
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:23,208
-Who is this?
-It's me, Preet.

01:46:28,666 --> 01:46:30,083

-Hi.
-Hi.

01:46:42,833 --> 01:46:44,708
Look what I brought for you.

1782
01:46:46,125 --> 01:46:46,958
Bracelet?

1783
01:46:47,208 --> 01:46:49,916
I brought one for you
and one for my brother Garry.

1784
01:46:50,291 --> 01:46:52,250
-It's beautiful, isn't it?
-It's very beautiful.

1785
01:46:53,083 --> 01:46:54,083
Just like you.

1786
01:47:08,833 --> 01:47:10,458
How could you even think

1787
01:47:10,541 --> 01:47:13,416
that we will approve
of your relationship with him?

1788
01:47:13,791 --> 01:47:17,416
Look at our level and look at his.

1789
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:19,791

1790

Garry, I love him.

1791
01:47:22,958 --> 01:47:25,416
And how dare you beat him up?

1792
01:47:25,750 --> 01:47:28,250
For now, I have only beaten him up.

1793
01:47:28,958 --> 01:47:30,250
If you don't stop seeing him,

1794
01:47:30,333 --> 01:47:32,416
-I will kill him.
-What?

1795
01:47:32,750 --> 01:47:35,791
And you will be responsible for that.
Only you.

It's been so many days.

1797
01:47:39,333 --> 01:47:41,833
Simran didn't come to meet me, even once.

1798
01:47:42,250 --> 01:47:43,666
I beg you to stop, my friend.

1799
01:47:43,916 --> 01:47:45,166
You got your head cracked open
because of her.

1800
01:47:45,416 --> 01:47:46,958
And you're still bothered about her.
You should forget about her.

What is this nonsense?

Nonsense?

Okay, don't you think

-what you have done to me is nonsense?
-Me?

1820
01:49:12,833 --> 01:49:15,083
Garry beat me up because of you.

1821
01:49:15,333 --> 01:49:18,375
Because of you,
I spent days in the hospital.

1822
01:49:18,833 --> 01:49:23,375
I kept calling you, repeatedly.

1823
01:49:23,458 --> 01:49:26,083
Sonu, I am doing this for your own good.

1824
01:49:26,666 --> 01:49:28,250
Garry will kill you.

1825
01:49:29,166 --> 01:49:31,208
So please, move on.

1898
01:55:12,833 --> 01:55:16,541
Your son loves to start
off mobile toilets, doesn't he?

1899
01:55:17,166 --> 01:55:21,666
I thought I too should inaugurate one.

1900
01:55:22,833 --> 01:55:25,958
I didn't bring goons with me because I...

1901
01:55:28,166 --> 01:55:32,000
I am TS Brar. That's me!

1902
01:55:32,833 --> 01:55:35,791
The police is with me,
the lawyers are with me.

1903
01:55:36,166 --> 01:55:37,458
The ministers are with me.

1904
01:55:38,083 --> 01:55:40,291
Even the entire government is with me.

1905
01:55:42,625 --> 01:55:46,750
Hence, you must convince your son

1906
01:55:47,916 --> 01:55:51,500
to get out of my way, this time.

1907
01:55:53,083 --> 01:55:54,208
Otherwise,

1908
01:55:55,041 --> 01:55:59,083
I will make the people of your village
defecate in your courtyard.

1909
01:55:59,625 --> 01:56:02,208
I will turn your house into a graveyard.

1910
01:56:04,875 --> 01:56:05,916
You...

1911
01:56:07,541 --> 01:56:12,083
better explain this
to your son Judge Singh LLB.

1912
01:56:13,208 --> 01:56:14,333
I will.

1913
01:56:16,041 --> 01:56:17,000
I surely will.

1914
01:56:19,083 --> 01:56:21,541
That when a dog gets scared,

1915
01:56:22,125 --> 01:56:24,875
he begins to bark.

1916
01:56:27,666 --> 01:56:29,500
And this time,

1917
01:56:30,416 --> 01:56:32,291
the dog is very scared.

1918
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:39,875
One more thing, Brar.

1919
01:56:40,458 --> 01:56:43,250
-What?
-I come from a family

1920
01:56:44,125 --> 01:56:47,791
whose kids' hearts were removed

1921
01:56:48,291 --> 01:56:52,291
and stuffed into their mouth.
But they never strayed from their path.

1922
01:56:52,875 --> 01:56:54,250
Whom are you trying to scare?

1923
01:56:54,708 --> 01:56:58,416
Just by holding this gun,
you think you can kill me?

1924
01:56:59,291 --> 01:57:00,916
If you have the courage, then shoot me.

1925
01:57:01,666 --> 01:57:03,041
Shoot. Shoot me.

1926
01:57:03,958 --> 01:57:04,833
Shoot me!

1927
01:57:18,666 --> 01:57:19,833
Yes, what do you want?

1928
01:57:20,833 --> 01:57:21,666
Just...

1929
01:57:23,041 --> 01:57:24,375
give me something...

1930
01:57:25,083 --> 01:57:29,208
which stops my heart from hurting.

1931
01:57:30,958 --> 01:57:32,750
This world is very cruel, mister.

1932
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:35,666
Give me something

1933
01:57:36,708 --> 01:57:39,791
which makes it look less cruel.

1934
01:57:40,291 --> 01:57:42,625
Perhaps this is your first visit to a bar.

1935
01:57:42,750 --> 01:57:44,500
Take this. Have a beer.

1936
01:59:01,916 --> 01:59:02,875
Laxmi.

1937
01:59:06,083 --> 01:59:07,583
Who had come here?

1938
01:59:08,708 --> 01:59:10,250
Who did all this? Tell me!

1939
01:59:12,916 --> 01:59:15,083
Where is Dad? Dad?

1940
01:59:15,916 --> 01:59:16,750
Dad!

1941
01:59:17,583 --> 01:59:18,708
Dad!

1942
01:59:20,416 --> 01:59:21,458
Dad!

1943
01:59:22,625 --> 01:59:24,541
Dad! What happened, Dad?

1944
01:59:25,958 --> 01:59:27,000
What happened, Dad?

1945
01:59:27,916 --> 01:59:29,083
Who did all this?

1946
01:59:39,750 --> 01:59:43,208
Judge, for the sake of your dead mother...

1947
01:59:43,958 --> 01:59:46,000
For my sake,

1948
01:59:46,833 --> 01:59:47,791
my dear,

1949
01:59:49,125 --> 01:59:51,125
you must crush...

1950
01:59:53,375 --> 01:59:55,208
Brar's ego.

1951
01:59:58,875 --> 02:00:01,083
Crush it.

1952
02:00:03,916 --> 02:00:07,583
Why is the world bent upon
fooling me alone?

1953
02:00:07,875 --> 02:00:09,958
Why would the world want to fool you?

1954
02:00:10,041 --> 02:00:12,750
Stop it now. I'm very stressed, already.

1955
02:00:13,166 --> 02:00:15,291
Daddy! I want to marry Judge.

1956
02:00:15,583 --> 02:00:17,750
That's it.
This is what was left to be done.

1957
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,083
Now you got me insulted too.

1958
02:00:19,375 --> 02:00:22,833
Let it be. I will talk to Judge.
He dances to my tune.

1959
02:00:29,125 --> 02:00:30,875
-Hello?
-Ma'am.

1960
02:00:31,708 --> 02:00:33,125
<i>It's me, Judge.</i>

1961
02:00:33,833 --> 02:00:35,666
I said a lot of things to you
in the heat of the moment.

1962
02:00:36,666 --> 02:00:37,500
<i>Don't worry.</i>

1963
02:00:38,625 --> 02:00:39,833
I will fight your case.

1964
02:00:40,708 --> 02:00:43,208
-Thank you very much, my dear.
<i>-No, it's okay.</i>

1965
02:00:43,875 --> 02:00:46,333
<i>-See you in the court, tomorrow.</i>
-Okay. Okay.

1966
02:00:48,833 --> 02:00:49,875
It was Judge.

1967
02:00:50,083 --> 02:00:51,958
He said he would fight our case.

1968
02:00:52,291 --> 02:00:53,541
Thank you, God.

1969
02:00:54,125 --> 02:00:55,125
I thank you!

1970
02:00:57,666 --> 02:00:59,125
Don't thank God, Mom.

1971
02:00:59,791 --> 02:01:02,375
You should thank that stupid MLA.

1972
02:01:03,916 --> 02:01:07,291
He still thinks
that his son committed the murder.

1973
02:01:08,208 --> 02:01:10,500
Dad, why don't you understand?

1974
02:01:11,375 --> 02:01:12,333
I didn't kill Simran.

1975
02:01:12,916 --> 02:01:15,041
Shut up! Stop your nonsense.

1976
02:01:15,458 --> 02:01:17,625
I am fed up with your nonsense.

1977
02:01:29,041 --> 02:01:29,875
Hello?

1978
02:01:31,125 --> 02:01:33,708
Get this straight.

1979
02:01:35,541 --> 02:01:38,833
If you lose this case,

1980
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:43,250
then I will be your worst enemy.

1981
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:46,291
MLA sir, why are you getting worried?

1982
02:01:47,458 --> 02:01:49,833
Even if something goes wrong,

1983
02:01:50,208 --> 02:01:53,125
I will approach the high court
and have everything settled in two hours--

1984
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:03,083
I will lose my reputation
if I lose this case.

1985
02:02:06,666 --> 02:02:08,041
-Sir.
-Yes.

1986
02:02:08,666 --> 02:02:09,875
May I come in?

1987
02:02:10,250 --> 02:02:11,875
Why have you come here?

1988
02:02:12,708 --> 02:02:15,208
You are my godfather. I am your student.

1989
02:02:15,291 --> 02:02:17,000
How could I quit your patronage?

1990
02:02:18,500 --> 02:02:19,500
May I sit?

1991
02:02:21,916 --> 02:02:25,375
Sir, you may think
that you have won the case.

1992
02:02:29,833 --> 02:02:33,458
Don't worry, sir. We will win for sure.

1993
02:02:33,666 --> 02:02:35,875
-So, Mr. Brar.
-Yes?

1994
02:02:35,958 --> 02:02:38,041
You were asked to make preparations.
Are you prepared?

1995
02:02:38,125 --> 02:02:39,875
Yes, I am. Of course I am.

1996
02:02:40,708 --> 02:02:42,000
-Go and call him.
-Okay.

1997
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:01,041
Hurry up, will you?

1998
02:03:11,291 --> 02:03:12,333
So, mister.

1999
02:03:14,750 --> 02:03:17,291
-What is your name?
-Prithvipal Singh Mahla.

2000
02:03:18,250 --> 02:03:21,166
-Prithvipal Singh Mahla.
-Yes.

2001
02:03:21,458 --> 02:03:22,916
What do you know about this case?

2002
02:03:23,666 --> 02:03:25,291
Nothing, sir. I don't know anything.

2003
02:03:26,416 --> 02:03:28,500
-Nothing?
-Yes.

2004
02:03:29,791 --> 02:03:32,208
Do you know that boy sitting right there?

2005
02:03:33,041 --> 02:03:35,000
He is my friend, sir.

2006
02:03:35,333 --> 02:03:36,875
-Okay.
-Yes.

2007
02:03:37,125 --> 02:03:39,041
-He is your friend.
-Yes.

2008
02:03:39,125 --> 02:03:40,416
Look,

2009
02:03:41,375 --> 02:03:42,458
be a lamb...

2010
02:03:43,291 --> 02:03:45,333
and tell the court whatever you know.

2011
02:03:45,750 --> 02:03:49,666
I assure you
that I won't let anything happen to you.

2012
02:03:50,250 --> 02:03:51,791
Really, sir. I... I don't know anything.

2013
02:03:51,875 --> 02:03:53,083
Prithvipal,

2014
02:03:53,625 --> 02:03:54,750
you do know!

2015
02:03:56,416 --> 02:03:59,750
And today,
you will tell everything to the court.

2016
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:05,500
You know
that you didn't commit the murder.

2017
02:04:06,458 --> 02:04:08,083
-I didn't, sir.
-You also know

2018
02:04:08,333 --> 02:04:10,166
who the murderer is.

2019
02:04:11,166 --> 02:04:13,208
You also know that you have a sister.

2020
02:04:13,916 --> 02:04:15,666
You also know that you have a mother.

2021
02:04:16,208 --> 02:04:17,208
You also know

2022
02:04:17,541 --> 02:04:19,541
that your father is no more.

2023
02:04:21,125 --> 02:04:22,583
You are shouldering the responsibility
of your family.

2024
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:24,958
Think about it.

2025
02:04:25,750 --> 02:04:30,625
If you go behind the bars,
who will marry your sister?

2026
02:04:31,041 --> 02:04:33,875
It is possible
that this shock might kill your mother.

2027
02:04:33,958 --> 02:04:35,833
-It is also possible...
-No, sir.

2028
02:04:36,166 --> 02:04:37,333
-...that your sister hangs herself.
-No, sir.

2029
02:04:37,958 --> 02:04:39,166
-And commits suicide.
-No, sir!

2030
02:04:39,250 --> 02:04:41,125
-You will be responsible...
-No, sir.

2031
02:04:41,208 --> 02:04:42,458
-for all this.
-No, sir!

2032
02:04:42,541 --> 02:04:44,458
Sonu has committed this murder, sir.

2033
02:04:49,708 --> 02:04:51,416
Sir, Sonu has committed this murder.
Sir, I witnessed IT.

2034
02:04:52,208 --> 02:04:55,208
Sir, Sonu killed Simran.
I didn't do anything, sir.

2035
02:04:55,916 --> 02:04:58,458
Didn't I tell you he killed her?

2036
02:04:59,458 --> 02:05:00,875
That's all, Your Honor.

2037
02:05:06,958 --> 02:05:09,958
Chap, you are naive.

2038
02:05:13,291 --> 02:05:15,708
Mr. Judge, would you like to question him?

2039
02:05:17,041 --> 02:05:17,916
No, ma'am.

2040
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:21,166
I have no questions for him.
You may leave, please.

2041
02:05:21,750 --> 02:05:23,375
Ma'am, I have a request.

2042
02:05:23,458 --> 02:05:26,416
If you could please play this CD
in the court.

2043
02:05:29,250 --> 02:05:30,083
Okay, ma'am.

2044
02:05:32,166 --> 02:05:34,333
<i>-Sonu killed her?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

2045
02:05:36,625 --> 02:05:39,375
<i>My God!</i>
<i>We unnecessarily did so many things.</i>

2046
02:05:42,208 --> 02:05:43,041
<i>I...</i>

2047
02:05:44,208 --> 02:05:45,541
<i>planted the dagger in his house.</i>

2048
02:05:46,666 --> 02:05:48,333
<i>I planted the blood stained clothes.</i>

2049
02:05:49,458 --> 02:05:51,666
<i>I got a false post-mortem report prepared.</i>

2050
02:05:53,208 --> 02:05:55,083
<i>I gave a lot of money</i>
<i>to many people, as well.</i>

2051
02:05:55,541 --> 02:05:56,875
<i>That's not something new.</i>

2052
02:05:57,625 --> 02:05:58,750
<i>Did you bribe the doctor, as well?</i>

2053
02:06:00,125 --> 02:06:01,166
<i>The doctor?</i>

2054
02:06:02,458 --> 02:06:04,916
<i>Of all the cases that I have won,</i>

2055
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:09,041
<i>most of them have been won</i>
<i>in this very manner.</i>

2056
02:06:10,250 --> 02:06:12,750
<i>The case was dismissed</i>
<i>on the grounds of evidence,</i>

2057
02:06:12,833 --> 02:06:15,833
<i>otherwise I would have</i>
<i>even bribed the judge.</i>

2058
02:06:16,208 --> 02:06:17,041
<i>Really?</i>

2059
02:06:17,833 --> 02:06:19,333
<i>But I don't understand something.</i>

2060
02:06:20,166 --> 02:06:23,125
<i>Why did the MLA have to do all this?</i>

2061
02:06:24,541 --> 02:06:27,708
<i>The MLA didn't love his daughter.</i>

2062
02:06:28,541 --> 02:06:31,625
<i>He just loves his position.</i>

2063
02:06:31,708 --> 02:06:34,083
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-He got scared.</i>

2064
02:06:34,541 --> 02:06:36,333
<i>If his image is ruined</i>
<i>in front of the party,</i>

2065
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:38,041
<i>he won't get a ticket.</i>

2066
02:06:43,083 --> 02:06:44,000
Excuse me.

2067
02:06:55,375 --> 02:06:56,500
-Hello.
-Judge...

2068
02:06:58,916 --> 02:07:00,875
Your Honor, my mother named me.

2069
02:07:01,666 --> 02:07:02,500
Excuse me.

2070
02:07:02,583 --> 02:07:04,625
My mother wanted me to become an advocate.

2071
02:07:05,541 --> 02:07:08,208
I took five years to complete
a three-year law course

2072
02:07:08,291 --> 02:07:10,750
because I wasn't paying attention
to my studies.

2073
02:07:12,833 --> 02:07:17,416
My mother thought that lawyers
are very honest people.

2074
02:07:18,500 --> 02:07:20,291
They help people get justice.

2075
02:07:22,666 --> 02:07:23,625
My mother was innocent.

2076
02:07:26,541 --> 02:07:29,500
Because madam,
no one here cares about the truth.

2077
02:07:30,708 --> 02:07:33,000
All people care about is winning.

2078
02:07:33,583 --> 02:07:37,875
And for that, they turn numerous truths
into lies and vice-versa.

2079
02:07:40,083 --> 02:07:43,416
Your Honor,
I'm happy to have lost this case

2080
02:07:43,625 --> 02:07:46,791
because the truth has triumphed,
not the lie.

2081
02:07:47,708 --> 02:07:48,750
Every day,

2082
02:07:49,125 --> 02:07:52,625
thousands of people
keep all their work aside

2083
02:07:53,125 --> 02:07:55,625
and walk out of their houses thinking

2084
02:07:55,708 --> 02:07:59,250
that perhaps justice
will be brought to them, that day.

2085
02:08:00,750 --> 02:08:02,125
But what do they get?

2086
02:08:04,375 --> 02:08:08,083
In 1857, when Macaulay formed the I.P.C,

2087
02:08:08,166 --> 02:08:11,125
he has made a pocket
at the back of this black coat

2088
02:08:11,208 --> 02:08:13,583
so that the common man could put

2089
02:08:13,666 --> 02:08:17,000
the lawyer's fees in it,
according to their status.

2090
02:08:18,083 --> 02:08:21,416
But nowadays,
that one pocket has turned into many

2091
02:08:21,500 --> 02:08:23,375
and are now placed in front of this coat.

2092
02:08:23,833 --> 02:08:28,541
That's why in every household
people fear the government officials.

2093
02:08:31,041 --> 02:08:32,291
Sir,

2094
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:34,541
you too should have a look
at your uniform.

2095
02:08:35,416 --> 02:08:37,208
It is so dirty.

2096
02:08:38,708 --> 02:08:40,291
Not from the outside.

2097
02:08:41,083 --> 02:08:42,541
Peep inside.

2098
02:08:45,625 --> 02:08:47,458
And he is the MLA

2099
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:50,458
We must applaud for him.

2100
02:08:52,166 --> 02:08:53,000
Your Honor,

2101
02:08:53,625 --> 02:08:56,416
he is not grieving
for the loss of his daughter.

2102
02:08:57,291 --> 02:08:58,833
Instead, he fears

2103
02:08:59,083 --> 02:09:02,458
that he'll be removed
from his powerful position.

2104
02:09:04,750 --> 02:09:08,666
Mr. Brar,
I have nothing personal against you.

2105
02:09:09,625 --> 02:09:12,000
Nor am I talking about just one advocate.

2106
02:09:12,083 --> 02:09:17,041
I am talking about every person
who is polluting our judicial system.

2107
02:09:19,125 --> 02:09:20,041
Sorry, Your Honor.

2108
02:09:20,458 --> 02:09:22,625
I think, I am wasting the court's time.

2109
02:09:22,916 --> 02:09:25,833
I said a little too much. Sorry.

2110
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:27,333
Sorry.

2111
02:09:30,125 --> 02:09:33,166
Your Honor, please don't stop me today.

2112
02:09:34,458 --> 02:09:35,791
Today, he deserves applause.

2113
02:09:42,708 --> 02:09:45,041
-Very good.
-Well done, Mr. Judge Singh.

2114
02:09:46,375 --> 02:09:47,708
I like the way you think.

2115
02:09:48,125 --> 02:09:49,000
I am proud of you.

2116
02:09:49,583 --> 02:09:51,000
Mr. Brar,

2117
02:09:51,958 --> 02:09:55,708
today I feel embarrassed
that I was once your junior.

2118
02:09:59,041 --> 02:10:01,541
Now, I will make a special request
to the BAR Counsel

2119
02:10:01,625 --> 02:10:03,333
to cancel your license

2120
02:10:04,250 --> 02:10:06,791
and to have a strict action
taken against you.

2121
02:10:07,333 --> 02:10:10,208
And an inquiry should be conducted
on all those people

2122
02:10:10,291 --> 02:10:12,458
who are involved in this case.

2123
02:10:12,666 --> 02:10:14,791
And Sonu must be taken into custody.

2124
02:10:15,166 --> 02:10:17,083
And detailed orders will follow soon.

2125
02:10:17,375 --> 02:10:19,500
-Let's go. Get up. Let's go.
-No.

2126
02:10:19,583 --> 02:10:21,458
-He is staring at us.
-Sonu...

2127
02:10:25,250 --> 02:10:28,375
For the video footage of Mr. Brar,

2128
02:10:29,375 --> 02:10:30,833
-did you use this pen?
-Yes.

2129
02:10:31,208 --> 02:10:32,750
-It is called a spy-cam.
-Look, this is a camera.

2130
02:10:32,833 --> 02:10:35,041
It's installed in front of it.

2131
02:10:36,500 --> 02:10:38,083
Mr. Brar got humiliated.

2132
02:10:40,833 --> 02:10:42,208
-We quit.
-Goodbye.

2133
02:10:49,166 --> 02:10:50,916
Give way. Move.

2134
02:10:56,833 --> 02:10:59,750
Sorry, Judge.
I sold my conscience for money.

2135
02:10:59,833 --> 02:11:01,833
Forget it. It's okay.

2136
02:11:02,041 --> 02:11:05,291
This would not have been possible
had you not done what you did.

2137
02:11:05,583 --> 02:11:07,375
-Your pen was very helpful.
-Really?

2138
02:11:07,458 --> 02:11:08,708
It ruined Brar.

2139
02:11:10,458 --> 02:11:11,625
Why are you laughing?

2140
02:11:11,958 --> 02:11:14,375
Do you think
that you have brought me down?

2141
02:11:14,666 --> 02:11:18,583
I can ruin people like you in a jiffy.

2142
02:11:18,875 --> 02:11:19,750
Like this.

2143
02:11:20,166 --> 02:11:21,291
I am Brar.

2144
02:11:21,833 --> 02:11:23,583
T.S. Brar!

2145
02:11:24,041 --> 02:11:27,875
I will make sure I teach you a lesson.

2146
02:11:28,208 --> 02:11:32,333
This man standing next to you
has witnessed what I'm capable of.

2147
02:11:32,833 --> 02:11:36,333
I went into your house,
I opened the fridge, I...

2148
02:11:40,875 --> 02:11:43,375
-And you couldn't do me any harm.
-You...!

2149
02:11:50,375 --> 02:11:53,166
Mr. Brar, does your ear hurt?

2150
02:11:54,458 --> 02:11:57,166
Heat up some mustard oil and apply it.

2151
02:11:59,666 --> 02:12:01,791
Well done, champion.

2152
02:12:02,541 --> 02:12:04,541
Some win and some become sore losers.

2153
02:12:04,833 --> 02:12:07,500
Good, Judge. Good. Very good. Well done.

2154
02:12:07,916 --> 02:12:10,333
-I salute you. I salute you. Okay.
-Bye.

2155
02:12:10,708 --> 02:12:13,750
Let's go, Dad. My dear, didn't I tell you

2156
02:12:14,291 --> 02:12:17,708
-that truth eventually wins?
-Judge!

2157
02:12:19,833 --> 02:12:20,666
Judge...

2158
02:12:21,166 --> 02:12:22,708
I want to tell you something.

2159
02:12:24,041 --> 02:12:26,541
-Yes, tell me.
-I am really sorry, Judge.

2160
02:12:26,875 --> 02:12:28,500
I am really sorry for whatever happened.

2161
02:12:29,291 --> 02:12:32,791
Sir, I am sorry.
My father and I were rude to you.

2162
02:12:35,041 --> 02:12:35,875
It's okay.

2163
02:12:36,875 --> 02:12:39,125
It happens. It's all right.

2164
02:12:40,500 --> 02:12:42,958
I thought about it
and I realized that I was wrong.

2165
02:12:43,125 --> 02:12:46,583
But now I am ready.
Let's get married, Judge.

2166
02:13:02,750 --> 02:13:05,458
You are very funny.

2167
02:13:07,625 --> 02:13:09,500
Let's go, Dad. Sit.

2168
02:13:10,833 --> 02:13:12,958
Move aside. Move.

2169
02:13:13,041 --> 02:13:14,291
Don't come under it.

2170
02:13:14,541 --> 02:13:16,583
Well done, my dear. Well done.

2171
02:13:16,666 --> 02:13:19,208
This is called winning even after losing.

2172
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:23,583
Dad, today the eighth marriage proposal
was rejected.

2173
02:13:23,666 --> 02:13:26,375
<i>I think, just like you,</i>
<i>the 15th one will be successful.</i>
