1
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,335
How far is the border?
- Around 10-1 2 km.

2
00:03:23,678 --> 00:03:26,772
Drive the vehicle fast.
Nura must be there.

3
00:03:35,457 --> 00:03:38,688
Arjun, I will get the
tea for both of us.

4
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:08,653
Arjun! This place caught fire. Fire!

5
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:20,562
Come. I will take you
on a trip to India.

6
00:04:33,615 --> 00:04:35,810
Aftab, it's very difficult
to deal with you.

7
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:38,284
Aftab, listen to me. Let's go back.

8
00:04:39,688 --> 00:04:41,815
It's very difficult to do
a robbery on the border.

9
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,357
We will get killed,
if we get caught.

10
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,792
Aftab, listen to me. Let's go back.

11
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,360
Aftab, what are you doing?

12
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,973
Do what I asked you to do.

13
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,803
Aftab.

14
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,994
There are expIosives in the boxes.

15
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,818
Did you have any problem
to come here?

16
00:07:02,564 --> 00:07:05,761
No. Your man was there
at the right place.

17
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:09,236
Unload the truck. We have
to return in one hour..

18
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,238
..or else the shifts
will be changed.

19
00:07:25,754 --> 00:07:27,984
Check the goods.

20
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,255
Catch him.

21
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,930
Fast. Let's go.

22
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:43,294
Come on, follow them!

23
00:07:48,877 --> 00:07:52,608
No one will shoot. The truck
is full of explosives.

24
00:07:53,615 --> 00:07:58,484
Fast, Kareem, fast.

25
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,852
Aftab, they are coming.

26
00:08:02,557 --> 00:08:03,615
Overtake.

27
00:08:08,263 --> 00:08:09,753
Aftab, they are chasing us.

28
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:12,632
Take out the pin and
throw the granite.

29
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,636
No. I can't do it. - Take out
the pin and throw the granite.

30
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:25,772
Aftab, the granite
fell in our truck.

31
00:08:25,847 --> 00:08:29,647
Pick it up and throw it outside.
- It isn't visible.

32
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:33,312
Then search it.
- I can't find it.

33
00:08:35,423 --> 00:08:36,481
Get out of the truck.

34
00:09:04,686 --> 00:09:06,813
He is Mustafa. He belongs
to our village.

35
00:09:12,627 --> 00:09:14,322
I will slice out your skin.

36
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,564
How dare you to sleep while
guarding at the border!

37
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:20,760
You sleep. You sleep.
- Sorry boss.

38
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:23,230
Just a couple of days ago
there has been a talks..

39
00:09:23,304 --> 00:09:24,635
..about our regiment
in the parliament.

40
00:09:24,706 --> 00:09:26,469
They will send an enquiry
commission on us.

41
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:29,533
They will send an enquiry
commission on us.

42
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,977
What will I answer!
What will I answer!

43
00:09:32,313 --> 00:09:35,612
That I was helpless!
could not do anything.

44
00:09:35,683 --> 00:09:36,741
Tell me.

45
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,888
Leave him, sir.
- Tie them.

46
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,388
Tiwari.
- Yes, sir.

47
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:44,516
Come on move.

48
00:09:45,426 --> 00:09:47,860
Mr. Vaikunth, there is no use
in getting upset with him.

49
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:49,521
They are just the pawns.

50
00:09:49,597 --> 00:09:51,394
Someone else is the real culprit.

51
00:09:53,935 --> 00:09:55,926
We have to do something, Bhakta.

52
00:09:57,772 --> 00:10:01,264
This is Rajasthan. There
are many things hidden..

53
00:10:01,342 --> 00:10:03,674
..in these deserts.

54
00:10:05,747 --> 00:10:06,805
It will be fun.

55
00:10:19,794 --> 00:10:22,695
Where did you go last night?
- No where.

56
00:10:22,764 --> 00:10:26,757
You are lying. Mustafa told me
that you went to borders again.

57
00:10:29,904 --> 00:10:31,303
You are looking very beautiful.

58
00:10:31,372 --> 00:10:33,306
You know that we are going
to Jammu tomorrow..

59
00:10:33,374 --> 00:10:34,807
..to attend Rihana's
marriage ceremony.

60
00:10:34,876 --> 00:10:37,470
And then father is getting
transferred to DhauIpur.

61
00:10:37,545 --> 00:10:39,376
When will come to my house
with the marriage proposal?

62
00:10:40,648 --> 00:10:42,047
I already made the proposal.

63
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:47,413
To whom?
- To my God.

64
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,050
Don't crack jokes.

65
00:10:51,726 --> 00:10:55,560
Would you like to see the heaven?
- Heaven!

66
00:10:55,863 --> 00:11:01,733
Come here. Do you trust me?

67
00:11:03,771 --> 00:11:08,640
A little bit. Then close your eyes.
- Why?

68
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,438
Your eyes are so beautiful that
if I keep looking at them then..

69
00:11:13,815 --> 00:11:18,275
Then?
- The thing that I will..

70
00:11:18,353 --> 00:11:21,686
..show you will take some time.

71
00:11:22,657 --> 00:11:25,683
But I would like to tell something
about that first.

72
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,284
Would you like to feel it?

73
00:11:33,801 --> 00:11:35,325
Then close your eyes.

74
00:11:38,873 --> 00:11:44,869
The first breeze wishes to touch
you. - Let it touch me.

75
00:11:45,847 --> 00:11:51,877
The sky has spread its arms. It
wants to hug you. - Let it hug.

76
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:55,888
It is about to rain.
- Let it rain.

77
00:11:56,724 --> 00:11:59,318
The first drop from the
sky is coming toward you.

78
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:03,487
Let it come.
- It wants to make you wet.

79
00:12:04,832 --> 00:12:08,996
Let it make me wet. And you..

80
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,326
''This heart, crazy in love!''

81
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:37,830
''This heart, crazy in love!''

82
00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:40,666
''This heart, crazy in love!''

83
00:12:40,735 --> 00:12:42,635
''This heart, crazy in love!''

84
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:47,432
''Winning over your heart.''

85
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:52,443
''Giving my heart to you!"

86
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:55,872
''Winning over you heart!"

87
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,714
''Giving my heart to you!"

88
00:12:58,786 --> 00:13:02,381
''In this winning over and giving!''

89
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:07,851
''Just don't know where
I have lost my heart!"

90
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:13,423
''My heart has turned stranger."

91
00:13:13,935 --> 00:13:18,736
''My heart has turned stranger."

92
00:13:18,973 --> 00:13:21,669
''Winning over you heart!"

93
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:23,801
''Giving my heart to you!"

94
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:28,006
''In this winning over and giving!''

95
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,447
''Just don't know where
I have lost my heart!"

96
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:39,317
''My heart has turned stranger."

97
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:44,495
''My heart has turned stranger."

98
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:28,003
''My heart is with you."

99
00:14:28,442 --> 00:14:33,880
''Your heart is with me."

100
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,886
''My heart is with you."

101
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:49,521
''Your heart is with me."

102
00:14:49,697 --> 00:14:54,691
''Ever since I have seen you."

103
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:59,297
''I doubted this to happen..''

104
00:14:59,373 --> 00:15:05,744
''..that it would leave me and
go someday. Here, it has gone."

105
00:15:07,848 --> 00:15:11,978
''My heart has turned stranger."

106
00:15:12,587 --> 00:15:17,422
''My heart has turned stranger."

107
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:50,885
''There is only a one-way
path to tread on.''

108
00:15:51,692 --> 00:15:56,595
''With no option of coming back.''

109
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:06,773
''There is only a one-way
path to tread on.''

110
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:11,835
''With no option of coming back.''

111
00:16:12,747 --> 00:16:17,241
''By dreaming the dreams of love."

112
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:22,416
''We have turned our own enemies.''

113
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,253
''We couldn't get sleep even..

114
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:28,853
''..when the whole world
slept peacefully.''

115
00:16:29,997 --> 00:16:34,593
''My heart has turned stranger."

116
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:40,006
''My heart has turned stranger."

117
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,274
''This heart, crazy in love!''

118
00:16:48,349 --> 00:16:50,783
''This heart, crazy in love!''

119
00:16:51,018 --> 00:16:53,509
''This heart, crazy in love!''

120
00:16:53,587 --> 00:16:56,021
''This heart, crazy in love!''

121
00:17:16,844 --> 00:17:19,244
Tell me who was there in the
truck with you that night.

122
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,519
He can't praise himself.

123
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,848
He is a very hardworking person.

124
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:32,819
Just within two months,
he bought a factory.

125
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:37,529
With Allah's grace, we
are living happily.

126
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,260
There is just one thing
missing in our life..

127
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:42,268
..And that is a daughter-in-law.

128
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,299
What does his father do?

129
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:53,511
He isn't with us. He is there
where he loves most to be.

130
00:17:54,682 --> 00:17:58,448
When did he expire?
- I can't see Ruksana.

131
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,680
I will call her in a moment.
- Hold on.

132
00:18:02,857 --> 00:18:05,257
But before that we shall
make a few things clear.

133
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:06,958
I didn't understand you.

134
00:18:08,729 --> 00:18:10,754
Sister, we too belong to Rajasthan.

135
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,425
We are a well reputed family.

136
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:15,799
And what will I tell them about
my son-in-law's family.

137
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,970
We can't buy character
from the market.

138
00:18:19,407 --> 00:18:20,567
That lies in the blood.

139
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,476
Mr. Shaikh my father was
the priest of Ajmer.

140
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,280
And my grandfather was
the high priest.

141
00:18:32,353 --> 00:18:33,615
And what about Aftab's father?

142
00:18:34,922 --> 00:18:37,322
Sister! Don't force me be harsh!

143
00:18:37,391 --> 00:18:39,621
There is no surname
attached to his name.

144
00:18:39,693 --> 00:18:42,253
The father's surname is
the help which can save..

145
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,388
..a son from the dangerous winds.

146
00:18:44,465 --> 00:18:48,492
He doesn't have any help of that
sort. - Mother, let's go.

147
00:19:37,651 --> 00:19:41,246
Hi.
- Let's go. We are late.

148
00:19:41,322 --> 00:19:43,756
Nervous.
- No. Why?

149
00:19:43,824 --> 00:19:45,758
Your lawyer told me everything.

150
00:19:46,827 --> 00:19:50,263
You have put everything at
stake for this contract.

151
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,261
Ragini, I will get that
contract because..

152
00:19:54,335 --> 00:19:58,999
..I am so well prepared that
they can't say no to me.

153
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,768
We are very happy with
your hard work.

154
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,639
Well done, Mr. Dhananjay.
- Thanks.

155
00:20:05,613 --> 00:20:08,548
Well. That's pretty
much it, gentlemen.

156
00:20:08,616 --> 00:20:11,278
I've booked the main hoarding of
the biggest hotels of lndia..

157
00:20:11,352 --> 00:20:14,753
..and I've already booked the
leading newspapers of India.

158
00:20:14,822 --> 00:20:16,551
I have already paid the advance.

159
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:21,887
You product will launch like a
cyclone.. like a thunderstorm..

160
00:20:22,463 --> 00:20:25,830
And it will capture the Indian
market. - Mr. Pandit.

161
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,767
Sir! You don't know how
much I have worked on it.

162
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:30,565
We must move with this
campaign immediately.

163
00:20:30,638 --> 00:20:32,765
Mr. Pandit. We are with you.

164
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,308
But these papers will
be signed when..

165
00:20:35,376 --> 00:20:38,038
..our chairman returns from foreign
the day after tomorrow.

166
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:41,644
Congratulations, anyways this
contract belongs to you know.

167
00:20:41,715 --> 00:20:42,773
Thank you very much.

168
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,715
- Jai! Do it fast.. or
the show will being.

169
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,843
- But first of all
listen to my plan.

170
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,321
What plan?
- About our future.

171
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,915
Ragini. I have prepared
it with so much effort.

172
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:54,054
Ok, tell me.
- Great.

173
00:20:54,395 --> 00:20:57,421
The moment the contract is done..

174
00:20:57,498 --> 00:20:59,329
The moment the
papers are signed..

175
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,392
We shall start the shopping
for our marriage on 1 4th.

176
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:05,870
On 16th the cards will be printed
and on 18th.. - Enough!

177
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,875
Don't see big dreams. I feel scared.

178
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,671
No one knows what is going
to happen after 5 minutes.

179
00:21:13,747 --> 00:21:15,442
Anything may go wrong suddenly.

180
00:21:15,516 --> 00:21:17,279
Nothing will go wrong, Ragini.

181
00:21:17,785 --> 00:21:19,446
The timid people think like that.

182
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,545
I will get what I set out to get.

183
00:21:22,623 --> 00:21:24,284
Will I?

184
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,852
Definitely.

185
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:36,862
Jai! Your photo on the
front page. Check this.

186
00:21:36,937 --> 00:21:40,304
Dhananjay Pandit is receiving
the biggest award..

187
00:21:40,374 --> 00:21:43,036
..of advertising from
justice Swarabji. Wow!

188
00:21:43,711 --> 00:21:45,906
He will rule the India
business market.

189
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,813
The 25 year old smart,
dashing, dynamic..

190
00:21:49,883 --> 00:21:53,944
Hold on. I think for the time
being, dynamic is sufficient.

191
00:21:54,388 --> 00:22:00,554
And also handsome.
- But Mr. Swarabji here.

192
00:22:00,628 --> 00:22:02,289
Do you feel he is handsome?

193
00:22:02,596 --> 00:22:05,258
May be.
- Shut up, Ragini.

194
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:07,627
Now what I have
planned will happen.

195
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,261
Because the world that
I have thought about..

196
00:22:10,337 --> 00:22:14,501
..there will be you and me
and there will be success.

197
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:17,744
What do you say?
- You are just a kid.

198
00:22:17,811 --> 00:22:18,903
You are absolutely like a kid.

199
00:22:18,979 --> 00:22:21,914
Yes, I am a kid, but I
am a very naughty kid.

200
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:24,340
I will blow your band.

201
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:33,657
Hello.
- Mr. Pandit.

202
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,287
Yes, this is Mr. Pandit.
- I am doctor Shekhavat speaking..

203
00:22:36,363 --> 00:22:39,799
..from Manpur, Rajasthan.
- Yes.

204
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:41,858
You father is admitted
in my hospital.

205
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:44,803
What happened to father?
- His condition is serious.

206
00:22:44,872 --> 00:22:47,864
You come here soon.
- Thank you, doctor. I'll be there.

207
00:22:59,953 --> 00:23:02,979
Excuse me, where is the AC-ward?

208
00:23:05,826 --> 00:23:06,884
Do you understand?

209
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:12,656
Can't you speak?

210
00:23:15,736 --> 00:23:16,862
Can't you read?

211
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,498
Idiot.

212
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,638
Brother, where is Mr.
Ramakant Pandit?

213
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:26,845
Please come with me.
- Son.

214
00:23:27,681 --> 00:23:31,276
Yes.
- Are you Dhananjay?

215
00:23:31,652 --> 00:23:34,746
Yes.
- God bless you.

216
00:23:37,691 --> 00:23:40,854
Son!
- Who is he? - I will tell you.

217
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,293
Father, what is this? You didn't
inform me about yourself..

218
00:23:43,363 --> 00:23:46,855
..for so many days and..
suddenly all this.

219
00:23:48,035 --> 00:23:51,698
Come with me right now and..
- I don't have that kind of time.

220
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:56,639
Doctor told me everything.
I need to talk to you.

221
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:02,240
Won't you say anything?
- Do you want me to say..

222
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:05,479
..that I am very happy to
know about my father?

223
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,713
Nothing has changed
in his absence.

224
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:12,919
Today, I am the same person
that I was till now.

225
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:15,787
I am the 'love child' of someone.

226
00:24:16,296 --> 00:24:20,357
Son, don't speak like that. He
wants to give you his name.

227
00:24:23,771 --> 00:24:27,764
I don't need anyone's name.
My name is Aftab.

228
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,503
My story started with this name.

229
00:24:30,577 --> 00:24:32,306
And it will end with this name.

230
00:24:33,614 --> 00:24:37,880
Mariya and I loved each
other very much.

231
00:24:38,318 --> 00:24:39,683
And we wanted to get married.

232
00:24:40,954 --> 00:24:44,788
But in those days marriage of
a Hindu boy with Muslim girl..

233
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:50,288
But still, I went to take
my father's permission..

234
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,025
..from Calcutta to Bombay.

235
00:24:53,767 --> 00:24:57,294
But the destiny.. The war between
the Indian and the Pakistan in..

236
00:24:57,371 --> 00:25:00,863
..the year 197 1 started
at the same time.

237
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,867
And one day I found Mariya's
name in the newspaper.

238
00:25:05,846 --> 00:25:10,249
I lost her and after a few I was..

239
00:25:10,317 --> 00:25:13,548
..got married to your mother.

240
00:25:14,288 --> 00:25:16,256
During the last days of the war..

241
00:25:16,323 --> 00:25:18,917
..I knew that I was
pregnant with you.

242
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,422
I went to Bombay to meet him.

243
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,257
He wasn't there, but his
wife asked me to return..

244
00:25:27,334 --> 00:25:31,532
..for the sake of their
happily married life.

245
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:36,275
And at the death-bed,
your mother told me..

246
00:25:36,343 --> 00:25:38,743
..that Mariya was alive.

247
00:25:39,947 --> 00:25:42,279
And that my son was with her.

248
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:49,282
After searching for many
days he found me.

249
00:25:49,823 --> 00:25:54,021
And since that he was requesting
to meet to you.

250
00:25:54,361 --> 00:26:00,300
And I was rejecting him.
Because I know that..

251
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:03,359
..he is the reason for your anger.

252
00:26:06,907 --> 00:26:09,842
Son, I was never afraid
of anything or anyone.

253
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,237
But when I was carrying you,
my conscience asked me..

254
00:26:15,315 --> 00:26:20,480
..if I really had the rights
to give birth to this child.

255
00:26:21,755 --> 00:26:25,748
Even though I knew that this child
will be called 'love child'..

256
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:31,256
Even though knowing these people..

257
00:26:31,331 --> 00:26:34,926
..here would question
your identity.

258
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,264
Then a voice within me told that..

259
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:43,833
..my son will prove
my decision right.

260
00:26:47,681 --> 00:26:51,845
You want me to meet him. Let's go.

261
00:26:52,686 --> 00:26:58,283
Not like this, son.
- I am not the God..

262
00:26:58,358 --> 00:27:03,955
..to forget the past within seconds.

263
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:44,488
He is the person who
destroyed our truck.

264
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,893
And he is his brother
who will do our job.

265
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:54,264
In this way the soul leaves
the body and gets a new body.

266
00:28:54,341 --> 00:29:00,280
According to the holy rituals,
the elder son..

267
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:05,785
..has to take care of everything
that belongs to him.

268
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:10,218
He has to lead the family.
And he has to accept..

269
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:15,455
..all the relations of his father
from the bottom of him heart.

270
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,222
And he heir. Now I request the
elder son to come forward..

271
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,825
..and give fire to the body.

272
00:29:31,578 --> 00:29:32,636
Priest! Give that to me.

273
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:14,882
The next Monday it's Ekadasi.

274
00:30:15,655 --> 00:30:16,781
That day is a very auspicious day.

275
00:30:16,957 --> 00:30:20,757
Come that day and immerse
the ashes in water.

276
00:30:20,961 --> 00:30:22,360
It will be very auspicious.

277
00:30:27,901 --> 00:30:30,301
Aftab. Why did you
leave that place..

278
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,304
..before the rituals were completed?

279
00:30:32,806 --> 00:30:35,036
I wanted to call Dhananjay to home.

280
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,870
You father's last wish was
that both you brothers..

281
00:30:37,944 --> 00:30:41,038
Which brother are you talking
about? And which father?

282
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:44,309
I never had a father. And
I don't have a brother.

283
00:30:44,651 --> 00:30:46,448
Son, I know that..
- You know!

284
00:30:48,688 --> 00:30:53,648
You might know that your single
decision ruined my life.

285
00:30:54,828 --> 00:30:57,319
But you don't know that what
your decision today..

286
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,557
..has done to me.

287
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:04,998
I was living my life
with all my wounds.

288
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:10,366
But today, you rubbed
the salt those wounds.

289
00:31:11,778 --> 00:31:13,871
At least I made an identity
for myself..

290
00:31:14,648 --> 00:31:16,479
That I am a 'love child' of someone.

291
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,617
Today, you have even taken
that identity from me.

292
00:31:21,788 --> 00:31:25,781
You made me a wall at which
that rich person has spitted.

293
00:31:26,693 --> 00:31:27,921
Giving fire to the body
is a Hindu ritua!.

294
00:31:27,994 --> 00:31:30,428
May be, because you are a Muslim..

295
00:31:30,497 --> 00:31:35,628
It's not about religion.
It's about rights.

296
00:31:37,904 --> 00:31:42,307
You want to know if your decision
to give birth to me..

297
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:44,969
..was right or wrong?

298
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:49,643
Then, listen to me.. You
decision was wrong.

299
00:31:52,052 --> 00:31:53,849
You should have killed
me before my birth.

300
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:35,852
What? What do you want to hear?

301
00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:37,954
That why did I taken away
the right to give the fire?

302
00:32:38,765 --> 00:32:41,666
We take the rights away from
those who have rights.

303
00:32:41,735 --> 00:32:43,896
It's your father who said that..

304
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,801
That he made a mistake
when he was young.

305
00:32:45,872 --> 00:32:49,899
Aftab and his mother are a mistake
in my father's life.

306
00:32:49,976 --> 00:32:53,878
How can you turn away from such
a big truth of your life?

307
00:32:54,714 --> 00:32:57,911
They are your own people.
- Ragini, please..

308
00:32:58,451 --> 00:33:01,818
Stop your philosophy.
Don't disturb me more.

309
00:33:02,589 --> 00:33:03,613
Where did you come from?

310
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,748
Sir, I came from the orphanage.

311
00:33:04,824 --> 00:33:07,657
How did you come inside?
- Sir, the door was open.

312
00:33:07,727 --> 00:33:11,288
Is there anyone? Ashok! Shut up.

313
00:33:11,665 --> 00:33:13,656
Every second person is trying
to enter my life.

314
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:14,791
You go out of my house right now.

315
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,768
Don't you feel ashamed to come
here like this? - Sir. - Jai.

316
00:33:16,836 --> 00:33:18,667
Get out.
- Sir, the donation.

317
00:33:18,738 --> 00:33:20,569
I don't have any money..

318
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:27,007
What are you thinking?

319
00:33:27,614 --> 00:33:30,276
You are thinking that this
sir has such a big house..

320
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,284
..but he doesn't have any money?

321
00:33:32,352 --> 00:33:34,411
You can think that. Because
the whole world thinks that.

322
00:33:34,487 --> 00:33:36,819
Dhananjay Pandit has everything.

323
00:33:37,023 --> 00:33:39,685
A big house, A.C. car,
a beautiful girlfriend.

324
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:42,694
But you want to hear the truth?
Then listen to me.

325
00:33:42,762 --> 00:33:47,461
Everything that belongs to me
is mortgaged in the bank.

326
00:33:47,534 --> 00:33:50,765
Do you know why? I need one
contract. Just one contract.

327
00:33:50,837 --> 00:33:53,305
For which I am working day
and night since five years.

328
00:33:53,373 --> 00:33:57,332
..for which I have everything
at stake. Did you get me?

329
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,641
Now you do one thing.
Come after two days.

330
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,783
If I get that contract, I will
build an orphanage for you.

331
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,917
But if I don't, then I will
come with you for begging.

332
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,754
Now you take this and go.
- Thank you, sir.

333
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,496
Do you know what you were doing?

334
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:27,506
You were discussing your life,
your bank balance with a kid.

335
00:34:27,574 --> 00:34:29,872
Are you mad?
- Yes, of course, I have become mad.

336
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,434
But you don't understand
my problem, Ragini.

337
00:34:32,512 --> 00:34:34,275
If that British rejects
the proposal,..

338
00:34:34,347 --> 00:34:36,281
..then what am I going to do?

339
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:38,317
And then I've to bear
your philosophy too.

340
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:41,276
What was that! Why are you
so afraid of hatred?

341
00:34:41,354 --> 00:34:43,288
Here I am going though
so much tension..

342
00:34:43,356 --> 00:34:44,687
..and you are trying
to philosophize me.

343
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,920
I am not mad. The
whole world is mad.

344
00:35:11,251 --> 00:35:15,278
''Your youth and my youth."

345
00:35:15,588 --> 00:35:18,751
''A union of both will
create our love story."

346
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:22,761
''Your youth and my youth."

347
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:26,765
''A union of both will
create a love story."

348
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,768
''This fire of heart will be doused.''

349
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:33,762
''This fire of heart will be doused.''

350
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,641
''Let us have rains this year."

351
00:35:38,711 --> 00:35:42,647
''Your youth and my youth."

352
00:35:42,715 --> 00:35:46,776
''A union of both will
create our love story."

353
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,515
''A love story.."

354
00:36:07,774 --> 00:36:11,642
''Play with my tresses."

355
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:15,738
''Let my kohl be strewn."

356
00:36:15,815 --> 00:36:18,807
''You have all my permission."

357
00:36:19,586 --> 00:36:23,283
''This is love, my dear!"

358
00:36:23,857 --> 00:36:27,258
''I feel coy.."

359
00:36:27,327 --> 00:36:31,627
''..but why should I feel
coy in front of you?''

360
00:36:31,698 --> 00:36:34,258
''I am not at fault.."

361
00:36:34,334 --> 00:36:38,896
''..that I have become
crazy in your love."

362
00:36:39,606 --> 00:36:43,770
''Your youth and my youth."

363
00:36:43,843 --> 00:36:47,438
''A union of both will
create our love story."

364
00:36:47,614 --> 00:36:50,583
''A love story."

365
00:37:06,466 --> 00:37:10,698
''Even if you light
up the fire in me."

366
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,729
''Douse the fire of the heart.''

367
00:37:14,974 --> 00:37:18,239
''The romantic ambience.."

368
00:37:18,311 --> 00:37:22,247
''..have set my lips afire."

369
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:25,248
''Touch me and see.. ''

370
00:37:25,318 --> 00:37:30,449
''..there are embers
within the dewdrops."

371
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:38,587
''This pain is new albeit
the wound is old."

372
00:37:38,665 --> 00:37:42,726
''Your youth and my youth."

373
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:46,738
''A union of both will
create our love story."

374
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,468
''A love story."

375
00:37:50,777 --> 00:37:53,940
Stop it, Ragini. Leave me alone.

376
00:37:54,447 --> 00:37:55,778
Go from here.

377
00:37:59,786 --> 00:38:00,844
Damn it!

378
00:38:04,257 --> 00:38:07,715
''This heart is crazy in your love.''

379
00:38:07,794 --> 00:38:11,730
''This isn't anger but
just a mere excuse."

380
00:38:12,632 --> 00:38:15,829
''I am not angry with you.''

381
00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:18,833
''Nor am I separate from you."

382
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,231
''Doesn't matter what I express.."

383
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:27,712
''..I am broken within"

384
00:38:27,981 --> 00:38:30,245
''Come close to me.."

385
00:38:30,316 --> 00:38:35,720
''..I want to feel you.''

386
00:38:36,255 --> 00:38:39,782
''Your youth and my youth."

387
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:43,761
''A union of both will
create our love story."

388
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:47,493
''This fire of heart will be doused.''

389
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:50,827
''This fire of heart will be doused.''

390
00:38:50,903 --> 00:38:55,397
''Let us have rains this year."

391
00:38:55,642 --> 00:38:59,669
''Your youth and my youth."

392
00:38:59,746 --> 00:39:03,204
''A union of both will
create our love story."

393
00:39:03,282 --> 00:39:06,308
''A love story."

394
00:39:25,772 --> 00:39:26,830
Come here.

395
00:39:35,815 --> 00:39:37,442
Yes.
- Hello, Dhananjay.

396
00:39:37,517 --> 00:39:40,281
Yes, who are you?
- I am Aftab speaking.

397
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,245
I need to talk to you about
something important.

398
00:39:44,323 --> 00:39:45,984
I can't talk to you right now.

399
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,924
Give me your number,
I will call you back.

400
00:39:49,996 --> 00:39:52,760
I can't give you my number.
- But why?

401
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,823
Because I am in jail.

402
00:39:58,871 --> 00:40:03,467
I need your help. Can
you come here tomorrow?

403
00:40:03,543 --> 00:40:06,808
No. I am very busy. I can't come.

404
00:40:06,879 --> 00:40:13,011
Dhananjay. I am in a lot of trouble.
- It's your problem. I can't come.

405
00:40:13,352 --> 00:40:14,842
Try to understand.

406
00:40:15,688 --> 00:40:19,021
I wouldn't have called you
if I had other option.

407
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:23,689
Now the decision is up to you.

408
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,905
Jai, relax.

409
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,437
Hey, soldier. So many
days have passed.

410
00:40:39,512 --> 00:40:44,415
What are you doing? The goods
haven't reached here.

411
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:48,309
The government has fixed
a special commission..

412
00:40:48,387 --> 00:40:50,821
..for the smuggling at the border.

413
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:53,688
I don't care about your problem.

414
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:59,924
I have paid the money
totally in advance.

415
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,263
Yes I know, but I need..

416
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,769
We need some time.

417
00:41:05,605 --> 00:41:09,268
Soldier! You government
officials are not..

418
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:13,836
..honest even in the
jobs of dishonesty.

419
00:41:14,814 --> 00:41:16,782
I will do something about it soon.

420
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:20,285
The person who won't do anything..

421
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:25,757
I never forgive that person.

422
00:41:26,793 --> 00:41:28,021
I hope you got me.

423
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,886
Jaswant.

424
00:41:36,803 --> 00:41:38,293
Come on.

425
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:46,041
Do you want to meet Aftab?
- Yes.

426
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:53,385
He is not at the home.
- Where is he?

427
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:55,820
Come with me.

428
00:42:06,866 --> 00:42:08,493
You said that you were in the jail.

429
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:09,899
I couldn't say everything
to you on phone.

430
00:42:11,671 --> 00:42:15,004
At least tell me now that
why have you called me?

431
00:42:18,778 --> 00:42:20,678
I have destroyed someone's goods.

432
00:42:21,681 --> 00:42:23,512
And that caused a lot
of losses to them.

433
00:42:24,784 --> 00:42:28,311
And they want me to..
- Ok, I got it.

434
00:42:28,821 --> 00:42:30,880
So this drama was for money.

435
00:42:31,657 --> 00:42:32,715
Tell me how much money you want.

436
00:42:32,792 --> 00:42:36,819
5,000! 10,000! 15,000!
- The goods were worth 50 lakhs.

437
00:42:37,697 --> 00:42:43,294
What! 50 lakhs! I don't have
my ancestor's property.

438
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:45,428
Whatever I have, I have
earned it myself.

439
00:42:47,974 --> 00:42:49,703
I don't need your money.

440
00:42:50,476 --> 00:42:52,034
Bring a thing that belongs to me.

441
00:42:53,713 --> 00:42:55,908
There is a cupboard
behind the hospital.

442
00:42:56,716 --> 00:42:58,843
There is a bag on it. Please
bring that bag to me.

443
00:42:58,918 --> 00:43:01,318
Are you mad? I don't what you do.

444
00:43:04,757 --> 00:43:06,725
Why should I get into this?
- Listen.

445
00:43:08,728 --> 00:43:09,956
My mother's life is in danger.

446
00:43:10,997 --> 00:43:13,465
And I can't trust anyone
else other than you.

447
00:43:15,768 --> 00:43:19,499
But what's there in that bag?
- There is nothing to worry.

448
00:43:19,939 --> 00:43:23,875
There are valuable things in that.
- But..

449
00:43:25,745 --> 00:43:27,645
I will clear all your queries later.

450
00:43:27,947 --> 00:43:31,849
I am running out of time.
Please bring that bag.

451
00:43:34,787 --> 00:43:37,779
And trust me, nothing
will happen to you.

452
00:44:55,434 --> 00:44:56,492
Why?

453
00:44:56,936 --> 00:44:58,870
You said that there was nothing.

454
00:44:58,938 --> 00:45:03,375
Look at this. There
was a dead body.

455
00:45:03,442 --> 00:45:05,569
Somebody has been
murdered. You..

456
00:45:06,779 --> 00:45:09,748
I came here to help you and
you put me into troubles.

457
00:45:09,815 --> 00:45:11,407
You showed me what you are.

458
00:45:12,985 --> 00:45:17,786
Why did you do this to me?
Tell me what do you want?

459
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:22,254
I shouldn't have trusted you.
There was a gun in my hand..

460
00:45:22,328 --> 00:45:26,822
And someone took my photo.
Don't touch me. - Stop.

461
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,506
They have done this to mother.

462
00:45:47,686 --> 00:45:51,747
If I didn't call you, they would
have cut one finger daily.

463
00:45:53,759 --> 00:45:55,283
I didn't have any other option.

464
00:45:56,695 --> 00:45:59,027
I can do anything for my mother.

465
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,296
Not only if you..

466
00:46:04,737 --> 00:46:07,604
Listen stop talking.

467
00:46:14,413 --> 00:46:15,471
Come with me.

468
00:46:40,773 --> 00:46:41,831
Come.

469
00:47:17,643 --> 00:47:21,704
Who is that person? - Don't worry.
Listen to me carefully.

470
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,544
I just want to know that
why have you called me.

471
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,479
What do you want from me?

472
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:28,850
Justice Swarabji came here
to attend the meeting.

473
00:47:29,588 --> 00:47:33,490
And after the meeting, he will
go to Delhi in his car.

474
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:38,458
You have to keep this
packet in his car.

475
00:47:38,664 --> 00:47:40,256
What's there in this packet?

476
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:42,499
There is a letter and
some money in it.

477
00:47:42,668 --> 00:47:46,399
In business language,
this is called bribe.

478
00:47:46,472 --> 00:47:48,269
Are you mad? The whole
country knows..

479
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,808
..that this judge
doesn't take bribe.

480
00:47:50,876 --> 00:47:54,004
Everyone takes bribe, but they
take it in different forms.

481
00:47:55,314 --> 00:47:58,841
You keep this packet in his car.
He'll understand the rest.

482
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:00,283
Why don't you do that?

483
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:04,683
Because justice Swarabji
has Z-security force.

484
00:48:05,891 --> 00:48:07,791
We can't reach there.
- No one can reach there.

485
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:12,229
You can reach there and
we know it very well.

486
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:19,932
Who is that person?
- Do what you are asked to do.

487
00:48:27,646 --> 00:48:28,977
So you have done your home work.

488
00:48:29,648 --> 00:48:33,709
I don't know who you are,
but I won't do this.

489
00:48:36,589 --> 00:48:39,387
You will definitely do it.

490
00:49:04,717 --> 00:49:06,810
Excuse me, sit. Would you
like to give any statement?

491
00:49:06,885 --> 00:49:11,219
Yes. The weapons that should
attack the enemy have..

492
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:12,621
..got rust.

493
00:49:12,691 --> 00:49:15,819
- Are you indicating towards
the officials?

494
00:49:15,894 --> 00:49:18,886
You are right. Our officials
are our weapons.

495
00:49:18,964 --> 00:49:23,731
But some of our senior officials
have sold themselves.

496
00:49:23,802 --> 00:49:26,737
If you doubt our officials, won't
it be demoralizing to them.

497
00:49:26,805 --> 00:49:28,238
Our morale will be high..

498
00:49:28,307 --> 00:49:30,241
..when the corrupted officials
will be traced out.

499
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:31,606
Nobody is just saying
like that only.

500
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:34,612
All the records about
them are in this file.

501
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,240
I am going to Delhi and within 24
hours I will find the truth..

502
00:49:37,316 --> 00:49:39,250
..and I'll present that
in front of the

503
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:40,979
..parliamentary committee. Enough.

504
00:50:00,306 --> 00:50:01,739
Tell me where did you send him?

505
00:50:03,942 --> 00:50:05,773
Please come.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

506
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:20,826
Justice Swarabji.
- Mr. Dhananjay Pandit.

507
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,521
Am I correct?
- Yes, sir.

508
00:50:23,595 --> 00:50:26,359
What are you doing here?
- I came here for you, sir.

509
00:50:26,799 --> 00:50:31,793
Me. It's alright. I know him. So..

510
00:50:33,706 --> 00:50:37,301
Sir, I'm making a documentary film
on the present conditions..

511
00:50:37,376 --> 00:50:41,642
..of India and you are the
hero of this film. - Me?

512
00:50:42,715 --> 00:50:43,773
Come.

513
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,311
I want to make the film about
the way you are fighting..

514
00:50:50,389 --> 00:50:53,324
..corruption. I want to
show how a person..

515
00:50:53,392 --> 00:50:55,326
..collecting the information
against the corruption..

516
00:50:55,394 --> 00:50:57,919
..from different parts
of the country.

517
00:50:58,731 --> 00:51:01,325
My camera will follow
your car everywhere..

518
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,428
So that I could show every
aspect about you.

519
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,260
Sir, the people like you..

520
00:51:06,338 --> 00:51:08,806
..are the role model for the
youth of this country.

521
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:11,876
I really appreciate you.
- I am with you.

522
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:14,310
But right now, I am in a hurry.
I need to reach Delhi. Ok.

523
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:15,705
Thank you, sir.

524
00:51:56,922 --> 00:51:59,720
Bhakta. He won't listen
to me like that.

525
00:52:02,761 --> 00:52:06,492
I've told you many times that
that person was in darkness.

526
00:52:06,765 --> 00:52:09,757
I haven't seen his face.
I haven't heard him. I..

527
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:13,771
Why would I lie? Search
him whom I have seen.

528
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,501
Stop your drama. Leave me.

529
00:52:20,779 --> 00:52:25,773
Tell me, who gave you that bomb.

530
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:28,911
What are you doing? I want
to make call to Bombay.

531
00:52:28,987 --> 00:52:30,955
I want to talk to my lawyer.

532
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:36,525
Don't try to threaten
me with your money.

533
00:52:36,829 --> 00:52:40,287
This is the border. Here, I am
the lawyer, I am the judge..

534
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:42,333
..and I am the executioner.

535
00:52:42,401 --> 00:52:43,868
Then why are you harassing me?

536
00:52:43,936 --> 00:52:45,369
Then search that guy..

537
00:52:59,985 --> 00:53:04,354
What will you say now?

538
00:53:05,924 --> 00:53:07,983
Now I will tell you..

539
00:53:08,861 --> 00:53:12,922
You and your brother, Mariya's son.

540
00:53:13,799 --> 00:53:18,896
Both of you were trading the
explosives in this area.

541
00:53:22,941 --> 00:53:26,274
He is the illiterate of
this place and you..

542
00:53:26,345 --> 00:53:30,748
The educated one from the city.
Nice team! Nice team!

543
00:53:30,816 --> 00:53:32,875
I have got nothing to do with him.

544
00:53:32,951 --> 00:53:35,419
He is the one who dragged
me into this trouble.

545
00:53:35,687 --> 00:53:37,314
Why don't you talk to him?

546
00:53:37,656 --> 00:53:41,786
I will also talk to him.
Bhakta, call him.

547
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,487
There is no need to call.

548
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:56,036
You are here. I know
everything about you.

549
00:53:56,708 --> 00:53:58,539
I have got the record of yours.

550
00:53:59,978 --> 00:54:01,639
You have a lot of pride, don't you?

551
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:07,818
You are the betrayers
of the country.

552
00:54:08,587 --> 00:54:10,521
You have become a burden on us.

553
00:54:10,923 --> 00:54:12,515
Do you think that you
are very powerful?

554
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:16,726
Now show me your power.

555
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:20,296
Ugly people. Ugly blood.

556
00:54:36,949 --> 00:54:42,683
Why are you staring at
me? Look downwards.

557
00:55:07,813 --> 00:55:08,871
Put your weapons down.

558
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,373
I said, put your weapons down.
- No.

559
00:55:12,451 --> 00:55:16,251
No one will listen to him.

560
00:55:23,762 --> 00:55:27,254
Dhananjay. Take the gun.
- Aftab.

561
00:55:27,633 --> 00:55:29,965
Take the gun.
- Jesus.

562
00:55:33,672 --> 00:55:35,663
Come on. Go. Come on, move.

563
00:55:35,741 --> 00:55:39,734
Go inside. Go.

564
00:55:50,856 --> 00:55:54,485
Oh! Shit. He is too much.

565
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:03,292
Dhananjay.

566
00:56:46,845 --> 00:56:50,804
Come. Vaikunth!
- And who are you? - I am from CBI.

567
00:56:51,683 --> 00:56:53,844
Assistant director Manohar
Singh Jadeja.

568
00:56:53,919 --> 00:56:55,887
So? What should we do?

569
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:59,685
I am here for the investigation
of the murder of Mr. Swarabji.

570
00:56:59,758 --> 00:57:01,555
What will you investigate about?

571
00:57:04,229 --> 00:57:05,526
The case is very clear.

572
00:57:06,732 --> 00:57:09,826
Both the brothers joined their
hands with the terrorists.

573
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,796
They felt that Mr. Swarabji
may punish them.

574
00:57:12,871 --> 00:57:14,634
That's why they killed him.

575
00:57:16,274 --> 00:57:18,799
They even agreed to that
while questioning.

576
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:22,308
But still I want to talk to them.

577
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,280
Both of them ran away
from this place.

578
00:57:26,718 --> 00:57:29,846
So you are waiting for them?
- No..

579
00:57:30,589 --> 00:57:33,717
These villagers have
become very naughty.

580
00:57:34,593 --> 00:57:37,289
They have kept the gun on Mr.
Vaikunth's head and escaped.

581
00:57:37,362 --> 00:57:40,490
When the radio gets repaired, I
will inform all the check posts.

582
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:44,999
I want to check the report of
investigation and the FlR.

583
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:50,004
You might have forgotten that
this case is mine too.

584
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:52,836
I already told you that I have
investigated completely.

585
00:57:52,911 --> 00:57:56,813
Mr. Vaikunth, I am
just doing my job.

586
00:58:02,721 --> 00:58:05,781
Do you know this has become
a very big case?

587
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:08,951
They have accused of
being a terrorist.

588
00:58:09,261 --> 00:58:12,560
A judge has been killed. Why
are you doing this to me?

589
00:58:12,631 --> 00:58:14,826
I didn't know that there was
the bomb in that packet.

590
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:19,269
Stop. Let me go.
- We need to get out of this place.

591
00:58:19,337 --> 00:58:22,238
I don't know anything.
I just know that..

592
00:58:22,307 --> 00:58:25,367
..if I stay with you, I will
be killed by someone.

593
00:58:25,443 --> 00:58:27,809
Try to understand.
- There is no use in running, Aftab.

594
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:28,971
Stop the bike.

595
00:58:36,922 --> 00:58:39,390
Moron.

596
00:58:39,624 --> 00:58:45,995
Oh! Shit. What will we
do now? Where are we?

597
00:58:47,666 --> 00:58:50,499
I have to reach Bombay. I
need to talk to my lawyer.

598
00:58:50,936 --> 00:58:52,631
Do you know..

599
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,832
Do you know who a lawyer is?

600
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,273
A person who wears a black coat..

601
00:58:58,343 --> 00:59:02,575
..who takes all your money,
but rescues from problems.

602
00:59:02,647 --> 00:59:05,741
Who stopped you? You can go.

603
00:59:05,817 --> 00:59:09,218
But how can I go? Do you
think that anyone hear..

604
00:59:09,287 --> 00:59:11,255
..knows what a taxi is? Excuse me.

605
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:13,951
Can somebody get
me a taxi, please?

606
00:59:14,626 --> 00:59:18,357
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!

607
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:21,831
Why are you shouting, taxi?
Shout 'plane'.

608
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:25,358
You may get that.
- shut up, Aftab. This is too much.

609
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:28,235
I need to reach Bombay. I've
the most important meeting..

610
00:59:28,306 --> 00:59:31,241
..of my life and..
- Till I repair this bike..

611
00:59:31,309 --> 00:59:34,574
..you order something from the
hotel. - I don't want to eat.

612
00:59:34,646 --> 00:59:38,707
I should reach Bombay
right now. Okay.

613
00:59:38,884 --> 00:59:40,249
Then do one thing. Start
walking to your left.

614
00:59:41,653 --> 00:59:42,847
You will reach there
within 8-10 months.

615
00:59:42,921 --> 00:59:44,980
But if you want to eat,
then order it over there.

616
00:59:46,424 --> 00:59:48,790
You know, you are
an obnoxious fool.

617
00:59:50,762 --> 00:59:53,458
Order the Dal-plate for me.

618
00:59:53,665 --> 00:59:56,600
And one more thing. Wash
your face before eating.

619
00:59:58,937 --> 01:00:00,928
Oh! Jesus.

620
01:00:03,875 --> 01:00:06,673
What are you doing here?
Bring the curd.

621
01:00:07,779 --> 01:00:09,838
Sir, the caravan group is here.

622
01:00:09,915 --> 01:00:12,816
Then cut it into pieces
and cook it properly.

623
01:00:13,618 --> 01:00:15,677
Sir, the caravan group.
The group that dances.

624
01:00:15,754 --> 01:00:17,688
Those who dance. Wow!

625
01:00:17,756 --> 01:00:22,284
That means tonight there
will be celebrations.

626
01:00:22,794 --> 01:00:24,625
Brother, will I get
something to eat?

627
01:00:24,696 --> 01:00:26,687
Dance? It is about to start.

628
01:00:26,765 --> 01:00:30,701
Food.
- Wait for a moment.

629
01:00:30,769 --> 01:00:32,794
Tonight there will be celebrations.

630
01:00:33,638 --> 01:00:36,436
Whatever! Put less pepper in it.

631
01:00:37,809 --> 01:00:43,679
Serve the food. - Sir, please
come here. Please sit here.

632
01:00:43,815 --> 01:00:49,720
You watch the song and I will
bring the food for you.

633
01:00:50,488 --> 01:00:53,889
Here it is. Drink and watch.
Watch and drink.

634
01:00:53,959 --> 01:00:55,859
What a song!

635
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:58,996
Let it start.

636
01:01:17,482 --> 01:01:22,613
''Love is just a drop of water.."

637
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:32,295
''..which contains a storm within.''

638
01:01:32,931 --> 01:01:39,302
''Place your heart in one hand..''

639
01:01:40,972 --> 01:01:47,309
''..place your life on another."

640
01:02:10,902 --> 01:02:15,965
''Not only your heart it demands
your life as well"

641
01:02:16,641 --> 01:02:21,601
''Not only your heart it demands
your life as well"

642
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:26,776
''Only a few can pass through
the lane of love."

643
01:02:26,851 --> 01:02:31,288
''Only a few can pass through
the lane of love."

644
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:53,869
''Just the way the ascetics are
obsessed with renunciation.''

645
01:02:54,646 --> 01:02:59,310
''In the like manner lovers
get possessed with love."

646
01:03:04,756 --> 01:03:08,886
''Just the way the ascetics are
obsessed with renunciation.''

647
01:03:09,594 --> 01:03:13,826
''In the like manner lovers
get possessed with love."

648
01:03:14,432 --> 01:03:18,869
''No matter how much
one tries in vain."

649
01:03:18,937 --> 01:03:24,273
''No matter how much
one tries in vain."

650
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:29,878
''A lover gets coloured with
the shade of love."

651
01:03:30,782 --> 01:03:36,652
''A lover gets coloured with
the shade of love."

652
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:41,622
''Only a few can pass through
the lane of love."

653
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:46,630
''Only a few can pass through
the lane of love."

654
01:04:06,918 --> 01:04:12,515
''I am known for my craze of love."

655
01:04:13,758 --> 01:04:20,254
''There is no other
identity of mine."

656
01:04:21,766 --> 01:04:26,601
''I am known for my craze of love
and not by any other identity."

657
01:04:26,671 --> 01:04:31,506
''There is nothing more
notorious than love.''

658
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:35,876
''There is no bigger allegation
than that of love.''

659
01:04:36,614 --> 01:04:41,278
''There is no bigger allegation
than that of love.''

660
01:04:43,788 --> 01:04:47,849
''Love can even sentence
the lovers to death.''

661
01:04:48,459 --> 01:04:53,829
''Love can even sentence
the lovers to death.''

662
01:04:54,365 --> 01:04:59,029
''Only a few can pass through
the lane of love."

663
01:04:59,704 --> 01:05:03,731
''Only a few can pass through
the lane of love."

664
01:05:18,756 --> 01:05:22,283
Hey, where are you going,
girl? Come with me.

665
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:27,764
What are you doing? Leave her.
- Leave her.

666
01:05:27,832 --> 01:05:29,766
What kind of people come
to your restaurant?

667
01:05:30,602 --> 01:05:32,263
He spoiled my mood.

668
01:05:34,772 --> 01:05:39,869
You take this. Please go.

669
01:05:43,781 --> 01:05:49,481
Aftab! Aftab!

670
01:05:54,692 --> 01:05:55,818
Aftab!

671
01:05:58,429 --> 01:06:00,795
You were trying to be
a hero over there.

672
01:06:15,647 --> 01:06:16,807
Leave him.

673
01:06:23,755 --> 01:06:25,382
You ugly blood!

674
01:06:31,729 --> 01:06:34,493
What did you say? Say it again.

675
01:06:34,565 --> 01:06:38,331
What else should I say?
You ugly blood!

676
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:12,601
What all this?
- It's mud. It will absorb the heat.

677
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:15,833
Then you should put it on
your head. It's very hot.

678
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:17,738
Do you think that you are a doctor?

679
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:20,870
You've put the mud all over my body.

680
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:25,580
This stuff stinks, man.

681
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:26,912
You won't understand
the importance of it.

682
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:28,817
Take this. Drink it.
It will give energy.

683
01:07:28,886 --> 01:07:32,253
Is this mineral water.
- It's Shorba. - What?

684
01:07:32,323 --> 01:07:34,848
It's shoup. In English,
they call in Shoup.

685
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:39,324
It's not Shoup. It's soup.
- Yes, that is it.

686
01:07:40,665 --> 01:07:43,259
Just taste it and see.

687
01:07:47,739 --> 01:07:51,869
Wow! It's amazing.
- You didn't like it?

688
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:54,639
It's very tasty. It's better
than Chicken soup.

689
01:07:54,712 --> 01:07:56,441
What is it made of?
- The frog.

690
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:04,915
The frog! - Yes, I didn't get mouse
in this jungle. - You are..

691
01:08:06,758 --> 01:08:09,591
Come fast. Or else the lady frog
will come to take revenge.

692
01:08:24,342 --> 01:08:25,900
Will you kill me or what?

693
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:31,945
You want to go to Bombay and I
want to get out of this place.

694
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:35,378
And I don't have time
to talk rubbish.

695
01:08:35,453 --> 01:08:36,852
I don't even want to talk to you.

696
01:08:37,588 --> 01:08:40,785
You sour man. Since
you entered my life..

697
01:08:40,858 --> 01:08:42,257
Sometimes there is blood.
Sometimes there are..

698
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:43,725
..dead bodies, bomb blasts..

699
01:08:43,795 --> 01:08:46,855
Keep quiet for some time.
- You don't like my voice?

700
01:08:47,598 --> 01:08:49,429
I don't like your face.

701
01:08:56,808 --> 01:08:59,299
Stop, signal, ok, thank you, tata.

702
01:08:59,644 --> 01:09:01,612
The person with evil
eye will suffer.

703
01:09:01,879 --> 01:09:05,212
You're a crooked person. You
want to escape from police..

704
01:09:05,283 --> 01:09:08,343
..and you don't care about
the rest of the people.

705
01:09:11,823 --> 01:09:15,520
You would have got killed, if
I didn't save you at the hotel.

706
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:18,228
So you saved me? You are
the one who dragged me..

707
01:09:18,296 --> 01:09:22,960
..into this trouble, otherwise,
I wouldn't have come.

708
01:09:24,635 --> 01:09:25,693
Did you forget it?

709
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:28,637
Hello. Dhananjay! l am in a lot
of trouble. I am in trouble.

710
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:32,608
Help me. I need you.
I had mercy on you.

711
01:09:34,745 --> 01:09:37,339
You got into trouble because
you are a rich man.

712
01:09:38,616 --> 01:09:40,914
Your dress, your money has
put you into trouble.

713
01:09:41,652 --> 01:09:45,645
They needed a person like
you to reach Swarabji.

714
01:09:47,758 --> 01:09:52,252
You envy me, at my wealth,
at my success.

715
01:09:52,330 --> 01:09:56,494
..at my identity. Because
of my father.

716
01:10:11,616 --> 01:10:13,675
Get down.

717
01:10:16,954 --> 01:10:19,855
What' the matter, sir? Are you
looking for the terrorists?

718
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:22,688
Do you think that I don't
have anything else to do?

719
01:10:23,327 --> 01:10:24,885
I am doing the routine checking.

720
01:10:24,962 --> 01:10:30,662
Truck no. RJS 2732.

721
01:10:30,735 --> 01:10:32,327
- What's there in it?

722
01:10:32,637 --> 01:10:35,538
Nothing, sir. - This is an ugly
truck. There is nothing in it.

723
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:38,905
You keep quiet. You open it.
- Sir.

724
01:10:39,977 --> 01:10:42,309
What? - There is information
from the headquarters..

725
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:44,905
..that two terrorists have
escaped on a truck.

726
01:10:46,684 --> 01:10:48,584
So what? They won't come here.

727
01:10:48,653 --> 01:10:51,713
Till now, no one entered
Premnath Chaubey's area.

728
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:54,314
No one. - Anyway! Did they
give the truck number..

729
01:10:54,392 --> 01:10:57,452
..or their identities?
- Sir, I forgot the truck number.

730
01:10:57,695 --> 01:11:00,323
And about their identities, they
said that one is a Pathan..

731
01:11:00,398 --> 01:11:02,889
..and another is a British,
and then the radio damaged.

732
01:11:11,742 --> 01:11:13,642
Have you seen them?

733
01:11:14,779 --> 01:11:19,648
No.
- I don't know where they are.

734
01:11:19,717 --> 01:11:21,878
You don't know, sir.
- You sit at the radio.

735
01:11:22,353 --> 01:11:25,288
Show me the truck.
- Come.

736
01:11:28,459 --> 01:11:29,517
Check it.

737
01:11:36,634 --> 01:11:38,295
Constable.
- Yes, sir.

738
01:11:38,803 --> 01:11:40,031
Check, what is inside?

739
01:11:42,373 --> 01:11:44,705
Nothing, sir. The truck is empty.

740
01:11:44,775 --> 01:11:47,869
Ok, let the truck go.

741
01:11:48,813 --> 01:11:50,804
O no!

742
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:26,340
Mariya!
- Greetings.

743
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:32,176
Did you have any news of Aftab?
- Not till now.

744
01:12:33,116 --> 01:12:35,949
Have patience! Have faith in Allah!

745
01:12:36,219 --> 01:12:38,687
But he doesn't have faith in Allah.

746
01:12:41,658 --> 01:12:46,618
Everything is in His hands.
And when He will wish..

747
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:50,359
..you son will come to Him.

748
01:12:55,238 --> 01:12:56,296
What do you think? What
will happen now?

749
01:12:58,174 --> 01:12:59,801
Whatever should
happen, will happen.

750
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:03,679
I think we should tell everything
to the authorities.

751
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,048
Yes, we should tell everything.

752
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:07,582
That how your mother
was kidnapped..

753
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:10,619
..which forced you to
call me to Rajasthan.

754
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,252
And the conspiracy to kill
Swarabji. Everything!

755
01:13:14,324 --> 01:13:19,626
I knew them very well. They're
just looking for a Scapegoat.

756
01:13:19,929 --> 01:13:22,591
Now this matter belongs to both
of us. And if you ask..

757
01:13:22,665 --> 01:13:25,998
..help of the government,
it shouldn't hurt your ego.

758
01:13:27,003 --> 01:13:28,834
You want to save yourself?

759
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:32,671
Then go and ask the help of
the constable like a chick.

760
01:13:34,677 --> 01:13:36,838
Go and hide behind
your father's name.

761
01:13:40,283 --> 01:13:45,277
Where are they? - Come here, sir.
I have caught both of them.

762
01:13:48,024 --> 01:13:53,326
What were you doing outside?
Let's go.

763
01:14:33,269 --> 01:14:38,605
Stop. Surrender or I will shoot.

764
01:14:41,678 --> 01:14:43,612
Come.

765
01:14:46,115 --> 01:14:49,949
I am CBI officer Jadeja.
This case is under me.

766
01:14:50,019 --> 01:14:52,112
Now you surrender yourself.

767
01:14:52,188 --> 01:14:55,885
Sir, we are innocent.
- I know it.

768
01:14:55,959 --> 01:14:59,554
I am ready to help both
of you but first of all..

769
01:14:59,629 --> 01:15:03,588
Surrender yourself to me. Come.

770
01:15:08,104 --> 01:15:11,039
What are you doing?
- You can't kill me.

771
01:15:11,107 --> 01:15:13,974
I have already killed one person.
- But he was alive.

772
01:15:14,944 --> 01:15:16,036
He didn't die because of you.

773
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:19,972
He was lucky that he didn't die.

774
01:15:20,049 --> 01:15:22,574
I know why you shot at him..

775
01:15:24,087 --> 01:15:27,955
Because I know everything
about you are your mother.

776
01:15:29,092 --> 01:15:30,218
No, Aftab.

777
01:15:34,097 --> 01:15:38,261
Trust me. Justice will
be done with you.

778
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:45,638
Have you seen it? This
is your justice.

779
01:15:49,812 --> 01:15:52,975
Don't fire.

780
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:55,918
Stop. Don't fire.

781
01:17:31,047 --> 01:17:33,140
What have you done?
Have you gone mad?

782
01:17:33,216 --> 01:17:35,081
You are the one who gets mad.

783
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:38,917
I don't know what happens to
you. You shoot at people.

784
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:40,580
I threw that gun because ..

785
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:43,090
..I don't want to get
into trouble with you.

786
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:48,588
Nothing will happen to you.
- It's not just about me..

787
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:50,325
It's about both of..

788
01:18:02,211 --> 01:18:05,942
Bhakta. Check what's the next
station of this train?

789
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:09,142
If we listen to CBI, we will
have to lose our jobs.

790
01:18:09,218 --> 01:18:11,550
Mr. Vaikunth, I came here
to find the root of..

791
01:18:11,621 --> 01:18:15,921
..Mr. Swarabji's death, but
not to show my bravery.

792
01:18:15,992 --> 01:18:18,961
Now I have doubts on your
intentions, Mr. Jadeja.

793
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:21,895
I will report to the headquarters.
- What report?

794
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,936
It seems that your intentions
are not right, Mr. Vaikunth.

795
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:38,069
It seems that you want to
kill them at any cost.

796
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:42,945
You are crossing your
limits, Mr. Jadeja.

797
01:18:43,653 --> 01:18:45,746
You can't doubt my intentions.

798
01:18:46,322 --> 01:18:50,918
No terrorist will throw his gun
like this. What do you think?

799
01:18:51,627 --> 01:18:52,992
That's what I too think.

800
01:18:54,197 --> 01:18:55,528
But if he is innocent..

801
01:18:55,598 --> 01:19:00,865
..then who is troubling
them. Let's go.

802
01:19:13,282 --> 01:19:15,546
Do you have any pin?
- Pin.

803
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:20,112
After running with you, I even
forgot my house pin number.

804
01:19:20,189 --> 01:19:24,683
Do you have nay pen?
- Hold on.

805
01:19:26,963 --> 01:19:31,093
Will it work? This is a tie-pin.

806
01:19:31,167 --> 01:19:34,762
This is used to attach the tie
with the shirt. - I know it.

807
01:19:40,743 --> 01:19:43,678
It seems that you're habituated
to open the locks in this way.

808
01:19:44,313 --> 01:19:47,805
Sorry. Peace brother. No fighting.

809
01:19:50,086 --> 01:19:52,953
Hey, you fool. This is
the gift from my love.

810
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:57,923
Handle it with care. You
don't know what love is.

811
01:19:59,195 --> 01:20:01,595
You don't know what's
the scent of love?

812
01:20:01,931 --> 01:20:04,331
You don't know the language
between two eyes.

813
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:06,999
When the girl who loves
with you, is beside you..

814
01:20:07,069 --> 01:20:10,004
You can conquer this world
single-handedly.

815
01:20:11,107 --> 01:20:13,166
But you might not know about it.

816
01:20:15,111 --> 01:20:18,103
What do you know about me?
- What?

817
01:20:18,948 --> 01:20:21,075
Don't tell me, that you
too have loved someone.

818
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:23,618
Where? In the desert of Manpur..

819
01:20:23,686 --> 01:20:26,746
..or in the moonlight.
- Shut up.

820
01:20:28,291 --> 01:20:33,627
Wow! So you can speak
in English also?

821
01:20:35,698 --> 01:20:40,635
The world that we thought about.. ..

822
01:20:40,703 --> 01:20:43,638
..was a beautiful dream

823
01:20:45,308 --> 01:20:47,173
Or this is a dangerous truth?

824
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:54,081
O Ragini, where are you?

825
01:21:07,096 --> 01:21:09,223
Excuse me.
- Yes.

826
01:21:09,999 --> 01:21:11,762
I want to meet Dhananjay Pandit.

827
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:17,005
Hold on.
- Jadeja speaking. Over.

828
01:21:17,073 --> 01:21:20,008
Yes, sir.
- Sandhya, listen to me carefully.

829
01:21:20,076 --> 01:21:21,600
Aftab and Dhananjay have
jumped on a goods train..

830
01:21:21,677 --> 01:21:24,111
..and they are heading
towards Agra.

831
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:27,013
We will try to catch then
at the next station, over.

832
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:29,779
But, how far has your
investigation reached.

833
01:21:29,852 --> 01:21:33,618
Sandhya, I feel that some senior
level officer is there..

834
01:21:33,689 --> 01:21:37,022
..behind the murder of Swarabji.

835
01:21:37,093 --> 01:21:40,119
Sir, it might be Mr. Vaikunth.
She is a fool. - Right.

836
01:21:40,196 --> 01:21:42,630
Any new information. What
about the job that..

837
01:21:42,698 --> 01:21:45,633
..you were about to do?
- The room that Dhananjay Pandit..

838
01:21:45,701 --> 01:21:48,636
..was talking about, the Economic
Times newspaper..

839
01:21:48,704 --> 01:21:51,639
..of 13th June 97, was found
there which was half burnt.

840
01:21:52,007 --> 01:21:54,567
Listen! Then same day Dhananjay
Pandit's photo..

841
01:21:54,643 --> 01:21:57,976
..was printed in a newspaper
along with Justice Swarabji.

842
01:21:58,047 --> 01:21:59,912
Whose voice is that?

843
01:21:59,982 --> 01:22:02,644
A girl came here searching
Dhananjay.

844
01:22:02,985 --> 01:22:06,580
According to this girl, it seems
that Dhananjay and Swarabji..

845
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:10,591
..knew each other.
- And this isn't routine.

846
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:12,991
What do you think?
- I too feel the same way.

847
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:17,862
Sandhya, don't let her
go till we reach there.

848
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:22,196
I feel that this girl might
help us to capture them.

849
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:25,240
For God sake don't do a
mistake this time, over.

850
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:29,069
Sir, by the way, what
was other's opinion?

851
01:22:29,145 --> 01:22:30,203
I will tell you about that later.

852
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:33,612
First of all, arrest that girl.. -

853
01:22:33,682 --> 01:22:36,947
..Listen!

854
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:50,227
Where have we reached?
- We are at the same place..

855
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:56,597
Just this train moving.
- A girl's photo with you!

856
01:22:57,306 --> 01:22:59,774
It means that you
too loved someone.

857
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:03,976
What happened? Didn't it work?

858
01:23:07,116 --> 01:23:10,847
Beautiful girl! You might
have broken her heart.

859
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:12,911
You might have fought with her.

860
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:15,181
What else can you do?

861
01:23:19,261 --> 01:23:20,660
Their parents broke
the relationship.

862
01:23:21,931 --> 01:23:25,765
What else could they have done?
It was bound to happen.

863
01:23:27,069 --> 01:23:29,833
May be because you don't
have money and job.

864
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:40,944
Because I didn't have a
father's name with me.

865
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:53,186
Aftab, are you listening to
me or not? - What is it?

866
01:23:53,262 --> 01:23:55,594
Tomorrow, you have to come
to my home with proposa!.

867
01:23:55,664 --> 01:23:57,894
My father got transferred.

868
01:23:57,967 --> 01:23:59,559
The day after tomorrow,
we are going to Kashmir..

869
01:23:59,635 --> 01:24:01,569
..and from there we
are going forever.

870
01:24:02,171 --> 01:24:03,570
Okay, I'll come.

871
01:24:22,258 --> 01:24:25,250
''O God!"

872
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:30,828
''In this wide world..''

873
01:24:31,934 --> 01:24:36,098
''..everyone is there."

874
01:24:37,006 --> 01:24:41,340
''Still my eyes search for you."

875
01:24:43,112 --> 01:24:49,176
''No news of yours has reached me.''

876
01:24:56,225 --> 01:25:03,063
''My love!"

877
01:25:06,569 --> 01:25:13,031
''My cruel beloved!''

878
01:25:16,912 --> 01:25:21,815
''My love!'' "My cruel beloved!"

879
01:25:22,651 --> 01:25:26,917
''Don't sever the delicate
strings of love.''

880
01:25:26,989 --> 01:25:28,286
''I don't wish..''

881
01:25:29,658 --> 01:25:34,322
''I don't wish to live without you.''

882
01:25:34,663 --> 01:25:38,827
''I don't wish to live without you.''

883
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:44,936
''I don't wish to live without you.''

884
01:25:45,674 --> 01:25:49,337
''I don't wish to live without you.''

885
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,904
''I am left with nothing."

886
01:26:19,975 --> 01:26:22,808
''You carried everything away.''

887
01:26:22,878 --> 01:26:27,906
''Leaving me behind with
only memories galore."

888
01:26:33,055 --> 01:26:35,751
''I am left with nothing."

889
01:26:35,824 --> 01:26:38,224
''You carried everything away.''

890
01:26:38,293 --> 01:26:42,286
''Leaving me behind with
only memories galore."

891
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:48,933
''These lips were full of wishes."

892
01:26:49,004 --> 01:26:52,872
''Now only complaints
remain on them."

893
01:26:53,108 --> 01:26:55,872
''Where are you lost?''

894
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:58,538
''You have turned unfaithful
to my love."

895
01:26:58,614 --> 01:27:03,608
''Don't lie in love."

896
01:27:03,686 --> 01:27:10,558
''I don't wish to live without you.''

897
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:15,190
''I don't wish to live without you.''

898
01:27:16,632 --> 01:27:21,092
''I don't wish to live without you.''

899
01:27:21,637 --> 01:27:25,266
''I don't wish to live without you.''

900
01:27:27,142 --> 01:27:31,078
''I don't wish to live without you.''

901
01:27:32,114 --> 01:27:35,982
''I don't wish to live without you.''

902
01:27:37,653 --> 01:27:41,953
''I don't wish to live without you.''

903
01:27:42,658 --> 01:27:46,321
''I don't wish to live without you.''

904
01:28:05,047 --> 01:28:07,277
Sir, the train is about to
be here in five minutes.

905
01:28:13,055 --> 01:28:16,547
Now I will see how
Jadeja troubles me.

906
01:28:16,959 --> 01:28:20,690
Sir. - Whatever it is, after
all he is CBI officer.

907
01:28:20,896 --> 01:28:22,557
You have seen it. Every time..

908
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:26,226
..he has troubled me. He is
helping them to escape.

909
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:29,297
He will be suspended when
report reaches there.

910
01:28:39,378 --> 01:28:41,505
Jai.

911
01:28:42,047 --> 01:28:45,278
It's me.
- Ragini, hi.

912
01:28:46,385 --> 01:28:51,118
Police is waiting for you at the
next station. You get down.

913
01:28:51,189 --> 01:28:54,522
I love you too, baby.
- Idiot.

914
01:28:54,593 --> 01:28:58,927
I'm saying that police is waiting
for you at the next station.

915
01:28:58,997 --> 01:29:01,227
They are waiting for you.
- What? ..

916
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:04,064
..Idiot, she is saying it in
English. Try to understand.

917
01:29:05,237 --> 01:29:06,329
I can't hear you.

918
01:29:07,506 --> 01:29:11,636
Jai, the driver has been killed.
Get off the train.

919
01:29:16,448 --> 01:29:20,384
Let's jump. - What are you doing?
Do you want to die?

920
01:30:35,460 --> 01:30:37,223
Aftab, do it, fast.

921
01:32:44,022 --> 01:32:47,082
Sir, the driver of that train is
dead. It has gone on the wrong track.

922
01:32:47,159 --> 01:32:49,457
And it will collapse, because
there is a closed passing.

923
01:33:35,307 --> 01:33:36,433
They are dead.

924
01:33:37,342 --> 01:33:40,334
Not that easily, sir. Look there.

925
01:33:43,381 --> 01:33:47,579
Bhakta, inform all the check
posts about their vehicle.

926
01:33:49,354 --> 01:33:51,845
Announce a curfew. Inform
me about the surrounding..

927
01:33:51,923 --> 01:33:55,017
..railway stations
and airports. -Sir.

928
01:34:13,945 --> 01:34:15,105
Hold on.

929
01:34:31,896 --> 01:34:34,228
That means that we are with each
other without any reason. ..

930
01:34:34,299 --> 01:34:36,096
.. -No. Not without a reason.

931
01:34:36,167 --> 01:34:38,226
There must have been some
reason behind it.

932
01:34:47,345 --> 01:34:49,245
Jai, where are you going?

933
01:34:49,314 --> 01:34:51,578
I am going to make a
call to my lawyer.

934
01:34:52,517 --> 01:34:55,315
I think he is the one who can
save me from this trouble.

935
01:35:04,362 --> 01:35:06,853
Chenoy here.
- Hello, Mr. Lawyer.

936
01:35:06,931 --> 01:35:09,365
I am Dhananjay speaking.
- Dhananjay, where are you?

937
01:35:09,434 --> 01:35:11,334
Are you alright? Are you fine?

938
01:35:11,403 --> 01:35:12,870
I am unable to
understand anything..

939
01:35:12,937 --> 01:35:15,030
I am in neck-deep trouble.

940
01:35:15,106 --> 01:35:17,472
I know that your brother is
the reason for all these.

941
01:35:18,209 --> 01:35:20,473
God knows, what else he is up to!

942
01:35:20,545 --> 01:35:22,103
Now I have separated from here.

943
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:24,341
He will go his way and
I will go on my way.

944
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:29,012
Don't be foolish. That
man must be with you.

945
01:35:29,087 --> 01:35:33,046
If he won't be with you, I
can't prove you innocent.

946
01:35:34,426 --> 01:35:38,226
Tell me where you are right now.
- I don't know.

947
01:35:38,296 --> 01:35:41,322
Nearby Dhaulpur.
- Alright. You do one thing.

948
01:35:41,399 --> 01:35:44,334
Tomorrow morning, get a plane
from Agra to Bombay.

949
01:35:44,402 --> 01:35:47,428
I will arrange the tickets.
- But why with Aftab?

950
01:35:48,006 --> 01:35:51,339
Listen to me Dhananjay.
Try to understand me.

951
01:35:51,409 --> 01:35:53,969
You are accused of terrorism..

952
01:35:54,045 --> 01:35:56,570
And you may be executed for this.

953
01:35:58,350 --> 01:35:59,840
And even if you escape
the execution..

954
01:35:59,918 --> 01:36:02,352
You will die in the
jail for 35 years.

955
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:06,015
I need that person at
any cost to save you.

956
01:36:06,858 --> 01:36:09,383
And if he is innocent, he
will get out himself..

957
01:36:09,461 --> 01:36:12,362
But that doesn't alter your case.

958
01:36:12,430 --> 01:36:15,866
Dhananjay, if you want
to save your life..

959
01:36:15,934 --> 01:36:19,995
..listen to me at least
for this time. - Ok.

960
01:36:31,316 --> 01:36:34,547
What's the matter, Jai?
- Nothing.

961
01:36:38,890 --> 01:36:40,858
Where are you going?
- It's about to be night.

962
01:36:40,925 --> 01:36:42,552
I will reach my home in darkness.
- Are you mad?

963
01:36:42,894 --> 01:36:45,226
Police might be waiting for you.

964
01:36:46,231 --> 01:36:47,823
I don't know anything. ..

965
01:36:47,899 --> 01:36:50,561
I have to go to my mother.
- And after that?

966
01:36:53,338 --> 01:36:55,397
I will go somewhere
with my mother.

967
01:36:55,473 --> 01:36:58,442
Aftab, listen to me at
least for one time.

968
01:36:59,344 --> 01:37:02,313
You don't know how big this case is.

969
01:37:02,380 --> 01:37:04,348
I just talked to my lawyer.

970
01:37:04,416 --> 01:37:08,580
They will arrest both you and
your mother as terrorists.

971
01:37:09,354 --> 01:37:11,845
At least think about your mother.

972
01:37:14,459 --> 01:37:15,585
I will save her.

973
01:37:17,262 --> 01:37:19,856
Listen to us, Aftab. Even
in the city like Bombay..

974
01:37:19,931 --> 01:37:22,229
..many innocent people
are dying in the jail.

975
01:37:22,867 --> 01:37:27,861
No one will even know what the
police will do with you.

976
01:37:28,406 --> 01:37:32,103
If not for you, at least
think about your mother.

977
01:37:33,478 --> 01:37:35,537
Do you want your mother
to be arrested?

978
01:37:47,492 --> 01:37:50,859
Aftab. I have arranged everything.

979
01:37:51,362 --> 01:37:53,557
We will take the plane
from Agra to Bombay.

980
01:37:54,299 --> 01:37:56,233
There, my lawyer Chenoy will
take care of everything.

981
01:38:02,373 --> 01:38:06,104
Let's go. - Hold on. When
should we reach Agra? ..

982
01:38:06,177 --> 01:38:07,371
Tomorrow morning. Come on.

983
01:38:07,445 --> 01:38:10,209
No. There is still one
story to be completed.

984
01:38:10,281 --> 01:38:12,442
The story of Aftab and Ruksana.
- What?

985
01:38:13,251 --> 01:38:18,211
Aftab told me everything.
She stays in this city.

986
01:38:19,023 --> 01:38:20,490
Let's meet her once.

987
01:38:24,028 --> 01:38:25,086
There is no use in it.

988
01:38:25,396 --> 01:38:28,092
It's very hard to
get the loved ones.

989
01:38:28,533 --> 01:38:30,398
Don't let her go so easily.

990
01:38:43,548 --> 01:38:47,006
O God! It seems that Ruksana
is getting married.

991
01:38:47,085 --> 01:38:48,484
What should we do now?

992
01:38:50,288 --> 01:38:53,917
I will bring Ruksana. You
stay here till then.

993
01:39:16,314 --> 01:39:17,372
Ruksana, let's go.

994
01:39:53,418 --> 01:39:54,544
Aftab, stop!

995
01:40:20,411 --> 01:40:24,313
O Great. Now what shall
we do? The road is over.

996
01:40:24,983 --> 01:40:26,314
We will miss the flight.

997
01:40:27,051 --> 01:40:28,916
We won't. ..

998
01:40:28,987 --> 01:40:32,013
..There must be some way.
Come with me.

999
01:40:32,090 --> 01:40:35,526
We have to do something about it.
- Come on.

1000
01:40:39,364 --> 01:40:43,892
What's the matter?
- I am very scared.

1001
01:40:46,270 --> 01:40:47,897
I ran away.

1002
01:40:50,908 --> 01:40:52,432
Will people accept
this relationship?

1003
01:40:59,550 --> 01:41:01,415
People treat God as God.

1004
01:41:03,488 --> 01:41:05,353
But I have treated you as God.

1005
01:41:06,557 --> 01:41:10,152
And I know that I have got my God.

1006
01:41:11,295 --> 01:41:12,626
Now it's up to the God.

1007
01:41:20,405 --> 01:41:25,138
And if I know my God well, he
will accept this relationship.

1008
01:41:30,381 --> 01:41:31,439
Do you accept it?

1009
01:41:39,424 --> 01:41:40,482
Do you accept it?

1010
01:41:46,264 --> 01:41:47,322
Do you accept it?

1011
01:41:54,372 --> 01:41:55,430
I accept it.

1012
01:42:00,378 --> 01:42:04,041
Aftab, the problem is solved.

1013
01:42:04,115 --> 01:42:08,108
We got a caravan that can
take us to Agra by morning.

1014
01:42:31,442 --> 01:42:35,879
''No matter how much
the world stops."

1015
01:42:36,180 --> 01:42:40,310
''This love is bound to happen.''

1016
01:42:44,522 --> 01:42:49,459
''No matter how much
the world stops."

1017
01:42:50,361 --> 01:42:54,263
''This love is bound to happen.''

1018
01:42:54,866 --> 01:42:56,959
''The eyes meet."

1019
01:42:57,201 --> 01:42:59,396
''The sleep is lost."

1020
01:42:59,470 --> 01:43:01,438
''A fire erupts."

1021
01:43:01,506 --> 01:43:08,139
''And one becomes helpless
and exchanges hearts!"

1022
01:43:08,212 --> 01:43:12,945
''One becomes helpless
and exchanges hearts!"

1023
01:43:40,878 --> 01:43:44,439
''You are in front of me, still
there are distances."

1024
01:43:45,016 --> 01:43:49,316
''This compulsion of
lovers is killing!"

1025
01:43:54,525 --> 01:43:58,427
''You are in front of me, still
there are distances."

1026
01:43:59,263 --> 01:44:03,256
''This compulsion of
lovers is killing!"

1027
01:44:04,202 --> 01:44:06,363
''I miss you, my sweetheart!''

1028
01:44:06,437 --> 01:44:08,871
''And I feel as if I
am losing my life!"

1029
01:44:08,940 --> 01:44:11,204
''I miss you, my sweetheart!''

1030
01:44:11,275 --> 01:44:13,402
''And I feel as if I
am losing my life!"

1031
01:44:14,212 --> 01:44:18,080
''When the bangles tinkle
during the night.''

1032
01:44:18,149 --> 01:44:22,552
''One has to exchanges hearts!"

1033
01:44:23,221 --> 01:44:27,555
''One has to exchanges hearts!"

1034
01:44:46,210 --> 01:44:49,839
''We travel in love on
love to reach love."

1035
01:44:50,381 --> 01:44:54,477
''It is paradoxical like drowning
and crossing the stream."

1036
01:45:00,258 --> 01:45:03,386
''We travel in love on
love to reach love."

1037
01:45:04,362 --> 01:45:08,389
''lt is paradoxical like drowning
and crossing the stream."

1038
01:45:09,033 --> 01:45:12,867
''This condition is strange."

1039
01:45:13,404 --> 01:45:18,068
''This condition is strange."

1040
01:45:19,377 --> 01:45:23,370
''Each moment appears an eternity!''

1041
01:45:23,447 --> 01:45:27,884
''One has to exchanges hearts!"

1042
01:45:27,952 --> 01:45:32,446
''One has to exchanges hearts!"

1043
01:45:32,890 --> 01:45:37,156
''No matter how much
the world stops."

1044
01:45:37,461 --> 01:45:41,898
''This love is bound to happen.''

1045
01:45:41,966 --> 01:45:46,960
''The eyes meet. The sleep is lost.''

1046
01:45:47,305 --> 01:45:49,205

01:46:00,518 --> 01:46:05,319
''One has to exchanges hearts!"

1050
01:46:34,318 --> 01:46:37,048
Thanks.
- Come on, let's move.

1051
01:46:41,225 --> 01:46:44,991
Jai, this airport
is empty. Now what?

1052
01:46:47,331 --> 01:46:50,061
My lawyer would have left
the tickets some counter.

1053
01:46:50,134 --> 01:46:52,864
Aftab, you look there.
I will see here.

1054
01:46:58,309 --> 01:46:59,367
Come, Ruksana.

1055
01:47:07,251 --> 01:47:08,843
C'mon look everywhere they
might be here. - No.

1056
01:47:08,919 --> 01:47:11,080
Let's see.
- Good morning, sir.

1057
01:47:11,155 --> 01:47:13,419
I want to talk to you
about Dhananjay Pandit.

1058
01:47:14,191 --> 01:47:16,489
Who are you? - My name is
Chenoy and I am his lawyer.

1059
01:47:23,267 --> 01:47:24,427
EnoughI

1060
01:47:27,505 --> 01:47:29,405
Your game is over.

1061
01:47:32,410 --> 01:47:35,379
Stop, Vaikunth. Use your brain.

1062
01:47:39,316 --> 01:47:41,045
Bring your pistols down.
- Arrest him.

1063
01:47:57,301 --> 01:47:58,359
Let's move.

1064
01:48:19,457 --> 01:48:21,448
You go, I will stop them.
- But you..

1065
01:48:24,361 --> 01:48:26,989
Aftab.
- Go. - Come on, move.

1066
01:49:00,297 --> 01:49:01,355
You keep going.

1067
01:49:31,462 --> 01:49:33,089
I will not leave you, scoundrels.

1068
01:49:35,366 --> 01:49:38,096
Ragini, the must be some
hospital around here.

1069
01:49:38,169 --> 01:49:41,366
Drive fast. - No, Dhananjay.
- You are bleeding badly.

1070
01:49:41,438 --> 01:49:43,338
If we go to doctor,
the police will know.

1071
01:49:43,407 --> 01:49:46,342
No, Aftab. We have to go to
the doctor. Ragini, faster.

1072
01:49:47,044 --> 01:49:48,443
Try to understand me.

1073
01:49:50,915 --> 01:49:53,383
We have to inform the Police,
before operating him.

1074
01:49:53,450 --> 01:49:56,476
Doctor, try to understand.
The bullet is in his chest.

1075
01:49:56,921 --> 01:49:58,286
That's none of our business.

1076
01:50:00,291 --> 01:50:01,383
You make it your bloody business.

1077
01:50:01,458 --> 01:50:04,120
What are you doing?
- Doctor.

1078
01:50:04,929 --> 01:50:10,629
Doctor, please. I am really
very angry right now. - Ok.

1079
01:50:11,302 --> 01:50:14,135
Ok!
- I will do it.

1080
01:50:16,307 --> 01:50:17,569
Aftab.

1081
01:50:23,414 --> 01:50:24,904
What was the necessity
to do all these? ..

1082
01:50:24,982 --> 01:50:26,643
.. -How could I leave
you in this condition!

1083
01:50:27,251 --> 01:50:30,448
And you too didn't need
to return for my life..

1084
01:50:32,256 --> 01:50:33,382
To save my life.

1085
01:50:34,358 --> 01:50:37,191
How could I leave you
in that condition!

1086
01:50:39,230 --> 01:50:41,095
You get well soon.

1087
01:50:47,238 --> 01:50:51,174
Do one more thing for me?
Take me to Mosque.

1088
01:50:53,611 --> 01:50:56,011
Today, I'll fulfill mother's
one more wish.

1089
01:51:05,389 --> 01:51:08,881
''You are the gracious one..

1090
01:51:08,959 --> 01:51:15,262
.. who grants everyone's wishes!"

1091
01:51:17,401 --> 01:51:21,895
''While everyone desires..

1092
01:51:21,972 --> 01:51:26,432
''..you are beyond all of them."

1093
01:51:28,412 --> 01:51:34,840
''You provide solutions
to one and all."

1094
01:51:35,219 --> 01:51:41,351
''You are the one who creates
wonders for the whole world."

1095
01:51:50,367 --> 01:51:54,360
''The wonders of this
place are such!''

1096
01:51:54,438 --> 01:51:58,431
''The wonders of this
place are such!''

1097
01:51:59,009 --> 01:52:03,207
''That all seekers coming
to its doors."

1098
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:07,376
''The wonders of this
place are such!''

1099
01:52:07,451 --> 01:52:11,888
''That all seekers coming
to its doors."

1100
01:52:12,423 --> 01:52:16,359
''Just because of your grace.''

1101
01:52:16,427 --> 01:52:20,386
''Just because of your grace.''

1102
01:52:20,464 --> 01:52:25,401
''All their wishes are fulfilled."

1103
01:52:25,469 --> 01:52:29,428
''Just because of your grace.''

1104
01:52:29,506 --> 01:52:34,170
''All their wishes are fulfilled."

1105
01:52:34,244 --> 01:52:38,340
''The wonders of this
place are such!''

1106
01:52:38,415 --> 01:52:42,374
''The wonders of this
place are such!''

1107
01:52:42,453 --> 01:52:46,856
''Never has been any heart
filled with sadness.."

1108
01:52:47,358 --> 01:52:50,850
''Never has been any heart
filled with sadness.."

1109
01:52:50,928 --> 01:52:55,865
''..returned empty handed
from your doors."

1110
01:52:55,933 --> 01:52:59,494
''..returned empty handed
from your doors."

1111
01:53:00,204 --> 01:53:04,265
''Your miracles are such!''

1112
01:53:04,341 --> 01:53:08,368
''Your miracles are such!''

1113
01:53:09,046 --> 01:53:12,914
''All the wishes are fulfilled!"

1114
01:53:12,983 --> 01:53:19,286
''Your wonders are great!''

1115
01:53:19,356 --> 01:53:22,382
''You make difficulties look simple!''

1116
01:53:22,459 --> 01:53:25,394
''You make difficulties look simple!''

1117
01:53:25,462 --> 01:53:28,226
''You revive all hopes."

1118
01:53:28,298 --> 01:53:30,823
''You revive all hopes."

1119
01:53:30,901 --> 01:53:37,329
''You unite the dear ones."

1120
01:53:37,408 --> 01:53:43,438
''Your wonders are great!''

1121
01:54:00,564 --> 01:54:05,194
''Seekers flock at your doors
all day and night.''

1122
01:54:05,269 --> 01:54:09,501
''Seekers flock at your doors
all day and night.''

1123
01:54:10,274 --> 01:54:11,366
Aftab?

1124
01:54:14,278 --> 01:54:19,910
I want to live because I want
to prove him not-guilty.

1125
01:54:21,285 --> 01:54:22,877
Mother always says..

1126
01:54:22,953 --> 01:54:28,289
..that the Lord will always keep
me under his protective eye.

1127
01:54:30,227 --> 01:54:34,823
I want to turn and see
whether I am alone..

1128
01:54:35,265 --> 01:54:40,862
No son, you are not alone. All the
relations are equal in his eyes.

1129
01:54:42,339 --> 01:54:45,570
And the biggest victory
lies within you..

1130
01:54:46,510 --> 01:54:51,379
Because after bearing so much
you have forgiven all.

1131
01:54:52,015 --> 01:54:55,849
''They receive the alms
of your inspiration.''

1132
01:54:55,919 --> 01:54:59,480
''They receive the alms
of your inspiration.''

their hands over here.''

''They receive the alms
of your inspiration.''

1135

''All those who spread
their hands over here.''

1136
01:55:12,436 --> 01:55:16,395
''They receive the alms
of your inspiration.''

1137

''Even the severed ties are
mended by your blessings.''

1142
01:55:54,244 --> 01:55:58,340
''Even the severed ties are
mended by your blessings.''

1143
01:55:58,415 --> 01:56:02,374
''People get pulled tied
with delicate strings."

1144
01:56:02,452 --> 01:56:06,946
''People get pulled tied
with delicate strings."

1145
01:56:07,024 --> 01:56:11,290
''You make the
separated ones meet."

1146
01:56:11,361 --> 01:56:15,457
''You make the
separated ones meet."

1147
01:56:15,532 --> 01:56:19,400
''And they lead a proud life
because of your grace.''

1148
01:56:19,469 --> 01:56:22,870
''The greatness of this place
is beyond expression!"

''No seeker has ever gone
empty handed from here.''

1151
01:56:31,281 --> 01:56:35,308
''No seeker has ever gone
empty handed from here.''

1152
01:56:35,385 --> 01:56:39,151
''The wishful ones come here.''

1153
01:56:39,222 --> 01:56:43,215
''The wishful ones come here.''

1154
01:56:43,293 --> 01:56:46,854
''Always get their wishes fulfilled."

1155
01:56:46,930 --> 01:56:51,230
''The wishful ones come here.''

1156
01:56:51,301 --> 01:56:56,238
''Always get their wishes fulfilled."

1157
01:56:56,306 --> 01:56:59,332
''The greatness of this place
is beyond expression!"

''Your wonders are great!''

1159
01:57:11,254 --> 01:57:13,848
''Your wonders are great!''

1160
01:57:36,213 --> 01:57:38,477
We are searching for two convicts.

1161
01:57:39,316 --> 01:57:40,874
There is no one here.

1162
01:57:46,223 --> 01:57:48,851
I told you that there is no one.

1163
01:57:50,827 --> 01:57:53,091
Sir, we shall go from here.

1164
01:58:25,262 --> 01:58:26,320
Come, Ragini.

1165
01:58:29,533 --> 01:58:31,865
Chenoy, what are you doing here?

1166
01:58:31,935 --> 01:58:33,368
Don't worry. Relax!

1167
01:58:33,437 --> 01:58:37,339
Hold on! Its ok, Aftab. He
is my lawyer. It's alright.

1168
01:58:38,208 --> 01:58:40,904
What are you doing here?
- I told him everything.

1169
01:58:41,945 --> 01:58:43,037
What are you talking about?

1170
01:58:43,113 --> 01:58:46,879
I told him everything that
we talked on the phone.

1171
01:58:46,950 --> 01:58:49,282
What did I tell you on the phone?
Have you gone mad?

1172
01:58:49,352 --> 01:58:52,412
How did you come here?
- Hold on. Relax.

1173
01:58:52,489 --> 01:58:57,392
Sir, according to our promise my
client has got this terrorist..

1174
01:58:59,396 --> 01:59:01,455
Chenoy, listen to me. Damned!

1175
01:59:01,531 --> 01:59:04,398
You keep quiet. Let
me hear what he says.

1176
01:59:04,468 --> 01:59:07,096
Sir, don't listen to him.
Chenoy, shut up.

1177
01:59:07,170 --> 01:59:08,432
Don't act like a child.

1178
01:59:10,373 --> 01:59:12,500
Aftab, this is a big
misunderstanding.

1179
01:59:12,576 --> 01:59:14,441
There is no misunderstanding

1180
01:59:20,383 --> 01:59:24,046
Everything is clear. Don't
try to escape this time.

1181
01:59:27,057 --> 01:59:29,491
What are you saying, Vaikunth?
This is my case.

1182
01:59:29,559 --> 01:59:32,084
It was your case. Now, it's my case.

1183
01:59:32,162 --> 01:59:34,426
Now, you got suspended.
- What are you saying?

1184
01:59:34,498 --> 01:59:36,864
Bhakta, show him the paper.

1185
01:59:40,337 --> 01:59:43,329
Now come with me. Now
you game is over.

1186
01:59:55,385 --> 01:59:58,445
Get him into the car.
- Aftab, believe me.

1187
01:59:58,522 --> 02:00:01,218
Leave me. I need to talk to him.

1188
02:00:07,230 --> 02:00:09,061
Catch him.

1189
02:00:13,236 --> 02:00:15,898
Aftab. Stop.

1190
02:00:20,310 --> 02:00:22,073
Catch him.

1191
02:00:37,460 --> 02:00:40,861
Mother, pack your luggage soon.

1192
02:00:40,931 --> 02:00:42,364
We have to leave this
place right now.

1193
02:00:42,966 --> 02:00:47,596
Where is Dhananjay?
- Forget him. He got arrested.

1194
02:00:48,271 --> 02:00:51,434
But son, he got into trouble
because of us.

1195
02:00:52,275 --> 02:00:54,266
You must help him out.
- Mother!

1196
02:00:54,344 --> 02:00:55,902
I don't want to hear anything.

1197
02:00:58,348 --> 02:01:01,875
I agree that Aftab is innocent.
And I am solely responsible..

1198
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:05,945
..for all the above
mentioned crimes.

1199
02:01:11,228 --> 02:01:12,957
It won't be of any help.

1200
02:01:13,029 --> 02:01:15,463
Your sacrifice won't be of any help.

1201
02:01:18,368 --> 02:01:20,563
You can't save Aftab in this way.

1202
02:01:21,238 --> 02:01:24,935
I won't leave that scoundrel.
- You won't harm him.

1203
02:01:25,008 --> 02:01:27,476
How dare you to behave
like that with me!

1204
02:01:28,245 --> 02:01:32,113
Bhakta, keep him inside
and keep and eye on him.

1205
02:01:32,449 --> 02:01:35,179
I will take care of Aftab.

1206
02:01:38,355 --> 02:01:41,415
Aftab, where are you going?

1207
02:01:46,263 --> 02:01:47,594
To get that fool out of there.

1208
02:01:54,371 --> 02:01:59,365
Bhakta, find that scoundrel out.

1209
02:02:00,277 --> 02:02:03,610
I want to drag him in this village.

1210
02:02:06,549 --> 02:02:08,210
Move fast.

1211
02:03:46,249 --> 02:03:49,844
I have beaten you hard.
Won't you arrest me?

1212
02:04:00,196 --> 02:04:01,356
Tie him down.

1213
02:04:09,372 --> 02:04:10,532
You scoundrel!

1214
02:04:14,277 --> 02:04:18,008
You have made my job easier
by surrendering yourself.

1215
02:04:18,415 --> 02:04:22,408
I will give you the pig's death.

1216
02:04:24,554 --> 02:04:26,613
Keep an eye on both of them.

1217
02:04:29,392 --> 02:04:31,223
You were asked to leave this place.

1218
02:04:31,294 --> 02:04:33,888
Why didn't you go till now?
Leave this place.

1219
02:04:34,230 --> 02:04:36,289
Leave this place right now.

1220
02:04:38,234 --> 02:04:40,168
Why did you surrender yourself?

1221
02:04:41,237 --> 02:04:44,206
You fool. You do know
what will happen now?

1222
02:04:44,474 --> 02:04:45,566
What did you come here?

1223
02:04:48,311 --> 02:04:50,836
I was missing you a lot.
That's why I came here.

1224
02:04:50,914 --> 02:04:52,245
It's not the time to
crack jokes, Aftab.

1225
02:04:52,315 --> 02:04:55,580
You have a chance to escape.
Then why did you come here?

1226
02:04:57,187 --> 02:04:59,849
I don't think that I need to
answer your every question.

1227
02:05:01,257 --> 02:05:06,422
And.. I don't think I have
an answer to this question.

1228
02:05:07,197 --> 02:05:08,858
Aftab, I have already
given the statement..

1229
02:05:08,932 --> 02:05:12,095
..that I am responsible for all
this and that you are innocent.

1230
02:05:12,168 --> 02:05:14,898
Are you mad? Why
have you done this?

1231
02:05:16,873 --> 02:05:19,535
I don't think that I need to
answer your every question.

1232
02:05:21,211 --> 02:05:26,114
And I don't think I have an
answer to this question.

1233
02:05:31,488 --> 02:05:35,322
Hello rabbit. Answer me,
where are you?

1234
02:05:35,391 --> 02:05:36,517
I am Rula speaking.

1235
02:05:39,329 --> 02:05:40,990
Sir.
- What?

1236
02:05:41,064 --> 02:05:44,966
Sir, this low frequency.
Only terrorists use this.

1237
02:05:45,034 --> 02:05:46,968
What do you think, sir?
- How far is that?

1238
02:05:48,238 --> 02:05:50,069
Sir, 50-100 meters.

1239
02:06:37,220 --> 02:06:39,279
I am sending the goods.
Don't worry about it.

1240
02:06:39,355 --> 02:06:40,413
Freeze!

1241
02:06:41,991 --> 02:06:46,052
Wow, Bhakta. You are praiseworthy.

1242
02:06:46,496 --> 02:06:47,827
All these days you were under me..

1243
02:06:47,897 --> 02:06:50,957
And you fooled a person like me?

1244
02:06:51,367 --> 02:06:54,234
The explosives that we got
the orders to destroy..

1245
02:06:54,304 --> 02:06:56,568
And you are selling
those to the enemy.

1246
02:06:56,873 --> 02:07:01,867
Wow! I am really proud of you.

1247
02:07:34,210 --> 02:07:35,268
Jadeja!

1248
02:07:44,220 --> 02:07:46,051
What is going on, Bhakta?

1249
02:07:48,324 --> 02:07:52,954
Sir, I came here chasing you.

1250
02:07:53,363 --> 02:07:55,991
And I saw that Commander
has made you faint.

1251
02:07:56,466 --> 02:07:59,560
And he was trying to kill you.
I tried to stop him.

1252
02:08:00,169 --> 02:08:02,034
Then he tried to kill me too.

1253
02:08:03,506 --> 02:08:05,406
You got into senses
at the right time..

1254
02:08:06,342 --> 02:08:08,310
Or else both of us would
have got killed.

1255
02:08:08,378 --> 02:08:12,178
But why did you kill him? -There
was no other option, sir.

1256
02:08:14,183 --> 02:08:15,946
I have heard everything
on the radio.

1257
02:08:17,453 --> 02:08:19,182
We were searching for this person.

1258
02:08:20,923 --> 02:08:23,949
That means that my opinion
about Vaikunth was right.

1259
02:08:24,327 --> 02:08:27,353
Hello, answer me rabbit.

1260
02:08:28,331 --> 02:08:31,858
Bhakta, answer in Vaikunth's voice.

1261
02:08:33,269 --> 02:08:36,261
Yes, I am rabbit speaking.
- What happened to your voice?

1262
02:08:36,339 --> 02:08:37,897
Nothing. Tell me what's the matter?

1263
02:08:37,974 --> 02:08:40,169
When are our goods reaching here?
- Yes.

1264
02:08:40,243 --> 02:08:43,269
This time I need two trucks.
One, of the last time's..

1265
02:08:43,346 --> 02:08:46,281
And another of this time.
- Ok.

1266
02:08:46,549 --> 02:08:48,915
Kuldhara village, at 6 pm.

1267
02:08:48,985 --> 02:08:54,617
And I hope that you trapped
those kids. Good bye.

1268
02:08:57,560 --> 02:09:02,429
What will we do now, sir?
- Now!

1269
02:09:05,368 --> 02:09:07,461
This is the right time
to catch those buyers.

1270
02:09:08,371 --> 02:09:11,306
You fill two trucks with stones
in place of explosives

1271
02:09:11,441 --> 02:09:14,035
And take 20 bright
officers with you.

1272
02:09:14,310 --> 02:09:18,041
You arrange the trucks and I
will arrange the officers.

1273
02:09:18,114 --> 02:09:19,172
Right.

1274
02:09:28,391 --> 02:09:29,483
Ranjit.
- Sir.

1275
02:09:34,364 --> 02:09:38,391
Come to Kuldhara village with
two trucks from another way.

1276
02:09:39,902 --> 02:09:43,099
Vaikunth got killed, but what
will happen to us, sir?

1277
02:09:44,374 --> 02:09:46,433
You have to stay
here for some time.

1278
02:09:47,276 --> 02:09:50,074
I will complete the procedure after
returning from the border.

1279
02:09:50,413 --> 02:09:54,873
But why not now? - Because..
Bhakta, is everything ready?

1280
02:09:54,951 --> 02:09:56,282
Yes.
- Good.

1281
02:09:57,353 --> 02:10:01,619
Two will be here and the rest
of them will come with us.

1282
02:10:02,225 --> 02:10:04,625
Sir, when you got the culprit,
then why don't you let us go?

1283
02:10:04,961 --> 02:10:07,896
But I have to change your
statement after returning.

1284
02:10:08,231 --> 02:10:11,098
Behram, you sit at the radio.
Let's go, Bhakta.

1285
02:10:39,362 --> 02:10:45,358
O my god! O Jesus! I got it.
- What?

1286
02:10:45,435 --> 02:10:48,996
Bhakta. He was the one on the
swing. He gave me the bomb.

1287
02:10:50,273 --> 02:10:52,036
Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

1288
02:10:52,408 --> 02:10:56,344
That means he is the
cause of all these.

1289
02:10:56,412 --> 02:10:58,277
He will finish Jadeja at the border.

1290
02:10:58,347 --> 02:11:00,440
And he will finish
us after returning.

1291
02:11:01,918 --> 02:11:02,942
What should we do now?

1292
02:11:04,554 --> 02:11:08,581
There is only one thing to do.
Let's go and blow their band.

1293
02:11:16,399 --> 02:11:19,891
Sir, if you wish, I will ask
the soldiers to surround..

1294
02:11:19,969 --> 02:11:21,368
..Kuldhara village.

1295
02:11:21,437 --> 02:11:25,032
You know this village
better than me.

1296
02:11:25,107 --> 02:11:26,438
Whatever you want to do, do it fast.

1297
02:11:26,509 --> 02:11:30,343
But the terrorists shouldn't
escape this time.

1298
02:11:30,880 --> 02:11:33,849
Sir. - Cover the last village
of the border, Kuldhara..

1299
02:11:33,916 --> 02:11:39,252
..from behind. And don't proceed
till I order. - Ok, sir.

1300
02:13:01,938 --> 02:13:05,169
Bhakta will destroy
the whole country.

1301
02:13:06,208 --> 02:13:08,438
I am here. Don't get scared.

1302
02:13:15,551 --> 02:13:19,282
Sir, this is Kuldhara, the
last village of the border.

1303
02:13:22,925 --> 02:13:25,120
And look there, the truck is there.

1304
02:13:31,467 --> 02:13:33,560
Let's go.
- Sir.

1305
02:13:35,371 --> 02:13:40,172
I know this village very well.
I will go forward with two men.

1306
02:13:40,242 --> 02:13:42,472
And you cover me with two men.

1307
02:13:44,347 --> 02:13:47,407
Where has Bhakta gone?

1308
02:13:49,518 --> 02:13:51,986
Scoundrel!

1309
02:14:16,278 --> 02:14:19,441
Aftab, they are more than 25.

1310
02:14:19,515 --> 02:14:22,211
Come, let's teach them counting.

1311
02:14:23,285 --> 02:14:24,343
Lura.

1312
02:14:26,555 --> 02:14:29,456
Will you kill Lura? Are you mad?

1313
02:14:29,525 --> 02:14:31,891
I am just pretending. The
CBI officer is behind me.

1314
02:14:31,961 --> 02:14:33,986
Send your men and bring him here.

1315
02:14:45,341 --> 02:14:48,572
Contact Lieutenant to
attack the village.

1316
02:14:50,346 --> 02:14:51,404
Throw your weapons.

1317
02:15:02,925 --> 02:15:06,122
You didn't get me till now.

1318
02:15:06,896 --> 02:15:09,865
I am the one killed the
constable Jetamil..

1319
02:15:09,932 --> 02:15:13,868
..and the train driver and I
have also killed Vaikunth.

1320
02:15:14,537 --> 02:15:17,870
And I am the one who
trapped those kids.

1321
02:15:19,041 --> 02:15:23,239
Now I will kill you here and
kill those kids there.

1322
02:15:23,412 --> 02:15:27,348
And then I will become the
commandant. Kill him.

1323
02:17:38,848 --> 02:17:41,544
Can't you say? - Can't you go? Move.

1324
02:19:22,518 --> 02:19:25,214
How many times will you escape?
- You are there to save me.

1325
02:20:28,384 --> 02:20:29,908
Aftab!

1326
02:21:08,357 --> 02:21:09,415
Aftab!

1327
02:21:16,298 --> 02:21:17,458
Attacked them.

1328
02:21:39,521 --> 02:21:45,187
The same way the soul leaves one
body and goes into a new body.

1329
02:21:45,260 --> 02:21:46,852
It is said that after
the death of father..

1330
02:21:46,929 --> 02:21:50,592
..the elder son has to take up the
responsibility of fulfilling his..

1331
02:21:50,899 --> 02:21:56,997
.. incomplete culture his
incomplete work, his desires.

1332
02:21:57,206 --> 02:21:59,868
You have to take up
the responsibility..

1333
02:21:59,942 --> 02:22:02,877
..of the family and all
the relatives of father..

1334
02:22:02,945 --> 02:22:06,403
..with all your heart
and fulfill his promise.

1335
02:22:09,885 --> 02:22:10,943
Take this, Aftab..

1336
02:22:17,459 --> 02:22:18,892
This is your right.

1337
02:22:33,876 --> 02:22:36,242
Aftab, you would've got all the
answers for your question..

1338
02:22:37,513 --> 02:22:40,209
..but somebody is still
waiting for your answer.

1339
02:22:52,861 --> 02:22:57,264
Mother, you want the
answer.. then listen.

1340
02:22:59,368 --> 02:23:01,233
Your decision was sacred..

1341
02:23:03,906 --> 02:23:10,903
You only loved. The
time betrayed us.

1342
02:23:15,551 --> 02:23:20,887
I pray to god that every woman..

1343
02:23:23,392 --> 02:23:25,053
..gets strength like you.

1344
02:23:26,094 --> 02:23:30,554
Every son should be lucky like me.

1345
02:23:35,504 --> 02:23:36,835
But I didn't get one like you.

1346
02:23:41,009 --> 02:23:43,239
Mother, please forgive me.

1347
02:23:46,515 --> 02:23:50,417
I took more time to mature.

1348
02:23:53,989 --> 02:23:58,221
Mother always tell me,
why I am so lonely.

1349
02:24:01,196 --> 02:24:05,599
Why don't I cry and don't take
any support from anybody?

1350
02:24:08,203 --> 02:24:09,602
Today I will ask.

1351
02:24:11,273 --> 02:24:15,869
Now I don't want to
