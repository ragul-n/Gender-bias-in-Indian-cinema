00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,136
In this situation sameer sahib kept us...

11
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:13,110
If you'd be in your order so
you'd had to go with him to delhi...

12
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,139
Yes I'd go with him...

00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,980

15
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,273

26
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,150

27
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:13,393
He'll keep fixing the strings...
but he'll not fix the T.V.

28
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,424
You are able to hear it...

29
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,435
The T. V Is to see...

30
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,902

May be there is no value
of music among muslims...

79
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,288

80
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,327

154
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,961
Do you know who did it?

155
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:37,800
I was at my aunt's house.

156
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:48,874
Its good that you were not here...

157
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,175

I brought it by out of
the sigth of mother...

160
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,235
You knew that the kitchen

200

going to make a water...

220
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,036
What Is the gain by living like death...

221
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,419
You can think it...

222

00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:35,596

I backed the bread whole
my life in bakery... what I did wrong.

240
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:36,023
Where is the window...

241
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:05,418

242
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:08,824

Did'nt you noted his number?

245
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:28,306
No...
I did more smartess work than it.

246
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:34,716
I gave them 800 rupees...

247
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:05,838
Just think this by this way...

248
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:08,741
Annu was along...
so you had to give money...

249
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:11,882
Its the system here's.

250
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:14,954
Did'nt I paid 10000 for the CD.

251
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:17,016
Which is of mine...

252
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:18,520
and weather only for 5 minutes...

253
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,591
Annu was along...
so I did'nt paid money...

254
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:31,540
I gave money...
because I was afraid...

255
00:53:38,315 --> 00:53:39,282
Do you what Is being a victim...

256
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,686
Do you ever had change
your name for something...

257
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:48,346
before appreciating any pakistani player...

258
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:31,800
What had happend when the foundation
man was asking about you?

259
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:34,302
So you have had to tell
your name sameer shiekh...

260
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:39,503
I'm coward...

261
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:45,005
then I started to make myself understand...

262
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:50,438
currently you said you were scared...

263
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:54,739
What do you think after listening
this I'd like to we stay here anymore?

264
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:01,984
You are sameer arshad shiekh...

265
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:05,124
And this is no gonna change...

266
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:38,822
When did you came from your aunt's
place, today morning.

267
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:42,829
When did you went?
I don't remember,

268
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:45,261
I told you I don't know,

269
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:52,097
Shut up, wear it rather you will be
cold,

270
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:56,507
Once I'll get those bastards,
I won't spare them,

271
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:04,676
Muneera, correct your mode,

272
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:08,486
Your mode is good,
that's enough.

273
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,291
They know me,
Come on,

274
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:31,441
What was that after "dum tana tana"
I just lost somewhere,

275
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:36,141
I was also lost,

276
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:45,725
Suddenly it reminds me about that day,
when I went first time on Wali's tomb,

277
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:54,667
October 1960,

278
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:02,767
It was full moon night and the amazing
thing that was rainy day,

279
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:08,279
then Pandit Jee and Me sung Raag
Malaar,

280
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:12,678
then he forced me that he will drop
me home,

281
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:14,483
then we moved on,

282
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:22,230
Now suddenly he stopped his bike
at wali's tomb,

283
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:25,767
and start singing wali,

284
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:45,546
On that tomb with washed with rain,
and with moon light,

285
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,786
suddenly I felt some movement,

286
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:53,823
do you know what was that,

287
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:57,563
it was mouse,

288
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:06,267
We all three lost in that darkness of
night and wali's poetry.

289
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:10,571
Nobody moves,
Nor me,

290
00:59:11,814 --> 00:59:16,808
nor Pandit Jee neither that mouse,

291
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:39,270
Wali was belongs to dakkan,

292
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,940
but he really loved gujrat,

293
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:46,137
that he lived here,

294
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:56,322
Whenever I passed through from his
tomb, I must stopped for pray,

295
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:05,865
When I read in paper that his
tomb has broke,

296
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:10,805
then I know who was "Wali Gujrati".

297
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:21,407
I knew that,

298
01:00:26,255 --> 01:00:29,588
I knew that,
he was on right place,

299
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:49,673
What you were doing at mid-night,

300
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:01,781
How it shuts?
We have to go hospital,

301
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:04,918
Wound is not deep but we have to
stitch them,

302
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:10,390
Come on, don't waste the time,
You stay, we both are going,

303
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:28,939
If you will ask me again and again
then will I say that I saw him,

304
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:34,948
Haneef said that you know everything,

305
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:40,683
We both know,

306
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:52,666
Why you always start it,
You started that,

307
01:02:57,707 --> 01:03:00,232
I think mehel's sister did it,

308
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,236
Who knows?

309
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:05,872
People can do anything on this time,

310
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:34,868
Altaf will meet you at suleman's shop,

311
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:37,431
I can't leave her alone,

312
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:39,673
Who is there?

313
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:43,877
He is goga,
what are you doing here, go home,

314
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:49,509
What?
What's he saying,

315
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:53,348
He is saying that he really likes
pretty zinta,

316
01:04:53,923 --> 01:04:56,323
Mamu has been killed,

317
01:04:56,492 --> 01:04:57,686
He is mamu's son,

318
01:04:58,027 --> 01:05:01,360
Let him stay with us,
how would he go alone,

319
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:03,758
then you sit down.
You come with us,

320
01:05:06,802 --> 01:05:10,636
fine, if our neighbour will sit with
heera then I'll come,

321
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:12,969
It will be good for me to go outside,

322
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,268
Fine,
come soon,

323
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,347
He is like that,
yes since childhood,

324
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:22,079
once het got his head injured,
since he is like that,

325
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:24,319
does he know?
What?

326
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,882
His father is dead,
how do I know that he knew it or not,

327
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:36,790
Haneef! When did you started,
I started it because of tension,

328
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,958
Come!
After so long,

329
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:08,523
Lucky's night become more lucky.
Two large omlett,

330
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:10,123
One chilli free.

331
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:14,563
Shall we pack them up,
we are already late.

332
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:17,101
No, sit,
please sit,

333
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:25,944
So lucky, what's up?

334
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:31,114
Nothing, these riots just ruined
my business,

335
01:06:31,954 --> 01:06:34,184
In these high prices we can't say to
salesmen,

336
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:36,684
that give us riot discount,

337
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:42,396
But you don't worry, anything works
or not you omlett is hit,

338
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:43,793
What should I say?

339
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:48,133
I have to feed entire army free of
coast,

340
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:50,428
Just to stay here,
and all alone,

341
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:52,231
But where is chotia?

342
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:56,767
Since riots are started till he is
not coming here,

343
01:06:58,681 --> 01:06:59,705
I hope he would be safe,

344
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:26,835
If these muslim people didn't started
all then our city won't like that,

345
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,644
Riots are in their blood,

346
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:33,611
We have been taught for tolerate,
and Jihaad for them,

347
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:38,177
then chotia also must be jihaadi,

348
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:43,452
Chotia and Jihaadi,
he can't kill ant,

349
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:47,989
By the way chotia is not like them,
I have seen many muslims,

350
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:49,996
They all are serious with their
religion,

351
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:56,435
I am a muslim,

352
01:07:58,174 --> 01:07:59,698
Good joke,

353
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:03,543
I am notjoking,
it's truth, I am a muslim,

354
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:10,150
This kind ofjoke is dangerous for
you,

355
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,954
You can't say anything,
don't know when...

356
01:08:58,167 --> 01:08:59,691
Give it to chotia when you meet him,

357
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:05,261
Mohsin!
What are you doing here?

358
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:08,399
Carefully!

359
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:15,203
You were saying that dad will come
tomorrow but he didn't come,

360
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:21,874
How come you are here?
I escaped from camp alone,

361
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:23,610
Crazy!

362
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:26,816
You shouldn't wander alone in
mid-night,

363
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:29,457
Come,
you sit,

364
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:32,260
I'll drop you there,
sit,

365
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:41,459
Uncle!
Give me suleman's key,

366
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:48,174
I know who broke suleman's key,

367
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:50,773
But they won't be safe anymore,

368
01:10:52,014 --> 01:10:53,311
I don't understand,

369
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,846
why you people shows much smartness,

370
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,881
Those people are dead,
will they come back,

371
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:02,821
Give me the key,

372
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:12,191
Hey,
Stop!

373
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:15,669
Before leaving drop him to camp,

374
01:11:16,138 --> 01:11:17,230
I can't go to camp.

375
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:19,302
For God Sake show some mercy,

376
01:11:22,478 --> 01:11:23,911
His parents are died,

377
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:26,845
make it fast,

378
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:29,280
Come mohsin,

379
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:31,878
He will drop you to camp,

380
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:34,887
We will come tomorrow to meet you,
along with my father,

381
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:51,072
Look! First drop him to camp,

382
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:54,500
Come on,
open your trunk,

383
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:09,215
We are already late,
haneef will kill me,

384
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:11,558
You wait,
I'll see,

385
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,809
Shut up!
Don't do anything here,

386
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,010
Who is there?
It's me, open up,

387
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:10,437
Who?
What should I do?

388
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:13,574
Yousuf Uncle send him with me,
we have to drop him to camp,

389
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,084
What's your name?

390
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:28,419
Where is the pistol?

391
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:31,892
First of all move this shit,
then I'll find the hidden place,

392
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:36,263
This suleman was a rich man,

393
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:38,230
but what is the mean of money?

394
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:41,943
How he ran away when riots started,
He did it well,

395
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:43,744
It's much better to live with fear
here,

396
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:46,704
You're right,
You will must speak,

397
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:48,772
You were also ran away,

398
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:51,516
don't know how did you sleep between
hindus,

399
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,722
And you must sleep tight between
muslims,

400
01:14:58,393 --> 01:14:59,018
see!

401
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:01,228
He kept his shop's name Parimal,

402
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:04,231
What did he got with hindu name?

403
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:09,136
You didn't find arms anywhere,

404
01:15:09,404 --> 01:15:12,373
But where arms were available that
area was full of corfue,

405
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:17,176
and when you can't breathe with fear
then arms didn't come to your mind,

406
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:21,940
I had alot in my mind,
Rifle, Pistol, Bomb,

407
01:15:23,285 --> 01:15:25,150
but most of all I think about my
mother,

408
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:27,414
I couldn't do anything,

409
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:31,088
My body is still smell with burned
hindus,

410
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:33,718
I still watch dreams of freezed blood,

411
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:47,606
It's too late,

412
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:51,172
Where is your hidden place?
There is no hidden place,

413
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:52,743
He is making us fool,

414
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:03,056
Got it!

415
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:25,844
It's real,
Yes!

416
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,610
It looks small but it's real,

417
01:16:30,886 --> 01:16:32,513
Carefully,
it's loaded with bullets,

418
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:33,716
Open it up,

419
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:44,495
It has nothing.

420
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:47,478
No, leave it,
no need of that,

421
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:50,656
No, nothing happen to me,
I'll do it, no need of that,

422
01:18:52,928 --> 01:18:54,259
Tomorrow nobody will gather here,

423
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:57,229
What do you mean?

424
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:02,328
You were right.

425
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:05,131
And I was wrong,

426
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:24,782
If you will lose your hope then what
will happen with us,

427
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:32,900
Only music have not that guts who
could face this hate,

428
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:03,994
You stay here,
I'll check,

429
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:28,747
don't say anything,
come with me,

430
01:20:33,595 --> 01:20:35,790
Police says that they found arms
in your house,

431
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:48,969
Speak slowly,
everyone will know in house.

432
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:52,636
Look!

433
01:20:53,448 --> 01:20:55,473
Till those people are there,
you stay here,

434
01:21:06,294 --> 01:21:07,158
You want something,

435
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:10,694
Why don't they catch those goons
instead of finding arms in our house,

436
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,098
Lajo will be awake,

437
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:24,836
You still won't tell me,

438
01:21:26,815 --> 01:21:28,544
It's enough,
now stop it,

439
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:40,428
Change your clothes,

440
01:21:45,767 --> 01:21:48,565
To keep silent whom you are saving,
Me or you.

441
01:21:50,005 --> 01:21:51,905
Let it go,
it's easy for you.

442
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:53,305
Your house is not burned,

443
01:21:53,842 --> 01:21:55,469
but you are burning now and
what about that,

444
01:21:56,645 --> 01:22:00,081
Look, you tell me the truth that you
were there, I won't tell haneef,

445
01:22:17,532 --> 01:22:18,260
What did you say?

446
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:23,865
I just tied up,
but I drop it somewhere,

447
01:22:36,985 --> 01:22:38,316
Why did you do that?

448
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:43,687
Tell me,

449
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:46,391
You took cerosine from my kitchen or
you have brought your own,

450
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:37,043
You were saying truth,

451
01:23:37,879 --> 01:23:41,246
Now what you will with pistol,
What I wanted to do all day,

452
01:23:41,983 --> 01:23:44,816
I'll tell that mother fucker mehul
that what is fear.

453
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:47,979
And what next?
Next what, I'll go home.

454
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:49,957
Or whatever has remain in that house,

455
01:23:50,592 --> 01:23:53,561
and what if some people will come
to get your daughter.

456
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:56,194
Then what you will do.
I'll kill them all.

457
01:23:57,432 --> 01:23:59,627
You will waste this bullet on mehul,

458
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:07,598
look! If someone need this pistol
so it's me.

459
01:24:08,443 --> 01:24:10,411
You saw that how police treat us,

460
01:24:10,945 --> 01:24:14,176
but your house ain't burned,
you know my wife is pregnant.

461
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:18,247
One minute, I have brought the shop
key, I fixed the bullet,

462
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:20,453
so it's my right on this pistol.

463
01:24:21,356 --> 01:24:24,018
I've told you from the beginning that
I need arms,

464
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:25,986
and what you done last days,
and what have you done?

465
01:24:26,361 --> 01:24:30,297
You were easily hidden on that place,
Easily hidden? I was scared,

466
01:24:30,965 --> 01:24:33,525
Ask me what you call to live with
fear,

467
01:24:34,135 --> 01:24:36,729
If anyone's right on this pistol then
it's me,

468
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:38,266
Everything is about you,

469
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:40,897
Since I know you always talk
about your self,

470
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:44,111
Hey, you shut your mouth,
how do you know what he felt?

471
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:47,373
And how do you know what I suffered,
Corpse's smell didn't go from my hands,

472
01:24:47,549 --> 01:24:49,574
It doesn't mean that I didn't suffered
anything,

473
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:52,481
leave it, and by the way suleman did
not gave you the keys, but to yousuf,

474
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:55,248
If I would be here then he would
gave me, how he changed,

475
01:24:55,623 --> 01:24:57,887
First you call him wife's slave,
Yes, I said,

476
01:24:58,359 --> 01:25:01,658
You are not less, everyone know
who rules in your house,

477
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:03,597
You take this pistol,

478
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:05,727
Your wife is equalant to 50 bullets.

479
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:19,508
We had only one bullet.

480
01:25:25,987 --> 01:25:28,353
Look,
nothing happened, come here,

481
01:25:40,168 --> 01:25:41,965
What he says?
He is saying he will handle police.

482
01:25:42,103 --> 01:25:45,368
Then let him go they won't let him
speak,

483
01:25:46,374 --> 01:25:48,103
You go and keep police busy.

484
01:26:08,763 --> 01:26:10,890
I can't go to drop goga.

485
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:04,211
Leave him,
he is my brother.

486
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:06,577
You hide here,
I'll come to bring you,

487
01:31:35,556 --> 01:31:38,753
We still have time,
why did you woke up so early.

488
01:31:44,765 --> 01:31:46,756
What happen?
What happen?

489
01:32:11,959 --> 01:32:13,051
What you have said?

490
01:32:15,563 --> 01:32:17,121
I am Sameer Arshad Sheikh,

491
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:21,359
and this thing hasn't gonna change
anywhere,

492
01:32:30,411 --> 01:32:32,003
but what if we will scare again,
