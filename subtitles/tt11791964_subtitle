1
00:00:12,182 --> 00:00:15,377
Because we can't see God,
we won't stop worship.

2
00:00:15,499 --> 00:00:19,076
Because you are not with us,
we won't stop loving you.

3
00:00:19,108 --> 00:00:23,069
This movie is a tribute
to the Smile King

4
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:24,315
who won the war
without fighting.

5
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:19,361
Awesome!
And that's a four!

6
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:22,083
Like I predicted,
RCB is going to win this match!

7
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:26,301
Can you please reduce the smoke?

8
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:27,678
I am not able to see the TV clearly.

9
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,700
Okay, boss.

10
00:01:31,087 --> 00:01:32,086
Take, eat.

11
00:01:32,837 --> 00:01:35,541
Darling, why don't you also join me
in watching this interesting match?

12
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:36,812
Kohli is about to score a 100 runs

13
00:01:36,855 --> 00:01:38,126
his idea of a birthday treat for us,
I guess!

14
00:01:38,158 --> 00:01:40,625
How do I care if someone scores a
century or celebrates his birthday?

15
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:45,586
Looks like my nightingale is
singing out of tune today, no?

16
00:01:45,628 --> 00:01:46,500
Yes, boss.

17
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,866
Baby, are you irked with
me for eating the butter

18
00:01:50,956 --> 00:01:52,121
without offering you?
Have some.

19
00:01:52,615 --> 00:01:55,625
Be it butter or ghee. Eat whatever
the hell you want, like I care!

20
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:57,983
Why are you getting angry?
Only if you tell me

21
00:01:58,054 --> 00:02:00,800
what have I done? I will be
able to correct my mistake, right?

22
00:02:02,127 --> 00:02:06,333
You are my boyfriend, right?
Sit and think what you have done!

23
00:02:07,207 --> 00:02:09,369
Baby, baby..

24
00:02:11,942 --> 00:02:15,580
Now it's impossible to figure out
the reason behind a woman's anger

25
00:02:15,612 --> 00:02:16,612
even after reading the Bhagavat Geetha!

26
00:02:16,662 --> 00:02:19,080
Even after preaching it one is also
unable to decipher the reasons!

27
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:22,255
I should hold a discussion
with Lord Brahma on this topic.

28
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,208
Narayana, Narayana..

29
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:34,417
Narada Muni is here,
go open the door for him.

30
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:40,305
Narayana, Narayana..

31
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:44,369
I offer a warm welcome to the FM
station of all the three worlds!

32
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:45,302
Please make yourself comfortable.

33
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:47,208
So, tell me what brings you here today?

34
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,917
By FM, you mean Radio Jockey, right?

35
00:02:50,043 --> 00:02:51,833
Nope! I mean Fitting Master!

36
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,791
All you do is carry tales from
one person to the other, right?

37
00:02:55,211 --> 00:02:58,712
Narada, while I am very well aware of
your scheme of affairs here in heaven.

38
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,253
I'm curious to know your
game plan for earth dwellers.

39
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:04,561
Well, Krishna, mothers were created
as God can't be everywhere.

40
00:03:04,677 --> 00:03:09,142
Just like that relatives have also
been created to further my cause!

41
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:11,308
In fact, they are way better
than me in my own game!

42
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh, wow!
- By the way, where is your wife?

43
00:03:15,168 --> 00:03:17,927
Don't ask! She seems to be very
upset with me from morning.

44
00:03:18,253 --> 00:03:20,293
She is not even telling me.
- Is it?

45
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:21,627
Can you talk to her and
find out what's wrong?

46
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,125
Definitely, definitely..

47
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:26,625
Darling, baby, Ruku see who is here.

48
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:29,208
Hello! Bhabiji!

49
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:33,959
You didn't have to! I mean today
is your special day after all.

50
00:03:34,228 --> 00:03:35,487
In fact, that's the reason I'm here.

51
00:03:37,392 --> 00:03:40,128
This is wishing you a
very happy birthday!

52
00:03:40,338 --> 00:03:43,769
I've got your favourite red velvet cake
made from Ammaa's Pastry

53
00:03:43,912 --> 00:03:46,305
and that too with extra cheese.

54
00:03:46,757 --> 00:03:48,669
Thank you so much,
that's really sweet of you.

55
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,375
You are welcome.

56
00:03:51,383 --> 00:03:54,745
Darling, happy birthday, my love.

57
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:58,710
OMG! OMG! Krishna, you are yet
to wish her or what? Seriously?

58
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,375
What is he saying?

59
00:04:00,795 --> 00:04:04,507
I mean last month it was Goddess
Parvathi's birthday and Lord shiva

60
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:06,706
planned a conference call and
had all the deities wish her.

61
00:04:06,738 --> 00:04:09,745
Leave that, just two days ago,
Lord Srinivasa

62
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:12,402
threw a lavish party for
Lakshmi on her birthday.

63
00:04:12,728 --> 00:04:14,682
But in your case, your birthday
is almost coming to an end

64
00:04:14,843 --> 00:04:16,692
and he has not even wished you,
you say!

65
00:04:16,892 --> 00:04:20,270
My love, I also wanted to
surprise you but what to do

66
00:04:20,414 --> 00:04:22,338
he came here first
and surprised me only!

67
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,836
You don't love me, that's it.

68
00:04:23,878 --> 00:04:24,918
I do love you.
- No.

69
00:04:25,128 --> 00:04:26,926
I'm going to go to my mom's house.
- Don't.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,208
You should.
Here you go.

71
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:30,772
Leave this place.

72
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,578
But Ruku, Ruku!

73
00:04:33,694 --> 00:04:35,460
Narayana, Narayana!

74
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:41,058
Done is done Krishna, set a reminder
for her next birthday at least.

75
00:04:41,153 --> 00:04:43,836
Anyway, my job here is done.
I'll make a move.

76
00:04:44,246 --> 00:04:48,542
Narada, you turned my milk like family
sour by squeezing lime into it!

77
00:04:50,474 --> 00:04:54,083
See Krishna,
I squeeze lime into lemon rice also.

78
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,539
It's just that that
part goes unnoticed.

79
00:04:58,014 --> 00:05:00,459
I need to do certain things
for greater good.

80
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:02,208
Greater good?
- Yes.

81
00:05:03,006 --> 00:05:05,573
The reason behind this act
of yours is not greater good

82
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:07,589
it's the fact that you are single!

83
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:11,083
So, I today curse you to go to earth

84
00:05:11,293 --> 00:05:14,483
fall in love with a girl
and convince her family

85
00:05:14,765 --> 00:05:17,684
to get you both married.

86
00:05:18,487 --> 00:05:22,037
Only when you do that will you
be allowed to enter heaven.

87
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:23,431
But Krishna, Krishna!

88
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,901
Like I always say, I will come in
every era to reestablish dharma.

89
00:05:29,481 --> 00:05:33,245
And you will fall in love
as that is your karma!

90
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:41,667
OLD MONK

91
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:50,380
I retained all the personality
traits of Narada, my celestial form

92
00:06:50,424 --> 00:06:54,566
even after I came to Earth.

93
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,416
Lord Ganesha, can you see me?

94
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,970
This is my first day at work.

95
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:13,282
I've stepped into my office.

96
00:07:13,787 --> 00:07:16,532
Please ensure that everything
goes smoothly.

97
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,001
Good morning, Sir.

98
00:07:18,043 --> 00:07:19,245
Good morning, come.

99
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:21,708
I wanted to talk to
you about something.

100
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:23,331
We will, first take theertham.

101
00:07:26,127 --> 00:07:27,708
Tell me what's bothering you?

102
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:31,667
Sir, we both love each other.
- You are lovers? Good.

103
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,410
We are planning to
get married as well.

104
00:07:33,655 --> 00:07:36,886
You are marrying the one you love,
even better!

105
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:38,458
Go ahead.
- Thank you, sir.

106
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:41,108
But..

107
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:47,208
Sir, only you can save our
relationship. - Okay, relax, relax.

108
00:07:47,502 --> 00:07:50,875
Your family is against
this alliance, is it? - No!

109
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:53,583
Then is your family not okay
with you marrying him? - No, sir.

110
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,580
Then? - The problem is not our family,
it's this office.

111
00:07:56,664 --> 00:07:58,583
What?
- Office?

112
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:01,848
Sir, our HR is a sadist.

113
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:04,474
He is averse to the idea of
lovers and love marriages.

114
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:07,090
Even if he gets a whiff of the
employees who have fallen in love

115
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,582
he finds ways to terminate them.
He is such a jerk.

116
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:13,003
Sir, we are about to get married.

117
00:08:13,354 --> 00:08:16,816
I can't leave her, then again,
I can't quit this job either.

118
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:20,041
What rubbish, how can one mix something
that is personal with one's profession?

119
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,414
Who is he to stop
you when I am here?

120
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:25,076
I'll look into this issue,
don't worry. You may leave.

121
00:08:25,108 --> 00:08:26,899
Thank you, sir.
- Please go.

122
00:08:27,878 --> 00:08:30,709
What is this, Lord Ganesha?
What is this, PA?

123
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:34,279
Sir?
- What the hell is all this?

124
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,522
Are you saying there are
no couples in this office?

125
00:08:36,586 --> 00:08:39,028
Sir, forget people,
that HR does not even allow

126
00:08:39,087 --> 00:08:40,508
for photos or idols of
couple Gods to be kept.

127
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,375
Meaning?

128
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:44,069
Sir, there is a Ganesha
idol at the entrance, right?

129
00:08:44,238 --> 00:08:49,077
Previously idols of Krishna and Radha
were kept there. But this guy came..

130
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,162
Hi, Krishna, how are you?

131
00:09:17,777 --> 00:09:18,835
Krishna, you are indeed
my favourite God.

132
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:21,626
But that doesn't mean that
you get to break my office rules.

133
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,081
The rules that everyone
but you are following.

134
00:09:24,109 --> 00:09:25,252
Krishna, I even requested
you to break up people

135
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:29,435
who keep falling in and out of love
and help freshers like me find a lover.

136
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,124
But you seem to turn a blind eye.

137
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:34,745
Okay, let me guess, this attitude
of yours may have something to do

138
00:09:34,777 --> 00:09:36,659
with the fact that you
have 16,000 girlfriends

139
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:38,919
and would never understand
the plight of single boys, right?

140
00:09:39,123 --> 00:09:40,917
Then let me also do something to get
across my point strong and clear.

141
00:09:41,322 --> 00:09:42,554
Krishna..
- Sir.

142
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,401
Place Radha's idol on her 30th floor
- Sir!

143
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:48,458
Place Krishna's idol
in the ground floor. - Sir!

144
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:52,293
And here place my boss, Ganesha's idol
and perform pooja everyday.

145
00:09:52,377 --> 00:09:52,942
Sir!

146
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:59,556
And ever since, only bachelor Gods
have made it to screensavers and desks.

147
00:09:59,588 --> 00:10:02,501
Sir, photos are still okay,
imagine my fate

148
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:06,409
as I had tattooed Krishna's name on
my hand just before joining this office.

149
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:07,252
Okay, what happened next?

150
00:10:09,835 --> 00:10:10,918
This is too much.

151
00:10:11,086 --> 00:10:13,959
Sir, that is nothing. I am in
charge of weekend fun activities.

152
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:16,325
I arranged for the
screening of 'Mungaru Male'.

153
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:17,371
Tell me what's wrong with that?

154
00:10:17,403 --> 00:10:19,325
It is wrong all the way.

155
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:21,337
Stop!

156
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:24,541
And that was the last time
any romantic film was screened!

157
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:31,773
Thereafter only films that highlight
brother-sister bond are being screened!

158
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:33,139
But I see a Hindi film has also
been screened. 'Bhai Ka Pyaar'.

159
00:10:33,177 --> 00:10:34,788
Is that a Salman Khan film?

160
00:10:34,988 --> 00:10:37,788
No sir, that is the dubbed
version of a brother-sister film.

161
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,068
It was screened for the benefit
of our north Indian colleagues!

162
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:40,831
Oh God!

163
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,501
Sir, all this is still bearable.
Imagine our plight.

164
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:44,291
We three are mechanical
engineering students.

165
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,224
We came to the IT industry so that
at least in our work space

166
00:10:46,284 --> 00:10:47,539
we can meet girls!

167
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,916
But here this guy expects men
and women to sit separately.

168
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:55,543
Even our restrooms are
on different floors!

169
00:10:55,585 --> 00:10:57,916
Forget that, we thought we could
socialize with them in the parking lot.

170
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,790
But here, lower basement
has been reserved for women

171
00:10:59,842 --> 00:11:01,306
and upper basement parking for men!

172
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:05,039
Sir, I had thought there could not
be a bigger villain than KGF's Garuda.

173
00:11:05,953 --> 00:11:08,626
But when compared to our HR,
even Garuda comes across as humane.

174
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:13,084
At least he allows men and women to
stay in the same place. But our HR!

175
00:11:13,462 --> 00:11:15,633
Cool down.
Calm him down.

176
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:20,315
But did none of you oppose
these draconian rules?

177
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:21,765
Didn't any of you protest?

178
00:11:21,797 --> 00:11:22,999
Sir.

179
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:27,373
I dared to do so.

180
00:11:27,835 --> 00:11:30,707
Excuse me.
What's happening here?

181
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:34,959
I haven't done anything wrong
and you can't do anything to me. - Oh!

182
00:11:35,043 --> 00:11:36,917
I log in at 8 am and log out at 5 pm.

183
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,438
I don't waste time on social media
during working hours.

184
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,959
This is my lunch hour.
She is my friend.

185
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,085
I have the right to socialize
with whomever I want.

186
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:44,047
I don't owe you an
explanation in this regard

187
00:11:44,099 --> 00:11:45,305
You are a HR and you should
limit your role to just that!

188
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:48,372
Excellent. At least you had
the guts to question him.

189
00:11:48,414 --> 00:11:49,747
There is more to this story, sir.

190
00:11:49,831 --> 00:11:52,125
Those who are wrong
carry fear in their hearts. - Hmm.

191
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:53,538
But for those who are right

192
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:56,123
fear is nothing more than
a word in a dictionary.

193
00:11:56,987 --> 00:11:59,936
Very good. Do one thing, have your
parents come meet me tomorrow.

194
00:11:59,998 --> 00:12:00,994
Parents?

195
00:12:01,026 --> 00:12:03,624
We have heard of parents-teachers
meetings in school.

196
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,440
But have you come across
an employee-parent meeting, ever sir?

197
00:12:06,464 --> 00:12:07,081
No way!

198
00:12:07,113 --> 00:12:08,334
But here, that's the norm!

199
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:12,017
Is there a problem?
Did my son do anything wrong?

200
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:12,840
Actually..
- Dad..

201
00:12:12,872 --> 00:12:15,162
You have nothing to worry about.
I have not committed any mistake.

202
00:12:16,488 --> 00:12:18,700
He is right.
He has done nothing wrong.

203
00:12:18,816 --> 00:12:21,173
In fact, he is very punctual.

204
00:12:21,557 --> 00:12:27,631
But here is a screenshot of the footage
captured in the CCTV on our 7th floor.

205
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:29,446
Looks exactly like your son.

206
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:32,717
You smoke?

207
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:36,175
No, Dad, my friends forced me to try.
So it was just a onetime thing.

208
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:38,374
Those were images from
day before yesterday.

209
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,166
Now look at these screenshots
captured yesterday, sir.

210
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,916
They were taken at 10 am,
12pm, 2pm and 4 pm.

211
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,308
If you keep swiping right, you can
spot your future daughter-in-law too!

212
00:12:47,353 --> 00:12:49,480
What daughter-in-law?

213
00:12:49,512 --> 00:12:50,788
That's Nasriyat Begum.

214
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,667
Is she a Muslim?

215
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:53,249
Yes, sir.

216
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,997
OMG! How could you do such a thing?
We are such devout Hindus!

217
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,753
Just because you are
financially independent

218
00:12:57,955 --> 00:12:59,618
doesn't mean you can
do as you please.

219
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:00,713
Sir, he is still young, let it be.

220
00:13:00,877 --> 00:13:03,508
You stay out of this.
I'll handle it my way.

221
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:03,900
Please, sir.

222
00:13:03,974 --> 00:13:06,011
I have given this issue
much thought.

223
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:11,513
From tomorrow all these rules
will be changed.

224
00:13:11,587 --> 00:13:14,999
Going forward you have no one
or nothing to fear in this office.

225
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,388
I'll take care.

226
00:13:16,585 --> 00:13:17,704
For proof..

227
00:13:18,751 --> 00:13:20,034
Hey, the couple standing there,
come here.

228
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,794
They make an adorable couple, right?

229
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:27,166
I'll make sure these two
get married tomorrow.

230
00:13:28,248 --> 00:13:32,208
There is nothing that even that
sadist HR can do to stop me.

231
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,168
And in case he does manage that,
I will..

232
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,708
Hmmmm, right,
I will shave my moustache!

233
00:13:39,044 --> 00:13:41,999
That's a promise and I will
stick to it no matter what!

234
00:13:43,536 --> 00:13:47,251
There is so much exaggeration
about me and my atrocities.

235
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:51,209
But not a single person has cared
to find out why I am the way I am!

236
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,253
Anyway, I'll only tell you why.

237
00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:58,074
Wow, look at these babes!
Who are these new entrants?

238
00:13:58,158 --> 00:14:02,082
Thanks to Lord Krishna's curse,
I crash landed on earth.

239
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:03,427
And just like he had wished

240
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:05,969
I started falling in love
with every other girl I met.

241
00:14:06,631 --> 00:14:09,218
But every time I came close to
impressing her and her family.

242
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:12,151
And return to heaven..

243
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:15,873
You scoundrel, you smart ass.

244
00:14:15,915 --> 00:14:19,776
In every film, the villain makes
an entry only after the interval

245
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,925
but in my film, he marked his
presence right at the start!

246
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:29,791
You can become a doctor, actor,
saint or a mechanical engineer..

247
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,000
Oh! Wait, they are one
and the same thing right!

248
00:14:32,084 --> 00:14:33,719
Anyway, you are free
to do whatever you want

249
00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:37,875
but you have to enter into
an arranged marriage only.

250
00:14:37,914 --> 00:14:40,458
Meet my dad, Narayan.

251
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,780
My father is usually a YES Narayan

252
00:14:42,907 --> 00:14:45,396
when it comes to love and love marriage,
he becomes a NO Narayan.

253
00:14:45,456 --> 00:14:47,457
And No to what extent you ask?
Take a look.

254
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,164
Sir, he is your first born.
- Yes.

255
00:14:50,713 --> 00:14:52,687
He is born with a powerful
star sign too. - Good to know.

256
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,362
Give him a name that
starts with the letter A

257
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:55,730
that will bring him a lot of luck.

258
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:56,666
Why not?

259
00:14:57,107 --> 00:14:59,790
A, okay then, shall we
name him Aryavardhan? - Yes, yes!

260
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,124
Aryavardhan? No way.

261
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,041
I'll think of a good name for him.

262
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,659
Appanna!

263
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,524
Appanna!

264
00:15:08,598 --> 00:15:12,376
But this is such an
old-fashioned name.

265
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,208
Old fashioned my foot!

266
00:15:14,586 --> 00:15:18,958
My decisions are always logical.

267
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:20,418
See tomorrow, when he grows up

268
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,614
he will most likely
be attracted to girls.

269
00:15:22,646 --> 00:15:24,502
When that happens,
the girl will have no choice

270
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:26,775
but to address him as
either Appanna

271
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,702
or brother

272
00:15:29,349 --> 00:15:31,501
and hence he can never be
addressed endearingly as a lover!

273
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:33,624
Appanna, Appanna, Appanna..

274
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,624
Now you know the logic
behind my name, right?

275
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,425
We are a family that prides
over arranged marriages.

276
00:15:37,476 --> 00:15:40,204
So far there has been
no love marriage.

277
00:15:40,404 --> 00:15:48,583
And the man responsible for this is
my great, great, great grandfather.

278
00:15:48,871 --> 00:15:52,001
That sadist died without being
able to make any woman fall for him

279
00:15:52,043 --> 00:15:56,041
and before kicking the bucket
and in the name of 'tradition'

280
00:15:56,167 --> 00:16:00,876
insisted that all the men in the family
should go for arranged marriage only.

281
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,834
In spite of doing this,
I feel his soul is still

282
00:16:02,876 --> 00:16:05,668
not resting in peace and is making its
presence felt through our relatives!

283
00:16:05,701 --> 00:16:08,333
Arranged marriages are
akin to online shopping.

284
00:16:08,543 --> 00:16:10,643
Only after the delivery
is made do we realise that

285
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:14,841
what we order is way different
from what we actually get!

286
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,358
In online shopping,
we at least have the return option

287
00:16:17,474 --> 00:16:18,821
but, in the case,
of arranges marriages

288
00:16:18,983 --> 00:16:21,115
all you are offered
is the adjust option!

289
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,917
But at a very young
age I realised that

290
00:16:22,963 --> 00:16:24,436
arranged marriage was
not my cup of coffee!

291
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:28,166
I had decided mine will be
a love marriage no matter what.

292
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:33,084
Girlfriend, love marriage! No way!
- Why, guruji?

293
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:37,309
His horoscope suggests that he
is not destined to fall in love.

294
00:16:37,383 --> 00:16:40,666
There is nothing but negativity
when it comes to the love department.

295
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,415
This is a result of
bad karmasutra of love.

296
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:43,959
Meaning?

297
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:47,209
Meaning, your time is just not right!

298
00:16:47,293 --> 00:16:49,959
Just like you were responsible
for my breakup with Rukmini

299
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:53,500
I'll be responsible for all your
love stories gone wrong.

300
00:16:53,794 --> 00:16:58,374
Nothing can go right in one's life,
if time is not on your side.

301
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,874
For example

302
00:17:00,338 --> 00:17:02,995
Just like default
mobile wall papers

303
00:17:03,408 --> 00:17:08,422
boys have a default lover,
a close relative's daughter!

304
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:09,458
What?

305
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,255
You will marry me only
know after you grow up?

306
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:16,109
Of course, I will.
- Promise me?

307
00:17:16,561 --> 00:17:17,470
Promise.

308
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:20,284
God promise?
- God promise.

309
00:17:20,795 --> 00:17:21,851
Mother Promise?

310
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:26,540
Hey, swear on your grandmother,
I will get married to you only.

311
00:17:26,582 --> 00:17:28,671
Mom, how could you leave us and go?

312
00:17:30,188 --> 00:17:33,546
How will we live without you?
Mother, mother!

313
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,083
After this episode,
Kirana came into my life

314
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:41,173
Every time we met,
she would teach me something.

315
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:45,165
That's why I called her Gurukiran
, with love of course!

316
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:50,102
Anyways, I finally mustered the courage
to propose to her on Valentine's Day.

317
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:53,958
But while I sat waiting for her,
a girl came walking down the stairs.

318
00:17:54,378 --> 00:17:58,124
Her shoe lace was undone
and I told her that.

319
00:17:58,459 --> 00:18:01,315
She requested me to hold on to a
bunch of roses that she was carrying

320
00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:03,540
so that she could tie the lace.

321
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:07,550
Once she was done,
I gave back the roses.

322
00:18:07,824 --> 00:18:10,490
And the timing could
not have been any worse.

323
00:18:10,606 --> 00:18:12,956
For that's when my Kirana
came towards me.

324
00:18:14,048 --> 00:18:18,256
And just like that my
second love story ended.

325
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,512
When you see a fruit high up on a tree,
you first try to pick it with a stick.

326
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,977
If you fail at it, you don't give
up but climb the tree yourself!

327
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:28,495
My life also took a U turn and I
landed up joining an IT company.

328
00:18:28,537 --> 00:18:31,917
Here, I felt like I was going to
fall in love with every girl I met!

329
00:18:32,015 --> 00:18:33,960
And then one day.

330
00:18:41,627 --> 00:18:43,124
After you, please come in.

331
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,833
I'm seeing you for the
first time in this office.

332
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,959
Yes, it's been only a week
since I reported to work.

333
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,333
Hi, I'm Samskruti.

334
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:49,334
You are lying.

335
00:18:49,376 --> 00:18:50,459
No really, that's my name.

336
00:18:50,543 --> 00:18:51,583
You are Netflix, right?

337
00:18:51,835 --> 00:18:52,500
What?

338
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,874
Okay, then you must be Amazon Prime?

339
00:18:55,252 --> 00:18:55,619
Why?

340
00:18:55,661 --> 00:19:00,041
They can't stop watching
you all day long!

341
00:19:04,301 --> 00:19:06,293
Bro, can you share the
Netflix password with me also?

342
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,541
Meet my BFF, Singh,
Ranveer Singh.

343
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,928
He is a diehard fan
of actor Ranveer Singh

344
00:19:12,971 --> 00:19:15,229
and that explains his dressing sense.

345
00:19:15,586 --> 00:19:17,874
This scene should tell you
all about his character.

346
00:19:18,749 --> 00:19:21,141
Because of him my first office
love story came to an end.

347
00:19:21,168 --> 00:19:22,042
This is how.

348
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,907
Well, it was April Fool's Day

349
00:19:24,225 --> 00:19:26,985
and Ranveer challenged me
that he would prank my girl.

350
00:19:27,293 --> 00:19:28,167
This is what happened next.

351
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,166
Hi, Samskruthi.

352
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:31,750
Hi, Ranveer, what's up?

353
00:19:31,876 --> 00:19:33,458
Nothing much.

354
00:19:33,582 --> 00:19:39,764
The thing is, I know who you were with
and where yesterday.

355
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:47,247
You have gotten it all wrong.
I dined out with Rakesh, that's it.

356
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:48,958
Dinner?

357
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:51,168
Rakesh?

358
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:52,875
Is it true?

359
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:55,500
You are lying to me, Samskruti.
I know.

360
00:19:55,626 --> 00:19:57,041
So, did you see
everything that followed?

361
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:57,500
What?

362
00:19:57,626 --> 00:20:00,248
Hotel? Room, etc..

363
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,538
Etc, etc.. It seems!

364
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:06,309
Listen, please don't tell Appu anything.
Rakesh forced me into it.

365
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:09,854
Please don't tell Appu anything.
I want to get married only to him.

366
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,208
When it came to my love stories, it
seemed like it was always bad timing.

367
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,421
It was only after this incident
did I truly understand

368
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,133
the essence of human relationships
as portrayed in the film 3 Idiots.

369
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:21,617
You feel low when you
are single, of course.

370
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:24,128
But what truly hurts is
the fact that you are single

371
00:20:24,337 --> 00:20:26,231
and all your friends
are in a relationships.

372
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:30,500
So that day I decided to
teach such couples a lesson.

373
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:36,205
Appu, what exactly
do you have in mind?

374
00:20:36,247 --> 00:20:38,530
Until and unless I find myself a
girlfriend, who is worthy of marriage

375
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:40,826
I'll make sure that everyone else
in this office remains single.

376
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:43,339
Bro, that's so unfair! In fact, it's like
expecting temples to be closed down

377
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:45,290
just because your prayers
are not being answered!

378
00:20:45,364 --> 00:20:49,005
While it's not very bothersome if the
entire area faces an electricity failure

379
00:20:49,037 --> 00:20:52,161
but it gets super irritating when there is
power in every other house but yours.

380
00:20:52,203 --> 00:20:55,431
But you need to be in a power
position to execute your plan.

381
00:20:55,476 --> 00:20:57,141
You need to be a team lead at least!

382
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,291
But that requires me to butter
my higher ups and I won't do that.

383
00:20:59,332 --> 00:21:00,625
How about a manager then?

384
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:01,826
That's going to take forever.

385
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,958
CEO?

386
00:21:04,126 --> 00:21:05,538
Not old enough to be one.

387
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,246
What the! Okay. What the hell
do you want to become then?

388
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,875
Let's get back to our
good old college days.

389
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,125
You want to become a don, is it?

390
00:21:17,664 --> 00:21:19,559
Go one step further.

391
00:21:19,957 --> 00:21:25,067
A terrorist?
- Damn, you! Look up.

392
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:34,332
And that explains my behaviour and
that's how I am where I am today.

393
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,003
Now let's get down to business.

394
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:38,560
Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

395
00:21:39,037 --> 00:21:39,829
Who are you all?

396
00:21:39,905 --> 00:21:40,909
I'm a hair stylist.

397
00:21:40,943 --> 00:21:41,867
You mean barber?

398
00:21:41,892 --> 00:21:42,573
Yes, sir.

399
00:21:43,162 --> 00:21:44,054
But as you can see,
I don't need you.

400
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,937
You will need me, sir.

401
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:45,793
How?

402
00:21:45,862 --> 00:21:48,350
You have promised to shave your
moustache if you fail remember

403
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:49,822
so here I am all set for you.

404
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,704
I'm here from
Movers and Packers.

405
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:53,453
What for?

406
00:21:53,495 --> 00:21:56,662
I'm sure you won't have it in
you to stay in your old locality

407
00:21:56,862 --> 00:21:58,935
after facing a miserable defeat.

408
00:21:59,303 --> 00:22:01,545
So I'm here to offer you
our services at a discounted price.

409
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:02,745
I see!

410
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,302
And you would be?

411
00:22:04,576 --> 00:22:06,995
There is no way you'll continue to hold
your position in your current company

412
00:22:07,164 --> 00:22:08,927
after losing this challenge.

413
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:13,833
So, I'm here to collect your resume
so that I can find you suitable jobs.

414
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:14,761
Okay! And you?

415
00:22:14,878 --> 00:22:19,412
What if you go into depression
after failing miserably?

416
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:23,130
I want to be hands-on if that happens.
I'm Dr. Sudarshan, your future psychiatrist.

417
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,540
Are you guys so sure of
this marriage being cancelled?

418
00:22:26,582 --> 00:22:27,867
Of course, sir.

419
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:28,911
No chance!

420
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:16,727
Hi!

421
00:23:17,454 --> 00:23:18,454
Hi, sir.

422
00:23:18,511 --> 00:23:19,270
Who are you?

423
00:23:19,327 --> 00:23:20,871
I'm the HR, sir.

424
00:23:21,249 --> 00:23:22,458
You?
- Yeah.

425
00:23:22,794 --> 00:23:23,249
Yes.

426
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,670
Sir, I was on sick leave yesterday.

427
00:23:24,722 --> 00:23:29,440
But I heard you came to office
yesterday and challenged me.

428
00:23:29,514 --> 00:23:30,583
Hello, listen up!
- Yes, sir.

429
00:23:30,621 --> 00:23:32,411
You are after all a HR.
- Yes, sir.

430
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,703
And I am a board member.
- Yes, sir!

431
00:23:34,739 --> 00:23:36,249
So, you really think you can stop
this marriage from happening?

432
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,916
I'll try me best to do that.

433
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:39,538
I will also see how that's
going to happen.

434
00:23:39,622 --> 00:23:40,916
I will also see!

435
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,010
This is wishing you both
a very happy married life.

436
00:23:43,496 --> 00:23:45,832
So, Arjun...
- Tell me.

437
00:23:45,874 --> 00:23:53,669
(Recites a Sanskrit verse that
describes a particular day)

438
00:23:53,711 --> 00:23:54,375
What?

439
00:23:54,496 --> 00:23:57,206
Looks like our boy here is not
very well aware of Hindu culture.

440
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:01,306
Anyway, where were you
on January 1, 2019?

441
00:24:02,443 --> 00:24:03,460
I will remind you.

442
00:24:03,634 --> 00:24:05,899
You had gone on a trip
to Gokarna with your friends.

443
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:10,883
There were 16 of you on that trip.
But only 15 rooms were available.

444
00:24:11,168 --> 00:24:13,377
Which means one of you had
to become the bigger person

445
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,814
and share a room and
that person was you.

446
00:24:16,014 --> 00:24:18,287
What's wrong with that?
I don't see a problem there.

447
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:19,164
Correct, sir.
Valid point!

448
00:24:19,206 --> 00:24:22,743
It's only decent to step up and
offer help when a girl needs it!

449
00:24:22,785 --> 00:24:26,124
But what's surprising is that someone
who could afford a Rs 2500 room

450
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:29,546
didn't think it fit to spend
an extra hundred bucks

451
00:24:29,578 --> 00:24:31,530
and arrange for an extra bed!

452
00:24:31,749 --> 00:24:35,647
Two weeks later,
I mean just in the span of 15 days

453
00:24:35,704 --> 00:24:37,460
that girl gets a promotion.

454
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:40,750
In a company where you rarely
manage to get only a 10 percent hike

455
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:42,581
a 25 percent hike and a promotion
was given just like that!

456
00:24:42,623 --> 00:24:43,641
Is that true?
- Yes, sir.

457
00:24:43,662 --> 00:24:44,300
Really?

458
00:24:44,407 --> 00:24:46,807
Sir, that girl was
really good at her job.

459
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:47,830
Correct, sir.

460
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:49,946
Later, he even took
on her pilgrimages

461
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:53,494
to Tirupati, Subramanya
and Dharmasthala.

462
00:24:53,694 --> 00:25:00,250
But his prayers went unnoticed I
guess for he failed to win her love.

463
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,600
You see, be it romance,
affair or a screenshot

464
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,523
none of these can be hid for long!

465
00:25:05,917 --> 00:25:09,706
Anyways, that's none of my business.
Happy married life again!

466
00:25:09,748 --> 00:25:10,579
Thank you.

467
00:25:10,621 --> 00:25:12,541
You scumbag! Why the hell
would I marry someone like you?

468
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:13,785
Preeti, Preeti, just hear me out.

469
00:25:13,827 --> 00:25:15,289
Hello, excuse me!
- Preeti!

470
00:25:15,331 --> 00:25:16,541
Hello, just a minute.

471
00:25:18,373 --> 00:25:19,911
To gain knowledge,
we need text books.

472
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:21,333
For money, cheque books.

473
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:23,543
To know about love,
we need hotel invoices!

474
00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:27,043
Bless me Lord Ganesha.
I love bachelor Gods!

475
00:25:27,631 --> 00:25:28,581
I'll see you around then.

476
00:25:28,623 --> 00:25:31,450
I am after all a HR.
What can I do, right, sir?

477
00:25:31,788 --> 00:25:32,459
See you.

478
00:25:48,203 --> 00:25:48,944
Appu!

479
00:25:51,663 --> 00:25:53,609
So, Appu, are you happy?

480
00:25:53,767 --> 00:25:56,690
I had seen you when you were a child,
you have grown so much!

481
00:25:57,058 --> 00:25:58,340
Bro, just check if your zip is open?

482
00:25:59,222 --> 00:25:59,796
Just making sure!

483
00:25:59,828 --> 00:26:00,710
What was that?

484
00:26:00,742 --> 00:26:02,257
I was asking him where the bride is?

485
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:04,443
Why will she be here?

486
00:26:04,693 --> 00:26:05,442
What do you mean?

487
00:26:05,535 --> 00:26:06,976
She is at her place.

488
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:07,894
Her place?

489
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,030
Yes, apparently,
you were okay with this alliance

490
00:26:10,077 --> 00:26:12,594
as long as the elders in
the family approved of it.

491
00:26:12,939 --> 00:26:15,528
That's why your father came
to our place yesterday only

492
00:26:15,683 --> 00:26:17,435
and interacted with our daughter.

493
00:26:18,602 --> 00:26:20,743
Dad, you are playing with my life!

494
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:22,257
What are you grumbling about?

495
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:25,121
No, he was just wondering if you would
have a passport photo of the girl?

496
00:26:25,163 --> 00:26:27,802
He will be content seeing that.

497
00:26:27,847 --> 00:26:29,100
So, if you have one,
can you please show him?

498
00:26:29,132 --> 00:26:31,397
Photo? You think you are old enough
to see a photo and take decisions?

499
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:33,713
You know, I saw your mother's face
only on the day we tied the knot.

500
00:26:33,745 --> 00:26:34,956
She's right here,
you can confirm with her.

501
00:26:35,502 --> 00:26:39,670
Also, I got to see her properly
only four hours after we got married!

502
00:26:39,796 --> 00:26:42,173
Trust! You need to trust, for that's
the crux of a meaningful life dear!

503
00:26:42,274 --> 00:26:43,503
Naani..
- What?

504
00:26:43,543 --> 00:26:45,840
But I knew the boy would want
to see some photos of our girl.

505
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:47,852
So, I brought along
a photo album of hers.

506
00:26:48,136 --> 00:26:50,770
I also knew something like this
would happen! I was 100 percent sure.

507
00:26:50,928 --> 00:26:51,792
Nonsense!

508
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:53,083
Please give.

509
00:26:53,793 --> 00:26:54,812
This was unnecessary.

510
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,998
I hope your father is not forcing
you into a child marriage?!

511
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,419
I have no clue,
why don't you ask him?

512
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,501
Those are school days photos.

513
00:27:10,746 --> 00:27:16,289
This is very nice, do you
have any other photos?

514
00:27:17,213 --> 00:27:20,413
We mean current photos,
present photos..

515
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:24,457
Yey, when current came these
photos were taken. This is correct.

516
00:27:24,573 --> 00:27:27,788
If you talk more, he will
give adhar card, say yes now.

517
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:28,956
What is that?

518
00:27:28,998 --> 00:27:34,495
Nothing, If I get a chance to talk
with the girl it would be great.

519
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,359
That's all he wants.

520
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:36,916
Mr Appanna,
you know what our elders say

521
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,255
talking too much is
bad for the heart

522
00:27:39,286 --> 00:27:42,312
messaging bad for
the mind and internet.

523
00:27:42,563 --> 00:27:45,505
After marriage,
both of you will be together only.

524
00:27:45,593 --> 00:27:46,877
Talk as much as you want.

525
00:27:47,205 --> 00:27:48,413
You keep quiet until then.

526
00:27:48,581 --> 00:27:50,791
Naani.
- Enni, be calm.

527
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:51,457
Nani, keep quiet.

528
00:27:51,499 --> 00:27:53,371
You can talk all you want then.
Till then keep your trap shut!

529
00:27:53,455 --> 00:27:56,790
Actually, I'm sure he has a
solution to this problem as well.

530
00:27:56,874 --> 00:27:57,789
Correct.

531
00:27:59,385 --> 00:28:01,000
In fact, my daughter,
for your sake..

532
00:28:01,084 --> 00:28:01,874
Not mine, just his..

533
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:05,539
Yes, I meant his only, she has
sent you a voice note just for you.

534
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:06,538
Please play it.

535
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:08,520
It's a good thing.

536
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,189
Hi, Appu..

537
00:28:11,613 --> 00:28:13,274
After seeing your photo..
- What is this?

538
00:28:13,306 --> 00:28:14,491
..I couldn't sleep.

539
00:28:15,066 --> 00:28:17,061
You are okay for me.

540
00:28:17,956 --> 00:28:23,663
My daughter is the shy types, so even
her voice notes don't exceed 5 seconds.

541
00:28:23,705 --> 00:28:25,789
That shows how cultured she is!

542
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:28,663
True, true, her voice even
reminded me of S Janaki!

543
00:28:28,831 --> 00:28:31,118
Okay then,
now that you have seen the groom

544
00:28:31,565 --> 00:28:33,862
interacted with him
and even had coffee.

545
00:28:34,307 --> 00:28:37,643
I think its time to make the
next move. Find a priest

546
00:28:37,699 --> 00:28:39,556
and fix a suitable date
for the engagement

547
00:28:39,756 --> 00:28:42,704
I feel you are rushing into this.
I mean at least for formality.

548
00:28:43,114 --> 00:28:44,565
The girl's parents are here.

549
00:28:45,101 --> 00:28:47,663
Let them ask the boy a question
or two and then take a call, right?

550
00:28:47,705 --> 00:28:51,251
That won't be necessary.
We approve of the boy.

551
00:28:51,335 --> 00:28:53,533
Who asked for your approval?

552
00:28:53,575 --> 00:29:00,335
I was referring to ma'am. I see an
element of confusion on her face.

553
00:29:00,503 --> 00:29:03,209
Come on ma'am,
tell me what you want to know?

554
00:29:03,335 --> 00:29:07,013
I was wondering where you got
this work done for your skirt?

555
00:29:07,306 --> 00:29:08,528
It's very trendy.

556
00:29:09,242 --> 00:29:10,261
You want this?

557
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:14,332
See, this is why I kept asking you
to befriend only boys!

558
00:29:14,374 --> 00:29:15,248
You should have..
You mean me?

559
00:29:15,332 --> 00:29:16,746
Right!
- Okay.

560
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,871
Okay, I think the purpose of
our visit has been served.

561
00:29:19,913 --> 00:29:21,620
This is a happy occasion so
what better time than now

562
00:29:21,729 --> 00:29:25,509
to go ahead and
fix the marriage date.

563
00:29:25,709 --> 00:29:27,871
Let's go ahead and plan the wedding
and double our happiness

564
00:29:27,955 --> 00:29:29,663
Yes, that's the priority now.

565
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:33,069
How could they?

566
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:41,250
If you are loafer, I am your father!

567
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:44,983
Mind it!

568
00:29:45,057 --> 00:29:47,456
Okay..
Say okay, bro.

569
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,097
Dude, you got to fall in love
with someone ASAP!

570
00:29:52,297 --> 00:29:54,946
True, or else this father
of mine will get me married

571
00:29:54,978 --> 00:29:57,045
based on voice chats
and video calls!

572
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:57,957
Damn that bloody fellow!

573
00:29:57,998 --> 00:29:59,876
Hello, only I can abuse my father.

574
00:29:59,918 --> 00:30:01,456
Sorry, I could not stop
myself from saying that.

575
00:30:01,498 --> 00:30:02,365
By the way, why are we here?

576
00:30:02,391 --> 00:30:06,889
We are zeroing in on a project
for our company's CSR activity.

577
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:10,448
Since you are our HR,
we need your approval.

578
00:30:10,648 --> 00:30:11,580
And what is this all about?

579
00:30:11,699 --> 00:30:13,205
This initiative is
called Art of Loving.

580
00:30:13,373 --> 00:30:14,746
This is basically
an old age lovers' home.

581
00:30:14,788 --> 00:30:17,057
Old age lovers home?
What is that?

582
00:30:17,173 --> 00:30:21,104
Its purpose is to reunite lovers,
who were separated

583
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:24,769
due to fate's twisted ways.
So here these lovers

584
00:30:25,061 --> 00:30:26,559
are brought together
and their love rekindled.

585
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:30,715
I wish they had such a facility
for youngsters as well.

586
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:32,455
At least people like me would
have benefitted from that!

587
00:30:32,491 --> 00:30:34,395
Nearby Annaporneshwari
Ladies paying guest facility

588
00:30:34,425 --> 00:30:35,623
will solve your problem.

589
00:30:36,665 --> 00:30:37,539
Shut Up!

590
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:40,032
It's so difficult for an
eligible and young man like me only

591
00:30:40,064 --> 00:30:41,592
to impress a girl.

592
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,324
And you are saying these old people

593
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:44,655
manage to reclaim their lost love!
Ridiculous!

594
00:30:46,248 --> 00:30:48,666
That's called talent brother, talent!

595
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,327
As if!

596
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:50,410
Everyone..

597
00:30:50,904 --> 00:30:51,609
What?

598
00:30:52,205 --> 00:30:52,732
Look there.

599
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,697
Hey you!

600
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,281
Bloody oldies!

601
00:32:29,886 --> 00:32:33,784
'What a what a what a..
Colour butterfly!'

602
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,609
'I fell at first sight'

603
00:32:38,245 --> 00:32:40,137
'Sparkling cracker'

604
00:32:40,253 --> 00:32:42,157
'Lit little by little'

605
00:32:42,423 --> 00:32:45,828
'She reached my heart
by climbing the stairs'

606
00:32:46,493 --> 00:32:48,553
'Will you be mine?'

607
00:32:48,849 --> 00:32:50,552
'My red pawn'

608
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:54,782
'Our matching is super fine'

609
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:58,922
'Quick chats
And super-fast posts'

610
00:32:59,232 --> 00:33:02,758
'The corner site
has been booked'

611
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,088
'When you stand beside me'

612
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:07,201
'You shine like the stars'

613
00:33:07,513 --> 00:33:10,888
'Sound the drums!
La La La'

614
00:33:11,537 --> 00:33:13,527
'When you stand beside me'

615
00:33:13,768 --> 00:33:15,557
'You shine like the stars'

616
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,494
'Sound the drums!
La La La'

617
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,239
'When you stand beside me'

618
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,368
'You shine like the stars'

619
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:35,858
'Sound the drums!
La La La'

620
00:33:36,631 --> 00:33:38,487
'When you stand beside me'

621
00:33:38,843 --> 00:33:40,641
'You shine like the stars'

622
00:33:40,849 --> 00:33:44,277
'Sound the drums!
La La La'

623
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,705
I love you.

624
00:33:55,168 --> 00:33:58,663
Me?
- Stop gaping and step aside, dude.

625
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:03,700
Is this for me?
I am totally okay with you.

626
00:34:04,604 --> 00:34:05,628
Please hold this.

627
00:34:06,027 --> 00:34:07,597
Take this, I hope you
will never let go of me.

628
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:11,078
I swear on my mother, I won't.

629
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,505
Oh God, you work in mysterious ways.

630
00:34:13,548 --> 00:34:18,199
We are the winners.
- No ways, we won!

631
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,080
Sorry brother,
it was just a dare.

632
00:34:24,868 --> 00:34:28,705
Thank God, dude, step aside.

633
00:34:30,415 --> 00:34:31,288
Hi.
- Hi.

634
00:34:31,624 --> 00:34:33,540
By the way,
may I know what brings you here?

635
00:34:33,582 --> 00:34:38,335
We are here on official work.

636
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:41,468
May I have a word with you privately?
- Sure.. Please come brother.

637
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,167
Brother? Did I just get bro zoned?

638
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:46,246
Hi. How may I help you?

639
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:47,914
Does this thing work?

640
00:34:50,248 --> 00:34:52,526
He was made like this,
can we cut to the chase.

641
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:56,286
Sorry. Yes, so the thing is..
We are planning a CSR activity..

642
00:34:56,328 --> 00:35:01,129
We are actually here to get more
details about this Swayamvara poster

643
00:35:01,172 --> 00:35:02,824
that's stuck all over the place.

644
00:35:03,024 --> 00:35:07,437
Oops! I am sorry to disappoint you.

645
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:08,196
Yeah.

646
00:35:08,311 --> 00:35:10,828
But that's not for you guys,
its for the elderly.

647
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,831
Come on let's go,
its for the elderly only.

648
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:17,206
You are mistaken, we are here
to enroll for my grandfather.

649
00:35:17,374 --> 00:35:20,221
In that case, please bring your
grandfather at 10 am on the 28th

650
00:35:20,259 --> 00:35:21,940
that's day after tomorrow by the way.

651
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,913
May I know your name?

652
00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:25,918
I am Abhigna.

653
00:35:25,979 --> 00:35:27,204
I am Appu.

654
00:35:27,278 --> 00:35:31,080
And I am the power behind him..
- He is Singh, Ranveer singh.

655
00:35:31,248 --> 00:35:32,705
My colleague..
- I am supposed to be saying it.

656
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:34,830
Yeah, yeah.

657
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:37,663
Okay ma'am, we will leave now.

658
00:35:37,956 --> 00:35:39,746
Okay, it was nice meeting you.
See you soon.

659
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,089
And just one other thing

660
00:35:42,262 --> 00:35:48,182
does anyone in your old age home
have amnesia or alzhimers?

661
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,413
No one.

662
00:35:49,455 --> 00:35:54,455
Knew it, how can anyone forget
your pretty face, otherwise?

663
00:35:54,497 --> 00:35:57,330
Okay. We are leaving.

664
00:35:57,708 --> 00:35:59,288
Please replace this
with a working conch.

665
00:35:59,834 --> 00:36:01,960
Okay, we will leave now
but see on on 28th! - See you, bye.

666
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,288
Appu, take badam milk.

667
00:36:08,498 --> 00:36:12,121
You made badam milk, mom?
What's the occasion?

668
00:36:12,997 --> 00:36:18,274
Nothing much, you are working
day and night, no time for us.

669
00:36:18,348 --> 00:36:20,663
Hence I got something
to drink for you.

670
00:36:20,858 --> 00:36:23,663
I need to work 24/7
to bring my family up.

671
00:36:25,165 --> 00:36:28,916
When you brought badam milk,
I thought there is some matter.

672
00:36:29,195 --> 00:36:32,200
It's just that I heard
things about a certain girl

673
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:38,877
who runs an old age home.

674
00:36:39,108 --> 00:36:40,789
What is happening?
Are you in love?

675
00:36:41,707 --> 00:36:48,163
I don't know if it's love,
but I definitely feel something.

676
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:54,863
Appu, I say this from
my life experience.

677
00:36:56,384 --> 00:36:58,886
There is a world of difference
between love and attraction.

678
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:03,871
If you like someone for their good
qualities, it's nothing but attraction.

679
00:37:04,298 --> 00:37:10,529
But if you accept someone for their
good and bad, that's love!

680
00:37:11,798 --> 00:37:16,246
It's easy to get attracted to someone,
but if it's love, be careful okay?

681
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:24,955
Okay, since we are talking about love,
In fact let me ask you something.

682
00:37:25,331 --> 00:37:26,126
Go ahead.

683
00:37:27,407 --> 00:37:30,859
Have you ever loved anybody
in all these years?

684
00:37:36,674 --> 00:37:38,622
It's funny that you are
asking me a question

685
00:37:38,662 --> 00:37:40,104
that your grandfather
should have asked me.

686
00:37:40,455 --> 00:37:42,651
I don't know if I have
ever been in love

687
00:37:43,631 --> 00:37:45,815
but yes I have been
attracted to someone.

688
00:37:46,477 --> 00:37:47,745
Oh, is it?

689
00:37:48,789 --> 00:37:52,619
You can ask this to old generation.

690
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:56,367
Almost everyone got arranged marriage.
Everyone has the same answer.

691
00:37:56,978 --> 00:38:00,032
Your father was not
the one I wanted to marry.

692
00:38:01,453 --> 00:38:03,458
Not because he is a bad person..

693
00:38:04,318 --> 00:38:07,163
But simply because there are other
good people out there too.

694
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:11,955
Have you not shared this
with anyone before?

695
00:38:12,408 --> 00:38:14,443
No.

696
00:38:16,032 --> 00:38:20,794
Back then it was different.
In our times we didn't have options.

697
00:38:21,284 --> 00:38:24,362
You have the luxury of meeting,
getting to know a person of your choice

698
00:38:24,394 --> 00:38:25,633
you marry the person of your choice.

699
00:38:25,698 --> 00:38:27,879
You also have the choice of divorcing
if things don't work out.

700
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,739
But it was different for us.

701
00:38:30,158 --> 00:38:35,503
Can I decide what you have to wear
for the rest of your life?

702
00:38:35,737 --> 00:38:36,528
It's like that.

703
00:38:39,727 --> 00:38:41,802
I will not interfere
in your love life.

704
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,915
But, you have my
permission to seek love.

705
00:38:45,481 --> 00:38:47,484
Thank you, Mom.

706
00:38:52,408 --> 00:38:53,231
One..

707
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,557
Why do they fear you so much?

708
00:38:57,591 --> 00:38:59,881
Is it? - They tremble at your sight
and run away.

709
00:38:59,913 --> 00:39:00,561
Impressive, huh?

710
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:02,080
But you were not that impressive

711
00:39:02,332 --> 00:39:04,003
yesterday why did you
go into reverse gear?

712
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:06,663
Yesterday, for the first time
I really fell in love.

713
00:39:06,915 --> 00:39:08,489
What about all the other times then?

714
00:39:08,515 --> 00:39:11,637
Just asking.
- This is pure love.

715
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,339
Is that a heart or
ladies beauty parlour?!

716
00:39:15,707 --> 00:39:19,038
Frequently women keep walking
in and walking out, you see!

717
00:39:19,783 --> 00:39:21,637
This time it's fixed.

718
00:39:22,047 --> 00:39:26,302
She's the one for me,
she will be the mother of my kids.

719
00:39:26,837 --> 00:39:28,958
If you are so sure about her,
why didn't you tell her so yesterday?

720
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:33,846
As you know my friend, I don't
exactly have a reputable past.

721
00:39:34,214 --> 00:39:37,183
What if a well wisher from the company
sang glorious praises about my past to her?

722
00:39:37,361 --> 00:39:38,633
So I'm being a bit cautious.

723
00:39:38,665 --> 00:39:41,656
True that. Now where will you
find a grandfather for yourself?

724
00:39:42,189 --> 00:39:44,863
How will I find a grandfather?

725
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:47,538
How about your..
- He's 91..

726
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,330
How about yours?
- 2000.

727
00:39:50,038 --> 00:39:51,746
Hello, good morning, sir.
- Good..

728
00:39:53,371 --> 00:39:54,203
Grandpa!

729
00:39:54,995 --> 00:39:58,961
I extend a warm welcome to all

730
00:39:59,008 --> 00:40:01,614
the participants of
this year's Swayamvara.

731
00:40:01,868 --> 00:40:07,172
The highest scorer in every contest
will be selected for the final round.

732
00:40:07,293 --> 00:40:09,025
Who the hell is Munniswamy?

733
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:09,830
It's me, ma'am.

734
00:40:10,124 --> 00:40:12,343
What sort of rubbish have
you written in sex coloumn?

735
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:14,454
I have written that I'll try, ma'am.

736
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:16,368
Age related constraints, correct ma'am?

737
00:40:16,484 --> 00:40:18,762
You were expected to answer
male or female!

738
00:40:18,878 --> 00:40:19,917
You are rejected.
- Get lost.

739
00:40:35,915 --> 00:40:36,876
Is it you, Ramu?

740
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,915
Yes, Elizabeth.

741
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:47,563
Wait a minute, we don't have the time
for a long flashback. Keep it short.

742
00:40:47,763 --> 00:40:49,458
Our story has progressed from..

743
00:40:52,746 --> 00:41:00,382
Nick name to surname,
for sure it is true love.

744
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:04,065
At least now tell me
those three magical words.

745
00:41:05,244 --> 00:41:07,464
Take care and play.

746
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:08,483
Yes.

747
00:41:13,124 --> 00:41:15,496
Who was that Elizebeth?

748
00:41:18,746 --> 00:41:20,284
My old boyfriend.

749
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,207
Ma'am, we are here.

750
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:28,788
What took you so long?
Decorate the trees with the lights.

751
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:29,538
Ahhh?
- Okay.

752
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:32,783
Ma'am, it's us.

753
00:41:33,326 --> 00:41:36,039
Hi! - Hi.
- You?

754
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:38,695
We have registered our grandfather's
name for the competition.

755
00:41:38,811 --> 00:41:40,831
Okay, but what are
you both doing here?

756
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,789
Ma'am, can I speak
to you in private?

757
00:41:43,873 --> 00:41:47,998
That's a bad pick up line!
I already have a boyfriend.

758
00:41:48,082 --> 00:41:51,080
Thank you, Goddess!
Yes!

759
00:41:52,249 --> 00:41:58,621
That's okay. A cute girl like
you deserves another boyfriend!

760
00:42:05,338 --> 00:42:10,366
The boon was blessed to him,
I will not request in the future.

761
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,624
This is the first
round of Swayamvara..

762
00:42:12,792 --> 00:42:14,166
I will never forget you.

763
00:42:14,664 --> 00:42:20,122
We have kept grains,
greens and veggies.

764
00:42:20,661 --> 00:42:25,620
The contestants should differentiate
between grains, greens and veggies.

765
00:42:25,662 --> 00:42:27,288
God bless us.

766
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,582
This is beans.
- What?

767
00:42:29,666 --> 00:42:31,083
Wait, let me tell you.

768
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:32,457
I cannot hear you.

769
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:33,790
This is tooth powder.

770
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:35,746
That's a good sign, bro,
everyone is doing bad

771
00:42:35,992 --> 00:42:37,435
our man will 100 percent win.

772
00:42:37,635 --> 00:42:40,660
I'll be happy if our man doesn't panic
and ask the way to the bathroom!

773
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:41,356
Exactly.

774
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:44,456
Identify the items
which are kept here.

775
00:42:44,582 --> 00:42:46,910
Ramanna! Ramanna! Ramanna!

776
00:42:46,952 --> 00:42:53,746
Rangoli powder, detergent powder,
and also you have kept brown sugar.

777
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:54,995
And this?

778
00:42:55,037 --> 00:42:58,097
And you have put this
here to confuse us.

779
00:42:58,548 --> 00:43:01,308
You've plucked leaves from this
rando tree and kept it here.

780
00:43:01,508 --> 00:43:05,248
Hey, he is telling
all incorrect things.

781
00:43:05,878 --> 00:43:08,456
If we don't escape now, we'll get
stoned to death. Let's please scoot.

782
00:43:08,488 --> 00:43:09,530
You say so?

783
00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:10,289
Hello!

784
00:43:10,373 --> 00:43:11,083
What is this?

785
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:14,163
Why are you showing me
a colour paper wrapped ball?

786
00:43:15,706 --> 00:43:16,790
Colour paper!

787
00:43:16,832 --> 00:43:20,171
This one is.. Red radish!

788
00:43:20,665 --> 00:43:22,205
You are the sure shot
champions this time!

789
00:43:22,373 --> 00:43:24,507
100 percent, you will win!
- Wait..

790
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:28,751
I am tired helping him.
Will he win?

791
00:43:28,825 --> 00:43:31,835
There should be a way to make him win.
Whatever we try he won't win.

792
00:43:31,915 --> 00:43:34,455
No way.
My head is already spinning.

793
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:37,830
Hi.
- Hi, take this.

794
00:43:38,455 --> 00:43:43,708
Didn't I tell you, bro?
Eventually the girl will accept.

795
00:43:44,498 --> 00:43:47,628
I like the old school
love letter approach.

796
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,554
It shows you are traditional.

797
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:50,366
And this is for you.

798
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:51,745
Is this love towards me as well?

799
00:43:51,819 --> 00:43:54,164
Shut up and sign.
- Sign?

800
00:43:54,874 --> 00:43:57,676
It's an organ donation form,
after you die

801
00:43:57,848 --> 00:44:00,920
the functional parts of your body
will be given to those who need it.

802
00:44:01,456 --> 00:44:04,666
They can get a new life,
at least they can be given life.

803
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:08,373
In a way, every boy from
Karnataka is an organ donor.

804
00:44:08,415 --> 00:44:09,544
Huh?
- Yeah.

805
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:13,107
We give our heart to girls
even when they don't ask for it.

806
00:44:13,391 --> 00:44:15,371
We'll give away our entire
body parts that too in a jiffy.

807
00:44:15,749 --> 00:44:17,463
Give it to me..

808
00:44:18,671 --> 00:44:19,292
Thank you.

809
00:44:20,956 --> 00:44:21,413
What about you?

810
00:44:21,455 --> 00:44:24,166
My name is Mukesh. From my childhood
I have had a hole in my heart.

811
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:26,708
Tar in my liver and stone in my
kidney. Do you still require it?

812
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:27,971
Are you still alive?
- Shut up and sign!

813
00:44:28,003 --> 00:44:28,768
Okay, okay.

814
00:44:28,912 --> 00:44:29,655
Just a minute.

815
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:33,690
I hope the organs
will be scooped after my death?

816
00:44:33,808 --> 00:44:35,544
Sure.
- Okay, take it. See you.

817
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:36,622
Scooped?

818
00:44:36,953 --> 00:44:40,623
Under any circumstance,
I want Ramu to win the Swayamvara.

819
00:44:40,665 --> 00:44:41,081
Mom?

820
00:44:41,123 --> 00:44:42,998
He is my first love.

821
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:45,040
First love or last love,
all are the same!

822
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:47,959
I don't care what you do,
he should win.

823
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:49,943
Otherwise,
in spite of being a diabetic

824
00:44:50,094 --> 00:44:54,036
I'll eat one whole tub
of ice cream and die!

825
00:44:54,954 --> 00:44:55,999
Headache!

826
00:44:56,747 --> 00:44:59,790
Now we are in the third round.
Lemon rice, lemon rice.

827
00:45:00,165 --> 00:45:01,622
This is a simple round.

828
00:45:02,084 --> 00:45:04,290
Evryone needs to tell
how lemon rice is made?

829
00:45:04,458 --> 00:45:07,206
Fine bye, come on, let's go.
- Hey, why?

830
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:11,039
This is exactly what he will say now..
- What? Add rice to the cooker.

831
00:45:11,081 --> 00:45:12,914
Very easy.
Add rice to the cooker.

832
00:45:13,334 --> 00:45:15,123
What did I tell you?

833
00:45:15,207 --> 00:45:17,895
Sorry. Wash the rice first

834
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:20,839
and then add coriander,
curry leaves, onions and tomato.

835
00:45:21,091 --> 00:45:23,992
Then squeeze lemon and
close the cooker lid.

836
00:45:24,024 --> 00:45:25,708
Yeah! Cooker will blast!

837
00:45:26,178 --> 00:45:28,834
Listen to me, he is not reliable.
- Excuse me!

838
00:45:29,374 --> 00:45:30,914
Please step aside,
I want to talk to you.

839
00:45:30,956 --> 00:45:33,039
Okay, she wants to talk to
me it seems, step aside.

840
00:45:33,207 --> 00:45:35,127
Not you brother, you come.
- Brother? - Me?

841
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:39,571
What have you taken me for?
I don't accept this.

842
00:45:39,645 --> 00:45:41,362
Shhh shhh.
- I am here to play fair and square.

843
00:45:41,581 --> 00:45:42,997
What shh shhh?

844
00:45:45,754 --> 00:45:49,039
If anybody bothers you with questions
like those just let me know okay?

845
00:45:49,863 --> 00:45:52,455
It won't turn into a problem, right?

846
00:45:52,497 --> 00:45:55,206
I am the one who usually
creates problems.

847
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:57,042
But I'm on your side.
So there won't be any problems.

848
00:45:57,339 --> 00:45:58,696
You want my grandpa to win,
isn't that so?

849
00:45:58,738 --> 00:46:00,438
I will make sure he does.
- Okay.

850
00:46:00,748 --> 00:46:02,571
Stop!
- Do you want grandpa to win or not?

851
00:46:02,604 --> 00:46:03,995
Okay I'll hold your finger.

852
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,290
I saw it.

853
00:46:08,122 --> 00:46:11,455
The final round is
called hide and seek.

854
00:46:13,413 --> 00:46:16,872
In this round participants
will be blindfolded.

855
00:46:18,538 --> 00:46:22,247
Friends, on the other side
there will be girls standing.

856
00:46:23,291 --> 00:46:28,414
Who will hold the bride hand and
recognise her they will be the winner.

857
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:33,047
Whoever wins gets hundred points

858
00:46:34,251 --> 00:46:37,193
So lets start hide and seek.

859
00:47:44,025 --> 00:47:47,681
'The girl who opposed has proposed now'

860
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:52,264
'Giccha Gili Gili
My life's the finest there is'

861
00:47:52,781 --> 00:47:56,471
'She wants to marry me, you know'

862
00:47:57,012 --> 00:48:01,170
'Giccha Gili Gili
My life's the finest there is'

863
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:05,219
'Behind her I went
and got drugged'

864
00:48:05,744 --> 00:48:09,596
'Today she has opened her heart to me'

865
00:48:10,068 --> 00:48:14,120
'Giccha Gili Gili
My life's the finest there is'

866
00:48:32,056 --> 00:48:35,756
'Last year I saw this year
at the fair'

867
00:48:36,361 --> 00:48:40,106
'I fell for her
when I saw her playing swing'

868
00:48:45,326 --> 00:48:48,799
'Last year I saw this year
at the fair'

869
00:48:49,454 --> 00:48:53,102
'I fell for her when I
saw her playing swing'

870
00:48:53,778 --> 00:48:57,540
'I had challenged my friends'

871
00:48:58,175 --> 00:49:01,941
'That I would make her
fall for me'

872
00:49:02,555 --> 00:49:06,478
'Made fun of guys
and impressed her'

873
00:49:06,998 --> 00:49:10,604
'Feels like a Ladu has fallen
into my mouth from nowhere'

874
00:49:11,246 --> 00:49:15,184
'Giccha Gili Gili
My life's the finest there is'

875
00:49:15,737 --> 00:49:19,461
'The girl who opposed has proposed now'

876
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:24,000
'Giccha Gili Gili
My life's the finest there is'

877
00:49:33,143 --> 00:49:36,868
'She tattooed my name on her hand'

878
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:41,199
'She's carved 'YES'
big like a rangoli'

879
00:49:41,947 --> 00:49:45,654
'My heart is happy
and warm as ever'

880
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:49,911
'I'll go on a fast for her
every Saturday'

881
00:49:50,508 --> 00:49:54,388
'The result of virtuous deeds of my previous lives
That's how I got her in this life'

882
00:49:54,876 --> 00:49:58,737
'She escaped a thousand eyes
to come to me'

883
00:49:59,237 --> 00:50:03,259
'Giccha Gili Gili
My life's the finest there is'

884
00:50:03,598 --> 00:50:07,394
'The girl who opposed has proposed now'

885
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,923
'Giccha Gili Gili
My life's the finest there is'

886
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:16,181
'She wants to marry me, you know'

887
00:50:16,695 --> 00:50:20,737
'Giccha Gili Gili
My life's the finest there is'

888
00:50:23,803 --> 00:50:25,410
Hey, out!
What's all this?

889
00:50:25,681 --> 00:50:27,982
A girl has fallen for him
and the duet song is also over.

890
00:50:28,056 --> 00:50:29,076
What are you doing?

891
00:50:29,118 --> 00:50:32,121
Wait up, bro.
Sorry, God.

892
00:50:32,205 --> 00:50:35,538
Let's first feed him the goodies
and when he's eaten a bit too much

893
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:38,292
we will sit back and have fun
watching him get the loosies!

894
00:50:38,332 --> 00:50:41,713
Wait and watch.
Not this watch, the other one..

895
00:50:53,163 --> 00:50:54,922
Sir, it is being speculated
that the fire mishap

896
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:57,247
that happened yesterday at
KR Mills is not an accident.

897
00:50:57,659 --> 00:50:59,037
What are your thoughts on it?

898
00:50:59,121 --> 00:51:02,080
All this is part of politics.
People politicize everything.

899
00:51:02,668 --> 00:51:05,618
They never feel others' misery

900
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:09,613
unless something
similar happens to them.

901
00:51:10,091 --> 00:51:13,491
I don't indulge in rumors, instead

902
00:51:14,486 --> 00:51:16,926
let's talk about how I plan
on helping the victims.

903
00:51:18,371 --> 00:51:23,538
I will be giving 2 lakh rupees
to every victims' family.

904
00:51:23,874 --> 00:51:25,997
Are you giving this to the
families of all the 15 victims?

905
00:51:29,344 --> 00:51:31,082
The death toll is not 15.

906
00:51:33,588 --> 00:51:35,965
It's 16..

907
00:51:37,356 --> 00:51:40,633
The police have found another
dead body today morning.

908
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:45,163
Is he the villian?
- No. It's his dad.

909
00:51:45,691 --> 00:51:48,163
Show me the villian.
- Play the villain music.

910
00:51:48,788 --> 00:51:53,035
The supreme court has intervened

911
00:51:53,632 --> 00:51:57,965
I now cannot contest in
the upcoming by-election

912
00:51:57,986 --> 00:52:00,285
because of the ongoing bribery case.

913
00:52:00,485 --> 00:52:03,747
My responsibility as the alumni head
comes to an end this year

914
00:52:03,831 --> 00:52:06,163
few days ago
who passed away by a tragedy

915
00:52:06,205 --> 00:52:09,747
our friend Kokila Mohan..

916
00:52:09,789 --> 00:52:11,781
We have decided to build a block
in the name of our friend.

917
00:52:11,803 --> 00:52:13,109
At the same time

918
00:52:14,994 --> 00:52:19,328
it's difficult to make a
new candidate contest and win.

919
00:52:19,579 --> 00:52:22,023
I have finished my term.

920
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:27,360
My responsibilities will
be handled to the next one.

921
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,412
We need a powerful candidate.

922
00:52:30,454 --> 00:52:33,496
He is a gold medalist in Political
Science, Harvard University.

923
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:39,997
I will back him up.
He will be an able representative.

924
00:52:40,039 --> 00:52:43,204
Even though he had several
opportunities in American, he left them.

925
00:52:43,246 --> 00:52:47,633
Politics is like snake and ladder game.

926
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:51,911
He gave it all up to come back to our
nation and to serve our own people.

927
00:52:51,953 --> 00:53:00,993
Like a mongoose he will climb
the ladder and kill the snake.

928
00:53:01,037 --> 00:53:04,791
So let's welcome Shashank
Radhakrishna on stage please.

929
00:53:35,536 --> 00:53:36,910
Did you recognize me?

930
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:38,972
I know you are my junior.

931
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:44,456
In the college during the speech..?

932
00:53:44,698 --> 00:53:45,498
With the script?

933
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,414
It's not you?

934
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,080
Guess, there is some confusion.

935
00:53:48,416 --> 00:53:52,703
Anyways, thanks for coming.
Good Luck. See you soon.

936
00:53:52,745 --> 00:53:53,830
Okay. Take care.

937
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:58,873
Nothing is an accident,
nothing is forgotten either.

938
00:54:00,011 --> 00:54:04,667
I have waited for
this day for years.

939
00:54:05,907 --> 00:54:10,163
The real game begins now.

940
00:54:17,158 --> 00:54:18,621
You are waking up to some good news.

941
00:54:18,663 --> 00:54:20,326
My dad's back from the US.

942
00:54:21,203 --> 00:54:25,120
I have told him about us,
he's got no problem with it.

943
00:54:25,204 --> 00:54:27,667
He wants to meet you once.

944
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:32,788
So prep yourself and come to
Coffee Day at sharp 10.

945
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:34,941
Okay, Coffee Day.

946
00:54:40,832 --> 00:54:43,621
Hi, father- in- law, I am Appu.

947
00:54:43,663 --> 00:54:45,907
I work for a software company as an HR.

948
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:54,203
Sir, my name is Appanna..
No, it's tasteless.

949
00:54:55,953 --> 00:54:58,997
Oops! Why did this moron come here?

950
00:55:01,499 --> 00:55:05,452
It'll all be over if he finds out
I am in love now.

951
00:55:06,785 --> 00:55:10,580
Why is he here? Hope he doesn't
find out about my daughter's love.

952
00:55:11,618 --> 00:55:13,205
Come back later,
I am waiting for for someone.

953
00:55:13,494 --> 00:55:14,823
He has sent you a note.

954
00:55:42,161 --> 00:55:44,788
Hi!
- Hi, Dad.

955
00:56:00,582 --> 00:56:01,610
This is my dad.

956
00:56:05,289 --> 00:56:09,621
Dad, after these incidents,
how can we go further.

957
00:56:09,663 --> 00:56:14,263
Do you know why I was okay
with you being in love

958
00:56:14,858 --> 00:56:18,499
without asking any further questions?

959
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:24,075
Because I thought you make better
decisions than me. But I was wrong.

960
00:56:24,117 --> 00:56:29,910
If you are adamant about
marrying him, go ahead.

961
00:56:29,952 --> 00:56:31,577
But I won't be okay with it.

962
00:56:31,703 --> 00:56:35,019
I want a son, not a son-in- law...

963
00:56:36,178 --> 00:56:36,822
There is more to it..

964
00:56:36,869 --> 00:56:40,038
Dad, please let's stop the argument.

965
00:56:40,369 --> 00:56:46,409
He has loved me for a year,
but you have loved me for 25 years.

966
00:56:46,787 --> 00:56:50,334
Even after 10 years,
your love will be more.

967
00:56:51,253 --> 00:56:54,152
Every girl's first hero is her dad.

968
00:56:54,994 --> 00:57:01,495
This wedding will happen
only with your permission..

969
00:57:01,537 --> 00:57:05,177
Listen up, it's your responsibility
to make my dad like you.

970
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:08,535
I'll be waiting outside.

971
00:57:11,332 --> 00:57:15,037
My goodness. I am happy now.

972
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:19,622
My daughter has got a proposal
from an ex minister's son.

973
00:57:19,664 --> 00:57:22,167
But that's not the bad news,
the bad news is that

974
00:57:22,784 --> 00:57:25,689
they are investing in your company.

975
00:57:26,165 --> 00:57:28,530
Even that's not bad news enough

976
00:57:29,038 --> 00:57:33,792
their only condition to invest

977
00:57:34,814 --> 00:57:38,116
is to kick you out of the company.

978
00:57:38,666 --> 00:57:43,116
Unbelievable?
I'll call them, talk to them.

979
00:57:46,038 --> 00:57:47,120
Hello..
- Hi, sir.

980
00:57:47,682 --> 00:57:49,437
Based on few complaints
by employees

981
00:57:49,555 --> 00:57:52,329
the new CEO ordered you terminated.

982
00:57:52,656 --> 00:57:53,569
I'm sorry, sir.

983
00:57:56,697 --> 00:58:02,012
I just nodded my head and they
have printed the invitation cards.

984
00:58:02,337 --> 00:58:05,042
He is 1000 times better than you.

985
00:58:05,663 --> 00:58:11,263
You prove me that you're one percent
better than him in anything.

986
00:58:11,553 --> 00:58:14,058
Then let's think about it, see you.

987
00:58:14,955 --> 00:58:17,192
Oh, I forgot.

988
00:58:18,713 --> 00:58:21,888
I am just a girl's father.

989
00:58:22,455 --> 00:58:24,861
I can do only this much, see you.

990
00:58:43,172 --> 00:58:44,627
For the hero of a college

991
00:58:45,072 --> 00:58:47,449
only the heroine knows about him.

992
00:58:48,019 --> 00:58:49,158
But the villian of the college

993
00:58:49,495 --> 00:58:51,247
is known by everyone in the college.

994
00:58:51,932 --> 00:58:54,555
So I was kind of a bad boy.

995
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:58,700
Everyone hated us in college.

996
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:01,930
We hated lovers.

997
00:59:02,552 --> 00:59:06,302
So we found a game
to split lovers.

998
00:59:08,762 --> 00:59:13,342
That day I got hold of
Shashank Radhakrishan.

999
00:59:14,192 --> 00:59:15,925
In in the midst of so many girls

1000
00:59:16,077 --> 00:59:20,643
the contest was to find out
who his girlfriend was.

1001
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,735
But unfortunately..

1002
00:59:53,221 --> 00:59:55,781
I wouldn't have minded
if you had insulted me

1003
00:59:56,482 --> 00:59:58,595
but you insulted my love.

1004
00:59:59,518 --> 01:00:02,180
I will teach you a lesson.

1005
01:00:03,238 --> 01:00:06,221
Sorry, we don't attend those classes.

1006
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:11,892
You will fall in love one day.

1007
01:00:12,659 --> 01:00:16,191
She will your life
and I will come for you.

1008
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:20,451
I dare you to marry
the one you love.

1009
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:23,607
Was the invitation card proper?

1010
01:00:23,968 --> 01:00:25,653
Let me know if there
are any corrections

1011
01:00:25,691 --> 01:00:27,112
I'll correct it send it to you.

1012
01:00:27,204 --> 01:00:29,372
See Appu, I am back.

1013
01:00:29,827 --> 01:00:37,164
You won't find a job as I have
black listed you in every IT company.

1014
01:00:37,776 --> 01:00:40,084
You don't even have the wealth

1015
01:00:40,466 --> 01:00:45,294
to start a business because
you are from middle class.

1016
01:00:46,399 --> 01:00:50,247
You can steal or do
anything illegal..

1017
01:00:50,828 --> 01:00:52,742
You're a middle class man and leading

1018
01:00:52,827 --> 01:00:55,002
a respectful life means
everything to your kind!

1019
01:00:55,201 --> 01:00:58,441
So I gave it a good thought
and decided to

1020
01:00:58,577 --> 01:01:00,534
give you a peon job in my office.

1021
01:01:02,789 --> 01:01:03,911
Here, take this card.

1022
01:01:05,582 --> 01:01:07,937
Keep it carefully.
Don't lose it, you know.

1023
01:01:08,115 --> 01:01:10,714
You have been having a bad time.

1024
01:01:11,241 --> 01:01:16,330
You will find people who will
set the watch right, not the time.

1025
01:01:17,503 --> 01:01:18,449
See you.

1026
01:01:18,859 --> 01:01:21,997
Sorry.. I keep meeting you.

1027
01:01:30,995 --> 01:01:34,872
As I am jobless,
I was thinking about my career too.

1028
01:01:34,956 --> 01:01:38,290
I wondered if I should
open a departmental store.

1029
01:01:38,452 --> 01:01:43,007
A tea shop may be or a food kiosk
to impress my father-in-law?

1030
01:01:43,541 --> 01:01:46,914
But you are right about
middle class mentality.

1031
01:01:47,124 --> 01:01:52,162
Our problem is we have
grown up to embrace compromises.

1032
01:01:52,246 --> 01:01:54,287
Our wallets are filled
with papers and not money.

1033
01:01:54,329 --> 01:01:56,079
We have more debts than assets.

1034
01:01:56,121 --> 01:01:58,153
We like an item
based on its price.

1035
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:00,380
And we order the dish
looking at its cost.

1036
01:02:00,442 --> 01:02:06,164
All the hard work and
effort if we find a girl

1037
01:02:06,584 --> 01:02:12,122
a rich brat waltz in and
tries to steal the girl.

1038
01:02:12,332 --> 01:02:13,664
Think you can get away with it?

1039
01:02:13,748 --> 01:02:19,161
I suffered 10 years
to see you suffer.

1040
01:02:19,203 --> 01:02:20,498
You want revenge.

1041
01:02:20,741 --> 01:02:23,023
I want to impress my father-in-law
and get the girl what to do.

1042
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:28,488
Oh yeah! You are contesting
the elections right?

1043
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:34,580
I will contest from the same area
as you and win the elections.

1044
01:02:36,703 --> 01:02:37,872
What if you don't win?

1045
01:02:38,914 --> 01:02:41,789
In that case I swear I'll make
sure you also don't win.

1046
01:02:42,134 --> 01:02:42,999
And what if you don't
succeed in that?

1047
01:02:43,033 --> 01:02:45,695
Then I'll be your
best man at your wedding.

1048
01:02:46,892 --> 01:02:53,031
This is not child's play,
this is politics!

1049
01:02:55,309 --> 01:02:57,935
You are after all middleclass.

1050
01:02:57,993 --> 01:03:00,703
Bro. You should know something
about us middle class people then.

1051
01:03:00,983 --> 01:03:05,904
We may not do things
that are expected of us.

1052
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:12,067
We like to do things that
people say we cannot!

1053
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,705
How about a little trivia for you?

1054
01:03:15,385 --> 01:03:18,584
50 percent of our population
is middle class.

1055
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:19,921
So.

1056
01:03:23,405 --> 01:03:25,623
I am already in the majority.

1057
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:29,307
Bye for now.

1058
01:03:31,329 --> 01:03:34,707
I will come in every era to
reestablish dharma and love.

1059
01:03:35,196 --> 01:03:36,254
Take a short break.

1060
01:03:38,037 --> 01:03:41,872
Krishna, popcorn?
- Hey, its a break time.

1061
01:03:49,246 --> 01:03:50,268
Are you happy now?

1062
01:03:50,315 --> 01:03:54,125
So you somehow managed to
get Radha to stand beside you?

1063
01:03:54,746 --> 01:03:56,630
Krishna,
I'll directly come to the point.

1064
01:03:56,674 --> 01:03:58,710
See, I don't want to be
at logger heads with you.

1065
01:03:58,746 --> 01:04:01,333
So why don't we reach a compromise?

1066
01:04:01,581 --> 01:04:06,380
Like you know, I've to live to the hype
which I gave before the interval.

1067
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,854
It's the question of heroism
and my reputation also.

1068
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:11,331
You only have to save me.

1069
01:04:12,163 --> 01:04:14,752
Come on now, Krishna! It's not like
you are my girlfriend and you are trying

1070
01:04:14,813 --> 01:04:17,641
to take revenge for
something I did or said.

1071
01:04:17,749 --> 01:04:19,863
At least you tell him
to be nice to me, Radha.

1072
01:04:20,063 --> 01:04:22,191
Please Krishna,
please accept my apologies and

1073
01:04:22,219 --> 01:04:23,692
indicate in some way
that you are on my side.

1074
01:04:23,747 --> 01:04:27,038
Sir, we have arranged
a send off party for you.

1075
01:04:27,286 --> 01:04:29,044
Can you please come
and cut the cake.

1076
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:30,622
Sure, definitely.

1077
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:34,455
Krishna, please help me, please.

1078
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:37,415
Hi.

1079
01:04:57,462 --> 01:04:58,872
You know, I mean..

1080
01:05:00,082 --> 01:05:01,271
Mr Appana..

1081
01:05:02,568 --> 01:05:05,101
You must be wondering why no one
is coming forward to take the cake.

1082
01:05:06,038 --> 01:05:08,955
Well, this is what you have earned
in this company over the years!

1083
01:05:11,331 --> 01:05:14,103
What matters more is not what
you say when in front of someone

1084
01:05:14,217 --> 01:05:17,086
but what you say behind their back!

1085
01:05:18,788 --> 01:05:24,365
Neither wealth nor looks
define a man's worth.

1086
01:05:24,646 --> 01:05:27,397
What matters most is his personality!

1087
01:05:28,581 --> 01:05:32,327
Sir, I heard you have plans of entering
politics after quitting this job.

1088
01:05:32,576 --> 01:05:33,472
Al the best.

1089
01:05:33,577 --> 01:05:35,584
350 employees of this company
are eligible to vote for you

1090
01:05:35,645 --> 01:05:36,972
but of course none of us will!

1091
01:06:08,788 --> 01:06:12,038
You all must be wondering
why I am eating this cake.

1092
01:06:12,788 --> 01:06:14,040
My teacher used to say.

1093
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:19,613
You don't have to teach insects to
imbibe their natural characteristics.

1094
01:06:20,203 --> 01:06:24,611
But when it comes to humans, well,
even if a lifetime is spent teaching us

1095
01:06:24,651 --> 01:06:29,663
how to be humane, not every
time do we succeed in doing so!

1096
01:06:29,913 --> 01:06:35,747
And going by how you all behaved today,
looks like he was absolutely right!

1097
01:06:37,623 --> 01:06:42,981
You see those boys there? They were
appointed during the time of recession.

1098
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:46,202
Despite them,
being mechanical engineers

1099
01:06:46,316 --> 01:06:49,425
they were offered
a job in an IT company!

1100
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:52,437
Just because your HR was
concerned about their future

1101
01:06:52,479 --> 01:06:54,097
as it was already three years
since they had completed engineering

1102
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:57,217
and they were jobless in
spite of being capable.

1103
01:06:57,451 --> 01:06:59,462
He ensured that they were hired.

1104
01:06:59,538 --> 01:07:01,642
So ya, that's one mistake your HR made!

1105
01:07:02,539 --> 01:07:03,697
Now, let's come to this girl.

1106
01:07:04,003 --> 01:07:06,223
Her mother was admitted
to a hospital last month.

1107
01:07:06,954 --> 01:07:13,296
Her medical insurance had expired,
but the company took care of the bills.

1108
01:07:13,777 --> 01:07:14,544
How?

1109
01:07:15,535 --> 01:07:18,247
After finding out that her
mother was a single parent

1110
01:07:18,711 --> 01:07:20,906
he bore all the medical expenses.

1111
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,199
When I asked him why he was
bending the rules, he simply said

1112
01:07:23,283 --> 01:07:30,038
he would have done the same for
his family. This was his other mistake!

1113
01:07:30,955 --> 01:07:32,798
Yes, he is erred a couple of times.

1114
01:07:33,209 --> 01:07:36,134
But then again is there anyone here,
who has not made mistakes at all?

1115
01:07:36,706 --> 01:07:39,163
Listen, it's still okay if you
don't get the best employee awards.

1116
01:07:39,819 --> 01:07:42,288
But do strive harder to become
good human beings first.

1117
01:07:59,288 --> 01:08:02,286
No need for so much drama!
Then even I'll get emotional

1118
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:05,930
Even I know,
I haven't been all that nice to you.

1119
01:08:06,159 --> 01:08:08,615
Sir, it's not like we have been
on our best behaviour either!

1120
01:08:09,746 --> 01:08:12,075
We had something to tell you.

1121
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:13,206
What?

1122
01:08:13,374 --> 01:08:15,224
Sir, book a cab for yourself today.

1123
01:08:15,281 --> 01:08:16,215
Don't take your car, please.

1124
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:19,028
Cab? Why?
- Yes.

1125
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:21,595
The thing is,
to show our lovers for you.

1126
01:08:22,025 --> 01:08:24,509
We messed with your break cable!

1127
01:08:24,747 --> 01:08:27,705
That's why you should listen to us
when we ask you to do something.

1128
01:08:27,747 --> 01:08:29,580
You loafers!

1129
01:08:44,204 --> 01:08:54,330
Look who is here, the future MLA of
Malleshwaram, Appanna of course!

1130
01:08:54,746 --> 01:08:57,788
Are you belittling me?
- Not at all.

1131
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,497
Listen!
- What?

1132
01:08:59,539 --> 01:09:02,079
You have turned a blind eye to your reality
for the sake of your unattainable dreams!

1133
01:09:02,121 --> 01:09:06,350
Have you lost it?
I mean who quits a job that offers

1134
01:09:06,787 --> 01:09:09,728
security and a decent salary
to enter politics!

1135
01:09:09,987 --> 01:09:12,149
Which idiot pushed you into
taking this irrational decision?

1136
01:09:13,246 --> 01:09:14,704
That Sreenivas Murthy
had called me earlier

1137
01:09:14,742 --> 01:09:16,412
What did he say?
- What else will he say?

1138
01:09:16,496 --> 01:09:18,163
He wanted the wedding
to be pushed to next year!

1139
01:09:18,205 --> 01:09:20,205
That's for the best!
- What?

1140
01:09:20,499 --> 01:09:23,038
So that means...

1141
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,543
Okay! So the fact that my wedding has
been pushed is bothering you

1142
01:09:25,655 --> 01:09:26,396
No.

1143
01:09:26,594 --> 01:09:28,069
Yes, but not the fact
that I have quit my job!

1144
01:09:28,114 --> 01:09:29,059
Exactly!

1145
01:09:29,997 --> 01:09:30,613
Grrrr..

1146
01:09:30,697 --> 01:09:32,288
Look at my bad luck!

1147
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:37,402
Till now not a single
arranged marriage in my family

1148
01:09:37,447 --> 01:09:39,147
had been cancelled
but now thanks to you.

1149
01:09:39,179 --> 01:09:40,944
As if yours is a very prestigious family!
- What did you say?

1150
01:09:41,459 --> 01:09:43,389
I said, my God what a
well respected family ours is!

1151
01:09:43,547 --> 01:09:44,249
Hey!

1152
01:09:44,412 --> 01:09:46,578
I want to ask you a question.
- What?

1153
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:48,410
This idea of a political career came
out of the blue. What prompted you?

1154
01:09:48,451 --> 01:09:50,241
I hope you are not planning
some sort of financial scam!

1155
01:09:50,283 --> 01:09:52,076
Why will anyone aspire
to become a politician?

1156
01:09:52,364 --> 01:09:53,756
To do social service of course!

1157
01:09:53,788 --> 01:09:54,368
Of course.

1158
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:55,441
He is my son.

1159
01:09:55,481 --> 01:09:58,133
Wait and watch how he will earn
more respect that you did.

1160
01:09:58,165 --> 01:09:59,617
I am watching already!

1161
01:09:59,701 --> 01:10:02,205
Your friends from the old age home
are here to see you.

1162
01:10:02,289 --> 01:10:04,328
They are talking to Ranveer
on the terrace.

1163
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:11,052
Son, why have you gathered
people aged 65-70 on the terrance?

1164
01:10:11,127 --> 01:10:13,378
Hello, they are my friends.
- Friends? - Yes.

1165
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:14,363
They?
- Yes.

1166
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:16,258
I spoke to one person.

1167
01:10:16,613 --> 01:10:18,491
He was your grandfather's
physics teacher.

1168
01:10:18,874 --> 01:10:20,584
So his physique has become weak.

1169
01:10:21,126 --> 01:10:23,596
Why do you want such friends?

1170
01:10:23,638 --> 01:10:25,444
Hello,
please don't insult my friends.

1171
01:10:25,518 --> 01:10:27,842
Mom, talk some sense to him.
- Okay, you go.

1172
01:10:28,622 --> 01:10:30,080
Hi, hi, hi..

1173
01:10:31,286 --> 01:10:34,538
Is the sweet tasty?
- Yes.

1174
01:10:34,621 --> 01:10:37,872
All this while you were blabbering,
now that he is here, ask him only.

1175
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:42,953
Our girl likes you. You also like her
- Correct.

1176
01:10:42,995 --> 01:10:43,830
That's what matters.

1177
01:10:43,956 --> 01:10:46,913
So, what I am saying is
who cares what her father thinks?!

1178
01:10:46,955 --> 01:10:50,372
Also he is not her only father!
- What?

1179
01:10:50,624 --> 01:10:52,122
We all are her fathers too!

1180
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:54,120
Hello, you don't have
to agree on everything!

1181
01:10:54,162 --> 01:10:56,390
Listen darling, we need to respect
blood ties at the end of the day.

1182
01:10:56,492 --> 01:10:58,659
I didn't mean it in the wrong way.
- Then?

1183
01:10:58,943 --> 01:11:01,679
I was trying to say that we all
think of her as our daughter.

1184
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:04,114
You should have
worded it right then!

1185
01:11:04,314 --> 01:11:07,135
Appu! - Yes, uncle?
- Don't you worry! - Okay, uncle.

1186
01:11:07,209 --> 01:11:09,725
We will make sure
you win the elections

1187
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:11,662
with top results.
- Thank you, uncle.

1188
01:11:11,862 --> 01:11:15,598
Right on top? - Yes.
- That too because of you guys? - Yes.

1189
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:16,505
Darling, drop that walking
stick on the ground.

1190
01:11:16,536 --> 01:11:18,413
Why?
- First do as I say, I'll explain.

1191
01:11:19,265 --> 01:11:20,217
Great!

1192
01:11:20,579 --> 01:11:22,955
Now try picking it from the ground
with the same vigor, let's see! Ha?

1193
01:11:23,123 --> 01:11:26,487
You are challenging me to pick
this up? This stick, that's it!

1194
01:11:27,774 --> 01:11:28,782
Ya, so do the needful.

1195
01:11:34,787 --> 01:11:38,830
You can do it uncle. Come on.
- You can do it. Be careful.

1196
01:11:38,872 --> 01:11:40,367
Sir, you can do it.

1197
01:11:42,454 --> 01:11:44,747
Watch it.
Sit him down carefully.

1198
01:11:46,602 --> 01:11:47,542
Sit down.

1199
01:11:47,705 --> 01:11:49,288
You can't even lift a stick up.

1200
01:11:49,734 --> 01:11:52,538
But here you are claiming that
you'll help him win an election.

1201
01:11:52,992 --> 01:11:56,372
Listen to me. Don't depend on them
to win, you'll fall flat.

1202
01:11:56,414 --> 01:11:57,247
Hey, Ranchod Singh!

1203
01:11:57,289 --> 01:11:59,454
It's Ranveer Singh! I'll hit you
if you don't get my name right!

1204
01:11:59,496 --> 01:12:00,288
Whatever!

1205
01:12:00,996 --> 01:12:05,076
We are not old,
we are experienced.

1206
01:12:05,307 --> 01:12:06,970
Yes!
- Oh!

1207
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:09,867
Appu, you do know that
experience is not something

1208
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,175
that can be bought even
if you want to right?

1209
01:12:12,534 --> 01:12:14,919
If you believe in our experience..

1210
01:12:18,068 --> 01:12:19,431
Trust us and we will
win this together.

1211
01:12:34,707 --> 01:12:36,747
What is it that a political leader
should know first and foremost?

1212
01:12:36,789 --> 01:12:37,455
What?

1213
01:12:37,581 --> 01:12:41,038
He/she should know why
they want to lead.

1214
01:12:41,206 --> 01:12:45,955
If you want to win with a majority,
you should become popular in this area.

1215
01:12:46,081 --> 01:12:49,833
Well, by winning the hearts of
women and they like two things.

1216
01:12:49,856 --> 01:12:50,593
What are those?

1217
01:12:50,625 --> 01:12:52,997
Saris and serials!

1218
01:12:53,123 --> 01:12:56,080
Dude, this serial gets
the highest TRPs. - Is it?

1219
01:13:03,991 --> 01:13:07,622
Not only women support required,
we need youth power.

1220
01:13:07,832 --> 01:13:11,663
For youth we have organized
a cricket tournament.

1221
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:14,255
While 20 percent of the votes
come from women. - Correct.

1222
01:13:14,317 --> 01:13:16,549
Another 20 percent will be
that of youngsters. - Yes.

1223
01:13:16,581 --> 01:13:19,331
However, drunkards will constitute
50 percent of your vote bank!

1224
01:13:19,415 --> 01:13:21,957
You wanted me to develop an app
that benefits alcoholics, right?

1225
01:13:22,176 --> 01:13:24,997
Here it is, the name of the app
is a winner in itself.

1226
01:13:27,411 --> 01:13:32,033
Students preparing for exams need
motivation more than preparations!

1227
01:13:32,111 --> 01:13:35,163
This app will provide information on
all the routes where police are waiting.

1228
01:13:35,289 --> 01:13:37,288
Anyone can update this info
on the app.

1229
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:41,787
You are the one who has acted
in that popular Kannada serial right?

1230
01:13:41,953 --> 01:13:42,949
Of course, that's me.

1231
01:13:42,996 --> 01:13:43,956
You want to take a picture with me?

1232
01:13:43,998 --> 01:13:45,953
People should think of you as a hero.

1233
01:13:46,037 --> 01:13:49,854
Sit down dad!

1234
01:13:50,164 --> 01:13:51,728
One more six!

1235
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:53,904
Sir, ever since your son has
started those motivational classes

1236
01:13:53,945 --> 01:13:54,934
we all have lost our peace of mind.

1237
01:13:55,134 --> 01:13:56,538
Why, what has he done now?

1238
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:57,949
Shankrappa, I'm waiting from 10 pm.

1239
01:13:58,348 --> 01:14:00,102
And we have not registered
a single drunk and drive case!

1240
01:14:00,455 --> 01:14:01,583
Has there been a decrease
in the number of drunkards?

1241
01:14:01,747 --> 01:14:04,445
No sir. I went and checked out
the parking lots of a couple of bars.

1242
01:14:04,745 --> 01:14:06,538
All of them are full.
- Is it?

1243
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,274
So I wonder why we can't spot
the same vehicles on the roads!

1244
01:14:08,328 --> 01:14:09,834
I don't need a photo with you.

1245
01:14:10,518 --> 01:14:13,491
In that serial,
you are saying that you will

1246
01:14:13,547 --> 01:14:15,882
take that innocent girl
to Sri Lanka with you!

1247
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:19,086
That apart I own a 3 BHK house
in Sadashivnagar. - Okay.

1248
01:14:19,238 --> 01:14:21,476
And yet, my son goes and sleeps
on the footpaths in Majestic!

1249
01:14:21,508 --> 01:14:23,372
Why, all the rooms in your house,
are taken is it?

1250
01:14:23,414 --> 01:14:25,414
If asked he says, he wants to become like
actor Yash, who came up the hard way!

1251
01:14:25,995 --> 01:14:28,956
Stop this guy! Stop.
- Take the vehicle key first.

1252
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:31,485
Sir, thanks to low battery,
my phone switched off!

1253
01:14:31,516 --> 01:14:34,302
Or else I would have
never taken this route!

1254
01:14:34,376 --> 01:14:36,827
My brother passed out of SSLC
with a distinction

1255
01:14:37,255 --> 01:14:39,051
but he refused to attend
his PUC board exams.

1256
01:14:39,454 --> 01:14:41,280
When I asked him,
he said Mark Zuckerberg

1257
01:14:41,342 --> 01:14:42,440
also dropped out of college.

1258
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,455
So like him I'll also discontinue studies
and start something like Facebook!

1259
01:14:44,623 --> 01:14:46,000
Tell me what's going on? If you
are honest with me, I'll let you go

1260
01:14:46,072 --> 01:14:48,892
Sir, there is an app on my phone
- Ha..

1261
01:14:48,939 --> 01:14:51,448
It's called Theertha Yatra.

1262
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,747
Vote it seems, vote!

1263
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:58,498
You think he will go easy on us if I
tell him that you are an MLA candidate?

1264
01:14:58,530 --> 01:15:01,455
Just not mine, I'll make sure no one
else in this area also votes for you!

1265
01:15:02,031 --> 01:15:04,370
I will ensure that not a single person
from police department votes for you!

1266
01:15:04,412 --> 01:15:06,176
The reason to lose
this match was Appanna

1267
01:15:06,392 --> 01:15:10,039
hence he might not
get votes from youth.

1268
01:15:13,748 --> 01:15:17,080
Usually people come to a stadium
to watch their favourite team win.

1269
01:15:17,206 --> 01:15:20,830
But I'm here to
celebrate your defeat!

1270
01:15:20,914 --> 01:15:22,678
Dad, let's go.
- You keep quiet.

1271
01:15:23,179 --> 01:15:26,538
You know, the idea of a cat
feeling and looking like a lion

1272
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:30,255
when it stares at its reflection in the
mirror works well only as facebook memes!

1273
01:15:31,258 --> 01:15:32,532
Symbolically speaking..

1274
01:15:33,691 --> 01:15:36,228
If my daughter is the IPL trophy

1275
01:15:37,107 --> 01:15:40,633
you are R C B!

1276
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:48,122
Darling, you console him and come.
I'll wait for you in the car.

1277
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:51,945
Life? Okay

1278
01:15:52,349 --> 01:15:55,735
Did I or my father told
to take up this challenge

1279
01:15:55,806 --> 01:15:58,232
and that he'd get us married
only if you win the election?

1280
01:15:58,937 --> 01:16:02,126
You brought this upon yourself.
What can I do?

1281
01:16:02,329 --> 01:16:05,796
His family has been involved in
politics for over 25 years now.

1282
01:16:05,843 --> 01:16:07,367
And you?
You have no experience whatsoever!

1283
01:16:10,163 --> 01:16:12,247
The thing about this society is that,
the moment someone attempts

1284
01:16:12,289 --> 01:16:14,627
to attempt something new
it burdens them with comparisons!

1285
01:16:15,567 --> 01:16:17,518
Let's say someone is thinking
of floating a start up

1286
01:16:17,552 --> 01:16:19,071
they say not everyone
can be a Steve Jobs!

1287
01:16:19,271 --> 01:16:21,330
If you say you want to open a petrol bunk
they ask if we think we are Ambanis.

1288
01:16:21,372 --> 01:16:23,077
If we want to start
a transport business

1289
01:16:23,103 --> 01:16:24,370
they say not everyone
can be where VRL is!

1290
01:16:24,416 --> 01:16:26,455
We are used to hearing
this from our childhood.

1291
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:29,251
I guess this is why
a lot of Shankar Nags

1292
01:16:29,379 --> 01:16:31,398
do not go beyond sitting
outside the theatres.

1293
01:16:31,627 --> 01:16:33,997
And many Rajinikanths
remain bus conductors!

1294
01:16:35,078 --> 01:16:38,246
I don't know why I
am entering politics.

1295
01:16:38,316 --> 01:16:41,630
It could be for me, you,
our love or society at large.

1296
01:16:43,122 --> 01:16:48,955
But I have decided to go ahead so
there is no going back no matter what

1297
01:16:50,869 --> 01:16:54,900
But do you think you can handle the way
in which this society will treat you

1298
01:16:54,974 --> 01:16:56,531
in case you lose this election?

1299
01:16:56,829 --> 01:17:01,690
You can't really sit and ponder
too much over what people will think.

1300
01:17:02,370 --> 01:17:03,902
I would rather focus on how
to work towards my goal.

1301
01:17:04,018 --> 01:17:06,019
Also that's way better than making fun
of others like what your father is doing!

1302
01:17:06,161 --> 01:17:07,604
This is getting personal!

1303
01:17:07,678 --> 01:17:10,518
I'm getting personal? Okay, the
other day in the cafe your father

1304
01:17:11,452 --> 01:17:15,705
asked me to be 10%, no 100%
better that the other guy.

1305
01:17:15,915 --> 01:17:20,330
You also walked away saying it was up
to me to figure out a way to impress him.

1306
01:17:21,373 --> 01:17:24,330
Once we decide we want something,
we go after it come what may.

1307
01:17:24,708 --> 01:17:26,980
Go advice and console your father.

1308
01:17:30,949 --> 01:17:35,084
All this happened because of you only.
Your ideas screwed everything up

1309
01:17:35,116 --> 01:17:37,455
Hello! I was not the one
who gave that serial idea?

1310
01:17:37,497 --> 01:17:38,592
His serial idea
hardly did any damage.

1311
01:17:38,637 --> 01:17:41,252
Everything went for a toss
becuase of his cricket idea!

1312
01:17:41,284 --> 01:17:45,330
You son...
Because of your idea we failed!

1313
01:17:45,372 --> 01:17:48,004
What did you just say?
Did you just abuse me and my son!

1314
01:17:48,207 --> 01:17:52,372
You know what, right back
at you and your son!

1315
01:17:52,414 --> 01:17:55,622
Listen up, sisters, why are you both
cussing at each other like this?

1316
01:17:55,664 --> 01:17:57,122
Like you don't know?
Tell him.

1317
01:17:57,164 --> 01:18:01,038
When you young people fight, you
curse at each others' parents right?

1318
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,912
Likewise we cuss at
each others' children!

1319
01:18:02,954 --> 01:18:05,870
Correct! Thank you for your
kind response. Please sit.

1320
01:18:05,912 --> 01:18:07,007
I don't know about you guys

1321
01:18:07,045 --> 01:18:08,645
but despite all this chaos,
I am very happy today.

1322
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:09,872
Why?

1323
01:18:09,914 --> 01:18:13,372
Finally someone followed me back
on Twitter. - Like really!?

1324
01:18:13,666 --> 01:18:16,320
Look at him contemplating
his next move all alone.

1325
01:18:16,362 --> 01:18:21,686
It's time for you guys to stop
the blame game and find a solution

1326
01:18:21,886 --> 01:18:25,290
Sir, we have fixed the water filter
Who do I give the bill to?

1327
01:18:25,365 --> 01:18:27,220
Give it to him.
- Sir, bill

1328
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:31,163
What's it man? - They are not willing
to buy the water filter, Boss.

1329
01:18:31,247 --> 01:18:33,889
Tell them you'll give them a
free one month product demo.

1330
01:18:34,138 --> 01:18:35,051
Then they'll accept.

1331
01:18:35,251 --> 01:18:38,498
But won't you incur a loss if you
offer free services for a month?

1332
01:18:38,834 --> 01:18:42,998
Sir, we are a new company, so I'm
doing this to market my product.

1333
01:18:45,038 --> 01:18:46,591
Please call me if you
want any more products

1334
01:18:46,615 --> 01:18:48,548
I'll provide you with
the best service.

1335
01:18:53,747 --> 01:18:56,371
Friends, we are a new
company too, right?

1336
01:18:57,102 --> 01:18:59,438
So why not offer free demo service
to gain people's trust then?

1337
01:18:59,582 --> 01:19:01,955
Demo?
- Yes.

1338
01:19:05,787 --> 01:19:06,656
Hello everybody,
welcome to today's press meet.

1339
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,122
I'm here today to announce that

1340
01:19:09,601 --> 01:19:11,961
for the first time in the
history of Indian politics

1341
01:19:12,161 --> 01:19:16,497
I will be trying out the demo
MLA concent in my constituency.

1342
01:19:16,539 --> 01:19:17,913
And what do you mean
by Demo MLA, sir?

1343
01:19:17,955 --> 01:19:22,090
Now when you go to a car show room,
you ask for a test drive

1344
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:23,872
and only if you like the driving
experience will you buy it.

1345
01:19:23,998 --> 01:19:27,746
Same goes with phones. You check for
all its features before buying it.

1346
01:19:27,788 --> 01:19:31,088
Likewise, before I become an MLA

1347
01:19:31,581 --> 01:19:34,574
I would want to put my working style
out there for people to see.

1348
01:19:35,023 --> 01:19:36,949
I want people to vote in my favour only
if they are convinced of my commitment.

1349
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:41,404
Moreover for the first time we
will be opening a 24/7 helpline.

1350
01:19:41,739 --> 01:19:44,735
People can use it to register
their complaints.

1351
01:19:46,828 --> 01:19:51,079
That's my scooter, sir.
Please help me find it.

1352
01:19:51,256 --> 01:19:53,362
If you succeed, I'll ensure that
my entire family votes for you.

1353
01:19:53,394 --> 01:19:57,570
Rai was very close to my father,
he passed away recently.

1354
01:19:58,134 --> 01:19:59,649
Otherwise we could have
seeked help from him.

1355
01:19:59,992 --> 01:20:01,038
No, he was Pai.

1356
01:20:01,122 --> 01:20:04,079
It's been five years since they
have put tar on our road, sir.

1357
01:20:04,121 --> 01:20:07,788
My son broke his arm from a cycle fall
because of these uneven roads.

1358
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:10,372
We dont have enough money with us.
How can we tar every road?

1359
01:20:11,245 --> 01:20:15,038
Uncle, my friends make fun of me
because my dad takes bribe.

1360
01:20:15,164 --> 01:20:17,206
It will be beneficial for them,
let him take.

1361
01:20:17,290 --> 01:20:20,538
Can't you all give some ideas!

1362
01:20:30,643 --> 01:20:32,484
You seem to be struggling a lot.

1363
01:20:32,931 --> 01:20:34,667
I've brought my contacts.

1364
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:37,575
Contacts?
- My fellows.

1365
01:20:38,050 --> 01:20:42,188
They love me from school.
I maintain a bunch of guys.

1366
01:20:42,497 --> 01:20:46,280
During Ganesh festival, the norm is to
collect funds to keep an idol and celebrate.

1367
01:20:46,339 --> 01:20:47,854
Yes.
- But for a change..

1368
01:20:48,083 --> 01:20:50,247
Dad, sign my marks card please.

1369
01:20:55,123 --> 01:20:58,946
This time we will go door-to-door
and collect funds as usual

1370
01:20:59,146 --> 01:21:01,670
but will use the proceeds
to repair the roads.

1371
01:21:01,870 --> 01:21:03,665
People urinate on our road,
it's become like a public toilet!

1372
01:21:03,737 --> 01:21:06,007
Please give a solution for that, sir.

1373
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:08,640
We will do as you say.

1374
01:21:09,459 --> 01:21:13,215
If it's going to benefit the nation and
society even in the smallest of ways

1375
01:21:13,247 --> 01:21:15,788
We will join hands and
work on it right away.

1376
01:21:15,956 --> 01:21:18,622
No matter how hard I try, I am
unable to land myself a job, guruji.

1377
01:21:18,748 --> 01:21:25,206
Your problems are not getting solved
because you urinate and spit in public.

1378
01:21:25,332 --> 01:21:27,005
We don't have a Math teacher
at our governement school.

1379
01:21:27,294 --> 01:21:29,286
How can we do something that
government is supposed to do?

1380
01:21:29,505 --> 01:21:30,673
Please help us, brother.

1381
01:21:30,789 --> 01:21:33,377
I have created an app called
Book My Class.

1382
01:21:33,527 --> 01:21:37,077
Through this app, anyone can
teach anything from anywhere.

1383
01:21:37,287 --> 01:21:39,830
(Teaching Maths through
online education app)

1384
01:21:40,166 --> 01:21:41,539
This is a sacred place.

1385
01:21:41,726 --> 01:21:44,244
It is beleived that Lord Ram
once passed through this place.

1386
01:21:51,205 --> 01:21:55,910
No more bribes I'll take here on,
my child.

1387
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:03,330
Excuse me, Are you in love with her?
- Bro, it's not what it looks like.

1388
01:22:03,705 --> 01:22:05,344
We are not a lovey dovey couple
like Shivarajkumar and Bhavana.

1389
01:22:05,376 --> 01:22:06,332
All that's in the past.

1390
01:22:06,555 --> 01:22:08,622
Now our relationship is pure and platonic
like that of Shivarajkumar and Radhika's.

1391
01:22:10,747 --> 01:22:13,407
I don't care if she is
Bhavana or Radhika.

1392
01:22:13,433 --> 01:22:15,150
But how dare you compare yourself
to our beloved Shivanna?

1393
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:16,233
Let's go.

1394
01:22:17,124 --> 01:22:19,212
Whether people do this for themselves
or in name of God

1395
01:22:19,331 --> 01:22:21,021
if this helps our country,
that's enough.

1396
01:22:21,221 --> 01:22:29,307
Sir, not only mine, entire my family,
friends vote to you.

1397
01:22:29,507 --> 01:22:32,493
You can become a good leader
in the future!

1398
01:22:33,238 --> 01:22:37,025
Demo MLA who has created history.

1399
01:22:37,531 --> 01:22:40,017
Who will people support?

1400
01:22:40,452 --> 01:22:42,264
Independent candidate Appanna?

1401
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:45,216
Or ex-minister's son
Shashank Radhakrisha?

1402
01:22:45,686 --> 01:22:47,751
Watch election fever.

1403
01:22:48,021 --> 01:22:49,741
Tonight at 8.

1404
01:22:52,748 --> 01:22:55,201
His dad is strict.

1405
01:22:55,285 --> 01:22:58,534
He doesn't like love
and love marriage.

1406
01:22:58,576 --> 01:23:02,286
I forgot to ask,
do you know cooking?

1407
01:23:02,370 --> 01:23:06,784
Anu! - No we are traditional
family, that's why I asked.

1408
01:23:06,816 --> 01:23:09,744
Monkey! Leave her,
do you know cooking?

1409
01:23:09,786 --> 01:23:11,075
I know.

1410
01:23:11,117 --> 01:23:13,133
In the Kesaribath that you are eating

1411
01:23:13,269 --> 01:23:15,003
how many spoons of maida
should you add?

1412
01:23:15,075 --> 01:23:17,288
Three.
- Three?

1413
01:23:17,372 --> 01:23:22,332
In Kesaribath, they don't add maida
they add rice, am I, right?

1414
01:23:26,705 --> 01:23:28,162
Your son has reached
marriage age.

1415
01:23:28,598 --> 01:23:30,359
With great difficulty
I have made love to her.

1416
01:23:30,591 --> 01:23:34,107
At my current age, it is really
difficult to find a better looking girl.

1417
01:23:34,569 --> 01:23:38,357
Dont reject her please as
she doesnt know cooking.

1418
01:23:38,676 --> 01:23:39,524
Okay..

1419
01:23:40,289 --> 01:23:41,863
Where is uncle?

1420
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:43,313
Him?

1421
01:23:45,072 --> 01:23:49,651
Naani Naani...

1422
01:24:04,037 --> 01:24:05,288
Who are you?

1423
01:24:05,330 --> 01:24:07,248
Uncle, I am Anu's friend.

1424
01:24:07,458 --> 01:24:09,867
How come you came so early?

1425
01:24:09,951 --> 01:24:11,361
You keep quite.
Who are you?

1426
01:24:12,039 --> 01:24:13,243
Uncle, I am Anu's friend.

1427
01:24:13,285 --> 01:24:17,748
There will be grown-up boys,
what work you have here?

1428
01:24:17,874 --> 01:24:24,441
When I was going to college,
One guy was troubbling me

1429
01:24:24,674 --> 01:24:27,507
hence Anu asked me to come here

1430
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:31,327
Who was the one forcing you
to love him? Come, show me.

1431
01:24:31,369 --> 01:24:37,121
Hey, We have a son,
he will take care, you get relaxed.

1432
01:24:37,153 --> 01:24:39,589
Appu..
- Not Appu, Appanna.

1433
01:24:40,293 --> 01:24:42,555
Appanna..
- Yes, Dad.

1434
01:24:42,592 --> 01:24:43,854
Love her.
- What!

1435
01:24:43,934 --> 01:24:45,501
Love her.
- Okay.

1436
01:24:45,533 --> 01:24:51,894
Some boys are troubling her to
love her, please see who are those.

1437
01:24:51,968 --> 01:24:52,549
Okay, Dad.

1438
01:24:52,825 --> 01:24:56,413
Hey, come here, how will you go?

1439
01:24:56,455 --> 01:24:58,040
2 wheeler, Dad.

1440
01:24:58,586 --> 01:25:02,784
Don't want, there are loads of
humps in this area. Go in 4 wheeler.

1441
01:25:04,788 --> 01:25:06,537
What you said?

1442
01:25:06,579 --> 01:25:07,330
What did I say?

1443
01:25:07,372 --> 01:25:10,120
Your lips are closed, from where
the sound was coming.

1444
01:25:10,162 --> 01:25:12,784
Hey, take vehicle key,
go and come fast.

1445
01:25:12,826 --> 01:25:14,825
Dad, what's special today?

1446
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:19,493
Hey, today it's special day, come.

1447
01:25:19,535 --> 01:25:21,117
What's special day?

1448
01:25:21,159 --> 01:25:24,789
Today is the the day
I saw you and I fell.

1449
01:25:25,369 --> 01:25:27,277
What's so special?

1450
01:25:27,319 --> 01:25:31,621
How come you came early today?
- Why any problem?

1451
01:25:31,663 --> 01:25:33,163
No problem.

1452
01:25:33,205 --> 01:25:36,079
No problem, we are happy.
I got surprised.

1453
01:25:37,254 --> 01:25:39,246
Today is a special day.

1454
01:25:39,288 --> 01:25:41,574
What it is?

1455
01:25:43,083 --> 01:25:44,655
Today is Rakhshabandhana.

1456
01:25:44,697 --> 01:25:47,907
Rakhshabandhana. So nice.

1457
01:25:48,033 --> 01:25:53,836
On this auspicious day, sisters
tie the rakhi to all their brothers

1458
01:25:54,036 --> 01:25:57,973
and ask them to protect them
for entire their life.

1459
01:25:58,005 --> 01:25:59,951
Wow! - Wait..
- Tie it.

1460
01:26:00,073 --> 01:26:02,743
Wait, always you tie,
today let her tie.

1461
01:26:02,766 --> 01:26:04,761
What!
Why should she tie?

1462
01:26:04,835 --> 01:26:06,854
Wait, every year she ties it to me.

1463
01:26:07,143 --> 01:26:09,173
She has already tied today to her bother
Why should she tie it to me now?

1464
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:09,882
Shut up.

1465
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:13,082
Yes, we need change
- You want protection, right?

1466
01:26:14,186 --> 01:26:18,392
You might get a terrible husband.
He will be you good brother.

1467
01:26:18,574 --> 01:26:19,672
Understood?
Tie this.

1468
01:26:20,542 --> 01:26:21,542
Go on, tie it.

1469
01:26:21,574 --> 01:26:23,412
Jeez, I'll prepare the stand.

1470
01:26:23,570 --> 01:26:24,628
You keep quiet.

1471
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:26,248
Do whatever you want.
- You tie.

1472
01:26:39,544 --> 01:26:41,284
Wait, one second.

1473
01:26:41,326 --> 01:26:45,201
Let me put a song
according to the situation.

1474
01:26:54,717 --> 01:26:58,487
Aruna, even if we try again

1475
01:26:58,567 --> 01:27:00,982
we can't give birth
to such kids.

1476
01:27:01,918 --> 01:27:05,523
Why are you staring at me?
Look at the cute sister you've got.

1477
01:27:06,675 --> 01:27:07,707
Go on, tie it.

1478
01:27:10,693 --> 01:27:12,628
What happened? - The power went off.
- Power went off?

1479
01:27:12,702 --> 01:27:17,121
This mischievous guy is sitting next
to that cute girl. And the power has gone.

1480
01:27:17,247 --> 01:27:19,134
Hey, Aruna.
What happened?

1481
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:20,754
Check the power.

1482
01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:33,471
Did she tie it?

1483
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:38,751
I'm satisfied now. Take her now.
- Okay.

1484
01:27:39,551 --> 01:27:42,954
Hey, you're taking her
in a car, right?

1485
01:27:43,143 --> 01:27:44,294
Yes, that's what you told me.

1486
01:27:44,326 --> 01:27:45,952
Let her sit at the back.

1487
01:27:46,026 --> 01:27:48,130
Why? - Where would she sit
on a motorbike?

1488
01:27:48,162 --> 01:27:50,708
On the back?
- Follow the same now.

1489
01:27:51,258 --> 01:27:53,061
Oh, logic?

1490
01:27:53,139 --> 01:27:56,038
Remember, if you are loafer..

1491
01:28:04,123 --> 01:28:07,623
Sir, there is no one in
the opponent who is strong.

1492
01:28:07,662 --> 01:28:13,707
However our independent Appanna
is most popular on social media.

1493
01:28:13,829 --> 01:28:14,679
How can you say that?

1494
01:28:14,748 --> 01:28:20,748
Sir, to become popular polititian,
these 4 points are very important.

1495
01:28:20,953 --> 01:28:23,453
1. Public Image

1496
01:28:23,495 --> 01:28:26,039
2. Public Behaviour

1497
01:28:26,081 --> 01:28:29,081
3. Connection with the voters

1498
01:28:29,123 --> 01:28:32,039
4. Background of the candidate

1499
01:28:32,081 --> 01:28:35,427
Now apply these points
to Appanna's behavious.

1500
01:28:35,690 --> 01:28:40,067
Because of Demo MLA concept,
he has gained popularity.

1501
01:28:40,307 --> 01:28:42,555
He has a good public image.

1502
01:28:42,704 --> 01:28:43,663
Excuse me, sir.

1503
01:28:44,629 --> 01:28:46,164
The four qualities
that you mentioned

1504
01:28:46,216 --> 01:28:48,066
are not at all important for
one to become a politician!

1505
01:28:48,163 --> 01:28:50,740
The most important trait
of a politician

1506
01:28:51,737 --> 01:28:52,983
5. Oratory skills!

1507
01:28:53,415 --> 01:28:54,600
Didn't get it?

1508
01:28:54,698 --> 01:28:57,761
Then tune into News First channel
at 9 pm. You'll understand.

1509
01:29:05,865 --> 01:29:10,583
Hello everybody, you are watching
'Demo Politics', a News First special.

1510
01:29:10,741 --> 01:29:12,067
And I'm your host
Sommana Machimada.

1511
01:29:12,162 --> 01:29:15,039
On tonight's show, I have with me
CM candidate, Shashank Radhakrishnan.

1512
01:29:15,081 --> 01:29:16,871
Welcome to the my show, sir.
Hello.

1513
01:29:16,913 --> 01:29:20,190
Sir, your opponent
Appanna is becoming viral

1514
01:29:20,259 --> 01:29:22,640
on social media due to
his Demo MLA concept.

1515
01:29:22,972 --> 01:29:23,997
Your thoughts on that?

1516
01:29:24,029 --> 01:29:26,784
Sir, Indian politics
needs a lot of drama.

1517
01:29:26,913 --> 01:29:31,014
Here gimmicks take
precedence over real issues

1518
01:29:31,088 --> 01:29:35,457
For instance, a certain someone reports
to the police about a stolen bike.

1519
01:29:35,499 --> 01:29:39,165
This person calls Appanna
also regarding the stolen bike.

1520
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:43,497
Team Appanna finds the bike
within an hour even.

1521
01:29:43,539 --> 01:29:45,987
Everybody is happy and
starts trending on Facebook and Twitter

1522
01:29:46,029 --> 01:29:49,035
But if you think a little logically about it

1523
01:29:49,255 --> 01:29:54,752
you will start to wonder how
an entire police force could not do in one week

1524
01:29:54,831 --> 01:29:57,580
was accomplished by these people
in just a matter of an hour?

1525
01:29:57,622 --> 01:30:01,946
Does this mean, they in someway know these theives
or are they the theives themselves?!

1526
01:30:03,196 --> 01:30:03,916
I really don't get this.

1527
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,082
Fair point!
Let's assume you're right But

1528
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:09,082
What about collecting funds for road
repairs instead of sepnding it on religious festivities.

1529
01:30:09,376 --> 01:30:10,872
That needs to be appreciated, right?

1530
01:30:10,914 --> 01:30:13,881
See, let's say you need
a minimum of 30-35 lakh rupees

1531
01:30:13,996 --> 01:30:17,463
to construct a one km stretch of road.

1532
01:30:18,001 --> 01:30:22,003
And they collected 10 lakh rupees each
from 8 wards for this purpose.

1533
01:30:22,038 --> 01:30:24,328
Total funds will amount to 80 lakh rupees.

1534
01:30:24,621 --> 01:30:27,369
I'm now curious to find out
where the remaining 45 lakhs went?

1535
01:30:27,411 --> 01:30:29,151
But this is not the shocker!

1536
01:30:29,475 --> 01:30:33,238
The minimum thickness of
any road should be 225 mm.

1537
01:30:33,407 --> 01:30:37,085
I found out that the thickness
was 150 mm only.

1538
01:30:37,125 --> 01:30:38,615
This only means that it hasn't

1539
01:30:38,651 --> 01:30:40,803
even costed them 35 lakh rupees
to build those roads!

1540
01:30:41,162 --> 01:30:44,288
I have seen people turn scamsters
after coming to power.

1541
01:30:44,372 --> 01:30:46,064
But this is the first time
that someone managed

1542
01:30:46,239 --> 01:30:48,974
to scam people even
before coming to power!

1543
01:30:49,225 --> 01:30:51,687
I just applaud his brilliance!

1544
01:30:52,097 --> 01:30:56,068
So, this is what ministerial candidate,
Shashank Radhakrishna

1545
01:30:56,119 --> 01:30:59,422
had to say about his opponent,
Appanna's Demo MLA concept.

1546
01:30:59,684 --> 01:31:02,186
As for the result of the election,
looks like we will

1547
01:31:02,230 --> 01:31:04,489
have to wait and watch whom
the public opinion will favour!

1548
01:31:04,521 --> 01:31:05,719
Thank you for watching News First

1549
01:31:05,944 --> 01:31:08,676
a channel that's committed
to keeping you updated.

1550
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:13,349
Accused of corruption even
before coming to power

1551
01:31:13,374 --> 01:31:15,836
Malleshwaram candidate Appanna.

1552
01:31:16,036 --> 01:31:21,287
In yesterday's incident, Appanna and
his team were arrested by the police.

1553
01:31:21,486 --> 01:31:24,587
Is demo MLA is a scam?

1554
01:31:24,794 --> 01:31:26,790
Watch tonight at 8.

1555
01:31:27,586 --> 01:31:28,093
Dear.

1556
01:31:30,163 --> 01:31:33,874
This is the first time that someone
from our family has been arrested.

1557
01:31:34,210 --> 01:31:38,457
What makes it worse is the fact
that he is a son of a teacher!

1558
01:31:38,583 --> 01:31:39,873
We will talk to him
once he comes home

1559
01:31:39,957 --> 01:31:44,073
All this is happening because
of your bad parenting.

1560
01:31:46,497 --> 01:31:50,790
Sir, is this Appu bro's house? - What?
- Appu bro? - Yes

1561
01:31:51,294 --> 01:31:53,334
Is he here?
- No, he's gone out.

1562
01:31:53,471 --> 01:31:54,784
Please give this to him
when he is back.

1563
01:31:54,942 --> 01:31:55,768
What is this?

1564
01:31:56,094 --> 01:32:00,967
My parents are cobblers. They have
a small shop near the bustand.

1565
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,740
They, however, want me to
become a succesful officer.

1566
01:32:03,772 --> 01:32:06,148
But I go to a government school

1567
01:32:06,192 --> 01:32:07,643
and we never had access
to a Math teacher.

1568
01:32:07,843 --> 01:32:11,373
But we were able to learn from one
thanks to Appu's Book My Class app.

1569
01:32:11,415 --> 01:32:13,231
I passed out with a distinction

1570
01:32:13,251 --> 01:32:16,438
and I am not the only student
who benefitted from this.

1571
01:32:16,667 --> 01:32:20,165
When I told all this to my father,
he wanted to thank Appu by giving this.

1572
01:32:32,917 --> 01:32:34,531
I'll take leave from you now, sir.

1573
01:32:40,123 --> 01:32:43,081
You know in all these years
that I have been a teacher.

1574
01:32:45,582 --> 01:32:47,453
Not a single student of mine has ever
gifted me anything like this!

1575
01:32:48,897 --> 01:32:50,573
Go get my bag for me.

1576
01:32:50,773 --> 01:32:54,915
Why? - I will go and get
that photo frame I broke fixed.

1577
01:33:23,794 --> 01:33:25,701
Appanna, Appanna, Appanna..

1578
01:33:26,331 --> 01:33:29,623
I was expecting to
meet you in the Assembly.

1579
01:33:30,028 --> 01:33:31,651
But fate always has
its own plans for us

1580
01:33:31,767 --> 01:33:34,241
and here I am meeting you,
in a jail!

1581
01:33:34,831 --> 01:33:37,384
I actually feel sorry for you.

1582
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:40,450
You are unable to get a
hold of politics on one hand

1583
01:33:40,705 --> 01:33:43,462
and are on the verge of losing
the love of your life on the other!

1584
01:33:43,622 --> 01:33:46,720
You really think these oldies will
help you swim against the tide?

1585
01:33:46,925 --> 01:33:48,210
You really think you can defeat me?

1586
01:33:48,786 --> 01:33:50,717
Let me tell you something.

1587
01:33:51,528 --> 01:33:53,860
Even though the race is between
a tortoise and a hare

1588
01:33:55,206 --> 01:33:58,542
it's the lion that is declared a winner
and that my friend is called politics!

1589
01:33:58,957 --> 01:34:01,657
Plus if you have to win
against a lion like me,

1590
01:34:01,878 --> 01:34:04,916
you got be akin to a tiger at least.

1591
01:34:05,429 --> 01:34:09,069
But for me, you are nothing more
than a mosquito

1592
01:34:10,292 --> 01:34:11,862
that I can kill in a second!

1593
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:15,373
Anyway I came here for a reason.

1594
01:34:19,492 --> 01:34:23,291
It's my birthday tomorrow
and I'm throwing a party.

1595
01:34:23,902 --> 01:34:27,625
As part of the celebrations,
I'll be announcing my wedding date.

1596
01:34:28,997 --> 01:34:30,361
You can't stop the wedding, of course.

1597
01:34:31,611 --> 01:34:34,753
What you all can however,
do is to shower your blessings on me

1598
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:36,778
from here only!

1599
01:34:37,539 --> 01:34:39,334
Last but not the least.

1600
01:34:40,856 --> 01:34:44,114
Just because you were popular
in college doesn't mean that

1601
01:34:44,379 --> 01:34:48,532
you will become a mass leader now!

1602
01:34:55,997 --> 01:34:59,998
They have done up
the place really well.

1603
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:05,831
Dad, you should have spoken to me
before saying okay to this.

1604
01:35:05,873 --> 01:35:09,160
They said they will just make an
announcement about your wedding

1605
01:35:09,203 --> 01:35:10,475
as part of the celebrations.

1606
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:12,513
It's not like there is going to be an
engagement ceremony or anything.

1607
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:15,448
Dad, you know I like Appu.

1608
01:35:15,682 --> 01:35:18,517
What will I tell him when he hears
about this and confronts me?

1609
01:35:18,549 --> 01:35:21,749
They have assured me that they won't make
it official until the elections are over.

1610
01:35:21,791 --> 01:35:23,363
This party is being thrown for their
close circle only, so don't worry.

1611
01:35:23,447 --> 01:35:26,427
I'm sure paneer butter masala and
carrot halwa are a part of the menu.

1612
01:35:26,476 --> 01:35:27,499
Let's go enjoy the food

1613
01:35:27,538 --> 01:35:30,443
Paneer, it seems!
You only go eat!

1614
01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:32,586
Hear me out!

1615
01:35:32,641 --> 01:35:37,373
Good evening. We are here
to celebrate my birthday.

1616
01:35:37,751 --> 01:35:44,015
But what's even more special about
this evening is the fact that candidates

1617
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:50,475
who are contesting against me
in the election also here today.

1618
01:35:51,651 --> 01:35:56,205
This shows that we are not rivals

1619
01:35:56,363 --> 01:35:59,702
but only opponents who are running
in the same race to win a cup.

1620
01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:05,369
Only one person is awarded
the first rank in an exam

1621
01:36:06,364 --> 01:36:09,381
But this does not mean the other
students who don't get the top marks

1622
01:36:09,965 --> 01:36:11,314
will detest him, right?

1623
01:36:11,484 --> 01:36:15,027
Likewise, there can be only one winner
in this election and whoever that is

1624
01:36:16,206 --> 01:36:17,096
Only one will win.

1625
01:36:17,926 --> 01:36:19,764
We will congratulate him
and support him.

1626
01:36:21,738 --> 01:36:27,362
Let's all come together and support
him in building a healthy society.

1627
01:36:32,041 --> 01:36:33,415
There is something else that
I want to share with you today.

1628
01:36:33,843 --> 01:36:37,113
I'll be getting married right
after the elections are over.

1629
01:36:37,523 --> 01:36:41,458
My engagement cards have
been place on your tables.

1630
01:36:43,206 --> 01:36:44,790
Please do take a look.

1631
01:36:59,748 --> 01:37:01,276
'Engagement ceremony
of APPANNA & ABHIGNYA'

1632
01:37:38,497 --> 01:37:40,311
Hi, there!
- Hi!

1633
01:37:41,266 --> 01:37:42,275
I'm sure you are
shocked to see us here.

1634
01:37:42,747 --> 01:37:45,708
The point was to shock you with our
presence at your own birthday party.

1635
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:47,582
Of course, it was your government
that sent us to jail.

1636
01:37:47,624 --> 01:37:50,649
Despite that we were released and
naturally you want to know how

1637
01:37:50,793 --> 01:37:52,005
so let's cut to the flashback.

1638
01:38:00,125 --> 01:38:01,668
What's a central minister doing here?

1639
01:38:01,828 --> 01:38:04,791
Good evening, madam.
- Who asked you to arrest them?

1640
01:38:05,043 --> 01:38:05,938
How dare you!

1641
01:38:05,994 --> 01:38:10,165
Release them immediately. Let them out.
- Quick! Do that right away

1642
01:38:11,042 --> 01:38:12,207
Thank you, so much, madam

1643
01:38:16,958 --> 01:38:21,951
Thanks, darling. - Happy?
Don't forget to call me later, okay?

1644
01:38:25,124 --> 01:38:29,499
Had I not told you, that someone
started following me on Twitter?

1645
01:38:29,709 --> 01:38:31,825
None of you bothered
to check who it was.

1646
01:38:31,877 --> 01:38:34,342
Anyway, she is the one
and she is my ex!

1647
01:38:37,122 --> 01:38:39,375
How was the twist? If your hold
is on the local government

1648
01:38:39,433 --> 01:38:41,617
our reach is up to the
central government!

1649
01:38:42,915 --> 01:38:44,996
Shashank, Shashank, Shashank..

1650
01:38:45,253 --> 01:38:47,933
Guys, was my base voice up to the mark?
- Make it a bit deeper please. - Okay.

1651
01:38:48,206 --> 01:38:50,005
You are in such a sorry state

1652
01:38:50,146 --> 01:38:52,306
Better now?
- Ya, maintain this pitch.

1653
01:38:52,872 --> 01:38:54,953
You are in a spot where you
can neither express your frustration

1654
01:38:54,995 --> 01:38:56,648
nor can you win the girl over.

1655
01:38:56,797 --> 01:38:58,782
You may be the most powerful person.

1656
01:38:58,814 --> 01:39:00,146
But that does not mean, you
can control what's going to happen next!

1657
01:39:00,938 --> 01:39:04,447
The playing field may be different,
but even you know

1658
01:39:05,072 --> 01:39:06,669
I'm good at this game and it's only
a matter of time before I master it!

1659
01:39:07,915 --> 01:39:10,255
And yes, you may be the lion
and I may look like a mosquito

1660
01:39:10,279 --> 01:39:11,548
from where you stand.

1661
01:39:12,915 --> 01:39:16,147
But remember this,
a lion can't irritate a mosquito

1662
01:39:16,190 --> 01:39:18,243
as much as a mosquito
can irritate a lion!

1663
01:39:18,373 --> 01:39:20,204
I think I have spoken enough,
shall we leave?

1664
01:39:20,325 --> 01:39:21,662
Just one more dialogue please.

1665
01:39:22,122 --> 01:39:24,453
Last but not the least.. I may be good
enough to become a class leader only.

1666
01:39:24,537 --> 01:39:25,970
I don't intend to be
a mass leader either.

1667
01:39:26,137 --> 01:39:33,398
For mass is temporary but class.
That's permanent!

1668
01:39:35,465 --> 01:39:36,308
Bye now!

1669
01:39:40,706 --> 01:39:43,501
So how was my entry? - Super.
- Thanks a lot!

1670
01:39:44,997 --> 01:39:48,774
Father-in-law dearest, was
that impressive enough for you?

1671
01:39:49,038 --> 01:39:52,252
The race has already started

1672
01:39:52,650 --> 01:39:55,958
and you are still standing here
and seeking my approval!

1673
01:39:57,084 --> 01:40:01,748
Tell me something, are you really
confident of winning this election?

1674
01:40:03,582 --> 01:40:10,745
Father-in-law, what matters is
not who starts the race first

1675
01:40:11,081 --> 01:40:15,973
but who touches the end line first!

1676
01:40:16,173 --> 01:40:16,790
I right, my love?

1677
01:40:18,289 --> 01:40:19,920
Bye, Father-in-law
- Bye.

1678
01:40:27,206 --> 01:40:30,873
Okay guys, let's change our strategy
from today onwards.

1679
01:40:31,267 --> 01:40:33,973
What is the first thing that comes
to your mind when I say China?

1680
01:40:33,995 --> 01:40:35,799
Of course, it's population.

1681
01:40:35,984 --> 01:40:38,723
They are ahead of us
in terms of population.

1682
01:40:39,365 --> 01:40:43,077
They are way ahead of us
when it comes to technology.

1683
01:40:43,194 --> 01:40:43,600
Correct.

1684
01:40:43,782 --> 01:40:48,528
Forget the technology, they were
the ones who brought Corona!

1685
01:40:48,866 --> 01:40:49,344
Correct.

1686
01:40:49,744 --> 01:40:51,708
And this is the answer
I've been waiting for.

1687
01:40:51,909 --> 01:40:58,579
A person's good deeds lasts
only until he does something bad.

1688
01:40:58,621 --> 01:41:05,956
But looks like the best thing to do
now is to think how to make him lose!

1689
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:08,081
Is that even a possibility?

1690
01:41:08,417 --> 01:41:11,081
There are four ways
to make a person lose.

1691
01:41:11,540 --> 01:41:14,842
1. Public image

1692
01:41:15,581 --> 01:41:18,589
We should damage his public image.

1693
01:41:18,915 --> 01:41:21,336
2. Public behaviour.

1694
01:41:22,070 --> 01:41:25,290
We should do something that people
will land up questioning his character.

1695
01:41:25,497 --> 01:41:28,613
3. Public interaction

1696
01:41:29,352 --> 01:41:33,169
Meaning the connection
with the public.. - Not mine..

1697
01:41:33,531 --> 01:41:34,706
Should be cut.

1698
01:41:34,864 --> 01:41:38,074
4. Background of the candidate.

1699
01:41:38,116 --> 01:41:41,747
Where ever public sees him,
they should hit him.

1700
01:41:41,831 --> 01:41:45,626
We have to completely destroy
his name and connections, understood?

1701
01:41:45,826 --> 01:41:48,408
Okay, I'll explain.

1702
01:41:48,987 --> 01:41:51,289
We have to break the bowler's hand

1703
01:41:51,548 --> 01:41:54,914
because we cannot bat!
Now do you understand?

1704
01:41:57,252 --> 01:41:58,415
And this is how you should do it!

1705
01:41:58,457 --> 01:42:01,831
All this seems fine.
But I still feel something is missing

1706
01:42:01,873 --> 01:42:02,970
I know what it is.

1707
01:42:03,078 --> 01:42:06,642
A good title for our operation.
I'll come up with a good one.

1708
01:42:13,249 --> 01:42:16,995
Wait, Take a step back.
I will not accept this title.

1709
01:42:17,056 --> 01:42:18,246
Everyone has used this title.

1710
01:42:18,278 --> 01:42:21,708
You do not understand,
For taking revenge this is good title.

1711
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:23,331
Whatsoever, I will not agree

1712
01:42:23,837 --> 01:42:25,475
Is it... Shashank..

1713
01:42:25,507 --> 01:42:27,458
Hey, wait!
Shashank, it seems!

1714
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:31,594
Vishnu sir, with your permission,
please, sorry.

1715
01:42:33,457 --> 01:42:35,458
Start background music.

1716
01:42:41,958 --> 01:42:46,412
'Ex minister's son misbehaves
with an elderly lady.'

1717
01:42:46,454 --> 01:42:49,711
Why did you have to get
into a fight with someone

1718
01:42:49,764 --> 01:42:52,318
who is as old as your grandmother?

1719
01:42:52,350 --> 01:42:53,930
'A grandmother's story.'

1720
01:42:54,130 --> 01:42:55,329
Nonsense!

1721
01:42:56,289 --> 01:42:59,206
Mom, do you even know
what happened there?

1722
01:43:07,248 --> 01:43:07,831
Greetings.

1723
01:43:07,873 --> 01:43:10,415
I want to talk to you privately.

1724
01:43:10,457 --> 01:43:11,998
Why not?
Please come.

1725
01:43:12,430 --> 01:43:14,401
How can I help you?

1726
01:43:15,913 --> 01:43:18,528
Dear Shashank,
I am unable to eat from the time

1727
01:43:18,581 --> 01:43:20,093
I have set my eyes on you.

1728
01:43:20,167 --> 01:43:22,726
Intially I thought it's
because of gastric.

1729
01:43:22,795 --> 01:43:26,176
But later I figured it's love.

1730
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:27,079
What is this?

1731
01:43:27,121 --> 01:43:31,679
Love letter. I fell in love with you
at the very instance I saw you.

1732
01:43:31,837 --> 01:43:35,040
That's why I've written a love letter.
That too using my blood, just for you.

1733
01:43:35,082 --> 01:43:37,665
What nonsense is this?
Are you in your right mind?

1734
01:43:37,707 --> 01:43:39,831
Didn't you find anyone
else to play with?

1735
01:43:39,873 --> 01:43:44,613
In serials, you are okay
with an old man falling in love

1736
01:43:44,700 --> 01:43:46,172
with a young girl and marrying her!

1737
01:43:46,206 --> 01:43:50,364
But in real life when an older
woman likes a young boy

1738
01:43:50,557 --> 01:43:52,653
why is it not okay?

1739
01:43:52,727 --> 01:43:55,415
I don't want love or anything,
Take this.

1740
01:43:55,541 --> 01:43:58,162
Hey, please... - Leave me alone.
- Please understand me.

1741
01:43:58,204 --> 01:44:00,206
Please, I love you!

1742
01:44:00,458 --> 01:44:05,331
I pleaded with him to
help me with my pension.

1743
01:44:05,499 --> 01:44:09,265
I literally begged him but such
was his insensitivity to my problem

1744
01:44:09,339 --> 01:44:11,666
that he tore the letter
and walked away.

1745
01:44:12,456 --> 01:44:13,739
Make way.

1746
01:44:17,188 --> 01:44:18,190
What happened to my ears?

1747
01:44:21,282 --> 01:44:22,841
I can't hear a thing
- What?

1748
01:44:24,336 --> 01:44:26,712
I can't hear you!
- I can hear you.

1749
01:44:26,895 --> 01:44:30,076
You can hear me?
- Don't shout I can hear you.

1750
01:44:30,111 --> 01:44:32,831
Is it just me who can't hear?
Maybe I have become deaf

1751
01:44:33,362 --> 01:44:35,873
We are practicing for
our next operation.

1752
01:44:36,041 --> 01:44:39,249
Who's getting an operation done?
- Our next operation!

1753
01:44:39,375 --> 01:44:40,052
What?

1754
01:44:41,618 --> 01:44:44,326
Operation Shhhh.

1755
01:44:44,447 --> 01:44:45,507
Shhhh?!

1756
01:44:46,830 --> 01:44:47,538
Okay, Shhhh.

1757
01:44:58,068 --> 01:45:01,076
Excuse me.. - Yes, sir.
- ..can we start the programme?

1758
01:45:01,276 --> 01:45:03,242
We are expecting another guest, sir.

1759
01:45:03,282 --> 01:45:05,372
You'll have to wait for five
minutes, sir. If you don't mind..

1760
01:45:05,537 --> 01:45:06,433
Oh, okay.

1761
01:45:18,002 --> 01:45:22,627
Sir, if you don't mind,
can you stand up for the guest?

1762
01:45:22,919 --> 01:45:25,873
You expect me stand up
because of him? No way!

1763
01:45:36,085 --> 01:45:42,327
Shashank who misbehaved with an old lady
yesterday has gotten into trouble yet again.

1764
01:45:42,367 --> 01:45:47,376
We are breaking this
exclusive news at 8 pm.

1765
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:49,917
Shashank is big headed.

1766
01:45:50,700 --> 01:45:52,025
Why? What happened?

1767
01:45:52,162 --> 01:45:53,186
Watch this.

1768
01:45:56,251 --> 01:45:59,269
Was Shashank disrespecting the
national anthem by sitting down

1769
01:45:59,301 --> 01:46:03,136
while others stood up
to show their respect?

1770
01:46:03,197 --> 01:46:06,642
What kind of culture is this?
Come, let's ask.

1771
01:46:07,425 --> 01:46:11,638
'Shashank misbehaves with an old lady.'

1772
01:46:11,858 --> 01:46:15,140
'Shashank disrespects national anthem!
Breaking News'

1773
01:46:19,658 --> 01:46:23,586
Listen, Shashank, your dad is not
as good you think he is.

1774
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:26,889
Sorry.

1775
01:46:31,457 --> 01:46:36,140
I will take care of things
going further. Don't worry.

1776
01:46:47,870 --> 01:46:48,744
No.

1777
01:46:55,081 --> 01:46:57,036
This can't be happening...
This should not be happening.

1778
01:46:57,118 --> 01:46:58,369
What should not happen?

1779
01:46:58,409 --> 01:47:02,083
Radhakrishna is providing a fan, TV, fridge

1780
01:47:02,112 --> 01:47:04,425
and five thousand cash to
the homes of every voter.

1781
01:47:05,207 --> 01:47:07,040
Let us also give.
- Okay okay.

1782
01:47:07,250 --> 01:47:12,684
If we sell yours and mine and
everyone's eyes, kidneys and liver

1783
01:47:12,746 --> 01:47:16,941
we will be able to generate
over 25 lakh rupees tops!

1784
01:47:17,141 --> 01:47:19,082
And what do you think you can you provide
with that money other than peanuts?

1785
01:47:19,166 --> 01:47:21,543
I said let's give.
Let's not give too much. - Then?

1786
01:47:21,583 --> 01:47:24,122
Let's give 10 TVs,
10 cookers and 10 fans.

1787
01:47:24,164 --> 01:47:27,159
In that case we also will get
two, three, four or five votes only!

1788
01:47:27,201 --> 01:47:30,205
That brings us to our final operation.

1789
01:47:30,247 --> 01:47:31,206
What?

1790
01:47:37,170 --> 01:47:40,081
Operation Drone Pratap!

1791
01:47:40,876 --> 01:47:42,376
So this is product number one.

1792
01:47:42,496 --> 01:47:43,580
Do you know this?
- Of course..

1793
01:47:43,622 --> 01:47:45,914
This is a tape recorder You insert a
cassette and listen to devotional songs.

1794
01:47:46,376 --> 01:47:48,455
What else?
It's just a fan.

1795
01:47:48,497 --> 01:47:50,629
But this is a special fan.
- What's special?

1796
01:47:50,777 --> 01:47:53,704
At level one you can eliminate humidity.
- At level two it will eliminate the person?

1797
01:47:53,736 --> 01:47:54,456
Exactly!

1798
01:47:54,498 --> 01:47:56,248
Oh goodness! Is it so?
- Yes.

1799
01:47:56,290 --> 01:47:58,582
Product number 2.
Pressure cooker.

1800
01:47:58,918 --> 01:48:00,539
At three whistles,
you'll get food.

1801
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:02,641
At four whistles,
you will become food for the worms.

1802
01:48:04,328 --> 01:48:08,204
And finally..
- Please. Let me guess. TV?

1803
01:48:08,246 --> 01:48:09,813
Yes. You are getting smarter.
- Thank you.

1804
01:48:09,937 --> 01:48:14,090
In our TV,
we just provide one channel.

1805
01:48:14,206 --> 01:48:16,661
Which movies?
- Only devotional movies.

1806
01:48:16,703 --> 01:48:19,706
Screw the elections. Please keep
aside a couple of it for me also.

1807
01:48:19,748 --> 01:48:21,038
I will beat you to pulp.

1808
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:22,372
At least save one for me.

1809
01:48:22,663 --> 01:48:26,703
So these are the special products
we are providing to gain votes.

1810
01:48:26,745 --> 01:48:28,910
People don't vote for
functional products these days

1811
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:31,524
who will vote for us
if you give scrap products.

1812
01:48:31,581 --> 01:48:34,248
The sole reason of giving
is to make people not to vote.

1813
01:48:34,374 --> 01:48:36,206
What do you mean?
Please explain clearly

1814
01:48:36,248 --> 01:48:39,998
If we give the cooker this way,
it becomes a problem for us.

1815
01:48:40,544 --> 01:48:41,801
What if we give this the other way?

1816
01:48:44,152 --> 01:48:45,540
It becomes problematic for them.

1817
01:48:45,614 --> 01:48:48,213
So, what happens to those
ten thousand cookers

1818
01:48:48,258 --> 01:48:49,967
if we give out ten cookers like this?

1819
01:48:50,041 --> 01:48:53,414
Means a major flop case!

1820
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:08,592
Look, none of them from our generation
has managed to make such an impact.

1821
01:49:09,489 --> 01:49:10,418
Come, sit.

1822
01:49:11,606 --> 01:49:14,758
There are already so many fans.
- Yes.

1823
01:49:14,790 --> 01:49:17,992
I cannot imagine how many more fans
I'll make after the elections..

1824
01:49:18,066 --> 01:49:20,222
I doubt if you'll be available to
catch up with us once it's over.

1825
01:49:20,254 --> 01:49:22,101
Oh goodness! Enough already.

1826
01:49:22,175 --> 01:49:26,260
This is just a show off. These people
are paid to act in such a way,

1827
01:49:26,317 --> 01:49:29,159
Appu..
- Fire, mom, fire..

1828
01:49:29,186 --> 01:49:30,658
What?
- Nothing.

1829
01:49:30,690 --> 01:49:34,116
I am asking them to get fire and cake.
Hurry up, man. Bring it fast.

1830
01:49:34,162 --> 01:49:35,227
Let's start it.

1831
01:49:35,450 --> 01:49:37,004
Light up.
- Happy anniversary!

1832
01:49:46,124 --> 01:49:49,958
Dad, what do have
against love marriages?

1833
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,080
Love marriage, huh!

1834
01:49:51,122 --> 01:49:52,998
Look at the guy sitting at that table.

1835
01:49:53,754 --> 01:49:56,459
What? - It seems like he's been
in love for 18 years.

1836
01:49:56,646 --> 01:50:03,521
His face is as blank as a pumpkin.
He's lost clarity in life.

1837
01:50:03,721 --> 01:50:09,248
You tell me,
do think any boy is happy in love?

1838
01:50:09,584 --> 01:50:11,127
Many people are happy.
- Show me anyone.

1839
01:50:11,337 --> 01:50:12,333
Sir, you are Appu Anna right?

1840
01:50:12,375 --> 01:50:17,122
Yeah.. - Hey, call him Appanna,
what is that Appu Anna?

1841
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:18,746
Leave him, you tell me.

1842
01:50:18,788 --> 01:50:20,211
Sir, it's me Madesh.

1843
01:50:20,268 --> 01:50:22,976
When I was in final year college,
I fell in love with a girl called Aishu.

1844
01:50:23,569 --> 01:50:25,459
You helped me in getting married.

1845
01:50:26,961 --> 01:50:28,815
Madesh, hope you doing well.

1846
01:50:28,912 --> 01:50:32,958
With your help,
we got married and living happilly

1847
01:50:33,252 --> 01:50:35,156
Super super

1848
01:50:35,188 --> 01:50:37,808
Sir, in this bill,
do not pay the GST amount

1849
01:50:38,028 --> 01:50:39,819
I will talk to the owner
and provide you a discount.

1850
01:50:39,878 --> 01:50:42,080
Hey, those formalities not required.

1851
01:50:42,248 --> 01:50:44,580
Please sir, for my happiness.
- Yes, thank you.

1852
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:48,925
Lion..
How was it?

1853
01:50:50,828 --> 01:50:54,038
Mom, we got discount on GST.
- This is his set up.

1854
01:50:54,111 --> 01:50:57,837
Didn't he told not to pay GST.

1855
01:50:57,888 --> 01:51:00,586
He would have paid him earlier
including GST.

1856
01:51:01,112 --> 01:51:05,664
Excuse me.
Sir, are you Prof. Narayan? - Yes.

1857
01:51:05,706 --> 01:51:07,978
It's me Satish.
- Is this your set up?

1858
01:51:08,711 --> 01:51:11,038
When I was in college,
I was in love with a girl..

1859
01:51:11,124 --> 01:51:13,098
Why did you fall in love!

1860
01:51:13,119 --> 01:51:15,117
And you slapped me and advised.

1861
01:51:15,869 --> 01:51:19,787
I gave up love. Today I am
the owner of this hotel.

1862
01:51:20,117 --> 01:51:23,367
And also I have 5 branches.
- Wow!

1863
01:51:23,451 --> 01:51:27,408
It's your blessing, sir.
Please bless me.

1864
01:51:27,450 --> 01:51:30,576
Open 5 more hotels.
- Stay happy.

1865
01:51:31,164 --> 01:51:33,576
Sir, you do not need
to pay the bill.

1866
01:51:33,660 --> 01:51:35,324
Who gave you the bill?

1867
01:51:35,408 --> 01:51:37,648
Sir, no need to pay the bill.

1868
01:51:37,677 --> 01:51:39,833
If you need parcels of food,
I'll send it to you.

1869
01:51:40,125 --> 01:51:41,613
All I need is your blessings.

1870
01:51:41,878 --> 01:51:42,856
Have a good day, sir.

1871
01:51:47,663 --> 01:51:48,773
After all, GST...!

1872
01:51:50,579 --> 01:51:51,955
Bill!

1873
01:51:52,284 --> 01:51:56,619
If your lion,
I am the lion king.

1874
01:51:56,661 --> 01:52:00,940
Anyways, we both will wait
in the car parking area.

1875
01:52:00,986 --> 01:52:02,695
You both have a good time.

1876
01:52:02,895 --> 01:52:05,315
At this table?
What an idea!

1877
01:52:05,614 --> 01:52:07,894
My darling daddy.
It's your day.

1878
01:52:08,164 --> 01:52:09,833
Happy anniversary again!
- Thank you, my dear son.

1879
01:52:10,055 --> 01:52:12,615
Let's go. - I didn't get my icecream.
- I'll buy you, come.

1880
01:52:12,689 --> 01:52:15,654
My boy is a monkey. - Ha?
- But a lovable monkey.

1881
01:52:18,048 --> 01:52:19,209
Aruna..

1882
01:52:20,241 --> 01:52:22,679
It's been twenty five years
since we got married.

1883
01:52:24,091 --> 01:52:26,343
I feel like buying
you something today.

1884
01:52:26,872 --> 01:52:28,247
Tell me, what do you want?

1885
01:52:29,675 --> 01:52:31,202
I want nothing.

1886
01:52:31,286 --> 01:52:33,365
Ask for whatever you want.

1887
01:52:34,919 --> 01:52:36,794
I don't want any gifts.

1888
01:52:37,014 --> 01:52:39,415
But I want to ask you a question.
- Go ahead, ask me.

1889
01:52:40,286 --> 01:52:44,288
Why were you angry
on our wedding day?

1890
01:52:44,908 --> 01:52:46,791
Why do want to know those things now?

1891
01:52:46,865 --> 01:52:51,265
I asked if you wanted a gift, instead
why do you want to go into flashback?

1892
01:52:51,490 --> 01:52:53,680
I did ask your dad
about it that day..

1893
01:52:54,754 --> 01:52:56,631
I mean, the reason for your anger.

1894
01:52:57,034 --> 01:53:00,334
He said that he didn't get you married
to that girl because she was not right.

1895
01:53:00,423 --> 01:53:01,983
And that's why you were angry.

1896
01:53:02,343 --> 01:53:05,207
How could he know if Lalitha
was right or wrong?

1897
01:53:05,668 --> 01:53:07,393
I didn't mention Lalitha did I?

1898
01:53:09,498 --> 01:53:10,617
You didn't mention?

1899
01:53:11,996 --> 01:53:13,008
Let it be.

1900
01:53:14,233 --> 01:53:18,434
Apparently bad memories will trouble
a person for a short period of time

1901
01:53:19,495 --> 01:53:23,416
but good memories will trouble
a person until he dies.

1902
01:53:23,952 --> 01:53:28,241
Why did you marry me?
Because your dad forced you to?

1903
01:53:28,848 --> 01:53:32,792
I don't know. I cannot ask him
because he's passed on.

1904
01:53:33,686 --> 01:53:38,244
In the future if you get your son
married to a girl against his will

1905
01:53:39,418 --> 01:53:44,492
he will go through
what you are going through. No?

1906
01:53:45,161 --> 01:53:48,828
He will have to live without
a Lalitha all his life.

1907
01:53:51,862 --> 01:53:54,643
When we leave something
for our children to inherit

1908
01:53:55,079 --> 01:53:58,615
it should be something that will
invoke good memories about us.

1909
01:54:01,145 --> 01:54:04,592
This is the only gift
I am asking from you

1910
01:54:05,642 --> 01:54:07,716
that too in all these
twenty five years.

1911
01:54:09,438 --> 01:54:10,482
Wipe your tears.

1912
01:54:13,288 --> 01:54:15,957
If your son sees you crying,
he'll assume that

1913
01:54:16,241 --> 01:54:20,609
his dad's given in and bring
a girl home tomorrow itself!

1914
01:54:25,078 --> 01:54:27,122
Shall we move?

1915
01:54:29,201 --> 01:54:30,551
Things need to go my way.

1916
01:54:32,051 --> 01:54:33,244
I'm not going to
take no for an answer

1917
01:54:34,068 --> 01:54:35,718
Or else you know
what's going to happen!

1918
01:54:35,827 --> 01:54:38,454
Dad!
- I'll call you back.

1919
01:54:38,494 --> 01:54:41,576
What is it? You said everything
was going to turn out fine.

1920
01:54:42,478 --> 01:54:43,634
But see what happened.

1921
01:54:45,369 --> 01:54:47,163
He is not someone
you can take lightly, Dad.

1922
01:54:47,710 --> 01:54:49,724
We lost money on one hand
and respect on the other.

1923
01:54:51,900 --> 01:54:55,580
So in total how many
cooker blasts took place?

1924
01:54:56,828 --> 01:54:58,040
Ten.

1925
01:55:01,868 --> 01:55:03,232
Not 10.

1926
01:55:03,494 --> 01:55:04,468
There were 11 blasts.

1927
01:55:06,682 --> 01:55:07,762
Go check properly.

1928
01:55:14,577 --> 01:55:16,821
Mom..
Sorry, mom.

1929
01:55:20,159 --> 01:55:21,663
Mother!
- Aruna..

1930
01:55:29,359 --> 01:55:31,860
Appu, console yourself.

1931
01:55:32,438 --> 01:55:35,496
None of the cookers that we assembled
were strong enough to kill anyone.

1932
01:55:35,580 --> 01:55:37,997
Someone else is behind this.

1933
01:55:38,115 --> 01:55:41,703
Sir, I'm her daughter and please
don't get me wrong for saying this.

1934
01:55:41,745 --> 01:55:44,247
Why are you playing around with
innocent lives for personal gain?

1935
01:55:44,373 --> 01:55:46,654
What happened to your mother
could have happened to mine.

1936
01:55:46,679 --> 01:55:48,131
And who then would have taken
responsibility for that?

1937
01:55:48,163 --> 01:55:51,201
I asked you to stop indulging in such things
when my grandfather was sent to jail.

1938
01:55:51,243 --> 01:55:52,622
But you ignored me and see
what happened now. See, grandpa!

1939
01:55:54,742 --> 01:55:56,959
Appu.
- Tell me dad.

1940
01:55:57,822 --> 01:56:01,451
In these many years,
I as a father

1941
01:56:02,929 --> 01:56:05,434
have never done anything that
you have asked me to, right?

1942
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:08,318
Nothing like that, Father.

1943
01:56:10,115 --> 01:56:12,105
It's not like you will feel
comfortable telling me so anyway.

1944
01:56:13,233 --> 01:56:15,973
Why do you think a father
reprimands a son?

1945
01:56:16,618 --> 01:56:19,122
So that he corrects his wrong doings
and falls right back on track.

1946
01:56:19,622 --> 01:56:21,314
No. That's when he is young maybe.

1947
01:56:21,801 --> 01:56:23,446
But if a father does so
to his grown up son.

1948
01:56:23,534 --> 01:56:26,907
It means he is trying to see if he still
has any control over his son's life!

1949
01:56:28,410 --> 01:56:29,950
A father may have 50 crore rupees

1950
01:56:29,991 --> 01:56:32,548
to pass on to his children
but that's not the real asset.

1951
01:56:33,405 --> 01:56:36,669
The real asset is in fact
to have a grown up child

1952
01:56:37,415 --> 01:56:40,747
who out of respect does not cross
question his father's opinion.

1953
01:56:41,293 --> 01:56:43,328
That's the real asset.

1954
01:56:44,996 --> 01:56:50,080
Please forgive me if I have
hurt you in anyway.

1955
01:56:50,870 --> 01:56:55,205
Dad, you have nothing to apologize for.

1956
01:56:55,576 --> 01:57:00,453
It's been 25 years since
your mother came into my life.

1957
01:57:01,909 --> 01:57:07,163
Yesterday, for the first time
she asked me for something.

1958
01:57:08,368 --> 01:57:14,037
She wanted me to be okay with
our children's choice of life partners.

1959
01:57:15,617 --> 01:57:18,457
She will be around to
see your wedding, right?

1960
01:57:19,867 --> 01:57:24,497
I'll make sure she is.
- She will be alive, right?

1961
01:57:25,535 --> 01:57:29,080
Politics is the last resort of scoundrels.

1962
01:57:29,620 --> 01:57:32,172
I mean, criminals are looking
to fall back on politics

1963
01:57:32,223 --> 01:57:34,425
to further their evil motives.

1964
01:57:34,993 --> 01:57:38,877
Appanna's close aides
have used our party symbol

1965
01:57:38,975 --> 01:57:42,322
and distributed those faulty cookers.

1966
01:57:43,403 --> 01:57:47,034
This is the CCTV footage from a house,
where one of the blasts took place.

1967
01:57:47,076 --> 01:57:53,789
Also he has harmed his own mother
to gain sympathy votes

1968
01:57:54,293 --> 01:57:57,335
and this is when I realised that politics
is the last resort of scoundrels!

1969
01:57:57,581 --> 01:57:59,757
Politics need these scoundrels.

1970
01:57:59,887 --> 01:58:01,670
I leave to the people.

1971
01:58:01,978 --> 01:58:08,390
India is the only place where Politics
tout death as a powerful pawn.

1972
01:58:10,253 --> 01:58:11,372
Thank you very much.

1973
01:58:13,830 --> 01:58:19,164
If you want to marry my daughter,
withdraw from the fray.

1974
01:58:21,999 --> 01:58:25,260
My son has to win this election.

1975
01:58:25,437 --> 01:58:29,074
For that to happen, Appu has
to withdraw his candidature.

1976
01:58:29,284 --> 01:58:32,264
If you try to wriggle
out of this situation

1977
01:58:32,363 --> 01:58:35,611
saying you are incapable of
making this happen

1978
01:58:35,654 --> 01:58:39,223
and it's also not good to mix
politics and relationships.

1979
01:58:39,423 --> 01:58:40,737
I'll tell you a story.

1980
01:58:41,386 --> 01:58:45,627
Very soon you will
have a man claiming

1981
01:58:45,677 --> 01:58:48,460
that your company is built
on agricultural land.

1982
01:58:48,815 --> 01:58:52,887
Once this happens your name
will be all over the media.

1983
01:58:52,918 --> 01:58:55,453
Jagannath Sharma.
Jaganath Sharma. Jaganath Sharma

1984
01:58:57,202 --> 01:59:02,393
Obviously you will
then turn to me for help.

1985
01:59:02,744 --> 01:59:04,550
At that point

1986
01:59:05,994 --> 01:59:11,203
I'll call a press meet and
accuse you of trying to bribe me.

1987
01:59:11,693 --> 01:59:14,637
So now if you go to court,
it will become a civil case

1988
01:59:15,283 --> 01:59:17,886
and if you come to me,
it will become a criminal case!

1989
01:59:18,829 --> 01:59:20,460
So, Sharma sir think carefully.

1990
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:23,483
Or else just find your daughter a
suitable groom and get her married.

1991
01:59:23,542 --> 01:59:24,566
Let her be happy.

1992
01:59:24,910 --> 01:59:25,479
But, sir..

1993
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:28,574
You know who I am,
but what I am capable of

1994
01:59:30,596 --> 01:59:33,022
Mr Sharma, that's something
that's beyond your comprehension!

1995
01:59:33,950 --> 01:59:39,644
You always asked me if you were good
enough. You most definitely are.

1996
01:59:40,138 --> 01:59:42,708
It's just that I could
not see your positives

1997
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:45,542
as I compared you with
somebody else always.

1998
01:59:46,387 --> 01:59:50,410
An ex-minister is feeling
threatened by your candidature.

1999
01:59:51,537 --> 01:59:54,603
That itself should tell you
how great you are!

2000
01:59:55,561 --> 02:00:00,247
But those people can stoop down
to any level to win this battle.

2001
02:00:01,497 --> 02:00:03,206
Withdraw from the race.

2002
02:00:07,456 --> 02:00:10,041
Appanna's withdrawal
has more or less ensured

2003
02:00:10,191 --> 02:00:14,594
Shashank Radhakrishna's win
in this election.

2004
02:00:15,122 --> 02:00:18,998
This development has brought
in a celebratory mood

2005
02:00:19,059 --> 02:00:21,144
among Shashank's party workers.

2006
02:00:21,344 --> 02:00:25,335
We bring you live footage
from his home...

2007
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:41,831
Hello! Hello!

2008
02:00:42,953 --> 02:00:44,286
Ya, ya it's us only.

2009
02:00:44,328 --> 02:00:47,516
You think I have had a change of heart
and am here to congratulate you?

2010
02:00:47,669 --> 02:00:50,841
Not at all. - First of all..
- First let's garland him.

2011
02:00:50,906 --> 02:00:51,859
Okay, okay!

2012
02:00:53,737 --> 02:00:54,389
Now tell.

2013
02:00:54,463 --> 02:00:56,496
First we came,
next news will come!

2014
02:00:56,761 --> 02:00:58,003
BREAKING NEWS!

2015
02:00:58,035 --> 02:01:00,721
A stay has been brought on the announcment
of Malleshwaram by-election.

2016
02:01:00,778 --> 02:01:03,043
Electoral fraud is being suspected
and the candidature of frontrunner

2017
02:01:03,075 --> 02:01:05,501
Shashank Radhakrishnan is likely
to be disqualified.

2018
02:01:05,533 --> 02:01:07,869
Judgement from Supreme court.

2019
02:01:08,122 --> 02:01:11,161
I'm sure you want to know
how I pulled this off?

2020
02:01:11,291 --> 02:01:14,190
But I'm not the one who is behind
all this, he is. Wait I'll call him.

2021
02:01:55,704 --> 02:01:56,354
How was it?

2022
02:01:56,939 --> 02:01:58,815
Grandpa, you?
- Yes, yes.

2023
02:01:59,377 --> 02:02:00,148
Dad?

2024
02:02:00,180 --> 02:02:01,745
Yes!

2025
02:02:01,911 --> 02:02:04,112
I'm sure you want to know
how we got him on our side.

2026
02:02:04,156 --> 02:02:05,442
Let's cut to the flashback.

2027
02:02:05,737 --> 02:02:07,370
Sir, you look very familiar.

2028
02:02:07,528 --> 02:02:10,009
LIC agent Shyam Rao?
- Shyam Rao, who?

2029
02:02:10,048 --> 02:02:11,673
The one who visited
our old age home.

2030
02:02:11,833 --> 02:02:14,771
Anyway, he is minister
Radhakrishna's father.

2031
02:02:16,409 --> 02:02:18,831
He is Shashank's grandfather.
- Grandpa..

2032
02:02:19,746 --> 02:02:24,622
LIC agent Shyam Rao is here, come
I'll introduce you to him - No thanks.

2033
02:02:24,789 --> 02:02:29,622
But he is... - You told us that he
is an LIC agent, we remember.

2034
02:02:29,745 --> 02:02:31,372
You go and chat over coffee
or tea with him, please go.

2035
02:02:33,538 --> 02:02:36,578
I'm so sorry, how would I know,
just let this go.

2036
02:02:36,662 --> 02:02:38,582
Sir, I had spoken to you
about that election issue.

2037
02:02:38,750 --> 02:02:41,456
Oh! That's you is it?
- Yes, sir.

2038
02:02:41,828 --> 02:02:47,221
In 2011 Bihar elections,
an MLA candidate

2039
02:02:47,628 --> 02:02:49,447
got LIC policies done for
his constituency voters

2040
02:02:49,567 --> 02:02:52,193
instead of buying them with cash.

2041
02:02:52,660 --> 02:02:56,097
However, he got caught as he had
made the financial transactions

2042
02:02:56,451 --> 02:02:59,853
through his own personal account.

2043
02:03:01,579 --> 02:03:11,945
I'll get insurance cover for all the
20,000 voters in your constituency.

2044
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:12,868
Wow!

2045
02:03:12,910 --> 02:03:17,956
But it's for you guys to figure
out a way to get the money

2046
02:03:18,698 --> 02:03:20,258
transferred from his account!

2047
02:03:20,683 --> 02:03:21,461
Our reponsibility?

2048
02:03:21,869 --> 02:03:26,789
Bad news is they are
investing in your company.

2049
02:03:27,703 --> 02:03:31,956
I am overtaking IT company
and blacklisting you.

2050
02:03:46,787 --> 02:03:49,306
This foreign brand
tastes really good

2051
02:03:49,595 --> 02:03:53,409
Let bygones be bygones Shashank.
I'm sorry okay!

2052
02:03:55,287 --> 02:03:59,122
After doing all the damage, you think
your sorry is going to make it all okay?

2053
02:04:00,541 --> 02:04:04,789
I wasn't talking about the elections.
I'm sorry for that.

2054
02:04:15,041 --> 02:04:16,372
Happy?

2055
02:04:18,916 --> 02:04:21,248
All this is fine, but still..

2056
02:04:21,290 --> 02:04:23,840
Don't tell me you are still
hung up on the election episode!

2057
02:04:23,890 --> 02:04:25,470
There is always another election.

2058
02:04:25,544 --> 02:04:27,954
I'm sure your father is already
drafting the next course of action.

2059
02:04:27,996 --> 02:04:32,170
So don't worry! There is also the
possibility of you becoming an MLC.

2060
02:04:32,370 --> 02:04:33,372
Let's say that also does not happen

2061
02:04:33,426 --> 02:04:36,145
your followers will make you become
the party president at least.

2062
02:04:36,177 --> 02:04:39,622
And even if all this fails,
your father is loaded.

2063
02:04:39,761 --> 02:04:43,072
He will produce a movie for you
and make you a hero!

2064
02:04:43,126 --> 02:04:44,722
You are still in a good place
as you have so many options.

2065
02:04:44,756 --> 02:04:45,834
But imagine my fate!

2066
02:04:45,866 --> 02:04:47,748
I became a victim of your revenge
story and inturn landed up

2067
02:04:47,782 --> 02:04:50,952
becoming the troll content for
my family for generations to come!

2068
02:04:53,958 --> 02:04:56,207
Anyways, good luck and
all the very best. - Thank you.

2069
02:05:02,870 --> 02:05:06,163
Looks like everyone's having
a sound discussion.

2070
02:05:06,203 --> 02:05:08,456
Doing good, dude? - All cool.
- Father.. - What is it?

2071
02:05:08,497 --> 02:05:11,055
Dad, the wedding card is almost fine.

2072
02:05:11,365 --> 02:05:13,751
But can we tweak the name
from Appanna weds Abhignya

2073
02:05:13,797 --> 02:05:16,766
to Appu weds Abhi in a cute way.

2074
02:05:18,078 --> 02:05:22,930
You fool.
The seed can't be changed

2075
02:05:23,298 --> 02:05:26,751
after a tree grows awkwardly.

2076
02:05:26,983 --> 02:05:28,218
Let it be the way it is.

2077
02:05:28,544 --> 02:05:30,787
Ask her if it's right or wrong.

2078
02:05:31,910 --> 02:05:35,855
Abhi, I have checked it all.
It seems fine.

2079
02:05:35,887 --> 02:05:38,079
You cross check it once.
We'll finalize it.

2080
02:05:39,036 --> 02:05:41,199
You checked it, right?
Why are you asking me about it?

2081
02:05:43,701 --> 02:05:46,160
I feel something is on fire.

2082
02:05:46,202 --> 02:05:49,122
Isn't it?
I can smell the smoke too.

2083
02:05:49,164 --> 02:05:51,660
Can never understand girls no.
- No chance!

2084
02:05:51,702 --> 02:05:52,915
They don't tell what the problem is.

2085
02:05:53,052 --> 02:05:54,503
They don't tell what the solution is.

2086
02:05:54,997 --> 02:05:56,518
What wrong did I do?

2087
02:06:00,417 --> 02:06:03,972
Many many happy returns of the day, ma'am.

2088
02:06:04,522 --> 02:06:09,858
I brought you your favorite
pineapple cake with extra cheese.

2089
02:06:09,919 --> 02:06:11,059
I have made it myself.

2090
02:06:11,373 --> 02:06:12,539
Thank you so much.

2091
02:06:13,344 --> 02:06:14,510
You're going to have it from me.

2092
02:06:14,912 --> 02:06:18,164
Have a good day ma'am.
Have a good day..

2093
02:06:18,817 --> 02:06:19,801
He's finished.

2094
02:06:21,206 --> 02:06:21,804
Abhi..

2095
02:06:23,901 --> 02:06:25,161
Happy birthday..

2096
02:06:25,277 --> 02:06:26,539
Get lost.

2097
02:06:26,581 --> 02:06:28,417
Pack up. All leave. Scene over.

2098
02:06:28,702 --> 02:06:32,331
He didn't wish your birthday yet?
- Didn't you wish the little girl yet?

2099
02:06:33,690 --> 02:06:34,542
This is how you do two at a time..

2100
02:06:34,578 --> 02:06:37,316
Oye. I am better than you, man.

2101
02:06:37,391 --> 02:06:41,244
Your mom's last birthday
I kept an alarm at 12 am.

2102
02:06:41,444 --> 02:06:44,914
Made sweets for her and
fed it myself and wished her.

2103
02:06:45,701 --> 02:06:51,695
I used to take my scooter and
wish my girlfriend sharp at 12 am

2104
02:06:51,895 --> 02:06:55,842
by climbing her balcony and
give her a rose. You know?

2105
02:06:55,869 --> 02:07:00,166
Who were you talking to on the phone then at 12 lastnight?
You weren't wishing her?

2106
02:07:00,198 --> 02:07:01,026
Mom!

2107
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:03,789
If my boyfriend behaved this way
I wouldn't have got married only.

2108
02:07:03,831 --> 02:07:04,789
Hey!

2109
02:07:05,084 --> 02:07:07,324
Dad. I think I should re-think
about this marriage.

2110
02:07:07,366 --> 02:07:11,122
You want to rethink because of such
a silly thing? What's happening here?

2111
02:07:11,173 --> 02:07:14,956
My birthday is a silly thing for you?
I am leaving.

2112
02:07:18,090 --> 02:07:19,553
Abhi..
What to do now?

2113
02:07:20,080 --> 02:07:21,539
Cancel means we need to move on.

2114
02:07:21,665 --> 02:07:23,039
Even you too?

2115
02:07:23,333 --> 02:07:26,581
Abhi.. Abhi.
I was trying to surprise you.

2116
02:07:28,288 --> 02:07:30,902
I said it on that day
and I am saying it today.

2117
02:07:31,911 --> 02:07:37,614
I'll come millennium after millennium
to destroy his love after love
