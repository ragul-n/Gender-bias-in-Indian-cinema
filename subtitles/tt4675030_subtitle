00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,340
Where are you going?

3
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:20,474
Pyari, wait up!

4
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,951
Pyari, don't go inside.

5
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,752
Oh god, she went in!

6
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,166
Have you gone mad?

7
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:45,539
How many times have I told you
not to loiter around this mansion!

8
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,078
- Dad, Pyari..
- To hell with her!

9
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:50,341
Save your life and flee from here.

10
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,905
C'mon, do you want to die!

11
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,747
I've repeatedly told you
not to go there! You'll get killed!

12
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:55,808
C'mon!

13
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:22,138
"Fun and frolic.. great and grand!"

14
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,875
WOW!

15
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,667
"When my eyes fell on your hips,
a hoot escaped my lips."

16
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,104

yearning for you."

00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,044
"My nights are spent

19
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,377
"If you don't yield,
your heart will compel you."

20
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,916

"Fun and frolic.."

24
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:14,095
"Darling, throw a party first.
Darling, buy me a margarita."

25
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:18,863
"Darling, when it gets heady,
you can do whatever you want."

26
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:23,771
"Darling, take me on a long drive first.
Darling, gift me a diamond."

27
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,904
"Darling, take me to your parents,
then you can do whatever you want."

28
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,380
"When my eyes fell on your hips,

"O baby, your looks are killer.
Different is your style."

38
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:11,885
"God must have made you on a Sunday.
O girl, you're mesmerizing!"

39
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:16,825
"O baby, your looks are killer.
Different is your style."

40
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:22,093

"Fun and frolic.."

55
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,099
How long has it been ringing?

56
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,203
Sir, the bell isn't ringing here,
but there.

57
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,615
Oh, sorry.

58
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:48,583
Have you had this problem before?

59
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:49,584
No.

60
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,484
- Family history?
- Not at all.

61
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,418
Let me check.

62
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,732
My wife.

63
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,362
Hi baby!

64
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,563
Hi sweetheart!

65
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,603
Do you remember that
we've to visit the guru today?

66
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:13,575
Oh, I'm so sorry. I have
a patient waiting, I can't come.

67
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,442
But baby, I had told you“

68
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:17,213
Listen up!

69
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,080
We've to leave for the
guru's place in an hour.

70
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,846
Damn you!

71
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,649
- Stand straight.
- What did you say?

72
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,279
No, I mean I can't come.

73
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,289
Look, stop being stubborn.

74
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,849
Stop it, sir!

75
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,486
I won't!

76
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,323
You've to visit the guru or else..

77
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:41,862
Look, mom-in-law,
I'm not going to let you crush me!

78
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,607
Then get out of my house.

79
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,804
- I'll be there in an hour.
- That's like it.

80
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,680
Oh, you're suffering from hernia.

81
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,782
I didn't have it before
the check-up, sir.

82
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:11,591
Life's changing every moment.

83
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,365
Somewhere life's pleasure,
somewhere it's pain.

84
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,636
Hence, live to the
fullest every moment.

85
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,574
This mood and moment
will never come back.

86
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:27,051
Out.. out“ run out!

87
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:30,383
Wow! The guru is sharing
such great knowledge.

88
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,548
He's not sharing knowledge,
but testing my patience.

89
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,315
- Sire..
- Yes?

90
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:39,921
Since you've said that my late husband
wishes to return to this world..

91
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,795
...that too through
my daughter's womb..

92
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:45,663
...I've made a total
donation of 12.5 millions.

93
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:49,672
See that? Her patience is
being put through a test of fire.

94
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:53,432
There has been no news of her beloved.

95
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,670
Yes, sire. Until dad doesn't
tell you the time of his arrival..

96
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:01,514
...I've not let him even touch
me until then, just like you advised.

97
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,816
The one who has to come, will come.

98
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,447
Damn your lie!

99
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,292
I mean, he'll be here in an hour.
It's already been six months.

100
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:14,388
Master, it's time
to contact the spirits.

101
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,931
'Fearless and brave.'

102
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,398
- Your husband's name?
- Ravi

103
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:23,633
Shastri, the cricketer?

104
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:24,766
Oh god, when did he die?

105
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,070
Ravi Mehra.

106
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,943
OK, Mehra.

107
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,943
'Come, let's find the road to love.'

108
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:49,898
Come.. come..

109
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:50,899
What happened, sire?

110
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:54,871
The communication is breaking, I
think the offering was a little less.

111
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,339
No, don't do that!
I'm willing to spend.

112
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,602
Give it, dear.

113
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,176
Here, try once again.

114
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,941
Praise the lord!

115
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:14,413
Come.. come..

116
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,153
It seems the communication
is breaking again.

117
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:19,628
Don't stop,
I'm willing to give everything.

118
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:23,690
Come.. come..

119
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:28,262
Come.. come..

120
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:34,676
Come.. come..

121
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:40,207
Here he is. Shower him with petals!

122
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,614
Your beloved has arrived,
wearing slippers.

123
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,086
- He's here?
- Yes, Ravi.

124
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,349
- He's come?
- Yes.

125
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,947
Master, ask dad-in-law
about the time of his arrival.

126
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,117
Just a second.

127
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,252
Since you've arrived in the world,
you've to live.

128
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,160
If life's poison,
you'll have to drink it.

129
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,923
He says, between 7.00 to 7.30 p.m.

130
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,434
You'll have to keep your word, oldie.

131
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:01,869
And you'll have to
accept this blessing.

132
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,099
I'm not eating this.

133
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,175
Dare you refuse the guru!
Don't forget.

134
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,641
Yes, I know that I live in your house.

135
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,336
Yes.

136
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,572
I'll leave now.

137
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,450
Do come again.

138
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,486
Master, you've given him
a sweetmeat laced with opium..

139
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:19,852
...marijuana, hashish and heroin.

140
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,523
Now see him perform.

141
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,496
Darling, I'm ready.

142
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:33,560
What have you done to yourself?
What's with your look?

143
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,997
Mom, come quickly.

144
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,701
What is the matter?
Why are you shouting? -Look at this.

145
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,836
What have you done to yourself?

146
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,207
Aren't you ashamed?

147
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:52,015
Why are you spitting?
Have you gone mad?

148
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,656
Darling, why are you acting crazy?

149
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,126
I've been trying to explain to you“

150
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,891
Don't bother,
he's not going to understand.

151
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,529
Baby, please.
It's time for dad's arrival. Hurry up.

152
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:05,601
Hurry up for what?

153
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,467
He's been bitten by a mad dog.

154
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,028
That's why he's behaving like this.

155
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,904
Please baby, hurry up.

156
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,510
But with whom?

157
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:30,525
Over here, the penthouse is beautiful
and the basement is dilapidated.

158
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,764
And here,
it's evergreen at the bottom.

159
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,325
...and barren at the top.

160
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,231
What?!

161
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,965
This guru has given
a very bad exchange offer.

162
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,007
I think it's up to me now.

163
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,410
You're going to be reborn today, baby.

164
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,414
Move!

165
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,410
Hey, why are you shouting?

166
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,751
Let's hack off the head, we'll celebrate
the wedding night after that.

167
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,924
Instead of inviting
my husband back home..

168
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,060
...you were trying
to send me to heaven!

169
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,503
Even the auspicious time has passed.

170
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:19,569
Tonight, you're going
to sleep here on the street.

171
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:27,578
Sir, when you see the penthouse..

172
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,086
...you'll buy it immediately.

173
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,453
Hello?

174
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:37,016
Hey Prem,
sell-off my mansion at Doodhwadi.

175
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,523
I can't live at my
mom-in-law's house anymore.

176
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:43,589
Amar, I'm driving right now.
I'm with a client.

177
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:44,599
We'll talk later, 0k?

178
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,661
You're an expert con.

179
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,969
You manage to sell the worst houses.

180
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,169
What nonsense are you talking, Amar?

181
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:56,702
You're a rascal of the first order!

182
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:02,315
To earn your commission, you even
sell off a tent house for a penthouse.

183
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,754
Amar, what nonsense are you talking?

184
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,285
He was joking.

185
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,723
Here's your tent.. penthouse.

186
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,268
Amar, you scoundrel!

187
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:23,767
Amar, you moron!
Cursed dog! He ruined my deal!

188
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,706
Brother-in-law, statue! - Hi..

189
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:28,738
You've to remain stiff now.

190
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,038
Tickle.. tickle..

191
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,746
Tickle.. tickle..

192
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:42,892
Tickle.. tickle..

193
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,257
You shook!

194
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:52,132
You shook!

195
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,296
Sister, come quickly.
Look, Prem shook.

196
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,404
Sister, come fast. See, Prem shook.

197
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,372
What's this? Why are you screaming?

198
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,602
What's all the noise about?

199
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,201
- See..
- Shut up!

200
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,301
Nothing.

201
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,905
It's good that you came. I
wanted to talk to you about something.

202
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,506
What is it?

203
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,449
I want some money.

204
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,575
How much?

205
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:10,484
Just a million.

206
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,852
A million! Have you gone mad?

207
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,583
Money doesn't grow on trees.

208
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,191
Actually,
Choti has a course in London.

209
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,454
She has to go and live
there for two months.

210
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,132
What?! Choti has to live
separately for two months?

211
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,632
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

212
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,498
I'll try and sell
a house tomorrow itself.

213
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:30,064
Yeah! I'll go and tell
all my friends right away.

214
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,369
You're the best!

215
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,505
Bye, Prem.

216
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,176
Bye.

217
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,577
- Your feelings for my sister..
- Yes?

218
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,640
...I appreciate it a lot.

219
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,378
What do you mean?

220
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,446
She's my sister,
but you considered her your own..

221
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,185
...and agreed to give
her a million rupees.

222
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,318
Yes, but you don't
understand my feelings.

223
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:54,421
Since your sister came to live with us,
we've been living like siblings.

224
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,958
"Come, get into my blanket."

225
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,935
Welcome to my blanket.

226
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,368
- Choti!
- Choti? Ignore her.

227
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,338
I can't ignore her.

228
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,877
No, please don't.. Choti!

229
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:12,108
- What is it, Choti?
- I'm feeling very scared.

230
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,315
I saw a very bad dream.

231
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,545
I won't sleep alone.

232
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,848
I want to sleep between you and Prem.

233
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:20,287
What happened?

234
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,655
Sister, there's a rat in your bed.
It rubbed against me.

235
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,591
No, Choti. There is no rat on the bed.

236
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,628
There is. I want to check.

237
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:26,992
- No, Choti..
- Yes.

238
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,623
- Yes.
- No.

239
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,529
Choti, don't worry.

240
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:36,071
Even if there was a rat,
it ran back into the hole in fear.

241
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:40,499
Nisha, you both can sleep here,
I'll sleep outside. OK?

242
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,807
What do I do? She's a kid,
she doesn't understand all this.

243
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,781
Just let her go to London once..

244
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,878
...and I promise that every night
will be a wedding night for us.

245
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,253
Really? If that is so..

246
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,883
...then I'll surely sell
the house to Pawan Lodha tomorrow.

247
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,730
Good morning,
Mr. and Mrs. Lodha. Welcome!

248
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:04,062
You won't find a better bungalow
than this to start your married life.

249
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,701
Come, I'll show you the
special features of this bungalow.

250
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:07,827
- Please come.
- Sure.

251
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,897
See this,
a lake in front of the bungalow.

252
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,670
A valley in front of the lake.

253
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:16,645
And most important,
a hill in front of the valley.

254
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,141
Well, what's so special
about this hill?

255
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:26,247
This is the mountain where
if a man loudly shouts his name..

256
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,847
...then do you know what happens?

257
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,194
The hill replies
with his lover's name.

258
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,328
Wow! Really?

259
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,899
I'll try.

260
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,297
Please try.

261
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,658
Pawan!

262
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:44,697
Ritu.. Ritu!

263
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:48,377
Wow, Mr. Lodha!

264
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,438
Sorry.. see, I told you.

265
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,272
You're right.

266
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,413
Darling,
why don't you also try? Please.

267
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:57,612
Try, Mrs. Lodha.

268
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,356
Ritu!

269
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:05,088
Sahil.. Vikas.. Mohit..

270
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:10,998
Shekhan. Anil.. Ramesh.. Rohan..

271
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:15,596
Rakesh.. Sunil.. Moti..

272
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:19,904
- Manoj.. Sheela.. Sonia..
- Girls?

273
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:25,380
Pawan! Pawan!

274
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,411
- Pawan!
- Pawan?!

275
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:29,986
Kancha.

276
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,682
Hey Amol! Chotu!

277
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,382
Pappu"..

278
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:42,092
Garbage collector. Watchman..
Newspaper boy.. milkman..

279
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,965
Listen to me, Mr. Lodha.

280
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:56,571
Please save me, brother!
You're my friend.. I need a million.

281
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,739
I have to send my sister-in-law
to London for higher studies.

282
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,442
Please save me.

283
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:01,507
What is it? What are you staring at?

284
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:02,745
Is your mother getting married?
Get lost!

285
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,445
Bloody scoundrel! -Prem,
he's my customer. What are you doing?

286
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,716
Please save me.
Give me a million rupees.

287
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,120
Where do I bring a million from?

288
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,386
I'm just the manager of this hotel.
It doesn't belong to my father.

289
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,491
- Prem, you should be happy.
- Why?

290
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,623
You have a hot sister-in-law
at home to feast your eyes on.

291
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,667
- I have a bull in my house.
- Bull?

292
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,997
Yes, my brother-in-law.

293
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:28,573
He came down for two months to
participate in a wrestling competition.

294
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,580
He's been holed up in
my house for six months now.

295
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,980
- Have you seen the movie 'Judwa'?
- Yes, why?

296
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,574
It's the same problem, man.

297
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,713
My wife and my brother-in-law
are twins. Cross-connection.

298
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,949
When I touch my wife..

299
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,722
...my brother-in-law gets hot.

300
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,859
Oh.. no..

301
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,837
Ouch“
- Ouch!

302
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,888
What am I doing? Meet!

303
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:25,031
- Oh god!
- Leave my sister alone!

304
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:30,939
Meet, you mean to say that
your life is hell too? -Yes.

305
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,037
Wife's calling.

306
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:35,641
Hi, darling.

307
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,839
Honey, guess what?

308
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:38,812
What?

309
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,544
Brother has gone out to
chill with his friends tonight.

310
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,382
And he's out the entire night.

311
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,683
The line's clear. Come home quickly.

312
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,653
Oh baby, I'm coming!

313
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,253
- Prem..
- You got the one million?

314
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,988
No, my arrangements have been made.

315
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,087
You can sit here and
think about your withdrawal.

316
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,154
I'm going home to deposit.

317
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,496
To deposit.

318
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,127
Meet, you bloody cheat!

319
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,809
Oh baby, we've got
a chance after six months.

320
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,934
Your brother will party there..

321
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,311
...and we'll have fun
and frolic here all night.

322
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,379
Let's go wild, baby. Let's go wild.

323
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,390
You dog! How dare you mock my lisp!

324
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:42,444
Leave me! What are you doing?

325
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,382
Power slam!

326
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:03,165
Oh god, they're shattered!

327
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,795
I'm done for!

328
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,106
Baby“ baby“

329
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,977
Baby.. -I'm not fit
to give you a baby anymore.

330
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,174
I'm so sorry.

331
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,747
Gently, dude!

332
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,212
I'm doing it.

333
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,322
- It's gangrene.
- Gangrene?!

334
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,759
- We'll have to chop it off.
- Chop?!

335
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,625
- Prem, scissors.
- Yes, doctor.

336
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:09,597
- Here, doctor.
- What are you doing?

337
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,031
Solve his problem in one snipe.

338
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:13,461
- Prem, hold his hands.
- Yes, doctor.

339
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,472
No way! Nobody's chopping
anything, get it?

340
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:22,835
You guys are such rascals.
You're mocking my condition.

341
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:26,539
You went to deposit,
but returned with your account closed.

342
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:27,743
I asked you for a
million and you refused.

343
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,047
- You want a million?
- Yes.

344
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,780
- I'll give it.
- Really?

345
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:34,084
Yes, just sell my
mansion in Doodhwadi.

346
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,887
After a 99-year lease,
it's finally come to me.

347
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,427
Will you take another
hundred years to sell it?

348
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,520
No, I'll call up right away.

349
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,866
Hello, I'm Dalal speaking.

350
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:51,430
You.. Mr. Dalal, what happened
to the mansion at Doodhwadi?

351
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,009
Sir, I'm standing
outside your mansion.

352
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,104
But I don't know why
nobody's willing to come here.

353
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,145
But you don't worry.

354
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,583
I won't rest till I
generate some leads today.

355
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:03,947
Hurry up or..

356
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,184
Sir, the client is here.
I'll hang up now.

357
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,188
Welcome, sir.

358
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:12,527
Please come.

359
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,192
Welcome, sir.

360
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,702
This mansion is very
old and badly maintained.

361
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:27,709
Oh sir, this was a palace
for the kings in the olden days.

362
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,768
Just take a step in.

363
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:36,847
Come.. come, my darling.

364
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:42,682
Come inside, my dear.
Come in, just once.

365
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:46,791
Just once..

366
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,999
No, I don't feel like it.
Let's check out some other bungalow.

367
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,092
Sir.. listen to me, sir..

368
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,977
Can I get some tea! Tea please!

369
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:15,750
Nobody even asks me
for tea in this house.

370
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,320
Sir, your tea.

371
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:22,961
But who are you?

372
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:25,757
I'm your new maid, Shiney.

373
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,661
Nice name.

374
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,974
Here's some fritters
to go with the tea.

375
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:38,371
The aroma is nice.

376
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:45,516
Wow, the fritters are delicious.
You deserve a tip.

377
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:47,221
Here's fifty bucks. -No, sir..

378
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,020
C'mon, keep it.

379
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,690
The fritters are very nice.

380
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,324
I've never eaten such
fritters in my life.

381
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,596
Just a minute. Here..

382
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,964
- Hundred.. two.. keep this.
- No..

383
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,030
- Keep it.
- Thank you..

384
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,973
Such delicious fritters. wow!

385
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,975
Keep this. Take it.

386
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:21,619
What a.. fritter!

387
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:29,965
Enough, sir. My blouse will tear open.

388
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:31,761
Then let it tear.

389
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,981
What is this for, sir?

390
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:51,445
If your blouse tears,
you can use this to stitch it.

391
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:57,956
C'mon, sir.. had I known
that it's so easy to make money..

392
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,053
...then I'd have returned
from Doodwad earlier itself.

393
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,563
- Doodhwadi?
- Yes, my village.

394
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:05,600
Doodhwadi is my village too.

395
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,432
- Really?
- Yes.

396
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:11,099
Then it's my duty to serve you nicely.

397
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,435
Tell me, what all can I do for you?

398
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:30,726
Thank you for calling us over, buddy.

399
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,455
Enjoy the show, my friends.

400
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:17,371
"I floored you by wearing lipstick."

401
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:21,434
"I looked into your eyes,
it caused a heart attack."

402
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:25,838
"O darling.. O darling.."

403
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:30,551
"O darling.. O darling.."

404
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:34,852
"I floored you by wearing lipstick."

405
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:38,985
"I looked into your eyes,
it caused a heart attack."

406
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:43,696
"O darling.. O darling.."

407
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:47,702
"O darling.. O darling.."

408
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:09,716
"You look awesome and fashionable."

409
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:14,389
"You sculpt your figure in the gym,
only to kill us."

410
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:18,764
"Your booty like apples.
Your legs compliment them."

411
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:23,169
"Your lips are like candy,
I feel helpless."

412
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:27,574
"Come, it's a season of love.
There's no reason to abstain."

413
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:31,943
"Open up..
open the door to your heart."

414
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:36,348
"You're a hottie,
my desires are naughty."

415
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:41,015
"Come, let's get flirty.
Give in to your emotions."

416
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:45,424
"C'mon, my sexy lady,
let's make some love tonight."

417
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:49,556
"You've got me going crazy.
I wanna hold you tight."

418
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:53,933
"O darling.. O darling.."

419
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:58,235
"O darling.. O darling.."

420
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:02,403
"You floored me by wearing lipstick."

421
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:07,147
"You looked into my eyes,
it caused a heart attack."

422
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:11,517
"O darling.. O darling.."

423
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:15,854
"O darling.. O darling.."

424
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:19,952
"I floored you by wearing lipstick."

425
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:24,663
"I looked into your eyes,
it caused a heart attack."

426
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:29,034
"O darling.. O darling.."

427
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:33,371
"O darling.. O darling.."

428
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,075
"..by wearing lipstick."

429
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,676
"I floored you.."

430
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,660
Bloody Amar 'Sucking' Saxena!

431
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:04,869
Your mom-in-law screwed
up all our moods today.

432
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:08,069
She just screwed up the mood today.

433
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:11,375
Normally, she gangs up
with the guru and screws me.

434
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:16,942
And that guru presents
song verses as his teachings.

435
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:19,818
...and is making a fool out of my wife.

436
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:24,758
Be grateful that at least your
wife doesn't have a twin brother.

437
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:29,329
I plug one's phone and
the other's battery gets charged.

438
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:33,059
The common saying is that
the sister-in-law is half a wife.

439
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,033
In my case,
the brother-in-law is half a husband!

440
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,334
Don't talk about the sister-in-law.

441
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:41,501
My sister-in-law is not a bone in
the throat but a juicy steak herself.

442
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:46,604
When she was young, she'd
sit on the lap and eat a lollypop.

443
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:48,784
Now when she sits on the lap..

444
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,582
“My lolly pops out.

445
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:53,486
This is the first bed in the world..

446
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,889
...where my wife's
sister sleeps with us.

447
00:31:57,181 --> 00:32:01,152
Our condition is such
that forget the feast.

448
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:03,256
...we don't even get regular meals!

449
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:15,942
Friends, I have an idea.

450
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:21,515
I have a great, grand idea!

451
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:24,550
- No, no.
- Yes, yes.

452
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,452
- No, no.
- Yes, yes.

453
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,080
- No, no..
- Shut up!

454
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:33,093
We're going to enjoy
a feast this time.

455
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:37,057
This time we won't be playing
golf with downtown girls..

456
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:42,503
...but playing softball
with village belles instead!

457
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,966
Village? Which village?

458
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:47,038
Doodhwadi.

459
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,371
That's my native.

460
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,705
Why Doodhwadi?

461
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:56,008
Because in Doodhwadi, the
moment someone buys your bungalow..

462
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:59,984
...you can bid goodbye
to your mom-in-law's house.

463
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:03,617
We'll only sell his
bungalow at Doodhwadi.

464
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:08,829
How will we get to
relish a rural feast?

465
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:13,460
In Doodhwadi, there isn't just
one Shiney, but thousands of Shineys.

466
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:18,439
Smiling Shiney,
washing Shiney, bathing Shiney..

467
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,941
Toweling Shiney..

468
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:23,568
A Shiney here and a Shiney there!

469
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,272
- What do you think?
- Correct.

470
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:29,978
We'll get to enjoy in Doodhwadi on
the pretext of selling the bungalow.

471
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:33,750
Yes. And this time it
won't just be fun and frolic..

472
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:36,151
...but great fun and frolic!

473
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,456
Such great fun and frolic that
the world will be left wide-eyed.

474
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,397
- Wide-eyed!
- Wide-eyed!

475
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:46,833
So Doodhwadi, here we come.

476
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,204
- Doodhwadi?
- Yes.

477
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,672
It's your ancestral bungalow,
you go to sell it yourself.

478
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:28,467
It's your friend. You can go
and get pally in such a rotten place.

479
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,111
Is this Doodhwadi
even marked on the map?

480
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:36,843
I told you, whether we go to
Doodhwadi or up the donkey's rear..

481
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:39,046
...it won't make a
difference to our wives.

482
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,750
Yes, wives become
suspicious only when“

483
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,794
...we go to Bangkok for work.

484
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:47,487
Hey, look ahead!

485
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:00,574
- Are you alright?
- Yes, I am.

486
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:03,145
OK, step outside. Let's check the car.

487
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,582
- Open it.
- It's hot.

488
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,217
- Oh no, it's badly damaged.
- Shit!

489
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,847
That reminds me,
I want to shit urgently.

490
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,448
You want to shit in such a time!

491
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,823
- Go there, behind the rocks.
- Water..

492
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,020
What do we do now?

493
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:21,427
Water.

494
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,221
control.

495
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:37,811
Oh my god! Snake! Snake!

496
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,176
What happened?

497
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,613
Why are you screaming 'snake?

498
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:43,379
- A snake bit me on the butt.
- What?

499
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,251
The poison has already
started spreading. -Oh god!

500
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,051
I'm feeling giddy.

501
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,650
- I'm going to die.
- No, nothing will happen to you.

502
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,057
I'm there. We'll think of something.

503
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,721
There must surely
be a way to save you.

504
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,924
- There's one way.
- What?

505
00:35:57,021 --> 00:36:00,901
You both have to suck the
venom out of my butt. - What?!

506
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,598
Have you gone mad?
I'm not going to suck your butt.

507
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,870
The poison is taking effect.
The world is vanishing before my eyes.

508
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:09,240
Everything around me is darkening.

509
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,713
Remove your goggles,
the darkness will disappear.

510
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:16,980
For the sake of our friendship,
please suck on it.

511
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,748
Why did the snake have
to bite you on the butt!

512
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,983
Thank god the snake
bit him on the butt..

513
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:25,584
...think what you'd have to suck
on if it bit him on the front! -Oh no!

514
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,791
Goodbye, I'm going.

515
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,458
Wait, we'll suck on it.

516
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:32,660
- Meet, suck it.
- OK.

517
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:34,598
What? Why should I suck?

518
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:35,865
You're an expert at sucking.

519
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:38,806
Remember how you used
to suck your thumb as a kid.

520
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,201
You're no less of
an expert at sucking.

521
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,779
I've seen you suck out entire
mango and leave behind the seed.

522
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:47,509
Those were mangoes, but this
is a watermelon. C'mon, suck it.

523
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:51,543
People die laughing,
I'm going to die shitting.

524
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:53,111
Suck it, you rascals!

525
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:55,453
Yes, we'll suck it. Bend down.

526
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,091
I'll suck it.

527
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:07,231
You idiot,
you weren't bitten by a snake.

528
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,635
- A 'coctus' was stuck to your rear.
- Cactus.

529
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:10,968
Yes, cactus.

530
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,867
I've been saved!

531
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,535
You nearly died.

532
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,271
And I nearly sucked.

533
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,513
Hey, it's a wagon!

534
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:24,753
Wait! Wait!

535
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,484
Doodhwadi!

536
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:35,295
Thank you, sir.

537
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:38,932
Doodhwadi.
Let's milk this opportunity, guys.

538
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:54,014
- Village belles..
- Smooth like butter.

539
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,231
Look at that.

540
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,733
Beautiful pots.

541
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,037
Doodhwadi. Doodhwadi, I love you!

542
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,774
I love Doodhwadi. I love pottery.

543
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,349
I love pottery.
I love your beautiful pots.

544
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,051
Yoghurt!

545
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:39,927
WOW!

546
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:43,457
Creamy yoghurt!

547
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,933
Doodhwadi.

548
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,946
- Thank you, sir.
- Doodhwadi.

549
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,274
Guys, let's milk this opportunity.

550
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,056
- Village belles..
- Stale as bread.

551
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:18,896
What to do now?

552
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:31,009
Look at that.

553
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,583
Doodhwadi. I don't like Doodhwadi.

554
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,450
- A pot of gold in the dreams..
- Is shockingly old in reality.

555
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,046
Oh god, where have you brought us!

556
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,954
Even the yoghurt!

557
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,962
Drink some yoghurt, dear.

558
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:54,068
No way!

559
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,229
You drink, dear.

560
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:56,669
I don't want your yoghurt.

561
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:00,905
Every packet of milk
here has expired ages ago.

562
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:04,276
Forget the milk, even the
yoghurt here is a century old.

563
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,746
Is this your native
place or the Jurassic park?

564
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,579
Where are all the young girls?

565
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,209
I'll tell you!

566
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:19,253
All the young girls of the
village have gone to the city..

567
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:21,023
...to work as maids.

568
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,894
- What?!
- What?

569
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:25,099
Who are you?

570
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:28,603
I'm the chieftain
of this village, Ramsay.

571
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,831
What? Your name is Ramsay?

572
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,499
Yes. We were three brothers.

573
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:37,307
Ramsay brothers. Two went away..

574
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:39,005
...I'm the only one left, Ramsay.

575
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:41,174
How did your brothers die?

576
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:42,683
They haven't died!

577
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:46,879
They went to the city to work.

578
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:52,656
By the way, why have you
come to this barren, deserted..

579
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:56,357
...graveyard of a village? Why?

580
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,934
Brother Ramsay,
we've come here on some work too.

581
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,698
I want to sell my ancestral bungalow.

582
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,137
Which bungalow?

583
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:07,839
This one.

584
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:15,411
Satan's area! Old bungalow!

585
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:19,079
Terror! The chime of the anklets!

586
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,412
What's all this?

587
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,083
Titles of horror films.

588
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:27,919
But films are inspired by real life.

589
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:32,057
The mansion that you've
come to sell is haunted.

590
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,665
Amar, I think that,
just like your guru..

591
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,003
...this guy is also
making a fool out of us.

592
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:43,336
Ramsay, please explain in detail,
whatever it is you're harping about.

593
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,779
This story is about Ragini.

594
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:48,710
- MMS?
- No, SMS.

595
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:51,685
- SMS?
- Simple, marvelous and sexy.

596
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:55,619
Ragini's beauty was
the talk of the village.

597
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,126
Men wrote her letters in blood.

598
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:02,289
But to keep all the sinners
away from her daughter.

599
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,658
...her father stood
at the door of their house.

600
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:11,798
The posse of men ended
up waving their hands.

601
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:14,706
But the day of the
union never arrived.

602
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:17,575
Ragini suppressed
the hunger of her youth.

603
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:26,010
Poor Ragini,
quietly endured everything..

604
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:29,546
...because her father
had a long stick in his hand.

605
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:36,797
Neither did she get a cucumber,
nor did she play..

606
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,060
...hide and seek in the arms of a man.

607
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,394
I agree that it's a flashback,
but is the rhyming required?

608
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,404
This is a style of
narrating the story..

609
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:46,338
...without which
everything is just bland.

610
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,536
Don't irritate, come to the point!

611
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:54,639
The guys yearning for Ragini spread
false stories about lions attacking..

612
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:57,151
...but her father didn't budge.

613
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,949
- Then one day, really..
- The lion attacked?

614
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:02,149
No, a snake attacked.

615
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:06,058
But taking it to be a lie,
Ragini's father didn't come.

616
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:19,163
Daughter..

617
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,937
No... no..

618
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:30,319
This is where the
story should have ended.

619
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:34,412
But when she died,
Ragini's youth was yet to blossom.

620
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:37,925
Any man would do for her,
whatever be his faith or creed.

621
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:44,364
All that Ragini's soul
wants is a wedding night.

622
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:49,469
Guys, one shouldn't mock
at a dead person like this.

623
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:51,233
- What if the story turns out to be true?
- Shut up.

624
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:53,433
You coward! Ghost are not real.

625
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:56,041
Now I know why it was proving
hard to sell your mansion. -Yes.

626
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,306
It's due to these
baseless horror stories.

627
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:00,143
Come, let's ask
someone for directions.

628
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,615
Get lost, blanket-man!

629
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:03,878
Where are you going?

630
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:07,453
Don't go to Ragini's mansion.
Don't go!

631
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:50,788
Wow, Amar. This is quite big.

632
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:02,009
It's a cat, you coward!

633
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,644
Hey Meet, switch on the torch.
Let's find the switchboard.

634
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,081
Why aren't the lights turning on?

635
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,387
It's a village,
there must be a power cut.

636
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,190
Don't worry, come.

637
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:25,364
Even the torch isn't working now.

638
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:27,026
This torch is torturing us.

639
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:58,092
You've arrived.
You all have finally arrived.

640
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,533
I've been waiting for long.

641
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:03,832
For us?

642
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:05,333
For anyone..

643
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:09,501
...who'd enter this house.

644
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:13,948
So many years..

645
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:19,010
I've been waiting for so many years.

646
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:21,253
This is my house. Who are you?

647
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:24,121
I'm Shabri.

648
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,652
Shabri. Tell us, Shabri.

649
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:29,630
What do I tell you, sir?

650
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:35,697
An orphan like me makes
any available shelter her home.

651
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:39,539
My story is a very tragic one, sir.
Very tragic.

652
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:43,577
If you hear it, your eyes will water.

653
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:47,580
It's my mouth that is watering.

654
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:51,477
I lost my mother in childhood..

655
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:54,078
...and her burden fell on my chest.

656
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:57,916
In my youth, I lost my father.

657
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,827
Even the burden of his
responsibilities, fell on my chest.

658
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:05,262
You can't see, sir.

659
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:09,429
How much burden I carry on my chest!

660
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:12,431
Yes, we can see.

661
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:14,973
If you wish, we can even lift it.

662
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:16,540
Only if you wish.

663
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,578
What?

664
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,841
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

665
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,952
I had just taken refuge
here all these days.

666
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:27,816
If you permit,
shall I start working here?

667
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:29,013
Working?

668
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:32,322
Don't refuse, sir.
I'll do all your work.

669
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:35,226
I'll fulfill all
your needs and desires.

670
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:38,264
Not just my age,
even my sleep is tender.

671
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:41,435
Even if you call at midnight,
I'll come running.

672
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,671
I'll do what you say.

673
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:45,798
I'll do where you say.

674
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:48,206
I'll do it the way you say.

675
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,978
Enough, girl. Are you going
to take a promotion on joining day?

676
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:56,417
Your job's confirmed.

677
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:57,349
- Really?
- Yes.

678
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:59,978
I'll prepare a meal
for you all right away.

679
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:02,354
- And clean up the whole house.
- OK.

680
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:07,753
How could you appoint her like this?

681
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,695
We don't know whether
she's lying or not.

682
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:12,232
There should be some
reason to believe her.

683
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:17,295
There is.
Didn't you see the two big reasons?

684
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:21,935
And if god wants,
I'll show you the third reason soon.

685
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:24,980
Correct. So what if there's
no Shiney in the village?

686
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:26,571
We have a Shabri at home.

687
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:28,344
Yes!
'Yes!

688
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:30,145
But we are three.

689
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:33,453
May the best man win!

690
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:36,855
- May the best man win!
- May the best man win!

691
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:13,051
"Your love possesses me like a ghost."

692
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:16,962
"My heart is stuck on you,
like a bloody fool."

693
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:21,002
"It's been waiting
helplessly since long."

694
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:25,369
"You never meet,
despite all the promises."

695
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:29,707
"Where are you?
Where are you after prepping me up?"

696
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:39,078
"With a silk scarf around your neck,
come and meet me.."

697
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:45,722
"..I stand outside the club,
my eyes lined with kohl from Delhi."

698
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:49,397
"Silk scarf.."

699
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,832
"Move it.. let me do my thing."

700
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:05,135
"You're the hottest,
get on the floor."

701
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:07,237
"My heart is stuffed
with love for you."

702
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:09,250
"You're good luck
as well as good news."

703
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:13,118
"Don't misuse me, O miss.
I just want to say."

704
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:18,353
"O darling, why are you so hyper?
Step on the brakes of your heart."

705
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:21,225
"I just want to say.."

706
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:25,895
"Where are you?
Where are you after prepping me up?"

707
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:35,304
"With a silk scarf around your neck,
come and meet me.."

708
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:41,946
"..I stand outside the club,
my eyes lined with kohl from Delhi."

709
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:45,712
"Silk scarf.."

710
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,995
"Move it.. let me do my thing."

711
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:01,230
"You're the hottest,
get on the floor."

712
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:05,101
"How long will you keep me yearning,
trapped in your grip?"

713
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:09,666
"The poor lover is on tenterhooks,
I just want to say."

714
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:14,512
"O darling, I'm good and you're fine.
I'm yours and you're mine."

715
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,211
"I just want to say."

716
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:21,951
"Where are you?
Where are you after prepping me up?"

717
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:31,256
"With a silk scarf around your neck,
come and meet me.."

718
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:37,934
"..I stand outside the club,
my eyes lined with kohl from Delhi."

719
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:42,437
"Silk scarf.."

720
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:44,410
Stop, Amar! Where are you taking her?

721
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:49,512
Shabri, my patience is running out.

722
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:53,646
- Nab him!
- Wait!

723
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,957
- Amar, you coward!
- Amar, you coward!

724
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:58,492
- Open the door.
- Open the door.

725
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:01,488
Don't worry,
this loser won't take much time.

726
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:02,996
He's two-minute noodles.

727
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:04,963
Yes, he's 'quick-gun' Murugan.

728
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:07,934
Fire.. fire.. misfire!

729
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:11,770
See, your friends are getting worried.

730
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:16,137
Meet isn't worried for you,
but his medicines.

731
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:17,471
Medicines?

732
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:18,869
What's wrong with him?

733
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:20,778
He has a problem getting up.

734
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:23,916
Getting up? But his legs appear fine.

735
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:28,013
It's not about his legs,
but somewhere else.

736
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:31,990
Actually,
it's always 6.30 on his watch.

737
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:34,192
I didn't understand.

738
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:38,258
His gadget doesn't work.

739
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,028
Oh god, poor guy!

740
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:45,005
That guy is poorer.
he.. what's his name? -Who?

741
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:48,167
That fat guy with buck teeth,
who laughs in a weird manner.

742
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:49,642
That ugly fat thing.

743
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:51,779
- Prem?
- Yes, Prem.

744
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:55,716
He needs prayers along with his pills.

745
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:58,013
Why? What happened to him?

746
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:00,555
He's on his..

747
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:01,645
What?

748
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,317
...way out.

749
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:08,359
It's a venereal disease that even
Dr. Gupta couldn't cure.

750
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:09,692
Venereal disease?

751
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,561
Oh god, he even touched me.

752
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:16,035
Oh poor girl, this disease
doesn't spread by touching.

753
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:18,766
Only love spreads by touching.

754
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:23,575
But if you still want, I'll check you.

755
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:56,902
What the“

756
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:18,760
What happened to you?

757
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:22,527
I'll get some water for you.

758
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:30,067
Look, what happened to him?

759
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:32,113
Forget him, are you all right?

760
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:33,340
I'm fine, look at him.

761
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,848
We'll look at him later, first you.

762
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:36,747
Come.

763
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:38,217
Come soon.

764
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:46,421
You rascal, just five minutes
with Shabri and you're so heated up.

765
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:48,427
She's a very hot chick, man.

766
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:51,089
She shook him up so
bad that he's still shaking.

767
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,665
You vibrator!

768
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:55,859
She's here.

769
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,267
Here, drink some water.

770
00:54:57,994 --> 00:54:59,200
What's the matter? Take the glass.

771
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:00,970
You take your medicines too.

772
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,009
Medicines?

773
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:05,803
Shabri, it's Amar who is ill, not me.

774
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:07,640
No need to hide.

775
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:10,348
Amar told me everything.

776
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,717
Your clock is always stuck at 6.30.

777
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:19,591
That's a lie! You liar!

778
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:21,754
He's lying.

779
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:23,290
I'm He-man.

780
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:26,334
Ask Prem if you don't believe me.

781
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:29,836
Meet, now that Shabri has found out,
why deny it?

782
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:31,166
Tell her that you're impotent.

783
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:34,203
Rascal, you turned
out to be a liar too.

784
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:37,074
You rascals,
have some respect for our friendship.

785
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:38,976
- Meet, shut up.
- OK.

786
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:43,115
Shabri, did this guy
say anything about my clock?

787
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,883
No.

788
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:48,286
I knew that there can't
be a truer friend than him.

789
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,825
But he told me about
your venereal disease.

790
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:53,451
With a friend like him,
who needs enemies!

791
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,188
I don't have any venereal disease.

792
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:57,492
And neither is it 6.30 on my clock.

793
00:55:58,154 --> 00:56:02,830
The truth is that the needle
on his clock is very tiny.

794
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:06,772
Yes. And I've seen him stuff
socks in his underwear many times.

795
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:08,465
- Really?
- Yes.

796
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:10,269
- What?
- Yes.

797
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,047
Actually, I've grown only
vertically since 2nd grade.

798
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:15,105
Not horizontally.

799
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,352
I agree friends that
it's difficult to believe.

800
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:22,184
But check the mirror once
and you'll know the truth.

801
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:23,086
Let go.

802
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,987
Forget the mirror, let me measure.

803
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:50,577
Thank you, Amar, for opening my eyes.

804
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:53,620
I agree,
I suffer from a venereal disease.

805
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:56,953
Not just me, my whole family
suffers from a venereal disease.

806
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:01,662
Meet, listen to us.
Look at the mirror.

807
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:04,756
- Prem, shut up.
- No kidding.

808
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,400
I look at the mirror everyday.

809
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:10,631
Shabri, as far as
manliness is concerned..

810
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:13,398
...the truth is that
there's no greater..

811
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:20,773
<i>Nu greater“.</i>

812
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:26,983
<i>No greater“ no greater“.</i>

813
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:28,282
'No greater' what?

814
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,554
No greater wuss than me.

815
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:35,585
It's always 6.30 on my clock.

816
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:41,135
Friends, when all our
truths has been exposed..

817
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:44,604
...then why not go out for a walk?

818
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:47,904
Shabri, just coming.

819
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,271
- Aren't you coming, Meet?
- Coming.

820
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:54,310
"Silk scarf.."

821
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:05,724
Neither do you have any problems,
nor am I Shabri.

822
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:10,063
Because my name is Ragini.

823
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,230
Run!

824
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:23,475
I've waited for 50 years.

825
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:25,843
My time has finally come!

826
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:29,907
Run!

827
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:48,363
Come, dearie.. let's have fun.

828
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:04,284
Come, let's have a grand time.

829
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:11,091
Open up.. open up..

830
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:30,803
No, let's have great fun and frolic.

831
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:42,453
Run for your lives!

832
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:15,683
Without fulfilling my desires.

833
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:19,223
...if any of you tries
to flee from here..

834
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:22,160
...then you'll keep
getting such shocks.

835
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:25,798
You've come here of your own will..

836
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:29,732
...but you'll go when I will.

837
01:00:30,493 --> 01:00:33,906
The one among the three
of you who has fun with me..

838
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:37,342
...will have to die
and go to heaven with me.

839
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:46,713
Without which, neither will I find
salvation, nor will you get freedom.

840
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:53,057
The cheap oranges have proven costly.

841
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:55,896
Now only our ashes
will leave this place.

842
01:00:55,985 --> 01:01:00,434
Serves us right for wanting
to have great, grand fun!

843
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:28,655
This ghost won't let the
three of us leave this place alive.

844
01:01:29,218 --> 01:01:32,097
One of us will have to sacrifice
himself and sleep with her.

845
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,336
On one hand, it's my life.

846
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:37,834
On the other hand, it's those two.

847
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:40,904
My friends, my brothers.

848
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:43,906
The decision is very simple.

849
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:45,507
Let them die.

850
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,034
It's working.

851
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:17,772
Prem, have this.

852
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:21,345
I prepared your favorite yoghurt.

853
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:24,111
Who knows if there's a tomorrow!

854
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:26,787
Don't say such things, pal.
Don't lose hope.

855
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:28,478
We'll surely find a way out.

856
01:02:28,678 --> 01:02:29,884
What if we don't?

857
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:32,290
- Then we have sandwiches.
- Sandwich?

858
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:34,152
- I mean..
- Sit.

859
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:36,157
How can we think on an empty stomach?

860
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:38,324
Just like how you prepared
our favorite yoghurt.

861
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:40,663
I prepared your favorite sandwiches.

862
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,066
- Your sandwich?
- I ate mine.

863
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:44,467
- Your yoghurt?
- I drank it long back.

864
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:47,230
- Eat.
- Drink.

865
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:51,270
Wow, friends!
Since you both were working so hard..

866
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,277
...how could I stay behind?

867
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:56,048
I prepared your
favorite sweet pudding.

868
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:58,448
People eat sweets in celebration“

869
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:00,348
...we'll eat it in grief.

870
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:03,715
- Your bowl?
- I don't eat sweets.

871
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,153
You both know it.

872
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:08,259
Eat it.

873
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:10,257
Drink. -Eat.

874
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:12,489
Drink. -Eat.

875
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:16,503
Nice, eh?

876
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:20,999
How is the pudding?

877
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:23,065
- Liked it?
- Yes.

878
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:24,504
Eat it all.

879
01:03:36,779 --> 01:03:39,453
Wow, Amar! The yoghurt is amazing.

880
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,537
Rascal, what did
you mix in the yoghurt?

881
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:03,613
- Viagra.
- What?!

882
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:09,148
Sorry, friends, actually I
had to stoop down to make you rise.

883
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:11,851
Scoundrel, you're not
the only one who stooped low..

884
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:13,689
...and we're not the
only ones who have risen.

885
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:14,454
Meaning?

886
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:18,225
Meaning, there was Viagra in the
sandwich too, not just the yoghurt.

887
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:20,531
What?!

888
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,437
And even the pudding.

889
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:27,399
What?!

890
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,514
Damn!

891
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:41,879
Hurry UP-

892
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:44,549
Quietly. Not a word.

893
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:18,285
"Baby, come to me.
The night is young."

894
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:25,094
"Why don't you love me more?
Where do you go?"

895
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:30,531
"I'll show you a good time,
take you to heaven."

896
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:33,039
"In life, you need to take risks."

897
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:40,672
"I want your love..
your love.. your love, O beloved!"

898
01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:48,985
"I want your love..
your love.. your love, O beloved!"

899
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:53,786
"I want your.."

900
01:05:55,918 --> 01:05:57,556
"I want your.."

901
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:08,471
"Don't go away. Come to me, O dear."

902
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:12,273
"Only worry,
your body yearns and so does my soul."

903
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:16,079
"My soul yearns."

904
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:19,882
"My soul yearns."

905
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:23,719
"Don't go away. Come to me, O dear."

906
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:27,522
"Only worry,
your body yearns and so does my soul."

907
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:31,355
"I won't let go today.
I'll revel in the chill."

908
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,895
"I won't let any of your tricks work."

909
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:41,602
"I want your love..
your love.. your love, O beloved!"

910
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:49,742
"I want your love..
your love.. your love, O beloved!"

911
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:09,363
"I tore up the calendar
that kept a count of your wait."

912
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:13,201
"Shower me with your love now,
O darling!"

913
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:17,007
"Shower me with your love."

914
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:20,845
"Shower me with your love."

915
01:07:20,903 --> 01:07:24,646
"I tore up the calendar
that kept a count of your wait."

916
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:28,450
"Shower me with your love now,
O darling!"

917
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:32,557
"Two is better than one,
three is better than two."

918
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:34,787
"Come, let's fall in love."

919
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,795
"I want your.."

920
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:46,297
"I want your love..
your love.. your love, O beloved!"

921
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:54,440
"I want your love..
your love.. your love, O beloved!"

922
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:58,012
Oh damn! We're dead!

923
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:00,918
How do we escape the
effects of the Viagra?

924
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:04,823
Think of something bad. Something
disgusting, distasteful. -OK.

925
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,019
Disgusting? Just a minute.

926
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:11,289
What?

927
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:14,300
You rascal, you're looking at your
mom-in-law's photo in this condition!

928
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:15,801
Disgusting.. disgusting!

929
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:20,033
Even my breath goes limp in
front of her, the pole is nothing.

930
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:34,679
It worked!

931
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:36,918
I too have an idea.

932
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:53,538
It worked for you too!

933
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:57,839
Hey, I also have an idea.

934
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:23,359
That was a bad idea.

935
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:27,236
Careful, man!

936
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,103
Wow, buddy!

937
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:05,839
I saw a piano being played
with a flute for the first time. -Yes.

938
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:09,041
Hariprasad Chaurasia meets Beethoven.

939
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:11,013
Do you know any other songs?

940
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:45,752
Prem, is everything fine?

941
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:49,281
You're upset as if
you broke something.

942
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:51,151
Here, bandage it.

943
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:54,723
Bandage? It's totally bent out here!

944
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:06,429
I'm following you around like crazy..

945
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:08,734
...and you guys are hiding from me!

946
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:12,110
Ragini, I was ready for fun.

947
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:15,273
But what to do, I'm slightly injured.

948
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:17,874
My stomach is upset.

949
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,715
My mind is upset.

950
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:21,115
I mean, a headache.

951
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:23,122
Stop making excuses.

952
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:25,985
You don't know about my powers.

953
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:34,231
Had I wanted, I could have
made you do anything. Anything.

954
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:39,034
But it's not fun if it's forced.

955
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:43,699
Moreover,
you'll have to fulfill my wish.

956
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:45,034
Or else..

957
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:46,741
I'm ready.

958
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:48,314
Really?

959
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:50,908
Have you gone mad, Prem?

960
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,680
If you do something with her..

961
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:54,379
Life isn't great anyway.

962
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:58,355
There can't be a more beautiful
way to commit suicide.

963
01:11:58,414 --> 01:11:59,620
I'm ready, ma'am.

964
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:01,192
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

965
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:04,730
Tonight at 9 pm,
wait for me in your room.

966
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:07,165
Just a minute.

967
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:11,794
Hold your tongue until then
and give me time for recovery.

968
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:13,430
Really? I understood.

969
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:15,506
We'll meet directly at night.

970
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:22,440
Prem, my friend.. my brother.

971
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:24,745
We'll miss you after
returning to Mumbai, buddy.

972
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,649
- Meet, let's pack our bags.
- Yes.

973
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:29,246
Just a minute,
let's take a photo of his. -Why?

974
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:32,492
- We'll need it for Prem's photo frame.
- Shut up.

975
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:35,191
I'm not going to do
anything with her. -What?

976
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:36,191
Then why did you commit to her?

977
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:38,788
What was the need to take
a stray arrow on your butt?

978
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:40,127
Shut up.

979
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:48,206
- Friends, I have an idea.
- Oh no!

980
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:56,981
Babu Rangeela.

981
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:03,222
Very loose in character.

982
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:09,488
The gigolo of the village.

983
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:17,628
Male prostitute.

984
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:18,761
Male prostitute?

985
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:21,706
Yes. Even if there has to
be a sacrifice, it need not be us.

986
01:13:22,698 --> 01:13:25,577
He charges 5000 for each visit.

987
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:27,907
I offered him 50,000.

988
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:29,107
50,000?

989
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:30,544
We don't have to pay him anyway.

990
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:32,915
Once he does it, he's gone.

991
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:35,552
Prem, you're a genius.

992
01:13:35,644 --> 01:13:36,520
Hi, guys!

993
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:42,588
Myself, Babu Rangeela.

994
01:13:45,988 --> 01:13:48,229
This guy? Can he do it?

995
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:51,998
Hey! Don't underestimate
Babu Rangeela.

996
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,400
My clientele is spread far and wide.

997
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:56,733
Look at this item.

998
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:04,111
Deepika?

999
01:14:07,342 --> 01:14:08,480
Katrina!

1000
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:13,956
Sunny Leone.

1001
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:19,798
Sunny Deal?!

1002
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:25,701
Actually,
I showed you the wrong album.

1003
01:14:26,495 --> 01:14:28,771
I'm a fan of these people.

1004
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:31,835
- I'll show you the client album.
- It's 0k, let it be.

1005
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,676
Look, there's no dearth of money.

1006
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:37,546
But come what may,
don't change your mind.

1007
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:46,021
Once I commit,
he doesn't listen to me either.

1008
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,852
Wow, that's great!

1009
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:52,223
Sir, please wait inside.
She'll be there in a moment.

1010
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:55,095
Hurry up, I don't have time.

1011
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,504
This fish took the bait.
Come, let's pack our bags. -Yes.

1012
01:15:00,596 --> 01:15:04,009
- Surprise!
- Hi, baby!

1013
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:11,578
Just when we got rid of one witch,
three more have arrived!

1014
01:15:12,307 --> 01:15:14,913
- Darling..
- Darling..

1015
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:17,414
What a pleasant surprise!

1016
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:19,288
How come you're here?

1017
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:21,487
You must be tired. Sit down.

1018
01:15:21,783 --> 01:15:22,989
Come, sit.

1019
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:26,492
Did you three think
why we've come here?

1020
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:28,224
Why have you come here?

1021
01:15:28,323 --> 01:15:29,927
It's 'Karva Chauth'
(FESTIVAL) tomorrow.

1022
01:15:29,992 --> 01:15:33,235
So we wanted to surprise
the three of you.

1023
01:15:33,629 --> 01:15:36,075
Karva Chauth. How sweet!

1024
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:39,441
We can't stay away
from you on such days.

1025
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:43,645
Hello! How much longer
will you make me wait?

1026
01:15:46,408 --> 01:15:47,352
Who is he?

1027
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:49,649
- Who is he?
- Who is he? Tell them.

1028
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:52,123
He's come to buy the mansion.

1029
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:54,717
Oh, he's come to buy the mansion.

1030
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:56,820
These three can't be relied upon.

1031
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:00,032
If this mansion has to be sold,
then we only have to do something.

1032
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:01,260
Come.

1033
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:03,167
Listen to me.

1034
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:04,934
- Hello.
- Hello.

1035
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:05,733
Are you an agent?

1036
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:09,435
Hey! I'm not an agent,
you can say 'customer' instead.

1037
01:16:09,531 --> 01:16:13,172
Oh.. OK, look,
the structure is in front of you.

1038
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:14,839
Tell me, how do you like it?

1039
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:23,418
I loved it.

1040
01:16:23,478 --> 01:16:25,082
I'm ready, come.

1041
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:26,888
Really? Then shall
we discuss the money?

1042
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:28,292
They've already discussed that.

1043
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:30,261
The deal has been finalized at Rs.
50,000. Come.

1044
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:32,931
50,000? Have you lost your mind?

1045
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:36,094
It should at least be 50 million.

1046
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:37,102
50 million?!

1047
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:38,695
Look at his face.

1048
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:41,240
- Even 60 million is not much for him.
- Absolutely.

1049
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:44,834
60 millions!

1050
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:50,047
60 millions! Nobody in my
family has ever earned that much.

1051
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:56,580
Sir, are you fine?

1052
01:16:56,678 --> 01:16:59,284
- Sir..
- 60 million!

1053
01:16:59,848 --> 01:17:01,020
What has happened to him?

1054
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:03,495
Didn't you hear? His whole
family hasn't earned that much.

1055
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:05,896
These beggars just drop
by to check out the house.

1056
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:07,900
Baby, let him be.
Why don't you go and freshen up?

1057
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:09,765
Yes, we'll take care of him.

1058
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:10,928
OK? Go on.

1059
01:17:10,993 --> 01:17:13,337
He wasted so much of our time.
Let's go.

1060
01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:15,174
Yes, go.

1061
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:17,572
What about him?

1062
01:17:56,705 --> 01:17:57,809
Betrayal!

1063
01:17:59,374 --> 01:18:00,910
You betrayed me!

1064
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:05,521
You promised to have fun with me
and called your wives over instead.

1065
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:07,888
No, we didn't call them.

1066
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:10,293
- He.. he brought them here.
- Yes.

1067
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:11,456
He's the bone in the throat.

1068
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,500
He brought them here
so that we couldn't have fun.

1069
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:17,765
You don't worry, I'll punish him
when he regains his senses.

1070
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:22,072
You don't have to do
all that with me around.

1071
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:32,246
Do you guys really
want to have fun with me?

1072
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:35,718
Are you saying this out of fear?

1073
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:38,917
No, true lust knows no fear!

1074
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:40,721
Really? Then come.

1075
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:47,226
No?

1076
01:18:47,322 --> 01:18:51,429
No, I mean.. won't it be
awkward with the wives around?

1077
01:18:51,526 --> 01:18:56,600
If we three can't have fun,
then how can you have fun?

1078
01:18:56,665 --> 01:18:58,667
Once they leave, we'll do as you wish.

1079
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:00,804
Until then,
you'll have to wait a little.

1080
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:05,343
Don't worry.

1081
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:08,248
I won't have to wait for long.

1082
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:13,615
Friends, let's do one thing.

1083
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:16,629
Let's tell our wives that
there's a ghost here. -Yes.

1084
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:20,394
Yes.. and also tell them..

1085
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:22,765
...that we wanted to have
a good time with that ghost.

1086
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:26,465
Now that ghost wants to have
a great and grand time with us.

1087
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:29,998
Oh god, I'm tired of this problem.

1088
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:33,137
- Tired?
- Yes, don't trouble me.

1089
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:46,049
Here, the three of us have prepared
a tasty meal for the two of you.

1090
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:49,256
Eat it.

1091
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:51,826
Yes, we will.

1092
01:19:56,858 --> 01:19:59,498
What are you staring at? Dig in!

1093
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:04,868
Oh.. now even they're
asking you to dig in.

1094
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:12,476
Don't worry, darlings.
Neither can they see me, nor hear me.

1095
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:15,816
How can you all resist it?

1096
01:20:15,877 --> 01:20:17,550
It looks so tempting.

1097
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:22,160
These guys aren't going to
eat vegetarian when there's chicken.

1098
01:20:23,385 --> 01:20:24,864
Where did you get this chicken from?

1099
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:28,527
It was loitering in the balcony,
we caught and slaughtered it.

1100
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:30,526
Babu!

1101
01:20:31,726 --> 01:20:35,139
Rangeela. The rascal deserved it.

1102
01:20:36,064 --> 01:20:38,601
Look, eat what you want.

1103
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:41,980
But the breast piece
is for my husband.

1104
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:43,810
It's his favorite.

1105
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:45,611
- Is it?
- Oh!

1106
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:47,318
Favorite?

1107
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:51,948
Darling,
why didn't you tell me earlier?

1108
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:06,531
Don't eat if you don't want to,
at least don't make faces.

1109
01:21:09,264 --> 01:21:10,402
OK, forget it.

1110
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:13,135
Meet loves the leg piece.

1111
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:15,772
Come what may, he never skips it.

1112
01:21:17,772 --> 01:21:18,978
Don't leave it today either.

1113
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,453
Stop. Stop. Please stop.

1114
01:21:28,516 --> 01:21:35,263
Don't stop. Don't stop.

1115
01:21:35,323 --> 01:21:37,030
Nobody is forcing you.

1116
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:39,568
You too can leave it if you want.

1117
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:40,663
Leave it.

1118
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:42,341
Please.

1119
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:45,570
OK, no problem.
Amar will eat the chicken.

1120
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:47,580
- No, I don't want to each chicken.
- Why?

1121
01:21:47,769 --> 01:21:49,612
It's Saturday today.

1122
01:21:49,671 --> 01:21:52,242
- Yes.
- I'll eat the noodles.

1123
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:18,608
Oh, chew with your mouth closed.

1124
01:22:22,137 --> 01:22:23,639
What's wrong with the three of you?

1125
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:27,045
We prepared the meal so lovingly
and you three are misbehaving.

1126
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:30,317
Damn disgusting! Let's go from here.

1127
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:31,720
Yes, let's go.

1128
01:22:31,813 --> 01:22:33,850
- Rekha..
- Nisha.. Listen to me, Nisha.

1129
01:22:33,915 --> 01:22:35,360
- Actually..
- I don't want to hear anything.

1130
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:36,929
- Shut up!
- Listen to me.

1131
01:22:36,985 --> 01:22:38,328
Nisha..

1132
01:22:39,154 --> 01:22:40,997
First you insulted our food.

1133
01:22:41,089 --> 01:22:43,000
Who knows what else you'll do now!

1134
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:52,840
Nisha, you beauty,
I can't resist your booty.

1135
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:58,248
Sorry, I didn't..

1136
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:02,783
Rascal, how dare you
molest your friend's wife!

1137
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:07,253
I can't even think like
this about my friend's wife.

1138
01:23:09,584 --> 01:23:11,461
Rekha, time for some fun.

1139
01:23:14,422 --> 01:23:18,928
You! He's outraging my modesty
and you're doing nothing about it.

1140
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:24,033
Hey! You rascal, how dare
you molest your friend's wife!

1141
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:27,045
Darling.. Hey dearie..

1142
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:34,483
I told you to save my modesty,
not outrage her.

1143
01:23:34,576 --> 01:23:37,750
Sapna, why cover up?
Get a taste of Meet too.

1144
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:44,795
You rascal, I couldn't
imagine that you'd stoop so low.

1145
01:23:47,155 --> 01:23:48,395
Get lost!

1146
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:50,736
Sorry, baby.

1147
01:23:50,892 --> 01:23:52,838
Even I couldn't imagine
that you all would stoop so low.

1148
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:55,134
We're not going to
stay here a moment longer.

1149
01:23:55,930 --> 01:23:58,410
Get out! C'mon, let's go from here.

1150
01:23:59,968 --> 01:24:02,539
Baby.. listen to me..
there's some misunderstanding“

1151
01:24:02,604 --> 01:24:03,844
Listen to me, Rekha!

1152
01:24:03,938 --> 01:24:04,780
- Nisha!
- Rekha!

1153
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:05,874
Sapna!

1154
01:24:06,274 --> 01:24:08,777
Please believe us, dear.
We don't know how this is happening.

1155
01:24:08,843 --> 01:24:10,481
We always wanted to..

1156
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:12,683
...outrage your modesty!

1157
01:24:16,818 --> 01:24:18,889
Baby, don't go.

1158
01:24:18,953 --> 01:24:20,523
If you stop, I'll hack off your legs.

1159
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:22,934
Oh god!

1160
01:24:23,258 --> 01:24:24,259
Listen to me, dear.

1161
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:27,502
Or I'll stick a broom on your butt.

1162
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:29,166
You'll dance like a peacock
for the rest of your life.

1163
01:24:30,799 --> 01:24:33,973
Hey Raju, get the broom!
Get the broom!

1164
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:34,843
Broom?

1165
01:24:34,936 --> 01:24:37,712
These guys have gone mad.
Let's run from here, c'mon.

1166
01:24:38,807 --> 01:24:40,047
Baby.. wait..

1167
01:24:40,108 --> 01:24:42,452
"Silk scarf.."

1168
01:24:43,478 --> 01:24:45,480
Ragini, were you doing all this?

1169
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:50,394
I told you,
you wouldn't have to wait for long.

1170
01:24:51,553 --> 01:24:53,123
Baby! Wait up!

1171
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:56,966
Darling..
careful, the gates are electrified.

1172
01:25:01,696 --> 01:25:02,572
No?
'No!

1173
01:25:02,664 --> 01:25:04,507
Run!

1174
01:25:04,566 --> 01:25:07,103
The gates aren't electrified.

1175
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:37,070
What type of current
is this that hits only us?

1176
01:25:56,084 --> 01:25:57,927
Is this is a house or a circus?!

1177
01:25:59,721 --> 01:26:01,894
What have you been up to,
you good-for-nothing!

1178
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:03,298
It's a circus, mom.

1179
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:06,430
They were misbehaving
with us while we were here.

1180
01:26:06,694 --> 01:26:10,335
After we left,
they got busy with each other.

1181
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,577
What are you doing?
Why are you holding my hand?

1182
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:14,113
- All of you?
- Here?

1183
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:15,113
Very bad, Prem.

1184
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,616
All of us came to give you a surprise.

1185
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:20,619
I thought that all of us
would holiday together as a family.

1186
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:22,746
Yes, then we met sister on the way.

1187
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:25,222
She told us about your antics.

1188
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,783
Now you've seen
everything for yourself.

1189
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:30,429
There's no need for
us to stay here now.

1190
01:26:30,485 --> 01:26:31,862
- Come.
- Wait.

1191
01:26:32,887 --> 01:26:34,560
Nobody is going anywhere.

1192
01:26:35,089 --> 01:26:36,500
It's quite late.

1193
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:38,268
We're all staying here.

1194
01:26:38,326 --> 01:26:40,033
- But mom..
- Don't worry.

1195
01:26:40,328 --> 01:26:41,830
I'll keep an eye on them.

1196
01:26:41,996 --> 01:26:43,873
All the men will sleep in one room.

1197
01:26:43,965 --> 01:26:45,808
All the women will sleep in another.

1198
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:50,477
If any of you misbehaves..

1199
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:53,810
...I'll break your legs!

1200
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:55,854
C'mon!

1201
01:27:03,818 --> 01:27:05,593
What bad luck!

1202
01:27:05,653 --> 01:27:07,030
First, it was just our wives.

1203
01:27:07,088 --> 01:27:09,034
- Now, even the relatives are here.
- Yes.

1204
01:27:09,457 --> 01:27:12,301
Who knows when we'll come together.

1205
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:16,467
Shut up!
You three have fooled me enough.

1206
01:27:17,999 --> 01:27:19,637
To hell with the fun!

1207
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:23,312
Now it's going to be forced.

1208
01:27:25,106 --> 01:27:29,179
Prem, come here.

1209
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:33,425
What if I possess your sister-in-law?

1210
01:27:35,617 --> 01:27:37,221
Prem..

1211
01:27:37,285 --> 01:27:44,203
...what if sister sees
us getting hanky-panky?

1212
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:47,330
No.. no.. no hanky-panky!

1213
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,743
Amar, come here.

1214
01:27:54,869 --> 01:27:58,282
What if I possess your mom-in-law?

1215
01:28:02,644 --> 01:28:09,619
I'll relive my youth on this pretext,
darling. -No.

1216
01:28:13,488 --> 01:28:18,233
Meet, what if I possess
your brother-in-law?

1217
01:28:20,328 --> 01:28:21,363
Lakshman!

1218
01:28:23,998 --> 01:28:29,448
Then it'll rip you apart.

1219
01:28:30,872 --> 01:28:32,215
- No!
- Yes.

1220
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:33,615
<i>N“, no!</i>

1221
01:28:41,582 --> 01:28:44,426
Oh man, what is this!

1222
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:58,941
You got scared!

1223
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,809
Not just scared, I freaked out.

1224
01:29:00,902 --> 01:29:02,973
Not just him, all of us freaked out.

1225
01:29:03,304 --> 01:29:04,180
What is it?

1226
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:06,912
Your friend's brother-in-law's photos.

1227
01:29:06,974 --> 01:29:10,421
If he pins down a man,
he wears him out.

1228
01:29:10,478 --> 01:29:12,549
Look at how he grips from the front!

1229
01:29:12,613 --> 01:29:14,251
- Grips what?
- See this.

1230
01:29:17,218 --> 01:29:20,427
His bear hug is beyond comparison.

1231
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:23,696
That's bad.

1232
01:29:23,758 --> 01:29:27,467
If he locks them in his thighs, even
the strongest would fall. See this.

1233
01:29:30,164 --> 01:29:31,609
Rip YOU apart!

1234
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:32,609
Meet!

1235
01:29:33,935 --> 01:29:36,313
It's time to go to sleep.

1236
01:29:37,472 --> 01:29:40,385
We'll hug tightly and sleep.
It'll be great fun.

1237
01:29:40,441 --> 01:29:43,251
- I need to pee.
- I'll join you.

1238
01:29:43,311 --> 01:29:45,257
- We'll do it together.
- Get lost!

1239
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:46,722
Meet!

1240
01:29:46,814 --> 01:29:49,818
Ragini.. where are you?

1241
01:29:49,884 --> 01:29:52,364
You've won, I've lost. Ragini!

1242
01:29:52,453 --> 01:29:55,332
"Silk scarf.."

1243
01:29:56,424 --> 01:30:01,965
"..tied around the neck.."

1244
01:30:02,029 --> 01:30:05,169
Oh shit! Ragini is
inside Amar's mom-in-law.

1245
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:07,235
No, I won't be able to do it.

1246
01:30:10,638 --> 01:30:13,881
Meet, climb up the gallows
or Lakshman will climb on you.

1247
01:30:17,945 --> 01:30:19,390
What are you doing here?

1248
01:30:19,447 --> 01:30:20,551
I'm ready to do it.

1249
01:30:20,615 --> 01:30:21,650
What?

1250
01:30:21,816 --> 01:30:23,557
That which you always wanted.

1251
01:30:23,718 --> 01:30:26,460
What are you doing?!
You're stripping in front of me!

1252
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:29,798
You're getting naked!
What are you doing?!

1253
01:30:29,891 --> 01:30:31,893
I'm getting ready to make love.

1254
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:34,039
Look, I don't have much time.
Take your clothes off quickly.

1255
01:30:34,128 --> 01:30:34,970
- What?!
- Yes.

1256
01:30:35,029 --> 01:30:36,531
- Come here, don't irritate.
- Hey“

1257
01:30:36,597 --> 01:30:38,406
- Hey.. save me!
- Don't confuse me.

1258
01:30:38,466 --> 01:30:40,446
- Don't waste time.
- Save me!

1259
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:41,411
Meet!

1260
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:46,443
Good that you came,
see what this fool is doing to me.

1261
01:30:46,674 --> 01:30:48,312
- There's no need to say anything.
- OK.

1262
01:30:48,409 --> 01:30:50,685
His fallen pants reveal everything.

1263
01:30:50,845 --> 01:30:53,849
Wow, Meet!
After seeing your actions today..

1264
01:30:54,115 --> 01:30:56,823
...my respect for you has increased.

1265
01:30:57,351 --> 01:30:58,728
Respect has increased?

1266
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:02,895
Meet, this was my idea,
so I'll implement it.

1267
01:31:03,691 --> 01:31:04,692
No, Prem..

1268
01:31:04,759 --> 01:31:06,761
- ...don't take off your clothes.
- What's wrong with both of you!

1269
01:31:06,861 --> 01:31:09,307
- I'm there. I've taken off my clothes.
- What do you mean?

1270
01:31:09,363 --> 01:31:11,240
I'm doing it, Prem.
What are you doing?

1271
01:31:11,399 --> 01:31:13,504
- C'mon, take me.
- What?

1272
01:31:13,568 --> 01:31:17,106
No, Prem. You have a wife,
a sister-in-law, take care of them.

1273
01:31:17,205 --> 01:31:18,275
I'll take care of her.

1274
01:31:18,339 --> 01:31:20,546
No, Meet. I'll take care of her.

1275
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:22,985
- No, Prem, I'll do it.
- No, Meet, I'll do it.

1276
01:31:23,077 --> 01:31:24,283
No, Prem..

1277
01:31:24,345 --> 01:31:27,224
- No, Meet..
- God, save me from these horny men!

1278
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:28,316
Shut up.

1279
01:31:28,382 --> 01:31:30,794
Now when we both are ready,
you're acting pricey.

1280
01:31:31,018 --> 01:31:32,929
Now you tell me, whom do you want?

1281
01:31:32,987 --> 01:31:35,194
Amar! Amar!

1282
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:37,532
- Oh, so she wants Amar.
- Amar?

1283
01:31:37,725 --> 01:31:39,466
- Amar!
- Amar!

1284
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,506
- Amar!
- Amar!

1285
01:31:41,596 --> 01:31:44,236
- Amar!
- Amar!

1286
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:47,038
I'm here.

1287
01:31:47,101 --> 01:31:51,675
Amar, see what your rogue
friends are doing with me.

1288
01:31:51,739 --> 01:31:53,082
I've understood everything.

1289
01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:56,945
I could never imagine that
you both would think like this.

1290
01:31:57,211 --> 01:31:59,350
I'm don't regret that
you thought like this..

1291
01:31:59,614 --> 01:32:03,585
...but I regret not thinking
about it before you.

1292
01:32:06,654 --> 01:32:10,124
Hey oldie!
Stop shouting and get in the bed.

1293
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:11,898
Have you lost it!

1294
01:32:11,959 --> 01:32:14,633
Now one more crazy
guy to join these two!

1295
01:32:14,695 --> 01:32:16,197
Somebody help me!

1296
01:32:16,297 --> 01:32:19,107
Go, Amar! Go, Amar!

1297
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:25,410
- Hey! He's gone mad.
- No, Amar! No, Amar! Leave me.

1298
01:32:25,473 --> 01:32:27,714
Forget that, look there.

1299
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:36,956
Sapna, see what these
three are trying to do with me.

1300
01:32:37,485 --> 01:32:39,624
We set out to be the hunter.

1301
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:42,428
Instead we're going to be hunted now.

1302
01:32:42,523 --> 01:32:44,366
Mom, did they do
such a thing with you?

1303
01:32:44,425 --> 01:32:47,804
Yes. Now even the elders
aren't safe in this house.

1304
01:32:48,296 --> 01:32:51,277
Lust has driven them mad.

1305
01:32:52,099 --> 01:32:55,444
Only one person can save us
from this trouble now.

1306
01:33:03,144 --> 01:33:08,184
I've lost it! I've lost it!

1307
01:33:08,282 --> 01:33:11,388
- I've lost it!
- Good that you've come, master.

1308
01:33:11,485 --> 01:33:13,328
It's good that you've come.

1309
01:33:13,387 --> 01:33:15,492
What happened?
You've been lying around these days.

1310
01:33:15,556 --> 01:33:18,036
You know what happened with me?

1311
01:33:20,695 --> 01:33:22,766
Mama's darling boy went astray.

1312
01:33:22,830 --> 01:33:26,710
Not just went astray,
he even pounced on mom-in-law.

1313
01:33:27,368 --> 01:33:31,339
Bad thing! Very, very.. bad thing.

1314
01:33:31,706 --> 01:33:33,845
Sire, please do something.

1315
01:33:33,908 --> 01:33:36,752
Yes, sire. You're the only hope now.

1316
01:33:36,844 --> 01:33:39,984
Sire, what will you do?
Please tell me.

1317
01:33:40,081 --> 01:33:44,188
We'll perform a fire sacrifice.

1318
01:33:44,986 --> 01:33:48,331
The answer to those three
horny men is in my bag.

1319
01:33:48,556 --> 01:33:53,027
Tonight, I'll summon all the spirits
and perform such a sacrifice..

1320
01:33:53,127 --> 01:33:55,038
...that their lust will..

1321
01:33:55,096 --> 01:34:02,378
Out.. out“ run out!

1322
01:34:02,737 --> 01:34:06,446
Sire, will they roam around
freely like this till then?

1323
01:34:06,741 --> 01:34:09,347
I have a solution for that,
Saira Banu.

1324
01:34:09,443 --> 01:34:12,754
Worry.. why worry?

1325
01:34:16,017 --> 01:34:20,488
You and me are locked in
a room and the keys are lost.

1326
01:34:20,921 --> 01:34:22,992
Sire, the keys.

1327
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:24,301
Open, dear.

1328
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:26,403
Safe deposit.

1329
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:31,838
Now you'll get the
keys only after the ritual.

1330
01:34:31,899 --> 01:34:32,673
C'mon now.

1331
01:34:32,733 --> 01:34:34,212
Praise be to the singing master!

1332
01:34:34,268 --> 01:34:36,407
- Sire..
- Mom..

1333
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:39,713
Mom, don't do this.

1334
01:34:42,076 --> 01:34:44,386
It's my birthday today.

1335
01:34:44,712 --> 01:34:46,885
And you're all standing
here with such gloomy faces.

1336
01:34:47,114 --> 01:34:49,754
We should definitely
have some song and dance.

1337
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:52,998
OK, I'll sing.

1338
01:34:53,087 --> 01:34:56,660
"I made an entry and bells
began to ring in the heart."

1339
01:35:00,161 --> 01:35:03,802
"Listen to the commentary
of the heart and love is guaranteed."

1340
01:35:11,038 --> 01:35:13,644
Mom, where is the sound
of bells coming from?

1341
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,949
It's the master's grace, my dear.

1342
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:19,054
The master's arrival has
transformed the house into a temple.

1343
01:35:19,213 --> 01:35:22,490
It's either the bells ringing
or the offerings being made.

1344
01:35:22,817 --> 01:35:25,297
Praise be to the Singing Monk!

1345
01:35:28,823 --> 01:35:30,166
Had fun?

1346
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:34,867
We'll keep the rest of
the fun for our time together.

1347
01:35:36,097 --> 01:35:38,407
You've made me wait a lot.

1348
01:35:38,699 --> 01:35:41,339
You'll have to pay
the price for the delay.

1349
01:35:41,969 --> 01:35:44,848
Now I don't want one of you,
but all three.

1350
01:35:44,905 --> 01:35:46,680
- All three?
- Yes.

1351
01:35:47,074 --> 01:35:50,351
By the way,
you have time till tonight.

1352
01:35:50,778 --> 01:35:53,190
Go and meet your wives.

1353
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:55,822
Tell her whatever you want.

1354
01:35:56,283 --> 01:35:59,594
I'll wait for my gift at night.

1355
01:36:00,955 --> 01:36:03,959
It's my birthday and
the day you three die.

1356
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:05,964
We'll celebrate all three together.

1357
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:10,840
...tonight.

1358
01:36:16,504 --> 01:36:19,075
Here's your salad.

1359
01:36:19,173 --> 01:36:21,312
Go on, you also join us.

1360
01:36:22,276 --> 01:36:24,688
Why aren't you three eating?

1361
01:36:25,513 --> 01:36:27,356
Well, mom..

1362
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:29,359
No, don't tell me..

1363
01:36:29,683 --> 01:36:32,857
...that you have observed
a fast for them.

1364
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,593
They aren't worth it.

1365
01:36:34,755 --> 01:36:36,632
Eat your food. Eat it.

1366
01:36:36,724 --> 01:36:38,795
You're absolutely right, mom.

1367
01:36:38,893 --> 01:36:43,603
By misbehaving with you,
they've crossed all limits.

1368
01:36:43,764 --> 01:36:46,711
I hate them.

1369
01:36:49,870 --> 01:36:52,612
Marrying them was the
biggest mistake of our lives.

1370
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:54,751
They destroyed our lives.

1371
01:36:57,611 --> 01:37:02,253
To observe a fast for such a disgusting
man is an insult to the custom.

1372
01:37:10,791 --> 01:37:13,533
They used to swear by
our love once upon a time.

1373
01:37:13,594 --> 01:37:15,870
And today,
they're eating on Karva Chauth day.

1374
01:37:15,963 --> 01:37:17,806
It's good that Ragini is killing us.

1375
01:37:17,865 --> 01:37:19,003
We'll be rid of them.

1376
01:37:19,066 --> 01:37:22,206
They're a blemish on
the reputation of wives.

1377
01:37:22,436 --> 01:37:24,473
Death is better than
living with such wives.

1378
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:18,860
We've decided who amongst the three of
us will get into bed with you first.

1379
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:22,463
Really? Who?

1380
01:38:24,131 --> 01:38:24,939
Nobody.

1381
01:38:25,032 --> 01:38:26,010
What?!

1382
01:38:26,934 --> 01:38:29,175
Don't you know the
consequences of refusing me?

1383
01:38:29,536 --> 01:38:31,072
Don't you!

1384
01:38:33,674 --> 01:38:36,951
Shall I tell you something?
I'm very cowardly.

1385
01:38:37,544 --> 01:38:39,319
The smallest of things freak me out.

1386
01:38:40,047 --> 01:38:43,256
But today, despite you standing
there and saying all this..

1387
01:38:44,251 --> 01:38:45,821
...I'm not scared.

1388
01:38:47,354 --> 01:38:51,393
Because we know that our
wives are observing a fast for us.

1389
01:38:52,426 --> 01:38:54,531
That's why you can't harm us.

1390
01:38:58,332 --> 01:39:01,040
You trust your wives so much.

1391
01:39:01,268 --> 01:39:03,942
OK, let's see.

1392
01:39:10,744 --> 01:39:13,987
Hey! What was that noise?
What happened?

1393
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:16,528
- Let's check it out, mom.
- C'mon.

1394
01:39:16,583 --> 01:39:18,392
Out.. out“ run out!

1395
01:39:31,932 --> 01:39:33,809
What's going on here?

1396
01:39:36,103 --> 01:39:37,309
And who is she?

1397
01:39:37,738 --> 01:39:40,241
All of you can see her?

1398
01:39:40,541 --> 01:39:43,647
She's not a ghost
to be invisible to us.

1399
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:45,951
Who are you and what
are you doing in this house?

1400
01:39:48,182 --> 01:39:50,628
I live here since the last 70 years.

1401
01:39:51,585 --> 01:39:53,394
20 years as a human.

1402
01:39:53,887 --> 01:39:56,697
50 years as a ghost.

1403
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:05,705
If you're a ghost, then look here.

1404
01:40:05,766 --> 01:40:07,109
I'm a witch.

1405
01:40:11,038 --> 01:40:13,245
Your mom-in-law will
get herself killed. -Really?

1406
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:19,958
Shut up! She's pretending
to be a ghost in my presence.

1407
01:40:20,014 --> 01:40:23,894
Somebody explain to her
how terrifying I am to ghosts.

1408
01:40:23,984 --> 01:40:27,557
Witches feed their children
by showing my photo.

1409
01:40:27,654 --> 01:40:31,431
They tell them to sleep,
or else the Singing Monk will arrive.

1410
01:40:31,492 --> 01:40:33,233
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

1411
01:40:33,293 --> 01:40:35,432
That's why I'm telling you, my child..

1412
01:40:36,196 --> 01:40:39,575
Out.. out“ run out!

1413
01:40:39,633 --> 01:40:42,978
Out.. out“ run out!

1414
01:40:43,070 --> 01:40:47,416
If you're a ghost,
then I'm a large tree.

1415
01:40:47,474 --> 01:40:53,015
Huge organic watermelons
pop out of me all day..

1416
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:56,926
...for the well-being of mankind.
Isn't it? -Yes.

1417
01:41:01,588 --> 01:41:04,296
- Oh no!
- What happened to the master?

1418
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:20,817
Watermelon!

1419
01:41:23,243 --> 01:41:25,883
Thank god he didn't say pineapple.

1420
01:41:29,850 --> 01:41:32,956
Oh god! She's really a ghost!

1421
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:34,897
Ghost! Ghost!

1422
01:41:34,955 --> 01:41:38,698
Do you know why I appeared
before all of them?

1423
01:41:39,526 --> 01:41:44,134
So that I can kill the
three of you in their presence.

1424
01:41:44,531 --> 01:41:48,638
Now I'll see how their
fast saves your lives.

1425
01:42:26,607 --> 01:42:28,678
- Dad's staff?
- Dad's staff?

1426
01:42:29,676 --> 01:42:31,178
Mine?

1427
01:42:31,645 --> 01:42:32,453
No.

1428
01:42:32,546 --> 01:42:33,718
Dad's staff.

1429
01:42:39,052 --> 01:42:40,963
Dad's staff.

1430
01:42:41,188 --> 01:42:42,895
- It seems it's her father's staff.
- What?

1431
01:42:48,695 --> 01:42:51,107
See this.

1432
01:42:51,365 --> 01:42:53,971
She's under control now, the ghost!

1433
01:42:58,739 --> 01:43:01,583
Where were you hiding
all this while? Where?

1434
01:43:02,142 --> 01:43:05,123
You don't know how much
she has troubled us. -Yes.

1435
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:06,886
Now it's our turn.

1436
01:43:14,087 --> 01:43:16,226
Hey, shut up, what?

1437
01:43:16,423 --> 01:43:19,802
You keep making weird
noises all the time!

1438
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:20,804
Are you mad?

1439
01:43:22,162 --> 01:43:25,075
Stand quietly or I'll slap you hard.

1440
01:43:25,399 --> 01:43:27,174
Slap? Just a slap?

1441
01:43:27,234 --> 01:43:28,372
You're very soft-hearted, Amar.

1442
01:43:28,435 --> 01:43:31,439
Haven't you heard the adage, ghosts
don't yield to talks, but kicks.

1443
01:43:31,538 --> 01:43:32,710
Hand it to me. -What?

1444
01:43:32,773 --> 01:43:34,150
The staff, what else!

1445
01:43:36,843 --> 01:43:38,288
Give it to me.

1446
01:43:38,378 --> 01:43:40,984
Mad ghost,
you'll pop out watermelons, eh!

1447
01:43:41,048 --> 01:43:44,586
Now see how I make you
pop out a bowl of fruit salad.

1448
01:43:45,252 --> 01:43:46,697
What are you guys doing?

1449
01:43:46,753 --> 01:43:47,925
Let's run from here.

1450
01:43:48,021 --> 01:43:51,764
How can we leave?
The party has just begun.

1451
01:43:52,626 --> 01:43:54,902
C'mon, let's go to the dance floor.

1452
01:44:02,603 --> 01:44:04,514
Burn to ashes, beautiful!

1453
01:44:05,672 --> 01:44:07,549
We're going to make
you die a terrible death.

1454
01:44:07,608 --> 01:44:10,179
And you won't be able to
do anything to us. Take that!

1455
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:13,885
Exactly. This is known
as killing the snake..

1456
01:44:13,981 --> 01:44:16,018
...without breaking the staff.

1457
01:44:22,122 --> 01:44:23,829
- Prem..
- Shut up, Amar.

1458
01:44:24,224 --> 01:44:26,761
You don't know about my fury.

1459
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:29,162
Once I lose my cool..

1460
01:44:29,263 --> 01:44:31,072
Dad's staff broke.

1461
01:44:31,365 --> 01:44:32,969
...I calm down quickly.

1462
01:44:36,737 --> 01:44:39,240
Oh god, run!

1463
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:44,888
Brother!

1464
01:44:46,213 --> 01:44:49,319
At least everybody is
receiving the shock now.

1465
01:44:51,385 --> 01:44:53,956
Even the watermelon popping
out of me didn't give you the brains.

1466
01:44:54,054 --> 01:44:56,330
Who told you to grab the doors?

1467
01:44:57,057 --> 01:44:58,229
He's mad.

1468
01:44:59,926 --> 01:45:02,167
Two minutes. Just two minutes.

1469
01:45:02,496 --> 01:45:04,703
That's all the time
left for all of you.

1470
01:45:05,165 --> 01:45:08,908
The moment dad's fire burns out,
your pyres will burn.

1471
01:45:12,539 --> 01:45:13,950
What do we do?

1472
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:15,952
Idea!

1473
01:45:18,345 --> 01:45:19,847
Igor it!

1474
01:45:19,946 --> 01:45:23,086
See this, your dad's underwear.
Fear it!

1475
01:45:24,117 --> 01:45:28,588
You fool, she feared her
father's staff, not his underwear.

1476
01:45:28,655 --> 01:45:31,795
To scare her you've
to call her father directly.

1477
01:45:31,858 --> 01:45:34,168
- Yes, but how?
- How..

1478
01:45:34,394 --> 01:45:36,101
- The Singing Monk.
- Yes.

1479
01:45:36,163 --> 01:45:37,005
Master!

1480
01:45:37,097 --> 01:45:39,737
Master, only you can save us from her.

1481
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:41,370
I don't know to summon spirits.

1482
01:45:41,435 --> 01:45:42,539
- What?!
- Yes.

1483
01:45:42,602 --> 01:45:46,140
See, I press the buttons
on this to move the coin.

1484
01:45:47,274 --> 01:45:47,809
What?

1485
01:45:47,874 --> 01:45:53,290
Not this ghost,
I'll choke you to death.

1486
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:57,829
C'mon, just chill.
It's dirty, but it's business.

1487
01:45:57,884 --> 01:46:00,023
Sire, give me the bag.
Give me the bag.

1488
01:46:00,220 --> 01:46:01,460
It seems we'll have
to do something. -Yes.

1489
01:46:01,555 --> 01:46:03,057
Bloody imposter! Let's go.

1490
01:46:07,828 --> 01:46:08,932
Place your fingers on it.

1491
01:46:09,029 --> 01:46:10,508
Wherever you are daddy' spirit,
please appear!

1492
01:46:10,564 --> 01:46:13,511
Wherever you are daddy' spirit,
please appear!

1493
01:46:13,567 --> 01:46:16,605
Wherever you are daddy' spirit,
please appear!

1494
01:46:16,703 --> 01:46:20,446
Wherever you are daddy' spirit,
please appear!

1495
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:22,577
Oh man! Why isn't this coin moving?

1496
01:46:22,642 --> 01:46:25,714
Buddy, before I die,
I want to say something honestly.

1497
01:46:25,779 --> 01:46:27,781
I know that it's my idea
that gets us killed every time.

1498
01:46:31,218 --> 01:46:32,663
The coin moved.

1499
01:46:33,253 --> 01:46:34,095
HOW?

1500
01:46:36,523 --> 01:46:38,400
Truth along triumphs.

1501
01:46:38,892 --> 01:46:40,269
I understood.

1502
01:46:40,327 --> 01:46:41,738
My father used to say..

1503
01:46:41,795 --> 01:46:44,901
...that to summon a spirit, the mind
should be clean and the soul honest.

1504
01:46:44,965 --> 01:46:47,138
But I always resorted to lies.

1505
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:48,941
That's why I could
never summon a spirit.

1506
01:46:49,002 --> 01:46:51,608
But the moment Prem spoke the truth,
the coin moved.

1507
01:46:52,906 --> 01:46:55,750
That means, if we speak the truth,
the coin will move?

1508
01:46:55,809 --> 01:46:56,947
Yes, it surely will.

1509
01:46:57,277 --> 01:46:59,382
Then what are you wondering?
Speak the truth quickly.

1510
01:46:59,446 --> 01:47:00,516
But what?

1511
01:47:00,580 --> 01:47:05,325
Say that you can't find
a better mom-in-law than me.

1512
01:47:06,386 --> 01:47:08,627
I can't find a better
mom-in-law than you.

1513
01:47:13,827 --> 01:47:15,067
Speak the truth.

1514
01:47:15,128 --> 01:47:16,698
Amar, the fire is burning out.

1515
01:47:18,732 --> 01:47:20,336
Sneak it!

1516
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:23,180
You're a mad old woman.

1517
01:47:23,570 --> 01:47:25,413
You've ruined my life.

1518
01:47:25,605 --> 01:47:27,710
If you really miss
your husband so much..

1519
01:47:27,774 --> 01:47:31,722
...then instead of bringing him down
to earth, why don't you go up instead?

1520
01:47:31,778 --> 01:47:33,451
You'll be happy and so will I.

1521
01:47:33,547 --> 01:47:36,289
The whole world will be happy,
damn you!

1522
01:47:36,383 --> 01:47:37,555
Damn you?

1523
01:47:37,751 --> 01:47:39,059
Shut up, Amar.

1524
01:47:43,690 --> 01:47:46,864
- The coin moved.
- The coin moved.

1525
01:47:46,927 --> 01:47:49,203
- Well done, Amar. Continue.
- Yes.

1526
01:47:50,063 --> 01:47:51,770
Hey, what do you mean by continue?

1527
01:47:51,865 --> 01:47:53,344
Will I alone speak the truth?

1528
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:55,311
You also speak the truth
about your brother-in-law.

1529
01:47:55,836 --> 01:47:57,543
What about me?

1530
01:47:57,604 --> 01:48:02,713
Nothing, just that you're
the apple of my eyes. My darling.

1531
01:48:02,776 --> 01:48:04,551
Thank you, Meet.

1532
01:48:05,979 --> 01:48:07,515
The coin isn't moving.

1533
01:48:07,581 --> 01:48:08,958
Meet, the fire..

1534
01:48:10,851 --> 01:48:12,455
Speak up!

1535
01:48:12,986 --> 01:48:16,024
You're not the apple of my eyes,
but the rot in my love life.

1536
01:48:16,089 --> 01:48:17,659
You cross-connection!

1537
01:48:17,757 --> 01:48:21,933
Seeing you, I realized why
people curse their brothers-in-law.

1538
01:48:22,028 --> 01:48:23,974
You're not a human, but a wild bull.

1539
01:48:24,064 --> 01:48:25,941
Not a wild bull, but a donkey's.

1540
01:48:26,733 --> 01:48:28,007
Did you understand?

1541
01:48:28,101 --> 01:48:31,048
He called me a bull.

1542
01:48:31,371 --> 01:48:33,942
I hate you, Meet. I hate you!

1543
01:48:38,411 --> 01:48:41,688
- The coin moved.
- The coin moved.

1544
01:48:41,781 --> 01:48:43,226
The coin moved.

1545
01:48:43,283 --> 01:48:45,593
Prem, it's your turn now.

1546
01:48:45,652 --> 01:48:46,653
Say it.

1547
01:48:48,755 --> 01:48:51,201
My name is Prem. I'm a man.

1548
01:48:51,258 --> 01:48:53,067
I'm 32 years old.

1549
01:48:54,394 --> 01:48:57,375
You loser, we're not submitting
our bio-data for a job.

1550
01:48:57,464 --> 01:49:01,037
You've to speak the true
feelings of your heart, rascal.

1551
01:49:05,906 --> 01:49:08,079
Prem, speak the truth.

1552
01:49:08,942 --> 01:49:11,923
One needs brains to think
and you lack it, foolish girl.

1553
01:49:11,978 --> 01:49:14,618
You keep saying, 'Prem shook..'

1554
01:49:14,714 --> 01:49:16,318
Not me, but you're
shaken in your head.

1555
01:49:16,383 --> 01:49:20,798
Because of you sleeping between us my
rat is suffering from plague. Plague!

1556
01:49:21,821 --> 01:49:23,494
- Sister.
- Sorry, dean.

1557
01:49:24,391 --> 01:49:25,893
What nonsense are you talking?

1558
01:49:29,529 --> 01:49:32,635
Prem, the coin moved. Oh!

1559
01:49:32,699 --> 01:49:33,700
That's done.

1560
01:49:33,767 --> 01:49:35,678
Now, we just need
to speak one more truth.

1561
01:49:36,002 --> 01:49:39,108
Enough. Dare you say another word.

1562
01:49:39,506 --> 01:49:42,749
Do you hate our family
members so much? -Yes, we do.

1563
01:49:43,777 --> 01:49:44,983
Do you know why?

1564
01:49:45,712 --> 01:49:47,692
Because they keep us away from you.

1565
01:49:48,048 --> 01:49:50,358
You turn a blind eye
to us in their presence.

1566
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:52,457
That's why we came
here to cheat on you.

1567
01:49:55,355 --> 01:49:56,925
But now we realize..

1568
01:49:57,390 --> 01:50:00,599
...that we were cheating
ourselves and not you.

1569
01:50:04,331 --> 01:50:08,905
Because all the fun in the
world can't match up to your love.

1570
01:50:12,305 --> 01:50:14,216
And today, we swear on that love..

1571
01:50:14,941 --> 01:50:18,548
...that we'll die but never betray you.

1572
01:51:01,121 --> 01:51:04,000
- Dad..
- Not your dad, but Babu.

1573
01:51:04,224 --> 01:51:06,295
I'm Babu Rangeela.

1574
01:51:06,393 --> 01:51:09,272
I'm of loose character.

1575
01:51:11,965 --> 01:51:14,172
Because once I commit.

1576
01:51:14,234 --> 01:51:16,407
...then he doesn't listen even to me.

1577
01:51:41,227 --> 01:51:45,300
Even I have a staff
to bring you under control.

1578
01:51:52,739 --> 01:51:53,649
Babu.

1579
01:51:53,707 --> 01:51:55,380
Rangeela.

1580
01:51:56,509 --> 01:51:58,045
I loves you.

1581
01:52:36,549 --> 01:52:37,425
WOW!

1582
01:52:53,066 --> 01:52:54,204
Crazy.. Choti?

1583
01:52:54,267 --> 01:52:55,405
Bull.. Lakshman?

1584
01:52:55,468 --> 01:52:56,742
Choti, aren't you ashamed?

1585
01:52:56,803 --> 01:52:58,373
What will the elders of
the house think if they see you?

1586
01:52:58,438 --> 01:52:59,644
What will they think?

1587
01:52:59,739 --> 01:53:02,948
Sorry, we made a mistake.

1588
01:53:04,444 --> 01:53:05,923
They did a mistake.

1589
01:53:14,354 --> 01:53:15,059
Mom!

1590
01:53:15,121 --> 01:53:16,794
Dad! I mean, master!

1591
01:53:16,890 --> 01:53:20,235
Not master, but the master's staff.

1592
01:53:22,929 --> 01:53:24,374
They're talking about your mother.

1593
01:53:25,298 --> 01:53:26,242
Come.

1594
01:53:26,866 --> 01:53:28,038
Mom..

1595
01:53:28,434 --> 01:53:30,744
Earlier, she used to be shameless
and look at her blush now.

1596
01:53:32,972 --> 01:53:33,973
Dad.. hello.

1597
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:36,042
Forget the hello and quickly
touch my feet, you fool.

1598
01:53:36,109 --> 01:53:38,089
- Why quickly?
- We've to go on a honeymoon.

1599
01:53:38,144 --> 01:53:40,249
Oh.. everybody goes on one.

1600
01:53:43,049 --> 01:53:45,188
Thanks, Babu.

1601
01:53:45,518 --> 01:53:47,657
You saved the lives of our husbands.

1602
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:50,200
But you came to see the
house yesterday, isn't it?

1603
01:53:50,423 --> 01:53:52,198
Then how did you die all of a sudden?

1604
01:53:55,995 --> 01:53:57,099
What happened?

1605
01:53:57,764 --> 01:54:00,506
Don't eat chicken ever again.
Become vegetarians.

1606
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:01,644
OK.

1607
01:54:01,801 --> 01:54:02,779
OK.

1608
01:54:03,770 --> 01:54:07,582
Sorry, I troubled all of you.

1609
01:54:09,075 --> 01:54:12,318
But what could I do?
That's the nature of fun.

1610
01:54:12,712 --> 01:54:15,454
You didn't get it for six months
and this was your condition.

1611
01:54:15,715 --> 01:54:18,924
Think about it..
I waited for 50 years.

1612
01:54:19,419 --> 01:54:20,659
It's alright.

1613
01:54:21,154 --> 01:54:22,258
We can understand.

1614
01:54:22,355 --> 01:54:24,892
In fact, we should be thanking you.

1615
01:54:24,958 --> 01:54:25,868
Thank you, Ragu.

1616
01:54:25,925 --> 01:54:28,963
Your horror story
set our love story right.
