1
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,911
Residents ofKailash Nagar
and membersof the RoyalCourt...

2
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:28,984
It is quitesome time
since thedeath of...

3
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:34,793
... the king ofthis province
our well wisher,King Chandrabhan.

4
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,629
Though no hasinherited his
throne, yet hispious soul...

5
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:39,023
...hasalwaysbeenguiding us
to runthe kingdom ably.

6
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:43,258
Asthe chief minister of
this kingdom and a loyal...

7
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,233
... subject of the king, I take
pride in making an announcement...

8
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,670
... that the period for which the
deceased king had asked me to...

9
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:54,412
... shoulder responsibility of
running the kingdom, will end...

10
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:55,943
... by the beginning of
the next month.

11
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,116
Today on the auspicious
occasion of Holi,...

12
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:02,286
and according to the desire
of our deceased king, I decree,...

13
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:06,457
that on the first day
of the next month...

14
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:10,760
the coronation of our dear prince
should be formalized.

15
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:16,024
But the prince hasn't still
come to the court.

16
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:19,202
Today is the last time, I will
be acting as a custodian.

17
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:25,206
I am sure the prince will ably
carry out his responsibility.

18
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,297
With my coming, why is there
silence at this gathering?

19
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,836
It's not just a gathering,
the royal court is in session.

20
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,268
Today an announcement for
your coronation was made.

21
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,376
You should have been
present in the court.

22
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:05,582
I ask for forgiveness. I got
delayed because of my friend.

23
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,683
You mean because
of this animal?

24
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:14,092
Sometimes animals turn out to be
more loyal than human beings.

25
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:25,900
With the permission of my dear mother,
who knows the prince...

26
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,505
better than I do,
I request all of you to...

27
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:35,008
... greet and congratulate the
prince, and our future king.

28
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:41,612
Salutations to
Prince Devinder Bahadur.

29
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:15,779
O God, when will you
ever learn...

30
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:20,121
that such kind of fun and games
are for the subjects.

31
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,827
People from the royal family have
to be tough and stone hearted.

32
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,363
No, aunty. My heart
is just like yours.

33
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,964
It has no ulterior motives.
It's clear like a mirror.

34
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:34,298
If I make my heart
like a stone, how will...

35
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,508
... I know the feelings
of my subjects. Right, isn't it?

36
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:41,677
All right. I will soon
get you married, so...

37
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,744
... that you are
trapped once for all.

38
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,852
Yes, mother is right.
You should know...

39
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,988
not only preparations for
your coronation, but...

40
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,155
... also for your
marriage are being made.

41
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,520
Princess Chandramukhi has been
invited to attend your coronation.

42
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,899
I have heard such long sounding
royal names many a times.

43
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,535
But when I finally see her, she' ll be
so frightening to look at...

44
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:35,430
Such beautiful hair, a moon-like
face, lotus shaped eyes...

45
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,929
isn't she as pretty as the
moon, just like her name is.

46
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:03,753
"Say it with colors today...
in body and soul"

47
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,661
"Say it with colors today...
in body and soul"

48
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:13,633
" Play all you want to...
and fulfill your desires"

49
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:18,707
"Say it with colors today...
in body and soul"

50
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,075
"There's color
everywhere around today"

51
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,753
" In every lane,
they spray color"

52
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,220
" In every lane,
they spray color"

53
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:35,083
" In the squirt,
there's the color of love"

54
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,856
" In the squirt,
there's the color of love"

55
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:43,364
"Color your lives
in this hue"

56
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:49,131
" Play all you want to...
and fulfill your desires"

57
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:54,136
"Say it with colors today...
in body and soul"

58
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:16,763
" Dance with me, my friends...
for here is the festival of colors"

59
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:26,934
" In every household,
color casts a spell"

60
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:32,309
"The world indulges
in revelry today"

61
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:37,954
"Color your minds then..."

62
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:43,490
" Play all you want to...
and fulfill your desires"

63
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:48,563
"Say it with colors today...
in body and soul"

64
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,604
"Take the veil off
your face today"

65
00:07:56,943 --> 00:08:01,812
" Look at your beloved
without a care"

66
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:07,245
"These fake colors,
do not spray on me"

67
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:12,481
" In love, you may
color me"

68
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:18,688
" Play all you want to...
and fulfill your desires"

69
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:23,094
"Say it with colors today...
in body and soul"

70
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:45,655
" With Radha, Krishna plays
the festival of colors"

71
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:55,699
"On her, he sprays color
from the pipe"

72
00:08:55,968 --> 00:09:01,406
" He twists her arm,
the ignorant one"

73
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:06,578
" My heart beats...
so color yourself"

74
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:11,783
" Play all you want to...
and fulfill your desires"

75
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:17,250
"Say it with colors today...
in body and soul"

76
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,752
The kingdom's military commander
offers greetings to the princess...

77
00:09:34,956 --> 00:09:37,015
... on the festival of Holi.

78
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,149
The color fell on you
by mistake.

79
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,760
I hope you will continue
to repeat such mistakes.

80
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:45,698
This is the ladies wing.
How dare you enter here?

81
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:50,028
I' m guilty. Here's the dagger,
you can pierce my heart.

82
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:55,438
This innocent girl has no
idea of the hunter's strength.

83
00:10:25,373 --> 00:10:28,035
- Did you send for me father?
- Yes my child.

84
00:10:30,245 --> 00:10:32,907
How is the king's health now?

85
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:38,380
If the king stops worrying,
he will recover soon.

86
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,910
Take this, Your Highness.

87
00:10:41,155 --> 00:10:43,453
Let me give it with
my own hands.

88
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:46,924
So that I receive his blessings.

89
00:10:48,463 --> 00:10:57,565
... may you, my darling daughter,
be the queen of two kingdoms.

90
00:10:58,373 --> 00:11:03,572
The late king of Kailash Nagar,
Chandrabhan Singh, was my dear friend.

91
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:08,841
His son prince Devinder Pratap
is going to be coroneted.

92
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,880
- So?
- He has sent this invitation.

93
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,986
But how will you go in
this condition?

94
00:11:19,294 --> 00:11:23,628
The caretaker ruler, wife of
Divan Veer Singh,...

95
00:11:23,998 --> 00:11:27,161
...who has brought up the prince
like her own son,...

96
00:11:27,535 --> 00:11:31,665
insists on your going there.
- Why is that?

97
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,070
She desires that Princess
Chandramukhi should be the queen...

98
00:11:36,444 --> 00:11:40,346
... of both the kingdoms.

99
00:11:41,115 --> 00:11:46,052
She has also sent this gift.
Take a look. Take it.

100
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:54,185
Tuesday is auspicious. I have
ordered the entourage to proceed.

101
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:06,797
I feel the princess should
not make this trip alone.

102
00:12:07,141 --> 00:12:10,872
But can't your brave soldiers
take care of her safety?

103
00:12:11,212 --> 00:12:15,114
The princess' journey should
have my personal protection.

104
00:12:16,651 --> 00:12:18,642
I am not going to a battle.

105
00:12:18,953 --> 00:12:22,889
My child, this shows the
commander's loyalty.

106
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:25,455
Whether it is loyalty or
a proof of his cowardice...

107
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,217
... I don't wish to
go with him father.

108
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:29,928
Your Highness the princess
does not understand the affairs...

109
00:12:30,164 --> 00:12:31,461
... of the state, at all.

110
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:35,968
I cannot displease my
daughter at any cost.

111
00:12:37,905 --> 00:12:41,068
Go my child.
May God protect you.

112
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:16,971
In this basket lies this fool's
death, and victory of my dreams.

113
00:13:19,547 --> 00:13:24,143
This snake god not only brings
God's message,...

114
00:13:24,452 --> 00:13:27,114
but also takes away a man's life,
thus sending him to God.

115
00:13:27,822 --> 00:13:29,312
The prince has arrived.

116
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:46,572
I think I've come at the
wrong time.

117
00:13:46,874 --> 00:13:48,705
No, we were just....

118
00:13:49,043 --> 00:13:53,070
Were you involved in some
complex problem of the state?

119
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:57,374
- My coronation?
- Yes, yours.

120
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,060
I' m deeply under the
burden of your favors.

121
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:19,199
What would have been my
fate without you?

122
00:14:19,507 --> 00:14:22,408
You' ll probably forget me when
you sit on the throne.

123
00:14:26,848 --> 00:14:30,944
And what if I die before
I ascend the throne?

124
00:14:31,252 --> 00:14:32,617
What do you mean?

125
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:38,616
I am already worried.

126
00:14:41,596 --> 00:14:43,325
I've remembered something.

127
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:44,824
Where are you going?

128
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:51,504
To drown my worries amidst
beat of the music, the...

129
00:14:51,773 --> 00:14:54,241
... notes of flute, and the
the jingle of anklets.

130
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:10,254
How long will I tolerate this dust?
Come on, overtake him.

131
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:15,588
You ill-mannered fellow, move
aside and let us pass. Or else...

132
00:15:15,897 --> 00:15:18,297
What will you do?

133
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:21,030
I' ll cut you up
with my sword.

134
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:23,863
Which one? The one
sitting next to you?

135
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:28,107
You shameless man, you
call a knife a sword.

136
00:15:30,044 --> 00:15:33,411
Let it be, you fool.
Leave it, l' ll handle it.

137
00:15:42,857 --> 00:15:48,193
It gives us great pleasure
to see artists from far away...

138
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:52,295
... come to our town to
show their talent.

139
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,798
Today's function shall
begin with a dance.

140
00:16:05,346 --> 00:16:09,510
There's an open invitation to all the
singers to take part in this competition.

141
00:16:09,851 --> 00:16:12,411
You have our permission
to begin, Raj Lakshmi.

142
00:16:13,688 --> 00:16:15,417
Who will give the accompaniment?

143
00:16:19,694 --> 00:16:23,892
Forgive us, your Highness, we
cannot accompany this novice.

144
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:28,100
If this novice cannot keep pace,
she will give up wearing anklets.

145
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:33,296
Do you understand music,
its rhythm and nuances?

146
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,437
My talent will give you
the reply to your question.

147
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,110
Sir, I request
permission to accompany.

148
00:16:38,412 --> 00:16:41,404
What note will you play?
- l' ll play, the instrument and sing.

149
00:16:41,716 --> 00:16:44,207
I don't want this fool
to accompany me.

150
00:16:44,552 --> 00:16:46,747
Have you heard the notes of
Jaijaiwanti in Darbari and Malhar...

151
00:16:46,988 --> 00:16:48,455
... classical compositions?

152
00:16:48,723 --> 00:16:52,124
Once I begin you won't be able to
keep pace even with the first note.

153
00:16:52,393 --> 00:16:54,156
Your Highness, I think the
girl has developed cold feet.

154
00:16:54,595 --> 00:16:58,224
Give your permission sir. Let this
be settled in your presence.

155
00:17:07,174 --> 00:17:12,612
"the melodious notes
flow from Girdhar's flute"

156
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:19,146
" Radha dances in the
beautiful gardens..."

157
00:17:34,402 --> 00:17:39,499
" With dancing bells
tied to her feet..."

158
00:17:39,907 --> 00:17:44,810
" her veil covering
her face..."

159
00:17:45,112 --> 00:17:49,811
"with kohl in her eyes..."

160
00:17:50,117 --> 00:17:56,989
" Radha dances in the
beautiful gardens"

161
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:14,301
"She sways away,
the beautiful one..."

162
00:18:19,313 --> 00:18:24,478
"She sways away,
the beautiful one..."

163
00:18:24,885 --> 00:18:29,686
" like lightning piercing the skies"

164
00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:34,894
" Mischievous and playful
she appears to be..."

165
00:18:35,129 --> 00:18:41,830
"as Radha dances in
the beautiful forests"

166
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:46,836
"The mellifluous notes
flow from Krishna's flute"

167
00:18:47,141 --> 00:18:53,046
" Radha dances in the
beautiful gardens"

168
00:19:09,063 --> 00:19:14,160
" Radha dances in the
beautiful gardens..."

169
00:19:19,173 --> 00:19:23,075
" Radha dances in the
beautiful gardens..."

170
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:34,753
" Radha dances in the
beautiful gardens"

171
00:19:35,122 --> 00:19:37,886
" Radha dances..."

172
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:51,423
My son, God has saved your life.
The prince has got a new life.

173
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,500
What are you all waiting for?
Go away now.

174
00:22:57,005 --> 00:22:59,530
This is the result of your
carelessness, prince.

175
00:22:59,874 --> 00:23:02,001
You have no right to
play with your life.

176
00:23:02,911 --> 00:23:06,039
You mustn't step out of the palace
till the coronation is over.

177
00:23:07,515 --> 00:23:12,748
If death has to come, it can jump
over the palace walls too and come.

178
00:23:13,021 --> 00:23:17,253
I cannot understand who could have
so much hatred towards the prince.

179
00:23:17,592 --> 00:23:24,555
Not hate, its greed.
And I know the culprit well.

180
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:26,128
You know him well?

181
00:23:26,434 --> 00:23:28,994
- Yes, I know him well.
- Then why don't you reveal him?

182
00:23:29,203 --> 00:23:33,037
Such a criminal should be
fed to the dogs. Who is it?

183
00:23:33,474 --> 00:23:35,840
My lips are sealed, Aunt.

184
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:39,170
Does this make sense?
Why don't you counsel him father?

185
00:23:40,214 --> 00:23:43,615
Strange! Who has to
counsel whom!

186
00:23:43,851 --> 00:23:47,309
Prince, I don't like
your childish behavior.

187
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:53,886
The clever prince has
seen through our plan.

188
00:23:54,295 --> 00:23:57,526
Time is short. But we must
succeed in our plan at all cost.

189
00:23:57,932 --> 00:24:00,264
Therefore this will
be our final attempt.

190
00:24:00,635 --> 00:24:04,264
Balbir Singh!
I want to see your preparations.

191
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:13,994
Prince?

192
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:19,201
May I know what brought
you here so late at night.

193
00:26:19,507 --> 00:26:22,237
Only to let you know
that l' m alive, not dead.

194
00:26:23,244 --> 00:26:25,337
I don't follow what
you are saying?

195
00:26:25,646 --> 00:26:28,672
Before you understand what l
mean, it would have been better...

196
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:32,818
... if the earth had opened, and
swallowed a greedy person like you.

197
00:26:33,121 --> 00:26:34,383
That way I would have been saved
from the trouble of explaining,...

198
00:26:34,655 --> 00:26:35,849
... and you of understanding it.

199
00:26:36,257 --> 00:26:38,191
Being the custodian of the throne,
I order you to control your tongue.

200
00:26:38,493 --> 00:26:43,021
The people who brought disgrace to
you, instead of bringing my head.

201
00:26:43,331 --> 00:26:46,562
I' m telling you for the last time
that I cannot tolerate this insult.

202
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:51,635
Where are those cowards who came running
here? I saw them with my own eyes.

203
00:26:51,906 --> 00:26:57,902
Trust me prince, it has been my
duty to serve and protect you always.

204
00:26:58,846 --> 00:27:04,944
I gave my word to your late father.
I brought you up like my own son.

205
00:27:05,253 --> 00:27:06,618
How can I kill you?

206
00:27:16,898 --> 00:27:22,632
Look at yourself carefully and
repeat the oath you gave my father.

207
00:27:23,571 --> 00:27:27,564
Death would have been far better
than the humiliation, and guilt...

208
00:27:27,942 --> 00:27:29,671
... which you are now facing
in your old age.

209
00:27:30,311 --> 00:27:34,270
Why did you do all this? For this
throne and power and for this wealth...

210
00:27:34,615 --> 00:27:37,641
which is transitory, which no one
takes it with them.

211
00:27:38,553 --> 00:27:42,751
Shame on such greed and on a
life which turns its back...

212
00:27:43,057 --> 00:27:45,082
... on an oath and on a
sacred trust placed in it.

213
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,224
Listen to me prince....

214
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:53,194
I've always considered you as
my elder. I've always thought...

215
00:27:53,501 --> 00:27:55,628
... of your wife as my mother
and your son as my brother.

216
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:58,131
For the sake of the throne
I won't make your wife a widow...

217
00:27:58,406 --> 00:28:00,374
... and deprive your son
of a father.

218
00:28:00,942 --> 00:28:03,536
I don't want a throne...

219
00:28:03,978 --> 00:28:07,470
which depends on my losing a mother's
love and a friend's trust.

220
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:11,382
You may grab all this power which
you crave for, because l' m leaving.

221
00:28:11,652 --> 00:28:14,621
But remember, if there is any
justice in this world then you...

222
00:28:14,922 --> 00:28:17,186
... will see the crown on my head.

223
00:28:37,245 --> 00:28:43,275
Follow the prince and make sure
that you bring back his dead body...

224
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:45,812
before he leaves the
borders of the kingdom.

225
00:29:29,997 --> 00:29:33,455
The prime minister's problem
has been solved on its own.

226
00:29:33,734 --> 00:29:35,668
But he wanted us to bring
back his dead body.

227
00:29:36,003 --> 00:29:38,028
He has fallen from such a
height that you won't find...

228
00:29:38,306 --> 00:29:39,273
... even his bones, let
alone his dead body.

229
00:29:39,573 --> 00:29:42,133
It's enough to confirm his
death. Let's go.

230
00:29:56,424 --> 00:30:01,521
Come on quickly my dear.
I' m dying of thirst...

231
00:30:01,996 --> 00:30:04,658
and you are shaking your
waist and strolling.

232
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:09,695
How often I've told you not to
comment on my tender waist.

233
00:30:10,037 --> 00:30:12,801
It's been paining
since yesterday.

234
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,801
Rub manure of a black buffalo,
you' ll be all right at once.

235
00:30:17,044 --> 00:30:18,636
Who are you?

236
00:30:18,946 --> 00:30:21,506
You keep quiet. Who are you?

237
00:30:22,116 --> 00:30:26,075
A waft of air, and dust. It
enters from one side and...

238
00:30:26,387 --> 00:30:28,116
... Ieaves from the other.

239
00:30:28,456 --> 00:30:34,019
See, even my soles have worn out.
I need a place to rest for tonight.

240
00:30:34,362 --> 00:30:35,624
For the entire night?

241
00:30:35,863 --> 00:30:37,694
You shut up!

242
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:42,794
Sir, go away.
This is princess Chandramukhi's camp.

243
00:30:43,237 --> 00:30:44,534
Princess Chandramukhi's?

244
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:50,800
Yes. It's not a guest house.
What are you staring at? Go away.

245
00:30:51,178 --> 00:30:54,944
What are you staring at me?
Come on go away now.

246
00:30:55,316 --> 00:30:59,252
Come on go out from here.

247
00:30:59,487 --> 00:31:01,955
What are you looking there for?
Come on this side.

248
00:31:07,194 --> 00:31:12,188
These dark tresses seem a burden
on your tender shoulders.

249
00:31:12,633 --> 00:31:15,659
Yes, Champa my neck hurts.

250
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:20,873
That moment is very near when this
burden will be on someone else.

251
00:31:21,675 --> 00:31:26,578
- What will he be like I wonder.
- You must be dreaming of him surely.

252
00:31:27,415 --> 00:31:31,442
Yes. Actually I feel
his presence even now.

253
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:46,830
Lord, it seems l' ll
always remain unwed.

254
00:31:47,101 --> 00:31:48,534
No.

255
00:31:49,003 --> 00:31:52,131
- You always say that.
- What do I say?

256
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,237
You sent him and then
snatched him away too.

257
00:31:56,577 --> 00:31:58,875
Go and sleep.

258
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:39,843
From across the clouds a holy man
has come from the holy pilgrimage...

259
00:32:40,154 --> 00:32:44,250
... of Badrinath
to bless the princess.

260
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:46,924
Go away!

261
00:32:51,232 --> 00:32:52,494
You won't go till you are
not pushed, and slapped.

262
00:32:52,766 --> 00:32:56,532
Be careful. Don't even think
of doing that to a holy man.

263
00:32:56,737 --> 00:32:59,968
Otherwise fate will deliver
punches on you...

264
00:33:00,274 --> 00:33:05,211
from its own supply, which it keeps.

265
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:09,313
Stop them princess. They are
coming in the way of the good...

266
00:33:09,617 --> 00:33:11,585
... fortune that's coming to you.

267
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,448
They want to remove your beloved
from your sight forever.

268
00:33:17,725 --> 00:33:20,694
Don't say that, Your Holiness.
What is it that you want?

269
00:33:20,995 --> 00:33:23,896
A disciple of God wants
nothing from mankind.

270
00:33:24,165 --> 00:33:33,597
Lord Shankar, get rid of
these girls, and save her.

271
00:33:33,941 --> 00:33:38,344
Princess, I appeal to
you for help. I' m ruined.

272
00:33:38,712 --> 00:33:43,376
- Someone's cut it.
- Who has cut what?

273
00:33:43,717 --> 00:33:47,312
My long hair.
Who will marry me now?

274
00:33:47,621 --> 00:33:52,024
- She has surely sinned.
- No I haven't your Holiness....

275
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:54,919
Quiet. After promising a brave
soldier your love,...

276
00:33:55,196 --> 00:34:00,691
... you desired a stranger.
- But that old man can hardly see.

277
00:34:01,001 --> 00:34:04,937
In future he won't even see
this much. In this world...

278
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:07,230
...pious women's husbands
are usually blind.

279
00:34:07,474 --> 00:34:11,410
My beautiful youth
will go wasted.

280
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,410
For six months tie a black horse's
tail, to whatever hair is left.

281
00:34:15,683 --> 00:34:17,275
Won't a white horse do Holiness?

282
00:34:17,451 --> 00:34:21,512
No, the remedy found in a black
horse's tail, is not available...

283
00:34:21,755 --> 00:34:25,088
... in a white horse's tail.
Get rid of all of them princess.

284
00:34:25,392 --> 00:34:27,257
It's time to give you the message.

285
00:34:40,941 --> 00:34:43,068
Please fulfill my dreams Holiness.

286
00:34:44,912 --> 00:34:46,971
Make my life's journey a success.

287
00:34:48,315 --> 00:34:53,582
I am immensely pleased with you.
Today, at midnight when the moon...

288
00:34:53,887 --> 00:34:59,450
... rises from the cliffs in the
east, you' ll hear your lover's call.

289
00:34:59,893 --> 00:35:03,659
Then, If you go towards that
direction, you will see your lover.

290
00:35:03,897 --> 00:35:04,921
Is it true Holiness?

291
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:08,694
My message is over. It's now
time for me to leave.

292
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:35,927
"Two stars are to meet
on earth tonight"

293
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:42,794
"Two stars are to meet
on earth tonight"

294
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:49,969
" My love bears fruit tonight"

295
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:59,049
"The night appears
to be a bride tonight"

296
00:35:59,353 --> 00:36:08,660
"Two stars are to meet
on earth tonight"

297
00:36:27,581 --> 00:36:36,250
"O beautiful one,
I come into your life"

298
00:36:36,557 --> 00:36:45,226
" I long to meet you"

299
00:36:45,566 --> 00:36:54,304
" Do away with the veil tonight"

300
00:36:54,608 --> 00:37:03,676
" For hope smiles upon us tonight"

301
00:37:03,884 --> 00:37:16,319
"Two stars are to meet
on earth tonight"

302
00:37:28,876 --> 00:37:37,909
"The one I longed to meet
is coming over"

303
00:37:38,252 --> 00:37:46,853
" He lays the stars and the Moon
at my feet"

304
00:37:47,294 --> 00:37:56,134
"The skies kiss my feet tonight..."

305
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:03,037
"for the world appears
to be a bride tonight"

306
00:38:03,377 --> 00:38:16,245
"Two stars are to meet
on earth tonight"

307
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:39,923
Gently.

308
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:46,530
You fools you treat a basket of
stones and a bouquet of flowers alike.

309
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:47,992
Go away!

310
00:41:50,168 --> 00:41:53,934
Forgive the humiliation caused
to you by these rustics.

311
00:41:54,339 --> 00:41:57,706
Shut up! If you know what's good
for you, release me at once.

312
00:41:58,009 --> 00:42:02,446
After fulfilling the desire of the
heart, one doesn't want to return it.

313
00:42:02,714 --> 00:42:04,375
Think before you say such things.

314
00:42:04,683 --> 00:42:08,744
I've made this move of life and
death, after a great deal of thought.

315
00:42:09,087 --> 00:42:12,818
I will never retrace my steps.

316
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:15,786
You are worse than I thought.

317
00:42:16,094 --> 00:42:19,325
You've always returned my
love for you with venom.

318
00:42:19,598 --> 00:42:21,623
You deserve only this.

319
00:42:21,933 --> 00:42:24,902
I would have kept on
longing for you like this.

320
00:42:25,203 --> 00:42:27,728
But I cannot bear to see my love
about to be snatched away.

321
00:42:27,973 --> 00:42:30,032
I cannot bear to see you
belonging to someone else.

322
00:42:30,308 --> 00:42:35,041
I have served you and that father
of yours whom the world calls king.

323
00:42:35,347 --> 00:42:37,247
And today you have betrayed the
same king, on whose generosity...

324
00:42:37,515 --> 00:42:38,982
... you have survived.

325
00:42:39,284 --> 00:42:42,014
I have been doing a favor to
that old man who can't stand but...

326
00:42:42,187 --> 00:42:46,123
... sits on the throne like a
piece, on the chess board.

327
00:42:46,424 --> 00:42:50,190
It is I who has been ruling,
and will continue to do so.

328
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:52,962
All the affairs of state
are in my control.

329
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:59,600
My destiny has been decided and
no power on earth can change that.

330
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:05,538
Consider your plight carefully
and then decide.

331
00:43:07,812 --> 00:43:13,341
Keep your best men on guard. We will
have to leave before daybreak.

332
00:43:23,728 --> 00:43:25,696
I've seen many of your type.

333
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:29,959
They stray for a while and
come back on track.

334
00:43:33,038 --> 00:43:36,838
She's crying. Doesn't even speak.

335
00:43:38,843 --> 00:43:44,873
Now she's watching the
pillar, and now the door.

336
00:43:46,351 --> 00:43:49,377
If someone requests me,
l' ll open the door.

337
00:43:58,229 --> 00:44:08,104
It's you!
What's this? You can't

338
00:44:09,007 --> 00:44:11,976
I was resting my head
at my beloved's feet.

339
00:44:12,377 --> 00:44:13,901
How did you come here?

340
00:44:14,412 --> 00:44:18,212
This formal way of talking won't do.
You will have to open up.

341
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,549
All right, then l
will have to leave.

342
00:44:27,325 --> 00:44:31,853
What are you doing in this jungle?
And how did you reach here?

343
00:44:32,197 --> 00:44:37,157
By following your footsteps and
the scent of your hair.

344
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:38,629
Your beautiful eyes....

345
00:44:38,903 --> 00:44:42,896
Softly. We may be heard.
I' m so relieved to see you,...

346
00:44:43,174 --> 00:44:45,506
... otherwise who knows what
that monster would have done.

347
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:47,302
Did you see his guts?

348
00:44:47,746 --> 00:44:52,774
What are you talking about? We are
meeting for the first time...

349
00:44:53,051 --> 00:44:58,318
I've met you a million times and had
long talks with you in my heart.

350
00:44:59,424 --> 00:45:01,324
You are a big liar.

351
00:45:01,726 --> 00:45:03,785
If I lie to you,
may I drop dead.

352
00:45:04,829 --> 00:45:07,024
That too will be my loss.

353
00:45:08,466 --> 00:45:10,366
But I don't even know you.

354
00:45:10,668 --> 00:45:14,798
Even when I hadn't meet you, I had
showered my love on your picture.

355
00:45:20,111 --> 00:45:26,448
What all I had thought. How I would
meet you and appear before you.

356
00:45:26,785 --> 00:45:31,222
Even though you are here now, but
still my hands are not trembling.

357
00:45:31,523 --> 00:45:33,753
Only my heart is beating loudly.

358
00:45:35,827 --> 00:45:39,354
What are you staring at?
Is this any time to talk?

359
00:45:39,731 --> 00:45:41,028
Who's talking?

360
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:43,857
- Then do something fast.
- Do what fast?

361
00:45:44,169 --> 00:45:47,969
Think of a way to get out, otherwise
that criminal will take me away.

362
00:45:48,273 --> 00:45:51,868
You think he' ll take you away, while
I sit and watch in that corner?

363
00:45:52,143 --> 00:45:54,703
Then do something quick.

364
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:01,778
You must know that you
are very beautiful.

365
00:46:03,488 --> 00:46:06,355
You wait here. I' ll return
after making arrangements.

366
00:46:07,992 --> 00:46:09,186
Someone is coming.

367
00:46:55,807 --> 00:47:01,143
Well done. I' ll just come back.

368
00:48:24,095 --> 00:48:25,323
Who are you?

369
00:48:25,964 --> 00:48:27,431
Walk towards the light.

370
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:04,390
What happened?
- l' m terrified. They' re still stirring.

371
00:49:05,737 --> 00:49:07,432
These mosquitoes are
troubling me.

372
00:49:07,605 --> 00:49:10,039
You are worried about
the mosquitoes. Come on now.

373
00:49:10,608 --> 00:49:11,597
Who is that?

374
00:49:11,876 --> 00:49:14,003
The commander in chief.
He had a sword in hand so...

375
00:49:14,212 --> 00:49:15,474
... I settled him....

376
00:49:16,814 --> 00:49:20,250
- Someone is coming.
- Let them come, l' ll take care.

377
00:49:24,289 --> 00:49:27,156
Pick up the rod.

378
00:50:44,268 --> 00:50:52,801
" Love has cast a spell...
in the beautiful garden of roses"

379
00:50:53,077 --> 00:50:56,706
" Love has cast a spell..."

380
00:50:57,048 --> 00:51:01,951
" in the beautiful garden of roses
is the emerald fairy"

381
00:51:11,963 --> 00:51:16,229
" I no longer fear the assassin"

382
00:51:16,567 --> 00:51:22,403
" My journey is now easy"

383
00:51:24,942 --> 00:51:29,174
" I no longer fear the assassin"

384
00:51:29,447 --> 00:51:33,213
" My journey is now easy"

385
00:51:33,484 --> 00:51:37,181
" I new dream I see..."

386
00:51:37,522 --> 00:51:41,822
" in which the world
belongs to us"

387
00:51:43,795 --> 00:51:47,959
" I new dream I see..."

388
00:51:48,266 --> 00:51:52,202
" in which the world
belongs to us"

389
00:51:56,374 --> 00:52:01,038
" A world of love we have"

390
00:52:02,013 --> 00:52:05,107
" A world of love we have"

391
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:09,511
" Love has cast a spell..."

392
00:52:09,654 --> 00:52:14,284
" in the rose-gardens
is the emerald fairy"

393
00:52:26,237 --> 00:52:30,401
" We' re love-birds"

394
00:52:30,775 --> 00:52:35,041
" Nobody can't predict our course"

395
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:42,477
" We' re love-birds"

396
00:52:48,256 --> 00:52:49,450
Sleeping?

397
00:52:50,659 --> 00:52:53,093
No, l' m dreaming while awake.

398
00:52:54,362 --> 00:52:55,829
What are you dreaming?

399
00:52:58,233 --> 00:53:05,867
Its night, a gentle breeze
is blowing and...

400
00:53:06,208 --> 00:53:11,373
I' m resting my head on a beautiful
lady's shoulder and dreaming.

401
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,176
- I always knew....
- What?

402
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,683
That I can't trust you.

403
00:53:21,356 --> 00:53:25,417
- That girl said the same thing.
- What thing?

404
00:53:25,694 --> 00:53:28,185
That she couldn't trust me.

405
00:53:29,064 --> 00:53:32,625
Why does she imitate me?
Tell her to say something else.

406
00:53:38,106 --> 00:53:40,370
- Let's go from here.
- Where?

407
00:53:40,709 --> 00:53:41,971
Anywhere.

408
00:53:42,944 --> 00:53:46,072
On our separate routes?
- No, together.

409
00:53:46,414 --> 00:53:48,974
- Always?
- Always.

410
00:53:49,251 --> 00:53:52,118
- Is that a promise?
- Yes...

411
00:55:21,242 --> 00:55:24,336
I had warned you not to send the
princess on that dangerous route...

412
00:55:24,579 --> 00:55:26,376
... without my protection.

413
00:55:26,982 --> 00:55:32,249
But you listened to your daughter
and what we had feared has happened.

414
00:55:32,654 --> 00:55:37,091
I cannot bear this terrible loss,
and I seek your help.

415
00:55:37,659 --> 00:55:40,492
Bring back my daughter
at any cost.

416
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:44,458
Don't worry Your Highness, my
men are searching every corner.

417
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:49,461
Announce that we will give a huge
reward to anyone who finds her.

418
00:55:55,610 --> 00:56:00,946
The state has declared that
whoever finds the princess...

419
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:06,413
... will get a reward of fifty
thousand rupees.

420
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:09,949
Fifty thousand!

421
00:56:54,069 --> 00:56:55,536
You came to do battle?

422
00:56:55,970 --> 00:57:01,533
I' m going in search of the princess.
I' ll earn fifty thousand.

423
00:57:01,843 --> 00:57:04,073
Bless me Sir.

424
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,044
God give him wisdom.

425
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:11,780
What will I do with wisdom?

426
00:57:11,986 --> 00:57:15,513
Just bless me.

427
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:18,691
- Please bless me.
- Never.

428
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:25,563
Then give me a gentle push.
- All right, here you go!

429
00:58:04,906 --> 00:58:12,403
The throne cannot be kept vacant.
We' ll have to crown your son.

430
00:58:12,647 --> 00:58:17,346
For God's sake don't push my son into
this sin. It will be an injustice.

431
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:21,385
No. Your son is the prince's
closest friend and like his brother.

432
00:58:21,689 --> 00:58:24,385
Do you wish that a brother
should betray his own brother?

433
00:58:24,659 --> 00:58:27,492
Then what shall we do?
Even his dead body hasn't been found...

434
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:30,958
which I could place on the throne.
Shall I place his shoes there?

435
00:58:31,232 --> 00:58:34,224
Yes. It's been done
before in our country.

436
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:39,266
You fool! The throne
cannot remain empty.

437
00:58:39,707 --> 00:58:45,168
I' ll search my son myself,
in every corner.

438
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:52,777
Even at the cost
of my own life.

439
00:58:53,054 --> 00:58:55,420
Wait mother, l' ll come with you.

440
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:06,364
Father he still hasn't
regained consciousness.

441
00:59:07,569 --> 00:59:09,560
Send for the
physician again.

442
00:59:09,904 --> 00:59:16,537
His life is now in God's hands.
You rest, you must be tired.

443
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:20,837
You sleep father. I' ll sit here.

444
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:55,846
I've always served You, Lord.
And showered flowers on You.

445
00:59:56,417 --> 01:00:01,821
I've seen a smile on
Your lips so often.

446
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,552
I have never asked You for anything.

447
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:14,160
Today I've come to seek help.
Make him well.

448
01:00:20,775 --> 01:00:22,140
Princess!

449
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:28,114
You cannot take me alive.
Your strength and crimes...

450
01:00:28,383 --> 01:00:30,351
... cannot enslave my love.

451
01:00:31,786 --> 01:00:36,155
You mean person, l' m going to
a place where I will...

452
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:40,485
... always be protected from
your evil designs.

453
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,755
Listen, it's possible that your
love can bring your lover here.

454
01:00:45,066 --> 01:00:48,934
Go on, if you wish to escape after
deceiving this test of love.

455
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:53,104
That means he is alive?
- Yes, he's waiting for you.

456
01:00:56,744 --> 01:00:57,836
Where is he?

457
01:00:58,179 --> 01:01:00,238
He's in the room from
which you have came.

458
01:01:08,389 --> 01:01:12,951
Sir, your plan hasn't worked.
I had told you already.

459
01:01:13,261 --> 01:01:18,893
You were right. Love birds
cannot be treated harshly.

460
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:23,261
Let's trap this butterfly
with kindness and patience.

461
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:29,970
Transform this quiet fort into
Heaven. Light candles everywhere.

462
01:01:30,278 --> 01:01:32,974
Fill this place with music,
and from every corner,...

463
01:01:33,281 --> 01:01:35,715
...Iet there be sounds of the
tinkling of bells and anklets. Go.

464
01:02:17,058 --> 01:02:18,923
You seem very happy.

465
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,988
I' m rejoicing at
your getting well.

466
01:02:23,965 --> 01:02:31,428
One mustn't rejoice so openly. What do
you keep seeking from God everyday?

467
01:02:31,773 --> 01:02:35,004
Nothing now. I've received
what I had asked for.

468
01:02:35,276 --> 01:02:38,473
He really listens to you.
I've also served God a lot.

469
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:42,181
Then request something for me too.
- What?

470
01:02:42,917 --> 01:02:50,119
Ask God to send me that lady with
black tresses, and the gait of a dear.

471
01:02:50,458 --> 01:02:52,619
Why ask for what
you already have?

472
01:02:53,961 --> 01:02:55,189
What is this for?

473
01:02:56,030 --> 01:03:00,524
The Lord has granted my wish.
Before I make a request...

474
01:03:00,868 --> 01:03:03,564
...on your behalf, He has made my
promise given to him, come true.

475
01:03:03,805 --> 01:03:10,267
I had promised God, that when you
get well these feet will once...

476
01:03:10,511 --> 01:03:12,445
... again dance to your notes.

477
01:03:13,648 --> 01:03:18,813
Once again my heart will be
immersed in my old dreams.

478
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:27,550
But l' m lost in a dream world
where there is everlasting peace.

479
01:03:27,862 --> 01:03:31,229
Where melodies of love
played once, never stop.

480
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:38,732
Turn your dreams into reality.
Strike the notes, l' m with you.

481
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:38,822
"O Magician..."

482
01:04:39,033 --> 01:04:41,900
"you have my heart"

483
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:44,433
" Fill my heart with love..."

484
01:04:44,705 --> 01:04:49,005
" I implore you in the name
of your youth"

485
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:56,039
" O Magician..."

486
01:04:56,284 --> 01:05:00,550
"you have my heart"

487
01:05:00,821 --> 01:05:03,119
" Fill my heart with love..."

488
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:07,555
" I implore you in the name
of your youth"

489
01:05:29,684 --> 01:05:34,178
" From my heart flow
the song and melody..."

490
01:05:34,455 --> 01:05:38,221
"the wonderful climes
are all for me"

491
01:05:41,495 --> 01:05:45,693
" From my heart flow
the song and melody..."

492
01:05:45,967 --> 01:05:49,664
"the wonderful climes
are all for me"

493
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:54,803
" A spell, I will cast.
I will sing and dance"

494
01:05:55,142 --> 01:05:58,942
" For you, I will give up the world"

495
01:06:02,183 --> 01:06:06,517
" A spell, I will cast.
I will sing and dance"

496
01:06:06,854 --> 01:06:10,620
" For you, I will give up the world"

497
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:15,488
"O Magician..."

498
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:20,096
"you have my heart"

499
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:22,527
" Fill my heart with love..."

500
01:06:22,837 --> 01:06:27,240
" I implore you in the name
of your youth"

501
01:06:44,191 --> 01:06:48,457
"The melodies of life,
and the moonlight..."

502
01:06:48,763 --> 01:06:52,893
" I am because you are, my love"

503
01:06:54,735 --> 01:06:59,001
"The melodies of life,
and the moonlight..."

504
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:03,106
" I am because you are, my love"

505
01:07:03,778 --> 01:07:08,112
" A spell, I will cast.
I will sing and dance"

506
01:07:08,516 --> 01:07:12,316
" For you, I will give up
the world, my love"

507
01:07:15,423 --> 01:07:19,917
" A spell, I will cast.
I will sing and dance"

508
01:07:20,261 --> 01:07:23,958
" For you, I will give up
the world, my love"

509
01:07:26,934 --> 01:07:28,799
"O Magician..."

510
01:07:29,103 --> 01:07:33,472
"you have my heart"

511
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:35,866
" Fill my heart with love..."

512
01:07:36,143 --> 01:07:40,512
" I implore you in the name
of your youth"

513
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:47,411
"O Magician..."

514
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:51,647
"you have my heart"

515
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:54,153
" Fill my heart with love..."

516
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:58,795
" I implore you in the name
of your youth"

517
01:09:13,856 --> 01:09:18,350
This precious necklace is for
you from the commander-in-chief.

518
01:09:18,695 --> 01:09:20,663
He has asked for you.

519
01:09:21,197 --> 01:09:24,189
It's my good fortune.
What does he wish?

520
01:09:26,436 --> 01:09:31,840
A withered flower has to be
revived with your special talents.

521
01:09:32,108 --> 01:09:34,736
A withered flower? I don't follow.

522
01:09:35,378 --> 01:09:38,939
I cannot say anything more.
You will to come there.

523
01:09:39,248 --> 01:09:42,547
- I cannot go.
- Why not?

524
01:09:46,723 --> 01:09:53,094
I too cannot explain.
Dancer, you will be

525
01:09:53,396 --> 01:09:56,331
God has given me more than that.

526
01:10:00,603 --> 01:10:01,934
The commander-in-chief's man.

527
01:10:02,739 --> 01:10:08,837
- Why didn't you go?
- I have a guest at my house.

528
01:10:09,212 --> 01:10:13,581
- Who can this withered flower be?
- I don't know.

529
01:10:14,017 --> 01:10:15,780
Where does the commander-in-chief
stay?

530
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:21,313
In the old fort of Rajgarh.

531
01:10:25,862 --> 01:10:28,330
- Where are you going?
- I have to go.

532
01:10:31,334 --> 01:10:33,700
Have I offended you unknowingly?

533
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:37,906
No, l' m deeply indebted to you.
I' ll never forget you.

534
01:10:42,045 --> 01:10:43,603
Take me along.

535
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:47,144
Don't worry, God is with me.

536
01:10:47,483 --> 01:10:50,577
When will you return?

537
01:10:51,254 --> 01:10:55,418
I can't say. But I will
surely meet you once again.

538
01:11:16,446 --> 01:11:19,279
Greetings holy man.

539
01:11:19,615 --> 01:11:20,081
What do you wish?

540
01:11:20,349 --> 01:11:24,683
Nothing now. The flute player
has found the drummer.

541
01:11:27,423 --> 01:11:29,186
It's you?

542
01:11:33,296 --> 01:11:35,161
Where is your pilgrimage going?

543
01:11:35,565 --> 01:11:41,595
In search of the princess.
My heart is most unsteady.

544
01:11:41,838 --> 01:11:43,328
Is it for the reward?

545
01:11:43,639 --> 01:11:46,608
Do you think l' ll waste
my time otherwise?

546
01:11:47,977 --> 01:11:52,277
Has your search led
to any clues?

547
01:11:52,682 --> 01:11:58,814
Yes it did. These walls have
let me down in my search.

548
01:11:59,088 --> 01:12:00,851
Not a window is left open.

549
01:12:36,492 --> 01:12:40,121
Go away. Stay away from me!

550
01:13:06,956 --> 01:13:09,288
- Jayadev.
- If you order....

551
01:13:09,659 --> 01:13:15,928
No, My dreams cannot be shattered
like this. She has to live.

552
01:13:16,232 --> 01:13:19,633
Sir, she has fainted from
fear of you, and loneliness.

553
01:13:19,936 --> 01:13:21,995
- We have found the solution.
- What is it?

554
01:13:23,206 --> 01:13:27,404
Being deeply in love, she needs
the fragrance of flowers...

555
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:32,204
... and soft notes of music
which will cure her affliction.

556
01:13:32,582 --> 01:13:36,018
- But where is all this?
- All this is here at your doorstep.

557
01:13:43,993 --> 01:13:45,017
Who are you?

558
01:13:45,361 --> 01:13:48,990
My father's name was
Himalaya Singh Gangotri...

559
01:13:49,232 --> 01:13:52,099
and I am Bindyachal
Narmada Prasad.

560
01:13:52,435 --> 01:13:53,959
I want to know
what is your profession?

561
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:57,171
I am an expert of
the nuances of the throat.

562
01:14:02,511 --> 01:14:04,775
All these classical notes,
I can sing well. Listen....

563
01:14:07,149 --> 01:14:07,979
Turn him out.

564
01:14:08,484 --> 01:14:13,148
Sir, listen to me with
the accompaniment of music.

565
01:14:16,158 --> 01:14:17,352
Who are you?

566
01:14:17,526 --> 01:14:21,792
I am the last son of the great
music teacher Bhairon Singh.

567
01:14:22,098 --> 01:14:26,159
I can drill a hole in the ceiling,
with the simplest of music notes.

568
01:14:26,435 --> 01:14:27,834
And you make a hole in the sky
with one of the long notes!

569
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:28,866
Yes Sir.

570
01:14:29,005 --> 01:14:32,532
In fact the rain falls through
those very holes.

571
01:14:32,942 --> 01:14:36,742
Just give me a chance, sir.

572
01:14:38,481 --> 01:14:39,641
Throw him out!

573
01:14:40,049 --> 01:14:44,418
That was only a sample Sir.
I have many more....

574
01:14:48,658 --> 01:14:52,890
- What are you suffering from?
- l' m ill myself. See.

575
01:14:56,132 --> 01:15:02,298
My father and I used to sell
donkeys. We lost money there.

576
01:15:02,505 --> 01:15:03,665
Have you come to buy donkeys?

577
01:15:03,939 --> 01:15:05,338
- Yes Sir.
- What did you say?

578
01:15:05,608 --> 01:15:09,203
I didn't mean that. I' m carrying
my master's musical instrument.

579
01:15:09,545 --> 01:15:10,603
Which master?

580
01:15:10,913 --> 01:15:15,543
Who has mastered melodies like
Jaijawanti, Todi, Jhanjhoti.

581
01:15:25,661 --> 01:15:27,822
I have brought this instrument who has
excelled in all nuances of music.

582
01:15:28,130 --> 01:15:30,030
What good is just bringing
the musical instrument, you idiot!

583
01:15:30,232 --> 01:15:33,565
Listen Sir, I don't object
to a pure abuse,...

584
01:15:33,969 --> 01:15:36,335
but I will not tolerate
an impure one.

585
01:15:36,706 --> 01:15:39,698
I may be an untouchable,
but times have changed.

586
01:15:40,042 --> 01:15:44,979
You will see the magic of this
instrument at the stroke of midnight.

587
01:15:45,348 --> 01:15:50,217
When the moon appears and
with the beat of music,

588
01:15:50,486 --> 01:15:54,980
withered flowers will start to
blossom just like comely girls.

589
01:15:55,558 --> 01:15:58,994
Sad and detached souls
will begin to seek love.

590
01:16:01,464 --> 01:16:05,594
- What if this does not happen?
- Then cut off my head.

591
01:17:03,626 --> 01:17:05,958
My teacher, where are you?

592
01:17:16,071 --> 01:17:26,470
Don't sir, don't!

593
01:17:29,701 --> 01:17:42,808
" Love spreads its wings"

594
01:17:43,582 --> 01:17:51,853
" And I come to you"

595
01:17:52,190 --> 01:18:02,498
" I am not in control
of myself anymore"

596
01:18:02,934 --> 01:18:13,242
"This crazy heart
cries out for you"

597
01:18:24,056 --> 01:18:29,392
"Open the doors to your heart..."

598
01:18:29,661 --> 01:18:32,186
"your beloved is at your doorstep"

599
01:18:32,764 --> 01:18:36,291
" Open the doors to your heart..."

600
01:18:36,601 --> 01:18:39,764
"your beloved is at your doorstep"

601
01:18:40,172 --> 01:18:47,738
" Your beloved is at your doorstep"

602
01:18:58,356 --> 01:19:03,623
"On the night of separation..."

603
01:19:03,829 --> 01:19:09,096
" I walked aimlessly
through your lanes"

604
01:19:11,369 --> 01:19:21,267
" Your beloved took the guise
of a mendicant..."

605
01:19:21,546 --> 01:19:28,543
"so listen to me, O fair one.
Your beloved is at your doorstep"

606
01:19:28,987 --> 01:19:36,120
" Your love, your beloved,
is at your doorstep"

607
01:19:46,972 --> 01:19:59,646
" You must meet your beloved today"

608
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:14,455
"The secrets of your heart,
nobody knows"

609
01:20:14,733 --> 01:20:21,901
"So dance with joy, O fair one...
your beloved is at your doorstep"

610
01:20:23,308 --> 01:20:29,804
" Your lover, your beloved,
is at your doorstep"

611
01:20:40,358 --> 01:20:50,256
" Lest things are ruined,
do not lose your nerve"

612
01:20:52,904 --> 01:21:02,302
" Luck smiles now...
so what do you regret?"

613
01:21:02,581 --> 01:21:06,415
" Your life is precious..."

614
01:21:06,685 --> 01:21:09,654
"and your beloved is
at your doorstep"

615
01:21:10,021 --> 01:21:17,257
"Open the doors to your heart...
your beloved is at your doorstep"

616
01:21:17,629 --> 01:21:24,159
" Your lover, your beloved,
is at your doorstep"

617
01:21:30,274 --> 01:21:34,005
You can't be him!

618
01:21:42,553 --> 01:21:53,987
The great musician, Kohinoor.

619
01:21:54,265 --> 01:21:58,133
I, his disciple, pay my respects.

620
01:21:58,436 --> 01:22:03,601
Please kneel down.
Rise.

621
01:22:05,243 --> 01:22:12,740
What is this? In my absence,
my dear girl has become so unhappy?

622
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:16,383
She is like a fish
without water.

623
01:22:16,687 --> 01:22:23,820
... and wisdom, and drown you.

624
01:22:24,095 --> 01:22:27,826
As you wish my Lord. But drown
him also along with me.

625
01:22:28,132 --> 01:22:31,465
Yes Holiness, drown me too.
I' m greatly troubled.

626
01:22:31,869 --> 01:22:36,238
- His life is very complicated.
- It's my fortune that you are here.

627
01:22:36,574 --> 01:22:44,572
The life of a sage, saint, a priest,
is like a flowing fragrance.

628
01:22:44,849 --> 01:22:47,784
That is why, I don't
stay in one place.

629
01:22:48,052 --> 01:22:51,783
Please stay, it will give
us a lease of life.

630
01:22:51,856 --> 01:22:55,451
You are a mere mortal and
I am a disciple of God.

631
01:22:56,160 --> 01:23:03,089
I tell everyone how the
world was created.

632
01:23:03,401 --> 01:23:05,198
I know when a person is unhappy,
cold water is the answer.

633
01:23:05,503 --> 01:23:06,663
I cannot stay here.

634
01:23:06,971 --> 01:23:11,670
Have pity, Holiness, and stay on.
Don't disappoint us.

635
01:23:11,942 --> 01:23:17,346
Troubled hearts cannot find
answers in this manner.

636
01:23:17,548 --> 01:23:19,448
Please, your holiness.

637
01:23:22,987 --> 01:23:26,013
A lover's problems and
all the worries,...

638
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:30,554
... can never be smooth.

639
01:23:32,997 --> 01:23:35,693
But your hopes and
your worries, both will end.

640
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,594
What are these powers Holiness?

641
01:23:38,869 --> 01:23:43,397
They belong to the family
of those who are in love.

642
01:23:43,607 --> 01:23:50,706
Who with their uncertainty and terror
spoil the lives of the lovers.

643
01:23:51,015 --> 01:23:55,714
I won't let you go my Lord.
I' ll die at your feet.

644
01:23:56,053 --> 01:24:01,753
Ignorant boy, don't make
your grave at my feet.

645
01:24:02,326 --> 01:24:06,092
My ocean of mercy within
me has been stirred.

646
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:07,490
Let it stir My Lord.

647
01:24:07,765 --> 01:24:11,292
Against my wish I will stay
at this hut of yours...

648
01:24:11,602 --> 01:24:18,337
...for three days and through my
powers, l' ll remove your troubles.

649
01:24:18,609 --> 01:24:21,635
- My child!
- Yes my Lord.

650
01:24:25,883 --> 01:24:30,479
Early tomorrow morning, in the
presence of the princess,...

651
01:24:30,788 --> 01:24:40,026
...we will have to recite the sacred
words, so as to make her accessible.

652
01:25:01,919 --> 01:25:04,581
Look into the flower. It holds a
secret telling you how to escape.

653
01:25:19,770 --> 01:25:21,704
Concentrate on the flower.

654
01:25:22,072 --> 01:25:24,040
You do that!

655
01:25:25,209 --> 01:25:33,048
- You concentrate on the flower.
- You do that.

656
01:25:41,425 --> 01:25:43,086
Get out from here.

657
01:25:52,803 --> 01:25:54,361
I will break your head.

658
01:25:57,208 --> 01:25:59,199
Bravo commander-in-chief!

659
01:25:59,810 --> 01:26:06,113
You very bravely faced the first
attack, of this war of love!

660
01:26:06,617 --> 01:26:11,680
This red blood is the
sign of your victory.

661
01:26:12,089 --> 01:26:16,219
Go out, you don't have the
strength to bear another attack!

662
01:26:24,168 --> 01:26:29,299
Shut the door with your
wounded hands my friend.

663
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:35,303
A person should act wisely.
Such a tall, strong man,...

664
01:26:35,479 --> 01:26:40,507
...with so much pride,
having such long moustaches,...

665
01:26:40,718 --> 01:26:44,245
... should have been
handled carefully, my girl.

666
01:26:44,555 --> 01:26:51,358
Grab him with both hands. You won't
find such a handsome man again.

667
01:26:51,695 --> 01:26:54,562
Remember girl,
if you fail this time...

668
01:26:54,865 --> 01:27:04,638
for the rest of your life you will
be suffering, and selling peanuts.

669
01:27:16,754 --> 01:27:18,346
Be careful sir.

670
01:27:19,290 --> 01:27:24,284
Be calm, be calm.
I' ll get hurt.

671
01:27:24,461 --> 01:27:26,793
Go away from here.
Take this!

672
01:27:27,565 --> 01:27:32,593
I' ll give a curse and
you will perish.

673
01:27:33,804 --> 01:27:36,796
Don't you dare!

674
01:28:12,076 --> 01:28:15,341
No doubt you would have
recognized me, princess.

675
01:28:15,613 --> 01:28:19,174
Certainly Your Holiness. But
after a lot of suffering.

676
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:20,983
My moustache....

677
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:30,053
Sir, get up....

678
01:28:35,232 --> 01:28:38,133
What did you say?
Say that again.

679
01:28:39,937 --> 01:28:43,703
What is there to say?
With you, I've got back my life.

680
01:28:43,974 --> 01:28:46,465
What is this? Look up.

681
01:28:48,979 --> 01:28:52,471
Does one shed tears after
getting back one's life?

682
01:28:54,051 --> 01:28:56,315
These are tears of happiness.

683
01:29:05,062 --> 01:29:10,591
What happened to him.
- Nothing. He's wounded in love.

684
01:29:20,511 --> 01:29:22,138
Where is my beard?

685
01:29:24,114 --> 01:29:27,106
Water....

686
01:29:28,886 --> 01:29:33,255
- He's a nice fellow.
- Where is he?

687
01:29:34,658 --> 01:29:37,593
Its a great insult
commander in chief.

688
01:29:37,795 --> 01:29:38,921
Your Holiness....

689
01:29:39,229 --> 01:29:44,826
Problems of you two
lovers has destroyed me.

690
01:29:45,135 --> 01:29:48,764
My peace of mind is disturbed.

691
01:29:49,606 --> 01:29:55,636
Get a whip. I' ll treat that
proud girl a lesson.

692
01:29:55,913 --> 01:29:57,505
- No Holiness.
- Shut up!

693
01:30:54,905 --> 01:31:00,070
Holiness, your actions
have made me think.

694
01:31:02,446 --> 01:31:09,545
Man's second name, is 'confusion
in the face of difficulties'.

695
01:31:09,853 --> 01:31:14,881
Do the eyes see?
Most certainly!

696
01:31:15,092 --> 01:31:18,027
Why do they see? What do they see?
Who do they see?

697
01:31:18,295 --> 01:31:21,059
These are the things
to ponder my friend.

698
01:31:21,465 --> 01:31:25,902
But how to awaken the feeling
of love in a stubborn,...

699
01:31:26,170 --> 01:31:32,109
hard hearted girl?
Do you know that?

700
01:31:32,309 --> 01:31:34,971
By beating and whipping her!

701
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:40,077
I notice that you are losing
faith in my powers.

702
01:31:40,417 --> 01:31:43,443
Your mind has become confused
and suspicious.

703
01:31:43,787 --> 01:31:45,755
You are right Holiness.

704
01:31:47,124 --> 01:31:54,553
Lord above, you cannot trust
a mortal in this world!

705
01:31:54,865 --> 01:31:59,131
I trusted you fully and saw
the result with my own eyes.

706
01:31:59,469 --> 01:32:06,432
Shame on you! With my good intentions,
I made your barren heart...

707
01:32:06,677 --> 01:32:10,704
become receptive to accept
someone's love...

708
01:32:10,914 --> 01:32:13,883
... and this is how you
show your gratitude,...

709
01:32:14,151 --> 01:32:19,248
- I need proof Holiness.
- Are you doubting my intentions?

710
01:32:19,690 --> 01:32:22,181
- You are testing my powers?
- Yes.

711
01:32:22,359 --> 01:32:23,951
- You want proof from me?
- Yes.

712
01:32:24,194 --> 01:32:26,458
You will certainly get proof.

713
01:32:27,631 --> 01:32:32,295
'The sound of melodious notes
to the call of the master'

714
01:32:32,536 --> 01:32:37,735
'Salutations to Love.
Let their be a miracle!'

715
01:32:37,975 --> 01:32:41,035
- Present yourself, my disciple
- l' m here master.

716
01:32:44,314 --> 01:32:47,078
You play the notes, and l' ll sing.

717
01:33:08,405 --> 01:33:43,198
" In my heart,
I hear the music of love"

718
01:33:43,473 --> 01:33:50,345
" With his arrival,
my loneliness disappears"

719
01:33:50,614 --> 01:33:58,248
" In my heart,
I hear the music of love"

720
01:34:07,965 --> 01:34:12,868
"Grief is now a thing of the past;
l' m delighted"

721
01:34:15,372 --> 01:34:20,241
"The world comes alive,
and roses blossom"

722
01:34:22,512 --> 01:34:27,245
"Grief is now a thing of the past;
l' m delighted"

723
01:34:27,517 --> 01:34:32,352
"The world comes alive,
and roses blossom"

724
01:34:37,461 --> 01:34:42,797
" My heart rejoices..."

725
01:34:44,868 --> 01:34:51,899
"for he is here and
my loneliness is gone"

726
01:34:52,209 --> 01:34:59,706
" In my heart,
I hear the music of love"

727
01:35:14,464 --> 01:35:24,237
" Meeting him is so much of fun"

728
01:35:26,543 --> 01:35:29,706
"The days and the nights,
all belong to me..."

729
01:35:29,946 --> 01:35:31,436
"why must I be scared
of anything now?"

730
01:35:31,681 --> 01:35:34,275
"The days and the nights,
all belong to me..."

731
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:39,145
"why must I be scared
of anything now?"

732
01:35:44,194 --> 01:35:49,257
" Happiness walks with me"

733
01:35:51,101 --> 01:35:58,337
" He has arrived and
my loneliness has disappeared"

734
01:35:58,642 --> 01:36:05,741
" In my heart, I hear
the music of love"

735
01:36:27,838 --> 01:36:37,270
"On my lips are
songs of love"

736
01:36:39,749 --> 01:36:49,454
" Yet another secret my heart hides"

737
01:36:54,431 --> 01:37:01,394
" Nobody will understand
the deep-rooted secret"

738
01:37:01,638 --> 01:37:08,601
" He is here and my
loneliness is no more"

739
01:37:08,845 --> 01:37:16,308
" In my heart,
I hear the music of love"

740
01:37:17,969 --> 01:37:21,427
Holiness, I believe you now.

741
01:37:25,043 --> 01:37:27,307
Your favors have won me over.

742
01:37:31,449 --> 01:37:34,543
The stone will melt.
It will melt.

743
01:37:34,819 --> 01:37:38,482
Yes of course.

744
01:38:19,330 --> 01:38:25,269
... great acclaim in your art,
your feet have become unsteady.

745
01:38:25,603 --> 01:38:31,337
A dancer's feet move with her heart.
My heart is sad, father.

746
01:38:31,643 --> 01:38:33,941
You are in the presence of God,
you fool.

747
01:38:34,312 --> 01:38:36,439
Happiness and sorrow
is given by him.

748
01:38:36,748 --> 01:38:40,309
He was testing you before giving
you a boon of this talent.

749
01:38:40,585 --> 01:38:41,882
Seek His forgiveness.

750
01:38:47,792 --> 01:38:53,731
You want to see a smile on
these lips my Lord. You know...

751
01:38:53,965 --> 01:38:56,490
... how to give love, but You
don't know the pain of love.

752
01:38:59,804 --> 01:39:03,001
I' m placing my anklets at Your feet.

753
01:39:04,742 --> 01:39:06,710
If You wish to hear them...

754
01:39:08,446 --> 01:39:10,937
... you will have to heal the
pain in my heart.

755
01:39:15,553 --> 01:39:19,649
Your holiness, at least
wear this beard.

756
01:39:20,124 --> 01:39:21,819
If someone should
see you, you' ll be finished.

757
01:39:22,093 --> 01:39:26,462
To romance with a beard on, is
very strange. She' ll get frightened.

758
01:39:26,764 --> 01:39:30,495
Why worry about her?
Just look after yourself.

759
01:39:30,802 --> 01:39:35,830
Your getting caught, will mean the
end of my fifty thousand rupees.

760
01:39:36,241 --> 01:39:41,543
Patience. Follow the
flow of the tide.

761
01:39:41,846 --> 01:39:48,183
- Turn towards the wall.
- All right.

762
01:40:07,605 --> 01:40:12,668
The passages here are strange.
I had so much problem getting here.

763
01:40:13,378 --> 01:40:15,369
- Are you worried?
- No.

764
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:18,849
- How are you?
- And you?

765
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:22,610
It's a long story, but do
you have the time to listen?

766
01:40:22,987 --> 01:40:26,923
I' ll keep listening, but you
may get lost while talking.

767
01:40:30,228 --> 01:40:31,957
- Someone is coming.
- l' ll see.

768
01:40:34,332 --> 01:40:38,291
Are you well?
Will you have some milk?

769
01:40:38,636 --> 01:40:39,660
Milk?

770
01:40:44,242 --> 01:40:49,111
I had just brought it.
I' ll get another glass.

771
01:40:55,687 --> 01:40:58,315
Nothing. Go.

772
01:41:00,091 --> 01:41:02,491
- Just listen.
- What?

773
01:41:05,530 --> 01:41:09,057
Shut the door after you. Go!

774
01:41:17,342 --> 01:41:19,503
My heart is trembling with fright.

775
01:41:20,545 --> 01:41:22,877
I thought you had already given
away your heart to me.

776
01:41:23,181 --> 01:41:25,308
Keep quiet, I can't
stand your pranks.

777
01:41:25,550 --> 01:41:27,347
Do you realize what will
happen if we get caught?

778
01:41:27,652 --> 01:41:29,643
Then I would
had got beaten up.

779
01:45:53,851 --> 01:45:57,548
Fly away you bird, the
hunter is approaching.

780
01:45:57,788 --> 01:46:00,586
Hurry up, and fly away.

781
01:46:01,058 --> 01:46:01,956
Go away soon.

782
01:46:12,069 --> 01:46:14,970
Blood, master there's blood.

783
01:46:27,184 --> 01:46:33,783
Wait, don't go there, otherwise the
master's meditation will be disturbed.

784
01:46:34,058 --> 01:46:36,185
Go away, or His Holiness
will put a curse on you.

785
01:46:36,927 --> 01:46:41,626
and how does breath from your nose
enter and leave your body?

786
01:46:41,899 --> 01:46:50,500
... from heaven to earth, and
again from earth to heaven

787
01:46:51,208 --> 01:46:54,177
Rejoice commander-in-chief,
your struggle is over.

788
01:46:54,445 --> 01:46:56,675
How is that? Tell me.

789
01:46:57,982 --> 01:47:01,577
They are listening. Follow me.

790
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:06,822
Please tell me what happened?
Please tell me.

791
01:47:07,391 --> 01:47:19,735
As you desired, the princess' heart has
softened, with my special blessing.

792
01:47:20,337 --> 01:47:27,903
The sky has been pierced. As a
result it will rain love tonight.

793
01:47:28,312 --> 01:47:29,836
Holiness, I did not follow.

794
01:47:31,348 --> 01:47:34,749
It is the princess' desire...

795
01:47:35,119 --> 01:47:39,783
that there should be a glittering
gathering tonight.

796
01:47:40,024 --> 01:47:41,491
Really?

797
01:47:41,726 --> 01:47:42,556
In which she will sing
her special melody.

798
01:47:42,727 --> 01:47:43,489
What did you say?

799
01:47:43,828 --> 01:47:47,355
And in that melody I will accompany
her with my purest form of music.

800
01:47:47,598 --> 01:47:50,465
- Purest form of music.
- Yes.

801
01:47:50,668 --> 01:47:54,900
The winds will do a classical
dance and the stars and moon...

802
01:47:55,172 --> 01:47:58,869
... will play the instruments.

803
01:48:36,814 --> 01:48:44,778
" He's wants to wipe out love.
He does not understand"

804
01:48:45,089 --> 01:48:55,090
" l' m afraid to even
utter the word love..."

805
01:48:57,935 --> 01:49:07,105
"for they stand vigil"

806
01:49:09,713 --> 01:49:17,347
" When Cupid strikes...
what will happen of desires?"

807
01:49:17,588 --> 01:49:25,927
" When Cupid strikes...
what will happen of desires?"

808
01:49:26,263 --> 01:49:34,466
" When this heart is plundered,
what will happen to its guests"

809
01:49:35,039 --> 01:49:43,447
" When Cupid strikes...
what will happen of desires?"

810
01:49:58,562 --> 01:50:11,202
"There are times in love
when one courts danger"

811
01:50:11,475 --> 01:50:21,146
" As of now, we lovers
are safe and sound"

812
01:50:24,955 --> 01:50:33,590
" When Spring comes...
what happens to the crazy ones?"

813
01:50:33,864 --> 01:50:41,828
" When Spring comes...
what happens to the crazy ones?"

814
01:50:42,206 --> 01:50:50,841
" When Cupid strikes...
what will happen of desires?"

815
01:51:02,192 --> 01:51:11,760
"There is a hue and cry..."

816
01:51:12,736 --> 01:51:22,304
"among your admirers"

817
01:51:22,579 --> 01:51:37,620
" Heartburn there is right now"

818
01:51:37,962 --> 01:51:46,165
" When the wings are clipped...
what will happen to the moth?"

819
01:51:46,603 --> 01:51:54,567
" When the wings are clipped...
what will happen to the moth?"

820
01:51:54,878 --> 01:52:03,616
" When Cupid strikes...
what happens of desires?"

821
01:52:18,435 --> 01:52:32,304
"These tales of love
are yet incomplete"

822
01:52:32,616 --> 01:52:45,427
"The heart has yet to tell
tales of the apocalypse"

823
01:52:46,330 --> 01:52:54,829
" When the truth is told...
what happens to the make believe?"

824
01:52:55,172 --> 01:53:03,546
" When the truth is told...
what happens to the make believe?"

825
01:53:03,847 --> 01:53:12,414
" When Cupid strikes...
what happens to desires?"

826
01:53:26,303 --> 01:53:42,345
"The devil is said to
wreak havoc on those in love"

827
01:53:42,686 --> 01:53:57,090
" But we are still in our senses"

828
01:53:57,434 --> 01:54:01,302
"Should we get drunk
and go berserk..."

829
01:54:01,538 --> 01:54:05,406
"what will happen
to these crazy lovers?"

830
01:54:05,742 --> 01:54:09,769
"Should we get drunk
and go berserk..."

831
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:14,141
"what will happen
to these crazy lovers?"

832
01:54:14,485 --> 01:54:16,578
" When Cupid strikes..."

833
01:54:18,388 --> 01:54:23,052
"when Cupid strikes..."

834
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:26,625
"what will happen
to his desires?"

835
01:54:32,703 --> 01:54:41,270
" When the heart is plundered,
what will happen to its guest?"

836
01:54:41,645 --> 01:54:51,543
" When Cupid strikes...
what will happen of desires?"

837
01:55:02,698 --> 01:55:12,869
Sir, war with love is over. The
moon-like princess' innocent heart...

838
01:55:13,075 --> 01:55:15,043
... is now filled with love.

839
01:55:15,844 --> 01:55:18,074
Should I presume it Holiness
that my waiting is over?

840
01:55:18,347 --> 01:55:20,212
That my life's problem is over?

841
01:55:20,449 --> 01:55:26,046
Life is a long journey
of untold problems my son.

842
01:55:26,321 --> 01:55:28,118
When one problem ends, a second
one appears. When the second goes...

843
01:55:28,357 --> 01:55:29,756
... the third appears, and when
the third goes, the fourth appears.

844
01:55:29,992 --> 01:55:31,084
Holiness, I did not follow.

845
01:55:31,393 --> 01:55:35,693
It's to do with the seasons, the
summer and winter, the night and...

846
01:55:35,931 --> 01:55:38,491
... day. This struggle will
keep changing.

847
01:55:38,767 --> 01:55:44,967
But the strong pillar of love in a man's
heart will remain embedded, forever.

848
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:47,265
Is that true or false princess?

849
01:55:57,619 --> 01:55:59,143
Your work is done Sir.

850
01:56:00,455 --> 01:56:05,051
You have given me a new life
Holiness please accept this gift.

851
01:56:05,360 --> 01:56:08,523
Holy men and saints don't
covet worldly wealth.

852
01:56:09,097 --> 01:56:12,897
It is a sin to refuse wealth
which comes one's way

853
01:56:13,168 --> 01:56:14,328
Please accept it.

854
01:56:14,770 --> 01:56:20,504
The stench of greed comes out
of this average mortal's mouth.

855
01:56:20,776 --> 01:56:24,212
But Holiness, don't break the
fool's gentle heart.

856
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:26,941
- I shouldn't break his heart?
- No.

857
01:56:27,416 --> 01:56:29,213
Then give it to me.

858
01:56:37,025 --> 01:56:40,756
" My arrow missed his heart and
grazed his right arm."

859
01:58:01,109 --> 01:58:02,201
They have come.

860
01:59:40,509 --> 01:59:44,570
Mother it seems that searching for
my brother we will be lost ourselves.

861
01:59:44,846 --> 01:59:48,646
Don't lose heart son, the
Lord is very powerful.

862
01:59:49,017 --> 01:59:52,783
Are these God's powers.
Lightening, thunder and storms.

863
01:59:53,155 --> 01:59:56,716
Don't say such things
at the feet of god.

864
01:59:57,492 --> 02:00:02,725
He will surely stop this storm
and make me meet my son.

865
02:00:09,271 --> 02:00:14,140
Please bring my son back.
Tell me where is he.

866
02:00:27,222 --> 02:00:29,087
Princess Chandramukhi!

867
02:00:37,265 --> 02:00:38,926
Why don't you speak?

868
02:00:39,835 --> 02:00:41,928
What has happened to
your melodious voice?

869
02:00:43,205 --> 02:00:49,974
I had no idea that you are an uncouth
musician, and a cheap trickster.

870
02:00:51,480 --> 02:00:57,441
You will learn a lesson for your
tricks prince, that your voice,...

871
02:00:57,752 --> 02:01:00,949
... of singing melodiously,
will bring scream with pain.

872
02:01:01,289 --> 02:01:04,190
These iron bracelets will be
on your wrists, and these...

873
02:01:04,493 --> 02:01:06,586
... iron chains around your legs.

874
02:01:06,895 --> 02:01:09,989
You will writhe with pain
and I will watch.

875
02:01:31,119 --> 02:01:36,785
Let the public of Rajgarh and
the courtiers know, that today...

876
02:01:36,992 --> 02:01:39,460
... for a serious matter.
The crime will be known to all and

877
02:01:39,728 --> 02:01:46,657
... so that the public learns
a lesson and knows that...

878
02:01:46,968 --> 02:01:52,736
... along with justice I too
am still alive not dead.

879
02:01:55,110 --> 02:01:57,544
Bring the person who
has asked for justice.

880
02:02:03,785 --> 02:02:06,253
I am the wife of the chief
of Kailash Nagar.

881
02:02:06,588 --> 02:02:09,921
I seek from you and this court the
rights of my state and its citizens.

882
02:02:09,991 --> 02:02:14,860
I give you my word as a Rajput
that if I or any of my officers...

883
02:02:15,096 --> 02:02:18,793
... have deprived you of any of
your rights, then the same will...

884
02:02:19,134 --> 02:02:23,093
Please free the prince of
Kailash Nagar from jail and...

885
02:02:23,371 --> 02:02:25,202
... from all allegation
against him.

886
02:02:25,407 --> 02:02:30,208
Who is that man who has dared
to arrest our dear prince?

887
02:02:30,478 --> 02:02:33,345
That wicked man is the commander-
in-chief of Rajgarh.

888
02:02:33,615 --> 02:02:37,949
A complete lie Your Highness.
The entire court knows that...

889
02:02:38,186 --> 02:02:40,677
... the death of the prince was
reported to me by the chief of...

890
02:02:40,956 --> 02:02:42,480
... Kailash Nagar himself.

891
02:02:42,791 --> 02:02:45,021
As a result of that even the
coronation could not be held there.

892
02:02:47,295 --> 02:02:50,458
Whatever I have said is true.

893
02:02:50,732 --> 02:02:53,667
What proof have you got that the
dead prince is still alive.

894
02:02:54,536 --> 02:02:57,232
What proof is there that
I have kept him locked up?

895
02:02:57,572 --> 02:02:59,767
I am the witness.

896
02:03:03,011 --> 02:03:06,378
Your Highness, I am witness to the
fact that the prince is alive and...

897
02:03:06,581 --> 02:03:08,173
... is in the custody of
the commander-in-chief.

898
02:03:08,450 --> 02:03:11,419
This coward is a wolf in
man's clothing.

899
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:15,212
In his greed, he even
tried to destroy...

900
02:03:15,490 --> 02:03:18,357
the good name of Rajgarh
and its ruler.

901
02:03:18,727 --> 02:03:22,959
Princess, I wish to know in the
presence of all...

902
02:03:24,099 --> 02:03:26,090
Is this true?

903
02:03:28,270 --> 02:03:32,070
- I demand an answer. Is this true?
- Yes Your Highness.

904
02:03:32,374 --> 02:03:37,038
Then I will burn your
wicked body to ashes.

905
02:03:37,345 --> 02:03:39,973
I will tear your bones apart and
throw them to hungry dogs.

906
02:03:40,749 --> 02:03:44,048
Arrest him. This rascal does
not deserve to live.

907
02:03:47,422 --> 02:03:52,985
Soldiers! Did you not here my
command? I say, arrest him.

908
02:03:55,030 --> 02:03:57,498
Zalim Singh, did you hear me?

909
02:04:02,237 --> 02:04:06,731
You stupid man! You have
cut off your own legs.

910
02:04:07,342 --> 02:04:10,368
I was hoping that this fool will
remain confined to his cage.

911
02:04:10,845 --> 02:04:13,473
But you have summoned your
death with your interference.

912
02:04:18,186 --> 02:04:21,383
Have you turned traitors?
You will be punished for this.

913
02:04:30,965 --> 02:04:32,865
Your rule is over now.

914
02:04:36,237 --> 02:04:38,262
Don't try to do anything.

915
02:04:39,507 --> 02:04:43,375
I warn you, move back.

916
02:05:17,979 --> 02:05:23,645
Father the time is short.
Order the troops to attack Rajgarh.

917
02:05:24,119 --> 02:05:25,211
Father, the prince's
life is in danger.

918
02:05:25,887 --> 02:05:30,415
My desires are in danger
The kingdom is in danger.

919
02:05:30,692 --> 02:05:33,126
The traitor commander-in-chief
has created havoc. The princess...

920
02:05:33,361 --> 02:05:34,953
... and the prince, both
are in his custody.

921
02:05:35,363 --> 02:05:37,593
The old king may be dead by now.

922
02:05:37,866 --> 02:05:40,835
That is the way it should be.
Weak kings don't deserve to rule.

923
02:05:41,169 --> 02:05:45,128
What are you saying father? Have you
forgotten the late king's will?

924
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:50,309
It deserved to be forgotten.
I' m surprised at your stupidity.

925
02:05:50,945 --> 02:05:54,779
Can't you see the throne of
Kailash Nagar is becoming to you.

926
02:05:55,049 --> 02:05:57,017
I can see it father.

927
02:05:57,318 --> 02:06:00,481
But it will be a betrayal of a
Rajput's trust which is his tradition.

928
02:06:00,822 --> 02:06:03,222
Fool! You can be the ruler here.

929
02:06:03,525 --> 02:06:07,518
I will never accept that.
You are untrustworthy!

930
02:06:08,029 --> 02:06:10,554
You want to rebel against me.

931
02:06:10,899 --> 02:06:15,199
If you consider justice and loyalty
unworthy, then consider me a rebel.

932
02:06:35,056 --> 02:06:37,115
Lower your eyes,
you shameless person.

933
02:06:38,126 --> 02:06:40,117
Do you know the
punishment for defiance?

934
02:06:41,896 --> 02:06:43,864
What can you give me
worse than death?

935
02:06:44,866 --> 02:06:48,734
I won't let you take embrace
death till I don't take revenge.

936
02:06:49,704 --> 02:06:55,165
Your every breath and drop of
blood is in my hands.

937
02:06:57,745 --> 02:07:00,873
Take away the sight from the
prince's arrogant eyes.

938
02:07:01,449 --> 02:07:05,180
Burn his eyes with molten rods.

939
02:07:08,323 --> 02:07:13,454
I beg of you not to take away
the light from my son's life.

940
02:07:13,962 --> 02:07:16,157
Don't hold your hands
out to this rascal.

941
02:07:17,699 --> 02:07:23,797
Have pity on me. Take my life
and my eyes, but leave the...

942
02:07:23,972 --> 02:07:26,497
... prince of Rajgarh.

943
02:07:29,511 --> 02:07:34,210
I promise that after taking my
revenge, his body will be...

944
02:07:34,482 --> 02:07:35,949
... delivered to you.

945
02:07:40,154 --> 02:07:43,180
Please forgive him, I beg of you.
- Aunt!

946
02:08:52,060 --> 02:08:58,761
I won't disappoint a mother's love.
Let the poor man be punished...

947
02:09:39,374 --> 02:09:48,976
" I cross all limits,
appealing against atrocities"

948
02:09:53,788 --> 02:09:59,420
" Will destruction..."

949
02:10:00,028 --> 02:10:13,203
"always be the lot of
those who fall in love?"

950
02:10:27,188 --> 02:10:32,888
" What life is this?
What world is this?"

951
02:10:33,494 --> 02:10:38,659
" What life is this?
What world is this?"

952
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:44,632
" Everywhere we cast a glance,
we see atrocities"

953
02:10:45,006 --> 02:10:50,774
" What life is this?
What world is this?"

954
02:11:05,660 --> 02:11:11,565
"There are some who
spend their lives in shrouds"

955
02:11:11,799 --> 02:11:17,203
" And sorrow casts gloom
in other eyes"

956
02:11:20,241 --> 02:11:25,975
" Hearts are plundered..."

957
02:11:26,247 --> 02:11:31,742
"atrocities abound everywhere"

958
02:11:32,053 --> 02:11:37,992
" What life is this...?
What world is this?"

959
02:11:49,670 --> 02:11:55,438
" Human is a foe to human..."

960
02:11:55,743 --> 02:12:00,703
"sullied with sin
is man's hand"

961
02:12:02,383 --> 02:12:08,117
"The world of love
lies shattered"

962
02:12:08,456 --> 02:12:13,894
" Everywhere we see,
atrocities abound"

963
02:12:14,195 --> 02:12:20,225
" What life is this?
What world is this?"

964
02:12:34,882 --> 02:12:39,683
"This merciless world
I have never understood"

965
02:12:40,087 --> 02:12:45,582
" Evil men play God"

966
02:12:48,529 --> 02:12:54,092
" Where are you, God...?"

967
02:12:54,402 --> 02:12:59,965
"There is atrocity everywhere"

968
02:13:00,308 --> 02:13:06,247
" What life is this?
What world is this?"

969
02:13:30,636 --> 02:13:38,839
What has happened to you?
Your eyes....

970
02:13:39,011 --> 02:13:40,376
Don't weep.

971
02:13:40,646 --> 02:13:42,341
- Prince.
- Do not weep.

972
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:52,184
Take him away. Take away from him
what I've worked all my life for.

973
02:13:52,458 --> 02:13:54,858
I don't want to ever see
the two again. Take him away!

974
02:13:56,529 --> 02:14:18,806
Don't take him away from me.
You remember I had said that

975
02:14:19,285 --> 02:14:21,310
... shed tears of blood?

976
02:14:22,588 --> 02:14:27,321
These two hands have blinded him.
The dancer has avenged herself...

977
02:14:28,060 --> 02:14:29,857
... but my revenge remains.

978
02:14:34,233 --> 02:14:39,466
You have no more bonds left.
My love gave the prince a...

979
02:14:39,705 --> 02:14:46,110
... new life, but your love
brought him to death's door.

980
02:14:46,612 --> 02:14:51,140
Don't you feel ashamed to
talk of love you witch.

981
02:14:53,786 --> 02:14:57,222
I' m not a witch, l' m a dancer.

982
02:14:57,523 --> 02:15:03,723
You had to show your low status!
If you are so proud of your love...

983
02:15:04,163 --> 02:15:09,601
...then burn your hands
which have blinded your love.

984
02:15:11,404 --> 02:15:16,569
- This too is a manifestation of love.
- You are shameless! Get out.

985
02:15:18,311 --> 02:15:24,739
I' m going. But remember,
if you don't surrender to the...

986
02:15:24,917 --> 02:15:28,910
...commander-in-chief tomorrow, your
lover's corpse will be before you.

987
02:15:29,722 --> 02:15:31,781
You will be responsible
for his death.

988
02:15:36,896 --> 02:15:40,491
" My love gave
the prince a new life,..."

989
02:15:41,133 --> 02:15:45,797
"and your love brought him
to death again."

990
02:15:46,405 --> 02:15:53,243
" You will be to blame too, when
he is hanged in front of your eyes."

991
02:15:54,280 --> 02:15:59,217
Let me go, don't take his life.

992
02:16:12,798 --> 02:16:15,824
I' ll do anything.
Take me to the commander-in-chief.

993
02:16:24,477 --> 02:16:32,441
Princess, I can't believe it. I
thought I had lost you forever.

994
02:16:38,124 --> 02:16:41,992
You will have to accept before
everyone tomorrow to become...

995
02:16:42,228 --> 02:16:43,456
... this kingdom's and my queen.

996
02:16:43,829 --> 02:16:47,162
For the sake of the prince's
life I accept all your demands.

997
02:16:47,433 --> 02:16:51,130
Alas! If you only
understood my love for you.

998
02:16:51,404 --> 02:16:54,271
To build a palace one has to
knock down many ruins.

999
02:16:56,809 --> 02:16:58,709
I want a promise from you.

1000
02:16:59,011 --> 02:17:01,912
Ask. You have every right.

1001
02:17:02,348 --> 02:17:06,478
Before all this happens, let
me meet the prince once.

1002
02:17:06,752 --> 02:17:10,347
- The prince?
- For the last time.

1003
02:17:11,824 --> 02:17:15,351
To see you happy I will harden
my heart and grant your wish.

1004
02:17:16,195 --> 02:17:19,596
Take this devotee to
her blind god.

1005
02:17:45,658 --> 02:17:49,287
Misfortune has robbed
us of everything.

1006
02:17:50,029 --> 02:17:56,229
This storm of torture has
overtaken, even our love.

1007
02:17:56,802 --> 02:18:00,795
The darkness of each night
turns to light in the morning.

1008
02:18:01,106 --> 02:18:04,769
But my eyes will not
see the happiness in my life.

1009
02:18:05,778 --> 02:18:13,116
When the morning dew shimmers in
the sun my heart would be broken.

1010
02:18:14,420 --> 02:18:19,323
Only the empty walls of this
palace will be there.

1011
02:18:19,592 --> 02:18:23,460
My lover's murderer
will be my husband.

1012
02:18:24,263 --> 02:18:28,290
I know why you have struck
this hard bargain.

1013
02:18:29,101 --> 02:18:33,800
In fact I could do nothing for you.

1014
02:18:34,406 --> 02:18:40,038
Isn't it my misfortune that the flowers
I pluck for you turn to thorns.

1015
02:18:40,379 --> 02:18:44,110
I pray for you but you
get only suffering.

1016
02:18:46,785 --> 02:18:50,619
One doesn't weigh love
by joy and sorrow.

1017
02:18:51,790 --> 02:18:54,953
These sorrows can bring tears
of blood but cannot take away...

1018
02:18:55,127 --> 02:18:56,594
... the love in our hearts.

1019
02:18:57,396 --> 02:19:00,991
These chains can tie my body but
cannot imprison my love for you.

1020
02:19:01,367 --> 02:19:07,465
But I am a woman. My body is
is meant only for my love.

1021
02:19:08,274 --> 02:19:13,143
I promise you that in this
test, I will not give my faith.

1022
02:19:13,979 --> 02:19:15,708
I will not betray you.

1023
02:19:17,116 --> 02:19:18,981
Come close to me.

1024
02:19:19,585 --> 02:19:25,717
I am always close to you, my Lord.
I only wanted to tell you that...

1025
02:19:26,392 --> 02:19:28,121
... I am going.

1026
02:19:28,827 --> 02:19:35,027
Away from this cruel world, where
taking your name will not be a crime.

1027
02:19:35,768 --> 02:19:38,464
Where there is no
punishment for loving you.

1028
02:19:54,687 --> 02:19:57,178
This gamble of
love isn't over yet.

1029
02:19:58,123 --> 02:20:01,115
Man has decided, but God
has still to decide.

1030
02:20:03,395 --> 02:20:07,229
You can see?

1031
02:20:07,700 --> 02:20:12,262
And you thought that I have destroyed
my love with my own hands?

1032
02:20:13,238 --> 02:20:20,406
I betrayed the world
princess, not my love.

1033
02:20:22,381 --> 02:20:26,511
You have done my love
a great favor.

1034
02:20:26,785 --> 02:20:27,979
It's not a favor.

1035
02:20:28,887 --> 02:20:31,355
A devotee has
done her duty.

1036
02:20:32,257 --> 02:20:34,919
I have sent a message
to Kailash Nagar.

1037
02:20:35,294 --> 02:20:37,762
Will Surinder reach here
with the army here tomorrow?

1038
02:20:38,063 --> 02:20:41,555
Yes, according to your command
your faithful soldiers will...

1039
02:20:41,934 --> 02:20:45,267
... definitely try to reach
here early tomorrow.

1040
02:20:46,238 --> 02:20:50,572
I pray, that
you get success.

1041
02:20:55,280 --> 02:20:59,011
Welcome, Your highness.

1042
02:20:59,518 --> 02:21:02,146
The boon of love which you
have given to me princess...

1043
02:21:02,454 --> 02:21:04,684
... I thank you with all my heart.

1044
02:21:05,024 --> 02:21:08,289
Wish me luck that tomorrow
at your marriage I give...

1045
02:21:08,527 --> 02:21:10,119
... a dance performance.

1046
02:21:10,663 --> 02:21:14,929
While my love
sings with me.

1047
02:21:15,200 --> 02:21:18,727
Yes of course. I will
welcome my new bride...

1048
02:21:19,071 --> 02:21:23,167
... and my new life with your
dance and a song by this musician.

1049
02:21:28,480 --> 02:21:31,813
Brave men, of Kailash Nagar
The life of your prince...

1050
02:21:32,084 --> 02:21:33,142
... is in danger.

1051
02:21:33,452 --> 02:21:37,889
Be ready. All of you come with me.
We have to reach there very soon.

1052
02:21:40,125 --> 02:21:41,683
Let's go!

1053
02:22:18,964 --> 02:22:20,864
"The day of sorrow is past"

1054
02:22:21,300 --> 02:22:23,700
"So smile, my love"

1055
02:22:24,103 --> 02:22:29,097
" A new dawn is about
to be ushered in"

1056
02:22:29,441 --> 02:22:31,932
" Love blossoms
amidst the music..."

1057
02:22:32,211 --> 02:22:39,447
" life must sing
the song of love"

1058
02:22:39,752 --> 02:22:44,951
"The day of sorrow is over;
so smile, my love"

1059
02:23:00,706 --> 02:23:06,906
" For the dancing-bells,
I sing..."

1060
02:23:07,212 --> 02:23:11,171
" love is in the air"

1061
02:23:11,517 --> 02:23:14,077
" For the dancing-bells,
I sing..."

1062
02:23:16,355 --> 02:23:21,452
" For the dancing-bells,
I sing..."

1063
02:23:21,693 --> 02:23:26,596
" love is in the air"

1064
02:23:26,965 --> 02:23:32,631
"The hour of our union is here"

1065
02:23:32,971 --> 02:23:39,843
" Happiness sways to
the tune of the times"

1066
02:23:47,820 --> 02:24:00,426
"The tinkling of the dancing bells
will usher in nice times"

1067
02:24:15,781 --> 02:24:20,775
" A new dawn is about to come"

1068
02:24:21,220 --> 02:24:26,089
" New times are upon us"

1069
02:24:31,063 --> 02:24:35,966
" A new dawn is about to come"

1070
02:24:36,335 --> 02:24:41,272
" New times are upon us"

1071
02:24:41,607 --> 02:24:46,067
"The desires of our heart
will be fulfilled"

1072
02:24:46,411 --> 02:24:54,318
"The same songs we will sing
on a happier note"

1073
02:25:01,493 --> 02:25:06,931
" A new note life is about to sing"

1074
02:25:07,232 --> 02:25:13,432
" Love blossoms
amidst the melody..."

1075
02:25:13,672 --> 02:25:17,130
" life is about to celebrate
the new dawn"

1076
02:25:17,476 --> 02:25:22,641
"The pall of gloom has lifted.
So smile, my love"

1077
02:30:09,932 --> 02:30:13,299
It's not good to cry
like this.

1078
02:30:13,469 --> 02:30:16,302
Keep quite. I beg of you.

1079
02:30:16,572 --> 02:30:22,135
Congratulations to the prince.
The enemy has surrendered.

1080
02:30:25,347 --> 02:30:29,579
You are responsible
for this victory.

1081
02:30:29,852 --> 02:30:33,253
But prince, my duty
is not over yet.

1082
02:30:41,230 --> 02:30:46,793
I am ashamed that he is my father,
and is responsible for your misfortunes.

1083
02:30:47,102 --> 02:30:49,229
You can give
him any punishment.

1084
02:30:49,538 --> 02:30:52,803
Is this punishment any less that
in front of his own children...

1085
02:30:53,142 --> 02:30:55,007
...he stands with
his head hung in shame?

1086
02:30:56,845 --> 02:31:00,440
Your son has compensated
for all your crimes.

1087
02:31:00,949 --> 02:31:02,644
You are free now.

1088
02:31:04,686 --> 02:31:17,929
Salutations to the prince!
Salutations to the princess.
