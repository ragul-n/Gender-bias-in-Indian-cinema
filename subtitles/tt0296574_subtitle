1
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:50,859
Whatever you say...

2
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:53,018
everything one does in life
is for a profit

3
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,900
This business is done
for a profit too

4
00:01:01,036 --> 00:01:04,005
Without paying taxes
or keeping accounts

5
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,800
"Because this business is run on fear,
not paperwork"

6
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,877
Anyone wishing to enrol
can enlist

7
00:01:18,921 --> 00:01:20,889
But he can't pull out

8
00:01:25,827 --> 00:01:28,887
"And most importantly, anyone
breaking our rules..."

9
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:32,864
is broken down

10
00:01:34,937 --> 00:01:40,773
"Friendship, respect, loyalty...
everything has but one goal"

11
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:44,870
Profits

12
00:01:49,785 --> 00:01:51,753
And profits there will be

13
00:01:52,854 --> 00:01:55,789
"This way, or that..."

14
00:01:58,894 --> 00:01:59,986
any which way

15
00:03:18,874 --> 00:03:21,968
"Namaskar, this is Sumit Awasthi.
Welcome to "Aajtak"

16
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,871
The headlines

17
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:04,878
Few people know that the hawk
is a very patient bird

18
00:05:07,048 --> 00:05:12,988
"Once it sights its victim,
not an hour, not a day..."

19
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:19,021
the hawk flies in the skies
for a week and a month

20
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,020
Till it is the right time

21
00:05:25,768 --> 00:05:27,962
And when the time arrives...

22
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:31,005
"even before you can blink,
the victim has been grabbed"

23
00:05:32,908 --> 00:05:34,876
Even if it is in a crowded city

24
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:38,846
Malik used to run an import-export
business in those days

25
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,815
But that was only a front

26
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:44,885
He was actually a special member
of the Aslam Ali gang

27
00:05:47,856 --> 00:05:50,985
His proximity with Ali caused heartburn
among the older members of the gang

28
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:55,988
They were close because Malik
had used his intelligence...

29
00:05:56,765 --> 00:05:58,825
to spread the tentacles
of the gang

30
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:01,926
So much so that they were in
the need of many new members

31
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:07,865
It was during this that
Malik first met Chandu

32
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,979
Will you work for me?
- That's what I'm here for

33
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:18,981
How much do you want?
- You called me here. So you tell me

34
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:23,822
10 thousand for you and 5 thousand
for your companions

35
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,896
We make that much anyway. So what's
the use of working for you?

36
00:06:33,903 --> 00:06:35,962
Know what it means to join
Aslambhai's gang?

37
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:39,007
We're not into petty stuff

38
00:06:39,876 --> 00:06:41,843
We're into big time

39
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,939
Anyone can be bumped off
at any time

40
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:56,790
Are you scared of death?
- I'm scared of nothing

41
00:07:07,003 --> 00:07:09,767
All right. You get 20
and they get 10

42
00:07:10,006 --> 00:07:11,837
That's it

43
00:07:15,944 --> 00:07:17,913
Discuss the rest with panditji

44
00:07:22,852 --> 00:07:23,977
May I go?

45
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,866
Useful guy

46
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,806
"Joseph, get the car out"

47
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:50,743
"Useful guy? He talked back
at you, Malikbhai"

48
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:52,810
He's terribly arrogant

49
00:07:53,783 --> 00:07:56,047
He's arrogant because he knows
he's useful

50
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
What the?

51
00:08:05,928 --> 00:08:07,987
"Chandubhai, I thought you had
gone off your rocker"

52
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:12,890
"The way you spoke to Malikbhai,
I thought we were all dead men"

53
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:14,937
I don't care for him

54
00:08:16,005 --> 00:08:21,807
"Malik's an okay guy. But that guy
who fingered me, the bastard!"

55
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:24,846
"He's Yadav.
- Whoever he is, to hell with him"

56
00:08:24,914 --> 00:08:29,874
I felt like stuffing a knife in
his ass and pulling out his guts

57
00:08:29,986 --> 00:08:31,920
"Cool it, I say"

58
00:08:32,755 --> 00:08:34,814
"We haven't even started working,
and he's already playing hero"

59
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:40,020
Want to see what a hero I am?
- Sit down. Sit

60
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:46,732
Listen to me carefully.
Days when we joked are past

61
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:49,903
"If you want to break into big time,
stop prancing like kids"

62
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:53,775
Or you'll be blown away
before your time

63
00:08:53,975 --> 00:08:57,911
"Chandu, where's the need for us
to work under someone?"

64
00:08:58,014 --> 00:09:01,973
"Look, nobody works under anybody"

65
00:09:03,753 --> 00:09:06,017
They need us. And we need them

66
00:09:08,057 --> 00:09:11,891
We want to do something big and
only they have big jobs in the city

67
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:16,829
The job is of course theirs.
But we name the price

68
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:20,861
Who is it that said we don't
need to think too much?

69
00:09:22,004 --> 00:09:25,906
"So long as we are all together,
we'll take them all as they come"

70
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:30,844
"Pappu, why're you sitting
with your lips sealed?"

71
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:34,814
What will I say? I'll just do
as you say. What Warsi?

72
00:09:34,984 --> 00:09:38,920
Yes... but I'm not sparing
that bloody midget

73
00:09:39,055 --> 00:09:43,788
"There he goes again. Somebody
label him "Crackpot Dagdi Warsi"

74
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:45,986
What did you call me?
You call me a crackpot?

75
00:09:46,929 --> 00:09:48,760
Out of my way!

76
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,956
"Sit down... you sit, too"

77
00:09:56,906 --> 00:10:01,036
What is it? What're you watching?
Sit down. Sit!

78
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,980
It's very late. She must be
sitting with her claws out for me

79
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:18,758
Go home now. And go straight home.
- Sure

80
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,768
You take this for a hotel
you can come anytime to?

81
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:28,770
"Open the door, Ma.
- Where were you?"

82
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:30,896
I've returned before midnight.
So don't nag me now

83
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:36,808
Big favour he has done to me.
He will eat. At midnight

84
00:10:36,946 --> 00:10:38,937
Who asked you for anything?
Just go to sleep

85
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:42,780
I'm not hungry.
- Don't talk rubbish

86
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:45,886
"Lunch at midnight, dinner at lunch...
- Must you pick on me always?"

87
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:49,855
You start nagging the moment I...
- Who else do I have but you?

88
00:10:49,992 --> 00:10:52,756
Tell me.
- What're you doing? Are you mad?

89
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,998
Idiot! I've made some
curry and rice

90
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,002
Ma...
- Yes?

91
00:11:01,837 --> 00:11:03,805
I've found a nice job.
- Where?

92
00:11:04,907 --> 00:11:08,741
With someone called Alibhai.
- What work is it?

93
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:10,936
He runs a business.
- What business?

94
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,775
Many things

95
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:46,973
"When the game is big, you take
care of yourself first"

96
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:48,884
I know

97
00:11:57,893 --> 00:11:59,986
"Yes, it stinks.
But it's business"

98
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:08,995
Our business isn't what
people make it out to be

99
00:12:09,905 --> 00:12:12,772
There's this 40-storeyed tower
coming up Narayani Chowk

100
00:12:12,908 --> 00:12:15,934
The buiIder came to us.
Hi Raju! How're you doing?

101
00:12:17,913 --> 00:12:19,972
He asked us to help him
sell the buiIding

102
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:23,876
We spoke to a dozen buyers
and got him the right price

103
00:12:24,753 --> 00:12:26,983
That's it. And people will
say anything

104
00:12:27,923 --> 00:12:29,891
There's no trouble every day
at our place

105
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:34,985
What happens sometimes is that
people are dishonest in business

106
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:40,960
Or they work against principles.
One has to take care then

107
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:45,873
That happens once in 2 or 3 months.
Aslambhai has a great reputation

108
00:12:46,909 --> 00:12:48,774
Nobody interferes

109
00:12:48,944 --> 00:12:52,778
"Besides, Ma, no one can make it
to the top by the right way"

110
00:12:52,915 --> 00:12:55,782
"Yes, it stinks.
But it's business"

111
00:13:04,893 --> 00:13:07,794
What say Aslam?
All gleaming?

112
00:13:07,896 --> 00:13:10,990
This is my babe.
It's gotta look gorgeous

113
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,995
She looks like a heroine's cheeks

114
00:13:22,044 --> 00:13:24,012
You've been avoiding me

115
00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:27,875
Will I call you all my life
forjust ten million?

116
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:30,986
Where's Malikbhai?

117
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,820
Where's Malikbhai?

118
00:13:42,898 --> 00:13:43,956
Laugh

119
00:13:45,968 --> 00:13:50,928
"What's with danger, Ma? Man can die
even while crossing a street"

120
00:13:51,006 --> 00:13:53,873
He's double of what I hoped.
- Who?

121
00:13:53,942 --> 00:13:55,967
Chandu. Know what he did?

122
00:13:56,812 --> 00:13:58,871
"Malikbhai, do you know
what Chandu did to Chopra?"

123
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,716
I said what will you discuss with
Malikbhai. Just give us the money

124
00:14:06,989 --> 00:14:10,948
He started irritating me.
And I had to give him the treatment

125
00:14:11,827 --> 00:14:14,728
But the money will arrive on time.
- All right

126
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,992
I'll have to sit him
over a couple of drinks

127
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:22,735
I'll have to talk to him lovingly
to bring him back to his senses

128
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:23,872
Why?

129
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:29,808
"With special men, we must always
maintain a relationship"

130
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:33,906
"When you know he's special,
why must things reach this state?"

131
00:14:34,983 --> 00:14:38,817
Because even special men
need to be reminded...

132
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:40,889
that they can be dispensable

133
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,984
You keep pampering just
about anyone

134
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:49,796
You're talking about Chandu?
- No... just about anybody

135
00:14:55,003 --> 00:14:56,971
Is Chandu of any use?

136
00:14:59,007 --> 00:15:00,975
He's like the AK47

137
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:12,987
Who goes to theatres anyway?

138
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:15,857
They watch the movies at home
on VCDs

139
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,926
Why won't they if they
make nice movies?

140
00:15:18,026 --> 00:15:20,790
"Stuff the movie with fights,
dance and the works"

141
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:22,988
Get him to make a movie now.
- Shut your trap

142
00:15:35,911 --> 00:15:36,878
Greetings

143
00:15:39,883 --> 00:15:41,850
You... are Chandu?

144
00:15:46,955 --> 00:15:49,890
"Mubarakbhai, your stuff is ready"

145
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:51,993
But it's only four crates

146
00:15:54,897 --> 00:15:58,025
I asked for 6.
- Malikbhai told us to give only 4

147
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:05,736
Malik... give me two more crates.
I'll have a word with Malik

148
00:16:05,842 --> 00:16:07,968
First talk to Malik.
- I told you

149
00:16:08,043 --> 00:16:10,012
Your telling won't help here

150
00:16:10,813 --> 00:16:12,872
"That which Malikbhai says,
happens"

151
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:15,817
Hey! What's up?

152
00:16:15,918 --> 00:16:18,751
"He's asking you, isn't he?
So deliver"

153
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:20,980
What's happening here?

154
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:25,849
"Nothing, Mubarakbhai. Two boxes
got misplaced while counting"

155
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:27,996
"Take four crates away now.
You have my word..."

156
00:16:28,765 --> 00:16:30,732
two more will be delivered
by afternoon tomorrow. Okay?

157
00:16:32,936 --> 00:16:34,028
Bhai! Come on!

158
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:41,968
Remain hidden... I'll handle it

159
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:53,981
Come here

160
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,951
What's been going on there?

161
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:00,862
Where?

162
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:02,990
Who were they?

163
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,764
How would I know?.
- Spit that beedi out!

164
00:17:07,803 --> 00:17:09,772
Spit it out and talk to me

165
00:17:11,974 --> 00:17:14,876
So why were you talking to them?

166
00:17:15,812 --> 00:17:17,972
Who was talking?
I was only asking for a match

167
00:17:18,815 --> 00:17:19,907
A match eh?

168
00:17:21,885 --> 00:17:24,717
Where did they go away
in such panic?

169
00:17:24,888 --> 00:17:28,721
How'd I know?. Must've been
in a hurry. Go and ask them

170
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:29,983
Really?

171
00:17:31,026 --> 00:17:33,995
What are you doing here
so late in the night?

172
00:17:34,997 --> 00:17:36,965
I went to see a picture

173
00:17:39,002 --> 00:17:40,901
Why? Is watching a picture forbidden?

174
00:17:41,904 --> 00:17:44,873
Get him...
I'll show you a picture

175
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:49,808
Get him.
- Come on... hop in

176
00:17:51,914 --> 00:17:53,849
Get in and sit down

177
00:18:04,761 --> 00:18:06,887
Ma asked when we are
getting married

178
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:11,000
You want to?

179
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,899
"What do you want?
- What's a marriage, Saroja?"

180
00:18:18,808 --> 00:18:21,800
It's when two people seek the
world's approval to live together

181
00:18:22,045 --> 00:18:25,013
And I've never sought anybody's
approval for anything I've done

182
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,975
"If it still makes a difference
to your mother..."

183
00:18:29,018 --> 00:18:30,985
let's light a fire
and take the vows

184
00:18:36,926 --> 00:18:40,725
Sometimes I think there's
a monster hidden in you

185
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:42,965
There's a monster
in every human being

186
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,959
It's just that some people
are scared of confronting it

187
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:57,775
So you're fond of watching pictures?

188
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:11,951
Speak

189
00:19:38,755 --> 00:19:39,949
Where's Gadeji?

190
00:19:45,828 --> 00:19:47,796
Sharma.
- Over there

191
00:19:51,968 --> 00:19:54,732
Is she a fool to be doing
the rounds for two years?

192
00:19:54,804 --> 00:19:56,771
Malik!
Here you go

193
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:59,875
What makes you think of me today?

194
00:19:59,976 --> 00:20:03,002
You must've heard of last night's
trouble. One of my boys got caught

195
00:20:03,813 --> 00:20:05,780
"Yes, Saeed says he
has an acid tongue"

196
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:08,748
Let him rot. The cops will
straighten him out for free

197
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:11,786
He's our boy. He was caught
doing ajob for us

198
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:14,890
"What will the other boys think,
if we don't get him out?"

199
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:19,019
What do you want now?.
- I've made enquiries

200
00:20:19,996 --> 00:20:23,830
Inspector Rathod is very corrupt.
He's the Thakur's friend

201
00:20:25,935 --> 00:20:27,869
Is Thakursaab there?

202
00:20:43,886 --> 00:20:45,854
Back off there!

203
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,789
The bloody...

204
00:20:53,896 --> 00:20:56,797
This is the first time you've come
to my house. Have a cup of tea

205
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:02,796
Where were you? There was no word!
Couldn't you telephone?

206
00:21:02,905 --> 00:21:04,873
Couldn't you telephone?
- Quiet... I'll explain

207
00:21:05,007 --> 00:21:06,975
Malikbhai is here.
- Stop it

208
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:08,874
Malikbhai is here.
- Who?

209
00:21:10,046 --> 00:21:12,913
My boss. I told you

210
00:21:15,918 --> 00:21:17,852
Please come in

211
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:19,955
Couldn't you tell me?

212
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,884
We haven't been getting any water.
So all the clothes...

213
00:21:24,026 --> 00:21:26,017
"Chandu, let him sit down"

214
00:21:27,897 --> 00:21:30,798
"Had I known, I'd have
brought something to eat"

215
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,958
Just plain tea...
- That's not necessary

216
00:21:32,034 --> 00:21:36,801
I was telling Chandu that we'd talk to
Panditji and arrange a flat for you

217
00:21:36,973 --> 00:21:39,874
We have some friends among buiIders.
- I know

218
00:21:44,046 --> 00:21:45,809
Yes?

219
00:21:45,915 --> 00:21:48,975
"It's that new boy, Chandu.
Bring him to me immediately"

220
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:50,986
Yes

221
00:21:56,893 --> 00:22:00,727
Chandu and I've got to go somewhere.
I'll send another car for you

222
00:22:00,997 --> 00:22:02,760
Let's go

223
00:22:03,766 --> 00:22:07,998
"What did you get? A bullet gets
in here, and life ebbs out there"

224
00:22:09,005 --> 00:22:10,973
Another car's arriving for the lady.
Stay here

225
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,970
Where are we going so suddenly?
- To Aslambhai

226
00:22:17,914 --> 00:22:19,882
Is Chandu okay at work?

227
00:22:24,987 --> 00:22:27,854
I always tell him to put his heart
in his work

228
00:22:32,795 --> 00:22:37,732
"He won't tell me, but he has
great respect for Malikbhai"

229
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:43,861
Malikbhai trusts few people too

230
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:50,743
This thing hurts...
give it up

231
00:22:51,948 --> 00:22:53,006
Sometimes

232
00:22:57,887 --> 00:22:59,855
Who's Saeed?

233
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:02,949
He's been with Aslambhai
for a long time

234
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:07,794
"Saeed, his brother Anis, Sharma,
Latif, Shankar..."

235
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:10,891
they're jealous because we're
doing well in our business

236
00:23:31,921 --> 00:23:33,013
"Greetings, Malikbhai"

237
00:23:38,961 --> 00:23:41,896
Well Sajid? You've put on weight.
- It's one of those things

238
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:44,924
Is someone there with Bhai?
- Saeedbhai

239
00:23:50,907 --> 00:23:52,875
How're you keeping Aslambhai?

240
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:03,884
You've got the itch in you?
- Aslambhai...

241
00:24:04,887 --> 00:24:06,946
Chandu did just what
I asked him to do

242
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:12,791
The market pays four for two.
Mubarak has been fooling us

243
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:14,963
"Ask Patel, if you wish to"

244
00:24:15,898 --> 00:24:18,731
"If Saeed doesn't know, it won't
hurt him to ask around"

245
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:19,961
"Malik, I did telephone you!"

246
00:24:21,904 --> 00:24:24,805
I've told you so often that we don't
discuss business over the telephone

247
00:24:26,876 --> 00:24:29,868
"As you know, the police are
tapping phone-lines everywhere"

248
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:33,812
"You mean any Tom, Dick and Harry
will talk back at me?"

249
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:38,885
This pig? He'll call me names?
He'll heap abuse on my womenfolk?

250
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:40,989
The bastard's lying!

251
00:24:47,797 --> 00:24:49,765
"Chandu, put that gun down.
- Now talk!"

252
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,860
"Chandu, go out... go on"

253
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:57,735
So he's the one you
were taking up for?

254
00:24:59,008 --> 00:25:01,875
I took up for him because
he's on our side

255
00:25:03,012 --> 00:25:06,948
Everyone knows who was around
when the need arose

256
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:09,885
"We can't find such boys
every other day, Aslambhai"

257
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,853
"Someone else will employ him,
if we throw him out"

258
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:13,946
What will we do if
he speaks up for them?

259
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:18,825
But if you still think he has
said things he shouldn't have...

260
00:25:18,928 --> 00:25:21,988
I apologise.
Forgive him

261
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,889
I must leave now

262
00:25:31,974 --> 00:25:35,034
"Aslambhai, you didn't say a word!
- What will I say?"

263
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:39,972
What he said was right. You can't
do a thing without squabbling

264
00:25:41,784 --> 00:25:42,910
Your own hands are broken

265
00:25:42,985 --> 00:25:45,977
"And when someone else wants to work,
you put obstacles in his path"

266
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:50,721
Allah!

267
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:58,967
I'm already in trouble. And this
mess with you guys won't end

268
00:25:59,969 --> 00:26:02,870
My waist's been hurting
since yesterday

269
00:26:03,973 --> 00:26:05,941
And I've got to take
all these medicines...

270
00:26:05,975 --> 00:26:07,943
they're setting my stomach on fire

271
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:11,810
Abdul!
- Coming

272
00:26:11,914 --> 00:26:14,007
I can't see. Shut that window

273
00:26:14,884 --> 00:26:17,819
The old man's gone senile.
I wanted to break his break!

274
00:26:17,887 --> 00:26:21,721
He's not going senile.
He's openly taking up for Malik

275
00:26:23,893 --> 00:26:24,951
So then?

276
00:26:26,028 --> 00:26:28,895
It's obvious. Either Malik lives.
Or we do

277
00:26:28,931 --> 00:26:30,899
That's what I've decided too

278
00:26:36,772 --> 00:26:40,037
The only difference is that I
thought about it before you

279
00:26:44,814 --> 00:26:47,874
"Look Malik, what happened in there...
- It has nothing to do with that"

280
00:26:48,884 --> 00:26:50,852
It has to do with the future

281
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:56,856
"Look, Malik. There's a lot
of money in our business"

282
00:26:57,927 --> 00:26:59,895
Enough for both of us

283
00:27:00,896 --> 00:27:04,992
"Let's end these petty squabbles
and share the spoiIs, okay?"

284
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:10,768
"If you had the gun in your hand,
would you share with me?"

285
00:27:18,881 --> 00:27:23,784
"Now look, Malik.
I know it well..."

286
00:27:24,987 --> 00:27:27,751
that you can't make the mistake
of letting me get away alive

287
00:27:28,991 --> 00:27:32,893
But we have worked together
for years

288
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,889
"Have some mercy,
for all those years"

289
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,993
Let my brother go

290
00:27:40,903 --> 00:27:43,929
You know he can't run
the gang without me

291
00:27:44,774 --> 00:27:47,038
He'll start some other business...
he'll give up all this

292
00:27:47,877 --> 00:27:48,969
"Malikbhai, why I...
- Shut up!"

293
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:51,912
The two of us will start
another business

294
00:27:52,915 --> 00:27:54,780
Shut up!

295
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,889
"If one of us lives, both the
families will be looked after"

296
00:28:04,994 --> 00:28:08,896
Let my brother go... okay?
Please let him go

297
00:28:11,902 --> 00:28:13,766
All right

298
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:34,856
Brother... brother...

299
00:28:35,925 --> 00:28:37,791
Brother...

300
00:29:10,026 --> 00:29:11,926
I've finished Saeed and Anis

301
00:29:15,764 --> 00:29:18,791
Send a dozen of our boys
to Sri Junction with Kekre

302
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:37,010
You told Saeed you wouldn't
be killing his brother

303
00:29:37,786 --> 00:29:39,721
So why?

304
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:44,986
"Chandu, what did I lose
if Saeed died a happy man?"

305
00:29:46,996 --> 00:29:48,965
His brother was scared

306
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:51,958
But he'd have sought revenge
the moment he reached home

307
00:29:53,002 --> 00:29:57,837
"And more than his family,
I'm worried about my boys"

308
00:30:07,017 --> 00:30:09,815
Where now?.
- To Sharma

309
00:30:10,987 --> 00:30:13,717
He's the only one
who can cause trouble

310
00:30:25,901 --> 00:30:28,803
What Malik? You walk in
anytime you want to

311
00:30:29,005 --> 00:30:34,738
I'm here to kill Sharma.
I don't want any bloodshed

312
00:30:44,953 --> 00:30:46,011
Mr Rathod

313
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:50,949
Hi Hero... how are you?
- What brings you here suddenly?

314
00:30:51,894 --> 00:30:55,796
I'm not here to look at your face.
Dagda's stuff is arriving from Pune

315
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,867
It'll be unloaded at Dahisar

316
00:30:59,002 --> 00:31:01,834
So Mr Rathod?
Stuffing a lot of bankrolls?

317
00:31:01,905 --> 00:31:07,969
That's my job. I stuff him first.
And I stuff currency notes now

318
00:31:11,915 --> 00:31:13,780
Go on

319
00:31:20,023 --> 00:31:23,789
What's happening here?
- They've killed Saeed and Anis

320
00:31:25,995 --> 00:31:27,895
So what are you going to do?

321
00:31:43,913 --> 00:31:49,874
"Makes no difference to me...
whether he pays me, or you"

322
00:31:57,894 --> 00:31:59,862
"Bhai, I want to kill!
- What?"

323
00:32:00,028 --> 00:32:03,931
"I want to kill him, that's all
- What? You'll kill a cop?"

324
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,868
Him?
- What rubbish is he talking? What?

325
00:32:08,738 --> 00:32:10,968
You'll kill a cop?
Bastard!

326
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,900
You forgot the trashing you took
at the police station?

327
00:32:14,744 --> 00:32:16,974
You'll kill a cop? Let me see!
You'll kill a cop?

328
00:32:18,014 --> 00:32:22,007
My gun? I've forgotten it
or I'd have shot you right here

329
00:32:22,852 --> 00:32:25,980
"You threaten me, bloody tramp!
Go on... hit a policeman"

330
00:32:26,923 --> 00:32:29,892
Hit a cop if you have the guts.
Go on... hit me

331
00:32:29,993 --> 00:32:31,961
Kill him.
- Forgot the beating you took?

332
00:32:51,047 --> 00:32:53,015
Saeed and Anis are gone

333
00:32:57,887 --> 00:33:02,722
You know what state Aslambhai is in.
It's for you to decide.

334
00:33:03,927 --> 00:33:06,725
"Will you work with me,
or will you?"

335
00:33:16,005 --> 00:33:18,940
"Chandu, those four bodies..."

336
00:33:34,757 --> 00:33:37,726
"Aslambhai, I've killed
Saeed and Sharma"

337
00:33:38,828 --> 00:33:40,853
No... keep lying down

338
00:33:41,898 --> 00:33:43,866
I had no other way

339
00:33:45,802 --> 00:33:48,771
"Had I not killed them,
they'd have killed me"

340
00:33:49,973 --> 00:33:53,909
And had I told you... you wouldn't
have allowed me to kill them

341
00:33:55,912 --> 00:33:57,971
"So, without even telling you,
I had to..."

342
00:33:59,916 --> 00:34:05,855
"Aslambhai, please go back to sleep.
You've worked so hard..."

343
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,723
brought the business so far...
brought us so far too

344
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,024
You take care of your health now.
I'll take care of the business

345
00:34:28,044 --> 00:34:29,909
In the next 48 hours...

346
00:34:30,914 --> 00:34:35,783
"with three weapons called
murder, money and compromise..."

347
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:41,880
Malik took control of his and other
gangs before the sun could set

348
00:34:42,892 --> 00:34:46,726
"In other words, he took over the reins
of the whole of Mumbai's undetworld"

349
00:34:46,996 --> 00:34:49,965
It isn't as if the police was fast
asleep when all this was happening

350
00:34:52,001 --> 00:34:56,870
Veerapalli Sreenivasan looked more
like a professor in a college

351
00:34:57,807 --> 00:35:00,776
"Which he was, before joining the IPS"

352
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:04,812
But the brains behind his soft
and compassionate face...

353
00:35:04,914 --> 00:35:07,007
sent a chill down the
criminals' spines

354
00:35:08,017 --> 00:35:10,815
Everywhere he went during
his career...

355
00:35:10,887 --> 00:35:12,855
the crime graph fell

356
00:35:13,923 --> 00:35:16,915
And now with him as the
Joint Commissioner of Mumbai...

357
00:35:17,026 --> 00:35:18,926
there was a lot of peace

358
00:35:19,896 --> 00:35:24,833
And suddenly there was news of
an upheaval in Aslam Ali's gang

359
00:35:26,903 --> 00:35:28,962
"Sir, there's news from Bandra
police station"

360
00:35:29,772 --> 00:35:32,866
Saeed Mirza of AIfa Bar and his
brother have been missing for 2 days

361
00:35:34,944 --> 00:35:37,811
"No, sir. There's just no question
of another gang being involved"

362
00:35:39,015 --> 00:35:41,779
Who'd mess with a gang
as big as Aslam's?

363
00:35:41,985 --> 00:35:45,944
"His name is Sharma, sir.
He's an Octroi agent"

364
00:35:47,924 --> 00:35:50,791
"Please don't take offense,
but Inspector Rathod..."

365
00:35:50,893 --> 00:35:52,986
didn't have a very nice reputation

366
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:58,958
Arif said that there's a tug
of war between Malik and Saeed

367
00:36:00,003 --> 00:36:02,733
"I don't think Malik has
a hand in all this, sir"

368
00:36:03,006 --> 00:36:05,770
"In any case, I haven't heard much
about him in the recent past"

369
00:36:08,978 --> 00:36:11,879
May you didn't hear about him...

370
00:36:11,981 --> 00:36:15,007
because he didn't want us to hear

371
00:40:32,909 --> 00:40:35,810
Harish Chadha. Owner of
the club MiG29 nightclub

372
00:40:36,746 --> 00:40:39,806
"Vijay Singh, Vice-president,
India, of Bank of Mauritius"

373
00:40:40,917 --> 00:40:43,853
"Rhea Burman, this year
Miss Mumbai"

374
00:40:44,887 --> 00:40:46,856
And fiImstar Naved Khan

375
00:40:47,957 --> 00:40:50,825
What was he doing there?
- I don't know...

376
00:40:50,893 --> 00:40:54,990
but they appeared to be good friends.
- For drugs?

377
00:40:55,998 --> 00:40:58,865
"They have a lot of sources to get
their supply of drugs, sir"

378
00:40:59,903 --> 00:41:02,872
"Why would they go to Malik
for that, sir?"

379
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:08,876
"I can't understand why they even need
to meet someone like Malik, sir"

380
00:41:09,045 --> 00:41:11,844
They don't need to.
Malik needs it

381
00:41:12,816 --> 00:41:15,875
Malik isn't one of those old
fashioned guys who kills with guns

382
00:41:15,952 --> 00:41:19,912
He's killing them with his brains
and making friends through the gun

383
00:41:21,023 --> 00:41:22,957
"Back in Kerala, we have a saying"

384
00:41:23,026 --> 00:41:25,995
"After six months of friendship,
the two of them swap places"

385
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:30,829
"If we don't finish Malik right now,
forget arresting him..."

386
00:41:30,934 --> 00:41:33,993
"to even meet him, we'd need
permission from a hundred people"

387
00:41:35,739 --> 00:41:39,903
Here's another room. Your loo
is right beside. Squeaky clean

388
00:41:40,776 --> 00:41:44,906
Water running 24 hours.
Airy up here

389
00:41:45,816 --> 00:41:50,878
"If you need, we'll get airconditioning.
You can sit right here... what's up?"

390
00:41:51,854 --> 00:41:56,815
You've become a big boy.
- So I am

391
00:41:57,927 --> 00:42:02,888
"That's marble. Imported. Come on,
I'll show you the other room"

392
00:42:05,835 --> 00:42:10,773
Where did marriage crop out of?
- You're making a nice living

393
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,001
"Time to fall in line.
- Drop it, what's the hurry?"

394
00:42:14,844 --> 00:42:18,872
"Someday you'll marry, won't you?
The girl is willing too"

395
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,718
What girl?
- Kanu

396
00:42:21,984 --> 00:42:24,852
Come again.
- Kanu

397
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:28,014
Are you mad? Kanu is still a baby.
- What baby?

398
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:32,955
"She's only 2 years younger than you.
Says, she's going to marry only you"

399
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:36,863
What?
- Lots of guys are after her

400
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,969
Don't you tell me
I never warned you

401
00:42:42,973 --> 00:42:49,810
"Kanu, I never knew, I mean
I was shocked. You never said..."

402
00:42:49,913 --> 00:42:51,881
I said it now

403
00:42:52,749 --> 00:42:53,875
"Yes, but..."

404
00:42:56,853 --> 00:42:57,876
What?

405
00:43:00,891 --> 00:43:04,987
"Kanu, you know what business I'm into?
- Yes"

406
00:43:06,028 --> 00:43:07,997
What?
- You're a hood

407
00:43:08,831 --> 00:43:10,891
And you still want to marry me?
- Yes

408
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:14,027
But why?
- Because I like you

409
00:43:17,841 --> 00:43:21,868
"If you got an affair, just say it.
- No, I got no affairs"

410
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:28,885
So?
- Yes what?

411
00:43:29,786 --> 00:43:33,984
So what do you say?
- What have I got to say?

412
00:43:35,759 --> 00:43:36,953
I like you too

413
00:43:48,905 --> 00:43:52,807
Say something.
- What have I got to say? I told you

414
00:43:52,909 --> 00:43:54,877
I like you too

415
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:00,916
Do I leave now?.

416
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:03,945
"Yes, go on"

417
00:44:11,895 --> 00:44:12,827
What?

418
00:44:15,031 --> 00:44:16,794
Well what is it?

419
00:44:18,902 --> 00:44:19,869
SiIly

420
00:44:19,936 --> 00:44:22,700
Happy?
- Like you're doing me a favour?

421
00:44:23,006 --> 00:44:26,942
"Doing it for yourself, aren't you?
- For myself okay, but you wanted too"

422
00:44:27,911 --> 00:44:30,812
"Chandu, Krishnan called.
Movie starts shooting at eleven"

423
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,012
What's up?

424
00:44:39,956 --> 00:44:42,982
He's marrying your sister.
- What?

425
00:44:44,895 --> 00:44:47,864
What are you gaping at?
You're my brother-in-law now

426
00:44:57,774 --> 00:44:58,934
Met him?

427
00:45:01,912 --> 00:45:03,812
Stop staring at me

428
00:45:03,914 --> 00:45:07,873
I said stop staring at me

429
00:45:16,026 --> 00:45:20,929
I had to arrive. Hit?
This is going to be superhit

430
00:45:21,898 --> 00:45:23,957
"If Akram makes a movie,
it can only be a hit picture"

431
00:45:25,902 --> 00:45:28,928
Send your brother over.
I'll take care of him

432
00:45:31,975 --> 00:45:34,808
Congratulations Akram.
So everyone's here

433
00:45:34,878 --> 00:45:36,869
Hi Yadav.
- Hi Mr Producer

434
00:45:39,816 --> 00:45:42,751
All thanks to Malikbhai.
- I told you

435
00:45:51,995 --> 00:45:53,758
Naved

436
00:45:53,897 --> 00:45:55,831
"Malikbhai, he's the director"

437
00:46:05,041 --> 00:46:11,879
"As everyone here knows,
my last movie was a big-big hit"

438
00:46:18,755 --> 00:46:20,882
"As you know, I make movies
from the heart"

439
00:46:22,025 --> 00:46:29,761
"What I'm about to embark upon,
isn't a fiIm, it's a dream"

440
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,733
And it's called
When in Love

441
00:46:46,883 --> 00:46:49,977
With me on my project
is producer Akram Ansari

442
00:46:53,023 --> 00:46:58,791
Our industry needs men like him

443
00:46:59,896 --> 00:47:02,797
"If he is, we are. EIse..."

444
00:47:23,887 --> 00:47:27,846
"In your arms,
this world of mine"

445
00:47:28,892 --> 00:47:32,851
Where are we headed?

446
00:47:33,963 --> 00:47:37,990
But never shall we part

447
00:48:08,765 --> 00:48:10,892
"The shooting resulted
in a pandemonium"

448
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:15,999
"Of the five men who ended up
in hospital, two are dead"

449
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,774
One is still critical

450
00:48:18,975 --> 00:48:21,808
"With the shootout,
the controversy of links..."

451
00:48:21,845 --> 00:48:23,870
"between fiIms and the undetworld
rages again"

452
00:48:24,914 --> 00:48:30,875
"Behind the Bollywood arclights,
not everything glitters"

453
00:48:34,023 --> 00:48:39,962
Crime Branch called. They want us to
identify some guys they've picked up

454
00:48:40,897 --> 00:48:44,833
"Whatever the truth, the strange
relationship between art and violence..."

455
00:48:44,901 --> 00:48:49,770
"shows that spread of
the tentacles of the undetworld..."

456
00:48:49,873 --> 00:48:51,841
"to hitherto-unthinkable
social institutions"

457
00:48:51,908 --> 00:48:54,775
"Maybe it'll take a movie to tell us
what the police is doing"

458
00:49:27,911 --> 00:49:29,879
None of them

459
00:49:35,919 --> 00:49:41,721
Why would anyone want to kill you?
- That's what I don't understand either

460
00:49:42,892 --> 00:49:44,985
I'm only a simple businessman

461
00:49:47,897 --> 00:49:50,866
What business are you in?
- Export-import

462
00:49:52,035 --> 00:49:56,802
Must be a cash-rich business?
- Provides me my bread and butter

463
00:49:58,908 --> 00:50:01,809
"And something more, I'm sure"

464
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:10,875
How long have you known Sharma?
- Who is Sharma?

465
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:17,016
R.K. Sharma.
- He's in your line of business.

466
00:50:19,996 --> 00:50:21,964
"Malik doesn't know him,
I've met him a couple of times"

467
00:50:22,031 --> 00:50:24,829
Who are you?
- I'm Vilas Pandit

468
00:50:24,968 --> 00:50:27,801
What do you do?
- I look after Malik's businesses

469
00:50:31,774 --> 00:50:34,971
And you are the one
who saved his life?

470
00:50:38,915 --> 00:50:39,973
Why?

471
00:50:41,017 --> 00:50:42,985
What do you mean why?

472
00:50:49,792 --> 00:50:51,851
What's your name?
- Chandu

473
00:50:52,762 --> 00:50:54,957
Full name.
- Chandrakant Nagre

474
00:50:56,032 --> 00:50:59,798
How long are you working for them?
- Just started

475
00:50:59,903 --> 00:51:01,871
Did I ask you?

476
00:51:05,942 --> 00:51:09,002
"Whoever you ask,
the answer will be the same"

477
00:51:12,816 --> 00:51:14,841
What's your interest
in the fiIm business?

478
00:51:15,018 --> 00:51:18,784
Only acquaintances.
At parties

479
00:51:22,992 --> 00:51:25,757
May we take the excuse
to make an acquaintance?

480
00:51:27,931 --> 00:51:33,892
I only regret not being able
to nab your assassin

481
00:51:34,037 --> 00:51:41,876
No matter. Your hard work is showing.
- No hard work. I'm all for you

482
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,949
May we leave?

483
00:52:08,005 --> 00:52:10,996
"Yadav, I found out.
He's Soorti's man."

484
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:15,879
When did Soorti start soaring?

485
00:52:16,045 --> 00:52:18,775
I'm wondering too.
Let's talk when we meet

486
00:52:19,817 --> 00:52:21,943
Still can't figure out
how Soorti dared

487
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:26,853
Take out Soorti and all his men.
For the next decade...

488
00:52:26,923 --> 00:52:31,883
daring ought to be a dreadful word

489
00:52:33,997 --> 00:52:36,795
Has a brother-in-law in Bangalore

490
00:52:37,868 --> 00:52:41,929
"Perhaps a brother in Hyderabad too.
Shambhu, this is Vilas Pandit"

491
00:52:42,773 --> 00:52:44,740
"Soorti has a brother living
in Hyderabad, doesn't he?"

492
00:52:44,974 --> 00:52:48,968
Cousin? AIso someone in Nagpur?

493
00:52:50,913 --> 00:52:53,815
Why are you shoving?
- I know

494
00:52:53,916 --> 00:53:00,982
You're the one who shot at him.
I also know why he didn't identify you

495
00:53:01,824 --> 00:53:06,761
"Had I done anything, why wouldn't they
identify me? You talk such rot"

496
00:53:08,932 --> 00:53:15,734
Because they would have to answer
too many questions. I know...

497
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,865
there must be so many problems

498
00:53:22,912 --> 00:53:27,873
"UntiI you tell me what's happening,
I'm not letting you walk"

499
00:53:29,919 --> 00:53:32,753
This is too much!

500
00:53:33,924 --> 00:53:35,983
The police can't hold
anyone without evidence

501
00:53:36,026 --> 00:53:40,861
And I know that.
- Who told you...

502
00:53:40,964 --> 00:53:43,865
that the police always stays
within the confines of the law?.

503
00:53:47,036 --> 00:53:52,737
I could never take the pain.
But maybe you're used?

504
00:53:55,779 --> 00:53:57,804
To tell you the truth...

505
00:53:57,914 --> 00:54:02,875
at times even I'm scared of the
men under me

506
00:54:02,986 --> 00:54:07,980
"But what to do? We got to do it,
for the job, they and I too"

507
00:54:08,892 --> 00:54:12,828
You'll know. You got ajob
in the gang too

508
00:54:12,995 --> 00:54:17,899
You think you'll lose yourjob
if you tell us anything?

509
00:54:18,768 --> 00:54:20,930
You're out of ajob
in any case

510
00:54:23,906 --> 00:54:29,868
"You see, you won't be able to endure
the pain and keep mum all night"

511
00:54:30,914 --> 00:54:39,788
"But still, even if you manage,
I'll pump a bullet into your head"

512
00:54:40,023 --> 00:54:44,790
"By tomorrow morning, after what
they have done to you..."

513
00:54:44,895 --> 00:54:50,958
"I can't let you walk out
and sue them, can I?"

514
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:57,805
I think you should just tell me
who's behind all this

515
00:54:59,843 --> 00:55:02,004
He went to collect
protection money

516
00:55:08,886 --> 00:55:09,978
What happened?

517
00:55:14,891 --> 00:55:16,860
I never said this before

518
00:55:19,997 --> 00:55:25,958
Whatever you did for Malik
that day at the movie shoot...

519
00:55:27,004 --> 00:55:29,905
Anyone else in my place
would've done that

520
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:35,000
"When I'm talking, you listen.
- What's the discussion?"

521
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:41,843
"Malik, had Chandu not been around..."

522
00:55:45,823 --> 00:55:49,782
"Don't get emotional.
- But it's true, isn't it?"

523
00:55:51,895 --> 00:55:53,829
"True, isn't it?"

524
00:55:53,997 --> 00:55:55,862
Isn't it?

525
00:56:04,975 --> 00:56:06,943
Come off it Malikbhai...

526
00:56:07,778 --> 00:56:09,905
He's offering you his hand.
Take it

527
00:56:26,897 --> 00:56:32,995
From Hyderabad. Soorti is gone.
- And his brother?

528
00:56:34,037 --> 00:56:39,805
Should be dead by four thirty.
- End of the story

529
00:56:39,877 --> 00:56:43,779
That's what they thought
when they attacked us at the studio

530
00:56:44,815 --> 00:56:49,775
"In our business, nothing ever gets over.
- Only lives get over"

531
00:56:50,888 --> 00:56:53,948
Anyone who takes his eye
off the game is gone

532
00:56:54,892 --> 00:57:00,853
"Malik, stop talking about business.
- Chandu, have you told Malik?"

533
00:57:01,899 --> 00:57:03,867
No...
- What's up?

534
00:57:03,967 --> 00:57:06,800
He's getting married.
- Getting married?

535
00:57:07,905 --> 00:57:10,840
You never told me?
- I was about to

536
00:57:10,908 --> 00:57:13,877
But then everything went haywire.
- Get us a champagne

537
00:57:14,912 --> 00:57:18,871
He's progressing in life only
because you're patronising him

538
00:57:19,016 --> 00:57:22,975
No one patronises anyone.
Everyone gets what he deserves

539
00:57:24,855 --> 00:57:27,881
Still... the oiI doesn't pour out
all by itself

540
00:57:36,867 --> 00:57:38,892
"No, I'm fine.
- That means I'm not fine?"

541
00:57:39,903 --> 00:57:41,837
Come on Malikbhai

542
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:47,943
He was so shy talking about you.
You should've seen him

543
00:57:48,011 --> 00:57:51,879
He's so shy.
Doesn't even talk properly

544
00:57:55,752 --> 00:58:00,883
One more...
- There were two earlier

545
00:58:02,025 --> 00:58:04,755
Don't even bother
trying to understand him

546
00:58:07,998 --> 00:58:09,898
More?
- No thanks

547
00:58:11,902 --> 00:58:14,996
When is the wedding?
- 2nd December

548
00:58:44,868 --> 00:58:45,892
GadgiI

549
00:58:47,938 --> 00:58:48,996
Yes?

550
00:59:00,917 --> 00:59:02,817
He's here

551
00:59:12,896 --> 00:59:15,865
Mr GadgiI? Come

552
00:59:18,735 --> 00:59:20,703
Sit

553
00:59:22,906 --> 00:59:24,874
What would you like to have?

554
00:59:26,943 --> 00:59:30,003
"No formalities, what would you like?
Coffee or tea?"

555
00:59:33,917 --> 00:59:41,756
Why have you brought me here?
- You're too busy to pay me a visit

556
00:59:41,892 --> 00:59:46,829
"But we must, for the sakes of big men
like you. Besides, you don't like..."

557
00:59:46,897 --> 00:59:53,735
coming to a police station?
- Just ask me what you want to know

558
00:59:53,837 --> 00:59:59,833
Just because we're policemen doesn't
mean that we're always asking

559
01:00:00,911 --> 01:00:03,937
Sometimes we might have something
to tell you

560
01:00:04,981 --> 01:00:08,815
What are you telling me?
- I'm telling you...

561
01:00:08,919 --> 01:00:14,824
who tipped off Soorti about Malik.
- Who tipped him off?

562
01:00:15,926 --> 01:00:23,799
"You did. If Malik gets to know,
you're dead before the hour is over"

563
01:00:26,002 --> 01:00:32,908
But I've no interest in seeing you dead.
I only want to see Malik in jaiI

564
01:00:33,777 --> 01:00:36,803
I know you were there when
Sharma and Rathod were killed

565
01:00:37,914 --> 01:00:43,819
"Just turn witness for the prosecution,
depose against Malik in court"

566
01:00:43,987 --> 01:00:45,955
Will you do it?

567
01:00:48,892 --> 01:00:50,860
You got any other choices?

568
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:03,997
Looks like it's going to rain.
- Yes so?

569
01:01:05,909 --> 01:01:09,811
"What do you mean "so"?
- Is that something to be discussed?"

570
01:01:13,817 --> 01:01:18,880
You're really a Satan.
- There's a Satan in everyone

571
01:01:19,789 --> 01:01:21,882
Only some people...
- You've said that before

572
01:01:32,836 --> 01:01:34,895
Are you about to say that
it has begun raining?

573
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:43,776
"Arrest warrant, sir.
For Malik and Chandrakant"

574
01:01:47,017 --> 01:01:49,884
This must be kept between
the three of us

575
01:01:56,993 --> 01:02:03,990
"Come unto me,
you needn't even ask"

576
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:29,891
"Give me something
to remember"

577
01:02:35,899 --> 01:02:38,767
Live in my eyes...

578
01:02:38,902 --> 01:02:41,803
lie in my embrace...

579
01:02:41,972 --> 01:02:44,873
linger on my lips...

580
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:47,933
or live in my heart

581
01:03:28,918 --> 01:03:30,887
What are you doing?

582
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:58,971
What do you want?
- Where is Chandu

583
01:03:59,816 --> 01:04:00,977
I told you! He isn't at home

584
01:04:01,986 --> 01:04:04,886
Confirmed news.
They have left for Hong Kong

585
01:04:07,891 --> 01:04:14,855
"I know. Nawlekarjust told me.
Chandrakant is abroad, honeymooning"

586
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:17,867
His mother told me

587
01:04:19,035 --> 01:04:25,839
But one thing I don't understand.
None but the three of us...

588
01:04:25,909 --> 01:04:32,872
ever knew of the raid. How come
they knew?. That was the question...

589
01:04:32,983 --> 01:04:38,819
on my mind when I asked for a listing
from the telephone department. Guess

590
01:04:38,922 --> 01:04:43,985
Which number called Chandu's residence
just before the raid?

591
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:03,971
"Internal injuries don't show up,
but they hurt like hell"

592
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:12,822
"So we flopped on the arrest. But at
least, we've driven them out of India"

593
01:05:15,926 --> 01:05:18,792
But Sreenivasan was wrong

594
01:05:19,996 --> 01:05:23,797
For years Malik had been
preparing for this day

595
01:05:30,941 --> 01:05:36,743
"David, his man Friday had created
a new haven for him, far from Mumbai"

596
01:05:36,914 --> 01:05:39,781
"Yes, it stinks.
But it's business"

597
01:05:52,997 --> 01:05:55,932
Hong Kong became the gang's
new residence

598
01:06:00,938 --> 01:06:02,996
"Malikbhai, GadgiI is dead"

599
01:07:26,924 --> 01:07:31,861
"After setting up home,
the gang got back to business"

600
01:07:36,033 --> 01:07:39,992
The telephone became the biggest weapon
in the undetworld

601
01:07:52,917 --> 01:07:57,877
Malik realised that the fear of death
was more potent than death

602
01:08:00,925 --> 01:08:04,884
He pissed when he saw.
He started mock attacks

603
01:08:08,966 --> 01:08:09,990
Terror struck

604
01:08:11,936 --> 01:08:17,772
Businessmen started huge ransoms
for fear of their lives

605
01:08:20,778 --> 01:08:21,972
If the need arose...

606
01:08:22,947 --> 01:08:24,915
Malik managed to get away
even with real kills

607
01:08:25,015 --> 01:08:26,812
Want to get shot?

608
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:28,784
I'm not scared of your threats

609
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:31,913
"Unknown faces, boys..."

610
01:08:32,022 --> 01:08:36,015
shot the quarry and disappeared

611
01:08:37,928 --> 01:08:41,887
They went back
to their small towns...

612
01:08:41,999 --> 01:08:46,993
from where they were recruited
for pittances

613
01:08:48,906 --> 01:08:50,965
The gang was never short of friends

614
01:08:52,843 --> 01:08:59,908
"In police, in customs, in government,
in the press, everywhere"

615
01:09:00,918 --> 01:09:06,788
"But Malik wasn't stopping here.
Construction, stockmarket..."

616
01:09:06,924 --> 01:09:10,985
the gang wanted a legal share
in every moneyspinner

617
01:09:11,795 --> 01:09:13,888
"Trust me, let me see what I can do"

618
01:09:15,899 --> 01:09:17,799
Buy or grab

619
01:09:18,802 --> 01:09:20,895
As the buying and grabbing went on...

620
01:09:21,805 --> 01:09:25,832
distinctions between the legal
and the illegal were blurred

621
01:09:27,778 --> 01:09:33,739
"In their penchant for the melodrama,
the press dubbed the gang "Company"

622
01:09:37,921 --> 01:09:42,949
Sreenivasan was doing all he could
to smash the gang's new avatar...

623
01:09:43,961 --> 01:09:45,792
apprehending men...

624
01:09:45,863 --> 01:09:46,955
arms caches...

625
01:09:49,833 --> 01:09:51,801
stemmed the fund flows...

626
01:09:55,906 --> 01:09:57,965
even targeted the legal businesses

627
01:09:59,810 --> 01:10:06,739
"But he knew, he was treating
a sick man, not a malaise"

628
01:10:10,954 --> 01:10:17,860
And the epidemic spread.
Malik concentrated on alliances...

629
01:10:17,928 --> 01:10:20,795
"with gangs overseas,
to promote his Company"

630
01:10:26,904 --> 01:10:29,873
Mumbai was left to Chandu

631
01:10:42,753 --> 01:10:44,880
Why do you want to talk to Chandu?
I'm telling you

632
01:10:51,995 --> 01:10:54,759
"Okay, I'll get Chandu bhai
to talk to you"

633
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,995
What happened?

634
01:10:58,902 --> 01:11:01,803
After so many years in the business
what are we doing?

635
01:11:03,907 --> 01:11:06,000
Now Ali insists on talking to
Chandu bhai

636
01:11:07,911 --> 01:11:11,779
What are we here for? Sweeping floors?
- Don't make mountains out of molehills

637
01:11:11,915 --> 01:11:15,976
"Molehills? Mumbai is all agog
about "Chandu bhai"

638
01:11:18,021 --> 01:11:19,989
Malikbhai is all but forgotten

639
01:11:31,969 --> 01:11:36,963
Yadav can't overcome his jealousy.
His problem about Chandu...

640
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:40,737
is the same problem Saeed and Sharma
had with me

641
01:11:41,912 --> 01:11:46,849
I can understand. But I'm apprehensive
about leaving all the controls...

642
01:11:46,917 --> 01:11:49,886
in the hands of one man.
We should not be repeating...

643
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,821
the mistake Aslam bhai made
about you

644
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,827
"No, I'm not saying that I'm suspicious
about Chandu"

645
01:11:59,997 --> 01:12:03,831
But why leave the scope
for such an eventuality?

646
01:12:16,947 --> 01:12:18,915
Krishnan!
- Hi Joseph

647
01:12:18,982 --> 01:12:21,883
This is David. David Khan.
He's close to Malikbhai

648
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,979
Don't go by the name.
Maybe he's mix breed

649
01:12:25,989 --> 01:12:28,890
Krishnan? Where did you come from?
- I've called him

650
01:12:31,028 --> 01:12:34,964
"You know Krishnan, Chandu's workload
is staggering. So I thought..."

651
01:12:34,998 --> 01:12:37,967
why don't you share a bit of it.
- What do you mean?

652
01:12:38,802 --> 01:12:41,965
"Take over Kurla, Chembur,
Ghatkopar, Vikhroli"

653
01:12:42,773 --> 01:12:44,968
Report directly to me.
You needn't trouble Chandu

654
01:12:47,811 --> 01:12:49,802
What are you gaping at?
You got a promotion

655
01:12:49,947 --> 01:12:51,915
When are you throwing a party?

656
01:12:55,986 --> 01:12:57,954
"Chandu, what's all this?
- What?"

657
01:12:58,021 --> 01:13:02,890
Am I to be an underling to Krishnan?
- What's this about being an underling?

658
01:13:03,794 --> 01:13:08,822
"You know I don't get along with him.
- What are you, a kid?"

659
01:13:08,966 --> 01:13:11,867
Am I asking you to marry Krishnan?
It's plain business

660
01:13:11,969 --> 01:13:14,995
What's this all of a sudden?
Any trouble out there?

661
01:13:15,906 --> 01:13:21,003
What trouble? You're a crackpot.
Don't you ever get anything straight?

662
01:13:21,945 --> 01:13:25,005
"The business is growing,
we got to work properly"

663
01:13:25,916 --> 01:13:30,012
I'm crowded with these little things.
I'm just passing over a bit to him

664
01:13:30,921 --> 01:13:33,014
Now stop thinking too hard

665
01:13:37,928 --> 01:13:39,953
What ajoker! Talks nonsense

666
01:13:40,030 --> 01:13:44,023
He was always like this.
Don't take any tensions

667
01:13:49,006 --> 01:13:50,974
Strangle him

668
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:54,969
But Chandu is mad about kids

669
01:13:57,047 --> 01:13:59,948
Kids? What kids?

670
01:14:00,785 --> 01:14:02,979
Yes Yadav? You like kids?

671
01:14:03,887 --> 01:14:07,722
"Kids! How pure at heart,
everyone likes kids"

672
01:14:08,025 --> 01:14:10,823
But if I could have my way
damn them all

673
01:14:10,995 --> 01:14:14,794
Are you out of your mind?
Is this any humour?

674
01:14:15,899 --> 01:14:17,867
He fancies poetry

675
01:14:20,003 --> 01:14:24,873
Not poetry. He has a tragedy.
Want to know?.

676
01:14:27,778 --> 01:14:32,010
"Tell me, come on.
- Back home in the village..."

677
01:14:32,916 --> 01:14:35,885
Stop raving!
- Just telling the sisters

678
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:39,889
He stepped inside the well
for taking a bath

679
01:14:40,023 --> 01:14:43,982
"Shut up, or I'll hit you!
- Let him finish"

680
01:14:45,896 --> 01:14:48,865
The kids stole all his clothes

681
01:14:49,901 --> 01:14:53,859
"Shut up, shut up I say"

682
01:14:54,938 --> 01:15:00,809
And when he was walking home
hiding behind plantain leaves...

683
01:15:00,911 --> 01:15:03,937
the goats went for him.
- I'm not sparing you

684
01:15:04,848 --> 01:15:07,784
What do you think of yourself?
Just you wait

685
01:15:11,923 --> 01:15:18,794
"What don? Just because I've fled
some place abroad, I become a don?"

686
01:15:19,797 --> 01:15:24,961
We are the ones who make the company.
The real don is the one who shoots

687
01:15:25,936 --> 01:15:28,804
"And what do we get out of it?
Ten, fifteen thousand?"

688
01:15:29,006 --> 01:15:31,874
He makes millions
just over telephone

689
01:15:33,777 --> 01:15:35,938
Shouting orders over the telephone
makes somebody a don?

690
01:15:36,748 --> 01:15:39,979
I'm calling Malikbhai
and I'll tell him...

691
01:15:40,784 --> 01:15:42,843
I'm the don over here
and what do you say to that?

692
01:15:43,021 --> 01:15:45,887
"I guarantee, Malikbhai
will be zapped"

693
01:15:46,891 --> 01:15:50,986
These buiIders are complaining
that the market has bottomed out

694
01:15:51,895 --> 01:15:54,864
"Ask them for money and they say,
kill me, I haven't the money"

695
01:15:54,999 --> 01:15:57,865
"Can't do that, can we?
We know they're in dire straits"

696
01:15:58,001 --> 01:16:01,869
And these fiIm-wallahs
talk about millions in papers

697
01:16:02,006 --> 01:16:03,939
"Look in their pockets,
you won't find a cent"

698
01:16:04,007 --> 01:16:07,841
But our expenses are the same.
150 guys to be paid every month

699
01:16:07,944 --> 01:16:11,971
So what do I do?
- Who's asking you to do anything?

700
01:16:13,016 --> 01:16:15,746
It's my birthday today and
this is all you can talk about?

701
01:16:15,819 --> 01:16:17,913
I brought you here because
it's your birthday

702
01:16:18,022 --> 01:16:21,787
Are you doing me a favour?
I thought you'd propose...

703
01:16:22,025 --> 01:16:23,925
"forget it,
I got to tell you everything"

704
01:16:23,995 --> 01:16:27,726
You do? Who brought you here? I did

705
01:16:28,765 --> 01:16:31,734
"Come on, now tell me.
- It isn't like that Chandu"

706
01:16:32,903 --> 01:16:36,772
"Tell me, have you ever
given me a gift?"

707
01:16:37,841 --> 01:16:40,776
"What do you want?
Tell me, right now"

708
01:16:40,878 --> 01:16:45,781
"There, I got to tell you everything.
- How will I know unless you tell me?"

709
01:16:46,784 --> 01:16:50,014
"When one is in love, he knows.
- You mean I don't love you?"

710
01:16:50,955 --> 01:16:55,891
"Right.
- Okay, I don't love you"

711
01:16:56,827 --> 01:16:58,796
I had to tell you that too

712
01:17:01,898 --> 01:17:03,833
Drop it Chandu

713
01:17:05,002 --> 01:17:07,732
Let it be. Forget it

714
01:17:07,938 --> 01:17:10,772
Drop it.
- AIways at a whim?

715
01:17:10,907 --> 01:17:12,876
"If you want to pick a fight,
you want to patch up, it's all fine?"

716
01:17:12,944 --> 01:17:14,969
"What am I, a machine?
Press the button"

717
01:17:15,746 --> 01:17:18,874
"Chandu, when you're angry,
you look just like Amol Palekar"

718
01:17:22,887 --> 01:17:24,854
I love it

719
01:17:27,959 --> 01:17:31,758
"Now come off it, drop it,
come back, on-line"

720
01:17:32,997 --> 01:17:35,965
You won't stop being angry?
You know what I'll do?

721
01:17:37,902 --> 01:17:39,870
You won't?

722
01:17:43,908 --> 01:17:46,900
"Are you mad?
- In a foreign land, anything goes"

723
01:17:54,017 --> 01:17:57,010
"Chandu, Malik wants to see you."

724
01:18:00,024 --> 01:18:00,990
Right now

725
01:18:09,901 --> 01:18:14,770
Warsi? Warsi would never say that
about Malikbhai! Out of question

726
01:18:25,816 --> 01:18:31,982
"What don? Just because I've fled
some place abroad, I become a don?"

727
01:18:33,791 --> 01:18:38,854
We are the ones who make the company.
The real don is the one who shoots

728
01:18:39,964 --> 01:18:42,762
"And what do we get out of it?
Ten, fifteen thousand?"

729
01:18:43,768 --> 01:18:45,827
He makes millions
just over telephone

730
01:18:47,038 --> 01:18:49,836
Shouting orders over the telephone
makes somebody a don?

731
01:18:50,041 --> 01:18:52,009
I'm calling Malikbhai
and I'll tell him...

732
01:18:52,843 --> 01:18:55,778
I'm the don over here
and what do you say to that?

733
01:18:57,014 --> 01:18:59,881
"I guarantee, Malikbhai
will be zapped"

734
01:19:14,799 --> 01:19:15,959
Put Warsi on the line

735
01:19:18,803 --> 01:19:20,998
"Warsi, talk to Chandu"

736
01:19:24,775 --> 01:19:30,736
"Warsi, what have you done?
- I was a bit drunk"

737
01:19:30,881 --> 01:19:35,875
I might've said something.
How would I know I'm being taped?

738
01:19:36,787 --> 01:19:39,950
Are you mad?
- My mistake Chandu bhai

739
01:19:40,958 --> 01:19:44,018
Who doesn't make mistakes?
They held a gun at my head...

740
01:19:44,795 --> 01:19:46,990
and they dragged me out
of my house. But...

741
01:19:58,009 --> 01:20:02,969
"In my business, forgiving
such a mistake is a worse mistake"

742
01:20:14,792 --> 01:20:19,752
I don't know. They're saying he must've
been one of the Soortis or Karlekars

743
01:20:21,799 --> 01:20:28,967
"Wouldn't know. Yes, Chandu spoke to
Warsi's brother. Yes, money was sent"

744
01:20:42,787 --> 01:20:47,884
All Malik's fault.
Everything was going on fine

745
01:20:49,827 --> 01:20:54,958
Why did he start this Krishnan mess?
That's why Warsi was incensed

746
01:20:57,001 --> 01:20:59,993
He wasn't mad was he?

747
01:21:03,007 --> 01:21:03,996
Bloody mental

748
01:21:08,779 --> 01:21:09,905
Friend of mine

749
01:21:12,850 --> 01:21:15,819
One mistake and he's dead

750
01:21:17,755 --> 01:21:22,749
Do you think Malik is a demon
who enjoys killing people?

751
01:21:33,003 --> 01:21:39,772
Get this straight. The company
stands on one thing. That's fear

752
01:21:43,781 --> 01:21:47,842
"If Warsi was let off,
ten others would've spoken out"

753
01:21:48,986 --> 01:21:51,819
Malik is responsible
for the entire company

754
01:21:52,990 --> 01:21:56,983
He can't spare someone who flouts
company rules

755
01:21:57,995 --> 01:22:03,763
"Be it Warsi, be it you,
be it me"

756
01:22:12,777 --> 01:22:17,771
No tea or coffee for a guest?
- I'll get you. Tea of coffee?

757
01:22:18,783 --> 01:22:21,013
"Tea?
Listen, is there any food?"

758
01:22:21,852 --> 01:22:23,820
"Chandu, would you like
to eat something?"

759
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:44,935
"Chandu, go to Switzerland.
Meet Nalin Raote"

760
01:22:45,776 --> 01:22:48,802
Relationships with politicians
can be profitable

761
01:22:49,013 --> 01:22:52,813
"Malik wanted to go, but there's this
meeting with South Africans"

762
01:22:54,752 --> 01:22:59,985
"Remember, Raote is big fish.
He might end up becoming big croc"

763
01:23:01,792 --> 01:23:03,783
People want to invest billions in our
state and instead of welcoming them...

764
01:23:03,928 --> 01:23:07,864
we make them run around
in circles?

765
01:23:09,033 --> 01:23:10,830
What a shame

766
01:23:14,805 --> 01:23:16,773
I'm returning to India tomorrow

767
01:23:17,007 --> 01:23:17,974
Sit

768
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:25,749
See me with the case file

769
01:23:27,985 --> 01:23:31,853
I think you should see
Thakur in Delhi

770
01:23:31,989 --> 01:23:34,856
Environment clearances
are tough nowadays

771
01:23:34,992 --> 01:23:36,892
The rest of the papers?

772
01:23:38,796 --> 01:23:39,990
"Tea, coffee?"

773
01:23:42,766 --> 01:23:44,825
"No, that won't be required
at this stage"

774
01:23:45,002 --> 01:23:46,993
Too much paperwork
might not be good

775
01:23:53,010 --> 01:23:54,739
Well all right

776
01:23:56,780 --> 01:23:58,748
I have heard much about you

777
01:24:00,818 --> 01:24:01,785
Praise

778
01:24:04,021 --> 01:24:07,787
You know PatiI?
- Home minister?

779
01:24:10,928 --> 01:24:15,991
"He's a bit of a problem.
- Belongs to your party, doesn't he?"

780
01:24:20,004 --> 01:24:21,972
I want him out of my way

781
01:24:25,976 --> 01:24:28,911
Got to be killed?
- No not killed

782
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:34,808
"He's a big man, it'll become a scandal.
There might even be an inquiry"

783
01:24:41,825 --> 01:24:43,884
But he must die

784
01:24:56,040 --> 01:25:00,773
"Not to be killed,
not to be left alive"

785
01:25:01,979 --> 01:25:08,817
I don't think he's a proper guy.
- Are we proper guys?

786
01:25:14,825 --> 01:25:18,022
Is there a poison that won't
be detected in the post mortem?

787
01:25:18,862 --> 01:25:21,797
Make sure you write a story
for one of Akram's fiIms

788
01:25:23,901 --> 01:25:25,869
What if he has a fall?

789
01:25:29,773 --> 01:25:30,899
May we have coffee?

790
01:25:31,976 --> 01:25:35,742
What if there's a road accident?
- But how?.

791
01:25:36,847 --> 01:25:38,815
Accidents keep happening on highways

792
01:25:52,029 --> 01:25:54,964
What happens to the driver?
- He'll suffer some injuries

793
01:25:55,799 --> 01:25:58,962
"Better still if he dies.
- If he's caught, he'll own up"

794
01:25:59,803 --> 01:26:01,771
What's the sentence
for reckless driving?

795
01:26:01,872 --> 01:26:02,930
"Six, eight months?"

796
01:26:03,774 --> 01:26:06,004
"Yes it stinks.
But it's business"

797
01:26:31,035 --> 01:26:32,866
Kids too?

798
01:26:39,009 --> 01:26:41,774
Yes?
- Two kids with him

799
01:26:42,012 --> 01:26:44,777
"Kids?
- Yes, seven-eight year olds"

800
01:26:50,054 --> 01:26:51,919
I'll call you back

801
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:53,757
Where's Malki bhai?

802
01:26:53,858 --> 01:26:56,826
So?
- We got to kill PatiI

803
01:26:57,027 --> 01:27:01,965
Why mess with his kids?
- Not another chance. Kill him

804
01:27:07,806 --> 01:27:08,864
What happened?

805
01:27:29,994 --> 01:27:33,793
I don't feel right like killing kids.
- What's right and wrong about this?

806
01:27:33,965 --> 01:27:37,901
We only took a contract on PatiI.
- Add two names from my side

807
01:27:38,803 --> 01:27:39,963
Don't disturb me now

808
01:27:45,008 --> 01:27:46,874
What's the problem?

809
01:28:01,892 --> 01:28:04,020
This is David.
- Put Malikbhai on

810
01:28:05,029 --> 01:28:07,827
"Tell him it's me.
- Whoever, no calls"

811
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,769
Tell him I'm calling off
the contract

812
01:28:14,038 --> 01:28:17,804
Are you crazy?
- Shut up

813
01:28:19,777 --> 01:28:20,904
Has he gone senile?

814
01:28:30,755 --> 01:28:34,952
"Malikbhai, I don't know what's come
over him. He called off the contract"

815
01:28:35,827 --> 01:28:38,796
"Is Kenkre in place?
- Yes, he's there"

816
01:28:39,798 --> 01:28:41,958
"Yes Malikbhai, Chandu
called off the contract"

817
01:28:42,801 --> 01:28:44,734
I'm telling you. Do it

818
01:29:11,996 --> 01:29:14,760
Whom did you ask before
calling it off?

819
01:29:16,868 --> 01:29:19,996
I did what I felt was right.
- Who are you to decide?

820
01:29:20,839 --> 01:29:25,003
"When I'm doing something, I decide.
Did you ask me before killing Warsi?"

821
01:29:25,877 --> 01:29:29,779
All you said was it goes against
the company. Did I say anything?

822
01:29:29,947 --> 01:29:32,746
A hundred decision are made a day.
Am I asked before deciding?

823
01:29:32,884 --> 01:29:34,852
Decisions will taken according to
the needs of the company

824
01:29:34,986 --> 01:29:39,753
Not according to what you think.
- I'm part of the company too

825
01:29:39,891 --> 01:29:42,758
"Then stay with the company,
don't try to own it"

826
01:29:42,926 --> 01:29:45,953
Shut up you lackey!
- And what will you do to me?

827
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:48,993
I'll bury you alive!
- Who do you think you are?

828
01:29:49,868 --> 01:29:52,803
"Come off it Chandu, come on Yadav.
- Come to your senses, Chandu"

829
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:59,834
I'm just coming to my senses.
Now I see it all clearly

830
01:29:59,978 --> 01:30:01,945
You never saw it when
we picked you up from the streets?

831
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:04,839
"You did it for your gain, not mine"

832
01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:07,750
Do you think...

833
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:12,790
the company can't go on
without you?

834
01:30:23,801 --> 01:30:29,762
If the company can make do without me
I too can make do without the company

835
01:30:40,985 --> 01:30:45,820
Bloody cur! From day one I've been
saying I don't like this guy one bit

836
01:30:45,957 --> 01:30:48,858
"But you lost your mind,
you pampered him"

837
01:30:48,993 --> 01:30:52,861
"Now you see that bastard?
Malikbhai, just tell me..."

838
01:30:52,997 --> 01:30:54,965
I'll pump a whole magazine into him.
- Yadav

839
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,859
Malikbhai! I'll kill him!
- Have you gone mad?

840
01:30:58,002 --> 01:30:59,902
"Saroja, go inside.
- Malik he's..."

841
01:31:00,004 --> 01:31:00,971
Go inside

842
01:31:04,776 --> 01:31:05,743
But Malik...

843
01:31:26,798 --> 01:31:27,856
Kanu?
- Yes Saroja?

844
01:31:28,032 --> 01:31:30,967
Chandu will be coming over.
Take him and run away

845
01:31:31,769 --> 01:31:31,996
What?

846
01:31:32,837 --> 01:31:34,964
Send a few guys from Kowloon
over to Sayonara Hotel

847
01:31:35,773 --> 01:31:37,001
We'll kill him right there

848
01:31:41,846 --> 01:31:45,805
He's chiIdish. Malik you know him
and I know him too

849
01:31:46,017 --> 01:31:49,817
I'm going to haul him in by his ears
and I'm going to make him apologise

850
01:31:49,988 --> 01:31:51,922
"Come on David.
Yadav, you stay right here"

851
01:32:10,008 --> 01:32:11,976
What happened?
- Saroja called

852
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:14,836
She said Malik is in a rage.
- Tell me properly

853
01:32:15,013 --> 01:32:17,777
"She said, Malik is in a rage,
he might do anything"

854
01:32:17,882 --> 01:32:19,850
He's sending someone to kill you!
- What?

855
01:32:20,018 --> 01:32:22,816
"Chandu, I'm scared.
Let's go away from here"

856
01:32:29,794 --> 01:32:31,762
"Kanu, come on"

857
01:32:31,896 --> 01:32:35,798
"Come on David,
I'll kill you right here"

858
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,763
"Come on, out"

859
01:32:38,002 --> 01:32:41,802
I'll kill you and
I'll kill your Malik too

860
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:44,775
"Come on, I'll kill you"

861
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:48,973
"Come on, you coward!
Are you hiding?"

862
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:55,878
"Malikbhai, Chandu started shooting.
Panditji is down"

863
01:33:47,839 --> 01:33:50,740
Didn't even give him a chance to talk.
Just shot him

864
01:33:51,776 --> 01:33:54,745
You know what he said?
Said he'll kill Malikbhai too

865
01:34:02,854 --> 01:34:05,880
"What do you mean why?
I told you, he came to kill me"

866
01:34:06,023 --> 01:34:07,991
Came to kill Chandu

867
01:34:09,861 --> 01:34:13,797
Just let me make it to Bombay.
I'll show them who Chandu is

868
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:17,768
I'll let you know which flight
I'm taking

869
01:34:21,806 --> 01:34:24,775
"Yadav, any problems?"

870
01:34:27,778 --> 01:34:29,746
The problem is about to begin

871
01:34:30,982 --> 01:34:34,850
What do you mean?
- The word isn't out yet

872
01:34:34,986 --> 01:34:37,955
"But once word outs, no knowing
how the boys will take it"

873
01:34:38,789 --> 01:34:40,757
"His men will be incensed,
anything might happen"

874
01:34:40,892 --> 01:34:42,860
We aren't yet ready
for something so big

875
01:34:42,994 --> 01:34:45,986
"Listen to me, stay for a while
in some other country"

876
01:34:57,008 --> 01:35:01,911
"Malik, did you think Chandu
will die so easily?"

877
01:35:02,914 --> 01:35:06,941
Chandu won't die.
But you're going to be finished

878
01:35:07,818 --> 01:35:10,787
The blood that went into the making
of this company...

879
01:35:11,789 --> 01:35:14,758
will now go into destroying
this company

880
01:35:16,027 --> 01:35:21,966
"Malik, you and your company
are finished"

881
01:36:26,931 --> 01:36:31,959
Mumbai was dumbfounded at the news
of the split between Chandu and Malik

882
01:36:33,838 --> 01:36:36,830
No one knew what was happening

883
01:36:49,887 --> 01:36:52,856
Day and night Yadav was trying
to trace Chandu

884
01:36:54,825 --> 01:36:56,793
"Maybe to Kenya, Malaysia"

885
01:36:58,029 --> 01:37:03,831
He could be in Switzerland too.
- Find him

886
01:37:08,806 --> 01:37:13,937
Men have come and men have gone
but I never saw Malikbhai this way

887
01:37:15,012 --> 01:37:17,776
He never made such a big mistake

888
01:37:17,948 --> 01:37:20,815
"But I swear sister,
I'll set everything all right"

889
01:37:22,853 --> 01:37:26,983
Saroja hid it. But she was torn
by the feeling of remorse

890
01:37:28,793 --> 01:37:32,752
"In Mumbai, Rani was scared to death"

891
01:37:35,801 --> 01:37:37,826
"Chandu, what am I hearing?"

892
01:37:41,806 --> 01:37:44,969
But you said he's a nice guy.
- That was my mistake...

893
01:37:45,777 --> 01:37:47,835
taking him for a nice guy.
He belongs to no one

894
01:37:48,012 --> 01:37:51,914
All he thinks of is gain.
- But when he came home...

895
01:37:52,017 --> 01:37:54,985
"he looked like a nice guy, didn't he?
- Do you know more than I do?"

896
01:37:55,853 --> 01:38:01,814
"Look Chandu, right now you're hot
in the head. Think it over, properly"

897
01:38:01,993 --> 01:38:05,792
Don't you tell me what to do.
He and I have parted. Period

898
01:38:06,797 --> 01:38:11,757
"After PatiI died, Raote was the only
leader who could assume his position"

899
01:38:15,806 --> 01:38:17,775
That's why he had PatiI bumped off

900
01:38:20,779 --> 01:38:24,771
"After the two-minute silence,
he became home minister for 5 years"

901
01:39:03,954 --> 01:39:05,923
News of Raote drives me crazy

902
01:39:07,024 --> 01:39:09,858
Give the chair to someone
you ought to haul in?

903
01:39:10,761 --> 01:39:15,789
And now he's killing our boys.
Such justice

904
01:39:16,033 --> 01:39:17,933
And they call us undetworld

905
01:39:18,937 --> 01:39:22,963
At least we say it openly.
Politicians are doing it on the sly

906
01:39:23,809 --> 01:39:25,868
And they're raping
the whole country

907
01:39:53,804 --> 01:39:56,865
Hey Kanu...
- Coming. Stop screaming

908
01:39:57,007 --> 01:39:58,999
Come down.
- Hi Kawra! How are you?

909
01:39:59,844 --> 01:40:02,006
"Fine, look what the lady sends you"

910
01:40:04,014 --> 01:40:07,781
You'll laugh your guts out
when I tell you about Yadav

911
01:40:08,787 --> 01:40:13,747
Patel the money-launderer from Bandra
tipped Yadav off saying that...

912
01:40:13,892 --> 01:40:17,850
"Chandrakant is in Hotel Sheraton
in Bangkok, laundering money"

913
01:40:17,996 --> 01:40:20,965
Yadav calls up Bangkok
gives the chinks a contract

914
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:22,959
Man dies.
- Dead?

915
01:40:23,802 --> 01:40:26,771
Listen on. He does ajig
and he goes to see Malik

916
01:40:26,872 --> 01:40:31,900
But Malik was informed already.
The guy was some other Chandrakant

917
01:40:34,012 --> 01:40:36,912
Guess who? Someone who was working
for their distributor

918
01:40:37,015 --> 01:40:39,848
Really?
- The distributor was in a rage

919
01:40:39,985 --> 01:40:44,854
Malikbhai called him personally
and said let bygones be bygones

920
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:50,818
Now I hear Yadav is after Patel
for a wrong tip-off

921
01:40:51,996 --> 01:40:54,989
What a look he must be wearing.
- Looking for a place to hide his face

922
01:40:58,870 --> 01:41:00,997
Tip offs need not necessarily
be wrong every time

923
01:41:10,015 --> 01:41:11,879
Too much salt

924
01:41:13,952 --> 01:41:15,920
"Kanu, listen to me,
this is just the beginning"

925
01:41:16,787 --> 01:41:18,813
Yes I'm in Kenya
and they don't know yet

926
01:41:18,957 --> 01:41:20,982
That they'll never find out
is no foregone conclusion

927
01:41:21,793 --> 01:41:24,762
"If something happens,
I can get out. But with you..."

928
01:41:24,895 --> 01:41:27,865
"For the last time, hear me out.
I'm not leaving you"

929
01:41:27,999 --> 01:41:29,966
"So let's die together, okay?"

930
01:41:43,782 --> 01:41:45,749
"Kanu...
- Not you, not again"

931
01:41:45,983 --> 01:41:50,818
"Try to understand. With you around,
he'll worry for you all the time"

932
01:41:51,790 --> 01:41:53,780
"If you're in Mumbai,
he will at least..."

933
01:41:54,826 --> 01:41:57,954
"And look, your staying on
is no advantage for us"

934
01:41:58,797 --> 01:41:59,855
Instead...

935
01:42:44,042 --> 01:42:50,914
"How are you, Kanu? I would've come
to receive you. But something came up"

936
01:42:51,783 --> 01:42:53,751
No problem. Let's meet tomorrow
or day after

937
01:43:03,795 --> 01:43:07,754
How is it going?
- The mess has shaken up everything

938
01:43:07,932 --> 01:43:10,901
"Everyone is taking sides,
the police, customs, everyone"

939
01:43:11,836 --> 01:43:15,772
As if someone used a sword
to slash the business in two

940
01:43:16,875 --> 01:43:21,869
Businessmen are cribbing about having
to pay two instead of one

941
01:43:22,781 --> 01:43:24,749
Nothing's spared.
Take my movie

942
01:43:24,949 --> 01:43:30,910
My hero says Yadav told him not to work
in my movie. And I told him...

943
01:43:31,790 --> 01:43:34,816
"if he doesn't come at 9 tomorrow,
by two o'clock I'll have him shot"

944
01:43:38,763 --> 01:43:43,757
What can we do?
- What do you mean? Stop them

945
01:43:44,769 --> 01:43:50,002
How?. He's out of India.
- Do something

946
01:43:51,776 --> 01:43:56,975
"Why not ask this other friend of yours,
this Malik, to provide you security?"

947
01:43:57,816 --> 01:44:03,015
"I'm a fiImstar, I meet a hundred guys,
doesn't mean everyone is my friend"

948
01:44:03,988 --> 01:44:07,981
"Yes, I might've said a hello
or a hi to Malik sometime"

949
01:44:08,860 --> 01:44:14,799
I have 42 tapes of your hellos
with him. Want to hear?

950
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:23,030
"So you see, friendship lasts
as long as it lasts"

951
01:44:27,912 --> 01:44:31,746
"Sawant, provide him
with a security detaiI"

952
01:44:37,922 --> 01:44:39,856
I hear the police
are about to arrest you

953
01:44:39,991 --> 01:44:42,789
Absolutely incorrect.
Where do you get these news?

954
01:44:42,927 --> 01:44:45,020
Is it also true that the undetworld
is financing your movies?

955
01:44:45,864 --> 01:44:48,833
Absolutely false. Malicious gossip.
- The shootout on the sets...

956
01:44:48,967 --> 01:44:50,935
clearly establishes the relationship
between fiIm industry and the undetworld

957
01:44:51,736 --> 01:44:54,899
I've told you before.
Some guest was shot at

958
01:44:55,774 --> 01:44:57,935
How come you're here?
- On behalf of the fiIm industry...

959
01:44:58,777 --> 01:45:00,745
I was talking about
the police welfare fund

960
01:45:09,854 --> 01:45:11,981
Why did you go to the police?
- What else am I to do?

961
01:45:12,857 --> 01:45:15,951
Yadav tells me not to shoot
for the fiIm

962
01:45:16,828 --> 01:45:20,764
"Akram tells me, if I don't
he'll kill me"

963
01:45:20,999 --> 01:45:25,800
"Tell me, what am I to do?
- You're a friend"

964
01:45:26,971 --> 01:45:28,836
I'll take care of everything

965
01:45:29,941 --> 01:45:32,933
What do you mean Chandu bhai?
My climax set is up

966
01:45:33,778 --> 01:45:36,941
Release dates have been announced
and he says he won't shoot

967
01:45:37,782 --> 01:45:41,912
"And you tell me not to say anything?
- Akram, listen"

968
01:45:42,821 --> 01:45:46,814
"Naved Khan, poor fellow is in a fix.
They're pumping him too, aren't they?"

969
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:52,856
"Just cancel this shoot,
postpone the release"

970
01:45:53,832 --> 01:45:55,766
We'll fix things later

971
01:45:56,768 --> 01:45:58,827
"Very well, as you think best"

972
01:46:07,879 --> 01:46:11,747
But why did he kill Akram?

973
01:46:14,853 --> 01:46:18,880
Chandu listen to me. Killing
Naved Khan will give us bad publicity

974
01:46:19,757 --> 01:46:21,987
"After Akram died, he has been given
so much police security..."

975
01:46:22,794 --> 01:46:25,820
the job will be tough
- What are you? An eunuch?

976
01:46:25,930 --> 01:46:28,990
Don't make excuses.
We got to show them now. Period

977
01:46:29,801 --> 01:46:31,996
Naved will die once the security
gets a bit lax

978
01:46:32,837 --> 01:46:34,805
We shouldn't be at the losing end

979
01:46:38,810 --> 01:46:42,007
"The man who supplies stuff to Malik
stays in Lokhandwala, doesn't he?"

980
01:46:43,781 --> 01:46:47,877
Don't be siIly! I know what Lateef
means to Malik. Why should I kill him?

981
01:46:48,753 --> 01:46:52,917
And am I his only man here?
Lots of them work for Chandu

982
01:46:53,791 --> 01:46:57,921
Krishnan would never lie to us.
Whoever did it...

983
01:46:59,797 --> 01:47:04,029
Chandu is behind it.
Have you spoken to Lateef's brother?

984
01:47:05,770 --> 01:47:11,936
Yes Malikbhai. He married just
2 years ago. He has a six-month baby

985
01:47:15,013 --> 01:47:19,006
"Who's this guy in Versova?
One of Chandu's punters, isn't he?"

986
01:47:27,792 --> 01:47:32,024
"Not him, you were supposed
to take out the guy in Parel"

987
01:47:52,784 --> 01:47:53,808
Checked him out?

988
01:47:53,918 --> 01:47:56,011
Don't make me mad!

989
01:47:56,854 --> 01:47:58,754
Kill all of them

990
01:48:22,046 --> 01:48:25,880
I called the hospital.
He'll be dead in 4 or 5 hours

991
01:48:37,829 --> 01:48:39,763
"Think it over, once again"

992
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:43,767
Yes

993
01:48:52,777 --> 01:48:54,938
"Told him so many times,
lie low for a while"

994
01:48:56,914 --> 01:49:00,782
What can I do now?.
What's done is done

995
01:49:01,786 --> 01:49:02,878
He's coming

996
01:49:08,961 --> 01:49:10,825
Whatever anyone says...

997
01:49:11,796 --> 01:49:13,787
each and every one of them...

998
01:49:14,832 --> 01:49:16,891
were connected to the undetworld

999
01:49:18,803 --> 01:49:24,833
"Malik, we fought wars too.
But not at the cost of the business"

1000
01:49:26,779 --> 01:49:31,738
You are destroying
the entire fraternity

1001
01:49:32,917 --> 01:49:35,886
The boys are scared to death

1002
01:49:36,989 --> 01:49:39,786
They are either caught
between the two of you...

1003
01:49:39,957 --> 01:49:45,988
"or the police is picking them off.
Malik, when will all this end?"

1004
01:49:47,799 --> 01:49:51,759
Tomorrow. I've found Chandu

1005
01:49:56,808 --> 01:49:58,970
I miss Kanu.
- Call her

1006
01:49:59,777 --> 01:50:03,736
Who says I can't?
I'm just telling you

1007
01:50:04,783 --> 01:50:05,840
Missing her

1008
01:50:25,937 --> 01:50:27,962
Marriage scares me worse
than the police

1009
01:50:28,773 --> 01:50:30,742
What's in marriage to be scared of?

1010
01:50:30,976 --> 01:50:33,876
Marriage is shooting yourself
in the foot

1011
01:50:34,012 --> 01:50:36,946
Have I shot myself?

1012
01:50:38,015 --> 01:50:42,749
"Look, before I married Kanu,
I never knew what I missed"

1013
01:50:42,988 --> 01:50:45,854
"Today, there's no one happier
than me in the whole world"

1014
01:50:52,798 --> 01:50:54,765
You died in an encounter

1015
01:51:04,810 --> 01:51:08,802
"But you're right about one thing.
After marriage, a man changes"

1016
01:51:10,014 --> 01:51:13,781
"Before you were married,
you were always looking for Kawra"

1017
01:51:14,018 --> 01:51:16,886
And now?. After the marriage?
It's Kanu-Kanu-Kanu

1018
01:51:17,021 --> 01:51:18,887
"Hey, you're going to get hit"

1019
01:51:23,762 --> 01:51:24,854
Get him

1020
01:51:26,798 --> 01:51:27,924
Where are the guns?
- Downstairs

1021
01:51:28,033 --> 01:51:30,763
After him

1022
01:51:31,836 --> 01:51:32,928
"Chandu, run"

1023
01:54:53,004 --> 01:54:54,767
How is this?

1024
01:55:30,976 --> 01:55:32,841
"When did you come, sister?"

1025
01:55:35,981 --> 01:55:39,917
"How are you?
- Fine, how are you, sister?"

1026
01:55:41,987 --> 01:55:42,919
Fine

1027
01:55:43,054 --> 01:55:47,889
Of course he was shot.
The cur! He must be dead

1028
01:56:04,976 --> 01:56:05,943
One spoon?

1029
01:56:10,982 --> 01:56:12,916
What if all this never happened?

1030
01:56:18,857 --> 01:56:20,757
How is Malikbhai?

1031
01:56:22,828 --> 01:56:23,795
Fine

1032
01:56:24,029 --> 01:56:25,997
Chandu?
- Okay

1033
01:56:26,998 --> 01:56:29,865
Never got a chance
to talk to you

1034
01:56:30,769 --> 01:56:33,829
But I'll never forget
how you helped me

1035
01:56:37,008 --> 01:56:37,975
When did you arrive?

1036
01:56:38,777 --> 01:56:43,737
"Kanu, come up! Quick!
Hurry"

1037
01:56:45,817 --> 01:56:48,809
What happened?
- I just saw on tv

1038
01:56:48,987 --> 01:56:50,887
What happened?
- On tv...

1039
01:56:51,056 --> 01:56:52,956
someone shot Chandu

1040
01:56:54,793 --> 01:56:55,760
Where?

1041
01:56:57,796 --> 01:56:58,785
I just saw it

1042
01:56:58,964 --> 01:57:01,762
Pappu here.
Any news of Chandu?

1043
01:57:01,867 --> 01:57:03,767
That button! Surf ahead

1044
01:57:04,936 --> 01:57:07,837
In an attack on his residence
in Nairobi

1045
01:57:08,006 --> 01:57:10,873
It's said that after being hit
by three bullets...

1046
01:57:11,009 --> 01:57:13,773
the chances of the survival of
undetworld don Chandu are very slim

1047
01:57:18,016 --> 01:57:22,919
We spoke to the officers there.
They say there are injuries

1048
01:57:23,054 --> 01:57:24,954
But he is out of danger

1049
01:57:27,792 --> 01:57:29,760
I'll talk to you later

1050
01:57:34,900 --> 01:57:38,768
"Try if you must, ten times over"

1051
01:57:42,007 --> 01:57:44,771
But kill that bastard Malik

1052
01:57:47,012 --> 01:57:50,778
"Do what you will, but kill Malik"

1053
01:57:52,784 --> 01:57:55,753
"Hush Chandu, relax"

1054
01:58:02,027 --> 01:58:04,791
"Yes, lady...
- Get me Chandu"

1055
01:58:06,798 --> 01:58:07,856
Chandu...

1056
01:58:10,869 --> 01:58:12,860
how are you?
- I'm fine

1057
01:58:14,906 --> 01:58:19,775
Why are you crying?
I told you I'm fine

1058
01:58:19,945 --> 01:58:23,779
Don't talk crap!
You took three hits

1059
01:58:24,749 --> 01:58:26,808
No bullets

1060
01:58:28,753 --> 01:58:30,721
I just watched on tv

1061
01:58:30,855 --> 01:58:33,756
Who knows more? Your tv or I?

1062
01:58:34,793 --> 01:58:35,782
Give me the phone

1063
01:58:35,927 --> 01:58:39,954
Now stop crying.
- Enough son

1064
01:58:40,799 --> 01:58:44,860
"Now come to a compromise.
For God's sake, stop it"

1065
01:58:45,003 --> 01:58:48,905
Stop what? It's just the beginning

1066
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:54,910
This time God has saved you.
- Give the phone to Pappu

1067
01:58:55,046 --> 01:58:56,877
"Chandu bhai, this bastard..."

1068
01:58:56,982 --> 01:59:03,785
Not a word. Krishnan is involved.
- Our Krishnan?

1069
01:59:03,989 --> 01:59:06,014
"I told you, listen"

1070
01:59:08,793 --> 01:59:15,756
Tell the boys to stay away from him.
I'll take care of the rest

1071
01:59:16,935 --> 01:59:17,902
Get me Kanu

1072
01:59:18,036 --> 01:59:20,004
"Chandu, what happened?"

1073
01:59:22,974 --> 01:59:25,772
You don't get started now

1074
01:59:27,812 --> 01:59:32,749
"You wanted top marry a hood,
didn't you? Now what?"

1075
01:59:34,853 --> 01:59:38,789
"Chandu, I want to come over.
- Don't be siIly, Kanu"

1076
01:59:39,858 --> 01:59:42,019
What will you do here?
- I just want to come over

1077
01:59:42,827 --> 01:59:47,764
I don't want to listen to anything.
- Kawra is here

1078
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:51,769
He'll take care of me.
- Why won't you listen?

1079
01:59:52,771 --> 01:59:56,764
Why won't you?
- Take care of my mother

1080
02:00:29,809 --> 02:00:34,837
The undetworld has reminded Mumbai
of it's presence once again

1081
02:00:34,979 --> 02:00:38,005
A Wadala market shopkeeper
has been assassinated

1082
02:00:38,817 --> 02:00:42,753
The deceased Krishnan Pillai
is said to have been connected with...

1083
02:00:42,887 --> 02:00:46,823
the Chandu-Malik gangs. This killing
could be a part of the gang war

1084
02:00:46,991 --> 02:00:51,860
No one knows when this happened.
But bystanders suspect...

1085
02:00:51,996 --> 02:00:54,965
a boy of 17 or 18 years.
According to the police...

1086
02:00:55,800 --> 02:00:59,862
some witnesses saw the boy often
in the company of the deceased

1087
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:02,932
The police are on the look out

1088
02:01:11,816 --> 02:01:15,878
On line from Hong Kong is
Ganesh Yadav of the Malik gang...

1089
02:01:16,020 --> 02:01:19,922
whose men reportedly tried to
assassinate Chandrakant in Hong Kong

1090
02:01:20,759 --> 02:01:23,853
What was the intention of the assault?
- Do I have to spell it out?

1091
02:01:24,796 --> 02:01:27,027
He bit the hand that fed him.
Got to tell...

1092
02:01:27,832 --> 02:01:29,959
what happens to traitors
in this business

1093
02:01:30,770 --> 02:01:35,001
But we hear he survived the attempt?
- Because he ran

1094
02:01:35,841 --> 02:01:37,832
"But now he can't even run.
What will he do now, the cur?"

1095
02:01:37,943 --> 02:01:40,934
"I've put him out of action.
In a while, I'll kill him too"

1096
02:01:41,780 --> 02:01:45,807
But he's under police protection.
- Damn police protection

1097
02:01:45,950 --> 02:01:50,853
We'll send him home minced.
Tell that cur on my behalf

1098
02:01:50,989 --> 02:01:52,980
Let him have a few last words
with his family

1099
02:01:53,825 --> 02:01:56,919
"Death is coming for him,
he's finished"

1100
02:02:14,780 --> 02:02:18,806
Are you insane? You think Malik
will spare Chandu on your say so?

1101
02:02:19,017 --> 02:02:22,953
You're being siIly.
- Yes I'm being siIly

1102
02:02:23,823 --> 02:02:28,886
"But please, listen to me, my sister.
Who else have I but Chandu? No one"

1103
02:02:30,796 --> 02:02:34,959
"Let me talk to Malikbhai, for once.
I'll tell Chandu to give up all this"

1104
02:02:35,767 --> 02:02:39,897
"He'll give it all up,
he won't do anything again"

1105
02:02:41,773 --> 02:02:45,767
"Sister, you helped me once.
For one last time, help me"

1106
02:02:45,944 --> 02:02:47,913
I won't ask for anything
ever again

1107
02:02:48,980 --> 02:02:51,949
"At least, try"

1108
02:02:52,851 --> 02:02:54,751
"Try, at least"

1109
02:02:55,788 --> 02:02:56,948
"Try, please"

1110
02:03:40,766 --> 02:03:44,758
Check out the security.
He mustn't survive this attempt

1111
02:03:51,976 --> 02:03:53,841
I'll call later

1112
02:03:56,815 --> 02:03:59,841
Kanu wants to tell you something

1113
02:04:59,778 --> 02:05:03,908
I know what state you're in.
I won't waste time asking how you are

1114
02:05:04,984 --> 02:05:11,753
In this country I'm no policeman. We've
no extradition treaty with this country

1115
02:05:12,791 --> 02:05:15,760
"I came by, just to see you"

1116
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:26,931
You take me for a fool?
- I don't talk to fools

1117
02:05:32,778 --> 02:05:37,943
What will you do now?.
You haven't much of a base left

1118
02:05:39,018 --> 02:05:45,821
"You've only so many men left in India.
Some Malik killed, some I killed"

1119
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:50,923
"Yes I know, new hands keep coming"

1120
02:05:51,797 --> 02:05:55,995
But the company isn't what it was

1121
02:06:00,005 --> 02:06:01,905
So what do you say?

1122
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:05,767
Can I get a tea or something?

1123
02:06:17,790 --> 02:06:19,758
"Kanu, you've seen
what the business is like"

1124
02:06:20,759 --> 02:06:24,024
"He can't let go, nor can I"

1125
02:06:25,030 --> 02:06:28,966
What's left of Malikbhai?
He took three bullets

1126
02:06:29,968 --> 02:06:33,904
"He's barely alive, he's in bad shape
you know Malikbhai, don't you?"

1127
02:06:34,773 --> 02:06:35,933
What can he do now?.

1128
02:06:39,011 --> 02:06:42,777
"Malikbhai, I'll tell him.
He won't do anything"

1129
02:06:42,881 --> 02:06:44,849
He'll give it all up.
Please forgive him

1130
02:06:45,017 --> 02:06:48,919
You think he will listen to you?
- He will listen to me

1131
02:06:49,021 --> 02:06:51,819
I know he will listen

1132
02:06:57,830 --> 02:07:00,993
"You'll never see us again.
We'll just go away, somewhere"

1133
02:07:01,834 --> 02:07:03,028
Please forgive him

1134
02:07:10,809 --> 02:07:12,037
"Sister, say something"

1135
02:07:22,788 --> 02:07:26,849
"I beg of you Malikbhai,
forgive him"

1136
02:07:27,759 --> 02:07:29,886
"For your little sister,
let him live"

1137
02:07:30,796 --> 02:07:32,024
Let him walk

1138
02:07:33,031 --> 02:07:34,999
For my sake

1139
02:07:38,804 --> 02:07:42,934
"Saroja, what can't be done,
can't be done"

1140
02:07:43,809 --> 02:07:44,776
Why not?

1141
02:07:46,812 --> 02:07:49,781
After all he did for you?
He even saved your life

1142
02:07:50,916 --> 02:07:52,884
Now you want his life?

1143
02:07:54,853 --> 02:07:57,981
You're a demon!
- No point explaining...

1144
02:07:59,791 --> 02:08:01,759
what you won't understand

1145
02:08:13,805 --> 02:08:15,773
"What are you doing?
- Saroja, get out of my way"

1146
02:08:15,908 --> 02:08:17,773
"Kanu, give me the gun"

1147
02:08:18,844 --> 02:08:20,744
Give me the gun

1148
02:08:21,847 --> 02:08:24,816
"Look, don't be siIly.
- I'm going to kill someone"

1149
02:08:25,851 --> 02:08:27,011
Enough of this

1150
02:08:28,921 --> 02:08:31,890
I brought you here. And you'll
kill Malik right in front of me?

1151
02:08:44,836 --> 02:08:45,894
Get the car

1152
02:09:28,780 --> 02:09:31,977
Just got news.
Your wife has died in Hong Kong

1153
02:09:35,787 --> 02:09:36,754
What?

1154
02:09:37,823 --> 02:09:38,847
Find out

1155
02:09:39,858 --> 02:09:41,951
"Ma, put Kanu on the line"

1156
02:09:46,798 --> 02:09:48,823
Didn't even tell me?

1157
02:09:50,802 --> 02:09:54,761
One bullet in the head.
The other went through the abdomen

1158
02:09:55,841 --> 02:09:59,777
"But I think,
the first shot took her life"

1159
02:10:02,781 --> 02:10:03,873
Who did it?

1160
02:10:07,986 --> 02:10:08,953
Why?

1161
02:10:10,022 --> 02:10:15,824
"Who did it or why, I don't know.
But you're the one who is responsible"

1162
02:10:20,799 --> 02:10:22,027
Just tell me one thing

1163
02:10:25,771 --> 02:10:27,739
Why did you get into this?

1164
02:10:27,939 --> 02:10:33,002
Money? It can kill you
before you've spent it

1165
02:10:33,979 --> 02:10:34,968
Power?

1166
02:10:35,847 --> 02:10:37,815
It's all a show

1167
02:10:38,050 --> 02:10:45,752
After a few small-time robberies
you met Malik. And you rose

1168
02:10:46,792 --> 02:10:48,760
And now where are you?

1169
02:10:50,028 --> 02:10:51,996
"In return, what have you?"

1170
02:10:52,831 --> 02:10:56,767
"Dead friends, a dead wife,
an estranged mother"

1171
02:10:56,935 --> 02:10:58,926
The public face of a gangster

1172
02:11:00,806 --> 02:11:07,006
Any day I prefer the bastards
who use men like you

1173
02:11:09,781 --> 02:11:16,744
"What future for you?
Wait, for the next attack"

1174
02:11:19,758 --> 02:11:21,919
"If you're lucky enough to survive,
keep running..."

1175
02:11:22,828 --> 02:11:25,763
looking for an opportunity
to get even

1176
02:11:26,031 --> 02:11:27,760
Right?

1177
02:11:30,769 --> 02:11:32,828
"In the end, you either kill
or you get killed"

1178
02:11:34,039 --> 02:11:36,803
"Even if you kill,
you still get killed"

1179
02:11:44,816 --> 02:11:50,914
If you feel there's even an iota
of truth in what I've said...

1180
02:11:51,790 --> 02:11:56,750
then come back with me

1181
02:11:58,797 --> 02:12:04,030
We can use your help to destroy
the company that the two of you buiIt

1182
02:12:07,773 --> 02:12:13,837
"Let me assure you, you will have
your vengeance a thousand times over"

1183
02:12:16,748 --> 02:12:21,947
"Chandu, don't let hatred for one man
blind you"

1184
02:12:26,024 --> 02:12:29,892
Try to understand.
Whatever is happening...

1185
02:12:30,796 --> 02:12:35,757
is in the nature of the business.
It's not because of one man

1186
02:12:52,884 --> 02:12:54,875
"I'm responsible for
whatever happened, Malik"

1187
02:12:57,989 --> 02:12:59,980
"Saroja, let bygones be.
- Listen to me"

1188
02:13:09,001 --> 02:13:10,763
That day...

1189
02:13:14,807 --> 02:13:16,774
you were sending them
after Chandu

1190
02:13:20,780 --> 02:13:22,747
I called up Kanu

1191
02:13:24,984 --> 02:13:28,920
I thought everything would
work out fine in the end

1192
02:13:34,826 --> 02:13:39,786
I never imagined Chandu
would kill Panditji

1193
02:13:43,001 --> 02:13:46,768
And everything went haywire

1194
02:13:48,841 --> 02:13:52,777
I was afraid of telling you

1195
02:13:59,818 --> 02:14:04,755
"Malik, you thought Chandu
can be killed so easily?"

1196
02:14:05,024 --> 02:14:06,786
And now...

1197
02:14:08,026 --> 02:14:12,930
I even endangered your life.
All because of me...

1198
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:16,027
it's all my fault

1199
02:14:35,820 --> 02:14:43,751
"Why did all this have to happen?
Used to be so nice. Everyone, together"

1200
02:14:44,796 --> 02:14:48,756
"You, Chandu bhai, the two sisters,
it was wonderful"

1201
02:14:49,769 --> 02:14:54,933
And now?. Chandu bhai adored you

1202
02:14:56,042 --> 02:14:57,975
I got no brains bhai

1203
02:14:58,778 --> 02:15:03,976
I can't understand why he changed.
But all the time I wonder...

1204
02:15:04,817 --> 02:15:08,877
what if everything was to become
like olden times? Somehow...

1205
02:15:10,890 --> 02:15:14,758
Chandu killed Pandit because he
thought Pandit was going to kill him?

1206
02:15:15,860 --> 02:15:19,854
How could he make such a mistake?
- Not his mistake alone

1207
02:15:21,934 --> 02:15:22,957
We all made mistakes

1208
02:15:23,803 --> 02:15:30,901
"Pawar, I want to talk to Chandu.
Get him on the phone, somehow"

1209
02:15:31,777 --> 02:15:35,974
"Malikbhai, I was about to call you.
They've taken Chandu away to India"

1210
02:16:36,809 --> 02:16:39,869
News of undetworld don Chandu's
return to India...

1211
02:16:39,978 --> 02:16:43,972
"has shaken politics, government,
business, all walks of life"

1212
02:16:44,849 --> 02:16:46,977
Turning him into a witness
for the prosecution...

1213
02:16:47,787 --> 02:16:49,948
is being regarded as one of the
greatest successes for the police

1214
02:16:50,790 --> 02:16:55,750
"According to police sources,
his depositions will unravel..."

1215
02:16:55,928 --> 02:17:00,888
the links of big names
to the undetworld

1216
02:17:01,033 --> 02:17:04,992
Rumours have been rife all day.
Names in every walk of life...

1217
02:17:05,838 --> 02:17:08,807
"police, administrators, customs,
businessmen, actors, thespians..."

1218
02:17:08,941 --> 02:17:10,909
are being mentioned

1219
02:17:11,010 --> 02:17:13,774
Heads on which his deposotions
dangle like Damocles' sword...

1220
02:17:13,913 --> 02:17:17,974
only Chandrakant can say.
Or maybe those secret patrons...

1221
02:17:18,818 --> 02:17:21,981
who have had dalliances
with the undetworld

1222
02:17:38,003 --> 02:17:39,766
Malik speaking

1223
02:17:41,807 --> 02:17:43,775
Listen to me carefully

1224
02:17:44,844 --> 02:17:49,838
Whatever happened between Chandu and me
was a grave misunderstanding

1225
02:17:53,819 --> 02:17:55,878
Breakfast is ready.
- I'm coming

1226
02:17:56,021 --> 02:17:56,988
Hurry up

1227
02:18:26,852 --> 02:18:27,910
Welcome

1228
02:18:28,788 --> 02:18:29,846
Sit

1229
02:18:31,791 --> 02:18:33,782
What would you like?
Tea? Coffee?

1230
02:18:34,994 --> 02:18:35,961
Nothing?

1231
02:18:36,796 --> 02:18:37,763
Sit

1232
02:18:38,798 --> 02:18:40,959
Chandu talks a lot about you

1233
02:18:43,769 --> 02:18:48,001
Is he all right?
- Perfectly. He's doing lots for us

1234
02:18:50,009 --> 02:18:53,740
"I want to see him, once"

1235
02:19:00,753 --> 02:19:01,777
Yes Mr Raote?

1236
02:19:02,788 --> 02:19:06,884
What to do about Chandu?
- What do you mean?

1237
02:19:07,793 --> 02:19:11,923
"What if he squeals on me?
- If he squeals, he squeals"

1238
02:19:12,898 --> 02:19:19,895
"What are you saying?
- Mr Raote, we've patched up"

1239
02:21:22,795 --> 02:21:23,853
Malik called

1240
02:21:28,033 --> 02:21:30,763
You wish to see Chandrakant?

1241
02:21:33,005 --> 02:21:35,940
"No sir, what problems can I have?"

1242
02:21:37,776 --> 02:21:40,802
"Yes, I'll pick you up"

1243
02:22:20,019 --> 02:22:20,986
Lady...

1244
02:22:43,742 --> 02:22:46,802
I'm glad to hear
about your cooperation

1245
02:22:47,780 --> 02:22:51,011
Mr Sreenivasan says you are
in possession of lots of evidence?

1246
02:22:55,020 --> 02:22:59,855
Don't be afraid. The government
will take good care of you

1247
02:23:00,959 --> 02:23:02,927
We will also take care of your mother

1248
02:23:04,897 --> 02:23:06,865
You take care of me

1249
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:11,993
I'm happy because people
like you who cooperate...

1250
02:23:12,838 --> 02:23:16,797
are examples for other criminals.
You understand?

1251
02:23:28,987 --> 02:23:30,852
What have you done?

1252
02:23:39,799 --> 02:23:44,758
I couldn't show you the evidence
against him...

1253
02:23:47,005 --> 02:23:49,769
and I don't need evidence
to satisfy myself

1254
02:23:52,044 --> 02:23:57,812
You can say it was part of the job
you brought me over to do

1255
02:24:04,790 --> 02:24:08,817
"After the incident, Chandrakant was
shifted to a maximum security cell"

1256
02:24:08,961 --> 02:24:12,920
"On one hand, there are condemning
a failure of the system..."

1257
02:24:13,799 --> 02:24:16,768
"on the other hand,
Raote's political opposition..."

1258
02:24:16,902 --> 02:24:20,861
is alleging undetworld connections.
Whatever the truth...

1259
02:24:21,006 --> 02:24:24,874
in the accusations
and counter accusations...

1260
02:24:24,978 --> 02:24:27,946
the heat of the debate or
demands forjudicial enquiries...

1261
02:24:28,780 --> 02:24:31,749
the incident hangs like a question mark
over the entire system

1262
02:24:33,051 --> 02:24:39,753
I could never have proved that
Raote had a hand in PatiI's murder

1263
02:24:46,031 --> 02:24:50,935
But this much I understand.
In the state you're in...

1264
02:24:51,770 --> 02:24:57,003
you have no need to lie. For all
the information you've given me...

1265
02:24:57,911 --> 02:25:01,937
maybe even you don't know
how many heads will roll...

1266
02:25:02,782 --> 02:25:07,742
and what a difference this is going
to make to the crime situation

1267
02:25:09,923 --> 02:25:11,890
In return...

1268
02:25:13,792 --> 02:25:19,753
I can offer you nothing more
than thanks and gratitude

1269
02:25:35,981 --> 02:25:37,812
Mr Sreenivasan...

1270
02:25:41,820 --> 02:25:44,755
can I talk to Malik once?

1271
02:25:49,928 --> 02:25:50,952
Sreenivasan

1272
02:25:53,032 --> 02:25:55,830
Your friend wants to talk to you

1273
02:26:08,781 --> 02:26:11,908
Malikbhai...
- Chandu...

1274
02:26:19,791 --> 02:26:24,752
About Kanu. I made a grave mistake

1275
02:26:27,800 --> 02:26:29,767
We all made mistakes

1276
02:26:33,806 --> 02:26:41,872
"Malikbhai, I'm about to do
what I think is right"

1277
02:26:46,052 --> 02:26:48,816
If you suffer any losses...

1278
02:26:51,757 --> 02:26:53,749
don't take it personally

1279
02:26:56,029 --> 02:26:57,791
I understand

1280
02:27:10,776 --> 02:27:14,975
You know I was telling my wife
last night...

1281
02:27:15,815 --> 02:27:18,978
if the two of them give up crime...

1282
02:27:19,818 --> 02:27:22,014
no knowing how far they might go

1283
02:27:25,024 --> 02:27:26,991
I'm not Chandu

1284
02:27:28,928 --> 02:27:34,889
"I know, you aren't.
But think about what I said"

1285
02:27:36,803 --> 02:27:40,762
If you come over...
- Were I to give you the same offer?

1286
02:27:44,777 --> 02:27:46,745
Nor am I Chandu

1287
02:27:50,882 --> 02:27:53,943
Take care of Chandu.
- Sure

1288
02:28:04,864 --> 02:28:09,858
"Last night, Andheri and Byculla
were raided. 25 raids in all"

1289
02:28:10,870 --> 02:28:12,861
"30 of our boys, arrested"

1290
02:28:14,807 --> 02:28:18,971
"Malik, I hope Chandu isn't
causing you much damage"

1291
02:28:19,812 --> 02:28:23,975
So what? It's our Chandu.
Got to hand it out to the guy

1292
02:28:25,017 --> 02:28:28,817
And the way he killed Raote!
While the whole world watched

1293
02:28:29,789 --> 02:28:31,757
Brought fame to the company

1294
02:29:38,991 --> 02:29:44,759
Just received message from Hong Kong.
Someone killed Malik

1295
02:29:48,768 --> 02:29:52,795
Hong Kong police has arrested
one Kawra Singh on suspicion

1296
02:30:17,997 --> 02:30:20,966
Chandu spent the rest of his life
behind bars

1297
02:30:22,768 --> 02:30:29,003
"He was allowed to go out only once,
for his mother's funeral"

1298
02:30:30,843 --> 02:30:33,004
Rani died of heart attack

1299
02:30:34,981 --> 02:30:37,814
The police couldn't naiI Pappu
for killing Krishnan

1300
02:30:39,785 --> 02:30:45,746
Now he is into real estate.
He visits Chandu every Sunday

1301
02:30:47,793 --> 02:30:51,889
"After Malik died, Yadav tried
to run the company"

1302
02:30:53,032 --> 02:30:56,900
But he didn't have the capability
of controlling the other gangs

1303
02:30:58,804 --> 02:31:01,830
Now he runs a small gang
out of Bangkok...

1304
02:31:02,041 --> 02:31:04,771
one of the many Mumbai gangs

1305
02:31:06,779 --> 02:31:08,747
Saroja still lives in Hong Kong...

1306
02:31:09,782 --> 02:31:14,913
"with Joseph, his mother,
his sister and her husband"

1307
02:31:16,789 --> 02:31:21,817
She runs a boutique of Indian dresses.
It's doing fairly well

1308
02:31:23,796 --> 02:31:30,725
Joseph drives Saroja's car and
at Indian hotels in Hong Kong...

1309
02:31:30,937 --> 02:31:34,964
"after a few drinks, he reels off spiel
about the olden days"

1310
02:31:37,009 --> 02:31:38,977
After a few years...

1311
02:31:39,779 --> 02:31:42,748
Sreenivasan became the chief
of a police training school

1312
02:31:43,783 --> 02:31:47,742
Currently he is penning a novel about
his encounters with the undetworld

1313
02:31:48,821 --> 02:31:51,949
"Hearsay has it that
he has named the book "Company"
