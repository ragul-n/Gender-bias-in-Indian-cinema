Oh my god, guys start wrapping up

00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:02,499
Two minutes left

00:01:02,576 --> 00:01:04,168
Come on, tie your papers, Sonia

4
00:01:04,244 --> 00:01:05,643
Time to wrap up, come on

5
00:01:06,179 --> 00:01:07,373
You have to start tying up your papers

6
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:09,312
Stop writing, hey you!

7
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,346

Good luck with your results.

Make sure you all give
me your supplements.

00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:14,644
Thank you Miss Naaz,
it's been a great year.

Thank you, Luv.

Will think of you a lot.

19
00:02:17,517 --> 00:02:18,575
Take care.

00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:31,321

Freak out

24
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:39,329
School's out

25
00:02:41,608 --> 00:02:43,667
l love the holidays

26
00:02:43,743 --> 00:02:45,938
They are super cool

27
00:02:46,947 --> 00:02:48,938
lt's time to fly

28
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:51,279
So what's the point of walking?

29
00:02:51,818 --> 00:02:54,286
Been grounded forever

30
00:02:54,354 --> 00:02:56,948
Freedom, here we come!!

31
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,282
Let's club hop and party hop

32
00:03:02,496 --> 00:03:03,554
Freak out

33
00:03:04,965 --> 00:03:06,023
School's out

34
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:08,692
Freak out

35
00:03:10,303 --> 00:03:11,361
School's out

36
00:03:13,306 --> 00:03:15,831
Let's hang out in pubs and clubs

37
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:18,309
Where the music is super loud

38
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:21,310
And we can gossip all night

39
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:23,315
Oooh yeah!

40
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:39,329
Afternoons will leisurely
pass playing video games

41
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,324
Spend the evening shopping

42
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:44,393
On daddy's tab

Late night movie @ 11 pm

00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:56,008
Hey yo!

47
00:04:07,027 --> 00:04:11,361
Why is my heart so lonely?

48
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:16,558
Under the guise of flirting,
we can start dating

49
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,838
ln the back seat of the car

50
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:22,704
Two are better than one

51
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:27,907
ls there anyone
who will go all the way?

52
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:31,449
Owowowow!

53
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:34,384
Freak out

54
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:36,780
School's out

55
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:39,449
Freak out

56
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,986
School's out

57
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:44,855
Freak out

58
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,457
School's out

59
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:50,127
Freak out

60
00:04:51,738 --> 00:04:52,796
School's out

61
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:55,465
Freak out

62
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:02,406
Yes, this is also right!

63
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:03,540
What answer did you write

64
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:04,675
for the catalyst of sodium hydrate?

65
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:06,412
Exams are done.

66
00:05:06,486 --> 00:05:07,953
You always wake up late, tubelight!

67
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:09,079
But the answer was option C, right?

68
00:05:09,155 --> 00:05:10,417
What did you write?

69
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,617
Me too! l wrote C...
C is my lucky letter for the year.

70
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:14,091
So you wrote C for all the answers?

71
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,424
Yeah! That's what l did! All Cs.

72
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,422
Are you serious?

73
00:05:18,498 --> 00:05:19,556
Yes!

74
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:20,691
Very good, Sonia.

75
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,099
l'm convinced you will become
a top model. Ask me why?

76
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:24,431
Why?

77
00:05:24,504 --> 00:05:25,698
You're empty in
the top floor of your head.

78
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:27,097
Shut up, Jugs!

79
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:29,641
At least l can wear a sexy
dress for tonight's party.

80
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:30,767
What about you?

81
00:05:30,844 --> 00:05:32,106
You eat so much all day

82
00:05:32,178 --> 00:05:33,975
that you don't fit into your
pants by the end of the day.

83
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:38,108
Elastic bands, baby. l'm fat,
but l'm still so happy

84
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:39,446
Look at you... skinny!

85
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,453
You're a sub-size zero...
and you're still unhappy.

86
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:42,579
lt's a miracle

87
00:05:42,656 --> 00:05:43,850
Don't be mean, Jugs.

88
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:45,584
She's just careful
about what she eats.

89
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:46,921
What does she eat?

90
00:05:47,193 --> 00:05:49,718
Eat something once in a while,
Sonia... seriously.

91
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:51,593
We have to turn off the
fans because of you...

92
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:52,723
what if you fly away?

93
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:53,857
l won't fly away...

94
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:55,457
you are such a huge
paperweight on this planet.

95
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:56,797
Hey, keep away from my weight.

96
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,134
Chill ya, why do you guys
keep fighting all the time?

97
00:05:59,205 --> 00:06:00,467
Come on

98
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,007
So? Do we make out or what?

99
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:05,475
C'mon, we've been friends

100
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:07,069
for over ten years now...
this is cool.

101
00:06:07,147 --> 00:06:08,478
And plus, it's fun.

102
00:06:08,548 --> 00:06:09,606
Here, now eat some.

103
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:11,478
You wanna know what's really fun?

104
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:12,609
What?

105
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:13,880
The exams are over!

106
00:06:13,953 --> 00:06:15,147
EEEEEYAAAHOOO

107
00:06:15,221 --> 00:06:17,746
And tonight, we're gonna
see Freddie Kapoor Live...

108
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:19,485
ln front of our own eyes...

109
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,817
He's so cute!

110
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:21,952
l know.

111
00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:23,495
Have you decided what
you're going to wear?

112
00:06:23,563 --> 00:06:24,621
lt's your birthday tonight, right?

113
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:26,165
Wear your birthday suit...

114
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:29,499
Luv Nanda will like that a lot.

115
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:31,764
Enough! You've started
with your Luv Nanda again.

116
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:32,896
l'm telling you

117
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:34,030
Babe, he's bad news.

118
00:06:34,107 --> 00:06:35,768
And l'm telling you,
he's my boyfriend.

119
00:06:36,776 --> 00:06:38,038
He's the son of a smuggler.

120
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:40,636
Jugs, his dad's a businessman.

121
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:42,181
Veerappan was also a businessman.

122
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:44,580
Jugs, we had decided
that we wouldn't interfere.

123
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:45,709
Chuck it.

124
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:46,843
C'mon, ya.

125
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,512
Karthikeyan Ramachandran,

126
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:49,646
What the hell are you doing?

127
00:06:49,723 --> 00:06:51,122
You're stalking me again? What is it?

128
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:53,049
WHAT lS lT?

129
00:06:53,526 --> 00:06:54,584
Will you talk?

130
00:06:58,064 --> 00:06:59,122
TELL ME.

131
00:07:01,534 --> 00:07:02,592
Oh!

132
00:07:02,936 --> 00:07:03,994
Get out.

133
00:07:04,537 --> 00:07:06,198
What a freak dude?

134
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:07,534
Seriously man.

135
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:08,665
Stalker.

136
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:09,800
He's your neighbour, right?

137
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:10,934
Keep him in check

138
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,534
Else he'll get beaten again.

139
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:15,547
l guess he's comes here for just that.

140
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:17,614
l think you turn him on.

141
00:07:17,684 --> 00:07:18,742
Ewwww! Gross.

142
00:07:18,818 --> 00:07:20,547
Sonia, stop laughing.

143
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:23,755
You guys can't even
turn on a light bulb.

144
00:07:23,823 --> 00:07:27,554
And the three of you together
can't even fit it in a socket.

145
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:29,822
Aww, you felt bad.

146
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:31,822
So sorry.

147
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:36,692
Hey Rhea, heard you're
doing the Mentos ad.

148
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:41,028
l hope they're using
you just for radio.

149
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:43,575
lf you appear on the TV,
it will crash, right?

150
00:07:43,643 --> 00:07:46,578
And l've heard you're doing
an ad for some pest control.

151
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:47,908
Perfect choice.

152
00:07:47,981 --> 00:07:49,039
Looking at you,

153
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:50,582
you know, rats,
mosquitoes and cockroaches

154
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,584
will commit suicide.

155
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:53,710
Whatever.

156
00:07:53,787 --> 00:07:56,119
Hey Jugs, just let it be.

157
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:58,580
Did you see that? She's smart.

158
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:01,727
Even though she's
wearing a bracelet from 1942.

159
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:04,730
That's so old fashioned...

160
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:06,925
At least, she's not
like you... slutty.

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,592
And so says the fatty.

162
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:10,260
Jugs, let it be.

163
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:12,600
lt's our last day of Junior College.

164
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:14,003
Let's go.

165
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:16,268
See, always the losers.

166
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:17,871
Ta ta, losers!

167
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:21,812
Hey, do come to Gollu's party.

168
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:24,611
He needs someone to cook.

169
00:08:24,684 --> 00:08:26,208
l'll show you the way to the kitchen.

170
00:08:28,288 --> 00:08:31,951
And l'll show you the
way to your graves... *****

171
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:33,083
Come on.

172
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,217
Let it go...

173
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:40,090
Ladies, ladies, ladies...

174
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,633
don't finish all the
hot stepping here.

175
00:08:41,701 --> 00:08:43,635
Save some for my party tonight.

176
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:48,834
Hey Gollu, we were walking
away from your party. Got it?

177
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:50,967
l love the way you tease me.

178
00:08:51,177 --> 00:08:54,169
But remember, Freddie Kapoor
is playing at my party tonight.

179
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:57,307
And only short skirts and mini
dresses allowed in my party.

180
00:08:57,383 --> 00:09:00,250
lf l don't see girls high,
then bye bye!

181
00:09:00,987 --> 00:09:02,852
Hey, what's girls high?

182
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:04,180
Why do you need to know that?

183
00:09:04,257 --> 00:09:07,658
Anyway, you're never
gonna get there. Forget it.

184
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:08,853
Wassup guys?

185
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:12,125
Hey Luv, how are you doing?

186
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:13,256
Great.

187
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,800
All set for the party tonight?

188
00:09:14,868 --> 00:09:15,926
Dude, l'm like super-set.

189
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:17,060
You were getting your new car, right?

190
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:18,194
Where is it?

191
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:19,329
ln the parking lot... right outside.

192
00:09:19,405 --> 00:09:20,667
Oh great, let's go for a ride.

193
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,798
No, no, no.

194
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,206
The first ride is for Rhea.

195
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:25,210
C'mon man, you and your Rhea.

196
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:27,813
Hey, you guys know
everything is for her.

197
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:29,072
What dude...

198
00:09:29,148 --> 00:09:30,206
So l'll see you guys at 10pm?

199
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:31,341
Yeah man

200
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:32,679
Alright dude.

201
00:09:32,752 --> 00:09:33,810
So you guys are coming home, right?

202
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:35,354
Let's get ready there
and head to the party.

203
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:37,150
What ready? l'm coming like this.

204
00:09:37,357 --> 00:09:38,415
You have a make-up kit, right?

205
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:39,953
Or l'll get my mom's kit.

206
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:41,084
Hiiiiieeee.

207
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:44,093
Hi girls.

208
00:09:44,697 --> 00:09:45,755
Yoohoo.

209
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:46,890
This is our last chance to escape.

210
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:48,024
Let's run.

211
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:49,159
Don't be mean, Jugs.

212
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:50,702
She's Sonia's mom.

213
00:09:51,037 --> 00:09:52,095
Sorry, Son.

214
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,165
Hey, don't be.

215
00:09:54,374 --> 00:09:55,432
l already am.

216
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,699
Wassup girlfriends?

217
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:00,110
Congratulations.

218
00:10:01,915 --> 00:10:03,712
Now you're no more girls.

219
00:10:03,783 --> 00:10:05,774
You've become women.

220
00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:08,179
Welcome to the club.

221
00:10:08,254 --> 00:10:09,721
l'm so excited.

222
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:12,257
Mom, what are you doing here?

223
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:15,852
Hey, l've come here to boost my BlFFs.

224
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:16,987
BlFF?

225
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:18,730
Best Friends Forever.

226
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:19,992
Sonia, you're so not with it.

227
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:21,192
We'll have to do something about her.

228
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:23,998
Mom, it's B-F-F.

229
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:25,861
Where did you get the 'l' from?

230
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:28,269
l am your Best
Friend Forever, darling.

231
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:29,933
So, there's the 'l'
- Right? Right?

232
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:31,738
Let's go.

233
00:10:31,811 --> 00:10:32,869
Hey, where?

234
00:10:32,946 --> 00:10:34,345
We've met them after such a long time.

235
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:35,813
That too on your Graduation Day.

236
00:10:35,882 --> 00:10:39,079
Jugs, you haven't tried that
General Motors Diet right?

237
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:40,210
l can make out.

238
00:10:40,286 --> 00:10:41,344
Look at me.

239
00:10:41,421 --> 00:10:42,479
ln just 15 days.

240
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:45,081
5 kilos.

241
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:46,284
All in the right places.

242
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:48,759
Hey, where's the party tonight?

243
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:50,159
Where are the cute boys tonight?

244
00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:51,287
Mom?

245
00:10:51,364 --> 00:10:52,422
Aunty, there are no cute boys.

246
00:10:52,498 --> 00:10:54,159
We're going together.

247
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:55,291
Ouch!

248
00:10:55,368 --> 00:10:56,892
And our curfew is from 11 o'clock.

249
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,962
This curfew stuff is such nonsense.

250
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,097
Mom, mom, mom, let's go.

251
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:02,971
Hey, where to? Take a chill pill.

252
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:04,976
Hey, enjoy yourself.

253
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:06,306
Have a blast.

254
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:07,778
Have a blast.

255
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:10,315
l wish l were there with you.

256
00:11:10,383 --> 00:11:11,441
Bye.

257
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:13,843
Mom.

258
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,785
What mom, mom?

259
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:17,914
How many times have l told you,
call me Lux.

260
00:11:18,124 --> 00:11:20,058
Now you too get your portfolio done.

261
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:22,924
These plain types like
Rhea are getting Mentos ads.

262
00:11:22,996 --> 00:11:25,191
And you have my looks, so pretty.

263
00:11:29,802 --> 00:11:32,794
Here comes your Satan Bhagat.

264
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:33,930
Hey, Rhea.

265
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:35,065
Hi, Luv.

266
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:36,199
Hey, Jugs.

267
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:37,333
C'mon baby, hop in.

268
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:38,868
Rhea...

269
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:42,345
your virginity is everything.

270
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:43,814
Please don't lose it.

271
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,277
Especially not in
the back seat of a car.

272
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:49,218
Okay 'mom', bye.

273
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:01,492
Karthikeyan Ramachandran,
l can see you.

274
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:02,898
You wait now.

275
00:12:05,838 --> 00:12:08,033
F-U-N Fun Funaa.

276
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:09,165
Come on.

277
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:12,507
lf you can, Gun Guna.

278
00:12:12,578 --> 00:12:13,840
Dude, l can't believe it.

279
00:12:13,913 --> 00:12:15,380
We're gonna be
watching Freddie Kapoor Live.

280
00:12:15,448 --> 00:12:16,506
l'm so excited.

281
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:19,244
Well l bet you're not as excited
as sitting in my cool new Jag.

282
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:21,047
Uh, no l'm not.

283
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:23,514
Jag? Freddie Kapoor?

284
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:25,250
You can't even compare the two.

285
00:12:25,324 --> 00:12:26,518
You're mistaken, baby.

286
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:27,854
Do you know how many cars like
these are there in the world?

287
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:28,985
How many?

288
00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:30,393
Just 33. That's it.

289
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,261
Baby, she loves you.

290
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:33,523
Do you know...

291
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:36,124
Sometimes it feels like you
love your car more than me.

292
00:12:36,202 --> 00:12:37,464
Aww, come on baby.

293
00:12:37,537 --> 00:12:39,402
You know that's not true.

294
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:40,871
You know l love you more.

295
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,464
Especially when the
car's in the garage.

296
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:44,267
What an ass.

297
00:12:44,343 --> 00:12:45,867
C'mon babes, chill.

298
00:12:46,412 --> 00:12:49,472
Babes, hey, look, l'm kidding,
l'm kidding.

299
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:50,607
Come here.

300
00:12:52,218 --> 00:12:54,550
See l got this car because
it's your 18th birthday.

301
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,417
And l wanted it to be special.

302
00:12:57,356 --> 00:12:58,948
But why did you have to do so much?

303
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:00,549
l mean, you didn't
have to get your car.

304
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:03,424
You and l watching Freddie
Kapoor would have been great.

305
00:13:03,896 --> 00:13:05,557
Well, if that's enough,

306
00:13:05,898 --> 00:13:07,889
l'll cancel our
reservation at the Thai Jungle.

307
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:11,901
You booked us in at the Thai Jungle?

308
00:13:12,038 --> 00:13:13,903
But it's so expensive.

309
00:13:13,973 --> 00:13:16,908
Baby, tonight, there's
nothing too expensive for you.

310
00:13:17,176 --> 00:13:19,167
Oh, Luv

311
00:13:19,245 --> 00:13:20,303
l love you baby.

312
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:21,437
l love you.

313
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:23,175
Whoa! Babes, not the hair.

314
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:24,307
Not the hair please.

315
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:25,509
Not the hair please... relax.

316
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:27,381
Are you a diva?

317
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:29,384
Well, what can l say?

318
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:31,389
Whoa babes, watch out...

319
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:32,924
Watch out

320
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:34,926
Stop stop stop

321
00:13:39,332 --> 00:13:40,390
And we're home.

322
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:44,269
So, pick me up tonight.

323
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,069
l'll see you later, baby.

324
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:47,197
Bye.

325
00:13:47,273 --> 00:13:49,070
Umm, babes, you remember?

326
00:13:49,675 --> 00:13:53,941
Tonight? Our big celebration?

327
00:13:54,614 --> 00:13:56,605
Dinner? After the party?

328
00:13:56,682 --> 00:13:58,081
lt's just you and me.

329
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:05,614
Actually Luv,
l'm a little nervous about that.

330
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:06,953
Nervous?

331
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,222
Babes, why are you nervous?

332
00:14:10,296 --> 00:14:12,423
Babes, you aren't
with some random guy.

333
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:13,556
You're with me.

334
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:14,691
Your Luv.

335
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:16,025
Trust me.

336
00:14:16,702 --> 00:14:18,226
Tonight, when we're together,

337
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:21,038
you won't feel like this.

338
00:14:21,107 --> 00:14:23,632
lt'll be the most
natural feeling in the world.

339
00:14:27,513 --> 00:14:31,643
Remember, you said that
you wouldn't pressurise me?

340
00:14:33,452 --> 00:14:35,113
l'm not pressurising you, baby.

341
00:14:35,588 --> 00:14:39,991
lt's just that l've always
wanted this night to be special.

342
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:43,995
And now that you are in my life,
l just can't wait.

343
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:50,000
But you know what?

344
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:52,002
lf you don't want to

345
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:54,005
We don't have to.

346
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,398
C'mon now.

347
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:15,752
l'm ready.

348
00:15:17,563 --> 00:15:18,621
Babes, there's no pressure.

349
00:15:18,698 --> 00:15:19,756
Not at all?

350
00:15:20,032 --> 00:15:21,090
No, no, no.

351
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:23,294
Seriously, l'm ready.

352
00:15:24,237 --> 00:15:27,035
And l've never been so sure
about anything in my life.

353
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:28,164
Okay.

354
00:15:29,175 --> 00:15:30,369
Don't be late, okay?

355
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:33,708
Pick me up at 9 o'clock, sharp.

356
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:35,714
l will, l will, l promise.

357
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:37,043
Don't be late.

358
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:38,174
Okay.

359
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:39,309
Hey! Hey!

360
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:43,177
And here's something l made for you.

361
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:45,053
Happy Anniversary, baby.

362
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:46,182
Anniversary?

363
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:48,454
Yeah! We've
completed 4 months, stupid.

364
00:15:48,527 --> 00:15:50,324
Oh My God. Yes, yes, today.

365
00:15:50,396 --> 00:15:52,728
l'm so sorry, l forgot.

366
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:54,595
lt's our 4-month anniversary, man.

367
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:55,725
l know, l know, l just remembered.

368
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:57,063

C'mon c'mon, let's take

Alright.

Why am l singing to myself?

00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:27,630
Why am l smiling to myself?

375
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:33,367
What's going to happen tonight?

376
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:38,107
Although l'm on top of the world

377
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:41,442
l'm also a little afraid about

378
00:16:42,114 --> 00:16:47,108

About my first love

381
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:58,721

Oh mom, wassup?

00:19:09,795 --> 00:19:10,853
How was your exam?

410
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,525
Nothing out of the syllabus, right?

411
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:15,464
lt was okay mom, l'll pass.

412
00:19:15,534 --> 00:19:17,798
Pass? You always get great marks.

413
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,270
And l'm sure you'll get
great marks this year too.

414
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:21,931
Of course, dad, l will.

415
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:23,736
Where are you headed
off with these bags?

416
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:25,538
Sandeep Uncle is in hospital.

417
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:26,805
He's got chest pains.

418
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:28,278
We'll have to go to Pune.

419
00:19:28,614 --> 00:19:30,275
Okay, take care.

420
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:31,407
And be good. And bye.

421
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:33,818
You're leaving now?
- Yep.

422
00:19:33,886 --> 00:19:36,354
That means you won't be
here on my birthday eve?

423
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:37,616
Oh, come on, Rhea.

424
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,282
lt's just a matter of one night.

425
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:40,552
We'll be back tomorrow morning.

426
00:19:40,626 --> 00:19:43,618
Listen, you must take care of
your Granny and Minty, alright?

427
00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:46,358
And no late night
movies for Minty, okay?

428
00:19:46,432 --> 00:19:47,490
You make sure of that.

429
00:19:49,502 --> 00:19:51,629
But, but, mom.

430
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:53,638
How can l stay home tonight?

431
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:55,637
Oh God, no, not tonight, please mom.

432
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,972
l told you, it's a big night for me.

433
00:19:58,043 --> 00:19:59,772
lt's Freddie Kapoor's concert tonight.

434
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:02,303
Rhea, l'm so sorry.

435
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:04,315
But it's just a matter of one night.

436
00:20:04,383 --> 00:20:05,441
Try and understand.

437
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:09,318
Caw! Caw! He's trying
to sit on my head again.

438
00:20:09,588 --> 00:20:10,646
Son of a *****

439
00:20:10,723 --> 00:20:12,987
Mom, please, language.

440
00:20:13,058 --> 00:20:16,323
And stop focusing on
the crows, please.

441
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:18,386
Hey, it's not a crow,
it's your father-in-law.

442
00:20:18,464 --> 00:20:19,522
Huh?

443
00:20:19,598 --> 00:20:21,998
He didn't have the guts to
fight with me while he was alive.

444
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:23,932
Now, he's taking revenge after dying.

445
00:20:24,003 --> 00:20:25,334
l'm coming!

446
00:20:25,404 --> 00:20:28,669
Mom, you're leaving me
with this crazy granny?

447
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:30,333
l have a party tonight.

448
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:31,535
Why don't you do one thing?

449
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:33,401
lf you can't have a girls night out

450
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:34,673
Why don't you have a girls' night in?

451
00:20:34,747 --> 00:20:35,873
Why don't you have a pajama party?

452
00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:37,006
lt'll be really cool.

453
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:38,879
Mom, can't you stay back?

454
00:20:40,352 --> 00:20:45,016
Mom, Rhea can bring her
friends home, why can't l?

455
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,820
Minty, it's Rhea's birthday, right?

456
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:50,361
But mom, it's her birthday tomorrow.

457
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:53,489
Minty, shall l check your homework?

458
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:57,901
Oh damn, who has kept
buckets here in the kitchen?

459
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,369
ls this any way to...

460
00:20:59,438 --> 00:21:01,702
Mom, that's the bathroom.

461
00:21:01,774 --> 00:21:03,708
The kitchen is on this side.

462
00:21:05,377 --> 00:21:07,368
l am so sorry,

463
00:21:07,446 --> 00:21:10,040
but l promise l'll make
this up to you tomorrow.

464
00:21:10,115 --> 00:21:11,377
Alright? Okay.

465
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:15,853
Okay, chin up, l'll see you
in the morning tomorrow.

466
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:18,389
You girls, see you, bye.

467
00:21:18,457 --> 00:21:19,515
Be good, alright?

468
00:21:19,725 --> 00:21:22,717
And Minty, don't trouble
your sister Rhea.

469
00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:24,057
Okay mom, bye.

470
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:25,721
Bye Luv, bye.

471
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:27,390
Hey, give me a smile.

472
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:42,411
l'm really sorry Luv,

473
00:21:42,481 --> 00:21:45,416
but Mom and Dad have
screwed up tonight's plan.

474
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:50,955
Ugh! Why are you kissing
the computer?

475
00:21:51,624 --> 00:21:53,489
Oh my God, Rhea.

476
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:56,427
lf dad comes to know,
he'll have a heart attack.

477
00:21:56,562 --> 00:21:58,427
That you are going
around with this smuggler,

478
00:21:58,497 --> 00:21:59,555
Mukesh Nanda's son?

479
00:21:59,632 --> 00:22:00,894
He's not a gangster,
he's a politician.

480
00:22:00,966 --> 00:22:03,434
And anyway Minty,
we're just friends, okay?

481
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:07,830
A guy and a girl can never
be just friends, sis.

482
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:10,973
Fine Minty, what do you want?

483
00:22:11,043 --> 00:22:12,772
Your Diesel jeans.

484
00:22:12,845 --> 00:22:14,710
Those? Those are my favourite.

485
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,042
And they won't even fit you.

486
00:22:16,448 --> 00:22:18,973
Sis, this is a future investment.

487
00:22:19,118 --> 00:22:21,518
Your generation will
never understand it.

488
00:22:21,587 --> 00:22:22,781
No way, Minty.

489
00:22:23,122 --> 00:22:26,922
No problem,
can you tell me dad's number?

490
00:22:30,195 --> 00:22:31,457
Here, take this.

491
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,464
Do you know you're no less
than a gangster!

492
00:22:33,532 --> 00:22:35,466
Sis, how about that top?

493
00:22:35,534 --> 00:22:36,592
Shut up, and get outta here.

494
00:22:49,014 --> 00:22:51,141
Hey, missing me already?

495
00:22:51,216 --> 00:22:52,877
Luv, something's gone wrong.

496
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:54,009
What happened?

497
00:22:54,086 --> 00:22:56,145
My parents had to rush to Pune.

498
00:22:56,221 --> 00:22:59,019
And l will have to stay at home
to babysit Granny and Minty.

499
00:22:59,091 --> 00:23:00,490
l can't make it tonight.

500
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:02,684
C'mon babes, you can come for a while.

501
00:23:02,761 --> 00:23:04,490
l'll pick you up and drop
you home on time, l promise.

502
00:23:04,563 --> 00:23:06,497
l'm sorry, not tonight.

503
00:23:06,565 --> 00:23:07,759
Babes, what do you mean not tonight?

504
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:09,164
l've made all the
arrangements for tonight.

505
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:11,168
Dinner, party, Freddie Kapoor.

506
00:23:11,236 --> 00:23:13,500
Babes, l mean you and me,
what about all that?

507
00:23:13,572 --> 00:23:16,166
Tomorrow, l'm all yours,
l just can't come tonight.

508
00:23:16,241 --> 00:23:17,503
l'm really sorry.

509
00:23:19,978 --> 00:23:21,172
Don't be sorry, baby.

510
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:23,510
Anyway, l don't wanna go to the party.

511
00:23:23,716 --> 00:23:26,514
So, now that you're not going,
l'll chill at home.

512
00:23:26,585 --> 00:23:29,520
Luv, l'll feel worse if you don't go.

513
00:23:29,588 --> 00:23:30,646
Please.

514
00:23:30,723 --> 00:23:33,055
Fine, l'll go. But l'm telling you

515
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:36,525
l'll go, sit in a corner and
just keep remembering you.

516
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:39,530
Anyway, we're gonna be
together tomorrow, right?

517
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:41,532
So cheer up.

518
00:23:43,202 --> 00:23:44,260
l love you.

519
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,128
Bye.

520
00:23:54,213 --> 00:23:57,808
Guys, l must be the only one
sitting at home on my 18th birthday.

521
00:23:57,883 --> 00:23:58,941
So don't sit at home.

522
00:23:59,017 --> 00:24:00,075
Who asked you to?

523
00:24:00,152 --> 00:24:01,210
Tell me something.

524
00:24:01,286 --> 00:24:02,548
l have a plan.

525
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:06,080
Let's party at home till late.

526
00:24:06,158 --> 00:24:07,750
And when your Granny crashes,

527
00:24:07,826 --> 00:24:08,952
we'll go out and party.

528
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:11,620
Yuppie, Freddie Kapoor.

529
00:24:12,097 --> 00:24:13,155
There's one problem.

530
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:14,957
My Granny doesn't sleep.

531
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:16,091
What?

532
00:24:16,168 --> 00:24:17,567
She's an insomniac... can't sleep.

533
00:24:17,636 --> 00:24:18,694
At night too?

534
00:24:20,973 --> 00:24:22,031
l have an idea.

535
00:24:22,107 --> 00:24:23,574
To party at home,

536
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:26,110
we'll need to get some
rum and tequila, right?

537
00:24:26,178 --> 00:24:27,577
So we'll have some,

538
00:24:27,646 --> 00:24:29,773
give Granny some, have some,
give her some.

539
00:24:29,848 --> 00:24:30,906
And then,
Granny will be knocked out.

540
00:24:30,983 --> 00:24:32,575
And we'll get out.

541
00:24:33,252 --> 00:24:35,584
Brilliant idea... Yes! Yes!

542
00:24:35,654 --> 00:24:36,985
No, no, not a brilliant idea.

543
00:24:37,055 --> 00:24:38,579
Are you guys crazy or something?

544
00:24:38,657 --> 00:24:39,715
Have you gone mad?

545
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:41,259
There can't be any rum
or tequila in this house.

546
00:24:41,326 --> 00:24:42,588
l'll be dead.

547
00:24:42,661 --> 00:24:44,185
l'm not gonna touch a single bottle.

548
00:24:45,063 --> 00:24:46,724
Jugs, take this too.

549
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,596
Wow, nice choice, Rhea.

550
00:24:50,269 --> 00:24:51,327
What do you want?

551
00:24:51,937 --> 00:24:52,995
Can't you see?

552
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:54,663
Can't you see?

553
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:03,077
Do we look like we're
less than 21 years old?

554
00:25:03,615 --> 00:25:06,209
You don't even seem
like you're 18 years old.

555
00:25:07,286 --> 00:25:08,753
(Laughs) 17.

556
00:25:12,624 --> 00:25:14,956
Actually, this is not for us.

557
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,684
This is for our Granny.

558
00:25:17,296 --> 00:25:20,094
Sonia, look you've got a double chin.

559
00:25:20,165 --> 00:25:21,826
You've become fat.

560
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,629
Go get yourself a chewing gum

561
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:26,296
Double chin?
- And do some mouth exercises.

562
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:30,167
lt's for our Granny.

563
00:25:30,242 --> 00:25:31,300
Really?

564
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:32,638
Yes.

565
00:25:32,711 --> 00:25:33,837
So, please ask her to come
and fetch it herself.

566
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:37,638
But she's very sick
and this is her medicine.

567
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:42,653
She's not just sick,
she's on her death-bed.

568
00:25:42,721 --> 00:25:45,121
And this is her last wish.

569
00:25:45,324 --> 00:25:47,189
We must fulfill her
last wishes, right?

570
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:50,057
Not everybody's last
wishes are fulfilled, right?

571
00:25:50,329 --> 00:25:51,387
Next!

572
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:54,723
C'mon.

573
00:25:56,335 --> 00:25:57,666
What do we do now?

574
00:25:58,871 --> 00:26:01,339
Karthik... Karthikeyan Ramachandran.

575
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:02,668
What's your problem?

576
00:26:03,008 --> 00:26:04,339
You keep stalking us.

577
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:05,740
What do you want?

578
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:07,142
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys,

579
00:26:07,212 --> 00:26:09,203
come, come, come, come, fast.
- What happened?

580
00:26:09,281 --> 00:26:10,339
Shhh.

581
00:26:12,684 --> 00:26:14,083
Look here.

582
00:26:14,686 --> 00:26:15,744
Fast

583
00:26:15,821 --> 00:26:18,085
lf it were me,
l'd have gone after Rhea too

584
00:26:18,357 --> 00:26:21,155
l'm telling you, man,
Natasha is way hotter.

585
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:23,690
Really? l wasn't aware of that.

586
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:25,690
Obviously, Natasha is way hotter.

587
00:26:25,764 --> 00:26:27,698
But Rhea has higher points, right?

588
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:30,361
Luv has wasted four
months chasing her.

589
00:26:30,702 --> 00:26:31,760
Poor fellow.

590
00:26:31,837 --> 00:26:32,895
l know.

591
00:26:32,971 --> 00:26:35,769
Anyway, he'll get 500 points
with Natasha.

592
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:37,099
Oh yeah.

593
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:39,700
Anyway, where is Luv?

594
00:26:39,912 --> 00:26:42,710
With Plan B, Natasha!

595
00:26:43,048 --> 00:26:44,174
At Carter Road.

596
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,377
Actually, l'm not too far behind.

597
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,848
Tonight, with Maya and Tara,
l'm gonna...

598
00:26:51,924 --> 00:26:53,186
Gonna do what?

599
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:55,383
Get them to make me their brother.

600
00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:57,386
Get them to make me their brother.

601
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:59,054
But why do you wanna do that, dude?

602
00:26:59,131 --> 00:27:00,189
Gollu.

603
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:09,933
l told him to go to the party.

604
00:27:11,743 --> 00:27:13,210
He can't go alone, right?

605
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:16,008
l mean, it's nothing really.

606
00:27:16,081 --> 00:27:17,742
Natasha is just a friend.

607
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,743
Rhea, get real, wake up and
smell the coffee, woman.

608
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:25,082
Natasha was Plan B.

609
00:27:25,157 --> 00:27:26,749
Don't you understand?

610
00:27:27,492 --> 00:27:28,891
Let's go to Carter's.

611
00:27:39,237 --> 00:27:41,171
Do these fellows have to
come in between right now?

612
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:42,297
ldiots!

613
00:27:42,774 --> 00:27:43,832
Move it, guys.

614
00:27:44,443 --> 00:27:46,104
Guys, it cannot be.

615
00:27:46,178 --> 00:27:47,839
Luv loves me a lot.

616
00:27:49,047 --> 00:27:50,241
He really...

617
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:57,317
Oh my God Rhea, that is...

618
00:28:06,465 --> 00:28:08,330
Look, didn't l tell you?

619
00:28:11,203 --> 00:28:13,068
Jugs, you are right.

620
00:28:13,138 --> 00:28:14,196
l won't tolerate this.

621
00:28:14,272 --> 00:28:15,330
l'm gonna go there
and ask him right now.

622
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:17,466
Rhea, Rhea, Rhea,
hold on, just calm down.

623
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:18,804
Don't you have any self-respect?

624
00:28:18,877 --> 00:28:20,811
Do you want to create a big scene
in a public place like this?

625
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:22,813
What scene? l'm gonna
create a climax scene now.

626
00:28:22,881 --> 00:28:24,075
And not the way he wants it.

627
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:25,207
You come with me.

628
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:26,341
Guys, guys
- Juggy.

629
00:28:26,818 --> 00:28:28,479
Karthikeyan, you here again?

630
00:28:28,553 --> 00:28:29,884
Rhea is not the only one.

631
00:28:29,955 --> 00:28:31,820
Stay out of it.

632
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,414
Natasha is also not the only one.

633
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:34,823
What are you saying, Karthikeyan?

634
00:28:35,027 --> 00:28:36,494
This is a very big game.

635
00:28:36,561 --> 00:28:38,085
l'll explain everything.

636
00:28:38,163 --> 00:28:40,154
But you'll have to come with me.

637
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:48,230
Hi.

638
00:28:49,975 --> 00:28:51,237
Enter Password?

639
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,910
Hey, it's me, Karthik.

640
00:28:58,116 --> 00:28:59,378
Enter Password?

641
00:29:02,187 --> 00:29:03,848
Kiss me baby kiss me

642
00:29:07,392 --> 00:29:09,860
Kiss me baby one more time

643
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:24,933
Come in.

644
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,205
Guys, my older brother.

645
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,337
Daman

646
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:32,274
G-l-R-L-S!!!

647
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,874
Hey, the...

648
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:36,612
BBC.

649
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,890
This is the BBC.

650
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,359
Billionaires Boys' Club.

651
00:29:43,428 --> 00:29:45,896
A super exclusive network

652
00:29:45,964 --> 00:29:49,092
that connects some of
lndia's richest kids.

653
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:50,498
But what happens on this site?

654
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:51,627
On this site,

655
00:29:51,903 --> 00:29:54,895
these guys upload
pictures and videos of girls.

656
00:29:54,973 --> 00:29:58,306
You know, er... umm...
those, er... types of...

657
00:29:58,376 --> 00:30:00,105
Stop that, we get it!

658
00:30:00,178 --> 00:30:01,304
No, but these are dares.

659
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:03,912
Dude, these are all dares.

660
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:06,050
See, l'll show you.

661
00:30:06,451 --> 00:30:11,388
For cleavage shots,
bra shots of girls, kissing shots

662
00:30:11,923 --> 00:30:13,117
Making out

663
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:17,591
And if it's with a teacher,
you get extra points.

664
00:30:18,063 --> 00:30:19,121
Points?

665
00:30:19,397 --> 00:30:20,989
Yeah, it's a competition.

666
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:22,124
See?

667
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,599
Forget Facebook and online games.

668
00:30:23,668 --> 00:30:24,999
This is the new rage.

669
00:30:25,403 --> 00:30:26,927
Of all the rich boys.

670
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:28,996
The game starts at the
beginning of each year.

671
00:30:29,274 --> 00:30:33,210
And the one who collects the maximum
points becomes the BBC King.

672
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:34,336
Top dog.

673
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:40,211
And your friend Luv Nanda is
the highest ranker of the year.

674
00:30:40,485 --> 00:30:43,352
With 9,150 points.

675
00:30:43,421 --> 00:30:45,355
Correct, and of course, he will be.

676
00:30:45,423 --> 00:30:48,950
Look at this, he's making out
with that really hot teacher.

677
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:55,964
Oh my God.

678
00:30:56,968 --> 00:30:58,162
This is Ms. Naaz.

679
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,369
Yes, yes, yeah, Ms. Naaz.

680
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,658
And the competition is
very close this year.

681
00:31:20,725 --> 00:31:23,592
Look, Goldie Gulati from
Chandigarh HR College.

682
00:31:24,196 --> 00:31:25,458
He's just behind Luv.

683
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,054
Only 100 points away.

684
00:31:27,332 --> 00:31:29,061
Yeah, very close fight.

685
00:31:29,534 --> 00:31:31,058
He could beat Luv and win.

686
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:32,327
l don't think so.

687
00:31:32,404 --> 00:31:33,598
lt all depends on tonight.

688
00:31:33,738 --> 00:31:35,069
Tonight?

689
00:31:37,676 --> 00:31:40,474
Aren't you and Luv
supposed to be doing it tonight?

690
00:31:43,014 --> 00:31:44,072
See.

691
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:45,207
Luv has posted here.

692
00:31:45,283 --> 00:31:48,013
He's gonna be winning
all his points tonight.

693
00:31:48,086 --> 00:31:50,020
Yeah, but how will they prove that

694
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:51,680
they have done something with girls?

695
00:31:52,157 --> 00:31:53,215
Hidden cameras.

696
00:31:53,491 --> 00:31:54,549
See this?

697
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:56,150
This is a live feed
from Gollu's house.

698
00:31:56,561 --> 00:32:00,224
These guys shoot
everything and upload it.

699
00:32:03,568 --> 00:32:06,036
Look, in fact, something
is being uploaded right now.

700
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:08,232
God, they're disgusting

701
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:14,042
lf all this is about points...

702
00:32:15,447 --> 00:32:17,711
What will get the maximum points?

703
00:32:17,782 --> 00:32:19,306
A thousand points.

704
00:32:20,252 --> 00:32:23,244
The big score is for the cutest,

705
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:25,789
simplest, prettiest and purest girl.

706
00:32:41,206 --> 00:32:43,606
lf all this was a secret,
how did you come to know?

707
00:32:44,476 --> 00:32:45,534
My brother is a freak.

708
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:48,142
No, l mean, my bro
is a computer freak.

709
00:32:48,747 --> 00:32:50,271
When were you planning to tell me?

710
00:32:50,348 --> 00:32:52,748
When CDs were selling on the streets?

711
00:32:52,817 --> 00:32:54,079
ldiot!

712
00:32:55,754 --> 00:32:56,812
Moron.

713
00:32:58,356 --> 00:32:59,414
This is why...

714
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:00,549
This is why l wasn't telling you.

715
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:04,090
Whenever l come to
tell you, you shout at me.

716
00:33:04,162 --> 00:33:05,356
Actually he's right.

717
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,756
That's exactly why he didn't tell us.

718
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:08,298
lt's because of your anger.

719
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:09,492
You are responsible.

720
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:10,625
lt's your fault.

721
00:33:10,702 --> 00:33:11,760
This is not my fault.

722
00:33:11,836 --> 00:33:13,098
This is all your fault, Sonia.

723
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:14,229
You used to tell her.

724
00:33:14,306 --> 00:33:15,364
Go out with Luv.

725
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,771
Sit in his car.

726
00:33:16,841 --> 00:33:18,103
Who used to say that?

727
00:33:18,176 --> 00:33:19,234
So, you should have stopped her.

728
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:20,573
You always interfere.

729
00:33:20,645 --> 00:33:23,170
No, no, it's not our thing,
let's not interfere.

730
00:33:23,248 --> 00:33:24,306
lt's her life.

731
00:33:24,382 --> 00:33:25,440
How am l supposed to know that

732
00:33:25,517 --> 00:33:26,575
Luv would turn out like this?

733
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:28,778
l'm a much better judge of character.

734
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:30,718
Hear me out sometime.

735
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:31,847
She ran away.

736
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,654
Chuck it, Rhea.

737
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:52,196
And anyway, don't waste
your tears on that duffer.

738
00:34:52,737 --> 00:34:54,602
l will get his tears out.

739
00:34:55,206 --> 00:34:58,198
l will make Luv the dude,
completely nude.

740
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,269
Jugs, let it be.

741
00:35:01,346 --> 00:35:02,608
What do you mean, let it be?

742
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,738
You might be cool with it

743
00:35:03,815 --> 00:35:04,873
But l'm not.

744
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:06,211
Nobody messes around with

745
00:35:06,284 --> 00:35:07,342
my best friend and gets away with it.

746
00:35:12,957 --> 00:35:14,686
For once, l agree with Jugs.

747
00:35:16,428 --> 00:35:17,895
We must do something.

748
00:35:17,962 --> 00:35:19,224
Thank you.

749
00:35:21,499 --> 00:35:22,557
What will you do?

750
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,231
Don't you guys get it?

751
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,366
l loved him.

752
00:35:33,578 --> 00:35:37,241
l thought he was the one for me.

753
00:35:41,252 --> 00:35:46,246
l'm here and he's there with Natasha.

754
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:50,519
lt's all over.

755
00:35:51,396 --> 00:35:52,658
Everything is finished.

756
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:01,803
Maybe, there was
something wrong with me.

757
00:36:01,873 --> 00:36:02,931
l know it.

758
00:36:07,278 --> 00:36:10,270
Excuse me, that's my best
friend you're talking about.

759
00:36:10,348 --> 00:36:12,282
l'll break your teeth
if you say anything about her!

760
00:36:13,618 --> 00:36:16,018
Babe, don't you get it,
you are perfect.

761
00:36:16,955 --> 00:36:18,286
She's right, babes.

762
00:36:20,024 --> 00:36:22,618
Girls, girls.

763
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:26,888
lt has been uploaded.

764
00:36:26,965 --> 00:36:28,023
What?

765
00:36:29,634 --> 00:36:30,692
See it for yourself.

766
00:36:30,768 --> 00:36:32,497
l don't wanna watch. l'm going home.

767
00:36:35,306 --> 00:36:37,706
One thousand points!

768
00:36:37,775 --> 00:36:41,768
Luv
- l love you baby - l love you too

769
00:36:42,647 --> 00:36:45,639
Watch me
- Luv Nanda

770
00:36:45,984 --> 00:36:48,578
Win my 1000 points tonight, yeah!

771
00:37:03,868 --> 00:37:04,926
Luv Nanda

772
00:37:07,672 --> 00:37:10,004
you've broken my heart.

773
00:37:13,011 --> 00:37:16,344
And now, this sweet, simple,...

774
00:37:16,414 --> 00:37:20,612
...girl will break you!

775
00:37:21,753 --> 00:37:24,881
l swear on my psycho Granny

776
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:30,686
That l am going to have your ****!!

777
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:35,898
You are not going to
forget my 18th birthday

778
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,364
For as long as you live.

779
00:37:42,106 --> 00:37:46,509
lt's time to put an end to Luv.

780
00:37:53,785 --> 00:37:55,377
Alright girls, listen up.

781
00:37:55,653 --> 00:37:57,712
Luv Nanda is a loser.

782
00:37:57,789 --> 00:37:58,847
Hell, yeah.

783
00:37:58,923 --> 00:38:00,447
And like every womanizer,

784
00:38:00,525 --> 00:38:01,856
there are some things in his life

785
00:38:01,926 --> 00:38:02,984
that make him look like a winner.

786
00:38:03,394 --> 00:38:05,385
Luv Nanda has four Cs.

787
00:38:05,463 --> 00:38:08,398
That makes his life rise
from sea level to this.

788
00:38:08,466 --> 00:38:12,869
And we are going to
take him down, one by one.

789
00:38:12,937 --> 00:38:14,996
And get him to sink.

790
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,934
C number 1?

791
00:38:17,008 --> 00:38:18,066
Car.

792
00:38:18,142 --> 00:38:19,404
Luv's biggest love.

793
00:38:19,477 --> 00:38:23,880
He can bleed, but he can't stand
the sight of a scratch on his car.

794
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:25,607
C number 2?

795
00:38:25,683 --> 00:38:26,741
Cash.

796
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:28,950
lt's his dad's money...

797
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,419
His dad's smuggled money.

798
00:38:32,156 --> 00:38:33,418
C number 3?

799
00:38:33,491 --> 00:38:34,549
Charm.

800
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:38,027
Luv thinks his smooth
talking impresses the girls.

801
00:38:38,696 --> 00:38:39,958
Well, not any more.

802
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:42,829
Today, we're gonna hurt
him in such places that

803
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,629
girls will never come
near him ever again.

804
00:38:44,702 --> 00:38:47,500
And the final C? His cronies.

805
00:38:47,572 --> 00:38:50,439
l will
- No, we will - Make sure that

806
00:38:50,508 --> 00:38:54,911
all his followers
unfollow him tonight.

807
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:59,439
And then, all alone
and carless, cashless,

808
00:38:59,784 --> 00:39:05,120
charmless and cronies-less,
Luv Nanda will become Lovely Nanda.

809
00:39:05,189 --> 00:39:06,986
Hey
- Wait a minute.

810
00:39:07,058 --> 00:39:08,719
This was just a plan.

811
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,452
How are we gonna
execute Luv Nanda... er

812
00:39:10,795 --> 00:39:12,922
l mean, how will we execute the plan?

813
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:15,190
Follow me.

814
00:39:15,466 --> 00:39:16,990
l have had enough

815
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:18,729
Tell me, tell me

816
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:20,668
Whatever happened was too much

817
00:39:20,738 --> 00:39:24,003
This love that has happened

818
00:39:24,075 --> 00:39:26,009
Has gone up in smoke

819
00:39:26,077 --> 00:39:29,478
Gotta give it back

820
00:39:29,547 --> 00:39:32,948
Go tell the boys

821
00:39:33,017 --> 00:39:36,612
Show them the mirror

822
00:39:36,688 --> 00:39:38,553
We're gonna show them now

823
00:39:38,623 --> 00:39:40,147
And how, and how

824
00:39:40,224 --> 00:39:44,160
Gotta give it back

825
00:39:44,228 --> 00:39:45,957
Yeah yeah!

826
00:39:46,964 --> 00:39:48,829
Luv luv luv

827
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,629
lt's the end of Luv

828
00:39:50,702 --> 00:39:54,160
l don't wanna see luv again

829
00:39:54,238 --> 00:39:57,639
What does he think of himself?

830
00:39:57,709 --> 00:40:01,167
This is the end of Luv

831
00:40:01,245 --> 00:40:02,974
Luv Luv Luv

832
00:40:03,047 --> 00:40:04,844
The end of Luv

833
00:40:04,916 --> 00:40:08,511
l don't wanna see luv again

834
00:40:08,586 --> 00:40:11,783
l've decided and it will happen

835
00:40:11,856 --> 00:40:15,656
This is the end

836
00:40:15,727 --> 00:40:17,592
Na na na na nah

837
00:40:17,662 --> 00:40:19,186
Woahoah

838
00:40:19,263 --> 00:40:20,730
Na na na na nah

839
00:40:30,074 --> 00:40:32,201
l'm calling dad right now.

840
00:40:32,276 --> 00:40:34,210
He's not my boyfriend, Mints.

841
00:40:34,278 --> 00:40:36,746
But he was your
boyfriend till this afternoon.

842
00:40:36,814 --> 00:40:39,874
What do you want? Just tell us.

843
00:40:39,951 --> 00:40:41,213
Let's do something.

844
00:40:41,753 --> 00:40:44,551
We'll talk like adults.

845
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:50,026
l'll give you my red
coloured Guess bag.

846
00:40:50,161 --> 00:40:51,628
And your Freddie Kapoor poster.

847
00:40:51,696 --> 00:40:52,754
No way.

848
00:40:54,966 --> 00:40:59,096
The poster is just
a goodwill signing amount, sis.

849
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:03,571
The rest will cost you big.

850
00:41:04,575 --> 00:41:05,633
What else do you want?

851
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,234
Your new pink Mango top.

852
00:41:07,311 --> 00:41:08,573
No chance.

853
00:41:08,646 --> 00:41:10,637
l'll give you my
yellow La Senza night suit.

854
00:41:10,715 --> 00:41:11,909
And your red Aldo boots.

855
00:41:11,983 --> 00:41:13,109
And my Nine-West sandals.

856
00:41:13,184 --> 00:41:14,242
Deal?

857
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,778
Deal.

858
00:41:23,928 --> 00:41:26,590
Uncle, please come here.

859
00:41:27,598 --> 00:41:29,065
Hey, you, come over here.

860
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:31,926
What is it?

861
00:41:32,003 --> 00:41:33,061
ls this Luv's house?

862
00:41:33,337 --> 00:41:34,599
Who are you?

863
00:41:34,672 --> 00:41:35,730
Hey, l asked you the question.

864
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:36,865
ls this his house?

865
00:41:36,941 --> 00:41:37,999
Yes, this is Luv's house.

866
00:41:38,075 --> 00:41:39,133
Then give him this.

867
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,268
What's in it?

868
00:41:40,344 --> 00:41:41,606
Bomb.

869
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:42,805
lt's just a gift.

870
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,938
A girl has sent it for him.

871
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:45,073
Give it to him.

872
00:41:45,149 --> 00:41:46,275
Oh, so they are friends.

873
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,612
Maybe.

874
00:41:47,685 --> 00:41:48,743
Your button is open.

875
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,878
Your boss won't like it.

876
00:41:56,027 --> 00:41:58,154
Hi Timmy, looking hot, huh?

877
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:03,758
There's just four per cent body fat.

878
00:42:03,835 --> 00:42:05,234
Wow... really?

879
00:42:05,303 --> 00:42:06,361
lt's not a big deal.

880
00:42:06,904 --> 00:42:09,168
You should be a part of
those instructional videos.

881
00:42:10,308 --> 00:42:13,641
So that girls like
me can learn from it.

882
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:16,237
Really?

883
00:42:16,314 --> 00:42:19,112
ln fact, let's make one now.

884
00:42:19,717 --> 00:42:21,184
Do you have a camera on your phone?

885
00:42:23,654 --> 00:42:24,712
5 megapixels.

886
00:42:24,989 --> 00:42:26,047
Wow.

887
00:42:27,658 --> 00:42:28,716
Ready, Timmy?

888
00:42:28,793 --> 00:42:29,851
l'm always ready.

889
00:42:34,131 --> 00:42:35,325
Jugs.

890
00:43:00,691 --> 00:43:01,749
We've imported it from Dubai...

891
00:43:01,826 --> 00:43:02,884
l often tell Mr. Nanda...

892
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,224
He's such a player!

893
00:43:05,296 --> 00:43:06,695
He's a shark!

894
00:44:06,223 --> 00:44:08,748
Hey video killed the radio star...

895
00:44:09,026 --> 00:44:10,891
What shoulders, man!

896
00:44:12,029 --> 00:44:13,087
Yeah, come on.

897
00:44:13,164 --> 00:44:14,222
Ten more.

898
00:44:14,966 --> 00:44:17,161
Timmy, your chest, man.

899
00:44:17,902 --> 00:44:19,028
No sweat.

900
00:44:19,437 --> 00:44:20,495
Freak.

901
00:44:24,775 --> 00:44:28,108
Timmy, Timmy, l need to go.

902
00:44:28,179 --> 00:44:29,441
l forgot my gym card.

903
00:44:29,847 --> 00:44:30,905
Here's your phone.

904
00:44:31,182 --> 00:44:32,774
See you at Gollu's party.

905
00:44:38,189 --> 00:44:39,850
How you doin'?

906
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:43,458
Jugs, Jugs, come in.

907
00:44:45,262 --> 00:44:46,320
You okay?

908
00:44:46,397 --> 00:44:48,922
Yeah, l've been swinging
from trees for years now.

909
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,058
Pull me.

910
00:44:50,801 --> 00:44:52,268
Quick, quick.

911
00:44:52,336 --> 00:44:53,928
We're already late.

912
00:44:54,005 --> 00:44:55,336
Here, take this.

913
00:44:55,406 --> 00:44:56,805
Go, go wild.

914
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:50,918
Dammit

915
00:45:57,868 --> 00:46:03,067
Ah, dammit, dammit,
my eyes, stupid soap.

916
00:46:15,219 --> 00:46:16,277
Hello.

917
00:46:16,353 --> 00:46:17,945
Dude, everything will be visible.

918
00:46:18,889 --> 00:46:22,290
l mean, l'm getting TV
coverage for my party.

919
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:23,883
Zoom & Zee.

920
00:46:23,961 --> 00:46:25,553
Nice man, who set it up?

921
00:46:25,629 --> 00:46:26,891
My dad set it up.

922
00:46:26,964 --> 00:46:28,226
And with Freddie Kapoor here

923
00:46:28,299 --> 00:46:30,233
We're gonna get the
entire Bombay Times spread.

924
00:46:30,501 --> 00:46:31,559
Very cool, man.

925
00:46:31,635 --> 00:46:32,897
l'm just in the shower.

926
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:34,028
Let me just call you back, man.

927
00:46:34,105 --> 00:46:35,163
When are you coming over?

928
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:37,036
Right after Thai Jungle with Natasha.

929
00:46:37,108 --> 00:46:40,908
Dude, Thai Jungle,
you're like the dude, man.

930
00:46:40,978 --> 00:46:43,105
Like such a player.

931
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,238
You're like...

932
00:46:44,315 --> 00:46:47,375
lf Rajnikanth married Jackie Chan...

933
00:46:47,451 --> 00:46:50,511
And they had a kid who
married James Bond...

934
00:46:50,588 --> 00:46:51,919
And they had a kid...

935
00:46:51,989 --> 00:46:54,253
You would be a bigger
player than that guy too.

936
00:46:54,325 --> 00:46:56,316
You're like if Bill
Clinton and Ashley Cole...

937
00:46:56,393 --> 00:46:57,451
Right, man...

938
00:46:58,596 --> 00:47:01,064
Hello, Luv?

939
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,931
Reception... damn!

940
00:47:21,218 --> 00:47:22,276
Come on, jump.

941
00:47:23,087 --> 00:47:25,282
Are you mad?

942
00:47:25,356 --> 00:47:26,414
J-U-M-P

943
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:27,957
l'm scared of heights.

944
00:47:28,292 --> 00:47:29,953
C'mon jump... l'm here.

945
00:47:30,027 --> 00:47:31,153
Think of something else.

946
00:47:31,228 --> 00:47:32,354
l can't jump.

947
00:47:33,497 --> 00:47:34,964
Don't worry, l'll catch you.

948
00:47:36,634 --> 00:47:37,692
Sure?

949
00:47:37,968 --> 00:47:39,026
Promise.

950
00:47:39,103 --> 00:47:40,161
You'll catch me, right?

951
00:47:40,237 --> 00:47:41,295
100 per cent.

952
00:47:41,372 --> 00:47:42,964
Okay, on the count of three.

953
00:47:43,507 --> 00:47:44,974
One... One

954
00:47:45,376 --> 00:47:46,968
Two... Two

955
00:47:47,044 --> 00:47:48,568
And... Three

956
00:47:52,249 --> 00:47:54,046
Sorry, l shouldn't have moved.

957
00:47:54,118 --> 00:47:55,176
Don't laugh.

958
00:47:55,252 --> 00:47:57,049
Never jumping off a
window for you again.

959
00:47:57,454 --> 00:47:59,046
Skinny!

960
00:47:59,657 --> 00:48:01,648
Hey Jugs, what happened?

961
00:48:01,725 --> 00:48:02,987
Ask Skinny here.

962
00:48:03,661 --> 00:48:05,390
You tell me, what happened at the gym?

963
00:48:05,462 --> 00:48:07,054
Operation Number Switch complete.

964
00:48:07,131 --> 00:48:08,189
And you tell us.

965
00:48:08,265 --> 00:48:09,994
Operation Butt Break also complete.

966
00:48:10,067 --> 00:48:11,125
What?

967
00:48:11,202 --> 00:48:12,999
Here, Karthik,
take Luv Nanda's credit cards.

968
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:17,006
And Karthik, Luv's credit card
bill should be as perverted as him.

969
00:48:17,074 --> 00:48:18,541
The filthier the better.

970
00:48:18,609 --> 00:48:19,667
Exactly

971
00:48:19,743 --> 00:48:21,005
Come let's go sit in the car...

972
00:48:29,019 --> 00:48:31,351
Guys, it's 9:30,
Luv has not yet come out.

973
00:48:33,757 --> 00:48:35,486
Hey Son, if l message
Timmy from my phone,

974
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:39,017
he will think Luv has
messaged him. Right?

975
00:48:39,363 --> 00:48:41,422
Obviously babes,
l've removed Luv's number

976
00:48:41,498 --> 00:48:43,363
from Timmy's phone and
replaced it with yours.

977
00:48:43,434 --> 00:48:44,696
Try it... Message him.

978
00:48:44,768 --> 00:48:46,030
Okay okay...

979
00:48:46,103 --> 00:48:51,040
Hey dude, really like...

980
00:48:51,108 --> 00:48:54,703
...your body lately.

981
00:48:55,579 --> 00:48:57,376
Looking ripped.

982
00:49:28,612 --> 00:49:31,604
Ha ha... it works. He's so dumb, man.

983
00:49:33,284 --> 00:49:36,219
He's so dumb...
super dumb... seriously.

984
00:49:36,287 --> 00:49:38,482
Oh my God, guys... hide.

985
00:49:44,361 --> 00:49:47,762
Quickly, follow him.

986
00:49:47,831 --> 00:49:49,492
Okay, wassup with the glasses?

987
00:49:49,566 --> 00:49:50,624
Night vision.

988
00:49:50,701 --> 00:49:51,759
Really?

989
00:49:51,835 --> 00:49:53,097
Hey, l'm just trying to
look cool. Now, let's go.

990
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:54,637
Looks like your boyfriend beat you up.

991
00:49:54,705 --> 00:49:55,763
Let's move
- Quickly.

992
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,101
Okay on the side, superb!

993
00:49:57,174 --> 00:49:58,232
Yes.

994
00:50:08,118 --> 00:50:10,245
Jugs, you called your brother, right?

995
00:50:10,321 --> 00:50:11,379
Hey, he's round the corner.

996
00:50:11,455 --> 00:50:12,513
He'll be here in a couple of minutes.

997
00:50:17,728 --> 00:50:18,786
This one and that bouquet.

998
00:50:18,862 --> 00:50:20,124
Look how sweet he is.

999
00:50:20,197 --> 00:50:22,597
Buying flowers for Natasha.

1000
00:50:28,539 --> 00:50:31,133
Now the sweetness is going to
show up in his life, darling.

1001
00:50:31,342 --> 00:50:34,140
Now his car will move only in reverse.

1002
00:50:46,156 --> 00:50:47,214
Hey.

1003
00:50:52,296 --> 00:50:53,354
Stop.

1004
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:54,692
Do you know who l am?

1005
00:50:58,569 --> 00:50:59,831
What the hell, man?

1006
00:51:03,173 --> 00:51:04,231
Hey.

1007
00:51:06,844 --> 00:51:08,243
Run Luv Nanda, run.

1008
00:51:08,512 --> 00:51:09,843
Let's go.

1009
00:51:09,913 --> 00:51:11,175
Hey, stop.

1010
00:51:11,248 --> 00:51:12,306
What the hell, man?

1011
00:51:13,183 --> 00:51:15,174
Hey stop!

1012
00:51:21,792 --> 00:51:22,850
Stop.

1013
00:51:31,201 --> 00:51:32,259
Dammit.

1014
00:51:32,336 --> 00:51:33,394
Come back.

1015
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:34,528
Shit.

1016
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:40,668
Dammit.

1017
00:51:51,755 --> 00:51:54,223
Thanks bro, l owe you
big time for this one.

1018
00:51:54,425 --> 00:51:56,825
Here child, the keys to your new car.

1019
00:51:59,963 --> 00:52:03,694
Whatever they please, they do

1020
00:52:03,767 --> 00:52:07,225
and then they get away, away

1021
00:52:07,304 --> 00:52:10,637
lt just ain't fair, ain't fair...

1022
00:52:10,707 --> 00:52:14,438
Gotta give it back

1023
00:52:14,845 --> 00:52:16,244
l love you, Rhea.

1024
00:52:16,313 --> 00:52:18,440
You're not with some random guy,

1025
00:52:18,515 --> 00:52:19,573
You're with me.

1026
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:20,708
Your Luv.

1027
00:52:20,784 --> 00:52:22,911
They will never forget...

1028
00:52:22,986 --> 00:52:24,248
Trust me.

1029
00:52:24,321 --> 00:52:26,380
l've been waiting for so long.

1030
00:52:26,457 --> 00:52:28,254
And now that l've found you,

1031
00:52:28,325 --> 00:52:30,259
l can't wait any longer.

1032
00:52:30,928 --> 00:52:32,657
Go **** Yourself!

1033
00:52:32,729 --> 00:52:36,392
lt's the end of Luv

1034
00:52:36,467 --> 00:52:39,868
l don't wanna see Luv again

1035
00:52:39,937 --> 00:52:43,338
What does he think of himself

1036
00:52:43,407 --> 00:52:46,934
lt's the end of Luv

1037
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:50,468
Luv Luv Luv
- the end of Luv

1038
00:52:50,547 --> 00:52:53,948
l don't wanna see Luv again

1039
00:52:54,284 --> 00:52:57,617
What l have decided
- Will surely happen

1040
00:52:57,688 --> 00:53:01,419
lt's the end of Luv...

1041
00:53:25,983 --> 00:53:27,848
Oh my God!

1042
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:29,717
Oh my God!

1043
00:53:37,728 --> 00:53:38,786
Oh God!

1044
00:53:39,329 --> 00:53:40,387
Oh my dad's gonna kill me.

1045
00:53:40,464 --> 00:53:41,522
Oh my God.

1046
00:53:41,598 --> 00:53:42,656
My dad's gonna kill me.

1047
00:53:42,733 --> 00:53:43,791
Oh God, my baby.

1048
00:53:43,867 --> 00:53:44,925
Oh Baby.

1049
00:53:47,804 --> 00:53:48,862
Oh God!

1050
00:53:49,339 --> 00:53:52,467
Aw, poor baby...

1051
00:53:53,076 --> 00:53:54,543
Dammit.

1052
00:53:56,346 --> 00:53:57,404
Shit.

1053
00:54:05,689 --> 00:54:06,883
Dammit.

1054
00:54:07,357 --> 00:54:08,415
Shit.

1055
00:54:12,029 --> 00:54:14,020
Hey, do you think
we've gone overboard?

1056
00:54:14,097 --> 00:54:15,359
No way.

1057
00:54:15,432 --> 00:54:16,831
This is just the trailer.

1058
00:54:18,969 --> 00:54:21,767
The movie's only just getting started!

1059
00:54:30,347 --> 00:54:32,281
See, l told you guys, we did too much.

1060
00:54:32,349 --> 00:54:33,680
What if Luv Nanda
doesn't turn up here?

1061
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:36,275
lt would have been too much
if we had run him over with the car.

1062
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:37,411
He'll come.

1063
00:54:38,421 --> 00:54:40,685
He needs his 500 points.

1064
00:54:41,758 --> 00:54:45,888
Because Luv Nanda
doesn't like to lose.

1065
00:54:49,299 --> 00:54:53,099
Umm, Natasha, thanks for
getting your dad's car.

1066
00:54:55,972 --> 00:54:58,099
Your phone has rung
five times already.

1067
00:54:58,441 --> 00:55:00,966
l think you have a habit of
picking up everything late.

1068
00:55:01,044 --> 00:55:02,102
Don't you?

1069
00:55:02,779 --> 00:55:04,371
l was just gonna pick it up.

1070
00:55:06,116 --> 00:55:08,448
Hey, Dad.
- A 50 lakh rupee car.

1071
00:55:08,785 --> 00:55:10,446
You've trashed it?

1072
00:55:11,121 --> 00:55:12,782
Have you gone mad?
- But Dad...

1073
00:55:12,856 --> 00:55:14,323
Who do you think is
gonna pay for it? Your Dad?

1074
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:16,720
No, you're gonna pay me.

1075
00:55:16,793 --> 00:55:17,851
Tomorrow onwards

1076
00:55:17,928 --> 00:55:19,862
you're gonna travel by an
auto-rickshaw to college. - But...

1077
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:21,727
Take the bus to college.
- But...

1078
00:55:21,798 --> 00:55:22,856
From tomorrow onwards,

1079
00:55:22,933 --> 00:55:23,991
you are gonna walk everywhere you go.
- But Dad?

1080
00:55:24,067 --> 00:55:25,125
Do you get it?

1081
00:55:25,201 --> 00:55:26,259
You. Will. Walk.

1082
00:55:28,471 --> 00:55:30,405
l love you too Dad, l love you too.

1083
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:35,739
Your Dad sounded really angry.

1084
00:55:35,812 --> 00:55:36,870
All okay?

1085
00:55:37,948 --> 00:55:40,883
Of course baby, my Dad loves me a lot.

1086
00:55:40,951 --> 00:55:43,818
He wants to buy me another car.

1087
00:55:50,894 --> 00:55:52,759
Babes, it's already 10:20 pm.

1088
00:55:53,964 --> 00:55:55,158
Duck! Duck!

1089
00:55:55,231 --> 00:55:57,358
Jugs, it's not duck, it's...

1090
00:55:59,769 --> 00:56:01,293
Okay guys, move on.

1091
00:56:07,777 --> 00:56:08,835
What do you want now, Minty?

1092
00:56:08,912 --> 00:56:11,107
For the next three years,
all your new outfits are mine.

1093
00:56:11,181 --> 00:56:12,443
What? Why?

1094
00:56:12,515 --> 00:56:15,313
Because l have to give
Granny a sponge bath now. - Why?

1095
00:56:15,385 --> 00:56:17,444
Because Granny has to
get ready for your party.

1096
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,782
Mom was saying that

1097
00:56:18,855 --> 00:56:21,323
Granny hasn't had a
bath in the last 20 years.

1098
00:56:23,126 --> 00:56:24,184
Oh my God!

1099
00:56:24,527 --> 00:56:25,789
What happened?

1100
00:56:25,862 --> 00:56:27,523
Granny has taken off all her clothes.

1101
00:56:28,531 --> 00:56:30,522
Granny, you said sponge bath.

1102
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,062
What are you doing inside the tub?

1103
00:56:32,402 --> 00:56:35,803
Hey, l've been waiting
here for the last 10 minutes.

1104
00:56:36,072 --> 00:56:38,267
Don't look at me like that.
Come give me a scrub.

1105
00:56:39,542 --> 00:56:42,204
Sis?
- Okay Minty, what do you want now?

1106
00:56:42,278 --> 00:56:43,472
First, you get back.

1107
00:56:43,546 --> 00:56:45,013
Then we'll negotiate.

1108
00:56:45,081 --> 00:56:48,881
But for starters, all your pocket
money for the rest of the year...

1109
00:56:48,952 --> 00:56:51,216
Just one month's
pocket money. That's it.

1110
00:56:51,287 --> 00:56:53,881
Hello, you're not street shopping.

1111
00:56:54,557 --> 00:56:55,819
No bargaining!

1112
00:56:55,892 --> 00:56:57,826
Fine Minty, deal!

1113
00:56:57,894 --> 00:56:58,952
You brat! Bye!

1114
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:04,827
Granny, how many years has it been...

1115
00:57:04,901 --> 00:57:06,300
...since you had your last bath?

1116
00:57:12,575 --> 00:57:13,837
Thank you.

1117
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:20,508
Baby, l'm so sorry l was late.

1118
00:57:21,985 --> 00:57:24,579
Let's forget this
confusion about the car.

1119
00:57:24,921 --> 00:57:26,445
Let's try and enjoy ourselves.

1120
00:57:26,589 --> 00:57:27,851
Please.

1121
00:57:28,591 --> 00:57:29,922
Good. See?

1122
00:57:31,528 --> 00:57:32,995
l got this just for you.

1123
00:57:34,064 --> 00:57:35,190
Baked it myself.

1124
00:57:38,001 --> 00:57:39,127
So you can cook?

1125
00:57:39,936 --> 00:57:40,994
No, l don't know how to cook.

1126
00:57:41,538 --> 00:57:45,133
But for you baby,
everything just comes from here.

1127
00:57:45,875 --> 00:57:48,139
Ahh... Yes.

1128
00:57:48,945 --> 00:57:50,003
Luv?

1129
00:57:51,548 --> 00:57:52,606
L-U-V?

1130
00:57:53,349 --> 00:57:55,214
Oh, no, no, babes.

1131
00:57:55,285 --> 00:57:57,947
Tonight is very special for us.

1132
00:57:58,888 --> 00:58:02,016
Let's forget
everything and start afresh.

1133
00:58:03,893 --> 00:58:04,951
What do you say?

1134
00:58:07,363 --> 00:58:08,421
Hi.

1135
00:58:08,898 --> 00:58:09,956
Reservations?

1136
00:58:10,033 --> 00:58:11,625
Can we just sit at the bar, please?

1137
00:58:11,901 --> 00:58:14,893
Sorry darling, no reservations,
no entry.

1138
00:58:15,038 --> 00:58:16,096
Just want to sit at the bar.

1139
00:58:16,172 --> 00:58:17,230
That's it.

1140
00:58:18,441 --> 00:58:19,635
Look at yourselves.

1141
00:58:20,577 --> 00:58:22,374
The way you're dressed,

1142
00:58:22,445 --> 00:58:23,571
Forget the bar.

1143
00:58:23,646 --> 00:58:26,046
You won't even be allowed
to stand outside the gate.

1144
00:58:26,116 --> 00:58:27,447
So... excuse me.

1145
00:58:27,917 --> 00:58:29,043
Susanne Ramani and group?

1146
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,110
No, Malini Tiwari Group.

1147
00:58:31,187 --> 00:58:32,245
Right!

1148
00:58:32,989 --> 00:58:34,047
Follow me, please.

1149
00:58:34,924 --> 00:58:35,982
Hey!

1150
00:58:40,396 --> 00:58:41,454
What do we do now?

1151
00:58:42,465 --> 00:58:43,523
Rhea...

1152
00:58:45,401 --> 00:58:46,459
Follow me.

1153
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:11,618
Hi.

1154
00:59:11,694 --> 00:59:12,956
Good evening.

1155
00:59:13,029 --> 00:59:14,087
May l help you?

1156
00:59:14,164 --> 00:59:15,631
Susanne Ramani and group.

1157
00:59:16,032 --> 00:59:17,624
Yes, of course,
this way please, madam.

1158
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,294
Actually sweetie,
we'd rather sit at the bar.

1159
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:21,428
Of course

1160
00:59:24,974 --> 00:59:26,032
Luv?

1161
00:59:26,576 --> 00:59:27,634
Everything okay?

1162
00:59:28,444 --> 00:59:30,708
The world's prettiest woman
is sitting in front of me.

1163
00:59:31,581 --> 00:59:34,311
How can everything not be okay?

1164
00:59:35,718 --> 00:59:39,051
Well, you did take forever to notice

1165
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:41,982
Natasha, don't be stupid baby.

1166
00:59:42,992 --> 00:59:44,050
Ever since l saw you

1167
00:59:44,127 --> 00:59:45,185
l have wanted you.

1168
00:59:45,595 --> 00:59:46,994
From the first day...

Thank you.

1170
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,258
Welcome sir. Thank you.

1171
00:59:52,669 --> 00:59:55,467
From the first day, the first second

1172
00:59:56,005 --> 00:59:59,463
l just didn't want to
make any wrong mo-oo-ooves.

1173
01:00:00,276 --> 01:00:01,334
Wrong moves?

1174
01:00:02,412 --> 01:00:03,470
You know,

1175
01:00:04,013 --> 01:00:05,742
Like coming on too strong.

1176
01:00:06,749 --> 01:00:08,080
l can't itch,

1177
01:00:08,685 --> 01:00:10,744
l didn't want to scratch you,

1178
01:00:11,354 --> 01:00:12,412
l didn't want to lose you.

1179
01:00:16,226 --> 01:00:17,284
Why are you sweating?

1180
01:00:19,229 --> 01:00:23,222
Because you are so hot!

1181
01:00:27,036 --> 01:00:28,094
What do we order now?

1182
01:00:28,171 --> 01:00:29,229
ltch-guard

1183
01:00:29,305 --> 01:00:30,363
WHAT?

1184
01:00:31,574 --> 01:00:32,700
Nothing at all.

1185
01:00:33,443 --> 01:00:35,502
Order anything you like.

1186
01:00:36,579 --> 01:00:38,046
Luv, what are you doing?

1187
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:43,314
Luv, sit down,
everybody is staring at us.

1188
01:00:43,786 --> 01:00:45,185
Stop embarrassing me, Luv.

1189
01:00:45,255 --> 01:00:46,313
Sit down.

1191
01:01:20,757 --> 01:01:22,816
Oh my God

1192
01:01:31,567 --> 01:01:32,625
Excuse me.

1193
01:01:33,836 --> 01:01:36,168
Can you take this drink to that table?

1194
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:37,763
But she shouldn't come to know.

1195
01:01:38,107 --> 01:01:39,165
You know...

1196
01:01:39,242 --> 01:01:40,709
Secret admirer types.

1197
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:42,372
Sir, don't worry.

1198
01:01:42,445 --> 01:01:44,242
lt happens to everyone the first time.

1199
01:01:44,314 --> 01:01:46,248
Please take this cold water.

1200
01:01:46,316 --> 01:01:47,374
Everything will be chilled.

1201
01:01:59,862 --> 01:02:02,456
That feels good... that feels good.

1202
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,738
Drink for the gentleman.

1203
01:02:25,755 --> 01:02:26,813
Oh my God!

1204
01:02:26,889 --> 01:02:28,151
She's eating the cupcake.

1205
01:02:28,358 --> 01:02:29,416
Oh *Shit*!

1206
01:02:30,827 --> 01:02:33,887
She's in deep trouble now.

1207
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:36,892
This is gonna be bad... very bad.

1208
01:02:38,167 --> 01:02:40,692
Luv, this thing is delicious.

1209
01:02:42,305 --> 01:02:43,363
No, no, l'm good.

1210
01:02:43,439 --> 01:02:44,497
Let's just get outta here.
- What?

1211
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:46,433
But what about dinner?

1212

Let's order 2 lakh of these.

1225
01:03:51,307 --> 01:03:52,365
Thank you.

1226
01:03:59,449 --> 01:04:01,644
Nats, Nats, Nats...

1227
01:04:19,469 --> 01:04:20,936
You didn't get your car.

1228
01:04:21,003 --> 01:04:22,334
And you were late.

1229
01:04:22,405 --> 01:04:23,599
And no wallet.

1230
01:04:23,673 --> 01:04:25,402
l had to play the bloody bill.

1231
01:04:25,475 --> 01:04:26,669
Natasha Oberoi.

1232
01:04:26,742 --> 01:04:29,267
l'm not used to going on
such cheap dates, okay?

1233
01:04:30,346 --> 01:04:31,677
What were you trying to prove?

1234
01:04:31,747 --> 01:04:32,805
That l'm desperate?

1235
01:04:33,349 --> 01:04:34,941

How dare you?

1238
01:04:55,771 --> 01:04:57,295
Do you think
Granny's pills are working?

1239
01:04:57,373 --> 01:04:58,431
Chuck that.

1240
01:04:58,508 --> 01:04:59,566
Do you think the cupcakes are working?

1241
01:04:59,909 --> 01:05:02,503
Luv, please stop the car.

Sonia, use your brains at least once.

1415

And where we are?

Hey, we don't wanna get

01:15:17,593 --> 01:15:18,924

Gollu?

1470
01:15:44,019 --> 01:15:46,078
Dude, you should work out more often.

1471
01:15:46,155 --> 01:15:47,281
Look, you're out of shape.

1472
01:15:50,359 --> 01:15:51,951
This isn't called being out of shape,

1473
01:15:52,027 --> 01:15:53,085
This is called being round shaped.

1474
01:15:53,295 --> 01:15:54,421
But... Let it go.

1475
01:15:54,696 --> 01:15:55,958
You won't get it.

1476
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,965
By the way, why were we following Luv?

1477
01:15:59,034 --> 01:16:00,092
l was only running after the girls

1478
01:16:00,169 --> 01:16:01,431
who are gonna come to my party.

1479
01:16:01,703 --> 01:16:04,365
Anyway, Natasha has found her car.

1480
01:16:04,439 --> 01:16:05,963
The girls will come. C'mon.

1481
01:16:08,043 --> 01:16:09,101
Timmy?

1482
01:16:09,511 --> 01:16:10,569
Wait, wait.

1483
01:16:13,649 --> 01:16:14,707
Natasha?

1484
01:16:16,718 --> 01:16:18,185
Yeah, Natasha
- Gollu?

1485
01:16:18,253 --> 01:16:19,379
Luv is in the car.

1486
01:16:19,454 --> 01:16:20,512
What?

1487
01:16:20,589 --> 01:16:21,647
And he's dressed in drag.

1488
01:16:21,723 --> 01:16:22,985
Drag?

1489
01:16:24,059 --> 01:16:25,321
You guys went out on a date

1490
01:16:25,394 --> 01:16:26,452
or out dancing at a ladyboy club?

1491
01:16:26,528 --> 01:16:28,393
Shut up, you pig. l'm taking him home.

1492
01:16:28,463 --> 01:16:29,521
You get to the party.

1493
01:16:34,736 --> 01:16:38,001
Dude, Luv is dressed in drag.

1494
01:16:38,073 --> 01:16:39,131
Yeah, man.

1495
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:41,403
He's been sending me
weird messages since evening.

1496
01:16:41,476 --> 01:16:42,534
What do you mean?

1497
01:16:42,678 --> 01:16:44,475
You know... those kinda messages.

1498
01:16:45,547 --> 01:16:46,605
What kinda messages?

1499
01:16:47,349 --> 01:16:48,407
This kinda.

1500
01:16:51,753 --> 01:16:53,015
Look at this. Read the message.

1501
01:16:55,357 --> 01:16:57,621
Nice body, Timmy looking ripped.

1502
01:17:01,763 --> 01:17:03,025
So what?

1503
01:17:03,232 --> 01:17:05,223
Can't two dudes just be friends?

1504
01:17:06,435 --> 01:17:07,493
Look at this.

1505
01:17:07,569 --> 01:17:09,036
Look at his Facebook page.

1506
01:17:11,773 --> 01:17:13,035
Luv is gay?

1507
01:17:13,775 --> 01:17:15,709
No, man. This can't be.

1508
01:17:15,777 --> 01:17:17,574
Luv doesn't like ladies?
He likes Lady boys?

1509
01:17:17,646 --> 01:17:18,704
No, man.

1510
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:20,441
What about the BBC?

1511
01:17:20,515 --> 01:17:23,109
Miss Naaz? Rhea?

1512
01:17:23,185 --> 01:17:25,050
lt's a cover-up, bro.

1513
01:17:25,387 --> 01:17:27,582
Obviously, he can't
tell the world he's gay.

1514
01:17:27,656 --> 01:17:29,385
Look at this. Look at his tattoo.

1515
01:17:32,461 --> 01:17:34,395
Will you be my gay buddy?

1516
01:17:37,132 --> 01:17:38,190
Oh God!

1517
01:17:40,202 --> 01:17:42,136
Man, Luv is gay.

1518
01:17:45,073 --> 01:17:47,268
But, why is he
sending you these messages?

1519
01:17:47,342 --> 01:17:48,400
What do you mean?

1520
01:17:48,477 --> 01:17:49,535
l should have known.

1521
01:17:49,611 --> 01:17:53,069
When he included the dumbest
guy in college in his group.

1522
01:17:53,148 --> 01:17:54,672
Hey, listen, l'm not dumb.

1523
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:56,081
And if it's such a problem,

1524
01:17:56,151 --> 01:17:57,209
l quit the group.

1525
01:17:57,419 --> 01:17:59,080
K-W-l-T Quit.

1526
01:17:59,621 --> 01:18:02,488
Hey, buddy, Timmy,
l was just joking, man.

1527
01:18:02,557 --> 01:18:03,615
You know me, man.

1528
01:18:03,692 --> 01:18:05,091
l was not serious.

1529
01:18:05,494 --> 01:18:06,756
C'mon, don't be like a
drama queen.

1530
01:18:06,828 --> 01:18:08,762
Don't take so much footage.
- No, no, l'm dumb, right?

1531
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:10,161
That's why people make fun of me.

1532
01:18:10,232 --> 01:18:12,097
Timmy, l was kidding.

1533
01:18:12,167 --> 01:18:13,566
There must be
something you are good at.

1534
01:18:13,635 --> 01:18:14,761
You're so talented.

1535
01:18:14,836 --> 01:18:16,497
There must be
something you are good at.

1536
01:18:16,571 --> 01:18:17,629
l know it.

1537
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:24,445
l can shake my chest muscles.

1538
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:26,774
Yeah? Show us.

1539
01:18:26,848 --> 01:18:28,110
You wanna see, right?

1540
01:18:33,188 --> 01:18:34,246
Look at this.

1541
01:18:34,323 --> 01:18:35,381
Hey, excellent.

1542
01:18:36,325 --> 01:18:38,122
Dude, this is excellent.

1543
01:18:38,193 --> 01:18:39,785
You're so talented.

1544
01:18:39,861 --> 01:18:41,123
l told you.

1545
01:18:41,196 --> 01:18:42,663
Anyway, what are we doing here?

1546
01:18:42,731 --> 01:18:45,598
lt's my house, my party
and we're in the gutter.

1547
01:18:45,667 --> 01:18:47,191
The girls are waiting for us, dude.

1548
01:18:47,269 --> 01:18:48,327
C'mon, let's go.

1549
01:18:49,137 --> 01:18:50,195
l don't think l'll come.

1550
01:18:50,272 --> 01:18:51,330
Why?

1551
01:18:51,473 --> 01:18:52,531
l might just beat him up.

1552
01:18:52,741 --> 01:18:53,799
Hey, don't be crazy.

1553
01:18:53,875 --> 01:18:55,274
Don't touch him by mistake.

1554
01:18:55,344 --> 01:18:56,675
They get turned on by all this.

1555
01:18:57,212 --> 01:18:58,338
Dude, let's go.

1556
01:18:58,413 --> 01:18:59,607
The girls are waiting for us.

1557
01:18:59,681 --> 01:19:00,739
Let's party.

1558
01:19:03,151 --> 01:19:05,619
Yay! Now we have crossed
out 'C' for Cronies too!

1559
01:19:06,621 --> 01:19:08,816
Rhea, my hair is all messy.

1560
01:19:09,691 --> 01:19:11,625
My dear Paris Hilton,

1561
01:19:11,693 --> 01:19:13,285
Can life get any worse than this?

1562
01:19:22,704 --> 01:19:25,229
So you were saying, it
can't get any worse.

1563
01:19:25,907 --> 01:19:27,898
Look at this, it has gotten worse.

1564
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:30,844
l shouldn't have joined
you guys in this plan.

1565
01:19:30,912 --> 01:19:33,779
lf you can't think with
your own head blame your Mom.

1566
01:19:33,849 --> 01:19:35,840
You've got your brains
from her. Don't blame us.

1567
01:19:35,917 --> 01:19:38,511
Hey, don't drag my Mom into this.

1568
01:19:38,587 --> 01:19:41,385
No matter what she's like,
at least she's not crass like you.

1569
01:19:41,456 --> 01:19:44,516
Oh my God, Barbie
just found her voice.

1570
01:19:44,593 --> 01:19:45,855
Now, she's never gonna shut up.

1571
01:19:45,927 --> 01:19:48,794
She's gonna go, Hey girlfriends
Hey girlfriends like her Mum.

1572
01:19:48,864 --> 01:19:50,388
You are just jealous,

1573
01:19:50,732 --> 01:19:52,199
Because l'm thin and you're not.

1574
01:19:52,267 --> 01:19:54,792
l may be jealous,
l may be fat, l may be crass,

1575
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:56,599
but l'm also a very
good fighter, dammit.

1576
01:19:56,671 --> 01:20:00,732
Guys, guys, just stop it, man.

1577
01:20:01,676 --> 01:20:02,734
What are you doing?

1578
01:20:02,811 --> 01:20:04,608
Hit her, slap her.

1579
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:05,737
Let her go.

1580
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:10,884
You think l'm gonna just
sit here and listen to you?

1581
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:13,278
Stop it, guys.

1582
01:20:13,355 --> 01:20:14,413
Mom's calling.

1583
01:20:14,623 --> 01:20:15,681
Shit!

1584
01:20:17,426 --> 01:20:18,757
Hello? Hello?

1585
01:20:18,827 --> 01:20:22,285
You *bitches*, it's that
girl's mother calling.

1586
01:20:22,364 --> 01:20:23,626
Shut up now.

1587
01:20:24,633 --> 01:20:26,430
When will this Mom
of your's stop abusing

1588
01:20:26,501 --> 01:20:28,901
in front of the children?

1589
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:30,232
That's Mum.

1590
01:20:30,305 --> 01:20:31,829
By the way, why did you call?

1591
01:20:31,907 --> 01:20:33,306
lt's 12 o'clock, sweetie.

1592
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:34,637
Happy Birthday.

1593
01:20:36,978 --> 01:20:38,240
Thanks, Mom.

1594
01:20:38,713 --> 01:20:42,706
So how's your girls'
night in coming along?

1595
01:20:42,784 --> 01:20:44,513
What gifts did the girls get you?

1596
01:20:44,586 --> 01:20:45,644
Gifts?

1597
01:20:49,724 --> 01:20:51,385
No, mom, l didn't get any gifts.

1598
01:20:52,327 --> 01:20:56,730
Jugs and Sonia just promised
they wouldn't fight tonight,

1599
01:20:57,265 --> 01:20:58,323
That's their gift.

1600
01:20:59,267 --> 01:21:01,758
Those two girls are so predictable.

1601
01:21:02,671 --> 01:21:06,732
Baby, l'm so sorry we aren't
there with you at this moment.

1602
01:21:07,008 --> 01:21:11,274
But tell you what,
you'll get your gift tomorrow.

1603
01:21:11,346 --> 01:21:13,280
Alright?
- And it's a real big one.

1604
01:21:13,348 --> 01:21:14,406
Yeah.

Hey are you guys at
a funeral or what?

Oh my God.

1629
01:22:26,888 --> 01:22:27,946
Granny.

1630
01:22:36,031 --> 01:22:38,363
You never stop following me.

1631
01:22:39,834 --> 01:22:40,892
Sorry, mom.

1632
01:22:40,969 --> 01:22:42,027

1634
01:22:44,506 --> 01:22:45,564
For the three of you.

1635
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,365
But a police station
for crying out loud?

1636
01:22:48,443 --> 01:22:49,501
Have you lost it?

1637
01:22:50,979 --> 01:22:52,503
Just shut up and get back home.

1638
01:22:54,115 --> 01:22:55,377
Give me the keys.

1639
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,715
Where is the car? Give me the keys.

1640
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:00,382
Which part of Where is the car?

1641
01:23:00,455 --> 01:23:02,116
Give me the keys
do you not understand, Sonia?

1642
01:23:05,927 --> 01:23:07,918
Oh thank God, thank God, thank God.

1643
01:23:07,996 --> 01:23:10,396
Some of these clothes
cost more than the car, man.

1644
01:23:10,465 --> 01:23:11,523
Now tell me.

1645
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:12,726
What happened?

1646
01:23:12,801 --> 01:23:13,859
l'll tell you.

1647
01:23:13,935 --> 01:23:15,061
Good you tell me.

1648
01:23:16,004 --> 01:23:17,665
So it's a boy story.

1649
01:23:24,946 --> 01:23:26,675
l know love is hard, baby.

1650
01:23:28,016 --> 01:23:29,074
l know it.

1651
01:23:30,085 --> 01:23:31,746
lt's not like a Hindi film.

1652
01:23:32,153 --> 01:23:34,815
And l'm so glad you
didn't lock yourself up

1653
01:23:34,889 --> 01:23:36,550
in a room and cry like a loser.

1654
01:23:36,625 --> 01:23:38,684
You gave the guy right back.

1655
01:23:42,163 --> 01:23:43,562
So what if your heart broke,

1656
01:23:44,966 --> 01:23:46,024
At least you knew it
was beating right?

1657
01:23:46,901 --> 01:23:48,425
But Aunty, she was not alone.

1658
01:23:48,503 --> 01:23:49,970
We helped her a lot.

1659
01:23:50,038 --> 01:23:52,768
l know, we girlfriends are so cool.

1660
01:23:52,841 --> 01:23:53,899
Girl power.

1661
01:23:54,643 --> 01:23:56,907
lf my college girlfriends were with me

1662
01:23:56,978 --> 01:23:59,572
l would have definitely
burnt Sonia's Dad's yacht.

1663
01:23:59,848 --> 01:24:02,043
Mom, you have already done that.

1664
01:24:07,188 --> 01:24:08,450
LUV?

1665
01:24:08,523 --> 01:24:09,581
Oh, no, no, no, no,
don't take the call.

1666
01:24:09,658 --> 01:24:10,716
Don't answer.

1667
01:24:10,792 --> 01:24:12,657
No, no, no, no, no, no
- Stop it.

1668
01:24:12,727 --> 01:24:14,456
Rhea, don't answer.

1669
01:24:14,529 --> 01:24:15,587
Luv?

1670
01:24:15,664 --> 01:24:16,722
Happy Birthday, baby.

1671
01:24:17,465 --> 01:24:18,523
Thanks.

1672
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,124
l hope everything is alright at home?

1673
01:24:21,002 --> 01:24:24,460
Yeah, everything's fine... yeah.

1674
01:24:25,206 --> 01:24:26,468
Babes, l love you.

1675
01:24:26,541 --> 01:24:28,736
And you have no idea
what's happened to me tonight.

1676
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:30,875
l really wish l could
see you tonight, babe.

1677
01:24:30,945 --> 01:24:33,072
l really, really, really,
really need you tonight.

1678
01:24:35,216 --> 01:24:38,617
By the way Luv, my
parents are back home.

1679
01:24:39,554 --> 01:24:41,545
l can meet you now if you want.

1680
01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:43,548
Are you serious?

1681
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:46,492
Babes, that's such good news.

1682
01:24:46,561 --> 01:24:47,619
So when do you want to meet?
Where do you want to meet?

1683
01:24:47,696 --> 01:24:48,754
Do you want me to come pick you up?

1684
01:24:48,897 --> 01:24:50,091
Let's meet at Gollu's party.

1685
01:24:50,832 --> 01:24:52,163
Perfect, perfect.

1686
01:24:52,834 --> 01:24:53,892
Perfect!

1687
01:24:56,171 --> 01:24:57,900
What the hell were you saying?
- Hello?

1688
01:24:58,239 --> 01:25:00,901
l can't believe that
after everything he has done.

1689
01:25:00,975 --> 01:25:02,169
He still wants to meet me.

1690
01:25:02,243 --> 01:25:04,040
He has the balls to call me, man.

1691
01:25:04,112 --> 01:25:08,048
He's so desperate for
his 1,000 bloody points.

1692
01:25:08,116 --> 01:25:09,515
What if it's a trap?

1693
01:25:09,584 --> 01:25:10,642
He has no idea we did anything.

1694
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:13,517
He doesn't know about anything we did.

1695
01:25:13,588 --> 01:25:16,523
Looks like what
we did wasn't good enough.

1696
01:25:17,192 --> 01:25:18,523
We must finish what we started.

1697
01:25:18,593 --> 01:25:20,527
And finish it well.

1698
01:25:20,595 --> 01:25:23,587
Why did you tell him that
you could make it to the party?

1699
01:25:23,665 --> 01:25:26,532
Jugs, because there's one more
C left in my list - Which one?

1700
01:25:26,601 --> 01:25:29,195
Luv Nanda himself and
that damn BBC club of his.

1701
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:30,532
But how will you do this?

1702
01:25:33,074 --> 01:25:34,132
Okay.

1703
01:25:34,943 --> 01:25:36,604
We'll have to go to
Gollu's party first.

1704
01:25:36,945 --> 01:25:41,211
There l'll meet Luv and pretend
like everything is normal.

1705
01:25:41,282 --> 01:25:42,681
l'll take him to the camera room.

1706
01:25:42,751 --> 01:25:44,548
Right then, you get Karthikeyan

1707
01:25:44,619 --> 01:25:46,746
so that he can put that live
footage on the college website.

1708
01:25:47,288 --> 01:25:50,621
When all this is done, just
come back and knock on the door.

1709
01:25:50,692 --> 01:25:52,091
But, what will you do?

1710
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:54,628
Oh Jugs, you don't wanna know.

1711
01:25:54,696 --> 01:25:55,754
Yoohoo.

1712
01:25:55,830 --> 01:25:56,888
Hey, when is me being

1713
01:25:56,965 --> 01:25:59,229
a designer Mom gonna
help the three of you?

1714
01:25:59,567 --> 01:26:01,558
l'll style you in such a way that

1715
01:26:01,636 --> 01:26:04,696
he'll regret letting go of
such a hot thing like you.

1716
01:26:04,773 --> 01:26:05,831
You get it?

1717
01:26:05,907 --> 01:26:06,965
Girl power.

1718
01:26:07,041 --> 01:26:08,303
Girl power.

1719
01:26:08,576 --> 01:26:09,634
Huh!

1720
01:26:12,046 --> 01:26:13,707
Girls are so stupid.

1721
01:26:14,783 --> 01:26:16,648
lf a guy had done all this,

1722
01:26:17,652 --> 01:26:21,110
he would have never
left his bracelet with me.

1723
01:26:22,657 --> 01:26:23,715
Stupid.

1724
01:26:25,994 --> 01:26:29,987
Rhea, you messed with the wrong guy.

1725
01:26:30,064 --> 01:26:31,929
Rhea is just a Plain Jane.

1726
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,661
Never thought she'd get so psycho!

1727
01:26:33,735 --> 01:26:35,134
l mean, l just don't get it.

1728
01:26:35,737 --> 01:26:36,931
Why would she do this to you?

1729
01:26:37,605 --> 01:26:38,731
She's jealous, babes.

1730
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:42,332
l dumped her and picked you over her.

1731
01:26:43,077 --> 01:26:44,135
But don't worry about it.

1732
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:50,073
We'll celebrate her 18th birthday now.

1733
01:27:17,979 --> 01:27:19,037
Freddie Kapoor's playing tonight.

1734
01:27:19,113 --> 01:27:20,239
What do you expect is gonna happen?

1735
01:27:21,382 --> 01:27:23,646
The end of Luv.

1736
01:27:23,852 --> 01:27:24,910
Karthikeyan

1737
01:27:25,653 --> 01:27:26,711
What are you doing here?

1738
01:27:26,788 --> 01:27:27,846
Granny's run away from home.

1739
01:27:27,922 --> 01:27:28,980
You have to help me find her.

1740
01:27:29,057 --> 01:27:31,184
Please come. Please.
- l have to be at the party.

1741
01:27:31,259 --> 01:27:32,317
l need to help Rhea.

1742
01:27:32,393 --> 01:27:35,328
Okay, l'll tell
everyone that you like Jugs.

1743
01:27:36,397 --> 01:27:37,659
Can you spot her?

1744
01:27:37,732 --> 01:27:38,790
No.

1745
01:27:43,738 --> 01:27:46,002
What? Are you crazy?

1746
01:27:46,074 --> 01:27:47,735
But Natasha had promised.

1747
01:27:51,746 --> 01:27:52,804
Brother,

1748
01:27:53,348 --> 01:27:55,748
How could you even think like this?

1749
01:27:57,352 --> 01:27:58,819
You just called me brother?

1750
01:27:58,887 --> 01:27:59,945
Let's get outta here...

1751
01:28:00,021 --> 01:28:01,079
You called me the B-word?

1752
01:28:01,823 --> 01:28:03,814
Maya, Tara, Maya, Tara.

1753
01:28:15,036 --> 01:28:16,094
Look it's Luv Nanda...

1754
01:28:16,170 --> 01:28:18,035
Hey, look, Luv is here.
- Hey, show me your tattoo.

1755
01:28:22,777 --> 01:28:23,835
Hi, Luv.

1756
01:28:26,381 --> 01:28:28,713
Hey, Happy Birthday, baby.

1757
01:28:34,722 --> 01:28:36,451
l'm so thrilled that
you made it tonight.

1758
01:28:36,791 --> 01:28:37,849
l missed you.

1759
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:40,452
l missed you too.

1760
01:28:41,729 --> 01:28:42,855
ls everything okay?

1761
01:28:43,464 --> 01:28:44,726
What happened?

1762
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:46,458
Well

1763
01:28:47,468 --> 01:28:48,730
l had a rough night.

1764
01:28:49,337 --> 01:28:51,805
And, actually, you know what?

1765
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:54,071
l need to talk to you.

1766
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:03,808
Okay

1767
01:29:05,286 --> 01:29:08,744
but isn't it a little noisy in here?

1768
01:29:10,758 --> 01:29:12,487
Why don't we go someplace quiet?

1769
01:29:13,895 --> 01:29:14,953
Why not?

1770
01:29:16,364 --> 01:29:17,422
C'mon.

1771
01:29:17,498 --> 01:29:18,760
Let's go upstairs.

1772
01:29:21,369 --> 01:29:23,234
Quick, call Karthikeyan.

1773
01:29:23,304 --> 01:29:24,362
Right now.

1774
01:29:24,439 --> 01:29:25,497
Quick.

1775
01:29:28,443 --> 01:29:29,774
Hello?
- Where are you?

1776
01:29:29,911 --> 01:29:32,038
Rhea's Granny has run away from home.

1777
01:29:32,113 --> 01:29:33,171
What?

1778
01:29:33,247 --> 01:29:34,839
No, no, we found her now.

1779
01:29:35,984 --> 01:29:37,508
C'mon Granny, no.

1780
01:29:37,785 --> 01:29:39,377
Do you have your laptop on you or not?

1781
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:42,387
Of course, l always
have my laptop with me.

1782
01:29:42,457 --> 01:29:43,981
Then get here to Gollu's party.

1783
01:29:44,058 --> 01:29:45,116
l can't come.

1784
01:29:45,994 --> 01:29:47,461
Minty and Granny are with me.

1785
01:29:47,528 --> 01:29:48,790
Karthikeyan Ramachandran,

1786
01:29:48,863 --> 01:29:50,330
l don't care about anything.

1787
01:29:50,398 --> 01:29:51,922
Rhea has entered the room.

1788
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,264
And we have to broadcast her
live footage on these LCDS here.

1789
01:29:54,335 --> 01:29:55,393
NOW,

1790
01:29:55,803 --> 01:29:56,861
Moron.

1791
01:30:32,507 --> 01:30:35,499
l'm so sorry for being late, baby.

1792
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:40,842
But now

1793
01:30:41,449 --> 01:30:46,386
l wanna celebrate my birthday
just like it's supposed to be.

1794
01:30:54,328 --> 01:30:56,319
You're so hot,

1795
01:30:58,599 --> 01:30:59,861
And sexy.

1796
01:31:02,070 --> 01:31:04,538
Today, l'm gonna do stuff to you

1797
01:31:05,606 --> 01:31:08,939
That you'll never look
at any other girl every again.

1798
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:13,538
What?

1799
01:31:14,482 --> 01:31:19,078
l mean, you're just mine, right?

1800
01:31:21,289 --> 01:31:22,950
Why would you look at anyone else?

1801
01:31:23,958 --> 01:31:28,622
Tonight is going to be the
best night of your life.

1802
01:31:34,902 --> 01:31:35,960
Lie back.

1803
01:31:37,905 --> 01:31:40,897
Hey moron, stop hogging the road!

1804
01:31:48,983 --> 01:31:51,975
How about l tie you up?

1805
01:31:55,123 --> 01:31:58,388
And kiss you all over?

1806
01:32:01,195 --> 01:32:02,253
Ssh...

1807
01:32:08,202 --> 01:32:09,260
No

1808
01:32:14,408 --> 01:32:17,935
l'm gonna do the tying.

1809
01:32:24,552 --> 01:32:25,678
What did you think?

1810
01:32:28,156 --> 01:32:32,559
You'd do all that you did
and l wouldn't find out?

1811
01:32:42,036 --> 01:32:47,702
Rhea, people die to be with me.

1812
01:32:49,043 --> 01:32:50,101
And this,

1813
01:32:53,648 --> 01:32:56,515
This is how you repay me?

1814
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,714
Ouch, my nail.

1815
01:33:01,055 --> 01:33:03,649
Gollu, catch it on the website.

1816
01:33:03,724 --> 01:33:05,715
No live audience please.

1817
01:33:06,727 --> 01:33:08,456
Jugs, we need to help her. Right now.

1818
01:33:08,529 --> 01:33:09,723
She's in trouble
- Sonia

1819
01:33:10,198 --> 01:33:11,256
Breathe,

1820
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,058
Okay?

1821
01:33:14,135 --> 01:33:15,193
Now run.

1822
01:33:16,003 --> 01:33:17,197
My mom was always right.

1823
01:33:17,405 --> 01:33:20,340
Every girl wants to trap you.

1824
01:33:21,742 --> 01:33:23,073
Because l have everything.

1825
01:33:24,345 --> 01:33:25,403
The looks,

1826
01:33:26,547 --> 01:33:27,673
The money,

1827
01:33:29,016 --> 01:33:30,142
The charm,

1828
01:33:31,085 --> 01:33:32,552
The sex appeal,

1829
01:33:38,092 --> 01:33:39,150
But don't worry, Rhea,

1830
01:33:41,229 --> 01:33:42,287
l'm not gonna hurt you.

1831
01:33:42,363 --> 01:33:43,421
Oh no,

1832
01:33:43,631 --> 01:33:45,155
l've got more class than that.

1833
01:33:47,702 --> 01:33:49,363
What l'm gonna do with you

1834
01:33:49,437 --> 01:33:56,104
ls gonna be much much MUCH worse.

1835
01:33:57,645 --> 01:33:58,703
Screw you

1836
01:33:58,779 --> 01:34:00,713
Aww, my pleasure, baby.

1837
01:34:10,057 --> 01:34:11,115
What did you think Rhea?

1838
01:34:11,792 --> 01:34:13,054
That l won't win.

1839
01:34:13,127 --> 01:34:14,458
lf you do all this,

1840
01:34:15,096 --> 01:34:18,395
Rhea, you are the
grand prize of this game.

1841
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:23,058
A sweet virgin,

1842
01:34:23,271 --> 01:34:25,466
And when it gets
uploaded on our website,

1843
01:34:25,539 --> 01:34:29,669
And l'm gonna get 1,000 points,

1844
01:34:30,344 --> 01:34:34,542
And l'm gonna be this years'
Billionaire Boys' Club King.

1845
01:34:34,615 --> 01:34:35,673
Karthikeyan

1846
01:34:43,424 --> 01:34:47,690
l'm Luv Nanda,

1847
01:34:47,828 --> 01:34:50,422
And l never lose.

1848
01:34:50,831 --> 01:34:54,824
Luv, you always were and you
always will be a pathetic loser.

1849
01:34:55,436 --> 01:34:58,633
You know Rhea, Natasha was my Plan B.

1850
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,775
But you almost messed that up too.

1851
01:35:02,843 --> 01:35:04,105
Plan B?

1852
01:35:04,178 --> 01:35:06,112
l'm nobody's Plan B, you loser.

1853
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:07,374
l'm always Plan A.

1854
01:35:09,383 --> 01:35:10,850
Luv is so insensitive?

1855
01:35:11,786 --> 01:35:14,721
But Natasha, you will
always be my Plan A.

1856
01:35:15,790 --> 01:35:17,451
Don't you touch me, Luv.

1857
01:35:20,194 --> 01:35:24,187
l touched you,
l touched you, l touched you.

1858
01:35:24,265 --> 01:35:25,323
What are you gonna do?

1859
01:35:25,399 --> 01:35:26,798
She needs our help. Let's go.

1860
01:35:26,867 --> 01:35:30,325
To start with, l'm gonna get
my 1,000 points.

1861
01:35:30,871 --> 01:35:37,868
And then, l'm gonna
do what you did to me.

1862
01:35:39,613 --> 01:35:40,671
Your hair...

1863
01:35:41,215 --> 01:35:47,211
your clothes won't remain on you.

1864
01:35:49,357 --> 01:35:50,824
And your reputation?

1865
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:58,157
Your life, as you know
it is going to be over.

1866
01:36:01,635 --> 01:36:04,160
Gollu, l told you later.

1867
01:36:04,772 --> 01:36:06,569
We know what's exactly
happening in there, Luv.

1868
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:07,698
Open the door.

1869
01:36:07,908 --> 01:36:09,170
Rhea are you ok?

1870
01:36:11,445 --> 01:36:12,844
Jugs, we need to call the police.

1871
01:36:12,913 --> 01:36:14,175
Right now. Let's go.

1872
01:36:14,915 --> 01:36:18,248
Has anyone ever done
this to you, Luv Nanda?

1873
01:36:18,319 --> 01:36:20,253
Rhea, Rhea, my eyes.

1874
01:36:20,321 --> 01:36:23,256
Rhea, Rhea, Rhea.

1875
01:36:23,324 --> 01:36:24,382
What do you think?

1876
01:36:24,458 --> 01:36:27,188
You're gonna break my heart again?

1877
01:36:27,261 --> 01:36:28,922
That l'm gonna be scared?

1878
01:36:29,397 --> 01:36:31,262
That l'll go home right away?

1879
01:36:31,332 --> 01:36:32,390
Oh my eyes...

1880
01:36:32,466 --> 01:36:34,798
You know you are not
that important to me.

1881
01:36:35,936 --> 01:36:37,927
Do you know what's my biggest revenge?

1882
01:36:38,406 --> 01:36:40,806
That l'll forget you forever
after what happens tonight.

1883
01:36:40,875 --> 01:36:42,206
You bloody creep.

1884
01:36:42,276 --> 01:36:43,868
But you will remember me forever.

1885
01:36:45,946 --> 01:36:47,208
And you will realize
the consequences of

1886
01:36:47,281 --> 01:36:49,749
playing with a girl's trust
and her heart.

1887
01:36:49,817 --> 01:36:51,546
Just because we don't have them

1888
01:36:51,952 --> 01:36:53,886
doesn't mean we don't
know how to kick them.

1889
01:37:05,232 --> 01:37:10,295
Billionaires Boys' Club,
you are officially shut down.

1890
01:37:44,405 --> 01:37:46,805
Rhea, Rhea, Rhea.

1891
01:37:46,874 --> 01:37:49,468
Rhea, Rhea, Rhea.

1892
01:37:49,543 --> 01:37:52,478
Rhea, Rhea, Rhea.

1893
01:37:52,546 --> 01:37:53,604
Where's Luv?

1894
01:37:53,681 --> 01:37:55,672
Rhea, Rhea, Rhea.

1895
01:37:55,749 --> 01:37:57,410
Can you tell us what happened inside?

1896
01:37:57,485 --> 01:37:59,282
He's the real hero.

1897
01:37:59,353 --> 01:38:00,411
Speak to him.

1898
01:38:00,488 --> 01:38:03,286
Yes, yes, please tell
us what happened inside.

1899
01:38:04,959 --> 01:38:09,896
Rhea Dialdas, you were always
uncool and you will always be.

1900
01:38:10,631 --> 01:38:14,032
But what you did up
there was quite cool.

1901
01:38:15,503 --> 01:38:19,303
Just don't ever mess
with my car or me.

1902
01:38:19,907 --> 01:38:21,636
Then even God won't
be able to help you.

1903
01:38:22,643 --> 01:38:24,508
Take care girls, have fun.

1904
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:34,319

Jump up, sing and dance

No choice but to stay awake

01:41:34,234 --> 01:41:36,566
Granny, please get up, please.

1965
01:41:36,904 --> 01:41:39,168
Mom just messaged.
They're arriving home.

1966
01:41:39,239 --> 01:41:40,501
C'mon, we've got to run.

1967
01:41:40,574 --> 01:41:41,905
Ever since he was born,

1968
01:41:41,975 --> 01:41:43,909
he has been a pain in the
neck just like his father.

1969
01:41:43,977 --> 01:41:46,571
Always plays the party pooper.

1970
01:41:47,247 --> 01:41:49,579
This is fine, but
how will we get home?

1971
01:41:49,650 --> 01:41:52,517
There's no transport
available at his hour.

1972
01:41:52,586 --> 01:41:53,644
What do we do now?

1973
01:41:56,590 --> 01:41:57,716
You girls need a ride?

1974
01:42:07,534 --> 01:42:08,592
People are wrong

1975
01:42:08,669 --> 01:42:09,727
when they say Mumbai is a fast city.

1976
01:42:10,137 --> 01:42:11,195
There's no peace.

1977
01:42:11,271 --> 01:42:12,670
No one waits for another.

1978
01:42:12,873 --> 01:42:15,603
Look now, this is the real Mumbai.

1979
01:42:15,876 --> 01:42:17,070
The Mumbai l love.

1980
01:42:34,962 --> 01:42:36,020
Thank you.

1981
01:42:36,096 --> 01:42:39,156
Hey Rhea, do you
wanna hang out sometime?

1982
01:42:39,233 --> 01:42:40,825
We'll grab a coffee, watch a movie?

1983
01:42:41,835 --> 01:42:43,234
Really?
- Yeah.

1984
01:42:43,771 --> 01:42:45,762
Of course, call me.

1985
01:42:46,974 --> 01:42:48,032
Yes!

1986
01:42:50,310 --> 01:42:52,107
C'mon guys, c'mon.

1987
01:42:53,247 --> 01:42:54,305
C'mon, quickly.

1988
01:42:54,782 --> 01:42:55,840
Hurry up.

1989
01:42:58,318 --> 01:42:59,580
Jugs, where's the other shoe?

1990
01:43:01,321 --> 01:43:03,050
Guys, hurry up, they
must be here any time now.

1991
01:43:03,123 --> 01:43:04,181
Please, please.

1992
01:43:05,192 --> 01:43:06,250
Shoo shoo... stupid crow!

1993
01:43:13,333 --> 01:43:15,597
See, our little angels.

1994
01:43:17,137 --> 01:43:18,195
Come.

1995
01:43:27,948 --> 01:43:29,006
Thanks, guys,

1996
01:43:29,616 --> 01:43:31,880
