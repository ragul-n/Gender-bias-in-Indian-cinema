00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,320
'In this country,
dreams are sold on pamphlets.'

2
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,400
'Be it losing weight in a week,
or looking fairer.'

3
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,720
'But the country is
swept by a wave of madness'

4
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,640
'when enrolments begin for Engineerin
Medical and Management courses.'

5
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,160
'These enrolments guarantee fancy car
flashy suits, and hefty salaries.'

6
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,200
'These dreams are seen by parents,
but fulfilled by their children.'

7
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,840
'It's one big circus'

8
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,080
'and 'I' am its Ring-master.'

9
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,456
'And I mean it when I say that
many have been dancing to my tunes.'

10
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,920
'But this one is special.'

11
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,640
'Trapped in the quagmire
of his father's dreams.'

12
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,960
'This is Sattu.'

13
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,720
'Aka Satyendra Dubey.'

14
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,040
For four years, he's been in Kota
the hub of India's education factory

15
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,120
'serving a rigorous life-sentence
in its coaching mines.'

16
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,240
'Sattu's father, Yogesh,
has nestled him'

17
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,376
'in a rented apartment
with the necessary amenities.'

18
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,040
'And his phone has enough balance jus
to receive calls from his father..'

19
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,120
'or his elder sister, Nupur.'

20
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,360
'Sattu's landlord
is his local guardian.'

21
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,800
'He ensures that Sattu doesn't have
to step out even to buy a toothpaste.

22
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,960
'For this, he charges Sattu's
father an additional Rs. 1000.'

23
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,680
'But this is no laughing matter.'

24
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,600
'Going out to buy even toothpaste
can waste 10 precious minutes..'

25
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,720
in which Sattu can easily
solve three Calculus equations.'

26
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,920
'All these saved minutes, days
spent in solving Calculus problems..'

27
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,280
'and the months and years, are
all taking Sattu towards the moment..

'When his exile in Kota will end and
he will appear for the Entrance Exams.

31
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,960
Stop here.

32
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,920
10 rupees more.

33
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,320
I'll take that.
How much from the station till here.

34
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,720
Leave.

35
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,680
Bless you.

36
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,200
All good?

37
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,280
Mom.

38
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,536
The poor chicken had to
be martyred because of you today.

39
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,120
Why? Aren't you going to eat?

40
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,920
Did you have a change of heart?

41
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
Mum, did she cook it?

42
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,760
You wish!
She's only good for making small talk.

43
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,360
She's afraid of breaking
a nail while cooking.

44
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,040
Are you planning to feed
your husband only frozen food?

45
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,920
Not again.
Remember what we agreed on?

46
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,320
No discussion about marriage
before I don't graduate.

47
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,960
But you never listen.

48
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,160
It's not easy to find a suitable groo.

49
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,520
Even if I start now, won't take me
less than 2 years to find one. Satt.

50
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,600
Mother, did you have your tea?

51
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,400
Hey, hero!

52
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,840
Hello, grandma.

53
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,320
- Hello, uncle.
- Hello.

54
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,160
Dad, can I...

55
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,200
Yeah go, we'll continue this
conversation over evening tea.

56
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,080
- Come on...
- Let's go.

57
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,160
Yogesh, you're eating
chicken on a Tuesday?

58
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,360
My son has returned home from Kota.

59
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,000
Once he secures an Engineering seat..

60
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,760
I guarantee a special
treat for everyone.

61
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,440
From Nafeel.

62
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,840
Sattu. Sattu.

63
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
Drink this.

64
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,240
Stir it well.

65
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,960
You always leave the
powder at the bottom.

66
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,336
'Just like the legendary Abhimanyu
who broke through the quagmire...'

67
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,240
'Sattu is under pressure to crack
his engineering entrance exam today.'

68
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,200
'The next three hours will decide'

69
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,560
'whether his years of hard work
and effort were in vain or fruitful.'

70
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,800
Walk carefully.

71
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,400
Five minutes to go. Do a quick revisi.

72
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,280
Look, the bell has rung.

73
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
All the best!

74
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,160
Bless you.

75
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,040
What happened to you?

76
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
Nothing.

77
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,200
Tried committing suicide
just to escape studying.

78
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,080
- Silence.
- Then?

79
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,320
Then what?

80
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,280
His father's a jerk.

81
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,560
Got him fixed up and
brought him here for the exam.

82
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,200
No one will make any noise please.

83
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,840
How was the exam, son?
It was okay.

84
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,040
Will you pass?

85
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,040
We'll see.

86
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,816
Would you rather see
the sole of my shoe instead?

87
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,120
Dad, two questions in Physics
were out of the syllabus.

88
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,200
Everyone outside was
discussing the same thing.

89
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,520
You have to clear the exam.

90
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,920
Dad, this isn't the only
Engineering Institute in India.

91
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,400
There are many others.

92
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,680
Why do you always
make a fuss about this?

93
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,320
- Come freshen up.
- Listen..

94
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,560
This 'fuss' is how I raised you,
my dear.

95
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,400
And this is how I
paid for your education.

96
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,800
It's how I afford a square meal.

97
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,960
This man who creates a 'fuss'
is not your enemy, he's your father.

98
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,120
Running a family is not easy.

99
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,720
Money is the key here.

100
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,840
We don't hail from a wealthy family.

101
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,736
When I come home every day,
earning a buck by hook or crook..

102
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,280
You never say that
I am making a 'fuss'.

103
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,800
Did you ever ask?

104
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,800
Did you?

105
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,320
And I am making a fuss, eh!

106
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,280
You always fall sick when we need you.

107
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,960
- No...
- Just go.

108
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,080
No one's ever died of a little fever.
My body is hurting.

109
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,480
Listen. Do you know anyone else out there?
No.

110
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,480
Let me speak to him.

111
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,456
Why would anyone go so early
to check the results?

112
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,480
Nonsense.

113
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
What happened?

114
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
Nothing.

115
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,960
You know dad can't wait.

116
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,320
He's had his fourth
cup of tea since morning.

117
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,480
And hasn't even been
to the washroom yet.

118
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,320
He sent brother Sonu all the
way to Kanpur to check my results.

119
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,520
But Sonu couldn't
go because he fell sick.

120
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,280
It's a matter of one day.

121
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,096
The result would've been
declared in the news paper anyway.

122
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,240
One day, huh.

123
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,560
How are you so calm?

124
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,840
Aren't you stressed?

125
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,120
I think I didn't make it.

126
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,760
Till date, dad has spent
Rs. 575,000 on me.

127
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,480
Even if I commit suicide, dad will
recover that money from my dead body!

128
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,840
Do you want a slap?

129
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,320
Stop worrying about money.

130
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,840
Are you worried about my dowry?

131
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
Don't be.

132
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,280
Stupid.

133
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,480
So you're planning to elope and marry.

134
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,960
That's not a bad idea, Sattu.

135
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,240
Think about dad.

136
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,496
He won't have to spend
a fat amount on my wedding.

137
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,880
And people won't get a chance
to dislike the food behind his back.

138
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
Nice.

139
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,960
And.. For this idea,
I'll give you a treat.

140
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Treat.

141
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,240
Learn to make flatbreads first!

142
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,600
2..33..50..68.

143
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
Yeah..

144
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,960
Thank you! Thank you very much!

145
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,760
My son's been selected, sir!

146
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,040
Call Nafeel for the biryani.
Of course, sir! Of course!

147
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,640
Where are you?

148
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,360
What happened?
Wait, I'll tell you.

149
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,240
Sattu did it!

150
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,560
I just found out.

151
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,080
Mom, you can forget
about your diabetes today.

152
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,960
Brother Sattu, you did it.

153
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,440
Brother Sattu. Brother Sattu.

154
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,800
Brother Sattu, you did it.

155
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,560
Sattu, you were fantastic.

156
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,080
Brother Sattu. Brother Sattu.

157
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,080
Can you hear the hullabaloo, brother?

158
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,400
It's confirmed. It's him.

159
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,760
You're the pride of Jaunpur.

160
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,200
- He hung up.
- Hung up.

161
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,760
I hung up, Brother won't hang up.

162
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,000
Now pay up.

163
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,360
Rs. 5,100 for the achiever.
Take a picture.

164
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,520
And a sewing machine for the daughter.

165
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,040
Take a picture.

166
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,640
Mixer-grinder for the sister-in-law.

167
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,840
Brother Sattu.

168
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,600
Listen, you guys need
to move to the row below.

169
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,760
But we've bought
tickets for these seats.

170
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
Look.

171
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,120
Are you high? Or are you blind?

172
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,000
Haven't you seen his
posters around the city?

173
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,360
This is Babban.

174
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,320
No, no, he's just got
admission in Engineering.

175
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,536
And he hasn't watched a single
film for years, so he's excited.

176
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,560
Is that what all
the excitement is about?

177
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,240
My father got into Parliament.

178
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,280
Do you expect me to dive
into the screen and hug Bobby Deol?

179
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,440
Get up.

180
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,560
Get up!

181
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,000
Hey. The children were
smart enough to understand.

182
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,040
Do you need a separate invitation?

183
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,880
I am not getting up from this seat.

184
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,040
I learned that from your father,
the Politician.

185
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,880
Let the children watch the film.

186
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,920
They will vote for
you when they grow up.

187
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,920
Are you taking us for granted?

188
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,040
It will be curtains for you
even before the titles start rolling.

189
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,120
- Let's go from here.
- Wait...

190
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,960
Please enjoy the film.

191
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,520
Shukla!

192
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,360
- Go up there.
- Yes. I'll check.

193
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,800
13 and 14 are our seats.

194
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,920
Sorry.

195
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,520
Please come.

196
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,840
Come on, we'll continue this
show in the Police Station now.

197
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,360
Enjoy the film.

198
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,560
And by the way, Kajol is the murderer.

199
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,320
Come on.

200
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,360
Thank you, sir.

201
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,960
So how was the celebration yesterday?

202
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,920
Don't ask, sister.

203
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,440
You won't believe what happened yesterday.
Why?

204
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,040
He really beat the
crap out of those goons.

205
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,960
And they were not some ordinary goons.

206
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,000
They had guns.

207
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,760
But the guy was full of confidence.

208
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,080
Hope he wasn't a goon himself.

209
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,160
No, you didn't hear him speak, sister.

210
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,080
And, what if he hadn't shown up?
God..

211
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,616
You shouldn't be going to such places.

212
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,600
Now don't talk like mom.

213
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,400
So what about your
post-graduation plans?

214
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,400
Leave it.

215
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,840
I am trying to forget about it.
Don't remind me please.

216
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,160
Give me a hand here.

217
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,480
Sattu!

218
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,720
Hey, that's the same guy.
Hold this.

219
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,960
- What happened?
- Hold this.

220
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,280
At least lend me a hand...

221
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,080
Take it.

222
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,800
Thank you brother.

223
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,800
Come, let's get something to eat.

224
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,400
So what rank did you score?

225
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,440
287.

226
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,440
And thank you for yesterday.

227
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,240
Forget it.

228
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,360
There's no sorry and
thank you amongst friends.

229
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,160
287?

230
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,880
You nailed it, didn't you?

231
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:44,280
Mr. Agarwal's son in Shashtri Nagar
cleared the medical entrance exam..

232
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,960
For which he got
his son a 156cc motorcycle.

233
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,560
But you deserve a helicopter!

234
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Can you fly one?

235
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,720
287!

236
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,520
I see.

237
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,960
How many hours did you study?

238
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,720
Well.

239
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,600
5 hours of sleep.

240
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,000
6 hours in classes..

241
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,520
1 hour for miscellaneous
stuff and 12 hours of self-study.

242
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,040
Which coaching center?

243
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,120
B.K. Agarwal, brother.

244
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,600
The one on Singhura Road.

245
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,560
Near the Confectionery shop.

246
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,880
What's the owner's name?

247
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,240
- Madan Chauhan?
- Yes.

248
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,760
That bloody, he must have
robbed your father of a heavy sum.

249
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,600
- What does he do?
- Service.

250
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,920
I see.

251
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,200
Any side income or is
he struggling with his debts?

252
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,640
Actually, he had to
borrow a pretty big sum.

253
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,800
What are his plans to repay the money.

254
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,280
I guess that comes
after your placement, huh?

255
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,080
Son, it's clearly visible on your fac.

256
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,760
The responsibility.

257
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,040
Who else is in the family?

258
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,240
An older sister.
Old enough to get married.

259
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,280
My mother, who's keeping sick.

260
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,600
I just want to make it in life, broth.

261
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,600
Getting emotional?

262
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,400
Need a handkerchief?

263
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,840
You have a long way
to go before you make it.

264
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,840
But your family must
be under tremendous pressure.

265
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,520
I have a couple of options
for people like you.

266
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,880
I've helped boys like you before.

267
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,480
You...

268
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,200
Any intentions of appearing
for Regional or local entrance exams?

269
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,320
Your mind must be fresh.

270
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,760
Will you appear for them?

271
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,600
Now there's no need for that, brother.

272
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,080
Need.

273
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,680
Human needs are endless!

274
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,200
Opportunities come to an end.

275
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,440
Dreams come to an end.

276
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,440
Even bloody life comes to an end.

277
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,520
But 'needs' never end.

278
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,880
Well anyway, I thought
you can easily earn Rs. 50,000.

279
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,560
But let it be.

280
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,400
Brother, what does one get
50 million for?

281
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
Forget it.

282
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,120
You enjoy your vacation, young chap.

283
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,720
If you need help, call me.

284
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,600
My name is Rakesh Singh.

285
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,160
Rocky.

286
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,240
And if you run into any spoilt kid of
a politician next time,

287
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,720
just take my name.

288
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,720
Everything will be fine.

289
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,696
After breaking the Provident Fund,
Rs. 0.6 million to Rs. 0.7 million

290
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,296
can be arranged from which the demand
of the groom's family can be fulfille.

291
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,656
But Sattu's tuition
fee will still remain!

292
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,760
Right.

293
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
Hello, son.

294
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
Sit. Sit.

295
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,440
Take these divine offerings from
the temple of Kanthenath.

296
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,440
Surely you can take these!

297
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,840
Or have you forgotten God after
clearing your Engineering Exam?

298
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,040
Go on.

299
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,136
Why were you sounding like
an old scooter on the phone?

300
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,960
Yes, sir! Coming.

301
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,760
Brother, yesterday you
said I could earn money..

302
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,720
And I thought that
even I can make some money.

303
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,200
Of course, you can.

304
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,440
Anything is possible
if you put your heart in it.

305
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,840
How?

306
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,600
Have you ever looked
around in the exam hall?

307
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,880
Ever wondered how many
kids in there are just blank.

308
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,400
Was everyone in Kota as smart as you?

309
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,440
No, but they worked hard.

310
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,640
Yes. There were a couple
of guys who didn't study at all.

311
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,120
There are many who
rub the Engineering Lamp.

312
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,680
But the genie only
comes out for Aladdin!

313
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,320
There are millions of candidates.

314
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,840
And how many seats?

315
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,920
Around 10,000.

316
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,800
And, what about those
trying for regional, or local..

317
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,640
Or anything they
can get their hands on.

318
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,920
Very less. Hard to say.

319
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Exactly.

320
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,440
I help such people.

321
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,640
Now, if someone answers
the exam for these kids

322
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,280
on their behalf...

323
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Won't that be great?

324
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,680
You mean someone else writes the
paper instead of the actual candidate.

325
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,240
How?

326
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,440
Look, son.

327
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,280
Let them dip into your knowledge..

328
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,800
And you dip into
their pool of wealth.

329
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,120
Father's debts, sister's marriage
are all trivial.

330
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,080
The point is...

331
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,360
You're smart, I know.

332
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,280
But can you be smart in copying?

333
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,360
I see a 7-figure salary
on your face in the future.

334
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
That's nice.

335
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,960
You'll definitely get a job,
but after four years.

336
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,120
I am saying this only because you sai
your family's going through a tough t.

337
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
Look.

338
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,520
I know you won't get into vices like
buying a motorcycle or other debauche.

339
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,480
But you will have a girlfriend,
won't you?

340
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,080
Wouldn't you want to take her out?

341
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,040
Have you heard about
Newton's Fourth Law?

342
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,880
No one loves a poor man.

343
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,600
Understood?

344
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,120
Congratulations, sir.

345
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,200
Thank you.

346
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,896
I am from Gyaan Bhandaar
Coaching Centre.

347
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,240
There's still considerable
time before you join college.

348
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,840
You must have spare time.

349
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,480
If you can give some guidance
in the evenings on Physics and Math.

350
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,080
Our regional exams are coming up.

351
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,840
Only two hours in the evening,
four days a week.

352
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,016
We're prepared to pay
you as much as Rs. 15,000.

353
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,760
I thought you'll easily earn 50,000.'

354
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,560
You're smart, I know!

355
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,120
But can you be smart in copying?

356
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,680
So Sattu, what have you decided?

357
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,320
You should do it, Sattu.

358
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,920
It's not a bad offer.

359
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,480
There's no harm in putting
your knowledge to good use.

360
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,040
And even I'll be relieved
that my son's lending me a hand.

361
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,920
But dad, I just received
another offer today.

362
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,960
And I wanted to discuss with you.

363
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
Who?

364
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,200
Who else did you talk to?

365
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,440
Who gave you an offer?

366
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,200
Good morning sir. Good morning.

367
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,640
Good morning sir. Good morning.

368
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,360
You do know tobacco causes cancer,
don't you?

369
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,360
Then double your quota
from tomorrow and die early!

370
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,280
You do look like you have a death wis.

371
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,576
Unless you don't show your
colourful mouth to the client

372
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,120
it doesn't prove you're a star, does.

373
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,000
- Hello.
- Hello sir.

374
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,216
Did your father accompany you?
Yes.

375
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,240
Very good.

376
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,840
You think it's funny.

377
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,560
Get going.

378
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,600
So you are Rakesh Singh?

379
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,160
I am Rakesh Singh ji.

380
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
Here.

381
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,400
From the Bengali Kali Bari Temple.

382
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,480
You too.

383
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,400
No wonder you found one so soon.

384
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,520
It's God's grace I tell you.

385
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,960
And your good wishes.

386
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,080
God listens to wishes,
but I take only cash.

387
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,400
So tell me, is he okay.

388
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,120
Or a dunce, like my son.

389
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,120
Well, he cracked the entrance
exam at first attempt.

390
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,360
I'll be surprised when your
son won't make it to the Top 10.

391
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,560
Really!

392
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,840
What are you saying?

393
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,120
Is that even possible?

394
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,600
Your son's just like you, Mr. Yadav.

395
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,960
And that's possible.

396
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,640
But you must have heard...

397
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,080
Stand up!
That teachers ask questions in the class.

398
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,640
Smart kids are called up to the
board to solve equations. Not you.

399
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,200
I just hope your son
doesn't embarrass you.

400
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,080
It's a plethora of problems, Mr. Yada.

401
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,880
Your son is a bloody...

402
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,600
Did you spit out your tobacco?

403
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,120
- Here you go.
- No.

404
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
Just half the amount now.

405
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,480
And the rest when the
results are declared.

406
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,960
Along with a box of sweets.

407
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,360
Here starts Sattu's journey
of answering exams for others.

408
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,440
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> You are so successful. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

414
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:50,400
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> Yes, you are accountable

415
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,720
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> You are so successful. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

416
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,720
- Bye.
- Bye.

417
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,760
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> You are like a rising star. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>
Is it for me?

418
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,560
- Wow!
- How?

419
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,176
Where are you getting the money from?
Bye.

420
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,680
Look.
He's become the star of Kota.

421
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,120
I've always had my eye on him.

422
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,696
The coaching center students
have become his fans.

423
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,800
Hello, aunty. How are you?

424
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,720
- I am fine. How are you?
- Offerings for you.

425
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,600
- All okay?
- Yes.

426
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,456
By the way,
what's the current rate these days?

427
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,680
The Tutorials in Patna offer
up to a million to rank holders.

428
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,160
What for?

429
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,200
You mean you didn't get anything?

430
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,480
Advertisement, uncle.

431
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,536
Flashing pictures of achievers guaran
business growth for coaching classes.

432
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,600
It's business. Everyone's doing it.

433
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,800
Do you have a passport-size
photo of Sattu?

434
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,160
Oh, yes, I do.
Shall I get it now?

435
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,640
Write your exams properly, okay.

436
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,360
- Do you want to pass?
- Yes.

437
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,960
- We can help.
- How?

438
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,560
- Go with him.
- I'll note down the details.

439
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,520
Would you prefer Mechanical or Chemic.

440
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,640
- Ravi Arya.
- Yes, sir.

441
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,400
- Kamal Rakshit.
- Yes, sir.

442
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,120
- Tanuj Garg.
- Yes, sir.

443
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,160
Congratulations.
All of you shift to the front row.

444
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,640
Like a gentleman.

445
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,240
- And Champak Tiwari.
- Yes, sir.

446
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,720
- Sayyed Abbas.
- Yes, sir.

447
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,520
- Raghu Sharma.
- Yes, sir.

448
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,120
Please sit on the last bench.

449
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,960
You have performed very poorly.

450
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,240
Last row, flop stars!

451
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,120
Front row, superstars!

452
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,720
Don't worry about the last bench.

453
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,480
- I guarantee you we'll make him pass.
- No, I don't want.

454
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,736
What's the point of wasting your mone
We'll help him pass directly.

455
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,400
- No, I don't want it.
- But listen..

456
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,520
I am sure you're willing
to spend at least Rs. 0.5 million.

457
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,440
How much did he score in Class 10?

458
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
78%.

459
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,520
And frankly,
the future doesn't look too bright.

460
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,400
But I can guarantee
you an engineering seat.

461
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,600
Without wasting a penny.

462
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,440
Even if he does get selected, what th.

463
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,680
Now you're sounding like a novice,
Mr. Tiwari.

464
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,120
Till today, 15 of my boys
are in different college campuses.

465
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,120
They will be your son's seniors.

466
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,160
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> He stayed up all night to work hard. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

467
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,320
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> Let things take its course. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>
You seem to be engrossed in studies.

468
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,800
From studies to ragging to placements
they will handle everything for your.

469
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,360
Life will soar...

470
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,040
Through the skies on autopilot.

471
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,680
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> You'll go for tuitions in a car. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

472
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,920
If you're guaranteeing
me an engineering seat

473
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,696
then I am prepared to
pay you even Rs. 1.5 million.

474
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,640
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> You just make money. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

475
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,520
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> This is not your cup of tea. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

476
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,800
If tomorrow I run away with your mone.

477
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,480
You tell a couple of
people about it and make a mess.

478
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,320
Name.

479
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,480
Rocky.

480
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,800
Balboa?

481
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,520
He guaranteed you an engineering
seat and you believed him.

482
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,560
Any kind of slip?

483
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,080
Maybe a cheque number?

484
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,280
No. It was all in cash.

485
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,880
Then do you want me to
register a case for heartbreak?

486
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,776
Well, he did promise
my son an engineering seat.

487
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,360
It's definitely a case of cheating.

488
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,200
If we start registering complaints
about breaking promises,

489
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,080
then we'll have to arrest Politicians
Romeos and Godmen.

490
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,520
Leave.

491
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,040
But why get into all that mess?

492
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,056
We're happy with what we're doing..

493
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,240
And you should be happy
being called an Engineer's dad.

494
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,680
It's a business of human capital.

495
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,120
These Einsteins are our human capital.

496
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,360
Just like one state buys
excess power from another state..

497
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,960
To diminish its darkness.

498
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,800
I use my Einsteins' excess knowledge.

499
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,320
For spreading knowledge
whenever required.

500
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,840
- Thank you.
- Bye.

501
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,840
Hello.

502
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,880
Bye.

503
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,880
Listen.

504
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,200
Why don't you organize a family
trip for me instead of my commission?

505
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,640
My wife's keen to see Europe.

506
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,960
Yeah, Yeah, that's fine.

507
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,320
Another one of your last
benchers was supposed to come.

508
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,240
Well, he died!

509
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,120
It was in the newspapers as well.

510
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,760
He hung himself from the fan.

511
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,760
You shouldn't make these
meek children sit on the last bench.

512
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,840
So now?

513
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,960
Now what?

514
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,200
The same old. A routine inquiry.

515
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,320
The demand for suicide-proof
fans will go up.

516
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,920
A handful of people
will make some extra bucks.

517
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,360
You know what.

518
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,440
Even if we put an.

"Injurious to Health" quote
at the entrance of our Coaching Centr

520
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,120
kids won't stop keep queuing up.

521
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,936
And yes, I've made arrangements
for those banking kids you'd asked fo.

522
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,160
Just meet them once.

523
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,840
You guys are having a ball!

524
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,696
And Rakesh sir,
you're giving him too much credit.

525
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,520
Not at all.

526
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,440
Of course, you are.

527
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,920
Mom and dad think they've
given birth to gold.

528
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,680
And you're just driving him up a tree

529
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,136
- I should eat something too.
- Nupur.

530
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,720
- Shall we go?
- Yes. Come on, Sattu.

531
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,840
But...

532
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,280

543
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,360
Now listen carefully.

544
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,760
There's a banking exam coming up.

545
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,120
What are they paying?

546
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,400
Bravo son,
straight to the point like a bullet.

547
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,976
You'll be paid just fine,
since this one's an outstation gig.

548
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,920
You might have to stay overnight.

549
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,360
Eat all you want.

550
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,240
And the ladies are stunners too!

00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,720

554
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,440
Good night, brother.

555
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,040
Come, sister, let's go.

556
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:01,120
Well, Sattu will be leaving
next month, but you must visit us.

557
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,040
I often go to Kanpur,
so I'll keep checking on him.

558
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:11,360
And, I'll have to come back for
your stale fritters and tasteless tea.

559
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,080
If you keep coming over,
the tea will keep getting better.

560
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,680
I am not stupid.

561
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,240
I often travel for business.

562
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,640
And now I'm even getting to know you.

563
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,880
We'll stay in touch.

564
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,600
- Good night.
- Good night.

565
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,880
Are you dead? Get up.

566
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,680
Brother, please amp
up the air-conditioning.

567
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,800
Rich kids enjoy themselves in college.

568
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,600
The middle-class is still worried..

569
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,720
Because their success is judged
by a distinction on the mark-sheets.

570
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,920
Wait a minute.

571
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
It's Rakesh sir.

572
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,520
- Hello.
- That's Shashi.

573
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,520
Let him know if you need anything.

574
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,360
Understood?

575
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,000
Okay. Enjoy.

576
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,560
Poor Sattu

577
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:53,800
had the additional responsibility
of appearing for others.

578
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:59,080
After all, he had tasted blood;
The blood called 'big bucks.'

579
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,400
What are you looking at?

580
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,400
Show me. Show me too!

581
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,360
- Hello dad.
- Hello, Sattu.

582
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,936
- Please give Nupur the phone.
- Wait, I'll give her the phone.

583
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,680
How are you, Sattu?

584
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,560
- Hello, sent your birthday gift.
- Okay!

585
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,120
Take a look, daughter.

586
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,440
Not again.
I don't want to get married now.

587
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,600
Should I order juice for you?

588
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,080
Have this sweets.

589
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,120
Have it, please.
It is very special.

590
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,040
Listen, you're going to Kolkata now,
You'll be earning double.

591
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,040
- Brother.
- Yes.

592
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,920
Have you made the necessary
arrangements for Sattu's Kolkata trip.

593
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,880
You know what,
let's move to America instead.

594
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,360
The trains here are too noisy.

595
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,760
Doesn't matter where I am.

596
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,280
But dad won't rest until
he doesn't make me slog to death.

597
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,440
I wonder what was so important
before the Musical Nite!

598
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,560
I was hoping to finalize
a couple of deals here.

599
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,880
You've always underestimated me.

600
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,480
I would've taken care of everything.

601
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,800
Of course.

602
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,960
But you must first fix
the problem you created..

603
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,880
By sending that text
to the Nainital uncle's daughter.

604
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,536
You mean the one where I spelt
'love' with a 'w' instead of a 'v'?

605
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
Silly mistake.

606
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,040
Uncle shouldn't have fed
you so much of this boosting tonic.

607
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,200
You could barely play a game of kabad.

608
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,280
But you're all ready to be a father!

609
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,280
Brother, can I say something?

610
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,000
- Yes tell me.
- But only if you don't get angry?

611
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,760
Well, I can't guarantee that.

612
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,440
I'll say it anyway.

613
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,320
I think you should have
a word with Sattu's sister.

614
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,320
She's a girl, not some job or busines.

615
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,496
Do you want me to send
her lovey-dovey text messages?

616
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,880
No.

617
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,600
You should tell her
that you're not single.

618
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,840
Or at least put a picture
of my sister-in-law on your phone.

619
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,160
So that she doesn't get shocked...

620
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,480
Why don't I place your
dead picture on my phone instead?

621
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,760
Idiot! I'm just saying..

622
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,400
Hello, father.

623
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,840
Why didn't you just catch a flight?

624
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,520
Now you won't make it
to Jhansi before tomorrow.

625
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,560
Sameer's flight will land
in Gwalior in the morning.

626
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,280
I've already arranged for a car.

627
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,320
And also sent him the driver's number.

628
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,600
Fine, fine.

629
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,680
But your brother and sister-in-law ar
coming over for your sister's wedding.

630
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,256
It's important for someone from the
family to be present to receive them.

631
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,240
I wonder when you'll
understand social etiquette.

632
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,920
I'll take a look.

633
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,920
- Brother!
- How are you?

634
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,056
- What took you so long?
- How is everything?

635
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,800
- Everything is just fine.
- Chandu!

636
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,736
- Sister-in-law.
- The guests will be arriving soon.

637
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,680
Brother, what did you get me?

638
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,760
Bless you.

639
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,920
The train was delayed by
two hours, wasn't it? Yes.

640
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,920
Fine. Go on.

641
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,016
- Don't follow your father's footsteps.
- God bless you.

642
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,120
- Did you get a mixie for me?
- Yes, it's in the car.

643
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,816
- Look at that stubble.
- Get the luggage from the car.

644
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,720
Have you eaten? You haven't.

645
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,360
Sit. Chutki!

646
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,600
See.

647
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,680
Now you look like a hero.

648
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,680
- Can I take the pictures of you?
- They are taking a picture.

649
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,280
Brother Sameer!

650
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,520
Brother Sameer is here!

651
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,080
Come, son.

652
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,080
How are you?

653
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,440
- How are you, son?
- Bless you.

654
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,040
Hi.

655
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,760
So good to see you.

656
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,160
Nice to see you.

657
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,360
Hey!

658
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,560
- Lovely to see you, dear.
- How are you?

659
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,200
- Come on.
- How have you been?

660
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,480
I hope you had a pleasant journey.

661
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,720
How are you?

662
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,840
Good.

663
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,840
Papa is always praising you.

664
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,440
He is very hard worker.

665
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,680
They have had a long journey.

666
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,720
He has made our family proud.

667
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,720
He's the one,
he adds so much glory to our family.

668
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,600
- There. There. Yes.
- How long will it take?

669
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,720
Sameer is exceptionally brilliant.

670
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,760
He was a state rank holder.

671
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,200
- Hello.
- As is Rakesh.

672
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,320
Rakesh was never interested in studyi.

673
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,520
Entrance exams must be difficult too.

674
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,760
Roopali's daughter
tried thrice apparently.

675
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,960
Sir, uncle clearly asked for pink
lights to go with the marigold flower.

676
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,856
Where in the world will I put this
up now? What am I going to do with th.

677
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,720
Shove it in your mouth!

678
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,280
Just put them up where dad asked you.

679
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,800
- Don't ask silly questions.
- Okay.

680
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,600
It was clearly my fault.

681
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,960
It's not an easy job to become a doct.

682
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,720
Business has picked up pace.
But let's see..

683
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,880
Running Coaching Centres
is hardly a profession.

684
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,360
Sameer is a surgeon at John Hopkins.

685
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,200
He charges a huge fee
for extracting a single tooth.

686
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,640
Yes, dad. But that's now.

687
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,936
All this while, it's been brother
Rakesh who paid for our wedding..

688
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,480
And now even Chutki's.

689
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,640
And he's been looking
after the entire family too.

690
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,920
Bablu, come here! Coming.

691
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,560
What's wrong?
Why do you look so stressed?

692
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,800
It's just the work getting to me.

693
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,880
Do you need anything else?

694
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,000
Will I get what I want?

695
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,320
Why? Did I forget something?

696
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,960
There's your glass of water, milk,

697
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,480
your undergarments, mosquito cream.

698
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,320
No, it's all right.

699
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,840
So... Have you been well?

700
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,440
I hope you didn't run into
any problems when I wasn't here.

701
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,760
Well, Savitri didn't
show up for two whole weeks..

702
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,200
So I had more chores on my hand.

703
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,856
But she hardly does any
work even when she's here.

704
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,176
I've to literally stand on
her head and give her instructions.

705
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,840
The amount of oil she uses for cookin
someone's definitely going to fall si.

706
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,200
But I bought her a can
of butter and clearly told her..

707
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,440
That this should last an entire month
or else she will be in big trouble.

708
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,520
I also visited my mom.

709
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,720
Everyone was asking about you.

710
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,760
My elder sister-in-law
fractured her leg.

711
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,040
So now she's on bed rest.

712
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,520
And you know what? My brother
installed a bell next to her bed.

713
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,016
Whenever she needs anything,
all she does is ring the bell..

714
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,480
And someone's there to help her out.

715
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,920
She's become static.

716
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,600
And was advising me to go out.

717
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,560
I told her she must be crazy.
Who wants to go out in this weather?

718
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,440
Yes..

719
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,760
The cops raided the hotel.
But it's all settled now.

720
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,120
What happened?

721
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,760
Nothing, it was a raid
and they took him in as well.

722
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,616
I tried calling you,
but you didn't answer.

723
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,280
But then Sattu called Bablu.

724
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,920
How much did they settle for?

725
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,400
Around Rs. 10,000.

726
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,200
Give the phone to him.

727
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,760
Brother on the line.

728
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,400
Hello. I've been to jail many times.

729
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,040
Once one of my candidates got arreste.

730
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:50,080
And while trying to free him,
I got slapped by the constable.

731
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,040
But you said I wouldn't get caught.

732
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,880
This was not an arrest, son.

733
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,840
Listen, there's a local tradition her.

734
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,560
Dial 100 to call the cops
and pay 100 to drive them away.

735
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,560
Understand.

736
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,880
I'll hang up now.

737
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,880
Come on, don't worry.
Time for your exams.

738
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,720
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong?

739
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,760
I was on the telephone all night,
and my eardrums are exploding.

740
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,000
I haven't had the chance
to even visit the washroom.

741
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,656
And this place is filled
with a bunch of idiots.

742
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,200
No one knows how to make coffee.

743
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,600
They gave me turmeric milk,
and now my insides are burning.

744
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,840
I am going to nap now.

745
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,576
And then see you in the
evening when I've freshened up.

746
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,840
- Why?
- Why!

747
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,600
After long, I'll hear you
sing instead of mouthing expletives.

748
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,640
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> So what if we parted ways. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

759
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,960
- Hello.
- Please sit.

760
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,600
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

761
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,480
- No need for this.
- Come sit here.

762
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,160

773
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,680
The real deal is about fees.

774
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,080
And even parents only
care about the degree.

775
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,360
We need an empty plot of land.

776
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,480
There's no need to
build an institute either.

777
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,376
I'll have it put on the list
of Eminence even before it's built.

778
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,080
And we'll receive the grant!

779
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,520
Stamp paper,
letterhead, signatures will all be mi.

780
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,640
And you'll handle the rest.

781
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,200
Click the photo properly.

782
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,296
- This is not the right time.
- Brother. Brother.

783
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,400
- Leave me alone.
- Brother.. The wedding..

784
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,880
- Attend the wedding.
- Go from here.

785
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,960
That's Uncle Ashok.

786
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,840
The groom's elder uncle.

787
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,040
Believe it or not,
but he's a big gambler.

788
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,120
What does he do?

789
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,240
He's a manager at some Government Ban.

790
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,640
Tejaswani Bank, I think.

791
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,560
Some branch in Lucknow.

792
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,960
That girl in blue
is his daughter, Jahnvi.

793
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,640
What are you thinking?

794
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,760
Let me do the thinking.

795
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,840
You shouldn't think.

796
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,400
I think you should double
up your protein shakes.

797
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,600
What do you mean?

798
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,720
Mr. Ashok, please come with me.

799
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,320
You can play all you want.

800
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,600
I'll arrange a separate
room for you in the guest-house.

801
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,600
Come. Careful.

802
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,440
Do you have money? Yes.

803
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,840
Come, Uncle. Come on.

804
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,760
Let me help you.
You can play all night there.

805
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,240
You guys continue.

806
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,160
Hello, Jahnvi.

807
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,960
Please come, he's your papa after all.

808
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,040
Careful. Watch your step.

809
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,960
Uncle, don't sit down here.
We've to go ahead.

810
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:21,920
Come on.

811
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,840
I've heard that even you
are a champion of the game.

812
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,560
Not at all uncle, I am just
a messenger carrying out orders.

813
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:35,360
Not at all son, you're a maverick.

814
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,760
- Careful.
- Be careful.

815
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,120
- Be careful with him.
- Yes.

816
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,520
Listen, I wanted to say...

817
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,720
Thank you, brother.

818
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,120
Careful.

819
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,400
I am sorry, but I was about to call y.

820
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,720
Son, this is Sattu's father.

821
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,160
Hello, uncle.

822
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,280
Is everything okay?

823
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,480
He's been rusticated, son.

824
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,216
Please give the phone to Sattu.

825
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,960
He's locked himself in the
room and refuses to speak to anyone.

826
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,840
He hasn't even eaten
anything since morning.

827
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,560
Where is Nupur?

828
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,880
She's gone to fetch the doctor.

829
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,240
Why don't you try talking to him?

830
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,560
Uncle, ask her to call
me as soon as she returns.

831
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,000
I am attending my sister's wedding.
But I'll call back soon.

832
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,840
Don't worry, everything will be okay.

833
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,680
Listen. Time for a family picture.
Come on up.

834
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,520
Wait, brother.

835
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,800
Can't you see His Highness
is on an important call?

836
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,880
Yes, brother.
I was trying to call you yesterday.

837
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,256
I am attending my sister's wedding.

838
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,520
- You strictly said no messages.
- What happened?

839
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,640
They found drugs on him.

840
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,960
On week days,
he gives his college exams.

841
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,120
And on weekends,
he appears for your clients.

842
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,280
He was under tremendous pressure.

843
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,520
He would study all night
and smoke joints all day.

844
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,240
I told him a dozen times not to do it.

845
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,320
But he wouldn't listen.

846
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,401
You had no clue. Then why
the hell have I hired you there?

847
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,960
What could I do?

848
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,400
Someone must have complained.

849
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,600
And the checking was done when
you sent him to Kolkata.

850
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,600
Call Shashi now!

851
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,640
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> They were supposed to lead the way <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

852
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,040
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> But they showed
me the ladder instead. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

853
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,160
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> They were supposed
to teach me to walk <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

854
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,560
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> But they taught me to climb instead. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

855
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:01,560
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> I couldn't touch the sky <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

856
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,320
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> Nor be one with the winds. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

857
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,440
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> I couldn't breathe <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

858
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:14,720
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> And the rest of you
were applauding instead. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

859
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,520
Stop here.

860
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,680
- Park up ahead.
- Come, brother.

861
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,920
He's been put on drips.

862
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:26,080
I tried to give sister Nupur money,
as you asked me to. But she refused.

863
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,160
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> And now the book's torn. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

864
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,920
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> And the answers are wrong. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

865
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:45,160

866
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:51,720
<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> And, no one's accountable
for my dreams. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

867
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,720
I know you're angry right now.

868
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,600
And you're right.

869
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,480
I couldn't come earlier.
There was a wedding at home.

870
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,336
And the arrangements
were my responsibility.

871
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,480
Mom, dad, my family, and...

872
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,960
My wife.

873
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,480
All I had was a little understanding

874
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,440
and a handful of dreams.

875
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,240
For every ordinary person,
the rest of the world is a star.

876
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,080
The same way I thought about you.

877
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,680
Wait a minute.

878
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,600
Do you think that it's my fault
that your brother's in the hospital?

879
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,400
You think I brought him the drugs?

880
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,000
Nupur.

881
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,720
Sattu will be fine.

882
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,600
I've got him a job in Qatar.

883
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,200
I have connections.

884
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,080
That's pretty generous of you,
Rakesh sir.

885
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:53,040
You made a small-town girl see
the entire world right from her home.

886
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,720
But I won't be satisfied
with my old dreams.

887
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,136
My father won't have to
worry about his daughter anymore.

888
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,600
And you won't receive any
more unwanted text messages from me.

889
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,080
Hello.

890
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,960
Am I speaking with Mr. Rakesh Singh?

891
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,040
- Who is speaking?
- I'm Shashank Shekhar.

892
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,360
We spoke about the admission.

893
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,200
We met at your coaching centre.

894
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,880
I don't remember.

895
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,880
Maybe you dialed the wrong number.

896
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,520
But you guaranteed me a seat for my s.

897
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,040
You are mistaken.

898
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,800
Are you Mr. Rakesh?

899
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,240
That's my name, but I think
you're confusing me for someone else?

900
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,160
'Are you Mr. Rakesh?'

901
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,040
'That's my name, but I think
you're confusing me for someone else?

902
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,280
What happened, sir?

903
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,200
He's refusing to even recognize you.

904
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,640
And it's difficult to trace the guy w
appeared for your son's exam for him.

905
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,360
No FIR.

906
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,320
But yes, if at all we
file a case for cheating...

907
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,400
then you can get arrested as well.

908
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,560
Me?

909
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:22,880
Why me?

910
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,840
Actually you should be arrested.

911
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,360
Sir, what if we find the proxy guy?

912
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,640
Don't talk rubbish.

913
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,360
How will we show the connection?

914
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,800
There is no way to recognize his face.

915
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,160
Even if that boy recognizes him...

916
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,200
How are we going to prove it?

917
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,960
We won't get a warrant.

918
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,840
There's no paper trail or evidence.

919
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,240
Except for a lot of promises and cash.

920
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,800
Lots of cash.

921
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,320
- What happened?
- He was cheating.

922
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,240
The money will be
delivered by the evening.

923
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,456
He's one of our boys. The money
will be delivered by the evening.

924
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,600
Don't worry.

925
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,120
Here is your degree.
Look after yourself in Qatar.

926
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,560
Take it.

927
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,280
His condition is not hidden from you.

928
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,040
- Keep this money.
- There's no need for this.

929
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:39,800
Keep it.

930
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,400
Thank you sir.

931
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,000
Bye sir.

932
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,200
Brother, Sattu's father was calling.

933
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,720
No need to answer his call.

934
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,320
The Sattu chapter is over.

935
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,000
New year, new batch, new Sattu.

936
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,920
- I won't get on it.
- Come on..

937
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,880
- Climb on it.
- Come on, Brother Bablu.

938
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,400
Climb on it. Come on. Won't you
listen to your beautiful sisters-in-l.

939
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,576
People climb on a horse,
but you get to climb on a peacock.

940
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,640
- But, sister-in-law...
- Come on.

941
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,240
- Don't touch me.
- Let me help you.

942
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,120
No. Don't.

943
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,456
It's okay, Bablu. Just get on it.

944
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,480
There. Happy now?

945
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,560
You guys are embarrassing
me at my own wedding.

946
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,760
Give me your hand.

947
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,400
Come on, let's go.

948
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,720
- What now?
- This is your wedding.

949
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,600
So you don't get to
leave before you pay up?

950
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,096
Pay! Why don't you cut out my heart?

951
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,480
You made me climb on that peacock.

952
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,000
- Give her the money.
- Come on!

953
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,321
- Brother, don't give them too much.
- I don't have money.

954
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,800
Wait. Take this.

955
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,296
- Here you go. Are you happy now?
- This is just Rs. 10.

956
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,216
- You're such a cheapskate.
- Okay, sing a song for us.

957
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,160
Sing a song.

958
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,280
- Listen. Come here.
- I am not a singer, let's go.

959
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:17,000
This is just Rs. 10.
Don't be such a cheapskate.

960
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,160
Make him sit, sing a few songs.

961
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,080
I'll go get the money.

962
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,160
- Brother, please..
- Come on, sing a song.

963
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,480
- Brother.
- I'm coming.

964
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,920
Come soon.

965
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,640
Brother, don't leave me.

966
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,120
I beg you, sister-in-law, let me go.

967
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,056
- What can I say?
- Will you say something, father-in-l.

968
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:52,120
Go on, go on,
but first make them happy as well.

969
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,760
Oh, God.
Even my father-in-law isn't on my sid.

970
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,400
You're the center of attraction today.

971
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,400
So just make them happy, Bablu.

972
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,680
Sing for them.

973
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,440
You think this is funny.
Sing a song..

974
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,160
Who is it?

975
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:32,040
Sir, I need your keys to move your ca.

976
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,720
Wait.

977
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,520
- Who are you?
- Special branch, raid warrant.

978
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,640
Look. Excuse me,
I know Mr. Jatin Shukla.

979
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,120
I am sure you do.

980
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,560
Go ahead, call him.

981
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,600
We'll get better headlines
if the MLA comes here.

982
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,016
Where do I go?
The wedding is over.

983
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,160
- Now let me go.
- You seem to be in hurry.

984
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,600
Look at her, she is getting sad.
Let me go.

985
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,760
Brother is on his way,
he will give you the money.

986
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,560
This is my residence,
what are you looking for?

987
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,640
Sir, I think you are mistaken.

988
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,280
We're just checking.
Let us do our job.

989
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,600
It's a raid. Let's see.

990
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,960
Look you're just wasting our time.

991
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,880
Sir.

992
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,360
Very good.

993
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,536
The house is registered
under the name of Mr. Sampat.

994
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,640
Mr. Rakesh has no connection to it.

995
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,600
There's no point in telling me all th.

996
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,120
Tell the court.

997
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,680
Bail is ready.

998
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,240
What happened?

999
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,320
- Thank you.
- Shall we go?

1000
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,800
Give me the car keys.

1001
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,400
I'll come later.

1002
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,960
I see. So now you're
going to try harder.

1003
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,960
Cash? Cheque? Demand draft?

1004
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:49,560
Or maybe a gift?

1005
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,200
But your efforts are in vain, Rakesh.

1006
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,760
Because those who make an honest livi.

1007
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,240
Are out of your league.

1008
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,440
I am not some politician
to be afraid of your honesty.

1009
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,240
I respect those who
make an honest living.

1010
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,400
It took you your life's
earning to build your little home.

1011
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,136
But wouldn't it be sad to squander
all of it for your son's admission?

1012
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,040
After all, it's not black money
which you can give in a donation.

1013
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:22,800
Your son couldn't clear
his Engineering exam twice.

1014
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,360
But you never thought of requesting

1015
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,960
your seniors to help out
by putting pressure.

1016
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:35,320
And now, you're shuttling between pri
colleges to get your son's admission.

1017
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,056
You really think they
will give him an admission

1018
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,600
through means of your honesty?

1019
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,440
Can you tell them that your
honesty is out of their league?

1020
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,800
Let your son appear for the
Open Board this time, Mr. Qureshi.

1021
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,056
If he doesn't get the
engineering seat this time

1022
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:57,480
then Mr. Qureshi, the look on
your son's face shouldn't remind you

1023
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,560
that his father sacrificed his son's
future on the altar of his principles.

1024
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,280
But don't worry, nothing will happen.

1025
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,760
Do you think before doing your job
or do you just dart off like a bullet

1026
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,801
I had a tight schedule today but
had to drop everything and come here.

1027
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,040
- But sir...
- Please don't blame Mr. Qureshi.

1028
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,560
He's just doing his duty.

1029
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,440
- I am sorry, Rakesh.
- I am sorry.

1030
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,760
You had to take time
off your busy schedule. Sorry.

1031
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,200
Come, let's go.

1032
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,840
Let's leave. Mr. Qureshi.
Meet me at my residence today.

1033
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,040
Just a second.

1034
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:32,240
Mr. Qureshi, I couldn't clear my medi
entrance exam even in three attempts.

1035
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,760
And even if I had cleared it,
I would've made for a pathetic doctor.

1036
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,760
Because I always wanted to be a singe.

1037
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,640
My younger brother
is a surgeon in the States.

1038
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:44,080
Even today my efforts are
directed towards making sure

1039
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,920
that my father has no complaints.

1040
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,840
All the expenses of my family...

1041
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:53,400
Wedding, reception,
donation, prayer meets, dad's pacemak.

1042
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,120
Are incurred in Indian Rupees.

1043
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,880
Not in Dollars.

1044
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,880
I know what your son's going through.

1045
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,760
Those without any kind of solution
for rote-learning for exams

1046
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,360
are deemed useless by their family,
relatives and society.

1047
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:16,560
And if I've to invent a solution that
shut them up for good, then so be it.

1048
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,480
Good bye.

1049
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,720
Fine, fine, okay.

1050
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,920
Give it. Give it.

1051
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,280
Good. Good.

1052
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,880
What?

1053
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,160
Nothing. Nothing.
Continue. Continue.

1054
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:53,840
Give it.

1055
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,640
No one passes without bribing.

1056
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,440
You too, son.

1057
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,600
Yes, pay up.

1058
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,240
My fee.

1059
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:03,880
I see.

1060
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,360
Pass the book.

1061
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,320
Sir.

1062
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,440
Did you already know the questions?

1063
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:27,680
No, sir.

1064
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,240
I see.

1065
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,720
Qureshi.

1066
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,880
What does your father do?

1067
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:36,800
Government job.

1068
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:40,880
- Sorry, your paper's cancelled.
- But, sir. Sir...

1069
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,680
Your exam's over.

1070
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,080
- No help without paying commission.
- But, sir...

1071
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,480
Leave, Sir...

1072
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,320
Sir... Get lost.

1073
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,680
- Don't do it, sir.
- I said get lost.

1074
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,400
What is it?

1075
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:57,960
You slapped me.
I will get even with you.

1076
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,720
We have worked hard for it.

1077
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,200
What is this?

1078
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,520
Have you lost your mind?

1079
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,360
It will turn to ashes. No.

1080
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:25,880
The entire exam will get cancelled.

1081
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:26,960
Get lost!

1082
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,280
Go away.

1083
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,160
What are you looking at?
I am not joking.

1084
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,760
- Move back.
- I will burn this.

1085
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,400
What is happening there?

1086
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,760
Students, what's going on there?

1087
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:43,560
Go ahead and eat,
Mr. Qureshi is a friend.

1088
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:48,280
You haven't started
accepting capitation fee yet.

1089
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,800
No.

1090
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,000
- Please take something.
- OK no, problem.

1091
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,160
Everything can be managed.

1092
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,280
Papa.

1093
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:57,720
You're back. Yes.

1094
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:01,840
- How was your paper?
- The invigilator tore my answer shee.

1095
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,360
What? But I was saved...

1096
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:05,920
But what exactly happened?

1097
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,120
Rocky arrived in the nick
of time and handled everything.

1098
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,960
Rocky? Who?

1099
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,240
Rakesh.
He said he was your friend.

1100
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,400
You know what?

1101
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,096
The invigilator today was
collecting money from everyone

1102
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,360
and letting them cheat.

1103
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:21,320
I didn't have any money on me!
So he cancelled my paper.

1104
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,600
Then brother Rakesh arrived
and took charge of everything.

1105
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:27,120
He actually made that
invigilator write my exam for me.

1106
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,200
I think I'm going to
top the exam this time.

1107
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,840
Will you take poison
in the name of help?

1108
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:35,360
Did you have to humiliate
your father like this?

1109
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:39,120
One doesn't have to fail
in life to pass an exam. Get it?

1110
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,320
Are you sick or something? No.

1111
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,416
Then why are you wasting
your time eating fruit?

1112
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,056
This buffet costs 1500 per head,
get the main course.

1113
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,320
You know today's Tuesday and I fast.

1114
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,936
Keep some food in the bag then.
We'll have it for breakfast tomorrow.

1115
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,320
We're in Mumbai and she
still can't let go of her Tuesday's.

1116
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,040
Buffet in a 5-star hotel, brother.

1117
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,200
I guess you have a fantastic
scheme on your mind.

1118
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,760
All this is for you.

1119
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,840
If I don't work hard,
then who will feed your children?

1120
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:42,120
Why am I blamed for every scheme?

1121
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,720
Tell me.

1122
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,640
You definitely have
something on your mind.

1123
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:51,840
How much do we earn in Engineering
per seat, not counting expenses?

1124
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,320
How much?

1125
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,840
Around a million or maybe two. Yes..

1126
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,600
A million or two.

1127
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:58,160
Now.

1128
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,840
This is the big MBA game.

1129
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,040
Understand.

1130
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,160
Profits will be double.

1131
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,240
Come on.

1132
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,960
Double? Wait a minute.

1133
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:10,880
And, what about Kota?

1134
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,960
Cricket and exams don't have a season.

1135
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,680
Yes, they don't.

1136
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:19,840
I get it.

1137
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:24,440
Just tell me that
we can retire after this.

1138
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:28,480
And settle down together
in one of those beautiful places..

1139
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,880
They show on National Geometry.

1140
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,960
That's Geography.

1141
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,640
Exactly.

1142
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,840
Listen, Yes.

1143
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:43,200
Money couldn't stop me
from spending a night in jail.

1144
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,760
The real game begins beyond money.

1145
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:47,880
Power.

1146
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,080
And do you know who has power?

1147
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,720
The signatory.

1148
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,840
Someone who doesn't
need to show his wealth.

1149
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:59,640
Someone who doesn't break
the law using his money.

1150
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:00,600
No.

1151
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,840
He just makes laws according
to his convenience.

1152
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,880
The real fun will begin when Lucknow'
Department, Delhi's Government,

1153
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:13,960
New York's Company, and the
people on the highest post will owe m.

1154
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,400
Students.

1155
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,560
And then just watch.

1156
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,360
We'll have all the
files and permissions.

1157
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,216
We'll make the rules and
we'll break them at our will.

1158
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:25,240
I got it.

1159
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,400
I'll have to work harder now.

1160
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,760
Only salaried people work hard.

1161
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:34,280
Rich people hatch scams.

1162
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:37,960
Big scam.

1163
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,280
Go on, eat your fruit.

1164
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:47,240
5 million,
and I'll guarantee the MBA seat.

1165
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:48,920
That's fine.

1166
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,560
But how can you guarantee?

1167
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,960
Am I asking you for money?

1168
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:53,240
I am not.

1169
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:54,560
This is my first time as well.

1170
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,960
Think about yourself.

1171
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:59,880
Even after mugging up RD Sharma,
HC Verma, OP Bansal, and model papers.

1172
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:02,200
What has been the success
rate of your tutorial?

1173
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,560
1 percent or less.

1174
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,120
And my commission?

1175
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:08,680
10 percent.

1176
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:09,960
Parents and..

1177
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:11,376
- What the bloody hell!
- You don't have any sense?

1178
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,000
I told you to get
the letterhead printed.

1179
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,880
You can't do a thing right.

1180
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,360
I will have to talk to your boss.

1181
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,040
Yes, sir. How can I help you?

1182
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:31,240
You can't.

1183
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,040
Even if someone wants to help you,
then how can he?

1184
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:35,440
Sorry.

1185
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,280
Speak to the lady politely.

1186
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,720
Or you might get arrested
for noise pollution.

1187
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:43,320
Sorry, sir.

1188
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,080
Not sir.

1189
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:47,160
Ma'am.

1190
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,480
Sorry, ma'am.

1191
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,720
It's okay.

1192
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:58,800
Nupur.

1193
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,280
Thank you. I didn't have your number.

1194
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,160
Give me your phone.

1195
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,480
Thank you.

1196
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,280
Bye.

1209
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,720
You have not changed even a bit.

1210
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,640
One needs a reason to change,
which I don't have.

1211
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,400
But you look completely different.

1212
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:40,936
Can't say if I am looking different.

1213
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,440
But I definitely feel better.

1214
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:47,480
No more excuses,
and a new reason every day.

1215
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:49,360
Sattu.

1216
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,760
Sattu's in Qatar.

1217
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:51,760
He's okay.

1218
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:54,880
I did come over to your house
once but I think you guys had moved.

1219
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,960
Yes, dad got transferred.

1220
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:00,360
Order? Ginger tea,
or has that changed too.

1221
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:02,680
Same.

1222
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,136
- Two ginger teas.
- Thank you, sir.

1223
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:05,160
Thank you.

1224
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,880
So... All well at home?

1225
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,560
In a way.

1226
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:14,800
Dad refused to speak with me for a ye.

1227
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,600
But now even I am
capable of earning money.

1228
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,360
So we do talk to each other
on my birthday and on Diwali.

1229
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,456
I guess he feels that even
though I didn't get married,

1230
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,200
at least there's no more burden
on him now.

1231
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:26,960
Look, Nupur... No.

1232
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,120
No need for an explanation.

1233
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,320
No, there is a need.

1234
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,400
You don't know how important it is.

1235
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,400
Sattu must have told you
where all the money was coming from.

1236
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:42,560
But Nupur, there's a young timid
Jhansi boy behind my dazzling present.

1237
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:46,560
Who had neither a degree
nor his father's wealth to flaunt.

1238
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:51,480
And, even if I had found a job
the right way,

1239
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,680
then what do you think
would've happened. A long wait.

1240
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,480
I would've lived only to pay bills.

1241
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,576
Bought a TV with my Diwali Bonus.

1242
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,840
And watched the rich
live their life on it.

1243
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,200
I have no intentions to be a hero.

1244
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,160
No time to be a villain.

1245
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,320
I am just a player, playing a game.

1246
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:12,720
Pardon me, but your father
only saw Sattu as an investment

1247
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:14,080
and he saw you like a deal.

1248
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,120
But the two of you were very special

1249
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,560
and I always knew that.

1250
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:27,520
Rakesh, I am embarrassed
about one thing.

1251
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,880
You're married, and I didn't know.

1252
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:34,160
Nupur, I did get married,
but not willingly.

1253
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:39,240
I have a wife who finds joy in taking
care of my family, chores, and shoppi.

1254
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:42,800
Nine years ago,
while fixing my marriage

1255
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:47,240
dad said that a useless boy who
couldn't even clear his entrance exam

1256
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,960
is hardly going to be
able to find himself a girl!

1257
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:51,920
And I couldn't.

1258
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:54,920
I found you a bit late.

1259

1278
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,120
Wait a minute.

1279
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:05,800
Hello.

1280
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:08,640
Happy birthday to you.

1281
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:11,560
Happy birthday, dear Rakesh.

1282
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,800
- Happy birthday to you.
- Thank you.

1283
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,480
We are missing you a lot.

1284
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,880
See, we even ordered cake for you,
Made out of fresh fruit.

1285
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,400
Now take a bite.

1286
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,320
It's nice, smells delicious.

1287
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,960
Are you busy in a meeting.

1288
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,176
Or are you in a lift?
I can hear a song playing at the back.

1289
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:28,960
No, I came out for dinner.

1290
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,120
- All okay.
- Yeah.

1291
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:32,880
Are you busy?

1292
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,840
Here, talk to mom.

1293
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,440
- Hello son.
- Hello, mother.

1294
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:39,960
- Is your TV working fine?
- Yes, granny was saying...

1295
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,496
- Yes, I'll send one for her too.
- Yes, son. But I was saying..

1296
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:43,520
Okay.

1297
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:46,400
Rakesh, I've to go. Listen.
Go to Siddhivinayak tomorrow.

1298
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,200
Okay, talk to your wife now.

1299
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,120
So what did you have for dinner?
Chinese?

1300
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:54,400
I will call back later.
I must go now.

1301
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,280
Okay, okay, take care.

1302
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:58,120
Convey my regards to the person.

1303
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,200
Yes.

1304
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:00,760
Bye.

1305
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,280
Nupur, you're so late.

1306
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,336
The boss has been waiting for you.
Where were you?

1307
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,280
Fine. Rakesh, 5 minutes please.

1308
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,960
- Okay.
- What is it?

1309
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:20,840
Where have you been?

1310
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,160
- Sir, I...
- This is no time to come in.

1311
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,160
Sorry.

1312
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:26,880
Come in.
I've been trying your number.

1313
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:30,280
I want this entire presentation
on my desk in one hour.

1314
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,400
But sir, Ajay said...

1315
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,960
Ajay is your senior.

1316
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,816
I am sure he has other
important business to attend to.

1317
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,760
What were you doing today?

1318
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,056
Didn't I tell you to come early?
And you were on a call..

1319
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,960
You are supposed to work 24/7.

1320
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,120
Rakesh, I guess it's going
to take me longer than expected.

1321
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,560
Can we meet later?

1322
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,520
Is everything okay? Yes.

1323
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,640
Sure?

1324
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,040
Okay.

1325
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,720
You can donate your cash
in religious organizations, sir.

1326
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,440
It will go as anonymous donations,
and then come back to you.

1327
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,960
Mr. Vaidya's political party
is pretty new in this field.

1328
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,760
He'll lend you his complete support.

1329
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,600
20%, that's all.

1330
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,800
20% is too much,
and you know that.

1331
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:18,920
Rocky sir, that Jatin
is taking too much credit.

1332
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,320
Don't judge me by my looks.

1333
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:22,960
I can route your money through Panama.

1334
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:26,056
You can start some companies with me
out there, under pseudo names of cour.

1335
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,936
Or maybe in the name
of one of your family members.

1336
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,520
Let's keep the family out of this.

1337
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:31,240
There's no need for that, sir.

1338
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,280
We can open a company
even with a PO Box number.

1339
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,080
We'll transfer the cash there,
show some profit..

1340
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:39,160
Pay some taxes on that profit
and your money will become legal.

1341
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:41,600
And you can transfer
that money to my party fund.

1342
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,560
And a year later..

1343
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:46,400
You'll have everything like permissio
tenders, education loans, etc.

1344
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,080
I get it.

1345
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:51,480
But if brother Jatin finds
out that you came to see me,

1346
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,240
he'll make you run naked.

1347
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:55,440
You!

1348
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,840
Look. We'll handle him.

1349
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,360
Everyone wants to do business.

1350
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,360
Make me a shareholder.

1351
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,640
Or else?

1352
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,200
Or else what?

1353
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,600
Or else...

1354
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:17,120
I am not threatening you.

1355
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,360
Well, I'll be taking your leave then.

1356
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,200
Bablu. Come here. Yes.

1357
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:22,520
Talk to him.

1358
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,760
He's really scared of threats.

1359
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:26,440
Talk to him.

1360
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,400
Rocky sir...

1361
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:30,600
Do you want to threaten me?

1362
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,120
And then I left immediately.

1363
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:45,560
Are you alright?

1364
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:46,800
Yes.

1365
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,040
Did your boss misbehave with you?

1366
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,800
I can't go for the Zurich offsite.

1367
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,600
I am more of a slave
than a junior employee.

1368
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,920
I make all the presentations..

1369
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:04,936
But I am not allowed
inside the presentation room.

1370
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,720
And they call me
PPT Usha behind my back.

1371
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:09,680
Go ahead, laugh.

1372
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:13,640
Forget it.
And find yourself a new job.

1373
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:20,320
Men!

1374
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,720
As soon as someone refuses
to be their eye-candy...

1375
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:27,560
And starts using her skills,
they start feeling insecure!

1376
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:32,840
Give me your CV.

1377
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,560
It won't matter, Rakesh.

1378
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:37,760
I've talked to everyone I know,
but it's the same old story everywher.

1379
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,360
Then why don't you apply for MBA?

1380
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,040
Because promotion and job
security will only come after that.

1381
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:44,776
Otherwise, you'll be slogging
for the rest of your life.

1382
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,960
But one needs to prepare for it.

1383
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,600
And I have an Arts background
so it'll be much more difficult for m.

1384
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,440
Why don't you try at least?

1385
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,040
I agree.

1386
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:57,800
Fill the application form first.

1387
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,120
Then we'll see.

1388
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:01,600
Okay.

1389
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:02,720
One more drink.

1390
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:03,840
Sure, sir.

1391
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:12,480
Yes tell me.

1392
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,880
Yes, brother.
I know you said MBA game, double prof.

1393
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,240
What do we have to do?

1394
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:18,960
Wait just a minute.

1395
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:19,920
What?

1396
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,960
Not to you, brother.
I am talking to Jahnvi.

1397
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:24,840
For Engineering, it was
one candidate at a time.

1398
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:29,800
But in MBA, we'll make
millions in a conference hall.

1399
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,280
Book a hotel.

1400
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:41,680
Sir, they are booking a room.

1401
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:43,440
Keep me informed.

1402
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,360
And, who are our top students?

1403
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:51,120
Yash Sharma, Pune.

1404
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:52,920
Atul Mohan, Lucknow.

1405
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,760
Shubham Roy, Chennai.

1406
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,840
Call them to Mumbai on 9th
December to crack the MBA paper.

1407
01:21:58,920 --> 01:21:59,920
Okay, brother.

1408
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,080
And then?

1409
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,320
When are we going to
put your father-in-law's

1410
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,040
bank job to use, you idiot?

1411
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,520
Okay, brother. I get it.

1412
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:15,360
Is it something special?

1413
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:18,200
The envelope will reach directly
to one of your bank lockers.

1414
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,400
On 9th December.

1415
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:20,920
I know it does every year.

1416
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,680
I'll inform you as soon
as I find out which branch.

1417
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:27,960
Do you have a tiff with
any of the bank managers?

1418
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,400
No, there's no such thing.

1419
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,080
But...

1420
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:34,000
What is this all about?

1421
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,880
Nice shot.

1422
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,080
All the envelopes that you
receive between 9 a.m. and 12 noon...

1423
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:40,880
I want to check all of them.

1424
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,640
In all the branches?

1425
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:43,800
Listen carefully, dad.

1426
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:46,016
We'll find out which branch first.
Then, after that.

1427
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,200
You're not listening at all.

1428
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:50,640
What if I check it myself?

1429
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,400
No! You won't understand the document

1430
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:55,200
I'll just take a peek and keep it bac.

1431
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:57,680
It will take all of 15 minutes.

1432
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:05,120
'In order to fool the system...'

1433
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,840
'One must cultivate
the fools in the system.'

1434
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:12,120
'Today these fools
will shine like stars.'

1435
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,160
Did anyone come?

1436
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:33,840
No.

1437
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,200
- We're from the Education Board.
- Please sit.

1438
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,480
Please inform your Manager.
He's expecting us.

1439
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:04,840
Thank you.

1440
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,200
Yes, sir. They are here.

1441
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,000
- Oh, it's you.
- Good morning.

1442
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:10,160
Please come. Yes.

1443
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:42,840
Be right back.

1444
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:54,640
Please switch off your phone. Sure.

1445
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:17,840
Why are you sitting there?

1446
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:20,320
We have checked them.

1447
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:22,200
No, go check again.

1448
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:23,680
Go quickly.

1449
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:29,560
They have booked an entire floor.

1450
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,456
And they are not letting
any one go out either.

1451
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:34,280
I am sure he has the
question paper.

1452
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:56,680
MBA Reasoning Question no. 1.

1453
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:59,640
A father and his son are waiting
at a bus stop in the evening.

1454
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:01,800
There is a lamp post behind them.

1455
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:05,520
The lamp post, the father and his
son stand in the same straight line.

1456
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,960
The father observes
the shadows of his head

1457
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:11,120
and his son's head are incident
at the same point of the graph.

1458
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:14,296
You're still studying. We must
get to the office, get ready quickly.

1459
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,136
What? I said get ready,
or we will be late for office.

1460
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:17,160
Not now.

1461
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,800
Should I leave?
Will you come later? Yes.

1462
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:37,720
Name?

1463
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,440
Chandramohan Badani.

1464
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,680
Keep your phones ready.

1465
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:44,480
We'll be verifying every
parent's mobile number.

1466
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,496
They can enter only when
their number is verified.

1467
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:48,240
Everyone, show me your phones first.

1468
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,680
Come on, in a line, please.

1469
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,880
What is your name?

1470
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:52,840
Yes, sir.

1471
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:53,840
Let them in only when their phone rin.

1472
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:54,920
Go that way.

1473
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:56,600
Your name.

1474
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:57,696
- Sumit Saxena.
- Please come here.

1475
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:59,040
What is your name.

1476
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,320
You wait, sir.

1477
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:06,360
That way.

1478
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,880
Deposit your phone here,
Get it checked.

1479
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,480
And go in this way.

1480
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:12,240
Yes, this way. On your left.

1481
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:15,720
Yes, through that door on the back.

1482
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,640
Hello, sir. Recognize me?

1483
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:24,840
Yes, of course. How are you?

1484
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,280
I am great.

1485
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:27,920
Today?

1486
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:29,200
Yes.

1487
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:30,800
- All the best.
- Thank you.

1488
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:33,960
Here.

1489
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:35,680
Offerings.

1490
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:37,600
Take it.

1491
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,320
Hello. Brother,
Yash is refusing to cooper

1492
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,240
I don't know what to do.

1493
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:46,640
Please come here.

1494
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:47,560
Yes, I am coming.

1495
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:48,640
Yes, come quickly.

1496
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:50,600
I know how much profit you're making.

1497
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,360
Management rates have doubled.

1498
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:54,200
So even we should be paid double.

1499
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:56,360
But I am paying everyone equally.

1500
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:57,720
Double of normal.

1501
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,200
I am in my final year.

1502
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:00,856
And I am also the brightest of the lo.

1503
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:02,480
So I should get triple.

1504
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:07,720
Fine. Give him 0.9 millions.

1505
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:11,040
I want it now.

1506
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:12,400
Now?

1507
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,480
Can you wait until tomorrow morning?

1508
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:23,520
Is your residence address still
21F, Lohia Nagar?

1509
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:24,920
Yes, why?

1510
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:28,280
Well, in the last four years,
there's been

1511
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:32,360
Sheila, Rubina, Sakshi,
Sweety, Poonam, and...

1512
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:33,720
Shefali.

1513
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:34,960
Shefali.

1514
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:36,880
I'll send their pictures.

1515
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:40,960
I am sure mom and dad must be looking
for a bride for their engineer son.

1516
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:43,360
I guess one of them
will be perfect for you.

1517
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:44,440
What say?

1518
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:46,960
What?

1519
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:50,680
He looks nervous!

1520
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:53,800
I am just joking.

1521
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,000
Greed is good.

1522
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,600
- No, I...
- Send the money tomorrow.

1523
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:00,920
- No, I'll pay him right now.
- No, no, brother. I'll adjust.

1524
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:03,560
Sure? I'll send it over.

1525
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:06,200
No, no, I'll manage.

1526
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:08,720
Fine, then get to work.

1527
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:09,960
You have an hour.

1528
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:12,200
Bablu. Do it properly.

1529
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:14,560
Give it.

1530
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:16,840
Chandramohan Badani.

1531
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:18,960
Check.

1532
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:23,320
'The number that you're trying
to reach is not reachable.'

1533
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:24,600
It's not reachable.

1534
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,520
Sorry, I lost my phone last week.

1535
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:31,600
Please go with him.

1536
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,520
- What happened?
- Come on.

1537
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:35,320
Come with me.

1538
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:36,640
What happened?

1539
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:38,240
Call on dad's other number.

1540
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:39,560
- Just five minites.
- Come on.

1541
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:40,776
Where are you taking my father?

1542
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,680
Papa. Wait.

1543
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:44,640
I am being honest.

1544
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,200
Even his wife's phone is ringing.

1545
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:51,680
Fine, try the landline.

1546
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:54,080
What now?

1547
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,360
Let's talk to brother Rocky once...

1548
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:04,720
- Hello.
- Hello.

1549
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,160
Did you give me a missed call?

1550
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:09,200
No, madam.
Some gentleman left his phone here.

1551
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:12,720
That's the second time in a month.
Who is this?

1552
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:13,880
His name?

1553
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,000
Chandramohan.

1554
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:16,080
But who are you?

1555
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:17,840
- Badani?
- Yes. Badani.

1556
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:19,040
But who are you?

1557
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:21,720
Security is important.

1558
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:27,600
Please come.

1559
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:35,720
Did you check all the answers properl.

1560
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:36,920
- Yes.
- Yes.

1561
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:41,960
Good job.

1562
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:44,400
Bablu.

1563
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:13,880
There are 100 questions.

1564
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:16,080
I'll be dictating the answers.

1565
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:18,640
Write them down, and memorize them.

1566
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:22,520
Sir. Question paper?

1567
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:25,080
No. I never leak question papers.

1568
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:27,320
Bad for business, bad for the nation.

1569
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:30,680
If you have doubts, you may leave now.

1570
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,800
Sir, my daughter is
pretty fluent in English.

1571
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,360
So if I can get only
the quantitative answers..

1572
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:37,680
Please keep quiet, dad.

1573
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:41,360
If anyone else has
such intelligent questions...

1574
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:44,600
Then they should leave.

1575
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:48,320
Well, without wasting
any more time now,

1576
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:49,640
write them down.

All the best.

1620
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:31,440
Pay them in full. Yeah.

1621
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:33,960
The boys have had a long night.
They won't get up early.

1622
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:35,120
They've hardly slept.

1623
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Brother.

1624
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:49,920
What?

1625
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,840
Sir. Paper.

1626
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:57,560
Not your phone.

1627
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,200
Where's the paper?

1628
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,680
Even if I give it to you,
how will you solve it?

1629
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:08,680
I am sure that you'll show us the way.

1630
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:18,600
Let's go.

1631
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:21,680
Thank you.

1632
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:26,640
Brother.

1633
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:35,400
Jatin. It's Vaidya.

1634
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:37,120
I'll take care of him.

1635
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,200
There are random alphabets
in this paper.

1636
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:48,000
Vaidya's outside the hotel.

1637
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:58,360
Call him. Call him.

1638
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:03,200
- Come on.
- Did you forget your place?

1639
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:21,536
You're playing games on your phone.

1640
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:23,000
And life's playing games with us.

1641
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:24,880
Are you listening?

1642
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:26,760
Brother.

1643
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,360
Brother?

1644
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:32,320
Take it.

1645
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:34,280
Sorry.

1646
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:43,240
Brother.

1647
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:48,840
Hello.

1648
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:52,080
Nupur, meet me in the
parking lot in 15 minutes.

1649
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:53,920
See you.

1650
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:25,680
What happened?

1651
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:32,960
All the answers to tomorrow's exam.

1652
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:35,200
What?

1653
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:37,400
Really?

1654
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:39,280
See for yourself.

1655
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:41,856
Rakesh did you really
see the exam paper yourself?

1656
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:43,640
Or did someone give this to you?

1657
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,560
How can the question paper get leaked.

1658
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:50,240
Rakesh, there are many
frauds roaming in the market!

1659
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:53,800
Do you trust me?

1660
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:56,440
Yes, but how?

1661
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:02,200
Look.

1662
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,840
Are they genuine or not?

1663
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:09,480
Is it?

1664
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,120
Come on, get him.

1665
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:17,520
Don't try to move.

1666
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:20,040
Nupur, get his phone. Get his phone.

1667
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:23,480
- Nupur, get his phone.
- Get his phone.

1668
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:24,800
Hold him.

1669
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:33,480
Catch him.

1670
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:43,440
I'm sorry.

<i><font color="#FF0080">♪</font> Yes, you are
accountable for my dreams. <font color="#FF0080">♪</font></i>

1691
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:42,600
You ruined the lives of
thousands of deserving candidates.

1692
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:46,600
And you made those students doctors
and engineers who had only one asset.

1693
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,640
Rich parents.

1694
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:51,160
'No need to study hard.'

1695
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:55,360
'Need admission in a prestigious coll
contact Mr. Rakesh.'

1696
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:58,520
I didn't ruin any lives.

1697
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:01,880
There are no exams
to become politicians.

1698
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:05,040
But you still let them run the countr.

1699
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,120
And anyway, these Entrance
Exams are a slap on students' faces.

1700
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:10,496
Doesn't matter how hard you study...

1701
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:13,440
But that one day and that
one paper will decide your entire lif.

1702
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:16,720
And in a country where millions of
students appear for entrance exams...

1703
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:19,160
But you have only
a few thousand seats.

1704
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:22,640
You shouldn't be talking
about 'deserving' and 'undeserving'!

1705
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:25,760
Are the others who
couldn't pass undeserving?

1706
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,680
Tomorrow if you increase
the number of seats...

1707
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:30,920
The so-called undeserving
students will become deserving.

1708
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:33,400
Can you make them capable
enough to compete?

1709
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:35,160
No. Enough, Enough, Mr. Singh.

1710
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:37,400
You're making me all teary-eyed!

1711
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:41,360
Whatever you did...

1712
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:45,280
You did for money.

1713
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:48,640
Everything else is rubbish.

1714
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:53,920
The court has seen enough people who
justify themselves by blaming the sys.

1715
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:55,800
And you're not helping some

1716
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:57,960
30 underprivileged
children to become geniuses.

1717
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:00,760
You're just filling your
pockets by corrupting others.

1718
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:05,640
Do you know that the fee
of these coaching institutes..

1719
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:08,720
Is as much as an ordinary
man's entire life-savings?

1720
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:11,440
Private schools are
giving extra classes..

1721
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:14,800
And government schools fail to even
appoint a teacher throughout the year.

1722
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:17,440
Which means that either
children study on their own

1723
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:18,960
or they become street hawkers!

1724
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:23,080
And if I've made a
buck from some rich kids...

1725
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:26,080
And helped fill the pockets
of some needy, brilliant students,

1726
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:27,760
I haven't done anything wrong.

1727
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,240
Whether one has a degree or not...

1728
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:33,056
Just by one single phone
call from their family or relative,

1729
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:35,800
these students get
a bonus and promotion first.

1730
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:39,240
The system is only generating
rote-learners in bulk

1731
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:41,200
which has no basis or use.

1732
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:46,120
Your honour, please advise him to
save his emotional speech for the med.

1733
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:49,520
Why is he wasting his 7000
million worth of precious time here?

1734
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:52,920
His engineers must be making
weak bridges that can collapse.

1735
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:56,680
His doctors must be running a
business in their clinic and hospital.

1736
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:01,960
And bank managers must be preparing
fake bank guarantees on his say-so.

1737
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:04,560
These people have infiltrated
deep inside the system.

1738
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:06,360
And are weakening it.

1739
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:08,960
The situation is impossible to fix.

1740
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:13,320
Mr. Singh, I admit that
our system isn't that great.

1741
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:18,400
But what did you do
by bending the system?

1742
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:24,920
You trapped a needy boy and killed hi.

1743
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:27,960
Satyendra Dubey, Rank 287.

1744
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:33,520
That's all, your honour.

1745
01:46:58,040 --> 01:46:59,680
Sir, someone's here to see you.

1746
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:20,240
How are you?

1747
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:22,400
Are they feeding you properly?

1748
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:23,960
You seem to have lost weight.

1749
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:28,240
In fact, I've put on a bit of weight
thanks to Brother Jatin's hospitality.

1750
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:31,240
- Tea or coffee?
- Let it be.

1751
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:33,120
Okay.

1752
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:38,320
My son.

1753
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:40,480
The one whom you helped
clear his Engineering.

1754
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:42,800
Please send some plates.

1755
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,560
Okay, sure.

1756
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:51,840
Not a single worry line on your face.

1757
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:54,680
And, you can't imagine what
we've been going through out there.

1758
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:56,120
Do you even have a clue?

1759
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:58,960
No one from our family
has ever been to the court.

1760
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:01,880
Inder uncle, don't get restless.

1761
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:04,920
The media will get bored
of this case in a couple of months.

1762
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,240
And then we'll bail him out easily.

1763
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:09,800
It will take time for
the situation to calm down.

1764
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:11,200
But I must admit.

1765
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:13,840
Your son is a big hit
among the students.

1766
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:15,920
He is a godfather.

1767
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:19,360
And many from the youth
wing are restless to meet you.

1768
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:22,680
I can't show my face
to anyone in my own city.

1769
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:25,560
I don't think you're
feeling embarrassed at all.

1770
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:29,560
I always knew
this boy was not right.

1771
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:32,360
Tell me something, uncle.

1772
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:37,080
Has anyone in your locality
ever been picked up in a VIP car?

1773
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:40,400
And as for your reputation,
it's just a point of view.

1774
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:43,960
Look at Rakesh, he's sitting
here so humbly with his head down.

1775
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:48,200
And that Qureshi is proudly
managing traffic in Nagaland!

1776
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:53,400
I'll get Bollywood to make
a smashing biopic on Rakesh!

1777
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:56,280
Then even you'll feel proud of him!

1778
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:59,960
Don't even think about
associating my name with yours.

1779
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:05,440
People knew me as an American
Surgeon's father, Inderjeet.

1780
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:07,400
Now they call me...

1781
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:11,040
A fraud's father, Inderjeet Singh.

1782
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:17,920
I am proud to be in this
Inderjeet Institute of Technology.

1783
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:23,240
And I am very thankful to Mr. Jatin.

1784
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:26,480
He spared his precious
time to be with us.

1785
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:28,760
And...

1786
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:32,160
And I am proud of my son, Rakesh.

1787
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:36,640
His hard work and struggle have borne
fruit in the form of this institute.

1788
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:39,320
As you all know...

1789
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:44,640
'Well, finally dad's other
son has also become capable.'

1790
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:48,080
'And as for the player...'

1791
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:50,360
'Well, he never retires.'

1792
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:53,120
'Just the scam gets bigger.'
