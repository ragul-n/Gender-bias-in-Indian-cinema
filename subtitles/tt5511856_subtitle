1
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,020
Mother

2
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,580
Father. Brother-in-law is coming

3
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,880
What did you say?

4
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,070
Brother-in-law has come

5
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,500
Why has he come after
everything is over?

6
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,290
What does he belong here now?

7
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,970
Is he not satisfied
ruining our lives?

8
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,030
I’m warning you. Do not take him in

9
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,490
Now, we don’t share
any relation with him

10
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,840
And yes, if he says anything wrong
then I will break his jaw

11
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,640
I’m warning you

12
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,990
Salutations!

13
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,410
Salutations!

14
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,360
Sit

15
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,580
Brother-in-law,
shall I give you water?

16
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,720
Hmm

17
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,140
Take it

18
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,680
What brings you here?

19
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,400
Is Halim there?
- Hmm..

20
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,050
I wanted to speak to
you something important

21
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,600
Tell me

22
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,660
I’ve come to take her away

23
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,280
You can’t take your wife back
after the 'talaq'(divorce)

24
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,500
Don't you know?

25
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,840
I know

26
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,590
But this is not the procedure of
divorce in our religion, right?

27
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,120
We can't divorce
our partner all of a sudden

28
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,450
Even if we want to,
it takes three months

29
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,180
We need to say 'Talaq' every month

30
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,410
That too in presence of the few
jury members of the society

31
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,100
Also need to return the token amount
taken during the marriage

32
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,280
I haven't done anything of that sort

33
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,460
So as per the religious practice,
we are still married

34
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,760
In that case,

35
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,380
why did you let my daughter
stay here for 2 years?

36
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,050
You know my condition

37
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,970
I couldn't say anything to mother

38
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,170
That time my mother was alive

39
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,730
What?

40
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,380
When did this happen?
- Six months passed

41
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,190
Why didn't you inform us?
- Yes

42
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,880
Hatred is kept aside
during bad times

43
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,790
We would have at least
come for the last rites

44
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,840
Leave it

45
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,840
If I had come soon
after mother's death

46
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,490
it wouldn't look good

47
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,270
That's why I have come now

48
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,640
It would be better if
he had died earlier

49
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,250
Let it be, son-in-law

50
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,090
You must not use bad
words for the dead

51
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,540
Let bygone be bygone

52
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,640
Okay

53
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,260
See you

54
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,270
I want to settle down
with Halim again

55
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,610
Let me know your decision

56
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,600
I will come on next Friday

57
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,470
Bye

58
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,070
Bye

59
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:19,410
"God is great."

60
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,850
Hey!

61
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,820
Do you listen to me?

62
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,260
Will smoking solve the problem?

63
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,260
What do we do now?

64
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,650
Don't make noise

65
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,930
We should think of
our daughter's betterment

66
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,170
It's no use digging the past

67
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:58,120
Son-in-law has personally come
to take her away. So let her go

68
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,000
Even her mother-in-law is no more.
She will live happily

69
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,120
Sister. Sister

70
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,960
What happened?

71
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,990
Nothing.
- Eat something

72
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,900
Eat

73
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,480
If you love her so much,
why did you leave her then?

74
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,380
Because of my mother.
Mother had made her life hell

75
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,060
With the daybreak,
mother would attack on her

76
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,610
with her abusive language

77
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,090
Everyone starts working
from early morning

78
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,490
But she's sitting idle over here

79
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,460
My bad luck

80
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,470
Idiot, are you dead?

81
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,820
Huh? Can't you work in speed?

82
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,040
Will you take so much
time making a cup of tea?

83
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,160
Do you hear me, you idiot?

84
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,700
Yes, mother, I'm giving you.
- Get it, fast

85
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,620
She had to marry my son only.
My bad luck

86
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,020
Give it

87
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,660
Are you going, son?
- Yes

88
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,630
Take your lunch box

89
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,750
Hey, lazy girl,
did you pack his lunch box?

90
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,570
Has he married you
for making you rest?

91
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,580
Will you let my son starve?

92
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,080
Hey, do you hear me?

93
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,520
Can't do a single job properly.
She makes her husband starve

94
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,740
and keeps eating the entire day.
Gobbler

95
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,310
He has left now.
Are you blind?

96
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,250
Lazy

97
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,780
Every chores is late

98
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,660
Now will you keep me starving

99
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,970
So, what you wanted
has happened, right?

100
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,000
When will you get rid of this sin?

101
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,450
Idiot

102
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,880
Are you brought here for
praising you all the time?

103
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,130
Or will your mother come
and do these chores?

104
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,310
Now, you will also
starve the entire day

105
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,710
I will break your bones
if you eat even a morsel

106
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,450
Don't cry, Halim

107
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,830
I can understand everything
but what do I do?

108
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,650
After all, she's my mother

109
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,980
I tried to explain her a lot of time

110
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,250
But everyone's nature is different.
What can we do in this?

111
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,800
Don't take her words seriously

112
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,110
Come. Let's eat

113
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,640
Don't vent your anger on food

114
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,270
Come on

115
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,600
See, even I won't eat
if you wouldn't eat

116
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,820
Come

117
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,390
Halim

118
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,780
Halim

119
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,710
Halim

120
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,310
Yes

121
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,900
Bring water.
- Yes, I will

122
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,160
Hurry up

123
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,060
Halim

124
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,850
I will bring it.
- Are you deaf?

125
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,410
Have you died or what?

126
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,480
Coming

127
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,790
I'm calling out to you
from such a long time

128
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,570
Can't you hear?

129
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,220
What did you put in the water?

130
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,870
Want to kill me?

131
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,810
Are you blind?
- What have I done?

132
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,780
Will you argue with me? Will you?

133
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,670
Let me show you now

134
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,690
Tell her to die

135
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,150
You will kill her if she stays here

136
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,790
Nothing doing.
Now, I will end this matter

137
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,590
Halim.
Our relation is over now

138
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,380
I'm divorcing you.
'Talaq'. 'Talaq'. 'Talaq'

139
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,210
Yes, defame me in the village

140
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,280
Make a scene of me in the village

141
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,100
My son's life is
ruined because of you

142
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,660
Go, don't come back.
You proved me bad in the society

143
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,670
Let's go.
- You proved me wrong

144
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,560
How will you pay this sin

145
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
Don't cry

146
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,650
Come here

147
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,690
Come, sit here

148
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,110
Sit

149
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,430
Don't cry

150
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,800
I'm not angry on you

151
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,130
You know that it is my mistake

152
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,510
But nothing is in my control

153
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,670
I'm not even thinking
of divorcing you

154
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,190
But I can't drive away
my mother from the house

155
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,390
People will spit on me if I do that

156
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,000
They will say that I've driven
away mother for my wife

157
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,680
If I drive you away
they will praise me

158
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,950
that I've driven out
my wife for my mother

159
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,940
See, if I really let you stay with
me she will kill you one day

160
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,680
Instead, you go home

161
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,500
You're fine there

162
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:34,180
Hey.. but I want to stay with you

163
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,740
She will kill you if you stay here.
So what do I do now?

164
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,740
You think I don't
want you in my life?

165
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,980
But if you stay here,

166
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,490
I don't want to take
the sin of killing you

167
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,220
Come

168
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,590
Come with me

169
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,800
Come

170
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
Come

171
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,440
But now my mother is no more

172
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,450
Now, I there's no problem
if I bring her back

173
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,970
Even I can't live without her

174
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,060
She's my wife

175
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,710
2 years are more than enough.
- Yeah

176
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,910
With the daybreak this
man starts smoking

177
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,200
No financial support
at all from his side

178
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,870
How long I can run everything alone?

179
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,630
We have three daughters

180
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,400
But this man is least bothered

181
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,490
Things are getting difficult
to settle one daughter

182
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,810
Wonder what future has in store

183
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,810
What will happen? God is there

184
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,420
He will do good

185
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,650
Yes, God has heard our prayers.
Sister's mother-in-law died

186
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,760
Now, the king and the queen
will be all alone at home

187
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,950
Is that so?

188
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,790
Hey, sister will take
me along and not you

189
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,180
Isn't it?
- Yes, I will take you along

190
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,990
Take her. My burden will reduce

191
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,330
I will go with sister.
She won't take you

192
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,480
Get away

193
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,640
Halim can't go back

194
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,810
What?

195
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,350
What did you say?

196
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:32,290
We can't send Halim back

197
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,100
This practice is not
followed in our religion

198
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,250
Don't talk nonsense. Are you mad?

199
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,640
Son-in-law had personally
come to take her away

200
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,910
Why can't we send her?

201
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,380
I've never seen this in my life

202
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,990
that one can take
back his divorced wife

203
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,210
This practice is not
there in our religion

204
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,710
But.. - A divorcee
can marry another man

205
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,430
But she can't return
to her first husband

206
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,980
I know this for sure

207
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,720
But son-in-law said
that even Quran doesn't accept

208
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,670
divorce given in anger

209
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,540
And he also didn't
return the token amount

210
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,790
Without returning the token amount
divorce is not legal

211
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,060
What does he know?

212
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,250
As if you know everything

213
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,420
As if you live life on God's saying

214
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,320
I'm telling you as much as I know

215
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,160
I've never seen a husband
who has returned the token amount

216
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,050
No one does this, these days

217
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,610
Once divorced, woman returns home

218
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,540
And rots all her life or remarries

219
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,620
And it is difficult to
get a husband second time

220
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,740
But a man does second marriage

221
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,270
And he even marries
an unmarried girl

222
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,030
Men after all, are a sly

223
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,120
Even if we wish to send her,
what will people say?

224
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,850
Our society will not accept this

225
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,810
Why are you concerned
about people's opinion?

226
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,650
Son-in-law himself had
come to take her away

227
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,350
We've two more daughters at home

228
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,720
I don't want to ruin
their lives for one daughter

229
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,100
What a life!

230
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,060
Its worst than a dog

231
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,030
Then what should we do now?

232
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,610
I don't know that

233
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,330
I will consult our priest

234
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,520
He will suggest a solution

235
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,630
You don't worry

236
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,200
We are going to meet priest

237
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,860
Salutations!

238
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,910
We will ask him.
Will find some way

239
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,910
Salutations!

240
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,750
Salutations!

241
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,220
Salutations!
- Salutations!

242
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,020
Come, sit. Sit

243
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,640
Well, we wanted to speak
to you about something

244
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,680
Yes, tell me

245
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,430
You know that Balu's daughter

246
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,080
is divorced 2 years ago

247
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,630
Balu,

248
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,630
what has happened has happened

249
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,310
How long will you let her live alone?

250
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,860
Find a better match
and get her remarried

251
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,650
That's why I've come to you

252
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,900
Why? What has happened?

253
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,870
Balu's son-in-law had
come home yesterday

254
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,350
He was talking of taking away Halim

255
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,340
Is it?
- Hmm

256
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,160
I've never seen this in my life

257
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,970
that a woman has
returned to her husband

258
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,480
Hmm

259
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,780
I've heard about it.
But I've never seen in my life

260
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,260
This is a totally new matter

261
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:07,090
But Balu, Quran has answers
to all the questions in life

262
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,780
Of this world as well
as the other world

263
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,850
But my son-in-law says that the way
he divorced her was not legal

264
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,940
And he also didn't
return the token amount

265
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,170
The boy is correct

266
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,070
According to the holy Quran, it is
illegal to divorce someone like this

267
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,570
It is wrong

268
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,510
Three month's time is
given to divorce anyone

269
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,170
Every month,
in presence of the jury members

270
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,030
one has to declare his divorce

271
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:43,000
But these days, it has become the
trend of divorcing wife in this way

272
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:47,400
People don't follow
what is said in Hadith

273
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,060
They twist and turn it
as their requirement

274
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,690
If your son-in-law knew this

275
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,400
then why did
he divorce her in this way?

276
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,420
He said he was angry at that time

277
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,740
And his anger calmed down after
divorcing his wife, right?

278
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,320
Let bygone be bygone

279
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,030
Now you tell me what I should do now

280
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,730
Let me tell you, Balu

281
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,170
In such a situation,
Holy Quran says that..

282
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:25,500
Halim can't marry Kuddus so easily

283
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,390
Meaning? I didn't understand

284
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:36,310
Hadith prescribes a proper tradition
to be followed by every Muslims

285
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,180
It is called 'Halala' (legitimate)

286
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,580
'Halala'

287
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,820
According to this, if
your son-in-law wants to take away

288
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,710
Halim to his house,

289
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,280
he will have to remarry Halim

290
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:58,780
But before that your daughter
must marry another man

291
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,410
That man can divorce her

292
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,090
only after her 'Iddat'
(waiting period) is over

293
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,690
If she turned out to be pregnant

294
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,990
then that man can divorce her only
after she gives birth to a child

295
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,760
And only after that

296
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,610
Kuddus can remarry Halim

297
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,580
Doing anything against
this rule is illegal..

298
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,870
as per the religious practice

299
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,210
Isn't there any other
solution to this?

300
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:32,990
No,

301
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,280
Balu

302
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,760
This rule is made for those men..

303
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,990
who consider women their slave,
or use them

304
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,930
This rule is made to
bring them down to earth

305
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,900
Come to me without hesitation
if you need any help

306
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:16,430
It's our duty to unite the lovers

307
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,110
Kuddus and Halim's
marriage will become

308
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,980
an example in the village

309
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,280
Bye.
- Bye

310
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:52,630
"God is great."

311
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,380
What rule is this?

312
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,040
Son-in-law is ready to take her away

313
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,450
But this is something new now

314
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:03,010
It's nothing new.
It's mentioned in our religion

315
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,430
We must follow it

316
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,320
But are you convinced with it?

317
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,810
Can't we think of any other solution?

318
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,670
It is mentioned in the Quran
that is followed everywhere

319
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,950
Even the priest said
there's no other solution

320
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,330
But..
- Don't get on my nerves

321
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,170
This is a custom

322
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,320
If we want to send
our daughter back

323
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,320
then we must follow it

324
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,220
I had never heard of such a thing.
Is it really possible?

325
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,600
I also heard it for the first time

326
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,660
In our religion,
a woman can easily go back to

327
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,510
her in-law's house
even if she has stayed

328
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,420
at her maternal house
for 2 or more years

329
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,610
And this second marriage in
your religion is totally strange

330
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,250
This is a rule in our religion.
We can't change it

331
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:07,350
This rule is made to
punish a husband

332
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,290
who leaves woman
anytime on his will

333
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,480
Now, he must pay for it

334
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,330
Tell me one thing. If this rule
is made to punish a husband

335
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,260
then how's he suffering in this?

336
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,720
Woman has to suffer by getting
married to another man

337
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:21,680
Hmm

338
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,820
Mother, I'm going. Yes

339
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,410
God

340
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,430
Hello, chief.
- Hello. How are you?

341
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,640
You seem to be in a hurry today

342
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,580
Yes, Balu's daughter's
matter needs to be resolved

343
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,430
I'm going there.
- It's a big problem in a way

344
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,670
He should have quietly sent his
daughter but started with all this

345
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,430
Now, this is a custom
in their religion

346
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,060
So one must follow it.
- Yes

347
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,300
And when their priest has said,

348
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,550
we can't avoid him.
- That's true

349
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,010
I will go there, okay?
- Yes. Okay

350
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,590
God!

351
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,910
Vanna, bring some water

352
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,490
Feeling very thirsty

353
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,960
When is son-in-law coming?

354
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,790
How do I know?

355
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,300
You've informed everyone else, right?

356
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,900
Even they haven't come as yet

357
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,130
Why should I call them
unless the son-in-law arrives?

358
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,940
Why waste on tea?

359
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,260
Let the son-in-law come.
Then we will call them

360
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:43,860
Salutations.
- Salutations

361
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,220
Sit

362
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,790
Give him water

363
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:49,010
Yes,

364
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,100
here

365
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,380
Sit, I will come in a moment.
Make some tea for him. - Yes

366
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,330
Take it.
- Take it

367
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:41,930
Okay, son-in-law,
it's good if everything is followed

368
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:44,240
as per the customs and religions

369
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,870
Right?
- Yes

370
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,170
I never deny

371
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,680
I'm here for that

372
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,150
I just want to take Halim back

373
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,080
You want to take her away, right?
Okay then

374
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,820
Follow the religious customs

375
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:03,240
Take her away and live happily

376
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,510
Yes, but I didn't understand

377
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,560
What do you mean by
religious customs?

378
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,580
What's the religious custom?

379
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:17,700
Son-in-law, as per the rule if
you want to take back Halim

380
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,670
then you must marry her again

381
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:25,480
But before that Halim
should marry someone else

382
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,830
and when he divorces her,

383
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:31,440
you can remarry Halim
and live with her

384
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,680
Otherwise, you cannot

385
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,920
You all know our financial condition

386
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,300
I can't afford the second
marriage of one daughter

387
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,160
Hey!

388
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,470
I still have two more daughters

389
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:52,690
Balu, everyone's fate is with him

390
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,240
If it is about
your daughter's betterment

391
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,800
then God is there

392
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,730
Why do you worry?

393
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,550
You tell us what do we do now

394
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,770
What will I say?
Whatever son-in-law says

395
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,830
I want to take Halim back

396
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,120
But don't you think this rule of
marrying another man is strange?

397
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,770
How can anyone marry off
his wife with someone else?

398
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,540
Look, son-in-law

399
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:32,840
After you divorced her,
now she's not your wife

400
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:37,800
You will divorce a woman
anytime you wish to

401
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,900
Then what should that woman do?

402
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,580
What is her fault?

403
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,130
No one should do this
in life that's why..

404
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,320
this rule is made in our religion

405
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,020
so as to punish the man

406
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,900
I didn't know this rule

407
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,910
Now, you understood it, right?

408
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,070
So, now decide what to do

409
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,460
I can't understand
these religious rules

410
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:07,380
You can't, right?
Then don't worry

411
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:12,340
Rest assured and do as we say

412
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,320
Tell me one thing,
you love Halim, right?

413
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,450
You can do anything for her, right?

414
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,780
You want to take her away, right?

415
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,820
Then do as I say

416
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,840
Let everything happen
as per the religious way

417
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,390
We will get Halim married
to someone temporarily

418
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,480
And then we will tell
him to divorce her

419
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,710
Once, she is divorced
we will get you both remarried

420
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,230
Then live happily

421
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,620
What say?
- Yes

422
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,190
So, what do you think about this,
son-in-law?

423
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,360
I need to ask
the priest from our village

424
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,710
Look, son-in-law

425
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,820
Whether it is said by priest of
this village or that village

426
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,660
The rules mentioned
in Quran don't change

427
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,690
Every Muslim all over the world
has to follow the same rules

428
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,050
It doesn't change anywhere.
Right?

429
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,560
Hmm

430
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:24,020
Let him ask. For his satisfaction

431
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,160
Right, son-in-law?

432
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,310
Yes, let's go

433
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:34,430
Son-in-law,
let me say this as I'm elder to you

434
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:38,290
Now, that you've stepped
further don't step back

435
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,370
It's lucky to get a wife like Halim

436
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,310
Don't desert her now

437
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:47,800
Look, God has made rules
for our betterment

438
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,570
You love her, right?
You want her, right?

439
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,510
Then we must follow
the rules... The religious customs

440
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:58,700
Besides all of us are there with you.
Don't worry

441
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:03,160
And Balu,
don't worry about the money

442
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,460
Don't let your daughter stay
at home for money constraints

443
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,000
I'm there. I will help you

444
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,610
And you're lucky to get
such a good son-in-law

445
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:14,220
Don't let him go.
- Yes

446
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,630
Everything will happen
as per God's wish

447
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,220
Okay? See you

448
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,090
Bye.
- Bye

449
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,130
We must help him after all.
- Bye

450
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:23,850
Right

451
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:26,280
Who else will otherwise help him?
- That's why I was telling

452
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,490
Did you ask Halim?

453
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,040
What's to ask her?

454
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,720
She's a girl.
What does she understand in this?

455
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,820
She will do what we say

456
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,110
Still I think we should ask Halim

457
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,190
What do I say?

458
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,010
You ask her

459
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:58,910
Halim

460
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,160
Halim

461
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,010
Halim.
Come out

462
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,390
What do you think? What should we do?

463
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,890
What do I say?

464
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,600
Whatever you decide

465
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,430
Have you thought over this?

466
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,630
I don't understand anything else

467
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,130
I just want to live with you

468
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,330
Alright then

469
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:09,070
Then even I'm ready

470
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,370
You look for a boy

471
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,510
And let everything happen
as per the religious rules

472
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,170
Once he divorces Halim
I will remarry her

473
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,410
See you

474
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,690
Bye

475
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,350
Bye

476
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,990
So, what is decided, Pasha?

477
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,500
About what?

478
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,630
Marrying Balu's daughter

479
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,000
Are you mad? You're talking anything

480
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,630
Why? What happened?

481
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:07,610
You will get such a good wife
like Halim for three months

482
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,960
You're getting
an opportunity and you.

483
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,120
So you take this opportunity.
Why do you tell me?

484
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:17,690
I already have one.
I can't afford to spend after her

485
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,600
But you have the options to
manage with more than one

486
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,170
Think over it

487
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,280
You will not have to
spend much on her

488
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,140
It's so strange!

489
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:32,200
Halim's husband has agreed to
marry her off with another man

490
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,280
Is he not ashamed?

491
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,460
Such different things are
happening in our village

492
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,960
What's different in this?
- It is

493
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,620
This is in their religion

494
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,600
Religion.
But that son-in-law is quite strange

495
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,740
He's ready to let her
marry another man

496
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,830
It is really lucky to get
such a husband in this time

497
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,020
He loves her a lot

498
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,100
That's true. Halim is really lucky

499
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,420
It is her 2 years penance

500
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,030
May she be blessed!

501
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,320
Hope she gets a good
husband this time

502
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,610
Yes. - Otherwise,
if he wouldn't divorce her then..

503
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,410
They will consider this point
before marrying her off

504
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,460
It's not that.
- Then?

505
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,530
Halim is beautiful.
- Yes

506
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,360
And it doesn't take time for
a man to change from his word

507
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,270
Yes

508
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,170
Then

509
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,740
I hope she gets a gentleman

510
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,780
Amen!

511
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,080
Sister

512
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,880
What do you think?

513
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,840
Will everything be fine?

514
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,400
I find it really very strange

515
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,330
But brother-in-law loves you a lot

516
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,440
He's very good

517
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,410
He can do anything for me

518
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,190
We can see that

519
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,680
Hey..

520
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,730
He had divorced me for my sake only

521
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,990
He couldn't see my plight

522
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:30,360
But this rule, your second marriage?

523
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,670
Are you ready for all this?

524
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,630
Now, I can't see him in pain

525
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:47,490
If he wanted,
he would have remarried by now

526
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,050
But he didn't do that

527
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,650
You're right

528
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,640
Now, even
your mother-in-law is no more

529
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,200
You can live happily with him

530
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,850
But I can't understand
about this rule

531
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,210
Leave it

532
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,260
The elderly people are there

533
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,160
They will decide

534
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:23,080
Whatever is God's wish

535
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,390
Now, go to sleep

536
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,120
That's true

537
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,670
We can say anything

538
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,280
But brother-in-law is a good man

539
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:43,250
I wish you get someone
like him again

540
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,650
We will find another boy?

541
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,340
But marry her with him

542
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,430
And then remarry her with son-in-law

543
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,860
How will we manage?

544
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,330
Our two daughters are
yet to be married off

545
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,950
How do we arrange for
such a big amount?

546
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,150
People will help us but how much?

547
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,540
And how do we repay them?

548
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:35,110
We haven't repaid the loan taken
for Halim's first marriage

549
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,410
If we have to go on repaying
the loans what do we eat?

550
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,510
We will die in this struggle

551
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,910
My mind is totally blank now

552
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:55,510
God only knows how many
generations will die in this way

553
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:02,380
Wonder why poor has
to suffer so much?

554
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:12,490
For which of our sin
God is punishing us?

555
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,010
What life is this?

556
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,290
Just go on working from
morning till evening

557
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,050
Why are you so tired?

558
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:36,580
My mother-in-law.
She's a headache

559
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:39,120
Take it as your fate.
You have to tolerate her

560
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,370
That's true

561
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,480
One should be lucky
enough like Halim

562
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,470
And husband should be like Kuddus

563
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,700
Leave her with her parents
until his mother is alive

564
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,670
And take her back
after mother's death

565
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:52,790
But before returning to him
she has to marry another man

566
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,670
Will you go?
- Not at all

567
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:58,710
Go, you will get some change.
- Shut up

568
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,650
What happened now?

569
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,080
You have spoken with them, right?

570
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,650
I did a big mistake
by divorcing Halim

571
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,880
My wife and..

572
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,320
But this is a rule in your religion

573
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,790
It's not in your hand.
- You're right

574
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,760
Someone will marry
your wife temporarily

575
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,260
Can't tolerate

576
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:35,230
You're left with no choice.
- I agree

577
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:41,000
But what if the man
she marries doesn't divorce her?

578
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,620
His intention can change
after seeing Halim

579
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,780
What do I do if
he doesn't divorce her?

580
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,890
Don't think nonsense.
Everything will be fine

581
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:54,820
And we will discuss about all
this before fixing alliance

582
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:56,740
It's not a big problem

583
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:00,910
If he doesn't divorce her,
even Halim can ask for the divorce

584
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,650
Then what's the problem?

585
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,450
And what if Halim also
didn't divorce him?

586
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:08,730
Are you mad? She loves you a lot

587
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:10,450
Even I love her a lot

588
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:13,480
But my mind is getting blank

589
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:17,380
You both love each other a lot.
God can see that

590
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,480
Everything will be fine

591
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:24,540
But I can't even find
a temporary husband for her

592
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,800
It feels good if he doesn't but then
I feel why can't I find any

593
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,570
Don't understand anything

594
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:35,030
Chief, I'm convinced
with what you say

595
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,770
We don't have any other option

596
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:39,720
We will see what happens next

597
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,500
If all of you are convinced then..

598
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,470
It's not a big issue.
I will speak to him

599
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:44,810
Fine

600
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:46,500
Yes, come Balu. Come

601
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,820
Salutations.
- Hello

602
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:53,260
Balu, chief's opinion
is worth pondering over

603
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,430
As you say

604
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,320
My mind has stopped working

605
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:04,390
I'm already indebted with
one daughter's marriage

606
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,330
Now, I've to marry her off twice

607
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:09,560
And I've two more daughters

608
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,070
You've started with it again

609
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,440
We promised to help you. Right?

610
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:16,170
We will also make
your son-in-law help in this

611
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:20,360
But... - Balu,
at least listen to what chief says

612
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,130
Speak up

613
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:24,220
What I mean to say is
that we are looking for a boy

614
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:27,200
But can't find
a suitable match. Right?

615
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:32,960
So, I thought over it a lot
and came to a conclusion

616
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:36,820
So I called all of
them for their advise

617
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:38,840
You give your opinion

618
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:42,700
Now, let's not look for
a boy here and there

619
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,770
In present circumstances

620
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:46,870
I see only one man
in front of my eyes

621
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,390
And he's our priest

622
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,600
Yes!

623
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:51,700
What say?

624
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:53,650
We will ask him

625
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:57,640
If all of you agree we will
go to him and request him

626
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,920
I will speak to him

627
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,420
And if he agrees
everything will be fine

628
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:04,720
As you say

629
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,420
If that gentlemen agrees

630
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,280
then my daughter will have
a better life. - Yes

631
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,840
Thank you

632
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,410
Chief, you look after what to do

633
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:43,790
Yes, I will speak to him

634
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,430
Salutations.
- Salutations

635
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,210
Come, sit

636
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:52,030
Sit, chief.
- Yes

637
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:54,800
Salutations.
- Salutations

638
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,820
Sit

639
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,870
Sit

640
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,430
So, Balu,

641
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,760
did you find a groom?

642
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:18,200
Don't feel dejected

643
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:23,780
God is merciful. Have faith in Him

644
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:27,900
Priest. We've faith in Him
that's why we've come to you

645
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,930
Now, only you can do something

646
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:38,300
Yes, chief, I've sent information
to the nearby villages

647
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:41,750
We will get a match

648
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:46,720
I wanted to tell you
something different

649
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,930
Tell me, without hesitation

650
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:54,060
When you all have come together..

651
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:57,380
I understood
that the matter is different

652
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:03,490
Look, I will do anything I can.
Tell me

653
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,570
Only you can do this

654
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,530
I didn't get you

655
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,610
Chief, you tell him

656
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,290
Well... What... what do I say..

657
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,540
You see how it is, priest?

658
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,130
That even after so many efforts

659
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:29,780
we couldn't find a better match

660
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:36,190
And even if we find
any in a day or two

661
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:41,010
We can't trust this young generation

662
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:46,580
What if he refuse to
divorce after marriage?

663
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:53,700
So, we thought that..

664
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,540
you help us in this

665
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:08,240
See, everyone in
the village wants to unite them

666
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:16,470
And can we find a noble
man like you in this world?

667
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:22,550
So, we suggest

668
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,940
that you marry Halim

669
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,450
You lost the girl

670
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,690
I had told you to marry her

671
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,430
Now, sit and complain

672
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,700
Leave it. Why would anyone
take the burden on head?

673
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,310
Idiot. You'd have got
some fame in this way

674
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,370
For helping someone. What say?

675
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:47,450
Yes, of course

676
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:50,160
See, the priest is getting
praised everywhere

677
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,470
And look at you

678
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,950
Useless fellow. Remained useless

679
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:55,030
Leave it.
- Yes

680
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:58,010
Anyway you wouldn't be
able to do anything

681
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:01,480
Don't talk nonsense

682
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:04,080
Let me get married
once then you will see

683
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:06,970
Hey, who will give
you a girl like Halim?

684
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,490
Had you married her...
- What do you mean?

685
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:14,190
I will marry in this year only that
too with a better girl than Halim

686
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,940
Okay? And permanent

687
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:19,100
Otherwise, I will change my name

688
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,380
Alright then

689
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,990
Think of another name

690
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,410
Sister. Hey, sister

691
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:36,640
Where are you lost?
- Nowhere

692
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:41,120
Now, we will alone
have to stitch quilt

693
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,800
Come, brother-in-law. Sit. Come, sit

694
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,990
Brother-in-law. Are you sure you
are going to take away my sister?

695
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:57,760
Why?
- No, even I wanted to come

696
00:49:58,590 --> 00:49:59,490
Shall I come?

697
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:05,120
Coming

698
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:08,480
I will just come. You continue talk

699
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,370
But I want to come.
- So, come

700
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:14,980
After all, you're my sister-in-law

701
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:18,480
Coming

702
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:26,700
I was very scared.
- Why?

703
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,590
I thought if anyone else had agreed..

704
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:37,650
he would not have
left a wife like you

705
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:41,320
Then what would I have done?

706
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,970
But priest is a kind man

707
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:50,480
We will unite through that holy man

708
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,390
We will come together again

709
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,730
Don't worry

710
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:00,430
Why are you crying?

711
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,570
Don't worry. Everything will be fine

712
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:11,250
But how can I share a bed with
someone else other than you?

713
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:19,940
I want to live with you only

714
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,810
Can't we do anything else?

715
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,200
Go. Show this to girl
and ask her if she agrees

716
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:25,960
Mois, Son of Abdul Salam Ansari..

717
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:35,090
is getting married to you

718
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:43,540
You're getting Rs.151 cash

719
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:47,330
Do you accept him?

720
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,140
Yes

721
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:55,780
I accept him

722
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:06,020
Do you accept him?

723
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,440
Yes

724
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:10,980
I accept him

725
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:19,530
Do you accept him?

726
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:26,020
Yes

727
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,630
I accept him

728
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:24,300
Sheikh Balu, son of Akhar

729
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:26,990
has given his daughter Halim

730
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,820
to you in marriage,
in presence of the witnesses

731
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,220
Do you accept her?

732
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:37,920
Say that I accept. I agree

733
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:40,020
I've accepted and I agree

734
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,430
Her and her token amount

735
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:43,160
Her and her token amount

736
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:46,730
I accept and I agree

737
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:49,590
I accept and I agree

738
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,020
Come

739
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:15,030
Sit

740
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:31,370
I can understand your situation

741
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:39,960
But let me tell you
that I've done all this

742
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:43,180
for your and Kuddus' betterment

743
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:48,130
To reunite the two of you..

744
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:52,950
I've married you as per the rules

745
01:01:55,960 --> 01:02:06,130
And now,
we will have to follow this rule

746
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:16,080
As per the rule of 'Halal',
as a husband

747
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:21,510
I will have to spend at
least a night with you

748
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:31,020
Only then you will be able
to marry Kuddus again

749
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:33,530
as per the rules of Quran

750
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:37,820
And let me tell you..

751
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:43,730
I'm a strict follower
of Quran's rules

752
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:56,100
So, it is my duty that with you,
I must..

753
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:41,010
Come, aunt. I'm going.
Halim is sleeping

754
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,770
Priest, at least take some tea.
I will make it right away

755
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:47,850
No, aunt.
Serve tea to Halim when she wakes up

756
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:49,460
I'm going

757
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,970
Kuddus, are you going?
- Yes. I'm quite late

758
01:05:07,090 --> 01:05:11,110
Now, only three months.
Then you won't get late

759
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:12,420
Then

760
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:16,650
everything will
happen in time, right?

761
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:21,590
Look at his face. He's blushing.
- Yes, he is

762
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:27,900
Okay, I'm getting late. Bye

763
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:39,150
Why don't you get serious in life?

764
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:41,340
By God's grace,
your one daughter has

765
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:43,840
met with good fortune.
But we've two more daughters

766
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:45,400
We've to think about them

767
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:46,940
How long I shall drag
things all alone?

768
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:49,890
Why do you prate so much? Go

769
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:53,110
I'm there. Don't worry

770
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:56,330
I'm somehow running the house doing
household chores for people

771
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,310
Had I been depending on you
I'd be starving to death

772
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:01,080
Telling me not to worry

773
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,730
Child, finish everything quickly

774
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,790
Today we must supply
a quilt to Sharaja

775
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:08,450
Now, you're alone to do it,
okay? - Yes

776
01:06:09,370 --> 01:06:13,220
Child, finish it fast and help her.
I am going

777
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:21,660
Whatever you say, but Priest has
given a push to Halim's life

778
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:23,370
Yes, you're right

779
01:06:23,570 --> 01:06:25,470
Otherwise, she had no future

780
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:27,170
She'd have died single

781
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:29,670
And what would Balu do?

782
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:32,460
He has three daughters.
He's already lost in life

783
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:33,760
What will he do now?

784
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:37,680
Talk in simple language

785
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:40,210
He's always talking in
his profession's language

786
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:42,930
Look, my life has
passed in this shop

787
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:44,490
And I will die working here

788
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:46,680
So, people like if I use
my profession's language

789
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:49,350
No one will come to uplift me

790
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,430
I'm not that lucky

791
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:53,980
One should be lucky like Kuddus.
- Yes

792
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:56,080
He will get his once
divorced wife back. - Yes

793
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,640
What if someone else had
married her in this time?

794
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,300
Balu had another daughter then

795
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,920
Done repairing.
- What?

796
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:02,700
Your punctured wheel is repaired

797
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:08,890
Look, child. You're like my daughter

798
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,330
So, I will tell you something

799
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:13,060
But don't feel offended

800
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:17,490
Woman has to endure all this in life

801
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:23,530
But you're lucky that this
gentleman has supported you

802
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:27,450
He's a very kind person.
He's a man of religion

803
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:30,450
He will never be unjust to you

804
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:33,070
I know him from a long time

805
01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:36,080
Such people are rare to find

806
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,790
Don't think of anything

807
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:42,430
Whatever is happening
is for your good

808
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:44,930
If you make your mind
strong and endure a little

809
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,400
you will have a bright future

810
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:06,600
A month has passed to
your daughter's marriage, right?

811
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,640
Yes.
- Any news about her?

812
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:12,000
Not yet. Even her father
didn't go to the mosque

813
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:14,910
ever since her marriage.
He will go tomorrow

814
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:17,920
Then we will know.
- Everything will be fine

815
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:22,410
Priest is a kind person.
He's a man of religion

816
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:26,770
Yes. He's a gentleman

817
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:35,460
Hold it properly

818
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:45,040
Can't you hold it properly?
Where's your attention?

819
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:47,250
I can't hold it. Call sister

820
01:09:04,290 --> 01:09:06,240
Are you missing sister?

821
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:08,580
Shall we go to sister?

822
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:12,350
We will ask mother

823
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:15,210
Come, let's finish the work.
- Yes

824
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:40,500
Priest. Everything is fine

825
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,500
Thank God

826
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,280
God is merciful!

827
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:53,500
Son-in-law, you're lucky

828
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:59,360
Shall we proceed now?

829
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:00,500
Yes

830
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:04,660
Aunt, bring Halim out

831
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:52,670
Halim

832
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:56,280
In presence of the jury members

833
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:57,760
and in my complete sense..

834
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,560
I give you the first
'Talaq' (divorce)

835
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:14,790
Give me flatbread

836
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:23,470
It is God's grace
that everything is going on smoothly

837
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:27,440
Girl is really lucky

838
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:31,810
Mother we miss sister a lot

839
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:33,340
Even I miss her

840
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:35,420
But they say she's keeping good

841
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:39,190
Mother, shall Sahida and I go to her?
- Yes, mother

842
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:41,430
Even I don't like. Shall we go?

843
01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:44,160
Yes. Let the girls go

844
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,070
She will also feel better

845
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,060
And we will know
about her well being

846
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:49,480
When should we go?

847
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,100
The quilt stitching work is pending

848
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,820
Complete it and then go

849
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:57,270
Priest has given the first 'talaq'

850
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:01,140
Is everything else alright?
- Yes

851
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:03,960
I also met Halim

852
01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:09,210
You're lucky to get such a good wife

853
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:12,140
These days no woman
tolerates so much

854
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:15,950
And anyone else wouldn't
agree for all this

855
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,160
That's why I'm ready
to do anything for her

856
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:24,170
Only 2 months

857
01:12:25,070 --> 01:12:27,110
Let her tolerate for 2 months

858
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:29,280
Then see how I make her happy

859
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:31,120
Yes

860
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:03,070
Wow

861
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:07,870
The food is just like you

862
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:10,400
Awesome

863
01:13:13,130 --> 01:13:15,250
Kuddus is lucky

864
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:21,860
What's this?

865
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:24,060
Why aren't you eating?

866
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:28,030
You also eat with me.
Come on, take your plate

867
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,540
No, you eat. I will eat later

868
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:37,280
I will feel good if you eat with me

869
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:30,940
Brother.
It seems you've brought new cooker

870
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:32,730
You really care about your wife

871
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:35,310
It seems you've started
preparing for your new life

872
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:37,970
No, it's nothing like that

873
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:39,690
Actually, I didn't have it at home.
That's why.

874
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:41,440
What's the use even if you had any?

875
01:16:41,650 --> 01:16:43,830
Who was there to cook at home?

876
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:46,450
But now your wife will
come so you must bring it

877
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:51,330
So, when will you bring your wife?
- In a month or two

878
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:53,520
Don't worry. Everything will be fine

879
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:55,000
Yes

880
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:46,120
Hey... bring something
to arrange the utensils

881
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:50,950
Okay, I will

882
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,790
Today you came early
in the afternoon

883
01:19:52,290 --> 01:19:54,510
But I've yet not cooked food

884
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,000
And what's this?

885
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:00,720
Check it. It's for you

886
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:10,740
For me?

887
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,670
Did you like it?

888
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:13,710
Yes

889
01:21:15,190 --> 01:21:18,070
What must be my daughter doing?

890
01:21:19,090 --> 01:21:22,140
So many days have passed
but I haven't seen her

891
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:25,180
Mother, all the works are over

892
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:28,280
You had told us to go
once we finish this work

893
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:31,950
Yes. Before we take up another job,
you go

894
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:34,780
Seriously, mother?
- Yes

895
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:37,570
Go tomorrow

896
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,230
I will cook mutton for her

897
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:43,280
Give it to her

898
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:46,960
She loves it

899
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:04,440
Sahida!
- Sister

900
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:07,520
Vannu.
- Sister

901
01:22:08,530 --> 01:22:10,510
How are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?

902
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:12,940
Come inside. Sit

903
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:14,560
Sit

904
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:18,420
Sister, we miss you a lot

905
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:24,580
What are you looking at?

906
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:26,120
Sister.
- Yes

907
01:22:26,370 --> 01:22:28,270
You look very beautiful.
- Yes

908
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:32,330
You have also put on. Brother-in-law
will get mad to see you

909
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:34,970
Leave it. How's mother?

910
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:38,660
She misses you and cries at times

911
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:41,490
She has also made mutton for you

912
01:22:42,410 --> 01:22:44,070
Why did you spend so much?

913
01:22:44,150 --> 01:22:47,060
I get everything here.
He brings me anything I want

914
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:51,470
The house is really good.
- Yes

915
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:53,790
Everything is properly arranged

916
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:57,130
I've made it.
Looks nice, isn't it? - Yes

917
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:58,500
Sister.
- Yes

918
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:01,350
Brother-in-law had come.
He gave me sweets

919
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:02,850
He was asking about you

920
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:05,620
Brother-in-law said he has bought

921
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,840
all the kitchen accessories
and clothes for you

922
01:23:08,510 --> 01:23:10,960
See this. He brought this
saree for me. How's it?

923
01:23:11,930 --> 01:23:13,280
It's very pretty

924
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:15,890
He's very intelligent

925
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:20,160
And good too. He knows
everything about our religion

926
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:22,590
People come from long
distance to take his advice

927
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:25,260
And he thinks of
everyone's betterment

928
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:27,160
That's why he is doing
all this so that

929
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:29,140
you and brother-in-law
can live happily

930
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:32,590
Otherwise,
such people are never found. - Yes

931
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:36,700
Even if I make a mistake,
he never complains

932
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:39,480
Sister, you're very lucky

933
01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:43,230
Even your temporary
husband is so good

934
01:23:45,330 --> 01:23:47,470
But brother-in-law I also very good

935
01:23:49,370 --> 01:23:51,240
Come on, get fresh. Come

936
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:39,150
What happened?

937
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:48,830
Tomorrow, people will come

938
01:24:51,370 --> 01:24:53,470
I will give you
a second 'Talaq' tomorrow

939
01:24:58,170 --> 01:24:59,840
I'm scared..

940
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:04,480
if you've conceived due to me
then..

941
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:09,400
This should not happen

942
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:12,590
Nothing such will happen

943
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:15,990
Everything is alright

944
01:25:17,310 --> 01:25:18,450
Meaning?

945
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,350
Your menses?

946
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:33,870
Thank God

947
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:48,430
Priest, everything is fine

948
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:55,280
Bring Halim out.
- Yes

949
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,460
Girl has put on weight.
Seems well settled

950
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:38,970
What say, Balu?

951
01:26:41,470 --> 01:26:44,690
Priest. Start with your procedure

952
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:52,890
Halim. In presence
of the jury members..

953
01:26:54,370 --> 01:26:56,370
and in my complete sense..

954
01:27:00,350 --> 01:27:04,780
I give you the second
'Talaq' (divorce)

955
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:15,220
Bye.
- Bye

956
01:27:15,390 --> 01:27:16,660
Bye.
- Bye

957
01:27:17,370 --> 01:27:19,130
Bye.
- Bye

958
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:21,250
Only one month remain

959
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:28,930
Thanks, priest

960
01:27:30,270 --> 01:27:32,550
Everything is going on
smoothly all because of you

961
01:27:32,710 --> 01:27:34,780
I don't understand how
to repay your favours

962
01:27:35,610 --> 01:27:39,700
Balu, this is God's wish.
I'm just His child

963
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:45,410
I follow the path He has shown.
That's it

964
01:27:49,050 --> 01:27:50,000
Bye

965
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:51,190
Bye.
- Bye

966
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:11,890
The second 'talaq' is given
to Balu's daughter today

967
01:28:12,990 --> 01:28:15,900
Yes. But I still don't
understand one thing

968
01:28:16,370 --> 01:28:19,020
How come she has still not
conceived even after 2 months?

969
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:21,500
Priest is a gentleman

970
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,220
They must not have
crossed their limits

971
01:28:24,530 --> 01:28:26,930
If that happens then
the rule will not be followed

972
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:28,720
Meaning?

973
01:28:29,450 --> 01:28:31,100
There's a condition in our rule

974
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,070
They must consummate in marriage

975
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:39,240
But Priest strictly
follows religious rules

976
01:28:40,370 --> 01:28:41,810
Still the result is zero?

977
01:28:43,290 --> 01:28:45,270
It is strange.
- Strange?

978
01:28:45,870 --> 01:28:47,440
It's nothing like that

979
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:50,750
I think Halim has some flaws in her

980
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:54,440
She lived with her
husband for a year

981
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:55,840
Still she never conceived

982
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:58,900
It's good.
The divorce will happen easily

983
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:00,450
without any hurdle

984
01:29:00,530 --> 01:29:02,880
But if this is true
then what's the use of

985
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:05,170
Kuddus marrying Halim?

986
01:29:05,450 --> 01:29:07,380
First of all,
marry a non-virgin girl

987
01:29:07,670 --> 01:29:09,470
Moreover, she will not conceive

988
01:29:10,490 --> 01:29:12,570
Then why is he so desperate?

989
01:29:14,860 --> 01:29:16,310
Even this is true

990
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:22,980
That's okay.
But you know what I feel?

991
01:29:23,390 --> 01:29:25,230
Shall I tell you?
- Yes

992
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:28,020
What if the priest
wouldn't divorce her?

993
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:29,510
Are you mad?

994
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:31,020
Why do you talk nonsense?

995
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:33,140
Will this be possible?

996
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:35,390
Look, the priest is a gentleman

997
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:38,880
No matter what
but he will keep his word. - Yes

998
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,790
But what if he will not?

999
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:43,690
Why are you defaming that gentleman?

1000
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:47,070
Oh... you're getting very excited

1001
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:49,610
Take for instance,
if the priest wouldn't divorce her

1002
01:29:49,690 --> 01:29:51,080
then what will you do?

1003
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:52,850
Idiot, jinx

1004
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:56,010
He never speak good about anyone

1005
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:57,760
Hey, why do you fight?

1006
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:01,100
They are enjoying
and you people are jealous

1007
01:30:01,390 --> 01:30:03,700
Look at this idiot.
- You're an idiot

1008
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:07,310
Let the priest not divorce
her and then I will see you

1009
01:30:08,790 --> 01:30:10,700
Look at his behavior.
- Leave it

1010
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:17,490
No. Priest should divorce her

1011
01:30:25,290 --> 01:30:27,500
Do not divorce me

1012
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:33,050
I can't live without you

1013
01:30:37,990 --> 01:30:39,320
Don't think like that

1014
01:30:45,470 --> 01:30:47,700
Even I've started liking you but..

1015
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:56,850
I had already told you

1016
01:30:57,290 --> 01:31:00,600
that I strictly
follow religious rules

1017
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:07,860
I teach people to follow this path

1018
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:12,010
I can't do this

1019
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:26,660
But I can't live without you

1020
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:39,600
Look, Halim

1021
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:42,000
Don't say this

1022
01:31:43,190 --> 01:31:44,780
This is a crime

1023
01:31:48,610 --> 01:31:50,560
From past 3 months

1024
01:31:51,410 --> 01:31:53,500
I'm claiming my right
of a husband on you

1025
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:58,250
Now, if your menses stops
and if you conceive..

1026
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:03,360
then there will be a problem

1027
01:32:06,930 --> 01:32:09,210
Kuddus' dreams will shatter

1028
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:13,280
He's a kind hearted person

1029
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,440
I can't betray him

1030
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:20,320
I can't betray your father

1031
01:32:24,490 --> 01:32:26,580
The entire village is looking at us

1032
01:32:29,270 --> 01:32:34,460
I've married you so that people
would follow the path

1033
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:37,750
suggested in Islam

1034
01:32:39,850 --> 01:32:42,410
If I do this, then..

1035
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:46,410
people will lose their faith

1036
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:54,250
It's better..

1037
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:01,170
that your menses starts

1038
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:06,860
The 'iddat' (waiting)
period passes safely

1039
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:13,760
And..

1040
01:33:14,870 --> 01:33:16,380
once again..

1041
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:23,990
you settle down with Kuddus

1042
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:27,770
You're so learned

1043
01:33:29,030 --> 01:33:31,370
People listen to you

1044
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:35,270
You explain them

1045
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:38,690
Please, do something

1046
01:33:49,650 --> 01:33:52,250
See, this is queen. Queen of king

1047
01:33:52,810 --> 01:33:53,830
Take it

1048
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:57,530
But the sir is taking away the queen.
What about that?

1049
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:58,700
Meaning?

1050
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:01,250
This time the priest
will belong to the queen

1051
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:03,980
Are you mad?
- Mad?

1052
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:06,670
This time Halim will conceive
and she will belong to

1053
01:34:06,820 --> 01:34:10,010
priest and not the king

1054
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:11,920
Impossible.
- Impossible?

1055
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,260
Take my word

1056
01:34:13,590 --> 01:34:14,920
Do you bet?
- Done

1057
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,260
I bet for 100 Rs

1058
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:20,780
If Halim conceives,
you will give me Rs.200

1059
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:22,500
Even I bet Rs.100

1060
01:34:22,580 --> 01:34:25,360
If she wouldn't conceive
then you will give me Rs.300

1061
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:28,280
Keep the money ready

1062
01:34:28,450 --> 01:34:30,770
I will see to it
how she wouldn't conceive

1063
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:19,440
Salutations

1064
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:20,750
Salutations

1065
01:35:23,190 --> 01:35:26,580
Hey, open the door.
Give water to son-in-law

1066
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:29,090
Yes.
- No, no need of water

1067
01:35:29,610 --> 01:35:31,880
Come on, we've to go.
It's getting late. - Yes

1068
01:35:32,170 --> 01:35:34,290
Let's go.
Sahida, come here

1069
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:37,730
You love sweets, right?
- Yes

1070
01:35:37,950 --> 01:35:39,850
I've brought it for you

1071
01:35:41,330 --> 01:35:42,900
You eat it since childhood, right?

1072
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:49,080
Salutations.

Sit.
- Sit

Aunt

1077
01:37:03,470 --> 01:37:06,570
Is everything alright?
- Everything is fine

1078
01:37:08,590 --> 01:37:10,230
So, bring Halim out

1079
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:11,310
Yes

1080
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:41,610
Priest, everything has
gone smoothly till date

1081
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:45,200
So, let's proceed

1082
01:37:55,290 --> 01:37:56,950
Priest

1083
01:38:21,790 --> 01:38:22,730
Halim

1084
01:38:27,550 --> 01:38:29,670
In presence of the jury members..

1085
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:33,990
and in my complete sense..

1086
01:38:34,070 --> 01:38:35,070
Stop

1087
01:38:39,050 --> 01:38:43,320
I request you. Don't divorce me

1088
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:47,000
Don't divorce me

1089
01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:52,330
Hey.. hey,
what are you saying, child?

1090
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:55,810
What else do I say, uncle?
You tell me

1091
01:38:56,820 --> 01:38:59,190
You people have made a toy of me

1092
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:01,600
A toy

1093
01:39:03,150 --> 01:39:05,430
One is satisfied,
the second one can use

1094
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:09,130
and if done with the second one,
return to the first one

1095
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:12,870
Do I have a personal identity or not?

1096
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:16,750
I'm getting stifled in your rules

1097
01:39:17,490 --> 01:39:20,390
You people can't think
of anything beyond this

1098
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:23,420
Child, what are you blabbering?

1099
01:39:23,650 --> 01:39:25,330
Are you out of your mind?

1100
01:39:25,410 --> 01:39:28,980
Not me, but all of you
are out of your mind

1101
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:35,320
You're my mother

1102
01:39:35,980 --> 01:39:38,250
You're my mother

1103
01:39:39,850 --> 01:39:42,800
You should have known my plight

1104
01:39:45,380 --> 01:39:46,650
But no

1105
01:39:47,610 --> 01:39:50,210
And what could you have done?

1106
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:54,280
After all, you're also a woman

1107
01:39:56,090 --> 01:39:58,310
No one would have listened to you

1108
01:39:58,770 --> 01:40:00,310
And all of you

1109
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:03,330
You think you all are
very smart, right?

1110
01:40:04,780 --> 01:40:10,880
But has anyone ever thought
about how I must have felt?

1111
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:13,870
Has anyone ever thought of it?

1112
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:22,920
Child, all this is happening
as per the religious rules

1113
01:40:23,150 --> 01:40:25,620
And we're doing this
for your happiness

1114
01:40:25,870 --> 01:40:29,610
What happiness, uncle? Tell me

1115
01:40:30,690 --> 01:40:32,810
If I had eloped with someone

1116
01:40:32,890 --> 01:40:34,970
you people would have killed me

1117
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:39,240
You all are doing the same even now

1118
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:44,640
You people have killed my conscience

1119
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:49,420
You people have killed my conscience

1120
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:51,370
What nonsense are you blabbering?

1121
01:40:51,570 --> 01:40:54,590
We all have come here for you.
For your betterment

1122
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:56,980
Yes, they have.
All of them have come

1123
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:59,690
But they've come for
the entertainment

1124
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:02,990
No one has guts to stand against it

1125
01:41:03,070 --> 01:41:05,120
and say that this is wrong

1126
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:12,610
My father got me married
for the first time

1127
01:41:13,890 --> 01:41:16,310
He didn't ask for my opinion

1128
01:41:19,370 --> 01:41:21,590
My husband divorced me

1129
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:25,300
He didn't ask for my opinion

1130
01:41:26,370 --> 01:41:27,730
All of you..

1131
01:41:28,070 --> 01:41:30,950
All of you got me remarried

1132
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:34,400
But no one asked for my opinion

1133
01:41:34,810 --> 01:41:37,170
Now, even he's ready to divorce me

1134
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:41,250
Even he didn't ask for my opinion

1135
01:41:42,910 --> 01:41:46,350
And now all of you want to get
me married for the third time

1136
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:49,190
No one asked for my opinion

1137
01:41:51,190 --> 01:41:55,120
Hey... don't do this

1138
01:41:56,050 --> 01:41:57,780
Don't do this

1139
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:03,130
Has anyone thought about
how I must be feeling?

1140
01:42:08,050 --> 01:42:11,000
My mind is already been raped

1141
01:42:11,570 --> 01:42:12,840
Hey, girl, it's not like that

1142
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,410
It's already raped...
- It's nothing like that

1143
01:42:14,490 --> 01:42:15,500
Control yourself

1144
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:16,920
Control yourself

1145
01:42:17,130 --> 01:42:19,840
Look, this poor fellow is
doing everything for your love

1146
01:42:20,010 --> 01:42:21,200
This is going on for you

1147
01:42:21,570 --> 01:42:23,720
He had come to take me away. Right?

1148
01:42:23,970 --> 01:42:25,930
If he had strongly
opposed everything

1149
01:42:26,010 --> 01:42:28,350
and taken me away,
he'd be a true man

1150
01:42:29,730 --> 01:42:31,740
Even he joined hands with you

1151
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:34,930
Are you convinced
with all this, uncle?

1152
01:42:35,250 --> 01:42:37,520
Tell me.
- No

1153
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,160
I am not convinced

1154
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:43,830
If it was my daughter,
I'd have sent her with her husband

1155
01:42:44,130 --> 01:42:46,640
happily and blessed
her for a happy life

1156
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:50,790
But this is your religious rule.
We can't do anything in this

1157
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:55,170
And what's the use if
I'm convinced or not

1158
01:42:55,380 --> 01:42:56,670
It is a religious matter

1159
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:59,650
Can we interfere in each
other religious matters?

1160
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:02,180
Take the name of religion and escape

1161
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:03,280
Hey..

1162
01:43:03,650 --> 01:43:05,240
All of you will keep quiet

1163
01:43:05,490 --> 01:43:09,260
But stand up for
the sake of humanity

1164
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:13,330
Can't you think injustice
is happening with me?

1165
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,090
I beg of you

1166
01:43:17,850 --> 01:43:19,480
Don't do this

1167
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:23,080
Don't be so atrocious to
your daughters and mothers

1168
01:43:23,910 --> 01:43:25,130
Don't do it

1169
01:43:26,110 --> 01:43:27,340
Don't do it

1170
01:43:32,890 --> 01:43:34,060
Look, chief

1171
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:36,710
This is her side of the story

1172
01:43:37,430 --> 01:43:40,260
Of course, she is correct

1173
01:43:41,460 --> 01:43:43,960
But we must do our duty

1174
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:47,890
Priest has given his words

1175
01:43:48,870 --> 01:43:51,740
So only Kuddus have right on Halim

1176
01:43:53,830 --> 01:43:58,060
Priest, you follow
the rule and divorce her

1177
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:14,350
Halim

1178
01:44:17,670 --> 01:44:19,650
In my complete sense..

1179
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:25,960
and in presence of
the jury members

1180
01:44:26,610 --> 01:44:27,860
I give you final..

1181
01:44:36,610 --> 01:44:39,460
If you divorce Halim..

1182
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:45,170
then also I will not marry her

1183
01:44:46,150 --> 01:44:47,900
What are you saying, son-in-law?

1184
01:44:48,910 --> 01:44:50,640
Why are you taking her seriously?

1185
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:52,710
She's naïve

1186
01:44:54,350 --> 01:44:55,860
Not she..

1187
01:44:58,310 --> 01:45:00,000
but we're naïve

1188
01:45:03,050 --> 01:45:04,140
I'm naïve

1189
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,990
I divorced my wife in anger

1190
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:13,590
This rule is made in our religion..

1191
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:16,280
to punish a husband like me

1192
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:18,860
who divorces his wife any
moment without a reason

1193
01:45:21,700 --> 01:45:24,250
Then why Halim should suffer
from my part of the punishment?

1194
01:45:28,670 --> 01:45:30,870
And where am I going through
the punishment in all this?

1195
01:45:34,830 --> 01:45:36,970
But now I must go through it

1196
01:45:40,030 --> 01:45:41,370
I will go through it

1197
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:46,730
I request you, priest

1198
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:51,510
Don't divorce Halim

1199
01:45:56,540 --> 01:45:58,860
Her happiness is in your hands now

1200
01:46:09,690 --> 01:46:10,590
Halim

1201
01:46:13,630 --> 01:46:16,570
I will not let you
suffer for my mistakes

1202
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:19,630
Forgive me
