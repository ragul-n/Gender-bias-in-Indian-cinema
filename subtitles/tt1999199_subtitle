He'll make Jhola Ramani wait.

The entire world is after me
and he'll make me wait.

127
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,274
He hasn't given file of Mehta and
Mehta. Where the hell is he?

What is it? -Sir, it's
string of shirt. Look.

150
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:44,326
This is not a college, but a
corporate office of a big finance company.

151
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:45,461
You must be dressed properly here.

152
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:50,331
Wear sober clothes. Like
a proper executive.

153
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:51,376
Learn from him, Vicky.

154
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,345
First you learn to come
to office on time.

155
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,472
Or l'll have to shift my
office in your house.

00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,308
lt'll be close to my
house. -And mine too.

The office will be in
your house. -Yeah !

Yes, sir. -You fell from the bike
and your trousers were torn.

161
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:16,459
You were here, so how did you
know he fell from the bike?

162
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,270
Sir, look at his face.
He looks so lowly.

163
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:25,307
l've tied a ponytail.
But l'm not stupid.

164
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,402
So are you crazy?

165
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,474
Shut up, friend !

You've been slapped for
the first time in life.

170

And l get slapped more
often than l eat food.

171
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,432
Now that you've been slapped once,
you'll keep getting it.

172

Thief! -Thief!

192

They both are hands in gloves.

00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,358
Come. Come.

194
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,458
Stop. Where are you going?
-You want bag. -Yes.

195
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:05,403
lt's their racket. One friend
steals and other supports. .

196
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,405
Madam. Take your bag.

197
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,464
Where is the thief? -You
wanted him too.

198
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,409
l mean. . he escaped.

199
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,309
He escaped or did you
make him flee? -What?

200
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:20,443
Listen, these are old fashion
tricks to woo a girl.

201
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,378
Why don't you try something new?

202
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,422
And listen, l'm not
like those girls. .

203
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,355
. .who come to Mumbai for this.

204
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,256
l'm a decent girl from
a decent family. Ok?

205
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,295
So don't try to be over-smart.

206
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:46,470
What a slap! l heard
it till there.

207
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,415
Friend, l too have loved.

208
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,308
But l've never snatched anyone's
income for love.

209
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,319
lt would've been better if you
would've let me take the bag.

210
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:58,288
Never mind. Take my business card.

211
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,416
Keep it. lf you need me, phone me.

212
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,455
And apply ointment at
night. lt'll heal.

213
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:07,397
Hi. -Chameli ! My girlfriend.
Chameli.

214
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:13,269
Can l say something,
Aditya? -Go on, pal.

215
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,377
Why do l feel that she's
used to slapping. .

216
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,379
. .and you to getting slapped?

217
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,471
Shut up, friend !

218
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:28,285
l don't rue getting slapped, but
that she misunderstands me.

219
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:31,414
Then let's go and explain it
to her. -But where and how?

220
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,383
What's her name? -Riya.

221
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,324
Let's go and find Riya.

222

We don't have the address. -We'll
find the address. Come.

223
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,301
What's her name? -Riya.

224
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,464
All the Riya's on Orkut
will be out.

225
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,342
l mean to say, their profile.

226
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,411
But how can you be sure that
she'll be on Orkut?

227
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:54,434
-But she might be.

228
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,338
Yeah ! Let's try.

229
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,382
Where does she work?

Wow! This old lady.

232
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,291
She's for you. She's not the one.

233
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,489
She's my Riya. Yes.

234
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,356
She's hot. -Shut up!

235
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,434
l mean to say. . don't just stare.

236

Express your feelings.
Send her a message.

237
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:27,301
Oh ! 'Hi, this is Aditya.
Recognized me?'

238
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:33,478
'You had slapped twice on
my one cheek with love.'

239
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,445
One more message.

240
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:41,448
'l want to say that l'm not
like what you think.'

241

l've recognized you properly.

242

Vicky is never wrong. -lt's here.

243
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:50,325
What has she written?

244
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:55,306
lf you send me message again,
l had just slapped you now. .

245
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,501
. .you can't even imagine
what l'll do next.

246
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,436
You're not a friend, but a ghost.

247
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,313
A Dracula that's
sucking my blood.

248
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:07,384
lf you can't solve a problem,
don't aggravate it. Please.

249
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,353
l've. . -Stop. Stop it.

250
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,416
You know, she used to think
l'm partially bad.

251
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,452
But because of your stupid idea. .

252
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,454
. .she thinks l'm totally immoral.

253
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,329
Can l say something? -No.

254
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,426
lmportant. . -No.

255
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,462
Once. . -Quiet! l say quiet.

256
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:32,377
Vicky, our hero was so
happy till yesterday. .

257
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,379
. .and today he has long face.

258
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,382
Actually our hero was
in love before. .

259
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,352
. .but now he's heart broken.

260
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:46,290
Why do you worry? l know
how to change his mood.

261
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:49,417
With grilled crab. -Waiter?

262
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,455
Vicky, this voice is familiar.

263
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,392
Yes, madam. -Listen.

264
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:59,404
Listening? -When l ordered crab,
you said it's not there.

265
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:00,427
How did you get it now?

266
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,297
Riya. -From sea. -What?

267
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,245
She's the same girl who
slapped you? -Yes.

268
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:12,281
They'd signed it earlier. lt
got released now. -What?

269
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,285
Oh ! l mean they had ordered
on the phone.

270
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,311
l don't know. l came here earlier
so l want the crab.

271
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,289
Should l give birth to crab now. .

272
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,416
-No ifs and buts. Go quickly.

273
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,324
l'll be back. -Wait.

274
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,387
Had it been Chalandhar, l would've
taught him a lesson.

275
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:29,300
Excuse me, Miss Slap. .
Riya. Miss Riya.

276
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,368
You can take the crab. -You?

277
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,472
Yes. -So you came here
following me.

278
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,366
And you want to be a hero
by offering crab.

279
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:38,398
You're getting me wrong again.

280
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,468
l don't want to know you.
-But listen to me.

281
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,275
Shut up!

282
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,473
First scrap, then crab.
-Look, you. .

283
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,310
Didn't l say that these are
old tricks to woo girls?

284
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,447
Move. Don't mess with me.

285
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,389
Miss Riya, yours. . Listen.

286
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,324
l think he'll get slapped again.

287
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:57,292
Riya. Riya. Listen.

288
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,365
Listen to me. -l think you won't
give up so easily. -Yes.

289
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,296
Why should l?

290
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,358
lf someone thinks wrong about
you, do you give up?

291
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,427
Listen. l know you properly. Ok?

292
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,430
That's the problem. Listen.

293
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,398
You misunderstand me.

294
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:12,500
Riya, please give me a chance
to prove that l'm not wrong.

295
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,377
l'm not a bad boy. Riya, please.

296
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,282
l promise, after that you
won't see me again.

297
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,409
But l'm not interested. Ok?

298
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,385
Ok. But you're interested
in slapping me.

299
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:26,423
You can slap me, but you
won't listen to me.

300
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,357
Riya, please.

301
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:30,483
l'm warning you.

302
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:34,465
lf you don't listen to me, l'll
haunt you like a ghost.

303
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,495
Please. Please.

304
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,430
Please, Riya.

305
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,507
Tell me. -Not now.

306
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,368
Tomorrow. At the same
place and same time.

307
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,405
And l'll order 2 crabs
this time. Ok?

308
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:54,280
Will you come? -l'll
think about it.

309
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:57,379
Aditya, forget her.

310
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,358
You can't woo her. Let's
find someone else.

311
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,353
No, only Riya will be in my life.

312
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,328
So you'll always stay a bachelor.

313
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:14,432
-lf violence and not finance had been
my business, l'd have killed them today.

314
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:17,399
God knows where they are!

315
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,504
We're here, sir. -You've come.

316
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,508
Where were you? -Sir,
don't ask that.

317
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,409
Ask what did we do.
-What did you do?

318
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:31,345
Sir, we've just enticed a girl's
heart. -What are you saying?

319
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,425
What rubbish ! -Don't
stop me, friend.

320
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,386
Sir, no matter what
l'll say it. -Yes.

321
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,430
A foreign returned
priest had told. .

322
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,329
. .me once, l'll kill a person.

323
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:44,426
l think he was wrong. l'll
kill not one, but two men.

324
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:49,330
Ok, sir. Kill us and kill
your last hope too.

325
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:53,308
Meaning? -l mean we'll meet her.

326
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:57,405
Who? -The girl to start love saga.

327
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:00,282
Just think, when on
her fair cheeks. .

328
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,445
. .you'll kiss with
your black lips. .

329
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,388
l mean to say you'll kiss
her with your hot lips. .

330
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,383
But whom will l kiss.

331
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,289
Tanya.

332
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,420
Really? -Yes.

333
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:14,356
No. You're trying to fool me.

334
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,333
No, sir. l swear by your ponytail.

335
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,403
Sir, we praised you a
lot in front of her.

336
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,302
Really? -Yes. -What did she say?

337
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:21,361
What could she say?

338
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,467
Did you see well going
to a thirsty man? -No.

339
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,379
Thirsty man has to go to the well.

340
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,315
But she's strange. She never
asked me for water.

341
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,444
Often l stand at the reception
for no reason.

342
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,314
Often l call her in my cabin.

343
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:42,460
But l can't express my feelings.

344
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:46,329
Shame! l mean you must
be feeling shy.

345
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:51,258
Remember. Girls often say
no in place of yes.

346
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,427
But this is a difficult case.

347
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:56,271
Girl is below 25 and
boy is above 55.

348
00:22:56,475 --> 00:23:02,311
Don't worry. Even on old
buildings, new flags are hoisted.

349
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:05,316
But it is done just once a
year. On independence day.

350
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,443
How will that help me?
-Sir, we're here.

351
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,351
We'll arrange something.

352
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:12,423
But don't tell her that
we'd told you all this.

353
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,383
Ok. Ok.

354
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,382
Why did you phone?

355
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,452
l've sanctioned Kishanchand's
loan. -What?

356
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,328
Get his papers. l'll sign them.

357
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,457
But they didn't submitted
important papers.

358
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,398
-But gave me sweets.

359
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:25,403
Don't be surprised. He's
my personal friend.

360
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:28,270
lt's my personal matter. l've
sanctioned it. That's final.

361
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,341
Crook. -You called me crook.

362
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:33,411
How dare you call me crook!

363
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:38,315
sir, l didn't say it. Tanya
says so. When she's alone.

364
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:42,513
Ok. -She says with grace and
shyness and jerking her tresses. .

365
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,423
. .that you're a crook.

366
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,283
Crook is such a sweet pet name.

367
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,397
Even my dad used to
say that with love.

368
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,366
And l used to sit on his lap.

369
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,492
You're so cute.

370
00:23:57,302 --> 00:24:01,398
You never know. Even Tanya
might sit in my lap. .

371
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,369
Riya. Who is Aditya?

372
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,405
Why do you care? Come here.

373
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,307
l've cooked butter chicken.

374
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:15,409
But tell me, who is Aditya?

375
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:20,390
Konika, there are many
Aditya's who. .

376
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,450
. .want to take girls on a ride.

377
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:26,421
He must be one of them who
is chasing me. -And you?

378
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:28,458
You know l'm here to
achieve something.

379
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,392
Then do it.

380
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,463
l mean the boy is handsome.

381
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:36,340
Give him my mobile number. Ok?

382
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:41,369
Tomorrow he's going to prove his
decency. l'll do it them.

383
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:44,439
Ok? l'm famished now. -Butter
chicken. l want it too.

384
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,377
Did you get it? l want to
get rid of that girl.

385
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:51,286
Sir, that's a great idea.

386
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:57,261
l'll mix something in a cake
and she won't see you again.

387
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,322
Will there be any problem? -No.

388
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:06,335
Even it happens, you'll
be in troubel, not me.

389
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:08,498
Hero!

390
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,501
You're Aditya. But you look
so distressed. Why?

391
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,268
You must be wondering
if you love. .

392
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:16,280
. .story will start today or not.

393
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:18,348
Yes. l don't know if
she'll come today.

394
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:21,350
And if she comes, how will l
tell her what's in my heart.

395
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,322
Don't fear, when l'm near.

396
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:31,319
l'll give you an idea to take your
love story to its climax.

397
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,457
Meaning? -Do you see
that boy in glasses?

398
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,289
He gave me an idea.

399
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:40,361
He wants to ger rid of a glass
and you want to befriend one.

400
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:44,499
Correct. -So we'll use his
idea and change it.

401
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:46,467
But what's the idea?

402
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,342
Listen. -Yes.

403
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:54,349
What are you doing? -l was
just checking your ear.

404
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:56,477
Tell me. Stop kidding. -Yes.

405
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:03,318
But will there be any problem.

406
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,295
No.

407
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:10,391
Even it happens, you'll
be in troubel, not me.

408
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,440
Hi, Riya. -Hi.

What will you have? -l don't want

412
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:40,264
Hello. -Hello, sweety. My

'What? She has a boyfriend.'

420
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:11,395
Listen. l've heard
a news on radio.

421
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:19,328
A boy called a girl for lunch to
tell her how decent he was.

422
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:21,405
Ok? -Yes, child.

423
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,367

Then? -Do you know he missed
drug in girl's food.

426
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,289
For hero. For specky.

427
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,317
Don't ask what happened.

428
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:48,330
Don't worry. l know how to deal
with such people, dad.

429
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:52,268
Your dad. -Yes.

430

What? -Yes.

461

For the first time a boy
has entered my heart.

Tell me, why did you
come to Mumbai?

482
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,309
We've everything by
the grace of God.

483
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,402
But l told dad that l'll go
to Mumbai and get success.

484
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,480
And chose my own life partner.

485

Really? So what type of a
life partner do you want?

486
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,344

Stop kidding. -Life is

Now what to do? -First take entry.

lt's the same.

994
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:27,489
Do you think we'll find Riya.

l don't know.

996
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:35,426
But if we keep looking for her
like this, we'll be lost.

997
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:38,501
Look at me. l've become unhealthy.

998
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:40,434

999
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:44,242
-Yes. ln Punjab you used

00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:03,295
l don't like to eat anything if
there is no chicken or meat.

1005
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:08,232
l don't like veg plant.
-l too don't like it.

1006

But we're helpless. So eat it.

Yes. But what?

1008
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:13,468

if l get such food daily.

01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:15,272
l'll become slim.

01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:18,447
That's good. l'll save money
on gym. -Shut up!

1011
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,250
Mr. Rustom should've told us
that this is a veg society.

1012
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:23,316
lt's not his fault, but ours.

1013
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:26,420
Fearing your dad, we bought
flat in a hurry.

1014
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:29,515
Don't bring dad in the middle.
Ok? -Ok, relax.

1015
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,429
Listen. l've an idea. -Go on.

1016
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:35,497
We can go out and
eat non-veg food.

1017
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:37,431
We sure can.

1018
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:41,426
But what if dad comes home
and ask for non-veg food?

1019
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,441
Sir, bill. -What for?

1149
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:20,461
She's on a leave. So she
called me to the garden.

1150
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:25,290
Why you? -She'll first

01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:30,289
Did he say so? -Yes.

1168
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:34,232
That's the starting point from
where he went to the fair.

1169
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:35,429
lt's an inauspicious place.

1170
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:37,496
Anyone can get lost
from here. -What?

1171
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:42,404
Don't worry. You'll find
your girl. Look for her.

Where is the chicken?

1361
01:20:55,383 --> 01:20:56,441
Let me see what it is.

1362
01:20:57,485 --> 01:20:59,248
l can't see anything.

1363
01:21:00,388 --> 01:21:04,381
Earlier l smelled egg, now
l can smell chicken.

1364
01:21:06,428 --> 01:21:09,397
Badbad, did you eat chicken? -Yes.

1365
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:11,295
Yes? -No.

1366
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:15,392
So why do you smell

l got it now.

1373
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:38,448
lt means someone else besides us
eat non-veg. -You're right.

1374
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:45,231
lf others eat non-veg in this
society, they would cook too.

1375
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:47,424
So we can cook non-veg.

1376
01:21:50,338 --> 01:21:52,499
Riya, my tiffin. -lt's
there. Take it.

No, sir. -Give it to me, Thakur.

1402
01:23:09,351 --> 01:23:11,410
Sir, he's Aditya, not Thakur.

1403
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:13,510
l know, it was a dialogue.
-No, sir.

01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:44,340
You're scum.

1414
01:23:44,419 --> 01:23:49,447
You work in a big company
but bring apple for lunch.

1415
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:52,451
Sir, l had said it wasn't
fit for you. -Yes.

1416
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:55,360

01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:14,210
Riya said that to me.

1424
01:24:14,315 --> 01:24:17,341
lf chicken is not here,
where is it? -Oh no!

1425

l'm sorry, Adi. l've erred.

1426
01:24:28,496 --> 01:24:32,489
No, l've erred by not stopping
you from making non-veg.

1427
01:24:34,469 --> 01:24:35,493
What will happen now?

1428
01:24:36,337 --> 01:24:39,363
What else? Pack up for us. -What?

1429
01:24:39,507 --> 01:24:42,408
Chintu would've told Chaturvedi.

He'll be here to throw us out.

1431

l think he's here. -Go and look.

1432
01:24:54,389 --> 01:24:56,414

1478
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:24,497
And l'll 'book' the money
you've paid so far.

1479
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:28,375
You mean you'll return

1482
01:27:40,355 --> 01:27:47,386
lt means Riya and her husband
fooled me. Come.

01:27:48,463 --> 01:27:52,331
Vicky, time is short. Uncle
Rustom is asking for money.

1484
01:27:52,467 --> 01:27:54,230
That builder is delaying.

1485

01:28:52,527 --> 01:28:56,327
Look, l've got a job by
fake certificates.

1503
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:58,399
Why do you want to get
me fired? l'm going.

l can't sanction this
loan. -Why not?

1524
01:30:01,329 --> 01:30:02,489
All the papers and documents

Yes, but some papers
are missing. -Ok.

1526

You fellow! Don't be angry.

1531
01:30:23,518 --> 01:30:26,385
Young boys shouldn't

Ok, l'll sanction it.

Aren't you ashamed? l'm

1547
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:24,375
But he said that you're ready.

Yes, go on. -Brother, your land
is in non-development zone.

1554
01:31:52,373 --> 01:31:55,342
No builder can make building

Not just you, even l've
suffered lost. Bye.

Dad. -Don't call me dad, liar.

But what happened?
-You lied to me.

What? -That this is your flat.

1560

That my daughter is happy.

1561
01:32:44,325 --> 01:32:46,225
l've raised Riya with love.

1562
01:32:47,395 --> 01:32:51,422
l knew she has erred
by marrying you.

1563
01:32:51,532 --> 01:32:54,365
Sir, Jalandhar radio.
-Turn it off.

You acted stubbornly.

1566

l had seen many great boys
for you in Jalandhar.

1567
01:33:05,513 --> 01:33:11,281
But you liked him who
is a big liar.

No, dad. Actually. . -My foot!

l had to see this day.

1570
01:33:20,328 --> 01:33:23,297
My own kids mocked me.

1571
01:33:24,265 --> 01:33:27,496
You've broken my heart. Really?

1572
01:33:28,469 --> 01:33:30,437
You've really sadden your dad.

1573
01:33:31,472 --> 01:33:34,305
l can't stay here. Come, Sidhu.

1574
01:33:34,342 --> 01:33:35,400
Kadu, uncle. -Come.

1575
01:33:35,476 --> 01:33:37,376
Dad. Listen to me. Please.

1576
01:33:37,411 --> 01:33:39,345
There is nothing to say.

1577

We've erred. Forgive
me. l'm sorry.

1578

Are you fine? Riya.

Don't be tense. God is great!

He's giving you some
trouble in life.

1587

But everything will

Don't say such thin in
vegetarian society.

1600
01:34:56,390 --> 01:34:58,324
You'll be in trouble.

01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:15,509
Dad would've been so happy
if he were here.

1605
01:35:17,344 --> 01:35:20,313
Don't worry. l promise.
l'll get him myself.

Ok? Smile. Smile.

1607
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:27,513
What did the builder say? -That. .

Forget it.

1609
01:35:30,491 --> 01:35:32,425
You're hiding it from me. -No.

1610
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:35,293
Just forget it. -Just tell
me. What did he say?

1611
01:35:38,332 --> 01:35:40,323
He refused. -What?

1612
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:46,497
He says our house is in
non-development zone.

1613
01:35:48,509 --> 01:35:50,374
What will we do, Adi?

1614
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:56,375
Desire for a flat has brought
our lives on this turn.

1615
01:35:57,518 --> 01:35:59,349
lt's because of me.

1616
01:36:00,387 --> 01:36:02,355

Give it to Mr. Rustom and
ask for some more time.

1619
01:36:12,366 --> 01:36:14,459
Don't worry. l'll talk
to him in the morning.

1620
01:36:15,402 --> 01:36:17,233
We'll find a way out.

Chaturvedi, l brought you here
to talk to you in private.

1623
01:36:31,519 --> 01:36:34,511
Tell me. -Why didn't you give
me flat in this building?

1624
01:36:35,422 --> 01:36:36,480
Because you're a non-vegetarian.

1625

Who? -Aditya Kher.

1630
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:51,404
l don't believe it. -Why?

1631
01:36:51,505 --> 01:36:53,473
Because l know him
for so many days.

1632
01:36:54,375 --> 01:36:56,240
For just one and a half month.

1633

And he roams with 2
eggs in his pocket.

Boiled egg. You say you know him.

1638
01:37:15,429 --> 01:37:17,329
Do you've any proof?

l'm spying on him. l'll
get evidence soon.

1643
01:37:34,281 --> 01:37:37,250
Come to me with evidence.

1644
01:37:37,351 --> 01:37:42,482
l promise, that day
l'll evict Aditya.

1645
01:37:43,357 --> 01:37:44,449
What? -Evict.

1646

You're a secretary of a big tower.

1650
01:37:52,466 --> 01:37:55,230
Speak a language which the
members can understand.

1651
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:00,366
l don't believe it. Wait a minute.

1652
01:38:01,475 --> 01:38:03,375
Hello. Hi, Simran.

01:38:08,449 --> 01:38:10,474
But now l learnt that

01:38:11,418 --> 01:38:12,476
l was going to tell you, but. .

1657
01:38:12,519 --> 01:38:15,386
You were going to show

Crabs and here? -l was thinking
the same. l'll refuse them.

1668
01:38:42,516 --> 01:38:45,485
No. They're coming
to share our joy.

1669
01:38:46,287 --> 01:38:48,414
But. . -l'll arrange something.

1670

You bought crab in front of
a spy. Now you're trapped.

1673
01:39:22,256 --> 01:39:23,348
What happened, Mr. Chaturvedi?

1674
01:39:24,491 --> 01:39:29,485
Sir, you're here? -Because
now you can't live here.

1675
01:39:30,364 --> 01:39:31,422
You'll be thrown out.

What? What are you saying?

1679
01:39:43,344 --> 01:39:45,335
l'm speaking Hindi, not Sindhi.

1680
01:39:45,412 --> 01:39:46,470
Search him.

1681
01:39:46,513 --> 01:39:50,506
No, it's wrong to doubt
brother Aditya. -Yes.

1682
01:39:51,251 --> 01:39:52,445
By the way, mummy would've
reacted. .

1683
01:39:52,486 --> 01:39:54,351
. .if there were non-veg
in the bag.

1684

Yes, grandpa. Uncle Aditya
is very good.

1685

Yes, father-in-law. l
feel he can't do it.

1686
01:40:02,229 --> 01:40:03,457
Sister-in-law, what's
the harm in frisking?

1687
01:40:05,265 --> 01:40:07,460
lf he has no non-veg item,
we'll respect him more.

1688
01:40:08,335 --> 01:40:14,296
We won't change our thoughts
because of his words.

1689
01:40:14,475 --> 01:40:19,242
Mr. Chaturvedi, we must
trust our hero.

1690
01:40:19,413 --> 01:40:21,506
You can trust him if he
has no non-veg item.

1691
01:40:22,349 --> 01:40:25,250
Sir, search him. -Wait.

1692
01:40:25,319 --> 01:40:29,415
You can't frish Aditya.
l won't let it happen.

1693
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:31,321
Wait, Mr. Rustom.

1694
01:40:31,358 --> 01:40:34,293
lf Aditya isn't non-vegetarian
he should've. .

1695
01:40:34,328 --> 01:40:36,296
. .no problem in getting frisked.

1696
01:40:36,363 --> 01:40:38,422
Yes. -So that truth
is out in the open.

1697
01:40:39,366 --> 01:40:40,390
Watchman. -Yes, sir.

1698
01:40:40,467 --> 01:40:43,436
Search him. You'll see crab.

1699
01:40:43,437 --> 01:40:45,462
Be careful. lt might bite you.

1700
01:40:48,542 --> 01:40:52,308
Look inside. He must've hidden it.

1701
01:40:52,346 --> 01:40:53,438
There is nothing inside it. -Yeah !

1702
01:40:55,315 --> 01:40:57,442
Throw this man out of
the society now.

1703
01:40:58,318 --> 01:41:02,448
He's plotting against him as l
didn't give my flat to him.

1704
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:06,425
But he bought crab in front of
me. l saw it with my eyes.

1705
01:41:07,227 --> 01:41:08,387
Then return with your legs.

1706
01:41:12,399 --> 01:41:16,392
Now leave quickly.
Or we'll kick you.

1707
01:41:17,237 --> 01:41:18,431
What? -Turn.

1708
01:41:19,473 --> 01:41:21,304
l got it. -Ok.

1709
01:41:25,379 --> 01:41:29,440
Sir, you forgot your bag.
-No, it is not mine.

1710
01:41:29,483 --> 01:41:31,246
What are you saying? lt is yours.

1711
01:41:31,351 --> 01:41:32,443
l said it is not mine. Leave.

1712
01:41:32,486 --> 01:41:34,351
You forgot the phone too.
l've kept it inside.

1713
01:41:34,388 --> 01:41:35,480
That phone inside mine. Go away.

1714
01:41:35,522 --> 01:41:37,490
This phone isn't yours. -No.

1715
01:41:38,258 --> 01:41:39,418
Ok. Come here, brothers.

1716
01:41:39,526 --> 01:41:41,460
His phone is in the bag.

1717
01:41:41,495 --> 01:41:44,464
l'll dial his number
and check. -What?

1718
01:41:47,334 --> 01:41:49,234
lt is ringing. Didn't
l say it is inside?

1719
01:41:50,337 --> 01:41:51,429
Don't touch it. No.

1720
01:42:13,527 --> 01:42:15,461
Your crime is unforgivable.

1721
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:18,355
You can't live in this society.

1722
01:42:18,532 --> 01:42:23,367
You've to evacuate the flat. -Yes.

1723
01:42:24,404 --> 01:42:29,307
Ok, but l want to ask a question.

1724
01:42:30,444 --> 01:42:34,346
What's my crime? What have l done?

1725
01:42:34,481 --> 01:42:38,383
Did l steal, rob or kill anyone?

1726
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:44,220
Maybe this one crime is greater
than anything else.

1727
01:42:44,525 --> 01:42:46,390
We'll leave.

1728
01:42:48,328 --> 01:42:51,195
But before leaving l've
a request to you all.

1729
01:42:52,533 --> 01:42:55,502
Today our country is
divided between. .

1730
01:42:55,536 --> 01:42:58,334
. .caste, creed and languages.

1731
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:01,304
At least don't divide
the dining table.

1732
01:43:02,509 --> 01:43:04,409
l request you all.

1733
01:43:07,314 --> 01:43:09,475
lf you want to remove, remove
the evil from society.

1734
01:43:12,252 --> 01:43:15,312
Not the ones, who love you.

1735
01:43:24,464 --> 01:43:26,227
Come, Riya.

1736
01:43:35,442 --> 01:43:36,466
You?

1737
01:43:37,444 --> 01:43:39,435
l'm the owner of this
house. Adi Rustom.

1738
01:43:43,517 --> 01:43:45,382
And what are you doing here, sir?

1739
01:43:45,419 --> 01:43:48,320
l've bought this flat. -What?

1740
01:43:49,256 --> 01:43:51,486
You know l wanted this
flat for long.

1741
01:43:52,359 --> 01:43:54,452
l send my men to Rustom,
but it didn't work out.

1742
01:43:55,429 --> 01:43:57,454
Then l thought of an idea.

1743
01:43:58,365 --> 01:44:00,526
l caught his NRl son in America.

1744
01:44:01,501 --> 01:44:03,492
And he's ready to sell
his flat to me.

1745
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:05,432
You know the meaning of NRl.

1746
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:07,207
He lives there.

1747
01:44:07,441 --> 01:44:11,241
You'll be NRl too. Non-resident
of this society.

1748
01:44:11,478 --> 01:44:13,343
But this flat. . -lt's mine.

1749
01:44:14,248 --> 01:44:16,512
Yes. -So l'll decide
whom to sell it.

1750
01:44:17,317 --> 01:44:20,343
But son. -Quiet, dad.
l've promised Jhola.

1751
01:44:20,387 --> 01:44:22,218
Jhola Ramani. -Right.

1752
01:44:22,456 --> 01:44:26,324
He has to leave this
flat. -He won't.

1753
01:44:29,429 --> 01:44:30,521
You?

1754
01:44:31,398 --> 01:44:33,366
Who are you? -Chaturvedi.

1755
01:44:33,467 --> 01:44:35,367
Secretary of this society.

1756
01:44:36,370 --> 01:44:38,463
You gave power of attorney
to Mr. Rustom.

1757
01:44:38,505 --> 01:44:41,338
And Mr. Rustom made an
agreement with them.

1758
01:44:41,475 --> 01:44:43,375
You can read that agreement.

1759
01:44:44,344 --> 01:44:45,436
Take this.

1760
01:44:45,479 --> 01:44:50,416
As per this agreement, you
can't sell anything. .

1761
01:44:50,450 --> 01:44:54,284
. .until the contract
doesn't expire.

1762
01:44:54,388 --> 01:44:56,356
Very good, secretary.

1763
01:44:56,456 --> 01:44:59,425
You've vanquished others.

1764
01:45:00,294 --> 01:45:05,357
Oh ! So you're trying
to get legal here.

1765
01:45:07,401 --> 01:45:12,361
Ok. There is only 3 hours for
the contract to expire.

1766
01:45:14,408 --> 01:45:19,471
So either pay 40 lakh or evict
the flat in 3 hours.

1767
01:45:23,517 --> 01:45:28,420
lt's 9 O'clock now.

There are lots of money in it.
They won't go anywhere.

1783
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:21,432
lt's not enough, son.

1784
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:25,368
You've done a lot for us. Thanks.

1785
01:46:26,346 --> 01:46:27,506
Now we don't want
to bother anyone.

1786
01:46:28,548 --> 01:46:30,482
lt's better we leave.

1787
01:46:38,492 --> 01:46:42,360
What happened? l'm sure they've
arranged the money.

1788
01:46:42,496 --> 01:46:47,365
Their departure and my
arrival is arranged.

1789
01:46:50,504 --> 01:46:55,498
By the way, one minute is
left to 12. 60 seconds.

1799
01:47:33,513 --> 01:47:35,208
Get out from here.

1800
01:47:37,250 --> 01:47:39,377
Your work is done. Go. Lucky boy.

1801
01:47:39,453 --> 01:47:44,254
Jholar, he left with the money.
