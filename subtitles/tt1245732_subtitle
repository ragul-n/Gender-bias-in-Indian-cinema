1
00:02:53,954 --> 00:02:55,751
'It's been a week since
I met my wife and children. '

2
00:02:57,424 --> 00:03:02,054
'Away from my family, I was engaged
as a cook for a group of people. '

3
00:03:04,264 --> 00:03:08,030
'That day, for the first time
I was asked to deliver food. '

4
00:03:09,703 --> 00:03:11,500
'But, that afternoon's incidence. . . '

5
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:13,934
'changed my life completely. '

6
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:21,776
Why are you late?
- It is my first time. . .

7
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:22,778
Should've come early. . .

8
00:03:32,325 --> 00:03:33,485
No. . . no!

9
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:28,642
I am not one of them!

10
00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:30,409
I am not one of them!

11
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:33,915
I am Narsimha, not one of them.

12
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:38,252
No.

13
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:38,791
Come.

14
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,951
No!

15
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:42,022
Come with me.
- No.

16
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:55,403
Mani !

17
00:04:56,543 --> 00:04:57,532
Mani, how many of them?

18
00:04:58,244 --> 00:05:00,041
Rajnath and Vishwa were injured.

19
00:05:01,114 --> 00:05:03,378
Chika, Madhappa and Raghu got hit.

20
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:04,581
Did you make sure?
- Yes.

21
00:05:05,018 --> 00:05:06,007
And how many of them?
- Five.

22
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:13,551
Those pigs must've assumed
that we'll lie low now.

23
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,785
Make arrangements for the funeral.
Then we'll have food and move out.

24
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:21,458
And those cops, gorge their eyes out,
disfigure their faces.

25
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:23,662
It'll teach that arrogant Rathod a lesson.

26
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:26,435
Hey!

27
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:28,470
Get up. There's lot to be done.

28
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:31,209
Get some fuel from the jeep
to burn the corpses.

29
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:32,902
Get going.

30
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:53,732
Hey!

31
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:56,733
Hey! !

32
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,099
Don't grieve.

33
00:06:02,742 --> 00:06:03,640
They're revolutionaries.

34
00:06:04,878 --> 00:06:05,936
They won't go unsung.

35
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:13,850
Aren't you eating?

36
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,848
You'll need strength to work.

37
00:06:21,127 --> 00:06:21,821
Come on have food.

38
00:06:24,864 --> 00:06:26,695
Rajan, Vishwanath and
Madhu will be taken to the camp. . .

39
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:28,364
and deported to Rayanpala by jeep.

40
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:33,532
Mani, have three men carry
these cops' corpses to Puttur.

41
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:35,535
And hang them in the town square.
- Yes.

42
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:38,940
Hey!

43
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:44,240
Hey! Get up. Pick up the corpses.

44
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:49,977
You think you are some prince?

45
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,920
The cops followed you here.

46
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:54,324
If we hadn't saved you,
you would have been dead by now.

47
00:06:54,961 --> 00:06:56,087
Come on. Pick them up.

48
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:02,131
What are you staring at?
Pick up the other one.

49
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:03,901
Grab!

50
00:07:18,118 --> 00:07:19,107
Papa !

51
00:07:21,387 --> 00:07:22,183
Papa !

52
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:27,418
Catch me!

53
00:07:29,896 --> 00:07:31,454
I will sit in father's lap.

54
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:41,664
''What has life come to?''

55
00:07:42,876 --> 00:07:44,343
'Can't you stay for another day?'

56
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:52,817
''Why this mist
has engulfed me?''

57
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:57,815
''Where have the roads
of hope disappeared?''

58
00:07:58,525 --> 00:08:00,993
''Is this, what life is worth?''

59
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:04,286
''The heart yearns to know. ''

60
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:07,296
''My mind riddles me. ''

61
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:08,626
Stop staring. Start peddling.

62
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:11,295
''Will the dark night ever end?''

63
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:14,472
''Will we see the dawn again?''

64
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:17,371
'Finish sowing seeds today itself.
It may rain. '

65
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:19,672
''My mind riddles me. ''

66
00:08:19,913 --> 00:08:21,505
'Narsimha, come on, get up. '

67
00:08:21,948 --> 00:08:22,915
'Don't you have to go to school?'

68
00:08:25,518 --> 00:08:28,646
'First your father's treatment,
then your wife's pregnancy. '

69
00:08:29,355 --> 00:08:30,879
'You've already borrowed a hefty amount. '

70
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:32,088
'How will you repay that?'

71
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:34,453
'You've even lost your farm. '

72
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:37,489
'If you want more money,
then mortgage your house. '

73
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:49,805
'Don't worry. '

74
00:08:51,811 --> 00:08:53,301
'I saved it for a day like this. '

75
00:08:55,582 --> 00:08:56,571
'I'll return it. '

76
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:06,715
Hurry up, we have to reach
Puttur before nightfall.

77
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:15,934
'I don't remember how we reached
the jungle that night after hanging. . . '

78
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:17,901
'the corpses in Puttur. '

79
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:20,368
'When I woke up in the morning. . . '

80
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,303
'I realized I was still alive. '

81
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:32,951
'Instead of coffee and Jasmine,
I could smell gunshot and death. '

82
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,732
How did we fall short?
Now go to the city and. . .

83
00:09:54,908 --> 00:09:56,307
all the medicines at one go.
- Yes.

84
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:57,933
And bandages too.
Confirm the list with Radha.

85
00:10:06,953 --> 00:10:09,217
The embers of our soldiers
haven't died down. . .

86
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:10,788
yet everyone is back to work.

87
00:10:11,524 --> 00:10:12,388
And you just woke up? !

88
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:14,325
Get up!

89
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:15,760
Get to work.

90
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:19,320
I want to go home.
- Now this is your home.

91
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:21,930
No! I want to go home.
- No?

92
00:10:23,937 --> 00:10:25,802
Are you an informer?
- No!

93
00:10:26,906 --> 00:10:29,238
I am only a cook.

94
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:33,736
Three of our soldiers died because of you.

95
00:10:34,514 --> 00:10:36,038
Who'll replace them?

96
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:37,372
Get up!

97
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:40,544
I cannot kill people.

98
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:43,313
You want to be a freeloader.

99
00:10:44,123 --> 00:10:45,852
Hey, someone knock some sense into him.

100
00:10:56,836 --> 00:10:57,768
Hey! Get aside.

101
00:11:31,904 --> 00:11:33,599
If anyone withholds information. . .

102
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,366
he shall meet with the same fate.

103
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:41,780
Informers will be suitably rewarded.

104
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:48,610
Naidu. Get the bodies down.
- Yes, sir.

105
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:49,483
Hey, clear the way.

106
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:14,839
How are you feeling?

107
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:18,177
Why do you sulk like this?

108
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,410
Brother told me to stay here.

109
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:23,446
Are you scared?

110
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:25,482
Pick up the gun.

111
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:26,582
Be a man.

112
00:12:28,227 --> 00:12:30,718
I want to go home.
I want my money.

113
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,962
Money? !
- Yes.

114
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:35,697
Kariappa brought me here to cook.

115
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:37,869
He promised me Rs. 1500 a month.

116
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:41,205
It's been 3 months,
not even a penny is paid to me.

117
00:12:42,008 --> 00:12:44,909
If I don't get my money, I'm leaving.

118
00:12:45,178 --> 00:12:45,507
Go!

119
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:46,840
Go. . .

120
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,304
Chika, Madhappa and
Raghu died because of you.

121
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:50,071
You can die as well !

122
00:12:51,284 --> 00:12:52,717
The police will shoot you down like a dog.

123
00:12:57,123 --> 00:12:58,613
No! I don't want to pick up the gun.

124
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:02,622
I need the money for my children's food.

125
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,297
Maithili.
- Yes?

126
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:07,758
Give him half a sack of rice
and 2 kilos of lentils.

127
00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:10,931
I want my money.

128
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:13,261
I'll talk to Velu about your money.

129
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,900
But you'll have to fight this war.

130
00:13:17,143 --> 00:13:18,940
My children, their education. . .

131
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:19,969
Education?

132
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,949
Do you know how many people
are graduates in our Andhra itself?

133
00:13:24,484 --> 00:13:25,075
600,000.

134
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:26,985
They're working as labourers.

135
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:28,847
They're committing suicide.

136
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:31,083
Your children will meet the same end.

137
00:13:45,204 --> 00:13:45,533
Murli.

138
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:47,434
Listen.
- Yes?

139
00:13:48,741 --> 00:13:49,400
I am talking to you.

140
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:53,207
Murli, I think. . .
Hey, listen !

141
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:09,924
Sister.

142
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,655
I am going home.
- Like this.

143
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:16,431
Wait. I'll give your shirt.

144
00:14:24,877 --> 00:14:26,174
Will you go alone?
- Yes.

145
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,577
You will be lost in the jungle.

146
00:14:30,483 --> 00:14:30,949
Krishna !

147
00:14:32,685 --> 00:14:33,413
Krishna. . . ?
- Yes!

148
00:14:34,854 --> 00:14:37,322
Go along with him
and return before dawn.

149
00:14:37,857 --> 00:14:38,255
Yes.

150
00:14:39,325 --> 00:14:39,814
Come, Narsimha.

151
00:14:59,111 --> 00:14:59,770
Stop here.

152
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:01,709
This is the place.

153
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:06,175
You go. I will wait here.
- Okay.

154
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,014
I will be back.
- Hurry up.

155
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:33,473
Are the children asleep?
- Yes.

156
00:15:44,123 --> 00:15:45,420
They slept early!
- Yes.

157
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:52,654
Water.

158
00:15:56,602 --> 00:15:57,762
What happened there?

159
00:15:58,337 --> 00:16:00,100
Nothing.
It will get okay.

160
00:16:04,143 --> 00:16:05,132
You came after ten days.

161
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:07,779
Can't help it.
The job's like that.

162
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:09,712
Next time it may take. . .

163
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,107
a month or maybe two.

164
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:18,151
You have no idea. . .

165
00:16:19,558 --> 00:16:20,855
people spread rumors.

166
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:22,725
Forget what they say.

167
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,258
Look, whatever I'm doing. . .

168
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:29,225
it's for the family that I do.

169
00:16:32,972 --> 00:16:35,805
I need money to pay the children's fees.

170
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:38,533
Their shoes are torn too.

171
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:42,775
Don't worry.
The money will be arranged.

172
00:16:43,816 --> 00:16:44,748
I'll get it.

173
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:51,117
Move! Come on, crawl.

174
00:16:51,924 --> 00:16:52,891
Come on, crawl.

175
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:54,017
Crawl, crawl.

176
00:16:54,293 --> 00:16:54,816
Up, up.

177
00:16:57,563 --> 00:16:58,689
Brother, do it right.

178
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:02,125
Run properly with the rifle.

179
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:02,696
Wake up!

180
00:17:05,604 --> 00:17:06,093
Get up!

181
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:10,567
Who do you think you are?

182
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:13,711
Come on get up.
And start training.

183
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:16,739
Keeps sleeping like an animal.

184
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,210
Come on, everyone Hurry up.

185
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:22,084
Mother fuckers, won't even realise,
we will attack all of a sudden.

186
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:23,251
Soma, get the jeep.

187
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:24,389
Didn't you hear?

188
00:17:25,624 --> 00:17:26,352
Come on, get up.

189
00:17:28,394 --> 00:17:29,691
Where to?
- Where to? !

190
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:32,320
Don't ask questions.
They're brother Velu's orders.

191
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:33,830
Tony, you go ahead.
I will bring him along.

192
00:17:35,368 --> 00:17:38,963
Narsimha, get use to all this.
You are a part of it now.

193
00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:40,104
Come.

194
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:51,207
Come on !

195
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:20,502
Come on.

196
00:18:21,814 --> 00:18:22,974
Hey! Take all the ammunition.

197
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:33,616
Come on, hurry up!

198
00:18:58,217 --> 00:18:58,740
Sister Saral !

199
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:01,043
Come here.
- What. . . ?

200
00:19:37,857 --> 00:19:38,755
Got 15 of them, brother.
- Fine.

201
00:19:58,277 --> 00:19:59,505
Red salute!
- Red salute!

202
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,981
The government feels embarrassed.

203
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:09,518
And Rathod. . .
he is seething with rage.

204
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,283
All the news channels are
covering this news round the clock.

205
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:16,117
You've hit them real hard.

206
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:18,253
They must realise. . .

207
00:20:18,764 --> 00:20:20,129
we aren't going to
take things lying down.

208
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:21,130
Murli !
- Yes, brother.

209
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:24,099
The Chief Minister is disturbed too.

210
00:20:25,304 --> 00:20:26,896
Even the opposition has ruined
his peace of mind.

211
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:30,909
I have also heard that. . .

212
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:33,573
1 9 cops and some villagers
were killed in Agadhi.

213
00:20:36,048 --> 00:20:36,912
The villagers also say that. . .

214
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,644
there was a large stock of arms
in the police station. . .

215
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:40,745
that's why you people attacked there.

216
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:44,553
The police suspect that. . .

217
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:46,950
someone's leaking information to you.

218
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:55,899
''Just like a wheel doesn't move
without grease. . . ''

219
00:20:56,201 --> 00:21:02,800
''A revolution doesn't move
without sacrifice. ''

220
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:13,919
My only wish is. . .

221
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:16,218
to hang Rathod upside down.

222
00:21:16,989 --> 00:21:17,614
Brother. . .

223
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:18,847
Food. . .

224
00:21:21,226 --> 00:21:21,817
Later, Narsimha.

225
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:23,458
He's very lucky.

226
00:21:24,363 --> 00:21:25,227
He escaped thrice.

227
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:42,671
Food. . . ?

228
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,183
Sister. . .

229
00:21:56,662 --> 00:21:59,790
she's been like that since morning.
- Bastards. . . those cops.

230
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,474
You'll gain nothing by being frail.

231
00:22:19,885 --> 00:22:20,510
Don't be afraid.

232
00:22:23,989 --> 00:22:27,254
When you hold a gun,
it lessens your fear.

233
00:22:29,061 --> 00:22:30,153
Actuallly, it makes you fearless.

234
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,383
Those wretched cops. . .

235
00:23:02,327 --> 00:23:03,385
I pity them.

236
00:23:05,397 --> 00:23:08,093
They're our enemies just because
they work for the government.

237
00:23:09,868 --> 00:23:13,895
If they had died for us, they would
at least have had a decent funeral.

238
00:23:15,274 --> 00:23:15,968
Brother, food.

239
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:21,170
That'll do.

240
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:22,638
Enough.

241
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:26,217
Hey!

242
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:29,219
Come here.

243
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:33,820
Yes, brother?

244
00:23:35,227 --> 00:23:38,560
Did the cooked chicken spring back to life?
Did it fly away?

245
00:23:39,465 --> 00:23:43,765
Others ate too.
- You brought me leftovers?

246
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:46,865
No. I did ask you earlier.

247
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:48,806
What. . . ?

248
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:50,805
Are you doing me a favour?

249
00:23:51,143 --> 00:23:54,135
Brother Velu, why get angry. . .
- I don't want any food.

250
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:58,041
Brother Velu. . .

251
00:24:49,101 --> 00:24:50,796
I don't know what you been through.

252
00:24:52,337 --> 00:24:55,101
But. . . you shouldn't sit isolated.

253
00:24:57,576 --> 00:24:58,565
Everyone's sitting there.

254
00:25:00,612 --> 00:25:01,738
Shall we join them?

255
00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:04,582
Lakshmi. . .

256
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,884
Yeah, I know it all. . .

257
00:25:12,224 --> 00:25:16,422
Sister, Lakshmi. . .
- Lakshmi, you are still awake.

258
00:25:17,863 --> 00:25:20,559
Fine, you can sleep besides these two.
- Sit.

259
00:25:20,732 --> 00:25:23,701
Come sit. You can be with me.
- Watch out.

260
00:25:24,102 --> 00:25:25,069
She snores a lot.

261
00:25:26,138 --> 00:25:27,799
Sister, she does this all the time. . .
- Stop it!

262
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:30,172
Always fighting like children.

263
00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:31,407
Do I snore?
- Enough !

264
00:25:32,611 --> 00:25:35,478
Sister. . .
- You go, sleep.

265
00:25:39,218 --> 00:25:39,775
Sister. . .

266
00:25:40,586 --> 00:25:42,451
Did sister Radha speak to brother Velu?

267
00:25:42,654 --> 00:25:44,451
About what?
- My money?

268
00:25:46,091 --> 00:25:46,921
We'll talk tomorrow morning.

269
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,885
Sister. . .
- I said, we will talk in the morning.

270
00:25:51,096 --> 00:25:51,721
Now go, sleep.

271
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:04,472
I picked up the gun at the age of 15.

272
00:26:07,012 --> 00:26:08,309
Since then I feared no one.

273
00:26:20,492 --> 00:26:21,186
Are you a communist?

274
00:26:21,994 --> 00:26:24,258
No a journalist. Telangana Samachara.

275
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:26,857
How many members are there
in your group?

276
00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:29,123
No idea.

277
00:26:30,535 --> 00:26:32,662
Your leader?
- Brother Velu.

278
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:36,405
The one that attacked
the police station at Agadhi?

279
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,172
Is it him?

280
00:26:39,511 --> 00:26:41,536
I don't know about all that.
Keep moving.

281
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,479
Come on crawl.

282
00:26:43,882 --> 00:26:44,541
Come on, move.

283
00:26:45,217 --> 00:26:46,616
You're being lazy.

284
00:26:47,286 --> 00:26:49,049
Come on, move forward.

285
00:26:49,721 --> 00:26:52,485
Come on, further ahead.

286
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:54,289
Faster, faster.

287
00:26:54,626 --> 00:26:57,720
How much further?
- Just a little more.

288
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,524
I've been hearing that for an hour now.

289
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:03,200
Shall I take the blindfold off?
- Hey! That'd mean trouble.

290
00:27:04,636 --> 00:27:05,830
Come on. . .

291
00:27:06,071 --> 00:27:07,060
Move forward.

292
00:27:12,077 --> 00:27:13,908
Move forward. Crawl ahead.

293
00:27:14,513 --> 00:27:15,605
Lower your head.

294
00:27:18,817 --> 00:27:19,181
Take it off.

295
00:27:25,557 --> 00:27:27,024
I'm Raghavan.
- He's brother Velu.

296
00:27:29,494 --> 00:27:29,926
Come.

297
00:27:36,902 --> 00:27:37,368
Hurry up!

298
00:27:38,136 --> 00:27:38,534
Hurry!

299
00:27:39,271 --> 00:27:40,067
Come on, quick.

300
00:27:41,673 --> 00:27:43,937
Not like this, hold it this way.
Aim there.

301
00:27:44,343 --> 00:27:45,173
There. . .

302
00:27:46,478 --> 00:27:47,638
Straighten, upright.

303
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:48,812
Yes.

304
00:27:49,614 --> 00:27:49,978
That. . .

305
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:51,037
Come on, once again.

306
00:27:52,017 --> 00:27:52,608
Come on, go.

307
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:54,885
Move!

308
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,212
Amazing !
- We have to do it.

309
00:27:59,224 --> 00:28:00,282
It's a for the people's rights.

310
00:28:01,593 --> 00:28:02,389
This is the people's army.

311
00:28:02,961 --> 00:28:06,829
I had heard about it. But had
never imagined it to be so professional.

312
00:28:07,866 --> 00:28:09,925
Raghavan, the government has
a lot of money. . .

313
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:11,602
weapons and men.

314
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:14,470
But we only have the passion.

315
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,305
If you don't mind, Velu, sir. . .

316
00:28:17,676 --> 00:28:22,170
The government says that you're
against development.

317
00:28:23,148 --> 00:28:24,638
You are anti-development.

318
00:28:26,651 --> 00:28:28,278
We took 2000 acres of land. . .

319
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:31,212
from the feudal lords.
and distrbuted it amongst the poor.

320
00:28:32,224 --> 00:28:34,852
We installed bore-wells there.
We established five villages. . .

321
00:28:34,993 --> 00:28:36,483
that have schools, hospitals, everything.

322
00:28:37,662 --> 00:28:39,459
That's the kind of
anti-development work we're into.

323
00:28:40,866 --> 00:28:41,332
Publish that.

324
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:45,163
Velu, sir. . . can I. . .
- Yes, sure.

325
00:28:47,472 --> 00:28:48,302
Even women take training?

326
00:28:48,907 --> 00:28:52,308
It's their combat too.
We don't consider women any less.

327
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:01,949
Hold it tight.

328
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:06,053
Not lowered, upright, straight,
look in front.

329
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,588
Never take your eyes off the target.

330
00:29:12,397 --> 00:29:12,886
A little upwards.

331
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:18,326
Come Lakshmi.

332
00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:21,435
You've to be one of them too.

333
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:25,032
What is it?

334
00:29:26,478 --> 00:29:27,103
Why are you so stunned?

335
00:29:29,047 --> 00:29:29,706
Don't be afraid.

336
00:29:32,651 --> 00:29:33,413
Here, keep this.

337
00:29:37,355 --> 00:29:39,448
If anybody crosses the limits. . .
kill him.

338
00:29:41,526 --> 00:29:42,015
Take it.

339
00:29:52,971 --> 00:29:54,939
Is she ready for this?

340
00:29:56,274 --> 00:29:56,603
Yes.

341
00:29:57,676 --> 00:29:59,576
No knowing when she might need it.

342
00:30:00,412 --> 00:30:02,346
You make it sound so simple.

343
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:05,277
Simple it is.

344
00:30:06,418 --> 00:30:07,885
Pull the trigger and the story ends.

345
00:30:14,626 --> 00:30:15,024
Raghavan.

346
00:30:17,629 --> 00:30:20,325
This looks like
the Cambodia-Vietnam of 1 9 7 0s.

347
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:23,099
For such a big operation. . .

348
00:30:23,201 --> 00:30:25,101
one needs lot of funds.
Where do you get it from?

349
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:26,359
From the liberated zones here.

350
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:31,000
For the first time they are getting
proper wages and complete facilities.

351
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,309
In return, we collect
some taxes from them.

352
00:30:33,979 --> 00:30:35,606
But we aren't leech on them
like the government.

353
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:37,579
A parallel government.

354
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:40,075
That's why the government
wants to eliminate you.

355
00:30:40,752 --> 00:30:42,083
That's because we expose them.

356
00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:45,946
So, instead of the foreign terrorism
they want to eliminate our revolution.

357
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:49,322
There's a wide difference between
terrorism and revolution.

358
00:30:50,362 --> 00:30:52,523
They're against the nation.
We are against the system.

359
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:57,928
You are lucky to have spent
so much time with us.

360
00:31:00,772 --> 00:31:02,569
Yes, thanks to comrade Krishnaraj.

361
00:31:06,144 --> 00:31:07,771
So. . . now publish. . .

362
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,769
only the truth about us, okay.

363
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,182
Brother.

364
00:31:13,652 --> 00:31:14,016
Later.

365
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,245
And comrade Krishnaraj. . .
- I need to talk to you right now.

366
00:31:17,856 --> 00:31:18,845
I said, later.

367
00:31:22,127 --> 00:31:25,324
Comrade Krishna. . .
- I was promised Rs 1500 a month.

368
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,097
I haven't been paid a penny.

369
00:31:30,302 --> 00:31:32,202
I only ask for my earned money.

370
00:31:33,138 --> 00:31:33,968
It's been three months, brother.

371
00:31:35,507 --> 00:31:37,236
I have a wife and children.

372
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,271
And I don't. . .

373
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:47,107
They're all dead.

374
00:31:49,454 --> 00:31:50,250
Do you know why?

375
00:31:53,124 --> 00:31:54,648
Because of the fight
for the rights of people like you.

376
00:31:55,594 --> 00:31:56,322
To protect. . .

377
00:31:56,861 --> 00:31:59,056
people like you, I gave up my right
to have children.

378
00:32:00,131 --> 00:32:02,156
I don't even remember
when I last slept with a woman.

379
00:32:04,736 --> 00:32:07,398
Haven't even removed the bullet
lodged in my back. For whose sake?

380
00:32:08,773 --> 00:32:09,671
For whom?

381
00:32:14,212 --> 00:32:15,611
But I need the money. . .

382
00:32:18,216 --> 00:32:18,978
for my children.

383
00:33:30,989 --> 00:33:31,455
Hey, brother!

384
00:33:32,223 --> 00:33:34,623
Narsimha, you are holding it wrong.
Rest it on your shoulder.

385
00:33:35,093 --> 00:33:36,560
So that it doesn't recoil.

386
00:33:36,961 --> 00:33:37,620
And then. . .

387
00:33:37,829 --> 00:33:41,595
Not there. . . that's the magazine.
It contains bullets. Hold here.

388
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:44,962
Like this. Push in a little.
Let the shoulder be at ease.

389
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,699
Now aim at the bottle.
Keep your left eye closed.

390
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,307
Can you see it?
- Yes. . .

391
00:33:49,507 --> 00:33:50,496
yes. . .
- Shoot!

392
00:33:56,981 --> 00:33:57,811
Brother Soma !

393
00:34:00,385 --> 00:34:01,409
Your have a very good aim.

394
00:34:02,554 --> 00:34:03,248
Teach me too.

395
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,254
I am serious.

396
00:34:07,058 --> 00:34:07,820
You want to. . .

397
00:34:08,026 --> 00:34:09,015
fire a gun wearing a sari?

398
00:34:10,228 --> 00:34:11,024
Take the uniform from sister Radha. . .

399
00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:12,058
and meet me after an hour.

400
00:34:12,597 --> 00:34:12,995
Alright?

401
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:29,569
Narsimha.

402
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:32,844
Lakshmi !

403
00:34:35,387 --> 00:34:37,582
You look. . . so difffernt.

404
00:34:44,529 --> 00:34:45,689
Now, this is my life.

405
00:34:46,664 --> 00:34:49,326
I'll live and die here.

406
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,734
Why did the police arrest you?

407
00:34:57,542 --> 00:34:59,203
I used to work for contractor.

408
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:03,370
The mother fucker wanted to
sleep with me.

409
00:35:04,516 --> 00:35:05,107
I refused.

410
00:35:06,651 --> 00:35:08,380
So he accused me of theft
and handed me over to the police.

411
00:35:11,222 --> 00:35:12,814
All the cops. . .

412
00:35:14,692 --> 00:35:15,317
whole night.

413
00:35:17,862 --> 00:35:18,794
one after the other. . .

414
00:35:21,566 --> 00:35:23,898
Then they. . . dumped me.

415
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:25,902
Now. . .

416
00:35:27,772 --> 00:35:30,536
if such are the cops,
then we. . .

417
00:35:30,975 --> 00:35:31,669
Bloody brutes!

418
00:35:37,482 --> 00:35:40,076
Narsimha, are you married?
- Yes.

419
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:42,377
I have a lovely wife.

420
00:35:43,655 --> 00:35:44,485
I have two kids. . .

421
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,015
They are brats.

422
00:35:47,225 --> 00:35:49,887
But they are studious.

423
00:35:54,132 --> 00:35:54,962
Brother.
- Yes.

424
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,263
We have informed
the 'Tendu' leaf contractors.

425
00:35:58,002 --> 00:35:59,765
We've called them
to Sumanpally's warehouse.

426
00:36:01,306 --> 00:36:01,704
Fine.

427
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,431
You all go in different buses.
I'll come by jeep.

428
00:36:05,243 --> 00:36:05,868
Brother.
- Yes.

429
00:36:06,044 --> 00:36:06,703
It could be dangerous.

430
00:36:08,646 --> 00:36:09,374
Make sure you are armed.

431
00:36:11,115 --> 00:36:12,946
I won't let the scoundrels
sell a single 'Tendu' leaf.

432
00:36:14,085 --> 00:36:15,950
The mother fuckers think only
they can manufacture biddies.

433
00:36:23,528 --> 00:36:26,395
So?
- Brother, this won't work out.

434
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:29,324
Do we look like fools to you?

435
00:36:31,135 --> 00:36:33,467
How long will you exploit
these poor workers?

436
00:36:33,972 --> 00:36:35,769
Brother, we can't afford to give
more than Rs. 2.

437
00:36:36,074 --> 00:36:37,405
I'll give you Rs. 3.

438
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,608
Let's see how you
support your family?

439
00:36:40,178 --> 00:36:41,577
Brother, you are asking for almost double.

440
00:36:42,947 --> 00:36:45,643
Fine, then I'll have to deport you to hell.
Who'll go first?

441
00:36:45,884 --> 00:36:46,282
No, brother.

442
00:36:47,485 --> 00:36:48,474
You can't do this.

443
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,053
I. . . can do so.

444
00:36:51,456 --> 00:36:54,914
I can kill you and hang you upside down
in front of Rathod's house.

445
00:36:55,293 --> 00:36:58,228
But brother, we also have to
pay the officers.

446
00:36:59,931 --> 00:37:02,263
Serves you right
for licking their boots.

447
00:37:03,468 --> 00:37:07,063
Had you stood by us,
you'd have never faced such a day.

448
00:37:07,505 --> 00:37:09,336
Brother, let's settle the issue here.

449
00:37:11,843 --> 00:37:12,309
Rs. 5.

450
00:37:13,611 --> 00:37:16,045
It's too much !
- And 20% tax.

451
00:37:16,648 --> 00:37:18,775
Brother, we'll be ruined.
- Murli, take them away.

452
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:19,815
Brother!
- Hey!

453
00:37:22,554 --> 00:37:26,149
Rs. 5 to men as well women
for your labour.

454
00:37:50,648 --> 00:37:52,548
I envy you.

455
00:37:53,785 --> 00:37:56,276
From all of you
who can read and write.

456
00:37:57,689 --> 00:37:59,384
Books mean everything to me.

457
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,350
These words are mightier than weapons.

458
00:38:04,596 --> 00:38:08,191
When you, brother Velu and
Radha speak. . .

459
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,531
it encourages me.

460
00:38:11,669 --> 00:38:12,636
Teach me as well.

461
00:38:14,572 --> 00:38:16,062
I do know a bit of reading and writing.

462
00:38:19,877 --> 00:38:20,366
Take this.

463
00:38:21,946 --> 00:38:23,208
Read this aloud everyday.

464
00:38:24,215 --> 00:38:25,375
When you're done with this.
I'll teach you to write.

465
00:38:29,053 --> 00:38:34,582
'The government plans. . . '

466
00:38:35,627 --> 00:38:37,993
'to take action. . . '

467
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:42,093
'against. . . '

468
00:38:44,068 --> 00:38:48,095
'the public. . . '

469
00:38:48,573 --> 00:38:50,404
'uprising. '

470
00:38:51,909 --> 00:38:52,807
Brother Murli.

471
00:38:53,778 --> 00:38:56,144
Why doesn't the government
understand our plight?

472
00:38:56,848 --> 00:39:00,409
We vote to form a government.
But what's the use?

473
00:39:01,986 --> 00:39:03,715
Everything remains the same.

474
00:39:04,522 --> 00:39:06,717
There's no dearth of food,
water and cloths in this country.

475
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,258
But these politicians and
government officers. . .

476
00:39:12,964 --> 00:39:15,091
only want power and money.

477
00:39:16,634 --> 00:39:17,532
They are raping this country.

478
00:39:20,705 --> 00:39:21,467
Now we'll change things.

479
00:39:23,241 --> 00:39:24,572
But this war isn't that easy.

480
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,323
I just met comrade Krishnaraj.

481
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:43,490
GMWG meeting has been scheduled
four weeks later.

482
00:39:45,697 --> 00:39:48,165
Krishnaraj wants you to
meet him at Tippogondanpalya.

483
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:50,525
They're going to take a major decision.

484
00:39:54,305 --> 00:39:54,896
Anything else?

485
00:39:55,306 --> 00:39:56,796
You have to attack at
landlord Govind Reddy's place.

486
00:39:58,476 --> 00:39:59,534
Inform comrade Krishnaraj. . .

487
00:40:01,846 --> 00:40:02,972
Govind Reddy will be dead, tomorrow.

488
00:40:34,445 --> 00:40:35,571
Surround them.

489
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:47,853
There's no one here.

490
00:41:29,267 --> 00:41:30,393
Hurry! Hurry!

491
00:42:07,205 --> 00:42:07,864
Come on, get up.

492
00:42:08,406 --> 00:42:09,270
You'll be fine.

493
00:42:20,718 --> 00:42:21,207
Who was it?

494
00:42:24,088 --> 00:42:26,522
Who was the informer?

495
00:42:38,336 --> 00:42:39,928
Lakshmi, come here.

496
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:03,282
Whoever informed the police last night. . .

497
00:43:05,596 --> 00:43:07,257
and put all your lives in danger. . .

498
00:43:08,532 --> 00:43:09,556
might even inform the police
of this location.

499
00:43:11,502 --> 00:43:12,469
I want to know, who did it?

500
00:43:20,978 --> 00:43:21,569
What are you waiting for?

501
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,676
Don't you want justice?

502
00:43:25,449 --> 00:43:26,143
Go, find out.

503
00:43:28,386 --> 00:43:29,410
No one will doubt you.

504
00:43:41,299 --> 00:43:42,095
I'm going to the market.

505
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:43,764
Does anybody need anything?

506
00:43:44,068 --> 00:43:45,000
Lakshmi, do one thing. . .

507
00:43:46,537 --> 00:43:49,005
get a notebook and
few pencils for Narsimha.

508
00:43:50,174 --> 00:43:50,640
Anybody else?

509
00:43:51,042 --> 00:43:51,974
Anybody else wants anything?

510
00:43:52,376 --> 00:43:53,138
I'll come along.

511
00:44:01,986 --> 00:44:02,350
One. . .

512
00:44:04,789 --> 00:44:05,278
two. . .

513
00:44:07,658 --> 00:44:08,181
three. . .

514
00:44:09,894 --> 00:44:12,419
You don't care about me these days?
- Do I have the time?

515
00:44:14,031 --> 00:44:14,861
Who'll put up the posters?

516
00:44:17,335 --> 00:44:18,893
You have time for Lakshmi and Narsimha. . .

517
00:44:20,137 --> 00:44:21,126
but not for me.

518
00:44:22,573 --> 00:44:23,369
What do I do?

519
00:44:26,377 --> 00:44:28,811
Sleep with these posters. It'll be fun.

520
00:44:57,742 --> 00:44:58,572
How did you join the outfit?

521
00:45:01,045 --> 00:45:02,376
I was sitting jobless for a year.

522
00:45:03,614 --> 00:45:04,638
Even my farm had dried up. . .

523
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:06,544
so I joined them.

524
00:45:08,686 --> 00:45:09,345
Who brought you here?

525
00:45:13,591 --> 00:45:14,285
He didn't belong to the outfit.

526
00:45:16,327 --> 00:45:18,420
And. . . your family?

527
00:45:21,232 --> 00:45:23,257
There's no one. I'm alone.

528
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:32,140
You didn't marry?
Or is there any girlfriend?

529
00:45:34,612 --> 00:45:35,840
There isn't enough to eat. . .

530
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:37,839
and you talk of a girlfriend.

531
00:46:18,055 --> 00:46:20,580
Brother Murli. . .
Here are the books for Narsimha.

532
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:21,819
Give it to him.

533
00:47:32,062 --> 00:47:34,963
You know, I come home to you
whenever I get the chance.

534
00:47:35,166 --> 00:47:36,224
That's a lie.

535
00:48:01,592 --> 00:48:03,150
I have some of your belongings.

536
00:48:04,028 --> 00:48:04,892
Come and collect yours.

537
00:48:05,896 --> 00:48:06,362
Come.

538
00:48:41,865 --> 00:48:42,422
Narsimha !

539
00:48:52,309 --> 00:48:52,866
Yes, brother.

540
00:48:54,345 --> 00:48:55,642
Krishna wouldn't have managed
to go too far.

541
00:48:56,647 --> 00:48:57,636
He trusts you a lot.

542
00:48:58,983 --> 00:48:59,608
Find him.

543
00:49:00,284 --> 00:49:00,716
Yes, brother.

544
00:49:06,557 --> 00:49:07,683
Brother. . . I. . .

545
00:49:10,594 --> 00:49:12,061
Mani ! Pindappa !

546
00:49:13,998 --> 00:49:14,692
Keep an eye on him.

547
00:49:15,799 --> 00:49:16,823
It's okay if kill's Krishna. . .

548
00:49:18,702 --> 00:49:19,600
else kill both of them.

549
00:49:20,638 --> 00:49:21,070
Yes.

550
00:49:35,352 --> 00:49:36,785
Come, Narsimha.

551
00:49:46,897 --> 00:49:47,329
Brother Krishna !

552
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:50,429
Brother Krishna. . . !

553
00:49:53,304 --> 00:49:53,963
Brother Krishna?

554
00:49:56,974 --> 00:49:57,872
Brother Krishna !

555
00:50:04,648 --> 00:50:05,273
Brother!

556
00:50:10,654 --> 00:50:11,313
Brother, Krishna !

557
00:50:20,164 --> 00:50:20,789
Brother Krishna. . . ?

558
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,334
Narsimha !
- Brother.

559
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:27,327
Are you alone?

560
00:50:27,905 --> 00:50:28,394
Yes, brother.

561
00:50:30,974 --> 00:50:31,702
Where are you?

562
00:50:35,879 --> 00:50:36,402
Brother. . . ?

563
00:50:41,752 --> 00:50:42,343
Narsimha.

564
00:50:44,655 --> 00:50:46,520
Did anyone follow you?
- No.

565
00:50:46,824 --> 00:50:50,885
Narsimha, it's not like you think.
I was helpless.

566
00:50:51,295 --> 00:50:52,956
I was caught between
the Police and the Naxals.

567
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:54,558
If I hadn't done all this, Narsimha. . .

568
00:50:54,965 --> 00:50:55,693
then they would have. . .

569
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:58,494
It's good you came, Narsimha.

570
00:51:03,774 --> 00:51:04,604
Narsi. . .

571
00:51:07,878 --> 00:51:09,243
'Pull the trigger and the story ends. '

572
00:52:50,726 --> 00:52:52,489
We face a serious situation this time.

573
00:52:53,129 --> 00:52:54,289
You must be aware. . .

574
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,364
that the iron mining contract. . .

575
00:53:02,605 --> 00:53:04,630
has been given to
Mac Iron and Steel Company.

576
00:53:06,342 --> 00:53:08,242
So, all the iron ore here. .
will go to. . .

577
00:53:10,379 --> 00:53:11,437
the neighbouring district.

578
00:53:13,349 --> 00:53:16,477
A Special Economic Zone ( SEZ ) is
being built there.

579
00:53:17,353 --> 00:53:19,947
Because, that slimy Manoharan
hails from that region.

580
00:53:21,957 --> 00:53:24,357
The people there will make a fortune.
While here. . .

581
00:53:26,128 --> 00:53:28,289
our entire jungle. . .

582
00:53:29,098 --> 00:53:29,757
will be ruined.

583
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,460
The people here will be famished.

584
00:53:35,404 --> 00:53:36,735
There will be no
employment opportunities left.

585
00:53:38,073 --> 00:53:39,938
I tried my best
to have the steel plant built here.

586
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:43,635
My friends and NGOs strived a lot. . .

587
00:53:44,647 --> 00:53:46,376
but to no avail.

588
00:53:48,617 --> 00:53:49,379
Next week. . .

589
00:53:51,253 --> 00:53:52,880
delegates from the Mac Iron Company. . .

590
00:53:53,022 --> 00:53:54,546
and government officers are coming here.

591
00:53:57,026 --> 00:53:58,118
Make sure they don't return.

592
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:07,199
Off the record, the Govind Reddy
Incident. . .

593
00:54:08,137 --> 00:54:10,765
was a major failure of
our intelligence network.

594
00:54:12,842 --> 00:54:13,365
Actually. . .

595
00:54:15,144 --> 00:54:16,873
we had become overconfident.

596
00:54:17,213 --> 00:54:19,010
Krishnaraj has no qualms. . .

597
00:54:20,049 --> 00:54:21,539
about killing people.

598
00:54:22,818 --> 00:54:24,012
But those victims too have homes. . .

599
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,512
and families.

600
00:54:28,691 --> 00:54:30,124
Are you a new recruit in Vellu's outfit?

601
00:54:33,496 --> 00:54:33,985
Yes, sir.

602
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:36,229
You talk like a rebel.

603
00:54:36,765 --> 00:54:37,322
No, sir.

604
00:54:38,501 --> 00:54:40,992
It's our people on both the sides, sir.

605
00:54:41,937 --> 00:54:43,802
Then why this bloodshed?

606
00:54:44,306 --> 00:54:46,297
Because the government
is the terrorist here.

607
00:54:47,843 --> 00:54:48,901
They resort to violence.

608
00:54:50,045 --> 00:54:51,103
We just retort.

609
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:54,174
Counter-violence. . .

610
00:54:55,384 --> 00:54:56,578
against the capitalists.

611
00:54:57,219 --> 00:54:57,708
Yes, sir.

612
00:54:58,621 --> 00:54:59,087
Sir. . .

613
00:55:00,055 --> 00:55:02,216
will we get a good life?

614
00:55:02,625 --> 00:55:03,649
How long will it take, sir?

615
00:55:06,395 --> 00:55:08,090
You seem to be in a hurry.

616
00:55:08,264 --> 00:55:10,198
I'm just asking, sir.

617
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,994
It's easy to ask questions.
This is a war. We could even lose.

618
00:55:17,206 --> 00:55:18,935
Winning is not important.

619
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,641
It's our participation that counts.

620
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:24,939
Yes, sir.

621
00:55:57,446 --> 00:55:58,572
Oh, my God !

622
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:18,188
Come on ! Quick!

623
00:56:20,736 --> 00:56:22,397
Move ahead.
No one should escape.

624
00:56:28,243 --> 00:56:29,574
Look ahead. There!

625
00:56:34,617 --> 00:56:35,845
Get them away from here.

626
00:56:36,485 --> 00:56:37,850
Move him from here.

627
00:56:40,122 --> 00:56:41,521
Take him. Move him.

628
00:56:50,299 --> 00:56:52,130
Turn the camera this side.

629
00:56:54,303 --> 00:56:55,327
Hold them.

630
00:56:57,873 --> 00:56:59,431
Is the camera on. . . is it?

631
00:56:59,608 --> 00:57:01,337
Every 24 hours, one of your. . .

632
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,135
team members will be killed.

633
00:57:03,445 --> 00:57:06,778
If our demands to stop
the steel plant isn't met with. . .

634
00:57:07,416 --> 00:57:11,079
then all of them will be killed
within the next seven days.

635
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,011
We warn you.
Red salute!

636
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:26,227
What do we do?
There are too many restrictions.

637
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:28,233
Three of them are foreigners.
This is an emergency.

638
00:57:28,837 --> 00:57:30,930
The Grey Hound Squad
hasn't been sanctioned yet.

639
00:57:31,507 --> 00:57:32,804
Fighting without a commando unit is. . .

640
00:57:32,975 --> 00:57:34,203
Sudhendhu.
- Yes.

641
00:57:34,777 --> 00:57:36,608
Give them whatever they want.
- Yes, sir.

642
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,871
The hostages should be saved
within 24 hours.

643
00:57:40,683 --> 00:57:43,584
Raid all the Naxal villages.
Shoot at sight, if need be.

644
00:58:44,513 --> 00:58:46,606
That scoundrel burnt
so many Naxal villages.

645
00:58:47,249 --> 00:58:48,580
The villagers will lose faith in us.

646
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:51,248
No, they won't.
We are fighting for them.

647
00:58:53,422 --> 00:58:54,081
You leave.

648
00:59:02,931 --> 00:59:05,161
In our special edition
the Mac Iron kidnapping case.

649
00:59:05,534 --> 00:59:08,298
In which the government had to surrender
to the demands of the Naxals.

650
00:59:08,804 --> 00:59:12,103
The government's failure was discussed
at large in the assembly today.

651
00:59:12,941 --> 00:59:14,772
The opposition created an uproar.

652
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:17,542
Condemning the killing of
three hostages.

653
00:59:17,946 --> 00:59:19,311
One of whom was a Japanese citizen.

654
00:59:19,982 --> 00:59:21,711
The killing of innocent villagers
and the atrocities. . .

655
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:25,214
committed on them by the police
was also raised by the opposition.

656
00:59:25,621 --> 00:59:28,317
The government was accused
of being a total failure. . .

657
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:30,253
regarding the Naxalite issue.
Hence it should. . .

658
00:59:30,425 --> 00:59:33,861
review their strategy
to handle the Naxalites.

659
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:36,561
The Chief Minister has apologised
to the villagers. . .

660
00:59:37,065 --> 00:59:39,260
and promised compensation
for the victim's families.

661
00:59:39,635 --> 00:59:43,264
For now, the steel plant project
in Rayalpettah has been put on hold.

662
00:59:43,672 --> 00:59:44,866
To discuss this issue. . .

663
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,105
we have with us in our studio,
Mr. Manoharan Naidu.

664
00:59:47,543 --> 00:59:49,101
Who has been a proponent
of developing the steel plant. . .

665
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:51,679
And a SEZ in Rayalpettah.

666
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:54,005
Manoharan, sir, you were saying that. . .

667
00:59:55,818 --> 00:59:56,409
Yes, fine.

668
00:59:59,121 --> 01:00:00,383
The human rights group are on their way.

669
01:00:01,089 --> 01:00:02,886
There are foreign correspondents
waiting outside.

670
01:00:04,793 --> 01:00:05,452
What's to be done?

671
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:09,928
What do I tell them?

672
01:00:59,882 --> 01:01:00,780
Naidu.
- Yes.

673
01:01:01,183 --> 01:01:02,810
Sew the heads to the severed bodies.

674
01:01:04,586 --> 01:01:06,918
Don't waste time trying to match
the heads with the bodies.

675
01:01:16,265 --> 01:01:17,254
Ma'am
- Yes.

676
01:01:17,666 --> 01:01:19,691
Ma'am onions, chillies.
- Right away!

677
01:01:20,068 --> 01:01:21,933
Curry leaves and potatoes.
- Okay.

678
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:26,441
'Police released sketches of
Naxal suspects'

679
01:01:30,512 --> 01:01:31,444
Ma'ma
- Yes?

680
01:01:31,747 --> 01:01:32,475
May I have that paper?

681
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:36,246
How many potatoes?

682
01:01:46,061 --> 01:01:46,720
Narsimha !

683
01:01:55,904 --> 01:01:56,871
What are you reading so intently?

684
01:01:58,173 --> 01:01:58,662
Sister. . .

685
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:00,565
Did you see the paper, sister?

686
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,603
The cops have published my photo.

687
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:05,612
Sister. . .

688
01:02:06,281 --> 01:02:07,339
if the villagers see it. . .

689
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:09,208
what'll happen to Uma and the kids?

690
01:02:10,085 --> 01:02:10,881
That's life.

691
01:02:13,288 --> 01:02:14,016
Come. . .

692
01:02:14,489 --> 01:02:15,251
Velu has sent for you.

693
01:02:20,829 --> 01:02:21,818
Catch me, Mohan.

694
01:02:22,331 --> 01:02:23,821
Mother, look at Chinna.

695
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:25,861
Catch me.
- I will catch you now.

696
01:02:32,641 --> 01:02:34,404
Do you know
the government school in Mushelli?

697
01:02:35,644 --> 01:02:37,771
8 to 10 of you, launch an attack on it
tomorrow morning.

698
01:02:38,246 --> 01:02:38,974
Morning?

699
01:02:39,982 --> 01:02:40,710
Didn't you hear me?

700
01:02:43,452 --> 01:02:45,545
A huge consignment of weapons
will be arriving there tonight.

701
01:02:46,822 --> 01:02:47,880
A few cops will accompany it.

702
01:02:48,724 --> 01:02:50,954
Tomorrow morning,
get them before they leave.

703
01:02:51,626 --> 01:02:53,321
But why in a school, brother. . . ?

704
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,692
They think we won't attack a school.

705
01:02:56,598 --> 01:02:57,929
That's why they're storing
the weapons there.

706
01:02:58,133 --> 01:02:59,566
It involves risk to children's lives. . .
- Sister Saral. . .

707
01:03:02,437 --> 01:03:03,734
send 2 to 3 women
in plain clothes. . .

708
01:03:04,206 --> 01:03:05,366
and rescue as many children as possible.

709
01:03:07,542 --> 01:03:08,133
But remember. . .

710
01:03:09,978 --> 01:03:11,036
I want the weapons at any cost.

711
01:03:29,398 --> 01:03:32,629
''Fish is the queen of the water''

712
01:03:33,402 --> 01:03:36,337
''Water is it's life''

713
01:03:36,972 --> 01:03:39,907
''You touch it, it gets scared''

714
01:03:40,308 --> 01:03:42,708
''You remove it out, it dies''

715
01:04:13,608 --> 01:04:18,068
So children, when you multiple
5 by 4 you get 20.

716
01:04:18,747 --> 01:04:20,715
How much?
- 20.

717
01:04:21,316 --> 01:04:24,615
Right. Now multiply 7 by 7.

718
01:04:27,722 --> 01:04:29,280
All of you, write clearly.

719
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:32,789
Leave right now.
Quickly.

720
01:05:07,896 --> 01:05:09,056
Quickly!

721
01:05:15,737 --> 01:05:16,635
Wake up!

722
01:05:16,805 --> 01:05:17,772
Come, quickly!

723
01:06:01,616 --> 01:06:02,378
Catch this.

724
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:29,936
Narsimha !

725
01:06:57,572 --> 01:06:58,129
Come on.

726
01:07:54,663 --> 01:07:55,755
The information was right, brother Velu.

727
01:07:56,264 --> 01:07:57,253
It was exactly the way we presumed.

728
01:07:57,899 --> 01:07:59,127
We got at least 3 dozen rifles.

729
01:07:59,401 --> 01:08:01,369
12 boxes of grenades and
20 boxes of bullets.

730
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:04,099
Narsimha tried to save two children.

731
01:08:04,673 --> 01:08:07,642
But regretfully, one of them was hit and. . .

732
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:10,370
Narsimha couldn't take it.

733
01:08:11,579 --> 01:08:12,477
He fell unconscious.

734
01:08:13,581 --> 01:08:15,048
We somehow brought him here.

735
01:08:15,283 --> 01:08:16,045
Papa !

736
01:08:17,986 --> 01:08:19,954
Papa !
- Papa !

737
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:21,214
Chinna.

738
01:08:21,756 --> 01:08:23,314
Papa !

739
01:08:24,059 --> 01:08:25,117
Papa !

740
01:08:25,327 --> 01:08:26,589
Papa !
- Chinna.

741
01:08:30,298 --> 01:08:30,787
Chinna. . .

742
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:36,837
Mohan. . .

743
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,403
Chinna. . .

744
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:42,710
It's been two days,
his fever hasn't come down yet?

745
01:08:43,978 --> 01:08:45,741
The school incident
has affected him deeply.

746
01:08:47,649 --> 01:08:48,616
Shall we get a doctor?

747
01:09:04,232 --> 01:09:05,563
He hasn't eaten anything
since two days.

748
01:09:06,101 --> 01:09:07,728
Could we get him admitted
to a hospital. . .

749
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,980
It needs to be changed
every 3 to 4 hours.

750
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:24,683
Is there somebody who can do it?
- I'll do it.

751
01:09:35,096 --> 01:09:35,858
Bloody chicken !

752
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:42,527
Don't tell anybody outside.

753
01:09:43,071 --> 01:09:43,730
Okay.

754
01:10:00,221 --> 01:10:01,119
Chinna !

755
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:04,416
Mohan !

756
01:10:06,261 --> 01:10:06,818
Chinna.

757
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:10,094
Mohan.

758
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:16,701
Chinna. . . !

759
01:10:18,373 --> 01:10:21,536
Mohan. . . !

760
01:10:24,012 --> 01:10:24,774
Mohan. . . !

761
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:26,308
Chinna !

762
01:10:27,115 --> 01:10:28,104
You betrayed us.

763
01:10:29,184 --> 01:10:30,481
You killed Chinna and Mohan.

764
01:10:33,721 --> 01:10:34,915
You killed Chinna and Mohan !

765
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:39,459
Uma !
- Narsimha. . . !

766
01:10:40,261 --> 01:10:41,091
What happened, Narsimha?

767
01:10:42,197 --> 01:10:44,495
Narsimha !
- I killed my children.

768
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:48,358
I killed them. . .

769
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:51,031
No, you didn't kill them.
- Yes.

770
01:10:51,539 --> 01:10:53,473
You didn't. . .
- Yes, I did kill my children

771
01:10:54,209 --> 01:10:54,937
No, Narsimha.

772
01:10:57,078 --> 01:10:59,239
You didn't kill any child.
You saved a child.

773
01:11:03,184 --> 01:11:03,980
I killed my children.

774
01:11:11,259 --> 01:11:11,816
What happened?

775
01:11:13,061 --> 01:11:14,551
Nothing.

776
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:19,723
Narsimha. . .

777
01:11:21,936 --> 01:11:23,460
I know that you care for me.

778
01:11:45,026 --> 01:11:45,890
Lakshmi. . .

779
01:11:49,898 --> 01:11:53,698
Lakshmi, I have nothing to give you.

780
01:11:55,537 --> 01:11:56,629
Nothing at all.

781
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:04,305
Your wife. . .

782
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:07,169
is very fortunate.

783
01:12:22,864 --> 01:12:24,331
I want to go to my children.

784
01:12:28,069 --> 01:12:31,903
I want to go to my wife.
I'll tell brother Velu. . .

785
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:35,306
I'll tell him that I want to leave.

786
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:36,369
Narsimha !

787
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:55,520
Brother. . .
- So are you finally done with the woman?

788
01:12:56,998 --> 01:12:59,990
I want to talk to you.
- Not now.

789
01:13:01,202 --> 01:13:01,759
Tomorrow.

790
01:13:04,172 --> 01:13:07,630
Brother, I can't handle this anymore.

791
01:13:10,345 --> 01:13:11,471
Good for nothing.

792
01:13:13,448 --> 01:13:14,506
I knew it all the time.

793
01:13:14,882 --> 01:13:19,080
Brother, I came here to earn money
for my children's education. . .

794
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,582
not for my grandchildren.

795
01:13:22,090 --> 01:13:24,320
So many months have passed
without anything.

796
01:13:25,259 --> 01:13:27,727
You keep postponing paying money. . .
- Money! !

797
01:13:28,563 --> 01:13:29,894
Money. . . money! Damn it!

798
01:13:31,799 --> 01:13:32,458
I know it

799
01:13:33,935 --> 01:13:35,402
Those bloody cops.

800
01:13:36,838 --> 01:13:38,430
How much money did they give you
to leave us?

801
01:13:38,973 --> 01:13:40,565
There nothing of that sort, brother.
- Come on, tell me.

802
01:13:41,909 --> 01:13:43,376
How much money did you take
to betray our outfit?

803
01:13:43,611 --> 01:13:45,704
That's not true, brother
- Come on. Tell me.

804
01:13:45,913 --> 01:13:47,107
That's baseless, brother.

805
01:13:47,248 --> 01:13:49,614
Come on, tell me how much
did you sell out for?

806
01:13:50,018 --> 01:13:50,643
No, brother.

807
01:13:52,086 --> 01:13:54,281
I just want to live in peacen, brother.

808
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:57,518
I'll not speak a word to anybody. . .

809
01:13:58,059 --> 01:13:59,959
about our outfit. . .
- Damn, you !

810
01:14:02,096 --> 01:14:03,063
Do I look like a fool to you?

811
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:06,359
You think I am a fool?

812
01:14:10,338 --> 01:14:10,997
I'm leaving.

813
01:14:26,354 --> 01:14:27,082
What happened?

814
01:14:27,689 --> 01:14:28,849
Where did this gun shot come from?

815
01:14:36,831 --> 01:14:37,729
Narsimha.

816
01:14:40,668 --> 01:14:41,692
Narsimha, what have you done?

817
01:14:42,403 --> 01:14:44,064
Narsimha. . . ? Narsimha. . .

818
01:14:45,339 --> 01:14:47,364
Go away, Narsimha. Flee!
Leave this to me.

819
01:14:47,809 --> 01:14:49,367
Take a look there.
- You go this side.

820
01:14:53,381 --> 01:14:54,177
Narsimha. . .

821
01:14:55,049 --> 01:14:56,016
Get going, Narsimha. Go!

822
01:14:56,984 --> 01:14:59,248
No, not from there.
Go from here.

823
01:15:06,728 --> 01:15:08,093
Where was the gunshot fired?

824
01:15:09,797 --> 01:15:11,196
Look there! Look there.

825
01:15:13,367 --> 01:15:14,026
Who is it?

826
01:15:14,168 --> 01:15:14,827
Lakshmi !

827
01:15:28,916 --> 01:15:29,541
Brother Velu?

828
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:31,549
What happened?

829
01:15:33,855 --> 01:15:36,653
I killed him.

830
01:15:38,526 --> 01:15:40,926
I took Velu to be different.

831
01:15:43,631 --> 01:15:46,464
But all men are alike.

832
01:16:22,303 --> 01:16:23,702
I've known him for years.

833
01:16:24,739 --> 01:16:27,435
Velu never misbehaved with any woman.

834
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:30,835
But, his feelings were
different for Lakshmi.

835
01:16:31,779 --> 01:16:32,268
Brother Murli.

836
01:16:34,348 --> 01:16:36,714
Narsimha is not to be seen.
- Where could he be?

837
01:16:57,672 --> 01:16:58,331
Greetings.

838
01:17:14,822 --> 01:17:15,686
Sir, your change.

839
01:17:17,491 --> 01:17:18,116
Lakshmi. . .

840
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:19,923
do you know where's Narsimha?

841
01:17:24,699 --> 01:17:26,530
He went home in the evening. . .

842
01:17:28,135 --> 01:17:29,363
to meet his wife and children.

843
01:17:35,676 --> 01:17:36,734
Soma !
- Yes, brother.

844
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:39,942
I want Narsimha.

845
01:17:40,748 --> 01:17:42,272
Go and get him after the last rites.
- Yes, brother.

846
01:17:44,952 --> 01:17:47,182
Brother, everyone is panicked.

847
01:17:47,922 --> 01:17:51,688
We will have to tell them something.
- Gather everyone. I will talk to them.

848
01:17:52,059 --> 01:17:52,616
Yes.

849
01:17:53,427 --> 01:17:55,122
And you tell Radha
to take Mani along. . .

850
01:17:55,863 --> 01:17:57,455
and inform comrade Krishnaraj
about this incident.

851
01:17:58,065 --> 01:17:58,622
Yes.

852
01:18:27,595 --> 01:18:28,653
Hello!
- Hello Raghavan, brother.

853
01:18:29,297 --> 01:18:29,888
This is Narsimha.

854
01:18:30,364 --> 01:18:32,389
Narsimha?
- Brother, we. . .

855
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,325
met at Velu's outfit.
Do you recollect Narsimah, brother?

856
01:18:36,704 --> 01:18:37,534
Who is it?
- Narsimha.

857
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:39,070
Just a minute.

858
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:41,565
Brother. . . brother. . .

859
01:19:24,986 --> 01:19:25,918
An unfortunate incident. . .

860
01:19:26,921 --> 01:19:28,821
has snatched brother Velu
from us, forever.

861
01:19:30,124 --> 01:19:32,786
But let us not jump to any conclusions.

862
01:19:34,128 --> 01:19:35,527
We are trying to investigate. . .

863
01:19:36,130 --> 01:19:36,994
this incident.

864
01:19:38,065 --> 01:19:39,623
But if anyone knows anything at all. .

865
01:19:40,534 --> 01:19:41,262
then do tell me.

866
01:19:42,169 --> 01:19:44,763
Start packing after his last rites.

867
01:19:45,706 --> 01:19:47,799
We will shift our camp
at the crack of the dawn.

868
01:19:49,377 --> 01:19:53,473
Now. . . we will pay homage
to this true soldier of our war.

869
01:19:55,282 --> 01:19:56,010
Red salute!

870
01:19:56,884 --> 01:19:57,782
Red salute!

871
01:20:04,291 --> 01:20:05,019
Red salute.

872
01:20:35,423 --> 01:20:36,253
Uma !

873
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:07,484
Uma. . .

874
01:21:08,289 --> 01:21:09,085
Uma. . .

875
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:11,114
Uma ! Uma, get off at Manaswadi.

876
01:21:11,425 --> 01:21:12,289
That would be around
5 or 6 in the morning.

877
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:13,357
Then proceed to Guntur.

878
01:21:13,861 --> 01:21:16,125
You are carrying
brother Raghavan's address. . . isn't it?

879
01:21:16,831 --> 01:21:18,423
I've informed him.

880
01:21:18,766 --> 01:21:22,167
I'll join you as soon as things cool down.
I'll come, children.

881
01:21:22,303 --> 01:21:25,204
You also come with us, papa.
- I'll come later.

882
01:21:26,574 --> 01:21:27,700
You'll meet us in Guntur for sure?

883
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:30,904
I'll come in few days.

884
01:21:48,295 --> 01:21:48,989
Brother Murli. . .

885
01:21:53,367 --> 01:21:55,335
Brother Murli, I think Narsimha has fled.

886
01:21:56,337 --> 01:21:58,430
One jeep is missing and
there's no one at his house.

887
01:22:00,608 --> 01:22:01,973
I've checked out everything.

888
01:22:07,581 --> 01:22:08,275
I got to know. . .

889
01:22:10,417 --> 01:22:11,543
this matter is not as simple as it seems.

890
01:22:13,487 --> 01:22:15,182
Surely, something happened
between the three of them.

891
01:22:18,025 --> 01:22:19,492
Aren't you keeping something
from us about Velu?

892
01:22:24,131 --> 01:22:27,726
Where's Narsimha?
- Let us know, for the good.

893
01:22:30,171 --> 01:22:31,468
If I wish, I can kill you right now,

894
01:22:33,607 --> 01:22:35,131
But we have some rules
with regard to women.

895
01:22:37,311 --> 01:22:38,972
If you ;re speaking the truth,
then your fate will be decided. . .

896
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:40,112
by comrade Krishanraj.

897
01:22:42,883 --> 01:22:44,111
Mani ! Muthu !
- Yes?

898
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:46,242
Form groups of five and
look for Narsimha.

899
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:49,279
We'll have to shift the camp to Madanpalya.
- Okay, brother.

900
01:23:22,723 --> 01:23:23,382
There's no other option. . .

901
01:23:23,557 --> 01:23:24,489
but to kill Narsimha.

902
01:23:26,293 --> 01:23:26,987
Go straight.

903
01:23:28,495 --> 01:23:29,154
Straight ahead.

904
01:23:58,892 --> 01:24:00,723
Can I get omelette and tea?
- Sit.

905
01:24:03,097 --> 01:24:03,791
Raju.

906
01:24:05,366 --> 01:24:06,128
Raju !

907
01:24:06,934 --> 01:24:07,923
Wake up!

908
01:24:14,475 --> 01:24:15,134
Hey!

909
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:17,274
Make to two teas.

910
01:24:18,045 --> 01:24:18,636
Quickly!

911
01:24:19,046 --> 01:24:20,035
I said, make tea.

912
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:22,508
You are wasting time. Make it fast.

913
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:25,080
One minute, sir
Sir, please sit inside.

914
01:24:33,027 --> 01:24:34,426
Don't be miserly with the sugar.

915
01:24:35,763 --> 01:24:37,788
Where are you going?
Your omelette is ready.

916
01:24:38,966 --> 01:24:39,864
Sir, your order?

917
01:24:43,971 --> 01:24:44,995
Sir. . . it's ready!

918
01:24:55,316 --> 01:24:56,180
Where?
- Right.

919
01:24:57,184 --> 01:24:58,845
Sir, Naxals' jeep was spotted in Patehalli.

920
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:03,083
It seems this person could be one of
the Mac Iron case suspects.

921
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:05,885
Send a force there right away.
- Right, sir.

922
01:25:06,593 --> 01:25:07,719
Hello, send the force immediately.

923
01:25:22,609 --> 01:25:24,008
''The hunt is on. ''

924
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:25,802
''Their swords are drawn. ''

925
01:25:25,913 --> 01:25:28,438
''They are on the prowl, for you''

926
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:32,379
''No one knows it,
There's no assurance. . . ''

927
01:25:32,519 --> 01:25:35,317
''this life hangs by a thread. ''

928
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:37,849
''Where do these roads lead?''

929
01:25:39,026 --> 01:25:40,857
''I have no inkling of my fate. ''

930
01:25:41,295 --> 01:25:44,264
''O, what my fate has in store?''

931
01:25:45,065 --> 01:25:47,659
''My mind riddles me. . . ''

932
01:25:48,902 --> 01:25:51,200
''Will the dark night ever end?''

933
01:25:52,172 --> 01:25:54,231
''Will I see the dawn again?''

934
01:25:58,812 --> 01:26:04,648
''What has life come to?''

935
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:12,752
''Why this mist
has engulfed me?''

936
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:17,389
''Where have the roads
of hope disappeared?''

937
01:26:18,098 --> 01:26:20,726
''Is this, what life is worth?''

938
01:26:21,435 --> 01:26:23,596
''The heart yearns to know. ''

939
01:26:27,408 --> 01:26:28,670
'I was on the run for 3 days. '

940
01:26:29,576 --> 01:26:30,565
'Anywhere, at any time. . . '

941
01:26:31,578 --> 01:26:32,738
'they could have killed me. '

942
01:26:33,847 --> 01:26:35,144
'This fear kept me awake at nights. '

943
01:26:36,216 --> 01:26:37,740
'There was no news about
Uma and the children. '

944
01:26:38,752 --> 01:26:40,014
'Nor any concern
about hunger and thirst. '

945
01:26:40,888 --> 01:26:41,650
'Because every step. . . '

946
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:43,880
'every moment was a boon of life. '

947
01:26:54,535 --> 01:26:55,194
Contact headquarters.

948
01:27:18,792 --> 01:27:19,281
Hey!

949
01:27:20,694 --> 01:27:23,788
I was thinking of sleeping. . . for a while.

950
01:27:23,931 --> 01:27:26,525
But it looks like
that I am already asleep.

951
01:27:27,734 --> 01:27:29,326
Now it's time to wake up.

952
01:27:30,003 --> 01:27:30,594
Oh, my God !

953
01:27:32,039 --> 01:27:33,472
Hey, Naga, wake up.

954
01:27:34,608 --> 01:27:35,199
Hey. . . !

955
01:27:39,079 --> 01:27:40,376
You can't be Naga.

956
01:27:40,481 --> 01:27:44,645
Naga doesn't play with guns.
He enjoys with the bottle.

957
01:27:45,819 --> 01:27:48,788
Drink up! Make merry!

958
01:27:50,257 --> 01:27:51,053
Aren't you. . .

959
01:27:52,092 --> 01:27:52,751
Naga Reddy?

960
01:27:55,028 --> 01:27:57,155
That's right. I'm Naga.

961
01:27:58,098 --> 01:27:58,962
But, who are you?

962
01:27:59,299 --> 01:28:00,596
I'm Narsimha. 'Narsu'.

963
01:28:01,001 --> 01:28:02,992
We use to study in the same school.

964
01:28:04,271 --> 01:28:05,568
Oh. . .

965
01:28:05,839 --> 01:28:07,363
Narsu !
- Yes!

966
01:28:09,109 --> 01:28:12,237
You ran away with my books in grade 5.

967
01:28:14,081 --> 01:28:16,845
I waited for three years
in the same grade for you.

968
01:28:17,084 --> 01:28:18,517
But you never returned.

969
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:21,885
Now you've stolen my cot too.

970
01:28:22,155 --> 01:28:25,352
Naga. . . the cops are after me.
They'll kill me.

971
01:28:26,293 --> 01:28:27,260
Help me, Naga.

972
01:28:27,694 --> 01:28:31,130
You are still playing 'cops and robbers'.

973
01:28:31,365 --> 01:28:32,354
Help me hide.

974
01:28:34,835 --> 01:28:35,927
Can you get inside this bottle?

975
01:28:37,204 --> 01:28:39,297
Naga, if the cops arrive,
they'll kill us both.

976
01:28:39,473 --> 01:28:40,167
Hey. . . !

977
01:28:41,174 --> 01:28:43,108
You realise what you've done?

978
01:28:43,810 --> 01:28:45,300
It's such a big loss.

979
01:28:46,346 --> 01:28:50,043
I was on cloud nine, you grounded me.

980
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:54,715
Hey. . . are you. . .

981
01:28:55,122 --> 01:28:55,918
a Naxalite?

982
01:28:58,692 --> 01:28:59,624
I use to be, brother.

983
01:29:00,093 --> 01:29:02,527
That's why the Cops and the Naxals
both are after me.

984
01:29:03,263 --> 01:29:04,059
Save me, Naga.

985
01:29:05,766 --> 01:29:11,136
Enemies on both sides.
You are doomed for sure.

986
01:29:16,009 --> 01:29:17,306
Can't figure out what to do.

987
01:29:18,111 --> 01:29:20,102
I'm worried about my wife and children.

988
01:29:21,682 --> 01:29:22,614
It's simple.

989
01:29:23,016 --> 01:29:25,814
Join one and. . . fight the other.

990
01:29:26,086 --> 01:29:28,111
The chances of
securing your life gets even.

991
01:29:28,622 --> 01:29:30,487
If you are lucky. . .

992
01:29:31,458 --> 01:29:33,858
you'll live and the others will be. . .

993
01:29:34,061 --> 01:29:34,584
dead.

994
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:39,295
Look. . . please don't mind.

995
01:29:39,433 --> 01:29:40,422
But I. . .

996
01:29:40,834 --> 01:29:43,496
can't keep you. . . here tonight.

997
01:29:43,637 --> 01:29:44,899
Just for a night.
- No. . . no. . .

998
01:29:45,038 --> 01:29:47,404
I can't put my family in danger.
- I'll leave in the morning.

999
01:29:47,541 --> 01:29:48,803
No way.

1000
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:50,100
Naga. . .

1001
01:29:51,211 --> 01:29:52,200
Naga. . . Naga. . .

1002
01:29:52,579 --> 01:29:53,807
keep this. Okay?

1003
01:29:54,615 --> 01:29:57,015
Buy yourself a drink.
And get me some food. . .

1004
01:29:58,018 --> 01:30:01,476
and a pair of clothes.
- Okay, fine.

1005
01:30:01,888 --> 01:30:04,254
You can be here till tomorrow night.
Okay?

1006
01:30:04,791 --> 01:30:05,450
Only till tomorrow night.

1007
01:30:05,759 --> 01:30:08,489
You may sleep now. . .

1008
01:30:09,296 --> 01:30:12,697
I'll be back soon.
You sleep. . .

1009
01:30:36,089 --> 01:30:37,647
Had it been you in my place. . .

1010
01:30:40,293 --> 01:30:41,317
what'd you have done?

1011
01:30:42,529 --> 01:30:43,427
I am leaving.

1012
01:31:05,352 --> 01:31:06,444
There's only one way out.

1013
01:31:08,488 --> 01:31:10,820
Become an informer,
and the cops. . .

1014
01:31:12,359 --> 01:31:13,451
will pardon you.

1015
01:31:15,162 --> 01:31:18,689
They're my comrades,
I can't betray them.

1016
01:31:19,499 --> 01:31:21,729
Will they spare you if you go back?

1017
01:31:24,004 --> 01:31:25,631
What have they done
except killing innocent people?

1018
01:31:27,374 --> 01:31:28,432
They attacked a school.

1019
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:31,841
So many children's lives were endangered.

1020
01:31:33,013 --> 01:31:34,378
Even you killed a child.

1021
01:31:34,815 --> 01:31:37,249
God knows, I was trying to rescue her.

1022
01:31:38,452 --> 01:31:39,146
Who'll hear you out?

1023
01:31:40,487 --> 01:31:41,419
Who'll believe you?

1024
01:31:42,823 --> 01:31:44,085
You call yourselves revolutionaries.

1025
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:49,687
But for the world. . . for the media. . .
you are terrorists.

1026
01:31:53,333 --> 01:31:55,733
Okay, brother.
I'll reveal everything.

1027
01:31:56,903 --> 01:31:58,268
But my comrades. . .

1028
01:31:59,072 --> 01:31:59,970
shouldn't be harmed.

1029
01:32:00,574 --> 01:32:01,165
I'll try.

1030
01:32:02,976 --> 01:32:06,639
I'll arrange a meeting with
Surendra and Rathod.

1031
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:08,208
I won't talk to the police.

1032
01:32:09,549 --> 01:32:10,140
I'll. . .

1033
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:12,242
speak only to the Home Minister.

1034
01:32:13,019 --> 01:32:14,179
Home Minister. . .

1035
01:32:14,721 --> 01:32:17,019
It's not so easy
to speak with him, Narsimha.

1036
01:32:18,725 --> 01:32:20,625
Your wife and children
are at my home.

1037
01:32:22,362 --> 01:32:23,761
How long will I be able to save them?

1038
01:32:28,401 --> 01:32:29,060
I know. . .

1039
01:32:30,403 --> 01:32:32,598
But I'll only talk
to the Home Minister.

1040
01:32:36,543 --> 01:32:37,976
Call me after two hours.

1041
01:32:38,879 --> 01:32:40,403
I'll have a word with Rathod.

1042
01:32:42,482 --> 01:32:43,881
You will come along, won't you?

1043
01:32:52,893 --> 01:32:53,484
Strange!

1044
01:32:54,995 --> 01:32:55,893
What makes you give me
so much respect?

1045
01:32:57,898 --> 01:32:59,525
There's an important news for you.

1046
01:33:01,635 --> 01:33:03,193
Since when have you
started helping the police.

1047
01:33:04,538 --> 01:33:07,132
You are as good as
an unofficial Naxal.

1048
01:33:08,742 --> 01:33:10,266
One has to move with the times.

1049
01:33:11,411 --> 01:33:13,436
This news is for your benefit.

1050
01:33:16,817 --> 01:33:17,613
Opportunist.

1051
01:33:18,752 --> 01:33:19,878
We both stand to gain.

1052
01:33:37,204 --> 01:33:39,229
Narsimha.
The one whom I spoke about.

1053
01:33:40,574 --> 01:33:41,404
The one who killed Velu.

1054
01:33:43,577 --> 01:33:44,305
Greetings.

1055
01:33:46,179 --> 01:33:47,407
How can you help us?

1056
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:51,877
I can tell you everything about the outfit.

1057
01:33:53,753 --> 01:33:54,481
What do you want?

1058
01:33:55,956 --> 01:33:57,480
Security for me and my family.

1059
01:33:58,625 --> 01:33:59,387
Some money. . .

1060
01:34:01,061 --> 01:34:02,790
and. . . no harm to the outfit.

1061
01:34:03,063 --> 01:34:04,724
Yes, I have told them.
- Okay.

1062
01:34:05,832 --> 01:34:08,926
How can we trust you?
- He came here of his own accord.

1063
01:34:11,004 --> 01:34:11,629
Yes.

1064
01:34:19,846 --> 01:34:21,279
I'll call for you.
- Okay.

1065
01:34:23,283 --> 01:34:23,806
Come.

1066
01:34:32,826 --> 01:34:35,761
If he delivers what he says
then it'll lessen our woes.

1067
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:38,695
And give credibilty to the government.

1068
01:34:40,367 --> 01:34:42,528
As it is the government
spends a lot on such missions.

1069
01:34:44,871 --> 01:34:48,363
Winning is a far off thing.
We aren't tactful enough to fight them.

1070
01:34:50,777 --> 01:34:54,042
It'll be better if we can trap the big fish
along with the small ones.

1071
01:34:57,250 --> 01:34:59,480
You mean Krishnaraj?
- He's the main guy.

1072
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:08,384
Send them in.
Yes.

1073
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:14,289
Sir. . .

1074
01:35:15,802 --> 01:35:17,997
Can you. . .
- Yes?

1075
01:35:20,073 --> 01:35:21,438
. . . lead us to Krishnaraj?

1076
01:35:23,276 --> 01:35:24,265
Yes. . .
- Kri. . .

1077
01:35:27,914 --> 01:35:29,245
I'll try.

1078
01:35:30,283 --> 01:35:31,443
But first my demands
should be met.

1079
01:35:33,053 --> 01:35:33,451
Yes.

1080
01:35:41,261 --> 01:35:43,354
Inform Sudhakar.
Tell him to meet me.

1081
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:52,337
Okay, it will be done.

1082
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:04,646
Yes, Raghavan !
You'll get the news first.

1083
01:36:05,752 --> 01:36:07,219
Even you are awaiting
an editor's post.

1084
01:36:24,637 --> 01:36:25,763
Uma ! They have come.

1085
01:36:35,615 --> 01:36:36,877
Papa !

1086
01:37:07,781 --> 01:37:08,713
No idea when this rain will stop. . .

1087
01:37:08,848 --> 01:37:10,372
and when will we leave for Madanpalya.

1088
01:38:17,617 --> 01:38:18,481
Satya.

1089
01:38:20,353 --> 01:38:21,115
Sonamai. . .

1090
01:38:21,888 --> 01:38:22,718
Ayyappa.

1091
01:38:27,260 --> 01:38:28,056
Ananya,

1092
01:38:30,930 --> 01:38:31,658
Raju.

1093
01:38:35,835 --> 01:38:36,563
Pindappa.

1094
01:38:41,508 --> 01:38:42,133
Murli. . .

1095
01:38:44,544 --> 01:38:45,374
brother. . . !

1096
01:38:48,948 --> 01:38:49,642
Sister Radha

1097
01:38:55,021 --> 01:38:55,817
Sister Saral.

1098
01:39:00,326 --> 01:39:01,020
Soma !

1099
01:39:11,271 --> 01:39:11,999
Soma. . .

1100
01:39:26,619 --> 01:39:27,608
These people have been arrested.

1101
01:39:31,758 --> 01:39:34,727
Sir. . . Is Lakshmi amongst them?

1102
01:39:36,196 --> 01:39:37,356
She was brought in last night.

1103
01:39:38,298 --> 01:39:38,855
Is she here?

1104
01:39:40,667 --> 01:39:43,261
Can I. . . meet Lakshmi?

1105
01:39:50,076 --> 01:39:52,442
How did this happen?
How come no one noticed?

1106
01:39:52,579 --> 01:39:53,807
We don't know, we didn't hear anything.

1107
01:39:54,013 --> 01:39:55,571
What are we to report?
- We were here.

1108
01:39:55,682 --> 01:39:57,172
What's happening here?
- We didn't get know

1109
01:39:57,383 --> 01:39:58,441
A prisioner committed suicide.

1110
01:39:59,085 --> 01:40:00,177
How did this happen?
- Lakshmi !

1111
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:01,309
I don't know sir.
- No idea sir. . .

1112
01:40:06,359 --> 01:40:07,257
Get her down.

1113
01:40:38,157 --> 01:40:39,681
'I know why Lakshmi killed herself. '

1114
01:40:41,427 --> 01:40:44,089
'She didn't want to be ravaged
by these brutes again. '

1115
01:40:45,665 --> 01:40:48,133
'Now it wasn't just the question of
the safety of my family. ''

1116
01:40:49,769 --> 01:40:52,067
'It also concerns
those hundreds of innocents. . . '

1117
01:40:53,273 --> 01:40:55,935
'who are being killed
in this war everyday. '

1118
01:40:58,077 --> 01:41:00,011
'There was only one way out of this. '

1119
01:41:01,547 --> 01:41:02,673
'The end of Krishnaraj. '

1120
01:41:03,483 --> 01:41:04,177
Yes.

1121
01:41:07,787 --> 01:41:08,845
He agreed with great difficulty.

1122
01:41:09,489 --> 01:41:11,081
I've been called to
the Nalamala jungle tomorrow.

1123
01:41:12,292 --> 01:41:13,657
3 commando units will go along.

1124
01:41:14,427 --> 01:41:15,018
No, sir.

1125
01:41:15,561 --> 01:41:16,493
He's expecting me alone.

1126
01:41:17,764 --> 01:41:19,197
If he smells something fishy, then. . .

1127
01:41:19,399 --> 01:41:19,922
we'll miss him.

1128
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:21,790
I'm not sending you there
for an interview.

1129
01:41:23,102 --> 01:41:24,660
I want Krishnaraj dead or alive.

1130
01:41:26,406 --> 01:41:27,236
I can get there.

1131
01:41:29,942 --> 01:41:31,409
No one will know.

1132
01:41:35,081 --> 01:41:36,878
Narsimha, it's risky.

1133
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:37,807
Yes.

1134
01:41:39,619 --> 01:41:40,608
But I can't take it anymore.

1135
01:41:42,255 --> 01:41:43,187
I want to end it all.

1136
01:41:50,496 --> 01:41:53,488
You'll go there alone.
We'll cover you from a distance.

1137
01:41:54,467 --> 01:41:55,024
Alright.

1138
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:07,974
It's official.

1139
01:42:27,266 --> 01:42:29,894
How much further?
- A little more. Across the lake.

1140
01:42:41,381 --> 01:42:43,315
Across the lake.
- There?

1141
01:42:44,684 --> 01:42:46,117
Carefully.
- Yes.

1142
01:43:10,009 --> 01:43:11,533
Hey! Shivananda. . . what happened?

1143
01:43:12,278 --> 01:43:13,210
Who fired the. . .

1144
01:43:20,186 --> 01:43:20,709
You !

1145
01:43:23,122 --> 01:43:24,111
I should've thought. . .

1146
01:43:25,491 --> 01:43:26,788
Raghavan might ploy.

1147
01:43:30,730 --> 01:43:32,129
Weren't you the one who said to me. . .

1148
01:43:33,966 --> 01:43:35,934
'What do we gain by killing people?'

1149
01:43:37,937 --> 01:43:39,029
Even you've killed people.

1150
01:43:40,139 --> 01:43:42,437
Haven't you?
That too, your own people.

1151
01:43:44,010 --> 01:43:45,034
Velu, Murli. . .

1152
01:43:45,578 --> 01:43:46,840
Sister Radha, sister Saral,

1153
01:43:49,649 --> 01:43:50,513
What did you gain from it?

1154
01:43:53,152 --> 01:43:54,141
This is what you said that day. . .

1155
01:43:56,255 --> 01:43:58,883
'It's our people on both the sides, sir. '

1156
01:44:00,660 --> 01:44:01,957
'What will we gain by bloodshed?'

1157
01:44:03,196 --> 01:44:04,094
Isn't that what you said?

1158
01:44:06,566 --> 01:44:07,498
One is forced to do so. . .

1159
01:44:08,835 --> 01:44:09,699
at times.

1160
01:44:57,116 --> 01:44:58,515
That's his watch.

1161
01:45:02,221 --> 01:45:02,915
Spectacles too.

1162
01:45:12,331 --> 01:45:13,491
Even the ring belongs to him.

1163
01:45:18,437 --> 01:45:19,802
It will be tomorrow's breaking news. . .

1164
01:45:21,374 --> 01:45:23,342
'D.I. G. Rathod kills the Naxal leader. . . '

1165
01:45:24,410 --> 01:45:26,605
'Krishnaraj,
in a dramatic encounter. '

1166
01:45:34,687 --> 01:45:35,176
Finally!

1167
01:45:44,664 --> 01:45:46,131
Mohan stop. Mohan stop.

1168
01:45:46,265 --> 01:45:46,924
I will go first.

1169
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:49,061
Be careful, child.

1170
01:45:49,368 --> 01:45:50,266
I will go first, Mohan.

1171
01:45:50,403 --> 01:45:52,234
Listen ! Listen !
- Mohan !

1172
01:45:52,405 --> 01:45:54,703
Don't come in the house
with the shoes.

1173
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:56,569
Take off your bags. Quickly.

1174
01:45:57,109 --> 01:45:58,371
Wash up and have some snacks.

1175
01:45:58,544 --> 01:45:59,238
Chinna, you too.

1176
01:45:59,445 --> 01:46:00,912
So, how was your day
at the school?

1177
01:46:01,314 --> 01:46:02,440
Good.
- Really!

1178
01:46:02,715 --> 01:46:04,182
Mine was even better.
- Is it?

1179
01:46:04,383 --> 01:46:05,372
Yes.
- How come?

1180
01:46:05,618 --> 01:46:08,951
Because I didn't get any homework.
So, I can play today.

1181
01:46:09,055 --> 01:46:10,818
Just because you didn't get homework,
school was good. - Yes.

1182
01:46:11,123 --> 01:46:13,250
Did you get homework?
- Yes, I got.

1183
01:46:13,359 --> 01:46:14,087
Oh !

1184
01:46:14,327 --> 01:46:16,522
Wow, now you can't play.
- I will play.

1185
01:46:16,596 --> 01:46:17,756
Okay, you can play too.

1186
01:46:17,797 --> 01:46:19,765
'We continue our conversation with. . . '
- Wait. . . just a minute. . .

1187
01:46:19,932 --> 01:46:21,957
'the CEO of the Indian division of
Anderson Agro Foods. . . '

1188
01:46:22,201 --> 01:46:23,566
'Mr. Krishnamachari Shrikant. '

1189
01:46:24,003 --> 01:46:25,800
Keep quite for a minute, son.

1190
01:46:26,005 --> 01:46:28,200
Hush. . . Listen. . .

1191
01:46:28,341 --> 01:46:30,775
You do your homework, I'll play.

1192
01:46:30,843 --> 01:46:32,208
No, no. . .
- Uma. . . Uma. . .

1193
01:46:32,311 --> 01:46:33,938
Go to the other channel,
the previous one. . .

1194
01:46:34,113 --> 01:46:36,206
You both please go and
change your clothes. Okay?

1195
01:46:36,616 --> 01:46:37,446
Surf back, Uma.

1196
01:46:37,617 --> 01:46:39,414
This one?
- Surf backwards. The other one.

1197
01:46:41,654 --> 01:46:42,086
Is it this?

1198
01:46:42,321 --> 01:46:43,686
We are bound to get tax benefits.

1199
01:46:44,090 --> 01:46:44,715
Yes. That's the one.

1200
01:46:45,091 --> 01:46:47,616
Because that area is declared
economically backward area.

1201
01:46:48,961 --> 01:46:51,896
But our aim was not
just getting tax benefits.

1202
01:46:52,999 --> 01:46:55,991
We want the area to prosper.

1203
01:46:56,769 --> 01:46:58,202
Provide employment to the locals. . .

1204
01:46:59,038 --> 01:47:00,164
to overcome poverty.

1205
01:47:00,906 --> 01:47:02,100
Education to their children.

1206
01:47:02,775 --> 01:47:04,003
There will be lot of benefits

1207
01:47:04,510 --> 01:47:05,477
'This is what you said that day. . . '

1208
01:47:06,012 --> 01:47:08,105
'It's our people on both the sides, sir. '

1209
01:47:10,182 --> 01:47:11,308
What will we gain by bloodshed?

1210
01:47:14,453 --> 01:47:15,249
Isn't that what you said?

1211
01:47:17,423 --> 01:47:18,287
One is forced to do so. . .

1212
01:47:19,659 --> 01:47:20,284
at times.

1213
01:47:30,202 --> 01:47:31,328
You came here to kill me, isn't it?

1214
01:47:32,538 --> 01:47:33,129
Kill me.

1215
01:47:35,241 --> 01:47:37,232
Because these pigs won't get me alive.

1216
01:47:39,545 --> 01:47:41,240
I have been a part of this movement
for the past 35 years.

1217
01:47:43,449 --> 01:47:44,939
And lived with the belief. . .

1218
01:47:46,986 --> 01:47:48,044
that without violence. . .

1219
01:47:50,389 --> 01:47:52,687
our cries couldn't be heard
by the government.

1220
01:47:56,929 --> 01:47:59,056
All these years it didn't occur to us. . .

1221
01:48:00,466 --> 01:48:02,593
That the path that we have taken,
it leads. . .

1222
01:48:03,736 --> 01:48:04,600
to nowhere.

1223
01:48:07,006 --> 01:48:07,995
But now I am assured. . .

1224
01:48:10,509 --> 01:48:11,976
that we are riding a tiger. . .

1225
01:48:13,079 --> 01:48:14,307
which can't be controlled by us. . .

1226
01:48:15,815 --> 01:48:17,214
nor we can get off from it.

1227
01:48:18,384 --> 01:48:19,351
It's also clear. . .

1228
01:48:20,252 --> 01:48:21,719
that merely on
the basis of principles. . .

1229
01:48:22,722 --> 01:48:24,019
we cannot fight battles.

1230
01:48:25,758 --> 01:48:28,488
I was thinking. . .
that in this battle. . .

1231
01:48:29,195 --> 01:48:30,594
we went underground from enemies.

1232
01:48:32,565 --> 01:48:33,554
But we didn't realise. . .

1233
01:48:35,334 --> 01:48:36,801
that we drifted away
from our people.

1234
01:48:38,003 --> 01:48:39,334
You were right, Narsimha.

1235
01:48:40,539 --> 01:48:41,665
Nothing can be achieved
in this manner.

1236
01:48:42,675 --> 01:48:44,905
Like this we can do nothing
in the next 50 to 100 years.

1237
01:48:47,747 --> 01:48:48,372
You are right. . .

1238
01:48:49,815 --> 01:48:50,975
Krishnaraj must die.

1239
01:48:53,719 --> 01:48:55,311
But not the way you think.

1240
01:48:57,823 --> 01:48:58,755
What do you think. . .

1241
01:49:00,326 --> 01:49:02,123
the police will keep
their promises to you?

1242
01:49:04,096 --> 01:49:05,688
They'll dump you after using.

1243
01:49:06,665 --> 01:49:08,132
Like they have done
with many others.

1244
01:49:09,001 --> 01:49:10,127
Give me a chance, Narsimha.

1245
01:49:11,737 --> 01:49:13,295
We will achieve everything. . .

1246
01:49:14,406 --> 01:49:15,498
that we were fighting for.

1247
01:49:16,642 --> 01:49:19,076
Thousands of Narsimhas like you
will get employment.

1248
01:49:20,179 --> 01:49:21,441
Your children will be educated.

1249
01:49:23,716 --> 01:49:25,411
I want to make a deal with you.

1250
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:28,918
Let me go today.

1251
01:49:29,889 --> 01:49:33,052
And I promise that you and
your children will be my responsibility.

1252
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:35,327
As long as you wish.

1253
01:49:39,431 --> 01:49:41,865
The police will find
my bodyguard's corpse, instead of mine.

1254
01:49:43,869 --> 01:49:45,860
Don't worry,
They won't be able to figure out.

1255
01:49:46,872 --> 01:49:48,464
I don't have any police record.

1256
01:49:49,775 --> 01:49:53,006
Krishnaraj will be dead
for the world, forever.

1257
01:50:07,860 --> 01:50:08,451
Narsimha. . .

1258
01:50:09,061 --> 01:50:09,618
get going. . .

1259
01:50:15,935 --> 01:50:19,735
'Krishnamachari sir, do tell us how will. . . '
- What happened?

1260
01:50:20,139 --> 01:50:20,969
Is all okay?

1261
01:50:21,307 --> 01:50:21,773
Yes.

1262
01:50:22,374 --> 01:50:26,242
You see, we're talking about
a corporate farmer model.

1263
01:50:27,913 --> 01:50:30,074
We'll buy all the produce from the farmer.

1264
01:50:32,051 --> 01:50:32,949
And we will process it. . .

1265
01:50:33,285 --> 01:50:35,446
in our plant and export food products.

1266
01:50:36,622 --> 01:50:39,113
This will benefit at least 10,000 farmers.

1267
01:50:40,259 --> 01:50:41,920
And then, in our companies. . .

1268
01:50:42,094 --> 01:50:43,425
next fiscal budget, we'll at least. . .

1269
01:50:46,232 --> 01:50:48,564
'Letting Krishnaraj go,
was not an easy decision. '

1270
01:50:50,236 --> 01:50:52,261
'But I am happy,
that an uneducated person like me. . . '

1271
01:50:53,505 --> 01:50:56,702
'could convince an educated person
like Krishnaraj, to change his thinking. '

1272
01:50:57,276 --> 01:51:00,541
'Guided him to another way
to achieve his aim. '
