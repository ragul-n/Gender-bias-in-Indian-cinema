1
00:00:05,487 --> 00:00:07,158
Open sesame.

2
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:51,315
Close down. Come on, let's leave.

3
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:48,999
Let's go.

4
00:02:11,927 --> 00:02:14,645
Aflatoon, hide Marjina
somewhere very quickly.

5
00:02:14,727 --> 00:02:15,920
I'll hide her.

6
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:24,635
Hide inside this box.

7
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,637
In this box?
- Yes, in this box.

8
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:31,081
Don't worry. This is my magic box.

9
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:33,316
It's of help during difficult times.

10
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:34,999
Come on, hide inside quickly.

11
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:36,997
But she will be breathless inside.

12
00:02:37,087 --> 00:02:38,314
She won't be.

13
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:40,840
Arrangement for both air
and light is made inside it.

14
00:02:55,647 --> 00:02:56,999
I'll kill you.

15
00:03:12,327 --> 00:03:14,282
My lord.
- Move.

16
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:22,395
Gohra. Gohra.

17
00:03:28,247 --> 00:03:29,918
You idiot.

18
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,518
Shut up.

19
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:05,635
Listen. Loot everything
and put the tent on fire.

20
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:06,841
Hurry up.

21
00:04:20,087 --> 00:04:21,838
Jeevan, there's a
skeleton inside it.

22
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:23,279
Leave it here. Let's go.

23
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:32,635
Run.

24
00:04:59,407 --> 00:05:00,555
Marjina.

25
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:02,557
Those vile people killed my parents.

26
00:05:02,647 --> 00:05:03,920
I'll kill them.

27
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:05,155
Marjina. Don't be foolish.

28
00:05:05,247 --> 00:05:07,919
Leave me.
- If you go, they will arrest you.

29
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,280
Let me go.

30
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:11,723
I'll definitely exact
revenge against him.

31
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,000
Let me go.

32
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,723
Let me go.

33
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:30,839
Alibaba, you always
provide alms to the poor.

34
00:05:30,927 --> 00:05:32,405
God will make you prosperous.

35
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:33,919
Stay healthy and happy.

36
00:05:34,007 --> 00:05:36,645
Not me, bless my brother.

37
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:39,445
I'm giving away alms to
celebrate his marriage.

38
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:43,318
Master, God willing,
you too, like Mir Kasim. .

39
00:05:43,407 --> 00:05:45,078
. .will marry a beautiful girl.

40
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:49,557
Of course. God willing junior
master should have four wives.

41
00:05:49,647 --> 00:05:52,240
There should be a line up of
daughters-in-law in the house.

42
00:05:52,327 --> 00:05:54,635
Gulbadan, not even a
single one is there yet.

43
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:57,194
But you are dreaming about four?

44
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:01,760
Go bring some more
money from aunt Razia.

45
00:06:01,847 --> 00:06:05,236
No. You better go yourself.
She will reprimand me.

46
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:07,560
I'll go myself.

47
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:14,963
Bless you.
- Bless you.

48
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:18,124
While Mir Kasim holds
every penny close to him. .

49
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,244
. .this boy gives away generously.

50
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:25,478
Aunt, I feel like giving more alms.

51
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:27,238
Please give me some more coins.

52
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,725
You can give alms afterwards.

53
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:30,159
The marriage ritual will start soon.

54
00:06:30,247 --> 00:06:32,601
Yes, first, see how
your sister-in-law looks.

55
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:34,995
Yes, I'd almost forgotten.
Let's go. - Let's go.

56
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:47,044
Not yet. First, the
groom will see her.

57
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:53,556
Bride, please remove your
veil and look in the plate.

58
00:07:02,887 --> 00:07:08,518
Wow. It seems a golden lotus
has blossomed in a silver plate.

59
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:10,961
Oh, God. Oh, God.

60
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:14,516
Groom, now, you look.

61
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:20,880
Don't be shy,
Brother. Look like this.

62
00:07:33,407 --> 00:07:36,557
Hey, why are you
bending and looking?

63
00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:39,440
First, let the groom
look at his bride.

64
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:41,640
Please look at her.

65
00:08:03,887 --> 00:08:05,444
Have you seen, Brother?

66
00:08:08,247 --> 00:08:10,760
Bride, have you too seen him?

67
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,085
Now, I'll look at my
sister-in-law as long as I like.

68
00:08:19,327 --> 00:08:23,205
Brother, my sister-in-law
is a fairy from heaven.

69
00:08:23,407 --> 00:08:24,680
Congratulations, Brother.

70
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:28,361
Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

71
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:54,400
Sister-in-law.

72
00:09:04,407 --> 00:09:05,725
What are you doing?

73
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:10,119
Nothing. I'm removing
the dagger from your drape.

74
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:15,959
The drape is lifeless. It will
not get hurt with the dagger.

75
00:09:17,047 --> 00:09:23,076
But she is getting hurt who is
injured with the arrow of your love.

76
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:26,881
First, remove that arrow, Ali.

77
00:09:29,047 --> 00:09:30,320
Sister-in-law.

78
00:09:37,487 --> 00:09:41,320
Not sister-in-law,
call me as your beloved.

79
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:47,362
With just one glance,
you've made me your slave.

80
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:55,114
Sister-in-law.

81
00:09:57,407 --> 00:09:59,840
Don't move away from me, Ali.

82
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:03,598
Look at the love
oozing out of my eyes.

83
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:08,394
It wants to kiss
your lips and touch you.

84
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:15,115
Ali, look at my enchanting hair.

85
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:21,798
It wants to cover you
fully with its beauty.

86
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,035
No.

87
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:26,038
No, no.

88
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:30,117
You are my mother. And no son. .

89
00:10:30,207 --> 00:10:33,004
Don't mock my feelings by
calling me your mother, Ali.

90
00:10:33,727 --> 00:10:35,478
I'm younger to you.

91
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:37,443
But you are elder to
me in relationship.

92
00:10:42,647 --> 00:10:45,399
Ali, don't be stubborn
and make a mistake. .

93
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:48,080
. .which you'll
regret for your lifetime.

94
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:52,236
Come and hug me.

95
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:00,562
Let go of me. Leave me.

96
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:01,999
What are you doing, Ali?

97
00:11:02,087 --> 00:11:03,724
At least think about your brother.

98
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,603
Leave me, let me go.

99
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:06,881
Leave me.

100
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:12,999
My lord.

101
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:17,881
My lord.
- What happened, dear?

102
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:19,997
Ask about it to this
to this vile person. .

103
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:24,603
. .who removed my drape when
he saw me alone in the garden.

104
00:11:26,007 --> 00:11:28,361
And then he tried to molest me.

105
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:33,325
You traitor. I raised
you with so much affection.

106
00:11:33,407 --> 00:11:35,840
But you've hurt me when
you became a young man?

107
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:38,196
Brother, sister-in-law is lying.

108
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:42,598
What did you say? I'm lying?

109
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:47,354
You are looking at everything,
yet you are being silent?

110
00:11:47,447 --> 00:11:53,555
Dear, don't start a fire
which will destroy this family.

111
00:11:54,527 --> 00:11:57,245
Don't spread a fire of hatred. .

112
00:11:57,327 --> 00:11:59,886
. .which will make a bother
go after his brother's blood.

113
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:01,877
He is not brother, he is my enemy.

114
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:05,322
He has tried to molest
my wife in front of me.

115
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:08,239
Sometimes you fall prey to
misunderstanding, Kasim.

116
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:11,321
I've complete faith in Ali.

117
00:12:12,407 --> 00:12:15,557
He stakes his own life
for the honour of others.

118
00:12:15,887 --> 00:12:18,241
How can he try to
dishonour his own family?

119
00:12:18,327 --> 00:12:20,362
You should not take sides unjustly.

120
00:12:20,527 --> 00:12:23,199
Ali, go away from here.

121
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:26,198
Otherwise I'll get
angry and ruin you.

122
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:29,998
You are repaying your
brother's affection in this manner?

123
00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:33,239
Is this the way you are
honouring your father's legacy?

124
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:36,034
In just two days your
wife has made such a magic. .

125
00:12:36,127 --> 00:12:39,163
. .that you are thinking of
your family members as outsiders?

126
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:43,757
Very good. This is
how you do justice?

127
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:46,235
Instead of punishing
your wayward brother. .

128
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:48,123
. .you are taunting me?

129
00:12:48,207 --> 00:12:51,881
I'm so unfortunate that
I'm married into this family.

130
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:53,838
Otherwise would
anybody have dared to. .

131
00:12:53,927 --> 00:12:55,837
. . malign my morality in this manner?

132
00:12:55,927 --> 00:13:00,795
No. Dear, your morality is pure
and spotless like a flower of rose.

133
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:04,203
Sister Razia has made a
mistake in understanding you.

134
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:07,639
I had understood her when
I saw her dissatisfied. .

135
00:13:07,727 --> 00:13:10,524
. .after watching your face
on the day of the marriage.

136
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:14,003
Oh. Now, this witch has
begun to hurl allegations at me?

137
00:13:14,087 --> 00:13:15,917
Mind your tongue, Sister-in-law.

138
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:18,442
I can tolerate insult to me. .

139
00:13:18,527 --> 00:13:20,721
. . but I can never tolerate
insult to my elder sister.

140
00:13:20,807 --> 00:13:25,118
Listen to me, now either these
people stay in this house or me.

141
00:13:25,207 --> 00:13:28,642
If you want to keep them here,
send me back to my parents now.

142
00:13:28,847 --> 00:13:31,076
Dear. Dear.

143
00:13:33,247 --> 00:13:36,556
Where are you going,
dear? We'll go ourselves.

144
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:39,674
Now, there's no place
in this house for us.

145
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:46,121
Lady, how can I stay in the
house which has no place for you?

146
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:49,606
I had taken shelter with
you during my childhood.

147
00:13:49,887 --> 00:13:52,320
Now, I'll go away from
you only after my death.

148
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,715
Okay, go and bring our belongings.

149
00:13:57,807 --> 00:14:00,878
Okay.
- Wait, Gulbadan. I'll also come.

150
00:14:01,047 --> 00:14:02,161
Yes.

151
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:08,125
I warn you not to
touch anything from here.

152
00:14:08,207 --> 00:14:10,561
Whatever that is here is mine.

153
00:14:10,647 --> 00:14:12,443
What do you say?
- Yes, okay.

154
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:16,844
Chief guard, remove all their
jewellery and precious clothing.

155
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:27,323
Move away. Don't forget your limit.

156
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:32,602
No, Ali. Throw away the sword.

157
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:36,241
Now, I detest even a
penny of this house.

158
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,834
Let's go, Ali.

159
00:15:42,687 --> 00:15:45,041
''I'm innocent, my
heart is innocent. ''

160
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:47,321
''My heart is innocent,
I'm innocent. ''

161
00:15:47,407 --> 00:15:49,636
''When the eyes meet. . ''

162
00:15:49,727 --> 00:15:51,956
''What's going to happen?''

163
00:15:52,047 --> 00:15:54,196
''What's going to happen?''

164
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,561
''I'm innocent, my
heart is innocent. ''

165
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:58,796
''My heart is innocent,
I'm innocent. ''

166
00:15:58,887 --> 00:16:01,116
''When the eyes meet. . ''

167
00:16:01,207 --> 00:16:03,481
''What's going to happen?''

168
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:05,955
''What's going to happen?''

169
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:33,403
''Alas, I meet a partner on my path. ''

170
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:38,083
''They say there is
heaven in loving arms. ''

171
00:16:38,327 --> 00:16:42,797
''Oh, God. Wow. Oh, God. ''

172
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:45,116
''The heart is very strange. ''

173
00:16:45,207 --> 00:16:48,323
''It doesn't know this
secret of the paradise. ''

174
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,124
''It doesn't know. ''

175
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:54,481
''I'm innocent, my
heart is innocent. ''

176
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:56,716
''My heart is innocent,
I'm innocent. ''

177
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,036
''When the eyes meet. . ''

178
00:16:59,127 --> 00:17:01,321
''What's going to happen?''

179
00:17:01,407 --> 00:17:03,795
''What's going to happen?''

180
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:33,403
''There are colourful tales
hidden under the eyelids. ''

181
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:37,878
''Alas somebody will
understand what my heart wants. ''

182
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:42,722
''Oh, God. Wow. Oh, God. ''

183
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:45,036
''The heart is very strange. ''

184
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:48,243
''It doesn't know what it wants. ''

185
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:50,123
''It doesn't know. ''

186
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:54,395
''I'm innocent, my
heart is innocent. ''

187
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:56,636
''My heart is innocent,
I'm innocent. ''

188
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:58,956
''When the eyes meet eyes. . ''

189
00:17:59,047 --> 00:18:01,241
''What's going to happen?''

190
00:18:01,327 --> 00:18:03,715
''What's going to happen?''

191
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,114
''Since I became a young woman. . ''

192
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:31,322
''The heart is flowing with love. ''

193
00:18:31,407 --> 00:18:35,684
''As if something
fantastic is going to happen. ''

194
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:40,363
''Oh, God. Wow. Oh, God. ''

195
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:42,721
''The heart is very strange. ''

196
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:45,878
''It doesn't know the
secret of its heartbeat. ''

197
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:47,638
''It doesn't know. ''

198
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:52,036
''I'm innocent, my
heart is innocent. ''

199
00:18:52,127 --> 00:18:54,321
''My heart is innocent,
I'm innocent. ''

200
00:18:54,407 --> 00:18:56,636
''When the eyes meet eyes. . ''

201
00:18:56,727 --> 00:18:58,876
''What's going to happen?''

202
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:01,116
''What's going to happen?''

203
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:03,401
''I'm innocent, my
heart is innocent. ''

204
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:05,636
''My heart is innocent,
I'm innocent. ''

205
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,876
''When the eyes meet eyes. . ''

206
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:10,196
''What's going to happen?''

207
00:19:10,287 --> 00:19:12,800
''What's going to happen?''

208
00:19:17,127 --> 00:19:20,038
Wow.
- Very good.

209
00:19:20,207 --> 00:19:23,198
Very good. It was great enjoyment.

210
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,038
I feel the intoxication of the wine.

211
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:28,596
Very good.
- Wow.

212
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:33,714
Please listen, just now you've heard
the lyrical song of Mynah (bird).

213
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:37,402
Now, listen to the
shrieks of this wild crow.

214
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:41,280
Thank you very much
for appreciating me.

215
00:19:41,607 --> 00:19:43,722
But empty praise won't be enough.

216
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,524
I've given you joy with my job.

217
00:19:45,607 --> 00:19:48,245
You give me joy with
your money. Please.

218
00:19:48,327 --> 00:19:49,725
Thank you very much.

219
00:19:49,807 --> 00:19:51,444
God bless you.

220
00:19:51,527 --> 00:19:53,642
May God make you the
father of 20 children.

221
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,284
May God make you prosperous.

222
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:58,119
Thank you very much.
It is really heartening.

223
00:19:58,207 --> 00:20:00,117
Please give me. Bless you.

224
00:20:00,807 --> 00:20:03,320
Please be kind, be appreciative.

225
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:05,722
Not in the gathering of beggars.

226
00:20:06,327 --> 00:20:08,203
You will be appreciated in
the palaces of the rich.

227
00:20:08,847 --> 00:20:12,395
If you wish, come to my
master Kasim's palace.

228
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:14,963
You'll enjoy great leisure there.

229
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:19,562
You are forgetting that I
do not dance for leisure.

230
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:21,956
I dance to feed myself.

231
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:24,721
Enjoy the money of
your master yourself.

232
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:26,604
We are happy doing our work.

233
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:31,842
Hey, beauty. You don't know
whose invitation you are refusing.

234
00:20:32,207 --> 00:20:33,958
Just one gesture from me. .

235
00:20:34,047 --> 00:20:36,241
. .can make you rub
your nose on the ground.

236
00:20:36,327 --> 00:20:39,636
My foot! I am not afraid of anybody.

237
00:20:39,727 --> 00:20:42,798
Perfectly right. She
doesn't even fear me.

238
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:46,435
In spite of the fact
that my name is Aflatoon.

239
00:20:46,887 --> 00:20:48,035
Soldiers.

240
00:20:49,407 --> 00:20:50,964
Aflatoon.

241
00:20:51,047 --> 00:20:54,561
Arrest this arrogant woman and
take her to the Mir Kasim's palace.

242
00:20:56,767 --> 00:20:59,519
Please don't. .
- Where are you taking us?

243
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,399
Run.

244
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:10,045
Let's run.

245
00:21:13,487 --> 00:21:16,239
Aflatoon. Aflatoon.

246
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,204
Run from there.

247
00:22:14,087 --> 00:22:15,405
Run.

248
00:22:38,327 --> 00:22:40,282
You've done wonders, Uncle Mustafa.

249
00:22:40,487 --> 00:22:42,761
I feel like kissing your hand.

250
00:22:44,527 --> 00:22:45,720
Only hand?

251
00:22:45,927 --> 00:22:49,521
Because you've sewn
this clothing so well. .

252
00:22:49,807 --> 00:22:52,320
. .that my madam will not
have any doubt at all. .

253
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:54,203
. .that this clothing had
gotten torn at my hands.

254
00:22:54,287 --> 00:22:56,117
This is just clothing.

255
00:22:56,207 --> 00:22:59,323
If you mistakenly
cur somebody's throat. .

256
00:22:59,607 --> 00:23:02,040
. .I can sew him so well that. .

257
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:04,845
. .even the great surgeons
will not find out anything.

258
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:08,157
All right. Tell me how
much do I've to pay?

259
00:23:08,247 --> 00:23:11,556
Payment? Why do you embarrass me?

260
00:23:11,887 --> 00:23:14,605
I received my
payment when you liked it.

261
00:23:15,047 --> 00:23:18,561
Uncle Mustafa, you are so nice.

262
00:23:20,687 --> 00:23:22,404
All right. Now, let
me take your leave.

263
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:24,638
When will you return?

264
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:26,478
When the cloth gets torn.

265
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:30,645
The cloth can get torn everyday.

266
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:33,559
You tear it, I'll sew it.

267
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:35,398
You tear it, I'll sew it.

268
00:23:35,487 --> 00:23:37,204
Uncle Mustafa.

269
00:23:40,287 --> 00:23:42,402
Oh, God.

270
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:47,395
Thief. Thief. Thief.
- Thief. Thief.

271
00:23:47,607 --> 00:23:51,485
Thief. Thief. Thief.
- Thief.

272
00:23:52,327 --> 00:23:55,477
There he is, sir.
- Lets run.

273
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:56,715
Come on.

274
00:23:57,247 --> 00:23:58,474
Thief.

275
00:24:15,047 --> 00:24:17,401
Guards, catch them.
They should not run away.

276
00:24:17,727 --> 00:24:18,954
Run.

277
00:24:22,807 --> 00:24:24,000
Come here.

278
00:24:31,487 --> 00:24:35,957
Ill-mannered girl. You have
tried to dishonour my master.

279
00:24:36,047 --> 00:24:38,162
Now, you'll face the consequences.

280
00:24:48,847 --> 00:24:51,565
You are hitting a woman,
though you are a man.

281
00:24:51,647 --> 00:24:53,398
Don't you feel ashamed? Shameless.

282
00:24:53,487 --> 00:24:54,714
Marjina.

283
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:58,998
Friends, you are just
watching the drama here?

284
00:24:59,087 --> 00:25:02,317
Isn't there any brave man in
this city who can stop this man?

285
00:25:02,407 --> 00:25:05,921
Nobody is born as yet
who can stop Jaffer.

286
00:25:07,207 --> 00:25:08,400
Who is this arrogant man?

287
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:12,443
Have you forgotten so soon?

288
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:15,075
Who? Alibaba?

289
00:25:16,967 --> 00:25:18,684
Let these helpless people go.

290
00:25:20,607 --> 00:25:22,642
My master is Mir Kasim.

291
00:25:22,807 --> 00:25:25,115
Nobody else can order me.

292
00:25:25,207 --> 00:25:27,766
There is a bigger master
present than Mir Kasim.

293
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:32,044
He is God. He doesn't allow
atrocities against innocent people.

294
00:25:32,327 --> 00:25:33,600
Don't talk rubbish. .

295
00:25:37,847 --> 00:25:39,484
Guards.

296
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:09,200
Hey. What are you doing?

297
00:26:09,287 --> 00:26:11,880
Shut up.
- Shut up.

298
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:13,879
Shut up.
- Shut up.

299
00:26:15,327 --> 00:26:16,805
Hit them.

300
00:26:27,487 --> 00:26:29,124
Oh, my God.

301
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:45,880
He's coming.

302
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:53,634
What are you doing?

303
00:27:19,607 --> 00:27:21,836
Get up.

304
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:41,004
Cowards have run away.

305
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:43,646
Take this. Give it to
them when they return.

306
00:27:45,287 --> 00:27:48,358
Great. I've seen many warriors.

307
00:27:48,447 --> 00:27:51,722
But I had not seen such a
dynamic swordsman before.

308
00:27:51,807 --> 00:27:53,762
You have shown such a great skill.

309
00:27:53,847 --> 00:27:56,201
I'll never forget your favour.

310
00:27:56,807 --> 00:27:58,683
If you had not arrived. .

311
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:02,315
. .these vile people would have
taken me to Mir Kasim's palace.

312
00:28:11,087 --> 00:28:14,396
Not a human being, you're an angel.

313
00:28:15,207 --> 00:28:20,155
Thank you. I don't like
to listen to flattery.

314
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:23,043
Especially of women.

315
00:28:23,127 --> 00:28:25,594
Why? What is bad about women?

316
00:28:25,687 --> 00:28:28,837
God save me from the
treachery of women.

317
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:31,759
I have no faith in any
beautiful girl in the world.

318
00:28:40,327 --> 00:28:42,203
He has no faith in any woman.

319
00:28:42,407 --> 00:28:44,966
Arrogant man. Who was this madman?

320
00:28:45,047 --> 00:28:46,718
He looks like a crazy man.

321
00:28:47,287 --> 00:28:49,595
Mister, do you know him?

322
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:51,119
Who doesn't know about him?

323
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:53,515
He is Mir Kasim's immoral brother.

324
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:58,521
Immoral? - Yes, that's why Mir
Kasim threw him out of his house.

325
00:28:58,967 --> 00:29:00,194
So strange.

326
00:29:00,287 --> 00:29:03,164
I think this whole city is strange.

327
00:29:03,247 --> 00:29:06,875
Madhouse. Marjina, we better
go away from here. Come on.

328
00:29:09,527 --> 00:29:10,754
Marjina.

329
00:29:12,447 --> 00:29:15,040
The trouble is once again
approaching us. Let's run.

330
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:23,520
Marjina, he is the same Alibaba.

331
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:31,674
Let's plead to him.
He'll give us shelter.

332
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:33,199
No. No.

333
00:29:33,927 --> 00:29:37,362
I don't like to take shelter
from such an arrogant man.

334
00:29:38,967 --> 00:29:40,365
Ali.

335
00:29:42,207 --> 00:29:43,605
Look.

336
00:29:50,727 --> 00:29:53,923
He said he doesn't
have faith in any woman.

337
00:29:54,447 --> 00:29:56,198
I hate him.

338
00:29:56,767 --> 00:29:59,360
Alas, a girl hates
me in this manner.

339
00:29:59,447 --> 00:30:01,437
What do you mean?
- I mean. .

340
00:30:01,527 --> 00:30:02,959
Come with me.

341
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:06,399
I mean the soldiers. . Come on, run.

342
00:30:09,087 --> 00:30:10,883
Run.

343
00:30:11,327 --> 00:30:13,123
Leave my hand. Leave me.

344
00:30:13,207 --> 00:30:14,719
Please open the door.

345
00:30:14,807 --> 00:30:17,115
Marjina, you'll die
and get me killed too.

346
00:30:17,447 --> 00:30:18,640
Look there. .

347
00:30:18,887 --> 00:30:21,320
No, I won't come.
- Alibaba.

348
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,638
Alibaba.
- Let me go.

349
00:30:24,727 --> 00:30:26,478
Marjina, the soldiers
are coming from there.

350
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:27,794
Please open the door.

351
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:30,521
Come inside.
- Let me go.

352
00:30:31,967 --> 00:30:34,082
How come you've come here?

353
00:30:34,847 --> 00:30:37,406
Kasim's soldiers are
following us once again.

354
00:30:37,487 --> 00:30:38,839
Come with me.

355
00:30:44,807 --> 00:30:47,320
Welcome. Welcome.

356
00:30:47,407 --> 00:30:48,839
Welcome.

357
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:56,284
Oh, God. Ghost! Ghost!

358
00:32:07,847 --> 00:32:10,280
Brother, please stop.

359
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:18,038
They have run away. All of
them have run away. Cowards.

360
00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:20,321
I have crushed all of them.

361
00:32:20,407 --> 00:32:23,557
I chased all of them away. Luckily,
I was with him.

362
00:32:23,647 --> 00:32:25,682
Aflatoon, let's go from here.

363
00:32:26,247 --> 00:32:27,884
But please listen. .

364
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:31,038
Stop. What's the hurry?

365
00:32:31,127 --> 00:32:35,756
He looks very innocent.
Just like me.

366
00:32:35,927 --> 00:32:38,759
I think we should stay
as guests for a few days.

367
00:32:38,847 --> 00:32:40,404
What do you think?
- No.

368
00:32:40,887 --> 00:32:44,196
I won't stay here even
for a moment. - Why?

369
00:32:44,647 --> 00:32:47,285
A woman cannot have
faith in the man. .

370
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:49,880
. .who doesn't have faith in women.

371
00:32:50,087 --> 00:32:53,044
Let's go. - Of course you
may go. Who is stopping you?

372
00:32:53,127 --> 00:32:54,684
If you want, I'll
open the door for you.

373
00:32:54,767 --> 00:32:56,358
Please don't get upset.
Please listen.

374
00:32:56,447 --> 00:32:57,879
I say, move away.

375
00:32:57,967 --> 00:33:00,480
You may go if you want to go.

376
00:33:00,567 --> 00:33:02,761
Alibaba. What's the matter?

377
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:04,199
Nothing, Sister.

378
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:07,994
Sister?

379
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,885
Who are they?

380
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:18,035
I don't know. I saved them
from our brother's soldiers.

381
00:33:18,127 --> 00:33:20,003
But she is being so arrogant.

382
00:33:20,087 --> 00:33:22,077
She says she doesn't
have faith in men.

383
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,636
I said she can certainly go.
I'll open the door.

384
00:33:25,727 --> 00:33:27,125
You are ill-mannered.

385
00:33:27,207 --> 00:33:30,084
Does anybody behave in
this manner with guests?

386
00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:35,799
Sister, what's the hurry?

387
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:38,236
It would not be proper
for you to go out now.

388
00:33:38,327 --> 00:33:40,601
Perhaps, they will
harass you once again.

389
00:33:41,327 --> 00:33:43,556
Gulbadan. Oh, Gulbadan.

390
00:33:43,727 --> 00:33:46,081
I'm coming. I'm coming.

391
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:50,595
Why are you walking so briskly?

392
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:54,556
Please be cautious while walking.

393
00:34:02,487 --> 00:34:03,805
Who are you, mister?

394
00:34:03,887 --> 00:34:06,081
Gulbadan.
- Yes.

395
00:34:07,007 --> 00:34:08,485
They are our guests.

396
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:10,643
Please prepare
snacks for them quickly.

397
00:34:10,726 --> 00:34:12,317
Yes.
- Miss, please listen.

398
00:34:12,407 --> 00:34:14,078
Why do you trouble her?

399
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:17,124
I can prepare nice snacks.
Where is the kitchen?

400
00:34:17,567 --> 00:34:20,205
Oh, God. Will you work in
kitchen even though you are a man?

401
00:34:20,286 --> 00:34:22,401
You are talking about kitchen?

402
00:34:22,487 --> 00:34:24,841
I've prepared dishes
in Basra for years.

403
00:34:24,927 --> 00:34:26,405
You must have done it.

404
00:34:26,487 --> 00:34:28,556
Your face says it all.

405
00:34:28,887 --> 00:34:32,003
Madam, he seems to
be a useful guest.

406
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:33,519
Should I make him
work in the kitchen?

407
00:34:33,607 --> 00:34:36,200
Shut up. Does anybody ask
a guest to work in kitchen?

408
00:34:36,567 --> 00:34:38,636
All right. Bring
grocery from the market.

409
00:34:38,726 --> 00:34:41,080
I'll prepare it myself.
- Okay.

410
00:34:41,607 --> 00:34:43,244
Please stop. Stop.

411
00:34:43,327 --> 00:34:45,362
I too will go to market with you.

412
00:34:45,687 --> 00:34:48,325
You buy the grocery.
I'll carry it here.

413
00:34:48,407 --> 00:34:50,476
Aflatoon, what's wrong with you?

414
00:34:52,286 --> 00:34:53,400
Has anything gone wrong with me?

415
00:34:53,487 --> 00:34:55,317
Yes, you've gone mad.

416
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:59,639
You don't understand.
I want to do some work.

417
00:34:59,927 --> 00:35:02,076
If you want to work
and get food, take this.

418
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:05,797
Come with me. I'm going
to the jungle to cut wood.

419
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:07,394
Take it.

420
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:09,637
Let's go.
- I'm in trouble.

421
00:35:14,927 --> 00:35:17,235
Hey. Why are you coming here?

422
00:35:17,327 --> 00:35:20,318
Your path is from that side.
Mine is this side.

423
00:35:20,407 --> 00:35:21,634
Do you understand?

424
00:35:44,247 --> 00:35:46,999
I'll die. Alibaba, my back. .

425
00:35:47,927 --> 00:35:49,484
My back. .

426
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:51,443
You are a strange person.
What have you done?

427
00:35:51,927 --> 00:35:55,202
How would I know how to cut
the wood? I'm not a woodcutter.

428
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:57,163
Do you think I am?
- When did I say so?

429
00:35:57,247 --> 00:35:58,645
Alibaba donkey. .

430
00:35:59,007 --> 00:36:02,043
I mean that donkey.
It is running away.

431
00:36:03,647 --> 00:36:06,240
All right. Take those
chopped wood pieces home. Okay?

432
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:07,679
I'll catch it.

433
00:36:11,327 --> 00:36:14,523
He is saying I should carry
the chopped donkeys on the wood.

434
00:36:14,687 --> 00:36:16,278
As if I'm his servant.

435
00:36:17,287 --> 00:36:20,801
Stop. Hey, stop. Oh. Oh. You donkey.

436
00:36:26,607 --> 00:36:29,723
Finally I've caught you. You donkey.

437
00:36:30,847 --> 00:36:33,918
You are fated to carry loads, kid.

438
00:36:34,287 --> 00:36:36,959
Run away as much as you can,
the fate will not let you go.

439
00:36:37,047 --> 00:36:39,037
Open sesame.

440
00:37:02,327 --> 00:37:07,195
Partners. The caravan coming
from Baghdad has reached Nazla.

441
00:37:07,447 --> 00:37:10,040
We'll not get a better
chance to attack them than now.

442
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:12,321
Close sesame. Come on.

443
00:37:50,767 --> 00:37:53,883
Open sesame. Close sesame?

444
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,766
Oh, God. What secret is this?

445
00:38:06,687 --> 00:38:07,880
Come on.

446
00:38:19,087 --> 00:38:21,361
Open sesame.

447
00:38:39,287 --> 00:38:43,040
Close sesame.

448
00:41:14,527 --> 00:41:16,596
Oh, God.

449
00:41:18,087 --> 00:41:20,805
There is such a vast treasure here.

450
00:41:41,367 --> 00:41:44,756
Wow. My God. You are glorious.

451
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,515
You are great benefactor.

452
00:41:47,607 --> 00:41:49,961
You've given me so
much in this cave.

453
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:51,434
Wow.

454
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:05,563
Hey. Why are you sniffing it?

455
00:43:06,807 --> 00:43:10,435
Kid, you should not
get tempted too much.

456
00:43:10,727 --> 00:43:13,194
Eat only as much as you can digest.

457
00:43:13,287 --> 00:43:16,039
Otherwise, you'll lose
whatever you've got.

458
00:43:16,247 --> 00:43:19,044
Do you understand? Come on.

459
00:43:20,887 --> 00:43:23,116
Come on. Come on.

460
00:43:29,727 --> 00:43:31,045
Sister.

461
00:43:32,127 --> 00:43:33,605
Sister.

462
00:43:38,687 --> 00:43:41,678
Sister. . Oh, you are here?

463
00:43:41,927 --> 00:43:43,405
Where is sister?

464
00:43:43,767 --> 00:43:45,119
In the kitchen.

465
00:43:45,927 --> 00:43:47,075
Aflatoon.
- Yes.

466
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:48,838
Bring these bags inside.
- Right away.

467
00:43:50,967 --> 00:43:53,958
It is so heavy.

468
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:57,277
Alibaba, you are back?

469
00:43:57,767 --> 00:43:59,484
Why did you get so delayed today?

470
00:44:00,087 --> 00:44:03,123
Sister, I'll tell you later.

471
00:44:03,847 --> 00:44:05,643
First, give me something to eat.

472
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:07,318
I'm very hungry.

473
00:44:15,247 --> 00:44:19,637
Wow. Great. What tasty food !

474
00:44:20,527 --> 00:44:23,677
It seems I'm eating
food from paradise.

475
00:44:23,967 --> 00:44:25,160
No doubt about it.

476
00:44:25,247 --> 00:44:26,804
I wish to kiss the hand of the cook.

477
00:44:26,887 --> 00:44:31,118
No, not mine, kiss Marjina's hand.

478
00:44:32,047 --> 00:44:33,718
She has cooked.

479
00:44:48,527 --> 00:44:50,118
Why are you just sitting here?

480
00:44:50,207 --> 00:44:52,162
Open it quickly.
- I'm opening it.

481
00:44:52,247 --> 00:44:53,884
He is giving me orders.

482
00:44:53,967 --> 00:44:56,275
What dirt has he
brought in these sacks?

483
00:44:56,367 --> 00:44:57,685
Look at this.

484
00:45:10,887 --> 00:45:15,562
Gold coins, jewellery. .
Where have you brought this from?

485
00:45:17,207 --> 00:45:20,437
It seems master has
carried out a robbery.

486
00:45:21,407 --> 00:45:22,919
Tell me the truth, Ali.

487
00:45:23,047 --> 00:45:25,196
Where did you get
all this wealth from?

488
00:45:25,567 --> 00:45:28,524
Has poverty made you so dishonest?

489
00:45:31,887 --> 00:45:36,357
Sister, Ali can
never become dishonest. .

490
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,475
. .as long as I'm under your shelter.

491
00:45:40,887 --> 00:45:42,683
All this is God's gift.

492
00:45:46,007 --> 00:45:50,124
If this is God's gift,
God should give you more.

493
00:45:51,527 --> 00:45:54,359
I think these guests are auspicious.

494
00:45:54,767 --> 00:45:57,997
As soon as they came in this house,
we have received wealth.

495
00:45:58,807 --> 00:46:01,479
I'm the philosopher's stone.

496
00:46:01,647 --> 00:46:04,114
Whatever I touch turns into gold.

497
00:46:04,207 --> 00:46:06,276
But you are a stone yourself.

498
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:07,765
You are a liar.

499
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:15,715
Gulbadan, don't
insult me on every matter.

500
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,922
I don't like it at all.
Do you understand?

501
00:46:18,007 --> 00:46:19,359
You talk like that.

502
00:46:19,447 --> 00:46:22,404
Can anybody be turned into
gold if one touches somebody?

503
00:46:22,927 --> 00:46:24,564
So, am I lying?

504
00:46:24,647 --> 00:46:26,204
What else if not a liar?

505
00:46:26,287 --> 00:46:27,799
You've touched me so many times.

506
00:46:27,887 --> 00:46:31,083
But let alone gold, I
haven't turned even into any metal.

507
00:46:32,607 --> 00:46:35,404
It's because I did not
make you so deliberately.

508
00:46:35,487 --> 00:46:39,798
If I had turned you into gold, how
could I have married a gold idol?

509
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:42,963
Don't be under such an illusion.

510
00:46:43,047 --> 00:46:48,200
If you want to marry me, acquire
wealth like my master Alibaba.

511
00:46:48,287 --> 00:46:49,958
Otherwise forget it.

512
00:46:50,047 --> 00:46:53,834
I'll not marry any pauper.
Do you understand?

513
00:46:53,927 --> 00:46:55,723
Pauper?
- Yes. - Is that so?

514
00:46:55,807 --> 00:46:58,525
Then I'll marry you only
after I acquire wealth.

515
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,801
I too have been thinking on
those lines since a few days.

516
00:47:07,207 --> 00:47:10,915
It's not proper to keep you
as guest here for too long.

517
00:47:11,127 --> 00:47:14,084
So. . let me take your leave.

518
00:47:14,407 --> 00:47:15,885
How can I let you go?

519
00:47:16,407 --> 00:47:18,522
I wish you should
become a lady in the house. .

520
00:47:18,607 --> 00:47:20,483
. . instead of a guest.

521
00:47:21,167 --> 00:47:23,760
And I should stay as your guest.

522
00:47:23,847 --> 00:47:28,078
What. . I don't understand.

523
00:47:31,247 --> 00:47:35,524
I mean, God has sent
Ali's bride in my house.

524
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,075
I'll not reject God's gift.

525
00:47:40,247 --> 00:47:42,157
Now, you can think of

What's the matter, Sister Marjina?

You're looking very happy today.

550
00:51:19,247 --> 00:51:23,159
If anyone gets the wealth of the
whole world won't he be happy?

551
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:26,716
So, has master given you
his entire wealth? - No.

552
00:51:27,047 --> 00:51:30,118
He's upset with me, isn't he?
- Not only you.

Except for sister Razia he's upset
with all the women in the world.

554
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:36,645
Okay, Gulbadan. If
sister Razia tells him. .

upset with one woman. .

Sister was saying that. .

Why don't we renovate it?
- Well done, Sister.

You just changed the whole topic.
- Shut up, you liar.

talking about this house.

house will be renovated soon.

Servants, maids. . - So, will
you fire me and hire a new maid?

00:52:36,727 --> 00:52:39,365
Not at all. There'll be a
lot of maids in this house.

Look, if I didn't get wealth,
Gulbadan won't marry me.

Is it inside this wall?
Well, my work's done.

Who does this third hand belong to?

Who has held my hand?

614
00:55:35,367 --> 00:55:37,926
Got it. Destiny has held it.

615
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:43,120
Wow, such a delicate and soft hand.

Oh, my God. My hand. You've
twisted my hand, you fool.

Whose hand is it?
- It's the thief's hand.

Okay, keep holding it. I'll
catch the thief right away.

628

I've caught the thief.
- Oh, Mr. Muscle Man.

633
00:56:28,647 --> 00:56:31,114
Swear to your beard.
I'm not a thief.

634
00:56:31,207 --> 00:56:33,162
It's all that
foolish donkey's fault. .

635
00:56:33,247 --> 00:56:35,077
. .who fooled me and brought me here.

636
00:56:36,047 --> 00:56:38,924
You're the one who's fooling us,
you idiot. Give it to me.

637
00:56:39,007 --> 00:56:42,601
Does it belong to your father?
- Forgive me, Mother.

638
00:56:42,687 --> 00:56:45,200
You call a young girl
like me ''Mother?'' - Sister.

639
00:56:45,287 --> 00:56:49,996
Do you think I'll become
your sister? Curses on you.

640
00:56:50,207 --> 00:56:51,605
I'll colour your face black,
make you sit on a donkey. .

641
00:56:51,687 --> 00:56:54,041
. .and make you ride on it
throughout the whole city.

642
00:56:54,367 --> 00:56:57,324
Break his bones. Crush
his each and every bone.

643
00:56:57,407 --> 00:56:59,442
What happened?
- What happened?

644
00:56:59,527 --> 00:57:03,439
He stole my diamond necklace.
Beat him up.

645
00:57:03,527 --> 00:57:08,725
Beat him.
- Beat him.

646
00:57:08,927 --> 00:57:10,154
Hit him hard.

647
00:57:10,247 --> 00:57:12,441
Now, for your final treatment. .
A flower garland.

648
00:57:12,527 --> 00:57:14,278
Thank you for your treatment.
- Thank you?

649
00:57:14,367 --> 00:57:16,243
I'll wear it myself.
- All right. Beat him.

650
00:57:16,327 --> 00:57:19,602
Beat him.
- Beat him.

651
00:57:27,007 --> 00:57:29,566
My treasure's
getting filled with coins.

652
00:57:29,727 --> 00:57:32,843
Now, I've become richest
of them all. - That's it.

653
00:57:33,447 --> 00:57:35,641
Just keep dreaming day and night.

654
00:57:40,087 --> 00:57:42,122
Have you heard any
news about the world?

655
00:57:42,367 --> 00:57:43,799
What kind of news, Darling?

656
00:57:46,407 --> 00:57:50,285
I've heard that Ali has
made such a huge house. .

657
00:57:50,647 --> 00:57:53,001
. .that the whole
city's talking about him.

658
00:57:53,647 --> 00:57:55,955
And there's no limit
to his wealth at all.

659
00:57:56,047 --> 00:57:58,321
But how can it be possible, Darling?

660
00:57:58,407 --> 00:58:00,044
God knows how it happened.

661
00:58:00,407 --> 00:58:04,081
I'm getting restless since
the time I've heard about it.

662
00:58:04,167 --> 00:58:06,077
But we threw him out of the house. .

663
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:09,158
. .without giving him a
single penny. - So what?

664
00:58:10,007 --> 00:58:14,238
The one who has been thrown
out can even be called back.

665
00:58:14,327 --> 00:58:17,284
Darling, is it you
who's saying that? - Why?

666
00:58:18,327 --> 00:58:22,001
What's the problem in it?
- He has attempted rape on you.

667
00:58:22,087 --> 00:58:24,281
He has tried to ruin your honour.

668
00:58:26,807 --> 00:58:29,878
Everyone does it in youth.

669
00:58:30,447 --> 00:58:32,118
Look at yourself.

670
00:58:32,847 --> 00:58:34,564
You're above 40.

671
00:58:35,087 --> 00:58:39,284
But you still start
drooling looking at other women.

672
00:58:40,967 --> 00:58:43,605
Isn't it?
- Yes.

673
00:58:45,207 --> 00:58:48,278
And I'm not telling you
to call him forever, am I?

674
00:58:50,087 --> 00:58:51,997
Then?
- Come here.

675
00:59:00,327 --> 00:59:01,554
Have a seat.

676
00:59:07,527 --> 00:59:10,245
Got it.
- Oh, swear to God, Darling.

677
00:59:10,327 --> 00:59:11,998
There's no match
for your shrewdness.

678
00:59:12,087 --> 00:59:14,236
I'll send Ali an
invitation today itself.

679
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:25,197
''The emotions of my
heart and the joy of love. . ''

680
00:59:25,287 --> 00:59:29,962
''. . is because of you. ''

681
00:59:30,287 --> 00:59:38,637
''My life is because of you.
I'm alive because of you. ''

682
01:00:14,687 --> 01:00:18,679
''If you're all right. . ''

683
01:00:20,487 --> 01:00:28,120
''If you're all right,
what else do I need?''

684
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:35,681
''If you're all right,
what else do I need?''

685
01:00:35,767 --> 01:00:43,161
''It's all your mercy.
It's all your mercy. ''

686
01:00:43,247 --> 01:00:47,000
''What's sorrow and
what's happiness?''

687
01:00:47,087 --> 01:00:54,481
''If you're all right,
what else do I need?''

688
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:58,161
''If you're all right. . ''

689
01:01:20,127 --> 01:01:27,714
''All complaints got cleared
after embracing each other. ''

690
01:01:27,807 --> 01:01:35,156
''All complaints got cleared
after embracing each other. ''

691
01:01:35,247 --> 01:01:38,921
''All complaints. . ''

692
01:01:39,007 --> 01:01:45,878
''All complaints got cleared
after embracing each other. ''

693
01:01:47,167 --> 01:01:51,079
''It's not a problem
if you've forgotten. ''

694
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:55,045
''But this is not our first meeting. ''

695
01:01:55,127 --> 01:01:59,165
''Hiding your face doesn't hide
the emotions in your heart. ''

696
01:01:59,247 --> 01:02:03,080
''Hiding your face doesn't hide
the emotions in your heart. ''

697
01:02:03,167 --> 01:02:07,284
''We know what the
matter is and isn't. ''

698
01:02:07,367 --> 01:02:14,556
''We know what the
matter is and isn't. ''

699
01:02:14,887 --> 01:02:22,474
''All complaints got cleared
after embracing each other. ''

700
01:02:22,567 --> 01:02:29,483
''All complaints got cleared
after embracing each other. ''

701
01:02:29,567 --> 01:02:37,325
''Now, quit being shy.
What's there to be shy about?''

702
01:02:37,407 --> 01:02:44,562
''Now, quit being shy.
What's there to be shy about?''

703
01:02:44,647 --> 01:02:51,484
''It's all your mercy.
It's all your mercy. ''

704
01:02:51,767 --> 01:02:55,441
''What's sorrow and
what's happiness?''

705
01:02:55,527 --> 01:03:02,716
''If you're all right,
what else do I need?''

706
01:03:02,807 --> 01:03:06,242
''If you're all right. . ''

707
01:03:27,727 --> 01:03:34,996
''He's in contact today. The
situations are favourable. ''

708
01:03:35,087 --> 01:03:41,844
''He's in contact today. The
situations are favourable. ''

709
01:03:43,087 --> 01:03:46,999
''He has showed his
mercy again today. ''

710
01:03:47,087 --> 01:03:50,840
''Life has started rejoicing
after looking at his smile. ''

711
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:52,837
''I've stared losing consciousness. ''

712
01:03:52,927 --> 01:03:54,837
''I've even started to feel sleepy. ''

713
01:03:54,927 --> 01:03:56,757
''Why should I be quiet?''

714
01:03:56,847 --> 01:03:58,916
''Why shouldn't I say
what's in my heart?''

715
01:03:59,207 --> 01:04:02,198
''Why should I be quiet?''

716
01:04:02,287 --> 01:04:06,279
''Why shouldn't I say
what's in my heart?''

717
01:04:06,567 --> 01:04:13,836
''He's in contact today. The
situations are favourable. ''

718
01:04:13,927 --> 01:04:21,037
''He's in contact today. The
situations are favourable. ''

719
01:04:21,127 --> 01:04:28,555
''Oh, my crazy heart. Where
does your happiness lie?''

720
01:04:28,647 --> 01:04:35,802
''Oh, my crazy heart. Where
does your happiness lie?''

721
01:04:35,887 --> 01:04:42,405
''It's all your mercy.
It's all your mercy. ''

722
01:04:42,647 --> 01:04:46,321
''What's sorrow and
what's happiness?''

723
01:04:46,407 --> 01:04:53,403
''If you're all right,
what else do I need?''

724
01:04:53,487 --> 01:04:57,001
''If you're all right. . ''

725
01:05:17,287 --> 01:05:21,325
Wonderful. What fun !
Did you like it, Ali?

726
01:05:22,607 --> 01:05:24,756
What was the need to
take this trouble, Brother?

727
01:05:25,487 --> 01:05:28,558
I got you, I got the
happiness of the whole world.

728
01:05:28,767 --> 01:05:32,600
Yes, I haven't even
met you properly yet.

729
01:05:33,007 --> 01:05:39,115
Ali, come with me. I need
to tell a lot of things.

730
01:05:39,367 --> 01:05:42,642
Hear a lot of things
from you. Come. Come here.

731
01:05:42,727 --> 01:05:45,479
I know you're very
upset with me, Ali.

732
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:49,241
I've been unjust to you by
throwing you out of the house.

733
01:05:49,647 --> 01:05:52,718
You haven't been unjust to me,
Brother. You've done a favour to me.

734
01:05:53,047 --> 01:05:54,843
If you wouldn't have
thrown me out of the house. .

735
01:05:54,927 --> 01:05:57,759
. . perhaps, I would never
have become self-dependent.

736
01:06:00,167 --> 01:06:04,125
Perhaps, you are, Brother. I'm
trapped in the cage of wealth.

737
01:06:04,367 --> 01:06:07,517
But no. Now I'll get
rid of this wealth.

738
01:06:08,607 --> 01:06:09,721
Look.

739
01:06:16,607 --> 01:06:19,882
Half of all the
wealth over here is yours.

740
01:06:19,967 --> 01:06:22,639
But you can take all of it if
you want. - Thank you, Brother.

741
01:06:23,207 --> 01:06:27,916
I don't need your wealth.
- I know you have a lot of wealth.

742
01:06:28,287 --> 01:06:30,481
But I don't want
Mir Kasim's brother. .

743
01:06:30,567 --> 01:06:33,558
. .to have illegitimate wealth.

744
01:06:33,727 --> 01:06:36,843
So, you distribute all
that wealth among the poor. .

745
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:39,201
. .and take this
legitimate wealth to your house.

746
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:41,556
You're misunderstanding, Brother.

747
01:06:41,767 --> 01:06:45,679
I don't have illegitimate wealth.
- Then. .

748
01:06:46,407 --> 01:06:49,716
Then how did so much
wealth come to you suddenly?

749
01:06:50,847 --> 01:06:55,362
I. .I can't tell you, Brother.

750
01:06:55,927 --> 01:06:58,679
You think I'm an outsider. That's
why, isn't it?

751
01:06:58,767 --> 01:06:59,835
What are you saying, Brother?

752
01:06:59,927 --> 01:07:02,315
I'm telling you exactly what
I've been through, Brother.

753
01:07:02,407 --> 01:07:04,158
The lion moved
forward from that side.

754
01:07:04,447 --> 01:07:05,674
I moved forward from this side.

755
01:07:05,767 --> 01:07:07,996
He jumped from that side.
I jumped from this side.

756
01:07:08,087 --> 01:07:11,601
He went above me
and I went below him.

757
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:15,720
You fool.

758
01:07:17,327 --> 01:07:19,840
Good for nothing.
- Forgive me, Sire.

759
01:07:20,127 --> 01:07:22,560
I just got excited and
thought that you're that lion.

760
01:07:22,647 --> 01:07:24,796
But you're a jackal.

761
01:07:25,047 --> 01:07:27,879
What?
- No, Sire. I made a mistake.

762
01:07:28,367 --> 01:07:30,755
You're getting me
absolutely wrong, Brother.

763
01:07:31,207 --> 01:07:33,959
I don't have anything
against you in my heart at all.

764
01:07:34,047 --> 01:07:35,798
It's all just for the
sake of saying, Ali.

765
01:07:35,967 --> 01:07:37,115
If you didn't have
anything against me. .

766
01:07:37,207 --> 01:07:39,322
. .why would you hide such
an ordinary thing from me?

767
01:07:39,807 --> 01:07:42,115
You definitely think
that I'm still your enemy.

768
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,764
I'm telling you the truth, Sister.

769
01:07:44,007 --> 01:07:45,962
Since the time
you've left this house. .

770
01:07:46,087 --> 01:07:48,964
. . happiness has gone
away from this house.

771
01:07:49,327 --> 01:07:54,400
Hey, where are you going?
- Nothing. I'm feeling thirsty.

772
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:58,445
So, why are you taking trouble?
Have a seat. Sit over here.

773
01:08:01,127 --> 01:08:03,435
I'll bring some
sorbet for all of you.

774
01:08:08,847 --> 01:08:12,202
I'm afraid. What if
Kasim talks sweetly to him. .

775
01:08:12,287 --> 01:08:14,402
. .and gets the secret of
the treasure from him?

776
01:08:14,567 --> 01:08:16,955
Even I sense something suspicious.

777
01:08:24,807 --> 01:08:27,798
You go first.
- I'm not thirsty at all.

778
01:08:27,886 --> 01:08:30,160
Oh, don't be stubborn.

779
01:08:30,687 --> 01:08:33,917
If you're getting so stubborn,
then all right. Listen.

780
01:08:34,367 --> 01:08:36,721
But for God's sake, don't
tell it to anyone, Brother.

781
01:08:36,807 --> 01:08:39,366
You're suspecting me again.
Am I your enemy?

782
01:08:39,687 --> 01:08:42,120
Say it in my ear if you're afraid.

783
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:53,155
Open sesame. Close sesame.
That's it. My work's done.

784
01:08:54,567 --> 01:08:56,204
A brother should be like you.

785
01:09:02,487 --> 01:09:03,839
Come with me.

786
01:09:04,767 --> 01:09:06,757
But. .
- Stop him.

787
01:09:08,487 --> 01:09:12,081
Careful. I'll get hurt. Be careful.

788
01:09:12,886 --> 01:09:14,113
Jaffer.

789
01:09:14,607 --> 01:09:17,564
Take my brother under
arrest with all due respect.

790
01:09:17,886 --> 01:09:19,443
Soldiers.

791
01:09:26,607 --> 01:09:29,564
Brother, I couldn't imagine
even in my wildest dreams. .

792
01:09:29,647 --> 01:09:33,321
. .that you'll betray me like this.
- Quiet. Take him away.

793
01:09:34,127 --> 01:09:35,354
Let's go.

794
01:09:46,527 --> 01:09:50,121
Oh, God. What am I seeing?

795
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:52,800
This traitor attacked
me while I was alone.

796
01:09:52,886 --> 01:09:56,720
It's good that Jaffer came
to save me, otherwise. . - No.

797
01:09:56,967 --> 01:10:00,003
Our Ali can never do this.
- Keep quiet.

798
01:10:02,127 --> 01:10:06,039
My adorable wife, my shrewd wife.

799
01:10:06,567 --> 01:10:09,126
Everything has happened
exactly the way you planned.

800
01:10:09,367 --> 01:10:11,277
What should I do know?

801
01:10:11,447 --> 01:10:15,280
It isn't wise to leave the
bait that has come to your hands.

802
01:10:15,607 --> 01:10:17,676
Got it?
- Got it.

803
01:10:21,007 --> 01:10:23,042
Take him away and
put him in the dungeon.

804
01:10:23,127 --> 01:10:26,402
And tomorrow, kill him first
thing in the morning. - No.

805
01:10:26,807 --> 01:10:29,923
You can't kill Ali while I'm alive.
- Get lost.

806
01:10:30,247 --> 01:10:33,044
Sister-in-law. Have mercy,
Sister-in-law.

807
01:10:33,127 --> 01:10:35,162
How will you face God?

808
01:10:35,607 --> 01:10:40,964
The one who has power
doesn't need to face anyone.

809
01:10:48,407 --> 01:10:51,204
Marjina, what are you
looking at standing over here?

810
01:10:51,287 --> 01:10:53,277
Sacrifice yourself for your Ali.

811
01:10:54,607 --> 01:10:58,918
I should sacrifice myself
on him? I'm even happier.

812
01:10:59,287 --> 01:11:01,004
What are you doing, Marjina?

813
01:11:02,207 --> 01:11:03,605
Madam.

814
01:11:10,287 --> 01:11:11,514
Marjina.

815
01:11:11,607 --> 01:11:14,996
You've ignited the flame of
hatred in Marjina's heart.

816
01:11:15,927 --> 01:11:21,558
And only your blood can
douse this flame off. - Marjina.

817
01:11:22,567 --> 01:11:24,522
What has he done with you?

818
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:27,402
The same thing he has done with you.

819
01:11:28,167 --> 01:11:30,805
Madam, even you are a woman.

820
01:11:31,447 --> 01:11:34,358
So, you can understand my pain.

821
01:11:36,527 --> 01:11:39,199
I thought he was a decent
person and took his shelter.

822
01:11:39,807 --> 01:11:44,641
But he made me a prop to be used.

823
01:11:45,287 --> 01:11:46,605
He told me.

824
01:11:46,807 --> 01:11:49,400
Do you know what he told me?
- What?

825
01:11:50,447 --> 01:11:54,041
''Marjina, you're an excellent cook. ''

826
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:58,041
''So, I want to make you
the kitchen in-charge. ''

827
01:11:59,407 --> 01:12:02,318
Marjina, what has happened to you?

828
01:12:02,567 --> 01:12:05,319
That's what is written
in my destiny, Sister.

829
01:12:05,927 --> 01:12:08,440
Sister-in-law did
what she wanted to do.

830
01:12:08,767 --> 01:12:11,155
Now, let her satisfy
her desires as well.

831
01:12:11,607 --> 01:12:13,358
So that it gets confirmed
that every beautiful woman. .

832
01:12:13,447 --> 01:12:15,357
. . in this world is a snake. .

833
01:12:15,447 --> 01:12:17,721
. . who bites you
whenever she gets a chance.

834
01:12:17,807 --> 01:12:20,525
You've already bitten me,
you poisonous snake.

835
01:12:21,007 --> 01:12:22,758
Instead of making me your wife. .

836
01:12:22,847 --> 01:12:25,235
. .you wanted to make
me kitchen in-charge.

837
01:12:25,487 --> 01:12:28,922
You wanted to see my
struggling desires dance.

838
01:12:30,447 --> 01:12:32,835
Sister, allow me to show him. .

839
01:12:33,407 --> 01:12:37,319
. .the killer dance of
my struggling desires.

840
01:12:38,647 --> 01:12:40,125
Take those knives.

841
01:12:41,367 --> 01:12:44,005
And douse the fire of your revenge.

842
01:12:44,407 --> 01:12:45,555
Wait.

843
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:51,121
What if there's a trick in it?
- I'm a woman.

844
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:55,964
And I can understand the
feelings of a wounded woman.

845
01:12:56,807 --> 01:12:59,639
Go. You're granted the permission.

846
01:16:14,367 --> 01:16:15,560
Betrayal.

847
01:16:19,367 --> 01:16:21,118
He shouldn't escape.

848
01:16:24,207 --> 01:16:25,480
Get him.

849
01:16:45,127 --> 01:16:46,639
Open sesame.

850
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:53,803
Close sesame.

851
01:17:01,527 --> 01:17:03,084
Open sesame.

852
01:17:05,847 --> 01:17:07,359
Open sesame.

853
01:17:07,887 --> 01:17:10,036
Close sesame. Open sesame.

854
01:17:10,127 --> 01:17:11,195
Please, open me.

855
01:17:11,287 --> 01:17:15,279
I mean, let me go.
- No. Keep holding him. Open sesame.

856
01:17:15,687 --> 01:17:19,361
Open Shame-Shame.
Close Game-Game. Open. .

857

Ali.

Run away. Hurry up.

859
01:19:00,407 --> 01:19:02,283
Aflatoon, get them on the horses.

860
01:19:02,367 --> 01:19:03,924
I'll be right back.
- Come on.

861
01:19:23,167 --> 01:19:24,724
Hurry up, madam.

862
01:20:11,927 --> 01:20:13,279
Aflatoon.

863
01:20:21,767 --> 01:20:25,520
Marjina's shrewdness
saved our lives today.

864
01:20:25,607 --> 01:20:28,484
That fraudster left
no stone unturned.

865
01:20:28,967 --> 01:20:30,365
You are right.

866
01:20:32,047 --> 01:20:35,197
Hey, where has Marjina gone?
- What?

867
01:20:37,087 --> 01:20:38,678
Look over there.

868
01:20:40,607 --> 01:20:42,836
Perhaps, she's upset with you.

869
01:20:52,127 --> 01:20:55,562
Marjina, are you upset?

870
01:20:55,927 --> 01:20:57,882
What's there to be upset about?

871
01:20:59,887 --> 01:21:01,956
I have been so rude to you. .

872
01:21:02,167 --> 01:21:05,761
That you should've been.
After whatever I said.

873
01:21:06,047 --> 01:21:09,322
Marjina, you've given
me a new life today.

874
01:21:09,727 --> 01:21:12,240
How should I thank you?

875
01:21:13,127 --> 01:21:15,082
Thank a woman?

876
01:21:17,807 --> 01:21:21,276
Yes.
- You hate women, don't you?

877
01:21:21,727 --> 01:21:24,115
I did. But not anymore.

878
01:21:24,487 --> 01:21:30,118
Why? - Because I've seen
woman in her true self today.

879
01:21:30,487 --> 01:21:35,002
Really? There's no limit to
my happiness today. - Why?

880
01:21:36,687 --> 01:21:39,359
If someone's God
shows mercy on him. .

881
01:21:39,807 --> 01:21:44,038
. .and accepts his devotion,
won't he be happy?

882
01:21:57,687 --> 01:21:59,244
Open sesame.

883
01:22:10,647 --> 01:22:14,002
Close sesame. Close sesame.

884
01:22:55,007 --> 01:22:58,043
The wheel. Yes. Now, I remember.

885
01:22:58,367 --> 01:23:02,644
Ali said that by spinning
the wheel toward the left. .

886
01:23:02,887 --> 01:23:04,160
. .the bridge gets raised.

887
01:23:04,247 --> 01:23:08,125
And the bridge goes down by
spinning it towards the right.

888
01:23:53,807 --> 01:23:57,003
The treasure. Haroon's treasure.

889
01:23:59,607 --> 01:24:03,360

Are these pearls or eggs?

893
01:24:19,407 --> 01:24:21,362
Those pearls are
even better than these.

894
01:24:26,727 --> 01:24:29,445
Yes. These are real.

895
01:24:29,927 --> 01:24:32,394

01:26:51,606 --> 01:26:53,436
What are you blabbering about?
- I'm not blabbering.

915
01:26:53,526 --> 01:26:56,995
I've learnt magic from Mir Kasim.

916
01:26:57,086 --> 01:26:58,484
Magic?
- Yes.

917
01:26:58,766 --> 01:27:01,074

And while reading this
magical spell he disappeared.

921
01:27:10,166 --> 01:27:11,598
Oh, my God.
- Why?

922
01:27:11,926 --> 01:27:13,483
If only I can reach on time. .

923
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:19,073
Where are you going?
- I'll tell you later, Sister.

924
01:27:19,166 --> 01:27:22,157
You all wait for me in the
old house of Kucha Munisha.

I'll get caught. I'll get caught.

01:29:36,886 --> 01:29:38,603
I'll get killed. I'll get killed.

I'll get killed. What to do?

950
01:30:17,286 --> 01:30:18,400
Where to go? Where to hide?

951
01:30:18,486 --> 01:30:21,795
Yes. This will be fine.
I'll hide in here.

952
01:30:26,326 --> 01:30:28,156
Open sesame.

953
01:30:38,246 --> 01:30:40,634
Close sesame.

954
01:31:40,966 --> 01:31:43,604
What's this? So much of ignorance?

955
01:31:43,806 --> 01:31:45,557
Why didn't you lift the draw
bridge up while going away?

956
01:31:45,646 --> 01:31:47,601
Master, I remember that. .

957
01:31:47,686 --> 01:31:49,676
. .I had lifted this draw
bridge up while going away.

958
01:31:49,766 --> 01:31:51,995
So, did it come down all by its own?

959
01:31:52,526 --> 01:31:53,674
Come on.

960
01:32:15,806 --> 01:32:17,079
What's this?

961
01:32:17,406 --> 01:32:20,317
You've thrown such a
precious thing over here?

962
01:32:22,246 --> 01:32:23,724
Pick it up.

963
01:32:25,166 --> 01:32:26,439
You good for nothings.

964
01:32:26,526 --> 01:32:30,484
You waste your hard
earned wealth like this?

965
01:32:30,646 --> 01:32:33,523
I don't understand, sire. It
has never happened before.

966
01:32:34,006 --> 01:32:36,155
It has never happened before?

967
01:33:27,526 --> 01:33:32,235
Who are you?
- I I'm Daulat-Bin-Haroon.

968
01:33:33,926 --> 01:33:35,404
Daulat-Bin-Haroon?

969
01:33:37,926 --> 01:33:41,042
Master, he's Mir Kasim.

970
01:33:41,126 --> 01:33:43,320
Yes, I forgot my name.

971
01:33:43,406 --> 01:33:45,521
I'm not in my senses, sire.

972
01:33:49,166 --> 01:33:51,042
Don't worry, Kasim.

973
01:33:51,526 --> 01:33:53,561
You'll be brought to
your senses right away.

974
01:33:53,646 --> 01:33:57,194
Don't do this for God's sake.
Take all this and leave me.

975
01:33:57,286 --> 01:33:58,559
Here you go.

976
01:33:58,646 --> 01:34:00,715
Take this. Take this as well.

977
01:34:01,446 --> 01:34:04,403
Take this as well. I
give all this to you.

978
01:34:04,486 --> 01:34:06,555
As if all this
belongs to your father.

979
01:34:06,646 --> 01:34:09,113
No, it's all yours.

980
01:34:09,206 --> 01:34:13,244
Forgive me, sire. I'll
give you half of my wealth.

981
01:34:16,806 --> 01:34:21,242
Sire Sire, I'll give
my entire wealth to you.

982
01:34:24,766 --> 01:34:27,677
Sire, I'll give you the
wealth of the whole world.

983
01:34:27,766 --> 01:34:29,642
I'll make you a king.

984
01:34:32,326 --> 01:34:34,885
No, not a king. Emperor.

985
01:34:34,966 --> 01:34:38,082
Your Highness. Your Majesty.

986
01:34:40,726 --> 01:34:43,319
Sire, I. . I. .

987
01:34:43,566 --> 01:34:47,638
I'll lift you from the ground
and take you to the sky. Yes.

988
01:34:52,006 --> 01:34:56,362
Sire. Don't kill me,
sire. Let me get out of here.

989
01:34:56,446 --> 01:35:01,678
Mir Kasim, do you know
who I hate the most?

990
01:35:01,766 --> 01:35:05,235
I know, sire. The one who
wants to steal your wealth.

991
01:35:05,326 --> 01:35:07,122
No.

992
01:35:07,406 --> 01:35:10,477
Then the one who doesn't serve you.

993
01:35:11,086 --> 01:35:12,643
No.

994
01:35:12,726 --> 01:35:16,240
I hate cowards the most.

995
01:35:16,326 --> 01:35:20,000
And you are a coward even
in the eyes of the cowards.

996
01:35:24,166 --> 01:35:25,678
Haider.

997
01:35:30,086 --> 01:35:31,438
No.

998
01:35:40,486 --> 01:35:42,362
No.

999
01:36:00,606 --> 01:36:05,042
No. No. No.

1000
01:36:37,926 --> 01:36:39,483
Close sesame.

1001
01:36:55,806 --> 01:36:58,319
Open sesame.

1002
01:37:23,646 --> 01:37:26,523
Close sesame.

1003
01:37:37,926 --> 01:37:40,439
If the thieves come to know that. .

1004
01:37:40,526 --> 01:37:42,481
. .I'm the one who
brought this dead body here. .

1005
01:37:42,926 --> 01:37:44,677
. .they won't spare me alive.

1006
01:37:44,766 --> 01:37:47,154
But how will they come to know?

1007
01:37:47,566 --> 01:37:51,240
When a headless body
will be buried tomorrow. .

1008
01:37:51,526 --> 01:37:53,516
. .everyone will come to know.

1009
01:37:55,006 --> 01:37:58,839
If the head gets
joined to the body somehow. .

1010
01:37:59,086 --> 01:38:01,599
. . it can hide the entire secret.

1011
01:38:02,646 --> 01:38:07,002
But how can a separated
head get joined to a body.

1012
01:38:08,046 --> 01:38:10,195
That's where the problem lies.

1013
01:38:14,326 --> 01:38:16,714
This problem can be solved.

1014
01:38:17,246 --> 01:38:20,203
How?
- Leave that to me.

1015
01:38:29,486 --> 01:38:34,161
Uncle Mustafa. Uncle Mustafa.
- Who's this?

1016
01:38:34,406 --> 01:38:36,555
Please, open the door.

1017
01:38:45,086 --> 01:38:46,234
Who are you?

1018
01:38:49,246 --> 01:38:51,713
Didn't you recognise me,
Uncle Mustafa?

1019
01:38:52,326 --> 01:38:54,793
I'm the younger sister of the maid. .

1020
01:38:55,046 --> 01:38:59,277
. .who comes to you to get
her torn clothes sewed. - Oh.

1021
01:38:59,886 --> 01:39:04,401
Basheeran? Wow. You
sound so much like her.

1022
01:39:04,846 --> 01:39:08,121
Tell me how I can help you.

1023
01:39:08,686 --> 01:39:13,440
Uncle Mustafa, I'm the one
who has come to help you.

1024
01:39:13,526 --> 01:39:16,562
Oh, my. I'm so lucky.

1025
01:39:16,966 --> 01:39:20,401
It's the mercy of God that
she has come to my house.

1026
01:39:20,766 --> 01:39:24,394
Sometimes I look at her and
sometimes I look at my house.

1027
01:39:25,126 --> 01:39:27,241
My elder sister says. .

1028
01:39:27,566 --> 01:39:29,795
. .that you can even
sew a chopped head.

1029
01:39:29,886 --> 01:39:34,322
Yes, cut someone's head
off and see what I can do.

1030
01:39:35,246 --> 01:39:37,281
So, I've cut the head off.

1031
01:39:38,446 --> 01:39:41,960
You You mean. . You mean. .

1032
01:39:42,526 --> 01:39:47,724
I mean, you'll have to
stitch that head to its body.

1033
01:39:49,126 --> 01:39:51,685
Body? Head?

1034
01:39:53,766 --> 01:39:55,676
Why are you joking?

1035
01:39:59,446 --> 01:40:01,037
Coins?

1036
01:40:03,526 --> 01:40:07,040
Not now. After the job gets done.

1037
01:40:09,686 --> 01:40:12,563
Well, I'm ready.

1038
01:40:12,846 --> 01:40:16,804
Uncle Mustafa, you're so sweet.

1039
01:40:17,166 --> 01:40:19,918
Please get your eyes covered.

1040
01:40:21,206 --> 01:40:25,721
Why?
- Oh, God. Please, get them covered.

1041
01:40:28,486 --> 01:40:29,600
Go ahead.

1042
01:40:31,246 --> 01:40:34,476
Where will you take me?
- Don't worry.

1043
01:40:34,646 --> 01:40:37,034
I won't take you to hell.

1044
01:40:37,646 --> 01:40:42,116
Oh, I'm even ready to
go over there with you.

1045
01:40:42,366 --> 01:40:43,639
Okay.

1046
01:40:44,686 --> 01:40:47,153
Let's go then.
- Let's go.

1047
01:40:55,686 --> 01:41:03,319
''God is the greatest. ''

1048
01:41:05,206 --> 01:41:12,555
''God is the greatest. ''

1049
01:41:18,166 --> 01:41:24,843
''Carry on fixing
things and destroying them. ''

1050
01:41:26,246 --> 01:41:31,877
''Carry on destroying
things and fixing them. ''

1051
01:41:31,966 --> 01:41:34,559
''We are like a lamp. ''

1052
01:41:34,646 --> 01:41:37,284
''You can light us and put
us off whenever you want. ''

1053
01:41:37,486 --> 01:41:39,999
''We are like a lamp. ''

1054
01:41:40,086 --> 01:41:42,963
''You can light us and put
us off as per your wish. ''

1055
01:42:01,686 --> 01:42:10,684
''Darkness and light are our
companions every step of the way. ''

1056
01:42:12,446 --> 01:42:17,758
''Darkness and light are our
companions every step of the way. ''

1057
01:42:17,846 --> 01:42:20,313
''The games you play. ''

1058
01:42:20,406 --> 01:42:23,158
''You make us fall and
you pick us up as well. ''

1059
01:42:23,246 --> 01:42:28,524
''Keep showing us acts that
have never been seen before. ''

1060
01:42:28,606 --> 01:42:31,244
''We are like a lamp. ''

1061
01:42:31,326 --> 01:42:34,044
''You can light us and put
us off whenever you want. ''

1062
01:42:34,126 --> 01:42:36,593
''We are like a lamp. ''

1063
01:42:36,686 --> 01:42:39,245
''You can light us and put
us off whenever you want. ''

1064
01:42:39,326 --> 01:42:41,885
''Keep fixing things
and destroying them. ''

1065
01:42:41,966 --> 01:42:45,844
''Keep destroying
things and fixing them. ''

1066
01:43:03,486 --> 01:43:08,240
''Death is looming large. ''

1067
01:43:08,966 --> 01:43:12,640
''But we want to live. ''

1068
01:43:14,326 --> 01:43:16,919
''Death is looming large. ''

1069
01:43:17,006 --> 01:43:19,519
''But we want to live. ''

1070
01:43:19,686 --> 01:43:24,918
''We got to heal the
wounds of our heart. ''

1071
01:43:25,006 --> 01:43:30,238
''Keep making us do things
that you want us to do. ''

1072
01:43:30,326 --> 01:43:32,793
''We are like a lamp. ''

1073
01:43:32,886 --> 01:43:35,683
''You can light us and put
us off whenever you want. ''

1074
01:43:35,766 --> 01:43:38,154
''We are like a lamp. ''

1075
01:43:38,246 --> 01:43:41,681
''You can light us and put
us off whenever you want. ''

1076
01:43:46,086 --> 01:43:49,873
Look. Now, no one can say that
the head was severed from his body.

1077
01:43:50,286 --> 01:43:53,118
Well done. Here's your reward.

1078
01:43:53,366 --> 01:43:55,083
Thank you.
- Thank you.

1079
01:43:56,686 --> 01:43:58,915
Uncle Mustafa.
- Yes.

1080
01:43:59,006 --> 01:44:01,473
Let me blindfold you.

1081
01:44:01,566 --> 01:44:02,884
Go ahead.

1082
01:44:03,286 --> 01:44:05,435
I'll come to your
house tomorrow night again.

1083
01:44:05,526 --> 01:44:08,801
Why? Do you intend to
sever someone else's head?

1084
01:44:08,886 --> 01:44:11,604
No. No. Only to meet you.

1085
01:44:11,686 --> 01:44:13,038
Do come. Do come.

1086
01:44:13,126 --> 01:44:14,922
Let's go.
- Let's go.

1087
01:44:41,766 --> 01:44:42,959
What happened?

1088
01:44:43,046 --> 01:44:44,683
My purse fell down.

1089
01:44:44,766 --> 01:44:47,359
Don't worry. I'll
find it right away.

1090
01:45:02,126 --> 01:45:03,478
Here you go.

1091
01:45:03,926 --> 01:45:05,074
Thank you. Thank you.

1092
01:45:05,166 --> 01:45:06,723
Let's go.
- Let's go.

1093
01:45:07,966 --> 01:45:16,964
''Admittedly, all this is a
game of the lines of fate. ''

1094
01:45:18,726 --> 01:45:23,958
''Admittedly, all this is a
game of the lines of fate. ''

1095
01:45:24,046 --> 01:45:29,324
''But you are the one
who decides one's fate. ''

1096
01:45:29,406 --> 01:45:34,604
''Keep making people's
destiny and ruining it. ''

1097
01:45:34,686 --> 01:45:37,040
''We are like a lamp. ''

1098
01:45:37,126 --> 01:45:39,923
''You can light us and put
us off whenever you want. ''

1099
01:45:40,006 --> 01:45:42,394
''We are like a lamp. ''

1100
01:45:42,486 --> 01:45:45,363
''You can light us and put
us off whenever you want. ''

1101
01:45:45,446 --> 01:45:47,675
''We are like a lamp. ''

1102
01:45:47,766 --> 01:45:50,563
''You can light us and put
us off whenever you want. ''

1103
01:45:50,646 --> 01:45:53,113
''We are like a lamp. ''

1104
01:45:53,206 --> 01:45:56,402
''You can light us and put
us off whenever you want. ''

1105
01:46:00,326 --> 01:46:02,680
I'm not sad that we
have lost the corpse.

1106
01:46:03,206 --> 01:46:05,765
But the thing is death
is hovering over us.

1107
01:46:05,846 --> 01:46:08,075
Master, we're doomed.

1108
01:46:08,286 --> 01:46:09,479
The gold coins and
Dinars ( monetary unit ). .

1109
01:46:09,566 --> 01:46:10,884
. .are missing from the big trunk.

1110
01:46:10,966 --> 01:46:12,762
Dinars are missing too.

1111
01:46:13,246 --> 01:46:16,157
I wonder how long has that
lousy man been robbing us.

1112
01:46:16,366 --> 01:46:21,234
If we don't kill him soon, all
our efforts will go down the drain.

1113
01:46:21,326 --> 01:46:24,920
But master, how will we
come to know as to who he is?

1114
01:46:25,326 --> 01:46:29,284
Mir Kasim is a very
famous man of this city.

1115
01:46:29,806 --> 01:46:33,115
His murder must have made
people wag their tongues.

1116
01:46:33,206 --> 01:46:37,039
Let's check. We might get
some clue about the thief.

1117
01:46:40,686 --> 01:46:43,404
Have a seat. Have a seat.

1118
01:46:48,446 --> 01:46:49,560
Oh.

1119
01:47:00,046 --> 01:47:02,434
Let the song and dance begin.

1120
01:47:33,926 --> 01:47:35,995
''Grace in simplicity. ''

1121
01:47:38,486 --> 01:47:40,396
''Grace in simplicity. ''

1122
01:47:40,486 --> 01:47:43,045
''And panache in attitude. ''

1123
01:47:43,126 --> 01:47:47,004
''Numerous questions in tired eyes. ''

1124
01:47:47,086 --> 01:47:50,760
''Is the magic of me
stepping into the 16th year. . ''

1125
01:47:50,846 --> 01:47:53,200
''God. ''

1126
01:47:53,566 --> 01:47:57,035
''Is the magic of me
stepping into the 16th year. . ''

1127
01:48:25,086 --> 01:48:29,317
''When I make my way
into a gathering. . ''

1128
01:48:29,606 --> 01:48:34,042
''. .I take people's breath away. ''

1129
01:48:35,126 --> 01:48:38,481
''When I make my way
into a gathering. . ''

1130
01:48:38,566 --> 01:48:42,444
''. .I take people's breath away. ''

1131
01:48:42,886 --> 01:48:50,280
''When I lock eyes with someone,
people lower their eyes. ''

1132
01:48:50,646 --> 01:48:52,761
''A delicate body. ''

1133
01:48:52,846 --> 01:48:54,961
''And a blooming bud. ''

1134
01:48:55,046 --> 01:48:58,833
''My charm is mesmerising. ''

1135
01:48:58,926 --> 01:49:02,884
''Is the magic of me
stepping into the 16th year. . ''

1136
01:49:02,966 --> 01:49:05,525
''God. ''

1137
01:49:05,726 --> 01:49:09,559
''Is the magic of me
stepping into the 16th year. . ''

1138
01:49:28,646 --> 01:49:37,519
''I'm what lovers wish
to get in their lives. ''

1139
01:49:38,606 --> 01:49:45,955
''I'm what lovers wish
to get in their lives. ''

1140
01:49:46,286 --> 01:49:53,521
''I'm the choppy waves.
And I'm the storm. ''

1141
01:49:53,846 --> 01:49:56,120
''And I'm the shore the
waves are looking for. ''

1142
01:49:56,206 --> 01:49:57,957
''I'm a fireball of ice. ''

1143
01:49:58,326 --> 01:50:00,441
''I hurt people's hearts. ''

1144
01:50:00,526 --> 01:50:02,038
''And I heal it as well. ''

1145
01:50:02,126 --> 01:50:05,913
''Is the charm of me
stepping into the 16th year. . ''

1146
01:50:06,166 --> 01:50:08,599
''God. ''

1147
01:50:08,886 --> 01:50:12,321
''Is the charm of me
stepping into the 16th year. . ''

1148
01:50:12,406 --> 01:50:14,635
Wow.
- Great. - Wow.

1149
01:50:14,726 --> 01:50:16,636
Wow.
- Great. - Wow.

1150
01:50:16,726 --> 01:50:18,522
Wow.
- Great. - Wow.

1151
01:50:23,926 --> 01:50:27,759
You the epitome of
charm and panache.

1152
01:50:28,526 --> 01:50:32,643
Your beauty is out of this world.

1153
01:50:33,126 --> 01:50:37,323
Uncle Mustafa, you were
a pauper until yesterday.

1154
01:50:37,566 --> 01:50:39,521
Where did you get so
much wealth today?

1155
01:50:39,606 --> 01:50:40,958
I might have got it from anywhere.

1156
01:50:41,286 --> 01:50:43,401
Let this remain a secret.

1157
01:50:47,966 --> 01:50:51,196
I wish I had got
this wealth in my youth.

1158
01:50:51,966 --> 01:50:55,640
I have witnessed the old
age that never goes away.

1159
01:50:56,086 --> 01:50:59,122
And youth that never
seems to come back once gone.

1160
01:50:59,326 --> 01:51:02,283
Brother, why are you ruining it?

1161
01:51:03,246 --> 01:51:07,716
If you have wealth, you'll
feel as if you're still young.

1162
01:51:08,006 --> 01:51:11,122
Great. What a great thought!

1163
01:51:14,326 --> 01:51:18,079
Pardon me. May I know your name?

1164
01:51:18,406 --> 01:51:19,918
Sure. Sure.

1165
01:51:20,406 --> 01:51:23,158
This ordinary man is
called uncle Mustafa.

1166
01:51:23,326 --> 01:51:24,394
What do you do?

1167
01:51:24,486 --> 01:51:25,964
What do I do?

1168
01:51:26,286 --> 01:51:32,440
I stitch love into
beautiful girls' corsets.

1169
01:51:32,526 --> 01:51:34,197
What do you mean? That
means you're a tailor.

1170
01:51:34,286 --> 01:51:38,915
Yes. In stitching torn clothes. .

1171
01:51:39,046 --> 01:51:41,354
. .I made stitches. .

1172
01:51:41,526 --> 01:51:44,164
. .that changed my
lousy fate for the better.

1173
01:51:44,246 --> 01:51:48,523
And now, I'm enjoying
life to the fullest.

1174
01:51:50,606 --> 01:51:52,197
But why are you asking me all this?

1175
01:51:52,846 --> 01:51:57,794
I need a skilled tailor who could
stitch things other than clothes.

1176
01:51:58,566 --> 01:52:00,556
What do you mean by other things?

1177
01:52:01,206 --> 01:52:05,164
I mean hands,
legs, nose, ears, neck.

1178
01:52:05,246 --> 01:52:06,598
Neck.

1179
01:52:07,006 --> 01:52:10,520
I'll take 500 gold coins for
sewing up a head to its body.

1180
01:52:10,606 --> 01:52:13,324
You'll get 5000. Never mind 500.

1181
01:52:13,406 --> 01:52:15,441
5000.
- Let's have a private chat.

1182
01:52:15,526 --> 01:52:18,642
Okay. Let's go.
- Come on.

1183
01:52:33,406 --> 01:52:36,795
So, you can stitch a
severed head to its body.

1184
01:52:36,886 --> 01:52:40,560
Yes. I had stitched a
severed head a few days ago.

1185
01:52:44,326 --> 01:52:48,034
''My beauty knocks the
wind out of people's sail. ''

1186
01:52:48,606 --> 01:52:52,883
''My style leaves people speechless. ''

1187
01:52:53,966 --> 01:52:57,116
''My beauty knocks the
wind out of people's sail. ''

1188
01:52:57,206 --> 01:53:01,403
My style leaves people speechless. ''

1189
01:53:01,486 --> 01:53:04,602
''I'm a double edged sword. ''

1190
01:53:04,686 --> 01:53:08,519
''Be wary of me. ''

1191
01:53:09,126 --> 01:53:10,638
A lady asked me to do so.

1192
01:53:10,726 --> 01:53:11,840
Who was that lady?

1193
01:53:11,926 --> 01:53:13,995
I don't know.

1194
01:53:14,086 --> 01:53:16,280
She blindfolded me
and took me with her.

1195
01:53:16,366 --> 01:53:18,401
And she left me with the blindfold. .

1196
01:53:18,486 --> 01:53:20,601
''Is the charm of me
stepping into the 16th year. . ''

1197
01:53:20,686 --> 01:53:22,835
''God. ''

1198
01:53:23,286 --> 01:53:27,164
''Is the magic of me
stepping into the 16th year. . ''

1199
01:53:28,406 --> 01:53:29,804
What else do you know?

1200
01:53:30,086 --> 01:53:34,556
I just know that the house
is situated in a tenement.

1201
01:53:34,646 --> 01:53:36,715
But you were blindfolded.

1202
01:53:36,806 --> 01:53:39,558
I had heard a beggar's voice there.

1203
01:53:40,046 --> 01:53:44,038
Who always prays at Kucha Munisha.

1204
01:53:44,566 --> 01:53:46,362
Kucha Munisha.

1205
01:53:47,366 --> 01:53:49,083
''Grace in simplicity. ''

1206
01:53:49,166 --> 01:53:51,520
''And panache in attitude. ''

1207
01:53:51,606 --> 01:53:55,314
''Numerous questions in dreamy eyes. ''

1208
01:53:55,406 --> 01:53:58,841
''Is the magic of me
stepping into the 16th year. . ''

1209
01:53:59,086 --> 01:54:01,553
''God. ''

1210
01:54:01,646 --> 01:54:05,035
''Is the magic of me
stepping into the 16th year. . ''

1211
01:54:05,126 --> 01:54:08,754
Wow.
- Great. - Superb. - Wow.

1212
01:54:28,406 --> 01:54:29,724
So, you have got him here.
Take him along with us.

1213
01:54:29,806 --> 01:54:32,194
Master, we have
found out the locality.

1214
01:54:32,286 --> 01:54:34,958
But how do we find
out which house it was?

1215
01:54:35,046 --> 01:54:37,684
Lord, that could also be found out.

1216
01:54:37,766 --> 01:54:38,993
How?

1217
01:54:39,446 --> 01:54:41,356
While getting out of the house. .

1218
01:54:41,526 --> 01:54:44,085
. .I had made a mark like this on. .

1219
01:54:44,406 --> 01:54:48,603
. .the door by tricking
the girl in disguise.

1220
01:54:51,606 --> 01:54:55,041
Zeeka, take this old
hat to our hideout.

1221
01:54:55,446 --> 01:54:58,562
We'll raid that house tonight.

1222
01:55:32,646 --> 01:55:34,078
There's the mark.

1223
01:55:37,806 --> 01:55:41,354
Lord. Lord, there is the
same mark on that door as well.

1224
01:55:50,526 --> 01:55:52,755
Lord, look over there.

1225
01:56:17,646 --> 01:56:22,275
Lord, is it that
Mustafa has tricked us?

1226
01:56:23,526 --> 01:56:25,914
He won't dare to do that.

1227
01:56:27,846 --> 01:56:31,884
I guess we are confronted
with a very smart enemy.

1228
01:56:32,846 --> 01:56:34,164
Come on.

1229
01:56:47,926 --> 01:56:50,519
Thank God the
calamity has been averted.

1230
01:56:56,606 --> 01:56:59,073
You are crying?

1231
01:57:02,406 --> 01:57:06,444
My parents flashed before my
eyes when I saw that dacoit.

1232
01:57:07,806 --> 01:57:11,320
That cruel man had
snatched them away from me.

1233
01:57:20,246 --> 01:57:21,917
Don't shed tears, Marjina.

1234
01:57:23,166 --> 01:57:25,998
I guess God wanted to bring
us together because of this.

1235
01:57:29,646 --> 01:57:32,557
Brother's days of
mourning will end tomorrow.

1236
01:57:32,766 --> 01:57:35,837
And we'll go and stay in
our royal palace again.

1237
01:57:36,486 --> 01:57:40,842
Where we'll get the
pleasures of a new life.

1238
01:57:41,206 --> 01:57:44,515
Droplets of love
will drip from the sky.

1239
01:57:45,086 --> 01:57:47,155
And we'll bathe in it.

1240
01:57:52,766 --> 01:57:55,279
It's such a beautiful dream.

1241
01:58:01,806 --> 01:58:04,239
Marjina, this is reality.

1242
01:58:05,166 --> 01:58:10,034
Wish you knew that I'm
madly in love with you.

1243
01:58:12,366 --> 01:58:15,675
Your thought is
always with me like. .

1244
01:58:15,966 --> 01:58:20,004
. .the brightness of the
sun and the light of a lamp.

1245
01:58:20,366 --> 01:58:25,075
I'm getting closer. .

1246
01:58:25,806 --> 01:58:28,603
. .and closer to you every moment.

1247
01:58:29,566 --> 01:58:34,593
I too dream of you all the time.

1248
01:59:04,006 --> 01:59:08,874
''Come into my arms. ''

1249
01:59:08,966 --> 01:59:13,402
''My heart longs for you. ''

1250
01:59:13,486 --> 01:59:17,273
''The poise in your eyes. Oh, God. ''

1251
01:59:18,126 --> 01:59:22,243
''And gleam in your eyes. Oh, God. ''

1252
01:59:22,726 --> 01:59:27,355
''Don't kindle desire within me. ''

1253
01:59:27,566 --> 01:59:31,638
''And don't create
a storm within me. ''

1254
01:59:31,806 --> 01:59:34,000
''You take my breath away. ''

1255
01:59:34,086 --> 01:59:35,962
''Oh, my God. ''

1256
01:59:36,326 --> 01:59:40,443
''Flirtatious talks. Oh, my God''

1257
02:00:08,846 --> 02:00:13,714
''These pearl like
dew drops on flowers. ''

1258
02:00:13,806 --> 02:00:18,959
''As if the stars have
descended on earth. ''

1259
02:00:23,006 --> 02:00:27,635
''These pearl like
dew drops on flowers. ''

1260
02:00:27,726 --> 02:00:32,321
''As if the stars have
descended on earth. ''

1261
02:00:32,406 --> 02:00:37,001
''Look at me, Sweetheart. ''

1262
02:00:37,086 --> 02:00:42,079
''My heart calls out to you. ''

1263
02:00:42,166 --> 02:00:46,795
''Come into my arms. ''

1264
02:00:46,886 --> 02:00:51,401
''My heart longs for you. ''

1265
02:00:51,486 --> 02:00:55,239
''The poise in your eyes. Oh, God. ''

1266
02:00:56,126 --> 02:01:00,277
''And gleam in your eyes. Oh, God. ''

1267
02:01:33,446 --> 02:01:38,235
''Is it the water gushing down?

1268
02:01:38,326 --> 02:01:43,319
''Or is it that you've
let your hair loose?''

1269
02:01:47,646 --> 02:01:52,355
''Is it the water gushing down?

1270
02:01:52,446 --> 02:01:56,996
''Or is it that you've
let your hair loose?''

1271
02:01:57,086 --> 02:02:01,681
''Don't come close to me
and look at me like this. ''

1272
02:02:01,766 --> 02:02:06,520
''I can feel the passion in you. ''

1273
02:02:06,726 --> 02:02:11,515
''Don't kindle desire within me. ''

1274
02:02:11,606 --> 02:02:15,917
''And don't create
a storm within me. ''

1275
02:02:16,006 --> 02:02:18,155
''You take my breath away. ''

1276
02:02:18,366 --> 02:02:19,764
''Oh, my God. ''

1277
02:02:20,566 --> 02:02:24,604
''Flirtatious talks. Oh, my God''

1278
02:02:55,166 --> 02:03:00,034
''Is it a boat or a
palanquin carrying the moon?''

1279
02:03:00,126 --> 02:03:05,404
''It's floating
away and flying away. ''

1280
02:03:09,366 --> 02:03:14,120
''Is it a boat or a
palanquin carrying the moon?''

1281
02:03:14,206 --> 02:03:18,676
''It's floating
away and flying away. ''

1282
02:03:18,766 --> 02:03:23,441
''Darling, these are the
miracles that love can bring about. ''

1283
02:03:23,526 --> 02:03:28,519
''Love is in all its glory. ''

1284
02:03:28,606 --> 02:03:33,395
''Come into my arms. ''

1285
02:03:33,486 --> 02:03:37,922
''My heart longs for you. ''

1286
02:03:38,006 --> 02:03:42,044
''The poise in your eyes. Oh, God. ''

''And don't create
a storm within me. ''

''You take my breath away. ''

1291
02:03:58,566 --> 02:03:59,884
''Oh, my God. ''

1292
02:04:00,766 --> 02:04:05,202
''Flirtatious talks. Oh, my God''

1293
02:04:18,646 --> 02:04:25,562
May Allah grant a long life to
our new master, Ali Bin Haroon.

1294
02:04:25,646 --> 02:04:27,124
Amen.
- Amen.

1295
02:04:27,206 --> 02:04:32,723
May Allah grant him
immense wealth and fame.

1296
02:04:32,966 --> 02:04:34,478
Amen.

1297
02:04:34,686 --> 02:04:38,564
Your Highness, accept the
first gift from your slave.

1298
02:04:39,526 --> 02:04:42,198
May Allah make you wealthy.

1299
02:04:53,246 --> 02:04:56,635
Now onwards, this wealth will
not be a part of my treasure.

1300
02:04:57,126 --> 02:05:01,403
I'll help the poor,
orphaned and widowed with it.

1301
02:05:01,886 --> 02:05:05,116
I'll spend it on the
oppressed and the needy.

1302
02:05:05,206 --> 02:05:08,117
May Allah keep our
master hale and hearty.

1303
02:05:08,206 --> 02:05:09,763
Amen.

1304
02:05:10,086 --> 02:05:11,154
Now, you guys can leave.

1305
02:05:11,246 --> 02:05:13,634
May God be with you.
- May God be with you?

1306
02:05:22,806 --> 02:05:23,874
Congratulations.

1307
02:05:23,966 --> 02:05:26,115
Congratulations, your highness.
- Congratulations.

1308
02:05:26,206 --> 02:05:28,275
May God be with you?

1309
02:05:28,526 --> 02:05:30,117
May God make you a good ruler. ''

1310
02:05:30,206 --> 02:05:31,843
Here. Have some sweets.

1311
02:05:31,926 --> 02:05:33,324
Congratulations, Your Highness.

1312
02:05:33,886 --> 02:05:36,479
Where is Marjina?

1313
02:05:36,646 --> 02:05:38,522
She was standing
here a little while ago.

1314
02:05:39,486 --> 02:05:41,999
Marjina, what are you doing there?

1315
02:05:42,086 --> 02:05:43,359
Come.

1316
02:05:47,606 --> 02:05:49,402
She won't come, Mother.

1317
02:05:49,766 --> 02:05:51,756
Today, I'll have to go to her.

1318
02:05:51,846 --> 02:05:53,915
Then go. Go.

1319
02:06:02,526 --> 02:06:04,561
Congratulations on being the master.

1320
02:06:07,686 --> 02:06:09,118
Marjina.

1321
02:06:12,166 --> 02:06:14,963
You have already
dedicated your life to me.

1322
02:06:15,126 --> 02:06:17,355
But I haven't given
you anything thus far.

1323
02:06:18,126 --> 02:06:20,480
Ask from me whatever you want.

1324
02:06:20,566 --> 02:06:24,114
You'll be given
whatever you ask for.

1325
02:06:24,686 --> 02:06:28,075
I don't want
anything else except you.

1326
02:06:28,606 --> 02:06:31,995
I have asked for
everything by asking for you.

1327
02:06:32,326 --> 02:06:35,203
I can't ask for anything more.

1328
02:06:35,286 --> 02:06:38,675
No, Marjina. Ask for
something else besides me.

1329
02:06:39,086 --> 02:06:41,758
I will, when I feel the need.

1330
02:06:42,526 --> 02:06:45,517
Okay. I'm indebted to you.

1331
02:06:45,846 --> 02:06:49,394
I'll fulfil your
biggest desire at least once.

1332
02:06:49,606 --> 02:06:50,879
Even if it costs me my life.

1333
02:06:50,966 --> 02:06:52,159
God forbid.

1334
02:07:03,006 --> 02:07:05,473
Oh, my God. What have you done?

1335
02:07:05,886 --> 02:07:08,922
I've my made my mark on my love.

1336
02:07:34,086 --> 02:07:35,484
No. no, Lord.

1337
02:07:36,606 --> 02:07:42,157
Have mercy on my old
age for God's sake.

1338
02:07:44,006 --> 02:07:45,961
Tell me where the
thief is. Where's thief!

1339
02:07:46,046 --> 02:07:49,162
Lord, you're the chief of thieves.

1340
02:07:49,246 --> 02:07:50,314
Better than you. .

1341
02:07:50,406 --> 02:07:52,157
What?
- No. No, Lord.

1342
02:07:52,246 --> 02:07:54,440
It was just a slip of tongue.

1343
02:07:54,526 --> 02:07:58,518
The real thief is the
one who stole your wealth.

1344
02:08:00,046 --> 02:08:03,640
Mustafa, I don't
care about the wealth.

1345
02:08:04,206 --> 02:08:09,040
I rue the fact that the idiot
might have become rich in a day.

1346
02:08:09,206 --> 02:08:11,639
He became rich in a day.

1347
02:08:13,046 --> 02:08:17,596
Lord. Lord. Then I know him.

1348
02:08:18,006 --> 02:08:19,279
Who is that man?

1349
02:08:19,646 --> 02:08:22,443
Alibaba became rich in a day.

1350
02:08:23,046 --> 02:08:25,354
And he is Kasim's brother as well.

1351
02:08:29,046 --> 02:08:30,842
Alibaba.

1352
02:08:32,646 --> 02:08:36,957
It can't be anyone
else other than him.

1353
02:08:37,286 --> 02:08:41,324
Lord, now at least spare me.

1354
02:08:41,406 --> 02:08:42,554
Zeeka.

1355
02:08:51,606 --> 02:08:54,278
Lord, I promise you
I won't tell anyone. .

1356
02:08:54,606 --> 02:08:57,802
. .about the
whereabouts of your treasure.

1357
02:08:58,126 --> 02:09:01,754
This secret will be buried
in my grave along with me.

1358
02:09:03,726 --> 02:09:06,956
Zeeka, grant him his wish.
Take him away.

1359
02:09:07,046 --> 02:09:08,956
May God pay you for this kindness.

1360
02:09:09,046 --> 02:09:11,400
You are not human, but an angel.

1361
02:09:18,006 --> 02:09:19,723
Everyone here is an angel.

1362
02:09:19,926 --> 02:09:24,077
Allah creates such kind and
noble people once in a while.

1363
02:09:24,166 --> 02:09:25,518
Stop.

1364
02:09:26,246 --> 02:09:27,963
Sir, why are you stopping me now?

1365
02:09:28,046 --> 02:09:30,001
Lord has set me free.

1366
02:09:30,086 --> 02:09:32,758
We got to set you
free from your life.

1367
02:09:43,086 --> 02:09:46,157
Move. Move. Move out of the way.

1368
02:09:46,246 --> 02:09:48,918
Attention. Attention.

1369
02:09:49,006 --> 02:09:50,677
The pride of the merchant community.

02:09:50,766 --> 02:09:53,837
The king of kings. A storm.
A whirlwind.

1371
02:09:53,926 --> 02:09:55,483
No introduction. And someone
who is unknown to everyone.

1372
02:09:55,566 --> 02:09:57,078
An uninvited guest.

1373
02:09:57,166 --> 02:10:02,319
The supreme ruler. The
mighty merchant is at your door.

1374
02:10:02,486 --> 02:10:04,794
Aflatoon, who is he?

1375
02:10:05,046 --> 02:10:06,956
Who is here with all this things?

1376
02:10:07,326 --> 02:10:08,678
Lord, he is a 'Teeli ( oil-seller). '

1377
02:10:08,766 --> 02:10:12,121
Teeli.
- Yes. He sells oil.

1378
02:10:12,206 --> 02:10:16,483
Lord, I mean he is a
great oil merchant.

1379
02:10:16,566 --> 02:10:18,681
He wants to be your guest.

1380
02:10:18,766 --> 02:10:21,802
My doors are always open for guests.

1381
02:10:22,766 --> 02:10:25,598
Come on. Come down, Lord.

1382
02:10:25,686 --> 02:10:28,677
Come on. Come along. Come.

1383
02:10:29,006 --> 02:10:30,723
Come along.

1384
02:10:37,566 --> 02:10:40,955
The ordinary slave salutes
the master of the rich people. .

. .Ali Bin Haroon.

1386
02:10:43,286 --> 02:10:45,321
Tell me. What brings you here?

1387
02:10:45,966 --> 02:10:50,595
I have to go the king of
Yemen with these oil barrels.

1388
02:10:51,166 --> 02:10:53,315
It contains very precious oil.

1389
02:10:53,646 --> 02:10:56,000
I have heard that the
road ahead is treacherous.

1390
02:10:56,206 --> 02:10:58,196
Dacoits loot you on the way.

1391
02:10:58,446 --> 02:11:01,164
That's why we want to stay
at your place for a night.

1392
02:11:01,366 --> 02:11:02,718
Yes. Why not?

1393
02:11:02,926 --> 02:11:04,597
I'm ready to serve
you every which way.

1394

Praise the Lord.

1395

You just wait and watch.

1396
02:11:07,526 --> 02:11:11,484
I'll repay you in kind
for your hospitality.

1397
02:11:11,886 --> 02:11:13,796
I don't help others
expecting things in return.

1398
02:11:14,366 --> 02:11:18,199
Aflatoon, get these big
barrels kept in the storeroom.

1399
02:11:18,366 --> 02:11:19,559
As you say, Lord.

1400
02:11:20,046 --> 02:11:21,763
Hey. Unload all the barrels.

1401
02:11:21,846 --> 02:11:23,119
Come on. Hurry up.

Let me give my
slaves some instructions.

1407
02:11:49,886 --> 02:11:52,763
So that I don't suffer any loss
because of their carelessness.

1408
02:11:52,966 --> 02:11:54,239
The oil is extremely precious.

1409
02:11:54,406 --> 02:11:55,474
Yes. Why not?

1410
02:11:55,566 --> 02:11:58,716
You go in. I'll join you in a jiffy.

1411
02:12:04,646 --> 02:12:06,078
Bring them. Come on, bring them.

1412
02:12:06,166 --> 02:12:07,280
So, are all the barrels here?

1413
02:12:07,366 --> 02:12:09,117
Okay. Keep them carefully.
Carefully.

1414
02:12:09,206 --> 02:12:10,604
Carefully.

1415
02:12:18,766 --> 02:12:20,596
Saigum.
- Yes, Lord.

1416
02:12:20,686 --> 02:12:24,200
Come out as soon as I clap thrice.

1417
02:12:24,366 --> 02:12:26,321
Otherwise, my life
will be in danger.

1418
02:12:26,646 --> 02:12:30,035
Got it? I'll clap thrice.

1419
02:12:33,846 --> 02:12:34,914
Here.

1420
02:12:35,246 --> 02:12:36,598
Here you go. Here.

1421
02:12:36,686 --> 02:12:37,754
Come on, leave.

1422
02:12:37,966 --> 02:12:39,193
I must see you going.
Come on. Come on.

1423
02:12:39,286 --> 02:12:40,559
Come on, go. Go. Go.

1424
02:12:41,806 --> 02:12:43,796
What are you looking at?

1425
02:12:43,966 --> 02:12:45,239
Go.

1426
02:12:55,286 --> 02:12:58,083
Wow. That was a great deal.

1427
02:12:58,166 --> 02:13:03,000
If I get some merchants
like him, I'll be rich.

1428
02:13:05,006 --> 02:13:06,233
Talk softly.

1429
02:13:06,326 --> 02:13:07,883
Why? Why? Why?

1430
02:13:10,846 --> 02:13:13,678
Aflatoon, I'm sure these
barrels don't contain. .

1431
02:13:13,766 --> 02:13:15,278
. .oil and clarified butter.

1432
02:13:17,086 --> 02:13:19,201
If there is no oil or
clarified butter in these barrels. .

1433
02:13:19,286 --> 02:13:20,843
. .then are there
devils or ghosts in it?

1434
02:13:20,926 --> 02:13:22,153
Yes.

1435
02:13:22,246 --> 02:13:25,078
I have heard a devil speak.

1436
02:13:25,166 --> 02:13:26,393
Really.

1437
02:13:26,486 --> 02:13:27,600
Come here.

1438
02:13:31,606 --> 02:13:32,754
Knock on them.

1439
02:13:32,846 --> 02:13:34,164
No ways.

1440
02:13:34,366 --> 02:13:36,515
What if the ghost comes out?

1441
02:13:36,686 --> 02:13:38,596
I say, knock on it.

1442
02:13:38,846 --> 02:13:40,437
Okay. Okay.

1443
02:13:45,606 --> 02:13:46,958
Yes, Lord.

1444
02:13:47,966 --> 02:13:49,114
Shall we come out?

1445
02:13:49,206 --> 02:13:51,799
Marjina, this ghost is coming out.

1446
02:13:51,966 --> 02:13:53,034
What will happen now?

1447
02:13:53,126 --> 02:13:56,197
Don't worry. Change
your voice and say it.

1448
02:13:56,566 --> 02:14:00,478
Not now. Only when I clap thrice.

1449
02:14:06,126 --> 02:14:11,324
Not now. Only when I clap thrice.

1450
02:14:11,486 --> 02:14:13,316
As you say, Lord.

1451
02:14:14,886 --> 02:14:17,843
Strange. What is all this mess?

1452
02:14:21,406 --> 02:14:23,600
Aflatoon, this is a not mess.

1453
02:14:24,046 --> 02:14:29,324
God has given me a good
opportunity of fulfilling my vow.

1454
02:14:29,886 --> 02:14:31,079
Listen.

1455
02:14:36,526 --> 02:14:38,277
What are you saying?

1456
02:14:38,686 --> 02:14:40,755
Are you out of your mind?

1457
02:14:40,966 --> 02:14:43,957
You want to insult me by
dancing before a stranger.

1458
02:14:44,046 --> 02:14:46,081
You want to mar my prestige.

1459
02:14:46,486 --> 02:14:47,884
Trust me.

1460
02:14:48,046 --> 02:14:52,243
I won't do
anything that demeans you.

1461
02:14:52,446 --> 02:14:54,322
Yes. Yes. You can't demean me.

1462
02:14:54,406 --> 02:14:57,124
When you show him the
shades of your beauty. .

1463
02:14:57,206 --> 02:14:59,275
When you lure him
with your panache. .

1464
02:14:59,366 --> 02:15:00,957
You'll add to my prestige, right?

1465
02:15:01,046 --> 02:15:02,683
Don't say that for God's sake.

1466
02:15:02,886 --> 02:15:05,558
Let me dance once before him.

1467
02:15:05,806 --> 02:15:07,363
Then I'll never dance again.

1468
02:15:07,446 --> 02:15:08,924
But why?

1469
02:15:09,006 --> 02:15:11,235
This is a long cherished desire.

1470
02:15:11,526 --> 02:15:15,359
This means that you have known
that merchant since a long time.

1471
02:15:15,686 --> 02:15:18,643
Yes.
- And you love him.

1472
02:15:19,606 --> 02:15:22,244
My dance will answer this question.

1473
02:15:22,526 --> 02:15:23,799
Grant me the permission.

1474
02:15:23,886 --> 02:15:25,557
No, Marjina. No.

1475
02:15:25,686 --> 02:15:28,483
I can't grant you the
permission at any cost.

1476
02:15:28,846 --> 02:15:31,313
Then recollect your promise.

1477
02:15:33,366 --> 02:15:34,559
What promise?

1478
02:15:34,966 --> 02:15:39,117
You had said you'll fulfil my
biggest desire once in your life.

1479
02:15:39,206 --> 02:15:40,274
Marjina.

1480
02:15:40,366 --> 02:15:43,482
If you are a man who is true to
his word, then fulfil my desire.

1481
02:15:45,366 --> 02:15:49,119
If I knew that you'd make
such a disgusting wish. .

1482
02:15:49,406 --> 02:15:51,680
. .I would've never
given you my word.

1483
02:15:51,766 --> 02:15:54,563
So, should I believe that
the nobleman of Baghdad. .

1484
02:15:54,646 --> 02:15:57,284
. .Ali Bin Haroon
isn't true to his word?

1485
02:15:57,366 --> 02:15:59,117
He can go back on his word.

1486
02:15:59,246 --> 02:16:01,361
I never break my promise.

1487
02:16:01,606 --> 02:16:04,039
I'll definitely fulfil
the promise I made to you.

1488
02:16:04,206 --> 02:16:07,993
But bear this is mind, this
dance will mark the end of our love.

1489
02:16:08,086 --> 02:16:11,555
I won't share any
relationship with you henceforth.

1490
02:16:47,726 --> 02:16:52,321
''Look at me lovingly. ''

1491
02:16:52,406 --> 02:16:56,034

''You couldn't
understand what's in my heart. ''

1495
02:17:08,766 --> 02:17:13,156
''I'm gazing here. But my
target is someone else. ''

''Look at me lovingly. ''

1497
02:17:17,646 --> 02:17:21,763
''Why are you upset
with your sweetheart?''

1498

Wow. Wow.

1499
02:17:54,366 --> 02:17:58,643
''Let the night draw to a close. ''

1500
02:17:58,726 --> 02:18:02,559
''Let the flame burn
for a little while more. ''

1501
02:18:02,925 --> 02:18:06,997
''The truth will be unravelled. ''

1502
02:18:07,085 --> 02:18:10,838
''Once I show my true colours. ''

1503
02:18:12,646 --> 02:18:16,354
''You couldn't
understand what's in my heart. ''

1504

target is someone else. ''

''Why are you upset
with your sweetheart?''

1507
02:18:41,005 --> 02:18:43,916
Wow. That was great fun.

1508
02:19:06,085 --> 02:19:10,316
''I'll entice you
only with my gestures. ''

1509
02:19:10,406 --> 02:19:14,398
''I won't let anyone get me. ''

1510
02:19:14,606 --> 02:19:18,837
''I'm a breeze. ''

1511
02:19:18,925 --> 02:19:22,883
''Let me just caress you. ''

''Nor the love in my eyes
for you is going to change. ''

1518
02:20:14,606 --> 02:20:22,876
''My path always leads
to the heart of love. ''

Oh, no. Idiot.

1526

Down they go.

1527
02:21:55,086 --> 02:21:58,521
Marjina, what are you doing?

1528
02:21:58,926 --> 02:22:03,203
I'm avenging my parents' death
from the chief of 40 thieves.

1529
02:22:03,646 --> 02:22:05,920
The chief of 40 thieves.

1530
02:22:06,606 --> 02:22:08,004
What are you saying?

1531
02:22:08,166 --> 02:22:10,121
You might have been tricked.

1532
02:22:10,366 --> 02:22:13,038

recognise the. .

No, Marjina. No.

1536
02:22:17,286 --> 02:22:18,638
You are mistaken.

1537
02:22:20,606 --> 02:22:22,357
He is my esteemed guest.

1538
02:22:24,726 --> 02:22:28,240
It seems this girl has gone mad.

1539
02:22:29,126 --> 02:22:30,638
Otherwise, she would
have never dared to. .

1540
02:22:30,726 --> 02:22:33,080
. . behave so haughtily before me.

1541
02:22:34,566 --> 02:22:35,759
Look at her.

1542
02:22:35,846 --> 02:22:37,563
Look at the way
she is staring at me.

1543
02:22:37,646 --> 02:22:39,840
As if I'm really
some thief or a robber.

1544
02:22:45,086 --> 02:22:46,234
Laugh all you want.

1545
02:22:46,326 --> 02:22:47,599
Clap all you want.

1546
02:22:47,686 --> 02:22:50,722
Now, no one can save you
from the clutches of death.

1547
02:22:51,166 --> 02:22:52,518
Got it?

1548
02:22:52,926 --> 02:22:55,120
You've gone insane.

1549
02:22:55,286 --> 02:22:58,402
You could be cured only
by the oil in the barrels.

1550
02:23:00,366 --> 02:23:01,923
Is anyone around?

1551
02:23:02,806 --> 02:23:04,033
Is anyone around?

1552
02:23:04,126 --> 02:23:05,683
Coming.

1553
02:23:05,766 --> 02:23:07,118
Coming, Master. Coming.

1554
02:23:07,206 --> 02:23:08,638
Here I come.

1555
02:23:09,126 --> 02:23:10,717
The slave is at your service.

1556
02:23:10,806 --> 02:23:13,683
Now, don't clap, but beat the drums.

1557
02:23:13,766 --> 02:23:18,793
But I have sent your men to a
place where no sound can reach.

1558
02:23:18,886 --> 02:23:19,954
What do you mean?

1559
02:23:20,046 --> 02:23:22,957
I mean I have thrown
your 40 thieves along. .

1560
02:23:23,046 --> 02:23:26,924
. .with the barrel into a ocean of
fire from the peak of the mountain.

1561
02:23:27,206 --> 02:23:29,639
So, that means
you've killed everyone.

1562
02:23:29,726 --> 02:23:31,397
Yes. I've killed everyone.

1563
02:23:31,486 --> 02:23:32,679
Now, it's your turn.

1564
02:23:32,766 --> 02:23:34,517
How about that?
- Idiot.

1565
02:23:34,606 --> 02:23:36,755
What have you done?

1566
02:23:37,206 --> 02:23:39,639
Lord, surround this
wretched man and kill him.

1567
02:23:39,726 --> 02:23:41,955
Don't let the prey get away.

1568
02:23:46,326 --> 02:23:47,519
Beware. Don't step forward.

1569
02:23:47,606 --> 02:23:49,641
Her life and death is in my hands.

1570
02:23:49,726 --> 02:23:50,953
You coward.

1571
02:23:51,046 --> 02:23:52,842
You're using a woman as a shield.

1572
02:23:52,926 --> 02:23:55,564
Everything is fair in love and war.

1573
02:23:55,646 --> 02:23:58,842
To save one's life and to
get away from amongst one's. .

1574
02:23:58,926 --> 02:24:00,881
. .enemy is not a
cowardice act, but a brave one.

1575
02:24:00,966 --> 02:24:02,478
Stop right there.

1576
02:24:03,326 --> 02:24:06,044
Let me go.

1577
02:24:06,526 --> 02:24:08,004

Lord is on his way
here with madam Marjina.

Thanks a lot, God.

1601

I'll get them married today itself.

1602
02:31:31,126 --> 02:31:33,434
Madam, it would be really nice if. .

. .you do something about
both of us along with them.

02:31:35,686 --> 02:31:38,518
Great. You uninvited guest.

1605
02:31:38,606 --> 02:31:40,482
How could you think I'll marry him?

1606
02:31:40,566 --> 02:31:43,921
Madam, I'm not going to
marry this pauper at any cost.

1607
02:31:44,006 --> 02:31:47,315
And what if I make
him a millionaire.

1608
02:31:52,446 --> 02:31:55,039
Think about it. A millionaire.

1609
02:31:55,486 --> 02:31:57,760
Lord, then there is
nothing to think about.

1610
02:31:57,846 --> 02:31:59,836
We'll get engaged and then
married in a jiffy. - Okay.

Lord, thanks a lot.

But I hope you
won't change your mind.

1614
02:32:08,406 --> 02:32:09,520
No. Not at all.

1615
02:32:09,606 --> 02:32:13,154
Then Lord, hang on a minute.
Now, let me think.

1616
02:32:13,886 --> 02:32:15,398
What is it that you're thinking now?

1617
02:32:15,486 --> 02:32:17,999
Lord, I was thinking since
you've made a rich man. .

. .why don't I marry
some rich princess.
