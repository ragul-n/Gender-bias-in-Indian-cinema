1
00:01:39,428 --> 00:01:40,590
Did you finish practising?

2
00:01:41,026 --> 00:01:41,674
Yes master.

3
00:01:42,296 --> 00:01:48,203
Chakri! Karate, kung Fu & kick boxing which you are practising now.

4
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:53,894
Do you know the real motto of these martial arts?

5
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,359
Non-violence!

6
00:01:58,681 --> 00:01:59,563
Ahimsa (Non-violence)

7
00:02:01,223 --> 00:02:01,723
Yes

8
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:10,085
But, for the people who keep watching & who are interested in fighting

9
00:02:11,118 --> 00:02:13,597
This is an art of war.

10
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:19,169
It is a great learning to the people who knows the importance of it.

11
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:28,448
This is an art for self-defence.

12
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,294
Where is Rohit?

13
00:03:02,686 --> 00:03:06,986
Rohit! Why do you practise so much to fight against a local guy?

14
00:03:07,247 --> 00:03:08,025
Local fellow?

15
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,058
Yes, that government college guy Chakri.

16
00:03:16,298 --> 00:03:17,080
Here, hold like this.

17
00:03:19,586 --> 00:03:20,279
Do it correctly!

18
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:24,544
Do you know why I like Kick boxing so much? - Why?

19
00:03:25,536 --> 00:03:32,542
Blood! I like the blood & pain which is visible in the opponent by our punch power.

20
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:44,815
Looks like government folks are practising hard. - But for which child is play?

21
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:53,184
Not everyone who practises becomes a champion.

22
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:55,465
Model college guys are heroes.

23
00:03:56,398 --> 00:04:00,173
Government college guys are Zeroes.

24
00:04:01,684 --> 00:04:04,020
Look! Be sportive towards sports.

25
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,146
And do not try to create rivalry between colleges.

26
00:04:08,371 --> 00:04:10,245
We will get to know who the winner is in the coming match.

27
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:14,020
You are a better lecturer than a coach.

28
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,805
No man can defeat model college while I am here. Impossible!

29
00:04:25,538 --> 00:04:32,489
As your parents are rich, you will definitely be arrogant & say so.

30
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,441
It is confirm that Chakri is going to win this year.

31
00:04:36,872 --> 00:04:41,355
Only then model college guys will realize what government college is.

32
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,345
So, Mr Surya, How far did you guys practise?

33
00:04:47,863 --> 00:04:51,811
Mr Vishwanathan, Your son is the champion in this upcoming inter college championship.

34
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,500
There is no doubt about it!

35
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:56,840
No, no, not just inter college championship but also on a national level.

36
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:57,831
That is my ambition.

37
00:04:58,483 --> 00:05:01,758
My son should achieve what I could not do.

38
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:06,697
It will definitely happen! Consider what I am saying is the truth.

39
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:09,905
You came! Was thinking why are not you here yet.

40
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:16,903
You always come & go when he is here, would you tell what is the connection between you both.

41
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:19,925
Actually, Without seeing Mr Vishwanathan..

42
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:22,611
You do not feel like having coffee or breakfast.

43
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:27,692
You are correct. Moreover, we are friends even before this canteen was put up.

44
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:31,567
So, you are dependent on him since then.

45
00:05:32,597 --> 00:05:35,630
It is going to be like this, if you treat a cook as your family member.

46
00:05:36,272 --> 00:05:40,019
Excuse me, this dialogue should be said by him & not you.

47
00:05:41,059 --> 00:05:42,079
What difference does it make?

48
00:05:42,531 --> 00:05:50,921
Anyhow, get Bournvita in this flask, & Horlicks in this for my second wife.

49
00:05:52,267 --> 00:05:52,465
Where did I keep it?

50
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:57,478
And in this. - I understood, milk for your kids. What else!

51
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:02,947
Greetings Master! - Greetings Chakri! May you long live!

52
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:08,269
He is a well-mannered man, serves coffee & clean the cups.

53
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:14,256
Not just that, he also serves without hesitating to his college mates if they are here.

54
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,375
That is why, I wish to have a son like him if I get married at this age.

55
00:06:18,748 --> 00:06:20,939
But, why not like his second son?

56
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,515
He is okay & he is mischievous. I do not want like him.

57
00:06:26,105 --> 00:06:28,372
What Sudha! Did you prepare good at least for this semester?

58
00:06:28,714 --> 00:06:34,540
What preparation! As India is not into semi finals I prepared for science instead of maths.

59
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:36,395
Will you at least pass this time?

60
00:06:36,906 --> 00:06:39,460
I can only write but cannot guarantee it.

61
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,318
Hi Subramanyam! - Subhash!

62
00:06:53,351 --> 00:06:58,046
What son! You are here with plasters all over you. Why did you come in this condition?

63
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:58,805
It is exam day sir.

64
00:06:59,526 --> 00:07:00,464
Oh my goodness.

65
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:06,758
Come! Nowadays kids are wasting their parents money just like that.

66
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,267
Whereas you are here directly from hospital to write the exam. You are not an ordinary man.

67
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:13,962
Andhra student! You are an Andhra student.

68
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:17,879
Sit carefully. If any nail there, will have to plaster your back as well.

69
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:23,127
Sir! Will you write Om for me?

70
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:26,783
You are unable to write Om & how will you write the exam?

71
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,264
It is a small sentiment sir.

72
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:31,453
You have got me with your sentiment.

73
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:34,967
It is a great thing that you are here directly from the hospital.

74
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:39,161
Not just Om, I will write everything & give.

75
00:07:40,215 --> 00:07:40,415
Give me the pen.

76
00:07:44,503 --> 00:07:46,477
It is perfect! All the best.

77
00:07:49,422 --> 00:07:51,873
Yes dear, you look like a very intelligent student.

78
00:07:54,221 --> 00:07:55,283
How come you failed exams in march?

79
00:07:55,714 --> 00:07:57,013
As there was not a proper supervisor.

80
00:07:57,401 --> 00:07:59,456
Why? What did he do? - He did not write Om properly.

81
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,843
You have failed because he did not write Om properly?

82
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,323
I have written it perfectly & you will pass.

83
00:08:44,486 --> 00:08:50,840
Hey! Have you made me write Om just to copy from this & write?

84
00:08:51,611 --> 00:08:56,329
Oh my goodness! He has a list of all chapters!

85
00:08:57,554 --> 00:09:02,307
What? What? You have kept this in your leg. Stand up on the chair!

86
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:06,560
What? Are you dancing?

87
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:15,299
Is this your leg or a garbage bin?

88
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:16,518
It is Vikram Guide Sir.

89
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,390
Let me see which chapter is where!

90
00:09:22,643 --> 00:09:25,077
Aurangzeb is history is in Manohar is pocket!

91
00:09:27,575 --> 00:09:28,756
What happened Sir?

92
00:09:29,678 --> 00:09:33,568
What son! You did everything you should not, & why have you kept your face like a milk drinking child.

93
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:39,050
Here it is written that your pocket has Aurangzeb is history. Take it out.

94
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:43,207
Hey Krishna!

95
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,196
Am I Dushasan & is this a saree or what?

96
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:47,572
Next!

97
00:09:50,128 --> 00:09:55,958
Chandragupta is family is in Shivanand shirt collar. Where is that idiot?

98
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,708
What are you staring at? Will take out your eye balls! Take it out.

99
00:10:01,378 --> 00:10:03,268
I did not copy Sir & here is the proof.

100
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:04,699
I will check.

101
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:11,638
What is this? Looks like the belt on the dog is neck.

102
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,518
Just the belt or do you have a chain too?

103
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:18,749
I will show you proofs, I will show you proofs. Look! Look!

104
00:10:19,904 --> 00:10:22,302
Oh my goodness, what is this? It is like money falling in Tirupati hundi.

105
00:10:22,944 --> 00:10:27,614
Next! Weapons of Ancient is with Jumanji.

106
00:10:29,268 --> 00:10:30,801
Hey! Where is the face you idiot.

107
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,837
It is better covered!

108
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:47,950
Already our history is spoilt & you have spoiled it even more keeping it in under wear.

109
00:10:49,622 --> 00:10:52,831
You both are debarred. Get out.

110
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:55,687
How dare that you copy, debar!

111
00:10:57,683 --> 00:10:59,963
Sir! - What? Why are you calling?

112
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:03,437
Are you trying to bribe me? I will not take a single rupee.

113
00:11:04,594 --> 00:11:05,988
If so, take two rupees then. - Shut your mouth!

114
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,164
Why did you hit me?

115
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:11,011
We should be proud for having such a supervisor!

116
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:14,437
Autograph please!

117
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:19,731
I will not give to these idiots. It is only for you. - Thank you Sir.

118
00:11:21,132 --> 00:11:22,444
Keep it carefully for your entire life.

119
00:11:23,273 --> 00:11:24,379
He will keep! He will keep!

120
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:24,923
Write down.

121
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:30,277
To darling Kamala. - The Botany teacher.

122
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:34,149
You still being a bachelor, & me with a dozen kids.

123
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,156
I am thankful to you for agreeing to be my second setup.

124
00:11:38,974 --> 00:11:42,124
The decoration of the flat is not completed yet which I took for you.

125
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,059
We will shift the moment it is done. Regards, Kameshwar Rao.

126
00:11:46,737 --> 00:11:47,757
With love, Kamesh.

127
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,144
Is it Economics Kameshwar Rao? - No, it is English Kameshwar Rao.

128
00:11:54,272 --> 00:11:55,969
That means it is me. - Yes, it is you.

129
00:11:56,606 --> 00:11:59,762
That letter will be given to your wife if you debar us.

130
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:02,136
And you will be divorced at this age.

131
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:04,325
Hey! We are out two hours early.

132
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:06,667
What shall we do? - Let us go to the internet coffee shop.

133
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:11,585
We are not allowed in the internet shop & no cash to have a smoke.

134
00:12:12,242 --> 00:12:15,482
You innocent fellow, why to worry when we have Janaki as Reserve bank.

135
00:12:18,408 --> 00:12:21,315
The bad time is passed, shall we start now!

136
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:24,375
He always starts when the class is about to finish in 10 minutes.

137
00:12:25,027 --> 00:12:27,602
The bell rings the moment he says the chapter name as usual.

138
00:12:28,476 --> 00:12:31,041
Today is chapter is Abhigyana Shakuntalam

139
00:12:31,827 --> 00:12:33,289
In this chapter...

140
00:12:34,729 --> 00:12:36,447
Hey! Who drew my sketch?

141
00:12:46,786 --> 00:12:48,334
Hi Jaanu! - Hi.

142
00:12:49,354 --> 00:12:53,480
It is you? - Yes! - Why have you come? Did you already finish your exam?

143
00:12:53,914 --> 00:12:54,909
I wanted to write, but they did not allow me.

144
00:12:55,603 --> 00:13:00,377
Copying again! You are stupid, the next attempt is march itself.

145
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,012
That is okay! Jaanu! Jaanu! Jaanu! Give me a hundred.

146
00:13:03,601 --> 00:13:06,895
Why? To have fun near the internet shop with your friends.

147
00:13:07,725 --> 00:13:10,970
I do not have. - I am requesting you. It is better if you give if not, - If not?

148
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:12,057
Hey Avadhanlu!

149
00:13:13,804 --> 00:13:15,206
Who is that calling like a classmate?

150
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:18,769
It is Dushant Sir! - Very good, that you have reminded.

151
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:25,561
In the beginning of the chapter, Dushant goes to his father & says.

152
00:13:25,802 --> 00:13:28,563
Daddy! Daddy! I want to go to the forest.

153
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:32,947
He did not allow him to go. No, no, I will go to the forest and...

154
00:13:33,465 --> 00:13:34,173
I do not have, go!

155
00:13:35,076 --> 00:13:37,926
And I should believe this. Look, how will I get it!

156
00:13:40,315 --> 00:13:42,549
Dushant entered the forest with the same speed.

157
00:13:43,641 --> 00:13:47,575
The moment he entered a deer hopped towards him.

158
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:52,315
Why are you all laughing? It is not English lady, it is Telugu lady.

159
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,498
Then, he took his arrow & tried to aim at it.

160
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,656
It did not come. He tried again, & it did not come again.

161
00:14:03,298 --> 00:14:05,537
He tried again & again, & still it did not come.

162
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:12,710
He tried again. The hand came off and the arrow did not.

163
00:14:13,308 --> 00:14:14,010
But the arrow is still here.

164
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:21,853
What is this? He looked behind as the slipped arrow was still there itself.

165
00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:25,550
Nobody is there, the arrow is not stuck too & he tried again.

166
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:32,643
It did not come, tried again & again, it did not come, so he tried harder!

167
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:34,437
Look! - Give dear!

168
00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:44,028
Do I not know about my Jaanu, 10120 rupees with this since 5th class.

169
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:50,048
Mother, Will I fall on you purposely? It happened accidentally!

170
00:14:50,827 --> 00:14:53,991
I will complain to the principal. - No! No! Mother. Why do you complain to the principal?

171
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:56,136
My match has been fixed recently.

172
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,365
What shall I do now? Did I do anything wrong?

173
00:14:59,827 --> 00:15:01,401
See you later Avadhanlu! - Okay bye!

174
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:04,105
When did this Subramanyam come?

175
00:15:04,615 --> 00:15:06,511
After the bad time passed Sir. - Then it is definitely his job.

176
00:15:07,688 --> 00:15:08,928
Please trust what I am saying!

177
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:08,443
Hi friends!

178
00:16:10,372 --> 00:16:13,709
You are putting a scar every minute. Where did you come from? - Punjab!

179
00:16:14,401 --> 00:16:22,488
Punjab? - Yes! I had a barber shop there for a year, & later realized that it is waste to keep a barber shop in Punjab.

180
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,407
Or a cool drink shop in Kashmir!

181
00:16:35,456 --> 00:16:36,141
I want to go inside.

182
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:45,716
This is for model college boys & not for government college guys.

183
00:18:25,827 --> 00:18:31,381
I will explain you about the Andhra student

184
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:37,975
I will wear different attire that no one can imagine

185
00:18:56,179 --> 00:18:57,536
Lovely girls are our target

186
00:18:58,049 --> 00:18:59,742
We do not care about the risk

187
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:03,983
We create a new sensation

188
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,237
By saying our student life is best none can compete with us

189
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:13,176
Will do whatever he likes, like an Andhra student

190
00:20:30,993 --> 00:20:34,355
Ruff and tuff is our motto, playing rough is Mannerism

191
00:20:36,186 --> 00:20:38,911
We challenge that we are Fashion guys

192
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:43,442
Height is waste what we wear is the best

193
00:20:43,745 --> 00:20:47,935
I do not care if you will not understand

194
00:22:09,956 --> 00:22:13,675
I will be life in every street

195
00:22:14,398 --> 00:22:17,768
I will steal all your hearts

196
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:22,215
We will show our dare and make place in your heart

197
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,917
You will fly high like a rocket if someone loves you

198
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,397
Hey Subbu! I am feeling hungry, come soon.

199
00:23:17,491 --> 00:23:23,879
I am tensed whenever he cooks, his duty is to cook two days a week, & breaks half a dozen of plates & glasses every time he cooks.

200
00:23:24,387 --> 00:23:25,471
Hey elderly person, if I come there...

201
00:23:26,317 --> 00:23:30,216
No matter how many plates you break, your cooking is awesome.

202
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,315
Your father is planning to make him the permanent cook in the canteen.

203
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:36,872
I do not mind, but I am just thinking about you.

204
00:23:50,072 --> 00:23:53,016
Hey! That is not for us, it is for him, he likes this very much.

205
00:23:54,206 --> 00:23:56,960
Finish it. - Anyhow, he likes me a lot.

206
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,135
Why does it taste so worse?

207
00:24:04,716 --> 00:24:10,424
Hey old man! You must stick to your words. You said it is great when I served this last week.

208
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:15,340
Why do you say it is worse now? - Is this a week old curry? - Yes.

209
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,677
If not, will I do specially for you? Just have it.

210
00:24:34,481 --> 00:24:37,102
Come daddy, food is cooked just now & it is hot.

211
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,504
Even he is hot.

212
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,517
You look so excited, did your exams go so good?

213
00:24:42,264 --> 00:24:43,688
I wrote everything without leaving a bit.

214
00:24:44,496 --> 00:24:46,060
You have started with Om it seems!

215
00:24:49,496 --> 00:24:52,810
Copying in exams, & blackmailing the supervisor, are not you ashamed of it?

216
00:24:53,499 --> 00:24:57,596
You missed it in March, thought you would read well & clear at least in September.

217
00:24:58,464 --> 00:24:59,932
I would have written well if I was not caught.

218
00:25:00,572 --> 00:25:06,956
Subbu! - Subbu! - We named him as Subramanyam & he calls himself as Subhash.

219
00:25:07,896 --> 00:25:11,070
He does not value the name given by the parents.

220
00:25:11,703 --> 00:25:14,658
He has a good name as Chakri! And me Subbu Subramanyam!

221
00:25:15,292 --> 00:25:18,754
I am unable to bare it. - Hey! That is your grandfather’s name.

222
00:25:20,315 --> 00:25:23,702
It is better to name schools & colleges by this name & not kids.

223
00:25:24,528 --> 00:25:28,674
You would have completed your second year, if you had shown this smartness in studies.

224
00:25:28,968 --> 00:25:30,739
Do not worry daddy, he will study. - And you! Why do you support him?

225
00:25:31,264 --> 00:25:33,406
It is because of you he is behaving like this.

226
00:25:33,609 --> 00:25:38,992
His friends are passing in first class & he is just roaming throughout the year.

227
00:25:39,714 --> 00:25:42,192
Going behind girls & just roaming with friends.

228
00:25:44,254 --> 00:25:46,633
You know to eat on time but not to study on time. Idiot!

229
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:50,471
It is always like this. You always scold while eating.

230
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:53,562
One must not believe the man who cries.

231
00:25:56,489 --> 00:26:00,125
I do not need this, I prepared this with hard work, you may eat.

232
00:26:00,783 --> 00:26:01,705
Eat. You also eat well.

233
00:26:02,381 --> 00:26:04,311
It will not digest. Hey son! Hey Subbu!

234
00:26:05,643 --> 00:26:07,526
What daddy? You scold him while eating.

235
00:26:07,831 --> 00:26:10,911
So that he would realize why is he eating & what is he doing!

236
00:26:12,941 --> 00:26:15,052
Super! Only you should prepare the mutton curry!

237
00:26:15,687 --> 00:26:17,551
Subbu likes this curry very much.

238
00:26:18,294 --> 00:26:20,722
Who that Subramanyam? Which curry does he not like?

239
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,031
Why are you friends with him? Do not you have girls in your class? You always roam with his gang.

240
00:26:25,523 --> 00:26:27,770
And you do not listen if I tell you go & study at grandmother is place.

241
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:32,626
What daddy! We both have grown up together.

242
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,864
You did not grow together, but he grew being with you.

243
00:26:35,366 --> 00:26:36,888
You gave your slate when he broke his slate.

244
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:38,693
And gave your books too.

245
00:26:39,395 --> 00:26:42,021
Also helped him with the fees. - Hi Kutumba Rao!

246
00:26:43,249 --> 00:26:45,736
Did you see, he is here on the right time!

247
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,978
What Subramanyam! What is happening? - Subhash!

248
00:26:48,738 --> 00:26:50,278
What Sir came here at this time?

249
00:26:52,697 --> 00:26:53,867
Mother! Please give me something!

250
00:26:54,635 --> 00:26:56,026
These beggars have no other work.

251
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,360
Actually, want to improve general knowledge by reading Hindi newspaper

252
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:22,575
You will get fat & ugly by eating this meat.

253
00:27:23,355 --> 00:27:24,609
That is an English paper!

254
00:27:25,963 --> 00:27:26,727
Translation!

255
00:27:28,578 --> 00:27:31,488
Wash your hands Uncle. - Oh! Do not I know that?

256
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:38,428
Keep the remaining curry in the fridge, can be used tomorrow morning.

257
00:27:39,122 --> 00:27:39,904
Keep it in deep freeze Jaanu.

258
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:42,257
Do not chit-chat with him for long, come & sleep soon.

259
00:27:43,643 --> 00:27:45,177
I will also leave uncle, good night.

260
00:27:45,503 --> 00:27:47,056
Good night! Good night! - Good night Jaanu!

261
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:51,436
He is doing too much.

262
00:27:56,289 --> 00:27:58,401
Oh my goodness! Come soon & sleep. - Okay! Okay!

263
00:28:09,764 --> 00:28:12,743
Hey! I came out of the house with pride, what happened to you guys?

264
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:17,555
Did we participate in freedom fighting to receive awards, it is the same story in everybody is house.

265
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,796
My father put me on the floor & bit me!

266
00:28:21,358 --> 00:28:23,892
Hey! Is your father mad? - Yes, he became mad after your dad bit him.

267
00:28:24,474 --> 00:28:25,837
Hey Jumanji! - What?

268
00:28:26,856 --> 00:28:28,858
Are you too thrown out of the house?

269
00:28:29,116 --> 00:28:32,861
I am getting hiccups since morning, so going to the hospital.

270
00:28:33,374 --> 00:28:34,368
Hiccups? - Yes!

271
00:28:35,026 --> 00:28:36,194
Shall I? - Go on!

272
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:40,136
Why did you hit me? - Hiccups will vanish if you get shocks.

273
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:43,217
But my father is getting hiccups, not me.

274
00:28:44,043 --> 00:28:50,666
You should say this before he hits you, do the same to your father he will not get hiccups in his life.

275
00:28:56,382 --> 00:29:00,450
Subbu, Why all this? This would have not happened if you study.

276
00:29:01,358 --> 00:29:02,936
You are spoiling being friends with these guys.

277
00:29:03,684 --> 00:29:06,271
What? Is he getting spoiled because of us?

278
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:09,329
He is all by himself, he may spoil you too.

279
00:29:10,195 --> 00:29:12,301
Hey! Where are you going? - To give food to Subbu.

280
00:29:12,857 --> 00:29:14,608
He cannot starve for long. He cannot tolerate.

281
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,056
Cannot he tolerate? Look there once.

282
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:19,110
Hey you!

283
00:29:20,629 --> 00:29:24,187
Wherever you leave him, he will live as a king, he has got that talent.

284
00:29:28,088 --> 00:29:29,459
Why did you destroy it?

285
00:29:34,518 --> 00:29:36,404
Hey Subhash! Look behind once.

286
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,119
What is it? - It is 1942 love story.

287
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,326
In which theatre? - In bus stop theatre.

288
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,464
Oh! You speaking about Shanti. Is it? Is my bro also watching?

289
00:29:47,856 --> 00:29:50,057
He is looking as he is watching cricket world cup.

290
00:29:50,348 --> 00:29:51,360
Is Shanti blushing?

291
00:29:54,238 --> 00:29:57,514
She is blushing like the actress Vijay shanti, you may look behind.

292
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:00,637
In response to that he will give a short smile. Did he?

293
00:30:02,648 --> 00:30:05,634
He is smiling as Sachin Tendulkar in Colgate advertisement.

294
00:30:06,128 --> 00:30:07,645
Is Shanti also smiling now?

295
00:30:11,496 --> 00:30:13,776
She is laughing closing her eyes like film actress.

296
00:30:15,045 --> 00:30:16,755
That is it! They will not move an inch further.

297
00:30:17,569 --> 00:30:19,701
I am watching this love story since 7th class.

298
00:30:22,644 --> 00:30:24,546
Hey! How dare you throw a rocket to me?

299
00:30:25,118 --> 00:30:28,458
Wait! I will throw missiles at you.

300
00:30:29,516 --> 00:30:31,565
I mean half yearly exam marks papers.

301
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:34,999
What is this dust? He already has dust allergy.

302
00:30:35,898 --> 00:30:37,680
This dust is from your head itself.

303
00:30:38,308 --> 00:30:46,471
You gave just 100 grams of answers for 1 Kg questions Now we will get to know what your history is!

304
00:30:47,561 --> 00:30:51,133
Firstly, as usual ladies first.

305
00:30:51,973 --> 00:30:52,622
Janaki!

306
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:58,649
Like always you have got the first rank, & scored 92 out of 100.

307
00:31:00,061 --> 00:31:01,095
What happened to the rest 8 marks?

308
00:31:01,687 --> 00:31:03,791
The crow took it. - Oh! We thought it is father took it.

309
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,210
Susheela! - Sushi! - Shut up!

310
00:31:08,376 --> 00:31:08,881
Hey Shiva! It is your girl.

311
00:31:09,658 --> 00:31:14,251
You got 19 out of 100. - Sushi is age is 19 & her marks also 19.

312
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:20,505
What dear? Every time you score 20. How come you got a mark less this time?

313
00:31:20,993 --> 00:31:23,947
On the day of exam, my mother asked me to wash clothes & go.

314
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,746
Why? Is your father not at home? - No, he went to the camp.

315
00:31:27,388 --> 00:31:27,966
Say like this! Take it.

316
00:31:28,396 --> 00:31:34,178
You are the brave girl who washes clothes!

317
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:40,067
You are the golden hand who washes utensils.

318
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,269
That is super timing sir!

319
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:47,555
Next! The zero Sarasvati. Come girl, come!

320
00:31:49,027 --> 00:31:51,412
Zero out of 100. You have raised your house name.

321
00:31:52,004 --> 00:31:58,635
Do not worry that you cannot study!

322
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:01,989
Son! Calm down son!

323
00:32:03,415 --> 00:32:04,316
Shut your mouth!

324
00:32:05,143 --> 00:32:08,728
You are next, Kodanda Rama Manoharan! - That is me!

325
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:12,878
13 out of 100.

326
00:32:14,021 --> 00:32:18,933
What is this? You scored just 13 even if you copy from others?

327
00:32:19,329 --> 00:32:20,788
What shall I do if they do not study?

328
00:32:22,096 --> 00:32:27,499
Kodanda Rama is a small baby! Kodanda Rama is a small baby!

329
00:32:28,352 --> 00:32:28,602
Hey sit!

330
00:32:29,303 --> 00:32:32,017
You are doing too much! - You sit down!

331
00:32:32,353 --> 00:32:33,301
Say like this, I will sit.

332
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:42,108
Now, it is a V.I.P. is paper, who is putting all his efforts to ruin this college

333
00:32:42,235 --> 00:32:47,352
Do you want to see the idiot Subramanyam’s paper?

334
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,424
Yes, we want to see.

335
00:32:51,396 --> 00:32:56,540
If you don't announce 99 of 100, I will give the letter you wrote to Kamala madam to your wife, be careful!

336
00:33:03,547 --> 00:33:10,790
What a paper! Our Subhash is the most brilliant student in whole Andhra.

337
00:33:11,675 --> 00:33:15,957
9 out of 100, sorry, it is 99 out of 100.

338
00:33:18,024 --> 00:33:21,318
99? More than me? Show me the paper!

339
00:33:22,936 --> 00:33:27,369
Girl, if I open this paper my paper will be closed!

340
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:29,426
There is some cheating in this. - Hey!

341
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:31,536
Hey! - Hey!

342
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:35,958
The bell has rang, so compromise! - It is time for the match, let us go!

343
00:33:37,147 --> 00:33:40,714
Ladies & gentlemen! Welcome to the kick boxing championship.

344
00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:44,794
The final contestant is Chakri from Government College.

345
00:33:49,385 --> 00:33:53,588
The opponent is Rohit of Model College, the last year champion.

346
00:37:03,743 --> 00:37:04,475
Hey brother!

347
00:37:06,764 --> 00:37:10,344
Why are you like this? Because you lost the match?

348
00:37:12,857 --> 00:37:13,476
Shall I say something?

349
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,220
Forget it!

350
00:37:19,918 --> 00:37:21,822
No use. Will have to say something special.

351
00:37:24,048 --> 00:37:30,710
Arjun! I mean Chakradhara, you have to be strong in such times.

352
00:37:31,888 --> 00:37:37,966
Will we destroy the theatre if the film is not good? Or will we break the cassette if the song is not good?

353
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:42,682
Who will win & who loses, it is all in God is hand.

354
00:37:43,613 --> 00:37:45,559
We are extremely happy with your advices.

355
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:51,798
He is not sad because he lost, he is thinking on how to win the next match?

356
00:37:52,051 --> 00:37:53,682
That is the winning spirit required.

357
00:37:54,254 --> 00:37:58,636
If he is dedicated he will definitely win in the coming years.

358
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:03,342
For him, you encourage as this match or the other.

359
00:38:03,938 --> 00:38:07,089
Did you ever encourage me that if not march, you have September!

360
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:10,808
If you are useful, I would have encouraged you.

361
00:38:24,337 --> 00:38:29,794
Hey, you & your style. At least give me one comb, customer is waiting there.

362
00:38:30,478 --> 00:38:34,312
No matter how much you style, you cannot catch hold of the model college guys.

363
00:38:34,902 --> 00:38:36,107
I am watching since intermediate.

364
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:43,204
A comb is not enough to craft this forest. You will need a plough!

365
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:49,445
That red is mine!

366
00:38:52,487 --> 00:38:53,760
That cheetah like dress is mine!

367
00:39:18,652 --> 00:39:19,894
Model College Monalisa!

368
00:39:27,092 --> 00:39:30,928
Lovely! Very nice name.

369
00:39:31,414 --> 00:39:35,292
That means you are my roommate. - Yes, I went to the hostel, they said you would be here.

370
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:38,719
We may live in hostel but this is the main meeting place.

371
00:39:39,266 --> 00:39:44,666
Here everything is free & is sponsored by model college guys.

372
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,157
Is it? - Yes dear, we have to become friends only with the model college guys.

373
00:39:48,421 --> 00:39:50,869
You may speak to the engineering guys if your personality is good.

374
00:39:51,299 --> 00:39:53,585
And you must not even look at the cheap guys.

375
00:39:53,865 --> 00:39:56,237
Cheap guys? - Yes dear, Government college guys.

376
00:39:57,785 --> 00:40:00,286
Very good introduction is given about us to the girl.

377
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:04,129
Here he comes!

378
00:40:05,773 --> 00:40:10,945
Dear, look there, that is Rohit! Champion of our college.

379
00:40:28,419 --> 00:40:29,357
You forget her too.

380
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:34,960
Hi Ruksana! - Hi champion! By the way she is lovely, new comer to our college.

381
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,789
Hello beautiful! I am. - Rohit! Oh! You got it. - Yes champion.

382
00:40:41,867 --> 00:40:42,945
He gave the hand!

383
00:40:45,419 --> 00:40:46,049
What are they talking?

384
00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:49,571
It is visible, but not audible.

385
00:40:50,303 --> 00:40:51,447
I will tell you, listen.

386
00:40:52,985 --> 00:40:54,139
Do you know something? - What dude!

387
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:58,747
I am the one who stole jewellery from the temple in Vijayawada. - Is it?

388
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:04,657
Taking waste hair from the saloon & selling is my side business.

389
00:41:05,328 --> 00:41:07,458
I also have 3 branches. - Oh great!

390
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,093
Will you come along with me to the hospital? - Sure!

391
00:41:10,529 --> 00:41:17,333
Common let us go! - But Rohit why to hospital? - I have a disease called Aids that is why I am wearing a helmet.

392
00:41:19,255 --> 00:41:20,727
Bye you idiots! Will meet you guys if we are alive.

393
00:41:28,557 --> 00:41:37,118
Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you Janaki!

394
00:41:38,486 --> 00:41:39,020
Mind your Business!

395
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:43,426
Will you stop it? People in trains sing better than you.

396
00:41:44,649 --> 00:41:48,033
Just greetings on friends Birthday, nothing else?

397
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:51,772
What is this?

398
00:41:53,056 --> 00:41:54,724
This is cake is sister! And this is Knife is mother!

399
00:41:55,248 --> 00:41:57,334
Totally it is a bun cake!

400
00:41:57,462 --> 00:41:57,854
Is this a cake?

401
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:05,520
Why did you hit me? - If not, how come he insults Jaanu. Where is the special cake we have ordered for her?

402
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,510
Special cake?

403
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:11,022
Sorry Jaanu! Just two minutes. You will cut the cake.

404
00:42:12,826 --> 00:42:16,083
Hey Chakri! How am I looking to you? - Only when you have work.

405
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:17,474
That is why I am given such works.

406
00:42:18,051 --> 00:42:19,329
What kind of works? - Post man jobs!

407
00:42:20,274 --> 00:42:24,646
That Shanti! - Yes Shanti! She gave a letter to you. - A letter to me?

408
00:42:24,974 --> 00:42:26,742
Anyways, am I looking like a kid to you?

409
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:29,148
Even I have got the age to have fun.

410
00:42:29,695 --> 00:42:30,430
Please give it to me!

411
00:42:38,238 --> 00:42:39,314
Hey Chakri! On that third table...

412
00:42:40,462 --> 00:42:43,469
Look how crazy will he go now! - You must have done something.

413
00:42:45,509 --> 00:42:49,513
Dear Chakradhar, you look very handful! Handful?

414
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,424
I did a mistake by making a Malayalam guy write it.

415
00:42:55,227 --> 00:42:55,984
Must be handsome!

416
00:42:57,169 --> 00:42:59,178
Is Vicks the secret for your good skin?

417
00:43:00,629 --> 00:43:02,513
Lux! Lux! - The one which movie stars use?

418
00:43:03,007 --> 00:43:05,265
Correct! Must be Lux.

419
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:10,227
I am ready to ball in love! Ball in love?

420
00:43:11,683 --> 00:43:12,524
What is this ball call?

421
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:16,808
It is not ball, it is fall. - Does it mean so? - Yes it does.

422
00:43:18,087 --> 00:43:26,342
Tell me when your birthday is, I will gift you a catch! - That idiot wrote catch instead of watch!

423
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:30,226
Today is my birthday! Birthday!

424
00:43:31,261 --> 00:43:32,731
Happy birthday to you Shanti!

425
00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:39,016
I could not come to meet you as guests are at my place. Would you please send me a make?

426
00:43:39,676 --> 00:43:42,251
Make? Must be cake as it is her birthday!

427
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:49,034
Ask that Malayalam guy to meet me once. - Why? I want to handshake as his Telugu is better than me.

428
00:43:49,574 --> 00:43:50,996
Here, give it.

429
00:43:52,074 --> 00:43:55,494
Please do not write my name on it.

430
00:43:56,866 --> 00:43:57,593
See you later bro!

431
00:43:58,292 --> 00:43:59,297
Hey Subbu! - What?

432
00:44:00,105 --> 00:44:03,949
Will you give this cake to Shanti? - I cannot, I have to study.

433
00:44:04,662 --> 00:44:05,550
You can give & then study.

434
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:10,958
You will scold if I do not study, & moreover you give me works like these while I want to study.

435
00:44:11,236 --> 00:44:11,868
Shall I go n give?

436
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:18,843

Okay give!

00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:24,573
Give me 100 rupees. - 100 rupees, for what?

440
00:44:24,949 --> 00:44:29,153
You innocent, we also need a candle with the cake. As we do not know it!

441
00:44:29,451 --> 00:44:30,341
Correct! I forgot.

442
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,128
For the balloons!

443
00:44:40,464 --> 00:44:43,410
He is not ordinary! He made an omelette without an egg.

444
00:45:04,418 --> 00:45:06,726
Did you guys know how good my Jaanu is?

445
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:09,161
He likes Jaanu very much.

446
00:45:42,543 --> 00:45:47,360
Try to know what, I have to tell you

447
00:45:49,312 --> 00:45:53,730
I wish to ask.

448
00:46:07,944 --> 00:46:12,389
Express it with confidence

449
00:46:14,242 --> 00:46:18,643
Why are you hiding?

450
00:46:33,675 --> 00:46:38,879
My heart is beating try to understand it’s need

451
00:46:52,798 --> 00:46:57,074
It feels good when I take you in my arms

452
00:48:14,904 --> 00:48:21,067
Look into my eyes you will know who is in it

453
00:48:22,538 --> 00:48:26,743
It is your love who is blushing

454
00:48:30,387 --> 00:48:32,956
Be my naughty dream for ever

455
00:48:34,282 --> 00:48:38,461
What if your wish stays like a dream?

456
00:49:08,411 --> 00:49:14,966
Subbu! Till when like this? How can I express love being a girl?

457
00:49:15,794 --> 00:49:18,559
You express your love first.

458
00:49:23,435 --> 00:49:24,858
When will you say, you dumb!

459
00:49:31,373 --> 00:49:33,157
Where did you & Rohit go yesterday?

460
00:49:33,357 --> 00:49:35,404
We just roamed the city.

461
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:41,596
You are lucky dear! Every girl in the college is behind Rohit, & Rohit is behind you.

462
00:49:41,969 --> 00:49:45,135
Do not be crazy! - Okay! Where is your next meeting?

463
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:51,980
As tomorrow is Sunday, all are going to Ocean park for picnic, you all will be there, and me & Rohit will.

464
00:49:52,737 --> 00:49:53,994
Enjoy dear!

465
00:50:00,803 --> 00:50:03,286
Hey son, what are these poses for?

466
00:50:03,486 --> 00:50:06,268
It is advance booking! Will have to work after degree right.

467
00:50:06,468 --> 00:50:08,281
I.A.S., I.P.S., peons!

468
00:50:10,221 --> 00:50:11,710
We are doing it now as we do not have time later.

469
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:19,260
Not just copying in exams, you are also creating a duplicate degree for yourselves!

470
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,769
Move aside & do not disturb.

471
00:50:29,496 --> 00:50:32,920
Hey son! Will you take a photograph of mine as well?

472
00:50:33,205 --> 00:50:36,126
Yes definitely! Hey Sakshi, take a picture of him.

473
00:50:37,203 --> 00:50:43,016
Sit down! A guy called Malli who is 45 years is missing since few days.

474
00:50:43,243 --> 00:50:48,267
This guy may be roaming near beauty parlours in search for a bride.

475
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:53,144
Shut your mouths. I still did not get a match for me.

476
00:50:53,344 --> 00:50:54,402
You will not get a match too!

477
00:50:58,243 --> 00:51:02,154
What Hi! What if your brother ask about the cake?

478
00:51:05,144 --> 00:51:06,399
Welcome! Sit down. - It is okay!

479
00:51:07,451 --> 00:51:08,782
Give me the items from this list.

480
00:51:09,771 --> 00:51:14,055
Why do you work hard for this? A letter would be enough.

481
00:51:14,255 --> 00:51:15,346
Why letter for this?

482
00:51:18,643 --> 00:51:20,865
The bomb can blast anytime.

483
00:51:23,645 --> 00:51:26,123
Did you get all the items? - Yes I did.

484
00:51:27,842 --> 00:51:28,860
How is the taste?

485
00:51:29,652 --> 00:51:32,569
Not there, ask here. It was super!

486
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:34,915
It will be good as you gave.

487
00:51:35,978 --> 00:51:38,883
Will you also gift me if I tell you when my birthday is?

488
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,022
Look at that table!

489
00:51:44,174 --> 00:51:47,317
When did you come dad? - Are you working?

490
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,304
What is wrong in doing our own work?

491
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:54,174
Thousand rupees! - A thousand rupees?

492
00:51:54,684 --> 00:51:57,252
I would have worked daily if I get thousand daily!

493
00:51:57,473 --> 00:52:00,474
Stop your smartness! Go pay to the supermarket & come.

494
00:52:04,053 --> 00:52:05,209
Hey come let is go to the super market.

495
00:52:05,409 --> 00:52:07,421
We are not in a mood to walk, you carry on.

496
00:52:08,074 --> 00:52:10,016
Me & walking? Never!

497
00:52:11,074 --> 00:52:11,685
Take it.

498
00:52:13,264 --> 00:52:15,145
Eyetex eye liner. Why this now?

499
00:52:15,534 --> 00:52:17,625
To apply & get rid of the bad sight. - To whom, you?

500
00:52:18,549 --> 00:52:24,168
It is for you, as you were looking good with the jacket on your birthday, what did your sister say?

501
00:52:24,443 --> 00:52:26,007
You are the Mahalaxmi with makeup.

502
00:52:26,315 --> 00:52:29,206
Not just that, the entire colony is vision is on Jaanu.

503
00:52:29,452 --> 00:52:35,416
She was like Kashmir apple & became Ronald refill now. May their luck go bad!

504
00:52:36,524 --> 00:52:37,750
Go away! - Not go away, let is go.

505
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:42,817
But where? - Let is make the payment at super market & have a ride of the city.

506
00:52:43,435 --> 00:52:44,516
By the way in which car shall we go?

507
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:50,275
In the car? - Yes, me on driving seat & you beside me. - And we behind you both.

508
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,973
We will just float all over the city.

509
00:52:53,659 --> 00:52:57,876
I cannot come with you guys, dad has asked me to keep an eye while the car is being painted.

510
00:52:58,321 --> 00:53:01,749
As she cannot come we shall go in that car.

511
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:04,809
Put the AC on, it will be cool.

512
00:53:06,114 --> 00:53:07,923
This car is to show off, roll the mirrors down.

513
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:13,742
Hey Subhash, let us go to the ladies hostel, we will make them get down if anyone is ready to get in.

514
00:53:13,942 --> 00:53:14,609
We are not getting out!

515
00:53:26,388 --> 00:53:28,495
Hey Subhash, looks like a new girl.

516
00:53:28,695 --> 00:53:30,994
She may need lift, Shall we help her out.

517
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:36,068
What? She will not even look at the car after looking at your oily faces.

518
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,231
Do one thing. - What?

519
00:53:40,431 --> 00:53:47,440
Contribute a rupee each & apply fair & lovely. - Good idea! Let us go!

520
00:53:49,207 --> 00:53:50,960
No cheating in this right?

521
00:53:52,196 --> 00:53:55,585
This is how you understood my friendship?

522
00:53:57,058 --> 00:53:59,154
This guarantee is enough! Let us go!

523
00:54:09,452 --> 00:54:12,153
I have to go meet a friend urgently! Please!

524
00:54:35,566 --> 00:54:39,616
I did not ask about your blood group. Is your group computers or electronics?

525
00:54:39,816 --> 00:54:40,778
Electronics!

526
00:54:41,217 --> 00:54:43,279
Good choice! This car is looking nice.

527
00:54:43,479 --> 00:54:45,322
Where shall I drop you? - What?

528
00:55:19,071 --> 00:55:21,668
Rohit is bike is here. I think he is already here.

529
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:38,277
Ruksana! Have you seen Rohit around? - Rohit was here itself.

530
00:56:43,953 --> 00:56:46,179
I knew that Subbu would do something like this!

531
00:56:46,379 --> 00:56:47,591
Why do you hit me?

532
00:56:48,456 --> 00:56:50,225
You should have said this long back.

533
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,895
You cheat!

534
00:56:59,524 --> 00:57:02,500
Sir! Look it is our Sir!

535
00:57:03,224 --> 00:57:04,557
Not bad that you recognized me.

536
00:57:04,757 --> 00:57:09,434
How can we forget your help sir? 2 Kms!

537
00:57:11,916 --> 00:57:13,350
They are daily labour in my factory.

538
00:57:14,404 --> 00:57:18,548
You made us walk for 2 Kms & also call us factory labours. Hey!

539
00:57:19,511 --> 00:57:21,094
Subhash! He is being arrogant to you.

540
00:57:21,294 --> 00:57:24,987
Did not he recover his madness yet? - No sir that is why we are taking him to the hospital.

541
00:57:25,326 --> 00:57:29,607
Doctor asked 1000 rs for it, so if you help us out.

542
00:57:29,807 --> 00:57:32,843
Definitely, go to the office & take.

543
00:57:33,794 --> 00:57:40,130
We do not have time sir, if not his madness increases.

544
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:43,956
I am talking here. Hey, hold him tightly.

545
00:57:44,585 --> 00:57:52,161
We will go if you give us the 1000 Rs which you keep aside to give beggars.

546
00:57:52,361 --> 00:57:54,277
You might become beggars if I give you that.

547
00:57:54,477 --> 00:57:57,955
We will not become beggars if you give us that.

548
00:58:02,444 --> 00:58:07,077
Excuse me! T-shirt does not have a pocket upfront. You keep it in your jeans back pocket.

549
00:58:07,637 --> 00:58:09,016
You remember it well.

550
00:58:09,216 --> 00:58:12,222
Our Sir is heart is very big.

551
00:58:13,334 --> 00:58:18,223
Sir, you do not have to count. I remember it is exactly 1000 Rs.

552
00:58:20,435 --> 00:58:25,292
I pray to God that you & your wife should live long!

553
00:58:28,711 --> 00:58:34,591
Madame! Apologies for misunderstanding you. Please forgive us.

554
00:58:34,791 --> 00:58:36,598
It is enough. You may go now!

555
00:58:53,619 --> 00:58:57,581
He looks like our Subbu. Is this double action? - No, single action!

556
00:59:03,209 --> 00:59:04,718
Small brother! - Small brother?

557
00:59:05,477 --> 00:59:08,559
What! He is changing relations. - This is nothing yet, watch more!

558
00:59:09,955 --> 00:59:13,447
Greetings Big brother! - Greetings! - Are you fine? - Yes, I am fine.

559
00:59:13,647 --> 00:59:15,524
How is the business going? - It is all your blessings.

560
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:18,235
Where is your father? - Here he is!

561
00:59:19,368 --> 00:59:21,203
Sorry Sir, he looked like my father.

562
00:59:21,937 --> 00:59:23,157
Elderly person he is!

563
00:59:24,328 --> 00:59:30,046
How is your family? - They are fine, but my brother is still just roaming!

564
00:59:31,623 --> 00:59:34,048
Leave, as he is still a kid.

565
00:59:36,551 --> 00:59:42,256
What all do you have? - Masala dosa! - Mushroom pizza! Spaghetti, etc. etc.

566
00:59:47,011 --> 00:59:48,244
What else do you have sir?

567
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:53,397
This is the problem with these guys! They do not accept bill too.

568
00:59:57,056 --> 00:59:59,222
Hey Malli, how are you? - Very hot!

569
00:59:59,422 --> 01:00:05,112
Correct, the coffee has to be hot. - This Subramanyam is not ashamed at all.

570
01:00:08,655 --> 01:00:10,765
Lovely, may I ask you something? - What is it?

571
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:15,291
You did not come because I asked you, but because you were angry on Rohit.

572
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,681
To say you frankly yes!

573
01:00:19,671 --> 01:00:20,595
You are very lucky!

574
01:00:20,795 --> 01:00:24,096
You do not know about him as you are new to him.

575
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:29,518
If not, like Rita, Meeta, Bata, you would also

576
01:00:34,048 --> 01:00:35,088
This means pregnancy itself right.

577
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:39,572
Rita is the girl whom I saw just now, who is Meeta Bata?

578
01:00:41,243 --> 01:00:43,761
They are fashion college girls.

579
01:00:44,479 --> 01:00:47,380
How dare he play with girls! I will teach him a lesson.

580
01:00:49,385 --> 01:00:50,685
Will you help me with this?

581
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,996
If I feel like contacting you, your cell number.

582
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:03,549
Dad never encouraged me to use the cell phone as it may damage brain

583
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:12,193
He is double 420! He gave the canteen is number!

584
01:01:14,951 --> 01:01:20,134
These girls? I would have married them long ago & also put up a hotel in America

585
01:01:20,642 --> 01:01:31,582
Not like these, the one who has lots of money & colour matching to me Can you set anyone similar to Aiswarya Rai?

586
01:01:31,782 --> 01:01:41,202
Srikanth & Ooha, Rajashekhar & Jeevitha, Nagarjuna & Amala, Sridevi & Bony Kapoor, I got them all married.

587
01:01:41,402 --> 01:01:44,478
You give me some time, I will get Rambha & Urvashi for you.

588
01:01:44,678 --> 01:01:45,775
Who those film actresses?

589
01:01:46,728 --> 01:01:50,041
Hey bro, he cannot set a girl even if you cross 60. - Why so?

590
01:01:50,537 --> 01:01:55,681
We are feeding him since he is trying to find a match for you, he was like rat & now turned into elephant.

591
01:01:55,881 --> 01:02:00,094
He will not get food if he get is a match for you, that is why he is not doing it.

592
01:02:01,164 --> 01:02:05,375
That is why, we have set a match for you, we will proceed if you are ready.

593
01:02:05,575 --> 01:02:07,947
Who? Where? How does she look? Please tell me.

594
01:02:10,839 --> 01:02:11,107
With bangles.

595
01:02:13,707 --> 01:02:14,774
Nose piercing.

596
01:02:16,896 --> 01:02:18,445
Skinny belly.

597
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:28,225
I want someone like this.

598
01:02:29,106 --> 01:02:29,693
Do I not know?

599
01:02:31,515 --> 01:02:32,417
What a timing?

600
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,020
You cannot climb the tree and get toddy.

601
01:02:39,013 --> 01:02:39,271
Is it for me?

602
01:02:40,899 --> 01:02:43,969
You cannot climb the tree and get toddy.

603
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:45,376
Is it so?

604
01:02:46,549 --> 01:02:53,921
Why do you want to get married?

605
01:03:19,168 --> 01:03:21,666
Hello! - Can I speak to Subha please? - Subha?

606
01:03:24,628 --> 01:03:29,069
Hello, Does Subha means our sir Subhash? - Yes!

607
01:03:30,553 --> 01:03:33,448
Girls are calling for our Sir. What is this!

608
01:03:37,464 --> 01:03:39,524
One min sister, I will call him.

609
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:44,045
Shakuntalakiya! Shakuntalakiya!

610
01:03:45,796 --> 01:03:48,598
Yes you, what is our sir doing?

611
01:03:48,798 --> 01:03:51,060
He is putting some tender to a girl.

612
01:03:51,717 --> 01:03:54,009
Oh! He is signing cheque.

613
01:03:55,237 --> 01:03:59,698
You do not know madam, it is very difficult to meet our sir.

614
01:04:00,031 --> 01:04:02,757
He plays shuttle every morning.

615
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:09,684
After that he shaves while sleeping. - What, while sleeping?

616
01:04:10,065 --> 01:04:20,178
After that, hey what is here? Bundle of notes? All these rich people throw their money anywhere!

617
01:04:21,367 --> 01:04:23,733
Our sir is too much. - My goodness!

618
01:04:24,813 --> 01:04:27,997
Mahesh! What happened to that six crore deal? - It is getting ready Sir.

619
01:04:29,239 --> 01:04:32,703
Sir, some girl has called for your sake.

620
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:34,892
Girl calling me? Who is it?

621
01:04:36,014 --> 01:04:37,901
Madame! - Tell it is Lovely!

622
01:04:38,987 --> 01:04:42,612
Some Madame, Lovely! - Lovely?

623
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:56,022
You are working hard! Yes it is tough to act.

624

What? - Yes, board meetings & speaking to labours.

625
01:05:03,826 --> 01:05:05,822
Are you free in the evening? - Me free?

626
01:05:07,584 --> 01:05:12,118
There could be a meaning for free in the dictionary but not for me.

627
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:17,772
It is Lovely who is asking! So Mahesh what are my evening programmes today?

628
01:05:19,602 --> 01:05:22,120

Round table conference with the Russian delegates. Next?

630
01:05:29,263 --> 01:05:34,095
Cancel all my programmes for my lovely sake.

631
01:05:35,409 --> 01:05:37,670
Lovely! When are we going to meet?

632
01:05:38,396 --> 01:05:42,764
5 o clock? - Oh! How romantic!

633
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:57,075
He is very dangerous! If we are not aware, he will sell my kidney to me itself.

634
01:06:05,101 --> 01:06:08,246
Jaanu! My lovely friend Jaanu! Where are you?

635
01:06:12,522 --> 01:06:15,979
Something happens! - Subbu! To whom is this rose for?

636
01:06:16,643 --> 01:06:23,370
I do not need it. Go & give it to some model girl.

637
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:26,348
And they only need cars not flowers.

638
01:06:27,182 --> 01:06:27,518
Take it.

639
01:06:32,735 --> 01:06:35,097
What is that? - Is it not good?

640
01:06:35,947 --> 01:06:36,327
Turn!

641
01:06:38,042 --> 01:06:39,192
Cannot even keep a flower.

642
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,397
Now you look like Titanic heroine.

643
01:06:44,361 --> 01:06:48,657
Is this Honda city? Yes why?

644
01:06:48,712 --> 01:06:51,227
Nothing, actually dad gave some work, so

645
01:06:51,976 --> 01:06:53,245
Okay let us go, I will also come along.

646
01:06:53,691 --> 01:06:55,665
If not you will tell stories while returning.

647
01:06:56,597 --> 01:07:01,243
You will also come? But your dress, my dress & car colour does not match.

648
01:07:01,923 --> 01:07:04,585
Shall I wear the dress which I wore on the festival day? - Yes do that!

649
01:07:05,285 --> 01:07:10,597
Hey Jaanu! You come to the canteen! I will finish a small work & get there.

650
01:07:10,796 --> 01:07:13,584
This car is to be delivered now! - You could have said this earlier.

651
01:07:14,168 --> 01:07:15,372
Give me the address, I will deliver it.

652
01:08:06,556 --> 01:08:07,611
Hey Subha, why are you laughing?

653
01:08:08,434 --> 01:08:11,743
As I just remembered the joke from the coffee shop.

654
01:08:15,627 --> 01:08:19,263
By the way, today is treat is mine. - Oh Lovely! - Please Subha.

655
01:08:30,213 --> 01:08:32,014
Lovely, I want to speak to you. But I do not!

656
01:08:45,389 --> 01:08:47,111
Do not you remember? Now you got it?

657
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,947
These are just stories & you believe all this? - Shut up!

658
01:08:52,557 --> 01:08:53,311
How dare you play with girls?

659
01:09:03,833 --> 01:09:11,235
Hey you Model college guy! Is this your father is place? It is for everybody, understand.

660
01:09:28,045 --> 01:09:29,659
How dare that he insults me!

661
01:09:31,685 --> 01:09:35,303
You should have seen his face when I said about Rita Meeta & Bata.

662
01:09:35,951 --> 01:09:37,616
Not just colours, he also changes characters.

663
01:09:38,297 --> 01:09:40,823
That I am not rich & am son of a canteen owner.

664
01:09:41,197 --> 01:09:45,256
Moreover, which is that cheap college? - You mean Government College?

665
01:09:45,815 --> 01:09:47,521
He will also say that I am a student of it.

666
01:09:59,689 --> 01:10:01,406
Lovely! Will get back in 5 min.

667
01:10:13,683 --> 01:10:15,986
I am coming from the service centre, your car is here ready.

668
01:10:22,915 --> 01:10:24,369
You disturb me while I am speaking to Foreign delegates.

669
01:10:44,585 --> 01:10:46,328
Security! Take the keys & throw him out.

670
01:10:53,897 --> 01:10:55,665
Subhash, why is he scolding you?

671
01:10:57,165 --> 01:10:58,472
Dad is always like this.

672
01:10:59,401 --> 01:11:03,754
Daddy? That means all this - Yes, it is our Palace.

673
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:08,019
Sorry Lovely! I could not introduce as he was upset.

674
01:11:11,334 --> 01:11:14,396
He scolded me as I came late for the meeting.

675
01:11:15,842 --> 01:11:17,491
Sorry Subhash that you are delayed because of me.

676
01:11:18,041 --> 01:11:19,541
I do not know where I will be when.

677
01:11:21,789 --> 01:11:31,142
I may be in London tonight, & in Switzerland a day after, he tie ups with everybody & asks my signature for everything.

678
01:11:31,317 --> 01:11:33,895
Subhash! You are so simple even after being in such status.

679
01:11:38,111 --> 01:11:40,820
Even I feel like roaming with friends like you.

680
01:11:45,592 --> 01:11:51,949
That is why, I will come out like Gautama Buddha with plane cotton clothes someday.

681
01:11:54,865 --> 01:11:58,350
May I expect your support all the time?

682
01:11:59,192 --> 01:12:03,493
Subhash! Elders are always like that, we will have to adjust.

683
01:12:04,147 --> 01:12:06,967
Do not decide to leave all this in a hurry.

684
01:12:29,828 --> 01:12:32,381
It is very different today

685
01:12:34,253 --> 01:12:37,781
Do not know what went wrong

686
01:12:39,646 --> 01:12:45,726
May be its love Where everything I see

687
01:12:45,952 --> 01:12:47,549
I always imagine you

688
01:12:50,507 --> 01:12:52,050
Her smile is thrilling

689
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:07,706
Did he fell in love?

690
01:13:18,772 --> 01:13:22,288
My heart is singing

691
01:13:30,829 --> 01:13:33,992
Love is playing with me.

692
01:13:35,213 --> 01:13:37,640
It is very different today

693
01:13:38,874 --> 01:13:42,158
It is strange, happiness

694
01:13:44,326 --> 01:13:47,281
I think this is love brother.

695
01:13:48,411 --> 01:13:51,715
I see her where ever I turn

696
01:14:48,578 --> 01:14:51,847
My heart is singing

697
01:14:53,243 --> 01:14:55,792
Feels like fresh air

698
01:14:57,376 --> 01:15:00,833
It knocked my door spoke to my heart

699
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:05,275
The birds sang

700
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:26,574
He is singing well

701
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:56,459
Did you fall in love?

702
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:58,495
Yes I fell

703
01:17:14,826 --> 01:17:19,659
You have started to sing, but does Lovely really love you?

704
01:17:19,682 --> 01:17:21,945
Tell! - If flower is given, that also means heart is given.

705
01:17:22,887 --> 01:17:26,839
Not just that, she said will meet tomorrow at Valentines day & tell something important.

706
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:28,739
I will express my love too.

707
01:17:28,939 --> 01:17:35,728
If that really happens, those model college guys should roam in college wearing helmets.

708
01:17:41,859 --> 01:17:46,893
We will not wear helmets, but will cut your heads & make you unable to wear helmets.

709
01:17:47,759 --> 01:17:53,846
Look! Lovely is my girl, be careful if you enter unnecessarily.

710
01:17:55,922 --> 01:17:57,475
What will you do? - Hey!

711
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:03,867
Hey Mister! What is happening?

712
01:18:10,507 --> 01:18:12,135
We will see you later.

713
01:18:13,491 --> 01:18:16,546
Should I say especially to you? Go!

714
01:18:16,743 --> 01:18:19,074
Does lovely really love you. Tell me.

715
01:18:19,274 --> 01:18:26,348
If you want to teach him a lesson, you & Lovely should definitely meet tomorrow.

716
01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:31,948
But do not propose her just with a flower. Anyhow you acted as you are son of a millionaire

717
01:18:32,148 --> 01:18:33,329
Take some costly gift along!

718
01:18:33,529 --> 01:18:35,371
10000 Rs, why?

719
01:18:38,066 --> 01:18:40,295
To gift a beautiful diamond ring to my lover.

720
01:18:42,341 --> 01:18:45,866
Did your lover ask for such valuable gift?

721
01:18:46,857 --> 01:18:50,504
It is enough if you just give flowers.

722
01:18:51,275 --> 01:18:56,416
Flowers my foot! It is not an ordinary day tomorrow. It is Valentines day.

723
01:18:56,616 --> 01:18:59,837
Lovers say what is in their heart on that day.

724
01:19:00,418 --> 01:19:04,084
If you gift something valuable on such occasion, the range is completely different.

725
01:19:04,284 --> 01:19:06,298
Anyways, I do not have that much money.

726
01:19:06,498 --> 01:19:08,887
If you do not have money, Reserve bank also does not.

727
01:19:09,087 --> 01:19:10,303
Jaanu! Jaanu! Please Jaanu!

728
01:19:12,093 --> 01:19:15,841
You are always like this Subbu! Okay wait.

729
01:19:22,886 --> 01:19:23,423
Take it.

730
01:19:29,441 --> 01:19:34,894
Shall I say something, I feel you are born for me whenever you help me out.

731
01:19:37,135 --> 01:19:38,644
Bye Jaanu! Bye.

732
01:19:43,771 --> 01:19:48,931
Why this ring? When you are about to get a new one!

733
01:20:00,721 --> 01:20:04,313
Excuse me! Oh! Thank you brother!

734
01:20:11,271 --> 01:20:12,510
This is the correct match for me.

735
01:20:17,365 --> 01:20:18,969
What is the time? - Get lost!

736
01:20:23,757 --> 01:20:30,989
What Janaki! You said he will tell something on this day. He is still with those monkeys. - You wait.

737
01:20:36,912 --> 01:20:38,515
Shall we go shopping tomorrow? - Why?

738
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:43,850
I have to shop a lot. By the way do you have a city bank card?

739
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:47,332
I have a bus card. Catch this, I will go get the bus!

740
01:20:49,201 --> 01:20:54,585
This Manohar is never going to get a girl in this life. Every girl is booked!

741
01:20:54,785 --> 01:20:57,597
Subbu is the only guy whose love is going to be a success.

742
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:00,837
I am tensed here & you are making me worry.

743
01:21:02,177 --> 01:21:03,608
Everything is okay, what is he tensed for?

744
01:21:03,808 --> 01:21:05,986
Hey! Look he is coming, all the best.

745
01:21:20,599 --> 01:21:25,975
Will you be my friend forever even if you do not like what I say?

746
01:21:31,224 --> 01:21:32,845
I Love you!

747
01:21:40,131 --> 01:21:45,930
I have bought this ring for you as a signature of our love.

748
01:21:51,976 --> 01:21:55,801
Is it enough if I say it like this? Correct! Please tell me!

749
01:22:02,697 --> 01:22:05,102
Look, she is here, wish me all the best, bye.

750
01:22:21,547 --> 01:22:26,688
Lovely! I Love you! - I love you too!

751
01:23:20,843 --> 01:23:23,437
Wait! Wait! Hello! Hello! Mic testing!

752
01:23:25,326 --> 01:23:31,046
Dear students of Government college, today our college name should be in the Guinness book.

753
01:23:32,730 --> 01:23:43,639
Since the time Subbu used to wear shorts, excuse me! To till date he has grown a lot.

754
01:23:43,839 --> 01:23:47,475
It is true that he did not cry when he was born, & said just Love.

755
01:23:48,594 --> 01:23:51,718
The proof is how he fooled Lovely.

756
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:57,239
I am having tears in my eyes by looking at his simplicity.

757
01:23:59,670 --> 01:24:04,882
I want you all government students to take him as an example.

758
01:24:05,082 --> 01:24:10,728
We must get hold of the model college girls, And the boys should call us brother-in-laws!

759
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:15,939
I request the Model college hero Subhash to speak a few words.

760
01:24:20,494 --> 01:24:22,210
Soda Please! - Would you not let me speak?

761
01:24:25,554 --> 01:24:26,979
May I speak now? - Yes! You may.

762
01:24:27,862 --> 01:24:32,561
I want to let you know what I have achieved is nothing & have to achieve much more.

763
01:24:32,761 --> 01:24:40,196
On this achievement, our college lover boy Shiva would like to honour him

764
01:24:40,396 --> 01:24:46,532
And is roaming with a four day old garland, I mean a fresh garland.

765
01:24:46,732 --> 01:24:48,884
Wherever you are come soon!

766
01:24:52,076 --> 01:24:55,930
Hail Big brother! A photograph please! - No photographs, leave!

767
01:24:56,130 --> 01:24:59,543
Now, on behalf of our college, it is A.R. Rahman musical night!

768
01:25:01,364 --> 01:25:07,359
You are the King of the Kings! May you live long forever!

769
01:25:37,418 --> 01:25:39,502
Jaanu! Jaanu!

770
01:25:41,801 --> 01:25:45,262
Jaanu! Jaanu!

771
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:56,786
Hi Jaanu! Why are you still sleeping?

772
01:25:56,986 --> 01:25:59,587
Thought you would get ready neatly like a Mahalaxmi.

773
01:26:00,134 --> 01:26:02,631
Did you have your dad is drink by mistake yesterday night?

774
01:26:07,504 --> 01:26:11,063
And, how come you left yesterday without informing me, do you know how much I searched for you!

775
01:26:13,777 --> 01:26:15,064
Hi Jaanu!

776
01:26:15,988 --> 01:26:17,107
What happened dear?

777
01:26:17,890 --> 01:26:19,632
You have changed a lot Subbu!

778
01:26:21,863 --> 01:26:24,907
Have changed the hair style slightly & trimmed the moustache too.

779
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:31,958
After all I am in love! I am very lucky to get lovely as my lover.

780
01:26:33,742 --> 01:26:35,890
Correct! I am only the unlucky one.

781
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:37,991
Hey! What is wrong with you?

782
01:26:38,191 --> 01:26:43,752
Am I not unlucky if you do not introduce me to your friend lovely?

783
01:26:45,953 --> 01:26:52,590
Me proposing her & her accepting it, and then the diamond ring, it is so thrilling you know!

784
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:54,282
It is thrilling to me as well. - Is it?

785
01:26:54,482 --> 01:27:00,933
You are talking continuously & could not make out that I am suffering fever

786
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:01,857
Fever?

787
01:27:05,709 --> 01:27:10,129
It is boiling & how come he left you here alone? Common let us go to the hospital.

788
01:27:11,518 --> 01:27:12,648
I already visited the hospital.

789
01:27:12,910 --> 01:27:14,872
Okay! Did you take the tablets?

790
01:27:16,297 --> 01:27:18,509
You will not take them. Where are the tablets?

791
01:27:29,887 --> 01:27:32,754
Now take some rest & have fun. Okay!

792
01:27:36,347 --> 01:27:37,137
Subbu!

793
01:27:39,529 --> 01:27:42,665
Why are you leaving without asking for the car?

794
01:27:43,159 --> 01:27:46,911
That is true, but you... - It is okay, you can take it.

795
01:27:50,678 --> 01:27:54,403
You are not Mahalaxmi! You are Varalaxmi, who fulfils wishes.

796
01:29:31,238 --> 01:29:34,843
Hello S.R.Motors! - Daddy! - Janaki!

797
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:37,686
What dear? Did your temperature increase even more?

798
01:29:39,169 --> 01:29:41,110
Nothing as such! - Then what is it?

799
01:29:45,836 --> 01:29:50,624
I will go live in grand mother is village. - Grandmother is village?

800
01:29:51,779 --> 01:29:55,035
Yes! I will go study there itself.

801
01:29:56,263 --> 01:29:57,743
Even you used to say the same.

802
01:29:58,405 --> 01:30:00,785
Yes, but why all of sudden?

803
01:30:01,476 --> 01:30:03,683
I do not feel like living here.

804
01:30:05,061 --> 01:30:06,654
I will go there & live.

805
01:30:07,047 --> 01:30:10,814
If you will to study there sincerely, what else do I require?

806
01:30:11,014 --> 01:30:13,775
You may go when you are okay, now take some rest.

807
01:30:22,103 --> 01:30:25,736
You said will give me a treat & just roaming the city, where are we going?

808
01:30:25,936 --> 01:30:27,980
I am searching for it. What?

809
01:30:28,180 --> 01:30:31,391
I think we missed the address, so searching for it.

810
01:30:32,755 --> 01:30:33,404
Yes! Got it.

811
01:30:38,081 --> 01:30:40,424
Subhash! Everything feels new to me here.

812
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:43,095
It is the same for me too.

813
01:30:43,295 --> 01:30:43,997
But why so?

814
01:30:45,766 --> 01:30:48,941
You do know about me Lovely! Dad had forced me to come here.

815
01:30:50,375 --> 01:30:52,060
Anyways, where are the newly wedding couples? Let us go wish them.

816
01:30:52,717 --> 01:30:55,185
Yes, I am looking for that itself. Here they are!

817
01:30:55,385 --> 01:30:57,708
Hey brother! Congratulations man!

818
01:30:59,492 --> 01:31:01,610
She is Lovely! - Hi!

819
01:31:01,929 --> 01:31:04,050
Rohit! Lovely!

820
01:31:08,611 --> 01:31:11,578
Sorry Bro! Dad could not come as he is busy in a board meeting.

821
01:31:11,778 --> 01:31:13,065
By the way, who are you?

822
01:31:14,896 --> 01:31:18,408
Hello my son! Common! Common!

823
01:31:19,972 --> 01:31:26,236
Do not tell your mom that I am having a small peg, she might feel bad.

824
01:31:27,299 --> 01:31:29,048
Take care of my son.

825
01:31:31,967 --> 01:31:35,156
Subhash! Who is he? - I too do not know.

826
01:31:36,475 --> 01:31:37,333
Hey Mahesh uncle!

827
01:31:37,533 --> 01:31:40,359
Lovely doesn't know them.

828
01:31:41,896 --> 01:31:45,039
But I do not think Subha would be knowing them.

829
01:31:45,239 --> 01:31:48,920
Subhash! You are telling everyone your dad did not come, but he is here!

830
01:31:49,137 --> 01:31:52,706
My dad will not come like I do, - But he is here!

831
01:31:56,995 --> 01:32:00,220
This daddy! Ah... my daddy!

832
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:02,439
Yes! - As he is here, we shall move!

833
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:07,748
No! You go meet him right now, if not he might scold you for not attending the party.

834
01:32:09,772 --> 01:32:10,837
Greetings Sir!

835
01:32:12,646 --> 01:32:13,949
I have seen you somewhere!

836
01:32:15,171 --> 01:32:16,674
Car keys Sir!

837
01:32:17,689 --> 01:32:19,010
Hello my son!

838
01:32:20,962 --> 01:32:24,009
Are you steady? - Yes! - Are you not able to talk?

839
01:32:24,883 --> 01:32:32,465
Look my son, please do not tell anyone in the family that I drank a full bottle, especially me!

840
01:32:32,665 --> 01:32:36,196
Why are you calling yourself as my father? You are not my father!

841
01:32:36,396 --> 01:32:38,072
Am I not your father? - No!

842
01:32:40,766 --> 01:32:44,298
If so, you are not my son! Hello my son!

843
01:32:46,963 --> 01:32:49,183
Bloody drunkard! Did not even let me speak to my father.

844
01:32:54,377 --> 01:32:56,461
We got to know that some outsiders are in this party.

845
01:32:56,661 --> 01:33:01,859
It is better if they go out by themselves, if not we will have to throw them out.

846
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:20,798
That means, they are having our drinks & also disturbing us!

847
01:33:24,811 --> 01:33:28,545
This is too much! Who is it? Is it you?

848
01:33:30,358 --> 01:33:31,508
Is it you?

849
01:33:35,517 --> 01:33:41,258
If there is some outsider here, it could be...

850
01:33:49,577 --> 01:33:53,748
None other than, myself!

851
01:33:56,521 --> 01:33:58,178
I am disturbed mentally, shall we go!

852
01:34:03,871 --> 01:34:07,935
Did you see how loud the heart beats? I would have got caught, if he was not there on time.

853
01:34:08,891 --> 01:34:11,849
Why do you hide Subbu? You can tell the truth to lovely!

854
01:34:12,049 --> 01:34:15,536
Will anything be left if I tell the truth?

855
01:34:17,943 --> 01:34:24,409
But if you keep hiding things, only the one who loses, will know the value of what is lost.

856
01:34:26,085 --> 01:34:27,622
You should not face such kind of situation.

857
01:34:27,822 --> 01:34:30,400
There is no doubt that lovely is deeply in love with me.

858
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:33,109
But I am thinking how would she receive this.

859
01:34:33,926 --> 01:34:36,824
Okay! I will tell her the truth as you are asking me to tell.

860
01:34:38,698 --> 01:34:40,302
Subbu! - What?

861
01:34:40,502 --> 01:34:43,365
I am going to the town day after tomorrow. - Which town?

862
01:34:43,565 --> 01:34:44,670
Town of my grandmother.

863
01:34:44,870 --> 01:34:46,031
When will you get back?

864
01:34:46,231 --> 01:34:49,504
I am not going to return, I am going to study there itself.

865
01:34:50,333 --> 01:34:54,146
You took a nice decision, If so, I would be in trouble.

866
01:34:55,281 --> 01:34:57,112
What is the trouble if I will not be there?

867
01:34:57,974 --> 01:35:00,750
Chakri would help me with the money. But the car?

868
01:35:01,171 --> 01:35:05,090
Jaanu! Jaanu! Please tell your father to give me the car whenever I need.

869
01:35:06,223 --> 01:35:07,147
Okay!

870
01:35:08,979 --> 01:35:15,331
I did not introduce you to Lovely right, we both will come together to give you a send-off, bye!

871
01:35:39,236 --> 01:35:44,217
Hey Subhash! Generally lovers roam around parks & beaches

872
01:35:45,325 --> 01:35:49,075
But why did you get me here?

873
01:35:50,702 --> 01:35:53,946
To tell you the truth! - The truth? About what?

874
01:35:57,039 --> 01:36:03,337
I am not an engineering college student as you think, I am a Government college student.

875
01:36:08,067 --> 01:36:14,161
Not just that, I am not a millionaire is son, I am a simple man.

876
01:36:16,109 --> 01:36:17,915
I am a canteen owner is son!

877
01:36:20,270 --> 01:36:24,870
Lovely! I did not do all this to cheat you , I love you sincerely.

878
01:36:26,858 --> 01:36:32,318
I was afraid that you would not be with me, so I did all this.

879
01:36:33,674 --> 01:36:36,536
But I love you Lovely! Really I love you!

880
01:36:41,048 --> 01:36:51,228
Mad Subha! You thought I would get angry & leave you?

881
01:36:54,517 --> 01:36:58,851
I will just kill you! I will kill you!

882
01:37:08,917 --> 01:37:12,991
I got scared that you screamed all of sudden!

883
01:37:13,191 --> 01:37:19,424
Bad dream! - What? Did you dream a flight crash while going to a business trip?

884
01:37:20,454 --> 01:37:21,764
Almost like that!

885
01:37:22,865 --> 01:37:29,082
By the way Subha, What did you feel when you saw me for the first time?

886
01:37:29,282 --> 01:37:30,772
What is your first feeling?

887
01:38:06,905 --> 01:38:09,860
Oh gracious lovely walk

888
01:38:11,794 --> 01:38:15,582
Why are you in such hurry?

889
01:38:18,372 --> 01:38:20,896
Oh sweetheart amidst everyone

890
01:38:22,086 --> 01:38:26,790
Do not raise my heart beat

891
01:39:13,698 --> 01:39:15,683
Hey girl, your name is lovely

892
01:39:16,281 --> 01:39:18,421
Do not slide like a fish

893
01:39:18,837 --> 01:39:21,081
You look like a guava

894
01:39:21,555 --> 01:39:23,680
Please do not tempt me

895
01:39:45,975 --> 01:39:48,211
Have tried so many ways

896
01:39:48,424 --> 01:39:50,591
Oh lady does not bother

897
01:39:51,193 --> 01:39:55,490
I have tried many tricks for you, she does not bother

898
01:39:56,466 --> 01:39:58,446
I greet her casually

899
01:39:58,816 --> 01:40:01,214
She does not reciprocate

900
01:40:01,942 --> 01:40:04,189
Flouting her waist

901
01:40:04,767 --> 01:40:06,396
Look at her attitude

902
01:40:08,790 --> 01:40:11,494
Talk to our boy

903
01:40:14,356 --> 01:40:16,986
Please follow this lovely boy

904
01:41:07,864 --> 01:41:09,915
What is that I should do?

905
01:41:10,364 --> 01:41:12,405
To make this girl mine

906
01:41:13,364 --> 01:41:16,285
This girl falls for me

907
01:41:18,717 --> 01:41:20,764
Hey friends please advise me

908
01:41:21,122 --> 01:41:23,284
Is there any short cut?

909
01:41:23,876 --> 01:41:26,011
What is that, this girl needs

910
01:41:26,499 --> 01:41:28,711
How long should I wait

911
01:41:39,857 --> 01:41:42,047
Is it the height?

912
01:41:42,367 --> 01:41:44,085
But I am taller than her

913
01:41:45,093 --> 01:41:47,695
Does she knows about my status

914
01:41:48,147 --> 01:41:49,517
Kindly let her know

915
01:41:50,439 --> 01:41:52,978
If she smiles a bit

916
01:41:53,394 --> 01:41:55,033
She loves her wealth

917
01:41:55,879 --> 01:42:00,463
Is she looks at this youngster she will not lose her charm

918
01:42:02,734 --> 01:42:05,142
Please look at him once

919
01:42:08,454 --> 01:42:10,982
Please do not leave saying no

920
01:42:13,796 --> 01:42:16,322
Let him come closer to you

921
01:42:19,661 --> 01:42:21,814
Come on love him

922
01:42:24,779 --> 01:42:27,212
Come on love him

923
01:42:30,002 --> 01:42:32,315
Come on love him

924
01:42:35,667 --> 01:42:37,988
Come on love him

925
01:42:41,104 --> 01:42:44,918
Common Chakri fast! Chakri! Common! Common!

926
01:42:53,369 --> 01:42:55,259
Why are you getting so upset?

927
01:42:55,883 --> 01:42:58,700
Are you not able to practice with concentration?

928
01:43:00,119 --> 01:43:03,966
Chakri! You do not have to feel depressed for losing once.

929
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:11,643
To be a winner, you must utilize your failures as stepping stones to success.

930
01:43:12,703 --> 01:43:16,433
If not, handover the canteen to Subbu & try practicing full time.

931
01:43:16,861 --> 01:43:21,062
What! If I do so he would change the shape of the canteen entirely within a day.

932
01:43:21,684 --> 01:43:23,569
That is why, I will handle it by myself.

933
01:43:24,870 --> 01:43:29,217
Hey Rohit! Advance bidding for Inter-college Kick boxing championship.

934
01:43:29,910 --> 01:43:32,067
Hey! Do you know who the opponent is?

935
01:43:32,358 --> 01:43:35,280
It is the kid Chakri who lost to him last year.

936
01:43:38,450 --> 01:43:43,888
Hey I bet you, that he will remove his hand or leg definitely.

937
01:43:45,585 --> 01:43:47,097
He will finish him.

938
01:43:48,997 --> 01:43:51,377
Hey! Rohit's mood is on Lovely & not on the match.

939
01:43:51,455 --> 01:43:52,499
Its on lovely.

940
01:43:53,465 --> 01:43:54,535
Hey! Look there!

941
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:03,726
How come you are laughing while he is taking your candidate?

942
01:44:03,926 --> 01:44:08,172
I was wondering on how is he trapping Lovely, now I get it.

943
01:44:13,218 --> 01:44:15,084
Hi Subha! It is you!

944
01:44:17,288 --> 01:44:19,207
How come you in Subhash is car?

945
01:44:19,407 --> 01:44:23,030
I am here to tell you how Subhash is roaming in my car!

946
01:44:35,241 --> 01:44:35,879
Janaki!

947
01:44:38,556 --> 01:44:39,339
What daddy?

948
01:44:39,539 --> 01:44:41,861
I need to buy some spare parts urgently, & I am in short of 10000 Rs,

949
01:44:42,061 --> 01:44:44,750
The money which I gave on your birthday to buy bangles,

950
01:44:44,950 --> 01:44:47,225
If you give me that, I will return it to you in 2 days with interest.

951
01:44:49,350 --> 01:44:50,694
That... - What?

952
01:44:51,993 --> 01:44:54,031
I spent that money Daddy.

953
01:44:54,231 --> 01:44:59,689
What! You do not even spend 50 or 100 Rs, how come you spent 10000 Rs?

954
01:44:59,889 --> 01:45:04,335
That..., my friend Laxmi was in urgent need, so...

955
01:45:04,535 --> 01:45:05,988
Did you also learn to lie?

956
01:45:06,188 --> 01:45:07,585
You gave it to that Subramanyam right?

957
01:45:07,785 --> 01:45:09,894
To hide that, you are making stories that you gave it to Laxmi.

958
01:45:10,835 --> 01:45:12,958
I gave it to Subbu, but, but... - Shut up!

959
01:45:13,158 --> 01:45:16,586
I remained silent while he used to take 50 or 100,

960
01:45:16,786 --> 01:45:19,550
But now, he came to a stage to fool girls & take 10000 Rs,

961
01:45:19,750 --> 01:45:22,484
If we still remain silent, he will mortgage this house someday!

962
01:45:22,684 --> 01:45:25,030
I will ask, I will go ask his father!

963
01:45:25,230 --> 01:45:28,024
Daddy, do not daddy, uncle will not keep quiet if he gets to know.

964
01:45:28,224 --> 01:45:30,260
Do you think I will be silent? You just shut up!

965
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:32,816
Daddy please! - Hey! You shut up!

966
01:45:33,016 --> 01:45:37,015
Hey Vishwanatham! Hey Vishwanatham! Come out once.

967
01:45:37,215 --> 01:45:40,790
What happened? - Do you want us to live here or not?

968
01:45:40,990 --> 01:45:42,763
Where is your younger son? - But what happened?

969
01:45:42,963 --> 01:45:46,070
This mad girl gave money to Subbu, thought would give him some more if it is not enough

970
01:45:46,270 --> 01:45:48,507
Daddy! - You shut up! Will hit you if you try to defend him.

971
01:45:48,707 --> 01:45:51,017
He cheated & took 10,000 Rs. - 10,000 Rs?

972
01:45:52,622 --> 01:45:53,716
But why did he require it?

973
01:45:53,916 --> 01:45:57,171
Not just thousands, lakhs are also not enough to the one who just roams

974
01:45:57,371 --> 01:45:59,388
You better control him. - I will speak to him.

975
01:45:59,588 --> 01:46:02,016
What will you speak? It is actually your mistake & not his.

976
01:46:02,216 --> 01:46:04,101
It is not enough to have kids, you must also grow them better.

977
01:46:04,301 --> 01:46:06,739
You must notice what all is he doing!

978
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:20,871
Where is he?

979
01:46:23,817 --> 01:46:27,760
Hey girl! Will you not speak?

980
01:46:29,769 --> 01:46:34,070
Hey girl! Girl! Hey girl! Girl!

981
01:46:35,744 --> 01:46:39,694
Hey girl! Will you not speak?

982
01:46:39,894 --> 01:46:44,447
Hey girl! Girl! Hey girl! Girl!

983
01:46:46,175 --> 01:46:52,581
Hey girl! Will you not speak? Hey girl! Girl! Will you not speak?

984
01:46:52,781 --> 01:46:56,481
I will give 5 rs, buy flowers & keep it in your head!

985
01:46:56,681 --> 01:46:59,495
I will give 5 Rs, hey! Hey! Hey!

986
01:46:59,965 --> 01:47:02,821
I will give 5 Rs, buy flowers & keep it in your head!

987
01:47:03,021 --> 01:47:11,470
Hey girl! Hey girl! Will you not speak? Hey girl! Girl! Will you not speak?

988
01:47:12,144 --> 01:47:13,659
If you say yes! Hey! Hey! Hey!

989
01:47:15,356 --> 01:47:18,488
If you say yes! Hey! Hey! Hey!

990
01:47:18,688 --> 01:47:22,115
If you say yes, I will give my heart to you.

991
01:47:22,315 --> 01:47:32,046
Hey girl! Hey girl! Will you not speak? Hey girl! Girl! Will you not speak?

992
01:48:11,370 --> 01:48:18,856
How come Multi-millionaire Pramod Kumar's son Subhash is here?

993
01:48:20,356 --> 01:48:22,362
Oh! For time pass, is it?

994
01:48:22,562 --> 01:48:26,285
Lovely you! With factory workers, I am just...

995
01:48:26,485 --> 01:48:28,922
Shut up! - How more will you lie?

996
01:48:29,534 --> 01:48:34,125
You are a rascal of Government college & lied that you are an engineering student.

997
01:48:34,951 --> 01:48:44,169
You do not have a cycle & lied about cars, buildings, foreign trips & you cheated me in the name of love.

998
01:48:45,908 --> 01:48:52,586
It is true that I acted as a millionaire, but I did not tell you the truth as I was afraid that you would leave me.

999
01:48:53,567 --> 01:48:55,043
But my love is true!

1000
01:48:55,243 --> 01:49:00,917
But why should I love you? Are you a merit student or a sports champion?

1001
01:49:06,593 --> 01:49:08,370
What! What is happening here?

1002
01:49:08,570 --> 01:49:12,365
Dad that... - Oh! So you are Vishwanatham!

1003
01:49:12,565 --> 01:49:16,090
You have trained him nicely to trap a rich girl!

1004
01:49:17,039 --> 01:49:18,702
Speak with respect!

1005
01:49:18,902 --> 01:49:25,885
Respect! Being a canteen owner is son, your son told that he is a millionaire is son.

1006
01:49:26,085 --> 01:49:28,290
What respect should I give to such people?

1007
01:49:30,242 --> 01:49:36,083
Lovely, I will explain it to you. - What? That this is a drama & he is also not your father?

1008
01:49:39,429 --> 01:49:43,291
We will lose our status if we speak to such people. Come let us go!

1009
01:49:46,531 --> 01:49:47,881
Daddy! Lovely did not knew...

1010
01:49:54,198 --> 01:49:57,911
You got my head down by taking 10,000 Rs from Janaki.

1011
01:49:58,539 --> 01:50:02,619
And here, you cheated that girl & insulted us on the roads.

1012
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:06,075
Do not show me your face, get out!

1013
01:50:46,129 --> 01:50:47,741
What? Should I tell you specially?

1014
01:50:47,941 --> 01:50:50,477
I am not like them.

1015
01:50:50,677 --> 01:50:53,338
Is it? Is this your father is park then?

1016
01:50:54,554 --> 01:51:00,058
Jeans pant! T-shirt! Are you a thief? Must be a hustler!

1017
01:51:00,412 --> 01:51:02,923
Nothing as such! - Hey just leave! Go!

1018
01:51:03,123 --> 01:51:07,230
Hey leave! Just go! Go from here! Go!

1019
01:51:17,371 --> 01:51:21,924
What Subbu? You forgot about us if uncle threw you out of the house.

1020
01:51:22,124 --> 01:51:23,913
That you are roaming around parks.

1021
01:51:25,909 --> 01:51:26,629
Come let us go!

1022
01:51:31,868 --> 01:51:34,039
Common let us go! - Only you come inside!

1023
01:51:41,859 --> 01:51:44,784
Subbu! His father threw him out & you got him here!

1024
01:51:46,836 --> 01:51:49,740
His father just threw him out for what he did. Whereas, I would have killed him.

1025
01:51:52,930 --> 01:51:57,951
As you were not seen, I thought you went to your friend’s place. But you went near him!

1026
01:51:58,151 --> 01:52:02,478
Your train must have left. If you have no shame to bring him here, at least he should have had to not come here.

1027
01:52:02,678 --> 01:52:04,683
Daddy please! Subbu!

1028
01:52:07,695 --> 01:52:10,022
He left! Common, I will send you in some other train.

1029
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:20,499
Daddy! I have told you that I will go, but now I cannot go leaving Subbu in this condition.

1030
01:52:22,694 --> 01:52:26,515
So, where will you go now? - I can take you to my place, but my people...

1031
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:29,877
It is okay, you may go!

1032
01:52:30,077 --> 01:52:31,613
Where will you stay then?

1033
01:52:41,958 --> 01:52:42,473
Subbu!

1034
01:52:47,361 --> 01:52:49,356
Here! Have this!

1035
01:52:50,808 --> 01:52:54,609
I am not hungry! - I know that you cannot control hunger.

1036
01:52:59,341 --> 01:53:02,455
Subbu! My father should not have spoken like that.

1037
01:53:03,136 --> 01:53:07,440
It is okay! - If you do not mind, shall I say something?

1038
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:09,847
What? - Actually, It is your mistake!

1039
01:53:11,396 --> 01:53:14,168
You know that, what you are doing is wrong.

1040
01:53:14,368 --> 01:53:16,614
And still you continue doing it.

1041
01:53:17,899 --> 01:53:21,447
Anyone would react the same way as my father did.

1042
01:53:22,574 --> 01:53:28,254
You walked off with attitude, but did not feel like apologising him for what you did?

1043
01:53:30,624 --> 01:53:35,398
Chakri helps him a lot, & you made him loose his respect in front of all.

1044
01:53:36,466 --> 01:53:40,547
It is useful to you & not to him, if you listen to him & study well.

1045
01:53:40,747 --> 01:53:44,656
And if you become great, it is your benefit & not his.

1046
01:53:46,134 --> 01:53:49,974
What will you achieve if you roam around with anger?

1047
01:53:53,463 --> 01:53:57,415
Look how disgusting is your situation the moment you are separated from your father

1048
01:53:59,714 --> 01:54:07,722
At least now, listen to your father & make him proud in front of all.

1049
01:54:09,399 --> 01:54:11,700
I am telling you this as you would respect what I say.

1050
01:54:16,385 --> 01:54:18,516
Please change your habits Subbu!

1051
01:54:34,487 --> 01:54:40,230
Hello Sir! - Subhash! It is you, how come you are here? There are no college girls too.

1052
01:54:40,430 --> 01:54:49,245
I thought of carrying the items. - Oh! They are already packed, the kid will be here 10 min, I will send it across.

1053
01:54:49,445 --> 01:54:52,275
From now I will take it, the kid is not required.

1054
01:54:52,416 --> 01:54:55,481
Oh! From now on you like to grab on this money as well?

1055
01:54:55,681 --> 01:55:00,438
No! I would like to help him at least in this manner.

1056
01:55:00,638 --> 01:55:01,785
It is okay, you may take it.

1057
01:55:12,366 --> 01:55:14,037
Greetings Sir! - The guy who is taking the items...

1058
01:55:14,237 --> 01:55:19,922
It is Subhash Sir, Vishwanatham’s son, as the kid is not here, he is taking his canteen is items by himself.

1059
01:55:20,122 --> 01:55:24,606
You fool! He is a hustler, his father threw him out from the canteen yesterday itself.

1060
01:55:24,806 --> 01:55:28,536
He will sell all this to another store & enjoy with the money. Go & catch him.

1061
01:55:29,076 --> 01:55:31,739
Subhash! Hey Subhash! Stop right there!

1062
01:55:31,939 --> 01:55:33,608
Give the items first. - Why? What happened?

1063
01:55:43,174 --> 01:55:51,970
What is that power? I am going crazy by holding this. Probably Rohit might go mad in the battle.

1064
01:55:52,170 --> 01:55:57,055
Chakri! Oh! You are practising! Look what I bought for you.

1065
01:56:01,027 --> 01:56:02,663
Head guard & knee pads.

1066
01:56:05,591 --> 01:56:10,764
I bought it for you from Mr Chandrasekhar as he was going to Delhi.

1067
01:56:10,964 --> 01:56:12,455
Why all this now?

1068
01:56:12,655 --> 01:56:16,909
I know what sportsman spirit is. New things always encourages.

1069
01:56:17,647 --> 01:56:22,460
What else do I need if you grow from state level to national level.

1070
01:56:23,505 --> 01:56:28,926
My son will fulfil my ambition! - Definitely Daddy! I will win this match.

1071
01:56:30,010 --> 01:56:32,902
Not for me, you will win it at least for Shanti.

1072
01:56:33,102 --> 01:56:35,965
Shanti! Shanti! Ah!

1073
01:56:38,358 --> 01:56:39,875
I know about you both.

1074
01:56:40,075 --> 01:56:43,042
But what you do not know is, that I and her father spoke to each other.

1075
01:56:43,735 --> 01:56:47,019
Day after tomorrow is your engagement. - That means elders have agreed to the marriage.

1076
01:56:47,219 --> 01:56:49,033
That is true! Also the phone rang!

1077
01:56:49,233 --> 01:56:52,659
It is marriage time! - Hello! Yes it is me!

1078
01:57:00,677 --> 01:57:03,029
That idiot will not let me live. - Who daddy?

1079
01:57:03,229 --> 01:57:07,591
Your brother! He tried to hustle the items from the super market!

1080
01:57:07,791 --> 01:57:14,094
Owner Sridhar caught him meanwhile, he says would have hand him over to the police if he was not my son

1081
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,950
Chakri! Trust me I did not go to hustle the items.

1082
01:57:29,588 --> 01:57:36,150
I have made him loose his respect on the roads!

1083
01:57:37,243 --> 01:57:48,012
I have realized now! I was scared to face him, so I thought of impressing him by doing some canteen is work.

1084
01:57:48,686 --> 01:57:53,261
But they... - You are always like this kid. Always going in the wrong root.

1085
01:57:53,461 --> 01:57:58,297
You should have fell on his feet, if you really wanted him to forgive you. Why did you try doing this?

1086
01:57:58,530 --> 01:58:00,289
He is getting hot as fire by taking your name.

1087
01:58:00,489 --> 01:58:04,258
Now what shall I do? - I would have given you a brilliant idea if you would have asked me before.

1088
01:58:04,458 --> 01:58:07,646
You do not get tensed, there is a way to reduce his anger.

1089
01:58:07,846 --> 01:58:11,123
What is it? - Day after tomorrow, me & Shanti are getting engaged.

1090
01:58:11,323 --> 01:58:12,897
You & Shanti are getting engaged!

1091
01:58:13,650 --> 01:58:17,658
Shanti is my Sister-in-law then, hey congrats dear!

1092
01:58:19,645 --> 01:58:23,254
I will try to convince him in that function. - You do not worry kid.

1093
01:58:23,461 --> 01:58:25,217
Look Brotherhood!

1094
01:58:26,073 --> 01:58:32,004
Hey look! Thought of 5 star hotel getting Lovely. But look, he is not deserving a footpath too.

1095
01:58:32,770 --> 01:58:34,198
What Subbu!

1096
01:58:34,995 --> 01:58:40,327
Hey! Anyhow you know to clean cups. Try to get some job in a cheap hotel!

1097
01:58:41,187 --> 01:58:44,074
If not, being low-class dreaming for a high-class.

1098
01:58:44,806 --> 01:58:49,197
Look! Happened has happened! He is no more behind that girl now.

1099
01:58:50,168 --> 01:58:51,008
You do not poke him unnecessarily!

1100
01:58:51,208 --> 01:58:54,516
The elder one got angry if we poke the younger one.

1101
01:58:55,337 --> 01:58:59,233
His arrogance did not reduce even after losing to Rohit!

1102
01:58:59,433 --> 01:59:04,000
Do not show your talent here, it in the boxing ring! Understood?

1103
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:06,934
Please, do not attempt to fight.

1104
01:59:07,134 --> 01:59:11,080
Hey! What will you do? Will you hit? Hit me!

1105
02:00:40,521 --> 02:00:45,107
The joy has just started

1106
02:00:45,786 --> 02:00:51,068
Happiness has stood in front of us

1107
02:00:52,205 --> 02:01:01,155
The wedding has fixed, the house has enlightened

1108
02:02:13,372 --> 02:02:23,111
It is like a blessing, which comes from mother

1109
02:02:23,943 --> 02:02:34,509
I will always take care of you

1110
02:02:35,241 --> 02:02:39,663
I will mot trouble you

1111
02:03:34,996 --> 02:03:44,410
You have to enlighten the house like a daughter

1112
02:03:45,566 --> 02:03:50,100
Everyone has to bless the couple in the marriage

1113
02:03:50,843 --> 02:03:55,410
The knot has to be auspicious

1114
02:03:56,845 --> 02:04:01,538
The moonlight will be the witness

1115
02:04:38,246 --> 02:04:41,996
Hey Subhash! Hurry up! If not we might get delayed.

1116
02:04:43,704 --> 02:04:46,182
Then.., Chakri's engagement?

1117
02:04:46,382 --> 02:04:50,518
Engagement is tomorrow! He is dreaming as it already happened.

1118
02:04:52,689 --> 02:04:59,676
Why did you hit me? - He is already in pain, you do not worry Chakri will definitely convince your father.

1119
02:05:04,177 --> 02:05:05,791
How will I alone manage all the work?

1120
02:05:06,108 --> 02:05:11,629
Canteen work, house work, outside work, now this engagement work!

1121
02:05:11,829 --> 02:05:13,795
Malli! What is your problem?

1122
02:05:14,441 --> 02:05:19,154
I have two hands & not hundred. It is better if a human helps another human!

1123
02:05:20,084 --> 02:05:21,754
Tell me what help do you want? I will do it.

1124
02:05:21,954 --> 02:05:25,654
Now we have to tie mango leaves to the doors, will you climb the tree or me?

1125
02:05:25,854 --> 02:05:28,979
If Subbu is here, he would fill the entire house with mango leaves.

1126
02:05:29,179 --> 02:05:30,753
I already told you not to take his name!

1127
02:05:30,953 --> 02:05:35,155
Actually daddy, this is our first big occasion, it will be good if he is also here.

1128
02:05:35,629 --> 02:05:39,182
He realized! From now on he will be good, I will guarantee it.

1129
02:05:39,382 --> 02:05:41,510
Please do not say no daddy! I will go get him right away!

1130
02:05:41,710 --> 02:05:47,636
Chakri! Listen to me! - Please daddy, I will go get him right now. - Hey Chakri! Hey Chakri!

1131
02:05:47,836 --> 02:05:50,017
Do not look back, he is telling to get him back quickly.

1132
02:05:51,029 --> 02:05:52,642
I think the curry is on fire!

1133
02:06:10,968 --> 02:06:17,891
What Chakri! There is time for the match, if you are to fight, fight with me & not with my friends.

1134
02:06:18,091 --> 02:06:22,668
Look! They have insulted my brother, that is why I taught them a lesson.

1135
02:06:23,300 --> 02:06:24,979
Do not make this an issue unnecessarily.

1136
02:06:25,179 --> 02:06:26,144
What issue?

1137
02:07:49,271 --> 02:07:51,236
Sister! Check the blood pressure!

1138
02:07:55,590 --> 02:08:02,760
His life is not in danger, but he might take 2 to 3 months to get up as his spinal cord is injured severely.

1139
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:08,210
I am also not sure about it. I know how many dreams you have on him. But I am sorry!

1140
02:08:28,019 --> 02:08:31,361
Why did you come? To see how we are?

1141
02:08:32,558 --> 02:08:34,624
Have a look at that girl!

1142
02:08:35,541 --> 02:08:37,474
They should have been engaged by now!

1143
02:08:38,127 --> 02:08:41,341
He always talks about you in every matter.

1144
02:08:41,831 --> 02:08:45,910
He wanted you to attend his engagement even if I did not agree to it.

1145
02:08:47,577 --> 02:08:48,685
And now...

1146
02:08:48,885 --> 02:08:52,475
Hey! Did you at least do one good thing till now?

1147
02:08:53,080 --> 02:08:55,255
- I will join my hands! - Daddy that... - No!

1148
02:08:55,894 --> 02:08:58,694
You are not my son, I have only one son.

1149
02:08:59,323 --> 02:09:03,890
Go! Go & die somewhere! Get out!

1150
02:10:31,792 --> 02:10:33,076
Do not worry Subbu!

1151
02:10:35,817 --> 02:10:38,481
Look Jaanu! What daddy is saying!

1152
02:10:39,446 --> 02:10:43,060
That I am the reason for Chakri’s situation.

1153
02:10:43,260 --> 02:10:52,367
No one used to say anything when I used to just roam. But now, they say I am the cause for everything!

1154
02:10:56,596 --> 02:11:06,091
Calm down Subbu! Your dad has dreamt that he would rise his name with lots of respect.

1155
02:11:06,291 --> 02:11:08,856
He could not handle himself after what happened to Chakri!

1156
02:11:10,233 --> 02:11:11,254
He must have said that as he is worried.

1157
02:11:11,454 --> 02:11:16,831
Do not mind for what he said, try to understand & get close to him.

1158
02:11:27,287 --> 02:11:29,117
How is Chakri now? Is he conscious now?

1159
02:11:29,778 --> 02:11:34,841
Not yet daddy! I am worried by looking at Vishwanatham Uncle.

1160
02:11:35,886 --> 02:11:39,074
I could not see him with tears.

1161
02:11:41,771 --> 02:11:44,528
Subbu's situation is even worse.

1162
02:11:44,728 --> 02:11:47,850
It is okay if you go there for the sake of Chakri or Vishwanatham

1163
02:11:48,662 --> 02:11:50,156
But you should not meet Subbu from now on!

1164
02:11:50,356 --> 02:11:51,424
What are you saying Daddy?

1165
02:11:51,624 --> 02:11:55,234
Are you asking me what? I am just telling you what you have hidden !

1166
02:12:01,666 --> 02:12:03,629
Did you get that idiot only to fall in love with?

1167
02:12:04,611 --> 02:12:05,705
But, what did you see in him to love him?

1168
02:12:06,986 --> 02:12:10,889
He is with you since childhood, took money from you & spent it on someone else

1169
02:12:11,327 --> 02:12:14,236
Are you not pissed of him still? That you are still writing non-sense about him.

1170
02:12:26,384 --> 02:12:31,953
Daddy! I loved Subbu! And not telling him is my mistake.

1171
02:12:33,045 --> 02:12:38,328
He may love whomever he wants to, but Subbu will always be in my heart.

1172
02:13:00,315 --> 02:13:02,040
There is improvement!

1173
02:13:04,601 --> 02:13:09,687
But I do not think the wounds are caused just by accident.

1174
02:13:09,887 --> 02:13:13,040
No Doctor, it is accident, I myself went into the wrong route.

1175
02:13:13,240 --> 02:13:15,605
No problem! You get alright within next three months.

1176
02:13:15,805 --> 02:13:20,410
The match is near, that means, Will I not be able to participate?

1177
02:13:25,623 --> 02:13:27,634
Daddy! Why did not he respond?

1178
02:13:27,834 --> 02:13:30,837
Chakri! Why all that now?

1179
02:13:31,037 --> 02:13:34,431
We expect a lot to happen in life, but will that all happen?

1180
02:13:35,793 --> 02:13:41,258
Daddy! - I know that you will win, but it happened this way!

1181
02:13:42,774 --> 02:13:45,071
Think you have lost without participating.

1182
02:13:48,443 --> 02:13:51,026
No Daddy! I have to attend the match at any cost.

1183
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:53,199
And fulfil your dreams.

1184
02:13:55,445 --> 02:13:58,517
I know how hard you worked to make me a champion!

1185
02:13:59,411 --> 02:14:04,444
I also know how proudly you used to say that I will win the match.

1186
02:14:05,281 --> 02:14:07,123
At least for that, I will...

1187
02:14:07,323 --> 02:14:09,908
But now, I do not have any aim or dream.

1188
02:14:10,383 --> 02:14:12,064
You are here alive, that is enough!

1189
02:14:13,909 --> 02:14:17,823
We clean cups in the canteen, why do we need a cup?

1190
02:14:19,977 --> 02:14:21,066
You better forget about it.

1191
02:14:23,419 --> 02:14:28,723
If so, it is not necessary to buy boxing gloves or head guard for me!

1192
02:14:28,923 --> 02:14:32,350
Just buy one wheel chair for me. - Chakri!

1193
02:14:32,550 --> 02:14:39,177
Yes Daddy! - What will I achieve now? You have dreamed a lot to see me as a boxer.

1194
02:14:39,976 --> 02:14:43,311
Sorry Daddy! I am not able to fulfil your dreams!

1195
02:14:46,286 --> 02:14:48,895
Chakri! - Sorry Daddy! I am not able to fulfil your dreams!

1196
02:14:56,251 --> 02:15:00,388
You have dreamed a lot to see me as a boxer. Sorry Daddy!

1197
02:15:00,588 --> 02:15:03,237
I am not able to fulfil your dreams!

1198
02:15:04,315 --> 02:15:08,036
We clean cups in the canteen, why do we need a cup?

1199
02:15:26,315 --> 02:15:27,267
What Subhash you are here?

1200
02:15:27,768 --> 02:15:30,037
How is Chakri? - He is okay Sir.

1201
02:15:35,310 --> 02:15:36,701
Anything else to speak?

1202
02:15:39,928 --> 02:15:44,248
I want to participate instead of Chakri in this year is Kick boxing championship!

1203
02:15:45,884 --> 02:15:50,296
If you start to train me, I will give my name in the college.

1204
02:15:54,221 --> 02:15:56,303
I will learn sincerely, Please!

1205
02:15:56,503 --> 02:15:59,625
Look Subhash! I can understand your pain!

1206
02:16:01,001 --> 02:16:04,818
You may have taken this decision by looking at Chakri is Situation.

1207
02:16:06,346 --> 02:16:12,321
But to learn Kick boxing, One should practise sincerely for years.

1208
02:16:12,521 --> 02:16:17,474
I will be sincere. - You who roams behind girls without any responsibility will never get it!

1209
02:16:18,598 --> 02:16:20,554
I will only teach to the sincere ones.

1210
02:16:21,244 --> 02:16:23,176
Not to people like you! You may go.

1211
02:16:24,415 --> 02:16:33,131
Sir! - Deciding will not work! Your life will be at risk if you participate without proper preparation.

1212
02:17:22,229 --> 02:17:24,645
Subbu! You are very stubborn.

1213
02:17:26,082 --> 02:17:26,716
Come!

1214
02:18:06,170 --> 02:18:07,100
Subbu!

1215
02:18:09,818 --> 02:18:10,713
What Sister, you are here?

1216
02:18:10,913 --> 02:18:13,022
I want to speak to you in personal.

1217
02:18:19,187 --> 02:18:22,269
Say sister! - What do you think about Janaki?

1218
02:18:23,450 --> 02:18:27,684
Janaki? She always helped me since childhood.

1219
02:18:27,866 --> 02:18:30,239
She is a great friend, who would also give her life for my sake!

1220
02:18:30,728 --> 02:18:34,196
Being a girl, I am saying this as I understand her heart.

1221
02:18:34,396 --> 02:18:38,776
You are not just a friend to her. You mean everything to her!

1222
02:18:44,334 --> 02:18:47,742
Yes! Janaki loves you since she knows you.

1223
02:19:00,009 --> 02:19:02,764
Lovely choose the Subhash with status, cars & bungalows

1224
02:19:02,964 --> 02:19:06,354
But, it is status for Janaki only if you are beside her.

1225
02:19:06,554 --> 02:19:10,288
She tried to go away from you, after knowing that you love Lovely.

1226
02:19:10,488 --> 02:19:13,655
But she could not leave you in this situation.

1227
02:19:16,754 --> 02:19:24,818
It is true Subbu! As she can't go against her dad, is suffering every moment as she cannot live without seeing you.

1228
02:19:26,695 --> 02:19:29,261
It is always better to be loved by someone, than loving someone.

1229
02:19:29,461 --> 02:19:31,008
Think it over Subbu!

1230
02:19:37,087 --> 02:19:41,565
Dear Janaki, you are very lucky, the boy agreed by seeing your photo.

1231
02:19:41,765 --> 02:19:45,341
It is a great match, he is a software engineer in America, earns 2 lakhs per month.

1232
02:19:45,882 --> 02:19:50,460
As he has not got leaves, he wants to confirm this match on the coming 10th!

1233
02:19:50,660 --> 02:19:52,891
What do you say? Are you listening?

1234
02:19:54,102 --> 02:19:55,426
I am telling it to you!

1235
02:19:56,110 --> 02:19:59,807
I also told you long back, Only Subbu will be in my heart forever!

1236
02:20:00,879 --> 02:20:04,402
If you still continue to do all this, You may lose your daughter!

1237
02:20:08,311 --> 02:20:09,281
Uncle! How come you are here!

1238
02:20:09,481 --> 02:20:12,504
I am here to ask about you, as you are my would be son-in-law.

1239
02:20:13,532 --> 02:20:18,608
Yes! Subbu is my life! I do not mind him loving someone else But I will always love him, this is what she says!

1240
02:20:19,925 --> 02:20:26,619
Hey! You tell me, will any father agree to give her daughter to an idiot & a vagabond like you?

1241
02:20:29,724 --> 02:20:30,797
Tell, will any father agree?

1242
02:20:31,476 --> 02:20:32,648
No, will not agree!

1243
02:20:32,848 --> 02:20:37,353
You cannot even feed her one time, & will any father agree?

1244
02:20:40,068 --> 02:20:41,295
Never!

1245
02:20:41,495 --> 02:20:44,374
Hey! Janaki always lived for your sake since childhood

1246
02:20:44,574 --> 02:20:47,386
If you want her happiness, tell her to accept to marry to the America guy

1247
02:20:47,586 --> 02:20:51,067
Only you can convince her. She will only listen to you!

1248
02:20:53,278 --> 02:20:56,755
Subbu! Are you also asking me to accept this match!

1249
02:20:57,576 --> 02:21:00,609
If not, is the groom a vagabond like me?

1250
02:21:01,821 --> 02:21:06,017
He is a nice guy it seems! Elders always say for our betterment.

1251
02:21:06,217 --> 02:21:09,475
It is you who told me, that it is better if we listen to them.

1252
02:21:11,544 --> 02:21:15,019
If you have any respect to my words, please agree to it Jaanu!

1253
02:21:22,411 --> 02:21:27,648
Okay Subbu! I always wanted you to be the champion.

1254
02:21:28,994 --> 02:21:34,835
I want to see you winning the cup & become a champion, then I will leave.

1255
02:26:29,212 --> 02:26:30,190
How are you?

1256
02:26:37,633 --> 02:26:45,213
What! As you are not participating, you are training your brother & sending him

1257
02:26:48,047 --> 02:26:48,777
My brother?

1258
02:26:50,405 --> 02:26:54,398
You could not withstand my punch power, how come that kid Subbu will?

1259
02:26:55,983 --> 02:26:58,827
Keep a bed ready beside you for his sake!

1260
02:27:00,174 --> 02:27:03,000
You & your brother can rest together!

1261
02:27:03,200 --> 02:27:08,340
I have done this to you, for just touching my friends

1262
02:27:09,177 --> 02:27:15,262
He is trying to compete me, ask him to be careful with his life!

1263
02:27:27,724 --> 02:27:30,891
Why is he here? Why is he threatening to kill ?

1264
02:27:31,091 --> 02:27:34,556
Shanti! Ask Subbu to meet me urgently wherever he is. Why?

1265
02:27:34,756 --> 02:27:37,393
He is about to fight against Rohit. I have to stop him.

1266
02:27:37,593 --> 02:27:42,526
Our Subbu! If so, I think he is going to achieve what you wanted to!

1267
02:27:44,929 --> 02:27:47,653
You do not know about Rohit! He will do anything to win.

1268
02:27:47,853 --> 02:27:51,691
He is the one responsible for me being in this situation!

1269
02:27:58,732 --> 02:28:02,088
He made the accident on the day I was going to meet Subbu!

1270
02:28:04,775 --> 02:28:11,584
I hide this, as where Subbu will loose control on this & loose his life.

1271
02:28:11,784 --> 02:28:17,996
Shanti! At any cost I shall stop him from fighting!

1272
02:28:39,687 --> 02:28:41,382
Is everything there for tomorrow’s occasion? - Yes we have!

1273
02:28:41,582 --> 02:28:42,932
You should not repent tomorrow!

1274
02:28:43,132 --> 02:28:51,787
There cannot be anyone else than Subbu in my heart, But I know that he is never going to be mine.

1275
02:28:51,987 --> 02:28:56,504
And I cannot live with the person whom you want me to get married to.

1276
02:28:57,764 --> 02:29:00,211
There is only one solution to this, my death!

1277
02:33:02,888 --> 02:33:03,683
Subbu!

1278
02:33:08,156 --> 02:33:08,703
Dad!

1279
02:33:16,432 --> 02:33:16,920
Dad!

1280
02:33:27,166 --> 02:33:27,814
Subbu!

1281
02:33:51,474 --> 02:33:53,994
Dad! Ask him to stop!

1282
02:34:01,326 --> 02:34:02,127
Subbu!

1283
02:34:10,370 --> 02:34:19,894
Subbu! Stop it! I believe that you have changed into a good person. Yes really!

1284
02:34:22,554 --> 02:34:27,516
You do not risk your life for my sake, stop it!

1285
02:34:35,206 --> 02:34:38,564
Subbu! Listen to me, stop it, please!

1286
02:35:10,974 --> 02:35:11,846
Subbu!

1287
02:35:34,959 --> 02:35:36,189
Common Subbu!

1288
02:37:03,015 --> 02:37:03,873
Janaki!

1289
02:37:31,206 --> 02:37:32,166
Dear Janaki!

1290
02:37:36,772 --> 02:37:39,241
Chakri! This cup is yours!

1291
02:37:58,020 --> 02:37:59,423
Daddy!

1292
02:38:01,555 --> 02:38:02,457
Subhash!

1293
02:38:03,811 --> 02:38:05,183
I am your Subbu Daddy!

1294
02:38:16,337 --> 02:38:18,865
Subbu! Janaki!

1295
02:38:33,168 --> 02:38:33,656
Jaanu!

1296
02:38:36,223 --> 02:38:40,822
You want to make me lonely and leave this world all alone?

1297
02:38:43,415 --> 02:38:49,928
Please do forgive me for not Understanding you!

1298
02:38:53,860 --> 02:38:57,474
I truly love you Jaanu!
