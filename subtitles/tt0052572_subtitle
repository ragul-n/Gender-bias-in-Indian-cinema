1
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,396
Thank you, sir

2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,189
I wish you had stayed on
to take your degree

3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,994
I couldn't afford to

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,834
But don't give up your writing

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,999
I remember your stories in the
college magazine about village life

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,315
They were very good. You know,
one can earn a living by writing

19
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,269
Good morning. Sit down

20
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,394
What use will that be?

21
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,189
It will rest your legs

22
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,199
I haven't come up to rest my legs

23
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,554
You know very well why I'm here

24
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,277
I'm going to ask a straight question,

25
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,597
and I'd like a straight answer

26
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,190
- What is the date?
- The tenth

27
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,919
- How many months rent do you owe me?
- Three

28
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,515
That makes twenty-one rupees

29
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,315
Will you pay me now,
or shall I return this evening?

30
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,275
That makes three questions, not one

31
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,232
It's not fair

32
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,518
Many things are not fair

33
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,033
Is it fair
that I should house you for nothing?

34
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,429
That you should use electricity
all day without paying for it?

35
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,754
You have had education.

36
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,310
You have pictures
of great men on the wall

37
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,956
Is it fair
that you don't pay the rent?

38
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,437
It's a sign of greatness, you know

39
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,111
I, too, could turn a pretty phrase...

40
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,878
...but it would not be fit

41
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,675
for your young ears

42
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,114
Anyway, either I get my money
this evening...

43
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,598
...or I'll look for a new lodger

44
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,470
This letter is for you, not me

45
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,478
We're both Rays

46
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,509
We are pleased to accept your short
story "A Man of the Soil"...

47
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,395
...for publication in the next
<i>ssue of Sahityik</i>

48
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,074
Not bad news, I hope

49
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,109
Why do you get so few letters?

50
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,789
Does nobody write to you?

51
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,231
I'd like to open a love letter
by mistake

52
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,794
Perhaps it's as well

53
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,551
I've experienced
matrimonial complications

54
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,958
HARIMATI PRIMARY SCHOOL

55
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,949
You advertised for a teacher

56
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,069
Qualifications?

57
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,953
- Intermediate Science
- No good, we want Matriculation

58
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,234
But I got that before Intermediate

59
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,794
What did the advertisement say?

60
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,754
It did specify Matriculation

61
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,950
Then why harp on Intermediate?
What's the point?

62
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,596
Would you work
for ten rupees a month?

63
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,590
Well?

64
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,713
I understand
you want someone in your factory.

65
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,478
I have Matriculation

66
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,630
Any experience of labelling?

67
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,038
Labelling?
No, but I can learn

68
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,556
Go through that door
and down the passage.

69
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,071
Take a look first

70
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,153
Pulu!

71
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,228
You're a fine friend.

72
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,594
Why didn't you tell me
you'd left the student hostel?

73
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:42,798
I've been searching north Calcutta
for you since four o'clock

74
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,796
I finally got your address from the
people you give private lessons to

75
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,157
What's so funny?

76
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,158
You've put on weight

77
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,317
I had.
I lost it these last three hours

78
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,152
Would you like tea at the cafe
around the corner?

79
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,158
All right.

80
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,274
But I've two tickets for
us to see Sadhabar Ekadashi

81
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:16,153
Is this a hideout? Are you
forging banknotes or something?

82
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,398
I wish I could

83
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,194
And you cook for yourself?

84
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,149
I'll cook you a meal one day:
Rice and potatoes

85
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,430
What about the railway job?

86
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,709
I thought you'd got it

87
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,233
There was a strike on, and they
wanted people as strike-breakers

88
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,029
So you've been unemployed?

89
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,836
I give some private lessons

90
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,072
- How much do you make?
- Fifteen rupees a month

91
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,234
Didn't you learn to type?

92
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,358
Yes, I thought it might be useful

93
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,189
Good. I'll get you a job
as soon as we return

94
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,835
Where are we going?

95
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,832
You'll come with me to my cousin
Aparna's wedding on Monday

96
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,116
- Where?
- Just for a few days

97
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,789
- But where?
- Khulna.

98
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,275
Khulna!
It's a hundred miles away

99
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,474
You'll love it there

100
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,793
An old-world village,
a lovely river with boats on it

101
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,117
Fields of grass and paddy.

102
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,198
Bamboo groves, mango orchards

103
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,039
Doesn't it tempt you?

104
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,830
Trees full of birds:
Magpies, thrushes, nightingales

105
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,029
And in the evening,
fireflies and oil lamps aglow

106
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,673
No electricity

107
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,032
Doesn't it sound tempting?

108
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,031
You'll come, won't you?

109
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,070
Take me back to thy lap,
O Mother Earth

110
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,751
Take back thy son and wrap him
<i>n thine ample robe</i>

111
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,833
Let me be one with the soil,
and spread myself

112
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,634
Far and wide,
like the joys of spring,

113
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,593
let me burst the heart's narrow cage

114
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,829
reak down the stonewalls of self
and the cheerless prison of the mind

115
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,998
To rush forth in a rapture of delight

116
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,636
And flow to the far ends of the earth,

117
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,753
surging, billowing, rolling on

118
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,908
A policeman

119
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,519
Who's there?

120
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,837
<i>Am Mainaak,</i>
son of the Himalayas,

121
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,759
hiding my wings in the sea

122
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,318
What's come over you?

123
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,433
You sound
as if you've had too much to drink

124
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,350
I don't think I'll take that job

125
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,073
Don't be absurd

126
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,631
Why should I become a clerk?
There is no reason why I should

127
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,357
I'm a free man, without ties,
no one to worry about

128
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,200
Why should I become a clerk?

129
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,199
But you can't keep pawning books
to pay the rent

130
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,438
- Things will change
- Not without a job

131
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,679
Listen, those with real talent...

132
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,190
Needn't eat?

133
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,198
Apurba Kumar Ray

134
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,869
Make fun of me, but just wait and see

135
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,191
Something up your sleeve?
Some new poems?

136
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,198
You're too prosaic

137
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,029
You'll go abroad,
become an engineer,

138
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,553
get a fat job and settle down

139
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,029
So I'm prosaic? That's gratitude!

140
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,034
Who took you in hand in Calcutta?
Country bumpkin scared of the traffic

141
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:30,034
Who read your first short story,
and what did he say about it?

142
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,030
Don't get so worked up

143
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,757
Do you know why I feel so elated?

144
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,029
I've had my first good meal
for months, thanks to you

145
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,358
Well, are you writing anything?

146
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,595
A wonderful novel

147
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,713
Why didn't you tell me?

148
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,358
- Do you know a good publisher?
- No problem

149
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,040
A boy

150
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,152
A village boy.
Poor, but sensitive

151
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,033
Father, a priest. He dies

152
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,679
The boy doesn't want to be a priest.
He wants to study, he's ambitious

153
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,753
He studies

154
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,078
In the process, I see him struggle

155
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,990
He sheds superstition and prejudice

156
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,794
He takes nothing on trust

157
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,036
He tries to be rational

158
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:53,429
He has imagination,
he's intrigued by little things

159
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:59,431
He has greatness in him, perhaps.
He has the ability to create

160
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,358
But he doesn't

161
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,359
Right, but that's not a tragedy

162
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,315
He remains poor, in want

163
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,674
But he doesn't turn from life,
he doesn't want to escape

164
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:19,034
He is fulfilled, he wants to live

165
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,676
This is autobiography

166
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,035
Partly, but there are imaginary
characters, plot, love...

167
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,431
Love?
What do you know of love?

168
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,473
You've never been
within ten paces of a girl

169
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,479
It's not that easy,
you have no experience

170
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:46,039
- Is imagination worth nothing?
- Not where love is concerned

171
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,551
- You're quite wrong
- I'm absolutely right

172
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,196
How much further wilt thou lead me,
O Fair One?

173
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,711
Tell me what shore thy golden boat
will touch

174
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,639
Whatever I ask thee, O thou
from distant lands

175
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,957
Thou smilest in thine own sweet way

176
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,437
And I can never know
what is in thy mind

177
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,234
Silently, thou liftest a finger
pointing to the trackless, wild sea

178
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,115
As, far to the west,
the sun goes down in the sky

179
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,798
What lies there?
What do we go to seek?

180
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,629
Tell me, I pray thee,
O stranger fair

181
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,117
Where, at the edge of evening,
glows the day...

182
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,318
Give me your hand

183
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,119
Wonderful. Really wonderful

184
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,751
Look who is here!

185
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,396
It's Pulu, and not alone

186
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:14,391
I hope the journey was not
too unpleasant for city people

187
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,117
My youngest son, Murari.

188
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,233
He's studying at Daulatpur College

189
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,398
Take his luggage

190
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,397
My aunt

191
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,711
It's a pity you didn't think of him
as a possible son-in-law

192
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,389
Where have I seen him before?

193
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,035
Impossible. He's never been here

194
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,392
But I know his face so well

195
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,189
Yes, I saw a picture of Lord Krishna
looking just like him

196
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,238
Lord Krishna...

197
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,715
...complete with his flute

198
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,830
Binu, my son, come out now

199
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,830
What's wrong? Isn't he well?

200
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,997
It's nothing. The sun was so hot

201
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,833
The long journey and the fasting
must have upset him

202
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,831
Bring water, and a fan

203
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,713
This is a fine wedding

204
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,719
That boy is insane

205
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,675
Who says so? He is perfectly sane.

206
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,518
The journey and the heat...

207
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,951
If you don't stop the wedding, I will

208
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,994
But the auspicious hour is passing

209
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,669
Leave this room!

210
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,916
It's you who is mad

211
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:09,150
When the hour has passed,
my daughter will never marry

212
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,795
Isn't there another auspicious hour,
at ten?

213
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,154
Don't ask me. This means ruin for me

214
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,952
Have I missed the ceremony?

215
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,795
There's no wedding

216
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,159
The bridegroom is mad

217
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,398
Apu, everything depends on you now

218
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,755
Are you joking?

219
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,032
What is all this?

220
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,835
If the wedding does not take place
at the auspicious times...

221
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,509
...the bride is cursed

222
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,233
But what can I do?

223
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:34,755
We have to find another husband for
her and you are the obvious choice

224
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,150
You want me
to be a substitute bridegroom?

225
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:51,436
Is this a play or a novel?
What do you take me for?

226
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:57,832
Are you still living
in the Dark Ages?

227
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,113
Calm down and listen to me

228
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,789
No, I won't listen
to a pack of lunatics

229
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,150
Everything depends on you

230
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,159
It's no use, let's go

231
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,152
Come here a moment

232
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,358
Can you really get me that job?

233
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,957
You'll have to lend me a shirt,
and I must have a shave

234
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,275
Your daughter
didn't worship Shiva in vain.

235
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,313
A curse became a blessing

236
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,352
The moment I saw him,

237
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:12,475
I knew he was nearer to me
than my own kin

238
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:19,074
Pulu has brought many
of his friends here...

239
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,399
...but I've never felt so drawn
to anyone

240
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,317
There are a few things
that I must tell you

241
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,159
I've had no opportunity before

242
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,477
How much do you know about me?

243
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,150
Has Pulu told you anything?

244
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,032
Yes

245
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,150
What did he say?

246
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,999
You're an orphan

247
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,117
Yes.

248
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,950
I lost my father when I was ten

249
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,794
Mother died seven years later

250
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,876
I had a sister, too

251
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,160
What else did he tell you?

252
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,556
You write well

253
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,150
He told you that, did he?

254
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,151
Can you read?

255
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,955
Yes. Bengali

256
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,398
I'm writing my novel in Bengali

257
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,432
I know

258
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,152
What else did he say?

259
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,317
Nothing else

260
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,799
That's not very much

261
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,194
You know little
of the man you married

262
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,352
I have no means, no job...

263
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,954
...and almost no future

264
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:21,035
What kind of home
shall I take you to?

265
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,149
You've been brought up
in these surroundings

266
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:33,151
A spacious house, servants,
fine rooms

267
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,713
This marriage was forced on me.

268
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,151
I was against it, but...

269
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,469
Something changed my mind,
I felt I would be doing a noble thing

270
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,158
Everything became confused

271
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,715
Why don't you say something?

272
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,151
I can't decide
until I know your mind

273
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:13,958
Aparna, will you be able
to endure poverty?

274
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,150
Can you live with a poor husband?

275
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,836
Yes

276
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,477
Can you really?

277
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,197
Why not?

278
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,319
Then I'll take you with me.

279
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,273
If your father objects,
I'll ignore him

280
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,358
- Will you object?
- I don't know

281
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,319
- I wonder what they'll say
- Who?

282
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,352
My neighbours.

283
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:15,315
I went to a wedding,
but I shall return with the bride

284
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,794
I'll come back for the luggage

285
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,793
This is my room

286
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,236
Sit down. I won't be long

287
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,835
You must be very sad

288
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,028
Really not?

289
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,118
They want to see us downstairs

290
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:27,111
Make way. Let's see the bride

291
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,677
What a lovely bride!

292
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,034
Why gawp? Am I new?

293
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,713
Only after meals. You promised

294
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,953
Do you lament your decision?

295
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,959
What?
I don't know such difficult words

296
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,789
Will "regret" do?

297
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,309
Yes

298
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,114
- Do you regret it?
- Regret what?

299
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,311
- Do I have to explain that too?
- Yes

300
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,791
You missed out on a rich husband

301
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,638
- You're laughing!
- No, I'm crying

302
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,829
You must feel sorry

303
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:02,835
Of course.
I could have had an easy life

304
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,950
- I'm going.
- Where?

305
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,117
To look for a maid servant

306
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,111
Don't be silly. Come back, please

307
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,115
Who will pay for the servant?

308
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,119
I'll get more private lessons

309
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,439
Then send me back to my parents

310
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:10,797
One lesson is bad enough
after a hard day's work

311
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,116
What should I do, then?

312
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:21,439
I'll tell you:
Give up the lesson you have

313
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,279
And then what?

314
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:30,275
Then my poor husband
will come home early

315
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,870
Then I shall lament no more

316
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:24,030
God of Fire!
Destroy his meditation!

317
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:50,270
Are you cross with me?

318
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:55,631
Yes. Why do we always take a cab?

319
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,957
Buses are crowded. We're alone here

320
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,516
But it costs much more

321
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,273
Does it matter?

322
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:10,912
Soon you're going to your parents,
my expenses will be halved

323
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,314
Only for two months

324
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:16,754
Isn't that a long time?

325
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,710
What about the extra expenses
when we come back?

326
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,712
Ah, yes...

327
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:39,911
I wouldn't have let you go,
but your mother was so insistent

328
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,590
And I felt you'd rather be with her

329
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,835
at such a time

330
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:48,669
A relief for you, too.
No one to bother you for two months

331
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,280
One job will be done

332
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:59,395
I'll have time to work on my novel.
I haven't touched it since we married

333
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,188
Is that my fault?

334
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:09,998
No, it's your virtue. You know how
much my novel means to me, don't you?

335
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,195
- Well, you mean much more
- Really?

336
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,278
I shall dedicate it to you

337
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,789
You'll what?

338
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,714
I know what "wife" means

339
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:31,511
You don't. I do

340
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,677
I do, too

341
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:46,397
- What?
- The matches

342
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,158
What is there in your eyes?

343
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:15,998
Kohl

344
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,836
We'll expect you in the holidays

345
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:34,829
I'll do my best. Send a telegram
when you arrive; letters take so long

346
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,910
- Promise you'll come
- Haven't I given my word?

347
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,997
You must write twice a week

348
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,840
- You must write, too
- Not unless you do

349
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,998
Write to my office address,
or Mr. Ray will open your letters

350
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,795
I had so many things to tell you

351
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:14,470
Yes, I asked Pintu's mother
to make you some cakes

352
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,678
There's a bill to pay at the grocer's

353
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:21,077
I've left some jewellery behind

354
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,794
Please take care of yourself

355
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:43,029
You'll see her in a week,
so cheer up

356
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,594
I wish I knew your secret

357
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:59,710
How to be married and happy
on forty-five rupees a month

358
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,719
How do you know I'm happy?

359
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,718
I can guess

360
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:25,389
I don't know what your wife is like,
but mine...

361
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:30,399
I like them to be a little pert...

362
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:35,390
...a little saucy, a little naughty

363
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:41,599
It adds spice to a marriage,

364
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,438
don't you think?

365
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,878
My wife is just the opposite

366
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:53,792
Never quarrels, never complains,
never answers back...

367
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,992
...always meek and obedient

368
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:01,709
Utterly bland, tasteless

369
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,638
Plus this

370
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,955
You've promised to come on the 8th

371
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:28,951
<i>f you don't, I'll never speak</i>
to you again, never, ever

372
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:33,711
You should have sent me
eight letters last month...

373
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,472
...and I only got seven

374
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,389
<i>should never trust you</i>

375
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,437
And I feel jealous of that girl
next door

376
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:27,238
She sees you morning and evening,
and I don't

377
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,795
Do keep the window shut

378
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:17,037
What else is there to tell?

379
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:22,030
The more I write, the more
you will laugh at my mistakes

380
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:27,110
ut I don't care.
You are the writer, not me

381
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,719
Please take good care of yourself

382
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,391
<i>am well, but my heart is sick.</i>
<i>T will heal when you come</i>

383
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:40,117
<i>f you don't, I'll never speak</i>
to you again, never, ever

384
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:56,590
What is it?

385
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,832
Aparna...

386
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,076
In childbirth...

387
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:49,872
She said: "I'm leaving him
in your care, Mrs. Ganguly

388
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:53,869
"He's so absent-minded,
he forgets to eat sometimes"

389
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,872
Such sweet words
and such gentle ways

390
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:06,188
Well, it's a good thing
the baby was saved.

391
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,835
Fate works in strange ways

392
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:15,708
But a young fellow like you
shouldn't give up

393
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:21,916
"While Krishna has
his knot of hair and flute

394
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,714
there'll be women to serve him"

395
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,993
Why, you could marry ten times over
if you wanted

396
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:22,670
Dear Pulu. You must have heard
the news by now

397
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,470
<i>hear you're going abroad.</i>
<i>Wish you success</i>

398
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,876
<i>'m going away, too</i>

399
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,469
<i>don't know where I'm going,</i>

400
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,036
ut I do know why:
<i>Want to be free</i>

401
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:38,198
<i>'m taking my novel with me.</i>

402
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:41,199
<i>'Ll send it to you if I finish it</i>

403
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:44,278
You may publish it
<i>f you like it enough.</i>

404
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,199
Yours, Apu

405
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:04,152
What have you thrown in my food?

406
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,312
I'll teach you a lesson, my lad!

407
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,510
He's bitten me

408
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:27,158
Wait and see
what your grandfather will do

409
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:31,279
You'll tell grandfather?

410
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:35,189
Just wait. You need a good hiding

411
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,031
He'll bash you if you do

412
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:42,192
Who will bash me?

413
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:46,271
My father. He lives in Calcutta

414
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:51,670
Father! That's a good one!

415
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:58,479
We haven't seen his pigtail
these last five years

416
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,833
Do fathers have pigtails?

417
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:18,995
He's not shown up once,
even to see his own son

418
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:22,076
He's sent three money orders.

419
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:26,876
Perhaps he calls that doing his duty

420
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:29,674
Where is Apu?

421
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:32,838
I was dead against the marriage

422
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:39,150
It was you and your aunt
who took my daughter...

423
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:44,514
Do you know where Apu is?
I'd just like to know

424
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:50,158
Somewhere in Central India, working
in some coal mine, the vagabond

425
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:54,672
And the boy takes after him

426
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:59,670
Always running around
and getting up to mischief

427
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:03,157
When your aunt was alive
she could manage him,

428
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:06,477
but it's too much for me

429
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,516
Do you know Apu's address?

430
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:13,679
Whatever is on his letter

431
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:16,474
Do you think he'll come back?

432
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:21,675
Not that heartless brute

433
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,438
When did you get back?

434
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,432
I went to my uncle, looking for you

435
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:43,834
- What are you doing here?
- Working

436
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:48,556
- Since when?
- About a year

437
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:52,114
So far from home?

438
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,755
I didn't come here for a job

439
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:59,512
I arrived here in my wanderings

440
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,917
I had to fill my stomach

441
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:08,079
- Has it been filled now?
- More or less

442
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:11,750
How is the novel getting along?

443
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:16,550
I threw it away

444
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,350
Why throw it away?

445
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,473
What's the use?

446
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,148
Come along

447
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,352
Are you going to stay here?

448
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:42,472
- I'm thinking of going away
- Where?

449
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:47,149
Anywhere. Perhaps abroad.
I'm saving up

450
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:50,679
Going alone?

451
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:54,635
- Who else is there?
- Kajal

452
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:01,631
Your son

453
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:09,153
So that's what they called him

454
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:29,311
- Go back home
- Why?

455
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:35,154
The boy needs someone
to look after him

456
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:39,469
There's such a thing
as a father's duty,

457
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,637
or did you throw duty away, too?

458
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:46,311
Who says I don't do my duty?
I've sent money

459
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:52,630
- Is that all you can do?
- I can't do any more

460
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:05,149
Don't you love your son?

461
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:11,151
No

462
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,954
How can I love him?

463
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:25,558
I've never seen him,
to me he is unreal, untrue

464
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:29,154
For me he doesn't exist

465
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:35,957
You must have lost your senses

466
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:47,354
Anyway, I've done my duty.
The rest is up to you

467
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,635
Come here for a moment

468
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:03,438
My train leaves at seven

469
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:09,390
Come here

470
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:23,709
Please do something for the boy,
put him in a home or something

471
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,310
- Do that yourself
- No, I can't

472
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:34,629
- It's not possible for me
- I can't understand why not

473
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:39,637
There is something
which I can't forget

474
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,518
Because Kajal exists...

475
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:53,518
Aparna does not

476
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:00,639
I've sent money
and I'll send more if necessary

477
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:11,313
More than that, I cannot do

478
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:17,950
I have no love for him.
He is like a stranger

479
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:23,312
If you think
he is not being looked after...

480
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:28,151
...make some arrangement for him

481
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:38,637
Shall I give you money now?

482
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:43,755
I've no time. I have to start
a new job on Monday

483
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:55,634
Who is it?

484
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:04,150
Who do you want?

485
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:11,395
I'm Apurba

486
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:39,834
Have you come to fetch him?

487
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:43,873
I've arranged to leave him
with friends in my home village

488
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:47,757
I'm going away

489
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:50,429
He's upstairs

490
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:55,518
He's been feverish,
but he's better now

491
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:54,589
I'm your father

492
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:38,028
What are you doing?

493
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:45,553
You might have killed the boy

494
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:59,070
Won't you make friends with me?

495
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:03,158
I know lots of good stories

496
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:08,150
Ghost stories,
stories about demons...

497
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:13,435
...kings, queens, princes
and winged horses

498
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:19,279
Want to hear them?

499
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:35,514
I'll leave this jewellery with you...

500
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:39,315
...in case you want to send him
to boarding school

501
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:44,151
It seems to be the only way
to be relieved of his burden

502
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:52,152
Can't you take him with you by force?

503
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:56,149
As his father
you have the right to do that

504
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,151
No, I couldn't do that

505
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:07,149
I knew it. I knew all along
that you could do nothing

506
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:20,511
What do you want to say, Kajal?

507
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:23,554
Where are you going?

508
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:26,034
Will you come with me?

509
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:29,353
Are you going to Calcutta?

510
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,397
If I did, would you come with me?

511
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:35,432
Would you take me to my father?

512
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:39,676
Certainly

513
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,838
Will he be cross with me?

514
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:46,749
Why should he be?

515
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,877
He'll never leave me?

516
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:55,749
Never

517
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:02,236
Who are you?

518
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:08,311
I'm your friend

519
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:12,591
Will you come with me?

520
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:27,079
Grandpa will be angry

521
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:32,389
Grandpa won't know, I won't tell him
