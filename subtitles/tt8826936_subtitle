1
00:03:41,736 --> 00:03:44,315
- Get inside...
- Let us go!

2
00:03:44,395 --> 00:03:46,455
Leave us...

3
00:04:09,504 --> 00:04:10,264
Hey...

4
00:04:10,464 --> 00:04:11,464
Take her with you.

5
00:04:11,624 --> 00:04:13,224
Once you are done with them,

6
00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:15,104
we'll dump them in the river.

7
00:04:15,184 --> 00:04:15,824
Leave me.

8
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:36,184
Who the hell are you?

9
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:44,024
There is no one around,
who has not heard of me...

10
00:04:44,304 --> 00:04:46,304
And to let someone go
without bashing...

11
00:04:46,664 --> 00:04:48,704
Is not this 'Mauli's' style.

12
00:05:22,504 --> 00:05:25,264
Generally, people run the
moment they see me enter.

13
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:27,664
Since, you have
decided to stay back...

14
00:05:28,944 --> 00:05:31,224
I promise to not
disappoint you.

15
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,424
When a girl is educated
progress is assured...

16
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:01,424
And when a boy
is not educated...

17
00:06:02,304 --> 00:06:03,704
He turns into a local goon.

18
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,064
Can I teach them
a few lessons?

19
00:06:06,264 --> 00:06:07,064
Sure!

20
00:06:12,784 --> 00:06:14,224
Let's start with History.

21
00:06:14,864 --> 00:06:16,944
When someone
misbehaves with a lady...

22
00:06:17,304 --> 00:06:18,824
We thrash them right there.

23
00:06:28,064 --> 00:06:29,984
That was my History lesson.

24
00:06:30,942 --> 00:06:32,304
Now the second one...

25
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:33,904
Mathematics lesson.

26
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:36,024
If a single brick can
break 8 teeth...

27
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:38,344
How many teeth can
be shattered with 2 bricks?

28
00:06:38,624 --> 00:06:39,344
Sixteen!

29
00:06:40,504 --> 00:06:41,464
Thirty-two.

30
00:06:41,784 --> 00:06:42,544
Let me show you.

31
00:06:52,384 --> 00:06:53,464
Now let's learn
a 'Marathi' lesson.

32
00:06:54,304 --> 00:06:56,144
Let's start with idioms.

33
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:59,344
Once bitten, twice?

34
00:06:59,584 --> 00:07:00,424
Shy!

35
00:07:01,424 --> 00:07:02,824
And... they will fly!

36
00:07:18,864 --> 00:07:20,944
Be your own bodyguard...

37
00:07:21,384 --> 00:07:22,384
Here, take this brick.

38
00:07:23,584 --> 00:07:25,264
If you find someone
misbehaving with you.

39
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:26,824
Just smash it on his head.

40
00:07:27,184 --> 00:07:28,344
- Sure.
- If someone questions you.

41
00:07:28,464 --> 00:07:31,024
Jus say, 'Mauli' is in me.

42
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:32,624
How is the idea?

43
00:07:32,864 --> 00:07:33,784
Simply superb!

44
00:07:35,264 --> 00:07:37,024
Everyone knows it.

45
00:08:07,184 --> 00:08:08,544
Hey, wait...

46
00:08:08,624 --> 00:08:09,464
Greetings!

47
00:08:09,544 --> 00:08:10,784
Greetings!

48
00:08:12,864 --> 00:08:14,064
Hey... what are you up to?

49
00:08:14,264 --> 00:08:15,544
She is the one who
told me...

50
00:08:15,806 --> 00:08:17,104
to colour you,
the moment I see you.

51
00:08:17,904 --> 00:08:20,104
She is back again for the 'Holi'
celebrations. (Festival of colours)

52
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:53,176
"On this beautiful
Holi celebrations day..."

53
00:08:55,556 --> 00:08:58,767
"Where are you off to my dear?"

54
00:09:01,184 --> 00:09:04,104
"On this beautiful
Holi celebrations day..."

55
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:06,754
"Where are you off to my dear?"

56
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:09,624
"Show me some love,
I am the one with super swag."

57
00:09:09,704 --> 00:09:12,120
"Tag me as your lover."

58
00:09:12,424 --> 00:09:15,264
"Show me some love,
I am the one with super swag."

59
00:09:15,344 --> 00:09:17,955
"Tag me as your lover."

60
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,504
"Now don't be upset dear..."

61
00:09:19,584 --> 00:09:20,904
"This colour will go off,"

62
00:09:20,984 --> 00:09:24,280
"once you wash your sari
with 'Surf'(Detergent)."

63
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:41,144
"Why are you angry my dear?"

64
00:09:41,224 --> 00:09:43,904
"Here, I say sorry!"

65
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:46,904
"Let's play with colours and"

66
00:09:46,984 --> 00:09:49,264
"post a story on your 'Instagram'."

67
00:09:49,344 --> 00:09:52,398
"I spent some money..."

68
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:55,384
"To get some eco-friendly colours."

69
00:09:55,504 --> 00:10:00,384
"Even Krishna and Gopika will
make this hash-tag trend."

70
00:10:00,544 --> 00:10:03,415
"Now cheer-up and
do not wipe your colours,"

71
00:10:03,495 --> 00:10:06,024
"Splash the remaining colours on me."

72
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:09,024
"Now cheer-up and
do not wipe your colours,"

73
00:10:09,104 --> 00:10:11,504
"Splash the remaining colours on me."

74
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,064
"Now don't be upset dear..."

75
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:14,624
"This colour will go off,"

76
00:10:14,704 --> 00:10:17,704
"once you wash your sari
with 'Surf'."

77
00:10:54,824 --> 00:10:57,424
"Just stop for some time..."

78
00:10:57,624 --> 00:11:00,184
"Let me tell you something."

79
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:05,224
"This continuous dancing
is burning my calories."

80
00:11:05,824 --> 00:11:08,624
"Everyone around
is like a king here..."

81
00:11:08,944 --> 00:11:11,624
"They are my dear friends."

82
00:11:11,784 --> 00:11:14,384
"Now that they are here to
celebrate with me."

83
00:11:14,544 --> 00:11:16,584
"And the DJ has stopped
playing music."

84
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,064
"I will simply now, shout..."

85
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,464
"And you do not doubt...

86
00:11:19,544 --> 00:11:22,184
"Kindly give me your lovely
pout, right now..."

87
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:23,824
"I will simply now, shout"

88
00:11:23,904 --> 00:11:25,144
"And you do not doubt..."

89
00:11:25,224 --> 00:11:27,824
"Kindly give me your lovely
pout, right now..."

90
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,344
"Now don't be upset dear..."

91
00:11:29,424 --> 00:11:30,704
"This colour will go off,"

92
00:11:30,784 --> 00:11:33,584
"once you wash your sari
with 'Surf'."

93
00:11:47,904 --> 00:11:49,304
Hey Mauli.

94
00:11:51,064 --> 00:11:52,064
Where are you off to?

95
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:55,464
Do you think, you are my
only priority?

96
00:11:56,624 --> 00:11:58,184
I am done with this...

97
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,824
Now I have some
other task to attend.

98
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:27,061
We have reached
'Kaapur' village...

99
00:12:29,994 --> 00:12:30,652
Money?

100
00:12:30,732 --> 00:12:31,835
No I don't want...

101
00:12:31,915 --> 00:12:33,967
We have reached
'Kaapur' village...

102
00:12:35,424 --> 00:12:36,064
Very tasty tea...

103
00:12:36,144 --> 00:12:37,584
The taste of Kerosene
was amazing.

104
00:12:37,664 --> 00:12:38,864
Hey you free-loader...
pay for the tea...

105
00:12:38,944 --> 00:12:40,864
I have a 15 rupee note, will get some
change and pay you soon.

106
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:42,982
- I'll get you change
- Or else take a 30 rupees note tomorrow.

107
00:12:43,464 --> 00:12:44,784
Oh! a cop, here?

108
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:47,824
- Greetings!
- Greetings...

109
00:12:48,824 --> 00:12:49,704
Come, let's go!

110
00:12:50,624 --> 00:12:51,344
Are you okay
to ride this?

111
00:12:52,544 --> 00:12:53,584
Of course...
What's wrong in that?

112
00:12:53,824 --> 00:12:54,544
Let's go.

113
00:12:55,504 --> 00:12:57,264
Okay... I don't mind.

114
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:04,744
Where are you from?

115
00:13:04,824 --> 00:13:05,464
This village...

116
00:13:05,544 --> 00:13:06,904
I can be seen here, there...

117
00:13:06,984 --> 00:13:08,024
everywhere.

118
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:10,064
Yesterday the bus went over me.
I escaped death, very narrowly...

119
00:13:10,424 --> 00:13:12,264
I was sitting under the bridge
and the bus went over the bridge.

120
00:13:13,664 --> 00:13:16,064
I got lucky!

121
00:13:16,144 --> 00:13:18,024
You arrived at your destination.

122
00:13:20,028 --> 00:13:20,624
May I take your leave?

123
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:21,624
Didn't he hear what I said?

124
00:13:22,104 --> 00:13:23,144
May I take your leave?

125
00:13:24,146 --> 00:13:24,704
Sure!

126
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:26,784
Give me whatever
you feel like.

127
00:13:26,864 --> 00:13:28,384
Either a 20 rupee
coin or a 40 rupee note.

128
00:13:28,464 --> 00:13:29,544
And I will dismiss this case...

129
00:13:29,886 --> 00:13:31,424
A cop like you is
asking for a tip?

130
00:13:31,784 --> 00:13:34,784
I am not a cop sir,
I am just a street artist...

131
00:13:34,864 --> 00:13:35,944
My name is 'Kadaknath Kalele'

132
00:13:37,264 --> 00:13:38,584
I have just one demand,

133
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:40,344
stop defecating in public.

134
00:13:40,704 --> 00:13:42,344
Okay... pay me quick.

135
00:13:42,584 --> 00:13:44,584
It's my father-in-law's wedding,
on 32nd of this month,

136
00:13:44,664 --> 00:13:45,504
I have made
some salted sweets...

137
00:13:45,584 --> 00:13:46,664
Have fried some Indian
bread in kerosene.

138
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:47,824
I made some bright
white soap rice too...

139
00:13:47,904 --> 00:13:49,344
All guests will surely enjoy.

140
00:13:49,824 --> 00:13:50,944
Oh I see...

141
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:54,344
Tell me something more
about this village.

142
00:13:57,264 --> 00:13:58,064
Villagers are mute,

143
00:13:58,144 --> 00:13:58,944
The village deity is
a mere guard.

144
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:01,224
Pilgrims get subsidy,
drunkards get hand-cuffed...

145
00:14:01,304 --> 00:14:03,464
Water is available 24x7,
but criminals get jailed...

146
00:14:03,544 --> 00:14:04,984
You have a job,
but you will be jobless.

147
00:14:06,544 --> 00:14:07,304
Where do I park this?

148
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:09,304
Why do you ask me?

149
00:14:10,344 --> 00:14:11,104
Is it not yours?

150
00:14:12,864 --> 00:14:14,704
He already started questioning
before the theft.

151
00:14:15,464 --> 00:14:18,664
Theft rate goes up
when cops are around.

152
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:19,944
I will take your leave.

153
00:14:20,344 --> 00:14:21,224
What about this?

154
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,966
The rightful owner will take it.

155
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:27,904
Glad it had some fuel in it...

156
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,883
No, it's not that, Sayyed...

157
00:14:35,003 --> 00:14:36,933
Working as a cop is simpler...

158
00:14:37,013 --> 00:14:39,520
But, playing cards at work is tough.

159
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:49,224
If you lose the game today,
your wife will make you starve.

160
00:14:50,096 --> 00:14:51,784
Shut up! don't remind me of her.

161
00:14:52,984 --> 00:14:54,144
Your turn!

162
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:56,904
Let me explain...

163
00:14:57,184 --> 00:14:58,584
deal the Jack of spade...

164
00:14:59,184 --> 00:15:01,304
Who the hell are
you to instruct me? idiot!

165
00:15:02,904 --> 00:15:03,704
This idiot...

166
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:06,509
... is the new in-charge
of this place.

167
00:15:09,664 --> 00:15:10,584
Sir,

168
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:11,344
my name is Sayyed...

169
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:12,704
This is Mr. Salunke,

170
00:15:12,784 --> 00:15:13,784
this is constable Rane...

171
00:15:13,864 --> 00:15:16,864
And he is our senior most cop
Mr.Bhanudas Thupe.

172
00:15:17,144 --> 00:15:19,664
I am 'Inspector
Mauli Sarjerao Deshmukh'

173
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:20,944
I have completed 6 years of service...

174
00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:22,064
This is my third posting.

175
00:15:33,424 --> 00:15:34,824
I worship my duty...

176
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,704
And I treat criminals as humans...

177
00:15:37,735 --> 00:15:40,104
I have never let a case
go out of my station...

178
00:15:40,384 --> 00:15:41,424
I believe...

179
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:43,824
Police men are meant
to solve problems...

180
00:15:44,664 --> 00:15:45,784
and not to create one.

181
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,104
If you say so!

182
00:15:47,664 --> 00:15:48,984
This is of no use to me...

183
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:50,184
He is one amongst us.

184
00:15:51,944 --> 00:15:53,159
I am fine with
your behaviour...

185
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:56,544
But no more playing cards
in front of 'Bapu'.

186
00:15:57,462 --> 00:15:58,464
Oh!

187
00:15:58,664 --> 00:15:59,584
Sayyed!

188
00:15:59,729 --> 00:16:01,784
Move 'Bapu's' picture
out of this room.

189
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,784
Sir, he is the only one
who can adjust with us.

190
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:19,064
Sir, this is for you...

191
00:16:19,224 --> 00:16:20,344
How much do I owe you?

192
00:16:21,444 --> 00:16:23,544
Sir, please help...

193
00:16:23,624 --> 00:16:24,904
What's the matter?

194
00:16:25,323 --> 00:16:26,704
Just look at her...

195
00:17:05,144 --> 00:17:06,824
Hey, hold on...

196
00:17:07,265 --> 00:17:08,224
Ma'am what's the matter?

197
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,144
You may ask...

198
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:11,824
Ask this entire village...

199
00:17:11,904 --> 00:17:13,704
Who is the one to sell
the authentic spices?

200
00:17:14,904 --> 00:17:15,984
Renuka!

201
00:17:16,224 --> 00:17:17,064
Oh!

202
00:17:17,144 --> 00:17:20,544
Who do you think gave him
and his brother my spices to sell?

203
00:17:22,424 --> 00:17:23,344
Renuka!

204
00:17:24,304 --> 00:17:27,384
Who caught him red handed
adulterating my spices?

205
00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:33,864
Renuka?

206
00:17:34,885 --> 00:17:35,984
Very impressive.

207
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:38,224
Sir,

208
00:17:38,464 --> 00:17:39,984
If I lose my spices
I will get it back...

209
00:17:40,264 --> 00:17:41,264
What if I lose my trust?

210
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:43,464
Be it spices or humans...

211
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:46,984
This Renuka can spot the
genuine and fake...

212
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:50,424
Fake products can never
match up the real one.

213
00:17:50,865 --> 00:17:52,584
I will bash you black and blue...

214
00:17:52,664 --> 00:17:53,784
Hold on.

215
00:17:54,224 --> 00:17:56,224
I will teach him
a good lesson.

216
00:17:57,504 --> 00:18:00,704
Hey... aren't you a
responsible citizen...

217
00:18:01,464 --> 00:18:04,064
As per IPC Section 272,

218
00:18:04,224 --> 00:18:06,464
I can imprison
you for 6 months,

219
00:18:06,664 --> 00:18:09,057
with a fine up to Rs.1000.

220
00:18:10,104 --> 00:18:10,904
Now...

221
00:18:10,984 --> 00:18:12,144
Arrest him right away.

222
00:18:12,264 --> 00:18:14,104
Else I will whip
him in front of all.

223
00:18:14,184 --> 00:18:14,904
Ma'am...

224
00:18:15,184 --> 00:18:16,504
Let me explain...

225
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:18,824
If you punish him...

226
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:20,464
You will be at loss.

227
00:18:20,944 --> 00:18:22,144
People will come to
know about the adulteration.

228
00:18:22,304 --> 00:18:23,224
You will lose business.

229
00:18:23,544 --> 00:18:24,864
And eventually you will
have to shut shop.

230
00:18:25,624 --> 00:18:26,424
Just think about it...

231
00:18:26,944 --> 00:18:30,184
'Anger' is one letter
short of 'Danger'.

232
00:18:30,824 --> 00:18:31,624
Do you agree, Thupe?

233
00:18:31,704 --> 00:18:32,464
You are right sir...

234
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,144
I received the same quote
this morning.

235
00:18:36,304 --> 00:18:37,144
Quite possible...

236
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:39,824
Okay... forget it...

237
00:18:40,024 --> 00:18:41,224
Be kind and forgive him...

238
00:18:41,544 --> 00:18:42,424
Forgive me please, sister.

239
00:18:42,984 --> 00:18:43,464
Go, say sorry.

240
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:44,584
Forgive me please, sister.

241
00:18:44,664 --> 00:18:46,904
I will never repeat this, ever.

242
00:18:47,144 --> 00:18:50,184
See, what I had to go
through because of him.

243
00:19:00,914 --> 00:19:02,464
Very impressive.

244
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:10,689
Come on, pick it up!

245
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:15,809
Dharma...

246
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:16,969
Will they listen to us?

247
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:18,169
Who cares?

248
00:19:18,447 --> 00:19:19,489
We will stick to our guns.

249
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:20,969
Who are they to decide?

250
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:22,809
Okay... see you later.

251
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:35,529
Hey!

252
00:19:38,689 --> 00:19:39,489
Uncle!

253
00:19:45,489 --> 00:19:46,009
He is fine now...

254
00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:47,529
You come with me.

255
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:52,169
Sir!

256
00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:03,929
A water-tanker driver knocked
him down, I witnessed it.

257
00:20:04,688 --> 00:20:07,289
I saw 'Blessings of Hanuman'
graphics on the tanker.

258
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:10,689
People were just watching.

259
00:20:11,102 --> 00:20:12,489
Not a single person
came forward to help.

260
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:14,169
Then I brought him here.

261
00:20:14,925 --> 00:20:16,529
You are so kind...

262
00:20:17,068 --> 00:20:18,649
That's the need
of the hour.

263
00:20:20,181 --> 00:20:21,369
Kindly lodge my complaint.

264
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,369
You may go to the
outskirts of this village.

265
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:26,218
All water tankers are
parked on a ground there.

266
00:20:27,252 --> 00:20:28,209
I will look into it.

267
00:20:29,387 --> 00:20:30,289
Thupe!

268
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:31,289
You wait here...

269
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:33,009
Record his statement
when he wakes up.

270
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:34,329
I will go and enquire.

271
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:38,089
Sayyed, let's go.

272
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,369
[Men playing Kabbadi]

273
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:51,729
Sir, are you sure?

274
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:59,569
[Men playing Kabbadi]

275
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:12,761
Who was driving this tanker
with 'Blessings of Hanuman' on this?

276
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,529
He is the new guy in our village.

277
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:17,409
That's him...

278
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,649
What's the matter?

279
00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:20,049
He knocked a pedestrian,

280
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:21,529
he is expected to
visit us for an enquiry.

281
00:21:21,729 --> 00:21:22,612
We are busy with our game...

282
00:21:22,692 --> 00:21:24,249
Let him come for an enquiry...

283
00:21:24,489 --> 00:21:26,609
If he is not guilty
we will let him go.

284
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:27,969
He can't come...
go to hell...

285
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:32,129
If he doesn't come,
I may have to step in...

286
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:35,249
Oh... sure...

287
00:21:35,969 --> 00:21:38,369
Come just touch him...
and he is yours...

288
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:47,489
Let me explain...

289
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,609
Now that you have
stepped into our court...

290
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:55,409
Let's play for a while.

291
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:11,929
Come dear...

292
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,329
Touch him!

293
00:23:38,369 --> 00:23:41,089
If you ever try to show off
your power and position.

294
00:23:41,444 --> 00:23:43,729
I swear I will strip you...

295
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,649
...and bash you up in
front of everyone.

296
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:54,729
It's not as easy
as you think.

297
00:23:55,729 --> 00:23:57,969
You are new to this location...

298
00:23:58,329 --> 00:24:00,489
It's not too easy to
get everyone under control.

299
00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:20,889
You need to evaluate the situation.

300
00:24:21,249 --> 00:24:22,369
Okay... forget it.

301
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:25,009
Thankfully they spared you today.

302
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:28,489
And that man Mr. Dharma Pawar,
he is too over-smart.

303
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:29,409
Hey, you...

304
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:30,969
Don't you feel ashamed of yourself?

305
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:34,409
His wife mentioned,
it's not a mere accident...

306
00:24:34,616 --> 00:24:35,969
It's a property issue...

307
00:24:36,889 --> 00:24:38,969
And this guy took bribe from him.

308
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:41,489
Hey... It's not just my money...

309
00:24:41,769 --> 00:24:43,409
My boss too has a share in it.

310
00:24:44,412 --> 00:24:45,209
What?

311
00:24:45,503 --> 00:24:46,009
My share?

312
00:24:46,089 --> 00:24:47,049
Yes of course.

313
00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:48,769
Oh! that explains...

314
00:24:49,609 --> 00:24:50,969
Now I know...

315
00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:55,729
Every cop posted in this
village changes in a day.

316
00:24:56,169 --> 00:24:58,129
And you showed your
true colour a little too soon.

317
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:01,289
Put up your rate-card here
and make it an official business.

318
00:25:02,089 --> 00:25:04,129
And you call yourself
'Inspector Mauli'?

319
00:25:04,489 --> 00:25:07,009
You are disgusting.

320
00:25:09,857 --> 00:25:11,729
Everyone is just the same.

321
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:17,689
Sir, this is your share...

322
00:25:19,729 --> 00:25:21,169
This is just the beginning...

323
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:29,489
Open the gate!

324
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,049
[Men playing Kabbadi]

325
00:25:32,969 --> 00:25:34,289
Allow us to fill water

326
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:35,769
We have been waiting since 2 hours.

327
00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:38,249
Atrocities of these goons
will not be tolerated.

328
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:42,561
Atrocities of these goons
will not be tolerated.

329
00:26:19,409 --> 00:26:20,169
So...

330
00:26:20,585 --> 00:26:21,129
you back again?

331
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:22,569
I have realized...

332
00:26:23,569 --> 00:26:28,969
to beat someone in their
own field has its own kick.

333
00:29:26,574 --> 00:29:28,405
I heard someone's
pot crash...

334
00:29:40,689 --> 00:29:41,609
Oh gosh!

335
00:29:42,434 --> 00:29:44,489
What I heard yesterday
seemed so unreal...

336
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:47,489
What I am seeing
today looks real...

337
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:51,489
How did a bomb blow
out of a small fire cracker?

338
00:30:01,393 --> 00:30:04,393
Move aside...

339
00:30:08,944 --> 00:30:11,897
In the future if someone asks
for your maker's name.

340
00:30:12,064 --> 00:30:13,384
Tell them, it's...

341
00:30:13,744 --> 00:30:17,044
'Inspector Mauli Sarjerao Deshmukh'.

342
00:30:20,264 --> 00:30:24,504
A cop like me is in control
till the time I am in my uniform.

343
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:26,464
The moment this uniform is off,

344
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:29,504
I am the biggest terror
you shall ever encounter.

345
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:32,944
Remember,

346
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:35,224
from now...
whenever you see me...

347
00:30:35,798 --> 00:30:37,304
You have to salute...

348
00:30:37,624 --> 00:30:40,544
And say "Hello sir,"

349
00:30:40,984 --> 00:30:43,504
"what can I do for you?"

350
00:30:43,704 --> 00:30:44,824
Hello sir...

351
00:30:45,464 --> 00:30:46,664
what can I do for you?

352
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:48,029
This is how...

353
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:51,969
a strict cop takes action.

354
00:30:52,824 --> 00:30:53,704
Arrest him!

355
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:55,224
Hey come...

356
00:30:56,379 --> 00:30:57,584
Very impressive...

357
00:30:58,344 --> 00:31:00,944
Hey... do not stare at
my moustache.

358
00:31:02,104 --> 00:31:05,024
It's real...
oh Almighty."

359
00:33:11,384 --> 00:33:12,944
Oh Lord, you punished
one to be a stillborn...

360
00:33:13,148 --> 00:33:15,099
... and you blessed the
other with life.

361
00:33:15,584 --> 00:33:18,504
Aren't they both your children,
then why do you discriminate?

362
00:33:44,484 --> 00:33:45,744
Oh Lord Panduranga...

363
00:33:46,134 --> 00:33:48,864
You are our protector.

364
00:33:59,534 --> 00:34:01,904
Where there is cloud,
there is rain...

365
00:34:02,337 --> 00:34:04,244
Where there is a river,
there is water...

366
00:34:04,662 --> 00:34:06,704
Where there is a tree,
there is shade.

367
00:34:06,784 --> 00:34:10,016
Where there are children,
there is Mauli (Mother).

368
00:34:22,704 --> 00:34:25,064
Looks like he is born to
protect his brother...

369
00:34:25,704 --> 00:34:27,024
They are blessed kids.

370
00:34:28,264 --> 00:34:30,064
Hey dear...

371
00:34:30,245 --> 00:34:32,064
... what about their father,
where is he?

372
00:34:33,455 --> 00:34:34,464
He is dead.

373
00:34:35,696 --> 00:34:37,704
Everything is gone...

374
00:34:38,513 --> 00:34:40,344
I see a dark
future for myself.

375
00:34:40,574 --> 00:34:43,544
There will be utter
darkness during our journey.

376
00:34:44,006 --> 00:34:46,744
But the almighty
will light-up our way.

377
00:34:47,209 --> 00:34:48,784
The one to gives
rise to questions...

378
00:34:49,024 --> 00:34:50,984
Is the one to provide
answers to all our questions.

379
00:34:51,184 --> 00:34:53,784
Now, you may
have several doubts.

380
00:34:53,864 --> 00:34:56,264
I am a single mother,
new to this place.

381
00:34:57,226 --> 00:34:59,784
How am I going to raise
these kids single-handedly?

382
00:35:00,104 --> 00:35:01,744
Only Lord Pandurang
can help me...

383
00:35:01,824 --> 00:35:04,624
Saint Tukaram had answered
this many years ago.

384
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:08,904
We are the devotees of Lord,
we follow him blindly.

385
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,664
We don't differentiate
between anyone,

386
00:35:10,744 --> 00:35:12,584
we are all one and the same.

387
00:35:12,664 --> 00:35:16,064
We may have different bodies,
but we have the same soul.

388
00:35:16,184 --> 00:35:19,184
Whatever be your problem...

389
00:35:19,824 --> 00:35:23,304
Mauli is the answer
to everything.

390
00:35:23,866 --> 00:35:25,264
You may have different bodies,

391
00:35:25,344 --> 00:35:27,904
but your vision
will be the same... Mauli.

392
00:35:29,824 --> 00:35:33,584
We devotees of Lord Pandurang,
wherever we meet each other...

393
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,864
...how do we address one another?

394
00:35:35,944 --> 00:35:37,660
- Mauli!
- Exactly...

395
00:35:37,824 --> 00:35:44,264
Which is the word that can transform
a person into a devout pilgrim?

396
00:35:44,344 --> 00:35:45,944
Mauli!

397
00:35:46,384 --> 00:35:52,344
Mauli is the one to guide you
through every darkness of your life.

398
00:35:52,825 --> 00:35:55,504
Mauli!

399
00:35:55,584 --> 00:35:58,180
Mauli!

400
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:09,380
They both will share
the same name...

401
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,900
'Mauli'.

402
00:36:16,544 --> 00:36:17,624
How do I look?

403
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,584
Super!

404
00:36:20,224 --> 00:36:21,184
Boys!

405
00:36:22,464 --> 00:36:24,384
Who intends to
go to school today?

406
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,024
The Mauli dressed in shirt,
or the one without?

407
00:36:27,464 --> 00:36:28,504
Let him go...

408
00:36:28,824 --> 00:36:31,064
As it is, our teacher will be asking
us to recite multiplication tables.

409
00:36:33,304 --> 00:36:34,504
Brother... you go today.

410
00:36:44,214 --> 00:36:46,344
Our financial condition forces
me take this decision, dear.

411
00:36:47,704 --> 00:36:49,624
You are two different
individuals for me,

412
00:36:49,914 --> 00:36:52,984
but for the world, you
will have to live like one...

413
00:36:54,304 --> 00:36:55,864
...only then we can survive.

414
00:37:14,384 --> 00:37:16,304
Let's have some fun...

415
00:37:18,224 --> 00:37:20,584
Hey... please don't hit me...

416
00:37:21,984 --> 00:37:23,344
please don't hit me...

417
00:37:27,744 --> 00:37:28,624
Where is he going?

418
00:37:36,259 --> 00:37:38,704
I looked for you all around,
and here you are...

419
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,744
I got bashed up
in the school...

420
00:37:40,894 --> 00:37:42,344
If you get scared
of getting beaten up,

421
00:37:42,464 --> 00:37:44,344
you can never
be successful in life.

422
00:37:45,384 --> 00:37:46,984
Okay... tomorrow is my turn
to visit school, in full form.

423
00:37:47,144 --> 00:37:47,784
Why so?

424
00:37:47,864 --> 00:37:50,064
Because, tomorrow is
my turn to give it back.

425
00:37:50,144 --> 00:37:56,990
Mauli!

426
00:37:57,917 --> 00:37:58,997
No bloody fights...

427
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:00,637
Bloody, no fun.

428
00:38:00,717 --> 00:38:01,477
from now...

429
00:38:01,557 --> 00:38:02,597
whenever you see me...

430
00:38:02,677 --> 00:38:03,997
You have to salute...

431
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:06,357
And say "Hello sir,"

432
00:38:06,437 --> 00:38:07,637
"what can I do for you?"

433
00:38:07,757 --> 00:38:08,997
What did I say?

434
00:38:09,197 --> 00:38:11,077
Hello sir!
what can I do for you?

435
00:38:13,009 --> 00:38:15,237
Hello sir!
what can I do for you?

436
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,409
Hello sir!
what can I do for you?

437
00:38:22,757 --> 00:38:24,157
Hello sir...
Please come over...

438
00:38:24,357 --> 00:38:25,357
What can I do for you?

439
00:38:27,957 --> 00:38:30,117
Hello sir...
Please come over...

440
00:38:47,757 --> 00:38:49,997
Hello sir!
what can I do for you?

441
00:39:00,053 --> 00:39:02,357
I hope the injury
is not too bad?

442
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:04,077
Me?

443
00:39:04,637 --> 00:39:05,957
No, not you, I meant those
guys, you bashed.

444
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,077
Nope... I just touched them.

445
00:39:09,278 --> 00:39:11,397
So now, do you want
to treat them?

446
00:39:17,392 --> 00:39:18,917
You wait,
I will check.

447
00:39:20,238 --> 00:39:20,924
Careful...

448
00:39:31,137 --> 00:39:33,677
Oh! there she is...
back to stare at my moustache.

449
00:39:34,717 --> 00:39:35,397
What is it?

450
00:39:35,797 --> 00:39:36,797
I have got some
spices for you.

451
00:39:36,936 --> 00:39:37,597
So?

452
00:39:37,943 --> 00:39:41,437
Earlier when we met at my shop,
we had some misunderstanding.

453
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:42,557
Did we?

454
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:44,557
Also, I soiled your uniform.

455
00:39:46,012 --> 00:39:47,277
Oh uniform?

456
00:39:47,357 --> 00:39:51,317
So I decided to get some
special spices for the special cop.

457
00:39:51,506 --> 00:39:52,117
Come on in...

458
00:39:52,812 --> 00:39:54,004
This indeed is your
special cop's home...!

459
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,096
You never mentioned anything
about this babe.

460
00:40:03,256 --> 00:40:03,976
Who are you talking about?

461
00:40:04,056 --> 00:40:04,936
The spices girl.

462
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,016
She is waiting outside.

463
00:40:06,096 --> 00:40:06,776
Oh!

464
00:40:07,256 --> 00:40:10,132
You were never so
thrilled to see me...

465
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:17,736
Hi there...

466
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,696
You changed so soon?

467
00:40:21,911 --> 00:40:22,576
What?

468
00:40:23,136 --> 00:40:24,136
I mean your clothes...

469
00:40:27,336 --> 00:40:32,016
I felt little awkward to wear
such clothes in front of a lady.

470
00:40:32,543 --> 00:40:34,216
It looked so good on you.

471
00:40:35,056 --> 00:40:36,016
You feel so?

472
00:40:37,456 --> 00:40:40,136
I couldn't get your
face out of my head.

473
00:40:40,576 --> 00:40:43,836
What amazing
stunt you performed.

474
00:40:44,721 --> 00:40:48,056
And your masculine moustache
spiced it all up so well.

475
00:40:48,855 --> 00:40:50,776
Will you please twirl your
moustache once for me?

476
00:40:53,959 --> 00:40:56,256
We are not supposed
to twirl moustache at night...

477
00:40:56,799 --> 00:40:57,776
...it results in hair fall.

478
00:40:58,416 --> 00:40:59,216
Oh, is it so?

479
00:40:59,296 --> 00:40:59,856
Yes!

480
00:41:00,496 --> 00:41:01,176
Okay!

481
00:41:05,576 --> 00:41:07,016
Also, I wanted to tell you...

482
00:41:08,576 --> 00:41:11,416
I pounded you in front of
everyone, for no reason.

483
00:41:11,856 --> 00:41:14,696
Now you are used
to pound spices, so that's fine.

484
00:41:16,256 --> 00:41:17,216
No, nothing like that...

485
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:18,856
I thought you are like 'Goda
Masala' (Maharashtrian spice blend)

486
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:21,016
But you turned out like
'Kala Masala'.(Hot and spicy blend)

487
00:41:23,216 --> 00:41:24,616
Oh! what's the difference?

488
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:25,856
You find it out.

489
00:41:29,456 --> 00:41:31,296
When I saw you
fight in the market.

490
00:41:31,536 --> 00:41:33,936
It was like I discovered
something special in a coal mine...

491
00:41:34,616 --> 00:41:37,056
I have never been
to a coal mine.

492
00:41:38,824 --> 00:41:41,096
I meant, it was like discovering
a diamond in a coal mine.

493
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:44,176
It was like spotting a lone
tiger amidst pack of wolves.

494
00:41:49,536 --> 00:41:51,616
That was my pressure
cooker, I guess.

495
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,176
Do let me know
if you need more.

496
00:42:07,096 --> 00:42:07,856
Spices I meant...

497
00:42:17,016 --> 00:42:18,776
I saw a spark
in her eyes...

498
00:42:19,056 --> 00:42:20,216
She called me a 'Tiger'...

499
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:21,416
She doesn't know...
there are two tigers...

500
00:42:21,496 --> 00:42:23,056
one that eats grass...

501
00:42:23,296 --> 00:42:24,896
...and the one that hunts.

502
00:42:32,494 --> 00:42:33,134
Greetings!

503
00:42:44,934 --> 00:42:45,654
Hello sir!

504
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:46,734
What can I do for you?

505
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,574
Oh! you are quite injured.

506
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,374
Sir, you've bashed us...

507
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,094
Didn't I just touch you?

508
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:54,374
Okay!

509
00:42:55,174 --> 00:42:56,854
Sometimes I lose my cool,
in a fit of rage

510
00:42:57,134 --> 00:42:57,814
It's perfectly fine.

511
00:42:59,614 --> 00:43:00,294
Okay...

512
00:43:00,614 --> 00:43:01,734
Tell me your names.

513
00:43:01,814 --> 00:43:02,654
Note it down!

514
00:43:09,494 --> 00:43:11,374
Dharmaraj alias Nana Londhe.

515
00:43:23,042 --> 00:43:26,654
I have been living in this
village since last 15 years.

516
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:30,374
My network is spread
across this region.

517
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:33,614
My business is not mere
a business, its my pride...

518
00:43:40,014 --> 00:43:42,214
If someone attempts
to ruin my reputation,

519
00:43:42,694 --> 00:43:44,911
I will not hesitate
to kill that person.

520
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:51,974
I am here to meet the boss.

521
00:44:01,714 --> 00:44:02,134
Take your seat...

522
00:44:05,232 --> 00:44:06,014
Give me the phone.

523
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:13,734
I can't accept gifts...

524
00:44:13,814 --> 00:44:15,242
It's for your official work...

525
00:44:19,242 --> 00:44:21,814
So you get proper mobile
network in my area.

526
00:44:28,454 --> 00:44:29,414
Samba...

527
00:44:30,894 --> 00:44:32,774
He is my dog...

528
00:44:34,014 --> 00:44:35,654
Who did he
bite the other day?

529
00:44:35,734 --> 00:44:36,934
- It was me...
- Yeah...

530
00:44:38,734 --> 00:44:41,254
Sometimes he feels he owns
the house that he guards...

531
00:44:42,094 --> 00:44:43,054
That's when...

532
00:44:44,188 --> 00:44:46,574
We cover his face
with a black cloth,

533
00:44:46,654 --> 00:44:48,654
tie him to our vehicle and...

534
00:44:50,422 --> 00:44:51,574
drag him all around the village.

535
00:44:53,445 --> 00:44:54,934
It almost kills him...

536
00:44:56,192 --> 00:45:00,054
But he should know,
he is just a watch dog...

537
00:45:01,854 --> 00:45:03,214
He shouldn't act
like the owner.

538
00:45:08,193 --> 00:45:08,975
Keep it there...

539
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,814
This is my 'Kaapur' village.

540
00:45:22,748 --> 00:45:23,614
These are my liquor dens,

541
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:27,871
This here is my
water-tanker business...

542
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:31,934
Land development...

543
00:45:34,894 --> 00:45:35,814
Here... on this land...

544
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:38,014
I will be setting up
the first distillery.

545
00:45:39,764 --> 00:45:41,134
The first one in this region.

546
00:45:43,943 --> 00:45:45,574
All of these belong to me.

547
00:45:46,848 --> 00:45:48,716
You are here to just guard it...

548
00:45:49,454 --> 00:45:50,694
I will rule it...

549
00:45:53,082 --> 00:45:54,014
So stay in your limits.

550
00:46:03,054 --> 00:46:06,014
Tupe, if he claims all
of these to be under him...

551
00:46:06,824 --> 00:46:07,931
What area comes under
our jurisdiction?

552
00:46:10,588 --> 00:46:11,214
It's simple

553
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:14,094
from this table to our main gate.

554
00:46:26,254 --> 00:46:29,654
Tupe says, this village
is Nana's homeground...

555
00:46:31,294 --> 00:46:36,294
I expected this to be a quiet
village when I was transferred here.

556
00:46:37,254 --> 00:46:40,254
Silence in the woods...

557
00:46:40,694 --> 00:46:44,854
means there are dangerous
beasts dwelling inside.

558
00:46:45,347 --> 00:46:46,614
We don't have to worry...

559
00:46:47,197 --> 00:46:48,894
In two years I will be
Transferred out of this place.

560
00:47:00,681 --> 00:47:01,934
You haven't changed a bit...

561
00:47:02,574 --> 00:47:04,734
You still can't tolerate
any crease on your uniform.

562
00:47:07,054 --> 00:47:10,214
No cop can tolerate any
crease on his uniform.

563
00:47:15,814 --> 00:47:18,769
Then how do you tolerate
such injustice in this village?

564
00:47:19,894 --> 00:47:20,894
Mr.Deshmukh...

565
00:47:21,211 --> 00:47:23,254
Let me do a round of this village...

566
00:47:23,894 --> 00:47:27,294
I want to see to what extent
Can this beast go to.

567
00:47:40,202 --> 00:47:41,104
Sir, did you recognise me?

568
00:47:41,184 --> 00:47:42,204
Hello sir!

569
00:47:43,676 --> 00:47:45,214
I met you when you
First came to this village?

570
00:47:45,574 --> 00:47:47,694
Why the hell is he
trying to get so close?

571
00:47:47,814 --> 00:47:50,254
Sir please keep
me with you...

572
00:47:50,374 --> 00:47:52,974
Hey... I don't have
any such vices.

573
00:47:53,934 --> 00:47:56,094
Sir, please hear me out.

574
00:47:56,174 --> 00:47:58,094
I wanted to be a
real cop like you...

575
00:47:58,294 --> 00:47:59,774
But I ended up becoming
a fake constable.

576
00:48:00,054 --> 00:48:02,974
Yesterday, after seeing you
bash up the goons.

577
00:48:03,345 --> 00:48:04,894
I felt, if an outsider like you
is protecting this village.

578
00:48:04,974 --> 00:48:06,894
Let me at least be
of some assistance to you.

579
00:48:07,014 --> 00:48:08,134
I can be your informer.

580
00:48:08,214 --> 00:48:09,054
Please accept my services.

581
00:48:09,365 --> 00:48:09,974
If not a constable,

582
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:11,014
at least hire me as
a 'Commissioner of police'.

583
00:48:11,094 --> 00:48:11,614
Is it?

584
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:13,214
and should I
twiddle my thumb?

585
00:48:15,137 --> 00:48:17,094
Listen to me please.

586
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:18,854
You straightened Nana's
water-tanker gang.

587
00:48:18,934 --> 00:48:20,214
that is commendable.

588
00:48:20,414 --> 00:48:21,854
Now people of this village
Get water frequently.

589
00:48:21,998 --> 00:48:25,294
But I will respect you more,
if you put an end to this mess.

590
00:48:25,574 --> 00:48:26,414
What are you talking about?

591
00:48:36,014 --> 00:48:37,894
A liquor shop in
front of the temple?

592
00:48:38,321 --> 00:48:41,054
Nana's illegal empire
is connected to this place.

593
00:48:42,073 --> 00:48:44,454
He was a small-time
goon in Pandharpur.

594
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:48,254
He worked for a liquor seller
and was very short-tempered.

595
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:52,294
One day he killed his boss and falsely
implicated his friend in the crime.

596
00:48:52,694 --> 00:48:55,574
And moved in here with all his loot.

597
00:48:55,941 --> 00:48:57,734
He started his liquor shop,

598
00:48:58,134 --> 00:49:00,254
right in front of our temple.

599
00:49:01,614 --> 00:49:03,414
This infuriated the local boys.

600
00:49:04,121 --> 00:49:08,351
Shantai's son Dinu and his
friends shattered Nana's shop.

601
00:49:15,221 --> 00:49:17,414
In the brawl Dinu
slashed Nana's face.

602
00:49:19,854 --> 00:49:21,654
But Nana's ego was hurt.

603
00:49:23,374 --> 00:49:26,614
That same here the villagers had
Decided to reinstate the village deity.

604
00:49:28,793 --> 00:49:30,393
While lighting the lamp-tower,

605
00:49:30,473 --> 00:49:33,017
Nana hacked Dinu to death,
in front of everyone.

606
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,454
Shantai saw her son die
Right in front of her eyes.

607
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:47,174
Nana warned the entire village...

608
00:49:47,361 --> 00:49:49,545
If anyone attempts to light even
a single lamp of the lamp-tower.

609
00:49:49,625 --> 00:49:51,254
The entire village
will be set on fire.

610
00:49:52,601 --> 00:49:54,294
The temple has been
shut since then.

611
00:49:54,881 --> 00:49:56,174
Our deity is banished
outside the temple.

612
00:49:58,521 --> 00:49:59,854
And every villager here is in fear.

613
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:07,574
After Dinu's death,
Shantai vowed,

614
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:14,174
That she will never enter the temple,
Until God decides to come and end this evil.

615
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:17,921
That's why she makes one garland everyday
Waiting for her Lord to arrive.

616
00:50:19,854 --> 00:50:22,014
The entire village was
Thrown into darkness by Nana...

617
00:50:23,014 --> 00:50:27,242
But she is the only flame
of hope, Burning..

618
00:50:29,424 --> 00:50:30,250
Right outside this temple.

619
00:50:37,054 --> 00:50:42,214
We are so fortunate
to have you in this village.

620
00:50:47,332 --> 00:50:48,621
Hence I urge you,

621
00:50:49,492 --> 00:50:51,658
to ban Nana's illegal activities.

622
00:50:53,758 --> 00:50:55,721
And clear this mess.

623
00:51:01,374 --> 00:51:03,854
Your duty is about to begin...

624
00:51:06,614 --> 00:51:08,734
I came here to
help my brother...

625
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:12,414
But I am going stay
back for the village.

626
00:51:37,226 --> 00:51:38,164
Sir,

627
00:51:42,864 --> 00:51:46,534
what are you doing here?

628
00:51:47,014 --> 00:51:49,134
Just... I came to
attend the fair.

629
00:51:49,934 --> 00:51:50,814
Oh, is it?

630
00:51:52,254 --> 00:51:53,094
Sir,

631
00:51:53,935 --> 00:51:55,934
Mr. Dharma Pawar... Please don't.

632
00:51:56,494 --> 00:51:58,574
I think you are the only
one who treats a farmer with respect.

633
00:51:59,934 --> 00:52:01,494
I heard about the
fight in the market.

634
00:52:02,174 --> 00:52:03,854
You have come like our god,
our savior.

635
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:06,875
God? No...

636
00:52:07,075 --> 00:52:08,419
let me be a
simple human being.

637
00:52:08,851 --> 00:52:10,094
Is everything alright with you?

638
00:52:11,614 --> 00:52:13,254
I had saved some money
to buy fertilizers,

639
00:52:13,374 --> 00:52:14,574
I had to use that for
my medical expense.

640
00:52:14,899 --> 00:52:19,854
But that's ok.
What you did boosted my morale.

641
00:52:22,214 --> 00:52:27,054
From now on you have our house
That you can call home in this village

642
00:52:29,894 --> 00:52:31,294
May I take your leave?

643
00:52:43,214 --> 00:52:43,883
Let's go.

644
00:52:43,963 --> 00:52:45,835
Is there anyone who
can hit the bulls-eye?

645
00:52:46,003 --> 00:52:47,094
Three rounds
for just 10 rupees.

646
00:52:47,174 --> 00:52:49,414
Is there anyone who
can hit the bulls-eye?

647
00:52:49,574 --> 00:52:50,294
Come!

648
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:51,414
Now!

649
00:52:51,974 --> 00:52:53,214
I am sure you
are an expert at this.

650
00:52:53,294 --> 00:52:54,214
Hey, give it to him.

651
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:56,694
He will hit the bulls eye in one go.

652
00:52:56,774 --> 00:52:57,694
No!

653
00:53:02,134 --> 00:53:05,174
I heard about Nana's
visit at the police station.

654
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:08,626
But... what was the purpose?

655
00:53:08,814 --> 00:53:09,934
What did he say?

656
00:53:12,054 --> 00:53:16,574
He apologized for his mistakes.

657
00:53:17,574 --> 00:53:20,934
He must've sensed your strength.

658
00:53:26,526 --> 00:53:29,974
Our bullets are bigger may
be that's why I am unable to.

659
00:53:30,134 --> 00:53:31,074
Here... take it.

660
00:53:31,154 --> 00:53:33,174
Go for another round please.

661
00:53:33,254 --> 00:53:34,294
Hey reload the gun.

662
00:53:34,454 --> 00:53:35,934
No, I feel you
should let it go.

663
00:53:36,134 --> 00:53:37,454
You don't even have to pay me.

664
00:53:37,694 --> 00:53:39,214
Hey shut-up and reload.

665
00:53:39,294 --> 00:53:40,225
Okay!

666
00:53:40,305 --> 00:53:41,654
Sir, try one more time.

667
00:53:41,734 --> 00:53:42,614
Here, sir...

668
00:53:43,014 --> 00:53:43,894
Please.

669
00:53:44,556 --> 00:53:45,873
Hit the balloons please.

670
00:53:52,574 --> 00:53:57,614
Earlier, I called you 'corrupt',
that triggered you, right?

671
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,494
Tell me the truth.

672
00:54:07,214 --> 00:54:09,054
Did my words have that impact on you?

673
00:54:12,134 --> 00:54:13,134
Tell me...

674
00:54:16,815 --> 00:54:17,487
Tell me...

675
00:54:18,647 --> 00:54:19,079
Oh God!

676
00:54:22,908 --> 00:54:24,014
Perfect aim!

677
00:54:31,654 --> 00:54:32,887
Very impressive.

678
00:54:57,807 --> 00:55:01,494
"Be bold and come to
me dashingly."

679
00:55:01,655 --> 00:55:05,294
"Come over to my place
dressed like a groom."

680
00:55:05,454 --> 00:55:09,614
"Go on your knees and
propose to me, oh my love."

681
00:55:20,294 --> 00:55:24,031
"I will surely come,
and surprise you."

682
00:55:24,183 --> 00:55:27,734
"...and propose to you
at your doorstep."

683
00:55:27,814 --> 00:55:32,271
"When I do so, do get a
bit shy and coy, my dear."

684
00:56:27,534 --> 00:56:31,414
"This grace of yours,
I have never seen..."

685
00:56:31,614 --> 00:56:35,054
"and I get lost in
this beautiful moment."

686
00:56:35,454 --> 00:56:38,814
"I don't care
about the world."

687
00:56:39,054 --> 00:56:42,534
"When I lose myself
in the beauty of your eyes."

688
00:56:42,755 --> 00:56:45,654
"Don't give the
same old excuses."

689
00:56:45,814 --> 00:56:50,085
"Get lost, I don't
want to hear it again."

690
00:56:50,305 --> 00:56:53,454
"I have fallen head
over heels for you."

691
00:56:53,534 --> 00:56:57,814
"So don't let me
yearn for you more."

692
00:57:19,177 --> 00:57:20,537
Hey, unload it...

693
00:57:23,103 --> 00:57:24,297
Kadaknath reporting sir...

694
00:57:24,417 --> 00:57:25,217
Yeah... tell me.

695
00:57:25,737 --> 00:57:26,497
The consignment
has reached here.

696
00:57:26,715 --> 00:57:27,377
So what do I do?

697
00:57:27,457 --> 00:57:29,937
Sir, you wanted me to
inform you about it.

698
00:57:30,057 --> 00:57:30,577
What?

699
00:57:31,017 --> 00:57:31,760
When did I say that?

700
00:57:31,953 --> 00:57:35,257
Sir, please recollect...

701
00:57:35,457 --> 00:57:36,097
Oh! Yeah...

702
00:57:36,177 --> 00:57:37,777
I did mention that to you.

703
00:57:38,065 --> 00:57:39,657
So where do I come?

704
00:57:39,961 --> 00:57:41,217
To the temple lane, sir.

705
00:57:41,337 --> 00:57:43,185
Okay... you wait for me.

706
00:57:43,265 --> 00:57:45,577
- I will be there soon.
- Yes sir, over and out...

707
00:57:48,601 --> 00:57:49,497
You all wait here...

708
00:57:49,777 --> 00:57:50,868
I will handle it alone.

709
00:58:01,977 --> 00:58:02,817
Good you confiscated this vehicle.

710
00:58:03,017 --> 00:58:03,697
Yes of course...

711
00:58:06,137 --> 00:58:08,057
This is the only way
to recover from the defaulters.

712
00:58:08,495 --> 00:58:09,217
It's quite simple...

713
00:58:09,297 --> 00:58:10,926
Okay let's get a garland...

714
00:58:18,737 --> 00:58:19,537
Do not touch my garland,
keep it back.

715
00:58:19,617 --> 00:58:21,017
Leave my hand, you old hag.

716
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:22,577
Don't you understand?

717
00:58:22,737 --> 00:58:23,377
I said put it back...

718
00:58:23,457 --> 00:58:25,417
- Just let me go, you old hag.
- Put it back.

719
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:30,937
Aren't you ashamed of yourself,
to misbehave with an old lady...

720
00:58:31,121 --> 00:58:33,257
How dare you touch me,
nobody touches this 'Bhairavnath'.

721
00:58:33,857 --> 00:58:36,217
Hey... what are you
guys waiting for?

722
00:58:36,523 --> 00:58:39,217
Smash this shop to pieces.

723
00:58:51,777 --> 00:58:54,617
I am going to shove each one of you,
like a sugar cane into this grinder...

724
00:58:54,857 --> 00:58:57,436
And pull your pulp
out from the other end.

725
00:59:19,617 --> 00:59:21,897
Hey, take down my order...

726
00:59:22,577 --> 00:59:23,577
One full glass,

727
00:59:23,777 --> 00:59:24,777
one half...

728
00:59:25,017 --> 00:59:26,137
one jumbo...

729
00:59:26,617 --> 00:59:28,097
and one with
ice in it.

730
01:00:28,177 --> 01:00:29,377
Oh Lord Vithal...

731
01:00:30,832 --> 01:00:32,777
I waited for you
all these years...

732
01:00:34,096 --> 01:00:35,377
Here you are...

733
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,177
And in this form...

734
01:00:39,816 --> 01:00:41,017
Oh Lord...

735
01:00:45,457 --> 01:00:46,857
Go and tell everyone.

736
01:00:47,457 --> 01:00:50,177
Liquor is banned
from now on in this village.

737
01:00:50,577 --> 01:00:52,944
I swear I will ban
liquor in the entire region.

738
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:55,577
I, Mauli Sarjerao Deshmukh
swear by my words.

739
01:00:55,944 --> 01:00:57,857
I will reinstate our
Lord back in his temple.

740
01:00:58,097 --> 01:01:01,497
If someone has the guts
to stop me, they can try their might.

741
01:01:04,617 --> 01:01:05,217
Nana...

742
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:06,457
Nana...

743
01:01:06,904 --> 01:01:07,817
There is a problem...

744
01:01:08,688 --> 01:01:11,057
The inspector has
shut our liquor shop.

745
01:01:12,656 --> 01:01:14,137
He has confiscated
our possessions.

746
01:01:16,736 --> 01:01:18,857
He shut our shop
in front of everyone.

747
01:01:19,457 --> 01:01:20,937
And he re-opened
the temple doors.

748
01:01:22,664 --> 01:01:24,057
He will ban liquor
is what he said.

749
01:01:26,337 --> 01:01:28,817
He has announced
to reinstate the deity.

750
01:01:32,376 --> 01:01:34,057
I underestimated his might...

751
01:01:34,137 --> 01:01:35,777
He proved me wrong.

752
01:01:36,737 --> 01:01:39,657
Now to get a
grip on villagers,

753
01:01:40,097 --> 01:01:42,657
we need to set an
example in front of them.

754
01:01:43,017 --> 01:01:44,577
Why don't you
slaughter him now?

755
01:01:45,497 --> 01:01:46,457
Not now...

756
01:01:48,497 --> 01:01:50,057
I will do it in
front of everyone.

757
01:01:51,617 --> 01:01:55,857
The thrill to flash our power...

758
01:01:57,137 --> 01:01:59,377
...in front of the entire village...

759
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:02,297
Has its own kick.

760
01:02:11,073 --> 01:02:11,737
Wow...

761
01:02:12,136 --> 01:02:13,017
it's beautiful.

762
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:15,919
People say that,

763
01:02:15,999 --> 01:02:17,497
a divine person like you,

764
01:02:17,577 --> 01:02:19,577
can transform every
village into 'Pandharpur'(Holy place).

765
01:02:21,417 --> 01:02:22,137
Oh!

766
01:02:24,217 --> 01:02:25,017
Renuka...

767
01:02:25,657 --> 01:02:27,777
I have something to confess...

768
01:02:29,177 --> 01:02:30,337
Please tell me.

769
01:02:31,847 --> 01:02:32,497
No...

770
01:02:32,695 --> 01:02:33,617
Sister...

771
01:02:33,737 --> 01:02:34,457
Yes...

772
01:02:35,751 --> 01:02:37,457
Let me explain.

773
01:02:38,977 --> 01:02:40,297
Once you reinstate our deity...

774
01:02:41,497 --> 01:02:43,377
you will become
a public figure...

775
01:02:43,583 --> 01:02:45,057
you will get busy
with all social activities.

776
01:02:45,215 --> 01:02:48,177
We will lose contact
owing to your busy schedule.

777
01:02:49,575 --> 01:02:50,377
Very impressive...

778
01:02:52,527 --> 01:02:55,017
That's why please tell me
What you have to say now,

779
01:02:55,657 --> 01:02:56,497
Mauli...

780
01:03:04,183 --> 01:03:04,977
Renuka...

781
01:03:06,577 --> 01:03:10,177
The 'Mauli', who is protecting
this village is not...

782
01:03:56,657 --> 01:03:57,617
Sir...

783
01:03:59,857 --> 01:04:02,057
here our mobiles don't
get proper network.

784
01:04:03,257 --> 01:04:04,897
And you are creating more issues
by reinstating the village deity.

785
01:04:07,305 --> 01:04:08,817
I came to remind you...

786
01:04:27,937 --> 01:04:32,937
You bashed up my
water-tanker drivers...

787
01:04:36,137 --> 01:04:37,257
You didn't stop there...

788
01:04:38,195 --> 01:04:40,017
... you bashed up
my liquor shop boys too.

789
01:04:40,337 --> 01:04:41,657
You seized my possessions...

790
01:04:47,809 --> 01:04:49,337
Banned liquor.

791
01:04:51,457 --> 01:04:53,337
And now you are planning
to reinstate the deity.

792
01:04:58,809 --> 01:05:00,617
You displayed your power...

793
01:05:01,657 --> 01:05:04,017
We can't just wait and watch.

794
01:05:05,897 --> 01:05:06,977
Hence,

795
01:05:07,897 --> 01:05:10,017
here I am to show
you a bit of my strength.

796
01:05:51,777 --> 01:05:54,617
So you wanted
to reform this village?

797
01:05:56,189 --> 01:05:59,257
Try getting up first...

798
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:25,377
Treat him like 'Samba'.

799
01:07:09,768 --> 01:07:10,617
Start it.

800
01:07:39,419 --> 01:07:40,643
Mauli...

801
01:09:05,491 --> 01:09:07,137
He is not just
my brother...

802
01:09:07,391 --> 01:09:08,977
He is my life...

803
01:09:09,191 --> 01:09:11,777
And you dared to
take my life away!

804
01:09:15,181 --> 01:09:16,017
Hey get up...

805
01:09:16,257 --> 01:09:18,017
To hell with
these local goons.

806
01:09:20,177 --> 01:09:22,777
Having a few dogs around
doesn't make him any powerful.

807
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:26,097
Remember...
they can break our bones...

808
01:09:26,253 --> 01:09:28,625
But not our will...

809
01:09:36,697 --> 01:09:37,457
Get up...

810
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:41,337
Look into their
eyes and tell them...

811
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:42,777
When you stand in
front of 'Mauli'...

812
01:09:42,857 --> 01:09:43,811
bow your head down in respect.

813
01:09:43,987 --> 01:09:45,337
and shove your tails
between your legs.

814
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:44,060
Thanks for reminding
me who I am...

815
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:48,220
This local goon has hacked
you in front of these villagers.

816
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:55,260
And I have sent back your pride and
strength both to your Lord Vitthal.

817
01:10:56,764 --> 01:10:58,370
From here on,
in this village...

818
01:10:58,490 --> 01:11:02,330
'Mauli' the name,
will not evoke devotion.

819
01:11:04,132 --> 01:11:05,410
It will spread fear.

820
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:29,050
Brother...

821
01:11:30,890 --> 01:11:31,730
Brother...

822
01:11:38,188 --> 01:11:38,970
Brother...

823
01:11:40,490 --> 01:11:42,850
Brother, are you okay?

824
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:01,570
No!

825
01:13:05,174 --> 01:13:05,854
Sir,

826
01:13:07,334 --> 01:13:10,574
your loss is
very unfortunate...

827
01:13:12,374 --> 01:13:17,054
I have been praying
to the almighty...

828
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,534
... to get you out of
this situation at the earliest.

829
01:13:22,614 --> 01:13:23,494
Which God are
you talking about?

830
01:13:27,054 --> 01:13:28,934
The one I worshiped has
left me and gone forever.

831
01:13:39,094 --> 01:13:44,924
"Life is helpless, and
sky is pouring relentlessly."

832
01:13:47,046 --> 01:13:53,567
"Your door is shut, whom
should I ask for help."

833
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:58,934
"My spirit is drained,
I feel so lost."

834
01:13:59,174 --> 01:14:02,854
"I am devastated,
recovering is not possible."

835
01:14:03,214 --> 01:14:10,054
"Will you come back to me,
and eradicate this darkness?"

836
01:14:11,174 --> 01:14:17,614
"Life is helpless, and
sky is pouring relentlessly."

837
01:14:54,254 --> 01:14:56,174
Your father wanted you both...

838
01:14:56,386 --> 01:14:58,814
... to be a policeman,
just like him.

839
01:15:02,565 --> 01:15:04,790
This uniform will
protect him...

840
01:15:05,894 --> 01:15:10,374
And your father's belt is for you.

841
01:15:13,814 --> 01:15:14,694
Mother!

842
01:15:19,534 --> 01:15:20,654
Your buttons are all messed up...

843
01:15:21,574 --> 01:15:22,899
Oh gosh! Sorry.

844
01:15:27,133 --> 01:15:34,147
"Will you come back to me,
and eradicate this darkness?"

845
01:15:35,117 --> 01:15:42,235
"Life is helpless, and
sky is pouring relentlessly."

846
01:15:42,968 --> 01:15:48,935
Your door is shut, whom
should I ask for help."

847
01:16:36,054 --> 01:16:39,556
"I have lost my path..."

848
01:16:39,794 --> 01:16:43,391
"I want you back."

849
01:16:44,001 --> 01:16:47,888
"My destiny was
entwined with yours."

850
01:16:47,968 --> 01:16:50,897
"This sadness is killing me."

851
01:16:51,943 --> 01:16:59,303
"There is no one to protect me,
from this fire burning around me."

852
01:17:04,042 --> 01:17:04,774
Mother!

853
01:17:05,814 --> 01:17:06,974
You please lie down...

854
01:17:07,174 --> 01:17:10,254
"The bond is severed, only
your memories are with me."

855
01:17:10,494 --> 01:17:13,374
What's wrong
with you dear?

856
01:17:14,266 --> 01:17:15,894
Please speak to us mom...

857
01:17:16,574 --> 01:17:17,967
What's happening to you?

858
01:17:23,977 --> 01:17:25,334
Promise me,

859
01:17:26,494 --> 01:17:27,734
you both
will live like one soul.

860
01:17:28,129 --> 01:17:31,585
You will never
abandon each other... ever.

861
01:17:34,892 --> 01:17:37,816
Mauli promise me,

862
01:17:37,896 --> 01:17:46,494
...you will always
protect your brother no matter what.

863
01:17:47,374 --> 01:17:48,114
Mauli!

864
01:17:50,639 --> 01:17:51,494
Mauli!

865
01:17:52,952 --> 01:17:53,715
Mom!

866
01:17:57,954 --> 01:17:58,974
Mom!

867
01:18:13,333 --> 01:18:13,854
Sir!

868
01:18:14,534 --> 01:18:16,934
Please come in...

869
01:18:18,574 --> 01:18:19,774
I am here to warn you...

870
01:18:20,534 --> 01:18:21,294
What?

871
01:18:21,934 --> 01:18:23,574
If you don't repay
your debt in next two days...

872
01:18:24,459 --> 01:18:25,934
Your land will be seized...

873
01:18:27,974 --> 01:18:29,014
This is Nana's order...

874
01:18:29,334 --> 01:18:31,294
But why are you
playing his messenger?

875
01:18:31,462 --> 01:18:32,334
Hey...

876
01:18:33,791 --> 01:18:35,094
it's very simple...

877
01:18:35,534 --> 01:18:36,873
Sir is on our side.

878
01:18:43,974 --> 01:18:44,854
Now I know...

879
01:18:46,574 --> 01:18:47,414
Go tell Nana,

880
01:18:49,353 --> 01:18:50,854
it's not possible
to repay in two days.

881
01:18:52,344 --> 01:18:54,574
I need to reap and
sell my crop to earn money...

882
01:18:54,694 --> 01:18:55,854
I need minimum 8 to 10 days...

883
01:18:58,014 --> 01:18:58,574
I am helpless...

884
01:18:58,654 --> 01:19:00,494
I will have to forcefully
throw you out.

885
01:19:01,374 --> 01:19:02,014
Dharma!

886
01:19:04,174 --> 01:19:05,694
Please don't force
me to resort to this action.

887
01:19:06,414 --> 01:19:08,734
Okay, you go ahead...

888
01:19:09,534 --> 01:19:13,214
Let me see who
throws me out of my house.

889
01:19:14,574 --> 01:19:15,334
Get out...

890
01:19:20,614 --> 01:19:21,494
You go inside.

891
01:19:29,767 --> 01:19:30,814
Good job...

892
01:19:33,134 --> 01:19:37,974
I am glad you joined us...

893
01:19:39,654 --> 01:19:42,059
I wish you had shown
such loyalty earlier...

894
01:19:42,139 --> 01:19:44,173
Then your brother
would've been alive.

895
01:19:49,694 --> 01:19:52,774
I would like to reward
you for your loyalty.

896
01:19:58,203 --> 01:19:59,374
Here, take this...

897
01:20:01,954 --> 01:20:03,094
Please take it...

898
01:20:05,294 --> 01:20:07,574
You will need it to pay
For your brother's last rites.

899
01:20:14,894 --> 01:20:17,722
Check that out...
my picture...

900
01:20:18,699 --> 01:20:19,946
Isn't it very royal?

901
01:20:23,334 --> 01:20:25,734
This square is my homeground...

902
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:27,894
and this distillery will be like
the capital of my kingdom.

903
01:20:29,854 --> 01:20:33,334
I swear I will spread my liquor business
In the entire state, that's my promise.

904
01:21:16,494 --> 01:21:17,174
Renuka,

905
01:21:20,254 --> 01:21:21,734
I need to speak to you...

906
01:21:26,854 --> 01:21:28,054
You are too late now...

907
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:31,854
Please leave this village...

908
01:21:34,294 --> 01:21:35,854
What's the purpose
of leading such a life?

909
01:21:38,774 --> 01:21:40,294
Nana has threatened me...

910
01:21:40,614 --> 01:21:41,214
What?

911
01:21:41,894 --> 01:21:43,654
If I leave this village,

912
01:21:44,094 --> 01:21:45,414
he will not spare anyone here...

913
01:21:47,614 --> 01:21:50,094
I lost my brother while
reforming this village.

914
01:21:51,854 --> 01:21:53,254
Where do I go from here?

915
01:21:55,374 --> 01:21:56,814
So, do you intend to
go through this torture?

916
01:21:58,494 --> 01:22:00,654
I have to get used to this...

917
01:22:01,974 --> 01:22:03,054
I don't have a choice...

918
01:22:04,469 --> 01:22:06,014
Earlier I did bear it for my sake

919
01:22:07,504 --> 01:22:09,014
Now I will bear it
For this village.

920
01:22:10,382 --> 01:22:12,854
Will this self torture
do any good to this village?

921
01:22:13,774 --> 01:22:14,854
If you think so,

922
01:22:16,461 --> 01:22:18,134
then you are wrong.

923
01:22:23,472 --> 01:22:24,534
You may leave now...

924
01:22:26,782 --> 01:22:27,654
Sir!

925
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:13,054
[People wailing...]

926
01:23:37,654 --> 01:23:38,534
Uttam...

927
01:23:48,334 --> 01:23:49,534
Dharma's farm is on fire...

928
01:23:50,636 --> 01:23:51,814
I need a water-tanker urgently...

929
01:23:53,254 --> 01:23:55,128
Hey... look...

930
01:23:55,662 --> 01:23:57,984
...how desperate he is...

931
01:23:58,334 --> 01:24:00,694
I need a water-tanker
urgently to extinguish the fire.

932
01:24:02,574 --> 01:24:03,574
Do you want a tanker?

933
01:24:04,694 --> 01:24:05,859
Is this your father's
property to claim ownership?

934
01:24:05,939 --> 01:24:06,941
Get out!

935
01:24:24,924 --> 01:24:26,374
Sir, I beg of you...

936
01:24:27,854 --> 01:24:29,534
Kindly give me one water-tanker
to extinguish the fire...

937
01:24:31,374 --> 01:24:32,214
Do you want water?

938
01:24:32,334 --> 01:24:33,054
Yes!

939
01:24:33,948 --> 01:24:35,254
Hey, give it here..

940
01:24:38,694 --> 01:24:41,574
Here gulp it down...
and I will give you water...

941
01:24:42,894 --> 01:24:44,054
What are you staring at?

942
01:24:44,374 --> 01:24:47,734
God drank poison to save
People from death...

943
01:24:48,586 --> 01:24:50,214
can't you drink just
one bottle of alcohol?

944
01:24:52,294 --> 01:24:53,934
Come on, have it.

945
01:25:16,175 --> 01:25:16,974
Have it.

946
01:25:28,433 --> 01:25:30,654
You can do it...

947
01:25:32,254 --> 01:25:33,254
Have it...

948
01:25:43,774 --> 01:25:45,854
Bottoms up...

949
01:25:45,934 --> 01:25:47,897
You have to finish it up.

950
01:25:57,828 --> 01:26:00,494
That's nice...

951
01:26:17,414 --> 01:26:18,494
Give him some water.

952
01:26:30,654 --> 01:26:31,614
Hey...

953
01:26:34,294 --> 01:26:35,414
We are the one
to set the fire,

954
01:26:35,494 --> 01:26:37,014
how can you come to
us asking for water?

955
01:26:37,214 --> 01:26:38,374
Have you lost it?

956
01:26:41,572 --> 01:26:42,174
Here, take this...

957
01:26:46,894 --> 01:26:48,334
Go extinguish the fire...

958
01:28:52,294 --> 01:28:54,494
I thought you are omnipresent.

959
01:28:56,574 --> 01:29:00,214
I thought I will find you here.

960
01:29:02,654 --> 01:29:03,974
So, I came here
looking for you.

961
01:29:06,574 --> 01:29:10,294
I have worshiped
you all my life...

962
01:29:11,479 --> 01:29:13,854
Today, I need an
answer from you...

963
01:29:17,302 --> 01:29:20,134
Every single person in that
village thinks...

964
01:29:20,654 --> 01:29:22,894
You are here
inside their temple..

965
01:29:25,201 --> 01:29:27,974
They struggled for over 15
years to re-open that temple door.

966
01:29:29,134 --> 01:29:30,494
And gave their life for it.

967
01:29:35,254 --> 01:29:36,334
Now I feel...

968
01:29:38,094 --> 01:29:41,574
... it's good your temple
doors were never opened.

969
01:29:42,534 --> 01:29:44,214
They would've discovered...

970
01:29:46,654 --> 01:29:52,214
...your non-existence.

971
01:29:53,814 --> 01:29:55,734
You give with one hand...

972
01:29:58,854 --> 01:30:01,014
And take away from the other...

973
01:30:02,054 --> 01:30:07,334
You took away my father...

974
01:30:07,774 --> 01:30:08,734
You gave me my mother...

975
01:30:09,174 --> 01:30:10,174
Then you took away my mother...

976
01:30:10,334 --> 01:30:11,174
And you gave me a brother...

977
01:30:11,614 --> 01:30:13,418
When I needed him the most,

978
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:15,890
you snatched him away...

979
01:30:25,534 --> 01:30:27,534
You never gave me
the strength to fight...

980
01:30:28,694 --> 01:30:30,814
You also took away my spirit to
face difficult situations.

981
01:30:31,494 --> 01:30:34,534
Every insect and bird is blessed with
an instinct to protect themselves...

982
01:30:35,196 --> 01:30:38,814
Why have you not
given me any strength?

983
01:30:46,574 --> 01:30:51,534
I am here to tell you...

984
01:30:52,334 --> 01:30:53,894
Your temple may
stand here forever...

985
01:30:54,105 --> 01:30:56,374
But no one will ever believe in
you from hereon.

986
01:30:57,254 --> 01:31:00,214
I have lost everything I had...

987
01:31:01,734 --> 01:31:03,974
There is only darkness
That's left behind.

988
01:31:05,739 --> 01:31:10,134
How do we live in this darkness?

989
01:31:13,014 --> 01:31:14,294
Can you please tell me?

990
01:32:07,734 --> 01:32:10,326
Brother!

991
01:32:16,414 --> 01:32:17,574
Sir,

992
01:32:18,254 --> 01:32:21,494
some villager spotted
you entering the temple.

993
01:32:24,854 --> 01:32:27,134
To protect you from Nana's goons...

994
01:32:29,134 --> 01:32:30,934
...I had to bring you here.

995
01:33:35,254 --> 01:33:38,449
How many more dead
do you want to see?

996
01:33:38,769 --> 01:33:42,129
Do you think your silence
will safeguard this village?

997
01:33:42,497 --> 01:33:43,777
This is the result
of you keeping quiet.

998
01:33:44,271 --> 01:33:46,573
Remaining silent is
not going to help anyone.

999
01:33:47,687 --> 01:33:51,289
Everyone knows the real
mind behind the fire breakout.

1000
01:33:51,868 --> 01:33:53,409
I wish to remind you that,

1001
01:33:53,777 --> 01:33:55,776
you too are responsible for this.

1002
01:33:58,446 --> 01:34:00,089
And you will have to
Pay for it one day.

1003
01:34:30,339 --> 01:34:32,114
Keep moving...

1004
01:34:33,656 --> 01:34:35,447
Keep moving...

1005
01:34:37,135 --> 01:34:39,190
Hey show me the money...

1006
01:34:51,751 --> 01:34:53,662
You are responsible for
the fire at Dharma Pawar's field...

1007
01:34:54,073 --> 01:34:55,609
You confessed yesterday...

1008
01:34:55,782 --> 01:34:58,609
Of course... I did...

1009
01:34:59,013 --> 01:35:00,854
What the hell are
you going to do about it?

1010
01:35:01,206 --> 01:35:02,498
Get out of here...

1011
01:35:04,475 --> 01:35:06,431
You idiot!

1012
01:35:16,264 --> 01:35:18,307
Hey, throw him out of here...

1013
01:35:41,437 --> 01:35:42,049
You go...

1014
01:35:42,129 --> 01:35:43,206
I will handle him.

1015
01:36:25,873 --> 01:36:27,056
Mr. Deshmukh...

1016
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:29,303
You are out to
ruin my reputation.

1017
01:36:29,856 --> 01:36:32,216
Your fists are not meant
to just crush onions?

1018
01:36:34,073 --> 01:36:35,336
Time to show your strenght.

1019
01:36:35,533 --> 01:36:37,136
Looks like he is still high
from yesterday's drinking...

1020
01:36:37,296 --> 01:36:40,829
Hey, give him a dose...

1021
01:37:57,711 --> 01:38:01,016
There is not a single brick
on earth that can hurt 'Mauli'.

1022
01:39:12,676 --> 01:39:13,387
Come...

1023
01:39:13,815 --> 01:39:15,747
Hey leave me...

1024
01:39:15,987 --> 01:39:18,324
Let me go...

1025
01:39:23,267 --> 01:39:25,775
Hey, have you lost it?

1026
01:39:27,547 --> 01:39:29,507
Do you know who you
are dealing with?

1027
01:39:30,227 --> 01:39:32,281
Have you lost your mind?

1028
01:39:52,747 --> 01:39:53,907
Hey what are you
doing inside?

1029
01:39:54,896 --> 01:39:56,433
Hey you locked me up here...

1030
01:39:58,347 --> 01:39:59,156
Brother...

1031
01:40:06,387 --> 01:40:08,027
Hey what are you
Doing there?

1032
01:40:08,467 --> 01:40:12,347
Sir, of course I will enter
from the door, and not the window.

1033
01:40:23,627 --> 01:40:25,067
So, Mr. Deshmukh...

1034
01:40:31,893 --> 01:40:34,627
As kids I used to seek you.

1035
01:40:35,065 --> 01:40:37,347
Now you know
where I am hiding,

1036
01:40:37,987 --> 01:40:39,147
yet you fail to know where I am...

1037
01:41:04,387 --> 01:41:05,667
There you are...

1038
01:41:06,980 --> 01:41:08,747
Brother, what is going on?

1039
01:41:09,387 --> 01:41:12,227
How did you come back?

1040
01:41:13,187 --> 01:41:14,227
Please speak up!

1041
01:41:15,675 --> 01:41:17,307
I had given my
word to our mother...

1042
01:41:17,867 --> 01:41:22,027
To protect you always,
so here I am.

1043
01:41:24,307 --> 01:41:25,747
What is this?

1044
01:41:27,150 --> 01:41:27,947
Magic...

1045
01:41:29,425 --> 01:41:30,307
or an illusion?

1046
01:41:30,867 --> 01:41:32,387
Consider this an association,

1047
01:41:32,467 --> 01:41:33,307
that's all...

1048
01:41:34,707 --> 01:41:37,347
How did I fight them?

1049
01:41:38,128 --> 01:41:39,827
I don't have the
strength to do so.

1050
01:41:40,187 --> 01:41:42,947
Wood is never aware
of it's capacity.

1051
01:41:43,067 --> 01:41:44,427
Till a small spark can
sets it on fire.

1052
01:41:45,107 --> 01:41:46,787
You have my spark in you...

1053
01:41:47,038 --> 01:41:48,467
Today, you showed it ...

1054
01:41:49,085 --> 01:41:50,347
All I know is,

1055
01:41:50,667 --> 01:41:51,947
you saved me today.

1056
01:41:52,285 --> 01:41:54,107
I would've got crushed
under the bricks.

1057
01:41:54,867 --> 01:41:56,467
I wanted to tell you much earlier...
Mr. Deshmukh...

1058
01:41:56,747 --> 01:42:00,907
But since we were busy fighting,
there was no time for dialogues.

1059
01:42:01,422 --> 01:42:02,547
You saved me this time...

1060
01:42:03,089 --> 01:42:03,867
What about the future?

1061
01:42:04,307 --> 01:42:06,027
We fought them with our fists...

1062
01:42:06,547 --> 01:42:07,827
Now its' time to use our heads.

1063
01:42:09,427 --> 01:42:10,187
What do you mean?

1064
01:42:10,377 --> 01:42:11,467
We got Bhairavnath today...

1065
01:42:11,547 --> 01:42:12,747
Half the battle is won...

1066
01:42:13,227 --> 01:42:14,329
Rest...

1067
01:42:20,947 --> 01:42:21,707
Brother...

1068
01:42:23,667 --> 01:42:24,747
I hope you are with me.

1069
01:42:26,507 --> 01:42:27,787
If you believe in me...

1070
01:42:28,867 --> 01:42:29,787
I will always be there with you.

1071
01:42:40,387 --> 01:42:41,267
Hey, get up...

1072
01:42:45,387 --> 01:42:47,067
Let me explain...

1073
01:42:47,707 --> 01:42:49,187
I will ask you to confess,

1074
01:42:49,547 --> 01:42:50,667
You will deny...

1075
01:42:51,067 --> 01:42:52,067
Nana will come to your rescue...

1076
01:42:52,267 --> 01:42:53,547
And I will have to let you go.

1077
01:42:54,187 --> 01:42:55,867
Nothing of that sort
will happen now...

1078
01:42:56,227 --> 01:42:57,907
I have spent 6 years
now doing this duty.

1079
01:42:58,467 --> 01:43:00,427
It's finally time to use my
service revolver.

1080
01:43:00,606 --> 01:43:01,547
Hey...

1081
01:43:01,707 --> 01:43:02,539
Come out...

1082
01:43:03,828 --> 01:43:05,147
Hey Tupe!

1083
01:43:05,227 --> 01:43:05,987
Hey Tupe!

1084
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:09,547
I will shoot you right
in the middle of the village.

1085
01:43:10,547 --> 01:43:11,427
Get inside!

1086
01:43:12,027 --> 01:43:14,347
Have you lost it?

1087
01:43:16,947 --> 01:43:18,467
Hey... what are you up to?

1088
01:43:19,667 --> 01:43:20,547
Let's discuss...

1089
01:43:24,787 --> 01:43:27,067
Hey Tupe...

1090
01:43:41,351 --> 01:43:41,947
Get down.

1091
01:43:52,846 --> 01:43:54,267
Are you planning
to kill me here?

1092
01:43:54,467 --> 01:43:56,427
Sir, have you lost it?

1093
01:43:57,182 --> 01:43:59,267
How can I dare to kill you?

1094
01:43:59,347 --> 01:44:00,827
So why did you
get me here?

1095
01:44:01,067 --> 01:44:04,187
To clear some misunderstandings...

1096
01:44:04,707 --> 01:44:06,907
I lost my senses in a fit of rage.

1097
01:44:08,491 --> 01:44:10,187
Are you crazy?

1098
01:44:10,667 --> 01:44:16,107
I have no clue why
I behaved so weird.

1099
01:44:17,227 --> 01:44:19,147
Please be kind enough
and forgive me.

1100
01:44:20,627 --> 01:44:21,987
Okay!

1101
01:44:22,665 --> 01:44:27,467
I request you not to
inform Nana about this.

1102
01:44:27,987 --> 01:44:30,187
He will treat me
like his dog 'Samba'.

1103
01:44:31,267 --> 01:44:32,427
Please...

1104
01:44:34,267 --> 01:44:35,347
Okay...

1105
01:44:36,427 --> 01:44:37,427
I won't tell him.

1106
01:44:45,067 --> 01:44:45,787
Brother.

1107
01:44:47,667 --> 01:44:50,627
Please do not inform Nana.

1108
01:44:51,067 --> 01:44:53,947
He gets only the information
that I pass on to him.

1109
01:44:54,230 --> 01:44:55,187
It's that simple.

1110
01:44:56,595 --> 01:44:57,467
You leave now.

1111
01:45:14,026 --> 01:45:14,693
41

1112
01:45:17,453 --> 01:45:20,853
Stitch something that
will suit my pride.

1113
01:45:21,813 --> 01:45:22,613
17 and half...

1114
01:45:24,013 --> 01:45:24,813
You wanted to see me?

1115
01:45:25,253 --> 01:45:27,693
Where were you yesterday?

1116
01:45:28,213 --> 01:45:29,853
Your cell-phone
was switched off too.

1117
01:45:30,674 --> 01:45:33,093
Did you go out of
our coverage area?

1118
01:45:34,267 --> 01:45:35,533
Nothing like that.

1119
01:45:37,074 --> 01:45:37,813
Come over here.

1120
01:45:48,333 --> 01:45:50,173
That inspector had
jailed me last night.

1121
01:45:50,333 --> 01:45:51,733
Okay...Nana

1122
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:53,973
Get his measurements too.

1123
01:45:55,091 --> 01:45:56,133
Why me?

1124
01:45:56,213 --> 01:45:59,173
Let him or should I volunteer?

1125
01:45:59,741 --> 01:46:00,533
Okay go ahead.

1126
01:46:00,613 --> 01:46:03,173
You are my most trusted.

1127
01:46:06,241 --> 01:46:07,853
So why did
he arrest you?

1128
01:46:08,373 --> 01:46:09,973
There was some
misunderstanding.

1129
01:46:10,638 --> 01:46:11,853
He is a crazy guy.

1130
01:46:11,933 --> 01:46:12,933
You don't bother.

1131
01:46:15,333 --> 01:46:15,973
Still,

1132
01:46:16,173 --> 01:46:16,813
40

1133
01:46:16,933 --> 01:46:18,413
I am sure there is
something fishy.

1134
01:46:19,449 --> 01:46:20,652
Nothing sir.

1135
01:46:20,732 --> 01:46:23,333
I believe you blurted out that
we were behind the fire incident.

1136
01:46:27,285 --> 01:46:28,173
Didn't you?

1137
01:46:28,293 --> 01:46:29,013
18

1138
01:46:31,573 --> 01:46:32,533
You forced him to booze,

1139
01:46:32,613 --> 01:46:33,522
he bashed you up...

1140
01:46:33,602 --> 01:46:34,293
he jailed you...

1141
01:46:34,373 --> 01:46:35,293
only... to release you later?

1142
01:46:36,199 --> 01:46:37,013
For no reason?

1143
01:46:37,973 --> 01:46:38,453
Yeah...

1144
01:46:38,533 --> 01:46:39,813
I was confused by
his behavior too.

1145
01:46:41,037 --> 01:46:42,333
But he just let me go.

1146
01:46:42,634 --> 01:46:44,253
I swear I didn't
say anything.

1147
01:46:51,078 --> 01:46:55,533
How dare you attempt
to ruin my reputation?

1148
01:46:57,733 --> 01:46:59,533
I won't repeat it ever.

1149
01:47:01,147 --> 01:47:05,333
I will never let
you repeat it, ever.

1150
01:47:10,542 --> 01:47:11,133
Note it.

1151
01:47:13,453 --> 01:47:14,653
His neck measures 16.

1152
01:47:34,973 --> 01:47:36,093
What's that?

1153
01:47:42,279 --> 01:47:43,053
Come on in...

1154
01:47:43,853 --> 01:47:44,373
We need to go.

1155
01:47:44,453 --> 01:47:45,013
Where?

1156
01:47:45,453 --> 01:47:46,093
To the factory.

1157
01:47:46,173 --> 01:47:46,973
Nana wants to meet you.

1158
01:47:47,053 --> 01:47:50,893
He has not been receiving
my phone calls since morning.

1159
01:47:51,242 --> 01:47:53,013
Is he upset?

1160
01:47:53,093 --> 01:47:54,573
Nothing like that.

1161
01:47:54,893 --> 01:47:57,013
May be he was busy?

1162
01:47:57,093 --> 01:48:00,653
So do you think
I am sitting idle here?

1163
01:48:04,773 --> 01:48:09,533
I work for him, yet
he doesn't value my loyalty.

1164
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:11,813
You are wrong.

1165
01:48:12,013 --> 01:48:13,213
What nonsense!

1166
01:48:16,054 --> 01:48:17,133
Thupe...

1167
01:48:18,669 --> 01:48:21,293
My confessions
will ruin his empire...

1168
01:48:23,494 --> 01:48:25,813
I know him inside out.

1169
01:48:27,063 --> 01:48:28,533
Exactly, for that very reason,

1170
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:31,413
Nana felt he should
not take any risk.

1171
01:48:32,631 --> 01:48:33,333
What do you mean?

1172
01:48:45,836 --> 01:48:47,893
If you try to go against Nana,

1173
01:48:48,744 --> 01:48:50,733
you will not be spared...

1174
01:48:53,533 --> 01:48:54,653
It is as simple as that.

1175
01:49:13,997 --> 01:49:14,933
They are 8 men after him...

1176
01:49:16,213 --> 01:49:16,893
What will he do now?

1177
01:49:19,053 --> 01:49:21,373
That's the difference
between us dear.

1178
01:49:22,093 --> 01:49:23,373
You count the people,

1179
01:49:23,571 --> 01:49:25,013
I count my victims.

1180
01:49:26,502 --> 01:49:27,653
Let's go Mr. Deshmukh...

1181
01:49:28,119 --> 01:49:29,693
It's time to get physical
with them...

1182
01:49:30,395 --> 01:49:31,893
Twirl your moustache
and get ready.

1183
01:51:26,372 --> 01:51:31,173
He doubted my loyalty...

1184
01:51:34,253 --> 01:51:38,213
It's stupidity to stay
loyal to a cheater.

1185
01:51:39,270 --> 01:51:41,133
I have done
everything for him.

1186
01:51:44,893 --> 01:51:47,293
I was the one to raise
the army of men.

1187
01:51:48,148 --> 01:51:50,773
I stole the government funds and
created a Tanker lobby for him.

1188
01:51:51,886 --> 01:51:53,293
I helped him to
set up his liquor shop.

1189
01:51:54,169 --> 01:51:57,973
I also set fire to Dharma Pawar's
field to make space for his distillery.

1190
01:51:58,208 --> 01:52:00,133
You set his field on fire
and he committed suicide.

1191
01:52:00,213 --> 01:52:01,573
No he didn't commit suicide.

1192
01:52:03,453 --> 01:52:04,653
He was murdered.

1193
01:52:07,775 --> 01:52:08,773
Nana murdered him...

1194
01:52:09,213 --> 01:52:10,653
right in front of my eyes.

1195
01:52:20,913 --> 01:52:22,853
I witnessed it all.

1196
01:52:30,060 --> 01:52:31,973
And today he doubts my integrity.

1197
01:52:33,554 --> 01:52:37,293
And if Nana doubts anyone's integrity,
then it's the end for that person.

1198
01:52:39,173 --> 01:52:40,573
You record your statement.

1199
01:52:43,173 --> 01:52:46,253
I will finish his
empire for good.

1200
01:52:59,453 --> 01:53:00,013
Mr. Thupe...

1201
01:53:02,373 --> 01:53:03,973
you did a great job today.

1202
01:53:04,612 --> 01:53:07,893
Sir, I supported these
criminals all my life.

1203
01:53:09,708 --> 01:53:14,093
Today I felt like safeguarding
our law, from these criminals.

1204
01:53:15,973 --> 01:53:18,573
Let us show Nana his real place.

1205
01:53:19,533 --> 01:53:20,813
And you don't worry
about this guy.

1206
01:54:07,561 --> 01:54:09,281
Sir, why have
you got me here?

1207
01:54:10,561 --> 01:54:12,961
You wanted to be a real
cop for a day, didn't you?

1208
01:54:13,121 --> 01:54:13,881
Yes!

1209
01:54:14,321 --> 01:54:15,401
So, it's your day today...

1210
01:54:16,826 --> 01:54:20,281
We are here to clear
this garbage all by ourselves.

1211
01:54:23,135 --> 01:54:24,361
Put on your cap.

1212
01:56:40,726 --> 01:56:41,801
Now he will know,

1213
01:56:42,441 --> 01:56:48,881
how an honest cop can shatter
a local goon's pride.

1214
01:57:17,325 --> 01:57:18,961
Stop this nonsense.

1215
01:57:35,601 --> 01:57:37,361
I have a warrant
to arrest you.

1216
01:57:37,561 --> 01:57:38,281
Is it?

1217
01:57:39,601 --> 01:57:40,361
You may go now,
come back tomorrow.

1218
01:57:40,521 --> 01:57:41,121
Is it so?

1219
01:57:41,905 --> 01:57:43,681
You have killed someone
to grab this piece of land.

1220
01:57:44,075 --> 01:57:46,281
We have gathered proof for it.

1221
01:57:47,281 --> 01:57:48,161
Also...

1222
01:57:48,935 --> 01:57:50,321
I have broken your
liquor shop to pieces.

1223
01:57:50,894 --> 01:57:54,881
We have seized your
illegal liquor dens.

1224
01:57:55,123 --> 01:57:59,241
Your illegal water-tanker
business is also shut from today.

1225
01:58:02,446 --> 01:58:05,241
I will follow the
rules and regulation.

1226
01:58:05,861 --> 01:58:07,801
You may try your influence.

1227
01:58:08,521 --> 01:58:11,121
If you try to safeguard him,

1228
01:58:11,681 --> 01:58:13,481
your names will appear
with this criminal too.

1229
01:58:13,816 --> 01:58:15,161
Keep that in mind and act.

1230
01:58:17,521 --> 01:58:19,561
You came here to
inaugurate this land...

1231
01:58:19,816 --> 01:58:22,401
and your own homeground
doesn't exist any more.

1232
01:58:22,826 --> 01:58:25,321
Come, it's 'Jail time'.

1233
01:58:26,106 --> 01:58:27,241
Go get my bail.

1234
01:58:28,521 --> 01:58:30,681
I will be out of the
prison in just 2 hours.

1235
01:58:31,161 --> 01:58:32,881
Let me explain...

1236
01:58:33,961 --> 01:58:35,281
I will arrest you now.

1237
01:58:36,037 --> 01:58:38,161
Your men will
go to the local court.

1238
01:58:38,481 --> 01:58:39,681
They will take an hour and half.

1239
01:58:40,066 --> 01:58:41,281
The court will be shut by then.

1240
01:58:41,900 --> 01:58:43,601
It's the weekend from tomorrow.

1241
01:58:43,801 --> 01:58:45,041
You will spend the next
two days inside the prison.

1242
01:58:45,462 --> 01:58:46,841
And in these two days,

1243
01:58:47,401 --> 01:58:50,521
I will destroy the rest
of your businesses.

1244
01:58:51,162 --> 01:58:52,761
It is impossible...

1245
01:58:53,404 --> 01:58:55,321
I will never
let it happen.

1246
01:58:55,533 --> 01:58:56,989
Hey... what are you guys looking at?

1247
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:06,561
I don't use it,

1248
01:59:07,153 --> 01:59:08,961
doesn't mean,
I don't know how to use it.

1249
01:59:09,651 --> 01:59:15,241
I will shoot his head off
if anyone even moves.

1250
01:59:18,281 --> 01:59:18,996
Come!

1251
01:59:36,947 --> 01:59:38,401
After all these years,

1252
01:59:38,481 --> 01:59:41,281
I will reinstate the village
deity back in the temple.

1253
01:59:41,361 --> 01:59:44,041
From now, our Lord
will rule this village.

1254
01:59:48,161 --> 01:59:51,441
"Lord Vitthal is earth,
water and the universe."

1255
01:59:51,521 --> 01:59:54,961
"Lord Vitthal is our support."

1256
01:59:55,234 --> 01:59:58,801
"Lord Vitthal is everything."

1257
01:59:58,881 --> 02:00:02,361
"True devotion is nothing
but you, Lord Vitthal."

1258
02:00:02,441 --> 02:00:05,961
"A devotee's tribute is
nothing but you lord Vitthal."

1259
02:00:06,041 --> 02:00:09,641
"Lord Vitthal's name
resonates in every chant."

1260
02:00:09,721 --> 02:00:13,321
"Vitthala! Vitthala!"

1261
02:00:13,401 --> 02:00:16,921
"Vitthala! Vitthala!"

1262
02:00:17,001 --> 02:00:20,521
"Vitthala! Vitthala!"

1263
02:00:20,601 --> 02:00:24,241
"Vitthala! Vitthala!"

1264
02:00:38,361 --> 02:00:39,521
"You are our father."

1265
02:00:39,601 --> 02:00:41,241
"You are our brother."

1266
02:00:41,408 --> 02:00:43,081
"You are a friend."

1267
02:00:43,161 --> 02:00:46,241
"You are our protector."

1268
02:00:46,761 --> 02:00:52,681
"Protect this child
of yours, always."

1269
02:00:52,961 --> 02:00:55,681
"In the time of darkness,

1270
02:00:55,961 --> 02:01:00,598
"you are always there to
show us the right path."

1271
02:01:01,321 --> 02:01:06,961
"At the time of trouble, you
come running to save us."

1272
02:01:07,401 --> 02:01:10,641
"You follow us like our shadow."

1273
02:01:11,041 --> 02:01:14,401
"Come running to us
when we need you."

1274
02:01:14,761 --> 02:01:20,281
"How can we imagine a life
without you oh Lord Mauli"

1275
02:01:21,961 --> 02:01:25,361
"Even when we went astray."

1276
02:01:25,641 --> 02:01:28,921
"You showed us the right path."

1277
02:01:29,321 --> 02:01:35,281
"How can we imagine a life
without you oh Lord Mauli"

1278
02:01:51,117 --> 02:01:58,284
"With hands on your hips,
you stood so gracefully on a brick"

1279
02:01:58,364 --> 02:02:05,481
"That's my Lord Vitthal's grace."

1280
02:02:05,561 --> 02:02:09,241
"He looks so beautiful and divine."

1281
02:02:09,321 --> 02:02:16,401
"We don't feel hungry or thirsty,
when we think of our Lord Vitthal"

1282
02:02:16,481 --> 02:02:20,161
"That's my Lord Vitthal's grace."

1283
02:02:20,241 --> 02:02:23,721
"There is no fear, no worry."

1284
02:02:23,801 --> 02:02:27,382
"Nothing can obstruct us now."

1285
02:02:27,462 --> 02:02:30,921
"We are all one and the same."

1286
02:02:31,121 --> 02:02:34,801
"We have understood that."

1287
02:02:34,881 --> 02:02:38,281
"You are within us
from head to toe."

1288
02:02:38,361 --> 02:02:41,561
"We have understood that."

1289
02:02:42,041 --> 02:02:49,241
"My body, my soul
is all yours oh Lord."

1290
02:02:52,836 --> 02:02:56,361
"Oh Lord, you are in
my mind all the time."

1291
02:02:56,557 --> 02:03:00,081
"We will always be your children."

1292
02:03:00,241 --> 02:03:07,161
"That's my Lord Vitthal's grace."

1293
02:03:26,641 --> 02:03:33,441
"Let greed and lust in
my mind end forever."

1294
02:03:33,881 --> 02:03:40,521
"My life should be into the
brick on which you stand oh Lord."

1295
02:03:41,241 --> 02:03:44,681
"I don't want to
shine like Gold."

1296
02:03:44,881 --> 02:03:47,881
"I will be happy to be the
steps of the temple that lead to you."

1297
02:03:48,441 --> 02:03:54,641
"Your sight will bring all
the happiness that we seek."

1298
02:03:54,841 --> 02:04:01,001
"The moment I trusted you,
all my worries disappeared."

1299
02:04:01,361 --> 02:04:08,281
"When I rest my head on your feet,"

1300
02:04:09,361 --> 02:04:16,321
"The lost hopes in me,
have lightened up."

1301
02:04:16,601 --> 02:04:23,683
"I know you will give
me the strength to go on."

1302
02:04:23,763 --> 02:04:30,861
"I don't exist anymore,
when I surrender myself to you."

1303
02:04:31,096 --> 02:04:38,121
"That's my Lord Vitthal's grace."

1304
02:04:38,362 --> 02:04:41,825
"When I give up the 'I' in me."

1305
02:04:42,030 --> 02:04:45,481
"I am a part of you and there
is nothing left in me.."

1306
02:04:45,700 --> 02:04:52,481
"That's my Lord Vitthal's grace."

1307
02:05:17,022 --> 02:05:19,022
I have been breaking the
law for over 15 years now.

1308
02:05:19,502 --> 02:05:21,382
You think it's difficult for
me to escape prison in two hours?

1309
02:05:22,982 --> 02:05:25,462
Just a single matchstick was enough
to destroy your only witness.

1310
02:05:26,164 --> 02:05:28,062
And you keep this in mind...

1311
02:05:28,702 --> 02:05:31,022
There is nothing to fear for
someone who has hit rock bottom.

1312
02:05:31,182 --> 02:05:33,142
You were fearless earlier,
now it's my turn.

1313
02:05:34,022 --> 02:05:37,622
I will destroy you first,
and then this temple of yours.

1314
02:05:39,662 --> 02:05:40,453
Mauli!

1315
02:05:53,063 --> 02:05:53,742
Brother!

1316
02:05:58,662 --> 02:05:59,982
Where are you?

1317
02:06:05,826 --> 02:06:06,625
Mauli!

1318
02:06:09,862 --> 02:06:11,102
Mauli!

1319
02:08:03,022 --> 02:08:06,622
When will you fools
stop fighting for a dead cause?

1320
02:08:08,123 --> 02:08:10,542
This is my place,
only I will rule here.

1321
02:08:11,740 --> 02:08:13,702
Forever!

1322
02:08:15,942 --> 02:08:17,222
It's been 15 years now...

1323
02:08:19,102 --> 02:08:21,102
People who spoke against me,

1324
02:08:21,182 --> 02:08:22,502
are all buried here...

1325
02:08:24,021 --> 02:08:25,302
Is there someone?

1326
02:08:26,782 --> 02:08:27,862
Someone...

1327
02:08:29,022 --> 02:08:31,862
who has the guts to light
up a lamp in this lamp-tower?

1328
02:08:33,222 --> 02:08:34,222
Not a single one!

1329
02:08:41,262 --> 02:08:42,462
Demolish this place.

1330
02:08:50,035 --> 02:08:50,982
Please stop...

1331
02:08:51,369 --> 02:08:52,342
No... sister,

1332
02:08:55,031 --> 02:08:56,662
if we get
scared of him today.

1333
02:08:56,822 --> 02:08:59,302
This darkness in our
lives will never be expelled.

1334
02:09:15,342 --> 02:09:16,062
Go!

1335
02:09:19,663 --> 02:09:20,399
Hey get up...

1336
02:09:20,479 --> 02:09:22,167
To hell with
this local goon.

1337
02:09:22,423 --> 02:09:24,887
Having a few dogs around
doesn't make him any powerful.

1338
02:09:24,967 --> 02:09:27,567
Mauli is the answer
to all our questions.

1339
02:09:27,647 --> 02:09:30,227
You may have different bodies,
but your vision will be the same.

1340
02:09:30,307 --> 02:09:32,127
They can break your bones...

1341
02:09:32,207 --> 02:09:33,947
But not your will...

1342
02:09:34,027 --> 02:09:35,767
Brother... will you be with me?

1343
02:09:36,507 --> 02:09:37,917
If you believe?

1344
02:09:38,117 --> 02:09:38,927
I will be there for you always

1345
02:09:39,007 --> 02:09:42,357
Look into their
eyes and tell them...

1346
02:09:42,547 --> 02:09:43,627
When you stand in
front of 'Mauli'...

1347
02:09:43,707 --> 02:09:44,427
bow your head down in respect,

1348
02:09:44,507 --> 02:09:46,723
and shove your tails
between your legs.

1349
02:10:18,255 --> 02:10:19,116
When you stand in
front of 'Mauli'...

1350
02:10:19,196 --> 02:10:20,254
bow your head down in respect,

1351
02:10:20,978 --> 02:10:22,366
and shove your tails
between your legs.

1352
02:10:23,735 --> 02:10:26,742
I will finish the terror you
have spread before finishing you.

1353
02:10:27,782 --> 02:10:29,942
You may try as hard as you can...

1354
02:10:30,702 --> 02:10:33,068
But today my courage
will remain unbroken.

1355
02:10:38,907 --> 02:10:45,587
"I found Lord Vitthal
in the Pandharpur, within me,"

1356
02:10:45,827 --> 02:10:52,467
"He tells me, why are you searching me
everywhere, when I reside in you."

1357
02:10:52,627 --> 02:10:59,347
"Am telling the world that it is my
privilege to have witnessed your presence."

1358
02:10:59,427 --> 02:11:06,267
"The intensity of your devotion is
irresistible as your door is opened now."

1359
02:11:13,212 --> 02:11:16,439
"There is no fear, no worry."

1360
02:11:16,519 --> 02:11:19,759
"Nothing can obstruct us now."

1361
02:11:19,839 --> 02:11:23,359
"We are all one and the same."

1362
02:11:23,439 --> 02:11:26,715
"We have understood that."

1363
02:11:33,604 --> 02:11:40,239
"I don't exist anymore,"
"when I surrender myself to you."

1364
02:11:40,559 --> 02:11:47,039
"That's my Lord Vitthal's grace."

1365
02:11:47,399 --> 02:11:50,759
"When I give up the 'I' in me."

1366
02:11:50,839 --> 02:11:54,199
"I am a part of you and there
is nothing left in me.."

1367
02:11:54,279 --> 02:12:01,039
"That's my Lord Vitthal's grace."

1368
02:12:42,123 --> 02:12:43,142
Hey, brother...

1369
02:12:52,821 --> 02:12:53,525
Brother...

1370
02:12:56,949 --> 02:12:59,116
So, finally you found me...

1371
02:12:59,797 --> 02:13:01,510
Where were you?

1372
02:13:02,535 --> 02:13:04,010
I was in you...

1373
02:13:05,486 --> 02:13:07,073
You were looking
for me all around...

1374
02:13:07,686 --> 02:13:09,323
But I was within
you all along.

1375
02:13:10,972 --> 02:13:13,222
Simply superb... brother.

1376
02:13:19,711 --> 02:13:20,391
Come with me.
