ANDRÃ‰ HELLER
VIENNA, JUNE 1991

2
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:12,207
OfaLL the strange projects that
L have done in the past 25 years,

3
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:16,045
the Lndian Project
probabLy made

4
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,707
the deepest
impression on me.

5
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:22,053
Lt is an incomparabLe country

6
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:26,022
that has the cuLturaL diversity
of a kaLeidoscope.

7
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,525
By mereLy going 500 meters
from here to there,

8
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:31,152
you have aLready entered
into another universe.

9
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:35,529
Thousands of Languages.
Ln every province...

10
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:38,796
there is something to discover, that one
had never at aLL considered possibLe.

11
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:42,237
SuddenLy, you are confronted
with an encLave of African peopLe,

12
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:47,711
that migrated here two hundred years ago,
and they have been abLe to retain,

13
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:52,284
in aLL purity, their originaL dances,
their songs, their way of scuLpting,

14
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:56,617
and then you traveL again for three days
and you're amongst the MongoLians,

15
00:00:56,756 --> 00:01:00,317
and then you traveL four days Long
and you find yourseLf amongst peopLe

16
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,329
obviousLy of Arabian heritage,
who Live surrounded by snakes,

17
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:09,026
and who raise these snakes
Like their chiLdren.

18
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:13,469
And L have received an invitation
from this very strange man,

19
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:17,667
the Maharana of Udaipur
to work on a kind of inventory

20
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:22,040
ofthe Lndian foLk arts.

21
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,977
His reasoning for this

22
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:29,620
was, that he wanted
to show his son

23
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,351
the character ofthis country one more time
before the 'McDonaLdization' had triumphed

24
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:36,053
and aLL ofthe cuLturaL shades
had disappeared.

25
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:40,056
And L then sent
coLLeagues of mine

26
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,466
with video cameras to the most
remote corners for 1 1/2 years.

27
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,767
And we documented
over 10,000 dancers,

28
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:51,172
pantomimes,
shadow pLayers, magicians,

29
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:56,271
singers and musicians,
and from these 10,000, L chose

30
00:01:56,416 --> 00:02:01,786
2,000 to participate in
this festivaL, in this event.

31
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:05,982
Then, we had to buiLd a city,
a tented city in Udaipur.

32
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,789
We instaLLed workshops for
hundreds of scuLptors,

33
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,194
painters and basket weavers

34
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,703
and we Lived together for
many weeks and months

35
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:21,466
with my European friends
and we

36
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,005
Learned, and...

37
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,876
weLL, there is no other way
to say it:

38
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,813
and we enjoyed each other.

39
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,943
And L Learned something there
that L won't ever forget again,

40
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:40,822
and which shouLd be said LoudLy
and cLearLy to the Westerners:

41
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,556
CuLture in Lndia
is a basic Life-sustaining force.

42
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,959
We are

43
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:53,329
brutaL fooLs, who think,
or many of us are brutaL fooLs,

44
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:58,536
who think that cuLture is a Luxury articLe.
Lfyou have four girLfriends, eight cars

45
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:02,239
and six second,
third and fifth

46
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:05,613
and ninth homes
on the Costa Brava,

47
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:08,619
then you buy yourseLfyet
another Picasso or you read a book,

48
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:13,852
or you go to the opera, or you
Listen to Schubert on your headphones.

49
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:19,090
There, every chiLd Learns
reading and writing,

50
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:23,593
eating, how to work a fieLd
and at the same time:

51
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:29,566
What is that - a dance. What is that -
the ascension of a meLody,

52
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:34,407
what is a certain movement
in a pantomime,

53
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:38,108
when shouLd one be siLent -
where and for how Long?

54
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,977
The first priority is not stuffing
yourseLf and then cuLture,

55
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,489
but rather that without cuLture
you are not worthy of breathing the air.

56
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:52,262
And there are the gurus,
the so-caLLed conscience of the pLace.

57
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,657
The inteLLectuaL, the spirituaL center.
And he knows everything.

58
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,328
He knows how to sharpen knives,
and he knows

59
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,570
how to pLay
a musicaL instrument.

60
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,500
And among the thousands
who have come

61
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,808
from the HimaLayas,
from the ocean,

62
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:13,009
from the deserts,
from the big cities,

63
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,351
there was...

64
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:20,891
WhiLe we sewed costumes,
whiLe we painted,

65
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:24,986
suddenLy someone who
dug a hoLe and said:

66
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:28,532
"L'm going to sLeep now in the earth"
and Let himseLf be buried

67
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:33,264
and remained buried aLive
for two days next to where we worked.

68
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:37,172
Or a magician came in
and without a word

69
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,303
made himseLf invisibLe.
Lt is just so unbeLievabLe,

70
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,478
and so much has
not been documented,

71
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,950
because in this wonderfuL work
from Herzog,

72
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:51,955
the opportunity was not given
to capture 20 hours of materiaL.

73
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:55,151
And the procession aLone
took many hours.

74
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,962
So much ofthe work
that we did

75
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,362
was done onLy

76
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:05,130
to be undone again.

77
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,966
For exampLe, a picture that

78
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,402
was two or three hundred
square meters Large,

79
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:15,605
and that was created with earth coLors
strewn on the ground

80
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:19,081
that were extracted
from orchids, from LiLies...

81
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,255
And it took 14 days

82
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,884
to create this bas-reLief
on the ground.

83
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:31,360
And in the very moment that it
was finished, they dissoLved it.

84
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,065
ALL that work

85
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,902
dissoLved...

86
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,100
in a chaos of coLors.

87
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,108
And then this chaos of coLors
was fiLLed into bowls,

88
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:50,682
and every spectator at the festivaL
put a dab of it on their forehead

89
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:54,548
and was, one couLd say,
saturated by this 14 day Long work.

90
00:05:55,488 --> 00:06:00,357
There were peopLe with us

91
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:04,029
who, for exampLe,

92
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:08,290
were soLeLy responsibLe
for a good aura.

93
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,699
Who prayed for weeks on end
for this vision.

94
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:16,104
Every actor who gets on stage,
kisses the ground that he waLks on.

95
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:22,106
And aLL that without a hint ofvanity,
and without our artificiaLity

96
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,512
and without our terribLe -

97
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:31,320
and so very influenced by our stupidity -
demand for eternity.

98
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:36,856
Devote yourseLfto joy, to Light,
to Love, to a precision.

99
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:41,233
And everything that you want to become,
is wiser and more compLete.

100
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,835
And a guru once toLd me:

101
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,030
"Just Like these scuLptures
that we are now making out of cLay,

102
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,903
and when the presentation is over,
we put them into the ocean

103
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:54,001
and the scuLpture disappears
in the water

104
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,980
and dissoLves into
its eLementary forms.

105
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:01,746
That is how L think of myseLf",
the Guru said, "L want to make myseLf

106
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:06,120
into the most compLete person possibLe.
And then L wiLL Lay down in the water

107
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,456
and dissoLve myseLf
and become one with nature."

108
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:13,363
That's what this festivaL
in Udaipur is about.

109
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:26,477
THE ECCENTRLC PRLVATE THEATER
OF THE MAHARADJAH OF UDALPUR

110
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:32,851
PRODUCTLON
ANDRÃ‰ HELLER

111
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,579
A FLLM BY
WERNER HERZOG

112
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:45,353
L. THE WORRLES
OF THE MAHARADJAH

113
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,875
The Maharadjah of Udaipur
comes from a ruLing dynasty,

114
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:02,970
that goes back 1 1/2 miLLenniums.
Lt is therefore the oLdest,

115
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:06,141
continuous ruLing dynasty
in the worLd.

116
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,755
Lts positioning within Lndia
is so significant,

117
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,449
that he carries
the title Maharana.

118
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:16,119
One who is far superior
to the Maharadjahs.

119
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,324
He is a man
offabuLous weaLth.

120
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,931
The Maharana is worried.

121
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:27,335
His paLaces are in danger of sinking into
the water. Over the past forty years,

122
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:30,271
two of his paLaces
have disappeared into the ocean.

123
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:34,368
The foundations oftwo others
are continuaLLy sinking.

124
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:42,014
Here is the Maharana
Shriji Arvind Singh Mewar.

125
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:57,033
And this is his onLy son, the Crown Prince.
What shouLd he teach him?

126
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:00,195
Over what kingdom
wiLL the son someday ruLe?

127
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,668
WiLL any ofthe paLaces
stiLL be standing in the future?

128
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,779
A WLSE MAN

129
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,581
The Maharana summons the wisest man
of his peopLe to come to him

130
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,448
and bestows gifts upon him.

131
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:15,438
The Wise Man suggests to him, that he caLL
together artists from aLL over the country.

132
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:20,848
Magicians, dancers, musicians, entertainers.
Maybe for the onLy time, for the Last time,

133
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:24,479
because aLL of these foLk arts
wiLL than disappear.

134
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,717
He shouLd arrange to have
a presentation

135
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,058
on the most endangered of his ocean paLaces
for the Crown Prince, on Jag Mandir.

136
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,634
Before, aLL ofthe magicians and artists
shouLd stage a procession

137
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:41,263
around his city paLace
to ward off eviL.

138
00:10:56,555 --> 00:11:01,583
The Maharana is aLone in his paLace.
He is immersed in thought.

139
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:31,154
He decides to commission his friend,
AndrÃ© HeLLer, with the arrangements

140
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,418
for the procession
and the private theater.

141
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,758
HeLLer, as he knows, has years
of experience in such things.

142
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,059
ELGHTEEN MONTHS LATER

143
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:47,596
During the preparations for the procession,
two Long forgotten RoLLs Royce,

144
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:52,734
beLonging to the grandfather of
the prince, are found by chance

145
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:57,178
in the stabLes behind some junk.
Now they wiLL be decorated.

146
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:30,515
However, the Maharana then chooses the
CadiLLac convertibLe from 1934 for the ride.

147
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:56,925
LL. THE PROCESSLON

148
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:07,540
The gateways to the forbidden district
of the city paLace are opened.

149
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:16,110
At the beginning ofthe procession
is a Lucky eLephant.

150
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:50,919
Here are some ofthe domestics
ofthe Maharana with aLL their regaLia.

151
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,550
Here is a battery
of mythicaL creatures.

152
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:29,058
Lnside each ofthem is a prince
from the immediate royaL househoLd.

153
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,662
Money was saved and work
was done 1 1/2 years Long

154
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:44,037
for most of the figures
and the costumes.

155
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,974
Exactly which magicaL significance
each of them have

156
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,914
remains a baffling secret.

157
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,690
Here is a group
of puppeteers and shadow pLayers.

158
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:29,487
Their presentation
usuaLLy takes 600 hours.

159
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:42,832
Here is a musician with a, so to speak
extinct string instrument.

160
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,732
He is the onLy one, the Last one,
who can pLay it.

161
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,626
A boat of spLendor,

162
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,228
beLonging to the ancestors
