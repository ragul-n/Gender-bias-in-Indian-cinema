00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,174
Wait wait
What's all this?

3
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,003
-Sir, about our market
-Somehow you have to

4
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:48,347
l've told you many times not
to drag me into your land dispute

5
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,346
l can do nothing
-lf you say so

00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,508
Why not?
What is special about me?

As if that's not enough,

you will have to garland
my dead body instead of me

00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,025
Please don't drag me into it

12
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,858
There are courts and lawyers
Go, try with them

13
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,030
No lawyer is ready
to accept our case

14
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,693
Obviously they won't. How can they?
Legally that land belongs to you

15
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,871
Do you have legal documents?
No. Nayudamma has them

16
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:21,305
Actually -Legal or illegal,
you can do nothing about him

17
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:27,543
l don't want this garland Please
understand me Move aside

18
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,627
Who is Nayudamma?

You are new here

00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,128
We cannot depend on anyone
Let's meet the CM tomorrow

-That would be right -What lf
Nayudamma comes to know of it?

l advice you not to take any complaints

You are a police

00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,696
Look, l know why
everyone is going away

47
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,696
Whoever is scared

48
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,305
-Sir, they are cowards
-You tell me

49
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,770
Sit down
Are you Nayudamma?

50
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,636
Do you think you are a man?

51
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:41,746
-You -You
Go away, get lost

52
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,758
-Did you come here expecting
him to help? -No

53
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,690
Run, run away from here

54
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,446
What happened here?

55
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,685
We arrested and brought
him here in a robbery case

56
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,286
He tried to shoot
our Cl and escape

57
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:30,159
l had no option but
to shoot him down

58
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,427
Good! Change the FlR

59
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,967
How dare you come to the
police station and shoot a policeman!

60
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,174
-Where did you get
the courage from? -From you

61
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:56,247
Please Nayudamma, you can
tell me if you've any problem

62
00:05:56,522 --> 00:06:02,654
Narayana, l, Nayudamma doesn't
need police help

63
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:07,765
You know me well. Anybody interferes in
Mahankali market, meets this fellow's fate

64
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,806
Our Nayudamma is messiah of
the poor, leader of the leaders

65
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:35,970
My fellow brothers and l, Dasanna wish our
Nayudamma's Dubai visit to be successful

00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,812
-He is a leader! My foot!

People here are
becoming daring l guess

68
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,839
Are you daring to complain against
Nayudamma? Are you trying to act funny?

69
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,845
You have seen the fate of Kondalrao

70
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,046
Beware, you rogues

71
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,757
From today onwards, each shop
in this market pays Rs.200 per day. . .

00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,918
. . .each hut pays Rs50, as penalty
lt is Nayudamma's order. Get lost

73
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:28,356
Hurry up Put in the money
Come on

74
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:36,035
-A man dies only once -Drop the money
-l don't have any -Don't you have?

75
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,901
A coward dies each day

76
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:48,042
Even God won't come to the
rescue of such cowards

77
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,552
Come on, drop the cash

78
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,659
Only a courageous man can bring
salvation for you people

79
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,302
Here comes such a man!

But we are -May be but not the
house Where are you going?

We are the new
tenants of this house

135
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,981
You could have told me so
How is Rajeswari related to you?

136
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,480
He is her son -What is
your relation with him?

137
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,810
Whatever you assume
Then l'll assume he is a se<i>rv</i>ant

138
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,822
Don't be shocked
What about that food container?

139

We have just arrived and couldn't cook
Brought food from outside

142
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,601
You may hang any number of calendars
on the walls -But we cannot use nails

143
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,835
-Like l said, water is

144
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,011
Do you think we bathe all
the time and through out the year?

145
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,338
-What else? -We bathe only
on the occasion of festivals

146

What is important?
Education or co-ed?

00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,706
Entertainment is necessary
along side education, uncle

155

-That is true

156
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,983

boxes because of that

157
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,451
Sister-in-law, you better
keep him under control

158
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,220
-What is the matter, Balu?
-Ask him. He will tell you

159
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,216
Were you naughty with uncle?

160
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:00,565
-When does the college begin?
-From Monday, brother -l see

161
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,131
-Where is mother?
-Over there

162
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:10,574
Should you have to start this
work as soon as you come?

163
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,337
lt is nothing new

164
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,840
Lakshmi's medical college
starts from day after tomorrow

165
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,711
Cherry got admission in
a good school. l got a shop

166
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:24,354
Gas connection is promised in 2 days
ls there any other work to be done?

167
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:30,926
These things are okay
My fear is of this town

168
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,266
Fear lies in our minds and nothing
to do with the place we live

169
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:40,397
Any place will do if we are brave
Have trust in me. Let's go and eat

170
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,604
-Lakshmi
-Yes Brother

171
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,140
-What color chudidhar do you want?
-l leave it to you

172
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:39,759
-What are you doing?
-l didn't know it's your veil

173
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:43,656
-Why am l wearing it then?
-Even l was wondering

174
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,304
l see!

175
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:50,000
You came to the shop with an
intention to find a beautiful girl

176
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,974
Pulled my 'dupatta' when
you found me lsn't it?

177
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:58,181
Oh God! l didn't do it
on purpose l swear on you

178
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:03,354
Accept you made a mistake

179
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:04,848
Why do l confess to
a mistake l didn't do?

180
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:08,515
Men like you are not new to me
You better accept l'll let you go

181
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,362
Else, l'll send you behind
bars for eve teasing

182
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:15,021
-l had no intention of.. -You are
at fault and dare raise voice too?

183
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,027
l said it wasn't intentional
Don't

184
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:21,365
Madam, let it go
He said it isn't intentional

185
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,867
No, l know such men very well
They shouldn't be pardoned

186
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:31,047
Few more like him
here would ruin business

187
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,414
He doesn't appear to be such a person

188
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:42,886
Their appearance can be deceptive

189
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,064
At the sight of a girl

190
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:08,409
Wait there
What have you done?

191
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,418
l opened the door by mistake

192
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:12,920
By mistake!

193
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:17,061
Why do you laugh?
Who are you to question me anyway?

194
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:21,994
l'm a man and came to give
moral support to another man

195
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,461
-Aren't you a man?
-Absolutely

196
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,273
You made a big issue
of my unintentional act

197
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:30,873
You caught a 50 year old. . .

198
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:36,537
. . .half naked! ls it fair?

199
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,114
She caught me naked

200
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:42,286
What is the relation between
your fight and my wearing clothes?

201
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:43,283
There is a relation

202
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,885
An accident vehicle isn't
moved until a case is filed

203
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,582
Only then insurance in sanctioned
This is similar to that

204
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:00,804
Let me tell you now that

205
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:04,806
You came to the shop with
intention to find a fat uncle. . .

206
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,343
. . .one in a checkered underpants
Opened the trial room door

207
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,912
-Who? Me? -You -l tried to
find him! -Of course yes

208
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,044
ls he so famous here
that l look at him?

209
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:19,052
So, you want to see a filmy hero!

210
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,589
She is trying to save
her face when caught

211
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,498
You did it on purpose, right?
-of course not

212
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,332
Accept it as your mistake

213
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:36,504
Else l'll send you behind
bars for Adam teasing

214
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:42,011
-What! -You are at fault
and dare raise your voice!

215
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:46,378
Leave it -No, sir
-She said it is unintentional

216
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:49,179
No, sir l know these types
They shouldn't be pardoned

217
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:51,855
Few more like them in the
shop will ruin the business

218
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:59,523
She doesn't appear
to be such a girl

219
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,398
Their looks can be deceptive

220
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:08,873
How can you barge
into a men's trial room?

221
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:13,040
-l concede it's a mistake
-You mean, do you accept it is intentional?

222
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:20,545
Okay, both of us didn't
do anything intentionally

223
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,557
You may leave now

224
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:33,386
Brother you saved my honour
You are a true man

225
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:34,963
Enough of exposure
Put on the pant

226
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:41,906
Speak in English only

227
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:54,911
l've heard of a communist, terrorist,
chemist but not heard of bouquet-ist

228
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,415
l think he is weak in English
l think you are weak in English

229
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:02,255
lt means, a person
who arranges flowers

230
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:05,858
He is called a florist
not bouquet -ist

231
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,262
You said it is bouquet-ist

232
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,094
-Cherry told me so
-Never take his help again

233
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:17,437
-Come to the point
-Our flowers are world famous

234
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:20,668

We will change the look of your
entire hotel, you will be promoted

00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:33,953
We will give you
25% commission too

241
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,958
That is the only word l don't
like in English dictionary

242
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:40,361
Give it to me as gift

243
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,932
That's enough
-See you again tomorrow morning

244
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:52,640

Sankranti, and of my size too

247
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:00,715
Okay, you may leave

248
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:07,484
-Why the collection is less? -Every
shop kept your mother's photograph

249
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,236
Then how did you get
that 20 rupees?

250
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:23,498
That mutton shop guy
didn't get our mother's photograph

251
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:27,508
-He gave that -l see, then he will
also keep the photograph tomorrow. . .

252
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:29,839
. . .and we won't get
that 20 rupees too -Yes

253
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,675
Balu is responsible for all this

254
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:36,851
He started with mother's photo
Everyone followed suit

255
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:42,891
Do they think they can
hoodwink us using mother's photo?

256
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:46,188
Not everyone but only Balu

257
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:50,056
He collected money from us
within 10 minutes of his arrival

258
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:54,361
He is not a simpleton
but very dangerous

259
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:57,799
-Yes, you are right
-Brother

260
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,915
-What is that?
-Photograph and money

261
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:12,147
Everyone has made it
commercial. l don't want it

262
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:16,225
Mother is in my heart
That is today's collection

mother's photo other than Balu

00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,732
Why are you behaving indecently?

268
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:12,104
-A for apple? -Yes
-Why did you react like that for this?

269
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,148
lt's not my mistake if
your assumption is wrong

270
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,377
-Wrong! Do you know
what is 'wrong'? -l know

271
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,785
What's it? l won't tell you
-Why? -Because l'm a kid

Whistling isn't bad
My uncle taught me

This guy is worse than his uncle

370
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,899
l'd have hanged myself
if a girl says so to me

371
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:45,408
She said many more things

372
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:48,247
Come here

373
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:52,585
Why did you scold him?

00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,591
You can complaint to teacher,
or tell me

376

Who are you to scold him?
Has he taught her to drink, smoke?

377
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:08,594
-Only to whistle -Only to whistle
For that you gouge out his eyes!

402
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:12,054
You rascal, rogue, pimp

-Good evening, sir
-Stop there

404
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,503
You give me your phone number

405
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,236
But given her your phone
and made her abuse me

406
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:33,075
l haven't ever been abused
by anyone so much

407
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,981
-You are..
-Get lost before l murder you

408
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:40,750
-Sir, -Don't call me sir
-My phone is with me

409
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:45,428
What happened now?

410
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:01,440
Swetha, l'm Parthasarathi

411
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,608
l've discussed about your visa

412
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,777
l made him agree with
great difficulty

413
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:10,719
Get lost
No one wants your visa

414
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:12,516
Have you gone out of your way
because a girl requested you?

415
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,782
Who is this?
lsn't Swetha there?

416
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:18,719
She may be here or has gone out
Why do you bother?

417
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:22,955
Many students are standing
in queue for hours for visa

418
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:26,625
Have you ever bothered about them?
Why so much interest about a girl?

419
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,466
Have you forgotten
about your age? Bad

420
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:35,210
Behave yourself
Give respect -Respect!

421
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:41,146
You monkey, donkey, pig. . .

422
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,992
You told me you will
call me about my visa

423
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:57,498
l'll see that you will
never ever enter America

424
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,439
-You
-What did the old man say?

425
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:14,516
Did he refuse to give visa? This is
the result of messing with me

426
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:24,187
You better return
my phone to me

427
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,525
Bye, till then

428
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:43,542

How could you
Okay, where is my phone?

430
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,721

-Where?

431
00:44:57,928 --> 00:45:00,226
What are you
staring at? lt is your phone

432
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,897
You must have broken mine too

433
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:05,565
Never mind l can buy
100 such phones

434
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:13,402
Destroying is easy
Creating is difficult

435
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:16,404
Those cannot create
have no right to destroy

436
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:19,741
You better know it
Here is your phone

437
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:55,618
Are you thinking about me and. . .

438
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:57,613

cell phone as mouse?

439

Mother went to temple in the
evening not returned yet

l told her not to go anywhere
Why did she go to temple?

Hail Mr.Rangarao

469
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:16,706
Hail Mr.Rangarao

470
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:19,381
What brings all of you here?

471
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,048
We have worked for
generations in your fields

472
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:25,384
Hence, your ancestors have donated
the land at Mahankali to us

473
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:27,890
Shops we had set up there are
our source of livelihood

474
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:30,059
lt is a known fact
Why do you mention it now?

475
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,056
We don't have legal documents

476
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:33,389
Nayudamma found it
out somehow and. . .

477
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,732
. . .grabbed it
Now harassing us

478
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:39,899
That is unfair. Do not police
and law exist in these times?

479
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,738
No use even if they exist
He is very influential

480
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:45,241
You are the owner of that land

481
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:48,570
Only your involvement
can bring justice to us

482
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:52,912
Don't worry. Original documents
of the land are with me

483
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:55,411
l'll register them in your names

484
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:57,579
Bless you, sir

485
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:06,418
l hear Nayudamma is a mean fellow
Don't disturb him

486
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:09,425
He has disturbed us. Who
do you think those people are?

487
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:11,760
They are se<i>rv</i>ing us for us
for generations

488
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:13,265
We have to care for them

489
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:14,934
Don't live on old sentiments

490
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:16,765
Our only source of
livelihood is my job

491
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:18,941
We are left with only this house

492
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:20,435
You are responsible for this

493
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:24,777
Shut up. You talk so because
we are living on your income

494
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:29,115
No, mother. lt's because l didn't
want him to confront Nayudamma

495
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,118
We have no one to lean on
if we get into trouble

496
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:36,888
Could be. But your father's
word is a word

497
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:44,461
He is ignorant
You may do as you please

498
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,972
Mr.Lawyer, register
them carefully

499
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:52,968
They are poor l want no
injustice meted out to them

500
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:54,473
-Don't worry, l'll handle it
-Hello, lawyer

501
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:05,151
l used to feel funny for
not having documents

502
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:09,317
But you kept the documents
and made me a fool

503
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:13,659
l get serious whenever
someone seeks legal help

504
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:18,164
Transfer the documents in my name,
accept the money l give and leave

505
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:19,665
Don't interfere in this
matter unnecessarily

506
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:23,836
l'll register them in the name
of those who lived here for years

507
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:31,011
Let's do one thing. l'll pay
you nothing. Sign the documents

508
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:33,842
Are you threatening me?

509
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:38,343
No matter what you do,
you won't get Mahankali market

510
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:39,851
Let us do something else

511
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:45,851
Give away, in writing, the market
and your house to me

512
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:49,357
Shut up. Don't consider
yourself great

513
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:53,536
Your wish will never be fulfilled
as long as l'm alive

514
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:10,052
Do you know why he is
screaming? Because of pain

515
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:13,723
You will suffer
more if he dies

516
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:15,888
-Can you bear it?
-No

517
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:39,581
You have signed them easily

518
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:42,581
l don't want you go
to court to fight a case

519
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:53,095
Mrs.Gayatridevi, l'm
lawyer Vishwanath speaking

520
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:55,260
Nayudamma killed
your husband and your son

521
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:58,263
He is coming for you. Get out
of town with the children

522
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:12,779
Mother, it's me

523
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:17,949
Did she get it earlier?

524
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:23,118
-No! -l suspect blood clots
Let's do an angiography tomorrow

525
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:24,790
Okay, Sir

526
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:33,302
-What brings you here?
-Lilly's birthday is on 21st

527
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:35,130
-You must come
-Positively

528
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:38,299
What's the problem with
the man just left you?

529
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:41,143
lt's his mother not him
She had a mild heart attack

530
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:50,645
Balu, you are trapped

531
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:55,150
-You are exposed. Dasanna
wants you come -Come on

532
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:08,501
-All of you get out
-You too go out

533
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:15,177
Don't you have anyone?

534
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:17,505
-No, brother
-Mother?

535
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:25,680
Have you forgotten that today
is mother's death anniversary

536
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,688
l knew l even offered worship
is her name in the temple

537
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:34,693
Here is kumkum

538
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:43,035
Don't take liquor today
for the sake of mother's soul

539
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:46,868
Don't say so -Why?
-Mother loved liquor

540
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:51,202
She loved the liquor den
more than the home

541
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:53,549
She used to stay there
most of the time

542
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:56,378
One Mr.Kiranseth from
Delhi came to meet you

543
00:55:58,588 --> 00:55:59,384
Kiranseth! l'm going

544
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:02,217
-Wait, brother
-Greetings, sir

545
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:09,227
You look familiar

546
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:11,900
He is my younger brother
Tell me why are you here

547
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:16,898
l heard Mahankali
market is for sale

548
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:21,908
l heard Nayudamma
depends a lot on you

549
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:27,576
You have to deal for me

550
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:31,910
l'll speak to him when he returns
from Dubai. You may leave

551
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:33,414
Okay, l take your leave

552
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:44,096
Where have l seen this
man before? Where?

553
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:49,931
Do you remember now?
You better forget

554
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:54,439
Don't talk about me
Hope you know me well

555
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:59,445
Don't dare be seen in
this area again Go

556
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:06,117
Let's get out
Speed up

557
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:51,329
How is mother feeling? -Aunty
-Let it be sister-in-law

558
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:57,169
l couldn't restrain
myself from going there

559
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:04,176
l can understand mother
But we must wait for a while

560
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:11,850
-Sister-in-law, what are these?
-Cherry's friend Lilie's..

561
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:13,852
aunty's father is chief
of this hospital

562
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:17,018
He visited her thrice
Treating her like a VlP

563
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:24,192
l was talking about this
girl, Swetha

564
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:29,868
-How is aunty?
-Fine

565
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:36,872
l was wondering where l
saw her l remembered Cherry

566
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:39,215
He resembles his mother a lot

567
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:43,052
l enquired and
found out, it's a fact

568
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:47,382
Don't worry aunty
We will take care of you

569
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:50,055
Thank you very much?
What are you doing?

570
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:51,719
l studied Visual Communication

571
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:54,396
Wanted to go to US
for further studies

572
00:58:55,265 --> 00:59:01,568
But..didn't want to leave
dear ones and go that far

573
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:06,067
-Mother, l'll see the doctor
-l'll leave Bye

574
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:13,408
-What for?
-For breaking your phone

575
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:17,913
l felt bad later
You can ask our Lilly

576
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:23,920
-l know nothing
-She doesn't know

577
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:26,262
l stopped breaking anything
since that day

578
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:31,927
l stopped eating even
omelette. You can ask why

579
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:34,929
-Why?
-Because l've to break eggs

580
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:05,968

Balu, you will be shocked
to hear this

598
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:10,041
Then don't tell me

599
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:16,716
Yet l'll tell you
Swetha loves me

600
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:23,892
You got tongue tied!
Further news will make you faint

601
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:26,891
She gave me 25,000/- advance

602
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:27,892
To love her!

603
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:29,394
Don't be sarcastic
No one pays to be loved

604
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:32,063
lt is to supply
flowers to her hotel

605
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:37,064
-Return that money
-Are you jealous?

606
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:39,734
l said return it

607
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:45,574
Why? What's wrong in it?
Cannot l give a contract?

608
01:04:46,115 --> 01:04:47,582
-Excellent
-Will you shut up?

609
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:52,417
Tell me why should the
advance be returned?

610
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:53,919
You are going too far

611
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:57,919
Do you mean l did this
to impress you?

612
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:03,088
l just wanted to help. Do you think
you are the most handsome guy here?

613
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:07,265
l don't need to do it

614
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:12,100
Snap of my fingers can make
hundred men stand in queue for me

615
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:28,453
What's wrong with you?

616
01:05:29,992 --> 01:05:31,789
Your overacting
spoiled my name

617
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:35,122
-She came for me -Yes
l actually came for you

618
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:41,125
You are the most handsome
guy in the town. Okay?

619
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:55,977
l've shamelessly expressed
my love. Won't you respond to it?

620
01:05:58,688 --> 01:05:59,655
What do l lack?

621
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:02,658
You know nothing about me

622
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:06,995
l'm just fooling with you

623
01:06:09,865 --> 01:06:10,832
l don't love you

624
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:18,170
l'm sorry if l've given you
wrong impression unknowingly

625
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:29,347
Poor girl

626
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:33,354
Why show pity? Have you
forgotten why we are here?

627
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:43,358
Balu, are you getting pain again?
You shouldn't

628
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:44,362
We better go to hospital

629
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:46,368
Hospital isn't a priority now

630
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:49,037
How can you say so
when you are in pain?

631
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:53,538
Time has come for us to
complete what we came here for

632
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:56,374
Nayudamma is coming tomorrow

633
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:07,445
-Come out
-Wait

634
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:15,286
Leave me

635
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:18,626
Listen to me. Wait.

636
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:22,628
Who the hell are you? How dare
you come to kill Nayudamma?

637
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:44,986
Do you understand at least
now what happened?

638
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:48,316
l heard someone planted a bomb in
your car l came to save you

639
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:52,153
-See what happened
-Don't lie

640
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:58,163
-Why should l lie? -Police can
only suspect others not save

641
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:00,331
What is your name?

642
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:03,668
Balu, he is our boy
Very sharp

643
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:08,002
l can see that
lt must be Ramana's job

644
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:23,187
Come here, not you

645
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:28,025
Balu, you come here

646
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:36,534
You've given me a new lease of life
Have a drink for my satisfaction

647
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:40,039
-No, thanks
-Have it -No, thanks

648
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:42,707
Take it

649
01:09:58,594 --> 01:10:00,892
What happened to your Dubai work?

650
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:06,724
l sold the Mahankali market. . .

651
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:09,901
. . .for 200 crores

652
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:12,900
Do you know who bought it?

653
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:23,680
He is in Tihar jail, isn't it?
Got out on bail and went to Dubai

654
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:26,151
-How did he get the passport?
-That's the specialty of Khan

655
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:28,084
He has a small kingdom set up there

656
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:31,256
We are kids compared to him

657
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:33,088
Why does he need
Mahankali market then?

658
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:36,023
Khan's native place is
Hyderabad

659
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:41,592
He plans to raze down the market
and build a huge factory there

660
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:47,432
Beware Nayudamma Friendship
with such people isn't advisable

661
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:52,275
Stop giving me advice and. . .

662
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:54,783
. . .find out who planted the
bomb in the car

663
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:12,195
-Brother Brother
-What's the matter?

664
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:14,803
Have you read today's paper?

665
01:11:23,178 --> 01:11:24,202
Someone named Rajeswari
advertised that. . .

666
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,311
. . .she will register the land
of Mahankali market. . .

667
01:11:26,515 --> 01:11:27,812
. . .in the name of dese<i>rv</i>ing people

668
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,812
ls Rajeswari back in town?

669
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:36,992
-Have you read the paper?
-l did What's all this?

670
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:38,318
Don't worry!

671
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,985
No one can do anything as long
as the documents are with you

672
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:46,497
l want to say something if
you don't mind -What's it?

673
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:50,998
You were out of town for a month

674
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:55,010
Many things happened
during that time

675
01:11:56,211 --> 01:12:00,170
Someone planted a bomb in
your car as soon as you came

676
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,518
Now someone gave advertisement
in the name of Rajeswari

677
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:09,350
This makes me suspect
the safetyof the documents

678
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:15,360
Khan has bought the market
DCP said he is a dangerous man

679
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:18,696
Check, once, if the documents
are safe

680
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:28,100
-See that no one gets in
-Okay, Brother

681
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:05,178
-Brother -Halt there
Why did you come in?

682
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:07,582
Phone call for you

683
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:15,590
No one is on the line

684
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:18,586
-But it rang
-Never mind go out

685
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:28,599
-Where is Balu
-Why?

686
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:31,773
Be cautious with him
He planted the bomb in your car

687
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:33,339
l just found out
in the investigation

688
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:43,118
Who are you?

689
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:56,691
-Rajeswari's son
-Why are you here?

690
01:13:56,832 --> 01:13:58,527
For the legal documents
which are in your possession

691
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:01,636
And for your signature on them

692
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:06,136
For the land of Mahankali market

693
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:09,637
For the sake of fulfilling
the promise Rangarao made to them

694
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:13,971
You are joking, you kid

695
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:17,051
l never thought
l'll see you again

696
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:21,726
My husband is no more
but his promise remains

697
01:18:22,764 --> 01:18:24,891
You'll be rid of your troubles today

698
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:27,064
His promise will be fulfilled

699
01:18:32,774 --> 01:18:35,242
-Why has Balu not come yet?
-l'll go and check

700
01:19:42,677 --> 01:19:43,644
Greetings, Khanbhai

701
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:47,982
Where is Ghani

702
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:51,152
Ghani! Who is Ghani?

703
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:55,156
l saw Ghani with him
He said he is like his brother

704
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:57,490
He is not Ghani but Balu

705
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:09,735
-Where is Balu?
-He just now cheated me. . .

706
01:20:09,871 --> 01:20:13,671
. . .and has left with the
documents of market we promised you

707
01:20:18,547 --> 01:20:19,844
Why does he need documents?

708
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:23,176
-He is Rajeswar's son
-Rajeswari's son!

709
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:34,927
He has fooled all of us

710
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:38,195
He doesn't have parents

711
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:49,370
l'm everything for him
including his death

712
01:20:50,078 --> 01:20:54,538
You dog, scoundrel, rascal

713
01:22:09,157 --> 01:22:10,784
Brother, l'm sure this
is Balu's vehicle

714
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:13,123

715
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:18,460

You are breaking things!

718
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:51,328
Your father
sold you to me for 500/-

719
01:22:51,533 --> 01:22:54,502
You are creating
a loss, you pig

720
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:58,999
You will never improve
You can marry, isn't it?

721
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:04,338
My father always said
no intelligent man marries

722
01:23:07,382 --> 01:23:08,178
Come here kid

723
01:23:10,885 --> 01:23:14,184

Look at the man sitting
with the lawyer, there

732
01:23:44,085 --> 01:23:46,053
He is Khan, from Hyderabad

733
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:55,461
That rogue Khan comes from
Hyderabad and messes with us

734
01:23:55,597 --> 01:23:59,055
-Shall l finish him?
-He is destined to die in my hands

735
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:10,578
Khan, look at the boy
giving sign signals

736
01:24:12,447 --> 01:24:13,243
What's he saying?

737
01:24:13,615 --> 01:24:18,075
Table No3, gun

738
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:29,429

01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:49,113
Aren't you scared by the firing?

742
01:24:49,384 --> 01:24:50,681
Fear is like death

743
01:24:51,986 --> 01:24:52,782
What!!

744
01:25:04,566 --> 01:25:06,295

money but couldn't

808
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:29,357
Condition here is not good

809
01:34:29,897 --> 01:34:31,865
Same with the business

810
01:34:32,233 --> 01:34:36,363
Hence, couldn't send money for
2 months Please, understand

811
01:34:36,737 --> 01:34:39,706
You should quit studies
and come home

812
01:34:40,241 --> 01:34:42,471
l know how much it hurts you

813
01:34:42,843 --> 01:34:46,210
But there is no alternative
Please try to understand Mother

814
01:34:51,585 --> 01:34:54,554
-Where are my belongings!
-Warden wants you

815
01:34:58,092 --> 01:34:59,559
Do you think it's
your father's property?

816
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:02,058
Aren't you ashamed
to eat free of cost?

817
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:03,829
Pay money and collect your things

818
01:35:04,098 --> 01:35:07,067
You have no money
but have enough tears

819
01:35:07,768 --> 01:35:11,067
You should quit studies and come home

820
01:35:13,941 --> 01:35:17,069
-No one is here -No, our
information is correct

821
01:35:17,178 --> 01:35:19,408
-Okay -Dhanraj's
men are coming there

822
01:35:22,283 --> 01:35:27,414
Sorry mom Education is my life
Hence l am committing suicide

823
01:35:42,803 --> 01:35:44,270
Nothing to cheer about

824
01:35:44,638 --> 01:35:48,096
l'm not even allowed
to live or die comfortably

825
01:36:24,178 --> 01:36:25,304
When is Nizamduddin
Express expected?

826
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:27,474
ls it 2 hours late?

827
01:36:31,519 --> 01:36:32,645
ls there a train before that?

828
01:36:34,688 --> 01:36:36,986
AP express? When? ln 2 minutes?

829
01:36:39,193 --> 01:36:40,217
ls it on track no2?

830
01:36:43,197 --> 01:36:44,164
lt is on track no2

831
01:36:48,869 --> 01:36:51,167
No one is pained by my death

832
01:37:41,255 --> 01:37:47,558
<i>ls e</i>v<i>eryt</i>h<i>ing an illusi</i>o<i>n?</i>
<i>Life is s</i>o <i>dark</i>

833
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:53,557
Hey, you
Am l a laughing stock?

834
01:37:53,934 --> 01:37:59,395
You make enquiries of train
timings instead of saving a girl?

835
01:38:00,941 --> 01:38:04,900
You enjoy watching it like
a movie? Sing songs too?

836
01:38:08,949 --> 01:38:10,576
Do you know, how
many problems l have?

837
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:12,583
That's why you came to die
Die

838
01:38:14,455 --> 01:38:15,820
You are not the only
one who has problems

839
01:38:15,956 --> 01:38:18,083
Everyone on earth have problems

840
01:38:20,294 --> 01:38:21,761
Life isn't a bed of roses

841
01:38:21,962 --> 01:38:23,691
You cannot expect happiness eternally

842
01:38:23,797 --> 01:38:25,594
You must learn to endure pain too

843
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:28,598
Only such people have
the right to be alive

844
01:38:30,304 --> 01:38:31,703
Cowards like you
don't dese<i>rv</i>e to be alive

845
01:38:31,805 --> 01:38:33,102
Go die if you are afraid

846
01:38:34,475 --> 01:38:36,943
Earth is what rotates, fire is what burns
One who fights is a human being

847
01:38:37,311 --> 01:38:39,609
Fight back with life,
not with me

848
01:39:54,555 --> 01:39:59,515
Ghani, let go off me
Forgive me Don't kill me

849
01:40:05,065 --> 01:40:09,195
You aren't the only one to
have troubles Everyone has

850
01:40:11,238 --> 01:40:14,537
Life isn't a bed of roses
Cannot expect happiness forever

851
01:40:14,742 --> 01:40:16,539
One must learn to endure pain too

852
01:40:17,411 --> 01:40:20,380
Only such people have
the right to be alive

853
01:40:21,415 --> 01:40:24,043
Earth is what rotates, fire is what burns
One who fights is a human being

854
01:40:24,418 --> 01:40:26,716
Fight back with life
if you're a human being

855
01:40:58,786 --> 01:41:00,083
Why is there a change
in you today?

856
01:41:00,287 --> 01:41:02,653
Change is a natural
process Let's go

857
01:41:04,958 --> 01:41:08,655
-Rakhi gang is coming
-So? -He is coming close

858
01:41:09,463 --> 01:41:12,091
-Shut up and keep walking
-Stop

859
01:41:20,908 --> 01:41:23,103
All of you take out money
You, you too

860
01:41:26,313 --> 01:41:27,211
Take it

861
01:41:29,316 --> 01:41:32,945
First time in life
l'm unable to fix rate for a girl

862
01:41:34,321 --> 01:41:36,289
This is not enough
l'll come again, tomorrow

863
01:41:42,663 --> 01:41:46,292
Ask if your sister
accepts this rate, you rascal

864
01:41:56,343 --> 01:41:59,141
Have you gone mad?
You know he is a devil

865
01:41:59,346 --> 01:42:01,814
So? Should l
tolerate his nonsense?

866
01:42:02,349 --> 01:42:04,977
He is a dangerous fellow
Let's go to hostel

867
01:42:05,185 --> 01:42:06,311
l won't come
l've to go to lab

868
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:08,388
Do as you please
We won't stay here

869
01:42:08,522 --> 01:42:09,819
-As you please
-Let's go

870
01:42:14,194 --> 01:42:17,163
lndu, please, listen to me

871
01:42:17,698 --> 01:42:20,496
You better listen
They are bad men

872
01:42:21,201 --> 01:42:23,829
Don't mess with them. You remember
what they did to Neelam

873
01:42:27,875 --> 01:42:29,843
Ghani, l'm scared

874
01:42:30,711 --> 01:42:33,509
You told me to die if l'm
scared l want to live

875
01:42:34,114 --> 01:42:35,012
Give me courage

876
01:43:44,117 --> 01:43:45,414
Hit the rascals
Beat them up

877
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:31,791
Very good! You stood 1st
from 1st year to final year

878
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,630
Why do you have to work here
to complete your education?

879
01:44:38,338 --> 01:44:42,866
Corporate hospitals will
welcome you with open arms

880
01:44:44,511 --> 01:44:47,878
You can study and
earn a lot as well there

881
01:44:49,016 --> 01:44:50,483
May l recommend
you to someone there?

882
01:44:51,018 --> 01:44:55,978
No, Baba Until yesterday
l thought only l've problems

883
01:44:56,356 --> 01:45:01,157
But, someone told me
everyone has problems

884
01:45:02,529 --> 01:45:07,330
l came here to face them
plus share others problems too

885
01:45:07,534 --> 01:45:09,502
Give me an opportunity to do it

886
01:45:09,803 --> 01:45:12,670
Okay, you may stay
here henceforth

887
01:45:27,054 --> 01:45:30,023
Madam lndira, professor
Nanda is calling you

888
01:45:40,901 --> 01:45:43,529
How dare you fight with us?
Where did you get the courage?

889
01:45:44,071 --> 01:45:48,440
Rakhi is in hospital Do you know
who we are and our background?

890
01:45:49,242 --> 01:45:53,201
Do you know Blade Bunty?
Chandni Chowk Mastan Pehalwan?

891
01:45:54,481 --> 01:45:55,448
Do you know Ghani?

892
01:46:00,253 --> 01:46:05,054
Hold me Come on Don't
you want to live? Touch me

893
01:46:06,259 --> 01:46:07,385
He will hack you to pieces

894
01:46:07,928 --> 01:46:12,297
Running away, you cowards
Come back

895
01:46:16,269 --> 01:46:18,396
Ghani, are you such a big rowdy?

896
01:46:19,439 --> 01:46:21,236
And spoke such
philosophy that day!

897
01:46:28,215 --> 01:46:29,239
Her hands should be cut off

898
01:46:29,349 --> 01:46:31,749
-Must remember it whole life,
understand? -Ghani is coming

899
01:46:32,786 --> 01:46:35,755
Brother, Dhanraj's men
attacked us on Dariyagunj bridge

900
01:46:36,123 --> 01:46:38,591
We escaped but
Giri received a bullet

901
01:46:38,892 --> 01:46:39,756
He is undergoing
operation inside

902
01:46:40,026 --> 01:46:42,426
This area inspector is
talking of filing case

903
01:46:42,629 --> 01:46:45,928
-Uncle will take care of it
-You sit there l'll go, talk

904
01:46:49,469 --> 01:46:52,529
Hello sir
-Fine what's the news?

905
01:47:04,918 --> 01:47:06,283
He didn't recognise me!

906
01:47:10,323 --> 01:47:11,950
That area inspector is
giving trouble

907
01:47:12,092 --> 01:47:14,959
Brother, tea -Our men
drew out guns on the bridge

908
01:47:15,495 --> 01:47:18,794
in front of public
A press man saw it

909
01:47:19,666 --> 01:47:22,134
Find out if he wants more
money Pay him his demand

910
01:47:30,343 --> 01:47:31,139
Tea?

911
01:47:35,015 --> 01:47:38,815
Do you recognise me?
Me, the railway tracks?

912

My college is close by

915
01:47:52,032 --> 01:47:53,158
You, get lost

918
01:48:08,682 --> 01:48:09,512
What will you say?

919
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:16,854
Don't force anyone
Accept whatever is given

920
01:48:17,724 --> 01:48:18,520
Okay, sister

921
01:48:33,173 --> 01:48:34,697
-Look at the girl
-Which girl?

922
01:48:34,908 --> 01:48:40,039
Girl at the hospital
Poor girl is begging

923
01:48:47,587 --> 01:48:53,548
lt's her! Why is she here?
Why should we bother anyway?

924
01:48:53,927 --> 01:48:57,055
Why do you interfere in
other's matters? Do what is told

925
01:49:04,371 --> 01:49:05,895
Help the homeless, please

926
01:49:06,673 --> 01:49:07,571
Give her the money

927
01:49:12,946 --> 01:49:14,573
We gave you already
Why do you force again?

928
01:49:18,618 --> 01:49:21,746
Sinners are forgiven
by act of charity

929
01:49:23,623 --> 01:49:24,419
l'm talking to you

930
01:49:39,973 --> 01:49:44,103
-What did she say? -Sinners

01:49:44,311 --> 01:49:48,941
-Who is she to say so?
-You have given money

932
01:49:51,318 --> 01:49:52,615
You have given money

933
01:49:55,655 --> 01:49:57,782
Hey you, come here

934
01:50:01,261 --> 01:50:02,125

-What did you say just now?

936
01:50:05,498 --> 01:50:09,298
-Sinners are. . . -Do you

937
01:50:09,436 --> 01:50:10,562
What do you know
about me anyway?

938
01:50:11,338 --> 01:50:15,297
Don't mess with me

941
01:50:38,632 --> 01:50:39,428

-Why do you look dull?
-She is afraid about exams

946
01:51:01,721 --> 01:51:03,018
You better die
if you are afraid

947
01:51:04,057 --> 01:51:07,754
Cowards have no right to live
Earth is what rotates

948
01:51:07,894 --> 01:51:10,124
Fire is what burns.
One who fights is a human being

949
01:51:10,397 --> 01:51:12,194
lf you are a human,
fight with life

950
01:51:13,066 --> 01:51:15,193
Where does the poetry come
in the picture? -Just like that

951
01:51:25,578 --> 01:51:27,705
Don't giggle
Control yourself

952
01:51:28,682 --> 01:51:31,310
Let's go to some other restaurant
What happened suddenly?

953
01:51:33,253 --> 01:51:35,653
A big fight will take
place here soon

954
01:51:36,423 --> 01:51:37,219
How did you know?

955
01:51:37,757 --> 01:51:39,884
The man over there is a big goon

956
01:51:44,164 --> 01:51:44,994
He looks handsome

957
01:51:46,566 --> 01:51:51,230
l said he is a goon, not a hero
-Don't you like action movies?

958
01:51:53,540 --> 01:51:54,666
Let's go, get up

959
01:51:57,444 --> 01:51:58,240
We knew it

960
01:52:03,783 --> 01:52:08,584
Uncle, Ghani is sitting there
This girl is getting away

961
01:52:08,888 --> 01:52:11,186
She acted as if she
knew Ghani well

962
01:52:13,626 --> 01:52:17,585
You fooled us! Let's teach
you a lesson in the college

963
01:52:18,631 --> 01:52:19,757
Why did you stop?

964
01:52:36,750 --> 01:52:39,116
She told us he is a goon
Why is she offering him a cool drink?

965
01:52:40,653 --> 01:52:44,282
l touch your feet but
don't tell me to get out

966
01:52:46,493 --> 01:52:47,960
Drink this Pepsi quietly

967
01:52:50,497 --> 01:52:56,458
No, let us talk
Okay, l'll do the talking

968
01:52:57,170 --> 01:53:00,571
That guy in the yellow coat,
over there

969
01:53:02,342 --> 01:53:04,810
You wore the same
colour coat that day

970
01:53:05,178 --> 01:53:07,146
She is telling him about me?

971
01:53:07,514 --> 01:53:10,244
Look at the one in
orange shirt, over there

972
01:53:10,450 --> 01:53:11,974
She is telling him about me?

973
01:53:14,354 --> 01:53:17,323
l wore that coloured
dress on that day

974
01:53:17,857 --> 01:53:18,653
Let us go

975
01:53:47,554 --> 01:53:48,521
What do you want?

976
01:53:49,823 --> 01:53:51,017
Enough laughing

Keep aside the greetings
and handle Shantibaba first

1000
01:58:52,525 --> 01:58:54,152
He is robbing me of
my peace of mind

1001
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:55,324
What happened?

1002
01:58:55,461 --> 01:58:58,828
He appealed to supreme court
to sack me from the ministry

1003
01:58:59,031 --> 01:59:01,829
He accused me of
embezzling his trust money

1004
01:59:02,034 --> 01:59:05,265
l agree l did it
But l'm not alone in it

1005
01:59:05,538 --> 01:59:07,665
Doesn't he have to
consider my difficulties too

1006
01:59:09,275 --> 01:59:10,674
l'm maintaining 3 families

1007
01:59:11,310 --> 01:59:15,679
So, l offered him 2 crores
and requested him to let me go

1008
01:59:16,883 --> 01:59:20,683
But he said he won't sleep
till he sees me out of ministry

1009
01:59:21,387 --> 01:59:24,117
l'll talk to him -That's
the reason l came to you

1010
01:59:24,323 --> 01:59:26,018
Do something and silence him

1011
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:28,850
lt's time to go to parliament
Bye

1012
01:59:32,832 --> 01:59:35,266
Ghani is in Nagpur
Should we call him here?

1013
01:59:35,701 --> 01:59:37,692
No
Let's hand it by ourselves

1014
01:59:52,585 --> 01:59:55,383
l'm not fighting
for money but for justice

1015
01:59:56,255 --> 01:59:58,883
Such a person isn't
worthy of that position

1016
02:00:00,426 --> 02:00:04,294
Today he cheated the destitutes
He can cheat the country tomorrow

1017
02:00:04,597 --> 02:00:09,057
So, l demanded for refund
of 6 crores and his resignation

1018
02:00:09,268 --> 02:00:12,567
How can we recover money after
he loses position?

1019
02:00:13,606 --> 02:00:16,575
Naidu, you tell him
Try to understand, Baba

1020
02:00:17,276 --> 02:00:20,245
We will extract money
from him but in installments

1021
02:00:21,447 --> 02:00:26,578
l prepared papers to
withdraw the case Sign them

1022
02:00:28,221 --> 02:00:31,588
Get out -Baba
-Please Get out

1023
02:00:31,791 --> 02:00:37,252
l go out! -Please
-Baba -go out

1024
02:00:37,463 --> 02:00:39,931
Try to understand
-Get out l say

1025
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:42,594
Pistol is empty

1026
02:00:47,807 --> 02:00:49,274
You want me go out?

1027
02:00:56,582 --> 02:01:02,612
Our father is dead
Listen My father is dead

1028
02:01:21,007 --> 02:01:23,635
Come on, lock them up
inside and set them on fire

1029
02:01:36,022 --> 02:01:39,480
Khan, don't do it
lt's a great sin

1030
02:02:27,073 --> 02:02:28,370
Come on, hurry up

1031
02:02:28,741 --> 02:02:29,537
How did it happen?

1032
02:02:32,244 --> 02:02:33,040
Bring water

1033
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:35,510
How did it happen, sir?

1034
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:38,549
Due to the short circuit
last night in the home

1035
02:02:39,418 --> 02:02:42,546
We estimate around 200
people died including Baba

1036
02:02:43,756 --> 02:02:45,383
Do you believe short
circuit is the reason?

1037
02:02:46,859 --> 02:02:48,884
Baba filed a case in supreme
court against a central minister

1038
02:02:49,061 --> 02:02:49,993
Does that have any connection to this

1039
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:57,399
What happened? -This isn't
short circuit but

1040
02:02:57,770 --> 02:02:58,896
a cold blooded murder

1041
02:02:59,271 --> 02:03:04,573
Baba and kids are killed
ruthlessly l witnessed it

1042
02:03:06,846 --> 02:03:08,905
We su<i>rv</i>ived as we threw
these children into water tank. . .

1043
02:03:09,448 --> 02:03:11,245
. . .and we hid ourselves

1044
02:03:11,450 --> 02:03:15,750
Do you know the killer? -No but
can recognise him if l see him

1045
02:03:29,735 --> 02:03:31,600
What's this?
Have you watched TV

1046
02:03:31,971 --> 02:03:33,598
This isn't what l told you to do

1047
02:03:33,806 --> 02:03:35,831
That girl has seen you
in the ashram (home)

1048
02:03:36,041 --> 02:03:39,442
lf she recognises you l'll be
thrown into Tihar jail too

1049
02:03:39,745 --> 02:03:43,613
She won't recognise me Leave
this matter to me, understand?

1050
02:03:44,583 --> 02:03:46,107
l did it once and
this is the result

1051
02:03:46,318 --> 02:03:47,945
Do it right this time atleast

1052
02:03:48,487 --> 02:03:51,285
Police kept that girl in
police guest house

1053
02:03:54,927 --> 02:03:56,224
Send for Ghani

1054
02:04:11,510 --> 02:04:15,139
How did it happened?
Who is responsible for it?

1055
02:04:16,515 --> 02:04:17,982
Uncle, who is responsible for it?

1056
02:04:31,964 --> 02:04:32,760
This girl!

1057
02:04:34,033 --> 02:04:36,331
Do you know her?
-Not me but Ghani knows her

1058
02:04:36,535 --> 02:04:37,661
They are lovers l believe

1059
02:04:40,005 --> 02:04:43,338
-Love!
-lsn't it? -ls it not?

1060
02:04:47,046 --> 02:04:53,508
Who said it is love? Who?
What do you know?

1061
02:05:01,160 --> 02:05:04,960
Who do you think he is?
He is my son

1062
02:05:11,370 --> 02:05:16,034
For me to live, she
has to die, understand?

1063
02:05:21,580 --> 02:05:25,141
No need to be afraid You
have to stay here for 5 days

1064
02:05:25,918 --> 02:05:27,385
We have made all
arrangements for it

1065
02:05:28,754 --> 02:05:30,881
May l make a phone call
to my house?

1066
02:05:31,090 --> 02:05:34,218
Sorry you cannot contact
anyone from here

1067
02:06:27,646 --> 02:06:28,943
Have you come to see me?

1068
02:06:32,318 --> 02:06:36,618
Have you come to see me?
Don't go down

1069
02:06:39,058 --> 02:06:41,618
Security is tight They will
shoot you if they see you

1070
02:06:41,827 --> 02:06:48,391
Go away l'll come there
Go down

1071
02:07:04,016 --> 02:07:07,816
l heard some noise from above
You go inside Let's check

1072
02:07:21,367 --> 02:07:24,768
What happened brother?
-She is going to come

1073
02:07:25,037 --> 02:07:27,665
Why will she come? She must
have informed police by now

1074
02:07:28,374 --> 02:07:29,170
Go

1075
02:07:31,510 --> 02:07:35,503
You were right Look at her
come running to die

1076
02:07:35,881 --> 02:07:38,509
ls the gun ready?
Police is all around Be careful

1077
02:07:38,884 --> 02:07:40,852
l'll be waiting there
Do it in one shot

1078
02:07:47,326 --> 02:07:51,194
l cannot believe it
Have you come to see me

1079
02:07:51,563 --> 02:07:52,860
on seeing the newspaper
TV and news?

1080
02:07:53,999 --> 02:07:56,866
l've not done it but the
inspiration l got from you

1081
02:07:59,905 --> 02:08:01,964
l used to be afraid
of even a small lizard

1082
02:08:02,675 --> 02:08:06,543
But your words that day
have changed my entire life

1083
02:08:09,248 --> 02:08:13,548
lt isn't me who is fighting
against the devil Khan but. . .

1084
02:08:14,086 --> 02:08:18,489
. . .you Do you know

1085
02:08:20,426 --> 02:08:21,222
Baba and. . .

1086
02:08:39,445 --> 02:08:41,572
He threatened to kill me if
l give statement against him

1087
02:08:42,114 --> 02:08:46,414
l'm not scared No one can harm
me as long as you are here

1088
02:08:49,955 --> 02:08:53,254
Who do you think he is?
He is my son

1089
02:09:39,304 --> 02:09:40,965
He warned you but
you didn't care

1090
02:09:41,240 --> 02:09:43,902
Look what happened now
You will go to jail, be hanged

1091
02:09:44,343 --> 02:09:47,141
You thought he is your son
Look what is he doing

1092
02:10:07,533 --> 02:10:10,832
Ghani, why didn't you kill her?

1093
02:10:13,872 --> 02:10:17,330
Why should l kill her?

1094
02:10:19,411 --> 02:10:22,869
Wasn't it wicked to
kill innocent children?

1095
02:10:24,216 --> 02:10:25,740
What you did is wrong

1096
02:10:26,552 --> 02:10:28,486
l didn't kill her so that
another wrong isn't committed

1097
02:10:28,887 --> 02:10:30,684
Yes, what l did is wrong

1098
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:36,357
Yes, it is wrong

1099
02:10:42,534 --> 02:10:43,330
lt is wrong!

1100
02:11:08,927 --> 02:11:10,952
You wanted to kill me, right? -No

1101
02:11:11,163 --> 02:11:14,564
One needs guts not guns to kill me

1102
02:11:15,434 --> 02:11:18,460
You -l'm a dog
raised by you, right?

1103
02:11:20,772 --> 02:11:25,903
You -l did without questions
whatever you asked me to

1104
02:11:26,445 --> 02:11:28,743
But now, l'll kill those
who interfere with that girl

1105
02:11:38,523 --> 02:11:42,755
l'm not scared No one can
harm me as long as you here

1106
02:11:54,907 --> 02:11:55,703
Speak, uncle

1107
02:12:01,813 --> 02:12:02,609
Greetings, sir

1108
02:12:13,091 --> 02:12:16,618
Why are you crying?
Because Ghani didn't kill you?

1109
02:12:18,563 --> 02:12:21,293
He didn't kill you hence
l'm given that job

1110
02:12:22,834 --> 02:12:28,830
5 crores! l cannot earn that even
after 10 births and as a police

1111
02:12:30,575 --> 02:12:33,635
l'll kill you but Ghani
will be accused of it

1112
02:12:35,847 --> 02:12:39,977
Sorry, dear forgive me

1113
02:12:59,871 --> 02:13:01,998
As per the defence witness in the
incident at Shantibaba home

1114
02:13:02,207 --> 02:13:05,506
the court believes Latif alias
Khan Bhai is involved in it

1115
02:13:05,711 --> 02:13:08,373
Hence the court orders Delhi
police to arrest him and. . .

1116
02:13:08,580 --> 02:13:10,946
. . .orders CBl to enquire
into the case and. . .

1117
02:13:11,149 --> 02:13:14,516
. . .submit it's report
within 3 months

1118
02:13:24,162 --> 02:13:25,094
Why are you crying?

1119
02:13:27,899 --> 02:13:33,030
Everyone wants to kill me
l don't know whom to believe

1120
02:13:36,742 --> 02:13:41,645
l don't care who kills me

1121
02:13:42,748 --> 02:13:46,081
But l'm unable to
cope up with the fact that. . .

1122
02:13:46,918 --> 02:13:51,116
. . .the person who inspired
me came to kill me

1123
02:13:53,191 --> 02:13:54,158
What happened in the end?

1124
02:13:56,428 --> 02:13:58,259
My trust has saved me

1125
02:14:06,104 --> 02:14:08,664
Get down
Get down from the vehicle

1126
02:14:09,341 --> 02:14:11,400
What mistake Have l done?
Get down

1127
02:14:26,058 --> 02:14:28,083
Oh God! Why have you
pushed down the jeep?

1128
02:14:28,460 --> 02:14:30,360
Traveling in that jeep
isn't safe for us

1129
02:14:32,130 --> 02:14:34,462
You gave witness in the court

1130
02:14:34,966 --> 02:14:36,934
No one should know
your future whereabouts

1131
02:14:37,469 --> 02:14:41,428
lf they find out both you and
your family will be in danger

1132
02:14:41,907 --> 02:14:43,932
-What about my studies?
-You are more concerned about. . .

1133
02:14:44,042 --> 02:14:46,772
. . .studies than life!

When do we meet again?

What if l feel like talking
to you? -No need to do that

1154
02:18:59,230 --> 02:19:01,095
What is the meaning of ABCDEFG?

1155
02:19:01,299 --> 02:19:03,028
l don't have to tell you

1156
02:19:10,075 --> 02:19:13,442
You don't appear other than
on TV and in newspaper

1157
02:19:13,645 --> 02:19:16,512
Mother is worrying about you
you know? Who is he?

1158
02:19:19,417 --> 02:19:21,544
Classmate! Then he must
be a doctor too

1159
02:19:24,622 --> 02:19:26,385
You take him inside

1162
02:19:44,943 --> 02:19:47,411
Sister, how are you?
We were worried about you

1163
02:19:48,279 --> 02:19:50,611
She is my younger sister
-Greetings Come with me sister

1164
02:19:51,616 --> 02:19:53,914
Mother must be worried

02:20:34,592 --> 02:20:35,456
What is the matter, Mother?

1169
02:20:35,827 --> 02:20:37,818
You are asking me?
Why did you give witness?

1170
02:20:38,029 --> 02:20:39,223
Why do you have
to care about others?

1171
02:20:39,431 --> 02:20:41,126
We have already lost
your father and your brother

1172
02:20:41,332 --> 02:20:45,735
Haven't you learnt a lesson?
We ran away from town for our lives

1173
02:20:46,271 --> 02:20:48,967
Where do we hide
now for what you did?

1174
02:20:49,174 --> 02:20:52,143
Why to run away?
Why to be afraid of someone?

1175
02:20:52,544 --> 02:20:55,377
They will chase us
as long as we are scared

1176
02:20:55,847 --> 02:20:58,577
The day we rebel,
they will be scared of us

1177
02:20:59,851 --> 02:21:02,149
Your father just did that
What's the consequence?

1178
02:21:03,188 --> 02:21:06,487
We were rendered orphans -That
is long ago lt is different now

1179
02:21:07,125 --> 02:21:09,355
Watch how l'll drag
him to the roads and

1180
02:21:10,028 --> 02:21:12,462
do what our father
wanted to do

1181
02:21:14,866 --> 02:21:17,164
-How did you get such guts?
-Because of Ghani

1182
02:21:19,704 --> 02:21:23,071
l'm not the old lndu anymore
but lndira Priyadarshini now

1183
02:21:25,877 --> 02:21:27,276
They lived a good life once

1184
02:21:27,879 --> 02:21:31,975
lndu wants to go back to Hyderabad
and fulfil her father's wish

1185
02:21:32,884 --> 02:21:36,012
How is that possible?
Brother, mother is calling

1186
02:21:37,555 --> 02:21:38,385
Let's eat

1187
02:21:43,394 --> 02:21:46,192
-What? -What happened?
-What happened means?

1188
02:21:47,999 --> 02:21:52,868
You never told me that
you people ran away from Hyderabad

1189
02:21:53,505 --> 02:21:58,602
Why should l tell you? You
never gave me a chance to speak

1190
02:21:59,677 --> 02:22:01,542
How can l guess you can
understand my problems. . .

1191
02:22:01,746 --> 02:22:03,976
. . .when you cannot
understand my feelings?

1192
02:22:04,682 --> 02:22:06,309
Have you ever told me
about yourself?

1193
02:22:07,585 --> 02:22:12,045
l tried a lot to talk
to you, to know about you

1194
02:22:12,924 --> 02:22:17,759
Have you ever given
me a straight answer?

1195
02:22:17,962 --> 02:22:19,657
What do l tell you?

1196
02:22:21,900 --> 02:22:25,392
That my own father sold
me for 50/- for alcohol?

1197
02:22:26,771 --> 02:22:29,239
That someone has raised
me with selfish motives?

1198
02:22:30,909 --> 02:22:33,104
Should l tell you that l didn't
know what's good or bad?

1199
02:22:34,779 --> 02:22:36,076
l've nothing to say about me

1200
02:22:40,952 --> 02:22:42,351
lf there is something
that is worth mentioning,. . .

1201
02:22:43,621 --> 02:22:44,918
. . .that is the two days
l spent with you

1202
02:22:45,957 --> 02:22:50,587
l've nothing more to say

1203
02:22:52,964 --> 02:22:58,129
l'm not a good guy
l don't dese<i>rv</i>e to meet your eyes

1204
02:22:59,470 --> 02:23:03,497
Man like me needs to be
punished not loved

1205
02:23:05,310 --> 02:23:07,835
l'm not a nice person
No

1206
02:23:08,479 --> 02:23:10,606
l know what you are

1207
02:23:11,649 --> 02:23:13,879
Your goodness shows
in your confession

1208
02:23:14,819 --> 02:23:17,344
Your goodness shows
in your words itself

1209
02:23:18,323 --> 02:23:21,019
You think of the bad past

1210
02:23:22,827 --> 02:23:25,193
Why not think of good future?

1211
02:23:26,331 --> 02:23:31,667
-l'll be.. -lndu, you can
talk later. Eat first

1212
02:23:34,339 --> 02:23:35,328
Please, come

1213
02:23:38,610 --> 02:23:40,976
Didn't you ask me what is
the meaning of ABCDEFG?

1214
02:23:44,182 --> 02:23:44,978
Will you do it?

1215
02:24:09,707 --> 02:24:11,504
What is the commotion in
the kitchen so early morning?

1216
02:24:11,709 --> 02:24:13,108
lf you want coffee, l. . .

1217
02:24:18,383 --> 02:24:19,179
He is gone!

1218
02:24:22,086 --> 02:24:23,713
Have you expected him to stay?

1219
02:25:01,426 --> 02:25:02,791
l was searching for
you all over the town

1220
02:25:02,994 --> 02:25:05,053
You are sitting here
looking at Taj Mahal?

1221
02:25:05,263 --> 02:25:09,029
You left without telling anyone

1222
02:25:10,768 --> 02:25:13,066
Do you know the tension
you caused by going missing?

1223
02:25:14,272 --> 02:25:17,139
You should have gone
What are you waiting for? Go

1224
02:25:20,611 --> 02:25:22,738
No one will miss you Go

1225
02:25:24,882 --> 02:25:29,080
-Hey, do you really
want me to go? -Yes

1226
02:25:30,388 --> 02:25:33,380
-Look at me at say it
-Go away

1227
02:25:35,293 --> 02:25:39,423
-Go -Really?
-Go away

1228
02:25:42,300 --> 02:25:46,361
Mumtaz, you are the witness

1229
02:25:46,971 --> 02:25:49,531
lf this girl really loves me. . .

1230
02:25:52,477 --> 02:25:55,844
. . .she should come running to
hug me by the count of three

1231
02:25:59,584 --> 02:26:00,448
One. . .

1232
02:26:02,820 --> 02:26:03,616
Two. . .

1233
02:26:07,492 --> 02:26:08,288
211/2. . .

1234
02:26:10,828 --> 02:26:12,295
211/2 once

1235
02:26:16,501 --> 02:26:17,832
211/2 twice

1236
02:26:20,671 --> 02:26:22,298
211/2 thrice

1237
02:26:25,009 --> 02:26:25,805
Three. . .

1238
02:27:47,925 --> 02:27:51,554
Go away
Go away from here

1239
02:27:52,463 --> 02:27:54,522
We will do that
Let's go to hospital first

1240
02:27:55,166 --> 02:27:59,227
l cannot -Don't say so
-l'm going away

1241
02:28:00,104 --> 02:28:03,938
Don't say so

1242
02:28:07,278 --> 02:28:10,577
l dreamed of life with you

1243
02:28:11,449 --> 02:28:12,245
But. . .

1244
02:28:14,952 --> 02:28:17,921
Why did this happen?

1245
02:29:36,367 --> 02:29:41,498
Since that day, Balu
change his life style for us

1246
02:29:41,706 --> 02:29:43,731
But, this is. . .

1247
02:29:52,216 --> 02:29:54,116
The problem was because of the
bullet got lodged in his body

1248
02:29:54,318 --> 02:29:56,343
We have removed that now
But he lost lot of blood

1249
02:29:56,687 --> 02:29:57,779
Shift him to another hospital

1250
02:29:57,989 --> 02:29:59,889
Not just the hospital
but we will leave the town

1251
02:30:00,091 --> 02:30:02,525
Bujji, make arrangements to shift

1252
02:30:03,561 --> 02:30:07,554
Mother l won't come
You may go away

1253
02:30:07,898 --> 02:30:11,356
-Why? -To register the
documents in these peoples names

1254
02:30:11,569 --> 02:30:14,595
Enough! We have done
enough, they will do the rest

1255
02:30:14,805 --> 02:30:15,863
We have to go away
from here first

1256
02:30:16,407 --> 02:30:18,102
How to leave without
fulfilling lndu's wish

1257
02:30:18,476 --> 02:30:21,377
Who are you to do that?
What way are we related?

1258
02:30:21,579 --> 02:30:23,979
You go away from here
-Mother! -Of course

1259
02:30:24,582 --> 02:30:26,140
He won't oblige

1260
02:30:26,350 --> 02:30:29,786
l've lost my daughter, l cannot
afford to loose this son too

1261
02:30:30,921 --> 02:30:33,549
Those demons will come
here too

1262
02:30:35,259 --> 02:30:36,886
They are looking for you
all over the town

1263
02:30:37,395 --> 02:30:39,056
Hence, l had to hide
you here

1264
02:30:39,430 --> 02:30:41,830
They won't let you live
Listen to me

1265
02:30:42,033 --> 02:30:46,163
You trusted me this far
Trust me once more

1266
02:30:47,438 --> 02:30:50,635
Nothing will happen to me
Believe me

1267
02:30:58,215 --> 02:30:59,807
Will you do me a favor?

1268
02:31:08,626 --> 02:31:11,595
Brother, police raided
our den at Kailash market

1269
02:31:11,796 --> 02:31:15,960
Khanbhai, our Rasul gang is
caught redhanded in Khandala port

1270
02:31:16,167 --> 02:31:20,934
Police gets information
about us from Hyderabad

1271
02:31:22,973 --> 02:31:27,603
He is beaten by a meek

1272
02:31:27,812 --> 02:31:31,942
Khan is finished
Clap for him

1273
02:31:37,488 --> 02:31:40,946
Brother, l've searched all hospital
He isn't there in any of them

1274
02:31:43,727 --> 02:31:45,786
That girl from Delhi is none
other than Rajeswari's daughter

1275
02:31:50,501 --> 02:31:53,732
Come on, take out the vehicles

1276
02:32:22,366 --> 02:32:23,333
Go, find him

1277
02:32:28,706 --> 02:32:31,368
Search upstairs
-He isn't here

1278
02:32:36,881 --> 02:32:37,677
Not here too

1279
02:34:09,240 --> 02:34:10,207
You. . .

1280
02:35:31,322 --> 02:35:33,017
lndu's wish is fulfilled

1281
02:35:35,392 --> 02:35:37,223
Only job now left is, to kill you

1282
02:35:39,396 --> 02:35:40,886
l'll complete that too

1283
02:35:51,075 --> 02:35:54,806
Hit me Come on, hit me

1284
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:58,207
Come on, hit me

1285
02:36:03,754 --> 02:36:05,449
Come on, hit me

1286
02:36:13,764 --> 02:36:15,231
Come on, hit me

1287
02:36:31,548 --> 02:36:32,344
Hit me

Come on, hit me
Come on. . .

1289
02:36:36,653 --> 02:36:41,590
Come on, hit me
Come on. . .

1290
02:36:56,473 --> 02:37:00,068
l let my blood lived
on you, drain out

1291
02:37:01,478 --> 02:37:05,437
Now all that left is vengeance
and you, standing in front of me

1292
02:38:06,376 --> 02:38:12,337
Kill him! Kill him!

1293
02:38:12,549 --> 02:38:18,510
Kill him! Kill him!

1294
02:38:43,580 --> 02:38:49,541
Kill him! Kill him!

1295
02:38:49,753 --> 02:38:52,119
Kill him
Ghani, don't

One can wait eternally,
to be loved by a man like you
