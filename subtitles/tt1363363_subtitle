00:02:12,363 --> 00:02:14,593
Hello! Chatur Singh 2 Stars Office.

2
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:16,528
I am speaking from A-One Refrigerator.

3
00:02:16,634 --> 00:02:18,101
Did you order the refrigerator.

4
00:02:18,202 --> 00:02:20,193
Yes, we booked the refirigerator. Please send it
soon,

5
00:02:20,305 --> 00:02:23,138
We're tired of drinking hot water. -Please tell me
your address.

6
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:24,299
Address?

7
00:02:25,576 --> 00:02:27,510
32/24..

8
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:31,746
..Police Colony, Dadar West.

9
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:32,838
Thank you, sir.

10
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:35,219
It's Yadav's number.

11
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,783
Last time when we booked a mixer you gave
Yadav's number.

12
00:02:39,257 --> 00:02:41,782
You paid the EMl and Yadav was enjoying that
mixer.

13
00:02:41,893 --> 00:02:42,882
What are you doing?

14
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:48,561
Pappu! You forgot it.

15
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:51,665
Colonel Shakki always said that..

16
00:02:52,437 --> 00:02:58,205
..a great detective should never tell his name and
address.

17
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:02,573
The first law of espionage.

18
00:03:03,915 --> 00:03:07,749
The snack in the right hand shouldn't know..

19
00:03:07,852 --> 00:03:10,343
..that how much sugar has been added..

20
00:03:10,488 --> 00:03:12,581
..to the tea cup in the left hand.

21
00:03:15,226 --> 00:03:16,454
Forget all that, boss.

22
00:03:16,561 --> 00:03:19,860
What are you making me do? Attacking you over
and over again.

23
00:03:20,131 --> 00:03:21,462
I don't like this.

24
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:23,756
Pappu.

25
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,297
A great detective should..

26
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:29,673
..be alert..

27
00:03:32,477 --> 00:03:33,842
..24 x 7.

28
00:03:38,249 --> 00:03:39,648
Oh! -Where are you going?

29
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:41,582
To open the door, it must be milk man.

30
00:03:45,456 --> 00:03:46,787
Without any protection?

31
00:03:49,794 --> 00:03:52,490
Who are you? What's your name?

32
00:03:52,864 --> 00:03:53,922
What's your job?

33
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:56,425
What's your address? What's your phone number?

34
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:58,263
Control boss!

35
00:03:58,469 --> 00:03:59,458
Sorry.

36
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:01,594
Who are you?

37
00:04:02,106 --> 00:04:05,542
I am Dilip Kumar Yadav,

38
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:08,703
Why did you cme here, Babban? -Not Babban, sir.

39
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,544
Dilip Kumar.. Yadav.

40
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:13,173
Who is this Babban, boss?

41
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:16,584
Every criminal is Babban for me.

42
00:04:18,322 --> 00:04:20,517
What have you brought in this, Babban?

43
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:21,847
It's milk, sir.

44
00:04:22,293 --> 00:04:23,282
Milk?

45
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:26,788
What did you mix in the milk? I didn't mix anything.

46
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:29,165
What have you mixed?

47
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:33,764
Water! -Not water, but poison has been mixed in the
milk.

48
00:04:34,205 --> 00:04:35,229
Poison?

49
00:04:37,141 --> 00:04:38,608
Drink!

50
00:04:42,346 --> 00:04:46,783
Drink!

51
00:05:00,398 --> 00:05:01,831
The hunter has become the hunted.

52
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,131
The poison is slowly taking effect.

53
00:05:06,504 --> 00:05:07,801
Pappu, ask him..

54
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,300
How do you feel, Babban?

55
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:13,677
I am really enjoying, sir.

56
00:05:15,246 --> 00:05:18,704
Had I got some bread, my breakfast would be over
here.

57
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:20,579
Boss, he is enjoying.

58
00:05:20,818 --> 00:05:21,807
Get out!

59
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:26,288
Brother Chatur!

60
00:05:26,691 --> 00:05:28,249
Shall I bring milk here tomorrow..

61
00:05:28,693 --> 00:05:30,217
..or I should drink it at home?

62
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:32,595
How do you know my name?

63
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,261
My son told me..

64
00:05:34,932 --> 00:05:37,594
..that brother Chatur is really Chatur(Smart).

65
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:39,097
Like children.

66
00:05:40,204 --> 00:05:41,796
Will you leave or should I shoot you?

67
00:05:43,741 --> 00:05:45,675
Oh god!

68
00:05:49,647 --> 00:05:52,377
Who are you? How did you come here? -Get out.
Get out.

69
00:05:53,317 --> 00:05:54,545
What a genius!

70
00:05:55,153 --> 00:05:56,882
Pappu.. -You know my name?

71
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:03,283
Boss! It's you!

72
00:06:03,394 --> 00:06:05,362
I couldn't recognize you, boss.

73
00:06:06,264 --> 00:06:09,756
Pappu, how do I look?

74
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,501
Will you thrash me if I say it?

75
00:06:14,805 --> 00:06:16,102
C'mon..

76
00:06:16,474 --> 00:06:19,204
Tell me how do I look? -You look like a pimp.

77
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:20,799
What?!

78
00:06:22,747 --> 00:06:24,305
You look exactly like a pimp!

79
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:26,815
Idiot! I am a pickpocket.

80
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:28,407
A pickpocket!

81
00:06:28,886 --> 00:06:34,347
Criminals are afraid to commit crime on seeing a
cop.

82
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:38,726
That's why I go outside in different disguises.

83
00:06:39,297 --> 00:06:43,290
So that they commit crimes and I nab them
red-handed.

84
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:46,370
Boss! You're great!

85
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,633
Why are you falling at my feet? Please, Pappu!

86
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:53,275
Boss, your bag. It has your uniform and your ID.

87
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:07,758
This means that any unclaimed thing can hold a
bomb.

88
00:07:12,697 --> 00:07:16,531
Wow! I think God heard me today.

89
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,343
Dude, can I have a betel leaf?

90
00:07:28,512 --> 00:07:30,810
I am telling you for the last time..

91
00:07:30,915 --> 00:07:33,383
..I am not a pimp but a pickpocket.

92
00:07:33,484 --> 00:07:35,418
Listen! I'm a pickpocket!

93
00:07:40,224 --> 00:07:41,748
I'm a pickpocket! Ok?

94
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,457
Careful with your purse. Keep it in.

95
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,797
Unclaimed box.

96
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,235
I am sure there is a bomb inside.

97
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:56,228
Boss, this..

98
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:19,463
There's a bomb inside this.

99
00:08:26,504 --> 00:08:28,438
Hello.

100
00:08:35,713 --> 00:08:36,702
It's flour.

101
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:40,743
This is flour.

102
00:08:42,486 --> 00:08:44,351
This is flour, brother.

103
00:08:44,455 --> 00:08:45,444
This is flour.

104
00:08:46,223 --> 00:08:47,281
Move! Move from here!

105
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:50,224
You don't need to worry.

106
00:08:51,162 --> 00:08:52,322
This area is secured.

107
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,419
Move! Move!

108
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:56,191
What security? -You have wasted my flour.

109
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,494
I had got it grounded from Goregaon.

110
00:08:57,601 --> 00:09:00,764
My conveyance, the cost of wheat, the cost of
grinding.

111
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:02,031
Give me 500.

112
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:03,663
Give him his money.

113
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:07,073
My bag! That pickpocket stole it!

114
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:08,770
Nab him!

115
00:09:09,246 --> 00:09:11,680
Just now you were saying that you're a pickpocket.

116
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:13,477
Now you're blaming others!

117
00:09:13,584 --> 00:09:16,747
I'm not a pickpocket. I'm a police officer. -A police
officer?

118
00:09:16,854 --> 00:09:19,516
He's fooling us, beat him!

119
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,768
All of you squat properly. Properly!

120
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:35,432
Squat! -Sir, we've caught a new rat.

121
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:37,200
Make him squat too!

122
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:40,734
Why squat? -It's our boss' new style.

123
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:42,610
C'mon, hurry up and..

124
00:09:43,781 --> 00:09:46,306
Oh! Who are you?

125
00:09:48,185 --> 00:09:50,813
I know you.Who are you? Who are you?

126
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:54,453
Who am I? I won't tell you.

127
00:09:54,692 --> 00:09:58,321
Your voice is familiar, tell me..

128
00:09:58,763 --> 00:10:01,197
Tell me who are you otherwise I will shoot you.

129
00:10:01,298 --> 00:10:02,424
Tell me who are you?

130
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:05,595
Shoot me or kill me.

131
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,259
I won't tell.

132
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:16,543
I know you, tell me who you are?

133
00:10:16,781 --> 00:10:20,308
You know me, and I know you.

134
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:23,519
You are Dagru from Dagru Chawl.

135
00:10:23,654 --> 00:10:26,452
Your wife calls you by this name.

136
00:10:26,824 --> 00:10:29,793
Oh! He knows about the private moments of my
life.

137
00:10:30,728 --> 00:10:31,717
Forget that..

138
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:34,921
..1 5 years back you got a red sweater in dowry.

139
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:38,593
You wear that sweater in summer like Dev Anand.

140
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,333
Oh no! He knows my sweater too!

141
00:10:41,572 --> 00:10:43,369
Let alone the sweater..

142
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:48,770
..I even know about the nylon underwear that
you're wearing.

143
00:10:49,647 --> 00:10:52,673
Underwear? How do you know so much about me?

144
00:10:53,451 --> 00:10:54,782
Sir, I'll tell you.

145
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,123
Recognize him, Chatur Singh 2 Star.

146
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,528
Depression, blood pressure, relaxation, tension,
laughter.

147
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:09,689
Which pill should I give you, sir?

148
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:13,235
These pills are thing of the past, Kulkarni.

149
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:16,166
Police commissioner RK Sinha doesn't need these
pills anymore.

150
00:11:18,175 --> 00:11:19,506
Why would I take these medicines?

151
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:23,671
Tell me.Why was I taking these pills?

152
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:26,147
Chatur Singh 2 star, sir. -Chatur Singh 2 star.

153
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,912
But Chatur Singh 2 star is missing since the past ten
days.

154
00:11:29,186 --> 00:11:31,518
And there is no news of his any stupid act.

155
00:11:31,622 --> 00:11:34,489
I think that stupid has realised his stupidity..

156
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:36,355
..and left for his village. -Right, sir.

157
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,758
You phone is ringing, answer it. -Yours is ringing, sir.

158
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:41,161
My phone is dead.

159
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:44,625
The landline, sir. -The landline is ringing.

160
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:49,806
Hello. -Inspector Yadav reporting, sir.

161
00:11:49,907 --> 00:11:51,670
Hi Yadav, tell me.What's the matter?

162
00:11:51,775 --> 00:11:53,208
How are everybody at home?

163
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,177
Parents, wife, children and girlfriend? -Sir, first class.

164
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,772
But I'm in bad shape, sir. -What happened to your
shape?

165
00:11:59,884 --> 00:12:01,715
Chatur Singh, sir.

166
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:03,308
Chatur Singh!

167
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:06,654
What did Chatur Singh do? -What not, sir? What
not?

168
00:12:06,757 --> 00:12:08,725
He has shaken the entire police station, sir.

169
00:12:08,826 --> 00:12:09,690
He has shaken the station?

170
00:12:09,793 --> 00:12:10,885
Hold on for a second, give me the pills.

171
00:12:11,161 --> 00:12:13,652
Which one, sir? -Laughter. -Hold it. Hold it!

172
00:12:19,203 --> 00:12:20,534
Tell me what he did.

173
00:12:20,638 --> 00:12:22,629
He went to the railway station posing as a
pickpocket.

174
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,607
Chatur Singh went to the railway station as a
pickpocket?

175
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:28,607
He didn't have any lD or uniform. -Neither ID nor
uniform.

176
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:32,740
He created panic by calling a box of flour as bomb.

177
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:36,879
He caused panic by calling a flour box as bomb.

178
00:12:37,154 --> 00:12:41,420
Added to it, he was sitting in my police station for 2
hours.

179
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:43,793
But he didn't tell his name.

180
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:45,792
Sir, I am losing my control.

181
00:12:45,896 --> 00:12:47,591
I'll go mad, sir.

182
00:12:47,698 --> 00:12:50,258
You will go mad, but I'm already mad.

183
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:54,538
I feel like small bombs of anger are bursting..

184
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:58,133
..in various parts of my body. -Sir, please control
your BP.

185
00:12:58,475 --> 00:12:59,874
I will shoot this Chatur Singh.

186
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,268
Shoot him, sir.

187
00:13:01,512 --> 00:13:03,810
I'll hang him. -Hang him, sir.

188
00:13:03,914 --> 00:13:06,883
I'll inject poison into him.

189
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:09,483
Inject poison into him, sir. Plunge it in!

190
00:13:09,587 --> 00:13:11,350
Take it easy, sir. Please. -Hold me.

191
00:13:11,455 --> 00:13:12,752
Hug me. -Sir!

192
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,287
Let go.What are you doing? Let go.

193
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:18,156
Let go! -Come along. -Let go!

194
00:13:18,262 --> 00:13:19,286
How did you change your disguise?

195
00:13:19,396 --> 00:13:23,730
I got a pickpocket. He was stealing someone's bag.

196
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:27,235
When I caught him, he said a fool gave it to him.

197
00:13:28,272 --> 00:13:29,864
Boss, who can be so foolish?

198
00:13:33,911 --> 00:13:34,900
Show me your face.

199
00:13:35,512 --> 00:13:37,503
You won't be happy to see my face.

200
00:13:37,615 --> 00:13:38,604
Turn around!

201
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:41,443
You!

202
00:13:41,952 --> 00:13:43,579
You know him, boss?

203
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:46,485
He looks like a pickpocket.

204
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:50,720
Do you know what problems that poor..

205
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:52,887
..man had to face because of you?

206
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:56,727
Boss, you know that fool too? -He's not a fool.

207
00:13:57,701 --> 00:14:00,204
I trusted him.

208
00:14:00,204 --> 00:14:03,367
You? -Not me, that man trusted him.

209
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:05,775
Shall I arrest him? -Yes. -Come along.

210
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:08,436
C'mon, I'll lock you up. -Just a moment.

211
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:10,438
Make him squat!

212
00:14:10,547 --> 00:14:11,844
Make him squat.

213
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:13,447
Squat?

214
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:17,483
This is a new torture technique.

215
00:14:19,556 --> 00:14:21,456
Sir, can I tell you something?

216
00:14:21,558 --> 00:14:24,550
No. You can tell me one thing.

217
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:26,219
Tell me.

218
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,763
Sir, this squatting is an old technique.

219
00:14:30,234 --> 00:14:32,259
Nowadays there is a latest idea in the market.

220
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:34,701
Is it? -Yes, that's what I want to tell you. Shall I?

221
00:14:35,305 --> 00:14:36,704
Go on. -Here's your chair.

222
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:39,503
You sit. Please sit.

223
00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:42,412
Feel that you're sitting in an airplane.

224
00:14:42,513 --> 00:14:44,708
Cross your legs. Yes.

225
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:48,709
Passengers, please wear your seat belts.

226
00:14:50,187 --> 00:14:51,848
Here's the airplane.

227
00:15:06,403 --> 00:15:09,861
Has it taken off? -No, boss. It has landed and he has
escaped.

228
00:15:10,374 --> 00:15:11,636
I'll go and nab him.

229
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:17,841
You shouldn't trust these people.

230
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:19,607
You're right, boss.

231
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:25,587
Wow! He's written so well.

232
00:15:27,191 --> 00:15:28,351
What has he written, boss?

233
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:33,155
Pappu, if only you'd been literate.

234
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,519
And read Col.

235
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:38,465
Shakki's novel, the flying lady and the sticking
snake.

236
00:15:39,803 --> 00:15:43,705
In this, Col. Shakki has discussed kidnapping.

237
00:15:43,807 --> 00:15:49,211
That kidnapping isn't done by one guy but an
entire gang.

238
00:15:49,413 --> 00:15:51,881
Oh boss!What a theory!

239
00:15:53,717 --> 00:15:54,809
Pappu, yes boss.

240
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,456
We'll solve all the kidnapping cases are per Col.

241
00:16:00,557 --> 00:16:02,582
Shakki's guidelines.

242
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:07,353
Yes, boss.What an idea! Col. Shakki.

243
00:16:08,098 --> 00:16:10,726
Who has been kidnapped? -My cat.

244
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:12,157
Your cat?

245
00:16:12,436 --> 00:16:16,133
Your cat's name? -I had a cat, a cat called Silky.

246
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,240
Why are you singing it? -I'm a musician.

247
00:16:18,342 --> 00:16:20,242
How dare you talk to me like this? Do you know
who I am?

248
00:16:20,344 --> 00:16:22,175
Who are you, punk? -Punk?! Old man!

249
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:25,476
I'm industrialist Nanda's only son, Kabir Nanda.

250
00:16:25,582 --> 00:16:28,142
You are Mr. Nanda's son.

251
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:32,511
Sir, we have a kidnapping case.

252
00:16:32,623 --> 00:16:35,217
Boss.. boss!

253
00:16:35,325 --> 00:16:38,158
Sir! We've a kidnapping case. -Where is it?

254
00:16:38,262 --> 00:16:39,251
There.There.

255
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:46,327
Notice how I solve this case in 3 minutes.

256
00:16:46,436 --> 00:16:48,233
Sir, he's an industrialist..

257
00:16:49,506 --> 00:16:51,770
Nobody talks till the boss solves the case.

258
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,536
Pin drop silence. Finger on your lips.

259
00:16:55,913 --> 00:16:57,676
He's the kidnapper.

260
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:03,309
What do you do? -l am a musician, I have a band.

261
00:17:08,892 --> 00:17:11,326
He calls his gang, a band.

262
00:17:12,663 --> 00:17:15,393
Who all are there in your gang?

263
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:20,826
In your band. -Me, Sandy and a sweet boy Mandy.

264
00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:28,770
He, Sandy and a sweet boy Mandy.

265
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,278
Who was kidnapped and from where?

266
00:17:33,884 --> 00:17:35,283
Silky from Carter Road.

267
00:17:37,487 --> 00:17:39,250
He kidnapped Silky..

268
00:17:39,423 --> 00:17:41,550
Where was Mandy?

269
00:17:41,892 --> 00:17:44,122
He was driving his red hot Ferrari.

270
00:17:45,729 --> 00:17:47,629
Mandy came there with his Ferrari.

271
00:17:48,432 --> 00:17:51,492
He and Mandy put Silky in the Ferrari..

272
00:17:51,602 --> 00:17:53,331
..and escaped.

273
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:57,305
And where was Sandy?

274
00:17:57,674 --> 00:17:59,835
He was in his godown. A place in Bhiwandi.

275
00:18:03,146 --> 00:18:05,842
Both of them put Silky in the car..

276
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,786
..and locked them up in Sandy's godown in
Bhiwandi.

277
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,717
Arrest him! -Yes, sir.

278
00:18:11,822 --> 00:18:13,619
No! No! Daddy! -C'mon!

279
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:16,591
Find both of them. Arrest him.

280
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:19,423
Daddy! Daddy! -C'mon, you can call your dad later.

281
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,159
I won't spare you!

282
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:23,460
Arrest him!

283
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:27,126
You solved the case in 3 minutes, boss.

284
00:18:27,471 --> 00:18:31,840
2 minutes and 40 seconds. You're great, sir!

285
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:34,569
Boss, your novel. The beheaded corpse.

286
00:18:37,247 --> 00:18:39,738
It's the minister's call.

287
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:40,680
Yes, minister.

288
00:18:40,784 --> 00:18:43,753
Police commissioner RK Sinha saying good morning
to you, sir.

289
00:18:43,854 --> 00:18:45,481
Sinha! -Sir,just a moment.

290
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:48,888
Before you say something, I'd like to say a little, sir.

291
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,558
If you're going to shower me with praise..

292
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:52,788
..then there's no need.

293
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:56,462
If you're going to take pride in me, it's not required
either.

294
00:18:56,566 --> 00:18:58,295
Because whatever the police commissioner..

295
00:18:58,402 --> 00:18:59,369
..has done was his duty.

296
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:02,802
But despite that, if you wish to praise me..

297
00:19:03,073 --> 00:19:06,167
..then please go ahead, sir. I'll put the phone on
speaker.

298
00:19:06,476 --> 00:19:09,604
Shut up, Sinha! I don't want to listen to your
nonsense.

299
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:14,446
I've not called you up to praise but to abuse you.

300
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:17,176
Why will you abuse me? What have I done?

301
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:18,845
Who is this Chatur Singh?

302
00:19:19,356 --> 00:19:20,345
Chatur Singh?

303
00:19:20,857 --> 00:19:22,415
What has Chatur Singh done, sir?

304
00:19:22,526 --> 00:19:26,257
That fool has arrested tycoon Nanda's son.

305
00:19:26,363 --> 00:19:28,388
Do you know how powerful Nanda is?

306
00:19:28,498 --> 00:19:30,762
Sir, allow me to kill Chatur Singh.

307
00:19:31,268 --> 00:19:32,496
I'll hang him.

308
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:35,662
And I'll plunge that lethal injection into him.

309
00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:37,603
Give me an injection.

310
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:47,341
Chatur Singh 2 star reporting, sir.

311
00:19:47,451 --> 00:19:50,750
If your foot lands on mine, I'll shoot you.

312
00:19:50,854 --> 00:19:53,516
I'll hang you and also inject poison into you.

313
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:57,618
Why have you worn a raincoat? Sir, it's not a
raincoat.

314
00:19:58,228 --> 00:19:59,252
It's a mission coat.

315
00:20:00,263 --> 00:20:02,322
You tell me the mission and don't waste time.

316
00:20:02,432 --> 00:20:04,866
What's the mission? -Mission, industrialist Nanda,
sir.

317
00:20:05,135 --> 00:20:08,866
How dare you to arrest Nanda's son?

318
00:20:10,474 --> 00:20:11,600
To say the truth, sir..

319
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:13,608
..I didn't have the courage first..

320
00:20:14,211 --> 00:20:17,374
..but with God's grace and your blessings..

321
00:20:17,714 --> 00:20:19,272
..the mission was accomplished.

322
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:22,647
That's fine but I am not praising you, I am
humiliating you,

323
00:20:22,853 --> 00:20:26,482
You should feel bad. -l should feel bad?

324
00:20:26,757 --> 00:20:28,224
Sir, were you humiliating me?

325
00:20:28,325 --> 00:20:30,384
In which language should I explain..

326
00:20:34,398 --> 00:20:36,798
It's 10.30, sir. -It's 1 0.30, sir.

327
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:40,862
I think somebody is eavesdropping. -Here?

328
00:20:41,638 --> 00:20:42,662
In this room.

329
00:21:01,224 --> 00:21:02,213
Stop him!

330
00:21:05,162 --> 00:21:06,186
No! No!

331
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,589
Stop him!

332
00:21:16,773 --> 00:21:19,571
I'll kill him! -It's ok. It's ok.

333
00:21:20,243 --> 00:21:23,406
Nobody is listening to us, sir. This area is secure.

334
00:21:23,513 --> 00:21:28,678
Chatur Singh 2 star, you're suspended for 1 5 days.

335
00:21:28,785 --> 00:21:30,150
Ok, sir.

336
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:38,587
Your turn, sir. Your turn.

337
00:21:48,472 --> 00:21:50,303
We're outside the agricultural minister..

338
00:21:50,407 --> 00:21:53,467
..YY Singh's, residence. -In the Rs. 500 crore
sugarcane scam..

339
00:21:53,577 --> 00:21:55,511
..the HC has rejected his bail plea.

340
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:58,339
This year's sugarcane produce is in the govt.
Godown.

341
00:21:58,648 --> 00:22:01,674
And nobody knows where the sugarcane juice has
been sold.

342
00:22:01,918 --> 00:22:04,546
The minister will be leaving for prison in a short
while.

343
00:22:04,821 --> 00:22:06,379
We're anxious about his condition.

344
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:17,763
Pack everything very carefully. Don't miss anything.

345
00:22:18,168 --> 00:22:21,467
I have packed everything. Your clothes, shoes..

346
00:22:22,205 --> 00:22:25,572
..your medicines and your ipod too.

347
00:22:26,243 --> 00:22:27,642
Why are you crying?

348
00:22:28,378 --> 00:22:29,743
I am just going to jail.

349
00:22:29,846 --> 00:22:32,440
Nowadays, all ministers have to go to prison.

350
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:34,642
But how long will you.. -No buts..

351
00:22:35,185 --> 00:22:37,380
Don't forget my lucky red handkerchief.

352
00:22:38,188 --> 00:22:42,818
I can live without you but can't live without red
color.

353
00:22:59,576 --> 00:23:01,567
Sonia, why hasn't the minister come out as yet?

354
00:23:01,678 --> 00:23:04,374
Why is the minister making the cops wait? Tell us.

355
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:05,470
No comments.

356
00:23:05,815 --> 00:23:09,410
Minister, the cops and the media are waiting for us.

357
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:10,577
We should leave.

358
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:12,718
You're my secretary.

359
00:23:12,822 --> 00:23:18,192
You know my wife very well. She's slow in
everything.

360
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,205

361
00:23:35,412 --> 00:23:37,573

Hello! City hospital!

364
00:24:08,578 --> 00:24:09,567
What is it?

365
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,613
Why are you staring? Haven't you ever seen roasted
chicken?

366
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,751
Sir, people outside think that your condition is very
serious.

367
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,855
What should I tell the media? -What difference does
it make?

368
00:24:20,123 --> 00:24:22,387
Tell them anything. Listen to me, brother.

..been admitted to City Hospital.

376
00:24:40,543 --> 00:24:42,875
He doesn't have to fear anybody in the country but..

377
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:45,238
..minister's like him can pose a threat to the country.

378
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:47,446
It's the misfortune of the police dept..

379
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,144
..that we have to provide security to such ministers.

380
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,449
I want you to be incharge of the minister's security.

381
00:24:54,557 --> 00:24:57,117
Sir, I am very proud to take this charge.

382
00:24:57,227 --> 00:24:59,821
Very good. -And equally sad about leaving it.

383
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:02,489
What? -Sir, my wife is going to deliver this week.

384
00:25:05,168 --> 00:25:07,363
You didn't tell me that your wife is going to have a
child.

385
00:25:07,804 --> 00:25:10,739
Even I came to know yesterday, sir. -Yesterday?

386
00:25:11,741 --> 00:25:15,108
Ok, Thakur, this is your responsibility.

387
00:25:15,211 --> 00:25:16,337
Yes, sir. -Good, sir.

388
00:25:16,446 --> 00:25:17,811
But no, sir. -Why, sir?

389
00:25:17,914 --> 00:25:19,404
I've a piles operation this week.

390
00:25:20,784 --> 00:25:22,411
You didn't tell me that you've piles.

391
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:24,214
Don't you believe it, sir? Would you like to see it?

392
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:25,879
No! Show it to Yadav.

393
00:25:26,156 --> 00:25:27,180

394
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,258
Ok, sir. -Ok. So..

395
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,095
What other excuses do you have?

396
00:25:33,196 --> 00:25:36,256
My sister's wedding, sir. -Sir, my sister has delivered
a baby.

397
00:25:36,366 --> 00:25:37,731
Sir, my sister's child is getting married.

398
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:41,497
There must be an officer for the security of the
minister.

399
00:25:41,838 --> 00:25:43,100
There's one, sir. -Who?

400
00:25:43,406 --> 00:25:46,842
Non-corrupt, non-intelligent and full of nonsense.

401
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,542
You've suspended him. -But who is it?

402
00:25:49,913 --> 00:25:51,505

''We going to do the Chatur Singh thing now.'

427
00:27:44,294 --> 00:27:46,626
''If you wish to search for your long lost brother.''

428
00:27:46,729 --> 00:27:49,220
''If you're worried that your husband is disloyal.''

429
00:27:49,332 --> 00:27:51,698
''Call him home, don't worry about money.''

430
00:27:51,801 --> 00:27:54,634
''Because he's a dear, innocent, big-hearted kinda

00:27:54,771 --> 00:27:56,796

''Singh.. Singh.. doing the same thing..'

00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,132
''He's the king with the zing thing.''

458
00:29:33,436 --> 00:29:35,563
''Not a puppet on a swing thing.'

459
00:29:51,487 --> 00:29:54,718
Why did you call me Sinha? -How dare you call me
Sinha?

460
00:29:54,824 --> 00:29:56,257
I didn't say anything, sir.

461
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:58,486
How dare you call me Sinha?

462
00:29:58,595 --> 00:30:02,258
You're forgetting that you suspended me for 1 5
days.

463
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:03,195
Today is just the 4th day.

464
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:08,498
I pity you that's why I called you back on duty.

465
00:30:08,771 --> 00:30:10,796
In that case, Chatur Singh reporting, sir.

466
00:30:10,907 --> 00:30:14,172
If your foot lands on mine then watch it!

00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,838
Chatur Singh, you've to go on an important job.

468
00:30:21,751 --> 00:30:24,549
Doctors, hawkers and engineers go on a job, sir.

469
00:30:24,654 --> 00:30:26,144
A spy goes on a mission.

470
00:30:26,255 --> 00:30:27,882
How could you say such a thing? -I mean..

471
00:30:28,157 --> 00:30:29,181
Shut up!

472
00:30:29,592 --> 00:30:30,650
I didn't meant that.

473
00:30:32,295 --> 00:30:34,820
The mission is that agricultural minister YY..

474
00:30:34,931 --> 00:30:37,491
..Singh has been admitted to the hospital.

475
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,834
His life isn't under threat.

476
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:45,501
Like a good guard, you've to sit outside his room on
a chair.

477
00:30:45,775 --> 00:30:47,470
That's all. You've to guard.

478
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,937
No need to act smart. Got it?

479
00:30:51,748 --> 00:30:53,773
This mission is fraught with dangers.

480
00:30:55,284 --> 00:31:00,688
But living on the edge is Chatur Singh's hobby and
profession.

481
00:31:01,924 --> 00:31:04,586
The job will be done. -Ok! Good.. good.

482
00:31:06,896 --> 00:31:09,797
It's 1 2.30, sir. -It's 1 2.30, sir.

483
00:31:11,434 --> 00:31:13,459
It seems somebody is eavesdropping on us.

484
00:31:13,569 --> 00:31:15,196
Nobody is eavesdropping.

485
00:31:15,304 --> 00:31:16,635
No need to tear down anything.

486
00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:18,798
No need to break anything. Get out, Chatur Singh.

487
00:31:18,908 --> 00:31:21,536
In that case, Chatur Singh is getting out, sir.

488
00:31:40,296 --> 00:31:41,888
Who's patient YY Singh here?

489
00:31:42,765 --> 00:31:47,327
Who is it? It's me. Can't you see?

490
00:31:47,904 --> 00:31:50,600
What you see, doesn't exist.

491
00:31:50,707 --> 00:31:52,868
And what exists, is invisible.

492
00:31:53,810 --> 00:32:00,477
Pappu. -Great detective, Chatur Singh 2 star at your
service.

493
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,548
Ok, fine. Sit outside.

494
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,345
I've to make enquiries first.

495
00:32:06,756 --> 00:32:09,691
Excuse me. Who are you?

496
00:32:10,593 --> 00:32:14,290
Well, I'm.. -Detective, she's my wife.

497
00:32:14,397 --> 00:32:18,424
In your hand. -This is orange juice.

498
00:32:22,271 --> 00:32:26,298
Pappu, send this to the forensic lab for testing.

499
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:27,501
Yes, boss.

500
00:32:39,756 --> 00:32:41,485
Somebody is hearing us.

501
00:32:44,293 --> 00:32:45,282
Hey!

502
00:33:04,814 --> 00:33:08,113
I told you, somebody is eavesdropping.

503
00:33:08,317 --> 00:33:10,217
Fools! He's my brother.

504
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,479
Godfather? Which gang?

505
00:33:11,921 --> 00:33:14,287
In my presence, you don't need to worry about any
don.

506
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,358
He is my brother!

507
00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:21,089
I know.

508
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,798
It's hot here.Where is the fan switch?

509
00:33:24,934 --> 00:33:27,368
So many switches are here.

510
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,605
Brother is in a fix!

511
00:33:33,709 --> 00:33:34,698
What's happening?

512
00:33:37,613 --> 00:33:39,877
What is he saying? -It seems he's talking in a code
language.

513
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:41,742
That's unique.

514
00:33:43,386 --> 00:33:44,876
He's asking us to turn off the switch.

515
00:33:50,893 --> 00:33:53,487
Get out! Get out!

516
00:33:53,863 --> 00:33:56,354
Sir, listen to me. -You listen to me.

517
00:33:56,632 --> 00:34:00,659
Get out from here! Get out or I'll shoot you!

518
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:04,103
Get out! -But your security.. -To hell with it..

519
00:34:04,207 --> 00:34:06,141
Get out. Get out from here.

520
00:34:06,242 --> 00:34:08,233
Even if you hear gun shots, don't come in.

521
00:34:08,344 --> 00:34:10,209
Even if I die, don't come in.

522
00:34:10,313 --> 00:34:12,281
You don't come in. Don't come in.

523
00:34:20,323 --> 00:34:23,417
Sister, why are you crying? Did somebody rob the
house?

524
00:34:24,527 --> 00:34:27,189
Treadmill, plasma, sofa, painting, everything's there.

525
00:34:27,296 --> 00:34:28,888
The dvd player is there too.

526
00:34:29,165 --> 00:34:33,226
Then? -Your brother-in-law.. -Brother-in-law?

527
00:34:34,136 --> 00:34:37,162
No, brother-in-law, you can't leave us.. -No! No!

528
00:34:37,273 --> 00:34:39,173
He didn't die. He's alive.

529
00:34:39,475 --> 00:34:41,500
He has been kidnapped.

530
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:46,212
He was coming back from the gym..

531
00:34:46,315 --> 00:34:49,182
..when two goons kidnapped him.

532
00:34:49,952 --> 00:34:52,512
Who is this? -Is it your brother-in-law?

533
00:34:53,556 --> 00:34:56,389
Hello. -Avery good morning to you, Sonia.

534
00:34:56,492 --> 00:34:58,653
Who are you? -Charlie.

535
00:34:59,695 --> 00:35:01,686
You're worried about your brother-in-law, isn't it?

536
00:35:01,797 --> 00:35:04,095
If something happens to my brother-in-law..

537
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,360
..then I won't spare you.

538
00:35:05,635 --> 00:35:09,594
Tony. -Sonia! Help me.

539
00:35:09,705 --> 00:35:13,368
They will kill me. They're dangerous people.

540
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,107
Brother-in-law, are you fine? -Hello, are you alive?

541
00:35:17,213 --> 00:35:19,340
Yes, but without protein shake.

542
00:35:19,482 --> 00:35:21,177
It's been 6 hours and they haven't..

543
00:35:21,284 --> 00:35:22,751
..even offered a glass of yoghurt.

544
00:35:23,853 --> 00:35:24,842
What?!

545
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:28,154
Look, you know me.

546
00:35:28,257 --> 00:35:30,487
Don't worry. I'll set everything right.

547
00:35:30,726 --> 00:35:34,127
Give the phone to Chaplin. -Chaplin, talk to her.

548
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,527
Yes, Chaplin. -Charlie.

549
00:35:35,898 --> 00:35:37,593
Whatever!What do you want?

550
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,294
YY Singh. -YY Singh?

551
00:35:41,404 --> 00:35:44,373
Yes, Sonia. Don't refuse please.

552
00:35:44,507 --> 00:35:47,135
Or we'll regret the death of your brother-in-law.

553
00:35:48,678 --> 00:35:51,738
Actually, we wish to play a game with YY Singh.

554
00:35:51,847 --> 00:35:53,872
And you've to help us in it.

555
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:57,711
Listen carefully, Sonia. City Hospital,VIP suite..

556
00:35:57,853 --> 00:35:59,684
..where YY Singh has been admitted.

557
00:36:00,222 --> 00:36:03,419
You just have to bring him to the balcony and that's
it.

558
00:36:03,526 --> 00:36:06,256
What nonsense is this? Why will he do it on my
behest?

559
00:36:06,362 --> 00:36:07,351
He will do so, Sonia.

560
00:36:07,463 --> 00:36:09,658
Have you ever checked yourself in the mirror?

561
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:12,494
You look so beautiful.

562
00:36:13,669 --> 00:36:17,070
And if you wear a red sari with this beautiful face..

563
00:36:17,173 --> 00:36:20,700
..then YY Singh will even jump from the balcony
willingly.

564
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,641
What if I refuse to do it?

565
00:36:22,745 --> 00:36:25,680
Tony. -Sonia, save me!

566
00:36:25,781 --> 00:36:29,444
Do what they say or else they'll kill me.

567
00:36:30,252 --> 00:36:32,117
Charlie, I accept all your terms..

568
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:33,882
..but no harm should befall him.

569
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,258
And yes, he should get protein shakes on time.

570
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:38,088
And vitamins.. -And vitamins too!

571
00:36:38,194 --> 00:36:40,094
That's like a good girl, Sonia.

572
00:36:40,429 --> 00:36:43,262
And yes Sonia, remember the red sari.

573
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,678
Excuse me. What's your name?

574
00:37:01,183 --> 00:37:03,651
Sonia. -Sonia?

575
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,544
Beautiful name.

576
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,317
What's your relationship with YY Singh?

577
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,252
I'm his secretary.Will you frisk me now?

578
00:37:18,401 --> 00:37:20,460
I do wish to but..

579
00:37:21,237 --> 00:37:23,171
..sadly, you can go.

580
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,308
Can I know your name?

581
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,403
Chatur Singh. -Chatur Singh!

582
00:37:30,913 --> 00:37:33,643
I hope you remember the name. -Of course.

583
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,284
Now, I'll go? -When will you return?

584
00:37:37,553 --> 00:37:39,885
If I'm unfortunate, then very soon.

585
00:37:40,322 --> 00:37:41,346
God willingly!

586
00:37:46,462 --> 00:37:48,896
Boss, why didn't you frisk that girl?

587
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:51,357
Does she look like a criminal?

588
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:53,731
How can you be so confident about that?

589
00:37:55,805 --> 00:37:57,432
I've seen it in her eyes.

590
00:37:58,941 --> 00:38:03,469
A girl with such innocent eyes can't be a criminal.

591
00:38:05,681 --> 00:38:10,175
You're so great, sir.. -Please, Pappu!

592
00:38:10,586 --> 00:38:12,053
Boss, your baton.

593
00:38:18,194 --> 00:38:19,183
Ouch!

594
00:38:20,362 --> 00:38:21,761
He's not even looking at me.

595
00:38:22,465 --> 00:38:24,626
What are you looking at, sir?

596
00:38:40,116 --> 00:38:41,344
Sir, you know me.

597
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:45,284
I can give you this cheque and file right here.

598
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:49,287
Then don't force me to sit next to you.

599
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:51,388
Sit down, Sonia.

600
00:38:53,496 --> 00:38:55,896
Sir, why are you staring at me?

601
00:38:56,899 --> 00:38:58,230
Am I not looking good?

602
00:38:58,334 --> 00:39:02,037
You're looking so good that I've to turn bad.

603
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:26,127
''A pearl bangle and pearl necklace..'

604
00:39:28,764 --> 00:39:32,564
''A pearl bangle and pearl necklace..'

605
00:39:32,668 --> 00:39:36,536
''My youth is a sprawling marketplace.'

606
00:39:40,309 --> 00:39:43,870
''A pearl bangle and pearl necklace..'

607
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,707
''A pearl bangle and pearl necklace..'

608
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,651
''Why do you ponder so much?''

609
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,484
Boss, control.

610
00:39:55,724 --> 00:39:59,091
''Why do you ponder so much?''

611
00:39:59,195 --> 00:40:02,892
''I'm a wild deer, hunt me down.'

612
00:40:45,174 --> 00:40:48,940
''There's fun, there's chance, wander into the
garden.'

613
00:40:52,548 --> 00:40:56,450
''Youth won't linger around long, dear boy.''

614
00:40:59,788 --> 00:41:03,724
''There's fun, there's chance, wander into the
garden.'

615
00:41:03,826 --> 00:41:07,626
''Youth won't linger around long, dear boy.''

616
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:11,666
''My youth is so enchanting..''

617
00:41:11,867 --> 00:41:15,200
''..the one who touches it, is jolted awake.'

618
00:41:15,304 --> 00:41:19,536
''Leave your mark on my fair body.'

619
00:41:19,842 --> 00:41:21,810
What are you doing, boss? I hope nobody's
watching.

620
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:22,899
Something's fishy!

621
00:41:23,412 --> 00:41:26,745
''Don't leave anything on tap, O dear..'

622
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:30,546
''Don't leave anything on tap, O dear.''

623
00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:34,320
''Why do you ponder so much?''

624
00:41:34,423 --> 00:41:38,189
''I'm a wild deer, hunt me down.'

625
00:41:49,872 --> 00:41:53,774
''What will you give me to lose yourself?''

626
00:41:57,379 --> 00:42:01,179
''In a moment, I'll take you around the world.'

627
00:42:05,187 --> 00:42:08,350
''What will you give me to lose yourself?''

628
00:42:08,657 --> 00:42:12,457
''In a moment, I'll take you around the world.'

629
00:42:12,761 --> 00:42:16,527
''Shall I shake my slender hips?'

630
00:42:16,765 --> 00:42:20,166
''Bring you down on your knees.'

631
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:24,328
''Make me your beloved.''

632
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:31,576
''Or else you spend the night alone.''

633
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,673
''Or else you spend the night alone.''

634
00:42:35,784 --> 00:42:42,815
''Why do you.. why do you.. why do you ponder so
much?'

635
00:42:42,925 --> 00:42:46,827
''I'm a wild deer, hunt me down.'

636
00:43:05,347 --> 00:43:08,180
I can hear firing inside. -Don't worry, Pappu.

637
00:43:08,517 --> 00:43:10,610
They must be watching action movie. Ram Babu.

638
00:43:11,453 --> 00:43:12,715
It's not Ram Babu, it's Rambo.

639
00:43:13,389 --> 00:43:14,447
I know.. I know that.

640
00:43:22,264 --> 00:43:25,529
In connection with agricultural minister YY Singh's
murder..

641
00:43:25,634 --> 00:43:29,764
..his personal secretary Sonia Verma was arrested
today.

642
00:43:30,406 --> 00:43:32,601
Sonia was present on the scene of crime.

643
00:43:32,941 --> 00:43:35,876
But the reason for the murder isn't clear yet.

644
00:43:36,345 --> 00:43:39,906
YY Singh's murderer Sonia is in Chatur Singh's
custody.

645
00:43:41,216 --> 00:43:42,444
This case is very sensitive.

646
00:43:42,885 --> 00:43:45,217
I am afraid that Chatur singh shouldn't make any
mistake.

647
00:43:45,687 --> 00:43:48,485
But.. where is Chatur Singh?

648
00:43:48,824 --> 00:43:50,382
Chatur Singh 2 star reporting, sir!

649
00:43:50,492 --> 00:43:53,427
If your foot landed on mine..

650
00:43:55,497 --> 00:43:58,466
I want to discuss an important issue with you.

651
00:43:59,334 --> 00:44:01,302
I also want to discuss an important issue with you.

652
00:44:02,871 --> 00:44:04,600
I was thinking about something.

653
00:44:05,574 --> 00:44:07,405
I was also thinking about something.

654
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:11,270
I was thinking about someone.

655
00:44:11,914 --> 00:44:13,882
I was also thinking about someone.

656
00:44:14,149 --> 00:44:16,583
But I was thinking about Sonia.

657
00:44:16,819 --> 00:44:20,448
At this age you are thinking about Sonia?

658
00:44:20,556 --> 00:44:22,854
I was not thinking from that angle..

659
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:25,525
..Sonia's hearing is after 3 days..

660
00:44:25,627 --> 00:44:27,652
..and it's your responsibility to present her in court.

661
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:30,831
Sir, Sonia is innocent. -She's not a murderer.

662
00:44:30,933 --> 00:44:34,391
Whether she's guilty or not is the court's decision.

663
00:44:34,503 --> 00:44:36,562
But it's your responsibility to present..

664
00:44:36,672 --> 00:44:38,503
..her in court without any problems.

665
00:44:38,941 --> 00:44:41,569
I will fulfill this responsibilty all my life, sir.

666
00:44:41,677 --> 00:44:43,144
Oh shut up and get out!

667
00:44:43,245 --> 00:44:45,338
Chatur Singh getting out, sir.

668
00:44:51,954 --> 00:44:53,182
Hold him.

669
00:44:55,524 --> 00:44:57,321
Sir, this file.. -Constable!

670
00:44:57,826 --> 00:44:59,316
Tell me who you want to meet?

671
00:44:59,428 --> 00:45:00,861
I want to meet Sonia, I'm her lawyer.

672
00:45:02,331 --> 00:45:03,389
There. -Thank you.

673
00:45:08,637 --> 00:45:09,661
How are you, Sonia?

674
00:45:10,439 --> 00:45:11,463
Who are you?

675
00:45:12,608 --> 00:45:15,168
My name is Tony and I am not a lawyer.

676
00:45:15,577 --> 00:45:16,635
Charlie sent me here.

677
00:45:18,413 --> 00:45:20,244
What have you got me into?

678
00:45:20,782 --> 00:45:23,751
Had I known that you were going to kill YY Singh..

679
00:45:24,486 --> 00:45:27,216
..then I'd have never agreed to do this. -Relax, Sonia.

680
00:45:27,689 --> 00:45:30,214
Charlie's happy with your job. -Shut up!

681
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,658
I did whatever you wanted me to do.

682
00:45:34,229 --> 00:45:36,424
Where's my brother-in-law? -The job isn't over yet.

683
00:45:36,832 --> 00:45:38,857
Charlie wants you to go to South Africa.

684
00:45:39,134 --> 00:45:40,123
South Africa?

685
00:45:40,435 --> 00:45:42,494
You guys have gone mad. -Let me finish.

686
00:45:44,573 --> 00:45:46,564
We are not sending you there for a vacation.

687
00:45:47,643 --> 00:45:52,580
Actually, YY Singh has kept the 500 crores from the
scam with a South African don..

688
00:45:52,681 --> 00:45:53,670
..Guru Gulfam.

689
00:45:54,516 --> 00:45:56,245
They were partners in crime, you know.

690
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,216
We want you to get those diamonds for us.

691
00:45:59,555 --> 00:46:00,681
Why would I do that?

692
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:04,718
Because it's better to go to South Africa..

693
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,624
..and start a new life than rot in an Indian jail.

694
00:46:08,397 --> 00:46:11,730
But who would take me out of here? -Chatur Singh!

695
00:46:12,267 --> 00:46:13,632
He will take you out from here.

696
00:46:14,303 --> 00:46:15,736
And I will take you to South Africa.

697
00:46:16,538 --> 00:46:18,130
Just wait for the right time.

698
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,829
Good luck, Sonia.

699
00:46:32,387 --> 00:46:34,821
Boss!We've to torture Sonia today..

700
00:46:34,923 --> 00:46:37,357
..and you've tears in your eyes?

701
00:46:37,693 --> 00:46:39,558
It should be fiery, boss. Fiery!

702
00:46:40,462 --> 00:46:45,456
How will I torture that innocent girl?

703
00:46:45,567 --> 00:46:48,900
You have to, boss. You have to.

704
00:46:49,204 --> 00:46:50,671
And you've to do your duty.

705
00:46:50,772 --> 00:46:52,831
It was done carefully.

706
00:46:52,941 --> 00:46:54,169
Sonia's coming, boss.

707
00:47:00,215 --> 00:47:01,580
What will I call her?

708
00:47:02,618 --> 00:47:05,280
Sonia. Ms. Sonia.

709
00:47:06,521 --> 00:47:07,579
Or Sonu?

710
00:47:08,256 --> 00:47:10,224
How do you know my childhood name?

711
00:47:16,365 --> 00:47:19,198
It's the duty of a famous detective.

712
00:47:19,301 --> 00:47:22,327
And it's also the job of a famous detective to hang
me.

713
00:47:22,704 --> 00:47:24,865
Pick up your baton and break my limbs.

714
00:47:25,273 --> 00:47:26,365
Beat me up.

715
00:47:27,876 --> 00:47:29,468
Chatur Singh.

716
00:47:30,912 --> 00:47:33,210
Just look into my eyes once.

717
00:47:35,717 --> 00:47:37,378
Do I appear guilty?

718
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:39,744
Don't show me your eyes, please.

719
00:47:39,855 --> 00:47:42,449
Chatur Singh, please, I'm innocent.

720
00:47:48,664 --> 00:47:49,756
Go away from here.

721
00:47:50,232 --> 00:47:51,221
Or else..

722
00:47:51,533 --> 00:47:54,627
Or else you'll beat me up, kill me?

723
00:47:54,836 --> 00:47:57,327
How can you even think that I'll beat you up?

724
00:47:57,706 --> 00:48:00,766
Please take her away from here. -l will go by myself.

725
00:48:03,779 --> 00:48:06,543
It was only you whom I had faith on.

726
00:48:07,149 --> 00:48:09,083
And you turned out to be like the rest of them.

727
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:16,780
If possible..

728
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:20,394
..please forgive me.

729
00:48:22,464 --> 00:48:23,453
Sonia.

730
00:48:26,902 --> 00:48:29,132
What's the job? -Help Sonia escape from prison.

731
00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:33,303
Go on. Have you gone mad?

732
00:48:34,242 --> 00:48:36,210
She has been accused of YY Singh's murder.

733
00:48:36,611 --> 00:48:40,172
I will lose my job. -If you lose your job then come to
us, Yadav.

734
00:48:40,615 --> 00:48:42,242
You won't lose your job because..

735
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:43,817
..you don't have to do this job..

736
00:48:44,886 --> 00:48:46,444
You've to get it done.

737
00:48:46,588 --> 00:48:49,614
By whom? -Chatur Singh.

738
00:48:52,294 --> 00:48:53,886
This area is secure.

739
00:48:55,697 --> 00:48:56,755
No problem.

740
00:48:59,534 --> 00:49:00,626
Listen.

741
00:49:02,504 --> 00:49:04,199
Not there, listen here.

742
00:49:07,476 --> 00:49:11,207
I've brought an important information. -What?

743
00:49:11,546 --> 00:49:15,505
That girl Sonia isn't YY Singh's murderer.

744
00:49:15,751 --> 00:49:16,775
What are you saying?

745
00:49:17,285 --> 00:49:19,776
I also had a doubt that she can't be a killer.

746
00:49:20,689 --> 00:49:24,318
Have you read the new novel of the famous thriller
novelist?

747
00:49:25,827 --> 00:49:27,488
No, I haven't.When was it published?

748
00:49:27,596 --> 00:49:31,123
Just two days back. Col. Shakki has clearly written..

749
00:49:31,433 --> 00:49:33,230
..that what is visible, doesn't exist..

750
00:49:33,368 --> 00:49:34,836
..and what exists, isn't apparent.

751
00:49:34,836 --> 00:49:35,427
..and what exists, isn't apparent.

752
00:49:35,837 --> 00:49:38,203
Col. Shakki, you're great!

753
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:40,804
There's only one way to nab the real killer..

754
00:49:40,909 --> 00:49:43,503
..make the accused escape from prison.

755
00:49:43,612 --> 00:49:44,874
And then follow her.

756
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,410
Yes. Because he's not going to party..

757
00:49:47,516 --> 00:49:49,313
..after escaping from prison.

758
00:49:49,417 --> 00:49:49,985
But go directly to the real murderer.

759
00:49:49,985 --> 00:49:52,283
But go directly to the real murderer.

760
00:49:52,654 --> 00:49:55,817
Am I wrong? -Col. Shakki can never be wrong.

761
00:49:55,924 --> 00:49:58,791
But don't tell this secret to Chatur Singh. -Why?

762
00:49:58,894 --> 00:50:01,089
Otherwise he will show some miracle..

763
00:50:01,196 --> 00:50:02,891
..and become 3 star from 2 stars.

764
00:50:03,165 --> 00:50:04,189
Is it? -Yes.

765
00:50:04,633 --> 00:50:05,000
C'mon, let's go home.

766
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,592
C'mon, let's go home.

767
00:50:17,245 --> 00:50:19,981
I can hear any whisper.

768
00:50:19,981 --> 00:50:20,208
I can hear any whisper.

769
00:50:21,316 --> 00:50:23,648
Now nobody can't stop me from becoming 3 star.

770
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:27,482
Sir, we'll die.We'll lose our job, sir.

771
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:30,786
Sir, I have a family. Show some mercy.

772
00:50:31,226 --> 00:50:34,354
Sir, I have two wives and 1 daughter.

773
00:50:34,462 --> 00:50:34,696
I feel ashamed that I'm working in your dept.

774
00:50:34,696 --> 00:50:38,359
I feel ashamed that I'm working in your dept.

775
00:50:38,466 --> 00:50:39,933
We too! -Shut up!

776
00:50:41,203 --> 00:50:44,832
Boss wants to say that you all have to help Sonia
escape.

777
00:50:46,575 --> 00:50:48,839
Pappu, explain the plan to them.

778
00:50:49,444 --> 00:50:49,644
Yes, boss.

779
00:50:49,644 --> 00:50:50,440
Yes, boss.

780
00:50:53,515 --> 00:50:58,475
This is the world map. And this region is called
India.

781
00:51:00,922 --> 00:51:03,447
Boss, I can't find the place in the world map.

782
00:51:04,693 --> 00:51:04,726
Pappu, this mission is between Santa Cruz and
Andheri.

783
00:51:04,726 --> 00:51:09,629
Pappu, this mission is between Santa Cruz and
Andheri.

784
00:51:10,165 --> 00:51:11,689
Where did the world map come from?

785
00:51:12,534 --> 00:51:15,264
No problem. Listen.

786
00:51:15,737 --> 00:51:19,798
My mission is that you all will help Sonia escape.

787
00:51:19,908 --> 00:51:20,897
No, sir.

788
00:51:21,209 --> 00:51:22,870
And I will follow her.

789
00:51:23,144 --> 00:51:27,171
No, sir. I'll follow her to the real murderer.

790
00:51:27,282 --> 00:51:31,309
No! -I'll box him.

791
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:34,420
Do karate with him. Blind him.

792
00:51:34,522 --> 00:51:34,823
Grab him by his neck, lock him up and prove Sonia
innocent.

793
00:51:34,823 --> 00:51:39,920
Grab him by his neck, lock him up and prove Sonia
innocent.

794
00:51:40,462 --> 00:51:42,692
Who made this plan, sir?

795
00:51:43,265 --> 00:51:45,563
The one and only Chatur Singh 2 star.

796
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:46,656
No!

797
00:51:48,737 --> 00:51:49,671
And listen further..

798
00:51:55,677 --> 00:51:57,167
Where's everybody?

799
00:51:59,848 --> 00:52:02,112
Boss, after hearing your plan..

800
00:52:02,217 --> 00:52:04,452
..they've all fallen at your feet.

801
00:52:09,157 --> 00:52:13,423
Prepare to make Sonia escape.

802
00:52:14,262 --> 00:52:16,162
Madam, this is your food.

803
00:52:16,464 --> 00:52:18,261
Here, have it.

804
00:52:18,767 --> 00:52:19,668
And listen, get a betel leaf.

805
00:52:19,668 --> 00:52:21,295
And listen, get a betel leaf.

806
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:30,100
Hello! Hello! I can't hear you! -It seems the signal's
weak.

807
00:52:30,211 --> 00:52:32,202
I'll come out and talk to you.

808
00:52:32,314 --> 00:52:34,646
You have your meal. I can't hear you!

809
00:52:40,755 --> 00:52:42,518
She's coming, sleep off Sakharam.

810
00:52:57,872 --> 00:52:59,499
She's coming, don't look there.

811
00:53:01,676 --> 00:53:04,270
Let's go away from here.

812
00:53:16,691 --> 00:53:19,361
Boss! Boss! Something's missing.

813
00:53:19,361 --> 00:53:19,725
Boss! Boss! Something's missing.

814
00:53:20,328 --> 00:53:22,455
What? -What did Col. Shakki say?

815
00:53:22,897 --> 00:53:26,333
To make the girl escape. -And then follow her.

816
00:53:26,634 --> 00:53:28,625
Oh! I forgot.

817
00:53:29,537 --> 00:53:32,131
What?!What are you saying?!

818
00:53:32,774 --> 00:53:33,763
Ok.

819
00:53:35,243 --> 00:53:36,870
I received a call from immigration.

820
00:53:37,145 --> 00:53:39,739
Sonia escaped to South Africa by the afternoon
flight.

821
00:53:40,915 --> 00:53:43,349
Sir, I know it's my mistake.

822
00:53:43,651 --> 00:53:46,711
Mistake? It's not a mistake, Chatur Singh. It's a
crime.

823
00:53:47,222 --> 00:53:49,557
Until now, I thought you're a foolish man.

824
00:53:50,692 --> 00:53:52,250
But you're a menace to the country.

825
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,528
You know that an accomplice to a criminal..

826
00:53:54,629 --> 00:53:55,926
..is also a criminal under law.

827
00:53:56,231 --> 00:53:59,257
Sir, give me one more chance.

828
00:53:59,367 --> 00:54:01,699
Chance? Me?

829
00:54:02,437 --> 00:54:04,439
Look, the law can give you any punishment.

830
00:54:04,439 --> 00:54:05,064
Look, the law can give you any punishment.

831
00:54:05,273 --> 00:54:08,242
But had I been the judge, I'd have had you hanged.

832
00:54:09,911 --> 00:54:12,277
You were very proud of your 2 stars.

833
00:54:14,482 --> 00:54:16,780
Henceforth, you're not Chatur Singh 2 star..

834
00:54:17,385 --> 00:54:19,387
..but Chatur Singh 'No-star'.

835
00:54:43,244 --> 00:54:44,802
Just give me one chance, sir.

836
00:54:44,913 --> 00:54:46,608
Give me once chance!

837
00:54:46,714 --> 00:54:49,417
Don't spoil my mood by crying like this, Chatur
Singh.

838
00:54:49,417 --> 00:54:49,883
Don't spoil my mood by crying like this, Chatur
Singh.

839
00:54:50,218 --> 00:54:53,745
You've a court hearing today. -And I'm very happy
about that.

840
00:54:54,155 --> 00:54:55,247
Sir, please understand.

841
00:54:55,356 --> 00:54:56,618
Understand what, Chatur Singh?

842
00:54:56,724 --> 00:54:57,816
What's going on here?

843
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,355
I am sorry to hear about Minister's death.

844
00:55:02,564 --> 00:55:04,466
But congratulations to take over his seat.

845
00:55:04,466 --> 00:55:05,592
But congratulations to take over his seat.

846
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,395
Tell me what can I do for you?

847
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:10,064
Did you find out something about my husband's
killer?

848
00:55:10,171 --> 00:55:13,106
Not yet, but I have got this case in my hands.

849
00:55:13,208 --> 00:55:15,438
Now we will find out. -Madam, I want to talk to you.

850
00:55:15,543 --> 00:55:17,875
But madam doesn't want to talk to you, Chatur
Singh.

851
00:55:18,146 --> 00:55:19,481
Take him away, Kulkarni. -Sir!

852
00:55:19,481 --> 00:55:20,448
Take him away, Kulkarni. -Sir!

853
00:55:20,548 --> 00:55:21,640
Let him speak.

854
00:55:22,484 --> 00:55:23,849
What do you want to say?

855
00:55:24,385 --> 00:55:27,354
Ma'am, I know it's all happened because of me.

856
00:55:27,722 --> 00:55:29,314
But give me one chance..

857
00:55:29,624 --> 00:55:31,285
..it's notjust a case for me..

858
00:55:31,392 --> 00:55:33,087
..it's a matter of my 2 stars and my uniform's
respect.

859
00:55:33,194 --> 00:55:34,429
But madam doesn't want to give you any chance.

860
00:55:34,429 --> 00:55:35,259
But madam doesn't want to give you any chance.

861
00:55:35,363 --> 00:55:37,331
My heart says that he is a true guy.

862
00:55:37,432 --> 00:55:39,127
But madam.. -Just a moment.

863
00:55:39,868 --> 00:55:41,597
I've made my decision.

864
00:55:42,203 --> 00:55:43,670
I'll talk to the Chief Minister.

865
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:46,307
And I will take special permission for Chatur Singh.

866
00:55:47,575 --> 00:55:49,477
Please arrange for his visit to South Africa.

867
00:55:49,477 --> 00:55:50,307
Please arrange for his visit to South Africa.

868
00:55:55,383 --> 00:55:58,477
South Africa, Chatur Singh's coming.

869
00:56:15,703 --> 00:56:17,261
Good morning, Mr. Chatur Singh.

870
00:56:31,786 --> 00:56:33,879
Welcome to South Africa, Mr. Chatur Singh.

871
00:56:34,656 --> 00:56:35,645
Enjoy your stay.

872
00:56:41,429 --> 00:56:42,418
Taxi!

873
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,198
Who are you? -I'm a cabbie, sir.

874
00:56:48,303 --> 00:56:49,170
I'll drop you wherever you want me to.

875
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:50,535
I'll drop you wherever you want me to.

876
00:56:50,705 --> 00:56:52,172
C'mon, let's go in your taxi.

877
00:56:52,273 --> 00:56:54,264
The taxi isn't there, it is here, sir.

878
00:56:54,809 --> 00:56:56,333
This is the taxi? -Yes.

879
00:56:56,678 --> 00:56:58,873
See, these are the keys, the lights..

880
00:56:59,147 --> 00:57:02,139
..the caruburretor, the horn..

881
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:04,185
..there's a boot at the back and this is the seat.

882
00:57:04,485 --> 00:57:07,511
Sit on the seat, I'll drop you wherever you want me
to.

883
00:57:07,855 --> 00:57:10,153
I got it. You're mad.

884
00:57:10,258 --> 00:57:12,089
Everybody says so, but I don't believe it.

885
00:57:12,427 --> 00:57:13,416
Move, let me go.

886
00:57:13,528 --> 00:57:16,656
But I don't understand, why aren't you sitting in my
taxi?

887
00:57:17,365 --> 00:57:19,167
I've been driving since I was two.

888
00:57:19,167 --> 00:57:19,565
I've been driving since I was two.

889
00:57:19,667 --> 00:57:22,761
I'm 5 years old now, everybody in Pahargunj knows
me.

890
00:57:24,472 --> 00:57:29,068
Pahargunj? This isn't Pahargunj, but Cape Town.

891
00:57:29,177 --> 00:57:32,237
This is Pahargunj. See there, a pahar (mountain).

892
00:57:33,514 --> 00:57:34,215
See there, gunj (bald).

893
00:57:34,215 --> 00:57:34,806
See there, gunj (bald).

894
00:57:36,417 --> 00:57:38,408
Pahargunj. -You're right.

895
00:57:38,686 --> 00:57:39,710
Yes. -No.

896
00:57:39,821 --> 00:57:41,220
Chatur Singh!

897
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:45,883
Tell me.Whose man are you, Babban?

898
00:57:46,194 --> 00:57:47,593
I'm my wife's man.

899
00:57:47,695 --> 00:57:49,430
And my name isn't Babban, it's Lallan aka Lally.

900
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:50,124
And my name isn't Babban, it's Lallan aka Lally.

901
00:57:50,465 --> 00:57:53,400
My name is Chatur Singh. But how do you know?

902
00:57:53,635 --> 00:57:57,127
You've written it on your box.

903
00:57:57,505 --> 00:58:00,167
It's written Chatur Singh.

904
00:58:00,275 --> 00:58:01,742
That's why I read it.

905
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:04,379
Where are you headed? -I won't tell you.

906
00:58:04,379 --> 00:58:05,209
Where are you headed? -I won't tell you.

907
00:58:05,546 --> 00:58:07,639
Then sit here. Your visa will expire..

908
00:58:07,749 --> 00:58:09,740
..and then you can go to Rampur for your
honeymoon.

909
00:58:10,652 --> 00:58:12,552
In that case, I've to..

910
00:58:15,757 --> 00:58:18,487
..Table.. -There's a table.

911
00:58:18,793 --> 00:58:19,327
But I'll only drink coffee there. I'll stay elsewhere.

912
00:58:19,327 --> 00:58:21,761
But I'll only drink coffee there. I'll stay elsewhere.

913
00:58:22,196 --> 00:58:23,788
And you'll have to tell me.

914
00:58:23,898 --> 00:58:26,765
I'll reach you to Table and wherever you wish to go..

915
00:58:26,868 --> 00:58:27,857
..I'll drop you.

916
00:58:28,369 --> 00:58:31,634
I didn't tell him. Should I thrash you?

917
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:34,275
Taxis crash, they don't die.

918
00:58:34,275 --> 00:58:34,707
Taxis crash, they don't die.

919
00:58:35,677 --> 00:58:38,145
Everything will be fine. Go home.

920
00:59:01,469 --> 00:59:04,063
It seems he's mad. -Seems?

921
00:59:43,878 --> 00:59:45,345
May I help you, sir?

922
00:59:46,881 --> 00:59:49,283
One room please. -Are you Indian?

923
00:59:51,352 --> 00:59:54,321
Yes, of course. -Then talk in Hindi, I am also lndian.

924
00:59:57,759 --> 00:59:58,748
Sonia Verma.

925
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:03,822
Hi, room 735 please.

926
01:00:13,441 --> 01:00:15,306
Nice statue. -Thank you.

927
01:00:19,914 --> 01:00:22,382
Surprising. She didn't recognise me.

928
01:00:24,619 --> 01:00:28,214
Sonia Verma. 735.

929
01:00:28,723 --> 01:00:31,351
Chatur Singh, 736.

930
01:00:45,907 --> 01:00:47,807
Hey! Pappu, you? -Yes, me.

931
01:00:48,376 --> 01:00:49,043
How did you come here? -Student is where the
master is.

932
01:00:49,043 --> 01:00:51,705
How did you come here? -Student is where the
master is.

933
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,573
I was in your flight. -My flight?

934
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:58,385
I didn't see you. -l was in business class.

935
01:00:58,686 --> 01:01:01,177
And you? -I..

936
01:01:04,192 --> 01:01:05,557
I was flying the plane.

937
01:01:09,664 --> 01:01:11,723
You were flying plane?

938
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:14,631
You were flying it so well, boss.

939
01:01:24,545 --> 01:01:28,413
Boss, the first foreign trip of my life. For the first
time..

940
01:01:28,816 --> 01:01:31,478
..I was flying and you were the driver of that plane!

941
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:33,955
Not a drive, idiot. Pilot!

942
01:01:33,955 --> 01:01:34,853
Not a drive, idiot. Pilot!

943
01:01:35,289 --> 01:01:36,313
Pilot!

944
01:01:37,859 --> 01:01:40,384
You're great.. -Pappu!

945
01:01:40,495 --> 01:01:44,625
No, what are you doing? Be happy!

946
01:01:45,166 --> 01:01:47,566
Boss, your passport. They won't let you go without
it.

947
01:01:48,636 --> 01:01:49,537
I know that. I know that.

948
01:01:49,537 --> 01:01:49,764
I know that. I know that.

949
01:01:50,771 --> 01:01:52,864
What's this? You've been drinking since you came
here.

950
01:01:53,307 --> 01:01:54,569
C'mon, we've to leave.

951
01:01:54,909 --> 01:01:57,571
Chatur Singh is staying in our hotel. -Relax, Sonia.

952
01:01:58,312 --> 01:01:59,870
How can that fool pose a threat to us?

953
01:02:00,715 --> 01:02:02,148
He's crazy about you anyway.

954
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:03,885
Hey!What are you trying to say?

955
01:02:03,885 --> 01:02:04,112
Hey!What are you trying to say?

956
01:02:04,685 --> 01:02:07,176
Instead of running away from him, embrace him.

957
01:02:08,189 --> 01:02:11,681
Chatur Singh will help us reach Guru Gulfam and his
gang.

958
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,691
But why will he do that?

959
01:02:15,863 --> 01:02:18,833
Because that fool believes that you're innocent.

960
01:02:18,933 --> 01:02:21,163
It's true. I was trapped.

961
01:02:21,536 --> 01:02:23,663
Because of you, I had to escape from India.

962
01:02:25,473 --> 01:02:27,600
Yes, Sonia but don't forget that you're..

963
01:02:27,708 --> 01:02:29,642
..doing this for your brother-in-law.

964
01:02:31,279 --> 01:02:34,081
I don't know what else I'll be compelled to do.

965
01:02:35,516 --> 01:02:38,849
By using an innocent person..

966
01:02:39,453 --> 01:02:40,886
..I'm ashamed of myself.

967
01:02:43,491 --> 01:02:46,517
Boss, where are you going? -I'm going shopping.

968
01:02:46,627 --> 01:02:50,393
Shopping? Have you come here to solve the case or
shop?

969
01:02:51,265 --> 01:02:55,361
I'm not going to shop for myself, but for the
country.

970
01:02:56,203 --> 01:02:59,536
New mission, new disguise. Another thing..

971
01:03:00,808 --> 01:03:02,605
..we'll have a code between us.

972
01:03:03,377 --> 01:03:07,780
I'll knock the door thrice and say, 'Hip hip hurray!'.

973
01:03:08,282 --> 01:03:12,184
And on hearing that you'll knock the door twice
and say..

974
01:03:12,286 --> 01:03:13,514
..'Hurray, hip hip'.

975
01:03:13,888 --> 01:03:16,220
And then open the door. Get it?

976
01:03:16,324 --> 01:03:17,313
Yes, boss.

977
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:34,407
Boss, why did you hit me?

978
01:03:34,709 --> 01:03:36,108
Why did you open the door?

979
01:03:36,344 --> 01:03:38,175
Who else can it be in 3 seconds?

980
01:03:38,279 --> 01:03:40,679
Many a great incidents can occur in 3 seconds.

981
01:03:42,783 --> 01:03:46,275
Boss, such mistakes will never be repeated. -Good.

982
01:03:56,864 --> 01:03:58,422
There is nothing to be affair off!

983
01:03:58,933 --> 01:04:00,423
This area is really safe!

984
01:04:01,369 --> 01:04:03,530
Shop! Shop!! -Cloths shop!

985
01:04:03,671 --> 01:04:05,161

990
01:04:15,116 --> 01:04:16,481

998
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:37,569
I think you are mad!- Hey brother!

999
01:04:37,672 --> 01:04:41,130
A lot of people say that! But it's my heart that never
agrees!

1000
01:04:42,309 --> 01:04:44,834
Non sense. -But brother, what's wrong with my
shop?

1001
01:04:44,945 --> 01:04:45,843
I had opened this shop last birth..

1002
01:04:45,946 --> 01:04:46,913
and this life I am looking after it!

1003
01:04:47,181 --> 01:04:50,514
If you don't believe it, then ask anyone at
Chandnichowk!

1004
01:04:51,218 --> 01:04:53,550
This is not Chandnichowk..this is Cap town.

1005
01:04:53,654 --> 01:04:54,916
No this is Chandnichowk!

1006
01:04:55,389 --> 01:04:57,323
Look that's side Chandini!

And now look at this, it's a chalk..so that's
Chandnichowk!

1008
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:03,490
He is right! -Yes!

1009
01:05:03,898 --> 01:05:06,093
No! Now let me go!

1010
01:05:08,769 --> 01:05:10,430
Brother! I think you are stealing..

1011
01:05:10,538 --> 01:05:12,130

1012
01:05:13,574 --> 01:05:15,474

Four and one..do you completely understand.. -Yes

''Chatur Singh is coming!'

1032
01:06:33,154 --> 01:06:34,712
''He is coming!'

1033
01:06:35,322 --> 01:06:38,621
''Star Singh is coming!''

1034
01:06:38,859 --> 01:06:40,827
Tony..Chatur Singh is here.

1035
01:06:41,395 --> 01:06:44,228
He looks like a cartoon, He wants to follow you up.

1036
01:06:44,331 --> 01:06:45,355
Let him go ahead!

1037

1047
01:07:54,935 --> 01:07:57,529
Why don't you sit, After all it's your table.

1048
01:07:58,272 --> 01:08:00,433
So what's your name? I think I have to create a new
name.

1049
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:02,805
What does that mean.. -I mean I have to say a new
name.

1050
01:08:05,713 --> 01:08:07,806
James. -James..nice name.

1051
01:08:08,082 --> 01:08:10,846
And last name. -Armani. O Italian.

1052
01:08:11,619 --> 01:08:14,053
You speak Hindi very well.

1053
01:08:15,189 --> 01:08:19,125
Actually the matter is that.. -I am half Italian and half
Indian,

1054
01:08:19,526 --> 01:08:21,391
Like my uncle and grandmother..

1055
01:08:21,829 --> 01:08:24,491
..and my uncle was Toralian and I am Armani..

1056
01:08:24,665 --> 01:08:28,396
Italian Sindi..great! Interesting!

1057
01:08:28,502 --> 01:08:31,801
Can I ask you about yourself?

1058
01:08:32,406 --> 01:08:33,395
Off course.

1059
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:36,065
My name is Sonia and I am a killer.

1060
01:08:37,811 --> 01:08:41,303
I have been charged to kill an Indian Minister.. Y.Y.
Singh.

1061
01:08:41,415 --> 01:08:44,714
What I didn't commit? -Tell me more. -Please tell me
more.

1062
01:08:44,818 --> 01:08:47,514
This Y.Y. Singh was a corrupt minister,

1063
01:08:47,755 --> 01:08:50,189
He had given 500 crore worth diamonds..

1064
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:51,849
..to famous Don Guru Gulfam,

1065
01:08:52,459 --> 01:08:54,689
That's Guru Gulfam who has killed him,

1066
01:08:54,929 --> 01:08:57,329
I want to expose Guru Gulfam,

1067
01:08:57,598 --> 01:09:01,193
And for this I need a nice detective for this mission.

1068
01:09:01,502 --> 01:09:04,596

A new place for your self is like a piece of gold!

1138
01:14:09,476 --> 01:14:12,877
You are still sleeping after drinking all night long!

1139
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:14,774
That's great! -Where am I?

1140

I am not Chatur Singh..I am James Armani!

1144
01:14:29,529 --> 01:14:30,518
James Armani..

1145
01:14:30,631 --> 01:14:34,761
What a great think it took me six months..to change
from Lalum to lalali.

1146
01:14:34,868 --> 01:14:36,768
And you..so fast you have changed from..

1147
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:38,428

01:14:42,576 --> 01:14:43,600
How did I come here?

I saw you sleeping all drunk on the road!

1151
01:14:48,749 --> 01:14:50,740
Why dint you wake me up! -Well it was two pm.

1152
01:14:51,218 --> 01:14:54,210
One, it is really bad waking up someone who is
sleeping!

1153
01:14:54,321 --> 01:14:56,289
And secondly who feels bad if you are still getting
the rent..

1154
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:58,449
..even if your car is switched off..who would feel bad
after all.

1155
01:14:58,558 --> 01:15:00,719
Hello! Give me my one thousand rupees!

1156
01:15:00,827 --> 01:15:02,624

1158
01:15:04,865 --> 01:15:07,595
You have nothing in your pocket..and what will I

01:15:07,701 --> 01:15:09,464
Chatur Singh! -James Armani!

1160

I just don't get angry! That's ok!

1161
01:15:18,378 --> 01:15:19,743
Pappu! Open the door.

1162
01:15:21,114 --> 01:15:22,206
Please open the door!

1163
01:15:24,718 --> 01:15:27,653
Pappu..I know you are standing across the door.

1164
01:15:28,588 --> 01:15:30,317
You will not listen to me like this.

1165
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:18,463
Bali hand shower!

1166
01:16:18,772 --> 01:16:19,761
Wrong boss!

1167
01:16:22,909 --> 01:16:24,706
Bali O shava!

1168
01:16:25,145 --> 01:16:27,579
Shava..bale Boss!

1169
01:16:28,849 --> 01:16:32,615
Bali when I was knocking your door like a mad
man..

1170
01:16:33,186 --> 01:16:35,620
..so you were standing behind the door. -Yes boss!

1171
01:16:36,623 --> 01:16:38,853
And you were watching me from the keyhole. -Yes
boss.

1172
01:16:40,427 --> 01:16:42,861
And still you didn't open the door.

1173
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:44,188
No boss.

1174
01:16:44,865 --> 01:16:47,333
Its because of you I have turned into this condition.

1175
01:16:47,734 --> 01:16:49,361
I dint want to break the rules boss!

1176
01:16:49,669 --> 01:16:51,637
You didn't give me the code and now..

1177
01:16:51,738 --> 01:16:53,569
..you're breaking your own rules.

1178
01:16:57,244 --> 01:16:58,711
Boss..what happened to the mission?

1179
01:17:00,414 --> 01:17:03,076
Well about the mission..now c'mon note it down.

1180
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:09,550
Around three fifteen I realised that Soniya if
innocent!

1181
01:17:10,323 --> 01:17:11,688
Someone is the real killer!

1182
01:17:12,559 --> 01:17:17,622
And Soniya..is madly in love with me.

1183
01:17:17,731 --> 01:17:19,358
No boss..Soniya is the killer!

1184
01:17:22,502 --> 01:17:23,799
Soniya is not the killer!

1185
01:17:24,771 --> 01:17:28,366
I..want.. Sandwich.

1186
01:17:29,242 --> 01:17:33,440
No! I want the diamonds!

1187
01:17:54,267 --> 01:17:56,167
Good morning..Soniya! -Good morning!

1188
01:17:56,570 --> 01:18:00,165
Tell me how am I looks like? Terrible! I mean terrific.

1189
01:18:00,707 --> 01:18:02,470
Well yesterday..

1190
01:18:02,576 --> 01:18:04,237
You have done amazing job,

1191
01:18:04,578 --> 01:18:06,409
Even after drinking so you were still as..

1192
01:18:06,513 --> 01:18:08,276
..solid as a rock like a true Italian.

1193
01:18:09,282 --> 01:18:11,682
We drink this wine in our breakfast,

1194
01:18:11,885 --> 01:18:14,854
It's breakfast time, Shall I make more. -No!

1195
01:18:15,121 --> 01:18:17,089
This bread and butter will work.

1196
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:20,382
Soniya! You didn't ask me why I am wearing this
suit?

1197
01:18:20,894 --> 01:18:23,488
Yes..you have worn a suit! -It's not just a normal suit.

1198
01:18:24,464 --> 01:18:27,865
Before this a famous detective Mr.Shaki has wore
this dress.

1199
01:18:28,335 --> 01:18:29,324
Look at this.

1200
01:18:29,569 --> 01:18:31,867
If someone see me from here then I will look
different.

1201
01:18:32,472 --> 01:18:34,372
Different from here.

1202
01:18:34,708 --> 01:18:37,677
Different from here different from here.

1203
01:18:37,777 --> 01:18:39,404
And if someone will see me from behind..

1204
01:18:39,513 --> 01:18:41,674
..then I will be disappear. -Very smart!

1205
01:18:42,148 --> 01:18:44,673
Shall we go now? Where?

1207
01:18:46,753 --> 01:18:48,550

1208
01:18:49,756 --> 01:18:53,385
Soniya..I must solve this case.

1209
01:18:53,693 --> 01:18:55,217
It's Chatur Singh's promise.

1210
01:18:55,462 --> 01:18:57,657
James Armani, I swear I didn't say Chatur Singh.

1211
01:18:57,764 --> 01:18:59,288
Sorry..my mistake.

1212
01:18:59,399 --> 01:19:00,331
Let's go!

1213
01:19:13,747 --> 01:19:15,408
Who do you want to meet..Sir?

1214
01:19:15,815 --> 01:19:19,273

..he suddenly met with an accident!

Sir! Why did we come here? To catch Chatur Singh.

1322

01:24:52,619 --> 01:24:53,916
..Chatur Singh for another two an half a year!

Ok! -Call a cab.

1326
01:25:06,766 --> 01:25:08,529
Why should we get down from the car?

1327
01:25:08,801 --> 01:25:11,269

01:25:28,221 --> 01:25:29,245
Do you think we look like thief?

1338
01:25:29,355 --> 01:25:30,515
The other guy I met also did not..

..look like a thief from his face! -Who are you talking
about?

1341
01:25:36,863 --> 01:25:38,558
Chatur Singh!

1342
01:25:38,665 --> 01:25:40,155

1348

1350
01:25:55,748 --> 01:25:56,772

How we will find him in Cape Town,

1354
01:26:05,391 --> 01:26:07,291
I can understand your pain Miss Soniya!

1355
01:26:07,727 --> 01:26:10,525
If you want you can put your head on my shoulder
and cry.

1356
01:26:11,297 --> 01:26:13,162
But I am not feeling like crying!

1357
01:26:13,599 --> 01:26:15,294
Then you can sleep on my shoulder..but..

1358
01:26:15,401 --> 01:26:16,732
..I am not feeling sleepy too.

1359
01:26:20,306 --> 01:26:22,570
Why are you saying the same thing in all different
ways!

1360
01:26:22,675 --> 01:26:25,269
Chatur Singh! -I mean James Armani!

1361
01:26:25,578 --> 01:26:28,172
This time the mistake was yours.. -Well sorry, my

01:26:49,335 --> 01:26:50,324
This guy is mad!

1368
01:26:50,603 --> 01:26:53,401
I guess all the people think the same thing about
me!

1369
01:26:53,506 --> 01:26:55,701
But I just dont get it..why I just dont agree to them!

1389
01:27:43,790 --> 01:27:46,190

01:27:53,466 --> 01:27:55,696
And I did the same..and the entire story I am telling

1393
01:27:55,802 --> 01:27:57,360
Why dint you pick him up first!

Why dint you pick up first? -It was him who
kidnapped him!

What do you think this place is..is it a hotel!

1400
01:28:12,819 --> 01:28:15,185
Why do you take all the things so lightly!

1401
01:28:15,421 --> 01:28:17,514
I am the Don of this place!

1402
01:28:17,623 --> 01:28:20,285
Who am I? -Don!

1403
01:28:20,393 --> 01:28:23,692

1410
01:28:42,348 --> 01:28:44,543
One chain you can make it and the other chain I will
make it!

1411
01:28:46,119 --> 01:28:49,816
No! Chain will be mine and the ring will be yours!

1412
01:28:49,922 --> 01:28:53,323

''Now please start talking..we do not have a lot of

1496
01:34:16,549 --> 01:34:21,816
Fun! Is always fun! Who is he? He is the famous Dr.
Jhatka.

01:34:21,921 --> 01:34:23,411
Dr.Jhatka?

1498
01:34:23,522 --> 01:34:26,616
O my God! Where is the patient who needs the
treatment!

1499
01:34:27,726 --> 01:34:29,819
What kind of treatment are you planning to give?

1500
01:34:29,929 --> 01:34:31,658
You dont even have a bag or medicine?

1501
01:34:31,764 --> 01:34:33,493
There is no injections in your pocket too?

1502
01:34:33,599 --> 01:34:34,463
Please tell me that..

1503
01:34:34,567 --> 01:34:36,194
..the style we give our treatments is always
different.

1504
01:34:36,302 --> 01:34:38,770
No Homeopathy..only locopathy!

1505
01:34:39,205 --> 01:34:40,194
What is this?

1506
01:34:40,673 --> 01:34:41,662
What is this?

1507
01:34:42,241 --> 01:34:44,539
Sweetu..who are these new characters?

1508
01:34:44,643 --> 01:34:47,635
Guruji ! He is a doctor and he has come for your
medication.

1509
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:51,179
Am I mad? Yes you are mad.

1510
01:34:53,285 --> 01:34:54,411
Ok..no problem!

1511
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:56,886
Doctor sir! A lot of people have been telling me
that..

1512
01:34:57,156 --> 01:34:58,487
but I just dont listen to them.

1513
01:34:59,492 --> 01:35:01,722
This is a special case when the patient is biting but
is..

1514
01:35:01,827 --> 01:35:04,227
..not accepting the situation according to the Indian
Law.

1515
01:35:04,330 --> 01:35:06,821
This matter is very serious. -You must have watch in
Hindi Movies

1516
01:35:07,099 --> 01:35:12,298
Normally where patient got hit and he lost his
memory,

1517
01:35:12,404 --> 01:35:15,202
If you will hit on the same place then his memory
came back,

1518
01:35:15,307 --> 01:35:17,298
That means let us start hitting him up!

1519
01:35:17,409 --> 01:35:20,139
Wait a second!

1520
01:35:20,913 --> 01:35:23,814
Small things that are round what is it?

1521
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:26,445
Is it diamonds or pulses!

1522
01:35:27,586 --> 01:35:29,076
You want to tell me in my ears.

1523
01:35:31,223 --> 01:35:33,248
Its pulses!

1524
01:35:33,926 --> 01:35:36,861
Why are you hitting me?

1525
01:35:39,865 --> 01:35:42,163
Hit him!

1526
01:35:43,736 --> 01:35:45,601
Guru..

1527
01:35:47,473 --> 01:35:51,136
Where are the diamonds?

1528
01:36:07,293 --> 01:36:09,261
He does not tell only..where are the diamonds!

1529
01:36:09,361 --> 01:36:11,124
What have you done..you killed the only..

1530
01:36:11,230 --> 01:36:12,720
..person who knew about the diamonds!

1531
01:36:15,134 --> 01:36:18,228
Guru..has died..now what is going to happen to
Soniya!

1532
01:36:18,537 --> 01:36:20,630
Now how ill prove myself to be innocent!

1533
01:36:36,889 --> 01:36:41,223
Hey Chuha!Who has woke me up!

1534
01:36:44,229 --> 01:36:46,857
Who are these people..please throw them out of the
house!

1535
01:36:47,533 --> 01:36:50,263
At last this guys memory is back!

1536
01:36:50,669 --> 01:36:54,730
Enough of your drama, Tell me where are the
diamonds.

1537
01:36:55,374 --> 01:36:59,333
My memory is returned but these diamonds will
take my life.

1538
01:36:59,845 --> 01:37:01,369
If you want to save diamonds and..

1539
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:03,072
..your life both then Gullu Gulfam

1540
01:37:03,515 --> 01:37:06,450
Say good bye to your memory.

1541
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:08,414
Bye!

1542
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:11,683
Diamonds!

1543
01:37:12,691 --> 01:37:16,627
Heera is in Punjab. How did heera (diamond) in
Punjab.

1544
01:37:16,895 --> 01:37:19,363
He was born in Punjab.

1545
01:37:19,465 --> 01:37:22,730
He had butter in Punjab, he also lives in punjab!

1546
01:37:22,835 --> 01:37:25,463
Heera..is my uncle!

1547
01:37:25,571 --> 01:37:28,369
Please call my uncle!

1548
01:37:30,142 --> 01:37:33,134
Why are you beating him? What about our
diamonds,

1549
01:37:33,479 --> 01:37:36,243
To hell those 500 crore diamonds.

1550
01:37:36,849 --> 01:37:39,283
Now at least you also get emotional!

1551
01:37:39,385 --> 01:37:41,512
My Chinese heart is also melting.

1552
01:37:42,221 --> 01:37:44,815
When the fortunes..are not in favour then what can
I do!

1553
01:37:48,494 --> 01:37:49,756
I will come and cry and come!

1554
01:37:52,364 --> 01:37:54,389
Thank you! -I know!

1555
01:37:55,167 --> 01:37:58,534
Now put your car in the gear and

1556
01:38:00,472 --> 01:38:01,666
Take him to the highway!

1557
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:07,801
Things that are round..and small..

1558
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:10,548
..are not pulses but are diamonds!

1559
01:38:11,717 --> 01:38:12,706
Diamonds!

1560
01:38:18,557 --> 01:38:21,458
This is not a cherry but Chatur!

1561
01:38:23,262 --> 01:38:25,822
I am the one who can hear the most unusual..

1562
01:38:26,098 --> 01:38:27,690
..noises also..Chatur Singh..

1563
01:38:29,802 --> 01:38:30,791
Two star!

1564
01:38:34,339 --> 01:38:35,363
Who is it!

1565
01:38:39,411 --> 01:38:41,811
Sir..its me!

1566
01:38:43,215 --> 01:38:44,842
I am Pappu Panther..sir you being a lion..

1567
01:38:45,117 --> 01:38:46,379
..and you are scared of a donkey!

1568
01:38:46,485 --> 01:38:49,249
I am not a lion but a donkey. -donkey!

1569
01:38:49,888 --> 01:38:51,515
Half lion and half donkey

1570
01:38:52,591 --> 01:38:54,354
It's a donkey that gets scared not lion's!

1571
01:38:57,563 --> 01:38:59,087
Its me!

1572
01:38:59,732 --> 01:39:02,792
Thank God! -Anyway Mr.Armani this disguise that..

1573
01:39:03,068 --> 01:39:05,036
..you have chosen is just too good!

1574
01:39:07,172 --> 01:39:10,107
Soniya! Nobody must have ever thought..

1575
01:39:10,209 --> 01:39:12,734
..of such a disguise in 1 000 years.

1576
01:39:13,178 --> 01:39:16,238
Gullu Gulfam's memory is returned I will solve this
case.

1577
01:39:16,348 --> 01:39:17,713
I will get 500 crore diamond back..

1578
01:39:17,816 --> 01:39:20,114
..to department and get promoted. -But only yours.

1579
01:39:20,219 --> 01:39:21,208
Then go alone on mission.

1580
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:24,619
If I will get promoted then you will get promotion,

1581
01:39:24,723 --> 01:39:27,283
We are working in same team,

1582
01:39:27,392 --> 01:39:30,828
And since 1 000 years you haven't seen anyone in
this disguise.

1583
01:39:33,799 --> 01:39:36,233
Fun! Fun!

1584
01:39:36,335 --> 01:39:39,793
Sir! -Nobody would've donned such a disguise in a
1000 years.

1585
01:39:40,405 --> 01:39:43,306
Boss, are we quitting the underworld and joining
the circus?

1586
01:39:43,709 --> 01:39:46,405
You've made me a dog and you're roaming around
as a gorilla.

1587
01:39:46,712 --> 01:39:48,441
I need the diamonds.The diamonds.

1588
01:39:48,547 --> 01:39:51,482
Fun! Fun!

1589
01:39:56,655 --> 01:40:00,887
Nobody would've donned this elephant costume in
eons.

1590
01:40:01,293 --> 01:40:03,227
You're a genius, Gullu Gulfam.

1591
01:40:05,531 --> 01:40:06,520
Boss, elephant.

1592
01:40:22,314 --> 01:40:23,338
Diamonds!

1593
01:40:25,150 --> 01:40:26,139
Hey!

1594
01:40:27,219 --> 01:40:32,589
Tiny.. round.. they aren't beans but diamonds.

1595
01:40:33,559 --> 01:40:35,322
Gullu Gulfam's diamonds.

1596
01:40:42,801 --> 01:40:46,237
C'mon! -Take this!

1597
01:40:49,474 --> 01:40:51,908
Something's wrong here. Send the force
immediately.

1598
01:41:03,255 --> 01:41:05,849
Give it to me! -Guru Gulfam's diamonds!

1599
01:41:06,525 --> 01:41:10,291
I'll take the diamonds!

1600
01:41:10,395 --> 01:41:13,489
Diamonds! -Don't let him escape!

1601
01:41:13,799 --> 01:41:15,164
Chase him!

1602
01:41:15,267 --> 01:41:18,236
I have the diamonds! -Nab him!

1603
01:41:18,337 --> 01:41:23,604
Hello. Hello. -Sir, I'm on a mission.Who is it?

1604
01:41:23,709 --> 01:41:25,370
Why have you stopped? Is the signal red?

1605
01:41:25,477 --> 01:41:27,911
Who is it? -Give me the diamonds.

1606
01:41:29,514 --> 01:41:30,674
I'm here.

1607
01:41:35,287 --> 01:41:36,652
C'mon! C'mon!

1608
01:41:53,372 --> 01:41:54,805
She's running with the diamonds!

1609
01:41:54,907 --> 01:41:56,465
Catch it!

1610
01:42:00,612 --> 01:42:03,445
C'mon, pass it on!

1611
01:42:03,548 --> 01:42:05,607
And here's a sixer!

1612
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:10,385
The diamonds are up there.

1613
01:42:13,358 --> 01:42:14,848
Hello, Sinha. -Tell me.

1614
01:42:15,327 --> 01:42:19,354
Where are you? -Flying in the air for a promotion.

1615
01:42:22,334 --> 01:42:25,326
Have you been demoted? -Who is it?

1616
01:42:25,437 --> 01:42:26,597
Pappu Panther.

1617
01:42:28,407 --> 01:42:30,170
Hey! Stop!

1618
01:42:39,851 --> 01:42:42,752
Hello. -Hello, Sinha. -Rajkumar Sinha.Who is this?

1619
01:42:42,854 --> 01:42:44,879
Are you disguised as a rabbit to munch on carrots?

1620
01:42:45,157 --> 01:42:47,216
I'm on a mission here.Who is it?

1621
01:42:47,326 --> 01:42:49,726
Pappu Panther. -Pappu Panther?

1622
01:42:50,329 --> 01:42:51,853
How dare you call me Sinha?

1623
01:42:51,964 --> 01:42:53,693
Then should I call you Bachchan?

1624
01:42:53,799 --> 01:42:56,461
That's also true. If he doesn't call me Sinha..

1625
01:42:57,235 --> 01:42:58,463
Pappu!

1626
01:43:00,672 --> 01:43:03,072
Hey!Where have you made me climb?

1627
01:43:03,175 --> 01:43:04,870
I want the diamonds.

1628
01:43:12,451 --> 01:43:14,351
I'm the gorilla don!

1629
01:43:16,521 --> 01:43:17,783
Armani, catch!

1630
01:43:18,590 --> 01:43:21,684
Yes, well done! -Why did you throw the diamonds,
deer?

1631
01:43:32,504 --> 01:43:35,337
Hey Armani, where are the diamonds?

1632
01:43:35,941 --> 01:43:38,910
Which ones? -You were standing there and I threw it
to you.

1633
01:43:39,478 --> 01:43:40,467
Think about it.

1634
01:43:44,549 --> 01:43:45,743
Who is the other lion?

1635
01:44:06,671 --> 01:44:08,696
Diamonds! Diamonds!

1636
01:44:09,641 --> 01:44:11,871
Pappu Panther reporting, sir! -Stop!

1637
01:44:13,578 --> 01:44:14,636
Take off your mask.

1638
01:44:23,889 --> 01:44:24,878
You?!

1639
01:44:27,559 --> 01:44:29,424
Savitri madam, you?

1640
01:44:30,796 --> 01:44:32,730
That means, Charlie.. -Yes.

1641
01:44:33,865 --> 01:44:36,459
I killed my husband Y.Y. Singh.

1642
01:44:37,869 --> 01:44:40,394
And I used you for this job.

1643
01:44:42,407 --> 01:44:47,276
Death was very cheap for that corrupt man.

1644
01:44:47,813 --> 01:44:50,509
That two bit insurance agent wanted..

1645
01:44:50,615 --> 01:44:52,810
..my father's political empire.

1646
01:44:54,619 --> 01:44:56,484
And he killed my father.

1647
01:44:58,490 --> 01:45:00,651
He confiscated all the property.

1648
01:45:02,661 --> 01:45:04,128
That's why I killed him.

1649
01:45:04,229 --> 01:45:06,561
Ma'am, we all are very sorry to hear your story.

1650
01:45:07,399 --> 01:45:09,594
But I am sorry you are a criminal under law.

1651
01:45:10,235 --> 01:45:11,361
That's why Kulkarni..

1652
01:45:11,470 --> 01:45:12,664
Sir! -Arrest her.

1653
01:45:13,305 --> 01:45:14,670
Sir. Madam, please.

1654
01:45:16,108 --> 01:45:17,097
Shall we go?

1655
01:45:18,143 --> 01:45:19,269
Chatur Singh. -Yes, sir.

1656
01:45:21,313 --> 01:45:22,780
Give me those diamonds.Why sir?

1657
01:45:22,881 --> 01:45:24,508
Because I am your senior and those..

1658
01:45:24,616 --> 01:45:26,106
..small diamonds are expensive.

1659
01:45:26,218 --> 01:45:27,879
I will keep them safe.

1660
01:45:28,887 --> 01:45:30,115
Pappu. -Yes, boss.

1661
01:45:30,522 --> 01:45:31,511
Note it down.

1662
01:45:32,157 --> 01:45:34,853
1 2th October, at 2.40 in the afternoon..

1663
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:37,653
..the diamonds in Chatur Singh's hands..

1664
01:45:37,796 --> 01:45:40,424
I won't hand it over to the commissioner.

1665
01:45:40,532 --> 01:45:43,899
What are you saying? -I'll hand it over to the DGP.
-Yes, boss.

1666
01:45:44,169 --> 01:45:45,466
Kulkarni! -Waiting, sir.

1667
01:45:45,570 --> 01:45:47,538
James Armani! -Truly, I didn't take it.

1668
01:45:47,639 --> 01:45:49,630
Naturally, my fault.

1669
01:45:50,175 --> 01:45:52,643
But atleast agree now, Mr. Chatur Singh.

1670
01:45:56,815 --> 01:45:58,840
Taxi! Taxi!

1671
01:45:59,518 --> 01:46:01,383
Accident! Taxi!

1672
01:46:01,486 --> 01:46:04,853
Gullu!Taxi, shop, train, all are done.

1673
01:46:05,357 --> 01:46:07,382
Now a straight flight to Mumbai.

1674
01:46:09,728 --> 01:46:11,320
Kulkarni! -Yes, sir.

1675
01:46:12,230 --> 01:46:15,063
After getting the diamonds, my BP is normal.

1676
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:16,565
Sir, have another pill.

1677
01:46:16,668 --> 01:46:18,795
I don't need it. You must need it.

1678
01:46:19,237 --> 01:46:21,205
You'll need it after hearing the news I've brought.

1679
01:46:21,306 --> 01:46:23,206
I got promoted. No, sir.

1680
01:46:23,308 --> 01:46:24,297
Anymore guesses?

1681
01:46:25,310 --> 01:46:27,244
Something to do with Chatur Singh? -Yes, sir.

1682
01:46:27,345 --> 01:46:29,575
What happened to him? Chatur Singh is not 2 star
anymore.

1683
01:46:30,448 --> 01:46:32,211
He committed suicide. -No, sir.

1684
01:46:32,551 --> 01:46:34,712
Chatur Singh 2 star is now Chatur Singh 3 stars.

1685
01:46:49,134 --> 01:46:50,123
Sir, control!

1686
01:46:50,268 --> 01:46:52,361
I can't control it anymore.

1687
01:46:53,271 --> 01:46:56,604
I'm not even sneezing.

1688
01:47:04,182 --> 01:47:06,776
Boss, what are we doing in this shop?

1689
01:47:08,119 --> 01:47:11,350
Fool, new mission.

1690
01:47:12,424 --> 01:47:13,413
New disguise.

1691
01:47:14,392 --> 01:47:16,622
Chatur Singh 3 stars.

1692
01:47:16,728 --> 01:47:16,861
Chatur Singh!

1693
01:47:16,861 --> 01:47:19,557
Chatur Singh!

1694
01:47:22,901 --> 01:47:28,430
''If the cock lays eggs, I think so.'

1695
01:47:30,408 --> 01:47:34,242
''Oh gosh! Cock laying eggs?''

1696
01:47:36,681 --> 01:47:42,244
''If the cock lays eggs, I think so.'

1697
01:47:43,655 --> 01:47:49,116
''It's my own wish. I do what I want to.''

1698
01:47:59,371 --> 01:48:03,034
''I'm Chatur Singh, 2 star.''

1699
01:48:03,275 --> 01:48:06,073
''I'm Chatur Singh, 2 star.''

1700
01:48:06,211 --> 01:48:09,544
''I'm Chatur Singh, 2 star.''

1701
01:48:09,681 --> 01:48:12,809
''I'm Chatur Singh, Singh.. Singh..''

1702
01:48:13,118 --> 01:48:16,576
''I'm Chatur Singh, 2 star.''

1703
01:48:16,721 --> 01:48:19,781
''I'm Chatur Singh, 2 star.''

1704
01:48:20,258 --> 01:48:23,250
''I'm Chatur Singh, 2 star.''

1705
01:48:23,395 --> 01:48:26,592
''I'm Chatur Singh, Singh.. Singh..''

1706
01:48:31,636 --> 01:48:33,467
I've checked this area completely.

1707
01:48:34,472 --> 01:48:37,600
This area is safe. No problem.

1708
01:48:38,476 --> 01:48:41,536
In my presence, even a bird can't flap its wings here.

1709
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:43,643
Hey!What's this?

1710
01:48:43,782 --> 01:48:45,249
Don't worry.

1711
01:48:46,251 --> 01:48:49,311
This is a chicken. I thought it must be an eagle.

1712
01:48:49,921 --> 01:48:52,788
But no, the cock will surely lay eggs.

1713
01:48:54,893 --> 01:48:57,862
''Superman is my cronie.'

1714
01:48:58,363 --> 01:49:01,161
''He plays kabaddi with me.''

1715
01:49:01,666 --> 01:49:04,499
''Spiderman told me yesterday..''

1716
01:49:05,170 --> 01:49:07,730
''..that Chatur Singh rules here.''

1717
01:49:08,173 --> 01:49:10,300
''The fool will eat the doughnut.'

1718
01:49:11,576 --> 01:49:13,601
''The dumb will sing in his mind.''

1719
01:49:14,779 --> 01:49:16,838
''The river flows backwards..''

1720
01:49:18,350 --> 01:49:20,318
''..let it flow so, if it does.''

1721
01:49:25,724 --> 01:49:27,316
Nice statue, man.

1722
01:49:30,362 --> 01:49:34,128
''I'm Chatur Singh, 2 star.''

1723
01:49:34,566 --> 01:49:37,467
