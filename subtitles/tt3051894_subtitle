00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:10,982
'Cigarette smoking
is injurious to health.'

2
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,132
'Cigarette smoking
is injurious to health.'

3
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:23,124
It can cause cancer.

4
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,672
Which way to go?
Which is our way back home?

5
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,816
Let's go look.

6
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,465
Hello...Psychiatry

7
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,801
Yes I know. At the Outdoor?

8
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,395
Sir Alcoholic...

9
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:45,471
He has recommended
admission day after.

10
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,037
We'll be there sir.

11
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,545
Are they waiting? - Yes, at the OPD.

12
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,978
Withdrawal and alcohol.

13
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,523
Hardly eats. Self neglect.

14
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,988
Bottle and some fags,
that's all he lives on.

15
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,324
Wife ?

16
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,558
There with him . Dire straits.

17
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,532
Poor thing is looking for a job.

18
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:12,296
How old is he ?

19
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,697
Forty four.
Though he looks seventy four.

20
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,639
As a kid I watched him play
Raghupati in Tagore's "Bishorjon".

21
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,306
We might get letters from
the Prime Minister's office.

22
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,045
Heard he's quite close to him.
Arrange for accommodation.

23
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,651
We better admit him day after. - Okay.

24
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,724
Sir, have you watched
his film 'Runaway'?

25
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:37,323
It's about a boy who
runs away from home. Fun!

26
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,455
Do I have the time to?
Only his 'Beyond the Clouds'.

27
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,329
He was found lying sloshed,
in an alley near the cemetery...

28
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,027
...frothing at the mouth.

29
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:48,628
He has three kids at home.
No sense of responsibility!

30
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,073
Irresponsible.

31
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:06,617
The overtures of
Beethoven's the symphony...

32
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:08,957
I can see it!

33
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,018
Dugga will go away.

34
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,427
Surge, swell Oh! mighty waves"

35
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,006
Smash, shatter as shackles do break...

36
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:28,068
Yonder, a new dawn peeps
as souls arise so long asleep.

37
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,574
It's all burning!

38
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,582
The entire universe...

39
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,785
...so am I!

40
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,581
Father, we are leaving.

41
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,787
Won't you visit us ?

42
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,527
So, you're leaving Dugga.

43
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,399
You are taking Satya away from me too?

44
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,563
Separation is essential.

45
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,930
I will not let you go.

46
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,671
Amidst these plains of
ends unknown a single cry".

47
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,712
"Rents heaven and earth

48
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,876
ancient chants...

49
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,510
of deep...

50
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,511
despair.

51
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,079
I will not let you go.

52
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:16,888
A revolutionary war is a people's war.

53
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,689
With the help of mass uprisings
and only by depending on the mass...

54
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,185
...the war can be continued.

55
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:26,159
"Up and down, the water is moving"

56
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,930
"From one side to the other.."

57
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:36,040
"The boat's helm is moving"

58
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,910
After a year of the President's
rule in West Bengal...

59
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,484
...the United Front government's
newly elected Chief Minister...

60
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,144
...spoke of bringing
back peace to West Bengal.

61
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:49,523
"We have no language...
no homeland..."

62
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:58,092
"In the midst of the forest,
the animal is making noise"

63
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:04,971
"In silver and golden shades,
at the bank of Ganges"

64
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:16,212
"We have no destination...
no homeland..."

65
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:23,688
"We have no destination...
no homeland..."

66
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:39,534
"..where did the crop go"

67
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:44,815
"..where did the crop go"

68
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:51,946
"We have no language...
no homeland..."

69
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:59,189
"We have no language...
no homeland..."

70
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:09,935
"The honeybees are
playing on the flowers.."

71
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:13,874
"The honeybees are
playing on the flowers.."

72
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,981
Nilkantha Bagchi.
- It's the rehab case right?

73
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,011
Cabin three.

74
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,279
Which way?

75
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:23,651
Sir.

76
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,813
I find myself akin to your Nirmala.

77
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,825
It's the same story in all households.

78
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,828
That was a cakewalk for me.

79
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:38,085
"The bees are playing
on the flowers.."

80
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:54,812
"We have no language...
no homeland..."

81
00:07:54,907 --> 00:08:01,916
"We have no destination...
no homeland..."

82
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,370
All ok?

83
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,876
Please come in.

84
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,215
All good?

85
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:40,822
Mrs. Bagchi...
the admission form.- Come.

86
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,397
Phulmoni...and she's Damini.

87
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,239
Your cabin.

88
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,243
So this is where the evil
which is to be eliminated.

89
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,814
The son of Shiva and
Parvati shall be born here.

90
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,826
How long is my exile here?

91
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,358
Quoting from our epic 'Kumarsambhava'.

92
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:18,997
I was thinking of translating
it's eighth chapter over here.

93
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,269
Mr.Bagchi, you are a talented man.

94
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,176
You need to get better.

95
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,179
You just have to take
your medicines regularly.

96
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,445
What is it that ails me Doctor ?
Is it the bottle ?

97
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,283
That is the symptom.

98
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:41,722
The real reason is something else.
- The lad's caught on!

99
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,685
So what is the reason?

100
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,191
That has to be investigated.

101
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,263
Sister!

102
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,697
And the procedure of
that investigation Doctor?

103
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,100
Jung or Adler ?

104
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,170
Pavlov or Freud?

105
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:02,212
Please take rest now,
we'll discuss all this later.

106
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,472
Oh...

107
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:07,376
"so if we're not talking right now,
I'll go get some fresh air.

108
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,009
You're not going anywhere.

109
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:12,288
No, I promise I'll come back here.

110
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,448
I promise.

111
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,919
I've loads of work pending.
- Mr.Bagchi please...

112
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,825
Don't be difficult. Be seated.

113
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,795
Give me some money. - No.

114
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,824
You will hit the bottle again...
you won't come back.

115
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,496
This is not your shoot Mr.Bagchi.

116
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,899
I am the director here.
So my word is final.

117
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,231
Sit.

118
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,776
So be it!

119
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:38,745
Very stubborn man.

120
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,215
Creative as well.

121
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,216
Doctor...please take care of him.

122
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:49,087
He's very headstrong.
I have no one to fall back on...

123
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,751
Don't worry...

124
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,428
...he'll be fine here.

125
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,255
Thank you.

126
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,033
What happened ?

127
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,441
Sir, please see. - What's wrong?

128
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,173
She was complaing
of regular headaches.

129
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,408
No,thank you..
- Let me check your pulse.

130
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,822
The headaches are possibly
because of stress.

131
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,393
Get her to the consultancy. - Come.

132
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:24,961
Been working too hard ?

133
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,025
I'm looking for a job...
sitting for exams".

134
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,794
So I've been
studying day and night.

135
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:34,238
She's determined to take up teaching.

136
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,103
I don't really earn anything...

137
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,940
"but we have many mouths to feed.

138
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,481
It's all messed up.

139
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,987
You know Dugga...

140
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,590
...our poet Kalidasa was...

141
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,459
...actually illiterate.

142
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,357
But the princess?

143
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:06,502
...fell head over heels
in love and ended up marrying him.

144
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,408
But after a few days...

145
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:14,470
bullcrap...

146
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,911
...all her love vanished! - Quiet!

147
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:18,541
I know.

148
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,854
A distraught Kalidasa...

149
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,285
left home in sorrow...

150
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,487
...in pursuit of knowledge.

151
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,990
Kalidasa! - I have a headache.

152
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,861
After attaining wisdom..

153
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,907
...when Kalidasa returned
home triumphant...

154
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:49,912
...Princess Viddottama asked him...

155
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,879
if he was now her equal,
with the wisdom he had gained.

156
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,621
What did Kalidasa do on hearing this ?

157
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,025
Wrote three entire epics.

158
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,521
Dinner is served. Finish it fast.

159
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,996
Stop blabbering.

160
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,593
And you have not been
able to become equal with me.

161
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,398
You've made six films..
so many plays and documentaries.

162
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,472
Can anyone call you a gentleman?

163
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,451
Come!

164
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,127
Do you play cards? Twenty nine?

165
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,928
We play"-

166
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,470
...everyday.

167
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:51,974
Entertainment.

168
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,469
Good morning Mr.Bagchi.

169
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,506
Good morning.

170
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,445
Let's see...

171
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,014
...did you sleep well last night?

172
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,716
That beastly cough troubled
me the whole night.

173
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,529
It will be better soon,
the treatment has just begun.

174
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,228
So, how do you like it here?

175
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,699
What so different between
the world outside and the one inside?

176
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:28,474
Just that a booze den
is missing inside, that's it.

177
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:34,213
I realize you've migrated
from East Bengal.

178
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,513
Can there be two Bengals, East & West?

179
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,525
But you're right.

180
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,133
Bharenga, Pabna district.

181
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,396
So why suddenly Kolkata ?

182
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,998
And then People's theatre ?

183
00:14:56,762 --> 00:15:01,438
People's theatre!

184
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,221
It's so stuffy inside!

185
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,692
Intellectuals in politics.

186
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,424
Romain Holland. Maxim Gorky.

187
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,625
Good morning sir. - Good morning.

188
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,463
Why that smirk?

189
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,232
So was this coming together
of the artists wrong ?

190
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,097
It was inevitable.

191
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,166
While still in Rajshahi...

192
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,180
...I had felt the heat.

193
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,344
My intermediate examinations
were going on.

194
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,455
Back then we were
publishing a magazine.

195
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,620
Which one?

196
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,186
New Wave.

197
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,066
Stories, poetry...

198
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,334
I too had some inclination
towards politics.

199
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:07,074
It intensified when I was at
the Krishnanath college of Baharampur.

200
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,341
Radical politics ?

201
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,248
Do you expect the agitated populace..

202
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,343
...to dance the Hula
in those turbulent times?

203
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,483
Bloody hell.

204
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,090
Four million people died from...

205
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,352
...that famine.

206
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,224
Bhoba, come

207
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,360
...today we will
rehearse all night long.

208
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,203
A fire burns without...

209
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:40,606
Whose conch is it that
awakens the multitude!

210
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,746
Whence echoes these
wails of deep despair...

211
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,706
From the darkest dungeons...

212
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,142
In a speech at the
Berlin Sportpalast...

213
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,552
German propaganda minister
Joseph Goebbels...

214
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:55,625
declares a total
war against the Allies.

215
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:58,194
In the Soviet Union,
the Battle of Stalingrad...

216
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,252
comes to an end with
the official surrender...

217
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,826
Mother, give us food, give us food.

218
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:57,183
Act 1 Scene 4. The court
yard of the village head man.

219
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,325
No no...no way...

220
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:05,486
Let this bit remain.

221
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,892
I won't sell this bit. Rest of
it is all gone. Won't sell this bit.

222
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:13,825
They took away all the
paddy luring people with money...

223
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,963
and now they are after our lands!

224
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,366
Tell them, this land is not for sale.

225
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,376
Not for sale?!

226
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,201
How dare you!

227
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,613
You are going back
on your word Mr.Headman,

228
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,513
You are going back !!!

229
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,950
Thrown out from their village,
Kunjo and the Head man...

230
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,655
...descend to make a
home on the Kolkata footpaths.

231
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:36,521
Act 2 Scene 2.

232
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,760
Make way please. Hey!

233
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,830
Have you got the dole ?

234
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,402
The dole ?

235
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:49,302
I mean that porridge.

236
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,797
No.

237
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:55,239
No food.

238
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,577
No clothes.

239
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,643
No roof.

240
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,521
Err.. Mukherjee...

241
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,955
Please try to make her smile.

242
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,754
Just a bit of smile.

243
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,418
Please try... my friend...

244
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:12,552
Smile !

245
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:15,826
"Fickle tickle...

246
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:17,990
What are you doing ?

247
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,600
Let her go. - Leave her!

248
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:25,800
Then I can name the
photograph Bengal's 'Madonna.'

249
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,936
Leave us alone!
- What's going on here?

250
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,911
Leave us alone! - You cannot
stop our theatre like this!

251
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,279
You cannot stop our
theatre in this way!

252
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,292
Who's there?

253
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,956
Which son of a gun ?

254
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:50,827
What's all 'this!

255
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:55,929
This is an unauthorized intrusion.
You can check our registers.

256
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,339
We have orders.
We don't need warrants.

257
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,502
Who is there in this cabin here ?
- Mr. Bagchi.

258
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,877
Nilkantha Bagchi.
Cultural activist. Cabin 3.

259
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,743
Oh !This drunkard
is your inmate too now!

260
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:09,649
So how come you uniformed
angels are here for...

261
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,449
for a sermon on righteous
living in an asylum?

262
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,354
Waste of time. Let's check
the other cabins. - One minute.

263
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:17,485
Sister. Com e.

264
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:18,955
Come. - Come.

265
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,729
You need to pay your way
to see an intellectual in a zoo.

266
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,356
Pay up you bastards!

267
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,391
All your dirty money!

268
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:29,104
Mr.Bagchi, quiet. Relax!

269
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:34,401
Please take rest.
So sorry you got disturbed.

270
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,412
What got these fuckers
so prompt today ?

271
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,778
Relax Mr. Bagchi.

272
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:43,375
They must've postered the
piss walls with death threats again.

273
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,484
So their balls have all shrivelled.

274
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,754
They have information...

275
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,856
...a Naxalite is hiding here...

276
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,362
...disguised as an insane inmate.

277
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,365
Disguise ? Why do you say 'disguise' ?

278
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,590
Only insane people can trade
a bright future outside the country...

279
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,102
...to cleanse the shit
holes of their motherland!

280
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:01,996
Have some water.

281
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,009
Oh my God !

282
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,527
Therefore...

283
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,690
...we got involved.

284
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,657
'We', as in ?

285
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,396
'We' who...

286
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,937
...borrow money for our tea and fags.

287
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:39,840
...our singing sessions,
our theatre... our squabbles.

288
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,712
There used to be a
cafe in South Calcutta.

289
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,504
Thinker's Paradise.

290
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,613
That's where we used to sit around...

291
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,151
...rebuilding our nation.

292
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,811
We'd talk about change!

293
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:53,853
And then borrow money to get married.

294
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,082
As in?

295
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,009
Heard about Chandanpiri ? - Yes.

296
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,734
Head it in the paper.
The peasants are up in arms.

297
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,708
Armed uprising!

298
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,040
Our relief team has gone there.

299
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:25,746
But there is no news of our men...
Mohit, Ramen, Satyabrata, there.

300
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:26,912
What do we do?

301
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,083
Shoot at sight orders are on.
- Oh no !

302
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,524
Now what Bhoba?

303
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,026
What are the leaders of
People's Theatre Group saying ?

304
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,859
Booking fancy theatre
halls as bullets fly there.

305
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,990
For them it's art for art's sake.

306
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,592
Why will they bother
about the poor farmers?

307
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,671
Damn fools...

308
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,606
Bhoba calm down...

309
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,636
So many events in quick succession...

310
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,604
second Great war...Indian
freedom struggle...

311
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,471
black marketing... famine, riots...

312
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:55,017
Now its Kakdwip..Telengana...Naval
Mutiny...

313
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,711
The people are seething.

314
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:58,719
But what does it all indicate ?

315
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:00,615
What?

316
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:03,719
Change!

317
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:10,760
I'm leaving.

318
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,199
Lights !!!

319
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,969
Could you switch them off nurse?

320
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,768
They haven't seen riots...

321
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:53,301
nor famine...

322
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,668
nor war...

323
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,770
nor death...

324
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,662
fighting within the parliament...

325
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:16,329
So will the very definition
of revolution change ?

326
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,170
What's that Mohit ?
Writing film songs ?

327
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,569
No...poetry... will you hear them?

328
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,035
Poetry

329
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:28,204
that's not for me...

330
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:32,644
Poetry and me are chalk and cheese.

331
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:36,882
You look frail Bhoba...

332
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,147
...you've changed a lot...

333
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,986
...in the last few years...

334
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,992
You look much older. - Yes.

335
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,621
These days I cough if I raise slogans.

336
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,925
Sudden bouts.

337
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,829
Have a perfumed kerchief guys?

338
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,697
Doctor's diagnosis ?

339
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,603
One side of the river
erodes as the other builds.

340
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:05,238
One burns so as to illuminate others.

341
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:09,211
That was the point of our struggle,
right comrade ?

342
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:13,349
Ketoki is doing great now
as a movie actress Bhoba. So mind it.

343
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,053
Shut up...

344
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,885
...what about you guys?
Running to Bombay for money?

345
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:21,364
Remember that poem of Salil's ?

346
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:23,796
Stand by in fields,
forests and towns..

347
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,800
"Stand by in harbours,
woods and grounds...

348
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,363
Do you smell something burning?
- What's wrong?

349
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:33,398
Aren't you getting
a burning smell ? I am!

350
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:37,738
What happened?
- Ahalya, Batashi...Sarojini...

351
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:39,374
Uttami...

352
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:40,741
...they are all ablaze.

353
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,977
All abaze!

354
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,180
All's aflame.

355
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,384
Bhoba, where are you off to ?

356
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,357
Listen... Bhoba please.
- Bhobha where are you going?

357
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:53,361
Heard the latest?
Bhoba's run away from home ?

358
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,288
Uncle Bishtu's son Bhoba ?

359
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,799
Who else ?

360
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,130
Wayward lad...

361
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:00,665
...he's run off to some
place called Kanpur"

362
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,261
...to work in the cotton mills...

363
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,703
...no studies" nothing.

364
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,002
Wait, Bhoba.
Don't leave. - Bhoba, Bhoba!

365
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:10,807
In the fields, the ports,
the cities and villages" prepare!

366
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:15,912
Those snuggling in the eternal
darks of their unlit homes.. prepare!

367
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:21,349
Those with hungry stomachs
and dried up faces...prepare!

368
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:25,325
This is a call to all the
homes in the land, prepare. Unite!

369
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:40,334
Our soil belongs to our soiled hands!

370
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:44,244
Our soil belongs to our soiled hands!

371
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:49,752
Our soil belongs to our soiled hands!

372
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,738
Endless clouds of unshed rain..

373
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,471
...clinging on to the
skies in dirge despair...

374
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:19,272
...as they mourned the denied life.

375
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:22,181
Claiming the child
his right to live...

376
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,947
...no seed raised a tiny head

377
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:34,020
No butterfly spread
its cocooned wings...

378
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:39,061
Kakdwip was not the same that night.

379
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:41,197
Head the poem ?

380
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,972
Was abroad at that time
but have heard about it.

381
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,841
But why were poor farmer's
wives fired upon ?

382
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,937
Because they had freed Kakdwip.

383
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,780
Which ruler tolerates...

384
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:57,249
free subjects in his rule?

385
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:04,316
Came to Kolkata...

386
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,996
...for higher studies...

387
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:11,293
...a defeated poet
like all good Bengali boys.

388
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:17,234
That smell wafts into the
wards and it's harmful for you too.

389
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,809
We are fire eaters...

390
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,545
...wouldn't have stubbed
it out in those days.

391
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,213
Non conformist ?

392
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,410
Conform where my boy ?

393
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,249
No roots, no encumbrance,

394
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:35,085
just a homeless refugee boy...
- Sir...

395
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:38,951
What? - Sir, can we say something?

396
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:43,889
Sir, Bhushon saw someone burning
up a book and flee last night.

397
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:45,934
Why.. why burn a book?

398
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:50,506
After that police raid, may be
they wanted to make the book vanish.

399
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:52,501
Com plain to the Superintendent.

400
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,602
What will I do ?
Treat the ill or play hide and seek?

401
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,915
What book ?
- We can't read the entire thing.

402
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:01,074
Piecing the burnt fragments...
' How to be...

403
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,016
...a Good Communist'.

404
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,053
Okay you guys carry on.
I will look in to the matter.

405
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,629
How did you know
the name of the book ?

406
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,437
It was our ABC...

407
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:24,329
...like learning the alphabets.

408
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:27,542
Where are you my dear
Boudi (sister in law)?

409
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,636
Here comes your tutor.

410
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,447
He's completely head over heels.
Coming over twice a day to teach.

411
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,952
Here we are. Come in.

412
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:40,387
So where's my 'Das Kapital' ?

413
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:45,184
Could I have a cup of tea please ?

414
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:50,024
Really, you've got
an angel in your house.

415
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:54,295
You people sit.

416
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,075
Got you two new books.

417
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:09,082
It is the language of my protest...

418
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,176
It is my dissent's...

419
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,021
flame.

420
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:18,150
May it burn twice it's life.

421
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,935
If you wish to reach the
grassroots in this country...

422
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,535
you have to dig into our soil.

423
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,237
Just reading Leu Shao Qui won't do.

424
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,947
Great activist!

425
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,175
Welcome Ma'am.

426
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,212
How do you find him ?

427
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,479
Good !

428
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,956
Seem happy 101153! 7

429
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:57,660
That's because the cops came
in the morning, called me a drunkard.

430
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:05,474
I've asked Ramen da(brotherly).
They live close by. They'll com e.

431
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,202
Just a few more days here.

432
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:13,972
You've to recover fast
and get back to work now.

433
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:22,321
Don't be late, times are bad.

434
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,587
Was behind bars when
the party was underground,

435
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,699
maybe you've forgotten.

436
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,602
You were better off in prison...

437
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,596
than with me, in yet another prison.

438
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,047
No Doctor...

439
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,009
it's apparent...

440
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,519
I keep working but I cannot proceed,

441
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:53,020
even if I proceed I cannot finish.

442
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:57,622
Have you progressed
with your translation?

443
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:02,596
It was progressing but
then an obstacle came by.

444
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,268
The Santhal girl in the next cabin...

445
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,772
...she is upsetting it all.

446
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:13,335
Phulmoni ?

447
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:16,306
What's happened to her ?

448
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:18,580
She has gone mute.

449
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,116
Got raped by some army
personnel in the jungle.

450
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,681
In her veins runs the
revolutionary blood of..

451
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:27,049
...Sidhu and Kanu,
leader of Kol and Santhal rebellion.

452
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,247
Beware.

453
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:33,060
If they get mad all your
state machinery is finished!

454
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:35,693
My state machinery ?

455
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:37,230
Not yours? - No!

456
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:39,762
It never was.

457
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:43,472
This so called independence
by stabbing us in the back...

458
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:48,203
...we never accepted it.
never will. And anyway"

459
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:57,654
How on yonder boatman...

460
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:06,357
my broken boat is
on the deep deep sea...

461
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,856
POW on...

462
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:15,764
row on my boatman...

463
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:23,208
my broken boat is
on the deep deep sea...

464
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:40,185
Have seen three of your films.

465
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:47,227
Didn't understand much,
but they look like paintings.

466
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,304
And what about my
thoughts you rascal ?

467
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,334
They were also nice...

468
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,669
...but... - ...could not understand.

469
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,371
I have understood...

470
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,681
I am gratified...

471
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,613
now be of some help
my understanding rascal?

472
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,210
Just say...

473
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,330
Can I smuggle in...

474
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,833
some booze out here ?

475
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:25,865
The Democratic police force can
rape a political prisoner in custody.

476
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,704
"Desher Broto" has brainwashed you.

477
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:34,682
Pass on some bucks now,
you disgraced intellectual.

478
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:36,579
Right !!!

479
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,221
What?

480
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:42,186
What's happening here ?

481
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,586
Back to your wards.

482
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,233
Where is it?

483
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,318
Amazing!!!

484
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,880
This is Einstein!!!

485
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,390
...coming out.

486
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,360
Long years ago...

487
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,555
we made a tryst with destiny,

488
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:36,795
and now the time comes...

489
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,958
when we shall redeem our pledge...

490
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,469
at the stroke of the midnight hour,

491
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,003
when the world sleeps,

492
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:46,006
India will awake to life and freedom .

493
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:08,687
Hey!

494
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,499
Mahatma Gandhi was shot,

495
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,000
and killed this evening
by a Hindu fanatic.

496
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:16,935
The man who identified
himself as one Nathuram,

497
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,438
fired a fourth shot,

498
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,973
apparently in an
effort to kill himself.

499
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:22,909
An infuriated crowd...

500
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,606
fell upon the man,
and beat him with sticks.

501
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:50,563
Hey! You scoundrel!

502
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,309
We assert that after
the transfer of power...

503
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:15,777
on 15th August 1947,

504
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:17,853
a section of the left leadership...

505
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:19,649
feel that revolution is just,

506
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:22,587
around the corner and
that this freedom is fake.

507
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,377
We have to avenge this!

508
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,780
The gunned down Haramadhav and Sun.

509
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:55,947
Haruda'a house was ransacked.

510
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,782
I can't believe our
country is free now!

511
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:00,089
I have a problem with
the word 'freedom', Gurudas.

512
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:02,219
Its because of these sarcastic
jibes of you people...

513
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:05,930
that Monishonkar da,
Rajani da have left our group.

514
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,165
Pratap da's theater
group is going great guns.

515
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,398
These newspapers are having
a field day. - Let them!

516
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,307
The government doesn't want
us in parliamentary politics, right?

517
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:16,378
It's our mistake, we're wrong in
insisting that the freedom is false.

518
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,671
This is Anarchism.
Who are you calling anarchists?

519
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,081
The poor farmers of Dongajora
or the theatre people?

520
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:23,140
Why are they being butchered?

521
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,078
They are getting intimidated by us.

522
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:27,649
I can foresee an uprising.

523
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:29,722
We should carry on
with our theatre work.

524
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:31,989
Err.. why don't we..

525
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:36,922
Rename our Central Squad
as our 'Troop Brigade'?

526
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,100
Boudi (sisterinlaw) can
I get a few mouths of food ?

527
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:45,000
Drink some water,
that's what you need first.

528
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:48,435
I'm acting in Samarda's
film which is about refugees.

529
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,406
Nitai da has called
to assist in his shoot

530
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,339
On the other hand there
is the zonal meet...

531
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:55,110
Listen, we are into politics too.

532
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:56,183
Everyone does.

533
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,085
But that is no excuse,
for your Vagabond existence.

534
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,981
Now go take a bath.

535
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:05,821
" The storm crashes on to
the blazing for head" understand?

536
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:09,755
You need a wife.

537
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:22,173
Dugga's from Shillong.

538
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:27,146
I'm her tutor here.

539
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,477
They still get trapped !

540
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,120
Your novels are so popular back home.

541
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:39,821
Which ones ?
- "Mohakaal", "Dheu","Bhangon"

542
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,390
Satyabrata is a genuine
people's author, Dugga.

543
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:47,131
Much like you he's been imprisoned
for his activism. Tea anyone?

544
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:49,027
Really?

545
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,498
Getting paid for drilling
sense into wood... tuition..

546
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:55,505
...so, trying to repay your debts.

547
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,001
Who's the wood?

548
00:43:57,935 --> 00:43:59,937
Madan. Give Ma'm a cup of tea.

549
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,209
You still owe me for three months.

550
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:07,521
Now you know...

551
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:10,886
studies are fine...

552
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,494
...then you'll realize you're trapped.

553
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:17,491
Some difficult love letters
will arrive alongwith a grocery list.

554
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,096
Enough. Your tea.

555
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:22,367
That is obvious your
friend is a romantic.

556
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:28,274
Romantic, yes. But the
love letters won’t have any romance.

557
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:32,071
Dimitrov facts and CPO testaments"
these will be all.

558
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:33,237
Rascal.

559
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,059
What are you looking at?

560
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:56,904
My mother.

561
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:00,872
What a face... what fire.

562
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:04,912
Had made some documentaries,
for the Bihar government...

563
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,817
Saw them up close.

564
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,579
Our true land !!!

565
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:16,217
The original inhabitants.

566
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:18,282
Of course.

567
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:21,928
Unlike us.

568
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,398
Uprooted half and halfs,
imported intellectuals"

569
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:29,262
Actually

570
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:32,402
we cannot decide...

571
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:35,001
what comes first ?

572
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:36,405
People or theatre ?

573
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,571
Is PTG the party festoon ?

574
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:41,575
Yelling "people
people" all the time...

575
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:45,080
The theatre workers want
to concentrate on theatre Bhoba...

576
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,848
...not meetings, rallies and politics.

577
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:49,883
Why are they herded into regiments?

578
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,386
Here. -No.

579
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:54,055
Does anyone care about theater?

580
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:58,189
The lights, the sets, the acting.

581
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,060
Tea.

582
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:03,104
You cannot stage plays
without a revolving stage.

583
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:07,007
Not enough light, rundown sets"

584
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,872
...no theatre schooling,
the discipline is gone.

585
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:13,107
A good play has to look good. - No.

586
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:17,541
It must speak the truth.
- You're being impatient Bhoba.

587
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:22,881
Even anarchy has a discipline.
You lack that.

588
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:27,188
You're irregular. When you do come,
you're busy with your 'truth'!

589
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:28,386
Is that wrong ?

590
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:33,025
Truth is relative Bhoba.
Today's truth may be tomorrow's lie.

591
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:37,030
Think about the theatre.
It's the same for 'beauty' Shibuda.

592
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,304
I say it as we speak of theatre.

593
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:41,205
I can't do theatre for the sake of it.

594
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:42,972
I'm in for people's theatre.

595
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:47,115
But your mass plays,
your new fangled drivel, I'm not game.

596
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:51,251
Hence the new play at Srirangom
is selling so well and we're a flop.

597
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:54,015
Let it sell.
I'm not here to entertain people.

598
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:55,512
Moron!

599
00:46:56,013 --> 00:47:00,462
Be it true or beautiful, do we
have the ability to write a good play.'

600
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:03,498
The same old hash.
Brecht, Chekov, Ibsen.

601
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:10,403
You too are stuck at Shakespeare,
Anando. Try something original.

602
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:15,542
Thought of something new,
Bhoba? - Yes.

603
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:17,236
I've decided the name too.

604
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:20,105
Anguish. What's the theme?

605
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:22,141
Partition? Refugees?

606
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:23,711
That same old documentary
style of plays.

607
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:25,142
No.

608
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:29,349
Suicide. - What!

609
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:33,094
Why ? Why suicide? - Why not?

610
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,356
Head the papers those days ?

611
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,231
Ripples of suicide in Calcutta.

612
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:43,629
I was writing as the
Bengal Correspondent.

613
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:48,543
Thirty one suicides
in a city consecutively.

614
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:50,634
And the reason ?

615
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:52,638
Do you have suicidal ideation ?

616
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:54,009
Oh no!

617
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:58,746
Wasn't satisfied by just the article,
so I wrote an entire play.

618
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,189
It was turning into a good play.

619
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:06,284
Expressionist approach
much like Strindberg.

620
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:08,020
Stop these depressing stuff...

621
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:10,326
the audience will reject it.

622
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:12,198
In the morning...

623
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:16,464
was warming some borrowed
milk for the little one.

624
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:18,729
The rest...

625
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:22,276
...the rest hadn't
eaten since yesterday.

626
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:29,142
Suddenly Nutu, my third one..

627
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:32,682
...came and stood beside me.

628
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:36,256
He loves to eat, you know.

629
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:41,625
But we have never
afforded anything fancy.

630
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,626
He came before me, said...

631
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:48,259
"Ma.. I want to eat."

632
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:50,800
wicked boy...

633
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:52,738
gave him one whack...

634
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:57,202
next thing I know my Khuki screams...

635
00:48:57,534 --> 00:49:00,481
Ma, something is wrong with Nutu!

636
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:03,283
Something is wrong with Nutu!

637
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:07,755
Something is wrong with Nutu!

638
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:11,689
You are glorifying suicide!

639
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:15,295
You are behaving
like the Police chief.

640
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:18,631
Are you the secret mole of the Police?
Censoring?

641
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:21,826
Whatever we write will be questioned?
Is this a free country ?

642
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:25,130
That is how the British police
censored 'Nil Darpan' shows.

643
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:26,701
So what's new?

644
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:28,507
Bloody pimp-

645
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:30,807
Come on. Start.

646
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:39,143
I cried. I cried a lot.

647
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:46,421
Sat at my door and wailed..

648
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:52,833
"And wailed.

649
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,106
Is there anyone?

650
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:03,371
Anyone out there who
understands my tears ?

651
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:05,542
Is there anyone ?

652
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:07,815
Is there anyone ?

653
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:15,882
Is there anyone ?

654
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:18,859
...who'd understand those tears ?

655
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,595
Bloody scoundrels all...

656
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:30,227
You understood ? - Right ?

657
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:32,864
Because l was a people's artist...
that was my job.

658
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:39,647
The rest were just
the choicest bastards...

659
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,308
...plain mediocre or CIA's agents!

660
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:52,188
Think about it and tell me.
- About what?

661
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:54,489
Why did those news of
suicides move you so much ?

662
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,891
Because they were just the symptoms.

663
00:50:57,254 --> 00:51:00,394
I wanted to get to the root cause.
Like you.

664
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:02,692
Hmm...

665
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:05,332
That was? - Poverty, what else?

666
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:08,307
I was only recording
the great changes.

667
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:11,736
But the why did your
Party oppose you ?

668
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:14,942
Why could you not
finish your Gorky play ?

669
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:16,473
Why?

670
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:21,686
You left PTG. - Why?

671
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,956
There's no one with you today.
No friends, no one. Why.'

672
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:35,697
Because some looked for name,
fame, bank balance.

673
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:42,900
Some got depressed and looked
away and some went down fighting.

674
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:44,935
Hence.

675
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:50,343
But I..

676
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:53,615
...was smelling the
gunfire on the streets!

677
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:05,230
"We have no language...
no homeland..."

678
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:07,825
All thrown out of their own country.

679
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:15,836
"We have no destination...
no homeland..."

680
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:19,243
Grabbing our land now!

681
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,446
There is no good, There is no evil.

682
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:28,949
No kith nor kin.

683
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:31,955
Who says to slay is sinning ?

684
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,723
When this world is a
giant Carnival of killing,

685
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:40,292
Killing in the woods, Killing
in the huts, Killing in bird nests,

686
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,893
Killing in worm burrows,
Killing in vast oceans"

687
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,301
Killing in azure skies,

688
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:47,305
Killing to survive, Killing for play,

689
00:52:47,397 --> 00:52:50,503
Killing for no reason,
Killing unintended...

690
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:53,372
What are you thinking ?

691
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:56,976
Many things...

692
00:52:57,707 --> 00:52:59,277
lam unable to tie up the ends.

693
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,686
Theatre or films ?

694
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:03,557
Within the party or outside?

695
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:07,953
I being unable to
settle down anywhere.

696
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:10,789
You are being chased
by your flight of thoughts.

697
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:15,994
They never let you
be and that's what I fear.

698
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:18,703
A demonic criminality.

699
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:20,399
A strange madness.

700
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:22,475
What kind of madness?

701
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:25,912
Have you read about the
Greek legend of Sisyphus ?

702
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:29,083
King Sisyphus was
punished by the Gods,

703
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,546
to bear stones all his life.

704
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:35,748
So that his enormous strength,
may slowly ebb.

705
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:38,793
Because that was what he needed.

706
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:42,758
His strength made
those around him weak.

707
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:45,989
You must chastise yourself.

708
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,335
You must control yourself Bhoba.

709
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,531
You must simmer down your smoulder.

710
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:54,340
Or else all...

711
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:56,535
will be,

712
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:59,369
scorched around you.

713
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,786
What's happened ?

714
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,357
The Plays a hit!

715
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:11,951
But Bhoba,

716
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:16,091
all your broad big,
exaggerated gestures keep coming back.

717
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:19,458
It's all like only
your body is acting, false.

718
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:22,426
But that is what the
audience is lapping up.

719
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:23,560
Maybe because in this play"

720
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:25,639
"Raghupati needs to be
played with a superficial touch.

721
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:27,564
What are you thinking ?

722
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:28,899
Thinking.

723
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,643
How I have begged,
borrowed and stolen for a few shows.

724
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,779
It is so pointless.
How many people have seen them?

725
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:42,652
How much can you tell with so little ?

726
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,584
Have you seen De
Sica's Bicycle Thieves ?

727
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,529
Animesh ...explain it to Bhoba.

728
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:52,827
Listen...

729
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:56,529
Because you do it yourself you
don't feel the pressure for profits.

730
00:54:56,893 --> 00:54:58,600
Had a producer been breathing
down your necks...

731
00:54:58,828 --> 00:54:59,966
Correct.
- But Cinema ?

732
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:03,473
I know! How long have
you been around?

733
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:05,637
Huh !Think about
the sheer numbers!

734
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:09,515
Theatre provokes an immediate
reaction but that is inadequate.

735
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:13,480
And why are we looking at films
as money making machines ?

736
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:19,188
I am fed up of my job as
a medical representative.

737
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:23,029
There is a reason why
I am tense.

738
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:26,199
Eisenstein, Pudovkin...

739
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:29,102
had access to government funds
at a point of time.

740
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:33,173
The rest like Chaplin, De Sica
had a problem with funds.

741
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,034
Take my example.

742
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:36,876
How much do I earn
as an editor ?

743
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,740
We can all pitch in,
we are the producers.

744
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:41,905
Brilliant!
- As in?

745
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,576
Is this a joke ?

746
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,678
Bikram da l have not
fallen in love with films.

747
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:51,457
It is just a weapon
for me.

748
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:56,464
And tomorrow...
if you get a sharper sword ?

749
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:57,961
Will kick aside movies
and go forward.

750
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:09,042
Have you thought Bhoba,
what you will work upon?

751
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:17,741
I know him.

752
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:20,114
I had seen him.

753
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:23,515
Still stands the huge city,

754
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:27,152
it's sky scrapped by
a jungle of black wires.

755
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:29,757
I had seen him under that sky.

756
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,500
In a crowd of thousands
of city dwellers...

757
00:56:33,256 --> 00:56:34,667
...another city dweller.

758
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:46,143
How long will your work deal
with migrants and refugees ?

759
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,205
As long as I can.

760
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:51,050
Because I don't believe
in these very terms.

761
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:55,518
Stop labeling people!
- But no one saw all that.

762
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:58,253
But that does not prove there is no
hardship and sorrow in the world.

763
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:08,534
And what about us ?

764
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:14,137
You've begged and borrowed
to make the film.

765
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:15,872
But you couldn't release it.

766
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,708
There are others
making movies too.

767
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:24,979
They're being shown around the
world, getting acknowledgments.

768
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:27,748
And you, going
around like a Vagabond.

769
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:35,621
There is no money in the house.

770
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:46,965
Money won't remain Dugga.

771
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:50,570
But my work will.

772
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:52,771
You'll see.

773
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,140
Your wife has a complaint...

774
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,017
...you are very whimsical...

775
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,348
Which do you prefer Doctor,

776
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:06,259
a slushy pond or...

777
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,352
a gushing mountain stream ?

778
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:12,590
I wouldn't have been able to
to lead the life of a school teacher.

779
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,597
Therefore...

780
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:17,067
...from poetry to prose
to theatre to films.

781
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:23,677
I had a lot to say.

782
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:27,014
This is not me.
This is Maxim Gorky.

783
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:30,775
Dinonath has just translated it
why will we have to justify this ?

784
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:32,376
Nobody wants to
believe you Bhoba.

785
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:34,087
Maybe not today but tomorrow.

786
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:36,851
You all are there, the party is there.
- Where is the party?

787
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:40,751
The party has dropped you Bhoba.
- What!

788
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:44,330
They say you, Mohit
and Anando...

789
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:46,124
You are

790
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:48,060
Trotskyte...Anarchists...

791
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:49,959
Bastards !!!

792
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:53,298
They've also been wary about
my relationship with Nilkantha.

793
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:57,706
But Aslam and I...

794
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:02,314
have already sent our justification
about the cultural front.

795
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,649
What happened to that?

796
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:07,850
That's also missing.

797
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:10,914
What!!!
- That is the problem!

798
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:14,193
There is a one-man commission
on our new play.

799
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:17,330
Comrade Basu had written a letter
protesting on our behalf...

800
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,894
...but... that too is missing.
Perfect!

801
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,998
So.. we then cannot remain
in group theatre anymore.

802
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:29,272
Even if I am not here...

803
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:32,272
...peoples theatre will remain in me.

804
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:39,814
Feeling very tired Doctor...

805
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:41,148
am off to bed.

806
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:44,122
You are one stubborn man.

807
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:48,353
You must take your
medicines regularly

808
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,198
Might make you drowsy...
- May I come in?

809
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:54,926
Need to talk.

810
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:56,731
About what ?

811
00:59:56,826 --> 00:59:59,204
It is a new dawn in Asia.

812
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:01,736
These are a few sunrays.

813
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:04,778
Again at your nonsense ?
- Without booze !

814
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,369
Or, I'd abuse too.

815
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:07,777
Please leave.

816
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:09,876
We have work.

817
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:13,214
Work? Jobless idiots!

818
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:14,880
We have information...

819
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:16,815
Ashim Mahato...

820
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:18,758
of Gopiballavpur...

821
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:20,989
...is admitted here under
an assumed name.

822
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:23,760
Conspiring against the
state; that's the charge.

823
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:25,325
We have an eye witness.

824
01:00:26,255 --> 01:00:27,325
What can I do ?

825
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:29,061
We have permission...

826
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:31,436
...from the authorities.

827
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:34,236
We have a search warrant.

828
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:36,240
Identification parade.

829
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,204
Impossible...

830
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:39,838
This is insane...

831
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:12,938
Come Phulmoni! - Nothing will happen.

832
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:15,448
Nothing will happen, come.
- Nothing will happen.

833
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:17,518
Don't be scared.

834
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:21,186
Phulmoni, listen to me!
Stand here.

835
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:24,185
Catch her.

836
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:27,987
What's happened ?

837
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:29,355
Identify?

838
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:31,327
I can't find him Sir...

839
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:33,567
Try to remember who
you had seen!

840
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:35,363
It was a ghost!

841
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:39,265
All states are prone to imagining
ghosts of their traitors.

842
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,500
Shut up you nut head!

843
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:42,943
This one's the worst of
all the lunatics here!

844
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,505
Bastard !

845
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:33,111
Who's that?
- Ramu, from the colony.

846
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:35,355
The hero of many
of your films.

847
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:37,956
That 'city dweller'
hero of yours.

848
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:41,389
The film never got released.
No one ever saw it.

849
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:43,389
I know...

850
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:44,994
Anyway-

851
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,590
Where have you been
all these days?

852
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:50,364
We all live in
No man's land Nil da.

853
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:52,231
Do we have an address ?

854
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:54,403
Right.

855
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:59,072
I too am a refugee now.

856
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:03,949
No country, no group,
no friends, no family.

857
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,952
Just a drifter...
a vagabond.

858
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:12,026
But we will still
give birth Nil da.

859
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:14,094
We will writhe in pain.

860
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,019
And through that pain...

861
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:17,597
...will be delivered new life...

862
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:19,457
Not my lines.

863
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:21,190
Yours.

864
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:22,727
Remember?

865
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:26,231
Bloody!

866
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:32,239
Havel ever deceived
in my world of thoughts ?

867
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:10,444
Oh no!

868
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:13,111
Police raid sir.

869
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:15,113
Narayan .

870
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:31,729
One of them has been
arrested from Debra.

871
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:34,740
Take him in custody today.
We'll take him to the court day after.

872
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:36,704
And in the middle of that...

873
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:43,742
Sir...

874
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:45,545
...road map sir.

875
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:49,686
They had an assassination plan.

876
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:52,126
The target was the police chief Manna.

877
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:56,156
And all you people can see
is state violence, Mr.Bagchi.

878
01:05:56,752 --> 01:05:59,232
When power speaks so
shall the rebel.

879
01:05:59,755 --> 01:06:02,133
If there's a state there
will be conspirators!

880
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:05,663
Come on!

881
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:08,367
You bloody pimps
of China!

882
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:10,541
Narayan!

883
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:14,680
Damini! Damini, calm down.

884
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:17,345
Hey!

885
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:19,549
Damini, be quiet. What are you doing?

886
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:25,387
...we need to talk.

887
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:31,554
Tell me.

888
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,155
Be seated.

889
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,369
After all the medication and therapy"

890
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:38,097
...we've come to a decision about you.

891
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:39,602
That this bugger is a
complete scoundrel.

892
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,508
He can never ever change.

893
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:44,737
“Ism?

894
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:51,147
Your alcoholism, exasperation,
all of this has one root cause.

895
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:54,615
Depression.

896
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:02,229
We have to make you survive,
you're a creative person.

897
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:05,394
These aren't my words
but society's demand.

898
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:07,861
Is the society high on booze?

899
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:10,635
Why so much compassion
in such evil times?

900
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,732
The dosage which you were
given can't be increased.

901
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:17,139
There is toxicity involved.

902
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:24,140
You drank again?

903
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:27,277
I did.

904
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:30,156
I mean couldn't control so...

905
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:33,182
Hence?

906
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:38,857
We have to go for ECT.

907
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:42,628
As in?

908
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:45,361
Electro Convulsive Therapy...

909
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:47,941
...popularly known
as shock treatment.

910
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:53,373
Oh ! Which is a treament
I usually practice on others.

911
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,611
We will be taking all precautions.

912
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:02,678
But Ma'am, before that you
need to sign the risk bond.

913
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:05,948
Madam .

914
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:08,953
Please.

915
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:13,461
1905.

916
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:15,927
The first partition of Bengal, Doctor.

917
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:21,536
Us, Bengalis, who've suffered
so much since then...

918
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:25,305
...can't be hurt further more...

919
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:28,744
...by this new fangled
Western treatment of yours.

920
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:31,309
Com e.

921
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:34,251
Let's go for a walk?

922
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:36,412
Come on.

923
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,713
Open your mouth sir.

924
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:04,473
A little wider.

925
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:07,714
Okay.

926
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:09,651
Heady sister?
- Yes sir.

927
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:21,966
Surge, swell
Oh! mighty waves"

928
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:24,663
Smash, shatter
as shackles do break...

929
01:09:24,894 --> 01:09:30,037
Yonder, a new dawn peeps
as souls arise so long asleep.

930
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,753
Surge, swell
Oh! mighty waves"

931
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,790
Smash, shatter
as shackles do break...

932
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:49,591
Yonder, a new dawn peeps
as souls arise so long asleep.

933
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:52,494
Surge, swell
Oh! mighty waves"

934
01:09:52,588 --> 01:09:55,296
Smash, shatter
as shackles do break...

935
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:58,304
surge, swell
Oh! mighty waves"

936
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,341
Smash, shatter
as shackles do break...

937
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:53,551
Now try to sit up slowly.

938
01:10:55,784 --> 01:10:56,922
Come on.

939
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:04,427
So?

940
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:06,368
You need to get better.

941
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,704
You'll have to start
writing again, right?

942
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:21,510
My glasses? -Yes.

943
01:11:32,988 --> 01:11:35,594
I have finished writing Doctor.

944
01:11:47,503 --> 01:11:49,005
It's a new play.

945
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:56,582
Surge, swell Oh! mighty waves"

946
01:11:56,679 --> 01:11:58,022
Now the rehearsals.

947
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:02,757
Smash, shatter as shackles do break...

948
01:12:02,885 --> 01:12:05,764
surge, swell Oh! mighty waves"

949
01:12:05,888 --> 01:12:09,461
Smash, shatter as shackles do break...

950
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:17,574
How are you doing today ?

951
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:20,445
Broken..

952
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:22,206
...but...

953
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:23,575
...not beaten.

954
01:12:23,706 --> 01:12:25,982
Head the play ? - Yes I did.

955
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,781
Why suddenly mental patients ?

956
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:31,548
Who is not a mental patient, Dugga ?

957
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:33,185
Is everyone sane ?

958
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:39,724
So Doctor, don't you get
government funds for this place?

959
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:41,624
We do.

960
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:43,067
Cultural development fund.

961
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:48,071
Will you be able to
Manage with this health ?

962
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:50,142
And that too with the inmates ?

963
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:55,910
You still have a few
more ECTs to go through.

964
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:04,580
How many volts per cycle Doctor ?

965
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:06,988
About volts.

966
01:13:14,523 --> 01:13:20,599
A thousand volts play around
in this brain of mine Doctor.

967
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:25,739
Your therapy tickles me.

968
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:30,944
May I? - Please start.

969
01:13:31,273 --> 01:13:35,744
We... plan to stage
a play in this hospital.

970
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:38,120
Here you go, Jack.

971
01:13:39,648 --> 01:13:43,755
Ace! Its all mine. - How come?

972
01:13:46,722 --> 01:13:47,996
This one..

973
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:52,069
Leave it. - Silence please.
Mr.Bagchi is saying something.

974
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:59,938
We all, live in the
heart of this city.

975
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:02,878
But we are all refugees...

976
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:05,016
You don't know much. - I know..

977
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:07,553
...on the fringes of society.
Marginalized.

978
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:09,546
I did right.

979
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:13,293
Can we never get
back to the mainstream ?

980
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:16,858
See what he did ? - Amalesh!
Aren't you supposed to give the cards?

981
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:23,561
We know our pluses and minuses,
our notoriety.

982
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:26,172
Is this right?
- Shut up. I'm not playing.

983
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:28,798
But shall we be defeated ?
- What is this Amalesh!

984
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,637
Kartik da.
- You are creating all problem.

985
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:36,274
Kartik da!

986
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:38,109
Where are you off to?

987
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:42,279
Tridib! - Where are you off to?
- If not today then someday.

988
01:14:42,377 --> 01:14:43,651
We will not be defeated!

989
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:45,320
We can do it.

990
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:50,790
We will prove it that we
still stand by the working class.

991
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:54,595
Damini! - Silence.

992
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:58,204
Mr. Bagchi!

993
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:04,803
Silence.

994
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:12,916
Shanti visualizes these
grills as slithering snakes.

995
01:15:13,742 --> 01:15:16,655
And this huge lock...
the face of Goddess Kali.

996
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:18,353
Her tongue sticking out.

997
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:22,156
Stop laughing-

998
01:15:22,918 --> 01:15:26,024
Why are you laughing like a lunatic?
- Once the delusion fades...

999
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:28,827
...Shanti becomes
the soul of my Bengal.

1000
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:31,168
The slayer of all evils.

1001
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:34,230
And then the celebration of
the Mother Goddess, her tempest dance.

1002
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:37,836
Phulmoni? Phulmoni will dance.

1003
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:39,276
Our Phulmoni? - Yes.

1004
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,348
Impossible!
She won't be able to do it.

1005
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:44,917
Mr. Bagchi.

1006
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:47,214
Yes? - You will have
to come with me once.

1007
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:49,786
Sorry. I had to stop you.

1008
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:54,955
Sorry?

1009
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,328
Okay, let's go. - Come.

1010
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:16,935
Dad.. - Who is it?

1011
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:20,809
Ramakanta again?

1012
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:25,017
No, I'm Shubho,
from your film, 'Runaway'.

1013
01:17:25,107 --> 01:17:26,950
I've run away from home.

1014
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:30,512
Here, Keshto uncle's Gram Fritters,
want some?

1015
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:36,485
Let's run away Bhoba.

1016
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:40,159
Where to?
- To the bank of the Padma river.

1017
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:41,359
Pabna.

1018
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:44,529
No, I'm not coming along.

1019
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:47,767
Don't you know I'm being
treated with shock therapy?

1020
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:48,933
I know.

1021
01:17:50,065 --> 01:17:54,013
I am too weak to walk.
- I have brought us a car.

1022
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:55,408
Want to see it?

1023
01:17:57,039 --> 01:17:58,416
What are you saying!

1024
01:18:00,809 --> 01:18:01,879
Car!

1025
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:10,888
There, the master is standing,
Parimal, the loony. Come on.

1026
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:17,528
Master, he will go to Pabna. - When?

1027
01:18:17,826 --> 01:18:18,896
Right now.

1028
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:21,365
Twenty.

1029
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:26,813
Making a kill as we are in a spot?
We won't go, won't see Pabna.

1030
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:30,812
Okay fine.

1031
01:18:32,007 --> 01:18:33,509
We'll give you twenty rupees.
Let's go.

1032
01:18:34,509 --> 01:18:35,988
Let's go Jagaddal.

1033
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:46,828
The flower of pearl,
the flower of pearl!

1034
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:48,833
It is very far!

1035
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:53,997
Your son sent flowers
from the banana plant,

1036
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:59,438
The trees have borne fruits.

1037
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:00,569
Let's go.

1038
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:05,246
Let's leave the roads,
let's go to the river.

1039
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:14,424
Hurry, hurry!
- Hey you! Hey ! You stole my boat.

1040
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:17,191
You've set it afloat.

1041
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:21,332
You scoundrels! Hey!

1042
01:19:33,902 --> 01:19:35,609
Parimal Master !

1043
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:40,618
No he's our Fritters man, Krishnadas.

1044
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:45,890
What happened to you?

1045
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:58,396
Someone's home.
They set it ablaze in the '46 riots

1046
01:19:58,493 --> 01:20:02,168
We are a nation with our own
distinctive culture and civilization,

1047
01:20:02,564 --> 01:20:06,102
"We have no language.."

1048
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:09,045
"We have no homeland.."

1049
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:16,913
"We have no direction.."

1050
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:20,491
"We have no homeland.."

1051
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:24,029
"We have no direction.."

1052
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:28,067
"We have no homeland.."

1053
01:20:28,957 --> 01:20:31,631
I propose a two nation theory.

1054
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:36,431
Bhoba! - Hey, it's you Ratan!

1055
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:41,140
Where's Gita, your friend?
Uncle Jagadish's sister?

1056
01:20:41,403 --> 01:20:42,473
She went missing.

1057
01:20:43,071 --> 01:20:44,209
During the riot.

1058
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:46,448
It's her I've been Looking for.

1059
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:50,982
Bagdibou Koikeyi,
my mother, all have gone missing.

1060
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:53,991
Can you help me find my mother Bhoba?

1061
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:55,449
Come on.

1062
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:55,689
Come on.

1063
01:20:57,686 --> 01:21:02,192
My prayers remain unfinished.

1064
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:05,596
My prayers remain unfinished.

1065
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:11,575
I could not say my prayers.

1066
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:16,206
I could not say my prayers.

1067
01:21:16,638 --> 01:21:24,079
My prayers remain unfinished.
I could not say my prayers.

1068
01:21:24,579 --> 01:21:27,992
My prayers remain unfinished.

1069
01:21:29,017 --> 01:21:31,054
Know the name of the river, Bhoba ?

1070
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:33,056
Subarnorekha!

1071
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:36,302
Gita.. you !

1072
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:43,704
Yonder is the station"

1073
01:21:43,798 --> 01:21:48,076
...there sits Jagadish da with
the station master, let's go see.

1074
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:50,013
Come on.

1075
01:21:54,309 --> 01:21:58,155
Jagadish, the Dwandakaryonno Express
just left packed with refugees.

1076
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:00,487
All from East Bengal, they
dumped two aged women from the train.

1077
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:02,562
Ok. - One is dying.

1078
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:07,031
I believe they are from Bikrampur,
from your village, Kheyadaho.

1079
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:08,658
Oh is it. - Yes, last stage.

1080
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:11,761
Even the Medical Officer failed.
There's no hope.

1081
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:13,334
Bagdibou!

1082
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:18,205
Bagdibou!

1083
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:23,773
What's wrong?
- A low caste woman is dying.

1084
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:26,312
My mother!

1085
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:38,157
Bagdibou!

1086
01:22:40,221 --> 01:22:43,600
"We have no language.."

1087
01:22:43,658 --> 01:22:47,936
"We have no homeland.."

1088
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:54,375
"We have no direction.."

1089
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:57,939
"We have no homeland.."

1090
01:22:58,039 --> 01:23:01,509
"We have no direction.."

1091
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:04,954
"We have no homeland.."

1092
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:08,619
Only a few more days.
I know it's tiring you but...

1093
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:10,060
"this time it's a long term plan.

1094
01:23:13,254 --> 01:23:16,463
A short circuit has happened
in the metre box Doctor.

1095
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:19,197
Will there be light ever again?

1096
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:23,232
Your integrity, motivation..
has all that vanished?

1097
01:23:23,631 --> 01:23:25,577
Did I ever possess those?

1098
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:29,512
Or was all of it only...

1099
01:23:30,638 --> 01:23:31,742
...defence?

1100
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:36,450
"Wherefore rejoice...

1101
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,590
...what conquest brings he home...

1102
01:23:42,183 --> 01:23:45,221
...what tributaries
follow him to Home"

1103
01:23:46,154 --> 01:23:48,259
in captive bonds of cha..

1104
01:23:49,724 --> 01:23:50,998
Sorry.

1105
01:23:53,428 --> 01:23:55,101
How are you Bikram da?

1106
01:23:56,798 --> 01:23:58,038
I'm good.

1107
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:00,672
How've you been?

1108
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:04,672
Walking the red carpet everyday.

1109
01:24:05,306 --> 01:24:07,343
From one country
liquor shop to another.

1110
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:14,692
Everybody's films flop Bhoba.
- How many films?

1111
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:17,688
How many?

1112
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:24,601
"Pain"

1113
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:30,800
A car and it's driver.

1114
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:34,213
A story about their simple love.

1115
01:24:36,137 --> 01:24:37,548
No one understood!

1116
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:41,612
Children's literature.
A kid who ran away from home.

1117
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:44,317
No one bothered to see it!

1118
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:50,524
How long shall I hear
the echoes of my own...

1119
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:53,497
"tiring screams in my own dreams?

1120
01:24:53,688 --> 01:24:54,792
Could you tell me?

1121
01:24:58,359 --> 01:25:00,305
So then you will give up Bhoba?

1122
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:06,075
Don't you have any contribution
in this fate of yours?

1123
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:08,745
You mean I didn't try'?
- You weren't consistent.

1124
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:11,682
Your first Hindi story won awards

1125
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:14,778
You quit the job in Filmistan
to join theatre here.

1126
01:25:14,876 --> 01:25:16,787
You started off with the play
but you didn't finish it. - Fimistan!

1127
01:25:17,178 --> 01:25:19,351
You wrote scripts, left them to rot.

1128
01:25:20,248 --> 01:25:23,593
The shoot started but didn't finish.
Are you decisive at all?

1129
01:25:27,722 --> 01:25:29,861
You're displeasing everyone Bhoba.

1130
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:32,366
Friends.

1131
01:25:33,695 --> 01:25:34,867
Producers.

1132
01:25:36,898 --> 01:25:38,434
Governmental offices.

1133
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:41,580
Newspaper offices.

1134
01:25:42,437 --> 01:25:43,609
Even family.

1135
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:48,219
You know why?

1136
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:53,626
My pen and I are one and the same.

1137
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,230
What are you thinking?

1138
01:26:09,764 --> 01:26:11,243
About Rabindranath Tagore.

1139
01:26:13,902 --> 01:26:16,712
He's written so much,
thought about so much.

1140
01:26:18,406 --> 01:26:19,908
He is so enlightened.

1141
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:25,152
Dugga"

1142
01:26:27,882 --> 01:26:32,422
...why did he write
that Poem all of a sudden?

1143
01:26:34,822 --> 01:26:38,269
Death, you're equal to my nights.

1144
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:42,568
I don't know.

1145
01:26:44,899 --> 01:26:46,810
Will I finally lose?

1146
01:26:48,503 --> 01:26:49,743
Will l flee?

1147
01:26:52,674 --> 01:26:53,709
Traitor?

1148
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:02,251
What nonsense are you speaking?

1149
01:27:05,653 --> 01:27:07,326
I feel really angry at times.

1150
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:10,801
I feel like finishing myself off.

1151
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:38,526
The epic character
Karna(in Mahabharata)"

1152
01:27:38,653 --> 01:27:39,825
...was born with innate truth.

1153
01:27:40,488 --> 01:27:43,560
And you ?
You were born with innate purity.

1154
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:47,398
I'm not flattering you.
Just analysing.

1155
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:14,790
Over days, the way I feel
about nature, is changing.

1156
01:28:16,891 --> 01:28:20,998
Earlier I was prone to feeling
it from the depth of my heart.

1157
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:25,771
And now, all I'm interested
in is how to steal it's beauty.

1158
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:32,046
You're like the Autumn.

1159
01:28:32,707 --> 01:28:36,780
Always childlike but always serious.

1160
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:53,632
The girls here are very simple.
They have a natural rhythm in them.

1161
01:28:54,629 --> 01:28:59,009
Whenever I see them,
they remind me of you.

1162
01:28:59,734 --> 01:29:04,808
It's this simplicity of yours that
has still held our household together.

1163
01:29:09,811 --> 01:29:12,553
Love. Nilkantha.

1164
01:29:45,413 --> 01:29:46,756
Let's say...

1165
01:29:47,615 --> 01:29:50,994
...this is a mental hospital ward.

1166
01:29:52,086 --> 01:29:57,092
This is the first time we
get to know about Shanti's illness.

1167
01:29:58,693 --> 01:29:59,865
Damini, ready'?

1168
01:30:02,029 --> 01:30:05,010
Where's Kartik? Kartik.

1169
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:10,981
Hey Kartik!
- Here Mr. Bagchi. Make up?

1170
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:12,811
Hey!

1171
01:30:13,107 --> 01:30:14,450
Quiet!

1172
01:30:16,644 --> 01:30:21,491
You're Shanti's husband who is ill.
Your factory has been locked down.

1173
01:30:22,817 --> 01:30:25,058
Kidding me here,
with that kerchief around your neck?

1174
01:30:26,053 --> 01:30:29,432
It's my habit from childhood.
I stay a bit neat and clean.

1175
01:30:29,524 --> 01:30:34,530
Shut up! Pick up the habits of
your character shedding of your own!

1176
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:44,445
Come on. - Come on, Shanti.

1177
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:46,485
Where are you taking me? I won't go.

1178
01:30:46,574 --> 01:30:50,750
Come out Shanti. - Leave me!

1179
01:30:52,046 --> 01:30:53,957
Sir. Shanti...

1180
01:30:54,215 --> 01:30:55,660
She will die.

1181
01:30:56,017 --> 01:30:58,429
Nothing will happen,
this is just a play.

1182
01:30:58,653 --> 01:31:00,098
It's all a set up. Fake.

1183
01:31:00,755 --> 01:31:02,132
It's fake? -Yes.

1184
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:03,492
It's fake?

1185
01:31:03,591 --> 01:31:06,128
Oh no! Blood!

1186
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:09,007
My head is bleeding!

1187
01:31:09,096 --> 01:31:12,600
No, that’s not blood.
That's your vermillion.

1188
01:31:13,067 --> 01:31:14,478
Vermillion!

1189
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:17,977
But that's something
Indian married women wear.

1190
01:31:18,506 --> 01:31:20,577
Will you burn me to death?

1191
01:31:22,076 --> 01:31:23,646
Amalesh!

1192
01:31:23,711 --> 01:31:26,055
Get lost!

1193
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:28,791
Get lost!

1194
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:30,722
Com e.

1195
01:31:30,952 --> 01:31:35,128
Let's go sit in that chair.

1196
01:31:36,524 --> 01:31:37,628
Who are you?

1197
01:31:39,627 --> 01:31:42,107
I? I'm your friend.

1198
01:31:42,697 --> 01:31:44,768
Friend? - Yes.

1199
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,481
You're really a friend? - Hmm.

1200
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:53,486
Son, what is the character?

1201
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:55,482
A Doctor.

1202
01:31:57,044 --> 01:31:58,819
There should be an integrity.

1203
01:31:59,747 --> 01:32:01,886
You should look upright and confident.

1204
01:32:01,983 --> 01:32:05,795
Look at our Doctor.
You're constantly stammering.

1205
01:32:06,087 --> 01:32:08,567
Does a psychiatrist wear an apron?

1206
01:32:09,824 --> 01:32:13,795
Do you have to make him wear
an apron to prove he is a doctor?

1207
01:32:14,228 --> 01:32:16,037
Yes, that I have to.

1208
01:32:17,164 --> 01:32:21,237
I want to see an archetypal doctor
Ramen da. Even though it's unreal.

1209
01:32:21,836 --> 01:32:25,716
Because that's what people think,
that's how they recognise a doctor.

1210
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,947
The people are the priority.

1211
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:36,927
Your health has deteriorated.

1212
01:32:38,152 --> 01:32:39,290
Leave that.

1213
01:32:40,788 --> 01:32:42,768
What news of the party?

1214
01:32:44,592 --> 01:32:45,730
Forget it.

1215
01:32:47,194 --> 01:32:49,936
You already know,
everything has shattered.

1216
01:32:51,632 --> 01:32:53,168
On one side there's
too much compromise.

1217
01:32:54,635 --> 01:32:55,841
A part of the group is preaching"

1218
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:57,574
...co-existence participating
in the government.

1219
01:32:58,973 --> 01:33:02,284
And the other side is
living on the edge. Terrorism.

1220
01:33:02,843 --> 01:33:04,322
Corner the city with villages!

1221
01:33:05,012 --> 01:33:07,891
Will you stop dwelling on
this same question again and again?

1222
01:33:08,349 --> 01:33:09,589
Ramen da.

1223
01:33:10,718 --> 01:33:11,856
Will you please sleep a bit?

1224
01:33:14,689 --> 01:33:15,793
Sleep?

1225
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:21,563
Did I take birth to sleep Dugga?

1226
01:33:30,037 --> 01:33:31,243
Why art suddenly?

1227
01:33:32,807 --> 01:33:34,184
For the betterment of the mass.

1228
01:33:39,714 --> 01:33:42,251
This is where Russians are correct.

1229
01:33:43,384 --> 01:33:44,988
That's what I felt after meeting them.

1230
01:33:46,153 --> 01:33:48,360
The artists of our country
don't know their country well.

1231
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:51,194
Whose betterment
will they think about?

1232
01:33:52,927 --> 01:33:54,065
You're right.

1233
01:33:54,695 --> 01:33:59,769
Only Mr.Arijit Hay. His 'Pather Gaan',
'Aparajeo, marvelous.

1234
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:06,642
Let's see if he can keep it up.

1235
01:34:06,741 --> 01:34:10,814
Thank God he got awards abroad,
otherwise...

1236
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:16,089
Here, gulp it down.
- No, I can't take the smell.

1237
01:34:17,918 --> 01:34:21,832
The intermediate stage between
capitalism and socialism is...

1238
01:34:23,858 --> 01:34:25,303
...alcoholism, Bagchi.

1239
01:34:26,427 --> 01:34:31,206
Here take it. The last shelter
of the intellect. Drink it down.

1240
01:34:38,339 --> 01:34:39,409
Scoundrel!

1241
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,252
If I ever touch this thing again!

1242
01:34:51,085 --> 01:34:52,359
I have information...

1243
01:34:53,854 --> 01:34:55,959
...some of our unit members
drink behind our back.

1244
01:34:56,691 --> 01:34:58,136
Why.' What is their problem?

1245
01:35:01,328 --> 01:35:02,932
To endure the hardships of life?

1246
01:35:04,298 --> 01:35:07,768
And here we're trying to
build a group of activist artists.

1247
01:35:10,137 --> 01:35:13,778
From tomorrow no one shall touch
alcohol in the shoot or the edit.

1248
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:20,814
Let's see.

1249
01:35:20,815 --> 01:35:20,849
Let's see.

1250
01:35:44,505 --> 01:35:48,112
"I am in love."

1251
01:35:54,982 --> 01:35:58,361
"I am in love."

1252
01:36:05,259 --> 01:36:10,402
"I am in love."

1253
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:15,737
"With my beloved."

1254
01:36:15,803 --> 01:36:19,012
"I am in love."

1255
01:36:21,509 --> 01:36:29,087
"I am in love."

1256
01:36:30,484 --> 01:36:35,433
"The reflection of
my beloved is wonderful."

1257
01:36:35,523 --> 01:36:40,996
"The reflection of
my beloved is wonderful."

1258
01:36:41,095 --> 01:36:46,773
"I am greedy seeing it."

1259
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:50,111
"I am in love."

1260
01:36:51,071 --> 01:36:57,215
"I am in love."

1261
01:36:57,311 --> 01:37:00,815
"I am in love."

1262
01:37:04,952 --> 01:37:06,932
Ma, brother is home.

1263
01:37:07,988 --> 01:37:11,526
I told you not too
but you still came late.

1264
01:37:13,327 --> 01:37:14,397
Where is Khuki Ma?

1265
01:37:14,895 --> 01:37:16,841
She is my elder daughter.

1266
01:37:18,165 --> 01:37:20,441
She has supported everyone.

1267
01:37:21,402 --> 01:37:23,006
She is untouchable.

1268
01:37:29,610 --> 01:37:31,988
So have you fallen
in love at such a ripe age?

1269
01:37:32,079 --> 01:37:34,992
What are you hiding?
Love letter? Let me see!

1270
01:37:40,421 --> 01:37:42,924
"I am in love."

1271
01:37:43,023 --> 01:37:45,435
What happened Dada?
Why are you so restless?

1272
01:37:45,626 --> 01:37:48,573
Khuki has got T.B. Terminal stage.

1273
01:37:48,963 --> 01:37:51,102
She's been ill for so long,
none of you understood?

1274
01:37:51,398 --> 01:37:53,002
What not has she done for us!

1275
01:37:53,167 --> 01:37:55,977
I accuse. - Whom?

1276
01:37:58,939 --> 01:38:00,009
No one.

1277
01:38:02,142 --> 01:38:03,450
No one at all.

1278
01:38:04,445 --> 01:38:05,856
Cut.

1279
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:15,862
Aunt, where's the tea?
- Good news Boudi.

1280
01:38:15,923 --> 01:38:18,426
'Beyond Clouds' has set
the market on fire! Here see.

1281
01:38:18,525 --> 01:38:21,404
Yes, I've heard.
- But didn't you guys say...

1282
01:38:21,929 --> 01:38:24,500
...it's too sentimental. Won't work.

1283
01:38:24,932 --> 01:38:28,277
Mr. Bagchi's new film 'Beyond
Clouds' fills our heart...

1284
01:38:28,335 --> 01:38:31,373
...up with compassionate
colours of life.

1285
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:33,010
Nice, see what the poet.

1286
01:38:33,107 --> 01:38:34,643
"Krishna Sen has to say. - Yes.

1287
01:38:35,175 --> 01:38:37,883
"This is what the masters
call the personification of tragedy".

1288
01:38:41,015 --> 01:38:42,050
Anyway-

1289
01:38:42,416 --> 01:38:45,226
May be this tragedy
shall wash away our tragedy.

1290
01:38:52,059 --> 01:38:53,436
That could have been
the turning point.

1291
01:38:57,431 --> 01:38:59,536
That was the only time I passed.

1292
01:39:00,968 --> 01:39:05,542
You could say,
the great mother archetype had worked.

1293
01:39:08,075 --> 01:39:09,918
After that I failed miserably.

1294
01:39:10,544 --> 01:39:12,421
Why? Why do you say you failed?

1295
01:39:13,614 --> 01:39:16,185
Have you heard the song,
'Don't swing with the spring'?

1296
01:39:17,384 --> 01:39:18,454
Yes I have.

1297
01:39:18,686 --> 01:39:19,926
Very nice song.

1298
01:39:20,654 --> 01:39:22,531
'What if this path
never ends?' this song?

1299
01:39:23,057 --> 01:39:25,094
Yes. I've seen that film too.

1300
01:39:25,559 --> 01:39:29,029
A very favorite film of mine. Bengal's
favorite pair starred in it after all.

1301
01:39:30,664 --> 01:39:33,543
At that time a couple of my
films released too, did you see them?

1302
01:39:35,302 --> 01:39:40,149
Partition, people residing
in colonies, these were the subjects.

1303
01:39:46,113 --> 01:39:47,183
Thus.

1304
01:39:47,982 --> 01:39:49,427
I did not even get the pass marks.

1305
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:55,960
Bye Doctor. I have rehearsals.
Give it to me.

1306
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:06,599
I mumbled as I walked around.
Will I tell you about the dream?

1307
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:10,377
I mumbled as I walked around.
Will I tell you about the dream?

1308
01:40:12,406 --> 01:40:14,750
A whitewashed house.

1309
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:19,220
Azure blooms in the garden.

1310
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:27,064
Green meadows and orange rocks,
amidst all of it my little one.

1311
01:40:30,257 --> 01:40:35,036
Toddling towards me.
I used to sing him lullabies.

1312
01:40:36,430 --> 01:40:40,071
The little mouse is
scared..what if the eagle.

1313
01:40:41,201 --> 01:40:47,550
Just him and me,
behind us a row of coconut trees.

1314
01:40:47,641 --> 01:40:54,115
A gurgling stream rushes
past in a hurry. My reverie...

1315
01:40:54,214 --> 01:40:55,488
Useless!

1316
01:40:56,583 --> 01:40:57,789
This is not working at all.

1317
01:40:58,385 --> 01:41:01,628
Do you realize the significance
of Shanti in this play ?

1318
01:41:04,158 --> 01:41:09,198
She may be ill, but she
is a mother and that is paramount.

1319
01:41:12,132 --> 01:41:15,341
I need to see that mother in you.

1320
01:41:17,304 --> 01:41:18,647
Now take it from the top again.

1321
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:25,046
Imported.

1322
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:28,117
Won't suit me then.

1323
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:34,465
You're developing a mother obsession.
Jung's mother complex.

1324
01:41:34,555 --> 01:41:36,728
Get out of it Bhoba.
- Yes, I'm obsessed with it.

1325
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:39,196
As I believe this
mother archetype is..

1326
01:41:39,293 --> 01:41:42,137
...woven in our
unconscious for centuries.

1327
01:41:42,596 --> 01:41:44,405
And it will motivate a change.

1328
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:46,072
I do not agree.

1329
01:41:46,233 --> 01:41:48,076
Analyse Bharat's (playwright)
"Principles of theatre"...

1330
01:41:48,235 --> 01:41:50,408
...all folk and traditional
forms of India".

1331
01:41:51,105 --> 01:41:52,516
'jatra' , 'noutanki' , 'tam ash a'...

1332
01:41:52,606 --> 01:41:54,813
There is always a mother figure.
- We're students of Dialectics.

1333
01:41:55,109 --> 01:41:57,749
I know. - Motivation
is the class struggle.

1334
01:41:58,712 --> 01:41:59,747
No.

1335
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:02,123
Genetics has a role to play too.

1336
01:42:02,716 --> 01:42:06,095
Our religious ways,
our history. - So...

1337
01:42:06,687 --> 01:42:09,725
...is religion your new opium?

1338
01:42:09,823 --> 01:42:13,430
You're well aware I'm a nonbeliever.
Gods don't suit me.

1339
01:42:14,128 --> 01:42:19,669
Rubbish! You're messing around
with religion and God these days.

1340
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:23,308
Forget it. You guys are
too set in your own ideas.

1341
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:27,719
No thanks,
he's supplying imported smokes.

1342
01:42:27,808 --> 01:42:34,384
"The rain."

1343
01:42:40,854 --> 01:42:47,430
"The clouds of rains have arrived."

1344
01:42:47,694 --> 01:42:54,270
"The lovely rains,
impressing the mind."

1345
01:42:54,468 --> 01:43:01,443
"The lovely rains,
impressing the mind."

1346
01:43:01,708 --> 01:43:06,453
"The rains have com e."

1347
01:43:10,584 --> 01:43:11,892
Dada was right.

1348
01:43:12,953 --> 01:43:14,591
Whether it's books or films...

1349
01:43:14,955 --> 01:43:17,265
...nobody is interested
in tales of hardship.

1350
01:43:18,525 --> 01:43:21,699
But endure they all
will in their realities.

1351
01:43:22,796 --> 01:43:25,402
Boring. Monotonous.

1352
01:43:25,499 --> 01:43:29,675
They're so eager to suffer.
But the moment you speak up...

1353
01:43:30,204 --> 01:43:34,209
...they will all disappear!

1354
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:37,655
Repetitive.

1355
01:43:37,811 --> 01:43:39,791
By the way, there's a good news.

1356
01:43:40,347 --> 01:43:43,226
An old friend from college, Suren.

1357
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:45,627
Bumped into him today.

1358
01:43:45,919 --> 01:43:47,728
That same old story.

1359
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:52,301
Com e, let's leave. - Bastards.

1360
01:44:07,407 --> 01:44:09,318
Watched my movie? -Yes.

1361
01:44:09,843 --> 01:44:14,349
You're not being able to rise
above your shanties and shackles.

1362
01:44:15,949 --> 01:44:17,223
Do you feel the same?

1363
01:44:17,384 --> 01:44:19,955
It's very important to understate
the melodrama in your art.

1364
01:44:20,354 --> 01:44:22,561
Don't you find your
dialogues superfluous?

1365
01:44:22,789 --> 01:44:25,827
Too many moments,
too many raw incidents.

1366
01:44:25,993 --> 01:44:27,233
Really?

1367
01:44:27,294 --> 01:44:30,867
Actually you're not being able
to break away from the theatre mould.

1368
01:44:31,565 --> 01:44:33,567
Coincidences at every step.

1369
01:44:33,867 --> 01:44:36,711
What about the narrative?

1370
01:44:36,770 --> 01:44:42,413
Its not working. - Uneven.
Rough. Your frames are disorganised.

1371
01:44:42,609 --> 01:44:43,883
Edit jerks.

1372
01:44:44,278 --> 01:44:46,019
Mr. Bagchi, what's happening?

1373
01:44:48,949 --> 01:44:50,019
Bye

1374
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:07,844
You put all your hard
earned money into your film ?

1375
01:45:09,703 --> 01:45:10,613
What could I do?

1376
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:16,480
What can I do if
my producer runs away?

1377
01:45:20,047 --> 01:45:21,788
All that you earned from
the British Tobacco commercial...

1378
01:45:21,882 --> 01:45:23,759
"invested it all in the film?

1379
01:45:26,553 --> 01:45:27,793
And your family?

1380
01:45:30,957 --> 01:45:32,368
What about them?

1381
01:45:34,027 --> 01:45:35,506
Then the film would
not have happened.

1382
01:45:39,499 --> 01:45:42,480
In spite of the humiliation,

1383
01:45:43,603 --> 01:45:45,446
I took up office plays for the money.

1384
01:45:49,743 --> 01:45:50,778
And look at you.

1385
01:45:53,513 --> 01:45:55,993
What are we Bikram da ?

1386
01:45:56,917 --> 01:45:58,590
Intellectuals or...

1387
01:45:59,052 --> 01:46:00,793
...entertainment experts ?

1388
01:46:07,461 --> 01:46:08,599
Have some money to spare?

1389
01:46:12,499 --> 01:46:13,443
"Life...

1390
01:46:14,501 --> 01:46:16,344
...is but a walking shadow...

1391
01:46:18,105 --> 01:46:19,948
...a poor player...

1392
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:24,420
...that struts and frets
his hours upon the stage...

1393
01:46:25,011 --> 01:46:26,081
...and then...

1394
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:28,482
...is heard no more"

1395
01:46:40,527 --> 01:46:41,801
30,110 you guys...

1396
01:46:43,130 --> 01:46:45,371
...watch cinema?

1397
01:46:46,633 --> 01:46:51,412
Days that we get good
money picking pockets, we do.

1398
01:46:51,938 --> 01:46:57,980
I've seen "Kashmir ki kali",
"Sangam" .

1399
01:46:58,078 --> 01:47:01,389
We are Shammi Kapur fans.

1400
01:47:02,582 --> 01:47:07,588
Don't mind brother,
we don't understand your films.

1401
01:47:08,088 --> 01:47:09,499
So we don't watch.

1402
01:47:09,589 --> 01:47:10,966
What's new in that?

1403
01:47:11,691 --> 01:47:13,102
No one understands.

1404
01:47:15,095 --> 01:47:17,974
Does any son of a bitch
out here understand movies at all?

1405
01:47:18,899 --> 01:47:20,708
That I don't know but...

1406
01:47:21,668 --> 01:47:23,944
...all I understand is that...

1407
01:47:24,704 --> 01:47:27,548
you understand.

1408
01:47:28,742 --> 01:47:29,846
You do.

1409
01:47:30,477 --> 01:47:31,922
I? -Yes.

1410
01:47:32,913 --> 01:47:33,948
How do you know that?

1411
01:47:34,915 --> 01:47:37,156
You're just like us.

1412
01:47:39,019 --> 01:47:40,930
Living off the streets.

1413
01:47:44,090 --> 01:47:45,125
What's that? Gram seeds ?

1414
01:48:16,022 --> 01:48:17,660
Mr.Nirodh had come over.

1415
01:48:20,927 --> 01:48:23,965
He was planning a documentary
by you on Ustad Alam Khan.

1416
01:48:24,064 --> 01:48:25,771
He's given up on that plan.

1417
01:48:27,067 --> 01:48:28,171
Came to convey the news.

1418
01:48:44,751 --> 01:48:45,661
Give it.

1419
01:49:26,726 --> 01:49:27,602
Who is it?

1420
01:49:27,994 --> 01:49:29,132
Minu, are you home?

1421
01:49:33,867 --> 01:49:34,937
Is everything okay Nil da?

1422
01:49:37,203 --> 01:49:38,705
Can I get some food ?

1423
01:49:39,639 --> 01:49:41,846
Have been drinking since
morning on an empty stomach.

1424
01:49:44,244 --> 01:49:47,054
Come inside. Please come inside.

1425
01:49:50,817 --> 01:49:52,091
Sure you had enough?

1426
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:53,595
Yes.

1427
01:49:55,355 --> 01:49:57,596
You all carry on. Go sleep.

1428
01:49:57,991 --> 01:49:59,800
I will doze off there.

1429
01:50:03,096 --> 01:50:04,575
And listen.

1430
01:50:06,166 --> 01:50:09,875
You have those long playing
records of Tagore songs, right ?

1431
01:50:11,271 --> 01:50:13,148
Leave them here.

1432
01:50:18,345 --> 01:50:22,020
You are very sad, isn't it Nil da?

1433
01:50:22,115 --> 01:50:25,858
You put in your best
We all worked so hard.

1434
01:50:26,286 --> 01:50:28,197
But then the people rejected it.

1435
01:50:31,925 --> 01:50:33,302
In such times...

1436
01:50:34,861 --> 01:50:36,636
...always rem ember Tagore.

1437
01:50:39,032 --> 01:50:42,206
"Losing faith in humanity is a sin".

1438
01:50:44,371 --> 01:50:46,942
Whatever happens,
I will make a film again.

1439
01:50:49,743 --> 01:50:50,915
Leave the records and go.

1440
01:50:55,715 --> 01:50:56,659
Go!

1441
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:01,121
Okay.

1442
01:51:16,670 --> 01:51:21,670
"In happiness and in sadness,
within a heavy heart..who.."

1443
01:51:29,015 --> 01:51:38,424
".. is playing the flute"

1444
01:51:38,692 --> 01:51:43,692
"Who is playing flute
throughout my being"

1445
01:51:49,736 --> 01:51:51,875
Fidel Castro has launched
a revolution from

1446
01:51:51,971 --> 01:51:54,178
...his camp in the
Sierra Maestra mountains.

1447
01:51:54,474 --> 01:51:57,353
Adolf Eichmann, one of the members
of the Austrian Nazi party...

1448
01:52:02,182 --> 01:52:08,360
"In happiness and in sadness."

1449
01:52:08,455 --> 01:52:14,701
"..within a heavy heart..who.."

1450
01:52:14,794 --> 01:52:16,467
Yuri Gagarin the Russian astronaut

1451
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:19,210
ventured into space
on his orbital flight.

1452
01:52:19,299 --> 01:52:21,040
While riding in an automobile
procession in Dallas,

1453
01:52:21,167 --> 01:52:22,475
...firing from an upper
floor of a building.

1454
01:52:22,736 --> 01:52:25,842
John F Kennedy was shot
to death by an assassin...

1455
01:52:25,939 --> 01:52:31,252
"Who is playing flute
throughout my being"

1456
01:52:31,344 --> 01:52:34,018
"North Korea had seized
US navy ship Pueblo,

1457
01:52:34,147 --> 01:52:36,889
all on board have been
taken prisoner as American spies.

1458
01:52:36,983 --> 01:52:39,759
On the first day of
celebration of the lunar year,

1459
01:52:39,853 --> 01:52:41,491
Vietnam’s most important holiday,

1460
01:52:41,755 --> 01:52:47,364
the Vietnamese
Communists launched a...

1461
01:52:47,994 --> 01:52:51,271
"Feeling the rhythm
of blossoming flower,

1462
01:52:51,364 --> 01:52:54,208
the soul and body feels complete"

1463
01:52:54,300 --> 01:53:00,273
"What a beautiful fragrance.."

1464
01:53:00,373 --> 01:53:06,483
"..is afloat in the air"

1465
01:53:06,946 --> 01:53:16,162
"Who is playing flute
throughout my being"

1466
01:53:16,256 --> 01:53:17,894
Why do you move away...

1467
01:53:17,991 --> 01:53:20,972
...from the sunshine,
from it's heat?

1468
01:53:21,928 --> 01:53:23,874
You fear to break away,

1469
01:53:24,864 --> 01:53:27,071
It's not a material success.

1470
01:53:28,368 --> 01:53:30,507
Seek like the waves do.

1471
01:53:30,804 --> 01:53:34,775
Or sink into the transparent
heart like does the mirror.

1472
01:53:35,475 --> 01:53:37,216
How are you Narayan ?

1473
01:53:37,310 --> 01:53:39,916
Who are you? -A drunkard.

1474
01:53:40,013 --> 01:53:41,993
He is quite a well known man.

1475
01:53:42,415 --> 01:53:43,985
A man with no politics.

1476
01:53:51,558 --> 01:53:52,866
Where are you?

1477
01:53:56,029 --> 01:53:56,939
Listen .

1478
01:53:58,264 --> 01:54:00,471
The Party Secretary himself
called me and said...

1479
01:54:01,134 --> 01:54:02,442
...Nilkantha...

1480
01:54:02,969 --> 01:54:06,075
...you're the only people's
artist in the country.

1481
01:54:10,276 --> 01:54:13,416
I'm dropping this year.
Won't sit for the exam this year.

1482
01:54:14,347 --> 01:54:16,918
Couldn't even pay
off the maids this year.

1483
01:54:18,318 --> 01:54:19,319
It'll be fine.

1484
01:54:21,154 --> 01:54:24,829
Chitramohan Pictures owes you money.
When are going to ask for..

1485
01:54:28,895 --> 01:54:29,999
Yes... err...

1486
01:54:32,632 --> 01:54:35,841
You don't matter. You may go.

1487
01:54:35,902 --> 01:54:38,280
But I will stay back.
I want to know.

1488
01:54:38,872 --> 01:54:43,014
Where do you get
the motivation to fight?

1489
01:54:43,643 --> 01:54:46,954
See, we're expecting
a police attack any moment.

1490
01:54:47,046 --> 01:54:49,048
Don't you know there's
an operation going on here.

1491
01:54:49,148 --> 01:54:50,286
But still I will stay.

1492
01:54:51,150 --> 01:54:53,323
There's nothing more
left in this Bengal of mine.

1493
01:54:53,419 --> 01:54:57,162
It's only you guys who're
twinkling in this darkness!

1494
01:54:58,391 --> 01:54:59,961
Partisans

1495
01:55:14,474 --> 01:55:17,921
All films are political
as all art is...

1496
01:55:18,411 --> 01:55:20,186
...and all artists are.

1497
01:55:20,313 --> 01:55:22,987
The point is which side you take.

1498
01:55:23,182 --> 01:55:25,025
Sir, which side did you take,

1499
01:55:25,118 --> 01:55:26,893
when you moved to
Filmistan for writing...

1500
01:55:26,986 --> 01:55:28,431
...commercial Hindi films?

1501
01:55:29,355 --> 01:55:32,199
Or while you did an ad
film for a cigarette brand?

1502
01:55:32,325 --> 01:55:34,532
Is it true that you're being
commissioned a documentary...

1503
01:55:34,627 --> 01:55:36,903
...featuring the Prime
Minister of the country?

1504
01:55:46,572 --> 01:55:48,518
You're feelings are perceptive.

1505
01:55:49,976 --> 01:55:52,957
The vow of self sacrifice
mesmerizes me but...

1506
01:55:54,213 --> 01:55:55,920
...you guys have been misguided.

1507
01:55:56,249 --> 01:55:57,922
Like the agitated ones
from the Reign of Terror.

1508
01:55:58,017 --> 01:56:00,327
Don't talk rubbish!
Have you read anything?

1509
01:56:00,420 --> 01:56:03,333
Red Book,
Guevera's diary, CPO report?

1510
01:56:03,957 --> 01:56:05,937
Why are you interfering
without reading all this?

1511
01:56:07,961 --> 01:56:10,464
Have you guys read
the history of India?

1512
01:56:11,664 --> 01:56:13,541
How many thousand
years does it stand?

1513
01:56:13,633 --> 01:56:15,613
The history of oppression
and deprivation?

1514
01:56:15,702 --> 01:56:18,615
And the history of serious
philosophical thoughts.

1515
01:56:19,505 --> 01:56:22,247
To uproot those oppressions
and deprivations...

1516
01:56:22,375 --> 01:56:24,480
...you've to read it, know it.

1517
01:56:25,178 --> 01:56:28,182
And then we'll have to rot
ourselves drinking to death, right?

1518
01:56:28,281 --> 01:56:30,192
Bloody Nihilist!

1519
01:56:36,489 --> 01:56:38,560
A young boy struck by a bullet.

1520
01:56:39,459 --> 01:56:42,269
He could be a student or a farmer.

1521
01:56:43,463 --> 01:56:45,500
He falls on the earth.

1522
01:56:46,299 --> 01:56:49,508
He bleeds profusely,
the blood that the earth sucks on.

1523
01:56:50,203 --> 01:56:53,616
Tearing apart the heart
of that soil, rose a Vietnam.

1524
01:56:56,609 --> 01:56:57,610
I fake.

1525
01:56:59,512 --> 01:57:02,550
I pose of being displeased too.

1526
01:57:04,550 --> 01:57:07,121
I lie too,
for the money for my alcohol.

1527
01:57:08,054 --> 01:57:09,260
But...

1528
01:57:10,256 --> 01:57:13,260
...for name, fame and recognition...

1529
01:57:13,726 --> 01:57:16,036
...I won't ever lie.

1530
01:57:16,329 --> 01:57:17,740
Is this a pose too?

1531
01:57:18,698 --> 01:57:21,338
You've learnt to
trick men pretty well.

1532
01:57:26,039 --> 01:57:27,712
He's caught me!

1533
01:57:30,743 --> 01:57:32,586
But I tell one thing honestly...

1534
01:57:34,347 --> 01:57:35,621
MN]

1535
01:57:37,216 --> 01:57:39,127
...confused. Utterly confused.

1536
01:57:43,389 --> 01:57:44,333
Brother!

1537
01:57:47,794 --> 01:57:51,435
Praise the Goddess Durga!
Praise the Goddess Durga!

1538
01:57:51,531 --> 01:57:55,536
Praise the Goddess Durga!
Praise the Goddess Durga!

1539
01:57:55,601 --> 01:57:59,378
Praise the Goddess Durga!
Praise the Goddess Durga!

1540
01:57:59,505 --> 01:58:03,282
Praise the Goddess Durga!
Praise the Goddess Durga!

1541
01:58:03,376 --> 01:58:07,051
Praise the Goddess Durga!
Praise the Goddess Durga!

1542
01:58:07,313 --> 01:58:10,783
Praise the Goddess Durga!
Praise the Goddess Durga!

1543
01:58:10,850 --> 01:58:14,559
Praise the Goddess Durga!
Praise the Goddess Durga!

1544
01:58:14,654 --> 01:58:18,295
Praise the Goddess Durga!
Praise the Goddess Durga!

1545
01:58:18,558 --> 01:58:21,562
Praise the Goddess Durga!
Praise the Goddess Durga!

1546
01:58:35,808 --> 01:58:38,516
Did you lose yourself
or did you run away?

1547
01:58:40,746 --> 01:58:42,487
What do you think?

1548
01:58:43,549 --> 01:58:45,085
It's difficult to tell.

1549
01:58:45,785 --> 01:58:48,493
I can't really decipher you.

1550
01:58:49,522 --> 01:58:51,729
Don't even try to.

1551
01:58:52,325 --> 01:58:54,327
I'm a ball of fire, Doctor.

1552
01:58:54,627 --> 01:58:56,197
You'll burn your hand.

1553
01:58:58,331 --> 01:59:02,609
Our play's climax, as in..
how we are looking at it.

1554
01:59:02,869 --> 01:59:04,849
Shanti is recovering
from her illness,

1555
01:59:05,138 --> 01:59:06,446
her delusions are clearing out.

1556
01:59:06,539 --> 01:59:08,576
The tempest dance!

1557
01:59:09,876 --> 01:59:12,516
Phulmoni, come here!

1558
01:59:13,646 --> 01:59:14,647
Com e.

1559
01:59:14,914 --> 01:59:17,394
Come sit. Come on.

1560
01:59:20,653 --> 01:59:23,691
So, won't you dance dear?

1561
01:59:24,323 --> 01:59:27,429
Mr. Bagchi, I think Phulmoni
won't be able to, leave her.

1562
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:28,561
Definitely she can.

1563
01:59:28,828 --> 01:59:31,240
It won't happen if
she does not dance. Go!

1564
01:59:36,202 --> 01:59:39,445
So... won't you dance?

1565
01:59:42,875 --> 01:59:43,910
Sound!

1566
01:59:47,580 --> 01:59:54,464
The grills are turning into
black snakes for Shanti, Phulmoni.

1567
01:59:55,888 --> 02:00:01,839
And this huge lock is
transforming into Goddess Kali.

1568
02:00:02,428 --> 02:00:03,839
A tempest everywhere!

1569
02:00:08,701 --> 02:00:11,682
Blood all around! Horrifying

1570
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:16,652
The earth is shaking!

1571
02:00:18,844 --> 02:00:20,619
Death is embracing itself!

1572
02:00:22,548 --> 02:00:25,188
Amidst that one has to Break away,
set sail on

1573
02:00:25,251 --> 02:00:29,427
...on a new sea shore!

1574
02:00:29,956 --> 02:00:32,630
The guard tolls the bell,
orders are here!

1575
02:00:33,259 --> 02:00:37,730
The bondage of the port
has been unleashed for good!

1576
02:00:38,364 --> 02:00:44,508
The old saving out on sail, no more!

1577
02:01:07,827 --> 02:01:08,931
Lights off!

1578
02:01:09,862 --> 02:01:11,808
Nothing is happening!

1579
02:01:12,565 --> 02:01:16,240
But why not?

1580
02:01:17,003 --> 02:01:20,507
Look here,
we are all insane here, all crazy.

1581
02:01:20,573 --> 02:01:21,950
But, if that insanity"

1582
02:01:22,041 --> 02:01:24,248
But if that insanity isn't released,

1583
02:01:24,310 --> 02:01:26,881
will any creation happen? No!

1584
02:01:26,979 --> 02:01:30,825
Nothing! -You need to take rest.

1585
02:01:30,916 --> 02:01:32,452
Go back to your cabin,
you need to sleep.

1586
02:01:32,551 --> 02:01:33,325
No.

1587
02:01:33,419 --> 02:01:35,262
Bhusan, Bhusan!- Yes!

1588
02:01:35,354 --> 02:01:36,992
I won't.
I'm awake for the first time...

1589
02:01:37,290 --> 02:01:39,395
and all before have
been decades of mean sleep

1590
02:01:39,492 --> 02:01:41,699
Take him away.
- Leave me you scoundrel!

1591
02:01:41,794 --> 02:01:42,932
Please calm down.
- Mr. Nilkanth, please calm down.

1592
02:01:43,029 --> 02:01:44,303
I'm awake!

1593
02:01:44,397 --> 02:01:45,740
Leave me you scoundrel!

1594
02:01:45,831 --> 02:01:49,438
I am awake!

1595
02:01:49,935 --> 02:01:52,973
I am awake! - Please calm down.

1596
02:01:53,039 --> 02:01:56,316
- I am awake!
- Nilkanth!

1597
02:02:15,995 --> 02:02:18,942
This won't do. This won't work.

1598
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,913
I need alcohol.

1599
02:02:24,337 --> 02:02:26,317
Nothing can happen without it.

1600
02:02:27,006 --> 02:02:28,508
Give me some money.

1601
02:02:28,607 --> 02:02:29,881
I need a bottle.

1602
02:02:31,744 --> 02:02:32,848
Dugga...

1603
02:02:33,979 --> 02:02:36,323
Give me some money.
I'll get myself a bottle.

1604
02:02:36,816 --> 02:02:40,764
I'm not being able to work without it.
Give me some money.

1605
02:02:41,420 --> 02:02:44,026
Please, get me a bottle.

1606
02:02:44,457 --> 02:02:46,368
My brain's not working, trust me!

1607
02:02:46,459 --> 02:02:49,099
Please give me some money!
- There is no money!

1608
02:02:53,065 --> 02:02:55,045
Do you have any idea how
I'm affording this hospital?

1609
02:02:55,901 --> 02:02:57,812
Bringing up the kids,
the household...

1610
02:02:57,903 --> 02:02:58,938
...where is the money coming from?

1611
02:02:59,638 --> 02:03:02,050
You don't care about anything!
Only your alcohol!

1612
02:03:02,508 --> 02:03:04,818
Look at yourself! You're perishing!

1613
02:03:04,910 --> 02:03:08,016
I know! Everything
is burning out within me!

1614
02:03:08,647 --> 02:03:10,752
It's all burning away.
Just give me one bottle!

1615
02:03:10,850 --> 02:03:13,387
Just one bottle!

1616
02:03:14,987 --> 02:03:17,126
A little bit of money.

1617
02:03:18,991 --> 02:03:20,436
Fine, this is the end.

1618
02:03:21,861 --> 02:03:23,135
I'll never get you admitted again.

1619
02:03:24,797 --> 02:03:26,003
I'll not say anything.

1620
02:03:26,465 --> 02:03:29,912
Please listen, I'll quit drinking,
once this play is done.

1621
02:03:30,736 --> 02:03:34,878
There's another good news.
- What is it?

1622
02:03:38,911 --> 02:03:40,447
The results are out.

1623
02:03:41,147 --> 02:03:43,684
I've got a teacher's job
at a primary school near Shithigram.

1624
02:03:43,883 --> 02:03:44,953
I'm leaving...

1625
02:03:45,751 --> 02:03:46,889
...with the kids.

1626
02:03:50,623 --> 02:03:51,693
What about me?

1627
02:03:51,824 --> 02:03:53,997
Don't you know what will
happen if you drink again?

1628
02:03:55,995 --> 02:03:57,633
Why have you been brought here?

1629
02:04:01,133 --> 02:04:02,908
I can't work!

1630
02:04:03,002 --> 02:04:09,510
"The mango trees are decorated.."

1631
02:04:13,979 --> 02:04:19,895
"..the wedding is happening
under the banana tree"

1632
02:04:23,222 --> 02:04:29,002
"The handsome groom has arrived.."

1633
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:40,676
"..with the wedding
crown on his head"

1634
02:04:41,106 --> 02:04:43,177
Hope you are fine, Sister.

1635
02:04:43,676 --> 02:04:48,557
"The mango trees are decorated.."

1636
02:04:49,482 --> 02:04:52,929
I'm leaving, Baba.
Let's go. -God bless you.

1637
02:04:53,018 --> 02:04:58,559
"..The wedding is happening
under the banana tree"

1638
02:05:02,695 --> 02:05:04,003
Mother.

1639
02:05:05,197 --> 02:05:06,938
Where's your father? Inside.

1640
02:05:07,233 --> 02:05:08,177
Come on.

1641
02:05:13,806 --> 02:05:16,218
Nothing can happen in this house.

1642
02:05:20,980 --> 02:05:23,187
What was wrong with
the film institute's job?

1643
02:05:24,283 --> 02:05:26,058
You were doing good with
your students and films.

1644
02:05:26,151 --> 02:05:26,925
Why did you quit?

1645
02:05:27,786 --> 02:05:30,198
I feel claustrophobic stuck
at one place for too long..

1646
02:05:30,289 --> 02:05:31,700
What the hell do you
keep writing all day?

1647
02:05:33,292 --> 02:05:35,135
Will I write accounts?

1648
02:05:35,961 --> 02:05:39,499
I have finished seven scripts.
-Not one has been made into a film!

1649
02:05:39,565 --> 02:05:40,942
No one reads them,
neither pays money.

1650
02:05:41,567 --> 02:05:44,070
Look at your friends.
Is anyone of them like you?

1651
02:05:44,703 --> 02:05:46,705
Can you find anyone lazing
around in that cafe anymore?

1652
02:06:13,699 --> 02:06:16,646
Hey Bagchi, come!

1653
02:06:17,736 --> 02:06:19,272
Come!

1654
02:06:26,145 --> 02:06:31,686
Let's have a couple of pegs?
- No, I'm carrying my own.

1655
02:06:33,686 --> 02:06:34,756
What took you so much time?

1656
02:06:36,589 --> 02:06:40,560
Two groups of communists were
fighting in front of Shahid Minar.

1657
02:06:40,859 --> 02:06:45,171
The third power has declared the
formation of a new party, you see.

1658
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:48,578
Why suddenly today.'

1659
02:06:49,134 --> 02:06:50,204
After so many days?

1660
02:06:52,037 --> 02:06:53,175
What's the date today.'

1661
02:06:55,608 --> 02:06:56,643
1st May.

1662
02:06:58,143 --> 02:07:01,590
I need some money.
That's why l came.

1663
02:07:14,159 --> 02:07:18,904
I read your novel 'Jathor'.
In the newspaper.

1664
02:07:19,798 --> 02:07:20,868
Quite a...

1665
02:07:22,368 --> 02:07:23,904
Sleazy Crap

1666
02:07:30,242 --> 02:07:33,189
I'm a pimp if I'm writing
about human feelings.

1667
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:37,861
Writing about relationships
means getting purchased.

1668
02:07:38,417 --> 02:07:40,294
Whose feeling? Whose relationships?

1669
02:07:40,386 --> 02:07:41,660
And who is publishing all of it?

1670
02:07:41,820 --> 02:07:44,892
The 'partisan thing'
is not selling anymore Bagchi.

1671
02:07:44,990 --> 02:07:46,731
You rascal!

1672
02:07:55,100 --> 02:07:58,912
Is there any use abusing me Bagchi?

1673
02:08:00,806 --> 02:08:05,221
Your Mohit,
is earning money in Bombay now.

1674
02:08:06,378 --> 02:08:07,721
And An on do?

1675
02:08:08,881 --> 02:08:11,293
A petty villain in the Hindi films.

1676
02:08:14,853 --> 02:08:19,802
Since you've been screaming
for the reunion of two Bengals.

1677
02:08:20,926 --> 02:08:23,873
And now, when the mass revolution
has set East Bengal on fire?

1678
02:08:25,297 --> 02:08:26,275
Where are you now?

1679
02:08:26,832 --> 02:08:27,776
At country liquor shops?

1680
02:08:29,268 --> 02:08:31,305
That is bothering you? -Yes it is!

1681
02:08:31,403 --> 02:08:33,849
That is precisely the
reason I'm drinking you moron.

1682
02:08:38,944 --> 02:08:40,355
Get bothered.

1683
02:08:41,447 --> 02:08:43,222
Practice getting bothered.

1684
02:08:45,884 --> 02:08:46,988
I could not do anything.

1685
02:08:50,355 --> 02:08:52,096
If it bothers you people...

1686
02:08:54,259 --> 02:08:55,363
...may be things can work out.

1687
02:09:10,743 --> 02:09:11,881
Genocide had taken place...

1688
02:09:11,977 --> 02:09:15,720
in the hamlets of My Lai My
Khe in the Son My village in Vietnam

1689
02:09:16,014 --> 02:09:17,391
Most of the victims were women,

1690
02:09:17,483 --> 02:09:20,191
children including
babies and elderly people.

1691
02:09:56,021 --> 02:09:58,228
Is Kshiti babu inside? -Yes.

1692
02:09:58,423 --> 02:10:01,063
He's there. -Nilkantha Bagchi.

1693
02:10:01,193 --> 02:10:02,263
I know.

1694
02:10:03,862 --> 02:10:07,173
I've written a new script.
He had asked me to come.

1695
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:10,077
There's a meeting going on inside.

1696
02:10:10,502 --> 02:10:13,346
He's a producer after all.
A little busy right now.

1697
02:10:13,438 --> 02:10:15,941
Com e. Please sit for a while. Com e.

1698
02:10:30,489 --> 02:10:31,991
This year"

1699
02:10:33,325 --> 02:10:35,396
...a lot of films are being made.

1700
02:10:38,397 --> 02:10:39,876
Lot's of films, huh?

1701
02:10:40,265 --> 02:10:42,575
Sit here.
I'll call you when Sir's free.

1702
02:10:42,835 --> 02:10:47,147
"From one side to the other,
The boat's helm is moving"

1703
02:10:55,180 --> 02:11:00,152
"The water of the river
is noisily moving up and down"

1704
02:11:03,155 --> 02:11:06,295
A slum in Kolkata.

1705
02:11:08,861 --> 02:11:10,862
Ugly, tattered huts.

1706
02:11:10,863 --> 02:11:15,141
"The honeybees are
playing on the flowers.."

1707
02:11:15,267 --> 02:11:17,008
A mother...

1708
02:11:18,937 --> 02:11:20,610
...beside a frail child.

1709
02:12:20,332 --> 02:12:21,640
Sir.

1710
02:12:22,167 --> 02:12:23,441
Sir.

1711
02:12:23,702 --> 02:12:24,942
Wake up.

1712
02:12:25,137 --> 02:12:27,208
It's morning.

1713
02:12:33,378 --> 02:12:34,448
Morning!

1714
02:12:46,091 --> 02:12:47,536
I've seen him somewhere.

1715
02:12:48,126 --> 02:12:51,437
Roams around the burning ghats

1716
02:12:51,530 --> 02:12:54,204
A drunkard... is he alive?

1717
02:12:56,268 --> 02:12:58,942
I know him. He is the loony Bhoba.

1718
02:13:05,077 --> 02:13:07,421
Oh no! Isn't this Nilkantha Bagchi?

1719
02:13:23,161 --> 02:13:30,079
"My beloved is come."

1720
02:13:30,168 --> 02:13:37,313
"My beloved is come."

1721
02:13:38,210 --> 02:13:43,626
"My mind is happy."

1722
02:13:43,715 --> 02:13:49,996
"My beloved is come."

1723
02:13:51,156 --> 02:13:57,004
"My beloved is come."

1724
02:14:03,135 --> 02:14:05,342
Madam, madam!

1725
02:14:05,470 --> 02:14:06,448
Doctor"

1726
02:14:10,175 --> 02:14:12,314
I'm sorry Ma'am,
his condition is extremely serious.

1727
02:14:13,145 --> 02:14:16,024
We can begin with the treatment
of his physical aliments...

1728
02:14:16,081 --> 02:14:19,028
...but we need to refer the
case to the psychiatry department.

1729
02:14:21,053 --> 02:14:22,225
Psychiatry?

1730
02:14:23,121 --> 02:14:25,226
For alcohol detoxification.

1731
02:14:25,657 --> 02:14:27,728
Without that we won't
be able to save him .

1732
02:14:33,231 --> 02:14:35,472
Could you give me an estimate of...

1733
02:14:35,767 --> 02:14:37,644
...how much money would be required?

1734
02:14:39,604 --> 02:14:43,484
It is estimated that around
million East Bengali refugees

1735
02:14:43,575 --> 02:14:46,681
...entered India during
the early months of the war.

1736
02:15:12,104 --> 02:15:14,277
Near Gorkha Brigade,
Border Security club lost by 10...

1737
02:15:14,372 --> 02:15:17,649
...in the Durand cup finals.

1738
02:15:38,163 --> 02:15:39,369
Come on Jagaddal!

1739
02:15:47,372 --> 02:15:48,373
Jagaddal!

1740
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:56,416
How much?

1741
02:15:57,149 --> 02:15:59,288
Two rupees per ton sir.

1742
02:15:59,784 --> 02:16:02,321
You'll not find this
opportunity again!

1743
02:16:02,420 --> 02:16:04,422
Give away all that you have!

1744
02:16:04,556 --> 02:16:08,902
This won't even
be four to five tons.

1745
02:16:10,162 --> 02:16:13,143
Moreover it's only junk.

1746
02:16:13,698 --> 02:16:14,870
Junk!?

1747
02:16:53,271 --> 02:16:54,375
Bhoba.

1748
02:16:58,843 --> 02:17:01,255
How much?

1749
02:17:03,315 --> 02:17:05,761
There's no answer to that.

1750
02:17:07,552 --> 02:17:09,361
You've failed.

1751
02:17:10,922 --> 02:17:16,600
All of it has been robbed.

1752
02:17:19,297 --> 02:17:21,675
We've all faded away...

1753
02:17:23,435 --> 02:17:25,278
...in the air.

1754
02:17:27,005 --> 02:17:28,746
We're finished.

1755
02:17:33,311 --> 02:17:34,654
Won't Nil survive...

1756
02:17:36,248 --> 02:17:37,249
...Bikram da?

1757
02:17:40,252 --> 02:17:42,232
I've packed your bags.

1758
02:17:43,855 --> 02:17:45,266
You should leave.

1759
02:17:46,958 --> 02:17:48,699
You're successful.

1760
02:17:50,695 --> 02:17:53,232
You've always been
behind him, honey.

1761
02:17:55,033 --> 02:17:56,307
Go.

1762
02:17:57,269 --> 02:17:58,009
Go away.

1763
02:17:58,803 --> 02:17:59,941
Go. - Based on the story of Amitabh

1764
02:18:00,038 --> 02:18:01,415
Choudhury, the film 'Mon Niye',

1765
02:18:01,506 --> 02:18:04,316
...directed by Salil Sen, starring
the famous pair Uttam Suchitra,

1766
02:18:04,409 --> 02:18:06,855
...has opened out a new
horizon for psychological..

1767
02:18:06,945 --> 02:18:08,982
"Thrillers in Bengali films.

1768
02:18:14,753 --> 02:18:15,788
Dugga.

1769
02:18:18,923 --> 02:18:20,334
Dugga.

1770
02:18:28,600 --> 02:18:29,601
No.

1771
02:18:31,303 --> 02:18:31,940
Here.

1772
02:18:36,341 --> 02:18:37,479
Again?

1773
02:18:40,478 --> 02:18:41,923
It makes me feel sleepy.

1774
02:18:45,083 --> 02:18:46,721
How many more cycles to go?

1775
02:18:47,652 --> 02:18:49,393
One more, day after.

1776
02:18:49,921 --> 02:18:51,025
You're free to go after that.

1777
02:18:51,923 --> 02:18:55,393
Day after? That's when the
first show is and you guys are...

1778
02:18:55,493 --> 02:18:58,030
That's in the morning
and the show is in the evening.

1779
02:18:58,496 --> 02:19:00,533
You can be brought here
for the show in that case.

1780
02:19:01,433 --> 02:19:02,503
And backstage?

1781
02:19:03,935 --> 02:19:05,539
Will those fools be able to manage?

1782
02:19:06,571 --> 02:19:08,812
Set, lights, curtains, bell.

1783
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:10,041
Sure they will.

1784
02:19:10,442 --> 02:19:11,887
And we'll all be there, don't worry.

1785
02:19:12,977 --> 02:19:15,480
And you too have to recover, right?

1786
02:19:19,884 --> 02:19:22,330
Have you been able to figure
out what my disease is Doctor?

1787
02:19:27,859 --> 02:19:29,395
You believe in life.

1788
02:19:29,961 --> 02:19:30,939
So there's light.

1789
02:19:31,963 --> 02:19:33,840
But you don't care
about your own life.

1790
02:19:34,966 --> 02:19:35,967
That's when the darkness strikes.

1791
02:19:37,669 --> 02:19:39,114
You are a science student.

1792
02:19:43,541 --> 02:19:46,488
Could you tell me,
what is the physical state of fire?

1793
02:19:52,550 --> 02:19:53,893
Phulmoni, come here.

1794
02:19:55,086 --> 02:19:57,692
Yes? What do you need here ?

1795
02:19:58,156 --> 02:20:00,659
Come on, go back to your bed.
- Who's it?

1796
02:20:03,561 --> 02:20:04,801
Let her come in.

1797
02:20:06,498 --> 02:20:07,476
Make it fast

1798
02:20:09,801 --> 02:20:11,371
Come in.

1799
02:20:13,104 --> 02:20:14,139
Dada.

1800
02:20:17,142 --> 02:20:19,884
Phulmoni!

1801
02:20:22,981 --> 02:20:26,451
Tomorrow is the climax of our play.

1802
02:20:27,619 --> 02:20:29,599
If you don't dance...

1803
02:20:31,689 --> 02:20:33,464
...it'll not reach it's crescendo.

1804
02:20:37,896 --> 02:20:40,740
Won't you dance, honey?

1805
02:20:43,067 --> 02:20:44,671
Won't you dance?

1806
02:20:57,715 --> 02:20:59,626
I was reading a novel.

1807
02:21:00,218 --> 02:21:02,425
I'm thinking if
I could work with it.

1808
02:21:03,555 --> 02:21:05,000
Have you heard of Malopara?

1809
02:21:05,523 --> 02:21:08,026
Do it, it'll work out well.

1810
02:21:12,163 --> 02:21:13,608
Anyway!

1811
02:21:14,799 --> 02:21:17,780
Today all the pain in my
heart and body shall cease to exist.

1812
02:21:20,238 --> 02:21:22,718
You must come to watch
the play in the evening.

1813
02:21:28,813 --> 02:21:30,053
There's a good news.

1814
02:21:32,217 --> 02:21:36,188
You're going away
to Shithigram, right?

1815
02:21:44,762 --> 02:21:47,709
The government is honoring you
with the Padamasree award this year.

1816
02:21:50,735 --> 02:21:55,206
In that easel must make amends
for all the defects in my body now!

1817
02:23:04,142 --> 02:23:05,553
Father!

1818
02:23:06,277 --> 02:23:07,551
Hey!

1819
02:23:19,624 --> 02:23:20,659
You've come back here again?

1820
02:23:22,594 --> 02:23:23,971
What do you need here now?

1821
02:23:25,597 --> 02:23:27,577
You have been a good wife...

1822
02:23:28,366 --> 02:23:29,811
...and a good mother...

1823
02:23:30,602 --> 02:23:31,979
to my son!

1824
02:23:37,809 --> 02:23:39,220
I could not go on anymore.

1825
02:23:41,179 --> 02:23:42,123
Fine.

1826
02:23:43,147 --> 02:23:44,592
But can't this..

1827
02:23:45,049 --> 02:23:46,653
...exchange of hatred
linger some more.

1828
02:23:46,751 --> 02:23:47,855
No.

1829
02:23:50,888 --> 02:23:52,094
I will not let you go.

1830
02:23:55,960 --> 02:23:59,772
I'm planning to leave very
early in the morning tomorrow.

1831
02:24:01,633 --> 02:24:02,839
Could you...

1832
02:24:03,668 --> 02:24:04,942
...come to the jungle once?

1833
02:24:06,771 --> 02:24:09,809
Let's see.
-Err.. you must bring Satya along too.

1834
02:24:12,677 --> 02:24:13,712
Why?

1835
02:24:22,754 --> 02:24:24,734
I want to see his face...

1836
02:24:25,890 --> 02:24:27,961
...in the light of a new dawn.

1837
02:24:28,660 --> 02:24:29,638
Then I'll leave.

1838
02:24:43,441 --> 02:24:45,318
Dugga!

1839
02:24:46,110 --> 02:24:51,685
"Surge, swell Oh! mighty waves!
Smash,shatter as shackles do break"

1840
02:24:51,783 --> 02:24:52,784
Dugga!

1841
02:24:53,818 --> 02:24:57,061
The century is about to end.

1842
02:24:57,689 --> 02:25:01,102
We can't just sit like this.
We've do something!

1843
02:25:01,159 --> 02:25:02,866
We'll have to do something!

1844
02:25:05,730 --> 02:25:06,708
Baba! -Satya!

1845
02:25:07,965 --> 02:25:13,347
"Surge, swell Oh! mighty waves!
Smash,shatter as shackles do break"

1846
02:25:13,438 --> 02:25:21,755
"Surge, swell Oh! mighty waves!
Smash,shatter as shackles do break"

1847
02:25:27,852 --> 02:25:29,763
That woman in white,

1848
02:25:30,321 --> 02:25:31,959
and a few more men...

1849
02:25:32,056 --> 02:25:35,697
...pushed me into a small
room behind a door with iron grills.

1850
02:25:37,795 --> 02:25:39,468
A spark flashed in my brain,

1851
02:25:40,998 --> 02:25:43,842
I was a prisoner.

1852
02:25:50,908 --> 02:25:52,387
Khokon!

1853
02:25:54,746 --> 02:25:56,157
Suddenly...

1854
02:25:57,482 --> 02:26:00,019
...my Khokon came
and stood before me.

1855
02:26:02,453 --> 02:26:04,433
A blur at first

1856
02:26:05,757 --> 02:26:08,067
Then slowly he became the real.

1857
02:26:10,261 --> 02:26:12,764
How did he come in
through those grills ?

1858
02:26:13,364 --> 02:26:15,503
He walked in and stood before me,

1859
02:26:16,200 --> 02:26:17,508
smiling.

1860
02:26:18,503 --> 02:26:20,779
When did he learn to walk ?

1861
02:26:22,006 --> 02:26:24,247
My Khokon has learned to walk!

1862
02:26:29,080 --> 02:26:30,753
Suddenly...

1863
02:26:32,250 --> 02:26:34,787
...a thousand black snakes!

1864
02:26:35,887 --> 02:26:39,528
They started slithering
up allover my Khokon's body!

1865
02:26:40,191 --> 02:26:43,001
And the iron grills transformed...

1866
02:26:43,895 --> 02:26:50,073
...into a hundred
wriggling serpents!

1867
02:26:51,002 --> 02:26:52,242
And...

1868
02:26:52,870 --> 02:26:55,077
...and the lock!

1869
02:26:56,974 --> 02:26:59,921
The giant lock jangled into
the very face of Goddess Kali,

1870
02:27:00,444 --> 02:27:02,788
her tongue hanging out,

1871
02:27:03,414 --> 02:27:07,089
her weapon held high in the air.

1872
02:30:03,461 --> 02:30:04,735
Who's there ?

1873
02:30:06,230 --> 02:30:07,732
Again a?

1874
02:30:09,300 --> 02:30:10,711
Refugees again?

1875
02:30:12,403 --> 02:30:13,541
Who are you, my child ?

1876
02:30:14,572 --> 02:30:18,281
Have you come here losing your home,
your homeland, again?

1877
02:30:19,276 --> 02:30:21,552
Are you the vanished soul,
of my lost Bangladesh ?

1878
02:30:22,113 --> 02:30:22,716
Yes.

1879
02:30:24,181 --> 02:30:26,161
I hail from Bangladesh.

1880
02:30:27,284 --> 02:30:28,194
My name...

1881
02:30:28,652 --> 02:30:29,722
Bongobala

1882
02:30:41,532 --> 02:30:42,340
Where are you going ?
