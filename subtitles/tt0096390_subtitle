1
00:02:51,898 --> 00:02:58,201
Victory or defeat,
is not in your hands

2
00:02:58,905 --> 00:03:01,499
All you can do
is put up the fight

3
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:05,469
The battlefield
you are about to enter...

4
00:03:05,778 --> 00:03:09,145
lies not without.
lt lies within

5
00:03:09,582 --> 00:03:16,647
At every step you must fight, for the
truth, for justice, for your rights

6
00:03:16,923 --> 00:03:23,453
One thing you must remember.
Only in deed lies the victory

7
00:03:23,596 --> 00:03:26,224
All students here have received
their certificates

8
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:30,058
Giving the last award
is what is left

9
00:03:30,236 --> 00:03:39,338
The award to the outstanding student
for all-round performance

10
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:41,443
His name is...

11
00:03:41,714 --> 00:03:43,147
Vijay

12
00:03:58,498 --> 00:03:59,123
Grandpa

13
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:04,262
Success has been our legacy

14
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:36,300
Mummy, your blessing is what
made this possible

15
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:40,495
No son, it's the result
of your hard work

16
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:00,659
Let's go Mummy

17
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:20,004
Daddy, you promised
not to work today

18
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:23,173
Please take all this away

19
00:05:23,683 --> 00:05:28,017
Daddy, you promised
to take me to Goa today

20
00:05:28,688 --> 00:05:30,246
There are a few ends to be
taken care of. lf l leave now...

21
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:31,013
Hello Emperor

22
00:05:32,258 --> 00:05:33,225
May l come in?

23
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:34,893
Come on in, Gujral

24
00:05:35,094 --> 00:05:37,824
Yodhraj's doors are always
open for you

25
00:05:37,997 --> 00:05:42,696
For me, this is a great honour

26
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,530
l'm glad to see that Gujral has become
the biggest broker in the market

27
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:54,037
Don't you forget that it's with me
your good fortunes began

28
00:05:54,247 --> 00:05:56,374
You started out working for me.
- There's an old saying about...

29
00:05:56,682 --> 00:06:01,710
following in the footsteps of
the giant. Can l ever forget that?

30
00:06:01,921 --> 00:06:02,945
Not that you should

31
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,092
You can collect your cheque on account
of your commission from the accountant

32
00:06:10,363 --> 00:06:16,393
Never mind the commission.
lf l might share some profits...?

33
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:21,069
Understood. You want a part
of the lion's share

34
00:06:21,674 --> 00:06:26,668
But the lion likes to eat his prey.
- And you are the lion of lions

35
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,409
l am not asking for the lion's share.
Some from the leftovers, perhaps...?

36
00:06:31,651 --> 00:06:38,955
No Gujral. l don't share my profits
with outsiders

37
00:06:39,258 --> 00:06:42,227
Outsiders...?
- lf there's anything else...

38
00:06:42,395 --> 00:06:45,091
or if you need my help for anything,
make sure you tell me

39
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,163
All right, see you

40
00:06:53,973 --> 00:06:58,103
Daddy, why did you refuse to give
Uncle Gujral a partnership?

41
00:06:58,578 --> 00:07:04,107
My child, you don't wear your shoes
on your head

42
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:08,611
l'll never understand you.
Now hurry up...

43
00:07:08,821 --> 00:07:10,789
or someone else might barge in.
- Sir, did you ask for me?

44
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:15,789
Yes Mr Ajit. l hope you're ready.
You're coming to Goa with me today

45
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:18,795
On the way from the airport, we can
take a look at the plot for the hotel

46
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:57,062
Suman, come inside

47
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,920
Bela darling, am l mistaken, or
is he really Lala Yodhraj?

48
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:12,961
Yes, that's him. lt's been over
a year now. Were it someone else...

49
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:17,836
he would've come to accept it.
But he's Yodhraj

50
00:10:18,044 --> 00:10:19,841
He won't some to terms
with the times

51
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,981
Hello, Lalaji
- Hello Mehra, how are you?

52
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:29,014
Hi Bela, ho are you?
- Why are you sitting here all alone?

53
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,818
Haven't found company.
- You don't know how to make company

54
00:10:34,026 --> 00:10:36,654
You always put yourself
before everyone else

55
00:10:38,197 --> 00:10:40,995
You're just as humorous.
You haven't changed a bit

56
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:44,202
Nor have you.
You've shut yourself out

57
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:48,065
So tell me Mehra, how's business?

58
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:52,070
Raj, have you made up with Suman?

59
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,939
Daddy Surprise l've made it
l've become what you never could

60
00:10:59,151 --> 00:11:02,018
Shashi, you've no idea what
l could or couldn't become

61
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:05,884
Oh l know You can become a father,
a husband, but not what l've become

62
00:11:06,058 --> 00:11:09,152
That's because you haven't a sister.
l've become an uncle

63
00:11:12,465 --> 00:11:15,366
Suman has become a mother?
- Just the mother l'm the uncle

64
00:11:15,668 --> 00:11:17,863
lt's a boy.
- A grandson Congratulations

65
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,233
Congratulate me He's my nephew.
Daddy, l'm going to see my nephew

66
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:23,705
Are you coming?
- No son, you go ahead

67
00:11:28,414 --> 00:11:29,210
Yes Daddy?

68
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:34,047
Here's a gift for the baby.
From me

69
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:43,227
That's your character.
You miss your daughter

70
00:11:43,596 --> 00:11:46,565
You knew she's pregnant.You've even
been carrying a gift for the baby

71
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:49,664
But you won't make a truce with
your daughter and your son-in-law

72
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:54,729
And today, you even refuse
to see your grandson?

73
00:11:57,109 --> 00:12:01,739
Anyone from the family can
represent me. Shashi has gone

74
00:12:02,715 --> 00:12:06,310
My handsome, boy
My darling

75
00:12:07,787 --> 00:12:14,351
Look Master nephew, your only uncle is
here with your aunt-to-be to see you

76
00:12:16,462 --> 00:12:18,896
Congratulations
lt's a bonnie boy

77
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:21,827
And why not? He looks
just like his uncle

78
00:12:25,604 --> 00:12:29,438
Not the uncle. He looks
just like his father

79
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:35,544
Neither Shashi, nor you.
- Then whom does he resemble?

80
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:36,443
His grandfather

81
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:46,447
How is Daddy?
Oh l forgot

82
00:12:47,026 --> 00:12:49,051
Daddy sends this for your son

83
00:12:50,462 --> 00:12:54,125
See what your grandfather
has sent for you

84
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,434
He sends his love
in a gold coin

85
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:11,005
Yes sister?
Does Daddy think of me?

86
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:14,045
Could Daddy ever forget you?

87
00:13:14,987 --> 00:13:20,084
For hours, he sits in front
of your portrait in the study

88
00:13:22,394 --> 00:13:26,160
So how far has the romance progressed?

89
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:29,690
Upto the point of no-return

90
00:13:31,537 --> 00:13:33,334
Make sure you think it over
before taking the final step

91
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:35,336
What's there to think about?

92
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,070
You're the answer to every question
that Daddy can ever ask

93
00:13:38,344 --> 00:13:40,312
What you have done, l can do too

94
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,513
No, you may not. l will not accept
this marriage

95
00:13:47,152 --> 00:13:53,853
Daddy, l'm talking about my marriage.
l've the right to decide, haven't l?

96
00:13:54,093 --> 00:13:59,053
l have certain rights over you.
Do you refute that?

97
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,530
The son of such a big businessman may
not do anything without forethought

98
00:14:05,905 --> 00:14:10,865
Daddy, this isn't business.
This is a matter of the heart

99
00:14:11,277 --> 00:14:12,209
And the heart thinks not

100
00:14:18,384 --> 00:14:20,352
Kulkarni? From Poona?
Yes, go on

101
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:25,889
Yes, about that deal?
All right, l'm sending Shashi over

102
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:31,118
No, he's the one who will finalise
this deal. Yes, he's going over

103
00:14:40,272 --> 00:14:44,231
l'm sure you know the deal
l was talking about?

104
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:48,910
Daddy, l was talking about Rita.
- Look son... go over there...

105
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:53,718
strike the deal. Let's talk afterwards.
l need some time to think

106
00:14:55,788 --> 00:14:58,757
Daddy, we'll wait
for your decision

107
00:15:02,828 --> 00:15:05,797
The decision should be
in the affirmative

108
00:15:10,636 --> 00:15:11,933
What if he doesn't agree?
- How can he? He will agree

109
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:16,404
He's my father. l know him
l just have to play the field

110
00:15:16,575 --> 00:15:19,669
l'm going to Poona tomorrow.
The deal is tricky

111
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:21,472
A government official
holds the cards

112
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:24,945
l'll have to give him a good treat,
some scotch to pull off the deal

113
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,947
Daddy will be elated.
And we're through

114
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:31,089
l hope you pull it of soon enough

115
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,359
Why? ls someone else
propositioning you?

116
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,964
l'm pregnant

117
00:15:53,112 --> 00:15:54,306
Really?
Yes

118
00:16:03,022 --> 00:16:06,185
My first deal. l could do
with your blessings

119
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,523
You are a successful father's son.
Success is in your blood

120
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:14,255
Go, and have no doubt.
- l'll try to return after...

121
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:15,991
l've succeeded.
- You surely will

122
00:16:16,301 --> 00:16:19,099
Son, in this world,
success is everything

123
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:26,478
The man you're pitted against is
cunning, conniving and conceited

124
00:16:26,912 --> 00:16:27,776
Never forget that

125
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:32,510
Shashi, a gift for you

126
00:16:35,554 --> 00:16:36,578
With this pen,
l signed my first deal

127
00:16:37,322 --> 00:16:40,814
l want you to sign your first deal
with this pen

128
00:16:45,898 --> 00:16:46,523
Bless me, Daddy

129
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:58,203
Daddy, that's a fine jacket.
lt'd match my trousers

130
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,304
You like it?

131
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:06,182
When l wear it, l'll feel
as if you're with me

132
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,945
l'm always with you, son

133
00:17:18,864 --> 00:17:19,523
May l leave?

134
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:49,650
Take care of yourself.
You aren't alone now

135
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,097
Come back soon

136
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:34,969
l didn't want to discuss this
in Shashi's presence

137
00:18:37,342 --> 00:18:42,302
Now tell me, what kind of response
do you expect from me?

138
00:18:43,282 --> 00:18:46,479
That, which would make your son happy.

139
00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:48,786
And what about your wish?

140
00:18:50,956 --> 00:18:54,323
l'll be happy with that
which makes him happy

141
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:59,653
l didn't rear my son so that he'd
make me unhappy to make you happy

142
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,998
Surely l'm not to blame for that?

143
00:19:05,204 --> 00:19:06,501
l'm not accusing you

144
00:19:07,906 --> 00:19:13,037
But as a father, l have dreams
for my children, my family

145
00:19:16,248 --> 00:19:21,481
l've tried, but l do not see you
as part of my dreams

146
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:25,681
What of the dreams of others?

147
00:19:30,062 --> 00:19:33,554
Daydreams are gone no sooner
than you get out of the reverie

148
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,802
Shashi's child is no daydream.
lt's reality

149
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:46,867
So this is how far it has gone

150
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:50,809
My assumption was wrong

151
00:19:53,852 --> 00:19:58,812
For Shashi's antics, whatever they
may be, l'm responsible to make good

152
00:20:00,859 --> 00:20:05,819
This is my cheque. Once signed,
it's no less than legal tender

153
00:20:10,602 --> 00:20:16,507
Maybe you cannot even imagine what
it's worth, if it's a blank cheque

154
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:22,474
l want you to leave this city
before Shashi returns

155
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,912
Write up as much as you want

156
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:31,155
l cannot go anywhere before
l meet Shashi

157
00:20:32,557 --> 00:20:36,516
Then l might have to think
in terms of alternatives

158
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:49,939
''This is All lndia Radio''

159
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:55,503
''One of Lala Yodhraj's private planes
has met with an accident''

160
00:20:55,781 --> 00:20:58,773
''His son Shashiraj was
flying the aircraft''

161
00:22:11,723 --> 00:22:12,621

162
00:22:46,591 --> 00:22:48,718
''lf you can't count upto hundred''

163
00:22:49,094 --> 00:22:53,531
''Your money is gone''

164

''lf you have a dog that barks
The thief will never come in''

165
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:20,387
''You can eat to your heart's delight
While the monkeys keep watching''

166
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:32,431
''Set the dog after the monkey
The monkey will run away''

167
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:00,955
''lf Vicky is angry
with his mother''

00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:05,463
''He can always talk
to his uncle''

169
00:24:06,638 --> 00:24:07,468
Uncle? My uncle?

170
00:24:11,176 --> 00:24:14,145
What will my uncle say
to my grandpa?

171
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:15,971
Grandpa

172
00:24:18,517 --> 00:24:19,814
Grandpa will say,
''Grandpa is bad''

173
00:24:49,548 --> 00:24:54,508
Friends, time has run against me.
But one must go on living

174
00:24:55,887 --> 00:24:58,720
Circumstance has brought me
to the crossroads

175
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:07,054
Now l must take a new road.
And l know which road to take

176
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:11,192
l am sure you will stand beside me

177
00:25:14,205 --> 00:25:17,402
l have transferred all shares
belonging to my son Shashi...

178
00:25:17,709 --> 00:25:19,199
to my daughter Suman.
From today...

179
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:25,275
Suman Bhardwaj will be
the managing director

180
00:25:33,425 --> 00:25:38,385
Daddy, why did you do this?
- l've done what l felt best

181
00:25:39,197 --> 00:25:40,357
About Ajit's opinion...

182
00:25:51,209 --> 00:25:53,677
After Shashi, l have
only one hope left

183
00:25:53,878 --> 00:25:54,572
Vicky

184
00:25:55,747 --> 00:25:57,715
But Daddy...
- My child...

185
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:05,579
lf at a time like this,
you want to desert me... go on

186
00:26:12,497 --> 00:26:13,896
As it is, Shashi has left me

187
00:26:43,261 --> 00:26:48,631
What do l call you? Lala Yodhraj's
daughter... or Mrs Ajit Bhardwaj?

188
00:26:49,034 --> 00:26:52,470
Or rather, the managing director
of Yodhraj Enterprises?

189
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:55,297
What are you saying, Ajit?
- Would you rather that...

190
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,508
l become Mr Suman,
not Ajit Bhardwaj?

191
00:26:57,976 --> 00:27:01,503
So that people look up to you,
and l have to lose face?

192
00:27:02,781 --> 00:27:07,980
Was my love so cheap?
You sold me out for pennies?

193
00:27:08,553 --> 00:27:11,522
From being my wife, you've
become Yodhraj's daughter

194
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:15,658
When was l not Yodhraj's daughter?
- The wife was someone's daughter

195
00:27:15,827 --> 00:27:20,924
And now being daughter comes first?
- Before l became your wife, l was...

196
00:27:21,132 --> 00:27:25,330
someone's daughter, someone's sister,
and now, l'm someone's mother too.

197
00:27:26,137 --> 00:27:28,970
Sometimes relationships matter
more than love

198
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,973
Even your tenor has changed, Suman
- Don't you grieve my brother's death?

199
00:27:34,245 --> 00:27:37,214
My aging father will have to live
all alone. Do you not feel?

200
00:27:37,415 --> 00:27:40,145
His years of labour, all that
he has built, might be ruined

201
00:27:40,351 --> 00:27:42,376
Don't you have a heart?
- Having a heart doesn't mean...

202
00:27:42,554 --> 00:27:43,486
having to sell my pride

203
00:27:45,724 --> 00:27:50,684
The Managing directorship, or being
Ajit's wife? Decide. Here and now

204
00:27:51,896 --> 00:27:57,061
l did it when l married you.
- Marry me, you did

205
00:27:57,335 --> 00:28:00,862
But your father, you never forswore.
You did leave your father's house

206
00:28:01,072 --> 00:28:03,700
But not entirely

207
00:28:04,008 --> 00:28:07,808
Sit on two boats, and
you are doomed to drown

208
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:13,045
lf you wish to drown in that sea
of power and money, suit yourself

209
00:28:13,251 --> 00:28:16,709
But l'm not going to let my son drown.
l'm taking him away

210
00:28:17,122 --> 00:28:19,090
Don't you dare touch Vicky

211
00:28:20,024 --> 00:28:23,289
And no one dares raise his voice
in this house

212
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:26,027
No one can stop me from taking
my son with me

213
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:29,531
The mother's right overrides the
father's in the matter of a child

214
00:28:29,901 --> 00:28:31,732
And who decides that? You?

215
00:28:32,103 --> 00:28:34,401
The court will

216
00:28:34,706 --> 00:28:38,073
The court has heard both the sides

217
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:43,574
Emotions cannot direct
the course of the law

218
00:28:43,782 --> 00:28:48,412
None but the mother can take
better care of the child

219
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:54,758
The court has decided to let the
mother have custody over the child

220
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:01,832
We're home, Mummy

221
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:05,764
Vicky my boy, come in

222
00:29:05,937 --> 00:29:12,103
Now you will use your education and
expertise to manage Yodhraj lndustries

223
00:29:16,481 --> 00:29:19,609
Mr Dubey, what about that plot
on Victoria Road?

224
00:29:19,818 --> 00:29:23,413
Our efforts are on.
But there's a problem

225
00:29:26,357 --> 00:29:30,316
Mr Dubey, you receive your salaries
regularly

226
00:29:30,495 --> 00:29:36,593
Never have l complained of any
problems. Keep this in mind

227
00:29:37,502 --> 00:29:41,131
l want that plot at any cost

228
00:29:42,373 --> 00:29:44,136
This land is not for sale

229
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:52,107
This land may be just a strip.
But for me, it's the world

230
00:29:52,383 --> 00:29:57,343
The dreams of my family
are tied to this plot of land

231
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:59,750
That dream is the purpose of my life

232
00:30:01,726 --> 00:30:05,492
Don't you ever set foot
on this land again

233
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:15,072
Move it. Fast

234
00:30:23,381 --> 00:30:24,177
You...?

235
00:30:24,983 --> 00:30:31,684
All evening, l've had this itch

236
00:30:33,091 --> 00:30:37,187
Now that l've seen you,
l know why

237
00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:39,518
l'm Ujagar Singh

238
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:45,067
Barking dogs don't make lions run

239
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:52,372
Stealing is bad business. Maybe they
didn't tell you when you were a kid

240
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,540
l will have to tell you

241
00:32:24,102 --> 00:32:27,469
This is Ujagar Singh Our security
officer. Why have you trussed him up?

242
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:32,632
Daddy, he's the one who has been
robbing us. Today, l've caught him

243
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,639
Biting the hand that feeds him?

244
00:32:35,546 --> 00:32:36,843
Meena, call the police

245
00:32:47,191 --> 00:32:48,988
Mr Gujral, did you call us?

246
00:32:50,661 --> 00:32:56,622
lnspector, this is my security officer
caught red-handed by my son Arjun...

247
00:32:56,834 --> 00:33:01,498
stealing what he's supposed to protect.
You decide what to do with him

248
00:33:01,873 --> 00:33:05,001
How come you employed him? He's
a known criminal in these parts

249
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:09,777
Remember one thing.
Every sentence has a time frame

250
00:33:10,648 --> 00:33:17,315
You have stepped upon a snake.
The day l bite you, you'll be dead

251
00:33:17,655 --> 00:33:22,354
Let the government offer you
hospitality before that

252
00:34:05,103 --> 00:34:06,263
Angry with me?

253
00:34:06,704 --> 00:34:10,231
You know how long
l've been waiting?

254
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:14,740
Feels nice to know
someone is waiting

255
00:34:14,979 --> 00:34:16,276
Had you waited, you'd know

256
00:34:20,118 --> 00:34:23,918
Today's prize for waiting
... well let it wait

257
00:34:24,122 --> 00:34:25,248
Prize? Or bribe?

258
00:34:26,457 --> 00:34:27,389
My word

259
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:35,094
Vicky, why put a price to everything?
- Because everything has a price, love

260
00:34:52,917 --> 00:34:54,214
You're all salted

261
00:34:54,752 --> 00:34:57,243
Sweet at times, salty at times?

262
00:34:57,755 --> 00:35:01,054
Looks sweet. Tastes salty

263
00:35:01,826 --> 00:35:04,727
Am l your girlfriend, or
an advertisement for a biscuit?

264
00:35:05,029 --> 00:35:05,723
Biscuit...?

265
00:35:06,697 --> 00:35:11,794
Eat once, and you'd die
to eat it again and again

266
00:35:28,853 --> 00:35:34,291
Why is your heart pounding so hard?
- Not pounding. lt's saying something

267
00:35:34,525 --> 00:35:39,019
Saying what?
- Listen to it

268
00:35:41,732 --> 00:35:44,257
l don't get it.
You tell me

269
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:45,796
You don't get it?
- No

270
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:10,385
What happened?
Why has the lift stopped

271
00:36:10,761 --> 00:36:13,992
Hey, you're a girl
- So what?

272
00:36:14,832 --> 00:36:18,290
l'm a boy.
- So what am l supposed to do?

273
00:36:18,669 --> 00:36:20,534
How about doing something?

274
00:36:21,038 --> 00:36:22,005
What nonsense

275
00:36:22,907 --> 00:36:26,502
The lift is stuck, and it's dark.
Something ought to be done

276
00:36:26,777 --> 00:36:28,039
Why are you getting worked up?
We're helpless

277
00:36:28,246 --> 00:36:32,148
Will you shut up, please?
- Shutting up won't move the lift

278
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:36,514
We might get suffocated.
How about small talk?

279
00:36:36,721 --> 00:36:39,349
l'll tell you my name.
You tell me yours

280
00:36:39,523 --> 00:36:41,650
Let's exchange addresses,
and when do we meet next?

281
00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:44,589
What for? Why meet?
- Boy meets girl. After first sight...

282
00:36:44,795 --> 00:36:49,061
surely there's a second meeting?
- l don't want to see you ever again

283
00:36:49,433 --> 00:36:51,401
One must never decide in haste

284
00:36:52,536 --> 00:36:56,734
l'm scared of the darkness
Start the lift, l say

285
00:36:57,375 --> 00:36:58,899
How can l? l'm stuck with you

286
00:37:01,979 --> 00:37:05,915
Only one way to get over the scare.
Let's tell jokes

287
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,675
You are mad ls this
any place for joking?

288
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:11,251
Let me tell you a joke.
- l don't want to listen

289
00:37:11,422 --> 00:37:13,617
You have to do something
to while away the time

290
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:20,130
Chicago. The big city in America
l know l'm not a savage

291
00:37:20,498 --> 00:37:21,795
So you are listening

292
00:37:24,302 --> 00:37:27,135
The same thing happens over there.
Lift gets stuck

293
00:37:27,405 --> 00:37:31,364
What's so strange?
- Boy and girl inside the lift

294
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:33,333
Just like you and me.
- So what happened?

295
00:37:33,511 --> 00:37:36,674
As luck would have it,
the lift stays stuck for a year

296
00:37:36,881 --> 00:37:39,577
Nonsense Can a lift stay stuck
for a year?

297
00:37:39,784 --> 00:37:44,380
Anything is possible
And if this lift stays stuck...

298
00:37:44,588 --> 00:37:47,955
l'm afraid what happened there,
might happen here too

299
00:37:48,993 --> 00:37:51,791
The girl must've died.
- No After a year...

300
00:37:51,996 --> 00:37:54,931
when the lift started,
she came out

301
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:57,659
And there were three of them. Not two

302
00:38:03,808 --> 00:38:04,968
Thank you for your company

303
00:38:11,449 --> 00:38:14,418
What Sapna? No wish, no greeting?

304
00:38:16,487 --> 00:38:17,749
Are you all right?
- Yes

305
00:38:17,955 --> 00:38:22,915
ls Nisha there?
- She's expecting you

306
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,198
Parveen, a glass of water, please

307
00:38:33,971 --> 00:38:38,067
Some more time in that lift,
and l would've died

308
00:38:39,043 --> 00:38:43,002
Were you in the lift
when the lights went out?

309
00:38:46,517 --> 00:38:49,509
Alone?
A boy was there too

310
00:38:50,388 --> 00:38:52,686
Boy and girl. Shut
inside the lift

311
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,553
How was it?
Anything happened?

312
00:38:58,796 --> 00:39:04,029
You have a one-track mind.
- Love, you're pale

313
00:39:04,235 --> 00:39:08,831
And the dishevelled hair, the smeared
lipstick, the pounding heart...

314
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,038
Something surely happened...?

315
00:39:10,274 --> 00:39:13,368
You're always looking for excuses

316
00:39:20,718 --> 00:39:26,554
He was a scoundrel
Guess what he said?

317
00:39:26,924 --> 00:39:31,452
Said, now that we're stuck,
how about doing something?

318
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:33,057
Did you do something?

319
00:39:34,432 --> 00:39:36,491
Big trouble in the market.
What do we do?

320
00:39:36,801 --> 00:39:41,738
How am l concerned?
- But the prices have shot up

321
00:39:41,972 --> 00:39:45,408
So what. The deal isn't off.
l bought long from you

322
00:39:45,643 --> 00:39:49,739
How can l deliver at these prices?
That's what the trouble is about

323
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,005
Trouble? What do you mean trouble,
you treacherous fellow?

324
00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:52,979
Treacherous, you are

325
00:39:54,218 --> 00:39:56,015
You don't know how to talk?

326
00:39:58,222 --> 00:40:01,089
Next time l see you in this office,
l'll break your legs

327
00:40:01,325 --> 00:40:04,089
Daddy, why do you have to do business
with people like these?

328
00:40:04,428 --> 00:40:07,829
Hot-headed, isn't he?
l should be scared

329
00:40:10,267 --> 00:40:13,759
They take advances, then they don't
deliver, and they use foul language

330
00:40:13,971 --> 00:40:18,704
Don't mind my son, please
The salaries. Check it out

331
00:40:19,076 --> 00:40:26,642
Gujral, you asked for 200,000.
Count it. The balance is 2.5 million

332
00:40:26,884 --> 00:40:29,512
Count it first.
- You must've counted it already

333
00:40:29,753 --> 00:40:33,450
Don't trust anyone in money matters.
Not even your father

334
00:40:33,824 --> 00:40:36,452
ln business, you have to trust

335
00:40:37,094 --> 00:40:39,392
As long as money isn't involved

336
00:40:40,164 --> 00:40:42,997
Son, put the money in the bank

337
00:40:54,245 --> 00:41:00,150
l'll send in the papers tomorrow.
My regards to Lalaji

338
00:43:06,977 --> 00:43:10,037
Get them
And that one

339
00:43:11,982 --> 00:43:13,040
That one too. He's with them

340
00:43:14,918 --> 00:43:16,909
Don't let him get away
Yes, that one too

341
00:43:30,668 --> 00:43:31,635
My name is Vikram

342
00:43:32,269 --> 00:43:38,230
l don't think you know me.
But l'm a smart cat

343
00:43:38,776 --> 00:43:41,745
Till today, l was impressed
only with myself

344
00:43:42,012 --> 00:43:46,949
For the first time, someone else
has impressed me. You

345
00:43:47,851 --> 00:43:53,847
My name is Arjun. And l'm as impressed
with you as you are with yourself

346
00:43:54,091 --> 00:43:57,322
Smart you really are.
With you beside me...

347
00:43:57,528 --> 00:44:00,520
why just these clowns,
l could take on the whole city

348
00:44:01,298 --> 00:44:03,323
ls that so? ln that case,
l'm with you, always

349
00:44:03,567 --> 00:44:04,329
Let's shake hands

350
00:44:23,253 --> 00:44:26,017
Not hot, is it?
- No fun having it cold

351
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:38,563
What style

352
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:46,566
Lots of colour.
- All for your sake

353
00:44:49,346 --> 00:44:50,370
My sister, Meena

354
00:44:55,953 --> 00:44:56,920
May l...?
- Go on

355
00:45:00,958 --> 00:45:03,290
Yes, my brother said
it's a swimming party

356
00:45:04,094 --> 00:45:07,723
My girlfriend, Nisha
And this is my friend, Arjun

357
00:45:08,365 --> 00:45:12,062
There are some who are talked about
even before they arrive

358
00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:14,394
And some are talked about
even after they have left

359
00:45:15,272 --> 00:45:17,433
Have you come alone?
No girlfriends?

360
00:45:17,608 --> 00:45:20,304
Actually, girls are
allergic towards me

361
00:45:20,544 --> 00:45:21,476
And boys?

362
00:45:25,382 --> 00:45:29,409
There are lots of girls here.
lf you want my help, l could

363
00:45:29,586 --> 00:45:33,613
ln friendship and in love,
one takes no favours

364
00:45:40,564 --> 00:45:44,056
l'm so thirsty.
- l'll get you a cold drink

365
00:45:57,414 --> 00:45:59,905
What? Have you fallen down
from the skies? Come on

366
00:46:05,355 --> 00:46:07,323
Didn't you hear
what the lady said?

367
00:46:07,524 --> 00:46:11,620
And who are you? Her bodyguard?
l am your dad

368
00:46:19,102 --> 00:46:22,162
The two of you don't know each other.
This is Suresh Padampati

369
00:46:22,372 --> 00:46:26,604
And he is her brother.
Arjun Gujral

370
00:46:26,844 --> 00:46:32,805
Then you l owe to. Your dad
has done us quite a few favours

371
00:46:35,719 --> 00:46:40,588
l don't know you.
- You will, soon. We should meet

372
00:46:47,798 --> 00:46:50,995
What was he threatening me about?
Who was he?

373
00:46:51,201 --> 00:46:55,661
Padampati, the bankers. His father
is the one who committed suicide

374
00:46:55,873 --> 00:46:57,306
Quite a ruffian

375
00:47:03,614 --> 00:47:07,015
This is Arjun. And this is Sapna
Nice

376
00:47:08,285 --> 00:47:12,517
Hey, this is a lady
l was talking about daydreaming

377
00:47:20,364 --> 00:47:23,595
Boy meets girl. After first sight,
2surely there's a second meeting?

378
00:47:26,904 --> 00:47:30,806
As luck would have it,
the lift stays stuck for a year

379
00:47:31,108 --> 00:47:33,406
Nonsense Can a lift stay stuck
for a year?

380
00:47:33,677 --> 00:47:36,942
Anything is possible
And if this lift stays stuck...

381
00:47:37,147 --> 00:47:41,948
l'm afraid what happened there,
might happen here too

382
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:45,488
The girl must've died.
- No After a year...

383
00:47:45,689 --> 00:47:48,886
when the lift started,
she came out

384
00:47:49,192 --> 00:47:50,887
And there were three of them.
Not two

385
00:48:05,542 --> 00:48:09,205
Are you taking it out
on the fish?

386
00:48:11,715 --> 00:48:16,118
Should l rather take it out on you?
- l am at your disposal, sir

387
00:48:16,286 --> 00:48:19,585
Not you. l want Gujral

388
00:48:20,424 --> 00:48:23,985
The friend who betrayed.
lt was because of his deposition...

389
00:48:24,194 --> 00:48:30,929
that my father committed suicide.
Today l met his son

390
00:48:31,501 --> 00:48:39,931
And the story came back
l will avenge my father

391
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:43,370
l will force him to commit suicide

392
00:48:47,517 --> 00:48:49,610
Couldn't you sleep without me?

393
00:48:50,754 --> 00:48:56,283
Up so early?
l am. Still riding the lady?

394
00:48:56,393 --> 00:49:00,625
So, it's you? But what's wrong
with riding ladies, my love?

395
00:49:00,931 --> 00:49:03,832
My love? Who are you talking to?
ls there anyone else over there?

396
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:10,165
No one else. What are you doing?
- Calisthenics. Heads down, legs up

397
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:14,709
Heads down... legs up?
- Heads down... legs up? Are you mad?

398
00:49:15,145 --> 00:49:20,981
l'm in the whirlpool
ln the bathtub? Without me?

399
00:49:22,285 --> 00:49:24,981
ln he bathtub? Vicky, are you mad?

400
00:49:26,023 --> 00:49:26,955
Just a bit romantic

401
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:31,993
Vicky, who are you romancing?
Who's the girl over there?

402
00:49:32,162 --> 00:49:36,656
Who can it be but you, Nisha darling?
After you, it's time to pack up

403
00:49:36,867 --> 00:49:40,496
What's wrong with you
up in the morning?

404
00:49:40,704 --> 00:49:42,535
Wait. l'll talk to you later.
Hold on

405
00:49:42,706 --> 00:49:44,003
Whom are you asking to wait?

406
00:49:44,207 --> 00:49:46,539
Nisha darling, some trouble with
the lines

407
00:49:51,548 --> 00:49:55,746
l had called up to thank you.
Great party

408
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:58,644
And the people you invited
were great

409
00:49:59,322 --> 00:50:05,022
Stay with me, and you'll enjoy life.
Come to the point. Who's she? Sapna?

410
00:50:05,962 --> 00:50:10,422
She's hot

411
00:50:10,734 --> 00:50:11,598
l like your choice

412
00:50:12,402 --> 00:50:14,529
Can you believe this?
l didn't talk to her...

413
00:50:14,704 --> 00:50:16,137
l didn't ask for her address,
l didn't ask her telephone number

414
00:50:16,306 --> 00:50:19,469
Now how am l going to see her?
- l'll fix you a meeting

415
00:50:19,676 --> 00:50:22,975
l'll make your life. By the way,
what's your programme this weekend?

416
00:50:23,246 --> 00:50:25,646
How about going for a picnic?

417
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:26,816
Picnic? Me? All right

418
00:50:27,084 --> 00:50:32,351
l can't refuse you.
For your sake, anything

419
00:50:32,622 --> 00:50:36,114
We'll take Nisha along
And of course, your hot... Sapna too

420
00:50:41,598 --> 00:50:44,396
What happened?
- Tell me, where's that girl?

421
00:51:26,143 --> 00:51:27,770
''Walk over the clouds''

422
00:51:30,814 --> 00:51:32,975
''Traipse down the raindrops''

423
00:51:44,728 --> 00:51:48,721
''ln my breath, in my arms
l hold you''

424
00:52:54,231 --> 00:52:58,429
''The greens have touched
the boughs''

425
00:52:58,702 --> 00:53:02,069
''The clouds rain down
the silver''

426
00:53:17,254 --> 00:53:18,744
''lt's a wet wet season''

427
00:53:21,891 --> 00:53:25,884
''Careful when you traipse
into my heart

428
00:54:02,699 --> 00:54:06,931
''l am the earth
You are the skies''

429
00:54:07,971 --> 00:54:12,931
''You l desire
You are the one l love''

430
00:54:16,613 --> 00:54:20,606
''Like the bow the body bends
when l stretch''

431
00:54:20,984 --> 00:54:25,284
''For you to gather
in your arms''

432
00:54:35,465 --> 00:54:39,492
''When the turbulence
hits the veil''

433
00:54:39,736 --> 00:54:41,499
''Like a poem, come to my lips''

434
00:55:16,373 --> 00:55:20,275
''Like beads of water
on fragile glass''

435
00:55:21,244 --> 00:55:26,204
''The nights when hesitant eyebrows
are downcast''

436
00:55:39,763 --> 00:55:43,199
''Like dark clouds my tresses''

437
00:55:44,334 --> 00:55:49,033
''Come to me, like the spirits
that intoxicate''

438
00:57:17,827 --> 00:57:21,627
Get out of my way.
- Suresh Padampati never stops anyone

439
00:57:21,931 --> 00:57:23,558
For myself, l make way

440
00:57:25,101 --> 00:57:29,663
Darling, youth is blind, l know
But not blind enough...

441
00:57:29,939 --> 00:57:33,568
not to notice a six foot tall man
standing right in front of you

442
00:57:33,943 --> 00:57:36,969
Let go l don't like
this hooliganism a bit

443
00:57:37,514 --> 00:57:40,483
Not hooliganism, darling.
Sheer impulse

444
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:44,811
After that hot steam bath
... this mad fever

445
00:57:45,188 --> 00:57:46,155
And the season... it's hot too

446
00:57:46,356 --> 00:57:51,157
l hope we don't end up burnt out
without any action

447
00:58:10,547 --> 00:58:12,242
Brother

448
00:58:14,651 --> 00:58:20,521
The next time you tease my sister
... l'll kill you

449
00:58:20,823 --> 00:58:21,653
Son of a bitch

450
00:58:21,891 --> 00:58:28,990
This is a dangerous game you've
started. l'll play the endgame

451
00:58:36,873 --> 00:58:40,809
Enjoying themselves...
and in a pretty romantic mood

452
00:58:43,713 --> 00:58:47,877
They look elated.
- Not for long now

453
00:58:50,687 --> 00:58:54,054
Biloo, careful.
- Don't worry

454
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:57,088
On jobs like these,
being careful is my forte

455
00:58:57,427 --> 00:58:58,416
One minute

456
00:59:07,136 --> 00:59:09,570
Maybe you needn't take
the trouble at all

457
00:59:09,939 --> 00:59:13,102
Looks like he has struck up
a feud with someone else too

458
00:59:38,801 --> 00:59:40,166
One large whisky

459
00:59:40,536 --> 00:59:43,266
Are you kidding?
Boss has warned me...

460
00:59:43,473 --> 00:59:45,498
against giving you even a glass
of plain water on credit

461
00:59:45,742 --> 00:59:47,937
What's my balance?
- Only 3500

462
00:59:50,313 --> 00:59:54,215
Keep that
Settle all his accounts

463
00:59:54,717 --> 00:59:56,981
Get two bottles of whisky.
Black Label

464
00:59:59,155 --> 01:00:02,147
Who are you?
- Suresh Padampati

465
01:00:02,759 --> 01:00:05,785
Your motive behind this favour?
- Arjun Gujral

466
01:00:05,995 --> 01:00:07,292
Our mutual enemy

467
01:00:14,771 --> 01:00:19,731
You missed your target,
but l didn't miss you

468
01:00:21,744 --> 01:00:25,510
You're a useful fellow.
What's your name?

469
01:00:25,748 --> 01:00:26,942
Ujagar Singh

470
01:00:28,985 --> 01:00:34,514
l can give my life for you
- lf the need arises, l'll take it

471
01:00:35,558 --> 01:00:37,321
l'm the best of friends

472
01:00:38,561 --> 01:00:44,761
As long as the glass is on this table,
and as long as we are sitting here

473
01:00:45,034 --> 01:00:46,331
the whisky will keep coming. Okay?

474
01:00:48,705 --> 01:00:50,673
When two friends shake hands...

475
01:00:50,873 --> 01:00:55,401
the days are numbered
for the enemy

476
01:00:56,179 --> 01:00:58,670
Gorgeous Whose office
is this, Grandpa?

477
01:00:59,482 --> 01:01:04,078
The new managing director's
New managing director...?

478
01:01:04,387 --> 01:01:08,915
But Mummy is the managing director
- l was. But, not anymore

479
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:14,027
Then, who is it?
You

480
01:01:15,832 --> 01:01:16,890
Me...?

481
01:01:17,266 --> 01:01:21,532
Yes. From this day, you're
the managing director

482
01:01:26,008 --> 01:01:30,911
Do you have faith in me?
My decisions are never wrong, Vicky

483
01:01:31,681 --> 01:01:36,948
Daddy has waited for this day.
Now, you have to prove your caliber

484
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:39,617
Grandpa

485
01:01:41,891 --> 01:01:45,383
One who has Grandpa's blessings
is bound to succeed

486
01:01:46,529 --> 01:01:51,398
Bravo Just what l had wanted
to hear from you

487
01:01:51,701 --> 01:01:55,398
l want to make you a gift.
Make a wish

488
01:01:58,007 --> 01:02:00,942
Really? Will you grant me
whatever l wish for?

489
01:02:01,177 --> 01:02:04,635
Sure. Go ahead.
Ask for the most priceless

490
01:02:05,848 --> 01:02:08,146
l want a private, personal, airplane

491
01:02:13,055 --> 01:02:13,885
No

492
01:02:21,464 --> 01:02:24,433
No, Vicky Not a private aircraft

493
01:02:32,141 --> 01:02:32,903
No way

494
01:02:45,521 --> 01:02:49,958
Son, not appealing enough.
A hotel should be designed...

495
01:02:50,092 --> 01:02:51,286
to set imaginations on fire

496
01:02:51,494 --> 01:02:53,325
Daddy, what do you have in mind?

497
01:02:53,529 --> 01:02:57,295
That's the hitch. How do l spell
it out? l'm not educated like you

498
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,468
But if l see what l imagine,
l'd tell you that's it

499
01:03:00,636 --> 01:03:04,470
l can't read your mind, can l?
- True, too

500
01:03:05,474 --> 01:03:09,467
There's one man... but l don't know
whether he will agree

501
01:03:09,712 --> 01:03:12,340
lf we pay him for it, why won't he?
- He's moody

502
01:03:12,615 --> 01:03:15,482
lf he wilts, he'd do it for free.
lf not, he won't. Not at any cost

503
01:03:15,718 --> 01:03:16,377
Who is he?

504
01:03:30,199 --> 01:03:31,496
People say you're a genius

505
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:36,538
They are right

506
01:03:41,611 --> 01:03:46,844
l have business with you
Will you work for me?

507
01:03:50,386 --> 01:03:51,011
No

508
01:03:52,288 --> 01:03:55,451
Because, what can you offer me
but money?

509
01:03:57,226 --> 01:03:58,193
Gentleman, 25 years ago...

510
01:03:58,361 --> 01:04:07,565
l gave up more money
than you can ever imagine

511
01:04:09,372 --> 01:04:12,535
Money bites. Money destroys
the bond of love

512
01:04:12,742 --> 01:04:19,875
l hate money. With money,
l've had this long-standing feud

513
01:04:23,786 --> 01:04:28,223
Among friends, one raises cheer
With friends, one shares a drink

514
01:04:29,191 --> 01:04:30,886
May l consider you a friend?

515
01:04:49,245 --> 01:04:51,076
A friend's enemy
can never be your friend

516
01:04:51,247 --> 01:04:52,908
Whom do you consider an enemy?

517
01:04:53,816 --> 01:04:58,583
The one who might intrude upon
our relationship in the future

518
01:04:59,021 --> 01:04:59,988
Who might intrude upon our friendship?

519
01:05:01,257 --> 01:05:03,748
The one who must not
stand between us

520
01:05:04,193 --> 01:05:05,285
Who is this man?

521
01:05:09,632 --> 01:05:14,365
Some people loathe my very name.
ln this city, they are the big shots

522
01:05:14,737 --> 01:05:17,604
Before you take a decision, think

523
01:05:17,974 --> 01:05:20,499
Mr Ajit, l am a humble man...
but, l take my own decisions

524
01:05:34,757 --> 01:05:37,248
Arjun, l think you don't want
to maintain our friendship

525
01:05:37,593 --> 01:05:40,118
Finding a friend was very tough.
How can l forsake a friend?

526
01:05:40,329 --> 01:05:45,198
Then why do you do what l dislike?
l told you about Ajit Bhardwaj...?

527
01:05:45,401 --> 01:05:50,395
Why do you hate Ajit Bhardwaj?
- Forget him. l care for you

528
01:05:50,606 --> 01:05:53,769
You are my friend.
l don't want you to lose money

529
01:05:53,943 --> 01:05:57,276
How come you've entrusted a drunkard
with such a big project?

530
01:05:57,546 --> 01:05:59,844
Whether he boozes or does whatever
else... that is his personal affair

531
01:06:00,149 --> 01:06:04,984
He has other personal affairs too.
Are you aware of that?

532
01:06:05,154 --> 01:06:08,282
Was his wife to blame
because she loved him?

533
01:06:08,557 --> 01:06:12,516
She was someone's daughter,
someone's sister, someone's mother...

534
01:06:12,762 --> 01:06:16,664
but he abandoned her. ls his son
to blame because he had a right...

535
01:06:16,832 --> 01:06:18,993
to his father's love... that,
which he was deprived of

536
01:06:19,702 --> 01:06:21,795
ls his father-in-law
to blame because...

537
01:06:21,971 --> 01:06:25,338
he regarded him as his son,
after his son died?

538
01:06:25,508 --> 01:06:27,339
He even wanted to give him
all his wealth

539
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:29,910
But in his arrogance, his egotism,
he spurned everything

540
01:06:30,179 --> 01:06:32,670
And today... he blames everyone,
but himself

541
01:06:32,882 --> 01:06:34,349
And he drowns himself day and night
in liquor

542
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:36,015
How do you know all this?

543
01:06:42,124 --> 01:06:44,024
Because... he is my father

544
01:06:55,204 --> 01:06:57,695
Can't you even reverse a car?
You crash my car, and you laugh?

545
01:06:57,907 --> 01:07:01,035
There was someone else on my mind.
- ln that case, don't drive

546
01:07:04,747 --> 01:07:09,707
Sorry won't repair my car, will it?
- l said, l'm sorry

547
01:07:10,953 --> 01:07:11,715
Drive carefully

548
01:07:36,946 --> 01:07:41,747
My mistake too. l crashed into you too

549
01:07:53,896 --> 01:07:57,457
What does Arjun think of himself?
He doesn't even talk properly

550
01:07:57,733 --> 01:07:59,963
Why did you have to apologise?

551
01:08:02,972 --> 01:08:04,769
Nisha, even l was at fault

552
01:08:08,244 --> 01:08:11,441
l shouldn't have involved
business with friendship

553
01:08:14,016 --> 01:08:17,042
lt's not right to mix
business with friendship

554
01:08:17,686 --> 01:08:20,416
Vicky shouldn't have flared up
over something so trivial

555
01:08:20,623 --> 01:08:27,529
lt happens sometimes. Sometimes
you vent your ire on someone else

556
01:08:27,930 --> 01:08:32,799
You might not feel it.
But l felt very bad

557
01:08:33,335 --> 01:08:36,361
So tell me, what would you like?

558
01:08:36,605 --> 01:08:40,735
Like?
ls there anything likable?

559
01:08:41,944 --> 01:08:46,005
Don't ask me.
l like so many things

560
01:08:49,018 --> 01:08:53,148
l'm asking you.
- l'll tell you later

561
01:08:53,489 --> 01:08:55,457
First, you tell me

562
01:08:57,459 --> 01:09:00,485
lf l did, you'd feel bad about it

563
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:03,027
Out with it. l'll face it

564
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:13,508
l'd like to make love to you

565
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:18,840
Who's stopping you?

566
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:51,602
You are so hot
You are sensuous

567
01:09:52,348 --> 01:09:53,474
You're so brazen

568
01:09:57,052 --> 01:10:00,818
Don't hold back, Sapna
Leave me, please

569
01:10:02,925 --> 01:10:06,417
You are choking me...
spare me a breath

570
01:10:26,148 --> 01:10:26,910
Stop

571
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:45,992
Who was that?

572
01:10:49,772 --> 01:10:52,741
When hero romances heroine,
who pops up?

573
01:10:52,841 --> 01:10:53,603
Villain

574
01:10:54,376 --> 01:10:57,174
Careful with that
You are right. He is the villain

575
01:10:57,579 --> 01:10:59,547
Poor boy My hero is injured

576
01:11:07,323 --> 01:11:08,153
Here

577
01:11:10,392 --> 01:11:13,293
A few more punches,
and he would've made my day

578
01:11:15,798 --> 01:11:18,892
Shall l make your day?
- Who's stopping you?

579
01:11:27,042 --> 01:11:33,208
l think we have a full quorum.
Shall we proceed with the meeting?

580
01:11:33,349 --> 01:11:38,309
A few more moments, sir.
We are expecting Mr Gujral

581
01:11:43,892 --> 01:11:45,860
l apologise for being late

582
01:11:46,295 --> 01:11:51,995
l'm Ajit Bhardwaj.
l'm representing Gujral Enterprises

583
01:12:09,284 --> 01:12:14,221
Had l wished to shake hands with you,
l would've done it 25 years ago

584
01:12:17,593 --> 01:12:22,360
l can't stay here any longer.
Please forgive me

585
01:12:35,811 --> 01:12:40,771
Audacity How can Ajit stand up to you?
Uncle, this is a conspiracy against you

586
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:45,509
Ajit has been appointed
to humiliate you

587
01:12:45,954 --> 01:12:51,392
What makes them, father and son,
so proud? Just a strip of land?

588
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:54,529
Uncle, time was when you
ruled the roost

589
01:12:54,730 --> 01:12:59,497
Your enemies would opt out of projects
that you took up

590
01:13:00,102 --> 01:13:05,267
But times have changed.
People have started challenging you

591
01:13:07,176 --> 01:13:10,270
Vultures fly closer as the lion ages

592
01:13:19,054 --> 01:13:22,421
And there's an adage
you haven't heard of

593
01:13:22,691 --> 01:13:26,752
The tiger becomes ferocious
once it is wounded

594
01:13:29,698 --> 01:13:31,666
When you were a nobody, you used
to beg Yodhraj for favours

595
01:13:31,834 --> 01:13:33,961
You think you've become big enough
to throw your weight around?

596
01:13:34,203 --> 01:13:35,761
Have you forgotten how much
you are obliged to him?

597
01:13:36,071 --> 01:13:37,766
There are no obligations

598
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:43,109
ln today's times, one who
isn't profitable is kicked out

599
01:13:43,345 --> 01:13:46,109
Besides, my father has done enough
for Mr Yodhraj

600
01:13:46,281 --> 01:13:49,546
He has taken more than he has given.
And he is still offering more

601
01:13:49,751 --> 01:13:51,981
He's offering a hundred times
the price you paid for that plot

602
01:13:52,154 --> 01:13:54,816
And he is doing no favours.
This is the value of real estate

603
01:13:55,090 --> 01:13:57,058
lf we sell, we ought to get more

604
01:13:57,526 --> 01:14:02,486
Son, Mr Yodhraj has done a lot
for me. We have to give an answer

605
01:14:03,832 --> 01:14:05,459
The answer is, sell the land

606
01:14:05,801 --> 01:14:09,134
There's more profit
in building the hotel

607
01:14:09,304 --> 01:14:13,798
Just book profits. There offer
is for 5 million. Just pick it up

608
01:14:14,142 --> 01:14:17,634
Are you trying to lure us?
- Am l luring?

609
01:14:18,013 --> 01:14:21,676
Have you ever seen
5 million in cash?

610
01:14:21,917 --> 01:14:28,186
Even if you and your Dad sit counting,
you won't be through in a day's time

611
01:14:29,224 --> 01:14:33,183
Then we must show you how to count

612
01:14:36,732 --> 01:14:38,791
You expect us to bow under pressure?

613
01:14:41,303 --> 01:14:46,172
The hotel is our dream.
Our dreams we will never sell

614
01:14:47,409 --> 01:14:51,368
Welcome Mr Gujral.
l have been expecting you

615
01:14:52,714 --> 01:14:57,777
How come the Emperor steps down from
his throne to welcome a pauper?

616
01:14:58,153 --> 01:15:02,817
lt's my duty to welcome a guest.
- Your wish is my command

617
01:15:03,191 --> 01:15:04,351
Business goes on, Mr Gujral

618
01:15:04,726 --> 01:15:10,528
But l'd rather we shared
the bonhomie of yore

619
01:15:10,832 --> 01:15:15,701
l'd like that too. But what can l do?
Arjun is adamant about the hotel

620
01:15:16,171 --> 01:15:21,541
Why break his heart? You take a step
forward, and l take a step too

621
01:15:21,843 --> 01:15:25,540
Besides, Vicky and Arjun
have been friends for years

622
01:15:25,781 --> 01:15:28,545
lt'd be difficult to compromise
about the hotel

623
01:15:28,917 --> 01:15:32,876
How about me financing the project?
You keep owning the land

624
01:15:33,088 --> 01:15:37,855
How about a partnership?
You and l would both own the hotel

625
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:41,959
What little l have learnt,
l have learnt from you

626
01:15:42,197 --> 01:15:46,156
l do not give partnerships
to outsiders

627
01:15:53,208 --> 01:15:55,176
lf this is your principle too,
then very well

628
01:16:00,215 --> 01:16:01,182
Blood?

629
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:09,457
Not to worry

630
01:16:12,227 --> 01:16:13,592
lt will not go waste

631
01:16:24,506 --> 01:16:25,803
Why isn't Mr Mehra here?

632
01:16:26,842 --> 01:16:30,278
l don't know. l haven't seen him
in sometime

633
01:16:32,314 --> 01:16:34,612
What's this about?
-Mr lndersen Gujral...?

634
01:16:35,384 --> 01:16:37,284
l am. Yes, what is it?

635
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,881
You may not carry out any construction
on this plot. Court's orders

636
01:16:42,057 --> 01:16:46,892
Who has brought this injunction?
- Lala Yodhraj Bhalla

637
01:16:47,929 --> 01:16:48,896
Come on, son

638
01:16:49,865 --> 01:16:53,232
What do you want?
- What can you give anyone?

639
01:16:53,802 --> 01:16:56,930
All you know is how to snatch
From friends and family

640
01:16:57,172 --> 01:17:01,632
And l addressed you as the Emperor
What a waste l regret it

641
01:17:01,943 --> 01:17:03,570
Hold your tongue, Gujral

642
01:17:04,112 --> 01:17:08,173
We are from the times when
etiquette mattered more

643
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:13,319
l saw you build your empire
brick by brick. And l rejoiced

644
01:17:14,222 --> 01:17:19,182
Now you won't even let me lay my first
brick You send me an injunction?

645
01:17:21,697 --> 01:17:26,657
This allegation you should level
against Mehra. Not against me

646
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:30,335
Why are you venting the ire on me?

647
01:17:30,505 --> 01:17:34,771
Am l not entitled to my money?
- l have never taken money from you

648
01:17:36,545 --> 01:17:38,979
But you have taken from Mehra.
- Yes, l have taken

649
01:17:39,214 --> 01:17:41,978
And you signed promissory notes?
- Yes, l did

650
01:17:42,217 --> 01:17:45,186
Mehra needed the money.
He couldn't recover from you

651
01:17:45,387 --> 01:17:49,084
So he sold me the promissory notes.
Now l have to recover from you

652
01:17:49,324 --> 01:17:54,023
Excuse me, Mehra never needed
the money. You needed that land

653
01:17:54,262 --> 01:17:56,696
Mehra hasn't sold you the promissory
notes. You bought him out

654
01:17:56,865 --> 01:17:59,129
Mind your manners, young man

655
01:17:59,334 --> 01:18:03,532
Daddy, he's the Emperor who feels
slighted at being refused what he asks

656
01:18:03,739 --> 01:18:10,042
He asks for land, and we refuse.
And he feels slighted

657
01:18:10,345 --> 01:18:13,314
Unless you pander to the whims
of these, the high and mighty...

658
01:18:13,515 --> 01:18:16,450
they will send you notices,
they will drag you to court...

659
01:18:16,618 --> 01:18:17,846
they will send you to jail
- My boy...

660
01:18:18,019 --> 01:18:19,714
Not land, this is battle
is about principles

661
01:18:19,988 --> 01:18:24,652
We retain Ajit, he became jealous.
We refuse him, and he loses his head

662
01:18:24,893 --> 01:18:26,918
Not the land, he wants to buy us out

663
01:18:28,930 --> 01:18:31,865
God has given you everything Vicky.
Everything, but principles

664
01:18:32,033 --> 01:18:34,661
How could you play so dirty
for a piece of land?

665
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:39,031
You're asked to pay back what you owe,
and you take to the streets?

666
01:18:39,307 --> 01:18:43,403
Not what l owe... what l owe
to the traitor

667
01:18:43,645 --> 01:18:48,605
So the truth is bitter?
Hurts, does it?

668
01:18:50,685 --> 01:18:54,746
Another word, and
l'll break your face

669
01:18:54,956 --> 01:18:59,757
High and mighty you might be.
But you are such lowly creatures

670
01:18:59,928 --> 01:19:02,192
Will you start a war
over something as trivial?

671
01:19:02,397 --> 01:19:05,764
lf you consider this a war,
then war it is

672
01:19:05,934 --> 01:19:08,767
On the battlefield, neither
would l turn my back

673
01:19:08,937 --> 01:19:10,996
But on condition that l get to fight
someone who is man enough

674
01:19:11,273 --> 01:19:15,334
Arjun, you are crossing your limits.
- Your limits l know very well

675
01:19:15,544 --> 01:19:18,012
You are even ashamed to accept
your own father

676
01:19:47,642 --> 01:19:49,610
''Your eyes are mine''

677
01:20:00,589 --> 01:20:02,557
''Make me weep if you want''

678
01:20:07,329 --> 01:20:10,298
''My heart is yours to keep''

679
01:20:20,542 --> 01:20:22,510
''Share your sorrows with me''

680
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:52,162
''lf you are morose,
l shall find no happiness''

681
01:20:55,777 --> 01:20:56,744
''Why are you looking so lost?''

682
01:21:17,232 --> 01:21:19,894
''Let my lips smile for you''

683
01:21:44,559 --> 01:21:50,054
''So what if the path is dark?''

684
01:21:51,166 --> 01:21:53,259
''l am holding your hands''

685
01:22:12,854 --> 01:22:15,823
''l will be your lamp
Light me''

686
01:22:25,533 --> 01:22:26,363
Were you sleeping?

687
01:22:27,602 --> 01:22:29,502
No, l was awake

688
01:22:30,005 --> 01:22:31,370
Are you coming today?
- Yes

689
01:22:31,606 --> 01:22:33,574
At what time?
''-Eleven''

690
01:22:39,347 --> 01:22:46,515
We used to go hang out together.
lt was so much fun

691
01:22:47,422 --> 01:22:50,653
For nothing, Vicky and Arjun
have picked up this fight

692
01:22:50,892 --> 01:22:55,261
Arjun is taking this too far.
He shouldn't have insulted Grandpa

693
01:22:56,031 --> 01:22:58,591
Look, don't you take sides
with your boyfriend

694
01:22:58,767 --> 01:23:01,930
Vicky is as much at fault.
- Why can't he be annoyed...

695
01:23:02,170 --> 01:23:06,004
if Arjun insults his grandpa?
- And what a friend has Vicky been

696
01:23:06,307 --> 01:23:09,208
They were performing the inaugural
rites when Vicky sent that notice

697
01:23:09,444 --> 01:23:12,936
Should he rather have used those
promissory notes to impound the land?

698
01:23:15,650 --> 01:23:18,676
Your father is in league with Lalaji
He sold the promissory notes

699
01:23:20,055 --> 01:23:24,788
Don't you drag my Daddy into this.
- Why not? He's the root cause

700
01:23:27,328 --> 01:23:30,559
lf you utter another word
against my Daddy...

701
01:23:30,732 --> 01:23:33,860
l won't see your face ever again
- Who wants to look at your face?

702
01:23:42,410 --> 01:23:44,037
Yes Khatri, what is the matter?

703
01:23:44,345 --> 01:23:47,872
l have bad news.
- What happened?

704
01:23:48,216 --> 01:23:50,309
Lala Yodhraj's lawyer
has sent this notice

705
01:23:50,618 --> 01:23:53,883
Unless his client is repaid
in three months...

706
01:23:54,089 --> 01:23:57,456
they will seek to liquidate us.
- l knew

707
01:23:58,359 --> 01:24:00,657
Someday Lala Yodhraj would do
just this

708
01:24:08,369 --> 01:24:12,328
Wasn't stalling the hotel enough?
Now you send me a liquidation notice?

709
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:13,971
What else am l to do,
if you refuse to pay me?

710
01:24:14,309 --> 01:24:17,745
l'm not talking money, Emperor
You want to strip me naked

711
01:24:18,179 --> 01:24:20,670
ln market parlance, one who cannot
repay his debts is called naked

712
01:24:20,949 --> 01:24:23,247
You insult me, and you expect me
to take care of your clothes?

713
01:24:23,451 --> 01:24:24,349
Never

714
01:24:24,652 --> 01:24:26,620
There's an old saying, Lalaji

715
01:24:27,388 --> 01:24:30,084
Rouse the cat, and it will scratch out
a tiger's eyes

716
01:24:30,291 --> 01:24:32,088
Do not trespass your limits, Gujral

717
01:24:32,393 --> 01:24:36,090
lf you try to strip me,
you will not wear clothes either

718
01:24:36,331 --> 01:24:40,097
For you, l have done a thousand sins.
The skeletons in your closet...

719
01:24:40,268 --> 01:24:43,704
the dead over whom you have erected
your palaces... l know it all

720
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:49,099
That story about the hotel in Goa.
l know The old woman you bought out...

721
01:24:49,344 --> 01:24:53,371
died begging on the streets
The loads of forged documents...

722
01:24:53,681 --> 01:24:57,777
the officials involved... the ones who
were bribed... l know all about it

723
01:24:58,019 --> 01:24:59,509
l belong to your past

724
01:25:00,155 --> 01:25:02,783
lf mine is a glass house
... then yours is too

725
01:25:03,158 --> 01:25:06,457
The shards from my broken house
will surely fall upon yours

726
01:25:08,563 --> 01:25:13,865
Lala, l even know your family.
Your father was a corrupt official

727
01:25:14,169 --> 01:25:20,802
He'd even pick up coins from shit
l even know all your ancestors

728
01:25:21,176 --> 01:25:24,145
Thieves Traitors Opportunists

729
01:25:24,712 --> 01:25:28,079
You may have raised yourself to
a position from where...

730
01:25:28,316 --> 01:25:31,149
all you survey looks insignificant.
But l am not as insignificant...

731
01:25:31,319 --> 01:25:34,413
as you presume
- Scoundrel l'm going to kill you

732
01:25:39,027 --> 01:25:41,689
You think you stand so tall?
Have you forgotten that...

733
01:25:41,863 --> 01:25:44,161
your father was a clerk serving me?
He'd cringe before me

734
01:25:44,465 --> 01:25:46,990
He'd say, please do something
for my son l promoted you

735
01:25:47,202 --> 01:25:50,171
From clerk to commission agent
When you started out in business...

736
01:25:50,405 --> 01:25:53,169
l was the one who invested
When you were building your house...

737
01:25:53,341 --> 01:25:56,504
it was l, who gave you money
l even paid for your wedding

738
01:25:56,811 --> 01:26:00,508
On my handouts, you have prospered
And today, you are a man of esteem?

739
01:26:00,682 --> 01:26:04,448
You dare scratch out my eyes?
You dare stone my house?

740
01:26:05,086 --> 01:26:09,022
lt takes a man of steel
to abuse Yodhraj

741
01:26:09,224 --> 01:26:12,193
You have insulted me
You have arraigned my legacy

742
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:15,523
l'm going to make sure you don't have
enough to pay for your funeral

743
01:26:15,697 --> 01:26:19,463
You are a rogue A cur
''You are an ingrate''

744
01:26:19,767 --> 01:26:22,201
Get out of here

745
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:25,134
You have not known what my anger is
l'll show you what l am

746
01:26:25,373 --> 01:26:28,206
l'll show you what Yodhraj is

747
01:26:31,108 --> 01:26:36,410
Arjun My son The war has begun
Yodhraj has gone mad

748
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:40,482
Says, he is going to starve me Says,
l won't get a penny even if l beg

749
01:26:40,718 --> 01:26:44,711
Not even enough to pay for my funeral
- Nothing of the sort will happen

750
01:26:45,055 --> 01:26:48,889
His success has gone to his head
He thinks he is God

751
01:26:49,193 --> 01:26:54,495
He thinks he rules the world
lf l want, l can ruin him right now

752
01:26:54,732 --> 01:26:59,726
But no l was born of decent parents.
l'll never harm one who has favoured me

753
01:26:59,937 --> 01:27:04,169
We must pay him back immediately
- How, Daddy?

754
01:27:04,341 --> 01:27:06,172
Right now

755
01:27:06,477 --> 01:27:09,446
And Rani, give me all your jewellery.
Spare Nina's

756
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:11,307
This is the day it was all made for.
Think of it that way

757
01:27:11,482 --> 01:27:13,746
Go to the factory.
Start double shifts

758
01:27:13,951 --> 01:27:16,385
Sell all you can
to put the money together

759
01:27:16,553 --> 01:27:18,748
Take loans from the banks.
l'm going to Hyderabad

760
01:27:18,956 --> 01:27:21,447
l'll sell the harvest of grapes
for all l can get

761
01:27:21,625 --> 01:27:23,593
And l'll throw the money
on Yodhraj's face

762
01:27:23,827 --> 01:27:25,920
Daddy, would that be enough?

763
01:27:26,096 --> 01:27:30,192
Son, we are he ones who have carved
our own destinies

764
01:27:30,501 --> 01:27:33,470
God stands by those
who are clean at heart

765
01:28:07,171 --> 01:28:09,639
Down with Mr Gujral

766
01:28:15,145 --> 01:28:16,976
Your reward

767
01:28:17,881 --> 01:28:22,841
Now you're in line
''Keep playing your cards''

768
01:28:23,554 --> 01:28:28,389
Some day, we will surely have
our revenges

769
01:28:30,894 --> 01:28:31,918
Who is it?

770
01:28:32,162 --> 01:28:33,390
Don't you see?
l'm busy

771
01:28:34,231 --> 01:28:35,664
What's the matter?

772
01:28:35,866 --> 01:28:38,130
Yes, people might come here.
But she isn't that type

773
01:28:38,369 --> 01:28:40,837
Who are you talking to?
- The water, the flowers

774
01:28:41,038 --> 01:28:44,804
What about...?
- They are discussing you

775
01:28:44,975 --> 01:28:47,842
Discussing me...? What?
- What? Do l tell her?

776
01:28:48,045 --> 01:28:49,842
Why, are you scared now?
Then why talk about it?

777
01:28:50,047 --> 01:28:51,344
Come on, tell me

778
01:28:52,216 --> 01:28:55,344
They say that folks come here
to take advantage of females

779
01:28:55,586 --> 01:28:59,352
They say, you've brought
one great piece Keep it up Enjoy

780
01:29:04,161 --> 01:29:12,261
''Life is all about love''

781
01:29:20,077 --> 01:29:24,309
''What of the earth,
what of the skies...?''

782
01:29:24,615 --> 01:29:27,982
''Tell me, l'll change the world''

783
01:29:54,912 --> 01:29:59,747
''New colours will light up our dreams''

784
01:30:01,118 --> 01:30:06,351
''The song will be the same
Sung on other lips''

785
01:30:19,236 --> 01:30:22,933
''Let's live like this
as long as we live''

786
01:30:23,407 --> 01:30:26,706
''Let's break all the rules''

787
01:30:27,544 --> 01:30:35,383
''Life is all about love''

788
01:31:10,028 --> 01:31:15,933
l have weathered many storms.
But this has blown me off my feet

789
01:31:16,134 --> 01:31:17,601
Rani, l need your help

790
01:31:18,570 --> 01:31:24,998
l'd give my life for you
'' But, l find no hope''

791
01:31:26,177 --> 01:31:31,114
How l wish, you'd understand what
a woman has in her heart. You're a man

792
01:31:31,716 --> 01:31:35,550
ls that my fault? How can l tell Arjun
that he is...

793
01:31:47,265 --> 01:31:50,564
What is it? You were discussing
something about me

794
01:31:52,937 --> 01:31:54,234
Why are you silent?

795
01:31:56,875 --> 01:31:58,638
Daddy, you look troubled

796
01:32:05,183 --> 01:32:09,847
Mummy, tell me. Have l done
something wrong?

797
01:32:11,556 --> 01:32:16,152
l am your son. l want to share
your joys and your sorrows

798
01:32:18,763 --> 01:32:22,995
Let me share your sorrows.
l'd be happy to... Daddy...?

799
01:32:35,246 --> 01:32:36,679
Who is this Rita?

800
01:32:40,051 --> 01:32:42,178
Rita is your mother

801
01:32:44,456 --> 01:32:46,185
Rita used to work in my office

802
01:32:47,525 --> 01:32:52,292
When she married, whom she married,
l do not know

803
01:32:53,064 --> 01:32:57,023
One day she said that she has a son.
But for some reason...

804
01:32:57,268 --> 01:32:59,031
she could not give him
his father's name

805
01:33:00,138 --> 01:33:07,237
She wanted me to adopt the baby.
l adopted you

806
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:10,648
Afterwards, she disappeared

807
01:33:11,816 --> 01:33:17,652
After all these years, here comes this
telegram, from a convent in Darjeeling

808
01:33:36,708 --> 01:33:37,675
Mother...?

809
01:34:49,314 --> 01:34:51,077
God rest her soul

810
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:58,150
She stayed alive, just to meet me

811
01:34:59,791 --> 01:35:03,488
Those few moments matter
more than a lifetime for me

812
01:35:07,932 --> 01:35:13,962
This is all your mother had.
Accept these as her blessings

813
01:35:58,850 --> 01:36:02,081
Which means that Lala Yodhraj
is your grandfather

814
01:36:06,357 --> 01:36:10,225
Forgive me son, l was about to set
a family at war

815
01:36:10,595 --> 01:36:13,564
But now l have decided.
l will fight it out alone

816
01:36:14,332 --> 01:36:17,824
Your fight is mine, Daddy.
l am your son

817
01:36:18,536 --> 01:36:22,097
No son. Blood is thicker
than water

818
01:36:22,373 --> 01:36:25,035
Why make war within the family?

819
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:26,838
What if it makes a man feeble?

820
01:36:27,445 --> 01:36:33,315
Home is where the heart is, Daddy

821
01:36:36,554 --> 01:36:39,853
Maybe for this day, my mother
had named me Arjun

822
01:36:40,959 --> 01:36:45,987
When l go into battle, l must forget
what is family, what isn't

823
01:36:47,231 --> 01:36:51,998
The only thing l should remember is
the truth, and righteousness

824
01:36:52,637 --> 01:36:54,264
This is Arjun's religion

825
01:36:54,973 --> 01:36:57,271
This is my duty

826
01:37:03,114 --> 01:37:04,274
Can't you drive?

827
01:37:04,649 --> 01:37:06,879
Someone is standing
in the middle of the road

828
01:37:17,996 --> 01:37:24,128
Have you gone mad?
'' -Yes. l have gone mad''

829
01:37:41,219 --> 01:37:42,584
Uncle, did you ask for me?

830
01:37:46,624 --> 01:37:48,922
Gujral is resorting to arm twisting

831
01:37:49,694 --> 01:37:52,254
He has let loose his dog after me

832
01:37:52,697 --> 01:37:57,999
He has bitten off more than he can
chew. Tell me, what is to be done?

833
01:37:59,437 --> 01:38:07,003
l want Gujral to be driven into
auctioning off all he possesses

834
01:38:08,312 --> 01:38:10,678
Friends, now that the house
has been auctioned off...

835
01:38:10,982 --> 01:38:13,348
it's the turn for the furnitures.
This dining table is worth 50,000

836
01:38:13,584 --> 01:38:14,516
The bidding begins

837
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:16,084
8,000
- 10,000

838
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:17,218
12,000
- 16,000

839
01:38:17,388 --> 01:38:22,348
Going for 16,000... one... two...

840
01:38:22,727 --> 01:38:25,218
Sold for 16,000

841
01:38:27,065 --> 01:38:28,032
Now this sofa set

842
01:38:28,566 --> 01:38:30,966
This is an expensive sofa set.
Please give your bids

843
01:38:33,137 --> 01:38:34,536
6,000
- 7,000

844
01:38:34,739 --> 01:38:36,297
1 4,000
- 18,000

845
01:38:36,941 --> 01:38:39,967
Going for 18,000... one... two...

846
01:38:40,411 --> 01:38:42,538
Sold for 16,000

847
01:38:46,884 --> 01:38:49,375
Everything has been auctioned off

848
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:52,248
But the amount under croke
has not yet been raised

849
01:38:52,423 --> 01:38:55,256
Now lndersen Gujral now goes
under the hammer

850
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:58,388
No l'm not going to let
this auction happen

851
01:39:01,232 --> 01:39:04,724
What happened to you?
Who's auctioning... what?

852
01:39:08,773 --> 01:39:09,740
lt's nothing

853
01:39:11,509 --> 01:39:12,567
What is the matter, Mummy?

854
01:39:12,910 --> 01:39:18,007
Your father cried out in his sleep.
Nowadays, he's so disturbed

855
01:39:18,449 --> 01:39:21,145
l don't know what's wrong with him

856
01:39:21,719 --> 01:39:23,744
l know

857
01:39:24,655 --> 01:39:26,520
You're worried about the debts,
isn't it?

858
01:39:28,259 --> 01:39:32,593
We were pitted against men. Now it's
like being pitted even against God

859
01:39:32,930 --> 01:39:37,026
This bad patch will blow over, Daddy.
- l know son. This kind of a thing...

860
01:39:37,335 --> 01:39:40,304
has happened several times in my life.
l have never been afraid

861
01:39:40,471 --> 01:39:41,631
Then what is it today?

862
01:39:43,274 --> 01:39:46,038
Then l was young.
l could put up a fight

863
01:39:46,210 --> 01:39:48,303
Today l am young.
l can fight

864
01:39:49,213 --> 01:39:51,773
You were alone.
Now there are the two of us

865
01:39:52,083 --> 01:39:55,610
Together, we can weather
the worst of storms

866
01:39:58,156 --> 01:39:59,646
As long as l am alive,
nothing will happen to you

867
01:39:59,824 --> 01:40:01,792
May you live a thousand years

868
01:40:02,493 --> 01:40:07,055
You are my right hand, son
l'm not going to run scared

869
01:40:39,864 --> 01:40:41,422
What is the matter, doctor?
ls everything all right?

870
01:40:41,599 --> 01:40:44,227
Lalaji is in poor health.
His blood pressure has increased again

871
01:40:44,802 --> 01:40:49,102
Looks like he is in some tensions.
He should rest for a few days

872
01:40:50,541 --> 01:40:53,442
l'm leaving. l'll be back for
a check-up tomorrow morning

873
01:41:01,886 --> 01:41:03,854
Vicky my child, come

874
01:41:13,164 --> 01:41:16,133
What is the matter, Grandpa?
How are you?

875
01:41:16,434 --> 01:41:22,395
lt's nothing. l was just a bit worried.
So l called the doctor over

876
01:41:24,842 --> 01:41:29,870
You seem disturbed of late.
What is it?

877
01:41:31,249 --> 01:41:33,149
Nothing important, son

878
01:41:35,186 --> 01:41:38,883
Maybe not important, but it surely
is something

879
01:41:40,691 --> 01:41:44,889
Tell me. lf not me, whom
are you going to tell?

880
01:41:47,465 --> 01:41:51,834
You are right, son.
lf not you, who?

881
01:41:55,940 --> 01:42:01,776
l'm tired of the antics
of this Gujral's son

882
01:42:04,548 --> 01:42:09,247
l am not of the age when
one ignores taunts

883
01:42:12,957 --> 01:42:16,188
Don't worry.
Everything will be all right

884
01:42:44,722 --> 01:42:46,781
l want to tell you my story

885
01:42:48,426 --> 01:42:51,554
lt's the story of my life.
lt doesn't involve you

886
01:42:52,463 --> 01:42:55,626
Nevertheless, listen
''l was very young then''

887
01:42:56,600 --> 01:43:01,230
Too young even to know that
my father had deserted me

888
01:43:02,139 --> 01:43:06,576
He never tried to tell me the reasons.
And l never felt the need...

889
01:43:06,811 --> 01:43:11,248
to ask of a father like him.
Do you know why?

890
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:19,986
Because my aged yet able grandfather
had already taken up my responsibility

891
01:43:20,825 --> 01:43:25,524
Never would he allow me to feel
the need for anything

892
01:43:26,630 --> 01:43:29,861
l am what l am today,
all because of him

893
01:43:32,036 --> 01:43:36,939
lf anyone tries to hassle him,
or makes him unhappy...

894
01:43:37,575 --> 01:43:40,840
l'm going to kill him.
Understand?

895
01:43:41,846 --> 01:43:43,871
This is what l came to tell you

896
01:43:50,187 --> 01:43:51,017
Wait

897
01:44:02,933 --> 01:44:05,424
l too want to tell you something

898
01:44:06,470 --> 01:44:12,033
The one who did all this for you,
the one you're threatening me about...

899
01:44:12,243 --> 01:44:19,046
is your grandfather, your own blood.
But the man who has done for me...

900
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:24,313
is no one to me,
nor am l related to him

901
01:44:26,757 --> 01:44:31,456
lf anything happens to him,
l won't spare you

902
01:44:34,198 --> 01:44:35,893
l'm going to kill you

903
01:44:38,302 --> 01:44:39,326
Really?

904
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:43,901
For the last time,
let's shake hands over this

905
01:46:13,797 --> 01:46:15,992
l will not ask you
where you are going

906
01:46:16,867 --> 01:46:21,167
The murderous vengeance in your eyes
tells me that...

907
01:46:21,472 --> 01:46:25,704
you are going to kill Lala Yodhraj

908
01:46:26,410 --> 01:46:27,843
And the outcome...

909
01:46:28,212 --> 01:46:30,442
the outcome is just
what Yodhraj wants

910
01:46:31,215 --> 01:46:33,445
A life sentence for you

911
01:46:33,751 --> 01:46:36,185
And for Mr Gujral's widow
and daughter, destitution

912
01:46:38,222 --> 01:46:41,851
Let them burn in this fire

913
01:46:42,493 --> 01:46:46,793
But to do that, you will have to put
your head over your heart

914
01:46:56,740 --> 01:46:57,934
Lalaji, this is Arjun

915
01:46:59,710 --> 01:47:02,042
l have good news for you

916
01:47:03,447 --> 01:47:07,474
Your old friend Mr Gujral
has just committed suicide

917
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:11,745
But this is the last piece
of good news

918
01:47:12,590 --> 01:47:15,218
From now on, every news
will be bad news

919
01:47:15,726 --> 01:47:18,217
l'll keep you updated

920
01:47:24,735 --> 01:47:27,499
By this fire l swear...

921
01:47:27,805 --> 01:47:30,239
your dream hotel will come true

922
01:47:31,809 --> 01:47:34,835
All your life, you have walked
with your head held high

923
01:47:35,279 --> 01:47:36,974
l will not let your head
hang in shame

924
01:47:37,715 --> 01:47:42,914
With every drop of my blood,
l shall repay every penny you owe

925
01:48:04,775 --> 01:48:07,266
''ln faith you shall find power''

926
01:48:07,578 --> 01:48:10,547
''ln confrontation you shall
earn your confidence''

927
01:48:16,420 --> 01:48:20,948
''ln your deeds''

928
01:48:22,326 --> 01:48:27,821
''You shall find victory''

929
01:48:28,599 --> 01:48:30,965
''Ever since this world was created''

930
01:48:31,268 --> 01:48:33,964
''Says the Gita''

931
01:48:39,943 --> 01:48:44,573
''ln your deeds''

932
01:48:45,616 --> 01:48:48,585
''You shall find victory''

933
01:48:48,886 --> 01:48:54,586
''Victory You shall find victory''

934
01:49:27,991 --> 01:49:30,892
Every wall in the city
will carry this poster

935
01:49:31,128 --> 01:49:33,961
l assure you, victory will be ours

936
01:49:35,332 --> 01:49:36,629
The first instalment

937
01:49:38,235 --> 01:49:43,195
Sons have avenged their fathers

938
01:49:43,841 --> 01:49:49,040
But no son has ever paid the price
for his father's murder

939
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:50,647
This is just what l am doing

940
01:49:50,948 --> 01:49:51,710
What nonsense?

941
01:49:52,015 --> 01:49:54,916
Not nonsense. lt's the truth.
My father was a proud man

942
01:49:55,085 --> 01:49:59,215
You cornered him over a false claim,
you strangled him

943
01:49:59,590 --> 01:50:03,219
He did not commit suicide. He was
killed. And you are his murderer

944
01:50:04,228 --> 01:50:06,389
Do you know who you are talking to?
One more word...

945
01:50:06,597 --> 01:50:10,328
and l'll rip your tongue out
- What else can you do?

946
01:50:10,534 --> 01:50:15,403
But after l've turned on the heat,
you will find it hard to breathe

947
01:50:34,858 --> 01:50:35,882
What's this?

948
01:50:40,664 --> 01:50:41,824
Who put up these posters?

949
01:50:43,734 --> 01:50:45,895
l don't know, sir.
- You don't know?

950
01:50:46,069 --> 01:50:48,367
Were you sleeping?
Rip those off

951
01:50:52,543 --> 01:50:54,101
ls my name written on it?

952
01:50:55,479 --> 01:50:58,039
Why raise your voice?
You're drawing attention

953
01:51:05,088 --> 01:51:06,578
Did you put up all the posters?
- Yes

954
01:51:06,824 --> 01:51:09,122
And what happened?
- They are very disturbed

955
01:51:10,427 --> 01:51:14,727
Disturbed they will be,
once the hotel is built

956
01:51:25,108 --> 01:51:27,474
Come, sit down.
How about breakfast?

957
01:51:27,644 --> 01:51:28,633
l've had breakfast

958
01:51:31,782 --> 01:51:34,808
What brings you so early?
- l'm here to meet Uncle

959
01:51:35,919 --> 01:51:37,318
What am l being glad about?

960
01:51:38,188 --> 01:51:41,157
Anything special?
- l'm organising a show

961
01:51:41,391 --> 01:51:47,159
l want you to be the chief guest.
- You should've tried a film star

962
01:51:47,798 --> 01:51:50,164
ls your value any less than
a film star's?

963
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:54,336
You're running for the elections.
You need all the exposure you can get

964
01:51:54,738 --> 01:51:56,899
That's true. When is this show?

965
01:53:48,652 --> 01:53:50,552
Was that a show or
an advertisement for murder?

966
01:53:50,988 --> 01:53:54,424
You called us in to show us that?
ls this the exposure you planned?

967
01:53:55,325 --> 01:54:00,558
l don't know who did this.
- Who was she?

968
01:54:00,864 --> 01:54:02,889
Quiz her
- l've tried to locate her

969
01:54:03,066 --> 01:54:06,160
But she vanished.
l don't know a thing, Vicky

970
01:54:08,005 --> 01:54:09,302
l know who's behind this

971
01:54:09,506 --> 01:54:13,806
l'm not going to let him live
- You will do nothing

972
01:54:15,512 --> 01:54:19,175
Don't you forget that we live
in glass houses

973
01:54:20,283 --> 01:54:24,982
For the media, we are news.
Our every act is monitored

974
01:54:25,689 --> 01:54:27,919
lf we do anything,
it can only go against us

975
01:54:28,091 --> 01:54:31,492
No Grandpa, no
- You will do nothing, Vicky

976
01:54:32,162 --> 01:54:34,062
For my sake

977
01:54:34,965 --> 01:54:37,331
Did the fashion show go well?
- Yes

978
01:54:39,770 --> 01:54:45,003
Now Yodhraj is running for office.
Let me brief you

979
01:54:48,311 --> 01:54:51,508
Politics has become a business

980
01:54:51,715 --> 01:54:55,674
The sacrifices of our forefathers
are mere stories

981
01:54:55,986 --> 01:54:59,217
Their photographs are used
merely to decorate

982
01:54:59,656 --> 01:55:03,683
ln a situation like this, asking
for votes and making promises...

983
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:06,954
is like spinning a yarn.
lt's ridiculous

984
01:55:07,397 --> 01:55:08,694
But l shall try to...

985
01:55:14,204 --> 01:55:19,039
Who killed Gujral?

986
01:55:45,702 --> 01:55:46,669
What do you want?

987
01:55:47,437 --> 01:55:49,667
Where's Arjun?
- Arjun isn't here

988
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:53,403
Tell him

989
01:56:11,061 --> 01:56:13,689
Who killed Gujral?

990
01:56:21,271 --> 01:56:23,637
What happened, Daddy?

991
01:56:25,008 --> 01:56:30,036
Everything is all right.
Go to sleep

992
01:56:42,926 --> 01:56:45,053
Yes Mr Sharma, where
are you speaking from?

993
01:56:45,362 --> 01:56:47,796
Ward 9...? What's the position
over there?

994
01:56:48,365 --> 01:56:49,332
17,000 votes?

995
01:56:49,666 --> 01:56:50,633
Grandpa, we are leading
by 17,000 votes

996
01:56:50,901 --> 01:56:53,802
What? We are in a strong position?

997
01:56:54,437 --> 01:56:58,806
Listen to me. Go for a recounting.
Something might go wrong over there

998
01:56:59,176 --> 01:57:01,644
Till the last update,
the trend is in our favour

999
01:57:01,978 --> 01:57:05,812
Counting has started in Ward 20.
But no reports have come out yet

1000
01:57:06,183 --> 01:57:11,280
The trend is favouring us.
Barring mishaps, you will win

1001
01:57:11,755 --> 01:57:14,087
Trailing? How can that be?

1002
01:57:14,324 --> 01:57:23,494
Lalaji, Arjun speaking

1003
01:57:24,467 --> 01:57:28,096
l warned you that
l'd have bad news for you

1004
01:57:29,005 --> 01:57:30,370
You have lost

1005
01:57:32,142 --> 01:57:34,702
Badly. You have lost your deposit

1006
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:39,110
Now wait for the next piece
of bad news

1007
01:57:39,616 --> 01:57:40,844
You will have it soon

1008
01:57:42,419 --> 01:57:46,116
This is a special bulletin
about the by-elections

1009
01:57:46,489 --> 01:57:50,858
The counting of votes in all wards
in the South constituency...

1010
01:57:51,161 --> 01:57:55,530
has been completed.
The result have been declared

1011
01:57:55,899 --> 01:57:59,391
Noted industrialist Yodhraj Bhalla
who was contesting...

1012
01:57:59,703 --> 01:58:06,404
as an independent candidate, has lost
by a margin of 57,703 votes

1013
01:58:07,444 --> 01:58:08,934
He has lost

1014
01:58:25,862 --> 01:58:32,426
''They're thieves...
they're amazing''

1015
01:58:39,075 --> 01:58:46,447
''They're into thievery;
it's difficult to escape them''

1016
01:58:46,950 --> 01:58:53,185
''Watch your pennies...
they're simply amazing''

1017
02:00:25,849 --> 02:00:33,551
''Your gait causes many hearts
to skip a beat''

1018
02:00:36,059 --> 02:00:40,291
''The Chaudhary rubs
his hands in desire...''

1019
02:00:44,334 --> 02:00:52,036
''Watch your money...
they're thieves''

1020
02:02:15,758 --> 02:02:17,123
Don't spare anyone

1021
02:02:24,434 --> 02:02:27,961
Bash them up
Each and every one of them

1022
02:03:40,743 --> 02:03:45,407
Bash them up They want
to take our livelihood away

1023
02:03:46,082 --> 02:03:51,145
You ought to dress up like women
You can't do something so simple?

1024
02:03:52,789 --> 02:03:55,485
Come with me. l'll avenge
my grandfather's defeat

1025
02:03:56,259 --> 02:03:57,226
Bring the car around

1026
02:04:21,551 --> 02:04:24,918
l told you Arjun, my grandfather
is very dear to me

1027
02:04:25,221 --> 02:04:27,519
And l told you too, that someday,
l'd get even

1028
02:04:29,692 --> 02:04:31,250
Get out of here

1029
02:04:47,577 --> 02:04:50,205
ls everything all right?
- Nothing is all right

1030
02:04:51,914 --> 02:04:55,281
Arjun has been beaten up badly.
l'm calling you from the hospital

1031
02:04:57,120 --> 02:04:58,951
ls Vicky at home?

1032
02:05:01,791 --> 02:05:03,281
How is Vicky involved?

1033
02:05:03,660 --> 02:05:07,562
Would l wake you up so late at night,
had Vicky not been involved?

1034
02:05:09,232 --> 02:05:10,290
Vicky isn't at home

1035
02:05:23,212 --> 02:05:25,646
Arjun, this police officer has come
to record your statement

1036
02:05:45,034 --> 02:05:49,164
How did this happen? Who were they?
Why did they attack you?

1037
02:05:49,706 --> 02:05:50,673
lt's nothing like that

1038
02:05:50,873 --> 02:05:56,334
This is not the time to cover up
for crimes. Tell the truth

1039
02:05:56,713 --> 02:05:58,613
Who were the ones
who were trying to kill you?

1040
02:05:59,382 --> 02:06:01,680
l didn't recognise anyone.
lt was dark

1041
02:06:02,051 --> 02:06:05,020
lt's dark in here
You've been brainwashed

1042
02:06:05,922 --> 02:06:12,225
l know who is forcing you to keep mum.
You aren't doing the right thing

1043
02:06:13,863 --> 02:06:16,354
D'you remember the registration number
of the car they used?

1044
02:06:16,899 --> 02:06:19,231
l didn't notice anything.
- Never mind

1045
02:06:19,535 --> 02:06:22,231
ln time, you might remember.
Excuse me, Mr Bhardwaj

1046
02:06:25,875 --> 02:06:29,367
Not the right thing to do, Arjun.
l called in the police...

1047
02:06:29,545 --> 02:06:34,039
and you say you have seen no one
... the ones who tried to kill you

1048
02:06:34,684 --> 02:06:37,050
You know fully well.
But you want to save him...

1049
02:06:37,286 --> 02:06:39,049
because he happens to be my son.
And l happen to be ashamed...

1050
02:06:39,255 --> 02:06:40,517
to call him my son

1051
02:06:41,290 --> 02:06:45,852
He would've been put paid.
But Ajit came by

1052
02:06:46,262 --> 02:06:49,390
He, that root cause.
l don't know what to do

1053
02:06:50,333 --> 02:06:54,736
Why do you bother me with such trivia?
Some decisions, even you can take

1054
02:06:59,876 --> 02:07:04,336
Suman, 25 years go, l swore
not to enter this house

1055
02:07:04,447 --> 02:07:06,677
Today, for Vicky's sake,
l have broken my promise

1056
02:07:07,183 --> 02:07:12,678
l didn't want Vicky to become someone
like Yodhraj. Which he has become

1057
02:07:13,389 --> 02:07:16,552
Like Yodhraj, he's trying
to buy the law

1058
02:07:17,226 --> 02:07:22,687
Like Yodhraj, he thinks of life as
a game of chess, people are his pawns

1059
02:07:23,533 --> 02:07:25,228
Remember one thing, Suman

1060
02:07:26,002 --> 02:07:30,098
ln these murderous games,
not only the loser loses

1061
02:07:30,306 --> 02:07:33,366
Even the winner loses.
- Stop lecturing

1062
02:07:34,210 --> 02:07:37,976
No one here needs lectures.
- A lecture you need

1063
02:07:38,481 --> 02:07:41,041
lt's my duty to stop you
from self-destruction

1064
02:07:41,217 --> 02:07:44,516
Because... you are my son,
an l am your father

1065
02:07:45,154 --> 02:07:50,285
Get this clear, Mr Ajit Bhardwaj.
l am not your son

1066
02:07:50,493 --> 02:07:52,290
And you are not my father

1067
02:07:53,095 --> 02:07:55,928
You should've slapped him
like that a long time ago

1068
02:07:56,766 --> 02:07:58,734
You are too late

1069
02:07:59,168 --> 02:08:02,467
This situation need never have arisen.
Today, it's Arjun who's in the hospital

1070
02:08:02,705 --> 02:08:04,730
Tomorrow, something
might happen to Vicky

1071
02:08:05,708 --> 02:08:10,008
Remember this. Come what may,
Vicky is our son, born of our love

1072
02:08:10,379 --> 02:08:13,473
lf anything happens to him,
l will never forgive you

1073
02:08:13,783 --> 02:08:16,013
Never will l forgive you

1074
02:08:37,406 --> 02:08:38,498
Bastard

1075
02:09:04,233 --> 02:09:07,464
The spawn of a snake
can only be a snake

1076
02:09:07,837 --> 02:09:12,467
Now l know what you are
Just wait and see

1077
02:09:14,844 --> 02:09:18,803
What's wrong with you? Are you mad?
You could get hurt

1078
02:09:19,582 --> 02:09:25,384
That bastard Suresh... shot at him
... he might have been hurt

1079
02:09:25,588 --> 02:09:27,818
And then l lost my mind
... something happened

1080
02:09:28,057 --> 02:09:30,389
l pounced on him... but why...?

1081
02:09:32,929 --> 02:09:34,624
l don't know...

1082
02:09:36,999 --> 02:09:40,901
Why... how did this happen?

1083
02:09:41,938 --> 02:09:43,166
And l did it for that man...?

1084
02:09:44,006 --> 02:09:50,844
Son, when someone related to you
is attacked, you react naturally

1085
02:10:20,643 --> 02:10:24,135
Had l known that my wounds
would bring you back to me...

1086
02:10:25,514 --> 02:10:28,881
l would've cut myself open
long, long ago

1087
02:11:10,226 --> 02:11:13,491
So these photographs are a substitute
for your son?

1088
02:11:15,698 --> 02:11:20,499
Not mere photographs.
For me, this is life

1089
02:11:24,140 --> 02:11:29,669
l ask you, as you needed your son,
did your son not need his father?

1090
02:11:31,714 --> 02:11:33,944
Not love, this is being self-centered

1091
02:11:37,987 --> 02:11:41,150
Not being self-centered.
lt's self-respect

1092
02:11:41,724 --> 02:11:45,216
Respect of the self meant more to you
than your son's happiness?

1093
02:11:46,062 --> 02:11:49,691
Some live for wealth

1094
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:52,695
Some live for fame

1095
02:11:53,002 --> 02:11:54,970
Some live for love

1096
02:11:56,005 --> 02:12:00,704
But l had nothing to live by
but my self-respect

1097
02:12:02,344 --> 02:12:05,245
Did you not look beyond
that wall of self-respect?

1098
02:12:05,614 --> 02:12:08,378
Over on the other side,
there was a whole new world

1099
02:12:08,918 --> 02:12:11,318
The world your only son
was born into

1100
02:12:11,754 --> 02:12:14,723
And he needed a finger to hold on to,
while he learnt how to walk

1101
02:12:15,758 --> 02:12:21,321
Did you not even feel the need to know
how he was growing up, step by step?

1102
02:12:23,432 --> 02:12:27,994
He needed something more than
food and clothing

1103
02:12:28,304 --> 02:12:31,068
That something was a father's love.
- Before the father's love...

1104
02:12:31,307 --> 02:12:35,266
there stood another barrier.
Maybe you have not noticed it

1105
02:12:35,778 --> 02:12:39,737
lt was a wall of hatred.
Lala Yodhraj's hatred

1106
02:12:40,182 --> 02:12:42,412
Was that hatred stronger
than our love?

1107
02:12:42,651 --> 02:12:45,518
Do not think that l did not challenge
that wall of hatred

1108
02:12:47,923 --> 02:12:52,758
But wall would not give in.
lt was l who crumbled

1109
02:12:53,629 --> 02:12:56,097
And having said that, you absolve
yourself of all responsibility?

1110
02:12:57,900 --> 02:13:01,427
You crumbled; l was denied
a father's love

1111
02:13:01,804 --> 02:13:06,434
l have only half an identity
''Who will make good my loss?''

1112
02:13:06,909 --> 02:13:10,709
Time
''Vijay, time heals all wounds''

1113
02:13:11,747 --> 02:13:13,647
Whether what happened was good
or whether it was bad...

1114
02:13:13,816 --> 02:13:15,374
leave that decision to time

1115
02:13:15,818 --> 02:13:17,046
What nonsense

1116
02:13:17,620 --> 02:13:20,646
Yodhraj enterprises hasn't enough
in the bank to pay the staff?

1117
02:13:20,956 --> 02:13:23,049
Are you out of your mind?
Do you realise what you are saying?

1118
02:13:23,292 --> 02:13:26,386
Sir, the cashier has just returned
empty-handed from the bank

1119
02:13:26,829 --> 02:13:29,798
The month's salary cheques to the tune
of 900,000 could not be encashed

1120
02:13:33,102 --> 02:13:36,333
They are our suppliers.
Their cheques have bounced too

1121
02:13:36,505 --> 02:13:39,804
The bank has refused to renew
our letters of credit

1122
02:13:39,975 --> 02:13:42,068
The earnest monies to be deposited
for government contracts have bounced

1123
02:13:42,311 --> 02:13:45,075
The bank has failed to encash
the cheque for 600,000...

1124
02:13:45,247 --> 02:13:48,011
relating to the real estate business.
- What is all this going on?

1125
02:13:48,184 --> 02:13:50,152
Call the bank immediately

1126
02:13:56,258 --> 02:13:58,556
Yodhraj speaking

1127
02:13:59,461 --> 02:14:02,362
Why are my cheques bouncing?
What's the balance on my account?

1128
02:14:05,201 --> 02:14:07,362
1 ,200

1129
02:14:07,603 --> 02:14:09,628
Only a few days ago, the balance
exceeded 5.6 million

1130
02:14:10,139 --> 02:14:13,836
You drew 5.6 million in cash yesterday.

1131
02:14:14,210 --> 02:14:17,179
Wrong l signed no cheque
for 5.6 million

1132
02:14:17,413 --> 02:14:19,176
l'll send them all to jail

1133
02:14:19,348 --> 02:14:21,111
Check it again Was that my signature?

1134
02:14:23,886 --> 02:14:28,448
We're being subjected to a big fraud
But arrange to pay off everyone

1135
02:14:28,624 --> 02:14:29,989
But...
- No buts

1136
02:14:30,226 --> 02:14:31,853
Mortgage a hotel,
or sell a factory

1137
02:14:32,027 --> 02:14:33,995
But by this evening,
the payments have to be made

1138
02:14:37,233 --> 02:14:38,461
The cheque bears your signature

1139
02:14:43,906 --> 02:14:46,136
This is a leaf from one
of your old chequebooks

1140
02:14:46,442 --> 02:14:48,876
But the signature is yours.
And it's dated yesterday

1141
02:14:51,513 --> 02:14:52,605
Old chequebook...

1142
02:14:53,916 --> 02:14:57,750
Once signed, it's no less
than legal tender

1143
02:14:58,587 --> 02:15:03,422
Maybe you cannot even imagine what
it's worth, if it's a blank cheque

1144
02:15:15,204 --> 02:15:20,164
The signature is mine.
And l have issued this cheque

1145
02:15:28,951 --> 02:15:34,184
At last, after 25 years,
you have taken your price

1146
02:15:34,890 --> 02:15:37,450
Not 5.6 million, not all the wealth
in this world...

1147
02:15:37,626 --> 02:15:39,594
can compensate for the way
you were insulted

1148
02:15:41,363 --> 02:15:43,923
l just want to see him suffer

1149
02:15:45,968 --> 02:15:50,530
Bless me mother, that l may be able
to repay your debt

1150
02:15:59,915 --> 02:16:01,940
Arjun speaking, Mr Yodhraj

1151
02:16:03,185 --> 02:16:05,949
The markets are hot
with news about you

1152
02:16:06,522 --> 02:16:11,221
l hear you don't even have money
to pay your staff...?

1153
02:16:13,195 --> 02:16:14,560
Not to get worked up, Lalaji

1154
02:16:15,597 --> 02:16:19,226
Losing money is perhaps
the biggest blow to you

1155
02:16:19,835 --> 02:16:22,633
Life and death is trivial
by your standards

1156
02:16:23,472 --> 02:16:28,967
But for me, keeping the enemy alive,
not letting him die, is more fun

1157
02:16:29,345 --> 02:16:32,246
Tell me, how much money would you
need? l could have it sent over

1158
02:16:32,681 --> 02:16:34,979
Say 2 million, 3 million, 5 million?

1159
02:16:37,686 --> 02:16:39,916
Alcohol is no solution
to any problem

1160
02:16:40,222 --> 02:16:42,656
Were it not for this mistake
l committed 25 years ago...

1161
02:16:43,025 --> 02:16:47,257
you would be known today
as Vikram Bhardwaj, not Vicky

1162
02:16:47,629 --> 02:16:53,590
But who gives me my identity?
- You. Only you, my son

1163
02:16:54,370 --> 02:16:56,998
l am the one who is responsible
for the state you are in

1164
02:16:57,206 --> 02:17:01,870
l got carried away by emotions.
- Everyone gets carried away

1165
02:17:02,177 --> 02:17:06,546
But you sold out to the man for whom
people are no more than pawns

1166
02:17:06,715 --> 02:17:11,015
You, me, Rita, Shashi, Vicky
... we were all pawns

1167
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:15,014
My brother's death
obfuscated my reasoning

1168
02:17:15,657 --> 02:17:20,287
l saw my father lonely and helpless.
A daughter's heart was stirred

1169
02:17:20,896 --> 02:17:23,694
l could not become a good wife,
a good mother

1170
02:17:24,066 --> 02:17:28,025
But today Vicky, you must
make a good son

1171
02:17:29,071 --> 02:17:33,030
Whom shall l ask for those lost
days and nights?

1172
02:17:33,409 --> 02:17:35,707
Man he is, who rises from the ashes

1173
02:17:36,612 --> 02:17:40,639
ln life, every man
will have to fight his war

1174
02:17:40,883 --> 02:17:45,320
And every mother wishes that her son
will stand up like Arjun

1175
02:18:05,774 --> 02:18:09,335
Why are you sitting here in the dark?

1176
02:18:13,715 --> 02:18:16,548
For 25 years, l have lived
in this darkness

1177
02:18:19,521 --> 02:18:22,081
l held on to your finger
when l learnt how to walk

1178
02:18:24,193 --> 02:18:26,923
And till today, it is your finger
that guides me

1179
02:18:28,330 --> 02:18:30,355
l do not accuse you

1180
02:18:32,134 --> 02:18:36,230
l was the one who was blinded by love,
and consigned to this darkness

1181
02:18:39,007 --> 02:18:40,497
l think you have had
too much to drink

1182
02:18:40,742 --> 02:18:45,076
Yes l...
'' am drunk''

1183
02:18:47,049 --> 02:18:50,644
So drunk, that l am not afraid
to speak the truth...

1184
02:18:50,819 --> 02:18:52,650
nor afraid to hear the truth...

1185
02:18:53,021 --> 02:18:54,989
nor afraid to know the truth...

1186
02:18:57,292 --> 02:19:01,388
And the truth is Grandpa,
you are hiding behind lies

1187
02:19:03,098 --> 02:19:05,532
And l... l am with you

1188
02:19:10,906 --> 02:19:14,137
l'm just one of your lieutenants

1189
02:19:14,510 --> 02:19:20,415
And the war l'm fighting,
is meaningless, purposeless

1190
02:19:22,184 --> 02:19:25,676
All l can do, is keep fighting,
or just lose out

1191
02:19:26,655 --> 02:19:28,748
Because in the end,
it's truth that triumphs

1192
02:19:29,458 --> 02:19:32,154
Enough of rhetoric, Vicky.
Now stop drinking

1193
02:19:34,196 --> 02:19:37,427
lf l stop drinking,
l'll come to my senses

1194
02:19:38,400 --> 02:19:41,995
And the lies will start
looking like the truth

1195
02:19:43,205 --> 02:19:44,695
l'm only your shadow

1196
02:19:45,407 --> 02:19:50,174
Your loves are my loves
Your hatred is mine

1197
02:19:50,879 --> 02:19:54,838
And by and by, l have lost myself,
my identity

1198
02:19:55,050 --> 02:19:58,178
l have even lost my father

1199
02:20:00,489 --> 02:20:04,516
To meet your selfish ends,
you have denied me my father's love

1200
02:20:04,760 --> 02:20:06,455
You've made an orphan out of me

1201
02:20:07,563 --> 02:20:12,398
ln you, as in me, only one man lived.
Lala Yodhraj Bhalla

1202
02:20:13,569 --> 02:20:17,198
Now there's no place for
Lala Yodhraj Bhalla in this house

1203
02:20:17,439 --> 02:20:21,466
Because, this house is mine
l want to live in this house

1204
02:20:22,244 --> 02:20:23,677
l have arrived

1205
02:20:25,647 --> 02:20:29,743
From now on, l am the son of
Ajit Bhardwaj...

1206
02:20:29,918 --> 02:20:31,476
Vikram Bhardwaj

1207
02:21:26,575 --> 02:21:30,875
Alone
''l am all alone, Shashi''

1208
02:21:34,650 --> 02:21:36,550
You left in such a huff, son

1209
02:21:37,586 --> 02:21:40,817
Not even in my dreams
did you come back to me

1210
02:21:44,593 --> 02:21:46,117
Suman is gone

1211
02:21:48,230 --> 02:21:54,567
And now the one in whom l saw
my future, has gone away too

1212
02:21:56,605 --> 02:21:57,572
Yes son

1213
02:21:59,174 --> 02:22:00,141
Now...
''Vicky has left too''

1214
02:22:07,015 --> 02:22:09,984
l am broken... tired

1215
02:22:21,697 --> 02:22:23,255
Lalaji, Arjun speaking

1216
02:22:24,366 --> 02:22:25,856
l just received some bad news

1217
02:22:26,034 --> 02:22:29,993
Your daughter and your grandson
have deserted you

1218
02:22:32,140 --> 02:22:36,600
So l decided, why not talk to you
for a while... to console you

1219
02:22:37,379 --> 02:22:40,610
The house must be as lonely
as a graveyard

1220
02:22:41,883 --> 02:22:45,011
You should expect another
piece of bad news, Lalaji

1221
02:22:45,387 --> 02:22:47,548
l will come myself
to give you the news

1222
02:23:08,243 --> 02:23:12,373
l remember telling you that a tiger
comes to his element when he's wounded

1223
02:23:15,016 --> 02:23:16,916
Arjun has wounded me

1224
02:23:20,756 --> 02:23:24,055
Only his death can salve my wounds

1225
02:23:25,694 --> 02:23:29,221
For which l'm willing to pay any price

1226
02:23:29,965 --> 02:23:32,399
You needn't pay any price, Uncle.
Your work will be done

1227
02:23:34,703 --> 02:23:37,228
Arjun's hotel is being
inaugurated today

1228
02:23:37,773 --> 02:23:40,401
l will give you the good news
today itself

1229
02:24:05,801 --> 02:24:08,429
l was coming to meet you, Arjun
'' -Me...?''

1230
02:24:09,337 --> 02:24:14,172
l want to tell you that if we couldn't
stay friends for long...

1231
02:24:14,409 --> 02:24:17,435
would it not be better if we didn't
stay enemies for long...?

1232
02:24:19,381 --> 02:24:21,440
What do you say?

1233
02:24:26,254 --> 02:24:28,119
You have taken a weight off my chest

1234
02:24:51,847 --> 02:24:55,214
Shashi...?
''My son''

1235
02:25:00,355 --> 02:25:02,084
Am l dreaming?

1236
02:25:03,992 --> 02:25:06,017
A dream shattered

1237
02:25:07,662 --> 02:25:09,755
You've shattered a thousand dreams too

1238
02:25:10,131 --> 02:25:16,366
You...? How dare you come here?
And what have you come to take?

1239
02:25:17,539 --> 02:25:21,498
Beyond the give and the take,
you still cannot think, Mr Yodhraj

1240
02:25:22,377 --> 02:25:24,777
But today, l come not to take.
l have come to give

1241
02:25:25,747 --> 02:25:28,113
l have come to return what
a woman entrusted unto me

1242
02:25:28,550 --> 02:25:29,346
Woman... who?

1243
02:25:29,684 --> 02:25:31,982
The woman you tried to buy out

1244
02:25:32,687 --> 02:25:35,781
The one whose love you took
for a commodity

1245
02:25:36,224 --> 02:25:40,126
The price for which, was no more
than a blank cheque

1246
02:25:41,029 --> 02:25:44,328
Writing cheques out of millions
stashed in the bank, that you know

1247
02:25:44,499 --> 02:25:46,933
But you have not learnt how to
appreciate human beings

1248
02:25:49,704 --> 02:25:51,535
This coat... do you recognise it?

1249
02:25:53,241 --> 02:25:54,799
Maybe this pen?

1250
02:25:56,244 --> 02:25:58,542
A copy of that blank cheque
might remind you of something?

1251
02:25:58,847 --> 02:26:01,077
Blank cheque?
Which blank cheque?

1252
02:26:01,583 --> 02:26:07,544
The cheque that lay under the pillow
of that unfortunate woman for 25 years

1253
02:26:07,856 --> 02:26:11,553
But when presented to your account,
it shook you to the very foundations

1254
02:26:12,427 --> 02:26:14,361
All these things...

1255
02:26:14,529 --> 02:26:16,759
how did you get these?
Who are you?

1256
02:26:17,265 --> 02:26:19,563
This is what l have come to ask you.
Who am l?

1257
02:26:20,435 --> 02:26:24,895
l do not know. But give that coat
and that pen to me

1258
02:26:25,874 --> 02:26:27,569
They carry memories of my son

1259
02:26:28,076 --> 02:26:31,842
Not so easily. They will have
to be a transaction

1260
02:26:33,281 --> 02:26:38,241
Keep this. A cheque for 5.6 million.
The money l drew from your account

1261
02:26:39,621 --> 02:26:44,115
ln return, you will have to
give me back my mother and my father

1262
02:26:44,893 --> 02:26:46,918
But l do not know
who your parents are

1263
02:26:47,429 --> 02:26:49,420
You know You know everything

1264
02:26:50,031 --> 02:26:54,434
This pen and this coat you had given
to my father Shashiraj Bhalla

1265
02:26:55,470 --> 02:26:58,200
And the cheque you gave
to my mother Rita

1266
02:26:58,773 --> 02:27:03,437
And l am the son of
your unfortunate son, Mr Yodhraj

1267
02:27:13,488 --> 02:27:18,892
You are Shashi's son?
My Shashi's son?

1268
02:27:21,930 --> 02:27:23,898
lt's my blood that
runs in your veins

1269
02:27:27,135 --> 02:27:33,301
Arjun, l am Shashi's father
You are my grandson

1270
02:27:35,343 --> 02:27:36,901
You are my future, son

1271
02:27:37,212 --> 02:27:40,648
Stay away
''Stay away from me''

1272
02:27:41,883 --> 02:27:46,183
ln grief, sorrow and misery
you and l are related to each other

1273
02:27:46,888 --> 02:27:48,651
There is no other relationship

1274
02:27:49,224 --> 02:27:51,488
l refuse to accept you
as my grandfather

1275
02:27:51,693 --> 02:27:53,923
To me you are no one

1276
02:28:04,706 --> 02:28:11,009
What hurts a man most is the victory
of his enemy. Not his own loss

1277
02:28:12,814 --> 02:28:14,281
My hotel is being inaugurated.

1278
02:28:16,184 --> 02:28:19,278
This is the invitation.
Make sure you come

1279
02:28:20,321 --> 02:28:23,347
l will be glad to see you unhappy

1280
02:29:01,029 --> 02:29:07,264
Ujagar, the time has come
to settle all the scores

1281
02:29:07,602 --> 02:29:11,732
Don't worry. Everything is in place

1282
02:29:12,107 --> 02:29:13,335
What is the plan?

1283
02:29:18,313 --> 02:29:22,409
See this bomb?
The blue wire activates it

1284
02:29:22,617 --> 02:29:25,950
When one goes off,
a series of blasts will follow

1285
02:29:26,121 --> 02:29:29,579
Any chances of a mishap?
''-Only one chance''

1286
02:29:30,458 --> 02:29:31,083
What?

1287
02:29:31,793 --> 02:29:34,762
lf this blue wire is severed,
or somehow disconnected...

1288
02:29:35,063 --> 02:29:38,590
not one bomb will go off

1289
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:43,432
What if someone cuts it off?
- Then l shall kill him

1290
02:29:46,474 --> 02:29:51,036
What time do you want it set for?
- The inauguration is at midnight

1291
02:29:51,212 --> 02:29:55,706
lt's supposed to be auspicious.
- Then it'll be very auspicious for us

1292
02:29:56,084 --> 02:30:00,783
lf the inauguration and the closure
happens simultaneously...

1293
02:30:01,089 --> 02:30:05,253
it's going to be fun
- That's what will happen. Don't worry

1294
02:30:09,831 --> 02:30:11,321
Show me a sample

1295
02:30:32,387 --> 02:30:43,355
''ln your deeds
will you find your victory''

1296
02:31:09,657 --> 02:31:13,115
''Every moment is a moment of test''

1297
02:31:13,761 --> 02:31:17,128
''This is the law of life''

1298
02:32:09,484 --> 02:32:13,580
''Strange is the journey''

1299
02:32:13,955 --> 02:32:18,187
''At every breath, the unknown''

1300
02:32:18,493 --> 02:32:25,331
''Every man seeks himself''

1301
02:32:43,718 --> 02:32:47,484
''False are all the relationships''

1302
02:32:47,822 --> 02:32:51,781
''False is our relationship''

1303
02:32:52,126 --> 02:32:55,220
''lt is all a game of the time''

1304
02:33:00,668 --> 02:33:11,237
''ln your deeds...''
''will you find your victory''

1305
02:34:07,535 --> 02:34:15,306
''The terrain is rocky''
''Every goal is distant''

1306
02:34:15,910 --> 02:34:22,873
''Yet we have to live
our lives here''

1307
02:34:41,502 --> 02:34:45,063
''What fate has destined''

1308
02:34:45,440 --> 02:34:49,342
''No one has known''

1309
02:34:49,777 --> 02:34:53,008
''Who knows what the future holds?''

1310
02:34:58,653 --> 02:35:09,757
''ln your deeds...''
''will you find your victory''

1311
02:35:55,643 --> 02:35:57,474
Someone has wired the hotel with bombs

1312
02:35:59,780 --> 02:36:02,146
The hotel is wired with bombs
Get out Fast

1313
02:36:24,205 --> 02:36:25,433
What's going on over here?

1314
02:36:25,873 --> 02:36:27,170
Someone has wired the hotel with bombs

1315
02:36:27,542 --> 02:36:30,841
No This can't be
''Where's Arjun?''

1316
02:36:37,451 --> 02:36:40,852
l can't go anywhere lt has taken me
25 years to get here

1317
02:36:41,055 --> 02:36:43,649
What are you saying?
- l want to rejoice with Arjun

1318
02:36:43,824 --> 02:36:46,019
l cannot leave this place.
He is my flesh and blood

1319
02:36:46,227 --> 02:36:49,458
He is Shashi's son
He's your cousin, Vicky

1320
02:36:52,233 --> 02:36:53,860
There's no one over there

1321
02:36:54,068 --> 02:37:00,473
Arjun, my son...

1322
02:37:02,176 --> 02:37:03,871
Arjun, l just came to know
... you are my cousin

1323
02:37:05,446 --> 02:37:07,880
Come Embrace me

1324
02:37:11,719 --> 02:37:14,552
Please get out of here
''Don't risk your lives''

1325
02:37:14,922 --> 02:37:17,049
You must come with us too
For you, l'll give up...

1326
02:37:17,258 --> 02:37:19,749
a thousand hotels like this.
- l cannot go anywhere

1327
02:37:20,528 --> 02:37:22,223
l have to repay my mother's debt

1328
02:37:22,530 --> 02:37:24,498
l have to make Mr Gujral's dream
come true

1329
02:37:24,799 --> 02:37:26,562
l have to pay back
the debt of my life

1330
02:37:26,934 --> 02:37:28,492
For me, this is the moment
of reckoning

1331
02:37:28,803 --> 02:37:31,033
Live and die l will,
with this hotel

1332
02:37:31,472 --> 02:37:34,771
lf that is the case Arjun,
you aren't alone

1333
02:37:35,076 --> 02:37:36,509
We are with you

1334
02:37:37,545 --> 02:37:38,910
But where are those bastards?

1335
02:37:40,114 --> 02:37:42,241
Won't make a difference
even if they come to know

1336
02:37:42,550 --> 02:37:44,780
Death stalks them at every turn

1337
02:37:45,553 --> 02:37:50,513
lt's 1 1 :30 now. At the strike of 12
this will turn into rubble

1338
02:37:51,125 --> 02:37:54,788
Come, let's watch the fireworks
from Juhu Beach

1339
02:38:12,913 --> 02:38:15,541
Just a few minutes to go
before the bombs go off

1340
02:38:25,526 --> 02:38:27,619
Where are the bombs? Tell me

Tell me Where are the bombs?
''Where are the bombs? Tell me''

1342
02:39:07,835 --> 02:39:10,133
That day, you managed
to save your son

1343
02:39:10,304 --> 02:39:12,272
Let's see who saves you today

1344
02:39:38,265 --> 02:39:40,358
Tell me you bastard

1345
02:40:27,114 --> 02:40:28,342
Are you all right, Grandpa?

1346

Don't bother about me.
Find the bombs

1347
02:40:34,388 --> 02:40:37,084
Where are the bombs?

1348

Tell me Where are the bombs?
''- ln the ballroom''

1349
02:41:34,048 --> 02:41:37,745
Tell me Else, l'll kill you

1350
02:41:43,123 --> 02:41:45,421
Vicky Stop

1351

The bomb can explode any moment
Don't touch it

1352
02:41:50,798 --> 02:41:53,494
This hotel l've built with my blood

1353
02:41:54,335 --> 02:41:57,327
Tell me, which wire is it?

1354
02:41:57,538 --> 02:42:03,033
Suresh Don't you tell him
We'll die, and we'll take them along

1355
02:42:08,549 --> 02:42:10,779
Tell me Else, l'll kill you

1356
02:42:11,218 --> 02:42:15,518
A dying man never lies.
'' The blue wire''

1357
02:42:20,227 --> 02:42:24,789
No Arjun What if Suresh is lying?

1358
02:43:09,610 --> 02:43:11,908
Stop
''Cut the yellow wire''

1359
02:43:39,740 --> 02:43:41,264
Today l have learnt

1360
02:43:41,475 --> 02:43:47,436
Man is now known by his name.
Man is known by his deeds

1361
02:43:48,515 --> 02:43:51,143
Forgive me, my sons
''Forgive me''

1362
02:43:57,858 --> 02:43:59,291
Forgive me, Grandpa

1363
02:44:05,132 --> 02:44:08,465
Please forget whatever has happened
