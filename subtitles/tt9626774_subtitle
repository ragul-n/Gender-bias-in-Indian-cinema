1
00:02:59,641 --> 00:03:02,933
Excuse me, bring one
full bottle of Glenfiddich

2
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,099
No need dude

3
00:03:05,724 --> 00:03:07,558
It’s price is high even in MRP

4
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:10,558
Bill will go high if we buy
in this five star hotel

5
00:03:11,308 --> 00:03:13,641
He is the one
who is throwing the party

6
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:15,849
Will he pay from his
hard earned money?

7
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:20,599
It is earned by cheating, betraying
and exploiting the innocents

8
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:21,516
Let him pay

9
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:25,599
For his stature, he has four cars
in the back and four in the front

10
00:03:31,641 --> 00:03:34,391
He lives in a lavish bungalow
and body guards for security

11
00:03:35,183 --> 00:03:37,433
How can his family live on
that unrighteous wealth?

12
00:03:37,724 --> 00:03:38,724
Bloody hell!

13
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,474
Mr.Amar you are welcome

14
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:54,933
Oh, you can gulp one more sip

15
00:04:22,724 --> 00:04:23,766
Yes Mr Amarnath

16
00:04:24,683 --> 00:04:25,891

17
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,474

00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:32,058
I don’t want any ordinary number

20
00:04:32,558 --> 00:04:33,974
I need some fancy number

21
00:04:34,683 --> 00:04:36,266
You go to RTO and book it

22
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:39,849
However!

23
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:43,308
What you think of me?

24
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:46,558
Am I the only one you have
to perform all the work?

25
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:48,433
Chikka called me the other day

26
00:04:48,808 --> 00:04:51,724
Asked me to repair
water pipes damaged by rats

27
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:53,058
What am I? tell me!

28
00:04:53,808 --> 00:04:54,266
Is it uncle?

29
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:58,266
I called him many times
he didn’t answer

30
00:04:58,641 --> 00:04:59,433
You call him from your number

31
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:01,724
You be quiet, I have work
He gets into my nerve

32
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:03,599

00:05:50,724 --> 00:05:53,058

00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:54,891

55
00:06:06,016 --> 00:06:06,891

66
00:06:49,183 --> 00:06:50,849
We were talking about you only

67
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:53,141

68
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:57,183

You drink in my money at my table

71
00:07:04,016 --> 00:07:06,516
It is quite common to speak about
the person who is absent

00:07:07,891 --> 00:07:11,016
Give me the Vodka with
lime and soda

73
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,016

If I take a heavy breath

94
00:08:23,808 --> 00:08:25,766
Your breathing will cease to exist

95
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:30,641
I am a master in delivering
dialogues and making build ups

96
00:08:31,016 --> 00:08:32,266
Why do I need it?

97
00:08:32,641 --> 00:08:33,308
We are poor people

98
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:38,391
We are happy with what we have

00:08:47,558 --> 00:08:50,016
And Agent Amar in Hong Kong

102
00:08:51,683 --> 00:08:53,474
You want to come in one shot

104
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:04,349

00:09:04,349 --> 00:09:09,349
You dog, call me Amarnath

106
00:09:10,641 --> 00:09:15,224
Only those who love me
can call me Amar

107
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:21,141
Take your seats

108
00:09:37,516 --> 00:09:40,433
Brother, please don’t hit me!

109
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:43,183
Brother! How am I a brother!

110
00:09:43,641 --> 00:09:47,391
There is only one brother in
this town and that is Dr Rajanna

111
00:09:57,641 --> 00:09:59,349
Amar, you are so nice

112
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,016
Thank you

113
00:10:02,099 --> 00:10:04,058
Dude, you wanted to go
to your native, right?

114
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:05,849
Come, I'll drop you
on the way

115
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:08,558
Who ever is going in the end
settle the bill

116
00:10:09,724 --> 00:10:13,683
Amar, everyone says you
cheated. Is it true?

117
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:16,849
What did you just say?!

118
00:10:17,974 --> 00:10:19,724
Everyone says
you are living a fake life

119
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:21,141
I too feel the same

120
00:10:22,474 --> 00:10:24,391
I thought of dropping you
at the bust stop

121
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:26,849
But I didn’t like your question

122
00:10:29,099 --> 00:10:31,141
Do one thing
Take this

123
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:33,641
Take it

124
00:10:36,058 --> 00:10:37,099
Hire a auto and go

125
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:39,099
Get out

126
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:44,308
You are leaving me half the way

127
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:50,224
Too much of ego!

128
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:07,766
Mom, I had dinner
How about you?

129
00:11:11,141 --> 00:11:11,849
Go sleep

130
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:29,683
Happy birthday to you Bobby

131
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:37,433
Amar, I too have an item
to play with you

132
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:50,683
Take it baby

133
00:11:52,891 --> 00:11:56,183
Amar, hereafter
you will lose your sleep

134
00:11:56,558 --> 00:11:58,099
and I will have a sound sleep

135
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:13,058
Oh he is the one!

136
00:13:15,349 --> 00:13:16,683
You said he will make a settlement

137
00:13:21,683 --> 00:13:24,099
But he is posing like a hero!

138
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:25,474
Like a hero!?

139
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:29,308
No chance.. No way

140
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:33,391
I am Hero

141
00:13:34,308 --> 00:13:36,933
I promised my friend that
I’ll settle your debt

142
00:13:37,474 --> 00:13:39,808
and my promise is my life

143
00:13:40,308 --> 00:13:42,724
Its his nature
He is like Karna of Kaliyug

144
00:13:42,891 --> 00:13:45,558
He lives up to his words
He will settle for sure

145
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:48,641
Okay, go collect it
Okay Sir

146
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:57,933
Chikku, tell mom that
settlement is done

147
00:13:58,224 --> 00:13:59,516
Can't leave you alone
You go now

148
00:14:00,349 --> 00:14:03,433
Sir he will pay now
collect it

149
00:14:07,724 --> 00:14:12,516
Who stepped into
my friend’s home first?

150
00:14:23,683 --> 00:14:24,766
What did you say
to mom yesterday?

151
00:14:29,141 --> 00:14:29,516
Hey take this

152
00:14:35,183 --> 00:14:35,849
Hit him

153
00:15:10,808 --> 00:15:13,849
If I punch you
you will get buried underneath

154
00:15:17,058 --> 00:15:19,266
My two lakh worth bike

155
00:15:19,891 --> 00:15:21,141
Sell it and keep
your due amount

156
00:15:28,308 --> 00:15:29,141
Too much dust

157
00:15:30,183 --> 00:15:30,849
Is it?!

158
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:34,224
Dad, it is me who fought

159
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,266
Why do you bother?

160
00:15:37,724 --> 00:15:38,183
Where is the bike?

161
00:15:38,391 --> 00:15:39,141
I gave it away

162
00:15:41,183 --> 00:15:42,183
You gave it?!
Yes

163
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,058
Why did you fight?

164
00:15:44,058 --> 00:15:46,766
Dad leave it. I made
a promise, so I beat them

165
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:50,599
You fought and
gave away the bike?!

166
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:52,558
My promise is my life

167
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:50,266
I like only shorts

168
00:17:00,391 --> 00:17:01,349
Are you out of your mind?

169
00:17:01,891 --> 00:17:03,558
You hit pedestrians

170
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:05,724
Why were you walking on the road?

171
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,683
Don’t you have common sense?

172
00:17:08,974 --> 00:17:11,308
It is you who should have
sense and common sense

173
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:13,266
Is this the way to
dress up for college?

174
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:14,599
Wearing chudi daar

175
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:15,974

But you are dressed up

00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,224
Mind your tongue

179
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,808
You have no rights nor power
to question me

180
00:17:28,058 --> 00:17:30,266
I wear what I want
Why do you bother?

181
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:31,391
Get lost

182
00:17:39,974 --> 00:17:45,308
This world is full of music

183
00:17:47,516 --> 00:17:48,766
I beg you
Who are you?

184
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,558
Oh brain’s smell

a box full of Kaima balls

186
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:57,808

Stomach got shrunk down to zero

187
00:17:57,974 --> 00:17:58,891
You will earn good merits

188
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:01,016
Kindly give me
Rice and Kaima Sir

189
00:18:01,641 --> 00:18:01,891
Wait

190
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,474
I’m taking lunch for my son

191
00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:07,683
Look, I feel pity on you

192
00:18:07,683 --> 00:18:08,433
You must feel

193
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:10,641
He likes two items in this box

194
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:12,016
Chicken curry and ragi ball

195
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,183
I’ll give that to him
and I’ll give you the rest

196
00:18:14,683 --> 00:18:16,391
Before I come back
wash this carrier

197
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:22,474
Thank you Sir

198
00:18:22,724 --> 00:18:24,266
I had a stomach full of lunch

199
00:18:24,474 --> 00:18:25,349
Take it Sir, thanks a lot

200
00:18:27,433 --> 00:18:27,849
You beggar!

201
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:29,183
You are dressed up like this!

202
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:33,599
Brother in law!
Who is Brother in law?

203
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:36,099
It’s me in-law

204
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:41,599
I’ve seen you before

205
00:18:42,641 --> 00:18:43,891
I’m your wife’s younger brother

206
00:18:47,766 --> 00:18:48,599
You are my Sudha’s brother?!

207
00:18:49,349 --> 00:18:50,349
What happened to you?

208
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:51,599
What to do brother in law?

209
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:54,183
I have no job in hometown

210
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,558
So I came in search of you

211
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:58,391
If you allow me to stay in
your home

212
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:59,724
And get me a good job

213
00:18:59,974 --> 00:19:01,683
I can live independently

214
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:02,933
Please in-law

215
00:19:03,391 --> 00:19:06,099
If you don’t, my situation will become
the same which you saw earlier

216
00:19:06,308 --> 00:19:08,099
You want that to happen?
Please in-law

217
00:19:13,183 --> 00:19:15,349
Home is very beautiful
from now on, I am

218
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,058
Guess who?

219
00:19:21,641 --> 00:19:22,308
Your younger brother

220
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:24,391
My younger brother?
Sudhakar’s son

221
00:19:25,266 --> 00:19:27,099
Brother, its you!

222
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:31,724
But, it was said 'you got drowned

223
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:32,599
Yes, I drowned

224
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:34,558
But came out
not to pollute the water

225
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,433
I’m glad to see you brother

226
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:39,974
Thank God, you survived!

227
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:42,058
Amar, come fast

228
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,308
My son, just now he came back
from the college

229
00:19:44,724 --> 00:19:45,016
Amar

230
00:19:48,641 --> 00:19:52,808
Sister, he’s tall like
a coconut tree!

231
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:57,349
He would have touched the sky
if he had grown few more inches

232
00:19:58,808 --> 00:19:59,308
Uncle?!

233
00:19:59,683 --> 00:20:00,558
He is your uncle

234
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,391
Uncle?!

235
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:04,724
He is my uncle’s son

236
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:08,224
when we were kids, we used to
play hopscotch in our town

237
00:20:08,224 --> 00:20:09,391
Hopscotch.. on one leg

238
00:20:09,516 --> 00:20:10,599
Sister remembers everything

239
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:13,933
Just a minute
I’ll prepare coffee

240
00:20:13,974 --> 00:20:15,183
I’m hungry sister, lunch?

241
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:15,891
Lunch?!

242
00:20:16,058 --> 00:20:17,183
You don’t understand
keep quite

243
00:20:17,474 --> 00:20:18,308
Sister, make it hot

244
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:19,099
I’ll prepare it
Make it fast

245
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,391
You too talk
I go change the dress

246
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:25,933
I must hug him somehow

247
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,391
What to do?
Yes I got it

248
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:31,849
If I impress you
my life will be settled

249
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:33,266
Great

250
00:20:34,391 --> 00:20:37,016
You are so tall!
How to find a girl for you?

251
00:20:38,516 --> 00:20:39,641
God knows where she is!

252
00:20:39,849 --> 00:20:42,391
Hi guys
Hi

253
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:44,266
Hi

254
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:45,891
This is Sandy
from Royal Enfield

255
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:47,099
Hi everyone

256
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:48,891
As discussed with Bobby

257
00:20:49,224 --> 00:20:50,724
This rally is gonna start
from Manipal

258
00:20:51,058 --> 00:20:53,891
It’s gonna go through
Madikeri, Sultan Bateri

259
00:20:54,224 --> 00:20:55,058
Guess where its gonna end?

260
00:20:55,224 --> 00:20:56,724
Its gonna end at Ooty

261
00:20:57,558 --> 00:21:01,099
As you all know, we need to
plant 1000 amplinks

262
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:03,183
The trees are very important to us

263
00:21:04,141 --> 00:21:05,558
We must send this message
to public

264
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:05,891
Excuse me

265
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:06,641
What?

266
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,224
Its a very ordinary idea

267
00:21:08,349 --> 00:21:09,141
You have a better one?

268
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:09,974
Your idea is okay

269
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:11,974
But execution is not convincing

270
00:21:12,724 --> 00:21:14,141
We will plant and leave

271
00:21:14,516 --> 00:21:16,058
But who will look after them?

272
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:17,224
Whose gonna take care of it?

273
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:18,891
Does anyone have a ball?

274
00:21:18,974 --> 00:21:20,266
Kavitha, he is asking for
a ball. Give him

275
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:24,599
Amar
Catch it

276
00:21:26,474 --> 00:21:27,016
Seed ball

277
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:30,308
I’m not claiming this idea
as mine or new

278
00:21:31,183 --> 00:21:32,558
Our ancestors used to apply this

279
00:21:32,974 --> 00:21:35,183
Adding manure and
fertilised soil in the water

280
00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:37,516
Place a seed in it

281
00:21:37,724 --> 00:21:39,766
Shape it like a ball

282
00:21:40,183 --> 00:21:42,349
This way they used to
store thousands of balls

283
00:21:42,933 --> 00:21:46,183
We should throw these balls
in an open ground

284
00:21:46,474 --> 00:21:49,599
Balls dissolve naturally
in rainy season

285
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:50,849
Seed sprouts

286
00:21:51,183 --> 00:21:54,266
Grows into a plant
and grows into a tree

287
00:21:54,724 --> 00:21:56,141
If we execute this idea

288
00:21:56,474 --> 00:21:57,891
We will get the best results

289
00:21:58,308 --> 00:21:59,058
Sometimes

290
00:21:59,808 --> 00:22:01,474
Stupid people have good ideas

291
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:03,808
if you talk in between
your work will not be done

292
00:22:04,266 --> 00:22:05,891
It’s my responsibly to
get your job done

293
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,599
Don’t forget to pay
my 10 percent cut

294
00:22:08,141 --> 00:22:09,683
Hi Amar

295
00:22:09,683 --> 00:22:10,516
How are you?
Hi uncle

296
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:12,016
How come you are with Chandra?

297
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:13,683
What’s the occasion?

298
00:22:17,808 --> 00:22:18,266
You smarty!

299
00:22:19,183 --> 00:22:20,599
He resemble his dad
isn’t he?!

300
00:22:20,766 --> 00:22:21,433
How come you are with uncle?

301
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:23,016
You talk

302
00:22:24,891 --> 00:22:27,849
Look, he is your friend
not my friend

303
00:22:28,141 --> 00:22:29,641
But he is in trouble

304
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:32,141
He has a baby
it has a whole in the heart

305
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:36,349
It is difficult for him to get it
operated in his earnings

306
00:22:36,849 --> 00:22:40,099
He thinks he can earn more
if he drives Ola or Uber

307
00:22:40,474 --> 00:22:41,724
But he has no licence

308
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:44,099
He has no white patch card

309
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,974
But you have it

310
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:45,933
It was him who told me that

311
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:49,016
Chikka told me that
you are Karna of Kaliyug

312
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:53,558
Entire Karnataka knows
you keep up your promises

313
00:22:53,849 --> 00:22:55,516
Give me your hand

314
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:56,433
Promise me

315
00:22:57,183 --> 00:22:58,474
You are giving your white patch to him

316
00:22:58,849 --> 00:22:59,683
Okay?

317
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:01,516
Give me your wallet

318
00:23:02,058 --> 00:23:02,433
Wallet?

319
00:23:02,433 --> 00:23:04,558
Give me. I should know
what to give him

320
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:05,974
Yes, what you need?
Take it

321
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:12,974
Lead biker will be
leading us in the rally

322
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:16,183
The lead biker will be
checking out in front

323
00:23:16,183 --> 00:23:17,724
To avoid obstacles

324
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:20,599
We bikers will be
behind him in two lines

325
00:23:20,891 --> 00:23:23,308
Behind us there will be
two ambulances and work stations

326
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:24,724
At the end, there will be
a tail biker

327
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:27,849
Helicams should be used
only in permitted places

328
00:23:28,308 --> 00:23:30,849
Gps which will be provided to
everyone must be in on mode

329
00:23:31,349 --> 00:23:33,224
Everyone must ride
at the speed fixed by us

330
00:23:33,641 --> 00:23:34,849
Safety is important

331
00:23:35,308 --> 00:23:40,099
In the blue sky, clouds of
dreams are melting down

332
00:23:40,224 --> 00:23:43,599
As rain drops, as life support

333
00:23:44,974 --> 00:23:49,724
Colourful boat reached the shore

334
00:23:49,849 --> 00:23:53,391
as light
as light of life

335
00:24:13,808 --> 00:24:17,141
Greetings, as you all know
Cities exist if forests exists

336
00:24:17,641 --> 00:24:19,474
In fact, we are all beggars

337
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:20,974
No matter how rich we are

338
00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:24,974
Oxygen they get is the charity
made by this Earth, nature

339
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:29,974
Therefore we should
grow plants and save trees

340
00:24:30,433 --> 00:24:31,433
We must protect forests

341
00:24:31,808 --> 00:24:35,183
We should destroy those
who destroy forests

342
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:36,683
Stop it madam

343
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,266
We villagers are
not destroying the forest

344
00:24:39,266 --> 00:24:42,183
It is you. City dwellers are doing it

345
00:24:42,391 --> 00:24:45,224
Don’t rise your hand
Bring down your hand

346
00:24:46,016 --> 00:24:50,349
We know that the forest need to be saved
tress and plants are needed

347
00:24:50,349 --> 00:24:51,266
Stop it mister

348
00:24:51,683 --> 00:24:52,183
What’s your problem?

349
00:24:52,183 --> 00:24:53,516
Forest is destroyed already

350
00:24:53,724 --> 00:24:55,266
We have come here to stop
the future destruction

351
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:59,808
It is the responsibility of cities, taluks and
panchayat to save forests

352
00:24:59,891 --> 00:25:01,641
We are not asking it for our sake

353
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:05,266
We are telling to save
for the coming generations

354
00:25:05,766 --> 00:25:06,599
Please try to understand

355
00:25:15,683 --> 00:25:17,183
Why she is drenching in rain?

356
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,308
Who will take care of her
if she falls sick

357
00:25:20,058 --> 00:25:20,933
Its a forest moreover!

358
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:25,808
Why are you drenching in rain?

359
00:25:26,266 --> 00:25:27,141
It’s raining heavy!

360
00:25:27,766 --> 00:25:30,016
You might fall sick

361
00:25:30,683 --> 00:25:31,308
Lets get inside

362
00:25:31,974 --> 00:25:33,599
My wish. why do you bother?

363
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:35,516
For your sake

364
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:37,141
Enough

365
00:25:37,433 --> 00:25:39,183
At least, hold the umbrella

366
00:25:49,058 --> 00:25:50,599
He is irritating me unnecessarily

367
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,561
Amar Bobby is serious
I was taking her to the hospital

368
00:26:19,853 --> 00:26:21,436
Ambulance broke down
will you come down here?

369
00:26:21,436 --> 00:26:23,561
Oaky, share me the location

370
00:26:30,853 --> 00:26:31,770
Stop

371
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,645
She is inside

00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:37,103

373
00:26:51,228 --> 00:26:53,311

00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,561
Friends, please come on

375
00:27:09,936 --> 00:27:11,228
He’s been very kind to us

376
00:27:11,895 --> 00:27:15,936
He helped when Bobby was in trouble
he helped you when you had break down

377
00:27:16,395 --> 00:27:17,811
So Bobby will add few words

378
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,270
Guys, our next stop is in Gudloor

379
00:27:21,436 --> 00:27:24,061
So weather is good. so lets leave
let's not waste time

380
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:25,228
Yeah come on

381
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:42,936
We distributed T-shirts to everyone

382
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:44,603
One is left

383
00:27:44,978 --> 00:27:45,353
Is it?

384
00:27:45,686 --> 00:27:46,353
Who is missing?

385
00:27:46,645 --> 00:27:50,186
Like teachers day, Fathers day,
Love day, today is Blue day

386
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:52,811
Go with them wearing blue shirt

387
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,186
I’ll go home wearing this T-shirt

388
00:27:55,186 --> 00:27:55,811
Why man?

389
00:27:56,436 --> 00:27:59,936
They brought us here and that lady
behaves odd that bald behaves weird

390
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,561
They promised alcohol but
didn’t provide a single drop

391
00:28:02,686 --> 00:28:03,686
I’ll not participate in this ride

392
00:28:04,228 --> 00:28:04,811
Who is missing?

393
00:28:04,853 --> 00:28:06,895
Madam, Vishwas is missing

394
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:08,270
Missing?

395
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,895
Now we are going to go see

396
00:28:10,228 --> 00:28:11,811
A beautiful weather!

397
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,978
Comma, fifty bikers

398
00:28:15,478 --> 00:28:16,103
Comma

399
00:28:16,936 --> 00:28:19,270
Ten beautiful girls

400
00:28:19,436 --> 00:28:20,436
Comma

401
00:28:20,686 --> 00:28:21,103
Comma!?

402
00:28:21,311 --> 00:28:26,478
If you go in Bullet like Dr. Rajkumar
in Naa ninna mareyalare

403
00:28:26,978 --> 00:28:27,895
Comma

404
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,145
Kavitha next you

405
00:28:30,603 --> 00:28:35,895
Her bullet sounds vroom
Her heart sounds Chikku Chikku

406
00:28:36,686 --> 00:28:38,645
Comma!
Comma!

407
00:28:38,645 --> 00:28:40,395
A beautiful duet song of you both

408
00:28:41,228 --> 00:28:43,061
Comma!
Comma!

409
00:28:43,061 --> 00:28:48,020
I will never forget you

410
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:49,228
How is it?

411
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,270
Beauty
Then take it

412
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:55,103
Comma
Kavitha come on

413
00:28:56,811 --> 00:28:58,311
Amar, Vishwas is missing

414
00:28:58,728 --> 00:29:01,853
Tired to contact over phone
and walky-talky but not reachable

415
00:29:02,186 --> 00:29:04,311
I’ll track in GPS
You get ready

416
00:29:09,145 --> 00:29:19,603
Vishwas

417
00:29:22,311 --> 00:29:23,061
Hey wait. stop

418
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:24,436
Stop

419
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:32,936
Vishwas

420
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:40,436
Vishwas

421
00:29:44,728 --> 00:29:47,145
Vishwas

422
00:29:50,936 --> 00:29:52,686
Please help me

423
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,770
Amar, could you help us
Can you save him?

424
00:30:10,478 --> 00:30:13,103
Bobby, if anything goes wrong
we both have to go behind the bars

425
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,561
Sandy, pass the message in walky

426
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,770
Vishwas is missing

427
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,895
Come back in the root we took
we are in the same spot

428
00:30:23,228 --> 00:30:26,270
Bobby, if anything goes wrong
we both have to go behind the bars

429
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:31,978
Please help me

430
00:30:32,395 --> 00:30:35,645
Dude, we could only hear his voice
But he is not seen any where near

431
00:30:36,395 --> 00:30:39,270
Does she think me as
a cinema hero to save him?!

432
00:30:39,936 --> 00:30:42,686
I am the only son to
my parents. What if I die?!

433
00:30:42,728 --> 00:30:44,853
Amar, please help me

434
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:33,895
We found Vishwas

435
00:31:39,103 --> 00:31:39,603
Come on, let’s see

436
00:31:43,353 --> 00:31:44,520
Amar found him

437
00:31:45,395 --> 00:31:48,186
You found him using
my idea, superb!

438
00:31:48,561 --> 00:31:50,478
I’ll bring him up
Take off your pants

439
00:31:50,936 --> 00:31:52,061
Pant? Why?

440
00:31:55,478 --> 00:31:57,061
Hey, I have seen it in that cinema

441
00:31:57,811 --> 00:32:00,853
Save him by using
the pant, correct?

442
00:32:00,978 --> 00:32:03,228
Yes I figured it out
Wait, I’ll take it off

443
00:32:06,978 --> 00:32:09,270
Take it. Wait
I’ll bring everyone’s pant

444
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,895
Take off your pants everyone

445
00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:13,895
Kavitha, take off your pant

446
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:15,978
Get lost

447
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,520
Amar, why did you take
my pant alone?

448
00:32:26,853 --> 00:32:31,061
Cold wind is blowing heavily!
Hell with this Ooty

449
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:35,061
He took my pant
Wind is getting into my bones

450
00:32:35,478 --> 00:32:36,145
Amar

451
00:32:38,728 --> 00:32:39,478
Amar

452
00:32:41,103 --> 00:32:41,728
Can’t see him

453
00:32:42,228 --> 00:32:43,853
Look through the drone camera
give me  the exact location

454
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:44,728
Ya okay Amar

455
00:32:48,978 --> 00:32:50,811
He took my pant
and made me half naked

456
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:54,061
Not able to sit in front of girls
not able to walk around men

457
00:32:54,978 --> 00:32:58,728
This bald is staring at me weirdly

458
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:02,853
Out of desperation
he is staring at my thighs!

459
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,853
Amar, please help me

460
00:33:49,978 --> 00:33:52,103
You are superb. you saved his life
You are really great!

461
00:33:54,895 --> 00:33:57,728
Why did you take my pant alone?

462
00:33:58,978 --> 00:34:01,395
So that, two leeches
can bite your bum

463
00:34:02,978 --> 00:34:03,895
Where is my pant?

464
00:34:04,978 --> 00:34:07,145
I threw it
You threw it! I hate you

465
00:34:09,186 --> 00:34:09,770
I love you

466
00:34:11,103 --> 00:34:12,603
Bring me some water
Wait, I’ll bring

467
00:34:29,936 --> 00:34:30,686
Thank you Amar

468
00:35:09,311 --> 00:35:11,520
Why are behaving like this?
Sit quietly

469
00:35:14,728 --> 00:35:16,895
Dude, this is the right time!

470
00:35:18,603 --> 00:35:19,020
What for?

471
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:21,603
To test her love

472
00:35:24,186 --> 00:35:24,603
How?!

473
00:35:25,895 --> 00:35:26,811
Clouds have gathered

474
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,520
About to rain any moment

475
00:35:31,145 --> 00:35:34,061
She will be standing like this
under the rain

476
00:35:34,478 --> 00:35:37,020
You will go there
stand next to her

477
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:41,853
Unexpectedly a thunder will strike

478
00:35:42,228 --> 00:35:46,353
She will get frightened
and she will hug you

479
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:49,978
Shut up man!
I’ve seen it many movies

480
00:35:50,186 --> 00:35:51,686
Every cinema has the same plot

481
00:35:53,936 --> 00:35:57,478
See, I predicted the rain
Come on get up

482
00:35:57,811 --> 00:35:59,811
What are you thinking?
Go now

483
00:36:00,895 --> 00:36:01,353
All the best

484
00:36:01,853 --> 00:36:04,436
He found one. Wish I find
a girl for me!

485
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:12,436
Doctor has instructed her
not to get drenched in rain

486
00:36:15,061 --> 00:36:16,603
Have to convince her politely

487
00:36:32,395 --> 00:36:33,228
Will you make a promise to me?

488
00:36:38,728 --> 00:36:39,061
Come here

489
00:36:52,603 --> 00:36:54,728
Actually, I am nearing death

490
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:57,936
What do you mean?

491
00:37:00,103 --> 00:37:03,311
Death may strike me any moment

492
00:37:05,145 --> 00:37:06,186
6 days

493
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,603
6 weeks

494
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,853
6 years
I don’t know

495
00:37:18,353 --> 00:37:19,811
So if you have anything in your mind

496
00:37:23,228 --> 00:37:24,186
Please don’t go ahead

497
00:37:31,478 --> 00:37:32,353
I have cancer

498
00:37:36,561 --> 00:37:37,478
What? Cancer!

499
00:37:47,311 --> 00:37:49,311
No one from this group
must come to know about this

500
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,020
If they come to know
they will treat me differently

501
00:37:54,103 --> 00:37:54,895
It irritates me

502
00:37:55,353 --> 00:37:56,770
And I don’t want
anybodies sympathy

503
00:37:58,478 --> 00:38:03,020
That’s why, I live my life
Bold, carefree, fast biking

504
00:38:04,686 --> 00:38:07,353
Actually, you are a fabulous guy

505
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,395
But I cant be in love with you
Find someone

506
00:38:13,895 --> 00:38:14,186
Good luck

507
00:38:45,395 --> 00:38:47,061
So sad! I
She has cancer!

508
00:38:47,645 --> 00:38:49,311
I misunderstood her till now

509
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:57,728
Bobby. I love her too much

510
00:38:58,978 --> 00:38:59,645
What does she like?

511
00:38:59,936 --> 00:39:04,186
Boat, ship and cruise

512
00:39:04,478 --> 00:39:06,520
She like everything
which floats on water

513
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,436
Rain and puppies

514
00:39:08,895 --> 00:39:09,353
Sandy

515
00:39:11,061 --> 00:39:11,978
Ya Amar
Sandy

516
00:39:12,395 --> 00:39:13,520
Its going to rain heavily

517
00:39:13,895 --> 00:39:14,478
will be covered with mist

518
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,853
According to me crossing 80
is not a good idea

519
00:39:18,103 --> 00:39:19,603
Ask the lead not to cross 80
Sure

520
00:39:20,728 --> 00:39:21,228
What? 80?!

521
00:39:21,353 --> 00:39:23,978
You are a fool!
90 suits well in this weather

522
00:39:23,978 --> 00:39:24,603
Chikku

523
00:39:26,395 --> 00:39:27,853
Chikku, excuse us one moment

524
00:39:28,728 --> 00:39:29,353
Come this side

525
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,645
Talk to me in English
I know English

526
00:39:33,061 --> 00:39:33,395
Amar

527
00:39:34,853 --> 00:39:35,936
I am observing you

528
00:39:36,353 --> 00:39:37,895
You are showing a lot of
concern towards me

529
00:39:38,061 --> 00:39:39,645
I'm getting suffocated
due to this

530
00:39:40,061 --> 00:39:43,061
Please don’t do it
I love speed, okay?

531
00:39:43,811 --> 00:39:46,853
I’ll ride in full speed
120.. 140..

532
00:39:47,061 --> 00:39:48,145
Please don’t follow me

533
00:40:23,228 --> 00:40:25,686
Amar, I told you not to follow me

534
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,145
I told you not to follow me

535
00:40:28,436 --> 00:40:29,603
Don’t mess with my life

536
00:40:29,811 --> 00:40:31,603
If you are in love with me
that’s not my problem

537
00:40:31,853 --> 00:40:33,936
But I can’t
Just leave me alone

538
00:40:44,936 --> 00:40:45,436
Bobby

539
00:40:46,103 --> 00:40:49,561
You live for just 6 days 6 weeks
6 moths or live for 6 years

540
00:40:49,936 --> 00:40:51,353
You are the only girl in my life

541
00:40:52,353 --> 00:40:53,061
I love you

542
00:40:58,228 --> 00:40:59,853
You will be with me
even in my death

543
00:41:13,561 --> 00:41:14,520
When we were in first semester

544
00:41:15,478 --> 00:41:18,145
Since you danced with me
in the college function

545
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:20,436
I did not like you

546
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,103
I thought you were an irresponsible
fellow and a rude person

547
00:41:24,978 --> 00:41:28,186
But you are a sweet and
good heated person

548
00:41:31,228 --> 00:41:33,686
Friends, we are coming
to the end of this rally

549
00:41:33,978 --> 00:41:35,436
And tomorrow is the last day

550
00:41:35,561 --> 00:41:36,978
And on behalf of us all

551
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,436
I am thanking
Mr. Sandy for his support

552
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,686
And Amar, thank you so much

553
00:41:46,728 --> 00:41:50,645
I want to travel forever with you
in the journey of life

554
00:41:51,811 --> 00:41:53,561
I want to be with you like this

555
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:55,770
Together... Forever

556
00:42:42,186 --> 00:42:44,686
Okay guys, let’s move
Keep in touch

557
00:42:44,686 --> 00:42:46,270
Bye Chikku, take care

558
00:42:46,978 --> 00:42:49,020
Dad, our rally came to an end
we are leaving

559
00:42:57,895 --> 00:42:58,728
I have dialled my number

560
00:42:59,228 --> 00:43:01,270
Now I’ve your number
You have mine

561
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:04,020
You must reply to my messages
Answer whenever I call

562
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,645
You must meet
whenever I say. Okay?

563
00:43:06,895 --> 00:43:07,228
See you

564
00:43:14,811 --> 00:43:17,020
I’ll be waiting in Mall
Come fast

565
00:43:36,353 --> 00:43:51,353
I became a lover by
gazing at you

566
00:43:51,645 --> 00:43:58,686
Let the soul depart
if you are in my arm

567
00:43:59,686 --> 00:44:03,228
Let eras pass by

568
00:44:03,853 --> 00:44:08,186
I’ll born again to be with you

569
00:44:52,645 --> 00:44:56,645
I forget the world often

570
00:45:00,811 --> 00:45:04,770
I reach somewhere else
than the destiny

571
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:13,395
Every step you keep
is delightful from distance

572
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:23,895
I tend to announce to the world
that you are my paradise

573
00:45:28,103 --> 00:45:29,853
Why she is not
answering my call?

574
00:45:50,145 --> 00:45:51,311
What the hell is wrong with you?

575
00:45:52,145 --> 00:45:54,978
I’m calling you from morning
Don’t you have sense to call back?

576
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:56,353
Will you listen to me Amar?

577
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:58,353
No, I’l not listen to you
Listen to yourself

578
00:45:58,936 --> 00:45:59,603
Did I not tell you

579
00:45:59,936 --> 00:46:01,936
You must reply to my texts
Answer my calls

580
00:46:01,978 --> 00:46:03,686
You must meet whenever I say

581
00:46:03,978 --> 00:46:05,395
I was in the hospital from morning

582
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:07,728
I didn't have my phone with me

583
00:46:09,478 --> 00:46:11,645
Do you know how hard it was for me
when you did not receive my call?

584
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:13,686
N number of thoughts
popped up in my mind

585
00:46:13,978 --> 00:46:16,228
Where did she go?
what happened? this and that

586
00:46:16,478 --> 00:46:18,103
I’m waiting in college campus
Come immediately

587
00:46:23,811 --> 00:46:24,395
Freaking idiot

588
00:46:40,728 --> 00:46:42,436
I’m talking to you
Are you deaf?

589
00:46:42,686 --> 00:46:43,728
Why are you not responding?

590
00:46:44,311 --> 00:46:44,603
Stop it

591
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:46,311
Why do you keep saying
the same?

592
00:46:46,895 --> 00:46:47,978
You always ask me

593
00:46:49,353 --> 00:46:51,603
Why I drench in rain?

594
00:46:52,145 --> 00:46:54,561
I really want to tell you now

595
00:46:55,853 --> 00:46:58,895
I was a kid
might be around ten years

596
00:46:59,436 --> 00:47:02,311
I lost my mother
she died out of cancer

597
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,895
Actually, my mom loved rain

598
00:47:05,603 --> 00:47:07,936
Whenever rained, she used to
drag me out of the house

599
00:47:08,561 --> 00:47:10,061
and we both used to
stand in the rain

600
00:47:10,353 --> 00:47:14,520
We used to rejoice drenching
and playing in the rain

601
00:47:15,145 --> 00:47:17,770
Now, I am missing her
too much

602
00:47:18,311 --> 00:47:21,103
Since then
I stand like this in rain

603
00:47:21,603 --> 00:47:23,853
In fact, I feel like

604
00:47:25,478 --> 00:47:29,936
my mom is blessing me
in the form of rain

605
00:47:32,103 --> 00:47:33,436
My father is a great man

606
00:47:34,895 --> 00:47:36,436
When he came to know
my mom has cancer

607
00:47:37,395 --> 00:47:39,436
he took very good care of her

608
00:47:40,228 --> 00:47:43,728
Family members forced him
for second marriage

609
00:47:45,145 --> 00:47:48,061
But he didn’t. He sacrificed
all his happiness for me

610
00:47:49,395 --> 00:47:51,728
Many guys proposed me

611
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:55,936
But when I used to tell them
that I’ve cancer

612
00:47:56,228 --> 00:47:57,895
Those who proposed stepped back

613
00:47:59,728 --> 00:48:05,103
Few were behind for my richness

614
00:48:07,561 --> 00:48:08,728
But you are really special

615
00:48:10,103 --> 00:48:11,895
When you came to know
that I’ve cancer

616
00:48:13,061 --> 00:48:14,228
You started caring for me

617
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:21,020
In you I found
the quality of my father

618
00:48:21,478 --> 00:48:22,520
You are really special

619
00:48:23,645 --> 00:48:24,853
I need to tell you the truth

620
00:48:25,895 --> 00:48:29,645
I don’t have cancer

621
00:48:30,228 --> 00:48:33,270
I just played that
cancer trick with you too

622
00:48:46,561 --> 00:48:46,936
Amar

623
00:48:49,728 --> 00:48:53,811
Whether I live for 6 days
6 months or for 6 years

624
00:48:54,895 --> 00:48:57,645
You are the only guy in my life

625
00:49:02,561 --> 00:49:02,895
Amar

626
00:49:03,853 --> 00:49:05,478
Will you be with me
even in my death?

627
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:14,936
I love you Amar

628
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:26,103
Bobby

629
00:49:27,603 --> 00:49:29,228
This will be our
meeting spot from now on

630
00:49:29,853 --> 00:49:30,270
You like it?

631
00:49:30,728 --> 00:49:31,311
Really?
Of course Bobb

632
00:49:31,561 --> 00:49:32,936
Yes of course it's for you

633
00:49:33,436 --> 00:49:35,020
I got it ready
because you like it

634
00:49:35,311 --> 00:49:36,228
I love you

635
00:49:36,728 --> 00:49:51,853
I became a lover by
gazing at you

636
00:50:33,145 --> 00:50:37,186
The very first experience of
drenching in rain

637
00:50:41,228 --> 00:50:45,103
You are recalling it back to back

638
00:50:46,895 --> 00:50:53,853
In hundreds and
thousands of evening

639
00:50:54,936 --> 00:50:58,811
Sitting next you
listening to your talks

640
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:04,603
Let the death come to me
in that moment

641
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:22,020
I became a lover by
gazing at you

642
00:51:24,775 --> 00:51:27,192
That his son goes by walk
for not having the bike

643
00:51:27,525 --> 00:51:28,942
Your dad brought back your bike

644
00:51:32,108 --> 00:51:32,650
Love you dad

645
00:51:35,733 --> 00:51:36,275
I love you ma

646
00:51:38,483 --> 00:51:40,483
Mom, you used to ask me
to make a promise

647
00:51:41,483 --> 00:51:42,942
You tell me the promise

648
00:51:43,692 --> 00:51:44,483
I’ll promise whatever it is

649
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:47,608
Really?

650
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,108
Yes, tell me mom

651
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:52,983
You should never again

652
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:56,525
Amar

653
00:51:58,067 --> 00:51:58,358
Tell me

654
00:51:58,858 --> 00:51:59,692
We need to enquire you

655
00:52:00,483 --> 00:52:00,942
Come with me

656
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:02,567
Regarding?

657
00:52:02,983 --> 00:52:04,483
Explanations will be given
at the station

658
00:52:05,858 --> 00:52:06,442
Yes sweetheart

659
00:52:06,608 --> 00:52:09,442
Police came home
took Amar to police station

660
00:52:09,608 --> 00:52:11,358
What? Police? Why?

661
00:52:11,483 --> 00:52:13,733
I asked them why
but they did not answer

662
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:15,567
Amar told me to stay at home

663
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,108
Okay. I’ll call you back
once I reach

664
00:52:17,275 --> 00:52:17,983
Where are you?

665
00:52:18,317 --> 00:52:19,692
I’m in Mangalore
I’ll leave immediately

666
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:20,442
Make it fast

667
00:52:27,233 --> 00:52:29,150
Licence and documents
are in your name

668
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:30,775
What's your alibi?

669
00:52:32,442 --> 00:52:35,858
Where are you keeping
the robbed amount of 15 lakh?

670
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:44,983
Your son got caught by the police
for committing robbery

671
00:52:45,233 --> 00:52:46,150
It is getting telecasted in Tv

672
00:52:46,775 --> 00:52:48,192
Welcome to Tv9 News

673
00:52:48,567 --> 00:52:50,233
In recent days, college students are

674
00:52:50,525 --> 00:52:53,650
engaging in criminal activities
for bad habits

675
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:59,567
Today a college student named
Amar has committed a robbery

676
00:53:05,733 --> 00:53:07,817
Real robber got caught
with cash

677
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:08,150
Is it?

678
00:53:16,567 --> 00:53:18,442
This is the guy
who robbed the money

679
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:28,483
Sometimes mistakes happen
during enquiry

680
00:53:28,983 --> 00:53:29,942
Yourself?
Fiancé

681
00:53:30,483 --> 00:53:31,025
You can take him

682
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:32,775
Sir

683
00:53:35,233 --> 00:53:38,233
You say mistakes happen
during enquiry

684
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:39,650
But what about our parents pain?

685
00:53:40,025 --> 00:53:43,150
You must admit to my dad that
his son has done nothing wrong

686
00:53:44,233 --> 00:53:45,233
Okay, it’s okay

687
00:53:46,525 --> 00:53:48,400
You wait in the jeep
I’ll come

688
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:50,692
You bloody rascal!

689
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:53,483
I’ll talk to Amar for
two minutes, please

690
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:55,900
Do you think this place
is your home?

691
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:56,900
This is a police station

692
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,233
Sir I beg you

693
00:54:00,858 --> 00:54:02,358
Seize the cash
and take him into custody

694
00:54:02,733 --> 00:54:03,608
Let him talk for two minutes

695
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:07,108
Sorry dude

696
00:54:08,608 --> 00:54:09,317
You did a mistake

697
00:54:10,317 --> 00:54:15,150
Nothing mattered much
compared to my daughter

698
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:16,442
My life is over now

699
00:54:17,692 --> 00:54:18,317
Behind the bars

700
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:20,983
Amar, will you give me
your word

701
00:54:23,108 --> 00:54:24,150
Will you save my daughter?

702
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:28,442
Dude

703
00:55:39,067 --> 00:55:40,400
I did not do anything wrong

704
00:55:42,025 --> 00:55:44,150
I swear on you
I did not do anything wrong

705
00:55:45,733 --> 00:55:46,942
Dad, ask him

706
00:55:50,983 --> 00:55:52,733
Tell my dad that
I did not do anything wrong

707
00:55:54,358 --> 00:55:55,025
Tell him

708
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:02,733
Tell him Sir

709
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,025
Your son did not do
anything wrong

710
00:56:16,817 --> 00:56:18,483
Your son is innocent

711
00:56:19,067 --> 00:56:19,567
Forgive me

712
00:56:29,192 --> 00:56:29,733
Okay Sir

713
00:56:31,192 --> 00:56:35,400
Will my husband come back?

714
00:56:36,733 --> 00:56:37,483
Tell me, will he come back?

715
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:57,567
Dad

716
00:56:59,692 --> 00:57:00,525
You left us?!

717
00:57:05,233 --> 00:57:08,983
Don’t worry dad
I’ll take good care of mom

718
00:57:11,442 --> 00:57:12,150
I promise you

719
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:39,108
For that child’s wellness
I made you sign

720
00:57:40,608 --> 00:57:42,483
I didn’t expect this would happen

721
00:57:44,608 --> 00:57:45,900
Please forgive me

722
00:57:48,692 --> 00:57:51,983
It is nobody’s fault, uncle

723
00:57:55,567 --> 00:57:58,567
Somehow we have to arrange the money
for that child's operation

724
00:58:01,525 --> 00:58:05,567
Amar, the ways you are trying
will not get you money

725
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:09,275
Those are all wrong ways
But there is a way

726
00:58:09,608 --> 00:58:10,983
There is a bike race in Coimbatore

727
00:58:10,983 --> 00:58:12,358
15 lakhs for the winner!
Race?!

728
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:16,817
I can perform bike stunts
but I never raced

729
00:58:17,108 --> 00:58:18,442
Amar you can

730
00:58:37,233 --> 00:58:39,733
Hey hi!
How are you guys?

731
00:58:44,025 --> 00:58:46,025
Hey it’s Amar!
Look at that!

732
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:09,983
Come on Amar
You can do it

733
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:25,692
Amar

734
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:13,192
Come on dude

735
01:00:57,067 --> 01:01:01,108
Faster.. Faster

736
01:01:19,525 --> 01:01:19,858
Bobby

737
01:01:21,817 --> 01:01:22,567
Mr Amar is fine

738
01:01:23,817 --> 01:01:24,775
He will recover very soon

739
01:01:25,442 --> 01:01:26,025
Thank you doctor

740
01:01:26,108 --> 01:01:26,692
You can see him now

741
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:35,983
Amar

742
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:47,150
I am sorry

743
01:01:50,608 --> 01:01:51,358
I love your guts

744
01:01:52,025 --> 01:01:54,650
Winning and losing in a game
Is all part of life

745
01:01:55,233 --> 01:01:56,108
For your happiness

746
01:01:58,733 --> 01:02:01,567
and for child’s sake
i should have won

747
01:02:01,858 --> 01:02:03,525
I always feel happy by seeing you

748
01:02:05,358 --> 01:02:05,983
Cheer up

749
01:02:06,817 --> 01:02:09,067
I know you are
a self-esteemed person

750
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,858
There is a lot of fund
in my dad’s office

751
01:02:12,692 --> 01:02:14,650
I’ll ask him regarding
child’s operation

752
01:02:15,067 --> 01:02:16,817
You will pay back, so he will give you

753
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:23,192
I don’t want to ask money or
favour from your dad

754
01:02:23,317 --> 01:02:24,192
So what Amar?!

755
01:02:26,858 --> 01:02:28,358
Payback after some time

756
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:46,733
Amar

757
01:02:47,733 --> 01:02:52,108
My dad fixed my engagement
all of a sudden

758
01:02:53,192 --> 01:02:54,025
That too on next Sunday

759
01:02:55,067 --> 01:02:55,858
How can I react?!

760
01:02:57,025 --> 01:02:57,858
I was very angry

761
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,817
but I controlled my self

762
01:03:01,233 --> 01:03:02,108
I ran to you

763
01:03:02,608 --> 01:03:06,567
Poor him, he doesn’t know
How much I love you

764
01:03:08,608 --> 01:03:12,150
Some friend’s son it seems
A doctor in Scotland

765
01:03:12,608 --> 01:03:13,650
So I decided

766
01:03:15,817 --> 01:03:17,608
to run away far from here

767
01:03:26,858 --> 01:03:27,233
Amar

768
01:03:29,192 --> 01:03:31,358
I can’t even imagine myself
Next to an another man

769
01:03:31,817 --> 01:03:32,442
Come let's run away

770
01:03:34,025 --> 01:03:35,025
You know who my dad is?

771
01:03:37,192 --> 01:03:40,025
My dad didn’t teach me
to run away

772
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:44,692
Whatever comes in life
face it straight and head on

773
01:03:44,733 --> 01:03:44,983
What?

774
01:03:45,442 --> 01:03:47,900
Get ready to engage with
the person chosen by your dad

775
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:50,025
I’ll come there

776
01:03:50,817 --> 01:03:54,150
I’ll put the ring to your finger
in front of everyone

777
01:03:54,858 --> 01:03:57,775
I’ll prove to the world that
our love is immortal

778
01:03:58,358 --> 01:04:01,733
I’ll prove to the world that
we are born to live together

779
01:04:02,233 --> 01:04:02,692
Promise?

780
01:04:05,275 --> 01:04:05,858
I promise you

781
01:04:06,358 --> 01:04:08,733
my word is my life

782
01:04:09,858 --> 01:04:10,358
I love you

783
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:13,692
I will love you forever

784
01:04:16,108 --> 01:04:18,275
My daughter’s favourite place

785
01:04:18,692 --> 01:04:19,942
Partying in a cruise

786
01:04:20,608 --> 01:04:23,067
This arrangement is for her happiness

787
01:04:24,025 --> 01:04:24,858
My dear friends

788
01:04:25,858 --> 01:04:27,858
the richest person in the world

789
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:29,025
Arun Subbaiah

790
01:04:31,483 --> 01:04:32,650
A brave Kuduva

791
01:04:33,108 --> 01:04:36,108
his brother, a doctor
Kiran Subbaiah

792
01:04:36,942 --> 01:04:39,067
A multi millionaire
In Scotland

793
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,400
As a witness after the party

794
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,942
There will be a ring exchange ceremony

795
01:04:47,858 --> 01:04:48,983
Let’s blast the party

796
01:05:35,567 --> 01:05:40,650
Let’s play in high volume and dance

797
01:05:41,858 --> 01:05:43,942
Let’s drink up peg after peg

798
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,608
Let’s play in high volume and dance

799
01:05:48,442 --> 01:05:50,483
Let’s drink up peg after peg

800
01:06:10,942 --> 01:06:13,817
I searched you in sky and earth

801
01:06:14,233 --> 01:06:16,983
I came here O beautiful
in search of you

802
01:06:20,608 --> 01:06:23,317
To win the heart of this beautiful girl

803
01:06:23,942 --> 01:06:26,567
A brave Kodava has come all the way

804
01:06:26,775 --> 01:06:29,942
Keep the beer bottles chilled

805
01:06:29,942 --> 01:06:32,483
Serve it chilled

806
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:36,275
This beauty smiles from
the corner of her eyes

807
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:41,817
Let’s play in high volume and dance

808
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:44,733
Let’s drink up peg after peg

809
01:06:45,775 --> 01:06:48,650
Let’s play in high volume and dance

01:06:49,108 --> 01:06:51,192
Let’s drink up peg after peg

811
01:07:24,608 --> 01:07:27,442
You are the divine beauty
in saree and ornaments

812
01:07:27,858 --> 01:07:30,483
Your beauty is delightful to our hearts

813
01:07:34,233 --> 01:07:36,900
I’ll come to you in warrior attire
with royal dignity

814
01:07:37,608 --> 01:07:40,150
I wish to marry to you

815
01:07:40,317 --> 01:07:43,400
Keep the beer bottles chilled

816
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,358
Serve it chilled

817
01:08:21,817 --> 01:08:26,483
Shall I gift you a present of love?

818
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:31,317
I have written this in blood

819
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:36,483
My heart has sung this

820
01:08:37,275 --> 01:08:41,733
Hundreds of desires
blossomed about you

821
01:08:41,983 --> 01:08:45,817
Shall I gift you a present of love?

822
01:08:47,067 --> 01:08:53,150
I have written this in blood

823
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:19,233
Let’s play in high volume and dance

824
01:09:20,525 --> 01:09:22,400
Let’s drink up peg after peg

825
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:26,192
Let’s play in high volume and dance

826
01:09:26,983 --> 01:09:28,650
Let’s drink up peg after peg

827
01:09:42,192 --> 01:09:45,900
Friends, now is the time
for the ring exchange

828
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,400
Dad, give me one minute
One minute please

829
01:10:10,483 --> 01:10:10,858
Amar

830
01:10:12,025 --> 01:10:13,192
What are you doing here?

831
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:14,358
now it is the time
for the ring exchange

832
01:10:14,567 --> 01:10:15,358
Everyone is waiting

833
01:10:15,733 --> 01:10:17,567
Come let’s go
Come

834
01:10:21,025 --> 01:10:23,858
Bobby, I have forgotten
how to walk

835
01:10:24,233 --> 01:10:25,858
Why are you behaving like a madman?

836
01:10:26,858 --> 01:10:29,067
Not like a madman
This is natural

837
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:32,650
What I feel here
I express it from here

838
01:10:33,275 --> 01:10:34,608
I’m telling you seriously

839
01:10:34,858 --> 01:10:36,733
Get married to the one
chosen by your dad

840
01:10:37,983 --> 01:10:38,608
Yes

841
01:10:39,483 --> 01:10:42,775
Your dad is rich
he is a millionaire!

842
01:10:43,358 --> 01:10:45,983
He is rich too
They both are rich

843
01:10:46,108 --> 01:10:48,650
But I am a zero account case

844
01:10:49,942 --> 01:10:52,150
Listen to me
Get married to him

845
01:10:52,983 --> 01:10:54,942
I did not love you
for the sake of money

846
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,025
All I wanted was love
And I found that in you

847
01:10:59,733 --> 01:11:00,858
I just need you

848
01:11:02,067 --> 01:11:03,942
I don’t give a damn about money

849
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:06,150
Why are you rising that topic now?

850
01:11:06,483 --> 01:11:09,483
Must rise it Bobby

851
01:11:11,775 --> 01:11:14,900
Otherwise, I’ll have to suffer
Lifelong by marrying you

852
01:11:15,483 --> 01:11:17,650
I am already living in
a rented house

853
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:20,192
What should I do now?

854
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:24,192
Your wish.. Your life.. Your way
Why do you ask me?

855
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:27,608
I should ask you only

856
01:11:28,233 --> 01:11:31,608
You are the one who loved me, promised me
and brought me to this situation

857
01:11:33,108 --> 01:11:36,900
Amar, you always pledged your life
For your promises

858
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,775
Why are you stepping back now?

859
01:11:39,192 --> 01:11:42,067
Look, if there is anything else
Lets sort it out later

860
01:11:42,775 --> 01:11:43,858
This is not the right time

861
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:47,775
I don’t know what mistake
I have committed

862
01:11:48,942 --> 01:11:50,442
But don’t give me this punishment

863
01:11:51,108 --> 01:11:52,817
I can't imagine
my life without you

864
01:11:54,275 --> 01:11:57,317
Come let's go
I will fall to your feet

865
01:11:58,067 --> 01:12:00,025
Please
I beg you

866
01:12:03,358 --> 01:12:05,150
I am crying and
you are laughing?!

867
01:12:13,317 --> 01:12:16,317
No way.. No chance

868
01:12:17,275 --> 01:12:19,108
Bobby, I tell you the truth now

869
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:21,608
I don’t like you

870
01:12:23,192 --> 01:12:25,483
In fact, I never liked you

871
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:29,442
It’s all a lie Bobby
It’s all a lie

872
01:12:29,942 --> 01:12:33,733
In fact, I feel disgusting to
See your face

873
01:12:35,358 --> 01:12:38,108
I never liked you Bobby
never liked you

874
01:12:39,775 --> 01:12:40,567
Fuck man!

875
01:12:45,692 --> 01:12:49,108
See, your looks, your dress

876
01:12:49,442 --> 01:12:54,025
Your style, beauty parlour bills
Your costly bike, your attitude

877
01:12:54,025 --> 01:12:56,942
Your talks and way of talk

878
01:12:57,442 --> 01:12:59,400
Make me feel disgusting

879
01:13:02,567 --> 01:13:04,608
You faked cancer

880
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:06,817
You made me wander like a dog

881
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:10,275
But still I fell for you
You know why

882
01:13:10,442 --> 01:13:13,650
If I made you fall in love and
convince your dad for marriage

883
01:13:13,858 --> 01:13:17,192
I’ll become the successor
of your fifty thousand crore wealth

884
01:13:17,442 --> 01:13:21,608
But your dad found another alliance

885
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:28,608
Bobby, after earning, you can say
Money is nothing in front of love

886
01:13:29,567 --> 01:13:32,400
There is no use quoting it before

887
01:13:33,608 --> 01:13:34,025
So

888
01:13:35,192 --> 01:13:37,567
one day, I met your dad

889
01:13:39,108 --> 01:13:42,442
I showed all our photos
which I had in my cell

890
01:13:43,358 --> 01:13:44,942
Poor old man, got frightened

891
01:13:46,067 --> 01:13:47,525
He asked me what’s my demand

892
01:13:48,317 --> 01:13:51,067
I asked for fifty crores
He gave it away

893
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:57,358
I sold your love Bobby

894
01:13:57,817 --> 01:13:59,358
For fifty crores

895
01:14:01,275 --> 01:14:03,233
Fifty crores, I am worth today!

896
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:08,567
Can get hundreds of girls like you
When there is money

897
01:14:09,108 --> 01:14:10,942
Today, I have it

898
01:14:11,775 --> 01:14:14,650
No, I will not believe this

899
01:14:15,067 --> 01:14:17,400
You must believe it Bobby

900
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:18,442
Check out if you want to

901
01:14:19,067 --> 01:14:20,400
the amount transferred by your dad

902
01:14:21,483 --> 01:14:21,942
Okay?

903
01:14:22,817 --> 01:14:26,067
Everybody will be waiting for you
Go now, go..

904
01:14:27,608 --> 01:14:28,067
Hey get lost

905
01:14:31,317 --> 01:14:31,775
Hey get lost

906
01:14:33,483 --> 01:14:36,650
If there is a baddest person on this Earth
It could only be you

907
01:14:37,567 --> 01:14:38,858
Everyone else is good

908
01:14:40,525 --> 01:14:43,108
Okay, I’ll marry him

909
01:14:43,817 --> 01:14:47,858
You should feel jealous
to see me happy with him

910
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:49,192
I'll live like that

911
01:14:50,358 --> 01:14:50,817
Good bye

912
01:15:15,692 --> 01:15:15,858
Yes

913
01:15:19,025 --> 01:15:20,900
Thank you
welcome to my life

914
01:15:34,275 --> 01:15:37,275
As wife to my brother
as my sister

915
01:15:37,775 --> 01:15:39,150
As Goddess of wealth and
prosperity in our home

916
01:15:39,525 --> 01:15:40,567
You will be happy always

917
01:15:48,067 --> 01:15:49,900
Bobby, I tell you the truth now

918
01:15:50,192 --> 01:15:51,900
I don’t like you

919
01:15:58,733 --> 01:16:01,483
Can get hundreds of girls like you
When there is money

920
01:16:09,275 --> 01:16:11,525
My father is a great man

921
01:17:18,971 --> 01:17:24,930
She killed me in one blow

922
01:17:25,888 --> 01:17:30,680
Without showing any mercy

923
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:39,513
Sharp eyes pierce me often

924
01:17:39,805 --> 01:17:45,305
Piercing into my heart
feels soothing

925
01:17:46,513 --> 01:17:49,721
It is my first love

926
01:17:50,055 --> 01:17:53,138
Remembering the first sight

927
01:17:53,471 --> 01:17:58,180
For the first time
madness has stricken me

928
01:18:00,013 --> 01:18:05,721
She killed me in one blow

929
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:11,471
Without showing any mercy

930
01:18:34,888 --> 01:18:37,471
I am the guardian of
your footsteps

931
01:18:38,138 --> 01:18:40,596
I am the servant at
your service

932
01:18:41,721 --> 01:18:45,388
I am the companion in your life

933
01:18:47,888 --> 01:18:50,971
Where ever I am

934
01:18:51,346 --> 01:18:54,471
My complete attention is on you

935
01:18:55,221 --> 01:19:01,596
Holding your fingers gently

936
01:19:01,930 --> 01:19:07,555
I wish to travel the world

937
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:12,305
It is my first love

938
01:19:12,430 --> 01:19:15,680
Remembering the first sight

939
01:19:15,888 --> 01:19:21,555
For the first time
madness has stricken me

940
01:19:50,388 --> 01:19:53,221
Take me in your arms

941
01:19:53,846 --> 01:19:56,846
Let this life end

942
01:19:57,221 --> 01:20:01,096
In your warmth hug

943
01:20:03,221 --> 01:20:09,680
I realised
you are my happiness

944
01:20:10,471 --> 01:20:15,305
I feel like it’s you who is
Kissing every rain drop

945
01:20:15,305 --> 01:20:22,805
and sending them to me

946
01:20:24,263 --> 01:20:27,513
It is my first love

947
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:31,055
Remembering the first sight

948
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:35,763
For the first time
madness has stricken me

949
01:20:50,555 --> 01:20:52,721
Amar, don't keep on trying

950
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:54,763
I'll not answer your call

951
01:20:55,055 --> 01:20:58,305
Will I recieve your call?!
Oh illusion!

952
01:21:11,055 --> 01:21:11,846
Who's that?!

953
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:18,013
Why did you guys come here?

954
01:21:18,138 --> 01:21:22,888
We came here to check whether
your phone is ringing or not

955
01:21:23,346 --> 01:21:25,513
Lost my cell 8 days back
you know!

956
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:28,346
Wait a minute

957
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:33,846
Chikku

958
01:21:35,388 --> 01:21:36,305
Where did you get her video?

959
01:21:38,013 --> 01:21:38,471
Her?

960
01:21:39,846 --> 01:21:41,096
I am not sure, whether
 it is her or not

961
01:21:41,555 --> 01:21:44,096
I been to a school to solve
some software error

962
01:21:44,555 --> 01:21:45,805
I saw a girl over there

963
01:21:46,721 --> 01:21:48,971
I looked at her once, twice

964
01:21:49,888 --> 01:21:52,471
I doubted that
 she looked like Bobby

965
01:21:52,638 --> 01:21:54,680
On safer side, I made a video

966
01:21:55,346 --> 01:21:56,346
I thought of forwarding it to you too

967
01:21:57,971 --> 01:21:59,055
But what is the use of it?

968
01:22:02,055 --> 01:22:03,971
The girl whom you loved
more than your life

969
01:22:04,388 --> 01:22:05,930
promised her that you will marry her

970
01:22:06,138 --> 01:22:11,388
Sold her love for crores
You became a rich, you fraud

971
01:22:14,013 --> 01:22:16,138
You annoyed me that day

972
01:22:16,555 --> 01:22:19,263
So I sent that video to disturb you

973
01:22:19,638 --> 01:22:22,805
But I didn’t know you will get agitated
and come here in search of me

974
01:22:25,305 --> 01:22:28,596
You know what people talk about you

975
01:22:28,805 --> 01:22:29,805
They are calling you a bastard

976
01:22:30,471 --> 01:22:32,763
Hey enough now, just shut up
Sit here

977
01:22:32,971 --> 01:22:34,013
Whats your problem?

978
01:22:34,013 --> 01:22:36,013
What is he asking you?
It is you who made the video, right?

979
01:22:36,138 --> 01:22:37,930
He is asking, where did you film it?
Just give the address

980
01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:38,680
Join us if you want to

981
01:22:39,721 --> 01:22:42,763
Do you want me to join
for his achievements?

982
01:22:42,763 --> 01:22:44,388
Put down the car key now

983
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:47,013
Wash the car tomorrow
No get lost, get out

984
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:52,971
Stop now

985
01:22:57,888 --> 01:23:01,138
Be careful! Its a rented car
I've already broken a mirror

986
01:23:22,805 --> 01:23:24,971
No.. No.. We have no Bobby here

987
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:26,013
Have a look at this photo

988
01:23:29,596 --> 01:23:31,596
That is not Bobby
That is Sister Lisa

989
01:23:33,138 --> 01:23:34,013
She’s working here

990
01:23:35,346 --> 01:23:36,305
Can I..

991
01:23:36,888 --> 01:23:37,388
Can I meet her?

992
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:38,930
No it’s not possible

993
01:23:39,263 --> 01:23:40,680
Our school bus met with an accident

994
01:23:41,221 --> 01:23:43,555
She's gone to serve them in
the hospital at  Interlaken

995
01:23:44,346 --> 01:23:44,763
Okay

996
01:23:46,096 --> 01:23:46,513
Thank you

997
01:24:12,221 --> 01:24:14,013
Hello, your name?
Amar

998
01:24:15,846 --> 01:24:16,805
You are from?
India

999
01:24:18,388 --> 01:24:19,846
And your blood group?
A+

1000
01:24:20,513 --> 01:24:21,013
Thank you

1001
01:24:24,221 --> 01:24:25,305
She is a different person

1002
01:24:28,471 --> 01:24:30,763
For her
Poor you!

1003
01:24:31,555 --> 01:24:33,471
You travelled so far to see her

1004
01:24:34,096 --> 01:24:35,055
Should laugh the hell out

1005
01:24:52,138 --> 01:24:52,971
You look like her

1006
01:24:54,180 --> 01:24:56,555
Same face
Same voice

1007
01:24:58,430 --> 01:25:00,680
But they say she is not her

1008
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:03,596
Bobby

1009
01:25:08,138 --> 01:25:12,138
No way.. She is not Bobby at all

1010
01:25:12,930 --> 01:25:17,180
Even if she was Bobby
What should have been her reaction?

1011
01:25:17,430 --> 01:25:18,555
She should have beaten
him with sandals

1012
01:25:19,055 --> 01:25:22,096
Look, I have read in many books

1013
01:25:22,471 --> 01:25:24,180
I’ve heard from many people

1014
01:25:24,346 --> 01:25:27,055
There are seven other people
in the world who look alike

1015
01:25:27,471 --> 01:25:30,555
Therefore, she is not
Bobby for sure

1016
01:25:30,805 --> 01:25:34,805
She is some Lisa, Bisa
or Mosa. Leave it

1017
01:25:35,346 --> 01:25:37,055
Look, we are in Switzerland

1018
01:25:37,555 --> 01:25:38,971
We have 30 days of Visa

1019
01:25:39,305 --> 01:25:40,513
Let us not waste it

1020
01:25:40,971 --> 01:25:43,596
Let us drink and eat like hell

1021
01:25:43,971 --> 01:25:45,180
There are beautiful girls

1022
01:25:45,471 --> 01:25:46,680
Keeping arms around them

1023
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:49,305
Give me five

1024
01:25:51,263 --> 01:25:52,096
It will be superb

1025
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:09,346
Who do you belong to?

1026
01:26:18,096 --> 01:26:18,930
Hmm excuse me

1027
01:26:20,305 --> 01:26:21,180
Is his anyone’s dog?

1028
01:26:21,596 --> 01:26:22,138
No

1029
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:24,221
Excuse me

1030
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:25,930
That puppy belongs to me

1031
01:26:26,846 --> 01:26:27,096
Can I

1032
01:26:27,846 --> 01:26:28,096
What?

1033
01:26:32,596 --> 01:26:33,263
I mean

1034
01:26:33,721 --> 01:26:35,721
That puppy belongs to me
Can I have it back, please

1035
01:26:53,930 --> 01:26:55,721
You sent a puppy?!

1036
01:26:57,305 --> 01:26:59,430
Your tricks won’t work with her

1037
01:27:00,388 --> 01:27:01,846
She has become a nun

1038
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:03,971
She is not her

1039
01:27:05,305 --> 01:27:07,346
Let's go, it is of no use

1040
01:27:27,971 --> 01:27:30,721
She is like Dimple Kapadia
in Bobby cinema!

1041
01:27:34,555 --> 01:27:37,430
Such a hot girl in this
Switzerland cold!

1042
01:27:38,263 --> 01:27:41,638
I must impress her some how

1043
01:27:59,846 --> 01:28:00,388
Excuse me

1044
01:28:01,221 --> 01:28:01,513
Bobby

1045
01:28:02,763 --> 01:28:03,138
Bobby?!

1046
01:28:03,930 --> 01:28:05,638
I’m observing you
You are following me

1047
01:28:06,721 --> 01:28:08,388
I am sorry, you got
the wrong person

1048
01:28:15,971 --> 01:28:18,221
It is same if you ask us
after the drink

1049
01:28:18,971 --> 01:28:20,888
It is same if you ask us
without making us drink

1050
01:28:21,513 --> 01:28:24,805
She is not the person
That person is not her

1051
01:28:25,305 --> 01:28:27,721
You are a fool
A bloody fool

1052
01:28:28,096 --> 01:28:30,346
An idiot
A bloody idiot. Thats it

1053
01:28:30,513 --> 01:28:31,846
Even I don't want her to be Bobby

1054
01:28:33,763 --> 01:28:36,763
I cant see her in that situation

1055
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:40,221
Let her be Lisa

1056
01:28:43,971 --> 01:28:44,596
From now on

1057
01:28:47,013 --> 01:28:48,221
I’ll do what I have to

1058
01:28:49,596 --> 01:28:50,471
You need not join

1059
01:29:08,888 --> 01:29:13,096
Did you forget my presence?

1060
01:29:17,263 --> 01:29:21,471
After writing a sorrowful poetry

1061
01:29:24,430 --> 01:29:28,263
Tongue got froze

1062
01:29:28,721 --> 01:29:32,221
There is a lack of words

1063
01:29:33,596 --> 01:29:37,013
Feels like I am on
a procession towards death

1064
01:29:39,846 --> 01:29:43,180
Shall I gift you
the present of love?

1065
01:29:44,138 --> 01:29:47,513
Which I wrote it in blood

1066
01:30:01,096 --> 01:30:05,180
Did you forget my presence?

1067
01:30:09,555 --> 01:30:13,763
After writing a sorrowful poetry

1068
01:30:36,721 --> 01:30:44,138
Conversation we had on a silent night
is still lingering

1069
01:30:45,055 --> 01:30:52,180
The footprints on the path
we walked are still imprinted

1070
01:30:52,888 --> 01:30:56,430
Will you not look back a bit?

1071
01:30:57,055 --> 01:30:59,930
Will you not stretch arms again?

1072
01:31:00,555 --> 01:31:04,055
Tongue got frozen

1073
01:31:04,721 --> 01:31:07,763
There is a lack of words

1074
01:31:09,596 --> 01:31:13,346
Feels like I am on
a procession towards death

1075
01:31:15,846 --> 01:31:19,180
Shall I gift you
the present of love?

1076
01:31:20,263 --> 01:31:23,430
Which I wrote it in blood

1077
01:31:37,013 --> 01:31:41,805
Did you forget my presence?

1078
01:31:45,221 --> 01:31:49,430
After writing a sorrowful poetry

1079
01:32:18,805 --> 01:32:26,388
Heavy rain seems like
the sky is crying

1080
01:32:27,305 --> 01:32:30,930
slipping away crores of dreams

1081
01:32:31,763 --> 01:32:34,430
Feels empty handed now

1082
01:32:35,221 --> 01:32:38,888
Spent many lonely days

1083
01:32:39,596 --> 01:32:42,305
being far away from you

1084
01:32:42,846 --> 01:32:46,388
Tongue got frozen

1085
01:32:47,013 --> 01:32:50,430
There is a lack of words

1086
01:32:51,930 --> 01:32:55,930
Feels like I am on
a procession towards death

1087
01:32:58,221 --> 01:33:01,638
Shall I gift you the present of love?

1088
01:33:02,471 --> 01:33:05,846
Which I wrote it in blood

1089
01:33:19,263 --> 01:33:23,513
Did you forget my presence?

1090
01:33:27,471 --> 01:33:31,680
After writing a sorrowful poetry

1091
01:33:43,138 --> 01:33:43,596
Dad

1092
01:33:45,596 --> 01:33:45,971
Dad

1093
01:33:50,638 --> 01:33:51,346
Oh my god!

1094
01:33:53,555 --> 01:33:55,138
My child, you!

1095
01:33:57,513 --> 01:33:58,471
After a long time

1096
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:05,846
Dad, he has come

1097
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:07,138
Who?

1098
01:34:08,138 --> 01:34:08,388
Amar

1099
01:34:13,263 --> 01:34:14,846
I feel disgusting to
mention his name

1100
01:34:15,513 --> 01:34:23,305
The only happiness I had
after coming to this place was

1101
01:34:23,596 --> 01:34:26,513
that I will not see
his face ever again

1102
01:34:27,638 --> 01:34:29,138
But now he has taking it away

1103
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:35,763
Dad, please do something

1104
01:34:37,221 --> 01:34:38,263
He should not follow me

1105
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:45,388
I fell disgusting each and
every moment when I see him

1106
01:34:46,013 --> 01:34:47,638
I feel like dying, dad

1107
01:34:51,721 --> 01:34:55,096
Please dad

1108
01:34:56,805 --> 01:34:57,430
I leave now

1109
01:35:18,763 --> 01:35:19,180
Tell me

1110
01:35:19,346 --> 01:35:21,513
You said, there are 7 people
in the world who look alike

1111
01:35:21,763 --> 01:35:22,180
Yes I did say

1112
01:35:22,513 --> 01:35:24,055
Yes you are right

1113
01:35:24,805 --> 01:35:26,346
But will their father’s too look alike?

1114
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:28,430
What you mean ya?

1115
01:35:29,471 --> 01:35:30,388
Lost his mind due to alcohol

1116
01:35:30,388 --> 01:35:33,263
Will their fathers look alike?
No chance

1117
01:35:34,805 --> 01:35:37,680
I saw her today
with her dad

1118
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:42,013
She is Bobby.. Confirm

1119
01:35:43,180 --> 01:35:45,471
Is it? Is she Bobby?

1120
01:35:45,930 --> 01:35:46,555
Fine then

1121
01:35:46,763 --> 01:35:47,763
My tension got reduced

1122
01:35:48,555 --> 01:35:49,555
What is the next step?

1123
01:38:12,430 --> 01:38:14,471
Don't hit me

1124
01:38:28,684 --> 01:38:31,184
I very well know that she has
informed you that I am here

1125
01:38:32,267 --> 01:38:33,517
I saw you both together too

1126
01:38:35,017 --> 01:38:35,850
I could have spoke then only

1127
01:38:36,475 --> 01:38:38,809
But I kept quiet
To see how you react

1128
01:38:41,059 --> 01:38:44,017
I saw it, you send
rowdies to beat me!?

1129
01:38:47,059 --> 01:38:51,142
I am not the one who is scared
of hired rowdies and bullets

1130
01:38:51,642 --> 01:38:52,934
The daringness is
the blessing of my dad

1131
01:38:53,475 --> 01:38:54,392
Rebel daringness

1132
01:38:56,059 --> 01:38:58,559
I have come here with one motive

1133
01:38:59,642 --> 01:39:02,392
She challenged me that she will live
a happy married life with him

1134
01:39:02,684 --> 01:39:04,892
and make me feel jealous

1135
01:39:06,267 --> 01:39:07,100
What happened to her life Sir?

1136
01:39:08,475 --> 01:39:08,767
And you!

1137
01:39:10,059 --> 01:39:12,225
You rejected me as a poor guy

1138
01:39:13,267 --> 01:39:15,850
What did your richness give
to your daughter?

1139
01:39:17,725 --> 01:39:18,767
What happened to her life?

1140
01:39:22,517 --> 01:39:25,059
We conducted wedding announcement
party in Mangalore

1141
01:39:25,642 --> 01:39:27,475
Organised the marriage in Switzerland

1142
01:39:28,934 --> 01:39:30,850
We shifted to Switzerland

1143
01:39:31,059 --> 01:39:32,892
With the intention of
settling down over there

1144
01:39:34,350 --> 01:39:36,475
There was one month left
for the marriage

1145
01:39:37,767 --> 01:39:42,475
My daughter tried a lot to
get along with that guy

1146
01:39:44,184 --> 01:39:47,100
She got disturbed
every now and then

1147
01:39:52,267 --> 01:39:56,600
One day he took her for
Paragliding

1148
01:40:04,184 --> 01:40:04,809
Fate!

1149
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:07,309
They forgot to hook

1150
01:40:07,892 --> 01:40:09,017
And the worst happened

1151
01:40:12,559 --> 01:40:13,475
No

1152
01:40:16,475 --> 01:40:19,434
He died ten days
before the marriage

1153
01:40:20,809 --> 01:40:23,184
After that she became very quiet

1154
01:40:36,934 --> 01:40:40,434
She started living alone
and in lonliness

1155
01:40:40,892 --> 01:40:44,392
She didn’t speak to anyone
Even at home

1156
01:40:49,850 --> 01:40:52,642
One day it was raining heavily

1157
01:40:54,267 --> 01:40:57,225
I went to her room to talk to her

1158
01:40:57,934 --> 01:40:59,350
She was sitting alone

1159
01:41:01,142 --> 01:41:06,017
My child
It is raining

1160
01:41:07,059 --> 01:41:08,350
Go out
Stand under the rain

1161
01:41:10,309 --> 01:41:11,475
Won’t you talk to your mother?

1162
01:41:17,684 --> 01:41:17,934
No!

1163
01:41:19,642 --> 01:41:21,642
It was a big shock to me

1164
01:41:23,059 --> 01:41:24,184
Later one day

1165
01:41:25,434 --> 01:41:27,100
She called me to talk

1166
01:41:28,642 --> 01:41:32,225
To her favourite place
Interlake view point

1167
01:41:44,517 --> 01:41:44,934
My child

1168
01:41:45,809 --> 01:41:50,975
I couldn’t marry the one I loved

1169
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:54,017
Nor the person you chose for me

1170
01:41:55,309 --> 01:41:56,892
No more marriages in my life dad

1171
01:41:58,267 --> 01:42:02,892
I don’t want the topic of marriage
in my life ever again

1172
01:42:04,309 --> 01:42:05,267
Okay my child

1173
01:42:06,434 --> 01:42:07,100
I am sorry

1174
01:42:13,184 --> 01:42:14,392
World is too wide

1175
01:42:14,975 --> 01:42:18,642
Life your life your way

1176
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:20,767
Live your life

1177
01:42:22,475 --> 01:42:25,309
But, no hasty decisions

1178
01:42:33,767 --> 01:42:34,975
Days passed

1179
01:42:37,017 --> 01:42:37,850
And one fine day

1180
01:42:39,975 --> 01:42:41,684
She said ‘I want to join the hostel’

1181
01:42:42,975 --> 01:42:47,475
I said yes so that she will mingle
with others and forget things

1182
01:42:50,934 --> 01:42:52,184
She stopped coming home

1183
01:42:52,850 --> 01:42:54,100
Whenever she wanted to see me

1184
01:42:55,142 --> 01:42:58,934
She used to ask me to meet at her
favourite place Interlake view point

1185
01:43:01,059 --> 01:43:01,934
I used to go

1186
01:43:03,975 --> 01:43:05,184
And whenever I felt like seeing her

1187
01:43:06,350 --> 01:43:07,517
Near Grindlewald valley

1188
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:11,725
She would stand alone
at sunset view point

1189
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:14,934
Just not to disturb her

1190
01:43:16,850 --> 01:43:18,434
I would pass by in car
and look at her

1191
01:43:19,850 --> 01:43:21,059
And consoled myself

1192
01:43:31,934 --> 01:43:34,142
She spent most of her time
in the church

1193
01:43:41,642 --> 01:43:47,059
One day, she said she wanted to meet me
And called me to the church

1194
01:43:58,100 --> 01:43:58,975
Excuse me

1195
01:44:15,434 --> 01:44:16,017
My child

1196
01:44:17,309 --> 01:44:18,684
I am sorry for everything dad

1197
01:44:37,434 --> 01:44:38,975
In this beautiful world

1198
01:44:40,350 --> 01:44:41,850
When everybody are happy

1199
01:44:43,350 --> 01:44:45,767
My daughter became silent

1200
01:44:47,475 --> 01:44:52,225
That day, my happiness
completely vanished

1201
01:44:53,850 --> 01:44:57,434
The light which I see
far away is you Amar

1202
01:44:59,434 --> 01:45:02,767
I am happy that I got
someone to talk to

1203
01:45:04,975 --> 01:45:05,934
Forget the past

1204
01:45:07,559 --> 01:45:12,309
Please try if you can
make her fall in love again

1205
01:45:30,767 --> 01:45:31,767
Hi
Hi

1206
01:45:32,267 --> 01:45:33,559
Give this to that lady over there

1207
01:45:34,059 --> 01:45:34,475
Alright

1208
01:45:36,225 --> 01:45:36,809
This is for you

1209
01:45:37,642 --> 01:45:38,434
Where did you get it?

1210
01:45:38,850 --> 01:45:39,725
That guy over there

1211
01:45:44,142 --> 01:45:47,184
Bobby, I love you

1212
01:45:48,184 --> 01:45:48,934
I love you

1213
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:52,142
I love you forever

1214
01:45:58,350 --> 01:45:59,725
Why are you behind sister Lisa?

1215
01:46:00,517 --> 01:46:01,850
I am not after Sister Lisa

1216
01:46:02,892 --> 01:46:05,142
I am here for Bobby

1217
01:46:05,850 --> 01:46:06,850
You can check her passport

1218
01:46:07,517 --> 01:46:08,642
Can I see your passport?

1219
01:46:11,850 --> 01:46:13,684
What is he upto with my life?

1220
01:46:14,517 --> 01:46:16,684
Jesus, please save me form him

1221
01:46:23,809 --> 01:46:24,684
Bobby from India!?

1222
01:46:35,850 --> 01:46:36,850
I should not have given it

1223
01:47:09,350 --> 01:47:10,017
Ya may be

1224
01:47:10,850 --> 01:47:11,975
Where is your passport?

1225
01:47:12,225 --> 01:47:14,434
My passport is with Amar

1226
01:47:15,059 --> 01:47:15,642
Who is Amar?

1227
01:47:16,225 --> 01:47:16,809
Who is Amar!

1228
01:47:19,225 --> 01:47:20,600
Hey, who invented bulb?

1229
01:47:21,225 --> 01:47:22,184
Thomas Alva Edison

1230
01:47:23,225 --> 01:47:25,517
Lady, who invented phone?

1231
01:47:26,017 --> 01:47:26,517
Graham Bell

1232
01:47:26,975 --> 01:47:29,225
Hey, white cockroach
who invented Television?

1233
01:47:29,809 --> 01:47:30,767
Taylor Farnsworth

1234
01:47:30,934 --> 01:47:31,975
Very good, very good! smart

1235
01:47:32,392 --> 01:47:33,767
Who invented walky talky?

1236
01:47:34,184 --> 01:47:34,767
Alfred

1237
01:47:35,517 --> 01:47:38,142
Good, who invented Switzerland?

1238
01:47:39,017 --> 01:47:40,475
Maria
No!

1239
01:47:41,850 --> 01:47:42,767
Mr Amar!

1240
01:47:43,475 --> 01:47:46,309
Switzerland is invented by Amar

1241
01:47:46,684 --> 01:47:48,059
He is the one who brought me here

1242
01:47:48,059 --> 01:47:49,559
All my documents are with him

1243
01:47:49,767 --> 01:47:50,809
Collect it, that’s it

1244
01:47:51,725 --> 01:47:52,434
Oh! Will he come here?

1245
01:47:53,350 --> 01:47:56,934
Hey, he is the one who
discovered Switzerland

1246
01:47:57,267 --> 01:47:59,184
He will come
Yes!

1247
01:48:07,350 --> 01:48:07,809
Amar

1248
01:48:08,975 --> 01:48:10,434
I have not commited anything wrong

1249
01:48:10,684 --> 01:48:12,684
Please save me from these people

1250
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:14,017
Matter is

1251
01:48:14,892 --> 01:48:15,934
On one fine evening!

1252
01:48:16,642 --> 01:48:21,809
I saw a beautiful girl while walking in
shivering cold of Switzerland

1253
01:48:25,434 --> 01:48:26,475
I looked at her

1254
01:48:28,267 --> 01:48:28,892
I smiled at her

1255
01:48:29,225 --> 01:48:31,767
She, smiled like this

1256
01:48:33,642 --> 01:48:35,392
I made a decision as she was beautiful

1257
01:48:35,684 --> 01:48:38,559
And I went to her the next day

1258
01:48:50,934 --> 01:48:52,392
I told her to spread her legs

1259
01:48:55,475 --> 01:48:56,725
She has mistaken that

1260
01:48:57,100 --> 01:49:00,309
All I said was, why are you
sitting quietly in a swimming dress!

1261
01:49:00,809 --> 01:49:03,975
I told her to dive into the pool and swim

1262
01:49:04,309 --> 01:49:05,642
after some days

1263
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:13,059
I styled like Super star Sudeep
And stood in front of her

1264
01:49:16,934 --> 01:49:18,267
I said illusion?!

1265
01:49:19,059 --> 01:49:22,725
She has mistaken that
And brought me here

1266
01:49:22,892 --> 01:49:25,850
Please make her understand I love her

1267
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:29,059
Please convince her for me

1268
01:49:31,267 --> 01:49:32,225
Actually you have mistaken him

1269
01:49:33,684 --> 01:49:34,475
He actually loves you

1270
01:49:37,225 --> 01:49:38,017
I love you too

1271
01:49:52,309 --> 01:49:52,934
Mister Amar

1272
01:49:53,392 --> 01:49:54,975
You are going back to
your country alone

1273
01:49:55,225 --> 01:49:55,767
I am not coming

1274
01:49:56,309 --> 01:49:56,850
The reason is

1275
01:49:57,017 --> 01:50:03,100
I’ve decided to get married
to a beautiful and settle down here

1276
01:50:04,475 --> 01:50:06,225
I am in love
Yes

1277
01:50:06,475 --> 01:50:09,142
So, I am a Green card holder here

1278
01:50:09,725 --> 01:50:15,267
You alone weep and go by flight

1279
01:50:15,684 --> 01:50:18,434
After I become a father
I’ll mail you

1280
01:50:18,892 --> 01:50:20,809
Courier me a good gift

1281
01:50:21,309 --> 01:50:23,309
See ya, bye
Get lost

1282
01:51:03,059 --> 01:51:03,267
Bobby

1283
01:51:08,809 --> 01:51:10,559
Bobby, stop

1284
01:51:11,517 --> 01:51:12,184
I need to talk to you

1285
01:51:13,100 --> 01:51:13,309
Bobby

1286
01:51:14,184 --> 01:51:14,642
Bobby stop

1287
01:51:18,434 --> 01:51:19,684
I need to tell you a..

1288
01:51:19,684 --> 01:51:22,392
Why are you behind me?

1289
01:51:22,642 --> 01:51:23,975
You killed Bobby on that day itself

1290
01:51:26,934 --> 01:51:28,850
I cant see you in this situation

1291
01:51:29,517 --> 01:51:31,350
I had only one happiness

1292
01:51:31,725 --> 01:51:33,517
that I will not see
your face ever gain

1293
01:51:33,809 --> 01:51:36,225
By coming here, why are you
taking away that happiness from me?

1294
01:51:37,350 --> 01:51:38,309
Please give me a chance

1295
01:51:39,725 --> 01:51:40,934
Please don’t ever follow me

1296
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:44,017
Please don’t take away my happiness

1297
01:51:48,184 --> 01:51:48,475
Bobby

1298
01:51:49,684 --> 01:51:52,975
I didn’t know, my one single mistake
will bring you to this sitaution

1299
01:51:53,725 --> 01:51:57,309
Not just six lives
I wait hundred lives for you

1300
01:51:57,975 --> 01:51:59,142
I still love you

1301
01:52:10,434 --> 01:52:13,600
He destroyed my life completely

1302
01:52:15,142 --> 01:52:16,350
Save me from him

1303
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:30,892
What happened?

1304
01:52:31,309 --> 01:52:32,517
By marrying her

1305
01:52:33,434 --> 01:52:38,142
I had planned to settle in Switzerland

1306
01:52:39,475 --> 01:52:40,684
Oh my fate!

1307
01:52:41,434 --> 01:52:42,434
You know what happened?

1308
01:52:43,517 --> 01:52:46,100
My lover, holding my right hand

1309
01:52:46,725 --> 01:52:48,142
Sitting on my lap

1310
01:52:48,684 --> 01:52:50,975
whatever promises she made

1311
01:52:51,517 --> 01:52:54,934
She was doing the same with
someone else on her lap

1312
01:52:55,309 --> 01:52:57,100
Seeing that my heart broke into pieces

1313
01:52:57,350 --> 01:52:59,892
I will not live, I will die

1314
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:03,392
Please take me back to our Country

1315
01:53:04,642 --> 01:53:05,309
No chance

1316
01:53:06,642 --> 01:53:07,517
Hey, don't do that

1317
01:53:08,475 --> 01:53:10,559
You are my God
I fall to your feet

1318
01:53:12,642 --> 01:53:15,267
My eyes got blur for a moment

1319
01:53:16,684 --> 01:53:18,434
Hey, what is this Can’t you wear shorts and sleep?

1320
01:53:19,350 --> 01:53:21,184
Wait, I will pour drops to my eyes

1321
01:53:30,517 --> 01:53:31,434
Good evening everbody

1322
01:53:32,267 --> 01:53:33,767
Ttoday I like to speak a few words

1323
01:53:34,517 --> 01:53:35,434
about inspiration

1324
01:53:36,642 --> 01:53:38,350
My inspiration was a special person

1325
01:53:39,892 --> 01:53:40,642
Named Bobby

1326
01:53:41,684 --> 01:53:43,100
she inspired me to do many things

1327
01:53:44,392 --> 01:53:46,392
Bobby is the love of my life

1328
01:53:47,517 --> 01:53:48,350
She was my heart

1329
01:53:49,142 --> 01:53:52,350
Today, in her name, in her honour

1330
01:53:52,684 --> 01:53:55,642
I am going to make a donation of
one million franks to your school

1331
01:53:57,725 --> 01:54:01,892
And I would like to present that cheque
to your very own sister Lisa

1332
01:54:05,350 --> 01:54:06,142
With your permission mother

1333
01:54:06,850 --> 01:54:08,309

Thank you Sir

1336
01:54:22,017 --> 01:54:23,850
Excuse me
Just a minuite

1337
01:54:26,225 --> 01:54:27,392
Bobby Bobby Bobby!

1338
01:54:28,267 --> 01:54:30,642
You have no rights to take that name

1339
01:54:32,642 --> 01:54:37,100
You made me fall in love
Who never beilieved in love before

1340
01:54:37,350 --> 01:54:38,267
Falling in love with you

1341
01:54:38,434 --> 01:54:39,934
I dreamt of so many things

1342
01:54:40,350 --> 01:54:42,559
When I was happy
thinking that I’ll live like this forever

1343
01:54:43,309 --> 01:54:45,434
You promised me
you cheated me

1344
01:54:45,892 --> 01:54:47,100
And said my love was a crap

1345
01:54:48,559 --> 01:54:49,684
You said you sold it for money

1346
01:54:50,017 --> 01:54:52,434
You said “I will get hundreds of girls
like you if I have money”

1347
01:54:52,642 --> 01:54:54,517
You have money now
Go

1348
01:54:55,517 --> 01:54:58,559
Why are you torturing me like this?

1349
01:54:59,809 --> 01:55:00,392
In this 5 years

1350
01:55:00,809 --> 01:55:05,517
You know how much I suffered each and
every moment to find this happiness?!

1351
01:55:09,934 --> 01:55:12,475
Why are you taking away
my happiness now?

1352
01:55:13,809 --> 01:55:15,184
For the betrayal you committed

1353
01:55:15,434 --> 01:55:17,600
not only me
even God will not forgive you

1354
01:55:20,975 --> 01:55:23,767
Please If you want to do
something good to me

1355
01:55:24,309 --> 01:55:26,225
Don’t ever show your face to me

1356
01:55:27,559 --> 01:55:28,225
Get lost!

1357
01:55:47,053 --> 01:55:47,469
My child

1358
01:55:49,219 --> 01:55:51,553
What you did is wrong
He is not that

1359
01:55:52,511 --> 01:55:54,053
Actually what happened was different

1360
01:55:56,636 --> 01:56:01,261
That day, it was his father’s
11th day ceremony

1361
01:56:10,053 --> 01:56:15,303
I curse God for the punishment
he delivered to you at this young age

1362
01:56:16,636 --> 01:56:19,511
Again I’ll pray to him
To give you all strength

1363
01:56:24,219 --> 01:56:27,511
I need to talk to your son
for a minute

1364
01:56:41,136 --> 01:56:43,094
Amar I am sorry for the great loss

1365
01:56:45,886 --> 01:56:47,636
Probably my daughter
has told you everything

1366
01:56:50,178 --> 01:56:52,261
She was still young
She was five years

1367
01:56:53,178 --> 01:56:54,011
She lost her mother

1368
01:56:55,511 --> 01:56:58,469
She’s my only daughter and my life

1369
01:56:59,261 --> 01:56:59,969
She is everything to me

1370
01:57:01,636 --> 01:57:05,636
I sacrificed all my happiness
to keep her happy

1371
01:57:06,511 --> 01:57:08,928
How my daughter should live

1372
01:57:09,344 --> 01:57:14,136
I designed with whom she should marry
where she should live

1373
01:57:16,428 --> 01:57:20,511
My daughter never spoke
about any man to me

1374
01:57:21,094 --> 01:57:24,053
But one day
She spoke about you

1375
01:57:25,261 --> 01:57:26,969
And asked money for you

1376
01:57:27,886 --> 01:57:28,178
I gave

1377
01:57:29,678 --> 01:57:33,469
Since that day my person
started following you

1378
01:57:34,844 --> 01:57:39,136
I came to know that you both are
in deep love with each other

1379
01:57:40,178 --> 01:57:40,844
Yes Sir

1380
01:57:42,219 --> 01:57:44,428
I love her more than my life

1381
01:57:44,428 --> 01:57:46,136
This is what

1382
01:57:46,636 --> 01:57:48,053
Was not in my design

1383
01:57:48,511 --> 01:57:49,969
Which hurt me a lot

1384
01:57:50,719 --> 01:57:52,428
If you leave her for me

1385
01:57:53,136 --> 01:57:54,844
All my dreams will come true

1386
01:57:56,511 --> 01:57:58,178
If you want to marry only her

1387
01:58:00,136 --> 01:58:01,344
I don’t have any problem

1388
01:58:02,511 --> 01:58:07,011
11th day ceremony which is
happening in your house

1389
01:58:08,261 --> 01:58:12,136
Same will happen in my day after 11 days

1390
01:58:14,011 --> 01:58:15,344
This is my final decision

1391
01:58:17,678 --> 01:58:18,886
She doesn't have her mother

1392
01:58:20,344 --> 01:58:21,261
And if you are not there!

1393
01:58:22,761 --> 01:58:24,011
Don't say like that Sir

1394
01:58:25,719 --> 01:58:26,969
If I marry Bobby

1395
01:58:28,136 --> 01:58:29,136
She will have husband

1396
01:58:30,553 --> 01:58:32,094
But if she marry the one you like

1397
01:58:33,386 --> 01:58:35,928
She will have husband and also father

1398
01:58:37,053 --> 01:58:40,053
I came to know the value of
my father after losing him

1399
01:58:41,094 --> 01:58:41,844
I promise you

1400
01:58:43,511 --> 01:58:45,969
You and your daughter
should always be happy

1401
01:58:47,553 --> 01:58:48,053
Thank you

1402
01:58:49,178 --> 01:58:52,011
You will forget her
but she wont

1403
01:58:53,678 --> 01:58:55,136
If she has to go away from you

1404
01:58:56,219 --> 01:58:59,094
You have to break the promise
you made to her

1405
01:59:06,053 --> 01:59:09,428
I am ready sacrifice for you

1406
01:59:22,386 --> 01:59:23,303
He is a good person

1407
01:59:24,344 --> 01:59:27,511
Like people say
he is not living on my money

1408
01:59:28,094 --> 01:59:29,261
I have not given money to him

1409
01:59:29,761 --> 01:59:31,553
He  is earning his bread

1410
01:59:33,178 --> 01:59:35,886
He is living with your memories

1411
01:59:36,803 --> 01:59:41,386
He came here in search of you
When he came to know about you

1412
01:59:44,178 --> 01:59:49,219
Dad, I didn’t know it was you
Who ruined my life

1413
01:59:49,928 --> 01:59:51,094
I trusted him a lot

1414
01:59:51,886 --> 01:59:56,469
I loved him more than you

1415
01:59:58,136 --> 02:00:00,636
Is this the design which
 you made for me dad?

1416
02:00:03,428 --> 02:00:04,344
 He cheated me

1417
02:00:05,636 --> 02:00:06,594
You cheated me

1418
02:00:07,886 --> 02:00:09,261
Even God cheated me

1419
02:00:11,469 --> 02:00:14,303
I lived for all these days
that dying is a crime

1420
02:00:14,553 --> 02:00:15,261
For you

1421
02:00:16,511 --> 02:00:17,886
Now there is nothing left to live

1422
02:00:19,636 --> 02:00:24,511
Dad I am going far away from you

1423
02:00:25,678 --> 02:00:26,969
So please don’t stop me

1424
02:00:56,469 --> 02:00:58,803
we all mistook you

1425
02:00:59,886 --> 02:01:04,469
You listened to our scolding

1426
02:01:06,136 --> 02:01:10,719
How did you bare it?
Please forgive me Amar

1427
02:01:44,053 --> 02:01:51,094
No more tears left

1428
02:01:52,553 --> 02:02:00,136
Life is filled with sorrow

1429
02:02:01,303 --> 02:02:09,344
The path has come to an end

1430
02:02:10,178 --> 02:02:20,511
The only thing left to be one is to
Stop my breath

1431
02:02:21,803 --> 02:02:29,678
No more tears left

1432
02:02:30,594 --> 02:02:38,469
Life is filled with sorrow

1433
02:02:43,803 --> 02:02:57,553
If the sky poisons the rain
To whom the Earth will complain?

1434
02:02:58,969 --> 02:03:17,386
Need to erase everything in the past once
Why there is no such option in life?

1435
02:03:47,178 --> 02:03:52,011
I am very sorry. I couldn’t make her
 fall in love again. I leave now

1436
02:03:54,094 --> 02:04:01,136
She sanctioned death sentence

1437
02:04:06,553 --> 02:04:14,511
Without listening to my last wish

1438
02:04:15,969 --> 02:04:26,844
There is no bruises nor shock
But still a deep pain

1439
02:04:28,386 --> 02:04:40,386
Probably this is called death in love

1440
02:04:42,553 --> 02:05:07,553
No more tears left
Life is filled with sorrow

1441
02:05:09,303 --> 02:05:09,969
Destiny

1442
02:05:12,053 --> 02:05:15,261
What can be done?!
It is all in the hands of providence

1443
02:05:47,928 --> 02:05:51,678
I love you
I will be with you even in your death

1444
02:07:49,053 --> 02:07:53,178
Name Amar has its own weightage

1445
02:07:54,094 --> 02:07:55,511
It should never lose

1446
02:07:56,303 --> 02:08:00,469
Even in love, challenges and life

1447
02:08:02,969 --> 02:08:04,636
I’ll never let you fail

1448
02:08:05,844 --> 02:08:10,303
I’ll be in your life as your
strength and your brother

1449
02:08:23,928 --> 02:08:24,803
I don’t know what to do?

1450
02:08:26,803 --> 02:08:27,928
Sister love is God

1451
02:08:29,428 --> 02:08:33,178
Trust this God. You still can
go back to your colorful life

1452
02:08:36,511 --> 02:08:38,511
Your love has won

1453
02:08:38,969 --> 02:08:39,511
Thank you Sir

1454
02:08:41,636 --> 02:08:42,094
I love you

1455
02:08:43,928 --> 02:08:44,636
I will love you forever

1456
02:08:45,053 --> 02:08:46,553
Yes done
all the best

1457
02:09:06,844 --> 02:09:07,928
Amar will you promise me one thing?

1458
02:09:08,553 --> 02:09:10,511
No way, no chance

1459
02:09:41,761 --> 02:09:47,511
This is the gift of love
gifted by my beloved friend

1460
02:09:48,094 --> 02:09:49,928
In his long career life

1461
02:09:50,386 --> 02:09:58,553
the moment he faced the camera
for the last time in front of me is for you
