1
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,931
Father, in the beginning, I didn't know
whether or not I was committing a sin.

2
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,306
But I'm carrying a sin now.

3
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:26,806
The punishment is now
chasing me relentlessly.

4
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,723
I've paid the price for it, too.

5
00:02:29,973 --> 00:02:31,140
And yet...

6
00:02:31,515 --> 00:02:35,140
I'm unable to unburden myself
of the sin.

7
00:02:36,015 --> 00:02:38,157
You must give me a solution.

8
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:39,140
Please.

9
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:44,390
Sins and sinners...
it's not up to men to decide.

10
00:02:44,806 --> 00:02:46,848
Jesus Christ shall decide.

11
00:02:47,056 --> 00:02:49,890
He will also be merciful.

12
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,931
Don't be afraid,
and confess your sin to me.

13
00:03:16,681 --> 00:03:18,515
Thanks a lot, Father.

14
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:20,390
I'm feeling relieved now.

15
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:27,640
For giving me this confession on behalf
of Jesus, may I hold your hand and pray?

16
00:03:31,223 --> 00:03:32,473
Father...

17
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,681
Father?

18
00:03:36,473 --> 00:03:37,681
Father!

19
00:06:48,723 --> 00:06:49,765
Mother-in-law...

20
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,032
Mother-in-law, come here.

21
00:06:52,056 --> 00:06:54,241
What is it, Abhi? I'm busy.
Come here!

22
00:06:54,265 --> 00:06:55,556
Come.

23
00:06:55,973 --> 00:06:58,015
Dad, it's our wedding anniversary.

24
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,866
Danam did mention.
I forgot about it.

25
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,074
Happy anniversary.

26
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:03,389
Bless us, mother-in-law.

27
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,931
How many years now?
Five or six?

28
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:08,390
You forget everything.
It's the 6th year.

29
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,782
Be happy always.

30
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,305
Bless you.
Won't you bless them with a smile?

31
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:15,223
It's enough if they're happy?

32
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,973
What about others?
What's the point in blessing anyway?

33
00:07:20,515 --> 00:07:22,015
You know what your mother is like.

34
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,473
Forget it. Let's eat.

35
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,515
I've been blessing for a long time now.

36
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:45,515
From the Kapaleeswar temple in our town
to Kasi, I've prayed to all gods.

37
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:49,390
At least from next year,
try to get blessings with a third person.

38
00:07:49,848 --> 00:07:51,556
I'm the third person.
Here I come.

39
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:52,991
What now?

40
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,616
You're always joking.

41
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,574
By the way, many more happy returns
of the day.

42
00:07:57,598 --> 00:07:58,973
Thank you.
Congrats.

43
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:00,074
Thanks, Vetri.

44
00:08:00,098 --> 00:08:03,866
So, where's my treat?
Moonrakers or Barbecue Nation?

45
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,598
For now, idlies, pongal and idiyappam.
Okay?

46
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:08,056
That's boring, sister-in-law.

47
00:08:08,473 --> 00:08:10,032
You'll eat instant noodles then?

48
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,449
Oh, I'd rather have idiyappam.

49
00:08:12,473 --> 00:08:14,598
I'll eat this.
What's for side dish?

50
00:08:15,223 --> 00:08:17,931
Got an appointment with the doctor?

51
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:19,223
No, dad.

52
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,305
They only had an appointment
for next week.

53
00:08:21,306 --> 00:08:24,199
Abhi, bring more idlies from the stove.
Okay, mother-in-law.

54
00:08:24,223 --> 00:08:29,640
Father Joseph from St. Thomas Church has
been killed under mysterious circumstances.

55
00:08:30,306 --> 00:08:33,140
You'll find an excuse
to let the bad guys free anyway.

56
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:38,931
It's real nice to sit at home, read your
papers, watch the news and talk Law and Order.

57
00:08:39,515 --> 00:08:41,657
We'd like to shoot the men
we catch, too.

58
00:08:41,681 --> 00:08:43,723
But we have a million questions to answer.

59
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:47,015
Then find a case where you can shoot
them down, no questions asked.

60
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,657
You're on his side, huh?

61
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:50,449
Sister-in-law, tell me...

62
00:08:50,473 --> 00:08:52,181
Should I take up this case or not?

63
00:08:52,306 --> 00:08:55,306
So now dad plays the lawyer's role
and sis-in-law is the commissioner?

64
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,241
Real nice.
Look.

65
00:08:57,265 --> 00:08:59,366
First, let your sister-in-law
play a mother's role.

66
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,306
That'll do.

67
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:02,598
I long for a grandchild,
but that's not happening.

68
00:09:04,181 --> 00:09:05,765
But they get angry if I say something.

69
00:09:13,806 --> 00:09:14,848
Why, mom?

70
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,223
You've started?

71
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,472
Can't you keep quiet?

72
00:09:19,473 --> 00:09:21,056
I'm saying it like it is.

73
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:22,366
I'm not the only one.

74
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,199
Yesterday, our neighbour Bhagyam came home
to invite for her daughter's baby shower.

75
00:09:25,223 --> 00:09:26,556
I said we'll be there.

76
00:09:26,681 --> 00:09:28,657
She said only I'm to come.

77
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:29,890
What about that?

78
00:09:30,056 --> 00:09:32,765
Let them talk.
Why do you also talk that way?

79
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,473
First, look at her as a woman.

80
00:09:35,681 --> 00:09:37,348
Then you won't notice these flaws.

81
00:09:38,265 --> 00:09:40,973
You've eaten enough idlies.
Go console her.

82
00:09:53,473 --> 00:09:54,390
Morning, sir.

83
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,157
Morning, sir.

84
00:09:56,181 --> 00:09:58,282
Good morning, Vetrimaaran.
Sit down.

85
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,140
Thank you, sir.

86
00:10:02,473 --> 00:10:04,973
Sir, I was asked to meet you
right away. Please tell me.

87
00:10:05,265 --> 00:10:09,723
A complaint has been filed
personally by a V.I.P. this morning.

88
00:10:17,056 --> 00:10:19,056
The CEO of Ski TV,
Mr. Guhan?

89
00:10:19,556 --> 00:10:22,306
Yes, he's filed a complaint that his
wife has been missing for two days.

90
00:10:22,515 --> 00:10:25,074
Do they suspect abduction?

91
00:10:25,098 --> 00:10:26,866
He's not able to explain properly.

92
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,074
But one more thing...

93
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:33,265
if other news channels find out, they're
worried the issue will get blown out.

94
00:10:35,223 --> 00:10:38,306
I called you so that
it could be dealt with confidentially.

95
00:10:38,723 --> 00:10:42,056
You may interrogate Mr. Guhan
for further details.

96
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,265
His number is right there.
Okay, sir.

97
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,223
Yes, sir.

98
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:09,515
So, the drivers and maids in your house...

99
00:11:09,765 --> 00:11:13,074
when did they last see her?

100
00:11:13,098 --> 00:11:14,390
Wednesday evening.

101
00:11:14,723 --> 00:11:19,181
At the end of his duty,
the driver asked when to come the next day.

102
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,097
She had asked him to come
at the usual time.

103
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,223
No one has seen her since.

104
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:25,907
Where were you at the time?

105
00:11:25,931 --> 00:11:29,616
I'd gone to Hyderabad for a meeting
with Telugu language channels.

106
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,389
When did you last call her?

107
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,181
The next morning.

108
00:11:34,056 --> 00:11:35,598
Her phone was switched off.

109
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:38,532
But her phone is almost always
switched off.

110
00:11:38,556 --> 00:11:40,723
So I wasn't too worried.

111
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:42,241
When did you begin to suspect?

112
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:44,306
Not until that night.

113
00:11:44,556 --> 00:11:48,556
I didn't want to create a big issue,
so I waited.

114
00:11:48,806 --> 00:11:52,931
Then I went and placed a complaint
with the commissioner.

115
00:11:56,556 --> 00:11:57,515
Thank you, sir.

116
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,015
How long have you been married?

117
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,366
Four years.

118
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,032
Kids?

119
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:04,015
We had put it on hold.

120
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,907
We are in plans now.

121
00:12:05,931 --> 00:12:09,366
What are your wife's hobbies
and personal activities?

122
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,265
She's one cricket fanatic.

123
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:15,532
She'd even go to the church and pray
for the Indian team to win.

124
00:12:15,556 --> 00:12:16,848
She's that obsessed.

125
00:12:17,223 --> 00:12:19,449
Your wife is a believer?

126
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:22,890
Yes. She goes to the church
every Sunday without fail.

127
00:12:23,598 --> 00:12:24,657
And sometimes...

128
00:12:24,681 --> 00:12:28,306
She takes all important decisions
after consulting with the Father.

129
00:12:28,765 --> 00:12:29,782
Which church?

130
00:12:29,806 --> 00:12:31,681
St. Thomas Church, Villivakam.

131
00:12:33,973 --> 00:12:37,282
Are you aware of the Father's death?

132
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:37,991
Yes.

133
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,681
I just got to know
through my news division.

134
00:12:42,515 --> 00:12:45,032
Thank you for your co-operation.
We'll be in touch with you shortly.

135
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:45,973
Thank you.

136
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:51,306
How can you be so sure, Vetri?

137
00:12:51,515 --> 00:12:54,449
Jessica was last seen in her house
on Wednesday.

138
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:57,574
The murder of Father Joseph
took place on Thursday.

139
00:12:57,598 --> 00:13:00,723
He died at the confession box.

140
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,264
He must have listened
to someone's confession that morning.

141
00:13:03,265 --> 00:13:05,640
My angle is,
what if that was Jessica?

142
00:13:06,473 --> 00:13:07,324
Good morning, sir.

143
00:13:07,348 --> 00:13:09,056
Come in, Stephen.
Have a seat.

144
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:11,473
Vetri.
Yes, sir.

145
00:13:11,598 --> 00:13:14,366
He is the officer
dealing with the case of Father's death.

146
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,473
Hello, sir.
Hello.

147
00:13:15,723 --> 00:13:19,032
Vetri thinks a missing person's case
that he's handling...

148
00:13:19,056 --> 00:13:24,973
a girl may have gone to confess at the time,
and have something to do with the death.

149
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,907
Maybe so.

150
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:31,491
But then we'll have to suspect everyone
right from the watchman to the bell-ringer.

151
00:13:31,515 --> 00:13:32,265
It's simple.

152
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,824
Although his services to the church were
clean, upon digging up, we discovered...

153
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,931
he's undergone one by-pass heart surgery
and needed another procedure.

154
00:13:39,306 --> 00:13:43,515
The stress around his medical expenses
have led him to take this decision.

155
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,390
All the signs point to suicide.

156
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:48,265
What's your opinion on the case?

157
00:13:48,473 --> 00:13:52,056
I doubt if the Father's case is
truly a suicide.

158
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,782
How do you say that?

159
00:13:53,806 --> 00:13:58,515
He may have had stress in his personal
life, but he's a true christian.

160
00:13:58,848 --> 00:14:03,056
A true christian wouldn't spill his blood
in the Holy Church.

161
00:14:04,848 --> 00:14:08,657
He could have killed himself
at home. Why didn't he?

162
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,681
You're more familiar with The Bible
than the Father?

163
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,515
Not necessary.
I understand Christianity.

164
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,765
To close this case, we need to
investigate this along with Jessica's.

165
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,473
He seems to be a prophet.

166
00:14:25,806 --> 00:14:27,389
Let him handle this case, too.

167
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,140
Yes, Stephen.
That is my decision.

168
00:14:30,306 --> 00:14:31,723
Let Vetri handle it.

169
00:14:31,848 --> 00:14:33,556
Sir!
What?

170
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,848
Hand over all relevant case files to him.

171
00:14:38,848 --> 00:14:39,616
Yes, sir.

172
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
Vetri.
Sir?

173
00:14:40,806 --> 00:14:45,907
There's one station S.I. Thirupathi
who was earlier on the case...

174
00:14:45,931 --> 00:14:47,390
he will help you out.

175
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,765
But he's a chatter-box.
Mind him.

176
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,848
I'll handle it, sir.
Thank you.

177
00:14:57,806 --> 00:15:05,098
Ask, and it shall be given; Seek, and ye shall
find; Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.

178
00:15:05,473 --> 00:15:07,973
You're almost the same height and weight
as the Father.

179
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:12,640
So I'm just trying to gauge
with you as a reference.

180
00:15:13,098 --> 00:15:13,806
Step out.

181
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:21,681
Am I some guinea pig for an experiment?

182
00:15:21,848 --> 00:15:23,116
You can see everything...

183
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,265
Where the Father would have sat, stood,
died and where he must be now.

184
00:15:27,765 --> 00:15:29,265
Just one difference.

185
00:15:29,473 --> 00:15:32,015
Father is not alive now.
But I am.

186
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,598
The commissioner was right about you.

187
00:15:36,473 --> 00:15:37,848
What did he say?

188
00:15:39,765 --> 00:15:40,681
Everything.

189
00:15:42,056 --> 00:15:45,098
Maybe about Constable Banumathi?
No one knows about her.

190
00:15:45,306 --> 00:15:46,765
Or maybe I'm getting a promotion?

191
00:15:46,973 --> 00:15:48,265
That's impossible.

192
00:16:58,473 --> 00:17:01,348
He rings the bell.
His name is Anthony.

193
00:17:01,473 --> 00:17:03,390
Hello, sir.
He's been working here for eight years now.

194
00:17:03,598 --> 00:17:05,473
It was the Father who got him this job.

195
00:17:06,348 --> 00:17:08,616
At what time did the Father
normally come to church?

196
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,699
Normally, 7:00 am.
On Sundays, at 5.

197
00:17:11,723 --> 00:17:14,265
He also comes at 5
if there is a special mass or prayer.

198
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,098
He died in the church at 6 A.M.

199
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:20,348
Was there a special prayer then?

200
00:17:20,848 --> 00:17:21,890
No.

201
00:17:22,348 --> 00:17:24,032
Why did he come early then?

202
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:29,449
Some V.I.Ps known to him,
call ahead before coming for a confession.

203
00:17:29,473 --> 00:17:30,824
Did someone come that day?

204
00:17:30,848 --> 00:17:33,223
My child was sick.
I wasn't here.

205
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:36,473
But he asked me not to close the gate
before leaving.

206
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:42,848
Did you tell him or the earlier policemen
about leaving the gate open?

207
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:44,473
No, sir. They didn't ask.

208
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,056
You'll only tell us if we ask?

209
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:49,390
I am exit!

210
00:17:51,931 --> 00:17:55,806
Who discovered his body?

211
00:17:56,181 --> 00:17:57,973
A girl called Thendral.

212
00:17:58,265 --> 00:17:59,640
Where does she work?

213
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,389
Thendral, two police officers
are here to see you.

214
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,931
They're waiting at the corridor.

215
00:18:24,848 --> 00:18:26,098
Tell them I'll be there.

216
00:18:36,473 --> 00:18:39,015
Even donkeys look cute and cuddly
when they're kids.

217
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,324
Give it 5 - 6 years...

218
00:18:40,348 --> 00:18:43,306
they'll cause problems between the parents
and chase them both away.

219
00:18:44,265 --> 00:18:45,390
Went overboard, did I?

220
00:18:53,806 --> 00:18:55,848
Here she comes.
Thendral.

221
00:18:56,723 --> 00:18:57,930
Her name means "breeze".

222
00:18:57,931 --> 00:18:59,723
She's a tsunami, really.

223
00:19:02,265 --> 00:19:03,556
Why did you want to see me?

224
00:19:04,265 --> 00:19:05,431
Are you Thendral?

225
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,699
Yes, I am.
What do you want?

226
00:19:08,723 --> 00:19:10,556
I'm Assistant Commissioner Vetrimaran.

227
00:19:11,598 --> 00:19:12,806
Show me your ID.

228
00:19:13,098 --> 00:19:15,782
But the elections just got over.
Is this for local elections?

229
00:19:15,806 --> 00:19:17,473
She wants to see your voters' ID, sir.

230
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:21,265
Not your voters' ID.
Proof that you really are a cop.

231
00:19:21,431 --> 00:19:23,806
Why do you want to see it?

232
00:19:24,015 --> 00:19:25,140
Why can't I ask to see it?

233
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:27,723
He looks like a school kid
who has lost his homework!

234
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:30,806
What is it?

235
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:34,723
You discovered the Father's body.

236
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:36,782
I need to speak to you
regarding that.

237
00:19:36,806 --> 00:19:40,473
I've told you so many times.
You even came two days ago.

238
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,473
Did I?

239
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,140
Your department.

240
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,723
He was there, too.

241
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,556
They interrogated me for two hours.

242
00:19:47,806 --> 00:19:49,765
Our neighbours asked so many questions.

243
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:53,390
Now you've come to my workplace!
What do you want from me?

244
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,890
Everyone told me not to
get involved with the police.

245
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,931
I didn't listen.

246
00:20:00,223 --> 00:20:02,265
I should have walked out
when I saw the dead body.

247
00:20:02,473 --> 00:20:05,348
A sniffing dog would have
landed at your house then.

248
00:20:05,473 --> 00:20:06,991
You're threatening me?

249
00:20:07,015 --> 00:20:09,181
I'm just responding.

250
00:20:09,431 --> 00:20:10,282
Look-

251
00:20:10,306 --> 00:20:14,407
you people come again and again
and ask the same questions.

252
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:15,866
"Why did you go to church?"

253
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,348
"Why did you go in the morning?"

254
00:20:17,473 --> 00:20:18,991
"When did you see Father's dead body?"

255
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:20,782
"Was he alive when you saw him?"

256
00:20:20,806 --> 00:20:21,723
Is that it?

257
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,473
Leave now. Please.

258
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:27,056
I've not come here to inquire
about seeing the Father's body.

259
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:28,765
Then?

260
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,098
If it was a murder, maybe you witnessed it?

261
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:37,806
Next time, try to tell me
the whole truth.

262
00:20:37,973 --> 00:20:40,973
Next time?
He takes his time investigating.

263
00:20:58,973 --> 00:21:01,390
Sir... Yeah? That's
Thendral's house.

264
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,324
Go on.

265
00:21:03,348 --> 00:21:05,056
I must see that old man again?

266
00:21:12,556 --> 00:21:14,015
Nobody home?

267
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:15,866
Here he comes.

268
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,390
Is Thendral here?

269
00:21:17,806 --> 00:21:19,390
She left to work.

270
00:21:21,223 --> 00:21:23,931
You've already inquired.

271
00:21:24,265 --> 00:21:25,473
Why have you...?

272
00:21:25,973 --> 00:21:29,223
It's the new A.C.
He wants to re-inquire.

273
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,407
Let her know we came by.

274
00:21:31,431 --> 00:21:32,265
Okay, sir.

275
00:21:33,223 --> 00:21:35,032
I'm sure the A.C heard the old man.

276
00:21:35,056 --> 00:21:37,473
But I'll do my duty anyway.
Wretched job!

277
00:21:37,681 --> 00:21:39,931
Sir, she's left to work.

278
00:21:40,056 --> 00:21:41,473
What now?
Back to the school?

279
00:21:41,765 --> 00:21:44,306
Not necessary.
She'll come to the station.

280
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,157
Don't take this lightly as it's just a
missing person's case.

281
00:22:02,181 --> 00:22:03,741
Update me by morning.
Okay, sir.

282
00:22:03,765 --> 00:22:05,640
A girl called Thendral
is here to meet you.

283
00:22:06,306 --> 00:22:07,241
Sit.

284
00:22:07,265 --> 00:22:10,806
I told you not to come to my work place.
And you came to my house?

285
00:22:12,265 --> 00:22:14,390
Is it okay for a girl
to come to the police station?

286
00:22:14,931 --> 00:22:16,223
If you're okay with it...

287
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,848
we'll call you here
whenever we have questions.

288
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:22,890
What's your question now?
Tell me.

289
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:28,390
Is this your chain?

290
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,056
I'm not a christian.

291
00:22:32,265 --> 00:22:33,681
Alex!
Sir?

292
00:22:35,473 --> 00:22:37,390
Yes, sir.
When is your pilgrimage?

293
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,348
Next week, sir.
I wanted to apply for leave...

294
00:22:41,931 --> 00:22:43,640
We'll talk later.

295
00:22:43,765 --> 00:22:44,681
Thank you, sir.

296
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,765
I go to the church every week.
Does that make me a christian?

297
00:22:49,223 --> 00:22:50,556
It makes no difference.

298
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:55,015
Jesus, Gandhi, Che Guevara...
have all become fashion symbols these days.

299
00:22:55,306 --> 00:22:57,973
First of all, that's not my chain.

300
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,306
Besides, I go to the church every month
to collect the funds from the Trust.

301
00:23:02,431 --> 00:23:07,306
I called the Father the previous evening...
Oh, she's started again!

302
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,265
But when I went inside,
the Father wasn't there.

303
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:14,181
When I went to the confession hall,
he was lying there dead.

304
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,640
I don't even remember
how I got out.

305
00:23:16,806 --> 00:23:19,199
I remember taking my scooter out.

306
00:23:19,223 --> 00:23:21,556
You had your scooter?

307
00:23:22,056 --> 00:23:26,223
While entering, was the main gate
half open or fully open?

308
00:23:29,556 --> 00:23:31,032
It was fully open.

309
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:34,015
Did you park your scooter
to the left or right?

310
00:23:37,473 --> 00:23:38,741
On the right side.

311
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:41,199
Did you use the side stand
or the center stand?

312
00:23:41,223 --> 00:23:43,098
Why?
Just answer me.

313
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,098
Side stand.

314
00:23:46,265 --> 00:23:47,556
Did you lock it?

315
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:48,806
Yes.

316
00:23:48,973 --> 00:23:51,848
You must have looked in the mirror
at least once?

317
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:53,556
Nothing nice to look at.

318
00:23:57,723 --> 00:24:01,181
Did you see anything or anyone
moving in the surroundings?

319
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:02,473
No.

320
00:24:02,598 --> 00:24:04,556
Any cars or bikes?

321
00:24:05,265 --> 00:24:05,991
No.

322
00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:08,848
You must have seen something.
Think hard.

323
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:13,390
The time of Father's death
and your arrival are more or less the same.

324
00:24:18,098 --> 00:24:20,765
I think I saw a car.

325
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,473
But she didn't tell me!

326
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,598
Not that I asked.

327
00:24:25,348 --> 00:24:26,640
Was it this car?

328
00:24:29,973 --> 00:24:31,640
Yes, looks like it.

329
00:24:31,765 --> 00:24:33,473
Was anyone there inside the car?

330
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,640
No.
Really?

331
00:24:35,973 --> 00:24:37,407
I said, no.

332
00:24:37,431 --> 00:24:38,431
Okay, cool.

333
00:24:38,681 --> 00:24:39,532
Then?

334
00:24:39,556 --> 00:24:41,074
Then I went into the church.

335
00:24:41,098 --> 00:24:42,449
There are three entrances.

336
00:24:42,473 --> 00:24:45,157
Did you take the main entrance
or the side entrance?

337
00:24:45,181 --> 00:24:48,532
The main entrance was closed.
So I took the side entrance.

338
00:24:48,556 --> 00:24:50,949
Which entrance did you exit from?

339
00:24:50,973 --> 00:24:54,473
I said, I left in a hurry
and I don't remember.

340
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,181
Did you miss something?

341
00:24:56,598 --> 00:24:58,449
No.
Think about it.

342
00:24:58,473 --> 00:24:59,390
No.

343
00:25:01,598 --> 00:25:05,223
He's gifting her
during an on-going interrogation?

344
00:25:05,473 --> 00:25:06,723
Is this yours?

345
00:25:10,431 --> 00:25:13,681
I missed my keychain
while taking out my scooter.

346
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:18,098
Then you must have been scared
while turning on the scooter?

347
00:25:18,598 --> 00:25:19,931
Was the car still there?

348
00:25:26,848 --> 00:25:28,222
It wasn't there then.

349
00:25:28,223 --> 00:25:29,223
That's it.

350
00:25:29,556 --> 00:25:31,348
Jessica came to church.

351
00:25:32,806 --> 00:25:34,306
There was a struggle.

352
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,806
She could not have left alone.

353
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,223
Are you done?
May I leave?

354
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,890
Anyway...

355
00:25:43,015 --> 00:25:45,140
Thanks a lot, Miss Thendral.
Don't mention it.

356
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:47,574
You're doing a good job investigating.

357
00:25:47,598 --> 00:25:50,116
Thank you.
You're doing a good job covering up.

358
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,640
You won't call me again?

359
00:25:51,765 --> 00:25:52,890
Hard to say.

360
00:25:53,348 --> 00:25:55,848
You have not told me
the whole truth. So I might call again.

361
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:57,640
Why?
For witnessing a murder?

362
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:58,973
No.

363
00:25:59,223 --> 00:26:01,098
Maybe you committed the murder.

364
00:26:01,473 --> 00:26:03,848
I don't have to come back
when you call me.

365
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,015
Too much.
This is it.

366
00:26:17,223 --> 00:26:18,556
Thirupathi...
Sir?

367
00:26:18,765 --> 00:26:20,015
What do you think?

368
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,890
She's a nice girl.

369
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:23,930
I meant, the case.

370
00:26:23,931 --> 00:26:26,723
Yes, I don't think she's our case.
She's a nice girl.

371
00:26:28,931 --> 00:26:30,390
Do something.
Yes, sir?

372
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:32,265
Take two days off.

373
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,390
The A.C is all heated up now.
It's about to burst...

374
00:26:35,931 --> 00:26:37,806
I'll handle the case
from my home, sir.

375
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,473
I am exit.

376
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,556
Yes, she has conceived!

377
00:27:17,015 --> 00:27:18,765
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you so much.

378
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,598
Two months and ten days.

379
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:24,348
I don't know what to say.
I'm so happy.

380
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,765
God had just delayed the happiness.

381
00:27:29,056 --> 00:27:32,640
How should I care for my wife now?

382
00:27:32,806 --> 00:27:36,140
Our mothers know best.
I have nothing to add.

383
00:27:36,265 --> 00:27:38,723
As a doctor, I won't say anything.

384
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:40,890
You won't take me seriously anyway.

385
00:27:41,265 --> 00:27:44,806
First, go home and celebrate.
Okay?

386
00:27:45,015 --> 00:27:47,723
Our parents will be even happier than us.

387
00:27:47,848 --> 00:27:49,848
Call them up, then.

388
00:27:49,973 --> 00:27:50,890
Sure, Doctor.

389
00:27:53,098 --> 00:27:54,657
Vetri, come in!

390
00:27:54,681 --> 00:27:57,616
Your brother just called.
Your sister-in-law has conceived!

391
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,015
I'm going to become a grandmother.
Here, have these sweets.

392
00:28:00,473 --> 00:28:01,782
You're going to become an uncle.

393
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:05,056
I'm so excited!

394
00:28:05,348 --> 00:28:06,598
Come on in.

395
00:28:17,306 --> 00:28:18,265
It's Vetri.

396
00:28:18,806 --> 00:28:19,574
Vetri?

397
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:21,431
Keeping a secret from a cop, eh?

398
00:28:21,556 --> 00:28:23,973
Everyone at home is ecstatic!

399
00:28:24,806 --> 00:28:27,806
After all these years,
a child will call you 'mom' and 'dad'.

400
00:28:27,931 --> 00:28:28,907
I'll be an uncle.

401
00:28:28,931 --> 00:28:30,532
But that's not my source of happiness.

402
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:33,782
I'm happy when you and brother
are happy.

403
00:28:33,806 --> 00:28:34,890
Give it to me.

404
00:28:35,473 --> 00:28:37,824
Delivering some dialogues to your
sister-in-law?

405
00:28:37,848 --> 00:28:40,598
As if you weren't delivering dialogues
all these years?

406
00:28:40,723 --> 00:28:43,431
Oh, I should never have spoken to you.

407
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:45,890
Anyway, where's my treat?

408
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,556
My hearty wishes to both of you.

409
00:28:48,723 --> 00:28:50,556
Thanks. Bye.
Bye.

410
00:29:01,765 --> 00:29:03,640
You've shifted your house, huh?

411
00:29:14,765 --> 00:29:16,032
What do you want?

412
00:29:16,056 --> 00:29:17,473
I need to meet you
about the case.

413
00:29:18,098 --> 00:29:19,265
I can't see you now.

414
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,890
I'm seeing you right now.

415
00:29:21,015 --> 00:29:22,157
Stop bluffing.

416
00:29:22,181 --> 00:29:25,265
Are you standing outside my house again?
I'm not even there...

417
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,015
And you claim you're looking at me?

418
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:30,140
Can't see you outside that house.

419
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:33,598
But at Ashok Nagar,
Majestic Flats No-15...

420
00:29:33,723 --> 00:29:36,723
you've been spotted at
the 2nd floor balcony.

421
00:29:41,473 --> 00:29:42,306
Hi.

422
00:29:43,223 --> 00:29:47,390
I won't have to call to check your
whereabouts now.

423
00:29:47,806 --> 00:29:50,056
Why would you want to do that?
For the case.

424
00:29:51,265 --> 00:29:53,265
Why, for committing murder?
No.

425
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,723
For plotting a murder.

426
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:59,949
You're a police officer.
Is it nice to flirt?

427
00:29:59,973 --> 00:30:00,973
Flirt?

428
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,680
When I wake up in the morning
and drink a hot cup of coffee...

429
00:30:03,681 --> 00:30:05,473
and the feeling of relaxation
I get after a workout?

430
00:30:05,598 --> 00:30:07,556
That's what I feel
when I talk to you.

431
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:10,074
You'll never solve this case.

432
00:30:10,098 --> 00:30:11,991
You won't find even a tiny clue.

433
00:30:12,015 --> 00:30:13,431
This is my curse to you.

434
00:30:16,765 --> 00:30:18,140
Not a tiny clue.

435
00:30:18,973 --> 00:30:20,723
Let me find a big one.

436
00:31:58,765 --> 00:32:02,199
Is it true that the deceased is
Jessica from Ski TV?

437
00:32:02,223 --> 00:32:04,015
Not now, sorry.

438
00:32:07,681 --> 00:32:09,473
Have you confirmed that it's Jessica?

439
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,931
They've confirmed only with
the external marks now.

440
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,223
Is the post-mortem taking place here?

441
00:32:15,473 --> 00:32:17,890
Yes, sir.
The body has decomposed badly...

442
00:32:18,015 --> 00:32:20,806
so the commissioner ordered the post-mortem
at scene of crime.

443
00:32:38,348 --> 00:32:39,390
Thirupathi...
Sir?

444
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,223
Collect all the things
in the car without fail.

445
00:32:43,056 --> 00:32:44,282
Informed the husband?

446
00:32:44,306 --> 00:32:45,616
I just did...

447
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,056
but the other channels got here
even before.

448
00:32:48,306 --> 00:32:49,723
Where is the post-mortem taking place?

449
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:55,806
Sir...

450
00:32:55,931 --> 00:32:57,931
It's unlikely that she was chopped.

451
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:00,157
It must have decayed already...

452
00:33:00,181 --> 00:33:02,723
and vultures or dogs
must have ripped it apart.

453
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,157
Sir, another ten minutes.

454
00:33:04,181 --> 00:33:07,764
The internals will be complete.
I'll give you a complete report.

455
00:33:07,765 --> 00:33:09,015
Okay, I'll be around.

456
00:33:13,431 --> 00:33:16,223
I thought we'd find a clue
about the Father once we find Jessica.

457
00:33:17,265 --> 00:33:18,473
Now she's gone.

458
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:22,098
The Father who absolved her sins
is not alive.

459
00:33:22,681 --> 00:33:25,140
The confessor Jessica is not alive, either.

460
00:33:25,556 --> 00:33:26,890
What was the sin?

461
00:33:28,348 --> 00:33:31,098
Something that was known
only to the Father and Jesus...

462
00:33:32,306 --> 00:33:33,806
was known to someone else.

463
00:33:33,973 --> 00:33:34,931
Excuse me, sir.

464
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:38,806
Cause of death is a physical wound...
A slit on the right wrist.

465
00:33:39,056 --> 00:33:41,556
She's died due to bleeding.

466
00:33:42,348 --> 00:33:44,015
One more important thing, sir.

467
00:33:44,973 --> 00:33:46,098
She was pregnant.

468
00:34:05,931 --> 00:34:07,431
Look at the time!

469
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,348
The minister is on call.

470
00:34:11,556 --> 00:34:12,390
Leader?

471
00:34:13,015 --> 00:34:15,806
Not at all.
Take your time, leader.

472
00:34:15,931 --> 00:34:19,157
We need you and madam
to shower your blessings.

473
00:34:19,181 --> 00:34:19,949
Okay, leader.

474
00:34:19,973 --> 00:34:22,223
When is the leader coming?
It's getting late.

475
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:24,890
Another ten minutes.
Get to work.

476
00:34:25,098 --> 00:34:26,015
Hurry up!

477
00:34:39,223 --> 00:34:42,098
You should be happy now.
Why do you look so glum?

478
00:34:42,431 --> 00:34:43,556
I can't, mother.

479
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:44,848
Can't what?

480
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:47,681
Isn't this wrong?

481
00:34:47,931 --> 00:34:49,449
You didn't do it deliberately.

482
00:34:49,473 --> 00:34:51,015
Stop looking so sad.

483
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:53,390
Put on a smile.

484
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:00,556
Mother...

485
00:35:01,473 --> 00:35:03,098
I need to use the restroom.

486
00:35:03,931 --> 00:35:05,991
Go freshen up.
And make it quick.

487
00:35:06,015 --> 00:35:07,723
The minister is almost here.

488
00:35:27,348 --> 00:35:30,014
Are you happy now?
Thanks for your wishes!

489
00:35:30,015 --> 00:35:32,640
You wanted a grandson so badly.

490
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:36,848
Now you've got a male heir
to your political life!

491
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,223
Yes, leader?

492
00:35:43,515 --> 00:35:45,532
Is the function over?
Or just about to begin?

493
00:35:45,556 --> 00:35:48,223
It's just beginning, leader.
Where is the girl?

494
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:50,890
Dad?

495
00:35:51,098 --> 00:35:52,890
Where is Vidya?

496
00:35:53,015 --> 00:35:54,782
She went to the bathroom.
Go check on her.

497
00:35:54,806 --> 00:35:55,515
Okay, dad.

498
00:35:57,473 --> 00:35:58,556
Just a minute.

499
00:36:04,223 --> 00:36:05,407
Vidya!
What's happened?

500
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:07,723
She refuses to open up.
We've been knocking.

501
00:36:07,848 --> 00:36:08,782
Vidya!

502
00:36:08,806 --> 00:36:10,699
Vidya! Open up.

503
00:36:10,723 --> 00:36:12,782
Open the door.

504
00:36:12,806 --> 00:36:14,265
Vidya!

505
00:36:58,890 --> 00:36:59,848
Brother...

506
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,223
She's here.

507
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,556
She's on her scooter.

508
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,765
She's about to start the scooter.

509
00:37:28,515 --> 00:37:30,598
Watch where you're going!

510
00:37:37,348 --> 00:37:38,098
Let me go.

511
00:37:42,181 --> 00:37:43,640
Help!

512
00:39:03,681 --> 00:39:05,431
Let's get out of here.

513
00:39:06,556 --> 00:39:08,431
Start the car.
Let's go, brother.

514
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,181
Come on!

515
00:39:20,181 --> 00:39:20,931
Hello.

516
00:39:22,098 --> 00:39:23,181
Black colour Scorpio car.

517
00:39:23,723 --> 00:39:25,890
TN 09 F 8479

518
00:39:26,306 --> 00:39:28,515
I want all the details of the vehicle.
Quick.

519
00:39:38,806 --> 00:39:40,265
Thanks.
For what?

520
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:42,181
For lifting up your scooter?

521
00:39:42,598 --> 00:39:44,015
Or saving your chain?

522
00:39:44,223 --> 00:39:45,765
Didn't look like they wanted my chain.

523
00:39:46,265 --> 00:39:48,431
It looked like an attempt to murder.
Could be.

524
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:52,556
If the people who killed the Father
had seen you...

525
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,782
they might try to kill you.

526
00:39:54,806 --> 00:39:56,223
Will you please stop this?

527
00:39:57,223 --> 00:40:00,973
Fine, let's say I saw something.
Then what?

528
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:06,765
Trouble began only when you started
following me around for inquiry.

529
00:40:07,015 --> 00:40:08,366
Please try to understand.

530
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:10,473
Stop following me around.
Please.

531
00:40:10,681 --> 00:40:14,431
Till you tell me the whole truth,
I will follow you.

532
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,657
That's my duty.

533
00:40:15,681 --> 00:40:17,556
You only think about your duty.

534
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:19,806
But I have my responsibilities.

535
00:40:20,098 --> 00:40:21,890
I have to take care of my parents.

536
00:40:22,515 --> 00:40:25,241
I need to be alive for their sake.

537
00:40:25,265 --> 00:40:27,015
Don't take my life into any risk.

538
00:40:41,598 --> 00:40:43,449
Hello.
Jagan from Control Room, sir.

539
00:40:43,473 --> 00:40:47,014
I checked the details. No vehicle has
been registered under that number.

540
00:40:47,015 --> 00:40:48,390
Okay, thank you.

541
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:10,223
Should have killed her in the church that
day and tossed her in the garbage, too.

542
00:41:10,556 --> 00:41:11,991
Did she see you that day?

543
00:41:12,015 --> 00:41:13,390
Shut up.

544
00:41:13,848 --> 00:41:15,514
Why else would she go to the police?

545
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:17,598
We saw her.
She must have seen us, too.

546
00:41:17,806 --> 00:41:19,265
That's why I sent you.

547
00:41:19,848 --> 00:41:21,015
Let it go this time.

548
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:23,015
I won't miss next time.

549
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,848
Yes, John?
It was a miss today.

550
00:41:29,848 --> 00:41:31,324
They screwed up.

551
00:41:31,348 --> 00:41:32,931
They won't miss next time.

552
00:41:33,265 --> 00:41:34,890
Okay, will do.

553
00:41:35,723 --> 00:41:36,806
When are you coming?

554
00:41:37,223 --> 00:41:38,140
Okay.

555
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,681
What's her name?

556
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,765
Thendral.
Yes, Thendral.

557
00:41:45,973 --> 00:41:47,431
Put that on hold.

558
00:41:47,556 --> 00:41:48,640
Why?

559
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,765
Give it a week.
I'll let you know.

560
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:55,140
Find her house address, meanwhile.
Okay?

561
00:41:56,098 --> 00:41:57,223
Okay.

562
00:42:18,806 --> 00:42:20,015
Why have you come now?

563
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,991
To let everyone know
this address, too?

564
00:42:22,015 --> 00:42:24,890
Look, you're mistaken about me.

565
00:42:25,348 --> 00:42:27,222
Let's not talk now.
Go away.

566
00:42:27,223 --> 00:42:28,265
What is it?

567
00:42:28,598 --> 00:42:30,848
Dad, he's come to meet you.

568
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:32,515
Come in, sir.

569
00:42:40,765 --> 00:42:41,515
Sir...

570
00:42:42,015 --> 00:42:45,848
I didn't invite you only out of respect
for your profession...

571
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,848
but also due to
fear of being spotted by people.

572
00:42:49,765 --> 00:42:52,473
My daughter has told you
everything she knows.

573
00:42:52,806 --> 00:42:54,098
What more do you want?

574
00:42:55,515 --> 00:42:59,348
Not just her, the whole family
has been inconvenienced.

575
00:42:59,473 --> 00:43:02,015
We even shifted our house for this.

576
00:43:02,181 --> 00:43:04,640
You've come here, too.
Where will we go?

577
00:43:04,973 --> 00:43:07,973
Tell me. How can my daughter be with you
till you close the case?

578
00:43:09,181 --> 00:43:11,640
I've not raised a boy.
She's a girl!

579
00:43:12,015 --> 00:43:15,015
She's 24 now.
We're looking for a groom.

580
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:18,305
If the police constantly come and go,
who will marry my daughter?

581
00:43:18,306 --> 00:43:19,390
I'll marry her.

582
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,598
You want to know who will
marry your daughter.

583
00:43:25,015 --> 00:43:26,098
I will.

584
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,348
I'm not saying this because
I happened to meet her.

585
00:43:34,973 --> 00:43:36,723
I happen to like her job.

586
00:43:38,848 --> 00:43:41,223
With her educational qualification,
she can make a lot of money.

587
00:43:41,515 --> 00:43:43,181
And yet, she chose a job
she's passionate about.

588
00:43:43,723 --> 00:43:46,431
The job at the play school,
I like that, too.

589
00:43:47,015 --> 00:43:48,681
Discuss this with your daughter.

590
00:43:50,723 --> 00:43:51,782
Besides...

591
00:43:51,806 --> 00:43:55,598
you shifted your house for superstitious
reasons. Don't blame it on us.

592
00:44:21,306 --> 00:44:22,890
I need to talk to you.

593
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,098
Not over the phone.

594
00:44:26,556 --> 00:44:27,515
In person.

595
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:29,140
Where?

596
00:44:33,265 --> 00:44:34,973
I understand you wanted to
meet alone.

597
00:44:35,515 --> 00:44:36,890
But why here?

598
00:44:37,306 --> 00:44:41,098
I only told you part of the truth
about what I saw.

599
00:44:42,223 --> 00:44:43,390
I hid the rest.

600
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,181
It wasn't just Jessica's car that I saw.

601
00:44:49,723 --> 00:44:52,157
I also saw another car
and four men.

602
00:44:52,181 --> 00:44:55,223
I don't know them, but they looked
like the bad sort of people.

603
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:58,223
If I see them again,
I can surely identify them.

604
00:45:02,015 --> 00:45:03,806
Why are you telling me this now?

605
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:07,348
I don't have to speak the truth
to a police officer.

606
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,556
But to someone I like,
I can't lie.

607
00:45:49,765 --> 00:45:51,765
Sir, your wife is calling.

608
00:45:52,098 --> 00:45:53,181
Wife?

609
00:46:43,973 --> 00:46:45,848
A chill selfie on a sunny day?

610
00:47:35,598 --> 00:47:37,765
Very cute!
Unfortunately, she doesn't have parents.

611
00:47:38,473 --> 00:47:41,473
Many such children from the orphanage
are students here.

612
00:47:41,765 --> 00:47:43,015
You're truly gifted, Thendral.

613
00:47:43,723 --> 00:47:46,449
You're around so many children
even before marriage.

614
00:47:46,473 --> 00:47:48,806
Put your kids here, too!

615
00:47:49,723 --> 00:47:51,431
You've chosen a great girl.

616
00:48:43,306 --> 00:48:44,889
As long as you like it.

617
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:49,890
I like your family so much,
I posted the group selfie on Facebook.

618
00:48:50,015 --> 00:48:52,491
With the caption
"Having a lovely moment with my family."

619
00:48:52,515 --> 00:48:55,473
You don't have the copyrights yet!
How could you do that?

620
00:48:57,015 --> 00:49:00,973
I had the rights to go into your kitchen
and make coffee for everyone...

621
00:49:01,306 --> 00:49:03,265
I don't need copyrights anymore.

622
00:49:03,973 --> 00:49:04,681
Hello.

623
00:49:05,306 --> 00:49:05,931
Hello.

624
00:49:06,848 --> 00:49:07,598
Hello.

625
00:49:12,848 --> 00:49:13,556
Sister-in-law?

626
00:49:18,098 --> 00:49:19,015
Sister-in-law!

627
00:49:20,931 --> 00:49:22,348
Give me your phone.

628
00:49:23,015 --> 00:49:24,348
What happened to your phone?

629
00:49:24,723 --> 00:49:26,806
It ran out of charge.
I need to make a call.

630
00:49:33,431 --> 00:49:35,140
Why do you look so low?

631
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:39,181
You've been like this
for a week now.

632
00:49:39,598 --> 00:49:40,473
Why?

633
00:49:41,723 --> 00:49:43,598
No such thing, Vetri.

634
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:47,806
Okay, I'll stay out of it.

635
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:49,265
Sorry.

636
00:49:49,765 --> 00:49:50,681
Vetri...

637
00:49:53,806 --> 00:49:55,015
It's just...

638
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,598
More than feel upset about
not having a child...

639
00:49:58,931 --> 00:50:01,140
I've suffered in this house.

640
00:50:01,806 --> 00:50:03,765
Mother-in-law and her friends...

641
00:50:04,931 --> 00:50:08,640
You know how they used to talk.

642
00:50:09,931 --> 00:50:11,556
But now everything has changed.

643
00:50:12,306 --> 00:50:14,681
Your mother and brother
take extremely good care of me.

644
00:50:14,806 --> 00:50:17,140
Yes, everyone is happy.

645
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:19,306
This is nothing to feel sad about.

646
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:20,890
In case...

647
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,015
there's no baby,
what would happen to me?

648
00:50:25,515 --> 00:50:28,640
I doubt if I'd always be
with your brother.

649
00:50:29,306 --> 00:50:32,181
So I'm even more nervous
about the birth of the child.

650
00:50:33,765 --> 00:50:35,265
You feel this way now.

651
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:39,140
But later, with medicines, education,
and other things to worry about...

652
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:41,098
you'll wish you hadn't had a baby.

653
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:42,681
Don't talk like that.

654
00:50:42,848 --> 00:50:44,681
Then?
Why do you worry about these things?

655
00:50:44,931 --> 00:50:48,556
First, decide a name
and which school to put the child in.

656
00:50:48,723 --> 00:50:50,973
Forget about this.
Here, take this.

657
00:50:53,015 --> 00:50:54,265
Now, cheese!

658
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:01,098
That's good.

659
00:51:15,931 --> 00:51:18,848
These are the things we collected
from Jessica's car.

660
00:51:19,765 --> 00:51:23,681
We cross-verified.
All of these are her belongings.

661
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:28,848
No matter how many times we dig up,
it's the same books, soaps and combs.

662
00:51:29,098 --> 00:51:30,348
It won't change.

663
00:51:30,931 --> 00:51:34,931
The question paper is the same,
but two students get different grades.

664
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,157
Why, Thirupathi?

665
00:51:36,181 --> 00:51:39,116
One is a smart student,
and the other is dull.

666
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:40,598
Why do you ask?

667
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,931
You'll see.
Okay.

668
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,782
Check if there's a CCTV camera
in this petrol bunk.

669
00:51:57,806 --> 00:51:58,723
Okay, sir.

670
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:02,431
We have so much evidence.
Why are you only looking into the bill?

671
00:52:03,098 --> 00:52:04,265
Look at the date.

672
00:52:04,556 --> 00:52:06,097
A day after she went missing...

673
00:52:06,098 --> 00:52:09,473
On the day of her murder,
she has filled petrol.

674
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:11,640
Get it?

675
00:52:12,056 --> 00:52:13,782
I get it.

676
00:52:13,806 --> 00:52:18,181
You're an A.C by education.
I'm an S.I through experience.

677
00:52:18,515 --> 00:52:19,390
Sir!

678
00:52:20,223 --> 00:52:22,056
I need to ask you something.
What?

679
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:25,931
Like the movie dialogue, "Of all the
girls, why did I fall of Jessie?"

680
00:52:26,056 --> 00:52:30,015
Why do you give so much importance
to Jessica's case?

681
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:32,598
You really want to know.

682
00:52:32,723 --> 00:52:33,931
Ball is in your court, sir.

683
00:52:36,473 --> 00:52:39,640
Five years back,
when I was an inspector at R-6 station...

684
00:52:39,931 --> 00:52:42,765
a man came to complain
about his missing wife.

685
00:52:43,306 --> 00:52:44,931
I didn't take it seriously then.

686
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:48,181
I said she must be pissed,
she'll return in two days.

687
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:52,806
Two days later, there was only news
about her body being found.

688
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:55,890
The case went to another officer.

689
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,265
But I've still not been able to
give him the answers.

690
00:52:59,306 --> 00:53:04,181
I wanted to give Jessica's husband
all the answers.

691
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,390
But it's too late.

692
00:53:05,931 --> 00:53:09,306
But I'll put an end to this case soon.

693
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:24,366
Try to understand, please.

694
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:29,515
That day, what happened was, I went to my
friend's house, they invited me for drinks.

695
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,931
Thirupathi.
Sir?

696
00:53:31,431 --> 00:53:33,181
Ask him to turn off his cell phone.

697
00:53:33,473 --> 00:53:36,324
He looks like a rich guy
but not very smart.

698
00:53:36,348 --> 00:53:37,931
Please try to understand!

699
00:53:38,931 --> 00:53:40,431
What?
Please cut the call.

700
00:53:40,765 --> 00:53:41,532
So what?

701
00:53:41,556 --> 00:53:45,055
This is a petrol bunk.
If it explodes, we'll all blast away.

702
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:46,473
No problem. It's my privacy.

703
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:47,431
Privacy?

704
00:53:48,473 --> 00:53:51,931
He's going to burn up the petrol bunk
with his sizzling romance.

705
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:53,265
I'm exit.

706
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:56,806
Last week, Wednesday evening, 4:30 pm...

707
00:53:56,931 --> 00:54:02,723
Someone filled 72.5 liters
petrol for 4,422 rupees.

708
00:54:03,265 --> 00:54:04,931
I know it's not easy to remember.

709
00:54:05,056 --> 00:54:09,181
But if any of you can recall,
please let me know.

710
00:54:09,765 --> 00:54:10,931
How much?

711
00:54:11,598 --> 00:54:13,390
72.5 liters.

712
00:54:13,515 --> 00:54:16,390
No one fills for 72.5 liters.

713
00:54:16,765 --> 00:54:18,515
They must have filled the tank.

714
00:54:19,306 --> 00:54:23,390
60-80 liters means Scorpio or Fortuner.

715
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,074
What about Audi A 6?

716
00:54:26,098 --> 00:54:27,598
60 liters.

717
00:54:28,931 --> 00:54:32,306
Yes, sir. A Fortuner car did
fill their tank on that day.

718
00:54:32,473 --> 00:54:33,931
How come you're so sure?

719
00:54:34,265 --> 00:54:35,616
It was my wife's birthday.

720
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:38,556
I filled petrol for that car
right before my shift ended.

721
00:54:38,681 --> 00:54:39,723
A black car.

722
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:41,931
Manager.
Sir?

723
00:54:42,931 --> 00:54:45,223
I want to check the CCTV footage.
Okay, sir.

724
00:54:48,348 --> 00:54:49,348
Tell me.

725
00:54:49,473 --> 00:54:50,491
Where are you?

726
00:54:50,515 --> 00:54:52,157
I'm on an inquiry about Jessica.

727
00:54:52,181 --> 00:54:55,347
I'll be late if I wait for you to pick me
up. Shall I come to the cinema directly?

728
00:54:55,348 --> 00:54:56,991
Sizzling romance here too?

729
00:54:57,015 --> 00:54:58,223
Oh, sorry.

730
00:54:58,681 --> 00:55:00,848
Looks like I'm your second wife.

731
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,515
What do you mean?

732
00:55:04,848 --> 00:55:07,199
That's why you're always
with your first wife.

733
00:55:07,223 --> 00:55:09,140
Oh, darn!

734
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:10,324
What happened?

735
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:12,074
I forgot to remove the clothes from drier.

736
00:55:12,098 --> 00:55:13,765
Okay, I'll call you back.
Bye.

737
00:55:14,473 --> 00:55:16,390
What?
Is it ready?

738
00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:19,199
We're checking the time
you asked us to check.

739
00:55:19,223 --> 00:55:21,390
Yeah.
Maximize Camera-2.

740
00:55:26,931 --> 00:55:28,181
Fast-forward a bit.

741
00:55:28,598 --> 00:55:30,181
Forward... forward, forward...

742
00:55:30,723 --> 00:55:31,640
Yeah...

743
00:55:32,056 --> 00:55:32,931
Stop! Stop!

744
00:55:33,056 --> 00:55:34,348
Back, back, back.

745
00:55:35,056 --> 00:55:36,056
A little more.

746
00:55:36,515 --> 00:55:38,390
Yeah. Move it frame by frame.

747
00:55:41,098 --> 00:55:41,931
Slow.
<font color="#ff0000"><i>MAZE HDRelease</i></font>

748
00:55:42,223 --> 00:55:43,056
Freeze!

749
00:55:43,265 --> 00:55:44,556
Sir, this is the vehicle.

750
00:56:06,015 --> 00:56:07,473
Zoom into the driver's side.

751
00:56:21,473 --> 00:56:23,556
The focus isn't clear.
Move to the next seat.

752
00:56:24,098 --> 00:56:25,181
Full tight.

753
00:56:58,265 --> 00:57:00,348
Thendral, I was just going to call you.

754
00:57:00,473 --> 00:57:01,597
What is it?

755
00:57:01,598 --> 00:57:04,157
I told you about the guy I saw in the car,
at the church...

756
00:57:04,181 --> 00:57:07,098
Yeah... He's come
here looking for me.

757
00:57:07,306 --> 00:57:08,265
What are you saying?

758
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:09,473
In the same car!

759
00:57:09,848 --> 00:57:11,157
Not just him.

760
00:57:11,181 --> 00:57:14,181
The guy who snatched my chain
the other day... he's here too.

761
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:15,723
And two other guys.

762
00:57:15,848 --> 00:57:16,930
Where are you?

763
00:57:16,931 --> 00:57:18,015
I'm at home.

764
00:57:18,181 --> 00:57:20,366
Just do as I say.
First, go lock the main door.

765
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:21,157
Why?

766
00:57:21,181 --> 00:57:22,515
Just do as I say!

767
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,181
Go lock the main door.

768
00:57:24,306 --> 00:57:25,347
Thirupathi!
Sir?

769
00:57:25,348 --> 00:57:26,265
I need a bike.

770
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:28,015
Bike?
Let's go for a movie today.

771
00:57:28,223 --> 00:57:29,574
The bike is ready, sir!

772
00:57:29,598 --> 00:57:31,098
Seize that guy!

773
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:33,223
Lock all the other doors.

774
00:57:39,681 --> 00:57:40,848
Who is at home?

775
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:43,515
Just dad and I...
Should I tell dad?

776
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,390
No, he'll get worked up.

777
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,407
What else?
Should I call the police?

778
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:49,931
Hang up and call them!

779
00:57:50,056 --> 00:57:51,431
Sorry, sorry!

780
00:57:51,556 --> 00:57:53,598
Okay, don't hang up.
Stay on the line.

781
00:57:58,765 --> 00:58:01,098
Don't talk to that guy.
I really don't like him.

782
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:03,140
Look, I don't want you to talk to him.

783
00:58:03,806 --> 00:58:04,598
Yeah, that's it.

784
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:06,681
Shameless bugger!

785
00:58:06,848 --> 00:58:09,931
He's getting ready for action,
but his wife is already gone!

786
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:11,556
Thendral? Can you hear me?

787
00:58:11,848 --> 00:58:14,223
Turn off all the electrical
appliances at home.

788
00:58:16,556 --> 00:58:18,555
I've... turned everything off.

789
00:58:18,556 --> 00:58:20,848
Sit by the viewfinder at the main door.

790
00:58:24,015 --> 00:58:28,306
Friends, neighbours, whoever rings the
bell, don't open the door for anyone.

791
00:58:28,431 --> 00:58:29,931
Okay?
Don't let your dad open the door, too.

792
00:58:30,056 --> 00:58:32,765
At any cost, whoever it might be,
don't open the door. Don't open...

793
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:36,640
Shit!

794
00:59:40,848 --> 00:59:42,282
There is no vehicle down there.

795
00:59:42,306 --> 00:59:44,348
Yeah... there's no one there.

796
00:59:44,806 --> 00:59:46,140
I don't get it.

797
00:59:46,348 --> 00:59:48,723
Don't open the door till I say so.
Remain indoors.

798
00:59:53,806 --> 00:59:54,616
Sir?

799
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,681
Where are you coming from?
Second floor, sir.

800
00:59:57,931 --> 00:59:59,556
Did you see a car parked here?

801
01:00:00,015 --> 01:00:01,556
No, sir. I didn't see any vehicle.

802
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:03,848
Fine, go.
Okay.

803
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:52,931
Sir, all surrounding traffic signals
have been instructed to trace that jeep.

804
01:00:53,598 --> 01:00:54,515
Okay.

805
01:00:54,723 --> 01:00:56,616
Check all the surrounding streets.

806
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,765
Okay, sir.
Okay, sir.

807
01:01:02,848 --> 01:01:05,265
Hey... did they come for real?

808
01:01:05,848 --> 01:01:07,806
Or was this your plan to get me here?

809
01:01:08,015 --> 01:01:09,930
I'm so tensed, and you're joking?

810
01:01:09,931 --> 01:01:11,556
Okay, okay. Cool!

811
01:01:11,931 --> 01:01:15,074
I've got two plain-clothed policemen
in charge of security for your house.

812
01:01:15,098 --> 01:01:16,806
For security?
Yeah.

813
01:01:16,931 --> 01:01:21,265
They've followed you all the way home.
We can't take it lightly anymore.

814
01:01:21,473 --> 01:01:24,806
You said the clue to one murder
would be another murder...

815
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:26,931
I might have become your clue!

816
01:01:27,056 --> 01:01:28,848
Why are you saying such things?

817
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:30,848
This case will be solved in a week.

818
01:01:31,181 --> 01:01:34,015
I don't know if you were
telling the truth...

819
01:01:34,348 --> 01:01:36,681
But I've come all the way just for you.

820
01:01:37,015 --> 01:01:38,907
Can't you get me a glass of chilled water?

821
01:01:38,931 --> 01:01:39,890
Why should I?

822
01:01:40,015 --> 01:01:42,431
Like all cops,
you turned up only in the end!

823
01:01:43,056 --> 01:01:45,616
You won't?
It's not like my house is miles away!

824
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,015
I'll go home and drink.

825
01:01:49,056 --> 01:01:51,931
Let's not tell our parents anything.
They'll worry.

826
01:01:52,265 --> 01:01:54,556
Hey, firstly this is official for me.

827
01:01:54,931 --> 01:01:58,116
As a police officer,
I know when to divulge information.

828
01:01:58,140 --> 01:01:58,931
Okay?

829
01:01:59,723 --> 01:02:02,140
You take care.
I'll call back. Bye.

830
01:03:09,258 --> 01:03:10,442
Shaktivel...
Sir?

831
01:03:10,466 --> 01:03:12,841
Is the post-mortem report ready?
It is, sir.

832
01:03:14,049 --> 01:03:16,382
Have you cross-checked the time of death?
Yes, sir.

833
01:03:16,383 --> 01:03:17,716
Abhi...

834
01:03:20,091 --> 01:03:23,508
When I got her married into this family,
I thought my girl would be happy.

835
01:03:24,049 --> 01:03:27,091
Now she's died so young!

836
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:32,716
Abhi used to tell me...

837
01:03:33,133 --> 01:03:35,091
"More than being a good wife...

838
01:03:36,049 --> 01:03:39,424
it's important to become a mother."

839
01:03:39,799 --> 01:03:41,716
"Like everyone says..."

840
01:03:42,466 --> 01:03:44,674
"I'm just a child bearing machine, right?"

841
01:03:44,924 --> 01:03:47,299
"I don't have any value or respect."

842
01:03:47,799 --> 01:03:49,549
She kept talking that way.

843
01:03:51,508 --> 01:03:54,341
I don't know what made her
come to this decision.

844
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:05,133
Excuse me, sir.

845
01:04:08,633 --> 01:04:10,817
According to the post-mortem report,
there are no injuries.

846
01:04:10,841 --> 01:04:13,133
There's a bruise on the neck
from strangulation.

847
01:04:13,299 --> 01:04:16,258
Internally, her wind pipe has been damaged.

848
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:19,799
There are no signs of intruders.

849
01:04:19,966 --> 01:04:23,942
According to your mother and brother's
statement, no money or jewels have gone missing.

850
01:04:23,966 --> 01:04:26,775
As of now, it's a suicide, sir.

851
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:27,734
But...

852
01:04:27,758 --> 01:04:31,133
We need to inquire your brother
about the motive.

853
01:04:31,841 --> 01:04:35,216
What did we ask you?
We only wanted a baby!

854
01:04:35,674 --> 01:04:40,258
When the Gods had finally blessed us,
you've ruined everything now.

855
01:04:41,383 --> 01:04:42,841
You didn't ask for anything?

856
01:04:44,466 --> 01:04:47,008
We said we'll give you
the money you asked for.

857
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:50,049
But you killed my daughter before that!

858
01:04:51,966 --> 01:04:54,466
Inform me after the interrogation
reports are done. Sure, sir.

859
01:04:56,716 --> 01:04:58,840
What money?
Who asked for it?

860
01:04:58,841 --> 01:05:00,673
Why are they talking that way?

861
01:05:00,674 --> 01:05:03,258
If it wasn't you,
why did she ask for 5 million?

862
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:06,008
Her dad said he'll arrange for it, too.

863
01:05:08,591 --> 01:05:09,633
We asked for money?

864
01:05:09,758 --> 01:05:12,133
If not you,
it must have been your son.

865
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:14,841
You couldn't wait for two days?

866
01:05:15,174 --> 01:05:17,924
If you'd waited,
my daughter wouldn't have died.

867
01:05:18,341 --> 01:05:19,966
Why is she talking this way?

868
01:05:20,174 --> 01:05:22,174
That's an unfair accusation!

869
01:05:22,383 --> 01:05:24,174
What wrong did we do?

870
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:27,924
Wonder what my child went though,
in this house...

871
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:30,049
Oh, my child!

872
01:05:44,924 --> 01:05:48,216
Vetri, you might hold your brother
and sister-in-law in such high regard...

873
01:05:49,758 --> 01:05:51,049
But I don't feel that way.

874
01:05:53,341 --> 01:05:55,174
Whatever it is, speak clearly.

875
01:05:57,049 --> 01:06:00,924
I had posted the family
group selfie on Facebook.

876
01:06:01,341 --> 01:06:04,674
My friend Rekha saw the picture
and called me up.

877
01:06:05,133 --> 01:06:07,716
When I mentioned
your sister-in-law's pregnancy...

878
01:06:08,424 --> 01:06:10,924
She told me something about your brother.

879
01:06:11,674 --> 01:06:12,716
What did she say?

880
01:06:12,841 --> 01:06:14,174
She's a doctor.

881
01:06:14,674 --> 01:06:19,091
Six months back, your brother had gone
to the fertility clinic where she works.

882
01:06:19,716 --> 01:06:24,091
Tests revealed your brother doesn't
have even a 10% chance to procreate.

883
01:06:24,841 --> 01:06:27,174
She said it couldn't be cured
with any treatment.

884
01:06:27,716 --> 01:06:32,383
She said it was surprising
that his wife is pregnant.

885
01:06:34,174 --> 01:06:35,424
Forget what she said.

886
01:06:36,216 --> 01:06:37,466
What are you trying to say?

887
01:06:37,841 --> 01:06:39,508
What's there to say, Vetri?

888
01:06:41,133 --> 01:06:47,299
Maybe an old contact from her workplace,
or an extra-marital affair...?

889
01:07:12,758 --> 01:07:13,484
Sir!

890
01:07:13,508 --> 01:07:15,091
Good morning, sir.

891
01:07:15,299 --> 01:07:16,299
Good morning, sir.

892
01:07:17,049 --> 01:07:17,734
Sir!

893
01:07:17,758 --> 01:07:19,692
Good morning.
The files he asked for?

894
01:07:19,716 --> 01:07:21,008
All files are ready, sir.

895
01:07:25,716 --> 01:07:26,549
Sir?

896
01:07:27,216 --> 01:07:29,383
Abhinaya's interrogation reports...
sorry, sir.

897
01:07:29,508 --> 01:07:32,091
Your sister-in-law's reports
just came in.

898
01:08:10,549 --> 01:08:11,549
Thirupathi!

899
01:08:12,216 --> 01:08:12,984
Sir?

900
01:08:13,008 --> 01:08:14,841
Get me Jessica's autopsy report.

901
01:08:17,341 --> 01:08:18,174
Here, sir.

902
01:08:37,591 --> 01:08:40,435
This medicine will aid the secretion of

903
01:08:40,459 --> 01:08:43,657
hormones that facilitate
the growth of eggs.

904
01:08:43,841 --> 01:08:47,008
It's also used as a fertility drug
for artificial pregnancies.

905
01:08:48,466 --> 01:08:50,299
Artificial pregnancy?

906
01:08:51,049 --> 01:08:52,590
You mean test tube baby?

907
01:08:52,591 --> 01:08:54,799
No! Not necessarily that...

908
01:08:54,924 --> 01:08:58,299
Like I.V.F, I.C.I...
there are many processes and methods.

909
01:08:58,716 --> 01:09:02,591
Since both these cases are unnatural deaths,
I have another point to add, Vetri.

910
01:09:02,924 --> 01:09:03,758
Yes, Doctor?

911
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:08,782
There was a case last month. Minister
Vaidyalingam's daughter-in-law committed suicide.

912
01:09:09,383 --> 01:09:11,150
At Anna Nagar West?
Exactly.

913
01:09:11,174 --> 01:09:14,091
We found traces of this
medicine in her body, too.

914
01:09:15,133 --> 01:09:17,900
Because of his political status,
it was barely covered by the media.

915
01:09:17,924 --> 01:09:19,591
You'd have noticed.
Yes, doctor.

916
01:09:20,258 --> 01:09:22,466
But all three have died.

917
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:24,966
Where do you think the problem lies?

918
01:09:25,133 --> 01:09:27,258
We can't start suspecting everybody.

919
01:09:27,841 --> 01:09:31,299
But if we interrogate their husbands,
we might find some clue.

920
01:09:37,008 --> 01:09:39,633
You eat your food.
I'll give dad his tablets.

921
01:09:51,508 --> 01:09:53,424
Come... you're late, too?

922
01:09:56,008 --> 01:09:59,049
I got a little held up working
on sister-in-law's case.

923
01:10:06,549 --> 01:10:08,174
How could you do this?

924
01:10:09,674 --> 01:10:10,424
Do what?

925
01:10:11,549 --> 01:10:12,841
Lie blatantly.

926
01:10:14,924 --> 01:10:16,508
You lied to the police...

927
01:10:17,049 --> 01:10:18,674
But you shouldn't have lied to me.

928
01:10:19,591 --> 01:10:20,508
Lie?

929
01:10:20,799 --> 01:10:21,758
What are you saying?

930
01:10:22,466 --> 01:10:23,716
About sister-in-law.

931
01:10:26,174 --> 01:10:27,341
What about her?

932
01:10:31,466 --> 01:10:33,049
Why did you kill her?

933
01:10:34,674 --> 01:10:35,966
What are you blabbering?

934
01:10:41,216 --> 01:10:43,549
Was she really bearing your child?

935
01:10:44,633 --> 01:10:45,775
What did you say?

936
01:10:45,799 --> 01:10:47,548
What did you say about her?

937
01:10:47,549 --> 01:10:48,673
Take your hands off me...

938
01:10:48,674 --> 01:10:51,423
Tell me the truth!
You think you can say whatever you want?

939
01:10:51,424 --> 01:10:53,466
Why did you hide the truth?
Tell me.

940
01:10:54,091 --> 01:10:55,508
Don't you think it was wrong?

941
01:10:55,841 --> 01:10:57,258
What am I hiding?

942
01:10:57,799 --> 01:10:58,775
What am I hiding?

943
01:10:58,799 --> 01:11:00,841
You're hiding something, tell me!

944
01:11:01,008 --> 01:11:03,049
Vetri! Oh my god...

945
01:11:03,258 --> 01:11:04,650
What are you both doing?

946
01:11:04,674 --> 01:11:06,216
Let him go.
Let go of me!

947
01:11:06,549 --> 01:11:09,192
Let go of each other.
Why are you two fighting?

948
01:11:09,216 --> 01:11:12,109
What happened to you guys?
What are you doing?

949
01:11:12,133 --> 01:11:14,716
He's hiding something about sister-in-law.
Ask him to come out with it!

950
01:11:14,841 --> 01:11:17,234
Have you gone mad?
I'm not hiding anything.

951
01:11:17,258 --> 01:11:19,567
Why are you two fighting
over someone who is dead?

952
01:11:19,591 --> 01:11:21,758
No... she didn't just die.

953
01:11:21,924 --> 01:11:23,609
You've all killed her.

954
01:11:23,633 --> 01:11:25,025
What are you saying?

955
01:11:25,049 --> 01:11:27,817
Yes... Since the day
he got married...

956
01:11:27,841 --> 01:11:30,299
you've only been complaining
about the lack of a grandchild!

957
01:11:31,466 --> 01:11:33,841
I've seen you point the
finger at her several times!

958
01:11:34,549 --> 01:11:38,174
Every time someone comes home,
they keep asking if there's good news.

959
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:41,067
Every time she steps out,
they ask her if she's made it.

960
01:11:41,091 --> 01:11:44,383
Some doctor, some hospital...
you just want a baby somehow, right?

961
01:11:45,091 --> 01:11:46,359
Isn't that want you want?

962
01:11:46,383 --> 01:11:47,609
It's not like that...

963
01:11:47,633 --> 01:11:49,734
You've asked your daughter-in-law
so many times...

964
01:11:49,758 --> 01:11:51,633
Have you asked your son at least once?

965
01:11:53,841 --> 01:11:54,841
Answer me.

966
01:11:56,758 --> 01:11:57,716
Ask him to answer me!

967
01:11:57,717 --> 01:11:58,841
Yeah, fine!

968
01:12:00,341 --> 01:12:01,799
The fault is with me.

969
01:12:02,674 --> 01:12:03,841
The fault is mine.

970
01:12:04,383 --> 01:12:05,549
I made a mistake.

971
01:12:06,091 --> 01:12:07,966
But it's not what you think it is!

972
01:12:10,258 --> 01:12:11,591
You know very well...

973
01:12:11,924 --> 01:12:15,424
My wife and I visited so many hospitals,
doctors, and went on so many pilgrimages.

974
01:12:16,591 --> 01:12:20,466
Finally, we got an appointment
at a reputed hospital.

975
01:12:32,591 --> 01:12:34,383
Is this your first visit to our hospital?

976
01:12:34,549 --> 01:12:35,674
Yes, doctor.

977
01:12:36,174 --> 01:12:37,734
Where do you work?

978
01:12:37,758 --> 01:12:39,799
I work as a Chief Engineer at RK Steels.

979
01:12:40,133 --> 01:12:42,674
Then you must be exposed
to a lot of heat at work.

980
01:12:45,008 --> 01:12:46,966
You have a healthy sex life.

981
01:12:47,258 --> 01:12:49,109
But if you're thinking about a baby...

982
01:12:49,133 --> 01:12:56,091
Your sperm count might be normal,
but it lacks mobility, health and speed.

983
01:12:56,758 --> 01:12:59,591
Fifty out of hundred couples
suffer from this problem these days.

984
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:04,424
The reasons are several... the work
atmosphere, mental stress, diet etc.

985
01:13:04,924 --> 01:13:06,758
This isn't a permanent problem.

986
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:12,133
Through proper treatment, we can increase
the quality of your sperm and have a child.

987
01:13:13,549 --> 01:13:15,383
How long does this
treatment require, doctor?

988
01:13:16,633 --> 01:13:18,341
One year at least.

989
01:13:19,258 --> 01:13:21,442
If I undergo this treatment,
will everything be okay?

990
01:13:21,466 --> 01:13:24,049
I can give you a sixty percent assurance...

991
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:27,216
The remaining forty percent,
it lies in the hands of God.

992
01:13:29,716 --> 01:13:32,758
If you think you can't wait that long...

993
01:13:33,341 --> 01:13:34,633
there's another method.

994
01:13:36,549 --> 01:13:37,734
What's that method, doctor?

995
01:13:37,758 --> 01:13:39,424
Artificial insemination.

996
01:13:42,008 --> 01:13:43,091
What does that mean?

997
01:13:45,383 --> 01:13:50,692
That means, for those who can't conceive
naturally, through injection...

998
01:13:50,716 --> 01:13:53,716
your sperm can be fused
in your wife's womb.

999
01:13:54,133 --> 01:13:56,716
The chance of conception
is 100%.

1000
01:14:04,174 --> 01:14:05,900
What's there to think?

1001
01:14:05,924 --> 01:14:09,465
So many women who can't conceive
through their husbands..

1002
01:14:09,466 --> 01:14:12,799
Use someone else's sperm
to have a child, legally.

1003
01:14:13,299 --> 01:14:16,091
This is your husband's sperm!

1004
01:14:16,341 --> 01:14:17,633
Why hesitate?

1005
01:14:37,549 --> 01:14:39,758
Name, please?
Shri Abhinaya.

1006
01:14:43,799 --> 01:14:44,841
Abhi?
Yes?

1007
01:14:45,841 --> 01:14:47,591
You're happy, right?

1008
01:14:48,258 --> 01:14:50,341
I am happy...

1009
01:14:51,424 --> 01:14:54,216
But I don't know how mom and dad
would react to this.

1010
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:56,216
Why would they mistake us?

1011
01:14:56,633 --> 01:14:57,984
I'll talk to them.

1012
01:14:58,008 --> 01:14:59,008
No, dear.

1013
01:14:59,174 --> 01:15:01,091
Let no one know about this.

1014
01:15:01,258 --> 01:15:03,091
Let's not tell our parents either.

1015
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:07,133
Let's not even tell Vetri about this.
Please.

1016
01:15:07,633 --> 01:15:09,633
Okay, I won't.
Don't worry.

1017
01:15:11,133 --> 01:15:14,133
After two months of proper follow up,
the treatment started.

1018
01:15:14,258 --> 01:15:17,758
We found results
for waiting all these years.

1019
01:15:18,049 --> 01:15:20,466
You knew how happy we were.

1020
01:15:20,758 --> 01:15:23,965
But I didn't ask for the 5 million
you accuse me of!

1021
01:15:23,966 --> 01:15:26,216
The hospital didn't want
such a huge amount either.

1022
01:15:29,466 --> 01:15:30,758
Madam, one selfie please?

1023
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:39,716
Sir, you can go in.
Thank you.

1024
01:15:40,049 --> 01:15:41,383
Please be seated.
Thank you.

1025
01:15:46,508 --> 01:15:49,025
They said you're the brother-in-law
of the deceased Abhinaya.

1026
01:15:49,049 --> 01:15:50,840
Really, it's such a pity.

1027
01:15:50,841 --> 01:15:53,258
I don't know what drove her
to commit suicide.

1028
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:55,841
She'd have had a baby in her hands
in another five months.

1029
01:15:56,633 --> 01:16:00,716
Is it really safe to have a baby
through artificial insemination, doctor?

1030
01:16:01,008 --> 01:16:02,383
What do you mean?

1031
01:16:02,758 --> 01:16:04,716
There are no chances of risk.

1032
01:16:05,133 --> 01:16:08,150
It's childish of you to say this
because your sister-in-law died.

1033
01:16:08,174 --> 01:16:09,674
Not just my sister-in-law...

1034
01:16:09,841 --> 01:16:12,549
Three other women who underwent artificial
insemination have died.

1035
01:16:14,091 --> 01:16:15,466
Is this childish to you?

1036
01:16:17,008 --> 01:16:18,091
Excuse me.

1037
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:20,567
You ask me about sister-in-law,
that's fine...

1038
01:16:20,591 --> 01:16:23,109
Why do you unnecessarily
ask me about other people?

1039
01:16:23,133 --> 01:16:25,049
The police must ask questions.

1040
01:16:33,424 --> 01:16:34,508
I'm sorry.

1041
01:16:34,758 --> 01:16:37,067
I only wanted to have a
conversation with you...

1042
01:16:37,091 --> 01:16:40,424
But the way you spoke now...
this turned into an inquiry.

1043
01:16:41,633 --> 01:16:45,424
Another hospital had given reports
that my brother can't have a baby.

1044
01:16:45,674 --> 01:16:47,174
What do you have to say about this?

1045
01:16:48,133 --> 01:16:49,150
Simple!

1046
01:16:49,174 --> 01:16:52,924
You go to a doctor with a headache, one
might tell you it's an ordinary headache.

1047
01:16:53,133 --> 01:16:55,049
Another doctor might say it's dehydration.

1048
01:16:55,216 --> 01:16:57,275
Another doctor might ask for an MRI scan.

1049
01:16:57,299 --> 01:17:00,567
The point is correct
diagnosis and treatment.

1050
01:17:00,591 --> 01:17:06,174
Some doctors make big bucks
by saying a normal headache is a tumor.

1051
01:17:06,924 --> 01:17:08,716
Just saying.
Thirupathi!

1052
01:17:08,841 --> 01:17:10,150
Why are you suspicious?

1053
01:17:10,174 --> 01:17:13,275
Didn't you see them outside?
TV celebrities, Madhan-Kausalya.

1054
01:17:13,299 --> 01:17:16,633
Even they underwent an artificial
insemination, through legal means.

1055
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:19,133
We maintain those records confidentially.

1056
01:17:19,966 --> 01:17:22,758
Like the couple who elope secretly
and post the selfie on Facebook!

1057
01:17:23,466 --> 01:17:26,258
I meant... you maintain secrets
really well! Keep it up.

1058
01:17:26,424 --> 01:17:27,275
Anyway...

1059
01:17:27,299 --> 01:17:31,091
How many of your hospital's franchises
are involved in artificial insemination?

1060
01:17:31,216 --> 01:17:36,174
Who were the patients?
I want the complete details.

1061
01:17:36,841 --> 01:17:38,984
Specifically, your hospital reports.

1062
01:17:39,008 --> 01:17:41,841
You can get those only at the
Indian Medical Association.

1063
01:17:42,091 --> 01:17:43,924
But you need legal permission for that.

1064
01:17:44,258 --> 01:17:45,525
It isn't easy.

1065
01:17:45,549 --> 01:17:47,924
You husband isn't just
this hospital's Dean...

1066
01:17:48,091 --> 01:17:51,133
He's one of the board members at the
Indian Medical Association.

1067
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:53,067
So, you can do it.

1068
01:17:53,091 --> 01:17:56,299
Manual, and all electronic records.
Nothing should be left out.

1069
01:17:57,508 --> 01:17:59,525
Sure. I'll have it ready tomorrow morning.

1070
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:01,775
Sorry, ma'am.
I need it in two hours.

1071
01:18:01,799 --> 01:18:03,258
Well... okay!

1072
01:18:04,049 --> 01:18:05,758
I'll pass on the instructions.

1073
01:18:05,924 --> 01:18:08,008
If you don't mind,
can you make it now?

1074
01:18:15,049 --> 01:18:19,758
Immediately arrange for full reports on all patients
who underwent A.I. treatment at our hospital.

1075
01:18:23,799 --> 01:18:24,900
Thank you, doctor.

1076
01:18:24,924 --> 01:18:28,258
If I require any further details,
I'll contact you.

1077
01:18:28,758 --> 01:18:29,674
Sure.

1078
01:18:34,008 --> 01:18:36,133
What's with the sudden brakes, huh?

1079
01:18:38,174 --> 01:18:39,466
Balu Saloon!

1080
01:18:39,716 --> 01:18:41,234
A shave or a haircut?

1081
01:18:41,258 --> 01:18:43,173
Get me yesterday's copy
of Dinarakan newspaper.

1082
01:18:43,174 --> 01:18:44,008
Okay.

1083
01:18:47,674 --> 01:18:48,633
Here you go, sir.

1084
01:19:23,341 --> 01:19:24,008
Hello.

1085
01:19:24,216 --> 01:19:27,049
Tulasi here. You need to come.
We've got a situation.

1086
01:19:35,799 --> 01:19:36,633
Sir.

1087
01:19:36,883 --> 01:19:42,234
We've inquired everyone who underwent
artificial insemination at Varam Hospital.

1088
01:19:42,258 --> 01:19:43,174
Out of which...

1089
01:19:44,049 --> 01:19:49,383
Vidhya, your sister-in-law Abhinaya
and Jessica died after pregnancy.

1090
01:19:49,883 --> 01:19:52,150
All six suffered unnatural deaths.

1091
01:19:52,174 --> 01:19:55,008
Their families don't
know the reason either.

1092
01:19:55,133 --> 01:19:57,841
We don't know what or where
things went wrong...

1093
01:19:57,966 --> 01:20:00,674
Is it the hospital?
Or just a coincidence?

1094
01:20:01,133 --> 01:20:02,674
Or maybe...

1095
01:20:43,883 --> 01:20:44,966
What is it, sir?

1096
01:21:02,924 --> 01:21:04,424
I'm extremely sorry, Vetri.

1097
01:21:05,633 --> 01:21:08,049
What I said about your sister-in-law...

1098
01:21:08,841 --> 01:21:09,924
...was wrong.

1099
01:21:12,049 --> 01:21:16,133
When I was investigating Jessica's case,
my sister-in-law used to jokingly say...

1100
01:21:16,341 --> 01:21:19,424
"What's the big deal with this case?
I can help you with it."

1101
01:21:20,383 --> 01:21:22,258
Now she is a part of the case.

1102
01:21:22,883 --> 01:21:27,508
So you think you can solve these four cases
with her death?

1103
01:21:28,799 --> 01:21:30,008
Twenty three.

1104
01:21:31,258 --> 01:21:32,674
That will give me the answer.

1105
01:21:33,841 --> 01:21:38,258
In just this hospital, 436 people have
undergone artificial insemination treatments.

1106
01:21:39,341 --> 01:21:40,841
Six of them have died.

1107
01:21:41,258 --> 01:21:42,507
Apart from these people...

1108
01:21:42,508 --> 01:21:45,841
The files of about half the people
have been marked with the code '23'.

1109
01:21:46,758 --> 01:21:47,841
Above all this...

1110
01:21:47,966 --> 01:21:51,549
My sister-in-law had asked her parents for
5 million without our knowledge.

1111
01:21:54,008 --> 01:21:57,383
My brother nor the hospital
asked for this 5 million.

1112
01:21:57,883 --> 01:21:59,883
But someone needed the money.

1113
01:22:00,591 --> 01:22:01,549
Ma'am, bill.

1114
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:03,591
You never answer my calls at night.

1115
01:22:04,258 --> 01:22:06,133
Why?
Are you scared of your wife?

1116
01:22:07,924 --> 01:22:09,258
Bye!
Bye.

1117
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:10,966
Will you come to office tomorrow?

1118
01:22:11,674 --> 01:22:14,692
Don't tell your mom that we all met
this aunty and had ice-cream. Okay?

1119
01:22:14,716 --> 01:22:16,317
Oh, is that so?

1120
01:22:16,341 --> 01:22:19,674
If you want me to remain quiet,
get me another milkshake.

1121
01:22:19,841 --> 01:22:20,549
Sure!

1122
01:22:22,133 --> 01:22:23,508
Yay!
Yay.

1123
01:22:29,716 --> 01:22:32,133
If you don't mind,
can you drop me at the school?

1124
01:22:32,258 --> 01:22:33,466
I'm getting late.

1125
01:22:35,174 --> 01:22:36,841
Thendral...
Yes?

1126
01:22:37,008 --> 01:22:40,383
Looking at these incidents,
this could be a case of blackmail?

1127
01:22:47,966 --> 01:22:48,924
Thendral?

1128
01:22:49,174 --> 01:22:50,133
Thendral!

1129
01:22:53,591 --> 01:22:54,775
My god!

1130
01:22:54,799 --> 01:22:55,549
Shit!

1131
01:23:19,799 --> 01:23:22,799
I told you not to mess with a cop's family.
You didn't listen to me!

1132
01:23:23,216 --> 01:23:27,716
See... you shouldn't get sentiments
and emotions mixed up with business.

1133
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:29,674
The mistake wasn't messing with him.

1134
01:23:30,716 --> 01:23:33,258
Letting them both escape alive...
that was the mistake!

1135
01:23:34,841 --> 01:23:36,258
You screwed up.
Don't blame me!

1136
01:23:39,216 --> 01:23:42,091
Till we sort this out,
we'll put the next target on hold.

1137
01:23:42,633 --> 01:23:43,341
No.

1138
01:23:44,633 --> 01:23:47,133
We've started.
And it's a major target.

1139
01:23:47,633 --> 01:23:49,758
We should get the amount
within two days.

1140
01:23:50,591 --> 01:23:53,591
Don't trust the others.
You get the job done.

1141
01:23:53,966 --> 01:23:54,674
Got it?

1142
01:23:55,716 --> 01:23:56,133
Okay.

1143
01:24:01,716 --> 01:24:05,008
No trespassers. Don't allow anyone
inside without proper ID cards.

1144
01:24:05,466 --> 01:24:06,341
Including doctors.

1145
01:24:07,049 --> 01:24:08,341
Thank you.
Okay, sir.

1146
01:24:18,966 --> 01:24:20,716
I dragged you into such a great risk.

1147
01:24:21,091 --> 01:24:22,174
I'm extremely sorry.

1148
01:24:23,174 --> 01:24:26,174
Did they come to kill you,
or me?

1149
01:24:27,133 --> 01:24:29,091
Either way, your safety is important.

1150
01:24:29,591 --> 01:24:33,091
I've got two policemen on security
till you get discharged from the hospital.

1151
01:24:33,258 --> 01:24:34,174
Don't worry.

1152
01:24:34,341 --> 01:24:36,549
But you've put me in this hospital again?

1153
01:24:38,091 --> 01:24:39,258
Don't be afraid.

1154
01:24:39,674 --> 01:24:40,633
I'll take care.

1155
01:24:41,133 --> 01:24:42,424
You won't stay here with me?

1156
01:24:43,341 --> 01:24:45,091
I'll always be with you.

1157
01:24:46,133 --> 01:24:48,049
Is that a movie dialogue?

1158
01:24:49,633 --> 01:24:51,508
Okay, I have some work at office.

1159
01:24:51,883 --> 01:24:52,883
I'll be back.

1160
01:24:53,174 --> 01:24:54,133
Take rest.

1161
01:24:55,133 --> 01:24:55,966
Vetri...

1162
01:24:59,091 --> 01:25:00,716
Why should they blackmail someone?

1163
01:25:17,133 --> 01:25:20,008
I swear on my unborn baby...

1164
01:25:20,966 --> 01:25:22,716
I didn't do anything wrong.

1165
01:25:23,174 --> 01:25:24,966
Believe me, please.

1166
01:25:25,758 --> 01:25:27,341
Believe me.

1167
01:25:32,466 --> 01:25:33,383
Cloth?

1168
01:25:37,383 --> 01:25:38,674
Sorry, we're done for now.

1169
01:25:39,174 --> 01:25:40,341
That's enough, please move.

1170
01:25:42,258 --> 01:25:44,424
Madam, two police officers are here
to see you.

1171
01:25:46,591 --> 01:25:47,799
Okay, I'll take care.

1172
01:25:50,258 --> 01:25:51,359
Madam?

1173
01:25:51,383 --> 01:25:56,466
Watching your series, the whole country
has learnt how to raise a child.

1174
01:25:56,799 --> 01:25:58,567
I've laid the groundwork.
Your turn now.

1175
01:25:58,591 --> 01:26:01,924
I got to know at the hospital
that your wife has conceived.

1176
01:26:02,174 --> 01:26:03,258
Congratulations.

1177
01:26:03,633 --> 01:26:04,383
Thank you.

1178
01:26:05,466 --> 01:26:06,859
When you're a public figure...

1179
01:26:06,883 --> 01:26:10,383
competition, jealousy, money, enemies
are aplenty.

1180
01:26:10,549 --> 01:26:12,924
Have you made any such enemies recently?

1181
01:26:14,841 --> 01:26:16,049
Not particularly, sir.

1182
01:26:16,424 --> 01:26:17,484
I mean...

1183
01:26:17,508 --> 01:26:21,442
Has someone called you in the last week,
threatening you for money?

1184
01:26:21,466 --> 01:26:23,692
No sir, I received no
such threats or calls.

1185
01:26:23,716 --> 01:26:26,150
If something did happen,
you don't have to fear.

1186
01:26:26,174 --> 01:26:27,317
You can trust me.

1187
01:26:27,341 --> 01:26:30,234
My department and I will provide
all the support you need.

1188
01:26:30,258 --> 01:26:31,484
Sir...
No!

1189
01:26:31,508 --> 01:26:34,549
I'm telling you we got no such calls,
and you keep asking the same thing?

1190
01:26:37,174 --> 01:26:39,883
If something does happen, you
can call me anytime. Sir!

1191
01:26:40,383 --> 01:26:42,966
We said nothing happened.
Why do you keep asking us the same thing?

1192
01:26:44,508 --> 01:26:45,883
We need some privacy.

1193
01:27:08,841 --> 01:27:11,174
Anyway, thanks... just for the coffee!

1194
01:27:11,466 --> 01:27:13,716
I don't think you'll need my number.
See you.

1195
01:27:14,216 --> 01:27:18,216
How do you speak such lengthy dialogues?
Does someone write them, or you make it up?

1196
01:27:20,841 --> 01:27:23,859
Sir, she might be a little arrogant,
but she's a nice lady.

1197
01:27:23,883 --> 01:27:25,567
But I hate that guy's face.

1198
01:27:25,591 --> 01:27:27,900
They should fire this guy.

1199
01:27:27,924 --> 01:27:30,234
And cast someone else in his place.

1200
01:27:30,258 --> 01:27:31,234
Ravi.

1201
01:27:31,258 --> 01:27:33,466
TV artists Madhan and Kausalya.

1202
01:27:33,591 --> 01:27:37,258
Immediately tap both their
mobile and landline numbers.

1203
01:27:37,383 --> 01:27:40,067
Particularly, record all
the incoming calls.

1204
01:27:40,091 --> 01:27:41,091
I'm on my way.

1205
01:27:45,466 --> 01:27:46,400
Sir.

1206
01:27:46,424 --> 01:27:47,400
Good evening.

1207
01:27:47,424 --> 01:27:50,758
The numbers you wanted to tap...
there was an incoming call 5 minutes back.

1208
01:27:51,091 --> 01:27:53,008
I've recorded and saved it.

1209
01:27:55,091 --> 01:27:57,942
Why didn't you answer the phone?
I was at the shoot, so I couldn't.

1210
01:27:57,966 --> 01:28:00,008
When are you going to pay up?

1211
01:28:00,133 --> 01:28:02,174
Sorry, I couldn't cancel the shoot today.

1212
01:28:02,383 --> 01:28:04,049
I'll draw the money from the bank tomorrow.

1213
01:28:04,174 --> 01:28:06,716
Which bank?
SBI Bank in Saligramam.

1214
01:28:06,924 --> 01:28:08,549
You live in Valasaravakkam, right?
Yes.

1215
01:28:08,674 --> 01:28:10,674
After you get the money,
you'll get a call.

1216
01:28:10,924 --> 01:28:11,859
Okay.

1217
01:28:11,883 --> 01:28:14,716
If you disregard our deal
and go to the police instead...

1218
01:28:15,133 --> 01:28:17,549
You'll lose your status and public image.

1219
01:28:18,091 --> 01:28:20,049
No, that won't happen.

1220
01:28:20,258 --> 01:28:21,341
We'll definitely pay up.

1221
01:28:23,508 --> 01:28:24,841
The call lasted only 45 seconds.

1222
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:27,133
So it's difficult to trace the location.

1223
01:28:27,258 --> 01:28:30,716
Sir, the money will change hands either
at the bank, or at their house.

1224
01:28:31,549 --> 01:28:34,841
The bank and their house, they aren't
safe locations for the criminal.

1225
01:28:35,174 --> 01:28:38,674
The plan would be to get the money
somewhere on the way.

1226
01:28:39,174 --> 01:28:42,383
We'll get to know that
only if they call again.

1227
01:28:42,966 --> 01:28:45,174
I don't get why they're being blackmailed.

1228
01:28:48,424 --> 01:28:50,883
Last ten seconds...
rewind and replay it.

1229
01:28:52,424 --> 01:28:55,216
If you disregard our deal
and go to the police instead...

1230
01:28:55,633 --> 01:28:57,758
You'll lose your status and image.

1231
01:29:11,549 --> 01:29:12,966
Sir, they've left.

1232
01:29:15,133 --> 01:29:16,799
They've got into the car.

1233
01:29:16,924 --> 01:29:18,317
Guys, get started.

1234
01:29:18,341 --> 01:29:19,674
The department will pay for this!

1235
01:29:29,674 --> 01:29:30,900
Stop! Stop that.

1236
01:29:30,924 --> 01:29:32,841
Now you'll salute!

1237
01:29:37,924 --> 01:29:39,650
Sir, Madhan is getting a call.

1238
01:29:39,674 --> 01:29:40,674
Connect the call.

1239
01:29:42,883 --> 01:29:44,758
Sir, this is Kumar from Dindugul.

1240
01:29:45,008 --> 01:29:46,442
I'm a huge fan.

1241
01:29:46,466 --> 01:29:49,234
Your performance on TV last week
made me cry, sir!

1242
01:29:49,258 --> 01:29:51,258
Especially Madam,
she made me sob uncontrollably.

1243
01:29:51,383 --> 01:29:54,025
Sir, I need to know if you
fought with your wife.

1244
01:29:54,049 --> 01:29:56,067
Otherwise, my wife wouldn't believe
I spoke to you.

1245
01:29:56,091 --> 01:29:57,942
My wife is also a hardcore fan, sir.

1246
01:29:57,966 --> 01:30:00,900
Sir, will your wife remain at home next week,
or will she fight with you and leave the house?

1247
01:30:00,924 --> 01:30:03,067
What?
I meant in the TV show!

1248
01:30:03,091 --> 01:30:04,841
Tell her we got divorced.
Madam!

1249
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:06,549
Stupid...

1250
01:30:07,924 --> 01:30:09,984
Thirupathi, make a U turn and wait.

1251
01:30:10,008 --> 01:30:11,466
Turn left.

1252
01:30:31,341 --> 01:30:34,174
The signal is on,
and there is no one yet.

1253
01:31:03,383 --> 01:31:04,674
Everyone be alert.

1254
01:31:10,924 --> 01:31:12,508
The signal has turned green!

1255
01:31:33,341 --> 01:31:35,049
Don't stop the car.
Go straight.

1256
01:31:35,924 --> 01:31:36,966
Go! Go!

1257
01:31:37,966 --> 01:31:39,049
Go on!

1258
01:31:40,508 --> 01:31:41,508
Shit!

1259
01:31:47,758 --> 01:31:49,883
He's in the vehicle!
Come!

1260
01:31:50,508 --> 01:31:51,549
Move!

1261
01:31:52,799 --> 01:31:53,799
Come on, fast.

1262
01:32:04,258 --> 01:32:06,174
Thirupathi, ask the ambulance to follow.

1263
01:32:25,758 --> 01:32:26,799
Get out!

1264
01:32:28,549 --> 01:32:29,049
Shit.
<b><font color="#ff0000"><i>MAZE HDRelease</i></font></b>

1265
01:32:30,758 --> 01:32:32,133
Get out.
Out!

1266
01:32:32,508 --> 01:32:34,109
Check all around!

1267
01:32:34,133 --> 01:32:36,216
Why did you stop us?

1268
01:32:36,383 --> 01:32:38,775
Where is the man
who got into your car?

1269
01:32:38,799 --> 01:32:40,549
Where is he?

1270
01:32:41,174 --> 01:32:42,091
Shit!

1271
01:32:45,258 --> 01:32:46,383
Damn it.

1272
01:32:51,633 --> 01:32:53,674
It's a failed attempt.

1273
01:32:54,466 --> 01:32:55,508
It's not!

1274
01:37:02,966 --> 01:37:04,174
Are you okay, sir?

1275
01:37:17,883 --> 01:37:19,025
Stop it!

1276
01:37:19,049 --> 01:37:20,216
Stop it.

1277
01:37:21,341 --> 01:37:22,549
Stop it...

1278
01:37:26,716 --> 01:37:30,383
When the department conducts an operation,
there are always two plans.

1279
01:37:30,883 --> 01:37:33,299
Plan A... and Plan B.

1280
01:37:34,508 --> 01:37:36,633
You got caught in Plan B.

1281
01:37:45,966 --> 01:37:46,966
Tell me...

1282
01:37:47,424 --> 01:37:49,174
Why did you blackmail them?

1283
01:37:50,549 --> 01:37:53,424
Father... Jessica... Vidhya...

1284
01:37:53,633 --> 01:37:55,091
My sister-in-law, Abhinaya...

1285
01:37:55,299 --> 01:37:57,133
and countless other people.

1286
01:37:57,883 --> 01:37:59,466
You need to give me answers.

1287
01:38:09,299 --> 01:38:10,633
Stop it!

1288
01:38:12,174 --> 01:38:13,133
Stop it.

1289
01:38:13,424 --> 01:38:14,341
Stop it.

1290
01:38:18,591 --> 01:38:19,674
Record.

1291
01:38:26,633 --> 01:38:27,966
I'm not afraid.

1292
01:38:28,549 --> 01:38:30,859
The day our crimes are exposed...

1293
01:38:30,883 --> 01:38:33,883
the crimes of the others
would be exposed, too.

1294
01:38:34,674 --> 01:38:36,091
So tell me...

1295
01:38:36,633 --> 01:38:38,216
What's happening at the hospital?

1296
01:38:38,633 --> 01:38:40,508
What are the doctors doing?

1297
01:38:40,966 --> 01:38:42,133
Doctors!

1298
01:38:43,091 --> 01:38:44,966
You think it's just the doctors?

1299
01:38:46,799 --> 01:38:47,883
Jessica.

1300
01:38:48,091 --> 01:38:50,299
Ski TV MD's wife.

1301
01:38:50,883 --> 01:38:53,424
You only know she's a big cricket fan.

1302
01:38:53,799 --> 01:38:57,966
She was a mad fan of
the all-rounder, Vinod Mehra.

1303
01:38:58,258 --> 01:39:00,674
Fans get autographs, or click photos.

1304
01:39:01,049 --> 01:39:03,799
But you know what she did?

1305
01:39:04,174 --> 01:39:09,424
She was obsessed with having a baby
who'd be a cricket player like him.

1306
01:39:09,633 --> 01:39:17,258
So she paid several millions to get his sperm
cells from Varam hospital's sperm bank.

1307
01:39:17,508 --> 01:39:20,508
That too, without her
husband's knowledge.

1308
01:39:21,591 --> 01:39:23,424
Minister Durai Singam.

1309
01:39:25,508 --> 01:39:28,067
He wasn't bothered about his son's
inability to have a baby.

1310
01:39:28,091 --> 01:39:31,025
He was more worried
about having a political heir.

1311
01:39:31,049 --> 01:39:34,258
But because his son couldn't...

1312
01:39:34,716 --> 01:39:37,341
He made his own daughter-in-law...

1313
01:39:38,466 --> 01:39:40,758
use his sperm cells to...

1314
01:39:44,049 --> 01:39:46,049
Whose fault is it?

1315
01:39:46,549 --> 01:39:50,049
When others make a mistake for money,
should I protest?

1316
01:39:50,341 --> 01:39:52,841
We do protest.
By asking for money.

1317
01:39:55,549 --> 01:40:01,174
We killed the Father who knew the truth,
and Jessica who blurted the truth.

1318
01:40:01,633 --> 01:40:05,799
The minister wouldn't co-operate with us, so
we revealed the truth to his daughter-in-law.

1319
01:40:06,633 --> 01:40:09,299
What did she do?
She committed suicide.

1320
01:40:11,341 --> 01:40:15,299
Doctor, Jessica, the minister...
I get what they did wrong.

1321
01:40:16,216 --> 01:40:18,091
What wrong did my sister-in-law do?

1322
01:40:21,299 --> 01:40:23,883
You really need to know? Huh?

1323
01:40:34,716 --> 01:40:36,341
Hello?
Abhinaya?

1324
01:40:36,591 --> 01:40:37,942
Yes, who is this?

1325
01:40:37,966 --> 01:40:39,591
That's not important!

1326
01:40:40,091 --> 01:40:41,674
But you need to know something.

1327
01:40:41,883 --> 01:40:45,883
Hello, without knowing who you are,
I don't need to know anything from you!

1328
01:40:52,091 --> 01:40:53,317
Hello, what do you want?

1329
01:40:53,341 --> 01:40:54,942
There is no point in getting angry.

1330
01:40:54,966 --> 01:40:57,591
Soon you'll have a baby shower
and deliver a child.

1331
01:40:58,091 --> 01:40:59,341
Why so short tempered?

1332
01:40:59,549 --> 01:41:02,508
You're angry already?
Then wait till you hear this.

1333
01:41:02,841 --> 01:41:05,258
That child might be yours...

1334
01:41:05,383 --> 01:41:07,883
but it's definitely not your husband's.

1335
01:41:09,674 --> 01:41:11,841
Dr. Tulasi. Varam Hospital.

1336
01:41:12,049 --> 01:41:13,674
Artificial insemination.

1337
01:41:13,883 --> 01:41:16,508
You think only you and your husband
know about this.

1338
01:41:36,383 --> 01:41:37,258
No!

1339
01:41:39,591 --> 01:41:40,758
That's not true.

1340
01:41:40,883 --> 01:41:44,383
Ask the doctor who was lying to you all
this time. You'll know what the truth is!

1341
01:41:44,674 --> 01:41:46,966
That baby in your womb
isn't your husband's!

1342
01:41:47,174 --> 01:41:50,549
When the baby is born,
it might look like you.

1343
01:41:50,674 --> 01:41:52,484
But it won't look like your husband!

1344
01:41:52,508 --> 01:41:55,049
"Eyes like dad."
"Nose like dad."

1345
01:41:55,341 --> 01:41:58,258
You'll never find any resemblance
to say those things!

1346
01:42:06,466 --> 01:42:07,508
Doctor?

1347
01:42:08,424 --> 01:42:09,508
What is it?

1348
01:42:09,966 --> 01:42:11,091
Talk to me.

1349
01:42:12,466 --> 01:42:14,758
This child in my womb...
it's ours, right?

1350
01:42:17,091 --> 01:42:19,341
Why do you doubt that?
It is your baby!

1351
01:42:19,966 --> 01:42:21,216
I didn't mean that.

1352
01:42:21,841 --> 01:42:24,424
This baby belongs to
me and my husband, right?

1353
01:42:26,341 --> 01:42:27,299
I'm asking you!

1354
01:42:27,966 --> 01:42:29,258
Answer me, doctor.

1355
01:42:29,716 --> 01:42:30,591
Please.

1356
01:42:31,508 --> 01:42:34,216
Is my husband
the father of this child?

1357
01:42:34,674 --> 01:42:35,549
No.

1358
01:42:37,424 --> 01:42:41,174
The fetus was not formed using
your husband's sperm cells.

1359
01:42:42,883 --> 01:42:46,466
We used someone else's sperm cells
from the sperm bank.

1360
01:42:48,841 --> 01:42:53,674
Because your husband's sperm cells can't
be used to procreate.

1361
01:42:54,883 --> 01:42:57,484
Then why did you lie to us?

1362
01:42:57,508 --> 01:42:58,758
If I had told you...

1363
01:42:58,883 --> 01:43:02,466
Would you have agreed to undergo the
treatment using someone else's sperm cells?

1364
01:43:04,383 --> 01:43:07,966
Even if your family didn't know it,
would your husband have agreed to it?

1365
01:43:08,633 --> 01:43:10,883
What was the necessity to do this?

1366
01:43:15,758 --> 01:43:19,549
In today's situation,
the more you delay having a baby...

1367
01:43:19,841 --> 01:43:23,091
I've seen how the society looks at
a woman and her husband.

1368
01:43:23,341 --> 01:43:25,091
As a doctor, I know that too well.

1369
01:43:25,841 --> 01:43:27,549
I didn't want you to experience that.

1370
01:43:28,883 --> 01:43:30,591
I empathized as a mother.

1371
01:43:31,424 --> 01:43:32,508
Now, you tell me...

1372
01:43:32,799 --> 01:43:34,133
Did I do something wrong?

1373
01:43:37,758 --> 01:43:41,549
If you still feel it was wrong,
you can take action against me.

1374
01:43:46,424 --> 01:43:47,341
Look...

1375
01:43:47,841 --> 01:43:49,341
Even if isn't just for you,

1376
01:43:49,549 --> 01:43:53,466
At least for your husband's reputation
in the society, this has to be done.

1377
01:44:00,966 --> 01:44:02,299
What do you want now?

1378
01:44:02,591 --> 01:44:07,174
Your husband and his family think the
baby is their family's heir.

1379
01:44:07,966 --> 01:44:10,383
If they shouldn't know the truth,
we need a deal, right?

1380
01:44:10,883 --> 01:44:14,049
The cost of the deal is 5 million,
with no taxes deducted!

1381
01:44:15,883 --> 01:44:17,734
I don't have so much money.

1382
01:44:17,758 --> 01:44:20,258
You and your husband might
not have the money.

1383
01:44:20,716 --> 01:44:25,049
Your dad was a normal person,
but he's a big wig after winning this case.

1384
01:44:25,383 --> 01:44:28,400
He's inherited 40 million.
We're asking for just 25% of that.

1385
01:44:28,424 --> 01:44:30,882
He wouldn't give the money
if his daughter asks for it?

1386
01:44:30,883 --> 01:44:33,109
If you think about telling your husband
or the police...

1387
01:44:33,133 --> 01:44:36,484
You must have seen it on the TV
and newspapers a month back.

1388
01:44:36,508 --> 01:44:42,341
Like Jessica and the Father who died... you
and your husband will meet the same fate!

1389
01:44:42,466 --> 01:44:45,258
Not just that,
your happiness will be ruined.

1390
01:45:07,174 --> 01:45:09,633
I can't even concentrate
on work these days.

1391
01:45:09,966 --> 01:45:15,091
I'm busy making lists of baby names
for a boy or a girl.

1392
01:45:16,924 --> 01:45:18,299
What do you wish for?

1393
01:45:18,966 --> 01:45:20,633
A boy, or a girl?

1394
01:45:20,966 --> 01:45:24,674
I'm just happy that we're having a baby
after all these years.

1395
01:45:26,049 --> 01:45:26,883
Okay.

1396
01:45:27,341 --> 01:45:31,091
Let it be a boy or a girl...
forget about the name, too.

1397
01:45:31,633 --> 01:45:33,633
Guess the baby's initials.

1398
01:45:39,966 --> 01:45:40,883
A?

1399
01:45:41,299 --> 01:45:42,133
No!

1400
01:45:43,049 --> 01:45:44,424
A.S.

1401
01:45:44,841 --> 01:45:46,216
A for Aravind...

1402
01:45:46,466 --> 01:45:48,383
S for Sri Abhinaya.

1403
01:45:50,674 --> 01:45:54,466
A child isn't something
that only the dad can claim rights over!

1404
01:45:55,299 --> 01:45:59,258
You bear so much pain
just to give me the identity as a father.

1405
01:45:59,424 --> 01:46:01,299
I must give you this honour.

1406
01:46:31,466 --> 01:46:33,508
What a surprise, Abhi!
What is it?

1407
01:46:35,091 --> 01:46:37,258
Even the scans are due only next week.

1408
01:46:38,341 --> 01:46:40,633
I hope you're completely
clear and alright now.

1409
01:46:43,716 --> 01:46:45,299
Can you do something for me?

1410
01:46:45,841 --> 01:46:48,216
Of course.
I'm at your disposal.

1411
01:46:49,341 --> 01:46:50,966
I want an abortion, doctor.

1412
01:46:51,633 --> 01:46:52,716
What are you saying?

1413
01:46:53,174 --> 01:46:54,216
Yes, doctor.

1414
01:46:55,091 --> 01:46:57,150
I want to abort this baby.

1415
01:46:57,174 --> 01:46:58,883
This is your baby!
No.

1416
01:46:59,716 --> 01:47:00,883
This is not my baby.

1417
01:47:01,633 --> 01:47:03,799
If I ever have a baby...

1418
01:47:04,549 --> 01:47:06,883
it would only be my husband's.

1419
01:47:07,174 --> 01:47:10,383
For a woman,
being a mother is the most important thing.

1420
01:47:10,633 --> 01:47:11,966
I hope you'll understand that.

1421
01:47:12,466 --> 01:47:13,841
Being a mother is enough?

1422
01:47:15,383 --> 01:47:17,049
I need to be pure for him.

1423
01:47:17,883 --> 01:47:19,674
I want to be faithful to him.

1424
01:47:20,883 --> 01:47:22,275
That's enough for me.

1425
01:47:22,299 --> 01:47:23,716
You'll have an heir.

1426
01:47:23,883 --> 01:47:25,673
Your family tree will be cut off.

1427
01:47:25,674 --> 01:47:26,674
Enough, doctor.

1428
01:47:26,966 --> 01:47:29,383
Is this what you tell all your patients?

1429
01:47:29,966 --> 01:47:31,424
Having a baby isn't everything.

1430
01:47:32,133 --> 01:47:35,133
I don't know how he'd treat me,
if I don't have this baby.

1431
01:47:36,508 --> 01:47:38,508
But I'll take even better care of him.

1432
01:47:38,883 --> 01:47:41,383
We can do the abortion
only with your husband's permission.

1433
01:47:42,883 --> 01:47:45,133
Whose permission did you require
to do this to me?

1434
01:47:46,466 --> 01:47:48,674
I don't care what you tell him.

1435
01:47:49,883 --> 01:47:51,216
I don't want this.

1436
01:47:53,258 --> 01:47:55,091
If you want to save yourself...

1437
01:47:55,966 --> 01:47:57,299
do as I say.

1438
01:47:58,383 --> 01:48:00,883
All these years, I was yearning
to feel the contraction pains.

1439
01:48:01,674 --> 01:48:03,674
But I can't handle this pain.

1440
01:49:21,216 --> 01:49:22,424
How can I help you?

1441
01:49:22,591 --> 01:49:23,758
Is Aravind home?

1442
01:49:23,966 --> 01:49:26,174
He just left for the factory.
You are...?

1443
01:49:26,466 --> 01:49:28,883
My name is Guna.
I was his classmate in college.

1444
01:49:29,174 --> 01:49:30,966
He asked me to come home today.

1445
01:49:31,216 --> 01:49:32,674
He didn't mention anything.

1446
01:49:32,883 --> 01:49:34,383
Please wait...
Okay.

1447
01:49:44,841 --> 01:49:45,841
Who are you people?

1448
01:49:46,216 --> 01:49:47,924
Why are you coming inside?

1449
01:49:50,174 --> 01:49:51,109
Help!

1450
01:49:51,133 --> 01:49:52,383
Don't shout.

1451
01:49:54,549 --> 01:49:56,424
You couldn't recognize my voice?

1452
01:49:58,091 --> 01:49:59,966
You said we'll get the deal done.

1453
01:50:00,466 --> 01:50:03,758
So... We came here to
get everything done!

1454
01:50:15,133 --> 01:50:19,341
The second you said you didn't
want this baby, we knew it!

1455
01:50:19,883 --> 01:50:23,591
You'd tell on us any moment.

1456
01:50:24,508 --> 01:50:25,883
You're making a mistake.

1457
01:50:26,966 --> 01:50:28,716
I've made a mistake...

1458
01:50:29,508 --> 01:50:33,174
I didn't tell my husband or Vetri
about this.

1459
01:50:33,758 --> 01:50:35,299
We guessed as much.

1460
01:50:38,341 --> 01:50:39,966
Besides, that's a part of the thrill.

1461
01:50:45,258 --> 01:50:47,799
Since I'm emotional,
I'll give you one final chance.

1462
01:50:55,174 --> 01:50:56,383
John?
Talk to me.

1463
01:50:56,591 --> 01:50:58,133
She's being stubborn.

1464
01:50:58,591 --> 01:50:59,775
You should talk to her.

1465
01:50:59,799 --> 01:51:01,508
Turn the speaker on.
Okay.

1466
01:51:03,341 --> 01:51:04,549
Abhi, look...

1467
01:51:04,716 --> 01:51:07,758
Let's cancel the deal.
You don't have to give us any money.

1468
01:51:08,258 --> 01:51:11,299
But you mustn't harm the baby.

1469
01:51:11,674 --> 01:51:14,258
Your husband might not
be the baby's father...

1470
01:51:15,424 --> 01:51:16,883
but you're the mother, right?

1471
01:51:17,549 --> 01:51:22,216
You can live happily ever after -
you, your husband, your baby, your family.

1472
01:51:25,258 --> 01:51:27,049
Gaurav, give it a shot.

1473
01:51:27,174 --> 01:51:28,674
If she doesn't co-operate,
finish her.

1474
01:51:29,341 --> 01:51:30,299
Now, tell me!

1475
01:51:30,883 --> 01:51:32,799
Do you want the baby, or not?

1476
01:52:16,341 --> 01:52:17,341
Sir?

1477
01:52:18,049 --> 01:52:19,549
You just shot him?

1478
01:52:19,966 --> 01:52:21,549
He knew all the details.

1479
01:52:21,674 --> 01:52:23,275
You've killed the only evidence we had.

1480
01:52:23,299 --> 01:52:24,549
What evidence?

1481
01:52:25,383 --> 01:52:27,841
For the sake of evidence,
we're letting everyone slip by!

1482
01:52:28,341 --> 01:52:30,716
He's not of any use to us.
Let him die!

1483
01:52:48,966 --> 01:52:49,966
Sorry, sir.

1484
01:52:50,633 --> 01:52:54,216
When the officer was investigating him,
what's our duty?

1485
01:52:54,591 --> 01:52:57,109
We should have guarded the gun.
We were careless!

1486
01:52:57,133 --> 01:52:58,859
He took the gun and started shooting at us!

1487
01:52:58,883 --> 01:53:01,508
Thank god, the officer shot
him and saved our lives.

1488
01:53:02,508 --> 01:53:03,466
Thank you, sir.

1489
01:53:03,966 --> 01:53:06,049
Sir, it's been fully recorded.

1490
01:53:08,258 --> 01:53:10,216
'Fully' recorded, huh?
Yes, sir.

1491
01:53:10,383 --> 01:53:12,508
You fool!
You tell me now.

1492
01:53:12,966 --> 01:53:14,883
You just brought it straight
from the department?

1493
01:53:15,049 --> 01:53:19,174
You must check the condition of the
equipment, if the batteries are charged.

1494
01:53:19,591 --> 01:53:22,758
It needed to be serviced.
And you've brought it here!

1495
01:53:23,466 --> 01:53:25,841
Now... only half of it is on record!

1496
01:53:26,091 --> 01:53:28,633
Only till he was talking.
It didn't record when he shot at us!

1497
01:53:29,799 --> 01:53:30,758
Sorry, sir.

1498
01:53:30,966 --> 01:53:32,216
Useless fellows.

1499
01:53:32,674 --> 01:53:33,799
I am exit.

1500
01:53:39,216 --> 01:53:44,049
Sir, this system has details of all couples who
underwent artificial insemination at Varam Hospital.

1501
01:53:44,466 --> 01:53:46,317
Is this from the hospital's database?
Yes, sir.

1502
01:53:46,341 --> 01:53:47,859
Sir, not just that...

1503
01:53:47,883 --> 01:53:52,091
They have hacked into the databases of all
fertility hospitals in the city.

1504
01:53:58,591 --> 01:54:00,299
Yes, doctor?
Mr. Vetri...

1505
01:54:00,799 --> 01:54:03,758
We just got reports of the
DNA tests you'd requested.

1506
01:54:04,133 --> 01:54:08,758
The male DNA of the three deceased women's
fetus didn't belong to their husbands.

1507
01:54:09,633 --> 01:54:11,692
I know, doctor.
One more shocking news...

1508
01:54:11,716 --> 01:54:15,841
All three male DNAs belonged
to the same person.

1509
01:54:16,924 --> 01:54:19,633
Even if it's legal,
all three suffered unnatural deaths.

1510
01:54:20,549 --> 01:54:24,341
If we check with the doctor who treated them, or
the sperm bank that provided the sperm cells...

1511
01:54:24,633 --> 01:54:26,341
we'll know the details.

1512
01:54:46,466 --> 01:54:47,442
What's the name?

1513
01:54:47,466 --> 01:54:48,674
John Mathew, sir.

1514
01:54:48,841 --> 01:54:50,049
I meant your wife's name.

1515
01:54:50,549 --> 01:54:52,091
Sujitha, sir.
She's a doctor.

1516
01:54:52,216 --> 01:54:54,008
Wife's a doctor,
and you're a medical representative?

1517
01:54:54,133 --> 01:54:55,692
Must be a love marriage?

1518
01:54:55,716 --> 01:54:56,609
Yes, sir.

1519
01:54:56,633 --> 01:54:58,883
How long has she gone missing?
Last two days, sir.

1520
01:54:59,049 --> 01:55:01,609
First go file an F.I.R.
I'll take care of the rest.

1521
01:55:01,633 --> 01:55:04,549
Sir, please sir.
Just find her somehow.

1522
01:55:18,924 --> 01:55:21,133
Yes, artificial insemination.

1523
01:55:21,466 --> 01:55:24,424
As a doctor, I've done this for so
many people, with or without consent.

1524
01:55:24,966 --> 01:55:26,525
I must help myself, too.

1525
01:55:26,549 --> 01:55:28,966
Suji... I want a baby with you.

1526
01:55:29,966 --> 01:55:32,133
I want him to call me 'dad'.

1527
01:55:35,049 --> 01:55:37,192
Why would I want
to have a baby like 'you'?

1528
01:55:37,216 --> 01:55:40,424
I'll have the kind of child I want.

1529
01:55:40,549 --> 01:55:41,359
Got it?

1530
01:55:41,383 --> 01:55:44,674
You want me to be a slave
to the husband by having your baby?

1531
01:55:45,091 --> 01:55:49,758
I neither need a husband, nor do I have
to sleep with anyone else to have a baby.

1532
01:55:51,049 --> 01:55:54,275
I just need a stranger's 23 chromosomes.

1533
01:55:54,299 --> 01:55:55,383
No, Suji...

1534
01:55:56,966 --> 01:55:57,966
Don't do this.

1535
01:55:58,924 --> 01:56:00,883
I want 'our' baby.
No way.

1536
01:56:01,591 --> 01:56:02,591
Divorce me, then.

1537
01:56:03,216 --> 01:56:04,758
You can be the dad on record,
if you want.

1538
01:56:08,216 --> 01:56:09,466
I want to be a dad.

1539
01:56:10,716 --> 01:56:11,883
I want to be a dad.

1540
01:56:15,674 --> 01:56:18,508
Who are you to decide if
I should be a father or not?

1541
01:56:18,633 --> 01:56:20,174
You cheating scum!

1542
01:56:26,883 --> 01:56:32,383
Didn't I tell you?
Money is the starting point for all of us.

1543
01:56:32,716 --> 01:56:33,508
Hello.

1544
01:56:40,883 --> 01:56:42,758
I want to be a father.

1545
01:56:50,091 --> 01:56:51,692
The vision is now clear.

1546
01:56:51,716 --> 01:56:55,525
I need to know about the medical representatives
who supply fertility medicines to Varam Hospital.

1547
01:56:55,549 --> 01:56:56,317
Okay, sir.

1548
01:56:56,341 --> 01:56:57,716
Ravi...
Sir?

1549
01:56:58,841 --> 01:57:02,424
2009... on the eve of Christmas.
That's December 24th.

1550
01:57:02,716 --> 01:57:06,692
A guy called John Mathew came to R-6 police station
to register a case about his missing wife.

1551
01:57:06,716 --> 01:57:10,192
I need his address and full details
about his current occupation. Get it.

1552
01:57:10,216 --> 01:57:11,591
Sir!
Sir, what about you?

1553
01:57:12,424 --> 01:57:14,549
Varam Hospital. Dr. Tulasi.

1554
01:57:18,883 --> 01:57:21,383
For couples in the U.S.
who couldn't have kids...

1555
01:57:21,508 --> 01:57:25,674
I've treated so many patients successfully
using another person's sperm cells!

1556
01:57:26,466 --> 01:57:29,591
But here in India, all people think
about is 'my baby' and 'my heir'.

1557
01:57:30,341 --> 01:57:32,674
They're sentimental idiots
immersed in their culture.

1558
01:57:32,841 --> 01:57:35,192
They'll refuse to use
someone else's sperm cells.

1559
01:57:35,216 --> 01:57:37,567
Only ten out of hundred
will agree to it.

1560
01:57:37,591 --> 01:57:39,883
If we do this to ten people,
it isn't business.

1561
01:57:40,216 --> 01:57:42,508
When we do it to a hundred people,
that's business!

1562
01:57:43,466 --> 01:57:49,299
A fetus is formed when 23 chromosome
strands of a male fuse with a female's.

1563
01:57:49,424 --> 01:57:52,716
And choosing the 23 male
chromosome strands...

1564
01:57:53,424 --> 01:57:55,591
We get to decide that.

1565
01:57:55,758 --> 01:57:57,298
We are the gods!

1566
01:57:57,299 --> 01:57:59,424
And it's 'Operation 23'.

1567
01:58:00,008 --> 01:58:01,508
That's our business.

1568
01:58:01,674 --> 01:58:03,841
We've done this to so many people
over the years.

1569
01:58:04,341 --> 01:58:06,150
We've never had any problems.

1570
01:58:06,174 --> 01:58:08,400
But now three clients have died
because of you.

1571
01:58:08,424 --> 01:58:09,508
You have proof?

1572
01:58:11,591 --> 01:58:12,674
Send him in.

1573
01:58:16,466 --> 01:58:17,424
Yes, sir?

1574
01:58:18,674 --> 01:58:21,466
He's the assistant from the sperm bank.
You must know him!

1575
01:58:22,424 --> 01:58:25,215
Unknown to the patients,
we stored the sperm in Storage Number 23...

1576
01:58:25,216 --> 01:58:30,067
you swapped it with your sperm
illegally, in the place of our sperm,

1577
01:58:30,091 --> 01:58:32,091
and blackmailed them.

1578
01:58:32,841 --> 01:58:35,049
You've stolen the clients'
data through him.

1579
01:58:35,174 --> 01:58:37,817
Without our knowledge, you've
emotionally blackmailed the patients.

1580
01:58:37,841 --> 01:58:40,508
What we're doing is white-collar crime.

1581
01:58:40,716 --> 01:58:43,359
Don't get us exposed
because of your acts.

1582
01:58:43,383 --> 01:58:44,424
If I refuse?

1583
01:58:45,383 --> 01:58:47,841
There are so many excuses
in the medical field.

1584
01:58:48,133 --> 01:58:51,841
We know how to weave our way out of it.

1585
01:58:53,049 --> 01:58:55,341
If you're committing a
white-collar crime...

1586
01:58:55,841 --> 01:58:57,633
What I am about to commit...

1587
01:58:59,466 --> 01:59:01,091
is a red-collar crime!

1588
01:59:16,299 --> 01:59:18,716
Don't forget to bring the scan reports.
Okay.

1589
01:59:19,133 --> 01:59:20,525
I need to meet Dr. Tulasi.

1590
01:59:20,549 --> 01:59:23,067
She's in a meeting with the Dean.
Just wait here, sir.

1591
01:59:23,091 --> 01:59:24,049
Thank you.

1592
02:00:14,883 --> 02:00:20,216
Some doctors conduct illegal artificial insemination
treatments, and the code they use for that is...

1593
02:00:21,299 --> 02:00:22,049
Twenty three.

1594
02:00:22,299 --> 02:00:25,799
This team of blackmailers
use that to their leverage.

1595
02:00:26,049 --> 02:00:28,567
Money, money, money!
Money makes it all.

1596
02:00:28,591 --> 02:00:32,859
All that's fine, your sister-in-law,
Abhinaya, she died because of the blackmail?

1597
02:00:32,883 --> 02:00:33,817
No!

1598
02:00:33,841 --> 02:00:39,799
She was a regular middle-class woman driven by
the society's pressure to somehow have a baby...

1599
02:00:40,049 --> 02:00:45,591
which was misused by some doctors like you.
That's how Mrs. Abhinaya was killed.

1600
02:00:47,466 --> 02:00:48,216
Sorry, sir.

1601
02:00:48,341 --> 02:00:51,091
Don't blame the growth of medical science.

1602
02:00:53,091 --> 02:00:54,633
What's medical science?

1603
02:00:55,299 --> 02:00:59,091
If knowing the baby's gender before birth
is a medical science...

1604
02:00:59,466 --> 02:01:02,424
aborting the baby if it's a girl,
is that progress?

1605
02:01:02,924 --> 02:01:05,174
No!
It's a medical crime.

1606
02:01:06,383 --> 02:01:11,091
If the baby's birth is going to harm the
mother, getting it aborted is medical science.

1607
02:01:11,216 --> 02:01:17,341
But, when people get love and lust mixed
up, and get an abortion to save face?

1608
02:01:18,466 --> 02:01:20,174
It's a medical crime.

1609
02:01:20,341 --> 02:01:21,567
Similarly...

1610
02:01:21,591 --> 02:01:26,299
Legally having a baby through test tube or
injection methods... that's medical science.

1611
02:01:26,508 --> 02:01:28,966
But...
This is medical crime!

1612
02:01:33,216 --> 02:01:35,549
We look at doctors like gods.

1613
02:01:36,008 --> 02:01:38,341
Because they save lives.

1614
02:01:39,216 --> 02:01:40,966
Not because they kill lives.

1615
02:01:44,174 --> 02:01:47,091
If we need to know about
doctors operating illegally..

1616
02:01:47,216 --> 02:01:49,674
We need to catch the entire team
that blackmails the patients.

1617
02:01:49,841 --> 02:01:52,091
This is our evidence to lead to them.

1618
02:01:52,466 --> 02:01:54,192
All four of them are orphans.

1619
02:01:54,216 --> 02:01:58,174
They didn't just grow up at the same home,
they work together now.

1620
02:01:58,549 --> 02:02:01,216
These four people working at the medical
department are responsible for everything.

1621
02:02:10,799 --> 02:02:11,799
Excuse me, sir.

1622
02:02:12,674 --> 02:02:15,966
So Vetri, are you happy that
you're going to close the case?

1623
02:02:16,133 --> 02:02:17,883
You're almost near me.

1624
02:02:18,133 --> 02:02:20,692
If you don't want to get caught,
run away, John Matthew!

1625
02:02:20,716 --> 02:02:22,216
Don't try to catch me.

1626
02:02:22,591 --> 02:02:24,508
You lost your wife, didn't you?

1627
02:02:24,674 --> 02:02:26,650
She couldn't stand to live with you,
so she left.

1628
02:02:26,674 --> 02:02:30,150
I didn't lose my wife, Vetri...
I got rid of her!

1629
02:02:30,174 --> 02:02:31,841
Where are you?

1630
02:02:32,008 --> 02:02:34,758
First, you came after the doctor.
Now you're after me.

1631
02:02:34,966 --> 02:02:36,841
But did you see your wife at the hospital?

1632
02:02:37,299 --> 02:02:38,942
I mean your would-be, Thendral.

1633
02:02:38,966 --> 02:02:40,508
What do you mean?

1634
02:02:41,424 --> 02:02:43,359
Don't come after me,
and end up losing her!

1635
02:02:43,383 --> 02:02:45,317
I mean, she is slowly dying.

1636
02:02:45,341 --> 02:02:47,109
Where is she?

1637
02:02:47,133 --> 02:02:48,341
Twenty three!

1638
02:02:51,383 --> 02:02:52,216
Shit!

1639
02:03:12,924 --> 02:03:14,216
Twenty three!

1640
02:03:22,716 --> 02:03:23,924
Thendral!

1641
02:03:28,091 --> 02:03:29,383
Thendral!

1642
02:03:31,966 --> 02:03:32,924
Shit.

1643
02:03:37,716 --> 02:03:38,799
Thendral?

1644
02:03:41,716 --> 02:03:42,716
Thendral?

1645
02:03:42,924 --> 02:03:44,049
Thendral!

1646
02:04:03,924 --> 02:04:04,966
Thendral...

1647
02:05:48,799 --> 02:05:50,716
Hey! Take it easy, man!

1648
02:05:53,091 --> 02:05:54,383
Botulinium doxilin.

1649
02:05:54,799 --> 02:05:56,442
Slow and painless.

1650
02:05:56,466 --> 02:06:00,549
Attacks your respiratory system causing
paralysis, and eventually death.

1651
02:06:01,383 --> 02:06:03,508
As your pulse drops...

1652
02:06:06,591 --> 02:06:08,424
It's lights out, Vetri.

1653
02:06:22,091 --> 02:06:24,591
I'm not just medically trained, Vetri...

1654
02:06:25,008 --> 02:06:27,008
but also physically trained.

1655
02:07:22,091 --> 02:07:24,299
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

1656
02:07:41,216 --> 02:07:46,341
The moment I saw your sister-in-law at
Varam Hospital, I had decided right then.

1657
02:07:47,341 --> 02:07:52,091
That I'd be the father of the baby
that grows in her.

1658
02:07:53,424 --> 02:07:55,216
Only my friends wanted the money.

1659
02:07:56,091 --> 02:07:58,549
For me,
it was an emotional attachment.

1660
02:07:58,799 --> 02:08:00,383
Yes!

1661
02:08:00,674 --> 02:08:03,215
She decided to get an abortion suddenly...
just like that!

1662
02:08:03,216 --> 02:08:06,174
Who is she to kill my baby? Huh?

1663
02:08:06,383 --> 02:08:08,133
That's why I bloody killed her.

1664
02:09:03,049 --> 02:09:06,174
Every criminal has his own
justification for doing wrong.

1665
02:09:07,216 --> 02:09:10,049
But that does not mean
he's not guilty.

1666
02:09:10,799 --> 02:09:14,216
They say a woman is complete
only when she becomes a mother.

1667
02:09:15,133 --> 02:09:17,841
But there are so many people
in this world without kids.

1668
02:09:18,591 --> 02:09:24,091
To think they'd misuse a medical science
that could relieve them of their pain...

1669
02:09:24,508 --> 02:09:25,883
It's scary!

1670
02:09:26,841 --> 02:09:29,508
We talk about parents who don't have kids.

1671
02:09:29,966 --> 02:09:32,466
But there are so many kids without parents.

1672
02:09:32,966 --> 02:09:35,174
Do they have a medical solution?

1673
02:12:57,841 --> 02:13:00,049
Lottery.
