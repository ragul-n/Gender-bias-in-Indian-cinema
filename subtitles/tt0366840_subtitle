1
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:46,840
That's mine.

2
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,104
Leave them!

3
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,163
Hey! There's no way this side.
- We are stuck.

4
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,863
Cowards! Don't worry about them.

5
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,253
What's happening here?

6
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,598
This area has become
troublesome area.

7
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:55,434
We're discussing "together"
how to control it.

8
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,780
Is it the way to discuss?

9
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,114
Who beat you? Is it he?

10
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,791
No problem, tell me.

11
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,785
Is it him?

12
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,628
Come on, tell me. - No, sir.

13
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,294
That is...

14
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,964
He slipped and fell down. - Where?

15
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,636
Sir, that is...

16
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,134
Here!

17
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,142
Who fell down? Was it you or him?
- He only.

18
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,642
Where? - Here only.

19
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,146
Where? - Am I not saying him only?

20
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:40,815
I fell down here only.

21
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,981
Youngsters!

22
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,317
Playing games & little skirmishes
are quite common.

23
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,820
If you cross your limits.

24
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,997
I'll forget that I was once
a youngster like you.

25
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:52,664
Forget it sir!

26
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:53,490
Shut up!

27
00:11:35,337 --> 00:11:36,634
Today, we are going away.

28
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,136
Let's decide it in the game of
Kabaddi tomorrow.

29
00:11:43,011 --> 00:11:44,137
What can they do in a Kabaddi match?

30
00:11:44,346 --> 00:11:45,643
By the way, match is scheduled
tomorrow, isn't it?

31
00:11:45,848 --> 00:11:47,816
I think, it's better to start
practicing in the ground.

32
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:39,162
Writing exams again?

33
00:17:39,534 --> 00:17:41,661
I've to write again in September.

34
00:17:42,037 --> 00:17:43,664
Stop looking at me and
look into your books.

35
00:17:43,872 --> 00:17:44,998
You'll definitely pass.

36
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:46,833
Look into your books.

37
00:18:09,731 --> 00:18:10,698
Do you've any sense?

38
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:12,025
If I did, would I've been
born as your brother?

39
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:13,701
Can't you ever walk into
the house properly?

40
00:18:13,902 --> 00:18:15,369
This's my room, my will & wish.

41
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,698
Why're you dancing with a
group of monkeys?

42
00:18:20,242 --> 00:18:23,370
Are you calling us as monkeys?
We'll...

43
00:18:23,745 --> 00:18:28,375
Oh God! Will you scratch me?
I'm just a human.

44
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,208
Asha, will you take care of
your brother or shall we?

45
00:18:32,754 --> 00:18:33,721
What will you do?

46
00:18:34,256 --> 00:18:35,052
We'll pluck out your eye balls.

47
00:18:35,257 --> 00:18:36,383
We'll bite you.

48
00:18:36,591 --> 00:18:37,558
Will you take out lice
from my hairs also?

49
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:38,555
Get lost!

50
00:18:40,428 --> 00:18:42,555
What's all this dolls here?
What's going on here?

51
00:18:43,265 --> 00:18:44,232
Is it your room or mine?

52
00:18:44,432 --> 00:18:46,229
This is not your room.
This is my room.

53
00:18:46,434 --> 00:18:47,731
Dad has told me to use it.

54
00:18:47,936 --> 00:18:49,062
What will you use it?

55
00:18:49,437 --> 00:18:51,234
You're so young! Do you want a
separate room for yourself?

56
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:54,237
As night falls, you'll go next
to mother. Go out... go out!

57
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:57,077
We are not little girls!
Look, how big we are...

58
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:01,244
Oh, Asha, I had brought
something for you.

59
00:19:01,449 --> 00:19:02,575
What's it, brother?

60
00:19:05,287 --> 00:19:05,753
Take it... take it...

61
00:19:05,954 --> 00:19:08,081
Stop! We had stopped eating it,
when we were young.

62
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,587
If you want lick it yourself.

63
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,258
Come, let's dance.

64
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:17,928
That means, you'll not go out.
That's all, isn't it?

65
00:19:18,466 --> 00:19:22,766
I'll be very free in my room.

66
00:19:25,473 --> 00:19:26,440
Very free!

67
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,787
Looks like, he'll get down
to his birthday suit.

68
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:46,624
Wait!

69
00:19:47,162 --> 00:19:51,292
Mother, look, what brother is
doing there?

70
00:19:51,499 --> 00:19:53,296
Did you see, how he made my friends
to leave this place?

71
00:19:53,668 --> 00:19:54,965
I was hearing everything.

72
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,137
Can't you help me by
cutting onions?

73
00:19:56,338 --> 00:19:58,636
Oh God, lt'll give tears.
I'll not cut it.

74
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:00,474
If you don't practice now,

75
00:20:00,842 --> 00:20:02,469
You'll shed tears in your
In-law's place in future.

76
00:20:02,677 --> 00:20:04,474
Did you see how he's talking
to me, mother?

77
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,146
Are you accepting now that
you're a little girl?

78
00:20:07,515 --> 00:20:09,312
Lick this Lollipop!

79
00:20:10,518 --> 00:20:13,646
Oh mother! Why do you do
all this work?

80
00:20:13,855 --> 00:20:15,152
I'm your son as well as
your daughter.

81
00:20:15,357 --> 00:20:16,824
Give it to me, I'll cut it
for you. Give me.

82
00:20:18,026 --> 00:20:19,152
Learn it from him.

83
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:24,157
So, I'll be the remaining balance
for you finally.

84
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,169
Mother, balance made me
to remember...

85
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,496
What's your Bank balance?

86
00:20:29,871 --> 00:20:31,839
Rs.73,000! - If you take out
Rs.4000 from it?

87
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,166
Rs.69,000!

88
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:33,841
Did you see?

89
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:35,009
My mother is a great mathematician.

90
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,507
You're great in apple polishing.

91
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:39,347
So, mother! You're now going
to give me Rs.4000.

92
00:20:39,547 --> 00:20:40,844
When did I say that?

93
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:44,018
You had only said if you take 4000
from 73,000, it'll be 69,000.

94
00:20:44,386 --> 00:20:45,512
Why do you want Rs.4000?

95
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,187
I thought of giving you
Rs.500 from it.

96
00:20:47,555 --> 00:20:48,522
You said it just now, mother.

97
00:20:50,225 --> 00:20:50,691
Mother!

98
00:20:52,727 --> 00:20:53,853
Would you please put
your autograph here?

99
00:20:54,229 --> 00:20:56,026
Oh, have you brought the
cheque also?

100
00:21:00,235 --> 00:21:03,204
Keep an account of the expenses.
- I'm buying a ledger also.

101
00:21:07,242 --> 00:21:09,369
Shall we now continue with
preparations of crisps?

102
00:21:09,744 --> 00:21:12,042
Mother, you move away,
I'll prepare it.

103
00:21:13,081 --> 00:21:16,710
Come... come... come quickly.
Lollipop... hot... crisps are...

104
00:21:36,771 --> 00:21:38,898
Hot crisps! Would you like to try?

105
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,245
Stop!

106
00:21:53,455 --> 00:21:57,084
How many times do I've to warn you
not to get into trouble?

107
00:21:58,126 --> 00:21:59,252
Who involved in it unnecessarily?

108
00:21:59,461 --> 00:22:01,088
Do you know about the operations
of that Soda gang?

109
00:22:01,296 --> 00:22:02,593
We are here for that!

110
00:22:03,131 --> 00:22:05,429
Who are you to take Law into
your hands? Tell me!

111
00:22:05,967 --> 00:22:06,592
If you still can't hold yourself,

112
00:22:06,768 --> 00:22:10,067
Pass IPS first and then
show your poweres.

113
00:22:10,305 --> 00:22:12,102
Jobs can't be secured only
by studying well.

114
00:22:12,307 --> 00:22:13,774
It can be secured in
sports quota also.

115
00:22:13,975 --> 00:22:15,602
Atleast, are you sincere in that?

116
00:22:16,144 --> 00:22:18,442
You're spending most of the time
in street brawls.

117
00:22:18,813 --> 00:22:19,939
Are you showing any interest
to go to the ground?

118
00:22:20,315 --> 00:22:21,782
You go on scold him like this only.

119
00:22:22,317 --> 00:22:24,785
Someday, he'll become a great man.
- When?

120
00:22:25,987 --> 00:22:27,784
When will that day come?

121
00:22:28,656 --> 00:22:30,783
Old millennium gave way
to the new millennium.

122
00:22:33,328 --> 00:22:34,124
Home made crisps are excellent.

123
00:22:34,329 --> 00:22:35,455
Is it really that good?

124
00:22:36,664 --> 00:22:37,790
Do you've to praise so much?

125
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,128
I'll praise any job done good.

126
00:22:41,503 --> 00:22:43,130
Your mother prepared it nicely,
so I complimented her.

127
00:22:43,338 --> 00:22:44,305
I had prepared it.

128
00:22:44,506 --> 00:22:47,134
If you don't get any job...

129
00:22:47,342 --> 00:22:49,469
Are you thinking of making a
living out of this?

130
00:22:49,844 --> 00:22:50,811
Superb idea, daddy.

131
00:22:51,012 --> 00:22:52,809
Go and study.

132
00:22:57,018 --> 00:22:59,486
I pity you, mother. - Why?

133
00:23:00,021 --> 00:23:01,488
We went to the bank day
before yesterday.

134
00:23:02,023 --> 00:23:02,819
You went, so what?

135
00:23:03,191 --> 00:23:04,658
Laughing and cracking jokes.

136
00:23:05,026 --> 00:23:05,492
With whom?

137
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:06,819
Who else, mother.

138
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:13,501
Who's that girl? - Which girl?

139
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:14,994
Where?

140
00:23:15,203 --> 00:23:15,669
Will you give me the crisps?

141
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,998
Don't act too smart?

142
00:23:19,707 --> 00:23:21,174
What happened in the bank?

143
00:23:22,043 --> 00:23:25,171
We withdrew cash.
- Oh! Is it the cashier?

144
00:23:25,713 --> 00:23:26,680
How much did you give?

145
00:23:27,882 --> 00:23:28,678
I withdrew the cash.

146
00:23:28,883 --> 00:23:29,850
Have crisps, father.

147
00:23:31,886 --> 00:23:34,855
You can eat later.
First, tell me about her.

148
00:23:37,058 --> 00:23:38,525
I've a match tomorrow.
I've to practice for that.

149
00:23:40,562 --> 00:23:43,360
You dress up & go out
to do this stuff?

150
00:23:44,198 --> 00:23:45,358
It's not that? - Then, what?

151
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:48,536
I must know who she's by today.
- Listen to me, Vasundhara.

152
00:23:50,905 --> 00:23:51,701
What happened was...

153
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,699

He didn't touch me.

167
00:24:56,471 --> 00:24:56,994
I did.

168
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:01,934
Don't lie.

169
00:25:19,661 --> 00:25:23,461
Ajay has started the raid.
And is raiding the defenders.

170

00:26:53,921 --> 00:26:57,049
The only player left in
Golconda team is captain Feroz.

177
00:26:57,258 --> 00:26:58,555
He is about to start the raid.

178
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,729
He's going determined
to win this game!

179
00:27:25,453 --> 00:27:27,421
Charminar team which has
won the semi-final.

180
00:27:27,955 --> 00:27:31,254
Will play in the final match
at Kurnool on 5th.

181
00:27:41,135 --> 00:27:43,262
Let me help you.
- It's alright. I can manage.

182
00:27:45,139 --> 00:27:47,767
Ajay, this is a wonderful
opportunity for you.

183
00:27:48,643 --> 00:27:51,271
All higher officials of my
department are coming there.

184
00:27:51,979 --> 00:27:53,708
They're in the recruitment
board too.

185
00:27:54,649 --> 00:27:56,276
You must play well & turn their
attention towards you.

186
00:27:57,819 --> 00:28:00,447
She wanted you to become
my senior officer.

187
00:28:01,155 --> 00:28:02,122
You must make her dream come true.

188
00:28:08,496 --> 00:28:08,962
Have it.

189
00:28:10,598 --> 00:28:11,292
Take this money.

190
00:28:14,001 --> 00:28:15,798
So, you didn't withdraw
cash for me.

191
00:28:17,338 --> 00:28:18,362
Did you go to bank again?

192
00:28:19,006 --> 00:28:20,735
When you come inside,
I'll teach you a lesson.

193
00:28:21,175 --> 00:28:21,971
You go.

194
00:28:22,176 --> 00:28:23,973
There're snacks in this box. Eat.

195
00:28:24,178 --> 00:28:25,145
I don't want any snacks.

196
00:28:25,513 --> 00:28:27,140
I don't know how to
spend this Rs.100.

197
00:28:27,682 --> 00:28:30,150
I brought it from Lakshmi's
(Goddess of money) place.

198
00:28:30,885 --> 00:28:32,978
Why do you compel him?
Give it to me.

199
00:28:33,287 --> 00:28:34,481
You keep quiet.
This is for him.

200
00:28:35,022 --> 00:28:35,488
Take a look.

201
00:28:36,524 --> 00:28:37,388
These snacks?

202
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:38,490
Why didn't you tell me?

203
00:28:38,693 --> 00:28:39,819
I like this very much.

204
00:28:40,027 --> 00:28:41,153
It's time to leave. Bye.

205
00:29:20,902 --> 00:29:22,233
Hey, where's my suitcase?

206
00:29:22,436 --> 00:29:24,870
It's in safe hands.
- I'm here to lift it for you.

207
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:26,866
Have all our boys got down?
Let's go.

208
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:30,036
Where's Kumar?
- Perhaps, he won't come back.

209
00:29:30,244 --> 00:29:31,711
He has trapped a girl
during the journey.

210
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:32,875
There he comes.

211
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:35,378
What happened? Okay?

212
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,548
Ajay, superb chick.
- Has she fallen into your trap?

213
00:29:39,587 --> 00:29:40,383
Here's her address.

214
00:29:40,755 --> 00:29:42,552
Keep watching.
- He's lucky.

215
00:29:43,658 --> 00:29:46,388
Boy, this is Kurnool.
Be careful.

216
00:29:46,594 --> 00:29:48,562
Let's go boys. - It's mine.

217
00:29:57,271 --> 00:29:58,067
He's here.

218
00:32:23,084 --> 00:32:24,881
Didn't I tell you,
this is Kurnool.

219
00:32:25,086 --> 00:32:25,780
This is very common here.

220
00:32:26,087 --> 00:32:27,384
Let's go...

221
00:36:36,503 --> 00:36:36,969
What's it?

222
00:36:38,172 --> 00:36:40,470
Twist... twist.

223
00:36:41,342 --> 00:36:41,808
Good.

224
00:36:49,016 --> 00:36:50,643
Feeling shy?

225
00:36:54,021 --> 00:36:55,818
The exams are nearing.

226
00:36:56,023 --> 00:36:57,820
I don't know how am I going
to prepare? - Yes.

227
00:37:02,196 --> 00:37:02,821
Swapna...

228
00:37:04,365 --> 00:37:07,163
Swapna, let's go home.
- What happened?

229
00:37:07,368 --> 00:37:08,665
Quick. Let's go.

230
00:37:09,036 --> 00:37:10,003
Has something happened
to my father?

231
00:37:10,704 --> 00:37:13,002
Obul Reddy has killed
your brother.

232
00:37:30,724 --> 00:37:32,692
Don't cry. Have some water.

233
00:37:46,907 --> 00:37:49,535
Have you informed Suresh?
- I did.

234
00:37:50,744 --> 00:37:52,109
He respects him very much.

235
00:37:53,247 --> 00:37:55,215
They studied together
till 10th std.

236
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,548
Everything must be performed
as per our customs.

237
00:38:00,421 --> 00:38:03,049
Has the washerman come? - Yes, he has.
- Make it fast?

238
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:11,888
Hey, your brother has come.

239
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:13,566
Get up... get up.

240
00:38:14,468 --> 00:38:18,234
You wanted your brother and
sister to study well.

241
00:38:18,439 --> 00:38:19,736
There he is.
Look at him.

242
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,737
Your engineer brother has come.
Get up.

243
00:38:22,042 --> 00:38:22,565
Get up.

244
00:38:29,116 --> 00:38:31,243
Look at your brother...

245
00:38:32,786 --> 00:38:37,086
He should've lit my pyre.

246
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:42,425
But the fate has made me
to lit his pyre.

247
00:39:25,005 --> 00:39:25,471
Hit me.

248
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,306
Hit me.

249
00:39:28,342 --> 00:39:29,309
Hit me, I say.

250
00:39:50,464 --> 00:39:52,159
This is knwon as
Martial Art "Varmakala".

251
00:39:52,866 --> 00:39:57,166
If I hit you on your nerves.
You must scream like hell.

252
00:39:57,371 --> 00:39:58,338
You bloody bugger!

253
00:40:02,543 --> 00:40:03,510
Hi! Nephew.

254
00:40:05,712 --> 00:40:09,341
Why're your eyes so red
like chillie?

255
00:40:10,217 --> 00:40:11,514
Did you cry on your
brothers' death?

256
00:40:12,586 --> 00:40:14,850
Or are you angry with me?

257
00:40:17,057 --> 00:40:18,422
I can understand your sorrows.

258
00:40:19,393 --> 00:40:20,519
Get buttermilk for my nephew.

259
00:40:21,228 --> 00:40:23,594
Add a hint of lime.
It'll cool his body.

260
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,088
What did I do?

261
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,863
I didn't ask for palaces.

262
00:40:28,235 --> 00:40:29,566
I invited him.

263
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,537
He spat on my face in public.

264
00:40:31,905 --> 00:40:37,036
Am I a piglet?
I'm son of Rayalaseema pride.

265
00:40:39,413 --> 00:40:41,040
I chased him & killed him.

266
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,547
Come and have butter milk.

267
00:42:21,348 --> 00:42:22,144
Mother, let's go this way.

268
00:42:27,521 --> 00:42:28,215
What's this?

269
00:42:29,356 --> 00:42:30,323
It's in the size of a Onion.

270
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:35,155
It must be bigger size that can
blast even Allagadda to pieces.

271
00:42:35,362 --> 00:42:37,227
Hey, should she have to teach
you everything?

272
00:42:37,531 --> 00:42:38,429
Make big bombs.

273
00:42:38,865 --> 00:42:39,661
Mother, let's go.

274
00:42:43,203 --> 00:42:43,669
Greetings, madam.

275
00:42:45,372 --> 00:42:45,997
Greetings, madam.

276
00:42:47,207 --> 00:42:48,834
Bulli, come on... move.

277
00:42:49,876 --> 00:42:51,673
Hey, make it fast.

278
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,505
All of you get in.

279
00:43:12,899 --> 00:43:13,365
Greetings.

280
00:43:14,401 --> 00:43:15,197
Greetings... Please sit down.

281
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:20,535
Hey, come here.

282
00:43:21,408 --> 00:43:23,535
This is for your, elder brother-in-law.

283
00:43:25,745 --> 00:43:27,372
This is for your, younger brother-in-law.

284
00:43:28,582 --> 00:43:29,378
Forgive me.

285
00:43:34,087 --> 00:43:35,213
Uncle, where's Swapna?

286
00:43:41,928 --> 00:43:44,396
Sit down... sit down.

287
00:43:50,604 --> 00:43:52,731
I killed 20 people by planting
a bomb in a car.

288
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,565
When I knew that our enemies
were travelling by bus.

289
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,242
I burnt the bus.

290
00:43:58,044 --> 00:44:00,979
Land deal problems, property problems.
Problems at the time of elections,

291
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:03,749
There're about 30-40 cases
filed on me.

292
00:44:04,618 --> 00:44:06,415
But, no witnesses for any crime.

293
00:44:07,287 --> 00:44:09,653
Who can dare to testify against me?

294
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,417
You should've heard about
my manliness.

295
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:17,920
If I wish, I had neither left a widow
nor a new born baby's mother.

296
00:44:19,132 --> 00:44:23,091
I've touched almost all women,
whom I like in this area.

297
00:44:23,637 --> 00:44:26,435
But, had I ever touched you?

298
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,106
I didn't.

299
00:44:27,474 --> 00:44:28,099
Do you know, why?

300
00:44:32,145 --> 00:44:34,272
I was waiting for you to mature.

301
00:44:34,981 --> 00:44:36,107
You come into my dreams.

302
00:44:36,816 --> 00:44:38,613
You make me cry & laugh.

303
00:44:39,152 --> 00:44:40,278
You're my queen.

304
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,288
You're the queen of my house & fort.

305
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:47,118
If anyone tries to stop our marriage.
He'll die.

306
00:44:47,327 --> 00:44:51,127
Hey kid, she is a little girl.
She's feeling shy.

307
00:44:51,498 --> 00:44:53,898
I'm an elderly person, I'm here.
I'll talk to them.

308
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:56,963
Look, Dasaratharama Reddy.

309
00:44:57,837 --> 00:44:58,963
We must come out from our sorrows.

310
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,467
Can you get back your
sons by crying?

311
00:45:03,677 --> 00:45:05,804
My son says he loves your daughter.

312
00:45:06,346 --> 00:45:07,472
He wants to marry her.

313
00:45:08,181 --> 00:45:09,978
Since we belong to the same caste,
I agreed.

314
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:14,308
Your son told my son is 15 yrs. Older
and marriage can't be performed.

315
00:45:14,521 --> 00:45:16,489
Can he put such a question
to my son?

316
00:45:16,856 --> 00:45:19,154
Isn't there 15 years age difference
between me & my husband?

317
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:20,986
Didn't we have children or
didn't I give birth to them?

318
00:45:22,529 --> 00:45:24,497
Look, it's said that, in the house
where a death has occurred,

319
00:45:24,698 --> 00:45:26,097
An auspicious function
should be performed.

320
00:45:27,033 --> 00:45:27,829
If marriage is conducted,

321
00:45:28,201 --> 00:45:30,499
My son will be both son &
son-in-law to this house.

322
00:45:32,706 --> 00:45:34,071
We'll fix the alliance.

323
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:37,035
If you've any relatives,
invite them.

324
00:45:39,546 --> 00:45:41,411
Come on, my son.

325
00:45:42,882 --> 00:45:43,610
Bye.

326
00:46:23,757 --> 00:46:25,725
I'll marry Obul Reddy, father.

327
00:46:29,429 --> 00:46:30,225
Don't stop me.

328
00:46:31,431 --> 00:46:33,058
Let me do this atleast now.

329
00:46:33,767 --> 00:46:35,132
If I had done this earlier,

330
00:46:36,603 --> 00:46:38,070
My brothers would've been alive.

331
00:46:38,438 --> 00:46:40,065
We've lost our 2 sons.

332
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,669
Are you telling us this
as good news?

333
00:46:43,209 --> 00:46:46,906
Father, you've not accepted
many things in life.

334
00:46:48,448 --> 00:46:50,416
My elder brother wanted to study.

335
00:46:50,884 --> 00:46:52,408
Didn't you stop his studies
for the sake of us?

336
00:46:53,286 --> 00:46:58,417
Didn't my mother quit the job to
stay close to her children?

337
00:46:59,292 --> 00:47:01,260
You did these things against
your liking.

338
00:47:02,462 --> 00:47:05,431
What's wrong in marrying,
though I don't like it?

339
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,429
To get rid of fear & sorrows.

340
00:47:11,137 --> 00:47:12,764
There's no way other
than this, father.

341
00:47:12,972 --> 00:47:16,271
Instead of that it's better we die.
- Mother.

342
00:47:16,476 --> 00:47:18,603
I can't hand you over
to that scoundrel.

343
00:47:19,312 --> 00:47:22,611
If you want us to be happy,
do as I say.

344
00:47:23,483 --> 00:47:28,182
I withdrew this money from
my P. F for your marriage.

345
00:47:28,488 --> 00:47:29,955
I've also got your certificates.

346
00:47:30,323 --> 00:47:31,790
Take them & go for away from us.

347
00:47:32,659 --> 00:47:34,126
But, where father?

348
00:47:34,828 --> 00:47:35,294
Look...

349
00:47:35,662 --> 00:47:39,462
Look, how many letters your uncle had
written from America for you?

350
00:47:39,699 --> 00:47:41,166
He has written that you're
studying well and...

351
00:47:41,501 --> 00:47:44,470
You're the cleverest of all and
he wanted us to send you there.

352
00:47:45,171 --> 00:47:46,798
Since, I didn't like to
send you so far away.

353
00:47:47,106 --> 00:47:48,801
I had hidden these letters
from you in the bureau.

354
00:47:49,175 --> 00:47:50,972
Go... go to your uncle's place.

355
00:47:51,344 --> 00:47:54,472
Let's live with a hope that you're
atleast alive. - Father.

356
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:56,139
How can I leave you...

357
00:47:56,516 --> 00:47:58,484
I've taken this decision
after a deep thought.

358
00:47:58,685 --> 00:48:00,744
There's no other way go.

359
00:48:01,454 --> 00:48:03,649
Every morning, Sun enters into
every one's life.

360
00:48:03,857 --> 00:48:06,325
But that scoundrel will
enter our lives.

361
00:48:06,526 --> 00:48:08,153
Go... go... - No. Father.

362
00:48:08,361 --> 00:48:09,157
Don't say a word.

363
00:48:09,696 --> 00:48:12,995
If everything goes well,
we'll come there.

364
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:18,159
Go... go... go...

365
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,729
What're you doing there?
- Unload the goods.

366
00:49:54,634 --> 00:49:57,262
Swapna, stop. Is anyone here?

367
00:50:24,163 --> 00:50:24,788
What's this?

368
00:50:25,498 --> 00:50:26,726
Why're you running away like this?

369
00:50:27,166 --> 00:50:28,463
What'll happen to me?

370
00:50:29,168 --> 00:50:36,472
I dreamt that we got married & your
brothers are reborn as our sons.

371
00:50:37,343 --> 00:50:39,971
Come... Why've you hung down
your heads?

372
00:50:43,182 --> 00:50:45,241
Do you feel shy to
look into my eyes?

373
00:50:45,518 --> 00:50:46,917
Then, look into my heart.

374
00:50:49,956 --> 00:50:50,479
It's true.

375
00:50:52,358 --> 00:50:54,485
Hereafter, don't cry. Come.

376
00:50:56,863 --> 00:50:57,488
Come.

377
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:00,995
Come...

378
00:51:11,377 --> 00:51:12,173
Thank you.

379
00:51:12,712 --> 00:51:15,738
Mother, brother is on
line from Kurnool.

380
00:51:15,982 --> 00:51:16,846
Will you talk to our mother?

381
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:19,280
There is not much time left.
The match will start in few minutes.

382
00:51:19,485 --> 00:51:22,079
Inform mother that I'll leave by
evening, okay? - Okay... Okay.

383
00:51:22,889 --> 00:51:24,754
I'm buying lollipops for you.
I won't forget.

384
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:37,528
He has hit Obul Reddy at Konda Reddy
bridge in broad day light.

385
00:52:37,964 --> 00:52:38,589
Who's he?

386
00:52:38,965 --> 00:52:41,263
He's definitely not from Kurnool.

387
00:52:52,311 --> 00:52:56,771
They're here. His henchman are
here, they'll.

388
00:53:01,154 --> 00:53:01,779
Start...

389
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,147
Where do you want to go?

390
00:53:29,849 --> 00:53:30,474
Don't know.

391
00:53:37,356 --> 00:53:38,152
They're coming.

392
00:53:51,704 --> 00:53:53,501
Hey, search in the bushes.

393
00:56:52,385 --> 00:56:55,616
Search in the farm.
- Make ripples in the water.

394
00:57:30,256 --> 00:57:31,723
They're over there.
Catch them.

395
00:58:23,309 --> 00:58:24,708
Search them here...

396
00:58:31,317 --> 00:58:36,949
Don't risk your life for me.
Go away.

397
00:58:38,591 --> 00:58:42,789
They're demons.
They'll kill you.

398
00:58:44,497 --> 00:58:46,624
I'll consider it as my fate.

399
00:58:49,502 --> 00:58:50,400
Go away.

400
00:59:00,513 --> 00:59:03,539
It's not manliness to run before
the war is over.

401
00:59:05,351 --> 00:59:07,319
I came to your place
to play Kabaddi.

402
00:59:08,354 --> 00:59:09,321
But now, I've come to know that.

403
00:59:10,356 --> 00:59:12,415
I should play here and
not on the ground.

404
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:27,686
Who're you?

405
01:02:31,223 --> 01:02:32,850
It's wrong... it's wrong.

406
01:02:34,059 --> 01:02:36,857
You rob 1 crore from me.
I can earn it again.

407
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:40,858
Take 10 kg gold.
I'll buy it again.

408
01:02:44,069 --> 01:02:45,866
How can you take my heart?

409
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:51,771
Hey, She's my heart... Life... Wife
...My darling.

410
01:02:52,344 --> 01:02:53,106
I love...

411
01:02:54,913 --> 01:02:56,039
If Swapna...

412
01:02:57,916 --> 01:02:59,543
If Swapna is lightning,
I'm the thunder.

413
01:03:00,853 --> 01:03:05,222
If Swapna is festival design,
I'm the flower on it.

414
01:03:06,425 --> 01:03:09,053
Like an ox stamping the flower.

415
01:03:09,428 --> 01:03:11,726
Will you dare to stamp my heart?

416
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:16,057
How dare you hit me at Konda Reddy Burge
centre in Kurnool?

417
01:03:17,102 --> 01:03:18,899
I won't kill you normally.

418
01:03:19,438 --> 01:03:23,238
I'll shred you to pieces & consecrate
our love with your blood.

419
01:03:23,442 --> 01:03:28,072
Cut any part of his body
which you want.

420
01:03:32,785 --> 01:03:36,243
Go back... go back.

421
01:03:39,458 --> 01:03:42,427
I don't know whether the life of the
black magician is in the parrot or not.

422
01:03:43,395 --> 01:03:45,158
I know that your life is in her.

423
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:51,759
As your life is important to you,
my life is more important to me.

424
01:03:53,472 --> 01:03:54,939
No... no...

425
01:03:55,974 --> 01:03:57,601
I can't bear if Swapna gets hurt.

426
01:03:58,076 --> 01:03:59,600
Ask anything you want.
I'll give you.

427
01:03:59,812 --> 01:04:01,609
But... no... no...

428
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:04,112
Hey, come here.

429
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:05,616
Come.

430
01:04:05,984 --> 01:04:07,952
Come here... - He has come.

431
01:04:08,821 --> 01:04:11,119
Remove your dhoti. Remove it.

432
01:04:11,323 --> 01:04:15,726
Hey remove it... he has removed it...

433
01:04:16,328 --> 01:04:19,297
Leave her. He has removed it.
- Spread it.

434
01:04:20,332 --> 01:04:24,132
Throw all your sickles over here.
Throw them all.

435
01:04:24,336 --> 01:04:30,297
Throw them all...
They've thrown them all.

436
01:04:32,344 --> 01:04:34,642
Pack them...

437
01:04:35,981 --> 01:04:43,786
I've packed them.
Leave her... Blood... Leave her.

438
01:04:44,356 --> 01:04:47,325
Hey, You come here... come here.

439
01:04:47,693 --> 01:04:49,490
Come here, he has come.

440
01:04:49,695 --> 01:04:51,162
Throw this into that Gypsy.

441
01:04:51,697 --> 01:04:53,824
Except that, deflate all
other vehicles.

442
01:04:56,702 --> 01:05:02,334
Go, take away. Go... & deflate
all vehicles, deflate.

443
01:05:06,712 --> 01:05:08,339
They've thrown the sickles.

444
01:05:08,747 --> 01:05:09,679
They've deflated all vehicles.

445
01:05:09,882 --> 01:05:11,509
Leave her... leave her.

446
01:05:15,721 --> 01:05:16,915
You go & sit in the Gypsy.

447
01:05:30,235 --> 01:05:32,032
Take the knife... Take it...

448
01:10:43,715 --> 01:10:44,181
Get in.

449
01:10:45,016 --> 01:10:46,142
Where else should I phone up?

450
01:10:47,052 --> 01:10:48,519
He's neither in relatives' house
nor in friends' house.

451
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:49,516
It's okay. Get down.

452
01:10:49,721 --> 01:10:52,690
I told him that if he wins
this match.

453
01:10:52,891 --> 01:10:53,858
His life will change.
Did he listen to us?

454
01:10:54,559 --> 01:10:56,527
He didn't go to the match at all.

455
01:10:57,229 --> 01:11:01,029
Where's your son? We thought of
honouring his talent...

456
01:11:01,233 --> 01:11:05,294
We thought of giving him
a chance to...

457
01:11:12,244 --> 01:11:12,869
That's my father.

458
01:11:14,079 --> 01:11:14,704
It's about me.

459
01:11:14,913 --> 01:11:17,711
Oh God! Since he was going
to play kabaddi.

460
01:11:17,916 --> 01:11:21,374
I gave him money for
pocket expenses.

461
01:11:21,586 --> 01:11:24,555
That's my mother. She is very good.
Wash your face.

462
01:11:24,756 --> 01:11:27,554
You've made him fit for nothing
by giving money.

463
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:31,229
If we are lenient, he'll complaint
about others.

464
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:34,398
You believe whatever he says
and support him.

465
01:11:34,933 --> 01:11:36,901
Do you know what he had told
to that girl in the bank?

466
01:11:37,435 --> 01:11:40,404
It seems he said "my father is
unable to forget you"

467
01:11:40,772 --> 01:11:43,570
She called me up &
expressed her grief.

468
01:11:44,276 --> 01:11:47,734
She said "sorry sir,
I can't cheat my husband"

469
01:11:49,614 --> 01:11:51,081
Not just one headache...

470
01:11:51,616 --> 01:11:53,243
For him to win the match.

471
01:11:53,952 --> 01:11:58,412
I even went to temple
& prayed for him.

472
01:12:01,626 --> 01:12:05,756
Look Vasundhara, don't stop me today.

473
01:12:06,298 --> 01:12:10,428
Yes daddy. Don't spare him today.
He has become a big headache for me.

474
01:12:10,635 --> 01:12:14,264
No one will react so silly in
one's career related matter.

475
01:12:14,472 --> 01:12:16,940
She's my sister.
Very dangerous.

476
01:12:17,142 --> 01:12:18,166
Let me see what excuse, he'll give.

477
01:12:18,476 --> 01:12:19,773
Let him give any excuse.
I'll not forgive him.

478
01:12:19,978 --> 01:12:21,104
Is anything more important
than his career?

479
01:12:21,313 --> 01:12:23,440
Let him come.
He's finished today.

480
01:12:23,648 --> 01:12:24,444
Do you want it?

481
01:12:32,657 --> 01:12:35,888
I'll go & show my face to them.
You be here itself.

482
01:13:01,686 --> 01:13:04,484
Beat me... Beat me...

483
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:07,658
If any one comes back from a
tournament without playing.

484
01:13:07,859 --> 01:13:09,986
Any father will get angry,
not only you.

485
01:13:10,195 --> 01:13:12,163
Beat me, father!
Beat me black & blue.

486
01:13:14,032 --> 01:13:16,500
You didn't beat me, when I threw
away my S.S.L. C marks list.

487
01:13:17,035 --> 01:13:20,334
You didn't beat me when I faked fever &
didn't attend intermediate exams.

488
01:13:20,872 --> 01:13:23,340
Before mother asks if you had done it
earlier, would he have become like this.

489
01:13:23,541 --> 01:13:24,667
Beat me, father. Beat me!

490
01:13:25,043 --> 01:13:26,840
Stop this overacting.

491
01:13:27,045 --> 01:13:28,342
Why are you hurt?

492
01:13:28,713 --> 01:13:31,011
Giving up the match. Did you unnecessarily
get involved in some trouble?

493
01:13:31,383 --> 01:13:33,351
No! I had practiced
little too much.

494
01:13:33,885 --> 01:13:35,512
Practicing for a never playing match.

495
01:13:36,054 --> 01:13:37,521
It's not time to joke, Asha.

496
01:13:40,892 --> 01:13:43,690
Really, fathers have great expectations
from their sons.

497
01:13:44,396 --> 01:13:47,024
Father who never visits temple
would've prayed for me.

498
01:13:48,233 --> 01:13:51,361
How's that? You're repeating
father's words perfectly.

499
01:13:52,070 --> 01:13:53,537
Only a son can understand
a father's heart.

500
01:13:53,738 --> 01:13:54,705
How can a daughter understand it?

501
01:13:54,906 --> 01:13:56,032
They grow up under him for 18 years.

502
01:13:56,241 --> 01:13:58,038
After that they'll marry and
go to their In-law's place.

503
01:13:58,243 --> 01:13:59,039
That's what you do, don't you?

504
01:13:59,244 --> 01:14:00,711
Why're you getting angry on me
after not playing a match?

505
01:14:00,912 --> 01:14:02,709
Am I a fool to come back without
playing the match?

506
01:14:03,081 --> 01:14:07,040
I knew after reaching Kurnool that
this will decide my Nationals fate

507
01:14:07,252 --> 01:14:10,050
But I told you to tell this to father,
when I wished you on your birthday.

508
01:14:10,255 --> 01:14:10,721
Didn't you tell him?

509
01:14:11,089 --> 01:14:12,215
When did you tell me?

510
01:14:12,757 --> 01:14:14,384
You might have forgotten in your
birthday party.

511
01:14:15,593 --> 01:14:16,753
Okay, let bygones be bygones.

512
01:14:17,929 --> 01:14:21,057
Father, this time I'll definitely
win National Cup.

513
01:14:21,266 --> 01:14:22,062
I promise on Asha.

514
01:14:22,267 --> 01:14:24,895
I don't have faith in you.
Don't promise on me.

515
01:14:28,773 --> 01:14:30,741
I promise on you. - No son!

516
01:14:31,109 --> 01:14:33,907
You promised to get state rank in
10th class on Grandma.

517
01:14:34,112 --> 01:14:34,908
Poor Grandma!

518
01:14:36,781 --> 01:14:39,249
That is... Grandma was little hasty.

519
01:14:41,619 --> 01:14:42,586
I promise on you father.

520
01:14:47,292 --> 01:14:51,592
Mother, father, I'm dying in hunger.
Oh mother, serve me food.

521
01:14:58,136 --> 01:14:59,763
What happened to my puris?

522
01:14:59,971 --> 01:15:02,269
Which Puri?
Amrish Puri or Om Puri?

523
01:15:02,974 --> 01:15:03,941
Eating Puris!

524
01:15:06,811 --> 01:15:07,778
You might've eaten it.

525
01:15:08,313 --> 01:15:10,611
No, you might've eaten it.

526
01:15:11,649 --> 01:15:14,117
Look at my plate.
My Puris are here only.

527
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:15,445
What might have happened
to my Puris?

528
01:15:16,154 --> 01:15:17,621
You're cheating me.

529
01:15:17,822 --> 01:15:20,791
Mother look, brother has
taken away my Puris.

530
01:15:20,992 --> 01:15:23,790
Why do you want to eat Puri?
Eat rice!

531
01:15:28,666 --> 01:15:30,133
What happened to my Puris?

532
01:15:31,002 --> 01:15:32,128
Thieves have stolen it.

533
01:15:32,337 --> 01:15:33,804
Why're you behaving like a child?

534
01:15:34,005 --> 01:15:35,131
Just now, you eat it, father.

535
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:36,967
Mother, serve him curd rice.

536
01:15:41,012 --> 01:15:41,979
I'm finished with my meals.

537
01:15:52,857 --> 01:15:57,487
Take Puris... It'll taste good.
My mother is a good cook.

538
01:16:05,036 --> 01:16:07,504
Drink water. - Not me.

539
01:16:09,874 --> 01:16:10,340
Who's that?

540
01:16:13,211 --> 01:16:15,179
Who's that? - It's me, father.

541
01:16:16,381 --> 01:16:17,348
Shall I bring water?

542
01:16:18,216 --> 01:16:19,012
I'll come myself.

543
01:16:26,558 --> 01:16:27,525
Take water!

544
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:29,685
Drink!

545
01:16:34,399 --> 01:16:35,195
I'll go inside & drink.

546
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,028
Why am I hearing 2 hiccups?

547
01:16:38,236 --> 01:16:40,363
I hurt my vocal cords in practice!

548
01:16:40,738 --> 01:16:42,035
If anyone practices too much,

549
01:16:42,407 --> 01:16:44,034
He's likely to hurt his spinal cord.

550
01:16:44,242 --> 01:16:45,709
How could you hurt your vocal cord?

551
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:46,535
Yes, isn't it?

552
01:16:47,412 --> 01:16:50,381
That's father...
Laddu strangled my neck.

553
01:17:06,097 --> 01:17:08,895
Swapna, no need to worry anymore.

554
01:17:10,435 --> 01:17:12,403
I'll make all arrangements for you
to go to America.

555
01:17:13,438 --> 01:17:15,235
I'll apply for your Passport or
Visa tomorrow.

556
01:17:16,274 --> 01:17:17,400
As your parents had wished,

557
01:17:17,609 --> 01:17:19,907
You can go to your Uncle in America
and study well.

558
01:17:20,445 --> 01:17:21,070
Okay?

559
01:17:21,613 --> 01:17:23,080
Don't worry anymore, sleep well.

560
01:18:22,674 --> 01:18:23,971
Hey, you big boy!

561
01:18:24,676 --> 01:18:26,644
Have you come here to attend
a function?

562
01:18:27,512 --> 01:18:29,980
Instead of beheading the man
who had hit your brother,

563
01:18:30,181 --> 01:18:31,648
And throw his head at your
brother's feet.

564
01:18:31,849 --> 01:18:33,646
What's the use of you being
a Home Minister?

565
01:18:34,352 --> 01:18:39,312
You've 10 cars, Police & Security
following you. Yuck!

566
01:18:39,524 --> 01:18:41,321
Who dared to hit my brother?

567
01:18:41,526 --> 01:18:42,151
I don't know.

568
01:18:47,198 --> 01:18:47,823
Where'll he be?

569
01:18:49,867 --> 01:18:50,492
Don't know!

570
01:18:51,703 --> 01:18:53,671
Shit!

571
01:18:55,707 --> 01:18:56,833
Do you know in which
direction he went?

572
01:18:58,376 --> 01:19:00,003
Towards Hyderabad.

573
01:19:03,381 --> 01:19:08,341
I'll make Police search from Ramoji film
city to Ranga Reddy Dist. Border.

574
01:19:08,886 --> 01:19:10,183
I'll bring her & conduct
your marriage.

575
01:19:10,388 --> 01:19:11,855
That's manliness.

576
01:19:12,223 --> 01:19:13,690
Now, you've proved that
you're my son.

577
01:19:13,891 --> 01:19:16,519
Son, consider that you're
married to her.

578
01:19:17,729 --> 01:19:21,358
First, his death.
Then, my marriage.

579
01:19:37,582 --> 01:19:39,379
Hey! You've stamped
on the tail of a snake.

580
01:19:39,584 --> 01:19:41,051
That Obul Reddy is
no ordinary man.

581
01:19:41,419 --> 01:19:42,386
Obul Reddy means?

582
01:19:42,987 --> 01:19:44,318
By any chance, he isn't Siva Reddy's
brother, is he?

583
01:19:45,256 --> 01:19:47,383
Siva Reddy? Who's he?

584
01:19:47,592 --> 01:19:49,287
Your father's boss,
the Home Minister.

585
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:51,218
The entire state is
under his thumbs.

586
01:19:51,596 --> 01:19:53,223
It's impossible to
escape from him.

587
01:19:53,598 --> 01:19:55,896
Anyway, you've sent away
that girl, haven't you?

588
01:19:56,267 --> 01:19:57,894
If you're careful for few days,
that's enough.

589
01:19:58,836 --> 01:19:59,734
How am I to send her?

590
01:20:00,438 --> 01:20:01,496
Don't you want a passport
& Visa for it?

591
01:20:02,507 --> 01:20:06,967
That means... That girl is still...
where is she?

592
01:20:07,945 --> 01:20:09,913
I've hidden her in the
wardrobe of my room.

593
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:11,606
In your home?

594
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:14,477
You're father is a
strict disciplinarian.

595
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:16,880
It's like you're hanging between
the devil and the deep sea.

596
01:20:17,288 --> 01:20:18,915
How could you hide
her in your house?

597
01:20:19,457 --> 01:20:20,924
I thought! It's the safest
place for the present.

598
01:20:21,125 --> 01:20:23,252
It's very difficult to send her
to foreign in present situation.

599
01:20:23,628 --> 01:20:25,255
Getting passport & Visa
isn't so easy.

600
01:20:25,463 --> 01:20:26,953
Getting passport easily
isn't difficult for us.

601
01:20:27,532 --> 01:20:30,592
Instruct us what is to
be done at which time.

602
01:20:30,802 --> 01:20:32,167
Though, we had lost
the Kurnool match.

603
01:20:32,804 --> 01:20:34,032
...We must win this game.

604
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:35,765
Yes.

605
01:20:37,475 --> 01:20:38,772
You had put entire
Hyderabad to shame.

606
01:20:39,143 --> 01:20:39,609
Yuck.

607
01:20:40,812 --> 01:20:42,109
How could you come back
here shamelessly?

608
01:20:42,313 --> 01:20:43,280
Who're you to sneer at us?

609
01:20:43,815 --> 01:20:44,440
You carry on.

610
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:48,678
You should've shown your
prowess on the ground.

611
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:51,787
These boys are back streets heroes,
they're zeros on the ground.

612
01:20:51,989 --> 01:20:54,116
Why do you want to enter
National Level Competitions?

613
01:20:54,325 --> 01:20:55,451
Why can't you be just street dogs?

614
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:57,958
Don't jeer at us like girls,
if you've guts, let's decide it.

615
01:21:01,499 --> 01:21:01,965
Come...

616
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,797
Why're you stopping me?
They're making fun of us.

617
01:21:05,002 --> 01:21:05,627
Not now.

618
01:21:05,837 --> 01:21:07,464
What happened to you?
Are you yourself?

619
01:21:07,672 --> 01:21:08,798
Am I not saying, not now?

620
01:21:09,006 --> 01:21:10,200
Should we keep quiet then?

621
01:21:10,408 --> 01:21:13,969
You all are not just unfit to play,
even to fight also.

622
01:21:15,513 --> 01:21:17,640
May be they had got
castrated in Kurnool.

623
01:21:18,182 --> 01:21:19,649
They're sneering & jeering at us &
we're taking all like eunuchs.

624
01:21:19,851 --> 01:21:21,819
More than losing the game, their words
are making me furious.

625
01:21:22,019 --> 01:21:23,816
Don't you know about my not temper.

626
01:21:26,023 --> 01:21:28,253
Till that girl leaves Indian
shores for America,

627
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:30,657
At any cost we mustn't turn
attraction towards us.

628
01:21:31,529 --> 01:21:34,657
Save all this temper and use it
when the occasion arises.

629
01:21:38,703 --> 01:21:40,671
Great Acid Batch!

630
01:21:41,205 --> 01:21:42,672
Don't ever cross swords
with Soda batch again.

631
01:21:43,207 --> 01:21:44,834
What happened to them, buddy?

632
01:21:45,543 --> 01:21:47,170
They never used to tolerate
even a word of fun.

633
01:21:47,712 --> 01:21:49,009
Do you think something really
had happened in Kurnool?

634
01:21:49,213 --> 01:21:50,510
Something must've happened
in Kurnool.

635
01:21:50,948 --> 01:21:53,178
I've alerted all city
border check posts.

636
01:21:53,718 --> 01:21:55,185
I've put on traffic police
also on duty.

637
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:57,253
He can't escape from our trap.

638
01:21:57,555 --> 01:22:00,251
We've handed over the case to the
best officers in the Department.

639
01:22:05,563 --> 01:22:06,359
What are you all doing?

640
01:22:07,231 --> 01:22:09,529
Is your Police Department sleeping?

641
01:22:09,734 --> 01:22:10,359
Or is it working?

642
01:22:10,735 --> 01:22:13,203
He's sleeping & accusing
the department.

643
01:22:13,738 --> 01:22:15,865
Check every lane and
bylane of Hyderabad.

644
01:22:17,074 --> 01:22:20,271
I'm not able to beat
to see to my brother,

645
01:22:21,412 --> 01:22:26,111
Someone has eloped with my brother's
future wife. - Not eloped, but kidnapped.

646
01:22:26,317 --> 01:22:27,875
Kidnap... Kidnap.

647
01:22:28,753 --> 01:22:30,550
I don't know how you'll do it.

648
01:22:31,756 --> 01:22:35,715
In 24 hours, find the girl &
finish him off.

649
01:22:50,675 --> 01:22:52,302
Take it, change to this dress.

650
01:22:55,279 --> 01:22:56,405
What happened to the
girl's passport?

651
01:22:57,281 --> 01:22:58,908
I don't want to hear all that crap
manage it yourself.

652
01:23:03,287 --> 01:23:03,912
Mother.

653
01:23:05,122 --> 01:23:05,918
I'll call you later.

654
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:08,421
I had kept my dress on
the bed here, where's it?

655
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:09,585
What dress?

656
01:23:10,294 --> 01:23:11,090
I had kept it here only.

657
01:23:11,295 --> 01:23:12,819
Why do I find you always
in my room?

658
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:14,088
Can't you use the bathroom
of mother's bedroom?

659
01:23:14,298 --> 01:23:15,765
It was yellow dress.
I had kept it here only.

660
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:17,591
You're stressing on yellow dress.

661
01:23:18,469 --> 01:23:19,936
Did you promise anyone that
you'll come in that dress?

662
01:23:20,137 --> 01:23:21,104
Hey, you keep quiet.

663
01:23:22,974 --> 01:23:25,272
This's my wardrobe. How many times do
I've to tell you not to touch it?

664
01:23:26,077 --> 01:23:29,046
Okay, I shouldn't touch it.
That's all, isn't it?

665
01:23:31,649 --> 01:23:32,445
Mother.

666
01:23:33,651 --> 01:23:34,618
Why did you shout like that?

667
01:23:41,158 --> 01:23:41,954
To scare you.

668
01:23:42,493 --> 01:23:43,460
Got scared, didn't you?

669
01:23:43,661 --> 01:23:44,787
You went little over board.

670
01:23:45,997 --> 01:23:47,123
Did you see? My dress.

671
01:23:47,832 --> 01:23:48,457
It's here only.

672
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:26,995
Here.

673
01:24:28,205 --> 01:24:28,830
Here... here...

674
01:24:49,727 --> 01:24:50,352
Have this juice.

675
01:24:52,229 --> 01:24:54,197
Is your practicing going on well?
- It's going on well, mother.

676
01:24:54,398 --> 01:24:55,524
Finish your juice and
give me the glass.

677
01:24:55,733 --> 01:24:57,360
I'll bring the glass... You go out.
- You finish it first.

678
01:24:57,568 --> 01:24:58,762
You go out, I'll bring it.

679
01:25:00,571 --> 01:25:01,367
What's it, mother?

680
01:25:01,739 --> 01:25:02,865
Move away. - What?

681
01:25:03,074 --> 01:25:03,540
Move.

682
01:25:04,075 --> 01:25:04,700
Come on, move I say.

683
01:25:08,746 --> 01:25:10,111
Move... don't block my view.

684
01:25:18,422 --> 01:25:18,888
What's it, mother?

685
01:25:19,690 --> 01:25:21,590
Something is missing from this doll.

686
01:25:22,927 --> 01:25:25,054
It's a doll, isn't it?
May be it's lifeless.

687
01:25:31,168 --> 01:25:32,567
This is missing from it. - Mother!

688
01:25:33,437 --> 01:25:36,133
Vermilion? I'll keep it.
Give it to me.

689
01:25:45,950 --> 01:25:47,577
Look, how beautiful it's now.

690
01:25:48,452 --> 01:25:50,579
You must get such a beautiful wife.

691
01:25:51,122 --> 01:25:54,580
Let's try it... Okay... Come
...Come... hold this glass.

692
01:25:54,959 --> 01:25:55,425
Come.

693
01:26:06,804 --> 01:26:08,101
I've brought a new cell phone.

694
01:26:09,206 --> 01:26:12,175
I must hear your voice first
in this SIM card.

695
01:26:13,077 --> 01:26:18,606
That's why, leaving out Savithri,
I've called you first.

696
01:26:19,316 --> 01:26:20,943
I'll tell you my number,
please take down.

697
01:26:33,497 --> 01:26:34,521
Who're you all?

698
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:37,296
Come to the matter.

699
01:26:37,835 --> 01:26:38,961
Oh! Are you a Sugar Patient?

700
01:26:39,503 --> 01:26:41,801
No, jaggery patient, I may've anything.
Why're you worried? Come to the point.

701
01:26:43,007 --> 01:26:46,465
Matter is... his cousins' passport.
- We'll send it by post.

702
01:26:46,844 --> 01:26:48,812
That means, you'll not hand it
over personally. - No.

703
01:26:58,689 --> 01:26:59,986
Money is lying on the table,
is it yours?

704
01:27:00,191 --> 01:27:02,159
No, it's yours! Take it and
put into your pockets.

705
01:27:02,526 --> 01:27:04,323
Otherwise, police will come
and take it.

706
01:27:09,366 --> 01:27:11,493
500 kgs Laddus...
800 kgs Jilebis...

707
01:27:11,702 --> 01:27:12,691
Will you take your sweet
shop outside?

708
01:27:13,537 --> 01:27:14,401
I'm expecting a call.

709
01:27:14,605 --> 01:27:15,094
You come here.

710
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:16,665
You wait, man.

711
01:27:17,708 --> 01:27:18,834
Then, you'll not give the
passport personally.

712
01:27:19,376 --> 01:27:21,344
Giving passport personally
is against rules.

713
01:27:21,545 --> 01:27:23,342
For God's sake.

714
01:27:25,216 --> 01:27:25,910
Phone is very good.

715
01:27:29,386 --> 01:27:30,910
What was his cell number?

716
01:27:47,738 --> 01:27:49,603
What darling? Hey Tony!

717
01:27:50,174 --> 01:27:51,539
It's me, Shiva.

718
01:27:52,176 --> 01:27:52,870
Where're you, man?

719
01:27:53,410 --> 01:27:55,878
Look Shiva, my name is Subramanyam.

720
01:27:56,313 --> 01:27:58,873
This isn't Tony's phone number,
this is my phone.

721
01:27:59,416 --> 01:28:00,280
This is not Tony's.

722
01:28:01,585 --> 01:28:02,882
Tony's number must be having
some other number.

723
01:28:05,589 --> 01:28:06,055
Cut the line.

724
01:28:07,258 --> 01:28:07,724
You call him.

725
01:28:17,601 --> 01:28:19,899
Tony, trouble has erupted
in old city.

726
01:28:20,337 --> 01:28:22,396
Come quickly, bloody rascal
we're waiting for you.

727
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:27,739
Hey man! My name is Subramanyam.
I'm a passport officer, not Tony.

728
01:28:28,112 --> 01:28:30,580
Someone had just called like this only.
Inform them also.

729
01:28:32,783 --> 01:28:34,250
He has cut the line.
Now, it's Laddus' turn.

730
01:28:34,618 --> 01:28:35,243
You call him.

731
01:28:42,793 --> 01:28:44,420
Tony, it's me Feroze.

732
01:28:44,962 --> 01:28:47,192
Hey, while coming home,
bring 8 kgs of chicken.

733
01:28:47,798 --> 01:28:50,596
Hey listen, if possible get
a kilo of mutton also.

734
01:28:51,802 --> 01:28:55,260
What's all this non-sense about
chicken & mutton, bloody fools?

735
01:28:56,707 --> 01:29:01,440
My name is Subramanyam. I'm a passport
officer. Cut the call.

736
01:29:02,313 --> 01:29:03,780
I'll now give the finishing touch.

737
01:29:04,148 --> 01:29:04,773
Watch out.

738
01:29:18,329 --> 01:29:21,628
I'm Tony speaking,
did I get any phone calls?

739
01:29:24,435 --> 01:29:28,235
Tony! Am I your personal
telephone operator?

740
01:29:28,672 --> 01:29:29,969
I'm a Passport Officer.

741
01:29:30,507 --> 01:29:32,304
I bought a new cell phone.

742
01:29:32,676 --> 01:29:33,973
One calls & says I'm Shiva.

743
01:29:34,345 --> 01:29:35,972
Another calls up me to old city.

744
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:38,476
Another calls up and asks me
to bring chicken & mutton.

745
01:29:38,849 --> 01:29:40,976
Why're you torturing me like this?

746
01:29:41,985 --> 01:29:45,045
It isn't you who's torturing me?
...This cell phone.

747
01:29:45,856 --> 01:29:47,721
This is torturing me.

748
01:29:48,025 --> 01:29:49,492
If I didn't have a cell phone.

749
01:29:49,693 --> 01:29:50,159
Yes.

750
01:29:57,301 --> 01:29:59,166
Where's your passport?
- It's here only.

751
01:29:59,536 --> 01:30:01,003
Take it... take all passports.

752
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:03,665
Here it is.

753
01:30:07,878 --> 01:30:08,845
Your darlings' phone call.

754
01:30:15,386 --> 01:30:17,684
Passport work is over.
Now, it's time to get Visa.

755
01:30:18,722 --> 01:30:21,190
Police have seized the Gypsy in which
you brought Swapna from Kurnool.

756
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:00,726
What're we going to do now?

757
01:31:04,768 --> 01:31:06,065
What're you boys doing here?

758
01:31:06,937 --> 01:31:09,405
Seeing a crowd here...
Curiosity brought us here.

759
01:31:09,606 --> 01:31:12,404
What's there to see here?
Go & practice your game.

760
01:31:12,609 --> 01:31:13,906
Till now, we were practicing.

761
01:31:14,611 --> 01:31:16,738
Don't just make empty promises
about winning cups.

762
01:31:17,381 --> 01:31:20,908
You must win & show it.
Go & practice till you win the cup.

763
01:31:22,119 --> 01:31:23,245
Sir, sniffer dogs are on the way.

764
01:31:32,796 --> 01:31:36,755
Sniffer dogs mean... lt'll find smell,
follow you to your home.

765
01:31:37,134 --> 01:31:38,431
If your father's comes
to know this?

766
01:32:14,705 --> 01:32:16,798
Swapna, it isn't safe to
be here any more.

767
01:32:17,508 --> 01:32:20,477
I think, we'll get caught.
Come, let's go away from here.

768
01:32:26,517 --> 01:32:27,814
Who's that Swapna?

769
01:32:28,018 --> 01:32:30,145
Swapna? Who's Swapna?

770
01:32:30,354 --> 01:32:33,152
Will you tell me about her?
Or shall I tell father?

771
01:32:33,357 --> 01:32:37,987
I beg of you, please don't tell anyone.
- Okay, what's the matter?

772
01:32:39,196 --> 01:32:41,824
Asha, who else do I've
other than you?

773
01:32:43,367 --> 01:32:44,493
Whether its elder or younger sister,
its you only, isn't it?

774
01:32:44,735 --> 01:32:47,670
Come to the point, brother.
Who's this Swapna?

775
01:32:49,706 --> 01:32:50,502
That is...

776
01:33:07,558 --> 01:33:09,025
I'll follow all your orders.

777
01:33:09,226 --> 01:33:10,523
If you want occupy this room also.

778
01:33:10,961 --> 01:33:12,861
Save me from this crisis.

779
01:33:17,234 --> 01:33:19,031
You both go to the
terrace immediately.

780
01:33:19,236 --> 01:33:20,863
If anyone comes in,
I'll manage.

781
01:33:22,973 --> 01:33:26,534
I think kidnapper is very clever.
He has taken all precautions.

782
01:33:26,743 --> 01:33:29,211
Sniffer dogs' efforts have
also turned futile.

783
01:33:29,413 --> 01:33:31,711
I feel he has left the Gypsy
here to mislead us.

784
01:33:34,985 --> 01:33:36,543
But, still don't give
up your hopes.

785
01:33:36,787 --> 01:33:39,051
If you need, request Task Force's
support also.

786
01:33:42,926 --> 01:33:46,054
You never go home through right path,
that saved you the day.

787
01:33:46,263 --> 01:33:49,892
Buddy, dogs failed to find anything.
- No clues were found.

788
01:33:50,601 --> 01:33:51,727
The girl is safe, isn't she?

789
01:33:54,805 --> 01:33:56,898
Didn't I warn you earlier your
father is a dictator?

790
01:33:57,107 --> 01:33:58,574
Not to keep that girl
in your house.

791
01:33:58,942 --> 01:34:00,739
We've been saved because
police were mislead.

792
01:34:01,445 --> 01:34:02,742
By the way, where's that girl?

793
01:34:15,525 --> 01:34:17,425
Where're they?

794
01:34:19,463 --> 01:34:20,760
Look there, come quickly.

795
01:34:21,131 --> 01:34:22,758
Then, I'll take Swapna with me &
finish the Visa work.

796
01:34:22,966 --> 01:34:24,763
You keep track of National
Games' proceedings.

797
01:34:24,968 --> 01:34:25,593
Okay, buddy.

798
01:34:25,802 --> 01:34:27,770
Didn't I tell you my brother had
brought a girl from Kurnool?

799
01:34:28,005 --> 01:34:29,438
This is that girl.

800
01:34:30,474 --> 01:34:31,941
The dress she's wearing also mine,
you know that?

801
01:34:32,142 --> 01:34:33,109
Come, shake hands with her.

802
01:34:37,147 --> 01:34:38,944
What's this? Do you think
the girl is a doll?

803
01:34:39,149 --> 01:34:40,116
Says how cute!

804
01:34:40,817 --> 01:34:42,284
Why did you bring all your gang?

805
01:34:42,486 --> 01:34:44,454
Is there anyone yet to know, have you
finished telling the entire town?

806
01:34:44,655 --> 01:34:45,121
You shut up.

807
01:34:45,322 --> 01:34:48,780
Swapna, you don't worry
we all are with you.

808
01:34:49,159 --> 01:34:51,627
You come to school with us.
- To school?

809
01:34:52,562 --> 01:34:55,622
No need to be patient any more.
Laddu. - Yes, buddy.

810
01:34:55,832 --> 01:35:00,132
Take and buy them ice-creams,
chocolates, Lollipops & Laddus also.

811
01:35:00,370 --> 01:35:04,466
Come... Come girls... what do you want?
Cadbury or Lollipop?

812
01:35:05,042 --> 01:35:07,135
Don't you sell King Fishers
and Bagpipers?

813
01:35:07,844 --> 01:35:08,970
Okay, buy them that.

814
01:35:09,179 --> 01:35:10,806
Brother... Father...

815
01:35:13,383 --> 01:35:14,475
Come, Swapna.

816
01:35:24,528 --> 01:35:25,324
Asha, come here.

817
01:35:27,197 --> 01:35:28,824
Come... - I'll not come.

818
01:35:35,372 --> 01:35:35,997
Stop.

819
01:35:38,208 --> 01:35:39,106
Stop, I say.

820
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:44,108
Stop.

821
01:35:51,555 --> 01:35:52,852
Hey brother, catch her.

822
01:35:53,056 --> 01:35:54,250
Sister, stop.

823
01:35:55,058 --> 01:35:56,116
Brother, run fast.

824
01:36:01,732 --> 01:36:05,190
Mad fellows.
- Brother, catch her.

825
01:36:05,402 --> 01:36:05,868
Stop.

826
01:36:06,069 --> 01:36:09,800
Brother catch her.
- Brother, catch me.

827
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:17,879
What might have happened?

828
01:36:21,151 --> 01:36:22,709
May be she has remembered
her own folks.

829
01:36:22,953 --> 01:36:24,386
What shall we do, brother?

830
01:36:38,502 --> 01:36:39,901
What day is today?

831
01:36:42,773 --> 01:36:44,400
How can you know days & date?

832
01:36:45,175 --> 01:36:46,073
Today, its Friday.

833
01:36:48,945 --> 01:36:50,071
So, don't cry today.

834
01:36:50,947 --> 01:36:52,073
If you want, cry tomorrow.

835
01:36:52,783 --> 01:36:54,250
Looks like you had cried
yesterday also.

836
01:36:55,185 --> 01:36:56,584
But, don't cry today.

837
01:37:04,127 --> 01:37:05,094
Turn back and see.

838
01:37:21,545 --> 01:37:22,944
So today, it's your birthday.

839
01:37:35,826 --> 01:37:36,793
Blow it.

840
01:37:49,573 --> 01:37:52,133
Lollipop, what're you watching?
Offer her cake.

841
01:37:56,179 --> 01:37:57,305
For whom did you bring this?

842
01:44:40,583 --> 01:44:42,380
Sir, we must start
the consecration also.

843
01:44:42,585 --> 01:44:43,882
You take bath and come, sir.

844
01:44:44,087 --> 01:44:45,054
You'll be dead next moment.

845
01:44:45,255 --> 01:44:46,552
Now, he's in Love meditation.

846
01:44:46,756 --> 01:44:49,384
He'll not take bath.
You consecrate it with milk.

847
01:44:49,592 --> 01:44:51,719
Milk... Milk...
Consecrate it with Milk.

848
01:44:51,995 --> 01:44:53,394
Yes, it's me Dhoondy.

849
01:44:53,930 --> 01:44:56,558
Yes, what you heard is true.
It's that girls' idol only.

850
01:44:57,267 --> 01:45:01,567
You heard about temple built for
Amitabh in Kolkota & Kushbu in Tamil Nadu.

851
01:45:01,771 --> 01:45:04,899
Obul Reddy is praying that
girl like a Goddess.

852
01:45:05,775 --> 01:45:10,075
Offerings? Is it Lord Sathyanarayana's
prayer to offer offerings?

853
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:12,739
Don't spread this news.
I'll cut the line now.

854
01:45:12,949 --> 01:45:18,751
What's this sir, he's wasting 100 ltrs
of Milk, 50 ltrs honey & 50 ltrs ghee.

855
01:45:18,955 --> 01:45:20,422
He can give it to a poor man
like me, can't he?

856
01:45:20,623 --> 01:45:22,250
If you go and give him this idea.

857
01:45:22,458 --> 01:45:25,256
He'll drain out all your blood &
consecrate the idol with it.

858
01:45:25,962 --> 01:45:27,259
The problem isn't that.

859
01:45:27,697 --> 01:45:31,428
The entire State is eagerly
waiting, when he'll take bath.

860
01:45:38,241 --> 01:45:41,108
Elder son.

861
01:45:45,648 --> 01:45:47,616
Have you finished your
meeting in A.C. Rooms?

862
01:45:48,151 --> 01:45:50,119
How many more days will you keep
on searching that girl?

863
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:51,947
He's going madder with
every day passing.

864
01:45:52,155 --> 01:45:55,283
I feel he'll turn into a stone
praying madly.

865
01:45:55,658 --> 01:45:56,852
This is turning to be
a futile exercise.

866
01:45:57,160 --> 01:46:01,290
Shall I get Lorry loads from
Jammalamadugu & Allagadda?

867
01:46:01,664 --> 01:46:05,122
They'll go on behead people,
till they find that boy.

868
01:46:05,335 --> 01:46:07,633
I'm giving you just one more day.

869
01:46:07,837 --> 01:46:10,465
Find her, bloody fool!
You follow me.

870
01:46:11,541 --> 01:46:13,133
Did you hear that?

871
01:46:14,410 --> 01:46:16,810
If the matter goes to her,
this will be the style.

872
01:46:17,547 --> 01:46:18,980
You don't know about my mother.

873
01:46:19,682 --> 01:46:22,310
C. M had offered me Ministry of
Home after meeting her.

874
01:46:22,518 --> 01:46:24,486
She'll do what she says, be careful.
- You take this sir.

875
01:46:25,355 --> 01:46:27,482
That girl's photo is in this,
take it.

876
01:46:58,888 --> 01:47:00,856
Oh! What's bad dream!

877
01:47:18,074 --> 01:47:20,201
Who's this girl? Looks like
new to this area.

878
01:47:20,410 --> 01:47:22,378
This was the girl who was dancing
with Ajay 2 days earlier.

879
01:47:22,612 --> 01:47:24,546
Why is she coming out
at this hour?

880
01:47:25,415 --> 01:47:28,043
Is this girl having any connection
with Ajay's change of heart?

881
01:47:28,284 --> 01:47:29,376
Let's ask her.

882
01:47:42,932 --> 01:47:44,559
What is Kurnool's code?

883
01:47:47,170 --> 01:47:47,898
That side.

884
01:48:04,654 --> 01:48:06,417
What's it?
What're you doing here?

885
01:48:06,656 --> 01:48:11,252
We came out for a tea. - Finished your
tea, isn't it? Go... Go home.

886
01:48:31,347 --> 01:48:34,441
Where's your home?
- Near by only.

887
01:48:35,017 --> 01:48:38,453
Come, I'll drop you.
- No problem, I'll go myself.

888
01:48:38,888 --> 01:48:41,789
My house is also nearby only.
Come, I'll drop you and go.

889
01:48:45,561 --> 01:48:46,619
You go now and come back
early morning.

890
01:48:49,832 --> 01:48:50,799
Come.

891
01:48:52,668 --> 01:48:54,465
I never saw you in this street.

892
01:48:54,670 --> 01:48:55,796
We've come here recently.

893
01:48:56,239 --> 01:48:57,297
Uncle, I'll go.

894
01:48:57,507 --> 01:49:01,307
This area isn't that safe, no problem.
I'll drop you at home.

895
01:49:01,511 --> 01:49:02,136
Come.

896
01:49:09,018 --> 01:49:13,318
This is my house. - This one?

897
01:49:14,257 --> 01:49:16,316
Yes. I'll go now, uncle.

898
01:49:17,927 --> 01:49:21,488
I had come up to here. Come, I'll hand
over you to your people & go.

899
01:49:39,882 --> 01:49:40,678
This boy?

900
01:49:50,293 --> 01:49:52,193
Would you please give me some water?

901
01:49:53,162 --> 01:49:56,188
Looks like he's a sticky fellow.
He's not leaving me.

902
01:49:56,399 --> 01:49:57,366
Please come in.

903
01:50:06,442 --> 01:50:08,376
Please come in...
Please sit down.

904
01:50:16,786 --> 01:50:19,220
Please, give him company.

905
01:50:21,157 --> 01:50:23,091
Come...

906
01:50:29,599 --> 01:50:34,059
You keep talking to each other,
I'll get water for you.

907
01:50:41,811 --> 01:50:43,073
She's... his younger sister.

908
01:50:43,446 --> 01:50:48,247
Correct uncle!
Hey, greet uncle.

909
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:52,248
Greetings, uncle.

910
01:50:53,623 --> 01:50:56,091
I'll get water for you.

911
01:50:59,629 --> 01:51:03,759
Who's this girl?
- It seems she's his fiancee.

912
01:51:03,966 --> 01:51:05,263
It seems she's her sister-in-law.

913
01:51:06,135 --> 01:51:08,603
What're you to her, then?
- Mother-in-law.

914
01:51:09,805 --> 01:51:10,772
Mother-in-law... Mother-in-law.

915
01:51:11,307 --> 01:51:12,103
Good.

916
01:51:13,843 --> 01:51:16,107
What's all this meeting prospective
bride at night?

917
01:51:16,379 --> 01:51:17,607
Stop feeling shy.

918
01:51:17,813 --> 01:51:20,941
She's beautiful even when I see
her with sleepy eyes.

919
01:51:21,183 --> 01:51:22,445
What've you studied?

920
01:51:22,652 --> 01:51:25,780
Do you know to sing & dance?
You might be knowing it all.

921
01:51:26,389 --> 01:51:28,118
My mother-in-law talks very funnily.

922
01:51:28,324 --> 01:51:29,791
What's all this meeting
prospective bride?

923
01:51:30,159 --> 01:51:31,626
Marriage is nearing

924
01:51:32,995 --> 01:51:33,962
What's all this?

925
01:51:34,664 --> 01:51:36,461
Have you fixed the marriage
without informing me?

926
01:51:36,666 --> 01:51:38,293
They had informed me also, just now.

927
01:51:38,501 --> 01:51:41,470
Hello, why isn't the groom
saying anything?

928
01:51:42,505 --> 01:51:47,636
Sir, will you marry here or
in your father-in-law's place?

929
01:51:47,843 --> 01:51:49,140
Why do you want to know all that?

930
01:51:49,345 --> 01:51:51,813
I mean, why do you want
to know it now?

931
01:51:52,014 --> 01:51:53,641
Poor uncle, I think he has
plenty of leisure time.

932
01:51:53,949 --> 01:51:56,474
He's sticking around here without
going to his home.

933
01:51:56,686 --> 01:51:58,813
He asked for water...
If I give... he'll go...

934
01:52:55,945 --> 01:52:56,536
Give me your hand.

935
01:53:11,293 --> 01:53:13,227
Can't you help me without
standing & watching fun?

936
01:53:14,764 --> 01:53:16,891
Not me... help him.

937
01:53:50,399 --> 01:53:53,596
You had to face unnecessarily problems
in your home also for me.

938
01:53:53,803 --> 01:53:56,101
It's quite common to me.
You don't worry about it.

939
01:53:56,305 --> 01:53:58,432
Looks like National games are
also fast approaching.

940
01:53:58,808 --> 01:54:01,276
You don't seem to be
practicing also.

941
01:54:01,477 --> 01:54:03,775
For the present, I don't have one goal,
but two goals.

942
01:54:04,146 --> 01:54:06,944
To send you to America
and win the cup.

943
01:54:12,221 --> 01:54:13,779
Where am I to hide you?

944
01:54:15,558 --> 01:54:19,460
I must hide you secretly like Sorcerer
hiding Princess in a one pillar palace.

945
01:55:35,571 --> 01:55:36,538
Come here.

946
01:56:00,596 --> 01:56:04,896
Oh God! I'm getting crazy ideas.
- What ideas?

947
01:56:05,434 --> 01:56:08,232
Do you feel like presenting
the crescent moon to me?

948
01:56:08,437 --> 01:56:10,064
I feel like scratching
my back with it.

949
01:56:18,948 --> 01:56:22,247
Don't know what magical effect
you've created on me?

950
01:56:22,451 --> 01:56:25,079
It's good... what next?

951
01:56:26,288 --> 01:56:27,414
Just a minute...

952
01:56:27,623 --> 01:56:29,591
Do you feel cold? - No.

953
01:56:30,159 --> 01:56:31,251
Give me your chunni.

954
01:56:32,695 --> 01:56:34,253
Give me, I'm feeling cold.

955
01:56:38,801 --> 01:56:40,928
Magic? Did I do?

956
01:56:42,638 --> 01:56:46,768
Don't know what magical effect,
you've created on me?

957
01:56:48,177 --> 01:56:52,273
Oh Heart! Tell me the truth.

958
02:01:55,017 --> 02:01:56,416
Suddenly, I feel asleep.

959
02:01:58,020 --> 02:01:59,112
Song is over?

960
02:01:59,621 --> 02:02:00,087
Yes.

961
02:02:01,290 --> 02:02:02,757
Looks like day is breaking in.

962
02:02:03,792 --> 02:02:06,090
By the way, I forgot to tell you,
your visa is ready.

963
02:02:06,295 --> 02:02:07,592
Your flight is scheduled
at tomorrow afternoon.

964
02:02:22,544 --> 02:02:24,046
Yes sir, we saw her.

965
02:02:24,046 --> 02:02:27,174
The man you're searching Ajay is non
other than S.P. Vijay Verma's son.

966
02:02:27,382 --> 02:02:28,508
He lives in old city area.

967
02:02:28,717 --> 02:02:30,344
Yes sir, very near to Charminar.

968
02:02:54,142 --> 02:02:56,269
I think he'll now take bath.

969
02:03:10,592 --> 02:03:13,220
Hey, search everywhere.
He'll be somewhere here only.

970
02:03:21,603 --> 02:03:22,729
Come out.

971
02:03:26,174 --> 02:03:28,642
Do you know in whose house
you're creating trouble?

972
02:03:28,844 --> 02:03:32,803
Don't ask me that question.
Ask your son, he'll answer.

973
02:03:33,348 --> 02:03:37,978
He'll say father, I've eloped with his
fiancee, he might've come for her.

974
02:03:38,687 --> 02:03:43,147
I don't have any interest in anything
other than a girl's body.

975
02:03:43,358 --> 02:03:46,327
For the first time, in my life,
I fell in love.

976
02:03:46,695 --> 02:03:49,664
I've become mad for her.
She has mesmerized me.

977
02:03:49,898 --> 02:03:51,661
I can't see anything else.

978
02:03:52,367 --> 02:03:55,359
I can see only that girl and
your son, who eloped with her.

979
02:03:55,570 --> 02:03:57,162
I'll see his end.

980
02:03:57,572 --> 02:03:59,836
Brother, there's a secret way
out from the room.

981
02:04:10,051 --> 02:04:12,019
Hey, this area is very good.

982
02:04:13,255 --> 02:04:16,850
On one side, I feel like eating a sweet
betel leaf from my lover Swapna.

983
02:04:17,125 --> 02:04:21,027
Another side, I feel like behead your son
and hang it on the Charminar.

984
02:04:22,397 --> 02:04:26,857
DCP, you might have seen
communal clashes here.

985
02:04:27,068 --> 02:04:28,695
Beheading people of our caste.

986
02:04:28,904 --> 02:04:32,863
You might've not seen rivers of flood
flowing into Thungabhadra river.

987
02:04:33,141 --> 02:04:35,200
I'm giving you one more day's time.

988
02:04:35,410 --> 02:04:42,043
If you don't hand over your son
and my fiancee, I'll kill...

989
02:04:43,819 --> 02:04:45,047
What're you watching?

990
02:04:45,620 --> 02:04:49,716
These father & son are cheats.
Beware of them.

991
02:04:50,425 --> 02:04:52,222
He has eloped with my lover.

992
02:04:52,594 --> 02:04:55,563
You'll get punished for
their mistake.

993
02:04:55,931 --> 02:04:59,560
I'll not beat anyone.
I'll kill.

994
02:05:00,101 --> 02:05:01,068
Come on, boys.

995
02:05:05,607 --> 02:05:07,165
Are tickets reserved? - Yes.

996
02:05:07,409 --> 02:05:08,842
Reporting time is
exactly at 3.20 P.M.

997
02:05:10,579 --> 02:05:12,843
Ajay, situation is very serious.

998
02:05:13,081 --> 02:05:16,517
Obul Reddy has warned your father to
hand over you & Swapna in 24 hrs.

999
02:05:16,952 --> 02:05:20,183
Buddy, your father called us to
Police station & interrogated.

1000
02:05:20,388 --> 02:05:21,355
Though we hoarsely cried we don't know,
he never cared.

1001
02:05:21,556 --> 02:05:22,523
Beat us also.

1002
02:05:22,724 --> 02:05:24,851
On one side Police & Obul Reddy's
men on the other side.

1003
02:05:25,060 --> 02:05:26,027
They've swarmed all over the city.

1004
02:05:26,228 --> 02:05:27,525
Our area is out of bounds for us.

1005
02:05:27,729 --> 02:05:29,356
Leave alone taking her to
the Airport.

1006
02:05:29,564 --> 02:05:31,691
Even going out of this neighbourhood
is also impossible.

1007
02:05:31,900 --> 02:05:34,869
I suspect they're watching
all our movements.

1008
02:05:35,070 --> 02:05:36,867
They've influence in the
higher echelons of power.

1009
02:05:37,439 --> 02:05:41,034
I don't have any doubts over it.
We'll be careful.

1010
02:05:47,849 --> 02:05:49,043
Keep these with you.

1011
02:05:49,751 --> 02:05:52,219
Leave this place quietly,
as strangers.

1012
02:05:52,787 --> 02:05:55,051
Give me information about
their movements.

1013
02:05:55,423 --> 02:05:57,391
We'll meet again in the
Airport at 3 PM.

1014
02:05:59,861 --> 02:06:01,886
That girl must leave this place,
at any cost.

1015
02:06:03,765 --> 02:06:06,461
I feel very sad on hearing
about leaving us.

1016
02:06:07,269 --> 02:06:09,567
We had come closer in a
short period of time.

1017
02:06:10,438 --> 02:06:13,066
What're you going to study
in America?

1018
02:06:14,943 --> 02:06:17,776
Don't know! I must decide
after reaching there.

1019
02:06:18,013 --> 02:06:19,241
When will you come again?

1020
02:06:20,782 --> 02:06:21,578
Don't know.

1021
02:06:22,584 --> 02:06:23,915
Will you come back?

1022
02:06:26,821 --> 02:06:27,913
Don't know.

1023
02:06:28,123 --> 02:06:29,920
Can't you continue your
studies here only?

1024
02:06:35,130 --> 02:06:37,758
What? Are you making her to cry?

1025
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:42,258
When she's going to foreign to study.
What's your problem?

1026
02:06:42,470 --> 02:06:43,437
Do you want a lollipop?

1027
02:06:44,506 --> 02:06:47,270
Not only me, even she's crying.

1028
02:06:47,475 --> 02:06:48,601
You see this.

1029
02:06:49,311 --> 02:06:51,609
Do you also want a lollipop?

1030
02:06:52,147 --> 02:06:55,116
That's your talent.
You can make anyone to cry.

1031
02:06:55,317 --> 02:06:58,616
What about your talent, then?
Is it not to understand anyone?

1032
02:06:58,820 --> 02:07:00,947
No, to remain an enigma.

1033
02:07:01,823 --> 02:07:07,784
I mean, I'm going way, ain't I?
Aren't you feeling sad?

1034
02:07:07,996 --> 02:07:10,965
Why should I? It's a happy news.

1035
02:07:12,667 --> 02:07:14,294
I feel very sad.

1036
02:07:17,005 --> 02:07:21,965
To leave you, your house,
your people & friends.

1037
02:07:23,678 --> 02:07:24,804
I'm not able to go away.

1038
02:07:26,948 --> 02:07:32,477
Then, I'm also feeling sad.
You're going away, aren't you?

1039
02:07:33,355 --> 02:07:38,019
There'll be no more chases,
tensions and adventures.

1040
02:07:42,197 --> 02:07:43,824
But, I'll get the National Cup.

1041
02:07:44,766 --> 02:07:46,666
Is it necessary to discuss all this
in these tense moments?

1042
02:07:49,537 --> 02:07:51,004
Your clothes are in this bag.

1043
02:07:52,040 --> 02:07:53,507
I think you didn't eat
anything last night also.

1044
02:07:53,975 --> 02:07:57,001
There're some eatables also in it.
Change quickly & come down.

1045
02:08:06,388 --> 02:08:08,856
We must escape from here before the
security guards change for duty.

1046
02:08:14,396 --> 02:08:15,363
Buddy, phone.

1047
02:08:18,266 --> 02:08:21,531
We're in a fix. Police have found
your hiding place.

1048
02:08:23,571 --> 02:08:24,196
What happened, buddy?

1049
02:08:35,150 --> 02:08:36,708
Buddy, there's only one hour for
the reporting time.

1050
02:08:39,354 --> 02:08:41,219
You take Asha and leave
this place immediately.

1051
02:08:47,429 --> 02:08:48,726
Surrender yourself!

1052
02:08:49,831 --> 02:08:54,564
You've been surrounded by Police.
You can't escape from them.

1053
02:09:02,544 --> 02:09:06,742
Ajay, you don't have any
other option. Surrender.

1054
02:09:07,282 --> 02:09:09,750
What day is today? - Friday.

1055
02:09:10,285 --> 02:09:11,912
I'm not crying, am I?

1056
02:09:12,120 --> 02:09:12,916
Great joke!

1057
02:09:13,621 --> 02:09:16,590
What's going to happen here
every Friday at 1.45 PM?

1058
02:09:16,791 --> 02:09:17,917
You can watch it in few minutes.

1059
02:09:20,462 --> 02:09:21,429
Sit down.

1060
02:10:03,905 --> 02:10:04,963
Ajay, police are after you.

1061
02:10:19,187 --> 02:10:21,951
Sir, it's time for Muslims to offer
prayers, they're going for it.

1062
02:10:22,490 --> 02:10:23,422
It's highly sensitive area.

1063
02:10:23,858 --> 02:10:26,486
If you fire at them and if any
untoward incident happens...

1064
02:10:27,695 --> 02:10:28,753
Then, go & search them.

1065
02:10:53,888 --> 02:10:55,515
Kurnool goons are behind you,
watch out!

1066
02:11:37,599 --> 02:11:39,726
Ajay, Obul Reddy's men are
waiting at Patel Market.

1067
02:11:40,335 --> 02:11:41,734
Police is also there.

1068
02:11:41,936 --> 02:11:43,233
You take to Pattargatti Road.

1069
02:11:55,783 --> 02:11:56,579
Tell me, what's it?

1070
02:12:05,860 --> 02:12:06,952
Hold on the line for a moment.

1071
02:12:07,061 --> 02:12:07,857
Hold this.

1072
02:12:13,635 --> 02:12:15,262
Give me. Give it to me.

1073
02:12:15,837 --> 02:12:16,599
Now, tell me.

1074
02:12:16,804 --> 02:12:18,431
A van is ready near
Begumpet Bus stop.

1075
02:12:25,146 --> 02:12:27,148
Don't take the risk of travelling
long distance on a bike.

1076
02:12:27,148 --> 02:12:28,115
Swapna, come & sit.

1077
02:13:06,788 --> 02:13:08,949
Don't get tensed up.
You'll go away safely.

1078
02:13:09,023 --> 02:13:09,819
Okay?

1079
02:13:34,549 --> 02:13:36,278
How much time do we still
have for reporting?

1080
02:13:36,818 --> 02:13:37,682
40 minutes.

1081
02:13:38,820 --> 02:13:39,946
40 M I N U T E S!

1082
02:13:41,990 --> 02:13:44,788
Okay, 40 M I N U T E S.
What do you want?

1083
02:13:45,159 --> 02:13:46,626
I want to eat that.

1084
02:13:49,163 --> 02:13:52,462
Pani pouri? Have you gone crazy?
It's getting late for the flight.

1085
02:13:53,334 --> 02:13:55,393
We've 40 minutes, haven't we?

1086
02:14:06,581 --> 02:14:07,548
Finish it quickly.

1087
02:14:07,749 --> 02:14:10,047
Boy, serve her quickly.
- Yes sir.

1088
02:14:13,087 --> 02:14:14,281
No, nearby only.

1089
02:14:14,756 --> 02:14:15,950
We'll be there in another 15 minutes.

1090
02:14:16,424 --> 02:14:18,051
Okay. There's absolutely no tension.

1091
02:14:22,597 --> 02:14:23,791
A girl was standing here,
where's she?

1092
02:14:23,931 --> 02:14:25,159
She finished eating and
went that side only.

1093
02:14:50,558 --> 02:14:51,252
Where did you go away?

1094
02:14:53,061 --> 02:14:55,529
Here only... to shop!

1095
02:14:59,067 --> 02:15:00,034
Is it time to shop?

1096
02:15:00,735 --> 02:15:01,702
Will you go away without
informing me?

1097
02:15:01,903 --> 02:15:03,268
Do you know how tensed
I had been?

1098
02:15:03,905 --> 02:15:07,136
You don't seem have the tension which I've.
Is it me or you, who's going?

1099
02:15:09,744 --> 02:15:10,369
For you.

1100
02:15:12,080 --> 02:15:13,945
You missed a match because of me.

1101
02:15:15,416 --> 02:15:20,217
As a remembrance from me, wishing you to
win National Cup this time.

1102
02:15:20,588 --> 02:15:21,213
Knee Cap.

1103
02:15:29,764 --> 02:15:30,731
Is it the time for it?

1104
02:15:33,101 --> 02:15:33,726
Okay, come.

1105
02:15:45,947 --> 02:15:48,745
Swapna, in few hours from now,
you'll be...

1106
02:15:53,788 --> 02:15:58,987
You've a feeling of void and a little
disappointment, haven't you?

1107
02:16:01,129 --> 02:16:02,756
Your face is giving in.

1108
02:16:04,298 --> 02:16:05,526
I don't want you to go
with that feeling.

1109
02:16:06,801 --> 02:16:08,268
So, I've a little surprise for you.

1110
02:16:14,475 --> 02:16:16,602
You had accused me of not able to
understand a woman's heart, hadn't you?

1111
02:16:20,314 --> 02:16:20,871
Look at there.

1112
02:16:46,674 --> 02:16:47,641
My child Swapna!

1113
02:17:02,690 --> 02:17:04,988
It isn't good for them to
stay here for a long time.

1114
02:17:05,193 --> 02:17:06,251
Go and drop them.

1115
02:17:08,196 --> 02:17:11,165
Swapna, it's time for your flight.

1116
02:17:38,559 --> 02:17:40,186
Swapna, this is your passport.

1117
02:17:40,394 --> 02:17:41,759
Take the boarding pass
after going inside.

1118
02:17:43,731 --> 02:17:46,029
Since, yours is a student visa,
there won't be much formalities.

1119
02:17:46,234 --> 02:17:48,099
Your certificates & balance
money are in this.

1120
02:17:48,402 --> 02:17:50,427
Will you buy clothes on
reaching there? Okay?

1121
02:17:50,905 --> 02:17:51,963
I forgot something.

1122
02:17:52,740 --> 02:17:53,707
Oh! I've got it.

1123
02:17:53,908 --> 02:17:55,637
I talked to your uncle last night.

1124
02:17:55,910 --> 02:17:57,434
They'll come to the Airport
to pick you up.

1125
02:17:57,745 --> 02:17:59,713
I've written their phone numbers
here, okay?

1126
02:18:00,248 --> 02:18:01,215
No confusion, isn't it?

1127
02:18:01,916 --> 02:18:03,110
Will you call back on
reaching there?

1128
02:18:03,584 --> 02:18:06,052
Call your father. They'll be
relieved to hear you.

1129
02:18:07,922 --> 02:18:10,720
Will you travel carefully?
You're not a small girl, are you?

1130
02:18:10,925 --> 02:18:12,222
Time is up, get inside.

1131
02:18:19,934 --> 02:18:20,901
Give me the bike keys.

1132
02:18:22,603 --> 02:18:24,468
We must start practice immediately,
we'll go to the ground.

1133
02:18:25,106 --> 02:18:26,004
Come on, get going.

1134
02:18:34,115 --> 02:18:35,013
Swapna, come & sit.

1135
02:19:05,646 --> 02:19:06,442
For you only.

1136
02:19:46,354 --> 02:19:47,981
I can't go away leaving you.

1137
02:19:50,024 --> 02:19:51,218
I'm not able to go.

1138
02:19:52,193 --> 02:19:53,490
I want you.

1139
02:19:55,229 --> 02:19:57,322
I feel like spending all my
life with you.

1140
02:19:58,899 --> 02:20:01,424
I can't cheat myself and go away.

1141
02:20:02,703 --> 02:20:07,504
If you're with me, I'll not be
afraid of anyone.

1142
02:20:08,609 --> 02:20:10,770
I can't say any more.

1143
02:20:12,813 --> 02:20:16,681
I want you.

1144
02:20:33,934 --> 02:20:34,764
Take him away.

1145
02:20:53,587 --> 02:20:55,418
I told you not to get involved
in unnecessary trouble.

1146
02:20:55,623 --> 02:20:56,715
Did you hear my advice?

1147
02:20:56,957 --> 02:21:00,154
At last! What have you achieved?

1148
02:21:01,662 --> 02:21:03,493
You reached up to the finals of
State level championship.

1149
02:21:04,331 --> 02:21:08,165
To help someone you gave up the
game and cheated us.

1150
02:21:09,103 --> 02:21:11,003
Later, you said you'll play
for the Nationals.

1151
02:21:11,205 --> 02:21:11,899
What happened?

1152
02:21:12,306 --> 02:21:14,536
Tomorrow night it's Finals
for National Cup.

1153
02:21:15,109 --> 02:21:16,940
And you're here, behind the bars.

1154
02:21:17,545 --> 02:21:18,341
Aren't you ashamed?

1155
02:21:27,955 --> 02:21:30,617
Aunt, how do I look?

1156
02:21:30,991 --> 02:21:33,289
If I say, I think you'll
hold my hand.

1157
02:21:34,795 --> 02:21:35,762
You said it right.

1158
02:21:36,530 --> 02:21:39,431
I feel you'll cast an evil eye
on my son.

1159
02:21:42,369 --> 02:21:45,861
Whether you behead anyone
or comb your hair.

1160
02:21:46,073 --> 02:21:48,268
You're like your father.

1161
02:21:49,410 --> 02:21:53,403
Stop feeling handsome.
Try to bring that girl to your way.

1162
02:21:54,248 --> 02:21:56,341
Shouldn't we make her a bride?

1163
02:21:56,550 --> 02:21:58,609
Isn't your marriage at
11 P.M. Tomorrow night?

1164
02:21:58,819 --> 02:22:01,447
To keep her away from
committing suicide.

1165
02:22:01,655 --> 02:22:04,021
Try to win her heart. Go.

1166
02:22:16,370 --> 02:22:18,964
What's this? I thought
you'll be crying?

1167
02:22:19,173 --> 02:22:20,299
But you're eating country chicken.

1168
02:22:20,508 --> 02:22:21,702
Why should I cry?

1169
02:22:22,476 --> 02:22:25,377
Yes, I can't bear to see
you cry, can I?

1170
02:22:26,080 --> 02:22:29,516
Will you eat this leg piece for me?
- No. I've finished.

1171
02:22:32,186 --> 02:22:35,622
What gift do you want
for our marriage?

1172
02:22:35,823 --> 02:22:37,017
I'll ask my husband & tell you.

1173
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:41,294
Your husband? - Yes, that man only.

1174
02:22:42,062 --> 02:22:45,361
One who's smart.
Don't you remember him?

1175
02:22:46,066 --> 02:22:47,431
That day in Kurnool.

1176
02:22:47,635 --> 02:22:49,159
...ln Konda Reddy Burge centre.

1177
02:22:49,370 --> 02:22:51,634
Beating you black & blue.
One who had taken me.

1178
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:54,098
Forgot him?

1179
02:22:54,542 --> 02:22:55,566
Is it?

1180
02:22:55,876 --> 02:22:57,537
I left him since he appeared
like a young boy.

1181
02:22:57,745 --> 02:22:58,734
But, he's now caught.

1182
02:22:58,946 --> 02:23:01,005
By now he would've got admitted
into some hospital.

1183
02:23:01,849 --> 02:23:05,546
Oh Reddy! Why would he be
in some hospital?

1184
02:23:05,986 --> 02:23:07,954
One who could take me from you
in our town.

1185
02:23:08,355 --> 02:23:09,481
Can't he come here?

1186
02:23:10,090 --> 02:23:10,988
He'll come.

1187
02:23:11,325 --> 02:23:14,556
He'll take me along with him.
He'll marry me.

1188
02:23:14,762 --> 02:23:16,229
You can also come & bless us.

1189
02:23:16,430 --> 02:23:17,863
Do you've so much faith in him?

1190
02:23:18,065 --> 02:23:22,263
I was with him all these days.
Don't I know his capacity?

1191
02:23:23,837 --> 02:23:25,395
Bloody.

1192
02:23:26,507 --> 02:23:29,999
I planned to have atleast
one woman after marriage.

1193
02:23:30,210 --> 02:23:31,302
Situation isn't favourable to me.

1194
02:23:31,545 --> 02:23:32,671
Hey, come here.

1195
02:23:33,013 --> 02:23:37,177
Come here, I'll show you
my capacity.

1196
02:23:39,153 --> 02:23:41,087
Capacity... Capacity. - Leave me.

1197
02:23:43,824 --> 02:23:45,018
He's always like this.

1198
02:23:45,326 --> 02:23:46,725
He can't stop himself once
he gets into the mood.

1199
02:23:47,494 --> 02:23:49,325
You all go to your rooms
and close the doors.

1200
02:23:49,530 --> 02:23:52,465
You go ahead, son.
- Come... Come...

1201
02:23:59,573 --> 02:24:00,699
Where're you going away?

1202
02:24:01,375 --> 02:24:02,740
You wanted to see my
capacity, didn't you?

1203
02:24:03,043 --> 02:24:06,604
Come, I'll show you my manliness.
- Leave me.

1204
02:24:08,482 --> 02:24:13,852
You're thinking its manliness to
enjoy a woman against her wish.

1205
02:24:14,221 --> 02:24:15,848
That isn't manliness.

1206
02:24:16,090 --> 02:24:18,718
A woman must desire a
man on her own.

1207
02:24:18,926 --> 02:24:23,192
I desire Ajay like that.
He's a real man.

1208
02:24:23,931 --> 02:24:25,091
If you've guts.

1209
02:24:25,499 --> 02:24:27,126
If you're really a man.

1210
02:24:27,668 --> 02:24:29,636
You win over him & marry me.

1211
02:24:30,070 --> 02:24:32,334
Then, I'll accept you as a man.

1212
02:24:32,539 --> 02:24:35,667
If it happens, I'll become
your wife.

1213
02:24:36,610 --> 02:24:39,807
Before that, if you marry me
forcibly like a coward.

1214
02:24:42,616 --> 02:24:44,641
Even if you touch me.

1215
02:24:44,852 --> 02:24:46,376
It won't be you, who'll
appear before me.

1216
02:31:05,065 --> 02:31:06,896
Oh! The bride is feeling shy.

1217
02:31:07,100 --> 02:31:09,000
Let her feel, later on there won't
be anything to feel shy.

1218
02:31:24,284 --> 02:31:25,478
I want him.

1219
02:31:27,020 --> 02:31:28,544
A case has been booked on him.

1220
02:31:29,689 --> 02:31:31,156
I had complained against him.

1221
02:31:32,426 --> 02:31:33,791
I'm withdrawing my complaint.

1222
02:31:35,395 --> 02:31:36,521
I want him.

1223
02:31:47,641 --> 02:31:48,300
Come.

1224
02:32:03,657 --> 02:32:07,525
DCP, are you worried about your son?

1225
02:32:08,161 --> 02:32:11,688
I'm not worried about my son.
I'm worried about you.

1226
02:32:14,668 --> 02:32:15,396
Go...

1227
02:32:24,077 --> 02:32:28,013
What's this? The girl there &
your father here.

1228
02:32:28,215 --> 02:32:29,648
...Are praising you to the hilt.

1229
02:32:30,016 --> 02:32:32,416
Are you such a great man?

1230
02:32:33,353 --> 02:32:35,082
That girl had openly challenged me.

1231
02:32:35,288 --> 02:32:38,052
She promised to marry me
if I win over you.

1232
02:32:38,258 --> 02:32:41,750
So, I'm thinking of killing you
and marry her.

1233
02:32:42,262 --> 02:32:43,251
Do you've a cigarette?

1234
02:32:45,866 --> 02:32:47,800
I think, he knows he's
going to die.

1235
02:32:49,402 --> 02:32:51,131
His last wish,
give him a cigarette.

1236
02:33:01,681 --> 02:33:04,775
Wow! A great place!
Stop the vehicle.

1237
02:33:08,321 --> 02:33:10,448
Boys! Take out your weapons.

1238
02:33:12,826 --> 02:33:13,554
Come boys.

1239
02:33:14,494 --> 02:33:15,961
He had escaped in Kurnool.

1240
02:33:16,663 --> 02:33:19,131
Now, take away any part
you like from his body.

1241
02:33:23,336 --> 02:33:24,963
Did you see classical
film 'Patala Bhairavi'?

1242
02:33:26,006 --> 02:33:27,303
I had seen it 10 times.

1243
02:33:28,008 --> 02:33:30,977
In that film, Sorcerer plans
behead Thota Ramudu.

1244
02:33:32,179 --> 02:33:35,148
But Thota Ramudu beheads the Sorcerer.
- Is it?

1245
02:33:35,849 --> 02:33:37,817
Then, am I the Sorcerer &
he the Thota Ramudu?

1246
02:33:38,351 --> 02:33:40,979
But, it is impossible here.
You're surrounded my men.

1247
02:33:41,188 --> 02:33:42,985
It's my men, who're
surrounding them.

1248
02:33:50,197 --> 02:33:52,495
Any man wearing a white dress
isn't a factionist.

1249
02:33:55,035 --> 02:33:57,833
This isn't Kurnool.
This's old city.

1250
02:34:06,546 --> 02:34:07,410
Cover him up with this.

1251
02:34:10,050 --> 02:34:13,417
Tonight, we're winning
the National Cup.

1252
02:34:15,555 --> 02:34:16,351
Then, what about Swapna?

1253
02:34:17,057 --> 02:34:19,423
If the groom is here.
How'll she get married?

1254
02:34:19,893 --> 02:34:20,860
What shall we do with him?

1255
02:34:21,895 --> 02:34:24,420
Bring him to the Stadium.
He'll watch, our match.

1256
02:34:30,070 --> 02:34:34,200
In few moments from now match between
Andhra Pradesh & Punjab will begin.

1257
02:34:34,574 --> 02:34:40,945
Spectators are welcoming the players
with thundering ovation.

1258
02:34:40,981 --> 02:34:42,107
It's brother, man.

1259
02:34:47,754 --> 02:34:49,779
You must definitely win
the National Cup.

1260
02:34:50,257 --> 02:34:52,316
As a remembrance for you.

1261
02:35:19,953 --> 02:35:23,252
Andhra Pradesh Team's captain
Ajay will take the first bow.

1262
02:35:23,957 --> 02:35:29,759
Starting an assault on the
opponents on the left side.

1263
02:35:29,963 --> 02:35:31,089
He's trying to force his way
into by breaking the cordon.

1264
02:35:31,298 --> 02:35:33,391
With great acumen,
trying to forge ahead.

1265
02:35:39,306 --> 02:35:41,171
True! Obul Reddy isn't in
the Marriage hall.

1266
02:35:42,976 --> 02:35:44,273
Any news?

1267
02:35:44,477 --> 02:35:47,105
I've called everyone I know.
I'm waiting for reply.

1268
02:35:50,817 --> 02:35:53,377
Hey! Ramulamma. - What?

1269
02:35:53,653 --> 02:35:54,449
Where's Reddy?

1270
02:35:55,989 --> 02:35:56,785
Which Reddy?

1271
02:35:56,990 --> 02:35:58,457
That one... Your son.

1272
02:35:58,992 --> 02:36:01,460
Bride groom.
...Obul Reddy.

1273
02:36:01,995 --> 02:36:02,518
Where's he?

1274
02:36:02,996 --> 02:36:04,122
It's getting late for the marriage.

1275
02:36:04,331 --> 02:36:05,958
Priest. - Madam.

1276
02:36:06,499 --> 02:36:08,967
Make her recite hymns.
- Yes, madam.

1277
02:36:44,371 --> 02:36:47,067
Score is Punjab - 28
and Andhra Pradesh - 23

1278
02:36:47,273 --> 02:36:48,763
Andhra Pradesh is behind Punjab.

1279
02:36:51,378 --> 02:36:53,437
Punjab players have caught him.

1280
02:36:53,646 --> 02:36:55,614
They're pushing him behind.

1281
02:37:03,390 --> 02:37:04,015
Come.

1282
02:37:05,058 --> 02:37:05,786
Come...

1283
02:37:08,061 --> 02:37:08,527
Come...

1284
02:37:13,900 --> 02:37:15,527
Ajay of Andhra Pradesh
is disappointed.

1285
02:37:30,750 --> 02:37:31,944
Come here... Come...

1286
02:37:47,434 --> 02:37:49,231
You? Where're you calling from?

1287
02:37:49,602 --> 02:37:52,400
Madam, Jr. Boss's phone.

1288
02:37:55,108 --> 02:37:56,302
Where're you?

1289
02:37:56,876 --> 02:37:59,743
Your brother is searching
entire town for you.

1290
02:38:00,113 --> 02:38:02,479
It's getting late for the marriage.
Come here immediately.

1291
02:38:02,682 --> 02:38:06,379
I'm not coming there,
you bring her here.

1292
02:38:06,820 --> 02:38:08,583
She'll see herself who's a real man.

1293
02:38:08,788 --> 02:38:10,380
You haven't gone mad, have you?

1294
02:38:10,623 --> 02:38:13,353
Look, everyone have assembled here.
It won't be good.

1295
02:38:13,560 --> 02:38:14,925
You come here immediately
and marry her.

1296
02:38:15,128 --> 02:38:16,459
We'll take care of him later.

1297
02:38:16,663 --> 02:38:19,496
Yuck, bloody woman. How could
I be born as your son?

1298
02:38:20,133 --> 02:38:21,930
The girl who challenged
my manliness.

1299
02:38:22,135 --> 02:38:25,002
How can I marry her like a eunuch?

1300
02:38:25,205 --> 02:38:26,729
Bring her here.

1301
02:38:27,073 --> 02:38:30,509
Bloody, I'll show her the
manliness of Rayalaseema.

1302
02:38:32,712 --> 02:38:36,273
Marriage isn't here... there.

1303
02:38:49,496 --> 02:38:52,829
Punjab is safely in winning
position with higher points.

1304
02:38:53,066 --> 02:38:57,969
To bring victory to Andhra with great
support & applause from spectators.

1305
02:38:58,171 --> 02:38:59,798
Ajay takes to the field.

1306
02:39:00,006 --> 02:39:05,467
Punjab players are persistent
to win by catching Ajay.

1307
02:39:41,881 --> 02:39:42,779
Ajay, do it.

1308
02:40:40,707 --> 02:40:41,696
Stop.

1309
02:40:50,183 --> 02:40:52,651
We must decide between ourselves,
who's the real man.

1310
02:40:52,852 --> 02:40:57,812
Hey, I'm telling you confidently
win over him.

1311
02:40:58,024 --> 02:41:00,492
Play a game of Kabaddi
with him.

1312
02:45:00,533 --> 02:45:04,560
Call DGP on phone & tell him every
policeman must be here.

1313
02:45:04,770 --> 02:45:07,762
You would be better sleeping, if you're
awake, you'll do like this only.

1314
02:45:07,974 --> 02:45:10,499
Yes, how can you forget that
we're between people?

1315
02:45:11,544 --> 02:45:13,034
What's this playing politics?

1316
02:45:13,379 --> 02:45:14,505
You'll not be able to do it.

1317
02:45:14,714 --> 02:45:18,013
Move... l'll decide it myself.
Move... - Mother...

1318
02:45:36,302 --> 02:45:39,863
Hey! Foolish Dog
Don't bring it.

1319
02:45:40,373 --> 02:45:42,102
Oh my God!

1320
02:45:42,308 --> 02:45:46,335
Throw it away.
Don't bring it.

1321
02:45:48,114 --> 02:45:48,808
Throw it away.

1322
02:45:50,783 --> 02:45:51,579
Oh my God.

1323
02:45:55,788 --> 02:45:56,812
Throw it away.

1324
02:46:13,806 --> 02:46:15,467
Hey, take out my weapon.

1325
02:46:17,510 --> 02:46:19,978
You've lost your mother and
also your brother.

1326
02:46:21,314 --> 02:46:22,975
If you get tensed up,
you'll lose your position.

1327
02:46:23,349 --> 02:46:26,147
Take it as everything had
happened in your sleep.

1328
02:47:54,774 --> 02:47:58,767
Oh! I'm getting crazy ideas.
- What ideas?

1329
02:48:00,246 --> 02:48:03,409
I feel like presenting you
that moon. - No...

1330
02:48:03,949 --> 02:48:05,712
You're with me, aren't you?
That's enough.
