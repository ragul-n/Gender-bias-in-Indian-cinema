Put the rest in your pocket.

You've taken ten rupees
at the time she was born.

00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:07,866
Are you still charging ten rupees only?

14
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,091
She has grown up but not your fee Jangayya.

15
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,966
How will you earn a better living this way?

Lord Siva knows what I want.

I just hope her wound is healed soon.

a doctor in town about your leg?

Why would someone kill him simply?

Hunger should be blamed
for this murder, sir.

There should come a day
when we arrest hunger.

Enough of your worthless poetry.
Drag him into the jeep!

Okay, sir.
Hey, lift him up.

A prisoner who was to to be
hanged in 4 days is on the run.

Babji had severely injured a
guard on his way out.

Reports suggest a prisoner and
a barber have been interviewed.

Here are the visuals
exclusively for our audience.

105
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:26,091
He is a weird man.

106
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:29,216
He wouldn't talk to anyone
in the initial days.

107
00:09:29,996 --> 00:09:33,758
His silence scared me even when
it was me who had the knife.

108
00:09:34,002 --> 00:09:36,508
He would escape.
Why wouldn't he?

109
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:40,633
The jail's Vaastu itself is faulty.
His room is facing North-West which is air.

110
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:43,091
The jail's wall is facing
South-East which is fire.

111
00:09:43,371 --> 00:09:45,271
Can fire contain the wind?

112
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,591
Babji?? The crime world is
terrified of this name.

113
00:09:49,012 --> 00:09:51,300
He is an epitome of grievous atrocity.

114
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:54,216
Frightening mankind
with his series of murders

115
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,591
Babji was declared a
demon in the society

116
00:09:57,716 --> 00:10:00,300
Thus, being sentenced
to death by the court.

117
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:04,300
Babji was a mystery to the police
despite all his crimes.

118
00:10:04,383 --> 00:10:07,181
But in the rage that he didn't
marry his daughter to him

119
00:10:07,597 --> 00:10:09,494
he killed his uncle and
was nabbed by the cops.

120
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:12,875
Only after this were all
his serial killings exposed.

121
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:20,399
"Is this really a space of freedom?"

122
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:25,976

133
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,883
Prisoner on a death sentence,
Gajulamarri Babji is on the run.

134
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:15,841
He is 6 feet tall, has a
dusky complexion. Aged 25 years.

135
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,091
The reward for catching him is a million.

136
00:11:20,694 --> 00:11:24,133
Do our guys assume people would
go crazily behind him for a million?

137
00:11:24,175 --> 00:11:27,508
That's true actually. People turn
desperate when the fuel prices drop.

138
00:11:27,591 --> 00:11:29,966
Why wouldn't they leave a
million? Wouldn't they hunt him down?

139
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:37,635
"You'd shiver at the sight of
your own shadows following you"

140
00:11:38,074 --> 00:11:42,408
"You'd run with the fear of life"

141
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:46,800
"You chase yourself like a thief"

142
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:50,800
"You try and hide from yourself"

143
00:11:50,966 --> 00:11:56,091
"This game and chase is never ending...
Oh dangerous man!"

144
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:59,425
If such people escape,
how can a woman like me feel safe?

145
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:05,300
I fear to step out of the house as
some rogue might outrage my modesty.

146
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:08,216
No matter what, Babji must be
taken into custody and hanged.

147
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:11,008
Or else, I want Mr.
Narendra Modi to resign.

148
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:12,300
Did I say it the way you want?

149
00:12:12,968 --> 00:12:16,466
"You are a stranger to yourself"

150
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:20,258

your height and weight?"

can't hide your true identity"

That is why it screwed us up.

I'm fighting since an hour??

169
00:14:30,154 --> 00:14:32,508
You remind me of my childhood love.

170

I myself am looking for help.

00:15:01,841 --> 00:15:02,716
Tell me what it is.

178
00:15:03,147 --> 00:15:06,841
Have you seen a short guy
and a fair girl come this way?

179
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:10,341
Who are you looking for first?

180
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:11,883
The guy first??

181
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,758
What's wrong with you, guys?

182
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,091
Why are you behind guys
instead of following girls?

183
00:15:17,258 --> 00:15:19,716
Tell me if you're straight or not?

184
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:21,758
Hey! Just tell us if you saw them.

185
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,508
A few crows, dogs and you two
are the only things I saw on this road.

186
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:30,383
I can see that. You're a
mad dog. He's a hairy one.

187
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:31,800
Get lost, you rabid dog!

188
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:33,183
-Mind your business.
-Hey!

189
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,466
Careful??

190
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:46,800
Stop! Stop sir!
I am begging you, sir. Please stop!

191
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:49,633
Sir please stop.

192
00:15:49,675 --> 00:15:51,883
I am begging you, sir

193
00:15:52,104 --> 00:15:53,425
Thank god! He stopped.

194
00:15:53,816 --> 00:15:54,301
Sir!

195
00:15:54,925 --> 00:15:55,758
What is it?

196
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,966
My sweetheart?? My darling is upset, sir.

197
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,716
She disagrees to cooperate.

198
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:05,925
What can an oldie like me do
to get your darling to cooperate?

199
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,966
By darling, I mean my vehicle, sir.

200
00:16:09,286 --> 00:16:12,300
-Can you be of any help?
-Oh, is it?

201
00:16:17,698 --> 00:16:18,979
You've appeared like
god at the right time.

202
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:23,050
It's not God who is right on time.

203
00:16:23,737 --> 00:16:24,430
It's the lord Yama.

204
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:31,008
Why are you hesitant?
It's not a hangman's noose.

205
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:38,059
[vehicle moves]

206
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,383
I've got to travel 10 kilometers
to get the vehicle parts.

207
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:47,508
It's gonna take some time.

208
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,716
What can I do if it's fate that my
darling should spend the night with you?

209
00:16:52,895 --> 00:16:53,561
Okay, you carry on.

210
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,274
-I will shift the material into the jeep.
-All right.

211
00:16:56,374 --> 00:16:57,508
You wait, I am coming.

212
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:58,800
-Sir
-Yes?

213
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:02,383
Thanks for your rope and time, sir.
I need you to do me another favor, sir.

214
00:17:02,508 --> 00:17:02,943
What is that?

215
00:17:03,134 --> 00:17:05,793
That guy has nowhere to go.
Drop him on your way, sir.

216
00:17:08,758 --> 00:17:11,175
I don't know who he is
or where he has to go.

217
00:17:11,258 --> 00:17:13,091
How can we drop him where he wants to go?

218
00:17:13,216 --> 00:17:15,758
Drop him the minute you are irritated.

219
00:17:18,841 --> 00:17:22,091
I feel irritated seeing him already.

220
00:17:28,976 --> 00:17:31,182
[engine purring]

221
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,335
What's your name?

222
00:17:36,716 --> 00:17:37,925
Where are you from?

223
00:17:41,217 --> 00:17:43,050
You have no name or native.

224
00:17:44,614 --> 00:17:46,341
Can't you speak too huh?

Hey, Jangayya...

228
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,760
-Seems like you are back to work?
-Yeah.

229
00:18:01,085 --> 00:18:02,450
Why don't you find killing
contracts on your own?

230
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:04,947
One right contract will
help you settle down.

231
00:18:06,193 --> 00:18:07,052
I am helpless.

232
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:11,675
I am bound to get such
worthless rogues to court.

233
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:15,758
Are investigation and FIR necessary?
Why not shoot them to death?

234
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:20,008
God gave us the duty of
safeguarding Law and Order.

235
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,175
Never speak degrading it.

236
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,966
You are making good
use of the Law and Order.

237
00:18:26,464 --> 00:18:29,758
I neither get into a business
without profit nor pay for prostitution.

238
00:18:29,974 --> 00:18:30,882
I know that.

239
00:18:31,082 --> 00:18:33,341
Anyways, I always find
you alone. Who is he?

00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:40,016
I am going to court.

243
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:41,741
I'll be back once I am done there.

244
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,099
Okay, sir. Move it.

Yes.

258
00:20:30,341 --> 00:20:35,425
I dropped my ring along with
that piece of paper.

Oh no! There's blood too.

298
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,250
Do you expect buttermilk to ooze out in
the place of blood in case of an injury?

299
00:24:15,591 --> 00:24:18,225
Anyway I don't fear this
wound or your dad. Come on??

I can't do it anymore. I am tired.

to be romancing you, not get violent.

if we dance staying here.

But, you want the offering.

you and a feast to me.

We don't want to travel for free.

Consider it as two tickets.
We will pay you.

00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:29,591
Get down, you rascal!

-Me? A rascal?
-Yes!

00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:35,233
Do you think I am shameless
to stay after what you said?

335

Do you think I am senseless and numb?

I am all of those for real, sir.
Please drop us.

337

By the way, I am not a rascal.
I am a gentleman.

338

Who says that? You face looks cunning.

339
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:49,050
What's in the face, sir?
I'd wear a mask it if you hate it.

340
00:26:49,444 --> 00:26:50,816
But, please don't ask
us to get down here.

you if we stay any longer.

Hey! Who is the girl by the way?

345
00:27:02,193 --> 00:27:04,768
-She's my lover, sir. We eloped from home.
-Hey!

346
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:08,750
You eloped with a girl.
What kind of a gentleman are you?

347
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:11,716
Hey girl! What's your name?

348
00:27:13,046 --> 00:27:14,838
I am Adi and she is Paru, sir.

00:27:15,238 --> 00:27:17,858
Where are you from girl?
What's your father's name?

00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:19,196
[sobs]

351
00:27:19,396 --> 00:27:20,827
Oh no! He made my sweetheart cry.

352
00:27:21,402 --> 00:27:22,791
Would you hurt your
daughter the same way?

353
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,661
I'd break her legs if it were my daughter.

354
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,824
-What if it was your son?
-I'd hack him to death.

355
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:33,549
Aah! Are you a father or a factionist?

356
00:27:35,035 --> 00:27:36,924
It's okay, grandpa.
Consider me your grandson and pardon me.

357
00:27:37,196 --> 00:27:40,563
You might look violent
but you are kind at heart. I know.

358
00:27:41,935 --> 00:27:42,858
J-A-N-G-A-Y-Y-A.

359
00:27:43,389 --> 00:27:44,524
Grandpa's name must be Jangayya.

360
00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:47,103
Grandpa, we'd name our
second child after you.

361
00:27:47,607 --> 00:27:48,708
-Hey, shut up.
-Hush!

362
00:27:49,775 --> 00:27:52,474
He looks like the
guard of Jurrasic Park.

363
00:27:52,776 --> 00:27:55,316
By the way, people grow beard on their face,
why did her grow his face over a beard?

364
00:27:57,678 --> 00:27:58,094
Hey!

365
00:27:59,097 --> 00:28:02,791
You talk too much.
What's your zodiac sign man?

366
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:04,769
My grandpa always said the same thing.

367
00:28:04,991 --> 00:28:06,791
[chuckles]
Hey, shut up!

368
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:08,318
[vehicle starts]
Hush!

369
00:28:13,965 --> 00:28:15,291
Do you have a phone boy?

370
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:16,827
Yeah I've got a TV too!

371
00:28:17,027 --> 00:28:19,443
Come on, sir. Why would
thieves give away visiting cards?

372
00:28:19,725 --> 00:28:22,250
Brother, would you
carry a phone while eloping?

373
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,858
Oh, I asked the monkey king!

374
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:29,666
You don't even know
our signals are tracked.

375
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,791
Jangayya grandpa!

376
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:35,109
Will you make me a promise?

377
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,791
I am all yours, Paru.
A promise is nothing.

378
00:28:38,952 --> 00:28:39,716
Ask me what it is.

379
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,666
I've left my family behind for you.

380
00:28:42,945 --> 00:28:45,416
I've left all my neighbors
for you. So what?

381
00:28:45,656 --> 00:28:48,666
Would you love me so much that
I don't miss them?

382
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:52,916
Paru, I will make sure
you don't miss your family in the day.

383
00:28:53,513 --> 00:28:57,125
Will you make sure I
don't miss mine at night?

384
00:28:57,308 --> 00:29:00,833
Then, we could together
have fun day and night.

385
00:29:03,016 --> 00:29:05,891
You should apologize
first whenever we fight.

386
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:06,848
Isn't that what happens always?

387
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:10,383
You get married to us with love. That
turns out to be a hangman's noose for us.

388
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:13,280
Ain't it brother?

389
00:29:16,675 --> 00:29:19,098
-Sir, are you from the military?
-Yes, bro.

390
00:29:19,298 --> 00:29:20,982
-Is it?
-I'm coming from Rajasthan border.

391
00:29:21,182 --> 00:29:23,109
My wife is going to deliver in a week.

392
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:24,725
That is why I am going home.

393
00:29:25,183 --> 00:29:28,183
We have ordered liquor in Goa.
Foreign whiskey.

394
00:29:28,692 --> 00:29:30,391
But it would be delivered in 3 days.

395
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:33,141
Sir you look handsome
like a full bottle liquor.

396
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,225
You shall have a son
like a quarter bottle, sir.

397
00:29:35,338 --> 00:29:36,266
Thank you, brother.

398
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:38,226
Are you going to the town?

399
00:29:38,426 --> 00:29:39,060
No, sir.

400
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:41,852
A girl from our caste eloped with a guy

401
00:29:42,292 --> 00:29:44,332
who belongs to the caste
of the guy in the backseat.

402
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,350
We have to catch them before
they start a family of their own.

403
00:29:47,568 --> 00:29:48,416
That is our aim.

404
00:29:48,891 --> 00:29:50,516
-So, are you boths friends?
-Hell, no!

405
00:29:50,794 --> 00:29:52,483
We differ in caste,
stature and revenge.

406
00:29:52,866 --> 00:29:54,191
-We are both enemies.
-Yes.

407
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,658
But, you are roaming together?

408
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:59,733
Liquor has turned our
enmity into friendship, sir.

409
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,199
So, alcohol brought you two together.

410
00:30:03,683 --> 00:30:05,321
And what will you do once you find them?

411
00:30:05,521 --> 00:30:10,308
I'll chop the guy who eloped
with our girl into pieces.

412
00:30:10,516 --> 00:30:13,766
I'll sacrifice the girl who trapped
our guy to our village deity.

413
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:16,008
Shut up! You close your
eyes and have chips.

414
00:30:16,743 --> 00:30:17,362
You go ahead sir...

00:31:04,808 --> 00:31:08,225
Were you dreaming?
You were laughing real hard.

418
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:13,600
I dreamt that we got married
and you drowned in confetti.

419
00:31:13,991 --> 00:31:15,890
So, you have already
gotten to drowning me.

420
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:16,734
What?

421
00:31:16,934 --> 00:31:18,966

Why did you scream?

426
00:31:59,862 --> 00:32:02,498
You dreamt of our wedding
night. I dreamt of our first night.

427
00:32:02,698 --> 00:32:04,241
You were getting real wild.

428
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:07,308
You made me scream aloud. Oh my God!

429
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,141
Oh! I won't talk to you.

430
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,291
Take it easy, I was just kidding.

431
00:32:11,703 --> 00:32:13,653
Anyways, I asked you to place
the letter at home. Did you do it?

432
00:32:13,853 --> 00:32:14,556
Yeah, I did.

433
00:32:15,412 --> 00:32:17,797
Here... I also got a photocopy of it.

434
00:32:17,997 --> 00:32:20,241
You should've distributed
pamphlets instead.

What the hell is this?

439
00:32:35,575 --> 00:32:36,439
You keep quiet.

440
00:32:36,739 --> 00:32:40,516
Dad! I came home fearlessly
when I failed 10th grade.

441
00:32:40,783 --> 00:32:42,891
Wasn't it then that I
first flirted with you?

I lost my earrings in 11th grade.

Hey, I dodn't know about the earrings.

444

You were my strength
every time, dad.

But, Adi gives me greater strength now.

446
00:32:56,766 --> 00:33:00,725

gather courage to tell you.

I am leaving with Adi who
loves me more than life.

453
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:23,949
So, shall we leave right away?

454
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:26,856
I hope you'd bless us

with a child in a year.

456
00:33:30,868 --> 00:33:33,074
Now that you mention our

Have you written the letter?

I don't lag the issue like you.

460
00:33:41,445 --> 00:33:43,686
I only have one word to
say. I shoot right at it.

461
00:33:43,886 --> 00:33:44,864
And what did you exactly say?

462
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,126

00:33:54,197 --> 00:33:56,308
And why do you have to
announce about the money to them?

467
00:33:56,456 --> 00:33:57,933
It was you who asked me to read it out.

468
00:33:58,129 --> 00:33:59,775
I asked you to read it.
Not make an announcement.

469
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:03,108
Anyways, you brought money for us.

470
00:34:03,652 --> 00:34:05,141
I've got something for you too.

00:34:05,491 --> 00:34:06,766

-Close your eyes.

in the joy of uniting them.

I'm not trying to kiss him.

I was wondering if I've seen him earlier.

Why do you hit me?

496
00:35:14,133 --> 00:35:15,203

00:36:41,004 --> 00:36:44,521
Adi...

522
00:36:47,321 --> 00:36:49,991
That guy was right
about Earth being round.

523
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,358
How do you feel now Adi?
You aren't hurt, are you?

524
00:36:52,683 --> 00:36:56,391
I am fine, but, where's the
jeep? Where'd the road go?

525
00:36:56,683 --> 00:36:58,933
-Where the hell are we?
-Everyting is here.

526
00:36:59,232 --> 00:37:00,109
Just turn around.

527
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:03,891
Oh! We are right here!

528
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:07,041
Adi, I am really scared. Let's go.

529
00:37:07,439 --> 00:37:09,333
Why are you scared,
sweetheart? I am right here.

530
00:37:09,742 --> 00:37:12,161
Grandpa is wrapping the million prize money.

531
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:12,796
-No.
-Come on.

532
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,516
Both the guys are one and the same.

533
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,857
Same beard...
Ah, yes!

534
00:37:26,194 --> 00:37:29,183
We need to lift him up.
Lend me a hand.

535
00:37:29,429 --> 00:37:33,225
Oh you want me to? Oh! I'll help you
only if you give me half the share.

536
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,479
If not take it easy.

537
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:38,670
-Hey. Get lost man!
-Huh?

538
00:37:38,973 --> 00:37:39,797
-Go.
-Let's leave.

539
00:37:39,997 --> 00:37:40,883
-Wait a min!
-Get up!

540
00:37:41,241 --> 00:37:42,363
-Let's go Adi.
-Please don't cry.

541
00:37:42,737 --> 00:37:43,563
He will get the million.

542
00:37:46,085 --> 00:37:47,251
-Grandpa... Please Grandpa
-Adi

543
00:37:47,491 --> 00:37:49,683
I am yet to get married.
I eloped with the girl I love.

544
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,929
I really need money.

545
00:37:51,129 --> 00:37:53,168
You've retired anyways.
You can run your life on pension.

546
00:37:54,971 --> 00:37:55,951
I don't even hold a job,
grandpa.

547
00:37:56,218 --> 00:37:59,933
I am not sure about my job, but am sure
she'll have kids soon. I will need money.

548
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,041
50-50 or 40-60?

549
00:38:02,658 --> 00:38:03,766
30-70 is final...
Woah!

550
00:38:05,123 --> 00:38:06,658
-Grandpa.
-Hmmm.

551
00:38:07,734 --> 00:38:11,135
Grandpa, I've fought like a
soldier at war to catch him.

552
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,018
There's no way you
old man could find him.

553
00:38:13,286 --> 00:38:14,113
Please, grandpa.

554
00:38:14,313 --> 00:38:14,914
[struggles]

555
00:38:15,401 --> 00:38:16,381
Grandpa...

556
00:38:18,502 --> 00:38:19,558
I got you grandpa!

557
00:38:20,044 --> 00:38:20,877
Now you lift him.

558
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:23,681
Isn't grandpa a veteran weight
lifter? He will lift him.

559
00:38:23,891 --> 00:38:25,864
Lift him up grandpa. Come on...

560
00:38:26,636 --> 00:38:28,481
Use all your strength.

561
00:38:29,236 --> 00:38:31,134
You'll have the power
to lift his finger now.

562
00:38:31,836 --> 00:38:34,053
With some effort,
you will soon lift his leg up.

563
00:38:34,557 --> 00:38:37,702
He will wake up meanwhile.
And then it's your death.

564
00:38:38,076 --> 00:38:40,595
Jangayya grandpa...
You'll be no more.

565
00:38:40,795 --> 00:38:42,372
Why do we need this? Let's go, Adi.

566
00:38:42,572 --> 00:38:43,643
Are you crazy?

567
00:38:43,843 --> 00:38:46,294
When an old man is going mad
for money, what about us?

568
00:38:46,494 --> 00:38:47,516
Grandpa, you carry on.

569
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,850
I don't think he'll wake up.
Do I sing a song to inspire you?

570
00:38:50,088 --> 00:38:55,890
[Le le le song from film Prema Nagar]

571
00:38:57,058 --> 00:38:58,032
What are you looking at?

572
00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:00,933
No one is going to appear
even if you scream out loud.

573
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:02,190
I'm all you have.

574
00:39:03,886 --> 00:39:04,764
All right, I'll give the share.

575
00:39:06,575 --> 00:39:09,124
-Come on, lift him up.
-Oh really?

576
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,641
I don't want 30 percent now.

577
00:39:12,598 --> 00:39:14,005
-I want 50 percent.
-Eh?

578
00:39:14,205 --> 00:39:14,805
50...

579
00:39:15,617 --> 00:39:17,208
Okay. I'll give it.

580
00:39:17,542 --> 00:39:19,910
-Really?
-Yeah, I will.

581
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:21,326
Swear on your grandsons?

582
00:39:22,977 --> 00:39:23,490
I promise.

583
00:39:23,732 --> 00:39:26,110
-Swear on your children?
-I promise.

584
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:28,580
Not just like that! Promise on their lives?

585
00:39:28,806 --> 00:39:31,242
I promise on the lives on all my heirs.

586
00:39:31,691 --> 00:39:35,522
Thank god! Grandpa is on track baby.
Let's get the body into the vehicle.

587
00:39:35,799 --> 00:39:36,708
Do we need this right now?

588
00:39:37,259 --> 00:39:40,058
It's a million bucks! Your dad would've
to go topsy-turvy to earn this.

589
00:39:40,323 --> 00:39:41,220
-Come.
-Come on man.

590
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:48,541
Just like the gifts showered by
relatives to a newly wed couple...

591
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,723
...this is a gift from God to us.

592
00:39:51,114 --> 00:39:52,791
He is the blue print to our future plan.

593
00:39:53,126 --> 00:39:55,125
Hey, can you drive a car?

594
00:39:55,891 --> 00:39:58,391
I've driven a girl till here.
Wouldn't I know to drive a car?

595
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:01,141
I somehow feel really scared, Adi.

596
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,600
-We know nothing about them. Let's leave.
-That is why I made him promise.

597
00:40:05,623 --> 00:40:07,828
His grandsons are so gone
if he alters by his promise.

598
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,224
Hey, madman... I don't even have kids.

599
00:40:11,955 --> 00:40:12,700
What about grandsons then?

600
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:15,258
How on earth will I have
grandsons when I have no kids?

601
00:40:16,902 --> 00:40:20,440
Don't you worry. The old man is kidding.
Comedy, you see...

602
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:22,308
Hey, drive the car.

603
00:40:23,908 --> 00:40:24,759
You go and sit.

604
00:40:37,428 --> 00:40:40,233
Grandpa, you have no kids or family.

605
00:40:40,693 --> 00:40:42,050
Why don't you hike my share?

606
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,063
Let's hand him over to the police first.

607
00:40:45,223 --> 00:40:47,475
You can keep all the
money we get as a reward later.

608
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:49,219
-I can have it all?
-Yes.

609
00:40:49,549 --> 00:40:52,720
Well said, grandpa! You are not
just a grandpa. You are my savior.

610
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:56,400
-You've gone crazy for money.
-Ain't it for our future?

611
00:40:57,202 --> 00:40:58,383
Keep your money. Let me go.

612
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,975
Paru... What the hell!

613
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:04,689
Paru...

614
00:41:05,475 --> 00:41:06,442
Where are you going?

615
00:41:06,766 --> 00:41:09,558
Don't get upset for petty issues, Paru.

616
00:41:09,896 --> 00:41:11,262
You are more fond of money than me.

617
00:41:11,462 --> 00:41:13,022
Everything comes after you.

618
00:41:13,222 --> 00:41:14,943
Whatever I do is for us.
[vehicle approaching]

619
00:41:15,235 --> 00:41:17,216
You don't have to go.
The goons are here for us. Come on...

620
00:41:17,423 --> 00:41:20,574
"Rama Rama Rey...
Oh Rama! Rama Rama Rey"

621
00:41:20,859 --> 00:41:22,381

"They found no other way but to elope"

00:41:55,691 --> 00:41:59,236

to sing welcome" [tyres screeching]

Drive straight...

638
00:42:46,766 --> 00:42:48,916
What the hell are you
saying? Have you gone mad?

639
00:42:50,433 --> 00:42:51,025
Go!

640
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,308

the future son-in-law"

Hey, you guys have been
irking me since morning.

659
00:44:32,118 --> 00:44:35,920
If I ever see you again,
I will get you two married.

660
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,766
This old man is behind the drama.
He will get them married, eh?

661
00:44:40,091 --> 00:44:42,035
Who the hell is he to
get out girl married?

Hey...

00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,833
Hey, idiot! How dare you break
my bottle? I will kill you.

665
00:45:08,068 --> 00:45:11,516
I will chop you into pieces.
That's my bottle.

Do you know how many
grapes are squeezed to fill one?

667
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:19,016
Hey, idiot...

00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:19,622
[punch]

669
00:45:19,922 --> 00:45:21,568
Why are you battling it
out for a bloody bottle?

670
00:45:22,722 --> 00:45:23,811
[slap]
How dare you call it bloody?

671
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:28,024
What do you know about the taste
of wine untouched for years?

672
00:45:28,408 --> 00:45:29,965
It's nectar, man. Nectar!

673
00:45:30,248 --> 00:45:32,272
[sobbing]

674
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:36,300
And you have wasted such nectar.
[slap]

675
00:45:36,647 --> 00:45:37,891
How could you break my bottle?

676
00:45:38,186 --> 00:45:40,069
I will break your head now. You idiot!

677
00:45:42,433 --> 00:45:44,019
Guys, I am done with you two.

678
00:45:45,222 --> 00:45:47,975
I promise to get you bigger
and tastier bottles. Okay?

679
00:45:48,384 --> 00:45:50,807
If you don't, we'll smack you like
we smacked him. Promise!

680
00:45:51,007 --> 00:45:51,851
-Promise.
-Promise.

681
00:45:52,831 --> 00:45:54,174
-Leave him.
-You fool.

682
00:46:00,516 --> 00:46:02,808
Babji is giving me a headache.

683
00:46:02,891 --> 00:46:05,925
Don't get worked up, sir. Someone would
find him for the million rupee reward.

684
00:46:06,533 --> 00:46:08,425
He has to die before that happens.

685
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,222
He will anyways be dead once we find him.

686
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:13,933
Before someone finds him and
before he dies once he's caught...

687
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:15,979
Anything can happen.

688
00:46:20,258 --> 00:46:22,736
He is a headache as long as he lives.

689
00:46:24,049 --> 00:46:25,034
Okay, tell me the deal sir.

690
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,358
What's new to mention?

691
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:29,885
Just the regular...

692
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,101
They are paying a
million if he is caught.

693
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:33,831
Take that million right now.

694
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:36,022
We'll think about the rest
15 once the deal is closed.

695
00:46:36,739 --> 00:46:38,321
Here's his photo.

696
00:46:41,225 --> 00:46:42,529
-You must've seen it.
-Damn!

697
00:46:43,137 --> 00:46:44,983
Reports suggest he is in your area.

698
00:46:45,266 --> 00:46:46,766
The information is right, sir.

699
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:49,983
Both the victim and the killer are together.

700
00:46:51,922 --> 00:46:54,552
I've seen him in hangman
Jangayya's vehicle.

701
00:46:55,011 --> 00:46:56,634
I didn't bother due to the morning rush.

702
00:46:58,186 --> 00:46:59,361
24 hours, sir...

703
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:01,209
Keep the cash ready.

704
00:47:03,421 --> 00:47:04,261
You can relax now.

705
00:47:04,461 --> 00:47:09,829

706

[air flowing]

709
00:47:34,438 --> 00:47:37,007
Do you think he is on internet to search
and find him? He's hiding in the hills.

710
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:38,429
I will call you after
finding him. Hang up.

711
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:42,039
Adi! Someone is coming.

712
00:47:42,298 --> 00:47:44,000
Don't worry, darling.
I will take care of it.

713
00:47:58,285 --> 00:47:59,822
They just got lucky.

714
00:48:00,022 --> 00:48:02,607
Hey! You do not know about me.

715
00:48:02,816 --> 00:48:05,411
You know how many bombs
blasted right in my hand?

716
00:48:05,986 --> 00:48:06,573
Let's go.

717
00:48:07,081 --> 00:48:08,942
Where to? Are we going near that jeep?

718
00:48:09,142 --> 00:48:10,512
Yeah! Ain't our treasure in there?

719
00:48:10,712 --> 00:48:13,095
Forget about that.
Our money is in that jeep too.

720
00:48:13,295 --> 00:48:14,791
Is that 1 lakh in that jeep?

721
00:48:15,249 --> 00:48:18,413
You! How peacefully are you
conveying this dangerous news!

722
00:48:18,816 --> 00:48:22,275
I can earn a jackpot in Rummy
circle game if I have that money.

723
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:23,854
Let's go and search for the jeep.

724
00:48:24,054 --> 00:48:25,341
We don't need money.

725
00:48:25,791 --> 00:48:27,816
We are together. That's enough.

726
00:48:28,145 --> 00:48:28,913
Let's go.

727
00:48:29,216 --> 00:48:29,978
Yeah. Let's go to Birla temple. You sit
on the first stair and I'll take second.

728
00:48:33,233 --> 00:48:34,483
-What for?
-To ask for alms.

729
00:48:34,725 --> 00:48:35,740
Crazy girl!

730
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,566
No one will treat you well
when you don't have money.

731
00:48:38,766 --> 00:48:40,323
Money has great value these days

732
00:48:40,523 --> 00:48:42,668
Money gives us status and reputation.

733
00:48:42,868 --> 00:48:45,294
Money gives satisfaction and everything.

734
00:48:46,608 --> 00:48:48,033
And that world belongs to you baby.

735
00:48:48,329 --> 00:48:50,546
Come! Let us search for the jeep.

736
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:51,197
[motorcycle approaching]

737
00:48:51,566 --> 00:48:52,894
Hey, Ravi! How are you?

738
00:48:53,294 --> 00:48:55,483
Bro! Sister-in-law was suffering with labor
pain. So, aunt took her to the hospital.

739
00:48:55,991 --> 00:48:57,175
-When?
-Just now.

740
00:48:57,827 --> 00:48:59,258
-Give me your bike.
-Here. Take it.

741
00:48:59,466 --> 00:49:01,005
-Put this bag in my house.
-Okay.

742
00:49:01,205 --> 00:49:02,839
I will go to the hospital.
Is it Nirmala hospital?

743
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:04,036
-Take care, bro.
-Okay.

744
00:49:07,252 --> 00:49:13,231
[motorcycle approaching]

745
00:49:16,842 --> 00:49:17,816
Hey, Jangayya!
[groans]

746
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,733
Where is that guy who was
with you in the morning?

747
00:49:21,851 --> 00:49:25,101
He is a most wanted guy.
There's a reward of 10 lakhs.

748
00:49:25,683 --> 00:49:26,325
Do you know it?

749
00:49:26,926 --> 00:49:29,129
We should hand him over to the cops.
DOn't you know it?

750
00:49:29,937 --> 00:49:30,979
Am I not a cop?

751
00:49:32,075 --> 00:49:34,887
Where is he? I got some work with him.

752
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:40,425
Can't you see?
He hit me and ran away.

753
00:49:42,691 --> 00:49:43,983
We can't find him anymore.

754
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:48,075
Law, Justice, Equity, and
Punishment will not help us always.

755
00:49:49,058 --> 00:49:52,029
A philosophy is never strong.

756
00:49:52,241 --> 00:49:54,466
A strong person
doesn't need philosophy.

759
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,108
Try to resist the pain.

760
00:50:05,392 --> 00:50:07,772
-The driver went out to ask for help.
-I can't bear it.

761
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:09,282
I can't hold it anymore.

762
00:50:10,744 --> 00:50:14,127
Try to hold it my dear.
I will check if anyone is available.

766
00:51:08,466 --> 00:51:09,716
Get up and untie me.

767
00:51:10,408 --> 00:51:12,081
-I'll kill you if you don't untie me.
-Hey...

768
00:51:12,683 --> 00:51:16,614
Where would you run?
You cannot escape.

769
00:51:18,547 --> 00:51:22,241
It's not me who tied you up. Adi did it.

770
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:29,516
He is the one who hit me.
He went out to get henchmen.

771
00:51:30,709 --> 00:51:33,750
They'll kill you if they find you.

772
00:51:34,335 --> 00:51:36,026
Go and hide in the jeep. Go.

773
00:51:41,725 --> 00:51:42,575
Someone is coming this way.

774
00:51:45,191 --> 00:51:47,557
Go. Get in!

00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:57,605

777
00:52:05,444 --> 00:52:08,658
Sir... My daughter-in-law
suffers labor pain.

778
00:52:08,934 --> 00:52:10,213
The auto has a trouble.

779
00:52:11,758 --> 00:52:14,596
You have to help us. Please, Sir.

780
00:52:16,991 --> 00:52:19,465
Oh no, no! You are badly hurt.

781
00:52:21,302 --> 00:52:24,163
How could you sustain
such bleeding? Oh no, no!

782
00:52:25,033 --> 00:52:26,404

783
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:31,130

Sir.

786
00:52:46,991 --> 00:52:49,536
Please save my daughter-in-law.

[vehicle starts]

788
00:53:12,591 --> 00:53:13,853
-Does he belong to your place?
-No.

789
00:53:14,866 --> 00:53:16,069
-Is he your relative?
-No!

790
00:53:16,309 --> 00:53:17,214
-Is he your friend?
-No.

791
00:53:17,433 --> 00:53:20,437
Then, he is definitely lucky for us.
Come. Let's go.

792
00:53:22,059 --> 00:53:23,387
Sir!

793
00:53:23,627 --> 00:53:25,114
-Help us with a ride. Please, sir.
-Sorry.

794
00:53:25,274 --> 00:53:26,136
-I have to go immediately.
-Sir!

795
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:29,145
We are badly in need and
we're even ready to fight for it.

796
00:53:29,345 --> 00:53:32,418
But, I don't have that strength to fight
now. You don't look that weak to get hit.

797
00:53:32,618 --> 00:53:36,512
-Why don't you listen to me?
-Sir! We don't have time to talk. Ask!

798
00:53:36,712 --> 00:53:37,853
-Oh God!
-Please, sir.

799
00:53:38,425 --> 00:53:40,454
Get on. He agreed to it. Get on. Come.

800
00:53:41,695 --> 00:53:43,511
Adjust yourself, sir.
We shouldn't trouble women.

801
00:53:44,241 --> 00:53:45,044
Sit on the tank please.

802
00:53:45,825 --> 00:53:47,850
-How long have you been driving, Sir?
-Why?

803
00:53:48,189 --> 00:53:50,708
You got my feet instead
of the gear. Watch it.

804
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:07,076
That's the auto. Go that way.

805

Oh no! Get up. We are almost there.

O God! What have I done?
No one is nearby.

Who will save my daughter-in-law? Oh no!
[coughing]

808
00:54:49,075 --> 00:54:52,548

Come and save my
daughter-in-law. I plead you.

He is inhuman.
He behaves like a monster.

How can it be? This is my place.
I know everyone in this place.

I mean, our place is the same.
We can call it a neighboring village.

Where are you going?

864
00:59:13,445 --> 00:59:17,516
Look at that guy with beard.
He looks like a terrorist.

865
00:59:17,616 --> 00:59:19,644
-We don't want that money. Let us go.
-How can we escape now?

866
00:59:20,091 --> 00:59:21,848
The vehicle is ready
with the key. Let's go.

867
00:59:21,866 --> 00:59:23,453
Will you steal the vehicle?
Aren't you ashamed?

868
00:59:23,733 --> 00:59:25,619
I wasn't ashamed of eloping with you.
Why should I be about the vehicle?

869
00:59:26,133 --> 00:59:28,424
There are many people here.
He cannot harm us. Come.

[indistinct baby cry]
Where are you headed?

871
00:59:35,343 --> 00:59:36,044
Namasthe!

872
00:59:42,758 --> 00:59:43,225
Sir.

873
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:46,271
For the help you have done??

874
00:59:49,358 --> 00:59:50,184
Thanks a lot sir.

875
00:59:55,712 --> 00:59:58,275
Help us a little if you don't mind.

876
00:59:58,925 --> 01:00:02,243
Please drop my mom
and Gowri at my house.

877
01:00:03,591 --> 01:00:05,785
It's not far away.

878
01:00:07,545 --> 01:00:10,921
Vehicles don't come in
this way. So, please!

879
01:00:14,408 --> 01:00:14,847
Okay.

880
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:15,922
Thank you so much, Sir.

881
01:00:16,408 --> 01:00:20,015
And please have dinner at my
place, rest and start in the morning.

882
01:00:20,481 --> 01:00:22,491
Please don't say no. Thank you.

883
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:25,183
Mom! You and Gowri can
come home in the vehicle.

-Congratulations
-Thank you.

886
01:00:33,716 --> 01:00:36,038
-What happened, Sir?
-I'm the father of a baby boy.

887
01:00:36,238 --> 01:00:37,523
-Was he born in this vehicle?
-Yes.

888
01:00:38,383 --> 01:00:39,129
Congrats, Sir.

889
01:00:39,414 --> 01:00:41,964
-You saved the hospital charges.
-Thank you very much. Let's go.

890
01:00:42,153 --> 01:00:42,763
Where to?

891
01:00:42,963 --> 01:00:45,384
-I have a lot of work. I will come later.
-Where? To escape, isn't it?

892
01:00:45,788 --> 01:00:46,950
Come with me.
You can go tomorrow.

893
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:48,037
Listen sir.

894
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:52,675
Listen! You are being chased.
They are very angry. Listen to me.

895
01:00:53,401 --> 01:00:55,014
They will be cursed for
their mistakes. Let's go.

896
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:57,238
Girl! Come in the vehicle.

897
01:00:57,984 --> 01:00:58,573
Get in??

Why are you gloomy?

913
01:02:36,935 --> 01:02:37,773
Forgive me, Gowri.

[infant voice]

915
01:02:39,035 --> 01:02:40,440
I wasn't there with
you when you needed me.

916
01:02:41,408 --> 01:02:42,865
That wasn't your mistake.

917
01:02:44,231 --> 01:02:46,023
Your son wants to see you.

918
01:02:46,615 --> 01:02:48,557
That is why he came out soon.

919
01:02:49,709 --> 01:02:52,174
We could talk like this
as everything went well.

920
01:02:53,876 --> 01:02:54,723
Otherwise..

921
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,883
You are a soldier who
saves millions of lives.

922
01:02:59,786 --> 01:03:02,303
Wouldn't there be just one
person to save your family?

[infant voice]

924
01:03:08,675 --> 01:03:10,316
He is a military guy!

925
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:14,137
Babji would be screwed if I
inform this military guy about him.

926
01:03:14,337 --> 01:03:14,768
'Are you out of your mind?'
[indistinct slap]

927

'You should be thrashed.'

928
01:03:17,158 --> 01:03:18,213
Looks like something is broken already.

929
01:03:21,241 --> 01:03:21,972
-Brother.
-Shut up.

930
01:03:22,916 --> 01:03:23,955
Why did I ask you to stay here?

931
01:03:24,155 --> 01:03:25,313
-Listen Brother!
-What did you do?

932
01:03:25,513 --> 01:03:26,612
Oh this guy? Damn!

933
01:03:27,283 --> 01:03:30,022
What if something happened to them?
My life would've been screwed.

934
01:03:30,311 --> 01:03:31,441
-I should kill you. Wait, mom.
-Leave him??

935
01:03:31,538 --> 01:03:33,076
-Wait mom
-Leave him.

936
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:37,034
How can he be held
responsible for the early delivery?

937
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:40,766
He went out to buy the
cradle. Was it his mistake?

938
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,588
You should understand that anger
brings out the monster in a human.

939
01:03:48,302 --> 01:03:49,863
I couldn't understand my brother's love.

940
01:03:52,256 --> 01:03:53,668
I did a mistake by hitting him.

941
01:03:54,751 --> 01:03:58,886
Be it with love or hatred,
a mistake remains a mistake.

942
01:04:00,567 --> 01:04:01,327
Yes, Jangayya!

943
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:07,240
Sometimes even a tiny
mistake can screw lives up.

944
01:04:10,658 --> 01:04:14,818
So, you parents did not
agree because of caste.

945
01:04:15,028 --> 01:04:15,527
Hmm...

946
01:04:16,546 --> 01:04:18,073
This happens everywhere.

947
01:04:18,366 --> 01:04:23,245
Human has even set foot over the moon, but
is unable to set a foot out of casteism.

948
01:04:24,116 --> 01:04:25,383
Aunty!

949
01:04:25,671 --> 01:04:26,336
What is it son?

950
01:04:26,633 --> 01:04:29,235
-Is it your son in the armed forces?
-Yes, dear. Why?

951
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:31,671
Do you know about Babji?

952
01:04:31,871 --> 01:04:32,611
[laughs]

953
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:34,593
I know that he is our savior.

954
01:04:35,241 --> 01:04:38,414
He looks like a person who practices
witchcraft. He is not a savior but a demon.

955
01:04:39,047 --> 01:04:43,933
-Actually he is...
-Listen! God can take any form to help us.

956
01:04:43,983 --> 01:04:45,415
He came in the form of folly to you.

957
01:04:46,491 --> 01:04:49,436
He has become the light of our home today.

958
01:04:51,362 --> 01:04:52,078
I'll be right back.

959
01:04:54,158 --> 01:04:55,625
Light of your home!

960
01:04:56,203 --> 01:04:57,784
He'll torch your home.

961
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:58,714
Go??

962
01:04:59,533 --> 01:05:02,281
But he'd pay for all my bills!
What do you say, Paru?

963
01:05:02,508 --> 01:05:04,918
-Can't you remain silent at all?
-I will be silent.

964
01:05:05,118 --> 01:05:07,475
What will you do if he kills me?

965
01:05:07,866 --> 01:05:11,320
You seem more worried about death
than the one who is sentenced to death.

966
01:05:11,591 --> 01:05:12,666
I'll obviously be worried.

967
01:05:13,235 --> 01:05:14,779
Am I not here?
Nothing will happen to you.

968
01:05:16,064 --> 01:05:17,753
Can a mouse stop a cat?

969
01:05:19,396 --> 01:05:20,439
Don't be scared always.

970
01:05:21,191 --> 01:05:23,576
He should kill me before he kills you.

971
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:30,100
No evil eyes shall fall upon you.

01:05:30,725 --> 01:05:31,511
[infant voice]

973
01:05:32,381 --> 01:05:38,319
I get goosebumps remembering what
you went through to give him birth.

974
01:05:38,519 --> 01:05:38,598
to get him to this world.

975
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:45,509
What is this? I should be happily
married but am dressing up your injury.

976
01:05:46,158 --> 01:05:48,619
Grandpa, was it the prisoner who hit you?

977
01:05:50,575 --> 01:05:52,020
-Babji bro.
-Yeah?

978
01:05:53,303 --> 01:05:54,518
Adi is not a bad guy.

979
01:05:55,407 --> 01:05:59,217
His talk is a bit irritable,
but he has a kind heart.

980
01:06:00,075 --> 01:06:03,378
Don't hold a grudge on him
just because he hit you.

981
01:06:04,938 --> 01:06:06,100
If something happens to him...

982
01:06:06,165 --> 01:06:08,611
[gasps]

983
01:06:08,811 --> 01:06:10,431

Mom! Serve me some ridge gourd.

986
01:06:29,405 --> 01:06:30,794
But you don't like it son!

987
01:06:32,972 --> 01:06:34,051
Younger brother likes it, doesn't he?

988
01:06:41,175 --> 01:06:42,446
I know where he'd be.

989
01:06:50,136 --> 01:06:54,370
You can cover up some
mistakes. But, not every mistake.

990
01:06:56,253 --> 01:06:57,932
Anyway, it's common to make mistakes.

991
01:06:59,733 --> 01:07:03,525
It's wrong if we do not
repent for our mistakes.

992
01:07:04,042 --> 01:07:06,096
Running away from it is a mistake.

993
01:07:06,891 --> 01:07:08,220
So, do you say running away a mistake?

994
01:07:10,011 --> 01:07:13,369
-No one can run away from their heart.
-Not everyone has a heart.

995
01:07:16,721 --> 01:07:21,131
Every human has a heart
and good or bad in it.

the attraction ill has.

That's enough.

1000
01:07:37,548 --> 01:07:38,293
No it isn't.

1001
01:07:43,625 --> 01:07:45,548
For the help you did to us today...

1002
01:07:45,923 --> 01:07:48,742
...my life served on a plate is less too.

1003
01:07:51,263 --> 01:07:52,601
What's so great about his help?

1004
01:07:54,146 --> 01:07:56,049
There's nothing called a great help son.

1005
01:07:58,344 --> 01:07:59,654
It's just a great heart!

1006
01:08:01,818 --> 01:08:06,366
He saved 2 lives in our family
without expecting anything in return.

1007
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:07,926
Two? Are they twins?

1008

1009
01:08:09,508 --> 01:08:12,504
It doesn't mean they're twins.

1011
01:08:16,096 --> 01:08:19,493
Because the mother takes up a new
life after giving birth.

-Take this towel.
-These are my new clothes, sir.

1037
01:10:57,808 --> 01:10:59,312
You have to wear it as
a gift from the child.

1038
01:11:05,283 --> 01:11:05,908
Here brother.

1039
01:11:10,783 --> 01:11:12,611
I don't have siblings.

1040
01:11:13,116 --> 01:11:15,326
You saved me like a brother.

1041
01:11:19,941 --> 01:11:22,457
Take good care of her.

1042
01:11:25,242 --> 01:11:26,752
-See you.
-Take care.

1043
01:11:26,952 --> 01:11:29,134
Sir! I planned to buy
clothes if it was a boy.

1044
01:11:31,774 --> 01:11:32,869
You arrived like a father.

1045
01:11:37,133 --> 01:11:39,719
Please accept these
clothes without denying it sir.

1046
01:11:41,241 --> 01:11:41,735
Please.

Neither do I know your
source and destination.

1050
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:07,462
We accidentally met. But,
there should be a reason for everything.

1051
01:12:08,179 --> 01:12:11,600
I sense a tinge of enemity between you both.

1052
01:12:12,156 --> 01:12:14,263
I don't want to talk too much.

1053
01:12:15,538 --> 01:12:19,583
Whoever asks for an
apology among you is the brave guy.

1054
01:12:20,149 --> 01:12:21,733
The one who can forgive is the strongest.

1055
01:12:22,332 --> 01:12:24,329
Our anger is our punishment.

1056
01:12:24,766 --> 01:12:26,835
Lord Shiva will save and punish us.

1057
01:12:28,943 --> 01:12:31,541
Someone like this young
man should live long.

1058
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:35,658
Lead him on the right path like your son.

1059
01:12:41,928 --> 01:12:42,948
See you, madam!

1060
01:12:44,546 --> 01:12:45,448
See you.

-Yeah.

Stop here. We will get down.

1064
01:13:31,139 --> 01:13:33,047
-See you, grandpa.
-Yeah.

1065
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:34,769
Bless you.

1066
01:13:46,572 --> 01:13:48,210

Let's go.

We got them.

01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:03,622
We found them!

1071
01:14:04,668 --> 01:14:07,488
Hey, wait! Let them finish a round.

1072
01:14:07,788 --> 01:14:08,650
Hey, stupid!

1073
01:14:09,192 --> 01:14:10,168
[slap]
Leave Paru alone.

1074
01:14:13,009 --> 01:14:13,613
You set an eye on our girl?

The show just started. Full of action.
[bashing]

1078
01:14:22,807 --> 01:14:27,090
I will record it and share on
Facebook and Whatsapp after this call.

1079
01:14:27,602 --> 01:14:28,546
Show it to everyone.

1080
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:29,717
-Hey wait
-Please...

1081
01:14:29,917 --> 01:14:30,669
What does he have?

1082
01:14:31,009 --> 01:14:32,016
-Where are you going? Stop!
-Adi...

1083
01:14:32,216 --> 01:14:32,991
Hey!

1084
01:14:36,175 --> 01:14:36,728
Good boy.

1085
01:14:38,341 --> 01:14:40,167
Leave him??

1086
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:42,274

Hey, stop it.

1087
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,389
-Hey!
-Adi!

1088
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:47,280
If you hit me again.
[snapping]

1089
01:14:48,033 --> 01:14:48,821
I'll die.

1090
01:14:49,466 --> 01:14:51,288
I plead you. Will you kill me?

1091
01:14:52,432 --> 01:14:54,803
Why did you get such hefty men to hit me?

1092
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:56,281
Hey!

1093
01:14:56,766 --> 01:14:58,601
Stop man!
Let's discuss and settle it.

1094
01:14:58,950 --> 01:15:00,086
-Follow me.
-Let's go.

1095
01:15:06,997 --> 01:15:09,736
Don't worry, dear.

1096
01:15:10,650 --> 01:15:11,732
Nothing will happen to Aadhi.

Are you in a que before a loo? Turn here.

1100
01:15:28,483 --> 01:15:30,737
Tell me what you get if you hit me.

1101
01:15:30,783 --> 01:15:33,889
We will be respected in our caste
and the other caste gets scared.

1102
01:15:34,521 --> 01:15:35,676
Caste, Respect, Fear!

1103
01:15:35,952 --> 01:15:37,993
What will you achieve with them?
Does it fetch a single meal?

1104
01:15:38,491 --> 01:15:41,533
Let me tell you something
that can change your life.

1105
01:15:41,753 --> 01:15:44,952
You don't even have a vehicle to take the
girl. Don't talk about changing lives.

1106
01:15:45,658 --> 01:15:46,121
With this.

1107
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:48,545
Look at this.

1108
01:15:48,866 --> 01:15:50,001
Observe well.

1109
01:15:52,602 --> 01:15:54,718
-It is very nice.
-What's nice in this?

1110
01:15:55,883 --> 01:15:58,399
What are you looking at? Look at this.

1111
01:15:58,934 --> 01:16:00,702
Come and see.

1112
01:16:01,175 --> 01:16:03,510
We can see that anytime. Turn it.

1113
01:16:04,563 --> 01:16:05,094
[chuckles]

1114
01:16:05,194 --> 01:16:06,907
-Is your wife out of the station?
-Yes.

1115
01:16:06,947 --> 01:16:09,954
That's evident. Idiot!
This is the important thing. See it.

1116
01:16:10,154 --> 01:16:10,807
Did you see?

1117
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:13,960
-Yeah??
-Look at that guy near the vehicle.

1118
01:16:14,358 --> 01:16:16,932
Did you see someone like a love failure?

1119
01:16:17,258 --> 01:16:18,765
-Yes. We can see him.
-Shh!

1120
01:16:19,538 --> 01:16:21,723
Why are you shouting like buffalloes?
Keep it low!

1121
01:16:22,445 --> 01:16:24,368
-He is the one in the pic.
-Oh!

1122
01:16:24,568 --> 01:16:26,405
He is a prisoner who
escaped from the prison.

1123
01:16:26,970 --> 01:16:30,020
There's reward money of 10 lakhs
if you hand him over to the cops.

1124
01:16:30,275 --> 01:16:31,350
I will give that money to you.

1125
01:16:32,403 --> 01:16:33,880
-Do we get everything?
-No, dude!

1126
01:16:34,177 --> 01:16:36,169
I'll share it with the chief
ministers of the states.

1127
01:16:36,726 --> 01:16:38,916
-That's ours.
-Will they give us cash or cheque?

1128
01:16:39,145 --> 01:16:40,194
That depends on you.

1129
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:45,178
It is your wish if it is in
cheque or cash, legal or not.

1130
01:16:45,932 --> 01:16:48,462
-But, there shouldn't be any discrimination.
-No??

1131
01:16:49,226 --> 01:16:50,896
Discuss it and come to a decision.

1132
01:16:51,153 --> 01:16:53,396
I'll go and get him in the vehicle.

1133
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:55,765
-Yeah, okay...
-Move please!

1134
01:16:55,947 --> 01:16:57,948
-Sir is so good!
-Yes man.

1135
01:16:58,383 --> 01:17:01,270
Sir?? Let's go.
Paru! Get in the vehicle. Come.

1136
01:17:02,575 --> 01:17:03,194
Hurry up.

1137
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:09,124
Her parents are happy at home.
But, we are suffering in this hot sun.

1138
01:17:09,327 --> 01:17:12,037
So, we should share the amount equally.

1139
01:17:12,237 --> 01:17:13,082
[vehicle starts]
Yeah, right.

1140
01:17:13,858 --> 01:17:16,062
He's right though he is young.
[vehicle leaving]

1141
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:18,694
Right! Let us all share it equally.

1142
01:17:18,894 --> 01:17:19,894
-Yes
-I agree.

1143
01:17:20,658 --> 01:17:22,796
Guys! They are escaping.

1144
01:17:23,075 --> 01:17:24,793
No! He went to
get the reward money.

1145
01:17:25,334 --> 01:17:28,859
Is it? He is escaping and
you expect money to play cards?

1146
01:17:29,152 --> 01:17:31,416
Wake up man! Go and get him!

1147
01:17:31,616 --> 01:17:33,740
-Let's go.
-Start the vehicle.

1148
01:17:36,783 --> 01:17:38,698
Adi! What did you tell them?

1149
01:17:41,903 --> 01:17:43,663
I told them that we get 10 lakhs
if we hand you over to the cops.

1150
01:17:43,871 --> 01:17:45,872
I said I will give
the money to them.

1151
01:17:46,716 --> 01:17:48,231
They left me for money sir.

1152
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:51,838
They're not coming for us but for you.

1153
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:56,778
How can people like
them understand our love?

1154
01:17:57,743 --> 01:18:01,153
That is why I tricked them.

1155
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:05,441
I am brave enough to love but
not strong enough to fight them.

1156
01:18:07,426 --> 01:18:09,257
No other way than this struck my mind sir.

1157
01:18:10,998 --> 01:18:11,503
Sorry, sir

1158
01:18:12,491 --> 01:18:12,906

-Hey!

1164

We are here to get him but not to die.

1165
01:18:40,758 --> 01:18:42,229
And he is a murderer too. Remember?

1166
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:46,353
Hey, Adi! Take out the holy thread.

1167
01:18:50,075 --> 01:18:50,513
Take it out.

Tie the knot. Tie it now!

Hello, uncle! He tied the knot
to Paru. Ask him not to be sad.

1170
01:19:16,476 --> 01:19:18,784
Okay. Our priest just saw his horoscope.

1171
01:19:18,984 --> 01:19:22,680
He has a good future after
marriage. Bring them back safely.

1172
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:25,514
-What about the caste then?
-Caste is nothing before cash.

That's right, uncle.

Did you see him somewhere?

1209
01:22:54,888 --> 01:22:56,012
No, Sir. I haven't seen him anywhere.

1210
01:22:56,283 --> 01:22:58,941
-I asked him.
-I said whatever he had to say.

1211
01:22:58,999 --> 01:22:59,470
Hey!

1212
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:03,100
-What happened, son-in-law?
-Nothing?? Come. I will tell you.

1213
01:23:03,141 --> 01:23:06,283
How can it be nothing?
The cop looks suspicious.

1214
01:23:06,626 --> 01:23:09,366
-You look scared.
-It's nothing. Let's go.

1215
01:23:09,656 --> 01:23:11,583
Hey! Did you see him somewhere?

1216
01:23:12,269 --> 01:23:13,512
Do you mean this boy?

1217
01:23:14,952 --> 01:23:17,908
He is a very good boy.
Tall boy! Great boy!

1218
01:23:18,043 --> 01:23:18,964
He is a life saver!

1219
01:23:19,634 --> 01:23:21,131
-Absolutely.
-Hey, tell me.

1220
01:23:21,658 --> 01:23:23,200
He is a very bad boy.

1221
01:23:23,466 --> 01:23:25,625
Sir, leave it.
We don't know that guy.

1222
01:23:25,932 --> 01:23:26,993
Don't you know him?

1223
01:23:27,193 --> 01:23:29,820
-He is the one who got you married.
-Shh!

1224
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:32,550
-What is that?
-Hey! Are you acting smart?

1225
01:23:32,854 --> 01:23:34,208
Sir! How can you believe a drunkard?

1226
01:23:35,008 --> 01:23:38,875
I'll shoot your head off like a bottle
you rascal. Tell me where he is.

1227
01:23:43,468 --> 01:23:44,066
You are right.

1228
01:23:45,385 --> 01:23:46,299
Death gives redemption.

1229
01:23:46,950 --> 01:23:48,116
Life gives satisfaction.

1230
01:23:49,467 --> 01:23:52,108
If you are destined to live,
ills turn into good...

1231
01:23:53,341 --> 01:23:55,075
Hatred will turn to love.

1232
01:23:55,716 --> 01:23:57,358
Anger will turn to pity.

1233
01:23:58,151 --> 01:23:59,775
Even death will turn into life.

1234
01:24:01,028 --> 01:24:02,451
Life will turn into a burden.

1235
01:24:03,408 --> 01:24:06,991
[chuckles]
You've changed son.

1236
01:24:07,374 --> 01:24:07,953
Yeah.

1237
01:24:10,258 --> 01:24:14,108
I studied about animals.
Can't I understand humans?

1238
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:22,951
[noisy engine]

1239
01:24:23,147 --> 01:24:23,619

1241
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:31,475

1246
01:25:36,585 --> 01:25:37,581
Where is Babji?

1247
01:25:38,122 --> 01:25:38,769
I don't know.

1248
01:25:38,969 --> 01:25:39,444
[slap]
Hey!

1249
01:25:40,716 --> 01:25:43,000
I know that he was in your vehicle.

1250
01:25:43,508 --> 01:25:46,999
I will kill you if you
don't tell the truth.

1251
01:25:47,099 --> 01:25:49,856
Sir. I really don't know.

1252
01:25:51,125 --> 01:25:52,053
[truck halts]

1253
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,941
People find girls on highways.
But, why do I always find you?

1254
01:26:01,616 --> 01:26:05,733
Did the old man get irritated by
your face already? Come, get in.

1255
01:26:10,854 --> 01:26:11,908
[strangling]
Hey!

1256
01:26:12,857 --> 01:26:16,283
I thought to kill just
one. But, I should kill both.

1257
01:26:16,325 --> 01:26:19,075
-It's okay. It's for 25 lakhs!
-Sir I don't...

1258
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:19,975
Tell me!

1259
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:25,241
Sir! I don't know anything.
Leave me. He is not in the vehicle.

1260
01:26:25,366 --> 01:26:26,491
Hey!

1261
01:26:26,825 --> 01:26:27,939
I am telling the truth.

1262
01:26:28,083 --> 01:26:28,555
[bang]

1263
01:26:29,096 --> 01:26:31,710
[groaning]

1264
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:32,539
Hey!

1265
01:26:35,366 --> 01:26:36,700
He is the CI of our area.

1266
01:26:36,825 --> 01:26:39,833
He might die if we don't
admit him to a hospital.

1267
01:26:40,675 --> 01:26:43,458
My vehicle has turned into an
ambulance ever since I helped you. Go!

1268
01:26:44,136 --> 01:26:45,772
Sir, get up. Sir?
[groaning]

1269
01:26:47,917 --> 01:26:48,767
Why did you come again?

1270
01:26:49,283 --> 01:26:50,481
You would die if it wasn't for me.

1271
01:26:54,616 --> 01:26:55,693
You will die anyway.

1272
01:26:57,229 --> 01:26:59,210
Why do they want to encounter you?

1273
01:27:01,255 --> 01:27:05,866
Who wants your life other than law and why?

1274
01:27:07,075 --> 01:27:11,968
They're scared that I might tell
the truth behind my death sentence.

1275
01:27:12,508 --> 01:27:14,643
So didn't you kill anyone?

1276
01:27:17,991 --> 01:27:18,422
I did.

1277
01:27:18,522 --> 01:27:21,605
[train honking]

1278
01:27:22,575 --> 01:27:24,020
I fell in love with Sujatha.

1279
01:27:24,908 --> 01:27:27,720
She got another match
and she hanged herself.

1280
01:27:28,491 --> 01:27:30,585
I hit Sujatha's father in anger.

1281
01:27:31,525 --> 01:27:32,335
He died.

1282
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,186
I surrendered myself in the police station.

1283
01:27:34,783 --> 01:27:37,889
There was a death of a
serial killer that night behind the bars.

1284
01:27:38,533 --> 01:27:41,567
SP made out a plan to save himself.

1285
01:27:42,408 --> 01:27:44,095
They presented me at the
court instead of that prisoner.

1286
01:27:45,116 --> 01:27:46,365
The court punished me with death penalty.

1287
01:27:47,053 --> 01:27:48,366
I was called a maniac by the society.

1288
01:27:51,021 --> 01:27:52,238
Didn't you approach the high court?

1289
01:27:53,862 --> 01:27:57,098
I thought that my death
will unite me with my love.

1290
01:27:59,445 --> 01:28:00,579
Then why are you escaping now?

1291
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:04,020
[laughs]

1292
01:28:04,714 --> 01:28:06,683
Are you afraid of death now?

1293
01:28:10,624 --> 01:28:12,136
Fear neither saves you from death
[train honking]

1294
01:28:13,438 --> 01:28:14,661
nor lets you live.

1295
01:28:25,107 --> 01:28:26,504
A crime has been committed.

1296
01:28:27,936 --> 01:28:29,718
You might not be responsible for it.

1297
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:36,216
But it's completely your responsibility
if you'll remain to be a criminal.

1298
01:28:38,308 --> 01:28:41,777
There are 3 ways faced by a criminal.

1299
01:28:42,825 --> 01:28:46,769
The first one is to get
punished for the crime.

1300
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:50,833
The second is to escape
from the punishment.

1301
01:28:51,991 --> 01:28:57,449
The third is to fight with law and order
about the punishment.

1302
01:28:58,741 --> 01:29:01,266
Whether it is right or wrong,

1303
01:29:02,058 --> 01:29:06,401
We are not sure if the
court's decision is true.

1304
01:29:07,429 --> 01:29:11,410
The only witness for a truth
and a lie, wrong and right

1305
01:29:14,275 --> 01:29:15,364
is the heart itself.

1306
01:29:18,866 --> 01:29:22,136
Do whatever your heart says.

1307
01:29:31,995 --> 01:29:37,939

Jangayya! I felt to do what my heart says.

1312
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:54,908
While cops have announced
reward money and went in search of him.

1313
01:30:55,339 --> 01:30:56,993
It is surprising that
he surrendered himself.

1314

[music]

1315
01:31:10,514 --> 01:31:13,365
There are too many
requests for amnesty of Babji

1316
01:31:13,541 --> 01:31:17,158
to the President from
various organistions.

1317
01:31:20,050 --> 01:31:23,084
The President rejected
Babji's proposal of amnesty.

I didn't understand you.

1322
01:32:02,270 --> 01:32:03,988
I cannot understand your plans.

Do you want to eat something?

Do you want to talk to
someone for a last time?

1331

Whom do we hand over your body?

1332
