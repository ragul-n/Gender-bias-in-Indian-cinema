1
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,114
Thank you, Grace, for that lovely
a cappella version of the National Anthem.

2
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,393
Please welcome to the stage a student
who needs no introduction.

3
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,236
However, she did write one
for me to read to you.

4
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,400
"Today's keynote speaker
holds the highest GPA...

5
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,756
...in the history of Merriwether High...

6
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,039
...as president of Mathletes, Key Club
treasurer, editor of the school paper...

7
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,190
...as well as her own self-published
magazine <i>Womyn With a Y.</i>

8
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,869
Please put your hands together...

9
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,675
...but remain seated
so those behind you can see...

10
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,079
...this year's valedictorian,
Brandy Klark."

11
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,440
Go, Pancake.

12
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,278
Please be quiet.

13
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,079
Our First Lady,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, once said:

14
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,120
"You cannot be both young and wise."

15
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,239
I say, let's prove her wrong.

16
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,711
Get off the stage, virgin.

17
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,876
What a loser.

18
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,759
Thank you. That's great.

19
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,470
Nice speech, spaz. What, you have
like a death wish or something?

20
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,711
- Good chime-in.
- No, I don't have a death wish.

21
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,231
- Amber, be nice to your sister.
- Hey, Brandy. Brandy.

22
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,517
- Hey, Brandy.
- Hey, Cameron.

23
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,158
Killer speech. Really inspirational.

24
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,391
Your hair smells good.
What is it, lavender?

25
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,634
- Who is this? Who are you?
- Oh, hi. Cameron Mitchell, sir.

26
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,595
George, it's Cameron.
Brandy's science lab partner.

27
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,796
AP Chemistry partner.

28
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,996
- He is?
- Yes.

29
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,755
- Dad.
- What?

30
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,957
- It's Cameron.
- Okay.

31
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,589
- Can I talk to you for a second, please?
- Yeah.

32
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,073
So it was really rad
studying with you this year.

33
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,914
I'm so psyched that we'll be
working together at the pool.

34
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,515
- Oh, me too.
- And we're going to Georgetown together.

35
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,310
I mean, you got a full ride.
I got a partial, but whatever.

36
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,756
I think that fate
is trying to tell us something.

37
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,389
Barf. Two nerds in love.

38
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,029
Shut up.
Our relationship is strictly professional.

39
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,669
We're just friends. God, I hate you.

40
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,795
- So sorry, Cameron.
- No, that's okay.

41
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,360
You were saying.

42
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,160
I was just saying that I think that....

43
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,832
- I wanted just to give you this.
- Oh, thanks. Socks.

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,596
Actually, those are slippers,
and they're for your dorm room--

45
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,753
We did it.

46
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,876
Oh, my God.

47
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,350
- The slutty Oompa Loompas.
- Honey.

48
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,194
Can we get out of this family fuck-fest
and go to a party?

49
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,511
Hey, Judge. Hi, Mrs. Klark.

50
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,233
Hey, go fuck yourself.

51
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,400
Dude, you don't give the chick
you're crushing on socks.

52
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,870
- They're slippers, actually.
- Oh, whatever, man.

53
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,919
You give her girly shit,
like perfume or a scrunchie.

54
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,675
Brandy is not a girlie girl.
She's hard to read.

55
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,753
Sometimes I think she likes me.
Sometimes I think she's a robot.

56
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,470
- Oh, I knew it. She's a lesbo.
- She's not a lesbo.

57
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,078
Oh, shit. Just got a page. Let's jet.

58
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,074
- You don't really think she's a lesbo?
- I kind of do.

59
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,199
I have to register,
contact my dorm mate, label my clothes--

60
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,670
And see <i>Beaches</i>. I got it on VHS.

61
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,277
We have to have a special sleepover
to watch it before we leave, okay?

62
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,238
- Special sleepover?
- Yes.

63
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,869
- God, you're so weird.
- Okay, Wendy, "Watch <i>Beaches."</i>

64
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,679
- I'll put it on the list.
- Thank you.

65
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,793
Save money for computer.
That'll take forever. Buy shower shoes.

66
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,917
You know how much bacteria
is in communal showers?

67
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,959
- If you don't bring your own shoes--
- God, stop. Put it away.

68
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,760
Put it away. All right?
You're being a buzz kill.

69
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,074
Okay. Guess it can wait.

70
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,076
I am excited for the all-night
graduation party.

71
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,516
Those Mormons have some
great activities planned.

72
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,595
And I think it's the perfect alternative
to Derrick Bergwill's stupid kegger.

73
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,070
I mean, who needs alcohol
when there's a hypnotist?

74
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,790
Fiona, you missed the turn.

75
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,237
Hey, seriously,
you missed the turn. Hey.

76
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,793
What the H-E-double hockey sticks.

77
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,152
Told you she'd freak. She almost swore.
Better turn around, Fiona.

78
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,471
There is no way
I am turning this car around.

79
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,838
Pancake, I'm taking you to a real party.

80
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,277
Booyah. Class of '93, fucktards.

81
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,554
<i>Drink, drink, drink, drink!</i>

82
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,757
- Party foul!
- You guys suck.

83
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,151
- Dicks.
- Dicks. Hey!

84
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,277
- I'm out of here.
- Let's get our drink on.

85
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,550
Excuse me.

86
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,310
Fiona, my dad is a judge.
He'd be so disappointed.

87
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,989
You know, Brandy,
in Europe there's no drinking age.

88
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,760
Parents give their babies wine and shit.

89
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,958
Twenty-one is, like,
such an arbitrary age, because it's, like...

90
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,554
...you can go to war and die,
but you can't have a little drink now?

91
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,880
Look, you know I hate hypocritical laws,
but, Fiona, you are driving.

92
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,315
Okay, okay, okay.

93
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,551
- I'm throwing this out.
- No.

94
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,679
- Who is that?
- That is Rusty Waters.

95
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,916
We can stay.

96
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:46,079
<i>Chug, chug, chug, chug!</i>

97
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,631
- Yes.
- Here's to pussy.

98
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,118
Oh, God. What is that?
That's disgusting.

99
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,034
Peach schnapps. The only thing my dad
wouldn't miss from the liquor cabinet.

100
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,431
- I'm sticking to beer.
- I'll stick to schnapps.

101
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,038
- I can't feel my legs.
- You're like after-school-special drunk.

102
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,911
Beer should be a food group.
Am I right?

103
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,439
I like being on the top bunk.

104
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,950
- If you fart, I'll kill you.
- Ladies don't fart.

105
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,079
- Don't--
- Except this one.

106
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,832
- Sleep well, drunkie.
- I love you.

107
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,480
- I love you too.
- We love you.

108
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,712
- We're gonna go party now. Bye.
- I've made it to the top.

109
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,157
Guys are gone? It's all good.

110
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,438
Let's play a game. I hide, you seek.

111
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,911
Here's a hint: I'll be in bed.

112
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,356
Hey, who are you?

113
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,519
<i>I know you are, but what am I?</i>

114
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,349
Oh, I should do this more often.
Getting drunk is fun.

115
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,831
Oh, yeah? It's about to get
a whole lot funner.

116
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,517
You mean, more fun.
"Funner" is not a word.

117
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,238
You feel like Marky Mark looks.

118
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,671
Oh, yeah?
How about some good vibrations?

119
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,355
You ready for some more?

120
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,671
Yeah.
As long as you don't have oral herpes.

121
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,160
Wait.

122
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,718
- Who the fuck are you?
- Brandy Klark, valedictorian.

123
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,554
Yeah, you're not who I was looking for.

124
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,913
Nice to meet you.

125
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,798
Why am I so stupid?
What was I thinking?

126
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,239
That it tastes better on the way down
than it does coming up? Jesus.

127
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,036
- Your vomit's the color of Kermit the Frog.
- Why did I say that?

128
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,999
Why didn't I just keep
kissing him back?

129
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,920
Excuse me?
Who the fuck did you kiss?

130
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,912
- Whom.
- Whom the fuck did you kiss, Brandy?

131
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,192
- Whom the fuck did you kiss, Brandy?
- Brandy.

132
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,432
- Whom the fuck did you kiss?
- Rusty Waters.

133
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,559
- What? No.
- Shut up.

134
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,430
- Are you serious?
- I've never felt that way before.

135
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,956
What, horny?
Yeah, welcome to puberty, man.

136
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,520
No.

137
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,314
Like nervous.
Like I didn't know what to do.

138
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,477
I always know what to do. Always.

139
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,792
So you're saying
that you kissed Rusty Waters...

140
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,556
...but you didn't put out?
Are you crazy?

141
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,598
- Or a lesbian.
- No.

142
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,470
I wanted to put it out.
I didn't know how.

143
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,395
What do you mean you didn't know how?
He kisses you, you just kiss him back.

144
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,119
I mean, it's not that hard.

145
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,069
Unless you're good at it,
and then it is hard. Do you get it?

146
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,152
- Wendy.
- I mean his dick.

147
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,871
Guys, this is serious.

148
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,192
The last time I Frenched
was with Jason Swan in ninth grade.

149
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,115
We had to end our relationship because
it interfered with student-council duties.

150
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,000
You could've gone all the way
if you didn't lose your shit.

151
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,755
Can you imagine losing your V card
to a college guy?

152
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,515
- No premature ejaculation.
- He'd hit your G spot.

153
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,878
Yeah, you'd probably come
like three times.

154
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,033
Come where?

155
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,516
- That's an orgasm.
- Really?

156
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,514
You think if I'd been ready
and wanted to and not so drunk...

157
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,195
...had protection and maybe a cute bra,
we could've--?

158
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,794
Fucked?

159
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,194
Yeah. Totally.

160
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,192
You blew, like, a major opportunity.

161
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,512
I mean, there's nothing wrong with being
a late bloomer, Pancake...

162
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,640
...but let's face it,
you're not getting any younger.

163
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,311
- I kissed his nipple.
- What?

164
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,678
I think I sucked on it.

165
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,839
- That's okay.
- But I don't know why.

166
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,071
Hey, could you get me a coffee?

167
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,549
You smell like patchouli.

168
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,000
Good morning. Why is Chip
shaving his legs in the bathroom?

169
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,391
Because he mountain bikes, duh.

170
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,594
- Chip spent the night, sweetheart.
- Chip did what?

171
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,232
He spent the night.
He's going off on some big fishing trip.

172
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,030
- They won't see each other all summer.
- He's following Phish, as in the band.

173
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,590
You gave Amber permission
to have a boy sleep over?

174
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,955
- He's a man.
- In her bed?

175
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,830
Not a boy, it's her fiancé. Where else am
I gonna have him sleep, on the couch?

176
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,391
- Why the heck not?
- How was your little church party?

177
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,470
I wouldn't know.
Fiona and Wendy took me to a kegger.

178
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,599
I got drunk and puked my brains out.

179
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,192
You should probably ground me.
Mom, do we have ginger ale?

180
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,272
- Let me see, honey.
- Dumb-ass.

181
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,591
Are you still drunk?
Don't tell them that.

182
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,998
- Brandy tells us everything.
- Too much, if you ask me.

183
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,595
And we trust her to make
the right decisions.

184
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,400
Or, at least, learn from her mistakes.
Right, honey?

185
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,398
You need to learn how to lie.

186
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,753
She does not need to lie.
In this house, honesty is the only policy.

187
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,792
- That's right.
- There you go, honey.

188
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,429
And we think this hangover
is punishment enough.

189
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,069
You're not even grounding her?
Un-fucking-believable.

190
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,158
- Hey!
- Language.

191
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,634
Sorry I'm late. I experimented with alcohol
last night and puked on my way here.

192
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,672
I had to stop for mouth wash.

193
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,833
- My name is--
- Brandy Klark. Yeah, I remember.

194
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,200
Do you ever wear a shirt?

195
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,832
Very funny.

196
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,832
Man, last night was embarrassing.

197
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,954
You must think I'm some type
of sex maniac or something...

198
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,672
...but I promise you, next time, I will ask
before I strip down and start kissing you.

199
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,679
- Okay.
- Anyway...

200
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,196
...I take it you're here
for lifeguard orientation.

201
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,757
How did you know?

202
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,670
All right, then. Let's go meet the boss.

203
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,358
- This is the pool manager?
- He is sleeping.

204
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,077
Yeah, I can see that.

205
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,516
Excuse me. Sir?

206
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,353
Excuse me.

207
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,194
Hello.

208
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,520
Excuse me. Hi. Rise and shine.

209
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,234
This is.... It's all happ--
It's all happening.

210
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,315
- It's a happy....
- Excuse me. I think you're dreaming.

211
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,474
Please stop. Stop it. Please.

212
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,240
Hi.

213
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,390
- Hi.
- I'm Brandy. Brandy Klark?

214
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,676
- It's orientation.
- She's a newbie. Cut her some slack.

215
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,713
Cut me some slack?
Correct me if I'm wrong...

216
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,715
...but I think we're here to work,
not hang out and get a suntan.

217
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,914
- You guys.
- Hair of the dog....

218
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,357
I can't believe you're drinking that.
Do you know what time it is?

219
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,631
No. I partied on Friday.
What day is it?

220
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,360
- It's Monday.
- Fucking A, man.

221
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,477
All right, I better get to work.

222
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,360
Have at it, newbie.

223
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,637
You expect me to clean up
all that by myself?

224
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,354
- Yes.
- I can help you.

225
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,796
No, you won't.

226
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,638
I was thinking the colors for the wedding,
burnt sienna and turquoise.

227
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,951
- Do they have burnt sienna flowers?
- I don't know.

228
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,794
- Hi, sweetie. Dinner is waiting.
- H i.

229
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,633
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey, sweetie.

230
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,156
- Good evening.
- How was lifeguard orientation?

231
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,396
Humiliating.

232
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,317
My burn-out boss
decided to make fun of me...

233
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,154
...in front of this
incredibly hot college guy.

234
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,394
Shocker.

235
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,311
Mom, when exactly
did you lose your virginity?

236
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,949
On our wedding night.
Pass the potatoes, please.

237
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,840
- George.
- The potatoes, Jean. Please?

238
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,992
- Oh, honestly.
- Thank you.

239
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,319
- Way to go, dumb-ass.
- Shut the front door, Amber.

240
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,160
- Shut the back door, Brandy.
- Not the back door.

241
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,754
- Not the back door.
- What?

242
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,719
There's doors we don't do.
The back door's one of them.

243
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,236
It's the '90s.
You'll have to get with the times.

244
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,518
- Fine, we can get call waiting.
- I'm not talking about call waiting.

245
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,070
I'm talking about Brandy.

246
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,120
She's clearly curious about sex.
I think I should talk to her.

247
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,159
No. No talk.
Your talks do more harm than good.

248
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,280
What's that supposed to mean?

249
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,478
It means, you had a talk with Amber
and look how that turned out.

250
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,831
You put her on the pill
when she was 15...

251
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,277
...and she's been dating,
pardon my French, jerks ever since.

252
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,713
- And now she's gonna marry one.
- You can't blame Chip on me.

253
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,191
Anyway, what do you expect, Brandy's
gonna wait till her wedding night?

254
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,712
It worked for you.

255
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,954
Let's see.
I lost my virginity when I was 15.

256
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,720
- Fifteen?
- No, actually 14, with Francois.

257
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,557
Our exchange student?
But he was so rude.

258
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,840
He always played his stereo too loud.
He never let me in his roo-- Touché.

259
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,755
He had a big dick. Yeah, Francois,
you know, sex wasn't that bad...

260
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,912
...but it didn't get good
until sophomore year.

261
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,152
College, okay, that makes sense.
You're more mature--

262
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,758
High school. By then, the guys had cars.
We would park at Beaver Creek.

263
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,879
Do people still do that,
go to Beaver Creek to fuck?

264
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,073
- How would I know?
- Oh, shit, right. Virgin.

265
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,277
Man, it feels good to finally be smarter
at something than my kid sister.

266
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,595
Loser. Seriously, you wanna pop
that cherry before you get to college.

267
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,114
Before? Why?

268
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,830
Okay, how can I put this in terms
a Mathlete understands?

269
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,034
- Yes, in terms a Mathlete understands.
- I'm fucking trying, okay?

270
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,559
Freshman year is like
one big sexual pop quiz.

271
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,877
- You need to do your homework.
- Homework?

272
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,910
Yeah. God, it's crazy, freshman year.
I fucked my R.A. the first week.

273
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,636
- Wonder what she's up to.
- It was a girl?

274
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,154
Yeah.

275
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,111
Oh, my God,
I have a lot of work to do.

276
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,431
Let's do this.

277
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,958
Okay, Amber...

278
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,873
...let's see what you got.

279
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,231
Titty-- F-word.

280
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,149
"Motorboating."

281
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,314
Uncle Andy has a boat.
That should be easy.

282
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,516
"Teabagging." Must be British.

283
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,034
"Shocker: One who shocks."

284
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,796
Maybe it's some kind of surprise.
"Hand job, blowjob, rim job."

285
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,596
Why so many jobs?
What's a rim job anyway?

286
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,518
Come on, rim job. Not listed.

287
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,030
Guess I will have to ask
the librarian on that one.

288
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,399
And finally, sexual intercourse...

289
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,439
...with Rusty Waters.

290
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,554
Well, let's get to work, vagina.

291
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,880
Here you go.
Have a good day. Bye-bye.

292
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,198
Hello. Welcome to Big Bun.
May I help you?

293
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,353
I decided to lose my virginity
to Rusty Waters.

294
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,394
- You want fries with that?
- No.

295
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,877
- "Finger-banged, sixty-nine"?
- "Titty fuck, blowjob."

296
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,875
- I had no idea that you could be so--
- Sophisticated?

297
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,717
Slutty. There are things on this list
that I haven't even done, Brandy.

298
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,513
This is awesome.

299
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,673
So you're gonna scam on other guys
and then hook up with Rusty?

300
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,117
No offense, but how? You said yourself
he's out of your league.

301
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,192
- I never said that.
- I did.

302
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,750
Okay, yes, he's out of my league now...

303
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,436
...but not once I learn
how to pearl-necklace him.

304
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,680
- Actually sounds really elegant.
- It's not.

305
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:52,269
Anywho, I'm witty, engaging,
smart, well-read.

306
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,592
Once I add "sexually experienced"
to the package, he'll want me.

307
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,956
Plus, you're an untouched virgin.

308
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,555
Yeah. What guy's gonna say no
to a virgin, right?

309
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,189
Thank you.
That's just the encouragement I need.

310
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:15,599
<i>Let us swim! Let us swim!</i>
<i>Let us swim! Let us swim!</i>

311
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,155
Cameron. Cameron.

312
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,395
- What was that about?
- Pool rats.

313
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,916
Get here at dawn,
don't leave till September.

314
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,119
We're cheap daycare
for the neighborhood rats.

315
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,600
- I'm sure it's not that bad.
- Just you wait, newbie.

316
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:48,032
<i>Let us swim! Let us swim! Let us swim!</i>

317
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,997
Hey, guys, get off the--

318
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,950
- See you later, sucker.
- Loser.

319
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,800
Tried to warn you, newbie.

320
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,072
- What the truck, Willy?
- Welcome to the Thunderdome, bitch.

321
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,076
Know what? That's enough. Settle down,
give her a chance to catch her breath.

322
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,677
Hey, come here. You all right?

323
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,232
Come on.

324
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,394
- Now you okay?
- I am now.

325
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,750
Good.

326
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,076
Just a little hazing, newbie.
You're good.

327
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,471
Can't believe
you didn't see that coming.

328
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,429
Hey, guys,
put those noodles down. Hey.

329
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,919
Who did that, the bubbles in the whistle?
I haven't seen that in years. That's funny.

330
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:30,240
Mayonnaise? In my sunscreen bottle?
Come on, guys, I'm not that pale.

331
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,920
You are a true doofus.

332
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,918
She's so stupid.

333
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,432
<i>Poop! Poop! Poop! Poop!</i>
<i>Poop! Poop!</i>

334
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,632
Newbie, poo patrol.

335
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,671
Very funny.
How very <i>Caddyshack</i> of you.

336
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,634
- What did she mean by <i>Caddyshack?</i>
- Don't know.

337
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,110
It's not poop. It's not poop.
I'm getting hazed.

338
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,277
You know what that means?

339
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,477
What is it, you guys, Baby Ruth?

340
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,949
Snickers? It's very convincing, Willy.
I'm impressed.

341
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,234
- Oh, no. She's not gonna--
- Dude, she's gonna.

342
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,436
Get out of my way!

343
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,160
Oh, my God.
I've never seen that before.

344
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,279
That's not even on <i>Faces of Death</i>
or any of that shit.

345
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,830
Shut up!

346
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,313
I fucking like this girl.
That was awesome, newbie.

347
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,479
Both the boys and girls
locker rooms are clean, okay?

348
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,518
It's not really fair
you made me do both.

349
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,798
- Yeah, well, life's not fair, newbie.
- You got that right.

350
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,594
No!

351
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,195
- Brandy, help--
- Not falling for it.

352
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,840
- You really don't know how to swim?
- I hate the water.

353
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,879
- What's wrong with you?
- Don't tell anybody. I'll lose my job.

354
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,720
You should lose your job.
That is so irresponsible.

355
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,157
- I'm gonna call the Parks Department.
- Oh, no, no, no. Hey, hey.

356
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,392
Brandy? Let's not tell anybody.
Let's pretend it didn't happen.

357
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,839
You want me to lie?
My dad is a judge.

358
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,835
Shit, shit, shit. Look, I'll learn, okay?
I'll learn how to swim.

359
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,992
You know what?
Hey, you can teach me.

360
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,039
Seems like something you'd be into.
You're bossy and stuff.

361
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,352
You like to order people around.
Come on, okay? Please?

362
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,432
I can't lose my job, please.

363
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,276
Fine, but I charge $6.25 an hour, cash.

364
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,636
- Shit.
- And no more hazing.

365
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,079
Okay, no more hazing, $6.25 an hour.
Hey, Brandy. Hey, deal.

366
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,432
Deal.

367
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,831
- Okay, that's it, that's it. That's it.
- Hey, come on.

368
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,078
Hey. You're still gonna teach me
how to swim, right?

369
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,029
Brand? Where's your towel?
I need to dry off.

370
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,714
Okay, Pancake,
you made that list like a week ago.

371
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,679
When are you gonna grow a pair
and do something on it?

372
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,196
Lay off, Fiona.
Some people are just slow learners.

373
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,553
I'm not a slow learner. I got a five
on my advanced-placement tests.

374
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,313
Oh, right.

375
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,315
And it just so happens,
I plan on getting...

376
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,871
...finger-banged tonight.

377
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,756
- I think it's finger-blasted.
- No, it's finger-bombed, bitches.

378
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,631
Okay, well, whatever it is,
I'm going to do it tonight.

379
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,073
All right.

380
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,949
Just how exactly
do you know when to do it?

381
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,715
- You'll be like wet and stuff.
- You'll be wet and stuff.

382
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,315
Make sure to tell the guy
how wet you are. They love that.

383
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,437
The guy's gonna be doing
most of the work.

384
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,632
Yeah, but most guys suck at it.

385
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,678
When Ross Peterson
tried to finger me...

386
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,672
...it was like he was digging
for loose change.

387
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,991
Like dimes between couch cushions.

388
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,677
Sounds terrible.

389
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,432
What's up, my bitches?

390
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,313
What happened to your fingers?

391
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,440
Burnt the shit out of them lighting off
some cherry bombs. It's gnarly, right?

392
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,275
Hey. Get in here.

393
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,354
Get it together, Klark.

394
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,230
Women get fingered every day.
It's not that big of a deal.

395
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,517
Come on.

396
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,109
What? You want some?

397
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,720
Yeah, I want some.

398
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,878
I'm such a goof.

399
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,949
All over my shirt.

400
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,070
Sorry.

401
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,391
- Did you just double wash?
- Yeah.

402
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,917
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What? What?

403
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,274
- Oh, my God, do I have beer breath?
- No.

404
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,000
Just let me kiss you back.

405
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,914
Right.

406
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,756
Yeah, I knew that.

407
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,829
Sorry.

408
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,478
I'm winning.

409
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,394
Do you think
I should try and scam with Duffy?

410
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,597
No. Stop.

411
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,598
It's just the wine coolers talking,
man. You can't hold your liquor.

412
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,476
But we have so much history.

413
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,270
You guys dated for like a week
in the eighth grade.

414
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,435
I know, but I think
I just never stopped loving him.

415
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,069
- Sega's my shit.
- I like your shirt.

416
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,075
I love hypercolor on you. So cool.

417
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,838
I'm so wet. Touch me.

418
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,352
I said I'm wet. Finger me already.

419
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,833
I will. Is it shorts or a skirt?

420
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,193
Neither, they're skorts.

421
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,196
Over or under?

422
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,318
- Under.
- You sure?

423
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,800
Yes.

424
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,676
But I'm definitely not calling it a "blast."

425
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,840
Let's call it a "finger bomb,"
emphasis on the "bomb."

426
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,036
Well, how did it feel?

427
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,872
Kind of like an itch you can't scratch.

428
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:05,351
- Look, "How to find your G spot."
- Hey, can I see that? Give it.

429
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,559
Can you watch the pool for a minute?

430
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,356
- Do you guys masturbate?
- No.

431
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,637
- What?
- That's gross.

432
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,071
Really? You've never
touched yourself down there?

433
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,952
- Well, maybe I straddled the couch.
- Only when I can't sleep.

434
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,831
It says here that women should "flick
the bean" as much as the guys do.

435
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,036
"Forty percent of women
never climax during sex...

436
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,113
...because the guy can't find their G spot."
This is a travesty.

437
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,958
Ladies, we must take charge
of our own sexual gratification.

438
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,870
- What the--?
- Get away from me. Get away, perv.

439
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,835
- He put his finger up my ass.
- I have to put "masturbate" on the list now.

440
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,791
I'm not a quitter. I am not a quitter.

441
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,759
Come on, Klark. Come on.

442
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,431
- UVA protection.
- That's right.

443
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,592
- UVP protection.
- Yes.

444
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,877
- Hypoallergenic.
- It better be.

445
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,032
- Waterproof.
- Oh, God.

446
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,078
- Non-greasy formula.
- Yes.

447
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,833
Soothing aloe vera.

448
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,392
Yes! Aloe vera!
Yeah! Aloe vera! Yes!

449
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,755
- Privacy, please.
- Phone call, ass wipe.

450
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,037
Make it quick.
Chip's calling from Vegas.

451
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,672
- What, between lap dances?
- Phish is playing a show there.

452
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,799
- Were you humping a pillow?
- None of your business.

453
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,198
Loser.

454
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,796
Please be Rusty. Please be Rusty.
Please be Rusty.

455
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,353
- This is Brandy.
<i>- Hey, Brandy, it's Cameron.</i>

456
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,989
Oh, hi, Cameron.
I can't really talk right now.

457
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,836
My stupid sister is expecting
a phone call from her idiot boyfriend.

458
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,714
<i>- Fiancé.</i>
- Correction, fiancé.

459
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,156
- Get off the line, Amber.
- Eat me.

460
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,519
- Hurry up, Cameron.
<i>- I was wondering if Brandy wanted to</i>

461
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,469
<i>I mean, if you, Brandy,</i>
<i>wanted to go out on a date.</i>

462
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,558
- Sure. Why not?
- Why not?

463
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,189
- What kind of shit answer is that?
- Be quiet, Amber.

464
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,317
Don't you have a dick to suck
or something?

465
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,156
- Several. Unlike you, fucktard.
- Cluck you, Amber.

466
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,233
Cluck? Say "fuck," you loser.
Get-- No!

467
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,198
- Don't touch me.
- Let go!

468
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,079
Mom!

469
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,233
<i>Shut up--!</i>

470
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,037
Dude, what did she say?

471
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,118
Wait. Why we doing the dance?
Why we doing the dance?

472
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,351
What happened?
The Cam-Cam dancing?

473
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,115
She said yes.
Well, technically, she said "why not."

474
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,280
But you know what, I asked her out on
a date, she said yes and it's a "date" date.

475
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,717
It's a motherfucking "date" date.
You're doing the "date-date" date!

476
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,675
Gonna get his dick all wet.

477
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,355
- What am I gonna wear?
- Not that.

478
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,196
- Why? It's just Cameron.
- It doesn't matter, Pancake, who it is.

479
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,591
You can't keep dressing
like Tracey Gold.

480
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,157
- Do you wanna borrow my new vest?
- Maybe.

481
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,551
No. No. Look.

482
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,073
I rummaged...

483
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,917
...through my aunt's closet...

484
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,158
...and she's a divorcée,
so she's really lonely.

485
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,597
But she dresses like she's 20,
even though she's 30.

486
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,876
Look, right?

487
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,796
- I like that.
- Feel it. It's like half-silk.

488
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,795
- So, what are you guys gonna do?
- I was thinking dry hump.

489
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,390
Oh, God, no.
She meant, where you guys gonna go?

490
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,950
Oh, we're going to the movies.

491
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,594
Forget dry hump.

492
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,912
- Hand job.
- All the way.

493
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,312
<i>Hold on till I absorb some heat.</i>

494
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,518
<i>Some added tang</i>
<i>might please you too.</i>

495
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,758
<i>I'll slide into an ovenfresh bun...</i>

496
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,992
<i>...and I'm ready for your eating fun.</i>

497
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,551
<i>Why don't you try</i>
<i>a juicygood hot dog?</i>

498
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,717
<i>Delicious.</i>

499
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,355
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

500
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,840
<i>Smoking is not permitted</i>
<i>in this auditorium.</i>

501
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,796
My bad.

502
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,877
- How am I doing?
- You're doing really good.

503
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,192
I thought so. I felt some pre-cum.

504
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,319
I was worried I was gonna
have to spit on my hand...

505
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,075
...but you seem to be progressing
quite nicely.

506
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,795
<i>No gumchewing.</i>
<i>No necking and no talking.</i>

507
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,555
Why'd you stop? What?

508
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,156
Excuse me.

509
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,920
Chip, you're in deep shit.
It's been two weeks.

510
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,959
- Is Mom home? It's a medical emergency.
- No. Bye.

511
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,350
<i>- Wait.</i>
- What?

512
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,672
I need your expertise.

513
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,080
I'm listening.

514
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,989
Okay.

515
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,240
- So I'm giving a guy a hand job--
- Now? Gross. Get off the phone.

516
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,750
No, not "now" now.
He's in the theater.

517
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,071
You left him?
You're gonna give him blue balls.

518
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,192
You'll make him sterile. Finish him off.

519
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,353
Ship. But I don't know how.

520
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,831
There's a weird extra skin.
Doesn't look like it did in health class.

521
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,590
What? He's not circumcised?
What are his parents, like hippies?

522
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,992
- I don't know. Will you just help me?
- All right. Calm down.

523
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,800
This is what you do
with the pig in the blanket.

524
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,591
Everything okay?
Did I do something wrong?

525
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,036
- No.
- Are you sure?

526
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,638
Is that butter?

527
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,799
Do something.

528
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,992
- Do you want me to touch you?
- No.

529
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,990
I paid $5 for this. Okay?
They're ruining it.

530
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,671
I love you.

531
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,272
Sorry.

532
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,512
Oh, my God.

533
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,280
My, oh, my.

534
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:40,075
- Make sure you get more SnackWells.
- I got it, honey. Number one on the list.

535
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,118
- Good morning.
- Hi, honey.

536
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,274
Amber. Mother.
Why are some men not circumcised?

537
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,352
Oh, come on. It's 9 a.m.

538
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,672
I think the better question is,
why are men circumcised at all?

539
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:57,514
Now see, most boys become circumcised
at birth, right when they're newborn.

540
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,837
Some parents do it
for religious reasons...

541
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,959
...others do it because they feel
it's more hygienic.

542
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:08,400
But the uncircumcised penis, see that?
See that turtle neck there?

543
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,677
- Mom. I'm eating.
- You should see this too.

544
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,400
You're getting married. That cow neck--

545
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:18,555
- There?
- That is very, very sensitive.

546
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,439
And now if you remove that...

547
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,638
...then you're actually reducing
a man's sexual pleasure.

548
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,239
- That's terrible.
- Isn't that awful?

549
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,392
- Does it hurt?
- That's a good question.

550
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,473
- What's a good question?
- Did it hurt when you got circumcised?

551
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,996
- I'm late for work.
- No coffee?

552
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,356
Bye, Daddy.

553
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,396
Hey, let me get that for you.

554
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,754
Thanks.

555
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,034
It's the least I can do. Watch your step.
You look fantastic.

556
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,830
Miss Chardine. You little minx.
Come here, you. Let me take that.

557
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,912
- Thanks.
- Someone's using her Ab Roller.

558
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,198
Let me tell you something, ladies.
Men have a one-track mind.

559
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,000
Flash a little skin
and they're like putty in your....

560
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,590
Like you're a car.
I'm gonna fill you up with oil...

561
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,513
...or put it all over your body.

562
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,750
No, Willy, I got this.

563
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,432
This will do.

564
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,077
- New suit?
- What, this old thing?

565
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,434
No cuts.

566
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,112
- Ready to rotate?
- Sure.

567
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,511
Might wanna put your top
back on first, though.

568
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,753
Oh, my God.

569
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,520
Well, if it isn't the president
of the Itty Bitty Titty Committee.

570
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,911
Itty Bitty Titty Committee.

571
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,192
You guys, give it back.

572
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,716
I'm the president
of the Itty Bitty Titty Committee.

573
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,032
- You guys, give it back now.
- You look like a little boy.

574
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,034
Oh, my God.
I have bigger boobs than you.

575
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,156
Bet you didn't see that one coming.

576
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,438
Women in Europe go topless
all the time. So deal with it.

577
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,360
- But they have boobs.
- Big deal.

578
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,277
What, Jenna, your kids
never seen tits before? What?

579
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,912
- That chick is crazy.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

580
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,117
I like it.

581
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,193
What do you mean, you like it?

582
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,511
Dad, guess what.

583
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,232
Good, that's it. There you go.

584
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,039
Just blow little bubbles.

585
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,594
Little itty bitty bubbles?

586
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,916
- Fine.
- I can't swim. You're killing me.

587
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,516
- I can't swim.
- You're in four feet of water.

588
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,717
God, you're such a jerk.

589
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,592
You're right, I'm a jerk.

590
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,992
You still have no tits.

591
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,754
- Relax.
- Okay.

592
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,196
If you keep tensing up,
you're gonna sink.

593
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,950
Hey, look at that.

594
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,269
Hey. Hey, I'm floating.

595
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,993
- It's weird, huh?
- Yeah.

596
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,152
It's like the minute
you give up control...

597
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,119
...you just know what to do
without doing anything.

598
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,793
Thought about
taking your own advice?

599
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,360
What's that supposed to mean?

600
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,989
Well, don't take this the wrong way,
but, you know...

601
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,232
...sometimes you can be super bossy...

602
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,871
...and totally annoying
and, you know, kind of a bitch.

603
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,000
You should take it down a notch. Or 12.

604
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,919
I'm sorry.

605
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,833
- I don't mean to come off that way.
- See, that was really good.

606
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,836
It's, like, you were sad and I started
to feel bad for you. Are you crying?

607
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,311
No. God, you just called me a bitch.

608
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,837
See, now you're starting
to bum me out again.

609
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,516
Yo, butt munch.
You want that ride or not? Let's go.

610
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,990
Coming, Amber.

611
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,516
Willy, this is Amber, my sister.
Amber, Willy, my boss.

612
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,515
Hey. Amber Klark. No way.

613
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,154
I was a senior
when you were a freshman.

614
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,831
I thought you were the custodian.

615
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,477
Everybody thought I was the custodian.
So you guys are sisters?

616
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,154
You two are nothing alike.

617
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,198
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

618
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,670
- I'm gonna get my stuff.
- Hurry up, fucktard.

619
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,349
- I don't wanna miss <i>Home Improvement.</i>
- Shut up, Amber.

620
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,070
- You shut up.
<i>- Home Improvement</i>. Hey.

621
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,349
- Howdy, neighbor.
- I'm not your neighbor.

622
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,200
I was doing Wilson,
the neighbor in <i>Home Improvement.</i>

623
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,593
- Whatever.
- Could you give me a towel?

624
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,830
No.

625
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,311
I've been wanting to have this
conversation with you for a long time...

626
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,473
...but I wasn't sure if you were
mature enough to handle it.

627
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:52,120
I lost my virginity when I was 17...

628
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,317
...with Tucker Brooks.

629
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,918
- You mean, I wasn't your first?
- No.

630
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,391
- Was I your second?
- No. We met junior year in college.

631
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,631
- Don't be silly.
- So where did--?

632
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,911
Where did you
and Tucker Brooks do it?

633
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,912
In the vagina,
but that's not important.

634
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,640
No, I meant as in a location.

635
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,551
I assume the vagina.

636
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,756
- Beaver Creek.
- Like in the back seat of a car?

637
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,596
- Mostly.
- I never went to Beaver Creek.

638
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,116
- You didn't?
- No, I told you.

639
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,597
- My first time was with you.
- But you were so good.

640
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,832
Thanks. I read <i>Penthouse.</i>

641
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,316
Why didn't I think of that?

642
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,870
Look at the afro on this snatch.
It's the biggest thing I've ever seen.

643
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,438
Did they not have Nair in the '70s?
Why are their boobs so small?

644
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,791
- Because they're real?
- Weird.

645
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,119
It's the worst feeling.
It's like a tiny boxer is, like...

646
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,391
...boom, one nut, two nut, three--
Just pounding away at your nuts.

647
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,916
What do you think
they're talking about?

648
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,033
I don't know. Stupid stuff.
Probably about their periods.

649
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,960
How much they like chocolate.
Anyway, blue balls is real.

650
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,152
Somebody should do something.

651
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,320
You guys, Rusty just looked at me...

652
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,316
...and then whispered
something to Derrick.

653
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,836
What do you think
they're talking about?

654
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,475
Hey.

655
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,996
- You wanna keep it?
- You want your snorkel back?

656
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,471
- Find out what Rusty's talking about.
- Find out what they're talking about.

657
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,320
- Be secretive, and come back and tell us.
- Done.

658
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,830
- Pronto.
- Fine.

659
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,394
So, Pancake, are you ready
to knock "blowjob" off that list?

660
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,879
I think so.

661
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,670
- There's some really good articles in here.
- I'm not reading.

662
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,000
You should check out page 47.

663
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,511
It says that if a guy
drinks pineapple juice...

664
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,599
...his semen will taste sweet.
Isn't that weird?

665
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,877
I'm playing a set at the Koffee Klatch
this Saturday. You should come.

666
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,590
I know it's not a big venue
like the Moose or anything...

667
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,995
...but a gig's a gig.

668
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,039
- Did you highlight this?
- Brandy, you can't swallow.

669
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,795
- Why?
- Do you know how many calories jizz has?

670
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,357
You must get so much pussy
with that guitar.

671
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,312
Totally.
Why else would I play this thing?

672
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,231
Rusty's playing <i>Cats</i>
at the Moose on Saturday.

673
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,880
<i>Cats?</i>

674
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,797
I love that musical.

675
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,640
If you drink pineapple juice,
she'll give you a blowjob.

676
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,391
You guys want me to get you
some pineapple juice?

677
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,196
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes. Yes, that'd be nice.

678
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,353
- We have to go to that show.
- Hey, Brandy.

679
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,749
Hey, Cameron.

680
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,913
So I would love
to take you out this weekend.

681
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,594
<i>Sleepless in Seattle</i> is playing.

682
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,753
I don't know about you,
but I love anything with Meg Ryan.

683
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,674
Yeah, it sure would suck to miss that.

684
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,309
- See you later, Pancake.
- Bye, guys.

685
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,597
So I'll pick you up at 8?

686
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,909
Laundry delivery.

687
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,190
Whatever.

688
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,954
Don't worry,
I washed your Wonderbras on delicate.

689
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,750
I wasn't sure how to fold your G-strings.
There's not much to them, huh?

690
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,917
That's the point.

691
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:38,555
Right. Your lotion smells really nice.
What is that, vanilla?

692
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,436
Strawberries and cream.
Why are you being nice?

693
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,712
I know how stressed out you are,
planning a wedding and everything.

694
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:49,669
I just thought I should help out
my big sis.

695
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,554
God, you know what? It is stressful.

696
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,952
You've no idea how hard it is
trying to find a hot wedding dress.

697
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:01,273
- Everything is ankle length.
- I know, right?

698
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,957
So, what are your plans
for after this summer?

699
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,392
- I'm marrying Chippy.
- I mean for work, Amber.

700
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,075
You didn't go to college
for your MRS degree.

701
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,879
Planning a wedding is a job.

702
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,760
Besides, after we're married,
Chippy will take care of me.

703
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,550
Amber, a woman needs a man
like a fish needs a bicycle.

704
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,400
You can support yourself.
You don't need a man to do that.

705
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:30,758
- Those things really work.
- And that's why I don't have to.

706
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,995
Yeah. Like that.

707
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,280
I don't understand
why this band is still playing.

708
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,114
Rusty should be up.

709
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,999
I'm gonna find out what's going on.

710
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,389
- Okay.
- Cool.

711
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,396
Excuse me.

712
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,719
Excuse me. Hi.

713
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,634
I know you're singing,
but I don't know who else to ask.

714
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,032
Do you know if Rusty Waters'
Acoustic Experience is on next?

715
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,474
Just nod your head yes.
Are they on after you?

716
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,392
- Was that a yes?
- Get up here.

717
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,712
Oh, my God, Fiona.
Oh, my God. Look over there.

718
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,631
No fucking way!

719
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,317
Oh, my God. Who are you?

720
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,235
H i.

721
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,238
Thanks, Boise. Clinton sucks.
Perot in '96.

722
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,279
Free Tibet, if you're not too busy.

723
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:21,390
And also thank you for the opportunity
for having me dance.

724
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,750
- Good evening, Miss Klark. Judge.
- H i.

725
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,991
- Who are you?
- George, this is Cameron...

726
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,992
...Brandy's study buddy.

727
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,072
- H i.
- So is Brandy ready?

728
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,715
I'm sorry,
I think there might be some mistake.

729
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,920
Classic. Nerd got stood up.
I guess nice guys do come in last.

730
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,634
- You can say that again.
- George, will you give it a rest?

731
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,473
That was 20 years ago.

732
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,520
- So she's not here?
- Oh, jeez, Kirk, come on in.

733
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,080
- Cameron.
- It's Cameron.

734
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,993
Who's Cameron?

735
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:05,713
I'm sure Brandy will be back soon.
Just make yourself at home.

736
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,560
"French kiss, make out...

737
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,918
...finger bomb, no skorts...

738
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,353
...hand job Cameron."

739
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,717
What the hell?

740
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:03,360
Drink up, boys, and follow me.

741
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,030
Why'd they buy us
pineapple juice?

742
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,078
I think they're Mormons, bro.

743
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,512
Look at me, guys.

744
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,240
You might be right.

745
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,959
Bass has four strings, guitar has six.

746
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,716
- The bass covers the lower end of the--
- Okay, shut up.

747
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,758
I'm sorry. I just feel so bad for him.

748
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,632
So wet in here.

749
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,237
Are you gonna come in?

750
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,993
Can't. Dyed my hair this morning.
Can't get it wet for 48 hours.

751
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,632
Well, that's a shame...

752
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,037
...because a hot shower
sounds really nice right about now.

753
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,793
If you ask me.

754
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,000
Oh, senorita, you are so amorous.

755
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:51,633
Your energy is just electric, you know?

756
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:55,550
Life on the road
is so treacherous, you know?

757
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,275
Never would've thought
touring the Pacific Northwest...

758
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,079
...would be so harrowing--

759
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,391
Are you gonna talk
the whole time I blow you?

760
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:06,480
I'm trying to figure this out.
I think I have to breathe through my nose.

761
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,317
- Apologies.
- Thank you.

762
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,838
I'm a musical wordsmith, honey.
Lamenting is what I do.

763
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,839
And telling the troubadour's tale
is what I do best--

764
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,196
Showers.

765
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,836
What the fuck?

766
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,035
Brandy. Who's this guy?

767
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,231
Brandy, answer me.
What are you doing here?

768
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,713
Open your mouth and answer me.

769
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,551
Did it taste like pineapple juice?

770
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:10,634
Shut up. Just shut up. I--
You two just stay apart.

771
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,911
You guys over there,
you guys over here.

772
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:16,558
Dude, these are like little girls, all right?
What were you thinking?

773
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:21,755
Brandy, you're being totally,
totally irresponsible, okay?

774
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,592
That's some good shit, man.
Her dad is a judge...

775
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,433
- ...dude.
- What?

776
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,592
This one, her dad's a judge.

777
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,834
A judge?
Who do you think you are, Lolita?

778
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:47,191
I mean, you lured me in,
you sought me out...

779
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,353
...and then you lie to me?
What's that about?

780
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,356
Oh, that's good.

781
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,399
- I think I just wrote a song.
- To the van.

782
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,755
All right.

783
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:04,110
- That was cool.
- Bye. Love your music.

784
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,110
There's a gate right there.
I don't know why you--

785
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,953
All right.

786
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:13,111
Hey, hey, hey. Girls, I'm not done.
These guys are 10 years older than you.

787
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,630
- What are you doing?
- Oh, my God.

788
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,799
Willy, do you live here?
Are you homeless?

789
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,591
Yes, I'm a homeless American. Stop it.
I shouldn't be seeing you guys like this.

790
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,798
Brandy, what are you thinking?

791
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,231
What would've happened tonight
if I wasn't here?

792
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,993
I think I would've swallowed.

793
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:36,996
- I'm serious.
- I just got that, and that's not funny.

794
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,999
- It's not funny at all, okay?
- Come on, Willy.

795
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,635
Let's see how funny it is
when I call your folks.

796
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,473
- No.
- Okay? Hey. hey.

797
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:48,390
You guys should be at home in bed,
in flannel pajamas...

798
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,320
...not floundering around
in your underwear--

799
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,671
I don't know your number.
I don't know who I called.

800
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:07,197
- What a night.
- You can say that again.

801
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,759
- What are you doing here?
- We had a date.

802
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:16,071
Or were you so busy with your stupid
scam list that you forgot all about it?

803
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,190
Cameron, that's private.
Give that back to me.

804
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:23,271
Cameron. That's private. Give it back.

805
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:28,037
- You cheat on me?
- No. Cheat? We're not even together.

806
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,795
We're not together because
I'm breaking up with you.

807
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,395
You can't break up with me,
we were never going out.

808
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:38,157
Brandy, you gave me a hand job.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

809
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:39,670
No, it's a hand job.

810
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:47,398
- I told you that I love you.
- You meant that?

811
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,599
Brandy, how could you do this to me?

812
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:58,549
I work with you, I study with you,
I fingered you.

813
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:02,316
At any point you could've told me
that you were just using me.

814
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,757
I wonder if I'll ever be able to enjoy
a hand job again.

815
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,357
Cameron, don't say that.

816
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,594
I'm probably gonna have
erectile dysfunction.

817
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,797
Camster.

818
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,715
- It was just a misunderstanding.
- Don't touch me.

819
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,912
I hope you get AIDS.

820
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,078
Cameron!

821
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,760
Welcome to Big Bun.
Can I take your order?

822
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,073
Cameron wants me to die of AIDS.

823
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,437
<i>And can I get a milkshake?</i>

824
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,518
- Come on, we're waiting here.
- Shit. All right, man.

825
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:51,236
I cannot believe he is letting a hand job
come between our friendship.

826
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,471
He should be happy
that you jerked him off.

827
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,030
- Especially with his condition.
- Yeah.

828
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,238
I didn't know he "like" liked me.
How am I supposed to know?

829
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,477
I'm not a mind reader. I'm not a gypsy.

830
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:05,111
- Do you, like, "like" like him back?
- I don't know.

831
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:09,320
It's Cameron.
I don't think about him like that.

832
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,311
But, you guys, he was...

833
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,158
...crying.

834
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,991
- I think I really hurt him.
- Dude, he's just being a little baby.

835
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,720
Guys mess around
and girls just have to put up with it?

836
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,479
- Yeah.
- It's bullshit.

837
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,472
When I sprained my ankle
in gym class...

838
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:28,075
...Duffy square danced
with, like, three other girls.

839
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,072
- He did not.
- I had to sit and watch.

840
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,995
Oh, my God. You broke up
three years ago. Get over it.

841
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,152
It still hurts, Fiona.

842
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:40,639
It's like Gloria Steinem says,
"You're either the virgin or the whore."

843
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:41,836
Well, you know what?

844
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,311
One of those sounds
a lot funner than the other one.

845
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,358
Yeah. The whore.

846
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,194
Maybe this whole scam-list thing
was a stupid idea.

847
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:53,751
No, you can't give up now.
You worked too hard to get to this point.

848
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,799
- You can't back out now.
- Think about all you've accomplished.

849
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,992
You've gotten more action
this last month...

850
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,959
- ...than your entire high school career.
- That's true.

851
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,033
You're right.

852
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,869
I deserve to get fucked by Rusty.

853
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,872
She made a scam list?

854
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:17,030
A list of sexual experiments
to do with guys.

855
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,194
She used me, man.

856
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:23,479
Like she could just jerk me off
without ever even committing.

857
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:28,195
That is terrible. Any old guy?

858
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,511
Oh, he's such a dick, he's such a dick.

859
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,717
- No, he's not a dick, Duffy.
- He is.

860
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,840
- No, he's like one of my best friends.
- I know. Me too.

861
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,997
You have to believe me,
I didn't mean to hurt him.

862
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,629
- I know you didn't.
- Why would I do that on purpose?

863
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,918
- You would never. You're an angel.
- He told me he wanted me to die.

864
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,151
- He's a meanie. He's a dick.
- He's not a dick.

865
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:50,154
But don't worry,
Duffy's here to make it all better.

866
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,071
Why are you referring to yourself
in the third person?

867
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,595
Duffy. Duffy, stop.

868
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,753
What? I just invited you over
to make you feel better.

869
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,159
What's on your neck?

870
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,917
Nothing. Just a little hickey that...

871
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:13,391
...Kitty Randall gave to me
when we dry humped the other night.

872
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:14,596
What's dry hump?

873
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:20,436
It's actually kind of complicated.
I'd have to show you.

874
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,599
- Okay. You can show me.
- You're just gonna let me hump you?

875
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:27,790
Yes.

876
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,276
It's all right. It's all right.

877
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,551
My mother's cats. Mother's cats.

878
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:40,952
- I'm sorry.
- I'm still hard. Let's keep going. Oh, yeah.

879
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,277
- You've never done this before?
- No.

880
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,119
- Feels so good.
- Yes.

881
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,319
- Shut the fuck up.
- No way, dude.

882
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,558
We dry humped last night
all over my room.

883
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:57,316
- She's writing a sex manual or something.
- Sex manual?

884
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,513
All right.

885
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,480
Thank you.

886
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,075
Hey, you got plans tonight?

887
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:16,677
I don't know, Derrick.
Do we have plans tonight?

888
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,519
Sure.

889
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,756
You're so funny.

890
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,590
Walk me to my bike.

891
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,831
I did not say anything.

892
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,790
- Hey, where you going?
- I need some air.

893
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,952
But it's an outdoor pool.

894
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,438
I need air.

895
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,678
Welcome to Big Bun.
May I help you?

896
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,076
Double order of fish sticks,
a large RC Cola...

897
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,960
...and would either of you
like to go out on a date?

898
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,357
- I will.
- Sisters before misters.

899
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:06,037
What? Come on, give me a break.
Brandy doesn't own Cameron, okay?

900
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,398
And she said herself
that she doesn't, like, "like" like him.

901
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,159
So it's an open playing field.

902
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,429
I've never been with someone
who wasn't circumcised...

903
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,035
...and I wanna see if it's as gross
as she says.

904
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,720
I can hear you.

905
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,637
Hello? Hello?

906
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,840
Fiona, I can see you right now.
Is every woman in this world--?

907
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,400
You know what? Forget it. Forget it.

908
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,552
Stupid car won't work.

909
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,990
Let me get this straight...

910
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:49,470
...you wanna go down on me?

911
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:54,875
Yeah, because I just got dumped
because I suck dick at eating pussy.

912
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,271
I just thought that if I practice...

913
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,114
...then I could keep it
from happening again.

914
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,749
It's a lot harder than you think.
I don't know.

915
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,718
You know what? Forget this. Forget it.

916
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,394
You had me at "eating pussy."

917
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,877
You had me at "eating pussy."

918
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:20,074
Right. Okay.

919
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,078
Up a smidge.

920
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,711
Okay, down a tad.

921
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,111
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, right there.

922
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,476
- It's not working.
- Yeah, it's working.

923
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:33,400
- No, it's not.
- Yeah, it's really working.

924
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:36,871
No, it's not.
My video won't play, Derrick.

925
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,800
Was that good?

926
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,789
- Is the TV on channel three?
- Yes.

927
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:47,431
- Well, make sure it's set to VCR, man.
- Okay.

928
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,313
- What you doing?
- Looking for my keys.

929
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,836
You need some help?
I mean, I can always help.

930
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,469
- No.
- I know, buddy, I know. Just get out.

931
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,233
All right, guys.

932
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,439
- I thought we were alone.
- Who, Benji?

933
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:09,959
He doesn't count.
He believes in monsters and shit.

934
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,760
- He's not a person.
- Okay, fine.

935
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:39,519
<i>- Mitchell residence.</i>
- Hello, Mr. Mitchell, it's Brandy.

936
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,000
Is Cameron there?

937
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:44,119
<i>Yeah, I'm sorry, he's in his room</i>
<i>with the door locked...</i>

938
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:47,796
<i>...and he's listening</i>
<i>to Sarah McLachlan.</i>

939
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:51,317
- That bad, huh?
<i>- Yeah. I would tell him you called...</i>

940
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,558
<i>...but we're not saying</i>
<i>your name around here.</i>

941
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,633
Got it. Thanks anyways.

942
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:01,555
It's a three-day rental, so we can watch
it again tomorrow if you want.

943
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,797
I'm glad you talked me into this.

944
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:06,555
- So excited for <i>Beaches.</i>
- Me too.

945
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:10,037
Guys, I brought Kleenex and stuff,
just in case we get emotional.

946
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:14,160
- Yes, Wendy, we know.
- What's after "titty fucked," cunni-what?

947
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:15,800
- Cunnilingus.
- What is that?

948
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,232
It's when a man stimulates
the female genitals with his mouth.

949
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,631
No shit. So Derrick ate you out?

950
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:25,754
Yeah. I prefer "cunnilingus," though.
"Eat out" reminds me of fast food.

951
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:29,392
- Look at you. That's a step away from sex.
- Yeah, I know.

952
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,432
We should celebrate
by watching <i>Beaches.</i>

953
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:33,597
So...

954
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:36,832
...now that you're like hooking up
with all these different guys...

955
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,674
...is it cool if I go out with Cameron?

956
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,431
- What? Cameron asked you out?
- He asked me out too...

957
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:47,115
...but I said no
because you're my best friend...

958
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,875
...and best friends don't let boys
get between them.

959
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,280
Speaking of that, it's time for <i>Beaches.</i>

960
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:54,954
Yeah, <i>Beaches.</i>

961
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:59,592
- Are you pressing the right button?
- I think so.

962
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,797
Did you dry hump Duffy?

963
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,478
- What?
- Yeah.

964
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:08,270
- What?
- He gave me two hickeys. One and one.

965
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:12,639
Brandy.
You know I, like, "like" like Duffy.

966
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:16,470
- So? It's not like you're going out with him.
- So? What is wrong with you?

967
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,793
- Why are you spazzing out?
- Because it's ho's before bros, man.

968
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,189
You don't just go around...

969
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,471
- ...hooking up with whoever.
- Whomever.

970
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,155
You're going out with Cameron,
so don't be a hypocrite.

971
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:30,154
Yeah, but I asked you first.
That's the difference.

972
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:34,872
I cannot believe that you would choose
a boy over our friendship.

973
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,993
- You don't deserve to watch <i>Beaches.</i>
- No, she doesn't.

974
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:42,393
- Don't say that.
- Let's go. Let's watch it at your place.

975
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,950
You guys. It's stuck, Wendy.

976
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,999
- Yeah, thanks, I can see that.
- Take it. Let's go.

977
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,231
- Don't take my VCR.
- Come on.

978
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,952
- Wait. Come back.
- You better hope that tape isn't ruined.

979
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,157
- Fiona, come on, don't be--
- No, I'm sorry...

980
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,996
...I don't understand you
because I don't speak slut.

981
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,991
- Willy, what happened?
- Same shit every summer.

982
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,955
Oak Crest Country Club
pulls some stupid prank on us.

983
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:16,036
- It's an initiation for their new lifeguards.
- I can't believe they did that.

984
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,510
You were here all night
and you didn't hear them?

985
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,353
No.

986
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,876
God, man, Oak Crest,
those guys are good.

987
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:28,675
Yeah.
Yeah, that's a big kick in the nuts.

988
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:31,719
I'll have Rusty and Derrick
put it back up when they get here.

989
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:35,191
What?
No, Willy, we need to get them back.

990
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:41,998
Yeah, we need to get revenge.
I mean, real revenge.

991
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:45,673
- You mean, like--? Like kill them?
- What?

992
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,071
I think that's illegal.
I know a guy with a gun--

993
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:50,670
No, I mean like we need to get them
where it hurts.

994
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,279
Come on, you're our boss, our leader.

995
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,997
This is your pool. If not you, then who?

996
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:59,514
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

997
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:02,400
Let's take a big fucking dump
on Oak Crest.

998
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,233
Let's get those fuckers.

999
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,234
Hey, Bernadette. What's the plan?

1000
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:12,749
We're gonna blow this shit up.
We're gonna burn it to the ground.

1001
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:15,754
- Rock.
- I see it, boss.

1002
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,037
It's a fucking ladder,
it's gonna make noise.

1003
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,715
Go, go, go.

1004
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:30,717
Holy shit. That is a fucking slide.

1005
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:34,280
All right, Cameron. All right.

1006
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:37,437
Nice.

1007
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:41,435
<i>Approaching perimeter.</i>
<i>Cameron, what's your status? Over.</i>

1008
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:45,435
He's not talking to you right now.
Over. Shit, this thing's hot.

1009
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:49,435
You can't let personal issues get in
the way of work. Act professional. Over.

1010
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,799
You can't see him,
but he's flipping you off right now. Over.

1011
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,435
Whatever. Just get into position. Over.

1012
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:01,032
It's fucking scary in here, man.
What are you looking for?

1013
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,953
Just some sort of knob.

1014
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:06,272
Why do they have all these things
in their pool? What does it do?

1015
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,949
- We don't have any of these.
- How do you not know this?

1016
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:10,913
Come on.

1017
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:14,752
Shit, there it is.

1018
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:17,517
<i>All right, we found it. Over.</i>

1019
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:29,433
On my count, guys. In one...

1020
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,159
<i>...two, three.</i>

1021
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,835
Oh, yeah. Spin that bitch.

1022
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:44,670
- That good?
- How's that?

1023
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:48,675
<i>Guys, you have to see this. Come on</i>
<i>out here. Even you, Cameron. Over.</i>

1024
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,160
Screw you, Brandy.

1025
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:56,190
Shit, newbie, you are as smart
as you think you are.

1026
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:58,317
This is gonna be some serious payback.

1027
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,235
- What?
- Nothing.

1028
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:11,631
- We doing this?
- What?

1029
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,714
- Come on.
- Yeah.

1030
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,030
Yeah, let's do this.

1031
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,792
I'll just take my clothes off too.

1032
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:27,675
Take your time.

1033
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,275
Why don't you talk to her,
instead of being a Grumpy Gus?

1034
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,711
- I am not a Grumpy Gus.
- Yes, you are.

1035
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,712
- No, I'm not.
- You wanna hear a riddle?

1036
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,395
- Why did Eddie Vedder cross the road?
- Why?

1037
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,789
To get to the other side.

1038
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,873
Hey, hey, hey!
Jeremy spoke!

1039
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,879
- Who's that supposed to be?
- Who's that? That's Eddie Vedder.

1040
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,231
- That's not the face Vedder makes.
- Have you seen the "Jeremy" video?

1041
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,517
I've seen the "Jeremy" video,
that's not the face he makes.

1042
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,559
That is the face he makes. I get why
Brandy wants nothing to do with you.

1043
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:55,394
Fuck you, man. Bitch.

1044
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:59,154
One, two, three.

1045
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:13,151
- Oh, not again.
- What is this?

1046
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:17,754
- This thing is like a life preserver.
- Jerk. Give it back.

1047
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:21,550
You want it? Too bad.
I like you better without it.

1048
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,599
I cannot believe you just did that.

1049
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:35,034
Excuse me.
Better ask permission next time.

1050
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:36,750
Next time?

1051
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,157
Fuck you, Oak Crest.

1052
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,075
Busted.

1053
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:01,478
I'm gonna take a shit
in their fucking pool, man.

1054
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,392
What happened here?

1055
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,835
You're gonna look me in the eye
and deny all of this, huh?

1056
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:30,480
That doesn't prove anything.

1057
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,519
You wrote your name in this?
Who does that?

1058
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,672
I'm sorry. I'm going to college.

1059
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,309
You're supposed to write your name
on everything in case it gets lost.

1060
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:48,520
Look, your little prank
ruined our filtration system.

1061
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:51,434
- Not our problem.
- Well, it's gonna be your problem...

1062
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,672
...when I report you
to the Parks Department.

1063
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,475
Hey, friend? Hey, buddy,
don't do that, okay? Please.

1064
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:01,350
Look, the only way I won't call them...

1065
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,116
...is if you send
a handwritten apology note...

1066
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,556
...you promise
these pranks stop today...

1067
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:09,872
...and you fire old double-D here.

1068
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,671
- No one's getting fired.
- Brandy, you're fired.

1069
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,560
I'm gonna have to go to Office Max
for the other stuff.

1070
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:21,318
Are you kidding me, Willy? I'm your best
employee. I taught you how to swim.

1071
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,790
- What?
- I'm sorry, I can't lose my job.

1072
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,792
This is unbelievable.

1073
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:31,033
All summer everyone's been telling me
to loosen up and relax...

1074
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,760
...and not think so much and....

1075
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:35,713
Well, fuck that.

1076
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,233
And fuck you too.

1077
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:44,238
- Want a beer?
- No.

1078
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,600
Oh, come on,
don't look at me like that.

1079
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,116
Honey, can I speak with you?

1080
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:24,310
This whole thing has been so painful.

1081
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,752
Cameron was crying afterwards.

1082
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:31,310
They always do.

1083
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:35,110
You know, boys are just really
more sensitive than they let on.

1084
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:37,431
Your father included.

1085
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,356
Which reminds me,
don't say anything...

1086
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:44,514
...but I have planned a pretty sexy
surprise for us for our anniversary.

1087
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:46,717
Mom, I don't wanna hear
about you and Dad--

1088
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,270
Having intercourse? Noted.

1089
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:53,631
Honey, listen, as you move forward...

1090
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:58,400
...on your sexual journey,
just promise me one thing.

1091
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:02,596
- To have fun?
- To use lube.

1092
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:06,436
Doesn't always have to be painful.

1093
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:11,232
I wish my mother had given me lube
when I was your age.

1094
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:18,674
- Where exactly do I--?
- In the vagina, sweetie.

1095
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,679
Thanks, Mom.

1096
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:25,040
I got it.

1097
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:27,836
Boise Pool.

1098
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:30,510
- Rusty Waters, please.
<i>- Brandy?</i>

1099
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,274
Yes. Rusty, please.

1100
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,356
Rusty, it's Brandy.
She wants to talk to you.

1101
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:42,037
Hey, newbie. Heard you got fired.
That sucks.

1102
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:46,514
Yeah, I know. It'll be tough explaining
the employment gap in my résumé...

1103
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:51,352
...but anyway,
would you like to go out with me?

1104
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:58,035
Why not? I'll pick you up after work.

1105
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,078
- Cool.
<i>- Cool.</i>

1106
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:01,879
Very cool.

1107
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:04,834
What'd he say?

1108
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,231
- Yes.
- He did?

1109
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:13,110
Yes! He said yes.
Technically, he said "why not."

1110
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,839
But who cares about semantics.

1111
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,552
Because Rusty Waters said yes to me,
Brandy Klark, and we're gonna--

1112
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:21,791
Brandy, are you trying to do
the Roger Rabbit?

1113
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,560
- Yeah.
- That's not the Roger Rabbit.

1114
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,638
This is the Roger Rabbit.

1115
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:33,394
Maybe the Running Man
would be easier for you.

1116
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:34,630
Shit.

1117
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:40,236
- So you're taking Brandy out, huh?
- I guess so.

1118
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:43,040
Awesome. Good for her.
Still working on that sex manual.

1119
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:46,758
- Yeah-- What? Sex manual?
- Oh, you didn't know?

1120
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,240
Dude, check this out.

1121
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:52,438
She's writing some sort of sex
encyclopedia or something like that.

1122
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:55,832
It's like she can do whatever
and it's research. It's awesome.

1123
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,835
She wants to have, like, a good orgasm,
and, like, it's such a mature quest.

1124
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,269
- Did you know about this?
- No.

1125
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,750
You learn something new
at the pool every day.

1126
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:10,231
- I look--
- Good enough to fuck.

1127
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,717
I wasn't gonna put it that way, but....

1128
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,595
- Does it hurt the first time?
- Not if you chug a beer...

1129
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:22,274
...and use the lube Mom gave you.

1130
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:26,360
- She gave you the lube, right?
- Yes. That was weird.

1131
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:29,472
But helpful.

1132
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:34,556
Hey, are you okay? I noticed
you stopped eating your SnackWells.

1133
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:37,758
Chippy cheated on me. With strippers.

1134
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,877
- You gonna call off the wedding?
- I want to, but he won't call me back.

1135
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,390
Word of advice, don't fall in love.

1136
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:49,918
- Getting your heart broken fucking sucks.
- Yes, so I've heard.

1137
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:53,320
- Okay.
- Hey, have fun popping your cherry.

1138
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:55,879
I will.

1139
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,317
And I want you to know that...

1140
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,953
...I wouldn't be having sex tonight
if it weren't for you.

1141
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:04,316
- Really?
- Really.

1142
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,118
Thanks, Brandy, I really needed that.

1143
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:12,558
What's it gonna feel like?
I'll figure it out.

1144
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:14,154
Enjoy your penis.

1145
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,559
Here you go.

1146
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:51,716
You want another one?

1147
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,759
No, thank you. One is my limit.

1148
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,997
Hey, look, there's....

1149
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:03,229
There's something
I really wanna ask you.

1150
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,073
Shoot.

1151
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,631
Can I kiss you?

1152
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,995
I know you can kiss me,
but may you kiss me?

1153
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,551
- What?
- Forget it. You can definitely kiss me.

1154
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,080
Cool.

1155
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,678
Shit, I'm coming, all right?

1156
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:42,912
- Hey...? Hey, is Brandy here?
- No.

1157
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:47,433
I think she might be in some trouble
and I need to talk to her.

1158
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,273
Can I wait here? Is that cool?

1159
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,272
You got a dick under that poncho?

1160
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,269
Why?

1161
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,271
Maybe we should get a condom.

1162
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:12,678
Good idea.
Last thing we need's a baby, right?

1163
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:14,638
Or AIDS.

1164
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:27,320
- I need to tell you something.
- It's okay.

1165
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:30,154
I know you're a virgin.
I'll be gentle, okay?

1166
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:33,996
No, not that.
I mean, I am a virgin, but....

1167
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,278
I wanna be on top.

1168
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:40,475
It'll increase my chance of orgasm
by 40 percent.

1169
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:44,120
Those are some good odds.

1170
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:59,470
- You good?
- Yeah.

1171
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:23,431
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1172
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:28,714
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

1173
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:36,756
- Did you just--?
- Yeah. Didn't you?

1174
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:38,593
- Have an orgasm?
- Yeah.

1175
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,638
No. That was like less than a minute.

1176
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:42,870
Shit.

1177
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:58,558
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Look, I usually last like way longer.

1178
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:01,030
You just really got me,
like, riled up, okay?

1179
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,556
Just please take me home now.

1180
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:07,470
Look, if you just wait like two minutes,
like, he'll be ready to go again.

1181
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,234
I think I just saw Brandy.

1182
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,396
Oh, no. I'm certain that's not Brandy.

1183
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:17,071
Brandy's with Cameron
and he drives a Ford Festiva.

1184
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:20,438
- Why are you certain she's with Cameron?
- I gave her the lube and--

1185
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:24,230
You gave her the lube?
You had your talk with her, didn't you?

1186
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,596
Of course I did.
If I waited for you to do it...

1187
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:29,753
...she would be 40
before she has her first orgasm.

1188
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,594
This is really decent of you.
It's cool of you to do this.

1189
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:36,197
- Stop talking to me.
- Okay. Sorry.

1190
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,710
You're just doing me a real solid,
that's all.

1191
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:43,834
I might look like a rock star, but I'm
really a pretty traditional type of guy.

1192
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,469
You know,
like a missionary type of guy.

1193
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:49,195
Like a good old-fashioned me on top,
you on bottom.

1194
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:52,432
Not like this crazy-- You're super
aggressive. I mean, come on.

1195
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:57,476
Look, I'm a pretty sensitive dude, all right?
I'm a meat-and-potatoes type of guy.

1196
01:26:57,640 --> 01:26:59,199
You jerk!

1197
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:01,998
- Cameron?
- Jerk face.

1198
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,789
Cameron, calm down.
Please calm down.

1199
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:10,237
No, I will not calm down.
Did you make love with him?

1200
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:14,275
Yeah, dude. We did it.
Put the meat right in the taco.

1201
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:16,272
- Get off me.
- Oh, yeah.

1202
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:17,999
I can't believe I was so stupid.

1203
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:25,880
I get it. It's not having sex
that's a big deal, it's this.

1204
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:29,078
All these feelings and emotional crap.

1205
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:32,153
That's why it's better
if you leave feelings and shit out of it.

1206
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:33,834
Feelings are everything, Brandy.

1207
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:39,317
Why don't you wait
until you've done it once, virgin?

1208
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,671
Then you'll see that sex
isn't such a big deal.

1209
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,639
- How do you know I haven't had sex?
- Look at you.

1210
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,315
- Look at you!
- Hey, stop it. Stop it.

1211
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:49,358
You're animals. And you are wrong.

1212
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,512
- Yeah, you're wrong.
- Feelings matter.

1213
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:55,071
And having sex
with the right person is a big deal.

1214
01:27:56,040 --> 01:28:00,671
Cameron, come here.
Look, I owe you an apology.

1215
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:04,716
People talk about sex all the time
like it's no big deal...

1216
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:10,549
...but when you haven't done it,
when you're a virgin, it is a big deal.

1217
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:15,950
And I think the list was me
trying not to mess up.

1218
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,796
But I did mess up.

1219
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:24,432
I messed up when I hurt you.
And I'm really sorry.

1220
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:29,349
Well, I still can't believe
you chose Rusty over me.

1221
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,876
- Dude, I'm standing right here.
- Shut up, Rusty.

1222
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,635
You wanna go, Growing Pains?
You retarded Zack Morris.

1223
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,793
- Rusty, shut up.
- Both of you shut up. Both of you shut up.

1224
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,559
Cameron...

1225
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:44,951
...you are super nice and cute...

1226
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:48,238
...and kind and reliable.

1227
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,757
You're the kind of guy a girl
would love to be in a relationship with.

1228
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,389
- Will I regret messing that up?
- Probably yes.

1229
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:58,759
No. No. I'm a teenager.

1230
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:01,355
Teenagers don't have regrets.

1231
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:02,994
That's for your 30s.

1232
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:07,916
And, Rusty, Rusty, Rusty.

1233
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,198
You are superhot and ripped...

1234
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:18,351
...and you play the guitar
and I can't believe I had sex with you.

1235
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,591
Am I gonna regret
losing my virginity to you?

1236
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,479
Probably. Most girls do.

1237
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:25,950
No. Definitely not.

1238
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:30,273
You are gonna be an awesome story
to tell my friends.

1239
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,115
All right.

1240
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,997
Speaking of which...

1241
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:39,720
...that is where I should be right now.

1242
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:42,793
With my friends. Not here.

1243
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,869
Carry on, men.

1244
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,713
You're animals.

1245
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:02,916
Oh, ship.

1246
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,276
Put a vibrator in her stocking,
for God's sakes?

1247
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,636
No, I was saving it for her birthday.

1248
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:16,479
- I'm coming, honey.
- Wait.

1249
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:21,152
Just because you have lube,
doesn't mean you have to use it.

1250
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:25,997
Wait. George. Wait.

1251
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:29,120
I'm really-- I'm there.

1252
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,117
- Amber.
- Dad!

1253
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:38,111
Dad? Hey. Hey, Mr. Klark.
Hey, I'm Willy.

1254
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,000
- Judge.
- Judge, that's right.

1255
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,271
- Judge Klark.
- You're a fucking judge.

1256
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:47,196
Hey, look, I'm Brandy's boss
at the pool and....

1257
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:49,955
She's a great girl, by the way.
And so is this one.

1258
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:53,431
You've raised two amazing,
amazing daughters.

1259
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,876
I want you off my house
and out of my daughter!

1260
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:59,033
- Dad, gross.
- You know what I mean.

1261
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:07,716
- Anything else I can do for you, sir?
- Right now!

1262
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:10,520
- I just did it.
- Amber.

1263
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,718
- Mom.
- That's not Chip.

1264
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:15,998
No shit, Mom.
Get the fuck out of my room!

1265
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:20,040
No, leave it. Just leave it.
Finish up, please.

1266
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:22,835
<i>I'm the one who won't live to see</i>
<i>my daughter grow into a woman...</i>

1267
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,992
<i>...who won't be able to protect her</i>
<i>from the world.</i>

1268
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:29,916
<i>And I hate it. I hate that she'd rather</i>
<i>be with you, who has energy, who is fun.</i>

1269
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:31,839
<i>You told me to play with her.</i>

1270
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,835
<i>I know I did, but I didn't know</i>
<i>it was gonna make me feel like this.</i>

1271
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:40,993
Okay, you know what?
You can't handle this. I'm turning it off.

1272
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:45,234
- No, I can handle it.
- No, you can't. Look at you, you're a mess.

1273
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,432
What the hell are you doing?

1274
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,593
I don't want her here.

1275
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:58,558
She said she doesn't want you.
Get out.

1276
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:09,280
Okay, Jesus, stop.
What's wrong with you?

1277
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:12,558
You think you can start singing
and we're gonna forgive you?

1278
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,871
It doesn't work like that, okay?

1279
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:21,910
Wendy.

1280
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:52,437
- Fiona.
- I don't know the words.

1281
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:55,320
- Yes, you do.
- Yes, you do.

1282
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:35,240
That was super gay. Oh, my God.

1283
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:38,791
Don't tell anyone we did this.
I'm serious.

1284
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:42,795
- I'm really sorry, you guys.
- We know. We know.

1285
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:46,670
Also, I fucked Rusty Waters.

1286
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:48,672
- Look at you.
- How was it?

1287
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:50,194
Yeah.

1288
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:51,794
It was quick.

1289
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:56,712
Brandy, please tell me
you were not getting pregnant tonight.

1290
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:00,317
- Don't worry, she was here.
- Don't worry, she used a condom.

1291
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:02,996
Can we please
talk in the hallway, Dad?

1292
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,198
It's okay.

1293
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:07,874
- Just lie.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

1294
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:09,599
You're gonna be okay.

1295
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:13,200
Let me just start by saying...

1296
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:18,355
...if you ever need to talk about
birth control or rubbers or--

1297
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:20,876
Did you at least use the lube
that your mother--?

1298
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:24,750
Dad, I don't wanna talk
about that stuff with you.

1299
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:27,754
Thank goodness.
Because neither do I. Ever.

1300
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:32,316
I just....
I need to know that you're okay.

1301
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:34,352
Dad, I'm fine.

1302
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:36,993
Seriously.

1303
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:41,799
- You don't have to worry about me.
- I'm afraid that's not gonna be possible.

1304
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:45,239
Because you're my daughter
and I love you.

1305
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:55,396
Now, please go back to playing
with your loose friends.

1306
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:57,596
Okay, Dad.

1307
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:27,439
Never thought I'd see you
on the guard stand.

1308
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:37,838
- Well, hello.
- H i.

1309
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:40,475
You can't stay away from here.

1310
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:45,920
I heard that you stopped by my house
to save me, so to speak.

1311
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:47,992
I just wanted to come by
and thank you.

1312
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:52,439
Yeah, I tried to do the right thing, but
I ended up fucking your sister instead.

1313
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:56,678
She's hot. Your dad walked in.

1314
01:35:56,840 --> 01:36:01,119
- And my boner did not go away.
- I didn't need to hear that, Willy.

1315
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,516
I guess I'll be seeing you a lot now
that you're hanging out with my sister.

1316
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:10,520
No, we're not going out or anything.

1317
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:14,515
It's not like I didn't try,
but she said something like:

1318
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:19,357
"Fish needs a man
like a woman needs a tricycle"?

1319
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:22,035
I don't know.
Something you taught her.

1320
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:26,911
Hey, speaking of teaching,
I never paid you for the swim lessons.

1321
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:31,157
- You didn't think I'd give it to you, huh?
- No, actually.

1322
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:34,711
I'm a changed man, Brandy.

1323
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:40,952
And, if you want, if you have nothing
going on next summer...

1324
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:43,271
...you wanna come back here to work...

1325
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:45,631
...there's a manager position
waiting for you.

1326
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:49,840
- Wait, what? You're quitting?
- Yes.

1327
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,310
You just learned how to swim.
You worked so hard.

1328
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,995
Yeah, I know, but I think....

1329
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:59,475
I think getting with Amber made me
realize that I could do better, you know?

1330
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:02,951
Your sister's like caviar.
You're like cheese.

1331
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:05,237
- Okay. Okay, Willy.
- Like sharp cheddar.

1332
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:09,553
I tasted a little caviar and I realized, like,
what the fuck am I doing in Boise?

1333
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:14,070
So I'm gonna get out.
I'm gonna see the world...

1334
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,394
...and I'm gonna better myself.

1335
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:20,833
Well, I respect that. I actually think
that's very mature of you.

1336
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,754
Yeah. I'm gonna follow The Dead.

1337
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:27,069
You know, Jerry's health
isn't doing too well...

1338
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:29,277
...and I'm not getting any younger, so....

1339
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:34,590
Totally making the right decision.

1340
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:50,632
Ladies.
Oh, Marce, you're still homesick?

1341
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:55,000
Give it another month, Marcy.

1342
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:05,193
Hi there. Cameron.

1343
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:10,553
- It's been a while.
- I know.

1344
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:14,953
- You never returned my electronic mail.
- Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

1345
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:17,476
I just....
I think I needed some time.

1346
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:23,034
I understand. And I'm sorry too.
That night was really crazy.

1347
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:28,159
But I'm glad
that we, like, never had sex.

1348
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,312
I think it would've confused
our friendship.

1349
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:31,800
I know what you mean.

1350
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:34,318
- You do?
- Yes.

1351
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:39,680
- Really?
- I did it. I had sex.

1352
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:44,318
My roommate and I went out,
a drunk senior came up to me and said:

1353
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:46,159
"You a freshman?"
I was like, "Yeah."

1354
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:49,199
Next thing you know,
I'm losing it on the bathroom floor.

1355
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:52,320
- She just up and took it.
- She just up and took it.

1356
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:55,520
Yeah, but all that to say,
I just want you to know...

1357
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:57,911
...that I know what you meant that night.

1358
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:00,834
That sex is a big deal,
but it's also not a big deal.

1359
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,676
Don't get me wrong, it's a big deal,
but it doesn't have to be such a big deal.

1360
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:06,354
No, it doesn't.

1361
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:09,479
I guess what I mean is,
sometimes sex is just sex.

1362
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:12,639
Yeah, sometimes sex is just sex.

1363
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:23,717
Little circles. Little circles.

1364
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:26,630
Wait, I have an idea.

1365
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:34,156
Oh, my God. Yes.
Cameron, it's happening.

1366
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:36,556
Cameron, it's gonna happen.

1367
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:51,392
- Hey, they're doing a clambake with--
- Dad?

1368
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:54,473
I said, not the back door.

1369
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:58,156
There's doors we don't do.
The back door's one of them.

1370
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,358
We went over this.

1371
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:06,916
Good job, Cameron.

1372
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:15,916
