"But I cannot give
my heart to all of you."

47
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,710
"But they all want to dwell in it."

48
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,910
"Not everyone can
handle its attitude."

00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,190

..is for a young
woman entrepreneur..

73
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,750
..who has a carved a niche
for herself in record time.

74
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,390
She completely redefines
the term 'Woman Power'.

75
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,630
So without wasting any more time.

76
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,830
Let's give a huge round

77
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,490
..and it's dynamic, ravishing
and beautiful Managing Director.

78
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,510
Sunaina Janki Verma.

00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,160
Yeah, Sunaina.

80
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,430
Bravo.

81
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,070
You deserve it.

82
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,510
Cheers.

83
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,110
It's my utmost privilege and honor..

84
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,910
..to invite on stage, the
Managing Director of Janki Exports.

85
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,510
Sunaina Janki Verma.

86
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:46,830
All yours.

87
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,150
A big hand.

88
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,390
What is all this?

89
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,830
What is happening in this party?

90
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,030
Thank you, and I am honored
seeing you all here tonight.

91
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,190
And friends,
it's the time to celebrate.

92
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,030
This is the moment of
your success and my victory.

93
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,670
And it's definitely
the biggest party for me.

94
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,150
And I know it is for you.

95
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:15,430
Janki Exports' achievement
..as well as mine..

96
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,110
..is my biggest success.

97
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,910
When life closes one door.

98
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,870
And you feel tired..defeated..

99
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:35,870
It's just your courage and
strength that opens many doors.

100
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,120
And that's what makes
you discover the real you.

101
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,410
The fighter in you.

102
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,830
You must have heard..

103
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,950
..behind every successful man,
there's a woman.

104
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,150
But I would like to say..

105
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:57,580
..behind every successful woman,
is a successful man.

106
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,910
So please let me call
the honorable Vice-President..

107
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,470
..of the International
Gems and Jewelry Association.

108
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,350
Mr. Daniele Peterson, without whom..

109
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,870
..nothing would've
been possible for me.

110
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,970
Daniele.

111
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,320
Thank you, Sunaina.

112
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,350
Thank you very much everybody.
Thank you.

113
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,710
I don't deserve all these praises.

114
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,230
I appreciate the honor
being restored upon me.

115
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:31,190
But the truth is it's Sunaina
who deserves all the credit tonight.

116
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,590
I just saw her..and there
was a raw priceless diamond.

117
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,270
And look where she is today.

118
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,430
So please everybody,
let's call it for Sunaina..

119
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,470
..and party with her tonight.
This is her night.

Thank you.

133
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,630

You're the pride of India.

135
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,030
Congratulations.

136
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,670
Let's go.

137
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,670
Excuse me.

138
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,950
Mr. KK, you're leaving already.

139
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,590
Oh, hello Mr. Daniele.

140
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,670
Won't you stay and
say hello to Sunaina..

141
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,910
..the star of the evening.

142
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:52,670
Sunaina, won't you say hello to Mr.
KK Malhotra of KK Exports?

143
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,710
Mr. KK Malhotra,
what a lovely surprise.

144
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,750
Daniele, who doesn't know him.

145
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,110
Everything I am today..it's
all because of him.

146
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,390
What happened?

147
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,710
I think you're not
too happy with my success.

148
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:15,940
Right?

149
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,070
Monish. Why are you sweating?

150
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,510
Relax, calm down.

151
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,470
Why don't you get yourself a drink?

152
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,350
No, thank you.
We've to be somewhere else.

153
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,510
Come, dad.

154
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,350
Okay, see you.

155
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,070
One second, dad.

156
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,670
Quite a leap, Ms. Verma.

157
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,510
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

158
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,790
You know Sunaina,
this is a game of snakes-n-ladders.

159
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,470
You found an easy ladder..and
got to the top really quick.

160
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,630
- But you never know..
- Raj.

161
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,190
I am not scared of
any snakes..or ladders.

162
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,110
I am way above your
snakes-n-ladders game.

163
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,430
Nothing bothers me now.

164
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,590
You have changed.

165
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,310
Yes, I have.

166
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:12,150
And I had to..that's
why today I am where I am.

167
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,230
And you..

168
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:17,950
Raj..

169
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,230
Excuse me, Mr.
Daniele. I've to attend another party.

170
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,270
We'll meet some other time. Okay?

171
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,430
Come, Raj.

172
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,680
How dare she look
into my eyes and talk?

173
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,030
Who does she think she is?

174
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,470
She was looking in
my eyes and talking to me.

175
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,110
Has she grown so big?

176
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,830
And dad..did you notice
that foreigner Daniele?

177
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,750
How he was following her around?

178
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,470
I admit that he got us some
big contracts in the beginning.

179
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,870
There are many rumors in the market.

180
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,230
Sunaina..has snatched our
business in Europe, Australia..

181
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,790
..where we had the highest sales.

182
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,360
This was bound to happen.

183
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,470
This would've never happened if
you two had concentrated on business.

184
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,750
You two are useless.

185
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,870
Get lost.

186
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,870
But dad, what's my fault?

187
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,570
I said get out.

188
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,310
Please dad, stop worrying.

189
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,950
Everything will be fine.

190
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,510
This is a result of your naivety,
and I have to pay for it.

191
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,190
That Sunaina..has shaken the
very foundation of our business.

192
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,110
She has ruined everything.

193
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,310
- I am still here, dad.
- Shut up.

194
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,990
And get out!

195
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,790
I said leave me alone.

196
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,910
First time dad's
insulted me like this.

197
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,910
I just realized I am
only a live-in son-in-law.

198
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,910
And I always thought I am his son.

199
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,710
Monish, no need to lose your temper.

200
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:27,030
You know the condition of our family.

201
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,470
Try to understand Kishen's problems.

202
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,630
Who will understand my problems?

203
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,950
I never treated this
business as just another job.

204
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,630
I worked hard day and
night for this business.

205
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,150
See..here he comes.

206
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,830
- Raj.
- Monish.

207
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,950
What did I do wrong by supporting you?

208
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,070
Leave me.

209
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,430
And now I'm being
blamed for everything.

210
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,430
But the fact is that
it's all your doing.

211
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,430
Mom, stop him..please stop him.

212
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,110
And now I am getting
sandwiched from both ends.

213
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:51,910
Leave him.

214
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,470
- You're a bloody loser, Raj.
- Leave him.

215
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,270
I said leave him.

216
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,270
- You're a loser, Raj.
- Leave him.

217
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,790
How dare you call him a loser?

218
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,990
- He is a loser.
- Don't cross your limits?

219
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,310
He's ruined everything.

220
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:03,990
Let's go.

221
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,870
- Raj.
- I am being abused.

222
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,110
Wait, son.

223
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,190
He keeps fooling around,
drinking with his friends.

224
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,400
Raj listen to me.

225
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,270
Monty, who is she?

226
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,340
Never seen her before in the club.

227
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,950
- Hey Natasha, happy birthday.
- Thanks.

228
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,070
Happy birthday to you.

229
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,670
Happy birthday to you.

230
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,350
Happy birthday Natasha.

231
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,950
Oh come on, Kajal.

232
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,910
I know you can calculate
and make a rough estimate for me.

233
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:01,990
I told you..I will be
at Natasha's birthday party.

234
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,430
Look, I need this report tonight.

235
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,470
Any problem?

236
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,830
No, thank you though.

237
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,340
Your first time here?

238
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,870
Yeah, it's my first time.

239
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,110
Let me guess, friend's birthday.

240
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,670
Yeah, it's my friend's birthday.

241
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,790
- Happy birthday.
- Okay, alright..

242
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,870
- So..
- It was nice meeting you.

243
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,310
You're hot.

244
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,550
Listen buddy,
I think you've had enough to drink.

245
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,750
Let's all have a good time.

246
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,790
- Got to go.
- Hey..

247
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,150
- Let's have some fun.
- Get off.

248
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,150
Get off!

249
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,470
Hey..

250
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,350
- Leave me.
- Raj.

251
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,190
- What do you think of yourself?
- What are you doing?

252
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,870
- I won't spare you.
- Everyone's watching.

253
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,230
Raj, what's wrong with you?

254
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,150
I never saw you so serious.

255
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,550
Forget it, Monty.

256
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,670
I need to find that girl, buddy.

257
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,470
She's humiliated me..like
I've never been humiliated before.

258
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,270
I must find her at any cost.

259
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,350
I need to find that girl.

260
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,550
- See this..
- Come see..

261
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,390
She slapped him only once.

262
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,990
- And your video's showing it four times.
- One..two..three..four..

263
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,590
Jojo my boy, this is my style..

264
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,270
..which is always larger than life.

265
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,310
Now this..

266
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,430
This will hit Raj badly.

267
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,310
Bloody fool thinks he's a rock star.

268
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,670
And always showing off.

269
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,830
Now watch the fun.

270
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,030
I've forwarded this video to Facebook,
Twitter, Whatsapp..

271
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,870
..disco groups,
stud groups..everywhere.

272
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:01,230
And even to that stupid Raj.

273
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,430
Soon the entire city will know..

274
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,270
..that Raj Malhotra
was slapped by a girl.

275
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,230
Ba****

276
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,070
How dare you make a video of me?

277
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,550
- You call yourself a friend.
- Bloody..

278
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,790
- How dare you hit me?
- Shut up.

279
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,030
You've shown your true colors.

280
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,830
You should be happy.

281
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,630
I made you a star overnight.

282
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,310
What do you think of yourself?

283
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,070
Stop this.

284
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,070
Monty, take him away.

285
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,670
Leave me.

286
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,230
His video's got 10,000 likes, Jojo.

287
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,750
I made you a star overnight,
thankless man.

288
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:35,510
Get lost.

289
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,910
Come on, Raj, you've had enough.

290
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,550
You looked everywhere for her.

291
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,630
What can we do if we can't find her?

292
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,670
You need to relax, dude.

293
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,310
That girl how dare she?

294
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,590
Why are you getting so worked up, Raj?

295
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,790
Just forget it.

296
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,150
Let her go to hell.

297
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,590
I won't spare her.

298
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,870
But how will we find her?

299
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,630
We don't even know her name.

300
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,470
Why are we ruining our night for her?

301
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,110
Squeeze me.

302
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,390
- Do you have a light?
- No, I don't.

303
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:22,030
- Then what do you have?
- I have nothing.

304
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,230
But I can see your light.

305
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,350
It's not for you.
You need to leave.

306
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,630
- Hey honey..
- Hot.

307
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,510
Dude, I am never coming
back to this club again.

308
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,150
We need to go right now.

309
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,870
Why are we ruining your night for her?

310
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,990
We need to go right now.

311
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,110
No..I think you should
light his light.

312
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:47,990
Seriously.

313
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,950
Dude..Monty, wait up.

314
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,470
Look at what's happened to them.

315
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,630
If you don't look
after them properly..

316
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,270
..it spoils the entire garden.

317
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,550
Fool.

318
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,070
Don't let me catch you
again being so careless.

319
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,750
Concentrate on your work.

320
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,470
- Give it to me.
- Stupid fool.

321
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,230
Hello, grandma.

322
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,570
Sunaina.

323
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,630
After so long.

324
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,750
You're looking so beautiful, come on.

325
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,910
Come, sit.

326
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,590
What brings you here today?

327
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,190
How are you?

328
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,990
I am good, thanks to your blessings.

329
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:29,430
Dear, my blessings and
best wishes are always with you.

330
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,790
So what is it?

331
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,350
Actually grandma, sir sent
me here with an important task.

332
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,990
Your sir is always praising you.

333
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,910
Sir called up from Europe.

334
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,430
I need Mr. Raj Malhotra's
signatures on these papers.

335
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,870
Raj isn't at home right now.

336
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,590
- You've never met him, dear.
- No.

337
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,830
No one knows when he comes or goes.

338
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,310
- Here's some tea.
- Have tea.

339
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,630
Thank you.

340
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,390
Bhola, go check whether
Raj's in his room or not.

341
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,030
Grandma,
when the entire world wakes up..

342
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,630
..that's when Raj sir falls asleep.

343
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,910
And disturbing his
peaceful slumber now..

344
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,630
..would mean getting kicked out.

345
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,350
He's already kicked me twice
before..and sprained my back.

346
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,110
I don't have the courage anymore.

347
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,070
- Go on, go do your work.
- Okay.

348
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,990
Sunaina, I suggest that
you give me the papers.

349
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,510
I will take his signatures.

350
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,450
Grandma..this is very
urgent and important.

351
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,390
As soon as these papers are signed..

352
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,780
..I'll come and collect them.

353
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,870
Give them to me.

354
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,310
I'll get it signed and send it over.

355
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,870
- See you then.
- Okay Dear, bless you.

356
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,470
Keep coming more often.

357
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,350
I really like it.

358
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,670
Fine, I'll come again.

359
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,350
Thank you.

360
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,430
Bye.

361
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,130
Bhola..don't disturb
me in the morning.

362
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,130
It's me, not Bhola.

363
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,210
Its afternoon already.

364
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,770
You're just too much.

365
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,530
Get up..

366
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,210
Get up, son.

367
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:18,570
Tell me.

368
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,850
Here you go, son.
Keep this envelope carefully.

369
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,850
It has important documents.

370
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:24,690
And yes..

371
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,690
You need to sign these
papers immediately.

372
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,330
And deliver them to the office.

373
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,730
Grandma, please. Don't bore me.

374
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:36,010
- I won't go.
- Shut up you fool.

375
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,210
Your dad has such high hopes with you.

376
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,570
So what?

377
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:45,330
Son, you should go to the office.

378
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,130
Concentrate on the business.

379
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,370
All of this belongs to you.

380
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:52,970
And what's this?

381
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,210
Always fooling around
with your friends every night.

382
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,170
Drinking every day.

383
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,650
It's either this girl..or that.

384
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,650
I know everything.

385
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,090
Kishen doesn't like this at all.

386
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,250
Grandma, I don't like him either.

387
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,490
Business..work..money..attitude.

388
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,170
That's all dad ever thinks about.

389
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,130
Did he ever ask me what I want?

390
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,090
Or what's in my heart.

391
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,450
If you have so many
complaints with him..

392
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,490
..then why don't you
say something to him.

393
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,490
When he's at home, you're not.

394
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,130
He's a dictator.
He will never understand me.

395
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:29,970
Okay, son. Do as you want.

396
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,450
But at least come
down and have breakfast.

397
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,510
I've made your favorite 'lasunia'.

398
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:43,050
Grandma..that's lasagna.

399
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,730
But for you I can even eat 'Lasunia'.

400
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:52,770
- Love you, grandma.
- Love you too, son.

401
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:00,410
- You should call.
- You think so..

402
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,330
Vishal.

403
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,050
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning, ma'am.

404
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,130
Monish sir was asking you.

405
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,450
- Okay, any phone calls?
- Yeah.

406
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:11,690
There was a call from
Diamond Trading Corporation.

407
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,690
Their representative
is coming on Monday.

408
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:16,450
Okay, you have the schedule.
But book it for the morning.

409
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,450
Yes, ma'am.

410
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,570
- Oh..take my bag.
- Yes.

411
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:20,610
- Okay.
- See you.

412
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,490
Hey, Monish.

413
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,370
I heard you were looking for me.

414
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,490
What's up?

415
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:31,250
Yes.. I swear..if it wasn't for you..

416
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,650
..work would have been so boring.

417
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,010
Don't start that again.

418
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,130
What to do?

419
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,930
Whenever I look at you,
I feel something.

420
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,170
Monish, what do you want?

421
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,530
Okay, anyway..

422
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,010
Our big boss, the company's Godfather.

423
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,770
Mr. Daniele Peterson
is coming down from London.

424
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,530
Oh really, he's coming again.

425
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,970
This time he's going to
give us a huge international deal.

426
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,050
Okay?

427
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,290
KK sir has said that
you will go to meet him.

428
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,770
You have about two hours.

429
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:05,850
Here's the file.

430
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,010
- Okay, I got to go. Bye.
- Catch you.

431
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:08,930
All the best.

432
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,250
Oh man, she works in our office.

433
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:43,410
Raj..what brings you
to our office today?

434
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,050
There was a girl downstairs,
in the parking.

435
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,410
Do you know who she is?

436
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:48,890
Not here too.

437
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,930
Here, have a cigarette.

438
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:52,970
Right.

439
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,540
For your kind information,
Mr. Raj Malhotra.

440
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,720
This is the office
of Gems and Jewelry.

441
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,810
And beautiful girls often come here.

442
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,410
I am not talking about
those who visit the place.

443
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:12,290
I am talking about her.

444
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:13,850
Her.

445
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,180
Her?

446
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,570
She is Sunaina.

447
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:21,410
Our company's Business
Development Manager.

448
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,770
Why do you have her
photo in your mobile?

449
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,530
Sunaina..

450
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,350
KK Exports..

451
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,610
Business Development Manager.

452
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:39,090
For your kind information, Raj..

453
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:45,130
She's hot..sexy..but
she's very-very tough.

454
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,210
She's not an easy catch, bro.

455
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,250
You cannot win her over.

456
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,370
Don't you know me?

457
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,250
I know you too well.

458
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,530
You cannot win her over.

459
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,130
Are you trying to challenge me?

460
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,570
Want to make a bet?

461
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,200
Fine, it's a bet then.

462
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,010
You cannot win her over.

463
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,890
10 days..and she will be in my bed.

464
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,290
What? Are you crazy?

465
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,330
You will lose this bet.

466
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:22,630
If I lose..then my bank-balance,
my property, my shares..

467
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,570
..it will all be yours.

468
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,810
I will be your slave.

469
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,930
But remember..Raj Malhotra..

470
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:35,250
..never loses a bet.

471
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,530
But what if you lose?

472
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,050
What kind of childishness is this?

473
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:44,730
You know I don't have
anything to give you.

474
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,050
Even if you lose..

475
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,930
..give me one rupee.

476
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,090
10 days..

477
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:05,090
We'll see Raj Malhotra,
how you win this bet.

478
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:12,030
And in India this is
how the industry works.

479
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,330
Yeah, that's how it is.

480
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,210
Thank you.

481
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,530
I know, but I think
it will grow further.

482
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,940
Thank you.

483
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,730
Why are you looking at me like that?

484
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,770
You're an uncut unique diamond.

485
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:36,010
And it's priceless.
Only I know what that's worth.

486
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:37,610
Thanks.

487
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,250
Here's the contract.

488
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,450
Oh, let me take a look at this.

489
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,210
I trust you blindly.

490
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:51,250
All this would be nothing
if it wasn't for you.

491
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,330
This is all because of you, Sunaina.

492
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:56,330
You're not going to read that.

493
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:01,370
I would sign my life,
my will, my everything to you.

494
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:03,850
Really?

495
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,810
Thank you for everything.

496
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,410
I have something for you.

497
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:09,930
I want you to have this.

498
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,530
I..I can't accept that.

499
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,850
Please..please..

500
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,210
Daniele..

501
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,330
I hope you like it.

502
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,970
- I can't accept this, this is too much.
- Please, stop.

503
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,930
It's a small token of my appreciation.

504
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,570
Please, from me to you.

505
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,170
Well..I guess, thank you.

506
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,050
You know,
I've to get back to the office.

507
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,570
But I will see you tomorrow.

508
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,530
No, I am off tomorrow. Flying out.

509
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,410
Such a short trip.

510
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,890
I am here for you,
and I am here for this deal.

511
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,810
That's all.

512
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,690
- Let me walk you out.
- Okay.

513
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,010
- I am going to miss you.
- So you're going to miss me.

514
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,810
I always miss you.

515
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,930
Well. It was nice seeing you.

516
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:14,690
Good morning.

517
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,810
You? How did you get here?

518
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,550
Well, the door was open, so I came in.

519
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,050
Shut up.
How dare you?

520
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,610
How dare you?

521
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:23,490
Listen to me, Sunaina..

522
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,730
I don't want to hear anything.

523
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,370
- Get out you bloody stalker.
- What happened?

524
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,300
- Try to..
- What happened, Sunaina?

525
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,210
Mr. Dixit, this bloody loafer
followed me all the way here!

526
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,840
Throw him out immediately.

527
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,330
- But Sunaina, listen to me..
- I don't want to hear anything.

528
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,650
Call the security, call the police.

529
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:37,950
Throw this rascal out.

530
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,490
Okay, relax. I am leaving.
Okay. Chill.

531
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,130
What's this?

532
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,290
You're mistaken, dear.

533
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,570
- That's Raj. KK sir's son.
- What?

534
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,010
- KK sir's son.
- Yes.

535
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,610
Did you call the police? Let's go.

536
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:01,730
No..I'm really sorry.

537
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,770
I didn't know, and I got carried away.

538
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,730
No, it's okay. Please don't be sorry.

539
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:07,330
Chocolate.

540
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,530
Actually..I've been looking
for you to apologies.

541
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:14,410
And what a pleasant surprise,
that I found you in my office.

542
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,050
Please have a seat.

543
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,090
No, it's okay.

544
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,370
Okay, as you wish.

545
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,850
Let's talk.

546
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:25,850
You know, Sunaina..my life
completely changed after that day.

547
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,810
I am a completely changed man.

548
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:31,850
You see, a man who never
set foot in his office..

549
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:34,650
..gets dressed and arrives
in the office at 9.

550
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:37,450
Can you imagine..
It's all because of you.

551
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,970
Whatever happened was unintentional.

552
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,970
- I am sincerely sorry, I..
- Sunaina, please.

553
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,010
Let's just cut these apologies
and let's start all over again.

554
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,370
I am Raj Malhotra.

555
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,250
I am Sunaina.

556
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,930
Look, I've some important
work to take care of.

557
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,450
- Please excuse me.
- Sure.

558
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:07,570
Okay!

559
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:12,810
So the guy you slapped
turns out to your boss' son.

560
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:15,410
Wow! What a lovely coincidence.

561
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,530
It's a crazy coincidence.

562
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,930
What is your problem?

563
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,410
That night he was drunk, right.

564
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,170
And you slapped him.

565
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,610
Didn't you?

566
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,760
You just hit the jackpot.

567
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,930
He's so rich. He's so handsome.

568
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,560
Natasha, shut it.

569
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:40,690
I don't understand whether I can
keep working in that office or not.

570
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,890
Why? Is he firing you?

571
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,970
I don't know what's in his heart?

572
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,410
Forget him..I'll tell you one thing.

573
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,450
If I was in your place,
then definitely..

574
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,090
Natasha, please. I am under stress..

575
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,130
..and all you can think of is romance.

576
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,690
I am a romantic girl,
so I'm bound to think of romance.

577
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,890
But I don't understand this.

578
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,370
Aren't you bored of living alone?

579
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,530
I want to see you happy.

580
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:12,250
Why don't you call
mom to stay with you?

581
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:17,130
I would keep mom with me always.

582
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:20,290
But her dance institute
is in Pune, and..

583
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:24,570
..for some reason,
she doesn't like Mumbai.

584
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,530
Don't worry,
I am there with you always. Okay.

585
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:28,970
- Take good care of yourself.
- Okay.

586
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,730
And give my love to your mom.

587
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,110
- Okay.
- Okay.

588
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,650
- Bye.
- Bye.

589
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,010
It's from our new contemporary line.

590
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,410
I think you guys will love it.

591
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,810
- No-no..
- Same old..

592
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:46,210
- We don't like it.
- Not good.

593
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,290
I don't like this.

594
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,570
- Sunaina, all okay.
- Sir.

595
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,810
Please meet our guest from China.

596
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:53,770
Hi.

597
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:57,850
This is Ms.
Tchang Lee, Mr. Dong, Tsetsi..

598
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,650
..and Mr. Fung Lui from
Chai-Tow Fuk Gems and Jewel.

599
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,290
- 'Ni Hau' (Hello), everyone.
- Hello. Hello.

600
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,130
I am Raj Malhotra. Please have a seat.

601
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:09,130
You can speak Chinese, wow!

602
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:12,050
- Very good.
- Yes, little bit. Thank you.

603
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,730
- Sir, they are..
- Sunaina.

604
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:18,450
You know China is a beautiful place,
with beautiful people.

605
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,210
And the technology,
the brain that they have.

606
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,460
I think no wonder you guys
are ruling the entire world right now.

607
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:28,370
And I must say, last time
I went to Beijing and Shanghai..

608
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,810
..these are one of the most
beautiful places in the world.

609
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,010
Thank you, Mr. Raj.

610
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,650
When you visit China, be our guest.

611
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,290
Oh, thank you so much.

612
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,090
I'll surely keep that in mind.

613
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:40,170
So tell me one thing,
how can I help you?

614
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,170
I mean what sort of
designs are you looking for?

615
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,370
Some different designs.

616
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,610
Your company has a
great reputation in China.

617
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,330
- And we love India.
- Yes, India-China..brothers.

618
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,850
Brothers-Brothers..

619
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,330
But not brother-sister.

620
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,730
- So, Mr. Dixit.
- Yes.

621
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:03,530
Remember that stuff in my cabin..which
has been lying around for a while.

622
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,450
Get them.

623
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:06,710
But son, it's been lying
unused for over 10 years..

624
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:09,610
Mr. Dixit. Just do as I say. Go.

625
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:13,250
And now we're going to
show you the latest collection.

626
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:14,890
It's called the
'Dhool-Collection' (Dust).

627
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:20,650
Raj sir, what you're asking
for..has been rejected thrice.

628
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,050
Sunaina, even kids
can sell the good stuff.

629
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,970
Try selling the bad ones..

630
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,850
Now watch what happens.

631
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,770
Mr. Dixit, let me.

632
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,250
You don't like it much?

633
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:36,970
Tell him to calm down.

634
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:41,370
And now..presenting
the 'Dhool-Collection'.

635
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:44,970
- Dust! Dust!
- No-no-no, don't worry.

636
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:46,810
This is not dust.

637
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:50,010
This is the royal filtered
sand of Jaisalmer.

638
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:52,810
- You know Jaisalmer?
- Yes-yes.

639
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,610
The famous tourist place of India.

640
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:55,650
Exactly.

641
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,770
So this jewelry has
to be kept in the sand.

642
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,010
Look at this.

643
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,290
Very good design.

644
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,130
See this.

645
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,010
These are all unique pieces.

646
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,530
In fact, the one you're
holding..the blue one..

647
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,490
..it's also the Feng-Shui
color of prosperity.

648
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:13,520
It's nice.

649
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:18,190
And this young lady, is only for you.

650
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,410
Wow! Beautiful.

651
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:21,890
Thank you so much.

652
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:26,410
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

653
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,730
My order, 10,000 pieces.

654
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,250
Yes..my first order.

655
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,410
- Mr. Dixit.
- Yes.

656
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:35,330
- How many do we have?
- We do have enough.

657
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,970
Okay, so done.

658
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,210
Sunaina, complete the paperwork.

659
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,370
I think the deal is done.

660
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,250
- 'Saiche'.
- Thank you..'saiche' (Goodbye),

661
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:51,890
And Mr. Dixit. From my side, 1 kg
of pure filtered sand from Jaisalmer.

662
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:55,130
- India to China, a gift.
- Thank you..

663
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,370
Just remember..

664
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,890
India-China..brothers.

665
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,450
But not brother-sister.

666
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,410
Cheers.

667
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:09,570
No one thought you would impress
those Chinese the way you did.

668
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:14,690
On a more serious note,
you left everyone speechless.

669
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,050
I didn't leave them speechless.

670
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,890
In fact, I left Sunaina speechless.

671
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,010
If she's MBA in marketing..

672
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:26,410
..then even I am double MBA in love.

673
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,090
That you are.

674
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,690
But tell me..what is your game-plan?

675
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,930
What's the point in knowing the plan?

676
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,410
Leave the plan to me.

677
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:44,490
Just remember the date.

678
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:49,570
18th July..see you.

679
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,570
Will he win the bet?

680
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:57,010
And yes, I will win the bet.

681
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,490
Rascal, he can even read minds.

682
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,930
Ma'am, this is the entry
of Singapore's Michael Jewelers..

683
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,570
..which we had sent the delivery.

684
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:09,490
Ma'am, I've sent the
courier you asked me to.

685
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,130
No more parties for me. Yeah.

686
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:15,730
Well, I need to take
care of dad's business now.

687
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,810
Yeah.

688
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,370
I am a changed man now.

689
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,290
Will you guys let me work or not?

690
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,010
Let me work.

691
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,170
Bye.

692
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:38,130
"O beloved..you've colored
me..in color of love."

693
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:47,970
"I am treading down the
lane..I always kept away."

694
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:55,490
"O beloved..you're quite a charmer."

695
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:03,850
"O beloved..you've
filled me with love."

696
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:15,050
"You made a place for
yourself in my heart."

697
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:23,130
"My vagabond beloved.
My crazy lover."

698
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,490
"My vagabond beloved.
My brimming glass of love."

699
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:33,650
"My vagabond beloved.
My crazy lover."

700
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:38,970
"My vagabond beloved.
My brimming glass of love."

701
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:04,460
"O beloved.."

702
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,330
- Sir, excuse me.
- Sunaina.

703
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,250
- Sorry to disturb you.
- No-no..tell me.

704
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,890
Actually, it's Saturday..

705
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,450
..and normally that
means half-day in office.

706
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,290
So we were planning on leaving.

707
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,920
Oh shoot,
I was so busy that I didn't realize.

708
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,690
Look Sunaina, you guys carry on.

709
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,090
It's going to take me a while.

710
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,610
Because I am just working
on a strategy for the company.

711
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,810
Its-it's a new growth
plan that I am making.

712
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,450
So I am going to take some time.

713
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:34,810
But you guys carry on.

714
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,250
If it's urgent,
then we don't mind staying.

715
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,570
No-no-not at all.

716
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:41,850
Because knowing me,
I can be here all night.

717
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:42,890
All night.

718
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,810
Look, I've a problem.

719
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:49,770
If I take on a task, then
I can't rest until I don't finish it.

720
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,410
And call it a problem or my habit.

721
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,610
This is how I am.

722
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,850
Okay, I guess..have a good weekend.

723
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,170
You too.

724
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,170
Okay guys, we can all leave.

725
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:20,010
Yeah Monty, I am bored.

726
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:23,280
No.. order a drink for me.
I am coming.

727
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:28,370
I wonder how people
can work for 8-10 hours.

728
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:29,770
Well..I'll see you.

729
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:34,570
You know, I am finding
something very strange about Raj.

730
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,050
Strange?

731
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,010
I can understand.

732
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:39,890
It happens in the beginning.

733
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:42,050
Everything seems strange.

734
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,770
Shut up, Natasha.

735
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,610
What I mean is..

736
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,330
Raj is different.

737
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:52,090
He isn't just into party and clubbing.

738
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:55,530
In fact..he knows his work.

739
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:59,850
I mean..he's still
working in the office.

740
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,410
Can you believe it?

741
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,530
I am feeling really guilty.

742
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,810
We're partying here..

743
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,930
..and he's still there.

744
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,330
You're so serious.

745
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:21,410
If he's working in the office,
then let him.

746
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:22,890
You can't stay without him.

747
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,530
I think you have fallen for him.

748
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:29,890
Listen, I am not the
emotional love type, okay.

749
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,650
You're the best judge, you know.

750
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:38,010
But..I guess there's
something in his heart.

751
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,410
I mean he's different.

752
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,090
He's not the same guy
I met on the first day.

753
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:44,810
- You know what, you're hooked.
- What?

754
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:46,410
You're in love.

755
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,330
- You're in love, Sunaina.
- I am not in love.

756
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:49,210
You're in love.

757
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:51,730
- Yes, you're in love.
- I am not in love.

758
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:53,890
Natasha, come back here.

759
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,430
Good morning.

760
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,510
Happy birthday, dear.

761
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,310
Thank you so much, mom.

762
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,750
So, how are you?

763
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:12,990
I am absolutely fine.

764
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,670
How are you?

765
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,990
How is work?

766
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,710
I hope you take breakfast on time.

767
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:20,510
- And I hope you don't skip lunch.
- Mom.

768
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:24,830
If you're worry so much,
why don't you come live with me?

769
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,910
I want to.

770
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:30,470
Once these kids dance
competition is over..

771
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:33,310
..I'll come over immediately.

772
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,830
Mom, do one thing.

773
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:40,670
Buy a big cake on my behalf,
and eat it.

774
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,750
And also give it to the kids.

775
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,910
I am fasting today.

776
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:49,510
Fasting. What for?

777
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:53,510
Since when did you start fasting?

778
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,070
Well, it's your birthday today..

779
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:58,230
..so I thought of fasting, and I did.

780
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,270
Mom, you're the best.

781
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:03,110
You know I miss you so much,
and I love you.

782
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:06,030
I miss you too, dear. And I love you.

783
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,350
Who sent these flowers?

784
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,030
Ma'am, someone delivered
this in the morning..

785
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:15,350
..and said it's for you.

786
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:16,910
- For me?
- Yes, madam.

787
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,430
- Make me a cup of tea, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

788
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:28,230
Sunaina, today is the
most beautiful day of my life.

789
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:29,630
Happy Birthday.

790
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,990
- Hello.
- Hope you like carnations.

791
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,150
They are from you.

792
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:43,830
Happy birthday Sunaina.

793
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:47,430
Thank you, sir.

794
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:49,790
Sunaina, don't be formal.

795
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,390
I am your boss only in the office.

796
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,390
You can call me Raj.

797
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:55,550
What say?

798
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:59,990
- Dinner..you and me.
- Dinner?

799
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:01,590
Yes, dinner.

800
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:06,910
Are you asking me out on
a dinner date, Mr. Raj Malhotra?

801
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,390
Maybe.

802
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,670
But I am fasting today?

803
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,990
Fast.. What?

804
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,590
You mean..you're fasting.

805
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,030
Fasting on your birthday.

806
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:22,270
Yes..so?

807
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,590
Fine.
We can eat other things.

808
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:29,870
Like fruits, juices..sago and all.

809
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,910
But I don't even drink water.

810
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:36,950
- Oh..okay.
- I am so sorry.

811
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:39,870
Maybe some other time, Raj.

812
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:41,510
But thank you for the flowers.

813
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,150
I will break your fast, Sunaina.

814
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:17,550
"Excuse me..wanna love you-love you."

815
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,990
"Excuse me..wanna
touch you-touch you."

816
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:26,550
"Excuse me..wanna love you-love you."

817
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:28,710
"Let me take you in my arms."

818
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:30,990
"Fix you in my heart."

819
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:33,430
"Stay away..don't touch me."

820
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:35,070
"You don't know.."

821
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,350
"The entire.."

822
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:39,590
"The entire country's after me."

823
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:44,070
"The entire country's after me."

824
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:48,590
"The entire country's after me."

825
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:53,030
"The entire country's after me."

826
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:14,190
"My lips want to touch yours."

827
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:19,150
"I want to love you..and
sway in your arms."

828
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:22,390
"My lips want to touch yours."

829
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:24,670
"I want to love you..and
sway in your arms."

830
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,990
"Since it met you, it's restless."

831
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:29,350
"My desires are out of control."

832
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:33,750
"Stay away..don't touch me."

833
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,510
"You don't know.."

834
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:37,710
"The entire.."

835
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:39,990
"The entire country's after me."

836
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:44,470
"The entire country's after me."

837
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:48,990
"The entire country's after me."

838
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:53,470
"The entire country's after me."

839
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:06,350
"Your capricious body
makes my heart restless."

840
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:10,310
"There's no peace without you."

841
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:13,910
"Your capricious body
makes my heart restless."

842
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:16,150
"There's no peace without you."

843
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:18,350
"You're my love..you're my choice."

844
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:20,910
"My heart is all yours."

845
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:25,110
"Stay away..don't touch me."

846
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:26,990
"You don't know.."

847
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:29,150
"The entire.."

848
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:31,390
"The entire country's after me."

849
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:35,950
"The entire country's after me."

850
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:40,350
"The entire country's after me."

851
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:42,870
"Excuse me..wanna love you-love you."

852
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:47,430
"Excuse me..wanna
touch you-touch you."

853
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:51,950
"Excuse me..wanna love you-love you."

854
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:54,150
"Let me take you in my arms."

855
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,830
"Fix you in my heart."

856
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:14,430
"Stay away..don't give me s*** now."

857
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:16,230
"You don't know.."

858
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,510
"The entire.."

859
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:20,670
"The entire world's after you."

860
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:25,150
"The entire world's after you."

861
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:28,430
"Excuse me..wanna love you-love you."

862
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:33,680
"Excuse me..wanna
touch you-touch you."

863
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:35,390
"Excuse me.."

864
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,230
- I am not going to blink now.
- No.

865
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:40,750
- You're going to blink.
- You're going to blink.

866
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:42,830
- You're going to blink now.
- You're going to blink first.

867
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:45,990
Hey Raj.

868
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:47,990
You lost.

869
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:49,710
Where have you been?

870
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:50,790
You hardly come to the pubs either.

871
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:51,750
Just been busy.

872
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:53,470
- First meet Sunaina.Sunaina, Harry.
- Hi.

873
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:54,270
Hi.

874
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:57,950
Raj, that's the same girl
who slapped you in the pub.

875
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:59,430
- This is nice..
- Dude, just come here.

876
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:01,110
- Harry..
- Where are you taking me?

877
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:02,590
She is my serious girlfriend.

878
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:04,430
Fine, so she is your
serious girlfriend.

879
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:06,030
But together we've gone
around with many girls.

880
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,230
What's the big deal?

881
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:09,270
Plus you know she's smoking hot.

882
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:10,990
Harry, don't talk nonsense. Please.

883
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:12,230
Let me take her tonight.

884
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:14,950
Come on..come on..
come on..hook me up.

885
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:16,150
I said don't talk nonsense.

886
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:23,070
Raj, you bloody ba****

887
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:25,630
Raj.

888
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:27,630
Raj.

889
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:29,590
Next time behave yourself.

890
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:30,990
- Okay.
- Let's go.

891
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:36,470
Raj, mind you..you
have changed a lot.

892
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:39,750
Look what you've done.

893
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:50,990
Such a temper..such madness.

894
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:53,150
Didn't you hear what he was saying?

895
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:58,030
My goodness, you're so angry.

896
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:00,230
I didn't know this about you.

897
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:40,070
I think it's too late.

898
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:44,030
"O beloved.."

899
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:45,990
- Yes.
- I'll leave now.

900
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:49,630
"You're such a charmer."

901
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:53,110
"O beloved.."

902
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:58,190
"You've filled me with love."

903
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:16,110
I brought KK Exports to this
level..with years of hard work.

904
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:21,030
And now I am watching
it gradually crumble.

905
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:23,150
Why are our quotations failing?

906
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:25,230
Why is this happening with us, sir?

907
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:26,950
That's not the case, Dixit.

908
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:30,830
Everyone knows about us in the market.

909
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:33,390
And when a company's
reputation falls..

910
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:35,950
..then even the lowest
quotations seem high.

911
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:38,550
No one trusts us anymore.

912
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:41,350
Everything is almost over.

913
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:43,670
Nothing's left anymore.

914
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:45,230
Nothing at all.

915
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,150
- Hello.
- Congratulations.

916
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:05,350
I called to inform you, that..

917
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:11,390
..KK Exports has sent a quotation
to the clients from Canada.

918
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:16,110
I am..mailing those
quotations to you.

919
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:18,190
Thank you, Monish.

920
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:20,110
You're always welcome, Sunaina.

921
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:21,870
I am sorry, Sunaina madam.

922
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:26,630
This time my share..will
be a little extra.

923
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:30,710
Don't worry,
you'll get your commission.

924
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:44,110
Mr. Malhotra, your given quotation
is a bit on the higher side.

925
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:47,710
No problem,
we can always make some changes.

926
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:55,830
I am extremely sorry,
but we finalized another company.

927
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:57,270
What?

928
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:58,750
But-but, sir.

929
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:03,670
May I know the name
of company you've finalized?

930
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:05,350
I will tell you.

931
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:06,790
Janki Exports!

932
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:19,430
Gentlemen.

933
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,270
I knew it.

934
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:23,510
I just knew it.

935
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:26,430
What are your intentions?

936
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:27,830
What do you want?

937
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:31,110
Business.

938
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:34,830
Good and fair..business..

939
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:37,190
..which I learnt from you.

940
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:43,030
Mr. Malhotra, your coffee is coming.

941
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:45,070
Thank you, I'll like to leave.

942
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,550
- Well, I have your contract.
- Yes.

943
00:53:57,550 --> 00:53:58,590
Sign here.

944
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:00,270
Pen, please.

945
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:20,150
Why am I counting?

946
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:23,750
I am sure it's all here.

947
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:26,230
I trust you.

948
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,510
By the way,
there is one thing Sunaina.

949
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:31,350
I am sorry.

950
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:33,870
Sunaina ma'am.

951
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,910
I must address you as ma'am now.

952
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:40,510
You have really ruined
my father-in-law..

953
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:44,390
..I mean KK Exports, for good.

954
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,910
The bank yesterday sealed
our office in New Mumbai.

955
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:55,590
And..our storehouse
was sealed long ago.

956
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:00,350
I don't see Daniele.

957
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:02,390
That's none of your business.

958
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:08,470
Monish, I think you
have everything you need.

959
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:10,110
Shall we?

960
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:13,230
Okay. Okay.

961
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:17,150
There was another thing.

962
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:20,510
KK sir got what he deserved.

963
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:24,190
But I can't see Raj's condition.

964
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:29,150
Earlier..he was a Casanova.

965
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:33,630
And now, he's always
drunk..like typical 'Devdas'..

966
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:37,670
..and keeps wandering on the streets.

967
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:08,110
What's going on, KK?

968
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:10,150
What's wrong with you?

969
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:13,430
You've been taking
lot of stress these days.

970
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:15,230
Nothing.

971
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:16,510
Usual business.

972
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:20,070
There's nothing to worry about now.

973
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:21,710
No work-no business.

974
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:34,910
Doctor, what's wrong with dad?

975
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:36,710
Very high BP.

976
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:41,430
If you don't take care of him,
then it can lead to a serious problem.

977
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:45,350
So you my boy,
better take good care of your dad.

978
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:47,670
And let him rest, okay?
Take care.

979
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:52,710
Raj, this is all because of that bet.

980
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:54,710
I won't spare that Sunaina.

981
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:56,350
You wait and watch.

982
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:06,820
- Stop.
- Sunaina! Sunaina!

983
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:08,700
Get lost. Leave me.

984
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:10,140
What's wrong, Raj?

985
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,220
You look furious today.

986
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:18,250
Did you forget who you are?

987
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:21,530
You've become that Daniele
Peterson's mistress just to ruin us.

988
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:26,450
You..

989
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:28,850
You can say that.

990
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:30,370
Go on, Raj.

991
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:36,850
I won't feel offended
by anything you say.

992
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:39,250
Please, continue.

993
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:41,250
Last warning, Sunaina.

994
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:44,290
Do not cross your limits.

995
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:47,050
My dad's in grave state
of shock because of you.

996
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:49,370
What? Because of me?

997
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:51,210
What happened?

998
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,570
What happened to KK sir?

999
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:57,250
Oh really..are you that concerned?

1000
00:57:57,370 --> 00:58:00,210
Yes, I am concerned for him.

1001
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,610
I have always cared for you,
and your family.

1002
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:06,690
In spite of everything
that's happened between us.

1003
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:10,090
I know nothing will happen to him.

1004
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,970
He will be just fine.

1005
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:13,650
Such sympathy.

1006
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:18,050
I know you hate us all.

1007
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:20,650
That's not true.

1008
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:23,010
Please, try and understand.

1009
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:26,570
I have everything today..

1010
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:31,330
..but yet, I have nothing.

1011
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:33,450
No.

1012
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:35,330
Why did it happen?

1013
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:39,450
And was it entirely my fault?

1014
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:40,770
I've missed you.

1015
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:43,770
I've missed you every moment.

1016
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:46,170
I want things to go
back to the way they were.

1017
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:47,850
They can't, Sunaina.

1018
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:49,970
I love you.

1019
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:54,770
And I know..you cannot forget me.

1020
00:58:56,810 --> 00:59:01,010
- No, it's too late now.
- No-no..it's not too late.

1021
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:07,290
- We can start a new life together.
- No Sunaina, no.

1022
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:08,930
- Please don't leave me.
- Leave me.

1023
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:12,730
Please don't go.

1024
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:16,050
I love you.

1025
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:21,370
Don't leave me.

1026
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:27,050
Mr. Dixit.

1027
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:31,690
Yes, dear. What is it?

1028
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:34,250
Where has Mr. Raj disappeared to?

1029
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:36,050
He hasn't been coming
to the office either.

1030
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:37,850
And his phone's switched off too.

1031
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:39,810
It's hard to predict these rich brats.

1032
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:42,250
He started coming
to the office on his own..

1033
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:44,410
..and now he's stopped coming.

1034
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:47,210
Is there a problem? Should I call him?

1035
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:50,650
- No. No problem.
- Okay.

1036
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:04,850
"My heart's restless.."

1037
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:08,690
"I am waiting for you."

1038
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:14,650
"Ward off the jinx from you.."

1039
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:19,890
"..and chuck it away."

1040
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:25,490
"My heart's stuck on you."

1041
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:30,290
"There's no peace."

1042
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:39,570
"The dreams in my
eyes..keep shattering."

1043
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:47,370
"O beloved..you've hurt my heart."

1044
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:56,010
"O beloved..your
intentions were wrong."

1045
01:00:56,130 --> 01:01:06,370
"Your name make my lips shiver."

1046
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:15,170
"My vagabond beloved.
My crazy lover."

1047
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:19,380
"O beloved."

1048
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:28,650
"O beloved.."

1049
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:32,250
Raj, where the hell are you?

1050
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:34,170
How irresponsible can you be?

1051
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:37,730
Do you know the state I am in?

1052
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:39,770
How can you do this to me?

1053
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:41,290
I am so worried, Raj.

1054
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:42,970
You just disappeared.

1055
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:45,130
No phones. No messages.

1056
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:47,770
I called you number of times,
but no information.

1057
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:49,610
Couldn't you even call?

1058
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:53,370
In the last three days
I looked everywhere for you.

1059
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:55,650
Where are you?

1060
01:01:56,090 --> 01:01:57,210
Raj, I want to meet you.

1061
01:01:57,290 --> 01:01:59,010
I want to meet you now.

1062
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:00,930
You missed me a lot, didn't you?

1063
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:03,050
I..I can understand.

1064
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:05,450
You must be feeling horrible.

1065
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:06,810
I am sorry.

1066
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:09,330
I am-I am really sorry.

1067
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:13,410
There's a lot I want to say to you.

1068
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:16,290
But I can't say
everything on the phone.

1069
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:22,090
Why don't you..come over
to my bungalow in Madh!

1070
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:23,970
Yeah..

1071
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:25,570
..come soon.

1072
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:28,650
- Can't wait to see you.
- I am coming.

1073
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:31,010
I miss you.

1074
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:34,450
Can't wait to see you.

1075
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:16,490
"My parched life..wants
to get drenched in your love."

1076
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:21,610
"I've the entire world.."

1077
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:26,250
"..yet you're the one I miss."

1078
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:30,770
"I am incomplete.."

1079
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:33,250
"I am incomplete.."

1080
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:37,890
"I am incomplete..without you."

1081
01:03:57,490 --> 01:04:07,290
"You're making these moments..fiery."

1082
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:15,930
"I have been..craving for you."

1083
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:22,930
"My arms are waiting for you."

1084
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:27,250
"I have become your relief."

1085
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:34,610
"I can feel you..more than myself."

1086
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:36,930
"More than myself."

1087
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:39,610
"I am incomplete.."

1088
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:41,850
"I am incomplete.."

1089
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:46,570
"I am incomplete..without you."

1090
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:49,410
"I am incomplete.."

1091
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:51,730
"I am incomplete.."

1092
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:57,250
"I am incomplete..without you."

1093
01:05:15,850 --> 01:05:25,570
"I want to pick the
dew drops..from your lips."

1094
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:34,370
"And stay close to your body."

1095
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:45,570
"My body's so fiery..that
fuels you desire."

1096
01:05:45,970 --> 01:05:52,970
"I'm completely lost..in your refuge."

1097
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:55,370
"It's lost.

1098
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:57,970
"I am incomplete.."

1099
01:05:58,050 --> 01:06:00,250
"I am incomplete.."

1100
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:05,130
"I am incomplete..without you."

1101
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:07,650
"I am incomplete.."

1102
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:10,210
"I am incomplete.."

1103
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:15,010
"I am incomplete..without you."

1104
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:33,090
Who could it be at this hour?

1105
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:35,650
Wait here, I'll go check.

1106
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:42,930
Must be Monish.

1107
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:45,090
He's so restless.
Monish..

1108
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:46,450
- Hi
- Hi.

1109
01:06:47,490 --> 01:06:49,010
How did you like the surprise?

1110
01:06:49,490 --> 01:06:50,850
18th July, right?

1111
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:53,930
Good evening, son.

1112
01:06:54,930 --> 01:06:57,250
D-D-D-Dad, you.

1113
01:06:57,570 --> 01:06:59,730
When did you return
from your Europe trip?

1114
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:02,050
I didn't go there forever.

1115
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:06,450
As soon as I landed,
he brought me here straightaway.

1116
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:10,890
First time my son's arranged
for a huge celebration on my birthday.

1117
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:12,570
- Wow!
- Wow.

1118
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:14,170
What a romantic ambiance!

1119
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:16,770
But romantic ambiance on birthday?

1120
01:07:17,090 --> 01:07:18,290
Dad..

1121
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:21,370
- Happy birthday, dad.
- Great.

1122
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:23,010
Thank you, son.

1123
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:24,450
Thank you very much, son.

1124
01:07:25,490 --> 01:07:28,210
- Now he even goes to the office.
- I see.

1125
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:29,170
Yes, dad.

1126
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:32,650
- But son, why are you so scared?
- No, dad.

1127
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:33,690
Be relaxed.

1128
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:37,130
And I even heard that you really
impressed those Chinese delegates.

1129
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:39,770
- Wow! Very good.
- Yes.

1130
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:43,930
Sunaina. You here?

1131
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:00,330
And that vermillion on your forehead?

1132
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:12,930
Dad, Sunaina and I got married.

1133
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:24,530
Stop it, Raj.

1134
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:26,930
How much more are you going to drink?

1135
01:08:27,490 --> 01:08:28,330
Stop it now.

1136
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:30,650
Stop it? You want me to stop.

1137
01:08:31,770 --> 01:08:33,650
Why did you have to bring dad here?

1138
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:38,170
You know I don't get along with dad.

1139
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:40,450
I had to lie to him
that I married Sunaina.

1140
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,130
I am in a mess.

1141
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:44,610
Who says you're in a mess.

1142
01:08:44,770 --> 01:08:47,970
It's like you said, in 10
days Sunaina will be in your bed.

1143
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:50,530
And now not just for 10 days..

1144
01:08:50,610 --> 01:08:52,530
..Sunaina is all yours for 10 months,
10 years..10 generations.

1145
01:08:52,610 --> 01:08:53,730
Just shut up, okay.

1146
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:55,770
You played it dirty,
and you know that.

1147
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:57,610
Raj, I am sorry.

1148
01:08:58,410 --> 01:09:00,490
But you know we had a bet.

1149
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:02,650
And you won that bet.

1150
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:04,610
You're a winner, bro.

1151
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:06,450
You said..

1152
01:09:07,650 --> 01:09:11,530
..that if I lose this bet,
then I must pay you one rupee.

1153
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:14,650
Here's the money.

1154
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:19,170
There's no time to think.

1155
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:23,850
I will support Raj.

1156
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:33,410
If you want his happiness as well,
then just say yes.

1157
01:09:38,930 --> 01:09:42,410
Fine, then..make the preparations.

1158
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:47,130
Bless you.
Bless you. Now that's like my son.

1159
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:50,010
See you then.
I've things to do.

1160
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:54,130
Invite our relatives.
Make the preparations.

1161
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:05,530
Sunaina, you're crying.

1162
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:13,290
That's enough, dear.

1163
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:18,170
First wipe your tears.

1164
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:23,530
Now you're the daughter-in-law
of Malhotra family.

1165
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:26,970
I'll see to it that
you have a grand wedding.

1166
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:29,010
But..

1167
01:10:29,170 --> 01:10:30,850
I am telling you.

1168
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,650
Even your KK sir has agreed.

1169
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:38,490
My grandson has chosen you.

1170
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:41,410
I will get you two married.

1171
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:50,410
'Punjabi folk songs.'

1172
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:03,850
Monty.

1173
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:06,450
Congrats, Raj.

1174
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:08,370
- Hi, congratulations.
- Thank you.

1175
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:09,370
Thank you.

1176
01:11:10,570 --> 01:11:11,290
Yes.

1177
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:13,090
You're right,
they both look so good together.

1178
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:15,770
Gather around,
the engagement ceremony's beginning.

1179
01:11:15,970 --> 01:11:16,970
Yes.

1180
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:49,730
Thank you.

1181
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:51,370
Hello, congratulations.

1182
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:52,290
Hi.

1183
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:58,050
- Sir, this is Mr. Daljeet Singh.
- Hello.

1184
01:11:58,810 --> 01:11:59,690
Yes..

1185
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:01,330
Very good.

1186
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:03,250
Mr. Daljeet,
I am really pleased to meet you.

1187
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:05,890
- Right.
- KK..this isn't right.

1188
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:09,210
Why are you angry?

1189
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:12,330
Honestly speaking,
everything happened so soon..

1190
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:14,690
Otherwise how can we not invite him?

1191
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:17,570
I found out from Hansraj.

1192
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:20,690
I mean your son's wedding,
and I don't know.

1193
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:24,890
I am so sorry,
everything happened so quickly.

1194
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:27,530
And..this is just the engagement.

1195
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:29,330
You must attend the wedding.

1196
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:31,570
Look KK, big or small.

1197
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:34,570
I am going to attend the engagement,
the musical night..

1198
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:37,890
..and the.. What is it called?
The henna ceremony, all of them.

1199
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:39,890
Of course.

1200
01:12:40,210 --> 01:12:40,970
Hello.

1201
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:42,210
Hi, come on.

1202
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:43,450
Harry is here.

1203
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:47,210
Hello.

1204
01:12:49,210 --> 01:12:50,370
Congrats, Raj.

1205
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:59,090
Listen buddy..let's forget
what happened between us.

1206
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:02,290
- Hi.
- Congratulations.

1207
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:03,130
Thank you.

1208
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:04,450
- Hello.
- Hello.

1209
01:13:04,690 --> 01:13:05,930
- Hi, Sunaina.
- Hi.

1210
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:07,290
Congratulations.

1211
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:08,290
Thank you.

1212
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:11,850
I didn't know you're
actually getting married.

1213
01:13:12,610 --> 01:13:13,410
Come on.

1214
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:17,450
- That's like it.
- It's okay.

1215
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:20,130
- Let's take a picture.
- Come.

1216
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:24,470
Sister-in-law, congratulations.

1217
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:27,350
- How nice.
- Thank you.

1218
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:30,550
Let me introduce you.
This is Janki, Sunaina's mother.

1219
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:31,750
- Hello.
- Hello.

1220
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:33,470
- Congratulations..
- You too.

1221
01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:37,910
Come, Janki. Let me introduce
you to all the relatives.

1222
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:46,950
Let me introduce you, this is Shobha.

1223
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:47,990
She runs an NGO..

1224
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:49,510
- ..for the betterment of women.
- Hello.

1225
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:52,550
And this is Deepa. Raj's aunty.

1226
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:56,910
And this is Janki, Sunaina's mother.

1227
01:13:56,990 --> 01:13:58,630
Nice to meet you.

1228
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:01,430
Honestly speaking, you look
more like Sunaina's elder sister.

1229
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:05,350
Do you do Yoga?

1230
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:09,350
- Actually I teach dancing to kids.
- I see.

1231
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:12,990
It helps me pass time
and exercise as well.

1232
01:14:46,670 --> 01:14:48,070
What a plan?

1233
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:50,070
From Julie you became Janki..

1234
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:51,750
..and trying to get your
hands on a bigger share now.

1235
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:52,630
Wow!

1236
01:14:53,550 --> 01:14:56,510
How dare you try to have any kind
of relations with such rich people?

1237
01:14:56,590 --> 01:14:57,830
How dare you?

1238
01:14:58,070 --> 01:15:01,790
The daughter of a bar-dancer,
a sex-worker like you..

1239
01:15:01,950 --> 01:15:03,950
..is looking to be my
friend's daughter-in-law.

1240
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:05,230
I heard everything!

1241
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:15,510
It's a good thing I found
out everything on time.

1242
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:17,990
Please don't say that.

1243
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:20,430
- At least let me clarify..
- Be quiet!

1244
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:22,550
I don't want to hear anything.

1245
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:25,390
You and your daughter leave right now.

1246
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:29,390
Please..please don't do this.

1247
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:32,430
I kept my daughter
away from all this..

1248
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:34,630
..and gave her a good upbringing.

1249
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:35,990
Rajan, take her away.

1250
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:39,070
- Come on..your game's up.
- Leave me.

1251
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:40,030
Leave me!

1252
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:43,870
I won't go.
I will give up my life here.

1253
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:45,910
I won't allow this injustice.

1254
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:48,270
I won't let you break
this relationship.

1255
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:49,390
Did you two hear?

1256
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:50,830
I won't allow it.

1257
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:52,670
You won't listen like this.

1258
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:54,830
Now I will show you.

1259
01:15:54,910 --> 01:15:57,310
- Come with me. Come on!
- Please don't do this.

1260
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:59,950
- I will show you who you are?
- Please listen to me.

1261
01:16:00,230 --> 01:16:01,670
Don't do this. Please.

1262
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:03,590
Let me show everyone your real face.

1263
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:06,710
- Show them your ugly face.
- My daughter's life will be ruined.

1264
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:08,030
Now say what you want to say.

1265
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:10,550
Mom, what happened?

1266
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:13,550
KK sir, what the hell is happening?

1267
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:16,830
Shut up..and keep your voice down.

1268
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:21,750
Did you tell Raj about
your mother's background?

1269
01:16:22,990 --> 01:16:26,150
Raj, do you know about this.

1270
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:28,150
About what, dad?

1271
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:29,550
Then listen up everyone.

1272
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:32,870
I will show everyone..her real face!

1273
01:16:33,910 --> 01:16:35,750
She was a bar dancer!

1274
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:44,270
A sex-worker!

1275
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,070
What is he saying?

1276
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:58,750
Raj, try and understand.

1277
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:00,670
This is a very old thing.

1278
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:05,230
All this has nothing
to do with this relationship.

1279
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:08,950
My mom started a new life.

1280
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:11,310
Shouldn't we encourage
a person like this?

1281
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:15,830
Listen, Raj.

1282
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:20,630
Don't humiliate us like
this in front of everyone.

1283
01:17:21,190 --> 01:17:24,910
A bar dancer..sex-worker.

1284
01:17:26,870 --> 01:17:28,990
And you want us to forget your past..

1285
01:17:29,550 --> 01:17:30,950
..and let you make a fool of us.

1286
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:32,630
That won't happen.

1287
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:35,790
If someone wants to
make her life better..

1288
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:37,190
Just shut up.

1289
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:39,390
No one wants to listen to you.

1290
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:41,670
And anyway, dad.

1291
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:43,710
I made a bet with Monish.

1292
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:46,270
Otherwise..she is no match for us.

1293
01:17:47,150 --> 01:17:48,670
This is was just a charade.

1294
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:51,990
And after that,
I am not interested in her.

1295
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:58,310
You're such a lowlife!

1296
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:04,190
"My past won't let you live."

1297
01:19:04,350 --> 01:19:07,670
"I can't see you in pain, dear."

1298
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:10,680
"So I am willingly..going
far away from you."

1299
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:16,510
I can't see you like this, Sunaina.

1300
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:19,990
You won't understand, Daniele.

1301
01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:24,270
Can't you just forget all this?
Start a new life?

1302
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:26,190
Haven't you had enough?

1303
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:29,950
There's so much more
in life than this.

1304
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:32,430
We can start something new together.

1305
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:34,150
Think about it, Sunaina.

1306
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:38,190
I can't forget.

1307
01:19:43,390 --> 01:19:45,070
You've been so sweet to me.

1308
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:48,550
You're the only one supporting me.

1309
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:53,470
But I am just not ready to commit.

1310
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:59,390
There's still something
that..I need to do.

1311
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:03,430
I am sorry.

1312
01:20:06,230 --> 01:20:07,030
Okay.

1313
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:24,030
Here you go, buddy.

1314
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:30,950
KK..finally I caught you.

1315
01:20:31,390 --> 01:20:33,950
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Cheers.

1316
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:37,470
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, come-come-come.

1317
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:43,150
Hey..this is my pretty looking
darling daughter Sanjana.

1318
01:20:43,790 --> 01:20:44,870
Recognize him?

1319
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:47,110
KK uncle.

1320
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:50,030
He used to cuddle you in
his arms when you were a kid.

1321
01:20:50,150 --> 01:20:51,710
- Hello, uncle.
- Hello, dear.

1322
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:53,670
Where are you going?

1323
01:20:53,910 --> 01:20:54,710
I am sorry, dad.

1324
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:56,710
Actually I've to go for Liza's party.

1325
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,390
So could you excuse me?

1326
01:20:59,390 --> 01:21:01,550
- Could you please excuse me?
- When are you going to come back?

1327
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,710
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

1328
01:21:04,510 --> 01:21:05,790
What can I say?

1329
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:08,750
You're my darling, papa.

1330
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:10,670
You're the world's best papa.

1331
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:12,670
- Bye.
- Have fun, enjoy.

1332
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:17,830
- Kids grow up so soon.
- Yeah.

1333
01:21:18,470 --> 01:21:19,750
How are things with you?

1334
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:22,790
What do I say?

1335
01:21:23,710 --> 01:21:25,270
Nothing's hidden anymore.

1336
01:21:25,670 --> 01:21:27,110
You know it too.

1337
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:29,230
Business is in doldrums.

1338
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:31,590
Everything's in deficit.

1339
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:35,430
How much?

1340
01:21:36,190 --> 01:21:37,270
200 million?

1341
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:38,710
250 million?

1342
01:21:39,370 --> 01:21:40,390
1 billion?

1343
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:43,150
Your friend's still alive.

1344
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:44,910
Speak up.

1345
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:49,230
No..this isn't right.

1346
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:51,550
I have an idea.

1347
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:55,430
My daughter Sanjana..

1348
01:21:58,270 --> 01:22:01,150
She's my responsibility
and my tension.

1349
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:03,390
And your son Raj.

1350
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:07,510
Why don't we get these two married?

1351
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:13,110
Your tension will be my tension,
and my tension will be yours.

1352
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:16,990
What say?

1353
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:22,590
Isn't this drink just great?

1354
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:27,830
It turned our friendship
into a relation, KK.

1355
01:23:03,070 --> 01:23:06,810
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

1356
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:34,910
Hi.

1357
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:42,630
Meet Raj.

1358
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:48,570
Yes, my fiancé.

1359
01:23:48,710 --> 01:23:50,510
Hey, you lucky man.

1360
01:23:54,150 --> 01:23:55,910
Come on, let's go to the bar.

1361
01:23:57,290 --> 01:23:57,990
Come on.

1362
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:02,870
Hey..

1363
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,430
- Some coke?
- No.

1364
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:10,790
- Or something harder.
- I'll have a scotch.

1365
01:24:11,510 --> 01:24:12,710
- Scotch.
- Yup.

1366
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:16,510
- Andre.
- Yes.

1367
01:24:16,770 --> 01:24:17,560
Scotch.

1368
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:21,790
- Enjoy, buddy.
- You too.

1369
01:24:26,910 --> 01:24:27,790
Take you drink.

1370
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:57,160
Hey, where's Sanjana?
My fiancé.

1371
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:34,750
"O beloved.."

1372
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:40,070
Yes.

1373
01:27:40,190 --> 01:27:41,830
Raj sir's here, madam.

1374
01:27:45,630 --> 01:27:46,910
Wait, I am coming.

1375
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:48,270
Sunaina.

1376
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:50,830
Sunaina.

1377
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:52,430
Call, Sunaina.

1378
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:56,270
- Sir..
- Raj.

1379
01:27:57,710 --> 01:27:58,710
Raj.

1380
01:27:59,950 --> 01:28:01,150
Raj, come inside.

1381
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:03,430
Carefully. Come on.

1382
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:06,430
- Raj please..
- Just a minute.

1383
01:28:06,790 --> 01:28:08,550
- Carefully.
- Just a minute.

1384
01:28:08,670 --> 01:28:12,000
Come on.
Carefully.

1385
01:28:12,270 --> 01:28:13,410
Raj.

1386
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:18,230
Careful.
Come on.

1387
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:22,070
Here.
Make him sit here.

1388
01:28:28,830 --> 01:28:29,630
Sunaina.

1389
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:36,150
- Open the guest room.
- Yes, ma'am.

1390
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:37,790
- And look after him.
- Yes, ma'am.

1391
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:42,430
Hello.

1392
01:28:42,710 --> 01:28:43,830
Sunaina ma'am..

1393
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:46,830
..I want to tell you
about a deal of KK Exports.

1394
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:51,070
I don't want any more information.

1395
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:54,630
Do not call me again.

1396
01:29:03,070 --> 01:29:05,990
What's wrong with Sunaina now?

1397
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:41,190
"Spend these
moments..with me tonight."

1398
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:48,270
"Tease your sleep away..and
stay awake with me."

1399
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:56,390
"Let me touch your lips with mine."

1400
01:29:56,790 --> 01:29:59,110
"Give me love."

1401
01:29:59,270 --> 01:30:02,750
"Give me love."

1402
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:10,030
"Let me come closer."

1403
01:30:11,230 --> 01:30:13,590
"Give me love."

1404
01:30:13,670 --> 01:30:17,270
"Give me love."

1405
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:24,470
"Let me bring you closer to me."

1406
01:30:57,870 --> 01:31:05,150
"I want to burn gradually.."

1407
01:31:05,230 --> 01:31:11,630
"..in your heat."

1408
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:19,190
"All the inhibitions in my heart.."

1409
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:26,110
"..let me give it all to you."

1410
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:33,470
"Let me touch your lips with mine."

1411
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:36,350
"Give me love."

1412
01:31:36,430 --> 01:31:39,870
"Give me love."

1413
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:46,510
"Let me come closer."

1414
01:31:48,310 --> 01:31:50,780
"Give me love."

1415
01:31:50,950 --> 01:31:54,430
"Give me love."

1416
01:31:54,510 --> 01:32:02,110
"Let me bring you closer to me."

1417
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:41,750
"Walk with me for miles.."

1418
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:49,000
"..with your breath
entwined with mine."

1419
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:56,280
"Let's complete journey first,
and then you can stop."

1420
01:32:56,760 --> 01:33:03,390
"At my threshold."

1421
01:33:03,470 --> 01:33:10,750
"Let me touch your lips with mine."

1422
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:13,510
"Give me love."

1423
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:17,110
"Give me love."

1424
01:33:17,270 --> 01:33:24,910
"Let me come closer."

1425
01:33:25,390 --> 01:33:27,990
"Give me love."

1426
01:33:28,070 --> 01:33:30,870
"Give me love."

1427
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:38,590
"Let me bring you closer to me."

1428
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,250
Hello.

1429
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,440
Who is this? Where is Raj?

1430
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:10,280
He isn't here. But who are you?

1431
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:13,670
I am Sanjana, his fiancée.
But who are you?

1432
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:18,120
Sunaina.

1433
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:21,800
Who Sunaina?

1434
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:23,760
His first love.

1435
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:26,520
What? Shut up, you..

1436
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:35,800
Dad!

1437
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:37,480
Dad!

1438
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:40,040
What happened, dear? What?

1439
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:41,520
Leave me, dad.

1440
01:35:41,790 --> 01:35:44,200
That Raj, who does he think he is.

1441
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:45,320
What did he do?

1442
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:48,360
How dare he? He's ignoring my calls.

1443
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:50,080
My calls, how dare he.

1444
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:51,880
So he ignored your calls,
that's all right.

1445
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,360
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

1446
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:57,040
- After our engagement, I threw a party.
- Yes.

1447
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:59,080
He's been missing since
then with some girl.

1448
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:01,600
How do you know he's with a girl?
Which girl?

1449
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,120
- Some Sunaina, dad.
- Sunaina, who?

1450
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:06,160
She answered Raj's phone.

1451
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:08,920
Fine, calm..calm down..

1452
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,480
Dad, I don't want
to get married anymore.

1453
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:13,040
You please keep him away from me.

1454
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:15,000
I just can't stand
this guy anymore, dad.

1455
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:16,760
- Look, dear.
- Nobody loves me.

1456
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:18,640
- Even you don't love me.
- No.. no..

1457
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:20,680
- Nobody loves me.
- I love you, dear.

1458
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,360
- I love you, dear.
- Nobody loves me.

1459
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,360
I love you the most.

1460
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:29,400
- Here you go.
- Keep it here.

1461
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,200
- Anything else?
- You can go.

1462
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:32,200
Okay-okay.

1463
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:34,040
Don't worry, Kapoor.

1464
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:36,640
Don't worry.
I'll deal with this personally.

1465
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:38,600
I'll talk to Raj..

1466
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:40,840
..you can't break relationships
over such trivial things.

1467
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:42,920
Okay-okay.

1468
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:47,960
What's wrong? What did Kapoor say?

1469
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:49,280
It's just as I feared.

1470
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:51,000
Raj's completely humiliated us.

1471
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,840
He's back with that Sunaina again.

1472
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:56,320
Don't worry, I will talk to Raj.

1473
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:57,120
No.

1474
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,720
You won't say anything to him.

1475
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:02,200
Now I will speak with him personally.

1476
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,880
I will deal with him.

1477
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:07,360
At least finish your tea.

1478
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:12,160
KK sir.

1479
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:15,200
Why are you standing? Please, sit.

1480
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:16,440
Oh just shut up.

1481
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:18,200
I didn't come here to sit.

1482
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:19,920
What do you want?

1483
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:21,760
You've ruined everything.

1484
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:23,720
Leave my son alone.

1485
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:30,480
Sir, I was really sad..to
hear about your health.

1486
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:34,760
If you don't mind me asking,
honestly without offending you..

1487
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:36,740
..if there's anything
I can do for you..

1488
01:37:36,820 --> 01:37:38,120
I don't want anything!

1489
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:39,440
Call Raj.

1490
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:42,760
Yes.

1491
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:49,800
Yes, dad.

1492
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:55,000
You're so high..that
you've been going around..

1493
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,040
..with the same person that ruined us.

1494
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:59,320
It's all because of her..

1495
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:00,480
It's all because of her..

1496
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:03,400
..that the Kapoor family
severed all ties with us.

1497
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:12,540
Dad. We shouldn't
have rejected Sunaina.

1498
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:18,000
She's been through so much hatred.

1499
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:20,160
But now..

1500
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,200
Now I am with her.

1501
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:25,360
Forever and ever.

1502
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:36,970
Go away, dad.

1503
01:38:37,910 --> 01:38:39,560
You never understood me..

1504
01:38:40,240 --> 01:38:42,100
..and you will never
understand Sunaina either.

1505
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:47,640
You shouldn't have
spoken to him like that.

1506
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,120
It's not right.

1507
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:56,680
Nothing is right.

1508
01:38:58,480 --> 01:38:59,720
- It's not right.
- Sunaina.

1509
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:02,320
It's not right.

1510
01:39:13,610 --> 01:39:14,640
Its okay, Sunaina.

1511
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:16,640
It will all be fine.

1512
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:24,880
Okay guys, we all raise our glasses
for our very own Raj Malhotra..

1513
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:29,720
..who has at last found his soul-mate,
his lady love.

1514
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:32,800
Well..love is beyond my understanding.

1515
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:36,400
Why don't you tell us
about this real-sublime love?

1516
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:38,480
So come on, guys.

1517
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,360
Put your hand together
for Raj Malhotra.

1518
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:43,320
All to you man.

1519
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:45,720
Thank you, guys.

1520
01:39:46,670 --> 01:39:48,000
Where do I begin?

1521
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:53,000
Now I finally understood
what true love is.

1522
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:54,560
And..

1523
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:58,960
What started as a bet,
as a deceit, a game..

1524
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:03,400
..soon turned into love
without me even realizing it.

1525
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:05,320
And today she is with me.

1526
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:07,040
I just feel on top of the world.

1527
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,920
- So cheers to that.
- Cheers to that!

1528
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:12,230
- Cheers.
- Cheers

1529
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:18,720
Raj, I've already reached here.

1530
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:21,640
We were supposed
to have dinner together.

1531
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:22,560
What happened?

1532
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:25,280
Oh, God. Sunaina, I completely forgot.

1533
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:26,840
I am on my way.

1534
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:30,000
Sorry guys, got to go.

1535
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:32,800
But this party will
continue tomorrow, okay.

1536
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:34,120
See you, buddy. See you.

1537
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:35,840
I mean he just left.

1538
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:38,680
He's already a henpecked
husband even before the wedding.

1539
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:40,960
Raj was never like this.

1540
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:43,600
- Anyway, cheers to that.
- Yes.

1541
01:40:47,910 --> 01:40:50,000
Hey, brother-in-law.

1542
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:53,880
- You really took Sunaina for a spin.
- Monish, you here?

1543
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:56,040
You changed the entire scene.

1544
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:59,040
I must admit..what a move.

1545
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:02,240
- Hats off to you, brother. Hats off.
- What nonsense.

1546
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:05,200
Whether anyone
understands this or not..

1547
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:07,280
..but I understand
your move really well.

1548
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:11,080
You see..this love and other things,
it was just an excuse.

1549
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:13,880
Actually..you wanted
to get your hands..

1550
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:16,520
..on Sunaina's wealth
and her entire business.

1551
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:18,440
Give me a hug! Give me a hug!

1552
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:21,600
Bro, I think you've had enough.

1553
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:23,920
- But..
- And you keep guessing.

1554
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:26,000
We're going to party tonight.

1555
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:28,560
Keep guessing.

1556
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:30,880
Keep guessing.

1557
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:34,320
Keep guessing. Great.

1558
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,280
He's such a smart operator.

1559
01:41:56,520 --> 01:42:00,880
"My arms are waiting for you."

1560
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:05,240
"I have become your relief."

1561
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:12,680
"I can feel you..more than myself."

1562
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:15,080
"More than myself."

1563
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:17,640
"I am incomplete.."

1564
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:20,000
"I am incomplete.."

1565
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:24,640
"I am incomplete..without you."

1566
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:27,040
- Hello.
- I am on my way.

1567
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:28,120
I'll see you soon.

1568
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:35,200
"I am incomplete..without you."

1569
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:25,120
Wow. Sunaina,
what a pleasant surprise.

1570
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:29,200
And you're looking gorgeous as ever.

1571
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:32,200
The same dress..

1572
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:35,000
..the candles.

1573
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:38,880
How could I forget this day?

1574
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:42,640
But you remembered.

1575
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:46,480
18th July, how can I forget?

1576
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:48,320
How can I forget?

1577
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:50,880
Yes, Sunaina. 18th July.

1578
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:53,680
It was the beginning of our love.

1579
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:56,440
Do you have more surprises for me?

1580
01:43:58,240 --> 01:43:59,320
Just wait and watch.

1581
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:02,960
Oh Sunaina,
I am so lucky to have you in my life.

1582
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:06,680
I mean..I am alive only
because of you, Sunaina.

1583
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:09,240
I love you, Sunaina. I truly love you.

1584
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:11,920
What's the matter, Raj?

1585
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:14,600
You're a bit too loving today.

1586
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:16,240
Sunaina..

1587
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:19,480
..I am so happy today
I just can't describe myself.

1588
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:23,000
You know..for the
first time in my life..

1589
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:24,480
..I've realized what true love is.

1590
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:26,960
And I didn't realize
when I fell in love with you.

1591
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:28,240
I just..

1592
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:29,560
I just can't believe it, Sunaina.

1593
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:30,960
I just can't believe it.

1594
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:39,320
You have to believe it. I did too.

1595
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:41,800
Remember? Or did you forget?

1596
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:47,760
You got so romantic, and remember
what you said with enthusiasm?

1597
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:50,280
Remember?

1598
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:54,080
When I completely trusted you.

1599
01:44:54,680 --> 01:45:00,240
I didn't know..it was
just a big charade for you.

1600
01:45:01,140 --> 01:45:03,110
'And anyway, dad.
I made a bet with Monish.'

1601
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:05,080
'Otherwise..she is no match for us.'

1602
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:08,480
A planned unscrupulous game of deceit.

1603
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:12,280
Just to win a bet, to take me to bed.

1604
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:14,640
Raj..

1605
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:18,400
..today you're the loser.

1606
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:22,720
But Sunaina, try to understand.

1607
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:25,760
No, Raj. It's my day.

1608
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:29,000
Sunaina, forget about the past.

1609
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:30,200
Things are better now.

1610
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:31,800
Everything has changed now.

1611
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:33,200
No, Raj.

1612
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:35,720
The change will come now. After today.

1613
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:37,760
Sunaina, what are you saying?

1614
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:38,920
What's wrong with you?

1615
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:40,600
Everything is perfect between us.

1616
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:41,400
I love you.

1617
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,080
And you love me too, Sunaina.

1618
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:44,240
Forget all this.

1619
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:45,240
Hello, Raj.

1620
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:49,280
Surely you need a drink.

1621
01:45:50,120 --> 01:45:51,040
Come on.

1622
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:54,280
Bring me your glass, Mr. Raj Malhotra.

1623
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:56,160
Sunaina, what is he doing here?

1624
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:58,000
What the hell is he doing in my house?

1625
01:45:58,400 --> 01:45:59,480
Your house?

1626
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:01,840
Raj..

1627
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:06,000
..you always drink so much.

1628
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:08,360
First mistake.

1629
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:12,240
You forgot,
as a gift for your first love.

1630
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:15,480
You gave me this house.

1631
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:22,600
I am sorry Raj,
what kind of love was this..

1632
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:26,280
..which drove my mother
to commit suicide?

1633
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:30,080
And I had nowhere to go to.

1634
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:32,960
I lost everything.

1635
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:37,840
And the Sunaina that truly loved you.

1636
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:41,960
You killed that Sunaina,
along with my mother.

1637
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:47,280
And now you came back to
me looking for that Sunaina again.

1638
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:54,680
Raj, your love was
always a lie and deceitful.

1639
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:10,840
This innocent face..sweet talks..

1640
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:14,960
The pretence of love..

1641
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:17,920
It was all to take revenge, right?

1642
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:19,760
Right?

1643
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:30,480
Security! Security!

1644
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:31,680
I won't leave you.

1645
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:34,480
Security! Security!

1646
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:36,240
I won't leave you, Sunaina.

1647
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:38,720
I will kill you.

1648
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:42,560
I will kill you.

1649
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:45,000
I won't leave you, Sunaina.

1650
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:58,640
If you're not mine,
then you can't be anyone else'.

1651
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:37,160
They think I am crazy.

1652
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:39,200
They say that you don't love me.

1653
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:41,280
You won't leave me, Sunaina.

1654
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:43,320
Sunaina, you know I love you.

1655
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:44,880
I can't live without you.

1656
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,320
And I know you will come back to me.

1657
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:48,760
No, it's nothing.

1658
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:50,280
She is just angry.

1659
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:53,000
But I will convince her. Yes.

1660
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:57,120
Sunaina..why do you keep leaving me?

1661
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:03,160
You left me again, Sunaina.

1662
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:05,680
Why did you leave me again, Sunaina?

1663
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:10,400
I will love you all my life, Sunaina.
Please come back.

1664
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:11,240
Please.

1665
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:12,440
Sunaina is coming.

1666
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:15,240
I do come sometimes for a walk..

1667
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:17,160
- Mister..look..
- What happened?

1668
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:19,000
- Sunaina is coming.
- Sunaina.

1669
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:20,920
She loves me a lot.

1670
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,080
- Sunaina.
- Where is she?

1671
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:25,200
Sunaina is coming.

1672
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:27,120
- Where is Sunaina?
- I love her.

1673
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:28,320
I think he's crazy.

1674
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:30,000
Come, Sunaina. Come, sit.

1675
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:32,840
That innocent face..your sweet talks..

1676
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:34,560
I miss all of it so much.

1677
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:36,520
'And anyway, dad.
I made a bet with Monish.'

1678
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:39,160
'And after that,
I am not interested in her.'

1679
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:41,600
'A sex-worker.'

1680
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:45,560
'Sex-worker.'

1681
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:57,200
"I am incomplete.."

1682
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:59,640
"I am incomplete.."

1683
01:50:04,700 --> 01:50:05,680
Let's go.

1684
01:50:45,950 --> 01:50:48,150
"Come hug me..take me in your arms."

1685
01:50:48,230 --> 01:50:50,470
"Don't deceive my heart from afar."

1686
01:50:50,550 --> 01:50:52,790
"Come hug me..take me in your arms."

1687
01:50:52,870 --> 01:50:55,070
"Don't deceive my heart from afar."

1688
01:50:55,150 --> 01:50:57,390
"My heartbeat's got no drive,
beloved."

1689
01:50:57,470 --> 01:51:01,070
"Hold my heart tight, beloved."

1690
01:51:02,070 --> 01:51:06,590
"Every inch of my body
craves for your love."

1691
01:51:06,670 --> 01:51:08,870
"Come hug me..take me in your arms."

1692
01:51:08,950 --> 01:51:11,190
"Don't deceive my heart from afar."

1693
01:51:11,270 --> 01:51:13,510
"Come hug me..take me in your arms."

1694
01:51:13,590 --> 01:51:15,670
"Don't deceive my heart from afar."

1695
01:51:15,750 --> 01:51:18,110
"Your earrings shine."

1696
01:51:18,190 --> 01:51:20,390
"Your waist sways like lightening."

1697
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:22,710
"You shine so brightly.."

1698
01:51:22,790 --> 01:51:24,910
"..even the stars blink at you."

1699
01:51:24,990 --> 01:51:27,350
"Your earrings shine."

1700
01:51:27,430 --> 01:51:29,630
"Your waist sways like lightening."

1701
01:51:29,710 --> 01:51:31,950
"You shine so brightly.."

1702
01:51:32,030 --> 01:51:34,910
"..even the stars blink at you."

1703
01:51:44,070 --> 01:51:46,350
"I want to spend
a love-filled night.."

1704
01:51:46,430 --> 01:51:48,710
"..only with you."

1705
01:51:48,870 --> 01:51:53,390
"I swear..I'll do as you say."

1706
01:51:53,470 --> 01:51:57,550
"I am crazy about
your deceitful love."

1707
01:51:57,950 --> 01:52:02,510
"You're the only
guy I am interested in."

1708
01:52:02,590 --> 01:52:04,750
"Everyone's watching..can't you see."

1709
01:52:04,830 --> 01:52:06,790
"Come on baby, go crazy."

1710
01:52:07,070 --> 01:52:08,790
"Leave all inhibitions, be free"

1711
01:52:08,870 --> 01:52:10,950
"Take me in your arms, and be mine."

1712
01:52:11,030 --> 01:52:13,390
"Come hug me..take me in your arms."

1713
01:52:13,470 --> 01:52:15,750
"Don't deceive my heart from afar."

1714
01:52:15,830 --> 01:52:18,030
"Come hug me..take me in your arms."

1715
01:52:18,110 --> 01:52:20,230
"Don't deceive my heart from afar."

1716
01:52:20,310 --> 01:52:22,630
"Your earrings shine."

1717
01:52:22,710 --> 01:52:24,910
"Your waist sways like lightening."

1718
01:52:24,990 --> 01:52:27,230
"You shine so brightly.."

1719
01:52:27,310 --> 01:52:30,150
"..even the stars blink at you."

1720
01:52:39,510 --> 01:52:44,070
"Drink few drops of
my intoxicating love."

1721
01:52:44,150 --> 01:52:48,630
"And let your intentions sway."

1722
01:52:48,710 --> 01:52:53,150
"Love me..don't leave any dearth."

1723
01:52:53,230 --> 01:52:57,710
"Let your heart be one..with mine."

1724
01:52:57,790 --> 01:53:00,030
"Forget the world.."

1725
01:53:00,110 --> 01:53:02,110
"Come baby, me and you."

1726
01:53:02,350 --> 01:53:04,110
"Play it cool, watch the show."

1727
01:53:04,190 --> 01:53:06,390
"Let the world talk if they want to."

1728
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:08,710
"Come hug me..take me in your arms."

1729
01:53:08,790 --> 01:53:10,990
"Don't deceive my heart from afar."

1730
01:53:11,070 --> 01:53:13,310
"Come hug me..take me in your arms."

1731
01:53:13,390 --> 01:53:15,590
"Don't deceive my heart from afar."

1732
01:53:15,710 --> 01:53:17,910
"Your earrings shine."

1733
01:53:17,990 --> 01:53:20,030
"Your waist sways like lightening."

1734
01:53:20,310 --> 01:53:22,510
"Come hug me..take me in your arms."

1735
01:53:22,590 --> 01:53:25,390
"Don't deceive my heart from afar."

1736
01:53:58,910 --> 01:54:05,950
"I want to burn gradually.."

1737
01:54:06,230 --> 01:54:12,670
"..in your heat."

1738
01:54:13,310 --> 01:54:20,190
"All the inhibitions in my heart.."

1739
01:54:20,550 --> 01:54:26,470
"..let me give it all to you."

1740
01:54:27,150 --> 01:54:34,310
"Let me touch your lips with mine."

1741
01:54:34,790 --> 01:54:37,230
"Give me love."

1742
01:54:37,390 --> 01:54:40,190
"Give me love."

1743
01:54:41,030 --> 01:54:48,030
"Let me come closer."

1744
01:54:49,190 --> 01:54:51,670
"Give me love."

1745
01:54:51,790 --> 01:54:55,190
"Give me love."

1746
01:54:55,430 --> 01:55:03,190
"Let me bring you closer to me."

1747
01:55:36,210 --> 01:55:42,940
"Walk with me for miles.."
