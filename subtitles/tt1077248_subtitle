1
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,195
 As you entered the room. .
 what happened?

2
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,398
 What did you do with the girl?

3
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,133
 Speak up!

4
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,402
 Why are you guys after me?

5
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:39,403
 Because we are flamboyant
 old people!

6
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,240
 Now tell us! What all things
 you did on your honeymoon!

7
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,087
 It's not for us.

8
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:58,088
 Sir, earlier he used to get so
 scared just hearing about marriage.

9
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:01,591
 Now. . in 10 days he
 has become smart!

10
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:05,097
 I asked him. Where will you
 go for your honeymoon?

11
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,099
 Goa, Mahabaleshwar, Panchgani?

12
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,233
 Do you know what he says?

13
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:11,234
 He says now I just have to remain
 in the room for 7 days.

14
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,420
 Hi!
 - Where are you?

15
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,056
 I have crossed Solapur.

16
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,057
 6-7 hours more. What are you doing?

17
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,394
 I am making coffee. I wanted
 to hear your voice.

18
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,529
 So I called you.

19
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,465
 Is that so?
 - Say something!

20
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,567
 What do I say?
 - What have you worn?

21
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,036
 Pink Salwar Kameez (Indian
 Traditional Attire)!

22
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,138
 And what's the colour of your. .
 - Vikram!

23
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,139
 Honey, tell me!

24
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,078
 Black! - Ma'am, I was asking
 the colour of your bus!

25
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,349
 Orange! Why?

26
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,539
 Hey!

27
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,642
 "Come on! Come on!"

28
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,044
 Hey! Why did you stop
 the bus? Are you drunk?

29
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,279
 Is this girl in your bus?

30
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,314
 What happened, sir?
 - Look properly!

31
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,049
 Yes, sir! Seat number 22!

32
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,251
 Is she alone or is somebody with
 her? - She is alone, sir!

33
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,220
 Bring her out! And bring
 her luggage too!

34
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,221
 And don't tell anybody!
 - Okay, sir!

35
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:52,658
 What happened?

36
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,659
 It's a police officer! He
 is asking for a girl!

37
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,063
 Come!

38
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:01,064
 Vikram?
 - At your service!

39
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:04,534
 Before leaving I had told you!
 Either leave me or this gang!

40
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,208
 For a month I wasn't here. But
 what did you do, Vikram?

41
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,410
 Nothing! Nothing!

42
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,346
 Just try and understand. I
 can't leave just like that.

43
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:17,249
 I need more time. And why
 are you calling them gang?

44
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,250
 We do business! I am not
 doing any illegal work!

45
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,488
 Is that so? So is that gambling
 den not illegal?

46
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,457
 Den? It's a club! Damn it!

47
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,327
 You people even give bribe to the
 police. 4 lakhs every month.

48
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,328
 So what if some gambling goes
 on there? Life is a gamble.

49
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:35,098
 I think my luck is bad!

50
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,369
 Its okay! I will pack!
 - No, no!

51
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,104
 Bye, Vikram! Its okay!
 - Sit!

52
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,372
 Bye, Vikram! Please!
 - Sit!

53
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,373
 Let me go! Please!
 - Sit!

54
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,311
 I can't eat 2 pizzas alone!

55
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,182
 Do you love me? Or it's
 just time pass for you?

56
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:57,053
 I came here from Mumbai just
 so that I wile time. .

57
00:05:57,056 --> 00:06:00,056
 . .for 2 hours in a cheap
 room in this cheap hotel!

58
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:18,007
 I. .

59
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,213
 A. M . .

60
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:35,091
 Sorry!

61
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,172
 Where are the goods? - I don't know.

62
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,043
 I don't know. - You're lying to me.

63
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,313
 I don't know. I don't know.

64
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,050
 Don't you know? - I'll tell you.
 I'll tell you.

65
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,196
 Sir, 2 boxes!

66
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:14,197
 Sir, Michael Joseph's case closed.

67
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,468
 We have found a box too!

68
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,636
 Hello! Hello! Hello!

69
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,637
 Mike testing! Hello! Hello!
 - What are you doing?

70
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,041
 I want to record your voice!

71
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:25,410
 Why? Will you hear
 it after my death?

72
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:28,079
 Why do you always talk nonsense!

73
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,348
 Say something. Sing something.
 - What?

74
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,350
 Anything!
 - What anything?

75
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,351
 Sing! Come here!
 - Sesho!

76
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,589
 Sesho!
 - Now sing a sweet song!

77
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,461
 Fine!

78
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,462
 "Coyness pulls one hand."

79
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:49,432
 "Love the other."

80
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:55,004
 "Coyness pulls one hand."

81
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:59,075
 "Love the other."

82
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:03,046
 "Where should I go? I don't know."

83
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:06,549
 "Somebody tell me."

84
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,322
 "Take my fair complexion."

85
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:16,059
 "Give me dark complexion."

86
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:20,063
 "I will hide in the twilight."

87
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,333
 "Give me my beloved's company."

88
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,537
 "The moon peeps from the cloud."

89
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,608
 "May you be eclipsed."

90
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,079
 "It smiles making me feel envious."

91
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,021
 "Take my fair complexion."

92
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,025
 "Give me dark complexion."

93
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,428
 "I will hide in the twilight."

94
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,033
 "Give me my beloved's company."

95
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,471
 "I have lost something after
 gaining something."

96
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,042
 "Some. ."

97
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,043
 Pick up the phone, Seshu!

98
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,052
 Hello!

99
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,053
 Mr. Seshadri! I have got hold
 of a nice French furniture.

100
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,058
 Do you or your friends need it?

101
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,329
 It's worth 5. I will give
 it to you for 2. 5.

102
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,330
 But. . the deal should be
 made in the next week.

103
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,568
 Yes. Of course I want it.

104
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,569
 I will confirm it tomorrow.

105
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,098
 Sir, if the good is nice. . then I
 can sell it for more than 5 crores.

106
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,569
 That too within 2 days.

107
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,339
 There is no problem.
 I have many contacts.

108
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,340
 But sir. . why to involve the others?

109
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,410
 We can fix the deal between
 ourselves. 2. 5 crores each.

110
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,381
 Shardul! I could have done
 this deal alone too!

111
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,120
 Sir, I was joking!

112
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,123
 I will call all the partners.

113
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,394
 Tomorrow the meeting will
 be at Prakash's office.

114
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,798
 Prakash-bhai! Say something!
 Say something!

115
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,200
 I have been coming here
 for so many months!

116
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,602
 If I had cheated, then I
 would have been caught!

117
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,138
 He didn't ask me anything! Directly
 he started beating me!

118
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,107
 And he! I don't even know him!

119
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,541
 His name, address, I
 don't know anything!

120
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,243
 I don't know how he came
 and sat besides me!

121
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,544
 I think he must have done it!

122
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,413
 He must have done everything,
 Prakash-bhai!

123
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,148
 Hey! Shut up!

124
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,150
 Look! Look! Prakash-bhai,
 say something!

125
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,284
 I have some respect in the market.

126
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,285
 Shut up! Pick one!

127
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:08,031
 Diesel, you pick one!

128
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:18,074
 If the card is between the
 two, I will spare you.

129
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,577
 Otherwise you will be thrashed.

130
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:22,113
 Pick one again!
 - Come on! Come on!

131
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,382
 Prakash-bhai, you don't trust me?

132
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,383
 You talk too much! You play
 less! Pick one! Come on!

133
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,457
 Show! Show!

134
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,193
 If I am a cheater, I could have
 chosen any card, Prakash-bhai!

135
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,328
 Prakash-bhai!
 - Come on!

136
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:40,329
 Prakash-bhai! Prakash-bhai!

137
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,534
 1, 2, 3! Come! The season is lovely!

138
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:48,006
 Diesel! Now you pick one!

139
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:51,007
 Come on!

140
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,548
 I give you another chance!

141
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,616
 But Prakash-bhai, you said. .
 - Hey!

142
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:01,617
 Can't you read? Look!
 What is written there!

143
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:16,099
 Now pick one between the two.
 And I will let you go.

144
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,615
 Keep him at Ganja's table.

145
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,117
 Ganja is making loads of money.

146
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,185
 Now you will play on behalf
 of the company!

147
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:35,620
 Go, Diesel!
 - Yes, sir!

148
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,188
 Go and play! Best of luck!

149
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,323
 Sir, shall we let him go?

150
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,058
 Akram! The one who has
 God's blessing. .

151
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,059
 . .you shouldn't doubt him!

152
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,497
 "Paths of life are lovely."

153
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:54,537
 "Paths of life are lovely."

154
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,076
 Where are you, Mr. Naidu?

155
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:01,077
 I am posted in crime branch!
 Now again. . cigarettes!

156
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,481
 No! I gave it up!
 - Oh my God! This is great!

157
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:06,482
 14 days, 8 hours, 30 minutes!

158
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,155
 The club is working fine.

159
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,524
 Shardul was saying
 its incurring loss.

160
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,092
 Shardul!
 - Yes!

161
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,093
 He wants to construct a hotel here!
 - Oh!

162
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:19,297
 Because of Mr. Seshadri
 I am tolerating him!

163
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,298
 Otherwise I would have chopped
 him into countless pieces!

164
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:24,469
 Oh no!

165
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,272
 Shardul-bhai! You will
 live a long life!

166
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,273
 I was remembering you only!

167
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,520
 Shardul! Is this the time to call?

168
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:48,057
 My mother is in the hospital!
 I am tense!

169
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,561
 Tell me! What do you want?

170
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,503
 Why do you always enter
 by the back door?

171
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,504

00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,083
 Front door.

175
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:15,084
 "Immerse in my love."

176
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,387
 "Immerse in my love."

177
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,358
 "Immerse in my love."

178
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,828
 "Immerse in my love."

179
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,167
 "Immerse in my love."

180
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,435
 "Oh yeah!"

181
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,436
 "Immerse in my love."

182
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:41,713
 "Oh yeah!"

183
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,982
 "All the sexy girls."

184
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,484
 "All the sexy boys."

185
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:49,485
 "Move! Move your body!"

186
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:52,588
 "Move! Move your body
 tonight like this!"

187
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:12,508
 50 lakhs cash in 3 days? It's
 impossible, Mr. Seshadri!

188
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,581
 Even if I try all the sources still
 I can't amass more than 10- 12 lakhs.

189
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,086
 Sir, give me one week's time.
 I will somehow arrange it.

190
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,256
 Prakash, it's important to
 fix the deal within 3 days!

191
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,726
 Otherwise Kalyan will sell
 the goods to somebody else.

192
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,097
 What about the rest?

193
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,098
 My mother is not fine. So I. . sold
 the flat on the 4th floor, sir.

194
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,304
 Last week. I thought I will
 buy the ground floor flat.

195
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:42,305
 But now. . I will buy the flat
 later. I have the money.

196
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,375
 What about you?

197
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,045
 Sir. . I invest my friends' money.

198
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,279
 So I will take a loan from them!

199
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,214
 I have no problem, sir!

200
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:53,215
 So now only you have
 a problem, Prakash.

201
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,553
 The problem can be solved.
 This place. Sell it to me.

202
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,492
 Look, Shardul! We all are
 partners of this club!

203
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,631
 And we equally share the
 profits. Don't we?

204
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,632
 But this club's property is
 mine! The land is mine!

205
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,437
 I have already cleared this!
 Sir, explain it to him!

206
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,038
 If you want to construct a hotel. .

207
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,206
 . .why don't you build
 it somewhere else?

208
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,407
 Why are you getting infuriated?
 Take out the money!

209
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,509
 Relax, man!

210
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,145
 Prakash is right! This property
 belongs to him.

211
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,146
 He can sell it or keep it. He can
 do anything. That's his wish.

212
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:28,084
 But Prakash. . if you didn't arrange
 for the money with 3 days. .

213
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:31,087
 . .then Shardul will pay the balance.

214
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,090
 And Shardul will get the
 profit too! Got it?

215
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:38,094
 "I was ignorant. Where
 have I got lost?"

216
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,630
 "I was naïve. I have become yours."

217
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,004
 "I got inflamed and doused."

218
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:55,544
 How is sister's mood?

219
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,317
 Today is my lucky day!

220
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,985
 How much have you lost?

221
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,120
 What kind of a wife are you?

222
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,188
 You show attitude in hearing
 good news too?

223
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,490
 Then say it quickly!

224
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:08,491
 Vikram has seen a place
 in Bandra. It's awesome!

225
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,594
 And Naidu. . his friend is
 ready to buy the place!

226
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,197
 You have the papers, don't you?

227
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,332
 The work will be done within a week!

228
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,601
 I don't want to buy or sell
 anything! Do anything you want!

229
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:19,237
 Varsha, at least see it once.
 The place is awesome!

230
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,205
 Had it been cards, it
 would have been 3 Aces.

231
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,307
 Varsha! Give me the papers!

232
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,308
 If you eyed my parlour. .
 I will leave you!

233
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:30,146
 Taking Chickoo with me!
 I swear! Leave!

234
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,519
 Today is 2 1st.

235
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,087
 Day after tomorrow meaning
 on the 23rd. .

236
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,022
 . .exactly at 7 o'clock. . you
 people will reach my house. .

237
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:41,023
 . . bringing your respective shares.

238
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:45,294
 23rd? Sir, it's my birthday!
 Lucky day!

239
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,034
 On the night of 23rd. .
 Shiva, you will. .

240
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:53,035
 . .go to Bangalore by
 train with the money.

241
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:56,105
 Bangalore Express leaves
 VT station at 9 : 30!

242
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:00,476
 And it will reach Bangalore the
 next day on 24th at 7 o'clock.

243
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,547
 Kalyan will meet you in the
 first class waiting room.

244
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,251
 You will hand over the
 money to Kalyan.

245
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,053
 You will collect the goods from him.

246
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,722
 And you will return to Mumbai
 by the same train.

247
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:14,058
 Meaning you will reach
 Mumbai on 25th.

248
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:17,059
 And on that day we will celebrate
 his birthday too! Fine?

249
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,330
 Yes, sir! Yeah!

250
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:22,331
 Prakash. . you will arrange
 for Shiva's ticket.

251
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:26,335
 And you will drop him and receive
 him from the station.

252
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:29,338
 Done, sir. First class coupe.

253
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:35,211
 I will check it.

254
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,485
 Sir, my wife.
 - What happened?

255
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,290
 What happened?

256
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,026
 I wanted the bank locker key.
 It's my friend's marriage. So. .

257
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:52,027
 Come!

258
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,510
 Couldn't you ask for
 it in the morning?

259
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:08,511
 Was it necessary to
 come here? Leave!

260
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,116
 Hello, Minni! How are you?

261
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:14,485
 Greetings, sir! How are you?
 - I am fine.

262
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,521
 Sorry to disturb you.
 - No, no! It's okay.

263
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,656
 How is your class going on?
 - Fine, sir!

264
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,324
 Okay! Good luck!
 - Bye.

265
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,325
 Good luck.
 - Thank you.

266
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,035
 How long have you known her?
 - Sir, who?

267
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:34,036
 Come on! You know it well!
 - Sir, I don't understand.

268
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:38,307
 Shardul's wife.

269
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,579
 Shardul is a dangerous man.
 He can do anything.

270
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:49,084
 I love her, sir!
 - She too loves you so much?

271
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,522
 Yes, sir!
 - I will pray!

272
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,046
 Hey!

273
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,119
 What happened? What did he do?

274
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,529
 I have brought all the
 jewelleries and money. .

275
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,664
 . . kept in the locker!

276
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,400
 Now I don't want to go back!

277
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,401
 Please, Vikram! Let's
 go somewhere! Anywhere!

278
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:44,006
 Please!

279
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,211
 But what happened suddenly?

280
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:50,212
 Not suddenly. It has been
 going on for years.

281
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,349
 Now I can't take it anymore.

282
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,523
 Where are you going, Vikram?
 - Let me go, Minni!

283
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,692
 Vikram! You won't
 go to meet Shardul!

284
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,227
 Nothing will happen! Just let me go!

285
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:06,097
 Don't be mad! He will kill you!
 - So what to do?

286
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,098
 Where will we go? Nagpur? Manipur?

287
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,569
 Wherever we go, he will find us.

288
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,071
 He will accuse us of robbery.

289
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:16,073
 Do you want the police to follow us?

290
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:19,074
 You don't know him!

291
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,627
 A deal is going to be fixed
 after 2 days. Of 2. 5 crores.

292
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,065
 After that we will run away!

293
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,066
 Not to Nagpur, Manipur
 but straight to Canada!

294
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,075
 A few of my college
 friends stay there.

295
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:54,076
 We get the citizenship of
 that place for 30 lakhs.

296
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:57,346
 There is snow. There is skating.

297
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:04,086
 In every 8 months there is winter.

298
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:13,228
 But if he. . reached there too?

299
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,534
 If he created a rift there then
 Niagara falls is there.

300
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:33,248
 How many zeros are there
 in 2. 5 crores?

301
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,319
 6!
 - 1, 2, 3!

302
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,058
 But we are 5 people.

303
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:44,059
 I won't get the entire sum.

304
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,505
 "What a cruel person has been made?"

305
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:02,380
 "Dance with me again!
 Can I get it right?

306
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,381
 Can I make it man?"

307
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:09,351
 "Who has cast this spell?"

308
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:12,621
 "What couldn't happen
 in so many years!"

309
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,259
 "Dance with me again!
 Can I get it right?

310
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,261
 Can I make it man?"

311
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:20,262
 "All that happened in a jiffy."

312
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:24,366
 "Rama! Rama! O Rama! Rama!"

313
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,736
 "Rama! Rama! What has happened?"

314
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:32,074
 "My state has become so weird."

315
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:35,611
 "Rama! Rama! What has happened?"

316
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:46,321
 Beautiful for whom,
 I won't leave you."

317
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:59,036
 Where are you going?

318
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:02,037
 To make a drink for you.
 - Okay.

319
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:07,211
 Hang on! Hang on!

320
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:10,212
 Hang on!

321
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:14,016
 This. .

322
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:31,233
 "I won't leave you."

323
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:38,073
 Here!

324
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,313
 Come here!

325
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,314
 Where are you going?

326
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:49,051
 Take this! Buy something
 for yourself!

327
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,488
 I don't want anything.

328
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,523
 You must want something.

329
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:55,524
 Dress, goggles, shoes, lipstick,
 nail polish. Anything.

330
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,496
 I will keep this inside. If I
 need anything I will take it.

331
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,067
 Why are you in a hurry to leave?

332
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:06,036
 Can't you sit with me for 5 minutes?

333
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,605
 I have to warm the dinner.

334
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,606
 You can even smile and say this.

335
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,210
 You are happy with me, aren't you?

336
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,513
 Of course!

337
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,514
 Of course! Then smile!
 Sit! Talk to me!

338
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,352
 Tell me about your aerobic classes.

339
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,354
 Ask me what I did the whole day!

340
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,523
 What did you do the whole day?

341
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,524
 This. . fixing Titanic pieces. .

342
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:33,595
 Lovely! Here!

343
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:37,032
 Take it!

344
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:40,502
 One more!
 - I will go and warm the dinner!

345
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,474
 Sit here!

346
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,042
 Either sit and enjoy
 the drink with me. .

347
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,111
 . .or become Rajshree
 movie's heroine.

348
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,113
 You be the virtuous wife and
 I will be the Godly husband.

349
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:52,114
 Massage my foot.

350
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,184
 What do you want to do?

351
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:57,185
 Enjoy the drink or massage my foot?

352
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,190
 Do it nicely.

353
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:03,191
 Are you giving a foot massage
 or shuffling cards?

354
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:07,329
 No matter what you do! I
 won't sell the parlour!

355
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,333
 We will not sell it. I
 will only mortgage it.

356
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,235
 That too for just a week.
 I am telling the truth.

357
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,037
 I swear on Chickoo!

358
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,038

359
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,149
 Doesn't Amitabh look so young?

360
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,585
 What do you mean?

 released before Zanjeer.

 "Don't feel shy."

364
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,531
 Naveen was the hero.

365
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,032
 Who could have thought that
 this thin, tall guy. .

366
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:45,033
 . .will someday become a superstar?

367
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:47,171
 It's all luck!

368
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:50,007
 Not just luck! It's talent too!

369
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:53,008
 And the most important
 thing is timing.

370
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:55,179
 Taking the right decision
 at the right time.

371
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,180
 He didn't let go of
 the golden chance.

372
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,119
 Today we too have a chance, Varsha.

373
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,054

00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:06,056
 We will send Chhotu to
 some nice school.

375

 And I immediately took the cab
 and went to the station.

384
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:48,296
 Railway station!

385
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,001

 Can I get chloroform?
 - You won't get it here.

391
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,222
 Why?

392
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,223
 My cat is sick. I want
 to put her to sleep.

393
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:52,027
 Julie!

394
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:56,031

 'This is your last chance.

00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:45,546
 Mother, he is Mr. Seshadri!
 You have met him!

520
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:49,252
 Okay! Okay! Greetings!

521
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:51,087
 He too is going to Kolkata!

522
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:52,422
 Mother, I am not going to Kolkata!

523
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:53,623
 I am going to Bangalore!

524
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:56,559
 Yes! That only! Take
 water bottle along!

525
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,095
 And don't put your hands
 out of the window.

526
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:02,096
 Don't eat junk food at all!
 God knows which oil they use!

527
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,366
 Medicine!

528
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:06,367
 Don't worry. You don't worry.

529
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:09,072
 Mother, I will be
 back within 2 days.

530
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,574
 But you please take your
 medicine on time. Please!

531
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,109
 Okay.
 - Okay.

532
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,511
 Do you want anything?

533
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:17,046
 Do you want anything from Bangalore?

534
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:18,381
 What do you get there?

535
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:21,382
 This lemon rice is for you.
 - Thanks.

536
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:26,189
 I will call.
 - Okay. You take care.

537
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,190
 Bye.
 - Bye.

538
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:37,534
 What's her name?

539
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:40,535
 Vaijanti.

540
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:49,078
 By the way Prakash had said
 it's off season time, sir.

541
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,480
 The train won't be so crowded.

542
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:53,481
 Don't worry.

543
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:56,517
 I will manage.
 - I know you will manage.

544
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:13,369
 Call me when you reach there. Okay.

545
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,370
 And I have packed the meals for you.

546
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:20,176
 Sir, you leave. The train
 is about to leave.

547
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:21,311
 Okay.

548
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,312
 I will call you when I will reach
 there. Good luck. - Thanks.

549
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,383
 Sorry, sir!

550
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:30,384
 Once again good luck.
 - Thanks.

551
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:33,581
 Vikram!

552
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:49,556
 Close the door!

553
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:24,058
 "Life is short but
 demands are many."

554
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:27,728
 "The rest are just talks, beloved."

555
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:38,205
 "Life is short but
 demands are many."

556
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:41,608
 "The rest are just talks, beloved."

557
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:51,585
 "Its just talks."

558
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,559
 "People say it. . and
 then forget it."

559
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:05,566
 "Hey Johnny."

560
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:09,536
 "Life is a gamble. It's a game."

561
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:13,073
 "Johnny the deceiver."

562
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:16,110
 "Today cash and then
 tomorrow credit."

563
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,513
 "Hey Johnny."

564
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:22,685
 "Self-interest is the real friend."

565
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,686
 "Hey Johnny!

566
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:53,614
 "It will not come again."

567
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:00,687
 "This life."

568
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:07,094
 "Why to lead a miserable life?"

569
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:11,098
 "Eat and drink to your
 heart's content."

570
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:14,435
 "Why to lead a miserable life?"

571
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:18,072
 "Drink to your heart's content."

572
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:20,109
 "If you will ask, its mine."

573
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:23,110
 "If you will snatch, it's yours."

574
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:55,035
 Wait.

575
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:07,009
 Hello!

576
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:10,010
 What happened, sir?

577
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,613
 What's the matter, sir?
 - Come inside.

578
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:50,484
 You called me suddenly!

579
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:01,194
 Read this.

580
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:10,472
 Our Shiva?

581
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,007
 Yes, Shiva.

582
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:14,343
 And the money?

583
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:16,512
 Somebody must have done it
 for money only, isn't it?

584
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:19,513
 Would he leave the money behind?

585
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:27,523
 But how?

586
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:29,625
 How would I know how?

587
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:32,626
 Wouldn't I wring his neck
 if I knew who has done it?

588
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:36,496
 Sir, it's written in here
 it was an accident.

589
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:39,101
 Could Shiva have fallen
 from the train, and. .

590
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:41,370
 This is not an accident;
 this is murder!

591
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:43,005
 This is definitely a murder!

592
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:46,006
 Murder? But how, sir?

593
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:48,043
 Sir, apart from the 5 of us. .

594
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:50,045
 . . nobody knew that he had
 such a big amount of money!

595
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:53,046
 That is what is worrying me.

596
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:56,049
 It surely must have slipped
 from somebody's mouth.

597
00:55:57,487 --> 00:56:00,487
 Did you mention it to
 somebody by mistake?

598
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:03,990
 No, sir.

599
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:07,062
 Sir, where are Shardul and Prakash?

600
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:08,997
 They have gone to see the dead body.

601
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:11,998
 They must have returned.

602
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:16,305
 Sir, I have sold off my property.
 Sold off shares.

603
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:18,073
 I borrowed money from
 the market, sir.

604
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:21,074
 What will I do, sir? What will I do?

605
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:23,345
 Don't talk like a child!

606
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:26,346
 My money is also involved! It
 was not just yours alone!

607
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,550
 Go, get a drink! You'll
 be all right.

608
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:59,045
 Do you suspect either
 of Shardul and Prakash?

609
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:02,317
 Why would Shardul do this?

610
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:05,053
 He already has so much money.

611
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:08,054
 And Prakash? He can't
 kill even a rat!

612
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:11,558
 Then only the two of us remain.

613
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:15,063
 Maybe somebody on the
 train found out. .

614
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:17,032
 . .that Shiva was carrying
 such a big amount.

615
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:19,501
 Maybe he stole it.

616
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:22,037
 Impossible. Impossible.

617
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:25,007
 Shiva is too strong a person.

618
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:28,008
 If somebody had tried it. .

619
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:31,077
 . .then his dead body would have
 been found in Shiva's place.

620
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:34,082
 And that police friend
 of yours? Kalyan?

621
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,518
 He too knew about this deal.

622
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:39,021
 Don't talk like an idiot!

623
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:41,023
 The money was going to be
 delivered to him only!

624
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:44,024
 Why would he need to do
 all this on the train?

625
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:51,300
 Sir, your drink?

626
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,301
 Yes, get it.

627
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:15,188
 Sir!

628
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,496
 Sir, whoever he is, will
 not escape from you.

629
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:26,466
 You can make out on seeing the face.

630
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:33,306
 What's the matter, sir?

631
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:37,210
 Even his face is not recognisable!

632
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,015
 Whose?

633
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:43,016
 Shiva's.

634
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:46,286
 It has been totally crushed!

635
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:50,290
 Vicky. . 4 years ago, I had seen
 Shiva fighting with 4 athletic men.

636
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:59,001
 He was proving to be more than
 a match for all of them.

637
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:02,002
 Nobody can kill Shiva.

638
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:05,171
 If anybody can kill Shiva,
 then it is Shiva himself.

639
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:09,311
 What do you mean?

640
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:12,047
 Vicky, it seems that Shiva
 must have found. .

641
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:15,048
 . .a man of his size and build.

642
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:19,486
 After killing him, he must have
 thrown him on the railway tracks.

643
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:23,056
 Dressing him in his clothes, he
 must have put his identity card. .

644
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,060
 . .and all the contents of his
 pockets into his pockets.

645
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:32,532
 And he must have run
 away with the money.

646
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:37,037
 Sir, but why would Shiva do that?

647
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,074
 His mother is in hospital.

648
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:42,075
 Sir, he can't leave her and go.

649
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:53,021
 Where are the two of you? I
 have been waiting since long!

650
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:56,022
 Yes, come fast.

651
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:58,093
 Sir, Shiva's mother is in hospital.

652
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,596
 He cannot leave her and go.

653
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,597
 In the hospital there is his
 girlfriend Vaijanti also.

654
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:09,071
 It is possible that she might
 have helped him in this.

655
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:11,540
 Sir, but I don't think
 Shiva can do this.

656
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,575
 I mean I had met him 3 days ago.

657
01:00:13,576 --> 01:00:15,110
 He is going to open
 a garage at Charkop. .

658
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,244
 He had shown me the place also.

659
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:18,113
 Stop talking nonsense!

660
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,247
 Go to the hospital immediately.

661
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:20,549
 Keep a watch over there.

662
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:23,118
 Vaijanti might slip out with mother.

663
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,420
 Sir, I am going. But I
 don't believe it, sir.

664
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:27,456
 That day you had gone to
 drop him at the station.

665
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,590
 Did you suspect from his talk. .

666
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:31,591
 . .that he will do something
 like this with us?

667
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:35,128
 I didn't feel anything different.
 - Ok.

668
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:38,131
 But he sneezed when he was
 entering the compartment.

669
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:41,036
 My wife used to say that
 if somebody sneezes. .

670
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:43,038
 . .when you set out for some work. .

671
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:46,039
 . .then that work cannot
 be accomplished.

672
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:49,576
 I don't believe in these things, but
 our task did remain unaccomplished.

673
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:00,220
 Don't worry; I won't leave him.

674
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:03,356
 I won't spare him.

675
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:26,613
 Vicky, who told you that I had gone
 to the station to drop Shiva?

676
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:34,656
 Sir you only had told me.

677
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:37,657
 No; I did not tell you.

678
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:40,262
 Sir, you only told me. .

679
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:41,530
 . .otherwise how would I have known?

680
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,065
 Yesterday, when I talked
 to you on the phone. .

681
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:45,333
 . .even then I had not told you.

682
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:48,334
 Today you are with me. I
 have never mentioned it.

683
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:51,406
 Sir, you are forgetting,
 you only told me.

684
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:52,541
 Sir, I will make a drink.

685
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,077
 Vicky, sit down. Sit down.

686
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:58,078
 We will have a drink also.

687
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:01,581
 It was decided that Prakash will
 go to drop him at the station.

688
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:05,085
 He could not go, so I had
 to go all of a sudden.

689
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:09,089
 How did you find out that
 I had gone to the station?

690
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,094
 Sir, you only told me.

691
01:02:12,095 --> 01:02:14,096
 Otherwise how would I have known?

692
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:17,097
 You have seen me at the station.

693
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:19,267
 Sir, you have a misconception.

694
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:21,069
 Sir I was not there.

695
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,071
 Did you send somebody
 to murder him. .

696
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:25,474
 . .or did you go personally?

697
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:28,443
 What are you saying, sir?
 You are suspecting me!

698
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:31,179
 Sir, I was not there.
 - Shut up, you scoundrel!!

699
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,048
 Tell me! Tell me the truth!

700
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:36,049
 Come on!

701
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:39,119
 It was an accident, sir!

702
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:42,057
 Sir, I tried to make
 him unconscious.

703
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:45,058
 He began to beat me.

704
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:47,395
 I pushed him. He fell down.

705
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:50,396
 His head crashed into
 the basin and he died.

706
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:54,035
 Sir, I thought, if I get the money. .

707
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:57,036
 . .I will take Minni and go away.

708
01:02:57,073 --> 01:02:59,441
 Sir, I don't want anything.
 I don't want anything.

709
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:02,344
 Please help me!

710
01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:05,345
 Please help me, sir!

711
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:09,082
 You have gone on a
 dark path, my son.

712
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:11,086
 Sir, I made a mistake.

713
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:13,155
 Please sir, I am really sorry.

714
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:16,156
 Let Prakash and Shardul come.

715
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:19,094
 Then we will think about what
 happens and what to do.

716
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:21,363
 You have done what you wanted to do.

717
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:23,431
 Sir please, I'm sorry! Sir, please!

718
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:26,432
 Please forgive me, sir!

719
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:35,241
 I had timed it with chloroform.

720
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:38,378
 I was unconscious for 1 1/2 hours.

721
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:41,381
 I had thought. . I had thought
 that Shiva also will. .

722
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:57,197
 Sir. . I haven't spent the money.

723
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,404
 Sir, it's the full amount.

724
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:05,340
 The money is in the car.

725
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:08,341
 Sir, the car is parked
 at the multiplex.

726
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:15,582
 'I suggest we tie him on the same
 track and leave him there. '

727
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:20,086
 'In a few moments, he would
 be cut into pieces. '

728
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:56,482
 "Where should I go? I don't know."

729
01:05:56,752 --> 01:05:59,752
 "Somebody tell me."

730
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:05,525
 "Take my fair complexion."

731
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:09,062
 "Give me dark complexion."

732
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:13,066
 "I will hide in the twilight."

733
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:16,302
 "Give me my beloved's company."

734
01:06:18,507 --> 01:06:21,476
 "The moon peeps from the cloud."

735
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:24,477
 "May you be eclipsed."

736
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:29,082
 "It smiles making me feel envious."

737
01:06:35,091 --> 01:06:38,091
 "Take my fair complexion."

738
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:41,494
 "Give me dark complexion."

739
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:45,298
 "I will hide in the twilight."

740
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:49,102
 "Give me my beloved's company."

741
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:53,006
 "Coyness pulls one hand."

742
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:55,543
 "Love the other."

743
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:58,544
 'Pick up the phone, Seshu!'

744
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:09,991
 'Hey, stop!'

745
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:12,992
 'Come here!'

746
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:16,331
 'Come! Come here!'

747
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:19,234
 'Enough, Seshu! Dr. No is
 running at the Regal.'

748
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:20,335
 'Weren't you going to
 take me to watch it?'

749
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:21,503
 'Come on get up!'

750
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:22,604
 'Dr. Yes is sitting in your house.'

751
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:25,073
 'Do you want to leave
 him and go to Regal?'

752
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:28,074
 'Silly!'

753
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,861
 What happened? Why are you
 guys standing outside?

754
01:08:58,862 --> 01:09:00,263
 Where is Mr. Seshadri?

755
01:09:00,264 --> 01:09:01,831
 From where are you coming?

756
01:09:01,832 --> 01:09:04,400
 Goa! Yesterday he had called.

757
01:09:04,401 --> 01:09:06,602
 He was saying there is some problem.

758
01:09:06,603 --> 01:09:09,603
 He called me back quickly.
 What happened?

759
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:12,475
 Shiva is dead!
 - What?

760
01:09:12,476 --> 01:09:15,476
 And our money too has vanished!

761
01:09:18,448 --> 01:09:20,283
 Sir! What happened, sir?

762
01:09:20,284 --> 01:09:23,284
 Sir!

763
01:09:23,287 --> 01:09:26,287
 What are you looking?

764
01:09:34,498 --> 01:09:36,632
 Sir!
 - Sir!

765
01:09:36,633 --> 01:09:39,633
 Sir!

766
01:09:40,570 --> 01:09:41,704
 Sir!
 - Mr. Seshadri!

767
01:09:41,705 --> 01:09:44,705
 Sir!

768
01:10:05,662 --> 01:10:07,330
 Hello.

769
01:10:07,331 --> 01:10:09,532
 Kalyan!

770
01:10:09,533 --> 01:10:12,533
 Yes! Mr. Kalyan! This
 is Shardul speaking.

771
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:16,605
 Yes! He is here!
 - Say later!

772
01:10:16,606 --> 01:10:18,808
 I will call you after 10 minutes.

773
01:10:18,809 --> 01:10:21,809
 Yes. . I will call you within
 10 minutes. Yes! Okay!

774
01:10:30,454 --> 01:10:33,454
 At 4:40 Mr. Seshadri had
 called from this number.

775
01:10:34,291 --> 01:10:35,891
 And at around 5 o'clock
 we were pushing the door.

776
01:10:35,892 --> 01:10:38,861
 Let's call the police! Are
 you mad?

777
01:10:38,862 --> 01:10:41,862
 Let's call the police!

778
01:10:42,432 --> 01:10:43,566
 Shardul!

779
01:11:18,231 --> 01:11:20,668
Sir. . whoever has killed you. .
we won't spare him.

780
01:11:54,674 --> 01:11:57,143
Mr. Seshadri's watch. It's working.

781
01:12:00,715 --> 01:12:03,183
You keep it. He respected you a lot.

782
01:12:22,386 --> 01:12:24,271
You keep it. He respected you a lot.

783
01:12:29,683 --> 01:12:30,962
"Escaping! Escaping! Escaping!
Escaping!". .

784
01:12:30,963 --> 01:12:32,472
. ."Escaping! Escaping!
Escaping! Escaping!"

785
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:34,359
"Where will you escape?"

786
01:12:35,052 --> 01:12:36,938
"Where will you escape?"

787
01:12:37,694 --> 01:12:39,580
"From these eyes, these charms."

788
01:12:40,044 --> 01:12:41,928
"Where will you escape?"

789
01:12:42,601 --> 01:12:44,487
"Where will you escape?"

790
01:12:45,202 --> 01:12:47,088
"Where will you escape?"

791
01:12:47,719 --> 01:12:49,605
"Where will you escape?"

792
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:52,226
"From these eyes, these charms."

793
01:12:52,773 --> 01:12:54,659
"Where will you escape?"

794
01:12:55,311 --> 01:12:57,196
"Where will you escape?"

795
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:01,507
Do you know what kind of work we do?

796
01:13:01,508 --> 01:13:04,530
Yes, sir! A bit.
- Still you want to join us?

797
01:13:11,621 --> 01:13:14,643
Have a seat.

798
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:20,220
The beginning is always
with helplessness.

799
01:13:22,071 --> 01:13:25,093
Helplessness gradually becomes need.

800
01:13:26,506 --> 01:13:29,358
And then need becomes habit.

801
01:13:30,503 --> 01:13:33,355
You are an educated guy.
You are young.

802
01:13:34,436 --> 01:13:36,022
Why don't you do some
other kind of work?

803
01:13:36,023 --> 01:13:38,875
I want to work with you, sir!
- Quick money.

804
01:13:39,925 --> 01:13:42,777
You want to become rich fast!

805
01:13:43,699 --> 01:13:46,699
Fine, dear. If this is what you
are destined for. . then welcome.

806
01:13:48,571 --> 01:13:51,106
Thank you, sir! Lovely watch, sir!

807
01:13:51,107 --> 01:13:54,107
It must be very expensive!

808
01:13:54,911 --> 01:13:57,911
My wife had presented me this watch.

809
01:14:01,517 --> 01:14:04,517
'72! I used to smuggle watches.

810
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:09,591
And my wife saved money
from her salary. .

811
01:14:09,592 --> 01:14:12,592
. .and got this watch for me.

812
01:14:14,163 --> 01:14:17,065
Now till the time this
watch is with me. .

813
01:14:17,066 --> 01:14:20,066
. .I feel she too is near me.

814
01:15:36,812 --> 01:15:39,812
The person who killed Seshadri. .
he is in this room.

815
01:15:42,952 --> 01:15:45,952
You! You! You!

816
01:15:50,493 --> 01:15:53,094
Or me!

817
01:15:53,095 --> 01:15:56,095
Why not?

818
01:15:57,133 --> 01:16:00,133
Besides you people only
I knew that Shiva. .

819
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:04,070
. . is coming by train
carrying 2.5 crores.

820
01:16:12,748 --> 01:16:15,748
2 days. Only 2 days.

821
01:16:19,789 --> 01:16:22,789
Within 2 days I will find
out the murderer.

822
01:16:24,193 --> 01:16:27,193
Till then you guys behave normally.

823
01:16:27,563 --> 01:16:29,164
As if nothing has happened.

824
01:16:29,165 --> 01:16:32,165
Otherwise. . suspicion will arise.

825
01:16:33,803 --> 01:16:36,803
Seshadri was my friend.

826
01:16:42,478 --> 01:16:44,479
Only 2 days.

827
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:47,480
Within 2 days I will find out
everything about this Kalyan!

828
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:50,151
It's possible that
he stole the money.

829
01:16:50,152 --> 01:16:51,886
Then why would he come here?

830
01:16:51,887 --> 01:16:54,887
Buddy. . - He too must be in
a hurry to sell his goods.

831
01:16:55,091 --> 01:16:57,625
Your friend had arranged
for the ticket! - So?

832
01:16:57,626 --> 01:16:59,894
Did you tell him anything?

833
01:16:59,895 --> 01:17:02,730
Shardul! What is written here? Fool!

834
01:17:02,731 --> 01:17:05,600
Here is the list of the
train! 41 passengers!

835
01:17:05,601 --> 01:17:08,503
It will take 10- 15 days to find out!

836
01:17:08,504 --> 01:17:10,572
I have taken a loan of 35 lakhs.

837
01:17:10,573 --> 01:17:13,573
If I didn't get it back within 4
days, then I will be in trouble.

838
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:18,010
Bring ice!

839
01:17:22,852 --> 01:17:25,852
Your. . Twinkle.

840
01:17:26,522 --> 01:17:29,190
Hello, Twinkle!
- Hello.

841
01:17:29,191 --> 01:17:32,191
Twinkle. . I will be there
by 2 o'clock. Sure.

842
01:17:35,931 --> 01:17:38,133
Your girlfriend?

843
01:17:38,134 --> 01:17:39,567
She is my landlord's daughter.

844
01:17:39,568 --> 01:17:42,568
Daughters are girlfriend. Who else. .

845
01:17:42,872 --> 01:17:45,006
Vikram, its 2:30! Where are you?

846
01:17:45,007 --> 01:17:48,007
Which signal?

847
01:17:58,687 --> 01:18:01,687
Hello!

848
01:18:08,097 --> 01:18:10,665
Hi! Sorry!

849
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:12,934
Hello, sir! Interesting pussy cat!

850
01:18:12,935 --> 01:18:15,935
Hi! Hi! - Isn't it?

851
01:18:16,038 --> 01:18:19,038
Mr. Kalyan thought that
I am your wife.

852
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:22,041
I told him. That this is
my papa's house. Papa. .

853
01:18:22,111 --> 01:18:24,145
Your papa had called.

854
01:18:24,146 --> 01:18:26,915
Bedroom key is missing. He was
going to send the key maker.

855
01:18:26,916 --> 01:18:28,816
I am waiting for him only.

856
01:18:28,817 --> 01:18:31,817
I was famished. So I
raided your fridge.

857
01:18:31,854 --> 01:18:33,655
I hope you don't mind.
- No, no! Not at all!

858
01:18:33,656 --> 01:18:34,789
By the way I am cooking. .

859
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:35,924
. .stirred fried vegetable
and tomato soup.

860
01:18:35,925 --> 01:18:38,660
Did you have lunch?
- No. Sounds good.

861
01:18:38,661 --> 01:18:41,661
Sir, why don't you join us?
- Why not, sir?

862
01:18:42,665 --> 01:18:45,665
I am pure. . non-vegetarian.

863
01:18:47,670 --> 01:18:50,670
Okay! Excuse me!

864
01:19:03,018 --> 01:19:06,018
Sorry for intruding!

865
01:19:07,890 --> 01:19:10,890
No, sir! This is not the case!
Julie! Julie! Come!

866
01:19:14,096 --> 01:19:17,096
Found out anything?

867
01:19:20,569 --> 01:19:23,569
How was Goa?
- Sorry!

868
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,709
You had too much fun!
- I had gone there for work.

869
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:29,644
Your lawyer Gomes told me that. .

870
01:19:29,645 --> 01:19:32,580
. .you spend the entire night
with a foreigner girl.

871
01:19:32,581 --> 01:19:35,581
Frenka! My friend! She was
in Goa. So I met her.

872
01:19:38,053 --> 01:19:39,988
I don't know about Shardul
and Prakash!

873
01:19:39,989 --> 01:19:42,989
But Seshadri did tell me about you.

874
01:19:43,525 --> 01:19:46,525
He said. . very smart boy.

875
01:19:52,768 --> 01:19:55,768
Whom do you doubt?

876
01:19:55,871 --> 01:19:58,871
Not both of them! I don't know
who killed Mr. Seshadri!

877
01:20:01,176 --> 01:20:04,176
But Shiva. . did you know Shiva?

878
01:20:05,948 --> 01:20:08,016
He was tough.

879
01:20:08,017 --> 01:20:11,017
And somebody killed him and
threw him from the train.

880
01:20:11,687 --> 01:20:13,955
Impossible!

881
01:20:13,956 --> 01:20:16,956
Only one man can kill Shiva!
Shiva himself.

882
01:20:33,042 --> 01:20:34,208
Bye-bye!

883
01:20:34,209 --> 01:20:36,844
You didn't eat anything.
Taste something.

884
01:20:36,845 --> 01:20:39,845
Not right now. But we
will meet soon. Bye.

885
01:20:42,785 --> 01:20:45,785
What was that hospital's name?

886
01:20:59,768 --> 01:21:02,768
What happened, Vikram? Who was he?

887
01:21:02,805 --> 01:21:05,805
A police officer. Somebody has
killed Mr. Seshadri and Shiva.

888
01:21:09,545 --> 01:21:12,545
And our money is missing!

889
01:21:12,548 --> 01:21:15,548
Now what about us?
What about Canada?

890
01:21:16,552 --> 01:21:18,553
We will go, Minni.

891
01:21:18,554 --> 01:21:21,554
But if I went anywhere right now. .
then they will doubt me.

892
01:21:29,565 --> 01:21:32,565
Whoever has killed Mr. Seshadri. .
he will die a brutal death!

893
01:21:39,575 --> 01:21:42,575
Greetings, aunt!

894
01:21:48,984 --> 01:21:51,984
Okay!

895
01:21:52,087 --> 01:21:55,087
I am Shiva's friend Kalyan!
From Bangalore.

896
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:58,192
How are you? Shiva has
asked to inquire.

897
01:21:58,193 --> 01:21:59,527
Where is Shiva?

898
01:21:59,528 --> 01:22:01,929
He had called. He is
in Kolkata, isn't he?

899
01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:03,030
You keep quiet! Have your medicine.

900
01:22:03,031 --> 01:22:06,031
Kolkata!
- Right now! - Yes I can understand!

901
01:22:10,139 --> 01:22:13,139
Sir. . Shiva didn't call.

902
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:16,611
Aunt talks nonsense.

903
01:22:16,612 --> 01:22:19,612
He had gone to Kolkata last year.
She is telling you about that.

904
01:22:19,948 --> 01:22:21,816
Alzheimer is in advanced stage.

905
01:22:21,817 --> 01:22:24,018
What Amitabh Bachchan suffered
from in the movie Black. .

906
01:22:24,019 --> 01:22:26,220
. .that same ailment.

907
01:22:26,221 --> 01:22:27,822
Did you talk to Shiva?

908
01:22:27,823 --> 01:22:30,823
Can't you hear this bell?
- Aunt, relax!

909
01:22:31,126 --> 01:22:34,126
Get the coconut water for me.
- I will just get it.

910
01:22:34,563 --> 01:22:36,264
Bring the straw along too.
- Yes. I will get it.

911
01:22:36,265 --> 01:22:39,265
You always forget.

912
01:22:43,172 --> 01:22:46,172
What name did you say of the hotel?

913
01:22:46,508 --> 01:22:47,975
Shiva had told you, didn't he?

914
01:22:47,976 --> 01:22:50,111
He had called from Kolkata.

915
01:22:50,112 --> 01:22:53,112
He doesn't talk for long with me.
He spoke just for 2 minutes.

916
01:22:53,115 --> 01:22:56,115
He talks a lot with her.
- I see! I see!

917
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:01,120
Will you eat sweet lemon?
- No.

918
01:23:02,524 --> 01:23:05,092
Will you peel the skin?
- What?

919
01:23:05,093 --> 01:23:07,929
The skin!

920
01:23:07,930 --> 01:23:10,930
. .Yes. Of the sweet lemon?
- Yes.

921
01:23:16,538 --> 01:23:19,538
Sweet lemon juice is very good
for the patient. Right?

922
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:22,541
Vaijanti! Do you speak Tamil?

923
01:23:23,779 --> 01:23:25,880
Where is Shiva, he has not been
seen for the last two days?

924
01:23:25,881 --> 01:23:28,881
Where is he?

925
01:23:32,221 --> 01:23:35,221
Shiva has returned.

926
01:23:36,024 --> 01:23:39,024
But he can't contact openly.
So he has sent me.

927
01:23:41,897 --> 01:23:44,897
To bring you along. Come on.

928
01:23:57,779 --> 01:24:00,779
Where is Shiva? Nobody is here!

929
01:24:15,764 --> 01:24:18,764
Shiva is in Kolkata?
Or somewhere else?

930
01:24:20,536 --> 01:24:23,536
Please!

931
01:24:23,805 --> 01:24:25,940
The old lady told me everything.
He calls you.

932
01:24:25,941 --> 01:24:28,876
I don't know where Shiva is!

933
01:24:28,877 --> 01:24:31,877
What does he say? From
where does he call?

934
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:34,880
No! No!

935
01:24:57,072 --> 01:25:00,072
Hello, sir!
- Hi, Vikram! Come! Come!

936
01:25:02,778 --> 01:25:05,778
Vaijanti! What have you done?

937
01:25:09,851 --> 01:25:12,851
She is not dead. She is
just unconscious. Look.

938
01:25:18,193 --> 01:25:21,193
Shiva's girlfriend!

939
01:25:23,532 --> 01:25:26,532
She is tougher than Shiva.

940
01:25:26,935 --> 01:25:28,703
Shiva must not have told
her anything, sir.

941
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:31,105
She knows everything.

942
01:25:31,106 --> 01:25:34,106
Working in the hospital, she has
learned how to endure pain.

943
01:25:35,143 --> 01:25:38,143
Otherwise she would have
spilled out by now.

944
01:25:39,548 --> 01:25:42,548
Let her regain consciousness.
We will find out everything.

945
01:25:43,986 --> 01:25:45,753
I am still trying.

946
01:25:45,754 --> 01:25:48,754
But sir, you. . - She will reveal
everything. Trust me!

947
01:25:50,892 --> 01:25:53,127
I trusted you. This was
my biggest mistake.

948
01:25:53,128 --> 01:25:54,929
You lured me! You mortgaged
my parlour!

949
01:25:54,930 --> 01:25:56,097
You have put me into trouble!

950
01:25:56,098 --> 01:25:57,198
What are saying?

951
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:59,734
Goons come here, Prakash.
They stare at my clients.

952
01:25:59,735 --> 01:26:02,503
They threaten me! Because of
you my parlour is ruined.

953
01:26:02,504 --> 01:26:03,838
I promise. I will make
everything fine.

954
01:26:03,839 --> 01:26:06,839
First reform yourself!
Then talk to me!

955
01:26:07,509 --> 01:26:09,510
Yeah! Yeah! Of course!
I am coming there!

956
01:26:09,511 --> 01:26:12,511
Light the candles!

957
01:26:14,082 --> 01:26:17,082
Mr. Kalyan! You only had
said to behave normally!

958
01:26:17,919 --> 01:26:20,919
Today is my wedding anniversary!
Thank you!

959
01:26:20,989 --> 01:26:23,989
I am giving a party in the evening
at Royal Palm at 8 o'clock.

960
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:25,793
See you, sir!

961
01:26:25,794 --> 01:26:26,961
Good news!

962
01:26:26,962 --> 01:26:29,163
Everything will be
fine within 2 days.

963
01:26:29,164 --> 01:26:30,564
I will lay down my life
but I won't let. .

964
01:26:30,565 --> 01:26:33,565
. .anything happen to your parlour!

965
01:26:33,935 --> 01:26:36,003
You are so filmy, aren't you?

966
01:26:36,004 --> 01:26:39,004
Let's go for dinner.

967
01:26:46,715 --> 01:26:49,715
"Life is a co-incidence."

968
01:26:54,756 --> 01:26:57,756
"Life is a co-incidence."

969
01:26:57,926 --> 01:27:00,494
Look, Mr. Kalyan! Its simple logic!

970
01:27:00,495 --> 01:27:03,495
If your house is on fire. . then
first extinguish the fire.

971
01:27:03,932 --> 01:27:06,932
And then try to find out who
set the fire. Am I right?

972
01:27:07,769 --> 01:27:10,571
Mr. Kalyan, we both
have taken a loan.

973
01:27:10,572 --> 01:27:13,572
I say first hand over
the goods to us.

974
01:27:13,909 --> 01:27:16,177
We will sell it within 2 days.

975
01:27:16,178 --> 01:27:18,179
You will get your 2.5 crores.

976
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:21,180
And at least we will get
our investment back.

977
01:27:22,784 --> 01:27:25,784
Am I right, Vikram?

978
01:27:26,121 --> 01:27:29,121
Who will get what share. .
only time will reveal that.

979
01:27:30,092 --> 01:27:32,793
Look, son. Don't harass aunt.

980
01:27:32,794 --> 01:27:35,794
Go to sleep quickly. No, son.
Mama loves you, my baby!

981
01:27:37,165 --> 01:27:39,800
Hang on! Talk to papa!

982
01:27:39,801 --> 01:27:42,737
Chikoo dear good night.
- Sorry! It's my son! . .

983
01:27:42,738 --> 01:27:45,738
Do you have children?
- No! I have an allergy.

984
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:51,810
I didn't get married.
Only duty, no beauty.

985
01:27:57,619 --> 01:28:00,619
Shardul has come.

986
01:28:09,798 --> 01:28:12,798
"Beauty and youth is there."

987
01:28:13,635 --> 01:28:16,635
"Life is successful."

988
01:28:17,706 --> 01:28:19,907
Shardul. - Yes. Shall I
tell chopstick for you?

989
01:28:19,908 --> 01:28:22,810
I can't eat with chopstick.
It doesn't suit me.

990
01:28:22,811 --> 01:28:25,646
My menu is fixed! One beer and
one plate of smashed potatoes.

991
01:28:25,647 --> 01:28:28,249
Mashed potatoes!
- Yes!

992
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:31,250
Oyster soup for me! Get it quickly
we are hungry, friend.

993
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:36,857
You please order.

994
01:28:36,858 --> 01:28:39,858
One tomato soup. One stirred
fried vegetables.

995
01:28:43,031 --> 01:28:46,031
What will you have, Mrs. Shardul?

996
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:00,614
You order for me. Excuse me. .

997
01:29:00,615 --> 01:29:03,615
. ."All this is a co-incidence."

998
01:29:06,021 --> 01:29:09,021
Vikram!

999
01:29:09,558 --> 01:29:12,558
Thank you!

1000
01:29:22,637 --> 01:29:25,637
What do I tell you?
- Everything!

1001
01:29:25,707 --> 01:29:28,142
You'll pay the bill?

1002
01:29:28,143 --> 01:29:30,644
We have come here to please him
we will split the bill.

1003
01:29:30,645 --> 01:29:32,646
Your sitting on the property
like a guardian snake. .

1004
01:29:32,647 --> 01:29:34,582
. .and you'll share the bill?

1005
01:29:34,583 --> 01:29:35,816
Don't talk about the property?
- Okay then pay the bill!

1006
01:29:35,817 --> 01:29:37,051
Okay I'll pay it.

1007
01:29:37,052 --> 01:29:38,919
He'll pay it.

1008
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:41,722
"She rules over your heart."

1009
01:29:41,723 --> 01:29:44,723
It's enough!

1010
01:29:46,194 --> 01:29:49,194
Mr. Kalyan! How far has your
investigation proceeded?

1011
01:29:50,966 --> 01:29:53,966
I had said 2 days, Mr. Shardul!
- Okay!

1012
01:29:56,605 --> 01:29:59,605
Let us enjoy the beer. Cheers.

1013
01:30:00,542 --> 01:30:02,543
Cheers!
- Cheers!

1014
01:30:02,544 --> 01:30:04,545
Thank you very much, sir!

1015
01:30:04,546 --> 01:30:07,114
Actually Minni and I love
each other a lot, sir!

1016
01:30:07,115 --> 01:30:10,115
Forget it! It is not my business!

1017
01:30:14,122 --> 01:30:17,122
Once upon a time. . I too was young.

1018
01:30:20,962 --> 01:30:22,563
Don't worry.

1019
01:30:22,564 --> 01:30:25,564
Fine. Let's change the topic.

1020
01:30:28,637 --> 01:30:31,637
Who is your favourite actor?
- Amitabh Bachchan!

1021
01:30:35,577 --> 01:30:36,844
You have watched all of his movies?

1022
01:30:36,845 --> 01:30:38,178
Of course, sir!

1023
01:30:38,179 --> 01:30:40,781
Zanjeer! Sholay! Deewar! Don!

1024
01:30:40,782 --> 01:30:43,782
Amar Akbar Anthony! Satte Pe Satta!

1025
01:30:44,085 --> 01:30:47,085
Parwana!

1026
01:30:47,522 --> 01:30:50,522
No, sir. I didn't watch that movie.

1027
01:30:51,526 --> 01:30:54,526
Shall I tell you the story?

1028
01:30:57,165 --> 01:31:00,165
At the Goa airport, the security
in-charge recognised your photo!

1029
01:31:02,103 --> 01:31:04,805
Unnecessarily you
worried me so much!

1030
01:31:04,806 --> 01:31:07,806
Seshadri was my friend!

1031
01:31:07,809 --> 01:31:10,809
He considered you as his son.
Where is the bag?

1032
01:31:11,112 --> 01:31:14,112
In my house! In the water tank!

1033
01:31:15,216 --> 01:31:18,216
Shardul! The case is solved.

1034
01:31:18,553 --> 01:31:20,955
Let's meet within 1 hour.
Hello, Prakash.

1035
01:31:20,956 --> 01:31:22,790
Let's meet at Shardul's
office within an hour.

1036
01:31:22,791 --> 01:31:25,791
The case is solved!

1037
01:31:43,078 --> 01:31:46,078
Vaijanti!

1038
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:15,540
Vikram! Vikram!

1039
01:32:16,544 --> 01:32:19,544
Where is Kalyan? - Upstairs!
I hit him with the stone!

1040
01:32:42,837 --> 01:32:45,837
Answer it! Answer it!

1041
01:32:46,074 --> 01:32:48,175
It's just ringing! He
is not answering it!

1042
01:32:48,176 --> 01:32:51,176
I don't know where he
is! 'Your message. '

1043
01:32:52,914 --> 01:32:54,081
Kalyan.

1044
01:32:54,082 --> 01:32:55,749
What is he saying?

1045
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:58,750
3 donkeys were waiting
at the river bed.

1046
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:01,920
And they found out that the
laundryman has bought the cycle.

1047
01:33:02,123 --> 01:33:03,857
What does this mean?

1048
01:33:03,858 --> 01:33:06,858
What can it mean? It means
the laundryman. .

1049
01:33:07,062 --> 01:33:09,129
Hang on!

1050
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:11,565
Kalyan!

1051
01:33:11,566 --> 01:33:14,535
3 donkeys were waiting
at the river bed.

1052
01:33:14,536 --> 01:33:17,536
Joker!

1053
01:33:18,206 --> 01:33:19,807
What happened?

1054
01:33:19,808 --> 01:33:22,808
Minor accident. It could have
been major. I survived.

1055
01:33:25,113 --> 01:33:26,613
Where is Kalyan? Since when. .

1056
01:33:26,614 --> 01:33:27,981
. .we have been waiting for Kalyan!

1057
01:33:27,982 --> 01:33:29,116
You too wait for him.

1058
01:33:29,117 --> 01:33:31,618
He had called. He said the case
is solved. To meet here.

1059
01:33:31,619 --> 01:33:34,619
And now he messaged me. I
can't understand anything.

1060
01:33:34,956 --> 01:33:37,956
3 donkeys. .

1061
01:33:40,095 --> 01:33:43,095
If he had to say anything, he
would have said it last night.

1062
01:33:44,032 --> 01:33:47,032
You don't worry about Kalyan,
Minni! Please!

1063
01:33:47,102 --> 01:33:49,503
He has left Mumbai!

1064
01:33:49,504 --> 01:33:51,839
He has left Mumbai! Tomorrow
somebody else will come!

1065
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:54,074
Then what?

1066
01:33:54,075 --> 01:33:55,742
Here everything is going wrong.

1067
01:33:55,743 --> 01:33:58,512
I can't understand anything.
I am really scared, Vikram!

1068
01:33:58,513 --> 01:34:00,114
Please let's go somewhere.
Today itself.

1069
01:34:00,115 --> 01:34:02,783
I can't!
- Please. .

1070
01:34:02,784 --> 01:34:05,784
If I left suddenly,
they will doubt me.

1071
01:34:07,122 --> 01:34:10,122
Did you steal? Did you
kill your partners?

1072
01:34:11,526 --> 01:34:12,659
Are you mad?

1073
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:15,660
Then why are you scared?

1074
01:34:15,864 --> 01:34:17,564
Minni, I understand your problem.

1075
01:34:17,565 --> 01:34:19,533
You don't understand my problem.

1076
01:34:19,534 --> 01:34:21,535
My husband wants a child.

1077
01:34:21,536 --> 01:34:24,536
Now you tell me. What excuse
should I make everyday?

1078
01:34:32,547 --> 01:34:35,547
"Fate changes in a jiffy."

1079
01:34:36,618 --> 01:34:39,618
"The one who plays and take
the risk, he wins."

1080
01:34:40,755 --> 01:34:43,755
Wow! "Come, sir! Why are you afraid?"

1081
01:34:44,959 --> 01:34:47,959
"The hands of time are moving on."

1082
01:34:57,772 --> 01:35:00,772
Come!

1083
01:35:01,109 --> 01:35:03,076
Where is Prakash?

1084
01:35:03,077 --> 01:35:06,077
Prakash-bhai is upstairs!

1085
01:35:07,081 --> 01:35:09,850
Wow! Wow! Wow!

1086
01:35:09,851 --> 01:35:12,851
Once more! Once more! Once more!

1087
01:35:17,592 --> 01:35:20,160
Great! Mr. Naidu!

1088
01:35:20,161 --> 01:35:21,762
A wealthy party!

1089
01:35:21,763 --> 01:35:24,531
Last Diwali he lost
22 lakhs at one go.

1090
01:35:24,532 --> 01:35:26,033
Come, Parekh-bhai! Prakash-bhai!

1091
01:35:26,034 --> 01:35:28,936
Parekh-bhai, how are you?
I had heard this is a posh club!

1092
01:35:28,937 --> 01:35:31,805
But why are you playing
20-50 points downstairs?

1093
01:35:31,806 --> 01:35:34,608
Tell me about some big game!

1094
01:35:34,609 --> 01:35:37,609
You want to play a big game?
I will just show you! Come!

1095
01:35:48,556 --> 01:35:51,556
Parekh-bhai!

1096
01:35:52,894 --> 01:35:55,894
Pick one.

1097
01:36:14,182 --> 01:36:17,182
Pick one.

1098
01:36:22,523 --> 01:36:23,890
Sir, already we have
lost too much money!

1099
01:36:23,891 --> 01:36:25,792
I will get it. . within 5 minutes.

1100
01:36:25,793 --> 01:36:27,060
They too are playing. I
will have to give! . .

1101
01:36:27,061 --> 01:36:28,562
. . Fine! I will return
it! I am there!

1102
01:36:28,563 --> 01:36:31,563
I want it back! What is this!

1103
01:36:43,745 --> 01:36:46,146
What?

1104
01:36:46,147 --> 01:36:49,147
He lost 10 lakhs!

1105
01:36:49,217 --> 01:36:52,217
No!

1106
01:36:57,892 --> 01:36:59,626
Let's have a drink!
What will you have?

1107
01:36:59,627 --> 01:37:02,496
Forget it! What to drink!

1108
01:37:02,497 --> 01:37:05,497
I have told them! I
won't give a penny!

1109
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:07,834
Because of you we have incurred
a loss! So you only pay it!

1110
01:37:07,835 --> 01:37:09,569
Who told you to pay it?

1111
01:37:09,570 --> 01:37:11,571
Profit and loss happens in business!

1112
01:37:11,572 --> 01:37:12,839
Pay it for this month!

1113
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:14,574
Next month I will settle
the account.

1114
01:37:14,575 --> 01:37:17,575
I won't pay a single penny!
I won't pay a single penny!

1115
01:37:17,812 --> 01:37:20,812
Go and tell Naidu! He won't
get any money here!

1116
01:37:21,082 --> 01:37:22,683
Shardul-bhai, the club's
honour is at stake!

1117
01:37:22,684 --> 01:37:24,584
We will have to pay it! To
hell with the club. .

1118
01:37:24,585 --> 01:37:25,852
. .and to hell with the honour!

1119
01:37:25,853 --> 01:37:28,853
Close this place!

1120
01:37:28,990 --> 01:37:31,858
If there is a loss, then
we make profit too!

1121
01:37:31,859 --> 01:37:34,859
Is that so? You will
reap the benefit!

1122
01:37:35,129 --> 01:37:37,764
If there is a loss,
then Shardul-bhai!

1123
01:37:37,765 --> 01:37:40,765
What are you trying to say?
- Don't touch me!

1124
01:37:41,135 --> 01:37:42,669
What not to touch you?
What are you saying?

1125
01:37:42,670 --> 01:37:44,204
What are you saying! Tell me!

1126
01:37:44,205 --> 01:37:45,939
Shall I tell you?
- Yes!

1127
01:37:45,940 --> 01:37:48,875
Either you are a thief
or a big fool!

1128
01:37:48,876 --> 01:37:51,078
I am a thief!
- Prakash-bhai! I am a thief!

1129
01:37:51,079 --> 01:37:52,679
- Stop it, Prakash-bhai!
What are you doing?

1130
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:54,281
Move, Vikram! I will just tell you!

1131
01:37:54,282 --> 01:37:55,849
Ask him how he keeps the accounts?

1132
01:37:55,850 --> 01:37:58,051
What? I keep the accounts! . .

1133
01:37:58,052 --> 01:38:01,052
. . Shardul-bhai. .
- Move!

1134
01:38:01,889 --> 01:38:03,090
Hi!
- How are you? Fine.

1135
01:38:03,091 --> 01:38:04,825
Thanks. Where is Prakash?
- Upstairs.

1136
01:38:04,826 --> 01:38:07,826
Upstairs. Thanks.

1137
01:38:09,564 --> 01:38:11,998
Pakiya! I will break your teeth!

1138
01:38:11,999 --> 01:38:14,999
Stop it! - Stop it man!
- He hit me, pal.

1139
01:38:15,770 --> 01:38:17,971
You will have to share
the loss as a partner!

1140
01:38:17,972 --> 01:38:20,972
To hell with the loss! I dissolve
this partnership!

1141
01:38:21,142 --> 01:38:24,142
I don't need any partnership.
- You've touched me. . - Stop it!

1142
01:38:24,846 --> 01:38:27,846
You're going to hit me?
- If I had not put the money!

1143
01:38:27,849 --> 01:38:29,316
Beauty Parlour! Explain to him!

1144
01:38:29,317 --> 01:38:31,651
Whom are you talking to?
- To you!

1145
01:38:31,652 --> 01:38:32,886
Whom did you call Beauty Parlour?

1146
01:38:32,887 --> 01:38:34,988
What will you do?
- You will smash my face!

1147
01:38:34,989 --> 01:38:36,323
Stop it!
- Leave me!

1148
01:38:36,324 --> 01:38:38,158
What will you do? Tell me!

1149
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:40,160
Hey! Explain to him! Move!

1150
01:38:40,161 --> 01:38:43,161
You I'll. . ?
- What do you think of yourself?

1151
01:38:43,731 --> 01:38:45,932
Guys! Relax, man!

1152
01:38:45,933 --> 01:38:47,868
There is a loss! We will
have to share it!

1153
01:38:47,869 --> 01:38:49,002
We will pay the money tomorrow.

1154
01:38:49,003 --> 01:38:50,170
We will think about the rest later!

1155
01:38:50,171 --> 01:38:52,873
He wants money! That's why. .
- No!

1156
01:38:52,874 --> 01:38:55,742
I will give you the money!
Take this! - Varsha!

1157
01:38:55,743 --> 01:38:57,711
What are you doing? Stop it!

1158
01:38:57,712 --> 01:38:58,845
No! Take the money!

1159
01:38:58,846 --> 01:39:01,681
Relax! Relax! Just relax!

1160
01:39:01,682 --> 01:39:04,682
What's wrong with you?

1161
01:39:14,562 --> 01:39:16,863
Take this! If this
is less, then this!

1162
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:19,566
Chickoo's FDs! You can break
it or mortgage it!

1163
01:39:19,567 --> 01:39:22,567
You can do anything you want!

1164
01:39:23,237 --> 01:39:24,905
Varsha, I don't need so much!

1165
01:39:24,906 --> 01:39:26,973
Why? Don't you want to gamble today?

1166
01:39:26,974 --> 01:39:29,042
You will face shortage of money.

1167
01:39:29,043 --> 01:39:31,178
You can return the money whenever
you win in gambling.

1168
01:39:31,179 --> 01:39:33,580
Do one thing. No need
to return it too.

1169
01:39:33,581 --> 01:39:34,981
As it is till now I only have
been running the household.

1170
01:39:34,982 --> 01:39:36,583
I will run it in the future
too. Don't worry.

1171
01:39:36,584 --> 01:39:39,052
Why are you creating a scene?
I said I am sorry.

1172
01:39:39,053 --> 01:39:41,521
I am creating a scene! And you
are singing devotional songs.

1173
01:39:41,522 --> 01:39:43,523
Prakash, you are. .

1174
01:39:43,524 --> 01:39:46,524
Just. . pack your bags
and leave, Prakash!

1175
01:40:00,675 --> 01:40:03,675
Take this! Count it!

1176
01:40:24,265 --> 01:40:26,833
It's fake!

1177
01:40:26,834 --> 01:40:28,568
It's fake!

1178
01:40:28,569 --> 01:40:31,569
It's fake!

1179
01:40:33,641 --> 01:40:36,576
80,000 rupees in this
red bag is counterfeit

1180
01:40:36,577 --> 01:40:39,577
From where did you get it? From
where did you get it? - 80!

1181
01:40:40,781 --> 01:40:42,582
Mr. Naidu, the money comes
from many sources!

1182
01:40:42,583 --> 01:40:45,519
This 80,000 has come from
one source, Shardul-bhai!

1183
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:48,520
From where?

1184
01:40:49,857 --> 01:40:52,857
I have filled the visa forms.

1185
01:40:52,927 --> 01:40:55,161
What should I write
the marital status?

1186
01:40:55,162 --> 01:40:57,230
Write the truth. The more we lie. .

1187
01:40:57,231 --> 01:41:00,231
. .the more complicated
it will become.

1188
01:41:01,802 --> 01:41:03,803
What has happened to you?

1189
01:41:03,804 --> 01:41:06,804
Since you have returned from
Goa, something is wrong.

1190
01:41:07,608 --> 01:41:09,209
You didn't bring the visa
for the Julie, did you?

1191
01:41:09,210 --> 01:41:12,210
Vikram stop kidding, do
you get visa for a cat.

1192
01:41:12,813 --> 01:41:15,813
Pizza.

1193
01:41:19,820 --> 01:41:22,820
Shardul-bhai.
- What?

1194
01:41:23,824 --> 01:41:26,126
Where did you bring this from?

1195
01:41:26,127 --> 01:41:27,260
I didn't understand what?

1196
01:41:27,261 --> 01:41:29,162
You gave me 3 1/2 lakh
in the morning. .

1197
01:41:29,163 --> 01:41:30,664
. .where did you get it from?

1198
01:41:30,665 --> 01:41:33,133
Look at this.

1199
01:41:33,134 --> 01:41:35,235
Can you see the watermark
anywhere? This. .

1200
01:41:35,236 --> 01:41:37,737
More than half of the notes
are fake! - More than half.

1201
01:41:37,738 --> 01:41:39,573
Counterfeit. You gave it to me?

1202
01:41:39,574 --> 01:41:42,242
I handed it over to Naidu, he
started counting right there. .

1203
01:41:42,243 --> 01:41:43,910
. . he recognised it in a second.

1204
01:41:43,911 --> 01:41:45,045
Now he wanted information from me,

1205
01:41:45,046 --> 01:41:46,580
how did I get it. . who
gave it to me.

1206
01:41:46,581 --> 01:41:49,581
If I would have taken your name. .
then I would have been entrapped.

1207
01:41:49,984 --> 01:41:51,117
Thank you Shardul-bhai.

1208
01:41:51,118 --> 01:41:52,252
I will return you your money. Did
I come here. .

1209
01:41:52,253 --> 01:41:53,787
. .to ask for money?

1210
01:41:53,788 --> 01:41:55,522
Find out where did you get it from?

1211
01:41:55,523 --> 01:41:57,924
They are sitting in my club,
they are troubling me. .

1212
01:41:57,925 --> 01:41:59,960
. .they want information!

1213
01:41:59,961 --> 01:42:02,961
'I'll give you your money. . '

1214
01:42:13,107 --> 01:42:14,708
No reply.

1215
01:42:14,709 --> 01:42:15,842
I have a friend Shankar.

1216
01:42:15,843 --> 01:42:18,011
He is a very straight man, someone
must have fooled him.

1217
01:42:18,012 --> 01:42:21,012
Give me sometime,
I will find it out.

1218
01:42:32,893 --> 01:42:35,161
Now I understood why
you are so nervous. .

1219
01:42:35,162 --> 01:42:36,596
. .your girlfriend is inside,
isn't she?

1220
01:42:36,597 --> 01:42:38,064
Do think I can eat this
whole pizza alone?

1221
01:42:38,065 --> 01:42:39,666
What is her name?

1222
01:42:39,667 --> 01:42:40,800
Twinkle.

1223
01:42:40,801 --> 01:42:42,636
Twinkle, twinkle little star.

1224
01:42:42,637 --> 01:42:44,037
Shardul! Shardul brother
where are you going?

1225
01:42:44,038 --> 01:42:47,038
Let me meet her. - Shardul, please
no Shardul. . Shardul bhai!

1226
01:42:48,509 --> 01:42:51,509
Will you like it if
I enter your bedroom?

1227
01:42:58,119 --> 01:43:01,119
Minni.

1228
01:43:01,756 --> 01:43:02,889
You are in the cupboard. This
is the last time. .

1229
01:43:02,890 --> 01:43:04,791
. .I have come to your house.

1230
01:43:04,792 --> 01:43:06,126
If you want, sign on the visa form. .

1231
01:43:06,127 --> 01:43:07,661
. .or else I will leave alone!

1232
01:43:07,662 --> 01:43:09,929
Don't take this bag home.

1233
01:43:09,930 --> 01:43:11,931
Stupid! - Minni.

1234
01:43:11,932 --> 01:43:14,932
He will take me to Canada.
- Minni.

1235
01:43:16,137 --> 01:43:19,137
Mini!

1236
01:43:46,767 --> 01:43:49,767
. . How are you Naidu sir?

1237
01:43:49,770 --> 01:43:51,171
What about the Hyderabad's flight?

1238
01:43:51,172 --> 01:43:53,239
That, I cancelled it.
- Okay.

1239
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:55,208
There is an important meeting
in the evening. - Later.

1240
01:43:55,209 --> 01:43:56,743
Shall we play a hand?

1241
01:43:56,744 --> 01:43:58,111
No, no, no you play.

1242
01:43:58,112 --> 01:44:00,580
Do you want to take my shirt too?

1243
01:44:00,581 --> 01:44:01,848
They are upstairs,
you can go and play.

1244
01:44:01,849 --> 01:44:03,083
Okay, I hope you won't
give me fake notes?

1245
01:44:03,084 --> 01:44:05,785
What, what did you say?

1246
01:44:05,786 --> 01:44:07,754
Like last time, I hope you won't
give fake note this time too.

1247
01:44:07,755 --> 01:44:10,755
Who gave you fake notes?
- Shardul did. 80,000.

1248
01:44:12,059 --> 01:44:13,560
You are joking, Shardul
gave you fake notes. .

1249
01:44:13,561 --> 01:44:15,528
. .worth 80,000.
- Take a look.

1250
01:44:15,529 --> 01:44:18,529
They are of very good quality,
but I recognised it.

1251
01:44:23,671 --> 01:44:25,205
What did he say, who gave it to him?

1252
01:44:25,206 --> 01:44:27,107
He is not ready to say.

1253
01:44:27,108 --> 01:44:30,108
He says that even he doesn't know.

1254
01:44:30,211 --> 01:44:32,011
Okay, please carry on.

1255
01:44:32,012 --> 01:44:35,012
Good luck.

1256
01:44:36,117 --> 01:44:37,617
Tony.

1257
01:44:37,618 --> 01:44:39,552
Where are you Tony?

1258
01:44:39,553 --> 01:44:42,553
Come. . Look after the club,
I will just come.

1259
01:44:43,157 --> 01:44:45,558
These are the designs that
are used in the serials. .

1260
01:44:45,559 --> 01:44:48,559
. . listen to me. I'm not
forcing you to listen to me.

1261
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:55,600
Pakya.

1262
01:44:55,636 --> 01:44:56,770
What is this?
- Nothing.

1263
01:44:56,771 --> 01:44:58,571
Listen Pakya, where
are you going?. .

1264
01:44:58,572 --> 01:44:59,806
To bring back your jewellery
and money.

1265
01:44:59,807 --> 01:45:02,575
Listen to me.
- Shardul has taken my money. .

1266
01:45:02,576 --> 01:45:05,078
. .don't stop me.
- Pakya please.

1267
01:45:05,079 --> 01:45:07,514
Pakya?

1268
01:45:07,515 --> 01:45:10,515
Go in.

1269
01:45:25,166 --> 01:45:27,100
Prakash-bhai.
- Where are you?

1270
01:45:27,101 --> 01:45:30,101
I am at home. - I have found
out who has done this.

1271
01:45:32,807 --> 01:45:35,108
Who?
- Shardul.

1272
01:45:35,109 --> 01:45:38,109
Shardul.

1273
01:45:38,879 --> 01:45:41,481
We were supposed to meet
at Seshadri sir's house. .

1274
01:45:41,482 --> 01:45:43,483
. .with 50 lakhs, on
the 23rd remember.

1275
01:45:43,484 --> 01:45:44,617
When you had gone to Goa. .

1276
01:45:44,618 --> 01:45:47,153
Yes, I remember.
I mortgaged my wife's parlour. .

1277
01:45:47,154 --> 01:45:49,055
. .withdrew all my bank balance. .

1278
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:52,056
. .still I was short
of 8 lakh rupees.

1279
01:45:52,159 --> 01:45:55,159
Now, I was not going to
request to Shardul.

1280
01:45:56,030 --> 01:45:59,030
I called my friend Mukariya,
he prints fake notes.

1281
01:46:00,734 --> 01:46:03,734
I took 8 lakh rupees from him and
mixed it in the 2 1/2 crores.

1282
01:46:04,104 --> 01:46:05,572
Saying that when the deal is done. .

1283
01:46:05,573 --> 01:46:08,573
. .I will say sorry to Seshadri
sir and adjust it.

1284
01:46:08,843 --> 01:46:11,843
But, the money was stolen.
It was stolen.

1285
01:46:13,180 --> 01:46:16,180
Now listen, today I got
my own fake note back. .

1286
01:46:17,852 --> 01:46:19,586
. .from Parikh and Naidu.

1287
01:46:19,587 --> 01:46:22,587
Now ask me who gave them
that fake note, ask me.

1288
01:46:22,857 --> 01:46:25,158
Who?
- Shardul!

1289
01:46:25,159 --> 01:46:28,159
That means Shardul had
committed the robbery.

1290
01:46:29,763 --> 01:46:32,763
He has killed Shiva.

1291
01:46:32,833 --> 01:46:35,833
And that scoundrel Shardul
has murdered Seshadri sir.

1292
01:46:38,205 --> 01:46:39,806
Did you talk to him?

1293
01:46:39,807 --> 01:46:41,641
What should I talk to him?

1294
01:46:41,642 --> 01:46:44,544
I have come to you, let
us go drag him out. .

1295
01:46:44,545 --> 01:46:47,545
. .then get the money, and take
him to a lonely place. .

1296
01:46:47,548 --> 01:46:50,548
. .and kill him.

1297
01:46:51,051 --> 01:46:52,185
What are you looking at?

1298
01:46:52,186 --> 01:46:55,186
Call him.

1299
01:46:57,491 --> 01:47:00,491
Where should I call him?

1300
01:47:13,641 --> 01:47:16,641
Why are you taking tension,
I will shoot him.

1301
01:47:17,077 --> 01:47:20,077
Don't be afraid, let that
scoundrel Shardul come.

1302
01:47:22,983 --> 01:47:25,084
If I knew all this is
going to happen. .

1303
01:47:25,085 --> 01:47:27,520
. .then I would have never done it.

1304
01:47:27,521 --> 01:47:30,521
Who knew it? Did you know it? Did
I know it? Did Shiva know it?

1305
01:47:31,191 --> 01:47:34,127
Shardul is a serpent.

1306
01:47:34,128 --> 01:47:36,062
Shiva's death was an accident.

1307
01:47:36,063 --> 01:47:39,063
It was not an accident it
is all Shardul's doing.

1308
01:47:39,733 --> 01:47:41,601
Why don't you listen to me?

1309
01:47:41,602 --> 01:47:44,602
I didn't want to kill Shiva.

1310
01:47:45,873 --> 01:47:48,873
Seshadri sir found out everything.

1311
01:47:55,883 --> 01:47:58,883
Why did you take me to Shardul?

1312
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:15,760
Varsha?
- Where is Prakash?

1313
01:49:15,896 --> 01:49:18,896
What happened?
- Prakash has still not come home.

1314
01:49:24,104 --> 01:49:26,906
I don't know where he has
gone since afternoon.

1315
01:49:26,907 --> 01:49:28,641
His phone is switched off too.

1316
01:49:28,642 --> 01:49:30,643
He was at home in the morning.

1317
01:49:30,644 --> 01:49:32,912
Then he came home at 4 o'clock.

1318
01:49:32,913 --> 01:49:35,913
Without saying anything, he
took the pistol and left.

1319
01:49:36,784 --> 01:49:39,784
He was saying that Shardul
has stolen the money.

1320
01:49:40,587 --> 01:49:42,188
Shardul has stolen the money!

1321
01:49:42,189 --> 01:49:45,189
I have already called Shardul,
he says I don't know anything.

1322
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:47,727
He just met Prakash
once in the morning. .

1323
01:49:47,728 --> 01:49:50,728
. .I don't know anything else.

1324
01:49:50,831 --> 01:49:53,831
I am very scared Vikram.

1325
01:49:55,602 --> 01:49:58,602
Today morning we had
a very big argument.

1326
01:50:01,608 --> 01:50:03,876
Don't worry Varsha.

1327
01:50:03,877 --> 01:50:05,878
You had an argument with him. .

1328
01:50:05,879 --> 01:50:08,879
. . he must be sitting in some
bar, to make you worry.

1329
01:50:10,951 --> 01:50:12,618
He could have called, he knows
that I will be fine. .

1330
01:50:12,619 --> 01:50:15,619
. . if he calls once.

1331
01:50:16,056 --> 01:50:18,758
He could have called you,
you are his friend.

1332
01:50:18,759 --> 01:50:21,759
He is mad, doesn't understand
anything.

1333
01:50:25,866 --> 01:50:28,866
Come on, I will drop you home.

1334
01:50:29,636 --> 01:50:32,636
Pakya will return by morning.

1335
01:50:42,583 --> 01:50:45,583
Pull it up.

1336
01:50:46,854 --> 01:50:49,854
Still up. Still up.

1337
01:50:50,591 --> 01:50:53,591
Keep it going.

1338
01:51:34,902 --> 01:51:37,902
Prakash.

1339
01:51:43,076 --> 01:51:46,012
Shardul did all this?

1340
01:51:46,013 --> 01:51:49,013
He also killed Shiva and Seshadri.

1341
01:51:49,583 --> 01:51:52,583
You will not spare him.

1342
01:51:58,058 --> 01:52:01,058
I will. I will control myself.

1343
01:52:04,831 --> 01:52:07,831
But whenever I think about Chickoo. .

1344
01:52:08,001 --> 01:52:09,936
. .when I will go home, he will ask.

1345
01:52:09,937 --> 01:52:12,937
Where is papa, what will I tell him.

1346
01:52:15,609 --> 01:52:18,609
Prakash, papa has left us.

1347
01:52:43,070 --> 01:52:46,070
Now only me and you are
left Shardul-bhai.

1348
01:52:47,841 --> 01:52:50,176
Then what?

1349
01:52:50,177 --> 01:52:53,177
Look at me, you mean to
say that I killed him.

1350
01:52:55,716 --> 01:52:56,916
I am not saying that.

1351
01:52:56,917 --> 01:52:59,917
Then what are you saying?

1352
01:53:03,991 --> 01:53:06,991
Then who can it be?
- How would I know?

1353
01:53:07,027 --> 01:53:10,027
If I find out, then. .

1354
01:53:12,566 --> 01:53:15,566
I don't want this, I
don't want all this.

1355
01:53:15,602 --> 01:53:16,869
I am feeling very strange!

1356
01:53:16,870 --> 01:53:19,870
He is not there, I am
feeling very strange.

1357
01:53:21,608 --> 01:53:24,608
Who is doing all this?

1358
01:53:25,545 --> 01:53:28,545
Who is it?

1359
01:53:36,623 --> 01:53:39,623
Apply the brake.

1360
01:53:40,994 --> 01:53:43,994
Bring some water.

1361
01:53:55,042 --> 01:53:57,576
Das Auto Works. Pune.

1362
01:53:57,577 --> 01:54:00,577
23rd.

1363
01:54:56,103 --> 01:54:59,103
"As the moonlight touches."

1364
01:54:59,573 --> 01:55:02,573
"A spark turns into flames."

1365
01:55:02,576 --> 01:55:05,576
"Who will win?"

1366
01:55:05,846 --> 01:55:08,846
"The darkness or light."

1367
01:55:09,583 --> 01:55:12,583
"Is it poison or is it an antidote."

1368
01:55:12,853 --> 01:55:15,853
"It is chaos or is it a boon."

1369
01:55:16,089 --> 01:55:19,089
"Who knows who will be deceived?"

1370
01:55:26,133 --> 01:55:29,133
"It is such a grave secret."

1371
01:55:32,139 --> 01:55:33,606
A. C. P Naidu and Dang
are going to come. .

1372
01:55:33,607 --> 01:55:36,607
. .I will make the arrangements,
you wait.

1373
01:55:39,112 --> 01:55:42,112
"It is such a grave secret."

1374
01:55:45,986 --> 01:55:48,986
"It is such a mysterious night."

1375
01:56:04,171 --> 01:56:05,838
Vikram is inside.

1376
01:56:05,839 --> 01:56:07,573
Until I return, take such
good care of him. .

1377
01:56:07,574 --> 01:56:10,574
. .so that he stays inside.

1378
01:56:12,846 --> 01:56:14,580
"Hey Johnny."

1379
01:56:14,581 --> 01:56:16,582
"Let's go bam, bam."

1380
01:56:16,583 --> 01:56:19,583
"It's you, or me or me or you."

1381
01:56:19,853 --> 01:56:21,053
"Hey Johnny."

1382
01:56:21,054 --> 01:56:22,822
"Let's go bam, bam, bam."

1383
01:56:22,823 --> 01:56:25,823
"It's you, or me or me or you."

1384
01:56:26,860 --> 01:56:29,860
"There are all hidden faces here."

1385
01:56:29,930 --> 01:56:32,930
"It is a world of masks."

1386
01:56:33,133 --> 01:56:36,133
"You can come if you want to."

1387
01:56:36,670 --> 01:56:39,670
"Wearing a mask."

1388
01:56:39,973 --> 01:56:42,973
"IN the crowd here."

1389
01:56:43,543 --> 01:56:46,543
"Whom will you run into?"

1390
01:56:46,913 --> 01:56:49,913
"It is forbidden to call
anyone a friend."

1391
01:59:21,635 --> 01:59:22,768
Yes.

1392
01:59:22,769 --> 01:59:25,769
Yes.

1393
01:59:29,643 --> 01:59:32,643
Money.

1394
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:01,400
You.

1395
02:00:18,854 --> 02:00:20,387
Everything happened right
in front of my eye. .

1396
02:00:20,388 --> 02:00:23,388
. .and I couldn't see anything.
- What happened?

1397
02:00:23,658 --> 02:00:26,658
It is my mistake, I thought
he was a child and. .

1398
02:00:27,429 --> 02:00:30,429
Scoundrel.
- Who?

1399
02:00:30,699 --> 02:00:33,699
Vikram.

1400
02:00:55,824 --> 02:00:58,824
Pick up, pick up, pick up please.

1401
02:01:03,331 --> 02:01:05,866
Yeah, you carry on no, I'll call you.
Anything else. - No thanks.

1402
02:01:05,867 --> 02:01:08,867
Okay enjoy yourself bye.

1403
02:01:37,365 --> 02:01:40,365
I am back.

1404
02:01:43,371 --> 02:01:44,538
Okay, I will take your leave.

1405
02:01:44,539 --> 02:01:46,440
Sit, sit, sit, sit.

1406
02:01:46,441 --> 02:01:49,441
Finish your drink, sit.

1407
02:02:12,901 --> 02:02:15,669
The money is kept in my garage.

1408
02:02:15,670 --> 02:02:18,405
How did you find out?

1409
02:02:18,406 --> 02:02:21,406
Under the bonnet of your car,
it had the sticker. .

1410
02:02:21,409 --> 02:02:24,409
. .of the garage in Pune.
- Sticker?

1411
02:02:24,412 --> 02:02:27,412
You chose the right name. Johnny G.

1412
02:02:34,856 --> 02:02:37,856
Johnny Gaddar!

1413
02:02:46,368 --> 02:02:49,368
Twinkle.

1414
02:02:53,375 --> 02:02:55,376
I have understood everything, I
just can't understand one thing. .

1415
02:02:55,377 --> 02:02:57,378
. . how did Seshadri and
Prakash find out. .

1416
02:02:57,379 --> 02:03:00,379
. .that too, before me.

1417
02:03:00,382 --> 02:03:01,849
Tell me.

1418
02:03:01,850 --> 02:03:04,850
It is a long time, I will
tell you some other time.

1419
02:03:05,353 --> 02:03:07,354
You don't have time, tell
me now you scoundrel. .

1420
02:03:07,355 --> 02:03:10,355
. .tell me now!

1421
02:03:12,894 --> 02:03:15,894
Shardul-bhai, won't you believe me?

1422
02:03:17,832 --> 02:03:20,832
I didn't want to kill anyone?
- Then, what should I do?

1423
02:03:23,405 --> 02:03:26,405
Forgive you, let you go, spare you!

1424
02:03:27,409 --> 02:03:30,409
How did Seshadri find out, tell me?

1425
02:03:32,347 --> 02:03:35,347
Tell me!

1426
02:03:37,619 --> 02:03:40,619
These questions will trouble
you all your life.

1427
02:03:44,826 --> 02:03:47,826
Vikram!

1428
02:03:58,973 --> 02:04:01,375
He knows everything about us.

1429
02:04:01,376 --> 02:04:04,376
Are you fine?

1430
02:04:43,418 --> 02:04:45,919
Now what shall we do?

1431
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:48,322
We don't have any way?

1432
02:04:48,323 --> 02:04:51,323
We are trapped very badly.

1433
02:04:51,826 --> 02:04:53,360
What should I do, I cannot
understand anything. .

1434
02:04:53,361 --> 02:04:56,361
. .I cannot understand anything.

1435
02:04:56,631 --> 02:04:59,366
We can do one thing,
call the police. .

1436
02:04:59,367 --> 02:05:02,367
. .I will tell the truth. I loved
you, he was about to kill you. .

1437
02:05:02,370 --> 02:05:04,772
. .everything, I will tell
them the entire truth!

1438
02:05:04,773 --> 02:05:07,773
We don't have any other choice.

1439
02:05:08,643 --> 02:05:10,377
Yes, we can do one more thing.

1440
02:05:10,378 --> 02:05:12,446
Before anyone sees us, we
can runaway from here.

1441
02:05:12,447 --> 02:05:15,382
Vikram, do you understand
what I am saying. .

1442
02:05:15,383 --> 02:05:17,718
. .Vikram are you listening
what I am saying, Vikram. .

1443
02:05:17,719 --> 02:05:20,719
Minni calm down.

1444
02:05:21,356 --> 02:05:24,356
Other than us, no one knows that
Shardul had come back here.

1445
02:05:26,528 --> 02:05:28,395
I will get rid of Sharduls corpse. .

1446
02:05:28,396 --> 02:05:30,397
. .so that when the police
find it, it doesn't have. .

1447
02:05:30,398 --> 02:05:31,565
. .any connection with us.

1448
02:05:31,566 --> 02:05:34,401
The police should believe that
when Shardul was killed. .

1449
02:05:34,402 --> 02:05:37,402
. .at that time, both of us were
right here, in the club.

1450
02:05:37,405 --> 02:05:40,340
I don't understand what
you are saying?

1451
02:05:40,341 --> 02:05:42,342
First of all, you will
go out of here. .

1452
02:05:42,343 --> 02:05:44,344
. .and after exactly five minutes
come in the club. .

1453
02:05:44,345 --> 02:05:45,512
. .through the main entrance.
- But. .

1454
02:05:45,513 --> 02:05:46,647
You will find Lawrence there.

1455
02:05:46,648 --> 02:05:48,715
Tell Lawrence that you
want to meet me.

1456
02:05:48,716 --> 02:05:50,684
Vikram, I cant understand anything
that you are saying.

1457
02:05:50,685 --> 02:05:51,985
Please you. .
- Minni!

1458
02:05:51,986 --> 02:05:53,320
First of all, you will
go out of here. .

1459
02:05:53,321 --> 02:05:56,321
. .and after exactly five minutes. .

1460
02:06:26,855 --> 02:06:29,855
Madam, Shardul sir has gone out.

1461
02:06:30,358 --> 02:06:33,358
I know, he had called he
is coming in an hour.

1462
02:06:33,661 --> 02:06:35,829
I want to meet Mr. Vikram.
- Why not, here he is. - Hi.

1463
02:06:35,830 --> 02:06:38,830
Feel comfortable please.

1464
02:06:41,803 --> 02:06:44,338
We don't want any disturbance. Sure.

1465
02:06:44,339 --> 02:06:46,340
Shall I send coffee?

1466
02:06:46,341 --> 02:06:49,341
No thanks, no coffee, no tea
I don't want anything.

1467
02:07:06,628 --> 02:07:09,363
Now what?

1468
02:07:09,364 --> 02:07:11,365
We cannot leave Shardul's car here.

1469
02:07:11,366 --> 02:07:14,366
We will have to get rid of
the car and the corpse.

1470
02:07:23,378 --> 02:07:24,645
What are you doing?

1471
02:07:24,646 --> 02:07:27,646
Even if anyone sees me, they will
think that Shardul is driving.

1472
02:07:29,384 --> 02:07:31,652
I will take 2-3 taxis and return.

1473
02:07:31,653 --> 02:07:33,353
Until I don't return, under
no circumstances. .

1474
02:07:33,354 --> 02:07:36,354
. .will you open the front door.

1475
02:07:37,492 --> 02:07:40,492
Everyone should feel, that
I am here with you.

1476
02:07:43,665 --> 02:07:46,400
If I am late Minni,
don't be scared. .

1477
02:07:46,401 --> 02:07:49,401
. .everything will be fine now.

1478
02:07:51,673 --> 02:07:54,673
Wait for me.

1479
02:08:53,835 --> 02:08:56,835
I met such customers.

1480
02:10:04,906 --> 02:10:07,906
Good that I killed him.

1481
02:10:09,677 --> 02:10:12,677
I killed him.

1482
02:10:13,681 --> 02:10:16,681
Yes Prakash, I killed Shardul.

1483
02:10:22,557 --> 02:10:25,557
Shardul is dead.

1484
02:10:27,428 --> 02:10:30,428

Tell me what is your name?
