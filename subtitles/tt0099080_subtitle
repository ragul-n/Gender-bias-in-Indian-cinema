In this year of the girl, we
dedicate our film to these women ..

00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,999
.. that have been victimized
by lust and greed, and are ..

00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,400
..somed to social rejection, and in
addition, we praise those who ..

00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,572
They strive to raise them.

BAAGHI - A REBEL FOR LOVE
(REBEL- A REBEL FOR LOVE)

7
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:12,300
Saajan! Saajan!

8
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:15,300
Saajan!

9
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:26,700
- Good morning Colonel.
- Yes, good morning soldier.

10
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:30,100
- Serves breakfast, Ram Singh.
- Yes sir.

11
00:04:30,564 --> 00:04:33,100
That milk? Where did you get it?

12
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:37,700
Sir, from the young man's room.

13
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:40,400
It seems that the night did not drink his milk.

14
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,600
- Saajan did not drink the milk?
- No, I did not drink it.

15
00:04:43,845 --> 00:04:46,400
He must not have exercised either.

16
00:04:46,981 --> 00:04:48,900
Well... I... I did not see that.

17
00:04:49,183 --> 00:04:51,681
- Maybe he did ..
- Come on, serve the table, come on.

18
00:05:03,312 --> 00:05:04,515
Good morning sir.

19
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:14,715
Good morning.

20
00:05:18,612 --> 00:05:22,315
Wait! Why did not you exercise today?

21
00:05:22,617 --> 00:05:25,000
- Yes, I do.
- How much did you exercise?

22
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:28,300
Two arm tensions,
one arm flexion?

23
00:05:29,023 --> 00:05:30,784
Do not try to make excuses.

24
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:33,185
Ram Singh told me everything.

25
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:42,200
Why did you tell him that?

26
00:05:42,704 --> 00:05:44,204
Answer me.

27
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,735
Why did not you exercise or do yoga?
Why not?

28
00:05:49,243 --> 00:05:51,668
- I woke up late.
- Why did you wake up late?

29
00:05:52,346 --> 00:05:54,915
- Because I slept late.
- Why did you go to bed late?

30
00:05:57,351 --> 00:05:58,951
You must be punished, you know?

31
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:02,051
Yes sir.

32
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,251
- No breakfast.
- Right.

33
00:06:04,651 --> 00:06:05,351
Go away!

34
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,200
What are you doing? Today is
his first day at university.

35
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,600
- Will he get hungry all day?
- Yeah!

36
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:14,600
Now he will remember that he
is the son of a Colonel ..

37
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,000
..and the grandson of a General.

38
00:06:16,537 --> 00:06:18,500
You have to join the
Academy next year.

39
00:06:18,703 --> 00:06:20,200
To be a military officer.

40
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:22,800
And you can never be a good officer ..

41
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,109
..a man who breaks
rules and discipline.

42
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:27,109
- Now you understand, woman?
Yes.

43
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:31,176
Your? Why are you still here? Go away.

44
00:06:36,815 --> 00:06:37,876
Come on! Come on!

45
00:06:44,832 --> 00:06:47,100
Hey! You came to this house for me.

46
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:49,259
At least wait for me once!

47
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:54,507
You better be careful
with me, gossipy, I...

48
00:06:55,043 --> 00:06:57,204
- Ram Singh!
- There I go, sir!

49
00:06:57,503 --> 00:06:59,204
Saajan! Saajan!

50
00:07:00,314 --> 00:07:01,200
Wait!

51
00:07:03,117 --> 00:07:05,409
- Here you have.
- Thanks, I needed it.

52
00:07:06,017 --> 00:07:07,709
- Vandana!
- There I go!

53
00:07:09,755 --> 00:07:12,200
Wonderful! How much he loves you!

54
00:07:12,527 --> 00:07:16,100
- He gave you my share of love to you.
- Enough, enough. Now go away.

55
00:07:48,462 --> 00:07:50,200
- Crushed!
- What?

56
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:53,557
- A sandwich.
- Sandwich?

57
00:07:53,704 --> 00:07:55,361
Yes.
- Sorry.

58
00:08:00,974 --> 00:08:03,000
- New?
- Yes, today is my first day.

59
00:08:03,277 --> 00:08:06,200
Take care of the guys
from this university.

60
00:08:06,781 --> 00:08:09,282
They are experts at
disturbing people.

61
00:08:10,584 --> 00:08:13,004
- Oh yeah?
- My name is Salim.

62
00:08:13,407 --> 00:08:15,500
People affectionately
call me Tempo.

63
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,100
If you want, you can
call me that too.

64
00:08:18,392 --> 00:08:20,700
But first you must give me a present.

65
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,387
- Insurance. But can I take my book?
- Yes, sure.

66
00:08:28,068 --> 00:08:29,135
- Now what?
- Are you here to study?

67
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:31,135
Probably. (sarcasm)

68
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:50,435
Can I come in, sir?

69
00:08:57,164 --> 00:08:59,000
I've never seen you before.

70
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,833
Today is my first day
in college, sir.

71
00:09:07,808 --> 00:09:10,100
- Why are you late?
- Looking for the classroom ..

72
00:09:10,343 --> 00:09:11,302
I was late, sir.

73
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:16,383
- Go sit down.
- Thank my Lord.

74
00:09:18,452 --> 00:09:20,620
Wait! Stand up.

75
00:09:21,922 --> 00:09:25,656
First introduce yourself to the class.

76
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:29,256
- My name is Saajan Sood
- Indian style!

77
00:09:30,097 --> 00:09:31,100
In Hindi.

78
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:33,700
- My name is Saajan Sood.
- Aha!

79
00:09:33,968 --> 00:09:37,200
My father is Colonel D.N.
Sood, was transferred here.

80
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:39,762
- Where were you before?
- In Madras (Chennai).

81
00:09:40,674 --> 00:09:43,300
Why did not you go to Bangalore?
It's closer.

82
00:09:43,611 --> 00:09:45,300
Sir, we have our own house here.

83
00:09:46,346 --> 00:09:49,581
This is the kind of psychology.
Take this book and read it.

84
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:52,281
Page 225.

85
00:09:53,246 --> 00:09:54,781
The sexuality of the child.

86
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,289
We have shown that children consider
their teacher as their mother.

87
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,789
Silence!

88
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:06,300
- Sir, namaskar.
- What's going on?

89
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:09,003
- Mr..
- Go sit down!

90
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:11,000
All seated!

91
00:10:11,205 --> 00:10:14,133
- You are a student?
- Oh yes, my child!

92
00:10:21,305 --> 00:10:22,133
Hello Baby!

93
00:10:31,605 --> 00:10:33,133
Hello Baby!

94
00:10:34,595 --> 00:10:38,200
- Hello.
- My name is Raju. I am orphaned.

95
00:10:38,632 --> 00:10:41,200
I belong where the river Ganga flows.

96
00:10:41,602 --> 00:10:43,100
It is forbidden to
sing in the library.

97
00:10:43,202 --> 00:10:44,800
Oh, come on my friend!

98
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,800
- Sing yeah. But not talking.
- Anything else you wanna say?

99
00:10:50,644 --> 00:10:52,935
Are you in first year?

100
00:10:53,547 --> 00:10:55,748
- Yes because?
- I'm in first year too.

101
00:10:56,047 --> 00:10:57,348
Nice to meet you.

102
00:11:03,424 --> 00:11:05,200
- Not coming?
- Where?

103
00:11:05,526 --> 00:11:08,550
Shit buddy! You do not know?
Today is the day of the clowns.

104
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:10,800
It is an old tradition
in this university.

105
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,200
Students do funny things
to make others laugh.

106
00:11:14,635 --> 00:11:17,100
The one who does the funniest
thing, wins a clown cap.

107
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:19,100
And a director award too.
Come on, buddy, come on.

108
00:11:19,874 --> 00:11:21,500
Come on now, my friend.

109
00:11:22,376 --> 00:11:24,009
Come on, it will be a lot of fun.

110
00:11:25,646 --> 00:11:28,215
- What is this?
- Everyone's ready, baby?

111
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:32,003
We are all ready!

112
00:11:44,998 --> 00:11:46,300
Hey! What is all this?

113
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:49,200
I told you friend that today
is the day of the clowns.

114
00:11:49,603 --> 00:11:51,600
We will win the prize this year.

115
00:11:51,806 --> 00:11:54,100
- Where is my bikini?
- Inside.

116
00:11:54,308 --> 00:11:57,200
- And his?
- Hey! I will not wear a bikini.

117
00:11:57,711 --> 00:12:00,200
If you go naked, they will kill you!

118
00:12:00,481 --> 00:12:03,600
Shit buddy! Dont be rude.
Come on, use it.

119
00:12:04,618 --> 00:12:07,700
Refill, idiot, why did you
bring him to him? It's new!

120
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:11,100
How would you know how
important this day is?

121
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,500
I brought it, because it is new.

122
00:12:13,728 --> 00:12:16,500
If he stays with us,
he'll get old soon.

123
00:12:16,731 --> 00:12:20,600
Hey brother! Will you use this
or humiliate us? Tell us!

124
00:12:21,535 --> 00:12:26,899
When an elephant could use it,
why not a rat? Come on, use it.

125
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,589
Close it! Quick!

126
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,600
Give me the keys, please.
Do not joke with me.

127
00:12:59,874 --> 00:13:02,001
Give me the keys! Please!

128
00:13:02,776 --> 00:13:04,467
Hey Buddha, Time, Refill!

129
00:13:17,725 --> 00:13:21,024
Do not close, please! Please!

130
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:04,200
Find out who that boy was ..

131
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:06,800
.. was playing cricket in a bikini.

132
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,400
Wearing a bikini in
college is not a trend!

133
00:14:09,643 --> 00:14:12,400
- I was out in a bikini, sir.
- Is the same.

134
00:14:12,646 --> 00:14:15,274
- Go and find out. Come on, go.
- Yes sir.

135
00:14:17,046 --> 00:14:18,674
Hello? If that?

136
00:14:19,352 --> 00:14:22,200
- Call me, sir?
- Yes, I asked for water.

137
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:23,824
There he is.

138
00:14:24,256 --> 00:14:25,524
Oh, thank you, thank you.

139
00:14:27,494 --> 00:14:29,800
- This pen does not write.
- Here's the ink.

140
00:14:30,064 --> 00:14:32,461
Okay. You can go now. Go.

141
00:14:52,753 --> 00:14:56,112
Look who's here?
The bikini boy! The bikini boy!

142
00:15:01,762 --> 00:15:03,300
Hey! Where is your bikini?

143
00:15:03,507 --> 00:15:05,727
- Do not ask in front of everyone.
- Shut up, shameless!

144
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:11,207
Hey Commander!

145
00:15:11,705 --> 00:15:13,100
Come! Come!

146
00:15:13,974 --> 00:15:15,132
Drink you!

147
00:15:15,574 --> 00:15:17,332
Today we will not remove your clothes! Come!

148
00:15:43,774 --> 00:15:46,300
Hey Buddha! Tempo! Shit friends!

149
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,839
- He's crying.
- What do you say, friend?

150
00:15:51,344 --> 00:15:54,100
Refill, go and convince the idiot.

151
00:15:54,648 --> 00:15:56,700
If he goes with the director,
we'll end up in trouble.

152
00:15:56,951 --> 00:15:59,300
That idiot can get us beat up.

153
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,551
- Go! Go!
- OK baby!

154
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,551
Commander! Commander!

155
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,051
Buddha! Tempo!

156
00:16:33,387 --> 00:16:35,646
- Mr! He hanged himself!
- Come on!

157
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,646
Call! Call everyone!

158
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,851
- Mr. Sharma, bring them to my office.
Yes.

159
00:17:12,492 --> 00:17:14,000
They should be ashamed!

160
00:17:14,628 --> 00:17:16,400
Are you making fun of your manager ?!

161
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,100
You should suspend them
for your jokes, sir.

162
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:22,125
That will, that will be the best.

163
00:17:22,636 --> 00:17:24,600
But sir, we do not
hang that doll.

164
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:27,266
Oh, I'm sure I'll be hanging alone, right?

165
00:17:27,641 --> 00:17:30,701
- Sir, it was the new boy's work.
- What guy ?!

166
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,101
Can I come in, sir?

167
00:17:37,784 --> 00:17:40,200
- Why?
- Because I'm standing outside.

168
00:17:40,954 --> 00:17:44,055
- Why are you out?
- Because I want to pass.

169
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:49,400
- Yeah, come in.
- I called him yesterday, sir.

170
00:17:50,663 --> 00:17:51,893
Yes Yes.

171
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:56,500
- Did you recognize me, sir?
- Yes, I recognized him!

172
00:17:56,737 --> 00:17:58,400
Please sit down.

173
00:17:58,972 --> 00:18:02,800
It looks the same as it did 40 years ago.

174
00:18:03,177 --> 00:18:06,112
As a child, I saw
his first movie.

175
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,410
- What was it called?
- "Hum Dono" (1961 - "We two")

176
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:13,800
You're wrong, sir.
I'm not Dev Anand.

177
00:18:14,088 --> 00:18:19,100
Johnny. Johnny is my name.
I'm his ex-student.

178
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:21,585
Oh! Johnny! My ex student!

179
00:18:22,388 --> 00:18:24,185
Where were you, my dear boy?

180
00:18:24,564 --> 00:18:29,596
Congratulations to your memory, sir.
He recognized me immediately.

181
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,500
Our family is famed for two things.
First is memory.

182
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:38,337
Once we see someone,
we never forget.

183
00:18:39,412 --> 00:18:40,700
And the second..

184
00:18:41,681 --> 00:18:43,500
Why you guys? Three are still here?

185
00:18:44,517 --> 00:18:46,600
I told them that they will not have vacations.
Go away!

186
00:18:47,487 --> 00:18:49,218
- Are we sure we're going?
- I said outside!

187
00:18:51,591 --> 00:18:53,900
They want vacations for silly things.

188
00:18:54,128 --> 00:18:56,100
What did he say, Mr. Johnny Walker?

189
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,127
- Johnny!
- Your name.

190
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:27,819
We stumble on the streets.

191
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:33,823
Dancing happily.

192
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,119
We stumble on the streets.

193
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:45,623
Dancing happily.

194
00:20:47,841 --> 00:20:50,500
We command, we do
not fear anyone.

195
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,500
Even if the world is angry,
it does not concern us.

196
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,500
Those who come from here, from there,
those who go from left to right.

197
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,100
Everyone calls us ..

198
00:20:59,453 --> 00:21:00,653
..callejeros.

199
00:21:01,603 --> 00:21:03,753
Street, street, street, street.

200
00:21:05,553 --> 00:21:06,653
Callejeros.

201
00:21:07,453 --> 00:21:12,053
Street, street, street, street.

202
00:21:41,604 --> 00:21:46,189
Borivali, Kandivali, Dombivli,
Chandivali, go anywhere.

203
00:21:47,604 --> 00:21:52,389
Everyone knows us friends, all Mumbai
knows our names and addresses.

204
00:21:53,504 --> 00:21:58,189
Borivali, Kandivali, Dombivli,
Chandivali, go anywhere.

205
00:21:59,504 --> 00:22:04,289
Everyone knows us friends, all Mumbai
knows our names and addresses.

206
00:22:05,602 --> 00:22:10,620
We are good in heart, we are noble.

207
00:22:11,604 --> 00:22:16,826
Even if the world is
divided, we are one.

208
00:22:17,607 --> 00:22:20,400
Those who come from here, from there,
those who go from left to right.

209
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:23,158
Everyone calls us ..

210
00:22:23,453 --> 00:22:24,453

Street, street, street, street.

00:22:29,353 --> 00:22:30,453
Callejeros.

213
00:22:31,103 --> 00:22:35,553
Street, street, street, street.

214
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:50,421
Oh, white beauty with black
hair, stop a moment.

215
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,394
You made our hearts beat, you
made us nervous, do not go there.

216
00:23:58,002 --> 00:24:02,221
Oh, white beauty with black
hair, stop a moment.

217
00:24:03,904 --> 00:24:08,394
You made our hearts beat, you
made us nervous, do not go there.

218
00:24:09,942 --> 00:24:14,945
Why do you stop on the road like this?

219
00:24:15,649 --> 00:24:21,149
We will give you our hearts,
come, fragrant flower.

220
00:24:21,707 --> 00:24:24,400
Those who come from here, from there,
those who go from left to right.

221
00:24:24,607 --> 00:24:27,158
Everyone calls us ..

222
00:24:27,453 --> 00:24:28,653

00:24:29,603 --> 00:24:31,453
Street, street, street, street.

224

Callejeros.

225
00:24:35,403 --> 00:24:40,153
Street, street, street, street.

226
00:24:42,605 --> 00:24:43,800
Hello mother.

227
00:24:44,077 --> 00:24:46,170
Hello! What happens?
Today you look very happy.

228
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,100
We had a lot of fun
at university today.

229
00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:51,500
- Did you make any friends?
- Yes, I made three friends.

230
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,577
Oh yeah?

231
00:24:54,607 --> 00:24:57,800
- Mama, where is the lord?
- He is in the program of the ..

232
00:24:58,091 --> 00:25:00,800
- .. ex-men association of the army.
- Again?

233
00:25:01,604 --> 00:25:07,328
Oh yeah. Your form from the academy
is here. He asked you to fill it.

234
00:25:07,601 --> 00:25:11,300
Mom, what will I do in the army?
I'm not that kind of guy.

235
00:25:11,705 --> 00:25:16,208
Those rifles, pistols, bullets, etc.
I do not like it for nothing!

236
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:20,100
- Why do not you tell the lord?
- Look, son.

237
00:25:20,512 --> 00:25:22,341
..is the tradition of this house.

238
00:25:23,049 --> 00:25:26,700
- It's not tradition. It is his stubbornness.
- Maybe.

239
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,400
But you know that he
always does what he wants.

240
00:25:30,604 --> 00:25:32,600
Mom, I'm your son.

241
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:36,100
It is my stubbornness that
I will choose my career.

242
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,026
- Oh yeah?
Yes.

243
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:50,600
Your career has already been chosen.

244
00:25:51,144 --> 00:25:54,300
You have to join the army.
Come on, fill out the form.

245
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,900
- Sir, please listen to me.
- Fill out the form!

246
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,550
- Sir, please listen to me.
- Fill out the form!

247
00:26:02,389 --> 00:26:04,553
Do you dare to disobey me ?!

248
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,653
You, damn civil idiot!

249
00:26:12,765 --> 00:26:17,159
I'll give you 48 hours, 48 hours.

250
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:21,100
Think wisely. If you do not
leave your stubbornness ..

251
00:26:21,424 --> 00:26:24,474
You will have to leave this
house forever, forever.

252
00:26:26,024 --> 00:26:27,404
Do you understand?

253
00:26:28,924 --> 00:26:29,804
Go away!

254
00:26:54,741 --> 00:26:56,100
You are his son.

255
00:26:56,676 --> 00:26:59,709
If you give in, will you
lose your self-respect?

256
00:27:01,213 --> 00:27:03,100
Mom, what do you want?

257
00:27:03,383 --> 00:27:05,142
I just want you

258
00:27:09,455 --> 00:27:10,214
Tell me.

259
00:27:14,227 --> 00:27:15,295
Tell me.

260
00:27:17,964 --> 00:27:18,932
Son!

261
00:27:27,273 --> 00:27:28,632
Fool!

262
00:27:31,244 --> 00:27:34,145
Come on, let me put you on a bandage.

263
00:27:41,254 --> 00:27:44,600
I told you before, do
not bother the girls.

264
00:27:45,158 --> 00:27:47,100
- What a slap, my friend!
- Tremendous slap buddy!

265
00:27:48,327 --> 00:27:51,661
Some girl would dare
touch Saajan Sood?

266
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:56,468
So the father of the girl should
give you a gift of love ?!

267
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:01,200
Love? There's no girl in my life.

268
00:28:02,441 --> 00:28:06,350
If the gentleman finds out... he'll
beat me up and leave me black.

269
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,313
What do you dream every day?
Army Parades?

270
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:13,184
Left, right, left,
right, rotate!

271
00:28:14,487 --> 00:28:16,200
- I dream of a girl.
- With whom?

272
00:28:16,456 --> 00:28:17,555
Sridevi?

273
00:28:17,806 --> 00:28:19,255
- Who is Sridevi?
- That, my friend.

274
00:28:22,762 --> 00:28:23,600
No no.

275
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,400
Thank God! Otherwise there
would have been a fight.

276
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:29,195
Because I dream about her too.

277
00:28:31,604 --> 00:28:35,934
- Tell us, who do you dream of? Tell us.
- I dream of a girl.

278
00:28:37,003 --> 00:28:40,400
When I approach her. Closer..

279
00:28:40,647 --> 00:28:42,100
- ..closer..
- Keep going..

280
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:43,100
Shut up my friend

281
00:28:44,216 --> 00:28:46,200
- She disappears.
- Oh, you...

282
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:48,900
Buddha, this is a serious situation.

283
00:28:49,122 --> 00:28:50,100
We need to do something.

284
00:28:50,323 --> 00:28:53,952
- Yeah, we need to do something.
- When will you do it?

285
00:28:55,328 --> 00:28:56,900
Do what?

286
00:29:11,607 --> 00:29:13,300
- This is not a nice place.
- Shut up idiot.

287
00:29:13,813 --> 00:29:15,600
This is the right
place for the young.

288
00:29:16,149 --> 00:29:18,300
- Suppose somebody sees us?
- And that?

289
00:29:18,551 --> 00:29:21,787
They will think that
the children grew up!

290
00:29:22,355 --> 00:29:26,300
Have you been here before?
I'm scared. Let's go mate.

291
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,100
- If the gentleman finds out ..
- Do not worry, I'm with you.

292
00:29:30,363 --> 00:29:32,400
Mr! Listen, sir!

293
00:29:32,699 --> 00:29:34,758
Sir, listen to me!

294
00:29:38,104 --> 00:29:42,004
He is smaller than we are.
But very sweet.

295
00:29:43,376 --> 00:29:46,675
But come with me, sir.

296
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:49,500
It is a wonderful place, you.
You will enjoy it.

297
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:53,400
I love you I love you.

298
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,174
I fell in love.

299
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:04,400
I love you I love you.

300
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,974
I fell in love.

301
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:15,174
I kill myself. I kill myself. I kill myself.

302
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:21,200
I love you I love you.

303
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:24,074
I fell in love.

304
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:28,400
I love you I love you.

305
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:32,174
I fell in love.

306
00:30:50,643 --> 00:30:51,700
Hey, Largo!

307
00:30:52,445 --> 00:30:54,600
Where did you get these kids?

308
00:30:55,448 --> 00:30:59,347
If you spoil these children,
the police will arrest you.

309
00:31:00,553 --> 00:31:02,900
- Got it?
"No, Madam Leela.

310
00:31:03,423 --> 00:31:05,500
These children were roaming the streets.

311
00:31:05,725 --> 00:31:10,000
I brought them for you to
guide them along the way.

312
00:31:11,425 --> 00:31:16,700
Before this, my love, such a
pleasant season had never come.

313
00:31:17,225 --> 00:31:23,000
Come, wet, it rains
youth from the clouds.

314
00:31:23,225 --> 00:31:30,600
On the slippery hill, I slip.

315
00:31:31,025 --> 00:31:38,000
On the slippery hill, I slip.

316
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:42,200
Come my king, come into my arms.

317
00:31:42,425 --> 00:31:44,800
See you, I start dancing.

318
00:31:45,525 --> 00:31:53,000
I have protected my
heart for 16 years.

319
00:31:55,605 --> 00:31:59,000
I love you I love you.

320
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:02,000
I fell in love.

321
00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:06,400
I love you I love you.

322
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,921
- Is this your first time here?
- No, I come every day.

323
00:32:11,724 --> 00:32:13,192
What do you think?

324
00:32:14,527 --> 00:32:17,758
Female dog! Are you alive?
Do not you agree?

325
00:32:21,527 --> 00:32:22,100
Jaggu!

326
00:32:22,368 --> 00:32:25,800
I'll kill you! Got it? We'll
see how you disagree!

327
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:28,300
Your drama will not
continue for much longer!

328
00:32:28,527 --> 00:32:29,200
Jaggu!

329
00:32:31,844 --> 00:32:34,500
Hey, Madam Leela! We must
do something about it!

330
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:36,647
This bitch became a nuisance!

331
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,100
Look, I'm going crazy!

332
00:32:40,606 --> 00:32:43,400
I will kill her! Trust me! I will kill her!

333
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:47,956
Jaggu, the girl is new!
Be patient.

334
00:32:49,261 --> 00:32:53,900
Everything will be fine. Now the
girl is here, she will learn soon.

335
00:32:54,607 --> 00:32:56,965
Everything will be fine. Just relax.

336
00:33:03,843 --> 00:33:08,075
Come, come, officer... it's your place!

337
00:33:08,848 --> 00:33:11,544
Madam Leela is waiting for you.

338
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:16,480
Have a drink. Enjoy.

339
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:47,670
The vision I saw in my
dreams, is ahead of me.

340
00:35:48,307 --> 00:35:59,137
That person I asked for in
my prayers, today I got it.

341
00:35:59,652 --> 00:36:04,848
All my wishes were fulfilled, my
fictitious story became true.

342
00:36:05,191 --> 00:36:11,052
My happiness has no limits.

343
00:36:11,352 --> 00:36:16,348
All my wishes were fulfilled, my
fictitious story became true.

344
00:36:16,601 --> 00:36:22,552
My happiness has no limits.

345
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:33,680
The sweet scent of his
body perfumes my breath.

346
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:39,289
Joyful and vivid beauty.

347
00:36:45,186 --> 00:36:50,900
Joyful and vivid beauty.

348
00:37:56,386 --> 00:37:57,200
Saajan?

349
00:38:02,074 --> 00:38:03,200
Where are you going?

350
00:38:04,376 --> 00:38:05,200
Mom..

351
00:38:05,845 --> 00:38:08,100
To a friend's party.

352
00:38:08,345 --> 00:38:10,238
- Come back soon, will you?
Yes.

353
00:38:11,617 --> 00:38:13,005
Mama pue ..

354
00:38:13,819 --> 00:38:16,188
- Can you give me some money?
- How much?

355
00:38:16,989 --> 00:38:19,100
Umm..100Rs will suffice.

356
00:38:19,602 --> 00:38:21,123
I have to..

357
00:38:21,602 --> 00:38:23,123
..to buy a gift.

358
00:38:25,898 --> 00:38:29,830
Do you want love or money?

359
00:38:33,205 --> 00:38:36,068
- Love, but I need the money.
- Taking.

360
00:38:36,905 --> 00:38:37,800
To a good time.

361
00:38:39,411 --> 00:38:40,200
Your?

362
00:38:41,313 --> 00:38:43,100
You were here a few
days ago, right?

363
00:38:43,649 --> 00:38:47,000
Madam Leela! I told him.

364
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:50,000
"Once you come here, you will
come back and come back."

365
00:38:50,422 --> 00:38:55,300
I can be small. But surely my
vision for the future is not.

366
00:38:55,928 --> 00:38:57,228
Did not I tell you, sir?

367
00:38:59,598 --> 00:39:00,766
Where will you go?

368
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:07,809
With Paro?

369
00:39:09,275 --> 00:39:10,243
Go.

370
00:39:49,615 --> 00:39:50,883
Your name is Paro?

371
00:39:55,821 --> 00:39:58,281
Your name is Paro, right?

372
00:39:59,925 --> 00:40:02,285
- Do not.
- Then what is?

373
00:40:03,295 --> 00:40:06,887
If your name is not Paro, what is it?

374
00:40:08,233 --> 00:40:11,200
- Why do you ask?
- Just because.

375
00:40:11,903 --> 00:40:14,839
If you do not know your name,
how will we know each other?

376
00:40:15,741 --> 00:40:18,100
No problem. I'll tell you first.

377
00:40:18,607 --> 00:40:19,706
My name is Saajan.

378
00:40:20,507 --> 00:40:21,606
Saajan Sood.

379
00:40:22,247 --> 00:40:25,000
- I'm a college student.
- You are a student?

380
00:40:25,284 --> 00:40:29,000
- Yeah, I'm freshman.
- What are your subjects?

381
00:40:29,621 --> 00:40:32,152
You... I mean, did you usually study?

382
00:40:35,021 --> 00:40:35,852
Sorry.

383
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:38,221
I do not want to say that

384
00:40:39,665 --> 00:40:41,467
Please do not be offended.

385
00:40:43,465 --> 00:40:44,767
I'm an idiot.

386
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:51,136
All right.

387
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:53,836
I'll come another time.

388
00:40:55,905 --> 00:40:56,736
Bye.

389
00:41:00,005 --> 00:41:01,236
Bye.

390
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:06,336
Bye.

391
00:41:18,905 --> 00:41:19,836
Hey Commander!

392
00:41:21,273 --> 00:41:24,472
You are here, and I look
everywhere for you, my friend.

393
00:41:25,505 --> 00:41:26,636
Hey Commander!

394
00:41:27,379 --> 00:41:30,900
- Idiot, any problem?
- No friend, none.

395
00:41:32,003 --> 00:41:35,100
- Any tension at home?
- No tension, never there.

396
00:41:35,921 --> 00:41:38,100
I understand!
It is a financial crisis.

397
00:41:39,324 --> 00:41:42,400
Do not worry friend.
My rich dad is back.

398
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:44,200
Receive as much as you want.

399
00:41:44,463 --> 00:41:47,000
I'll get a jeep for
my birthday, a jeep!

400
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,799
- When? On your 50th birthday?
- Hey, idiot!

401
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:54,298
- Come to my party, okay? Bye.
- Okay.

402
00:41:56,369 --> 00:41:57,298
Buddha?

403
00:41:58,210 --> 00:41:59,000
What friend?

404
00:41:59,445 --> 00:42:01,350
- Would you lend me 100Rs?
- 100Rs?

405
00:42:01,647 --> 00:42:04,600
Sorry, friend.
I can not lend you 100Rs.

406
00:42:04,903 --> 00:42:08,100
100Rs is so little, they all
forget that they borrowed them.

407
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:13,300
You know friend, how much I hate
to ask for the money I give.

408
00:42:13,526 --> 00:42:15,000
So, I give you 300Rs.

409
00:42:15,904 --> 00:42:18,200
And if you want to buy me a
gift, I can give you more!

410
00:42:18,504 --> 00:42:21,725
I sure want to buy a
gift..but not for you.

411
00:42:22,204 --> 00:42:23,125
It's for someone else.

412
00:42:26,504 --> 00:42:27,425
Hello!

413
00:42:29,075 --> 00:42:30,000
How are you?

414
00:42:30,275 --> 00:42:32,674
- I'm sending you Jaggu?
- Do not.

415
00:42:34,446 --> 00:42:35,377
I came on my own.

416
00:42:36,446 --> 00:42:37,677
Why did you come?

417
00:42:39,084 --> 00:42:40,343
I like it.

418
00:42:42,154 --> 00:42:44,300
- What do you like?
- Look at you.

419
00:42:45,323 --> 00:42:46,500
Meet me.

420
00:42:46,909 --> 00:42:50,300
- Is your house nearby?
- No, in Juhu (Mumbai)

421
00:42:50,563 --> 00:42:52,224
Where is Juhu?

422
00:42:53,565 --> 00:42:55,200
Do not you know where Juhu is?

423
00:42:56,068 --> 00:42:58,300
The beach near Santacruz
is called Juhu.

424
00:42:58,571 --> 00:43:00,300
Is your house near the beach?

425
00:43:00,506 --> 00:43:03,136
Amazing!
Have not you seen the beach yet, Paro?

426
00:43:04,576 --> 00:43:06,276
My name is not Paro.

427
00:43:07,179 --> 00:43:08,600
They gave me that name.

428
00:43:09,581 --> 00:43:11,240
If your name is not Paro, what is it?

429
00:43:12,581 --> 00:43:13,240
Kaajal.

430
00:43:13,581 --> 00:43:14,240
Kaajal?

431
00:43:14,501 --> 00:43:15,440
Shit!

432
00:43:15,821 --> 00:43:18,586
If you had told me before, I would
not have made this mistake.

433
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:22,300
- That mistake?
- I would not have brought this.

434
00:43:22,594 --> 00:43:24,494
For you would have brought
Kaajal (eyeliner)

435
00:43:24,964 --> 00:43:30,292
- I'm glad you did not.
- Why?

436
00:43:32,204 --> 00:43:33,602
It would not have been useful.

437
00:43:37,242 --> 00:43:39,302
You came here of your
own free will, Kaajal?

438
00:43:42,814 --> 00:43:43,715
How about?

439
00:43:44,814 --> 00:43:46,015
It is very beautiful.

440
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,382
Use it.

441
00:43:51,925 --> 00:43:52,982
Please.

442
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:10,482
Thank you.

443
00:44:11,643 --> 00:44:13,000
Why do you say thank you?

444
00:44:13,312 --> 00:44:16,180
- For accepting the gift.
- With a condition.

445
00:44:16,948 --> 00:44:21,142
The next time you come, do
not bring me any presents.

446
00:44:23,054 --> 00:44:25,079
Are you sure you'll come back?

447
00:44:28,454 --> 00:44:29,379
Kaajal?

448
00:44:30,195 --> 00:44:33,126
Can I come back .. to see you again?

449
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,593
Returns.

450
00:44:37,836 --> 00:44:41,500
Returns! Returns! For sure come back!

451
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,400
That's all you guys.
Girls tell you ..

452
00:44:44,676 --> 00:44:48,400
... to every man who comes
to the brothel Dhanraj.

453
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,900
Returns! Returns!

454
00:44:51,283 --> 00:44:53,584
But do not run away with our girls.

455
00:44:55,487 --> 00:44:59,090
Today this guy tried to
run away with this girl.

456
00:45:00,692 --> 00:45:06,200
Another more can do it soon.
And what will your pimps have?

457
00:45:07,365 --> 00:45:09,133
Just think! Think! Think!

458
00:45:09,701 --> 00:45:13,193
One by one, if our girls ..

459
00:45:14,305 --> 00:45:15,400
Female dog!

460
00:45:15,874 --> 00:45:18,000
If they run away with their lovers.

461
00:45:20,378 --> 00:45:22,303
Who will you force to
enter the business?

462
00:45:22,714 --> 00:45:25,500
Will you put your offer?

463
00:45:26,217 --> 00:45:28,100
No one will give you a penny!

464
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:33,248
Stop looking at my eyes
and look at my shoes.

465
00:45:42,434 --> 00:45:47,138
This idiot ran away with our girl.

466
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,200
Did you think you'd
escape our clutches?

467
00:45:51,543 --> 00:45:53,400
You could? Hey?! You could?!

468
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:57,100
Son, this world is
very big and long.

469
00:45:57,349 --> 00:46:01,108
But Dhanraj's hands are longer.

470
00:46:04,089 --> 00:46:05,800
Hey, lover boy!

471
00:46:06,091 --> 00:46:10,000
Girls like that are just for fun ..
for nothing else.

472
00:46:11,096 --> 00:46:15,800
What do you think? That you thought?
That Dhanraj opened this brothel ..

473
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,700
..to Romeos like you
come and marry my girls?

474
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,700
I run a brothel, not
a marriage agency!

475
00:46:23,541 --> 00:46:26,000
Female dog! If you die

476
00:46:26,278 --> 00:46:29,500
That will stop the other
girls from wanting to go.

477
00:46:30,002 --> 00:46:31,600
And my business will not suffer.

478
00:46:31,983 --> 00:46:35,014
You will die! Yes, you will! Give to me!

479
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,200
Take off your gag.

480
00:46:58,443 --> 00:47:03,004
So every lover who comes
here, can hear their cries!

481
00:47:03,243 --> 00:47:04,174
Dhanraj!

482
00:47:09,154 --> 00:47:11,315
Unfortunate!

483
00:47:12,257 --> 00:47:15,300
Rascal! We cursed you!

484
00:47:16,408 --> 00:47:18,920
May you die at the hands of a lover!

485
00:47:24,536 --> 00:47:26,534
Lovers, my ass!

486
00:47:32,736 --> 00:47:33,500
Oh God!

487
00:47:33,709 --> 00:47:38,746
- What? What happened, sir?
- What did the world become?

488
00:47:40,418 --> 00:47:42,600
A girl was burned in the
middle of the road ..

489
00:47:42,854 --> 00:47:45,000
.. after being rose with gasoline.

490
00:47:45,257 --> 00:47:47,500
- Oh God!
- Look, this is the picture of the girl.

491
00:47:48,193 --> 00:47:50,900
She certainly did not even
know what the world was.

492
00:47:51,263 --> 00:47:54,200
The second case in 6 months.
There was a similar case before.

493
00:47:54,466 --> 00:47:58,400
Sir, the funeral pyre of whoever
did this, it burned soon.

494
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:00,600
Do you want me to bring you tea?

495
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:04,070
Yes, and listen, send
yourself to the madam above.

496
00:48:04,876 --> 00:48:06,200
Hey soldier!

497
00:48:07,378 --> 00:48:10,177
- A no, two cups of tea!
- Officer!

498
00:48:10,378 --> 00:48:11,800
Friend! You are welcome! You are welcome!

499
00:48:12,007 --> 00:48:14,100
- A lot of time has passed.
- Just passing by ..

500
00:48:14,386 --> 00:48:16,000
..and thought about visiting.

501
00:48:16,621 --> 00:48:18,100
Soldier, do it for the police.

502
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:21,600
Must be first class.
Tell me Colonel.

503
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,600
- Like this sister-in-law and Saajan?
- Both good.

504
00:48:23,895 --> 00:48:26,100
- But I'm in a bad mood.
- Why?

505
00:48:26,398 --> 00:48:29,100
- Because of your fault.
- Mia? Why?

506
00:48:29,301 --> 00:48:31,500
- You read about this girl?
Yes.

507
00:48:31,703 --> 00:48:33,700
What a police commissioner you are!
Do something.

508
00:48:34,072 --> 00:48:38,100
Colonel, I can do
many things but ..

509
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:41,100
... of all these
crimes is Dhanraj.

510
00:48:41,613 --> 00:48:44,100
- Dhanraj?
- He's a very big gangster.

511
00:48:44,515 --> 00:48:47,900
He has brothels all over town.

512
00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:53,200
He catches and kidnaps girls, and
forces them to treat people.

513
00:48:53,525 --> 00:48:55,800
That sirvenguenza has a vast
and flourishing business.

514
00:48:56,328 --> 00:48:59,100
But Colonel, the most
disappointing thing is that ..

515
00:48:59,331 --> 00:49:02,000
.. we have no
evidence against it.

516
00:49:02,434 --> 00:49:06,237
Because not just thugs, there
are many cops involved with it.

517
00:49:06,534 --> 00:49:07,637
Oh I see. Yes.

518
00:49:07,973 --> 00:49:10,200
- Not just thugs, cops too.
Yes.

519
00:49:10,702 --> 00:49:12,602
- Then there is only one solution.
- Which?

520
00:49:12,902 --> 00:49:16,342
The army in charge, shoot him
and kill the damn bastard.

521
00:49:16,808 --> 00:49:20,147
No Colonel. There is no need
for the army in charge.

522
00:49:44,075 --> 00:49:47,673
Look, sir. You will not find another
girl like that around here.

523
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,000
I like it! I like it!

524
00:49:50,482 --> 00:49:52,141
Pure, sir, pure!

525
00:49:55,987 --> 00:49:58,315
Send you something to eat, sir?

526
00:49:59,991 --> 00:50:01,789
There is no need for that.

527
00:50:02,994 --> 00:50:04,162
Virgin!

528
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:22,200
What trap did you put me in ?!
This girl is absolutely crazy!

529
00:50:22,414 --> 00:50:26,800
Not a word, and she
hit me with a bottle!

530
00:50:27,018 --> 00:50:28,900
What happened, sir? Sir, what happened?

531
00:50:29,187 --> 00:50:34,300
If she does not know how to do anything,
why are you sending me with her?

532
00:50:34,526 --> 00:50:38,300
- Tell me, rogue!
- No, sir, the girl is not crazy!

533
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:40,828
But since she arrived,
she has driven us crazy.

534
00:50:42,734 --> 00:50:46,200
I will teach you a lesson today!

535
00:50:46,438 --> 00:50:48,639
I will straighten it, I will
not let it do what I want!

536
00:50:50,001 --> 00:50:51,866
Trying to make you alive?

537
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,200
- Will you agree or not?
- What are you doing?

538
00:50:57,449 --> 00:51:00,543
- You gonna kill her?
- Yeah, I'll kill her!

539
00:51:01,352 --> 00:51:04,681
Trying to make herself alive, this
bitch is ruining my business!

540
00:51:05,556 --> 00:51:09,156
Today she scare away
a regular customer!

541
00:51:11,062 --> 00:51:12,800
She is ruining our business!
The damn bitch!

542
00:51:13,064 --> 00:51:14,400
Who does he think he is?

543
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:18,800
Jaggu! Jaggu! Calm down!
Calm down! Everything will be fine!

544
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:21,300
Everything will be all right, eh?
When Dhanraj ..

545
00:51:21,573 --> 00:51:24,100
.. come and get the
money, you will answer?

546
00:51:24,376 --> 00:51:27,177
Yes, I will respond.

547
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:29,277
I will respond.

548
00:51:31,082 --> 00:51:35,082
Think Leela, think about it. Your love
for her will end up being expensive.

549
00:51:36,488 --> 00:51:38,079
Love is expensive, Jaggu.

550
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:42,191
But for those who
know love it is not.

551
00:51:47,608 --> 00:51:50,095
Do not cry, daughter. Do not Cry.

552
00:51:51,102 --> 00:51:52,700
If there was power in the tears ..

553
00:51:53,306 --> 00:51:56,137
This brothel would
have sunk long ago.

554
00:52:11,606 --> 00:52:12,437
Hello!

555
00:52:13,458 --> 00:52:14,726
Are you sleeping?

556
00:52:16,518 --> 00:52:17,626
Kaajal?

557
00:52:18,529 --> 00:52:19,700
You are asleep

558
00:52:20,698 --> 00:52:21,895
Look, I came back.

559
00:52:22,698 --> 00:52:23,495
Hello?

560
00:52:24,518 --> 00:52:25,600
Kaajal?

561
00:52:25,918 --> 00:52:27,426
Kaajal?

562
00:52:28,018 --> 00:52:28,926
What?

563
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:32,426
Oh my goodness!

564
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,500
Jaggu hit you again?

565
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,278
No one beats that way
even to an animal. Shit!

566
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:42,200
What kind of man is he?
I will break your bones!

567
00:52:42,754 --> 00:52:45,300
- That is useless.
- What do you mean?

568
00:52:45,657 --> 00:52:48,449
I consider this to
be my destiny now.

569
00:52:50,161 --> 00:52:51,300
It seems..

570
00:52:52,564 --> 00:52:53,800
What are you beating

571
00:52:54,666 --> 00:53:02,301
This humiliation and this
dark room is my destiny.

572
00:53:04,509 --> 00:53:07,200
Do not! This is not your fate Kaajal!

573
00:53:07,579 --> 00:53:11,279
This dark room, this humiliation
is not your destiny.

574
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:15,900
Outside this dark room,
there is a huge world.

575
00:53:16,187 --> 00:53:19,300
Which is very beautiful...
which is your destination.

576
00:53:19,524 --> 00:53:21,900
Yes, which is your destiny.

577
00:53:22,193 --> 00:53:27,295
I have seen nothing but
these four walls, Saajan.

578
00:53:28,533 --> 00:53:29,592
Let's go now.

579
00:53:31,202 --> 00:53:34,600
But Saajan, they
will not let us go.

580
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,700
"I'll live to Jaggu alive."
- Do not tell him anything.

581
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:42,411
Just ask Madam Leela.

582
00:53:44,182 --> 00:53:45,108
Madam Leela.

583
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:50,400
Madam Leela. I..

584
00:53:50,822 --> 00:53:54,000
- I want to go out with Paro.
- You want to run away with her?

585
00:53:54,602 --> 00:53:57,125
No, I just want to walk with her.

586
00:53:58,329 --> 00:53:59,800
Walk outside with her! Moron!

587
00:54:00,429 --> 00:54:02,600
Boy, do not do anything wrong.

588
00:54:03,234 --> 00:54:06,500
If anything happens to him, Dhanraj
will not have mercy on you.

589
00:54:06,838 --> 00:54:09,564
- Not me..
- Forget the boss, Madam Leela.

590
00:54:10,241 --> 00:54:12,674
For the... I am enough.

591
00:54:13,641 --> 00:54:16,574
I can with 10 guys like him.

592
00:54:19,517 --> 00:54:23,146
Look Madam Leela, I'll
just take Paro for a ride.

593
00:54:24,602 --> 00:54:28,400
Hey! Do you dare look at me?
Do you think you're a real idiot ?!

594
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,600
- Come on, go.
"Madam, tell him not to touch me!"

595
00:54:30,862 --> 00:54:36,162
Jaggu, he wants to take Paro's ride.
Leave it alone.

596
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:43,767
If you say so Madam Leela.
Come on .. give me money. Come on.

597
00:54:44,976 --> 00:54:45,900
Money?

598
00:54:47,278 --> 00:54:51,881
Where you come from? Do you think she
will be free? Give me 2000Rs. Come on!

599
00:54:53,217 --> 00:54:54,844
- 2000Rs?
- What happens?

600
00:54:55,586 --> 00:54:57,100
Do you leave the idea of the ride?

601
00:54:57,489 --> 00:55:00,200
No. I do not have 2000Rs now.

602
00:55:01,292 --> 00:55:03,000
- I have to make the arrangements.
- Yes, good.

603
00:55:03,694 --> 00:55:05,385
Come back when you've done it.

604
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,210
Come on, go.

605
00:55:10,101 --> 00:55:14,861
Madam Leela, take care of Paro.

606
00:55:29,401 --> 00:55:30,361
Saajan?

607
00:55:43,134 --> 00:55:45,225
You got 200Rs out of my wallet?

608
00:55:45,637 --> 00:55:47,295
- Yes sir.
- Why?

609
00:55:48,673 --> 00:55:51,242
- It was an emergency, sir.
- What emergency?

610
00:55:52,443 --> 00:55:55,700
- Why did you steal it?
- Saajan? Why do not you talk?

611
00:55:55,943 --> 00:55:57,245
Why did you take the money?

612
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,941
- Why did you steal it?
- Enough! For the love of God!

613
00:56:02,353 --> 00:56:04,200
It must have been an emergency.

614
00:56:04,589 --> 00:56:06,300
Otherwise, he has never
done this before.

615
00:56:06,591 --> 00:56:08,200
I know what the emergency was!

616
00:56:08,827 --> 00:56:12,500
He wanted money for his vices!
So he started to steal!

617
00:56:12,864 --> 00:56:14,800
But Colonel Sood's son
could never be a corrupt!

618
00:56:15,064 --> 00:56:16,223
I will not tolerate it!

619
00:56:16,501 --> 00:56:18,200
If you give the one rupee ..

620
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:20,100
... you will face my anger.
Can you hear me?!

621
00:56:20,371 --> 00:56:24,271
From now on, he will not be given
an allowance! You understand?

622
00:56:24,709 --> 00:56:26,939
Come on. It's enough. Come on.

623
00:56:27,309 --> 00:56:28,439
Go away!

624
00:56:42,026 --> 00:56:46,200
I have seen nothing but
these four walls, Saajan.

625
00:56:48,398 --> 00:56:49,500
Where you come from?

626
00:56:50,201 --> 00:56:53,000
Do you think she will be free?
Give me 2000Rs. Come on.

627
00:56:53,404 --> 00:56:54,900
If you give the one rupee ..

628
00:56:55,273 --> 00:56:56,700
... you will face my anger.
Can you hear me?!

629
00:56:57,008 --> 00:57:00,108
From now on, he will not be given
an allowance! You understand?

630
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:38,700
Curse! Curse! Curse!

631
00:57:41,285 --> 00:57:43,200
- Driver, stop the car.
- Here?

632
00:57:43,955 --> 00:57:45,746
This is our Colonel's house.

633
00:57:46,657 --> 00:57:48,691
- How much is it?
- 30.75Rs.

634
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:50,991
Thank you.

635
00:57:57,457 --> 00:57:58,491
Saajan?

636
00:58:18,489 --> 00:58:19,547
Uncle Abdul.

637
00:58:26,731 --> 00:58:35,496
I'm sitting waiting

638
00:58:37,041 --> 00:58:43,210
.. with my hopes up.

639
00:58:44,916 --> 00:58:52,113
I do not know what time

640
00:58:53,524 --> 00:59:01,232
.. my beloved.

641
00:59:08,873 --> 00:59:15,236
Beloved, oh beloved, come now.

642
00:59:15,603 --> 00:59:22,106
Beloved, oh beloved, come now.

643
00:59:22,553 --> 00:59:28,549
I'm looking at your way.

644
00:59:29,153 --> 00:59:32,249
I'm looking at your way.

645
00:59:32,563 --> 00:59:35,529
Come, and let me see you.

646
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:42,236
Beloved, oh beloved, come now.

647
00:59:42,603 --> 00:59:49,306
Beloved, oh beloved, come now.

648
01:00:06,731 --> 01:00:13,200
I burn like a candle.

649
01:00:13,531 --> 01:00:19,394
I burn like a candle.

650
01:00:19,944 --> 01:00:26,312
I melt like candle wax.

651
01:00:30,231 --> 01:00:36,194
I burn like a flame.

652
01:00:36,704 --> 01:00:42,912
I melt like candle wax.

653
01:00:45,604 --> 01:00:52,842
Day and night, on the
walls I write your name.

654
01:00:53,144 --> 01:00:56,300
Do not stifle me and die.

655
01:00:56,548 --> 01:00:59,700
Come and give hope to my heart.

656
01:00:59,851 --> 01:01:06,200
Beloved, oh beloved, come now.

657
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:13,009
Beloved, oh beloved, come now.

658
01:01:28,012 --> 01:01:29,100
Uncle Abdul!

659
01:01:30,181 --> 01:01:31,000
Uncle Abdul!

660
01:01:31,281 --> 01:01:32,048
Saajan?

661
01:01:33,684 --> 01:01:36,175
I do not understand your drama.

662
01:01:36,687 --> 01:01:38,400
Are you a man or a ghost?

663
01:01:38,689 --> 01:01:41,000
You drive a taxi all night, and
you go to university by day.

664
01:01:41,292 --> 01:01:44,400
How long will this be?
If the Colonel finds out ..

665
01:01:44,605 --> 01:01:46,900
.. did not even care
that I was his driver.

666
01:01:47,198 --> 01:01:50,100
And get me out of town.
Why all this drama?

667
01:01:50,402 --> 01:01:52,100
Do not ask, Uncle Abdul. "

668
01:01:52,503 --> 01:01:55,200
He who falls into this
drama will go mad.

669
01:01:55,873 --> 01:01:59,000
So much money? Did you put
your hand in someone's pocket?

670
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:03,000
It's my money won
with a lot of effort.

671
01:02:03,214 --> 01:02:05,900
But what is your
need, Lord Saajan?

672
01:02:06,117 --> 01:02:10,000
The need for Saajan does not, the
girlfriend of Saajan needs it.

673
01:02:13,057 --> 01:02:14,000
Mr. Colonel.

674
01:02:14,225 --> 01:02:17,900
Saajan is totally absent from
university in the last time.

675
01:02:18,129 --> 01:02:21,600
We are here to find out why.

676
01:02:21,899 --> 01:02:25,500
Sir, he does not concentrate
on his studies.

677
01:02:25,736 --> 01:02:28,638
You must tell him that
all this is not good.

678
01:02:31,742 --> 01:02:33,400
Guys, they scared me!

679
01:02:33,811 --> 01:02:37,500
We came with the intention
of telling you everything.

680
01:02:37,748 --> 01:02:41,000
... and submit to you
to court martial.

681
01:02:41,252 --> 01:02:45,053
- You're lucky he is not.
- Thank God!

682
01:02:45,355 --> 01:02:51,500
Come on, begin. Tell us
everything in detail.

683
01:02:51,762 --> 01:02:54,000
- Come on, tell us.
- About what?

684
01:02:55,265 --> 01:02:59,300
Your reason for not going to college.
Come on baby, say it all at once.

685
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:03,100
- Nothing, guys. Was occupied.
- Listen, son.

686
01:03:03,374 --> 01:03:05,500
I have more experience than you

687
01:03:05,776 --> 01:03:08,200
I have had 35 romances and
romance 36 is in process.

688
01:03:08,446 --> 01:03:11,900
- This is a symptom of "Amorsitis".
- Hey! Is your mind okay?

689
01:03:12,116 --> 01:03:15,000
Do not hide it. Dinos, who is she?

690
01:03:15,286 --> 01:03:17,000
- Is it from our university?
- Is it from your neighborhood?

691
01:03:17,288 --> 01:03:19,000
- Did you meet on the way?
- Or in a hotel?

692
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:22,900
- You came to talk about this?
- No friend.

693
01:03:23,194 --> 01:03:24,200
We came to remind you of something important.

694
01:03:24,594 --> 01:03:27,000
- Today is Buddha's birthday.
- Oh friends!

695
01:03:27,298 --> 01:03:29,600
There will be a party, and if you do not come ..

696
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,300
..we will see what we have been rehearsing.

697
01:03:31,569 --> 01:03:35,100
Which means, that we will complain
to the Colonel about you.

698
01:03:35,806 --> 01:03:39,000
Hey, tell Buddha that
today I can not friends.

699
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:42,100
No, look, the party is
today, and you have to come.

700
01:03:42,446 --> 01:03:45,600
Take her if you want.
It's just our group.

701
01:03:45,883 --> 01:03:48,143
- You will come, right?
- Sure, huh?

702
01:03:50,821 --> 01:03:51,700
I will go.

703
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:55,600
Unemployment! Unemployment! Unemployment! He came!

704
01:03:55,893 --> 01:04:00,125
Unemployment! Unemployment! Unemployment! He came!

705
01:04:14,645 --> 01:04:17,200
And listen. Remember this.

706
01:04:18,315 --> 01:04:23,000
If you try to seduce the girl,
or you think about running ..

707
01:04:23,553 --> 01:04:26,100
I'll bury you alive! Got it?
Now get out!

708
01:04:26,457 --> 01:04:30,200
Jaggu, the boy seems to be
from a respectable family.

709
01:04:30,528 --> 01:04:32,296
He would not retract his words.

710
01:04:32,963 --> 01:04:36,531
Go, take her. But bring it in time.

711
01:05:16,974 --> 01:05:19,843
How do you feel?

712
01:05:20,244 --> 01:05:23,205
It feels good.

713
01:05:23,914 --> 01:05:26,574
The dream of love ..

714
01:05:27,084 --> 01:05:30,002
.. now it seems true.

715
01:05:30,604 --> 01:05:33,143
How do you feel?

716
01:05:34,144 --> 01:05:36,505
It feels good.

717
01:05:37,514 --> 01:05:40,074
The dream of love ..

718
01:05:40,704 --> 01:05:43,002
.. now it seems true.

719
01:05:43,634 --> 01:05:46,594
When you are near me

720
01:05:46,904 --> 01:05:50,004
.. you are my good luck.

721
01:05:50,274 --> 01:05:53,235
You reside in my heart.

722
01:05:53,944 --> 01:05:57,503
You are my happiness.

723
01:05:57,805 --> 01:06:01,000
Without you, I do not want
to live a single moment.

724
01:06:01,252 --> 01:06:03,812
How do you feel?

725
01:06:04,421 --> 01:06:07,152
It feels good.

726
01:06:07,958 --> 01:06:10,957
The dream of love ..

727
01:06:11,362 --> 01:06:13,900
.. now it seems true.

728
01:06:14,131 --> 01:06:17,059
When you are near me

729
01:06:17,368 --> 01:06:20,194
.. you are my good luck.

730
01:06:20,704 --> 01:06:23,800
You are my happiness.

731
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:27,575
You reside in my heart.

732
01:06:28,178 --> 01:06:31,400
Without you, I do not want
to live a single moment.

733
01:06:31,608 --> 01:06:33,970
How do you feel?

734
01:06:34,608 --> 01:06:37,270
It feels good.

735
01:06:38,178 --> 01:06:40,570
The dream of love ..

736
01:06:41,678 --> 01:06:45,270
.. now it seems true.

737
01:07:18,729 --> 01:07:24,264
In every direction there is
an atmosphere of happiness.

738
01:07:25,369 --> 01:07:31,575
I have seen this world
for the first time.

739
01:07:39,009 --> 01:07:45,664
In each direction there is
an atmosphere of happiness.

740
01:07:45,969 --> 01:07:52,075
I have seen this world
for the first time.

741
01:07:52,396 --> 01:07:59,000
We have come out of the world of sadness.

742
01:07:59,236 --> 01:08:05,801
The shadows of pain
are far from us.

743
01:08:06,076 --> 01:08:09,177
Let's pray because ..

744
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:12,800
Whatever happens now, we
never have to endure pain.

745
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,600
How do you feel?

746
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,021
It feels good.

747
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,751
The dream of love ..

748
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,041
.. now it seems true.

749
01:08:56,603 --> 01:09:03,094
Never break the promises of love.

750
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:09,738
Do not ever leave me alone.

751
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:23,094
Never break the promises of love.

752
01:09:23,650 --> 01:09:29,538
Do not ever leave me alone.

753
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:37,059
I will not be able to drink tears.

754
01:09:37,367 --> 01:09:43,708
I will not be able to
live apart from you.

755
01:09:43,974 --> 01:09:47,100
Let's make the promise that ..

756
01:09:47,378 --> 01:09:50,500
.. we will always
agree on each other.

757
01:09:50,781 --> 01:09:53,900
How do you feel?

758
01:09:54,184 --> 01:09:57,100
It feels good.

759
01:09:57,521 --> 01:10:00,300
The dream of love ..

760
01:10:00,724 --> 01:10:03,200
.. now it seems true.

761
01:10:03,594 --> 01:10:06,500
When you are near me

762
01:10:06,797 --> 01:10:10,000
.. you are my good luck.

763
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,500
You reside in my heart.

764
01:10:13,737 --> 01:10:17,300
You are my happiness.

765
01:10:17,541 --> 01:10:20,800
Without you, I do not want
to live a single moment.

766
01:10:21,078 --> 01:10:24,000
How do you feel?

767
01:10:24,414 --> 01:10:27,400
It feels good.

768
01:10:27,618 --> 01:10:30,900
The dream of love ..

769
01:10:31,288 --> 01:10:35,000
.. now it seems true.

770
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:24,400
- Hey, Commander!
- Hi cute!

771
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,000
- Hello.
- Hello!

772
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:28,200
Hey Commander!

773
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:30,100
Hey Buddha!

774
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:32,400
- Happy Birthday!
- Thank you!

775
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:36,000
It's good that you came, or I was going
to send Refill with your father.

776
01:11:36,285 --> 01:11:38,600
Why my friend? Oh yeah! By
the way, she is Kaajal.

777
01:11:40,037 --> 01:11:41,400
Oh, so you're Kaajal ?!

778
01:11:41,601 --> 01:11:45,000
Come on! What are you waiting? Come and
get my blessings. Come on! Come on!

779
01:11:45,405 --> 01:11:48,130
- Yes, you must.
- Yes Yes Yes..

780
01:11:49,435 --> 01:11:51,230
No no! Just kidding.

781
01:11:51,535 --> 01:11:53,530
Hey Tempo, Refill, come friends!

782
01:11:54,535 --> 01:11:56,230
- Hello Baby!
- Refill!

783
01:11:57,535 --> 01:11:58,430
Hello!

784
01:11:59,243 --> 01:12:01,500
- Did you eat something?
- No thanks. It will be less for you.

785
01:12:02,913 --> 01:12:06,200
Kaajal, this is my party, and
the night belongs to us.

786
01:12:06,413 --> 01:12:09,249
- So, enjoy!
- Yes !!

787
01:12:14,324 --> 01:12:15,500
How cute!

788
01:13:10,014 --> 01:13:15,215
Sorry, there is also a candidate here,
Your Highness, if your Highness.

789
01:13:21,224 --> 01:13:24,200
- She does not want to dance with you.
- Why not?

790
01:13:24,495 --> 01:13:27,500
- Why not? What would be the damage?
- Mahesh, come on, mate.

791
01:13:27,798 --> 01:13:29,500
Your wife is with
you, dance with her.

792
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:33,109
- Hey Kitty, take care of him, come on.
- Hey Kitty, leave me, let go.

793
01:13:33,703 --> 01:13:36,000
It is with her that I am going to dance.

794
01:13:36,406 --> 01:13:38,400
Mahesh! You're drunk! Long!

795
01:13:38,609 --> 01:13:40,300
Do not you dare threaten me.

796
01:13:40,677 --> 01:13:46,000
You bring a prostitute to our
party and you threaten me ?!

797
01:13:46,916 --> 01:13:47,607
- What?
- Yeah!

798
01:13:54,424 --> 01:13:55,600
What do you say friend

799
01:13:55,826 --> 01:13:57,700
Mahesh, why are you ruining
the Buddha's feast?

800
01:13:57,928 --> 01:13:59,100
The idiot is calling
her a prostitute!

801
01:13:59,763 --> 01:14:03,700
This idiot is ruining the party
by bringing in a prostitute!

802
01:14:04,134 --> 01:14:06,294
If you say another word, I will kill you!

803
01:14:06,634 --> 01:14:07,494
Saajan!

804
01:14:11,173 --> 01:14:13,200
Everyone knows she's a
fucking prostitute!

805
01:14:13,443 --> 01:14:16,300
She is a prostitute.
Ask him where he comes from!

806
01:14:16,846 --> 01:14:19,000
- Saajan! Why do not you say something?
- Who is she, my friend?

807
01:14:19,449 --> 01:14:22,200
I'll tell you! This
damn prostitute ..

808
01:14:22,453 --> 01:14:27,085
.. comes from Forras Road. Say it!
Say it! I am right?

809
01:14:38,468 --> 01:14:42,300
Yes, she comes from Forras road. Yes,
she lives in the brothel of Dhanraj.

810
01:14:42,873 --> 01:14:44,100
But she is not a prostitute!

811
01:14:44,507 --> 01:14:49,000
She is as innocent as
any of her sisters.

812
01:14:49,479 --> 01:14:52,100
They do not believe it, right?

813
01:14:52,482 --> 01:14:54,600
That a girl who lives in
a brothel can be pure ?!

814
01:14:55,085 --> 01:14:57,200
Tell me! Do not believe?!

815
01:14:57,988 --> 01:15:02,900
Want a test? Hey? Want a test?

816
01:15:03,393 --> 01:15:05,785
Here is the proof!
Here is the proof!

817
01:15:07,764 --> 01:15:11,600
Look at these marks. They
are proof of your honesty!

818
01:15:11,902 --> 01:15:16,567
Of his dignity, his defenselessness
and his virginity!

819
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:22,700
Even everyone wants
to know who she is?

820
01:15:23,212 --> 01:15:26,200
Where does it come from? Ask me!
Ask me now!

821
01:15:26,716 --> 01:15:30,212
Answer! Why are they all so quiet?
Answer!

822
01:15:30,622 --> 01:15:32,200
Nobody wants to ask anything?

823
01:15:32,522 --> 01:15:33,800
Nobody wants to ask anything?

824
01:15:34,124 --> 01:15:36,200
But I want to ask this
respectable man ..

825
01:15:36,727 --> 01:15:41,724
.. why are you going to Forras
road despite having a wife?

826
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,268
Answer me, you bastard!

827
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:48,208
Friend!

828
01:15:48,538 --> 01:15:50,529
This guy mistreats my Kaajal!

829
01:15:51,541 --> 01:15:54,700
She is my life! If you say
something against her ..

830
01:15:54,945 --> 01:15:57,636
..I'll kill you! Remember it!

831
01:15:58,548 --> 01:16:00,000
Saajan, relax.

832
01:16:00,884 --> 01:16:03,300
Take me back, Saajan.

833
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,450
Take me back, come on.

834
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:07,999
Let go.

835
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:12,209
Kaajal.

836
01:16:13,002 --> 01:16:15,053
It is useless to cry
and feel ashamed.

837
01:16:15,465 --> 01:16:17,463
You are above these people.

838
01:16:19,869 --> 01:16:21,037
Come with me.

839
01:16:31,369 --> 01:16:33,037
Honey, calm down.

840
01:16:36,169 --> 01:16:37,077
Kaajal?

841
01:16:37,387 --> 01:16:38,628
You are angry with me?

842
01:16:38,997 --> 01:16:41,088
- Do not.
- So?

843
01:16:42,592 --> 01:16:45,000
So you're scared of these people
who are not worth anything?

844
01:16:45,262 --> 01:16:48,900
That they have nothing but a heart,
a mind that is worth nothing?

845
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:52,328
Nothing! Only loud voices!

846
01:16:54,604 --> 01:16:57,400
To scream and mistreat!

847
01:16:57,907 --> 01:17:03,045
But they can not support anyone!
They can not encourage anyone.

848
01:17:03,613 --> 01:17:05,300
They can not help anyone!

849
01:17:05,782 --> 01:17:09,013
Those who are like Mahesh
should not fear them, Kaajal.

850
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:14,800
They are like those stray
dogs that bark at everyone.

851
01:17:15,025 --> 01:17:17,800
Why fear them? You
should not even bother!

852
01:17:18,028 --> 01:17:21,900
I do not fear them, I fear
for your reputation, Saajan.

853
01:17:22,132 --> 01:17:24,862
They will defame you.

854
01:17:26,736 --> 01:17:28,900
I was afraid of being defamed ..

855
01:17:29,139 --> 01:17:31,400
..the day I step on the
brothel of Dhanraj.

856
01:17:31,975 --> 01:17:33,500
But after meeting you ..

857
01:17:34,010 --> 01:17:37,271
.. overcome my fears, overcome everything.

858
01:17:37,647 --> 01:17:38,800
Except one.

859
01:17:39,049 --> 01:17:41,500
My dream of being one with
you can not be shattered.

860
01:17:41,718 --> 01:17:45,279
There is a big difference between
dreams and reality, Saajan.

861
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:49,200
And the fact is, between you and me ..

862
01:17:49,659 --> 01:17:53,220
..is Madam Leela,
Jaggu and Dhanraj.

863
01:17:55,665 --> 01:17:58,800
When a girl can leave her
house and come here ..

864
01:17:59,069 --> 01:18:02,561
... neither Leela, nor Jaggu,
nor even Dhanraj can stop it.

865
01:18:03,239 --> 01:18:07,308
The doors of a house and those of
a prison are different, Saajan.

866
01:18:07,677 --> 01:18:09,900
The former open with
the desire of oneself.

867
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:12,239
The second, with the
consent of the jailer.

868
01:18:13,082 --> 01:18:16,912
First tell me your wish.
I'll take care of the rest.

869
01:18:17,954 --> 01:18:20,184
Is that what I should say?

870
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:21,900
Do not.

871
01:18:22,692 --> 01:18:25,593
But tell me something.

872
01:18:27,697 --> 01:18:29,631
How did you fall into his trap?

873
01:18:36,999 --> 01:18:37,831
Saajan.

874
01:18:38,708 --> 01:18:42,200
It all seems like a nightmare to me.

875
01:18:43,613 --> 01:18:44,500
I wonder..

876
01:18:46,415 --> 01:18:47,900
..if what I am going to say ..

877
01:18:48,717 --> 01:18:50,400
..you can listen.

878
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:56,488
But it is true.
It is my personal experience.

879
01:19:01,731 --> 01:19:04,400
A mountain station.

880
01:19:04,669 --> 01:19:08,400
A deep valley.

881
01:19:08,638 --> 01:19:11,600
A small house.

882
01:19:12,241 --> 01:19:14,309
My grandfather, my grandmother.

883
01:19:14,744 --> 01:19:16,900
Those who took care of
me when my mother died.

884
01:19:17,147 --> 01:19:21,600
And my father, he was a
very good person, Saajan.

885
01:19:21,918 --> 01:19:23,900
He was a teacher in a school.

886
01:19:24,154 --> 01:19:28,300
But all good things come to an end.
He died.

887
01:19:28,758 --> 01:19:33,500
One day he went to school...
and he never came back.

888
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:38,400
When the breadwinner dies,
Saajan, also the family.

889
01:19:39,068 --> 01:19:42,100
How could we manage the house with
our grandfather's little pension?

890
01:19:42,572 --> 01:19:45,500
We started to live with just money.
So I decided

891
01:19:45,975 --> 01:19:50,178
.. take my father's place.
To work.

892
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:54,600
Send requests to many places.

893
01:19:54,851 --> 01:19:58,700
I also received many calls.
But I had no money for the ticket.

894
01:19:59,122 --> 01:20:01,700
I received a call from a Mumbai
company for an interview.

895
01:20:02,192 --> 01:20:04,000
They sent me the
money to travel.

896
01:20:04,294 --> 01:20:07,889
I felt that God had
answered my prayers.

897
01:20:09,532 --> 01:20:12,100
I arrived in Mumbai and went to the place ..

898
01:20:12,502 --> 01:20:14,800
Where he was supposed
to have the interview.

899
01:20:15,504 --> 01:20:17,700
There were many interviewers.

900
01:20:18,308 --> 01:20:23,100
They checked my application
and asked me many questions.

901
01:20:23,513 --> 01:20:27,000
Who were my relatives,
where my village was.

902
01:20:27,517 --> 01:20:29,747
I told them everything.

903
01:20:31,254 --> 01:20:35,884
They gave me 1,000Rs of
advance to send home.

904
01:20:39,696 --> 01:20:44,600
The man who saw me met
me outside the post.

905
01:20:45,501 --> 01:20:47,300
He offered me a ride.

906
01:20:48,941 --> 01:20:50,500
I sit in the car.

907
01:20:51,374 --> 01:20:56,744
Without realizing where
I would end this trip.

908
01:20:57,847 --> 01:21:00,500
I found myself in the
brothel of Dhanraj.

909
01:21:00,917 --> 01:21:04,681
Try to get away from that place.

910
01:21:06,589 --> 01:21:09,249
But it was in vain.

911
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:14,190
So I decided to end my life.

912
01:21:16,132 --> 01:21:19,060
And suddenly... you entered.

913
01:21:21,204 --> 01:21:24,565
I saw a ray of hope in your eyes.

914
01:21:28,211 --> 01:21:32,100
I want to live, Saajan. I want to live.

915
01:21:32,582 --> 01:21:37,979
But not in that brothel,
not in that darkness.

916
01:21:39,622 --> 01:21:45,322
I want to live, Saajan. I want to live.

917
01:22:15,625 --> 01:22:17,700
The darkness is already over, Kaajal.

918
01:22:18,394 --> 01:22:19,999
It's time for light.

919
01:22:20,930 --> 01:22:22,461
- Come on, come with me.
- Where?

920
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:24,161
To my house.

921
01:22:38,381 --> 01:22:41,839
- Mom, how am I as a son?
- Very good son.

922
01:22:43,953 --> 01:22:45,221
You love Me?

923
01:22:46,956 --> 01:22:50,500
- That's a childish question.
- Answer me, mama.

924
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,251
For me, you are the most loved.

925
01:22:53,963 --> 01:22:59,167
Mama .. to the person
I love, you love her?

926
01:23:00,369 --> 01:23:01,800
What do you mean?

927
01:23:02,469 --> 01:23:03,200
Kaajal?

928
01:23:15,651 --> 01:23:17,817
Mom, she's Kaajal.

929
01:23:20,189 --> 01:23:21,248
I love her.

930
01:23:22,992 --> 01:23:24,000
Come, daughter.

931
01:23:26,596 --> 01:23:29,230
Namaste.
- Blessed. Be happy.

932
01:23:29,999 --> 01:23:32,200
This Saajan is a little crazy.

933
01:23:32,602 --> 01:23:34,300
He brought you here without telling you before.

934
01:23:34,737 --> 01:23:38,064
If he had told me before, he
would have gone to your house.

935
01:23:40,143 --> 01:23:43,112
Mom, Kaajal has no house.

936
01:23:44,013 --> 01:23:46,000
Kaajal's parents died.

937
01:23:47,550 --> 01:23:49,910
So who are you living
with, daughter?

938
01:23:50,286 --> 01:23:52,800
- I..
- Mama, Kaajal lives ..

939
01:23:53,522 --> 01:23:56,000
- in a brothel.
- What nonsense are you talking about?

940
01:23:56,226 --> 01:24:01,200
It is true! And I decided that Kaajal
should never go back to that brothel.

941
01:24:01,631 --> 01:24:04,300
- She will stay here.
- This is a serious matter, Saajan.

942
01:24:04,567 --> 01:24:06,800
We can not decide on
your life this way.

943
01:24:07,237 --> 01:24:11,631
Her fate was decided the day
she was taken to that brothel.

944
01:24:14,043 --> 01:24:16,903
She came to appeal
against that decision.

945
01:24:18,047 --> 01:24:21,148
Tell me, what are
your orders for her?

946
01:24:40,169 --> 01:24:42,967
Scoundrel! You dare
go to a brothel ..

947
01:24:43,072 --> 01:24:46,300
..and bring a dirt from there?
I'll flay you alive!

948
01:24:46,676 --> 01:24:48,200
Sir, listen to me, please.

949
01:24:48,478 --> 01:24:50,000
Kaajal comes from a
respectable family.

950
01:24:50,246 --> 01:24:53,000
No prostitute could
be respectable.

951
01:24:56,900 --> 01:25:00,300
At least you You should not mistreat
it as the rest of the world does.

952
01:25:00,590 --> 01:25:01,900
I am no different from society.

953
01:25:02,125 --> 01:25:03,400
Even you have to
live in this world.

954
01:25:03,693 --> 01:25:05,800
If this is your world,
then I do not want it!

955
01:25:06,095 --> 01:25:08,200
I do not want a world that
deprives a girl of her right.

956
01:25:08,498 --> 01:25:10,900
The right to be a mother,
a sister, a wife!

957
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:13,400
They keep it in a place where
it is but a living body.

958
01:25:13,603 --> 01:25:16,400
A place where people
come and offer a price.

959
01:25:16,606 --> 01:25:18,900
And then she is told
that this is the world?

960
01:25:19,108 --> 01:25:22,400
I do not want a world like this! I do not want it!

961
01:25:22,612 --> 01:25:25,000
Do you dare raise my voice?

962
01:25:25,214 --> 01:25:27,500
- Do not you dare answer me!
- Do not hit him.

963
01:25:27,717 --> 01:25:34,900
You are the dishonor of our family!
You make a hell of our lives.

964
01:25:35,124 --> 01:25:37,024
- Please leave it!
- I'll kill you!

965
01:25:38,227 --> 01:25:40,000
I will go.

966
01:25:40,296 --> 01:25:42,400
Do not! You will go where I go!

967
01:25:42,632 --> 01:25:46,300
Scoundrel! I will not
spare your life!

968
01:25:46,536 --> 01:25:49,600
- I will not let you live! I'll kill you!
- Yes, do not let me live, kill me!

969
01:25:49,839 --> 01:25:52,873
But I will not leave Kaajal!
I will not leave her! I will not leave her!

970
01:25:53,139 --> 01:25:54,273
Go away!

971
01:25:54,944 --> 01:25:58,144
A rebel like you can not
stay in my house. Go away!

972
01:25:58,681 --> 01:26:01,300
If loving and supporting
someone is to be rebellious ..

973
01:26:01,551 --> 01:26:05,000
.. then I am a rebel against
you, your law and your society!

974
01:26:05,355 --> 01:26:07,300
I'm a rebel! Yes, I'm a rebel!

975
01:26:07,557 --> 01:26:10,251
And now I will do
what a rebel must do.

976
01:26:13,662 --> 01:26:14,730
Let's go, Kaajal!

977
01:26:39,789 --> 01:26:43,250
How do you feel?

978
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:48,693
It feels good.

979
01:26:49,498 --> 01:26:53,601
The dream of love ..

980
01:26:54,203 --> 01:26:58,805
.. now it seems true.

981
01:27:18,327 --> 01:27:26,701
Let people say what
they want, beloved.

982
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:36,645
We will never break our promise.

983
01:27:37,346 --> 01:27:46,220
When someone has a partner
like this (like you) ..

984
01:27:46,622 --> 01:27:55,263
.. why would she fear the world?

985
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,168
It's my wish

986
01:28:00,570 --> 01:28:05,301
... to spend happy and
sad moments with you.

987
01:28:05,570 --> 01:28:08,901
How do you feel?

988
01:28:10,270 --> 01:28:14,101
It feels good.

989
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:18,701
The dream of love ..

990
01:28:19,570 --> 01:28:24,201
.. now it seems true.

991
01:29:01,664 --> 01:29:06,397
Saajan? Saajan?
Saajan arise, Saajan!

992
01:29:08,137 --> 01:29:09,305
What happens?

993
01:29:14,237 --> 01:29:14,905
Run!

994
01:29:16,807 --> 01:29:20,505
Saajan! DO NOT! SAAJAN !!

995
01:29:25,688 --> 01:29:26,417
What happened?

996
01:29:28,457 --> 01:29:31,100
Saajan, I had a very bad dream.

997
01:29:31,627 --> 01:29:33,987
Dream Jaggu killed you.

998
01:29:35,864 --> 01:29:39,000
Hey, it looks like you still
have not stopped fearing Jaggu.

999
01:29:39,469 --> 01:29:41,800
Do not worry, Kaajal.
Nothing will happen to us.

1000
01:29:42,171 --> 01:29:44,100
Nothing will happen to us, Kaajal,
nothing will happen to us.

1001
01:29:44,574 --> 01:29:46,324
They are very dangerous, Saajan.

1002
01:29:46,674 --> 01:29:48,404
They are very dangerous.

1003
01:29:48,911 --> 01:29:51,710
Before, a girl tried to escape.

1004
01:29:52,581 --> 01:29:56,684
But Dhanraj burns her alive. We
can not escape them, Saajan.

1005
01:29:57,301 --> 01:29:58,200
We can not!

1006
01:29:58,587 --> 01:30:00,200
We can and we sure will!

1007
01:30:00,890 --> 01:30:04,291
We'll go to the police,
they can not hurt us.

1008
01:30:05,394 --> 01:30:10,400
No. Sushmi said that
Dhanraj bribes the police.

1009
01:30:10,733 --> 01:30:14,235
Imagine if they catch us?
God forbid.

1010
01:30:16,238 --> 01:30:19,000
Then we'll get away from here.
Far away.

1011
01:30:19,408 --> 01:30:22,500
Where even the thoughts of
Dhanraj can not reach us.

1012
01:30:22,812 --> 01:30:27,600
Although not, what? The fear
of him always obsesses us.

1013
01:30:27,817 --> 01:30:31,109
And we will ask who will
attack us and when.

1014
01:30:31,687 --> 01:30:36,216
It is very difficult to live in
fear, Saajan. It is very difficult.

1015
01:30:36,625 --> 01:30:38,200
Where do you want to go?

1016
01:30:38,427 --> 01:30:40,700
We can not go home, nor can
we go to the police ..

1017
01:30:40,930 --> 01:30:42,800
.. nor to another city.
Where can we go?

1018
01:30:43,032 --> 01:30:46,400
- To the brothel, Saajan.
- To the brothel? Are you crazy?!

1019
01:30:46,602 --> 01:30:48,000
I release you with so much difficulty.

1020
01:30:48,238 --> 01:30:50,200
And you want to return to
the clutches of death?

1021
01:30:50,573 --> 01:30:55,100
- Never say that again!
- Just for a while, Saajan.

1022
01:30:55,444 --> 01:30:59,500
I'm going to see Madam Leela.
She is very good, Saajan.

1023
01:30:59,982 --> 01:31:03,782
Of her not being there, I do
not know where I would be.

1024
01:31:05,254 --> 01:31:08,300
Saajan, Madam Leela is
very good in heart.

1025
01:31:08,657 --> 01:31:12,700
She will surely help us.
Once. Just once.

1026
01:31:13,362 --> 01:31:15,200
Tell me, Saajan. Will you come?

1027
01:31:15,464 --> 01:31:18,530
Yes..if she can not
do anything for me ..

1028
01:31:18,809 --> 01:31:24,101
.. then I'll do whatever you say.

1029
01:31:24,473 --> 01:31:27,464
Tell me, will you come Saachan? Please?

1030
01:31:28,477 --> 01:31:30,377
For me.

1031
01:31:32,681 --> 01:31:36,300
- What do you say?
- I beg you, Madam Leela.

1032
01:31:36,819 --> 01:31:43,000
I do something to let go
and never hurt Saajan.

1033
01:31:43,292 --> 01:31:47,595
You're asking for something
that no one ever got.

1034
01:31:48,197 --> 01:31:50,000
It's impossible, daughter.

1035
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:52,900
There are many ways to get here ..

1036
01:31:53,102 --> 01:31:55,800
..but only one way out ..

1037
01:31:56,005 --> 01:31:57,400
..and that is death.

1038
01:31:57,673 --> 01:32:00,731
Which paves the way to Dhanraj Street.

1039
01:32:01,610 --> 01:32:03,300
You call me your daughter, Madam Leela.

1040
01:32:03,713 --> 01:32:05,000
What kind of mother are you?

1041
01:32:05,381 --> 01:32:08,314
You can not do anything for your daughter?

1042
01:32:10,352 --> 01:32:13,300
Does this guy really love you?

1043
01:32:13,589 --> 01:32:16,222
He left his house for me, Madam Leela.

1044
01:32:20,629 --> 01:32:22,800
If I had a house of my own

1045
01:32:23,032 --> 01:32:26,160
..and would have arranged
everything for the wedding.

1046
01:32:26,435 --> 01:32:28,200
I would have put henna in your hands.

1047
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:31,400
And I would have sent you
in a palanquin with him.

1048
01:32:31,607 --> 01:32:33,500
But in the place that I am today ..

1049
01:32:34,343 --> 01:32:38,000
.. from here do not come palanquines,
from here come feretros.

1050
01:32:38,214 --> 01:32:41,775
Ferrets of people .. and sometimes,
ferrets of their dreams.

1051
01:32:42,551 --> 01:32:45,600
I wonder how many people
will be killed by you?

1052
01:32:45,888 --> 01:32:49,790
Madam Leela, it is arranged
that Kaajal will leave here.

1053
01:32:50,559 --> 01:32:53,858
Being happy, not being happy.

1054
01:32:54,363 --> 01:32:57,564
Now the decision is in your hands.

1055
01:32:58,834 --> 01:33:02,400
There is only one way out. Go with Dhanraj.

1056
01:33:02,705 --> 01:33:04,400
And try to convince him.

1057
01:33:04,974 --> 01:33:08,603
Maybe your words from the
heart can change your mind.

1058
01:33:10,112 --> 01:33:13,279
- Where can I find it?
- In the palace Dhanraj.

1059
01:33:14,316 --> 01:33:15,975
Every day has a reception.

1060
01:33:20,924 --> 01:33:23,893
- What job do you do for me?
- I came with an order, sir.

1061
01:33:26,763 --> 01:33:29,857
- Tell me, what's the order?
- There's a girl in her brothel.

1062
01:33:30,567 --> 01:33:32,700
If you. I will be very grateful.

1063
01:33:32,970 --> 01:33:35,900
Why? She is your lost sister

1064
01:33:36,106 --> 01:33:39,007
She has no relation
to me, not to you.

1065
01:33:39,510 --> 01:33:42,670
She is in your custody,
please release her, sir.

1066
01:33:46,049 --> 01:33:48,745
Why? You fell in love with her

1067
01:33:49,519 --> 01:33:51,416
That's right, sir.

1068
01:33:53,857 --> 01:33:58,021
You damn university
students are idiots!

1069
01:33:58,662 --> 01:34:02,826
The minute they see the girls ..
They are ready to die for them.

1070
01:34:04,535 --> 01:34:06,435
What is love?

1071
01:34:06,937 --> 01:34:09,300
The need to satisfy the
physical desire ..

1072
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:11,700
..is the love for these
respectable people.

1073
01:34:11,942 --> 01:34:13,102
Love!

1074
01:34:14,545 --> 01:34:17,705
Forget this. Everything is so stupid.
Leave it like this.

1075
01:34:19,950 --> 01:34:22,643
You seem to be from a
respectable family.

1076
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:25,784
Marry a respectable girl.

1077
01:34:26,990 --> 01:34:29,300
Why do you want to take
a prostitute home?

1078
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:31,528
And ruin my business?

1079
01:34:31,962 --> 01:34:35,864
Look, I'm not indulgent
when it comes to business.

1080
01:34:36,466 --> 01:34:38,300
Once a girl comes
to my brothel ..

1081
01:34:38,869 --> 01:34:40,500
.. she can not leave, do you understand?

1082
01:34:41,001 --> 01:34:44,000
Lord, I beg you. Please
release Kaajal, please sir.

1083
01:34:44,274 --> 01:34:46,067
Oh! Do not make me angry, son.

1084
01:34:46,710 --> 01:34:48,300
It will not be good for you, go!

1085
01:34:48,579 --> 01:34:51,070
Lord, I'll do what you want. Say

1086
01:34:51,582 --> 01:34:53,675
I will make money and I will give it to you.

1087
01:34:53,984 --> 01:34:56,077
- But please release Kaajal.
- What?

1088
01:34:57,988 --> 01:34:59,300
- Will you give me money?
- Yes sir.

1089
01:34:59,589 --> 01:35:03,091
Get off! Are you buying
a TV in installments?

1090
01:35:03,594 --> 01:35:05,494
Sir, please do not say that.

1091
01:35:06,997 --> 01:35:10,489
- Please do not disappoint me.
- Get off! Get off!

1092
01:35:11,301 --> 01:35:12,391
Moron!

1093
01:35:12,869 --> 01:35:17,800
Chote, take this lover and
throw him in the drain.

1094
01:35:18,008 --> 01:35:21,042
Not me, you. Will go to the drain!
Dhanraj!

1095
01:35:21,612 --> 01:35:23,400
Hit him so much

1096
01:35:23,614 --> 01:35:25,800
..that he will not go to
the brothel next time.

1097
01:35:26,083 --> 01:35:29,109
- Take it away.
- I will not leave without Kaajal.

1098
01:35:29,886 --> 01:35:31,513
Dhanraj releases it.

1099
01:35:32,155 --> 01:35:34,800
A true lover! Not like you.

1100
01:35:35,058 --> 01:35:39,000
- Take him and hit him! Come on.
- I will not leave! I will not leave!

1101
01:37:29,206 --> 01:37:30,639
Let's look who it is.

1102
01:37:32,008 --> 01:37:34,300
- He's our commander.
- I could die.

1103
01:37:34,511 --> 01:37:36,304
- Let's get him to the hospital.
- Let's go, friends.

1104
01:37:38,511 --> 01:37:40,204
Saajan? Saajan?

1105
01:37:43,286 --> 01:37:44,981
I will not die.

1106
01:37:46,890 --> 01:37:48,653
I will not die.

1107
01:37:50,090 --> 01:37:51,003
Kaajal!

1108
01:38:16,253 --> 01:38:20,019
Madam Leela! Balbir is here.

1109
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:25,353
Madam Leela, Balbir,
Dhanraj's brother is here.

1110
01:38:29,672 --> 01:38:32,528
You two of the seństans sitting here.
I will go and see.

1111
01:38:33,203 --> 01:38:34,693
Hey, Madam Leela.

1112
01:38:37,941 --> 01:38:40,307
Come on! Come on!

1113
01:38:40,811 --> 01:38:43,041
This brothel is honored.

1114
01:38:43,814 --> 01:38:46,505
Tell me, what are your orders, Mr.
Balbir?

1115
01:38:48,351 --> 01:38:50,182
I came to see Laila.

1116
01:38:51,288 --> 01:38:53,200
So here you are looking for Laila.

1117
01:38:53,423 --> 01:38:57,200
Your Highness! Please sit down for a while.
Have a drink.

1118
01:38:57,427 --> 01:39:01,600
Bring Laila, Shirin,
Heer, all before you.

1119
01:39:01,832 --> 01:39:03,600
- Hey, stop.
- There I go.

1120
01:39:03,834 --> 01:39:07,395
Call all the girls outside.
The boss is here.

1121
01:39:09,272 --> 01:39:13,100
Forget about them. Where is she?

1122
01:39:14,044 --> 01:39:16,600
- Who?
- That boy went crazy.

1123
01:39:16,847 --> 01:39:20,339
- What boy?
- The one who went to see my brother.

1124
01:39:22,185 --> 01:39:26,600
He said, "Sir, my girl
is in her brothel."

1125
01:39:26,857 --> 01:39:29,087
Release it! My butt!

1126
01:39:30,293 --> 01:39:33,100
- Where is that boy?
- The idiot must be dead already!

1127
01:39:33,396 --> 01:39:37,093
Do not!

1128
01:39:39,269 --> 01:39:41,200
Lord, tell me you're lying!

1129
01:39:41,404 --> 01:39:44,100
Say you're lying!

1130
01:39:44,607 --> 01:39:47,600
Tell me that Saajan is fine.

1131
01:39:48,378 --> 01:39:54,113
Tell me that Dhanraj will release me.
Tell me! Tell me!

1132
01:39:58,889 --> 01:40:00,789
So this is the girl ?!

1133
01:40:02,492 --> 01:40:08,124
Beautiful. Hey, guys!
Take this girl!

1134
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:11,700
You can not take it with you.

1135
01:40:11,902 --> 01:40:14,302
- No, you can not take it!
- Get out.

1136
01:40:15,906 --> 01:40:17,700
Come on, get her in the car.

1137
01:40:17,908 --> 01:40:20,100
Balbir, you are not worthy of her.
Let her go.

1138
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:23,000
- Why? She is your daughter?
- Yes she is my daughter!

1139
01:40:23,246 --> 01:40:26,340
Daughter, my ass! Back to work!

1140
01:40:44,134 --> 01:40:45,424
This idiot alive!

1141
01:40:47,634 --> 01:40:49,824
Come on! Come on!

1142
01:41:31,982 --> 01:41:36,214
Release it. Release it, sirguy!

1143
01:41:36,987 --> 01:41:38,284
Come on, Paro.

1144
01:41:44,394 --> 01:41:46,555
- Take her, Sushmi.
Yes.

1145
01:41:49,432 --> 01:41:51,559
Hey, what's going on?

1146
01:42:01,032 --> 01:42:01,859
Kaajal?

1147
01:42:10,032 --> 01:42:10,859
Kaajal?

1148
01:42:12,732 --> 01:42:13,659
Kaajal?

1149
01:42:29,732 --> 01:42:30,659
Kaajal?

1150
01:42:40,050 --> 01:42:41,950
Come on, Paro.

1151
01:42:50,644 --> 01:42:52,759
Buddha, Time, Refill, Come on!

1152
01:43:00,744 --> 01:43:03,759
Time, Refill, come, fast!

1153
01:43:04,144 --> 01:43:04,759
Tempo!

1154
01:43:06,076 --> 01:43:07,304
Let's move on!

1155
01:43:21,524 --> 01:43:22,991
Chase them!

1156
01:43:26,629 --> 01:43:29,154
Chase them! Get the car!

1157
01:43:38,108 --> 01:43:42,340
Female dog!
Are you involved with them?

1158
01:43:43,513 --> 01:43:45,300
Sir, what does he do? She is my sister.

1159
01:43:45,582 --> 01:43:49,348
Hey, mister! I told her she's my sister.
What she did?

1160
01:43:51,121 --> 01:43:54,200
What she did? I'll tell you!

1161
01:43:54,457 --> 01:43:56,425
Now you know who did that!

1162
01:43:56,727 --> 01:43:59,200
Hey, take the two with my brother!

1163
01:43:59,462 --> 01:44:03,023
Hey, do not touch my sister!
Release my sister!

1164
01:44:23,686 --> 01:44:26,655
Tell the truth, Jaggu. Tell the truth.

1165
01:44:27,423 --> 01:44:31,382
Look. I like the truth.

1166
01:44:32,162 --> 01:44:35,022
Really, boss. Do not
take any money.

1167
01:44:35,498 --> 01:44:37,056
I do not touch anything, boss.

1168
01:44:39,435 --> 01:44:43,064
Agree. You did not take the money.

1169
01:44:43,573 --> 01:44:46,667
And your sister did not
prick Chote's wheel either.

1170
01:44:48,178 --> 01:44:50,999
- But that girl did not run?
- I'm running.

1171
01:44:51,314 --> 01:44:54,000
- From whose brothel?
- Yours.

1172
01:44:54,384 --> 01:44:56,352
And the news does not
run through the market?

1173
01:44:56,786 --> 01:44:58,954
Yes.
- What did the news say?

1174
01:44:59,722 --> 01:45:05,252
That girl from the brothel of Dhanraj
fled before the men of Dhanraj!

1175
01:45:06,462 --> 01:45:09,431
Tell me, do not we have a bad
reputation in the market?

1176
01:45:10,733 --> 01:45:14,100
And who is in charge of that brothel?

1177
01:45:15,205 --> 01:45:17,500
Who? It's you! True?

1178
01:45:17,740 --> 01:45:19,708
- Yes Boss!
Yes.

1179
01:45:20,210 --> 01:45:23,500
It means that you
defamed yourself!

1180
01:45:23,746 --> 01:45:25,000
Boss.

1181
01:45:26,482 --> 01:45:28,000
Castigeme.

1182
01:45:28,618 --> 01:45:30,979
Also punish me for the
mistake of my sister, boss.

1183
01:45:31,221 --> 01:45:33,000
I'll do that for sure!

1184
01:45:33,223 --> 01:45:35,714
Because she fled, and others
will want to do the same.

1185
01:45:36,226 --> 01:45:39,320
My business was ruined.
The brothel would be deserted.

1186
01:45:40,230 --> 01:45:44,322
But in reality this idiot
is my oldest helper.

1187
01:45:44,767 --> 01:45:48,635
He was so small when I
took him out of the drain.

1188
01:45:49,239 --> 01:45:53,300
And her sister was so small ..
in her arms.

1189
01:45:53,643 --> 01:45:56,104
He is an old assistant of mine.
And he's still a child.

1190
01:45:56,579 --> 01:45:58,000
If it were another ..

1191
01:45:58,248 --> 01:46:02,500
..and put it in the freezer
of an ice cream factory.

1192
01:46:02,719 --> 01:46:04,600
He would have died frozen.

1193
01:46:04,854 --> 01:46:09,487
But the punishment I think
for him is incredible.

1194
01:46:10,260 --> 01:46:12,300
His sister will ..

1195
01:46:12,595 --> 01:46:14,825
- ..the place of that girl.
- Do not!

1196
01:46:15,932 --> 01:46:17,165
Do not!

1197
01:46:17,533 --> 01:46:22,000
Boss, Sushmi is my sister, boss.
My sister.

1198
01:46:22,371 --> 01:46:24,039
Now you think of your sister?

1199
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:26,000
You forget those days in
which you betrayed ..

1200
01:46:26,276 --> 01:46:28,800
..the sisters of others to the brothel?
Oh, stop that.

1201
01:46:29,211 --> 01:46:32,500
Non-money relationships are
important in our business.

1202
01:46:32,749 --> 01:46:35,775
- What?
- Boss, give me another chance.

1203
01:46:36,352 --> 01:46:39,515
- I'll trace them somehow.
- That's not the problem.

1204
01:46:40,290 --> 01:46:44,700
Where can they escape? I
told Inspector D'souza ..

1205
01:46:45,294 --> 01:46:47,786
.. ask questions. Speak you.

1206
01:46:48,765 --> 01:46:50,858
- Say yes or no?
- Brother!

1207
01:46:51,565 --> 01:46:53,008
Sushmi!

1208
01:46:57,665 --> 01:46:59,608
Sushmi! Sushmi!

1209
01:47:04,847 --> 01:47:06,700
Boss, mercy, boss!

1210
01:47:06,916 --> 01:47:10,415
Sushmi is my sister!
Have mercy, boss!

1211
01:47:14,324 --> 01:47:15,621
Hey, do not do it!

1212
01:47:21,864 --> 01:47:23,889
Do not! Let go!

1213
01:47:34,811 --> 01:47:36,836
Boss, stop them, boss!

1214
01:47:53,363 --> 01:47:54,455
Brother!

1215
01:47:57,367 --> 01:47:59,700
No, boss! That makes?

1216
01:47:59,969 --> 01:48:02,100
She is my sister! Excuse me!

1217
01:48:02,372 --> 01:48:04,602
Have mercy!

1218
01:48:05,641 --> 01:48:07,268
Release me!

1219
01:48:31,801 --> 01:48:32,700
Moron!

1220
01:48:33,403 --> 01:48:35,600
You happily put the sisters
of others in this business.

1221
01:48:35,805 --> 01:48:38,797
Now, when it's your sister's
turn, are you crying ?!

1222
01:48:41,878 --> 01:48:45,974
Boss. Have mercy, boss.

1223
01:48:56,426 --> 01:48:58,326
He is dead to me!

1224
01:48:59,429 --> 01:49:01,200
It is better not to have children,
than to have a child like him.

1225
01:49:01,431 --> 01:49:05,390
- What is the crime of Saajan?
- Kidnapping a girl.

1226
01:49:05,968 --> 01:49:08,937
- What a Girl?
- A girl from the brothel of Dhanraj.

1227
01:49:09,972 --> 01:49:11,500
That prostitute?

1228
01:49:11,774 --> 01:49:14,300
He made many enemies
by taking that girl.

1229
01:49:14,577 --> 01:49:17,100
He gave a terrible beating
to Dhanraj's brother.

1230
01:49:17,346 --> 01:49:20,500
And sent three of his
men to the hospital.

1231
01:49:20,746 --> 01:49:24,700
What? Saajan fought
with Dhanraj's men?

1232
01:49:24,999 --> 01:49:25,500
Yes.

1233
01:49:25,788 --> 01:49:27,200
The beating of Dhanraj's brother and ..

1234
01:49:27,457 --> 01:49:29,400
... send three of your
men to the hospital?

1235
01:49:29,657 --> 01:49:30,100
Yes.

1236
01:49:30,393 --> 01:49:32,691
- Saajan did all that?
Yes.

1237
01:49:34,931 --> 01:49:36,500
You lying, officer?

1238
01:49:36,799 --> 01:49:38,800
The cops exaggerate things.

1239
01:49:39,268 --> 01:49:41,366
There's no need for
me to lie, sir.

1240
01:49:44,474 --> 01:49:47,100
I could never have thought
of that useless boy ..

1241
01:49:47,476 --> 01:49:50,537
- .. would prove to be so brave.
- What does he say, sir?

1242
01:49:51,013 --> 01:49:54,449
Are you praising her
for kidnapping a girl?

1243
01:49:55,485 --> 01:49:59,581
To kidnap a girl, not
to hit those thugs.

1244
01:50:00,022 --> 01:50:02,200
Although the motives
are wrong, official ..

1245
01:50:02,492 --> 01:50:04,892
- he did a wonderful job.
- Why not?

1246
01:50:05,628 --> 01:50:08,062
Parents like you. They
ruin their children.

1247
01:50:08,631 --> 01:50:11,700
And the police are annoyed
by those reasons.

1248
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:13,700
Maybe you. Do not understand, Inspector.

1249
01:50:13,970 --> 01:50:15,995
I'll even tell him something.

1250
01:50:17,039 --> 01:50:19,007
He wanted Saajan
to join the army.

1251
01:50:20,109 --> 01:50:22,907
Thus one day he would
become a brave soldier.

1252
01:50:25,047 --> 01:50:30,300
He did not join the army, but
by this act he showed that ..

1253
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:32,488
..he is brave and has courage!

1254
01:50:58,014 --> 01:51:02,900
It is full moon night,
you are with me.

1255
01:51:03,214 --> 01:51:08,151
It is full moon night,
you are with me.

1256
01:51:08,424 --> 01:51:13,052
The air is a little cold, there
is also pain in the heart.

1257
01:51:13,624 --> 01:51:18,252
The air is a little cold, there
is also pain in the heart.

1258
01:51:18,668 --> 01:51:23,300
The pain is cruel, there is
a conversation on the lips.

1259
01:51:23,573 --> 01:51:28,400
It is full moon night,
you are with me.

1260
01:51:28,673 --> 01:51:33,460
It's a full moon
night, you're with me.

1261
01:51:33,783 --> 01:51:38,646
The air is a little cold, there
is also pain in the heart.

1262
01:51:39,003 --> 01:51:43,900
The air is a little cold, there
is also pain in the heart.

1263
01:51:44,160 --> 01:51:49,020
The pain is cruel, there is
a conversation on the lips.

1264
01:51:49,373 --> 01:51:54,076
It's a full moon
night, you're with me.

1265
01:51:54,273 --> 01:51:59,276
It's a full moon
night, you're with me.

1266
01:52:25,067 --> 01:52:29,800
I'm on fire from
this intense fire.

1267
01:52:30,039 --> 01:52:34,874
My eyes do not move away from your body.

1268
01:52:40,467 --> 01:52:45,400
I'm on fire from
this intense fire.

1269
01:52:45,639 --> 01:52:49,800
My eyes do not move away from your body.

1270
01:52:50,032 --> 01:52:55,089
Do not talk to me like this, I'm afraid.

1271
01:52:55,532 --> 01:53:00,589
Do not talk to me like this, I'm afraid.

1272
01:53:00,803 --> 01:53:10,175
The restlessness increases,
my hands are in your hands.

1273
01:53:10,603 --> 01:53:15,400
It's a full moon
night, you're with me.

1274
01:53:15,673 --> 01:53:20,576
It's a full moon
night, you're with me.

1275
01:53:56,792 --> 01:54:01,500
I am lost in dreams
and thoughts.

1276
01:54:01,731 --> 01:54:06,828
My eyes are wide awake
while I am asleep.

1277
01:54:11,642 --> 01:54:17,000
I am lost in dreams
and thoughts.

1278
01:54:17,231 --> 01:54:22,000
My eyes are wide awake
while I am asleep.

1279
01:54:22,217 --> 01:54:26,400
Without you, I can not sleep.

1280
01:54:26,667 --> 01:54:32,000
Without you, I can not sleep.

1281
01:54:32,361 --> 01:54:42,100
What will be our state, if
this is only the beginning.

1282
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:47,100
It's a full moon
night, you're with me.

1283
01:54:47,309 --> 01:54:52,213
It's a full moon
night, you're with me.

1284
01:54:52,419 --> 01:54:57,213
The air is a little cold, there
is also pain in the heart.

1285
01:54:57,609 --> 01:55:02,213
The air is a little cold, there
is also pain in the heart.

1286
01:55:02,609 --> 01:55:07,400
The pain is cruel, there is
a conversation on the lips.

1287
01:55:07,604 --> 01:55:12,800
It's a full moon
night, you're with me.

1288
01:55:13,009 --> 01:55:17,999
It's a full moon
night, you're with me.

1289
01:55:19,341 --> 01:55:23,600
It is full moon night,
we are with you.

1290
01:55:23,813 --> 01:55:28,000
The air is a little cold, there
is also pain in the heart.

1291
01:55:28,284 --> 01:55:32,600
The pain is cruel, there is
a conversation on the lips.

1292
01:55:32,822 --> 01:55:35,100
It's a full moon night ..

1293
01:55:35,357 --> 01:55:37,382
Let's move on! Let's move on!

1294
01:55:40,830 --> 01:55:43,060
..we are with you.

1295
01:55:48,237 --> 01:55:50,300
- Come on come on.
- Come on.

1296
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:54,100
Take, thank you, bye! Thank you!

1297
01:55:54,376 --> 01:55:58,335
It is full moon night,
we are with you.

1298
01:56:03,976 --> 01:56:07,235
SUSHMI!

1299
01:56:13,376 --> 01:56:14,335
Jaggu?

1300
01:56:15,576 --> 01:56:16,335
Jaggu?

1301
01:56:17,299 --> 01:56:18,766
Be brave, Jaggu.

1302
01:56:20,576 --> 01:56:21,335
Jaggu?

1303
01:56:28,277 --> 01:56:30,100
May God keep you happy, son.

1304
01:56:30,346 --> 01:56:32,200
You brought back our granddaughter.

1305
01:56:32,614 --> 01:56:34,800
I will never forget
this favor in my life.

1306
01:56:35,084 --> 01:56:37,245
But dear... where have
you been all these days?

1307
01:56:40,289 --> 01:56:42,782
You will not be able to
hear my story, Grandma.

1308
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:46,453
It's worse than a nightmare.

1309
01:56:47,629 --> 01:56:50,389
- What do you mean?
- I'll tell you, Grandma.

1310
01:56:50,900 --> 01:56:52,128
It's a terrible story.

1311
01:56:52,902 --> 01:56:55,862
This little girl and a
big city like Mumbai.

1312
01:56:56,438 --> 01:56:59,100
And to add, a lot of work.

1313
01:56:59,308 --> 01:57:03,100
All day she had to
keep her head down.

1314
01:57:03,645 --> 01:57:05,404
She did not have time to lift it.

1315
01:57:06,315 --> 01:57:08,876
But dear, what job was it?

1316
01:57:09,485 --> 01:57:11,300
- I..
- I'll tell you, Grandpa.

1317
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:14,123
His work was very difficult.

1318
01:57:15,720 --> 01:57:18,083
She used to count the days.

1319
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:20,300
- Count the days?
Yes.

1320
01:57:20,729 --> 01:57:22,700
And counting the days is
a very difficult job.

1321
01:57:22,932 --> 01:57:25,300
- Tell me, what day is it today?
- Saturday.

1322
01:57:25,567 --> 01:57:29,100
Saturday.
But in America, it's Friday.

1323
01:57:29,671 --> 01:57:32,200
While in New Zealand,
it is already Sunday.

1324
01:57:32,608 --> 01:57:36,700
In a single day, three days!
In a single day, three days, Grandpa!

1325
01:57:36,999 --> 01:57:40,905
Then the hours, minutes
and seconds of a day.

1326
01:57:41,350 --> 01:57:44,046
Just think how hard it
is to count the days.

1327
01:57:44,420 --> 01:57:49,000
Yes. I am not surprised that my child
did not have time to write to us.

1328
01:57:49,291 --> 01:57:52,700
Rest, we'll talk later.
Now let's go freshen up.

1329
01:57:52,962 --> 01:57:56,454
- I'll show you around.
- I'll make arrangements to eat.

1330
01:58:04,762 --> 01:58:05,854
Saajan?

1331
01:58:06,775 --> 01:58:09,403
Why did not you let me tell
Grandfather the truth?

1332
01:58:12,982 --> 01:58:16,884
It hurts to think about
the past and the death.

1333
01:58:18,387 --> 01:58:21,200
Why do you want to
hurt these people?

1334
01:58:21,657 --> 01:58:23,482
Share your happiness with them.

1335
01:58:25,127 --> 01:58:28,096
The happiness of freedom
that is in your smile.

1336
01:58:28,397 --> 01:58:31,791
Of victory, which is now in
the brightness of your eyes.

1337
01:58:32,401 --> 01:58:34,494
You forgot to include
a happiness, Saajan.

1338
01:58:35,471 --> 01:58:39,237
The happiness of being with you.
That is in the beating of my heart.

1339
01:58:44,279 --> 01:58:46,577
What is going on brothers What?

1340
01:58:47,116 --> 01:58:50,800
Saajan is narrating his love
story to his girlfriend.

1341
01:58:51,220 --> 01:58:53,200
Hero and heroine embrace.

1342
01:58:53,489 --> 01:58:56,430
- Friend, break my head.
- Why brother? Why?

1343
01:58:56,725 --> 01:58:59,519
Hero and heroine embracing.
What are we three doing here?

1344
01:59:00,162 --> 01:59:03,100
We are characters in this story.

1345
01:59:03,365 --> 01:59:05,826
- As?
- You would not understand, my friend.

1346
01:59:06,368 --> 01:59:10,270
Look, your character is already bad!

1347
01:59:12,107 --> 01:59:15,543
We have much to do. I have to
get Saajan and Kaajal married.

1348
01:59:16,311 --> 01:59:18,279
- Why should you marry them?
- Because I'm the eldest.

1349
01:59:19,048 --> 01:59:21,300
You sit down. There are
older people here.

1350
01:59:21,517 --> 01:59:22,950
Leave it to them.

1351
01:59:24,186 --> 01:59:25,578
Saajan, son?

1352
01:59:27,322 --> 01:59:30,291
- Yes, Grandpa?
- I want to talk to you.

1353
01:59:31,460 --> 01:59:34,293
Son, you told me a story.

1354
01:59:35,197 --> 01:59:39,293
But the state in which these
have another story to tell.

1355
01:59:40,669 --> 01:59:44,769
Only with the clothes you wear, you
can not go on a long journey, son.

1356
01:59:45,807 --> 01:59:48,132
My experience says...

1357
01:59:49,478 --> 01:59:55,144
..wherever you got Kaajal,
she was in serious trouble.

1358
01:59:56,618 --> 01:59:57,983
If you. Wants to listen

1359
01:59:59,354 --> 02:00:01,322
.. then I am ready to
tell you the truth.

1360
02:00:02,091 --> 02:00:03,791
No, son, no.

1361
02:00:04,493 --> 02:00:09,392
It is better if certain
truths remain undisclosed.

1362
02:00:10,632 --> 02:00:14,500
All I want to know
is how long ..

1363
02:00:15,104 --> 02:00:18,535
..decide to support Kaajal?

1364
02:00:20,642 --> 02:00:21,900
Grandfather.

1365
02:00:22,311 --> 02:00:25,100
I promise to support
Kaajal all my life.

1366
02:00:25,314 --> 02:00:29,016
Saajan, son, today I
feel relieved of weight.

1367
02:00:30,385 --> 02:00:35,084
May God give both of them all
the happiness of the world.

1368
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:12,560
The promise of love is the
greatest of all promises.

1369
02:01:14,556 --> 02:01:19,000
The promise of love is the
greatest of all promises.

1370
02:01:19,301 --> 02:01:24,671
Even after we die, we will
not break this promise.

1371
02:01:29,056 --> 02:01:33,850
The promise of love is the
greatest of all promises.

1372
02:01:34,101 --> 02:01:38,500
Even after we die, we will
not break this promise.

1373
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:44,090
I will leave all the happiness of the world.

1374
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:50,990
I will leave all the happiness of the world.

1375
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:56,000
But I'll never leave your side.

1376
02:01:56,205 --> 02:02:00,500
The promise of love is the
greatest of all promises.

1377
02:02:00,742 --> 02:02:05,500
Even after we die, we will
not break this promise.

1378
02:02:05,747 --> 02:02:11,777
I will leave all the happiness of the world.

1379
02:02:13,547 --> 02:02:18,070
I will leave all the happiness of the world.

1380
02:02:18,327 --> 02:02:23,130
But I'll never leave your side.

1381
02:02:23,505 --> 02:02:29,000
The promise of love is the
greatest of all promises.

1382
02:03:03,538 --> 02:03:08,000
In my breath is your melody.

1383
02:03:08,477 --> 02:03:13,305
In the beat of my heart
there are songs about you.

1384
02:03:18,538 --> 02:03:23,000
In my breath is your melody.

1385
02:03:23,477 --> 02:03:27,705
In the beat of my heart
there are songs about you.

1386
02:03:28,297 --> 02:03:33,100
This life is not enough for me ..

1387
02:03:33,302 --> 02:03:37,700
..for you will be born again.

1388
02:03:37,906 --> 02:03:42,500
The cocoon of my heart blossomed.

1389
02:03:42,811 --> 02:03:47,410
I finally found my destiny.

1390
02:03:48,317 --> 02:03:53,100
If strong winds come,
they should go back.

1391
02:03:53,322 --> 02:03:57,224
We can also face storms.

1392
02:03:57,505 --> 02:04:02,000
The promise of love is the
greatest of all promises.

1393
02:04:02,342 --> 02:04:07,100
Even after we die, we will
not break this promise.

1394
02:04:49,378 --> 02:04:54,000
The eyes met, and the
eyelashes came down.

1395
02:04:54,383 --> 02:04:59,343
I do not know where I got lost.

1396
02:05:04,378 --> 02:05:08,850
The eyes met, and the
eyelashes came down.

1397
02:05:09,183 --> 02:05:13,743
I do not know where I got lost.

1398
02:05:14,069 --> 02:05:18,500
At first glance, my companion ..

1399
02:05:18,807 --> 02:05:23,500
.. we came back from each other.

1400
02:05:23,745 --> 02:05:28,200
A new desire is awakening.

1401
02:05:28,417 --> 02:05:32,911
Now the world looks beautiful.

1402
02:05:33,822 --> 02:05:38,200
Wishing it breaks, it does not break.
Wanting separation, does not separate.

1403
02:05:38,627 --> 02:05:42,600
We will have such a connection

1404
02:05:43,031 --> 02:05:47,600
The promise of love is the
greatest of all promises.

1405
02:05:47,836 --> 02:05:52,200
Even after we die, we will
not break this promise.

1406
02:05:52,741 --> 02:05:57,936
I will leave all the happiness of the world.

1407
02:06:00,014 --> 02:06:04,500
I will leave all the happiness of the world.

1408
02:06:04,786 --> 02:06:09,400
But I'll never leave your side.

1409
02:06:09,700 --> 02:06:16,300
The promise of love is the
greatest of all promises.

1410
02:06:20,701 --> 02:06:21,500
Hello?

1411
02:06:21,771 --> 02:06:23,000
Hello? Mom?

1412
02:06:23,272 --> 02:06:27,699
Saajan? Saajan, son, where are you?
How are you?

1413
02:06:28,743 --> 02:06:31,060
That's way to leave
the house and go?

1414
02:06:31,379 --> 02:06:34,348
I do not leave the house, mama.
The Lord cast me.

1415
02:06:34,716 --> 02:06:38,575
Fool boy! He is crabby,
but he is not your enemy.

1416
02:06:38,887 --> 02:06:41,115
No father is an enemy of his son!

1417
02:06:41,490 --> 02:06:45,189
Talk to him, he will help you, take.

1418
02:06:48,497 --> 02:06:50,590
Mom, I do not need anyone's help.

1419
02:06:50,899 --> 02:06:53,900
The past past. Now
Kaajal is free.

1420
02:06:54,402 --> 02:06:56,300
And we'll get married tomorrow.

1421
02:06:56,638 --> 02:06:59,374
What?
Do you marry without our presence?

1422
02:06:59,608 --> 02:07:01,735
- Saajan is getting married?
- Yes mom!

1423
02:07:03,411 --> 02:07:05,079
You fucking idiot! Unfortunate!

1424
02:07:07,782 --> 02:07:08,908
What happened?

1425
02:07:11,452 --> 02:07:12,817
I pick up the phone.

1426
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:39,717
Vandana.

1427
02:07:40,549 --> 02:07:42,300
Where do I call Saajan?

1428
02:07:42,551 --> 02:07:44,350
The operator said Ooty (Tamil Nadu)

1429
02:07:45,086 --> 02:07:46,851
Let's go to Ooty.

1430
02:07:47,622 --> 02:07:49,647
I want to see my son
dressed as a boyfriend.

1431
02:07:51,292 --> 02:07:52,457
I will not go.

1432
02:07:53,028 --> 02:07:56,000
You know him.
Whether we go or not ..

1433
02:07:56,364 --> 02:07:57,657
..he would surely marry.

1434
02:07:57,966 --> 02:08:01,267
And she will become your daughter-in-law.

1435
02:08:01,703 --> 02:08:05,500
- Colonel Sood's daughter-in-law.
- Vandana, if he does not need us ..

1436
02:08:05,804 --> 02:08:08,700
..not then we either.

1437
02:08:08,977 --> 02:08:11,810
We do need it.
He is our son.

1438
02:08:12,113 --> 02:08:17,983
Our only child. Your pain is ours.
And his happiness is ours.

1439
02:08:18,587 --> 02:08:20,300
Being his parents ..

1440
02:08:20,589 --> 02:08:23,990
"It is our duty to go to your wedding."
- Do not talk nonsense Vandana!

1441
02:08:24,926 --> 02:08:28,700
I will not break my
principles for a rebel!

1442
02:08:29,230 --> 02:08:30,700
- Then you will not come?
- Do not!

1443
02:08:30,999 --> 02:08:33,033
Then do not come!

1444
02:08:33,602 --> 02:08:37,094
Stay confined to the walls
of your false principles!

1445
02:08:37,606 --> 02:08:41,042
But take that picture
you see every day.

1446
02:08:41,610 --> 02:08:45,102
That speaks for itself! This
shattered Lord Colonel!

1447
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:48,110
Lost in the front of
the love of Saajan.

1448
02:08:48,550 --> 02:08:52,311
And the politics of war says that
the one who loses must surrender.

1449
02:08:56,825 --> 02:08:57,691
Vandana.

1450
02:09:00,299 --> 02:09:02,891
Today, for the first time in my
life, I am in front of your eyes ..

1451
02:09:03,599 --> 02:09:05,201
..not knowing what to say.

1452
02:09:13,642 --> 02:09:20,878
Let me decorate this
part of your hair.

1453
02:09:21,716 --> 02:09:28,554
Let me put the bindi
on your forehead.

1454
02:09:29,658 --> 02:09:36,564
Allow me to dress you
with the red veil.

1455
02:09:37,666 --> 02:09:44,902
Let me make you a girlfriend.

1456
02:09:45,674 --> 02:09:49,400
Let me adorn you
with my own hands.

1457
02:09:49,678 --> 02:09:53,170
Let me hold you and love you.

1458
02:09:53,674 --> 02:09:57,100
Let me adorn you
with my own hands.

1459
02:09:57,678 --> 02:10:00,990
Let me hold you and love you.

1460
02:10:01,222 --> 02:10:05,000
Let me enhance your beauty.

1461
02:10:05,293 --> 02:10:09,000
Let me put the garland
of flowers today.

1462
02:10:09,230 --> 02:10:12,597
How do you feel?

1463
02:10:13,234 --> 02:10:16,931
It feels good.

1464
02:10:17,305 --> 02:10:20,797
The dream of love ..

1465
02:10:21,176 --> 02:10:25,806
.. now it seems true.

1466
02:10:37,327 --> 02:10:38,200
Police?

1467
02:10:38,727 --> 02:10:39,800
Who are married?

1468
02:10:40,061 --> 02:10:42,800
The bride and groom get
married, of course, sir.

1469
02:10:43,197 --> 02:10:45,788
Shut up.
Hey boy, what's your name?

1470
02:10:47,268 --> 02:10:49,964
Saajan.
But we did not commit any crime.

1471
02:10:50,638 --> 02:10:52,406
We are marrying the
consent of our elders.

1472
02:10:52,741 --> 02:10:54,809
The name of the girl
is Paro aka Kaajal?

1473
02:10:55,143 --> 02:10:57,300
Yes.
- Both of you come to the police station.

1474
02:10:57,648 --> 02:10:59,800
What is it, sir? Did the
kids do something wrong?

1475
02:11:00,081 --> 02:11:02,000
This boy kidnaps the girl.

1476
02:11:02,217 --> 02:11:04,500
The kidnappers do not take the
girl to her house, Inspector.

1477
02:11:04,753 --> 02:11:06,553
They take them out of their homes.

1478
02:11:06,955 --> 02:11:09,553
And I brought Kaajal home.

1479
02:11:09,891 --> 02:11:12,400
I do not know anything.
Mumbai police report ..

1480
02:11:12,660 --> 02:11:15,621
... that you took part in a fight
and you kidnapped this girl.

1481
02:11:16,230 --> 02:11:17,800
They will be sent there now.

1482
02:11:18,099 --> 02:11:20,863
- Officer, arrest them.
- Listen to us.

1483
02:12:07,749 --> 02:12:09,216
Why did they push us out?

1484
02:12:32,373 --> 02:12:36,070
Come on! Come on! But do
not run away with anyone.

1485
02:12:49,390 --> 02:12:51,085
Come here! Come on!

1486
02:12:51,860 --> 02:12:54,954
Come on!

1487
02:12:55,864 --> 02:12:56,656
Hey!

1488
02:12:58,867 --> 02:12:59,999
Move on!

1489
02:13:00,567 --> 02:13:02,008
Hey! What is this?

1490
02:13:05,006 --> 02:13:07,099
This girl is dressed as a bride.

1491
02:13:07,809 --> 02:13:11,100
Hey, D'Souza! The sack
of the wedding altar?

1492
02:13:11,346 --> 02:13:13,300
If I had arrived a little later

1493
02:13:13,601 --> 02:13:15,000
..the two would already be married.

1494
02:13:15,283 --> 02:13:16,773
Curse!

1495
02:13:17,886 --> 02:13:20,677
That was wrong. That was very bad.

1496
02:13:21,356 --> 02:13:24,100
You did not let a girl
fulfill her one wish.

1497
02:13:24,559 --> 02:13:28,853
You did not let her get married. Very bad.
But there's no problem.

1498
02:13:29,364 --> 02:13:33,100
I will fulfill it. I will fulfill
your only desire of the heart.

1499
02:13:33,568 --> 02:13:35,461
I'll have her marry.
I will do it!

1500
02:13:36,905 --> 02:13:40,966
You're very affectionate about
becoming a girlfriend, right?

1501
02:13:41,309 --> 02:13:42,700
Answer me!

1502
02:13:42,911 --> 02:13:46,410
Hey! I will make you a girlfriend!
Come on, talk!

1503
02:13:49,250 --> 02:13:52,151
How will he speak? His mouth is covered.

1504
02:13:52,520 --> 02:13:56,149
Hey! Take out the gag. Quick!

1505
02:13:56,657 --> 02:13:58,000
She will be a girlfriend

1506
02:13:58,259 --> 02:14:01,228
I will make you a girlfriend! Now talk!

1507
02:14:02,864 --> 02:14:05,025
The bride of whom you will be? Speaks!

1508
02:14:09,070 --> 02:14:10,162
His?

1509
02:14:11,472 --> 02:14:13,440
That will not do you any good.

1510
02:14:14,208 --> 02:14:16,738
You will be a widow
before your henna dries.

1511
02:14:17,578 --> 02:14:19,171
Find another!

1512
02:14:23,951 --> 02:14:26,042
What do you think of this bare?

1513
02:14:27,021 --> 02:14:30,513
Do not? Curse. Come here! Get off!

1514
02:14:31,092 --> 02:14:33,356
What do you think of this fat man?

1515
02:14:35,096 --> 02:14:37,189
And this short?

1516
02:14:38,499 --> 02:14:40,194
Do not? Come here.

1517
02:14:40,568 --> 02:14:41,570
Yes!

1518
02:14:43,368 --> 02:14:44,270
Jaggu!

1519
02:14:44,768 --> 02:14:48,270
Yes, he is perfect. The idiot still
weeps in mourning for his sister.

1520
02:14:48,609 --> 02:14:51,209
He will overcome his pain! What if!

1521
02:14:52,999 --> 02:14:54,509
The idiot is also a pimp.

1522
02:14:55,716 --> 02:14:58,383
Your child will also follow in his footsteps.

1523
02:14:59,988 --> 02:15:04,550
And gradually, you will
start a brothel like me.

1524
02:15:05,259 --> 02:15:08,285
Chote, make arrangements
for the sequel.

1525
02:15:08,997 --> 02:15:10,900
And do not forget the music.

1526
02:15:11,132 --> 02:15:13,698
What if! Get a priest
to marry them.

1527
02:15:14,002 --> 02:15:16,095
And here we will put a tent!

1528
02:15:16,404 --> 02:15:18,565
Because our "Laila and Majnu"
they marry. (Old love story)

1529
02:15:19,007 --> 02:15:20,106
Why..

1530
02:15:20,307 --> 02:15:22,406
It should be a big
wedding, right?

1531
02:15:23,644 --> 02:15:25,500
All brothels should be
witnesses to this, right?

1532
02:15:25,713 --> 02:15:27,881
The wedding is serious, boss?

1533
02:15:29,750 --> 02:15:31,575
Dhanraj never jokes!

1534
02:15:32,020 --> 02:15:35,251
She will marry and everyone will see!

1535
02:15:35,823 --> 02:15:38,922
Curse. She will marry a pimp!

1536
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:41,821
And a dozen boyfriends spend
their night with her!

1537
02:15:43,631 --> 02:15:46,832
Hey, call our
important customers.

1538
02:15:47,168 --> 02:15:48,800
And ask them to come
and bid the price.

1539
02:15:49,037 --> 02:15:51,305
Dhanraj! What madness is this ?!

1540
02:15:57,512 --> 02:15:59,480
What does Madam Leela think?

1541
02:16:00,181 --> 02:16:02,479
That I'm not going
crazy for all this?

1542
02:16:03,051 --> 02:16:05,019
I'm freaking out in anger!

1543
02:16:05,319 --> 02:16:07,480
Wear it and dress it like a bride!

1544
02:16:08,189 --> 02:16:10,955
As one would dress a horse for
an auction in the market!

1545
02:16:11,192 --> 02:16:15,200
Otherwise, there will be
so many dead bodies here.

1546
02:16:15,963 --> 02:16:17,100
..which will be difficult to count.

1547
02:16:17,398 --> 02:16:21,160
Do not kill anyone boss, or I will not
be able to deal with the problem.

1548
02:16:23,204 --> 02:16:24,100
What?

1549
02:16:25,704 --> 02:16:27,600
Can not you take care of the problem?

1550
02:16:28,342 --> 02:16:29,800
What will you do?

1551
02:16:30,378 --> 02:16:32,171
I take care of you all my life.

1552
02:16:34,020 --> 02:16:35,000
Release it.

1553
02:16:40,088 --> 02:16:42,181
Go! Go away!

1554
02:16:42,690 --> 02:16:44,400
- Chief, please.
- Get out.

1555
02:16:44,825 --> 02:16:46,620
Do not try to get me information!

1556
02:16:51,566 --> 02:16:55,592
Those standing near the door
and windows, listen well.

1557
02:16:56,104 --> 02:17:00,006
Look how Dhanraj tear the tongue
out of those who bark at him!

1558
02:17:00,775 --> 02:17:02,868
And break the teeth of
those who bite him!

1559
02:17:03,111 --> 02:17:05,300
After seeing how they
are both punished ..

1560
02:17:05,780 --> 02:17:08,600
No girl dared to
escape from here!

1561
02:17:08,983 --> 02:17:10,016
Chote.

1562
02:17:11,586 --> 02:17:14,700
Cut this lover in
small pieces ..

1563
02:17:15,322 --> 02:17:17,213
..and put it in the
freezer of our factory.

1564
02:17:17,658 --> 02:17:21,355
Thus his love turns to ice.
Come on.

1565
02:17:21,958 --> 02:17:23,655
- Grab him.
- Dhanraj!

1566
02:17:37,612 --> 02:17:40,376
Dhanraj, I will not let you
commit this injustice!

1567
02:17:40,748 --> 02:17:42,300
They really love each other.

1568
02:17:42,550 --> 02:17:45,041
Let them go! Do
not do the curse!

1569
02:17:47,622 --> 02:17:50,648
You cheated on me! You dishonored me!

1570
02:17:51,159 --> 02:17:53,900
You pushed me here.
Now, if you kill me ..

1571
02:17:54,162 --> 02:17:57,400
..I will not feel bad. But
do not curse two lovers!

1572
02:17:57,632 --> 02:17:59,657
Do not incur the curse.
Release them.

1573
02:18:07,241 --> 02:18:09,072
Madam Leela!

1574
02:18:15,641 --> 02:18:17,872
Dhanraj!

1575
02:18:31,332 --> 02:18:34,426
Go and dress her like a bride.

1576
02:18:35,636 --> 02:18:38,764
Do not make me angry, or you
run with the same fate.

1577
02:18:39,807 --> 02:18:43,736
You see and saw Jaggu as a boyfriend.

1578
02:18:44,745 --> 02:18:45,900
Go!

1579
02:18:46,681 --> 02:18:49,309
- We never had a wedding here.
- Come on.

1580
02:18:49,617 --> 02:18:53,451
Today, the sequel of a pimp will
come and everyone will remember me.

1581
02:18:56,224 --> 02:18:58,624
Go and look!

1582
02:19:02,697 --> 02:19:04,130
Come on, come on up.

1583
02:19:16,844 --> 02:19:18,471
Kick the idiot!

1584
02:19:19,247 --> 02:19:21,738
After he is your turn.

1585
02:19:22,383 --> 02:19:25,750
Procurer! You will be the
boyfriend after him!

1586
02:19:47,983 --> 02:19:49,750
SUSHMI!

1587
02:21:14,495 --> 02:21:16,861
Pardon

1588
02:21:28,843 --> 02:21:34,600
Beloved, oh beloved, come now.

1589
02:21:34,803 --> 02:21:42,021
Beloved, oh beloved, come now.

1590
02:21:59,540 --> 02:22:05,911
What color did our love bring?

1591
02:22:06,540 --> 02:22:12,111
What color did our love bring?

1592
02:22:12,953 --> 02:22:19,381
The moment of our meeting
became that of separation.

1593
02:22:23,553 --> 02:22:29,381
What color did our love bring?

1594
02:22:29,953 --> 02:22:36,281
The moment of our meeting
became that of separation.

1595
02:22:38,979 --> 02:22:46,200
Every time your thought comes,
it makes my heart cry a lot.

1596
02:22:46,454 --> 02:22:53,200
How will I live without you? Come and tell me.

1597
02:22:53,461 --> 02:22:59,700
Beloved, oh beloved, come now.

1598
02:22:59,961 --> 02:23:06,657
Beloved, oh beloved, come now.

1599
02:23:32,500 --> 02:23:35,799
Hey! Stop! Stop!

1600
02:23:39,907 --> 02:23:41,397
- Mr. Colonel.
- What happens?

1601
02:23:41,607 --> 02:23:42,397
Come on.

1602
02:23:45,513 --> 02:23:48,140
- Who are you?
- We are friends of Saajan.

1603
02:23:48,375 --> 02:23:50,500
Friends of Saajan?
Saajan is in Ooty.

1604
02:23:50,718 --> 02:23:53,000
Saajan is not in Ooty, sir.
She was getting married

1605
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:55,500
.. when the police arrested us all
and pushed us out of the van.

1606
02:23:55,723 --> 02:23:57,300
And they took Saajan and Kaajal.

1607
02:23:57,525 --> 02:23:59,100
When we went to the Ooty
Commissary, we found out ..

1608
02:23:59,326 --> 02:24:01,000
- they never arrested Saajan.
- What does it mean?

1609
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:03,300
It means that Dhanraj's men
came in disguised as cops.

1610
02:24:03,531 --> 02:24:04,700
And they have them here.

1611
02:24:04,999 --> 02:24:07,000
Dhanraj will kill them, sir! Salvelos!

1612
02:24:07,234 --> 02:24:08,829
They must be in the brothel, sir.

1613
02:24:09,803 --> 02:24:12,433
- In the brothel of Dhanraj?
Yes.

1614
02:24:13,341 --> 02:24:16,200
But... I'm in uniform.
I will change and I will go.

1615
02:24:16,543 --> 02:24:19,300
Sir, this uniform is
used to protect lives.

1616
02:24:19,547 --> 02:24:21,640
And now two lives are in danger!

1617
02:24:22,282 --> 02:24:24,299
The life of Saajan and
Kaajal is in danger ..

1618
02:24:25,753 --> 02:24:26,645
Do not!

1619
02:24:27,353 --> 02:24:28,645
Go Go!

1620
02:24:52,612 --> 02:24:53,477
Come on.

1621
02:24:55,583 --> 02:24:56,511
Come on.

1622
02:25:10,598 --> 02:25:11,426
Where is Chote?

1623
02:25:19,607 --> 02:25:20,699
Where is Chote?

1624
02:25:22,610 --> 02:25:24,043
Hey! Where is Chote? Chote?

1625
02:25:30,618 --> 02:25:32,518
Hey! Where is Chote?

1626
02:25:34,755 --> 02:25:35,847
Where is Chote?

1627
02:25:39,159 --> 02:25:40,524
Where is Chote?

1628
02:25:41,762 --> 02:25:43,525
Damn pimp! Where is Chote?

1629
02:25:51,562 --> 02:25:52,525
Saajan!

1630
02:25:58,646 --> 02:26:02,605
Aside! He is mine! Curse.

1631
02:26:12,660 --> 02:26:13,588
Do not!

1632
02:26:15,462 --> 02:26:18,891
Leave Dhanraj, Saajan.
Or I shoot her.

1633
02:26:24,805 --> 02:26:25,897
Dog!

1634
02:26:27,675 --> 02:26:28,903
Where is Chote?

1635
02:26:30,210 --> 02:26:32,305
Where is my brother Chote?

1636
02:26:32,680 --> 02:26:33,977
Where is my brother Chote?

1637
02:26:47,630 --> 02:26:48,677
Saajan!

1638
02:27:30,338 --> 02:27:31,966
I'm here boy!

1639
02:27:32,868 --> 02:27:34,006
Yes sir!

1640
02:27:41,281 --> 02:27:43,249
You right, you left,
you see over there!

1641
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:45,909
OK sir!

1642
02:27:51,759 --> 02:27:53,659
- Let go!
- No, I will not.

1643
02:28:08,776 --> 02:28:12,803
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

1644
02:28:52,976 --> 02:28:54,403
Saajan!

1645
02:29:11,251 --> 02:29:12,043
Tempo!

1646
02:29:23,851 --> 02:29:24,743
Stop!

1647
02:29:31,951 --> 02:29:32,843
Buddha!

1648
02:29:40,651 --> 02:29:41,643
Refill!

1649
02:30:08,428 --> 02:30:10,862
Do not!

1650
02:30:28,628 --> 02:30:29,762
Mr!

1651
02:30:33,186 --> 02:30:36,817
Lord, get up. Sir,
please stand up.

1652
02:30:37,190 --> 02:30:40,421
Sir, I love him very much.
Please do not leave us.

1653
02:30:40,928 --> 02:30:44,989
Lord, I'll do what you want. Say

1654
02:30:48,628 --> 02:30:50,289
I want it, sir.

1655
02:30:51,628 --> 02:30:52,589
Mr!

1656
02:30:54,474 --> 02:30:55,839
Unfortunate.

1657
02:30:56,476 --> 02:30:58,800
A small bullet ..

1658
02:30:59,609 --> 02:31:02,800
.. can not harm Colonel Sood
of the Rajputana regiment.

1659
02:31:03,009 --> 02:31:04,010
Yes, sir, yes.

1660
02:31:04,952 --> 02:31:06,920
Come on, come on, give me your hand.

1661
02:31:26,352 --> 02:31:27,520
Colonel Sood.

1662
02:31:28,308 --> 02:31:30,738
We have been looking for this
D'Souza for a long time.

1663
02:31:31,378 --> 02:31:34,109
He was an impostor inspector
working for Dhanraj.

1664
02:31:34,514 --> 02:31:39,213
Today, these girls
got their freedom.

1665
02:31:39,619 --> 02:31:42,215
You mean my son did
not do anything?

1666
02:31:43,123 --> 02:31:46,217
My son should receive a prize.

1667
02:31:47,127 --> 02:31:50,426
Lord, I did all this out of love.

1668
02:31:51,131 --> 02:31:54,165
And in the name of love, only you.
You can give me a prize, sir.

1669
02:31:54,531 --> 02:31:55,265
Mr?

1670
02:31:56,003 --> 02:31:58,096
No, not son.

1671
02:32:00,003 --> 02:32:00,996
Daddy.

1672
02:32:01,203 --> 02:32:02,500
- Daddy?
- Daddy.

1673
02:32:03,003 --> 02:32:03,996
Daddy!

1674
02:32:05,012 --> 02:32:06,104
Mom?

1675
02:32:09,312 --> 02:32:10,104
Daddy.

1676
02:32:12,019 --> 02:32:13,000
Mom.

1677
02:32:16,519 --> 02:32:17,400
It's okay.

1678
02:32:27,319 --> 02:32:28,200
Kaajal?

1679
02:32:29,619 --> 02:32:31,200
- Kaajal?
- Go for it son.

1680
02:32:31,619 --> 02:32:32,600
Yes sir!

1681
02:33:16,616 --> 02:33:20,575
Let me decorate this
part of your hair ..

1682
02:33:21,616 --> 02:33:25,320
Commander, and the commander's lady.
Come, we must go.

It feels good.

1686

The dream of love ..

You reside in my heart.

You are my happiness.

1696

Without you, I do not want
to live a single moment.
