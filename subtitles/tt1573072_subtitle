1
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,327
Players win.
- Yeah!

2
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:47,767
Bad night.

3
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,702
48..
- That's mine. - Yeah!

4
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,077
Yes!

5
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,514
Send in the cooler.

6
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:11,886
Oh..
- Security. Security. - Yes.

7
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,966
All the air conditioners
in the casino are on..

8
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,365
..yet the boss has ordered
for a cooler on the phone.

9
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,960
This isn't a cooler for
cooling down the place.

10
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:23,065
A cooler is a man who is
summoned by the casino..

11
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,974
..when the casino is
losing and people are winning.

12
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,739
ls he a player?
- He's no player.

13
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,715
He's jinxed.
Unfortunate. He is bad-luck.

14
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,876
Just watch.

15
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,815
As soon as he enters..

16
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,786
..and as he passes by every table..

17
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,723
..winning streaks will
turn to losing streaks.

18
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,953
Their happiness will
turn to sorrow.

19
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,995
And our casino will
start winning again.

20
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:47,498
He's coming.
- Oh God. ls he such a bad omen?

21
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,730
Notjust bad, he's the
worst kind of bad luck ever.

22
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,066
Come on.

23
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,636
''His fate is always making him cry.''

24
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:02,478
''There's no way he can
get rid of his bad luck.''

25
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:11,056
''Life doesn't bestow
him with anything.''

26
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:15,692
''lnstead it keeps
taking things away.''

27
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,888
''He's such bad-luck.''

28
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:20,465
''He's such bad-luck.''

29
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,727
''You'd never have come
across a loser like him.''

30
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,771
''He's such a loser.''

31
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,171
''He's such a loser.''

32
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:33,535
''He's such a.. such a loser.''

33
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,841
''He's such a loser.''

34
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,144
''He's such a loser.''

35
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:43,152
''He's such a.. such a loser.''

36
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,097
Oh no..

37
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:02,071
''Friday the 13th is a bad omen.''

38
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:07,112
''But it's no match
for his birthday.''

39
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:15,920
''He's jinxed, that's his fate.''

40
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:20,482
''He's the worst kind of bad luck.''

41
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,026
''He's such bad-luck.''

42
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,494
''He's such bad-luck.''

43
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:28,562
''You'd never have come
across a loser like him.''

44
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,829
''He's such a loser.''

45
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,531
''He's such a loser.''

46
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:37,641
''He's such a.. such a loser.''

47
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,803
''He's such a loser.''

48
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,607
''He's such a loser.''

49
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,273
''He's such a.. such a loser.''

50
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,281
Aarush, l don't understand.

51
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:52,086
Why do you look so upset
whenever you come to the casino?

52
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,626
People lose every time l come here.

53
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,826
And l realise l'm such a loser.

54
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,661
Why don't you take up a job?

55
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,268
Because where ever l take up a job..

56
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:09,939
..l get fired
because of my ominous fate.

57
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,645
But the casino is the only place..

58
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:16,779
..where l get paid for my bad luck.

59
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,278
How long will this continue?

60
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,945
That's it! Today's the last day.

61
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:25,214
After today everything will change.
- How is that?

62
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,816
Because it's my destiny..

63
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,953
The day l marry my true love..

64
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,664
..good fortune will
smile upon me again.

65
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,927
Look. And that day isn't far.

66
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,173
l'm going to propose to Puja.

67
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,668
Puja, will you marry me?

68
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:48,269
No, l cannot marry you.

69
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:53,082
Why? What's wrong with me?
- Everything.

70
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,986
Since you've come into my
life everything has gone wrong.

71
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,615
l've met with an accident six times.

72
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,284
l've lost my job.

73
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,021
l've lost my friends.

74
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,994
And you know what
happened yesterday.

75
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,123
l lost some of my hair as well.

76
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,932
Listen, Aarush, you're very sweet.

77
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,269
But you're jinxed.

78
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,035
When l told my brother about you..

79
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:20,135
..he said it as well, that
a man who makes a living..

80
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,714
..from his bad-luck
can't be good for me.

81
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:26,307
And anyway, he has finalised
my marriage with someone else.

82
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:31,015
''He keeps wishing for true love.''

83
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:35,618
''lnstead, life gives him nothing.''

84
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:40,165
''He asks a girl,
''marry me, my baby.''

85
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:44,794
''She replies,
over my dead body, maybe.''

86
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:45,962
''He's such bad-luck.''

87
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,131
''He's such bad-luck.''

88
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:53,036
''You'd never have come
across a loser like him.''

89
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,977
''He's such a loser.''

90
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,946
''He's such a loser.''

91
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,884
''He's such a.. such a loser.''

92
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,149
''He's such a loser.''

93
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,953
''He's such a loser.''

94
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,096
''He's such a.. such a loser.''

95
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,357
''He's such a loser.''

96
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,724
''He's such a loser.''

97
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:20,103
''He's such a.. such a loser.''

98
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,398
''He's such a loser.''

99
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,937
''He's such a loser.''

100
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:29,681
''He's such a.. such a loser.''

101
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,080
''He's such a loser.''

102
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,716
Puja. Puja.

103
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,217
Puja.

104
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,955
Puja, open the door.

105
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:46,760
Puja..

106
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,473
Stay away from my sister, get it.

107
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,348
Bloody loser.

108
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:12,315
''Loser.''

109
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,366
Aarush.

110
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,739
Brother, you're leaving?

111
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,470
Yes.

112
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,907
l think Macau wasn't lucky for you.

113
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:40,981
The entire world is unlucky for me.

114
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,520
Where will you go?

115
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:44,981
There's only one man in the world..

116
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,786
..who doesn't think that l'm a jinx.

117
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:52,392
We grew up together in London,
worked together in London.

118
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,194
He always thought it
was his good fortune

119
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,201
..to be the best friend of
an unfortunate man like me.

120
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,793
l'm going back to him.

121
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:02,270
l'm going back home.
l'm going to London.

122
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:10,081
1 7, everybody's a winner.

123
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,148
Stop checking him out.
- He's cute.

124
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,248
You will never change.

125
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,447
Whatever, l'm off now.
- Off?

126
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:22,017
Yeah. l need to look after my baby.
- Good luck.

127
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:25,894
Ladies and gentlemen,
most of you know me.

128
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:30,326
l'm Kishore Samtani, the
owner of this fabulous casino.

129
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,933
And now l'm going to speak in Hindi.

130
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,874
Because whenever l speak in Hindi,
you don't understand.

131
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,309
And you clap even when l abuse you.

132
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,313
For 200 years,
you looted my country.

133
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,417
So l came to London
and opened this casino..

134
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:52,923
..to loot you scoundrels.
Clap, applause, applause.

135
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,255
Applause.. l love you, guys.

136
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:59,928
Boys and girls, the

To celebrate the

Babu Rao to Hetal.

139
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:11,236
All the drinks are on me.
Drink, play, and lose.

00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,880
For being my wife.

142
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,607
Your father hasn't spoken to you..

143
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,885
..for the past two
years because of me.

144
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,422

We've been married for two years.

163
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:26,346
Shameless.

164
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,951
There's a surprise for you,

So come up after a short while.

Because soon Victoria's
secret won't be a secret anymore.

168
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,497
Victoria!

169
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:49,565

Lingerie!

171
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,876
Hey, why dancing? Open my cage once,
l'll come and hit you.

172
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,963
My cutie pie.

173

Under the blanket.. ls my wife.

You've worn lingerie for me.

177
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,326
And l'll gift you a Cartier
watch for your slender wrist

178
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:50,468
And a Gucci bag for
your arms to carry.

179
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:58,509
And for your lovely cheeks,
a Gillette razor.

180
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,340
Gillette razor?

181
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:07,577
You!

182
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,723
Who is he?
- Hetal, this is my friend Aarush.

183
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,123
Hello.

184
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,353
Aarush, this is my wife Hetal.

185
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,554
What is he doing in our bed?

186
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,028
Aarush, close your eyes.

187
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,299
Close your eyes and not mine.
- Sorry.

188
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,335
What's he doing in our bed?
- Sorry baby. Baby.

189
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,101
Why is it so quiet?

190
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:39,314
Bob, did your wife go inside?

191
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,685
Did your wife go inside?
- No, she went out.

192
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:49,318
Thank God.

193
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:53,622
She went out the window.
- Oh God. - Come on, hurry up.

194
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,597
Baby, he's my best friend.
- Friend!

195
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,430
Friends don't come
uninvited like this.

196
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,505
And even if they do, they
don't barge inside the house.

197
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,198
And even if they do barge in
they don't go sleep on the bed.

198
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:06,802
Please, Hetal, l know
he's slightly stupid.

199
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,773
But he's a really sweet guy.

200
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,746
He's simple, has a heart of gold.

201
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,579
lt's just a matter of..
one or two days.

202
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:14,477
Just for..

203
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,256
l've cleaned up the broken windows..

204
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,557
..and cleared up all the mess. l..
- He..

205
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,780
Sister-in-law, l hope
you're not hurt too bad..

206
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,679
Actually, you must be thinking
''What kind of a friend is he..''

207
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,550
''..that he's dropped in uninvited?''

208
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,553
Sister-in-law, Bob and
l are childhood buddies

209
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:59,388
l can stay away from him for years.

210
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:04,401
But when l miss him l can't
stay away even for a second.

211
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:08,633
l just packed my Bags
and came here..

212
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,572
..for two-three weeks.

213
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,911
So that l can muster
up the courage..

214
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,577
..to handle life for
another two-three years.

215
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,677
l just want to be with him.

216
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,345
For two-three weeks?

217
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,309
Yes, Sister-in-law,
for two to three weeks.

218
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,914
Two.. th-th-three..

219
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,249
You haven't stopped stammering yet?

220
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,690
You know, Sister-in-law
he starts stammering..

221
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,193
..whenever he's stressed out.

222
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,454
And today..

223
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,663
ls there a problem?

224
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,806
l'm going to sleep. Okay?

225
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,311
Did your wife feel bad?

226
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:50,940
No.

227
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,708
Don't be silly.

228
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,447
Are you sure it's okay
if l stay here?

229
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:56,714
Of course.

230
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,820
This is your house.

231
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,521
ls two-three weeks too long?
- No.

232
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,228
lt's too little.

233
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:19,641
Baby. Baby, l'm damn
sorry for whatever happened.

234
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:24,675
Baby, so where were we?

235
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,849
You were on top of him
without your clothes on.

236
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,351
And l was right in front of
him without my clothes on.

237
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,848
Baby.. okay.

238
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,452
Where are baby's sweet hands?

239
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,619
Where are they? Where are they?

240
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,424
Oh, l found them.

241
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,628
Where are baby's lovely eyes?
Where are they? Show.

242
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:44,896
There they are.

243
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,830
Where are baby's kissable lips?

244
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,666
Where is the bathroom?

245
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,570
Where is the bathroom?

246
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,806
What.. are you doing here?

247
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,781
l was looking for the
bathroom downstairs.

248
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:58,975
l couldn't find it.

249
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:00,546
Where is the bathroom?
l need to go to the bathroom.

250
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,379
Thank you.

251
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,958
So, where were we?

252
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,287
Aarush.

253
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,728
l think he's cleaning the house.

254
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,693
To.. help you.

255
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:30,430
He's.. just trying to..
make up for yesterday.

256
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,807
That's really sweet of him.

257
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:38,874
l told you.

258
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,885
He's been very sweet,
since childhood.

259
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,962
Help! l don't want to die so soon.

260
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,728
Parrots life is in danger!
Parrots life is in danger!

261
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,099
Aarush.

262
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,072
Aarush. Aarush.

263
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,139
What have you done?

264
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,857
Stop this thing.

265
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,724
Plug.

266
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,010
What have you done to my house?

267
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,619
What have you done?

268
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,450
ls this what you call cleaning?

269
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,685
Are you crazy?

270
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,652
Oh my..

271
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,023
Prada.

272
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:37,996
Where is my Prada?

273
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:41,104
Prada, my love.

274
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,571
Where is Prada?

275
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:11,600
Get out!

276
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,828
Get out of my house!

277
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,030
Both of you!

278
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,708
What's your problem, Bob?

279
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,949
You want to compete with me?

280
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,711
You're making faces at me.

281
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:33,655
You want to fight me?

282
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,987
Got some new moves?

283
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:38,755
Show me what you got.

284
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:39,749
What happened?

285
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,118
Sorry.

286
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:45,256
You had an argument with Babu Rao.

287
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:49,795
You shouldn't argue
about such petty things.

288
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:55,163
Do you know how difficult it is to
find a nice lndian boy in England?

289
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,604
What if you lose him?

290
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:57,933
Stupid.

291
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,705
Actually, it's a very good idea.

292
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:02,905
You better leave him.

293
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,112
As it is, l'm looking for a
boy like him for my daughter.

294
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,610
l'll get Devika married
to Babu Rao.

295
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,812
She'll be extremely
happy with Babu Rao.

296
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:14,187
lf she's happy, it'll make me happy.

297
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,192
you know, for a father
there is no greaterjoy..

298
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:19,092
..than seeing his daughter happy.

299
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,797
l love my daughter. Really.

300
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,401
Clean it properly.

301
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:33,769
Clean it properly.

302
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,312
lt's a Bentley. Bentley.

303
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,676
Get to work.

304
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:37,976
What is this?

305
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,351
This is Batuk Patel
Farsan (Brand of snacks).

306
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,714
People don'tjust buy them.

307
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,082
They buy it because they
see my photo on the packet.

308
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,348
Get to work, come on.

309
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,356
Pound it properly!
Pound it properly!

310
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,019
Get to the side.

311
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,321
Greetings, sir.
- Yes, greetings.

312
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,896
Won't you greet me?

313
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,155
How else will you afford your meal?

314
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,323
lt's because of me.

315
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,695
Come on, get to work.

316
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,666
Stupid people.

317
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,734
Batuk Patel Pareshan,
talk after the beep.

318
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:09,372
Papa. How are you?

319
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:12,806
Are you fine?

320
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,886
Don't worry about me, Papa.

321
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,184
l'm absolutely fine.

322
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:21,726
Bob is a very nice guy, Papa.

323
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,795
He has opened three
new factories this year.

324
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:32,133
Made a profit of
1000 crores this year.

325
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:36,465
We have a big house,
servants at our disposal.

326
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:41,171
l miss you a lot, Papa.

327
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,817
Mummy! Mummy! Mummy!

328
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:53,982
Mummy! Why are you hitting me?

329
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,219
Mummy! Why are you hitting me?

330
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,193
You idiot.
- Mummy! Why are you hitting me?

331
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,992
Why am l hitting you? You fool,
when will you learn?

332
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,464
No matter how big a house you have..

333
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,201
..it never becomes a home
until you have a family.

334
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:06,429
We have a family.

335
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:10,167
You, me, the buffaloes, the
Bentley car.. That's family.

336
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,401
You call this family?
You call this family?

337
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,875
And what about my Hetal?

338
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,772
She's been calling
for the last two years.

339
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:20,249
''Papa, forgive me, forgive me.''

340
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,445
And you don't forgive her.

341
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:25,819
You don't even know what
your son-in-law looks like.

342
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,119
l had found a
suitable husband for her.

343
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,285
Ahmedabad's snacks king,
Ramesh Soni.

344
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:33,455
You know, he owns the
biggest bungalow in Ahmedabad.

345
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:36,227
And Hetal, she went
to London to study.

346
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,325
And she got married to
that stammering waiter.

347
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:39,801
l will never forgive her.

348
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:42,470
Are you a father
or an estate agent?

349
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:45,099
Harping about bungalows.
You were born in a ghetto.

350
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,337
You can tie me up. Skin me alive.

351
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:48,810
Throw me into the ocean.

352
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,974
But l will never
forgive her or her husband.

353
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,141
You won't forgive her?
- No.

354
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:55,811
You won't forgive her?
- No. No, no.

355
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,445
Mummy! Mummy! Mummy!
- You idiot.

356
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,150
What are you watching?
Get back to your work.

357
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,892
Come on, get back to you work.
This is their daily episode.

358
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,157
l don't care
if he's your best friend.

359
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:07,788
Do whatever you want to.

360
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,868
lf you don't throw him
out of the house today..

361
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,097
l don't believe this.

362
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:09,525
l know you can't forgive me.
You have Bob, your own family

363
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:16,866
But, for a while, l forgot
that all l had was my bad luck.

364
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:22,431
l'm sorry.

365
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,413
Look after yourself, okay.

366
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:39,347
l'm leaving.

367
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:53,899
Aarush.

368
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,607
Unfortunate is someone
who doesn't have a family.

369
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:12,284
l am the one who has forgotten
how to behave around family..

370
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:19,128
lf you leave today, Aarush..

371
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,122
..we'll be the unfortunate ones.

372
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,627
Please, don't go.

373
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:44,680

Yes.
- Where? - He's inside.

377
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,488
Prada.

378
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:51,653
Where is my Prada?

379
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,993
Are you ready?
- Yes. - Are you ready?

380
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,293
Yes, come on.

381
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,697
Okay. Count.

00:28:57,001 --> 00:29:00,664
Three.. two.. one..

Prada. Prada. Hurry up.

384
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,681
Ladies and gentlemen,
l present Prada.

385
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,258
Prada was a parrot. This is a..

386
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,088
Yes, this was the only animal
available by the name of Prada.

387
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:26,595
So l got this.
- Where did you get him from?

388
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,165
From the 'Sher Bazaar'
(Tiger market).

389
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,563
Stay.. stay away.

390
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,259
He'll devour you.
- No, he won't.

391
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,735
He's a vegetarian.

392
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:35,198
Look..

393
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:36,398
No need to be scared.

394
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:37,566
Sister-in-law, come here.

395
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:38,767
Stay away. Stay away.

396
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,772
Come, Sister-in-law,
don't be.. l assure you.

397
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,273
Just a minute,
let me close the door.

398
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,438
Or else it might get
scared and run out.

399
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:44,606
Don't close it.
- No! No!

400
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:47,014
You'll be absolutely alright.

401
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:49,144
Open the door.

402
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,687
Listen to me. Listen to me.

403
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,416
You'll be absolutely fine.

404
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:54,116
We have to befriend him.
- l don't want to befriend him.

405
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:55,283
We have to befriend him.

406
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:57,088
He's not worth enmity.

407
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:58,355
To hell with friendship!

408
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,725
Come sister-in-law..
- l don't want to befriend him.

409
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:02,664
Come on. You'll be absolutely fine.
- Come on.

410
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,598
Sit. Sit.
- No..

411
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:06,468
You'll be absolutely fine.

412
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,163
You'll be absolutely fine.

413
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:11,037
Prada, read out a poem. Quickly.

414
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:13,642
Not the small one, the big one.

415
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,337
Loudly.

416
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,176
There's no need to scream.

417
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,046
Listen to me. Listen to me.

418
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,209
Listen to me.

419
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,616
Listen to me.

420
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,387
Listen to me.

421
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:33,294
Be quiet or you'll scare him.
Tigerrrrrrrrrrr..

422
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,199
You were born and
brought up in London..

423
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:39,429
..makes sense if you
marry a girl from here.

424
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:40,595
l think it's a good idea.

425
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:44,664
Arrange marriage with
your boss's daughter?

426
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,440
l don't think it's a good idea.

427
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,273
Come on, let's go home. - What?
- No, Aarush. - Let's go home.

428
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:49,437
Aarush.

429
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,708
Who is asking you to get married?
- At least meet her. - Yes.

430
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,515
And we're your family, isn't it?
- Yes.

431
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:58,078
So trust us. - All the girls
you loved broke your heart.

432
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,817
What was the use?
Devika is a very nice girl. - Yeah.

433
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,319
Your life will be set.

434
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,687
Hi, boys.
- Hello.

435
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:07,321
Hi, sir.
- He's your boss? - Yes.

436
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:08,590
Come.

437
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,398
Have some lovely chicken wings.
- Okay.

438
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:13,402
Chicken wings, for you.
Chicken wings. - No thanks.

439
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:14,562
Sir, l'm a vegetarian.

440
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,833
Vegetarian?
What are you doing here?

441
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,209
Sit outside and eat with my driver.
- No..

442
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,777
Don't waste my money in
a very expensive place.

443
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,847
Sir, he's Aarush.

444
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,114
Didn't l tell you? For Devika.

445

- Very good.

450
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:36,123
Good boy. Good boy.

451
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:37,654
Would you like fritters?

452
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:41,289
Sir, where's Devika?
- Devika.

453
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:42,898
There she is.

454
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:46,193
The one in the golden dress.

455
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:47,768
She's Devika?

456
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,605
That's some old hag.

457
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:51,868
There's my beautiful daughter.

458
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,700
Come, my darling. Come, come.

459
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,691

00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:11,727
Hi, Devika.

Hello.
- Hello.

463
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,364
Why are you two greeting
each other like old people?

464
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:18,230
Shake hands, come on.

465
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:20,562
Come on, come on.

466
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:23,232
You people go and chat.

Get to know each other.
l like him.

468
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,535
He's a traditional lndian boy.

469
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:28,774
Come along.
- You go.

470
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,711
Come.
- Excuse me.

471
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:32,942
One champagne bottle please, quick.

472
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,389
Would you like to eat anything?
Chicken wings, or anything else..

473
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:46,554
Chicken?
- Yes.

474
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,627
No, today is Tuesday.

475
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,332
You're fasting as well.

476
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,933
You don't seem like
you've been raised in London.

477
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:58,833
What do you mean?

478
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:03,440
l mean this
traditional attire, the bangles.

479
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,846
A 'Bindi' (Forehead dot)
would've done the trick.

480
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:10,253
Why not? A real woman is
always covered from head to toe.

481
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,793
You have such beautiful thoughts.

482
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:21,324
Do you believe in arranged
marriages and not love marriages?

483
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:24,958
l believe in love,
but after marriage.

484
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,965
l believe that God has
made a match for everyone.

485
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:32,675
And we'll surely meet
someone who'll change our fate.

486
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:39,249
You're so sweet.
- You too.

487
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:44,612
What have you decided?

488
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,318
Should l consider it to be a yes?

489
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,919
Oh..
- Consider it to be.

490
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,257
They're blushing.
That means it's a yes.

491
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,564
Wonderful! Wonderful!

492
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:55,262
Here, have chips.

493
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:56,694
Why chips?

494
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:58,833
lt's Tuesday.

495
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:00,460
Vegetarian couple. Vegetarian.

496
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,436

497
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,441
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

498
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,009
Congratulations, sir.

499
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:53,421
Today, thanks to the both of you
an unlucky man's fate has changed.

500
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:14,477
You know, Son-in-law,
you're a very lucky man

501
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:17,007
Your fate is going to thus change

502
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,015
Now Devika is yours.

503
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,484
So are her
responsibilities and her happiness.

00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,748
And so is her 500 million pounds.

Have fun, sonny.

506
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,855
Bye. Bye.

romantic place in the world.

She hasn't done anything in these.

Your wife is with
someone else on your honeymoon.

659

But.. why did you marry me?

665
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:43,072
Because papa was adamant on
getting me married to an lndian boy.

666
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:46,602
l would've got my share of the
property on only one condition.

667
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:49,145
lf l marry an lndian boy.

668
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:52,676
He showed me to at

00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:56,284
l found you the
sweetest of them all.

670
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:59,747
l thought you'd
understand if l spoke to you.

671
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:01,354
Aarush, please don't cry.

672
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:02,719
l'm very sorry.

673
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:07,554
You could've explained
this before the wedding.

674
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:10,633
l'm sorry, but we
couldn't take a chance.

675
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:13,635
What.. what will l do here?

676
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:15,637
Wait here for two weeks.

677
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,700
Legally, my share of the property
will be transferred in my name..

678
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:19,070
..and l will divorce you.

679
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:20,234
lf you want, l can even
give you a million pounds..

680
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:21,402
..and we can sort it out that way.

681
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:26,174
l'm sorry.

682
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,181
But.. we're so in love.

683
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:34,088
Aarush, please..
l didn't have any other option.

684
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:35,749
l understand, l understand.

685
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:37,617
Thank you so much,
Aarush, thank you.

686
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:38,786
Okay.

687
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,299
Aarush, you're the
sweetest man l know.

688
00:46:57,181 --> 00:47:01,675
''Look at his wife.''

689
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:06,279
''She made his life a mess.''

690
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:10,793
''The matter got worse.''

691
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:15,258
''His world was destroyed
before he was settled''

692
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:16,696
''He's such bad-luck.''

693
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,462
''He's such bad-luck.''

694
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:23,467
''You'd never have come
across a loser like him.''

695
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,735
''He's such a loser.''

696
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,141
''He's such a loser.''

697
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:32,781
''He's such a.. such a loser.''

698
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:34,612
''He's such a loser.''

699
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,177
''He's such a loser.''

700
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:41,722
''He's such a.. such a loser.''

701
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:46,626
''He's such a loser.'' What a loser.''
- Oh God.

702
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:50,199
Why did you play such a game with me?

703
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:53,426
My bad luck life is
in your hands.

704
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:57,098
l want to die.

705
00:47:57,274 --> 00:48:00,402
God, all l asked you
for was true love.

706
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,809
But all you gave me was bad luck.

707
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:05,373
Bad luck.

708
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:07,614
You turned me into a jinx.

709
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,683
l'm coming to You.

710
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:13,823
l'm coming. l'm coming. l'm coming.

711
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:01,662
Oh God, he's not breathing.

712
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:10,771
What the hell!

713
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:12,246
Pervert.

714
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:15,182
l'm trying to save you
and you're kissing me.

715
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:16,644
Sick.

716
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:37,871
Maria baby, l'll see you later in 3D.
- 3D?

717
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,533
3D, my room number.

718
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,873
This drink is free. l'm joking.

719
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,276
Come on, go.

720
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,348
Pasta, give me a cold drink,
my head is fuming.

721
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:48,612
Sandy baby, why are you so angry?
Have a cold drink.

722
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:50,710
l just saved a man from drowning.

723
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,345
And just when l was
giving him mouth-to-mouth..

724
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:53,889
..do you know what he did?
- What?

725
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,256
He kissed me.
- That's terrible.

726
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:58,919
Exactly.
- No.

727
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:01,896
Someone drowning right in front of
my hotel and l don't know about it.

728
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,523
That is terrible.

729
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:05,260
l would've called
the media, the press.

730
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:06,631
My hotel would've got publicity.

731
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:09,604
My hotel would've become the
most famous hotel in ltaly.

732
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:12,800
Pasta, that's not funny.
- Come on.

733
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,742
Oh, my God, Pasta.

734
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,675
That's him. Disgusting pervert.

735
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:20,716
That man wearing the tie.

736
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,011
He's not a pervert.

737
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,014
He's an unfortunate man.

738
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:25,879
His life is filled with tragedy.

739
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:27,718
No love, no amore.

740
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:30,816
Do you know what happened with him?
- No.

741
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:34,556
On the night of his honeymoon,
his wife left him.

742
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,563
Obviously, who would
live with such a pervert?

743
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:40,568
No, no. His wife left him forever.

744
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:44,401
She passed away.

745
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:46,603
She's dead.

746
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:50,339
Dead and gone. His wife is dead.

747
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:54,884
Oh God, Pasta,
and l slapped that man.

748
00:50:57,954 --> 00:50:59,979
l'm joking.

749
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:04,992
No, l'm here to say sorry.

750
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:07,961
Why are you apologizing?

751
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,865
l should be saying sorry.

752
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:13,925
And if you're apologizing for
that delicate slap please don't.

753
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:18,738
Because fate has
entitled me to a lot more.

754
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:22,472
l know.
- l know?

755
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:28,449
Yes, Aakhri Pasta told
me about the tragedy..

756
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:32,712
Then the whole of ltaly might know..

757
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,353
..why l was trying
to commit suicide.

758
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:37,359
Don't make such a mistake.

759
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:39,529
You never know that your
future might be much better..

760
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:41,062
..than your present.

761
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:46,466
You talk very sweetly.
- Thank you.

762
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:50,997
By the way, can l say
another sweet thing? - Yes.

763
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:53,776
Will you have lunch
with me tomorrow?

764
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:57,711
lt's my way of saying sorry.

765
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,408
Yes. My name is Aarush.

766
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:06,720
And l am Saundarya Bhagyalaxmi
Venkateshwari Basappa Rao.

767
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:10,120
ls that your name alone or
that of the entire village?

768
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:12,654
You can call me Sandy.

769
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,021
Sandy.

770
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:17,633
Very cute name.
- Thank you.

771
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:23,765
So.. we'll meet tomorrow.
- Yes, we'll meet tomorrow.

772
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:24,932
Bye.

773
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:41,947
Oh, so you live in London?

774
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:46,492
Who all are there in your family?
- No one.

775
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:47,956
l'm all alone.

776
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:49,631
Your parents?

777
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:53,599
When l was just a month old my
father was diagnosed with cancer.

778
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:56,771
God, l'm so sorry.
- No, no, it isn't like that.

779
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:01,410
After the diagnosis we learnt
that he doesn't have cancer..

780
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:02,705
..he had diabetes

781
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:05,607
Oh God. Thank God,
it was just diabetes.

782
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,741
My mummy was happy just like that.

783
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:17,584
She fed him sweets and my
father passed away right there.

784
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:26,165
My mother, she
couldn't endure this shock.

785
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:28,994
And she suffered a heart attack.

786
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:31,834
And she passed away as well.

787
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:38,012
ln two and a half
minutes flat l was orphaned.

788
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:41,580
l'm really sorry.

789
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:44,017
Even l was born in London.

790
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,783
..but my brother is based in lndia.

791
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,984
He's the head of the
lndian Military lntelligence.

792
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:52,527
Any my sister, she's married.

793
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:54,458
My phone!

794
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:55,860
The monkey took away my phone.

795
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:58,193
l'll get it back, you don't worry.
- Okay.

796
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:01,230
Monkey. Monkey.

797
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,537
Okay, monkey.
- He'll bite.

798
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:05,699
You don't worry.

799
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,672
lf he's ltalian then
l'm an lndian.

800
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:09,169
Be careful.

801
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:11,110
Give the phone back..
Go and stand there.

802
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:12,476
Don't come here.

803
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:14,883
Give the phone back.. Please.

804
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,747
Naughty monkey.

805
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:20,189
Who will you call, dear?

806
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,758
Give the phone back

807
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:27,822
Why are you insulting me?

808
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,759
Give the phone back.
l want to impress her.

809
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:32,529
Look, you've already
slapped me twice.

810
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:34,261
Give the phone back

811
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:46,748
Go. Go for it.

812
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:02,764
Thank you so much.
l don't believe this.

813
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:03,958
Here's your phone.

814
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:05,830
l won against the ltalian monkey.

815
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:08,733
Thank you.
- Kissie..

816
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:14,803
Come on, let's see who

817
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:16,879
..for this rare orchid.

818
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,972
Just like Julius
Caesar did for Cleopatra.

819
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,985
ls there anyone who can
walk on this bed of fire?

820
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:27,147
Come on, please. l beg you.

821
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:28,724
That's such a rare wild flower.

822
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:29,883
lt's beautiful.

823
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,622
l love it.

824
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,763
But who will walk on the
bed of fire for it? Come on.

825
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:36,289
Let's go.

826
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:40,864
This man walking on fire is Aarush.

827
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:45,971
Aarush.

828
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:57,713
Bob, l'm in love.
- Boss, Am l good or what?

829
00:56:57,814 --> 00:57:01,341
l've truly fallen in love for the
first time. - Am l good or what?

830
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:04,818
l'm so happy.
- Am l good or what?

831
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,286
And, Devika?

832
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:08,254
Devika is in love as well.

833
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:10,258
Am l good or what?

834
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,818
But l'm not in love with Devika.
- Am l..

835
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:16,288
What? And you?

836
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:18,060
l'm in love with someone else?

837
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:21,996
You and Devika went on your
honeymoon, isn't it? - Yes.

838
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,266
And you both fell in love.
- Yes.

839
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:26,342
But not with each other.
- No.

840
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:29,935
l'll surely lose my job.
- Am l good or what?

841
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,274
l'm in love. Bob, l'm in love.

842
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:35,317
You come to ltaly, Bob.
Come soon!

843
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:38,451
You both are very strange.

844
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:41,315
l called you once
and you both came here.

845
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:45,819
l'll get drinks for all of you.
- Okay.

846
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,021
Yes.

847
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:50,828
Kids you know..
They're all having a ball here.

848
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:55,064
You two must've supported
him a lot, isn't it?

849
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:58,066
After his wife's death.

850
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:02,872
Wife's death.
- D-d-d- eath?

851
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,446
D.. D.. drinks.

00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:07,341
This is for you. This is for you.

853
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:09,816
And this one with the
blue umbrella is for you.

854
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:12,717
And this orange one is mine.
- Thank you.

00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:17,217
Cheers.
- Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers.

856
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:22,455
He lied to her.
- Aarush never lies.

857
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:25,325
But he must have said
it to win Sandy's heart.

858
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:28,429
What are you two whispering?
- Romance, romance.

859
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:33,074
Devika is still his wife.
- She was.

860
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,273
Now Devika has a boyfriend.

861
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:36,845
They've been married for two years.

862
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:38,379
But they are still
very much in love.

863
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:39,743
Devika cheated Aarush.

864
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:43,080
He just said a small lie.
What difference does it make? - No.

865
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:48,216
What happened?
- Let's tour around ltaly.

866
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:49,484
We've been sitting here
all day. Show us ltaly.

- Good idea. - But why?

868
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,220
Why?
- Devika. - Devika?

869
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,093
There's a temple there.

870
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,530
Come on, come on.
- Let's go visit it.

871
00:58:57,834 --> 00:58:59,267
Come on, come on.
- Come on, come on.

Come, come sit with us. - Why is he
calling her here? - He's gone mad.

He has forgotten
that he has lied to her.

His wife is dead.

952
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,024
Nothing can be done now.

953
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:21,262
Sandy, we met because of her.

954
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:25,095

- My.. my boss's daughter.

- And my boss's daughter as well.

my boss's daughter.

..after you got to

961
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:40,276
lt's not your fault.

962
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:42,110
lt was my destiny that
on the honeymoon night..

963
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:44,743
Night and day you keep
talking about destiny.

964

Devika!

969
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:03,196
Those divorce papers.. speed it up.

970
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:04,532
Divorce?

971
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:07,576
Who's getting a divorce?
- Me.

972
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:14,508

But she's dead.

975

When did she die?

976
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:25,318
She's alive.

977
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:29,226
You said that she died
on the honeymoon night.

978
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,595
When did l say that?
- God!

979
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,863
And all this while
l thought your wife wasn't alive.

980
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:37,469
No.. it's as good as
not having one. - Yes.

981
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:38,631
They're getting a divorce.

982
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:40,800
She's as good as dead.
- l don't care!

983
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:42,172
lt doesn't matter
who you got married to.

984
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:44,769
Or whether you're getting a divorce!
The truth is that you lied to me.

985
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,849
And you won my heart by lying to me.

986
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:48,446
Darling, when..
- God!

987
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,178

Sandy, l love you.

01:04:59,862 --> 01:05:01,659
Disgusting.

993
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:14,635
Where are you going, Aarush?

994
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,473
ln the ocean.

995
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,807

01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:44,568
Jump, jump. Jump. Please.

01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:46,834
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1006

Wait, wait, why are you screaming?

1008
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:52,840
There's a man, he's trying
to jump from the balcony.

1009
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,179
Suicide in my hotel..

Aarush, come down.

1017
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:23,937
His name is Aarush.

He's amore, loving..
He's going to jump.

1019

Please, l request.
- Aarush?

1021
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:31,784
He could've gone
anywhere to commit suicide.

1022
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:33,616
But he chose my hotel. l told you.

1023
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:35,213
Aarush, have you gone mad?

1024
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:36,516
Why are you committing suicide?

1025
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:37,853
l'm not committing suicide.

1026
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,484
You've closed your door.

1027
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:40,822

1028
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:42,898
l've always spoken the truth.

1029
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:44,932
My wife isn't dead.

1030
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:46,592
She's alive.

1031
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:48,260
The only difference is that on
the night of our honeymoon..

1032
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:50,601
..she ditched me and
went with someone else.

1033
01:06:51,273 --> 01:06:52,865
But Pasta told me all this.

1034
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:55,443
Why do you believe him?

1035
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,543
He's always joking.

1036
01:06:58,647 --> 01:06:59,705
What should l do now?

1037
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:02,909
Save me. Pull me up. Pull harder.

1038
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:05,951
Why did the music stop?

1039
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:09,482
What?

1040
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:12,390
Security, go. Pull him,
push him, push him.

1041
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:15,325
l love you, Sandy.

1042
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,326
Now l even told the name correctly.

1043
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:25,835
Where are you going now?
- l..

1044
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:31,278
You know, l had read..

1045
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:33,939
..that when someone
saves your life..

1046
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,441
..you owe your life to him.

1047
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:39,414
Your life doesn't
belong to you anymore.

1048
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:43,552
You owe your life to me.

1049
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,887
And you don't have
the right to end it.

1050
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:53,794
l love you.

1051
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:01,971
By the way,
where did you read this?

1052
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:05,804
ln last month's Cosmo.

1053
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:08,013

1054
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:14,450

1065
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:49,056
Tell him that you have everything.

You have a big house, money.

Tell him that you've
become a mother.

1068
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,958
And he has become a grandpa.

1069
01:08:57,566 --> 01:08:58,828
Trust me, he'll just melt.

1070
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:00,893
Are you serious?

1071
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:02,934

He's just like you.

Papa, for the first time
today he said grandpa.

1078
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:32,026
Papa, at least talk to me once.

1079
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,733
Even if you want to scold me.

1080

Bye, Papa.

1081
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:51,680

To live in my
son-in-law's big bungalow.

1090
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:17,837
Okay.

1091
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:22,177
My papa is coming, Sandy.

1092
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:25,609
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1093
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:27,680
Mummy.

1094
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:29,852
Mummy, l'm a grandpa.

1095
01:10:31,093 --> 01:10:32,219
You'll still be a fool.

1096
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:34,860
Mummy, why are you hitting
me now? l'm going on the 1 7th.

1097
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:36,591
You're so stupid.

1098
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:37,825
Why are you going after five days?

1099
01:10:37,933 --> 01:10:38,991
Why aren't you going now?

1100
01:10:39,101 --> 01:10:43,538
Go now, right now, and bring
my daughter and son-in-law here.

1101
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:45,199
Mummy.

1102
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:49,067
Go on, don't waste time.

Go, go, go.

1104
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:52,905
Five days.

1105
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:54,911
Where will l get a
baby from in five days?

1106
01:10:56,885 --> 01:10:57,943
Look, l'm sorry.

1107
01:10:58,153 --> 01:11:00,053
l know l shouldn't have lied.

1108
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:06,127
But papa talked to me on
the phone because l lied.

1109
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:08,757
But, baby, why lie?

1110
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:13,731
A lie said for a
noble cause isn't a lie.

1111
01:11:13,836 --> 01:11:15,269
So sweet you are.

1112
01:11:15,971 --> 01:11:17,666
Okay, don't worry.

1113
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:19,536

01:11:20,809 --> 01:11:21,901
We'll arrange for a baby.

1115
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:23,205
Really?
- Yes.

1116
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:30,244
And, baby, a big house as well?

1117
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:33,248
ls your papa bringing the
entire village along? - No.

1118
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:38,116
Papa thinks he's a millionaire.

1119
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:43,164
How can he think that?
- l told him that.

1120
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:47,227
What? Are you.. mad?

1121
01:11:51,173 --> 01:11:52,663
Just desperate.

1122
01:11:57,913 --> 01:11:59,073
Ya.

01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:08,850
What are you saying, Brother?

1127
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:10,049
The queen of England is..

1128
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,786
..bestowing me with a
medal in the Buckingham Palace.

1129
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:13,658
Because your brother..

lipped terrorist talk..

Do you remember,
what happened with Puja?

1136
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:35,207
No, Brother, l'm not making
the mistake that sister made.

1137
01:12:36,118 --> 01:12:37,881
Brother, he's a very nice man.

1138
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,715
And he comes from a good family.

Sir.

1148

My sister was praising you a lot.
- Sir.

1149
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:17,624
But l want to see for myself..

1150
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:18,954

- Sir.

1152
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,059

01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:31,866
..you can't imagine what
l'll do to you. - Yes, sir.

01:13:35,144 --> 01:13:36,634
Just a second, hold on.

1156
01:13:41,016 --> 01:13:42,916
So now that you've
had your little break..

1157
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:45,276
..shall we continue Mr. Hudley.

1158
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:50,055
Do you have any terrorist links?

1159
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,923
l said do you have
any terrorist links?

1160
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:58,889
l said do you have any
terrorist links? - No.

1161
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,199
Liar.

1162
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:11,972
l hate liars.

1163
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:16,444
Yes, l was saying, Aarush.

1164
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:18,419
l'm coming to London on the 14th.

1165
01:14:18,987 --> 01:14:21,046
We'll see you then.
- Sir.

1166
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:22,947
Don't disappoint me.

1167
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:27,225
Sir, have a.. Sir, sir, sir.

1168
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:31,094
The phone got disconnected.

1169
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:03,488
Why did you lie to
your brother about me?

1170
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,292
Neither am l rich.

1171
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:09,199
Leave alone a mansion, l
don't even have a house.

1172
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:10,938
Why did you lie to him?

1173
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:12,933
And you know.. He's coming home.

1174
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:14,633
He'll know what the truth is.

1175
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:16,035
What's the use?

1176
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:19,180
l suggest that we call
him and tell him the truth.

1177
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:20,407
Why lie?

1178
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:23,450
You're right.
- Where are you taking me?

1179
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:24,985
Bob. Come here.

1180
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:29,617
Aarush, this is my brother.

1181
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:31,486
Major Krishna Rao.

1182
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:33,993
Head of the lndian
Military lntelligence.

1183
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:37,164
And, Brother, this is
my boyfriend Aarush.

1184
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:38,997
He's jobless at the moment.

1185
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:40,591
But he has a nice job.

1186
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:43,398
He works as a jinx at casinos.

1187
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:46,537
And Aarush stays in his home.

1188
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:49,336
And he sleeps on this couch..

1189
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:53,345
And after we get married,
l'll sleep on the carpet.

1190
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:54,574
No problem.

1191
01:15:54,983 --> 01:15:59,716
Brother.. l want to marry Aarush.

1192
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:02,650
l can't marry him at the
moment because he's married.

1193
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:05,289
But we will, after he
gets divorced. No problem.

1194
01:16:06,695 --> 01:16:09,528
Brother, l've chosen
a nice boy, isn't it?

1195
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:13,366
Brother, bless us.

1196
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:15,262
Are you ashamed of me?

1197
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:20,133
Aarush, l love you.

1198
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:22,375
But think from a
brother's point of view.

1199
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:24,739
How can l tell him the truth?

1200
01:16:25,447 --> 01:16:28,143
Why? What will go wrong
if you tell him the truth?

1201
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,445
Will he shoot me?
- Aarush, he'll kill you.

1202
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:33,248
Guys. Guys, guys,
look. Just don't stress.

1203
01:16:35,057 --> 01:16:36,524
Sandy, when is
your brother arriving?

1204
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:39,624
On the 14th.
- And when is he leaving?

1205
01:16:39,728 --> 01:16:41,059
On the 16th.

1206
01:16:42,531 --> 01:16:46,399
And papa is coming
on the 1 7th. Perfect.

1207
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:49,400
We'll call the estate agency..

1208
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:53,004
..and hire the
grandest mansion in London.

1209
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:55,208
First Sandy's brother will arrive.

1210
01:16:55,377 --> 01:16:57,140
He'll think this is Aarush's house.

1211
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:59,244
He'll be impressed
with Aarush and leave.

1212
01:16:59,581 --> 01:17:01,173
Papa will arrive on the 1 7th.

1213
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:02,545
He'll think this is your house.

1214
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:04,675
He'll be impressed
by you and leave.

1215
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:06,480
Papa will be happy.

1216
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:07,746
Your Brother will be happy.

1217
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:09,284
We'll happy.

1218
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:12,086
You know that l don't lie.

1219
01:17:12,194 --> 01:17:16,358
A lie isn't a lie if its
said for a noble cause..

1220
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:18,258
Aarush..

1221
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:21,801
What a superb plan.

1222
01:17:30,779 --> 01:17:32,041
Who is she?

1223
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:34,112
The owner of this house,
Zulekha ma'am.

1224
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:35,615
And her three millionaire husbands.

1225
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:37,712
Millionaire husbands?

1226
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:40,620
Her late husbands who left
millions behind for her.

1227
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:45,124
Zulekha ma'am has a soft
corner for old millionaires.

1228
01:17:45,627 --> 01:17:47,151
But she's so unfortunate.

1229
01:17:47,562 --> 01:17:49,792
All the three husbands passed
away on their wedding night.

1230
01:17:58,140 --> 01:17:59,573
We'll have to take
these photographs down.

1231
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,267
With whose permission do you..

1232
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:03,071
..want to take those
photographs down?

1233
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:12,220
Why is that widow
walking in slow motion?

1234
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:18,823
Hello.
- And you are?

1235
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:20,752
Ma'am, l told you about them.

1236
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:23,330
The new tenants who..
- Yes, that's fine.

1237
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:24,592
But did you tell them..

1238
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,669
..that we rent out the house
only to married couples. Right

1239
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:29,427
Are you two married?

1240
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:31,736
You're married, right?

1241
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:33,500
What?
- Yes.

1242
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:34,767
Yes, we're married.

1243
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:36,275
Then there's no problem.

1244
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:38,471
Alright. Where do l have to sign?
- Ma'am, l'll show you.. - Come.

1245
01:18:40,315 --> 01:18:41,407
Sister-in-law, another lie.

1246
01:18:41,516 --> 01:18:43,313
What difference does it make?

1247
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:50,119
A lie isn't a lie if its
said for a noble cause..

1248
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:53,122
Please, Aarush.

1249
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:54,388
Where is that written?

1250
01:18:55,831 --> 01:18:57,560
They've made me a complete liar.

1251
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:05,236
Which terminal is he arriving at?
- Three.

1252
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:06,739
Okay.
- No, four.

1253
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:10,409
No, three.
- Sandy. Why are you so stressed?

1254
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:14,138
You see.. my brother is very nice.

1255
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:15,681
But if he catches someone lying..

1256
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:18,218
..he can be extremely mean to him.

1257
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:24,187
Brother's trip has been postponed,
he isn't coming.

1258
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:26,658
What? He isn't coming?
- No. He just..

1259
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:29,491
But we've already paid
three days rent for the house.

1260
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:33,566
Praise lord Krishna.
- Krishna?

1261
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:36,562
Krishna is her brother's name.

1262
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:40,604
Brother has arrived.

1263
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:50,217
Praise Lord Krishna!
Praise Lord Krishna..

1264
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:51,683
Welcome, sir, welcome.

1265
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:53,853
You look better.

1266
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:55,382
l look better than the tree?

1267
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:56,648
No, no.

1268
01:19:56,758 --> 01:20:00,216
You look better than l thought.

1269
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:05,695
Ok. - Do you know Gujarati?
- Just a little.

1270
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,201
That's not a sin.

1271
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:10,431
lt'll do. Come on.

1272
01:20:15,443 --> 01:20:16,501
Papa.

1273
01:20:17,946 --> 01:20:19,208
Papa?

1274
01:20:20,782 --> 01:20:24,445
Sandy's brother is Hetal's father.

1275
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:28,213
That means Sandy is Hetal's aunt.

1276
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:34,620
Papa.

1277
01:20:39,034 --> 01:20:40,365
You won't talk to me.

1278
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,405
Won't you talk to me?

1279
01:20:50,612 --> 01:20:51,738
Won't you forgive me?

1280
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:56,517
You darling daughter.

1281
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,646
Your little daughter.

1282
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:02,649
My baby.
- Papa.

1283
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:07,828
My baby.

1284
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:12,466
Aarush, he's my papa.
- Hello, Mr. Krishna Rao.

1285
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:15,794
Krishna Rao? Batuk Patel.

1286
01:21:16,304 --> 01:21:17,430
Papa.

1287
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:18,767
Batuk Patel?

1288
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:19,966
Papa?
- Papa.

1289
01:21:20,075 --> 01:21:22,407
You were supposed to
arrive on the 1 7th, isn't it?

1290
01:21:22,844 --> 01:21:25,369
l couldn't resist it any longer.
So l came earlier, son-in-law.

1291
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:27,439
Son-in-law?

1292
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:29,744
Papa, he isn't my husband.

1293
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:35,647
He isn't your husband?

1294
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:39,622
He isn'tjust my husband.

1295
01:21:40,028 --> 01:21:42,963
He's also my Lord and Master.

1296
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:44,991
Yes.

1297
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:48,298
He's my Lord and Master.

1298
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:52,969
l simply adore flowers.

1299
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:00,879
Oh, my..
- My, my..

1300
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:05,714
Hello, Sister.
- l'm not your sister!!

1301
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:08,545
My name is Zulekha Bano.

1302
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:12,393
l'm absolutely alone
in this dreadful world.

1303
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:14,357
And you?
- Widower.

1304
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:19,829
Okay, Zulekha, see you.
- Why? Why?

1305
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:21,864
Papa, Zulekha is leaving.

1306
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:23,631
Who said?

1307
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:25,771
Your father is here.

1308
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:29,670
There should be someone
to look after him, right?

1309
01:22:31,413 --> 01:22:33,347
l suggest you live with us.

1310
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:34,676
Consider this your own house.

1311
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:35,977
That l do.

1312
01:22:36,084 --> 01:22:41,647
l.. l.. l.. - l was
wondering why you didn't stammer.

1313
01:22:41,756 --> 01:22:42,848
Forget it.

1314
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,949
Let's go in.
- Come on.

1315
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:48,791
No, first l'll see my grandson.

1316
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:50,023
Bring my grandson.

1317
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:51,655
He's gone for a walk, papa.

1318
01:22:51,766 --> 01:22:53,529
He goes for a walk
at such a young age.

1319
01:22:54,402 --> 01:22:55,562
The nanny is with him.

1320
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:57,968
Call the nanny.
- Lie to him again.

1321
01:22:58,073 --> 01:22:59,404
Come on. Go ahead.

1322
01:23:03,545 --> 01:23:05,513
Hello.
- Nanny.

1323
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:07,475
No, it has been postponed.

1324
01:23:07,882 --> 01:23:11,010
Wonder when he's coming next.
- My papa.

1325
01:23:11,553 --> 01:23:12,611
Oh no.

1326
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:14,552
You shouldn't talk
that way with servants.

1327
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:16,089
Give it to me. l'll talk to him.

1328
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:19,893
Nanny, bring my grandson
here quickly. - Nanny?

1329
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:23,158

- Coming.

Yes, come quickly.

That's how you talk. Here.

1332
01:23:26,801 --> 01:23:27,859
What happened?

1333
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:30,071
Papa is here.
- Papa is here?

1334
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:31,763
But he was supposed to
arrive three days later.

1335
01:23:31,873 --> 01:23:32,999
He's asking about the child.

1336
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:35,508
We'll have to organize
for a child right now.

1337
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:37,443
Where shall l get the child from?

1338
01:23:37,946 --> 01:23:41,609
Son-in-law. Who is she?

1339
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:49,620
She's your daughter.
- The one besides her.

1340
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:54,494
She.. she's.. the landlady.
- Land..

1341
01:23:56,164 --> 01:23:57,461
This isn't your house?

1342
01:24:00,769 --> 01:24:02,134
No, this is my house.

1343
01:24:02,504 --> 01:24:03,528
lt's my house.

1344
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:04,797
Then landlady.

1345
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:08,166
There's no other lady like
her in the entire land..

1346
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:12,604
That l can see.

1347
01:24:13,148 --> 01:24:14,740
Papa..

1348
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:16,983
Papa. Papa.

1349
01:24:17,218 --> 01:24:20,619
Greetings, Papa,
greetings. How are you? - Bless you.

1350
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:21,949
Son-in-law, give me your hand.

1351
01:24:23,091 --> 01:24:24,524
Son-in-law, who is he?

1352
01:24:25,994 --> 01:24:27,052
Son-in-law?

1353
01:24:29,764 --> 01:24:34,167
He's.. the.. cook.

1354
01:24:34,602 --> 01:24:37,070
Cook. But he's wearing
such expensive clothes.

1355
01:24:38,039 --> 01:24:41,668
All the cooks here
wear clothes like this.

1356
01:24:41,776 --> 01:24:45,712
English cooker..
- Cooker.

1357
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:47,709
Cooker?

1358
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:50,642
Son-in-law, why is he stammering?

1359
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:51,844
You're the one who stammers.

1360
01:24:52,187 --> 01:24:55,156
l'm his master. He's the hired help..

1361
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:59,857
He respects me, so when l stammer he
also stammers as a sign of respect.

1362
01:25:00,228 --> 01:25:03,527
Yes.. - But you've
stammered only once until now.

1363
01:25:07,669 --> 01:25:14,507
Hey.. what've.. you.. c-c-c..

Pudding..
Would you like to have some?

Would you like to eat it?
- No.

1367
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:32,626
N-n-n-n-no.
- Fine.

Hey, Nanny, give me my grandson.

1374
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:47,000
What kind of a nanny is she?

1375
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:49,702
Nanny, give him this grandson.

1376
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:51,073
Give it to me.

My grandson.. he's black.

1378
01:25:56,718 --> 01:25:58,208
How can you say that, Papa?

1379
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:00,119
You can't discriminate
between dark and fair.

1380
01:26:00,255 --> 01:26:02,052
l am wheatish. Mother was wheatish.

1381
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:04,148
Wheatish is fine.

01:26:04,259 --> 01:26:07,228
But he is black and l mean BLACK!

1383
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:11,230
Do something and
handle the situation.

Son-in-law.
- Yes.

1385
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:14,600
How did this happen?

1386
01:26:14,903 --> 01:26:17,804
Because..
my grandma is from Africa.

1387
01:26:17,906 --> 01:26:19,874
African?
- Yes.

1388
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:33,347
Fine, fine, fine.

1389
01:26:34,055 --> 01:26:35,181
What is the name of the child?

01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:36,655
Rahul.
- Rajesh. - Rohan. - Raj.

1391
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:43,728
My Rahul Rajesh Rohan Raj.

1392
01:26:45,366 --> 01:26:48,767
''So what if we black, we

How long will you keep
playing with the child?

Come, l'll show you

Come.
- Come on. Give me the baby. - Here.

My dear baby.

1399
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:12,724
Nanny.

1400
01:27:13,261 --> 01:27:17,095
Nanny. Do l look like a nanny?

1401
01:27:17,332 --> 01:27:21,132
Cook, l.. a.. cook.

1402
01:27:21,736 --> 01:27:22,930
Look, l'm sorry, baby.

1403
01:27:23,037 --> 01:27:25,335
What else could we've done?
- l'll tell you.

1404
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:28,932
We could've told the truth.

1405
01:27:29,043 --> 01:27:30,237
l've already lied umpteen times.

1406
01:27:30,345 --> 01:27:32,108
And l'll have to lie again.

1407
01:27:32,213 --> 01:27:35,376
l was doing the African dance
like a fool in front of her papa.

1408
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:38,211
l don't know what to do.

1409
01:27:38,686 --> 01:27:41,348
l've gone crazy. But it's
no use telling all of you.

1410
01:27:41,723 --> 01:27:43,020
l'm so unfortunate.

1411
01:27:43,424 --> 01:27:45,289
See. See my bad luck.

1412
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:48,227
You're so unfortunate.

1413
01:27:48,463 --> 01:27:49,896
You're so unfortunate.

1414
01:27:49,998 --> 01:27:51,056
You? You?

1415
01:27:51,332 --> 01:27:52,822
My wife is your wife.

1416
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:54,730
Your wife.. is your
wife and my sister.

1417
01:27:54,836 --> 01:27:56,997
Your future wife, is still
your wife, but my sister.

1418
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:59,869
Each time every woman ends
up as your wife and my sister.

1419
01:27:59,974 --> 01:28:01,271
And you're the unfortunate one?

1420
01:28:01,476 --> 01:28:02,773
Wow.

1421
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:07,738
Forget all this. African child?
- lt's Stella's.

1422
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:09,880
You want everything quickly.

1423
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:13,112
Fake child. Fake husband.
Fake house.

1424
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:17,749
Fake.. Papa.

1425
01:28:17,892 --> 01:28:19,291
Don't say that about papa.

1426
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:20,988
He's real.

1427
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:24,056
Papa.

1428
01:28:26,734 --> 01:28:27,894
Papa.

1429
01:28:29,070 --> 01:28:32,267
Papa, we..

1430
01:28:32,373 --> 01:28:37,208
Aunt, don't dance
before these rascals.

1431
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:38,836
Rascals?
- Aunt?

1432
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:41,411
Give me those hands, Dhanno.

1433
01:28:43,951 --> 01:28:45,919
l completely forgot.
- What?

1434
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:48,284
Papa suffers from sleepwalking.

1435
01:28:48,389 --> 01:28:49,788
What?
- We are safe.

1436
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:50,949
Thank God.
- Really? - Yes.

1437
01:28:51,059 --> 01:28:52,356
He doesn't know where he is?
- Yes.

1438
01:28:54,028 --> 01:29:00,092
Gabbar Singh,
shall l consider it a yes? - Yes.

1439
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:03,261
lt's a yes.
- Slowly.

1440
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:09,407
Surma Bhopali.
What's special for Holi?

1441
01:29:10,411 --> 01:29:12,743
That was a close shave.
- Close what..

1442
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:15,945
That was a close shave.
- Sorry.

1443

Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1444

EROS

Good morning.

Nanny! How dare
you kiss your boss..

1492
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:08,173
That's not funny.

Okay.. l am justjoking.

1494
01:33:11,285 --> 01:33:15,221
Son-in-law. Where is my son-in-law?

Are you saying something?

1496
01:33:16,490 --> 01:33:19,050
Son-in-law. Where is my son-in-law?

1497
01:33:22,463 --> 01:33:24,363
Don't know where my son-in-law went.

1498
01:33:24,565 --> 01:33:26,362
Where is papa going so
early in the morning?

1499
01:33:26,467 --> 01:33:27,695
To see his son-in-law.

1500
01:33:27,802 --> 01:33:29,099
And his son-in-law is here.

1501
01:33:29,303 --> 01:33:30,770
Bob is sleeping with Hetal upstairs.

1502

Come on, help me climb up.

1503
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,271

Son-in-law.

Son-in-law, wake up.

1506
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:55,285
Son-in-law.. forget it.

1507
01:33:57,398 --> 01:34:01,027
You idiot, get up! Papa is coming.
- What?

1508
01:34:02,670 --> 01:34:04,399
Son-in-law.

1509
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:06,331
Here..

1510
01:34:06,741 --> 01:34:08,208
Son-in-law, what are you doing?

No, you can't do it.

No, you can't.

01:34:18,185 --> 01:34:24,522
One, two, three..

Four.. five..

01:34:33,467 --> 01:34:39,099
six, seven, eight..

1518
01:34:40,608 --> 01:34:43,338
Nine.

1519
01:34:45,413 --> 01:34:48,541
Ten.

1520
01:34:52,253 --> 01:34:54,687
Get up. Get up.

1521
01:34:54,789 --> 01:34:56,279
Go. Go..

1522
01:34:56,557 --> 01:34:57,683
Hey, cooker.

1523
01:34:58,793 --> 01:35:02,661
What are you doing here?

Order for breakfast.

1527
01:35:09,837 --> 01:35:11,099
Son-in-law, move aside.

1528
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:12,263
What would you like to
have for breakfast..

1529
01:35:23,584 --> 01:35:25,745
Would you like to
have anything else, sir?

1530
01:35:32,493 --> 01:35:34,358
Rahul Rajesh Rohan Raj is crying.

1531
01:35:37,498 --> 01:35:38,658
Not this time.

1532
01:35:38,933 --> 01:35:41,094
Stella, l'm really sorry.
Just listen to me.

1533
01:35:41,368 --> 01:35:43,063
l have a left-right
coordination problem.

1534
01:35:43,170 --> 01:35:44,228
That's why l slapped you.

1535
01:35:44,338 --> 01:35:45,498
That's okay, Son-in-law.

1536
01:35:46,006 --> 01:35:47,098
Stella.

1537
01:35:47,842 --> 01:35:48,866
We are done for.

1538
01:35:49,543 --> 01:35:52,103
How could you?

1539
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:54,142
You said you'll take
my baby for a drive

1540
01:35:54,248 --> 01:35:55,476
..and you kept him this long.

1541
01:35:55,783 --> 01:35:57,341
Who is this?

1542
01:35:57,985 --> 01:36:02,217
She's.. Rahul Rajesh
Rohan Raj's.. teacher.

1543
01:36:02,323 --> 01:36:03,381
She teaches in the school.

1544
01:36:03,491 --> 01:36:06,085
You're lucky l'm taking
him to the play school.

1545
01:36:06,193 --> 01:36:08,024
Otherwise, l
would've called the police.

1546
01:36:08,129 --> 01:36:09,494
Bloody kidnapping!

1547
01:36:10,064 --> 01:36:12,430
Overnight? Kidnapping? Police?

1548
01:36:12,533 --> 01:36:14,057
What was she screaming about?

1549
01:36:14,168 --> 01:36:15,226
Son-in-law!

1550
01:36:16,003 --> 01:36:17,436
Over night.. what does it mean?

1551
01:36:17,538 --> 01:36:20,803
Over night means
that the night is over.

1552
01:36:21,342 --> 01:36:25,779
Kidnapping means
the kid is napping.

1553
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:29,541
And about the school and
the police she meant that..

1554
01:36:29,850 --> 01:36:32,546
..the child will finish school
and become a police officer.

1555
01:36:32,853 --> 01:36:34,878
That's what the teacher
meant to say.

1556
01:36:35,256 --> 01:36:37,121
That's what she was saying.

1557
01:36:38,893 --> 01:36:40,121
Oh that.

1558
01:36:41,428 --> 01:36:42,520
What kind of a woman is she?

1559
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:44,559
She didn't let me
embrace my grandson.

1560
01:36:44,865 --> 01:36:46,560
Yes, that's wrong.

1561
01:36:46,934 --> 01:36:48,196
We should ask the teacher.

1562
01:36:48,435 --> 01:36:50,266
The child is gone.

1563
01:36:50,437 --> 01:36:52,234
The teacher left too.

1564
01:36:52,339 --> 01:36:57,367
And now you.. you..
when will you go?

1565
01:36:58,345 --> 01:37:00,040
How can l leave like that?

1566
01:37:00,314 --> 01:37:03,249
l met my grandson, my daughter,
my son-in-law.

1567
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:04,942
This is my first visit to London.

1568
01:37:05,052 --> 01:37:07,816
Won't you give me a tour of
the city? - Of course we will.

1569
01:37:07,922 --> 01:37:09,253
Hey, cooker, don't touch me.

1570
01:37:18,532 --> 01:37:22,229
l have a problem with my
right-left coordination too

1571
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:27,571
Before the slap session starts
again. Let's get out of here..

1572
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:29,502
l'll show you around London,
come on.

1573
01:37:30,311 --> 01:37:33,872
Son-in-law, this
topless bus is very nice.

1574
01:37:35,649 --> 01:37:37,412
London's double decker.

1575
01:37:40,988 --> 01:37:42,216
See this.

1576
01:37:44,658 --> 01:37:45,989
Hello, Brother.

1577
01:37:47,027 --> 01:37:48,085

1578
01:37:48,429 --> 01:37:50,488
l mean, yippee.

1579
01:37:51,065 --> 01:37:53,260
But how did you come
here all of a sudden?

1580
01:37:54,635 --> 01:37:56,626
Yes, of course, your function..

1581
01:37:56,937 --> 01:37:59,337
..at the Buckingham
Palace cannot be postponed.

1582
01:38:00,407 --> 01:38:01,465
Okay.. .

1583
01:38:01,575 --> 01:38:02,906
We'll meet at home.

1584
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:05,102
Welcome to London, Brother.

1585
01:38:06,247 --> 01:38:07,339
When is papa going back?

1586
01:38:07,448 --> 01:38:09,040
How would l know? Why?

1587
01:38:09,416 --> 01:38:10,974
Because Sandy's brother has arrived.

1588
01:38:11,085 --> 01:38:12,143
What?

1589
01:38:12,653 --> 01:38:14,985
lf your brother comes home..

1590
01:38:15,089 --> 01:38:16,613
..papa will find out everything.

1591
01:38:16,924 --> 01:38:18,448
What will l find out?
Make some room for me.

1592
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:19,617
Papa.

1593
01:38:19,927 --> 01:38:22,225
What will l find out?
What are you whispering?

1594
01:38:22,329 --> 01:38:25,127
Papa, Sandy..
- This nanny..

1595
01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:27,257
No, no, Sandy isn't a nanny.

1596
01:38:27,368 --> 01:38:28,562
No.
- Sandy isn't a nanny.

1597
01:38:28,669 --> 01:38:31,638
No.. Papa, she's
from a wealthy family.

1598
01:38:31,939 --> 01:38:34,533
And..
- And, Papa, her brother..

1599
01:38:34,642 --> 01:38:37,406
..has fixed her marriage
into a wealthier family.

1600
01:38:37,511 --> 01:38:38,569
So?
- So?

1601
01:38:38,679 --> 01:38:40,613
So.. she doesn't want to
get married? - Why?

1602
01:38:40,714 --> 01:38:44,946
Because.. l want to study
further and become a doctor.

1603
01:38:45,052 --> 01:38:47,919
And.. and.. she has
lied to her brother that..

1604
01:38:48,022 --> 01:38:50,217
..she's going to marry
a wealthy boy. - So?

1605
01:38:50,324 --> 01:38:52,451
So, her brother has arrived, Papa.

1606
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:56,687
To meet her fianc
- What now?

1607
01:38:56,997 --> 01:38:58,521
What now?
- What now?

1608
01:38:58,632 --> 01:39:03,035
We should help.. this.. poor girl.

1609
01:39:03,137 --> 01:39:04,604
Yes, we should help her,
we should help her.

1610
01:39:04,705 --> 01:39:07,071
But how will we help her?
- How?

1611
01:39:07,174 --> 01:39:09,438
We can pretend to be
the boy's family. - Yes.

1612
01:39:09,543 --> 01:39:10,669
Very good idea.
- Good idea.

1613
01:39:10,978 --> 01:39:13,538
And.. and who will be her fiance?
Who will it be?

1614
01:39:13,647 --> 01:39:16,946
l'll be her fiance.
- No, Son-in-law, how can you?

1615
01:39:17,184 --> 01:39:19,550
Papa, it's just a charade.
lt's not real.

1616
01:39:19,653 --> 01:39:21,314
And Zulekha can be your wife.

1617
01:39:21,422 --> 01:39:22,480
Yes.

1618
01:39:22,589 --> 01:39:24,386
Good idea.
- Good deal.

1619
01:39:25,059 --> 01:39:26,151
Good idea.

1620
01:39:27,461 --> 01:39:29,224
But who is her brother?

1621
01:39:50,684 --> 01:39:53,414
Stay away from my sister

1622
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:01,118
Brother!

1623
01:40:05,366 --> 01:40:06,628
How are you?

1624
01:40:07,301 --> 01:40:08,598
l am fine.

1625
01:40:10,738 --> 01:40:12,000
Where have your
dimples disappeared?

1626
01:40:12,106 --> 01:40:13,505
You didn't come to see
me in the last six months.

1627
01:40:13,807 --> 01:40:15,297
Wonder where they disappeared?

1628
01:40:16,143 --> 01:40:18,509
Let's see where they are.

1629
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:20,473
Where could they be?

1630
01:40:23,083 --> 01:40:24,277
There they are

1631
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:29,018
Brother, let me introduce
you to Aarush's family.

1632
01:40:30,224 --> 01:40:31,714
He..
- l'm Aarush's papa.

1633
01:40:32,326 --> 01:40:34,021
And l'm his mother.

1634
01:40:34,294 --> 01:40:35,591
l'm Aarush's sister.

1635
01:40:35,829 --> 01:40:37,490
And l'm Aarush's sister's husband.

1636
01:40:52,146 --> 01:40:53,340
Aarush, are you okay?

1637
01:40:54,782 --> 01:40:56,079
He's fine.
- Get up.

1638
01:40:56,183 --> 01:40:57,673
Get up. Get up. Come. Get up.

1639
01:41:09,763 --> 01:41:12,789
You okay?
- Thank you.

1640
01:41:17,538 --> 01:41:19,267
You saw me and you fainted. Why?

1641
01:41:22,509 --> 01:41:24,272
lt was quite hot outside.

1642
01:41:25,212 --> 01:41:26,702
So l got a sun-stroke.

1643
01:41:28,549 --> 01:41:29,675
Sprinkle some water.

1644
01:41:31,452 --> 01:41:32,714
Sprinkle some water.

1645
01:41:41,595 --> 01:41:42,721
l've seen you somewhere.

1646
01:41:45,232 --> 01:41:46,324
Where have l seen you?

1647
01:41:47,267 --> 01:41:49,735
You look familiar as well.

1648
01:41:50,637 --> 01:41:53,504
But l haven't seen you anywhere.

1649
01:41:57,878 --> 01:41:59,209
What do you do?

1650
01:41:59,313 --> 01:42:03,306
Brother. Stop this interrogation.

1651
01:42:03,517 --> 01:42:05,109
l thought your trip was cancelled.

1652
01:42:05,219 --> 01:42:06,447
How did you make it here?

1653
01:42:07,254 --> 01:42:08,687
l knew you'd forget!

1654
01:42:11,258 --> 01:42:13,692
Because today is 'Raksha Bandhan'.

1655
01:42:14,595 --> 01:42:16,620
Oh, God. l forgot.

1656
01:42:16,897 --> 01:42:18,387
That's why l've brought
a Sacred thread along.

1657
01:42:19,933 --> 01:42:21,366
Why do you have two?

1658
01:42:21,768 --> 01:42:23,895
Puja sent it for me.
- ls she coming?

1659
01:42:25,506 --> 01:42:27,474
No, she's in Vegas
with her husband.

1660
01:42:27,574 --> 01:42:28,802
You can tie it for me.

1661
01:42:31,378 --> 01:42:32,743
You're not wearing
a 'sacred thread'?

1662
01:42:32,946 --> 01:42:34,345
Why not?

1663
01:42:35,382 --> 01:42:36,474
Because..

1664
01:42:37,885 --> 01:42:40,410
l forgot, just like Sandy,
that today is 'Raksha Bandhan'.

1665
01:42:41,188 --> 01:42:42,348
That's okay

1666
01:42:42,723 --> 01:42:43,781
l've brought two threads.

1667
01:42:43,891 --> 01:42:45,791
Hetal, tie one to Aarush.
- Okay.

1668
01:42:45,893 --> 01:42:47,622
No, no, no.

1669
01:42:48,695 --> 01:42:49,787
This isn't possible.

1670
01:42:49,897 --> 01:42:51,694
lf Hetal ties the 'thread'..

1671
01:42:51,798 --> 01:42:53,561
..This is sacrilege.

1672
01:42:55,335 --> 01:42:57,803
Why? - Because 'Raksha
Bandhan' was yesterday.

1673
01:42:58,772 --> 01:43:01,866
No, Uncle. 'Raksha Bandhan'
is today.

1674
01:43:02,309 --> 01:43:03,640
Come, Hetal..

1675
01:43:08,815 --> 01:43:12,342
Are you sure..
l haven't seen you before?

1676
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:14,410
There's some connection.

1677
01:43:14,755 --> 01:43:16,552
Puja.
- Puja (veneration platter)?

1678
01:43:16,723 --> 01:43:18,520
The veneration platter
hasn't arrived.

1679
01:43:19,359 --> 01:43:21,259
You didn't bring the
veneration platter.

1680
01:43:21,562 --> 01:43:24,292
When you've forgotten the Rakhi..
There's no need for that.

1681
01:43:24,831 --> 01:43:26,196
Tie it like that.

1682
01:43:28,769 --> 01:43:35,436
''Even the stars and flowers know.''

1683
01:43:36,443 --> 01:43:41,380
''That my sister is
one in a million.''

1684
01:43:41,848 --> 01:43:47,980
''And we'll always stay
together like this.''

1685
01:43:48,455 --> 01:43:50,286
This is terrible.

1686
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:01,895
What are you doing?
- Krishna is Puja's brother.

1687
01:44:02,002 --> 01:44:03,299
So?

1688
01:44:04,538 --> 01:44:07,268
Puja? The one in Macao.
- Yes.

1689
01:44:07,374 --> 01:44:08,602
But Krishna is Sandy's brother.

1690
01:44:08,709 --> 01:44:10,836
They both are his sisters.
- Both.

1691
01:44:10,944 --> 01:44:14,380
l'm so unfortunate..
lf you were my girlfriend..

1692
01:44:14,481 --> 01:44:16,005
..he would've been
your brother as well.

1693
01:44:16,483 --> 01:44:17,780
l'm very stressed.

1694
01:44:17,884 --> 01:44:20,011
l don't know what to do.

1695
01:44:20,787 --> 01:44:22,914
One minute..
- l'll tell everyone the truth.

1696
01:44:23,023 --> 01:44:25,287
No.
- l'll tell Sandy the truth.

1697
01:44:25,392 --> 01:44:27,019
You won't tell Sandy anything.

1698
01:44:27,327 --> 01:44:28,385
She won't understand.
- No, l will.

1699
01:44:28,495 --> 01:44:30,588
You'll have to tell her
after you two get married.

1700
01:44:30,697 --> 01:44:33,461
l can't.. - You know one thing.
You will have to lie.

1701
01:44:33,567 --> 01:44:34,795
l can't lie.

1702
01:44:34,901 --> 01:44:38,428
A lie isn't a lie if its
said for a noble cause..

1703
01:44:39,373 --> 01:44:40,431
lt isn't.

1704
01:44:40,774 --> 01:44:44,505
l can't lie.
- You will have to.

1705
01:44:45,579 --> 01:44:47,410
For Sandy's sake.

1706
01:44:48,815 --> 01:44:53,047
For Sandy.. Fine.

1707
01:44:53,987 --> 01:44:56,012
l'll lie for the last time.

1708
01:44:56,590 --> 01:44:58,285
Last time.

1709
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:01,721
lt's the last time.

1710
01:45:01,828 --> 01:45:04,388
lt's very strenuous.

1711
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,297
This isn't the last time.

1712
01:45:08,568 --> 01:45:10,297
you'll have to do it
over and over again..

1713
01:45:21,882 --> 01:45:24,680
Brother, why are you
growing your hair?

1714
01:45:25,018 --> 01:45:26,349
Competing with me?

1715
01:45:26,453 --> 01:45:27,647
Hey, dear.

1716
01:45:28,689 --> 01:45:30,850
l was on field posting in
Afghanistan, that's why.

1717
01:45:31,692 --> 01:45:33,023
You're looking so handsome.

1718
01:45:33,126 --> 01:45:34,991
Brother. Brother.

1719
01:45:35,495 --> 01:45:38,589
l've got strawberries,
peaches, orange for you..

1720
01:45:38,699 --> 01:45:41,532
..grapes, biscuits.. brother.
- Brother?

1721
01:45:42,536 --> 01:45:43,594
Sir.

1722
01:45:43,904 --> 01:45:45,531
Suck your paunch in..

1723
01:45:46,973 --> 01:45:48,998
Brother, the two of you'll are
looking very nice together..

1724
01:45:49,409 --> 01:45:50,671
Nice happy family.

1725
01:45:51,011 --> 01:45:53,445
You haven't met
my entire family yet.

1726
01:45:53,814 --> 01:45:55,975
l wish sister could
meet Aarush as well.

1727
01:45:57,651 --> 01:45:59,642
She can.
- How?

1728
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:01,612
Stand together.

1729
01:46:01,888 --> 01:46:03,913
l'll take your photo
and send an MMS.

1730
01:46:06,693 --> 01:46:07,819
What now?

1731
01:46:07,994 --> 01:46:09,359
lt isn't too hot.

1732
01:46:09,563 --> 01:46:11,053
You can't get a sun-stroke.

1733
01:46:11,932 --> 01:46:13,866
l'm camera conscious.

1734
01:46:14,735 --> 01:46:16,828
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

1735
01:46:20,474 --> 01:46:21,600
Why are you making faces?

1736
01:46:21,708 --> 01:46:24,506
Something went into my eye.

1737
01:46:24,611 --> 01:46:25,669
Come on.
- Come on.

1738
01:46:25,779 --> 01:46:27,508
Come on, smile.
- Smile.

1739
01:46:27,881 --> 01:46:29,712
No more camera conscious.

1740
01:46:30,584 --> 01:46:32,017
Strand straight.
- Ok.

1741
01:46:35,956 --> 01:46:37,116
Perfect.

1742
01:46:37,758 --> 01:46:39,157
l'll send it to Puja right away.

1743
01:46:40,961 --> 01:46:42,155
He isn't even photogenic.

1744
01:46:49,569 --> 01:46:50,900
That's fine..

1745
01:46:52,773 --> 01:46:56,539
Hello.
- Hello, darling, how are you?

1746
01:46:56,977 --> 01:46:59,411
Who is this? - ''Who is this?''
Have you forgotten..

1747
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:04,412
..that steamy night we had together?
- What?

1748
01:47:09,022 --> 01:47:12,423
Hello. - Remember, you
took me to Hotel Nagraj..

1749
01:47:12,526 --> 01:47:14,619
..where we saw the
movie 'Dostana' twice.

1750
01:47:14,728 --> 01:47:17,925
you've got the wrong number,
don't call again.

1751
01:47:25,105 --> 01:47:28,666
Sacrilege! Sacrilege!

1752
01:47:29,042 --> 01:47:31,203
Brother, stop all this.

1753
01:47:31,678 --> 01:47:33,111
l mean, you must be tired.

1754
01:47:33,213 --> 01:47:36,011
Go and freshen up.
Send a MMS later. Okay?

1755
01:47:38,952 --> 01:47:40,852
Come on, show me my room.
- Come.

1756
01:49:29,729 --> 01:49:30,923
The job's done.

1757
01:49:31,097 --> 01:49:33,122
That was fun.
- l'm satisfied.

1758
01:49:33,233 --> 01:49:34,723
lt was sweaty.
- Even l was.

1759
01:49:34,834 --> 01:49:35,994
Come on.

1760
01:49:41,808 --> 01:49:45,744
Krishna.
- What are you doing here?

1761
01:49:46,346 --> 01:49:48,109
l came here to give
you holy offerings.

1762
01:49:48,815 --> 01:49:54,185
Oh.
- But, you too? - What?

1763
01:49:56,022 --> 01:50:00,584
You bathe with a boy?
- Yes.

1764
01:50:03,129 --> 01:50:05,359
lt's terrible.

1765
01:50:06,766 --> 01:50:09,166
What's so shocking about
bathing with lifebuoy soap?

1766
01:50:10,804 --> 01:50:12,101
lt's a weird family.

1767
01:50:36,196 --> 01:50:37,788
My phone..

1768
01:50:41,868 --> 01:50:43,130
Something wrong?

1769
01:50:44,304 --> 01:50:48,400
He forgets that
he's allergic to bread.

1770
01:50:50,010 --> 01:50:52,308
Oh, l thought hearing
about my phone..

1771
01:50:52,412 --> 01:50:54,403
What happened to your phone?
What happened?

1772
01:50:55,148 --> 01:50:58,709
When l was bathing in the tub
it was kept outside. - Okay.

1773
01:50:58,952 --> 01:51:03,389
When l came out, it was
inside the tub. - Okay.

1774
01:51:05,091 --> 01:51:07,082
When you were inside the
tub the phone was outside.

1775
01:51:07,193 --> 01:51:09,320
When you came out of the
tub the phone was inside.

1776
01:51:09,429 --> 01:51:12,660
You're having phone tub-ble!
How funny.

1777
01:51:23,777 --> 01:51:28,077
''Oh boy, you are mine.''

1778
01:51:30,183 --> 01:51:34,449
''Oh boy, you are mine.''

1779
01:51:34,754 --> 01:51:40,351
''Oh boy, you are mine.''

1780
01:51:41,027 --> 01:51:45,157
''Oh girl, you are mine.''

1781
01:51:45,265 --> 01:51:47,756
''Oh girl, you are mine.''

1782
01:51:57,777 --> 01:52:00,177
What?
- That's my leg.

1783
01:52:10,356 --> 01:52:12,085
What are you doing, Aarush?

1784
01:52:12,192 --> 01:52:14,319
l don't think your
brother likes me.

1785
01:52:14,861 --> 01:52:16,920
Don't be silly, baby,
its nothing like that..

1786
01:52:17,030 --> 01:52:18,327
l mean it.

1787
01:52:18,932 --> 01:52:20,297
Aarush..
- He keeps staring at me.

1788
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,458
You're just imagining things.

1789
01:52:21,768 --> 01:52:22,826
it's nothing like that, okay

1790
01:52:22,936 --> 01:52:25,404
l'm telling you.

1791
01:52:25,839 --> 01:52:27,363
You have a sore throat.
- No.

1792
01:52:27,474 --> 01:52:29,465
Sister.
- Brother.

1793
01:52:30,910 --> 01:52:32,070
Sorry, sir.

1794
01:52:32,979 --> 01:52:35,470
What's going on here?
- Nothing.

1795
01:52:38,384 --> 01:52:40,079
Go and sleep in your room.

1796
01:52:40,386 --> 01:52:41,944
l need to talk to Aarush, alone.

1797
01:52:45,859 --> 01:52:46,951
Goodnight.

1798
01:52:50,163 --> 01:52:51,460
Aarush.
- Yes.

1799
01:52:55,468 --> 01:53:00,201
My baggage got exchanged with
someone else's at the airport.

1800
01:53:00,306 --> 01:53:01,864
Sorry to hear that, sir.

1801
01:53:02,575 --> 01:53:04,338
Do you have a pyjama?
- Yes.

1802
01:53:04,444 --> 01:53:05,775
l'll get it right away.

1803
01:53:09,883 --> 01:53:11,510
Here, you can wear it.

1804
01:53:11,818 --> 01:53:13,217
l was going to wear it tonight.

1805
01:53:13,319 --> 01:53:14,911
But l will sleep in my shorts.

1806
01:53:16,022 --> 01:53:19,219
You wear these disgusting,
threaded pyjamas.

1807
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:22,060
The thread provides a good grip.

1808
01:53:22,262 --> 01:53:24,162
The pyjama doesn't come
off while sleeping at night.

1809
01:53:24,264 --> 01:53:25,526
That's why l wear it, sir.

1810
01:53:25,932 --> 01:53:29,561
Go to Sleep.
- So early?

1811
01:53:30,303 --> 01:53:32,294
Go to Sleep.
- Fine, sir.

1812
01:53:32,539 --> 01:53:33,801
Goodnight, sir.

1813
01:53:38,178 --> 01:53:41,272
Hey, cooker,
what are you doing here?

1814
01:53:43,316 --> 01:53:45,807
She's my wife.
- That's just a charade.

1815
01:53:46,219 --> 01:53:47,311
We were just pretending.

1816
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:50,116
Hetal, go and
sleep in Sandy's room.

1817
01:53:50,223 --> 01:53:51,281
Come on.

1818
01:53:52,225 --> 01:53:53,283
Go on.

1819
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:56,451
Bye.
- Goodnight.

1820
01:53:57,230 --> 01:53:58,288
Where are you going?

1821
01:53:58,398 --> 01:54:01,265
l was.. - Tonight you'll
sleep with me in this room.

1822
01:54:01,367 --> 01:54:03,528
l'll keep a watch on you.

1823
01:54:04,103 --> 01:54:05,195
Okay, Papa.

1824
01:54:11,311 --> 01:54:13,279
How are you? Everything fine?

1825
01:54:13,913 --> 01:54:16,848
Hey papa come quickly to bed,
l'm already undressed.

1826
01:54:21,421 --> 01:54:24,390
Papa l love kissing you..

1827
01:54:32,966 --> 01:54:34,058
What are you staring at?

1828
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:35,392
You'll sleep on the floor.

1829
01:54:46,079 --> 01:54:47,239
What are you doing?

1830
01:54:48,147 --> 01:54:50,513
l'm making a bunker.

1831
01:54:51,150 --> 01:54:54,586
Because fidget in my sleep?
You might get hurt.

1832
01:54:56,122 --> 01:54:59,148
How do you know that you fidget
in your sleep, if you're sleeping?

1833
01:54:59,592 --> 01:55:00,991
Sandy told me.

1834
01:55:05,031 --> 01:55:08,364
You haven't done any hanky-panky
with my sister, have you?

1835
01:55:09,002 --> 01:55:11,334
Major, l haven't done
any hanky or panky..

1836
01:55:11,437 --> 01:55:13,496
..with anyone's sister.

1837
01:55:14,140 --> 01:55:15,471
l'm still a pure..

1838
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:19,270
l don't want to know.

1839
01:55:20,179 --> 01:55:21,942
Sleep.
- Yes.

1840
01:55:23,049 --> 01:55:24,482
Goodnight.
- Sleep.

1841
01:55:37,730 --> 01:55:40,528
Sir.. where are you taking
me early in the morning?

1842
01:55:41,501 --> 01:55:43,332
My suitcase got exchanged..

1843
01:55:43,503 --> 01:55:46,097
..with someone called
Kishore Samtani.

1844
01:55:46,673 --> 01:55:47,970
l'm on my way to get it back.

1845
01:55:48,074 --> 01:55:51,237
Kishore Samtani? That means,
Bob's casino? l am done for.

1846
01:55:57,350 --> 01:55:58,715
Thank you.
- Welcome.

1847
01:56:04,057 --> 01:56:08,153
Where are you going?
- l'm going to make a call.

1848
01:56:09,996 --> 01:56:11,088
Only one.

1849
01:56:16,436 --> 01:56:18,734
Son-in-law. When did you arrive?

1850
01:56:19,038 --> 01:56:20,096
What are you doing here?

1851
01:56:20,206 --> 01:56:22,367
Where is my daughter?
- She's at home.

1852
01:56:22,542 --> 01:56:24,169
Ooh home. Fine, let's go inside.

1853
01:56:24,277 --> 01:56:28,338
l'll.. just go to the bathroom.
- Bathroom? - Yes.

1854
01:56:28,448 --> 01:56:29,972
There's a bathroom inside as well.

1855
01:56:30,383 --> 01:56:31,714
This isn't an inn.

1856
01:56:32,318 --> 01:56:35,651
This is your hotel, your casino.
And so is the toilet.

1857
01:56:35,755 --> 01:56:37,017
Come on. Take this and come on.

1858
01:56:37,123 --> 01:56:38,590
Sir.. sir.

1859
01:56:41,361 --> 01:56:43,352

Yes, l'll wait for you here.
- Yes.

1862
01:56:48,534 --> 01:56:50,434
Boy, get me a drink.

1863
01:57:00,079 --> 01:57:01,205
Are you okay now?

1864
01:57:03,182 --> 01:57:04,444
Now that you've come here..

1865
01:57:04,550 --> 01:57:06,279
..come with me, to return the bag.

1866
01:57:06,519 --> 01:57:10,421

1867
01:57:10,723 --> 01:57:13,214
Why? - l need to go

1868
01:57:16,195 --> 01:57:18,220
l'll wait for you.
- Okay.

1869

1870
01:57:39,385 --> 01:57:40,545
Mr. Kishor Samtani.

1871
01:57:42,188 --> 01:57:44,349
Major Krishna.
- Oh, yes.

1872
01:57:44,757 --> 01:57:47,487
l saw your bag.. my bag, so..

1873
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:49,352
Sorry about that confusion.

1874
01:57:49,595 --> 01:57:51,529
So nice of you.
- Thank you.

1875
01:57:59,439 --> 01:58:01,066
Are you waiting for someone?

1876
01:58:02,175 --> 01:58:03,403
l'm waiting for my son-in-law.

1877
01:58:03,509 --> 01:58:04,669
He's in the bathroom.

1878
01:58:05,778 --> 01:58:08,611
And you? - Yes, l'm
waiting for someone as well.

01:58:09,182 --> 01:58:10,774
ls he in the bathroom as well?

1880
01:58:11,517 --> 01:58:12,848
What a coincidence?

Excuse me.
- Sure.

1882
01:58:18,191 --> 01:58:19,249
Hello.

1883
01:58:19,425 --> 01:58:23,327
Son-in-law.
- l'm in your office.

1884
01:58:24,430 --> 01:58:25,488
ln the office?

1885
01:58:25,598 --> 01:58:27,088
l didn't want to disturb you..

1886
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:29,430
..when you were exchanging the bag.

1887
01:58:29,535 --> 01:58:30,797
So, l came directly to your office.

1888
01:58:30,903 --> 01:58:33,337
Okay, l'll be right there.

1889
01:58:34,807 --> 01:58:36,172
See you.
- Yes.

1890
01:58:36,275 --> 01:58:38,106
My son-in-law is already in office.

1891
01:58:47,687 --> 01:58:49,552
Let's go, exchange the bag.

1892
01:58:50,289 --> 01:58:52,189
Mission successful, we've
already exchanged the bag.

1893
01:58:52,291 --> 01:58:54,122
Oh, l missed it.
- Come on, let's go home.

1894
01:58:54,227 --> 01:58:58,220
Yes. l'll get it. Let's go.

1895
01:59:05,338 --> 01:59:06,703
l know..

1896
01:59:07,373 --> 01:59:09,500
Shall we?
- Where does your sister work?

1897
01:59:12,178 --> 01:59:13,611
Hide.
- What?

1898
01:59:14,447 --> 01:59:19,214
No.. She teaches aerobics
at Hyde Park. To children.

1899
01:59:20,653 --> 01:59:22,746
She teaches aerobics at Hyde Park?
- Yes.

1900
01:59:24,724 --> 01:59:26,191
Let's go to the casino.

1901
01:59:45,578 --> 01:59:46,704
Move.

1902
01:59:51,551 --> 01:59:53,314
No one wins.

1903
01:59:53,853 --> 01:59:54,945
What happened?

1904
01:59:55,421 --> 01:59:57,582
l just saw your
brother-in-law here.

1905
01:59:57,890 --> 02:00:00,586
ls it?
- Come.

1906
02:00:00,826 --> 02:00:01,952
Come with me.

1907
02:00:23,449 --> 02:00:26,213
Sit.
- Sir, but..

1908
02:00:28,688 --> 02:00:30,383
Sit down.
- Okay.

1909
02:00:44,370 --> 02:00:46,235
Maybe l'm wrong about you..

1910
02:00:48,474 --> 02:00:50,999
Fold your sleeves.

1911
02:00:53,579 --> 02:00:56,377
maybe you have nothing to do..

1912
02:00:56,716 --> 02:00:58,581
..with my phone falling
into the tub.

1913
02:00:59,452 --> 02:01:03,388
Maybe the waitress l saw at
the casino wasn't your sister.

1914
02:01:04,457 --> 02:01:07,620
Maybe that dealer
wasn't your brother-in-law.

1915
02:01:09,295 --> 02:01:13,425
Maybe.. the man who was
waiting for his son-in-law..

1916
02:01:14,467 --> 02:01:17,732
..outside the bathroom was
waiting for someone else.

1917
02:01:17,837 --> 02:01:21,568
And there was someone else
other than you in the bathroom.

1918
02:01:22,808 --> 02:01:26,574
lf any of these maybe's are true..

1919
02:01:27,513 --> 02:01:29,708
..then l won't let
my sister marry you.

1920
02:01:31,784 --> 02:01:36,585
And to know the truth l'm
going to use this lie detector.

1921
02:01:38,424 --> 02:01:42,360
You can lie to me
but not to this machine

1922
02:01:42,595 --> 02:01:44,062
Brother, what are you doing?

1923
02:01:46,432 --> 02:01:48,366
Finding out the truth.

1924
02:01:49,602 --> 02:01:51,297
Aarush doesn't have any objections.

1925
02:01:51,737 --> 02:01:52,863
Right, Aarush?

1926
02:01:54,774 --> 02:01:55,832
Great.

1927
02:01:55,941 --> 02:01:57,408
So, it's simple.

1928
02:01:58,010 --> 02:02:00,001
lf you speak the truth..

1929
02:02:00,713 --> 02:02:01,941
..the needle will
point towards green.

1930
02:02:02,782 --> 02:02:06,377
lf you lie, the needle
will point towards red.

1931
02:02:06,485 --> 02:02:09,045
And on red if the
needle even once goes..

1932
02:02:10,890 --> 02:02:12,755
Then out of your life,
my sister goes!

1933
02:02:14,093 --> 02:02:15,685
let's start with
a simple question

1934
02:02:16,696 --> 02:02:19,358
Answer only with 'yes' or 'no'

1935
02:02:19,965 --> 02:02:21,091
Okay.

1936
02:02:23,436 --> 02:02:24,835
ls your name Aarush?

1937
02:02:29,141 --> 02:02:30,403
Yes.

1938
02:02:31,610 --> 02:02:32,941
See, it works.

1939
02:02:35,047 --> 02:02:36,571
ls this your house?

1940
02:02:46,892 --> 02:02:48,655
ls this your house?

1941
02:02:51,564 --> 02:02:52,758
No.

1942
02:03:00,072 --> 02:03:01,437
lt's hers.

1943
02:03:04,410 --> 02:03:08,437
lt's Aarush's house
but it's in her name.

1944
02:03:11,417 --> 02:03:13,681
Have l seen you before
l came into this house?

1945
02:03:23,829 --> 02:03:24,989
No.

1946
02:03:30,836 --> 02:03:32,064
Are you married?

1947
02:03:43,716 --> 02:03:44,842
No.

1948
02:03:49,822 --> 02:03:53,485
Are they..
- Stop it, Brother, please.

1949
02:03:54,059 --> 02:03:56,186
l respect you,
but that doesn't mean..

1950
02:03:56,495 --> 02:03:57,928
..l disrespect Aarush.

1951
02:03:58,931 --> 02:04:00,956
And by doing this
you're insulting Aarush

1952
02:04:01,066 --> 02:04:02,124
l'm your brother!

1953
02:04:02,234 --> 02:04:03,826
l have the right to
ask these question.

1954
02:04:03,936 --> 02:04:04,994
Fine! lf you want
to know the truth..

1955
02:04:05,104 --> 02:04:06,696
..then these should be
the questions.

1956
02:04:08,073 --> 02:04:09,199
Aarush.

1957
02:04:11,677 --> 02:04:17,912
Aarush, do you love me?
- Yes.

1958
02:04:21,587 --> 02:04:24,181
Will you always?
- Yes.

1959
02:04:30,529 --> 02:04:33,589
Will you ever deceive me?
- Never.

1960
02:04:38,170 --> 02:04:40,195
Will you protect me..

1961
02:04:40,673 --> 02:04:44,905
..just like my brother did
for so many years? - Yes.

1962
02:04:56,689 --> 02:04:58,486
What more can a brother ask for?

1963
02:04:59,592 --> 02:05:01,560
Somebody loves his sister so much.

1964
02:05:03,128 --> 02:05:04,686
l apologise to all of you.

1965
02:05:05,831 --> 02:05:07,628
My work and my nature is such that..

1966
02:05:07,733 --> 02:05:09,530
..l'm used to doubting people.

1967
02:05:10,002 --> 02:05:11,128
Aarush.

1968
02:05:13,606 --> 02:05:15,164
l misunderstood you.

1969
02:05:16,075 --> 02:05:17,235
l'm really sorry.

1970
02:05:18,143 --> 02:05:19,610
Welcome to the family.

1971
02:05:23,649 --> 02:05:26,277
Brother.
- Aarush. Congratulations.

1972
02:05:26,819 --> 02:05:27,979
l can understand the rest..

1973
02:05:28,087 --> 02:05:29,645
..but you're married.
- Yes.

1974
02:05:29,755 --> 02:05:31,052
How did you say yes?
- Yes.

1975
02:05:31,323 --> 02:05:33,723
Devika called this evening.
- Yes.

1976
02:05:33,826 --> 02:05:34,884
Outside casino..

1977
02:05:34,994 --> 02:05:36,291
Cover me.
- Yes.

1978
02:05:36,829 --> 02:05:38,956
And she said that the
divorce has been accepted.

1979
02:05:39,231 --> 02:05:40,528
What are you saying?

1980
02:05:40,766 --> 02:05:41,824
Congratulations.

1981
02:05:41,934 --> 02:05:43,663
This calls for a celebration.

1982
02:05:45,838 --> 02:05:47,032
You both come here.

1983
02:05:52,311 --> 02:05:53,710
Boys' night out.

1984
02:06:08,994 --> 02:06:10,120
Wow.

1985
02:06:11,297 --> 02:06:12,787
What beautiful embroidery.

1986
02:06:13,999 --> 02:06:16,968
l'm sure they must've
used 1000 labourers.

1987
02:06:20,005 --> 02:06:22,098
Come. Come with me.

1988
02:06:25,444 --> 02:06:27,002
Welcome to Buckingham palace.

1989
02:06:27,112 --> 02:06:28,739

1990
02:06:29,114 --> 02:06:34,142

And you brought us all here.

1994

l had to, Aarush,
you're family now.

1995
02:06:43,295 --> 02:06:45,126
And anyway, the big day
isn't today. lt's tomorrow..

1996
02:06:45,864 --> 02:06:46,922
Tomorrow?

1997
02:06:47,032 --> 02:06:48,226
We have to come back
here tomorrow again.

1998
02:06:49,234 --> 02:06:53,796
No, Aarush, l've decided to get
you and Sandy engaged tomorrow.

1999
02:06:54,173 --> 02:06:56,368
Major Rao.
- Yes.

02:07:10,089 --> 02:07:11,954
We're being unjust with him.

2005
02:07:12,257 --> 02:07:13,952
What?
- Yes.

2006
02:07:14,159 --> 02:07:16,024
l should tell him everything.

2007
02:07:17,029 --> 02:07:19,327
Have you gone mad?
- No, no, listen to me.

2008
02:07:19,431 --> 02:07:21,023
Come on.

2009
02:07:23,002 --> 02:07:24,060
Hello.

Santa.
- And Banta.

2011
02:07:25,838 --> 02:07:29,330
We're here to cool
the Buckingham Palace.

2012
02:07:29,975 --> 02:07:33,103
Santa Banta coming in for AC
maintenance. - That's done.

2013
02:07:33,278 --> 02:07:34,905
lt's really fun, Banta.

2014
02:07:35,014 --> 02:07:37,744
Buckingham Palace.

Banta, be silent.
- Okay.

Santa.

02:07:50,896 --> 02:07:52,124
Don't touch that.

2020
02:07:52,231 --> 02:07:53,892
That's the wrong cylinder.

2021
02:07:53,999 --> 02:07:56,194
How can l pick it up
without touching it?

2022
02:07:57,369 --> 02:07:58,893
What a joke. What a joke.

2023
02:07:59,004 --> 02:08:02,201
Santa, we're here to put
the coolant, not that one.

2024
02:08:03,342 --> 02:08:04,502
lf we open that here..

2025
02:08:04,810 --> 02:08:06,107
..people will go crazy
with a fit of laughter

2026
02:08:06,211 --> 02:08:09,772
Why is that?
- Because this contains laughing gas.

2027
02:08:09,982 --> 02:08:11,449
lt's called nitrous oxide.

2028
02:08:11,817 --> 02:08:14,115
We have to deliver it
to the dentist, later.

2029
02:08:14,420 --> 02:08:16,911
They use during tooth extractions

2030
02:08:17,022 --> 02:08:20,219
And that's the tooth haha.. Truth..

2031
02:08:20,826 --> 02:08:21,918
What are you doing?

2032
02:08:22,027 --> 02:08:23,255
What are you doing?

2033
02:08:23,362 --> 02:08:25,990
Bob, l want to speak the truth,
and l will. - No, you won't.

2034
02:08:26,098 --> 02:08:29,363
l will.
- Aarush. Listen to me.

2035
02:08:30,369 --> 02:08:31,961
Aarush you can explain
after you get married.

2036
02:08:32,071 --> 02:08:34,232
l'm not going to lie anymore

2037
02:08:34,406 --> 02:08:38,433
Listen to me.
- Enough.

2038

Aarush, l'm telling you.

2039
02:08:52,024 --> 02:08:53,150
l want to tell the truth.

2040
02:08:53,325 --> 02:09:02,233
''When you want to tell the truth and
your ill-luck comes in between you.''

2041
02:09:02,501 --> 02:09:07,029
''How long can he run from bad luck?''

2042
02:09:07,239 --> 02:09:11,335
''Now we have to watch, what's next.''

2043
02:09:11,443 --> 02:09:15,311
''Jinx, such a jinx.

2044
02:09:16,081 --> 02:09:19,573
''Not seen a man like him.''

2045
02:09:19,885 --> 02:09:28,315
''He's such a loser.''

2046
02:09:47,312 --> 02:09:50,145
Her majesty, queen
Elizabeth the 2nd.

2047
02:09:50,315 --> 02:09:51,612
Duke of Lancaster.

2048
02:09:51,917 --> 02:09:53,350
Duke of Normandy.

2049
02:09:53,452 --> 02:09:54,646
Defender of the faith.

2050
02:10:27,719 --> 02:10:29,914
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

2051
02:10:30,656 --> 02:10:35,559
l would like to welcome
the heroes of the moment.

2052
02:10:36,361 --> 02:10:39,159
Those various soldiers
from around the world..

2053
02:10:39,364 --> 02:10:41,332
..who have given their services..

2054
02:10:41,667 --> 02:10:46,263
..and have put their life in
danger to save the world..

2055
02:10:46,371 --> 02:10:50,967
..from the constant and
immediate threats of terrorism.

2056
02:10:51,577 --> 02:10:54,102
l would also like to
thank their families..

2057
02:10:54,313 --> 02:10:57,976
..for their constant
and silent support.

2058
02:10:58,483 --> 02:11:03,546
May l now request her
majesty to honour these heroes.

2059
02:11:11,496 --> 02:11:13,657
Santa, quickly fill the coolant.

2060
02:11:13,765 --> 02:11:15,562
The queen's party
must have started.

2061
02:11:16,368 --> 02:11:19,337
Come on. Tighten it.

2062
02:11:29,081 --> 02:11:31,481
From lndia.. Major Krishna Rao.

2063
02:12:13,125 --> 02:12:15,025
What?
- What happened?

2064
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:16,691
Why are you laughing so much?

2065
02:12:17,663 --> 02:12:19,688
Seems like you thought
of a very funny joke..

2066
02:12:19,798 --> 02:12:21,629
..and you aren't
telling me about it.

2067
02:12:25,404 --> 02:12:27,201
lt must be such a funny joke.

2068
02:12:27,306 --> 02:12:30,571
l'm laughing so
profusely before hearing it.

2069
02:12:31,743 --> 02:12:36,271
You scoundrel, rascal, you fool.

2070
02:12:36,548 --> 02:12:38,641
You put in the wrong cylinder.
- ls it?

2071
02:12:39,284 --> 02:12:40,615
This is the laughing gas.

2072
02:12:43,488 --> 02:12:45,251
Stop it.

2073
02:12:51,129 --> 02:12:52,756
What now?

2074
02:12:53,598 --> 02:12:55,828
Banta, there's no use stopping now.

2075
02:12:56,134 --> 02:12:58,068
The cylinder's empty.

2076
02:12:58,870 --> 02:13:00,735
lf this is what's happening to us,..

2077
02:13:00,839 --> 02:13:03,273
..l'm afraid to think what
must be happening upstairs.

2078
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:37,403
Why are you laughing?

02:13:37,676 --> 02:13:39,507

02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:29,686
Brother.

2093
02:14:30,295 --> 02:14:31,387
Brother.

2094
02:14:31,563 --> 02:14:32,894
Aarush.
- Aarush.

2095
02:14:34,666 --> 02:14:36,293
How do you know my son-in-law?

2096
02:14:37,569 --> 02:14:39,298
He's the husband of my daughter.

2097
02:14:40,439 --> 02:14:41,633
Your daughter?

2098
02:14:42,474 --> 02:14:43,873
Yes, my daughter.

2099
02:14:47,312 --> 02:14:48,404
Come on.

2100
02:14:50,816 --> 02:14:51,874
Brother.

2101
02:14:51,983 --> 02:14:55,248
Brother. l want to
tell you the truth.

2102
02:14:55,520 --> 02:14:57,784
Aarush.
- Puja.

2103
02:15:03,328 --> 02:15:04,920
You bloody liar.

2104
02:15:06,431 --> 02:15:09,798
You didn't tell Sandy that
Puja is your ex-girlfriend.

2105
02:15:12,003 --> 02:15:14,494
What else are you hiding Aarush?

2106
02:15:15,307 --> 02:15:17,832
You cheater.
- No, no.

2107
02:15:17,943 --> 02:15:20,309
How dare you talk to
my son-in-law like that?

2108
02:15:22,280 --> 02:15:24,544
l'm not your son-in-law.

2109
02:15:24,883 --> 02:15:26,646
l'm not your son-in-law.

2110
02:15:26,852 --> 02:15:29,412
We're divorced.
- What?

2111
02:15:29,521 --> 02:15:32,581
You're laughing and
telling me such a serious thing?

2112
02:15:33,325 --> 02:15:36,590
So, you're also a divorcee?
- Yes.

2113
02:15:36,928 --> 02:15:39,226
What are you saying?

2114
02:15:39,431 --> 02:15:41,262
He's my son-in-law.

2115
02:15:41,366 --> 02:15:42,890
How can he be your son-in-law?

2116
02:15:43,001 --> 02:15:44,593
He's your son.

2117
02:15:48,340 --> 02:15:52,242
l'm his daughter and
he's not my husband.

2118
02:15:52,944 --> 02:15:54,468
Come here, scoundrel.

2119
02:15:54,746 --> 02:15:58,910
Tell me, how many
wives do you have?

2120
02:15:59,351 --> 02:16:01,376
l'll tell you, l'll tell you.

2121
02:16:03,388 --> 02:16:05,720
My wife is my wife.

2122
02:16:08,860 --> 02:16:11,624
Bob's wife is my wife.

2123
02:16:14,866 --> 02:16:17,426
Thankfully, you're not married to me.

2124
02:16:17,536 --> 02:16:20,528
Or else your wife
would've been my wife as well.

2125
02:16:23,375 --> 02:16:25,536
lf l didn't have so many wives..

2126
02:16:25,810 --> 02:16:29,610
..l would've married
your sister long back.

2127
02:16:32,651 --> 02:16:34,278
All that's fine.

2128
02:16:34,452 --> 02:16:37,615
But who is Bob's wife?

2129
02:16:37,956 --> 02:16:40,288
l'm Bob's wife.

2130
02:16:41,693 --> 02:16:42,921
That's terrible.

2131
02:16:43,028 --> 02:16:45,963
That's terrible.

2132
02:16:47,899 --> 02:16:54,498
Who is Bob?
- Papa, l'm Bob.

2133
02:16:56,942 --> 02:16:58,341
He's Bob..

2134
02:16:58,443 --> 02:16:59,501
That's terrible.

2135
02:16:59,611 --> 02:17:02,512
l have two sons-in-law.

2136
02:17:02,714 --> 02:17:05,080
And both are homos.

2137
02:17:05,917 --> 02:17:10,581
Oh, you're gay as well.
- l'm not gay.

2138
02:17:10,689 --> 02:17:12,054
l'm not gay.

2139
02:17:12,357 --> 02:17:14,052
Quiet. Quiet.

2140
02:17:14,359 --> 02:17:16,884
You're a homo as well.

2141
02:17:24,402 --> 02:17:26,962
l forgot about the main valve.
- Main valve?

2142
02:17:27,505 --> 02:17:30,030
lf l close the main valve
the inlet will be locked.

2143
02:17:30,141 --> 02:17:32,837
Close it quickly, Banta, do it.

2144
02:17:33,945 --> 02:17:35,469
Silence!

2145
02:17:36,648 --> 02:17:37,842
Silence!

2146
02:17:39,551 --> 02:17:42,384
l want to say something!

2147
02:17:46,057 --> 02:17:47,354
Brother.

2148
02:17:48,593 --> 02:17:54,725
When l tried to propose to Puja,
you hit me. l fell.

2149
02:17:59,604 --> 02:18:04,371
When l tried to get married,
l got divorced. Got divorced.

2150
02:18:04,843 --> 02:18:06,071
Cheers!

2151
02:18:08,013 --> 02:18:10,675
l tried to commit suicide,
Sandy saved me..

2152
02:18:11,182 --> 02:18:14,117
l got a new life.

2153
02:18:18,123 --> 02:18:20,921
And today.. when l came
here to tell you the truth..

2154
02:18:21,426 --> 02:18:24,953
..my secret was revealed
before l could reveal it.

2155
02:18:29,734 --> 02:18:32,862
And now.. now, look
l'm so unfortunate.

2156
02:18:33,772 --> 02:18:36,935
l want to express my sorrow.

2157
02:18:37,842 --> 02:18:40,777
But l'm laughing away.

2158
02:18:57,162 --> 02:19:00,825
Fate has always given me bad luck.

2159
02:19:05,904 --> 02:19:08,099
l'm just a bad omen.

2160
02:19:11,209 --> 02:19:14,838
l never had any
luck since childhood.

2161
02:19:20,218 --> 02:19:25,155
l am a jinx.

2162
02:19:26,257 --> 02:19:30,557
Just a loser. Just a loser.

2163
02:19:53,818 --> 02:19:56,252
l could've lied and married you.

2164
02:19:57,689 --> 02:20:02,217
But l'd rather tell
the truth and lose you.

2165
02:20:04,996 --> 02:20:06,520
Any home which is based on lies

2166
02:20:06,631 --> 02:20:07,996
..is not a home

2167
02:20:10,568 --> 02:20:12,502
Even though you mean
the world to me.

2168
02:20:12,737 --> 02:20:14,068
And you know it.

2169
02:20:19,911 --> 02:20:26,646
Sir. l'm a bad omen,
but not a liar.

2170
02:20:30,021 --> 02:20:31,283
l'm sorry, sir.

2171
02:20:32,957 --> 02:20:34,117
l'm sorry.

2172
02:20:37,195 --> 02:20:39,288
Brother, you're both
looking very nice.

2173
02:20:39,664 --> 02:20:40,892
Nice, happy family.

2174
02:20:42,233 --> 02:20:45,862
Will you protect me..

2175
02:20:46,905 --> 02:20:50,068
..just like my brother did
for so many years? - Yes.

2176
02:20:51,876 --> 02:20:53,571
l misunderstood you.

2177
02:20:54,312 --> 02:20:55,711
l'm really sorry.

2178
02:21:11,329 --> 02:21:13,820
You just said that you don't lie.

2179
02:21:15,066 --> 02:21:17,330
But you lied again while leaving.

2180
02:21:19,771 --> 02:21:22,763
Yes, it's a lie
that you're a jinxed

2181
02:21:23,975 --> 02:21:29,311
Because any man Sandy
loves can not be jinxed

2182
02:21:31,850 --> 02:21:33,078
You two aren't
getting engaged tomorrow..

2183
02:21:34,118 --> 02:21:35,312
..you two are getting married.

2184
02:21:36,621 --> 02:21:37,781
l've got my eyes on you.

2185
02:21:51,336 --> 02:21:59,869
''When someone finds true love..''

2186
02:22:00,211 --> 02:22:05,171
Papa, l don't have any left
right problem. - ls it? - Yes.

2187
02:22:06,818 --> 02:22:09,685
l have right left problem.

2188
02:22:09,787 --> 02:22:12,312
''..bad luck and jinx vanishes.''

2189
02:22:12,423 --> 02:22:15,688
Dear, it was my fault
that l didn't like Benny.

2190
02:22:15,793 --> 02:22:16,885
''The house is full of happiness.''

2191
02:22:16,995 --> 02:22:18,326
You won and l lost.

2192
02:22:18,429 --> 02:22:22,866
''There won't be any
bad luck, any longer.''

2193
02:22:23,134 --> 02:22:26,797
''lt's true.''

2194
02:22:26,905 --> 02:22:29,066
''He's not a loser.''

2195
02:22:29,173 --> 02:22:31,664
''No, not a loser.''

2196
02:22:32,043 --> 02:22:35,843
''He's such a winner.''

2197
02:22:36,347 --> 02:22:38,281
''He's not a loser.''

2198
02:22:38,383 --> 02:22:40,647
''No more a loser.''

2199
02:22:41,219 --> 02:22:45,383
''He's such a winner.''

2200
02:22:55,166 --> 02:22:56,292
Cut.

2201
02:22:58,970 --> 02:23:00,870
Cut.

2202
02:23:04,709 --> 02:23:08,975
''Friday the 13th is a bad omen.''

2203
02:23:09,213 --> 02:23:14,378
''He's jinxed, that's his fate.''
- Thank you.

2204
02:23:24,362 --> 02:23:30,062
Will you get such a husband who'll..
- Cut.

2205
02:23:34,238 --> 02:23:42,907
''But it's no match
for his birthday.''

2206
02:23:43,014 --> 02:23:47,451
''He's such bad-luck.''

2207
02:23:47,919 --> 02:23:51,446
''You'd never have come
across a loser like him.''

2208
02:23:51,756 --> 02:23:56,193
''No more a loser.''

2209
02:23:56,794 --> 02:24:00,423
''Everybody is a winner.''

2210
02:24:00,832 --> 02:24:03,130
Welcome to..

2211
02:24:03,534 --> 02:24:07,265
Welcome. Mama mia.

2212
02:24:08,473 --> 02:24:11,306
Happy birthday Sajid!

2213
02:24:19,517 --> 02:24:21,109
Drinks for everybody.
