1
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,626
This is the story about those days
when people had happy families.

2
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,706
And their seperation has become
a fashion,

3
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,975
But thier seperation ways are
very strange.

4
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,218
Seperation in fair was
a common thing,

5
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,986
Few families got seperated
on railway stations,

6
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,486
Mothers had competetion to lost
their kids.

7
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,865
Few kids were abducted by villains
for revenge.

8
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:21,539
And some were abducted by
helpless fathers.

9
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:27,839
But we must have an happy ending
of every sad story,

10
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:36,178
that's why every seperated family
meet again after long years.

11
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,585
And their family is one of
it's kind.

12
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,991
Have you done your breakfast?

13
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:54,389
Pa! My friend is going to India
along with his family.

14
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,861
When we will go to India?
We will go,

15
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:58,231
Sure?

16
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,371
But don't tell your mom,

17
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,644
Otherwise she will beat you,

18
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,146
you always put me in trouble.

19
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,714
Now I can't have my breakfast.

20
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,784
Listen to me carefully.

21
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,895
We are definitely not
going to India.

22
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:32,196
I want that our kids go to India
and learn our culture.

23
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,610
Indian neighbours took stuff and
never returns.

24
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,166
Don't abuse.

25
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,706
you have turned them bad,

26
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,878
Because you always lived
with your father.

27
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,857
Where is my milk?

28
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,261
Always blah blah blah....

29
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,407
Where did I get stuck?

30
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,672
How are you Dharmendra?

31
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,173
Call me Dev.

32
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,718
yes mom!

33
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,679
I want some groossery...
Tell me.

34
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,122
Don't forget punjabi newspaper.

35
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,426
Green tea and coffee for your wife.

36
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:07,663
Biscuits for kids.

37
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:22,546
you are watching english movie.
I am not watching movie.

38
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,923
If their mothers would have teach them
lesson in their childhood.

39
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,430
then he won't do this thing.

40
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:29,646
Here is your newspaper.

41
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,515
your wife mood is very bad,

42
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,745
I narrated her fewjokes in punjabi.

43
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,818
My finger!
Come over here.

44
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,662
He is my son Paramveer.

45
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,304
She is preetu,

46
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,570
And he is her Preetam,

47
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,903
They just came from Punjab,

48
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,247
They want to write application
in English.

49
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,139
you write for them,

50
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,684
And she is Neelo.

51
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,388
She got married a white boy
like you,

52
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,492
They needed loan,
I told them....

53
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:19,054
My son works in bank,
He will get you loan,

54
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,029
Where they will face problems?

55
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,529
So please you get them loan.

56
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:54,998
I will tell you.

57
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,428
Six months back Bob went to Banaras,

58
00:08:59,105 --> 00:08:59,867
alone...

59
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:03,972
And there this man and his son

60
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,045
get him jump to Ganga to get rid
of all sins,

61
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,810
So he have to return in underwear.

62
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,488
So, he didn't reform till today.

63
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:29,493
Because of these acts I left your papa

64
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:33,469
and decided to come Canada.

65
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,335
But before....

66
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,908
I would bring both of you here.

67
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:45,646
One night he went disappeared
with you brother,

68
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,445
and today....

69
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,251
He made your younger brother
like himself.

70
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:00,455
No!

71
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,201
you did right whatever you did.

72
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:05,996
I didn't do right.

73
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:11,775
Since many years your younger
brother didn't get mother's love.

74
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,547
If he would be with us,

75
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,308
then he wouldn't gone bad.

76
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,192

77
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,559

78
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,223
Don't know how he would be,

79
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,596
Take me to them,

80
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,163

81
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,442

82
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,182

83
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:47,615

103
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,527
Think it's for my wife.

104
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:07,871

105
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,600

He is saying that he is in office but

00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,002
He want to give surprise to his wife,

114
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,940
Sons give surprises and father
pays the prices.

115

I will pay the bill.

116
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,546

123
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,417

00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,880
Take care of him,
Don't worry,

125
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,850
you make fun with your grandpa.

126
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,468
It's been so long your grandpa
didn't come yet.

127
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,230
He is not my grandpa.

128
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,499
I am an orphan,

129
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,869
He told me keep 2000 and speak
some dialogues.

130
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,036
And I spoke,

131
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,245
He made me fool,
Why did I trust them?

132
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:57,000
I will give it to her,
Do you have any girlfriend?

133
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,768
She is some....
She is some item,

134
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,506
Don't call her item,

135
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:10,210
you shouldn't give expensive gifts
to girls.

136
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,081
I still work with flowers.

137
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:17,955
you are such a rascal.

138
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,698
Greetings! How are you?
I am fine,

139
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,105

00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,136

141
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,869
and give me some tomatoes.

142
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,878
Give me two bottle of water.

143
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:45,740
how much?

144
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,055
How much?
I can't get money from you,

145
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,655
Strange people.

146
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,323
Why nobody is taking money from me,
Banaras is like that.

147
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,358
Keep it.

148
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,535
I mean...

149
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,798
To see girls...
Not actually girls...

150
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:45,635
but to see you,

151
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,544
My english become pink,

152
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:49,977
How cheap?

153
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:52,374
Nonsense!

154
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:56,977
I got this cloth from new market.

155
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,015
and she is calling it cheap.

156
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,655
She don't understand my standard,

157
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,655
When this exchange will open,
Don't know.

158
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,257
It's closed from few days.

159
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,905
When did you come from Punjab?
It's been so long to see you,

160
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,101
I think you have some
mis-understanding,

161
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,038
Amazing!

162
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:57,976
your face,

163
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,947
looks like my friend Balbeer's
brother Baljeet,

164
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,788
My mistake,
Forgive me,

165
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:08,958
May I ask you one thing,

166
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,788
I hope you won't mind,
yes.

167
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,794
Why are you gazing this shop?

168
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,532
I forgot to convert my currency
on airport.

169
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,832
Don't talk about dollars loudly.

170
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:26,239
Somebody will rob you.

171
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,104
Do one thing,

172
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,480
Keep it and return me later.

173
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,378
As you wish.

174
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:39,387
Can you help me?

175
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,323
I want to convert few dollars
into rupees.

176
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:46,226
Let me think.

177
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:50,059
I have a friend,
One minute.

178
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,500
Lokesh! how are you?

179
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:58,400
Everything is fine,

180
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:02,103
A friend of mine came from Canada.

181
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,040
He wants to exchange dollars.

182
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:09,053
Not pounds it's dollars.
Canadian Dollars.

183
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:12,882
One second,

184
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,922
How much you want?
For 2000.

185
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:18,759
We want for 2000.

186
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,698
It will be done,
Okay! take them out,

187
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,361
We are coming,
your job is done,

188
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,162
And your commission?

189
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,005
What are you saying?

190
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:32,504
you are like my friend Baljeet,
I can't take commission from you,

191
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,475
Actually Banaras is like that.

192
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:38,540
Take it.

193
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,143
Have Banarasi betel leaf.

194
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,790
you NRI people are amazing,

195
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,893
you didn't eat betel leaf and
said thanks,

196
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,058
In fact we don't say thanks after
snatching it.

197
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,861
Tell me how come you are in Banaras?

198
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,732
30 years back my father and brother
seperated from us.

199
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,240
I found out that they are in Banaras.

200
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,170
I have come to take them,

201
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:11,571
What happen?

202
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,611
I think you watch Indian movies.

203
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:15,249
Here we are.

204
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:20,881
Lokesh! What's up?
Everything is fine,

205
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,728
Count them,

206
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:43,713
What are you doing?

207
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,045
Tie them properly.
Okay!

208
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,142
Now you are saying thanks
on right time,

209
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,908
So, I am leaving,
May I drop you somewhere?

210
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,085
Fine! but I am glad to meet you,

211
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:26,585
Keep meeting,

212
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:30,055
And if you have any problem then
call me,

213
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:47,936
you are again,

214
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,011
I wanted another help from you,
Really!

215
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,906
Only human helps another human,

216
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:56,118
Have you seen him?

217
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:01,817
He is Dharmendra.
He looks like him,

218
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:03,822
But his name is Dharam Singh.

219
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:08,958
Where did you get this photo?

220
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,729
My mom gave me,

221
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,702
your mother also have a photo.

222
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,634
What did you say?
He was such a bastard.

223
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,803
Last year he committed suicide on
railway track.

224
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:20,807
Keep it back.

225
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:27,177
He also have a son,
He have many sons.

226
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:28,250
I am leaving,

227
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:37,491
Bob told me that he met him
six months back.

228
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,453
Do you know this man?
He is Dharam Singh,

229
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:13,060
Where I will find him?
you can find him in beer bar.

230
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:24,540
Have you seen him?

231
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,801
you are looking hot?

232
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:23,824
What's the matter Sardar?
you are crossing the limits.

233
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:27,104
I am Paramveer.

234
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:28,970
your son,

235
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,511
Can you see this sardar is my son,

236
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:44,812
Someone said the right...

237
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,768
This is your photo,
My mom gave me,

238
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,233
When I was young,

239
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:07,434
Every girl kept my photo under
her pillow before sleeping,

240
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:10,579
Keep it carefully.

241
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,051
you must recognize her.

242
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,050
She is my mom,

243
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,573
you are such a dramatic,

244
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:39,241
She is your mom,

245
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,769
you are my son and I am her husband.

246
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,381
What a story?

247
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:50,853
I have only one son and his name
is Gajodhar.

248
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:53,889
Behind this story if you have
any plans....

249
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:55,784
then your plan won't work here.

250
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:59,089
Because I am the king of
all cheaters.

251
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:01,525
Come have come drink.

252
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:12,440
Sardar remove my booze.

253
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:14,367
Make me a bigger drink.

254
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,312
What happen?

255
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,718
That jeweller whom we stole jewellery.
He is dead?

256
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,426
No! he brought some men to beat us.

257
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:35,396
Where did he come from?

258
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:39,031
How do you know him?
He is same NRI,

259
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,698
from whom I got dollars.

260
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:48,743
I have more dollars.

261
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:02,552
Here we are!
Today I have come to fix the account,

262
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,386
We will also fix your geometry.

263
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,265
I am Marwari.
I know fighting,

264
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:13,001
I have come to do or die,
If this is your wish then...

265
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:18,037
My son will beat all of you alone.

266
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:19,543
Have you gone mad?

267
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:21,570
Can't you see they are many.

268
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:28,749
Fighting is useless.

269
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:32,979
Now you have brought bat and hockey
stick I will bring the ball.

270
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:36,092
Let's solve this matter with game,
you are making fun with me,

271
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:39,794
How are you come to my area?

272
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,262
Only dogs have areas,

273
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,128
Not for lions....

274
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,372
Human is the sculture of mistakes.

275
00:31:58,549 --> 00:31:59,982
If these sculpture made a mistake,

276
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,185
then I'm applogizing from their behalf.

277
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:04,049
He is right.

278
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:05,855
Who are you?

279
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,954
How could I praise for myself?

280
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:11,553
He is asking your introduction,

281
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:18,192
And he...

282
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:21,795
He is my father and he is my
younger brother.

283
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,244
When did you went to Punjab,
Shut up!

284
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,475
This is the new way to cheat people.

285
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,314
They cheated me,

286
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:39,550
I gave them every necklace
from my own hands.

287
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,295
I am telling you that I am his brother
and his son,

288
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:47,859
you think I am joking,

289
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:55,863
If I will become angry,

290
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:57,834
then I will beat you like...

291
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:02,176
Nor any medicine will help.

292
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:04,513
Nor any blessings.

293
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:07,377
Think about it.

294
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:55,007
I gave you money to beat them
not to beaten from them,

295
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,378
you put me in double expense.

296
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:02,715
Where you have been since
many years.

297
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:04,850
I told you...

298
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:07,119
you looks anyone's brother.

299
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:11,221
But you're not Balbeer's brother
but mine,

300
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:16,462
that's why....

301
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,168
you recieved me with love.

302
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,632
Human is the sculpture of mistakes.

303
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,309
This sculpture also made a mistake.

304
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,372
you are very dramatic,

305
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,347
However I am but I am your brother.

306
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:38,584
We both looks like brother.

307
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,286
From today....

308
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:42,993
He will work with us,
Not at all.

309
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,196
Nobody will work with us.

310
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,662
I will be back in a minute.

311
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,104
Have you got heart attack
of your brain,

312
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:59,235
your face looks like his father.

313
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,068
Let's take an advantage,

314
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:06,647
I think he is a fraud,

315
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:11,520
He think we are his brother
and father.

316
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:13,748
If we are not then let's become,

317
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,253
you make him son,
It's our benefit.

318
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:22,131
Our brain and his strength.

319
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,507
We will rob the world.

320
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,205
But one day he will rob us.

321
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:35,501
I am not gonna take him along.

322
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,578
you don't take tension,

323
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:45,885
Dharam's mood is off.

324
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,791
But tomorrow he will be fine,

325
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,425
Keep in touch,

326
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,435
I met them both,

327
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,764
How are you?

328
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:06,073
did you met them?

329
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:09,110
yes, but....
But what?

330
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:11,473
They are very bad,

331
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:14,379
In fact he refused to recognize me,

332
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:16,443
and,

333
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,722
He didn't tell Gajodhar about us,

334
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:20,649
How is your brother?

335
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:22,951
He is good.

336
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:24,417
But...

337
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:26,586
He is like papa.

338
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,397
Don't go bad with him,

339
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:33,158
How would I?

340
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:34,997
I am your son,

341
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:44,341
Lawyer tell him that I have 10 more
banglows in this city.

342
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:46,280
Take anyone what he like.

343
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:54,019
Now papers are prepared as
per your request, you can't deny,

344
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,723
I have to deal with both parties.

345
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,325
My father got married here.

346
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:03,698
Every brick is saying that don't
sell me,

347
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,495
Don't over act party will flee.

348
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,967
Advance money is ready as per
you want, 3 million,

349
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:11,797
I have brought advance money,

350
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:14,906
Today is Tuesday,

351
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:17,644
I don't touch money on tuesday.

352
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:18,840
Okay don't touch it.

353
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:36,628
Push the car my voice will be fine,

354
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:39,432
I got a cheap deal.

355
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:42,766
Seth thinks himself smart.

356
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:49,905
It's a school.
Show me the file.

357
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:59,014
How many times I told you don't
bring the old car.

358
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,215
Leave the clutch,
I can't....

359
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,017
you have put the examinaiton paper
instead of stamp paper.

360
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,754
I have a factory of fake papers.

361
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,622
Nowadays you are not paying
attention in business.

362
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,988
What about that mistake what you
have done last time,

363
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:40,295
I saved youe life,
I brought a car.

364
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,865
Nobody said thanks,

365
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:45,528
you saved us today,

366
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,538
I think you Dharam don't like
my timing,

367
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,766
It's not like that,
you owe us.

368
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,234
Ask what do you want?

369
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,041
Partnership!
Accepted!

370
00:41:57,214 --> 00:42:00,240
Partnership for what?

371
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:03,983
Our business is good going and he
wants partnership for jeep.

372
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:08,623
Who saved you life in bar?
And again today.

373
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,783
I think it's my job to save your lives,

374
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:12,193
He is right,

375
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,821
Ask you Dharam, why he is not
agreed with partnership.

376
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:18,668
Give me your hand,

377
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,864
From today you will work with us,

378
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:29,176
I can do anything to achieve you,

379
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,245
Our pair will rock,

380
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:09,685
What happen?
I am in love.

381
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:15,128
I love you since your childhood.

382
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:17,695
Not with you,
With her.

383
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:29,939
What's the name?
Gajodhar!

384
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:31,673
Her name is Gajodhar,

385
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,310
No! Sahiba.

386
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:40,213
She is pretty like her name,

387
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,991
What she is doing here?

388
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,689
Can't you see?
She is taking photos,

389
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:50,864
She is writing a book on banaras.

390
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:54,331
Did she got my Gajodhar's photo,
Don't embarass me,

391
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:55,900
Go away from here,

392
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:02,239
What else you know about her?
She is Sardarni,

393
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:08,751
How do you know?

394
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:11,884
I can recognize Sardarnis from miles.

395
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,897
I mean she is a nice girl.

396
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:27,396
What's the problem?

397
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:30,799
If you like her then what's
the problem?

398
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,735
I can't tell her my feelings,

399
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:40,012
I can't see your condition,

400
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,480
I know how to talk with girls.

401
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:44,649
I will talk to her and fix your matter.

402
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:00,663
I want to talk to you,

403
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,599
yes!
What he is telling her?

404
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:08,709
That guy is showing style in goggles.

405
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:14,114
He is saying that he loves you alot.

406
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:16,143
I tried to explain him,

407
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:19,518
This is not a girl like others,

408
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:23,288
I want to tell you something,

409
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:32,191
He is a thief, thug...

410
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,331
and he speaks water like lie.

411
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:37,899
I mean he speaks lie like water,

412
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:41,104
But he loves you alot.

413
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:45,341
Now I have expressed his feelings
to you,

414
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:47,081
Now what's in your heart?

415
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:51,485
you tell him from your self.

416
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:56,326
It will be better for me to leave
this situation,

417
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,128
Dharam must have told you about
my feelings,

418
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:24,951
I am a thief....

419
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:33,757
What else I do?

420
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:38,529
you are drunk,

421
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,363
By chance if you will miss your aim,

422
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,199
then my head will blow up.

423
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,841
And you didn't feel anything while
you were blowing my heart.

424
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,900
you are talking about your head.

425
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:54,716
Don't move otherwise I will
blow your face.

426
00:50:56,953 --> 00:51:00,548
I think you have forgotten my
golden principles.

427
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:04,417
I told you have fun but don't
fall in love.

428
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:07,729
Did you ever seen any married
man happy?

429
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:09,425
I am happy,

430
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,402
you always interfere.

431
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:18,266
you want to win girl's heart?
What's the problem?

432
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:19,569
It will be done,

433
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:22,441
He finished my love story
before it begins,

434
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:31,251
I will jump down and die,

435
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,090
Those days are gone,

436
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,354
When matter were get solved to
climb up on tanks.

437
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:49,799
I can help you out,

438
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:54,636
your all mistakes get forgiven when
you talk from the bottom of your heart,

439
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:58,713
you need courage to talk,

440
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:03,851
Am I right?

441
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:09,616
As much you will make relations,

442
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:12,486
you will get sorrow when they
will break up as well.

443
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:15,189
you didn't broke any relation,

444
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:18,394
Then how could you realize that pain,

445
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:28,303
For the beginning of new relation,

446
00:52:53,136 --> 00:52:54,228
you just said come in,

447
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:56,168
Why are you getting angry?

448
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:01,705
This is for you,

449
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:04,037
What's this?
Friendship cards.

450
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,048
Keep anyone whatever you like,

451
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:12,787
you keep all of them,

452
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:18,059
Dharam gave wrong impression
of mine,

453
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:21,858
I also got you a gift.

454
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:25,700
Brinjels?
Total 2 kg.

455
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:27,264
you like them,

456
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:30,265
Mostly I saw you buying them,

457
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,144
I am giving present to some girl.

458
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:38,113
I am little bit nervous,

459
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:47,753
I like Punjab,

460
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,385
Sometimes I feel....

461
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,354
that I was also Punjabi in last birth,

462
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,832
Nice place!
I went there few times,

463
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,394
you are not from Punjab,
No!

464
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:03,096
I am from Calcutta.

465
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:07,738
I have seen his all movies.

466
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:11,810
I was joking,

467
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:13,680
I am from Gujrat.

468
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:22,817
Why don't you decide that
what do you like?

469
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:24,824
Why don't you decide that
where you from?

470
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:54,687
He brought brinjles for girl.

471
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:59,218
Somebody bring brinjels to
impress a girl.

472
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:05,797
I don't have diploma that what you
should give present a girl.

473
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:09,062
And you were gone like this?
Why?

474
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,304
What's wrong with me?

475
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:14,643
you will have to change your style.

476
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:18,347
He won't get a rentle girlfriend.

477
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:27,015
What you couldn't do

478
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:30,120
my brother will do for me,

479
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:36,160
He also have something missing,

480
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:39,428
He don't drink.

481
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:45,007
Beer doesn't suit my system,

482
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:10,695
I drunk once,

483
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:18,538
One day I got drunk and,

484
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:21,868
hijack the elevator.

485
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:46,568
you are an amazing guy,

486
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,504
you drink milk,

487
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:53,806
you are also amazing,

488
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:57,512
I wish we both would have grown
up together.

489
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:00,342
you are talking about grown up,

490
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:02,678
My childhood didn't over yet,

491
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:06,145
Forget about me but my Dharam....

492
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:10,154
his childhood didn't over yet,

493
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,658
He still behave like youngsters.

494
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:23,763
you are my everything,

495
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:28,040
My mom and my father.

496
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,541
Where is your mom?

497
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:39,421
He is my mom,
your real mom,

498
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:45,159
Don't know,

499
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:48,329
She left us,

500
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:02,178
He spoiled my mood,

501
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:22,761
you didn't tell him anything,

502
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:27,132
Don't worry,

503
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:29,629
I won't tell him either,

504
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:37,074
But I will must take you and
Gajodhar to mom,

505
00:58:57,433 --> 00:59:00,300
Take our photo too,

506
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:07,207
I have got photo on your neck,

507
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:09,709
you also want one,

508
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:15,678
I don't like violence,

509
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:18,044
But I can't tolerate nonsense,

510
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:21,953
If somebody will mis-behave then
violence is necessary,

511
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:29,358
Am I looks smart?

512
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,968
Actually somebody said your heart
is good or not,

513
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:37,935
but your face and clothes should
be good.

514
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:45,771
What's this?
Read it.

515
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:10,769
I am graduate,

516
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:28,052
What's this?
My character certificate,

517
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:34,057
I have got in college.

518
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:37,598
Now college teacher won't
write lie.

519
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:43,599
My heart is very good,

520
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,506
Lever, Kidney would have problems,

521
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:02,634
What's the matter?

522
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:06,407
I was thinking about us,

523
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:09,066
This is good,

524
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:13,411
But think with love why
with sadness,

525
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:15,814
you don't know my brothers,

526
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:19,313
I don't then I will.

527
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:23,023
They will never agree.

528
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:24,927
Why these brothers....

529
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:27,660
always interfere in every
love story,

530
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:34,129
From centuries Sahiba's brothers
were against her love.

531
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:37,903
And may be this time too.

532
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:44,037
you don't looks older.

533
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:49,213
It's an old love story of Punjab,

534
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:50,513
Mirza Sahiba!

535
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:54,821
I heard first time some guy name
before a girl name,

536
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:58,450
Otherwise Laila Majnu, Heer Ranjha,

537
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:00,689
Mirza was some kind of guy,

538
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:04,196
Mirza and Sahiba were
childhood friends,

539
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:08,361
And when they grown up their
friendship becomes loves,

540
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:13,573
But Sahiba's brothers didn't like
this relation,

541
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:19,047
It means Mirza sung a song and died
front of Sahiba's house.

542
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,784
Mirza wasn't like other lovers.

543
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:30,119
Sahiba wrote a letter to Mirza.

544
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:33,026
and told him if you are a real man,

545
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:34,824
then elope me,

546
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:38,967
And Mirza eloped Sahiba on her
marriage day,

547
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:41,527
This Mirza is an amazing guy,

548
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:44,136
Otherwise who got a girl
after death,

549
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:47,100
you must have to elope her,

550
01:05:48,978 --> 01:05:50,707
Sahiba's brother were follwing them,

551
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:54,648
When Mirza was taking rest
under the tree.

552
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:58,017
Then Sahiba saw her brothers
are coming,

553
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:02,922
Now on one side it was her love and
another side her brothers.

554
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,125
Sahiba knew one thing,

555
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:08,152
If Mirza will woke up,

556
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:10,955
then he will kill all his brothers.

557
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,297
Sahiba thought she will appease
her brothers.

558
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:20,068
And she broke all his arrows.

559
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:23,936
But her brothers didn't listen to her,

560
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:26,578
And they attacked on Mirza.

561
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:30,048
And When Mirza woke up

562
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,810
and picked up his bow to fight
with them,

563
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,686
then he found out Sahiba's act,

564
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,561
And Mirza lost his life.

565
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:47,093
Amazing lover!

566
01:06:48,904 --> 01:06:50,030
But one thing is confirm,

567
01:06:51,273 --> 01:06:54,538
These girls always take their
lover's life.

568
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:58,072
Girls have to take all
difficult decisions.

569
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:01,048
If Sahiba's brother would die,

570
01:07:01,717 --> 01:07:03,184
then world would curse Sahiba,

571
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,787
Sahiba got killed her brothers.

572
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,384
So today's Sahiba

573
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:14,527
have to choose Mirza or his brothers

574
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,063
then who she will choose?

575
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,875
Wait!
Let me see the guy.

576
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:25,686
Why you are so upset?

577
01:09:26,762 --> 01:09:29,788
Let's go home,
We will drink beer,

578
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:31,589
And our mood will be fine,

579
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:34,600
Everything is finished Dharam,

580
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:38,605
I have to go to Sahiba,

581
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:40,971
nothing is over,

582
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:44,773
I will bring you another girl.

583
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:11,967
Gajodhar is broken,

584
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:18,146
I can't see him cry,

585
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:23,410
I always made mock of his love.

586
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:28,620
you can help him,
What can I do for him?

587
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:31,120
He have faith in you,

588
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:34,123
If you want you can do everything,

589
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:36,463
Why should I help him?

590
01:10:44,106 --> 01:10:46,438
Because you are his brother,

591
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,645
you are my son,

592
01:10:57,453 --> 01:10:58,750
I want to hear it from you,

593
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:17,630
If you wouldn't ask me,

594
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:20,372
I would still help him,

595
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:24,442
I trust you,

596
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:27,682
Promise me,

597
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:32,587
you won't tell this truth to Gajodhar,

598
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:40,254
He was 2 months old,

599
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:43,424
When I took him away,

600
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,937
I committed a big sin to take
him away from his mother,

601
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:54,375
If Gajodhar will know this thing,

602
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:56,644
he will start hating me,

603
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:58,972
He will leave me,

604
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,476
I couldn't tolerate this shock.

605
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,684
Don't tell him,
I won't tell him,

606
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,351
you will come once to
meet mom,

607
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:12,023
To your mom,

608
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:17,559
How would I face her?

609
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:20,399

610
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:54,961
Let's go,
Where?

611
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:57,333
To bring your Sahiba,

612
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:08,277
How would be bring her

613
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:41,176

Mother is ill... and father?

01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:22,219

725
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:40,403

728
01:24:03,204 --> 01:24:05,832
Dont mind but more litrated person
can't be good husband.

729
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:08,067

730
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:12,774

731
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:18,281
We just want to get it over fast.

732
01:24:21,456 --> 01:24:22,753
where are you living right now

733
01:24:26,027 --> 01:24:28,291
The guest of punjab never lives in hotel.

734
01:24:28,863 --> 01:24:33,095
Babbu jee..
bring their luggage from hotel.and put on cottage

735
01:24:54,722 --> 01:24:56,280
That's your house

736
01:25:03,498 --> 01:25:05,728
If you want something so

01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:10,466
the thing I wanted..
so I'll take it

738

what you did fool..

739
01:25:16,377 --> 01:25:17,935
Who's telling you to get married.

740
01:25:20,815 --> 01:25:24,273
If you'd say no to marriage.
so We'll go to banaras again

741
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:27,618
I just was needed the excuse
of staying here.

742
01:25:29,224 --> 01:25:31,522
to seeing the chance ..
I'll elope with my sahiba..

743
01:25:34,596 --> 01:25:38,430
ITs not good..
we should tell them truth.

744
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:44,661
Its punjab..they shoots first..
then talks with coprse

01:25:45,206 --> 01:25:46,605

01:26:32,554 --> 01:26:34,920
Tell your brother ..

01:27:03,017 --> 01:27:03,949

762
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:57,233
Jugindar is thinking good for you

763
01:28:08,182 --> 01:28:12,118

770
01:32:56,037 --> 01:32:57,937
The wedding can't be done

you're so innocent.

783
01:34:15,983 --> 01:34:21,387
To seeing you..I'm recalling all the
romantic destinations of canada.

784
01:34:22,957 --> 01:34:25,653
just like niagra falls.

785
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:44,275
I want to show you something more.

786
01:34:46,847 --> 01:34:47,711

01:35:49,944 --> 01:35:50,876
is for one man?

790
01:35:53,481 --> 01:35:54,778
But doesn't suits my system

791
01:35:55,549 --> 01:35:57,813
the lovers used to drink poison,
its just a milk.

792
01:36:00,454 --> 01:36:01,216
drink it.

793
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:04,915
If you dont want to drink..
so just sip it..

794
01:36:24,712 --> 01:36:25,542
do you want something else.

795
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:32,150

796
01:36:36,190 --> 01:36:37,521

01:36:38,959 --> 01:36:41,154

01:36:43,330 --> 01:36:44,388
just give me some pratha's

799
01:36:44,965 --> 01:36:46,990

Just give me butter..

801
01:36:52,339 --> 01:36:58,141
I recalled something of sahiba's name.
the mirza sahiba story is writing again

802
01:37:00,981 --> 01:37:02,175
for new generation

803
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:04,841
so they'll spoil it.

804
01:37:05,986 --> 01:37:08,147
We should change the story
with the time..

805
01:37:08,989 --> 01:37:11,287
As Devdas have to become dev-d

806
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:17,662
I heared that mirza eloped with
sahiba in the story

807
01:37:19,033 --> 01:37:20,728
But they gets married..

808
01:37:28,609 --> 01:37:31,169
The storys intresting part is
when lover dies.

809
01:37:52,433 --> 01:37:53,400
its amazing.

810
01:37:54,635 --> 01:37:56,000

811
01:38:01,308 --> 01:38:02,297

812
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:40,312

our sister is getting married
with N.R.I..

814
01:38:44,184 --> 01:38:45,549
Whole punjab should know it.

815
01:38:47,321 --> 01:38:50,518
The news paper used to
publish in foreing..we'll be honored

816
01:38:51,492 --> 01:38:55,053

01:38:57,464 --> 01:39:03,460

how can I do this..
I'm telling you to do this.

821

Our leaders are telling us to remove
the poverty..did anyone done it?

822
01:40:07,101 --> 01:40:09,592
Talk in english..
but they can't understand it.

823
01:40:10,738 --> 01:40:15,141
In our country..when someone
speaks in english,so they thinks he's true

824
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:22,475
So my bro-in-law will talk

He should elope?
why I should elope with sahiba?

941
01:55:40,366 --> 01:55:43,733
Who's telling you to elope with her..

942
01:55:44,904 --> 01:55:47,304
Alone.
its quite streight.

943
01:55:48,274 --> 01:55:50,970
If you'll escape..
they'll think that you're scared with marriage

944
01:55:51,678 --> 01:55:56,047
And I'll proove gajodar hero

948
01:56:41,694 --> 01:56:43,093

01:56:43,730 --> 01:56:44,719

01:56:50,370 --> 01:56:53,339
No...you just come with me.

952
01:57:08,721 --> 01:57:10,052
Its the in-laws car

953
01:57:11,224 --> 01:57:11,690
If anyhow mintys villagers will
come on our side so can win election

954
01:57:17,063 --> 01:57:18,553
Minte played a amzing trap

955
01:57:19,165 --> 01:57:21,224
He's making fool to his people to putting
10 sacks of sugar in his well..

956
01:57:22,068 --> 01:57:23,092
That I'm having sweet water
from my well

957
01:57:23,870 --> 01:57:25,963
That's the gods miracle.

958
01:57:26,873 --> 01:57:29,774
Drink the sweet water.

959
01:57:35,882 --> 01:57:38,009
The game has been spoiled

960
01:57:43,623 --> 01:57:47,150
May I say something..

961
01:57:48,261 --> 01:57:51,128

962
01:57:51,664 --> 01:57:52,824
So should I commit suicide?

963
01:57:58,204 --> 01:58:01,173
Its called the gods miracle.

964
01:58:02,708 --> 01:58:08,943
Its first time in history..
the liqour found in well

965
01:58:15,154 --> 01:58:17,714
its not liqour but medicine.

966
01:58:19,559 --> 01:58:24,462
Jogindar is blessed by God

967
01:58:25,198 --> 01:58:27,962
to whome the god choosed,
so you should choose him too

968
01:58:29,068 --> 01:58:31,195
And stamp on air plane

969
01:58:36,409 --> 01:58:38,343
They putted english liqour in well

970
01:58:40,646 --> 01:58:42,876
this is played by those N.R.I

971
01:58:44,183 --> 01:58:49,644
I'll teach them a lesson..
so their generation will remember

972
01:58:53,326 --> 01:58:56,625
Paramveer always used to tell us,
that karamveer has guts.

973
01:58:57,396 --> 01:58:58,988
But we took long time to understand it

974
01:59:00,032 --> 01:59:01,829
But you did amazing today

975
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:05,602
come sit.

976
01:59:11,010 --> 01:59:13,171
Paramveer wants to tell
you something more

977
01:59:15,414 --> 01:59:17,848
he can't gather courage
to tell you that..

978
01:59:19,352 --> 01:59:20,410
what he want to say

979
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:23,584
actually..

980
01:59:25,057 --> 01:59:27,890
our paramveer is afraid of marriage

981
01:59:29,695 --> 01:59:34,758
He's afraid that...
he escaped from here.

982
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:43,167
the wedding is very dangerous thing.

983
02:00:00,126 --> 02:00:01,457
you're so funny

984
02:00:11,404 --> 02:00:13,372
If paramveer escaped.
so who's behind you...his ghost?

985
02:00:23,049 --> 02:00:25,950
I've measured paramveer..

986
02:00:29,021 --> 02:00:31,114
Now..we want to tell you
something from our heart

987
02:00:32,191 --> 02:00:35,285

and we ain't habitual to hear..no

988
02:00:36,562 --> 02:00:38,086

989
02:00:39,365 --> 02:00:42,766

02:01:34,587 --> 02:01:37,021
Before some other trouble comes.

We stucked again..

02:03:14,487 --> 02:03:15,749
In the mid night..
so many peoples.

1004
02:03:24,630 --> 02:03:25,654
But we haven't his phone number.

1005
02:03:26,499 --> 02:03:27,523
she's saying to call him

1006
02:03:30,703 --> 02:03:31,727
She's shouting a lot

1007
02:03:33,706 --> 02:03:34,229
But what she's saying?

1008
02:03:40,112 --> 02:03:42,410
She's shouting in english

1009
02:03:43,315 --> 02:03:44,145
I'll bring her

1010
02:03:47,887 --> 02:03:50,685

1011
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:54,416
Why're you not going.

1013
02:04:04,503 --> 02:04:07,233
An mad woman is shouting
calling your name...go and see

1014
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:10,035
She's not mad..
but she's is wife with kids

1015
02:05:00,059 --> 02:05:00,684
just a minute..

1016
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:04,354
I heared you saying shut up to her

1017
02:05:05,097 --> 02:05:06,359
Why're you scolding that woman

1018
02:05:07,199 --> 02:05:12,102
The matter is that she's
our neighbour in vancouver

1019
02:05:12,972 --> 02:05:15,133
last year she lost her husband.

1020
02:05:15,941 --> 02:05:18,136
And she's finding her husband everwhere

1021
02:05:22,214 --> 02:05:24,045
I believe that your husband
name is paramveer...and llost

1022
02:05:25,584 --> 02:05:28,849
And its not mean that you awakes
all paramveer of punjab

1023
02:05:33,092 --> 02:05:36,653

02:05:52,811 --> 02:05:55,905
She's marry..

1026
02:05:56,515 --> 02:05:58,176
Her name is mary

1027
02:06:13,966 --> 02:06:16,400
she got two kids..
she's my sister.

1028
02:06:17,369 --> 02:06:19,860
She'll not go anywhere alone
in night..but live in our house

1029
02:06:35,788 --> 02:06:36,948
What did he called you?
pa

1030
02:06:37,590 --> 02:06:38,614
Pa means father/

1031
02:06:39,258 --> 02:06:40,987
so why he called pa

1032
02:06:42,661 --> 02:06:44,492
their fathers face similars to him

1033
02:06:46,165 --> 02:06:51,068
In the foreign..they never calls
anybody uncle or anything

1034
02:06:51,704 --> 02:06:52,898
They abreviates the names

1035
02:07:00,779 --> 02:07:02,713
They'll call a jogindar a joo

1036
02:07:11,924 --> 02:07:13,653
the youngsters will feel
good to voting me

1037
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:17,219
hence everybody will call me joo

02:07:26,839 --> 02:07:27,806
