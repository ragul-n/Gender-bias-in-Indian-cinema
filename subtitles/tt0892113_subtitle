Ripped by gdhaliwal23

2
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:11,548
Underlying the Indian ethos,
lies a strain of music,

3
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,691
ingrained as it were, in life's every
facet, from birth to death..

4
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:22,766
It's music, gracing every occasion..
from changing of season's winds,

5
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,904
to the festival of colors (Holi),
the Night of Light (Diwali),

6
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,937
seasons of sowing and harvest and
indeed, for life's every moment..

7
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:38,613
There is music to it. Music reached
its zenith during the reign of..

8
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:45,989
Emperor Akbar. The musician Tansen
was one of the gems in his court

9
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:53,465
It is believed that Tansen could
bring rain by singing Raag Malhar

10
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:57,428
And could light lamps
by singing Raag Deepak

11
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:02,499
'Reminiscent, my heart'

12
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:07,443
'Reminiscent, my heart'

13
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:12,484
'Reminiscent, my heart'

14
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:16,521
'Whatever pleasure you wish'

15
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,923
'Reminiscent, my heart'

16
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:42,044
'In bad times nobody is your friend'

17
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:50,149
'Foolish man does not understand'
'Reminiscent, my heart'

18
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:56,528
Aurangzeb's reign marked
music's decline

19
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:02,694
He believed, music distances
man from God

20
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,505
So he thought that it should
be strictly banned.

21
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:10,475
And Aurangzeb wrote a decree..

22
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:14,536
To stamp out music and musicians
from his regime

23
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,646
Hear one, hear all..

24
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,522
All eminent and common
people hear this.

25
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:25,684
By this royal decree..

26
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,494
Aurangzeb, the Conqueror
of the World,

27
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:34,557
...forbids in his realm
all song and music

28
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:39,504
Anyone singing songs, of whatever
kind be held captive..

29
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:44,567
...and may even be hanged

30
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,624
You dare to violate the royal
decree ? You are under arrest

31
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:13,198
Salah-uddin.. is my decree against
music being implemented ?

32
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:21,138
Majesty, it is being implemented. But
many a Sufi has run away from cities

33
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:25,709
Now in refuge in distant reaches,
they won't stop their sly rebellion

34
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:34,626
They are to be found and hanged.
- So it shall be done, Majesty

35
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,958
You foolish man,
I am giving you advice.'

36
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,966
'l am giving you advice.'

37
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,628
'You are asleep, but God is awake'

38
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:56,638
You are under arrest for violating
the royal decree

39
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:17,794
Who has died, whose
coffin do you bear ?

40
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:18,995
My Lord..

41
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:23,200
The Art of Melody

42
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,680
The Music that you
sentenced to death

43
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:28,806
That Music we go to bury

44
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,649
That infidel, so very astute..

45
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,652
...it seems to return to
life after every death

46
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:38,080
Make sure to bury him so deep that
it never raises its head again

47
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:52,228
The Great Akbar died

48
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,669
So also Aurangzeb passed

49
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:59,144
But the ban on music continued

50
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:08,683
In turn, Mohammed Shah Rangeela ruled
then, Nadir Shah invaded India

51
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:14,091
and Punjab, standing in
the way of every invader

52
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:16,059
was destroyed again and again

53
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:28,673
The one central power dis-integrated
and various rulers continued..

54
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:32,712
To suppress music in their own ways

55
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:46,289
Learned Master, has music
been buried forever ?

56
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:52,123
No, many Sufi masters keep it alive,
they will preserve music forever

57
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,298
And Allah has created
such circumstance..

58
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:58,929
...in the life of a person..

59
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:02,874

 can feel his coming.. to Kasoor,
searching for me..

60
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:10,177
He is the man, who shall bring
alive music upon this land

61
00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:12,209
That one,

62
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,483
even I am waiting for him,
impatiently

63
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,959
So long to journey's end

64
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,335
Sir..

65
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,537
Where may I find Mohi-u-ddin
Makhdoom sahib ?

66
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:56,258
You do not look like a madman, but
it's a crazy question you ask

67
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,027
What seek you of him ?

68
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,034
His kindness, I wish
to be his disciple

69
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:07,001

 see, you must be mad

70
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,203
He is a Muslim but he speaks
the language of infidels

71
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:13,574
He dares to call himself
a god. He sings, dances

72
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:19,013
His followers are likely to
incur the king's wrath..

73
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:24,657
Are you sticking your head out for
the hangman's noose ? Go back

74
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,063
For me, life and death are same

75
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,035
But say, where can
I find the Master?

76
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:42,975
After the king banned musicians,
these bards fled from cities..

77
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:49,277
To inhospitable terrain. If
you have run into bad times,

78
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,245
you may run into him in
the jungles of Kasoor

79
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:25,313
Makhdoom Baba
(Baba: Father, Master)

80
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:29,246
Makhdoom Baba!

81
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,930
Makhdoom Baba!

82
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:45,965
Makhdoom Baba!

83
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:53,272
Waaris..

84
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,242
Baba...?

85
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,439
So finally, you come ?

86
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:58,076
Yes, Baba

87
00:11:58,252 --> 00:11:59,276
Come

88
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:11,256
Welcome

89
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,428
Baba !

90
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,272
Waaris, how I waited for you

91
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:32,384
I regret your mother's passing

92
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:37,215
But unless the mother, the
one you loved the most..

93
00:12:37,658 --> 00:12:39,990
Had not left you alone
in this world,

94
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:45,158
were it not for your family
who ostracized you..

95
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,261
Would you have ever come to me ?

96
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:51,994
Baba, you know all about me ?

97
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:56,174
All that has come to pass
and all that is to come

98
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:57,400
Praise be to Allah

99
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:58,603
Waaris,

100
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:05,645
the world will remember me because
you have been my disciple

101
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:11,990
My Learned Master, despite all
my flaws, you accept me ?

102
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,017
Yes, come

103
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:20,293
From now, whatever was mine is yours

104
00:13:32,513 --> 00:13:36,040
Waaris, you are adept at poetry

105
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:40,649
But what you lack in, is passion,

106
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:44,622
your lyrics lack a certain pathos,

107
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:50,498
that reflection of personal
anguish, or the universal

108
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:56,062
Have you ever been in love ?

109
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,109
That's what's lacking

110
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:06,478
You can never make love come
to be, it only comes to be

111
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:10,106
It's God's gift

112
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:16,280
You've not known the joy of loving,
nor despair in longing

113
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:23,389
Learned Master, that means, I have
been drawing lines in water ?

114
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:29,102
In your time, you too shall
reap the riches of pathos

115
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:33,107
Until then, patience

116
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:36,501
I will, Baba

117
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:08,766
Who among you is Makhdoom ?

118
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:16,376
Faiyyaz Khan, so you have come ?
Then do your master's bidding

119
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:20,081
People of Kasoor say
you practise music..

120
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:23,088
...and you teach music,
you sing, dance..

121
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,488
And you even claim to be
a god ?Is that true ?

122
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:31,129
Faiyyaz Khan, in love, the
devotee attains Allah

123
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:36,163
When the veil is lifted from
your eyes, you too are God

124
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,199
You are under arrest

125
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:40,435
I know

126
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:45,468
Waaris, for the droplet to merge with
the Ocean, now comes the time..

127
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,474
For the lover to meet his beloved

128
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,344
Come on.

129
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:16,237
Untie him

130
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:31,214
Makhdoom, there's still time
for you to confess and repent

131
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:38,255
Tell your disciples, what
you spoke of was rebellion

132
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:42,361
I may still be kind upon you

133
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:45,670
I may spare your life

134
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:57,476
'The free spirit bows
not before might'

135
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:08,988
'Like free stars, in
skies of the night'

136
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:16,336
'Like a free river, running to seas'

137
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:20,634
'In the seas, end all mighty rivers'

138
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:30,075
'But oceans never flow into rivers'

139
00:17:38,459 --> 00:17:44,887
'The droplet mingles with seas,
the Ocean it becomes'

140
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:55,641
'The droplet mingles with seas,
the Ocean it becomes'

141
00:17:56,477 --> 00:18:02,849
'In loving embrace of Death,
freed the Spirit becomes'

142
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:10,479
'The droplet mingles with seas,
the Ocean it becomes'

143
00:18:17,498 --> 00:18:21,867
'The world is transient, what
is, will come to an end'

144
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:24,438
'Love, only love lives, it's
Allah's gift to us who live'

145
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:31,477
'The world is transient, what
is, will come to an end'

146
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:35,445
'Love, only love lives, it's
Allah's gift to us who live'

147
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:43,557
'l love so much, I even love Death'

148
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:52,658
'Then Death is no punishment,
if you have faith'

149
00:18:54,535 --> 00:19:02,535
'Then Death is no punishment,
if you have faith'

150
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:14,880
'The droplet mingles with seas,
the Ocean it becomes'

151
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:24,657
'In loving embrace of Death,
freed the Spirit becomes'

152
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,640
Amen! - Amen!

153
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:41,205
Right here, shall stand a memorial
to Baba Makhdoom and from afar..

154
00:19:41,882 --> 00:19:47,548
Men of all religions and creed
will travel here seeking solace

155
00:19:55,662 --> 00:20:00,293
Waaris Shah, this is my legacy.
Go forth to Malkahans..

156
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:04,470
And live there, amongst the people,
while you write the ballad, 'Heer

157
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:07,905
And until you have completed
your task, live there..

158
00:20:08,342 --> 00:20:11,437
For there still are those
who cherish music

159
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:01,892
'We are like kites,
soaring in skies.."

160
00:21:11,872 --> 00:21:15,968
'We are like kites,
soaring in skies.."

161
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:20,907
'We are like kites,
soaring in skies.."

162
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:25,383
'Until in a tie of strings,
are torn our ties, suddenly'

163
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:32,322
'What, o'what gain is there
in renting us apart ?*

164
00:21:32,493 --> 00:21:36,930
'what gain is there in
renting us apart ?*

165
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:41,229
'Like kites we are, in skies'

00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:45,971

'Oh how we wish we could
soar in open skies,'

00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:28,107
'Oh how we wish we could
soar in open skies,'

170
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:32,950
'where the blue is vast and
cool blows the breeze,

171
00:22:33,253 --> 00:22:37,588

'My heart trembles, what o 'what
gain is there in renting us apart ?"

175
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:03,142
'What gain is there in

00:23:12,693 --> 00:23:17,153
'We are like kites,

00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:40,452
'Rising from earth,

180
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:50,063
'rising from earth,

'Then suddenly mishap strikes,

00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:23,289
Pardon me, may I know how leads
the road to Malkahans ?

192
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:41,867
Oh rosy lips, that hide
the redden tongue,

193
00:25:48,482 --> 00:25:56,482
perched upon the perfectly
shaped face

194
00:25:59,092 --> 00:26:01,993
Teeth like jasmine buds,

195
00:26:02,363 --> 00:26:05,333
your smile betrays pearls

196
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:22,672
Beauty, blossoming like the fruit
in the middle of deserts

197
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:31,815
Rano,

198
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:36,996
ask this stranger, does he flatter
your beauty or mine ?

199
00:26:38,332 --> 00:26:39,959
Rano-ji, I am Waaris Shah

200
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:44,563

 obey my master's command to travel
to Malkahans, to write my 'Heer"

201
00:26:47,307 --> 00:26:51,869
Rano ask him, is his Heer
more beautiful than I am ?

202
00:26:53,013 --> 00:26:57,075
Rano, remind her, she
is God's creation

203
00:26:58,852 --> 00:27:00,684
'Heer' is to be my humble creation

204
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:03,220
How can they compare ?

205
00:27:05,392 --> 00:27:07,121
Rano-ji..

206
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:09,759
You still haven't told me
what way to Malkahans

207
00:27:11,865 --> 00:27:14,732
Rano, but this stranger
stands right in Malkahans

208
00:27:15,502 --> 00:27:17,493
Ask him, where he has to go ?

209
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:19,797
Choudhary-saheb's house

210
00:27:20,507 --> 00:27:23,533
There ! And he's telling that
to Choudhary-saheb's daughter

211
00:27:24,778 --> 00:27:27,509
Rano, it's our duty
to help the traveler

212
00:27:28,015 --> 00:27:30,814
You get along, I'll show him the way

213
00:27:30,918 --> 00:27:31,976
Come

214
00:27:37,758 --> 00:27:40,750
In that case, you will
be a guest in my house

215
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:45,893
The mosque compound is the
right place to write 'Heer'

216
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:47,665
Whatever you prefer

217
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:49,626
As you wish.

218
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,062
Bhagpari..

219
00:27:51,772 --> 00:27:52,261
Yes ?

220
00:27:52,906 --> 00:27:55,603
You will take food to him,
twice a day

221
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:59,813
Father, ask him whether he'd
prefer to eat what I cook

222
00:28:00,614 --> 00:28:04,107
Well.. let me ask Rano

223
00:28:05,586 --> 00:28:06,610
Rano...?

224
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:10,648
Didn't you say, you're single ?

225
00:28:11,592 --> 00:28:13,492
Is Rano..

226
00:28:14,094 --> 00:28:16,529
I mean, are you married...?

227
00:28:17,498 --> 00:28:18,659
Rano, my goat

228
00:28:19,566 --> 00:28:21,500
On arrival, he made friends with her

229
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,304
May Allah so deign, that you bring
to eternal fame this place

230
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:37,181
I live right across, if you need
anything, do not hesitate

231
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:38,549
I am obliged, Imam-saheb

232
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:40,312
May God be with you
- God be with you

233
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,354
Do you realize, whom you have
given shelter ? An infidel

234
00:29:16,323 --> 00:29:20,783
This town will come to ruin. Drive
that Satan out of this town

235
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:26,165
Qazi-saheb, is this your writ,
or your personal opinion ?

236
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,868
Malik-saheb I am..

237
00:29:28,035 --> 00:29:36,035
In the name of the merciful
Lord I begin, thankfully,*

238
00:29:41,081 --> 00:29:49,081
'for out of love, He created
this Universe'

239
00:29:50,023 --> 00:29:57,362
'He is the first One who loved'

240
00:30:04,438 --> 00:30:12,438
"And His prophet was
in love with Him'

241
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:18,114
Brilliant

242
00:30:18,886 --> 00:30:24,791
Qazi, do you call this lover of
Allah's prophet an infidel ?

243
00:30:25,225 --> 00:30:30,322
Maybe the spies gave me wrong news..
but it's a song he sings, no ?

244
00:30:30,431 --> 00:30:35,801
Qazi, even the Muezzin's call to
prayer is rendered like a song

245
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:38,728
Music abounds in The Lord's creation,
in the chirping of birds,

246
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,933
...the cuckoo's song

247
00:30:41,108 --> 00:30:42,837
You'll imprison them all ?

248
00:30:52,186 --> 00:31:00,186
<i>"When Heer brings the delicacies
for her lover Ranjha,</i>

249
00:31:04,465 --> 00:31:10,461

00:31:17,878 --> 00:31:25,878
'when lovingly she feeds the
bread dipped in butter,'

"With the love, she cares for him,*

'Every emotion there

'she peels, reveals,

00:32:12,633 --> 00:32:13,998
Who are you ?

256
00:32:14,902 --> 00:32:16,028
What are you doing here,
at this time ?

257
00:32:17,738 --> 00:32:24,440
What I am.. is lost in the
magic of what you sing

Tell me when you remember

259
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:32,451
Also tell me, who I am

260
00:32:34,722 --> 00:32:37,020
Oh !I remember ! I am Bhagpari

261
00:32:37,658 --> 00:32:38,682
And you, Waaris Shah

262
00:32:41,395 --> 00:32:44,262

 came with supper, for you
- Put it down

263
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:47,498
I'll eat, when I'm hungry

264
00:32:52,573 --> 00:32:54,803
Are you asking me to leave ?

265
00:32:57,144 --> 00:32:58,771
How can a beggar ask you to leave ?

266
00:33:00,781 --> 00:33:03,716
Yes, you may ask me to leave

267
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:13,449
Abida, Nasreen, come ! Noora..
we girls should go to the mosque

268
00:33:13,627 --> 00:33:15,061
A magician has come to town,

269
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:19,497
in a melody and passionate poetry,
he talks about love. Quick!

270
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,624
Let's go

271
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:36,546
'Amongst her many friends
who come with her,"

272
00:33:37,551 --> 00:33:44,480
'her enchanting beauty
makes her vain'

273
00:33:44,658 --> 00:33:50,859
'Oh, the flashing vine-like
pearls in her ears'

274
00:33:57,104 --> 00:34:05,104
"Who gives he this
grace of angels ?*

275
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:10,075
Saabo...?

276
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:15,817
O'Saabo.. what for
have you come here ?

277
00:34:19,326 --> 00:34:25,322
Bhagpari, the waters, the winds, the
Sun and Moon and lores of love..

278
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,325
To all nature, all have equal claim

279
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:36,173
And it's been my habit from childhood
to do as I wish, to take what I wish

280
00:34:37,544 --> 00:34:39,842
Well Waaris-ji, what do you say ?

281
00:34:40,881 --> 00:34:42,280
If you ask that of a fakir

282
00:34:44,785 --> 00:34:46,412
what I am given, is my destiny

283
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:50,485
All else, is an unattainable
illusion in eyes

284
00:34:51,225 --> 00:34:53,853
When the light goes out.. and
who in world, knows when ?

285
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:57,729
Waaris Shah is the dispossessed,
a fakir

286
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:02,296
All strings are held in His
hands.. what Bhagpari ?

287
00:35:03,237 --> 00:35:05,501
You speak deep thoughts

288
00:35:06,473 --> 00:35:07,634
I shall leave

289
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:26,118
'Let never mysteries
of love be unraveled'

290
00:35:34,335 --> 00:35:42,335
'Let no one bespeak these mysteries'

291
00:35:47,648 --> 00:35:55,648
'True is the lover, who
bares not his pain'

292
00:36:02,229 --> 00:36:10,229
'and suffers in silence'

293
00:36:39,633 --> 00:36:42,466
O'poet.. even I can play that pipe

294
00:36:45,005 --> 00:36:46,939
This pipe is called a flute

295
00:36:48,509 --> 00:36:50,910
Music is not in the flute,
but in the person..

296
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:56,483
Who breathes music into it.
- Then, I'm bursting with music

297
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:00,149
Wait, hold Rano

298
00:37:00,988 --> 00:37:02,012
Pass me the pipe

299
00:37:03,223 --> 00:37:04,884
And hear me out

300
00:37:07,361 --> 00:37:07,827
In here...?

301
00:37:28,582 --> 00:37:32,348
Poet, why does the music
inside me not pour out ?

302
00:37:32,986 --> 00:37:35,956
The rapport between that music and
the flute must be established

303
00:37:37,091 --> 00:37:38,115
How so ?

304
00:37:56,343 --> 00:37:57,208
Like so

305
00:38:11,225 --> 00:38:16,163
When it touches your lips,
it sounds so sweet, why ?

306
00:38:17,264 --> 00:38:21,132
When it passed to me from your
lips I felt it sweet too

307
00:38:22,436 --> 00:38:23,460
Why ?

308
00:38:25,205 --> 00:38:28,140
The mysteries of nature
are revealed slowly

309
00:38:29,743 --> 00:38:32,178
Slowly then, it must
teach me so much

310
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:33,776
May I keep it ?

311
00:38:34,381 --> 00:38:35,678
Yes

312
00:38:37,451 --> 00:38:38,475
What cost ?

313
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:41,620
If you learn to play it it's
priceless. Else, worthless

314
00:38:44,324 --> 00:38:45,348

 see

315
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,486
I shall leave

316
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,592
Come Rano

317
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:07,540
'Secretly, Waaris Shah,
we must nurture our..

318
00:39:09,249 --> 00:39:11,240
...emotions from worldly people'

319
00:39:11,752 --> 00:39:12,776
Who...?

320
00:39:17,391 --> 00:39:20,725
Bhagpari.. at this odd hour ?

321
00:39:21,795 --> 00:39:25,231
I wondered what to give
in exchange for the pipe

322
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:30,201
Take.. my most precious possession

323
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:33,396
A dove ?

324
00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:39,170
This naughty thing is called
'Tattler' Every mischief of yours..

325
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,248
He will carry to me

326
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:46,353
Now, the next lesson
about the flute ?

327
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:47,679
Of course

328
00:39:58,232 --> 00:40:00,200
Blow into the hole, all your breath

329
00:40:35,502 --> 00:40:36,970
I shall leave

330
00:41:46,774 --> 00:41:51,336
Poet, rein the Tattler in. At
every chance, he flies to me

331
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:57,374
I'm writing Heer's tale, might
he be writing mine ?

332
00:41:59,386 --> 00:42:02,356
Can my name too figure
in the Tattler's tale ?

333
00:42:03,524 --> 00:42:06,459
Now stop writing and eat

334
00:42:08,662 --> 00:42:11,757
Your wish is my command

335
00:42:35,322 --> 00:42:42,422
"O'dove, my courier...!

336
00:42:45,632 --> 00:42:50,297
"O'dove, my courier...!

337
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:53,466
'For God's sake.."

338
00:42:53,574 --> 00:42:56,373
'For God's sake.."

339
00:42:56,944 --> 00:43:01,541
'You are the bird who
binds lovers together,'

340
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:06,852
'o'courier of passions
may you be forever'

341
00:43:07,688 --> 00:43:12,319
'o'courier of passions
may you be forever'

342
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:17,364
"O'dove, my courier...!

343
00:43:17,698 --> 00:43:19,928
'For God's sake.."

344
00:43:20,034 --> 00:43:23,334
'For God's sake.."

345
00:43:55,536 --> 00:44:00,406
'How can I ever thank you for

'In unions of traded hearts,
you have been the sole alibi'

347
00:44:11,418 --> 00:44:16,379
'How can I ever thank you for
many favors you have done'

348
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:21,352
'In unions of traded hearts,
you have been the sole alibi'

349
00:44:22,429 --> 00:44:27,390
'None like you who have blessed,
in all this world'

'None like you who have blessed,
in all this world'

'Who else carries news of the
lives and woes of lovers'

352
00:44:43,117 --> 00:44:47,452
"O'dove, my courier'

'Go, that she may know,
it's my missive'

362
00:45:57,858 --> 00:46:03,319
'And I shall meet her
after evening prayers,'

363
00:46:03,497 --> 00:46:05,329
'like you have come to me'

364

Qazi, you persecute
Waaris for nothing.

400
00:51:58,118 --> 00:52:02,021
Patience, he will make
our town famous

401
00:52:02,957 --> 00:52:04,891
He's leading the young
boys and girls astray

402
00:52:05,225 --> 00:52:08,490
He's singing, violating the king's
law and he is inciting the people

403
00:52:09,263 --> 00:52:11,254
I will have to complain
to the governor about him

404
00:52:11,999 --> 00:52:16,493
Qazi, forget the boys and girls.
You don't get carried away

405
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:18,499
A quack is a threat to life

406
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:20,539
A priest of infirm convictions
is a threat to the creed

407
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:28,273
Qazi Gyasuddin, if your accusations
are proven true,

408
00:52:29,049 --> 00:52:35,318
Waaris Shah maybe hanged.
- My Lord, just order his arrest

409
00:52:36,256 --> 00:52:38,281
He will confess

410
00:52:40,995 --> 00:52:43,930
Waaris is to be arrested
and presented before me

411
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:46,998
Forgive my trespasses, my Lord

412
00:52:47,601 --> 00:52:51,196
Choudhary, Malik, all the boys,
girls, they're all his fans

413
00:52:54,642 --> 00:52:56,167
A chance of rebellion

414
00:52:57,011 --> 00:52:59,070
The arrest may be made by night

415
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,232
Waaris Shah...?

416
00:53:28,876 --> 00:53:29,502
Yes ?

417
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:34,609
By the governor's orders, on charges
of blasphemy, you are arrested

418
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:39,543
Bring him along

419
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:07,907
Waaris Shah, what have you
to say in your defence ?

420
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:12,514
All accusations are false

421
00:54:14,221 --> 00:54:16,246
In the music of minstrels
one transcends to God,

422
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:19,187
a way to reach Him

423
00:54:20,894 --> 00:54:23,261
It brings one face to
face with the Divine

424
00:54:24,798 --> 00:54:29,395
The fiery manifestation of which was
witnessed by Moses upon Mount Sinai

425
00:54:31,338 --> 00:54:34,364
Music can show the same miracle.
The fire which burns no one,

426
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,201
only lights an ecstasy

427
00:54:38,712 --> 00:54:43,809
If you can't perform this miracle,
do you know what will befall you ?

428
00:54:45,319 --> 00:54:46,787
Forgive me, Lord

429
00:54:48,222 --> 00:54:52,591
What's to befall upon you and I were
decided the day when we were born

430
00:54:54,328 --> 00:54:56,626
The rest I leave to Allah

431
00:54:57,398 --> 00:55:01,301
Do not play with words. Just say,
can you perform the miracle ?

432
00:55:02,236 --> 00:55:05,206
A shrine to Baba Makhdoom
stands in Kasoor

433
00:55:06,807 --> 00:55:09,606
I shall perform the miracle
in the presence of my mentor

434
00:55:30,297 --> 00:55:38,297
'Allah-hu..

435
00:55:41,775 --> 00:55:46,110

Bravo Waaris Shah !

486
01:00:08,208 --> 01:00:10,700
You are truly Allah's devotee

487
01:00:12,613 --> 01:00:18,211

 have said my prayers,

 observed every ritual

488
01:00:20,354 --> 01:00:23,813
But the light which now
rises from within..

489
01:00:24,992 --> 01:00:27,222
I never felt before

490
01:00:28,128 --> 01:00:35,592
Waaris Shah, may your name and the
name of your Heer live forever

491
01:00:36,236 --> 01:00:37,931
So I pray

492
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:41,267
Come

493
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:45,343
Poet..

494
01:00:47,147 --> 01:00:48,205
Say..

495
01:00:49,717 --> 01:00:51,879
You will have Heer and Ranjha
unite, won't you ?

496
01:00:52,753 --> 01:01:00,753
The storyteller brings to life
the players in his tale..

497
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,530
And he becomes their minion and
what consequences they reach,

498
01:01:08,635 --> 01:01:10,626
are no more the
storyteller's dictate

499
01:01:13,073 --> 01:01:16,600
But circumstance, which they find
themselves in, will decide

500
01:01:20,047 --> 01:01:28,047
Then why do I feel as if I know so
intimately, your Heer and Ranjha ?

501
01:01:30,657 --> 01:01:37,620
Baba Makhdoom said, some experiences
are universal, some personal

502
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,223
Yours ?

503
01:01:41,268 --> 01:01:42,394
Personal

504
01:01:45,706 --> 01:01:47,470
You know Heer and Ranjha ?

505
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:56,241
As closely as I know
myself .. and you

506
01:01:58,752 --> 01:02:00,720
But you do not know the culmination,
neither yours nor mine

507
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:06,650
Baba Makhdoom knows

508
01:02:15,736 --> 01:02:23,736
'Seething in anger she charged,
arm upraised to strike'

509
01:02:28,015 --> 01:02:34,978
'that beauteous visage,
torments the man'

510
01:02:35,823 --> 01:02:41,227
'Ranjha wakes out of a dream,
What a wonder, my love'

511
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:53,299
'Heer rewards with a smile,”

512
01:02:55,909 --> 01:03:02,337
'It's her Ranjha, who carries
the flute, his earrings shine'

513
01:03:10,724 --> 01:03:17,187
'Behind the locks flowing
on her face, she blushes'

514
01:03:17,898 --> 01:03:23,029
'Between beauty and amour,
it was love at first sight'

515
01:03:27,741 --> 01:03:35,741
'Heer is overwhelmed, shy'

516
01:03:44,992 --> 01:03:47,359
Saabo, come to your senses.
Have you gone mad ?

517
01:03:48,162 --> 01:03:49,823
I'm crazen in your love

518
01:03:50,431 --> 01:03:51,762
This is no love, but lust

519
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:55,825
What you blame to be
lust is God's truth

520
01:03:56,904 --> 01:03:58,770
In the union of man and woman
creation is propagated

521
01:04:01,942 --> 01:04:06,311
Saabo, do not lay waste your youth.
Marry a man your parents choose

522
01:04:07,114 --> 01:04:08,843
And bear out God's truth

523
01:04:09,516 --> 01:04:14,920
Waaris, do not spurn me lest 

turn into a venomous serpent

524
01:04:16,023 --> 01:04:17,855
The charmer fears no snake

525
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:20,918
That, only time will tell

526
01:06:00,427 --> 01:06:02,759
Praise be to Allah, The Merciful
and most Benevolent

527
01:06:07,067 --> 01:06:08,535
Heer...?

528
01:06:46,106 --> 01:06:47,232
Father, lassi (lassi: yogurt drink)

529
01:06:48,042 --> 01:06:51,012
No, daughter. What a morning, 

haven't heard Waaris Shah's voice

530
01:06:51,178 --> 01:06:53,203
It's as if the Sun has not risen

531
01:06:54,048 --> 01:06:56,608
God bless, I hope he
is in good health

532
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:58,277
I'll find out...?

533
01:06:58,485 --> 01:07:00,510
No child, I shall go

534
01:07:01,055 --> 01:07:05,617
You keep up with your mother and
the chores, you'll marry soon

535
01:07:10,397 --> 01:07:13,332
This town is as cold as a graveyard
without Waaris Shah's voice

536
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:16,299
We'll soon be called
the Silent City.

537
01:07:16,403 --> 01:07:18,064
A breaking of hearts
makes no sound

538
01:07:19,073 --> 01:07:22,475
Can you guess what next is to
happen to Heer and Ranjha ?

539
01:07:23,143 --> 01:07:26,602
Don't ask me, go and ask Waaris.
- But today, he has been silent

540
01:07:26,714 --> 01:07:28,011
All day, he hasn't sung a verse

541
01:07:30,184 --> 01:07:37,056
Waaris, how can this be possible ?
We have taken you as one of our own

542
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,089
Flowers are known by their thorns

543
01:07:44,164 --> 01:07:47,134
My manuscript is gone,
my art is lost

544
01:07:49,269 --> 01:07:51,033
I wish, I died

545
01:07:52,106 --> 01:08:00,106
Your life is God's gift. Only He
gives, only He takes. By any creed..

546
01:08:01,615 --> 01:08:05,643
Suicide is sin,
to be punished in Hell

547
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:12,291
What worse a Hell can there
be, my Heer is gone

548
01:08:13,093 --> 01:08:16,085
God willing, you may still find it

549
01:08:17,131 --> 01:08:23,036
If the mint from which the coins
were stolen, still stands..

550
01:08:23,137 --> 01:08:24,263
Why grieve ?

551
01:08:29,176 --> 01:08:33,807
The kingdom of the heart lies ruined
- But what's come over Waaris ?

552
01:08:35,082 --> 01:08:42,921
Waaris knows, or God knows.
- His Heer manuscript is stolen

553
01:08:43,123 --> 01:08:46,889
So much of effort gone to waste,
the poor thing is morose

554
01:09:31,105 --> 01:09:38,068
If you want the manuscript of Heer,
come at midnight to the old castle

555
01:09:39,179 --> 01:09:45,414
Give me my desire, I'll
give you yours too

556
01:09:57,197 --> 01:10:01,759
'I'm set afire in
my passion for you'

557
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:08,203
'This fire I've lit only for you'

558
01:10:10,244 --> 01:10:15,307

01:10:27,828 --> 01:10:35,828
'Stoke the embers or douse my fire,

562
01:10:38,339 --> 01:10:43,334
'But only for you, my fires I lit'

563
01:10:44,912 --> 01:10:50,214
'But only for you, my fires I lit'

564
01:10:56,357 --> 01:11:01,887
"You are proud and vain
for your beauty'

565
01:11:04,865 --> 01:11:09,996
'Only girlish mischief and
conceit are upon your mind'

566
01:11:13,941 --> 01:11:18,936
'Lovers, fakirs, cobras, bees,..

567
01:11:22,383 --> 01:11:29,949

'My bed lies empty, for
you to ravage, my love'

571
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:10,295
'With your fires, quench
my fire, my love'

572
01:12:10,798 --> 01:12:14,325
<i>'My empty bed, for you to ravage,</i>

573
01:12:14,702 --> 01:12:18,605
'in your fires, come quench mine'

01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:24,301
'I'm now in full blossom,"

01:12:25,513 --> 01:12:30,349
'my fires lit only for you'

01:12:31,919 --> 01:12:36,356

'If you wish to ask me the truth,'

578
01:12:52,106 --> 01:12:58,045
'hearken to me now, lass'

beauty is pristine'

you tonight's fire'

'But I lit only for
you tonight's fire'

'Seize tonight's chance, my love,'

584
01:13:56,403 --> 01:14:03,503
'like the charmer who
entices the serpent'

585

who transgress'

01:14:54,094 --> 01:15:00,329
'Heed this, Waaris Shah warns,

592
01:15:03,103 --> 01:15:09,941
...and fear the wrath of God"

593
01:15:20,354 --> 01:15:21,378
Heer...?

594
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:24,781
Enough of niceties-courtesies,
Waaris

595
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:27,721
Now, we transact ?

596
01:15:27,862 --> 01:15:34,427
Saabo, love's portent is lost
when you begin transacting

597
01:15:36,103 --> 01:15:41,906
Look Waaris, you want the Heer
manuscript and I want you

598
01:15:44,478 --> 01:15:45,707
If I am not to have you,

599
01:15:46,747 --> 01:15:51,742
then the fires that consume
me will also destroy Heer

600
01:15:56,123 --> 01:15:57,488
Is that fair exchange ?

601
01:15:57,891 --> 01:16:02,453
Saabo, if you ask me to pick
between honor and heart..

602
01:16:03,697 --> 01:16:05,665
Then my answer is honor

603
01:16:08,469 --> 01:16:09,527
Very well then, Waaris

604
01:16:14,575 --> 01:16:15,770
I'll put to fire your heart

605
01:16:31,125 --> 01:16:34,527
Waaris, do not break our
hearts, do not leave

606
01:16:34,628 --> 01:16:35,959
Remember what you
swore to your Master

607
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:40,958
If you lose courage and leave this
town, then who will write Heer ?

608
01:16:41,669 --> 01:16:43,899
Do not leave, Waaris

609
01:17:18,639 --> 01:17:23,839
Poet, your Master's command, here
you must bring Heer to life

610
01:17:27,014 --> 01:17:28,140
Here lies the story so far

611
01:17:29,917 --> 01:17:31,885
Some you sent to me through
the Tattler dove ;

612
01:17:33,153 --> 01:17:36,555
the rest I heard in your own words,

 committed to memory

613
01:17:40,594 --> 01:17:42,824
Take.. your tale

614
01:17:44,865 --> 01:17:46,230
Anything else you wish ?

615
01:18:13,828 --> 01:18:16,126
AsSalamu Alaykum, Aunt.
- WaAlaykum AsSalaam, my boy

616
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,698
AsSalamu Alaykum, Ashraf Miyan.
- WaAlaykum AsSalaam, Inayat Miyan

617
01:18:28,709 --> 01:18:30,700
Chaudhary saheb, AsSalamu Alaykum.

618
01:18:31,345 --> 01:18:34,747
WaAlaykum AsSalaam.
- Inayat, welcome

619
01:18:34,915 --> 01:18:38,715
Where have you been ?
- Kabul, Balkh and Bukhara

620
01:18:39,353 --> 01:18:44,757
Will you be in town for a while ?
- He must be raring to leave

621
01:18:45,926 --> 01:18:47,792
What can I do, I'm footloose

622
01:18:48,362 --> 01:18:51,855
Then we'll hatch a plan
to tie you down

623
01:18:51,966 --> 01:18:56,062
Leave him be, let him go home.
His folks must be expecting him

624
01:18:56,237 --> 01:18:57,705
Yes, I'll be on my way.
- God be with you

625
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:12,811
Saabo, Abba, Ammi.. I'm home
{(Abba: Father ; Ammi: Mother)

626
01:19:15,189 --> 01:19:17,521
Good boy! Halt!

627
01:19:19,893 --> 01:19:21,054
Abba...!
- Inayat my boy..

628
01:19:21,395 --> 01:19:23,090
AsSalamu Alaykum, Abba.
- WaAlaykum AsSalaam

629
01:19:23,197 --> 01:19:24,221
Brother!

630
01:19:25,466 --> 01:19:26,991
Saabo, what news of you ?

631
01:19:27,234 --> 01:19:28,895
You're home, son ?
- AsSalamu Alaykum

632
01:19:29,003 --> 01:19:30,027
Live long, son

633
01:19:30,437 --> 01:19:33,771
I missed all of you.
- We were counting days, son

634
01:19:34,775 --> 01:19:36,937
How feeble my son looks.
- Not at all

635
01:19:37,878 --> 01:19:41,815
What have you brought for me ?
- Mother and sister, stop pestering

636
01:19:41,916 --> 01:19:44,783
Fetch him water to drink. Go.
-You take out what you have for me

637
01:19:44,952 --> 01:19:46,215
So many things, sister

638
01:19:46,921 --> 01:19:53,793
<i>'Every logic I shall accept,</i>

639
01:19:57,865 --> 01:20:05,033
'but no one can erase
this thing ever'

640
01:20:05,839 --> 01:20:12,905
<i>'Being in love is such a disease,</i>

641
01:20:14,448 --> 01:20:22,448
'heads may roll, but
love'll cease, never'

642
01:20:25,993 --> 01:20:28,963
This is for me ?
- It's for Bhagpari

643
01:20:30,831 --> 01:20:33,823
This is for me!
- It's also for Bhagpari

644
01:20:35,502 --> 01:20:40,872
Is this for me ?
- For Bhagpari, but you can keep it

645
01:20:43,978 --> 01:20:46,174
Everyone I find, has
Bhagpari on his mind

646
01:20:47,247 --> 01:20:50,114
Enough of running off
to Balkh and Bukhara

647
01:20:51,151 --> 01:20:55,247
Now stay at home, marry Bhagpari
and tend the farmland

648
01:20:56,457 --> 01:20:58,721
I'm going over to fix
the wedding date

649
01:21:02,530 --> 01:21:05,830
Bhagpari is yours, how long
can I keep her in my care

650
01:21:07,334 --> 01:21:09,325
Each year, you keep putting
off the wedding date

651
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:15,201
It's why I'm here. It's the only way

 can stop Inayat from running off

652
01:21:15,376 --> 01:21:18,175
It's time to get him
married to Bhagpari

653
01:21:21,048 --> 01:21:22,880
Every silken dress,

654
01:21:24,985 --> 01:21:29,013
the sight of jewelry in gold and
silver, always makes me wonder..

655
01:21:30,190 --> 01:21:32,352
How pretty my Bhagpari
will look in it ?

656
01:21:33,928 --> 01:21:41,928
'In testing times,
to sacrifice love'

657
01:21:43,437 --> 01:21:49,900
'In pining for a lost love,
is true love too'

658
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:55,947
'If truth be told,
now speak it true'

659
01:22:01,388 --> 01:22:09,261
'Now is the time
to belie falsehood'

660
01:22:13,167 --> 01:22:21,167
A lover drowned herself
in ariver.."

661
01:22:26,614 --> 01:22:33,987
'When love's pangs were
too much to bear'

662
01:22:34,588 --> 01:22:40,254
<i>'Q'Waaris Shah, if it
must be suicide.</i>

663
01:22:45,966 --> 01:22:53,966
'Then come, fall in love'

664
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:05,620
Who is Waaris Shah, how long has he
been having an affair with Bhagpari?

665
01:23:06,287 --> 01:23:08,654
It's none of the sort,
son. He's a poet

666
01:23:08,822 --> 01:23:10,620
He came to town to write poetry

667
01:23:11,292 --> 01:23:14,660
He has melody, boy and girls flock
to him to hear his verse

668
01:23:15,062 --> 01:23:18,657
Our Saabo goes too, yes Saabo ?
-Yes Abba

669
01:23:19,834 --> 01:23:20,858
Don't worry

670
01:23:21,102 --> 01:23:22,900
I'll visit Bhagpari's house,

671
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:25,061
to put a stop to it all

672
01:23:27,141 --> 01:23:29,769
But the dove ?
- There's a cure for it too

673
01:23:38,752 --> 01:23:41,813
Have no worries. Prepare
for the wedding

674
01:23:42,122 --> 01:23:44,648
Very good. God keep you.
- God keep you

675
01:24:04,745 --> 01:24:10,741
Whose messages does the dove bring ?
- Only verses of 'Heer' from Waaris

676
01:24:11,519 --> 01:24:13,988
Stop this exchange of
letters with strangers

677
01:24:15,322 --> 01:24:18,986
Waaris is no stranger to us.
- Don't talk rubbish

678
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:24,063
You are about to wed Inayat.
- My wedding ? Without my consent ?

679
01:24:24,231 --> 01:24:26,598
Never was a girl's consent asked,

680
01:24:27,334 --> 01:24:31,032
you take for a husband the
man of your parents' choice

681
01:24:32,072 --> 01:24:36,202
Consent is a man's right.
It's tradition, it's law

682
01:24:37,611 --> 01:24:41,980
Can I not be married to
Waaris ? I love him

683
01:24:42,083 --> 01:24:44,609
Silence !

684
01:24:46,153 --> 01:24:48,485
Never again bring
such words to mouth..

685
01:24:48,589 --> 01:24:50,387
...it'll be the ruination
of you and him

686
01:24:51,358 --> 01:24:54,350
Till the day you wed,
you'll stay indoors

687
01:25:25,226 --> 01:25:26,625
Bhagpari

688
01:25:31,132 --> 01:25:35,194
You are about to marry,
stop coming here

689
01:25:43,744 --> 01:25:45,143
Can all do as bidden ?

690
01:25:48,582 --> 01:25:50,175
If they wish, they can

691
01:25:52,753 --> 01:25:54,278
Can you speak a lie ?

692
01:25:57,391 --> 01:25:58,449
No

693
01:26:03,164 --> 01:26:04,632
Can you elope with me ?

694
01:26:06,266 --> 01:26:07,495
Bhagpari

695
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:14,398
You can't ?

696
01:26:24,818 --> 01:26:26,217
You can't, can you ?

697
01:26:29,890 --> 01:26:33,690
Then ask not of flower
not to be fragrant

698
01:26:34,929 --> 01:26:41,232
Beg not of thorns, not to prick.
I will do what's in my powers

699
01:26:43,304 --> 01:26:50,472
What is beyond me, I am bounden to

700
01:26:55,316 --> 01:27:03,316
'Heer, love's ecstasy
cannot be savored..'

701
01:27:07,394 --> 01:27:14,323
'if it's adulterated with
what's stolen or lustful'

702
01:27:15,336 --> 01:27:22,470
"O'Waaris Shah, the
goldsmith knows.."

703
01:27:31,318 --> 01:27:38,748
'How priceless gold is corrupted'

704
01:27:43,964 --> 01:27:47,491
Waaris, open your eyes.
It's me, Saabo

705
01:27:50,004 --> 01:27:53,531
Saabo, what have you left to burn ?

706
01:27:53,774 --> 01:27:54,798
Much

707
01:27:55,743 --> 01:28:00,340
The Tattler will tattle no more, nor
Bhagpari fetches you your bread

708
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:08,881
She is to wed.. my brother

709
01:28:14,996 --> 01:28:16,395
Now I shall be coming

710
01:28:19,633 --> 01:28:22,659
Have you more arrows
in your quiver?

711
01:28:23,570 --> 01:28:24,731
Yes

712
01:28:26,573 --> 01:28:28,337
Then poison my bread

713
01:28:29,643 --> 01:28:33,375
A dead Waaris, is what use to
me ? I want this Waaris, alive

714
01:28:37,117 --> 01:28:38,084
Supper

715
01:28:57,404 --> 01:29:05,404
'Fires of love, so hard to suffer'

716
01:29:10,484 --> 01:29:15,251
'Love, the greatest tutor, tempers
every other emotion'

717
01:29:16,790 --> 01:29:20,192
'Waaris Shah the fakir,
who renounces all else,

718
01:29:20,294 --> 01:29:22,922
...0'let his prayers bear fruit'

719
01:29:30,471 --> 01:29:38,242
'In culmination, let Heer's
love be requited'

720
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:57,890
Bhagpari, your fiance accuses that
you and Waaris are in love.

721
01:29:59,133 --> 01:30:00,601
Is it true ?

722
01:30:08,742 --> 01:30:09,766
True

723
01:30:15,816 --> 01:30:16,840
Waaris Shah

724
01:30:17,685 --> 01:30:19,119
What have you to say ?

725
01:30:19,787 --> 01:30:20,811
It is true

726
01:30:24,658 --> 01:30:27,559
So you both confess your crime ?

727
01:30:28,762 --> 01:30:29,854
What crime is done ?

728
01:30:31,599 --> 01:30:35,160
Love captivates the world of Creation
the earth and heavens, Qazi

729
01:30:35,803 --> 01:30:37,737
Love is the root,
the seed of creation

730
01:30:39,573 --> 01:30:41,007
Will you refute God's commandment ?

731
01:30:42,576 --> 01:30:46,570
It's unbecoming of the Wise, to speak
falsehoods while reciting scriptures

732
01:30:46,914 --> 01:30:48,177
Teach me not these philosophies

733
01:30:48,282 --> 01:30:50,512
If it's no physical relationship,
are the two of you willing..

734
01:30:50,618 --> 01:30:53,053
To face the test of chastity ?

735
01:30:53,787 --> 01:30:54,879
Yes

736
01:30:57,858 --> 01:31:00,589
You shall walk upon burning coals

737
01:31:04,431 --> 01:31:08,698
If a single blister is suffered,
you will be punished with death

738
01:31:36,163 --> 01:31:41,829
'When you have made pure your Soul,
then witness love's test'

739
01:31:45,205 --> 01:31:50,666
'When you have made pure your Soul,
then witness love's test'

740
01:31:51,512 --> 01:31:56,575
'When you have made pure your Soul,
then witness love's test'

741
01:31:57,184 --> 01:32:05,184
'In zealous sacrifice, set yourself
afire, then witness'

742
01:32:06,527 --> 01:32:11,863
'When you have made pure your Soul,
then witness love's test'

743
01:32:12,166 --> 01:32:18,037
'When you have made pure your Soul,
then witness love's test'

744
01:32:36,524 --> 01:32:41,860
'Witness in romances, this
culmination of love'

745
01:32:48,168 --> 01:32:53,572
'Witness in romances, this
culmination of love'

746
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:59,544
'One who is ruined, is given.
Once given, one is lost'

747
01:33:00,114 --> 01:33:02,549
'For once, in your beloved..*

748
01:33:03,584 --> 01:33:05,712
'For once, in your beloved..*

749
01:33:06,187 --> 01:33:08,849
'look in those eyes, then witness'

750
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:14,892
'When you have made pure your Soul,
then witness love's test'

751
01:33:15,563 --> 01:33:21,559
'When you have made pure your Soul,
then witness love's test'

752
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:44,615
'This love is fearless, why
should it care for anyone ?*

753
01:33:51,198 --> 01:33:56,602
'This love is fearless, why
should it care for anyone ?*

754
01:33:57,271 --> 01:34:02,732
'One who fears, is dead.
Once dead, one is undone'

755
01:34:03,310 --> 01:34:11,310
'Banish egos from your mind,
then be witness'

756
01:34:12,286 --> 01:34:17,588
'When you have made pure your Soul,
then witness love's test'

757
01:34:18,325 --> 01:34:23,559
'When you have made pure your Soul,
then witness love's test'

758
01:34:24,365 --> 01:34:32,364
'In zealous sacrifice, set yourself
afire, then witness'

759
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:38,606
'When you have made pure your Soul,
then witness love's test'

760
01:34:39,346 --> 01:34:45,342
'When you have made pure your Soul,
then witness love's test'

761
01:35:26,427 --> 01:35:30,386
The fire did not even touch them,
which means, they are innocent

762
01:35:35,503 --> 01:35:38,063
Both of them are exonerated

763
01:35:41,542 --> 01:35:45,445
Inayat is guilty of making
false accusations

764
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:50,308
And fined 50 gold coins. Which
you shall pay to Waaris

765
01:35:55,356 --> 01:36:00,658
Waaris, this miracle is proof,
that you are in love with Allah

766
01:36:01,529 --> 01:36:03,361
And Allah loves you

767
01:36:12,806 --> 01:36:16,743
Take, the price for your
victory and my loss

768
01:36:24,351 --> 01:36:28,345
Imam saheb, what use are
gold coins to me ?

769
01:36:31,058 --> 01:36:33,049
Use it for the mosque

770
01:36:34,829 --> 01:36:39,528
Imam saheb, I wish to speak
with Waaris in private

771
01:36:57,584 --> 01:36:59,018
Waaris Shah..

772
01:37:02,389 --> 01:37:05,188
What do you think..
you have won ?

773
01:37:07,061 --> 01:37:08,085
You are lost

774
01:37:12,399 --> 01:37:13,423
You have lost

775
01:37:15,936 --> 01:37:20,931
Your victory betrays your defeat,
my loss is my gain

776
01:37:23,244 --> 01:37:24,609
A beautiful death,

777
01:37:26,013 --> 01:37:29,881
that only one in a million lovers
are destined to court..

778
01:37:29,984 --> 01:37:34,945
Could have been yours, had you
only suffered the blisters

779
01:37:37,191 --> 01:37:42,129
Wretched you live, so
wretched you shall die

780
01:37:50,204 --> 01:37:51,933
Bhagpari was destined to be mine

781
01:37:53,641 --> 01:37:55,166
The vows were made long ago

782
01:37:57,278 --> 01:37:58,973
She will wed me

783
01:38:01,215 --> 01:38:02,614
Even the date is fixed

784
01:38:04,652 --> 01:38:06,120

 only came to invite you

785
01:38:09,256 --> 01:38:17,256
Inayat, if I tell you that you
do not hurt me, it'd be a lie

786
01:38:23,137 --> 01:38:24,434
I'm no angel

787
01:38:26,307 --> 01:38:27,468
I am human

788
01:38:30,678 --> 01:38:34,911
This day on, I shall not
remain the Waaris I was

789
01:38:38,753 --> 01:38:42,781
Maybe it's this day, that
my Master told me about..

790
01:38:44,692 --> 01:38:46,683
The pain will enrich my pen

791
01:38:50,965 --> 01:38:57,268
What is mine to seek ? To reap the
riches of pathos or Bhagpari ?

792
01:39:00,808 --> 01:39:02,799
Futile is the seeking of the path
when the guiding hand is no more

793
01:39:05,045 --> 01:39:07,742
But I'll take what God gives

794
01:39:08,315 --> 01:39:14,618
What you deserve is
not in God's hands,

795
01:39:14,722 --> 01:39:16,190
but in mine

796
01:39:18,125 --> 01:39:21,686
But, even I am no angel

797
01:39:34,642 --> 01:39:37,771
Waaris, what's come over you ?

798
01:39:40,748 --> 01:39:42,614
Why are you speaking
of renunciation ?

799
01:39:45,686 --> 01:39:50,021
At this time so many desires must
be blossoming in your heart

800
01:39:51,659 --> 01:39:55,653
Do not ask me what's happened

801
01:39:57,698 --> 01:40:01,635
In the drawing of each breath I feel
the incision of a double-edged sword

802
01:40:01,936 --> 01:40:03,131
I know

803
01:40:05,672 --> 01:40:10,803
In the emptinesses of your
heart a pathos has awakened

804
01:40:12,846 --> 01:40:17,283
Was it the riches of such a pathos
that Baba Makhdoom alluded to ?

805
01:40:20,788 --> 01:40:24,190
He had said, what I lack is passion

806
01:40:26,293 --> 01:40:32,494
Waaris, only on one condition, 

shall accept you as my disciple

807
01:40:35,636 --> 01:40:41,439
The riches of all pathos you reap,
you shall spend in writing Heer

808
01:40:43,377 --> 01:40:48,872
And until Heer is completed,
you shall live in Malkahans

809
01:40:51,852 --> 01:40:55,186
Bhagpari, daughter of
Ishfaqullah Chaudhary..

810
01:40:55,289 --> 01:41:03,289
Your wedding is to be solemnized
with Inayat, son of Rashid Malik

811
01:41:04,331 --> 01:41:05,799
Do you give consent ?

812
01:41:17,244 --> 01:41:22,774
I ask a second time, do you concede
to marriage with Inayat Malik ?

813
01:41:31,892 --> 01:41:36,090
For the last time, do you concede
to marriage with Inayat Malik ?

814
01:41:43,837 --> 01:41:45,931
Bhagpari.. Bhagpari...!
-Oh?

815
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:48,966
The bride has conceded

816
01:41:49,076 --> 01:41:54,742
Congratulations..
- Happy tidings

817
01:41:54,849 --> 01:41:57,147
Congratulations Chaudhary saheb

818

love can never blossom'

'Those inflicted by love's knives'

822
01:44:22,396 --> 01:44:26,958
Waaris Shah, Bhagpari is now
estranged to you. Now forget her

823
01:44:30,003 --> 01:44:35,305
She was always a stranger, only
my memories of her were mine,

824
01:44:37,111 --> 01:44:38,135
they still remain

825
01:44:42,616 --> 01:44:46,075
Let go of your memories,
in dreams of me

826
01:44:50,524 --> 01:44:54,483
And forget the one for whose
sake I have renounced all ?

827
01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:14,004
'Heer says, O'Ranjha woe betide'

828
01:45:15,349 --> 01:45:21,083

829
01:45:22,056 --> 01:45:28,052
'l have renounced all I had'

830
01:45:34,034 --> 01:45:42,034
'Yet you have no mercy for me ?*

831
01:45:45,713 --> 01:45:51,709
'Like the wailing bird
I cry all day, night'

832
01:45:59,060 --> 01:46:05,124
'l am struck by a dementia'

833
01:46:05,299 --> 01:46:12,330
"O'Waaris, have I no
sympathizer left'

834
01:46:19,113 --> 01:46:27,113
'O'whom am I to tell my woes ?*

835
01:46:33,728 --> 01:46:38,097
That's all for today.
Go home, everyone

836
01:46:56,350 --> 01:47:00,878
Saabo, you too. It's time
to start the kitchen fires

837
01:47:02,956 --> 01:47:06,984
You know when I cook, when I eat,
you know not of my heart ?

838
01:47:10,364 --> 01:47:11,422
That I know, too

839
01:47:13,868 --> 01:47:15,427
I have earned your ire

840
01:47:17,772 --> 01:47:21,675
Still you do not look upon
me, even as a foe ?

841
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:27,639
You are no foe of mine,

842
01:47:29,283 --> 01:47:32,583
no one is, not even Qazi

843
01:47:35,656 --> 01:47:43,656
I have heard, in one's heart,
there's place for only two,

844
01:47:45,733 --> 01:47:47,997
friend and foe

845
01:47:49,804 --> 01:47:53,536
Even in hatred is a kind of loving,
a sort of kinship, no ?

846
01:47:55,643 --> 01:47:57,202
Even this kinship of
hatred is not mine ?

847
01:48:00,247 --> 01:48:02,477
Stab a sword into water, but
water is not severed, Saabo

848
01:48:05,285 --> 01:48:12,851
Where do they go, who find
neither love nor hatred ?

849
01:48:14,762 --> 01:48:17,732
Estranged once, I am to remain
a stranger forever ?

850
01:48:19,299 --> 01:48:27,299
Ones who set their hearts, attain
God before sinners like me

851
01:48:31,612 --> 01:48:32,704
attain God before He calls us

852
01:48:33,847 --> 01:48:35,315
Easier said than done

853
01:49:18,559 --> 01:49:19,583
Where are you coming from ?

854
01:49:20,494 --> 01:49:21,518
Where I go every day

855
01:49:23,597 --> 01:49:24,621
To Waaris Shah ?

856
01:49:29,002 --> 01:49:30,401
Why ask when you know ?

857
01:49:32,773 --> 01:49:37,370
You and I are married. It's your
duty to obey your husband's command

858
01:49:40,514 --> 01:49:42,414
Never again, shall
you go to see him

859
01:49:44,418 --> 01:49:48,321
Except about Allah, His Prophet and
Waaris Shah, every command of yours,

860
01:49:48,422 --> 01:49:49,583
I shall obey

861
01:49:51,692 --> 01:49:53,490
You own me, body and life

862
01:49:56,030 --> 01:49:57,464
If you wish, you may have my life

863
01:50:02,302 --> 01:50:07,536
Your body, yes. But it's one
else who owns your heart

864
01:50:09,076 --> 01:50:13,206
Such is true, but who has
a hold on the heart ?

865
01:50:16,217 --> 01:50:18,242
Do you have a hold upon your heart?

866
01:50:21,689 --> 01:50:25,626
Your body is mine and your heart
is with someone else ?

867
01:50:27,294 --> 01:50:28,557
This sharing, I do not accept

868
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:35,735
At wish, you may divorce me

869
01:50:37,972 --> 01:50:42,432
I want to possess you, heart and
soul. And you want freedom from me?

870
01:50:44,879 --> 01:50:45,903
Remember this Bhagpari,

871
01:50:48,215 --> 01:50:49,649
if you won't give in
to me body and soul,

872
01:50:51,652 --> 01:50:53,586
then you will not belong
to anyone else

873
01:51:04,798 --> 01:51:06,926
Saabo, what happened to you ?

874
01:51:09,470 --> 01:51:13,373
Noora, my heart won't relent,
nor my heart's love

875
01:51:14,809 --> 01:51:19,406
It's as if my hunger, my thirst,
is there no more

876
01:51:20,781 --> 01:51:24,376
All the while I feel as if
a fire is consuming my body

877
01:51:25,719 --> 01:51:29,451
Strange malaise, you should
see the apothecary

878
01:51:33,427 --> 01:51:35,794
No doctor has any cure for
this disease that's love

879
01:51:36,397 --> 01:51:41,426
Waaris Shah surely has. He
knows love's every mystery

880
01:51:43,637 --> 01:51:48,632
You tell me to ask a cure of the
man who inflicted this ill ?

881
01:51:49,610 --> 01:51:51,772
Is that the story ?

882
01:51:53,047 --> 01:51:56,415
Then go to Baba Makhdoom's
shrine and pray

883
01:51:57,051 --> 01:51:58,450
Your purpose will be served

884
01:52:09,063 --> 01:52:11,725
O'Makhdoom Baba, Giver of
the wishes of many..

885
01:52:12,533 --> 01:52:15,025
Grant me my wish too

886
01:52:15,903 --> 01:52:20,272
If you won't grant me my wish, how
will I know how great you are

887
01:52:22,009 --> 01:52:23,170
Give to me Waaris

888
01:52:24,812 --> 01:52:27,474
Without Waaris, what
use is this life ?

889
01:52:29,050 --> 01:52:30,882
The sin of my death be upon you

890
01:52:32,286 --> 01:52:33,310
Give me Waaris

891
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:01,942
Saabo.. Saabo..

892
01:53:05,185 --> 01:53:06,846
Look, I have brought for you Henna,
the bride's wedding colors

893
01:53:07,788 --> 01:53:08,880
Makhdoom Baba sends it

894
01:53:10,958 --> 01:53:11,982
For me 7?

895
01:53:13,094 --> 01:53:16,325
What you have brought for me,
paint me with your own hands

896
01:53:31,412 --> 01:53:33,779
Recite for me, some
new verse from 'Heer'

897
01:53:34,315 --> 01:53:35,339
Saabo,

898
01:53:37,818 --> 01:53:39,843
after this day, Waaris
will never sing a verse

899
01:53:42,222 --> 01:53:43,781
You wished for me,

900
01:53:45,826 --> 01:53:48,124
I have come, to become yours

901
01:53:50,364 --> 01:53:53,061
But your share of me, will
only be a mortal form

902
01:53:56,170 --> 01:53:57,194
What do you mean ?

903
01:53:58,339 --> 01:54:03,004
My Master's dream will go unrealized
Heer will never be completed

904
01:54:05,446 --> 01:54:09,110
What.. I may have you,
but never completely ?

905
01:54:12,119 --> 01:54:16,386

 am to remain incomplete
...so also my Waaris ?

906
01:54:18,893 --> 01:54:26,893
No, not this Waaris I desired. Once
tied to me, his Heer is abandoned?

907
01:54:29,670 --> 01:54:33,106
Then what do I say
to Baba Makhdoom ?

908
01:54:37,278 --> 01:54:38,643
Say..

909
01:54:40,414 --> 01:54:42,007
Saabo has set you free

910
01:55:52,452 --> 01:55:54,819
Now you have more memories
to add to Heer

911
01:55:56,857 --> 01:55:59,292
The sacrifice of a million
Saabos your verses deserve

912
01:56:00,461 --> 01:56:04,261
But I was trying to catch
a shadow, what a fool I was

913
01:56:10,805 --> 01:56:15,299
Inayat, the thorn that pricks you,
is the same that's pricking me

914
01:56:16,544 --> 01:56:19,275
I have lost once. Chaudhary
and Malik are his fans

915
01:56:20,114 --> 01:56:22,208
Even the governor became his fan.

916
01:56:22,316 --> 01:56:24,614
And this son of mine
feeds himself fat

917
01:56:25,385 --> 01:56:28,446
No hopes that he might ever
lessen his father's burden

918
01:56:33,894 --> 01:56:37,296
Throwing him out of this
town is impossible

919
01:56:39,466 --> 01:56:41,366
But throwing him out of
the world is possible

920
01:56:42,903 --> 01:56:50,367
Can you go to that extent ?
- Anything, for the fires I burn in

921
01:56:55,516 --> 01:56:57,450
Qazi saheb, in your court..

922
01:56:57,551 --> 01:57:01,078
...we have been convicted and
punished several times

923
01:57:02,156 --> 01:57:03,851
Sinners that we are, what
makes you call upon us ?

924
01:57:05,559 --> 01:57:08,585
Turn of circumstance

925
01:57:09,964 --> 01:57:13,662
Speak openly please.
- Waaris Shah, you know him?

926
01:57:15,970 --> 01:57:19,065
Yes, a traveler I hear. He lives
in the mosque, writing Heer

927
01:57:20,274 --> 01:57:23,642
He has to be killed and
his body, disposed of

928
01:57:24,578 --> 01:57:27,604
This case won't come up for
hearing in your court ?

929
01:57:30,250 --> 01:57:31,581
In no court

930
01:57:58,579 --> 01:57:59,205
Quick

931
01:58:29,343 --> 01:58:30,674
It all went well ?

932
01:58:30,845 --> 01:58:33,610
Your bidding is done, Qazi saheb.
-No one saw ?

933
01:58:34,381 --> 01:58:40,320
You left behind no evidence ?
-We're old hands and you know it

934
01:58:49,530 --> 01:58:50,622
Bhagpari..

935
01:58:54,134 --> 01:58:56,967
The laddoo is your favorite,
is it not 2?2?

936
01:58:59,273 --> 01:59:01,970
What gives, you seem elated ?

937
01:59:02,609 --> 01:59:04,168
Yes.. listen..

938
01:59:06,013 --> 01:59:07,447
Do you see red in my hands ?

939
01:59:10,284 --> 01:59:11,376
No

940
01:59:12,086 --> 01:59:13,110
Never mind,

941
01:59:13,654 --> 01:59:16,988
tomorrow or day after, you'll
know the secret of my joys

942
01:59:17,325 --> 01:59:18,622
Eat a laddoo

943
01:59:54,462 --> 01:59:56,294
AsSalaamu Alaykum.
- WaAlaykum AsSalaam

944
01:59:56,964 --> 02:00:00,730
Malik saheb, no sound of Waaris ?
- Even I've been wondering..

945
02:00:00,935 --> 02:00:08,935
'All noble deeds are God's own'

946
02:00:15,349 --> 02:00:21,379
'l the doer, seek no credit'

947
02:00:23,023 --> 02:00:28,553
"Waaris Shah of Jandiala.."

948
02:00:34,535 --> 02:00:38,267
'Became a disciple.."

949
02:00:38,372 --> 02:00:44,334
'Of Makhdoom of Kasoor'

950
02:00:49,817 --> 02:00:51,808
AsSalaamu Alaykum.
- WaAlaykum AsSalaam

951
02:00:51,986 --> 02:00:57,823
Sirs, so early in the morning ?
You could have asked for me

952
02:00:58,492 --> 02:01:01,587
This morning we didn't hear any
verse from Heer, so we worried..

953
02:01:01,996 --> 02:01:04,658
And we thought, let's take a look,
is everything all right ?

954
02:01:06,600 --> 02:01:12,334
Last night, my Master visited me.
And how time flew, in his company

955
02:01:28,556 --> 02:01:31,890
Waaris.. Waaris..

956
02:01:36,564 --> 02:01:38,555
Master.. it's you !

957
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:43,764
How far has Heer progressed ?
- You know better

958
02:01:48,176 --> 02:01:51,043
Come out in the open, 

wish to speak with you

959
02:01:51,678 --> 02:01:52,770
Come

960
02:02:57,578 --> 02:03:05,578
'As one sows so shall he reap'

961
02:03:07,922 --> 02:03:15,090
'On judgment day, all
scores are settled'

962
02:03:16,530 --> 02:03:21,934
'For all gives and takes,
reward and retribution'

963
02:03:28,375 --> 02:03:36,375
'There, Justice is
handed out to you'

964
02:03:41,255 --> 02:03:44,953
'No one lives here forever'

965
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:52,866
'Only one who..

966
02:03:55,135 --> 02:04:03,135
...has lovingly renounced
will live forever'

967
02:04:04,044 --> 02:04:09,278
'You'll know it for yourselves...!

968
02:04:16,190 --> 02:04:24,190
'Come judgment day'

969
02:04:49,490 --> 02:04:50,514
Bhagpari..

970
02:04:55,362 --> 02:04:57,922
The completion of Heer
is a matter of joy

971
02:05:00,634 --> 02:05:02,898
Also a sorrow for separating
from a dear friend

972
02:05:07,608 --> 02:05:09,406
These are your memories and mine

973
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:15,178
My gift to you

974
02:05:18,419 --> 02:05:20,717
Poet, Heer belonged to and..

975
02:05:21,255 --> 02:05:29,255
.Will always belong to
Waaris Shah for all time

976
02:05:39,974 --> 02:05:45,606
Are those whom you leave behind ever
to hope of seeing you again ?

977
02:05:46,447 --> 02:05:50,543
Saabo, as if I'm astride
a willful horse,

978
02:05:51,785 --> 02:05:55,619
it's reins aren't in my hands, my
feet flailing, outside stirrups

979
02:05:59,059 --> 02:06:02,085
Not only mine, it's
the destiny of all ;

980
02:06:03,864 --> 02:06:08,097
taking us where we
are destined to be

981
02:06:13,741 --> 02:06:17,507
Whether it'll bring me back
here, I do not know

982
02:06:20,147 --> 02:06:24,106
All I know is, returning
isn't in my hands

983
02:06:29,256 --> 02:06:33,750
The monk's lot is to travel,
let others build cities

984
02:07:41,362 --> 02:07:42,386
What are you staring at ?

985
02:07:47,201 --> 02:07:48,293
Your smile

986
02:07:52,373 --> 02:07:53,932
Even that's not for me

987
02:07:57,945 --> 02:08:00,880
This aloofness, I cannot
bear anymore Bhagpari

988
02:08:04,618 --> 02:08:07,519
The fires that burn me
will be quenched..

989
02:08:07,955 --> 02:08:09,286
Only in my death

990
02:08:11,559 --> 02:08:12,958
Or yours

991
02:08:18,833 --> 02:08:19,857
Say,

992
02:08:25,105 --> 02:08:26,163
should I drink this poison ?

993
02:08:29,376 --> 02:08:30,468
Or you ?

994
02:08:44,625 --> 02:08:46,491
I am the root cause of
all this strife

995
02:08:50,364 --> 02:08:52,025
My death is desirable

996
02:09:21,762 --> 02:09:26,097
You won't let me live, you
won't even let me die ?

997
02:09:29,470 --> 02:09:32,701
Tell me, what do I do ?

998
02:09:37,078 --> 02:09:40,013
And what doldo ?

999
02:10:08,609 --> 02:10:10,338
No!

1000
02:11:15,176 --> 02:11:23,176
'Friends, to depart,
now comes my time'

1001
02:11:26,787 --> 02:11:30,382
“to depart, now comes my time'

1002
02:11:32,626 --> 02:11:40,626
'so deceive me not in false solace'

1003
02:11:44,037 --> 02:11:48,804
'so deceive me not in false solace'

1004
02:11:49,911 --> 02:11:57,911
'Friends, to depart,
now comes my time'

1005
02:12:24,512 --> 02:12:32,512
'For harsh words that
were mine perchance..'

1006
02:12:35,956 --> 02:12:40,484
'For harsh words that
were mine perchance..'

1007
02:12:41,795 --> 02:12:49,795
for God's sake, please
try to erase from minds'

1008
02:12:53,007 --> 02:12:57,501
for God's sake, please
try to erase from minds'

1009
02:12:59,080 --> 02:13:07,080
'Friends, to depart,
now comes my time'

1010
02:13:42,456 --> 02:13:50,456
'Whoever may happen to
despise my name.."

1011
02:13:53,634 --> 02:13:59,505
'Whoever may happen to
despise my name.."

1012
02:14:05,112 --> 02:14:13,112
'Renounce me now, if

 have been vile'

1013
02:14:16,490 --> 02:14:20,552
'renounce me now, if

 have been vile'

1014
02:14:22,896 --> 02:14:30,896
'Friends, to depart,
now comes my time'

1015
02:14:57,097 --> 02:15:05,097
'These graves and mosques
and shrines.."

1016
02:15:08,543 --> 02:15:13,037
'These graves and mosques
and shrines.."

1017
02:15:14,581 --> 02:15:22,581
'All bear witness of goings,
comings, play of time'

1018
02:15:25,559 --> 02:15:29,928
'all bear witness of goings,
comings, play of time'

1019
02:15:32,033 --> 02:15:40,033
'so deceive me not in false solace'

1020
02:15:43,243 --> 02:15:47,077
'so deceive me not in false solace'

1021
02:15:49,350 --> 02:15:57,350
'Friends, to depart,
now comes my time'

1022
02:16:02,263 --> 02:16:07,326
'to depart, now comes my time"
