1
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:43,401
- Where are you going?
- None of your business.

2
00:02:45,445 --> 00:02:48,414
All this while everything
you did was my business.

3
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:50,814
Now it's not?

4
00:02:54,454 --> 00:02:55,751
Anyway, tell me why you are going.

5
00:02:56,456 --> 00:02:57,923
What is wrong?

6
00:02:58,124 --> 00:02:59,751
Ask your heart before asking me.

7
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,226
l only know that after
your uncle's demise...

8
00:03:04,798 --> 00:03:07,266
We gave you every possible luxury.

9
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:10,269
- And fulfilled all your wishes.
- Oh yes, you did!

10
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:13,102
l wanted to study.
You made me give up college.

11
00:03:13,473 --> 00:03:16,442
Made me beg for every penny.
Meet this one, don't meet that..

12
00:03:16,743 --> 00:03:18,438
This is good and that is bad.
Taunted me all the time!

13
00:03:18,745 --> 00:03:21,111
ls this what you call
the luxury you gave me?

14
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:24,450
That's not my fault.
l followed your sister's orders.

15
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:28,946
Sure. You are a wax doll.
You can be moulded anyway.

16
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:33,118
- You do everything sister says.
- You're crossing limits.

17
00:03:34,494 --> 00:03:35,961
Create a new problem everyday!

18
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:40,466
- l'll have to complain to her.
- She too is dead for me!

19
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:45,861
She hasn't written to me once since
she went to Bombay 7 months ago.

20
00:03:46,506 --> 00:03:48,201
l don't want to see your faces!

21
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:13,488
lt's you? Come in.
lt's late night. These bags..?

22
00:04:14,534 --> 00:04:17,230
- Had another row?
- Yes.

23
00:04:17,537 --> 00:04:19,505
l've left that house.
Now l'll never go back.

24
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,840
You don't have to. l always
told you to come and stay here.

25
00:04:25,545 --> 00:04:28,514
You'll be away from him
and my time will pass.

26
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:31,517
- But you..
- l'd have come long ago.

27
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:34,520
But l was waiting to find a job.

28
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:38,015
- Job...?
- Yes, uncle. l've got a job.

29
00:04:38,558 --> 00:04:39,923
l begin work tomorrow.

30
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,528
Great! You're my true niece.

31
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:44,521
Who stands on her own.

32
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:52,266
Gentlemen, you have honoured me
by electing me Managing Director.

33
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:54,540
l thank you for the same.

34
00:04:55,909 --> 00:05:00,369
l hope you will help me in
culminating this job at the earliest.

35
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:03,040
We can offer you very little help.

36
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,051
And we have no knowledge
about the hotel industry.

37
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:07,951
Don't you worry.

38
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:16,961
l assure you our hotels will soon
be the talk of the entire nation.

39
00:05:17,597 --> 00:05:20,566
We mustn't delay
depositing the money.

40
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:23,398
lt's best to begin
work at the earliest.

41
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:26,564
My investment is nominal.
Take it anytime you wish.

42
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:31,304
Mr. Rai is the one who has to
arrange for the maximum capital.

43
00:05:31,611 --> 00:05:36,571
Don't worry. lt will be
arranged within the month.

44
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:39,251
All right, we'll take leave.

45
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,588
We'll meet later.

46
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:38,246
That's terrific. Mind blowing.

47
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,888
You haven't seen the
earlier dancer here.

48
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:44,655
She'd make you forget everything.

49
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:48,723
- These days where is she?
- She's on a break.

50
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:51,658
Permit us to leave. lt's late.

51
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:54,229
- So early?
- You're independent.

52
00:10:54,934 --> 00:10:58,392
Your wife is out of town. But
we have to face the home government.

53
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:02,237
- Okay.
- Good night.

54
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:15,318
Take a seat.

55
00:11:15,955 --> 00:11:19,413
- Yes?
- Regarding my case...

56
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:31,767
- The next date is December.
- Thank you.

57
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:39,604
- The fees..
- Don't worry about money.

58
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,280
Find some loophole to
defeat Tolaram Damdimal.

59
00:11:45,985 --> 00:11:49,614
Don't worry. Arrange for
the money and all will be done.

60
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:51,957
The money will reach court tomorrow.

61
00:11:52,992 --> 00:11:54,619
- Good day.
- Good day.

62
00:11:55,995 --> 00:11:57,462
- Don't forget.
- No.

63
00:11:57,997 --> 00:12:00,363
- He must be defeated.
- Yes, it will be done.

64
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:04,966
Your name?

65
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,639
Understood. Divorce case.

66
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:18,980
- Your husband's name?
- Pardon?

67
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,479
You've written it down.
Shy? Give that to me.

68
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:37,002
You're the new Secretary?
Follow me.

69
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,508
This is your seat.

70
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:47,842
- Have you worked before this?
- No.

71
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:50,515
l'll make you perfect in 2 days.

72
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:57,353
First arrange these letters
case wise in these files.

73
00:12:58,724 --> 00:13:02,683
This is...murder.
File 302.

74
00:13:05,064 --> 00:13:09,524
This case is of rioting.
Number 147.

75
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:13,698
This is cheating.

76
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:20,705
One man needed everywhere!

77
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:31,386
Does it hurt you to
address me by my full name?

78
00:13:32,091 --> 00:13:35,060
Do consider our old
friendship and my position.

79
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,567
Why did you call me?

80
00:13:45,104 --> 00:13:48,073
This is Court Session
and that is flat F 2.

81
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:50,075
A 40 year old bald man lives here.

82
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,077
Do l have to tweak
his son's hair?

83
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:54,075
Let me complete.

84
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:58,739
This man is blackmailing
the Parsi who just left.

85
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:03,077
l want you to go there and find
out where he goes, what he does.

86
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:05,081
- Get that? - Yes.
- Take this.

87
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:18,763
- Shall l go tomorrow?
- Don't be daft. Hurry.

88
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,437
And send the secretary in.

89
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:24,609
You're being called.

90
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:42,616
A problem everyday!
Follow this one or that.

91
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:45,896
Follow this lame or that blind.

92
00:14:46,165 --> 00:14:47,632
Go there in the night
and come here in the day.

93
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:51,136
what a pain! Now he wants
me to follow a bald man!

94
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:55,140
l'm fed up of this job.
Put me on duty elsewhere.

95
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:59,907
You're very impatient. Why don't
you think there's no place better...

96
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:03,148
...than this to find out
about the gang of smugglers.

97
00:15:04,183 --> 00:15:08,142
You can see the flat clearly
and Ajay is your childhood friend.

98
00:15:09,188 --> 00:15:10,883
So you have every liberty.

99
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,159
What liberty? l haven't
seen a movie for 3 months!

100
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:17,162
This lawyer is comparable
to Scotland Yard.

101
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:19,155
He's got the problems of the world!

102
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:20,760
And l'm the one who faces the music!

103
00:16:06,646 --> 00:16:08,876
Have you no shame
pulling down my sari?

104
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,946
l didn't pull it down.
lt was drawn to me.

105
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:17,552
She fell into my arms
the moment she saw me.

106
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:21,226
- Whose is it?
- Mine.

107
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:25,890
Yours? Will you punish it?

108
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:29,063
Not right to be generous to others.

109
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:34,569
Forgive me.
l scolded you by mistake.

110
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,237
- Do you always make such mistakes?
- Pardon?

111
00:16:37,943 --> 00:16:39,240
Sometimes.

112
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:43,248
You scolded me now. When will
you make the mistake of being nice?

113
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:45,243
- Pardon...
- Answer me.

114
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:49,250
What are you doing here?

115
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:52,590
l was being scolded and
she was making mistakes.

116
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:56,261
My dear, he's a gentleman.
Don't make a mistake with him.

117
00:16:59,298 --> 00:17:02,927
This is Bani, my niece and
he is Ajay, an advocate.

118
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:04,701
A famous lawyer of the city.

119
00:17:06,305 --> 00:17:09,604
- Glad to meet you.
- What are you doing?

120
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:12,937
- Nothing.
- Let's play some chess.

121
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:15,780
- Sure.
- Come along.

122
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:22,287
l'm glad we met.
The evening will pass.

123
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:24,280
Bani can't play chess!

124
00:17:25,324 --> 00:17:26,882
lt requires brains.

125
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:34,095
Otherwise she's very bright.
She's private secretary to a lawyer.

126
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,698
ls that so?

127
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:38,030
My sympathies to the lawyer.

128
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,705
Here you are.

129
00:17:43,342 --> 00:17:46,311
So that's your game.
Want to win the game?

130
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:51,305
No question. l've lost
in the very first move.

131
00:17:55,354 --> 00:17:57,322
This is a very dangerous game.

132
00:17:58,357 --> 00:18:00,985
One move decides the entire game.

133
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:05,986
Yes. Save yourself.
You are being checked.

134
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:10,062
l see that.

135
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,997
Make your move.

136
00:18:15,374 --> 00:18:16,739
Here you are.

137
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:17,412
Your good name?

138
00:22:17,616 --> 00:22:19,049
My name is...

139
00:22:25,624 --> 00:22:28,593
- What is your case?
- What can l say?

140
00:22:29,628 --> 00:22:32,096
My landlord gave me
notice to leave the house.

141
00:22:33,632 --> 00:22:35,429
- He can't sleep.
- Why?

142
00:22:35,634 --> 00:22:37,932
- His heart gets a jolt.
- You give it?

143
00:22:39,638 --> 00:22:41,606
l only dance.

144
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:44,336
- You dance?
- Yes.

145
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:46,110
l'll give you a demonstration.

146
00:22:54,653 --> 00:22:57,622
- That's quite enough.
- Did you like it?

147
00:22:58,057 --> 00:23:00,116
l'm feeling great.

148
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,627
But my landlord doesn't like it.

149
00:23:03,162 --> 00:23:05,630
- l'll talk to him. You may leave.
- Really?

150
00:23:06,065 --> 00:23:07,623
- Should l leave?
- Yes, go.

151
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,297
- Good day sir.
- Goodbye.

152
00:23:13,172 --> 00:23:15,970
What about your case?
ls this the time to come?

153
00:23:17,676 --> 00:23:21,510
ls this the time to come to
office? lt's 2 minutes past 10.30.

154
00:23:23,682 --> 00:23:25,309
The court doesn't believe in sorry.

155
00:23:25,684 --> 00:23:29,643
lf you are late, the work won't
be done and he'll be hanged!

156
00:23:30,022 --> 00:23:31,319
And who will save him
if he is hanged?

157
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,055
You or your apology?

158
00:23:34,693 --> 00:23:37,321
Forget the apology.
We have lots of work.

159
00:23:38,697 --> 00:23:40,665
Have you bought all your papers?

160
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,093
Given it up.

161
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:22,104
l can see everything.

162
00:24:22,741 --> 00:24:25,301
l thought you can only
see girls through this.

163
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:27,712
- Can't see men.
- What do you mean?

164
00:24:28,747 --> 00:24:31,716
The secretary is very nice.

165
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:35,386
The first day she captured
the office, the next,the heart.

166
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:37,453
Don't bore me.

167
00:24:38,157 --> 00:24:42,218
My getting bored is fine but
it shouldn't reach a stage...

168
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:44,456
..that you get bored of clients.

169
00:24:54,773 --> 00:24:58,402
Here's your mail and
this is your personal letter.

170
00:25:03,782 --> 00:25:05,147
lt's inside.

171
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:25,425
Enclosed is your fees; Rs. 200.
lt's not right to come to your office.

172
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:29,372
Hence be kind enough to meet me
in Hotel Majestic this evening.

173
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:31,503
l'll be wearing a white sari.

174
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:02,534
Did you write this letter to me?

175
00:26:02,841 --> 00:26:06,208
l am Mrs. Kapoor. And you..?

176
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:09,139
l'm Ajay Kumar and this is
Bani Choudhary, my Secretary.

177
00:26:12,184 --> 00:26:14,152
- Would you like something?
- No thanks.

178
00:26:15,854 --> 00:26:18,652
- You wrote..
- l troubled you because...

179
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:22,156
For the past three years,
my husband's property...

180
00:26:23,862 --> 00:26:27,320
You have some anger.
That day you didn't let me speak.

181
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:30,334
Has the temper cooled down?

182
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:32,564
Trunk call from Delhi.

183
00:26:33,872 --> 00:26:36,238
Stay here, l'll get back.
Don't go away.

184
00:26:54,893 --> 00:26:59,353
- How are you?
- Very well but dying to meet you.

185
00:26:59,898 --> 00:27:04,665
l want to come back. lt's
so hot here that l can't live.

186
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:07,599
l was thinking of leaving
by the morning train.

187
00:27:09,308 --> 00:27:14,211
l have to come to Delhi for
business in a day or two.

188
00:27:15,914 --> 00:27:17,882
Can't you stay there
for a couple of days?

189
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:20,475
We could return together.

190
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:22,887
The journey will be fun.

191
00:27:23,588 --> 00:27:25,613
l'll stay back if you say so.

192
00:27:26,258 --> 00:27:29,625
But l hope l won't
be waiting in vain.

193
00:27:29,928 --> 00:27:31,657
And make some excuse like always.

194
00:27:33,332 --> 00:27:36,893
Such impatience!
No, darling l will come.

195
00:27:37,436 --> 00:27:39,563
Then l'll wait for you.

196
00:27:47,946 --> 00:27:50,574
Don't worry. l've heard the case.

197
00:27:50,949 --> 00:27:53,247
- l'll start investigation tomorrow
- Thank you. Good bye.

198
00:27:54,953 --> 00:27:57,922
What are you doing here?

199
00:27:58,623 --> 00:28:00,250
l'm always here.
Where are you?

200
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:04,659
Right here but have no spare time.

201
00:28:07,966 --> 00:28:09,331
l see that.

202
00:28:15,974 --> 00:28:18,704
- Did you make this?
- Yes. Like it?

203
00:28:19,978 --> 00:28:21,275
Keep it.

204
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:25,279
My studio is two feet
away from your office.

205
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,947
Come over sometime.

206
00:28:29,988 --> 00:28:31,455
He's a good man.

207
00:28:32,391 --> 00:28:33,949
- He's quite a fool.
- Sure.

208
00:28:34,993 --> 00:28:36,426
Since when do you know him?

209
00:28:37,496 --> 00:28:39,464
He's your friend...
how will l know?

210
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:42,364
But he has made a nice case.

211
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:45,469
- l'm not talking about you.
- Who else?

212
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:48,297
That man who kept
talking to you for hours.

213
00:28:48,673 --> 00:28:49,970
Him...he...

214
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,810
- That was Ram Mohan.
- Know him for long?

215
00:28:57,015 --> 00:28:58,312
Yes, from childhood.

216
00:29:01,353 --> 00:29:02,786
Very handsome man.

217
00:29:03,522 --> 00:29:05,490
Of course. He's a businessman.

218
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:08,652
Why didn't you answer him?

219
00:29:10,028 --> 00:29:11,996
- l'm not talking to him.
- Why?

220
00:29:14,366 --> 00:29:17,335
That's between us.
Why should you ask?

221
00:29:25,043 --> 00:29:26,408
Why are you quiet?

222
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:29,513
Why should you ask?

223
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:35,589
l came to wish you good night.

224
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:52,674
You've come!

225
00:33:54,312 --> 00:33:56,007
What's the matter? Come in.

226
00:33:56,715 --> 00:33:59,275
This is my friend, Khanna.
He was on the same flight.

227
00:33:59,818 --> 00:34:03,948
- This is my wife, Maya.
- Hello. Please come in.

228
00:34:04,322 --> 00:34:06,790
Excuse me. l must keep
my bags in my room.

229
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:11,625
- Are you staying in this hotel?
- Yes. Room 302.

230
00:34:13,331 --> 00:34:15,629
Why don't you have lunch with us?
What do you say, darling?

231
00:34:19,337 --> 00:34:21,134
- How is Bani?
- She's fine.

232
00:34:21,339 --> 00:34:24,308
She's very bad. She hasn't
answered a single letter of mine.

233
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:28,107
You know how careless she is.
She must have forgotten.

234
00:34:28,747 --> 00:34:31,307
Let me see her. Then l'll show her.

235
00:34:33,017 --> 00:34:34,314
When do we leave?

236
00:34:34,686 --> 00:34:37,985
l have some work here.
Then l'll book the seats.

237
00:34:38,356 --> 00:34:41,325
- What work do you have here?
- l need money for business.

238
00:34:44,362 --> 00:34:46,330
You won't give me a
penny from your inheritance.

239
00:34:47,031 --> 00:34:48,999
And l have to beg from others.

240
00:34:49,768 --> 00:34:54,102
You're saying strange things. Dad's
money is meant for something specific.

241
00:34:54,372 --> 00:34:55,839
Then how can l give it?

242
00:34:57,375 --> 00:35:01,106
All right have it your way.
Anyway l've made arrangements.

243
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:05,679
lt's 10 o'clock.
That man must be waiting for me.

244
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:08,343
l must leave.
l'll be back by lunch.

245
00:35:08,787 --> 00:35:11,017
- Grab a bite.
- lt's an important appointment.

246
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,087
l'll be back by lunch.

247
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:16,690
Listen, book our tickets.

248
00:35:23,401 --> 00:35:26,859
- How are you?
- Ayah, go out.

249
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:36,042
Maya is going to Bombay.
You must accompany her.

250
00:35:38,683 --> 00:35:39,980
Here's your ticket.

251
00:35:41,419 --> 00:35:43,387
Your seats are in
the same compartment.

252
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:50,054
Take care to keep
the child with Maya.

253
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:53,727
She loves kids because
she can't have them.

254
00:35:53,932 --> 00:35:55,399
- But...
- No buts, darling.

255
00:35:56,835 --> 00:36:01,397
The moment the train reaches Dadar,
leave the child and disembark.

256
00:36:02,106 --> 00:36:04,074
And... be careful.

257
00:36:10,114 --> 00:36:11,411
l don't know why l'm scared.

258
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:15,419
For no reason, a life...

259
00:36:18,456 --> 00:36:21,425
This is life. One must
use one's head not heart.

260
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,429
After some days, your
son will own millions.

261
00:36:26,464 --> 00:36:29,433
And you...you will be mine.

262
00:36:34,472 --> 00:36:36,269
You invited me and came late.

263
00:36:36,808 --> 00:36:38,435
Forgive me for the delay.

264
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:40,842
Please.

265
00:36:45,483 --> 00:36:48,111
- Booked the seats?
- No darling.

266
00:36:49,487 --> 00:36:51,455
l have to go to Calcutta.

267
00:36:52,824 --> 00:36:55,122
The man l had to meet
has gone to Calcutta.

268
00:36:55,493 --> 00:36:56,858
Why must you go there?

269
00:36:57,495 --> 00:37:01,864
l have important work. l must
meet him or my work will suffer.

270
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,865
Must l rot here?

271
00:37:05,503 --> 00:37:09,462
l'll book your ticket.
Why don't you return alone?

272
00:37:10,174 --> 00:37:13,143
By the time your train reaches
Bombay, l'll be there by air.

273
00:37:14,512 --> 00:37:16,810
Why don't you put her
on the train tomorrow?

274
00:37:18,516 --> 00:37:21,974
- l can do that.
- l think that's a good arrangement.

275
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,886
- What do you say?
- As you wish.

276
00:37:25,523 --> 00:37:28,754
Don't pull a long face now.
l'll be in Bombay with you.

277
00:37:31,863 --> 00:37:33,490
What are you checking?

278
00:37:34,532 --> 00:37:36,762
Taking a look at what
you've hidden in this purse.

279
00:37:38,536 --> 00:37:40,504
You won't find anything
that belongs to your office.

280
00:37:40,939 --> 00:37:42,497
lf l find something
from my house...?

281
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:45,509
What do you have in
your house worth stealing?

282
00:37:46,044 --> 00:37:48,842
Half of it is broken
the rest covered in dust.

283
00:37:49,547 --> 00:37:54,007
You are right. There's nothing
in my house. lt is desolate.

284
00:37:54,552 --> 00:37:56,520
And l live in it, lost...

285
00:37:56,888 --> 00:37:58,515
How did you fall sick?

286
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:02,358
- Thanks to you.
- How come?

287
00:38:02,961 --> 00:38:06,522
- Walking with you.
- Then don't.

288
00:41:23,761 --> 00:41:28,221
- Going to ask for permission?
- Who are they to give permission?

289
00:41:29,433 --> 00:41:31,060
- Then why are you going?
- l have some work.

290
00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:33,737
- What?
- Tell you later.

291
00:41:43,781 --> 00:41:45,749
This is a map of platform 5.

292
00:41:46,784 --> 00:41:50,743
According to you, Maya's
compartment is the third.

293
00:41:51,189 --> 00:41:52,747
l'll bring her there
under some pretext.

294
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:56,089
We will stand here.

295
00:41:56,794 --> 00:41:58,489
There is a bench just here.

296
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,757
You stand on this bench.

297
00:42:01,799 --> 00:42:04,768
lt will be easy for you.
But keep one thing in mind.

298
00:42:06,804 --> 00:42:09,773
The moment the train halts and
your job is done, you must jump off.

299
00:42:10,308 --> 00:42:14,608
A taxi will be waiting for
you. lt's number is 5500

300
00:42:14,812 --> 00:42:16,575
- 5500. Get it?
- Yes.

301
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,185
Here's your money.

302
00:42:25,823 --> 00:42:29,384
Take this. You mustn't miss.

303
00:42:30,828 --> 00:42:32,295
Khanna never misses.

304
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:54,818
Madam is coming with
the child tonight.

305
00:42:55,253 --> 00:42:57,221
Take the car and bring her.

306
00:42:59,857 --> 00:43:01,484
Since nobody is home, in the
meantime, l'll arrange everything.

307
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:03,827
But sir, Bani has come home.

308
00:43:04,195 --> 00:43:05,822
- What?
- She's sitting inside.

309
00:43:20,878 --> 00:43:22,243
Are you well?

310
00:43:24,882 --> 00:43:27,851
Hmmm. l'm glad you've
gotten over the anger.

311
00:43:29,887 --> 00:43:31,354
Where's your luggage?

312
00:43:31,889 --> 00:43:35,848
l've come for the money uncle
willed to me, not to stay here.

313
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:43,530
You're so smart.
Found your own groom.

314
00:43:44,902 --> 00:43:47,871
- Tell me about him.
- lt's none of your concern!

315
00:43:49,907 --> 00:43:53,866
l only want to know the name of the
young man who captured this lioness.

316
00:43:54,312 --> 00:43:56,872
l haven't come to crack jokes.
l want my money.

317
00:43:57,248 --> 00:44:01,878
Whose joking? You know only
your sister can give the money.

318
00:44:02,586 --> 00:44:04,884
She's coming by the
midnight train. Meet her.

319
00:44:07,325 --> 00:44:09,555
- Where are you going?
- To the station to meet her.

320
00:44:09,927 --> 00:44:11,292
l too am going there.

321
00:44:41,959 --> 00:44:43,324
Twenty five minutes to go.

322
00:44:44,962 --> 00:44:46,930
What movie is playing here?

323
00:48:21,178 --> 00:48:23,146
Good gracious! He's dead!

324
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:25,144
What a terrible accident!

325
00:48:34,191 --> 00:48:36,887
The law is not with you.

326
00:48:38,195 --> 00:48:40,163
Tell us truthfully,
who your partner is.

327
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,567
l have no partner.
l don't know anybody!

328
00:48:49,206 --> 00:48:52,903
- How much did you pay him?
- l didn't pay anyone! l've nobody.

329
00:48:57,881 --> 00:49:00,509
How many times must l say,
l didn't kill my sister?

330
00:49:05,222 --> 00:49:07,190
Why don't you call Mr. Ajay?

331
00:49:08,225 --> 00:49:10,193
Constable, take her away.

332
00:49:44,662 --> 00:49:47,563
Don't bore me! ls this
some time to wake me up?

333
00:49:49,266 --> 00:49:51,234
Do you know Miss Bani Choudhary?

334
00:49:54,004 --> 00:49:56,063
Yes. She's my secretary.

335
00:49:56,273 --> 00:49:57,638
She's been arrested for murder.

336
00:49:59,276 --> 00:50:01,574
- Whose murder?
- Her sister's.

337
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,268
l didn't kill anyone.

338
00:50:26,704 --> 00:50:29,605
l'd gone to the station
with my brother-in-law.

339
00:50:31,308 --> 00:50:34,004
l don't know how the
pistol landed in my purse.

340
00:50:34,645 --> 00:50:36,272
lt went off.

341
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,287
l didn't commit the murder.

342
00:50:45,322 --> 00:50:46,880
l didn't kill!

343
00:50:47,991 --> 00:50:49,288
l'll look after everything.

344
00:50:52,329 --> 00:50:53,956
But tell me the truth.

345
00:50:57,334 --> 00:51:01,293
- What? Don't you believe me?
- My believing won't help.

346
00:51:01,939 --> 00:51:04,305
Till you are proven innocent.

347
00:51:06,343 --> 00:51:08,903
Now tell me where you got the pistol.

348
00:51:09,346 --> 00:51:11,814
l don't know!

349
00:51:14,351 --> 00:51:16,979
Where did you go after leaving me?

350
00:51:18,355 --> 00:51:22,314
Straight to brother-in-law's house
Then on to get my sister.

351
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,329
Sister? You never
told me she was coming.

352
00:51:26,864 --> 00:51:29,594
l didn't know. Her husband told me.

353
00:51:30,367 --> 00:51:33,336
- Whom else did you meet?
- Nobody.

354
00:51:38,709 --> 00:51:40,074
Nobody?

355
00:51:46,383 --> 00:51:50,342
Don't worry. l'll free you.

356
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:58,122
But l still can't believe
Bani is capable of murder.

357
00:51:58,729 --> 00:52:00,356
Only because she's
your friend's beloved?

358
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:03,096
No. l know her quite well.

359
00:52:03,801 --> 00:52:07,362
- She's a simple girl.
- That's a personal opinion.

360
00:52:08,405 --> 00:52:12,774
But if she's really committed
a murder, do you know your duty?

361
00:52:13,143 --> 00:52:14,371
Yes, l do.

362
00:52:43,841 --> 00:52:47,004
The bullet found in Mrs. Rai
Mohan's body was NOT fired from this.

363
00:52:59,456 --> 00:53:03,187
- Drive slowly.
- Why?

364
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,018
Something will happen.

365
00:53:05,462 --> 00:53:09,091
This guy had the
same disease as you.

366
00:53:10,868 --> 00:53:15,430
l mean he wanted to go home in
a hurry but went to God's abode.

367
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:26,045
lf he wanted to die with Rs. 5500,
he could've willed it to me.

368
00:53:27,484 --> 00:53:30,112
The cash that went to a government
bank would have come to em.

369
00:53:31,488 --> 00:53:33,456
Right. The man resembles me.

370
00:53:34,491 --> 00:53:37,289
- You resemble a monkey.
- Grapes?

371
00:53:38,495 --> 00:53:40,463
- Monkey!
- l thought grape.

372
00:53:42,499 --> 00:53:43,864
Monkey.

373
00:53:45,836 --> 00:53:50,967
But yet my wife and l loved Bani.

374
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:54,977
l don't understand.

375
00:54:00,517 --> 00:54:02,144
Why did Bani do this crazy thing?

376
00:54:06,924 --> 00:54:09,484
Who was it who fired
the second bullet?

377
00:54:12,529 --> 00:54:13,894
Second bullet?

378
00:54:14,865 --> 00:54:16,162
What are you saying?

379
00:54:16,867 --> 00:54:18,994
Yes, your wife was shot twice.

380
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:22,168
Only one shot was fired
from Bani's pistol.

381
00:54:25,542 --> 00:54:28,340
- But who could that be?
- That's what we want to know.

382
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:34,517
But if there was another person...

383
00:54:39,556 --> 00:54:41,183
Somebody at the station
would have seen him.

384
00:54:41,558 --> 00:54:43,025
No.

385
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,529
Do you only suspect Bani?

386
00:54:48,565 --> 00:54:52,695
As long as Bani lived with us
l never saw her meet anyone...

387
00:54:54,571 --> 00:54:59,531
But after leaving us,
obviously l don't know.

388
00:55:00,577 --> 00:55:05,537
You'd mentioned earlier that
Bani was quite quarrelsome.

389
00:55:09,586 --> 00:55:11,554
Did your wife and
Bani ever have a fight?

390
00:55:12,589 --> 00:55:14,955
Small arguments take place
in every family.

391
00:55:16,593 --> 00:55:19,562
But no major fights.

392
00:55:20,263 --> 00:55:21,560
As far as l know.

393
00:55:25,602 --> 00:55:27,365
Did Bani ever come
here after she left?

394
00:55:29,606 --> 00:55:31,039
Just once.

395
00:55:32,609 --> 00:55:35,578
That too the night
she shot her sister.

396
00:55:36,113 --> 00:55:37,580
Why had she come?

397
00:55:39,616 --> 00:55:41,049
She knows best.

398
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,588
But she told me
she'd come for money.

399
00:55:46,023 --> 00:55:47,581
..which her uncle willed to her.

400
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:51,389
Will...May l see it?

401
00:55:52,629 --> 00:55:55,598
Sure. l'll get it.

402
00:56:07,644 --> 00:56:09,111
Here you are.

403
00:56:15,652 --> 00:56:18,951
This is the will which
hides the secret of the murder.

404
00:56:19,656 --> 00:56:21,021
lt clearly says...

405
00:56:21,658 --> 00:56:25,219
My only daughter Maya is
the sole heir to my property.

406
00:56:25,662 --> 00:56:28,096
And her children after her demise.

407
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:32,363
But if Maya dies childless...

408
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:36,298
My niece Bani inherits everything.

409
00:56:37,674 --> 00:56:42,134
Now l shall prove that Bani
murdered Maya for the property.

410
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:46,638
When she shot at Maya,
she had no clue...

411
00:56:48,685 --> 00:56:50,915
The true heir to the
property had been born!

412
00:56:56,359 --> 00:56:58,156
How many bullets hit Maya?

413
00:56:58,695 --> 00:57:01,493
Two. One in the chest and
the other grazed her ear.

414
00:57:02,365 --> 00:57:04,333
How many shots were
fired at the time of murder?

415
00:57:04,701 --> 00:57:06,103
Only two.

416
00:57:06,103 --> 00:57:07,661
Did you see both being fired?

417
00:57:08,105 --> 00:57:11,006
No. l only heard the first.

418
00:57:11,441 --> 00:57:15,502
When l turned around, l saw
the accused firing the second.

419
00:57:16,713 --> 00:57:19,181
lsn't it possible that
she fired the first shot too?

420
00:57:20,717 --> 00:57:24,676
When l confiscated her pistol,
l found only one shot had been fired.

421
00:57:26,723 --> 00:57:28,691
Another person fired the
second shot from another gun.

422
00:57:29,126 --> 00:57:30,423
- Right?
- Yes.

423
00:57:31,394 --> 00:57:33,419
How long after the first
shot was the second fired?

424
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:36,699
Barely a second.
ln fact even less.

425
00:57:38,735 --> 00:57:44,196
Was the hand of the accused
raised when the shot was fired?

426
00:57:44,741 --> 00:57:46,106
Yes.

427
00:57:46,743 --> 00:57:49,041
- Are you the ballistic expert?
- Yes.

428
00:57:49,746 --> 00:57:53,705
The bullet found in the
body of the deceased, Maya..

429
00:57:54,751 --> 00:57:58,380
...was not fired from the pistol
in the hands of the accused?

430
00:57:58,755 --> 00:58:00,120
- Right?
- Yes.

431
00:58:00,757 --> 00:58:03,385
What pistol was in the hands of
the accused at the time of murder?

432
00:58:07,764 --> 00:58:10,733
From what gun was the bullet found
in the body of the deceased fired?

433
00:58:12,769 --> 00:58:15,397
Do you easily find such
pistols in this country?

434
00:58:16,773 --> 00:58:19,333
No. The license is generally
not given to the common man.

435
00:58:21,178 --> 00:58:26,411
Two killers fired at Maya
from 2 different pistols.

436
00:58:27,284 --> 00:58:31,584
Both the pistols were of the
same kind and were fired together.

437
00:58:31,788 --> 00:58:33,585
And at the same victim.

438
00:58:34,191 --> 00:58:38,753
Doesn't this prove that
it was a joint conspiracy?

439
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,165
You may leave.

440
00:58:46,203 --> 00:58:50,105
Now l will prove who is the
real beneficiary of this murder.

441
00:58:50,807 --> 00:58:53,275
The accused, Bani
or the other killer.

442
00:58:54,211 --> 00:58:57,612
And l begin with such
a strange witness...

443
00:58:58,815 --> 00:59:00,783
Who probably knew about the murder..

444
00:59:01,318 --> 00:59:04,583
...even before the real
murderer thought about it.

445
00:59:05,822 --> 00:59:08,120
l think this bald man
will nail Bani.

446
00:59:10,827 --> 00:59:13,387
Refer to me as Muthu Swamy.

447
00:59:15,832 --> 00:59:18,801
- Are you an astrologer?
- My entire family was.

448
00:59:19,836 --> 00:59:23,795
Meaning you predict the
destiny of all generations.

449
00:59:24,174 --> 00:59:26,142
What does that mean?

450
00:59:26,843 --> 00:59:29,641
What is this new bill?

451
00:59:33,583 --> 00:59:36,814
l wish to know if
you predict the future?

452
00:59:37,254 --> 00:59:38,812
After being paid Rs. 501 .

453
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:46,322
After accepting Rs. 501 , you'd
written something about Maya's future

454
00:59:46,863 --> 00:59:49,832
Something? lt's so important.
l'll personally read it out.

455
00:59:50,867 --> 00:59:57,602
28 March. ln a month, Maya will
suffer a tragic train or road mishap.

456
00:59:58,208 --> 01:00:00,176
But she will escape. lt's definite.

457
01:00:00,877 --> 01:00:03,437
- What else is written?
- lt also says...

458
01:00:04,881 --> 01:00:09,682
For a year from that date
she will be at grave risk...

459
01:00:10,153 --> 01:00:12,849
..to life at the hands of a dear one.

460
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:18,853
lf she escapes, she will
die after bearing 5 kids.

461
01:00:19,562 --> 01:00:22,360
Today if she were safe,
couldn't she have 5 kids?

462
01:00:22,899 --> 01:00:24,264
lt says so here.

463
01:00:26,903 --> 01:00:29,701
Did Prof. Swamy's first
prediction come true?

464
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:35,473
Yes. A month later we barely
escaped in a car accident.

465
01:00:35,912 --> 01:00:42,215
According to the second prediction
Maya would lose her life to a near one

466
01:00:42,919 --> 01:00:46,377
Did she have any other family
members apart from Bani?

467
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:51,287
No. We didn't doubt poor Bani.

468
01:00:51,928 --> 01:00:55,489
But we were worried that she
shouldn't innocently do something.

469
01:00:56,933 --> 01:00:59,902
So l sent my wife out of
the city for the period.

470
01:01:00,937 --> 01:01:04,896
Then why did you get her
back before the year was up?

471
01:01:05,942 --> 01:01:08,410
The period would have
ended at midnight.

472
01:01:10,947 --> 01:01:12,915
And her train was
to arrive at midnight.

473
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:17,249
l didn't imagine anything
would happen in a few seconds.

474
01:01:17,954 --> 01:01:22,914
You had a child when your
wife was away in Delhi.

475
01:01:24,361 --> 01:01:26,591
Did Bani know about this?

476
01:01:27,964 --> 01:01:33,925
We'd decided not to tell anyone
till the period got over.

477
01:01:35,972 --> 01:01:39,840
At the time of murder, the accused
Bani didn't know Maya had a child.

478
01:01:40,377 --> 01:01:44,336
She only knew that in the
absence of a child, after Maya...

479
01:01:45,982 --> 01:01:47,950
She would inherit the property.

480
01:01:50,987 --> 01:01:53,285
Does the defense want
to interrogate the witness?

481
01:01:59,996 --> 01:02:01,463
Did you love your wife?

482
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,365
- Yes.
- How much?

483
01:02:06,002 --> 01:02:07,367
A lot.

484
01:02:11,007 --> 01:02:14,568
lf you loved her so much,
why didn't you hate her sister?

485
01:02:17,013 --> 01:02:18,378
What do you want to say?

486
01:02:19,015 --> 01:02:21,711
l want to say that
you are lying to the court.

487
01:02:22,685 --> 01:02:23,982
You are a con man.

488
01:02:25,021 --> 01:02:30,982
lf Bani killed your wife,
why do you pretend to love her?

489
01:02:33,363 --> 01:02:34,990
My love is not artificial.

490
01:02:37,033 --> 01:02:39,001
l am sorry for her innocence.

491
01:02:40,036 --> 01:02:41,503
There are some people in this world..

492
01:02:42,038 --> 01:02:46,998
...who present their right cheek
when slapped on the left cheek.

493
01:02:48,044 --> 01:02:51,013
l'll give you such a slap
that both jaws will ache!

494
01:02:55,051 --> 01:02:57,349
How many days before your
wife's death was the child born?

495
01:02:58,054 --> 01:02:59,521
About a month.

496
01:03:02,058 --> 01:03:06,358
lf Bani had known you had
a child would she have killed?

497
01:03:08,064 --> 01:03:11,363
- Maybe not.
- Then why did you keep this from her?

498
01:03:12,402 --> 01:03:14,370
l kept nothing from her.

499
01:03:16,072 --> 01:03:17,869
Bani herself stopped meeting me.

500
01:03:18,408 --> 01:03:20,035
l never had the opportunity
to tell her anything.

501
01:03:22,078 --> 01:03:25,047
Bani herself came to you
a few hours before the murder.

502
01:03:26,082 --> 01:03:29,882
Yes and Maya was to come
with the child in a few hours.

503
01:03:31,087 --> 01:03:34,716
Would Bani have enjoyed hearing
the news or seeing the child?

504
01:03:35,425 --> 01:03:36,722
What do you think?

505
01:03:38,094 --> 01:03:40,062
- Have you ever had a pistol?
- No.

506
01:03:40,497 --> 01:03:42,055
- Since when is Bani with you?
- From her childhood.

507
01:03:43,099 --> 01:03:46,557
When she was with you, how many
hours a day would she be home?

508
01:03:47,103 --> 01:03:48,400
- About 1 7-18 hours.
- The rest of the time?

509
01:03:49,105 --> 01:03:51,801
- ln school.
- Did the school teach gun shooting?

510
01:03:53,109 --> 01:03:57,068
According to you, when the
station was crowded with people..

511
01:03:58,114 --> 01:03:59,672
She shot between them.

512
01:04:00,116 --> 01:04:03,085
She shot at the woman who
was inside the stopping train.

513
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:05,087
- Right?
- Yes.

514
01:04:06,122 --> 01:04:07,919
A woman who shoots
under these circumstances..

515
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:11,753
She's either a great
marksman or crazy.

516
01:04:13,129 --> 01:04:14,494
Do you think Bani is mad?

517
01:04:16,132 --> 01:04:18,828
No. Only a good marksman.

518
01:04:19,536 --> 01:04:24,769
Where did she learn to shoot
if not at your house or school?

519
01:04:26,543 --> 01:04:28,101
The question is not in order.

520
01:04:28,545 --> 01:04:33,949
l don't think so. Only a good
marksman can commit this crime.

521
01:04:34,417 --> 01:04:36,112
- None other.
- That will be proved.

522
01:04:36,553 --> 01:04:39,454
The question is only about where
the accused learnt to shoot.

523
01:04:40,657 --> 01:04:43,524
For many months she has worked
as secretary to the defense.

524
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:49,621
Whatever... l request the court
to give us time to gather evidence.

525
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:53,135
You are given 15 days.

526
01:04:57,173 --> 01:05:02,975
The question is why was she
killed at a crowded station?

527
01:05:03,446 --> 01:05:04,640
She wasn't allowed to reach home.

528
01:05:08,184 --> 01:05:12,644
Possibly the murderer didn't want
Mrs. Rai to meet or talk to anyone.

529
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:16,753
Meaning Mrs. Rai knew some secret..

530
01:05:17,193 --> 01:05:18,660
...that might risk the killer.

531
01:05:20,863 --> 01:05:22,160
Absolutely!

532
01:05:27,203 --> 01:05:30,832
That is why she was killed at
the station before getting home.

533
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:35,166
Then why wasn't she killed in Delhi?

534
01:05:38,214 --> 01:05:40,944
Suppose this murder
took place in Delhi..

535
01:05:41,217 --> 01:05:42,980
Our secretary wouldn't be caught.

536
01:05:43,553 --> 01:05:45,180
And we would be spared.

537
01:05:47,557 --> 01:05:51,015
So the murder happened
in Bombay to frame Bani.

538
01:05:53,963 --> 01:05:56,864
But what is it that
caused her to be killed?

539
01:05:57,634 --> 01:06:00,865
Mrs. Rai and the killer know it.

540
01:06:02,238 --> 01:06:04,866
Mrs. Rai can't talk
because she is dead.

541
01:06:05,241 --> 01:06:06,970
And the killer doesn't want to die.

542
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:14,882
l think something happened
in Delhi that caused the murder.

543
01:06:15,251 --> 01:06:16,548
The child was born in Delhi.

544
01:06:17,253 --> 01:06:19,221
- Child..
- Yes, Mrs. Rai's.

545
01:06:26,262 --> 01:06:28,230
For the first time,
you said something clever.

546
01:06:28,665 --> 01:06:30,633
l'm always brilliant but
you understood it only now.

547
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:47,647
Beyond your brains.

548
01:07:55,017 --> 01:07:56,314
Payment..?

549
01:07:58,020 --> 01:07:59,317
Good client.

550
01:08:28,384 --> 01:08:29,749
How are you?

551
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:35,948
Please come in.

552
01:08:38,394 --> 01:08:39,793
How far has the case progressed?

553
01:08:41,063 --> 01:08:43,361
The case is getting
confusing by the day.

554
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,960
But Ajay said there's
no cause to worry.

555
01:08:47,403 --> 01:08:50,964
Everything is fine but
we can't find the killer.

556
01:08:52,408 --> 01:08:54,376
But what has the killer
got to do with my case?

557
01:08:56,412 --> 01:08:57,777
Your case..?

558
01:08:59,415 --> 01:09:00,848
That's on the 8th.

559
01:09:02,752 --> 01:09:04,117
Where is your ayah?

560
01:09:05,421 --> 01:09:06,888
So that is your killer.

561
01:09:07,423 --> 01:09:11,052
Not the killer but a
step towards the killer.

562
01:09:11,427 --> 01:09:13,054
l want to ask her some questions.

563
01:09:15,431 --> 01:09:17,058
lt would be kind of you to call her.

564
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:26,408
Ask her not to tell anyone.

565
01:09:28,845 --> 01:09:34,408
This man is a good friend of mine.
Whatever he says, don't tell anyone.

566
01:09:38,454 --> 01:09:40,922
Who is the girl who came
with you to the milk center?

567
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:43,420
She's Marina, my childhood friend.

568
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:46,087
Childhood friend...?

569
01:09:48,865 --> 01:09:50,423
Who else has played with her?

570
01:09:51,467 --> 01:09:53,958
Don't you recall?
Try and remember...

571
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:55,937
Or my Rosie will be in trouble.

572
01:10:31,507 --> 01:10:35,466
Where have l gone?
l've come for my Marina.

573
01:10:36,512 --> 01:10:38,480
- To meet Marina?
- Yes. - But that's me.

574
01:10:40,516 --> 01:10:44,475
You are Marina!
When did you grow up?

575
01:10:44,921 --> 01:10:46,479
ls this your child?

576
01:10:47,523 --> 01:10:50,287
No, it's my master's.
He just left in the car.

577
01:10:51,527 --> 01:10:53,495
And the woman with him is his sister?

578
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:56,498
Sweetheart not sister.

579
01:10:56,933 --> 01:10:58,264
But who are you to ask?

580
01:11:00,536 --> 01:11:02,163
You don't recognise John D'Silva?

581
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:07,008
How you've grown!

582
01:11:07,944 --> 01:11:10,276
- Yes.
- Where's the mole on your nose?

583
01:11:11,547 --> 01:11:15,176
Yesterday l rubbed my nose
thrice and today l found you.

584
01:11:16,552 --> 01:11:18,019
Rub your nose a little more.

585
01:15:38,214 --> 01:15:41,183
- Ajay here.
- Found anything?

586
01:15:41,317 --> 01:15:44,775
Not a thing. Everything
is as Rai testified.

587
01:15:45,221 --> 01:15:49,282
l even went to the delivery home.
l'm now at the hotel she lived in.

588
01:15:50,226 --> 01:15:51,784
But there's nothing suspicious here.

589
01:15:52,328 --> 01:15:55,525
- Did you find anything?
- Just a letter.

590
01:15:55,831 --> 01:15:59,130
Addressed to Mrs. Rai
redirected from Grand Hotel.

591
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:02,569
Read out the address.

592
01:16:03,839 --> 01:16:05,807
Room 301 .

593
01:16:23,859 --> 01:16:27,317
Was a woman called Mrs. Rai
staying here a few days ago?

594
01:16:35,871 --> 01:16:39,500
Yes, she lived here for 7 months
and left on the 27th of March.

595
01:16:40,476 --> 01:16:43,843
- Did she have a child?
- Child? No.

596
01:16:45,881 --> 01:16:48,850
Can you tell me what kind
of people came to meet her?

597
01:16:49,885 --> 01:16:52,683
l think she lived alone.

598
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:56,858
Were you on duty in 301 last month?

599
01:16:57,226 --> 01:17:00,855
- Yes sir.
- Who came to meet Mrs. Rai?

600
01:17:01,897 --> 01:17:07,358
Nobody. Oh 2 days before she left
the hotel, 2 men came to see her.

601
01:17:07,903 --> 01:17:11,339
One left that very day and the
other man was in the room across.

602
01:17:11,907 --> 01:17:15,604
They ate together and
finally left together.

603
01:17:15,911 --> 01:17:17,344
What was his name?

604
01:17:19,915 --> 01:17:23,214
- Can you describe him?
- Can't forget his face.

605
01:17:23,919 --> 01:17:27,878
A swarthy face with bushy
eye brows and piercing eyes.

606
01:17:28,424 --> 01:17:33,885
Thin lips, a moustache and
a wound on his left eye.

607
01:17:39,601 --> 01:17:40,898
You are called to the office.

608
01:17:59,955 --> 01:18:01,422
Bani, come here.

609
01:18:09,965 --> 01:18:14,425
l feel l will suffocate
within these walls.

610
01:18:15,971 --> 01:18:19,270
- You never came to see me.
- l'm running around day and night.

611
01:18:20,976 --> 01:18:23,444
Don't lose heart.
Everything will be fine.

612
01:18:25,981 --> 01:18:30,441
Today l've come to see you.
Soon l'll come to take you away.

613
01:18:31,987 --> 01:18:33,784
- When?
- Very soon.

614
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:38,949
Was your sister pregnant
before she left for Delhi?

615
01:18:40,396 --> 01:18:42,296
She never mentioned it.

616
01:18:45,667 --> 01:18:47,692
Do you have a relative called Khanna?

617
01:18:50,005 --> 01:18:53,702
- No.
- Your sister or her husband's friend?

618
01:18:56,011 --> 01:18:58,445
- l don't think.
- Try to recall.

619
01:18:59,014 --> 01:19:01,642
He has a deep wound
mark on his left eye.

620
01:19:02,017 --> 01:19:06,477
Wound scar? l never
saw any such man.

621
01:19:07,022 --> 01:19:08,990
- At the station?
- Not even there.

622
01:19:10,025 --> 01:19:11,993
How is that related to the case?

623
01:19:18,367 --> 01:19:22,667
See you.

624
01:19:31,046 --> 01:19:33,606
Come in. How did you come by today?

625
01:19:41,056 --> 01:19:42,353
What else is news?

626
01:19:43,058 --> 01:19:47,017
Can a man's picture be
made without seeing him?

627
01:19:48,464 --> 01:19:51,763
l mean just by asking his features.

628
01:19:52,067 --> 01:19:54,035
Sure. l've made one.

629
01:19:55,737 --> 01:19:57,864
- You..?
- Yes. Would you like to see it?

630
01:19:58,073 --> 01:19:59,768
- Yes. Where is it?
- Come with me.

631
01:20:01,076 --> 01:20:06,036
The girl is my friend's beloved.
l made this by asking her features.

632
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:12,042
- What does your friend say?
- He feels it resembles the girl.

633
01:20:13,589 --> 01:20:16,456
- Why are you asking?
- l want to get one made.

634
01:20:17,092 --> 01:20:18,457
- Whose?
- Mr. Khanna.

635
01:20:19,094 --> 01:20:22,530
- Who is he?
- He stayed in Grand hotel.

636
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,900
There's a bearer called
Ahmed over there.

637
01:20:28,103 --> 01:20:29,661
He remembers Khanna well.

638
01:20:30,772 --> 01:20:32,069
Here is the address.

639
01:20:34,443 --> 01:20:35,876
Go to Delhi today itself.

640
01:20:53,128 --> 01:20:55,096
- Who is that lady?
- Meenadevi.

641
01:20:56,632 --> 01:20:58,099
She's our famous dancer.

642
01:20:58,534 --> 01:21:00,695
Famous dancer and l have no clue.

643
01:21:02,137 --> 01:21:03,900
Come over in the evening.
There's a grand program.

644
01:21:04,873 --> 01:21:08,434
- ls that so?
- Yes, she's dancing after 7 months.

645
01:21:10,145 --> 01:21:12,841
- She made others dance then?
- No, she was on leave.

646
01:21:27,162 --> 01:21:28,595
Ajay isn't here.

647
01:21:30,165 --> 01:21:33,464
You're back? You're funny.
Why did you put down the phone?

648
01:21:33,835 --> 01:21:35,132
My head is still stewing!

649
01:21:36,838 --> 01:21:38,135
l myself am upset.

650
01:21:40,175 --> 01:21:42,973
There were 2 Mrs. Rais in Delhi.

651
01:21:43,512 --> 01:21:48,142
Two? There's another one
wanting to become Mrs. Rai.

652
01:21:48,584 --> 01:21:51,018
- Stop fooling.
- l'm not fooling.

653
01:21:51,587 --> 01:21:54,147
l've seen her myself.
She goes to his house everyday.

654
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:56,657
Who is she?

655
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:01,488
- Who is she?
- Mr. Rai's hotel dancer.

656
01:22:02,864 --> 01:22:04,695
- Since when is she here?
- 6-7 days.

657
01:22:06,201 --> 01:22:09,568
- Where was she before this?
- On leave for 6-7 months.

658
01:26:26,461 --> 01:26:29,430
- But why do you want to
kidnap the child? - Simple.

659
01:26:29,865 --> 01:26:31,924
There were 2 Mrs. Rais in Delhi.

660
01:26:32,467 --> 01:26:34,935
Only one can be the real mother.

661
01:26:35,470 --> 01:26:39,031
lf she's alive, we'll know
the moment the child vanishes.

662
01:26:39,474 --> 01:26:40,771
Because a mother is a mother.

663
01:26:40,976 --> 01:26:42,944
But where will you keep the infant?

664
01:26:43,478 --> 01:26:46,845
- That's my responsibility.
- Fine but be careful.

665
01:26:47,482 --> 01:26:48,881
Don't you worry.

666
01:27:47,042 --> 01:27:52,173
- Why have you come so late?
- To arrest you.

667
01:27:52,547 --> 01:27:54,014
Show me your hand.

668
01:27:55,216 --> 01:27:57,844
- Am l a thief?
- A great one.

669
01:27:58,153 --> 01:28:00,519
- What have l stolen?
- My heart.

670
01:28:02,557 --> 01:28:05,117
Why would l steal it?
You must have lost it.

671
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:08,859
Give your statement in court
but l will arrest you.

672
01:28:09,564 --> 01:28:13,523
- How?
- Tell you...Like...this.

673
01:28:14,569 --> 01:28:19,529
- What is this?
- A handcuff that arrests 2 hearts.

674
01:29:04,619 --> 01:29:07,087
You're so naughty.
l thought the baby was crying.

675
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:18,258
- l must leave.
- So early?

676
01:29:18,633 --> 01:29:20,066
l have to arrange for the wedding.

677
01:29:21,636 --> 01:29:24,070
- ln the night?
- Never delay a good deed.

678
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:27,608
- When will we meet?
- Tomorrow at the same time.

679
01:30:09,684 --> 01:30:11,481
Have you seen the baby?

680
01:30:11,953 --> 01:30:13,648
- lsn't' he in the room?
- No. He's nowhere.

681
01:30:41,716 --> 01:30:43,684
l'm calling from the house.
Please call the master.

682
01:30:47,722 --> 01:30:50,088
- Call from the house.
- House..?

683
01:31:10,745 --> 01:31:12,212
Sir, l'm Marina.

684
01:31:13,748 --> 01:31:15,181
Yes?

685
01:31:16,751 --> 01:31:18,719
Why are you stuttering?
What's the matter?

686
01:31:20,088 --> 01:31:22,113
- The baby is lost.
- What??

687
01:31:22,757 --> 01:31:25,123
- The baby is lost.
- Where the hell were you?

688
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:47,145
Liked the dance?

689
01:31:49,117 --> 01:31:50,744
Why are you silent?

690
01:31:51,786 --> 01:31:53,754
- Come with me.
- Where?

691
01:31:54,789 --> 01:31:56,757
l'll tell you on the way.

692
01:32:51,512 --> 01:32:53,480
Please come in, sir.

693
01:32:53,848 --> 01:32:56,646
That day you ran away.
Today l won't let you escape.

694
01:32:57,852 --> 01:33:00,150
l didn't come here to go.

695
01:33:00,855 --> 01:33:02,220
Really? Sit down.

696
01:33:12,867 --> 01:33:14,835
- Hope you're not hurt.
- No.

697
01:33:15,870 --> 01:33:17,838
- Has your father agreed?
- To what?

698
01:33:19,207 --> 01:33:20,834
Our marriage.

699
01:33:21,276 --> 01:33:23,608
That day you ran away
without giving me an answer.

700
01:33:24,212 --> 01:33:25,509
Today l won't let you go.

701
01:33:26,881 --> 01:33:28,849
Do l lack anything?

702
01:33:29,884 --> 01:33:31,852
No. Not at all.

703
01:33:32,553 --> 01:33:34,851
Sharp eyes, curly hair.

704
01:33:35,890 --> 01:33:38,256
Juicy lips, fair skin.

705
01:33:38,893 --> 01:33:42,294
A flexible body.
The delicacy of roses.

706
01:33:43,298 --> 01:33:45,198
The intoxication of wine.

707
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:49,859
One who drinks will never
ever gain consciousness.

708
01:33:51,306 --> 01:33:54,867
and the best part is
you dance so well...

709
01:33:55,910 --> 01:33:57,878
That the god of dance
would be embarrassed.

710
01:34:00,915 --> 01:34:02,883
As pretty as your name.

711
01:34:03,918 --> 01:34:06,216
l'd love to marry you.

712
01:34:06,921 --> 01:34:10,379
But l can't because l'm married.

713
01:34:11,926 --> 01:34:13,894
- You're married?
- Yes.

714
01:34:19,934 --> 01:34:22,402
- Why are you crying?
- She's no more.

715
01:34:22,670 --> 01:34:24,570
- Who?
- Wife.

716
01:34:29,944 --> 01:34:32,310
- Then...
- No, darling.

717
01:34:33,281 --> 01:34:35,909
l can't ruin the life
of an innocent girl.

718
01:34:37,618 --> 01:34:40,246
You are unmarried
and l have a child.

719
01:34:40,455 --> 01:34:41,752
Doesn't matter.

720
01:34:44,959 --> 01:34:46,392
You are great.

721
01:34:50,965 --> 01:34:53,934
My dear son, you are fortunate.

722
01:34:54,969 --> 01:34:59,599
You found yourself a mother
and a wife for your father.

723
01:35:00,308 --> 01:35:02,606
Keep him carefully.
l have just one child.

724
01:35:04,312 --> 01:35:05,609
Okay, see you.

725
01:35:07,982 --> 01:35:12,282
You may go. The child is
with me. So you will return.

726
01:35:12,653 --> 01:35:15,952
- Sure.
- Say bye to Papa.

727
01:35:47,021 --> 01:35:48,989
- How did the child vanish?
- Don't know.

728
01:35:49,424 --> 01:35:51,415
What do you mean?
Where were you?

729
01:35:52,427 --> 01:35:54,452
l'd just come down.

730
01:35:55,029 --> 01:35:56,997
You wretch! Why did you
leave the child and go?

731
01:35:58,032 --> 01:36:00,000
l came to get milk for the baby.

732
01:36:17,051 --> 01:36:19,611
- Did anyone come home?
- No sir.

733
01:36:20,054 --> 01:36:24,354
Has a ghost taken him? How did he
vanish with both of you around?

734
01:36:28,062 --> 01:36:30,860
- l don't know.
- Shut up!

735
01:36:32,567 --> 01:36:35,365
Honestly tell me
who had come here.

736
01:36:35,803 --> 01:36:39,034
- l'll give you what you want.
- l didn't see anyone come in.

737
01:36:41,742 --> 01:36:47,374
Now hear this. lf anyone finds out
the baby is missing, l'll kill you.

738
01:36:58,493 --> 01:37:00,552
- Whom are you calling?
- The police.

739
01:37:01,095 --> 01:37:02,528
Be wise.

740
01:37:03,097 --> 01:37:06,726
You maybe the child's mom but
for the world l'm the father.

741
01:37:07,602 --> 01:37:09,069
And the mother was Maya.

742
01:37:11,873 --> 01:37:15,070
Doesn't matter.
Let me call the police!

743
01:37:16,511 --> 01:37:22,074
Don't be silly. We'll both be
hanged if the cops find the truth.

744
01:37:23,451 --> 01:37:24,816
You want your way.

745
01:37:29,123 --> 01:37:30,750
But if my baby is harmed..!

746
01:37:32,793 --> 01:37:36,593
l care more for him than you.
l did all this only for him.

747
01:37:37,131 --> 01:37:40,589
Then what's wrong now?
Why don't you inform the police?

748
01:37:41,135 --> 01:37:42,762
Try to understand me.

749
01:37:43,137 --> 01:37:44,434
l don't want to hear anything

750
01:37:46,641 --> 01:37:48,609
l'm shocked why you don't understand?

751
01:37:50,144 --> 01:37:53,944
lf we are complain to the cops,
the kidnappers will realise...

752
01:37:54,148 --> 01:37:55,775
And his life could be at risk.

753
01:37:57,151 --> 01:38:00,450
Then..will my baby never be found?

754
01:38:02,156 --> 01:38:04,784
- My baby!!
- Be brave.

755
01:38:07,161 --> 01:38:10,619
Be careful. Somebody
surely doubts us.

756
01:38:12,166 --> 01:38:14,896
Don't let anyone know
your child is lost.

757
01:38:16,504 --> 01:38:18,131
Or that you are upset.

758
01:38:24,178 --> 01:38:26,146
- Seen these?
- Yes sir.

759
01:38:27,181 --> 01:38:30,639
Then tell me how was Khanna's
nose, eyes, chin and lips.

760
01:38:31,185 --> 01:38:34,154
The eyes were like this.
And this was the chin.

761
01:38:35,189 --> 01:38:39,558
These were the lips.
The nose was either this or that.

762
01:39:17,231 --> 01:39:20,462
- What do you think?
- lt's Mr. Khanna all right.

763
01:39:21,569 --> 01:39:23,696
But you didn't make his moustache.

764
01:39:24,238 --> 01:39:26,798
- How was it?
- Hero cut.

765
01:39:35,249 --> 01:39:36,546
Like this?

766
01:39:37,251 --> 01:39:39,811
A deep wound scar here.

767
01:40:09,283 --> 01:40:12,582
Recognise it? lt's
your child's voice.

768
01:40:13,287 --> 01:40:14,845
My baby!

769
01:40:20,294 --> 01:40:24,253
Do you mean Mr. Rai's child?

770
01:40:24,699 --> 01:40:25,927
You know that better.

771
01:40:27,301 --> 01:40:30,099
l want to talk to his father.

772
01:40:30,705 --> 01:40:32,263
lf it's not you, put the phone down.

773
01:40:45,319 --> 01:40:46,786
Who are you?

774
01:40:56,330 --> 01:40:58,298
l am the child's mother.

775
01:40:58,733 --> 01:41:02,794
When you've owned this, tell us
the rest and take the baby back.

776
01:41:03,337 --> 01:41:06,636
But who are you?
Where do l come?

777
01:41:09,677 --> 01:41:13,306
Listen, if you act smart...

778
01:41:14,348 --> 01:41:16,111
Your child will suffer.

779
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:08,095
Give the line to Miss Meena.

780
01:42:11,405 --> 01:42:13,965
- When?
- No idea. She'd received a call.

781
01:43:38,158 --> 01:43:39,455
What are you doing here?

782
01:43:39,994 --> 01:43:41,461
l was going to the hotel.

783
01:43:42,496 --> 01:43:43,793
Jump in. l'm going there.

784
01:43:54,508 --> 01:43:59,468
This chap put one up on us.
Would you like me to try my way?

785
01:44:08,522 --> 01:44:13,482
Here's your Khanna. l made him
exactly as the hotel boy described.

786
01:44:13,861 --> 01:44:15,158
Now it's up to you.

787
01:44:22,870 --> 01:44:25,338
l've surely seen this man somewhere.

788
01:44:25,539 --> 01:44:28,906
- Where?
- Wait. Let me think.

789
01:44:29,543 --> 01:44:31,511
Where have l seen him?
At the hotel?

790
01:44:32,546 --> 01:44:35,549
ln the train? Or bus?

791
01:44:35,549 --> 01:44:38,177
ln the court?
ln Rai's hotel?

792
01:44:39,553 --> 01:44:40,850
No....

793
01:44:41,221 --> 01:44:42,518
Movie hall?

794
01:44:44,558 --> 01:44:46,526
Yes, in the picture.

795
01:44:58,906 --> 01:45:06,039
This is the man who died along with
motorbike on the night of the murder.

796
01:45:06,580 --> 01:45:08,548
The police is still
searching for his antecedents.

797
01:45:13,187 --> 01:45:16,554
There is only one person
wit you in joys and sorrows.

798
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:19,889
And that is me.

799
01:45:20,594 --> 01:45:25,554
l dread to think of our future
if this is how you'll behave.

800
01:45:28,602 --> 01:45:30,069
Why don't you tell me?

801
01:45:32,606 --> 01:45:34,073
What is the matter?

802
01:45:34,608 --> 01:45:38,567
- What is wrong with you?
- l don't understand anything!

803
01:45:39,613 --> 01:45:40,910
What do l do? Where do l go?

804
01:45:44,018 --> 01:45:48,580
l hate you, myself, everything!

805
01:45:49,023 --> 01:45:51,184
- Go away from here!
- Are you mad?

806
01:45:56,363 --> 01:45:57,591
No.

807
01:45:58,632 --> 01:46:00,429
Today l am not mad.

808
01:46:02,636 --> 01:46:07,596
l was mad, the day l got taken
in by your promise to marry me.

809
01:46:08,642 --> 01:46:10,610
And became a dancer in this hotel!

810
01:46:12,646 --> 01:46:17,015
l was mad the day l handed
my precious child over to you!

811
01:46:23,657 --> 01:46:27,616
Why are you talking like this?
Somebody has misled you.

812
01:46:28,328 --> 01:46:29,625
Somebody told you something.

813
01:46:30,664 --> 01:46:33,132
- Tell me who it was.
- Nobody misled me!

814
01:46:36,670 --> 01:46:40,470
Forgive me. l am as
worried as you are.

815
01:46:41,675 --> 01:46:44,371
Don't you know they
telephoned me too?

816
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:48,648
They will return the child
if we tell them the truth.

817
01:46:49,683 --> 01:46:52,652
- Why don't you tell them?
- How can l?

818
01:46:53,087 --> 01:46:56,318
We will be hanged and
Bani will inherit everything.

819
01:46:57,691 --> 01:46:59,659
Our child will die of starvation!

820
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:02,920
- ls this what you want?
- Why don't you tell the cops?

821
01:47:03,097 --> 01:47:04,325
lnform them.

822
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:07,997
Don't take their name.

823
01:47:08,702 --> 01:47:11,671
Don't' you know they will kill
baby before the cops get there?

824
01:47:12,706 --> 01:47:14,674
Then you won't find
the baby or its' body!

825
01:47:15,109 --> 01:47:17,669
lf you still insist, we'll call them.

826
01:47:18,312 --> 01:47:19,677
Your madness will kill the baby.

827
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:28,688
Take this. Here!

828
01:47:30,724 --> 01:47:34,023
Remember if the baby is harmed...

829
01:47:34,728 --> 01:47:36,195
You'll be responsible.

830
01:48:14,768 --> 01:48:18,499
Trust me. l'm doing my best.

831
01:48:20,274 --> 01:48:21,741
Your child will be found.

832
01:48:23,110 --> 01:48:24,509
Give me some time.

833
01:48:29,116 --> 01:48:32,347
l say think it over again,
This concerns the gutter.

834
01:48:32,786 --> 01:48:35,254
There's no time to think.
Say what you want to.

835
01:48:47,134 --> 01:48:49,432
Take this. Keep an eye.

836
01:49:56,203 --> 01:49:57,500
Hello constable.

837
01:49:57,871 --> 01:50:00,339
- Got a match?
- Yes. Here.

838
01:50:01,208 --> 01:50:02,835
That's a good lighter.
Where did you steal it?

839
01:50:03,877 --> 01:50:07,881
Not stolen, found.

840
01:50:07,881 --> 01:50:09,508
Belongs to the gutter.

841
01:50:10,884 --> 01:50:14,843
- Not finished work?
- The supervisor hasn't come.

842
01:50:15,222 --> 01:50:16,689
l'm waiting for him.

843
01:50:23,897 --> 01:50:25,865
lf l hadn't closed it,
we'd both be locked up.

844
01:50:26,900 --> 01:50:28,868
lt was a cop. Got rid
of him with difficulty.

845
01:50:29,903 --> 01:50:32,371
- l'm making a move.
- Wait for sometime.

846
01:50:32,572 --> 01:50:34,199
- l'm coming.
- Okay.

847
01:51:00,934 --> 01:51:02,902
- ls your master in?
- No.

848
01:51:07,341 --> 01:51:09,332
- Do you know when he'll return?
- No idea.

849
01:51:15,949 --> 01:51:17,917
- How is the baby?
- Baby?

850
01:51:18,352 --> 01:51:21,685
- The one your master brought..
- He didn't get any baby.

851
01:51:24,624 --> 01:51:25,921
What's your name?

852
01:51:29,963 --> 01:51:31,328
Listen...

853
01:51:33,467 --> 01:51:37,426
lf there is a baby here,
these 1000 bucks can be yours.

854
01:51:37,738 --> 01:51:40,366
- There's no child here.
- You're lying!

855
01:51:40,974 --> 01:51:42,942
Help! Help!

856
01:51:44,978 --> 01:51:46,343
Get up!

857
01:52:10,003 --> 01:52:11,630
Go in and check.

858
01:52:12,005 --> 01:52:15,702
Very good! Am l the only
fool to bell the cat?

859
01:52:16,009 --> 01:52:17,977
- You go in. - How?
- By the door.

860
01:52:19,012 --> 01:52:21,810
- Somebody might see me.
- Am l invisible?

861
01:52:26,753 --> 01:52:28,983
- lsn't Marina your friend?
- That's true.

862
01:52:33,026 --> 01:52:34,493
Go in through her.

863
01:52:35,362 --> 01:52:40,322
lt's safe till the compound.
l won't go in the building.

864
01:52:42,035 --> 01:52:43,662
- Then l'll go.
- Go ahead.

865
01:52:45,038 --> 01:52:48,496
But what do l answer Bani
if something happens to you?

866
01:52:48,775 --> 01:52:50,003
Let me go.

867
01:52:51,044 --> 01:52:55,003
- l'll go.
- So you will go?

868
01:52:55,549 --> 01:53:00,009
Who else? lf l don't return
assume l was of use to you.

869
01:53:12,065 --> 01:53:14,363
- l'm going to take Rai's statement
- What statement?

870
01:53:15,068 --> 01:53:16,695
- Confession to the crime.
- How?

871
01:53:17,070 --> 01:53:23,031
l have a trick. Be ready.
We'll nab Mrs. Rai's killer tonight.

872
01:53:59,112 --> 01:54:00,579
Tempers are rising.

873
01:54:07,521 --> 01:54:10,081
Are you mad at your sweetheart?

874
01:54:13,126 --> 01:54:15,094
l'm nobody's darling!

875
01:54:16,129 --> 01:54:18,757
You are crying. What's wrong?

876
01:54:19,132 --> 01:54:20,565
As if you care.

877
01:54:21,535 --> 01:54:24,095
What would you know about
what happened in these days!

878
01:54:25,138 --> 01:54:26,435
What happened?

879
01:54:27,474 --> 01:54:29,101
My master's baby is lost.

880
01:54:29,543 --> 01:54:32,444
No big deal. l'll call
the police station right now.

881
01:54:34,147 --> 01:54:36,911
No, sir has prohibited
us from telling anyone.

882
01:54:37,417 --> 01:54:39,612
- ls that so?
- l'll lose my job.

883
01:54:41,154 --> 01:54:45,614
John's sweetheart worried
about an ayah's job. Silly.

884
01:54:46,493 --> 01:54:48,518
Tell me who is in the house now?

885
01:54:49,162 --> 01:54:51,130
- Nobody.
- Nobody? Come along.

886
01:54:53,166 --> 01:54:56,135
- When will the master come?
- He's always late.

887
01:54:57,170 --> 01:54:58,535
Then let's go.

888
01:55:03,176 --> 01:55:06,145
- Till when are you on duty?
- Till night.

889
01:55:06,580 --> 01:55:09,606
lf Meena gets a call or
goes out, inform me.

890
01:55:10,584 --> 01:55:11,744
l'll be inside.

891
01:55:17,524 --> 01:55:21,654
lf the piano is removed,
it will look like my servant's room.

892
01:55:22,195 --> 01:55:28,498
- Servant's room? - Yes, my
house in Goa is 1000 times better.

893
01:55:32,205 --> 01:55:34,571
- Where is the switch board?
- What for?

894
01:55:34,874 --> 01:55:36,171
For the switch board machine.

895
01:55:37,210 --> 01:55:39,178
- What's that for?
- You.

896
01:55:39,613 --> 01:55:42,673
For your voice. To record it.

897
01:55:43,216 --> 01:55:45,776
The recording is for the
company which is for the job.

898
01:55:46,219 --> 01:55:47,686
The job is for you.

899
01:55:48,221 --> 01:55:49,586
And you...

900
01:55:51,224 --> 01:55:53,590
- Really?
- Yes. Where is it?

901
01:55:56,229 --> 01:55:58,197
Gently...

902
02:00:08,147 --> 02:00:09,774
My master is back! Hide!

903
02:00:31,504 --> 02:00:32,869
Meena, it's you?

904
02:00:35,508 --> 02:00:36,975
You may go.

905
02:00:45,518 --> 02:00:46,883
Just a minute, darling.

906
02:00:49,522 --> 02:00:51,490
No darling. Not yet.

907
02:00:53,526 --> 02:00:55,494
But l'm trying my best
to find the child.

908
02:00:56,529 --> 02:00:59,498
- Why do you worry?
- l know everything.

909
02:01:00,533 --> 02:01:03,502
l want my child or
l'll call the police!

910
02:01:05,538 --> 02:01:07,267
Are you out of your mind?

911
02:01:08,541 --> 02:01:11,009
Our hands are tainted with blood.

912
02:01:11,544 --> 02:01:13,341
We will be hanged.

913
02:01:13,546 --> 02:01:14,979
You worry about yourself.

914
02:01:15,214 --> 02:01:17,182
Let the police handle my child.

915
02:01:17,550 --> 02:01:20,519
Why are you saying this?
Why don't you understand?

916
02:01:22,555 --> 02:01:28,016
Look, you have delivered the
baby as Mrs. Rai in Delhi.

917
02:01:28,962 --> 02:01:31,522
You travelled with my wife
from there to Bombay.

918
02:01:32,565 --> 02:01:34,533
You left your child
in the compartment.

919
02:01:35,568 --> 02:01:37,536
l did this because you asked me to.

920
02:01:38,905 --> 02:01:42,534
All right. But nobody other than
you and me were witness to this.

921
02:01:46,579 --> 02:01:49,548
l sent Khanna along with my wife.

922
02:01:51,184 --> 02:01:55,553
Now if you go to the police,
you too will be in trouble.

923
02:01:55,989 --> 02:01:57,957
For my child's sake,
l'm ready to be hanged!

924
02:01:58,591 --> 02:02:03,551
- l'll go to the police.
- That won't be right.

925
02:02:05,598 --> 02:02:10,058
But if you insist,
l'll complain to the police.

926
02:02:11,604 --> 02:02:13,071
Rest assured.

927
02:02:15,608 --> 02:02:17,576
l'll rest only after
you have got your child.

928
02:02:21,614 --> 02:02:23,582
He's put the phone down.

929
02:02:26,285 --> 02:02:27,582
You may leave.

930
02:03:16,669 --> 02:03:20,127
John's life is in this.
Some other time.

931
02:03:31,684 --> 02:03:33,652
What a man! l'd have
suffered a heart failure!

932
02:03:34,020 --> 02:03:36,045
- Job done?
- Our job is done.

933
02:03:36,689 --> 02:03:38,452
But somebody else will be ruined.

934
02:03:38,691 --> 02:03:41,159
- What happened?
- He kept the phone down

935
02:03:41,694 --> 02:03:45,323
And got a pistol. l thought
Motilal's is on the hit list.

936
02:03:46,099 --> 02:03:47,657
But thank goodness he didn't see me.

937
02:03:48,201 --> 02:03:51,329
- Then..?
- He drove off in the car.

938
02:03:51,704 --> 02:03:54,502
l'm still sweating. Let's go.

939
02:04:19,732 --> 02:04:21,700
Ajay here. Rai is going to kill you!

940
02:04:22,735 --> 02:04:25,363
Save yourself somehow.
l'm informing the police.

941
02:04:25,738 --> 02:04:27,706
- ls this a joke?
- Hurry, inspector.

942
02:04:28,074 --> 02:04:30,042
Rai has gone to the
hotel to kill Meena.

943
02:04:30,409 --> 02:04:33,708
- Who is he?
- Step here.

944
02:04:35,748 --> 02:04:38,376
He's the man who got Khanna to
kill his wife at Bombay Central.

945
02:04:38,751 --> 02:04:40,309
And then killed him.

946
02:04:40,753 --> 02:04:42,220
But who are you?

947
02:08:35,988 --> 02:08:39,287
Throw away the pistol
or you'll be shot.

948
02:08:39,992 --> 02:08:42,290
lf you step forward, l'll kill her!

949
02:09:04,016 --> 02:09:05,984
You've followed death, not me.

950
02:09:36,048 --> 02:09:39,677
Our hands are tainted with blood.
We will be hanged.

951
02:09:40,052 --> 02:09:41,417
Why don't you understand?

952
02:09:42,054 --> 02:09:45,023
You delivered a child in a
Delhi maternity home as Mrs. Rai.

953
02:09:45,724 --> 02:09:48,022
You travelled with my wife
from Delhi to Bombay.

954
02:09:49,061 --> 02:09:51,689
You left your child
in the compartment.

955
02:09:53,065 --> 02:09:54,760
l did that because you asked me to.

956
02:09:56,469 --> 02:09:58,528
No one was witness to that
other than you and me.

957
02:10:00,072 --> 02:10:03,041
l sent Khanna to where my wife is.

958
02:10:04,076 --> 02:10:06,806
lf you still wish,
you may go to the police.

959
02:10:07,079 --> 02:10:10,048
But remember we won't be safe.

960
02:10:14,086 --> 02:10:18,716
All this proves that the
accused, Bani is innocent.

961
02:10:19,492 --> 02:10:22,393
Bani is hereby released with honour.

962
02:10:43,115 --> 02:10:44,582
Excuse me.

963
02:10:57,630 --> 02:11:01,088
This proves that the
accused Bani is a killer.

964
02:11:02,134 --> 02:11:09,097
And so skillful that she ruined
Ajay in just one glance.

965
02:11:10,142 --> 02:11:14,101
Therefore by the lndian
Penal Code, section 302..

966
02:11:15,548 --> 02:11:21,111
Bani is sentenced to life
imprisonment in Ajay's cell.

967
02:11:22,154 --> 02:11:26,113
The court is adjourned
for the honeymoon season.
