00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:22,743
<i>He is a collection king.</i>

2
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:28,285
<i>He's a collection king.</i>

3
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,529
<i>He's a collection king.</i>

4
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,307
<i>He's a collection king.</i>

5
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:12,388
<i>He's a collection king.</i>

6
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,733
My hand...
Leave my hand man.

7
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,230
Hi Gangaroo...

8
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,067
Not Gangaroo. He's Gangarathan.

9
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,271
He's Gangadaran.

10
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:27,136
What's it?

11
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,680
Didn't you say that we can't collect
money from you?

12
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,918
Did you see?
l've hired the collection king.

13
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:36,088
Hey, don't talk too much.

14
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:40,483
Am l an auto or a horse to be hired?
Give respect to my profession.

15
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,092
Are you the one who
hasn't given the payment?

16
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,094
Then why're you looking
like a decent man?

17
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:51,601
Why haven't you returned his money?

18
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:52,828
Take the phone.

19
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,170
l'll give the phone to you.

20
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:59,271
you ask your wife to
bring Rs.20 lakhs here.- Why?

21
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,607
Otherwise your body will be
sent to your house in instalments.

22
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:03,440
Hey phone...

23
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,618
Tell me which part of your body,
your wife likes most.

24
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:06,785
l'll first cut that &
send it to your house.

25
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:07,782
My beard.

26
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,614
Then you cut his neck
and sent it to his house.

27
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:12,450
Why did you entrust me to these rowdies?
- He's calling you rowdy!

28
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,058
Hey, whom are you calling rowdy?
- l'll kill you.

29
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,121
What we're doing is social service.

30
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,126
We'll collect money and do charity.

31
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,629
For example, 20 lakhs which
you should pay him,

32
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,800
will be collected by us from you.

33
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:25,459
We'll take our 10% commission from that
and give the rest to him.

34
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,139
Understand? This is our rule.

35
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,466
Now you talk about the money.

36
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:29,801
l gave it to your brother, didn't l?

37
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,807
He collected half of
the money & went to Dubai.

38
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:35,139
Don't talk about him.
l want my money.

39
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,144
Why did you give it to him?

40
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,976
You only asked me
to give it to your brother.

41
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,214
l just blabbered when l was boozed.
Why did you take it seriously?

42
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,155
Collection king, ask him.

43
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,149
Why're you beating me?

44
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:49,158
You made me to go wrong.
- Ask him like that.

45
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:49,828
No, he's at fault.

46
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:50,825
This is wrong.

47
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,497
Hey give the phone.

48
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,329
Call your wife.- Why?

49
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,367
Tell me which part she likes?
l'll cut that & send it to her.

50
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:58,901
His beard.

51
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,500
Shit! This case seems to be problematic.

52
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:03,835
Call your wife,

53
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,510
and ask her to bring 2 lakhs.
- Why?

54
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,509
10% in 20 lakhs is 2 lakhs.

55
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,181
You made us to lose that amount
by your lie.- What's this edict?

56
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,440
Phone your wife.

57
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,113
Why're you phoning me
instead of phoning your wife.

58
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:14,845
Hello....- Hello.

59
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,521
Father...- Dear...

60
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,520
l didn't say 'dear'...
Wrong connection.

61
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:19,521
No right connection.

62
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,695
Vatti...Dr.Vatti...- Yes Dr.Raja.

63
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:27,525
Discharge the old patient Gangadaran.

64
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:31,534
Admit the new patient Maniraja.- Oh god!

65
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:34,873
Point is, they're taking
away the patients on stretchers.

66
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,735
Here full of patients...
everything is fine.

67
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,733
You along with mother.

68
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,606
When are you coming? Tomorrow?

69
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:41,607
Oh god.

70
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:44,216
No...l said 'wow'.

71
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,884
There's no signal.
That's... you've heard like that.

72
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,713
You come.
We'll receive you happily.

73
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:49,546
Okay father.

74
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,225
Hey Kalaialangaram...
- What brother?

75
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,223
Again rearrange

<i>He's a favourite doctor for men</i>
<i>and lovable doctor for women.</i>

Hubby, why there is no one here?
- They will come...

93
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,679
Hey...Pickpocket.- Leave me.

94
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:58,009
Hey...catch him...
- Don't beat me.

95
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,947
Stop beating him...
it's an empty purse.

96
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,521
lt's enough, go men.

97
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,687
You've grown up, haven't you?
Why're you doing such thing?

98
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,086
l left my native place & came here.

99
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,691
l don't know how to lead proper life.
That's why l stole.

100
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,194
My son had also left his native place.

101
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,192
Do you know, what is he now?

102
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,426
Welcome, bless me.- Long live.

103
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:18,965
l got late because of the traffic.

104
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,706
Look, come with me.

105
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,706
My son is a great doctor.
He'll heal your wounds.

106
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,046
SRlMAAN VENKATRAMAN FREE HOSPlTAL.

107
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:32,244
My son has built this
hospital in my name.

108
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:33,886
Very proud!

109
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,386
Come on father.
- Please come.

110
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:43,118
Everything is alright?

111
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:49,391
lt's a very busy hospital.
Look, how many patients are there.

112
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,330
Where is Raja?

113
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,470
Brother, your parents have come.
What're you doing?

114
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,079
l had told them that
you're doing an operation.

115
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,247
Why did you say like that?

116
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,416
Being a doctor,
you should wear a coat.

117
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,016
Shouldn't a doctor eat?

118
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:09,413
Let's all do the operation.
- We too?

119
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,249
Don't you know about 'co-operation'?
You just do that.

120
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,689
Assistant, you hold this leg.
You hold this leg.

121
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,487
l also want a leg.
- You hold this.

122
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:22,260
l'm going to cut the hand now.

123
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:26,370
Come here.
He's operating the hand.

124
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,937
What is patient's name?
- Broiler doctor.

125
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:30,442
Have you informed its family?

126
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,440
All its relatives
are here.

127
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,512
All belong to one family.
- You're a family doctor, right?

128
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:39,944
Doctor, when are we discharging the
patient?- When?

129
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:42,279
lt has gone inside, right?

130
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:43,512
Then it can be discharged
only in the morning.

131
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,451
Without laughing, do the operation.

132
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,991
Will you have this?- Yes.

133
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,387
ls it over? Doctor.

134
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:53,995
What's this?

135
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,631
Why condiment smell is coming
from the operation theatre?

136
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,464
That is...world is like that.

137
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:03,199
People are demanding 'masala movies'
in theatres as well as in hospitals.

138
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:04,806
Those movies are shown in theatres,

139
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,342
and operation is
also done in theatres.

140
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,876
This man is suffering
from severe pain.

141
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:11,976
lt seems like 'inner wound'.
- lnner wound?

142
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,151
Greetings doctor.- Greetings.

143
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,149
Oh, you...are you doctor?

144
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,151
Admit him.
0 Come on...we'll give you treatment.

145
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:18,823
Hey take the patient carefully.

146
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,152
Why did you lock him inside?

147
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,659
You said its an 'inner wound', right?
That's why, l had sent him inside.

148
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,661
lf there was a wound on his outer body,
we would've treated him outside.

149
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,493
lf it's...
- 'Perukayam'(big wound).

150
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,002
We'll put assafoetida in the gravy.

151
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,338
Sir, l've bought the money you asked for.
- Come on...slowly...

152
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,506
You please send my husband back.

153
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,334
Vatti, explain to her.

154
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:37,676
Sir, l've bought interest also.

155
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,345
You'll get a good husband.
lt's enough for me.

156
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,844
Why're you not
choosing a proper husband?

157
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,517
Come on...He's in that ward.
He's still a patient.

158
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:46,514
My husband....

159
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,119
Come man...- They said that your
parents have come.

160
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:50,689
Give it them.

161
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,052
Wow! You really look like a doctor.

162
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,195
You too look like a tender coconut seller.
Did l pass any comment?

163
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,727
What's it on the tender coconut?

164
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:03,026
You carry on.

165
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,862
Won't you believe
our brother is a doctor?

166
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,373
l've seen you here earlier.
Haven't you got cured yet?

167
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:09,799
What's your complaint?

168
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,806
Heart attack.

169
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,044
Brother..

170
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,886
Are they giving you an award?
Why're you acting too much?

171
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,059
Having a fractured hand,
you're saying 'heart attack'?

172
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,556
Does this briefcase has correct amount?
- Yes.

173
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,229
Go without tension.
Your husband will come home.

174
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,730
Don't beat...- lf l see you here
next time...

175
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:36,833
Don't come to this area.

176
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,398
Amount is collected.
You can go now.

177
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:43,071
Hey, what is happening here?
- 'Big show' go man...

178
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,106
Oh god.- Go man...

179
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,575
Brother, for how long you should
be in the disguise of a doctor?

180
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:52,580
Do you know the proverb?

181
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,582
One day or other,
quack doctor will get caught.

182
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:55,913
That is meant for thieves.

183
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,749
Let it be l'm talking
about quack doctors.

184
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,584
Brother, are you finished?
Lets go down.

185
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,260
Why is he interfering?

186
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,919
lf it's a personal matter,
why can't you go down & talk privately?

187
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,599
Why're you standing on
such a high building?

188
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,099
l'm afraid of heights.
l'm scared to see actor Amitab batchaan.

189
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,602
You're afraid of heights,
and brother is afraid of his father.

190
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,275
Brother, why can't you tell
your father that you're not a doctor?

191
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:19,944
Why do you want me to remove my
moustache for a week's play.

192
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,280
You start first.

193
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:25,644
Mother, brother wants to
talk an important matter with father.

194
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:38,286
Dad, l want to talk about a
real..true thing to you. - Both are same.

195
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,096
ls it? - Yes.

196
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:45,736
You might have thought that
l'm a doctor.

197
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,833
l'm not the doctor as you think.
- Then what type of a doctor are you?

198
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:56,974
l'm, in this locality... with my friends...
collecting. l'm doing that only.

199
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:00,949
You're collecting huge money from rich,
and treating poor people free.

200
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,984
No, the way l earn money is...

201
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:06,681
What is there in earning money?
A smuggler is earning.

202
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,259
A village panchayat
leader is earning.

203
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,187
A rowdy is earning.

204
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:16,432
Hubby, he's trying to say something...
but he's afraid..

205
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,891
Come here dear.

206
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:23,506
'Embracing therapy'.

207
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,274
Now have you got the courage?

208
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:30,544
Tell your father.

209
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,778
l don't know whether
l've the courage.

210
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:36,112
But l've lost fear,
and become clear.

211
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,790
Now l'm not confused.
- What was your confusion?

212
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:45,889
Nothing. As you've been
thinking, l'm a doctor. l can't change it.

213
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,896
Brother, inspite of doing so many rehearsals,
why did you spoil our entire plan?

214
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:56,132
Mother gave 'Embracing therapy'.
So l became brave & told lies.- Why?

215
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:00,235
Did you see my father?
He has become old.

216
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,971
l would've told the truth,
if he was middle aged.

217
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:07,384
lf l tell him the truth,
and he might die of heart attack.

218
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:10,987
Having dot & flowers,
my mother looks beautiful. Without them....

219
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:15,251
Oh god! Why're you talking like this?
She's mother for us also.

220
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,194
You're a doctor.

221
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,762
Hey go man...go...

222
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:21,926
Mind your work.

223
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,647
How is your business going on?
- lt's going on smoothly.

224
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:39,547
Who are they?

225
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,447
Why're they unnecessarily
laughing in the park?

226
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:42,811
What do they want?

227
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,817
Since they're very rich
they've gone mad.

228
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:49,326
Okay, let them go to hell.
Give me a tender coconut.

229
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,897
Give me a tender coconut.
- Okay sir.

230
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,867
Excuse me Sir, l've seen you somewhere.

231
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,765
Doctor Viswanath?- Yes.

232
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,303
You're Mr.Venkatraman,
aren't you?- Correct.

233
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,239
Sir, do you know him?

234
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,406
When they built a hospital in
our village for the 1st. time,

235
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:18,056
he was the 1st doctor there and worked
for 2 years.- Yes 2 years

236
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,019
How are you here?

237
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,786
Have you heard of
''Srimaan Venkatraman Hospital''.

238
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,858
Who's hospital is that?
- Dr.Rajaraman?

239
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:27,955
He is my son.

240
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,498
Surprising! - What is surprising about it?

241
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,728
We slice the coconut thinking it'll be tender,
but it turns out to be immature.

242
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:36,840
No...l know all the
doctors in this city.

243
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,806
Who is Rajaraman?
- He's a famous doctor.

244
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,507
Sir, do you want tender coconut or
immature one? - Will you please shut up?

245
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,891
Why all of them were laughing?

246
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:59,164
lt was an exercise for good health.
lt's called 'Laughter therapy'.

247
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,435
lf you lose your temper,
you should start laughing.

248
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:04,667
Your Blood pressure will come down.

249
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,674
How can you laugh,
when you're getting angry?- lt's difficult.

250
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,574
But if you practice,
it is possible.

251
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,074
Okay leave it. How is
your daughter, Pappu?

252
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,579
She is fine. She has gone
to the hospital.

253
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,474
You said she is fine and
she has gone to the hospital?

254
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:23,121
She is a doctor.
She has studied medicine.- Doctor?

255
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:27,484
ls she married?- No,
that is a big problem.

256
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,656
l've shown 50 doctor's
photos to her.

257
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,190
She is asking me, how can
l marry a stranger?

258
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:40,395
The one who was friendly with her,
and l know him for a long time.

259
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:44,108
He is also a doctor, good boy.

260
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,777
Wow! lt's there in the pocket.

261
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,211
Look, he is the boy.
Tell your opinion.

262
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,420
ls he your son, Raja?

263
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,953
l can give this photo
through an exchange offer.

264
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,719
l got your point.
You're asking for bride's photo. l'll give.

265
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:06,194
Being a doctor,
l'm telling you seriously...

266
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,897
Father, l'm not interested
in marriage.

267
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,070
Finally, what do you want to say?

268
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:17,037
Finally what can l say?
l'll ask her about it.

269
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,068
What's it dear?

270
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:22,043
Mother, l'm a doctor. l'm not interested
in marriage. Tell him.

271
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:27,150
lt's not that dear.
- Kasthuri, stop cajoling him, let's go.

272
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,819
Where are you going?- To our place.
- Why?

273
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,283
Look, you can't deceive me.

274
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,391
Now you aren't the doctor.- Oh god!

275
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,092
You're my son.
- You got tensed so soon.

276
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,061
He's right.

277
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,765
Shouldn't we've the desire to fondle
our grand children?

278
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:46,260
Doctor...

279
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,704
They're calling you only.

280
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:49,832
Tell me.

281
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:53,001
Not that.

282
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:58,914
Your opinion about my marriage.
- No marriage.

283
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,982
No? Why?

284
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,883
Already you both got married, right?
- May be at the age of 60...- Hey doctor.

285
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,491
What?

286
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,157
He's a day doctor and
he's a night doctor. He's leaving after duty.

287
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,421
Operation is waiting.
l'll see you later.

288
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,064
Father, you sit down.

289
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,599
Who is Rajaram? He's a doctor.

290
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:22,031
22 hrs duty. He can't
close the shop.- Shop?

291
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,574
That is, he can't close the door of the
hospital. Will his would-be know this?

292
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:29,908
That's why, if his would-be is a doctor,
then she will know him better.- You are right.

293
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,451
A doctor's problem is known
better only to another doctor.

294
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,154
Why're you laughing?

295
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:38,146
lt's coming.

296
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:40,381
Why?

297
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,493
Tomorrow we're going to
see the bride. She is also a doctor.

298
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,519
Brother, l will wait outside.

299
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,127
Give the photo.

300
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:49,695
Can you recognise her?

301
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,703
l've heard about 'child specialist'.
But here a child itself is a doctor?

302
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,238
Tell me who is this child?
- l don't know.

303
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,067
Pappu.

304
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:00,007
Oh! Neighbour Pappu.

305
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,908
Neighbour Pappu.- My neighbour Pappu.
Will you be quiet?

306
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:06,312
Look tomorrow at 9.30 a.m.
- lnauspicious time...?

307
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:08,247
No, we're going to see the bride.

308
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,949
Because of your views,
now l've to see that doctor bride.

309
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,260
Brother, l said like that
to save you.

310
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,625
That Pope....- Which Pope?

311
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,266
That 'Seepu'...- Seepu?

312
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,067
Yuck! Say 'Pappu'.

313
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:27,033
How could l know that
she is a doctor?

314
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,672
You're the only doctor,
who l know.

315
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,631
What to do? You too aren't a doctor.

316
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,504
How long have you been friendly
with that 'Pappu'?

317
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:38,012
She is 'Pappu' man.
- Okay 'Pappu'.

318
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:39,680
l know her from my childhood.

319
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:40,983
That means?

320
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,187
lt's the opposite of grown up.
Don't irritate me.

321
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,019
l mean to say that
l know her from my childhood.

322
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:49,686
ln the childhood, being smart,
fair and having chubby cheeks,

323
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,920
and combing the hair properly,

324
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,928
and applying powder around the neck.

325
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,566
Brother...you're really great.

326
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,065
You remember 'Pappu'
of childhood days.

327
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,630
Hell with you.
l'm talking about myself.

328
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,364
l was looking like
that in my childhood.

329
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,975
Then Pappu?- She also
looked like that.

330
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,908
Her body & figure varied,
since she's a girl.

331
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:10,547
We were playing exuberantly.
- Then what?

332
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,343
She matches you, right? Marry her.

333
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:14,483
You're talking without
knowing the facts.

334
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:18,417
That girl is dreaming to marry a real
doctor. Do you want me to spoil that?

335
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,182
You've to rape her
on your nuptial night,

336
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,485
after that, tell her that
you aren't a doctor.

337
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:27,791
l didn't mean that. - You fix another
day for that.- Excellent, he is right.

338
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,025
What's right?
Nuptial night for one week?

339
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:37,842
Just a minute please.

340
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:42,104
Pappu...

341
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,079
Guess who's on the line?

342
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,405
Who is it?- Groom.

343
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,619
Dr.Raja is on the line.
Talk to him.

344
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,222
Talk nicely.

345
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:59,096
Dad, if you don't mind. - No, l
don't mind. You carry on... - But l mind.

346
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,446
Raja, you've troubled me
a lot in my childhood.

347
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,741
Now, fate is bringing me closer to you.

348
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,886
Why l phoned you is to tell you that
l'm not your old friend Raja.

349
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,248
Now l've changed a lot.
Now l'm called 'collecting Raja'.

350
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,853
lf you want me to explain,

351
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,190
it's like rowdy, Dada
and collecting debts etc.

352
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,498
l'm not interested in marriage.

353
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:39,500
Since my parents forced me,
l've agreed to come & see you.

354
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:44,466
When l come there,
you reject me giving some reason.

355
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:45,768
Don't insult me badly.

356
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:49,141
Really? What reason shall l give them?
You tell me.

357
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,908
Tell them ''Groom is very handsome.
So l don't like him''.

358
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:53,812
Joke?- lt's not a joke.

359
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:59,082
Look, if my father comes to knows that
l'm not a doctor, that's all...

360
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,653
He's an honest... - Police officer?

361
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,021
Should the word 'honest' always
relate to a police officer?

362
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,253
He's a school teacher.

363
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,830
lf he comes to know about this,
he will be worried.

364
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:12,493
lf you respect our 20 yrs friendship,
don't tell anything to him, okay?

365
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:15,832
He can't tolerate it.
He will die of heart attack.

366
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,532
He will live for 100 years.
- What is the matter?

367
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:23,437
Raja, l'm also not a doctor,
as you think. l'm a Cabaret dancer.

368
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,114
My father is owning a wine shop.

369
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,150
So when you come to see the bride,
say ''l don't like her''.

370
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:31,220
Father, l'm talking to my friend
regarding medical matters.

371
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:32,646
Bye.

372
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,315
Are you making fun of me?

373
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,988
l'm talking to you and
you're looking at the photo?

374
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:41,859
Sir, do you want to collect
balance amount from any person?

375
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:42,624
No.

376
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,359
Are you going to kidnap someone?
- What do you mean?

377
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:47,799
Then why're you keeping
this photo here?

378
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,406
He is the one who is
going to marry Pappu.

379
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:54,536
What? Are you going to perform
Pappu's marriage with a rowdy?

380
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:55,709
What're you blabbering?

381
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:59,107
You own such a big hospital.

382
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,477
You don't know to select a
good groom for your daughter.

383
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:10,551
Look dear, don't cry. l'll get you
married to a prince.

384
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:26,237
Hi. - Hi daddy.

385
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,603
You didn't go to the hospital?

386
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,748
No, you said that
Raja is coming, right?

387
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,039
l forgot to tell you.

388
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,185
He phoned, it seems they're
coming here after a week.

389
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:37,747
You can go to the hospital.

390
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:39,088
Okay, what about you?

391
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:43,289
l've some work. l'll come later.
- Okay Bye.

392
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,095
You may even perform my
marriage.- We will.

393
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:56,536
lf it gets late.... Hey Raja, come here...
- l'm coming.

394
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,272
lf l get late....

395
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:03,346
You phone me frequently.- Okay.
Say emergency, urgent work etc.- Okay.

396
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:12,180
Hello, doctor here.Brother,
l'm Vatti speaking. Hey who is fooling me?

397
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,454
Vatti is standing infront of me...
- lt's me only.

398
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,057
Why did you call me on phone?

399
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:18,559
Didn't you ask me to phone you
frequently?- But not this way.

400
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,453
Then?

401
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:22,861
Okay. Hello...- Hello.
Put the phone down.- Okay.

402
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:24,798
There's no pocket.

403
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,298
Even there, there is no pocket.
- Okay.- lt's nothing father.

404
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,332
There's no pocket in my shirt.

405
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,601
Phone me later.

406
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:36,370
l'll come.

407
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:39,976
What's this Hubby?

408
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,486
'Laughter Therapy' to decrease tension.

409
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:49,921
Well doctor Raja...

410
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,528
ln which college,
did you study medicine?

411
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,830
The one which is before
the central station.

412
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:00,933
Central jail is there.

413
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:02,832
No, that is on the
other side of the canal.

414
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:08,604
There's a general hospital
on its other end.- Wow! Lovely.

415
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,505
Great doctors have studied
in that famous hospital.

416
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,207
Your phone is ringing.

417
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:18,083
l'm Vatti here.
- Yes doctor speaking.

418
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,190
Brother, is everything
going on smoothly?

419
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:21,222
ls it?

420
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:24,524
You do one thing you give a
bottle of glucose to the patient.

421
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:26,856
l'm on the way. Ask them not to worry.

422
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,568
l like your commitment.

423
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:37,466
lt seems you've opened a
hospital on your father's name?

424
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,404
He was telling me proudly.

425
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:43,337
Look at his face.
Look how proud he feels.

426
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:48,247
Let it ring. Why're you getting tensed?

427
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,988
l'll give you as much as
you want for marrying my daughter.

428
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,021
Money?!

429
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,591
Why brother isn't picking up the phone?

430
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:02,324
Father, we'll make a move. You
consider that l didn't like this girl.

431
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:03,996
Who are you man?

432
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:05,763
Are you a doctor like my daughter?

433
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,572
Do you've the right to marry her?

434
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,577
What's happening here?

435
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:15,346
Your son isn't a
doctor as you think.

436
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,274
He's a rowdy.

437
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:18,608
Shut up.

438
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,416
He's collecting money
by organising committees.

439
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:27,050
He'll threaten, beat or kidnap people
for money. This is his profession.

440
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:32,756
lf you're unaware of it,
you're a big fool in this world.

441
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:34,831
Please ask him.

442
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:35,722
Tell me.

443
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:42,763
Raja, you...aren't you a doctor?

444
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:02,725
We unnecessarily troubled you.

445
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:05,392
Please forgive us.

446
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,040
Great insult.

447
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:27,145
Doctor, No:2 patient is very serious.

448
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,317
Doctor please come immediately.

449
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:31,712
Out...

450
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:44,266
How is it possible?

451
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:48,263
You didn't beat or hit me.

452
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:52,041
But you have taken
away my soul!

453
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:53,177
Get lost.

454
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,846
Come on let's go.
- Where hubby?

455
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:57,941
We should go some where
away from him. That's all.

456
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:03,184
lf you leave me and go, there's no
one for me. What can l do?

457
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,015
Being an elderly person,
don't you know?

458
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:09,357
You garland our photo & keep it.

459
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:13,262
Hereafter, there's no relationship
between you and me.

460
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:14,122
Understood?

461
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:16,292
Go man.

462
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:20,697
No...don't make me
cry once again.

463
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:21,766
Go...

464
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:28,038
Get lost.- Get lost.
- l'm going.

465
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,403
Come on..

466
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,080
Why did you lie?
- Mother, out of fear l said like that.

467
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:43,724
After leaving our place and earning
so much of money here,

468
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:46,396
l thought father will ask me
''How are you?''.

469
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,566
lnstead he asked me
''what are you doing''?

470
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:54,566
lnstead of worrying him,
l lied that l've become a doctor.

471
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:59,574
l said like that to make him happy.
Mother, l've told the truth, right?

472
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:00,802
What have you decided?

473
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:05,981
His decision is mine.

474
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:28,469
What did l say?

475
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,306
What did l say man?

476
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,074
l requested her to say that
she's not interested in this marriage,

477
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:34,535
and she didn't like me.

478
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:39,478
l told her not to hurt my father,
but she has behaved otherwise?

479
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,315
Brother, Pappu has revealed the truth.
Tell me, how should we punish her?

480
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:47,287
We can't do anything to her.
l know her from my childhood.

481
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,455
l'm destined to be like this, forget it.

482
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:54,495
Who is that removing the board? l've
written my father's name. Let it be there.

483
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,599
Let it be as it is.

484
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,263
l'm a strong man.

485
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:04,171
He had said that
l've taken away his soul.

486
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,672
Why did he say like that?
- Why?

487
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:08,743
Because l'm a fool.

488
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:10,643
l'm not a doctor.

489
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:14,015
What should l do as a son?
- What you should do?

490
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:15,680
l should become a doctor.

491
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,948
Okay, you become one. Lets talk
about it in the morning.

492
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,922
Since l'm boozed up, you want
me to talk in the morning?

493
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:25,756
l'm very clear.
l'm going to marry Pappu.

494
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,524
l'm going to join a medical
college and become a doctor.

495
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:33,466
l'm going to make her father laugh
throughout his life.

496
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:36,037
lf a hero says, he will do it,
only then he's called a 'hero'.

497
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,064
He knows 'Sidda'.

498
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:40,201
He knows even tricks.

499
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,235
He knows to read pulse.

500
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,408
He knows to read people's mind.

501
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:59,892
He's a versatile doctor.

502
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:05,363
Oldy, where we'll get admission?

503
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:07,398
Here we'll get admission.- Here?

504
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:09,736
Can't you see the board?
- Govindasamy, have your chit.

505
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:11,340
You've got the admission.
- Thank you.

506
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,676
Brother, you were feeling shy.

507
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:16,847
That old man got the admission.
- How is it possible?

508
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:18,973
Don't know what was his challenge?

509
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,783
ls this queue meant for challengers?

510
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:27,747
What man?- Give way.
- ls this an admission queue?- Yes.

511
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:28,823
You're standing
at the right place.

512
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:31,791
Why all are looking sick persons?

513
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,825
Here you'll be admitted,
if you fall sick.

514
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:37,330
What are you talking? Do we've to become
criminals before becoming lawyers?

515
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,196
Do we've to become thieves,
before becoming policemen?

516
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,497
Do we've to become bachelors,
before getting married?

517
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:42,205
Am l right?

518
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:44,932
Why're you confusing me?
Come here man.

519
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:46,635
Leave it and come.

520
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:49,869
l've not come here to get
admitted as a patient.

521
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:52,678
l want to join the
medical college & become a doctor.

522
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:53,974
Really?

523
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:58,787
Same thing.- What? l was in the
mental hospital for 10 years.

524
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,792
l used to stay that
''l want to become a health minister''.

525
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,062
Who? - Me. Oh god.
They treated me and left me here.

526
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:08,124
You also join here.
You'll become alright.

527
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,468
Go and meet the Dean.
Everybody can become a doctor.

528
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:12,963
Dean is in the theatre.

529
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,600
Shall l take leave?- Okay.

530
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,178
They said theatre,
but it's like a different place.

531
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,847
Why is he lying down?

532
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,646
Doctor, have you allowed them
inside by collecting tickets?

533
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,682
All look like murderers.
Who's the Dean here?

534
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:35,918
What is happening here? Out...
who are you? All of you get out. Nonsense.

535
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,294
Get lost. What's this injustice?

536
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:45,660
Like something entering through
an open door...- Are you calling us dogs?

537
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,495
Am l wrong?

538
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:48,862
Why're you relating the
word'something' to dogs?

539
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:54,009
lt may be lion, tiger.- Hey, we want
to get an admission urgently.

540
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:56,237
For that, how can you come
inside the operation theatre?

541
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:59,007
To do 2 operations at the same time,
is our Dean, a barber?

542
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,115
Or is this a hair cutting saloon?

543
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,081
My brother wants a
medical seat in this college.

544
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:04,851
There's an entrance examination.

545
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,455
You score high marks in that.

546
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:07,552
Only then you'll
get the admission.

547
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,317
Do you want our brother to
write an entrance examination?

548
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:13,224
Whether he's brother or grandfather,
entrance examination is compulsory.

549
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:14,394
Did you write it?

550
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,095

551
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,535
Congratulations.

553
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:25,803

00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,035

555
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,938

556
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,217

What operation is going on inside?

561
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:44,488
Don't forget to wash your hands.

562
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,830
Brother, come without
touching anyone.

563
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:49,556
Sorry, l suspected all of you.
- lt is alright.

564
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,903
Even my father used to say that

00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:59,338
you will write well in the exam.

Collection king, listen to me.

lt's wrong to write

Am l afraid to write exams.?

571

l couldn't get through the exams.
from my 5th std.

572
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,018
When l was in 5th std,
l failed in all the subjects.

573
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:23,361
Shut up.
Hey don't use a bad word.

Okay, leave it.

Then you'll go to college.

584
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:07,909

00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:08,017
Write down that his hand is
fractured and bones are broken.

675
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:09,192
He is alright, isn't it?

676
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,985
l'm talking about his future.

677
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:12,525
Sir, don't want.
He's a good doctor.

678
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,698
Shouldn't a good doctor
treat a patient?

679
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:18,364
l'll treat him, leave my hand.
- Treat him.

680
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,701
You should place it on
your ear and see, am l right?

681
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,040
l've become a doctor
after studying MBBS.

682
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,042
Sorry, l'm a first year student,
l just had a doubt.

683
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:30,872
You carry on.

684
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:32,548
Have a look without
giving him pain.

685
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,717
Thanks a lot.

686
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,219
What poison did he take?
- Rat poison.

687
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:38,213
Rat poison.

688
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,557
Rat poison.

689
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:53,566
Madam, before closing the counter,
show me the way first.

690
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,898
Look, talk to my father about everything.

691
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:58,571
Where is your father?
Tell me the way to go there.

692
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:01,741
Oh since you don't know the way,
you didn't come that day?

693
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:03,743
When?- Have you forgotten?

694
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,413
Do you know Adyar bridge?

695
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:08,915
Near that bridge,
if you turn right? On the left side...

696
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,246
Are you poking fun?
Does your college extend upto Adyar?

697
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:12,422
lf l ask ''where is 3rd
year class'',

698
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:13,749
you may say
''it's in Chengalpet''.

699
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:15,425
Are you making fun of me?

700
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:16,593
l'm a first year student.

701
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,762
lf l create problem, then
you've to close the college.

702
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:21,423
Student? They said you're a doctor.

703
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:22,257
My boys would've said that.

704
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:26,265
They're predicting my future title.

705
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,438
Anyhow, l'm going to be
Rajaram MBBS.

706
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,766
For the time being, l'm 93.5 F.M.

707
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:32,101
Give the full form of F.M.

708
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,437
Don't know? 'First mark'.

709
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:37,113
93.5 marks.- First mark?

710
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:38,440
Are you asking ''how did l get it''?

711
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:40,276
Why everybody is asking me
the same question?

712
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,384
You should believe persons
at the first sight.

713
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:44,110
Where there is a will,
there is Margabandhu...

714
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:45,455
There is a way.

715
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:52,785
Okay. l just saw your name, show me.

716
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:57,793
l've known your name.
But l don't know the way.

717
00:43:58,002 --> 00:43:58,969
Tell me the way.

718
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:01,972
Why is she dumb?

719
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:03,806
Silence means acceptance.

720
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:05,641
Groom, you go
straight & turn right.

721
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:07,239
Groom?

722
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,807
Okay, thank you, my girl.

723
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:15,314
She is connecting me with her.
- Hey, good choice.

724
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:23,819
Good morning sir.

725
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:52,355
Good morning sir.

726
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,188
Welcome to SLRM institute
of medical science.

727
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:04,356
l'm Dr.Viswanath, the Dean
of this institution.

728
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:07,029
Please sit down.

729
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:11,704
Hey Vatti, you fool...
<i>- What's it brother?</i>

730
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,706
Did you find only this
college in this city?

731
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:15,208
<i>What're you talking?</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

732
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:18,540
Are you asking me the reason?
Pappu's father is here.

733
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,717
<i>What is he doing there?</i>

734
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:24,718
He's giving a big lecture
in front of the mike.

735
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:35,556
Present elite doctors have
studied in this college only.

736
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:36,729
Now tell me.

737
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:42,899
Who is having great qualities
to become elite doctors?

738
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:43,906
l...

739
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,906
Good, l like your confidence.

740
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:48,237
Hands down please.

741
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:49,245
You...

742
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:52,912
What is your name?- Nimmi.

743
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:55,581
ls it audible?- Yes.

744
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:59,252
Now tell me. What is your
special quality?

745
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,924
Why do you want to become a doctor?
- Humaneness.

746
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:04,093
l didn't get you.

747
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:05,591
'User friendly' in computer,

748
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:06,922
and 'customer friendly' in business.

749
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:09,099
Similarly doctors should
be 'patient friendly'.

750
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:10,998
By realising the pain of patients,

751
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:14,598
Being a doctor, l want to
serve them in a friendly manner.

752
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:17,772
This is not a'Asylum'
to show affection and kindness.

753
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:19,772
This is a hospital.
Please sit down.

754
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:26,112
Well, look at my hand.

755
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:29,782
Till now, l might have done
1000's of operations.

756
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,788
But my hands never shivered.

757
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:33,789
Why?

758
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:36,950
Because l won't love my patients.

759
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:42,792
But tomorrow in case if
l operate my daughter,

760
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,128
who knows on that day,
my hands may shiver.

761
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:47,462
You know why...?

762
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:49,965
Because of that concern & love
which you had mentioned.

763
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:50,970
Feelings.

764
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:56,807
According to us, a patient
is just a body.

765
00:46:57,014 --> 00:47:00,814
Our mind shouldn't think
about his whereabouts or status.

766
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:05,314
You're going to learn only
this in your 5 years of studies.

767
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:07,482
Well, that's it for today.

768
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:08,821
Any other questions.

769
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:10,323
Yes, one question.

770
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:21,661
ln case, if a patient comes
to the hospital with his mouth frothing,

771
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:24,007
will you immediately take
him to the operation theatre,

772
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:26,335
and save him by giving Chloroform.

773
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:30,176
Or will you ask him to fill up
the admission form and let him die?

774
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:37,011
Your classes start tomorrow
at 8 'o' clock sharp. See you.

775
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:39,355
Hello, why're you going away?

776
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:41,355
Like 'Vikramadthiyan and devil',

777
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:44,186
Everyday l'll ask you questions
lying on your shoulder.

778
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:45,861
You've to answer my questions.

779
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:49,688
You've to. You're paid for that only.

780
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:56,372
93.5% V.Rajaraman.

781
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:00,706
Sir, why're you seeing it
through lens?- Why?

782
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:03,539
Figures will be seen big &
you'll get tensed. - Will you shut up?

783
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:07,877
How did he get 93.5%.
How is it possible?

784
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:10,883
Sir, how do l know?
- You're right.

785
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:12,380
How do you know?

786
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:13,385
How do you know?

787
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:14,716
Have you written the exam.?

788
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:17,052
Father, l've a doubt.

789
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:19,395
You showed this man's photo to me
saying ''this is doctor Raja'',

790
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:21,894
and you said that
they will come to see me.

791
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,498
l didn't know that
he is a big fraud.

792
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,567
That's why, l stopped you.
He is a big rowdy.

793
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:29,399
Collection king. He will hold courts.

794
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,908
Not an ordinary one.
But a 'powerful court'.

795
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:36,409
Wait, have you seen him?

796
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:40,081
l've seen him. He asked
me the way.- What?

797
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:45,080
Does he know that
l'm your daughter?- Daddy.

798
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:50,420
No control yourself. Does he know that
you're my daughter?

799
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:53,528
He doesn't know.- Thank god.
Thank god.

800
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:55,925
Sir, shall l tell him that
she's my daughter?- Shut up.

801
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,337
Brother, do you want to
stay in this hostel?

802
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:07,341
College Dean had told me,
let me stay here.

803
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:10,012
They will tell you!
What is the room no?

804
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:11,339
They said 2.

805
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:13,015
Who said?- At the reception.

806
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:14,683
Your lucky number is 7.

807
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:17,012
How come? l've born on 3rd.

808
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,347
lf you minus 3 from 10, - 7.

809
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:20,352
Look, 7 has come.

810
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:23,526
Only we've come here.
- Great teaser!

811
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:27,356
Look, if you minus 7 from 12.
- lt's 5.

812
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:29,361
Add 2 to that.

813
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:30,362
What do you get?

814
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:33,028
Go man...

815
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:35,534
You may say when we minus 20
from 27. We will get 7.

816
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:36,535
Will you deny it?

817
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,709
No.- Hereafter this is
our room. Come on..

818
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:41,035
Brother, come on.

819
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:42,040
Oh god.

820
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:42,878
What happened to you?

821
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:45,540
Lucky number, brother.

822
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:47,216
Then why did you hit it?

823
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:49,385
l had only hit it. Did you?

824
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:51,213
This number is lucky for you,
go inside.

825
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:53,216
What is this man?

826
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:56,392
Hey, where is your room mate?
- Sir, he's in the bath room.

827
00:49:56,593 --> 00:49:58,390
Bath room?- Hey, don't
threaten him too much.

828
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:00,225
Wait a minute.

829
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:03,566
Not only for one minute,
you've to stay there for 5 years.

830
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:07,897
What's this? Such a small room.
- ls it very small?

831
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:10,232
We'll break this wall and take 8,

832
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,067
we'll break this wall and take 6.

833
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:14,072
Let the room number be 678.

834
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:16,745
6, 7, 8...lf we add
them we'll get 21 .

835
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:19,074
lf you add 2 and 1 , you'll get 3.
Your birth date.

836
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:20,579
lf you minus 3 from 10, it's 7.

837
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:22,418
lt's your room number.
- Shut up man.

838
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:23,745
Where have you come from?
- From the bathroom.

839
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:25,417
Finished?- Yes.

840
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:26,418
Okay.

841
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:27,753
Okay now.

842
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:31,917
Who are you?- Wait...

843
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:35,928
l've asked them not to do rowdism here.

844
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:39,262
You're asking 'who am l''?

845
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:40,930
Who are you? Man.
What's your name?

846
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:43,436
Swaminathan sir.
- Okay, sit down.

847
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,607
Sit man.

848
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:49,273
We are all your room mates.

849
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:52,107
What do you mean?
Are they going to stay here?

850
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:53,942
My friends will be with me.

851
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:56,784
They'll stay here for 2 or 5 days,
and they'll go out for one day.

852
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:59,114
lf l call them, they'll come here.
Why're you bothered?

853
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:02,284
Fridge is here. A.C. will come now.

854
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:06,117
You can use my hair oil
perfume, powder etc.

855
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,396
Except my underwear.
l'll also not use yours.

856
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,634
Did you wash your hands
after going to toilet?- Yes.

857
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:14,463
Shake hands Gopinath,
lets become friends.

858
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:15,797
Sir my name is Swaminathan.

859
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,307
Do you know another matter?- Tell me.

860
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:21,640
lf l say something,
you shouldn't deny it. Got it.

861
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:24,075
My name is Swami sir.
What did l tell you now?

862
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:26,215
Call me as you like,
Swami or Gopi?

863
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:31,484
lf my father comes to see me,
can he call me Swami?

864
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:34,320
Shall l change your father's name?

865
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:35,491
Let it be Sambu.- Sit down.

866
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:39,484
Give an inch you take a foot,
do you've a heater in bathroom?

867
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:40,993
Yes, but is under repair.

868
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:42,165
Okay, l'll replace it
with another one.

869
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:45,494
Oh boss.- Couldn't you lock the door?

870
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:49,160
He's a rustic fellow.
- What happened?

871
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:51,499
lt's a western type.
Doesn't suit me.

872
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:54,677
lf l lose the balance...
l'll pass it after going home.

873
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:56,846
Can you manage till such time?
- l think l can.

874
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:01,842
Excuse me what's the procedure
to change the room?

875
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:04,854
First year? Come on...

876
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,023
What do we have to do to
change the room?

877
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:09,192
First you've to change your dress.
Are you ragging?

878
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:10,859
They said there's no
ragging in this college.

879
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,358
We had spread the rumour like that.

880
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:15,190
You come...come dear...

881
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:20,392
l became major in may 98.

882
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:28,939
From that day, l'm restless.

883
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:33,708
Hey come on...
- Please leave me brother.

884
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,145
Why're you feeling shy?

885
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:36,250
Brother, please don't remove my shirt.

886
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:39,445
Hey remove it...
- Please brother.

887
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,146
Why're you troubling Samu?

888
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:42,586
What is happening here?- Ragging.

889
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:43,755
ls it called ragging?

890
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:47,221
Wow! Explain the term 'ragging'.

891
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,861
No sir, he's a first year student,
So we are ragging.

892
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:54,028
Since l don't have sacred
bead around my neck, you didn't rag me.

893
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:55,670
l'm also a first year student.

894
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,702
You rag me too. Come on...

895
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:20,528
He's a versatile doctor.

896
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:26,499
What Sambu? You too come
and join me.

897
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:29,870
What's harm in this?
l'm here. Come on.

898
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:35,433
Hey senior, where're you going?
Go that side.

899
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:41,709
Dance...dance through your eyes.

900
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:47,387
Dance like this...dance.

901
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:50,321
To roam around the town with you,
l'll sit on your back.

902
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:55,157
l'll play 'hide and seek'
by closing your eyes. ls this walk enough?

903
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,034
Do you want more?

904
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:03,733
ls that clear now? Any doubt.

905
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:04,998
Raise your hand.- Why?

906
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:08,033
You're asking 'why' after raising
your hand. You'll become a great doctor.

907
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,212
l've raised the question.

908
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:13,046
l know what all we face after
eating these peanuts.

909
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:15,250
But can we become
brilliant? Tell me.

910
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:23,292
Vikramathiyan is ready to
answer my question.

911
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:24,255
Get out.

912
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:25,687
That can't be an answer.

913
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:29,160
lf this man doesn't
leave the class now.

914
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:33,229
This will be my
last class in this year.

915
00:54:33,803 --> 00:54:37,239
Raja, please go out.

916
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:39,066
Okay...okay...

917
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:44,544
Sambu, listen carefully what sir
says note it down & tell me in detail.

918
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:47,315
l'll learn without a
teacher like Ekaleevan.

919
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:49,917
No, Ekalaivan.- Something
like that. Give way.

920
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:55,820
l'll go now and come tomorrow.

921
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:57,955
You take this along
with your girl friend.

922
00:54:58,228 --> 00:54:59,354
Respect for love.

923
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,726
Sir, what's the procedure for
changing the room?

924
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:06,263
Shut up and sit down.

925
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:11,063
Hello Vatti...<i>- Brother.</i>

926
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:13,208
World war has started
between me and the Dean.

927
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:14,172
Hello....- Hello.

928
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:16,674
l didn't say 'hello' to you.
l said to someone else.

929
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:19,975
He shot an arrow on me.
l shot it back.

930
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:22,741
His arrows missed the mark. Students
laughed at him.

931
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:25,853
He stood there
armless and crestfallen.

932
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:28,490
<i>Was he not dressed?</i>
- He was fully dressed.

933
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:32,594
<i>You said he wasn't dressed.</i>
- No not that.

934
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:33,728
Armless means without weapons.

935
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,626
<i>ln what language?</i>
- Assume any language. Leave it man.

936
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:38,834
Ask me what l did?
<i>- What did you do?</i>

937
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:42,596
l left the classroom.
Others shouldn't get disturbed.

938
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:45,104
Thank god! Pappu isn't working here.

939
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:47,503
Otherwise she would've
been terribly upset.

940
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:51,807
Mr, what're you talking
about Pappu?

941
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:52,481
Just a minute.

942
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:53,441
Lollipop.

943
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:55,351
Why're you shouting?

944
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:57,747
Why? Will everyone ask for it?

945
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:01,589
What 'ish'? l'll shout.
This is my college.

946
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,759
More than that, this is my
father-in-law's college.

947
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,053
Wait, l've a wedge(aapu) for you.

948
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,391
No....you said 'pappu'...

949
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:10,122
No, l said, l've a 'aapu' for you.

950
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:11,766
lt doesn't mean Pappu
will be my concubine?

951
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,966
This Pappu and Dean are one.

952
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:18,800
Why? What did Pappu do?
- How can l explain to you in brief?

953
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:24,872
Assume you're Pappu. l'm there.
We both are engaged. Don't feel shy.

954
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:26,013
l didn't feel shy, carry on.

955
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:30,141
But if this marriage is performed,
your life will be ruined.- Why?

956
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:31,650
She will come to know that
l'm a 'collectionist'.

957
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:32,745
What?

958
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:37,392
lt's like terrorist, typist cyclist etc.
You listen to my story. What l do is..

959
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:43,362
l'll phone you & ask you to reject me,
when l come to see you. Understood?

960
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,761
Yes, you said it earlier 'armless'.

961
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:50,595
That means without weapons. This is
rejection. - Oh okay. Listen to my story.

962
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:52,502
You'll think that our next scene
will be bride-seeing function.

963
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,802
No, there will be a
twist in the screenplay.

964
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,740
You'll tell this to Dean.

965
00:56:57,947 --> 00:57:00,745
Then he will talk,
to my father insultingly.

966
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,975
My parents are shell shocked
by the insult heaped on them.

967
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:04,346
Now comes the interval.

968
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:06,245
Then what?

969
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:08,320
Then go and have a drink.
Sorry friend.

970
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:10,349
l'm narrating my entire
story to her.

971
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,026
<i>Who is she?</i>

972
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:13,718
She has again covered it
with her hands.

973
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:14,419
Janaki.

974
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:15,353
Bye.

975
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:16,827
<i>Then?</i>
- What then?

976
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:18,200
<i>Narrate the entire story.</i>

977
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:21,370
He's also asking the same thing. He has
listened to it earlier also. Repeat audience.

978
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:22,469
Shall l start from the beginning?

979
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:26,538
l and Pappu are childhood friends.
We used to play together.

980
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:30,939
<i>This is the theory</i>
<i>class of this session.</i>

981
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:35,012
<i>We make an incision on the skin</i>
<i>at the centre of the body.</i>

982
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:37,277
<i>The outer layer of</i>
<i>the skin is called...</i>

983
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,846
<i>Epidemus...- Very good.</i>

984
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,051
<i>Once we peel off the skin.</i>

985
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:41,951
<i>We'll be able to</i>
<i>see the muscle layer.</i>

986
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:43,225
What?

987
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:44,787
l'm trying to see.

988
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:46,222
What're you seeing?- Body.

989
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,798
lt isn't stomach for you doctor.
lt is abdominal cavity.

990
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:54,932
Hey Sambu...

991
00:57:55,738 --> 00:57:59,936
What 'ish'? Being a vegetarian
you're standing first.

992
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:03,306
Uncleaned fish cart
is better than this. This dead body..

993
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,174
Don't call it a dead body
call it cadaver.

994
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:09,009
Patients are struggling
for their lives.

995
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:10,650
Here you're tinkering with the body.

996
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:11,513
What do you want?

997
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:13,746
Why're you tinkering?

998
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:15,515
This's the destruction
of the abdominal cavity.

999
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:18,558
How do you know it?
- How will l? They're all covering.

1000
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:21,992
Shouldn't l see the body?
- lf you want, bring a fresh body.

1001
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:23,130
Really?

1002
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:30,062
l want a body urgently.

1003
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:31,240
What size?

1004
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,375
l didn't want a bodice.
l wanted a body.

1005
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:38,375
They'll do research on a body
in the hospital, isn't it?- ls it?

1006
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:42,711
l want a young one, not an
over ripe one, okay?

1007
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:46,351
Come on...l need some photographs.

1008
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:48,547
Brother, l've got a body.

1009
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:51,554
lmported one.- lmported means?

1010
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:53,153
Made in Japan.

1011
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:54,955
Let it be anything.
lt shouldn't be smelly.

1012
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:57,663
Japanese don't have a nose.
Then, how'll they smell?

1013
00:58:58,067 --> 00:58:59,625
They don't have a nose,
but l have, right?

No house. All stay inside the sacks.

1019
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:28,396
You want to take photo?- Yes.

1020
00:59:29,098 --> 00:59:29,723
Wait.

1021
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:35,136
You go inside his house.
Go inside the sack, then take photos.

1022
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:37,165
Hey hold him tightly trap him.

1023
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:52,087

Hey come.

Collection king,
l've brought a body.

1026
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:01,420
Recent body.- ls it? Really.

1027
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:04,026
Look, our personal body has come.

1028
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:06,593
He is very heavy.

1029
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:07,701
Dead body will be heavy.

1030
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:11,507
Look at the body. He coughs...

1031
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,005
Oh god! What's this?

1032
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:15,906
Hey you cheat...

1033
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:19,045
Stop...Stop everybody.

1034
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:21,148
l need poor lndia photograph.

1035
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:32,424
Sir, how many times do
l've to tell you?

1036
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,119
l'm not at fault.

1037
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:36,456
l did what they told me.
Did you tell me or not?

1038
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:38,998
l said, all of them
are covering the body.

1039
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:40,931
He asked me to
bring a personal body.

1040
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:42,967
l brought the body
in order to learn.

1041
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:45,504
Good, l appreciate
your interest on learning.

1042
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:47,808
l'll teach you. Please come.

1043
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:51,580
This way.

1044
01:00:56,319 --> 01:01:03,691
Lungs, heart and chest...
- Then Kidney, Operate them.

1045
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:05,653
Operate?- Do it.

1046
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:16,938
Not like that.

1047
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:18,297
This is an operation.

1048
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:23,042
You should hold it like a
pencil and do it smoothly.

1049
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:48,135
Admit him.

1050
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:52,738
After he gets consciousness, tell him
that l had filled up his form.- Okay sir.

1051
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,744
l came to the class without
having breakfast.

1052
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,046
l didn't sleep last night.

1053
01:01:57,246 --> 01:01:59,646
They had washed the mosaic floor.

1054
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:04,786
l slipped and fell down.
l thought of taking rest here. What is it?

1055
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:07,748
Why all are laughing?
Am l lying?

1056
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:11,290
Why are you laughing?
Who are you? l've seen you some where.

1057
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:13,661
Why're you digging the past?

1058
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:15,528
ls it you?

1059
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:19,101
Do you remember him?
l got it. 'Operation'...

1060
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:21,896
Have you become alright?
- Now l'm alright.

1061
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:24,703
What're you talking man?

1062
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:30,577
l'll become alright some day.- ls it?
How're you now? - l'm not a patient.

1063
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:37,275
How are you?- l'm fine.
What about your son?

1064
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:38,721
What do you want me to say?

1065
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:42,115
Stupid son. He again took
phenol in the hospital.

1066
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:45,355
Hey how many times you'll vomit?

1067
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:48,525
First, you shouldn't beat young men.

1068
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:51,291
lf they fail in their exams,
they will take foildol.

1069
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:53,694
Are we not humans?

1070
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:57,230
Hey, don't beat him. His phenol
may come out.

1071
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:58,570
Move away.

1072
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:04,772
Brother, the mouth isn't the place
for this to be poured in.

1073
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:08,341
When you breathe, you'll get
that smell. Can you sleep peacefully?

1074
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:10,348
lf someone mistakes you
for a toilet, then what?

1075
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:12,880
Who knows my hardship?

1076
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,088
You're talking philosophy in anger.

1077
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:18,620
Love failure?

1078
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:19,624
What love?

1079
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:22,696
Wait, in your days
you had no such facility.

1080
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:24,059
You married as per
your father's wish.

1081
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,790
He loved a girl, right?

1082
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:26,898
This is...

1083
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:30,930
She will come in his dreams.
He'll smile at her.

1084
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:36,237
But who will come in her dreams?

1085
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:38,743
You've turned a happy
song into a sad one.

1086
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:41,039
What is one side love?

1087
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:42,681
Are you crying for that?

1088
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:46,147
Okay cry, if you don't
cry, who will cry for you?

1089
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:48,755
lf you practice crying,
You should cry for others also.

1090
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:49,982
You'll think like that.

1091
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:52,559
Do you know about
'Embrace Therapy'?- No.- Don't know?

1092
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:53,421
Come here.

1093
01:03:54,363 --> 01:03:54,829
This is that.

1094

1109

1115
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:14,469

01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:18,098

Congrats?- Why? For that song?

1150

How was my dance?
Did you like the lyrics?

1151
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:23,825
lt's not for that. l'm thanking you
for that suicide case.

1152

Suicide? ls this a police station.

He has a name.
- Sorry Nelakandan.

- lt will be there only.

1155

l'm sure he's going to be alright.

1156
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:35,667
That's why, l came to
shake hands with you.

1157
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:37,668
You had already done it, it's alright.

1158
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:41,009
But it seems you've come
here with a plan.

1159
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:42,177
l don't think you've
come here to study.

1160
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:44,171
No l haven't come to study.

1161
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:45,347
l've come to teach a lesson,

1162
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:47,015
to Dean and his daughter.

1163
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:49,681
Look, don't include Pappu in your
crusade unnecessarily.

1164
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:51,349
Why're you getting tensed?

1165
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,848
That day l had asked you to
assume that you're Pappu.

1166
01:09:55,057 --> 01:09:56,854
But now you're talking to me
as real Pappu?

1167
01:09:57,226 --> 01:09:58,523
Why're you concerned about her?

1168
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:00,524
Listen, Pappu isn't wrong.

1169
01:10:00,729 --> 01:10:02,026
lnfact she doesn't know anything.

1170
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:03,698
My neck is paining.
You please come this side.

1171
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:09,863
Pappu and l are close friends.

1172
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:11,369
Closer than me?

1173
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:13,371
Are you very close to her?

1174
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:15,874
Have you seen Pappu with
her inner garments?- What?

1175
01:10:16,078 --> 01:10:18,706
l've seen her.
- Shit, where and when?

1176
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:20,879
ln my young age
when she was a baby.

1177
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:22,209
She was very beautiful.

1178
01:10:22,585 --> 01:10:25,554
Now she would've grown up
and hidden all her beauty.

1179
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:27,381
Now how does she look now?

1180
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:30,054
You don't even known how she looks.

1181
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:31,385
And you're casting aspersions on her.

1182
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:33,892
Actually Pappu hadn't
complained about you to the Dean.

1183
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:35,063
lt was her servant maid.

1184
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:38,066
Why Dean should believe
that servant maid's words?

1185
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:41,065
Madam leave aside Pappu's matter.

1186
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:44,065
Tell me how does that servant
maid look.- Why?

1187
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,408
l think Dean has something
to do with the maid.

1188
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:51,075
lmmediately you make
arrangements to meet Pappu.

1189
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,077
Oh god! Dean will not spare her.

1190
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:56,244
Okay, you study well
without disturbing anyone,

1191
01:10:56,619 --> 01:11:01,079
l'll see that you and Pappu meet.
- Promise?- Promise.

1192
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:08,930
Have a look at this case.
This is an interesting case.

1193
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:13,427
This case is a rare
phenomenon in medical history.

1194
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:17,598
For the past 12 years,
this has remained like this only.

1195
01:11:17,973 --> 01:11:21,932
This can't talk, hear or feel anything.

1196
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:23,771
lts feelings are dead.

1197
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:29,107
But subject is still alive.
Now look at me carefully.

1198
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:33,777
When l beam the torch light,
pupil will have movement.

1199
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:36,787
But eyelids won't close.

1200
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:41,125
Master, it's enough. Switch off
the torch. His eyes may be dazzled.

1201
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:42,964
Subject can't feel anything.

1202
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:45,133
ls this history or geography subjects?
You're calling him as a subject!

1203
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:46,801
Doesn't he have a name?
What's his a name?

1204
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:49,304
Good, just now you're
looking at his name?

1205
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:50,301
What is his name?

1206
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:56,471
Case name is Anand.- Don't call
him a case. Call him Mr.Anand.

1207
01:11:56,679 --> 01:11:57,646
What's wrong in that?

1208
01:11:57,846 --> 01:11:59,473
lf we give respect, will it know?

1209
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:03,482
From the beginning l'm watching you,
you're talking against me.

1210
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:04,983
Am l a student or you?

1211
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:06,317
Raja, keep quiet.

1212
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:08,152
Why're you getting emotional now?

1213
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:09,324
lf l don't get emotional,

1214
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:10,492
you may call me also a subject,

1215
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:13,321
and start showing torch light
in my eyes.

1216
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:17,158
Okay, l personally feel,

1217
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:22,994
that medication isn't necessary
for the survival of such persons. - Why?

1218
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:24,498
You know that very well,

1219
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:28,666
we don't have adequate medical facilities
or hospitals in our country.

1220
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:34,508
ls it necessary for him to occupy
the same bed for the past 12 years without hope?

1221
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:36,510
What is the use?

1222
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:40,184
He is useful for the study of this class.
ls it not a use?

1223
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:41,515
One question sir.

1224
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:42,853
Do you want me to ask 5 questions?

1225
01:12:44,393 --> 01:12:45,690
Sir, questions no: 2

1226
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:49,026
How can you be sure that this person
can't get up from his seat?

1227
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:52,530
l'm a doctor.
- Just a doctor, not god.

1228
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,202
The one who doesn't know to
respect his fellow human being,

1229
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:57,861
can't be a human, doctor or even god.

1230
01:12:58,073 --> 01:13:00,200
Sambu, don't you know
''love is Vishnu''.

1231
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:01,706
ls it not ''love is Shivam''?

1232
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:04,371
We had said it already, right?
l just tried a new expression.

1233
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:08,038
Rajaraman, will you please get out?
- Oh really?

1234
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:10,544
Then 3rd question for you.

1235
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:14,553
When l leave the class, can l take
Mr.Anand along with me?- No way.

1236
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:16,891
Then answer my 2th question.

1237
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:21,722
What'll you do, if l take him
without your permission?- Shit.

1238
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:23,397
He had given a right
answer for this alone.

1239
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:24,395
You carry on with that.

1240
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:25,567
l'll go for a walk.- No.

1241
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:27,565
l'll ask you the 5th question later.

1242
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:29,897
Raja, what're you doing?
- Move away...

1243
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:39,570
Mr.Anand, don't worry.
Doctors consider themselves god.

1244
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:41,079
You don't believe them.

1245
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:43,751
You can believe an atheist.

1246
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:46,079
You can even believe a theist.

1247
01:13:46,288 --> 01:13:48,756
But don't believe those who
consider themselves as god.

1248
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:49,924
You will be ruined.

1249
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:52,757
lf anyone troubles you, tell me.

1250
01:13:52,961 --> 01:13:55,930
Oh you can't say, right?
You just think.

1251
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:57,598
l'll read your mind.

1252
01:13:57,966 --> 01:14:01,094
Good persons can read minds.
Do you know?

1253
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:05,440
Hey...Anand...

1254
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:08,106
When l was bringing you,
should this have happened?

1255
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:10,938
Madam, give me.
- Hey, what're you doing?

1256
01:14:11,146 --> 01:14:12,272
l'm checking whether
he's alive.

1257
01:14:12,481 --> 01:14:13,948
When l was bringing him,
his head fell.

1258
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:19,442
Okay madam, everything
is functioning well.

1259
01:14:21,824 --> 01:14:23,121
lt should.

1260
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:25,452
Okay, Mr.Anand, do you want
to hear your heart beat?

1261
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:29,620
Oh god! l couldn't see his ear.
- He can hear and see.

1262
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:32,797
lt seems she is a Tamil
teacher giving a lecture.

1263
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:35,800
1 , 2, 3 mike testing...
Can you hear?

1264
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:44,973
How is your heart?
You are 100% alive.

1265
01:14:45,347 --> 01:14:47,975
No 200% adding my age to it.

1266
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:51,979
Till l'm here, you'll not face
any problem. You'll be healthy.

1267
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:56,146
No one can...what's this, it got stuck.
Have it...- lt's okay.

1268
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:57,484
Wait for 5 minutes.

1269
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:02,826
Hello, Vatti....

1270
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:06,501
He took the subject out of the class.

1271
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:08,666
He twisted Dr.Kalidhas's hand,

1272
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:09,667
without even filling the admission form,

1273
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:11,339
he made him to admit a suicide case.

1274
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:12,336
He went on leave, getting scared.

1275
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:15,510
What is this Margabandhu?
- How do l Know sir?

1276
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:17,679
You've an answer for everything.
''How do l know''.

1277
01:15:18,714 --> 01:15:19,510
But you're right. How do you know?

1278
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:22,183
Sir, forget it. He's using
lot of bad words.

1279
01:15:22,384 --> 01:15:25,353
Rascal, rogue, scoundrel...
- What else?- Wastrel...

1280
01:15:26,054 --> 01:15:26,850
Yes sir.

1281
01:15:27,055 --> 01:15:29,853
Hey move away....
move...give way.

1282
01:15:30,225 --> 01:15:31,522
Sir, we should first dismiss him.

1283
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:33,186
Just a minute.

1284
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:34,862
That won't be possible.
That is wrong.

1285
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:37,531
Why?- What why?

1286
01:15:37,733 --> 01:15:38,700
What is your reason?

1287
01:15:38,901 --> 01:15:41,369
ls it because he's asking you questions?
Or talking vulgarly?

1288
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:43,037
He has come first
in the entrance exam.

1289
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:45,373
You should have a strong
reason to dismiss him.

1290
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:50,374
Yes, l've got an idea.

1291
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:53,548
Margabandhu, prepare a
tough question paper.

1292
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:57,708
l'll set questions from ancient
Tamil poems. Definitely he'll fail.

1293
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,547
l'm serious. l'm not joking.

1294
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:02,386
Prepare a question paper in such
a way that no one should answer it.

1295
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:05,052
He can't answer. He will fail.

1296
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:08,396
l'll dismiss him the next minute.
- Great idea.

1297
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:13,223
Leader, collection king's men are
bringing a cot, what to do?

1298
01:16:13,435 --> 01:16:14,402
What language are you talking?

1299
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:17,231
Sorry sir, collection king's men
are bringing a cot,

1300
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:18,406
where can l place it?

1301
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:27,575
Don't keep the head closer.
He may look like having 3 heads.

1302
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:29,450
Move aside...

1303
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:32,413
What have you in your mind?

1304
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:35,423
l think a lot in my mind.

1305
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:36,591
l'm going to become a doctor, right?

1306
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:37,759
What do you want? Tell me.

1307
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:40,258
You're violating hospital rules.

1308
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:42,931
Please translate it in Tamil.

1309
01:16:43,131 --> 01:16:46,259
Look, l can hand you over
to the police now.

1310
01:16:47,135 --> 01:16:50,434
Look, my father-in-law is
sending me to jail.

1311
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:51,932
Okay Rajaram, listen...

1312
01:16:52,474 --> 01:16:53,600
Why've you bought this
cot and bed here?

1313
01:16:53,809 --> 01:16:54,935
He is the reason for that.

1314
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:57,270
He said that l can't
provide him bed.

1315
01:16:57,479 --> 01:16:59,208
l got this bed in auction.

1316
01:16:59,414 --> 01:17:02,781
Mr.Anand don't worry. You can lie
down here for as many days as you wish.

1317
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:07,115
You just enjoy man.
Take photo.

1318
01:17:14,496 --> 01:17:15,793
Did you take his smiling face?

1319
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:17,461
Oh no! l missed him.

1320
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:19,964
Okay, hereafter he'll be
smiling throughout the day.

1321
01:17:25,507 --> 01:17:28,635
Hey, be careful. He hasn't cut
his hair for the past 10 years.

1322
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:30,311
Don't be careless
since he is in comma.

1323
01:17:30,679 --> 01:17:32,146
Anand don't get scared.

1324
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:35,306
l'll cut your hair carefully
and make you the hero.

1325
01:17:35,517 --> 01:17:37,144
Daily l'll take you for a walk.

1326
01:17:37,352 --> 01:17:41,311
lf you see the sun light
you'll become alright.

1327
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:42,657
Do you hear me?
- Haven't you heard the song?

1328
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:44,485
''Mother who embraces
with her 1000 hands'',

1329
01:17:44,693 --> 01:17:46,320
''l offer my salutations''.

1330
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:48,325
We've lots of vitamins in that.

1331
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:51,996
ls it 'B'? - No, 'T'.

1332
01:17:52,534 --> 01:17:55,662
You useless fellow, go man.
- You're calling him like that.

1333
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:57,668
But one person is saying
that you're a useless fellow.

1334
01:17:57,873 --> 01:17:59,500
Who is he?
- Sulam Zamamani.

1335
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:01,168
He's saying ''if you want to
collect money, come to me''.

1336
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:02,172
''There no use of depending
on collection king''.

1337
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:03,844
''He has gone to college''.

1338
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:06,173
He has trapped all our
bank customers.- ls it?

1339
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:07,348
Yes brother, let's go.

1340
01:18:07,549 --> 01:18:10,279
Why're you stopping
your work half way?

1341
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:11,179
Do it man.

1342
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:12,345
Let him be good.

1343
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:13,851
We've come to study
concentrate on studies.

1344
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:15,182
Can we do both the jobs together?

1345
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:17,017
Oh no!- why're you getting upset?

1346
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:19,019
ls it so easy to become a doctor?

1347
01:18:19,561 --> 01:18:21,085
Do you know how many bones
are there in our body?

1348
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:22,523
216 bones.

1349
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:25,700
You know only to break them.
Have we ever counted them?

1350
01:18:25,901 --> 01:18:28,028
What's it brother?
We have counted them many times.

1351
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:29,533
l didn't mean that.

1352
01:18:29,738 --> 01:18:31,365
l mean have we ever
thought like wise men?

1353
01:18:31,573 --> 01:18:33,200
Nowadays, he's talking
too much.- What?

1354
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:35,376
l mean to say that
he has long hair.

1355
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:36,544
That's why l had asked him to cut it.

1356
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:44,211
You've heard about students
bunking their classes.

1357
01:18:44,419 --> 01:18:46,387
Have you heard of a master
misbehaving with students?

1358
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:49,553
Dean always misbehaves with me.

1359
01:18:49,925 --> 01:18:51,722
Give respect to him.
- Why should he be respected?

1360
01:18:51,927 --> 01:18:53,326
You should respect everyone.

1361
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:54,620
Can l tell you one thing?- Tell me.

1362
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:57,560
Everyone in our management dislikes you.
- You too?

1363
01:18:57,766 --> 01:18:58,232
Brother.

1364
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:00,226
You come and have a look.

1365
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:02,903
l'm talking to you...Raja...

1366
01:19:04,106 --> 01:19:06,404
Wow! Anand.

1367
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:12,413
You had hidden your beautiful face
for such a long time.

1368
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:15,579
lf nurses see you, they'll say
''Hereafter don't call me sister''.

1369
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:18,912
''our hearts may break''.
- Lets go for a walk.

1370
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,258
Look at him nicely.

1371
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:31,262
Sister have you seen him?
He looks smart.

1372
01:19:33,135 --> 01:19:35,433
Did you see him?
- lt's all fine?

1373
01:19:35,804 --> 01:19:40,104
But that Dean and his friends
have set a tough question paper.

1374
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:43,106
They're planning to sack you.

1375
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:46,447
lf you pass in this examination,
l'll definitely take you to Pappu.

1376
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:50,106
Look l'm tensed about
my meeting with Pappu.

1377
01:19:50,919 --> 01:19:52,181
But not to pass.

1378
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:57,114
<i>He knows Siddarath.</i>
<i>He knows the tricks.</i>

1379
01:19:57,325 --> 01:20:00,954
<i>He knows to read pulses.</i>
<i>He knows to count crores.</i>

1380
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:19,146
<i>He's a versatile doctor.</i>

1381
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:24,144
Are you upset?- No? Why?

1382
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:25,977
You're worried...

1383
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:27,150
after seeing the paper.

1384
01:20:27,355 --> 01:20:29,585
Yes sir, did you see the paper?

1385
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:33,485
ln vanthavasi, 7 from same family
are hacked in clash among them.

1386
01:20:33,695 --> 01:20:37,153
But Kuppama adjusted
it in Kanchepuram.

1387
01:20:37,365 --> 01:20:39,162
She gave birth to 7
children in her 1st delivery.

1388
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:40,391
What can you understand from this?

1389
01:20:40,602 --> 01:20:43,503
You can defeat god and population.

1390
01:20:43,705 --> 01:20:44,501
What're you looking at?

1391
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:49,837
Haven't you seen the paper?
Only English paper?

1392
01:20:50,712 --> 01:20:52,839
Why're you talking about Hindu etc.

1393
01:20:53,315 --> 01:20:54,077
Are you in the examination hall,

1394
01:20:54,282 --> 01:20:56,341
or in the tea stall?
Hey keep quiet man.

1395
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:59,516
What should l tick for the 5th question?

1396
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:02,849
You should tick...hey...5C.

1397
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:05,518
Okay next...

1398
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:11,529
6 orders of god. 6B?

1399
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:16,359
That's all. Over. You fold the paper.
- Thank you.

1400
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:23,536
Have you finished?- Yes.

1401
01:21:23,745 --> 01:21:26,043
So quick?
- Yes, l'll give it to you.

1402
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:28,043
lt's a tough paper.
That's why l asked.

1403
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:31,711
Educated people will
be respected everywhere.

1404
01:21:41,763 --> 01:21:43,060
lf rowdies become doctors,

1405
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:44,898
then think about the atmosphere
of the hospital.

1406
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:46,666
How will they talk?

1407
01:21:47,602 --> 01:21:49,570
''You do post mortem on that bastard''.

1408
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:51,729
''That scoundrel is out of danger''.

1409
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:54,241
''Buddy, you'll die''.

1410
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:56,577
How nice to hear all these words!

1411
01:21:56,945 --> 01:21:59,072
l know about suitcases,
what is this broken case?

1412
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:00,748
Sir, it may be a
suitcase with a lock.

1413
01:22:00,949 --> 01:22:01,745
Hey keep quiet man.

1414
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:05,078
Didn't l ask you to prepare
a tough question paper?

1415
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:07,585
l prepared it.
- Then how can he get 95.5%

1416
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:09,917
lf l block a coin,

1417
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:12,650
he's some how pocketing that coin.

1418
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:14,920
Sir don't talk about carrom.

1419
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:17,098
Okay how can he get a top score?

1420
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:21,925
How do l know that sir?
- l'm sorry. How would you know?

1421
01:22:26,808 --> 01:22:27,604
May l come in sir?

1422
01:22:28,143 --> 01:22:30,111
Sir, you asked me to
call Rajaram, he's...

1423
01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:32,440
We'll deal with the matter.

1424
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:43,521
l'm the Dean, l'm standing.

1425
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:46,457
Yes, lt seems you'll
get vericose veins.

1426
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:48,128
Just now your men
taught me this.

1427
01:22:48,496 --> 01:22:49,121
Don't stand for a
long time, sit down.

1428
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:50,623
Are you teaching me?

1429
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:53,130
You're sitting without giving respect?
What's this bad habit?

1430
01:22:53,835 --> 01:22:55,132
You had only taught me.

1431
01:22:55,337 --> 01:22:59,637
ln the classroom you're teaching us
standing. l'm your follower.

1432
01:23:00,442 --> 01:23:01,534
Talking logic!

1433
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:04,475
But there's no logic in your
marks which you've scored.

1434
01:23:05,013 --> 01:23:07,811
You've done something.
l know that very well.

1435
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:12,810
l'll definitely find out.
- Why do you take the trouble?

1436
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:14,488
l'll tell you openly.

1437
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:17,658
l cheated and passed in the exam.

1438
01:23:17,859 --> 01:23:20,987
l'll continue it even in future.
This is the situation today.

1439
01:23:27,702 --> 01:23:28,498
Shut up!

1440
01:23:29,037 --> 01:23:31,164
Hey why're you laughing
like a mad man?

1441
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:33,668
Whom are you calling
''A mad man''?

1442
01:23:35,043 --> 01:23:36,670
l told all of us.
l too laughed.

1443
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:39,506
We've become close now, right?
- Shut up.

1444
01:23:40,715 --> 01:23:42,683
No one has ever talked
like this to me.

1445
01:23:43,218 --> 01:23:45,015
Mammu, there's should be
a beginning for everything.

1446
01:23:46,388 --> 01:23:49,357
What is this Mammu?
- l'll tell you the meaning.

1447
01:23:50,392 --> 01:23:53,020
My name is Raja.
l can be called 'Raju'.

1448
01:23:53,228 --> 01:23:55,526
So, father-in-law can be
called 'Mammu'.

1449
01:23:55,897 --> 01:23:56,693
That's all.

1450
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:00,367
Cool down.

1451
01:24:01,403 --> 01:24:03,132
What? - l thought you had called me.

1452
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,537
You don't know about me.

1453
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:09,043
lf l want l can throw
you out of the college.

1454
01:24:09,744 --> 01:24:12,212
Do you remember the day
l drove you out of my house?

1455
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:15,876
l can't forget that day...

1456
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:20,551
l saw my father shedding tears.
l have never seen him crying.

1457
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:24,384
Even when my grand father died,
he didn't cry & stood like a rock.

1458
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:28,621
By your single revelation,
he started shedding tears.

1459
01:24:32,434 --> 01:24:33,731
l've to become a doctor,

1460
01:24:35,103 --> 01:24:37,401
and put a rivet on you.

1461
01:24:38,773 --> 01:24:45,406
My rivet, rivet then nails.
You can leaver them out.

1462
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:48,644
Next l should marry
your daughter Pappu.

1463
01:24:49,117 --> 01:24:49,742
You laugh...

1464
01:24:50,351 --> 01:24:52,080
Next l should arrange
your pyre.

1465
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:56,087
Sorry l've said it in a
local language.

1466
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:57,588
l'll arrange for a stretcher for you.

1467
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:02,426
l know what you're going to say.
You'll say 'get out'.

1468
01:25:02,964 --> 01:25:05,558
lf l go out by your order,
that will be an insult for me.

1469
01:25:05,967 --> 01:25:07,434
l've some work. l'll take leave.

1470
01:25:07,635 --> 01:25:08,602
You keep on smiling.

1471
01:25:08,803 --> 01:25:10,930
l've an urgent work.
Ask me 'what's it'?

1472
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:13,436
Won't you ask me?
l will tell you.

1473
01:25:19,881 --> 01:25:21,712
Congrats...you've got a promotion.

1474
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:23,879
How did you get the
phone call from my office?

1475
01:25:24,652 --> 01:25:25,812
l meant, you're going
to become a father.

1476
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:27,044
How does my office know it?

1477
01:25:27,255 --> 01:25:30,383
Always office...hug your
wife and be happy man.

1478
01:25:30,592 --> 01:25:31,889
Not here, at home.

1479
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:35,227
When did you come?

1480
01:25:35,497 --> 01:25:37,465
l came while you were
congratulating him.

1481
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:38,222
Wish me too.

1482
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:40,232
You too? Get lost.

1483
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:40,992
No...?

1484
01:25:42,103 --> 01:25:43,570
You said pregnant women
will get 'Pappa' (baby)

1485
01:25:44,172 --> 01:25:46,003
You said if l pass,
Pappu will come to meet me.

1486
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:47,098
l don't get you.

1487
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:49,674
Why're you walking away?
- l have work.

1488
01:25:50,278 --> 01:25:54,009
You said that you'll help me
meet Pappu if l pass.

1489
01:25:54,215 --> 01:25:56,012
Pappu is ready to meet you.

1490
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:58,647
But when l think of her father...

1491
01:25:59,621 --> 01:26:02,089
What's that Laugh theraphy
for reducing tension?

1492
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:04,582
Can one get sound sleep
if he yawns?

1493
01:26:05,126 --> 01:26:06,753
Even l've not completed
my doctor's degree,

1494
01:26:06,961 --> 01:26:08,929
l can prescribe
correctly for few cases.

1495
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:10,925
Laughing theraphy will
not work for him.

1496
01:26:11,132 --> 01:26:11,996
Embracing theraphy will.

1497
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:15,959
Ask Pappu to embrace
her father fondly daily.

1498
01:26:16,471 --> 01:26:17,597
Wait and see. His tension
will definitely reduce.

1499
01:26:17,805 --> 01:26:19,636
That's embracing theraphy.
- Embracing theraphy?

1500
01:26:19,974 --> 01:26:24,274
Won't they say that
hands that beat will also hug?

1501
01:26:26,314 --> 01:26:27,713
Ask me about rowdism?

1502
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:30,441
l've spent half of my
life in rowdism.

1503
01:26:30,652 --> 01:26:32,950
Now l regret it.

1504
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:36,123
lf we clasp hands with
the hitter and hug him,

1505
01:26:36,658 --> 01:26:37,784
relations will become cordial.

1506
01:26:38,326 --> 01:26:39,224
That's embracing theraphy.

1507
01:26:39,427 --> 01:26:42,954
Can't they move away
seeing me swabbing?

1508
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:45,963
He's always like that.

1509
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:49,331
Look how you're laughing
without tension.

1510
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:52,806
lf you were angry l would've given you
embracing theraphy,

1511
01:26:53,007 --> 01:26:54,406
and Pappu would've felt jealous,

1512
01:26:54,943 --> 01:26:56,171
and there is something which
comes between lovers, what's it?

1513
01:26:56,844 --> 01:26:57,970
Villain?- No...

1514
01:26:58,613 --> 01:27:01,241
After getting very close
to each other..- Baby?

1515
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:04,576
Oh god you...that's
a jolly tension.

1516
01:27:05,353 --> 01:27:07,651
Love?.- Yes, that's it.

1517
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:10,320
Hey, do you take yourself
to be lord Krishna.

1518
01:27:11,192 --> 01:27:15,424
l'm swabbing the floor & you're
walking on itleaving your foot marks.

1519
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:17,723
l'm going on an important work.

1520
01:27:18,032 --> 01:27:20,193
Nobody has brains.

1521
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:22,266
Why's he getting
tensed at this age?

1522
01:27:23,638 --> 01:27:24,935
Wait for 5 minutes.

1523
01:27:27,709 --> 01:27:34,842
l'm swabbing...l'm telling them
not to dirty the floor.

1524
01:27:36,884 --> 01:27:39,512
Do l've to tell you specially?

1525
01:27:39,887 --> 01:27:42,014
Why're you troubling me like this?

1526
01:27:42,223 --> 01:27:43,781
You'll walk away leaving your foot marks.

1527
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:47,189
Higher officials will shout at me
saying that l didn't swab it clean.

1528
01:27:47,428 --> 01:27:51,524
Your name?- Why? Going to complain
against me? Do it?

1529
01:27:51,733 --> 01:27:52,700
l'm Punniakodi.

1530
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:55,198
The result of your work
is in your name, you know?

1531
01:27:55,403 --> 01:27:56,199
What do you mean?

1532
01:27:56,404 --> 01:27:56,870
DEED.

1533
01:27:57,272 --> 01:28:01,231
Doctors treat diseases, taking money.

1534
01:28:01,442 --> 01:28:06,846
But you're preventing the diseases by
swabbing the floor with Phenol.

1535
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:07,877
That's service.

1536
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:11,711
l'm doing that for 20 Yrs.
- That's different.

1537
01:28:11,919 --> 01:28:16,049
What l mean is...Social service, like the
freedom fighters did to the nation.

1538
01:28:16,257 --> 01:28:17,383
Me?- Then?

1539
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:20,060
Bigwigs don't find time
to appreciate all this.

1540
01:28:20,361 --> 01:28:23,524
We've to find some time to appreciate.

1541
01:28:34,942 --> 01:28:38,070
There will no Cholera outbreak if there's
a person like you in every street?

1542
01:28:38,713 --> 01:28:41,181
But you talk too much! You'll
shout at everything.

1543
01:28:41,783 --> 01:28:42,772
Yet you've a good heart.

1544
01:28:43,551 --> 01:28:44,518
There may be many people outside.

1545
01:28:44,819 --> 01:28:47,845
With perfumed bodies &
a nasty heart inside.

1546
01:28:48,289 --> 01:28:51,019
You should be happy...
don't lament, okay?

1547
01:28:52,293 --> 01:28:54,955
Hey, leave me... let me do my work.

1548
01:28:56,097 --> 01:28:58,964
Anything wrong with you?

1549
01:28:59,467 --> 01:29:01,935
l'm very fine!

1550
01:29:02,136 --> 01:29:03,034
That's my problem.

1551
01:29:03,304 --> 01:29:05,295
Did you take me to be mad?
l'm not.

1552
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:06,598
l'm always like this.

1553
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:08,138
Oh god!- What happened?

1554
01:29:08,743 --> 01:29:11,075
Atlast l've stamped it.

1555
01:29:11,312 --> 01:29:15,305
Stamp wherever you like.
l'll clean it.

1556
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:16,847
What?- l've to go.

1557
01:29:17,251 --> 01:29:21,449
Go...You've lot of work to attend.
l've only this work.

1558
01:29:21,756 --> 01:29:22,484
That's it.

1559
01:29:37,905 --> 01:29:39,497
Pappu, you know what's this?

1560
01:29:40,441 --> 01:29:43,774
Sweet lime! No...collection Raja!

1561
01:29:44,112 --> 01:29:45,909
l'm going to squeeze out his juice now.

1562
01:29:46,748 --> 01:29:49,148
Dad, why're you talking like
a film villain?

1563
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:50,712
Are you the dean or don?

1564
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:52,080
You don't know.

1565
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:55,947
A famous rowdy Thangavelu consulted
me for hernia operation.

1566
01:29:56,157 --> 01:29:57,089
He'll do whatever l tell him to.

1567
01:29:57,291 --> 01:29:58,451
He's like sathukuddy(sweet like) now.

1568
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:01,126
Sweet like?- ln Tuttokuddy.

1569
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:02,761
l'll call him and make Raja...

1570
01:30:04,632 --> 01:30:07,123
Dad, l'm fear,

1571
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:09,930
that Raja will become dean and.,..

1572
01:30:10,138 --> 01:30:12,936
You'll get involved in rowdism and
become collection Viswanath.

1573
01:30:13,141 --> 01:30:15,609
Relax dad, cool!- Don't worry.

1574
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:17,277
O phone! Attend the phone.

1575
01:30:17,979 --> 01:30:21,608
Hello!- Hello! Pappy l'm Raja.

1576
01:30:23,985 --> 01:30:24,747
Tell me Raja.

1577
01:30:25,153 --> 01:30:27,747
Did your friend Janaki tell you
what l said?

1578
01:30:28,656 --> 01:30:29,714
Why's he calling you here?

1579
01:30:29,924 --> 01:30:31,915
About what
- Embracing therapy.

1580
01:30:32,693 --> 01:30:33,785
Did you embrace your father?

1581
01:30:34,328 --> 01:30:37,627
What does father-in-law say?
- He's calling me father-in-law!

1582
01:30:37,832 --> 01:30:39,459
lf he acts too smart, tell me.

1583
01:30:40,001 --> 01:30:43,300
One of my friend is there in Tuttukuddy.
His name is Thangavel.

1584
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:47,203
lf l tell him...- Raja why all this now?

1585
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:52,880
''lf l pass the exam'',
Janaki said, ''l can meet you''.

1586
01:30:53,347 --> 01:30:54,644
What do you say?

1587
01:30:57,518 --> 01:30:59,281
Yes, what day is tomorrow?
Saturday, right?

1588
01:30:59,487 --> 01:31:02,149
Okay tomorrow at 10'O'clock
at hotel Le Meridian..

1589
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:04,658
...at Disco hall! See you, bye.

1590
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:06,225
What's this?

1591
01:31:06,928 --> 01:31:07,656
Disco?

1592
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:24,342
What work does she have here?

1593
01:31:24,879 --> 01:31:26,005
Hi Raja.

1594
01:31:27,048 --> 01:31:27,514
Me?

1595
01:31:29,617 --> 01:31:32,017
Brother, she's there!- Where?

1596
01:31:32,453 --> 01:31:35,286
She's the one!

1597
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:42,220
She's coming floating.

1598
01:31:43,397 --> 01:31:46,833
You're looking so handsome.

1599
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:48,965
What're you looking at?
Can't you recognise me?

1600
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:51,568
l can.- l'm your Pappu.

1601
01:31:52,573 --> 01:31:55,633
Greetings sister, l'm Vatti!
- What ''Jetty''!- Oh god!

1602
01:31:57,245 --> 01:31:58,803
You've come here correctly as l said!

1603
01:31:59,013 --> 01:32:01,641
ls it?- Hi Pappu!- Hi!

1604
01:32:02,316 --> 01:32:04,284
Hey beat him.- Hey wait!

1605
01:32:07,788 --> 01:32:09,722
lf each tackle ten we can
finish them all.

1606
01:32:09,924 --> 01:32:13,121
Why're you also troubling me?
l'm already vexed!

1607
01:32:33,481 --> 01:32:34,812
Come sweety!- Sweety?

1608
01:32:36,117 --> 01:32:36,811
Who's he?

1609
01:32:37,952 --> 01:32:39,749
My boy friend!- Boy friend means?

1610
01:32:39,954 --> 01:32:43,082
Means a rehearsal before marriage.

1611
01:32:43,291 --> 01:32:45,418
Rehearsal?- Yes.

1612
01:32:45,793 --> 01:32:48,261
Come on, life is short! Let's enjoy.

1613
01:32:49,063 --> 01:32:50,963
Enjoy is a bad word.
Don't use it.

1614
01:32:51,465 --> 01:32:53,763
Okay, are you free on coming Saturday.
- Why?

1615
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:55,926
My boy friend is going abroad.

1616
01:32:56,304 --> 01:32:57,771
Let's both have rehearsal!

1617
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:01,904
lf rehearsal is okay, then
let's marry.

1618
01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:06,107
Pappu, you weren't like l saw
you in your childhood.

1619
01:33:06,314 --> 01:33:08,282
You've changed a lot.- Ofcourse. l know.

1620
01:33:10,484 --> 01:33:12,281
What does lf mean?- Very necessary.

1621
01:33:12,653 --> 01:33:16,612
What?- Somebody is calling you there...

1622
01:33:20,328 --> 01:33:22,489
Pppu, you've changed a lot!

1623
01:33:23,664 --> 01:33:24,790
He must've been shocked!

1624
01:33:24,999 --> 01:33:28,628
Shocked? He was put off completely.

1625
01:33:30,171 --> 01:33:30,865
Dad...

1626
01:33:33,007 --> 01:33:35,805
So nice! Say it once again.

1627
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:39,810
Pappu, you've changed a lot.
- O so sweet!

1628
01:33:40,181 --> 01:33:41,148
Are you happy now father?

1629
01:33:41,349 --> 01:33:44,910
l'm very happy.
- lt's a sin to hurt other's feelings.

1630
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:47,644
l also say the same thing,
shouldn't hurt others feelings.

1631
01:33:47,955 --> 01:33:49,479
But he had hurt my feelings.

1632
01:33:51,258 --> 01:33:55,160
Oh god, when Pappu was a child,
her skirt wouldn't stay on her waist.

1633
01:33:55,363 --> 01:33:56,489
being a child, we could forgive her.

1634
01:33:56,964 --> 01:33:58,898
lt's unjust if she's the same
at this age also.

1635
01:33:59,266 --> 01:34:00,233
lf the skirt goes below the waist,

1636
01:34:00,434 --> 01:34:01,992
lt'll be called socks
and not skirt.

1637
01:34:02,203 --> 01:34:03,830
Dressing up this way is the fashion.

1638
01:34:04,038 --> 01:34:05,164
What a scandalous fashion?

1639
01:34:05,373 --> 01:34:08,171
This is ration! Can't she be little
bit liberal with her clothing?

1640
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:10,501
Oh god! You've to see her dance.

1641
01:34:10,878 --> 01:34:13,506
Those who were ignorant of it,
would've immediately given the keys.

1642
01:34:13,814 --> 01:34:15,839
lt was like fits!

1643
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:18,348
Why're you getting so angry?- Then?

1644
01:34:18,552 --> 01:34:20,520
lf he's a doctor? By his looks
we believe he's.

1645
01:34:20,721 --> 01:34:21,688
You look like a doctor.

1646
01:34:21,889 --> 01:34:23,516
lmmediately we'll feel like
greeting you.

1647
01:34:23,724 --> 01:34:25,521
She never creates that confidence.

1648
01:34:25,726 --> 01:34:26,693
She's something strange..

1649
01:34:26,894 --> 01:34:30,523
You can't change her now... forget her...

1650
01:34:30,898 --> 01:34:32,024
That Dean also!

1651
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,868
None of them are benefited by
this challenge.

1652
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:40,205
What?- No, l'm worried.

1653
01:34:40,408 --> 01:34:42,376
You suggest good ideas.

1654
01:34:44,578 --> 01:34:45,704
What?- Feelings.

1655
01:34:48,749 --> 01:34:51,877
You carry on with your writing.
l'll say whatever l like.

1656
01:34:52,753 --> 01:34:56,211
Pappu is nor wrong.
Can't blame her mother too.

1657
01:34:56,924 --> 01:34:58,721
That was his mistake... He..

1658
01:34:58,993 --> 01:35:00,654
Who?- That Dean!

1659
01:35:00,928 --> 01:35:02,395
look, why're you calling him disrespectfully.

1660
01:35:02,596 --> 01:35:04,894
This's called good rearing!

1661
01:35:05,766 --> 01:35:08,735
You feel like respecting others, right?

1662
01:35:08,936 --> 01:35:09,561
That comes out from
the way you're reared.

1663
01:35:09,770 --> 01:35:11,397
lf he had reared her up properly,

1664
01:35:11,605 --> 01:35:15,564
my Pappu would've been like you now.

1665
01:35:17,278 --> 01:35:19,576
Then would l've been lamenting
to you now.

1666
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:21,577
l would've been talking to her.

1667
01:35:24,952 --> 01:35:28,752
Look, l'm not your Pappu...- l know.

1668
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:30,257
You carry on...

1669
01:35:30,791 --> 01:35:43,761
W W W . T M S T O R R E N T S . C O M

1670
01:35:44,305 --> 01:35:51,268
<i>Forest is laid open.</i>

1671
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:59,443
<i>Wind is swaying the flowers.</i>

1672
01:36:00,721 --> 01:36:04,623
<i>Eyes are laid open.</i>

1673
01:36:04,992 --> 01:36:08,621
<i>Love is killing lives.</i>

1674
01:36:08,829 --> 01:36:21,469
<i>Agony of love in heartl</i>
<i>A Hurricane in the flower.</i>

1675
01:36:54,708 --> 01:37:02,672
<i>A word which came out from my heart,</i>
<i>got choked in my throat.</i>

1676
01:37:02,883 --> 01:37:06,842
<i>My body hasn't parted away from you.</i>

1677
01:37:07,054 --> 01:37:10,854
<i>My legs got rooted.</i>

1678
01:37:11,225 --> 01:37:19,189
<i>l'm the dew drop of the earthl</i>
<i>Oh sunl Take me offl</i>

1679
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:27,205
<i>l'm burning for ages.</i>
<i>Oh dew drop, extinguish mel</i>

1680
01:37:27,408 --> 01:37:30,866
<i>O bondage... O life...</i>

1681
01:37:31,412 --> 01:37:35,872
<i>O feelings...</i>

1682
01:37:36,083 --> 01:37:41,885
<i>Agony of love in heartl</i>
<i>A Hurricane in the flower.</i>

1683
01:37:44,425 --> 01:37:50,728
<i>Forest is laid open.</i>

1684
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:59,563
<i>Wind is swaying the flowers.</i>

1685
01:38:00,941 --> 01:38:04,741
<i>Eyes are laid open.</i>

1686
01:38:05,112 --> 01:38:08,570
<i>Love is killing lives.</i>

1687
01:38:08,782 --> 01:38:21,752
<i>Agony of love in heartl</i>
<i>A Hurricane in the flower.</i>

1688
01:38:30,804 --> 01:38:34,638
Not only you're the patient, me too.

1689
01:38:35,476 --> 01:38:36,443
Love patient...

1690
01:38:37,978 --> 01:38:44,110
l Love Janaki..
But one sided love.

1691
01:38:44,318 --> 01:38:45,285
She's not aware of it!

1692
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,288
No use of one sided love.

1693
01:38:48,822 --> 01:38:50,619
She should hear what l say.

1694
01:38:51,659 --> 01:38:52,956
My love should fall on her ears.

1695
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:58,792
Since morning l indulge in such couplets.

1696
01:38:58,999 --> 01:39:00,466
Vatti gave me coffee...

1697
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:02,133
l said ''if you stir, its coffee''

1698
01:39:02,336 --> 01:39:03,735
Look, how the poems are
flowing out from me.

1699
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:05,303
Poet Kannadasan has said,

1700
01:39:05,506 --> 01:39:08,634
You've to say whatever l wish to say.

1701
01:39:09,243 --> 01:39:10,141
lt's right, isn't it?

1702
01:39:13,847 --> 01:39:15,144
Even if you're not able to say,

1703
01:39:15,349 --> 01:39:16,816
like they say ''Silence is
the indication of acceptance..''

1704
01:39:17,017 --> 01:39:18,985
You're gesturing through
your eyes, that's...

1705
01:39:27,194 --> 01:39:27,819
What?

1706
01:39:28,028 --> 01:39:30,826
l was about to say,
l'm not able to..

1707
01:39:31,031 --> 01:39:32,828
He's showing his eyes!

1708
01:39:33,033 --> 01:39:35,661
yes, He shows his eyes
and we're beaming the torch.

1709
01:39:35,869 --> 01:39:40,329
Not that! He winked at me!
He signaled me!

1710
01:39:40,541 --> 01:39:42,168
Signal?- You come and see please.

1711
01:39:44,211 --> 01:39:47,510
Show your eyes!
Anand sir, wink your eyes, please.

1712
01:39:49,049 --> 01:39:52,018
Forest is laid open!

1713
01:39:52,219 --> 01:39:53,846
There's a different song for him!

1714
01:39:54,054 --> 01:39:58,013
You've to say whatever l wish to say.

1715
01:39:58,225 --> 01:40:00,193
lf you stir, its coffee.

1716
01:40:00,394 --> 01:40:02,191
All of your attend to your work!

1717
01:40:02,396 --> 01:40:06,355
Sir, he will signal now.
- You wait for it, we'll do our work.

1718
01:40:09,236 --> 01:40:11,864
He really did like this...- With his fingers?

1719
01:40:12,406 --> 01:40:13,873
You're also joking!

1720
01:40:14,074 --> 01:40:15,701
He winked at me with his eyes!

1721
01:40:15,909 --> 01:40:16,705
Raja, please understand.

1722
01:40:16,910 --> 01:40:18,036
He can't hear you!

1723
01:40:18,412 --> 01:40:19,709
Even if your voice reaches his ears,

1724
01:40:19,913 --> 01:40:21,710
lt can't reach his brain.
- Why?

1725
01:40:22,249 --> 01:40:23,876
Rumors will go only upto the ear.

1726
01:40:24,084 --> 01:40:26,052
lt we talk about love,
it will reach the brain.

1727
01:40:26,253 --> 01:40:27,220
Look, l'll tell you one thing.

1728
01:40:27,421 --> 01:40:30,049
Suppose one has heart to heart
feelings with another,

1729
01:40:31,258 --> 01:40:35,058
if one thinks, it'll reach the other.

1730
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:37,396
l...

1731
01:40:42,269 --> 01:40:44,396
Janaki, l love you...

1732
01:40:59,453 --> 01:41:01,751
Got the signal! But she
can't hear me.

1733
01:41:01,955 --> 01:41:04,583
Let me go out and try like
a mobile phone.

1734
01:41:07,027 --> 01:41:09,655
Hi uncle...Haven't your
laughing therapy over yet?

1735
01:41:09,863 --> 01:41:11,490
That's why l'm hale and healthy.

1736
01:41:12,199 --> 01:41:13,666
By the by, Janaki, l forgot to tell you,

1737
01:41:13,867 --> 01:41:16,995
On the way l met Ramamohan's son.

1738
01:41:17,704 --> 01:41:20,172
Very handsome! Neuro surgeon.

1739
01:41:21,041 --> 01:41:22,008
He's a real doctor!

1740
01:41:22,376 --> 01:41:26,005
Let's seek your alliance with him.
l'll get it!

1741
01:41:32,386 --> 01:41:32,852
What?

1742
01:41:34,388 --> 01:41:35,184
What's it daddy?

1743
01:41:39,059 --> 01:41:41,357
Raja, how come you're here!
- Hold this.

1744
01:41:42,062 --> 01:41:43,359
l should ask that question.

1745
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:46,858
Have you come to see Pappu.- Yeah! yes!

1746
01:41:47,067 --> 01:41:48,193
Why're you here?

1747
01:41:48,902 --> 01:41:51,700
Oh god! Ruined...!

1748
01:41:51,905 --> 01:41:53,372
Who?- Me!

1749
01:41:54,341 --> 01:41:55,706
This's the bouquet of compromise.

1750
01:41:57,244 --> 01:41:58,711
Please come this side, l'll tell you.

1751
01:42:02,916 --> 01:42:06,875
Ask me what Poo(flower) is this?
- ManniPoo(forgiveness).

1752
01:42:07,254 --> 01:42:09,051
lt's joke... Take it smilingly!

1753
01:42:09,923 --> 01:42:11,220
Please sit down.
- You please...

1754
01:42:13,594 --> 01:42:15,221
l've given you lot of tension.

1755
01:42:15,429 --> 01:42:18,227
Don't take it to heart!
- lt's okay!

1756
01:42:19,266 --> 01:42:22,064
l want to tell you something.

1757
01:42:22,603 --> 01:42:26,562
l don't know how to tell this to a father.
- lt's okay, tell me.

1758
01:42:27,107 --> 01:42:33,068
Your daughter Pappu is little...very bad.

1759
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:34,907
What to do? lt's my fate!

1760
01:42:35,449 --> 01:42:38,247
Okay, l've decided one thing
after seeing you in tension.

1761
01:42:39,453 --> 01:42:42,581
l'll nullify my challenge.
- Good.

1762
01:42:43,190 --> 01:42:44,589
l knew this before itself.

1763
01:42:44,958 --> 01:42:47,256
Pappu and you will not suit each other.

1764
01:42:47,461 --> 01:42:49,759
Her moral background is not right.

1765
01:42:49,963 --> 01:42:52,090
What?- Background, you know, right?

1766
01:42:52,299 --> 01:42:54,199
No sir, her background is beautiful...

1767
01:42:56,136 --> 01:42:59,936
l didn't mean that background...
Pappu is a total waste.

1768
01:43:00,307 --> 01:43:03,105
You've calling your own daughter
a waste.- l've no other choice.

1769
01:43:03,644 --> 01:43:06,613
So, hereafter you'll not
come to the hospital.

1770
01:43:07,414 --> 01:43:11,783
l'll not, but l may come.. - Why?

1771
01:43:11,985 --> 01:43:14,180
First l stepped in it with clash as motive,

1772
01:43:14,388 --> 01:43:16,447
now l think l've to step in for love.

1773
01:43:16,657 --> 01:43:17,453
What do you mean?

1774
01:43:17,658 --> 01:43:20,957
Between a lady and me... a feeling.

1775
01:43:21,161 --> 01:43:22,458
You mean, you're in love.

1776
01:43:22,996 --> 01:43:24,122
lt's the same in all languages.

1777
01:43:24,331 --> 01:43:27,459
l thought you were a big rowdy,
dampness in the stone.

1778
01:43:28,335 --> 01:43:31,304
No, it's my sweat.
- Joke!

1779
01:43:31,838 --> 01:43:34,136
Who's that lucky girl?

1780
01:43:34,341 --> 01:43:36,809
That's....- Look at the shyness.

1781
01:43:37,177 --> 01:43:38,474
Not there...over here.

1782
01:43:38,679 --> 01:43:41,079
Why should l feel shy?
l'll show you.

1783
01:43:41,348 --> 01:43:41,973
Where?

1784
01:43:43,784 --> 01:43:44,478
That's Pappu!

1785
01:43:45,352 --> 01:43:48,412
l don't mean her
but next to her is my girl.

1786
01:43:57,364 --> 01:43:58,160
Haven't brushed your teeth?

1787
01:44:00,467 --> 01:44:01,331
Driving scooter?

1788
01:44:02,369 --> 01:44:04,337
Cough? Shall l get water?

1789
01:44:04,538 --> 01:44:05,505
Are you asking me to go?

1790
01:44:06,206 --> 01:44:07,173
Asking me not to come?

1791
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:21,116
Good morning.

1792
01:44:24,658 --> 01:44:27,957
l wished you but you didn't bother to...

1793
01:44:28,161 --> 01:44:30,629
Angry with me?- Then?

1794
01:44:30,998 --> 01:44:34,798
All of them saw me wishing you
and you didn't bother to...

1795
01:44:35,002 --> 01:44:35,627
l feel ashamed...

1796
01:44:35,836 --> 01:44:38,737
Did you tell Pappu's father that
you would marry me?

1797
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:40,463
Oh! That's why you're angry.

1798
01:44:40,674 --> 01:44:42,471
But it's uncivil of you
not to wish me back.

1799
01:44:42,676 --> 01:44:43,802
Oh god! Good morning.

1800
01:44:44,011 --> 01:44:46,809
Good morning! You look good
even when you're angry.

1801
01:44:47,014 --> 01:44:49,744
Look, l've forgotten everything.
Please turn this side.

1802
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:53,319
Even my topic got changed, when you
saw me like that.- Tell me.

1803
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:55,147
l talk Tamil fluently but...

1804
01:44:55,355 --> 01:44:58,324
...l'm not able to find a word
which l want to..

1805
01:44:58,525 --> 01:44:59,150
l've got it!

1806
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:00,485
Feelings!

1807
01:45:02,029 --> 01:45:05,157
l've some feelings for you...
Do you've the same?

1808
01:45:05,699 --> 01:45:07,166
No...

1809
01:45:07,367 --> 01:45:07,833
No?

1810
01:45:08,201 --> 01:45:09,498
l am a one sided feeler then?

1811
01:45:09,703 --> 01:45:10,897
lt's my fate, leave me.

1812
01:45:11,538 --> 01:45:12,505
Wait!

1813
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:15,668
l like you a lot!You're a
very good person.- Thanks!

1814
01:45:16,209 --> 01:45:18,336
No, l meant, in a different way.

1815
01:45:19,379 --> 01:45:21,006
You can make anybody happy.

1816
01:45:21,214 --> 01:45:22,010
Anybody?

1817
01:45:22,215 --> 01:45:26,174
Mother, father...
- Oh, you're going on that route...

1818
01:45:26,386 --> 01:45:30,186
Brothers... - Where?

1819
01:45:30,457 --> 01:45:35,190
After telling all the relations,
and finally telling about our relation here.

1820
01:45:35,729 --> 01:45:37,196
Oh, is this spot not good?

1821
01:45:37,564 --> 01:45:40,362
You're walking searching for
the spots but not replying.

1822
01:45:40,567 --> 01:45:41,864
Say yes or no!

1823
01:45:42,135 --> 01:45:44,968
Even if it's 'no', say 'Yes'.
What's wrong in it.

1824
01:45:46,573 --> 01:45:47,540
Good morning doctor.

1825
01:45:48,909 --> 01:45:50,376
Thank heavens! She didn't
wish you back also.

1826
01:45:50,577 --> 01:45:51,703
l thought l was the only sucker.

1827
01:45:51,912 --> 01:45:53,880
l think she doesn't have the
habit of wishing 'Good morning'.

1828
01:45:54,247 --> 01:45:56,215
Look here... One minute.

1829
01:45:57,084 --> 01:46:01,043
Whatever may be the result, tell me
but no suspense.

1830
01:46:01,254 --> 01:46:02,721
l'll not be able to bear it.

1831
01:46:02,923 --> 01:46:03,890
Raja, please.

1832
01:46:04,424 --> 01:46:05,721
Asking me to sit here? Okay!

1833
01:46:07,594 --> 01:46:09,892
you finish your talk,
then we'll talk.

1834
01:46:10,097 --> 01:46:12,065
Your reports have come.

1835
01:46:12,766 --> 01:46:13,232
One minute.

1836
01:46:15,435 --> 01:46:17,733
You told me ''feelings''..
What did you mean?

1837
01:46:20,774 --> 01:46:25,905
l feel a butterfly flying
in my stomach.

1838
01:46:26,113 --> 01:46:27,080
Do you feel the pain?

1839
01:46:27,948 --> 01:46:31,748
Butterfly in the stomach
and pain is here.

1840
01:46:32,285 --> 01:46:36,415
For how long?- For the past few days.

1841
01:46:36,623 --> 01:46:38,090
ls it?- What's wrong with you?

1842
01:46:38,458 --> 01:46:42,258
A butterfly in the stomach.
But pain is there...

1843
01:46:42,462 --> 01:46:43,087
...and not here.

1844
01:46:43,630 --> 01:46:45,757
You're very lucky, both in
the same spot! For me...

1845
01:46:45,966 --> 01:46:47,263
Raja, will you be quiet?

1846
01:46:48,635 --> 01:46:49,932
l want to talk to him personally.

1847
01:46:51,304 --> 01:46:53,431
Oh medical? We'll talk later.

1848
01:46:53,974 --> 01:46:55,271
Then we'll talk.

1849
01:46:57,644 --> 01:46:58,269
Tell me doctor.

1850
01:46:59,146 --> 01:47:02,877
Can somebody come from your home?

1851
01:47:04,818 --> 01:47:06,376
Why? What happened?

1852
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:08,947
You should've come little early.

1853
01:47:12,659 --> 01:47:14,126
Hereafter, you shouldn't lose hope.

1854
01:47:18,665 --> 01:47:22,624
You've stomach cancer.

1855
01:47:31,445 --> 01:47:32,810
you've to get admitted immediately.

1856
01:47:37,684 --> 01:47:39,982
Doctor, l've to finish
my duties.

1857
01:47:40,187 --> 01:47:43,156
Okay, finish everything &
get admitted in the after noon.

1858
01:47:43,356 --> 01:47:46,154
Afternoon means...
half a day is my time.

1859
01:47:47,527 --> 01:47:50,496
Right?- l didn't mean that.

1860
01:47:52,299 --> 01:47:52,993
l've to buy a house...

1861
01:47:53,934 --> 01:47:54,992
l've to send my mother
on pilgrimage to Haj.

1862
01:47:56,136 --> 01:47:58,331
l've to get my sister married.

1863
01:47:59,539 --> 01:48:00,506
l've to settle down in life.

1864
01:48:03,210 --> 01:48:05,508
Will you give me only
half-a-day for all this?

1865
01:48:06,546 --> 01:48:07,672
According to what you say,

1866
01:48:08,315 --> 01:48:11,011
l think, god has given only
half-a-day more to my life.

1867
01:48:12,886 --> 01:48:14,615
Okay doctor, see you.

1868
01:48:18,725 --> 01:48:21,193
Why it's happening only to me?

1869
01:48:21,394 --> 01:48:23,453
l haven't smoked or drank...

1870
01:48:24,064 --> 01:48:25,531
l've not touched even a woman...

1871
01:48:26,233 --> 01:48:28,531
My friends do drink,
roam with women,

1872
01:48:29,736 --> 01:48:32,705
l also wanted that type of life.

1873
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:36,437
l thought of starting my life
after finishing my duties.

1874
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:40,038
Now l think my life
will end before that.

1875
01:48:51,825 --> 01:48:54,726
How long will he be alive...?

1876
01:48:55,595 --> 01:48:56,892
lf god permits...

1877
01:48:57,097 --> 01:48:59,395
Have you studied about
god or medicine?

1878
01:48:59,766 --> 01:49:01,734
l'm asking you,
how long will be survive?

1879
01:49:03,703 --> 01:49:07,400
For a little more time. lt's very difficult
to say but after treatment...

1880
01:49:07,607 --> 01:49:08,904
Why treat him at all?

1881
01:49:09,109 --> 01:49:10,076
you say that he'll not survive...

1882
01:49:10,544 --> 01:49:11,738
ls it to bring revenue
to the hospital?

1883
01:49:11,945 --> 01:49:14,743
You'll ask him to do many tests
and bill him heavyly.

1884
01:49:15,048 --> 01:49:17,073
l din't know all this earlier,
but now l've seen it.

1885
01:49:17,450 --> 01:49:18,576
That's what doctors do.

1886
01:49:19,052 --> 01:49:20,246
Sorry, what to do?

1887
01:49:21,454 --> 01:49:23,922
Will the keeper of a funeral ghat
know the grief of one crying there?

1888
01:49:25,625 --> 01:49:26,751
Why did you tell him?

1889
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,257
lf it was me, l wouldn't have told him.

1890
01:49:28,461 --> 01:49:29,428
ls he studying medicine?

1891
01:49:29,629 --> 01:49:31,597
You're telling him about the diseases.

1892
01:49:32,465 --> 01:49:33,432
You could've sent him away saying
that he has only stomach ache,

1893
01:49:33,633 --> 01:49:38,593
go home, have liquor & enjoy
with women.

1894
01:49:38,805 --> 01:49:41,706
What are you saying?
- l'm talking about the facts of life.

1895
01:49:42,976 --> 01:49:44,603
ls studying medicine for it necessary?

1896
01:49:45,245 --> 01:49:46,439
You say he has no chances.

1897
01:49:46,813 --> 01:49:48,610
He only needs persons
to care for him now.

1898
01:49:49,983 --> 01:49:53,783
He needs only my embracing therapy.

1899
01:50:00,327 --> 01:50:03,626
Wait...- Leave me sir.

1900
01:50:03,830 --> 01:50:04,797
l've go home and cry.

1901
01:50:05,165 --> 01:50:06,462
l'll be disgraced
in front of everybody.

1902
01:50:06,666 --> 01:50:07,724
Listen to me please.

1903
01:50:10,437 --> 01:50:12,462
Don't think god has given
you only half a days's time.

1904
01:50:12,672 --> 01:50:13,969
Think that he has given me.

1905
01:50:14,174 --> 01:50:16,972
l'll get your sister married.

1906
01:50:17,177 --> 01:50:19,645
l'll send your mother on
pilgrimage and look after her.

1907
01:50:19,846 --> 01:50:22,144
Hey, who're you to
look after my mother?

1908
01:50:22,515 --> 01:50:23,641
How are you qualified to know?

1909
01:50:24,017 --> 01:50:25,644
You're going to live you
can talk whatever you like.

1910
01:50:25,852 --> 01:50:29,151
But l...l'm going to die.

1911
01:50:32,359 --> 01:50:36,659
Listen to me. All of us
are going to die.

1912
01:50:36,863 --> 01:50:41,323
l'm also going to die.
Life is to enjoy.

1913
01:50:41,534 --> 01:50:44,162
Look, my mother has
taught me a therapy.

1914
01:50:44,371 --> 01:50:46,100
That's embracing therapy.

1915
01:50:46,306 --> 01:50:49,434
Hey go away...go away.

1916
01:50:50,710 --> 01:50:52,007
You'll not understand all this.

1917
01:50:52,212 --> 01:50:56,171
Hey Zakir...listen to me.

1918
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:03,515
Nothing sister, it's my fault.

1919
01:51:12,732 --> 01:51:14,359
Where does a person go after death?

1920
01:51:15,835 --> 01:51:18,861
My father often says,
''They'll turn into stars.''

1921
01:51:20,907 --> 01:51:25,037
Look there. The one big
bright star is father.

1922
01:51:25,745 --> 01:51:27,144
Next to it is uncle.

1923
01:51:27,580 --> 01:51:28,547
Next to it is...

1924
01:51:29,416 --> 01:51:32,283
Brother, l saw my
big uncle yesterday.

1925
01:51:34,821 --> 01:51:37,153
Oh god! Population has
increased in Tamil Nadu.

1926
01:51:37,357 --> 01:51:40,724
lf it increases here, then naturally
there will be a increase there also.

1927
01:51:40,927 --> 01:51:42,554
Let's decrease our
population in the hostel.

1928
01:51:42,762 --> 01:51:44,059
Pack all our baggage and leave.

1929
01:51:44,431 --> 01:51:47,400
You've hidden something in your mind,
tell me what's it?

1930
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:49,067
You'll not believe
if l tell you.

1931
01:51:50,203 --> 01:51:51,636
One person had hit me.

1932
01:51:52,272 --> 01:51:54,740
You? Tell me who's he?

1933
01:51:54,941 --> 01:51:55,908
We'll prove ourselves to him.

1934
01:51:58,945 --> 01:51:59,570
Hey, switch on the light.

1935
01:52:04,951 --> 01:52:05,849
Where's Zakir's bed?

1936
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:11,078
Where's Zakir's bed? Come.

1937
01:52:17,297 --> 01:52:19,492
Hey...You're Zakir,
aren't you?- Yes.

1938
01:52:19,699 --> 01:52:23,362
Did you hit my brother?
- Who is your brother?

1939
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:24,332
Asking who...?

1940
01:52:25,472 --> 01:52:26,268
l didn't hit anybody.

1941
01:52:26,473 --> 01:52:30,102
My brother had asked me to show
you a more important thing than death.

1942
01:52:31,010 --> 01:52:52,127
A   B I T T E R K R A B   R I P

1943
01:52:52,665 --> 01:52:55,293
<i>Sina Thana came laughing.</i>

1944
01:52:55,502 --> 01:52:58,130
<i>and went after a flirt</i>
<i>who came on her own.</i>

1945
01:52:58,338 --> 01:53:00,966
<i>She shed honey,</i>

1946
01:53:01,174 --> 01:53:03,802
<i>and disappeared</i>
<i>after the break of dawn.</i>

1947
01:53:15,955 --> 01:53:27,492
<i>Sina Thana came laughing and went</i>
<i>after a flirt who came on her own.</i>

1948
01:53:37,544 --> 01:53:44,507
<i>O sister...O sister...</i>

1949
01:54:02,569 --> 01:54:08,030
<i>Sina Thana came laughing and went</i>
<i>after a flirt who came on her own.</i>

1950
01:54:08,241 --> 01:54:10,869
<i>She shed honey.</i>

1951
01:54:11,077 --> 01:54:14,046
<i>and disappeared after</i>
<i>the break of dawn.</i>

1952
01:54:43,109 --> 01:54:48,741
<i>lt's my body. Ask me once</i>
<i>when it'll blush out of shyness?</i>

1953
01:54:48,948 --> 01:54:51,917
<i>Do you want to know the</i>
<i>meaning for meaningless words?</i>

1954
01:54:52,118 --> 01:54:54,586
<i>This is the school for that.</i>

1955
01:54:54,787 --> 01:54:56,084
<i>despite of the fences,</i>

1956
01:54:56,289 --> 01:55:00,419
<i>his legs will be eager to cross</i>
<i>if one sees the beauty.</i>

1957
01:55:00,627 --> 01:55:03,596
<i>Even if humans have come from monkeys,</i>

1958
01:55:03,796 --> 01:55:06,264
<i>Still they have tails.</i>

1959
01:55:06,633 --> 01:55:09,431
<i>There's no algae in</i>
<i>the running water.</i>

1960
01:55:09,636 --> 01:55:12,264
<i>No diseases when you</i>
<i>extricate your emotions.</i>

1961
01:55:12,472 --> 01:55:15,270
<i>Gemini is the movie</i>
<i>taken to enjoy life.</i>

1962
01:55:15,475 --> 01:55:17,773
<i>l'm going to show</i>
<i>that only to you.</i>

1963
01:55:29,989 --> 01:55:35,291
<i>Sina Thana came laughing and went</i>
<i>after a flirt who came on her own.</i>

1964
01:55:35,495 --> 01:55:38,293
<i>She shed honey.</i>

1965
01:55:38,498 --> 01:55:41,296
<i>and disappeared after</i>
<i>the break of dawn.</i>

1966
01:55:58,851 --> 01:56:03,151
Raja brother had asked me to make you
happy no matter whatever l've to do.

1967
01:56:05,358 --> 01:56:07,326
l was afraid when they dragged me.

1968
01:56:14,801 --> 01:56:15,995
So instead of doing your duty,

1969
01:56:17,203 --> 01:56:19,000
you're coming after enjoying
with them and with a girl.

1970
01:56:19,205 --> 01:56:21,833
To take required medicines
for Zakir...- Shut up.

1971
01:56:23,209 --> 01:56:26,838
Hereafter l'll not stay quiet.
Let me see whether its him or me.

1972
01:56:28,381 --> 01:56:28,847
Leave them.

1973
01:56:29,882 --> 01:56:32,851
Sir, don't get angry.
They did it for me.

1974
01:56:33,486 --> 01:56:34,510
lt is my fault.

1975
01:56:34,887 --> 01:56:37,856
You needn't give me any punishment,

1976
01:56:38,725 --> 01:56:41,455
God has already fixed my death.

1977
01:56:41,995 --> 01:56:46,193
Sir, treat this as my last wish,
don't do anything to them please.

1978
01:56:46,899 --> 01:56:49,197
Hey, l've a severe head ache.

1979
01:56:49,402 --> 01:56:51,870
Hey, there's an embracing threapy
for it. Come on embrace.

1980
01:56:52,071 --> 01:56:55,700
Nimmi, l also have headache,
embrace me too.- Hey get lost.

1981
01:56:56,242 --> 01:57:01,202
Do you know whom Raja embraced
first in this hospital?- Who.

1982
01:57:01,414 --> 01:57:02,210
Me only.

1983
01:57:02,415 --> 01:57:05,714
There's some power in
his embracing threapy.

1984
01:57:05,918 --> 01:57:08,045
Hey take it fast.

1985
01:57:23,369 --> 01:57:24,836
l felt that you said something.

1986
01:57:25,104 --> 01:57:25,900
i didn't say anything.

1987
01:57:26,773 --> 01:57:27,899
How you'll say?

1988
01:57:28,107 --> 01:57:29,734
lt'll work out only
where there's feelings.

1989
01:57:29,942 --> 01:57:31,068
While someone going out
they'll ask, ''where're you going''?

1990
01:57:31,277 --> 01:57:34,075
They say, shouldn't ask such a
question or say, ''lts okay, tell me.''

1991
01:57:34,280 --> 01:57:35,907
Where're such feelings here?

1992
01:57:36,115 --> 01:57:37,082
This is a hospital?

1993
01:57:37,283 --> 01:57:40,741
Patient calls doctor ''god''
Calls nurse sister.

1994
01:57:40,953 --> 01:57:42,420
But you call them by numbers.

1995
01:57:42,622 --> 01:57:44,249
You sweep the patients
away like rubbish.

1996
01:57:44,457 --> 01:57:46,425
There's no good hearted person here,
that's why l'm quitting.

1997
01:57:46,626 --> 01:57:48,924
Please understand.
You've to be in this hospital.

1998
01:57:49,128 --> 01:57:51,426
Why should l be
where l'm uninvited?

1999
01:57:51,798 --> 01:57:55,427
l expressed my feelings to
Pappu but she returned to me.

2000
01:57:55,635 --> 01:57:58,263
This dean is disrespecting us.

2001
01:57:58,471 --> 01:58:00,268
l thought of expressing
those feelings to you,

2002
01:58:00,473 --> 01:58:01,963
You didn't reciprocate
so l'm leaving.

2003
01:58:02,475 --> 01:58:04,500
Okay, l've.- What?

2004
01:58:05,478 --> 01:58:06,069
Feelings.

2005
01:58:06,479 --> 01:58:08,970
Unload all the things and
keep them back in my room.

2006
01:58:10,149 --> 01:58:11,275
Brother why're you turning the
tables like this?

2007
01:58:11,484 --> 01:58:12,610
We spent 1 and 1/2 hour
to load all this.

2008
01:58:13,586 --> 01:58:15,554
She accepted that
she has feelings for me.

2009
01:58:16,823 --> 01:58:17,448
<i>Hey unload all the things.</i>

2010
01:58:17,657 --> 01:58:19,056
<i>We can load and unload</i>
<i>1 0 times for it.</i>

2011
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:20,086
Thank you madam.

2012
01:58:21,327 --> 01:58:23,158
Brother, she has gone.

2013
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:24,854
ls she walking away in a huff?

2014
01:58:25,064 --> 01:58:27,123
No...she kept her hand like this.

2015
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:29,297
Do you mean to say
that's not shyness?

2016
01:58:29,602 --> 01:58:30,466
Why're you telling all this to me?

2017
01:58:30,670 --> 01:58:32,797
Go and catch her,
she may go away.

2018
01:58:33,039 --> 01:58:35,473
Hey, unload the things fast.

2019
01:58:35,842 --> 01:58:36,809
Oh god. l thought that you had left...

2020
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:38,475
Dean has called you immediately.

2021
01:58:38,678 --> 01:58:40,475
Leave my hand, follow me.

2022
01:58:42,515 --> 01:58:49,978
Oh god, this is attention. Yuck.
- Wait...sister, you go...

2023
01:58:50,189 --> 01:58:51,986
Only we've to adjust, since
she has got some feelings for me.

2024
01:58:52,191 --> 01:58:56,252
Let both of us follow...come
- Why is he talking like this?

2025
01:58:58,431 --> 01:59:00,126
Father-in-law, did you call me?

2026
01:59:00,333 --> 01:59:02,324
Hereafter, you aren't my
father-in-law everything is over.

2027
01:59:02,702 --> 01:59:06,661
This isn't a hotel
but a hospital.- Yes.

2028
01:59:07,039 --> 01:59:08,597
Discipline is important
here and not disco.

2029
01:59:08,875 --> 01:59:10,467
Oh, are you talking about Zakir.

2030
01:59:11,043 --> 01:59:14,171
He's counting his days
how to discipline him?

2031
01:59:14,380 --> 01:59:16,348
We can live with discipline.
But how to die with discipline?

2032
01:59:16,549 --> 01:59:18,176
Do it and show. My work will be over.

2033
01:59:18,951 --> 01:59:20,384
l've made him laugh.

2034
01:59:20,653 --> 01:59:22,848
lnstead of being happy,
you're getting angry.

2035
01:59:24,223 --> 01:59:25,781
So you agree that you're solely
responsible for all this.

2036
01:59:26,325 --> 01:59:27,690
Why only yes. l even feel proud.

2037
01:59:28,060 --> 01:59:29,652
Which is proud, one dying
with laughter..

2038
01:59:29,862 --> 01:59:32,194
Or one like you making other's
die by laughter?- That is it.

2039
01:59:33,232 --> 01:59:34,164
This is your dismissal order.

2040
01:59:34,734 --> 01:59:35,860
Get out with your baggage.

2041
01:59:36,169 --> 01:59:37,067
Me?- Yes.

2042
01:59:38,237 --> 01:59:38,862
Too late.

2043
01:59:39,238 --> 01:59:40,637
l was about to quit.

2044
01:59:41,340 --> 01:59:43,706
But when my lover
stopped me,

2045
01:59:43,910 --> 01:59:45,070
l also decided not to.

2046
01:59:45,578 --> 01:59:47,546
l've promised her in my heart
She is not aware of it.

2047
01:59:47,747 --> 01:59:49,044
l'll not go even
if you chase me out.

2048
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:51,643
l'll throw you out with
the help of the police.

2049
01:59:53,019 --> 01:59:55,647
When police couldn't put me in
how'll they throw me out?

2050
01:59:56,522 --> 01:59:58,046
Are you going to dial the number?

2051
01:59:58,491 --> 01:59:59,981
Do you atleast know the
name of the local inspector?

2052
02:00:00,193 --> 02:00:03,390
lt'll go to the control room.
lt seems he's going to give me exit.

2053
02:00:03,596 --> 02:00:04,585
l'm the one who give
entry.

2054
02:00:04,797 --> 02:00:08,733
Oh god, did you think that
l did it wantonly.

2055
02:00:09,268 --> 02:00:10,599
Will anybody do it wantonly?

2056
02:00:10,937 --> 02:00:13,997
But l will, that's my
style...see you?

2057
02:00:16,375 --> 02:00:16,864
Sorry.

2058
02:00:21,147 --> 02:00:23,342
Sister, when is the doctor
going to discharge me?

2059
02:00:56,415 --> 02:00:59,213
Somebody fill up the
admission form for me.

2060
02:01:05,658 --> 02:01:08,650
Raja, what happened?
- Come...come....

2061
02:01:09,495 --> 02:01:11,554
Nothing, just 2 bottles...

2062
02:01:11,797 --> 02:01:14,459
Did you drink liquor
- No, l broke them.

2063
02:01:15,201 --> 02:01:17,669
One on my hand, other one on
my head and on my forehead.

2064
02:01:18,271 --> 02:01:21,638
Then on my neck...- Spine...

2065
02:01:22,675 --> 02:01:25,143
lt seem there was a
confusion about it.- No compression.

2066
02:01:25,344 --> 02:01:26,311
Okay, let it be anything.

2067
02:01:27,013 --> 02:01:27,843
So sad, this poor fellow,

2068
02:01:28,447 --> 02:01:29,641
got frightened after seeing me,

2069
02:01:29,849 --> 02:01:30,975
he had climbed down the
stairs on his hands.

2070
02:01:31,217 --> 02:01:33,481
Already his legs are gone.
Hey duck...

2071
02:01:33,786 --> 02:01:35,845
Ask his name?- What?

2072
02:01:36,555 --> 02:01:39,649
ln Tamil, it's Donald duck.

2073
02:01:40,359 --> 02:01:41,553
Why did you do like this?

2074
02:01:41,894 --> 02:01:43,327
Look here, very nice.

2075
02:01:43,696 --> 02:01:45,664
There's a saying, ''Rocking the
cradle and pinching the baby''.

2076
02:01:45,865 --> 02:01:48,390
You stopped me from going saying
that you've the feeling of love for me.

2077
02:01:49,135 --> 02:01:51,569
But they told me to leave.

2078
02:01:52,038 --> 02:01:53,437
So, l immediately
decided what to do,

2079
02:01:53,639 --> 02:01:55,539
and planned this drama
and got admitted.

2080
02:01:55,741 --> 02:01:56,833
Do you know, what's my tension?

2081
02:01:57,376 --> 02:01:59,003
lt was okay, if it was a
charitable hospital.

2082
02:01:59,512 --> 02:02:01,002
They're more cunning than me.

2083
02:02:02,214 --> 02:02:04,205
l'm tensed whether they'll
bill me heavily.

2084
02:02:04,617 --> 02:02:07,609
lf he was my father-in-law,
it was okay to pay.

2085
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:10,220
Now he's not!
That's what l'm thinking.

2086
02:02:12,725 --> 02:02:14,215
What's going on here actually?

2087
02:02:14,493 --> 02:02:16,620
Okay, can you get it clearly?

2088
02:02:17,763 --> 02:02:19,458
l would've broken his
limbs in anger.

2089
02:02:19,632 --> 02:02:22,658
Why do we've to? Already
they're broken into pieces.

2090
02:02:22,868 --> 02:02:25,598
Nothing doing. Make him alright
and discharge him immediately.

2091
02:02:25,805 --> 02:02:28,638
Then, we've to use fevicol to stick
them and discharge him.

2092
02:02:30,142 --> 02:02:30,733
Joking?

2093
02:02:30,943 --> 02:02:32,604
Sorry!- l don't know
what you'll do!

2094
02:02:32,812 --> 02:02:34,973
l want him out of this
hospital within a week.

2095
02:02:35,247 --> 02:02:37,442
Yes sir.

2096
02:02:37,683 --> 02:02:38,843
Oh god!

2097
02:02:45,858 --> 02:02:47,086
Excuse me! Way please.

2098
02:02:48,761 --> 02:02:50,058
Do you know a good thing in him?

2099
02:02:50,262 --> 02:02:52,890
He remains the same in
victory or defeat.

2100
02:02:53,165 --> 02:02:54,962
That's said in every Philosophy.

2101
02:02:55,334 --> 02:02:56,733
Look, how calm he's..

2102
02:02:57,269 --> 02:02:59,635
and he's a calm patient, they call
him a coma patient, sinners.

2103
02:03:01,841 --> 02:03:02,808
Hey Raja, look there.

2104
02:03:03,509 --> 02:03:05,238
ls he winking his eyes,
leave that.

2105
02:03:05,845 --> 02:03:08,973
He'll wink only at us like a heroine.

2106
02:03:09,181 --> 02:03:11,308
When l bring somebody to
prove it, he'll ditch me.

2107
02:03:11,517 --> 02:03:15,476
Leave that. You tell me,
are you free today?

2108
02:03:16,622 --> 02:03:17,316
What does it mean?

2109
02:03:18,190 --> 02:03:20,317
As per the doctor, l'll be
free only for few days.

2110
02:03:21,193 --> 02:03:22,023
Then you can't catch me.

2111
02:03:22,361 --> 02:03:23,089
l'll fly away!

2112
02:03:23,295 --> 02:03:25,923
Hey, don't talk about this
grief Philosophy to me.

2113
02:03:26,332 --> 02:03:27,162
l'm collection Raja!

2114
02:03:27,366 --> 02:03:29,493
Who can take you away
when l'm here.

2115
02:03:29,702 --> 02:03:32,000
Who can?- God of demon can!

2116
02:03:32,438 --> 02:03:34,668
No dearth of jokes with you.

2117
02:03:34,874 --> 02:03:38,332
l feel like crying when you crack jokes.
Don't put me off.

2118
02:03:38,644 --> 02:03:40,339
l've 2 tickets for the night show.

2119
02:03:40,546 --> 02:03:43,014
Are you going?- 2 tickets? with whom?

2120
02:03:43,883 --> 02:03:46,181
Without asking about the movie,
You're asking with whom?

2121
02:03:46,385 --> 02:03:46,851
That's somebody else.

2122
02:03:47,052 --> 02:03:51,011
a friend who insists in watching
movie with you.

2123
02:03:51,557 --> 02:03:52,353
Who's that?

2124
02:03:53,225 --> 02:03:55,022
Sorry, who's that? Tell me.

2125
02:03:55,394 --> 02:03:57,521
Sina Thana came laughing..

2126
02:03:57,730 --> 02:04:03,691
Play the tune man,
went after a flirt who came on her own.

2127
02:04:03,903 --> 02:04:04,870
Look he's winking.

2128
02:04:05,070 --> 02:04:08,528
Father.. - Slowly.

2129
02:04:09,108 --> 02:04:13,044
Sir, please sir!
Will my father recover?

2130
02:04:13,245 --> 02:04:14,212
How do l know?

2131
02:04:14,914 --> 02:04:16,541
Hold him!

2132
02:04:17,082 --> 02:04:19,209
He didn't take anything since a week.

2133
02:04:19,418 --> 02:04:20,715
Will you please shut up?

2134
02:04:21,921 --> 02:04:23,548
You're a doctor! Don't lament like a kid.

2135
02:04:23,756 --> 02:04:27,214
l'm a kid for my father.
He made me a doctor.

2136
02:04:27,426 --> 02:04:30,224
Okay relax!

2137
02:04:31,096 --> 02:04:33,223
Don't give him anything to eat.
- Okay sir.

2138
02:04:33,432 --> 02:04:36,230
Sir, my feeling is,
he'll recover if he takes something.

2139
02:04:36,435 --> 02:04:38,733
<i>lf he takes anything...then</i>
<i>order for a chicken briyani.</i>

2140
02:04:39,104 --> 02:04:41,402
<i>Do You've any sense?</i>
<i>Can he take anything?</i>

2141
02:04:41,607 --> 02:04:42,733
<i>lt'll get stuck in his throat.</i>

2142
02:04:43,375 --> 02:04:44,399
Don't consider him a patient.

2143
02:04:44,610 --> 02:04:46,805
Consider to be a human
with blood and flesh.

2144
02:04:47,279 --> 02:04:48,906
Sister, tell him.
This is your subject.

2145
02:04:49,615 --> 02:04:52,083
Rajaram, will you...- Thank you.

2146
02:04:55,721 --> 02:04:59,248
Hello, hey Vaddi... not audible.

2147
02:04:59,458 --> 02:05:00,755
l'm holding it in my left hand
and talking, that's why.

2148
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:01,756
Hear attentively.

2149
02:05:05,965 --> 02:05:07,091
Why're you laughing man?

2150
02:05:07,299 --> 02:05:09,028
Who can play better than this?

2151
02:05:11,303 --> 02:05:12,770
lt's good only if the sound is heard.

2152
02:05:27,152 --> 02:05:28,619
Brother, Zakhir.

2153
02:05:28,821 --> 02:05:31,289
Come, you've come before 12'O'clock.

2154
02:05:31,824 --> 02:05:32,950
Didn't you watch the full movie?

2155
02:05:33,158 --> 02:05:34,785
Why's he laughing? What happened?

2156
02:05:34,994 --> 02:05:36,621
What else will happen,
when she's there?

2157
02:05:36,929 --> 02:05:39,022
Okay, pocket the coin....

2158
02:05:42,167 --> 02:05:42,633
Brother...

2159
02:06:09,862 --> 02:06:11,830
Look how my bait is working!.

2160
02:06:16,535 --> 02:06:17,331
<i>Brother, oldy is comingl</i>

2161
02:06:17,536 --> 02:06:18,503
Fish has only bitten the worm!

2162
02:06:18,704 --> 02:06:20,501
Hasn't got stuck in the hook yet,
let it come.

2163
02:06:23,876 --> 02:06:26,845
You play, let anybody come.

2164
02:06:33,886 --> 02:06:34,682
Hey move...

2165
02:06:36,555 --> 02:06:37,681
Careful!

2166
02:06:39,892 --> 02:06:40,517
Sit down!

2167
02:06:50,569 --> 02:06:53,037
Oldy must've played carom long ago.

2168
02:06:53,238 --> 02:06:54,705
He'll not know which to strike!

2169
02:06:54,907 --> 02:06:57,034
First he has to strike red
and then black.

2170
02:06:57,242 --> 02:06:58,709
Can you differentiate between
red and black?

2171
02:06:58,911 --> 02:07:00,037
His sight is not good!

2172
02:07:01,413 --> 02:07:01,879
Oh!!!

2173
02:07:16,095 --> 02:07:17,221
Very good! He has pocketted it.

2174
02:07:18,597 --> 02:07:22,226
So what? Pocketting a follow on coin
is difficult at this age.

2175
02:07:22,601 --> 02:07:24,228
Let's see whether
he pockets it or not?

2176
02:07:27,106 --> 02:07:28,073
Let's see it...- Look, how he's staring.

2177
02:07:46,291 --> 02:07:47,258
Take this juice.- Give it to me...

2178
02:07:49,962 --> 02:07:52,430
He has ended his fast
by taking the juice.

2179
02:07:54,299 --> 02:07:56,699
Father... father...

2345
02:20:13,638 --> 02:20:15,663
How to tell him l'm not.

2346
02:20:17,275 --> 02:20:21,769
Oh god. His mother will come tomorrow.

2347
02:20:23,381 --> 02:20:23,847
Please...

2348
02:20:24,048 --> 02:20:25,481
What am l to tell her?

2349
02:20:26,484 --> 02:20:29,214
lf it was money, l could collect it
and give her. l'm a Collection Raja.

2350
02:20:30,455 --> 02:20:34,687
But how to give this to her.
- Relax.

2351
02:20:34,959 --> 02:20:36,426
What am l to tell his mother?

2352
02:20:38,129 --> 02:20:41,155
That l'm not god...
and you're all not doctors.

2353
02:20:41,800 --> 02:20:43,358
How am l to tell her that?

2354
02:20:44,402 --> 02:20:45,926
What the hell did you
study for 5 years?

2355
02:20:47,739 --> 02:20:48,933
Hey, get lost.

2356
02:20:59,050 --> 02:21:00,950
Okay, let's start.

2357
02:21:01,686 --> 02:21:02,482
Shoot your question.

2358
02:21:04,255 --> 02:21:07,315
What are the symptoms of
diabetic millitus?

2359
02:21:07,959 --> 02:21:12,760
The symptoms are
polyhedra, unusual theist.

2360
02:21:13,364 --> 02:21:15,457
Policrea frequent urination.

2361
02:21:15,834 --> 02:21:17,631
and unusual loss of weight.

2362
02:21:28,613 --> 02:21:29,238
Silence.

2363
02:21:34,052 --> 02:21:34,518
Next.

2364
02:21:35,620 --> 02:21:36,211
No.

2365
02:21:37,021 --> 02:21:40,081
l'm going to ask the next question.

2366
02:21:43,661 --> 02:21:46,858
ln fact, l'm going to
ask all the question.

2367
02:21:51,803 --> 02:21:55,432
Well Mr.Raja, what are the
effects of cancer?

2368
02:21:57,742 --> 02:22:01,678
Don't you know the answer or
can't understand the question.

2369
02:22:02,213 --> 02:22:02,975
l'll ask you in Tamil.

2370
02:22:04,282 --> 02:22:06,182
What are the effects of cancer?

2371
02:22:09,153 --> 02:22:11,849
l'm not able to bear the stomach ache.
You've to save me.

2372
02:22:12,757 --> 02:22:16,887
Loss of apetitite,
unusual loss of weight.

2373
02:22:20,198 --> 02:22:21,529
Enlargement...

2374
02:22:21,900 --> 02:22:23,868
Save me Raja, you're my god.

2375
02:22:24,636 --> 02:22:25,227
...of glands.

2376
02:22:26,971 --> 02:22:28,336
Raja, right, go ahead.

2377
02:22:28,673 --> 02:22:30,368
Swami, shut up and sit down.

2378
02:22:30,575 --> 02:22:33,510
Raja, go ahead.

2379
02:22:34,646 --> 02:22:39,606
l know it's effects l've
seen them just now.

2380
02:22:39,851 --> 02:22:44,345
l don't know the effect of all the
cancer in the world.

2381
02:22:44,722 --> 02:22:46,986
Raja, you started well. Go ahead.

2382
02:22:47,191 --> 02:22:48,852
Will you please stop it?

2383
02:22:49,060 --> 02:22:53,963
Leave it man.
What am l going to do by winning in it?

2384
02:22:55,099 --> 02:22:57,465
We've lost in what we had to win.

2385
02:22:58,937 --> 02:23:00,871
Even if you ask questions to the
one who doesn't know the answer,

2386
02:23:02,040 --> 02:23:04,270
he'll find out and
give a wrong answer at least.

2387
02:23:04,475 --> 02:23:05,703
l don't know the question itself.

2388
02:23:07,011 --> 02:23:08,444
l'm nothing.

2389
02:23:09,213 --> 02:23:11,181
Embracing therapy is
what my mother taught me.

2390
02:23:11,382 --> 02:23:13,043
Anybody can do that to anybody.

2391
02:23:16,220 --> 02:23:18,848
l'm not Rajaraman, just Tenaliraman.

2392
02:23:21,225 --> 02:23:23,625
l'll tell you everything openly.

2393
02:23:25,296 --> 02:23:31,792
l'm a rowdy.
Just collection Raja.

2394
02:23:33,338 --> 02:23:39,208
l cheated and joined this college.

2395
02:23:40,011 --> 02:23:42,138
l agree that was wrong.

2396
02:23:43,348 --> 02:23:45,077
You may wonder that
l've suddenly become good and,

2397
02:23:46,017 --> 02:23:48,315
accepting all my mistakes?

2398
02:23:48,519 --> 02:23:49,816
l've not turned honest suddenly.

2399
02:23:54,926 --> 02:23:55,551
Yesterday.

2400
02:23:58,096 --> 02:23:58,562
Sorry.

2401
02:24:03,468 --> 02:24:05,629
Zakir died in my hands yesterday.

2402
02:24:08,039 --> 02:24:09,233
l was helpless.

2403
02:24:13,378 --> 02:24:17,712
He didn't consider me even as doctor.
He considered me as God.

2404
02:24:18,483 --> 02:24:20,041
Do you know why l'm crying.

2405
02:24:20,551 --> 02:24:21,950
l had breached his trust.

2406
02:24:23,388 --> 02:24:26,357
l didn't breach anybody's trust
when l was a rowdy.

2407
02:24:28,092 --> 02:24:29,684
lf l had promised to collect,

2408
02:24:30,028 --> 02:24:32,019
l would promptly collect and hand it over
on that specific date.

2409
02:24:32,764 --> 02:24:34,994
l was helpless in this case.
That's why l couldn't.

2410
02:24:37,435 --> 02:24:41,371
lf l had saved him for some more time.

2411
02:24:41,572 --> 02:24:44,632
His mother would've seen him.

2412
02:24:46,210 --> 02:24:48,178
When l couldn't do that,
what if l be a rowdy or doctor.

2413
02:24:49,814 --> 02:24:52,647
Uncle, you're very clever.

2414
02:24:54,085 --> 02:24:57,020
Not only my father,
you made me also cry publicly.

2415
02:24:57,822 --> 02:25:01,189
You've won. l've lost, okay.

2416
02:25:02,060 --> 02:25:05,188
A request of this loser to
the winner! Will you conceed it?

2417
02:25:06,664 --> 02:25:09,224
Zakir's mother will be
coming now by train.

2418
02:25:10,168 --> 02:25:16,869
Don't trouble her by asking her to
observe all the formalities to take his body.

2419
02:25:18,609 --> 02:25:21,942
So sad! They'll pester her for bribe.

2420
02:25:22,680 --> 02:25:24,409
Without troubling her,
handover his body.

2421
02:25:24,849 --> 02:25:26,282
She may have to perform
many rites.

2422
02:25:27,118 --> 02:25:29,245
lt'll be helpful if
you do this for me.

2423
02:25:29,554 --> 02:25:31,749
Do you know how
l'm going to help you.

2424
02:25:32,523 --> 02:25:33,751
l'm leaving this college.

2425
02:25:34,459 --> 02:25:35,858
Go alone and laugh as much as
you like.

2426
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:38,458
That's all. Thanks a lot.

2427
02:25:55,480 --> 02:25:57,778
That's it. lt's over.

2428
02:25:58,483 --> 02:26:00,314
Hereafter we won't have his trouble.

2429
02:26:01,853 --> 02:26:02,820
Get back to your business.

2430
02:27:12,223 --> 02:27:16,353
Congratulations daddy.
You've won. Congrats.

2431
02:27:17,094 --> 02:27:22,691
As you wished, there'll be discipline,
dignity and decorum here.

2432
02:27:23,201 --> 02:27:24,566
Nobody will embrace anybody here.

2433
02:27:25,269 --> 02:27:26,861
Nobody will sing, dance.

2434
02:27:27,939 --> 02:27:29,600
No patients will have a smiling face.

2435
02:27:30,541 --> 02:27:31,667
That's what you want, isn't it daddy?

2436
02:27:33,945 --> 02:27:35,344
When there are so much
of medicines etc.

2437
02:27:35,813 --> 02:27:38,941
How dare he cured a patient
by playing carom board.

2438
02:27:40,017 --> 02:27:41,712
How can we permit that?

2439
02:27:42,753 --> 02:27:45,221
Atrocious! Meddler.

2440
02:27:46,657 --> 02:27:47,555
Patients who are counting their days.

2441
02:27:47,758 --> 02:27:49,385
Making them happy by singing songs.

2442
02:27:50,761 --> 02:27:52,592
How could we remain silent
after seeing it.

2443
02:27:54,065 --> 02:27:56,033
lf he embraces everybody foolishly.

2444
02:27:56,367 --> 02:27:57,129
Does that mean we've to allow it?

2445
02:27:57,501 --> 02:27:58,832
Hell with this embracing therapy.

2446
02:27:59,036 --> 02:28:00,469
Shouldn't we jail such a person?

2447
02:28:01,072 --> 02:28:05,634
Look...Anandan who was sleeping
peacefully for 12 years.

2448
02:28:05,843 --> 02:28:06,366
He has woken him up.

2449
02:28:07,011 --> 02:28:07,568
Oh god!

2450
02:28:08,079 --> 02:28:12,175
lf we've love, affection
and if we care for the patient,

2451
02:28:12,383 --> 02:28:14,647
did you see it's consequences?

2452
02:28:15,987 --> 02:28:20,048
Such miracles will not take
place in this hospital anymore.

2453
02:28:20,391 --> 02:28:20,857
Never...

2454
02:28:21,692 --> 02:28:22,920
You'll not allow it to happen.

2455
02:28:23,628 --> 02:28:25,391
You've won daddy congrats.

2456
02:28:52,189 --> 02:28:54,885
Not only you were in coma, me too.

2457
02:28:57,528 --> 02:28:59,462
Now, l've also awakened.

2458
02:29:00,698 --> 02:29:01,164
Thank you.

2459
02:29:08,072 --> 02:29:11,508
l don't think this will work out.
l'm planing to do my old business.

2460
02:29:11,709 --> 02:29:12,334
Collection?

2461
02:29:12,743 --> 02:29:13,209
No..

2462
02:29:13,411 --> 02:29:16,903
Decided to go back to my village
as a son of my father.

2463
02:29:17,648 --> 02:29:20,674
l don't know why l remember
my mother a lot now.

2464
02:29:21,552 --> 02:29:23,281
Brother, you remembered
mother, didn't you?

2465
02:29:23,487 --> 02:29:24,545
Look here.- What?

2466
02:29:27,525 --> 02:29:27,991
Mother..

2467
02:29:28,859 --> 02:29:29,985
ls this the time to
come back home?

2468
02:29:30,995 --> 02:29:32,189
Where were you both roaming?

2469
02:29:41,038 --> 02:29:43,370
Why have you bowed your head?

2470
02:29:44,976 --> 02:29:47,342
Don't know how to seek pardon?

2471
02:29:47,979 --> 02:29:50,948
Hey, l've to seek your
pardon justifiably.

2472
02:29:51,749 --> 02:29:56,413
l bravely left that day
declaring that you're not my son.

2473
02:29:57,154 --> 02:30:03,582
Today l'm chasing all the passers by and
telling them proudly that you're my son.

2474
02:30:03,794 --> 02:30:06,592
Still, l couldn't become a doctor.

2475
02:30:06,797 --> 02:30:08,059
What are you going to do
after becoming a doctor.

2476
02:30:08,566 --> 02:30:10,591
You'll give medicines, won't you?

2477
02:30:11,002 --> 02:30:13,368
Can you give new life
to other's as you do now?

2478
02:30:14,038 --> 02:30:16,029
As soon as l talked about new life,
l remembered one thing.

2479
02:30:16,307 --> 02:30:17,103
What's her name?

2480
02:30:18,175 --> 02:30:21,167
Pappu is waiting upstairs
since a long time. Go and meet her.

2481
02:30:21,379 --> 02:30:22,403
Why did she come here?

2482
02:30:22,613 --> 02:30:24,240
She had brought us here.

2483
02:30:24,448 --> 02:30:28,248
Hey, you go and...
- You yourself go and...

2484
02:30:28,953 --> 02:30:32,855
Are you going or
shall l kick you.

2485
02:30:33,391 --> 02:30:35,416
Now do you understand,
how did l learn fighting?

2486
02:30:35,626 --> 02:30:36,092
Hey, go.

2487
02:30:48,305 --> 02:30:53,436
Pappu, how are you?- l'm fine.

2488
02:30:57,481 --> 02:30:58,778
lt seems you want to meet me.

2489
02:30:59,250 --> 02:31:02,686
That's...nobody is marrying me.

2490
02:31:03,254 --> 02:31:06,985
Look, l dress up decently nowadays.
Then, too nobody believes.

2491
02:31:07,758 --> 02:31:08,782
Can you marry me?

2492
02:31:09,427 --> 02:31:18,062
Oh god. That's not possible.
l love somebody.- Who?

2493
02:31:19,570 --> 02:31:23,336
The person whom you know.
Your friend Janaki.

2494
02:31:23,774 --> 02:31:26,971
ls it? Then marry Janaki.
Okay by me.

2495
02:31:28,646 --> 02:31:30,204
You became Janaki
as soon as you turned.

2496
02:31:30,748 --> 02:31:32,045
That time also l was Janaki.

2497
02:31:32,516 --> 02:31:34,484
Now tell me, whom do you want to marry?

2498
02:31:34,885 --> 02:31:36,250
l'm Pappu as well as Janaki.

2499
02:31:37,655 --> 02:31:39,418
Put your finger down please.

2500
02:31:40,191 --> 02:31:41,886
Which finger?- This one.

2501
02:31:44,795 --> 02:31:45,955
Tensed?

2502
02:31:47,832 --> 02:31:48,491
Why are you asking?

2503
02:31:49,133 --> 02:31:51,533
To give you embracing therapy.

2504
02:31:52,369 --> 02:31:54,132
Then l'm very very tensed.

2505
02:31:59,210 --> 02:32:01,770
<i>Tell a number out of 1 0.</i>

2506
02:32:02,880 --> 02:32:06,111
<i>l'll tell you who's in my heart.</i>

2507
02:32:07,451 --> 02:32:10,284
<i>Tell a number out of 1 0.</i>

2508
02:32:11,255 --> 02:32:14,520
<i>l'll tell you who's in my heart.</i>

2509
02:32:15,826 --> 02:32:19,762
<i>You say 7, he's my 7 notes.</i>

2510
02:32:19,997 --> 02:32:23,797
<i>He has come to rule me for 7 births.</i>

2511
02:32:24,001 --> 02:32:28,335
<i>Who else is he?</i>
<i>Look at the mirror.</i>

2512
02:32:28,539 --> 02:32:31,235
<i>Tell a number out of 1 0.</i>

2513
