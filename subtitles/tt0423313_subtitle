1
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:27,054
This beautiful valley,
these snow-born peaks..

2
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:33,000
..are the borders of the nation
that the world calls India.

3
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:41,068
After this border begins the
border of those nations..

4
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:47,082
..whose greed penetrates into
ours and crosses its limits.

5
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,084
They wish to colour the
ground of India red..

6
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:53,019
..with the blood of
Indians themselves..

7
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:57,218
..and shatter India into
a million pieces.

8
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:04,229
Such a nation is Dongri-La,
which was once..

9
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:09,567
..made prosperous by India
itself, nurtured and nourished.

10
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:14,443
Today it has a dictator,
General Dong..

11
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,582
..who has become an
enemy of India.

12
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:23,919
Just a few days back, in order
to renew that enmity..

13
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:30,585
..he had sent a troop of
2000 trained militants.

14
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,397
But before they could put their
devious feet on our soil..

15
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:42,598
..our Indian soldiers
annihilated them.

16
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:50,611
But the commander of those
militants managed to save..

17
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,947
..himself somehow and
at this moment..

18
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,347
..he is going back to
his country Dongri-La.

19
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,246
Long live Dong!

20
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,974
Welcome to Dongri-La, Mr.
Commander. - Thank you.

21
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,450
And congratulations, you
escaped the clutches of death.

22
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,920
General Dong is awaiting
you. Make haste.

23
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,319
You are already 30 seconds late.

24
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,337
Long live Dong!

25
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,200
How are you Jhalu?

26
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,340
Fine, thank you. Hurry up sir.
You are already 40 seconds late.

27
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:51,474
40 seconds?

28
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,877
Mr. D'Costa, you are
extremely lucky.

29
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,277
You have saved your life
for the second time.

30
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,416
Second time?

31
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,552
Because you are just
59 seconds late.

32
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,022
If you were late by
1 minute more..

33
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,554
..we had order to shoot you.

34
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:17,028
Better relax now. General
Dong is waiting for you..

35
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,355
..in Rangshala.

36
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:25,539
God may be wrong, but Dong
can never be wrong.

37
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,020
Come on, come, come--.

38
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,889
See what all we have
made for you.

39
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:39,029
You must have got the habit
of eating Indian food..

40
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,028
..as you have drunk
the water there.

41
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,396
See, we have made Indian
food for you.

42
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:49,165
Look at these puri, rasgulla,
gulab jamun, jalebi, laddoo..

43
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:54,038
lmarti? Where is the imarti?

44
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,248
Here it comes.

45
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,906
Seen the imarti?
- Yes sir.

46
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:01,985
How delicious the imarti is
that's prepared for you!

47
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,119
Sit.
- Me, sir?

48
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,254
Yes, yes, sit.

49
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,352
What all happened there?

50
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,520
General, as soon as
we entered Kashmir..

51
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,398
..the Indian army ambushed
us and at the orders of..

52
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,866
..General Sinha all the
soldiers were shot.

53
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:27,000
On General Sinha's orders, all
soldiers were shot! - Yes, sir.

54
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,010
We prepare each of these
soldiers with so much effort..

55
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:34,549
..and on General Sinha's
orders all were shot.

56
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,023
But General, the top secret
file that I had taken with me..

57
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,021
..which contains the names of
all our agents in lndia..

58
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,558
..l did not let that file
fall into their hands.

59
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:50,296
Secret file! For this job,
you should get a reward.

60
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:54,302
A promotion! A promotion! You
are dismissed from the post..

61
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,964
..of Dongri-La's Secret
Force Chief.

62
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,575
Sit down, sit down.

63
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:05,243
You will be the made the
Home Minister here.

64
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,918
Hey, Home Minister. Salute!

65
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,182
Thank you, general.
Thank you very much.

66
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:19,592
I forgot. The food, the
food is waiting for you.

67
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:33,601
Wait, a big mistake was to
be committed! A great sin!

68
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:41,274
This food is not for you.
This is for the Brahmins.

69
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:52,019
Today is your mourning feast.
Mourning feast.

70
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,963
People celebrate the mourning
feast after death.

71
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:04,098
We are celebrating yours
one day before death.

72
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,367
General, l..

73
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:32,263
Mr. D'Costa, tomorrow is
Dongri-La's annual day.

74
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:36,464
There in front of all,
you'll commit suicide.

75
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,269
Long live Dong!

76
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:47,607
Dong is never wrong.

77
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,563
No, you cannot leave us and go.

78
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:08,027
Ladies and gentlemen, as
you know, the greatest..

79
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:11,573
..reward of Dongri-La
is the Gun of Honour.

80
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:17,036
And this year, the recipient
of this honour..

81
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,911
..is our new Home Minister,
Mr. Wilson D'Costa.

82
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:41,001
Jenny, Jenny, promise me that
you'll make my son a soldier.

83
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,404
Not Dong's soldier, but
a soldier of Dongri-La.

84
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:04,551
Promise me. This photo.
Okay soldier, bye.

85
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,587
This Gun of Honour is the
privilege of that soldier..

86
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,328
..who brings glory to
Dongri-La, or of he who..

87
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:49,599
..gives up his life for
the honour of Dongri-La.

88
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:55,442
I give my life not to the king,
but for the honour of Dongri-La.

89
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,187
Your husband had definitely
forgotten the duty of a soldier..

90
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,195
..while dying because he had
anger in his eyes for me.

91
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:52,996
But I am General Dong. I
shall not forget my duty.

92
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:56,139
I will respect the widow
of my soldier.

93
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:59,333
I will avenge the death
of your husband.

94
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:04,879
Let this message be sent to
General Sinha of India.

95
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,010
So General Dong has sent
me the message that..

96
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,883
..our Army Annual Day will
be the last day of my life!

97
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,023
Read that again, Mr. lyengar.

98
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:21,095
General Sinha, if you wanted,
you could have arrested..

99
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,893
..those 2000 soldiers
of mine. But no!

100
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:27,560
In order to become a national
hero, you gunned them down.

101
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,041
l, being the leader of
Dongri-La, am coming there myself..

102
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:34,905
..to pay tribute to those
2000 soldiers of mine.

103
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:40,039
I will be there to terminate you
in front of your own soldiers..

104
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,378
..on the Annual Day
at precisely 8:30.

105
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,317
Nonsense, absolutely nonsense.

106
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:46,455
General, I suggest that..

107
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,924
That I get scared of Dong's
threat, not go to the parade..

108
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,324
..and break an age-old
tradition of this country.

109
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,329
Not just your life, sir, but
the pride of the whole nation..

110
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:57,466
..is at stake.

111
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,261
What if something happens
to you, sir?

112
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,335
Then what?

113
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:01,869
Then what? There will be
one more assassination.

114
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:06,999
But this time, this country and
the 80 crore people in it..

115
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,941
..may be aroused
of their slumber.

116
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:15,014
Perhaps, this time we shall
answer their havoc with ours.

117
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,020
I'll go to the parade.

118
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,156
Sir.

119
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,019
Already it is 8:25. I think
it is a blank threat.

120
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:25,417
Nothing can be said. The man
is from Dongri-La. Be alert.

121
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,219
Yes, yes, yes, hold.
I am sending him.

122
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,225
Go to south belt, south belt.
- Yes.

123
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,230
Hold it there, hold it!

124
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,969
How did you dare to come here?

125
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,918
Dong is never wrong.
You are wrong.

126
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,023
I am not the real,
but the fake Dong.

127
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,524
That is the real Dong.

128
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,026
I too am not the real Dong.

129
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,195
Then where is the real one?

130
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,274
See there.

131
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,214
Aren't you trapped
in Dong's web?

132
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:28,010
You are all fools. Running
hither-thither.

133
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,949
The real Dong is there
on the parade ground.

134
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,011
Sir, welcome home. Even after
living for 11 years in America..

135
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,208
..there is no change in you.
Looking same as ever.

136
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,618
I am not a thing
that can change.

137
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:50,093
I am a man, not a shirt.

138
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,452
Krishna my boy,
come in, come in.

139
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,621
Meet our defence secretary
Mr. lyengar.

140
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:59,500
Mr. lyengar, this is Major
Krishna Rao. The one and only.

141
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,103
Yes, yes. Who doesn't know him?

142
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,035
The recipient of the
Param Veer Charkra..

143
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,173
"Major Krishna Rao.

144
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,172
My boy, is everything all
right? What was the urgency..

145
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,366
..that you wanted to meet me?

146
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,376
Sir, I have heard that to
finish Dong and his soldiers..

147
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:13,209
..you are dispatching
a mission to Dongri-La.

148
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,050
That is right.

149
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,416
Well, because of diplomatic
angles, we cannot..

150
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:23,048
..attack Dongri-La. And in its
populace, there are lndians..

151
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,058
..also in large numbers.
To kill one Dong..

152
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,255
..we cannot kill thousands
of our Indian brothers.

153
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,591
But even then, we have to
avenge the death of General Sinha.

154
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:36,470
Sir, then give me the
responsibility of this mission.

155
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,403
Talk practically, Krishna Rao.
You cannot be given..

156
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,338
..this responsibility under
any circumstances..

157
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,274
..and you know it. Your
transfer has been done..

158
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,606
..to the peace centre.
Go and take charge.

159
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,013
Please try to understand
me, sir.

160
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,411
You know that killing Dong
is the aim of my life.

161
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:56,024
In the past eleven months in
America, if I have thought..

162
00:21:56,181 --> 00:22:00,095
"anything, then it is about
how to reach Dongri-La.

163
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,360
Today I have only
one month left.

164
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:08,904
I know, I know, my boy. But I
have some restrictions also.

165
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,234
I can't.. I can't give
you this permission.

166
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:16,243
Please, sir. You have given
me all these medals..

167
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:20,178
..for my heroisms. Today in
the name of these medals..

168
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,582
..l seek permission
from you, sir.

169
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:32,456
You will hear of Dong's
death from Dongri-La..

170
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,259
..whether Major Krishna
Rao returns alive or not.

171
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,458
You are wasting my time,
Major Krishna Rao.

172
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:41,433
We've to go to a conference.
Please excuse me.

173
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:47,441
So excuse me, sir. Do not
think that Krishna Rao..

174
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:52,275
..is so weak that he cannot
go to Dongri-La on his own.

175
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:57,087
<i>Krishna Rae can give his
resignation here..</i>

176
00:22:57,242 --> 00:23:00,018
..and before you send your
mission he can reach there..

177
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,351
..and he can kill Dong also.
If that happens..

178
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:10,164
..then with Dong, once again
will perish the pride..

179
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:14,896
..of Indian soldiers.
Therefore, give the permission, sir.

180
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:20,442
Dong has killed a soldier
of the Indian army.

181
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:25,173
Therefore, his death shouldn't
be at the hands of..

182
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,408
..any Krishna Rao, but at the
hands of an Indian soldier.

183
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,573
But..

184
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,054
I haven't asked anything
for my selfish means..

185
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:37,592
--I've only asked for the pride
of my nation, not for a throne-.

186
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,065
This is my plan, sir.

187
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,607
So, you have a team also?

188
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,078
Yes sir, one of them is from
the Tibetan border force..

189
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:58,214
..Himalayan range expert
Black cat commander..

190
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,146
..Anju Sinha, and the other
three are from the..

191
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,284
..army intelligence.

192
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:07,289
Who are they?

193
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,451
Hey friends, these girls!

194
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,420
Before Major Krishna
Rao's orders come..

195
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,992
..let us bathe in the Ganges.

196
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,323
What Ganges? I am prepared to
bathe in the Jamuna also.

197
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:51,263
But brother, this time
is only for the girls.

198
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:54,131
Brother, I have the
remedy for this.

199
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,430
These beautiful girls!

200
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:45,120
Hello!

201
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:49,248
Hello, how are you? Are
you from Switzerland?

202
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,917
No, I am from Mudh Island.

203
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,256
Oh, Mudh Island.

204
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:58,925
Boys don't come here, do they?
- Boys?

205
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,003
Yes, I am very scared of boys.

206
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,332
Scared?

207
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:06,533
Yes, you know, uncle, boys
are very aggressive.

208
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,204
They are loafers!

209
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:13,076
Sweethearts, there is no need
to be scared of boys.

210
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,876
Boys are good. You
meet them everyday.

211
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,281
How sweet! How interesting!

212
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:20,013
May we go now?

213
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,559
Hi girls!

214
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,051
Hi everybody!

215
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,060
Come on, have fun with us.

216
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,562
We have come for that only.

217
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,160
But I do not know how to swim.

218
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,895
If I drown, I'll die unmarried.

219
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,031
No, we'll not allow you
to drown. Come on, now.

220
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:52,054
What an item this is!
What quantity!

221
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,125
What has happened to
your eyes suddenly!

222
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,922
The heat! The heat!
The heat of youth!

223
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:04,534
Really, I'll get a hero?
But where will I get him?

224
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,003
This is a forecast from
the lovers' radio-.

225
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,001
This is a forecast from
the lovers' radio-.

226
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,003
Today the weather
will be colourful.

227
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,142
It will be a monsoon of love.
The girl who will go alone..

228
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:18,270
--In the lovers' park will get
her hero there- You'll go?

229
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,346
Yes. But what will I tell?

230
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:23,042
You won't have to tell.
He'll tell.

231
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,551
But what?

232
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,939
Under my umbrella..

233
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:22,544
Come under my umbrella..

234
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:26,208
<i>Why do you get wet, Kama?</i>

235
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,020
Under my umbrella..

236
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,383
Come under my umbrella..

237
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,389
Why do you get wet, Bimla?

238
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,360
Under my umbrella..

239
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,965
Come under my umbrella..

240
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,966
Why do you get wet, Salma?

241
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:53,304
Come, settle in my heart.

242
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:56,412
What are you thinking there?

243
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,911
Come under my umbrella..

244
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,315
<i>Why getting wet, Kama?</i>

245
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:08,185
Why getting wet, Bimla?

246
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:10,917
Why getting wet, Salma?

247
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:44,887
Hey girl, why are
you going there?

248
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:47,029
Come here.

249
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,892
Are you coming, or
should I go there?

250
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:06,572
You are a Marathi girl like
a serpent wet in the tide.

251
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:14,250
You are a Marathi girl like
a serpent wet in the tide.

252
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:19,418
I am your snake-charmer,
I shall hold your dress.

253
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:25,330
I am your snake-charmer,
I shall hold your dress.

254
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:31,073
I'll play the music
of the heart..

255
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:34,005
You dance again and again.

256
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,081
Under my umbrella..

257
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,274
Come under my umbrella..

258
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:42,941
<i>Why getting wet, Kama?</i>

259
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,945
Why getting wet, Bimla?

260
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,955
Why getting wet, Salma?

261
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:06,569
It is morning; give me
something in the name of Allah.

262
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,569
Give me two ripe mangoes;
take five ripe ones.

263
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:18,316
This is give and take. You
also give me something.

264
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:22,049
Give, take.. give, take..

265
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:37,403
God will look after you;
he'll fill your womb.

266
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:45,206
God will look after you;
he'll fill your womb.

267
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:50,217
If you give us little; God
will give you much more.

268
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:55,222
If you give us little; God
will give you much more.

269
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,562
These blind..

270
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:04,556
Give charity to these blind,
you have lot of wealth.

271
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,235
Come under my umbrella..

272
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,169
<i>Why are you getting
wet, Karma?</i>

273
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,265
Come inside my hut..

274
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,931
Why are you running like this?

275
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,940
Come inside my hut..

276
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:50,943
Why are you running like this?

277
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:17,232
Brother, till when will you
keep doodling like this on paper?

278
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:20,372
Saying 'Your chapeau,
your spectacles'?

279
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:26,573
Allah has not made such a
girl for you till today.

280
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:31,247
If God has given me
the imagination..

281
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:37,587
..then see, one day I shall
get my flower amidst flowers.

282
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,255
Allah forbid!

283
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,456
Your face is ungainly; at
least speak nice things.

284
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:49,598
It may not be good to hear,
but it is true.

285
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,607
I do not see your mission
getting accomplished.

286
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,600
What are you telling?

287
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,080
Pardon my impudence, sir.
But aren't you going with..

288
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,341
..Major Krishna Rao to
Dongri-La on a secret mission?

289
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:06,085
But you won't be
able to go, sir?

290
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,416
Why?

291
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,556
Those going to Dongri-La
will now go to Death.

292
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:31,236
You have shot a lot of bullets;
now loosen your tongue also.

293
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:32,567
Who has sent you?

294
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,168
Me!

295
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:51,389
She is threatening us.

296
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,257
Whether you are capable of
going to Dongri-La or not..

297
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:59,128
Hence, on the orders
of General Kapoor..

298
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,200
..we came to test you.

299
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,065
That old man does not
even understand that..

300
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:04,001
..negative to positive,
positive to negative..

301
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,005
..east to west, west to east,
female to male..

302
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,872
..should not be sent. That
brings a danger of short circuit.

303
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:10,068
What does that mean?

304
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:12,077
I'll explain the meaning.

305
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:18,551
It means that he is my elder
brother, and he is my younger..

306
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:20,283
..but I am of your age.

307
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:22,390
And it's his season nowadays.

308
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,549
Season? What do you mean?

309
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:28,553
When it is my season, heat
is generated within me.

310
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:31,556
..and when heat is generated, I
begin to sniff nice fragrances..

311
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:35,367
..and when I sniff nice
fragrances, my pulse rises..

312
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:39,906
..and when my pulse rises,
my eye begins to flap..

313
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:45,241
..and when my eyes begin to
flap, I feel like kissing someone.

314
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:49,112
Shut up! If you come ahead
even one more step..

315
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:52,117
..then your libido will be
the cause of your death.

316
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:54,051
I am Black Cat Commando
from the Tibetan Force..

317
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,589
..Captain Anju Sinha.

318
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,925
And I am Allah Rakha.

319
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:01,997
Okay now, move, will you? Mr.
Kapoor and Mr. Rao..

320
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:03,188
..are waiting for you.

321
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,356
Where are you going?
What about my kiss?

322
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:08,527
You take it later with fun.

323
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,538
Allah forbid!

324
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:15,009
Hello, Dongri-La, Prince Kao..

325
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:27,545
I see.. I see. Good, very
good. Great! Great!

326
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,154
Finito.. finish!

327
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:40,558
Captain Chauhan, courage.

328
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,040
Captain Rakesh, determination

329
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:48,973
Captain Javed, intelligence.

330
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:54,572
Captain Anju Sinha, strategy.
Very good.

331
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,187
Major Krishna Rao, you
have the perfect team.

332
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:00,117
And thanks to Defence
Secretary Mr. lyengar..

333
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,349
..you have the permission
of the ministry also.

334
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:09,260
But this permission means only
that if it is successful..

335
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,058
..then it is the victory of
the Indian government..

336
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:15,534
..of the Indian people
and the Indian army..

337
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:19,030
..and if this mission
is unsuccessful..

338
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:25,545
..then it will be your, your,
your, your and your defeat..

339
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,375
..the government will not
be involved in this.

340
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:33,386
To prove Dong wrong,
on the Annual Day..

341
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:37,549
..Force Five is coming
from India?

342
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:44,397
Seal all borders of Dongri-La
and keep strict vigil".

343
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:49,561
..on all the airports. Please
sit down, sit down, sit down.

344
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:56,105
Under any circumstances,
I need to send..

345
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:59,976
..50000 infiltrators and 5000
human bombs to lndia..

346
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:04,108
..after the snow melts. Begin
their training for that quickly.

347
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:05,515
Yes sir-.

348
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,981
Excuse me, general.
What is a human bomb?

349
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:11,182
I'll demonstrate it
to you, Colonel Jack.

350
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:17,527
Dong is your god. His voice
is the voice of your soul.

351
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:25,536
His order is your religion.
General Dong is your god.

352
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:34,278
Girls brought from the world
over are hypnotised here.

353
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,021
Whenever any of Dong's orders
fall on their ears..

354
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:44,888
..then they obey it
like a machine. Look.

355
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:55,431
Number 12, number
12, come forth.

356
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:58,039
Now go on that platform.

357
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:02,572
Good!

358
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,049
Tie that belt with the
bomb to your waist.

359
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,321
Now press the button
in front of the belt.

360
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:32,939
General Dong is your god.
These are my human bombs.

361
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:38,076
This is that part of
the Himalayan range..

362
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:39,441
..where the border of our
nation comes to an end.

363
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,446
This is China and
this is Pakistan.

364
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:45,348
And this is the danger valley.
No man's land.

365
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:48,080
You mean, Mount Xinjhang?
- Right.

366
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:52,284
And above this, here is
situated Dongri-La.

367
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,158
That means, we shall all
have to descend on..

368
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:58,095
..Mount Xinjhang with
the aid of parachutes?

369
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,233
No, that's out of the question.

370
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,166
There are cannons and radars
on Mount Xinjhang..

371
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:05,170
..which we cannot escape.
There is only one way out..

372
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:09,573
..and that is mountain trekking.
We shall go trekking from here.

373
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:15,039
But, this is impossible. Most
of the valley's cliffs are..

374
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,913
..snow-covered in these days.
In most of the areas..

375
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:20,055
..of the valley, there
is not even sunlight.

376
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:23,420
Okay, okay, don't get panicky.
We have provision for this.

377
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:28,063
There will be a man there
to give us light..

378
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:31,063
..who can see in darkness and
in find his path in snow.

379
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,257
Who's that?

380
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:36,064
The lion of the Himalayas,
Dharam Singh.

381
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:44,270
Major Dharam Singh? That
infamous Dharam Singh..

382
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:46,346
..who was court-martialled
and expelled from the army?

383
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:48,416
Yes.

384
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:51,348
That is impossible, sir.
Major Dharam Singh..

385
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:55,286
--Will not work for us-
He hates the Indian army-.

386
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:58,154
This is not possible, sir. He
was insulted and removed..

387
00:41:58,315 --> 00:41:59,293
..from the army.

388
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,554
Then buy him with money.

389
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:04,555
Now he's a professional
private detective.

390
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:07,035
This will also be
difficult. Sir,

391
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,568
his way of working is different.

392
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:10,902
He works for six months
and loafs for six months.

393
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:14,042
When he loafs, there is
no wealth in the world..

394
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,575
..that can make him do any work.

395
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:18,444
This is his time for loafing.

396
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:23,051
I want him by all means.
If not by money or love..

397
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,051
..then overpower him
and bring him here.

398
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,188
I want him anyhow.

399
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:28,322
Okay, sir.

400
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,425
Impossible! I tell you
it is impossible.

401
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:37,999
Using strength, nobody can
take Dharam Singh with him.

402
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:39,259
What did you say?

403
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:43,132
I meant, brother, that you
can take him if you want.

404
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:44,272
Did you understand?

405
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:50,606
Then sir, you tell us, where is
this elder brother of ours now?

406
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:26,571
Give me some booze..

407
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:28,573
Call some girl..

408
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:31,246
Drop the curtains..

409
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:33,581
Turn off the lights..

410
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:43,429
Put the anklets on my feet
and watch my drama.

411
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:48,428
Put the anklets on my feet
and watch my drama.

412
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:53,337
Put the anklets on my feet
and watch my drama.

413
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:58,273
Put the anklets on my feet
and watch my drama.

414
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:03,280
I will dance and sing; there
will be chaos here.

415
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,283
I am the sizzling Dharam,
I have no shame!

416
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:07,547
I am the sizzling Dharam,
I have no shame!

417
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:17,961
Put the anklets on my feet
and watch my drama.

418
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:23,231
I will dance and sing; there
will be chaos here.

419
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:32,036
I am the sizzling Dharam,
I have no shame!

420
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:36,912
I am the sizzling Dharam,
I have no shame!

421
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:45,924
Number fifty four..

422
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:47,926
House with the bamboo door..

423
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:50,588
Bamboo roof and a bamboo top..

424
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,590
Bamboo roof and a bamboo top..

425
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:55,070
The ceiling's got
a bamboo floor.

426
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:57,262
Number fifty four..

427
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,954
One two three-- four 0'
clock-- rock rock rock--.

428
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:17,387
..around the clock.

429
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,392
One two three-- four 0'
clock-- rock rock rock--.

430
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,552
..around the clock.

431
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,032
I will dance and
you will dance.

432
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,396
The whole world will dance.

433
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,234
I am the sizzling Dharam,
I have no shame!

434
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:38,376
I am the sizzling Dharam,
I have no shame!

435
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,214
I rule even today.

436
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:25,087
I speak to the angels.

437
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:31,021
See. I proclaim war,
I will show the world.

438
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:35,967
Even we know it, nobody
has won against you.

439
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:40,575
See. I proclaim war,
I will show the world.

440
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:45,410
Even we know it, nobody
has won against you.

441
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:48,413
Whether it is twenty, thirty,
forty or fifty,

442
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:50,574
I am not lesser to anyone.

443
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:54,385
I am the sizzling Dharam,
I have no shame!

444
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:59,392
I am the sizzling Dharam,
I have no shame!

445
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:04,525
Put the anklets on my feet
and watch my drama.

446
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:14,999
I will dance and sing; there
will be chaos here.

447
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,942
I am the sizzling Dharam,
I have no shame!

448
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:23,949
I am the sizzling Dharam,
I have no shame!

449
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:47,033
Why are you people
wasting your time?

450
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:51,046
I will tell you finally.
I have no interest..

451
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,044
..in your mission
and your money.

452
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,046
Just leave and please
leave me alone.

453
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,183
Just a minute.

454
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:58,385
We agree that we cannot incite..

455
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,988
..you with money during
your rest period.

456
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:05,991
Will you come with us according
to your own free will..

457
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:08,527
..or should we take you there
under the army rules?

458
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:16,061
Well, the army rules
can take me there..

459
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:20,072
But it cannot put anything
in my mind and soul.

460
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,211
I will have you trapped
in the Danger valley..

461
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:25,074
..in such a way, you will
have proper amnesia.

462
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,010
You will forget everything
about yourself.

463
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,548
We know it. And therefore, we
are being patient with you.

464
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,542
The army needs you today.

465
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:38,384
What nonsense? The army
needs me today?

466
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:42,052
This Dharam Singh. This
undisciplined major Dharam Singh.

467
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:47,433
I was insulted and chucked
out of the army.

468
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,231
Brother.. please forget
all that now..

469
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:53,307
Forget it?

470
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:57,238
Should I forget that bitterness?

471
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:01,041
It is easy for you to say so.

472
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,250
How can I forget it?

473
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:08,256
This good for nothing drunkard..

474
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:10,392
How can I forget that Indian
army had capable officers.

475
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:15,326
He had some dreams
about the army too.

476
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:19,524
He had dreams. He wanted
a house and family.

477
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,134
Those dreams, now shattered,
are piercing my soul..

478
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:26,331
..they are ripping apart
my very veins.

479
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:31,539
Before the spark of anger
that is in my chest..

480
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:34,879
..explodes like a volcano, you
go from here. Get out from here.

481
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:53,031
Today's news, today's news..
The soldier who killed..

482
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,033
..thousands of the enemy,
Major Dharam Singh..

483
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:56,569
..is court-martialled. Major
Dharam Singh is court-martialled.

484
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,563
Major Dharam Singh is
court-martialled.

485
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,566
Major Dharam Singh is
court-martialled.

486
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:03,066
Major Dharam Singh is
court-martialled.

487
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:16,118
The lion of the Himalayan
ranges, the winner of the..

488
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:18,259
..Mahavir Chakra Award,
IC number 7986F..

489
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:22,989
..Major Dharam Singh, the
allegation upon you is that..

490
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:27,602
..on 4 January 1982 you refused
to obey the orders..

491
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:29,069
..of your senior officer
Briagdier Kapoor..

492
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:34,073
..and without any permission,
you attacked the enemy..

493
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:38,077
..infiltrators at Karimulla
sector in Kashipur..

494
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:41,079
..even when the responsibility
of this was not in the hands..

495
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:43,411
..of the army but of the
police of that area.

496
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:47,282
Major Dharam Singh, do you have
to say anything about this?

497
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:53,019
Being a soldier, I am
also a citizen, sir.

498
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:59,623
If I had waited for the police
of Brigadier Kapoor..

499
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:03,038
..to thwart the attack
of those infiltrators..

500
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:06,037
..then I don't know how many
innocent people would have died.

501
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:09,040
And the responsibility of
those deaths would not..

502
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:12,305
..have been mine, nor yours,
nor Brigadier Kapoor's.

503
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,925
Major Dharam Singh, being
a civilian what you did..

504
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:32,432
..is praiseworthy. But the
foundation of the army is..

505
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:36,059
..on discipline. You've broken
the discipline of the army.

506
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:40,402
This court holds you guilty
and expels you from the..

507
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:45,070
--Indian army for ever-
That's all-.

508
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:58,082
Sir, one is not punished so
severely for taking a life..

509
00:51:58,248 --> 00:51:59,955
..as you have punished me for
saving thousands of lives.

510
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,961
This decision of yours has
shattered all the dreams..

511
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,567
..all the hopes of a soldier.
How easily you said..

512
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:11,028
..Mr. Judge that it cannot
be, that's all!

513
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:14,903
It cannot be, that's all!

514
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:25,576
Why did they do this with you?

515
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:28,920
Take it easy, Seema,
take it easy.

516
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:34,586
At this juncture of life, I
need you. I need your support.

517
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:44,929
Love? Support? I want to
give you so much love..

518
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:48,440
..as much as no one in this
world must have give to anyone.

519
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:54,071
But now this cannot happen.
It is not possible.

520
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:55,215
Seema?

521
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:59,212
Yes, Dharam Singh. My brother
and father are in the army.

522
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:02,379
All their dreams are
related to the army.

523
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:08,553
Will they permit me to marry
any court-martialled person?

524
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:13,095
Today a daughter is sacrificing
her love..

525
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:16,237
..for the sake of her
brother and her father.

526
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:22,373
Forgive me, if possible.
Please forgive me.

527
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:28,044
Neither did I get god,
nor my lover.

528
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:38,048
Dharam Singh, you can
shed your blood..

529
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:42,061
..in the memory of your
past bitterness..

530
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,062
..but you cannot wash away the
stains of court-martial..

531
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,427
..with this blood of yours.

532
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,070
Major, this is a very
good opportunity when..

533
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:52,469
..you can wash away those
satins. Just think.

534
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:55,405
When people will come to know
that despite so much..

535
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:58,273
..being done against you, you
have helped the army, then..

536
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:01,208
Okay, Dharam Singh,
tell us one thing.

537
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:07,010
Were you just a soldier of the
Indian army, not a citizen?

538
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:12,156
I just want to know, is Dharam
Singh only a soldier..

539
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:15,558
..of the Indian army? ls he
not a citizen along with it?

540
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:20,292
Has Dong shamed only the
Indian army by killing--.

541
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:23,904
..General Sinha, not
the entire nation?

542
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:27,041
By entering our country, these
infiltrators will cause havoc..

543
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:30,041
..will only the police be
responsible for that..

544
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,178
..not the army?

545
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:35,049
Dharam Singh, this struggle
is not only of the army..

546
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:36,240
..but of every Indian.

547
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:41,055
The responsibility of finishing
these infiltrators..

548
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:44,055
..is not only of the
army and the police..

549
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:45,192
..but of every citizen of India.

550
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:50,064
Big brother, not as soldiers
of the Indian army..

551
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,064
..but as citizens of India,
we beg you for your help.

552
00:54:54,157 --> 00:55:00,540
Sir, not as a Major, but as an
Indian citizen, I beg of you.

553
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,203
No!

554
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,279
No! It's enough.

555
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:10,550
What a destiny!

556
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:19,087
Today I have seen that
Dharam Singh in you..

557
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:24,892
..who was once an officer
in the army.

558
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:32,569
Okay, I'll take you there.
But I have one condition.

559
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:41,174
No commander, no officer
will order me.

560
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:48,420
I will do everything myself.
- Agreed.

561
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:13,146
Come.

562
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:17,208
Welcome, Major Dharam
Singh, I am..

563
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:21,083
Major Krishna Rao, commander
of Force Five..

564
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:22,279
..and you are Anju..
- Sinha!

565
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:24,091
Correct!

566
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:27,023
So how is life in Bangkok?
After discipline in the army..

567
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:30,289
..how do you like the life
of a private detective?

568
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:36,563
Life is to be lived, Major.
Make it as colourful as you want.

569
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,038
Well said, Major.

570
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:40,574
Where are you going?

571
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,568
She is angry. The matter
is hot, go on.

572
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:47,147
She is your sister-in-law.

573
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,916
Again I must say, Dharam
Singh, I am really..

574
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:55,056
..obliged to you. By your
joining this mission..

575
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:59,250
..l feel that we are
half successful.

576
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,397
Major, I have not joined
your mission.

577
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:06,193
I have promised to leave you
till the border of Dongri-La.

578
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:10,862
That much is enough for
us. Now what next?

579
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:15,999
This is the Danger
Valley and this is

580
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:18,544
..which opens up in
the mouth of death.

581
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:21,538
We will first cross
the Danger Valley.

582
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:28,953
After trekking for about 30 km,
we shall reach a region..

583
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,955
..where even the sunlight
doesn't reach.

584
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:54,468
The crazy heart yearned
for the beloved.

585
00:59:54,624 --> 01:00:00,097
The crazy heart yearned
for the beloved.

586
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:05,474
I colored..

587
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:11,142
I colored my veil saffron,
for my beloved.

588
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:16,416
The crazy heart yearned
for the beloved.

589
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:21,927
The crazy heart yearned
for the beloved.

590
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:27,330
I colored..

591
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:33,065
I colored my veil saffron,
for my love.

592
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:38,542
The crazy heart yearned
for the beloved.

593
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:44,276
The crazy heart yearned
for the beloved.

594
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:32,565
This love is a sickness, I
lost all my shame and shyness.

595
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:37,102
This love is a sickness, I
lost all my shame and shyness.

596
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:42,266
The whole world says
that I am crazy.

597
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:47,604
The whole world says
that I am crazy.

598
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:53,948
My body and soul..

599
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:59,685
My body and soul yearns
for my beloved.

600
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:09,167
The crazy heart yearned
for the beloved.

601
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:59,480
Whatever happened..
will not return.

602
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:04,887
Whatever happened..
will not return..

603
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:10,292
Nobody else will come in
this heart other than you.

604
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:18,565
Whatever happened..
will not return.

605
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:29,112
If you don't support me,
I know how to walk.

606
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:34,312
I know fire, I know
how to burn.

607
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:39,984
This life is a doll,
what if it burns?

608
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:45,258
This life is a doll,
what if it burns?

609
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:50,632
There will be no special
time to die too.

610
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:56,209
Whatever happened..
will not return.

611
01:03:56,365 --> 01:04:04,876
Nobody else will come in
this heart other than you.

612
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:10,115
Whatever happened..
will not return.

613
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:47,518
That is Dongri La's boundary.

614
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:49,418
Mount Jinjiyar.

615
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,120
The enemy and their
radars cannot..

616
01:05:57,687 --> 01:06:00,190
..thrust in the water
and reach us.

617
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:05,200
Therefore, we will have to go
up through this waterfall.

618
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:06,533
Okay.

619
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,144
Hold my hand..

620
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:45,469
Long live Dong!

621
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:49,371
Long live Dong!

622
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:56,173
You bloody Indians. Do you
think we are foolish like you?

623
01:07:56,338 --> 01:08:00,047
You thought that you will come
to Dongrila from this path?

624
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:02,849
And we will not find
it out too? Stupid!

625
01:08:05,214 --> 01:08:09,594
We have prepared this water
trap for fools like you.

626
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,929
Now, get ready to die.

627
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:31,448
Stop looking at me, damn it, I
am all right. Move.. move.. move..

628
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:07,147
Come on.

629
01:10:24,086 --> 01:10:26,191
This is..

630
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:28,266
Oh my.. oh my!

631
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:37,610
It bit me.. honey bee..
it bit me.. oh..

632
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:05,229
Sir.. give us your hand.. Come on..
come on.. major.. give us your hand..

633
01:11:06,395 --> 01:11:08,170
Careful
- Are you all right?

634
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:09,308
Yes, I am all right.

635
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:13,379
Captain, get the medical first
aid kit. - Yes, sir. - Okay.

636
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:18,577
Careful.
- Okay.

637
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:23,151
Sir, he is bleeding, sir.
- Give him an injection.

638
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:28,585
Don't panic.. don't worry.
Nothing will happen to me.

639
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,598
The one who has taken
wounds on his heart..

640
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:34,132
..what will happen to
them with this wound?

641
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:36,497
The one who has drunk
tears of blood..

642
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:41,005
..will he die of this blood?
- Tears of blood?

643
01:11:42,731 --> 01:11:47,942
Yes, major. I had a daughter.
Eleven months, fourteen days ago..

644
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:51,609
..l had taken her for a picnic
in the middle of the sea..

645
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:54,277
..at the country's boundary.

646
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:59,017
Papa, look at that.. it seems
that there is some island there.

647
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:04,395
Help me..

648
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:05,554
Shetty.
- Sir?

649
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:08,091
See that island?
- Sir.

650
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:09,292
Take us there.

651
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:28,485
Oh my god. She's dead.

652
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:30,922
Shetty.
- Yes, sir?

653
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:34,528
Take Dolly to the launch.
I will see in the jungle.

654
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:39,926
Sir, you have done
a good deed by..

655
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:42,091
..coming to this
desolate island.

656
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:44,464
It will be so easy to bring
girls here from all..

657
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:46,628
"places, like India, Pakistan
Bangladesh and Burma.

658
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:51,107
And sir, it can be turned into
a human bomb training center.

659
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:52,506
Sir, you will have to
come here regularly.

660
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:56,343
They are beautiful,
very beautiful.

661
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:59,952
Export them to Dongrila
and start training them.

662
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:04,290
How sweet. Send
her to our harem.

663
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:09,629
These girls seem
to be very weak.

664
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:12,430
Their faces are so pale.

665
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:15,068
We cannot have our commission
on selling them too.

666
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:19,969
Their eyes, kidneys and hearts.
Sell them in the markets.

667
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:22,234
But sir, what about their bones?

668
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,638
There are so many already.

669
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:29,243
Donate them to the
medical schools.

670
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:33,478
Hey, you illegitimate
son of Karna.

671
01:13:36,678 --> 01:13:38,055
What a donation.

672
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:43,928
Indian army major.

673
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:47,592
Krishnarao.

674
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:53,434
Krishna.. has come to save
the maidens from Kansa.

675
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:57,668
Dong, you think that
you are Kansa?

676
01:13:59,535 --> 01:14:01,606
People will laugh
if they hear it.

677
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:08,546
Kansa was evil and bad.
He wasn't a pimp.

678
01:14:10,045 --> 01:14:13,117
He didn't take the commission
of selling women.

679
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:17,228
He wasn't a butcher who
sold female flesh.

680
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:25,233
There are so many tyrants
in this world.

681
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:29,308
But no body has been
praised so much.

682
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:35,178
Did you see my patriotism? I
tolerate so much for Dongrila.

683
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:39,046
Dongrila.. for the people
of Dongrila.. to feed them.

684
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:43,088
God has given everyone two
hands to feed themselves, Dong.

685
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:46,992
You don't need those hands too.

686
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,526
Because the almighty has
given you such a face..

687
01:14:50,686 --> 01:14:54,327
..you will get work as
a joker in any circus.

688
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:03,533
Foolish major"

689
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,209
..you have already done a
mistake by coming here alone.

690
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:10,875
You committed the
second mistake..

691
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:12,279
..by saying that
Dong is a joker.

692
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:16,481
If you think that
you are a hero..

693
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:21,962
Then o you Indian Hero,
show me your magic.

694
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:25,153
Save these women from
this joker, here.

695
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:31,964
This Indian needs just his
hands to fight against jokers.

696
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:43,543
Shoot.. shoot.. Dong's
dogs.. shoot..

697
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:48,313
But remember.. if even
one bullet hits me..

698
01:15:48,477 --> 01:15:53,449
..your leader's neck
will be slashed too.

699
01:15:54,650 --> 01:16:01,465
If My neck is tortured,
you will be dead too.

700
01:16:01,623 --> 01:16:04,866
I have risked my death, Dong.

701
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:09,441
If you have the guts,
risk your death too.

702
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:14,513
Tell your dogs to shoot. Shoot!

703
01:16:23,278 --> 01:16:25,280
Children.. run!

704
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:31,622
Run!

705
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:40,063
Come on, joker. I will take
you to an Indian circus.

706
01:16:58,046 --> 01:17:02,517
Shetty.. why are you staring
at me? Go with the children.

707
01:17:02,684 --> 01:17:08,066
Sir, you? Don't worry about me.
I will cover you in another boat.

708
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:10,964
It is necessary for the
children to leave.

709
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:14,005
But papa--
- Dolly, go" 90--

710
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,609
Very good.. children.. go.. go..

711
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:21,878
Come on.. Dong.. come on..

712
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:28,212
Krishnrao, you will
pay for this!

713
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:49,908
I have not ruined the engine,
I ruined your life too.

714
01:17:51,733 --> 01:17:53,303
Gorilla couldn't risk
general Dong's life..

715
01:17:53,468 --> 01:17:56,972
..by stopping all the girls.
But stopping..

716
01:17:57,139 --> 01:18:01,110
..one girl, he has put
your life to risk.

717
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:15,126
Dong is never wrong.

718
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:16,360
Papa!

719
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:21,201
Dong.. if anything happens
to my daughter..

720
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:23,365
Nothing will happen
to your daughter.

721
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:26,206
Stop those girls.. stop them.

722
01:18:28,303 --> 01:18:32,445
Stop them..
- No.. - Stop them.. - No.

723
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:34,484
Or else.. your daughter.
- Papa..

724
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:41,560
You are dealing with
an Indian soldier.

725
01:18:42,617 --> 01:18:45,154
Not only a father.

726
01:18:47,322 --> 01:18:50,166
To save so many daughters..

727
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,404
I can sacrifice one daughter.

728
01:19:01,536 --> 01:19:04,244
Wow, Indian solider.. wow..

729
01:19:05,273 --> 01:19:08,846
You have really proved Dong
to be a joker today.

730
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:11,853
I will not kill your
daughter now.

731
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:15,528
I will take her to
Dongrila with me.

732
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:20,089
I will train her. I
will make her such..

733
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:22,861
..that she will dance
in the open market..

734
01:19:23,024 --> 01:19:26,562
..after one year, on the
occasion of Dongrila's annual day.

735
01:19:26,728 --> 01:19:27,934
No..

736
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:32,010
Dong is never wrong.

737
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:35,478
You are very proud of being
an India solider, isn't it?

738
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:39,050
Save your daughter if you can.

739
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:44,079
Not a day, a month I give
you time for a year.

740
01:19:45,247 --> 01:19:48,126
In between this time, if you
cannot take your daughter..

741
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:51,457
..come to Dongrila
on your knees..

742
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:55,397
I will make you a pimp
for your daughter.

743
01:19:55,557 --> 01:19:56,968
You rascal!

744
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:36,600
Major, can I join your mission?

745
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:52,954
Hello.

746
01:20:53,114 --> 01:20:54,684
Force five receiving,
come in, please.. over.

747
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:58,030
Hello, headquarters,
report.. over.

748
01:20:58,186 --> 01:21:00,962
Sir, we have reached
Dongrila's base.

749
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:04,069
But sir, it seems that our
mission has been leaked to Dong.

750
01:21:04,226 --> 01:21:05,899
Any encounter? Over.

751
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:07,904
Yes, sir. There was
a lot of gunfire.

752
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:09,406
But all of us are safe, over.

753
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:15,637
You can enter into Dongrila
only from Bongla pass.

754
01:21:16,071 --> 01:21:17,311
Only from Bongla pass.

755
01:21:17,472 --> 01:21:19,179
Over. Message received.

756
01:21:19,341 --> 01:21:22,083
God bless you, be alert. Over.

757
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:50,948
Three code four one one.
Miss Cynthia.

758
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:52,084
Yes, Mr. Kapoor.

759
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,948
They escaped from there,
even after..

760
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:57,954
..l gave such accurate
information.. How?

761
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:01,251
If this is Dongrila's
security, I think..

762
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:04,295
..that force five will be
successful.. And me..

763
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:07,392
You will be exposed
in your country.

764
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:10,399
Mr. Kapoor, isn't it?
- Yes.

765
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:15,132
Don't worry, Mr. Kapoor. I
have taken the charge now.

766
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:18,301
By the way, they will come
through Bongla pass.

767
01:22:18,466 --> 01:22:19,501
Keep that in mind.

768
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:22,979
Thank you, Mr. Kapoor. There
is some good news.

769
01:22:23,138 --> 01:22:25,914
The information price,
has been changed..

770
01:22:26,074 --> 01:22:28,315
..from five lakh dollars
to ten lakh dollars.

771
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:31,248
Thank you.

772
01:22:31,413 --> 01:22:36,089
Thank you. Give me regards
to General Dong.

773
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,431
God forbid.

774
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:51,101
What I have found out today,
what if someone else finds out?

775
01:22:51,266 --> 01:22:52,404
Tell me the prize.

776
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:59,416
You must have sold your
conscience in crores, sir.

777
01:22:59,574 --> 01:23:00,882
Tell me the cost.

778
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:04,282
Just a rupee.

779
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:07,559
A rupee?

780
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:12,187
A rupee for every Indian.
Therefore..

781
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:16,393
It is one eighty crores
for eighty crore Indians.

782
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:21,071
You must have taken this
amount from general Dong.

783
01:23:21,229 --> 01:23:25,507
Or did you sell your
compatriots for cheaper than this?

784
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:27,374
People like us are defamed.

785
01:23:27,535 --> 01:23:30,414
And faces, people like you.

786
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:33,917
Allahrakha.. - Hey, whom are
you scaring with your shouts?

787
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:38,922
The person in your presence, is
not your servant Allahrakha.

788
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:44,257
He is someone who has a
conscience, a Muslim.

789
01:23:44,419 --> 01:23:47,923
A patriotic Allahrakha!

790
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:52,333
My soldier.. you are
a very small soldier.

791
01:23:52,494 --> 01:23:56,636
You work for me. Nobody
will believe you.

792
01:23:57,098 --> 01:23:59,942
It is better for you, if
you make a deal with me.

793
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:01,537
Tell me how much do you want?

794
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:05,378
If a person sells his
conscience and earns..

795
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,019
"money, he isn't human.
If a Muslim..

796
01:24:07,175 --> 01:24:11,089
..is a betrayer to the country
he lives, he isn't a Muslim!

797
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:13,888
I swear to the martyrs
of Karbala.

798
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:16,928
Allahrakha will not tell anyone
that you are a betrayer.

799
01:24:17,085 --> 01:24:19,497
Or else, people will lose
their belief in the army.

800
01:24:21,022 --> 01:24:23,229
This Allahrakha,
this small man..

801
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:28,397
..this small man, your worker,
will kill you, today.

802
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:30,406
Allah! Allah!

803
01:24:49,684 --> 01:24:53,257
Nothing personal, my friend.
This is purely business.

804
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:56,527
Just business.

805
01:24:59,994 --> 01:25:01,871
Control room, this is general
Kapoor speaking.

806
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:07,169
My servant, Allahrakha,
was a traitor.

807
01:25:07,335 --> 01:25:12,546
He attacked me, his dead body is
in my office. Come and take it away.

808
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:19,481
Nothing personal. Business.

809
01:25:22,317 --> 01:25:25,890
Long live Dong!

810
01:25:26,054 --> 01:25:31,299
Long live Dong!

811
01:25:43,171 --> 01:25:46,448
The almighty can be wrong.

812
01:25:46,608 --> 01:25:51,648
But Dong is never wrong.

813
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:57,086
General Dong is your Almighty.

814
01:25:57,252 --> 01:26:02,258
His voice, is the
voice of your soul.

815
01:26:02,423 --> 01:26:06,394
Look at her, she moves twelve
hours in twenty four hours.

816
01:26:07,629 --> 01:26:11,008
And she.. she moves
sixteen hours.

817
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,435
And general..

818
01:26:14,702 --> 01:26:18,206
These girls have been punished
to move eighteen hours everyday.

819
01:26:18,373 --> 01:26:20,580
But these wretched
Indian girls..

820
01:26:20,742 --> 01:26:22,551
..they don't get ready at all.

821
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:02,019
Papa.

822
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:08,092
Papa“

823
01:27:08,256 --> 01:27:09,428
MY Papa.

824
01:27:09,591 --> 01:27:10,865
Your papa--

825
01:27:11,025 --> 01:27:12,095
MY Papa.

826
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:15,207
Papa, when will you
come to take me?

827
01:27:15,363 --> 01:27:17,900
Your papa has come.. yes..

828
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:21,946
That lame has climbed
all mountains.

829
01:27:22,103 --> 01:27:23,878
He has come to take you.

830
01:27:24,038 --> 01:27:26,075
I gave him time for a year.

831
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:28,278
But he has come in eleven
months and sixteen days.

832
01:27:28,443 --> 01:27:31,185
He has come..

833
01:27:31,346 --> 01:27:33,485
Then you start counting
your days.

834
01:27:33,648 --> 01:27:36,959
Or run away. Because
if my papa has come..

835
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:39,462
..then these two weeks will
be very difficult for you.

836
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:41,032
Very difficult.

837
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:47,972
Make her move the whole day!

838
01:27:50,665 --> 01:27:55,136
Major Krishnarao will find
these fourteen days very difficult.

839
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:29,876
Let them follow us.

840
01:28:30,038 --> 01:28:33,451
There they are. Go and catch them.

841
01:30:11,038 --> 01:30:12,381
Don't worry about me..
shoot them!

842
01:30:29,657 --> 01:30:30,931
Damn it!

843
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:35,601
Give me your hand, major.

844
01:30:56,384 --> 01:31:02,130
He is going alla lone. If I get
him, I will get his friends too.

845
01:31:24,212 --> 01:31:27,921
I swear to God.. I will
fly from this today.

846
01:31:45,066 --> 01:31:46,136
Look at this now.

847
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:00,559
You idiot bastard,
leave me alone.

848
01:32:00,715 --> 01:32:06,631
You English chicken. When you
have called Indian bastards..

849
01:32:07,121 --> 01:32:12,298
I swear.. see what kind
of bastards we are.

850
01:32:19,033 --> 01:32:20,307
This is just the beginning.

851
01:32:21,469 --> 01:32:24,973
We will take you below the
umbrella some other day.

852
01:32:41,689 --> 01:32:50,336
Finito.. finish.. come on..
come on.. follow me.

853
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:53,145
He is Prince Karl.

854
01:32:53,301 --> 01:32:54,609
He is the brother
of the dead king.

855
01:32:54,769 --> 01:32:55,941
Dong has left him
thinking that he..

856
01:32:56,103 --> 01:32:59,050
..is a drunkard and
a good for nothing.

857
01:32:59,206 --> 01:33:00,879
But in reality, he
is the president..

858
01:33:01,042 --> 01:33:03,181
..of a underground
revolutionary party.

859
01:33:03,477 --> 01:33:07,015
And he wishes to free Dongrila
from Dong's tyranny.

860
01:33:08,149 --> 01:33:11,096
Therefore, he will
help us secretly.

861
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:13,892
But you didn't speak
about prince Karl..

862
01:33:14,055 --> 01:33:16,057
..in the plan that you gave
at the headquarters.

863
01:33:16,223 --> 01:33:18,464
Just like how I hadn't
mentioned major Dharamsingh too.

864
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:21,037
I want to play safe.

865
01:33:21,195 --> 01:33:24,039
Even then, Dong knows
all our steps.

866
01:33:24,198 --> 01:33:26,576
Because one of his agent
is in your security.

867
01:33:27,034 --> 01:33:28,240
But that's impossible.

868
01:33:28,402 --> 01:33:31,406
It is possible. And therefore..

869
01:33:31,572 --> 01:33:33,518
We will have to get the
secret file first.

870
01:33:33,674 --> 01:33:38,453
It has the names of all the
agents of King Dong all over India.

871
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:41,389
Mrs. D'Costa will help
you in this matter.

872
01:33:41,549 --> 01:33:43,153
Hi.
- Hi.

873
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:45,923
She is the general secretary
of our party.

874
01:33:46,087 --> 01:33:50,058
She will take you to some safe
place here, away from here.

875
01:33:50,224 --> 01:33:52,500
We haven't come here to
go to some safe place.

876
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:53,934
Dong is staying in
the cantonment..

877
01:33:54,095 --> 01:33:57,338
..residency outside the
city at this time.

878
01:33:57,531 --> 01:33:58,942
And the only mode of
transport there..

879
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:00,943
..is a trolley, we can only
go through a trolley.

880
01:34:01,302 --> 01:34:05,375
But even a bird can go there
without Dong's permission.

881
01:34:05,539 --> 01:34:06,882
Therefore, I suggest..

882
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:10,045
You stay out of the city
for your further plans.

883
01:34:10,211 --> 01:34:14,626
The military has prepared traps
for you inside the city.

884
01:34:16,417 --> 01:34:18,226
Mr. Karl, your stop has arrived.

885
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:20,956
Okay, friends, all
the best to you.

886
01:34:21,122 --> 01:34:22,965
Please go with Mrs.
D'Costa after this.

887
01:34:23,124 --> 01:34:26,128
<i>Finite" ﬁnite" ﬁnish"</i>

888
01:34:34,068 --> 01:34:35,513
This farm belongs to an
officer of Dong, Jello.

889
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:39,584
Don't worry. He lives
in the cantonment.

890
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:42,118
He comes here only for eight
days in a year, for holidays.

891
01:34:42,276 --> 01:34:45,553
None will suspect a military
officer's house.

892
01:34:45,713 --> 01:34:47,920
But someone must be living
in this farmhouse.

893
01:34:48,082 --> 01:34:50,426
Some servant, or some gardener.

894
01:34:50,584 --> 01:34:52,962
Some Juley lives near the river.

895
01:34:56,624 --> 01:34:58,535
This Juley.. is it some
woman's name? - Yes.

896
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:00,104
She is a important member
of our party.

897
01:35:00,261 --> 01:35:04,266
Dong's officer and a
revolutionary, very strange.

898
01:35:04,432 --> 01:35:06,469
Her brother doesn't
know about this.

899
01:35:06,634 --> 01:35:08,375
We profit a lot with this.

900
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:11,881
We come to know about
Dong's actions before.

901
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:13,313
Why don't you go and change?

902
01:35:13,474 --> 01:35:14,612
I will bring Juley.

903
01:35:15,009 --> 01:35:16,317
Shall I come along,
to call Juley?

904
01:35:16,477 --> 01:35:18,479
No, please go inside.
I will call her.

905
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:21,055
Juley..

906
01:35:21,215 --> 01:35:22,888
Juley.. Juley..

907
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:24,829
It seems that she must be
parading the new children.

908
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,222
I will teach you the salute now.

909
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:30,096
When you will be
told to salute..

910
01:35:30,257 --> 01:35:32,498
..then you will raise your
hand like this and salute.

911
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:33,638
Okay?

912
01:35:33,794 --> 01:35:35,432
So.. salute!

913
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:39,901
The real soldiers can
give their life..

914
01:35:40,067 --> 01:35:44,482
..for their commander's
orders too.

915
01:35:45,706 --> 01:35:46,946
Salute!

916
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:50,980
Juley.. Juley..

917
01:35:52,346 --> 01:35:53,916
Mrs. D'Costa!

918
01:36:29,183 --> 01:36:30,218
Juley..

919
01:36:30,384 --> 01:36:32,489
Mrs. D'Costa.. you
have arrived..

920
01:36:32,653 --> 01:36:34,223
I thought that you
wouldn't come.

921
01:36:34,388 --> 01:36:37,528
Shall I tell you? I heard that
there will be a storm today.

922
01:36:37,691 --> 01:36:40,365
The storm didn't come,
and you arrived.

923
01:36:40,528 --> 01:36:42,269
Yes.. your guests..

924
01:36:42,429 --> 01:36:43,908
They have arrived.

925
01:36:44,064 --> 01:36:45,407
They have?

926
01:37:09,123 --> 01:37:11,034
Juley. Thanks.

927
01:37:11,559 --> 01:37:12,867
Juley.
- Thanks.

928
01:37:14,962 --> 01:37:16,032
Juley.
- Thanks.

929
01:37:16,197 --> 01:37:17,175
Juley.
- Thank you.

930
01:37:18,032 --> 01:37:20,308
Juley.
- Thank you, pretty girl.

931
01:37:20,467 --> 01:37:22,572
Juley.
- Javed.

932
01:37:24,572 --> 01:37:25,880
Oh..

933
01:37:30,044 --> 01:37:32,285
Will you feel bad if I give
you the flower in my hair?

934
01:37:32,446 --> 01:37:35,893
You will give me something
and I won't like it?

935
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:37,552
Am I such a fool?

936
01:37:38,652 --> 01:37:39,892
Juley.
- Thank you.

937
01:37:40,054 --> 01:37:42,466
That's a wonderful name.

938
01:37:42,623 --> 01:37:47,231
Welcome.
- Then this for me.

939
01:37:47,394 --> 01:37:49,237
There is some different meaning
for that. That is bye, bye.

940
01:37:49,396 --> 01:37:50,898
Then this will be for him.

941
01:37:51,065 --> 01:37:53,636
We will make for
you. - I will accompany you..

942
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:58,641
Sir.. it is important to keep
an eye.. - Okay. - Yes, sir.

943
01:37:59,073 --> 01:38:02,418
Okay, boys. Let us get
the positions please.

944
01:38:03,677 --> 01:38:06,283
Captain Rakesh.Go behind.

945
01:38:06,614 --> 01:38:09,458
Captain Javed, look at
the gates. - Yes, sir.

946
01:38:09,617 --> 01:38:12,097
Captain Anju, you check
the signals. - Yes, sir.

947
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:15,526
Major Dharamsingh..
- I will check the ammunition.

948
01:38:21,996 --> 01:38:23,998
Damn it.

949
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:38,079
What? Does that mean
you did not like me?

950
01:38:39,079 --> 01:38:43,118
No. I liked all, especially
the one with blonde eyes.

951
01:38:43,284 --> 01:38:45,423
No, no, he is a number
one playboy.

952
01:38:45,586 --> 01:38:48,590
Then the one with the
gangster type body?

953
01:38:49,089 --> 01:38:50,591
He does not know anything
except walking like models.

954
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:53,264
The other two then. First
the one with a beard.

955
01:38:53,427 --> 01:38:54,405
He is very boring.

956
01:38:54,561 --> 01:38:57,201
Okay, that muscle man.
- He looks like your uncle.

957
01:38:57,364 --> 01:38:58,934
But I liked all.

958
01:38:59,099 --> 01:39:02,012
Okay, so you liked
all but not me.

959
01:39:02,169 --> 01:39:04,547
All others are heroes
and am I a villain?

960
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:07,542
Do I not look like
a hero? Do I not?

961
01:39:08,042 --> 01:39:14,550
You look. You do look like
a hero, but of art films.

962
01:39:15,049 --> 01:39:20,556
What? Do I look like an
art film hero to you?

963
01:39:21,055 --> 01:39:22,898
Does my face resemble
Salim the lame one?

964
01:39:23,057 --> 01:39:25,367
Do I have a flowing beard? Do
I have a bag on my shoulder?

965
01:39:25,526 --> 01:39:27,096
Do I wear kurtas?
Do I smoke beedis?

966
01:39:27,261 --> 01:39:30,037
Do I wear broken slippers? Art
film! I'll make you laugh..

967
01:39:30,197 --> 01:39:32,575
..in the style of commercial
film heroes. - Captain Ranveer!

968
01:39:37,071 --> 01:39:38,049
How did you voice
become so heavy?

969
01:39:38,205 --> 01:39:42,051
Did you forget that my
voice is heavy since..

970
01:39:42,209 --> 01:39:43,313
..the time of Mahabharat?
- Sir.

971
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:46,321
Tell me one thing. You have
come here to Dongri-La..

972
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:49,461
..to become a hero or
a comedian? - Comedian.

973
01:39:49,616 --> 01:39:53,063
Your friend is a better
comedian than you.

974
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:54,198
He made me laugh instantly.
- Friend? Who?

975
01:39:54,355 --> 01:39:55,390
Ranveer?

976
01:39:55,556 --> 01:39:56,796
Oh my God, what has happened?

977
01:39:59,593 --> 01:40:01,436
Do not ask. He has
got a seizure.

978
01:40:01,595 --> 01:40:03,597
You take care of him. I shall
bring the doctor rightaway.

979
01:40:06,433 --> 01:40:09,414
God please, save him.
Please God.

980
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:11,015
Juley, just tell that you love
me and I look like a hero.

981
01:40:14,308 --> 01:40:15,286
You look like a hero.

982
01:40:26,387 --> 01:40:30,233
Juley, where are my children?

983
01:40:30,391 --> 01:40:31,369
Oh my God!

984
01:40:46,573 --> 01:40:47,551
Oh God!

985
01:40:51,412 --> 01:40:56,657
Keep your hands down. Why did
you not lower your hands?

986
01:40:57,151 --> 01:41:00,064
You only had told till the
commander does not instruct..

987
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:04,100
..the soldier must not
keep his hands down.

988
01:41:04,258 --> 01:41:05,259
Good, good, good.

989
01:41:05,426 --> 01:41:06,404
Children!

990
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,597
Mother, mother!

991
01:41:10,097 --> 01:41:11,599
Okay, then salute them.

992
01:41:14,435 --> 01:41:15,413
Enough, you'll get tired.

993
01:41:15,569 --> 01:41:17,606
Mother, has he come to sister
to become a soldier?

994
01:41:18,105 --> 01:41:21,348
No, he's already a big
soldier of India.

995
01:41:21,508 --> 01:41:25,012
Sister has told us many
stories of India.

996
01:41:25,179 --> 01:41:29,150
We'll become brave when we grow
up like these soldiers..

997
01:41:29,316 --> 01:41:33,492
..and free our nation from Dong.

998
01:41:33,654 --> 01:41:37,431
Good, my little soldiers!
But if Dong remains alive..

999
01:41:37,591 --> 01:41:42,631
..till you grow up, then your
nation wouldn't survive.

1000
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:46,236
I promise that I will free
your nation from Dong.

1001
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,471
Rocky, Javed, Captain Ranveer,
come quickly.

1002
01:41:50,471 --> 01:41:51,449
What happened?

1003
01:41:51,605 --> 01:41:53,380
Sir, Major Kishan Nath's
doctor has said..

1004
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:54,985
..that gangrene is spreading
in his foot.

1005
01:41:55,142 --> 01:41:57,122
The poison is quickly spreading
all over his body.

1006
01:41:57,277 --> 01:41:58,255
It is necessary to operate
upon him quickly.

1007
01:41:59,413 --> 01:42:03,190
Gangrene! The terrorists
of lndia..

1008
01:42:03,350 --> 01:42:08,129
..shall be very soon presented
before you journalists.

1009
01:42:19,433 --> 01:42:20,411
Stop!

1010
01:42:24,438 --> 01:42:26,076
Hey Major, what happened?
- Checking, checking.

1011
01:42:53,534 --> 01:42:56,515
Hello, Colonel Richard, what
is happening? Checking?

1012
01:42:56,670 --> 01:42:59,378
Mrs. D'Costa, who is that man?

1013
01:42:59,540 --> 01:43:01,042
He is my new man.

1014
01:43:01,208 --> 01:43:02,186
He is my new man.

1015
01:43:02,342 --> 01:43:06,916
When did you marry? Why
did you not invite me?

1016
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:08,457
I meant he is my servant.

1017
01:43:08,615 --> 01:43:10,595
Oh, I am sorry. Servant.

1018
01:43:11,084 --> 01:43:13,064
Sir, I am madam's new servant.

1019
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:15,063
Okay, okay, what is
in this tanker?

1020
01:43:15,222 --> 01:43:17,065
Colonel Richard, I forgot
to tell you..

1021
01:43:17,224 --> 01:43:19,932
..l have begun the business of
supplying water to the city.

1022
01:43:20,093 --> 01:43:23,597
Water to the city? There is no
water shortage in the city.

1023
01:43:24,097 --> 01:43:27,078
Sir, this is not ordinary
water. This is special rose water..

1024
01:43:27,234 --> 01:43:30,340
..from the rose lake. People
have stomach problems..

1025
01:43:30,504 --> 01:43:33,348
..we have brought this water
to cleanse those stomachs.

1026
01:43:33,507 --> 01:43:35,077
This is water of the
rose lake. Yes, sir.

1027
01:43:35,242 --> 01:43:36,220
Rose lake?

1028
01:43:36,376 --> 01:43:38,947
For your Dog sir.

1029
01:43:39,112 --> 01:43:40,090
Dog?
. Dug.

1030
01:43:40,247 --> 01:43:42,090
Dog?
. Dug.

1031
01:43:42,249 --> 01:43:45,628
Dog? - Dog. Not that barking
dog. Your Dog.

1032
01:43:46,119 --> 01:43:48,963
That means you provide
water to General Dong.

1033
01:43:49,122 --> 01:43:52,103
Okay, okay, I'll
check it myself.

1034
01:43:54,528 --> 01:43:55,506
Open, open.

1035
01:43:55,662 --> 01:43:57,300
Open, open.

1036
01:43:58,599 --> 01:44:02,240
Hey sir, check it leisurely.
Remove less water from it.

1037
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:19,595
Good, good, nice water. Okay
Miss D'Costa, you can go now.

1038
01:44:20,354 --> 01:44:21,594
Let them go.

1039
01:44:22,422 --> 01:44:23,400
Wait!

1040
01:44:27,527 --> 01:44:28,505
Hold it!

1041
01:44:39,106 --> 01:44:40,084
Lift this.

1042
01:44:42,109 --> 01:44:43,611
Hey.you,you-.

1043
01:44:44,111 --> 01:44:47,957
lt stung me, it stung me.
A bumblebee, it stung me.

1044
01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:49,093
Where is it?

1045
01:44:49,249 --> 01:44:51,092
This is the cure, sir. When
a bumblebee stings,

1046
01:44:51,251 --> 01:44:52,229
this is the cure.

1047
01:44:52,386 --> 01:44:53,364
Cure? Cure?

1048
01:45:00,494 --> 01:45:02,474
Did a bumblebee bite you?
- Yes, many times.

1049
01:45:02,629 --> 01:45:04,575
Did you get it treated?
- No, no.

1050
01:45:05,065 --> 01:45:10,037
So, I'll treat it. I'll treat
you. The marks will go..

1051
01:45:10,203 --> 01:45:11,910
..the swellings will go.

1052
01:45:12,072 --> 01:45:14,052
Okay, beat me, beat me.

1053
01:45:14,207 --> 01:45:17,051
I have to go. You do one thing,
keep the boot..

1054
01:45:17,210 --> 01:45:20,919
..and continue hitting
yourself. Okay, bye, sir.

1055
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:22,126
Wait.

1056
01:45:24,284 --> 01:45:26,264
I also want a bottle of
water of the rose lake.

1057
01:45:30,424 --> 01:45:33,132
Sir, we are taking this
water for Mr. Dong.

1058
01:45:33,293 --> 01:45:35,933
Why are you troubling us?
How can we give you water?

1059
01:45:36,096 --> 01:45:37,074
One bottle.

1060
01:45:37,230 --> 01:45:39,210
One glass. Okay, one
glass. Take it.

1061
01:45:39,366 --> 01:45:43,405
Take it, but it will
be a little warm.

1062
01:45:43,570 --> 01:45:47,017
Open the lower tap and take it.

1063
01:45:49,109 --> 01:45:50,486
You see there. You
do not look here.

1064
01:46:00,387 --> 01:46:01,365
Rose lake!

1065
01:46:13,066 --> 01:46:19,574
Very tasty, very tasty.
Yes, have some more.

1066
01:46:20,273 --> 01:46:21,251
It's good for you.

1067
01:46:28,081 --> 01:46:31,585
Sir, did you find it nice? This
was absolutely pure water.

1068
01:46:32,085 --> 01:46:35,066
That's why you liked it. Next
time I'll give you better water.

1069
01:46:35,222 --> 01:46:36,200
You try some more, sir.

1070
01:46:36,356 --> 01:46:37,926
Can I go, sir?
- Go, go.

1071
01:46:38,091 --> 01:46:39,069
Goodbye sir.

1072
01:46:40,627 --> 01:46:41,605
Let them go.

1073
01:46:54,574 --> 01:46:56,076
There is very strict
checking here.

1074
01:46:56,243 --> 01:47:00,020
But we'll have to face this.
Because this is the only route..

1075
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:01,158
..to reach the city
till evening.

1076
01:47:01,314 --> 01:47:03,885
ls there no hospital
outside the city?

1077
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:06,553
Only the hospital in the city
has operation facilities.

1078
01:47:07,053 --> 01:47:09,033
You understand. Today
the authorities have..

1079
01:47:09,189 --> 01:47:11,032
..cordoned off all routes
leading to the city.

1080
01:47:11,191 --> 01:47:12,568
You will have to go
there on foot only.

1081
01:47:13,059 --> 01:47:15,039
On foot? Till today, we
have not even gone..

1082
01:47:15,195 --> 01:47:17,038
..to the loo on foot.
Why Mr. Hardy?

1083
01:47:17,197 --> 01:47:18,232
Yes Mr. Laurel. And
never together.

1084
01:47:20,066 --> 01:47:22,046
Did you hear that? And you
want that we should..

1085
01:47:22,202 --> 01:47:24,580
..walk so far to the
city from here?

1086
01:47:25,071 --> 01:47:26,049
Instead of performing
in the hotel..

1087
01:47:26,206 --> 01:47:28,186
..we must perform
in the hospital..

1088
01:47:28,341 --> 01:47:30,912
..which I think is near your
hotel? - Near the hospital?

1089
01:47:31,077 --> 01:47:35,423
But sir, we have called the
head office for permission.

1090
01:47:35,582 --> 01:47:40,053
Perhaps, your vehicle will get
permission to enter the city.

1091
01:48:09,316 --> 01:48:10,294
Save us, save us!

1092
01:48:10,450 --> 01:48:12,555
Who are you?
- Laurel and Hardy.

1093
01:48:13,053 --> 01:48:14,293
<i>And you?
- Lambu and Chum.</i>

1094
01:48:14,454 --> 01:48:15,432
But they are having
a show today?

1095
01:48:15,589 --> 01:48:16,567
A show?

1096
01:48:46,086 --> 01:48:48,066
It's party time,
it's party time,

1097
01:48:48,221 --> 01:48:50,064
it's party, party, party time.

1098
01:48:50,223 --> 01:48:52,066
It's party time, it's party
time, it's party,.

1099
01:48:52,225 --> 01:48:53,203
Party. party time

1100
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:55,601
I am Laurel, you're Hardy;
let's begin the party.

1101
01:48:56,096 --> 01:48:59,475
I'm Lambu, you're Chutki;
give me a playful pinch.

1102
01:49:52,085 --> 01:49:55,396
Your heart is my heart..

1103
01:49:55,555 --> 01:49:57,592
My heart is yours.

1104
01:50:00,093 --> 01:50:04,405
See, do not change; do
not go afar from me.

1105
01:50:05,098 --> 01:50:07,135
Your heart is my heart..

1106
01:50:08,301 --> 01:50:09,279
My heart is yours.

1107
01:50:54,147 --> 01:50:57,128
How lovely you are! Tell
me you are mine.

1108
01:50:57,283 --> 01:50:59,661
You are in my dreams.

1109
01:51:00,086 --> 01:51:05,058
You are in thoughts,
all days and nights..

1110
01:51:05,225 --> 01:51:07,330
You are a part of my life.

1111
01:51:12,098 --> 01:51:15,079
How lovely you are! Tell
me you are mine.

1112
01:51:15,235 --> 01:51:18,216
You are in my dreams.

1113
01:51:18,371 --> 01:51:22,478
You are in thoughts,
all days and nights..

1114
01:51:22,642 --> 01:51:25,418
You are a part of my life.

1115
01:51:25,578 --> 01:51:27,615
Your sorrow is mine..

1116
01:51:30,116 --> 01:51:31,618
My sorrow is yours..

1117
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:36,623
See, do not change; do
not go afar from me.

1118
01:51:40,126 --> 01:51:42,436
Your heart is my heart..

1119
01:51:44,130 --> 01:51:46,132
My heart is yours.

1120
01:51:52,405 --> 01:51:55,477
Hey, you wanna have
some fun? Look at me.

1121
01:51:55,642 --> 01:51:57,485
Leave that girl alone.

1122
01:52:50,130 --> 01:52:55,102
Let me come ahead, let
my love be felt..

1123
01:52:55,268 --> 01:52:57,578
I shall wipe away
these tears..

1124
01:52:58,138 --> 01:53:03,053
We have come in this world
with a gift of love..

1125
01:53:03,209 --> 01:53:04,381
We shall remove these fears.

1126
01:53:05,078 --> 01:53:06,921
Your pain is mine..

1127
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:10,584
My pain is yours.

1128
01:53:13,086 --> 01:53:15,430
See, do not change; do
not go afar from me.

1129
01:53:19,092 --> 01:53:21,436
Your heart is my heart..

1130
01:53:23,096 --> 01:53:24,074
My heart is yours.

1131
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:48,098
Stop.

1132
01:53:59,465 --> 01:54:01,103
Did you see General
Dong's arrangement?

1133
01:54:01,267 --> 01:54:04,043
He emptied the whole hospital.
We knew that poison has..

1134
01:54:04,204 --> 01:54:07,048
..spread in Major Rao's
body and that you would..

1135
01:54:07,207 --> 01:54:10,586
..surely bring him here
for an operation.

1136
01:54:11,077 --> 01:54:13,182
Go, bring their
other companions.

1137
01:54:13,346 --> 01:54:18,921
Wait! There is no need to call.
Our men are here itself.

1138
01:54:30,630 --> 01:54:31,608
You stooge of Dong!

1139
01:54:40,373 --> 01:54:41,613
Javed, oxygen.

1140
01:55:18,544 --> 01:55:20,251
You people are surrounded
from all sides.

1141
01:55:22,081 --> 01:55:24,925
Surrender to my men and
come out of the hospital.

1142
01:55:25,084 --> 01:55:27,587
I give you time till
I count up to 5.

1143
01:55:30,423 --> 01:55:31,424
One..

1144
01:55:35,094 --> 01:55:36,402
Two--.

1145
01:55:38,364 --> 01:55:39,342
Three..

1146
01:55:43,636 --> 01:55:44,614
Four..

1147
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:48,618
Five..

1148
01:55:50,109 --> 01:55:51,952
Six..

1149
01:55:52,111 --> 01:55:53,089
Seven..

1150
01:55:53,246 --> 01:55:54,224
Eight..

1151
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:55,358
Nine..

1152
01:55:55,515 --> 01:55:56,550
Ten..

1153
01:55:58,184 --> 01:55:59,162
Hundred..

1154
01:55:59,319 --> 01:56:00,229
Thousand..

1155
01:56:02,055 --> 01:56:04,365
Keep counting, baby,
as far as you know.

1156
01:56:04,524 --> 01:56:07,903
Purring of cats does
not tame lions.

1157
01:56:08,061 --> 01:56:12,032
Go and tell your Dong that
to make him wrong..

1158
01:56:12,198 --> 01:56:16,442
..along with Major Kishan Rao,
Dharam Singh has also come.

1159
01:58:08,047 --> 01:58:10,027
Javed, I'll try to bring the
Major into consciousness..

1160
01:58:10,183 --> 01:58:11,161
..so that blood clotting
does not take place.

1161
01:58:11,317 --> 01:58:13,354
But as soon as possible, you
should arrange for lights.

1162
01:58:22,128 --> 01:58:23,903
Now there is only one way
to arrange for lights.

1163
01:58:24,063 --> 01:58:25,064
That generator!

1164
01:58:28,067 --> 01:58:30,047
But for that we shall have to
finish all these soldiers..

1165
01:58:30,203 --> 01:58:31,238
..and control this entire area.

1166
01:58:31,404 --> 01:58:33,577
And that is impossible.
Sheer madness!

1167
01:58:34,073 --> 01:58:35,245
Sir, please.
- Major!

1168
01:58:37,410 --> 01:58:39,390
Get aside. Take
the Major inside.

1169
01:58:43,082 --> 01:58:44,060
I am not important, the
mission is important.

1170
01:58:44,217 --> 01:58:47,926
And to save me, you have put
the mission into danger.

1171
01:58:48,087 --> 01:58:50,067
You do not worry about
the mission.

1172
01:58:50,223 --> 01:58:51,201
Such dangers are commonplace
to me.

1173
01:58:51,357 --> 01:58:53,268
If you have called me,
have faith in me.

1174
01:58:53,426 --> 01:58:55,599
I'll gun all these
dogs down to death.

1175
01:59:00,032 --> 01:59:02,205
I agree, Dharam Singh, that
you will finish all of them.

1176
01:59:02,368 --> 01:59:06,077
But do not forget that
Dong does not have..

1177
01:59:06,239 --> 01:59:09,220
..only these many men.
He has many more men.

1178
01:59:10,376 --> 01:59:12,151
If you kill me, more will come.

1179
01:59:12,311 --> 01:59:15,952
Your bullets will be exhausted,
but these soldiers won't stop.

1180
01:59:20,052 --> 01:59:21,224
This is not a war,
but a suicide.

1181
01:59:23,489 --> 01:59:24,467
What have you done to save me?

1182
01:59:27,059 --> 01:59:28,037
Sir, there is a valley here.

1183
01:59:30,196 --> 01:59:34,042
Major, this valley is safe.
You all go here and..

1184
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:38,410
..save yourselves.
- What? Major, you are so weak!

1185
01:59:40,072 --> 01:59:41,050
More than a soldier's
reputation..

1186
01:59:41,207 --> 01:59:42,185
..you have begun to
value your life?

1187
01:59:42,341 --> 01:59:45,413
Let our lives go today,
but not our reputations.

1188
01:59:47,079 --> 01:59:51,050
I'll put down so many corpses
of these dogs here today..

1189
01:59:51,217 --> 01:59:55,063
..that there will no earth
left to burn their pyres.

1190
01:59:55,221 --> 01:59:56,928
Dong will remain alive, though.
His crime will be alive.

1191
01:59:59,091 --> 02:00:04,063
But brothers, if we die
and Dong remains alive..

1192
02:00:04,230 --> 02:00:09,077
..then along with us will die
the pride of those Indians who..

1193
02:00:09,235 --> 02:00:14,082
..know that their soldiers do
not protect just their borders..

1194
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:18,017
..but who can show to
the whole world that..

1195
02:00:18,177 --> 02:00:22,023
..whenever a bastard like
Dong can wreak havoc..

1196
02:00:22,181 --> 02:00:26,152
..in the world with his
sword of terrorism..

1197
02:00:26,319 --> 02:00:30,165
..then Indians can also
go into his country and..

1198
02:00:30,323 --> 02:00:31,301
..answer his havoc with ours.

1199
02:00:37,463 --> 02:00:40,171
Okay, commander. You take
these people and..

1200
02:00:40,333 --> 02:00:43,644
..enter into the valley. Till
then, I'll stop these people here.

1201
02:00:44,136 --> 02:00:48,642
You call me commander and teach
me the wrong way also.

1202
02:00:50,276 --> 02:00:53,120
Have you forgotten that
a commander first..

1203
02:00:53,279 --> 02:00:56,123
..extracts his people
from danger?

1204
02:00:56,282 --> 02:00:57,260
After that he extracts himself.

1205
02:00:57,416 --> 02:00:59,396
How can we leave you
in this condition?

1206
02:00:59,552 --> 02:01:02,465
I agree that my destiny
has failed me, friend..

1207
02:01:02,622 --> 02:01:05,603
..but I am not such
a big criminal that..

1208
02:01:06,092 --> 02:01:11,599
..l should not get the privilege
to dying a soldier's death.

1209
02:01:15,434 --> 02:01:19,348
From today, I appoint you the
commander of my small army.

1210
02:01:22,174 --> 02:01:26,953
My friend, my mission
is yours from today.

1211
02:01:28,247 --> 02:01:32,627
Dong has challenged me; you
have to fulfil that now.

1212
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:38,462
In front of Dong, this
father may be shamed..

1213
02:01:38,624 --> 02:01:41,628
..but not this soldier.

1214
02:01:43,129 --> 02:01:46,110
Major Kishan Rao, neither
will a soldier be shamed..

1215
02:01:46,265 --> 02:01:52,375
..nor will a father. Along with
it, we shall not forget..

1216
02:01:52,538 --> 02:01:55,178
..to take your daughter Dolly
with us. This is a promise.

1217
02:02:16,095 --> 02:02:20,601
O Mother India, I have come to
put my head in your feet..

1218
02:02:25,104 --> 02:02:29,280
Whatever breath I have left,
I have come to give it to you.

1219
02:02:33,112 --> 02:02:37,618
O Mother India, I have come to
put my head in your feet..

1220
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:45,967
Whatever breath I have left,
I have come to give it to you.

1221
02:02:49,128 --> 02:02:55,636
With our lives in our hands,
we have come to show..

1222
02:02:56,135 --> 02:03:02,051
..the whole nation shall see,
I have come here to die.

1223
02:03:05,077 --> 02:03:10,925
I have come to die
for my friends.

1224
02:03:11,083 --> 02:03:17,056
My heart is touched by
those who care for me.

1225
02:03:17,223 --> 02:03:23,071
My heart is touched by
those who care for me.

1226
02:03:35,107 --> 02:03:36,950
The surrounding buildings
will collapse, sir.

1227
02:03:37,109 --> 02:03:38,087
Many innocent people will die.

1228
02:03:38,244 --> 02:03:40,554
I say, blast the hospital.

1229
02:03:45,651 --> 02:03:46,629
Blast the hospital.

1230
02:04:35,100 --> 02:04:37,273
Headquarters here,
Code 5 come in.

1231
02:04:37,436 --> 02:04:41,145
No Rakesh, the enemy
is coming to know..

1232
02:04:41,307 --> 02:04:45,084
..of all our movements. It may
be that all information..

1233
02:04:45,244 --> 02:04:49,090
..through this transmitter
may be intercepted..

1234
02:04:49,248 --> 02:04:51,091
"By the enemy's transmitter-
It can also be that--.

1235
02:04:51,250 --> 02:04:53,287
..there is some traitor sitting
in General Kapoor's office.

1236
02:04:53,452 --> 02:04:55,159
That means we should
not send any news..

1237
02:04:55,321 --> 02:04:56,356
..to the headquarters?

1238
02:04:57,456 --> 02:05:01,233
No, we'll send the news.
The final news.

1239
02:05:05,397 --> 02:05:11,575
Hello, Mr. Kapoor, this is me.
Did you recognise my voice?

1240
02:05:13,072 --> 02:05:20,854
I am Dharam Singh, who was
court-martialled due to you.

1241
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:24,254
I'll tell you later why I am
here. Now there is a message..

1242
02:05:24,416 --> 02:05:30,389
..not for you, but for that cur
of Dong who is relaying all..

1243
02:05:30,556 --> 02:05:34,333
..our messages to Dong.
If he is listening now..

1244
02:05:34,493 --> 02:05:39,203
..then let him listen
with cocked ears that..

1245
02:05:39,365 --> 02:05:44,610
..Dongri-La's annual day will
be the last day of Dong's life.

1246
02:05:45,104 --> 02:05:48,608
This is not a prediction, but
Dharam Singh's challenge.

1247
02:06:43,095 --> 02:06:47,271
Dong is never wrong.

1248
02:06:56,108 --> 02:07:00,352
Come, come, Cynthia. I
was waiting for you.

1249
02:07:00,512 --> 02:07:03,391
See what all I have ordered
for your dinner.

1250
02:07:03,549 --> 02:07:09,556
See these fruits. See these
breads and these sweets.

1251
02:07:10,055 --> 02:07:12,035
These are very important.
Come here.

1252
02:07:15,060 --> 02:07:21,033
Call the Brahmins. Today is
your mourning dinner, isn't it?

1253
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:22,577
General!

1254
02:07:38,417 --> 02:07:41,125
Madam Cynthia, you were
unsuccessful in killing..

1255
02:07:41,286 --> 02:07:44,062
..all other Indians except
Major Kishan Rao.

1256
02:07:44,223 --> 02:07:46,601
For that General Dyer
sentences you to death.

1257
02:07:48,227 --> 02:07:51,071
In the annual day to be
celebrated four days from now..

1258
02:07:51,230 --> 02:07:52,208
..you shall commit suicide.

1259
02:07:54,166 --> 02:07:59,616
For that, my beautiful
intelligent chief Miss Cynthia..

1260
02:08:00,039 --> 02:08:03,885
..within these four days
if you find and tell us..

1261
02:08:04,043 --> 02:08:07,024
..where these Indians are
hidden, then the annual day..

1262
02:08:07,179 --> 02:08:13,562
..will not be day for
you to commit suicide..

1263
02:08:14,053 --> 02:08:17,557
..but it will be the most
happy day for you.

1264
02:08:18,057 --> 02:08:19,559
Make haste, Miss Cynthia.

1265
02:08:23,062 --> 02:08:28,239
Today we need you for in
the fight against Dong.

1266
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:31,108
This fight is not just
yours, but also of

1267
02:08:31,270 --> 02:08:32,248
the people of Dongri-La.

1268
02:08:32,404 --> 02:08:35,408
We can even give up our lives
for it. You give the orders.

1269
02:08:35,574 --> 02:08:38,418
Great! Look, anyhow you have
to enter the cantonment..

1270
02:08:38,577 --> 02:08:42,320
..tomorrow and there is
only one route for that.

1271
02:08:43,082 --> 02:08:45,062
Your brother Jaylu.

1272
02:08:45,217 --> 02:08:46,252
Jaylu?

1273
02:08:46,418 --> 02:08:50,127
Yes, Juley. Your brother lives
in the soldier barracks..

1274
02:08:50,289 --> 02:08:54,066
..in the cantonment area.
Behind those barracks..

1275
02:08:54,226 --> 02:08:58,003
..there is a valley that
has no guard over it.

1276
02:08:58,163 --> 02:09:01,940
If we manage to put
a in the barracks..

1277
02:09:02,101 --> 02:09:03,079
..then we can enter the
barracks from the other side..

1278
02:09:03,235 --> 02:09:05,215
..of the valley through
a rope trolley.

1279
02:09:05,370 --> 02:09:06,348
All right.

1280
02:09:06,505 --> 02:09:08,348
You cannot do this work alone.
The barrack wall is..

1281
02:09:08,507 --> 02:09:10,487
..made of stones and
is four feet high.

1282
02:09:11,043 --> 02:09:15,219
To break it, it'll take about
4 to 5 hours and 2 people.

1283
02:09:15,380 --> 02:09:19,954
It's the job of a specialist.
So Ranveer will go with you.

1284
02:09:22,054 --> 02:09:25,035
But that's impossible. Without
special permission..

1285
02:09:25,190 --> 02:09:26,567
..no one can enter the
cantonment area.

1286
02:09:27,059 --> 02:09:29,039
And then what will I tell Jaylu?

1287
02:09:31,063 --> 02:09:34,044
Why will he leave us alone in
his barrack for such a long time?

1288
02:09:36,201 --> 02:09:38,909
Juley, the Major has a remedy
for this problem.

1289
02:09:39,071 --> 02:09:42,052
Tomorrow, you'll have to
pretend to marry Ranveer..

1290
02:09:42,207 --> 02:09:43,242
..in front of the village folk.

1291
02:10:21,313 --> 02:10:22,291
Papers, please.

1292
02:10:28,120 --> 02:10:32,091
Aha, you are the husband?
Congratulations.

1293
02:10:32,257 --> 02:10:38,105
Your husband is a colourful
guy. Happy honeymoon.

1294
02:10:47,472 --> 02:10:49,315
Juley is coming to the barracks
for her honeymoon.

1295
02:10:49,474 --> 02:10:51,181
Okay, let her come, brother.

1296
02:10:57,149 --> 02:10:59,322
Your face, your magic..

1297
02:11:00,352 --> 02:11:03,595
Your face, your magic..

1298
02:11:05,090 --> 02:11:08,264
Allah is my benefactor..

1299
02:11:08,427 --> 02:11:12,398
Allah is my benefactor..

1300
02:11:14,099 --> 02:11:16,943
Your chapeau, your
sunglasses..

1301
02:11:17,102 --> 02:11:21,073
Your chapeau, your
sunglasses..

1302
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:25,347
Allah is my benefactor..

1303
02:11:25,510 --> 02:11:29,959
Allah is my benefactor..

1304
02:11:40,125 --> 02:11:43,629
The kohl in your
eyes is fragrant..

1305
02:11:44,129 --> 02:11:47,440
The flowers in your
braid are fragrant.

1306
02:11:53,138 --> 02:11:56,449
The kohl in your
eyes is fragrant..

1307
02:11:56,608 --> 02:12:00,579
The flowers in your
braid are fragrant.

1308
02:12:02,080 --> 02:12:08,326
You bumblebee, don't
come near..

1309
02:12:08,487 --> 02:12:10,330
You're flirting with me.

1310
02:12:10,489 --> 02:12:13,595
Your smile is my doom..

1311
02:12:14,092 --> 02:12:18,131
It's a nuisance to meet you.

1312
02:12:18,297 --> 02:12:22,439
Allah is my benefactor..

1313
02:12:22,601 --> 02:12:26,606
Allah is my benefactor..

1314
02:13:01,073 --> 02:13:04,247
The weather today is lovely..

1315
02:13:04,409 --> 02:13:08,585
I have got your company..

1316
02:13:14,086 --> 02:13:17,397
The weather today is lovely..

1317
02:13:17,556 --> 02:13:21,936
I have got your company..

1318
02:13:22,094 --> 02:13:24,131
Let it be night..

1319
02:13:24,296 --> 02:13:30,440
Leave my hand, let me go.

1320
02:13:30,602 --> 02:13:35,073
I have found my Juleyt..

1321
02:13:35,240 --> 02:13:39,620
Your condition is like
that of Romeo.

1322
02:13:40,112 --> 02:13:43,958
Allah is my benefactor..

1323
02:13:44,116 --> 02:13:48,121
Allah is my benefactor..

1324
02:13:55,127 --> 02:13:56,003
Welcome, sir.

1325
02:14:00,132 --> 02:14:03,579
One moment. Come on, darling.
My husband.

1326
02:14:43,208 --> 02:14:44,186
Brother..

1327
02:14:44,342 --> 02:14:48,347
Juley, my beautiful little
sister. Congratulations.

1328
02:14:48,513 --> 02:14:49,958
I was waiting for you.

1329
02:14:50,115 --> 02:14:51,492
Brother, this is my husband.

1330
02:14:55,454 --> 02:14:57,627
Hello, what a handsome man.

1331
02:14:59,124 --> 02:15:00,034
Touch my brother's feet.

1332
02:15:02,394 --> 02:15:05,034
Stupid girl, if you wanted him,
you should have told me.

1333
02:15:05,197 --> 02:15:07,040
I would have got you both
married amidst great pomp.

1334
02:15:07,199 --> 02:15:10,180
You can have the pomp now also.
Better late than never.

1335
02:15:10,335 --> 02:15:13,111
No brother, we are
too tired now.

1336
02:15:13,271 --> 02:15:17,583
Jaylu, understand now. Let
them have their honeymoon.

1337
02:15:18,076 --> 02:15:19,054
Definitely.
- Let us go now.

1338
02:15:19,211 --> 02:15:20,986
We could not do anything.
- Doesn't matter.

1339
02:15:21,146 --> 02:15:22,591
Come on.

1340
02:15:40,432 --> 02:15:42,605
Quickly remove all the
tools from in here.

1341
02:15:43,101 --> 02:15:44,079
Give me.

1342
02:15:44,236 --> 02:15:45,943
Quickly, time is short.

1343
02:16:37,088 --> 02:16:40,069
Oh, my God. Honeymoon doesn't
mean that you leave..

1344
02:16:40,225 --> 02:16:42,933
..the door open. - then you
close the door please.

1345
02:16:43,094 --> 02:16:48,066
Tell me if you felt as if a
wall was being cut. Drilling?

1346
02:16:48,233 --> 02:16:52,340
On honeymoon, walls
are cut only.

1347
02:16:52,504 --> 02:16:54,950
Oh, keep it up! But remember,
whatever you do..

1348
02:16:55,106 --> 02:16:56,278
..do it with the door closed.

1349
02:16:56,441 --> 02:16:59,081
Oh, you please close the door.

1350
02:17:00,178 --> 02:17:01,213
Okay, right.

1351
02:17:23,535 --> 02:17:25,572
Hello, Ran reporting. Over.

1352
02:17:28,273 --> 02:17:29,581
Operation B successful.

1353
02:17:30,075 --> 02:17:31,383
Hello Over.

1354
02:17:31,543 --> 02:17:32,920
Operation C begins.
Over and out.

1355
02:17:33,078 --> 02:17:34,056
Congratulations!

1356
02:18:01,239 --> 02:18:02,217
Follow me.

1357
02:18:52,090 --> 02:18:55,071
Before everything, we have
to get Dong's secret file..

1358
02:18:55,226 --> 02:18:57,206
..which has the names of
all his agents in India.

1359
02:19:04,035 --> 02:19:08,347
Rakesh, Dong's voice.
Dong's voice.

1360
02:19:10,575 --> 02:19:11,553
Yes, sir-.

1361
02:19:12,043 --> 02:19:14,023
I have just been informed
that they those Indians".

1362
02:19:14,179 --> 02:19:15,214
..have entered into
the barracks.

1363
02:19:15,380 --> 02:19:19,556
You take all your guards from
here to behind the barracks.

1364
02:19:20,051 --> 02:19:21,553
But sir?

1365
02:19:22,053 --> 02:19:23,031
Dong is never wrong. Get
out from here and..

1366
02:19:23,188 --> 02:19:24,565
..await my orders.

1367
02:19:29,060 --> 02:19:31,370
Captain, reach behind the
barracks with your guards.

1368
02:19:31,529 --> 02:19:33,907
Okay, Colonel, okay.
Come on, follow me.

1369
02:19:37,335 --> 02:19:41,909
Listen Juley, you reach
Mrs. D'Costa's house.

1370
02:19:42,073 --> 02:19:43,575
We shall also reach there
with the secret file.

1371
02:19:44,075 --> 02:19:45,247
Yes sir-.

1372
02:19:47,212 --> 02:19:48,190
Hurry "P!

1373
02:19:51,082 --> 02:19:52,925
Ranveer, I want to
tell you something.

1374
02:19:53,084 --> 02:19:55,928
I saw that in your eyes without
you having to tell me.

1375
02:19:56,087 --> 02:19:57,065
Ranveer!

1376
02:21:50,201 --> 02:21:51,646
Major, Major, we got the file.

1377
02:21:58,142 --> 02:22:02,921
Defence Secretary lyengar,
Dong's agent? Oh, no!

1378
02:22:06,351 --> 02:22:08,922
Rakesh, you transmit this
message to India immediately.

1379
02:22:13,091 --> 02:22:15,594
Good, my love. Oh, my darling.

1380
02:22:18,429 --> 02:22:22,935
Now not only in this life,
but in every life..

1381
02:22:23,101 --> 02:22:24,079
..l shall make you my empress.

1382
02:22:24,235 --> 02:22:28,081
You have not only found out
who is the helper of these..

1383
02:22:28,239 --> 02:22:32,085
--Indians like Prince Kao, but
also according to my plan--.

1384
02:22:32,243 --> 02:22:36,214
..gave them a fake file
with fake names.

1385
02:22:36,381 --> 02:22:40,227
Sir, those foolish Indians,
at that very moment..

1386
02:22:40,385 --> 02:22:43,229
..instead of you and Mr.
Kapoor sent the names..

1387
02:22:43,388 --> 02:22:46,460
..of your enemies to India
via their transmitters.

1388
02:22:48,126 --> 02:22:52,097
And now, when India will hang
patriots like lyengar..

1389
02:22:52,263 --> 02:22:56,109
..taking them to be my stooges,
then how the souls..

1390
02:22:56,267 --> 02:23:00,044
..of my 2000 men who died
in the hospital disaster..

1391
02:23:00,204 --> 02:23:06,246
..will find their peace.
Good Cynthia, good.

1392
02:23:06,411 --> 02:23:09,984
Sir, I am not the sole deserver
of this credit.

1393
02:23:10,148 --> 02:23:13,925
There is a part of my
confidante in this..

1394
02:23:14,085 --> 02:23:15,063
..Jaylu's sister, Juley.

1395
02:23:24,529 --> 02:23:25,599
Long live Dong!

1396
02:23:30,101 --> 02:23:33,082
General, Indian terrorists
are hiding right now..

1397
02:23:33,237 --> 02:23:36,081
..in Mrs. D'Costa's house.
An attack there will mean..

1398
02:23:36,240 --> 02:23:39,084
..another disaster
like the hospital..

1399
02:23:39,243 --> 02:23:41,223
..because they still have
a lot of ammunition yet.

1400
02:23:44,115 --> 02:23:47,096
Jaylu, your sister is very
clever. Till the time..

1401
02:23:47,251 --> 02:23:50,095
..they have ammunition it
is difficult to kill them..

1402
02:23:50,254 --> 02:23:52,029
..so we'll have to
do another thing.

1403
02:23:59,130 --> 02:24:03,044
Come on Juley. Your first task
when you get the chance.

1404
02:24:03,201 --> 02:24:06,045
To swap their real ammunition
with this fake ammunition.

1405
02:24:06,204 --> 02:24:07,182
Okay.

1406
02:24:07,338 --> 02:24:09,409
So that they could be
terminated easily.

1407
02:24:11,075 --> 02:24:13,316
Okay.
- Thanks and all the best.

1408
02:24:22,086 --> 02:24:23,394
Juley, it seems someone
has seen us.

1409
02:24:23,554 --> 02:24:25,932
You hold the bag behind. I'll
be right back. - Okay.

1410
02:24:28,092 --> 02:24:32,438
Kao uncle, Kao uncle, Juley
aunty is a traitor.

1411
02:24:37,435 --> 02:24:38,436
Why are you silent?

1412
02:24:38,603 --> 02:24:41,015
Speak, speak, speak!

1413
02:24:45,109 --> 02:24:48,113
Oh my God! Young Master,
hello, hello..

1414
02:24:48,279 --> 02:24:50,486
Oh my God, no!

1415
02:24:54,118 --> 02:24:55,096
Vicky!

1416
02:25:07,065 --> 02:25:11,036
This cannot be! This cannot be!

1417
02:25:14,072 --> 02:25:18,043
This has happened, Mrs.
D'Costa. This has happened.

1418
02:25:22,413 --> 02:25:26,259
The enemy is not anyone else,
but our own friend..

1419
02:25:26,417 --> 02:25:32,424
..a member of our own
party, our Juley.

1420
02:25:37,095 --> 02:25:39,405
Yes, she is Cynthia's stooge.

1421
02:25:42,300 --> 02:25:47,443
In fact, even your coming
here is not your plan..

1422
02:25:47,605 --> 02:25:49,949
..but it is a dangerous
plan hatched by..

1423
02:25:50,108 --> 02:25:51,086
..her and Cynthia.

1424
02:25:51,242 --> 02:25:52,619
What are you saying?

1425
02:25:53,111 --> 02:25:54,613
Ask her if this is true or not?

1426
02:25:58,449 --> 02:25:59,951
This is true that I'm
Cynthia's stooge.

1427
02:26:02,386 --> 02:26:05,094
In order to take your
messages to them..

1428
02:26:05,256 --> 02:26:07,236
..l even pretended
to befriend you.

1429
02:26:09,060 --> 02:26:11,370
But I do not know
how Vicky died.

1430
02:26:15,066 --> 02:26:17,910
Mrs. D'Costa, please believe
me. Please believe me.

1431
02:26:18,069 --> 02:26:19,912
Stop this playacting,
you traitor!

1432
02:26:20,071 --> 02:26:25,180
We have been deceived in
such a bitter manner..

1433
02:26:26,344 --> 02:26:29,188
..because we believed you.
Was this the reason..

1434
02:26:29,347 --> 02:26:32,328
..why you taught this small
child lessons of heroism?

1435
02:26:32,483 --> 02:26:33,461
Traitor! Your deceit has made
this little soldier of Dongri-La..

1436
02:26:33,618 --> 02:26:34,596
..immortal even after death.
But you have died..

1437
02:26:35,086 --> 02:26:36,258
..even when you are alive.

1438
02:26:42,093 --> 02:26:43,595
Anyway sir, now what
do we do of Juley?

1439
02:27:37,081 --> 02:27:43,430
Juley, there is only one
punishment of deceit.

1440
02:27:43,588 --> 02:27:46,432
Ranveer, Ranveer, listen to me.

1441
02:27:46,591 --> 02:27:47,592
Please Ranveer..

1442
02:27:56,100 --> 02:28:01,209
Ranveer, what is this
you have done?

1443
02:28:01,372 --> 02:28:07,550
I tried to tell you before
also. Before I could tell you..

1444
02:28:10,047 --> 02:28:16,555
..you did this. It is true that
as per Cynthia's plan..

1445
02:28:17,054 --> 02:28:21,161
..l wanted to trap you
in Dong's cantonment.

1446
02:28:22,393 --> 02:28:27,103
But, since I got your love,
since you put vermillion..

1447
02:28:27,265 --> 02:28:33,307
..in my head, the pretence of
friendship turned into love.

1448
02:28:33,471 --> 02:28:36,452
I realised the difference
between good and evil.

1449
02:28:40,278 --> 02:28:44,590
Dong wanted to attack you
here. But before that..

1450
02:28:50,087 --> 02:28:55,594
..he wanted to swap your
ammunition with fake ones.

1451
02:28:56,093 --> 02:29:01,270
But I thought of duping
General Dong.

1452
02:29:03,100 --> 02:29:05,944
I will not change
your ammunition.

1453
02:29:10,041 --> 02:29:14,285
If I'd changed, then this
bullet would also have been fake.

1454
02:29:24,055 --> 02:29:27,901
So I have shown my loyalty.
You too show your loyalty.

1455
02:29:28,059 --> 02:29:32,906
Win this war! Win
this war, Ranveer.

1456
02:29:34,065 --> 02:29:35,100
Juley!

1457
02:29:58,089 --> 02:30:03,937
Don't stop me, let me go home.

1458
02:30:07,098 --> 02:30:13,481
Don't take my hand,
let me go now.

1459
02:30:25,116 --> 02:30:31,624
Become crazy today..

1460
02:30:48,139 --> 02:30:50,983
You will have to pay for
Juley's deceitfulness.

1461
02:30:54,145 --> 02:30:56,125
This is unfair. Leave me.

1462
02:31:06,624 --> 02:31:07,602
Set..

1463
02:31:10,528 --> 02:31:11,506
Aim..

1464
02:31:16,634 --> 02:31:17,612
Fire!

1465
02:31:47,264 --> 02:31:49,369
Did you see the reward
of being loyal to Dong?

1466
02:31:51,335 --> 02:31:53,110
Now shall we go under
the umbrella?

1467
02:31:55,272 --> 02:31:55,682
They have released Cynthia
and taken her with them.

1468
02:31:57,475 --> 02:31:59,045
Now they can reach the
function at any time.

1469
02:32:04,081 --> 02:32:07,062
Put your guards at every
nook of the cantonment..

1470
02:32:07,218 --> 02:32:10,995
..seal all the routes leading
to the cantonment.

1471
02:32:11,155 --> 02:32:13,601
As soon as you see them,
shoot them all.

1472
02:32:14,091 --> 02:32:15,126
Shoot them at sight!

1473
02:32:15,292 --> 02:32:19,434
General sir, I advise you to
cancel the function itself.

1474
02:32:23,434 --> 02:32:26,415
This is the new security plan
prepared for the mission.

1475
02:32:26,570 --> 02:32:27,548
Take a look.

1476
02:32:42,119 --> 02:32:44,099
Through this tunnel, we can
easily reach the water tank..

1477
02:32:44,255 --> 02:32:45,233
..but from there to reach
the function ground..

1478
02:32:45,389 --> 02:32:46,629
..it will be very difficult.

1479
02:32:47,124 --> 02:32:48,102
You do not worry about that.

1480
02:32:51,128 --> 02:32:52,971
Let the function begin!

1481
02:33:17,087 --> 02:33:18,065
Thanks.

1482
02:34:20,084 --> 02:34:22,325
General sir, general sir,
there's a big problem.

1483
02:34:22,486 --> 02:34:23,931
They were successful in
breaking the barrier.

1484
02:38:40,577 --> 02:38:43,217
Dong.. you are wrong, isn't it?
Tell me.. you dog.. tell me!

1485
02:39:01,498 --> 02:39:06,243
Dong is never wrong. You
are wrong, Dharamsingh.

1486
02:39:06,570 --> 02:39:09,881
You think that you
are a great spy?

1487
02:39:11,008 --> 02:39:12,248
You didn't even think..

1488
02:39:12,576 --> 02:39:17,025
The Dong who can come to India and
give birth to a duplicate Dong..

1489
02:39:17,180 --> 02:39:20,889
..he can prepare his duplicate
in Dongrlia too.

1490
02:39:22,052 --> 02:39:24,259
The one who is lying
half dead there..

1491
02:39:24,421 --> 02:39:27,595
..he isn't me, he is
the duplicate Dong.

1492
02:39:40,037 --> 02:39:44,452
Dongrila's emperor. The
real Dong is here.

1493
02:40:01,558 --> 02:40:05,404
Have you brought any
bomb or cannon..

1494
02:40:05,562 --> 02:40:06,597
..which can reach till the Dong!

1495
02:40:08,532 --> 02:40:10,637
Your lame major had a mission..

1496
02:40:11,101 --> 02:40:16,141
..to kill Dong today
and show the world.

1497
02:40:16,306 --> 02:40:20,652
Then show the world. The
annual day is over.

1498
02:40:21,712 --> 02:40:23,055
See.

1499
02:40:23,213 --> 02:40:27,286
In some time, the sun of
India's respect will drown.

1500
02:40:30,787 --> 02:40:33,961
You think that you are
great by vanquishing..

1501
02:40:34,124 --> 02:40:37,162
..just a demonstration
of my security?

1502
02:40:38,428 --> 02:40:42,205
The real trap of my
security is here!

1503
02:40:48,739 --> 02:40:49,979
LOOK.

1504
02:40:53,377 --> 02:40:54,981
LOOK.

1505
02:41:01,284 --> 02:41:03,992
And look at this! Did you see
how Dong changes the air?

1506
02:41:04,154 --> 02:41:05,963
You think that you are the peak.

1507
02:41:06,123 --> 02:41:08,330
The air is on your side?

1508
02:41:08,692 --> 02:41:12,265
It doesn't take much time
for the air to change face.

1509
02:41:25,108 --> 02:41:28,146
Bomb as much as you want.
They won't reach me.

1510
02:41:32,382 --> 02:41:33,952
They will not be
able to reach me!

1511
02:41:45,295 --> 02:41:50,540
Run! Run! There is fire! Run!

1512
02:41:50,701 --> 02:41:54,979
Fire! Run!

1513
02:42:02,179 --> 02:42:04,921
Run.. till where
can you run? Run!

1514
02:42:38,448 --> 02:42:39,950
Why are you going back?
Come, you wretch!

1515
02:43:19,122 --> 02:43:21,295
Break his bones!

1516
02:43:23,727 --> 02:43:27,675
Did you see us Indians? Did you?

1517
02:43:32,636 --> 02:43:35,617
Why? You were barking
like a dog.

1518
02:43:35,772 --> 02:43:36,944
What did you say?

1519
02:43:37,107 --> 02:43:39,986
India's respect's sun
was about to drown?

1520
02:43:41,111 --> 02:43:43,387
Your life's sun is about
to drown today.

1521
02:43:44,548 --> 02:43:46,186
Listen to this before you die.

1522
02:43:47,150 --> 02:43:49,096
Just six Indians
have shown this.

1523
02:43:49,252 --> 02:43:50,526
Think..

1524
02:43:50,687 --> 02:43:52,633
If eighty crore get up..

1525
02:43:53,190 --> 02:43:55,966
What about you.. even
the biggest..

1526
02:43:56,126 --> 02:43:59,198
..of despotic rulers
will have to run.

1527
02:44:00,263 --> 02:44:02,903
Rascal! Dog!

1528
02:44:05,068 --> 02:44:07,480
Did you know the power
of Indian soldiers?

1529
02:44:09,039 --> 02:44:10,279
Hit him!

1530
02:44:49,646 --> 02:44:53,059
After this, Major Krishnarads
small".

1531
02:44:53,216 --> 02:44:56,356
..army didn't have just
Dolly released..

1532
02:44:57,621 --> 02:45:00,067
..but it released all
the innocent girls..

1533
02:45:00,223 --> 02:45:05,502
..and gave them a new life,
who were imprisoned by Dong.

1534
02:45:09,165 --> 02:45:15,309
Boys.. so you have the
top secret file.

1535
02:45:17,173 --> 02:45:18,151
Yes.

1536
02:45:18,308 --> 02:45:21,221
Did you look at the first page?

1537
02:45:24,080 --> 02:45:26,651
ls my name there?
- Yes, sir.

1538
02:45:27,083 --> 02:45:29,359
And if that is printed
in the papers..

1539
02:45:29,519 --> 02:45:32,363
..there will really be a ruckus
in the country, isn't it?

1540
02:45:32,522 --> 02:45:33,626
Yes.

1541
02:45:35,191 --> 02:45:39,105
So, this message shouldn't
be printed, isn't it?

1542
02:45:39,262 --> 02:45:40,536
Yes, sir-.

1543
02:45:40,697 --> 02:45:42,233
Get ready to die.

1544
02:45:45,268 --> 02:45:48,511
Nothing personal. Just business.

1545
02:45:57,180 --> 02:46:00,457
If you want to shoot,
shoot. Don't talk.

1546
02:46:02,018 --> 02:46:05,363
It's just business.
Nothing personal.

1547
02:46:08,391 --> 02:46:09,893
Fatso-.

1548
02:46:10,060 --> 02:46:12,062
The traitor.

1549
02:46:14,497 --> 02:46:16,477
If Major Krishnarao's
force five..

1550
02:46:16,633 --> 02:46:20,080
..gave the country of
Dong a gift of death..

1551
02:46:20,236 --> 02:46:24,412
..the Indian army
gave the highest..

1552
02:46:24,574 --> 02:46:28,215
..level of to him
after his death.

1553
02:46:28,378 --> 02:46:31,951
And Dharamsingh got
his lost pride.
