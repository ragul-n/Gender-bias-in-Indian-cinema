1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:03,542
23.976

2
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:29,249
Fun and excitement...

3
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,665
all the fun and excitement

4
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:36,042
"Is it love, or a battle?
A colour you can’t see..."

5
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:40,084
"I can figure out nothing, Lord!"

6
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,042
"Everyone’s all tied up,
what predicament is this?"

7
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:17,209
"They walk together,
and yetis there a tussle"

8
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:24,209
To make them see reason...

9
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:28,333
"is difficult
to make them see reason"

10
00:02:28,334 --> 00:02:31,833
"The actors that perform
in this play..."

11
00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:35,583
they do perform a drama

12
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:54,291
Fun and excitement...

13
00:02:54,292 --> 00:03:00,542
all the fun and excitement

14
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:23,958
Hurry! It’s time for school

15
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:39,582
Jungle! Rascal! Idiot!
- Step on the brakes!

16
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,916
"You’re a girl, and you abuse me?
- You want me to applaud you?"

17
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:45,167
Why did you push me?
- When did I? You ran into me

18
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,916
You deliberately rammed into me
and now you’re talking back!

19
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:51,959
I know roadside loafers like you.
You see a girl and get into the act!

20
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:55,083
Watch your tongue! You broke
the button on my shirt...

21
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:58,541
and now you’re calling me a loafer?
Where will I get a button from?

22
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:02,125
How about the dress which you spoilt?
You know what the laundry bill comes to?

23
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,917
Can’t you wash your own clothes?
- Had I the time...

24
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:09,750
"I’d show you what else I can wash.
- Go, get lost"

25
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:15,292
"Get going!
- Go, go away"

26
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:24,582
God! I didn’t know
you’d have such daring

27
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:28,083
You came away to Mumbai without
telling anyone at home

28
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:31,374
What would you have done
if I wasn’t here?

29
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:34,749
It didn’t occur to me at all.
Had I stayed there another day...

30
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,582
my mother would’ve got me married
to the local landlord’s son

31
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,875
"So what’s wrong? You have to
marry someone, don’t you?"

32
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:44,666
But that chap’s a nut.
He’s a real moron

33
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:47,666
My father had borrowed a lot of money
from his father...

34
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:50,666
for my education and for
my mother’s treatment

35
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:53,415
My father died under
the burden of the debt...

36
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,666
"and he’s now pestering my mother.
He says, if you can’t repay the debt..."

37
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:58,999
have your daughter married
to my son

38
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,749
He doesn’t even want any dowry.
- You mean your life is...

39
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,332
the sum total of the debt
and the interest

40
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:08,875
So what do you want to do?
- I must find a job at any cost

41
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,791
I’ve got to repay the debt
and get rid of the landlord

42
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:16,750
"Any job will do.
- Easier said than done, Anjali"

43
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,415
I’m living here with a friend
who’s an air-hostess

44
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:24,333
"She’ll be here by 10:30 next Friday.
Till then, you can stay here"

45
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:28,375
"But once she arrives, it’ll be
difficult for you to live here"

46
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,541
"I’m sorry, but you mustn’t
take that badly, Anjali"

47
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,791
I’ve got enough money to see me
through a couple of months

48
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,875
If only I could find a room
till I find a job

49
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:41,917
Let’s see what we can do.
I’m getting late. I must leave

50
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,333
When love is one-sided...

51
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,083
it’s a punishment

52
00:06:03,084 --> 00:06:09,583
"When love is requited,
it’s fun"

53
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:16,583
Quiet! We’re talking about life
and death and you’re hollering away!

54
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,415
"Come around, darling.
- No"

55
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:23,250
So it has to do with love!
I’ll sing a romantic number...

56
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:28,250
the lady will immediately agree.
- I’ve agreed. For a divorce

57
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,084
I’m not giving it to you!
- I’ve got great number for divorce...

58
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,959
but it’s a bit romantic and...
- Sing it for your wife!

59
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,874
Now sing a song for losses!

60
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:48,125
You’re more of a mosquito repellent!
You’ve been driving the customers away

61
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,457
"I’ll be a great singer some day, sir.
That is my dream"

62
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,833
"Pipe-dream. Go away
- Today’s the 4th., sir..."

63
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:58,791
When did I say it’s the 34th?
- My salary...?

64
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:01,833
I have it all worked out.
300 bucks. Let me have it

65
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:05,250
"But we settled at 4000 rupees.
- Sure, we did"

66
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,333
You do get a salary of 4000.
But who pays for your stay here?

67
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,749
Who pays for your food
and your laundry?

68
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,667
It works out to 4300. Your salary’s
4000. So let me have 300 rupees

69
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,457
"But this is a fraud, sir!
- Really?"

70
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:26,917
So go and find another job.
Get lost!

71
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,000
Hey Bholu! Your milk’s getting
thinner and thinner every day

72
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,791
Are you pouring water in it?

73
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:37,708
"I swear, I’ve never
adulterated milk with water"

74
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,582
"But yes, I do adulterate
water with milk"

75
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,916
"Buy it, if you can afford it.
Or forget it"

76
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:47,542
"Hello, Nandu! How are you?
Why don’t you sing a song as usual?"

77
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:52,041
"Sing, my foot! I’ve heard the
mosquitoes singing all night"

78
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:55,582
Don’t you have a mosquito net
in the room?

79
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,791
"Forget a mosquito net, it doesn’t
even have a roof and walls"

80
00:07:57,792 --> 00:08:01,125
I slept on the railway platform.
- You must think of me at such times

81
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:04,667
I have a great place.
It’s going cheap

82
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,791
But you’ll need to pay me
a commission for that

83
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:12,125
500 rupees.
- I will. But where is it?

84
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:14,624
I’ll show you... do you have a wife?
- Wife?!

85
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:20,458
"You know Popat, the moneylender?
He lets out his room very cheap"

86
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,041
But only to married couples.
- Why?

87
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:30,208
Because his wife’s an amazing dish.
He’s terribly suspicious about her

88
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,791
Where will I find a wife?
- Am I not here?

89
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:37,250
You’re crazy! If I tell Popat
that you’re my wife...

90
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:44,542
What rubbish! What I’m saying is
that I’ll find you a wife

91
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:48,417
I’ll charge extra commission for that.
- Are you a milkman...

92
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:52,458
or a commission agent?
- I’m an all rounder

93
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:59,042
You indeed are a fast guy

94
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,999
Where’s the other lady?
- She’s taking a bath

95
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,417
Quickly take the milk.
I’ve got work to do

96
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,624
"You’re the one I was waiting for, Bholu.
- What is the matter?"

97
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,916
"That’s my friend, Anjali.
She’s looking for a room"

98
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:26,417
Low rent. Will you find one?
- There is a room. Very cheap

99
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,957
But only for married couples

100
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,582
Are you married?
- No

101
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,958
She doesn’t know anyone in town.
But Bholu knows everyone

102
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,874
"Bholu, Bholu the good boy...
- That’s enough"

103
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,999
Will you give me a commission?
- I will

104
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,041
"All right, I’ll find a
fake-husband for her then"

105
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,416
So you’re thinking of
leaving your house?

106
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:52,542
Strange games God plays.
Here I am...

107
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:57,542
waiting to quit the dingy hole I’m
living in and settling in a palace

108
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,708
And you! You’re quitting
a readymade palace

109
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:02,915
If you had a father like mine...

110
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:06,666
you’d have found my palace to be
smaller than your dingy hole

111
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:09,875
But what is the problem?
- Ever since I’ve finished college...

112
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,875
I’ve been begging for money
to start a business

113
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:18,082
"Whenever I talk about money, it’s
as if I’ve stepped on his tail!"

114
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,124
"This is the limit!
- You have just one way, my friend"

115
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:24,082
Change your father.
- What?

116
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:28,709
"Woo a rich girl, get married and
become the heir to her father’s riches"

117
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:32,040
You’re poking fun at me?
- I’m not kidding

118
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:36,375
"I’ve even scored with a girl.
Teja, the garbage king’s daughter"

119
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,916
"You’ve heard of him, haven’t you?
It’s his only daughter. Madhuri"

120
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:43,708
The garbage king’s daughter and you?
Don’t forget your status

121
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,999
Do you even have the money to buy
her a box to collect the garbage?

122
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,584
"I don’t, but Radhesham Tiwari"s
son can buy even the garbage king..."

123
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,333
not just a garbage can.
- Tiwari? Owner of Anjali Industries?

124
00:10:56,792 --> 00:11:00,082
"Right. Anjali Foods, Anjali Chemicals,
Anjali Pharmaceuticals..."

125
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,749
and several other Anjali"s
under my father’s belt

126
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,791
You told her that you are
Radhesham Tiwari"s son?

127
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:07,791
"Yes. Don’t lose hope, my friend"

128
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,999
"The more thick-skinned you are in money
matters, the better it is for you"

129
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,999
Harass your father so much
with your demands...

130
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,499
he’ll give you something
some day or the other

131
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,332
"Dad, one last time. Are you giving
me the money or aren’t you?"

132
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,999
You’ve been asking me for years
and I didn’t give you anything

133
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,082
Here you are. Start whatever
business you want to with this

134
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,500
10 rupees! You’re poking fun at me?
- Hear that?

135
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:33,709
He thinks 10 rupees is too little!
My grandfather ran the family with it

136
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:37,082
My father arrived in this city
with just 10 rupees

137
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:40,082
And this is just what I got
in my dowry

138
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,082
"Ma, say something. Please.
- What will I say, my son?"

139
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:46,167
I asked him for a diamond necklace.
He didn’t give that to me either

140
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:50,459
He sold the land in the village
yesterday. He got eight million

141
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,832
"Let alone taking a look, I didn’t
even get to smell the money"

142
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:57,292
He’s put it all in the safe.
- Shout! Yell as much as you want to

143
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,832
There’s eight million
lying in the house...

144
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:05,250
"and you refuse to give me 750,000?
- I spend a lot of money..."

145
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,207
"in your education, boarding
and maintenance"

146
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,790
You aren’t getting a penny more

147
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,249
"Who will give me the money,
if not you, Papa?"

148
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,874
What will I do?
- Rob and steal

149
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:19,375
But don’t ask me for the money.
- I can’t take it anymore

150
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,124
"If you don’t give me the money,
I’m leaving this house"

151
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:27,500
"Sure, go away.
- I’m leaving!"

152
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:33,125
I’ve made enquiries. Radhesham Tiwari"s
bungalow in Pali Hill is lying vacant

153
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:35,790
There’s no one there
except a care-taker

154
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,124
"When the garbage king gets to know,
he’ll put you through a ringer!"

155
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:41,459
I’ll marry Madhuri
before he does that

156
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,124
"Once the marriage has
taken place, it’ll all be over"

157
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:47,124
He’s the bride’s father.
The only daughter

158
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:51,459
What will he do? He’ll have to
accept me as his son-in-law

159
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,874
Are you out of your mind?

160
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,124
"First tell me what’s to be done
with my father, the villain"

161
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:59,709
Did you ask him for the money?
- Have I been talking in Hebrew?

162
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,666
He’s sitting on his money like a snake.
He won’t give me a penny!

163
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:06,124
What did he have to say?
- He asks me to rob and steal

164
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,458
He’ll fight my case for free.
- Nice idea

165
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:13,999
So rob and steal. Best business.
No capital required

166
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,915
What does he do for a living?
- With a tanpura around his neck...

167
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:20,124
he goes around singing.
- You mean he’s a beggar!

168
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:23,375
"I’ll have to live with a beggar?
- No beggar, a large-hearted man"

169
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:27,999
Here he comes

170
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,124
"Sorry, I’m late"

171
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,124
You?
- You!

172
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,124
So you know each other? That’s good.
There won’t be any problem then

173
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,207
I’m not staying with this thug!

174
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,957
You think I’ll willingly
move in with a witch?

175
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:45,207
"You call me a witch?
- No, you are a witch’s mother..."

176
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:49,249
"a grandmother, everything.
You’re from a family of witches!"

177
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,915
"Priya, let’s go.
- Anjali..."

178
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,915
don’t act like a child.
My roommate is arriving tomorrow

179
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:59,207
You must some how find a place!
Adjust with him for now...

180
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:02,542
"later, we’ll find another place.
- Hey boss... listen to me"

181
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,458
"In Bombay, you got to pay
even to sleep on the pavements"

182
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:09,750
"And that’s so dangerous. If someone
drives over, you’re dead and gone"

183
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,082
"Bholu, she agrees.
- So does he"

184
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:16,791
"According to Popat"s condition, the two
of you must look like a married couple"

185
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:21,083
So here’s the bridal necklace.
That will cost another 50 rupees

186
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:23,957
"Here, put it on her"

187
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,999
Hey! I’m not letting any Tom Dick
or Harry put the necklace on me

188
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,915
Let me put it on you then

189
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:33,125
She’s waiting for a prince
to come along. Give it to her

190
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:39,625
One minute. I’ll put it on her

191
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,583
"Popat-Seth, save my life!"

192
00:14:47,584 --> 00:14:51,875
"What’s the matter, Waghmare?
- I caught a thief with 50,000 rupees"

193
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,875
"But I’m diabetic, you see.
I went to take a leak..."

194
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,791
and the thief escaped with the money.
- How?

195
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:05,791
I have decided. I’m not going to
trust a thief ever again

196
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:11,250
That’s right.
- You know what Inspector Rane says?

197
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:16,583
"He says I took 50,000 from the thief
and I helped him escape!"

198
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,250
Rane has gone an filed a First
Information Report against me!

199
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,583
Do you I think I’m that sort of a man?
- This is the first time...

200
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,542
"I’m hearing of something like this.
- If I don’t keep 50,000..."

201
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:34,875
"on Rane"s table, I’ll lose my job!
- No, I’ll give you the money"

202
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,542
But I’ll charge 10 per cent interest.
- Why 10 per cent?

203
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:41,999
I’ll return all the money to you.
I swear!

204
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,416
I’ll take all the money.
But my interest will be 10 per cent

205
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:48,625
10 per cent?
- Yes

206
00:15:49,042 --> 00:15:54,041
"And you’ll have to pawn something too.
- Sure, I’ve brought it"

207
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:57,458
The papers of my room
and the stamp papers

208
00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:00,833
How often have I told you?
Go inside!

209
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:06,709
You see a stranger around
and you come running!

210
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:14,249
"Look, they’ve arrived"

211
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,999
When did you get married?
- Very recently

212
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
"And you said...
- It’s quite some time, really"

213
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,541
"You don’t eat non-veg food, do you?
- No"

214
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:29,124
"You won’t leave each other
and run away, will you?"

215
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:34,917
"Are you in a cattle market, sir?
Why worry about such detail?"

216
00:16:35,334 --> 00:16:38,540
"Let me make it clear.
She’s the wife, he’s the husband"

217
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:42,250
"Give them the keys, and the
commission to me. You get that?"

218
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,458
"You’ve brought the advance?
- Sure, here it is"

219
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:48,333
All right. You can stay here
from today itself

220
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:50,333
"Dulari, show them to their room"

221
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:54,542
"Murder of an elderly couple
for money. Servant arrested"

222
00:16:55,334 --> 00:17:00,250
See this? When I asked you to do all
the chores and not employ servants...

223
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:04,124
what did you say to me?
That I’m a miser

224
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,458
But look at what you get when
you employ servants!

225
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:09,041
You’ll sleep at home
and wake up in hell!

226
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:13,333
"Oh yes, nice heaven
I’m living with you in"

227
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:16,124
"Jeetu, my son!
You’ve come back!"

228
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:21,917
"The way you left, I thought you’d
never look back at this house again"

229
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:25,333
Well? You went broke and
missed the free food?

230
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:29,917
Have a couple of morsels if you wish.
But you’re not getting a penny!

231
00:17:30,334 --> 00:17:34,042
"Daddy, I’m here to seek your
blessings and sweeten your tongue"

232
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,416
I’ve started a new business.
- Really? What business?

233
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:42,292
"Electronics, Mother. DVD players,
CD players... it’s a big showroom"

234
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:46,750
"It must’ve taken a lot of investment?
- I invested 750,000..."

235
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:50,249
and the bank financed me
with the rest of the 6 million

236
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,540
"750,000 rupees?
Where did you get the money?"

237
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,166
"You are the one who showed me
the right path, daddy"

238
00:17:56,167 --> 00:18:00,000
What path did I show you?
- You asked me to rob and steal

239
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:04,374
So I did

240
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,749
I got to know that there was
a lot of money in a house

241
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,415
I went there in the dead of the night.
The husband and wife were fast asleep

242
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:12,415
"I took the key from under the pillow,
took the money from the safe..."

243
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,750
and kept the keys back!
- They must’ve called the cops by now!

244
00:18:16,209 --> 00:18:19,208
They don’t even know as yet.
But now they’ll discover

245
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:22,457
"But which house did you rob, son?
- This one, Papa"

246
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,666
it’s the money you got from selling
the land? That’s the one I stole

247
00:18:26,084 --> 00:18:29,083
So you robbed your father!
Snake in the grass!

248
00:18:29,084 --> 00:18:32,083
"When I asked him for it, he didn’t
give it to me. He asked me to steal"

249
00:18:32,084 --> 00:18:35,415
Now how could a son
disobey his father?

250
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:38,083
It was unaccounted money anyway.
Let the cops arrive

251
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:40,457
I’ll tell them everything and the
two of us will go to jail together

252
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:43,166
Tell me the truth.
Is he really my son?

253
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:46,374
I’m convinced now!
He’s truly your son!

254
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,249
My darling son...
my good boy aren’t you?

255
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:54,042
"Return Papa"s money, my son!
- That’s not possible"

256
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,249
Are you sure?
- Sure

257
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,375
Get out of this house then!
- That’s what I came for

258
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:07,333
Lord! Protect my son!

259
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,457
I’m told that this house is
to be sublet. Is it true?

260
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:34,125
Not true.
- Who are you?

261
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:37,540
You walk into my house
and ask me who I am?

262
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:43,042
"There was this chap, Pandu...
who used to dust and swab the floor"

263
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,916
Isn’t he there?
- What work is it?

264
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:50,042
It’s in his own interests.
He’d have made an extra buck

265
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,749
"But if he’s not here,
I must leave"

266
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,540
Sir! Sir!
I’m Pandu!

267
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,582
Can’t you believe me...?
Here you are!

268
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:02,708
So this is the real movie!
That was only a trailer?

269
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:07,458
"Pandu"s mysterious ways, sir.
Come on in, sir... welcome"

270
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,249
"This way, please..."

271
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,124
As Lord Krishna says...
how about a small drink?

272
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,457
No.
- I’ll have one

273
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,791
Without any soda or water?
- No

274
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,582
Nothing at all?
- No

275
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,582
The boss has kept
the liquor for guests

276
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,290
But the guests will come
only when the boss is here

277
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:32,209
I didn’t want the booze to get spoilt.
I kept taking small drinks...

278
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:38,583
"and pouring in small amounts of water.
And now, there’s just water in it!"

279
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,209
"Pandu, you’re a very smart man.
- Not at all, sir"

280
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:47,541
"The moment I saw you, I knew
I had met a thief in you"

281
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:51,209
All I wanted to say to you
was that I was as good as you are

282
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,999
You mentioned something about money

283
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,250
"You live here all alone, don’t you?
- Yes..."

284
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:00,875
the boss hasn’t even looked
at this place for years

285
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,917
"Despite being such a rich man,
he lives like a villager"

286
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:09,209
The lawyers and the managers carry
the accounts to him in the village

287
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:13,333
"To pay me a salary, he has maintained
such a big house in the city!"

288
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,209
If you could get some cream
apart from this salary...

289
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,084
what do you think about it?
- Great idea

290
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:25,500
"In that case, Radhesham Tiwari"s son
is living here from tomorrow"

291
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,666
Me

292
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:35,042
Me!

293
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:39,666
First class!

294
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:43,124
"Sheru, is your information accurate?"

295
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:46,250
"Absolutely certain, Garbage King...
I mean, Teja-bhai"

296
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:50,917
Who’s he?
- It’s Radhesham Tiwari"s son

297
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:54,542
Is it the Radhesham Tiwari of the
multi-million Anjali Industries?

298
00:21:54,917 --> 00:21:58,707
"Yes.
- He said, he’ll marry you?"

299
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,666
"Tell me the truth.
Else, I’ll kill you!"

300
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:05,208
He’s been wanting to meet you

301
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:12,583
I swear it on the scales!
You’re really my little girl!

302
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,917
I knew you’d find a gem
even in the garbage!

303
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:24,541
Hey! Get out!
- This is my bed!

304
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:27,415
Your bed? I pay half the
rent of this house!

305
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:32,833
Does the other half
land from the skies?

306
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:39,250
All right. Let’s draw lots
with your name and mine

307
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,083
"Whichever name the chit comes up
with, gets the bed. Okay?"

308
00:22:42,084 --> 00:22:47,167
All right. Go ahead

309
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,166
One moment. I’ll pick it.
- All right. As you wish you

310
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:01,917
Anjali! Now move...
Go away

311
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:08,083
What are you staring for?
Go away

312
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:44,916
Get up... what are you up to?
- What?

313
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:48,124
Can’t you sleep quietly?
- When I lie on the floor...

314
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:51,375
the cold gets to my bones
and I start snoring. Like this

315
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:55,375
it’s more like an explosion!
I need quiet when I sleep!

316
00:23:55,792 --> 00:24:00,250
So go and sleep on the roof!
I can’t sleep quietly on the floor

317
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,749
"All right, go and rot in the bed"

318
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:08,292
"I need peace, not a bed
to sleep on! Go on!"

319
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,999
Pandu...

320
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,791
The garbage!

321
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,250
Wash your eyes!
- It’s the garbage king!

322
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:29,083
Remember what I told you? You won’t get
a penny if you mess up. Hurry up now!

323
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,791
"Hello, sir, hello"

324
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:38,666
Mr. Anil...?
- He’s on the phone

325
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:41,499
Don’t keep calling me
for 15 or 20 million

326
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,791
Take it from the drawer
in my office

327
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:48,041
What happened about the car?
The Ferrari? No way

328
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:51,874
it’s become very common nowadays.
Sachin has one too

329
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:55,791
"I want a Rolls Royce.
Three, in fact"

330
00:24:55,792 --> 00:24:57,582
"One for me, one for my daddy..."

331
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:00,709
and I want to donate one
to my future father-in-law

332
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,791
I’m Teja-bhai.
- Who?

333
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:07,124
The garbage...
- Garbage! Sorry...

334
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:12,709
there’s no garbage here. Go away.
- I’m Madhuri"s father

335
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,542
"Father-in-law! I’m sorry,
I did not recognize you"

336
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:20,875
"it’s okay, you’ll get to know me.
My daughter has told me everything"

337
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:24,709
What a gem my daughter has found!
You’ll make a great couple!

338
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:34,792
So when do we have the marriage?
- As early as possible...

339
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,666
But we’ll have to tell
your parents. Won’t we?

340
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:40,874
That’s the problem

341
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:46,041
My parents want me to marry into
a family of big industrialists

342
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:49,666
They’ve even taken my birth chart.
But I’ve told them in plain terms

343
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:51,916
"If there’s anyone I’ll marry,
it’s Madhuri!"

344
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,666
That’s for sure.
- So what are we to do?

345
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:57,874
"Get married, at the earliest. That’s it.
- And how about your daddy?"

346
00:25:57,875 --> 00:26:00,582
"Once we’re married, what will
he be able to do about it?"

347
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:04,208
"Even if he does, my boss still has
500 million to his name"

348
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:08,583
Till the marriage they all act funny.
They accept everything later

349
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,874
"In your shoes, this is just
what I’d have done, son"

350
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:14,874
That’s why I’ve taken the risk.
Of getting married

351
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:17,541
So let’s have the engagement tomorrow.
You can exchange rings

352
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,874
We’ll find a nice day
and have you married

353
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:22,666
But don’t say a word to your Papa
before all this happens

354
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:24,999
"Come, let’s sweeten our tongues.
- Yes, let’s go"

355
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,041
Only after everything is over
will they get to know the truth

356
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,708
Mr. Sahay from the city is here.
- All right

357
00:26:32,709 --> 00:26:34,915
Tell Ramdin to keep the calf
away from the cow

358
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:40,375
"It drinks up all the milk.
- Very well, madam"

359
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,875
Listen...
- Lovely voice

360
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:54,666
You never said that to me earlier

361
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:59,542
"Not you, my dear woman...
I’m talking about Ustad Aamir Khan."

362
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,250
Will you shut him up now?
There are guests waiting for you

363
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:06,541
How can you say such things
about a luminary like him?

364
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:09,584
I’ve started businesses in your
name all over the world...

365
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,915
and you won’t use your brains at all?

366
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:16,332
Do you have something in your brains?
Or are you bankrupt already?

367
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:21,041
Enough of your songs. Chandrakant
and Renuka are waiting for you

368
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,875
You ought to have told me!
You just keep talking any nonsense

369
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:31,250
"Anjali, you are simply
taking the trouble"

370
00:27:31,709 --> 00:27:35,958
No trouble. You’re more a friend
than an AIDS virus

371
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,625
"Not AIDS virus, Anjali.
She’s an advisor"

372
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,333
Call her a legal advisor!
- It’s the same thing

373
00:27:44,792 --> 00:27:48,584
Is it really? You can’t tell
a bear from a potato!

374
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,584
"In there, I was talking about Aamir
Khan. You must know about him?"

375
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,082
Aamir Khan? Who hasn’t heard of him?
I’m a huge fan of his

376
00:27:56,083 --> 00:28:01,583
See? Now this is
a well-informed man

377
00:28:01,584 --> 00:28:05,000
"As for her, the cattle, the fodder
and the cow dung... that’s her world"

378
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,292
"It isn’t her fault, actually.
It’s your mistake"

379
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,999
You didn’t expose her
to the city at all

380
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,249
How will she know about the world
in the confines of the four walls?

381
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,791
"That’s not the case, sister-in-law.
- That’s how it is"

382
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,999
Why did you send your son
and daughter to London?

383
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,584
I was born in the city and
I will stay here till I die

384
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,459
But it’s different with the children.
They’ve got to keep up with the world...

385
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:31,999
"move ahead in life, so...
- I hope you don’t have to..."

386
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,040
go through what happened
Anandilal Kitpitia did

387
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:37,999
"What happened?
- Like you, Anandilal Kitpitia..."

388
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,584
sent his sons to London. To study.
The old couple lived in the village

389
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:46,375
"The children went on
to become very modern, hi-fi..."

390
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,749
and the old couple were
still raw villagers

391
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,082
When the children returned
from abroad...

392
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:55,082
they couldn’t adjust themselves
to the local conditions

393
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:58,667
They were ashamed of their parents.
Forget living together...

394
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:01,999
they weren’t even willing to
call them Mummy and Daddy

395
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,250
And one day the children screamed
You bloody Indians and went away

396
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:10,874
The children never looked at
their parents again

397
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:14,207
They kept yearning till they died.
- God!

398
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:17,709
"If my children treat me like that,
it’s going to kill me!"

399
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:21,541
I’ve told him so often
to move to the city...

400
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:25,375
"to learn the way of life there.
Let’s go to the city, please"

401
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:29,375
"Even if it’s only for a month.
- All right, don’t be stubborn"

402
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:33,082
Anandilal Katpitia...
- I’ll think about it

403
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:37,500
Give me the papers.
- Here are all the reports

404
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:42,333
I’ll bring the case papers
of Anjali Chemicals next week

405
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:48,250
We must leave now.
- Very well

406
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:52,708
Do call me if you meet Aamir Khan.
I want a photograph taken with him

407
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:57,458
But he’s dead.
- How’s that possible?

408
00:29:57,459 --> 00:30:01,124
"I saw "Lagaan" only recently.
- "Lagaan"?"

409
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:04,833
I’ve been... it’s Ustad Aamir...
have you ever heard him?

410
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,957
Let’s go. We might miss the bus!

411
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:12,875
You are all alike!
Lagaan! What Lagaan?

412
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,207
Saved! The ceremony is over!
- What are you saying?

413
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:27,207
"I say, it’s nice"

414
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:31,958
Ten days later is an auspicious date.
We’ll have the wedding on that day

415
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:40,542
I’m the one who’s eating this paratha.
So you needn’t laugh

416
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:44,791
I don’t need your permission to laugh!
- Those who laugh belong in a loony bin!

417
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:51,207
And broken parathas
belong in the garbage bin!

418
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:54,791
My parathas are neither burnt
nor broken. I’ll eat all I want

419
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,999
Is someone there?

420
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,916
"The man and wife have left the lights
and fans on, to have a honeymoon!"

421
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:05,207
How are you...?
Is everything all right?

422
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:07,207
Any problem?

423
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:10,666
What aroma is that? What’s cooking?
Potato-pancakes?

424
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:12,957
Yes

425
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:16,374
"When we were just married,
Dulari made some for me too"

426
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,915
Her mother died the
moment she ate one

427
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:23,125
"Ever since, potato-pancakes have
been a no-no in my house"

428
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:27,875
My wife makes nice ones.
Will you have some?

429
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:31,542
"Would you like one?
- No, you’ll be left hungry"

430
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:35,625
"Oh no, have some!
- I hope your wife doesn’t mind?"

431
00:31:36,042 --> 00:31:39,207
"Do you mind, lady?
- Oh no, not at all"

432
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:40,915
See? Bring it up. Quick!

433
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:46,125
"Hurry up, darling! We’re hungry"

434
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:51,166
What’s one going to do...?
One moment. There’s more

435
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:52,583
"Not burnt, not broken..."

436
00:31:52,584 --> 00:31:54,957
steaming hot pancakes!
Here you are!

437
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:57,416
For you and your wife.
- Some chutney...?

438
00:31:57,417 --> 00:32:00,957
"Sure, there is"

439
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:05,041
Take it all away.
We’ll take the bowl later

440
00:32:05,042 --> 00:32:10,208
Yogurt...?
- We don’t have any

441
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:21,917
"Even if it’s in pieces and burnt,
I can eat to my heart’s content"

442
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:27,041
I’ll fix you!

443
00:32:27,042 --> 00:32:30,249
Here you are!
And I went mad looking for you!

444
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:33,333
"In the bank, in the bar...
- You’ll have your money"

445
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:36,665
Let the marriage take place first.
- No marriage!

446
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:40,042
Only destruction!
- Are you already drunk in the day?

447
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,375
"I’ve only drunk, but when he arrives
tomorrow, I’ll be buried!"

448
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:48,875
What rubbish! Who’s arriving?
- Your father Radhesham Tiwari

449
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:53,500
He’s arriving with his wife!
- What am I going to do?

450
00:32:53,917 --> 00:32:57,333
"Go underground. Quit the city.
If possible, quit the world!"

451
00:32:57,334 --> 00:32:59,999
"Right now, go away from here!
- What are you telling me?"

452
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
"That old man can’t do without cows,
buffaloes, fodder and the works"

453
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:07,333
"He’ll stay in the city
for a week, at the most"

454
00:33:07,334 --> 00:33:10,625
So disappear for a week!
- That’s an expensive proposition

455
00:33:11,042 --> 00:33:13,832
"Living in style, I’m already
deep in debt"

456
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:17,917
Pawn the ring garbage gave you and
check into a cheap lodge

457
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:22,416
it’s only for a week!

458
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,500
Isn’t that right?
Of course it’s right!

459
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:31,583
What? You’re going away to London?
For a week?

460
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,124
What’s the hurry?

461
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:38,583
"For business? To make money?
Of course, you must go ahead"

462
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,416
Take care of yourself
in the aircraft

463
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:44,791
"Don’t thrust your arm outside
the window. Yes, I’ll tell Madhuri..."

464
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:50,834
go ahead and make money.
Bye

465
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:56,708
Master is here!
- So this is our Pandu?

466
00:33:57,125 --> 00:34:01,333
"How have you been, Pandu?
- Your blessings, sir"

467
00:34:01,334 --> 00:34:04,333
"Greetings.
- Welcome, sir"

468
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:08,958
"What’s happening here?
- This is our manager, Mr. KC Shukla"

469
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,375
"This is your first visit to our city,
so this is a small welcome"

470
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,124
"You must be tired, sir.
We’ll leave now"

471
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:19,334
What for? I want to get to know
all of you

472
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:24,416
"Please come in, all of you"

473
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:26,999
"Where are you going, Pandu?
Go and fetch the luggage"

474
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,416
For a week or two... how much
luggage must he be carrying?

475
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:33,416
Who told you?
- So?

476
00:34:33,417 --> 00:34:38,958
Sir’s going to live here now.
Forever

477
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:44,415
What happened?
Fetch the luggage

478
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:48,334
"God, nice way you’ve found
of snatching my livelihood"

479
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:56,249
The things he did so
he could sleep on the bed!

480
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:01,125
He now sits quietly!
But at least I can sleep in peace

481
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:06,875
Not a drop of water here

482
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:50,625
"Let me tell you
what I must today..."

483
00:35:51,042 --> 00:35:55,583
let your heart remain with me

484
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:11,416
"Let me tell you
what I must today..."

485
00:36:11,792 --> 00:36:16,375
let my heart remain with me

486
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:51,083
"My eyes are glued
to your face..."

487
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:53,540
"to your face,
I’ve lost my heart"

488
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:56,249
You are the one...

489
00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:02,250
who lives in my heart

490
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:11,749
Pining torments me...

491
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:14,540
I feel scared

492
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:19,667
"Your sweet words might yet
cast a spell on me"

493
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:32,458
"Let me bear
the sweet pain of love..."

494
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:37,667
let your heart remain with me

495
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:53,333
"Let me tell you
what I must today..."

496
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:58,541
let my heart remain with you

497
00:37:58,917 --> 00:38:03,875
Let my heart remain with you

498
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:08,749
Lay off!

499
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:12,917
I’m being forced to live with you!
I know you’re not a decent man...

500
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:16,458
but I thought you had some manners.
You have proved me wrong!

501
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:19,415
Don’t even talk to me again!

502
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:24,375
Don’t ever talk to me!

503
00:38:27,792 --> 00:38:30,917
Stop it! Is that the beat?
Or are you killing flies?

504
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:33,624
Don’t do something you can’t!
- So why are you doing it?

505
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:36,707
Shut up!
- I was following you with the beat

506
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:39,875
Don’t follow me.
Accompany me with the beat

507
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:43,666
"Get it? If tune is the mother,
the rhythm is the father"

508
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:45,999
One who doesn’t get it
is good for nothing

509
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,457
The bell.
- The door’s over there

510
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:55,916
Want me to send you packing?
- I forgot!

511
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:03,749
Whom do you wish to see?

512
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:08,375
The mistress!

513
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:11,290
"Who are you, sister?
- It’s me!"

514
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:14,374
"Who are you, sister?
- Radhesham Tiwari"s..."

515
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:17,959
"Shut up! Who are you, sister?
- I’m Mrs. Anjali Tiwari"

516
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:22,124
I’m glad your name hasn’t changed

517
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:25,917
I’ve made Anjali a member
of the Wild Forest

518
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:31,125
"The forest?
- No, it’s a club. A social club"

519
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:35,250
"Now that we’re here, we must
learn the ways of this city"

520
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:38,666
The women in this city aren’t
lizards on the walls

521
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:42,583
They do a lot of social work.
- What’s surprising is that...

522
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,250
everyone there knew Anjali beforehand.
- Is it?

523
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:50,125
"The moment we stepped in,
everyone shook hands and said..."

524
00:39:52,917 --> 00:39:56,291
That’s when I realized what a huge
business empire we’re running

525
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:00,458
What’s more? He too recognized me
and shook hands with me!

526
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:03,457
Who was the unfortunate man?

527
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:05,749
Shah Rukh.
- Hungry who?

528
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,749
Shah Rukh. The Khan.
Film-star

529
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:12,375
All the film stars come there.
- We must live in style now

530
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:17,083
No style for me.
- Bring a bat into the house...

531
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,667
it’ll still hang from a tree
when it goes to sleep!

532
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:24,458
"Pandu, you get no salary next month.
- It’s a saying, sir!"

533
00:40:24,917 --> 00:40:29,291
"The saying is, bathe as much as the
crow wishes to, it can’t become a swan!"

534
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:32,791
That’s true!
- I’ll bathe and get ready

535
00:40:32,792 --> 00:40:36,375
We’ve got to go to the dance class.
- Dance class? At this age?

536
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:39,791
You’ll sprain your waist!
Let it be

537
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:43,375
it’s an English dance.
Like this!

538
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:46,791
A new way of sweeping the floor?
- See?

539
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:48,958
He starts a fight whenever
I want to do something nice

540
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:52,332
That’s the only difference
between marriage and war

541
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:55,750
"In a marriage, you get to
sleep with the enemy"

542
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:18,791
Anjali darling... mercy!

543
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:22,083
What’s happening here?
- The English dance

544
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,208
"If you jump around at this age and
something happens, I’ll have to pay up"

545
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:30,041
"Nothing’s happening to me.
- I’m talking about the tiles, not you"

546
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:33,875
Quiet! High society women
dance every day...

547
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:37,542
"to keep their bodies fit.
I suggest, you dance too"

548
00:41:37,959 --> 00:41:41,332
Me?
- Yes. Don’t we live in Mumbai?

549
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:44,583
We must learn to live in style.
Look at your managers and officers

550
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,125
They live in such style.
You are their employer...

551
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:50,874
and yet you go around half naked!
Don’t you feel ashamed?

552
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:54,041
I wear what clothes are
necessary to cover my body

553
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,874
And look at your body!
It’s sagging

554
00:41:56,875 --> 00:42:01,333
"Take a walk every morning.
Buy a dog, to throw your weight around"

555
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:04,999
You can take a walk with me then.
- You just won’t take me seriously

556
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,166
I’ve wasted a lot of years in
the village with cattle and fodder

557
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:12,916
I can’t take all that now.
Just watch what Anjali does now

558
00:42:12,917 --> 00:42:17,250
I can see it all! Your obsession
with western culture has begun...

559
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:23,083
I wonder where it will end!

560
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:29,916
"Radhesham Tiwari"s from
your village, isn’t he?"

561
00:42:29,917 --> 00:42:33,916
Who?
- The owner of Anjali Industries?

562
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:38,333
"Oh yes, he’s from my village.
- I’m told he’s in the city nowadays"

563
00:42:39,917 --> 00:42:44,208
Go and meet him. Since you and he
are from the same village...

564
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:47,916
"out of sentiment, he
might give you a job"

565
00:42:47,917 --> 00:42:50,666
Really?
- Give it a try

566
00:42:50,667 --> 00:42:53,666
You and his company
share the same name

567
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:59,500
Maybe that will make him happy
and he’ll give you a job

568
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:07,709
The third time he has
stopped singing!

569
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:10,833
This thing has stalled
for the third time!

570
00:43:10,834 --> 00:43:14,584
The old one was good enough.
But you still bought a new system

571
00:43:14,584 --> 00:43:16,999
You’ve changed too.
So why not the CD-player?

572
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,709
"If you find a new woman,
will you throw me out?"

573
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:25,375
"I’ll do that, if the need arises.
- Just you try"

574
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,249
I’ll show you.
I’m the mother of two children

575
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,666
And people still say
I look like your daughter

576
00:43:30,667 --> 00:43:33,040
Be thankful they don’t think
I’m your grandfather

577
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:36,500
Stop joking and bring a new woman!
It’ll become like your CD player!

578
00:43:36,916 --> 00:43:41,667
It’ll break down!
- What’s the number of this store?

579
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,749
Radhe-Shyam.
- Praise the Lord

580
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:51,915
This is Radhesham Tiwari speaking

581
00:43:51,916 --> 00:43:54,999
You’ve sold me a qawwali
in the name of a Thumri?

582
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
"In just a day, it’s broken down.
Colds, dysentery..."

583
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,915
"You must see a doctor, sir.
This is the Videocon Gallery"

584
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:08,375
I’m talking about the CD-player...
the nuisance you sent to me

585
00:44:09,916 --> 00:44:14,125
No sorry. Pick up this trash
and get going immediately

586
00:44:14,584 --> 00:44:17,040
And send me a new one immediately

587
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:21,375
"No, no, sir. I’ll come
and personally check it"

588
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,583
Who you?
- Anjali...

589
00:44:37,584 --> 00:44:41,584
"Anjali, yes...
what work do you have?"

590
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:47,542
I wish to meet Mr. Radhesham.
- Well? What’s the good news?

591
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:51,082
For a job.
- We have a flourishing business

592
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:54,082
He doesn’t need a job.
- No...

593
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:57,709
I’m the one who wants a job.
Take a look at my certificates

594
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,166
All right. The master’s very
busy right now. Come later

595
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:16,750
Please...
- I told you! Go!

596
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:25,082
I think I must wait a while

597
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:31,209
"If I get to meet Mr. Radhesham,
my work will be done"

598
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:05,291
Must be his daughter

599
00:46:05,292 --> 00:46:08,874
Know where the CD-player is?

600
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:11,082
I’m here to repair it

601
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:14,500
"But I’m not a mechanic.
I own a store, I’ve got to check it"

602
00:46:15,083 --> 00:46:20,291
Must be in there

603
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:31,875
What airs! Spoilt brat!

604
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:35,333
"Hey, roving eyes... over here.
- Jeetendra from Videocon"

605
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:39,458
Over there

606
00:46:39,459 --> 00:46:42,916
The body’s lying here.
Take it away in a bier

607
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:45,832
Take it away.
- I’ll take a look. Two minutes

608
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:49,042
"No need to take a look.
I told you, it’s dead"

609
00:46:49,459 --> 00:46:52,750
"Two minutes, I’ll check.
- No need to check. Don’t touch that"

610
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:56,124
"It must be minor problem, sir.
Let me at least check it!"

611
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:59,375
Pick up the box and get going.
At once!

612
00:47:00,167 --> 00:47:03,500
"Not to worry, sir. I’ll send a
salesman and have it replaced"

613
00:47:17,916 --> 00:47:21,124
"No, I want my money back!"

614
00:47:21,125 --> 00:47:24,167
I don’t want any replacement.
I want my money back!

615
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:28,708
He has left? One can’t trust
these city-guys at all!

616
00:47:30,916 --> 00:47:34,874
Greetings.
- Greetings. You...?

617
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:38,875
I wanted to meet you. But madam
told me that you’re very busy

618
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:42,459
She’s a liar. I’m always free.
What is it?

619
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:47,167
I’ve come here looking for a job.
Here are my certificates

620
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:56,584
Wow! You’ve done M.A. And B.A.

621
00:47:58,916 --> 00:48:01,915
Classical music too! Wow!

622
00:48:01,916 --> 00:48:05,124
"Haven’t you done your SSC?
- Of course, I have"

623
00:48:05,125 --> 00:48:09,874
I was only kidding

624
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:13,833
What sort of a job are you looking for?
- Anything will do

625
00:48:14,334 --> 00:48:17,542
All we need is a security guard

626
00:48:17,958 --> 00:48:21,249
"And there’s no need for an M.A.
Or a B.A. For that, is there?"

627
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:25,917
Let’s clap

628
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:30,333
"Girl, you haven’t left?
- I..."

629
00:48:30,334 --> 00:48:32,207
You keep out of this!
- Sir...

630
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:35,791
He will talk any nonsense.
You get going

631
00:48:36,208 --> 00:48:39,459
"Go away, I say!
- What are you doing?"

632
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,249
Is that the way you
talk to guests?

633
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:47,000
"Have you forgotten your manners?
- I know my manners, mind you"

634
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:50,999
The poor girl...
- Poor girl?

635
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,416
"So give her half your wealth!
- Sure, I will!"

636
00:48:53,417 --> 00:48:57,459
I won’t ask you!
- I know what’s on your mind!

637
00:48:57,875 --> 00:49:02,542
But I’m the Pandey family too.
I brought three cars full of gold

638
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:05,624
Return it to me with interest
and do what you want to!

639
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:10,791
"In any case, I fed your guests and
took the vows to become your wife!"

640
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:16,249
God! This wife sure is a curse!

641
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:21,709
She drove the poor girl away

642
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:38,582
Why did you take the trouble?
I told Mr. Radhesham to phone me...

643
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:43,000
I’d have the CD-player changed.
- But I’ve come here for a job

644
00:49:43,417 --> 00:49:48,833
"You issued an ad, didn’t you?
- Sorry... I don’t understand"

645
00:49:49,334 --> 00:49:52,333
I want this job

646
00:49:52,334 --> 00:49:55,458
The job? What are you talking about?

647
00:49:55,459 --> 00:50:01,375
I need it very badly

648
00:50:02,334 --> 00:50:05,459
Where’s the need for Radhesham
Tiwari"s daughter to take up a job?

649
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:11,291
Looks like there is
a misunderstanding...

650
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:16,000
"I get it. I am an individual,
I have an identity of my own". Right?"

651
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:21,917
That’s a nice thing. I’ve seen girls
with that attitude of late

652
00:50:22,417 --> 00:50:25,582
"Even if their father is a millionaire,
to prove your worth..."

653
00:50:25,583 --> 00:50:29,334
"you’ll work at pizza joints,
cafes and other places"

654
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:35,417
"I’ll give you the job, if you wish.
But what will I be able to pay you?"

655
00:50:37,209 --> 00:50:40,208
What’s 5000 rupees for you?
- 5000?

656
00:50:40,209 --> 00:50:43,291
I know it’s little.
But this business...

657
00:50:43,292 --> 00:50:45,540
Oh my God! I haven’t
even offered you a seat

658
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:50,834
"Come to my office, please"

659
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:55,666
"If you speak the truth, you’ll blow
this last opportunity you’ve got"

660
00:51:00,917 --> 00:51:07,166
I agree to work at 5000 rupees

661
00:51:07,875 --> 00:51:09,665
Your name...?
- Anjali

662
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:13,541
Anjali! So daddy has named
his business after his daughter

663
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:24,958
Jeetu. Call me Jeetu.
- But...

664
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:31,500
"We’re going to be friends, okay?"

665
00:51:36,792 --> 00:51:39,749
"Stop playing with water and
get on with the work, Pandu"

666
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:43,792
"Look, our new puppy.
- Wow!"

667
00:51:44,209 --> 00:51:48,334
"Where are you going with the hippo?
- No hippo, it’s my doggie"

668
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:52,583
And I’m asking the dog where
it’s going with the hippo?

669
00:51:53,334 --> 00:51:56,457
"Shut up! Because I’m your wife,
you can’t talk any nonsense!"

670
00:51:56,458 --> 00:51:59,457
You’re always acting proud
like a peacock

671
00:51:59,458 --> 00:52:03,666
"But don’t forget. When the peacock
loses its feathers, it’s naked!"

672
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:07,958
"Let’s go, puppy.
- You can laugh all you want to"

673
00:52:18,458 --> 00:52:23,249
The things that happen
in this house!

674
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:25,582
You? Here?
- Hasn’t Anil returned?

675
00:52:25,583 --> 00:52:28,499
The lodge... he’ll return
after a week from London

676
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:32,000
You can come after a week.
- Let me meet Mr. Tiwari then

677
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:35,540
We’re going to be relatives soon.
And we have to meet some day

678
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:37,749
He’s not in right now.
- Where has he gone?

679
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:40,208
To the market.
- He? To the market?

680
00:52:40,209 --> 00:52:44,000
The temple! To offer namaz!
- Namaz at the temple?

681
00:52:44,416 --> 00:52:49,708
No... to chant the Lord’s name.
- All right. I’ll wait here

682
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:53,917
"That’s no good. After the prayer,
he’ll take a bath"

683
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:56,707
Won’t be come home for a bath?
- Yes... no!

684
00:52:56,708 --> 00:53:00,750
"He’ll bathe at the temple.
He has sworn it, you see"

685
00:53:01,167 --> 00:53:03,582
"There’s a well at the temple.
- He won’t drown in it, will he?"

686
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:07,208
"He will come home, right?
- Yes, tomorrow!"

687
00:53:07,209 --> 00:53:09,540
I’ll come tomorrow then.
- Sure?

688
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:12,875
Why are you crying?
- Tears of happiness

689
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:16,540
There’s going to be love
between the two of you

690
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:21,750
I’ll come tomorrow

691
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:31,666
Didn’t this garbage bin find
another time to spring here?

692
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:37,000
"Pandu, you’d rather vamoose.
Or you’re going to be dead"

693
00:53:49,959 --> 00:53:52,457
Dead!
- God

694
00:53:52,458 --> 00:53:54,916
Someone from my village
was here to inform me

695
00:53:54,917 --> 00:53:58,959
"Master, can you give me 5000 rupees?
I’ll work and repay it"

696
00:53:59,375 --> 00:54:01,666
Of course.
I’ll give you the money

697
00:54:01,667 --> 00:54:04,083
Take a train and go to
the village immediately

698
00:54:04,084 --> 00:54:06,540
Or you’ll land in trouble

699
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:09,667
Trouble will break out even after
I’ve left for the village

700
00:54:10,416 --> 00:54:15,833
"Lord Ganesh, don’t think I’m flattering
You, but You can very well do it"

701
00:54:18,667 --> 00:54:21,917
That girl Anjali...
make her fall for me

702
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:26,541
"She’s Tiwari"s only daughter. If she
falls for me, it’ll be a huge lottery"

703
00:54:30,375 --> 00:54:34,333
An order from Hotel New Horizon.
They want 50 sets of Videocon TV

704
00:54:34,917 --> 00:54:37,540
it’s 6 p.m.
Let me drop you home

705
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:40,540
No... I’ll take a bus

706
00:54:40,541 --> 00:54:43,124
I’ve got a car.
Why must you take a bus?

707
00:54:43,125 --> 00:54:48,542
C’mon... don’t think too much

708
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,582
What happened?
- Nothing

709
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:13,874
"How can I go away,
until you go inside?"

710
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:19,708
Why not?
- I can see you then

711
00:56:20,792 --> 00:56:24,874
"A coke, please"

712
00:56:24,875 --> 00:56:29,750
"Some chips, please"

713
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:06,750
"Mister, watch the movie ahead.
Not here"

714
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:19,000
I’m not an enemy...

715
00:57:20,458 --> 00:57:24,834
why have you driven me crazy?

716
00:57:34,792 --> 00:57:38,709
I’m a friend...

717
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:44,208
"so why’ve you
stolen my heart?"

718
00:58:09,792 --> 00:58:14,041
"I was out one day,
straying from the path..."

719
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:19,041
"when colorful roses
of love blossomed"

720
00:58:21,792 --> 00:58:26,375
"All distances were finished.
We began to get closer"

721
00:58:26,875 --> 00:58:31,125
"Such was our state,
we began to breathe faster"

722
00:58:38,792 --> 00:58:43,041
"I’m not among
your assassins..."

723
00:58:43,875 --> 00:58:48,125
"so why’ve you thrust me
among those that live?"

724
00:58:58,417 --> 00:59:02,709
I’m a friend...

725
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:07,709
"so why’ve you
stolen my heart?"

726
00:59:32,875 --> 00:59:37,375
"I’ve lost my heart,
although it all began as a joke"

727
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:42,208
"I’ve forgotten the world
to lose myself in your love"

728
00:59:45,417 --> 00:59:49,458
"I wonder how I will
tell you about my love..."

729
00:59:49,916 --> 00:59:54,834
"how will I profess
my love to you?"

730
01:00:01,916 --> 01:00:05,875
I live in your heart...

731
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:11,208
"so why have you given
my heart a sweet pain?"

732
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,500
"I’m the beautiful moonlight
everyone covets..."

733
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:46,250
"God alone knows
who I was born for"

734
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:53,542
"My desire is
a writing on the wall"

735
01:00:53,875 --> 01:00:58,292
"So there will be victory
and defeat in this game of love"

736
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:10,375
I rock in your arms...

737
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:14,916
"yet, why do you accuse me?"

738
01:01:20,584 --> 01:01:24,709
I’m not an enemy...

739
01:01:25,167 --> 01:01:29,333
I’m a friend...

740
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:35,000
"so why’ve you
driven me crazy?"

741
01:01:40,167 --> 01:01:44,667
"Why’ve you
stolen my heart?"

742
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,291
Can’t you sit without
clinging to the girl?

743
01:02:03,292 --> 01:02:06,333
Can’t you sit without
clinging to her?

744
01:02:07,916 --> 01:02:11,040
Is she your sister?
- She’s my wife!

745
01:02:11,041 --> 01:02:13,583
So what are you going to do?
What?

746
01:02:13,584 --> 01:02:17,375
"What wife, son? Your beard says
it all. You weren’t married ever"

747
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,332
You baldie!
Who the hell are you?

748
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:25,333
Who the hell are you to ask me?
- Forget me. Who are you?

749
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:28,040
Who are you?

750
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:31,040
"Whoever you guys are, I’ve bought
a ticket to sleep in peace"

751
01:02:31,041 --> 01:02:34,083
Not to watch the movie!
Go outside and fight!

752
01:02:41,875 --> 01:02:44,124
Where will I get a rampuri?
- I don’t know

753
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:48,041
"Bhelpuri, paani-puri, you get there.
- I’m talking about a knife!"

754
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:51,374
"Where will I get one?
- Don’t do anything rash, boss"

755
01:02:51,375 --> 01:02:54,709
"I’ve decided. If I see him with
Anjali again, I’m going to kill him"

756
01:02:55,208 --> 01:02:58,459
"Either he lives, or I...
- Master, master... he’s her boss"

757
01:02:58,916 --> 01:03:02,167
She has only respect for him.
She’s not in love with him

758
01:03:02,584 --> 01:03:05,709
How do you know?
- I see them everyday in a restaurant

759
01:03:06,208 --> 01:03:10,667
Which restaurant?

760
01:03:18,584 --> 01:03:21,249
He escaped

761
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:25,042
"But if he looks at you again,
he’s going to walk on his hands"

762
01:03:27,125 --> 01:03:30,124
He doesn’t know what
stuff I’m made of

763
01:03:30,125 --> 01:03:32,915
"Forget it. There you go again.
- No, Anjali"

764
01:03:32,916 --> 01:03:36,708
I can’t tolerate anyone teasing you.
I’ll kill him!

765
01:03:38,125 --> 01:03:42,666
Now look... Jeetu...

766
01:03:42,667 --> 01:03:46,042
"Why? What happened?
- Let’s go, please"

767
01:04:01,125 --> 01:04:03,374
What is it?
- What is it?

768
01:04:03,375 --> 01:04:04,874
What’s biting you?
- What’s biting you?

769
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:08,124
"What’s biting you, tell me?
- You tell me what’s biting you"

770
01:04:08,125 --> 01:04:10,207
How did you get here?
- Walking. What’s it to you?

771
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:13,041
Walking? You’ll run away now!
Why’ve you standing between us?

772
01:04:13,042 --> 01:04:16,458
"Why? You own the place?
- Yes, this is my father’s pad. So?"

773
01:04:16,459 --> 01:04:20,042
"It’s my grandfather’s pad, so?
- You got the nerve, eh?"

774
01:04:20,542 --> 01:04:24,708
"You got it? Want me to show?
- All right, you show it"

775
01:04:25,125 --> 01:04:27,458
Try and touch me.
- You try and touch me

776
01:04:27,459 --> 01:04:29,583
Don’t use my lines!
- You don’t use my lines

777
01:04:29,584 --> 01:04:32,708
Go away...
- Want me to show you?

778
01:04:33,208 --> 01:04:36,459
I’ll show it to you.
- Go on... get lost

779
01:04:59,916 --> 01:05:03,458
Want me to show you?
- Let me see!

780
01:05:03,459 --> 01:05:05,583
Coward! You don’t have the spine!

781
01:05:05,584 --> 01:05:08,999
Paper-tigers. They won’t
even touch each other

782
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,082
You don’t know me.
- Who are you?

783
01:05:11,083 --> 01:05:14,125
I’ve seen so many like you!
Go away!

784
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:21,125
Come here and talk to me!
Pipsqueak

785
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:28,667
Here I am! What do you want to say?
- What is it...? What?

786
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:40,042
I’m not scared of you!

787
01:06:52,334 --> 01:06:57,959
I’m going to catch them today!

788
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:31,292
God Almighty!

789
01:07:40,292 --> 01:07:43,457
Why’ve you crying?

790
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:46,374
Why’ve you hollering away?
What’s wrong?

791
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:51,000
You ask me what’s happened?
What a thick-skinned man! Disgusting!

792
01:07:51,458 --> 01:07:55,708
"Despite what you did,
you proudly stand before me!"

793
01:07:56,209 --> 01:07:59,334
Aren’t you ashamed?
- Am I a virgin bride...

794
01:07:59,625 --> 01:08:02,457
to feel shy without reason?
Tell me clearly what has happened

795
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:04,957
So you want to hear it
from my mouth?

796
01:08:04,958 --> 01:08:08,250
Is someone else around?
- Not the values I’ve imbibed...

797
01:08:08,666 --> 01:08:12,042
to utter disgusting things!
I’m from the Pandey family

798
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:13,499
Keep crying!

799
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:16,374
What were you doing with
that girl in the shrubs?

800
01:08:16,375 --> 01:08:19,708
Girl? What girl?
I was looking for my cane.

801
01:08:20,125 --> 01:08:21,499
Without your dhoti?

802
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:25,666
You look so innocent!
Butter wouldn’t melt in your mouth!

803
01:08:26,042 --> 01:08:29,792
"Tell me, who is that girl?
I don’t wear glasses like you!"

804
01:08:30,209 --> 01:08:33,291
Tell me. For how long has this game
of hide n seek been going on?

805
01:08:33,292 --> 01:08:35,540
You drive the girl away
the moment you see me!

806
01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:38,374
How can you even think of
something so filthy?

807
01:08:38,375 --> 01:08:42,334
You can very well do it!
And I can’t even think of it!

808
01:08:42,792 --> 01:08:45,874
I have done nothing!
Even if I have...

809
01:08:45,875 --> 01:08:49,334
it’s a great thing I’ve done!
- You haven’t bought me...

810
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:53,000
to expect me to watch the fun!
- So go away! Right now!

811
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:56,041
"All right, I’ll go away.
But first return to me..."

812
01:08:56,042 --> 01:08:59,708
"the 3 cars full of gold I brought
in dowry, along with interest"

813
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:02,374
I’ll go away after that...
Till then...

814
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:08,625
I won’t let you have a ball!
- Shut up!

815
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:17,540
"What’s up, master? Did the girl
say something nasty to you?"

816
01:09:17,541 --> 01:09:21,000
"One thing is clear, Bholu.
She’s in love with her boss"

817
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:24,707
Not someone crazy like me

818
01:09:24,708 --> 01:09:27,457
I’m glad my craziness
has been of help

819
01:09:27,458 --> 01:09:30,249
How else could I have
made the world see reason?

820
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:33,374
You’re getting disheartened
for no rhyme or reason

821
01:09:33,375 --> 01:09:36,124
"She’s in love with you,
but she won’t tell you"

822
01:09:36,125 --> 01:09:39,667
She wants to make you feel jealous.
- What sort of love is that?

823
01:09:40,084 --> 01:09:42,540
"This game of love, you know"

824
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:46,000
About swimming across oceans
of fire and all that crap

825
01:09:46,458 --> 01:09:48,874
Take my advise.
Fall in love with another girl

826
01:09:48,875 --> 01:09:51,958
Want me to knock your teeth out?
- Don’t jump the gun

827
01:09:52,416 --> 01:09:57,000
Pretend to love someone else.
Like you’re burning in envy...

828
01:09:57,292 --> 01:09:59,791
"she too will burn,
if she really loves you"

829
01:09:59,792 --> 01:10:05,542
She’ll come running to you.
Take it from me in writing

830
01:10:07,959 --> 01:10:12,332
I’ve had it!

831
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,916
"Jeetu, my mother’s here"

832
01:10:14,917 --> 01:10:17,916
"If she sees me here,
all hell will break loose"

833
01:10:17,917 --> 01:10:20,958
I said I was going to a computer class.
- Why?

834
01:10:20,959 --> 01:10:25,209
Because I haven’t told my parents
I’ve taken up a job here

835
01:10:25,667 --> 01:10:29,042
"If she sees me...
- I get it, I get it"

836
01:10:30,583 --> 01:10:33,290
"Stay here, I’ll handle her"

837
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:36,874
Hello... welcome!

838
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:39,666
Wow! You look beautiful!

839
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:42,875
New sari!
New pair of shoes!

840
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:47,707
What can I do for you?
- Give me some music cassettes

841
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:52,874
"Music I can dance to.
- Sure, what do you want?"

842
01:10:52,875 --> 01:10:56,833
"No, I want only Western music!
A childhood habit, you see"

843
01:10:58,667 --> 01:11:01,875
Know what? I’ll make a nice collection
and send it to your house

844
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:06,084
I hope you know my address?
- Who doesn’t?

845
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:11,750
Remember to send it across.
Please don’t forget

846
01:11:17,541 --> 01:11:21,290
Has she left?
- Has she?

847
01:11:21,291 --> 01:11:24,999
Phew! Saved!

848
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,707
"Jeetu, I got to leave early today.
- Why?"

849
01:11:28,708 --> 01:11:32,916
Tomorrow’s my birthday

850
01:11:32,917 --> 01:11:36,207
Aren’t you inviting your
boss to the party?

851
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:39,375
"No, there’s no party. Actually,
I’ve got to out shopping"

852
01:11:39,875 --> 01:11:43,917
"Let’s go. I’ll accompany you.
- No, I’m expecting a friend"

853
01:11:57,667 --> 01:12:00,041
You don’t want to invite me
to your birthday party...

854
01:12:00,042 --> 01:12:04,666
but I’m going to give you
a surprise surely

855
01:12:04,667 --> 01:12:07,707
"Priya, Priya, Priya..."

856
01:12:07,708 --> 01:12:11,874
My dear!

857
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:14,666
"I went crazy about you,
the moment I saw you"

858
01:12:14,667 --> 01:12:19,749
"I know, there are
obstacles in our path"

859
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:23,583
"But rivers and streams
do flow down the mountains"

860
01:12:24,834 --> 01:12:29,249
"Like we have to
unite some day"

861
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:32,124
"You mean the life to me.
I love you more than my life"

862
01:12:32,125 --> 01:12:37,250
You are dearest to my heart

863
01:12:41,042 --> 01:12:47,459
"If she’s jealous, she’s in!
If she’s in, I’ve scored!"

864
01:13:04,667 --> 01:13:09,791
"Did you write this?
- Yes, but..."

865
01:13:09,792 --> 01:13:14,500
Devil!

866
01:13:38,792 --> 01:13:43,791
You?
- I’m here to wish the birthday girl

867
01:13:43,792 --> 01:13:48,000
Fat roses! Who told you
today’s the birthday?

868
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,125
You are a very special customer.
And we maintain records

869
01:13:52,792 --> 01:13:56,291
But there’s a mistake in your records.
- Really?

870
01:13:56,625 --> 01:13:59,791
The birthday’s tomorrow. Not today

871
01:13:59,792 --> 01:14:03,667
But I was told it’s today.
- Who told you?

872
01:14:05,042 --> 01:14:07,999
"That’s what I heard.
- All right, all right"

873
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,333
"Do come again tomorrow,
like you’ve come today"

874
01:14:11,708 --> 01:14:15,375
"You must. The first flowers
have been given by you, you see?"

875
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:28,875
That’s all right

876
01:14:44,792 --> 01:14:48,874
He has brought roses?

877
01:14:48,875 --> 01:14:51,874
And a letter?

878
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:55,375
"My dear Anjali. These roses
are a token of my love"

879
01:14:56,875 --> 01:15:00,000
"Roses arrive today,
to be followed by the bee"

880
01:15:00,458 --> 01:15:06,541
I’m the one he’s
going to sting first

881
01:15:09,792 --> 01:15:13,791
How was it?
- What?

882
01:15:13,792 --> 01:15:17,374
"My bouquet, of course.
- Bouquet?"

883
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:20,582
I gave it in your mummy’s hands.
Didn’t she give it to you?

884
01:15:20,583 --> 01:15:24,250
"I see, that one?
It was very nice"

885
01:15:24,875 --> 01:15:28,207
Did you read the note
I left in the bouquet?

886
01:15:28,208 --> 01:15:31,458
"The note...?
Yes, I did"

887
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:36,208
What did it say?
- Well...

888
01:15:38,875 --> 01:15:43,208
"don’t you know?
- No, I mean..."

889
01:15:43,875 --> 01:15:48,792
"did you like it?
- Yes, of course. Very much"

890
01:15:50,875 --> 01:15:55,125
"So you don’t mind any word
I’ve written, do you?"

891
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,124
Mind? Why would I mind?

892
01:15:59,125 --> 01:16:01,833
So why did you lie to me?
- Lie?

893
01:16:01,834 --> 01:16:05,542
"That yesterday was your birthday?
- Actually, Jeetu..."

894
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:08,874
You didn’t want to invite me
to the party

895
01:16:08,875 --> 01:16:12,166
That’s not true.
There was no party at all

896
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:16,709
"I know, because the party’s
tomorrow and so is your birthday"

897
01:16:17,208 --> 01:16:20,374
Your mummy has invited me

898
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:25,584
"So you’re coming tomorrow?
- I won’t, if you don’t want me to"

899
01:16:25,875 --> 01:16:29,958
You must! Why mustn’t you?
At what time did she say?

900
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,915
"At 7, she said.
- I see"

901
01:16:32,916 --> 01:16:36,332
Know what? Come at 9.
- Why?

902
01:16:36,333 --> 01:16:40,041
The time has changed a bit

903
01:16:44,375 --> 01:16:50,042
I’ll be there at 9.
- All right

904
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:17,167
"If Jeetu had arrived before the cake
was cut, I’d have been exposed"

905
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,500
Why’ve you standing outside?
- Actually...

906
01:17:31,916 --> 01:17:35,291
I’m waiting for some friends of mine.
They don’t have the proper address

907
01:17:35,292 --> 01:17:37,999
Know what? Go in there
and enjoy the party

908
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,040
I’ll join you as soon
as my friends arrive

909
01:17:42,041 --> 01:17:47,958
Of course! I’ll join you
in a few minutes

910
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:00,915
He’s the same boy!

911
01:18:00,916 --> 01:18:03,874
Dad! I’ve had it!

912
01:18:03,875 --> 01:18:07,332
He’s hiding from me!
So I was right

913
01:18:07,333 --> 01:18:13,333
"This boy’s having an affair
with Anjali, I’m sure"

914
01:18:32,083 --> 01:18:34,999
You’ve got your peace...

915
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,500
"all I’ve got
is my craziness"

916
01:18:40,667 --> 01:18:44,040
You’ve come to your senses...

917
01:18:44,041 --> 01:18:49,332
and I’m still in a daze

918
01:18:49,333 --> 01:18:53,000
"But you’re the one
my heart still loves"

919
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:56,499
You’ve got your peace...

920
01:18:56,500 --> 01:19:01,999
"all I’ve got
is my craziness"

921
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,999
You’ve come to your senses...

922
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:10,666
and I’m still in a daze

923
01:19:10,667 --> 01:19:14,292
"But you’re the one
my heart still loves"

924
01:19:58,125 --> 01:20:02,042
How am I going to placate it?

925
01:20:02,542 --> 01:20:05,708
"My heart is crazy,
it won’t relent"

926
01:20:06,584 --> 01:20:10,667
How will I tell my heart...?

927
01:20:11,208 --> 01:20:14,375
"It does not know
what love is all about"

928
01:20:15,125 --> 01:20:22,459
"I’m obsessed with you...
and you don’t even realize it"

929
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:29,459
"You got all the hospitality,
I was treated with indifference"

930
01:20:32,208 --> 01:20:37,791
"You’ve got back to your senses,
I’m still in a daze"

931
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:44,459
"You’re the one
my heart loves"

932
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:23,750
"Here’s someone who could
die for her love..."

933
01:21:24,083 --> 01:21:27,500
"and there’s someone who’s
unfaithful in love"

934
01:21:28,292 --> 01:21:36,208
"What pain these distances give...
only in separation will we know"

935
01:21:36,666 --> 01:21:43,584
"Ever since I have seen you,
I’ve gone crazy"

936
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:48,374
You’ve got your sleep...

937
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:53,416
I got only helplessness

938
01:21:53,417 --> 01:21:56,542
You’ve come to your senses...

939
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:02,207
and I’m still in a daze

940
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:06,125
"But you’re the one
my heart still loves"

941
01:22:06,666 --> 01:22:09,832
You’ve got your peace...

942
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:14,665
"all I’ve got
is my craziness"

943
01:22:14,666 --> 01:22:17,791
You’ve come to your senses...

944
01:22:18,125 --> 01:22:21,583
and I’m still in a daze

945
01:22:37,334 --> 01:22:41,124
You dare call that boy
to the party?

946
01:22:41,125 --> 01:22:45,417
You invited that witch too.
- Which one?

947
01:22:45,791 --> 01:22:48,958
The one your eyes were glued to
at the party!

948
01:22:49,334 --> 01:22:53,583
Wow! That’s a wolf
in sheep’s clothing!

949
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,042
I can understand it from the way
your feet were moving and...

950
01:22:58,459 --> 01:23:01,750
the way your anklets were chiming.
Now that you’re exposed...

951
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,708
you accuse me and find the excuse of
having fun with that young boy?

952
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:08,499
The pot calling the kettle black!

953
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:13,250
"I caught you in the shrubs,
so you cast mud at me..."

954
01:23:13,625 --> 01:23:16,875
and try to save yourself?
Listen carefully!

955
01:23:17,334 --> 01:23:20,582
I’m not letting your scheme work!
I’ve had enough of your farce!

956
01:23:20,583 --> 01:23:24,875
You take me for a fool?
You think I’m an idiot?

957
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:28,333
Just let me tell you!
I know how it is!

958
01:23:28,334 --> 01:23:31,333
It’s not going to work for long!
- All right

959
01:23:31,334 --> 01:23:35,917
Give me the gold I brought with
interest. I’ll go back!

960
01:23:36,334 --> 01:23:41,833
Go back! How about the expensive saris
I’ve given your horrible body?

961
01:23:42,375 --> 01:23:47,125
Who’s paying for the goodies you
helped yourself to over the years?

962
01:23:47,459 --> 01:23:51,708
I cooked for you all day and night!
My work pays for it all!

963
01:23:53,209 --> 01:23:56,334
You paint the town red with strangers
and talk back at me!

964
01:23:56,792 --> 01:24:00,334
"The scores are leveled!
If you can do it, so can I!"

965
01:24:00,666 --> 01:24:03,374
"Will you do it...? Will you?
- Yes, I will too!"

966
01:24:03,375 --> 01:24:05,791
So will I!
- Go ahead and do it!

967
01:24:05,792 --> 01:24:08,958
Who’s stopping you? Just stop
interfering in my affairs!

968
01:24:09,334 --> 01:24:15,166
You mustn’t interfere either!
- I won’t!

969
01:24:27,209 --> 01:24:30,208
Hello.
- Hello

970
01:24:30,209 --> 01:24:36,667
I’m Teja-bhai.
- Please come in

971
01:24:37,209 --> 01:24:40,833
I haven’t recognized you.
- I’m your son’s father-in-law

972
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:48,833
I don’t get it.
- I won’t beat around the bush...

973
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:52,666
and confuse you.
I’ll come the point

974
01:24:53,334 --> 01:24:56,750
Don’t let your B.P. Get out of hand
when you listen to it

975
01:24:57,084 --> 01:25:00,917
That’s what I say.
Come straight to the point

976
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:05,500
My daughter has decided
to marry your son

977
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,333
What?

978
01:25:08,334 --> 01:25:11,208
Hello

979
01:25:11,209 --> 01:25:19,167
One moment. Your daughter has
decided to marry my son

980
01:25:19,875 --> 01:25:21,791
Right?
- Right

981
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:27,209
So what can I do? Tell your daughter
to change her mind

982
01:25:27,666 --> 01:25:30,291
"No, you don’t understand"

983
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:33,541
The two of them have got together
and taken this decision

984
01:25:33,958 --> 01:25:37,374
They’ve got engaged.
They’ve even exchanged rings

985
01:25:37,375 --> 01:25:41,875
What is he talking about?
- It can’t be our son

986
01:25:42,292 --> 01:25:44,707
Because our son is not here.
- I know

987
01:25:44,708 --> 01:25:47,083
Your son is in London.
- Right

988
01:25:47,084 --> 01:25:49,540
But your son was here.
- When did he go back?

989
01:25:49,541 --> 01:25:53,209
"After the engagement, he went away.
On business"

990
01:25:55,625 --> 01:25:59,541
I’ve sent my son to London for
further studies. Not business

991
01:26:00,042 --> 01:26:03,167
"Now look, mister.
What’s happened is in the past"

992
01:26:03,708 --> 01:26:07,167
Let’s peacefully and amicably
sort it out

993
01:26:07,708 --> 01:26:12,209
"It can’t be sorted out, Teja-bhai.
My son will marry the girl I want him to"

994
01:26:12,583 --> 01:26:16,625
"You mean, whatever has happened...
- What has happened?"

995
01:26:17,292 --> 01:26:20,291
"They’ve just exchanged rings, right?
They haven’t got married yet"

996
01:26:20,292 --> 01:26:23,291
He’ll throw the ring away.
End of the story

997
01:26:23,292 --> 01:26:25,540
How will he take off the ring?

998
01:26:25,541 --> 01:26:29,833
My daughter isn’t an empty bottle
whose label he can change at will

999
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:33,209
Don’t talk too much!
From the look of you...

1000
01:26:33,541 --> 01:26:36,374
I can tell how your daughter must be.
- Does she also sport a moustache?

1001
01:26:36,375 --> 01:26:41,250
"Radhesham Tiwari! If you’re
a big man, I don’t care!"

1002
01:26:41,792 --> 01:26:45,667
You don’t know Teja!
I come from a family of killers

1003
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:50,500
There wasn’t a day when my father’s
knife did not taste blood!

1004
01:26:51,291 --> 01:26:54,792
His father was a butcher?
- You are insulting me!

1005
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:58,290
"You’re still here?
Shameless man, go away"

1006
01:26:58,291 --> 01:27:02,374
I’ll go away!
But I will surely come back!

1007
01:27:02,375 --> 01:27:04,332
Listen...
- What?

1008
01:27:04,333 --> 01:27:06,666
"I’m talking to her, not you"

1009
01:27:06,667 --> 01:27:10,541
"I suggest we call our son down here.
- Yes, call him here"

1010
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:14,457
And see whether he obeys to you or me.
- Won’t you go away?

1011
01:27:14,458 --> 01:27:17,875
I’m leaving. Don’t yell as if
you’re fighting the elections!

1012
01:27:23,959 --> 01:27:27,083
Could there be some truth
in the rubbish he just spoke?

1013
01:27:27,084 --> 01:27:29,374
Not at all. He’s just a fool

1014
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:32,374
Do you really think so?
- No

1015
01:27:32,375 --> 01:27:38,375
Know what? We’ll telephone him
and call him over

1016
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:43,832
I’ve got to know the truth.
- What?

1017
01:27:43,833 --> 01:27:47,415
That Anjali and you are
not man and wife

1018
01:27:47,416 --> 01:27:51,000
Meaning?
- I’ve heard the bickering...

1019
01:27:51,416 --> 01:27:55,375
that goes on between the two of you.
How would you know how happy I am...

1020
01:27:56,084 --> 01:27:59,415
to learn the truth?
- We do keep fighting...

1021
01:27:59,416 --> 01:28:02,959
but we are really man and wife.
- I know everything. Look at this

1022
01:28:03,375 --> 01:28:07,708
"Miss Anjali Does anyone address
a married woman as "Miss"?"

1023
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:11,959
"Ever since you wrote that
letter to me, I understood..."

1024
01:28:12,458 --> 01:28:16,708
you would really marry me.
You will free me from Popat"s cage!

1025
01:28:17,208 --> 01:28:19,791
Marry you?

1026
01:28:19,792 --> 01:28:23,042
What if Popat gets to know?
- To hell with the old fossil!

1027
01:28:23,416 --> 01:28:24,874
Anjali"s coming

1028
01:28:24,875 --> 01:28:28,959
You’re the one I was waiting for.
There’s a letter for you

1029
01:28:29,375 --> 01:28:35,833
"I thought I’d give it to you.
- Okay, I get it"

1030
01:28:43,708 --> 01:28:46,959
So this is the extent he has gone to!
But why must I care?

1031
01:28:47,542 --> 01:28:49,582
Mother has written to me
from the village

1032
01:28:49,583 --> 01:28:52,833
The landlord’s son will arrive.
He’ll marry me and take me away

1033
01:28:52,834 --> 01:28:54,958
We’ll live in marital bliss

1034
01:28:54,959 --> 01:28:58,084
"My dear Anjali, I’m sending Raja
to you by tomorrow’s train"

1035
01:28:58,542 --> 01:29:02,500
"You’ll get to know each other better,
if he stays with you for a few days"

1036
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,833
"He’s the one
you’re going to marry anyway"

1037
01:29:05,834 --> 01:29:09,750
"Don’t forget, we’re alive today
because his family has helped us"

1038
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:14,084
"You will never disobey your mother.
You will agree to the wedding"

1039
01:29:14,583 --> 01:29:18,834
"I’m sending you a photograph of Raja.
He’s no longer like he was..."

1040
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:22,333
"he has changed a lot. He has shaved
his beard, he now looks like a prince"

1041
01:29:22,875 --> 01:29:27,499
You’ll be stunned

1042
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:34,000
"My prince will come to marry me
and I’ll dance in joy"

1043
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:39,041
Another villain...?

1044
01:29:39,042 --> 01:29:41,666
Who the hell is he?
- Whoever

1045
01:29:41,667 --> 01:29:45,083
He’ll marry Anjali and even
drive me out of the house

1046
01:29:45,084 --> 01:29:47,290
I have an idea.
- What?

1047
01:29:47,291 --> 01:29:50,332
Let’s scare him and
force him to return

1048
01:29:50,333 --> 01:29:54,750
How?

1049
01:30:04,208 --> 01:30:06,833
He’s the one.
- So go and scare him!

1050
01:30:06,834 --> 01:30:09,541
"No, not here. It’s a crowded place"

1051
01:30:09,542 --> 01:30:14,500
"Once I scare him, he won’t
step in Mumbai again. Come on"

1052
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:38,499
What’s he up to...?
Has he gone mad?

1053
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:44,374
"He’s cleaning something.
The shoe or the pole, I can’t say"

1054
01:30:44,375 --> 01:30:47,542
He’s stuck to it!
- He must be electrocuted!

1055
01:30:47,959 --> 01:30:50,624
Go and save him!
- Are you crazy? You’ll die too

1056
01:30:50,625 --> 01:30:56,666
"Find a stick.
One blow, and he’ll be separated"

1057
01:31:06,542 --> 01:31:08,958
Is that why they tried to kill me?

1058
01:31:08,959 --> 01:31:12,208
"Yes. I brought you here,
because I liked you"

1059
01:31:12,625 --> 01:31:15,541
Anjali isn’t as innocent
as you think

1060
01:31:15,542 --> 01:31:18,541
She’s having a terrific
scene with someone

1061
01:31:18,542 --> 01:31:21,750
Who?
- The one who...

1062
01:31:23,959 --> 01:31:27,875
He’s a very dangerous man.
Have you heard of Chhota Chetan?

1063
01:31:28,375 --> 01:31:31,457
I saw the movie. In 3-D.
- Not that

1064
01:31:31,458 --> 01:31:34,916
He’s from the underworld.
Even the cops are terrified of him

1065
01:31:34,917 --> 01:31:38,375
"He has committed 40 murders,
but he still hasn’t been caught"

1066
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:43,250
He uses a new knife for every killing.
I saw him with a new one yesterday

1067
01:31:43,709 --> 01:31:48,417
Maybe it’s meant for you.
- So why did Anjali"s Ma send me here?

1068
01:31:48,959 --> 01:31:52,041
They plan to bring you to the city
to bump you off

1069
01:31:52,709 --> 01:31:56,291
Even if Anjali marries Chhota
Chetan after your death...

1070
01:31:56,709 --> 01:32:01,208
"her family has nothing to lose.
- No, that can’t be true"

1071
01:32:01,625 --> 01:32:04,916
"Whether you believe it or not,
your body will believe me"

1072
01:32:04,917 --> 01:32:08,542
Is Raja here?
- Go to sleep Raja!

1073
01:32:11,875 --> 01:32:15,708
Is there anyone here
answering to the name Raja?

1074
01:32:15,709 --> 01:32:19,958
I’m going to finish him!
He’s hiding somewhere around

1075
01:32:20,375 --> 01:32:23,374
My men have just broken
a few of his limbs

1076
01:32:23,375 --> 01:32:28,333
He’s my 50th victim. I’m having
a grand party after killing him

1077
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:32,625
I’ll finish him if he comes here.
Tell him I was here

1078
01:32:36,875 --> 01:32:40,041
Did you see...?
- How would I? You covered my face!

1079
01:32:40,041 --> 01:32:44,333
"Why did you lie? You say he has
committed 40 murders, he says 50!"

1080
01:32:44,750 --> 01:32:48,041
"Whatever! He has committed
the murders, not me"

1081
01:32:48,875 --> 01:32:51,749
Now get the hell out of here.
- How far is the railway station?

1082
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:55,333
I’ve got catch a train back home.
- No point in venturing out

1083
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:58,874
There’s a strike in the railways.
Can’t say when it’ll end

1084
01:32:58,875 --> 01:33:02,040
So what am I to do?
- Hide somewhere here

1085
01:33:02,041 --> 01:33:05,292
Chhota Chetan and his men will
look for you all over Mumbai

1086
01:33:05,709 --> 01:33:08,958
So hide under an assumed name.
- But where will I hide?

1087
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:12,625
Find a cheap lodge near the railway
station. Hole up in one of them

1088
01:33:13,041 --> 01:33:16,333
Catch the first train out
as soon as the strike is over

1089
01:33:16,667 --> 01:33:19,666
"Else, I’ll have to mail
your body to your village"

1090
01:33:19,667 --> 01:33:23,375
"Believe me, or go to hell"

1091
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:34,207
"Welcome! Welcome, Teja-bhai"

1092
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:40,666
Hey sonny... come here.
Let me show you something

1093
01:33:41,083 --> 01:33:43,708
This is my son.
- This...?

1094
01:33:43,709 --> 01:33:45,915
Recognize him?
- No

1095
01:33:45,916 --> 01:33:49,208
No? And he says he’s
your father-in-law!

1096
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:52,082
Ask him!

1097
01:33:52,083 --> 01:33:54,957
Have I married your daughter?
- No

1098
01:33:54,958 --> 01:33:57,374
Have I promised to marry her?
- No

1099
01:33:57,375 --> 01:34:00,500
Tell me something...
are you weak in the head?

1100
01:34:00,958 --> 01:34:03,165
No.
- So why did you kick up a fuss...

1101
01:34:03,166 --> 01:34:06,208
that he had promised to marry her?
Why did you create a scene?

1102
01:34:06,542 --> 01:34:09,749
Is he your son?

1103
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:11,749
Any doubts?
- No

1104
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:14,124
I have no doubt
that he’s my son

1105
01:34:14,125 --> 01:34:18,542
He’s not the one I spoke about.
It’s your other son

1106
01:34:19,125 --> 01:34:22,667
What’s all that about...?
Which other son?

1107
01:34:23,208 --> 01:34:25,708
Your elder son!
- Look at him

1108
01:34:25,709 --> 01:34:28,040
I have another son and
I don’t even know about it!

1109
01:34:28,041 --> 01:34:31,040
You have a brother too!
- You are a big man...

1110
01:34:31,041 --> 01:34:33,832
who runs a big business empire.
You must have forgotten

1111
01:34:33,833 --> 01:34:37,124
But your other son lives right here.
Everyone knows that

1112
01:34:37,125 --> 01:34:40,167
My God! What am I hearing...?

1113
01:34:40,833 --> 01:34:44,124
You have another son
outside my knowledge?

1114
01:34:44,125 --> 01:34:47,207
"This man is lying!
- He’s your son, all right"

1115
01:34:47,208 --> 01:34:50,291
Though he’s a bit dark of skin

1116
01:34:50,292 --> 01:34:53,417
"When I saw her, I was a bit doubtful"

1117
01:34:53,916 --> 01:34:57,207
But anyone who looks at you
will say he’s your son

1118
01:34:57,208 --> 01:35:00,291
"The same eyes, the same nose,
The same lips..."

1119
01:35:00,292 --> 01:35:03,166
This is rubbish!

1120
01:35:03,167 --> 01:35:05,166
Don’t scream!

1121
01:35:05,167 --> 01:35:09,208
"Call your servant, Pandu.
He knows everything"

1122
01:35:09,625 --> 01:35:11,749
He was witness to everything.
Where is Pandu?

1123
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:13,874
"He’s gone to the village,
his father has died"

1124
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:15,749
"Died, or did you have him killed?"

1125
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:18,416
You send him away when you’re
about to be exposed?

1126
01:35:18,417 --> 01:35:21,750
I understand it all! It’s your ploy
to stall the marriage!

1127
01:35:22,125 --> 01:35:25,750
Enough! Make anymore noise and
I’ll sue you for defamation!

1128
01:35:26,041 --> 01:35:29,207
"Shut up! You aren’t Tiwari,
you’re a disease!"

1129
01:35:29,208 --> 01:35:34,125
I’ve cured diseases like you!
I visit the courts every day

1130
01:35:34,667 --> 01:35:37,874
"Don’t forget, I come from
a family of killers"

1131
01:35:37,875 --> 01:35:40,040
"Are you threatening me? Are you?
- Yes, I’m threatening you!"

1132
01:35:40,041 --> 01:35:43,167
So go and do what you can!
- You’ll know it very soon!

1133
01:35:43,709 --> 01:35:47,625
"In a week’s time, if you don’t
let the marriage take place..."

1134
01:35:47,875 --> 01:35:53,000
you’ll know!

1135
01:35:53,041 --> 01:35:55,874
My God! I’m doomed!

1136
01:35:55,875 --> 01:36:01,875
Mom! What are you doing?

1137
01:36:02,208 --> 01:36:08,166
Am I supposed to stay here
or go back to London?

1138
01:36:08,167 --> 01:36:12,417
"My son, at what time is your flight?
- At eleven tonight, Mom"

1139
01:36:13,167 --> 01:36:16,833
Go away! If you stay here...

1140
01:36:17,208 --> 01:36:23,667
you’re going to get spoilt
in your father’s shadow!

1141
01:36:24,875 --> 01:36:28,500
"Dad, I’m leaving. I’ll confirm
my ticket at the airport"

1142
01:36:28,958 --> 01:36:34,583
All right. God bless you

1143
01:36:34,916 --> 01:36:38,041
Let’s get out of here.
There’s no meaning in staying here

1144
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:41,500
Let’s pack our bags and get going!
- Only after coming here...

1145
01:36:41,958 --> 01:36:46,542
I’ve got to see your true colors!
- What rubbish are you talking?

1146
01:36:47,042 --> 01:36:50,374
You don’t believe me
and you believe a stranger?

1147
01:36:50,375 --> 01:36:53,374
I wouldn’t have believed it earlier

1148
01:36:53,375 --> 01:36:56,667
But there’s no way
I cannot believe it now

1149
01:36:57,208 --> 01:37:03,250
"You are a flirt! Before our marriage,
you have been a womanizer!"

1150
01:37:03,875 --> 01:37:06,082
I’ll go back only when
I have all the proof!

1151
01:37:06,083 --> 01:37:09,459
I’ll shave my moustache
if you leave this city!

1152
01:37:09,958 --> 01:37:12,957
Your heart won’t relent
unless you see him!

1153
01:37:12,958 --> 01:37:15,999
"That bloody Videocon!
- My virtuous husband, aren’t you?"

1154
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,291
You keep listening to
classical music all day...

1155
01:37:19,292 --> 01:37:22,875
and this is what you do by night?
You are Satan himself!

1156
01:37:23,334 --> 01:37:28,875
Wow! You accuse me...?
I’ve seen your programmes already!

1157
01:37:29,292 --> 01:37:34,542
"A good thing, isn’t it?
Keep watching it... and kill me!"

1158
01:37:34,875 --> 01:37:38,374
God!

1159
01:37:38,375 --> 01:37:42,875
She won’t die like that...
go to her help!

1160
01:37:57,125 --> 01:38:03,458
"Manager, do you have a room?"

1161
01:38:04,958 --> 01:38:08,208
"Whatever it is, I shouldn’t
have to leave the room"

1162
01:38:08,708 --> 01:38:14,834
And I want an attached toilet

1163
01:38:18,042 --> 01:38:23,042
Name...? Raja...

1164
01:38:23,125 --> 01:38:25,374
Tulsidas Khan

1165
01:38:25,375 --> 01:38:28,958
"What name is Tulsidas Khan?
- Shut up, scoundrel"

1166
01:38:29,459 --> 01:38:32,082
Your father’s name?
- Javed Chaurasia

1167
01:38:32,083 --> 01:38:34,749
Your mother’s name?
- Mumtaz Bedi

1168
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:38,041
Are you the India-Pakistan border...?
Were you born to cross parents?

1169
01:38:38,042 --> 01:38:41,167
"Shut up, or I’ll slap you!
- Is your old man dead?"

1170
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:46,041
"Of course, I’ll pay you"

1171
01:38:46,042 --> 01:38:50,500
"And give me the keys, quick.
I badly want to pee"

1172
01:38:50,833 --> 01:38:54,208
And don’t tell anyone
that I’m staying here

1173
01:38:55,167 --> 01:38:57,499
Pay for the cups you broke.
- Get lost

1174
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:01,375
Pay for the two cups you broke.
- I won’t! Get lost!

1175
01:39:03,042 --> 01:39:06,082
Give that to me

1176
01:39:06,083 --> 01:39:09,707
My umbrella!

1177
01:39:09,708 --> 01:39:12,041
I’ll carry it for you.
- Not necessary

1178
01:39:12,042 --> 01:39:18,250
The name is Babu Bisleri.
- I don’t want to bathe!

1179
01:39:21,708 --> 01:39:26,167
"I can’t trust anyone. Everyone
appears to be Chhota Chetan"s man"

1180
01:39:27,083 --> 01:39:32,167
"They’re out to kill me!
Anjali, why did you do this to me?"

1181
01:39:33,042 --> 01:39:36,499
Why?

1182
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:39,749
"Priya, what am I going to do
about Jeetu"

1183
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:42,041
"If I tell him the truth,
I’ll lose my job"

1184
01:39:42,042 --> 01:39:45,041
There’s a vacancy in my office
for a receptionist

1185
01:39:45,042 --> 01:39:50,459
Your qualifications are the best among
the lot. I’m sure you’ll get it

1186
01:39:51,125 --> 01:39:55,125
But you’ll have to wait for a month.
- A month?

1187
01:39:55,833 --> 01:39:58,166
What will I do with Jeetu
in a month?

1188
01:39:58,167 --> 01:40:02,042
Don’t go to work at all.
- What if he visits Radhesham"s house?

1189
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:06,750
"He’ll get to know the truth.
Which he has to, some day"

1190
01:40:07,209 --> 01:40:09,874
Ring him up and ask him
for leave of a month

1191
01:40:09,875 --> 01:40:11,957
Tell him that your Papa"s suspicious

1192
01:40:11,958 --> 01:40:14,540
That he sends the driver
with you everywhere

1193
01:40:14,541 --> 01:40:17,750
"When you finally land the job,
you can tell him the truth"

1194
01:40:27,583 --> 01:40:29,416
"Sir, I’ve checked it thoroughly.
It’s first-class"

1195
01:40:29,417 --> 01:40:33,167
Since you sent me the new system
did I ever call you to tell you...

1196
01:40:33,541 --> 01:40:36,208
that I wanted you to come here
and solve a problem?

1197
01:40:36,209 --> 01:40:38,041
"No, sir. You didn’t.
- No?"

1198
01:40:38,042 --> 01:40:43,166
So did you dream it had a problem?

1199
01:40:43,167 --> 01:40:46,875
"No? So why have you come here?
- Service check, to see if it’s okay"

1200
01:40:47,209 --> 01:40:50,625
I know there’s no problem with it.
- No problem

1201
01:40:54,209 --> 01:40:57,540
What are you looking around for?

1202
01:40:57,541 --> 01:40:59,416
"Sir, isn’t Anjali there?"

1203
01:40:59,417 --> 01:41:05,666
So this is how it is! He calls a woman
of his mother’s age by her name!

1204
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:10,708
"You do get along well, don’t you?
- We know each other very well, sir"

1205
01:41:11,083 --> 01:41:14,208
"You must’ve met at your shop, right?
- No, sir..."

1206
01:41:14,209 --> 01:41:18,500
we’ve met mostly outside.
- Romeo and Juliet meeting outside!

1207
01:41:18,875 --> 01:41:22,707
No wonder she goes out
all dressed up!

1208
01:41:22,708 --> 01:41:24,499
Anjali"s not in

1209
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:27,457
Have you checked everything?
- Yes

1210
01:41:27,458 --> 01:41:29,166
Is all the payment made?
- Yes

1211
01:41:29,167 --> 01:41:31,166
Nothing outstanding?
- Not at all

1212
01:41:31,167 --> 01:41:34,457
So what are you looking around for?
- That painting...

1213
01:41:34,458 --> 01:41:37,958
"it’s lovely. Must be very expensive?
- I don’t know, I stole it"

1214
01:41:41,458 --> 01:41:46,291
There’s the door

1215
01:41:46,292 --> 01:41:48,707
Can I have a glass of water?
- No water supply for three days

1216
01:41:48,708 --> 01:41:51,833
I’ve been drinking only coffee. But
there’s just a cup left. Anything else?

1217
01:42:00,292 --> 01:42:02,874
I’ll come in a couple of days to
check whether there’s a problem

1218
01:42:02,875 --> 01:42:06,583
"No, you have given us enough trouble.
Don’t give us anymore trouble..."

1219
01:42:06,917 --> 01:42:10,624
we’ll bear the trouble
we already have

1220
01:42:10,625 --> 01:42:15,291
"If I could meet her mother,
maybe I could meet Anjali too"

1221
01:42:15,292 --> 01:42:17,916
"Is the wife there, sir?"

1222
01:42:17,917 --> 01:42:20,291
"My wife! Not "the wife!"

1223
01:42:20,292 --> 01:42:22,707
It’s not a joint-account!
She’s all mine

1224
01:42:22,708 --> 01:42:26,541
What I meant was...
- I know what you meant

1225
01:42:26,958 --> 01:42:30,291
She’s not in right now.
Tell me what it is regarding

1226
01:42:30,292 --> 01:42:32,665
"Will you tell her I was here,
asking for her?"

1227
01:42:32,666 --> 01:42:34,665
Must I?
- Please don’t forget

1228
01:42:34,666 --> 01:42:40,958
Oh no! I can’t forget this
till I die!

1229
01:43:44,375 --> 01:43:48,291
Sister! She’s regaining consciousness.
Please call her husband

1230
01:43:52,291 --> 01:43:56,333
There’s no need to worry. You got
injuries in the feet and head...

1231
01:43:56,708 --> 01:43:59,749
because of which you’ve been
unconscious all day

1232
01:43:59,750 --> 01:44:03,625
But the doctor has examined you.
Everything is all right

1233
01:44:04,416 --> 01:44:08,625
How will I thank you?
- Why thank me? I just got here

1234
01:44:09,084 --> 01:44:12,291
Thank your husband who’s been here
all night and day

1235
01:44:12,708 --> 01:44:16,625
"He didn’t budge from here. He cried
so much, he’s in a bad way"

1236
01:44:17,375 --> 01:44:21,875
"You’ll be discharged in a day or two.
Look after yourself, okay?"

1237
01:44:22,375 --> 01:44:27,833
I must leave now

1238
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:50,875
it’s all my mistake.
Please forgive me

1239
01:45:00,667 --> 01:45:06,375
Who’s that boy who has tainted
a virtuous woman like your wife?

1240
01:45:06,875 --> 01:45:11,792
You! You fed her all the crap and
compelled her to come to the city!

1241
01:45:12,542 --> 01:45:15,832
I didn’t want to set foot
in this city!

1242
01:45:15,833 --> 01:45:18,624
I know the water in this city
is contaminated...

1243
01:45:18,625 --> 01:45:22,333
and the people here are scoundrels!
- Sir...

1244
01:45:23,416 --> 01:45:27,000
Anandilal Kitpitia...
- I’m sick of you and your...

1245
01:45:27,542 --> 01:45:32,541
coming! Stop ringing!

1246
01:45:32,542 --> 01:45:35,666
This is Jeetu from Videocon.
Is Anjali there?

1247
01:45:35,667 --> 01:45:40,042
Anjali has drowned in the sea!
- Please give her the phone...

1248
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:44,000
Are you trying to bully me?
You wretched guitar!

1249
01:45:44,375 --> 01:45:47,416
I’m not giving the phone to Anjali!
I’m not! What will you do?

1250
01:45:49,583 --> 01:45:53,416
Bull’s offspring!
Whom are you threatening?

1251
01:45:53,959 --> 01:45:57,084
I know scum like you!

1252
01:45:57,542 --> 01:46:00,499
Your father must’ve been
up to no good to sire you

1253
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:02,791
If you even utter the name
of the Tiwari family...

1254
01:46:02,792 --> 01:46:06,042
I’m going to break the legs of
everyone in your family!

1255
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:20,499
He appears to be a dangerous man

1256
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:25,916
Well...

1257
01:46:27,542 --> 01:46:33,875
Looks like only a beating will...
- What beating at this age?

1258
01:46:34,542 --> 01:46:38,416
It was different earlier. I used to
fell a couple of them in the ring

1259
01:46:38,875 --> 01:46:42,374
"I’m talking about thugs, sir.
Not you"

1260
01:46:42,375 --> 01:46:47,500
I’ve fought a lot of such criminal
cases! I know a few thugs too

1261
01:46:48,208 --> 01:46:52,834
You’ve only got to pay them and show
them what this chap looks like

1262
01:46:54,834 --> 01:46:59,500
Don’t hit him too much.
Just give him a push and let him go

1263
01:46:59,875 --> 01:47:03,083
"If he acts smart, I’m going
to break his legs and..."

1264
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:06,582
"No, please, no!
- One leg then?"

1265
01:47:06,583 --> 01:47:10,083
No! He won’t look appealing
without his hands and feet

1266
01:47:10,625 --> 01:47:14,541
Just give him a light slap

1267
01:47:14,542 --> 01:47:16,874
There he is...
I’ll be hiding behind the tree

1268
01:47:16,875 --> 01:47:21,666
Let’s go

1269
01:47:29,542 --> 01:47:31,541
What’s your problem?

1270
01:47:31,542 --> 01:47:34,875
You dare toy with the womenfolk
of the Tiwari family?

1271
01:47:35,291 --> 01:47:40,125
Beat him up!

1272
01:47:41,583 --> 01:47:46,000
Where are you going...?
Who’s going to pick him up?

1273
01:47:49,625 --> 01:47:53,333
Hey mister... get up.
Your friends have left

1274
01:47:57,625 --> 01:48:00,916
You can’t use this telephone.
It’s meant for the staff

1275
01:48:00,917 --> 01:48:06,375
Everyone wants to use it

1276
01:48:13,709 --> 01:48:16,582
"Anjali, where have you been?
I want to meet you right now!"

1277
01:48:16,583 --> 01:48:20,166
"No, I can’t meet you right now.
I’m out shopping with my parents"

1278
01:48:20,709 --> 01:48:22,958
I’m calling you on the sly

1279
01:48:22,959 --> 01:48:24,958
How long are we going
to play hide and seek?

1280
01:48:24,959 --> 01:48:29,375
You’ve called me after five days!
You know how worried I’ve been?

1281
01:48:30,333 --> 01:48:33,416
"Hadn’t you phoned today, I was
about to go to your house"

1282
01:48:33,417 --> 01:48:36,709
"No, don’t do that.
If my Papa gets to know..."

1283
01:48:37,083 --> 01:48:40,375
He’s got to know already!
He sent goons to beat me up!

1284
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:46,666
But what’s God going to do?
I’ll have to do something on my own

1285
01:48:46,667 --> 01:48:51,166
Won’t I call you at your house if
I want to talk something official?

1286
01:48:51,709 --> 01:48:55,250
Which I did. But the old man
flared up and called me names

1287
01:48:55,750 --> 01:48:58,875
There was another bastard there
who was very rude

1288
01:48:59,709 --> 01:49:03,040
"God! Jeetu, don’t
call my place ever again"

1289
01:49:03,041 --> 01:49:05,708
I’ll give you a friend’s number.
Her name is Priya

1290
01:49:05,709 --> 01:49:10,333
The number is 6334523.
Call only in an emergency

1291
01:49:10,792 --> 01:49:14,624
"There is an emergency!
Now, this moment!"

1292
01:49:14,625 --> 01:49:18,083
"I want to ask you something, Anjali.
It has to do with my life and death"

1293
01:49:18,542 --> 01:49:23,749
"What?
- Do you love me, or don’t you?"

1294
01:49:23,750 --> 01:49:28,709
Say something.
I’m sure you love me...

1295
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:33,292
"but I want to hear you say it.
Say yes, just once..."

1296
01:49:33,709 --> 01:49:37,915
and I’m willing to take on
the whole world for you

1297
01:49:37,916 --> 01:49:41,040
"Jeetu, how will I say it?"

1298
01:49:41,041 --> 01:49:44,874
"Just once, say I love you"

1299
01:49:44,875 --> 01:49:49,332
"If you say no, I will
never call again"

1300
01:49:49,333 --> 01:49:52,791
Why don’t you say something?

1301
01:49:52,792 --> 01:49:55,833
Is the old man around...?
- Yes

1302
01:49:55,834 --> 01:50:00,333
"If you agree, you don’t
need to say anything"

1303
01:50:00,750 --> 01:50:04,667
"Just cut the line.
- Know the truth, Jeetu?"

1304
01:50:05,417 --> 01:50:08,915
How often will I tell you
not to use this phone?

1305
01:50:08,916 --> 01:50:13,000
Why did you get up from your bed?
Go and lie down

1306
01:50:29,875 --> 01:50:32,915
There’s this beautiful fairy...

1307
01:50:32,916 --> 01:50:35,915
"she has descended
from the skies..."

1308
01:50:35,916 --> 01:50:38,833
she stands before me...

1309
01:50:38,834 --> 01:50:42,750
"she’s the one I have
fallen in love with"

1310
01:50:44,834 --> 01:50:48,750
I have fallen in love with her

1311
01:51:14,833 --> 01:51:17,874
"She’s the light from
the Moon and the stars..."

1312
01:51:17,875 --> 01:51:20,915
she’s the lamp in a temple

1313
01:51:20,916 --> 01:51:26,750
"One glimpse of her
has driven me crazy"

1314
01:51:33,375 --> 01:51:38,750
"She’s the melody of my breath,
she means the world to me"

1315
01:51:39,375 --> 01:51:44,791
"What’s my heart, I could give my
life to her, if she asked me for it"

1316
01:51:51,875 --> 01:51:54,957
There’s this beautiful fairy...

1317
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:58,040
"she has descended
from the skies..."

1318
01:51:58,041 --> 01:52:00,832
she stands before me...

1319
01:52:00,833 --> 01:52:04,750
"she’s the one I have
fallen in love with"

1320
01:52:05,875 --> 01:52:10,208
I have fallen in love with her

1321
01:52:36,875 --> 01:52:40,166
"When she looks at me
with a smile..."

1322
01:52:40,167 --> 01:52:43,166
my heart goes out to her

1323
01:52:43,167 --> 01:52:48,875
"Her charms are
as enticing as she is"

1324
01:52:55,375 --> 01:53:00,500
"it’s her dreams I’m lost in,
all day and night..."

1325
01:53:01,208 --> 01:53:07,042
"she’s the one I see
when I awaken every morning"

1326
01:53:13,916 --> 01:53:17,041
There’s this beautiful fairy...

1327
01:53:17,042 --> 01:53:20,166
"she has descended
from the skies..."

1328
01:53:20,167 --> 01:53:23,041
she stands before me...

1329
01:53:23,042 --> 01:53:26,625
"she’s the one I have
fallen in love with"

1330
01:53:27,958 --> 01:53:32,292
I have fallen in love with her

1331
01:54:12,083 --> 01:54:17,082
I’m glad she’s taking a bath!

1332
01:54:17,083 --> 01:54:20,542
Anjali! I’m here to take you away!
Come on out!

1333
01:54:21,875 --> 01:54:24,583
What brings you here...?
Who are you?

1334
01:54:24,584 --> 01:54:27,041
You’ve forgotten me so soon?
- Oh yes

1335
01:54:27,042 --> 01:54:31,916
"My CD-player, TV set, oven, refrigerator
are all working very well. Go away"

1336
01:54:32,167 --> 01:54:35,958
"I request you one last time, sir.
Please don’t stop me"

1337
01:54:37,208 --> 01:54:40,082
"Give my Anjali to me
with your blessings,"

1338
01:54:40,083 --> 01:54:43,292
Don’t you feel any shame at all?

1339
01:54:43,625 --> 01:54:46,958
A boy and a girl love each other...
so what’s there to be ashamed about?

1340
01:54:47,542 --> 01:54:50,041
A girl?
- You think she’s an old hag?

1341
01:54:50,042 --> 01:54:54,958
I get it! You’ve fallen in love
with Anjali"s riches!

1342
01:54:55,417 --> 01:54:58,666
Tell me... how much money
do you want to forget Anjali?

1343
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:02,625
"Don’t weigh my love in the scale
of wealth, Radhesham Tiwari!"

1344
01:55:03,042 --> 01:55:06,292
"Shut up, you beggar!
What have you got to lose?"

1345
01:55:06,625 --> 01:55:09,958
I’ve earned name and respect
in this country and the world

1346
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:13,958
You spoke sweet words
and led her astray...

1347
01:55:14,250 --> 01:55:17,292
and she drove you crazy
with her silly antics

1348
01:55:17,625 --> 01:55:22,125
"But remember, she’ll never leave me
to go away with a pauper like you!"

1349
01:55:22,459 --> 01:55:25,958
"Really? If you’re so confident,
call her here, you old fossil!"

1350
01:55:26,375 --> 01:55:29,458
And ask her in my presence.
- I’ve asked her several times...

1351
01:55:29,459 --> 01:55:32,958
and she has answered me too!
- You’re lying to me!

1352
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:36,082
If she says the same thing
to me...

1353
01:55:36,083 --> 01:55:38,249
I’ll live all my life
with half a moustache!

1354
01:55:38,250 --> 01:55:42,459
"You need to have whiskers first.
Go away, before I call the police!"

1355
01:55:42,791 --> 01:55:46,833
"Not even the military can separate
two lovers, do you understand?"

1356
01:55:47,542 --> 01:55:52,000
I know you’ve locked Anjali upstairs.
- How did you get to know?

1357
01:55:52,459 --> 01:55:56,583
"What else can you do, Tiwari?
Quietly hand over Anjali to me..."

1358
01:55:56,750 --> 01:55:58,916
or I’ll have to go upstairs
and break the lock!

1359
01:55:58,917 --> 01:56:02,708
"To do that, you’ll have to
step over my dead body!"

1360
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:08,666
"That’s enough, Radhesham. If I don’t
take Anjali away in 24 hours..."

1361
01:56:08,958 --> 01:56:12,500
I won’t be Jeetu from Videocon!
- Think of another name. Go on!

1362
01:56:13,083 --> 01:56:16,082
"You have 24 hours, Tiwari"

1363
01:56:16,083 --> 01:56:21,875
"Stop me, if you’re
truly your mother’s son!"

1364
01:56:27,791 --> 01:56:33,000
Right now! I’m willing to pay
10 for each of them

1365
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:37,708
Send seven strong guys here right now.
And listen...

1366
01:56:38,167 --> 01:56:43,042
each one of them must wield a gun.
And every gun must work

1367
01:56:43,583 --> 01:56:48,625
"No, it’s not a bank.
I have a priceless antique item"

1368
01:56:49,167 --> 01:56:53,582
I can’t see it being robbed
in front of my eyes

1369
01:56:53,583 --> 01:56:57,499
The hospital bill is so high

1370
01:56:57,500 --> 01:57:04,375
I don’t know how I’ll ever repay you.
- Your husband has paid the bill

1371
01:57:04,833 --> 01:57:07,124
He borrowed the money from me
at 10 per cent interest

1372
01:57:07,125 --> 01:57:11,166
Not every girl has
a husband like yours

1373
01:57:11,167 --> 01:57:16,834
"Anjali, the taxi’s waiting"

1374
01:58:13,375 --> 01:58:16,791
Listen!

1375
01:58:16,792 --> 01:58:19,208
Let’s run away!
- Now?

1376
01:58:19,209 --> 01:58:21,832
Yes. I’m ready

1377
01:58:21,833 --> 01:58:24,999
"No, not now.
Maybe a few days later"

1378
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:28,208
You’ve always been saying later

1379
01:58:28,209 --> 01:58:32,167
"You haven’t fallen in love
with your fake wife, have you?"

1380
01:58:32,875 --> 01:58:35,916
"No, actually you’ve
misunderstood me"

1381
01:58:35,917 --> 01:58:38,208
That letter...
- It’s still with me

1382
01:58:38,209 --> 01:58:41,291
"If you betray me, I’ll have you
thrown out of this house..."

1383
01:58:41,292 --> 01:58:45,209
and I’ll show that letter to
everyone and give you a bad name

1384
01:58:45,792 --> 01:58:48,875
"Don’t do that. You are the one
I love, but I feel scared..."

1385
01:58:49,250 --> 01:58:53,000
"if Popat gets to know, he can send
us to jail with his money power"

1386
01:58:53,708 --> 01:58:56,291
All right. Come out

1387
01:58:56,292 --> 01:59:01,000
Come out!

1388
01:59:01,209 --> 01:59:04,291
You will do as I say.
- What?

1389
01:59:04,292 --> 01:59:06,624
The two of us will elope
in a few days

1390
01:59:06,625 --> 01:59:08,874
Where to?
- There is a place...

1391
01:59:08,875 --> 01:59:12,750
Popat can never get to!
- But...

1392
01:59:13,042 --> 01:59:16,208
Don’t worry. Just go and hide
in some cheap hotel

1393
01:59:16,209 --> 01:59:17,582
Where?

1394
01:59:17,583 --> 01:59:23,416
There’s a hotel opposite the station.
Stay there and behave like a madman

1395
01:59:23,792 --> 01:59:26,833
I’ll come there later and say that
you’ve escaped from the asylum

1396
01:59:27,209 --> 01:59:29,582
I’ll take you to
the railway station...

1397
01:59:29,583 --> 01:59:31,624
we’ll take a train and run away!

1398
01:59:31,625 --> 01:59:33,707
Is that necessary?
- Yes

1399
01:59:33,708 --> 01:59:37,041
"If we leave together,
Popat will get suspicious"

1400
01:59:37,042 --> 01:59:40,875
"If we leave separately, he won’t
even guess we’ve eloped together"

1401
01:59:41,292 --> 01:59:44,208
Someone’s going to help me!
- Who?

1402
01:59:44,209 --> 01:59:47,041
The police. Sub-inspector Waghmare

1403
01:59:47,042 --> 01:59:50,375
I know how to entice him.
Okay?

1404
01:59:51,292 --> 01:59:54,875
But make sure you carry
enough money from here

1405
01:59:55,458 --> 01:59:58,415
Don’t worry. I’ll take
so much cash and jewellery...

1406
01:59:58,416 --> 02:00:04,375
we’ll have a honeymoon
all our lives!

1407
02:00:07,375 --> 02:00:09,624
Rob something once

1408
02:00:09,625 --> 02:00:13,291
I’ll tell the Marwari and send you
away on a honeymoon forever

1409
02:00:14,625 --> 02:00:17,208
I know you’ve hidden
him somewhere!

1410
02:00:17,209 --> 02:00:20,959
Have you got rubbish for brains?
I’ve told you...

1411
02:00:21,375 --> 02:00:24,708
"I don’t have another son,
I don’t! I don’t!"

1412
02:00:25,541 --> 02:00:28,791
So who was he?
- How am I to know?

1413
02:00:28,792 --> 02:00:32,583
"Radhesham, don’t test
Teja"s patience!"

1414
02:00:33,042 --> 02:00:36,375
"So you don’t believe what I’m saying?
- No, I don’t!"

1415
02:00:36,625 --> 02:00:39,959
"Are you sure? 100 per cent?
- Sure, hundred per cent!"

1416
02:00:43,416 --> 02:00:46,415
Okay. So listen

1417
02:00:46,416 --> 02:00:49,874
The one you’re talking about
is my son

1418
02:00:49,875 --> 02:00:53,458
That he promised to marry
your daughter is also true

1419
02:00:53,833 --> 02:00:58,959
But I’m against the marriage.
So I’ve hidden him away somewhere

1420
02:00:59,375 --> 02:01:03,291
"Where I have hidden him, I’m not
in the mood to reveal to you"

1421
02:01:03,708 --> 02:01:06,707
Do what you will!
Go away!

1422
02:01:06,708 --> 02:01:09,832
You will now see
what stuff I’m made of

1423
02:01:09,833 --> 02:01:16,084
"Not only will I find your son,
if I don’t take the two of you..."

1424
02:01:16,416 --> 02:01:20,625
"beg in the local trains of Mumbai,
I won’t call myself Teja-bhai!"

1425
02:01:21,416 --> 02:01:25,250
Give me in the name of God!
- He speaks for the beggars too!

1426
02:01:27,416 --> 02:01:31,541
Radhe! Radhe!

1427
02:01:31,542 --> 02:01:35,457
Why did I leave my village
and come to this hell?

1428
02:01:35,458 --> 02:01:39,375
"Hey buddy, someone fishy staying here?
I’ve been sent by the Garbage King"

1429
02:01:41,333 --> 02:01:43,499
Talk to me

1430
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:44,958
You...

1431
02:01:44,959 --> 02:01:47,290
Ask me what you must to.
- Who are you?

1432
02:01:47,291 --> 02:01:49,624
Babu Bisleri. The mole

1433
02:01:49,625 --> 02:01:55,042
Is there someone hiding here?

1434
02:01:55,708 --> 02:02:01,000
"Yes, he’s the one"

1435
02:02:02,416 --> 02:02:07,875
Who is it?

1436
02:02:13,834 --> 02:02:18,499
"You?
- Yes, me"

1437
02:02:18,500 --> 02:02:20,833
Why have you come here?
- Where have you been hiding?

1438
02:02:20,834 --> 02:02:25,084
I went mad looking for you! You even
gave the hotelier an assumed name

1439
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:28,415
I went crazy banging
on every door!

1440
02:02:28,416 --> 02:02:30,499
I’m the one who has gone mad

1441
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:33,499
You said your employer
would go back in a week

1442
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:36,750
"He’s not willing to budge,
so what do I do? Rot here?"

1443
02:02:37,583 --> 02:02:42,208
It’s got to be very dangerous.
Had I stayed there another minute...

1444
02:02:42,667 --> 02:02:45,958
I’d have been crushed between
garbage and my employer

1445
02:02:45,959 --> 02:02:49,042
Never mind. There’s no point
staying holed up here

1446
02:02:49,542 --> 02:02:53,458
I need to decide something.
- The Garbage King has already decided

1447
02:02:53,917 --> 02:02:57,291
The marriage is not taking place.
He’s out to kill you

1448
02:02:57,625 --> 02:02:59,874
If the marriage does not
take place before that...

1449
02:02:59,875 --> 02:03:03,084
"He’ll beat me to pulp, right?
Never mind that"

1450
02:03:03,667 --> 02:03:06,666
Here’s what you’ll do.
I’ll give you a letter

1451
02:03:06,667 --> 02:03:10,959
Quietly go and give it to Madhuri.
No one must get to know

1452
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:14,750
Write the letter by all means.
And also give me 200 rupees

1453
02:03:15,208 --> 02:03:17,707
I’ll immediately take
the letter to Madhuri...

1454
02:03:17,708 --> 02:03:23,125
and no one will get to know!

1455
02:03:30,542 --> 02:03:32,874
Swine! What did you think?

1456
02:03:32,875 --> 02:03:36,000
You’d promise marriage and toy
with my daughter’s honour?

1457
02:03:36,333 --> 02:03:40,875
You must’ve betrayed a lot of girls.
But you can’t deceive me!

1458
02:03:41,417 --> 02:03:43,374
Forgive me!
- Open the door...

1459
02:03:43,375 --> 02:03:48,208
"else, I’ll break it down!
I’ll break every bone in your body..."

1460
02:03:48,667 --> 02:03:52,083
string it in a garland and put it
around your arrogant father’s neck!

1461
02:03:52,708 --> 02:03:56,165
Open the door!

1462
02:03:56,166 --> 02:03:58,541
Sonofagun! What do you think?

1463
02:03:58,542 --> 02:04:01,457
You’ll hide here and
I won’t be able to find you?

1464
02:04:01,458 --> 02:04:05,500
I can look at a fly and tell you
whether it’s male or female!

1465
02:04:05,959 --> 02:04:09,541
Open the door!
- Chhota Chetan"s thugs!

1466
02:04:09,542 --> 02:04:12,708
I don’t want to marry her.
Leave me alone!

1467
02:04:12,709 --> 02:04:16,082
"I’m here for your funeral,
not your wedding procession!"

1468
02:04:16,083 --> 02:04:19,166
I don’t want to marry her!
I’ll go far away from her!

1469
02:04:19,625 --> 02:04:23,082
Shut up! You won’t get the girl
even in your dreams!

1470
02:04:23,083 --> 02:04:25,624
"I’m going to kill you!
Come on out, you swine!"

1471
02:04:25,625 --> 02:04:27,624
Break the door

1472
02:04:27,625 --> 02:04:33,291
Make mincemeat out of him
and lay him at my feet!

1473
02:04:35,333 --> 02:04:40,042
Thrash him!

1474
02:04:41,625 --> 02:04:45,542
You play a drama with me?
Get up!

1475
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:52,249
Who’s this?

1476
02:04:52,250 --> 02:04:55,582
You said that scoundrel
was hiding in there!

1477
02:04:55,583 --> 02:04:58,416
That scoundrel told me.
- Shut up!

1478
02:04:58,417 --> 02:05:01,541
Leave this clown alone.
And find that son of a bitch.

1479
02:05:01,542 --> 02:05:02,624
Come on

1480
02:05:02,625 --> 02:05:05,875
Hit me! Thrash me!
Don’t let me live anymore!

1481
02:05:06,291 --> 02:05:09,624
Just about anyone comes along
and gives me a thrashing!

1482
02:05:09,625 --> 02:05:15,666
When is the railway strike ending?

1483
02:05:20,542 --> 02:05:24,125
I’m glad you came soon.
Whom do you wish to see?

1484
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:58,958
"I’ll do it for you, but the documents
of my house and 50,000 rupees..."

1485
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:04,250
you must quietly bring
and give it to me

1486
02:06:04,583 --> 02:06:08,958
"Sure, I’ll do that.
- I haven’t seen... the party"

1487
02:06:09,583 --> 02:06:12,708
Can I see him once?
- You’ll find him at Welcome Lodge

1488
02:06:12,709 --> 02:06:16,040
"If I ask for Nandu at Welcome Lodge,
will they tell me?"

1489
02:06:16,041 --> 02:06:18,749
"No, he’s going to stay there
under an assumed name"

1490
02:06:18,750 --> 02:06:22,958
I’ve asked him to pretend madness.
That’s how you will recognize him

1491
02:06:23,709 --> 02:06:27,417
"Welcome Lodge? All right, I’ll go
to Welcome Lodge and meet your punter"

1492
02:06:27,750 --> 02:06:30,708
I’ll tell him that
you’ve sent me

1493
02:06:30,709 --> 02:06:35,625
"I’ll get him out of there and have
him at the train, the very next day"

1494
02:06:36,041 --> 02:06:40,166
I’ll be there! Nandu and I will
run away from there!

1495
02:06:44,166 --> 02:06:47,208
Is there someone here
who’s off his rocker?

1496
02:06:49,750 --> 02:06:53,040
Is there a madman here?

1497
02:06:53,041 --> 02:06:57,333
Ask the boss.
- Don’t you act funny with me

1498
02:06:57,709 --> 02:07:00,708
I’m warning you!
I know it for a fact...

1499
02:07:00,709 --> 02:07:04,040
that a madman has run away from
the asylum and is hiding here!

1500
02:07:04,041 --> 02:07:07,040
"A madman...?
So say that clearly, sir!"

1501
02:07:07,041 --> 02:07:10,458
That madman is surely hiding here!
- Who?

1502
02:07:27,709 --> 02:07:29,999
This one’s sure a nut.
- A policeman!

1503
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:34,667
Officer! Get me out of here!
I’m in a bad jam!

1504
02:07:35,250 --> 02:07:39,333
They’re coming to take you away.
- I’ll leave on my own

1505
02:07:39,709 --> 02:07:43,040
How can you go away just like that?
- What will you do about it?

1506
02:07:43,041 --> 02:07:46,417
You can’t go away. Everyone knows
you’re crazy... you’re mad

1507
02:07:46,833 --> 02:07:50,375
"Officer, they’re hand in glove.
I’ll tell you about them"

1508
02:07:50,709 --> 02:07:53,040
Hands off me.
- I’ll explain

1509
02:07:53,041 --> 02:07:56,166
"They want to prove that I’m mad,
take me away from here..."

1510
02:07:56,167 --> 02:07:59,750
so Chhota Chetan can kill me!
- See?

1511
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:05,541
I told you he’s mad!
He talks any nonsense

1512
02:08:06,083 --> 02:08:09,667
Get out... move it!
- He gets into fights!

1513
02:08:11,792 --> 02:08:14,040
So he’s one of them too!

1514
02:08:14,041 --> 02:08:18,915
Why have you shut the door?
Why?

1515
02:08:18,916 --> 02:08:20,999
Come here!
- What for?

1516
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:24,040
I’ve got to tell you something.
- No thanks. Let me go

1517
02:08:24,041 --> 02:08:27,750
"You needn’t worry, feller.
I’m Inspector Waghmare"

1518
02:08:28,041 --> 02:08:31,624
The other party has sent me here.
- The other party?

1519
02:08:31,625 --> 02:08:34,832
The other party will arrive
exactly at 10 to take you away

1520
02:08:34,833 --> 02:08:38,417
We got together and made the plan
to deliver you there

1521
02:08:38,833 --> 02:08:40,874
Are you one with them?
- Yes

1522
02:08:40,875 --> 02:08:45,083
God! Now I know why the police
are terrified of Chhota Chetan!

1523
02:08:47,375 --> 02:08:49,957
Damn it!

1524
02:08:49,958 --> 02:08:57,459
I can’t figure out how such an
atom bomb fell in love with you!

1525
02:08:57,875 --> 02:09:00,874
"Not she, I was the one who "fell"
"Ever since I was a child"

1526
02:09:00,875 --> 02:09:04,166
Since you were a child?
- I never imagined...

1527
02:09:04,167 --> 02:09:07,832
this would happen to me!
I’m leaving!

1528
02:09:07,833 --> 02:09:09,874
I’m going!

1529
02:09:09,875 --> 02:09:14,459
People will really think you’re mad.
- I’m not mad!

1530
02:09:19,041 --> 02:09:21,874
Get him!

1531
02:09:21,875 --> 02:09:27,291
Hold tight!

1532
02:09:42,875 --> 02:09:46,833
"Tomorrow morning, she and I will
come to take him away"

1533
02:09:47,292 --> 02:09:49,874
His expenses...

1534
02:09:49,875 --> 02:09:53,041
you will bear.
- Will I get some tips first?

1535
02:09:53,042 --> 02:09:57,875
"Sure, if he runs away,
you’ll get a tight slap"

1536
02:10:01,042 --> 02:10:04,041
What are you telling me...?
Anil has gone mad?

1537
02:10:04,042 --> 02:10:07,041
He doesn’t step out of the room.
He’s the only man...

1538
02:10:07,042 --> 02:10:10,374
who’s living under an assumed name.
- It must be Anil then

1539
02:10:10,375 --> 02:10:15,875
"He wrote to me that he’s hiding here.
- "That girl has betrayed me", he says"

1540
02:10:16,375 --> 02:10:20,875
"He misunderstands you and says,
Kill me! Kill me!"

1541
02:10:21,292 --> 02:10:25,708
"Maybe he’s scared of your papa.
Right now, he’s been hidden somewhere"

1542
02:10:26,334 --> 02:10:30,166
"Tomorrow morning, they are
taking him to the asylum"

1543
02:10:30,167 --> 02:10:34,041
"Madhuri, why are you crying?"

1544
02:10:34,042 --> 02:10:40,416
He’s in this state
only because of me!

1545
02:10:41,083 --> 02:10:44,249
I’ve been wanting to tell you
something for a long time

1546
02:10:44,250 --> 02:10:47,041
Go ahead

1547
02:10:47,042 --> 02:10:51,666
"I’m not a singer, like you think.
I come from a rich family"

1548
02:10:53,250 --> 02:10:57,041
There was no dearth of riches
and comforts in my house

1549
02:10:57,042 --> 02:11:00,041
But my parents were
against my music

1550
02:11:00,042 --> 02:11:03,334
"They wanted me to take over the family
business, and I didn’t want to"

1551
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:07,375
I began to feel suffocated there
and I ran away from home

1552
02:11:11,375 --> 02:11:15,958
Why’ve you telling me all that?
- The drama we’re both enacting...

1553
02:11:16,417 --> 02:11:22,458
could we really...?

1554
02:11:42,167 --> 02:11:45,666
They’re here to take him away.
Did he cause problems last night?

1555
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:49,374
"He did, I banged the hammer
on his head and..."

1556
02:11:49,375 --> 02:11:52,541
Is he dead?
- No. Plastic cups don’t break easily

1557
02:11:52,542 --> 02:11:55,625
I got to hammer his head again
and take him away

1558
02:11:56,666 --> 02:12:00,958
I’ll play the music for him.
It’s days since I beat up someone

1559
02:12:17,542 --> 02:12:23,500
I’m mad! I’m a lunatic!

1560
02:12:36,791 --> 02:12:40,209
Not so much over-acting...
don’t go overboard!

1561
02:12:49,167 --> 02:12:54,374
He’s begun to speak!
He’s not dumb!

1562
02:12:54,375 --> 02:12:58,083
"I’ll carve you to pieces!
Either you live, or l"

1563
02:12:58,541 --> 02:13:01,374
I’ll kill you first
and die afterwards!

1564
02:13:01,375 --> 02:13:04,333
"Yes, carve me to pieces,
kill me! Hack me!"

1565
02:13:04,334 --> 02:13:07,166
"Calm down, Anjali"

1566
02:13:07,167 --> 02:13:10,666
What will you get out of yelling?
It’ll only attract the neighbours

1567
02:13:11,167 --> 02:13:14,124
"If you lose your respect,
how will you live with honour?"

1568
02:13:14,125 --> 02:13:16,540
What respect is left
to be lost anyway?

1569
02:13:16,541 --> 02:13:20,000
Look at this letter!
Written by her lover!

1570
02:13:20,541 --> 02:13:27,083
"My dear Anjali, our hearts
met and united at my shop"

1571
02:13:28,167 --> 02:13:32,083
"I know, that old man
is a shackle in your feet"

1572
02:13:32,583 --> 02:13:38,541
"I did what I could
to reason with that scoundrel..."

1573
02:13:38,875 --> 02:13:42,166
but he just won’t agree!
- Lies! This is a pack of lies!

1574
02:13:42,167 --> 02:13:44,249
I’ll hack you to pieces!
He further writes...

1575
02:13:44,250 --> 02:13:51,666
"There’s just one way left. Tonight,
I’ll quietly rescue you from that hell"

1576
02:13:52,958 --> 02:13:57,500
Read it for yourself!
Why do it on the sly?

1577
02:13:57,958 --> 02:14:01,041
"Go away openly! Before that,
end your relationship with me!"

1578
02:14:01,042 --> 02:14:03,957
He got someone to write the letter!
He wants to throw me out so he...

1579
02:14:03,958 --> 02:14:07,166
can bring that young girl home.
- Which young girl!

1580
02:14:07,167 --> 02:14:09,957
No wonder he’s putting all these
false proofs together!

1581
02:14:09,958 --> 02:14:13,166
But that’s not happening!
I will go away...

1582
02:14:13,167 --> 02:14:18,417
I brought three cars full of gold...
- You want that back with interest?

1583
02:14:18,875 --> 02:14:20,624
Yes!
- That’s what you want?

1584
02:14:20,625 --> 02:14:22,291
I’m not giving it!

1585
02:14:22,292 --> 02:14:24,707
I’m not parting with a penny.
Do what you can!

1586
02:14:24,708 --> 02:14:28,125
"Go away and file a case.
Before that, leave the world!"

1587
02:14:31,083 --> 02:14:34,875
Weep on Videocon"s shoulders!
Don’t shed tears here

1588
02:14:35,334 --> 02:14:40,500
I know Anjali very well. She can’t
have an affair like the one you say

1589
02:14:40,917 --> 02:14:44,208
"You mean, he’s having an affair?
I know Mr. Tiwari very well"

1590
02:14:44,209 --> 02:14:46,540
He’s not that kind of a man!

1591
02:14:46,541 --> 02:14:50,041
"The less said about your knowledge,
the better!"

1592
02:14:50,042 --> 02:14:53,249
"Sir, trusting womenfolk
is like committing suicide"

1593
02:14:53,250 --> 02:14:56,708
I suspect you too are having
an affair behind my back!

1594
02:14:58,250 --> 02:15:01,833
Lawyer! Are you here to sort out my
problem or create one for yourself?

1595
02:15:02,250 --> 02:15:05,957
"No, sir. We must solve
this puzzle"

1596
02:15:05,958 --> 02:15:09,374
We can decide it only after we
get to know who’s behind all this

1597
02:15:09,375 --> 02:15:12,291
Who’s that boy?
Let’s call him here

1598
02:15:12,292 --> 02:15:15,540
Oh yes. Let’s decide this
once and for all

1599
02:15:15,541 --> 02:15:18,208
"I’ll call that boy right here.
- No, sir..."

1600
02:15:18,209 --> 02:15:20,540
I have a condition before
you call that boy here

1601
02:15:20,541 --> 02:15:22,874
You’re a very hot-tempered man.
- Give that to me

1602
02:15:22,875 --> 02:15:26,625
"You will reason with that boy,
without getting excited..."

1603
02:15:27,042 --> 02:15:30,374
or creating any scenes.
It ought to remain in the family

1604
02:15:30,375 --> 02:15:32,624
The two of us will go inside...

1605
02:15:32,625 --> 02:15:35,875
he mustn’t think you’re humiliating
him in front of the world

1606
02:16:05,209 --> 02:16:08,041
"Speak up, Tiwari.
Here I am"

1607
02:16:08,042 --> 02:16:11,041
"Did you write this letter, Romeo?
- What?"

1608
02:16:11,042 --> 02:16:14,458
"Anjali, our hearts...
- Yes, I wrote it"

1609
02:16:15,416 --> 02:16:19,750
You wrote this letter despite knowing
what the consequences would be?

1610
02:16:20,167 --> 02:16:23,041
Yes.
- Since you have so much courage...

1611
02:16:23,042 --> 02:16:26,625
"tell me to my face,
how much do you love Anjali?"

1612
02:16:27,167 --> 02:16:30,041
Anjali means the life to me!

1613
02:16:30,042 --> 02:16:35,709
You want to hear that again?
- Lawyer!

1614
02:16:36,209 --> 02:16:41,250
You?
- Papa!

1615
02:16:43,167 --> 02:16:46,499
So you were born of him...?
It makes sense then

1616
02:16:46,500 --> 02:16:50,333
"When the brand itself is faulty,
this is how the showroom will be!"

1617
02:16:50,708 --> 02:16:54,041
Boys are often naughty
at this age

1618
02:16:54,042 --> 02:16:57,291
"But the womenfolk must preserve
their honour, mustn’t they?"

1619
02:16:57,625 --> 02:17:01,042
"Watch your tongue, lawyer!
- I see! The bitter truth!"

1620
02:17:01,458 --> 02:17:04,625
"Whatever my son’s character,
he’s surely better than you are!"

1621
02:17:05,291 --> 02:17:08,833
You don’t even know how many sons
of yours are roaming the city!

1622
02:17:09,333 --> 02:17:12,290
What rubbish!
- Listen boy. Speak the truth

1623
02:17:12,291 --> 02:17:16,332
Did I ever tell you
that I’m in love with you?

1624
02:17:16,333 --> 02:17:18,166
No.
- So then?

1625
02:17:18,167 --> 02:17:21,249
"I’ve been talking
about Anjali, his daughter"

1626
02:17:21,250 --> 02:17:25,042
My daughter Anjali...?
Which new daughter is that...?

1627
02:17:25,458 --> 02:17:27,832
You also have another daughter!

1628
02:17:27,833 --> 02:17:31,708
He’s lying! Absolutely!
- O God! What am I hearing?

1629
02:17:32,125 --> 02:17:36,291
It’s lies!
- Something’s happening to me...

1630
02:17:38,250 --> 02:17:41,833
Tell me the truth. How many wives
and children do you have?

1631
02:17:42,250 --> 02:17:45,667
My darling wife! He’s lying!
- You’re the one who’s lying

1632
02:17:46,416 --> 02:17:50,415
I used to drop her here
every evening!

1633
02:17:50,416 --> 02:17:54,000
One moment...
where’s that girl right now?

1634
02:17:54,416 --> 02:17:56,874
"Papa, this old man must’ve
hidden her somewhere"

1635
02:17:56,875 --> 02:18:01,291
God! What a monster!
- He’s lying

1636
02:18:03,375 --> 02:18:08,333
"Do you have any contact number?
- Yes, I have her friend’s number"

1637
02:18:08,833 --> 02:18:12,084
"Ask her where she is. Call her here.
- Yes, call her here!"

1638
02:18:19,167 --> 02:18:21,290
This is our Nandu!

1639
02:18:21,291 --> 02:18:25,667
"He has run away from home.
The informer will be paid 200,000"

1640
02:18:26,167 --> 02:18:32,333
"200,000! Popat!
You’ve hit the jackpot of 200,000!"

1641
02:18:33,416 --> 02:18:38,000
"Let me see how you step out.
It has to do with 200,000 rupees"

1642
02:18:41,500 --> 02:18:45,250
"How did you get there?
- Popatji, I’m leaving"

1643
02:18:45,708 --> 02:18:48,207
Leaving? How can you leave
just like that?

1644
02:18:48,208 --> 02:18:51,457
Your picture has been
published in the newspapers!

1645
02:18:51,458 --> 02:18:55,290
"The one who takes you home
will get 200,000 rupees"

1646
02:18:55,291 --> 02:19:00,375
"Don’t mess with my reward, please.
Stop there... stop!"

1647
02:19:10,084 --> 02:19:13,374
Remember something...?
Isn’t she your daughter?

1648
02:19:13,375 --> 02:19:15,499
"Sorry, I made a mistake"

1649
02:19:15,500 --> 02:19:20,000
They met in the garden as
father and daughter. God!

1650
02:19:20,458 --> 02:19:24,375
"Take me away!
- God isn’t a weight lifter, fat lady!"

1651
02:19:24,792 --> 02:19:26,249
Shut up!

1652
02:19:26,250 --> 02:19:30,249
My child... am I your father?

1653
02:19:30,250 --> 02:19:34,000
"You call her "My child" and ask her
whether you’re her father!"

1654
02:19:34,416 --> 02:19:38,458
Shut up... my child...
am I your father?

1655
02:19:39,291 --> 02:19:42,499
Hurry up and speak.
It has to do with my married life!

1656
02:19:42,500 --> 02:19:45,541
No

1657
02:19:45,542 --> 02:19:48,750
What nonsense! You told me
that you’re his daughter!

1658
02:19:49,250 --> 02:19:52,499
That he hates the idea of you
working in my store!

1659
02:19:52,500 --> 02:19:56,666
And I even met you
at this very place!

1660
02:19:56,667 --> 02:19:59,917
Please forgive me

1661
02:20:01,542 --> 02:20:05,290
All these misunderstandings
are taking place because of me

1662
02:20:05,291 --> 02:20:08,290
But please hear me out once

1663
02:20:08,291 --> 02:20:13,000
"After that whatever
punishment you give me, I will accept"

1664
02:20:13,542 --> 02:20:17,000
I came to this city
to look for a job

1665
02:20:18,042 --> 02:20:21,291
"Despite the best of my efforts,
I couldn’t find one"

1666
02:20:22,083 --> 02:20:27,125
And when I got the opportunity
to work at his showroom...

1667
02:20:27,583 --> 02:20:33,667
I didn’t want to lose it.
So I spoke one lie after another

1668
02:20:34,375 --> 02:20:39,250
"To hide one lie,
I had to lie many more times"

1669
02:20:39,959 --> 02:20:42,416
That’s the truth

1670
02:20:42,417 --> 02:20:48,750
"After a very long time,
I’ve spoken the truth today"

1671
02:20:50,375 --> 02:20:54,624
"Don’t cry, my child"

1672
02:20:54,625 --> 02:20:58,041
What has happened is in the past.
We hold nothing against you

1673
02:20:59,750 --> 02:21:04,166
Where is your other son?
- There she goes again!

1674
02:21:04,583 --> 02:21:06,624
You want to see? You want to?

1675
02:21:06,625 --> 02:21:08,624
I come here for the last time!

1676
02:21:08,625 --> 02:21:11,416
"One problem ends,
another one begins!"

1677
02:21:11,417 --> 02:21:15,542
"Welcome, you’re the one we were missing.
- It’s either this way or that today!"

1678
02:21:16,375 --> 02:21:20,208
You folks don’t know what a
dirty rotten scoundrel I am!

1679
02:21:20,625 --> 02:21:23,875
I knew that the moment I saw you.
- Silence!

1680
02:21:24,417 --> 02:21:26,958
Where is my daughter?
- What? His daughter?

1681
02:21:26,959 --> 02:21:31,875
He always asked where my son was!
And now he asks where his daughter is!

1682
02:21:32,375 --> 02:21:35,666
Do you suffer from an affliction?
- When you got to know...

1683
02:21:35,667 --> 02:21:38,666
that I’d have my daughter
married to your son...

1684
02:21:38,667 --> 02:21:42,041
you had my daughter kidnapped!
Where is my daughter?

1685
02:21:42,542 --> 02:21:46,250
She has married me and is
very happy to be with me

1686
02:21:46,709 --> 02:21:49,999
What are you going to do...?
- I’ll take your life!

1687
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:53,250
It’s not a toy.
You might kill me! Put it away!

1688
02:21:53,709 --> 02:21:57,417
Shut up! I could pump your body
with lead anyway!

1689
02:21:58,375 --> 02:22:02,208
I know all of you are
conspiring against me!

1690
02:22:02,625 --> 02:22:06,208
So everyone’s going with me.
If anyone refuses...

1691
02:22:06,667 --> 02:22:12,833
it’ll be his last refusal!
Move it!

1692
02:22:28,792 --> 02:22:35,125
"I’m going to bite you back,
you dog!"

1693
02:22:40,709 --> 02:22:46,167
Stop there!
- Get him!

1694
02:22:54,500 --> 02:22:59,167
Get him!

1695
02:23:07,709 --> 02:23:13,916
"This is no garden,
it’s my den. The den of death"

1696
02:23:14,875 --> 02:23:17,708
Where’s my daughter?
- It’s coming out of my ears!

1697
02:23:17,709 --> 02:23:22,333
"From my house to here,
you asked me a hundred times!"

1698
02:23:22,750 --> 02:23:26,416
Which language you do understand?
- Where is my daughter?

1699
02:23:26,417 --> 02:23:31,500
"Tell me, else I’ll kill you!"

1700
02:23:31,625 --> 02:23:36,458
You hit me!

1701
02:23:49,542 --> 02:23:54,167
Wait there...

1702
02:24:08,208 --> 02:24:13,334
You kiss my wife!

1703
02:24:13,750 --> 02:24:18,833
You dare kiss my Mom!

1704
02:24:21,542 --> 02:24:24,791
Freeze! I’ve got a pistol!
Stay where you are!

1705
02:24:24,792 --> 02:24:29,625
"One, two..."

1706
02:24:41,250 --> 02:24:47,583
"Your father was dead, isn’t it?
His son dies now!"

1707
02:24:50,709 --> 02:24:55,167
Hey loony!

1708
02:24:56,625 --> 02:24:59,166
Quiet! Hands up!

1709
02:24:59,167 --> 02:25:00,832
How will I?

1710
02:25:00,833 --> 02:25:04,167
Tell me where my daughter is.
- She has committed suicide

1711
02:25:04,584 --> 02:25:07,416
She has ended her life
in a dry well!

1712
02:25:07,417 --> 02:25:11,875
You poke fun at me...?
The slugs in this gun are real

1713
02:25:12,250 --> 02:25:18,042
You want to see? You want to...?
Take a look

1714
02:25:42,375 --> 02:25:45,625
Nobody moves!
Else you’re dead-meat!

1715
02:25:46,875 --> 02:25:50,874
"Stick your hands up,
or I’ll send you to hell!"

1716
02:25:50,875 --> 02:25:54,958
Hey hero... you want me to
send you through the mobile?

1717
02:25:55,375 --> 02:26:00,667
Stick your hands up! Go on!

1718
02:26:31,167 --> 02:26:35,917
Listen...

1719
02:26:39,708 --> 02:26:45,084
How much more
will you make me run?

1720
02:27:05,708 --> 02:27:09,333
Got a match?

1721
02:27:09,334 --> 02:27:14,500
"Anjali, where are you?"

1722
02:27:30,958 --> 02:27:36,792
Don’t let anyone escape!

1723
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,915
"Everything’s suddenly
so quiet, isn’t it?"

1724
02:27:47,916 --> 02:27:51,417
"Like the clouds clearing,
after a storm"

1725
02:27:51,875 --> 02:27:57,000
A lot of things are clear surely

1726
02:27:59,042 --> 02:28:05,208
"I admit, I loved you because I
thought you were Tiwari"s daughter"

1727
02:28:06,958 --> 02:28:12,375
I have to give some girl
the charge to my life some day

1728
02:28:14,584 --> 02:28:20,416
"So I thought, why not..."

1729
02:28:22,791 --> 02:28:26,958
Jeetu says he wants to marry me

1730
02:28:29,833 --> 02:28:32,041
Nandu says that too

1731
02:28:32,042 --> 02:28:39,375
Nandu and I have been pretending
to be man and wife for many days

1732
02:28:41,042 --> 02:28:45,958
So that consideration
Nandu must surely get

1733
02:28:46,625 --> 02:28:50,000
So you’ll marry both of us?
- No

1734
02:28:50,791 --> 02:28:54,000
"Actually, during the melee
that took place..."

1735
02:28:54,542 --> 02:28:58,791
I found a way out of this dilemma.
- What?

1736
02:29:01,875 --> 02:29:06,666
I’ve written both names
on these chits

1737
02:29:07,042 --> 02:29:10,625
"Whichever name comes up,
I’ll marry him"

1738
02:29:12,042 --> 02:29:16,625
"Nandu, you pick a chit.
- I won’t! I always lose!"

1739
02:29:17,042 --> 02:29:20,625
"No, not me! I always lose!
- We have no other way, Nandu"

1740
02:29:21,042 --> 02:29:24,957
I’m not picking lots.
- I’ve prayed to God...

1741
02:29:24,958 --> 02:29:29,416
He’ll help me choose the right boy

1742
02:29:29,417 --> 02:29:35,625
"Jeetu, you pick a slip"

1743
02:29:53,875 --> 02:29:59,000
I knew I’d lose!

1744
02:30:28,209 --> 02:30:33,250
Nandu in this one too?
