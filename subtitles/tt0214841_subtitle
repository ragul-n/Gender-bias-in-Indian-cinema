1
00:00:17,564 --> 00:00:20,158
Today the documents and proofs
that Ravi Verma has..

2
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:23,100
..presented for the property
case of Ravi Verma..

3
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,105
..and Surjuda, it clearly states
that Ooty command's..

4
00:00:26,173 --> 00:00:29,165
..entire property's real
proprietor was Ravi Verma's..

5
00:00:29,242 --> 00:00:32,040
..late father Mr. Shanta
Prasad Verma.

6
00:00:32,112 --> 00:00:35,548
He had given partnership
to Surjuda because of..

7
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:38,379
..his friendship and trust.
But after his death..

8
00:00:38,452 --> 00:00:41,114
..now Surjuda wants to capture
his entire property..

9
00:00:41,188 --> 00:00:44,123
..from his helpless
family and son.

10
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:47,126
So the judge's decision is that
this entire tea estate of..

11
00:00:47,194 --> 00:00:50,129
..Ooty command, tea factories
and palace that were of..

12
00:00:50,197 --> 00:00:53,598
..Mr. Shanta Prasad, it
must be handed over to..

13
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:55,396
..Ravi Verma and not to Surjuda.

14
00:01:04,678 --> 00:01:06,077
We've won the case, Kamini.

15
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:11,083
l'm so happy.

16
00:01:16,556 --> 00:01:22,085
5th January, 1959. Today Surjuda
has lost the case.

17
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:26,689
And only you're responsible
for this. Mr. P. P. Roy.

18
00:01:27,434 --> 00:01:29,095
The famous advocate of lndia.

19
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,034
But, sir. l don't know how
that boy presented..

20
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:34,505
..the real documents in the court.

21
00:01:34,574 --> 00:01:36,041
And he reversed the entire case.

22
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:39,545
And now Surjuda is thinking
of reversing you.

23
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:41,547
But sir, we'll go to
the supreme court.

24
00:01:41,615 --> 00:01:44,641
God didn't give the
speech to Surjuda..

25
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:47,118
..but He has surely
given him a brain.

26
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:50,053
There'll be some other advocate..

27
00:01:50,123 --> 00:01:53,217
..in the supreme court, Mr.
P. P. Roy, not you.

28
00:02:02,235 --> 00:02:04,396
Come, Kamini. Come, Charanjeet.

29
00:02:09,075 --> 00:02:11,066
Surjuda says that we've come
to know that Ravi Verma..

30
00:02:11,144 --> 00:02:13,078
..loves your sister? ls it true?

31
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,071
My sister has an affair
with many people.

32
00:02:16,149 --> 00:02:18,083
But this boy is very rich, sir.

33
00:02:21,154 --> 00:02:24,089
Then you and your sister
both can become rich.

34
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:27,086
How?

35
00:02:29,162 --> 00:02:32,029
lf you get marry with Ravi
Verma before 8th January..

36
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:34,032
..and become Mrs. Ravi Verma.

37
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:37,535
And by the 1 1th of January
if you become a widow.

38
00:02:37,604 --> 00:02:39,037
l mean Ravi Verma..

39
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:45,205
And by the12th of January
if you hand over..

40
00:02:45,278 --> 00:02:49,112
..all his wills papers to us
then by the 15th of January..

41
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:51,116
..we'll make you the
queen of that estate.

42
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:54,210
But who will the real possessor
of the property?

43
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:58,056
lt'll be Surjuda.

44
00:03:00,126 --> 00:03:02,560
You'll get 25000 rupees per month.

45
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:04,563
And Ooty's palace will be
transferred to your name.

46
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:11,234
But if you change your mind
after being the queen..

47
00:03:11,304 --> 00:03:14,398
..then you also will be
lying dead like him.

48
00:03:15,675 --> 00:03:17,074
My advance?

49
00:03:26,553 --> 00:03:29,078
Congratulation! Congratulation,
brother-in-law!

50
00:03:29,155 --> 00:03:31,180
What are you waiting for?
Click the photos.

51
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:33,624
C'mon, hurry up. Yes, click.
C'mon, once more.

52
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:35,092
C'mon.

53
00:03:38,632 --> 00:03:41,362
Ramsingh. Get that luggage
down. Hurry up!

54
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:45,532
Congratulation, queen. l
also came to know that..

55
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:49,701
..your son has won the case.
- But you didn't give me..

56
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:51,539
..the real congratulations. You
didn't see this decoration?

57
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:53,545
These arrangements?

58
00:03:53,613 --> 00:03:56,207
l didn't get you.
- l'll tell you, uncle.

59
00:03:56,283 --> 00:03:57,580
Brother has got married in..

60
00:03:57,651 --> 00:03:59,118
..Mumbai and is coming here
with sister in law.

61
00:03:59,185 --> 00:04:01,050
That's why mummy is so happy.

62
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:06,525
He got married? - Mr. Satnam,
the time is changing.

63
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,223
Now the parent's life's aim is
their children's happiness.

64
00:04:12,132 --> 00:04:14,225
Mr. Sharma, did you send
the special car..

65
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:16,064
..for Ravi at the station?
- Yes, queen.

66
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:18,229
But sir has decided to
come alone by the jeep.

67
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:20,569
But why he did this?
- You'll never understand him..

68
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,574
..mummy. Brother is very clever.

69
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:25,135
He might be showing the estate
to my sister in law..

70
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:27,076
..and making his impression.

71
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:09,111
Very nice. Kamini, you know
l love this tune very much.

72
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,215
lt seems the radio station also
have come to know that l'm..

73
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:14,055
..taking away my bride at my home.

74
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:16,388
Thank you radios broadcasting
station.

75
00:05:16,463 --> 00:05:18,055
Thank you very much.

76
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:29,226
Kamini, this is our tea factory.
Verma tea estate.

77
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:50,088
Hi Robert! How are you?
- Bye!

78
00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:08,197
What happened?
- Your jeep is not ready to move.

79
00:07:08,274 --> 00:07:11,107
No, madam. Actually, my
jeep has given me..

80
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:13,372
..a chance to do some romance.

81
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:17,542
Do you want to reach home or not?
- Home?

82
00:07:17,617 --> 00:07:19,050
Oh yes! Yes!

83
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,051
Today mummy will get angry on me.

84
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:24,056
lf her son will go out
somewhere alone.

85
00:07:24,124 --> 00:07:25,182
She'll make all the telephones..

86
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:27,123
..and wirelesses of
the city occupied.

87
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:30,323
There's no water in the regulator.

88
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:35,534
Ok. l'll arrange it
from somewhere.

89
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:39,003
l'll just be back, darling.

90
00:07:47,347 --> 00:07:49,008
No matter what you say, darling.

91
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:53,178
A wife's love is always special.
lt gives lots of tickling.

92
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:55,551
Mother's love is also very nice.

93
00:07:55,622 --> 00:07:59,183
But too much love creates
a problem sometime.

94
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:01,187
Too much love, you see.

95
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:05,096
Now when we'll reach home
you just see. How she'll..

96
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:08,100
..welcome you. She'll be
ready in your service..

97
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:12,036
..all the time. And will
look after all your need.

98
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:16,041
But she doesn't know nowadays..

99
00:08:16,109 --> 00:08:18,373
..daughters in law doesn't
like all this.

100
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:22,204
Kamini! My mother is very sweet.
You just touch her..

101
00:08:22,282 --> 00:08:25,581
..feet when you reach home.
Just impress her. But..

102
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:31,113
Do you know how to touch the feet?

103
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:34,550
This is the problem with
the modern girl like you.

104
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:37,120
Look, how l'm touching.
You just do this way.

105
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:40,055
Look!

106
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:42,567
Bend at her and tell her,
mother, bless me.

107
00:08:42,635 --> 00:08:45,126
Mummy will say. Be happy,
my daughter in law.

108
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:47,139
Live long life!

109
00:08:51,544 --> 00:08:53,068
What are you doing, Kamini?

110
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,080
Why are you driving
the jeep on me?

111
00:08:56,482 --> 00:09:00,578
No, Kamini! No. No..

112
00:09:19,572 --> 00:09:25,602
Ravi! Ravi! No.. No..
this is not possible.

113
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:30,648
Such a big injustice is not
possible. You can't leave.

114
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:35,212
You had promised me
that you'd come back.

115
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:40,555
But not this way.. brother!
Brother!

116
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:49,559
My only one young son.
My pearl. No..

117
00:09:49,636 --> 00:09:55,074
l won't let you go.
l'll come with you.

118
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:58,133
Your mother will come with you.
- Brother!

119
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:01,137
Your mother will come with you.

120
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:07,415
Leave me.. leave me.. leave me.

121
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,250
l want to go with him.

122
00:10:12,258 --> 00:10:15,250
l want to ask her.
To this mother..

123
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:17,592
..who has snatched away
my young son from me.

124
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:23,158
You didn't felt anything
watching him dying?

125
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:28,265
lf you're a mother then
l'm also a mother.

126
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:32,038
l'll see how you don't
return me my son.

127
00:10:32,111 --> 00:10:34,545
You must return me my son.

128
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:38,650
Ravi will have to come here.
At this place. ln this house.

129
00:10:38,718 --> 00:10:42,654
To me. He will have to
fulfil his promise.

130
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:46,381
He will have to pay off
his mother's debt.

131
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:49,058
He must pay off his mother's debt.

132
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:05,575
Brahma! Vishnu! Mahesh! They
came to this world so..

133
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:08,079
..many times. They
took many births.

134
00:11:08,147 --> 00:11:11,139
They came in so many forms. lt
says that if a man's wish..

135
00:11:11,217 --> 00:11:14,152
..remains incomplete before
his death or if he misses..

136
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,419
..somebody. His wish surely gets
fulfilled in the next birth.

137
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:22,087
Our friend Mr. Ravi
Verma's story..

138
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:24,095
..is also somewhat
similar to this.

139
00:11:24,163 --> 00:11:26,597
Who took rebirth for his mother.

140
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:30,536
At some other place.
ln some other form.

141
00:11:31,371 --> 00:11:33,202
With the name.. Monty.

142
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:30,085
1 .. 2.. 3..

143
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:40,198
7.. 8.. 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,206

Money.. how's this money?

146
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:47,546
Nothing can be compared
to this money.

147
00:12:47,613 --> 00:12:52,550
lf it's with you it's a problem..
And if not, is also a problem..

Yes, a problem.. Yes,

00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:58,051
Money.. this money..

151
00:12:58,124 --> 00:12:59,182
Money.. how's this money?

152
00:12:59,258 --> 00:13:03,058
Nothing can be compared
to this money.

153
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:07,395
lf it's with you it's a problem..
And if not, is also a problem..

154
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:09,059
Yes, a problem.. Yes,

155
00:13:09,135 --> 00:13:10,193

00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:18,576

160
00:13:18,644 --> 00:13:20,407
6.. - And if not, is
also a problem..

161
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,141

162
00:13:22,215 --> 00:13:24,080
7.. 8.. 9.. 10..

163
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:09,390
Saw a love. Saw the affection.

164
00:14:09,462 --> 00:14:13,125
Saw a friendship. Saw a friend.

165
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,396
Saw a love. Saw the affection.

166
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:19,563
Saw a friendship. Saw a friend.

167
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:26,567
Saw across the heart.
Saw the entire world.

168
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:30,071
Above and below. ln and
out. Far and near..

Just a minute, please.
Stop pushing!

197
00:16:54,593 --> 00:16:58,029
Please.
- On this too. - Just a minute.

198
00:16:58,097 --> 00:17:01,032
This is a railway ticket,
sir. Have a look at it.

199
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:07,039
Oh! Dayal!
- Thank God that you recognised..

200
00:17:07,106 --> 00:17:11,543
..your old friend.
- Hi!

201
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:15,374
lt was a great day today. Bigger
than the biggest thing.

202
00:17:15,448 --> 00:17:18,542
After all who made him?
l'm the maker.

203
00:17:18,617 --> 00:17:21,051
Who made Monty a star?
- You.

204
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,214
Mr. G. G. Oberoi.
- Thank you.

205
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:28,389
Sir, Mr. Ratanwala has
offered 50000 rupees..

206
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:31,157
..if Monty will sing in
his daughter's marriage.

207
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,496
What's this? Monty never sings
in the private parties.

208
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:38,002
This is my strict
contract with him.

209
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:40,504
l can't loose the millions
for thousands.

210
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:43,007
Sir, but..
- No ifs and buts.

211
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:48,002
l'm the maker. lf Monty
will sing there..

212
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,481
..he'll have to pay fine in lacs.

213
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,075
And will have to see off
his career permanently.

214
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:56,519
l completed the doctor's
course in Delhi..

215
00:17:56,589 --> 00:17:58,523
..and came to Mumbai's
hospitals for job.

216
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:01,618
Here l came to know
about your show.

217
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:04,094
So l came here. But l
was afraid whether..

218
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:06,028
..you'll recognise me or not,
after so many years?

219
00:18:06,098 --> 00:18:08,191
Now you stop your prating
and come home with me.

220
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:10,360
Joseph, is mummy at home?

221
00:18:11,504 --> 00:18:14,530
Tell her one of my very close
friends is coming home.

222
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:18,099
We'll have dinner together. The
food should be A-1 quality.

223
00:18:18,177 --> 00:18:19,576
Ok?
- Mummy?

224
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:21,374
You were telling me you
don't have parents.

225
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:24,038
How come this parents
aroused with money?

226
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:28,519
You know l used to sing in the
trains like an orphan beggar.

227
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:32,056
God had gifted me the voice.
And also sent an angle to..

228
00:18:32,124 --> 00:18:34,388
..make that voice reach
to millions of people.

229
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,554
Angle?
- Yes. He's a rich businessman

230
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,121
Mr. G. G. Oberoi.
l live with them..

231
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:42,064
..and consider them my parents.

232
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:44,067
You just come home.

233
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,064
You'll come to know
how fortunate l'm.

234
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:51,075
l'm the maker. Star maker Oberoi.

235
00:18:52,144 --> 00:18:55,580
But Mr. Oberoi. You've also
made business from this.

236
00:18:55,648 --> 00:18:59,084
So what? But who's the maker?
l'm the maker.

237
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:01,244
Here comes Monty. Ask him.

238
00:19:03,689 --> 00:19:06,089
Daddy! He's my friend. Dr. Dayal.

239
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,596
Daddy! - lf an orphan child is
calling me daddy with love..

240
00:19:11,664 --> 00:19:13,097
..what's wrong in that?

241
00:19:13,165 --> 00:19:16,157
Monty, they are my friends.
They have come from London.

242
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:18,260
Will you keep on talking
here or leave now?

243
00:19:18,771 --> 00:19:21,262
Look at the time. Monty, we're
going out for a dinner..

244
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,104
..with Mr. Pereira.
- Yes, let's go.

245
00:19:31,116 --> 00:19:34,381
Actually, my daddy is always
occupied in his business.

246
00:19:35,721 --> 00:19:39,384
l'm for the millions of people..
but nobody is mine.

247
00:19:41,227 --> 00:19:44,128
Wealth and prosperity. God
has given me everything.

248
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:54,129
But l just hear about motherly
love, l feel it and get upset.

249
00:19:56,141 --> 00:19:59,133
l don't know why but l
always miss a mother.

250
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,243
lf l had a mother, l would have
loved her so much that..

251
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:09,416
Monty! You're such a big
star and you're crying?

252
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:13,149
Look, l can't fill your lacking.

253
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,151
But you can do one job of mine.
- What?

254
00:20:17,229 --> 00:20:19,595
You know my boss, Dr. Daniel?

255
00:20:19,665 --> 00:20:21,599
There's a party at his place.
You must come there.

256
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:25,093
For what? - You're such a big
star. lf you'll come it'll make..

257
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,604
..my impression. lt's
a question of my job.

258
00:20:29,174 --> 00:20:31,369
Ok, l'll come.
- Sure? - But where?

259
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:34,042
10, Mad island road. At 6:30.

260
00:20:35,114 --> 00:20:37,207
lt seems you're new in Bombay.

261
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,050
But my friend had given
me 6:30's time.

262
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:43,111
Right? But can any rich
people's party..

263
00:20:43,188 --> 00:20:45,554
..begin before 9 or 9:30?

264
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:50,219
Dr. Daniel is staying here only?

265
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:53,231
Yes. But he's sleeping upstairs.

266
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:56,598
He won't come down
before 8:30 or 9.

267
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,561
Shall l bring something?
- No, thank you.

268
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,074
Can l go there near the piano?

269
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:05,567
Yes, sure. Please come..

270
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:11,239
Joseph! - Yes. - Did you clean
up the glasses or not?

271
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:14,684
Tina is doing it. - She's very
much involved in the work.

272
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,061
What are you looking at, my dear?

273
00:22:00,132 --> 00:22:02,123
l'm seeing how this instrument
is playing..

274
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:04,066
..and how he's playing it?

275
00:22:05,237 --> 00:22:07,068
C'mon, let's do our job. C'mon.

276
00:22:28,761 --> 00:22:30,092
Listen!

277
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:38,032
Please bring a glass
of water for me.

278
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:44,574
l'm telling you.
- Aye! My name is not this.

279
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:47,111
Joseph, give him a glass of water.

280
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:49,204
Throw?
- No. Go to hell.

281
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:23,077
These flowers are very
nice, isn't it?

282
00:23:26,151 --> 00:23:28,085
lt seems these are rose
flowers, right?

283
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:35,183
Or it might be a marigold.

284
00:23:36,095 --> 00:23:42,500
You also don't know.
- l know. lt's artificial.

285
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:46,037
There are flowers here
and a bloody fool too.

286
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:55,103
We want song! We want Monty.

287
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,206
We wont Monty.
- Silence. Silence.

288
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:02,209
We wont Monty. You have to sing..
you have to sing.

289
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:04,050
You have to sing. C'mon.

290
00:24:04,123 --> 00:24:07,388
You please listen to me. Why
don't you listen to me?

291
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:09,222
According to Mr. Oberoi's
agreement..

292
00:24:09,294 --> 00:24:12,127
..Monty never sings in
any private parties.

293
00:24:12,197 --> 00:24:15,064
lf he'll sing. He'll have
to pay fine in millions.

294
00:24:15,134 --> 00:24:17,534
And will also ruin his
career. Am l right?

295
00:24:17,603 --> 00:24:19,571
Absolutely. Please try and
understand me. Please.

296
00:24:19,638 --> 00:24:23,574
Look, l've called all my friends
for you. Now you must sing.

297
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:25,473
Papa, please tell him.

298
00:24:25,544 --> 00:24:28,138
Look, Mr. Oberoi is my friend.
l've also invited him in..

299
00:24:28,213 --> 00:24:31,512
..this party. lf you
say l'll call him up.

300
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:34,518
No, uncle, please. Don't make
me emotional. Please.

301
00:24:34,586 --> 00:24:38,078
l'm helpless.
- No.. only one line please.

302
00:24:38,557 --> 00:24:41,526
Look, l've called so many
musicians for you.

303
00:24:41,593 --> 00:24:45,085
Why don't you understand?
Monty is a star.

304
00:24:45,497 --> 00:24:49,092
He's a star. And he's also
my friend, sir. - Dayal!

305
00:24:49,168 --> 00:24:51,033
Dr. Dayal!

306
00:24:52,104 --> 00:24:55,540
For the same of Dr. Daniel
and for Dr. Dayal..

307
00:24:55,607 --> 00:24:59,099
..if you say l can play
some musical instrument.

308
00:24:59,178 --> 00:25:01,043
Yes.. let's do that.

309
00:25:59,104 --> 00:26:02,540
Stinging in a heart..

310
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:07,205

Shall l sing?

Your fascinating eyes

Your fascinating eyes

326
00:28:06,098 --> 00:28:16,099
This stanza is not mine..

You've generated in my heart.

334
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:44,061
When and where everybody
has disappeared?

335
00:29:44,129 --> 00:29:49,123
Where all the shadows have lost?

336
00:29:49,668 --> 00:29:54,571
Friends party has gone over..

337
00:29:54,639 --> 00:29:59,076
The privacy is left for us.

338
00:29:59,144 --> 00:30:02,580
When and where everybody
has disappeared?

339
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:07,584
Where all the shadows have lost?

340
00:30:07,652 --> 00:30:13,090
Friends party has gone over..

341
00:30:13,158 --> 00:30:17,254
The privacy is left for us.

342
00:30:17,696 --> 00:30:22,099
What did you do?

343
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:26,604
Perhaps you've made
some curtain fall.

344
00:30:26,671 --> 00:30:28,696
Stinging in a heart..

345
00:30:28,773 --> 00:30:31,640
Throbbing in a heart..

346
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:36,647
You've generated in my heart.

347
00:30:36,715 --> 00:30:38,046
Stinging in a heart..

348
00:30:38,116 --> 00:30:40,641
Throbbing in a heart..

349
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:46,123
You've generated in my heart.

350
00:31:06,545 --> 00:31:08,069
Please sing..

351
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:37,205
Within a short time..
We'll get separated.

352
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:46,110
Within a short time..
We'll get separated.

353
00:31:46,651 --> 00:31:55,389
How will l search for you..
all the paths will be lost.

354
00:31:55,727 --> 00:32:04,226
You've not even tell
me your name..

355
00:32:04,302 --> 00:32:07,066
Stinging in a heart..

356
00:32:07,138 --> 00:32:09,402
Throbbing in a heart..

357
00:32:09,474 --> 00:32:13,570
You've generated in my heart.

358
00:32:14,145 --> 00:32:23,076
l was just a poet before..
you've made me your fan.

359
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:25,580
Stinging in a heart..

360
00:32:25,657 --> 00:32:27,591
Throbbing in a heart..

361
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,095
You've generated in my heart.

362
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,108
Stinging in a heart..

363
00:32:44,175 --> 00:32:46,109
Throbbing in a heart..

364
00:32:46,177 --> 00:32:50,204
You've generated in my heart.

365
00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:53,117
Stinging in a heart..

366
00:32:53,184 --> 00:32:55,448
Throbbing in a heart..

367
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,547
You've generated in my heart.

368
00:33:29,154 --> 00:33:32,021
l must say.. all the
big personalities..

369
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:34,354
..accepted defeat
to make you sing.

370
00:33:34,426 --> 00:33:36,087
But just one girls eyes made..

371
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:38,356
..your voice and stanzas come out.

372
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,022
What a radioactivity.

373
00:33:41,366 --> 00:33:44,529
But this radioactivity has really
worsened my situation.

374
00:33:45,203 --> 00:33:47,535
l had fixed radar
and keeping watch.

375
00:33:47,605 --> 00:33:49,095
A moon came. lt spread
the moonlight.

376
00:33:49,174 --> 00:33:51,039
And she disappeared.

377
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,535
Who's she? From where
she has come.

378
00:33:54,612 --> 00:33:56,512
Try and find out something
about her.

379
00:33:56,581 --> 00:33:59,209
She came from the kitchen
and went back to it.

380
00:33:59,651 --> 00:34:01,642
That means her menu card will
be found in the kitchen.

381
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,051
l'll get the information soon.

382
00:34:03,521 --> 00:34:06,581
Listen! - What's the matter?
- Be careful. You're drunk.

383
00:34:09,394 --> 00:34:13,057
Hi Monty! Can we sit here?
- Yes sure. - Thank you.

384
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:15,065
Meet them. They are my friends.

385
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:16,566
Hello, everybody. Thank you.

386
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:18,568
You've really sung
a nice song today.

387
00:34:18,636 --> 00:34:21,070
l'm a big fan of yours.

388
00:34:23,575 --> 00:34:26,135
Now what are you doing?
- l'm waiting for my friend.

389
00:34:26,611 --> 00:34:28,408
We attend all your programs.

390
00:34:40,091 --> 00:34:42,025
Not at all.

391
00:34:51,202 --> 00:34:54,535
What? - Excuse me, please.
Private talking. Just a minute.

392
00:34:54,606 --> 00:34:57,200
Excuse me!
- You please forget that girl.

393
00:34:57,275 --> 00:35:00,039
She's not a servant
and not even a queen.

394
00:35:00,111 --> 00:35:03,706
She had come to see
Mumbai from Ooty..

395
00:35:03,782 --> 00:35:06,046
..in her school tour.
- Had come? - Had come.

396
00:35:06,117 --> 00:35:10,053
The cook Francis here
is from her village.

397
00:35:10,121 --> 00:35:13,113
He went to meet her. And got
her here for few hours..

398
00:35:13,191 --> 00:35:16,058
..to show her a grand
party of Mumbai.

399
00:35:16,127 --> 00:35:18,652
Now she's going back tonight
by 1 1 :30's train.

400
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,221
By now she might have left.

401
00:35:21,566 --> 00:35:25,127
So you please forget
her considering it..

402
00:35:25,203 --> 00:35:28,138
..a beautiful dream sequence
and eat this chicken.

403
00:35:28,206 --> 00:35:32,165
You can't insult me like this.
- l didn't insult you, daddy.

404
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:34,177
Don't call me daddy.

405
00:35:34,245 --> 00:35:36,008
Remember, you're not my son.

406
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,516
You're an employee under
contract. A stage contract.

407
00:35:39,584 --> 00:35:41,518
My money.. my name..
- Money.. and money..

408
00:35:41,586 --> 00:35:44,020
You need money not me.

409
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,082
lt might not happen that because
of your too much..

410
00:35:47,158 --> 00:35:49,092
..restrictions and hatred Monty
will leave your money and..

411
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,094
..stage contract and go
to some other world.

412
00:35:53,198 --> 00:35:55,029
What happened?

413
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:58,626
lt's a question of money.
l didn't do anything.

414
00:35:58,703 --> 00:36:00,500
You convince him. Little lovingly.

415
00:36:09,214 --> 00:36:12,377
Hello!
- Hello, Julie! - l see.

416
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:15,544
So Mr. Monty is hiding
here from his fans.

417
00:36:17,388 --> 00:36:21,119
l'm trying to write a song from
last four days for my fans..

418
00:36:21,192 --> 00:36:23,057
..but l'm not getting
the proper words.

419
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:26,062
But that day you made
our party remarkable.

420
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,064
What a song you've sung!

421
00:36:28,132 --> 00:36:30,157
Look at the photographs
of that party.

422
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:37,005
Look at it. All my friends
were praising you so much.

423
00:36:37,675 --> 00:36:40,075
They were telling me Julie, if
you weren't inspired Monty..

424
00:36:40,144 --> 00:36:42,510
..he might not have sung
such a beautiful song.

425
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,070
After all to sing a song
and to write it..

426
00:36:44,148 --> 00:36:46,514
..one needs some sort
of inspiration.

427
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:49,018
You were right, Ms. Julie.

428
00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:54,354
You can say l've got
my inspiration.

429
00:37:52,517 --> 00:37:56,009
Have you ever loved anybody?
- Yes.

430
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:58,612
Have you ever gone crazy
after anybody? - Yes.

431
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:01,090
l had also gone crazy.

432
00:38:32,056 --> 00:38:36,220
The youths of my age..

433
00:38:40,231 --> 00:38:44,224
Do not fall in love
with anybody.

434
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:52,235
The youths of my age..

435
00:38:52,577 --> 00:38:56,138
Do not fall in love
with anybody.

436
00:38:56,214 --> 00:39:03,143
l have lost my ease and sleep
by falling in love.

437
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:10,151
People never lie..

438
00:39:10,228 --> 00:39:19,432
..that no disease is
dangerous than love.

439
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:24,602
We loose all the control on our
heart after falling in love.

440
00:39:24,676 --> 00:39:28,442
We loose all the control on our
heart after falling in love.

441
00:39:28,513 --> 00:39:32,643
There's no treatment to this
diseases in the world.

442
00:39:32,717 --> 00:39:41,125
Then sing.. Ohm! Shanti Ohm.

443
00:39:41,192 --> 00:39:45,219
Shanti, Shanti ohm!

444
00:39:45,296 --> 00:39:53,567
Ohm! Shanti ohm. Shanti,

445
00:39:57,408 --> 00:40:09,252
Ohm! Shanti ohm. Shanti,

446
00:40:10,154 --> 00:40:16,582
Ohm! Shanti ohm. Shanti,
Shanti ohm!

447
00:40:47,391 --> 00:40:51,122
Look at me.. l've spoiled
my nights..

448
00:40:51,195 --> 00:40:55,131
..by offering my
heart to somebody.

449
00:40:55,733 --> 00:40:59,066
Look at me.. l've spoiled
my nights..

450
00:40:59,137 --> 00:41:03,073
..by offering my
heart to somebody.

451
00:41:04,142 --> 00:41:08,135
l've still not received..

452
00:41:08,212 --> 00:41:14,583
l've still not received any
answer from that side.

453
00:41:15,419 --> 00:41:19,082
lf she'll refuse l won't
hesitate to commit suicide.

454
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:23,151
lf she'll refuse l won't
hesitate to commit suicide.

455
00:41:23,561 --> 00:41:27,258
lf she'll accept then too
l'll die with a bliss.

456
00:41:27,331 --> 00:41:35,534
Then sing.. Ohm! Shanti Ohm.

457
00:41:35,606 --> 00:41:40,202
Shanti, Shanti ohm!

458
00:41:40,278 --> 00:41:47,207
Ohm! Shanti ohm. Shanti,
Shanti ohm!

459
00:42:49,213 --> 00:42:57,382
One who has hidden just by
giving a glance of her.

460
00:42:58,122 --> 00:43:05,551
One who has hidden just by
giving a glance of her.

461
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:13,568
Now l take each of my
breath with her name..

462
00:43:14,405 --> 00:43:17,568
With her name..

463
00:43:17,642 --> 00:43:21,134
l have millions of fans
but now l'm her fan.

464
00:43:21,212 --> 00:43:25,148
l have millions of fans
but now l'm her fan.

465
00:43:25,216 --> 00:43:27,582
lf you come across
such situation..

466
00:43:27,652 --> 00:43:29,415
..in love then sing
this song. Sing..

467
00:43:29,487 --> 00:43:37,519
Then sing.. Ohm! Shanti Ohm.

468
00:43:37,595 --> 00:43:42,089
Shanti, Shanti ohm!

469
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:49,538
Ohm! Shanti ohm. Shanti,

470
00:43:54,545 --> 00:44:06,389
Ohm! Shanti ohm. Shanti,

00:44:06,457 --> 00:44:13,556
Ohm! Shanti ohm. Shanti,

00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:28,576
Ohm! Shanti ohm. Shanti,

473
00:44:28,646 --> 00:44:34,516

00:44:55,606 --> 00:45:07,575

480
00:45:20,231 --> 00:45:24,133
We want.. Monty!

481
00:45:24,201 --> 00:45:28,137
We want.. Monty!

482
00:45:28,205 --> 00:45:32,164
We want.. Monty!

483
00:45:32,243 --> 00:45:37,180
We want.. Monty!

484
00:45:37,248 --> 00:45:42,185
We want.. Monty!

485
00:45:42,253 --> 00:45:47,520
We want.. Monty!

486
00:47:56,554 --> 00:47:59,523
Yes! Yes, Monty.

487
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:02,024
Try to remember.. Try to remember
do you know that..

488
00:48:02,092 --> 00:48:04,526
..woman who was driving the jeep?
- No.

489
00:48:05,196 --> 00:48:08,188
That boy whom she was murdering?
- Not at all.

490
00:48:08,265 --> 00:48:12,201
You might have seen such
incidence in a film? - Never.

491
00:48:12,269 --> 00:48:15,204
Somebody might have told
you such story? - No.

492
00:48:15,272 --> 00:48:18,571
Any book, any novel?
- Not even in my dream.

493
00:48:18,642 --> 00:48:20,041
Then how these images emerged..

494
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:22,044
..in your mind and when?

495
00:48:22,112 --> 00:48:24,046
Yesterday night when l was..

496
00:48:24,114 --> 00:48:26,048
..playing the high
nodes of guitar.

497
00:48:27,051 --> 00:48:29,383
Sister, give him the guitar.

498
00:48:30,554 --> 00:48:33,546
Close your eyes and
play that tune again.

499
00:49:22,172 --> 00:49:26,438
No.. no, doctor, this time l've
also seen something else.

500
00:49:28,178 --> 00:49:30,112
A small valley.

501
00:49:30,514 --> 00:49:34,041
Goddess Kali's temple.
There's one palace.

502
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:41,115
And also a pond. But she was
the same girl and same boy.

503
00:49:43,527 --> 00:49:47,588
Dr. Daniel, when this
is not concern with..

504
00:49:47,665 --> 00:49:49,064
..his past life or with any shock.

505
00:49:49,133 --> 00:49:53,570
lsn't it possible that this
must be his last births..

506
00:49:53,637 --> 00:49:56,663
Last birth? - Yes. - What
nonsense, Dr. Shashtri?

507
00:49:57,241 --> 00:49:59,141
You're talking about
reincarnation..

508
00:49:59,209 --> 00:50:01,404
..and rebirth in this
modern times?

509
00:50:04,081 --> 00:50:07,414
Dr. Shashtri, finally
you've proved yourself.

510
00:50:08,419 --> 00:50:10,580
You may not believe this.

511
00:50:11,555 --> 00:50:16,254
A 5 years old child in south
lndia could speak the entire..

512
00:50:16,327 --> 00:50:18,261
..Geeta and Ramayana in Sanskrit.

513
00:50:19,096 --> 00:50:21,587
And he had described
his last birth's..

514
00:50:21,665 --> 00:50:23,098
..parents and village in detail.

515
00:50:24,268 --> 00:50:26,566
ln the beginning people
laughed at him..

516
00:50:26,637 --> 00:50:29,105
..but when this was proved true.
People considered it..

517
00:50:29,173 --> 00:50:31,368
..a miracle of God and kept quiet.

518
00:50:32,376 --> 00:50:37,211
Dr. Shashtri, let go off this. l
think it's a case of psychosis.

519
00:50:38,115 --> 00:50:40,049
Let's go and discuss the rest
in the consulting room.

520
00:50:40,117 --> 00:50:41,175
C'mon.

521
00:50:41,251 --> 00:50:44,743
According to me. Monty
needs to take..

522
00:50:44,822 --> 00:50:48,553
..complete one months rest.
And he shouldn't play that..

523
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:50,650
..special tune till we don't
reach to any conclusion.

524
00:50:50,728 --> 00:50:53,060
Doctor, if Monty will
take on months break..

525
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:55,064
..we'll suffer loss in millions.

526
00:50:55,132 --> 00:50:57,066
Then do you wish him to
finish off permanently?

527
00:50:57,134 --> 00:51:02,572
Monty, according to me you must
go to some hill-station.

528
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:05,574
For example, Kashmir,
Darjeeling, Ooty.

529
00:51:05,642 --> 00:51:11,080
No, doctor. No hill station
can relax me without music.

530
00:51:11,148 --> 00:51:14,083
There's one hill station
that can soothe him.

531
00:51:14,151 --> 00:51:17,143
And that is Ooty.
- Ooty? - Yes, sir.

532
00:51:17,221 --> 00:51:20,418
That song of him.. stinging
heart.. throbbing heart.

533
00:51:20,491 --> 00:51:23,085
lt's super hit over there.
lt's played there daily.

534
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,094
Ooty! The beauty!

535
00:51:27,264 --> 00:51:30,529
Yes, doctor! l would like to
go Ooty. l'll go to Ooty.

536
00:51:34,505 --> 00:51:37,099
Stinging in a heart..

537
00:51:37,174 --> 00:51:40,371
Throbbing in a heart..

538
00:51:40,444 --> 00:51:45,541
You've generated in my heart.

539
00:51:45,616 --> 00:51:47,208
Wow! Wow!

540
00:51:49,052 --> 00:52:01,055
l was just a poet before..
you've made me your fan.

541
00:52:01,565 --> 00:52:04,227
Then what happened?
- Then?

542
00:52:04,301 --> 00:52:07,236
Then he became my fan.
- Really?

543
00:52:07,304 --> 00:52:09,067
Do you think l'm lying?

544
00:52:09,139 --> 00:52:12,131
You all are his fan.
But he became my fan.

545
00:52:12,209 --> 00:52:18,239
l made him crazy. He was staring
at me and singing.

546
00:52:18,315 --> 00:52:20,078
What he was singing?

547
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:22,584
What he said.. it was very nice.

548
00:52:22,653 --> 00:52:25,417
We'll get separated..
what was it?

549
00:52:25,489 --> 00:52:33,521
Within a short time..
We'll get separated.

550
00:52:34,631 --> 00:52:43,039
Within a short time..
We'll get separated.

551
00:52:44,174 --> 00:52:51,546
How will l search for you..
all the paths will be lost.

552
00:52:53,116 --> 00:53:01,387
You've not even tell
me your name..

553
00:53:01,725 --> 00:53:03,215
Stinging in a heart..

554
00:53:03,293 --> 00:53:05,557
Throbbing in a heart..

555
00:53:05,629 --> 00:53:11,067
You've generated in my heart.

556
00:53:21,745 --> 00:53:23,576
Tina, what's the matter?

557
00:53:23,647 --> 00:53:26,582
You're sitting in the
library till 6:30?

558
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:29,414
He had called me in the college
restaurant at 6 o'clock.

559
00:53:29,486 --> 00:53:31,351
You didn't go there?
- No.

560
00:53:31,421 --> 00:53:37,018
Rita, l'll swear by God! my heart
is beating very heavily.

561
00:53:37,628 --> 00:53:40,426
l just can't think of anything.
l can't decide.

562
00:53:40,497 --> 00:53:43,523
l'm totally blank you know.
- This is the sound of his love.

563
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,364
But l didn't go to meet him.
- This is the sound of your love.

564
00:53:46,436 --> 00:53:47,494
What nonsense?

565
00:53:47,571 --> 00:53:51,564
My dear, this is such storm
that nobody can stop.

566
00:53:51,642 --> 00:53:54,543
More you try to stop, more
it'll blow with force.

567
00:53:54,611 --> 00:53:56,101
lf it's blowing ahead. Let it go.

568
00:53:56,179 --> 00:53:58,113
lf it's coming to you.
Let it come.

569
00:54:52,202 --> 00:54:54,363
Look at him. He's staring at me.

570
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,631
He's just staring at you.
He's not touching you.

571
00:54:59,376 --> 00:55:01,537
Shall l ask you something?
- What?

572
00:55:01,612 --> 00:55:05,104
You know my friend Rita?
She was telling me that..

573
00:55:05,182 --> 00:55:07,377
..city boys are like the wasp.

574
00:55:07,451 --> 00:55:10,215
They roam around the
flowers and escape.

575
00:55:10,721 --> 00:55:16,387
Meaning? - lt means first they
sing songs then falls in love.

576
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:20,396
And slowly they take away
the girls in the hotel.

577
00:55:20,464 --> 00:55:22,056
Then..
- Then?

578
00:55:22,666 --> 00:55:25,226
l hope you won't do that with me?
- What are you saying?

579
00:55:26,136 --> 00:55:28,661
No. Actually, Rita was telling
me that you should..

580
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:30,604
..be careful from the
boys before marriage.

581
00:55:30,674 --> 00:55:32,005
What do you mean by careful?

582
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:38,010
You're very innocent, Tina.

583
00:55:38,081 --> 00:55:41,016
l'll marry you first and then..
- No.

584
00:55:41,084 --> 00:55:43,348
Not even after that. Let
Kabir uncle arrive first.

585
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:47,356
Kabir uncle? - Yes. He's the only
one for me in this world.

586
00:55:47,424 --> 00:55:50,018
He's at abroad from
last so many years.

587
00:55:50,093 --> 00:55:52,357
He has left me here under
the care taking of queen.

588
00:55:52,429 --> 00:55:55,694
He had sent a note that he'll
come anytime in these days.

589
00:55:55,766 --> 00:55:57,358
And he'll surprise me.

590
00:55:59,036 --> 00:56:05,100
Not bad. After 10 years Kabira
is released from the jail.

591
00:56:05,175 --> 00:56:07,040
But l can't see any change here.

592
00:56:07,577 --> 00:56:10,569
There's one change, Sir. You've
made impact after..

593
00:56:10,647 --> 00:56:14,208
..going to the jail. You're
the talk of the town.

594
00:56:14,284 --> 00:56:17,048
There's a benefit after
going to the jail.

595
00:56:17,554 --> 00:56:19,545
Where is the queen nowadays?

596
00:56:19,623 --> 00:56:21,215
She has gone for the foreign tour.

597
00:56:21,591 --> 00:56:24,560
And my sweet daughter Tina?

598
00:56:24,628 --> 00:56:26,653
She's studying very sincerely.

599
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:30,063
And we're taking her monthly
expense from queen.

600
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:35,532
l also have spent 10 years
in jail because of queen.

601
00:56:35,605 --> 00:56:38,005
But there's one problem, sir.
- What?

602
00:56:38,075 --> 00:56:41,010
Raxi has betrayed us.
You had given him..

603
00:56:41,078 --> 00:56:45,515
..your house in his bad times.
He has captured it legally.

604
00:56:45,582 --> 00:56:47,607
And he has made it a beer bar.

605
00:56:49,686 --> 00:56:53,178
l offered everything
for the friendship.

606
00:56:54,491 --> 00:56:57,016
Are you betraying your friend?

607
00:56:57,094 --> 00:56:59,187
Now see this Kabira has come.

608
00:56:59,262 --> 00:57:01,025
l don't know you.

609
00:57:01,565 --> 00:57:05,092
ln this generation
people forgets..

610
00:57:05,168 --> 00:57:07,102
..others obligation in few days.

611
00:57:08,171 --> 00:57:10,366
Whereas this is a matter of 10
years before. lt's too old.

612
00:57:10,707 --> 00:57:15,110
Such a long duration can
weaken a debtor's memory.

613
00:57:16,379 --> 00:57:19,041
However let me remind
you about me.

614
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:23,576
This orphan took birth
in streets..

615
00:57:24,221 --> 00:57:27,054
One kind Musalman found
me in a basket.

616
00:57:27,124 --> 00:57:30,321
And l don't know why
he named me Kabir.

617
00:57:31,595 --> 00:57:34,120
Kabira! brought up
at Muslim family.

618
00:57:34,197 --> 00:57:35,994
Had friendship with Hindus..

619
00:57:36,066 --> 00:57:38,000
..and speech was like Britishers.

620
00:57:39,069 --> 00:57:44,063
But l'm not that Kabir. Who
is the real man and saint.

621
00:57:44,141 --> 00:57:47,008
l'm Kabir 'Badshah'.
l'm grateful to God.

622
00:57:47,077 --> 00:57:51,070
And devil for a wildly
person like you.

623
00:57:52,082 --> 00:57:55,518
When l had given you my house.

624
00:57:55,585 --> 00:57:57,519
You considered me your friend.

625
00:57:57,587 --> 00:58:01,523
And today when l've come to
ask for my house back.

626
00:58:01,591 --> 00:58:04,082
You've started taking
me as your enemy?

627
00:58:04,161 --> 00:58:08,530
Kabir, you better go and ask
this question to the law.

628
00:58:09,166 --> 00:58:12,101
Now Roxi owns this place.

629
00:58:12,636 --> 00:58:16,538
Those who do not listen to the
saints repent for years..

630
00:58:16,606 --> 00:58:20,542
Have the kicks from all the
paths he passes through..

631
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:23,044
Wow! Kabira! Wow!
- Kabira!

632
00:58:23,513 --> 00:58:25,378
Are you trying to give me threats?

633
00:58:25,448 --> 00:58:27,040
Do not talk.

634
00:58:27,117 --> 00:58:30,553
Scared people give the
threat and challenges.

635
00:58:32,055 --> 00:58:35,115
l'll come tomorrow morning at
6:30 to get back my house.

636
00:58:36,193 --> 00:58:38,388
You better arrange for
yourself before that.

637
00:58:38,728 --> 00:58:40,559
C'mon, right. C'mon, left.

638
00:58:41,131 --> 00:58:43,065
He has clearly given us a threat.

639
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:50,062
Bikhu, you gather your men
and reach here before 6:30.

640
00:58:50,607 --> 00:58:55,567
l'll ruin this Kabir otherwise
l won't call myself Roxi.

641
00:59:03,553 --> 00:59:05,578
Police?
- That means Roxi..

642
00:59:05,655 --> 00:59:08,089
..has taken help from the police.

643
00:59:08,558 --> 00:59:10,423
Then why did he call us
in the early morning?

644
00:59:10,493 --> 00:59:12,256
He might have got
scared of Kabira.

645
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:18,600
Police is coming towards
us. C'mon, Jaggu.

646
00:59:24,774 --> 00:59:28,437
Did you see? This is this
uniform's miracle.

647
00:59:29,446 --> 00:59:32,540
And Kabira is creating
a commotion there.

648
00:59:35,552 --> 00:59:37,713
l'm very much punctual of time.

649
00:59:37,787 --> 00:59:39,550
Do not develop enmity with me.

650
00:59:39,623 --> 00:59:42,057
Now that Kabira has come,
you better save yourself.

651
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:44,059
Kabira!

652
00:59:55,405 --> 00:59:57,134
Enough, Kabira! Stop it!

653
00:59:57,207 --> 00:59:59,607
l'll send this bottles
to Roxi's house.

654
00:59:59,676 --> 01:00:01,143
Don't beat him so much, Kabira.

655
01:00:01,211 --> 01:00:03,076
He'll become a barren.

656
01:00:03,146 --> 01:00:07,139
He's also from a swine's society.

657
01:00:09,686 --> 01:00:12,086
Enough, sir!
- Sir, don't say so much stanza..

658
01:00:12,155 --> 01:00:14,419
..that the sermon gets complete.

659
01:00:14,491 --> 01:00:18,086
This bastard has a family.
- He has a family?

660
01:00:18,495 --> 01:00:20,087
Who knows about this?
- We know.

661
01:00:20,697 --> 01:00:24,258
l never knew. lf he has a family..

662
01:00:24,334 --> 01:00:26,598
..then take him to the hospital.

663
01:00:27,704 --> 01:00:29,604
Left and right, l hope
you didn't say..

664
01:00:29,673 --> 01:00:31,538
..anything to Tina about me.

665
01:00:31,608 --> 01:00:34,577
We only told that God
has made your uncle..

666
01:00:34,644 --> 01:00:37,044
..Vasco-de-Gamma of lndia.

667
01:00:37,113 --> 01:00:41,106
Whom government has sent around
the world for ten years.

668
01:00:42,052 --> 01:00:45,112
l've forgot her face too.

669
01:00:45,588 --> 01:00:49,115
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!
- My daughter!

670
01:00:50,727 --> 01:00:52,058
Uncle!

671
01:00:53,129 --> 01:00:55,120
Uncle, you might have
forgotten my face..

672
01:00:55,198 --> 01:00:58,065
..but l didn't forget you. l got
all your gifts time to time.

673
01:00:58,134 --> 01:01:01,592
Everything. Also the money.
But l won't talk with you.

674
01:01:01,671 --> 01:01:03,662
l didn't get a single
letter of yours.

675
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:07,073
My child, l was taking a trip
from one country to another.

676
01:01:07,143 --> 01:01:09,077
lt was government's
responsibility.

677
01:01:09,145 --> 01:01:11,136
Now l've come. And l've
told the principal..

678
01:01:11,214 --> 01:01:13,580
..that now my daughter
will live with me.

679
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:17,586

680
01:01:19,155 --> 01:01:22,420
Uncle, now l've grown
up, haven't l?

681
01:01:22,492 --> 01:01:26,588
Grown up? My daughter has
grown up more than you.

682
01:01:26,663 --> 01:01:30,099
Gentleman, if you can
find a nice boy..

683
01:01:34,537 --> 01:01:37,028
Because l'm very much tensed
about her marriage.

684
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:40,036
Thank you.

685
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:41,577
Uncle, what do you
have in your hand?

686
01:01:41,644 --> 01:01:43,202
Nothing.. nothing, my child.

687
01:01:43,279 --> 01:01:45,042
l know. You've got gifts
for me. Right?

688
01:01:45,115 --> 01:01:48,050
No.. no..
- l know. Please show me. Please.

689
01:01:48,118 --> 01:01:51,554
C'mon, let's complete the
formalities at office.

690
01:01:51,621 --> 01:01:54,590
Yes, c'mon. - All girls of
my school have passed..

691
01:01:54,657 --> 01:01:58,388
..all have grown up. But my
daughter is still unmarried.

692
01:01:58,728 --> 01:02:00,559
ls he your uncle?
- Yes.

693
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:03,064
Show me what he has brought
for you from foreign?

694
01:02:04,401 --> 01:02:07,131
Today uncle reminded
me of my father.

695
01:02:08,571 --> 01:02:12,063
Tina, it seems your uncle
still considers you a baby.

696
01:02:12,609 --> 01:02:14,076
Here's your gift.

697
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:25,577
Why are you laughing? Uncle
thought l'm still a small kid.

698
01:02:26,222 --> 01:02:27,280
He considered you right.

699
01:02:27,357 --> 01:02:29,416
Your brain department
is still very small.

700
01:02:29,492 --> 01:02:31,517
No, now l've grown up.

701
01:02:31,594 --> 01:02:33,186
You've grown up?
- Yes.

702
01:02:34,097 --> 01:02:36,088
Let me see how much
you've grown up?

703
01:02:41,104 --> 01:02:43,038
Girl is really beautiful.

704
01:02:43,106 --> 01:02:45,574
Mister, send the girl here.

705
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:52,211
Help! Help! ls anybody over here?

706
01:03:28,685 --> 01:03:30,084
Rascals!

707
01:03:33,356 --> 01:03:36,018
l see.. so one more is still left?

708
01:03:51,641 --> 01:03:54,371
Don't worry, sister. Kabira says..

709
01:03:55,111 --> 01:03:57,045
Monty, what's this?
You stupid! ldiot!

710
01:03:57,113 --> 01:03:59,377
What are you doing? He's
my uncle! Kabir uncle!

711
01:03:59,716 --> 01:04:05,052
Kabir uncle!
- Not bad. - l'm very sorry, sir.

712
01:04:05,121 --> 01:04:07,385
l didn't know.
- Shake hands, my friend. - Yes.

713
01:04:09,225 --> 01:04:12,558
My child, you're still a student.
- Uncle!

714
01:04:13,229 --> 01:04:16,062
Do not talk. You didn't
even understand that..

715
01:04:16,132 --> 01:04:18,396
..you were not beating me.
l was getting beaten.

716
01:04:19,536 --> 01:04:22,733
Fighter's association.
Your drama is over.

717
01:04:22,805 --> 01:04:24,136
Now get lost.

718
01:04:25,241 --> 01:04:27,539
Anyway, l liked your hero.

719
01:04:28,077 --> 01:04:30,068
Only strength is not
enough for fight.

720
01:04:32,615 --> 01:04:34,344
What's your name?
- Monty.

721
01:04:34,417 --> 01:04:37,511
Occupation?
- l sing. - l also sing.

722
01:04:38,087 --> 01:04:39,145
What's your occupation?

723
01:04:39,222 --> 01:04:41,349
Uncle, he's a big
singer at Mumbai.

724
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:44,019
Do not talk. Everybody
is a singer.

725
01:04:44,093 --> 01:04:46,186
What's the arrangement
for bread and butter?

726
01:04:47,363 --> 01:04:49,024
Everything can be meet
with this singing.

727
01:04:49,098 --> 01:04:51,566
God has given me everything.
- Not bad.

728
01:04:52,202 --> 01:04:54,193
You also believe in God.
- Yes.

729
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:57,034
Do you love Tina?
- Yes.

730
01:04:58,107 --> 01:05:01,543
Do you intend to marry her or
it's company of singing only?

731
01:05:01,611 --> 01:05:03,545
No, l'm intending to make
her my life partner.

732
01:05:04,113 --> 01:05:06,047
Left and right.
- Yes, sir.

733
01:05:06,115 --> 01:05:10,381
The boy who protects the girl.
He has a permit for marriage.

734
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:15,214
Uncle! - Thank you very much,
sir. - No, sir. Call me Kabira.

735
01:05:16,059 --> 01:05:19,392
What's your age?
- l'm around 21 to 22.

736
01:05:19,462 --> 01:05:23,125
But this innocent boy
seems to be of just 1 7.

737
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:26,569
Even an old man becomes
young if fallen in love.

738
01:05:27,136 --> 01:05:29,661
A girl seems to be Shirin and
boy seems to be Farhad.

739
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:34,003
You've passed in Kabira's test.

740
01:05:34,077 --> 01:05:38,343
Now you can go and sing some
song. l mean duet song.

741
01:05:38,414 --> 01:05:42,009
A couple song.
- C'mon, Monty. Let's go fast.

742
01:05:42,685 --> 01:05:44,175
Left and right.
- Yes, sir.

743
01:05:44,254 --> 01:05:49,521
You'll keep following them.
l mean.. - Censure.

744
01:06:01,204 --> 01:06:06,198
What's your age?
- What's your age?

745
01:06:06,709 --> 01:06:12,113
l'm 16 years.
- Then l'm 1 7 years.

746
01:06:13,116 --> 01:06:16,381
16.
- 1 7. - 1 7? - 16?

747
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:24,390
We might not fall in love.
Keep away for a year or two.

748
01:06:25,228 --> 01:06:29,562
Keep away for a year or two.

749
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:34,497
Don't blame me if
anything happens.

750
01:06:35,338 --> 01:06:40,173
l'm 16 years and you're of 1 7.

751
01:06:41,077 --> 01:06:46,174
l'm 16 years and you're of 1 7.

752
01:06:46,683 --> 01:06:49,618
We might not fall in love.

753
01:06:49,686 --> 01:06:54,521
lt's very difficult to keep away.

754
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:59,522
Don't blame me if
anything happens.

755
01:06:59,595 --> 01:07:10,369
You're of 16 and l'm 1 7.
You're of 16 and l'm 1 7.

756
01:07:11,107 --> 01:07:19,037
We might not fall in love.
-Keep away for a year or two.

757
01:07:19,582 --> 01:07:24,212
Don't blame me if
anything happens.

758
01:07:46,676 --> 01:07:50,510
What happens if the heavy clouds

759
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:54,175
collides with the mountains?

760
01:07:54,484 --> 01:07:59,183
There'll be a rain.
What will happen..

761
01:07:59,255 --> 01:08:04,522
..if your heart will
meet with mine?

762
01:08:04,594 --> 01:08:08,360
There'll be a procession.

763
01:08:08,431 --> 01:08:11,366
God knows when there'll
be rain..

764
01:08:11,434 --> 01:08:14,028
..and when there'll
be a procession.

765
01:08:14,103 --> 01:08:19,200
My heart wishes tonight to
be the night of our union.

766
01:08:19,275 --> 01:08:22,039
Why? Why?
- Because..

767
01:08:22,111 --> 01:08:33,045
You're of 16 and l'm 1 7.
You're of 16 and l'm 1 7.

768
01:08:33,122 --> 01:08:41,222
We might not fall in love.
-Keep away for a year or two.

769
01:08:41,297 --> 01:08:46,234
Don't blame me if
anything happens.

770
01:09:31,113 --> 01:09:36,380
True lovers never
meet each other.

771
01:09:37,053 --> 01:09:41,217
Now l'll see when we'd meet.

772
01:09:41,657 --> 01:09:47,118
What's the hurdle in
our meeting now?

773
01:09:47,196 --> 01:09:52,065
We have the same destination.

774
01:09:52,134 --> 01:09:57,231
lt's at distance
and not so close.

775
01:09:57,306 --> 01:10:02,403
Now it's not good for
us to meet frequently.

776
01:10:02,478 --> 01:10:05,242
Why? Why?
- Because..

777
01:10:05,314 --> 01:10:10,251
l'm 16 years and you're of 1 7.

778
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:16,252
l'm 16 years and you're of 1 7.

779
01:10:16,592 --> 01:10:19,425
We might not fall in love.

780
01:10:19,495 --> 01:10:24,262
lt's very difficult
to keep away.

781
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:29,264
Don't blame me if
anything happens.

782
01:10:29,572 --> 01:10:34,566
Keep away for a year or two.

783
01:10:34,644 --> 01:10:39,547
Don't blame me if
anything happens.

784
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:44,211
l'm 16 years..
- l'm 1 7 years.

785
01:10:45,121 --> 01:10:51,060
l'm 16 years..
- l'm 1 7 years.

786
01:12:33,095 --> 01:12:36,531
This love is not so easy.
Understand this.

787
01:12:37,099 --> 01:12:38,157
lt's an ocean of fire..

788
01:12:38,234 --> 01:12:40,361
..and you must drown
and pass through it.

789
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:43,638
l had told you to sing.
But l didn't tell you..

790
01:12:43,706 --> 01:12:47,107
..to involve so much
that you get faint.

791
01:12:47,176 --> 01:12:50,543
Now go to sleep. Everything
will be fine by the morning.

792
01:12:50,613 --> 01:12:52,376
C'mon, Kabira.

793
01:13:24,547 --> 01:13:26,572
Finished! Everything finished!

794
01:13:26,649 --> 01:13:30,176
l'm old Robert. l'm
still as it is.

795
01:13:30,519 --> 01:13:33,079
Everything has changed
in these 25 years.

796
01:13:33,155 --> 01:13:35,020
Everything is finished.

797
01:13:35,091 --> 01:13:40,085
Verma factory finished.
Now Surjuda factory.

798
01:13:40,162 --> 01:13:44,030
He's Mumbai's businessman. He's
an owner of this factory.

799
01:13:45,034 --> 01:13:47,525
Verma family was a great family.

800
01:13:47,603 --> 01:13:52,097
But they are finished.
Their son Ravi Verma..

801
01:13:52,174 --> 01:13:54,642
..was coming from Mumbai
after marriage.

802
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:58,202
He met a car accident on the
way and he's finished.

803
01:14:07,656 --> 01:14:13,561
Mummy! Mummy! lt's me. Ravi!
Yes, Ravi from Mumbai.

804
01:14:13,629 --> 01:14:17,395
Mummy, l'm Ravi.
- Ravi, how are you, my child?

805
01:14:17,466 --> 01:14:21,232
l'm fine, mummy. We've
won the case.

806
01:14:21,303 --> 01:14:25,569
Yes.. yes.. Surjuda tried to
bribe but nothing turned out.

807
01:14:25,641 --> 01:14:28,667
Now that property and land
has transferred to my name.

808
01:14:28,744 --> 01:14:31,508
God is always there
with the truth.

809
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:34,014
Give it to me, mummy.
l want to talk. - Here.

810
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:37,348
Hello! Congratulations,
brother. l'm Pinky.

811
01:14:38,087 --> 01:14:41,181
Now you must bring many
imported dresses for me.

812
01:14:41,257 --> 01:14:44,192
Yes, l remember the entire
list of your demands..

813
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:46,091
..Miss Jyoti Verma.
- Jyoti Verma?

814
01:14:46,162 --> 01:14:50,098
Have you taken a peg?
- l'll slap you now.

815
01:14:50,166 --> 01:14:53,033
Beer and l? - l'm getting it's
smell on the telephone.

816
01:14:53,702 --> 01:14:56,364
Ok, take my swear that
you didn't take it?

817
01:14:56,705 --> 01:14:59,538
lt's ok, if you're telling me to
swear then l've taken a bottle.

818
01:14:59,608 --> 01:15:03,100
Go ahead.
- Look, mummy says liquor..

819
01:15:03,179 --> 01:15:07,047
..can spoil the entire family.
Talk with her.

820
01:15:08,117 --> 01:15:12,053
Mummy, it's a lie.. ok,
mummy. l'm sorry.

821
01:15:12,121 --> 01:15:15,113
Now l'll never take it.
- You come home soon, my child.

822
01:15:15,724 --> 01:15:17,555
l'm feeling very unusual.

823
01:15:18,627 --> 01:15:21,061
Mummy!
- What?

824
01:15:22,131 --> 01:15:24,065
Shall l tell you one secret?
- What?

825
01:15:24,133 --> 01:15:26,124
l hope you won't get angry.
- Have you seen mother's..

826
01:15:26,202 --> 01:15:29,569
..anger lasting for
more than a moment?

827
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:34,002
Mummy, l've got married.

828
01:15:36,178 --> 01:15:41,514
With whom? That Kamini?
- Yes, mummy.

829
01:15:41,584 --> 01:15:44,018
l had to take this decision
today itself.

830
01:15:44,086 --> 01:15:45,144
Otherwise her brother and..

831
01:15:45,221 --> 01:15:47,018
..uncle were sending
her to London.

832
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:51,184
Now when you're married,
what l can say in this?

833
01:15:52,494 --> 01:15:54,553
Bring her home soon.
l'll arrange..

834
01:15:54,630 --> 01:15:57,030
..your marriage with full pomp.

835
01:15:57,099 --> 01:16:00,034
Mummy, l hope it didn't hurt you.

836
01:16:01,103 --> 01:16:04,197
Parents happiness lies
in their children.

837
01:16:04,707 --> 01:16:07,039
Oh mummy, you're great.
Mummy, you're great!

838
01:16:07,109 --> 01:16:09,202
l love you.
- You come home soon, my child.

839
01:16:10,212 --> 01:16:12,043
We're waiting for you.

840
01:16:12,114 --> 01:16:14,082
l promise you, mummy.
l'll definitely come.

841
01:16:14,149 --> 01:16:15,207
l'll come, mummy. l'll come.

842
01:16:15,284 --> 01:16:18,048
l'll come. l'll definitely
come, mummy.

843
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,054
l'll come back soon.

844
01:17:08,203 --> 01:17:12,537
Monty! You're so stupid! ldiot!

845
01:17:12,608 --> 01:17:14,542
How come you left from
home without informing?

846
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:17,101
l've good news. Queen
has come back.

847
01:17:17,179 --> 01:17:19,204
Tonight there's a party
in the palace.

848
01:17:19,281 --> 01:17:22,216
And you're invited there
with me. For me.

849
01:17:22,284 --> 01:17:25,117
No.. for us.
- Leave it to me, Tina.

850
01:17:25,187 --> 01:17:27,121
No excuse. C'mon, we have
to go home early.

851
01:17:27,189 --> 01:17:28,656
What's this, Tina?
- We have to go for a party.

852
01:17:28,724 --> 01:17:30,055
And you must wear
a first class suit.

853
01:17:30,125 --> 01:17:32,059
And Kabir uncle was saying that
l'll go with him first..

854
01:17:32,127 --> 01:17:33,389
..and then you'll come.

855
01:17:33,462 --> 01:17:36,056
C'mon, now sit inside. What are
you doing? You please drive it.

856
01:17:36,131 --> 01:17:37,996
Do you know how big the party is?

857
01:17:38,067 --> 01:17:40,001
Big personalities will
be coming there.

858
01:17:40,069 --> 01:17:42,060
This strange incidence is
shaking me from inside, Dayal.

859
01:17:42,671 --> 01:17:44,536
You please keep this with you only.

860
01:17:45,174 --> 01:17:47,165
Otherwise people will just
laugh instead of believing it.

861
01:17:48,077 --> 01:17:52,173
l've seen it personally. That same
city, same palace, same factory..

862
01:17:52,514 --> 01:17:54,505
..where l used to live
in my last birth.

863
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:56,517
My last birth's name was Ravi Verma.

864
01:17:57,086 --> 01:17:59,020
But the face was totally different.

865
01:17:59,488 --> 01:18:02,514
l don't know anything
about my last birth's..

866
01:18:02,591 --> 01:18:04,081
..mother, sister and
wife's whereabouts.

867
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,184
So l think l might have to
live here for few more days.

868
01:18:06,695 --> 01:18:09,562
Tonight, l'm going to
meet Tina's queen..

869
01:18:09,631 --> 01:18:12,031
..who has educated and provided
all her needs from her childhood.

870
01:18:12,101 --> 01:18:15,195
l'll write you the rest of the
things later, yours Monty.

871
01:18:17,373 --> 01:18:19,102
You stupid, you idiot,
can't you see?

872
01:18:19,174 --> 01:18:21,369
l can see.. l can see..

873
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:24,543
But you can't see that l can.

874
01:18:25,514 --> 01:18:28,540
Rebirth.. different face.

875
01:18:28,617 --> 01:18:31,108
Rebirth.. Ravi Verma.

876
01:18:35,124 --> 01:18:40,562
Monty! Monty!

877
01:18:40,629 --> 01:18:42,563
l'm waiting for you from
last half an hour.

878
01:18:42,631 --> 01:18:44,121
The party is at its peak inside.

879
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:46,064
So many big personalities have come.
Queen is also there.

880
01:18:46,135 --> 01:18:49,127
l've told her everything about you.

881
01:18:49,204 --> 01:18:51,069
Why are you standing here? C'mon..

882
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:53,574
Look, behave very innocently
with queen.

883
01:18:53,642 --> 01:18:55,610
l know. Why are you instructing me?

884
01:18:55,677 --> 01:18:57,235
Don't forget your limits. Shut up!

885
01:18:57,312 --> 01:18:59,075
You must listen to me.
And listen,..

886
01:18:59,148 --> 01:19:01,241
..if she'll request for
a song, do not refuse.

887
01:19:01,316 --> 01:19:03,682
lf queen will be impressed,
everything will be fine.

888
01:19:06,555 --> 01:19:08,079
Queen is not seen anywhere?

889
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:12,093
You just wait here. l'll just come.

890
01:19:22,571 --> 01:19:24,596
Excuse me! Good evening, Queen.

891
01:19:25,174 --> 01:19:28,268
He has come. l had told
you about him, didn't l?

892
01:19:28,644 --> 01:19:32,375
Will you please meet him?
Please.. please..

893
01:19:39,555 --> 01:19:41,386
Queen, he's that person.

894
01:19:42,224 --> 01:19:44,055
Monty!

895
01:19:47,396 --> 01:19:49,057
Hello!

896
01:20:32,497 --> 01:20:34,431
Who lives in this palace, guard?

897
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,432
There is a queen who
has everything from..

898
01:20:37,502 --> 01:20:41,495
..servants to wealth, but
there are lack of humans.

899
01:20:41,573 --> 01:20:43,438
She leaves in the mornings and..

900
01:20:43,508 --> 01:20:44,566
..comes back in the evenings.

901
01:20:44,643 --> 01:20:46,440
l don't know sir where
she comes from..

902
01:20:46,511 --> 01:20:47,569
..or where she goes.

903
01:20:47,646 --> 01:20:50,444
But they say that you
should never try..

904
01:20:50,515 --> 01:20:52,449
..to know too much about the rich.

905
01:20:53,518 --> 01:20:56,510
What shall l do? l am
just an employee.

906
01:20:56,588 --> 01:20:59,523
l do my work, take my
salary and go away.

907
01:21:00,459 --> 01:21:02,620
No discussion. Just
coming and going.

908
01:21:18,543 --> 01:21:20,977
Ravi Verma died in a car accident.

909
01:21:21,046 --> 01:21:23,742
This news was given
by Kamani Devi.

910
01:21:24,082 --> 01:21:27,483
But within 1 year she
threw both the..

911
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:29,918
..helpless women from the house.

912
01:21:31,490 --> 01:21:33,424
That time Kamani Devi
had become the owner..

913
01:21:33,492 --> 01:21:35,426
..of the palace and the factory.

914
01:21:35,527 --> 01:21:38,758
What could l have said?
l was just a servant.

915
01:21:39,564 --> 01:21:41,759
One day her plan succeeded.

916
01:21:43,602 --> 01:21:45,934
Why don't you just ask
me to commit suicide?

917
01:21:46,004 --> 01:21:48,939
By mixing poison in my food,
you want to kill me.

918
01:21:49,508 --> 01:21:51,601
Why are you after my life?

919
01:21:51,676 --> 01:21:53,940
What a shameful thing
to say, bhabhi?

920
01:21:54,012 --> 01:21:55,775
You are putting such blame on me.

921
01:21:56,782 --> 01:21:58,613
Will l try to kill my brother's
wife? - Shut up!

922
01:22:00,051 --> 01:22:01,951
lt was good that l
fed the cat first.

923
01:22:02,621 --> 01:22:04,521
Otherwise my sister would
have been lying dead.

924
01:22:05,056 --> 01:22:06,785
Today a decision will be reached.

925
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:09,525
l will call the police and
if l don't put these..

926
01:22:09,594 --> 01:22:11,619
..two women behind bars, then..

927
01:22:11,696 --> 01:22:13,459
..my name is not Charanjeet.

928
01:22:13,532 --> 01:22:15,966
They are jealous of my sister's
fame and fortune.

929
01:22:17,135 --> 01:22:20,798
Today, police will come
into this house.

930
01:22:24,743 --> 01:22:26,574
No police has ever come
to the household of..

931
01:22:26,645 --> 01:22:28,909
..Shanta Prasad Verma, and
nor will they ever come.

932
01:22:31,483 --> 01:22:33,917
Daughter-in-law, our tears
from my son's death..

933
01:22:33,985 --> 01:22:35,885
..hasn't dried yet.

934
01:22:37,489 --> 01:22:41,585
And before the Verma family
is disgraced in society..

935
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:45,596
..we will go to some place
else and shed our tears.

936
01:22:47,599 --> 01:22:49,430
Come on, daughter.

937
01:22:49,935 --> 01:22:53,496
Such times have come when we
have to leave the house..

938
01:22:53,572 --> 01:22:55,597
..built by my husband and son.

939
01:22:56,441 --> 01:23:00,605
Daughter-in-law, the house
is yours. Take care of it.

940
01:23:01,112 --> 01:23:04,445
We are going far-far away.

941
01:23:04,516 --> 01:23:08,612
Where the mother and daughter
went, no one knows.

942
01:23:08,687 --> 01:23:11,451
Sir, that day even l quit the job.

943
01:23:12,057 --> 01:23:15,959
lf someone says that
they are dead..

944
01:23:16,027 --> 01:23:18,518
..then l won't be surprised.

945
01:23:27,005 --> 01:23:29,735
What is it?
- The big car has come.

946
01:23:29,808 --> 01:23:33,005
Okay, l know. You go away
from here. - Yes.

947
01:23:37,582 --> 01:23:40,949
What happened, Trilokchand?
What happened? Speak up?

948
01:23:41,019 --> 01:23:45,479
Old horse, red reins.
- Oh, God!

949
01:23:47,959 --> 01:23:50,484
Beautiful shot!

950
01:24:03,909 --> 01:24:05,433
Let's move ahead.

951
01:24:13,618 --> 01:24:15,609
l am saying the truth, S.P sir.

952
01:24:15,687 --> 01:24:19,953
5 years ago our neighbor Mr.
Mathur crossed the..

953
01:24:20,025 --> 01:24:23,893
..railway line and went into
the forest of Champapur.

954
01:24:23,962 --> 01:24:25,395
And hasn't returned till today.

955
01:24:25,463 --> 01:24:28,398
People thought that maybe
some tiger ate him up.

956
01:24:28,466 --> 01:24:32,459
But the villagers say that Mr.
Mathur is seen walking about..

957
01:24:32,537 --> 01:24:35,404
..along the railway line.

958
01:24:35,473 --> 01:24:38,408
And when anyone goes near
him, he disappears.

959
01:24:40,412 --> 01:24:43,006
Despite being the magistrate
of this town..

960
01:24:43,081 --> 01:24:45,413
..you believe in these
ghost stories.

961
01:24:46,918 --> 01:24:49,478
l am sorry! l don't believe
in ghost stories.

962
01:24:49,554 --> 01:24:54,924
How can a person come back after
dying? lt's not possible.

963
01:24:55,593 --> 01:25:00,496
My daughter says the same thing,
but for God's sake..

964
01:25:00,565 --> 01:25:02,965
..don't talk such stuff,
otherwise l will get nightmares.

965
01:25:04,602 --> 01:25:09,505
Very nice party.
- l am glad you could come.

966
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:17,445
May l help you, madam?
- Oh yes! Thank you.

967
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:30,553
Yes, Mr. Monty lives in
this very guest house.

968
01:25:30,628 --> 01:25:32,721
But these days, he leaves
very early in the morning.

969
01:25:32,797 --> 01:25:34,389
And comes back late at night.

970
01:25:34,466 --> 01:25:36,559
Who are you?
- l am Chanda. The maid-servant.

971
01:25:38,403 --> 01:25:40,394
Saw uncle, how he has become?

972
01:25:40,472 --> 01:25:44,465
Since he saw that queen, he
does not care about me.

973
01:25:44,542 --> 01:25:46,407
l have heard that everyday he
makes a trip to the palace.

974
01:25:47,912 --> 01:25:49,402
Palace?

975
01:26:07,599 --> 01:26:09,499
What do you want?

976
01:26:12,504 --> 01:26:15,598
What do you want? l said
what do you want?

977
01:26:17,776 --> 01:26:22,543
Who allowed you to come in?
Jorjee! Jorjee! Mangara!

978
01:26:23,982 --> 01:26:26,883
Go away from here. l said
go away from here.

979
01:26:28,453 --> 01:26:30,387
Get out of here.

980
01:26:32,857 --> 01:26:36,725
You! - Shut up! Do you know
whom you are speaking to?

981
01:26:41,566 --> 01:26:44,899
Kabira, take him away!
Take him away!

982
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:49,404
Come on, let's go!
- No.

983
01:26:50,075 --> 01:26:55,479
Come one, let's go home.
- No, l want her.

984
01:26:56,481 --> 01:27:02,420
l want her, Kabira!
- Monty, lets go home.

985
01:27:02,487 --> 01:27:08,915
l want her, Kabira! l want
her her. Monty let's go!

986
01:27:08,993 --> 01:27:10,927
Leave me! l want to talk to her.
l want to ask her questions.

987
01:27:10,995 --> 01:27:12,428
Let us go!

988
01:27:21,439 --> 01:27:24,374
You looking at the
queen like that..

989
01:27:24,442 --> 01:27:26,535
..is showing disloyalty
towards Tina..

990
01:27:26,611 --> 01:27:29,546
l am not disloyal to Tina!

991
01:27:29,981 --> 01:27:32,381
l am worried by the disloyalty
shown to me.

992
01:27:32,984 --> 01:27:35,885
lf you don't want to tell
your story, then don't say.

993
01:27:35,954 --> 01:27:37,888
But if you want to
know the truth..

994
01:27:37,956 --> 01:27:39,890
..about the Queen, then
ask me, who has spent..

995
01:27:39,958 --> 01:27:43,450
..10 years in the lock
up because of her.

996
01:27:43,895 --> 01:27:45,385
What do you know?

997
01:27:47,065 --> 01:27:49,397
10 years ago, my childhood
friend and..

998
01:27:49,467 --> 01:27:52,459
..Tina's father, Ramcharan,
was an old..

999
01:27:52,537 --> 01:27:55,472
..servant at the palace.

1000
01:27:56,074 --> 01:27:58,907
But because of his drinking
habits he could not give..

1001
01:27:58,977 --> 01:28:00,945
..love to the motherless Tina.

1002
01:28:01,746 --> 01:28:04,579
Tina always used to search
for her Kabira uncle.

1003
01:28:05,483 --> 01:28:07,417
lt was a Friday night.

1004
01:28:07,485 --> 01:28:10,420
When l reached Ramcharan's
quarter, l saw Tina crying.

1005
01:28:10,922 --> 01:28:13,413
Ramcharan was drunk.

1006
01:28:14,025 --> 01:28:16,493
That day there was a quarrel
between Ramcharan..

1007
01:28:16,561 --> 01:28:18,426
..and me regarding Tina.

1008
01:28:18,496 --> 01:28:21,488
Neither did he allow me
to take Tina home..

1009
01:28:21,566 --> 01:28:23,761
..nor did he look after properly.

1010
01:28:24,602 --> 01:28:27,765
ln his drunken state
he abused me and..

1011
01:28:27,839 --> 01:28:29,431
..his destiny and left the house.

1012
01:28:29,507 --> 01:28:32,442
l started consoling the poor girl.

1013
01:28:33,778 --> 01:28:36,440
When he went out, Ramcharan
heard the queen..

1014
01:28:36,514 --> 01:28:38,505
..and his brother Charanjeet..

1015
01:28:38,583 --> 01:28:41,450
..who was being scolded
by a few strangers.

1016
01:28:41,519 --> 01:28:43,783
God knows what secrets he heard..

1017
01:28:43,855 --> 01:28:45,447
..that he came back to his senses.

1018
01:28:46,624 --> 01:28:50,617
The queen's brother saw
him and followed him.

1019
01:28:54,632 --> 01:28:56,964
The person who knows the
secrets of the queen..

1020
01:28:57,035 --> 01:28:58,969
..cannot live in this
world, Ramcharan.

1021
01:29:00,538 --> 01:29:02,472
Kabira!

1022
01:29:08,813 --> 01:29:10,542
Ramcharan, what secret
was he talking about?

1023
01:29:11,149 --> 01:29:15,643
Ravi Verma, Kali Temple
and the Queen!

1024
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:18,985
Saying these few words,
my friend passed away.

1025
01:29:24,596 --> 01:29:26,496
But big people have big nets.

1026
01:29:26,564 --> 01:29:29,431
God knows how the police
came there suddenly.

1027
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:32,435
l accepted my crime in
front of the police.

1028
01:29:33,104 --> 01:29:34,935
That's when Tina came
crying in front of me.

1029
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:39,933
l picked her up in my lap
and took her to the Queen.

1030
01:29:40,912 --> 01:29:43,938
Your highness, this
is orphaned child..

1031
01:29:44,015 --> 01:29:45,949
..of your faithful servant.

1032
01:29:46,951 --> 01:29:51,786
Now, her burden is on you, like
one burden is on my heart.

1033
01:29:54,792 --> 01:29:57,056
Before dying Ramcharan spoke
about the secret of..

1034
01:29:57,128 --> 01:29:58,789
..Kali temple.. l will leave, now.

1035
01:30:03,534 --> 01:30:06,628
The very next day the Queen
came to meet me in prison.

1036
01:30:07,005 --> 01:30:08,632
She was very worried.

1037
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:11,474
What secret do you know?

1038
01:30:11,542 --> 01:30:14,807
Such secrets are not
spoken behind bars.

1039
01:30:15,546 --> 01:30:17,480
Only in the courts
are such secrets..

1040
01:30:17,548 --> 01:30:19,482
l asked you what secret
do you know?

1041
01:30:21,552 --> 01:30:23,486
What is the relationship
between the..

1042
01:30:23,554 --> 01:30:26,489
..Kali Temple and Ravi
Verma? This secret.

1043
01:30:26,557 --> 01:30:28,422
What is the price to
forget this secret?

1044
01:30:30,595 --> 01:30:32,495
My daughter Tina should have the..

1045
01:30:32,563 --> 01:30:34,497
..upbringing of the highest class.

1046
01:30:34,565 --> 01:30:40,504
l will perform my responsibility
loyally. l promise.

1047
01:30:40,571 --> 01:30:43,768
Kabira is the second name
for loyalty, madam.

1048
01:30:46,944 --> 01:30:48,935
This deal was finalized
between the two of us.

1049
01:30:49,914 --> 01:30:52,940
But for 10 years l kept thinking..

1050
01:30:53,017 --> 01:30:55,451
..of the relationship
between Ravi Verma..

1051
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,954
..and the Kali temple.

1052
01:30:58,022 --> 01:30:59,614
l will tell you, Kabira.

1053
01:31:00,124 --> 01:31:01,455
l will tell you what is the
relationship between..

1054
01:31:01,526 --> 01:31:03,460
..Ravi Verma and the Kali temple.

1055
01:31:03,961 --> 01:31:05,451
You?
- Yes me!

1056
01:31:05,963 --> 01:31:07,954
This story is beyond the
beliefs of the world.

1057
01:31:08,032 --> 01:31:10,626
But it has passed over me
as a reality. - Over you?

1058
01:31:10,702 --> 01:31:13,466
Yes, Kabira! Just think.

1059
01:31:14,072 --> 01:31:19,635
A boy loves a girl. He breaks
all norms and marries her.

1060
01:31:20,144 --> 01:31:22,738
And days after their wedding,
the girl kills the boy..

1061
01:31:22,814 --> 01:31:24,907
..just for the sake of his wealth.

1062
01:31:26,417 --> 01:31:31,411
And thanks to nature's miracle,
that heart takes birth again.

1063
01:31:32,590 --> 01:31:34,581
And 21 years later sees that the..

1064
01:31:34,659 --> 01:31:36,752
..same girl has become a queen.

1065
01:31:36,828 --> 01:31:39,922
The life of Verma High
School is my life.

1066
01:31:41,599 --> 01:31:43,590
On the occasion of my husband's..

1067
01:31:43,668 --> 01:31:45,431
..birth anniversary, here
is a cheque of 50,000.

1068
01:31:45,503 --> 01:31:48,495
Verma Convent School belongs
to the Verma family.

1069
01:31:48,940 --> 01:31:52,432
lt belongs to Shanta Prasad
Verma. To Ravi Verma.

1070
01:31:53,111 --> 01:31:55,602
l want to know where
is the Verma family?

1071
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:58,444
Where is this Ravi Verma's
sister? Where is his mother?

1072
01:31:58,516 --> 01:32:01,508
No one knows anything, Kabira.
No one knows anything.

1073
01:32:01,586 --> 01:32:07,456
Oh God! You are that Ravi Verma?
- lt is the truth, Kabira!

1074
01:32:08,526 --> 01:32:09,788
This has happened with me.

1075
01:32:09,861 --> 01:32:11,453
The mountain is on my shoulders.

1076
01:32:12,063 --> 01:32:13,963
l am no mad person to
tell you these stories.

1077
01:32:14,031 --> 01:32:15,794
l have gone mad, Monty.

1078
01:32:16,801 --> 01:32:19,531
l can't even think where
that woman must have..

1079
01:32:19,604 --> 01:32:21,538
..kept your mother and sister.

1080
01:32:21,973 --> 01:32:24,908
l have gone mad searching
for the day and night.

1081
01:32:25,576 --> 01:32:27,908
No one knows anything
and can't say anything.

1082
01:32:27,979 --> 01:32:31,415
Don't worry! l know a few
elders of this village.

1083
01:32:31,482 --> 01:32:34,417
God willing, l will
find both of them.

1084
01:32:43,428 --> 01:32:46,420
After Shanta Prasad,
people will have..

1085
01:32:46,497 --> 01:32:49,933
..only one name on their
lips, Ravi Verma.

1086
01:32:50,935 --> 01:32:53,597
He will clear the debts
of the Verma family.

1087
01:32:53,671 --> 01:32:56,504
He will bring back the fame
and fortune of the family.

1088
01:32:57,608 --> 01:33:01,510
My son, then you shall see the
glow on this widow's face.

1089
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:06,949
l shall start 2 more schools
in his name. - Mother!

1090
01:33:45,590 --> 01:33:48,923
Pinky? - Don't call me Pinky,
my name is Jyoti Verma!

1091
01:33:48,993 --> 01:33:53,487
And l have won this award for
excellence in sitar playing.

1092
01:33:53,564 --> 01:33:55,429
And not for tuning some guitar.

1093
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:57,764
First in sitar and
zero in studies.

1094
01:33:58,102 --> 01:34:00,502
Here, first in studies and as
far as guitar is concerned..

1095
01:34:00,571 --> 01:34:03,768
..one day l will learn
that as well.

1096
01:34:03,841 --> 01:34:06,435
You have broken 12 guitars
in the span of one year.

1097
01:34:06,511 --> 01:34:08,775
And still you don't even know
how to play seven notes.

1098
01:34:08,846 --> 01:34:10,438
Pinky!
- What Pinky?

1099
01:34:10,515 --> 01:34:12,779
You have to take rebirth to
know how to play the guitar.

1100
01:34:30,401 --> 01:34:32,892
l searched the whole world.

1101
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:34,403
l found the whole world.

1102
01:34:35,473 --> 01:34:37,566
But l did not find the ones
l was searching for.

1103
01:34:39,911 --> 01:34:42,903
No one knows where the mother
and her daughter..

1104
01:34:44,482 --> 01:34:47,918
..disappeared years ago.

1105
01:34:50,488 --> 01:34:56,484
l know. The snake which
can bite Ravi Verma.

1106
01:34:58,029 --> 01:35:02,489
lt is not difficult for her to
kill two helpless women, Kabira.

1107
01:35:02,934 --> 01:35:06,597
Monty, even snakes are afraid
of the wrath of the Lord.

1108
01:35:06,671 --> 01:35:09,606
Not this snake, Kabira!
Not this snake!

1109
01:35:09,941 --> 01:35:15,777
lf this fact is true then l swear
on my mother and sister..

1110
01:35:15,846 --> 01:35:19,942
..l will not let her live
for more than a day.

1111
01:35:22,853 --> 01:35:25,447
lf l will be hanged then
l will accept that.

1112
01:35:25,523 --> 01:35:29,892
l am ready to die a thousand
deaths to take revenge.

1113
01:35:31,462 --> 01:35:37,560
To kill that Kamini.

1114
01:35:42,473 --> 01:35:46,739
Oh God, what have you
done to this young man?

1115
01:35:47,878 --> 01:35:51,905
Give him peace or l will
fight against you.

1116
01:36:03,761 --> 01:36:07,492
Kabira sits at your doorsteps
asking you to fulfill all wishes.

1117
01:36:08,566 --> 01:36:13,026
Let them meet. Let them meet.

1118
01:36:34,725 --> 01:36:36,886
Chanda!
- Chanda has not come today, sir.

1119
01:36:36,961 --> 01:36:38,895
l have come to replace her.

1120
01:36:39,563 --> 01:36:41,394
Bring one jug of water.

1121
01:36:41,999 --> 01:36:47,904
Tea is ready, sir. - Now, l will
not drink tea but only alcohol.

1122
01:36:48,472 --> 01:36:50,463
lt is not good to drink
alcohol in the morning.

1123
01:36:50,541 --> 01:36:53,476
Stop talking nonsense
and get the water.

1124
01:36:53,544 --> 01:36:55,409
Wise men have said
that a household..

1125
01:36:55,479 --> 01:36:57,413
..gets spoiled with alcohol, sir.

1126
01:37:05,022 --> 01:37:09,482
You?
- My name is Laxmi.

1127
01:37:09,927 --> 01:37:13,920
l work as a servant in
a bungalow at Talegaon.

1128
01:37:13,998 --> 01:37:19,493
Chanda is not well.
So she sent me here.

1129
01:37:20,604 --> 01:37:23,698
Laxmi? No.

1130
01:37:24,709 --> 01:37:27,439
lf l have made a mistake
then forgive me, sir.

1131
01:37:27,878 --> 01:37:31,871
But it is not good to drink
alcohol at such young age.

1132
01:37:33,718 --> 01:37:37,449
Your name cannot be Laxmi.

1133
01:37:37,855 --> 01:37:41,723
Yes, my name is Laxmi.
l live at Talegaon.

1134
01:37:41,792 --> 01:37:46,559
You are lying. l know you.
Your name is Jyoti.

1135
01:37:47,465 --> 01:37:52,994
No! No, l am not Jyoti!
l am Laxmi.

1136
01:37:53,070 --> 01:37:57,404
You are lying. You are
Jyoti, Jyoti Verma.

1137
01:37:57,475 --> 01:38:03,903
Please don't say this, sir.
Don't mock my poverty.

1138
01:38:04,482 --> 01:38:05,540
Why don't you say that you are..

1139
01:38:05,616 --> 01:38:07,413
..the daughter of Shanta
Prasad Verma?

1140
01:38:07,485 --> 01:38:10,579
Shanta Prasad is dead.
Verma family is dead.

1141
01:38:10,654 --> 01:38:12,417
l have no relation with them.

1142
01:38:12,923 --> 01:38:16,916
l am a beggar woman. l clean
up other people's houses.

1143
01:38:16,994 --> 01:38:21,761
l am a widow who goes from
door to door for work.

1144
01:38:21,832 --> 01:38:23,925
To feed the stomachs
of my old mother..

1145
01:38:24,001 --> 01:38:25,434
..and my 2 children.

1146
01:38:25,503 --> 01:38:30,770
What do you want from me?
Why are you mocking me?

1147
01:38:31,442 --> 01:38:36,505
Why do you make fun of me? Why?

1148
01:38:38,115 --> 01:38:42,449
Pinky!
- Did you call me Pinky, sir?

1149
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:44,451
Yes, Pinky!

1150
01:38:45,523 --> 01:38:49,050
You did not recognize me but
l recognized you, my sister.

1151
01:38:50,995 --> 01:38:57,059
Sister! Did you call me, sister?
- Yes, Pinky!

1152
01:38:59,537 --> 01:39:01,528
Aren't you the sister
of Ravi Verma..

1153
01:39:01,605 --> 01:39:03,539
..who used to call you
Pinky out of love?

1154
01:39:04,141 --> 01:39:06,974
Ravi Verma? How do you
know Ravi Verma?

1155
01:39:10,481 --> 01:39:12,472
Did you see?

1156
01:39:12,550 --> 01:39:14,541
Such a violent storm came
and now it is silent.

1157
01:39:16,554 --> 01:39:20,490
Today, atheists like me will
start believing in God.

1158
01:39:20,958 --> 01:39:24,018
l did not understand?
- l am Ravi Verma..

1159
01:39:25,896 --> 01:39:27,591
l am Ravi Verma's..

1160
01:39:27,665 --> 01:39:30,031
No, my father was a
friend of Ravi Verma.

1161
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:31,761
l have come from Bombay.

1162
01:39:31,836 --> 01:39:34,930
Brother used to keep
going to Bombay.

1163
01:39:37,508 --> 01:39:39,601
Your family portrait
is at my house.

1164
01:39:41,512 --> 01:39:44,777
My daddy had told me to find
out about the Verma..

1165
01:39:44,849 --> 01:39:46,510
..family whenever l come here.

1166
01:39:47,051 --> 01:39:50,953
He too searched a lot but
he did not get any news.

1167
01:39:51,021 --> 01:39:53,615
We have died for the world, sir.

1168
01:39:54,625 --> 01:39:59,460
After brother's death life
only gave us darkness.

1169
01:40:00,130 --> 01:40:06,933
l and my mother are alive
like two corpses.

1170
01:40:07,004 --> 01:40:10,633
Your mother? How is mother?
Where is she?

1171
01:40:11,475 --> 01:40:13,466
l want to meet her immediately,
please.

1172
01:40:14,545 --> 01:40:16,479
What is the use of meeting
mother, sir?

1173
01:40:17,548 --> 01:40:19,482
She is a blown out candle..

1174
01:40:19,550 --> 01:40:24,487
..who thinks that one day
there shall be light.

1175
01:40:24,555 --> 01:40:26,489
She's gone crazy.

1176
01:40:26,924 --> 01:40:29,415
lt's been 21 years since
brother's death.

1177
01:40:29,927 --> 01:40:33,590
Since that day she hasn't
been able to speak or hear.

1178
01:40:35,900 --> 01:40:37,959
During this poverty,
l got married.

1179
01:40:38,602 --> 01:40:41,435
But within 3 years, my
husband passed away..

1180
01:40:41,505 --> 01:40:44,440
..leaving on us the
burden of 2 children.

1181
01:40:45,609 --> 01:40:48,442
And the burden of troubles
kept on increasing.

1182
01:40:50,047 --> 01:40:52,447
Give it to me! l will
wash my clothes myself.

1183
01:40:52,516 --> 01:40:54,507
Shut up, you are small now!

1184
01:40:54,585 --> 01:40:57,110
Grandma, if Aseem washes
my clothes without soap..

1185
01:40:57,187 --> 01:40:58,518
..so won't they tear off?

1186
01:40:58,589 --> 01:41:00,454
Who will bring soap? Your uncle?

1187
01:41:00,524 --> 01:41:02,958
Grandma, Aseem is teasing me.

1188
01:41:03,027 --> 01:41:06,793
Why are you troubling grandma?
Can she hear?

1189
01:41:06,864 --> 01:41:09,458
Let mother come! l will
tell her everything.

1190
01:41:09,533 --> 01:41:11,967
Just wash the clothes.
Don't trouble grandma.

1191
01:41:12,036 --> 01:41:14,971
We have no status to
go to the doctor.

1192
01:41:15,639 --> 01:41:18,631
We have tried all types
of herbal medicines.

1193
01:41:19,810 --> 01:41:22,904
Mother probably does not
even know what sleep is?

1194
01:41:25,482 --> 01:41:28,918
She keeps looking at Ravi's
picture for hours.

1195
01:42:02,619 --> 01:42:07,955
Ravi has come! Ravi has come!

1196
01:42:10,928 --> 01:42:13,988
You have come, son!
- Grandma! Mother!

1197
01:42:15,799 --> 01:42:20,463
Mother, grandma has started
speaking. - The sage.

1198
01:42:21,138 --> 01:42:29,409
Ravi you have come. Come!
You must be very tired.

1199
01:42:30,581 --> 01:42:35,416
Pinky, Ravi has come!
Ravi has come.

1200
01:42:35,486 --> 01:42:41,584
l knew you would come late,
but would definitely come.

1201
01:42:44,962 --> 01:42:47,760
Why aren't you saying anything?

1202
01:42:49,967 --> 01:42:56,930
Ravi! The apple of my eye!
Aren't you my Ravi?

1203
01:42:58,509 --> 01:43:06,507
Why don't you say anything?
My son, Ravi.

1204
01:43:06,583 --> 01:43:11,953
Mother! - Madam, sit down.
This is not your son.

1205
01:43:12,022 --> 01:43:13,785
He is a big shot from Bombay.

1206
01:43:13,857 --> 01:43:15,950
Shut up! Don't speak nonsense.

1207
01:43:16,527 --> 01:43:20,964
This is my son Ravi.
- Mother, sit down.

1208
01:43:21,031 --> 01:43:23,397
You are not well.
Come and sit down.

1209
01:43:23,467 --> 01:43:26,732
This is my son Ravi!
Ask a mother's heart?

1210
01:43:27,738 --> 01:43:35,736
He can cheat everyone, but
not a mother's heart.

1211
01:43:35,813 --> 01:43:38,475
Mother, this is not your son.

1212
01:43:38,549 --> 01:43:44,920
Don't separate me from my son.

1213
01:43:45,589 --> 01:43:49,491
God, if you exist come down,
look into my eyes..

1214
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:54,497
..and say whether this
is my son Ravi or not?

1215
01:43:54,565 --> 01:43:58,934
Mother, please sit down.

1216
01:44:03,774 --> 01:44:06,607
Please leave her alone.

1217
01:44:07,044 --> 01:44:09,945
Sorry sir, but she has received
a mental shock.

1218
01:44:10,013 --> 01:44:11,947
Didn't l tell you to leave
her alone? - Let's go.

1219
01:44:12,015 --> 01:44:14,609
Sir, will handle everything.

1220
01:44:22,926 --> 01:44:29,388
Mother! - Aren't you my brother,
Ravi? - Yes, mother.

1221
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:32,391
Yes! l am Ravi!

1222
01:44:33,570 --> 01:44:37,404
Nobody recognized me,
but you did instantly.

1223
01:44:37,474 --> 01:44:44,903
Saw, my son recognized me.
He recognized his mother.

1224
01:44:45,582 --> 01:44:51,487
Mother, now l have come. You
will listen to me? - Yes!

1225
01:44:52,589 --> 01:44:54,921
Take rest for some time, mother.

1226
01:44:55,759 --> 01:45:10,766
Yes, l will take rest. Now that
you have come, l will sleep.

1227
01:45:11,441 --> 01:45:13,432
Mother, who is this uncle?

1228
01:45:14,511 --> 01:45:21,508
l am your uncle. From now on you
will live with your uncle.

1229
01:45:21,585 --> 01:45:28,457
My messiah heals the wounds.
He Himself inflicted.

1230
01:45:29,526 --> 01:45:34,463
Pinky, go to your brother's house.

1231
01:45:35,065 --> 01:45:38,728
Days of sadness are gone,
happy days are here again.

1232
01:45:39,870 --> 01:45:44,000
Wait and see the games
Kabira plays.

1233
01:46:02,492 --> 01:46:03,891
Monty!
- Move away, Kabira!

1234
01:46:03,961 --> 01:46:05,758
What are you doing?
- l will finish her off.

1235
01:46:05,829 --> 01:46:10,425
Law may not punish her, but l
will. - And law will finish you.

1236
01:46:11,435 --> 01:46:14,427
Because law and police have
no evidence or witness..

1237
01:46:14,504 --> 01:46:18,600
..to prove that Ravi Verma
was killed by Kamini devi.

1238
01:46:19,610 --> 01:46:23,706
Yes, there is one witness.
The Lord.

1239
01:46:24,548 --> 01:46:27,540
Maybe that's why he
has sent you here..

1240
01:46:27,618 --> 01:46:29,552
..so that you force her into
accepting her crime..

1241
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:31,884
..in front of the
world and the law.

1242
01:46:32,856 --> 01:46:36,883
Yes, Monty. We have
to make her suffer.

1243
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:40,452
On every step we have
to place a trap.

1244
01:46:47,471 --> 01:46:49,905
What happened, Charan Singh?
What is in your hand?

1245
01:46:50,407 --> 01:46:54,468
Somebody just came and said
this was your birthday gift.

1246
01:46:54,544 --> 01:46:56,409
Birthday?

1247
01:46:57,481 --> 01:46:59,574
But no one here knows that
today is my birthday.

1248
01:47:01,585 --> 01:47:03,416
Let me see!

1249
01:47:14,765 --> 01:47:16,426
Stupid!

1250
01:47:37,454 --> 01:47:39,388
What happened?

1251
01:47:40,457 --> 01:47:42,550
Your car has given up, madam.

1252
01:47:45,929 --> 01:47:49,456
You? What are you doing here?

1253
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,902
Get the hell out of my car.
Come on, get out! Out!

1254
01:47:56,406 --> 01:48:00,001
Why are you after me?
l want to know.

1255
01:48:00,477 --> 01:48:02,911
Who gave you this car? Who
let you become a driver?

1256
01:48:02,979 --> 01:48:06,915
Driver? Your highness,
l am not poor.

1257
01:48:07,417 --> 01:48:11,478
But yes l am weak at heart.
You must have got my gift.

1258
01:48:11,555 --> 01:48:14,752
Be thankful l did not
inform the police.

1259
01:48:14,825 --> 01:48:17,589
Police, law, l will
accept everything.

1260
01:48:18,095 --> 01:48:21,758
Even if you send me to heaven,
l will comeback.

1261
01:48:21,832 --> 01:48:25,427
Shut up!
- l want to remain quiet.

1262
01:48:26,770 --> 01:48:29,603
But what can l say l have
to clear my heart.

1263
01:48:29,673 --> 01:48:33,439
That l fell in love with
you, at first sight.

1264
01:48:34,911 --> 01:48:39,041
Nonsense! Get lost will you?
- Okay!

1265
01:48:45,055 --> 01:48:46,454
lt is not good for a
lady to stay alone..

1266
01:48:46,523 --> 01:48:48,457
..out in the wilderness,
Miss Kamini.

1267
01:48:48,525 --> 01:48:50,459
Think about it?

1268
01:48:52,462 --> 01:48:54,623
Excuse me!
- My name is Monty.

1269
01:48:55,465 --> 01:48:56,523
See, your car has broken down.

1270
01:48:56,600 --> 01:49:00,536
There is a garage in the
village down there.

1271
01:49:00,604 --> 01:49:02,629
And cars are repaired
only in garages.

1272
01:49:47,918 --> 01:49:56,622
lt's amazing, it's amazing,
it's amazing.

1273
01:49:56,693 --> 01:50:09,538
We fakirs know the condition
of everyone's heart.

1274
01:50:09,606 --> 01:50:14,543
lt's amazing, it's amazing.

1275
01:50:28,592 --> 01:50:32,926
lt's amazing, it's amazing,
it's amazing.

1276
01:50:32,996 --> 01:50:39,595
We fakirs know the condition
of everyone's heart.

1277
01:50:39,669 --> 01:50:43,935
lt's amazing, it's amazing.

1278
01:50:46,776 --> 01:50:50,610
Oh Fakir check me up..

1279
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:54,946
..give me medicines
for the sweet pains.

1280
01:50:55,018 --> 01:50:58,954
Oh Fakir check me up..

1281
01:50:59,022 --> 01:51:03,459
..give me medicines
for the sweet pains.

1282
01:51:03,527 --> 01:51:07,964
l will chase the ghosts away
and kill the illness.

1283
01:51:08,031 --> 01:51:11,797
l will chase the ghosts away
and kill the illness.

1284
01:51:11,868 --> 01:51:18,637
But what do l do with this,
this is love sickness.

1285
01:51:18,708 --> 01:51:22,474
lt's amazing, it's amazing.

1286
01:51:22,546 --> 01:51:27,483
lt's amazing, it's amazing,
it's amazing.

1287
01:51:27,551 --> 01:51:35,925
Oh good man of God,
come answer me.

1288
01:52:09,526 --> 01:52:18,798
How many stars are there in
the sky, give me an answer?

1289
01:52:21,638 --> 01:52:29,909
Count all the flowers
in the world.

1290
01:52:29,980 --> 01:52:34,474
The number of flowers are equal
to the number of stars.

1291
01:52:34,551 --> 01:52:36,576
That is my answer.

1292
01:52:36,653 --> 01:52:40,919
lt's amazing, it's amazing.

1293
01:52:40,991 --> 01:52:45,428
lt's amazing, it's amazing,
it's amazing.

1294
01:53:17,927 --> 01:53:20,623
Young girl, you also
ask some question.

1295
01:53:20,997 --> 01:53:22,726
Clear your heart's doubts.

1296
01:53:22,799 --> 01:53:24,562
l will tell you, fakir.

1297
01:53:26,469 --> 01:53:32,567
On her lips many love
stories are there.

1298
01:53:33,009 --> 01:53:38,743
On her lips many love
stories are there.

1299
01:53:38,815 --> 01:53:45,482
Again youth his coming back
to her love stories.

1300
01:53:45,555 --> 01:53:49,753
JAWANlYA ! JAWANlYA !

1301
01:53:49,826 --> 01:54:01,761
You are too immature,
use your brains.

1302
01:54:02,772 --> 01:54:11,441
He who is in your heart,
hold his hand.

1303
01:54:11,514 --> 01:54:16,611
You have knitted this net
with your own hands.

1304
01:54:16,686 --> 01:54:23,717
lt's amazing, it's amazing,
it's amazing.

1305
01:54:23,793 --> 01:54:36,570
We fakirs know the condition
of everyone's heart.

1306
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:46,412
lt's amazing, it's amazing.

1307
01:54:46,483 --> 01:54:54,481
lt's amazing, it's amazing,
it's amazing.

1308
01:55:21,618 --> 01:55:27,557
Mithu, now nobody can say that
the queen is getting old.

1309
01:55:31,060 --> 01:55:38,557
Mithu, l am so happy tonight.
Good night, sweet dreams.

1310
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:54,576
No!

1311
01:55:59,022 --> 01:56:00,489
No!

1312
01:56:41,064 --> 01:56:42,554
No, Monty!

1313
01:56:45,935 --> 01:56:47,402
Oh, no!

1314
01:56:49,472 --> 01:56:53,408
Please no.

1315
01:57:00,483 --> 01:57:09,755
Monty, he is dead!

1316
01:57:12,595 --> 01:57:14,495
Anyone who is trying to harm you..

1317
01:57:14,564 --> 01:57:17,761
..will get the same fate
from Monty. - But why?

1318
01:57:17,834 --> 01:57:24,865
lt is not what you think.
l don't want your riches.

1319
01:57:26,442 --> 01:57:29,878
l want you and your love.

1320
01:57:30,380 --> 01:57:32,371
Someone to tell me she is mine.

1321
01:57:43,559 --> 01:57:51,466
Well done, Jagawar! Amazing role.

1322
01:57:52,735 --> 01:57:54,999
Here is your 400 rupees
and your role is done.

1323
01:57:57,573 --> 01:58:03,409
Ravi! Ravi! Still he
hasn't come back.

1324
01:58:04,013 --> 01:58:06,573
lt is so late at night and
still hasn't comeback.

1325
01:58:08,918 --> 01:58:11,478
Yes, he is coming in a jeep,
with his wife.

1326
01:58:12,555 --> 01:58:14,420
But, why hasn't he come yet?

1327
01:58:15,591 --> 01:58:19,493
l will go and check myself.

1328
01:58:28,905 --> 01:58:33,933
Ravi! Ravi!

1329
01:58:35,611 --> 01:58:39,445
Stop, don't go ahead. Stop!

1330
01:58:59,635 --> 01:59:01,626
Brother, see what has
happened to mother.

1331
01:59:02,138 --> 01:59:05,539
There is nothing to worry about.
Thank God she is safe.

1332
01:59:05,608 --> 01:59:07,473
She is lucky.

1333
01:59:18,821 --> 01:59:20,812
Where all will you search for me?

1334
01:59:21,491 --> 01:59:24,927
How many more times will
you be hit? l have come.

1335
01:59:26,596 --> 01:59:30,589
l will take away all your sorrows.

1336
01:59:31,501 --> 01:59:33,435
Keep all the promises.

1337
01:59:33,503 --> 01:59:35,437
Just look at me once.

1338
01:59:35,505 --> 01:59:36,563
Just look at me once.

1339
01:59:36,906 --> 01:59:42,970
Open your eyes.
- Ravi, you have come.

1340
01:59:43,780 --> 01:59:45,941
See mother, l am in front of you.

1341
01:59:48,518 --> 01:59:52,511
Let's go home. Take me home.

1342
01:59:52,588 --> 01:59:56,524
Yes, mother lie down now.
l will take you home.

1343
01:59:56,592 --> 02:00:03,521
l will take you to the same
house, where l had left you.

1344
02:01:29,919 --> 02:01:31,409
Stop it!

1345
02:01:33,489 --> 02:01:35,423
Where did you learn this tune?

1346
02:01:36,592 --> 02:01:41,586
This tune? lt's very old!
- There is a story behind it.

1347
02:01:42,031 --> 02:01:46,434
Whose?
- My husband's! Ravi Verma's!

1348
02:01:47,503 --> 02:01:52,770
Ravi Verma? - Yes! He liked
this tune very much.

1349
02:01:55,511 --> 02:02:01,450
Monty, please. With this tune..
- You feel something? - Yes!

1350
02:02:05,454 --> 02:02:07,945
Okay, l will not play
in the future.

1351
02:02:14,530 --> 02:02:17,624
What are you seeing?
- Your destiny in your hands.

1352
02:02:19,635 --> 02:02:21,967
What is written on it?
- Amazing!

1353
02:02:22,038 --> 02:02:23,903
Someone's murder is written on it.

1354
02:02:25,942 --> 02:02:28,740
Murder! Don't be silly, Monty!

1355
02:02:29,879 --> 02:02:32,905
You have murdered me.
- You?

1356
02:02:34,483 --> 02:02:36,417
By making me fall for your..

1357
02:02:36,485 --> 02:02:41,422
Now l know why Monty did
not get my telegrams.

1358
02:02:41,490 --> 02:02:43,583
lf you have understood,
Mr. Oberoi..

1359
02:02:43,659 --> 02:02:45,490
..then there is no use in arguing.

1360
02:02:46,562 --> 02:02:50,589
So have you decided to leave me?
- Yes!

1361
02:02:50,666 --> 02:02:54,432
Oberoi for you it will mean,
fame and fortune.

1362
02:02:54,503 --> 02:02:56,596
Those only last for 2 seconds,
Mr. Oberoi.

1363
02:02:56,672 --> 02:03:00,506
l will sue you.
- With pleasure. - l am leaving.

1364
02:03:00,576 --> 02:03:02,976
l won't stop you. Goodbye.

1365
02:03:04,513 --> 02:03:06,447
Who was he?

1366
02:03:06,916 --> 02:03:08,781
He was the guardian of my destiny.

1367
02:03:08,851 --> 02:03:10,443
What will happen now?

1368
02:03:11,954 --> 02:03:16,448
He doesn't know that my destiny
is in this palace.

1369
02:03:17,059 --> 02:03:20,460
But Monty, l feel claustrophobic
in here.

1370
02:03:22,565 --> 02:03:24,396
Let's go out somewhere.

1371
02:03:31,874 --> 02:03:34,570
What happened?
- Your car has given up.

1372
02:03:35,478 --> 02:03:37,412
1 minute.

1373
02:03:38,581 --> 02:03:41,880
My mother in Bombay does not
allow me to drive at night.

1374
02:03:41,951 --> 02:03:46,581
lf l am ever late, she wakes
up the whole town.

1375
02:03:47,423 --> 02:03:50,915
She calls up everyone from
the police, hospital..

1376
02:03:50,993 --> 02:03:52,927
There is no water in the radiator.

1377
02:03:53,896 --> 02:03:58,765
But you don't worry. There
is a container here.

1378
02:03:58,834 --> 02:04:01,428
l will get the water. l love you.

1379
02:04:04,774 --> 02:04:06,765
ln the name of the Goddess Kali..

1380
02:04:06,842 --> 02:04:08,503
..may your attack never
miss it's target.

1381
02:04:08,944 --> 02:04:10,935
Let justice be done for all lives.

1382
02:05:11,941 --> 02:05:15,502
lt's getting colder. So l
was talking about mother.

1383
02:05:19,949 --> 02:05:21,780
Why are you sweating
in this cold weather?

1384
02:05:23,452 --> 02:05:26,387
Monty!
- What's wrong you seem worried?

1385
02:05:27,556 --> 02:05:30,389
Ghost!
- Ghost? What ghost?

1386
02:05:32,461 --> 02:05:34,395
l saw ghosts.

1387
02:05:36,999 --> 02:05:38,990
Looks like you are listening
to too many ghost stories.

1388
02:05:39,068 --> 02:05:40,467
That is why you are hallucinating.

1389
02:05:40,536 --> 02:05:44,905
Don't worry darling,
l am with you.

1390
02:05:51,414 --> 02:05:54,906
Monty, look over there. Ghosts
are going in that car.

1391
02:05:54,984 --> 02:05:56,747
Ghosts? Where?

1392
02:05:58,487 --> 02:06:00,421
What happened to you?

1393
02:06:00,489 --> 02:06:02,423
l didn't see any car or any ghost.

1394
02:06:02,491 --> 02:06:06,427
There! - What's wrong with you?

1395
02:06:06,495 --> 02:06:11,592
Have gone nuts? There is
nothing over there.

1396
02:06:12,601 --> 02:06:15,434
You didn't see anything.
- There is nothing there.

1397
02:06:18,607 --> 02:06:20,438
Monty, what has happened to me?

1398
02:06:21,510 --> 02:06:23,375
You need rest.

1399
02:06:25,548 --> 02:06:27,539
Your Highness, it isn't
safe for you..

1400
02:06:27,616 --> 02:06:29,379
..to have so many medicines.

1401
02:06:29,452 --> 02:06:31,443
The doctor has already
cautioned you.

1402
02:06:35,791 --> 02:06:38,055
Monty, cannot come for the
opening of your hotel.

1403
02:06:38,127 --> 02:06:39,719
l am not responsible for this.

1404
02:06:40,996 --> 02:06:44,454
lf you want to see the truth,
you can see it for yourself.

1405
02:06:44,900 --> 02:06:47,892
How my golden bird is trapped
in your palace's cage?

1406
02:06:48,737 --> 02:06:50,898
These are your Kamani
Devi's doings.

1407
02:06:53,809 --> 02:06:55,401
Yes, sir?

1408
02:07:03,886 --> 02:07:05,410
See Rita, l had told you.

1409
02:07:05,488 --> 02:07:07,752
He is having an affair
with that woman.

1410
02:07:08,591 --> 02:07:12,027
See how much fun they are having.
l can't even see.

1411
02:07:12,094 --> 02:07:13,493
You tell me what is happening?

1412
02:07:13,562 --> 02:07:15,427
He has opened the door
of the car. - Then?

1413
02:07:15,498 --> 02:07:16,931
She has got down.
- Then?

1414
02:07:16,999 --> 02:07:18,591
She is going inside.
- Then?

1415
02:07:18,667 --> 02:07:20,601
She has stopped.
- Then.

1416
02:07:20,669 --> 02:07:22,864
They are laughing and talking.
- Then.

1417
02:07:22,938 --> 02:07:24,872
Monty is going nearer to her.
- Then.

1418
02:07:26,842 --> 02:07:28,537
Now they are behind the pillar.
- What?

1419
02:07:29,044 --> 02:07:32,707
l can't see anything, Tina.
l think some thing is wrong.

1420
02:07:33,449 --> 02:07:36,714
You haven't told me anything
about your life and husband.

1421
02:07:37,052 --> 02:07:38,713
Although you had promised me.

1422
02:07:38,787 --> 02:07:41,881
l will tell you. But not now.
- Why?

1423
02:07:43,459 --> 02:07:45,393
First, let me trust
you completely.

1424
02:07:46,929 --> 02:07:50,387
Lovers don't ask for trust
certificate, Kamini.

1425
02:07:51,467 --> 02:07:55,733
Monty, l know we have come
close to each other..

1426
02:07:59,008 --> 02:08:01,408
You betrayer! You fool!

1427
02:08:02,478 --> 02:08:04,946
You make promises to
me, and love her.

1428
02:08:05,014 --> 02:08:08,575
You sing songs with me.
l hate you. l hate you!

1429
02:08:08,651 --> 02:08:10,585
Stop it, Tina! Stop it, Tina!

1430
02:08:10,653 --> 02:08:12,917
What is this childishness, Tina!

1431
02:08:13,489 --> 02:08:17,926
l'll run away! l'll die!

1432
02:08:20,095 --> 02:08:23,929
Let her go, Monty! This
was bound to happen.

1433
02:08:25,601 --> 02:08:27,432
You saw what she did?

1434
02:08:27,503 --> 02:08:28,561
lf l had married her, then my..

1435
02:08:28,637 --> 02:08:29,763
..life would have been destroyed.

1436
02:08:29,838 --> 02:08:31,931
l know, l know!

1437
02:08:32,775 --> 02:08:34,936
This is the difference between
a girl and a woman.

1438
02:08:41,617 --> 02:08:45,519
Monty, Monty!
- What happened?

1439
02:08:45,588 --> 02:08:47,783
Tina is leaving this town.
- What are you saying?

1440
02:08:47,856 --> 02:08:51,519
She has left this letter.
She has left home.

1441
02:08:51,594 --> 02:08:53,459
Kabira is searching
for her every where.

1442
02:08:53,529 --> 02:08:55,463
'l can't stand this shock,
Kabira uncle.'

1443
02:08:55,531 --> 02:08:58,625
'Don't try and look for me.
Think that Tina is dead.'

1444
02:09:00,636 --> 02:09:05,073
Shameless girl! Juliet's niece!
Tried to kill herself for love.

1445
02:09:05,541 --> 02:09:08,533
You don't know, he was talking
shameless talk..

1446
02:09:08,611 --> 02:09:10,636
..with the queen.

1447
02:09:10,713 --> 02:09:12,647
Shut up! l am no fool!

1448
02:09:12,715 --> 02:09:17,482
As if he is worried, and you
are increasing his worries.

1449
02:09:17,553 --> 02:09:19,487
What is he worried about?

1450
02:09:21,090 --> 02:09:22,489
For you, who else.

1451
02:09:25,928 --> 02:09:28,021
Thousands of rupees of mine
are stuck with her.

1452
02:09:28,597 --> 02:09:30,929
Don't we need money for yours
and Monty's wedding?

1453
02:09:31,767 --> 02:09:33,428
My wedding?

1454
02:09:34,903 --> 02:09:40,603
Marriage? lt's taking place?
Good! Very good!

1455
02:09:41,110 --> 02:09:43,977
Even l have a daughter.
Exactly like Tina.

1456
02:09:44,980 --> 02:09:47,505
We have called you to perform
for the charity function..

1457
02:09:47,583 --> 02:09:49,517
..organized on the
occasion of the..

1458
02:09:49,585 --> 02:09:51,951
..silver jubilee of
Verma High School.

1459
02:09:52,788 --> 02:09:55,450
l believe that if you participate
in this then..

1460
02:09:55,524 --> 02:09:58,789
..we can collect thousands
of rupees for the school.

1461
02:09:59,628 --> 02:10:02,791
lt is my fortune that l can do
something for Tina's school.

1462
02:10:02,865 --> 02:10:04,628
lt is so nice of you!
- Very good!

1463
02:10:04,700 --> 02:10:06,463
You are a very good boy.

1464
02:10:06,535 --> 02:10:12,474
lf you know any boy exactly
like you, then do say.

1465
02:10:12,541 --> 02:10:14,475
l have a young daughter.

1466
02:10:14,543 --> 02:10:15,601
We have come here for the school..

1467
02:10:15,678 --> 02:10:17,805
..board meeting, Mr. Baptista.

1468
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:21,475
You please come, sing and dance.

1469
02:10:21,550 --> 02:10:26,920
Teach our girls also. Our
girls are very talented.

1470
02:10:26,989 --> 02:10:28,479
Even l have a girl.

1471
02:10:28,557 --> 02:10:32,425
Mrs. Kamini Devi will be the
chief guest on the occasion.

1472
02:10:32,928 --> 02:10:35,419
And that is when she
will inaugurate..

1473
02:10:35,497 --> 02:10:37,431
..the Ravi Verma Memorial
hall as well.

1474
02:10:39,034 --> 02:10:43,494
Ravi Verma Memorial Hall.
l will be there.

1475
02:10:44,039 --> 02:10:45,438
l will definitely come.

1476
02:10:55,617 --> 02:11:04,958
Hello! Hello! Yes this is Mrs.
Kamini Verma. Hello!

1477
02:11:05,060 --> 02:11:11,522
This is Ravi Verma!
- Ravi Verma? Who Ravi Verma?

1478
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:14,535
Your husband, Ravi Verma.

1479
02:11:14,603 --> 02:11:16,468
What nonsense? Who is speaking?

1480
02:11:16,538 --> 02:11:19,974
lf not through the looks,
recognize the voice, darling.

1481
02:11:20,542 --> 02:11:24,911
l am Monty. - Monty? - Yes! What
kind of a joke is this?

1482
02:11:24,980 --> 02:11:26,914
What if we have different faces?

1483
02:11:27,483 --> 02:11:31,010
Actually l am Ravi Verma,
darling, not Monty.

1484
02:11:31,086 --> 02:11:32,576
What nonsense?

1485
02:11:32,654 --> 02:11:36,021
l have no proof, Kamini, with
which l can tell the law..

1486
02:11:36,091 --> 02:11:38,924
..and society that
you murdered me.

1487
02:11:39,595 --> 02:11:41,426
Murder?

1488
02:11:41,497 --> 02:11:43,431
Yes you murdered me when
l was Ravi Verma.

1489
02:11:43,499 --> 02:11:46,491
ln front of the Kali Temple
with a jeep.. - Shut up!

1490
02:11:46,568 --> 02:11:51,938
What has happened to you? Oh no?

1491
02:11:54,042 --> 02:11:56,602
Who is this?
- This is Monty, darling.

1492
02:11:56,678 --> 02:12:00,512
Who is this? Hello!
- Your father is speaking.

1493
02:12:00,949 --> 02:12:02,439
Hello!

1494
02:12:02,518 --> 02:12:05,453
Monty, did you just call me?

1495
02:12:06,054 --> 02:12:08,955
Me? How could l have? l am here.

1496
02:12:18,066 --> 02:12:19,966
Don't kill yourself like this.

1497
02:12:20,636 --> 02:12:24,572
Monty, one day l will
go mad. l will go mad.

1498
02:12:26,742 --> 02:12:29,575
You have already become mad,
Kamini devi. - You?

1499
02:12:29,645 --> 02:12:32,739
Yes, me. Servants of Sir Tudor.

1500
02:12:33,081 --> 02:12:35,481
What do the servants want to say?

1501
02:12:36,418 --> 02:12:39,751
Sir Tudor has called you.
- For what?

1502
02:12:40,489 --> 02:12:42,753
He has come to know
of your actions.

1503
02:12:43,492 --> 02:12:46,427
This is private life,
do you understand?

1504
02:12:46,962 --> 02:12:50,420
Sir Tudor's servants
have no private life.

1505
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:58,599
Get out of here! Get out!
- Okay, let's go.

1506
02:13:05,981 --> 02:13:09,940
Monty, l don't want this wealth.

1507
02:13:12,120 --> 02:13:13,610
l'm fed up of my life.

1508
02:13:14,957 --> 02:13:17,619
Please, take me some place else.

1509
02:13:17,693 --> 02:13:20,628
l don't want to live
in this palace.

1510
02:13:20,696 --> 02:13:23,563
l will take you, day
after tomorrow.

1511
02:13:23,632 --> 02:13:25,896
To Bombay, to my home.

1512
02:13:25,968 --> 02:13:27,902
Why not today? Why not now?

1513
02:13:28,470 --> 02:13:30,404
l have promised to sing
at the function..

1514
02:13:30,472 --> 02:13:31,530
..of Verma High School.

1515
02:13:31,607 --> 02:13:33,404
Let Verma High School
go down the drain.

1516
02:13:35,410 --> 02:13:37,401
For so many years you have lived..

1517
02:13:37,479 --> 02:13:39,413
..like a queen in this palace.

1518
02:13:39,481 --> 02:13:41,415
Everything should be done
in it's proper time..

1519
02:13:41,483 --> 02:13:43,417
..and with proper respect.

1520
02:13:43,485 --> 02:13:46,420
l have called my mother and
sister to the same function.

1521
02:13:47,589 --> 02:13:50,422
Mother will be so happy to
see your status in society.

1522
02:13:51,593 --> 02:13:55,029
When you meet my wife
in Verma High School..

1523
02:13:55,097 --> 02:13:58,760
..as a respectable
daughter-in-law. - Really?

1524
02:13:59,101 --> 02:14:02,036
The reality is this that
my mother is fine now.

1525
02:14:02,604 --> 02:14:05,505
She only has to drink the
milk with her medicines.

1526
02:14:06,608 --> 02:14:08,599
There, again you have
dropped milk.

1527
02:14:08,944 --> 02:14:13,938
Pinky, when he was small, he
used to drop milk like this.

1528
02:14:14,016 --> 02:14:17,952
l never scolded him, but
he is scolding me today.

1529
02:14:19,054 --> 02:14:20,612
Where am l scolding?

1530
02:14:20,689 --> 02:14:24,386
l just want my mother to get
well soon so that l can..

1531
02:14:24,459 --> 02:14:28,725
..take my lovable mother to the
Verma High School function.

1532
02:14:29,398 --> 02:14:32,458
Verma High School?
- Yes mother, Verma High School.

1533
02:14:32,534 --> 02:14:33,592
Our school.

1534
02:14:33,669 --> 02:14:36,001
After sometime, we will
go to that hall and..

1535
02:14:36,071 --> 02:14:37,936
..you shall inaugurate the hall.

1536
02:14:38,006 --> 02:14:41,464
People will applaud and envy
the pride and status..

1537
02:14:41,543 --> 02:14:44,478
..of Mrs. Shanta Prasad Verma.

1538
02:14:45,881 --> 02:14:50,580
God bless you, son! After that
we will go to our palace.

1539
02:14:50,652 --> 02:14:56,488
Yes, mother! We will
go to our house.

1540
02:14:57,926 --> 02:15:02,488
Saw how much my son loves me?

1541
02:15:03,765 --> 02:15:06,962
And for such a long time you
kept that love away from me.

1542
02:15:11,506 --> 02:15:13,440
Now he has come back, so why..

1543
02:15:13,508 --> 02:15:15,772
..are these eyes shedding tears?

1544
02:15:17,446 --> 02:15:21,780
Yes, probably they want
to wash your feet.

1545
02:15:22,050 --> 02:15:25,451
His name is Monty, sir!

1546
02:15:31,727 --> 02:15:33,888
Sir, this is not what
we were thinking?

1547
02:15:34,730 --> 02:15:37,392
lt is to do with Ravi
Verma's property.

1548
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:40,391
Okay, sir!

1549
02:15:49,911 --> 02:15:55,907
Romeo-Juliet, Laila-Majnu,
Shiri-Farhad.

1550
02:15:56,885 --> 02:16:00,753
Their true love is still
remembered by the world.

1551
02:16:01,957 --> 02:16:05,916
l have thought of a name,
which disrespected..

1552
02:16:07,596 --> 02:16:10,588
..love by cheating her own love.

1553
02:16:13,769 --> 02:16:16,761
This is the story of love.

1554
02:16:18,907 --> 02:16:23,708
Some one took life, and
some one gave life.

1555
02:16:32,988 --> 02:16:41,919
There was a beauty,
there was a lover.

1556
02:16:42,998 --> 02:16:54,899
That was the age and
those were the times.

1557
02:16:54,976 --> 02:17:03,406
There was a beauty,
there was a lover.

1558
02:17:03,485 --> 02:17:15,920
That was the age and
those were the times.

1559
02:17:39,888 --> 02:17:47,920
One day they met, they
kept on meeting daily.

1560
02:17:48,563 --> 02:17:55,901
One day they met, they
kept on meeting daily.

1561
02:17:56,571 --> 02:18:00,564
Then their love blossomed, and..

1562
02:18:00,642 --> 02:18:03,907
..everything was destroyed.

1563
02:18:03,979 --> 02:18:11,750
Where are you lost, on
listening this story?

1564
02:18:11,820 --> 02:18:16,484
People are confused, because
they are strangers.

1565
02:18:17,025 --> 02:18:23,931
To the alley of love, we
were just talking about.

1566
02:18:24,499 --> 02:18:32,929
l kept visiting that alley,

1567
02:18:33,008 --> 02:18:40,608
There was a beauty,
there was a lover.

1568
02:18:40,682 --> 02:18:48,953
That was the age, those
were the times.

1569
02:18:49,024 --> 02:18:56,954
There was a beauty,
there was a lover.

1570
02:19:20,555 --> 02:19:28,587
The beauty said, listen
to me beloved.

1571
02:19:28,663 --> 02:19:32,929
This sky and this earth
are nothing without you.

1572
02:19:33,001 --> 02:19:36,937
l will die for you, that
is how much l love you.

1573
02:19:37,005 --> 02:19:41,499
The matter was something
else, she was a thief,

1574
02:19:42,611 --> 02:19:49,517
ln her heart lay the
love for wealth.

1575
02:19:49,584 --> 02:19:57,958
Love at that time was
just an excuse.

1576
02:19:58,026 --> 02:20:05,797
There was a beauty,
there was a lover.

1577
02:20:06,468 --> 02:20:13,965
That was the age, those
were the times.

1578
02:20:14,476 --> 02:20:21,973
There was a beauty,
there was a lover.

1579
02:20:46,041 --> 02:21:03,449
Disloyal lover cheated
on her love.

1580
02:21:03,525 --> 02:21:14,629
She cheated her love and
gave poison to him.

1581
02:21:58,913 --> 02:22:07,946
The youth died.

1582
02:22:08,022 --> 02:22:15,952
And now listen to the story.

1583
02:22:16,030 --> 02:22:19,625
He took birth far away.

1584
02:22:19,701 --> 02:22:23,899
Again he reached there.

1585
02:22:23,972 --> 02:22:32,573
With the face of a stranger
and mind being confused.

1586
02:22:32,647 --> 02:22:36,913
When they confronted.

1587
02:22:36,985 --> 02:22:43,584
The same things happened again.

1588
02:22:43,658 --> 02:22:53,590
This was his debt.

1589
02:22:53,668 --> 02:23:00,767
He had to repay his debt.

1590
02:24:35,904 --> 02:24:37,394
Who are you?

1591
02:24:40,475 --> 02:24:47,005
Who are you? l asked who you are.

1592
02:24:49,484 --> 02:24:53,477
You are not Monty.

1593
02:24:54,889 --> 02:24:58,484
lt is not true. lt is a lie.

1594
02:25:00,495 --> 02:25:06,923
You cannot be Ravi Verma.

1595
02:25:09,938 --> 02:25:12,429
You recognized me perfectly,
Your Highness.

1596
02:25:13,775 --> 02:25:17,506
Look at me properly.
l am Ravi Verma.

1597
02:25:22,884 --> 02:25:24,875
Daughter-in-law of Shanta Prasad..

1598
02:25:26,454 --> 02:25:28,388
The Queen of this town and..

1599
02:25:28,856 --> 02:25:31,381
..servant of Sir Tudor, see.

1600
02:25:31,893 --> 02:25:35,727
Look at this miracle of nature.

1601
02:25:36,731 --> 02:25:39,894
l might not have the
face of Ravi Verma..

1602
02:25:39,968 --> 02:25:41,401
..but the soul remains the same.

1603
02:25:42,737 --> 02:25:45,399
The same Ravi Verma
who was squashed..

1604
02:25:45,473 --> 02:25:48,738
..under the tyres of a jeep
in front of the Kali Temple.

1605
02:25:49,477 --> 02:25:52,469
The same Ravi Verma who
gave you love for love.

1606
02:25:52,547 --> 02:25:53,605
The same Ravi Verma who gave you..

1607
02:25:53,681 --> 02:25:54,739
..fame, fortune and everything,
but you?

1608
02:25:54,816 --> 02:25:56,408
What did you do?

1609
02:25:57,085 --> 02:25:59,918
You only disrespected
the female gender.

1610
02:26:01,022 --> 02:26:06,483
But today your reign ends.

1611
02:26:06,561 --> 02:26:08,586
This palace is not yours,
Kamini Devi.

1612
02:26:08,663 --> 02:26:10,756
lt belongs to Shanta Prasad.

1613
02:26:11,032 --> 02:26:12,499
lt belongs to his son Ravi Verma.

1614
02:26:12,567 --> 02:26:14,501
lt belongs to his old mother,
who is coming into..

1615
02:26:14,569 --> 02:26:17,436
..this house after ages,
to take rest.

1616
02:26:22,043 --> 02:26:25,444
Ravi we have come to our house.

1617
02:26:25,513 --> 02:26:29,381
This house belongs to
Ravi Verma's sister..

1618
02:26:29,884 --> 02:26:32,375
..who spent her youth trying
to keep her old mother..

1619
02:26:32,453 --> 02:26:34,887
..and her two children
from starving.

1620
02:26:35,456 --> 02:26:38,391
She is coming to her brother's
house to ask for her rights.

1621
02:26:40,995 --> 02:26:44,556
Kamini devi, this house belongs
to the Verma family.

1622
02:26:44,632 --> 02:26:46,930
Those members of the
Verma family..

1623
02:26:47,001 --> 02:26:49,561
..who didn't get anything
except darkness.

1624
02:26:49,904 --> 02:26:53,465
Today they are coming into
their house, their palace..

1625
02:26:53,541 --> 02:26:55,907
..to step into new light.

1626
02:27:10,024 --> 02:27:11,924
Do you have any proof
which denies..

1627
02:27:11,993 --> 02:27:13,927
..that you did not
kill Ravi Verma?

1628
02:27:13,995 --> 02:27:15,485
Do you have any proof
which denies..

1629
02:27:15,563 --> 02:27:17,428
..that you did not throw out
his sister and old mother..

1630
02:27:17,498 --> 02:27:19,432
..from this palace and
forced them to..

1631
02:27:19,500 --> 02:27:21,764
..clean the houses
of other people.

1632
02:27:23,037 --> 02:27:27,906
Say that you had killed
Ravi Verma. Say it.

1633
02:27:27,975 --> 02:27:30,705
Remember, Kali Temple, Ravi
Verma! You killed him.

1634
02:27:30,778 --> 02:27:33,372
Say that you killed him!

1635
02:27:33,448 --> 02:27:35,541
Say that you killed him!

1636
02:27:35,616 --> 02:27:37,709
Say that you killed him!

1637
02:27:37,785 --> 02:27:44,714
Yes, yes, yes! l killed Ravi
Verma! l murdered him!

1638
02:27:44,792 --> 02:27:47,727
What do you want to say?

1639
02:27:47,795 --> 02:27:51,891
l killed him! l killed him!

1640
02:27:51,966 --> 02:27:58,565
Ravi Verma, he cannot be alive.
He cannot be alive.

1641
02:28:04,912 --> 02:28:06,573
Kabira!

1642
02:28:06,647 --> 02:28:10,913
Saw it S.P sir, she has
accepted her crime.

1643
02:28:11,486 --> 02:28:16,753
Your Highness, there is
no sound in God's stick.

1644
02:28:17,091 --> 02:28:21,494
But when it hits you,
it hurts badly.

1645
02:28:21,562 --> 02:28:23,496
Kabir uncle!

1646
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:29,502
Kabir uncle, this pistol
is real. lt has bullets.

1647
02:28:30,905 --> 02:28:35,501
So now l get it that how
foreigners came into our lands.

1648
02:28:36,444 --> 02:28:39,607
Roxy, l had told you earlier
that it has been my..

1649
02:28:39,947 --> 02:28:42,939
..hobby to be friends
with all the people..

1650
02:28:43,017 --> 02:28:45,451
..be it Muslims, Hindus
or foreigners.

1651
02:28:46,120 --> 02:28:51,615
But as an lndian l won't let
foreigners rule over here.

1652
02:28:51,692 --> 02:28:53,455
Understand?

1653
02:28:57,532 --> 02:29:01,525
Sir Tudor says that you have
to hand over Kamini to us.

1654
02:29:01,602 --> 02:29:05,538
Tell you mute boss, that a
person whose tongue is..

1655
02:29:05,606 --> 02:29:08,074
..cut, he shouldn't stick it out.

1656
02:29:08,543 --> 02:29:12,536
l will sacrifice my daughter
but.. - No, Kabira!

1657
02:29:13,648 --> 02:29:16,481
lt would be foolishness to
sacrifice Tina for this vamp.

1658
02:29:16,551 --> 02:29:23,423
Judah, we will hand over Kamini
if you hand over Tina.

1659
02:29:26,894 --> 02:29:28,418
We agree.

1660
02:29:28,496 --> 02:29:30,430
Kamini, will walk one
step from there..

1661
02:29:30,498 --> 02:29:32,432
..and Tina will walk
one step from here.

1662
02:29:33,501 --> 02:29:37,437
But if there is any movement,
the bullets will be fired.

1663
02:29:38,940 --> 02:29:40,601
Roxy, leave Tina!

1664
02:30:10,938 --> 02:30:12,462
You vamp!

1665
02:30:21,549 --> 02:30:24,575
Sir Tudor, your game is over.

1666
02:30:26,587 --> 02:30:29,750
Shoes from Kanpur are having fun.

1667
02:30:29,824 --> 02:30:33,760
You will have more fun
in getting beaten up.

1668
02:30:49,610 --> 02:30:51,942
