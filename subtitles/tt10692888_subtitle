-Wait man.

it is the fault of the fly

How can the shopkeeper 
be held responsible?

139
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,240
In all fairness, the case should be 
filed against the fly.

140
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,640
Only because such ordinary cases 
are being underlined...

141

like a cheap underwear with holes.

-Look, Your Honour.

143
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,800
Instead of highlighting legal loopholes 
he is pinpointing holes in an underwear!

144
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,400
His shop's hygiene is questionable 
and he is finding faults with a fly!

145
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,120
Forget the fly! You come 
from an orthodox background.

146
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,840
He is the one supplying tea 
even for you.

147
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,320
Give it some serious thought.

148
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,320
Imagine instead of a fly if your tea 
had a lizard swimming in it...

149
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,160
...and you swallowed it by mistake!

150
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,720
What is the end result aunt?

151
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,720
Not only did he press the panic button 
in the judge's mind...

152
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,720
...he fixed this banner and 
made me join 'Swachh Bharat' party!

-That is his only job!

from a government shop?

Chat with the wind's poems in rapture.

171
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,000
With hope in very step, await happy hours. 
Dance in the rain our green earth showers.

172
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,680
Life will change again for the better. 
A day will dawn with fragrance in the air.

173
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,720
All the seeds have to go up instead. 
There's no other path here to tread.

174
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,880
Wow! Biscuit.

175
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,520
Venba...

176
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,960
Why are you over reacting?

177
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,440
Like a comforter for children innocent, 
flowers enclosed snugly in a blanket.

178
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,840
River winding down the mountain 
as refreshing perspiration.

179
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:58,600
Housing many a life readily 
without complaining daily.

180
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,480
Is the mountain a woman universally?

181
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,880
Venba what did you teach my son?

182
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,920
When my mother-in-law bathes him 
he yells out 'Grandma that's bad-touch'!

183
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,400
If she catches me talking to you...

184
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,120
Womanliness yearns for kinship. 
Lives each day forging friendship.

185
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,480
A mother's heart is selfless to the hilt... 
Her unconditional love has no limit!

186
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:24,040
Even if lying on the funeral pyre lifeless 
she turns into a lamp to spread brightness!

187
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,880
For you to live in happiness.

A bud will blossom on earth, selfless. 
Setting you above everything else!

190
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,360
Trust in yourself with a positive halo. 
Then the world will guard you tomorrow.

191
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,120
You had no time to listen to life 
as a child's prattle without strife!

192
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
I can't hear you.

193
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,720
Sub inspector Suresh!

194
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,600
You were drowning in tears of sorrow 
No one cared about your tomorrow.

195
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,240
Life will change again for the better. 
A day will dawn with fragrance in the air!

196
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,800
All the seeds have to go up instead. 
There is no other path here to tread!

197
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,160
-'Vanakkam' sir. 
-Forget niceties.

198
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,640
-Where is your boss? 
-He has gone for a party meeting.

199
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,720
Make a decent cup of tea for me.

200
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,880
I'll call you after I reach Chennai dear.

201

Sub inspector Suresh Pandian 
nabs chain snatcher, March 2004.'

202
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,000
Where the hell did you vanish 
for a whole week?

203
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,400
Even your daughter was 
wishy washy with her replies.

204
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,560
Didn't I tell you we have 
a hearing you can't miss?

205
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,800
If we had wrapped up this case yesterday 
we would have made a whopping 30000!

206
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,920
Cool... cool.

207
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,920
I had to go to Chennai 
regarding a very important case.

208
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,120
Hereafter, for your information, 
I intend handling only that case.

209
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,240
These chicken feed cases 
are all yours. See you.

210
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,360
Waitees!

211
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,360
How can any case 
be important without me?

212
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,520
I am going in now just for that. 
Follow me and find out for yourself!

213
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,560
What's up with him?

214
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,680
-Next! 
-SC #1352

Good morning.

217
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,000
Kidnapping and brutal killing of 
five children in Ooty on May 2004.

218
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,280
Jothi's case!'

219
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,760
Did I hear it right?

220
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,400
After the investigation, 
the High Court of Chennai has directed...

221
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,760
...the case for trial in 
District Sessions court, Ooty.

222
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,680
Advocate defending this case 
is Venba Pethuraj.

223
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,000
What? 
Venba huh?'

224
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,440
Have you lost your mind?

225
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,000
You were pottering around 
for publicity all along.

226
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,280
I was defending your cases 
for want of nothing else to do.

227
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,080
How can you screw up so bad?

228
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,000
Tomorrow parents whose children were 
kidnapped will queue up in court.

229
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,160
How will you be able to 
look them in their eyes?

230
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,320
How disgusting! It's a sin to 
work for people like you!

231
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
The hearing is fixed 
for 23rd of this month.

232
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,760
Hey Pethuraj! 
Planning to hit the jackpot?'

233
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,480
She killed innocent children mercilessly.

234
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,000
At the time of those killings...

235
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,320
...even the boldest of men who could 
brave the Ooty cold, shivered in fear.

236
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,240
You want to defend such a heartless female.

237
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,080
Don't you think this is 
height of injustice?

238
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,680
If a dog barks it doesn't mean 
every visitor to your house is a thief.

239
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,120
What weird logic!

240
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,320
Intense relief operations have begun 
in areas affected by Gaja cyclone.'

241
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,320

philanthropist in Coimbatore...'

...and donated a relief fund 
to the tune of 10 million.'

245
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,560
One crore!

00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,560
-I went along with him. 
-I know.

247
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,720
Psycho Jothi's case that created terror 
and trauma in Ooty 18 years ago...'

248
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,560
...has been relisted for trial 
in the District Sessions Court in Ooty.'

249
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,120
Girl children were kidnapped 
and killed brutally in 2004 in Ooty.'

250
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,000
Jothi, a North Indian assassin, was 
killed by the police in an encounter.'

251
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,600
Two innocent lads were killed by Jothi.'

252
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,040
Sir is coming.

253
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,600
-Good morning. 
-They want financial aid sir.

254
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,080
-Good morning sir. 
-Vanakkam sir.

255
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,560
Find out what they want 
and do the needful.

256
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
Okay sir!

257
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,280
-You must focus only on your studies. 
-Okay sir.

258
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,440
-If you need anything else ask me. 
-We are indebted to you sir.

259
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,280
You can leave now.

260
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,880
Bring it here.

261
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,800
Jothi's case has been reopened 
for interrogation after 15 years.'

262
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,080
What is your opinion?'

263
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,680
She was punished for her heinous crimes.

264
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,680
This is sheer publicity 
for selfish gains.

265
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,560
If questioned, they will justify it as 
their basic right in a democratic nation.

266
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,040
Picking up a controversy 
for his daughter's debut.

267
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,360
He has planned it to gain publicity.

268
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,560
Don't know how many more lawyers will 
turn into liars defending murderers?

273
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,280
Madam, why have you reopened 
a 15 year old case?

274
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,680
-'Do you know about this case? 
-She is a heartless killer.'

275
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,200
How can you take up that case?'

276
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,120
Is it to gain publicity 
for your debut case?'

277
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,640
Why don't you answer madam?

278
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,960
She strangled children ruthlessly. 
Is it necessary to reopen this case?

279
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,760

-Down! Down!'

How can you walk with only one slipper?

283

SC #1352

284
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,280
Are the petitioner and his advocate here, 
along with the documents as per High Court order?

285
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,880
I'll get really irritated if you start 
at 10 and ask for adjournment at 10:30.

286
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,200
Venba, you can proceed.

287
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,960
Thank you, Your Honour.

288
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,920
The hatred and anger I see flashing 
in the faces of the people assembled here...

289
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,600
...I can very well understand.

290
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,840
I'm also aware of 
the sensitivity of this case.

291
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,880
Every case requires lawful arguments 
and proper witnesses.

292
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,640
If absolute truth is needed...

293
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,480
...mostly the answer is no.

294
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,040
Few years ago,'

295
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,080
...a girl was raped and killed in Assam.

296
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,880
Police nabbed a person with undue haste 
claiming to possess proper evidence.

297
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,160
While he was being interrogated 
in the police station...

298
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,680
...having watched the News 
of the criminal being apprehended,

299
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,440
...around 500 people barged into the station.

300
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,640
They dragged him to the road 
and beat him to death!

301
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,400
Claiming the murdered girl got justice, 
media provided news running to pages!

302
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,160
But that poor man was present 
only on the day of the incident.

303
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,800
He and the rape victim had 
nothing to do with each other...

304
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,880
...which was later proved 
in an enquiry commission.

305
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,040
One minute...

306
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,880
Which case are you comparing 
with the current one?

307
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,240
Was this case closed 
on a rush of emotion?

308
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,040
It was closed 15 years ago 
after proper inquiry by the police.

309
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,520
I don't know why Petition Pethuraj 
has reopened this case!

310
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,880
Everyone knows 'psycho' Jothi...

311
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,680
Sir that's the term used in the News!

312
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,040
Addressing her as 'psycho' Jothi and 
that too you doing so, is a breach of law.

313
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,920
High Court has investigated 
this case properly and directed it here.

314
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,680
If you question...

315
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,400
Contempt of court!

316
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,280
That means you are 
dishonoring the court of law.

317
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Sir, sit down. 
Let her finish.

318
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,600
In cases where we get very emotional...

319
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,160
...sometimes grave mistakes 
like this happen quite often.

320
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,960
Such hidden truths 
are rampant in this case too.

321
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,280
I humbly request you to let me enquire 
into this in a proper manner Your Honour.

322
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,360
Proceed.

323
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,720
I would like to interrogate Ramar, 
an important eye witness in this case.

324
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,280
Good morning, sir.

325
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,680
Mr Ramar...

326
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,240
Aren't you the only eye witness 
of that unfortunate incident?

327
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,280
Yes madam.

328
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,440
What were you doing there 
at that specific time?

329
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,640
I was praying.

330
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,040
I swear madam.

331
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,240
My tea shop is next to the crime scene.

332
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,000
I opened the shop 
and I was praying.

333
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,040
Do you remember 
the events that unfolded?

334
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,760
I remember it crystal clear 
as if it happened only today!

335
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,360
That morning I opened 
the shop earlier than usual.'

336
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,800
Early morning... blue sky!'

337
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,160
It was bitterly cold.'

338
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,520
The road was covered by a cloud of mist.'

339
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,520
So it was quite deserted.'

340
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,800
Then I heard a child screaming, 
'Let me go' some distance away.'

341
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,840
I went in the direction of the scream.'

342
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,280
I saw a woman dragging 
that child by force.'

343
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,440
That's when those two youngsters 
got down from a car.'

344
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,960
Hearing that child's scream 
they tried to rescue her.'

345
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,960
Suddenly that woman 
fished out her gun.'

346
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,960
I was completely rattled.'

347
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,480
Shell shocked, both those lads ran!'

348
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,880
She shot one of them.'

349
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,680
The other lad tried to escape 
by scrambling into the car.'

350
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,800
She shot him too inside the car.'

351
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,640
As soon as I saw the twin murders, 
my stomach literally somersaulted.'

352
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,120
Shaking from head to toe, 
I hid behind a tree.'

353
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,320
Thank God!

354
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,960
The dense mist blurred her vision.

355
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,320
You are repeating shot by shot 
what is shot in that video Ramar.

356
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,440
No madam!

357
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,440
Whatever I witnessed in person...

358
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,160
...is what you saw in the video.

359
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,200
Even now when I think of that incident...

360
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,800
...it sends shivers down my spine!

361
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,280
Okay! Forget that Ramar.

362
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,400
People call you by some other name?

363
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,120
The reason behind that...

364
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm a staunch follower 
of Ma Vi Ka Ramamurthy anna.

365
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,840
You can say I am his right hand!

366
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,600
That's why I'm fondly called 
'All-in-all Ramar' by everyone.

367
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,480
That's the name of my shop too!

368
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,480
-Are you so fond of him? 
-Of course!

369
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,480
Look I've tattooed his name.

370
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,920
It seems you have many photos 
of both of you in your shop.

371
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,800
I won't miss a single birthday of his.

372
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,840
I'll somehow go in search of him 
and click a picture with him.

373
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,880
Every single birthday photo 
you can see in my shop.

374
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,040
But I missed his birthday in 2004.

375
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,920
I didn't even ask you.

376
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,920
Why are you volunteering 
this piece of news?

377
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,400
No, just as information.

378
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,000
Your Honour, every single year without fail...

379
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,960
...this 'All-in-all' Ramar, 
who clicks a photo with his leader,

380
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,440
...has missed out only in 2004.

381
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,560
Why?

382
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,760
Objection Your Honour!

383
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,040
This is an unwarranted question.

384
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,920
Maybe he was held up somewhere else?

385
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,680
She is questioning him 
without any basis!

386
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,080
It is basic and essential sir.

387
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,640
Objection overruled!

388
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,240
On May 5th, 2004...

389
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,560
...the birthday of the leader of 
People's Freedom Party, Mr Ramamurthy,

390
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,600
...was celebrated in Chennai.

391
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,240
Since it was his leader's birthday, 
as usual Ramar stuck to his annual custom.

392
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,720
This is the photo!'

393
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,880
The same hangs in his shop too.'

394
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,720
On May 5th, 2004...

395
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,760
...you witnessed twin murders 
and a kidnapping.

396
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,280
Shell shocked you went home 
and huddled into your bed.

397
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,760
How could you have taken a photo 
in an event in Chennai?

398
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,880
Your Honour...

399
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,520
She has brought some old paper cutting 
and speaking quite incoherently.

400
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,840
Prosecutor sir...

401
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,800
The witness himself is silent.

402
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,320
No madam. 
The thing is...

403
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,600
Nothing Ramar.

404
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,800
Because you lied through your teeth!

405
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,680
You weren't an eye witness 
at the crime spot.

406
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,880
You didn't see anything.

407
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,000
Your Honour, 
only a short while ago...

408
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,560
...Ramar claimed Jothi wasn't able 
to see him through the heavy mist.

409
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,320
But how could Ramar have seen Jothi 
through that same thick mist?

410
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,520
Instead of 1000 evidences providing proof

411
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,560
...being present at the crime spot 
and turning up as eye witness in court...

412
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,040
...is very important.

413
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,880
But in this case,

414
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,160
...even that witness is a false witness!

415
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,680
There has been many such 
discrepancies in Jothi's case.

416
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,200
Police didn't interrogate the witnesses 
or investigate the evidence in this case.

417
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,440
They just created them!

418
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,920
My next question...

419
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,120
Jothi fired at the policemen with 
the country-made gun in her possession.

420
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,240
She tried to escape and was 
therefore killed in a police encounter!

421
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,400
Alright the fact she had a country gun 
is mentioned only in the FIR papers.

422
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,160
The police did not furnish 
the details of the gun.

423
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,840
So I need to interrogate the police team 
which handled this case Your Honour.

424
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,680
Your Honour, we need time to collect details 
of the objects used in this case.

425
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,440
What is this sir? 
Giving excuses like a school kid!

426
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,840
When you appear 
in a criminal case like this...

427
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,520
...don't you have to collect 
the corresponding details?

428
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,440
In the next hearing you must submit 
all the details pertaining to this pistol.

429
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,280
All the concerned police officials 
should be present in the next hearing!

430
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,360
Okay sir.

431
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,240
Who thought a 15 year old case 
will be raked up now?'

432
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,840
Next hearing is on the third.'

433
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,240
The court is adjourned!'

434
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,400
My golden moon, true blue. 
My dreams dazzle around you.

435
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,400
Comfort soothing my mind anew, 
Embracing me day and night too.

436
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,120
[humming a song from 'Moodu Pani']

437
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,920
-Fish fry? 
-Yes sir!

438
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,880
Have you made it extra-spicy?

439
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,240
Very good... very good!

440
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,440
I'll be back now.

441
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,240
Why do you look so shocked da?

442
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:46,360
Hey! How many times have I told you not to 
guzzle down booze like a bloated buffalo?

443
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,160
What can I do da?

444
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,880
In this cold weather 
the moment I saw it...

445
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,040
...my hands involuntarily downed the glass.

446
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,920
You are incorrigible da.

447
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,040
Cheers!

448
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,360
Karpooram, if not for this whiskey and you...

449
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,600
...I would have been a judge all my life.

450
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,480
Got fed up and went to my grave!

451
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,120
Right from our school days 
you love wallowing in self pity.

452
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,120
What is lacking in your life now?

453
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,120
You are the judge for this Government!

454
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,840
Don't add fuel to the fire.

455
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,720
I've fixed my daughter's wedding 
in one month from now.

456
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,800
As the gap for the due date lessens, 
my finances are dwindling too.

457
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,040
At this point in time 
such a case crops up!

458
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,640
I thought only cash crunch is a problem.

459
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,680
Even this case is complicated!

460
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,040
Wanting to be an honest judge, 
you didn't get lured by deals.

461
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,840
You don't know how to have 
your palms greased on the sly either.

462
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,080
If you stick to your principles, 
how will your family respect you?

463
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,440
Don't be silly!

464
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,520
One day you'll understand 
the true value of being honest!

465
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,760
Okay dude I'm going home huh?

466
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,720
Hey! Wait! You may trip 
and fall in some ditch.

467
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,920
Then who will face your wife's fury?

468
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,080
Felicitating advocate Rajarathinam for 
10 years of name, fame and more to come!'

469
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
Sir, Mr. Varadarajan has arrived.'

470
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,680
-Hi sir. Welcome! 
-Vanakkam.

471
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,080
Such a pleasant surprise.

472
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,640
It is only appropriate to come and 
wish in person for such milestones.

473
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,560
Thank you!

474
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,280
Why do you seem so dull sir?

475
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,920
Though I'm blessed with everything,

476
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,520
...I feel empty as if I have nothing.

477
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,480
All this authority and affluence,

478
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,840
...what is the point of being so blessed?

479
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,960
My wife has passed away.

480
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
My son who was my world, 
has joined her too.

481
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,840
I forced myself to move on in life.

482
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,880
I thought I'll help people 
to the best of my ability till I die.

483
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,440
I have a new entrant 
shattering my peace.

484
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,120
This case...

485
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,360
Are you disturbed 
because of this case?

486
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,120
-Rathinam! 
-Sir?

487
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,320
I need to talk to you alone.

488
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,400
Sure!

489
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,400
Rathinam!

490
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,760
I'm not used to asking anyone any favor...

491
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,040
Here sir.

492
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,200
You must finish this deal for me.

493
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,240
What is this sir?

494
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,960
Go home, take rest... 
I'll take care.

495
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,120
Thank you.

496
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,960
Go to Mr. Varadarajan's office tomorrow.

497
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,080
Collect the files related to this case.

498
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,600
Send me the phone number of Alexander 
who is handling this case.

499
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,280
-Why are you looking at me weirdly? 
-I haven't seen you so submissive!

500
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,960
We have more important cases than this.

501
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,400
-That's why... 
-Listen!

502
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,360
We can depose people in power.

503
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,520
But we should never oppose 
those who create power for personal gain.

504
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,160
He didn't come begging me 
to bag this case.

505
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,280
He insisted I'm the only one 
who can handle it.

506
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,520
If I'm more than willing...

507
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:35,120
...it means we will hit 
the jackpot in this case!

508
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,920
Like this!

509
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,960
Golden opportunity!

510
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,000
Shameless Shylock court owner! 
Pay and then help yourself to a bun.'

511
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,520
I am a land owner of repute.

512
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,800
And you treat me like a lazy lout!

513
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,640
First, let me win this case.

514
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,400
I'll evict you!

515
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,080
Then I'll eliminate this court.

516
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,120
-Vanakkam sir. 
-Hello uncle.

517
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,240
Greetings!

518
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,680
-Sir tea? 
-Forget the tea!

519
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,880
What is this 'fly master'?

520
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,560
As usual court owner is creating a scene 
claiming this land belongs to him?

521
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,440
Hit the nail on the head! 
Please be my guest.

522
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,160
Listen to me Zameen...

523
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,480
Our entire nation is dependent on the court.

524
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,680
From cow-catching case 
to convicting liquor barons.

525
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,480
Celebrity or nonentity, 
he or she has to come here.

526
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,760
That being the case,

527
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,120
...if you roam around threatening to 
evict the court or evacuate our airport...

528
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,880
...I'll submit a petition claiming 
to be one of the heirs of this land.

529
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,760
In the psycho Jothi's case 
which has created quite a stir,'

530
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,200
...private audio of Public Prosecutor 
in Ooty was leaked online.'

531
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,800
And he has been dismissed from his post.'

532
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,520
District collector has replaced him 
with the renowned lawyer,'

533
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,280
Rajarathinam from the Chennai High court.'

534
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,280
Hammer nailing your head huh?

535
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,200
My mind is so disturbed pa.

536
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,480
Is it because Rajarathinam 
will be handling this case?

537
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,640
No pa.

538
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,840
People in high posts are shuffled 
like a pack of cards.

539
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,440
Only because they are loaded 
with money and might, right?

540
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,760
We got into this case 
with our eyes wide open.

541
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,400
We dived in with good faith.

542
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,720
We can face it!

543
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,800
But bear this in mind,

544
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,600
...Rajarathinam will try to maneuver it 
in any direction just to win this case.

545
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,960
You must be very careful...

546
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,800
...because this is our first and last chance.

547
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,360
I understand.

548
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,640
This is 1 out of a 100 cases for him.

549
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,960
But all these years,

550
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,240
...I was waiting 
only for this one case.

551
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,560
But,

552
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,680
...he should never 
find out our strength pa.

553
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,200
Don't worry about that dear.

554
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,560
I'll take care.

555
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,280
Looks like a thunder storm will hit us.

556
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,160
Amma will be waiting to eat with us.

557
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,440
Let's go home.

558
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,320
Sir, please separate me from my wife. 
I can't take her torture any longer!

559
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,120
[overlap of eager voices]

560
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,080
Sir, come!

561
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,040
Please be calm. 
Move aside!

562
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,720
Come here sir.

563
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,840
Give him way.

564
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
Hi sir.

565
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,560
Sir just one selfie, please.

566
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,360
I'm a die-hard fan of yours.

567
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,000
Sir I'll post it on Facebook and tag you.

568
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,520
The other day you said it's a sin to 
sit or stand next to someone like me!

569
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,480
Have you come today to take notes 
on how my daughter excels as a lawyer?

570
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,240
Hello Mr Rajarathinam. 
How are you?

571
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,760
I'm fine. How are you?

572
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,000
I'm doing good.

573
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,560
Okay Rajarathinam sir.

574
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,520
In the last hearing, 
Venba had asked for certain details...

575
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,160
I'm sure you'll be 
familiar with the case.

576
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,240
Yes sir.

577
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,880
-You can proceed. 
-Thank you sir!

578
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,720
So I think I've come 
to take up this crucial case...

579
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,840
...at the most critical time.

580
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,720
If I had been negligent 
even for a nano second,

581
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,360
...our advocate would have passed off 
criminal Jothi as Mother Teresa's cousin!

582
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:19,040
Usually we take an oath from the witness, 
promising to speak only the truth.

583
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,200
But not even once have advocates 
like us taken any oath.

584
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,480
So for the first time, I think I should ask 
the defence lawyer to take such an oath.

585
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,800
First eye witness, Ramar!

586
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,040
Poor man! He narrated then 
what he witnessed truthfully.

587
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,440
Reiterated it now too.

588
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,600
Honest man!

589
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,880
She has shown a stamp sized photo 
as if it is a historic piece of evidence!

590
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,560
Photo is original. 
It wasn't taken on the 5th...

591
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,960
...but on May 3rd!

592
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,560
Mr Ramamurthy won that year 
in the Parliament election.

593
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,680
His birthday and his electoral victory 
were both celebrated on the same day!

594
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,240
That photo which was taken on the 3rd 
was published in the papers on the 5th!

595
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,360
-Your Honour. 
-Please sit!

596
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,040
I know what you want to say.

597
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,120
You'll say this was taken 
only on the 5th, correct?

598
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,280
Your Honour...

599
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,000
Murugan who is standing 
next to Ramar in this photo,

600
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,200
...died after meeting his leader 
in an accident on the night of May 3rd!

601
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,960
His wife is here as witness.

602
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,600
Vanakkam sir.

603
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,960
This is Murugan's death certificate.

604
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,040
So Your Honour like Venba madam claims, 
if this photo was taken on the 5th...

605
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,520
...then only Murugan's ghost 
must have posed for the camera.

606
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,240
I state this with all humility.

607
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,720
The next thing...

608
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,640
The gun used by Jothi.

609
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,920
In a fire accident in 2007,

610
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,560
...all the important documents were 
destroyed in the police station in Ooty.

611
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,760
That case is also being 
handled by this court.

612
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,640
Our defense lawyer who knew 
all these details in detail,

613
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,400
...had raised it as a major doubt.

614
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,240
She has also used it 
to her advantage in this case...

615
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,040
..including the missing documents 
during the fire accident in the station.

616
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,280
Venba, any objection?

617
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,400
No Your Honour!

618
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,040
I would like to interrogate 
the inspector who handled this case,

619
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,920
...who is the current DSP Mr. Alexander!

620
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,160
Okay, proceed.

621
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,760
Vanakkam sir.

622
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,600
The night of May 6th...

623
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,280
...were you the one who arrested Jothi 
at Tiruppur railway station?

624
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,560
Yes I did along with my team.

625
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,200
We searched day and night, 
Finally arrested her in Tiruppur.

626
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,440
How long will it take to travel 
from Ooty to Tiruppur?

627
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,040
Three and a half hours!

628
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,320
How did you get the information 
Jothi intended to escape from Tiruppur?

629
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,880
Highly confidential madam.

630
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,080
Department secret.

631
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,760
I can't share it in public.

632
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,760
A criminal who is being hunted 
by the police all over the town!

633
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,520
How could she have travelled from Ooty 
to Tiruppur without anyone noticing her?

634
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,680
We were searching for her 
in every nook and cranny.

635
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,960
Her strength was to mingle 
with the people and be nondescript.

636
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,920
Actually criminals think 
more intelligently than us madam.

637
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,360
Do you have the habit of 
watching super hero movies, sir?

638
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,720
I'm a police officer madam.

639
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,720
I don't believe in super heroes, 
I have faith only in reality.

640
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,040
But reality is missing in the way 
you dealt with this case, sir!

641
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,400
When you arrest a lady, 
you must take a lady constable.

642
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,080
Why didn't you?

643
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,000
A lady constable was not 
available in the station that day.

644
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,360
We had to arrest the accused at once.

645
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,600
Time was running short.

646
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,560
-So we left immediately! 
-Forget that.

647
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,760
What time did you arrest Jothi? 
Where did you get her confession?

648
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,960
Any photo or video evidence 
that she confessed?

649
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,280
Why haven't you added 
anything in your documents?

650
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,640
You know, actually madam...

651
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,960
...if creative juices overflow 
in your mind, go and write a novel.

652
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,320
Instead don't ask me 
such silly questions.

653
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,680
Haven't you written in Jothi's case?

654
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,080
A novel!

655
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,040
I certainly can't make it 
as spicy as yours.

656
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,240
Stick to only replying 
to my questions.

657
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,640
Objection Your Honour!

658
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,920
Isn't this the first case 
for our defense lawyer?

659
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,240
That's why she is treating 
everyone like a criminal!

660
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,560
After knowing a child 
is struggling for her life,

661
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,200
...is it possible to follow procedures 
the way she expects?

662
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,040
We didn't have mobiles then 
to shoot videos in the blink of an eye.

663
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,560
A photographer from the department had 
to come to click a photo or shoot a video.

664
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,080
We didn't have enough time either.

665
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,360
So they took Jothi's confession 
as a written statement.

666
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,160
No point asking unnecessary questions 
and wasting time Your Honour.

667
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,800
This is a very sensitive case.'

668
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,880
You have seen the video related to 
Jothi's case innumerable times,

669
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,920
...I ask the court's permission to play 
that video once more today.

670
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,320
Proceed!

671
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,280
Madam do you know 
whom you are supporting?'

672
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,360
A North Indian psycho killer who kidnapped 
and killed innocent children heartlessly!

673
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,400
If his team had missed nabbing her, 
she would have killed...

674
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,280
...so many more children 
in many more towns.

675
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,520
Miss Venba...

676
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,240
...you reopened this case.

677
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,720
In the next hearing,

678
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,200
...I want you to produce proper evidence 
if you have like Mr. Rajarathinam did.

679
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:10,080
Instead of disrespecting higher officials 
in the name of questioning them.

680
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,520
I'll be forced to dismiss the case. 
Next hearing, day after tomorrow!

681
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,560
Court is adjourned!

682
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,840
Come here woman.

683
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,440
You did a good job. 
Here's your payment.

684
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,440
-How can you pay me so less? 
-I'll compensate next time.

685
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,920
Super! You rocked sir. 
Different level altogether!

686
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,040
You are the best lawyer in the world sir.

687
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,840
Something is fishy!

688
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,280
Collect all the details 
about her asap.

689
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,480
Okay sir!

690
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,320
Why did you come away 
without presenting your counter?

691
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,960
Rajarathinam is trying to play his game 
using me as his pawn!

692
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,680
[flurry of voices]

693
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,520
What I say? 
No, thank you!

694
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,480
You there! 
She was my only child.

695
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,720
Killed at a tender age of 10.

696
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,680
And you are defending 
such a cruel psycho killer?

697
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,000
How can you have the heart? 
Are you even human?

698
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,240
I've been suffering for 15 years.

699
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,200
-Unable to forget my child. 
-Stop hassling her.

700
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,200
-Come away Venba. 
-You are just a gold digger!

701
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,400
-How will you feel a mother's pain? 
-Don't look back!

702
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,800
I curse you bitterly 
with all my pain and anguish.

703
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,520
May you rot in hell!

704
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,360
You are just a gold digger. 
How will you feel my pain?'

705
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,360
Damn you! My curse 
will make you a corpse!'

706
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,200
Venba!

707
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,920
Venba are you still thinking 
about that female's rant?

708
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:45,240
So many people have maligned us 
ever since we reopened this case.

709
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,080
They have hit us below the belt, 
I've even been targeted with a slipper!

710
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,600
I wasn't affected one bit.

711
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,520
But that mother's anguished wails...

712
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,600
...I can't take it casually 
just like that pa!

713
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,320
Hurts like hell!

714
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,760
Venba aren't you fighting this case 
for that woman's tears too?

715
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,400
It will only get worse. 
They will hurt you, humiliate you!

716
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,520
They will even stab you 
or tear the case to pieces.

717
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:19,680
But if you compare it to Jothi's journey, 
all this is child's play my dear.

718
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,960
This is her diary!

719
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,360
I know you've read it 
more than a 100 times.

720
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,600
Still... for my sake, 
go through it once more!

721
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,000
Think you are the Jothi who wrote this.

722
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:37,920
When you personalize an experience 
only then you feel the depth of that pain.

723
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,200
Venba, don't think you are 
fighting this cause for Jothi.

724
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,400
Think you are in Jothi's shoes and fight!

725
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,280
Only then your heart 
will strengthen even more.

726
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,200
No one can defeat you.

727
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,600
Take this!

728
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,360
In life people wish their minds to fly 
flapping their wings free in the azure sky.'

729
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,920
My mind too shared the same thought.'

730
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,640
He walked into my life, my idol... 
to make my wings sprout and soar high.'

731
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,680
He and his love for me made me believe 
even men can be angels, messengers of God.'

732
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,400
A fresh start with 
a new ray of hope in my heart.'

733
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,440
My life was wrapped in happiness.'

734
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,600
But it was short lived. 
Just six months.'

735
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,960
In the name of honor killing 
they killed my husband in front of my eyes.'

736
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:32,840
In a life blanketed in darkness 
I restarted my journey, this time alone...'

737
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,040
...for the other angel in my life!'

738
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,720
[baby crying]

739
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:46,920
Welcome to this world, my princess 
Present in my life; my bud so precious!

740
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:53,440
You nurtured my motherliness 
Made me blossom with eagerness!

741
00:42:53,960 --> 00:43:00,760
I will give my life as milk 
anytime you want to drink!

742
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:06,560
My hands are your anchor of safety 
when you want to swim, my sweetie!

743
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:13,640
A million eyes won't suffice 
to admire your rose-bud face!

744
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:21,000
Palm of my hands too small, my love 
to rock this blessing from above!

745
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:27,320
A hundred rainbows won't do 
to paint a masterpiece like you!

746
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:34,640
Your baby scent, sweet and lingering 
That is enough, come to me, my darling!

747
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:55,240
Your smile made me take my 1st step 
with a baby push-walker so adept!

748
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:02,320
Your eyes like snowflakes and drops of dew 
Made me smile through teary-eyes anew!

749
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:09,040
You mimicked and made a funny face 
You melted me in your warm embrace!

750
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:16,280
On every path I loved to play 
You showered happiness on the way!

751
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,640
You are the light of my life for eternity.

752
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,680
I am your guardian angel in totality.

753
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:28,520
My festoon decorating my days 
Only reason for my life always!

754
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,480
This is the contact details 
of Pethuraj in Tamil Nadu.

755
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,720
Go and meet him!

756
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,880
Why are you looking so sad ma?

757
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,200
Your grandparents are selling this house 
and shifting to another city with their son!

758
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,920
We are moving to a new city?

759
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,400
I'm there for you. 
I'll take good care of you!

760
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,920
My darling princess!

761
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,200
Sit on my lap.

762
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,240
Study well.

763
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,000
-Godspeed dear. 
-Bye grandma!

764
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:15,000
Let us set forth on our journey.

765
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:22,480
To find our homeland; our family tree!

766
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:27,920
To stem into new routes, steady.

767
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:35,400
Only I am your root, my little lady!

768
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:42,760
You are everything for me always!

769
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,920
Only you sparked my life in all ways!

770
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,560
I am your mother, always by your side. 
Also your father as your friend and guide!

771
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:03,480
I am your path to victory 
My dearest crowning glory!

772
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:10,120
In the azure blue sky 
let us spread our wings to fly!

773
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:16,560
Your beacon of light I will be!

774
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:25,320
My heart-beat, my sanctuary!

775
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,480
Past few days 
in Nilgiris district...'

776
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,640
...the sudden escalation 
in child-kidnapping cases.'

777
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,440
'Parents have been cautioned to 
keep a close watch on their children.'

778
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,360
'By senior police official.'

779
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:37,800
I will be your sky with sunshine bright!

780
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:44,520
Protect you from pain however slight!

781
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:51,600
I will gladly be your best friend!

782
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:58,080
Tick your wish-list till the very end!

783
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:05,840
A chariot without my idol am I 
Parched land, desolate and dry.

784
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:12,320
Is my language fluent or do I falter? 
Who am I here, my dear daughter?

785
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,960
Trees flower; springtime beauty.

786
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,320
Colors add to nature's bounty.

787
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:26,000
My boon, blessing, felicity 
You mean the world to me.

788
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:32,880
My precious princess heavenly!

789
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,440
-'Rehta tha' 
-Raghu thatha!

790
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,520
In Hindi 'Rehta tha' means 'he lived'!

791
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,760
-'Raha thatha'. 
-'Thatha' is grandpa in Tamil!

792
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,320
Pethuraj sir has enrolled Pappu 
in a school. We are happy here.'

793
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,360
He went to Chennai and 
came back with his wife!'

794
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,920
Venba!

795
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,320
It's getting late. 
We need to be in court!

796
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,080
-Come in and get ready. 
-Coming pa.

797
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,200
Your Honour regarding Jothi 
accused as 'accused' in this case.

798
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,600
Ever since he took over the case,

799
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,240
...Rajarathinam sir has been 
emphasizing a fact many times.

800
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,120
Jothi is a kidnapper from North India.

801
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:22,760
The police official handling this case 
mentioned a child kidnapped in Jaipur.

802
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,960
But I am stating this fact, 
Jothi is not a North Indian.

803
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,920
What! Do you realize 
what you are saying?

804
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,960
The whole world knows 
she is a murderer from North India.

805
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,040
Do you have any evidence 
to substantiate your statement?

806
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,360
Of course sir.

807
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,600
I have evidence Your Honour.

808
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,480
When a criminal can't be nabbed 
to close a case easily,

809
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,880
...branding it as North Indian conspiracy...

810
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,240
...has become the norm 
for some police officials.

811
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:51,440
People naturally resent it when they hear 
of a North Indian involvement.

812
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:56,440
Tamilian Jothi was branded a North Indian 
to intensify people's hatred against her.

813
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,680
To prove my deduction,

814
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,800
...I request the court to allow me to 
interrogate Selvi as my next witness.

815
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,680
Sir. How can this be allowed 
without a pre-intimation letter?

816
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,640
I think you became a lawyer 
watching court scenes in movies!

817
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,520
According to Section #311 anyone can be 
called as witness once they attend court.

818
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,840
Vanakkam sir.

819
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,880
Disclose your details.

820
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,400
I am Selvi madam!

821
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,200
My hometown is Melur near Madurai.

822
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,440
My husband's name is Ramalingam!

823
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,840
We have two sons.

824
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,880
Our son Duraipandi lives 
with his family in Madurai.

825
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,280
Our daughter is Sakthijothi.

826
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,480
We call her fondly as Jothi.

827
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,400
Who is Jothi?

828
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,440
Tell the court what happened to her.

829
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,480
What can I say?

830
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,240
So happy we raised our first born daughter 
with so much love.

831
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,960
When she was a student, she fell in love 
with a boy from another caste.

832
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,560
And eloped with him.

833
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,840
My husband and people 
of our caste didn't forgive them.

834
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,800
They are prepared to give up anything.

835
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,640
But for no reason will they 
make compromises on caste.

836
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,600
One day when that boy was 
returning home from work,

837
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,920
...under the guise of 'honor killing', 
they killed him ruthlessly.

838
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,480
They went in search of my daughter 
with the same fervor to kill her!

839
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,640
I thought they must have succeeded.

840
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,680
Only now I realize she has escaped.

841
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,200
Year 2004!

842
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,800
A lady by name Jothi.

843
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,840
News about her kidnapping children 
and killing them was the talk of the town!

844
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,880
Aren't you aware of 
anything regarding that?

845
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,560
After my daughter-in-law 
threw me out of the house,

846
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,520
...I had no option but to reside in 
a religious mutt in Vedaranyam.

847
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,560
A monastic life between four walls.

848
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,040
I got to know the details from you 
only after I came here today.

849
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,880
Your Honour, Jothi who was 
declared to be a North Indian...

850
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:45,080
...is the daughter of Selvi and Ramalingam, 
a couple whose roots are of Tamil origin.

851
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:48,560
Rajarathinam sir, you can now 
cross examine the witness!

852
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,840
Thank you sir!

853
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,480
What is your daughter's full name?

854
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,520
Sakthijothi!

855
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,440
Doesn't she have an initial or surname?

856
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,480
Doesn't matter, do you have 
at least a photo of her?

857
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:04,720
They burnt all her belongings 
the day she eloped sir.

858
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,960
You'll bombard us with 101 questions about 
the archive that really got burnt down.

859
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,720
Should I believe this lie now?

860
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,040
You shared a lot of details 
about your family history.

861
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,120
But you didn't elaborate 
about Jothi's childhood?

862
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,600
A girl with a golden heart sir!

863
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,040
She won't dream of hurting even a fly sir.

864
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,280
Your daughter Sakthijothi, who would 
never dream of hurting even a fly,

865
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:29,000
...went into flight mode as 
a child kidnapper and killer apparently.

866
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,600
She isn't that kind of girl sir.

867
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,160
But society believes she was 
a heartless kidnapper and killer.

868
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,680
My daughter is not a heartless human being. 
I am sure that is a fabrication sir.

869
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,880
Maybe it is someone else sir.

870
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,480
Please don't cry.

871
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,280
That's all Your Honour!

872
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,120
Their own witness is refuting it.

873
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,320
Poor soul!

874
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:51,360
Imagine summoning a lady as witness 
who has gone through so much trauma.

875
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,600
And using a mother's anguish 
to her selfish advantage.

876
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,560
Jothi of this case could be Jothi Patel.

877
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,680
Jothi Agarwal or even Jothi Kapoor.

878
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,840
But that Jothi is NOT Sakthijothi!

879
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,600
In the court of law I know very well 
you'll insist evidence is important sir.

880
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:11,520
To prove Sakthijothi 
is the Jothi in this case.

881
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,880
As my next witness, I would like you 
to permit me to interrogate Mr. Pethuraj.

882
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,720
Is the time now 4:20?

883
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,920
Like our IPC Section 420 on cheating 
another fraud as witness to nail a cheat!

884
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,240
Mr. Rajarathinam...

885
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,600
...if a criminal like you 
can defend a criminal case...

886
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,800
...why can't I be the witness 
for a fraudulent case?

887
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,920
[mocking laughter]

888
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,200
Did you notice the reaction?

889
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,320
Silence!

890
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,280
Pethuraj whatever you want to say, 
come here and speak up.

891
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,160
Speak up sir!

892
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,640
Do you know the accused Jothi in this case?

893
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,240
I knew her very well.

894
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,040
Your Honour, I hail from Ooty.

895
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,800
I travel often to Chennai 
for business reasons.

896
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,560
I got acquainted with a client 
in one of those trips.

897
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,400
He belongs to Jaipur.

898
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,760
He told me Jothi was working 
in his house in Jaipur.

899
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:00,400
She had to return to Tamil Nadu 
due to unforeseen circumstances.'

900
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,400
He asked me to help him then!'

901
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,320
That was how Jothi came here.

902
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,680
Later while talking to her, I came to know...

903
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,000
...she lost her husband to 
the cruel custom of 'honor killing'.

904
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,760
Because she was pregnant then,

905
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:17,840
...with the sole intention of saving her baby, 
she had no other go but to leave this city.

906
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,200
And that was how she landed in Jaipur.

907
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:26,160
Other than that she is not a North Indian 
as specified in the police records!

908
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,080
She is a Tamilian by birth.

909
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,080
I got her a job as accountant in Ooty.

910
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,960
I got her daughter enrolled in a school.

911
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:39,600
I arranged a place to stay 
close to my residence.

912
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,160
She has the necessary evidence 
for whatever I stated now!

913
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,880
I have also attached her diary 
along with this Your Honour.'

914
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,960
So, Mr Pethuraj...

915
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,080
If it is true you helped Jothi in Ooty 
on grounds of generosity and humanity,

916
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,080
...where were you on the day 
Jothi was killed in a police encounter?

917
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,280
Why didn't you confess 
to the police on the same day?

918
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,760
So you are a partner 
in the crime connived by Jothi.

919
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,360
You have a major share in it too. 
Am I right?

920
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,320
Don't be hasty! Rajarathinam and 
I haven't finished as yet.

921
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,080
Your Honour!

922
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,840
4th of May, 2004.

923
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:24,240
That was the day before Rohith 
and Diwakar were shot dead by Jothi.

924
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:28,840
Let me tell you a first person account 
of what transpired in front of my eyes.

925
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,800
I was reading the newspaper that evening 
in front of my house like I always do.'

926
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,440
Jothi's daughter was playing there 
riding her bicycle.'

927
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:43,320
At that time I saw 
a yellow car cross my house.'

928
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:48,960
I continued reading wondering about 
the new car that whizzed past my house.'

929
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,920
I heard a child screaming out 'amma' 
suddenly out of the blue.'

930
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,200
Flustered. I got up to check'.

931
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,000
I ran out and saw.'

932
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,960
Jothi was running behind that yellow car.'

933
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:05,440
Two youngsters in the car were dragging 
that child forcibly into it.'

934
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,080
'The car gathered speed.'

935
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,840
-'We were both running...' 
-Stop it!

936
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,680
You spun a good yarn, Pethuraj.

937
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,720
Jothi's kid was playing outside it seems. 
A yellow car sped past at that time.

938
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,720
On top of all this, it was Rohith's car 
and the child was kidnapped in it.

939
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,720
They chased that car it seems 
but it gathered speed and vanished.

940
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,520
No use spinning unbelievable tales 
to create sympathy.

941
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,120
Court needs evidence!

942
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,320
Proper evidence!

943
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,520
We are not stating anything 
without proper evidence, Your Honour.

944
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,960
I have the required proof.

945
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:34,920
I request you to grant me permission to 
play the second video linked with Jothi's case.

946
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,000
Stop!

947
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,760
Notice this point, Your Honour.

948
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:43,120
There's a difference between kidnapping 
and saving a child being kidnapped.

949
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,080
Jothi did not kidnap that child.

950
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,480
She was saving the kid!

951
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:47,640
Utterly kiddish!

952
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:51,960
If you remove your school uniform and wear 
a lawyer's coat this will be the outcome.

953
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,920
You yell out 'Stop it' when the face 
is so blurred in that video.

954
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,480
And you blabber like an idiot 
she was saving instead of kidnapping!

955
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:02,120
You accused Jothi of being the criminal 
with this video with the same blurred face!

956
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,040
Your Honour...

957
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:09,000
Jothi didn't express the fury 
of a kidnapper or killer...

958
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,760
...but a mother's unconditional love.

959
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:16,120
The child Jothi allegedly kidnapped 
with this video as important evidence is...

960
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,320
Jothi's own child.

961
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,080
A mother was trying to save her own blood.

962
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,240
How can she be accused of 
cold blooded abduction?

963
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,560
Will you please stop it?

964
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,520
You are preaching as if you were 
an eye witness at the crime spot?

965
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,760
Oh! Maybe you are confident a dead child 
can't rise from the grave to contradict!

966
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,720
Who said that child is dead?

967
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,320
She is very much alive.

968
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,680
Yes sir, I was an eye witness 
at the crime scene.

969
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,840
I am the only person who witnessed 
the entire traumatic event.

970
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,240
Because you see...

971
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,640
...I am that kidnapped child!

972
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,040
The woman you branded 
as a psycho killer,

973
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,960
...Sathyajothi's daughter.

974
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,200
Jothi

975
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,560
...is my mother!

976
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,720
When people assumed 
Venba was Pethuraj's daughter,'

977
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,440
...she claims to be Jothi's daughter.'

978
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,520
This is trending everywhere. 
What do you think of this news?

979
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,240
Be quiet bro.'

980
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,560
Renowned advocate Rajarathinam taking up 
this case without knowing the basic facts,'

981
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:37,080
...is considered a sacrilege 
according to senior advocates.'

982
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,840
[phone ringing]

983
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,680
Good morning sir!

984
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,800
[phone ringing continues]

985
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,000
Sir, Varadarajan sir is calling you, sir.

986
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,160
Let him call sir.

987
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,000
Why are you getting flustered sir?

988
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,040
Am I not the one paying you sir?

989
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,000
Reserve your 'sir' only for me and 
press the silent mode on my phone!

990
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,760
-Now come and serve. 
-Okay sir.

991
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,040
What is the update?

992
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:14,400
I checked Venba's proof and documents 
of her last hearing thoroughly sir.

993
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:18,200
Be it Venba's school admission certificate 
or her mother Jothi's signature...

994
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,880
...everything is in order sir!

995
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,640
100% true Venba is Jothi's daughter!

996
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:26,360
After Jothi's demise, 
Petharaj raised Venba.

997
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,960
He isn't her biological father.

998
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,640
Sir, they recovered a child's body 
from an old building in 2004 right?

999
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,440
That girl child is Angel sir.

1000
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:36,600
She was from an orphanage and during 
an excursion to Ooty, she went missing.

1001
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:41,880
The Father in charge of the orphanage 
filed a complaint on the very same day.

1002
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,720
But the police lost 
that FIR complaint sir.'

1003
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,240
Sir if you don't get me wrong...

1004
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,480
So what if I do?

1005
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,320
Rohith and his friend Diwakar are frauds.

1006
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,080
Varadarajan hid many facts from me...

1007
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,440
-That's your point? 
-Yes sir!

1008
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,840
Get back to serving me!

1009
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,680
Good morning sir.

1010
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,800
-Does it hurt? 
-Yes sir.

1011
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,480
You should be careful while playing.

1012
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,920
Sir, Mr. Rajarathinam is here!

1013
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,160
Hello Rajarathinam.

1014
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,640
Why are you looking at the ground?

1015
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,040
Huh!

1016
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,600
You think your deeds deserve 
a direct look in your eyes?

1017
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:26,280
I took up this case without any questions 
because I held you in high respect.

1018
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,640
Why did you hide the facts from me sir?

1019
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,640
-Get some snacks. 
-Okay sir.

1020
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:35,760
What fact did I hide?

1021
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,920
She asked about the gun.

1022
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,200
Didn't I tell you I am responsible 
for that gun right in the beginning?

1023
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,720
Who the hell knew?

1024
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,760
Out of the blue she will claim 
to be Jothi's daughter?

1025
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,280
If I had known I would have 
told you from A to Z the other day!

1026
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,800
How can you be so flippant 
about their heinous crimes?

1027
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,320
You said she shot your son 
when he tried to save the child.

1028
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,400
But your son?

1029
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,080
Go ahead man, 
complete your sentence.

1030
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,160
You were unable to right?

1031
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,320
What to do?

1032
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,120
He is my son after all.

1033
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:12,400
That's probably why I am washing 
my hands for the sins of his past.

1034
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:16,520
You know how our society 
has put me on a high pedestal!

1035
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:20,480
I want to ensure my good reputation 
is not tarnished till my last breath.

1036
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,280
I will safeguard that reputation.

1037
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,360
Sir if you tell your doctor you have piles 
feeling ashamed to say you have AIDS,

1038
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,000
...you will be treated accordingly.

1039
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:34,000
You should have bared your soul 
when you asked me to take up this case.

1040
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,760
Instead if you want me to get 
a martyr's award for your son and you!

1041
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,560
-How is it possible? 
-Rathinam!

1042
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,640
Dismissing the public prosecutor 
I had you assigned to this case...

1043
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,560
...not for you to question me!

1044
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,120
Were you defending Gandhi 
and Kamaraj earlier, huh?

1045
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:52,640
You defended criminals 90/99 of your cases.

1046
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,160
100% true sir!

1047
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:58,120
But unlike you, those 90 clients 
were completely honest with me.

1048
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,160
After claiming to be Jothi's daughter,

1049
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,720
...it wouldn't have taken long for Venba 
to pin the crime on your son and his friend.

1050
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:08,200
Reason she was silent these 15 years,

1051
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,760
...was to speak when people were 
willing to lend an ear.

1052
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:16,720
That half-baked petty lawyer Petharaj 
has drafted a neat screenplay for this case.

1053
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:28,040
Rathinam I was apprehensive. You may 
reject this case if I was upfront with you.'

1054
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,760
I didn't come clean.'

1055
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,720
All facts about this case 
will be at your doorstep tonight.'

1056
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,720
Jothi is my mother.'

1057
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,640
Rathinam I need to 
talk to you in private.'

1058
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:41,880
That gun is mine.'

1059
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,840
Sir, Venba has announced in court 
she is Jothi's daughter.'

1060
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:48,120
Looks like she will win this case.'

1061
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,600
She has some ace up her sleeve 
as evidence sir.

1062
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Hi sir.

1063
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,360
-Take a seat. 
-Thanks.

1064
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,760
-What would you like to have? 
-Nothing, I'm good.

1065
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,800
Rewind. Tell me what happened.

1066
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:17,920
Sir, based on Jothi's information 
we went with a dog squad to Lovedale.

1067
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,880
When the bungalow was searched thoroughly,

1068
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:25,600
...we obtained the information 
those lads frequent that place.

1069
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:34,240
[dog barking]

1070
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,920
[dog growling]

1071
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:46,960
Dig here!'

1072
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,000
[dog barking]

1073
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,960
SIR!'

1074
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,840
Sir, come over here!'

1075
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,840
When we dug in front of the bungalow,'

1076
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,200
...we found the body of a girl child 
who has been dead for many days.'

1077
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,200
Sir come here. 
Please hurry up sir!'

1078
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,920
[dog barking]

1079
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,040
When we searched the backyard,'

1080
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,360
...we found the bodies of 4 girls 
in a decomposed state.'

1081
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,840
It was a cruel sight indeed.'

1082
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:03,120
Only then I realized those boys were 
so inhuman as to not even spare a dog!'

1083
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,960
Not knowing what to do, I narrated 
whatever they did to Varadarajan sir.'

1084
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,680
He sent a doctor over 
to camouflage the actual facts.'

1085
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:31,960
That doctor erased all the evidences 
of the lads raping those children.'

1086
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,600
He wiped their slate clean.'

1087
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:38,400
We made everyone believe 
Jothi had buried that child we unearthed.'

1088
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:41,840
The bodies of the 4 girls we dug out 
in that bungalow's backyard,'

1089
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,840
...we reburied in Jothi's backyard.'

1090
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:47,360
We fabricated that Jothi 
was the kidnapper and killer.'

1091
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,760
Where is the doctor now?

1092
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,600
The doctor has passed away!

1093
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,200
Those two dog squad officers?

1094
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:57,120
They were transferred 
to a different city immediately.

1095
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:02,720
Only the three of us know the whole truth.

1096
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,840
[automated message]

1097
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Cha!

1098
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,040
Rajarathinam sir...

1099
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,400
The documents submitted by Venba are in order.

1100
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,160
Do you have any objections?'

1101
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:28,560
No sir!

1102
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:33,280
Your Honour, what I've been trying to prove 
from the commencement of this case,

1103
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,440
...is that Alex sir and team did not go 
to Tiruppur to arrest Jothi.

1104
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:40,240
I could not proceed with my argument 
because of insufficient evidence.

1105
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:44,760
Now adequate evidence has been 
submitted about Jothi's nativity.

1106
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,960
So with your permission 
may I proceed with Alexander sir?

1107
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,960
Your Honour, police reports are 
the backbone of any case.

1108
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,960
Police department has to go through 
101 formalities to prepare them.

1109
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,880
Eyewitnesses need to be interrogated 
and all evidences have to be filed properly.

1110
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,520
But in this case alone, 
everything has been created.

1111
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,040
Do you remember this photo?

1112
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,520
Clicked in 2004 when people protested 
insisting on Jothi being arrested.

1113
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:18,600
Okay.

1114
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,560
Your Honour, if you scrutinize this photo...

1115
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:27,000
...the hands of the clock tower 
behind them point at 6:25.

1116
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,240
Alex sir was also there 
till that specified time.

1117
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,720
It takes 3 hours 30 minutes 
to travel from Ooty to Tiruppur.

1118
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,520
He was the one who told us 
in the last hearing.

1119
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,240
But according to police records,

1120
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,680
...I mean as per your records,

1121
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:41,160
...you arrested Jothi at 8:00 p.m.

1122
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,560
How could you have reached Tiruppur 
in 90 minutes then sir?

1123
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,880
Timely point!

1124
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,120
Please sit down sir.

1125
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:49,120
I know what you intend saying.'

1126
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,280
Time might have stopped 
on that clock tower?

1127
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:52,400
[mocking chuckle]

1128
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:57,720
It is the same time on the wrist of 
the reporter who interviewed the official.

1129
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:01,280
Even if he had flown,

1130
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,840
...no way he could have 
reached Tiruppur at 8:00 p.m.

1131
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:08,760
So, the fact that you arrested Jothi 
in Tiruppur turns out to be a lie.

1132
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,120
To save a child whose life was in danger,

1133
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,920
...how could you have gone 
with Jothi to that old bungalow?

1134
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,680
Jothi, who tried to escape 
from your clutches over there.

1135
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,640
How could you have shot her dead?

1136
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:24,280
Your Honour right from the arrest, 
including the police encounter is a lie.

1137
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,080
Complete fabrication.

1138
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,640
A Tamilian by birth has 
been branded a North Indian.

1139
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:31,480
She has been victimized 
as having kidnapped her own child.

1140
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,760
Why couldn't those two youngsters 
be the actual culprits?

1141
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:38,680
Maybe the police official framed 
the innocent Jothi to aid Varadarajan?

1142
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:39,880
Bravo!

1143
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,200
All along I thought 
this case was about Jothi.

1144
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:47,280
Only now I realize madam is trying 
to turn the tables on Mr. Varadarajan.

1145
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:48,520
Sit down!'

1146
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,600
Didn't you say so?

1147
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:52,080
Before saying that 
I stood up to tell you this.

1148
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,280
Now do you understand?

1149
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,440
Jothi was arrested only in Tiruppur.

1150
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:57,120
But Alexander didn't arrest her.

1151
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,000
The local police in Tiruppur did.

1152
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:03,680
Alexander hasn't mentioned it 
anywhere in this charge sheet!

1153
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:06,680
Jothi was shifted to 
the custody of the Ooty police.

1154
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,080
This is the report filed by Tiruppur police.

1155
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,960
His biggest mistake was losing 
the FIR filed on the missing children.

1156
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,480
No wonder all this confusion.

1157
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:17,920
In such a sensitive case thanks to 
a mistake like this by a police officer,

1158
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,320
...half baked lawyers like Venba appear.

1159
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,600
And support heartless murderers like Jothi!

1160
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,880
That's exactly why this court 
does not depend only on one department.

1161
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:28,560
Post mortem report by the doctor, 
forensic report and other records

1162
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,840
...maintained by the police are all true.

1163
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,240
There's nothing to change 
or contradict in this, Your Honour.

1164
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:34,440
Yes, Your Honour!

1165
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,400
Nothing more to 'change' 
in these records.

1166
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,800
Everything has already 
been tampered with.

1167
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,760
But there is one contradiction!

1168
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:45,320
Actually as shown in the police records, 
Mr. Alexander did not arrest Jothi.

1169
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:49,480
Tiruppur police didn't arrest her either 
as stated by Mr. Rajarathinam.

1170
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:52,480
Truth be told 
no one arrested Jothi.

1171
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:55,640
Jothi surrendered of her own volition,

1172
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,400
...to sub inspector Suresh Pandian 
who was on duty that day!

1173
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:03,080
After that, he was made 
invisible in this case.

1174
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:07,160
No! Your Honour madam is wrong 
about this alleged vanishing act.

1175
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:11,160
He had applied for a transfer 
two months before he handled this case.

1176
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:14,120
It was sanctioned and he was 
transferred and only one week later...

1177
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,200
He didn't ask for a transfer, Your Honour!

1178
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:19,400
Suresh Pandian is the only police officer 
who knows the truth behind this case.

1179
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,840
In order to prevent Suresh 
from being called upon as a witness,

1180
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,680
...as if he had nothing 
to do with this case,

1181
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:26,000
...the transfer was a move 
well planned by Alexander.

1182
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:28,680
Now, Suresh Pandian is 
an important witness in this case.

1183
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:32,120
You should permit him to be summoned 
for the next argument Your Honour.

1184
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:37,160
Your Honour I am wondering if our lawyer 
passed out of Law college or a crematorium!

1185
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,440
She keeps summoning witnesses 
from their graves!

1186
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:40,480
First Jothi!

1187
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:43,440
Then those two dog-squad officers. 
Finally, Suresh Pandian now!

1188
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:47,520
He committed suicide last night 
due to excess work pressure.

1189
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,760
Everybody in this department 
is aware of this tragedy.

1190
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,680
Suresh Pandian commits suicide 
due to excess workload.'

1191
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:57,120
Even now if you notice, 
as if unaware of his demise,'

1192
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:00,160
...her expression will be one of 
utter surprise and absolute innocence.

1193
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,640
Jothi can't become a saint 
because you are her daughter!

1194
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:06,400
It is true Jothi killed 
innocent children brutally.'

1195
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:10,800
Police unearthed the bodies of 
the deceased in your backyard is also true!'

1196
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,760
And it is true the two youngsters 
who intervened were killed.'

1197
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:17,480
In fact, I have to list out all these facts 
as truth to convert your lies into truth.

1198
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:19,000
That is nothing 
but the whole truth!

1199
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:29,400
What's up 'nanba'?

1200
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,000
Sorry Venba!

1201
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,440
Venba Pethuraj.

1202
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,000
Venba Sakthijothi!

1203
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:35,880
How do I address you?

1204
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,920
Do you know whom you are 
pitting your wits against?

1205
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,000
Rajarathinam!

1206
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,240
You would have studied law 
just to defend this case.

1207
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,800
But when laws were 
drafted for our nation,

1208
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,440
...my family held these law books 
in their hands with experience.

1209
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:50,000
I have seen many cases like this 
to reach this rung in my ladder of success!

1210
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:53,000
I had a niggling doubt 
something was fishy in this case.

1211
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,400
Every case has a weak point.

1212
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,800
That has made you and me 
reach our present standpoint.

1213
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:00,400
Reaching is not important. 
But the research and final result!

1214
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:07,000
You have lied through your teeth!

1215
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:10,120
Do you know why Varadarajan has 
brought me into this case now?

1216
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:11,440
Because I am the best!

1217
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,680
But there is a beast in me too!

1218
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,320
To pep up the case 
and make it more interesting,

1219
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:19,520
...I'll give the defense attorney 
precious points on a golden platter.

1220
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,360
When I asked you 
about Ramar over the phone,

1221
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,640
...you said you created the character 
to strengthen your case.

1222
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:27,400
I believed you 
for Varadarajan's sake.

1223
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,560
But you still have some facts 
you have forsaken!

1224
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,880
You might as well tell me before Venba 
spills the beans in court tomorrow!

1225
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,800
Will you confess now?

1226
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,280
Or be confined?

1227
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,040
Sir...

1228
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,200
I didn't arrest Jothi!

1229
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:42,320
She surrendered.

1230
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,760
I chose to do this 
with a greed for promotion.

1231
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,560
Jothi surrendered to Suresh.

1232
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,240
I got the truth out 
and told Varadarajan!'

1233
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:56,360
I suggest you discard your coat 
and look for some other job.'

1234
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,160
If you don't get any job 
join as my junior.'

1235
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,600
At least first of every month 
you are assured of a salary!'

1236
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:26,920
Enough my dear!

1237
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:30,240
I can't bear to see you like this.

1238
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,520
Wrap up everything!

1239
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:36,320
We have nothing left to fight.

1240
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,720
We have lost dear.

1241
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,440
I am so...

1242
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,960
I am so scared I may lose you!

1243
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:55,040
You should not be scared 
of anything other than truth.

1244
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,720
We will be harassed even more.

1245
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:01,120
You taught me not to take two steps back 
when they hassle or humiliate you.

1246
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,080
Am I hearing this from you?

1247
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:08,880
Laws and court are designed to suit 
the needs of those with money and might.

1248
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,320
Not for us, the common people!

1249
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:15,480
No pa!

1250
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,960
I have faith in our system.

1251
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:19,880
Only liars will prosper!'

1252
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:24,120
If that is so and only bad people can win, 
this world would've been destroyed long ago.

1253
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,360
Just because of this hardship,

1254
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,520
...how can I let go of this case 
half way through?

1255
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,440
Truth should triumph pa!

1256
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:35,680
I don't agree with you.

1257
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:38,680
Whatever you may say 
my mind can't be consoled.

1258
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,920
Listen to your father. 
Best solution is to let go!

1259
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:46,760
Dreams diffuse into oblivion. 
Won't night dawn in my horizon?

1260
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:53,200
Won't life take a new turn from now on?

1261
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:56,160
Venba don't be worried okay?

1262
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:57,840
Go, sleep. 
Goodnight!

1263
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:05,120
Won't truth one day be out in the open?

1264
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,520
Motivating me is your role. 
Your words hurt, heart and soul!

1265
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,360
What will I do with my unfulfilled goal?

1266
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:17,080
Hands that helped me to safety, 
how will I sleep without any anxiety?

1267
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,880
Will I find my way, I wonder, 
to touch the sky in all its splendor?

1268
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,880
How can loss of one witness 
make us lose this case?

1269
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:25,360
If SI Suresh Pandian is not alive, 
this case is as good as buried!

1270
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:26,840
It is all dead and gone!

1271
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,760
Don't say it like a broken record.

1272
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,600
There must be a way. 
I have full faith!

1273
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,360
I am telling you, 
we have lost!

1274
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:35,080
[clap of thunder]

1275
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,320
Please understand. Without him 
we have nothing to go by!

1276
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,960
What really happened to Jothi?'

1277
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,960
Why was she arrested and 
killed in a police encounter?'

1278
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:49,200
Our quest for 15 years in finding 
the only man who knew the truth as it is.'

1279
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:53,000
Our first and final witness 
was sub inspector Suresh Pandian!'

1280
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,600
Jothi surrendered to me first sir.

1281
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,880
The fact I arrested her 
or the police encounter,

1282
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:00,840
...both are lies!

1283
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,040
To prevent her from exposing 
the truth to the world,

1284
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,760
...she was murdered.

1285
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:08,920
Sir at least after all these years,

1286
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,320
...the world should know 
Jothi was innocent and a victim.

1287
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,840
Please come and narrate this 
verbatim in court sir!

1288
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,080
Definitely!

1289
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,000
I am most willing to 
tell the whole truth in court sir.

1290
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:24,600
No one can file a case against 
a big shot like Varadarajan.

1291
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,800
I made people believe I was filing 
a case for mere publicity.

1292
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,560
Through Suresh Pandian 
somehow we thought...

1293
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,840
...we can reveal the truth 
behind this tragedy to the whole world!

1294
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:39,560
Varadarajan was cunning enough to replace 
the public prosecutor with Rajarathinam.

1295
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:44,320
We were convinced we can bring justice 
to Jothi's demise and clear her image.

1296
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,320
That's why we bore the brunt of 
all the hassles and humiliation silently.

1297
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,600
But what is the use?

1298
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:52,160
Suresh was the pulse for this case!

1299
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,120
His pulse is ruptured now.'

1300
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:00,800
Even if the leaves fall in fall 
this tree will stand firm and tall!

1301
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:06,520
You are eternal spring after all!

1302
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:12,480
Even if darkness drowns you in gloom 
don't give in to despair and doom!

1303
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:17,960
O' dawn's rays; glow and bloom!

1304
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,360
Seasons favor you readily 
Scars gone with the wind verily.

1305
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:24,320
Let us live life to the fullest daily!

1306
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:27,360
Unexplored depths to unravel 
Extent of the sky to travel!

1307
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:30,280
Let us climb the skies of success as well!

1308
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:33,240
Even if severed by a sword's blow, 
Be a root that struggles to grow.

1309
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:36,160
Stand firm to face the morrow!

1310
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:39,120
Like petals don't wither and fall 
Be the root to prop up tall!

1311
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:42,920
Wear the garland of victory; don't stall!

1312
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:59,440
You should never be scared 
of anyone or anything in life.'

1313
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,400
Stand bold brave and tall!'

1314
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:03,440
Fight with full faith in your belief.'

1315
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:07,200
Amma will always be with you!'

1316
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:26,000
No daughter will call a kidnapper 
as her mother with this conviction.

1317
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:27,720
That is proof enough.

1318
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:31,600
Some kind of strange truth 
lies behind every word you utter!

1319
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:36,200
If it is true listening to your conscience 
you are fighting for truth,

1320
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:41,800
...the God you believe in and the prayers 
of mothers who lost their children like me,

1321
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,400
...will support you in solidarity.

1322
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:47,120
Fight till the very end till everyone 
is aware of the real truth. Go!

1323
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,680
-Give me the phone. 
-I won't! Get lost!'

1324
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,160
-Welcome. 
-Vanakkam madam.

1325
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,240
Please sit down.

1326
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:07,480
May I know who you are?

1327
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,040
-Please sit. 
-She is Venba!

1328
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:10,600
Mr Pethuraj's daughter!

1329
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,400
He used to keep talking about you.

1330
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,480
-Hi. 
-Hi!

1331
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,760
Fine, don't give. 
I'll take appa's phone.

1332
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,680
Vanakkam!

1333
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:34,640
I am Varadarajan.

1334
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,960
Vanakkam!

1335
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,640
I have heard about you sir.

1336
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,000
She is Venba. 
Known to my husband.

1337
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,520
She has come from Ooty.

1338
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:47,080
I'll get coffee for you sir!.

1339
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:49,560
Venba...

1340
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,920
I am quite surprised 
to see you here.

1341
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,160
Did you send off Suresh 
to rest in peace?

1342
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:59,840
I don't know how many will follow suit 
before this case is wrapped up?

1343
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,760
Sir don't let your tongue run!

1344
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,200
Hey! Don't interrupt me 
when I'm talking.

1345
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:05,360
Just shut up.

1346
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:08,760
What will you achieve 
by reopening this case?

1347
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,440
Just let go of everything.

1348
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,200
You can't resolve anything.

1349
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:13,560
That's how it will seem now.

1350
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,080
We can tackle it. 
You can leave.

1351
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,920
Didn't I tell you to shut up?

1352
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,120
How dare you threaten us! 
What atrocities you...

1353
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:20,240
Damn you!

1354
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:29,880
Respect!

1355
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:33,800
When I talk only my voice should be heard.

1356
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:39,800
There are hordes of people waiting to fall 
at my feet if I step out of this house.

1357
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:45,440
I need to be respected 
until my dying day!

1358
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,160
I will caution you 
only once patiently.

1359
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:50,840
Not every single time.

1360
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:54,080
Abandon everything and go. 
Do you get what I said?

1361
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,200
Don't get perturbed!

1362
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:59,880
It was an accident 
when I got up the glass broke.

1363
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,760
I'll take leave now, 
I have work to attend to!

1364
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:07,600
I wanted to inform you I would like 
to take care of your children's education.

1365
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,400
Please don't hesitate to ask me 
if you need help of any sort.

1366
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:11,880
I don't want to trouble you sir.

1367
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:14,560
I'm so glad you found time 
to come all the way to visit me.

1368
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,440
Venba I'm leaving!

1369
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:18,800
Careful!

1370
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:24,200
We'll also take leave madam.

1371
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:25,880
Call us if you need any help.

1372
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,480
-We are there for you. 
-Okay!

1373
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:29,840
I'm really sorry for your loss.

1374
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:35,880
Venba are you producing any evidence?

1375
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:39,240
Listen I'm asking you.

1376
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,320
Your Honour, not the usual grace time!

1377
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,920
Even if you give two years, 
this case won't have evidence.

1378
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,880
She won't even have 'Evi' in evidence 
let alone the full eight letter word!

1379
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,840
For the simple reason 
such an evidence doesn't exist.

1380
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,480
This may be her only case!

1381
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:53,280
I have a huge backlog 
of pending cases to attend to.

1382
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:57,280
No daughter can bear to have 
even a villainous mother vilified.

1383
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:59,120
She will fly into a rage for sure.

1384
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,000
She isn't in a mental state 
to understand Jothi's crime.

1385
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:07,160
I ask this court in all humility to arrange 
a professional psychiatrist to treat her...

1386
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:08,880
Why beat around the bush?

1387
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:10,640
Be direct!

1388
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:12,480
Call me a lunatic.

1389
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:15,480
For 15 long years,

1390
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:19,800
...convinced I could bring to light 
the facts concealed in this case,

1391
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:21,880
...I put up with all the humiliation.

1392
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:23,760
I must be mad!

1393
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:26,000
Justice will triumph!

1394
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:29,400
This court always strives to be 
impartial in its verdict to people.

1395
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,800
I believe that even now 
in utter foolishness.

1396
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:33,920
You bet I am mad!

1397
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:37,920
Knowing the voice box of victims 
is being silenced.

1398
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:41,160
I am standing before you, 
my hands tied alone and helpless!

1399
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,480
I am definitely a lunatic.

1400
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
How is it sir?

1401
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:53,240
If girls fight for justice with courage 
and conviction, you label it as madness?

1402
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:56,840
If we elaborate our problems aloud 
to society it is termed 'drama'!

1403
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:59,520
If we share our tears, 
we are drama queens!

1404
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:03,880
Why is the pain behind our truths 
always fake and false to you sir?

1405
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,400
Rajarathinam sir!

1406
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,760
Have you ever got up 
in cold sweat from a nightmare,

1407
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:13,280
...dreaming a hundred people are 
strangling you at the same time?

1408
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:14,360
What?

1409
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:16,920
Never, I'm sure!

1410
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,560
Renowned advocate family right?

1411
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:21,600
What is pain?

1412
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,960
For that matter 
what is loss or scars?

1413
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,000
Absolutely clueless!

1414
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,880
But I wasn't that lucky.

1415
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:32,560
It has been years since I slept 
peacefully for a whole night.

1416
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:36,080
Behind the flash of my smile 
are unshed tears.

1417
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,640
Unleashed rage within me, 
I'm unable to put my past behind me.

1418
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:41,880
Every single night,

1419
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:48,120
...I die a thousand deaths hounded by hands 
belonging to unknown faces chasing me.

1420
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:50,840
Pain!

1421
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:52,160
Loss!

1422
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,440
Bruises!

1423
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:56,480
They are indelible scars all over my body!

1424
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:04,240
Your Honour do you remember Aasifa?

1425
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,520
I am sure you do.

1426
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,560
Because there's a child 
in your house and mine,

1427
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:12,800
...who has to grow up 
crossing Aasifa's age.

1428
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:15,320
Aasifa!

1429
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,560
Hasini!

1430
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:17,600
Nandhini!

1431
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:19,320
Names we come across daily.

1432
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:21,760
Just News to us.

1433
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:28,880
Have you ever thought of your child 
in those children's shoes even once?

1434
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,560
Only then you will know the raw pain 
of what was just News to you.

1435
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:36,920
As far as we are concerned,

1436
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,080
...we assume our children are 
growing up in a protected environment!

1437
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:43,800
But that isn't true.

1438
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:49,440
In one of those affectionate moments spent 
with your children ask them with concern.

1439
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:55,040
Someone you know at some point in time 
would have sexually abused that child.

1440
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:58,480
In all the streets in our country,

1441
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:01,640
...there are many Aasifas and Hasinis.

1442
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:06,640
But they lack the guts to express 
the atrocities forced on them.

1443
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:12,480
Some don't even know how to disclose 
the abuse they are suffering under duress.

1444
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:17,640
Before knowing the joys 
and sorrows life metes out!

1445
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:20,840
Disregarding the fact she is a child 
to take advantage of her body,

1446
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,800
...is the most barbaric violence.

1447
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:28,360
If every sexually abused child 
starts talking point-blank and publicly,

1448
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,840
...the pristine images of so many 
so called noble souls...

1449
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:34,040
...will splinter into a million shards!

1450
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,680
Why are you talking in verses 
true to your name 'Venba'?

1451
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:37,880
Speak up like a lawyer!

1452
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:40,040
Is there any connection between 
your sermon and this case?

1453
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,160
Of course, Mr. Rajarathinam!

1454
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:45,240
That is the reason I took up 
this case after all these years!

1455
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:48,480
The same reason my mother 
shot dead those two youngsters.

1456
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:51,760
You keep branding 
all this as innocent right?

1457
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:55,800
Atrocities of those two youngsters 
activated this torturous trauma.

1458
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:59,840
You keep saying Jothi shot 
those innocent lads...

1459
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:01,720
Why did she shoot them?

1460
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:05,120
Tell me if even a single person here 
knows the reason behind that pain?

1461
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:09,200
I know Your Honour!

1462
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:10,320
Venba!

1463
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:12,840
Don't my dear.

1464
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:14,000
Sorry pa.

1465
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:16,840
Some truths need to be exposed.

1466
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:20,960
Even in the smallest grain of truth 
we conceal under the guise of disgrace,

1467
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,440
...so many monstrous villains 
become glorified heroes!

1468
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:32,680
My mother hated seeing me shed tears 
even if dust fell into my eyes.

1469
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:36,280
But they kidnapped me 
in front of her protective eyes!

1470
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:44,400
Those two youngsters raped many girl children.

1471
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,280
I am also one of them!

1472
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,480
Whenever I am alone,

1473
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:57,240
...replaying the mental image of 
their hands abusing my body...

1474
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:59,560
...I have screamed in terror 
so many days and nights.

1475
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:02,960
That surge of panic!

1476
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:04,880
Alarm!

1477
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:06,880
Pain!

1478
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:09,640
Just one drop of tear 
for all my trauma.

1479
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,920
I am fighting for some sort of justice!

1480
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:19,480
For all those wide-eyed innocent children 
who got raped just like me.

1481
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:39,120
Bodies of the four children unearthed in 
my backyard allegedly killed by Jothi,

1482
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:41,960
...were raped and killed 
by those two vile youngsters!

1483
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:45,640
The police fabricated all this and 
filed their First Information Report!

1484
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:49,440
Doctors who conducted the post mortem and 
the police officers who handled this case...

1485
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:51,360
...are partners in this crime!

1486
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:55,360
All this was Varadarajan's conspiracy 
to save his son Rohith and his friend.

1487
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:59,200
To show the miscreants in good light,

1488
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:02,560
...he blackened my innocent mother 
as a psycho killer!

1489
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:07,720
Sub inspector Suresh had a change of heart 
and was willing to confess everything.

1490
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:11,040
Getting wind of his intentions 
they threatened him.

1491
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,760
They forced him to commit suicide!

1492
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,680
And blamed it on pressure of work.

1493
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:19,080
She is rambling unnecessarily 
and misleading this case.

1494
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:21,960
Sir sit down. 
Allow her to talk!'

1495
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,320
To prove any of that.

1496
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
I have nothing to submit as evidence 
except truth and tears, Your Honour.

1497
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,760
To claim I struggled and lost,

1498
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,160
...this isn't a game!

1499
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:39,040
Justice!

1500
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:42,400
I'm not standing here 
as an advocate today,

1501
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:44,800
...but a girl victimized.

1502
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,280
I am speaking with the firm faith 
only truth will triumph.

1503
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:52,200
Because throughout this world,

1504
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:55,400
...many who have been traumatized 
through physical abuse and violence

1505
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,880
...won't have any other evidence 
other than truth, Your Honour.

1506
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:04,280
Listen Venba, my solace is ever present 
for those who were affected by this trauma.

1507
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:13,760
But for a judge,

1508
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,760
...evidence presented 
in front of his eyes...

1509
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:18,320
...will determine 
the nature of his verdict.'

1510
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:20,480
Your mother Jothi killed those four children

1511
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:24,600
...is confirmed by the post mortem 
and forensic reports.

1512
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:31,000
There is no evidence in any report to aid 
your theory those children were raped.

1513
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,560
When no blame can be 
pinned on those two youngsters,

1514
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:36,680
...how can you accuse Varadarajan 
of being a criminal?

1515
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:47,800
Judgment is tomorrow. 
Court is adjourned!

1516
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:50,040
How many more women? 
How many more children?'

1517
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:53,040
How long will this continue 
to each and every one of us too?'

1518
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:55,360
How can evidence be provided 
for such cases sir?'

1519
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:57,360
I consider myself as that girl's father.'

1520
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:59,240
She is striving so hard for justice!'

1521
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:01,880
But what is the use? 
Our law leans towards the rich not poor.'

1522
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:05,720
Sir, court needs evidence! 
Tears won't win cases.'

1523
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,160
Child rape is the worst crime!'

1524
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:11,040
If this happened to my child 
I swear I won't spare that blackguard.'

1525
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:13,280
What to do? 
Our laws are flawed!'

1526
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:14,640
This is our Law!'

1527
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:18,680
According to our Court of Law 
when a girl files a case of rape,'

1528
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:21,680
...court doesn't require the truth. 
Verdict hinges on evidence only!'

1529
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,520
Where is your advocate?

1530
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:48,080
No sir er... due to personal reasons 
she was unable to attend court today!

1531
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,040
I've lost amma.

1532
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,240
I couldn't defend you.

1533
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:12,040
Everything has slipped out of our hands.

1534
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:14,640
Forgive me ma.

1535
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:19,480
Forgive me.

1536
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:25,200
I have failed you ma.

1537
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:29,520
I LOST MA!

1538
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:40,760
VENBA!

1539
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:44,640
Venba...

1540
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:51,720
Venba you haven't lost!

1541
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,880
The case hasn't slipped out of your hands.

1542
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,800
In this case, I had specified 
judgment will be passed today.

1543
01:32:58,040 --> 01:33:00,120
But regarding this case,

1544
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:03,720
...scrutinizing the case history 
more than just once...

1545
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:08,200
...I think it will augur well 
to interrogate Mr. Varadarajan!

1546
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:11,960
Your Honour, I think this is 
an unrequired confusion.

1547
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,560
It is crystal clear Mr. Varadarajan is 
in no way connected to this case.

1548
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:16,880
Why drag him into this sir?

1549
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:21,920
Rajarathinam sir in some twisted logic 
his name has been pulled into this case.

1550
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,480
What is your problem sir 
in Varadarajan being summoned?

1551
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:26,840
We can close this case and 
all of us can move on right?

1552
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:29,760
That is exactly my thought too. 
Close the case and move on.

1553
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:33,600
There's no reason in changing your mind 
after intending to pronounce judgment!

1554
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:35,200
Why this unnecessary tension?

1555
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:37,600
This court's main purpose 
is to sift and sieve the truth.

1556
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:40,000
How can I pass judgment 
before exploring all avenues?

1557
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:41,640
Your Honour, this is unfair.

1558
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:44,680
I somehow feel you are 
showing favoritism.

1559
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,800
Rajarathinam sir, mind your words.

1560
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:49,440
No I won't allow him to 
be summoned here for sure!

1561
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:50,640
STOP IT!

1562
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:55,040
Varadarajan has to be here 
for the next hearing.

1563
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:58,160
I will close this case 
only after he is interrogated!

1564
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:03,840
This case can't be wrapped up 
according to your whims and fancies.

1565
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:06,880
The next hearing is day after tomorrow!

1566
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:08,200
The court is adjourned!

1567
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,640
Venba you haven't lost my dear.

1568
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,640
[mobile ringing]

1569
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:44,640
-Hello? 
-'Member of Parliament Anand Kumar here.'

1570
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:46,960
I heard you have summoned 
Mr. Varadarajan to court.'

1571
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,520
Are you in your right senses?'

1572
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,640
As if I will decide off the cuff sir?

1573
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:53,720
I know Mr. Varadarajan inside out.

1574
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:57,720
But ever since that girl posted 
the case in High court for retrial,

1575
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:00,440
...she has mentioned his name quite often.

1576
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:01,680
So what man?'

1577
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:05,560
Tomorrow I should not be blamed 
for inadequate interrogation.

1578
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:10,960
Just as a formality, ask him 
to attend the proceedings sir.

1579
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,520
I can wrap up the case!

1580
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:13,800
Is that so?'

1581
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:15,280
And then sir...

1582
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:17,600
What are you pitching for? 
Out with it!

1583
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:20,800
I've fixed my daughter's wedding date.

1584
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:22,000
Congratulations!

1585
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:24,800
You must put in a word 
to Mr. Varadarajan.

1586
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:27,880
You could have told me your position 
right in the beginning of our chat.

1587
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:29,680
He has deep pockets 
and a generous heart.

1588
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:32,000
-'I will ask him to attend the wedding.' 
-Thank you sir!

1589
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,960
-Here sir. 
-All yours sir!

1590
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,480
Hey! What have you done?

1591
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:51,800
You were the epitome of righteousness.

1592
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:55,200
You sold your soul stooping so low 
because you had a financial crunch!

1593
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:57,080
If your family has to 
hold you in high regard,

1594
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:59,640
...you were the one who told me 
money is an evil necessity.

1595
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:01,400
Now you are acting 
so prim and proper.

1596
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:02,960
Why target this case?

1597
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:08,200
How did you have the heart to do this?

1598
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:11,680
I consider it a sin to have 
anything to do with you.

1599
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:37,600
Sir please don't...

1600
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:39,920
Are you reassuring me 
not to be scared Rathinam?

1601
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:46,400
15 years ago I took all efforts to 
diligently close this case with a big lid!

1602
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:49,760
What is it she can ask me?

1603
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:00,360
Is Jothi's case Mr. Varadarajan here?

1604
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:01,640
Yes sir!

1605
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:03,280
Varadarajan.

1606
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:04,440
Sir...

1607
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,440
Venba you can proceed!

1608
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,120
Your name?

1609
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:30,400
Varadarajan!

1610
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:31,760
Tell me about yourself.

1611
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,440
I'm an ordinary man.

1612
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:35,560
Through Rohith Trust and companies,

1613
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:38,880
...I give financial aid to about 
20,000 poor families in Tamil Nadu,

1614
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:41,160
...and educational expenses 
of their children.

1615
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:44,040
I do what I can to help 
the people below poverty line.

1616
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:45,920
A company you own in Tiruppur,

1617
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:49,640
...it has been indicted for 
encroachment on agricultural lands!

1618
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,360
Not just an accusation my dear.

1619
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:54,040
A case was filed.

1620
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:59,400
Court felt those cases were mere 
publicity stunts and dismissed them.

1621
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,120
20 years ago,

1622
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:03,760
...your garment business incurred losses.

1623
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:06,520
In order to claim insurance money, 
you cleared the entire stock...

1624
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:08,200
...and set the factory on fire deliberate...

1625
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:09,320
Objection, Your Honour!

1626
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:10,600
Rajarathinam sir.'

1627
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,800
It's true my factory was burnt down.

1628
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:19,760
Insurance company enquired 
about the accident thoroughly.

1629
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,480
Only then handed over 
the claim amount to me.

1630
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:24,920
So many such similar complaints 
are piled against you.

1631
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:27,320
But none of them get filed as cases!

1632
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:29,200
How is that sir?

1633
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:32,160
If cases are filed based on rumors...

1634
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:34,960
...1000 cases or more will have to be 
filed against every individual dear!

1635
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,440
There won't be enough courts 
in our country to handle them.

1636
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:41,800
If you want to know about a person 
you must enquire with the people properly.

1637
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,880
No point in just browsing 
through Google to interrogate me.

1638
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:47,760
Venba ask questions 
pertaining to this case alone.

1639
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,920
Sir why are you so silent?

1640
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:51,640
Wait and watch.

1641
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:53,280
I have a bomb just 
for the climax!

1642
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:54,800
That's your trademark!

1643
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:56,840
2004!

1644
01:38:57,440 --> 01:39:00,960
Near Peelamedu signal under the pretext 
of running a public welfare scheme...

1645
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,880
...you assembled a huge crowd.

1646
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:05,280
It created a gridlock for two hours.

1647
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:08,680
A patient in an ambulance got stuck 
in that traffic and even died.

1648
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:13,600
In fact, people say you had deliberately 
planned the traffic jam to kill him!

1649
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:14,920
Do you accept it?

1650
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:19,520
Given a chance will you blame me for 
every single crime in Coimbatore dear?

1651
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:23,320
Even to swat a mosquito 
which sits on me to bite me...

1652
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:26,040
...I think twice before doing so.

1653
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:29,360
Mr. Varadarajan I am an advocate.

1654
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:32,280
Don't address me with 
all these endearing terms.

1655
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,400
Do you understand?

1656
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:38,560
'Amma' is not a demeaning word my dear.

1657
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:44,320
Isn't it our custom in Tamil Nadu 
to address our women as 'amma'?

1658
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:48,600
It is customary to add a suffix 'da' 
to men to denote disrespect too!

1659
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:50,080
Shall I do so?

1660
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:52,480
Hey! How dare you! 
You won't step out alive!

1661
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:53,560
Silence!

1662
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:55,360
Do you think this is court 
or a fish market?

1663
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:56,560
Sit down.'

1664
01:39:57,280 --> 01:40:00,080
I came to this court only because 
I respect our judiciary system.

1665
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:02,840
She doesn't know the meaning 
of the word 'respect'!

1666
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:04,840
Hope you are aware.

1667
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:07,720
I shall take leave!

1668
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:15,480
Respect!

1669
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:17,320
'Damn you!'

1670
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:22,200
I need to be respected 
until my dying day.'

1671
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:23,720
Varadarajan.

1672
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:33,920
Did I ask you to leave?

1673
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:36,240
Mr. Varadarajan...

1674
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:38,160
Till she completes her interrogation...

1675
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:39,880
...kindly cooperate.

1676
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:42,560
Can't bribe everyone 
and buy their silence.

1677
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,280
How do I come across to you?

1678
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,360
If I come for a hearing will you treat me 
with total lack of respect like this, huh?

1679
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,200
Standing here in the witness box,

1680
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:02,400
...to a criminal even an interrogation 
will seem like humiliation, Varadarajan!

1681
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:05,320
Just answer my questions.

1682
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:08,480
Aren't you one among the few 
using licensed pistols in Coimbatore?

1683
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:09,520
Yes!

1684
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:10,560
So what now?

1685
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:12,520
Has your son used your pistol?

1686
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,480
He was very young.

1687
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:18,000
He had no idea where my pistol was.

1688
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:21,560
Please come.

1689
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:32,400
Varadarajan.

1690
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:34,080
Look at me!

1691
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:36,480
-When your son died... 
-No...!

1692
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:38,840
My son didn't die 
of natural causes.

1693
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:41,080
He was mur... murdered!

1694
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:42,520
Okay fine!

1695
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,640
Few days after his death,

1696
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:46,280
...did you visit Ooty?

1697
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:49,280
Yes!

1698
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:52,680
At that time do you remember 
visiting any other place in Ooty?

1699
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:53,760
No!

1700
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:57,320
-I didn't visit any other place. 
-So you claim.

1701
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:59,560
But I have a witness here 
who contradicts you.

1702
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:02,880
Do you recognize him?

1703
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:13,720
He is the only witness who saw Alexander 
handing over Jothi to you.

1704
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:20,360
He opened the gates of 
your tea factory for you on that day!

1705
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:28,760
Why are you sweating sir 
even in this cold Ooty weather?

1706
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,280
Is it out of fear?

1707
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:34,480
Fear?

1708
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:39,080
There is no need for me to be 
afraid of anyone or anything.

1709
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:40,720
Then tell the truth da!

1710
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:43,160
How dare you address me 
with disrespect 'di'?

1711
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,640
Yes da!

1712
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:47,720
Anyhow, even if you don't blurt out 
the truth he will do the needful.

1713
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:50,720
Who the hell is he to tell di?

1714
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:53,920
I will tell you myself.

1715
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:56,640
Yes!

1716
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:58,080
I went there.

1717
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:06,480
This court or law 
can't hurt or harm me.

1718
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:10,800
Varadarajan do you realize what 
you are saying or where you are standing?'

1719
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:13,160
Why did you go there? 
Answer her question!

1720
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:14,920
How can he answer that Your Honour?

1721
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,200
I will tell you...

1722
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:18,800
...what might have transpired.

1723
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:24,880
This kind of pain a parent of 
a girl child should never experience.'

1724
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:28,240
In front of her parents 
if a girl child is kidnapped...'

1725
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,600
When my mother was right there,'

1726
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:35,520
...because of those boys,'

1727
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:37,840
...I was traumatized!'

1728
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:42,840
More than the pain 
when those boys kidnapped me,'

1729
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:45,360
...it was my mother's anguished scream.'

1730
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:46,480
Pappu...!

1731
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:48,280
It echoed in my ears!'

1732
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,400
What happened?

1733
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:54,000
Pappu...!

1734
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:55,200
Hey!

1735
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:56,760
Amma...!

1736
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:58,800
Someone... help!

1737
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:00,080
Save my daughter!

1738
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:01,360
Hey...!

1739
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:02,880
Amma...!

1740
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,520
Help... help me!

1741
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,120
Amma...!'

1742
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:18,280
Pappu...!'

1743
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,600
Pappu...

1744
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:35,640
Pappu!

1745
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:55,400
Pappu.'

1746
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:00,120
Where are you my dear?

1747
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:04,480
Hidden somewhere 
with hands tied,'

1748
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,440
...not knowing what he was doing to me.'

1749
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:09,600
Numb! Not able to react.'

1750
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:12,320
I was shattered.'

1751
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:14,640
The pain that seared through me,'

1752
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,200
...can't be described.'

1753
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:28,600
Pappu...?

1754
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:44,320
I will be your sky with sunshine bright.

1755
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:53,400
Protect you from pain however slight!

1756
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:55,160
Wake up dear!

1757
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:59,480
I will gladly be your best friend.

1758
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:02,520
Don't you always say 
you don't like your amma crying?

1759
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:05,880
Tick your wish-list.

1760
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:07,680
I am crying now no?

1761
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:11,640
Till the very end!

1762
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:14,320
Open your eyes. 
Tell me not to cry.

1763
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:30,280
A chariot without my idol am I.

1764
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:35,280
Parched land, desolate and dry!

1765
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:37,040
Don't hurt me!'

1766
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:41,000
Is my language fluent or do I falter?

1767
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:43,400
Who am I here, my dear daughter?

1768
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:45,480
How can this happen to you?'

1769
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:49,520
Trees flower; springtime beauty.

1770
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:51,840
God! Wish it was me instead!'

1771
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:55,960
Colors add to nature's bounty.

1772
01:47:56,040 --> 01:48:03,960
My boon, blessing, felicity. 
You mean the world to me!

1773
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:10,240
My precious princess heavenly.

1774
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:12,560
Get up Pappu!

1775
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:21,720
Won't someone in this world 
take me away from all this?'

1776
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:23,400
Praying desperately!'

1777
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:27,600
That was when I heard my mother 
sob 'Pappu' with such anguish.'

1778
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:32,600
Amma is here.

1779
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:33,920
I won't die ma.'

1780
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:37,680
I felt like telling her 
I won't leave you so soon.'

1781
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:41,120
You will be fine my dear.

1782
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:45,200
There was just like me 
equally devastated,'

1783
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:46,960
...another girl!'

1784
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:49,960
Angel.'

1785
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,320
When I told my mother,'

1786
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:55,840
...she ran to save her 
panic stricken... agitated.'

1787
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:03,320
Poor girl was already dead.'

1788
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:06,160
How much pain 
she must have endured!'

1789
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:32,800
[dog barking]

1790
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:01,960
Hey, catch her!

1791
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:03,600
Don't...

1792
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:05,800
Don't touch her!

1793
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:12,480
Get her!

1794
01:50:13,160 --> 01:50:14,680
Come and help me.

1795
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:16,040
Let go...!

1796
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:23,560
Get hold of her.

1797
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:27,800
To make the criminal 
an innocent victim...'

1798
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:30,320
Machaan!'

1799
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:34,400
...my mother shot them with 
a country gun the police claime!d'

1800
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:37,240
That gun...'

1801
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:40,200
...was in the possession 
of Varadarajan's son.'

1802
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:43,920
Hey! Don't.

1803
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:47,440
Listen to me.

1804
01:50:47,480 --> 01:50:48,840
Hand over the gun.

1805
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:51,760
Don't shoot.

1806
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:54,920
Give it.'

1807
01:50:57,960 --> 01:50:59,400
Run... run!

1808
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:08,200
Come on!

1809
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:14,240
Machaan... dude?'

1810
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:17,760
Don't... don't shoot!

1811
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:33,920
[banging on door]

1812
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:44,840
Jothi, I was looking for you 
all over the place.

1813
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:46,480
What happened to Pappu?

1814
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:48,840
Let me carry her.

1815
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:51,200
Oh God!

1816
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:52,920
What is this blood stain?

1817
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:55,600
Oh God! What is this?

1818
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:57,120
She is also bleeding.

1819
01:51:57,160 --> 01:51:58,280
What happened dear?

1820
01:51:58,320 --> 01:51:59,760
Jo... Jothi...!

1821
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:00,840
Jothi!

1822
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:01,920
Philomina...?

1823
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:03,560
Oh God!

1824
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:06,920
A new twist in the case of 
children missing for the past few weeks.'

1825
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:09,520
...police suspect the psycho killer 
seen in the video...'

1826
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:14,120
...may be responsible for the series 
of child-kidnappings in Ooty.'

1827
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:16,600
Amma...!

1828
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:18,920
Pappu don't worry. 
I'm right next to you.

1829
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:28,440
Police inspector Alexander's team in Ooty...'

1830
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:30,760
...has been hunting high and low 
for the psycho killer.'

1831
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:34,160
In addition, shoot at sight 
orders have been issued.'

1832
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:38,960
Jothi...?

1833
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:40,600
-Where is Jothi? 
-She is inside.

1834
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:42,560
-Why are you so flustered? 
-I'll tell you!

1835
01:52:42,600 --> 01:52:43,600
Jothi!

1836
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:47,560
Jothi, the police have found out 
our house is in this area.

1837
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:49,520
They might be here any minute.

1838
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:51,400
Escape with the child 
through the back door!

1839
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:53,440
Sir the police will find me anyway.

1840
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:56,920
You have helped me so much.

1841
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:00,320
My child... please!

1842
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:02,280
Take her somewhere safe.

1843
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:03,480
What are you saying?

1844
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:05,280
How can we leave you 
like this and go?

1845
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:06,560
Your life will be wasted.

1846
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:08,040
We can all leave together.

1847
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:09,760
I'll get you both to a safe plac...

1848
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:11,320
This child's life is more important!

1849
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:12,440
Listen to her please.'

1850
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:14,800
Let us take the child away 
before the police find us.'

1851
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:19,880
In life you should never be scared 
of anyone or anything in life.'

1852
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:22,560
Stand bold, brave and tall!'

1853
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:24,720
Fight with full faith in your belief.'

1854
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:28,760
Amma will always be with you.'

1855
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:30,520
Right here!

1856
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:34,640
You are my lioness right?

1857
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:53,720
Amma will be with us soon.

1858
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:14,080
My mother surrendered voluntarily 
to the police just to save me.'

1859
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:17,680
She surrendered to 
sub inspector Suresh Pandian.'

1860
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:20,760
When he took my mother 
to present her in court...'

1861
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:24,800
...half way through he was asked to 
bring my mother to Mr. Varadarajan.'

1862
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:26,760
Ordered by inspector Alexander!'

1863
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:03,200
All these years...

1864
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:06,720
...I have been fighting 
for only this one minute!

1865
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:10,720
Shattering someone's identity...

1866
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:13,400
...is the biggest violence!

1867
01:55:15,480 --> 01:55:18,000
The world should have 
revered Jothi as a Goddess.

1868
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:21,560
Instead she was defamed as a demon 
and you were made to believe so!

1869
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:27,080
In this land where a hungry man was beaten 
to death for stealing a handful of rice...

1870
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:31,320
...sex perverts who raped 
hundreds of women and recorded it...

1871
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:33,680
...are roaming the roads scot-free!

1872
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:39,640
Even if a person is beaten to death...

1873
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:42,680
...he will breathe his last in one day.

1874
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:46,520
But rape!

1875
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:50,400
That pain!

1876
01:55:52,360 --> 01:55:53,400
Suffering!

1877
01:55:58,400 --> 01:56:00,320
That too at such a tender age.

1878
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:04,040
No one should go through it, Your Honour.

1879
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:17,120
Girls who have been 
victimized like me...

1880
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:20,520
...I am not sure how many more Venbas 
will come out in the open and speak up!

1881
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,200
But speak hereafter with courage 
without any inhibitions.

1882
01:56:24,240 --> 01:56:28,360
People should believe criminals cannot 
bribe and buy justice, Your Honour!

1883
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:31,280
Because to say 
we women have lost...

1884
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:33,520
...this is not a game Your Honour.

1885
01:56:33,680 --> 01:56:34,920
Justice!

1886
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:49,560
Rajarathinam sir, 
do you have any questions?

1887
01:56:52,160 --> 01:56:53,440
I have nothing to ask.

1888
01:56:53,480 --> 01:56:55,480
But I have only one statement to make.

1889
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:56,760
Venba...

1890
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:58,600
...is not Jothi's daughter at all.

1891
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:03,280
You are not her daughter.

1892
01:57:03,320 --> 01:57:05,360
I meant you are Jothi's angel!

1893
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:07,280
When we dug in front of the bungalow...'

1894
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:09,600
...we found the body of a girl child.'

1895
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:12,800
Equally devastated. 
Another girl'

1896
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:15,840
That girl child is Angel sir!'

1897
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:24,840
In this case of shooting Jothi...'

1898
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:27,080
...covering up his son's crimes...'

1899
01:57:27,160 --> 01:57:31,200
...all charges against Varadarajan 
have clearly been proved to be true!'

1900
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:32,600
Not only that...'

1901
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:37,160
...Inspector Alexander who was 
an accomplice and his team...'

1902
01:57:37,200 --> 01:57:40,080
...have been aiding and abetting 
Varadarajan in many instances.'

1903
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:43,560
Accused number one, Varadarajan, 
will serve a double life sentence!'

1904
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:46,320
His abettors, Alexander and his team,'

1905
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:50,560
...will serve 10 years in prison 
according to the verdict of this court.'

1906
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:14,040
You are not Jothi's daughter, Venba.

1907
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:15,720
You are her angel!

1908
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:17,520
Others may not be aware...

1909
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:21,440
...but I am unable to fathom this.

1910
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:24,760
What a daughter may not do 
for her own mother,

1911
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:26,920
...you have accomplished for Jothi.

1912
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:28,840
Without any blood ties that bind,

1913
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:30,360
...for a random stranger,

1914
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:32,040
...why did you go this far?

1915
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:33,600
Is this love...?

1916
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:35,480
Or debt of gratitude?

1917
01:58:39,680 --> 01:58:40,880
Pain sir!'

1918
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:44,320
To feel someone's pain...'

1919
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:47,200
...we don't need to be blood related sir.'

1920
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:53,040
True, I am not Venba.'

1921
01:58:53,240 --> 01:58:54,360
I am Angel...!'

1922
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:05,320
When I was fervently hoping 
someone will come to save me.'

1923
01:59:06,120 --> 01:59:07,800
Jothi answered my prayers...'

1924
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:14,200
...instead of leaving after seeing 
her Venba lying lifeless.'

1925
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:17,840
I was struggling to breathe 
and she saved me.'

1926
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:19,960
Pappu... Pappu...!

1927
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:22,840
Pappu!

1928
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:31,160
Don't you always say 
you don't like your amma crying?'

1929
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:33,440
Open your eyes. 
Tell me not to cry!'

1930
01:59:34,280 --> 01:59:36,040
Get up Pappu.'

1931
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:37,960
Get up my princess.'

1932
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:40,880
Pappu. please get up and look at me.'

1933
02:00:00,680 --> 02:00:04,880
Only because I understood 
her pain and sacrifice...'

1934
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:07,640
...I am now living as Jothi's Venba.'

1935
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:14,640
I request this to all of you.'

1936
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:17,320
How a girl child should behave...'

1937
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:18,520
Places she can go...'

1938
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:20,080
Her dress code...'

1939
02:00:20,120 --> 02:00:23,680
Parents who teach her 
whom to talk to or befriend...'

1940
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:25,960
...should also teach the boys 
living under the same roof...'

1941
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:30,400
...how to regard respect 
and relate to girls and women.'

1942
02:00:31,040 --> 02:00:32,880
12 year old girl gang raped!'

1943
02:00:32,920 --> 02:00:35,880
India ranks 7th in child sexual abuse.

1944
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:37,800
And Tamil Nadu occupies the third place...

1945
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:40,920
...according to National Crime Records of 2018.

1946
02:00:41,160 --> 02:00:44,280
Under the Child Sexual Abuse Protection Act,

1947
02:00:44,360 --> 02:00:49,280
...there are more than 
1,66000 cases pending in India.

1948
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:51,960
In 94% of these cases,

1949
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:56,640
...perpetuators are mostly close 
or known to the victim.

1950
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:59,920
These inhuman criminals 
should be punished at the earliest.

1951
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:02,240
That should be a lesson to others.

1952
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:05,920
Isn't justice delayed injustice?

1953
02:01:05,960 --> 02:01:10,000
Subtitled by rekhs 
assisted by Harini and Pradeep!

1954
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:12,560
Dreams diffuse into oblivion.

1955
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:15,840
Won't night dawn in my horizon?

1956
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:21,600
Won't life take a new turn from now on?

1957
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:27,520
If a witness is hidden 
will the scene be forgotten?

1958
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:33,800
Won't truth one day be out in the open?

1959
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:37,320
Motivating me is your role. 
Your words hurt, heart and soul.

1960
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:40,120
What will I do with my unfulfilled goal?

1961
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:45,720
Hands that helped me to safety, 
How will I sleep without any anxiety?

1962
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:50,920
In a labyrinth of a forest 
walking in circles am I lost?

1963
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:57,520
Or will I find my way I wonder 
to touch the sky in all its splendor?

1964
02:02:39,120 --> 02:02:44,880
Even if the leaves fall in fall 
this tree will stand firm and tall.

1965
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:51,000
You are eternal spring after all!

1966
02:02:51,040 --> 02:02:56,800
Even if darkness drowns you in gloom, 
don't give in to despair and doom.

1967
02:02:56,840 --> 02:03:00,920
O' dawn's rays; glow and bloom!
