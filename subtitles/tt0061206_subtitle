3
00:00:49,935 --> 00:00:50,935
Come on.

4
00:01:10,853 --> 00:01:14,610
- Rakesh! Where is daddy?
- Daddy?

5
00:01:16,889 --> 00:01:17,889
Come with me.

6
00:01:29,954 --> 00:01:31,256
Daddy!

7
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:33,792
Daughter, why did you come?

8
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:36,995
- Daddy, its 9 o'clock. Come quickly?
- Where?

9
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:41,064
Where? Have you forgotten?
Why didn't you remind him?

10
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:43,974
What is the matter? What
have I forgotten?

11
00:01:44,193 --> 00:01:45,839
Today Mr. Suraj is going to come.

12
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:47,881
And you had promised me that..

13
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:49,548
You would come with
me to the station.

14
00:01:49,887 --> 00:01:51,036
Yes, daughter but..

15
00:01:51,156 --> 00:01:53,420
But it is very important for
me to stay here at this time.

16
00:01:53,444 --> 00:01:55,923
Look, do one thing,
take Rakesh along.

17
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:59,154
There is no need.
I can go alone too.

18
00:02:01,657 --> 00:02:03,534
She has become angry.

19
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:06,923
What can I do Rakesh?
My work is like that.

20
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:12,756
I don't get time to stay and
look after my daughter.

21
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:16,923
But now your problems will get
over, since Mr. Suraj is coming.

22
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:21,881
Yes, once I complete the promise
I made to Suraj's father.

23
00:02:23,114 --> 00:02:26,839
Get them married. After that
I can wash off my hands.

24
00:02:29,601 --> 00:02:32,089
You and Suraj's father
were very good friends.

25
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:36,881
Yes, often people used to think
me to be his younger brother.

26
00:02:38,494 --> 00:02:42,538
Before dying he handed me
over his entire property.

27
00:02:43,982 --> 00:02:45,646
Today when Suraj will come I
will also get unburdened..

28
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,417
Of this heavy load worth millions.

29
00:02:48,138 --> 00:02:49,888
Is wealth a burden, professor?

30
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,339
Yes, Rakesh.

31
00:02:52,308 --> 00:02:56,631
If it belongs to someone else
then it a very huge burden.

32
00:02:57,294 --> 00:02:58,294
Come.

33
00:04:45,247 --> 00:04:48,548
He has come. He has come.
Junior master has come.

34
00:04:48,798 --> 00:04:52,122
First a garland in your neck and
then greetings from Gangaram.

35
00:04:52,162 --> 00:04:53,563
Wow, Gangaram, wow!

36
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,381
The same old Gangaram with
his old talkative ways.

37
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,090
Junior master, I have been talking..

38
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,376
With these walls since
last 10 years.

39
00:05:02,657 --> 00:05:05,038
At least allow me to talk today
to my heart's content.

40
00:05:05,203 --> 00:05:06,939
- You have to talk?
- Yes. - Standing here?

41
00:05:07,304 --> 00:05:09,297
First wear this garland
and come inside.

42
00:05:09,337 --> 00:05:11,839
- Let me get the luggage.
- All right.

43
00:05:29,101 --> 00:05:30,741
Everything is there the
way it was before.

44
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:33,047
I have returned after
so many years..

45
00:05:33,437 --> 00:05:35,256
But it feels I was always here.

46
00:05:36,061 --> 00:05:38,978
I had thought that you must
have forgotten everything.

47
00:05:40,308 --> 00:05:41,308
Rita.

48
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:46,464
There are things which
cannot be forgotten.

49
00:05:53,844 --> 00:05:56,308
Mother used to sit on that
chair and knit sweaters.

50
00:06:05,317 --> 00:06:07,839
Father used to sit there
and read newspapers.

51
00:06:08,686 --> 00:06:12,673
And you used to make this chair
a horse and ride on it.

52
00:06:15,282 --> 00:06:18,214
A small girl used to come
to play with you.

53
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:22,275
And when you used to get
angry and pull her hair..

54
00:06:23,118 --> 00:06:25,839
Then she used to cry.
Do you remember?

55
00:06:27,504 --> 00:06:28,890
Now where is that little girl?

56
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:32,827
Now that girl has grown up.

57
00:06:33,249 --> 00:06:35,172
Does she remember me till now?

58
00:06:38,257 --> 00:06:41,422
There are things which
cannot be forgotten.

59
00:06:58,873 --> 00:06:59,881
A right turn from ahead.

60
00:07:17,448 --> 00:07:19,673
Hey, this mansion is
still standing here.

61
00:07:21,104 --> 00:07:23,506
I don't know, but I was always
interested in this place.

62
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:24,673
Come, let's go inside.

63
00:07:25,037 --> 00:07:27,197
I had written my name in one
of its doors in childhood.

64
00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:29,515
Come, let's go and see, if it
is still there or gone. Come.

65
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:30,715
Come. Come.

66
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,430
Come.

67
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:50,321
Rita! See my name is still here.

68
00:07:52,278 --> 00:07:53,875
There used to be a chain here too.

69
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:55,930
See there.

70
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,363
Strange! These bells still ring.

71
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:17,483
Cone on, let's go now.
We have to go far.

72
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,333
Suraj!

73
00:08:50,231 --> 00:08:51,231
Daddy!

74
00:08:51,841 --> 00:08:53,965
Hey, you have come. Where is Suraj?

75
00:08:54,893 --> 00:08:59,297
Hello, Suraj, my boy.

76
00:08:59,502 --> 00:09:00,506
Professor.

77
00:09:00,994 --> 00:09:03,583
Welcome home. Welcome home.

78
00:09:06,002 --> 00:09:07,548
I have been waiting since long.

79
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:09,991
My eyes had got tormented.
You have grown up.

80
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:11,381
You have changed so much.

81
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:15,256
- Sorry, I couldn't come to the station.
- No problem.

82
00:09:16,203 --> 00:09:18,821
Daddy, I have explained
everything to him..

83
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,214
That nothing is more important
for you than work.

84
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,256
Look, he has not come
home since two days.

85
00:09:24,492 --> 00:09:25,892
Now she has this complaint from me.

86
00:09:26,054 --> 00:09:28,407
And I am also helpless.
Dear, now you make her understand.

87
00:09:28,447 --> 00:09:32,230
For a man like me work is
veneration and devotion.

88
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,136
Professor, even I couldn't
understand this.

89
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:37,567
What is there in excavating
these old ruins?

90
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:38,759
What is the use?

91
00:09:39,423 --> 00:09:40,904
What is the use?

92
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:43,527
Even I cannot say so.

93
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:48,047
But I surely know that
these old ruins..

94
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:52,299
Are the foundation of
the new generation.

95
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:57,589
It's a relation. Culture is a chain.

96
00:09:58,127 --> 00:10:01,031
The entire world is
tied with this chain.

97
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:06,132
The success of man and
of his achievements..

98
00:10:06,891 --> 00:10:11,506
Is because of this very chain.

99
00:10:13,392 --> 00:10:19,607
And it is my duty and life to find
the lost portions of that chain.

100
00:10:19,915 --> 00:10:20,955
Well said, sir. Well said.

101
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,975
And that's why the professor
is regarded..

102
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:24,631
As the biggest archaeologist
in India.

103
00:10:24,803 --> 00:10:26,339
Rakesh, meet Suraj.

104
00:10:26,846 --> 00:10:28,640
Suraj, Rakesh, my assistant.

105
00:10:29,464 --> 00:10:32,474
- Pleased to meet you.
- Thank you. - Professor.

106
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:34,098
Professor.

107
00:10:34,373 --> 00:10:37,439
Master, we have found the
steps to another dungeon.

108
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,602
- Wonderful. Come.
- Excuse me, please.

109
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:01,090
Daddy has found one more part.

110
00:11:02,543 --> 00:11:05,265
- I think, we should return now.
- Come.

111
00:11:10,882 --> 00:11:12,172
- Hey.
- What happened?

112
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:13,777
I forgot to give daddy his medicine.

113
00:11:13,926 --> 00:11:15,902
Wait here, I will just
come in a minute.

114
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:12,932
May I move my neck?

115
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,807
No, just a minute more?

116
00:12:18,027 --> 00:12:21,223
That's it. I am tired.

117
00:12:28,885 --> 00:12:30,807
Hey, you people here?

118
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,348
We should be asking you,
what are you doing here?

119
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,045
We had planned a picnic a week ago..

120
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:37,932
And you had promised to come.

121
00:12:38,223 --> 00:12:43,241
- Actually, he has arrived today.
- He? - Suraj.

122
00:12:49,084 --> 00:12:53,304
Okay so he is the one,
for whom you were waiting.

123
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:55,807
Drat.

124
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:03,557
- Lovely. Beautiful.
- Who the painting or the artist?

125
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:05,625
Yes?

126
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:08,383
Suraj, all these are the members
of our youth club.

127
00:13:08,533 --> 00:13:10,460
- All right, greetings.
- Greetings.

128
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:13,181
Rita, you go to your picnic
with them. I will leave.

129
00:13:13,622 --> 00:13:14,432
Where are you going?

130
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:16,890
- If you are not there, even Rita won't stay with us.
- Why?

131
00:13:17,354 --> 00:13:18,805
Is it something to be questioned?

132
00:13:18,925 --> 00:13:21,431
Come on, Mr. Suraj. You have
to come to the picnic.

133
00:13:21,487 --> 00:13:23,567
What will do by going there?
I don't know anything.

134
00:13:23,687 --> 00:13:25,115
You have snatched our Rita from
us as soon as you have..

135
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,598
Come and you are saying that
you don't know anything.

136
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:29,028
You are so innocent.

137
00:13:29,237 --> 00:13:29,893
Yes?

138
00:13:30,013 --> 00:13:33,502
Is he innocent or a rat?
Ask that of Rita.

139
00:13:36,112 --> 00:13:37,306
Rita I will leave.

140
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:48,994
"To desire something from
you cruel person."

141
00:13:50,187 --> 00:13:57,269
"Maybe the work of other people."

142
00:13:58,158 --> 00:14:05,749
"I just want to see...

143
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:12,515
how cruel you are."

144
00:14:17,238 --> 00:14:19,932
"What is love?"

145
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,198
"I will fall in love and see."

146
00:14:23,382 --> 00:14:26,139
"What is love?"

147
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,277
"I will fall in love and see."

148
00:14:29,377 --> 00:14:31,932
"What is known as punishment?"

149
00:14:32,382 --> 00:14:35,253
"I will go and smitten by someone."

150
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:39,265
"What is love?"

151
00:14:55,349 --> 00:15:01,274
"You have made a beautiful
promise with my heart."

152
00:15:01,422 --> 00:15:07,807
"That I have made my
mind to die for you."

153
00:15:10,522 --> 00:15:16,506
"That I have made my
mind to die for you."

154
00:15:16,746 --> 00:15:19,765
"Where is the noose of love?"

155
00:15:22,848 --> 00:15:25,932
"Where is the noose of love?"

156
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:28,904
"I will go wear this noose too."

157
00:15:29,024 --> 00:15:31,820
"What is known as punishment?"

158
00:15:32,013 --> 00:15:34,914
"I will go and smitten by someone."

159
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,682
"What is love?"

160
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:56,343
"For all my love is
waiting a question."

161
00:15:56,421 --> 00:16:02,741
"See with your intoxicated eyes,
the glass of my heart is empty."

162
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:11,529
"For all my love is
waiting a question."

163
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:17,603
"See with your intoxicated eyes,
the glass of my heart is empty."

164
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:21,159
"How does it get split?"

165
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:26,623
"How does it get split?"

166
00:16:26,775 --> 00:16:29,938
"I will fill the glass and see."

167
00:16:30,058 --> 00:16:32,757
"What is known as punishment?"

168
00:16:33,055 --> 00:16:35,909
"I will go and smitten by someone."

169
00:16:35,974 --> 00:16:39,885
"What is love?"

170
00:16:55,691 --> 00:17:01,746
"How long will you test
me, my darling?"

171
00:17:01,814 --> 00:17:08,250
"Be kind and smile and tell
me what your decision is."

172
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:16,682
"Be kind and smile and tell
me what your decision is."

173
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,139
"On your decision."

174
00:17:23,138 --> 00:17:29,123
"On your decision, I will
die with happiness."

175
00:17:29,188 --> 00:17:31,737
"What is love?"

176
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:35,057
"I will fall in love and see."

177
00:17:35,152 --> 00:17:37,598
"What is known as punishment?"

178
00:17:38,103 --> 00:17:40,961
"I will go and smitten by someone."

179
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:45,393
"What is love?"

180
00:20:36,196 --> 00:20:40,002
A thousand years old painful story..

181
00:20:40,283 --> 00:20:43,187
Was closed in this
room till today.

182
00:21:45,522 --> 00:21:47,410
The dust had got mingled with dust.

183
00:24:44,503 --> 00:24:45,549
Rakesh!

184
00:24:45,813 --> 00:24:49,880
Rakesh! See. See these
bangles match.

185
00:24:51,174 --> 00:24:53,608
From this we can know
that the skeleton..

186
00:24:53,648 --> 00:24:56,492
Was of the same
girl whose this is.

187
00:24:56,762 --> 00:25:03,741
I believe that we have found a lost
chapter in history in these ruins.

188
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:06,315
Photograph this statue
from every angle.

189
00:25:07,143 --> 00:25:09,022
From every angle.

190
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,701
- Why? What had happened?
- I don't know.

191
00:25:51,807 --> 00:25:53,047
I will go and see.

192
00:26:22,742 --> 00:26:23,742
What happened?

193
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,264
Rita, did you hear anyone
laughing just now?

194
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:29,819
No.

195
00:26:31,088 --> 00:26:32,088
Why?

196
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:36,199
Nothing. The car has
heated up. You sit.

197
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:38,096
I will just go and bring water.

198
00:27:36,753 --> 00:27:43,280
"Every part of heart...

199
00:27:44,425 --> 00:27:51,267
prays."

200
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:58,994
"My heart broke, but you didn't...

201
00:27:59,194 --> 00:28:04,885
hear its sound."

202
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,529
"But you didn't hear the sound."

203
00:28:11,905 --> 00:28:19,905
"Every part of heart prays."

204
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:30,380
"My heart broke, but you
didn't hear its sound."

205
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:36,836
"But you didn't hear the sound."

206
00:28:37,491 --> 00:28:43,212
"Every part of heart."

207
00:28:52,686 --> 00:28:57,690
"I am waiting for my goal."

208
00:28:58,007 --> 00:29:02,765
"And my goal is in front of me."

209
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:15,920
"I had to tell him that
destiny is very wicked."

210
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:27,988
"I am waiting for my goal."

211
00:29:28,243 --> 00:29:32,782
"And my goal is in front of me."

212
00:29:33,234 --> 00:29:41,234
"I had to tell him that
destiny is very wicked."

213
00:29:43,378 --> 00:29:51,378
"The nature weeps by stealth
on my condition."

214
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:56,988
"My heart broke.."

215
00:30:03,937 --> 00:30:10,464
At last you have come.
I knew that you will surely come.

216
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:12,569
Who are you?

217
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,319
Didn't you recognise me?

218
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,720
No.

219
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:22,152
You have forgotten me? I have
not forgotten you, Suraj.

220
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:24,444
How do you know my name?

221
00:30:25,761 --> 00:30:28,382
I know everything about you.

222
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:32,822
Today you have returned to
this place after ten years.

223
00:30:33,444 --> 00:30:35,569
After becoming a great artist.

224
00:30:37,758 --> 00:30:39,903
But, who are you?

225
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:45,853
Me? I am a girl.

226
00:30:50,486 --> 00:30:54,402
You here alone, so late at night.
Aren't you scared?

227
00:30:54,861 --> 00:30:57,528
Scared? You are with me.

228
00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:00,819
I was never scared with you.

229
00:31:04,757 --> 00:31:05,757
Go.

230
00:31:06,857 --> 00:31:09,337
Someone is waiting for you.

231
00:31:17,382 --> 00:31:18,903
My name is Kiran.

232
00:31:21,685 --> 00:31:23,847
You wanted to ask my name, right?

233
00:31:24,914 --> 00:31:25,945
Yes.

234
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:29,154
- Why were you so late?
- I met a girl there.

235
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:31,819
A girl? So late at night?

236
00:32:32,648 --> 00:32:38,272
I was also surprised.
She was a strange girl.

237
00:33:33,914 --> 00:33:35,875
- Wonderful!
- Thank you.

238
00:33:36,033 --> 00:33:39,268
Rita, tell him to make
my picture too.

239
00:33:39,483 --> 00:33:41,444
Drat, the naughty girl!

240
00:34:20,315 --> 00:34:21,315
Wow!

241
00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:33,903
Very nice!

242
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,277
What do you think about
these pictures?

243
00:35:34,748 --> 00:35:37,361
The more I praise the lesser it is.

244
00:35:39,456 --> 00:35:43,236
Wow! Only the life is lacking.

245
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,980
Thank you.

246
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,042
This is no new thing.

247
00:35:50,929 --> 00:35:53,903
Your fingers always had this magic.

248
00:35:56,152 --> 00:35:57,152
Yes?

249
00:35:57,605 --> 00:36:00,989
- Are all your paintings here in this exhibition?
- Yes

250
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:04,611
Wrong. One painting is not here.

251
00:36:06,229 --> 00:36:07,229
Which one?

252
00:36:07,506 --> 00:36:09,333
The one which is not finished.

253
00:36:11,382 --> 00:36:13,444
The one which you had started
a long time ago.

254
00:36:14,395 --> 00:36:16,236
But couldn't complete it till now.

255
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:19,861
How do you know?

256
00:36:46,923 --> 00:36:48,066
I will leave.

257
00:36:54,404 --> 00:36:58,464
He has made your picture
very beautifully.

258
00:39:12,965 --> 00:39:14,245
Hey, where did that vehicle go?

259
00:39:14,488 --> 00:39:16,228
- Which vehicle, sir?
- That horse cart.

260
00:39:16,348 --> 00:39:17,632
The one which had come out
of this tunnel just now.

261
00:39:17,656 --> 00:39:20,533
From the tunnel. No horse cart
came out of it, master.

262
00:39:20,709 --> 00:39:22,788
I am working here since morning.

263
00:39:24,819 --> 00:39:26,345
No, horse cart came out!

264
00:42:04,308 --> 00:42:08,246
"Great master, if you permit us."

265
00:42:08,603 --> 00:42:12,849
"Then we will say this
to the entire world."

266
00:42:12,889 --> 00:42:16,560
"Great master, if you permit us."

267
00:42:17,228 --> 00:42:21,429
"Then we will say this
to the entire world."

268
00:42:21,569 --> 00:42:25,794
"We are smitten by your attitude."

269
00:42:25,914 --> 00:42:29,574
"Who have said, that we are scared?"

270
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:33,952
"Great master, if you permit us."

271
00:42:34,582 --> 00:42:38,775
"Then we will say this
to the entire world."

272
00:42:38,815 --> 00:42:41,244
"Great master.

273
00:43:00,622 --> 00:43:04,528
"Why shouldn't we say
that love is God?"

274
00:43:04,722 --> 00:43:09,152
"What is it, if it is not reality?"

275
00:43:09,192 --> 00:43:13,149
"Why shouldn't we say
that love is God?"

276
00:43:13,473 --> 00:43:17,934
"What is it, if it is not reality?"

277
00:43:18,403 --> 00:43:22,430
"Oh darling, place a bet."

278
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:26,560
"I have handed over
my heart to you."

279
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:30,918
"There is great enjoyment
to walk in stealth."

280
00:43:31,129 --> 00:43:35,033
"There is fun by getting
struck and manage again."

281
00:43:35,455 --> 00:43:39,193
"Great master, if you permit us."

282
00:43:39,837 --> 00:43:44,398
"Then we will say this
to the entire world."

283
00:43:44,468 --> 00:43:46,745
"Great master.

284
00:44:05,567 --> 00:44:13,567
"Just smile and see who
is sitting near you."

285
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:22,402
"Just smile and see who
is sitting near you."

286
00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:27,528
"Oh darling, place a bet."

287
00:44:27,694 --> 00:44:31,778
"I have handed over
my heart to you."

288
00:44:31,861 --> 00:44:36,110
"These lowered eyes
had been enchanting."

289
00:44:36,366 --> 00:44:40,444
"We didn't know when it was unfair."

290
00:44:40,842 --> 00:44:44,443
"Great master, if you permit us."

291
00:44:45,146 --> 00:44:49,324
"Then we will say this
to the entire world."

292
00:44:49,491 --> 00:44:53,533
"We are smitten by your attitude."

293
00:44:53,762 --> 00:44:57,584
"Who have said, that we are scared?"

294
00:44:58,314 --> 00:45:01,990
"Great master, if you permit us."

295
00:45:02,193 --> 00:45:03,193
- Suraj.
- Yes.

296
00:45:03,231 --> 00:45:04,545
In the party you are
giving tomorrow..

297
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:06,653
Why don't we fix their
program in it?

298
00:45:06,736 --> 00:45:08,394
But the fact is..

299
00:45:34,196 --> 00:45:41,242
"Every part of heart...

300
00:45:41,768 --> 00:45:49,657
prays."

301
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:57,357
"My heart broke, but you didn't...

302
00:45:57,738 --> 00:46:04,002
hear its sound."

303
00:46:04,218 --> 00:46:10,230
"But you didn't hear the sound."

304
00:46:10,652 --> 00:46:16,396
"But you didn't hear the sound."

305
00:46:16,991 --> 00:46:21,334
"But you didn't hear the sound."

306
00:46:24,298 --> 00:46:32,298
"Every part of heart prays."

307
00:46:34,582 --> 00:46:42,582
"My heart broke, but you
didn't hear its sound."

308
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:48,957
"But you didn't hear the sound."

309
00:46:49,148 --> 00:46:54,817
"Every part of heart."

310
00:47:03,956 --> 00:47:11,956
"I couldn't understand
what my fault was."

311
00:47:18,482 --> 00:47:26,482
"Why did I come to
your party O world?

312
00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:41,269
"I couldn't understand
what my fault was."

313
00:47:43,212 --> 00:47:51,212
"Why did I come to your
party, O world?

314
00:47:52,960 --> 00:48:00,960
"No how many more births
will separation burn me?"

315
00:48:02,853 --> 00:48:10,853
"My heart broke, but you
didn't hear its sound."

316
00:48:12,424 --> 00:48:17,095
"But you didn't hear the sound."

317
00:48:17,215 --> 00:48:21,964
"But you didn't hear the sound."

318
00:48:22,084 --> 00:48:26,409
"But you didn't hear the sound."

319
00:48:46,288 --> 00:48:49,778
That girl. Where is that girl
who was with you in the boat?

320
00:48:50,212 --> 00:48:52,130
- Why?
- I want to meet her.

321
00:48:52,644 --> 00:48:54,942
- Why?
- I want to know who she is.

322
00:48:58,152 --> 00:49:01,008
She is my daughter, Kiran.

323
00:49:03,853 --> 00:49:04,853
Your daughter?

324
00:49:05,441 --> 00:49:07,199
You want to know, where she lives.

325
00:49:07,772 --> 00:49:11,776
In the old mansion
near the old road.

326
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,684
But nobody lives there.

327
00:49:14,245 --> 00:49:18,236
Who says so? I live there.
My daughter lives there.

328
00:49:18,501 --> 00:49:23,319
And some and some ghosts
live there too.

329
00:51:24,295 --> 00:51:25,630
Who are you?

330
00:51:26,486 --> 00:51:27,982
I want to meet Kiran.

331
00:51:28,659 --> 00:51:30,799
You can't meet her.

332
00:51:31,766 --> 00:51:32,449
Why?

333
00:51:32,641 --> 00:51:38,666
- Don't argue. Go back.
- Wait.

334
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,867
Tell Kiran that there is
a party tomorrow night.

335
00:51:44,346 --> 00:51:46,799
I will wait for her
at sharp at 8:30.

336
00:51:49,362 --> 00:51:52,451
She will get your message.

337
00:51:55,535 --> 00:51:56,741
My name is Suraj.

338
00:51:59,014 --> 00:52:00,014
I know.

339
00:52:00,356 --> 00:52:04,641
Who will come to invite
Kiran besides Suraj?

340
00:52:38,142 --> 00:52:42,444
Well, friends. Our research
couldn't be completed till now.

341
00:52:42,699 --> 00:52:45,139
Yes, we have just come to know..

342
00:52:45,179 --> 00:52:48,686
That there was dancing
girl called Kiranmai.

343
00:52:49,928 --> 00:52:51,653
This is her statue.

344
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:54,806
Professor, can you tell us how
old are these monuments?

345
00:52:54,858 --> 00:53:01,685
Well, maybe 2,000 years old.
Come on, friends.

346
00:53:01,805 --> 00:53:03,056
- Yes.
- Come.

347
00:53:05,087 --> 00:53:06,654
Come here, Rakesh. Come.

348
00:53:07,524 --> 00:53:11,194
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Come on. Come. Come.

349
00:53:13,662 --> 00:53:16,736
- Come here.
- What about this, professor?

350
00:53:18,484 --> 00:53:21,778
This..

351
00:53:37,415 --> 00:53:40,187
Guide them, I will just come.
Pardon me friends.

352
00:53:40,227 --> 00:53:42,919
- I will be back in a jiffy.
- Take your time. - Bye.

353
00:53:44,075 --> 00:53:46,627
Gentlemen, about this statue..

354
00:53:50,785 --> 00:53:52,882
Rita? You her?

355
00:53:54,434 --> 00:53:55,594
What is the matter, daughter?

356
00:53:56,042 --> 00:53:59,625
Daddy, I am very tense.

357
00:54:00,507 --> 00:54:04,611
There is a girl on whom
Suraj is very interested.

358
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:06,903
Who is she?

359
00:54:07,348 --> 00:54:12,224
I don't know. She is
a strange girl...

360
00:54:13,872 --> 00:54:16,178
and beautiful too.

361
00:54:17,541 --> 00:54:20,531
- She can never be beautiful than you.
- But Daddy..

362
00:54:20,651 --> 00:54:23,152
You are getting tensed
uselessly. Go home.

363
00:54:23,309 --> 00:54:25,336
Maybe that girl will come to
the party too in the evening.

364
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,778
I will come too. There is
no need to get flustered.

365
00:54:28,345 --> 00:54:29,653
Go. Go, home.

366
00:54:55,696 --> 00:54:57,755
I want you. I want you.

367
00:54:58,668 --> 00:55:01,226
- Excuse me. Daddy.
- What is the matter, daughter?

368
00:55:01,278 --> 00:55:02,615
This is that girl.

369
00:55:37,908 --> 00:55:40,612
You have come? I knew that
you will surely come.

370
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:42,899
You will surely come. Come.

371
00:55:48,463 --> 00:55:50,498
Professor, this is Kiran.

372
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:52,270
Kiranmai?

373
00:55:54,473 --> 00:55:57,912
No, only Kiran.

374
00:55:59,462 --> 00:56:00,693
Greetings.

375
00:56:09,543 --> 00:56:10,823
Where did you get these bangles?

376
00:56:11,813 --> 00:56:15,458
- These are mine.
- The design is very old.

377
00:56:15,629 --> 00:56:19,404
- Yes, 2,000 years.
- How do you know?

378
00:56:20,609 --> 00:56:24,028
- I wear them, that's why.
- But why do you wear them?

379
00:56:24,412 --> 00:56:29,111
I like them. I want to keep the
old culture of my country alive.

380
00:56:29,231 --> 00:56:31,244
Have you comet o the
party or to argue?

381
00:56:32,364 --> 00:56:35,445
Professor, Kiran wants to
see my studio. Come, Kiran.

382
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,612
No, later.

383
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:48,944
Strange, professor.
These bangles.. But..

384
00:56:49,362 --> 00:56:52,445
- But how is that possible?
- I am thinking the same.

385
00:56:53,312 --> 00:56:56,487
Rakesh, wait here. I will just come.

386
00:57:13,195 --> 00:57:14,362
I am thirsty.

387
00:57:46,113 --> 00:57:47,113
Blast!

388
00:57:53,135 --> 00:57:55,829
Have you come to this city recently?

389
00:57:56,653 --> 00:57:59,767
- 2,000 years ago.
- Don't joke.

390
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:02,597
I am not habituated to joke.

391
00:58:10,183 --> 00:58:14,195
I have heard that you live in
that old mansion. Is it true?

392
00:58:15,084 --> 00:58:17,528
- Yes.
- Why do you live there?

393
00:58:19,918 --> 00:58:25,433
I love old things.
They remind me of olden times.

394
00:58:25,818 --> 00:58:29,044
- Olden times?
- 2,000 years ago.

395
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,964
She doesn't seem to
be 2,000 years old.

396
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:38,639
May be she works in
some theatre company.

397
00:58:38,709 --> 00:58:44,299
It is also possible that she has
run away from some lunatic asylum.

398
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:50,980
Rita!

399
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,479
- You have no right to make fun of Kiran.
- Fun?

400
00:58:55,937 --> 00:58:59,478
We just want to know
who and what she is.

401
00:58:59,598 --> 00:59:03,352
It is enough for you to know
that Kiran is my guest.

402
00:59:13,523 --> 00:59:15,236
Ladies and gentlemen.

403
00:59:15,296 --> 00:59:18,892
Today in our party
a person has come..

404
00:59:19,069 --> 00:59:22,295
Who is a living example of the
lifestyle 2,000 years old.

405
00:59:22,415 --> 00:59:26,226
But I am sorry that she
is a stranger to us all.

406
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:32,336
I am sure that even you want
to know that who, what and..

407
00:59:32,388 --> 00:59:34,609
Rita! What misbehaviour is this?

408
00:59:37,078 --> 00:59:39,612
Who wants to know, who I am?

409
00:59:55,234 --> 01:00:03,234
"Maybe I am a stranger for you."

410
01:00:20,006 --> 01:00:28,006
"Maybe I am a stranger for you."

411
01:00:29,455 --> 01:00:35,645
"But the moon and
the stars know me."

412
01:00:35,709 --> 01:00:41,728
"All these views know me."

413
01:00:42,024 --> 01:00:48,061
"Maybe I am a stranger for you."

414
01:00:48,302 --> 01:00:54,019
"But the moon and
the stars know me."

415
01:00:54,411 --> 01:01:01,490
"All these views know me."

416
01:01:31,922 --> 01:01:38,019
"Every leaf here is
my secret keeper."

417
01:01:41,215 --> 01:01:47,520
"I have placed tongue
on every molecule."

418
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:56,613
"Every leaf here is
my secret keeper."

419
01:01:56,834 --> 01:02:02,818
"I have placed tongue
on every molecule."

420
01:02:03,062 --> 01:02:08,829
"Everyone asks me today
the same thing."

421
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:15,097
"Why have my darling
forgotten love."

422
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:22,061
"I won't be pained even if
you have forgotten me."

423
01:02:22,496 --> 01:02:28,300
"Because everyone in pain knows me."

424
01:02:28,651 --> 01:02:34,979
"All these views know me."

425
01:03:05,278 --> 01:03:11,992
"You were lost in the
paths of disloyalty."

426
01:03:14,628 --> 01:03:21,112
"In every step there were
signs of my loyalty."

427
01:03:23,878 --> 01:03:29,819
"You were lost in the
paths of disloyalty."

428
01:03:30,198 --> 01:03:35,899
"In every step there were
signs of my loyalty."

429
01:03:36,218 --> 01:03:42,164
"You left me breaking all promises."

430
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:48,306
"My love was left as a story."

431
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:55,384
"The promises which you couldn't...

432
01:03:55,635 --> 01:04:01,464
keep know me."

433
01:04:01,827 --> 01:04:08,086
"All these views know me."

434
01:04:32,328 --> 01:04:33,686
Wait!

435
01:04:34,995 --> 01:04:36,843
Why do you want to go away from me?

436
01:04:38,098 --> 01:04:39,589
Why do you want to come close to me?

437
01:04:40,616 --> 01:04:45,219
I? I.. I want to make your painting.

438
01:04:46,505 --> 01:04:47,942
Only painting?

439
01:05:00,745 --> 01:05:03,985
- Meet me tomorrow, in the after noon.
- Where?

440
01:05:05,042 --> 01:05:09,240
Walk on the road which goes
up to the heel by the lake.

441
01:05:10,028 --> 01:05:15,996
Stop where there are a
lot of rocks. And wait.

442
01:06:27,895 --> 01:06:29,220
Watchman!

443
01:06:30,696 --> 01:06:32,319
Watchman!

444
01:06:32,924 --> 01:06:34,889
- Watchman!
- Yes, master.

445
01:06:34,965 --> 01:06:37,475
Where did this statue disappear?

446
01:06:38,824 --> 01:06:42,129
Statue? I don't know, master.

447
01:06:42,387 --> 01:06:44,433
Did any outside person come?

448
01:06:44,699 --> 01:06:46,782
Here? Outside person?

449
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:48,972
No outside person has
come here, master.

450
01:06:49,401 --> 01:06:50,537
No one has come.

451
01:06:53,977 --> 01:06:54,990
Surprising.

452
01:06:55,499 --> 01:06:58,116
How can such a big statue
disappear suddenly?

453
01:07:05,527 --> 01:07:08,242
After 2,000 years.

454
01:07:10,664 --> 01:07:12,455
No. No.

455
01:07:12,978 --> 01:07:14,241
This is impossible.

456
01:07:14,845 --> 01:07:18,919
This is impossible.
This is impossible.

457
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:33,294
Professor. Professor. See this
is the history of those ruins.

458
01:07:33,721 --> 01:07:34,977
In the old books of Sanskrit..

459
01:07:35,024 --> 01:07:36,907
You know I don't know Sanskrit.

460
01:07:37,109 --> 01:07:38,922
- Translate it and make me understand.
- Yes.

461
01:07:39,781 --> 01:07:41,771
According to this book
there was a city..

462
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,520
Called Chandrika Nagar
2,000 years back.

463
01:07:43,785 --> 01:07:46,227
- Is something written about that statue?
- No.

464
01:07:46,385 --> 01:07:49,065
But something is written about that
room where we found that statue.

465
01:07:49,382 --> 01:07:51,110
It was the studio of a sculptor.

466
01:07:51,277 --> 01:07:53,054
- He used to love a royal dancer.
- Yes.

467
01:07:53,174 --> 01:07:55,762
And that royal dancer's
name was Kiranmai.

468
01:07:56,249 --> 01:07:57,491
Kiranmai!

469
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:01,449
What is written about her?
Read it. Read it. Read it.

470
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:04,199
That someone murdered her one day.

471
01:08:04,466 --> 01:08:07,449
- And it was left as a secret.
- Yes.

472
01:08:09,948 --> 01:08:10,987
That is what is written.

473
01:08:54,002 --> 01:08:56,291
You wanted to meet me. I have come.

474
01:08:57,490 --> 01:08:58,824
Why are you surprised?

475
01:08:59,162 --> 01:09:03,462
You have as suddenly as
someone comes in a dream.

476
01:09:04,814 --> 01:09:07,157
Did I use to come in your dreams?

477
01:09:08,107 --> 01:09:09,677
You have started to come.

478
01:09:11,692 --> 01:09:13,594
Come here. Sit.

479
01:09:17,027 --> 01:09:21,234
Look. That's it.
Stay like that. Don't move.

480
01:09:47,781 --> 01:09:50,116
This picture will make
me immortal in world.

481
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:53,888
Only if it is finished, then?

482
01:09:56,065 --> 01:09:58,366
The way one of your other pictures
is still uncompleted.

483
01:09:58,803 --> 01:09:59,918
If it is also left incomplete..

484
01:09:59,942 --> 01:10:02,407
It won't be. I will complete it.

485
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:06,781
You were so stubborn even before.

486
01:10:09,235 --> 01:10:10,235
When?

487
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:17,198
It is stubbornness. To cut
rocks and make idols out of it.

488
01:10:19,634 --> 01:10:20,910
Make idols?

489
01:10:21,195 --> 01:10:22,296
Idols of stone.

490
01:10:22,721 --> 01:10:24,759
The one who have neither
a heart nor emotions.

491
01:10:24,995 --> 01:10:28,491
Even your heart becomes a
stone working with stones.

492
01:10:29,321 --> 01:10:34,133
Kiran, what are you saying?
I only make paintings.

493
01:10:41,187 --> 01:10:42,642
Is the painting over?

494
01:10:46,863 --> 01:10:50,488
No, I don't know what has
happened to me today?

495
01:10:52,492 --> 01:10:54,074
Today the fog is shifting.

496
01:10:58,334 --> 01:10:59,533
Look there.

497
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:17,949
"This is the place."

498
01:11:18,619 --> 01:11:23,074
"This is the weather."

499
01:11:23,907 --> 01:11:31,907
"This is where we two have met."

500
01:11:34,782 --> 01:11:38,950
"This is the place."

501
01:11:39,039 --> 01:11:42,835
"This is the weather."

502
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:50,886
"This is where we two have met."

503
01:11:51,342 --> 01:11:58,872
"How can I forget them?"

504
01:11:59,504 --> 01:12:07,261
"This is where we two have met."

505
01:12:24,382 --> 01:12:32,382
"Here you have taken my
hand in your hand..

506
01:12:32,673 --> 01:12:40,623
And had promised never
to get estranged."

507
01:12:40,961 --> 01:12:48,376
"You had hugged me...

508
01:12:49,089 --> 01:12:57,089
and told me that
I am yours forever."

509
01:12:57,577 --> 01:13:05,405
"My loyalties will never decrease."

510
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:13,478
"This is where we two have met."

511
01:13:14,030 --> 01:13:18,037
"This is the place."

512
01:13:18,157 --> 01:13:22,005
"This is the weather."

513
01:13:22,226 --> 01:13:30,226
"This is where we two have met."

514
01:14:07,366 --> 01:14:08,782
Kiran!

515
01:14:13,329 --> 01:14:14,740
Kiran!

516
01:14:29,077 --> 01:14:30,153
Kiran!

517
01:14:33,684 --> 01:14:35,116
What happened to you?

518
01:14:38,573 --> 01:14:42,420
This fog. I hate it.

519
01:14:43,902 --> 01:14:46,324
Someone becomes far away
even if he is close.

520
01:14:46,775 --> 01:14:50,491
He gets estranged.
Sometimes forever.

521
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:58,282
When will this fog shift?

522
01:15:05,076 --> 01:15:06,407
Give me your hand.

523
01:15:07,604 --> 01:15:08,907
You will leave it.

524
01:15:10,061 --> 01:15:13,906
Never. I can leave everything
in the world.

525
01:15:14,782 --> 01:15:17,491
I can leave the world. Not you.

526
01:15:22,279 --> 01:15:23,279
Yes, Kiran.

527
01:15:30,907 --> 01:15:32,032
Suraj.

528
01:15:32,885 --> 01:15:33,910
Kiran.

529
01:16:49,763 --> 01:16:52,175
Let it remain. It is very cold.

530
01:16:53,032 --> 01:16:57,924
- And.. And you?
- The fire is there.

531
01:17:02,355 --> 01:17:05,931
You are wet. If something
happens to you.

532
01:17:05,971 --> 01:17:09,898
- Let it happen.
- Don't you even care for your life?

533
01:17:10,114 --> 01:17:18,114
No, my life is yours now.
I have to live and die for you.

534
01:17:20,222 --> 01:17:21,430
Even die.

535
01:17:24,241 --> 01:17:25,241
Yes.

536
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:42,719
"My life, I have loved you."

537
01:17:43,903 --> 01:17:51,903
"If you want you can
even take my life."

538
01:17:52,840 --> 01:18:00,840
"When you are near me, I
have everything with me."

539
01:18:01,793 --> 01:18:09,793
"What is life? You can
even take my honour."

540
01:18:10,754 --> 01:18:17,824
"My life, I have loved you."

541
01:18:22,035 --> 01:18:30,035
"I had regarded you
the God of love."

542
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:39,110
"You tell me what you
regard me to be."

543
01:18:39,919 --> 01:18:47,919
"What is life; it is only
the benevolence of love."

544
01:18:49,123 --> 01:18:57,123
"I have really regarded
pain as medicine."

545
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:05,983
"My life, I have loved you."

546
01:19:06,917 --> 01:19:14,917
"If you want you can
even take my life."

547
01:19:15,691 --> 01:19:23,691
"My life, I have loved you."

548
01:19:26,699 --> 01:19:34,699
"That is the heart which always
sings songs of loyalty."

549
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:43,729
"Go on loving the one it loves."

550
01:19:44,714 --> 01:19:52,714
"The moment when my lover's
hand is on mine..

551
01:19:53,641 --> 01:20:01,641
Is better than to live
for a hundred years."

552
01:20:02,621 --> 01:20:10,621
"My life, I have loved you."

553
01:20:11,527 --> 01:20:19,527
"If you want you can
even take my life."

554
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:28,460
"When you are near me, I
have everything with me."

555
01:20:29,319 --> 01:20:37,319
"What is life? You can
even take my honour."

556
01:20:38,371 --> 01:20:46,371
"My life, I have loved you."

557
01:20:52,321 --> 01:20:54,782
Junior master, where were
you the entire night?

558
01:20:54,902 --> 01:20:57,407
We were worried searching for you.

559
01:20:57,857 --> 01:21:00,734
There is no need to be worried
about me in the future.

560
01:21:01,585 --> 01:21:02,824
Suraj.

561
01:21:08,589 --> 01:21:10,161
Where were you the entire night?

562
01:21:10,571 --> 01:21:12,661
I was trapped at a place
in the rain and storm.

563
01:21:16,077 --> 01:21:17,116
Alone?

564
01:21:18,617 --> 01:21:22,491
No, even Kiran was with me.

565
01:21:26,574 --> 01:21:30,516
You, Suraj.

566
01:21:33,559 --> 01:21:36,348
Maybe I have not told
you, the statue..

567
01:21:36,939 --> 01:21:39,375
Have found in the ruins.

568
01:21:40,885 --> 01:21:44,845
Its face resembles Kiran a lot.

569
01:21:46,262 --> 01:21:50,521
And do you know, what is
written underneath it?

570
01:21:52,133 --> 01:21:53,741
Kiranmai.

571
01:21:55,422 --> 01:21:57,081
It is just a co-incidence.

572
01:21:59,593 --> 01:22:04,990
Kiranmai was a royal dancer.
She was murdered.

573
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:12,252
Do you know the day that
girl came to the party..

574
01:22:12,475 --> 01:22:15,695
That very day that statue
disappeared from the ruins.

575
01:22:15,795 --> 01:22:17,874
I can make you believe that Kiran..

576
01:22:17,994 --> 01:22:20,834
Is a beautiful, healthy
and a living girl.

577
01:22:21,179 --> 01:22:24,818
My Kiran is not related to your
that Kiran or her soul.

578
01:22:26,215 --> 01:22:28,346
- Your Kiran?
- Yes?

579
01:22:31,159 --> 01:22:35,031
I mean I know her a lot.

580
01:22:39,002 --> 01:22:40,350
Check this list.

581
01:22:41,186 --> 01:22:45,438
If any of your acquaintances names
are missing then add it.

582
01:22:46,145 --> 01:22:47,157
What kind of list it is?

583
01:22:47,375 --> 01:22:49,698
Of the guest coming to your wedding.

584
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:52,702
The date is fixed for
the 8th of next month.

585
01:22:52,822 --> 01:22:59,278
Professor. I.. I don't want
to get married so soon.

586
01:22:59,638 --> 01:23:03,693
Soon? Rita has been engaged
to you years before.

587
01:23:04,561 --> 01:23:06,758
Still, I need some time.

588
01:23:07,781 --> 01:23:10,708
All right. I will come
again tomorrow evening.

589
01:23:11,575 --> 01:23:16,608
Decide it. I cannot even keep
my young daughter at home.

590
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:21,230
Professor.

591
01:23:21,283 --> 01:23:24,698
If I decided against marriage, then?

592
01:23:26,231 --> 01:23:28,980
Then listen carefully,
you will have..

593
01:23:29,052 --> 01:23:33,569
To leave all your wealth,
property and land.

594
01:23:34,839 --> 01:23:37,138
Your late father had decided
to make my daughter..

595
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:40,280
His daughter-in-law.
And not only that.

596
01:23:41,144 --> 01:23:43,887
He has even handed me
the responsibility..

597
01:23:44,195 --> 01:23:46,942
To decide about your welfare.

598
01:24:01,486 --> 01:24:04,512
Junior master, this letter
was given to me..

599
01:24:04,552 --> 01:24:06,800
By elder master
during his illness.

600
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:09,021
And had told me that give
this letter to my son..

601
01:24:09,141 --> 01:24:12,321
When he is in great
problems some day.

602
01:24:18,651 --> 01:24:21,684
'Son Suraj.
I am missing you a lot today.'

603
01:24:22,283 --> 01:24:24,587
'Maybe this is my last
letter for you.'

604
01:24:24,899 --> 01:24:26,549
'The doctors have raised
their hands.'

605
01:24:26,833 --> 01:24:28,698
'And I am just a few days left.'

606
01:24:29,406 --> 01:24:32,407
'Today your professor uncle had
come to meet me with Rita.'

607
01:24:33,092 --> 01:24:34,657
'I had given him the oath
to make his daughter Rita..

608
01:24:34,681 --> 01:24:36,121
The daughter-in-law of my house.'

609
01:24:36,688 --> 01:24:38,282
'Your mother wants the same.'

610
01:24:39,246 --> 01:24:42,491
'This is my last wish that
you get married to Rita.'

611
01:24:42,963 --> 01:24:44,910
'Love, father.'

612
01:24:53,591 --> 01:24:58,366
No, this is not possible.
I won't let this happen.

613
01:24:58,723 --> 01:25:00,180
I won't let this happen.

614
01:25:19,748 --> 01:25:21,215
Rita.

615
01:25:21,801 --> 01:25:24,368
- Today the professor had come to my home.
- I know.

616
01:25:24,904 --> 01:25:27,297
He has given me time
till tomorrow evening..

617
01:25:27,417 --> 01:25:30,188
- To decide about marriage.
- I know that too.

618
01:25:31,714 --> 01:25:33,501
And the decision is in your hands.

619
01:25:35,134 --> 01:25:38,169
I have been engaged to you long ago.

620
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,043
But marriage is
a question of entire life.

621
01:25:41,632 --> 01:25:43,687
There should be
love in the two hearts.

622
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:50,252
Rita, there a few things,
where the heart cannot be controlled.

623
01:25:50,708 --> 01:25:51,709
Like, Kiran.

624
01:25:52,613 --> 01:25:54,918
Yes, I cannot stay alive without her.

625
01:25:59,043 --> 01:26:00,252
What do you want from me?

626
01:26:00,556 --> 01:26:03,501
- If you disagree to marry me..
- So that you can marry Kiran.

627
01:26:07,492 --> 01:26:10,859
- Does she know we are engaged?
- Yes.

628
01:26:12,752 --> 01:26:14,719
Still she flirts with you.

629
01:26:16,775 --> 01:26:18,563
Do you know what
such girls are known as?

630
01:26:18,683 --> 01:26:20,797
Rita! I can't hear
anything against Kiran.

631
01:26:20,917 --> 01:26:23,672
You will have to listen. I hate her.

632
01:26:24,336 --> 01:26:27,273
She had trapped you by
exhibiting her beauty and youth.

633
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:28,099
Rita!

634
01:26:28,219 --> 01:26:30,865
She is a lowly, cheat
and a dishonourable girl.

635
01:26:40,282 --> 01:26:44,127
She had snatched both
your heart and mind.

636
01:26:46,457 --> 01:26:47,793
You can leave now.

637
01:27:52,195 --> 01:27:53,417
Wait!

638
01:27:57,665 --> 01:28:01,417
- You?
- You want to lose your life. Look down.

639
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:11,672
As it is there is no
meaning to life without you.

640
01:28:13,694 --> 01:28:15,739
Do you believe in rebirth?

641
01:28:17,262 --> 01:28:18,262
What?

642
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:22,725
Will you wait for
me till the next birth..

643
01:28:22,845 --> 01:28:25,148
If we can't meet in this birth?

644
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:28,543
No, I will make you
mine in this very birth.

645
01:28:34,672 --> 01:28:37,491
- And the one you have to marry.
- I can leave her.

646
01:28:37,928 --> 01:28:40,031
I can leave everything to get you.

647
01:28:41,610 --> 01:28:42,835
Can you die?

648
01:28:44,749 --> 01:28:46,549
Do you want to test me?

649
01:28:47,751 --> 01:28:50,413
Not now. When the time comes.

650
01:28:50,952 --> 01:28:52,593
That time will never come now.

651
01:28:52,913 --> 01:28:57,435
Kiran, can you come tomorrow
morning where the professor works?

652
01:28:58,753 --> 01:28:59,753
Why?

653
01:29:00,181 --> 01:29:03,185
Tomorrow I will tell him
my decision in front of you.

654
01:29:06,021 --> 01:29:07,417
I will surely come.

655
01:29:07,923 --> 01:29:10,761
- You go now.
- Come, I will drop you of. - No.

656
01:29:11,303 --> 01:29:15,759
I will go myself.
Wait for me at 9 o' clock at night.

657
01:29:16,195 --> 01:29:19,259
- But I..
- Tomorrow at 9.

658
01:29:40,053 --> 01:29:42,823
Rita. Rita. What have you done, Rita?

659
01:29:43,202 --> 01:29:44,318
Have you gone mad?

660
01:29:44,617 --> 01:29:46,543
- Professor, take Rita from here at once.
- But..

661
01:29:46,663 --> 01:29:49,709
Hurry. There is no time to think.
Please. Please.

662
01:30:10,417 --> 01:30:12,619
- What happened?
- Everything is finished.

663
01:30:13,043 --> 01:30:16,772
- Did you get the corpse?
- No, we won't find it either.

664
01:30:17,751 --> 01:30:19,297
Right behind the place she was shot..

665
01:30:19,482 --> 01:30:21,417
There was ravine 2,000 feet deep.

666
01:30:25,711 --> 01:30:27,501
We should inform the police.

667
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:30,549
What are you saying?
Rita is your daughter.

668
01:30:31,417 --> 01:30:34,126
Yes, but she had committed a crime.

669
01:30:34,605 --> 01:30:36,001
She has committed a murder.

670
01:30:46,168 --> 01:30:47,252
Professor.

671
01:30:49,414 --> 01:30:51,107
I have come to tell you something.

672
01:30:53,803 --> 01:30:57,076
- I, I have decided.
- What?

673
01:30:58,626 --> 01:31:01,312
I have decided to marry Kiran.

674
01:31:09,429 --> 01:31:13,903
I have called her here.
She will come soon.

675
01:31:18,016 --> 01:31:22,793
Mr. Suraj, Kiran is among those
girls who promise but doesn't come.

676
01:31:23,357 --> 01:31:27,451
- They play with the emotions of people like you but..
- But?

677
01:32:02,359 --> 01:32:06,544
No! This is impossible!
This is impossible!

678
01:32:07,876 --> 01:32:11,584
Daddy, this girl is not
human but surely some ghost.

679
01:32:43,289 --> 01:32:44,726
Rita.

680
01:32:44,913 --> 01:32:45,913
Child.

681
01:32:57,617 --> 01:32:58,617
Rita.

682
01:33:29,789 --> 01:33:30,835
Professor.

683
01:33:37,429 --> 01:33:38,902
How is Rita?

684
01:33:39,022 --> 01:33:42,144
She has gained consciousness but..

685
01:33:42,264 --> 01:33:43,526
But?

686
01:33:45,334 --> 01:33:47,173
She isn't out of danger till now.

687
01:33:57,942 --> 01:34:01,751
Professor I have not heard
such a strange incident till date.

688
01:34:02,679 --> 01:34:06,042
Whatever you have said is impossible.
It cannot happen.

689
01:34:06,417 --> 01:34:10,160
But it has happened. Inspector
my daughter is in the hospital.

690
01:34:10,794 --> 01:34:12,390
I want to reach
the root of this matter.

691
01:34:12,510 --> 01:34:15,671
I want to know the reality.
Please, come with me.

692
01:34:16,037 --> 01:34:17,043
Please.

693
01:34:42,509 --> 01:34:43,913
That girl lives here.

694
01:34:45,870 --> 01:34:49,452
Professor,
I am the in-charge of this area.

695
01:34:50,157 --> 01:34:54,381
No one has lived in this
mansion since the last 50 years.

696
01:34:54,755 --> 01:34:56,725
We know it very well,
inspector, that girl lives here.

697
01:34:56,749 --> 01:34:59,722
At least, check the place.
Come. Let's go.

698
01:35:09,330 --> 01:35:10,501
Break the door.

699
01:35:48,391 --> 01:35:53,110
Professor, nobody lives in the place,
where snake lives.

700
01:35:53,832 --> 01:35:55,638
Come, let's go back.

701
01:36:19,489 --> 01:36:22,231
Inspector,
he is the father of that very girl.

702
01:36:22,425 --> 01:36:25,590
You people won't let
my daughter live in peace.

703
01:36:26,549 --> 01:36:27,549
Where is your daughter?

704
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:31,396
You won't find her.
Nobody will find her.

705
01:36:31,773 --> 01:36:33,307
Nobody will ever find her.

706
01:36:40,872 --> 01:36:42,881
Inspector, arrest him.

707
01:36:43,241 --> 01:36:46,938
Professor, I know this man well.

708
01:36:47,890 --> 01:36:51,283
He has become mad since
his young daughter has died.

709
01:36:52,464 --> 01:36:53,464
Mad?

710
01:36:53,609 --> 01:36:56,840
- Yes, professor. Come.
- But that girl.

711
01:36:57,137 --> 01:37:02,336
We will find her. We will find
some other way to find her.

712
01:37:03,417 --> 01:37:04,501
Come.

713
01:37:23,425 --> 01:37:24,425
Let me go now.

714
01:37:24,707 --> 01:37:30,044
From now? It is not evening now.
The sun has not set.

715
01:37:31,139 --> 01:37:32,470
Then how can Kiran (light) go.

716
01:37:32,590 --> 01:37:34,772
Because the Suraj (sun) is disloyal.

717
01:37:35,417 --> 01:37:39,524
It sets and lives the light back.

718
01:37:40,857 --> 01:37:43,334
The poor thing then wanders about..

719
01:37:43,787 --> 01:37:46,631
Till the night
doesn't envelope her.

720
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:49,868
But as soon as it
is morning the sun..

721
01:37:49,988 --> 01:37:53,978
Comes like crazy after his light.

722
01:37:58,368 --> 01:38:00,567
- We will meet later.
- When?

723
01:38:01,943 --> 01:38:04,968
I don't know. Wait for me.

724
01:38:07,334 --> 01:38:08,334
Kiran!

725
01:38:17,121 --> 01:38:25,121
"Promise me that
you will meet me again."

726
01:38:30,229 --> 01:38:38,229
"Promise me that
you will meet me again."

727
01:38:39,794 --> 01:38:47,794
"Promise one more meeting with me."

728
01:38:49,417 --> 01:38:57,417
"Promise me that
you will meet me again."

729
01:38:58,767 --> 01:39:06,767
"Promise one more meeting with me."

730
01:39:08,327 --> 01:39:16,327
"Promise me that
you will meet me again."

731
01:39:38,903 --> 01:39:44,210
"All the matters of the
heart are still incomplete."

732
01:39:44,443 --> 01:39:48,012
"They are still incomplete."

733
01:39:48,533 --> 01:39:56,533
"One more meeting
is necessary still."

734
01:39:58,022 --> 01:40:03,168
"All the matters of the
heart are still incomplete."

735
01:40:03,606 --> 01:40:07,249
"They are still incomplete."

736
01:40:07,754 --> 01:40:15,754
"One more meeting
is necessary still."

737
01:40:17,273 --> 01:40:25,273
"Promise me your
company for a few moments."

738
01:40:26,679 --> 01:40:34,679
"Promise one more meeting with me."

739
01:40:36,211 --> 01:40:44,211
"Promise me that
you will meet me again."

740
01:41:01,564 --> 01:41:09,564
"Why do tell me the beautiful
secret of your heart?"

741
01:41:11,241 --> 01:41:19,241
"Why do you give me
a new tune, a new song?"

742
01:41:20,578 --> 01:41:28,578
"I am drowned in the storms of love."

743
01:41:30,087 --> 01:41:38,087
"You are just
calling me from the bank."

744
01:41:39,427 --> 01:41:47,427
"Promise me that these emotions
will remain even tomorrow."

745
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:56,672
"Promise one more meeting with me."

746
01:41:58,051 --> 01:42:06,043
"Promise me that
you will meet me again."

747
01:42:07,215 --> 01:42:15,215
"Promise one more meeting with me."

748
01:42:16,561 --> 01:42:24,561
"Promise me that
you will meet me again."

749
01:43:23,702 --> 01:43:25,539
Where the photographs of that girl?

750
01:43:25,729 --> 01:43:27,409
- These are the ones.
- These are the ones?

751
01:43:30,889 --> 01:43:32,270
Only Suraj is in them.

752
01:43:34,103 --> 01:43:37,553
All the photos I have clicked
had both Suraj and Kiran.

753
01:43:47,509 --> 01:43:49,312
Then why is Kiran's photo not here?

754
01:43:49,557 --> 01:43:51,673
Because you cannot take her photo.

755
01:43:52,265 --> 01:43:53,265
What do you mean?

756
01:43:53,316 --> 01:43:55,631
I mean that girl is not human.

757
01:43:57,205 --> 01:43:58,555
Not human?

758
01:43:59,282 --> 01:44:02,773
Even I had suspected it.
I believe it today.

759
01:44:12,272 --> 01:44:15,069
I am taking these photographs,
professor.

760
01:44:15,448 --> 01:44:16,448
Good night.

761
01:44:20,525 --> 01:44:23,005
The inspector is
getting worried unnecessarily.

762
01:44:23,434 --> 01:44:26,224
- And no result will come out.
- Why?

763
01:44:27,705 --> 01:44:30,882
Spirits are things beyond
the reach of law and man.

764
01:44:31,088 --> 01:44:34,350
But spirits doesn't have any form,
it doesn't have a body.

765
01:44:34,607 --> 01:44:38,840
They have the power to select
the body they like and stay in it.

766
01:44:39,252 --> 01:44:44,574
You being a scientist,
believe in all these things?

767
01:44:44,789 --> 01:44:46,766
Yes, I have started to.

768
01:44:47,905 --> 01:44:50,589
I have met an experienced
sage regarding this matter.

769
01:44:50,909 --> 01:44:53,229
He was quite impressed
by what he told me.

770
01:44:53,422 --> 01:44:54,584
What did he tell you?

771
01:44:54,945 --> 01:44:58,313
He said that if someone's
desire stay unfulfilled..

772
01:44:58,433 --> 01:45:02,493
Then his spirit keeps
on roaming after death.

773
01:45:02,873 --> 01:45:07,489
And such a spirit needs the sacrifice
of some life to free itself.

774
01:45:07,733 --> 01:45:13,840
If some man starts to love that
spirit then he surely has to die.

775
01:45:18,130 --> 01:45:19,467
What else did he say?

776
01:45:19,845 --> 01:45:23,723
He said that spirits are
seen on the first moon night.

777
01:45:24,041 --> 01:45:27,073
And they can stay till
the 14th night of the moon.

778
01:45:27,595 --> 01:45:31,026
On the 14th their
victim is dangerously affected.

779
01:45:31,187 --> 01:45:33,426
And that day the
spirit takes someone's life.

780
01:45:33,589 --> 01:45:38,292
Rakesh! How can anyone
believe all this things?

781
01:45:38,874 --> 01:45:42,607
The day Kiran first met Suraj
that day was the first moon night.

782
01:45:46,318 --> 01:45:48,548
Tomorrow is the 14th moon night.

783
01:45:51,810 --> 01:45:54,492
And the last day in Suraj's life.

784
01:45:57,868 --> 01:46:00,187
Professor, please. I believe it.

785
01:46:00,501 --> 01:46:02,420
I fully believe that
Suraj's life is in danger.

786
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:03,546
We have to save him.

787
01:46:03,666 --> 01:46:05,688
No matter what.
We cannot let him die.

788
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:14,400
"My love is such that
even after I die..

789
01:46:18,754 --> 01:46:26,001
I won't allow you to
get out from my arms."

790
01:46:26,250 --> 01:46:33,135
"My love is such that
even after I die..

791
01:46:33,379 --> 01:46:40,417
I won't allow you to
get out from my arms."

792
01:46:40,584 --> 01:46:44,186
"Even if I get heaven."

793
01:46:44,428 --> 01:46:52,428
"I will ask God
you instead of heaven."

794
01:46:55,024 --> 01:46:58,904
"My love is such.."

795
01:47:23,652 --> 01:47:30,759
"The world will keep on changing."

796
01:47:30,879 --> 01:47:37,504
"New tunes of life will be made."

797
01:47:41,578 --> 01:47:48,717
"But our love won't be erased."

798
01:47:48,837 --> 01:47:55,837
"But a thousand excuses
will be made to erase it."

799
01:47:56,136 --> 01:48:03,634
"Reality will always be reality."

800
01:48:03,754 --> 01:48:10,550
"It will never turn into a tale."

801
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:18,013
"My love is such that
even after I die..

802
01:48:18,133 --> 01:48:25,037
I won't allow you to
get out from my arms."

803
01:48:25,292 --> 01:48:28,753
"My love is such.."

804
01:48:46,832 --> 01:48:53,834
"My love is not so helpless, that..

805
01:48:54,058 --> 01:49:00,768
Someone will snatch
you from my arms."

806
01:49:04,879 --> 01:49:11,860
"My heart even doesn't like the...

807
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:18,832
moon light touching your body."

808
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:26,718
"Even if someone meets,
I am taking an oath on you..

809
01:49:26,980 --> 01:49:33,925
My heart will burn."

810
01:49:34,158 --> 01:49:41,085
"My love is such that
even after I die..

811
01:49:41,205 --> 01:49:48,216
I won't allow you to
get out from my arms."

812
01:49:48,471 --> 01:49:52,177
"Even if I get heaven."

813
01:49:52,297 --> 01:50:00,297
"I will ask God you
instead of heaven."

814
01:50:02,799 --> 01:50:06,816
"My love is such.."

815
01:50:15,137 --> 01:50:16,171
You?

816
01:50:21,633 --> 01:50:25,845
Yes, I am waiting for
you since a long time.

817
01:50:26,794 --> 01:50:27,794
Why?

818
01:50:29,257 --> 01:50:30,962
To ask your forgiveness.

819
01:50:33,581 --> 01:50:34,581
Yes?

820
01:50:36,462 --> 01:50:38,852
Suraj, I..

821
01:50:41,147 --> 01:50:47,885
I mean to say, the love for
my daughter had made me selfish.

822
01:50:49,336 --> 01:50:54,670
As your guardian,
I should have thought about your joy.

823
01:50:55,347 --> 01:50:57,919
I, I didn't understand.

824
01:51:00,088 --> 01:51:05,367
It was my mistake that I
tried to force you to marry Rita.

825
01:51:06,438 --> 01:51:08,267
It was my mistake.

826
01:51:09,522 --> 01:51:11,537
You love Kiran.

827
01:51:12,434 --> 01:51:14,442
You will be happy by marrying her.

828
01:51:14,922 --> 01:51:16,221
Professor.

829
01:51:16,774 --> 01:51:20,612
Yes, I don't have any objections now.

830
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:28,162
I bless you that the
joys of the world come to you.

831
01:51:29,223 --> 01:51:31,964
- This is my prayer.
- What are you saying?

832
01:51:33,197 --> 01:51:36,336
Dear, I am sorry for my mistake.

833
01:51:36,512 --> 01:51:38,862
Enough, uncle.
Don't embarrass me anymore.

834
01:51:39,394 --> 01:51:40,588
Professor.

835
01:51:43,521 --> 01:51:44,521
Take this ticket.

836
01:51:45,100 --> 01:51:46,920
- When will the train come?
- At 3 o' clock.

837
01:51:47,479 --> 01:51:48,658
But how will you go?

838
01:51:48,818 --> 01:51:50,800
We have to fetch Rita
from the hospital today.

839
01:51:51,142 --> 01:51:53,851
Okay, but it is more
important for me to go.

840
01:51:54,113 --> 01:51:55,239
You are going out somewhere.

841
01:51:55,423 --> 01:51:57,845
Yes dear, regarding your work.

842
01:51:58,399 --> 01:52:01,269
It is property dispute.
The lawyer have telegrammed me.

843
01:52:01,460 --> 01:52:05,855
Rita is not well, professor.
Won't it do if Mr. Suraj goes?

844
01:52:06,670 --> 01:52:09,982
- It will but..
- No, problem. I will go.

845
01:52:10,545 --> 01:52:13,616
It is only a matter of one day.
Just to go and come.

846
01:52:13,859 --> 01:52:16,160
But I don't want to exert you.

847
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:18,343
Maybe you have some
important work here.

848
01:52:18,463 --> 01:52:21,069
What are you saying, uncle?
You look after Rita.

849
01:52:21,312 --> 01:52:22,832
I will go and prepare
for my departure.

850
01:52:28,305 --> 01:52:30,328
Rakesh, the work is done.

851
01:52:30,850 --> 01:52:34,800
Listen; be with him all the time.

852
01:52:35,422 --> 01:52:37,468
Don't leave him alone for a moment.

853
01:52:38,245 --> 01:52:42,239
And remember, it is your job to
keep him away from here.

854
01:52:43,598 --> 01:52:50,487
It is very important for Suraj's
life to stay away from Kiran tonight.

855
01:52:51,117 --> 01:52:55,323
Be rest assured, professor.
This thing won't happen again.

856
01:53:04,311 --> 01:53:06,695
- Mr. Rakesh. - Yes.
- How long is the journey?

857
01:53:06,946 --> 01:53:09,692
The journey has just started.
Are you bored?

858
01:53:10,913 --> 01:53:14,044
- If you want shall we play cards to pass the time?
- Do so.

859
01:53:14,260 --> 01:53:15,368
All right.

860
01:53:24,066 --> 01:53:29,324
'You are going.
Leaving me. What have I said?'

861
01:53:29,729 --> 01:53:31,106
'You have forgotten.'

862
01:53:34,124 --> 01:53:35,306
'Come back.'

863
01:53:35,426 --> 01:53:36,576
'Come back.'

864
01:53:36,696 --> 01:53:37,752
'Come back.'

865
01:54:36,537 --> 01:54:40,206
- Kiran!
- You were going, leaving me behind.

866
01:54:40,326 --> 01:54:41,765
No, Kiran, I have come back.

867
01:54:41,885 --> 01:54:43,429
But why did you go?

868
01:54:43,947 --> 01:54:47,903
I have told you that maybe
today is our last meeting.

869
01:54:48,728 --> 01:54:51,099
And you have tried to
go away from me today.

870
01:54:51,453 --> 01:54:54,292
Today we will belong to each other.

871
01:54:55,367 --> 01:54:57,766
I have decided to get married today.

872
01:55:01,330 --> 01:55:02,330
Kiran!

873
01:55:12,856 --> 01:55:18,216
Suraj, forget
what has happened till now?

874
01:55:18,725 --> 01:55:19,728
Kiran!

875
01:55:21,146 --> 01:55:22,916
We can't get married.

876
01:55:23,116 --> 01:55:27,904
- Kiran! Do you love me?
- I love you.

877
01:55:28,581 --> 01:55:30,479
I want to be yours forever.

878
01:55:32,413 --> 01:55:33,728
But I can't.

879
01:55:34,990 --> 01:55:38,747
What do you mean?
Were you acting with me till today?

880
01:55:39,380 --> 01:55:41,396
Were you playing with my emotions?

881
01:55:41,652 --> 01:55:48,285
No. No, Suraj, no.
I can't make you understand.

882
01:55:48,828 --> 01:55:50,187
You have to make me understand.

883
01:55:50,365 --> 01:55:53,649
I want to know which force on
earth can stop you from being mine.

884
01:55:53,930 --> 01:55:55,289
You want to know.

885
01:55:55,921 --> 01:55:57,003
Yes.

886
01:55:57,192 --> 01:55:58,521
Then come with me.

887
01:56:09,311 --> 01:56:10,895
Can you see these ruins?

888
01:56:12,941 --> 01:56:14,728
It used to be Chandrika Nagar.

889
01:56:15,214 --> 01:56:17,521
King Sindhu Vilas had established it.

890
01:56:26,098 --> 01:56:27,098
Come.

891
01:56:43,869 --> 01:56:45,420
This was the room
of the most prominent..

892
01:56:45,444 --> 01:56:48,196
And famous sculptor of that time.

893
01:56:49,937 --> 01:56:52,907
Which the king had
constructed especially..

894
01:56:53,122 --> 01:56:54,971
To make a statue of his queen.

895
01:57:01,134 --> 01:57:02,223
Can you see this statue?

896
01:57:07,824 --> 01:57:09,146
It is of that same queen.

897
01:57:09,650 --> 01:57:11,146
But only the body is hers.

898
01:57:12,057 --> 01:57:13,890
The face belongs to someone else.

899
01:57:23,436 --> 01:57:24,436
See that.

900
01:57:33,460 --> 01:57:34,872
See here.

901
01:57:48,182 --> 01:57:49,396
And that.

902
01:58:14,229 --> 01:58:17,563
And who knows how many
more statues that sculptor made.

903
01:58:19,770 --> 01:58:22,937
- But he couldn't make the queen's statue.
- Why?

904
01:58:23,437 --> 01:58:26,645
Because he was deeply in love..

905
01:58:27,680 --> 01:58:30,968
With one of the royal
dancers of Chandrika Nagar.

906
01:58:31,838 --> 01:58:36,123
So much that he lost
control over his hands.

907
01:58:37,521 --> 01:58:43,182
Unknowingly he used to sculpt the
face of his Kiranmai on every statue.

908
01:58:45,756 --> 01:58:46,812
Kiranmai?

909
01:58:50,525 --> 01:58:51,525
Yes.

910
01:58:53,918 --> 01:58:59,915
And when he couldn't
make the queen's statue..

911
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:03,999
After much endeavour then
king Chandra Vilas was very angry.

912
01:59:04,479 --> 01:59:09,126
And he decided that he
won't be able to make someone..

913
01:59:10,476 --> 01:59:13,607
Else's statue till
Kiranmai is alive.

914
01:59:14,288 --> 01:59:15,396
What happened then?

915
01:59:16,461 --> 01:59:18,781
The king had Kiranmai murdered.

916
01:59:19,553 --> 01:59:25,537
In this room. At this place.
2,000 years ago.

917
01:59:26,312 --> 01:59:27,940
How do you know all this?

918
01:59:31,144 --> 01:59:32,441
I am Kiranmai.

919
01:59:35,556 --> 01:59:39,189
Kiranmai's spirit
who was estranged from..

920
01:59:39,309 --> 01:59:44,608
Surya Prakash
and is searching for him.

921
01:59:45,655 --> 01:59:46,901
Surya Prakash?

922
01:59:47,141 --> 01:59:51,098
It was your name.
You still didn't understand.

923
01:59:52,019 --> 01:59:55,771
After many years
Surya Prakash and Kiranmai..

924
01:59:56,071 --> 01:59:58,485
Have met as Suraj and Kiran.

925
02:00:00,779 --> 02:00:03,281
- This is a co-incidence.
- It is reality.

926
02:00:05,196 --> 02:00:07,023
You have forgotten it.

927
02:00:07,812 --> 02:00:10,981
You became mad
with the shock of my death..

928
02:00:11,260 --> 02:00:13,634
And went away God knows where.

929
02:00:15,039 --> 02:00:18,851
As soon as you
left the volcano erupted

930
02:00:21,020 --> 02:00:27,318
And Chandrika Nagar was
forever buried under that lava.

931
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:30,835
You don't remember anything.

932
02:00:40,210 --> 02:00:44,042
Kiran, can all these be true?

933
02:00:44,312 --> 02:00:49,110
Yes and the proof is that
we can't even become united..

934
02:00:49,379 --> 02:00:52,903
Even meeting after so many eras.

935
02:00:53,643 --> 02:00:55,490
I cannot become yours.

936
02:00:58,443 --> 02:00:59,443
Why?

937
02:01:01,235 --> 02:01:05,868
I am a spirit. And your
body is the block to our union.

938
02:01:11,186 --> 02:01:13,681
And if my body is longer there?

939
02:01:14,354 --> 02:01:18,922
We will become one. Forever.

940
02:01:21,372 --> 02:01:24,388
Then I will do away
with this block forever.

941
02:01:25,110 --> 02:01:26,986
If I can't get you by staying alive..

942
02:01:27,106 --> 02:01:28,546
Then there is no meaning to life.

943
02:01:28,728 --> 02:01:32,706
Then today.
Tonight is the 14th moon night.

944
02:01:33,764 --> 02:01:35,443
This night won't come again, Suraj.

945
02:01:35,563 --> 02:01:36,957
This night won't come again.

946
02:01:37,923 --> 02:01:39,122
If we are not able
to meet tonight then..

947
02:01:39,146 --> 02:01:42,160
Stop it.
I am ready to die this moment.

948
02:01:44,857 --> 02:01:45,997
Take him away.

949
02:01:50,710 --> 02:01:54,159
You would have taken an
innocent man's life if I was late.

950
02:01:55,300 --> 02:01:57,956
I know very well, who you are.

951
02:01:58,076 --> 02:02:00,708
A rambling spirit.

952
02:02:01,075 --> 02:02:05,349
The one who needs the sacrifice
of a life to free itself.

953
02:02:05,518 --> 02:02:10,489
But remember,
it will never happen till I am alive.

954
02:02:10,609 --> 02:02:13,890
You will never be
successful in your motives.

955
02:02:14,010 --> 02:02:18,643
You will be finished,
but you won't be able to hurt Suraj.

956
02:02:19,187 --> 02:02:21,020
You won't be able to hurt him.

957
02:02:25,192 --> 02:02:30,070
Doctor, he shouldn't gain
consciousness at no condition tonight.

958
02:02:32,124 --> 02:02:33,263
Be rest assured.

959
02:02:33,863 --> 02:02:36,271
His sleep cannot be
broken before morning.

960
02:02:36,956 --> 02:02:40,004
The effect of the
injection remains for 12 hours.

961
02:02:40,124 --> 02:02:42,880
- Thank you, doctor. Thank you.
- Come, doctor.

962
02:03:55,459 --> 02:04:03,459
"The world had prevented
our union every time."

963
02:04:10,695 --> 02:04:15,615
"When will you wake up
from your sleep?"

964
02:04:15,790 --> 02:04:21,208
"When will this dream break?"

965
02:04:25,791 --> 02:04:33,791
"The world had prevented
our union every time."

966
02:04:36,014 --> 02:04:40,885
"When will you wake up
from your sleep?"

967
02:04:41,085 --> 02:04:45,969
"When will this dream break?"

968
02:04:46,089 --> 02:04:54,089
"If you don't wake up,
then destruction will wake up."

969
02:04:56,618 --> 02:05:04,618
"My heart broke,
but you didn't hear it."

970
02:05:06,807 --> 02:05:10,754
"But you didn't hear it."

971
02:05:16,810 --> 02:05:21,681
"But you didn't hear it."

972
02:05:27,009 --> 02:05:33,379
"But you didn't hear it."

973
02:05:58,509 --> 02:06:00,361
Kiran!

974
02:06:34,014 --> 02:06:35,670
You are so late.

975
02:06:36,003 --> 02:06:38,941
I was frightened that you won't come.

976
02:06:39,987 --> 02:06:42,060
No power could have stopped me today.

977
02:06:43,578 --> 02:06:44,859
See there.

978
02:06:50,389 --> 02:06:55,387
It is time. Are you ready?

979
02:06:56,223 --> 02:06:57,306
Yes.

980
02:06:58,422 --> 02:06:59,841
Then come with me.

981
02:07:13,532 --> 02:07:17,879
This is the place where
we to will be united for ever.

982
02:07:18,782 --> 02:07:22,849
This is time for which we
were waiting since 2,000 years.

983
02:07:26,648 --> 02:07:27,648
Don't think.

984
02:07:27,760 --> 02:07:28,993
Don't wait, Suraj.

985
02:07:29,345 --> 02:07:33,131
Unite with me by
finishing your body for ever.

986
02:07:54,696 --> 02:07:55,972
No!

987
02:07:56,922 --> 02:08:04,775
No, Suraj, no! I won't let you die.
I can't commit this crime.

988
02:08:06,056 --> 02:08:07,056
What is the matter?

989
02:08:07,390 --> 02:08:10,057
I am no soul or spirit.

990
02:08:10,605 --> 02:08:14,986
Whatever I have told you was a lie.
Everything was false.

991
02:08:16,371 --> 02:08:20,276
I am an ordinary girl.
I am an unlucky girl.

992
02:08:20,453 --> 02:08:22,654
Kiran! What are you saying?

993
02:08:23,281 --> 02:08:26,765
- Run away from here.
- Why? - Your life is in danger.

994
02:08:26,932 --> 02:08:29,802
- What?
- Don't ask questions. Hurry.

995
02:08:49,306 --> 02:08:50,390
Rakesh!

996
02:08:53,687 --> 02:08:58,380
Foolish girl, you have lost
wealth and now even your life.

997
02:08:59,567 --> 02:09:02,141
No, sir. I am still alive.

998
02:09:03,199 --> 02:09:06,294
Baba, the police are
still searching for you.

999
02:09:07,004 --> 02:09:08,444
You can be hanged if I say anything.

1000
02:09:08,699 --> 02:09:10,768
With this threatening
you have forced me..

1001
02:09:10,888 --> 02:09:13,640
And my daughter
to dance to your tunes.

1002
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:15,464
I sheltered you.
Saved you from the police.

1003
02:09:15,765 --> 02:09:17,997
And today you are
just alive because of me.

1004
02:09:18,594 --> 02:09:23,101
No, sir. I am alive only
for my daughter's sake.

1005
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:28,905
My poverty and daughter
had forced me to commit crimes.

1006
02:09:29,412 --> 02:09:32,050
And because of that I
have even ran away from jail.

1007
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:36,422
But today when her
life is in danger..

1008
02:09:36,542 --> 02:09:40,186
- Then I can even risk my life.
- You don't know.

1009
02:09:40,306 --> 02:09:45,386
- Give me this pistol.
- What? - Hurry. Give.

1010
02:09:59,433 --> 02:10:00,573
Father!

1011
02:11:42,118 --> 02:11:43,876
Throw him.

1012
02:13:46,066 --> 02:13:50,444
- Rakesh.
- He was a very cunning and dangerous man.

1013
02:13:51,053 --> 02:13:53,198
Inspector,
why did he want to kill me?

1014
02:13:53,366 --> 02:13:54,885
Because of your wealth.

1015
02:13:55,005 --> 02:13:56,965
Which according to
your father's veil..

1016
02:13:57,261 --> 02:13:59,878
Would go to the
professor's daughter if you die.

1017
02:14:00,320 --> 02:14:02,085
But how is Rakesh
connected with that?

1018
02:14:02,561 --> 02:14:04,633
Rakesh was connected
to your daughter.

1019
02:14:04,753 --> 02:14:06,324
Inspector!

1020
02:14:07,012 --> 02:14:12,461
Even your daughter was with
Rakesh in the plot to kill Suraj

1021
02:14:12,863 --> 02:14:14,512
This is impossible, inspector.

1022
02:14:16,508 --> 02:14:17,753
Ask her.

1023
02:14:22,656 --> 02:14:24,736
Rita. Rita.

1024
02:14:25,321 --> 02:14:28,544
Rita, what is all this?
What is the inspector saying?

1025
02:14:28,894 --> 02:14:34,144
What is he saying? You and Rakesh..

1026
02:14:34,821 --> 02:14:38,550
How is that possible?
This is wrong. Say that it is false.

1027
02:14:38,785 --> 02:14:42,714
It is impossible.
Say that you can never do this.

1028
02:14:43,088 --> 02:14:44,544
I am saying, tell these..

1029
02:14:52,702 --> 02:14:56,639
This is true.

1030
02:14:58,444 --> 02:15:02,969
Speak, why don't you speak?
Answer me.

1031
02:15:03,237 --> 02:15:05,147
Ask me the answer.

1032
02:15:10,102 --> 02:15:13,767
The day you found that
skeleton and that statue..

1033
02:15:14,056 --> 02:15:18,289
That very day Rakesh
hatched a plan to kill Suraj.

1034
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:20,965
And that very day the Kiranmai..

1035
02:15:21,085 --> 02:15:24,218
And her 2,000 years
old story was born.

1036
02:15:26,908 --> 02:15:32,668
Rakesh forced this
innocent girl to be Kiranmai.

1037
02:15:34,940 --> 02:15:40,946
Your daughter arranged for
the ancient dresses and jewellery.

1038
02:15:41,250 --> 02:15:46,796
Your daughter even fired false
bullets in front of you on Kiranmai.

1039
02:15:46,951 --> 02:15:50,374
And made you believe
that she is a spirit.

1040
02:15:50,560 --> 02:15:51,619
But why?

1041
02:15:51,739 --> 02:15:54,038
Because they would have never got..

1042
02:15:54,208 --> 02:15:56,999
Suraj's wealth
without your permission.

1043
02:15:59,470 --> 02:16:02,308
I suspected Rakesh the very moment..

1044
02:16:02,428 --> 02:16:07,653
When he took Suraj and Kiran's
photos and Kiran was not visible.

1045
02:16:10,518 --> 02:16:11,784
Do you recognise him?

1046
02:16:15,995 --> 02:16:16,995
Yes.

1047
02:16:17,088 --> 02:16:22,728
He had lied that no horse cart
had left the tunnel and you returned.

1048
02:16:22,953 --> 02:16:24,773
If you had gone a little
further you would have found..

1049
02:16:24,797 --> 02:16:26,880
The horse cart waiting among rocks.

1050
02:16:28,522 --> 02:16:32,529
And this is the man whom
you have met in the mansion.

1051
02:16:34,425 --> 02:16:37,794
And this is the doctor
who had injected Suraj.

1052
02:16:39,939 --> 02:16:43,461
All these are Rakesh's men.
All are criminals.

1053
02:16:44,179 --> 02:16:45,377
Take them away.

1054
02:17:11,366 --> 02:17:12,503
Professor.

1055
02:17:19,031 --> 02:17:23,724
Professor,
I am very sorry for your daughter.

1056
02:17:29,490 --> 02:17:35,297
Inspector,
the criminal should be punished.

1057
02:17:46,419 --> 02:17:47,419
Kiran.

1058
02:17:57,039 --> 02:17:58,343
What is this?

1059
02:18:02,188 --> 02:18:06,328
A drama is over. My work is over.

1060
02:18:07,504 --> 02:18:10,968
I had seen a beautiful
dream that is over too.

1061
02:18:14,248 --> 02:18:15,503
That is not over.

1062
02:18:17,477 --> 02:18:19,064
It will become true now.

1063
02:18:23,889 --> 02:18:28,131
No, Suraj.
I am not worthy of your love.

1064
02:18:28,352 --> 02:18:29,352
Kiran!

1065
02:18:30,236 --> 02:18:38,236
"My love is such that
even after I die..

1066
02:18:42,568 --> 02:18:49,751
I won't allow you to
get out from my arms."

1067
02:18:49,871 --> 02:18:53,543
"Even if I get heaven."

1068
02:18:53,664 --> 02:19:01,664
"I will ask God you
instead of heaven."

1069
02:19:04,137 --> 02:19:07,656
"My love is such.."
