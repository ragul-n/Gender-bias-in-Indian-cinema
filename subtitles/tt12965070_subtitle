00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:11,257
Motherfuckers,

3
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,591
if you say anything to anyone.

4
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,343
Next time I will shoot you in the ass.

5
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,597
Never come looking for us.

6
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,927
Take good care of yourself.

7
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,013
God bless you my son.

8
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:04,262
Hello?

9
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,973
Hey Vilom, how are you my friend?

10
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:07,307
Where are you?

11
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,100
here only...

12
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:09,851
How are you?

13
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:10,978
I am good.

14
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:12,562
And how come you're
remembering me today?

15
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:14,439
Why wouldn't I remember you my friend?

16
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:16,776
By the way I have called you

17
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,194
to invite you to my
wedding reception.

18
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,361
You have to come.

19
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:20,362
No excuses.

20
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:21,529
Really...

21
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,199
You're getting married?

22
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:23,907
Yes.

23
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,871
Anyway, tomorrow evening at 7:30PM.

24
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,122
Do not forget.

25
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,916
Sure. Definitely...

26
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:34,668
Then, I will see you tomorrow.

27
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:35,543
Bye!

28
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,128
Bye!

29
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,697
Can I have two cigarettes?

30
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,438
You guys have been watching
cricket all morning.

31
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:02,316
Please play some music.

32
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,579
Hi guys, My name is Vilom
and you are watching Sh...

33
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,748
Hi guys, My name is Vilom and
you are watching Shut Up Vilom

34
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,915
and today I am going to review...

35
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,976
Hi guys, My name is Vilom and
you are watching Shut Up Vilom

36
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:23,272
And today I am going to review
a film, "Love Aaj Kal"

37
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,106
starring Saif Ali Khan.

38
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:30,047
Where is my lord?

39
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:34,009
I do remember where I should be,
and there I am.

40
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,553
Shh...

41
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,015
Please leave us alone.

42
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,519
Oh! My Romeo.

43
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,479
Romeo. What is here? Poison.

44
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,942
Has this poison killed you?

45
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:57,198
I will kiss your lips.

46
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,076
Happily some poison yet do hang on them.

47
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,329
We will be together again.

48
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,210
Oh! Romeo.

49
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:12,548
Your lips are warm.

50
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,545
Yes sir... what would you
like to have done?

51
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,630
The usual.

52
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:25,216
Growing your hair?

53
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:26,469
Trying my best.

54
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:17,228
It's your turn sir.

55
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,396
Please come.

56
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:22,316
Here.

57
00:16:26,946 --> 00:16:27,446
Yes sir?

58
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:28,698
What would you like me to do sir?

59
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:11,990
But...

60
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:13,701
But what happened sir?

61
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:20,415
Here.

62
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,402
Can I have a cigarette?

63
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:48,985
Which one?

64
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:50,820
Give me anyone, just do it fast.

65
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:10,725
I don't want it.

66
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:14,686
You smoke a lot of cigarettes these days.

67
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,355
Don't you think it is harmful?

68
00:23:34,707 --> 00:23:36,459
Wow... what a nice joke.

69
00:23:38,961 --> 00:23:41,255
People have created records
in quitting smoking.

70
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:46,217
And as someone once said...

71
00:23:47,053 --> 00:23:51,390
Life is of those on whose death
the world regrets Ghalib;

72
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:55,644
as every person takes birth
in this world to die someday!

73
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:57,812
Wow... you have a poet in you.

74
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:00,398
Is there any other talent
you want to show me?

75
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:05,779
You know what, I come here very often...

76
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:16,581
Do you see this open hand?

77
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:22,128
You can also see a free bird in it.

78
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:26,174
Who is flying freely all above
the these mountains and clouds.

79
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,596
I also want be like a free bird.

80
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:33,348
I want to fly really high.

81
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,016
Le Corbusier constructed this .

82
00:24:36,102 --> 00:24:37,603
Le Corbusier was a French artist.

83
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:38,561
And I really like them...

84
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:41,065
Especially their artists.

85
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:45,194
Le Corbusier wanted that people come here

86
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:47,613
and speak from their heart.

87
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:49,114
They talk about issues.

88
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:53,828
Well, people don't come here anymore.

89
00:24:55,413 --> 00:24:56,830
But I still come here.

90
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:00,710
And you have also come today.

91
00:29:41,323 --> 00:29:42,908
Seems like your work is
not good these days?

92
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,910
No... No all is OK.

93
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:48,038
Just trying to do something new.

94
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:50,457
Didn't I tell you about my
social experiment project?

95
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:51,625
No.

96
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:52,917
You didn't tell me anything.

97
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,670
Really?

98
00:29:55,046 --> 00:29:55,962
Anyway...

99
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:57,590
Soon you will know.

100
00:29:57,631 --> 00:30:00,593
Well, it has been like a
dream for a long time.

101
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:29,954
Anyhow

102
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:31,582
It changes nothing.

103
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,000
Our families,

104
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:34,125
our society...

105
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:35,502
our country

106
00:30:35,795 --> 00:30:37,462
will never accept us.

107
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,787
How are you?

108
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:48,094
One minute sir.

109
00:33:07,488 --> 00:33:10,408
Have you seen the TV?

110
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,785
What happened? Are you OK?

111
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:15,621
Oh yes! But they are talking about
criminalization of same sex relationships.

112
00:33:16,122 --> 00:33:18,124
Oh! OK... understood.

113
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:19,750
You don't worry, OK?

114
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:21,418
I am little busy right now.

115
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,795
But listen to me...

116
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:24,672
Listening...

117
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:27,048
let's meet after work.

118
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:28,842
Now disconnecting the call

119
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:30,510
OK? Bye!

120
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:32,680
Listen to me.... Hello?

121
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:01,041
Are you sure, you want to do it?

122
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:06,672
Yes!

123
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:10,134
I mean it is difficult to perform
this in front of the camera...

124
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:11,427
But...

125
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:18,099
So finally after so many efforts
we are working together.

126
00:34:20,186 --> 00:34:21,812
But you have to keep
this thing in mind...

127
00:34:22,021 --> 00:34:25,316
That you have to keep
your facial expressions

128
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:27,568
and emotions in control.

129
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:37,452
I will suggest you some...

130
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:40,581
plays, and...

131
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:45,585
And read which ever you like.

132
00:34:45,795 --> 00:34:50,132
Also do some fake practice if possible.

133
00:35:38,431 --> 00:35:40,432
How are you my son?

134
00:35:41,684 --> 00:35:42,518
I am doing fine mother.

135
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:44,561
Why don't you call me?

136
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:48,023
Or at least pick our
calls when we call you.

137
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:49,108
Are you alright?

138
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,027
Yes mother!
I am absolutely fine here.

139
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,362
I am really busy in this salon job,

140
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:55,280
I really could not find time to call anyone.

141
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:56,906
And I am absolutely fine,

142
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:58,242
don't worry about me. OK?

143
00:35:58,701 --> 00:35:59,827
I am really fine.

144
00:35:59,869 --> 00:36:02,246
Son, at least visit us sometimes.

145
00:36:02,288 --> 00:36:03,789
Since you have gone to Chandigarh

146
00:36:03,873 --> 00:36:06,000
all our family and friends ask about you...

147
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,585
They all praise you.

148
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:10,004
Some of them really push
me to get you married.

149
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:11,922
But it is you only who does
not answer clearly.

150
00:36:11,963 --> 00:36:14,967
If you will get married, our
responsibilities will be over.

151
00:36:15,009 --> 00:36:17,052
Al least I will have some
help in daily chores.

152
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:18,429
Mother, you have started
this topic again.

153
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:20,139
Again same old discussion.

154
00:36:20,181 --> 00:36:21,264
I have told you many times,

155
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:22,724
I don't want to get married.

156
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:24,393
Son, this is the perfect age to get married.

157
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:27,228
If you get married then we will only be able
to think about your younger sister.

158
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:28,522
How long should we we wait for you?

159
00:36:28,563 --> 00:36:32,275
Please don't force me to get married.

160
00:36:32,902 --> 00:36:34,862
Just because of this nonsense
talk I moved to Chandigarh.

161
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,822
Now, you started the same
thing again to irritate me.

162
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:40,326
I will talk to you later.

163
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:45,413
What happened?

164
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:46,916
All well?

165
00:37:43,264 --> 00:37:44,222
And curd?

166
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:48,101
Small one.

167
00:40:11,786 --> 00:40:14,122
How was your day in salon?

168
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,675
You don't even call me.

169
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:52,077
At least tell me something.

170
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:05,757
Do you know that I get calls
everyday from my mother?

171
00:41:06,257 --> 00:41:07,634
She only asks just one question...

172
00:41:07,677 --> 00:41:10,512
when would you get married my son?

173
00:41:12,056 --> 00:41:14,141
I really don't understand
what are we doing?

174
00:41:14,684 --> 00:41:16,018
What am I doing?

175
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:19,521
How do I answer family?

176
00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:24,652
That I am in love with a man...

177
00:41:31,074 --> 00:41:32,909
And who does not even care about me.

178
00:41:33,077 --> 00:41:35,413
Who does not even know
that how am I feeling?

179
00:41:37,914 --> 00:41:39,000
Who is that girl?

180
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:46,172
So?

181
00:41:57,434 --> 00:41:58,768
Don't you think...

182
00:41:59,228 --> 00:42:01,230
that you're taking your experiment...

183
00:42:01,313 --> 00:42:03,106
too seriously?

184
00:42:05,233 --> 00:42:07,235
You are just being filthy,
nothing else.

185
00:42:08,903 --> 00:42:10,655
What do you mean?

186
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:26,297
What do you call it?

187
00:42:26,463 --> 00:42:27,922
Experiments or porn?

188
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:30,300
Or cheap thrill to get some
internet fame?

189
00:42:33,971 --> 00:42:35,972
Is the mirror of the society.

190
00:42:38,266 --> 00:42:40,894
And it tries to not get affected
by anything.

191
00:42:43,438 --> 00:42:45,023
So, now tell me...

192
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:50,570
How does sex make my artistic
message a cheap thrill?

193
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,846
Lion is coming in...

194
00:43:57,512 --> 00:43:59,347
Lion is coming in...

195
00:43:59,431 --> 00:44:00,890
Lion is coming in...

196
00:44:00,932 --> 00:44:02,434
Lion is coming in...

197
00:44:08,858 --> 00:44:09,984
Nothing happened, just relax.

198
00:44:10,317 --> 00:44:11,235
Show me...

199
00:44:11,402 --> 00:44:12,610
At least show me.

200
00:44:12,652 --> 00:44:13,778
must be hurting...

201
00:44:15,697 --> 00:44:16,614
Don't worry.

202
00:44:29,085 --> 00:44:33,256
Lion is coming in...

203
00:44:42,557 --> 00:44:47,021
They all look so beautiful.

204
00:44:48,188 --> 00:44:49,856
This earth...

205
00:44:51,317 --> 00:44:53,027
This river...

206
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,862
This waterfall.

207
00:44:56,322 --> 00:44:56,989
And?

208
00:44:57,239 --> 00:44:57,907
And?

209
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:01,369
Goat?

210
00:45:01,409 --> 00:45:03,411
And you.

211
00:45:09,001 --> 00:45:10,836
You keep me squeezing,

212
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:13,547
just like goat's udder.

213
00:45:28,978 --> 00:45:31,564
She died by her own hand.

214
00:45:32,023 --> 00:45:34,943
The worst of what was done you cannot know.

215
00:45:34,985 --> 00:45:37,405
You did not see the sight.

216
00:45:38,489 --> 00:45:40,740
Yet in so far as I remember it,

217
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:43,744
you’ll hear the end of
our unlucky queen.

218
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:47,288
When she came raging
into the house,

219
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:52,585
she was tearing her hair
with both hands.

220
00:45:53,253 --> 00:45:55,880
she went straight to
her marriage bed,

221
00:45:56,215 --> 00:45:58,217
and closed the door.

222
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:02,429
and started crying upon
Laius long dead-

223
00:46:02,722 --> 00:46:04,640
Do you remember, Laius,

224
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:07,350
that night long past which
bred a child for us...

225
00:46:10,186 --> 00:46:12,981
to send you to death

226
00:46:13,398 --> 00:46:16,818
and leave a mother making
children with her son?

227
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:22,532
She cursed the bed in which she
brought children by her own child.

228
00:46:25,244 --> 00:46:28,079
The infamous double bond.

229
00:46:30,623 --> 00:46:32,876
She brought forth husband
by her husband,

230
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:35,503
children by her own child,

231
00:46:35,588 --> 00:46:41,427
How after that she died I do not know.

232
00:46:43,137 --> 00:46:46,222
King burst upon us shouting

233
00:46:48,976 --> 00:46:50,978
and we looked to him

234
00:46:51,644 --> 00:46:53,688
Shouting at us always:

235
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:55,733
Give me a sword, I say,

236
00:46:58,652 --> 00:47:00,653
Give me a sword...

237
00:47:02,072 --> 00:47:04,074
to find this wife no wife,

238
00:47:04,282 --> 00:47:06,284
this mother’s womb this
field of double sowing

239
00:47:07,952 --> 00:47:10,706
whence I sprang

240
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:15,001
and where I sowed my children!

241
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,922
He raved,

242
00:47:19,255 --> 00:47:21,257
He bellowed terribly

243
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:25,304
as if led by some invisible guide.

244
00:47:29,391 --> 00:47:31,851
Nobody knew anything,

245
00:47:31,893 --> 00:47:35,939
that what has happened
to the queen?

246
00:47:40,443 --> 00:47:44,197
He rushed on the two doors,

247
00:47:44,447 --> 00:47:48,702
— wrenching the hollow bolts
out of their sockets,

248
00:47:48,994 --> 00:47:53,332
There, there, we saw his wife hanging,

249
00:47:53,373 --> 00:47:55,166
the twisted rope around her neck.

250
00:47:55,291 --> 00:47:57,293
and the king...

251
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:26,656
I could not complete
the paragraph.

252
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:29,660
It's OK.

253
00:48:47,552 --> 00:48:48,971
Cut!

254
00:49:18,668 --> 00:49:20,251
Well, I feel like

255
00:49:20,293 --> 00:49:22,754
I owe you a coffee.

256
00:49:34,141 --> 00:49:35,309
Shall we?

257
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:49,239
I meant coffee,

258
00:49:49,364 --> 00:49:51,783
not a cappuccino.

259
00:49:56,706 --> 00:49:57,957
Really?

260
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:09,969
Meaning?

261
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:20,980
Meaning?

262
00:50:24,608 --> 00:50:26,235
You have a boyfriend, meaning...

263
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,962
I am at my salon.
Anything important?

264
00:51:38,891 --> 00:51:41,059
Listen, right now I am really busy

265
00:51:42,018 --> 00:51:44,771
Let's meet in the evening?

266
00:53:16,489 --> 00:53:17,572
Let's go.

267
00:53:19,992 --> 00:53:22,745
What else would you do.

268
00:53:22,786 --> 00:53:24,288
Oh! I will quit soon.

269
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:26,331
Very soon.

270
00:53:28,376 --> 00:53:30,378
I will take you to a better place.

271
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,758
It's open.

272
00:53:36,257 --> 00:53:37,509
Let's see.

273
00:53:43,766 --> 00:53:44,724
Here.

274
00:54:11,793 --> 00:54:14,045
They don't have anything
good in veg.

275
00:54:17,465 --> 00:54:19,467
You please order something interesting.

276
00:54:19,969 --> 00:54:21,262
But something good.

277
00:54:24,056 --> 00:54:25,307
OK.

278
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,643
Let me see.

279
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:36,609
Veg?

280
00:54:36,818 --> 00:54:38,153
Yes veg.

281
00:54:38,237 --> 00:54:38,820
What?

282
00:54:38,862 --> 00:54:40,614
Mhmm... Veg.

283
00:54:42,782 --> 00:54:44,784
Non-veg?

284
00:55:11,228 --> 00:55:13,230
What happened?

285
00:55:35,503 --> 00:55:37,004
Shall we go some other place?

286
00:55:37,713 --> 00:55:39,715
Hmm...

287
00:56:13,164 --> 00:56:14,166
Are you still feeling cold?

288
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:15,084
No.

289
00:56:18,545 --> 00:56:19,838
Look there.

290
00:56:37,106 --> 00:56:37,606
Deepak,

291
00:56:37,773 --> 00:56:38,024
Hmm?

292
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:38,858
Call them.

293
00:56:40,192 --> 00:56:40,693
Hey...

294
00:56:42,445 --> 00:56:43,112
Go, call them.

295
00:56:45,405 --> 00:56:45,822
Hey!

296
00:56:47,657 --> 00:56:48,534
Who are you?

297
00:56:49,702 --> 00:56:51,037
What are you doing here so late?

298
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:52,663
We are just going home, sir!

299
00:56:52,871 --> 00:56:53,830
Bring them here.

300
00:56:53,914 --> 00:56:55,082
Move, move!

301
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:57,083
Move on.

302
00:56:57,626 --> 00:56:58,836
Come, come over here.

303
00:56:59,295 --> 00:57:00,755
Yes, keep going.

304
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:02,380
Sir, what happened?

305
00:57:02,422 --> 00:57:03,381
Stand here.

306
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:04,174
We are just...

307
00:57:04,467 --> 00:57:05,384
Stand here.

308
00:57:05,885 --> 00:57:07,011
Come forward.

309
00:57:07,969 --> 00:57:08,386
You too.

310
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:09,805
Are you drunk?

311
00:57:10,764 --> 00:57:11,264
What?

312
00:57:11,306 --> 00:57:11,556
No.

313
00:57:11,766 --> 00:57:12,391
What?

314
00:57:13,224 --> 00:57:14,726
I had only one beer.

315
00:57:14,893 --> 00:57:16,269
Just one beer...
you motherfucker.

316
00:57:16,936 --> 00:57:17,813
Sir...

317
00:57:17,855 --> 00:57:18,731
Motherfuckers.

318
00:57:18,813 --> 00:57:19,565
Sir... sir.

319
00:57:19,606 --> 00:57:20,690
I will teach you a lesson.

320
00:57:24,445 --> 00:57:26,530
Sir... sir we are just going home.

321
00:57:26,572 --> 00:57:27,615
Sir we have done nothing.

322
00:57:27,655 --> 00:57:29,909
Damn motherfuckers.
You both were kissing there.

323
00:57:29,949 --> 00:57:30,742
Damn faggot.

324
00:57:30,784 --> 00:57:31,284
Sir... sir.

325
00:57:34,914 --> 00:57:36,332
You really have that itching?

326
00:57:36,873 --> 00:57:38,333
Don't worry I will treat your itching.

327
00:57:38,626 --> 00:57:40,878
Put these faggots in the car.

328
00:57:41,545 --> 00:57:42,296
Our jeep?

329
00:57:42,588 --> 00:57:44,173
Are you crazy?
Put them in our personal car.

330
00:57:46,217 --> 00:57:48,052
Sir, please leave us.

331
00:57:48,094 --> 00:57:48,969
Keep moving.

332
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:50,429
We did not do anything.

333
00:57:50,471 --> 00:57:52,431
Sir, please.

334
00:57:52,472 --> 00:57:53,264
Move...

335
00:58:24,422 --> 00:58:25,673
Don't make noise.

336
00:58:25,715 --> 00:58:26,798
Don't move too much.

337
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:31,053
Who plays girl in both of
them Saini Sahib?

338
00:58:31,094 --> 00:58:32,012
I guess,

339
00:58:32,137 --> 00:58:33,639
whoever is more fairer must
be playing the girl's part.

340
00:58:33,972 --> 00:58:35,391
Quickly, call Jassi.

341
00:58:35,516 --> 00:58:35,932
Jassi?

342
00:58:36,809 --> 00:58:37,727
Yes, Jassi.

343
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:46,943
Hello, Jassi...

344
00:58:48,862 --> 00:58:50,280
Where are you?

345
00:58:51,824 --> 00:58:53,451
Ok. Just do one thing.

346
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:54,827
bring all the stuff.

347
00:58:55,036 --> 00:58:56,787
Quickly... reach with stuff.

348
00:58:56,996 --> 00:58:58,998
Yes... I will be there in 5 minutes.

349
00:58:59,539 --> 00:59:00,291
Quickly...

350
00:59:00,373 --> 00:59:00,957
OK.

351
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:01,916
Hold it.

352
00:59:11,385 --> 00:59:13,387
You both kiss each other?

353
00:59:14,722 --> 00:59:16,474
Don't you have any shame?

354
00:59:17,224 --> 00:59:19,226
How do you fuck each other?

355
00:59:24,731 --> 00:59:25,858
What are you looking at?

356
00:59:28,568 --> 00:59:30,570
Stop looking at me faggot.

357
00:59:30,945 --> 00:59:32,280
You really fucking with me?

358
00:59:33,532 --> 00:59:34,283
What?

359
00:59:34,617 --> 00:59:35,534
You really want it?

360
00:59:37,161 --> 00:59:37,952
Damn motherfucker...

361
00:59:37,994 --> 00:59:39,371
Don't fuck with me or you really
going to get hurt badly.

362
00:59:40,081 --> 00:59:42,083
Sit quietly.

363
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:44,250
Motherfucker.

364
00:59:56,389 --> 00:59:58,015
Want to burn my moustache?

365
01:00:05,106 --> 01:00:05,981
Take them out from the car.

366
01:00:06,023 --> 01:00:06,981
Quickly!

367
01:00:11,612 --> 01:00:13,280
Come out quickly.

368
01:00:15,157 --> 01:00:16,242
Please leave us sir.

369
01:00:16,282 --> 01:00:17,284
Keep moving.

370
01:00:17,451 --> 01:00:18,536
Shut up!

371
01:00:21,664 --> 01:00:23,457
Stand up, stand up.

372
01:00:27,545 --> 01:00:29,547
Motherfuckers.

373
01:00:30,505 --> 01:00:31,798
How are you Jaspal?

374
01:00:34,135 --> 01:00:35,636
They are running away.

375
01:00:38,472 --> 01:00:40,474
Hold them tight, damn motherfucker.

376
01:00:41,474 --> 01:00:43,435
Motherfuckers.

377
01:00:43,476 --> 01:00:45,478
Trying to run away...

378
01:00:48,148 --> 01:00:49,065
Stand up.

379
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:50,276
Stand up.

380
01:00:50,317 --> 01:00:52,277
Stand up, get inside.

381
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:53,737
You people have some strong itching.

382
01:00:53,987 --> 01:00:55,447
I will treat you properly today.

383
01:00:56,407 --> 01:00:58,409
Get inside.

384
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:02,245
Get inside, move your ass inside.

385
01:01:04,373 --> 01:01:05,708
Keep bashing them.

386
01:01:14,632 --> 01:01:16,051
Jassi, bring my peg.

387
01:01:17,844 --> 01:01:19,596
Make him stand.

388
01:01:20,847 --> 01:01:22,099
Get up. I said get up.

389
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:24,643
Get up.

390
01:01:26,019 --> 01:01:26,936
Along the wall.

391
01:01:26,978 --> 01:01:28,355
Where is my peg?

392
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,068
Get up.

393
01:01:35,028 --> 01:01:36,197
Jassi, come here.

394
01:01:36,237 --> 01:01:37,530
Please leave us sir.

395
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:39,074
Get up, make him stand.

396
01:01:39,407 --> 01:01:40,241
I said stand up.

397
01:01:40,326 --> 01:01:41,494
Bash him them.

398
01:01:43,871 --> 01:01:44,663
Motherfucker.

399
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:49,876
Damn dogs.

400
01:01:51,586 --> 01:01:52,338
Listen...

401
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,090
Take off their clothes.

402
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:55,508
Take off their clothes.

403
01:01:56,842 --> 01:01:58,094
Stand straight.

404
01:01:58,552 --> 01:01:59,970
Take off your clothes.

405
01:02:00,054 --> 01:02:00,971
I did not do anything.

406
01:02:01,097 --> 01:02:02,014
Why did not you realize
this before?

407
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:04,015
Damn faggot.

408
01:02:05,226 --> 01:02:06,143
Stand properly,

409
01:02:07,436 --> 01:02:08,269
hands up.

410
01:02:09,771 --> 01:02:10,855
Hands up.

411
01:02:13,858 --> 01:02:15,819
Sir... we didn't do anything.

412
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:17,862
Please leave us sir.

413
01:02:17,905 --> 01:02:18,823
Stand straight motherfucker.

414
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:19,948
Stand up motherfucker.

415
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:21,157
Don't irritate me you faggot.

416
01:02:23,577 --> 01:02:25,204
Sir... I did nothing.

417
01:02:25,246 --> 01:02:26,539
Stay away, motherfucker.

418
01:02:29,083 --> 01:02:30,001
No...

419
01:02:31,043 --> 01:02:31,876
Give it to me.

420
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:34,380
Stand up.

421
01:02:34,422 --> 01:02:36,423
No sir, please.

422
01:02:36,673 --> 01:02:39,719
Take off this.

423
01:02:43,764 --> 01:02:44,557
Motherfucker.

424
01:02:44,889 --> 01:02:46,141
Make him stand.

425
01:02:47,393 --> 01:02:49,394
We will teach you a lesson today.

426
01:02:50,813 --> 01:02:52,064
Damn dogs.

427
01:02:52,398 --> 01:02:53,816
Get up motherfucker.

428
01:02:56,443 --> 01:02:57,610
Damn faggot,

429
01:02:57,945 --> 01:02:59,947
bring me a rope.

430
01:02:59,989 --> 01:03:00,740
No sir... please.

431
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:01,489
Shut up you faggot.

432
01:03:01,532 --> 01:03:02,575
Don't worry, relax.

433
01:03:02,615 --> 01:03:04,034
I did not do anything sir.

434
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:06,077
You ass itching, right?

435
01:03:06,996 --> 01:03:09,164
Tie his hands.

436
01:03:10,291 --> 01:03:11,709
You also tie his hands.

437
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:15,211
Please sir.

438
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:17,673
Tie his hands properly.

439
01:03:21,427 --> 01:03:23,054
Tie them tightly.

440
01:03:25,056 --> 01:03:27,599
Take off this.

441
01:03:29,309 --> 01:03:30,769
Don't make noise.

442
01:03:31,144 --> 01:03:33,146
Hold him.

443
01:03:33,981 --> 01:03:35,483
Jassi, come and hold him.

444
01:03:35,815 --> 01:03:36,649
Hold him.

445
01:03:39,487 --> 01:03:41,489
Please sir.

446
01:03:45,409 --> 01:03:48,412
Jassi, go and bring me a peg.

447
01:03:49,413 --> 01:03:51,748
Keep quiet.

448
01:03:51,998 --> 01:03:54,834
You go there and hold him.

449
01:04:02,635 --> 01:04:04,095
Damn faggots.

450
01:04:04,679 --> 01:04:06,931
Look at it, just like baboon's ass.

451
01:04:07,181 --> 01:04:08,099
Keep it straight.

452
01:04:08,474 --> 01:04:09,642
Please sir.

453
01:04:10,016 --> 01:04:11,685
Don't you dare move.

454
01:04:15,356 --> 01:04:17,108
Sir please let us go.

455
01:04:20,568 --> 01:04:22,822
What are you doing?
Keep him quiet.

456
01:04:26,032 --> 01:04:27,451
Don't you dare move.

457
01:04:29,744 --> 01:04:30,788
Keep it straight

458
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:32,706
or else I will hurt more.

459
01:04:32,748 --> 01:04:34,750
Quiet.

460
01:04:36,876 --> 01:04:37,961
Don't move.

461
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:47,512
Quiet.

462
01:05:30,597 --> 01:05:32,099
Damn faggots.

463
01:05:35,978 --> 01:05:36,729
Sir...

464
01:05:37,063 --> 01:05:38,105
Can I also squeeze on them?

465
01:05:38,146 --> 01:05:39,230
Get me some water.

466
01:05:58,583 --> 01:05:59,210
Sir...

467
01:05:59,251 --> 01:06:00,628
it has been many days
since I squeezed my water.

468
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:01,753
Now they know.

469
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:03,630
It has been a very dry season sir.

470
01:06:03,672 --> 01:06:04,756
Give me more water.

471
01:06:05,757 --> 01:06:06,675
Can I go sir?

472
01:06:08,135 --> 01:06:08,803
Go.

473
01:06:09,594 --> 01:06:11,596
Don't wait, finish your work.

474
01:06:35,954 --> 01:06:36,746
Have you finished?

475
01:07:03,023 --> 01:07:05,025
Saini sahib... had fun?

476
01:07:05,985 --> 01:07:07,445
Come sit.

477
01:07:07,777 --> 01:07:09,112
I had complete fun.

478
01:07:10,572 --> 01:07:12,074
Make me a peg.

479
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:22,292
What happened?

480
01:07:23,753 --> 01:07:25,171
It was really tight.

481
01:07:26,088 --> 01:07:27,340
Really?

482
01:07:30,885 --> 01:07:32,178
Give me a cigarrate.

483
01:07:36,181 --> 01:07:38,183
Have you done it before?

484
01:07:39,726 --> 01:07:41,186
Even my wife cannot compete with this.

485
01:07:41,269 --> 01:07:42,021
Really?

486
01:07:43,938 --> 01:07:46,608
But for me, it was my first experience.

487
01:07:48,235 --> 01:07:49,487
Didn't you like it?

488
01:07:50,528 --> 01:07:51,614
It was...

489
01:07:51,905 --> 01:07:52,530
What?

490
01:07:53,574 --> 01:07:55,367
It happened really fast actually.

491
01:07:55,701 --> 01:07:57,702
We will bring them here again.

492
01:07:58,286 --> 01:08:00,288
From now onward they are ours.

493
01:08:25,564 --> 01:08:27,316
Saini sahib, could it become
a problem for us?

494
01:08:28,149 --> 01:08:30,152
There won't be any problem.

495
01:08:35,282 --> 01:08:37,284
If they told anyone about this?

496
01:08:38,868 --> 01:08:41,579
You tore his ass, he won't open
his mouth anymore.

497
01:09:29,462 --> 01:09:31,464
Damn motherfucker,
why are you still crying?

498
01:09:32,131 --> 01:09:34,759
Stop making noise or
I will throw you in the river.

499
01:09:57,489 --> 01:09:58,239
Motherfucker...

500
01:09:58,448 --> 01:09:59,491
If you say anything to anyone,

501
01:09:59,533 --> 01:10:01,327
next time I will shoot
you in the ass.

502
01:10:04,037 --> 01:10:05,455
Never come looking for us.

503
01:13:32,621 --> 01:13:34,039
Do you want some tea?

504
01:14:37,645 --> 01:14:39,605
I am going home for a few days.

505
01:14:39,979 --> 01:14:41,564
My family was pressuring me

506
01:14:41,981 --> 01:14:45,027
so I thought to visit them for a few days.

507
01:14:46,194 --> 01:14:48,197
I will come back in a few days.

508
