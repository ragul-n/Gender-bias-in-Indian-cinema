173
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:12,014
My business grows and you
too would make some money.

174
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:16,142
Else we end up as good-for-nothing.

175
00:18:16,936 --> 00:18:18,587
-We'll start a youtube channel...
-Why?

176
00:18:19,134 --> 00:18:21,704
As you are telling life lessons,
we would atleast get some likes and shares.

177
00:18:21,729 --> 00:18:26,602
Being sarcastic? My bad,
I am taking to you early in the morning.

178
00:18:26,825 --> 00:18:30,919
-Listen, take care of the shop. I will go to Jagadesh market for new panels.
-Ok

179
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:34,133
Nothing funny, take care of the shop.

180
00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:43,799
Hey, don't you take a break from?

181
00:18:43,824 --> 00:18:46,322
Already gave a week's break.

182
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:49,138
-For?
-From that girl in the colony.

183
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:52,788
Hey yuck, I'm not talking about girl,
I spoke about you meeting Siddhu.

184
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:57,183
He already works less,
why do you keep coming and disturb him.

185
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,374
I can't tolerate this.

[Humming friendship song]

187
00:19:07,107 --> 00:19:10,168
Hi dude,
I don't want to beat around the bush.

188
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:13,672
There's a new bike in the market, we are
launching it on our showroom tomorrow.

189
00:19:13,728 --> 00:19:15,347
Get dressed well and come to showroom.

190
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:17,926
What should I do at showroom,
wash bikes like you?

191
00:19:18,471 --> 00:19:21,609
We are pulling a lucky draw for guests,
customers, employees.

192
00:19:21,854 --> 00:19:23,634
-First prize is a home theatre.
-Is it?

193
00:19:24,148 --> 00:19:26,086
-Yeah.
-How are you sure I would get it.

194
00:19:26,568 --> 00:19:28,501
I will take care of it, you just come.

195
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,117
It's a home theatre.
You are unnessarily rising my expectations.

196
00:19:31,536 --> 00:19:34,023
I will smash you out,
if things don't go as you said.

197
00:19:34,223 --> 00:19:36,458
Don't worry I am here.
Pick me up tomorrow.

198
00:19:36,812 --> 00:19:38,327
What's that now? I'm not coming.

199
00:19:38,861 --> 00:19:40,772
-Do you want home theatre or not?
-Ah!

200
00:19:41,198 --> 00:19:44,601
Ok, but if I don't see my
name in the lucky draw...

201
00:19:44,979 --> 00:19:47,350
Cool dude, home theatre is yours.
How much money is in the counter?

202
00:19:47,684 --> 00:19:51,655
Looking angrily doesn't solve the problem.
Only beer can solve them.

203
00:19:51,687 --> 00:19:53,824
-How much is it?
-600

204
00:19:54,899 --> 00:19:58,096
Why do I need so much? 500 will do.
You keep this 100 for yourself.

205
00:19:58,718 --> 00:20:02,698
Ah, got money for the expenses.
Good boy! Come to pick up tomorrow, bye!

206
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:05,478
Ah... Got money..good boy...

207

Happiness grows with sharing.

212
00:21:42,474 --> 00:21:45,012
It remains as a memory
if you celebrate it.

213

We wish to turn this
hapiness into a sweet memory.

214

participated in this occasion,

215
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,598
We are going to pick one name as
a winner through a lucky draw.

216

We are going to give a

your gift would be a bonus.

Do yo have common sense?

229
00:24:00,475 --> 00:24:02,975
Why do I need common sense to wake you up?
Just water will do.

230
00:24:03,267 --> 00:24:06,090
A lazy fellow who sleeps till this
hour has no right to talk morals.

231

Get ready fast,
need to go to the showroom.

232
00:24:08,233 --> 00:24:09,741

-Something is fishy?
-Fishy? Is it?

235
00:24:14,638 --> 00:24:16,966
I should actually smash you
for what you did yesterday.

236
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,749
Forgave as you are my childhood bestie.

237

It's time for the showroom,
get ready in 5 minutes.

238
00:24:21,811 --> 00:24:23,877
Why are you bugging me
early in the morning?

239
00:24:24,072 --> 00:24:27,708
See, I have no much work,
not a problem though I go late to work.

240
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,840
No problem in going late?
Please dude, she will arrive by then.

241
00:24:32,287 --> 00:24:35,627
She will arrive? What dude, love?

242
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:38,169
Yes dude. [Laughs]

243
00:24:38,362 --> 00:24:41,609
It's totally a different feeling if
one's friend is in love with someone.

244
00:24:41,711 --> 00:24:44,404
Hey, I will make you love story a success.

245
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:47,394
That triumph in making one's
love success is unmatchable.

-Is it?
-Hmm.

Why hasn't she come yet?

253
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,534
Why there is no steering on this vehicle?

-Want to do servicing?
-Hey, was it a pun?

There are cc cameras all over. We may lose
our respect if anyone sees. Please leave.

258
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:29,382
We should be well mannered when at home
and at work. Rest doesn't matter much.

I mean, the bike is very good.

instead of searching around.

-Came for me, why don't you tell?

This is Mythri, a good friend outside,
but here she is my madam.

285
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:29,446
Now you tell me,
have you come for the bike or Yadu?

-I came for you.
-Ha?

I mean, he is my best friend
and he is your friend too.

288
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:36,356
So we too are friends. Aren't we?

289
00:28:37,905 --> 00:28:41,851
It's very unfair for two friends
being unfamiliar. So came to meet you.

He isn't getting this logic.
Atleast you try to understand.

much as they do on mobiles and hospitals.

But to show that they are alive,

336
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,178
there should be good communication.

and perfect, the more money we make.

00:50:05,015 --> 00:50:06,382
My phone got hanged.

520
00:50:06,565 --> 00:50:08,995
The display isn't visible
even if I turn it on.

521
00:50:09,425 --> 00:50:11,293
I don't know exactly what's happening.

522
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,346
It went off suddenly.

523
00:50:15,209 --> 00:50:16,319
From when?

524
00:50:17,169 --> 00:50:18,395
Just ten minutes.

525
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:20,011
It's not working.

526
00:50:20,114 --> 00:50:21,442
It'll take some time to repair, madam.

527
00:50:21,467 --> 00:50:23,050
I will check. Can you wait for sometime?

528
00:50:23,448 --> 00:50:26,199
Err... No. I have to go now.

529
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:28,968
But... okay I'll wait.

530
00:50:30,234 --> 00:50:31,675
-But, please make it fast.
-Okay.

531
00:50:31,803 --> 00:50:32,717
Thank you.

532
00:50:39,413 --> 00:50:40,641
Is it done?

533
00:50:46,521 --> 00:50:49,256
That fellow had lots
of luck backing him up.

534
00:50:49,457 --> 00:50:51,402
Or else one can't get a figure like that.

535
00:50:52,308 --> 00:50:53,926
-Lucky fellow.
-Yeah dude.

536
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:55,944
Lucky fellow.

537
00:51:00,158 --> 00:51:01,479
Hey.

538
00:51:01,504 --> 00:51:02,753
Photos.

539
00:51:03,301 --> 00:51:04,567
Hey, there's a video too.

540
00:52:01,214 --> 00:52:02,636
Dude, what a video!

541
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:04,878
Quality is too good.
The girl's in good shape!

542
00:52:05,387 --> 00:52:08,025
If we upload this video on YouTube,
it'll go wildly viral.

543
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:09,480
Hey. Stop your nonsense.

544
00:52:15,168 --> 00:52:16,457
-Hey, she's coming.
-Oh, no.

545
00:52:16,482 --> 00:52:17,720
One second, one second.

546
00:52:22,749 --> 00:52:24,046
-Is it done?
-Yes.

547
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:25,759
What's the problem?

548
00:52:25,977 --> 00:52:27,992
It hanged because of not updating the iOS.

549
00:52:29,342 --> 00:52:30,647
Okay. How much is it?

550
00:52:30,672 --> 00:52:32,222
-500 madam.
-500?

551
00:52:32,368 --> 00:52:33,727
-Yeah.
-Hmm...

552
00:52:36,424 --> 00:52:37,471
Thank you.

553
00:52:37,496 --> 00:52:38,566
Thank you, madam.

554
00:52:56,337 --> 00:52:57,462
Two months back.

555
00:52:57,834 --> 00:52:59,740
She committed suicide.

556
00:53:02,578 --> 00:53:03,500
[Sobs]

557
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,625
[Gasps]

558
00:53:12,976 --> 00:53:14,937
Our parents, or friends.

559
00:53:16,105 --> 00:53:18,949
Or even me with whom she share everything.

560
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,575
She haven't shared the problem this time.

561
00:53:21,919 --> 00:53:23,107
She just died.

562
00:53:24,212 --> 00:53:26,095
To commit suicide for small reasons.

563
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:29,120
Divya is not so weak minded,
to commit suicide Siddu.

564
00:53:29,655 --> 00:53:30,890
As a sister, I know.

565
00:53:31,518 --> 00:53:33,494
How sportive and strong she was.

566
00:53:34,659 --> 00:53:38,539
Post-mortem reports,
Police investigation and everything...

567
00:53:39,775 --> 00:53:43,550
...decided that it's a
suicide and closed the case.

568
00:53:45,535 --> 00:53:51,106
But I wanted to find out the
real reason behind her death.

569
00:53:52,721 --> 00:53:54,018
That's why I came to Hyderabad.

570
00:53:54,806 --> 00:53:57,275
I am meeting everyone who know Divya.

571
00:53:57,624 --> 00:54:00,715
I'm searching for the
reason for her suicide.

572
00:54:01,832 --> 00:54:03,090
But no use.

573
00:54:03,996 --> 00:54:08,136
There's an unseen and
un-traceable reason...

574
00:54:09,463 --> 00:54:10,783
...behind Divya's death.

575
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:13,373
No matter who are the
reason for Divya's death.

576
00:54:13,801 --> 00:54:15,520
I have to kill them myself.

577
00:54:15,832 --> 00:54:17,168
I need your support.

578
00:54:18,535 --> 00:54:19,754
Will you help me Siddu?

579
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:27,118
Dude, what a video!

580
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:29,575
Quality is too good.
The girl's in good shape!

581
00:54:30,081 --> 00:54:31,948
If we upload this video on YouTube!

582
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:33,273
It will go viral.

583
00:55:16,174 --> 00:55:19,150
Hey, don't drink so fast dude.

584
00:55:19,322 --> 00:55:22,143
You should drink slowly,
enjoying the taste.

585
00:55:22,514 --> 00:55:25,842
The girl whose video we saw that
day was Mythri's sister dude.

586
00:55:27,967 --> 00:55:29,420
-Mythri's sister?
-Yeah.

587
00:55:33,355 --> 00:55:35,230
Quality is too good.
The girl's in good shape!

588
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:36,747
Her name is Divya.

589
00:55:37,915 --> 00:55:38,994
Mythri's elder sister.

590
00:55:41,198 --> 00:55:42,776
She died committing suicide.

591
00:55:43,247 --> 00:55:44,794
That girl died?

592
00:55:45,284 --> 00:55:46,745
-Yeah.
-Mythri's sister?

593
00:55:46,881 --> 00:55:47,913
Yes.

594
00:55:49,951 --> 00:55:51,420
-What's her name?
-Divya.

595
00:55:51,809 --> 00:55:52,925
Divya.

596
00:55:53,781 --> 00:55:55,734
Did Mythri know that you know Divya?

597
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:58,371
-No.
-Don't tell her.

598
00:55:58,544 --> 00:55:59,784
Don't reveal it at all.

599
00:56:00,064 --> 00:56:01,712
If you tell her. We are finished.

600
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:04,098
God knows about your love.

601
00:56:04,432 --> 00:56:06,596
Me, you and your whole family
will be dragged to streets.

602
00:56:07,393 --> 00:56:09,057
Hey, I love Mythri dude.

603
00:56:09,477 --> 00:56:11,766
I can't live without her. I want her.

604
00:56:12,093 --> 00:56:13,608
Are you mad or what?

605
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,394
It's our life matter
and you want love now?

606
00:56:17,212 --> 00:56:18,759
Listen to me and forget her.

607
00:56:18,853 --> 00:56:20,002
Forget everything.

608
00:56:20,322 --> 00:56:22,470
It's better we stay away
from Mythri from now on.

609
00:56:23,704 --> 00:56:25,774
Hey, we need to be clever
in escaping our mistakes.

610
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:28,155
We shouldn't go to them
with all our details.

611
00:56:28,428 --> 00:56:30,460
We both will go to jail if we are caught.

612
00:56:30,733 --> 00:56:32,054
Please, listen to me.

613
00:56:32,649 --> 00:56:33,923
Please dude. [Phone ringing]

614
00:56:40,076 --> 00:56:41,342
-Hello?
-Siddu.

615
00:56:42,959 --> 00:56:44,490
Can we meet in the morning?

616
00:56:46,324 --> 00:56:47,824
I need to talk to you.

617
00:56:48,455 --> 00:56:49,650
I'll come Mythri.

618
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,291
Mythri called.

619
00:56:55,962 --> 00:56:58,525
-She wants to meet tomorrow.
-No. Don't go, please.

620
00:56:58,894 --> 00:57:00,699
Don't meet her. Please listen to me.

621
00:57:01,408 --> 00:57:03,283
I... I will meet Mythri tomorrow.

622
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:49,382
Yes, I'll get back to you.

623
00:57:50,174 --> 00:57:51,222
Sir.

624
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,502
Yes.

625
00:57:53,367 --> 00:57:54,187
How are you Ravi?

626
00:57:54,478 --> 00:57:55,028
Very good, sir.

627
00:57:55,226 --> 00:57:58,027
Among the suicide cases that took place
in the city in the last two months...

628
00:57:59,363 --> 00:58:01,184
...these three looked very strange.

629
00:58:01,567 --> 00:58:03,653
Divya, Mahalakshmi, Kalyani.

630
00:58:03,678 --> 00:58:04,795
Okay!

631
00:58:05,373 --> 00:58:07,256
Officially these three
cases have been closed.

632
00:58:07,438 --> 00:58:08,610
In the investigation,

633
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:11,855
even though they wrote letters that no
one is responsible for their deaths,

634
00:58:12,469 --> 00:58:13,961
we found out many common elements.

635
00:58:14,052 --> 00:58:14,622
-Okay sir!
-That's why.

636
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:18,478
That's why,
investigate these cases off the record.

637
00:58:18,678 --> 00:58:20,656
Yes, sir.

638
00:58:20,856 --> 00:58:21,003
And don't let anyone to escape.

639
00:58:21,406 --> 00:58:22,460
Definitely, sir.

640
00:58:24,629 --> 00:58:26,019
Yeah, send them in.

641
00:58:29,284 --> 00:58:29,850
-Sir.
-Sir.

642
00:58:30,062 --> 00:58:31,777
-They will assist you in this case.
-Hello, sir.

643
00:58:32,028 --> 00:58:32,768
Hi

644
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,763
There might be birth without a reason.

645
00:58:36,273 --> 00:58:37,359
Not death.

646
00:58:38,537 --> 00:58:40,724
I want to know the reason
for these three deaths.

647
00:58:41,223 --> 00:58:42,262
At least.

648
00:58:42,287 --> 00:58:44,735
We should stop another
from dying like this.

649
00:58:44,975 --> 00:58:45,998
Yes, sir.

650
00:58:47,682 --> 00:58:49,260
-Do the best.
-Will try my best.

651
00:58:49,537 --> 00:58:50,912
-Good luck.
-Thank you, sir.

652
00:59:13,568 --> 00:59:15,083
Just like my sister Divya...

653
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:17,936
...two others committed suicide Siddu.

654
00:59:21,531 --> 00:59:22,641
Who are they?

655
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:25,273
In the last two months.

656
00:59:26,085 --> 00:59:27,647
Software engineer Kalyani.

657
00:59:28,059 --> 00:59:29,567
And house wife Mahalakshmi also...

658
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,313
committed suicide.

659
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,889
According to my enquiry...

660
00:59:34,394 --> 00:59:35,860
Those two suicides were similar to

661
00:59:35,885 --> 00:59:37,795
Divya's suicide.

662
00:59:38,861 --> 00:59:40,143
Siddu.

663
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:42,756
It doesn't matter who believe me or not.

664
00:59:43,682 --> 00:59:45,245
Behind Divya's suicide...

665
00:59:45,427 --> 00:59:47,052
There's someone and it's a fact.

666
00:59:49,718 --> 00:59:51,585
How do you know about all these cases?

667
00:59:52,935 --> 00:59:54,865
Someone who used to be
in the police department.

668
00:59:55,139 --> 00:59:56,780
Retired officer Ranganath sir.

669
00:59:56,979 --> 00:59:59,135
He called me and updated
me with this information.

670
01:00:00,922 --> 01:00:02,743
In these three cases.

671
01:00:03,087 --> 01:00:04,501
He too found some similarities.

672
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,356
It's conform that my sister...

673
01:00:06,554 --> 01:00:07,921
She got killed by someone, Siddu.

674
01:00:11,539 --> 01:00:12,625
Calm down Mythri.

675
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,378
Divya. Age 22.

676
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,017
Software engineer.

677
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,295
Date of death, March 22nd.

678
01:00:47,389 --> 01:00:48,717
She died slicing her nerves.

679
01:00:49,735 --> 01:00:51,324
Kalyani. Age 25.

680
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:54,445
She used to work in Madhapur,
in an engineering projects institute.

681
01:00:54,658 --> 01:00:56,107
Date of death, April 16th.

682
01:00:56,525 --> 01:00:57,471
Cause of death.

683
01:00:57,671 --> 01:00:58,844
Overdose of sleeping pills.

684
01:00:59,925 --> 01:01:00,892
Number three.

685
01:01:01,106 --> 01:01:02,227
House wife, Mahalakshmi.

686
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:03,673
Age 29.

687
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:06,828
Date of death is May 14th.

688
01:01:08,487 --> 01:01:09,628
She hanged herself.

689
01:01:13,664 --> 01:01:15,312
Three suicides took place in three months.

690
01:01:15,582 --> 01:01:17,629
No complaints and no suspects.

691
01:01:18,366 --> 01:01:21,390
They wrote letters stating no one
is responsible for their deaths.

692
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:24,227
Are there really no reasons?

693
01:01:24,565 --> 01:01:25,620
Or is there someone?

694
01:01:26,175 --> 01:01:27,191
If so, who's that.

695
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:30,079
There's only one issue raising
doubts in all three cases.

696
01:01:31,507 --> 01:01:33,968
All three used to stay in
five kilometres of radius.

697
01:01:35,893 --> 01:01:37,369
Divya, Madhura nagar.

698
01:01:38,657 --> 01:01:39,938
Mahalakshmi, Krishna nagar.

699
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:42,858
And Kalyani, Madhapur.

700
01:01:46,206 --> 01:01:48,511
If there's someone who's
responsible for these deaths.

701
01:01:49,603 --> 01:01:52,361
They might also be operating
from these surroundings.

702
01:01:54,802 --> 01:01:56,036
-Satyam?
-Sir.

703
01:01:56,543 --> 01:01:58,067
Our investigation starts with...

704
01:01:58,725 --> 01:01:59,881
-Divya.
-okay, sir.

705
01:02:06,653 --> 01:02:07,724
Excuse me.

706
01:02:07,749 --> 01:02:08,801
I am Mythri.

707
01:02:08,945 --> 01:02:10,437
Want to meet Dr. Anand.

708
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:11,718
Just a second madam.

709
01:02:14,049 --> 01:02:15,682
[Phone ringing] Excuse me.

710
01:02:16,902 --> 01:02:19,660
-Hello?
-Ms. Mythri is here to meet you.

711
01:02:22,123 --> 01:02:23,436
Ask her to wait. I am coming.

712
01:02:23,522 --> 01:02:24,631
okay, sir.

713
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:28,277
Sir is busy with the client inside.

714
01:02:28,302 --> 01:02:29,686
He asked you to wait.

715
01:02:29,906 --> 01:02:31,609
-Please be seated.
-okay, thank you.

716
01:02:47,278 --> 01:02:48,427
Who's this guy!

717
01:02:48,813 --> 01:02:49,852
Sorry Mythri.

718
01:02:50,474 --> 01:02:51,958
Was busy with a client.

719
01:02:52,209 --> 01:02:53,279
It's okay Anand.

720
01:02:53,304 --> 01:02:54,926
-By the way, he's my friend Siddu.
-Hi.

721
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:56,073
Hello.

722
01:02:56,437 --> 01:02:57,546
Please be seated.

723
01:02:59,996 --> 01:03:01,121
Anand.

724
01:03:01,459 --> 01:03:03,083
Did you get to know any information?

725
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:05,202
You doubt anyone?

726
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:07,705
No.

727
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:09,695
I am trying all my sources.

728
01:03:10,258 --> 01:03:12,677
But, I'm unable to find what's
the reason for Divya's death.

729
01:03:13,154 --> 01:03:14,914
Did Divya call you on the day she died?

730
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,791
Yeah, she called me.

731
01:03:17,486 --> 01:03:18,791
But I didn't attend the call.

732
01:03:19,342 --> 01:03:20,639
I am in a session with clients.

733
01:03:21,021 --> 01:03:22,661
I called her back after one hour.

734
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,574
But no response from her.

735
01:03:25,323 --> 01:03:26,705
By the next morning...

736
01:03:27,783 --> 01:03:28,806
I heard the bad news.

737
01:03:28,948 --> 01:03:30,440
No matter how much we try.

738
01:03:31,598 --> 01:03:33,168
We are not even getting a small clue.

739
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:38,275
What if we lodge a complaint with
police to reinvestigate the case?

740
01:03:38,626 --> 01:03:40,767
Why involve the cops now?

741
01:03:41,071 --> 01:03:42,922
The issue will become big unnecessarily.

742
01:03:43,011 --> 01:03:44,714
Yes Mythri. He's correct.

743
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:46,854
If we go for police complaint now.

744
01:03:46,879 --> 01:03:49,021
Forget getting justice,
we had to roam around them.

745
01:03:49,267 --> 01:03:50,341
Yeah Siddu is correct.

746
01:03:50,898 --> 01:03:52,101
We can investigate ourselves.

747
01:03:52,599 --> 01:03:55,161
Let us find out the
reason for Divya's death.

748
01:03:57,073 --> 01:03:58,292
It's okay Anand.

749
01:03:58,688 --> 01:04:00,578
Ping me if you get to
know any information.

750
01:04:00,945 --> 01:04:01,992
Sure Mythri.

751
01:04:05,224 --> 01:04:06,136
-Bye Anand.
-Bye.

752
01:04:06,161 --> 01:04:06,955
-See you.
-Bye.

753
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,040
See you.

754
01:04:30,688 --> 01:04:31,770
I want to meet Mythri.

755
01:04:33,434 --> 01:04:34,457
Madam.

756
01:04:46,709 --> 01:04:47,755
I am Ravi Teja.

757
01:04:47,891 --> 01:04:49,923
Officer on special duty, Crime branch.

758
01:04:50,504 --> 01:04:52,770
Want to talk about your
sister Divya's suicide case.

759
01:04:53,324 --> 01:04:55,644
My sister Divya suicide case...

760
01:04:55,869 --> 01:04:57,236
When was it reopened?

761
01:04:57,696 --> 01:04:59,212
Who logged the complaint?

762
01:04:59,731 --> 01:05:00,794
No one complained.

763
01:05:01,776 --> 01:05:03,104
But in the last three months.

764
01:05:03,347 --> 01:05:04,715
Like your sister Divya.

765
01:05:04,922 --> 01:05:06,485
Two other women committed suicide.

766
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:08,434
But then.

767
01:05:08,459 --> 01:05:09,490
Surprisingly.

768
01:05:09,515 --> 01:05:12,545
There are so many similarities between
all these three specific cases.

769
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,075
That's why.

770
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:16,919
I am investigating this.

771
01:05:17,339 --> 01:05:19,975
In fact. I have my own doubts on my...

772
01:05:20,855 --> 01:05:21,887
...Sister's death.

773
01:05:21,912 --> 01:05:23,347
Do you suspect someone?

774
01:05:23,497 --> 01:05:25,263
Or when your sister talked to you.

775
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:26,962
Did she tell about any problem?

776
01:05:27,269 --> 01:05:29,566
Or any threat from anyone?

777
01:05:29,768 --> 01:05:32,222
No. She used to be very happy.

778
01:05:33,276 --> 01:05:34,745
Don't know what happened suddenly.

779
01:05:35,644 --> 01:05:36,896
I am confused.

780
01:05:37,291 --> 01:05:38,400
Oh, sorry.

781
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:39,957
Please control yourself.

782
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:49,206
He's Siddu. My friend.

783
01:05:49,437 --> 01:05:50,632
-Hello.
-He's Mr. Ravi.

784
01:05:50,782 --> 01:05:51,915
-Police officer.
-Huh?

785
01:05:52,126 --> 01:05:55,272
He's reinvestigating Divya's case.

786
01:05:57,975 --> 01:06:00,178
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, Mr. Siddu.

787
01:06:00,765 --> 01:06:02,171
-Please sit.
-It's okay sir.

788
01:06:03,778 --> 01:06:05,653
-Are you also working here?
-Well...

789
01:06:05,678 --> 01:06:08,171
No. Siddu is a cellphone mechanic.

790
01:06:08,749 --> 01:06:09,781
[Exhales]

791
01:06:11,076 --> 01:06:12,584
Cellphone mechanic Siddu.

792
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:13,796
Yes, sir.

793
01:06:13,821 --> 01:06:15,105
Mythri.

794
01:06:15,675 --> 01:06:17,018
How many days you know him from?

795
01:06:17,456 --> 01:06:18,870
From almost two months, sir.

796
01:06:19,317 --> 01:06:20,333
Okay.

797
01:06:20,462 --> 01:06:21,573
Why sir?

798
01:06:21,818 --> 01:06:23,232
Uhh, nothing.

799
01:06:23,817 --> 01:06:26,395
Mythri,
I had to meet you again regarding the case.

800
01:06:26,854 --> 01:06:27,956
I need your cooperation.

801
01:06:28,026 --> 01:06:29,057
Sure, sir.

802
01:06:43,135 --> 01:06:45,299
Leave that. Why did you come this way?

803
01:06:49,099 --> 01:06:50,208
Nothing Mythri.

804
01:07:02,323 --> 01:07:03,393
Okay, sir.

805
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,711
-Yes, sir?
-I want to meet Dr. Anand.

806
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:16,790
Yourself?

807
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:18,658
Ravi.

808
01:07:18,892 --> 01:07:20,134
Wait a minute.

809
01:07:23,484 --> 01:07:26,093
Sir there's someone
named Ravi to meet you.

810
01:07:26,166 --> 01:07:27,713
-Coming.
-Okay, sir.

811
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:31,195
Sir is coming. Please be seated.

812
01:07:31,283 --> 01:07:32,626
That's okay. I'll wait.

813
01:07:48,554 --> 01:07:49,812
I am Dr. Anand. You?

814
01:07:49,985 --> 01:07:51,782
-Ravi Teja. Crime Branch.
-Oh, okay.

815
01:07:51,962 --> 01:07:53,766
I want to talk to you
about Divya's suicide.

816
01:07:54,566 --> 01:07:56,332
Yeah, come sir. Let's sit inside and talk.

817
01:07:56,396 --> 01:07:57,466
-Please.
-Sure.

818
01:07:59,814 --> 01:08:01,291
-Please, sir.
-Thank you.

819
01:08:03,385 --> 01:08:04,698
When did you know Divya from?

820
01:08:05,101 --> 01:08:06,718
May be three years!

821
01:08:07,696 --> 01:08:08,711
How?

822
01:08:08,775 --> 01:08:10,848
You both are in different professions.

823
01:08:11,319 --> 01:08:13,506
For cancer awareness, we conducted a...

824
01:08:14,245 --> 01:08:16,775
Pink ribbon marathon in Necklace road.

825
01:08:16,808 --> 01:08:18,284
She participated in it.

826
01:08:19,059 --> 01:08:21,821
We met then.
And became friends afterwards.

827
01:08:22,786 --> 01:08:23,818
okay.

828
01:08:23,944 --> 01:08:25,662
Do both of you have any issues?

829
01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:26,861
No.

830
01:08:27,033 --> 01:08:28,111
Not a chance.

831
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:30,324
I thought of sharing life with her.

832
01:08:31,052 --> 01:08:33,230
Why would you say I will let her go?

833
01:08:33,333 --> 01:08:35,013
I haven't said you let her go!

834
01:08:36,075 --> 01:08:37,794
Ah, I mean... That's...

835
01:08:38,477 --> 01:08:39,524
It's okay.

836
01:08:41,293 --> 01:08:44,018
Do you think there can be any
other reasons for her suicide?

837
01:08:44,188 --> 01:08:45,863
I don't know anything. Please.

838
01:08:45,918 --> 01:08:47,324
Don't involve me in this case, sir.

839
01:08:47,349 --> 01:08:48,722
It's not personal Mr. Anand.

840
01:08:48,819 --> 01:08:49,944
I want to know the truth.

841
01:08:50,024 --> 01:08:51,391
I really have no idea, sir.

842
01:08:53,036 --> 01:08:55,978
If a girl you are in love with from
three years suddenly commits suicide.

843
01:08:56,009 --> 01:08:58,267
Even without a thought of
what might be the reason.

844
01:08:58,437 --> 01:08:59,640
-You are happy.
-Not like that.

845
01:08:59,665 --> 01:09:01,691
-I can't believe that.
-Nothing like that, sir.

846
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,139
I am already in lots of
depression from the loss.

847
01:09:05,675 --> 01:09:07,746
I can't handle these case pressures.

848
01:09:08,142 --> 01:09:09,142
okay.

849
01:09:10,636 --> 01:09:11,808
-Let's meet again.
-okay, sir.

850
01:09:14,835 --> 01:09:16,226
It might be you.

851
01:09:16,582 --> 01:09:17,691
Or someone else.

852
01:09:18,096 --> 01:09:20,025
No matter who's the
reason for Divya's death.

853
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:22,143
Will not escape law.
And I'll make sure of that.

854
01:09:23,351 --> 01:09:24,469
Thanks for your time.

855
01:09:25,306 --> 01:09:26,345
[Exhales]

856
01:09:37,285 --> 01:09:38,597
[Phone ringing]

857
01:09:41,572 --> 01:09:43,642
-Hello?
-What's the progress in the investigation?

858
01:09:43,863 --> 01:09:45,175
-Any update?
-Sir.

859
01:09:45,423 --> 01:09:47,470
We studied all three cases in detail, sir.

860
01:09:47,715 --> 01:09:49,879
We are enquiring the witnesses, sir.

861
01:09:49,904 --> 01:09:51,521
-And I will soon update you, sir.
-okay.

862
01:09:56,513 --> 01:09:58,012
Why didn't you complained to police?

863
01:09:58,037 --> 01:09:59,682
We know why she died.

864
01:09:59,818 --> 01:10:00,943
Why to complain again, sir?

865
01:10:00,968 --> 01:10:02,341
You know the reason of her death?

866
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:05,712
-Why?
-She used to suffer from stomach ache.

867
01:10:06,077 --> 01:10:07,741
I never tookay it seriously.

868
01:10:09,819 --> 01:10:11,873
Due to the variety of medicines she used.

869
01:10:12,739 --> 01:10:13,934
She got side effects.

870
01:10:15,485 --> 01:10:17,118
And her condition became more worse.

871
01:10:17,168 --> 01:10:18,332
Unable to bear that...

872
01:10:20,018 --> 01:10:21,174
My Lakshmi...

873
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:23,072
Committed suicide.

874
01:10:23,645 --> 01:10:25,387
Sorry for your loss, Mr. Prabhakar.

875
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:27,455
Please take care of yourself.

876
01:10:57,839 --> 01:10:58,870
Sir, you are?

877
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:01,973
Ravi Teja. Officer on special duty.
Crime branch.

878
01:11:02,059 --> 01:11:03,113
Oh, hello sir.

879
01:11:03,223 --> 01:11:04,308
Why are you here, sir?

880
01:11:04,756 --> 01:11:06,345
A girl named Kalyani committed suicide.

881
01:11:06,626 --> 01:11:08,173
That case was closed long back no sir?

882
01:11:08,481 --> 01:11:09,488
Why?

883
01:11:09,513 --> 01:11:11,022
You want it to be closed?

884
01:11:11,047 --> 01:11:12,894
[Stammering] Nothing like that.

885
01:11:13,074 --> 01:11:14,184
I just said that casually.

886
01:11:14,921 --> 01:11:15,992
I'll come to the point.

887
01:11:16,157 --> 01:11:17,329
What kind of girl is Kalyani?

888
01:11:17,354 --> 01:11:18,483
Who are her friends?

889
01:11:18,589 --> 01:11:19,769
Does she have any boyfriends?

890
01:11:19,929 --> 01:11:20,961
If so, who's he?

891
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:23,080
Do you suspect anyone?

892
01:11:23,977 --> 01:11:26,015
What problem does she
have to commit suicide.

893
01:11:27,817 --> 01:11:29,184
Did you pressure her?

894
01:11:29,336 --> 01:11:30,399
What is this sir?

895
01:11:31,505 --> 01:11:32,576
Are you...

896
01:11:32,778 --> 01:11:34,942
investigating or interrogating me?

897
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:36,153
Why?

898
01:11:36,573 --> 01:11:38,385
Do you want to see how
an interrogation goes?

899
01:11:39,647 --> 01:11:40,725
I don't mean that, sir.

900
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:42,445
See.

901
01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:44,998
When a girl in your office
dies committing suicide.

902
01:11:45,466 --> 01:11:48,146
Won't you do a minimum
enquiry on why she died?

903
01:11:49,556 --> 01:11:50,916
I need full details of Kalyani.

904
01:11:51,737 --> 01:11:52,880
Sorry, sir.

905
01:11:53,616 --> 01:11:56,164
You suddenly came from the
department and asking me questions.

906
01:11:56,342 --> 01:11:57,780
I am feeling little nervous.

907
01:11:59,323 --> 01:12:00,777
Kalyani is a nice girl, sir.

908
01:12:01,224 --> 01:12:03,075
Calm going, sincere employee.

909
01:12:04,803 --> 01:12:07,475
But we don't know personal
details like boyfriends.

910
01:12:08,733 --> 01:12:09,795
One second sir.

911
01:12:11,311 --> 01:12:12,358
HR?

912
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:14,587
Yeah. Get me Kalyani's personal file.

913
01:12:14,886 --> 01:12:15,886
okay.

914
01:12:17,354 --> 01:12:18,379
Sir.

915
01:12:18,404 --> 01:12:20,572
There's no company involvement
in this matter, sir.

916
01:12:21,703 --> 01:12:22,835
Please sir, trust me.

917
01:12:25,022 --> 01:12:26,562
Whenever you want any information.

918
01:12:26,857 --> 01:12:28,287
I am ready to cooperate.

919
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:31,035
If this issue becomes big.

920
01:12:31,288 --> 01:12:32,663
Company will get bad name, sir.

921
01:12:32,837 --> 01:12:35,071
Remaining employees careers
will also get effected, sir.

922
01:12:35,467 --> 01:12:36,827
Sir, Kalyani file.

923
01:12:38,233 --> 01:12:39,592
Kalyani personal file sir.

924
01:12:47,904 --> 01:12:48,978
Thank you.

925
01:12:50,251 --> 01:12:52,313
-Will come to enquiry if needed.
-okay, sir.

926
01:13:05,321 --> 01:13:06,790
My dear staff members.

927
01:13:10,191 --> 01:13:12,387
If any one of you want to commit suicide.

928
01:13:12,412 --> 01:13:14,119
Tell me first.

929
01:13:14,776 --> 01:13:15,846
Don't give me tension.

930
01:13:20,948 --> 01:13:22,057
[Sniffing]

931
01:13:51,217 --> 01:13:52,264
okay, one second.

932
01:13:54,482 --> 01:13:55,584
Thank you. [Sniffs]

933
01:13:56,834 --> 01:13:58,060
-Satyam?
-Sir.

934
01:13:59,274 --> 01:14:00,821
Divya, Kalyani, Mahalakshmi.

935
01:14:01,037 --> 01:14:03,062
Before committing suicide
whom do they talked to?

936
01:14:03,087 --> 01:14:05,001
Where did they go and whom did they meet?

937
01:14:05,343 --> 01:14:07,171
And are there any family side issues?

938
01:14:07,474 --> 01:14:08,989
-I need all those details.
-Yes, sir.

939
01:14:09,014 --> 01:14:10,823
-And one more thing.
-Three months call data.

940
01:14:10,917 --> 01:14:11,964
Good.

941
01:14:14,326 --> 01:14:15,936
Sir, post-mortem reports.

942
01:14:22,887 --> 01:14:23,918
Damn.

943
01:14:26,171 --> 01:14:28,840
There's some common element
in these three suicides.

944
01:14:29,428 --> 01:14:30,519
Might be pressure, sir.

945
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:33,223
Pressure.

946
01:14:34,669 --> 01:14:35,670
Who gave them that?

947
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,951
I became very lonely Siddu.

948
01:14:48,809 --> 01:14:50,825
It feels very lonely.

949
01:14:52,013 --> 01:14:53,825
The fact that I have no one.

950
01:14:54,569 --> 01:14:56,491
Is so disturbing to the heart.

951
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:00,448
When our mom died in our childhood.

952
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:03,221
Dad tookay care of us.

953
01:15:03,741 --> 01:15:05,960
He raised us with lots of love.

954
01:15:06,405 --> 01:15:09,522
Me, my sister and dad.
We used to be so happy.

955
01:15:09,969 --> 01:15:11,531
[Laughs] Stop there.

956
01:15:13,984 --> 01:15:15,031
-Stop.
-See dad.

957
01:15:20,888 --> 01:15:22,036
Stop.

958
01:15:22,234 --> 01:15:23,400
They won't listen.

959
01:15:27,664 --> 01:15:28,742
For sake of a job.

960
01:15:29,473 --> 01:15:30,786
She came to the city.

961
01:15:32,282 --> 01:15:34,313
This suicide news came at once.

962
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:37,013
We don't know the reason, but...

963
01:15:37,124 --> 01:15:39,452
Without even thinking,
people in our village...

964
01:15:41,342 --> 01:15:43,358
Made stories of their own.

965
01:15:43,765 --> 01:15:45,140
About his own daughter.

966
01:15:45,392 --> 01:15:46,752
After hearing such nonsense.

967
01:15:48,448 --> 01:15:50,309
No father can bear that heart ache.

968
01:16:01,469 --> 01:16:03,344
My mom left me when I was a child.

969
01:16:06,179 --> 01:16:09,556
Reasons behind my own
sister's death were erased.

970
01:16:11,094 --> 01:16:12,946
My father who used to
take so much care of me.

971
01:16:13,592 --> 01:16:15,428
Left me in middle of all this.

972
01:16:16,375 --> 01:16:17,992
And I became all lonely Siddu.

973
01:16:18,204 --> 01:16:20,595
There might be birth without a reason.

974
01:16:21,495 --> 01:16:22,589
Not death.

975
01:16:24,167 --> 01:16:25,878
What's the reason behind Divya's death?

976
01:16:27,209 --> 01:16:29,663
And the person behind that reason.
I need to know.

977
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:40,173
Don't worry Mythri.

978
01:16:40,924 --> 01:16:42,431
You will get to know everything soon.

979
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:46,668
Trust me.

980
01:16:54,091 --> 01:16:56,240
Sir, the call data of Divya,
Kalyani and Mahalakshmi.

981
01:16:56,265 --> 01:16:57,405
Did you check it in detail?

982
01:16:57,501 --> 01:17:00,353
Yes, sir. They all received
continuous calls from unknown numbers.

983
01:17:00,432 --> 01:17:02,778
-Who's numbers are those?
-The number Divya got call from.

984
01:17:02,803 --> 01:17:04,981
It's from Saroor Nagar,
Bharani Homes apartments.

985
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:06,984
It's on house wife Usha Rani's name.

986
01:17:07,026 --> 01:17:08,736
The number Kalyani got call from.

987
01:17:08,854 --> 01:17:11,807
It's from Satyavathi,
who's running a milk booth in Malkajgiri.

988
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:13,739
The number Mahalakshmi got call from.

989
01:17:14,272 --> 01:17:17,226
It's from Suseela,
working as a clerk in the secretariat, sir.

990
01:17:19,049 --> 01:17:21,720
Have you enquired the relation
between the callers and the victims?

991
01:17:21,789 --> 01:17:22,992
Friends or relatives?

992
01:17:23,148 --> 01:17:24,218
-Checked it?
-No, sir.

993
01:17:24,246 --> 01:17:25,590
-Yeah, Anji?
-Sir.

994
01:17:26,256 --> 01:17:27,856
To whom those numbers actually belong?

995
01:17:27,915 --> 01:17:29,970
What's their relation to the victims?

996
01:17:30,416 --> 01:17:31,783
And. Why did they call?

997
01:17:32,223 --> 01:17:33,246
What did they speak?

998
01:17:33,514 --> 01:17:35,834
-I need all these details. okay?
-okay, sir.

999
01:17:36,001 --> 01:17:38,040
-Keep going.
-We checked CC footage also, sir.

1000
01:17:38,257 --> 01:17:40,320
There's a common place
these three women went to.

1001
01:17:40,744 --> 01:17:42,017
Common place? What's that?

1002
01:17:42,042 --> 01:17:43,379
Cellphone service centre.

1003
01:17:43,462 --> 01:17:45,056
-Cellphone service centre?
-Yes, sir.

1004
01:17:45,246 --> 01:17:47,489
Inside the cellphone service centre CCTV.

1005
01:17:47,558 --> 01:17:49,532
It's been recorded that
these three were there.

1006
01:17:50,212 --> 01:17:51,478
Who's the owner of that centre?

1007
01:17:51,823 --> 01:17:53,245
It's on the name of Siva Ram, sir.

1008
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:54,849
Siva Ram!

1009
01:17:54,874 --> 01:17:56,279
Cellphone service centre.

1010
01:17:58,401 --> 01:17:59,837
Siddu is a cellphone mechanic.

1011
01:18:00,561 --> 01:18:01,568
Yes.

1012
01:18:02,107 --> 01:18:03,450
If there's someone named Siddu.

1013
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:04,785
-He's a mechanic okay?
-Sir.

1014
01:18:04,951 --> 01:18:06,919
-If he's there. Pick him up immediately.
-okay, sir.

1015
01:18:06,944 --> 01:18:08,227
Get him. And by the way.

1016
01:18:08,332 --> 01:18:09,683
-Get the owner also.
-okay, sir.

1017
01:18:10,776 --> 01:18:12,340
Cellphone mechanic Siddu.

1018
01:18:12,841 --> 01:18:14,279
Cellphone service centre.

1019
01:18:16,161 --> 01:18:17,872
Mythri. Divya.

1020
01:18:19,079 --> 01:18:20,555
Something is connected.

1021
01:18:46,401 --> 01:18:48,127
What sir? Why did you bring me?

1022
01:18:48,804 --> 01:18:49,819
[Sniffs]

1023
01:18:50,227 --> 01:18:52,078
I don't understand what's happening here,
sir.

1024
01:18:52,236 --> 01:18:53,509
You will understand everything.

1025
01:18:54,349 --> 01:18:56,420
First answer to me properly.

1026
01:18:56,783 --> 01:18:58,258
Sir without telling me the topic and

1027
01:18:58,283 --> 01:19:00,119
explaining the matter,
who can I answer sir?

1028
01:19:00,948 --> 01:19:03,103
Also you seem to have
something else in your mind.

1029
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:05,394
From when did you know Mythri?

1030
01:19:05,839 --> 01:19:07,277
I told you last time no, sir?

1031
01:19:07,568 --> 01:19:09,951
From when did you know Mythri?

1032
01:19:11,803 --> 01:19:13,436
From two months, sir.

1033
01:19:14,314 --> 01:19:15,415
How?

1034
01:19:16,304 --> 01:19:18,648
I went to the showroom
for my friend Yadhu.

1035
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:20,252
We met there.

1036
01:19:21,463 --> 01:19:22,595
Okay.

1037
01:19:22,857 --> 01:19:24,123
Then Mythri's sister.

1038
01:19:24,714 --> 01:19:26,125
Divya. From when did you know her?

1039
01:19:27,225 --> 01:19:29,145
[Stammering]

1040
01:19:29,333 --> 01:19:31,075
I know that Divya is Mythri's sister, sir.

1041
01:19:31,558 --> 01:19:32,941
But I never met her, sir.

1042
01:19:34,208 --> 01:19:36,090
I don't even know any details about her,
sir.

1043
01:19:37,368 --> 01:19:39,860
Divya came to your shop
for her cellphone repair.

1044
01:19:41,127 --> 01:19:42,432
Why would Divya come to my shop?

1045
01:19:42,812 --> 01:19:43,883
She didn't sir.

1046
01:19:45,015 --> 01:19:46,633
So you really don't know Divya?

1047
01:19:48,536 --> 01:19:49,833
No. I don't know, sir.

1048
01:19:55,895 --> 01:19:58,673
Sir, I know that this girl
is Mythri's sister Divya.

1049
01:20:00,623 --> 01:20:04,379
I felt really bad when I got to
know that she committed suicide.

1050
01:20:07,535 --> 01:20:09,968
but..I don't remember her
coming to our shop sir, no.

1051
01:20:10,879 --> 01:20:12,632
Recollect correctly.

1052
01:20:14,366 --> 01:20:18,343
This girl came to your cellphone centre.
We have the video footage too.

1053
01:20:19,939 --> 01:20:23,018
I don't know sir,
so many people will be coming to our shop..

1054
01:20:23,599 --> 01:20:25,249
...I can't possible remember everyone sir.

1055
01:20:25,814 --> 01:20:26,988
You know how it works.

1056
01:20:27,251 --> 01:20:30,763
There won't be any repeat customers
once they get their phone repaired

1057
01:20:31,242 --> 01:20:32,264
Don't know sir.

1058
01:20:32,523 --> 01:20:34,212
Hmm... then...

1059
01:20:37,906 --> 01:20:38,912
..did you see them earlier?

1060
01:20:47,329 --> 01:20:47,972
I don't know sir.

1061
01:20:49,544 --> 01:20:52,720
Good, because even they came
to your cellphone centre.

1062
01:20:52,991 --> 01:20:56,723
and unfortunately they are dead,
they committed suicide.

1063
01:20:57,783 --> 01:20:59,233
Can you understand the intensity?

1064
01:20:59,433 --> 01:21:00,778
How am I related to them sir?

1065
01:21:02,445 --> 01:21:04,471
So many unknown people
come to my shop for repair.

1066
01:21:04,671 --> 01:21:07,817
If few of them die of their own reasons,
how can you bring me sir?

1067
01:21:08,017 --> 01:21:10,064
I... I don't know anything sir.

1068
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:15,655
You are intentionally framing me sir.

1069
01:21:16,473 --> 01:21:18,782
By doing this,
you want to distance me from Mythri.

1070
01:21:19,468 --> 01:21:23,322
Please sir, don't do that,
please don't seperate me and Mythri.

1071
01:21:23,522 --> 01:21:25,868
I didn't even tell Mythri that I love her.

1072
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:30,542
-You love Mythri?
-Yes sir, I love her.

1073
01:21:31,362 --> 01:21:34,150
But don't tell this to Mythri,
I have to tell her.

1074
01:21:34,961 --> 01:21:36,388
But I don't have anything
to do with Divya's death.

1075
01:21:36,588 --> 01:21:40,860
Hey! Don't you really know Divya?
Don't you lie.

1076
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:42,774
Sir, I swear sir, I really don't know sir.

1077
01:21:45,587 --> 01:21:47,092
Who will be in your shop along with you?

1078
01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:49,141
Me and our shop's owner.

1079
01:21:49,341 --> 01:21:50,783
-Shivram!
-Yeah, yeah I know.

1080
01:21:53,232 --> 01:21:54,391
Nobody else comes to your shop?

1081
01:21:54,591 --> 01:21:58,131
No sir, oh yes, my friend Yadav
will be coming often to meet me.

1082
01:21:58,331 --> 01:21:59,331
Ok, Yadav, note it down.

1083
01:21:59,531 --> 01:22:02,474
[sighs]

1084
01:22:03,930 --> 01:22:06,060
-Go, go now.
-Thank you sir.

1085
01:22:07,028 --> 01:22:10,388
Hey, I just had a doubt on you now.

1086
01:22:12,479 --> 01:22:13,494
If that turns out to be a truth..

1087
01:22:13,794 --> 01:22:16,981
Sir, what is this again sir?
Please sir, I am nowhere related sir.

1088
01:22:34,672 --> 01:22:39,133
Sindham Yadagiri,
a.k.a Yadav, bike mechanic.

1089
01:22:40,307 --> 01:22:41,499
Stays at Jubilee hills slum.

1090
01:22:41,699 --> 01:22:44,717
Everything is right sir,
you just missed my blood group, O-

1091
01:22:44,917 --> 01:22:46,017
I know.

1092
01:22:46,217 --> 01:22:48,061
-What sir?
-That your's is a negative mind.

1093
01:22:48,261 --> 01:22:50,484
If it's O negative, mind will be negative?
How will it be? I won't agree.

1094
01:22:50,684 --> 01:22:51,684
Hey stop!

1095
01:22:54,696 --> 01:22:57,508
-From how long do you know siddu?
-We are friends from childhood.

1096
01:22:58,125 --> 01:23:00,138
-Then Mythri?
-Recently sir

1097
01:23:03,739 --> 01:23:05,469
Don't you know anything
about Mythri's sister Divya?

1098
01:23:05,669 --> 01:23:08,576
Oh my god, I don't know anything sir,
I know that Mythri's sister is Divya..

1099
01:23:08,676 --> 01:23:11,126
..and Divya committed suicide
but I am nowhere related sir.

1100
01:23:11,326 --> 01:23:12,326
Hey sit down!

1101
01:23:13,126 --> 01:23:14,204
Recollect well.

1102
01:23:14,404 --> 01:23:17,107
Were you there when Divya came
to Siddu's cellphone repair shop?

1103
01:23:17,684 --> 01:23:19,973
I swear on my mom, I don't know anything.

1104
01:23:20,154 --> 01:23:21,962
you are framing me in this case.
please sir.

1105
01:23:22,508 --> 01:23:24,931
-Atleast do you doubt anyone?
-No sir.

1106
01:23:25,131 --> 01:23:28,219
I'll go to shop in the morning and come,
I'll meet siddu in the evening...

1107
01:23:28,419 --> 01:23:30,692
I'll have two beers and a biryani in
the night and I'll sleep. That's it sir.

1108
01:23:30,892 --> 01:23:35,141
The reason between those three deaths
should either be you or that Siddu.

1109
01:23:35,341 --> 01:23:36,176
No sir.

1110
01:23:36,376 --> 01:23:39,287
Siddu and I have no connection with this,
we don't even know who are they.

1111
01:23:39,521 --> 01:23:42,363
I'll go to that shop for timepass,
if I knew this would happen...

1112
01:23:42,563 --> 01:23:44,763
...I wouldn't have gone
to that shop or that road.

1113
01:23:44,963 --> 01:23:48,147
I'm getting tensed for the first time in
life. I don't understand what's happening.

1114
01:23:48,347 --> 01:23:50,815
-Please sir, leave me.
-Go.

1115
01:23:52,945 --> 01:23:56,523
-But, I'll call you again when needed.
-Okay sir, bye sir.

1116
01:24:23,063 --> 01:24:27,322
[cellphone ringing]

1117
01:24:29,201 --> 01:24:30,677
-Hello?
-Are you happy now?

1118
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:34,246
Divya might've committed suicide,
it might be due to some hundred reasons..

1119
01:24:34,446 --> 01:24:38,657
...but is it right to target me for being
friendly and Siddu being close with you?

1120
01:24:38,857 --> 01:24:39,757
Yadav, what happend?

1121
01:24:39,957 --> 01:24:42,993
Look, you are completely responsible
if something happens to us.

1122
01:24:43,193 --> 01:24:44,193
I can't understand anything.

1123
01:24:44,393 --> 01:24:46,622
If we are friendly,
Police will take us like thieves?

1124
01:24:46,886 --> 01:24:51,031
Will they interrogate? If Siddu's parents
knows about this, won't they be scared?

1125
01:24:51,231 --> 01:24:53,789
-Who took you?
-Who else? That special officer Ravi.

1126
01:24:54,062 --> 01:24:56,599
-Where is Siddu now?
-Does it matter Mythri?

1127
01:24:56,799 --> 01:24:59,774
God knows about Divya's death,
but we are getting framed unneccesarily.

1128
01:25:01,176 --> 01:25:04,932
Look, Siddu is a nice guy,
I don't want him to suffer beacause of you.

1129
01:25:05,942 --> 01:25:09,648
I tried convincing him, he isn't listening
to me, I am getting tensed because of him.

1130
01:25:11,539 --> 01:25:14,015
[sighs]

1131
01:25:31,775 --> 01:25:32,366
Sir...

1132
01:25:32,741 --> 01:25:37,607
Lot of people come to my shop for
cellphone repair, pouches or screengaurds.

1133
01:25:37,807 --> 01:25:39,987
How am I responsible if
something happens to them sir?

1134
01:25:40,187 --> 01:25:42,339
I don't know anything about
this untill you told me sir.

1135
01:25:42,994 --> 01:25:46,530
-Didn't you see any of these 3?
-I didn't see sir. Didn't see.

1136
01:25:47,042 --> 01:25:48,317
but they came to your shop.

1137
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,618
They might've come sir,
but I might not be in the shop then.

1138
01:25:52,732 --> 01:25:54,756
-If you go out, who will be in the shop?
-Siddu sir.

1139
01:25:55,490 --> 01:25:58,500
He'll only repair all these cellphones,
he'll be there if I am not in shop.

1140
01:25:59,805 --> 01:26:03,926
-Do you have any doubt on Siddu?
-no sir, he is a very nice guy.

1141
01:26:04,664 --> 01:26:08,870
He repairs cellphone very well,
but he is a bit lazy in work, that's it.

1142
01:26:09,995 --> 01:26:12,340
-What about Yadav?
-Yadav, he is a waste fellow.

1143
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:15,967
He'll come and disturb him
sometimes while he is working.

1144
01:26:16,167 --> 01:26:17,167
That's why I didn't like him sir.

1145
01:26:17,950 --> 01:26:20,663
-but sir, someone somewhere did something.
-hey!

1146
01:26:21,482 --> 01:26:23,141
..It's wrong to doubt me no sir?

1147
01:26:23,341 --> 01:26:24,485
If something happens unexpectedly,
it's an accident.

1148
01:26:25,631 --> 01:26:26,680
If someone plans and kills, it's a murder.

1149
01:26:27,751 --> 01:26:31,360
but these people didn't die of accident
or murder, they committed suicide.

1150
01:26:32,242 --> 01:26:35,217
Untill I find out the reason
behind it and who is responsible...

1151
01:26:35,665 --> 01:26:36,736
I won't leave any clue.

1152
01:26:36,959 --> 01:26:41,641
Sir, trust me sir. For me it's my shop,
my house, my family, that's it sir..

1153
01:26:41,845 --> 01:26:43,295
...I don't have another
world other than that.

1154
01:26:44,117 --> 01:26:45,777
I really don't know anything sir.

1155
01:26:46,805 --> 01:26:47,137
Go.

1156
01:27:08,943 --> 01:27:13,573
Look sir, Siddu is a good guy.

1157
01:27:14,398 --> 01:27:19,561
He is more than a friend to me.
I requested him to help me.

1158
01:27:20,308 --> 01:27:25,106
but if he is getting into trouble
because of me, I am not liking it.

1159
01:27:25,797 --> 01:27:30,008
You are a sincere officer,
that's why I am requesting you..

1160
01:27:31,744 --> 01:27:35,613
...please don't involve
Siddu in Divya's case.

1161
01:27:36,757 --> 01:27:42,345
I know about Siddu, there's no
connection of Siddu to this case.

1162
01:27:42,545 --> 01:27:43,545
Please sir.

1163
01:27:43,948 --> 01:27:46,362
If a crime happens and
somebody is effected by it...

1164
01:27:47,876 --> 01:27:49,775
Law will know the reasons
behind the crime...

1165
01:27:50,321 --> 01:27:52,670
...and punish the person
who commited the crime.

1166
01:27:53,099 --> 01:27:55,385
In our investigation, we'll question
so many people through interrogations.

1167
01:27:55,585 --> 01:27:58,804
That doesn't mean all the persons who
got interrogated has committed a crime.

1168
01:28:00,309 --> 01:28:03,192
To uncover the truth and to prevent
the criminal from escaping...

1169
01:28:03,392 --> 01:28:06,597
...Law and order will be working
on it always and so is my job.

1170
01:28:07,839 --> 01:28:09,861
I don't work as per
your opinions on Siddu.

1171
01:28:11,033 --> 01:28:15,054
It's purely your personal feeling,
just wait for two days..

1172
01:28:15,889 --> 01:28:20,823
you'll find the answer for your questions,
for your trust and for your search.

01:28:45,418 --> 01:28:50,486
Sadness will reduce if we share it,
happiness will increase if we share it.

1176
01:28:52,088 --> 01:28:54,749
If we share our problem,
we'll find a solution,

1177
01:28:54,949 --> 01:28:58,110
or we'll get the strength
to fight the problem.

1178
01:28:58,818 --> 01:29:00,620
My father told this to me.

1179
01:29:01,791 --> 01:29:05,523
That's why, I shared my problem with you.

1180
01:29:05,723 --> 01:29:07,846
I asked for your help but..

1181
01:29:11,061 --> 01:29:15,346
..in the process of helping me,
I didn't expect that it..

1182
01:29:16,292 --> 01:29:19,315
..will become a trouble for you Siddu.
I am sorry.

1183
01:29:21,206 --> 01:29:23,980
I am feeling guilty for what happend.

1184
01:29:28,386 --> 01:29:29,595
Your problem is my responsibility.

1185
01:29:30,627 --> 01:29:34,063
I have to answer your every
question and I will answer.

Even if anyone creates trouble
or issue in this process,

01:29:38,534 --> 01:29:39,603
I won't get scared and runaway.

1188
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:42,148
Because every moment
in my life is for you.

01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:21,677
"If I am with you, I will be disappeared"

01:33:21,877 --> 01:33:27,816

1220
01:33:41,852 --> 01:33:45,931

1221
01:33:46,131 --> 01:33:47,131
[door clicks]

1222
01:33:49,792 --> 01:33:51,919

[gasps]

1227
01:35:58,877 --> 01:35:59,332
hey!

1228
01:36:02,242 --> 01:36:02,668
hey

1229
01:36:17,947 --> 01:36:18,407
[groans]

1230
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:28,976
[horns honking]

1231
01:36:31,063 --> 01:36:31,642
hey

1232
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:45,092
[struggling]

1233
01:36:59,218 --> 01:36:59,845
[groans]

1234
01:37:02,901 --> 01:37:03,542
hey

1235
01:38:32,579 --> 01:38:35,007
Siddu, here's tea,
have it quickly, it'll get cold.

1236
01:38:39,043 --> 01:38:39,934
What happend son?

1237
01:38:43,107 --> 01:38:46,290
-You seem tensed?
-Nothing mom, you go.

1238
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:50,590
-What happened dear?
-I said nothing, don't irritate me.

1239
01:38:52,742 --> 01:38:53,183
Dad.

1240
01:38:56,305 --> 01:38:58,720
[crying] Mom!

1241
01:39:01,285 --> 01:39:06,119
If you are getting irritated like this,
you might've done some mistake

1242
01:39:06,759 --> 01:39:09,629
or you might be the reason
behind that mistake.

1243
01:39:11,327 --> 01:39:15,778
Problems won't solve if you shout or get
tensed, you have to think pleasantly.

1244
01:39:16,369 --> 01:39:19,559
Any father might not know
his son's greatness but

1245
01:39:20,106 --> 01:39:22,127
he'll immediately know when
his son has done a mistake.

1246
01:39:22,882 --> 01:39:27,323
An umbrella might not stop the rain,
but it'll protect us from getting wet.

1247
01:39:28,314 --> 01:39:32,269
Same way I might not
solve your problem but..

1248
01:39:33,050 --> 01:39:36,735
I'll try to protect you son. I'll try.

1249
01:39:38,331 --> 01:39:40,839
I'll try son. [crying]

1250
01:39:47,087 --> 01:39:49,351
-Good morning sir
-Yes Ravi, any information?

1251
01:39:49,551 --> 01:39:51,814
Yes sir,
I have all the details in this file

1252
01:39:52,174 --> 01:39:55,030
-Who all are there?
-It's one guy sir.

1253
01:39:55,501 --> 01:39:57,467
One guy? Who?

1254
01:39:57,831 --> 01:40:01,655
For all the three suicides,
he's the thinker, planner and executer.

1255
01:40:02,511 --> 01:40:06,300
And we have all the evidences. What do
you want me to sir? Let's proceed legally?

1256
01:40:09,149 --> 01:40:11,545
In the country where we pray to women...

1257
01:40:12,322 --> 01:40:16,295
..now it has became one of the countries
where women are getting hugely harrased.

1258
01:40:17,571 --> 01:40:19,284
My heart aches on that thought Ravi.

1259
01:40:20,907 --> 01:40:24,357
Girl children are being
killed in the mother's womb

1260
01:40:24,662 --> 01:40:27,519
In schools, colleges,
in offices they work..

1261
01:40:28,097 --> 01:40:30,194
In in-laws house, in buses and trains..

1262
01:40:31,098 --> 01:40:32,054
[sighs]

1263
01:40:32,254 --> 01:40:36,169
Everywhere women are being assaulted.

1264
01:40:36,781 --> 01:40:38,347
Now, recently, it's cyber crimes.

1265
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:41,672
To stop them government has implemented
child welfare, women protection force...

1266
01:40:41,893 --> 01:40:46,023
..Nirbhaya law, she teams. In
how many ways they are trying..

1267
01:40:46,403 --> 01:40:51,157
how many CC cameras might be installed
for surveillance to protect them..

1268
01:40:52,082 --> 01:40:57,638
The beasts who are not visible to eyes
are attacking women and girl children.

1269
01:40:59,389 --> 01:41:05,106
So many lives are ending midway. These
kind of people are reason for all this

1270
01:41:05,976 --> 01:41:09,144
Ravi, do you know what's more pathetic?

1271
01:41:10,365 --> 01:41:14,060
A person being not able to tell
the reason for their situation..

1272
01:41:15,057 --> 01:41:16,433
..and committing suicide.

1273
01:41:17,656 --> 01:41:21,054
How scared they might be and what
pain they might've gone through...

1274
01:41:21,864 --> 01:41:23,324
...that they've come to such decision?

1275
01:41:25,568 --> 01:41:29,225
What should we do with the person who is
the reason behind those kind of deaths?

1276
01:41:29,425 --> 01:41:31,265
-I'll take care of it sir
-Yes.

1277
01:41:33,289 --> 01:41:33,841
Thank you sir.

1278
01:42:04,097 --> 01:42:06,460
Whatever might happen,
which ever decision Mythri might take...

1279
01:42:07,141 --> 01:42:08,653
...it's righteous to tell her the truth.

1280
01:42:19,636 --> 01:42:25,130
[phone ringing]

1281
01:42:25,330 --> 01:42:28,614
[phone ringing]

1282
01:42:31,681 --> 01:42:35,794
-Hello?
-Siddu, I need to talk to you.

1283
01:42:36,129 --> 01:42:36,921
Yeah, tell me Mythri.

1284
01:42:38,661 --> 01:42:40,870
-Shall we meet?
-Okay, where?

1285
01:42:41,754 --> 01:42:43,217
The place where we usually meet.

1286
01:42:44,934 --> 01:42:45,491
I am coming.

1287
01:44:47,555 --> 01:44:50,548
Mythri, what actually happened is...

1288
01:44:52,384 --> 01:44:53,092
[gasps]

1289
01:44:54,033 --> 01:44:55,782
[coughs]

1290
01:44:59,389 --> 01:45:02,776
[gasps]

1291
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:08,541
[crying] [gasping]

1292
01:45:17,936 --> 01:45:23,870
[music]

1293
01:45:31,494 --> 01:45:34,715
[phone ringing]

1294
01:45:35,745 --> 01:45:38,222
-Hello?
-Mythri meet me immediately.

1295
01:45:38,422 --> 01:45:40,885
-Sir now?
-Yeah, I'll share the location.

1296
01:45:41,085 --> 01:45:43,354
-Start right away
-Sir, anything urgent?

1297
01:45:43,554 --> 01:45:45,176
-Yes, it is
-Okay sir, I am coming.

1298
01:47:19,082 --> 01:47:23,896
Sir, why did you ask me to come suddenly?
Did you get any information?

1299
01:47:24,371 --> 01:47:27,132
Not information,
case almost came to the final stage.

1300
01:47:27,423 --> 01:47:28,446
Final stage means..

1301
01:47:31,669 --> 01:47:33,824
Who is behind Divya's suicide?

1302
01:47:35,307 --> 01:47:35,853
What's the reason?

1303
01:47:36,053 --> 01:47:39,395
There's only one reason for Mahalakshmi,
kalyani's suicides along with Divya's.

1304
01:47:39,595 --> 01:47:42,253
-What is it?
-Self recorded romance videos.

1305
01:47:42,453 --> 01:47:45,635
-What?
-Yes, self recorded romance videos.

1306
01:47:46,309 --> 01:47:49,617
Because one person got hold of
those videos and blackmailed them.

1307
01:47:50,613 --> 01:47:52,243
That guy blackmailed them for money.

1308
01:47:53,256 --> 01:47:55,134
Even after they gave him the
cash and got back the videos..

1309
01:47:56,033 --> 01:47:59,988
The mistake they've done for a little
fun went out in the form of videos..

1310
01:48:00,750 --> 01:48:03,608
...and they got scared they might lose
their honour and their family's respect

1311
01:48:03,808 --> 01:48:04,915
and committed suicide.

1312
01:48:06,155 --> 01:48:09,068
Any girl will give importance
to her honour than her life.

1313
01:48:09,661 --> 01:48:13,101
and that's exactly why,
Divya has committed suicide.

1314
01:48:15,250 --> 01:48:18,826
He called them three with different
voices through voice modulator app.

1315
01:48:20,328 --> 01:48:22,264
First he called, then he sent an MMS.

1316
01:48:22,853 --> 01:48:25,221
They went into a situation where they
don't know what to do in that shock...

1317
01:48:25,724 --> 01:48:27,739
...they can't be saying it to anyone.

1318
01:48:28,449 --> 01:48:30,998
Without another option
they did what he told.

1319
01:48:33,056 --> 01:48:36,311
They gave him the money he
asked and got their videos back.

1320
01:48:37,647 --> 01:48:38,959
When we checked Divya's and
Kalyani's bank accounts...

1321
01:48:39,565 --> 01:48:41,923
...we go to know that they
gave money to the blackmailer.

1322
01:48:42,635 --> 01:48:46,782
Mahalakshmi loaned the amount by
giving her gold chain to a borrower

1323
01:48:48,736 --> 01:48:51,547
Who is the reason behind Divya's death?

1324
01:48:51,747 --> 01:48:54,018
Yes, I am coming to the actual matter..

1325
01:48:54,919 --> 01:48:56,673
In your search of the person
behind your sister's death...

1326
01:48:56,850 --> 01:48:57,822
...you fell in love with him.

1327
01:48:59,913 --> 01:49:01,011
It's Siddu, whom you love.

1328
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,027
Divya came to Siddu's repair
shop as her phone got hanged.

1329
01:49:11,227 --> 01:49:12,818
[vehicle sounds]

1330
01:49:14,684 --> 01:49:17,818
In the process of repairing Divya's phone,
Siddu saw few videos.

1331
01:49:19,489 --> 01:49:22,317
and unknowingly,
few deleted videos also got recovered.

1332
01:49:29,017 --> 01:49:30,645
After Divya took her phone and went...

1333
01:50:44,443 --> 01:50:47,168
Siddu got thirsty for money
after watching Divya's videos.

1334
01:50:47,368 --> 01:50:51,837
He decided to call Divya
to get the money easily.

1335
01:50:55,540 --> 01:50:58,001
Not to get caught,
he downloaded few softwares...

1336
01:50:58,393 --> 01:51:00,206
...and called her with another number

1337
01:51:00,957 --> 01:51:04,455
He used voice modulator software for
escaping voice code identification.

1338
01:51:04,655 --> 01:51:08,515
He started using his technical
knowledge in a wrong way for the money.

1339
01:51:22,128 --> 01:51:28,094
[phone ringing]

1340
01:51:29,687 --> 01:51:30,144
Hello?

1341
01:51:30,344 --> 01:51:33,654
The romance you did with
your boyfriend is very nice.

1342
01:51:34,681 --> 01:51:39,654
I saw those just now,
selfi videos in HD quality are too good.

1343
01:51:41,179 --> 01:51:43,207
-If you want you can see
-What?

1344

[crying]

1348
01:51:57,877 --> 01:52:02,086
Hello? [laughs]

1349
01:52:03,745 --> 01:52:07,502
Without thinking about how did they come,
from where did they come..

1350
01:52:08,164 --> 01:52:10,364
..without telling this matter to anyone..

1351
01:52:12,137 --> 01:52:13,957
-Do as I say.
-Who are you?

1352
01:52:14,665 --> 01:52:18,334
You enjoyed with your boyfriend for
your happiness, you even took the videos

1353
01:52:19,061 --> 01:52:20,640
Even I should be happy too right?

1354
01:52:21,984 --> 01:52:23,716
For that I want 1 lakh.

1355
01:52:24,767 --> 01:52:28,208
Without using foolish things
like I don't have, I won't give..

1356
01:52:28,688 --> 01:52:29,889
...arrange the money.

1357
01:52:30,752 --> 01:52:32,804
I'll tell you when and where to bring.

1358
01:52:33,004 --> 01:52:34,210
[crying]

1359
01:52:34,967 --> 01:52:37,793
If not, your videos will become
viral all over the internet.

1360
01:52:38,456 --> 01:52:42,655
Look, I want money,
I don't want your videos.

1361
01:52:43,247 --> 01:52:46,559
So, without making the issue big,
arrange the money.

1362
01:52:47,345 --> 01:52:48,739
I think you're sharp enough.

1363
01:52:50,397 --> 01:52:52,792
Wait for my next call Miss Divya.

1364
01:52:53,851 --> 01:52:56,905
Please don't upload those videos,
family will lose respect.

1365
01:52:57,857 --> 01:52:59,392
Please delete those videos.

1366
01:53:00,841 --> 01:53:02,803
Please..hello?

1367
01:53:03,261 --> 01:53:06,267
Hello? hello? [crying]

1368
01:53:06,467 --> 01:53:12,426
[crying]

1369
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:25,252
Pick up the phone.

1370
01:53:25,452 --> 01:53:31,341

1371
01:53:34,428 --> 01:53:40,366

[camera clicks]

1373
01:53:43,576 --> 01:53:45,212
Divya didn't understand
what to do in tension.

1374
01:53:46,021 --> 01:53:48,334
She decided to take her videos from Siddu.

1375
01:53:49,691 --> 01:53:51,825
That's why she went to the place where
Siddu asked her to come with the money.

1376
01:53:57,387 --> 01:54:00,052
-1 lakh? everything's there?
-yes, it's there.

1377
01:54:04,894 --> 01:54:08,641
There will be a cover at the pillar,
keep it inside and leave immediately.

1378
01:54:09,057 --> 01:54:11,698
Then my videos? How should I trust you?

1379
01:54:12,475 --> 01:54:15,689
Do what I say, you don't have a choice.

1380
01:54:16,180 --> 01:54:17,337
I don't have any work with your videos.

1381
01:54:17,798 --> 01:54:19,706
By the time you place the
money and reach your house...

1382
01:54:19,906 --> 01:54:21,167
...the pen drive will be at your gate.

1383
01:54:21,923 --> 01:54:22,374
Quick

1384
01:54:28,843 --> 01:54:31,066
Yes, okay.

1385
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:22,015

1386
01:55:22,215 --> 01:55:28,185
[crying]

1387
01:55:39,896 --> 01:55:41,200
She's scared of her mistake..

1388
01:55:42,031 --> 01:55:45,227
..if her blackmailer
got more of her videos

1389
01:55:46,100 --> 01:55:48,887
and Divya was scared that he
might upload them to net..

1390
01:55:49,087 --> 01:55:50,831
and she called her boyfriend Anand.

1391
01:55:51,031 --> 01:55:52,031
He didn't respond.

1392
01:55:53,079 --> 01:55:56,704
Divya's fear doubled with the
breaking news that came on TV.

1393
01:56:02,522 --> 01:56:05,263
B.TECH STUDENT SWATHI'S
NUDE VIDEOS LEAKED ON NET

1394
01:56:15,384 --> 01:56:19,192
Guntur based B.tech student
Swathi committed suicide.

1395
01:56:19,392 --> 01:56:25,115
Her personal videos and nude videos
got released on social networking sites

1396
01:56:25,315 --> 01:56:28,076
Police are thinking that might
be the reason for her suicide.

1397
01:56:28,276 --> 01:56:29,801
She didn't understand whom
to share her pain with,

1398
01:56:30,590 --> 01:56:34,027
without knowing what to do,
she committed suicide.

1399
01:56:36,101 --> 01:56:37,065
[gasps]

1400
01:56:42,089 --> 01:56:47,276
[crying] Oh no!

1401
01:56:47,732 --> 01:56:49,717
Without knowing about Divya's suicide...

1402
01:56:50,124 --> 01:56:52,008
He started recovering every smartphone
data that came for repair to his shop..

1403
01:56:52,399 --> 01:56:57,221
He started recovering every smartphone
data that came for repair to his shop..

1404
01:56:58,795 --> 01:57:02,306
He got the videos in Kalyani and
Mahalakshmi's phones the same way.

1405
01:57:04,157 --> 01:57:06,200
He blackmailed them in the same method.

1406
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:09,234
Arrange for 1 lakh,
I'll tell you where to bring.

1407
01:57:09,434 --> 01:57:11,355
Hello? Hello?

1408
01:57:11,949 --> 01:57:13,985
He bought a bike with the money
he got from blackmailing Divya.

1409
01:57:14,185 --> 01:57:17,505
When the plan worked out,
he blackmailed Mahalakshmi aswell.

1410
01:57:19,018 --> 01:57:20,373
It's okay if a 5 or 10 is less..

1411
01:57:21,677 --> 01:57:25,270
...if you didn't come with the money to
the place I said by evening 5'O'clock..

1412
01:57:27,741 --> 01:57:28,431
It's your wish.

1413
01:57:29,723 --> 01:57:33,500
Videos of you enjoying with your secret
lover when your husband wasn't around

1414
01:57:33,700 --> 01:57:34,700
...will be forwarded.

1415
01:57:34,900 --> 01:57:39,005
I pray to you, My husband will
kill me if he knows about this..

1416
01:57:40,733 --> 01:57:43,380
I'll bring the money whereever
you want me to bring.

1417
01:57:44,581 --> 01:57:46,247
Please delete those videos.

1418
01:57:48,932 --> 01:57:49,325
Hello?

1419
01:57:51,081 --> 01:57:54,699
Mahalakshmi got depressed for cheating
on her husband..she couldn't face him..

1420
01:57:54,899 --> 01:57:57,226
can't dare to say, she committed
suicide after writing a letter

1421
01:57:59,477 --> 01:58:00,792
Without knowing all this, Siddu...

1422
01:58:00,992 --> 01:58:02,675
happily repaid his loans
with the money Kalyani gave...

1423
01:58:02,929 --> 01:58:04,688
...and enjoyed with the
money Mahalakshmi gave.

1424
01:58:06,922 --> 01:58:10,929
Even before he got to know about Divya's
suicide, he fell in love with you.

1425
01:58:12,262 --> 01:58:14,361
He won't get you if you know that he
is the reason behind Divya's death..

1426
01:58:14,816 --> 01:58:17,302
That's why he is by your side
and observed your every move.

1427
01:58:18,182 --> 01:58:19,235
and got on without getting caught.

1428
01:58:23,791 --> 01:58:26,980
Infact, if he takes away the details
I got in this investigation...

1429
01:58:27,942 --> 01:58:30,377
..he thought foolishly that this
case will be closed without clues..

1430
01:58:30,777 --> 01:58:33,288
..and came for robbing my
house but escaped thinly.

1431
01:58:36,879 --> 01:58:38,890
Even if I have a doubt that it
was Siddu who came for robbing..

1432
01:58:39,620 --> 01:58:42,547
I decided that it's him after
finishing my whole enquiry.

1433
01:58:43,611 --> 01:58:46,585
That's why I searched for more clues,
but it was difficult..

1434
01:58:47,084 --> 01:58:51,007
Because Siddu executed this
whole matter very planned.

1435
01:58:52,736 --> 01:58:56,392
But, the small clue we got is the
CC tv footage in Siddu's shop.

1436
01:58:56,592 --> 01:58:59,846
We found the visuals of Divya,
Mahalakshmi and Kalyani in it.

1437
01:59:00,447 --> 01:59:04,390
That's when we got doubt on Siddu,
Yadav and his shop owner.

1438
01:59:05,815 --> 01:59:10,671
To check that we called them for enquiry,
recorded their voices and statements..

1439
01:59:10,871 --> 01:59:12,416
and sent them to lab for voice match..

1440
01:59:22,092 --> 01:59:23,747
The blackmailer voice
recorded in phone and

1441
01:59:23,947 --> 01:59:27,664
Siddu's voice in the recorded
enquiry has a common factor.

1442
01:59:27,864 --> 01:59:29,672
Clues team expert Viswam said that.

1443
01:59:29,872 --> 01:59:30,961
What's that?

1444
01:59:31,890 --> 01:59:33,789
The three voices recorded in
the phone belongs to one person.

1445
01:59:34,416 --> 01:59:36,194
How can you tell that confidently
that it belongs to the same person?

1446
01:59:36,394 --> 01:59:37,394
I'll explain you.

1447
01:59:38,545 --> 01:59:43,252
If we're in normal state of mind, we'll
think and speak steadily and clearly.

1448
01:59:44,576 --> 01:59:45,297
But if we are talking in anger,

1449
01:59:45,775 --> 01:59:49,708
in a hurry or in tension,
our words will stumble.

1450
01:59:49,908 --> 01:59:51,742
We can't pronounce few letters clearly.

1451
01:59:52,707 --> 01:59:56,725
When I observed closely, the person
who spoke in these three phone calls..

1452
01:59:56,925 --> 02:00:02,242
..as it is unplanned and he is
in tension..he pronounced L as K

1453
02:00:02,716 --> 02:00:04,858
We'll know if we listen to it
with complete concentration.

1454
02:00:06,929 --> 02:00:10,252
It is very clearly found in Siddu's
investigation recorded voice.

1455
02:00:11,390 --> 02:00:12,412
-Thank you sir.
-Welcome.

1456
02:00:17,597 --> 02:00:18,842
With the evidence professor gave...

1457
02:00:19,042 --> 02:00:21,092
it's confirmed that Siddu
is behind those three deaths

1458
02:00:22,067 --> 02:00:27,464
But to check it personally,
I went Siddu's cell service centre.

1459
02:00:46,820 --> 02:00:50,042
Why did you come sir?
Stik..still you are doubting me?

1460
02:00:51,929 --> 02:00:54,176
Sir,
I would've come if you called me no sir?

1461
02:00:54,376 --> 02:00:55,761
Stik..still you are doubting me?

1462
02:00:58,883 --> 02:01:04,394
No more doubts Siddu,
I came just like that. We'll meet again.

1463
02:01:16,733 --> 02:01:19,372
If cellphone is in the hand,
so many people in the society thinking

1464
02:01:19,572 --> 02:01:23,313
that the whole world is in
their hands and misusing it

1465
02:01:23,513 --> 02:01:24,894
instead of using it as
a communication device

1466
02:01:26,384 --> 02:01:27,604
Starting with fun selfies...

1467
02:01:27,804 --> 02:01:30,583
they are shooting
personal romance videos in the phone.

1468
02:01:32,254 --> 02:01:34,453
They are thinking whole
world is in their hands but..

1469
02:01:35,247 --> 02:01:37,930
...they don't know they are
stuck in the hands of whole world

1470
02:01:39,058 --> 02:01:40,616
One time, just one time..

1471
02:01:41,305 --> 02:01:44,376
If our phone falls in the hands of
opportunists, or selfish people..

1472
02:01:45,125 --> 02:01:51,115
What's our situation if they recover
our recorded videos, photos, selfies?

1473
02:01:53,694 --> 02:01:58,242
Life has to end abruptly like Divya,
Mahalakshmi and Kalyani's lives

1474
02:01:58,442 --> 02:02:00,399
Will be caught in the hands
of criminals like Siddu

1475
02:02:00,599 --> 02:02:06,594
[crying] Siddu!

1476
02:02:07,694 --> 02:02:13,654
[crying] Siddu!

1477
02:02:13,854 --> 02:02:17,434
[gun fires]

1478
02:02:17,634 --> 02:02:21,172
[gasps]

1479
02:02:21,372 --> 02:02:24,054
[crying]

1480
02:02:29,788 --> 02:02:35,744
[crying]

1481
02:02:57,543 --> 02:03:03,519
[crying]

1482
02:03:25,964 --> 02:03:30,825
Lives of persons who choose wrong path
for easy money'll surely end like this.

1483
02:03:36,552 --> 02:03:37,769
I know that I am doing mistake but..

1484
02:03:38,894 --> 02:03:42,695
...I don't know that mistake is
big enough to take someone's life.

1485
02:03:46,904 --> 02:03:50,158
I lost my love due to that mistake.

1486
02:03:51,134 --> 02:03:53,735
[coughs]

1487
02:03:54,847 --> 02:03:58,145
Now, life too.

1488
02:04:02,095 --> 02:04:06,259
[laughs]

1489
02:04:06,997 --> 02:04:11,664
No one is responsible for my death,
it's me.

1490
02:04:30,575 --> 02:04:35,542
-Sir, Siddu is done
-Sad, I can't help it.

1491
02:04:36,433 --> 02:04:39,252
Come to office, more cases are there.
