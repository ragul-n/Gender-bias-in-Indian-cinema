[TAMIL DIALOGUES]

2
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,387
Where’s the ICU?

3
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:37,340
Where the hell is the ICU?

4
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,817
This man, who’s running
with no care for the world…

5
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,434
has a story to tell.

6
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:49,050
Let’s go back a few years.

7
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,326
Hey! For our friendship!
Cheers!

8
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:13,021
Did you call me?

9
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,795
Have it.
- What’s this?

10
00:05:14,826 --> 00:05:16,303
Just taste it, please.

11
00:05:16,514 --> 00:05:17,732
Umm… okay.

12
00:05:17,787 --> 00:05:19,841
Only one, alright?
- Yeah. Yeah.

13
00:05:25,685 --> 00:05:26,771
Tastes like glycerin.

14
00:05:27,107 --> 00:05:28,154
Not bad.

15
00:05:29,615 --> 00:05:30,271
No.

16
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:32,139
Please...Please.

17
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:52,810
What the hell!

18
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,107
Aren’t you satisfied with one guy?

19
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,662
Mind your tongue!
- Mind your business!

20
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:57,302
Girls are you like so desperate.

21
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:59,295
You go through 2-3 guys in a day
You bloody bitch!

22
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,185
Let me talk...
We’ll talk, girls.

23
00:06:06,748 --> 00:06:07,396
Yes!

24
00:06:12,326 --> 00:06:14,428
[singing randomly]

25
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,287
Hey!! Excuse me.

26
00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:33,685
[indistinct screaming]

27
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:49,139
You’re so beautiful!

28
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,131
I know that.

29
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:52,201
What? Aren’t you going to
thank me for the compliment?

30
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,560
If you expect a thanks,

31
00:06:54,537 --> 00:06:59,646
The whole point of a compliment is lost.

32
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,068
Ooh!!

33
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:04,482
Flirting, huh?

34
00:07:04,553 --> 00:07:06,240
No. Love!

35
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,732
Ah! But we just met.

36
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:10,639
Think of it as love at first sight.

37
00:07:10,951 --> 00:07:13,779
True love happens over time.

38
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,818
What if there’s no time at hand?

39
00:07:15,873 --> 00:07:19,193
Like you said, if it’s true love…

40
00:07:19,623 --> 00:07:21,560
Nobody can escape from it.

41
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,756
I’m clear. My love is true.

42
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,076
In that case, time will find you.

43
00:07:26,201 --> 00:07:27,826
You know something?

44
00:07:28,145 --> 00:07:32,099
If you experience true
love even just for a second…

45
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,240
You feel the joy for a lifetime.

46
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:39,295
I’m ready to shower my love for a lifetime.

47
00:07:39,365 --> 00:07:40,295
I’m K.

48
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,218
Yeah, okay.

49
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,233
I said I’m K. Karthik.

50
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:45,265
Oh!

51
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,788
I’m U.

52
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:48,764
I know you’re mine.

53
00:07:48,881 --> 00:07:51,709
No. I’m U. Uma.

54
00:07:54,217 --> 00:07:56,373
Ah! I’ve decided.
- What?

55
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:58,202
You’re mine!

56
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,858
Oi! Don’t just walk away with a smile.

57
00:08:04,343 --> 00:08:04,991
Hi.

58
00:08:16,397 --> 00:08:18,163
I made a mistake, Lord.

59
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,108
I almost fell for a guy
at the pub last night.

60
00:08:23,218 --> 00:08:24,334
You mean?

61
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:27,585
Like, I made him feel that there’s hope.

62
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:29,623
Do you regret doing that now?
- Of course.

63
00:08:29,936 --> 00:08:32,929
I can’t fall in love with
a stranger at the pub.

64
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:34,515
Where was this sense last night?

65
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:38,226
You know… I was high.

66
00:08:38,265 --> 00:08:41,311
Don’t tell me you got drunk.
- I was just going to taste it.

67
00:08:41,436 --> 00:08:43,084
But it tasted nice,
kind of like glycerin.

68
00:08:43,663 --> 00:08:46,421
So, I had a few drinks.

69
00:08:46,796 --> 00:08:49,632
I guess I liked him ‘cause I was high.

70
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:52,749
Didn’t it feel wrong, getting drunk?

71
00:08:52,921 --> 00:08:55,960
Lord, if I got drunk, it’s
going to affect me only.

72
00:08:56,272 --> 00:08:58,272
So, it didn’t feel wrong.

73
00:08:58,397 --> 00:09:01,349
But, I’m afraid it’s
going to affect him now.

74
00:09:01,527 --> 00:09:03,535
So, now it’s starting to feel wrong.

75
00:09:03,683 --> 00:09:07,035
Strange! People never fail to surprise God.

76
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,183
What’s your problem, Uma?

77
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:14,215
I don’t remember his face ‘cause
I saw him under the pub lights.

78
00:09:14,261 --> 00:09:16,433
So, there’s no problem
even if I bump into him.

79
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:20,175
But, make sure he
doesn’t bump into me, Lord.

80
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,191
Alright. I’ll try my best.

81
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:23,785
Rest is up to God.

82
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:26,332
Big deal. This is nothing.

83
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:29,421
Even a girl gets scared
to shop with another girl.

84
00:09:29,632 --> 00:09:32,553
You’re a guy. On top of
that, you’re handsome.

85
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,100
I’m so excited that you’re
going shopping with me.

86
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,530
Should I double your excitement?

87
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,303
What?!

88
00:09:50,811 --> 00:09:54,882
Karthik, you go to admit
that you’re high maintenance.

89
00:09:54,975 --> 00:09:57,163
Obviously. It’s my profession.

90
00:09:57,491 --> 00:09:59,913
It’s a lot of work to get a bride ready.

91
00:09:59,938 --> 00:10:02,748
It’s easy actually
What’s the big deal?

92
00:10:02,773 --> 00:10:06,147
Western gown for the Sangeet
Lehenga for the Mehendi function.

93
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,678
Half saree for one ritual
Designer saree for the bridal ritual.

94
00:10:08,703 --> 00:10:11,530
Silk saree for the wedding day
Traditional saree for the prayer day.

95
00:10:11,573 --> 00:10:13,542
Ghagra for the reception
Chudidaars for other events.

96
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:17,854
Like that’s not too much
pre-wedding shoots are a trend now.

97
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:20,479
They wear denims, gowns, Banaras
sarees, anarkalis, pajamas and patialas.

98
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,042
Matching blouses, dupattas,
embroideries and designs.

99
00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:26,823
Karthik, let’s get out of here, please.

100
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,440
I’m in love with your taste.

101
00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:29,135
No, Asha.

102
00:10:30,323 --> 00:10:32,604
Look. It’s just infatuation.

103
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:34,635
Trust me. You’ll get over this.

104
00:10:34,745 --> 00:10:38,447
Aww! You’re just making
me fall even harder.

105
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:40,674
What the hell! I should do something.

106
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:46,331
Asha, police are patrolling.

107
00:10:46,385 --> 00:10:48,088
You can’t get caught at this hour.

108
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:52,354
Get going
We’ll talk later.

109
00:10:52,502 --> 00:10:56,711
Okay? Go. Here, Go!
- No, please!

110
00:10:59,103 --> 00:11:00,071
Thank god!

111
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,391
Hey, Meera! Doctor isn't here yet, is he?

112
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,540
Why do you look low?
What's wrong?

113
00:11:07,063 --> 00:11:08,540
Hey, Priya!

114
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,265
What happened?

115
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:18,812
Her fiance is getting her an unofficial
virgin test without her knowledge.

116
00:11:27,288 --> 00:11:28,648
Where are you going?

117
00:11:28,765 --> 00:11:31,600
You're not thinking straight
We don't want to get into this, Let's go.

118
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:33,968
I can tolerate a mistake from my side.

119
00:11:34,242 --> 00:11:36,686
But, I can't watch somebody make one.

120
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:46,546
Excuse me, Where's your fiance?

121
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:49,523
She never listens.

122
00:11:49,984 --> 00:11:51,460
I'm her fiance. What is it?

123
00:11:51,773 --> 00:11:54,984
Oh. So you're the macho man
who's getting her a virgin test.

124
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:56,626
Uma! You're losing it.

125
00:11:58,007 --> 00:12:00,015
You're after all a house surgeon.

126
00:12:00,335 --> 00:12:01,757
Be within your limits.

127
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:05,147
Yes, I'm after all a house surgeon.

128
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:07,179
But, you're a certified doctor, right?

129
00:12:07,288 --> 00:12:08,499
He's ignorant.

130
00:12:08,843 --> 00:12:13,507
But, as a doctor...
don't you know such a test doesn't exist?

131
00:12:14,585 --> 00:12:15,648
Damn it!

132
00:12:23,694 --> 00:12:25,452
If something like this happens...

133
00:12:25,507 --> 00:12:27,538
you assume that she's not a virgin.

134
00:12:27,835 --> 00:12:28,374
Am I right?

135
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,522
You're not alone.

136
00:12:29,593 --> 00:12:32,249
Many people make the same assumption.

137
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:36,273
This is the truth every man needs to know.

138
00:12:36,445 --> 00:12:39,929
This thing you're seeing is called hymen.

139
00:12:40,109 --> 00:12:41,468
It's a mucus cell tissue.

140
00:12:41,608 --> 00:12:44,069
For some, the
stretchability is comfortable.

141
00:12:44,273 --> 00:12:45,945
While for some, it's absent.

142
00:12:46,523 --> 00:12:48,320
Due to lack of stretchability...

143
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:52,678
even a little pressure could
make the hymen bleed.

144
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:55,304
That's what you all call virginity.

145
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:58,780
Mrs. Marie Jeancet
First Norwegian Lady Doctor.

146
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:00,078
In 1906...

147
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:03,882
She conducted the virginity test for
the first time on a middle aged prostitute.

148
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:05,695
And that lady was declared a virgin.

149
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:09,427
But, according to you, a
prostitute can't be a virgin, right?

150
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:14,466
There's no test in the world
that can prove a girl's virginity.

151
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:18,076
Moreover, virginity isn't
something to do with the body.

152
00:13:21,745 --> 00:13:23,284
It's a matter of the heart.

153
00:13:28,284 --> 00:13:30,838
Wow! well said, Love you!

154
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,111
No man will ever bring
up a girl's virgnity again.

155
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,737
Whoa! I totally forgot
You're going out of town, right?

156
00:13:36,776 --> 00:13:39,307
Oops! I actually came to get permission.

157
00:13:39,377 --> 00:13:40,432
Bye. Bye.

158
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:01,525
Ph.D, Not my qualification.

159
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:02,604
It's my name.

160
00:14:02,846 --> 00:14:04,346
Pathuri Hanumantha Das.

161
00:14:04,673 --> 00:14:06,243
I don't want to waste energy.

162
00:14:06,424 --> 00:14:07,736
So, I call myself Ph.D in short.

163
00:14:07,955 --> 00:14:09,854
It's also my qualification
Sorry.

164
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,775
I'm doing a Ph.D on Indian relationships.

165
00:14:14,268 --> 00:14:16,815
Uma, House Surgeon
Pediatrician.

166
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:19,806
Pediatrician? Children's specialist, huh?

167
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,259
Very interesting job!

168
00:14:21,752 --> 00:14:25,377
As you put a needle in a baby's bum...

169
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,900
it feels so good, eh?

170
00:14:28,486 --> 00:14:30,759
I heard that you've got a large family.

171
00:14:31,775 --> 00:14:35,330
In fact, that's one of the
reasons I agreed to this marriage.

172
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,182
It will help with my thesis.

173
00:14:40,658 --> 00:14:41,744
Interesting, huh?

174
00:14:42,086 --> 00:14:44,781
Attending our engagement together
Sounds new, I know.

175
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,929
Okay, tell me about your family
So that I don't get bored.

176
00:14:48,258 --> 00:14:49,711
[chanting]

177
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,180
Is this your entire colony?

178
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,265
No son, That's our family.

179
00:15:06,648 --> 00:15:07,781
We're a joint family.

180
00:15:07,945 --> 00:15:10,624
Oh, is it, uncle?
- Call me father-in-law.

181
00:15:10,663 --> 00:15:13,359
But, uncle works, right?
- No. Father-in-law is more affectionate.

182
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:14,312
Oh.

183
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,594
It can be confusing.

184
00:15:16,648 --> 00:15:18,577
No, son
Can't get any clear than this.

185
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:20,672
He's your father-in-law.

186
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,819
Aww! Such a show off!

187
00:15:25,765 --> 00:15:28,351
You're jealous of my beauty, old woman!

188
00:15:29,913 --> 00:15:31,601
I may be old now.

189
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,437
But, I was a hottie at one point of time.

190
00:15:34,554 --> 00:15:35,577
I know.

191
00:15:35,663 --> 00:15:39,045
I'm sure you were a home wrecker.

192
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,670
Hey! Get the old woman out.

193
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,288
Uma...
- Yes, mom?

194
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:52,679
Uma, introduce him to everyone.

195
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,530
No need, She told me already.

196
00:15:54,616 --> 00:15:55,944
Want to test my memory?

197
00:15:55,983 --> 00:15:56,796
Please move.

198
00:15:56,858 --> 00:15:58,843
This is Uma's grandma.

199
00:15:59,851 --> 00:16:02,303
She's always coughing
And blessing you.

200
00:16:02,358 --> 00:16:04,811
I'm kind of shy
I'm fine here.

201
00:16:06,187 --> 00:16:07,968
Oh, no.
- It's okay.

202
00:16:08,693 --> 00:16:11,561
This is Uma's uncle
Soumitri. His wife Savitri.

203
00:16:11,586 --> 00:16:13,694
No. It's Gayatri.
- Whatever.

204
00:16:19,034 --> 00:16:19,823
Take care.

205
00:16:21,558 --> 00:16:23,652
I want to introduce another
very important person.

206
00:16:23,761 --> 00:16:25,636
Don't be so shy
Come on out.

207
00:16:26,183 --> 00:16:28,846
This is my grandpa
Name is Melkovayya.

208
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,440
It's not Melkovayya
It's Melkotayya.

209
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:34,878
Lag your name anymore and
the engagement will be over.

210
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,776
This is...
- Why did you stop?

211
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:46,956
We reached your place
by the time we got to her That's why.

212
00:16:47,636 --> 00:16:49,425
My sister Sumana and my uncle Mohan.

213
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,370
Isn't he supposed to
be your brother-in-law?

214
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:53,464
Why do you call him uncle?

215
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:56,135
He's my mom's brother
That makes him my uncle first.

216
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,057
Ah! So, if girls can marry
their mom's brother...

217
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,745
Can guys marry their dad's sister?
- No...No...

218
00:17:02,816 --> 00:17:03,636
Why?

219
00:17:04,175 --> 00:17:06,823
I don't know why
But, it doesn't happen. That's it.

220
00:17:07,214 --> 00:17:09,495
So, what if the girl is elder?

221
00:17:09,534 --> 00:17:11,323
Problem comes with awareness.

222
00:17:11,808 --> 00:17:14,495
Girls are way more matured than guys.

223
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:18,089
When you marry a girl younger
to you, there's no generation gap.

224
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,011
Makes sense, father-in-law.

225
00:17:20,175 --> 00:17:22,393
Sir, take the rings placed at
Lord Rama's feet and put them on.

226
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,472
Yeah, sure.

227
00:17:25,675 --> 00:17:28,378
What are you doing?
- I thought he wanted me to clean them.

228
00:17:28,403 --> 00:17:31,612
No, He asked you to put them on.

229
00:17:31,637 --> 00:17:33,104
Yeah, whatever.

230
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:44,441
Hey, stop! I said stop!

231
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:51,050
Someone seems to be blushing.

232
00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:54,808
Whoever got married in our family...

233
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:57,534
you'd be the junior bride
when you were a kid.

234
00:17:58,073 --> 00:18:02,682
And then you'd go,
'When will I get married?'

235
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,292
I can't believe you grew up so quickly.

236
00:18:06,441 --> 00:18:07,839
You're getting married already.

237
00:18:08,902 --> 00:18:11,097
Thank god it's finally happening.

238
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:12,784
Shut up, you silly girl!

239
00:18:14,855 --> 00:18:15,933
My jeans!

240
00:18:16,222 --> 00:18:18,597
Why are you packing all sarees, mom?

241
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:20,800
I'm not packing just your clothes.

242
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:24,597
It's your responsibilities as well.

243
00:18:26,034 --> 00:18:30,299
Listen, dear. A man views a woman
according to the way she dresses.

244
00:18:31,386 --> 00:18:34,003
When you were little,
you'd only have a diaper on.

245
00:18:34,307 --> 00:18:35,823
That's okay 'cause you were a kid.

246
00:18:36,495 --> 00:18:39,198
When you started growing up,
you stopped wearing short frocks.

247
00:18:40,112 --> 00:18:41,902
That's 'cause you were becoming a lady.

248
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:45,534
When you get married,
you should look dignified.

249
00:18:46,456 --> 00:18:49,745
And that comes with a saree only.
- Mom, please!

250
00:18:50,027 --> 00:18:51,823
My wedding isn't until a while now.

251
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:54,597
Please pack these also.

252
00:18:54,722 --> 00:18:58,573
Okay. I'll pack 2 jeans for you.
- Hmm. Okay.

253
00:18:58,652 --> 00:18:59,566
Get ready quickly.

254
00:18:59,698 --> 00:19:01,995
Son-in-law is waiting for you.
- Okay.

255
00:19:20,182 --> 00:19:24,237
Your Honor, when someones
initiates something good...

256
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:26,893
many people try to come in the way of it.

257
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,464
That's what happened
to my client Phani Bhupal.

258
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,417
He wanted to educate by
society by investing millions.

259
00:19:35,612 --> 00:19:40,214
But the Prosecution has sent a stay
order saying he can't market his product.

260
00:19:40,745 --> 00:19:41,901
I object, Your Honor.

261
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:44,034
Defense Lawyer is diverting the topic.

262
00:19:44,628 --> 00:19:47,096
He's calling it a good deed?
A great intention?

263
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,104
Let's hear from him what the product is.

264
00:19:50,182 --> 00:19:50,948
Condom!

265
00:20:12,706 --> 00:20:13,854
Order! Order!

266
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:15,065
Hear that, Your Honor.

267
00:20:15,198 --> 00:20:18,526
The product made everybody crack up.

268
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:21,581
If this ad plays in the theatres...

269
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,479
forget about Mr. Phani here.

270
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,401
People will bash us for approving it.

271
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,619
Mr. Phani, is it true that you cast
prostitutes as models in all your ads?

272
00:20:31,651 --> 00:20:32,995
Objection, Your Honor.

273
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:38,151
Public Prosecutor seems to be
interested in unnecessary topics.

274
00:20:38,284 --> 00:20:39,995
You can refuse to answer if you want to.

275
00:20:40,331 --> 00:20:42,729
I feel only they can do justice to my ads.

276
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:45,253
That is why I cast them as models.

277
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:49,425
Your Honor, you promote the
warnings against smoking and drinking.

278
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:51,096
You place huge billboards.

279
00:20:51,346 --> 00:20:51,932
Nice.

280
00:20:52,229 --> 00:20:55,518
You can preach
But, can you stop the public?

281
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,112
Unsafe sex.

282
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,416
You promote awareness about the
spread of HIV and AIDS due to unsafe sex.

283
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:06,643
That's good.

284
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:12,432
Again, you can preach.
But, can you stop the public?

285
00:21:13,995 --> 00:21:16,417
When words don't work,
we should give a solution.

286
00:21:16,698 --> 00:21:18,385
My condoms are the solution.

287
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:21,784
Your Honor, Mr. Phani is
diverting the topic smartly.

288
00:21:22,518 --> 00:21:24,557
Mr. Murthy, how many kids do you have?

289
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:26,167
Why do you care?
- It's okay. Tell me.

290
00:21:26,932 --> 00:21:27,589
Two kids.

291
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,229
How old?

292
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,557
Son is 20
Daughter is 17.

293
00:21:32,635 --> 00:21:35,487
In those 3 years...

294
00:21:36,346 --> 00:21:38,940
What are you implying, sir?
- Did you use a condom or not?

295
00:21:42,198 --> 00:21:43,042
He's screwed!

296
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:45,440
Umm... Of course, I used it.

297
00:21:45,526 --> 00:21:46,502
That's all, Your Honor.

298
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:49,550
Condoms have become
a part of our daily lives.

299
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:56,330
What's wrong in educating
public about it in theatres?

300
00:21:56,487 --> 00:21:57,229
Yes!

301
00:21:57,495 --> 00:22:00,565
When you permit petty
common cold tablet ads...

302
00:22:00,831 --> 00:22:04,362
Why don't you approve condoms
that prevent the incurable AIDS?

303
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:06,925
Order!..

304
00:22:06,979 --> 00:22:10,580
The next hearing will be
on the 26th of next month.

305
00:22:12,901 --> 00:22:14,096
Are you Mr. Phani?
- Yeah.

306
00:22:14,151 --> 00:22:16,510
Can we talk personally for 2 minutes?
- Me?

307
00:22:16,603 --> 00:22:17,205
Please.

308
00:22:19,518 --> 00:22:23,526
You're on fire,
both in marketing and utilizing condoms.

309
00:22:24,003 --> 00:22:26,464
I've fixed a specific
rate for each photograph.

310
00:22:26,635 --> 00:22:28,612
Let's crack a deal and I'll be out.

311
00:22:59,926 --> 00:23:00,691
Knock him down.

312
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:24,253
Dad!...

313
00:23:25,007 --> 00:23:26,819
Usually, father receives
complaints on his son.

314
00:23:26,844 --> 00:23:28,131
It's the other way around with us.
- Ah! Two are remaining again.

315
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:31,827
You're behaving all romantic at this age.

316
00:23:31,866 --> 00:23:33,507
Someday, I'll make sure only one remains.

317
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,312
He'll never listen.

318
00:23:37,843 --> 00:23:38,937
What's this?

319
00:23:40,398 --> 00:23:41,882
Marbles game. Brainvita.

320
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:45,132
I'm talking about this adult game.

321
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,882
Again, you're not acting your age at all.

322
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:48,710
Let him eat peacefully.

323
00:23:48,735 --> 00:23:50,564
He might just grab a kiss if I pause.

324
00:23:50,664 --> 00:23:51,406
A kiss or two.

325
00:23:52,117 --> 00:23:53,734
Don't tell me how to deal with him.

326
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:55,374
Why weren't you guys looking after him?

327
00:23:55,406 --> 00:23:57,226
Hello, My job is to look after you.

328
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,468
Uncle is Tinku's responsibility.

329
00:23:59,734 --> 00:24:01,499
I called you in time for help, didn't I?

330
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:03,210
I don't get what's my fault.

331
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:05,429
I'm trying to find a nice mother for you.

332
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:07,718
You've been trying since I was a kid
You didn't find anyone.

333
00:24:07,937 --> 00:24:09,382
Moreover, is this how you do it?

334
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,468
I found some and missed some.

335
00:24:11,734 --> 00:24:12,742
Not my fault.

336
00:24:19,476 --> 00:24:21,289
I want to keep everybody happy.

337
00:24:21,382 --> 00:24:23,257
You feed the hungry.

338
00:24:23,507 --> 00:24:24,726
Help the needy.

339
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:27,382
Satisfy women when they ask for it.

340
00:24:27,686 --> 00:24:30,116
It's a sin not to.

341
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:32,210
Sin, huh?
- Right.

342
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,578
You can turn around, Tommy.

343
00:24:57,406 --> 00:24:59,343
What's up, Tommy?
- Tell me a story, Jerry.

344
00:24:59,851 --> 00:25:01,101
Story, huh?
- Hmm.

345
00:25:02,476 --> 00:25:03,789
There lived a King.

346
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,968
He had 14 sons.

347
00:25:06,828 --> 00:25:10,093
They all went fishing
together and brought 14 fish.

348
00:25:10,531 --> 00:25:12,515
Only one of those fish didn't dry.

349
00:25:13,171 --> 00:25:15,359
He asked, 'Hey, fish. Why didn't you dry?'

350
00:25:16,132 --> 00:25:18,726
Fish said, 'I came
across a beautiful moon'.

351
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,257
Ma'am... Ma'am!

352
00:25:32,703 --> 00:25:35,523
Ma'am, let's have breakfast.
- I already did.

353
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,835
Coffee, maybe?
- Had it.

354
00:25:38,476 --> 00:25:40,382
At least, fruits?
- I'm not hungry.

355
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:43,632
Let's have water then.
- Please. I have some work, okay?

356
00:25:53,124 --> 00:25:57,007
Listen, dear. A man views a woman
according to the way she dresses.

357
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,878
Anything happened?

358
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:09,457
5 deliveries. 3 baby girls. 2 baby boys.

359
00:26:11,699 --> 00:26:14,698
I'm already frustrated
I might stab you anywhere.

360
00:26:14,738 --> 00:26:16,324
Tell me clearly.
- Doctor!

361
00:26:18,488 --> 00:26:19,035
Go!

362
00:26:22,658 --> 00:26:23,627
Doctor...

363
00:26:23,652 --> 00:26:24,496
What do you need?

364
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,339
You're already late
And you have demands?

365
00:26:27,714 --> 00:26:28,347
Go!

366
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:33,277
[singing randomly]

367
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:39,387
Hey, Priya! I asked you what
happened and you're busy singing?

368
00:26:39,752 --> 00:26:42,354
You're jealous of my beauty.

369
00:26:43,361 --> 00:26:48,366
Now do you get how suffocating
it is when guys don't look at us.

370
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:52,372
Uma got engaged, you know.

371
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:57,434
Uma got engaged, you know...

372
00:26:57,552 --> 00:27:01,043
Do you realize how frustratingit is
to be friends with a beautiful girl?

373
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:03,349
Guys looked at you and
ignored me this whole time.

374
00:27:03,474 --> 00:27:07,216
From now on, they'll
look at me and ignore you.

375
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:10,504
Hello! I'm just as beautiful.

376
00:27:11,223 --> 00:27:12,817
Guys don't care about all that.

377
00:27:12,896 --> 00:27:14,958
The first two things they
notice about a girl are...

378
00:27:15,013 --> 00:27:17,762
One, on top. Two, down there.

379
00:27:17,786 --> 00:27:19,716
Yeww! What are you saying?

380
00:27:19,856 --> 00:27:23,185
I meant, they check whether you're
wearing a holy thread or toe rings.

381
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,981
Right now, I'm wearing neither.

382
00:27:28,692 --> 00:27:30,708
But, you've got a ring on your finger.

383
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:33,052
This isn't over
I can't wait for Sangeet.

384
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:45,841
Uma...

385
00:27:46,396 --> 00:27:48,763
Ask someone to get him something to eat.

386
00:27:48,856 --> 00:27:51,638
He might just eat me up with his glances.

387
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:53,887
Whenever they come
across a beautiful girl...

388
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,536
they stare at her like
they're going to eat her up.

389
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:56,856
I understand your pain.

390
00:27:56,919 --> 00:27:58,278
But, don't worry.

391
00:27:58,396 --> 00:28:00,856
Guys may not look at you anymore
But, uncles will. Look.

392
00:28:06,505 --> 00:28:07,255
Oh, no!

393
00:28:10,052 --> 00:28:10,598
Stop it!

394
00:28:10,903 --> 00:28:11,458
Wow!

395
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:15,474
I didn't know it feels so good when
your beautiful friend gets engaged.

396
00:28:27,387 --> 00:28:29,441
I've seen her somewhere.

397
00:28:29,598 --> 00:28:32,106
'Virginity isn't something
to do with the body.'

398
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,621
Strong girl!

399
00:28:33,786 --> 00:28:34,981
Strong girl!

400
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,551
Hey! You're a virgin, right?

401
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:47,340
What?!

402
00:28:48,176 --> 00:28:50,075
I mean, I saw your video.

403
00:28:50,176 --> 00:28:52,020
Hospital... Virgin...

404
00:28:53,582 --> 00:28:55,551
Yeah, right!

405
00:28:55,676 --> 00:28:57,090
That video was fab.

406
00:28:57,379 --> 00:28:59,004
Thank you!

407
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,973
Well, what's your name?

408
00:29:04,856 --> 00:29:05,770
Your name?

409
00:29:07,653 --> 00:29:08,817
Karthik.
- Karthik.

410
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:13,317
Karthik! Wow! What a nice name, man!

411
00:29:14,778 --> 00:29:15,621
And yours?

412
00:29:15,707 --> 00:29:18,020
Umm... My name is Uma.

413
00:29:18,045 --> 00:29:19,084
Oh. Uma.

414
00:29:19,598 --> 00:29:21,059
Can we take a selfie?

415
00:29:28,489 --> 00:29:31,145
Karthik! What are you doing over there?

416
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:32,176
Come here.

417
00:29:34,426 --> 00:29:35,473
Come...Come.

418
00:29:37,301 --> 00:29:38,067
Sorry.

419
00:29:38,668 --> 00:29:39,512
This is Karthik.

420
00:29:39,934 --> 00:29:41,528
He's the guy who groomed you.

421
00:29:41,723 --> 00:29:42,816
I'm looking good, right?

422
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:45,941
He's also the guy who
designed this whole event.

423
00:29:46,183 --> 00:29:47,230
Isn't that right, Karthik?

424
00:29:47,395 --> 00:29:49,637
Come on, Asha
It's okay, It's my job.

425
00:29:49,739 --> 00:29:50,809
Good evening, everyone.

426
00:29:50,903 --> 00:29:53,949
Now that all the guests have arrived...
we're going to being the Sangeet.

427
00:29:53,989 --> 00:29:55,308
Just a minute, dear.

428
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,332
If two people wish to
be together forever...

429
00:29:59,357 --> 00:30:00,840
they need to like each other.

430
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,735
But if two people don't want to break up...

431
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:05,439
They need to make sure
jealousy doesn't come in the way.

432
00:30:05,712 --> 00:30:07,478
Follow this one principle...

433
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:09,626
and every relation unfolds
beautifully with time.

434
00:30:09,744 --> 00:30:12,540
"She was jealous of Lord Rama"

435
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:15,181
"She wanted her blood son to be the King"

436
00:30:15,236 --> 00:30:17,759
"Kaika thus became
the villain of the story"

437
00:30:17,806 --> 00:30:22,993
"Jealousy is dangerous for your health"

438
00:30:23,018 --> 00:30:25,384
"Damn, he's the jealous type"

439
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:28,204
"He'll screw my life if he's in it"

440
00:30:28,229 --> 00:30:30,541
"Smile with love in your heart"

441
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:33,423
"Take a selfie with me"

442
00:30:36,072 --> 00:30:38,728
"Take a selfie with me"

443
00:30:41,103 --> 00:30:43,861
"Earth is miniscule in the milky way"

444
00:30:43,916 --> 00:30:46,196
"You're like a sand grain on this planet"

445
00:30:46,298 --> 00:30:49,509
"Don't waste this short life being jealous"

446
00:30:51,744 --> 00:30:54,455
"Take a selfie with me"

447
00:30:56,837 --> 00:30:59,587
"Take a selfie with me"

448
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:27,876
"Don't hide jealousy
behind this beautiful face"

449
00:31:27,955 --> 00:31:30,798
"Take a selfie with me"

450
00:31:30,861 --> 00:31:35,415
"Jealousy is lurking from
behind your moustache"

451
00:31:35,751 --> 00:31:40,688
"Why do you get upset at the
mention of some other girl?"

452
00:31:40,767 --> 00:31:47,243
"Why do you guys keep hating
on girls and their lifestyle?"

453
00:31:49,089 --> 00:31:49,980
"With me"

454
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:51,386
"With me"

455
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,964
"Take a selfie with me"

456
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:02,089
"Take a selfie with me"

457
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:27,870
"Appreciate what you cannot do"

458
00:32:28,003 --> 00:32:30,534
"Learn from those above you"

459
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:33,206
"Take a selfie with me"

460
00:32:33,308 --> 00:32:35,792
"Keep calm when you lose something"

461
00:32:35,902 --> 00:32:37,995
"Forget what could never be yours"

462
00:32:38,503 --> 00:32:43,339
"Don't envy others for all that they have"

463
00:32:43,402 --> 00:32:49,745
"Don't stress your heart
by craving others' life"

464
00:32:54,152 --> 00:32:56,980
"All the boys and girls on
the floor, stop for a second"

465
00:32:57,011 --> 00:32:59,745
"Take a selfie with me"

466
00:33:01,886 --> 00:33:04,808
"Take a selfie with me"

467
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:27,268
You're someone who counts
likes on your Facebook post.

468
00:33:27,823 --> 00:33:35,010
I'm someone with fans
who'd die for a selfie with me.

469
00:33:35,503 --> 00:33:36,386
Understand?

470
00:33:37,425 --> 00:33:40,556
You played him 'cause
you didn't know him that well.

471
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:44,392
You're of the impression
that he can't resist you.

472
00:33:44,417 --> 00:33:46,230
What actually happened is...

473
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,799
You can't resist his charm.

474
00:33:49,002 --> 00:33:50,612
Don't get it?

475
00:33:51,244 --> 00:33:52,284
Follow me.

476
00:33:54,655 --> 00:33:55,968
This is Mr. Phani Bhupal.

477
00:33:57,444 --> 00:33:59,202
I know what your doubt is.

478
00:33:59,428 --> 00:34:01,350
He believes in Numerology.

479
00:34:01,421 --> 00:34:03,835
That is why he writes Phani as 'F-A-N-I'.

480
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:09,780
Single dealer for multiple
brands in both the Telugu States.

481
00:34:10,343 --> 00:34:11,444
Condoms!

482
00:34:13,678 --> 00:34:16,327
They say wind can't capture
the pace of Lord Rama's arrow.

483
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,241
He shuffles through girls that quickly.

484
00:34:19,882 --> 00:34:21,827
Coming to his son, his name is Karthik.

485
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,803
The selfie guy.

486
00:34:25,257 --> 00:34:26,897
The company he's floating...

487
00:34:28,186 --> 00:34:29,132
Dull?

488
00:34:29,452 --> 00:34:31,209
Is he also crazy about Numerology?

489
00:34:31,241 --> 00:34:33,413
His company grooms dull looking brides.

490
00:34:33,499 --> 00:34:35,928
From makeup to wedding pack up...

491
00:34:36,014 --> 00:34:38,428
They look after everything
that a bride needs.

492
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,233
He's a big flirt.

493
00:34:40,258 --> 00:34:44,280
There were hundreds of suitors for Sita.

494
00:34:44,319 --> 00:34:48,475
But, Lord Rama broke
the bow and married her.

495
00:34:48,507 --> 00:34:51,701
Let's see what this man is capable of.

496
00:34:59,076 --> 00:35:00,944
Why don't you give a lift?

497
00:35:02,178 --> 00:35:03,913
You idiot!

498
00:35:05,326 --> 00:35:07,295
Didn't find anyone today, sir?

499
00:35:08,186 --> 00:35:11,553
Why are you being a miser, sir?
Get a bus pass.

500
00:35:11,757 --> 00:35:13,389
Listen, you fool.

501
00:35:13,475 --> 00:35:15,382
Two people can sit on a bike.

502
00:35:15,858 --> 00:35:17,882
Two people can travel on that fuel.

503
00:35:18,132 --> 00:35:20,600
If only one guy rides each bike...

504
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:23,319
a lot of fuel is going to waste.

505
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:28,382
Approximately 7 crore litres of
petrol is used in India every day.

506
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:35,092
At the current price, 500-600 crores
are being spent on fuel on an average.

507
00:35:35,749 --> 00:35:39,350
If bike and car owners act
responsible and give a lift...

508
00:35:39,577 --> 00:35:42,046
If responsible citizens
like us ask for a lift...

509
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:43,514
So much fuel is saved.

510
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,671
So much money is saved.

511
00:35:45,882 --> 00:35:47,725
You have no concern for your country.

512
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:49,843
But, you have tons of free advice.

513
00:35:50,007 --> 00:35:51,632
Bloody illiterates!

514
00:35:56,085 --> 00:35:56,702
I have an idea!

515
00:35:57,069 --> 00:35:57,843
Let's use him.

516
00:35:58,569 --> 00:35:59,616
Hello, bro!

517
00:35:59,897 --> 00:36:01,007
Come, I'll give you a lift.

518
00:36:01,217 --> 00:36:04,397
Look. Guys like him are
the backbone of our country.

519
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,155
Here. You only keep it.

520
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:10,943
What? Are you in love?

521
00:36:11,022 --> 00:36:12,616
Hmm. Something like that.

522
00:36:13,624 --> 00:36:15,928
What do you mean?

523
00:36:16,616 --> 00:36:18,249
You'll find out in some time.

524
00:36:18,413 --> 00:36:19,038
Oh!

525
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:24,139
Hey! Hey!
- Hold on tight, bro!

526
00:36:25,287 --> 00:36:27,256
Ah, I'm dead!

527
00:36:27,507 --> 00:36:29,514
Hey!
- Madam!

528
00:36:29,803 --> 00:36:31,468
My friend is badly hurt.

529
00:36:31,514 --> 00:36:33,093
Can you give him first-aid?

530
00:36:33,163 --> 00:36:34,921
What a performance!

531
00:36:35,288 --> 00:36:37,335
You didn't even check if I'm alright.

532
00:36:38,335 --> 00:36:40,444
How can I help?
- You're a doctor, right?

533
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:42,194
There's a plus sign on your bike.

534
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:45,100
Being a doctor isn't enough.

535
00:36:45,257 --> 00:36:46,928
I should have the first aid kit, right?

536
00:36:46,991 --> 00:36:48,108
Come on, don't be silly.

537
00:36:48,218 --> 00:36:49,999
You must be carrying it in your hood. Look.

538
00:36:50,632 --> 00:36:51,827
I meant the bike's hood.

539
00:36:58,678 --> 00:36:59,475
Here.

540
00:37:03,866 --> 00:37:06,218
I called you the backbone of the country.

541
00:37:06,553 --> 00:37:09,327
But, you broke my backbone for your love.

542
00:37:10,108 --> 00:37:13,678
Stop staring at her like that
Are you going to eat her up?

543
00:37:14,546 --> 00:37:16,296
He's out of danger, right, doctor?

544
00:37:17,507 --> 00:37:19,608
I can't believe you, man!

545
00:37:24,647 --> 00:37:25,569
Hey!

546
00:37:29,202 --> 00:37:31,959
Sir, care for a glass of juice?
- Uh-huh. No.

547
00:37:33,741 --> 00:37:34,936
Thank god, he's here.

548
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:35,694
Hi, bro.

549
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,194
Hey, you!
- No!

550
00:37:37,335 --> 00:37:38,803
What? Don't you want a lift today?

551
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,803
I thought I'd give you a lift
'cause you care about the country.

552
00:37:42,897 --> 00:37:44,694
If you give up, who's
going to care anymore?

553
00:37:46,616 --> 00:37:48,194
Shall I go?
- Anything happened?

554
00:37:48,241 --> 00:37:48,960
Nothing.

555
00:37:52,452 --> 00:37:53,233
Come fast!

556
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,733
I'm such a miser!

557
00:38:00,866 --> 00:38:02,944
I knew he was trouble
and still hopped on his bike.

558
00:38:03,038 --> 00:38:04,749
I deserve this.

559
00:38:07,686 --> 00:38:08,960
Keep trying, man.

560
00:38:09,147 --> 00:38:12,412
She's going to reject you someday
It's my curse.

561
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:14,546
He's out of danger, right, doctor?
- He's absolutely fine.

562
00:38:14,663 --> 00:38:17,225
Take the same medication as yesterday.

563
00:38:22,053 --> 00:38:23,757
Hey, bro. Are you ready?

564
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:27,475
Yeah, 2 minutes.
- Take 4 minutes, No problem.

565
00:38:28,358 --> 00:38:29,022
See you.

566
00:38:30,303 --> 00:38:31,108
Bro, hurry up.

567
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,218
What, bro?

568
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:37,975
Hell-Met!

569
00:38:38,444 --> 00:38:40,483
There's the stone
Dash in the centre.

570
00:38:40,514 --> 00:38:42,468
You hold on tight, bro!
- Hit it!

571
00:38:46,038 --> 00:38:46,968
Don't laugh, bro.

572
00:38:52,757 --> 00:38:55,615
I know you'll crash here
So, I thought I'd come and wait.

573
00:38:57,475 --> 00:38:59,725
Oh, shit!

574
00:38:59,999 --> 00:39:02,733
I'm safe, dear
Gods must be crazy.

575
00:39:02,858 --> 00:39:04,960
Why do you ride when
you clearly suck at it?

576
00:39:05,069 --> 00:39:06,718
I'm damn good at riding.

577
00:39:07,475 --> 00:39:08,553
I mean, bike riding.

578
00:39:09,577 --> 00:39:12,460
You fall flat on your face
when you're over confident.

579
00:39:12,522 --> 00:39:13,936
I don't mind.

580
00:39:13,975 --> 00:39:15,350
I'll get what I want.

581
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,100
You can't always get what you want.

582
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,944
Not as easy as injuring yourself.

583
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,389
Understand?

584
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:24,248
Do you know what we call this?

585
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:28,975
The God up there looks over you
The God down here saves you.

586
00:39:33,608 --> 00:39:36,538
Hey! Are you hurt badly?

587
00:39:37,327 --> 00:39:39,538
She turned around and looked.

588
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:42,514
No, bro. It's like she's turning me on.

589
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,468
I should take my guru's advice.

590
00:39:44,553 --> 00:39:46,412
The guy who's on radio at 8PM?
- Hey!

591
00:39:46,811 --> 00:39:49,671
The one and only romantic guru,
Mr. Phani Bhupal.

592
00:39:49,966 --> 00:39:51,247
My father!

593
00:39:51,388 --> 00:39:53,075
Father?!

594
00:39:58,388 --> 00:40:01,653
Wow! Hats off to his creativity!

595
00:40:01,678 --> 00:40:02,522
Let's go!

596
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:05,450
Hi, sir.
- Hey, Rosie. What's dad been up to?

597
00:40:05,489 --> 00:40:07,880
Two girls came down from Bangalore
He's watching a demo with them.

598
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:09,146
Demo!

599
00:40:09,544 --> 00:40:11,294
Demo for this product?
- Hold on.

600
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,982
It's always better in person, sir.

601
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:15,799
Doesn't mean you see the demo in office.

602
00:40:16,433 --> 00:40:18,909
They're showing him the sample products
What's your problem?

603
00:40:18,964 --> 00:40:21,683
You're watching way too many adult movies
Everything is dirty in your eyes.

604
00:40:21,823 --> 00:40:23,503
I'm surrounded by dirty minds.

605
00:40:23,566 --> 00:40:24,815
What do you expect?

606
00:40:25,112 --> 00:40:26,315
This is who I've become.
- Hey, you! Come here.

607
00:40:26,355 --> 00:40:27,167
Coming.

608
00:40:27,316 --> 00:40:28,370
I'll see you later.

609
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:29,932
Good morning, sir.

610
00:40:29,957 --> 00:40:30,651
Hi, sir.

611
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,651
All female employees?
- That's strange for a male product.

612
00:40:35,003 --> 00:40:37,846
Customer satisfaction is more
important than customers themselves.

613
00:40:38,386 --> 00:40:41,292
This product has got bad feedback
It's rejected.

614
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:46,003
This one's dotted and
this one's fragrant, sir.

615
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:47,979
Quality check has also been performed.

616
00:40:48,004 --> 00:40:50,081
But, they're a bit on the expensive side.

617
00:40:50,128 --> 00:40:52,229
How expensive?

618
00:40:53,128 --> 00:40:54,433
Forget it. I'm kidding.

619
00:40:54,905 --> 00:40:57,718
See? Making love is an expression.

620
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:00,468
You should feel it at once.

621
00:41:01,749 --> 00:41:02,608
So, why two?

622
00:41:04,116 --> 00:41:05,483
Make it two in one.

623
00:41:08,077 --> 00:41:09,929
So, let's work it out.

624
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:13,554
Let's discuss it over dinner tonight?

625
00:41:13,749 --> 00:41:14,968
Wine with dining?

626
00:41:14,993 --> 00:41:15,866
Hmm.

627
00:41:16,554 --> 00:41:17,554
Okay, fine.

628
00:41:17,655 --> 00:41:18,499
Jerry...

629
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,358
Ah, he's here!
- Bye, sir.

630
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:23,124
He'll also be joining us tonight?

631
00:41:23,187 --> 00:41:24,937
No. Only me.

632
00:41:27,562 --> 00:41:28,483
I'll be joining too.

633
00:41:28,593 --> 00:41:30,640
You're amazing, uncle.
- What did I do?

634
00:41:32,342 --> 00:41:35,217
Tommy...why are you dull?

635
00:41:39,593 --> 00:41:41,780
So, you really like her.

636
00:41:41,921 --> 00:41:42,765
A++.

637
00:41:42,976 --> 00:41:44,741
Whoa! That's a huge ranking.

638
00:41:44,851 --> 00:41:47,530
Uma. She's a doctor.
- How's the ride coming along?

639
00:41:47,718 --> 00:41:49,476
She's a bit stubborn.
Doesn't respond at all.

640
00:41:53,468 --> 00:41:55,382
Riding on the highway is smooth.

641
00:41:55,796 --> 00:41:57,655
But, riding in the city is actual fun.

642
00:42:03,007 --> 00:42:05,116
She's a doctor, right?
You need to find patients.

643
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:08,694
Ma'am, somebody's here to see you
Shall I send him in?

644
00:42:09,921 --> 00:42:10,983
Hmm.

645
00:42:11,008 --> 00:42:12,952
Oh, god! He's everywhere.

646
00:42:13,187 --> 00:42:14,671
No. Tell him I'm busy.

647
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:17,108
I did, ma'am. He said he'd wait.

648
00:42:18,015 --> 00:42:19,374
You check the reports.

649
00:42:19,772 --> 00:42:21,679
I'll deal with him meanwhile.

650
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:23,303
It's you?!

651
00:42:23,593 --> 00:42:24,304
Yeah, me.

652
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:26,483
I didn't expect you to show up.

653
00:42:26,812 --> 00:42:29,015
You don't sound honest.

654
00:42:29,093 --> 00:42:30,562
How do I sound then?

655
00:42:31,233 --> 00:42:38,991
It's like you expected somebody
else to show up instead of me.

656
00:42:40,748 --> 00:42:42,613
Meera...
- Yes, ma'am?

657
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:47,082
Oh. Meera's your assistant, huh?

658
00:42:47,894 --> 00:42:50,324
Anyway, is it right what I just said?

659
00:42:50,887 --> 00:42:52,083
Umm... Uma!

660
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:54,614
Actually, I have a seminar
in Bangalore this evening.

661
00:42:54,754 --> 00:42:57,911
If you have any idea about
relationships, you could give a talk.

662
00:42:58,051 --> 00:42:58,801
Excuse me.

663
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:01,145
It's you?!
- Should I call Meera?

664
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:03,668
I'm genuinely shocked this time.

665
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,957
Oh, I wonder why.

666
00:43:06,129 --> 00:43:08,301
What are you doing here?
- I need treatment, doctor.

667
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,520
You seem fine.

668
00:43:12,114 --> 00:43:13,684
But, he's not.
- Who is he?

669
00:43:13,997 --> 00:43:15,083
Sunny.
- You are?

670
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,473
His brother.
- Oh.

671
00:43:17,598 --> 00:43:18,738
What's the problem?

672
00:43:18,817 --> 00:43:19,684
Tell her.

673
00:43:19,817 --> 00:43:20,950
My stomach hurts.

674
00:43:21,036 --> 00:43:22,520
Stomach hurts!
- Go!...

675
00:43:22,786 --> 00:43:24,598
Are you his brother?
- Kind of.

676
00:43:24,895 --> 00:43:26,153
Different mothers?

677
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:29,043
Different fathers as well.
- What?! How is that possible?

678
00:43:29,137 --> 00:43:31,176
We're cousins
I'm his uncle's son.

679
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,668
Wait...

680
00:43:32,817 --> 00:43:34,606
So, your father is his uncle.

681
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:36,402
So, your father's the younger child.

682
00:43:36,473 --> 00:43:39,184
How did you become the elder one here?

683
00:43:40,114 --> 00:43:43,254
You see, I'm my dad's first child.

684
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:46,004
He's his dad's second child.
- Oh!

685
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:50,754
You'll be fine.
- Okay, doctor.

686
00:43:50,786 --> 00:43:51,606
Let's go, boy.

687
00:43:51,684 --> 00:43:53,762
This guy Sunny... He's funny, right?

688
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,653
You tell me, Uma.

689
00:43:55,989 --> 00:43:58,379
About relationship and stuff.

690
00:43:58,801 --> 00:43:59,551
Excuse me.

691
00:44:00,661 --> 00:44:01,918
Why are you back again?

692
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:03,722
Treatment again, doctor.

693
00:44:06,254 --> 00:44:07,800
Who is this?
- My elder brother's son.

694
00:44:07,909 --> 00:44:10,346
Whoa! Earlier, your
dad was the kid's uncle.

695
00:44:10,425 --> 00:44:11,581
Now, you're this kid's uncle.

696
00:44:11,659 --> 00:44:12,432
Nice.

697
00:44:12,472 --> 00:44:14,222
What's your problem?
- What problem?

698
00:44:15,034 --> 00:44:18,276
I had a bad headache when I was a kid.

699
00:44:18,386 --> 00:44:19,136
Come.

700
00:44:20,878 --> 00:44:23,440
What's the relation between the 2 kids?

701
00:44:24,214 --> 00:44:26,487
I'm this uncle's kid
That kid is my little brother.

702
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:28,026
So, that kid's an uncle to this kid.

703
00:44:28,058 --> 00:44:30,323
Hey! That kid is younger than this kid.

704
00:44:30,448 --> 00:44:32,596
How can he be the uncle? Answer me.

705
00:44:33,448 --> 00:44:35,448
You see, after his mom
gave birth to this kid...

706
00:44:35,473 --> 00:44:37,401
His grandma gave
birth to that kid's father.

707
00:44:38,276 --> 00:44:39,315
Oh, my god!

708
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:41,784
So, mother-in-law and
daughter-in-law were pregnant together?

709
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:42,800
Yeah. Same time.

710
00:44:42,825 --> 00:44:44,448
Holy shit!

711
00:44:44,597 --> 00:44:46,979
He'll never have
headache in his life again.

712
00:44:47,026 --> 00:44:48,815
Okay, doctor
Let's go, boy.

713
00:44:53,347 --> 00:44:54,081
Excuse me.

714
00:44:54,894 --> 00:44:56,472
Excuse me.

715
00:44:56,497 --> 00:44:57,434
Last question.

716
00:44:57,798 --> 00:45:01,385
Both the brothers share
the same relations, right?

717
00:45:01,409 --> 00:45:02,050
No.

718
00:45:02,378 --> 00:45:04,847
Why not? That's what we analyzed till now.

719
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:07,019
Will my wife be your wife, bro?

720
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,034
No...No chance.

721
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:18,331
Whoo! Valid point!

722
00:45:18,456 --> 00:45:20,784
No chance, Uma
Note it down. We'll forget.

723
00:45:21,347 --> 00:45:22,159
Done!

724
00:45:22,206 --> 00:45:24,019
Mind blowing and fantastic, bro!

725
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:26,714
Uma, this is enough
material for my seminar.

726
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:28,925
Oh, my god! I'm running
late for the seminar.

727
00:45:28,972 --> 00:45:30,394
I'll make a move, okay?
Bye...

728
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:34,573
What is this, Karthik?
- What do you mean?

729
00:45:35,378 --> 00:45:36,917
Okay, Karthik. I'm sorry.

730
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:37,964
Sorry?!

731
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:41,104
I'm engaged to that guy who just left.

732
00:45:42,581 --> 00:45:47,034
My friend Priyanka bet that
no guy would look at me again.

733
00:45:47,394 --> 00:45:51,925
So, I moved closely with you,
just to test her theory.

734
00:45:53,222 --> 00:45:55,581
Can I know who that friend is?

735
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,308
Is that her? Aivanka...

736
00:45:58,425 --> 00:45:59,464
It's Priyanka.

737
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:00,612
Some shit!

738
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:04,651
Our Constitution says that
every crime should be punished.

739
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:07,448
Know that?
- Garuda Puranam also says the same, sir.

740
00:46:08,909 --> 00:46:11,487
You're good at mythology
and polluting minds.

741
00:46:13,995 --> 00:46:17,058
You deserve punishment for your crime.

742
00:46:17,144 --> 00:46:19,105
Let's do a few sit ups, girl.

743
00:46:19,542 --> 00:46:21,777
You think that'll compensate?

744
00:46:21,972 --> 00:46:23,027
No way!

745
00:46:23,128 --> 00:46:26,612
Why are you taking
this so seriously, Karthik?

746
00:46:26,722 --> 00:46:29,104
We all know that you're a flirt.

747
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:30,198
Flirt?

748
00:46:30,894 --> 00:46:32,097
Who told you?

749
00:46:32,238 --> 00:46:35,628
When your brought your father
to the hospital, I followed you.

750
00:46:36,081 --> 00:46:38,003
Doctor!

751
00:46:38,105 --> 00:46:40,464
One side love, huh?

752
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:42,488
Something like that.

753
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:45,776
But, when I saw you hang
out with so many girls...

754
00:46:45,808 --> 00:46:47,370
One side break up, huh?

755
00:46:47,464 --> 00:46:48,941
Something like that.

756
00:46:49,222 --> 00:46:50,980
Priyanka fell in love with me.

757
00:46:51,152 --> 00:46:52,722
Does that make me a flirt?

758
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,581
Anyway, that's not the topic.

759
00:46:55,019 --> 00:46:57,941
You deserve punishment for your crime.

760
00:46:58,027 --> 00:46:59,612
Bah! What do you want me to do now?

761
00:46:59,722 --> 00:47:01,558
3 dates, I want 3 dates with you.

762
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:02,097
What?!

763
00:47:03,113 --> 00:47:06,105
I didn't ask you out
Don't be so shocked.

764
00:47:07,034 --> 00:47:08,206
But, Karthik...

765
00:47:08,347 --> 00:47:12,776
Your fake performance
that day ruined all my focus.

766
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:17,050
If you don't want to do down
in history as a heart breaker...

767
00:47:17,409 --> 00:47:19,144
Accept my conditions.

768
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,988
Let's not go that far.

769
00:47:21,113 --> 00:47:22,042
Just say yes, girl.

770
00:47:22,386 --> 00:47:23,183
You shut up!

771
00:47:23,238 --> 00:47:25,300
You only said, 'Virginity isn't
something to do with the body'.

772
00:47:25,325 --> 00:47:26,589
'It's a matter of the heart.'

773
00:47:26,855 --> 00:47:30,737
If you hadn't met me
my heart would've remained virgin.

774
00:47:30,823 --> 00:47:33,659
My heart lost its virginity because of you.

775
00:47:33,745 --> 00:47:35,534
The least you could do is satisfy its ego.

776
00:47:36,034 --> 00:47:38,292
Okay. Alright
I'll go out with you.

777
00:47:38,581 --> 00:47:40,277
But, remember. Just 3 dates.

778
00:47:40,425 --> 00:47:42,431
We go separate ways after that, okay?

779
00:47:42,456 --> 00:47:43,550
That's good!

780
00:47:44,113 --> 00:47:46,425
Be ready for dinner tonight.

781
00:47:46,965 --> 00:47:48,512
[singing randomly]

782
00:48:03,222 --> 00:48:06,284
I arrange everything, only
for you guys to mess it up.

783
00:48:06,434 --> 00:48:09,348
Damn! Everything is scattered.

784
00:48:09,527 --> 00:48:12,004
You should take a look
at our neighbor's house.

785
00:48:13,918 --> 00:48:15,981
So well kept!

786
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,434
I must be crazy.

787
00:48:17,582 --> 00:48:19,582
I've been watching them since years.

788
00:48:19,637 --> 00:48:22,566
They won't change their ways even if I die.

789
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:26,793
Venkata Rao and his son
don't even have coffee together.

790
00:48:26,863 --> 00:48:29,816
But this father and son,
they booze so shamelessly.

791
00:48:30,386 --> 00:48:31,894
Bah! Two remaining again!

792
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:33,839
I'll play once more.

793
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:36,059
At least, don't avoid me so obviously.

794
00:48:36,106 --> 00:48:40,636
I'm going on yelling
and you keep on playing.

795
00:48:40,987 --> 00:48:45,011
Oh! You've got eyes on leafy veggies today.

796
00:48:45,144 --> 00:48:47,683
That's a new found interest in health.

797
00:48:51,941 --> 00:48:52,605
Jerry...

798
00:48:52,637 --> 00:48:53,293
Ah!

799
00:48:54,106 --> 00:48:55,770
Sounds like music after a tsunami.

800
00:49:02,035 --> 00:49:04,324
You're tolerating so
much for these fritters?

801
00:49:05,301 --> 00:49:06,402
I don't care what you think.

802
00:49:07,379 --> 00:49:09,410
But, her fritters are out of the world.

803
00:49:10,777 --> 00:49:12,371
Want some?
- No, thanks.

804
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,926
I'm going out for dinner.

805
00:49:15,042 --> 00:49:16,074
Where?

806
00:49:16,145 --> 00:49:17,184
With whom?

807
00:49:20,027 --> 00:49:21,386
Do you know Chakri from before?

808
00:49:21,449 --> 00:49:24,433
No. We just met.
- Oh, is it?

809
00:49:25,793 --> 00:49:27,410
Karthik... What is this?

810
00:49:27,863 --> 00:49:29,988
Shalu, this is what.

811
00:49:31,496 --> 00:49:32,715
Check these once.

812
00:49:34,387 --> 00:49:35,168
Shall we go?

813
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,371
Hmm.
- Come.

814
00:49:39,129 --> 00:49:39,793
Waiter...
- Sorry.

815
00:49:39,957 --> 00:49:42,839
I saw you with her back
there and misunderstood you.

816
00:49:42,864 --> 00:49:44,324
It's okay. Order something.

817
00:49:46,409 --> 00:49:47,651
Wow!

818
00:49:56,525 --> 00:49:57,549
Karthik...
- Huh?

819
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,338
How do you say 'Wonder' in Telugu?

820
00:50:00,674 --> 00:50:01,555
Wonder!

821
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:03,860
Wonderful!

822
00:50:05,401 --> 00:50:06,596
You don't know?

823
00:50:06,711 --> 00:50:07,742
It's called 'Adbhutam'.

824
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,602
Adbhutam [Wonderful!] !
- Hmm. Wonderful indeed!

825
00:50:10,696 --> 00:50:11,625
Wonderful!

826
00:50:12,274 --> 00:50:13,227
I got you!

827
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,914
What's the last syllable
in 'Nemali' in English?

828
00:50:16,577 --> 00:50:19,773
Simple. 'Nemali' is Peacock in English.

829
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:21,867
The last syllable in Peacock is co...

830
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:23,901
Write it down.

831
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,807
The second half of 'Nagupamu'
in English is a word in itself.

832
00:50:27,268 --> 00:50:29,713
It's so difficult, Uma.
- Use your brain, Karthik.

833
00:50:29,963 --> 00:50:31,931
'Nagupamu' is called Cobra in English.

834
00:50:32,018 --> 00:50:33,955
So, the first half is Co
and the second half is Bra.

835
00:50:34,065 --> 00:50:36,580
Hey! It's right here. You can check.

836
00:50:37,573 --> 00:50:38,604
Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

837
00:50:39,034 --> 00:50:40,487
Hmm. Write it down.

838
00:50:43,612 --> 00:50:45,244
Order, please.
- 3 bra and one cock.

839
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:45,893
Huh?!

840
00:50:46,416 --> 00:50:48,455
I mean, 3 brandy and one coke.

841
00:50:48,776 --> 00:50:49,784
Is he crazy?

842
00:50:53,666 --> 00:50:57,049
Thank you, everyone, for being
here on the occasion of our divorce

843
00:50:57,159 --> 00:50:59,901
You might be the first
ones to celebrate divorce.

844
00:51:00,174 --> 00:51:00,901
Thanks.

845
00:51:01,049 --> 00:51:02,487
Congratulations, boss!

846
00:51:02,549 --> 00:51:04,767
It's better to separate
when it's not working out.

847
00:51:04,822 --> 00:51:05,892
Thanks, Karthik.

848
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:08,830
Umm...

849
00:51:09,002 --> 00:51:11,182
If you don't mind, may I know the reason?

850
00:51:11,252 --> 00:51:12,338
Reason!

851
00:51:13,205 --> 00:51:14,166
Reason is...

852
00:51:14,198 --> 00:51:15,252
You know that...

853
00:51:15,307 --> 00:51:16,166
Know what?

854
00:51:16,299 --> 00:51:19,080
You know, what happens in the bedroom...

855
00:51:19,604 --> 00:51:21,034
Oh, that!

856
00:51:21,299 --> 00:51:23,314
That's the problem.

857
00:51:23,362 --> 00:51:24,182
What?!

858
00:51:25,096 --> 00:51:27,346
Chakri is like a fricking honey bee.

859
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:30,214
He can never get enough of the nectar.

860
00:51:30,948 --> 00:51:32,659
It can't be all that you do, right?

861
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,112
Is it that important?

862
00:51:34,143 --> 00:51:37,729
When you get married,
that's pretty much all you do, right?

863
00:51:38,464 --> 00:51:40,190
Who says it's not important?

864
00:51:40,479 --> 00:51:43,495
Shalu, just as common
hunger and thirst are...

865
00:51:43,901 --> 00:51:47,213
Sex is a pretty common thing.

866
00:51:47,706 --> 00:51:51,276
Sexologists are in high demand
'cause people aren't doing it enough.

867
00:51:52,081 --> 00:51:58,087
That's why our elders keep
asking how our married life is.

868
00:51:58,173 --> 00:51:59,540
What do you mean?

869
00:52:00,056 --> 00:52:02,305
You know, sex life.

870
00:52:05,267 --> 00:52:09,876
It's a pure activity that
comes naturally to us.

871
00:52:11,884 --> 00:52:16,314
Anything in the world could be
left incomplete once it begins.

872
00:52:16,986 --> 00:52:21,837
But, if there's anything that
definitely has a climax, it's sex.

873
00:52:22,376 --> 00:52:25,806
Just as necessary love
and affection is for a couple...

874
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:28,556
Sex is equally necessary.

875
00:52:31,946 --> 00:52:33,189
You ask if it's important.

876
00:52:33,837 --> 00:52:35,353
What if he was impotent?

877
00:52:44,196 --> 00:52:45,298
Thanks, Karthik.

878
00:52:46,681 --> 00:52:48,603
[dialogue inaudible]

879
00:53:01,267 --> 00:53:04,126
Hey, Uma! Uma! Where are you going?

880
00:53:05,001 --> 00:53:07,102
Date is over, right? I'm headed home.

881
00:53:07,134 --> 00:53:10,743
Hey! Drinking and driving is not good.

882
00:53:12,306 --> 00:53:14,400
I'll book a cab.

883
00:53:15,462 --> 00:53:19,571
Hey! It's better to ride with
me than a complete stranger.

884
00:53:20,603 --> 00:53:23,837
You should consider
dialogue writing as a profession.

885
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:26,564
Really?! I have more
I'd love your feedback.

886
00:53:27,087 --> 00:53:28,470
Start the car, Karthik!

887
00:53:32,436 --> 00:53:33,483
Karthik...

888
00:53:34,124 --> 00:53:36,647
Consider this our second date.

889
00:53:36,718 --> 00:53:37,483
What?!

890
00:53:37,983 --> 00:53:40,382
Dinner was our first date.

891
00:53:42,265 --> 00:53:43,702
This ride is our second date.

892
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:44,991
Uh-huh?

893
00:53:45,296 --> 00:53:47,983
Pay me when you get down
and consider this a cab ride.

894
00:53:50,046 --> 00:53:52,476
You think you're smart?
- What are you murmuring?

895
00:53:52,874 --> 00:53:54,335
Nothing, Karthik.

896
00:53:54,405 --> 00:53:56,015
I'm doing mouth exercises.

897
00:53:56,429 --> 00:53:58,444
Oh, really? Good. Keep going.

898
00:54:04,936 --> 00:54:08,741
After telling you the truth,
my guilt went whoops in the air.

899
00:54:14,452 --> 00:54:15,116
Ouch!

900
00:54:16,015 --> 00:54:17,796
The window's closed?

901
00:54:17,858 --> 00:54:18,936
Yeah. Are you hurt?

902
00:54:19,015 --> 00:54:20,483
Will you open it, please?

903
00:54:20,508 --> 00:54:21,866
No!...

904
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:24,936
I want to feel free!

905
00:54:33,905 --> 00:54:36,530
[singing randomly]

906
00:54:48,171 --> 00:54:49,295
Karthik!

907
00:54:49,436 --> 00:54:50,061
Yeah?

908
00:54:50,507 --> 00:54:51,733
What are you doing there?

909
00:54:51,827 --> 00:54:54,679
Nature call!
- Bah, Karthik!

910
00:54:55,179 --> 00:54:57,733
What? Do you also need to pee?

911
00:54:57,796 --> 00:54:59,358
You're so dead today!

912
00:54:59,507 --> 00:55:01,647
No! You'll be scared.

913
00:55:02,827 --> 00:55:04,624
[singing randomly]

914
00:55:06,046 --> 00:55:08,999
Where are we right now?
- 100 kilometers away from Hyderabad.

915
00:55:09,077 --> 00:55:11,702
Oh, damn! Ugh!!! How dare you!

916
00:55:13,218 --> 00:55:15,835
You brought me so far
without my permission.

917
00:55:17,601 --> 00:55:19,765
I asked you
Try to recall.

918
00:55:25,843 --> 00:55:26,921
I don't remember.

919
00:55:28,288 --> 00:55:29,460
Take me back quickly.

920
00:55:29,811 --> 00:55:31,171
I'll kill you otherwise.

921
00:55:41,882 --> 00:55:43,374
Of course, I'd yell at you for being gone.

922
00:55:43,405 --> 00:55:45,140
Where were you all night?

923
00:55:45,165 --> 00:55:48,360
Thought you could break
all the rules in one go?

924
00:55:49,171 --> 00:55:52,186
Damn it! I didn't do anything reckless.

925
00:55:52,483 --> 00:55:53,882
What happened then?

926
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,967
Actually...
- Actually...

927
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:00,421
Actually...

928
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:02,217
Mom, I have a gift for you.

929
00:56:02,624 --> 00:56:03,882
Oh, no!

930
00:56:15,811 --> 00:56:17,413
[dialogue unclear]

931
00:56:27,999 --> 00:56:30,726
I'm upset and you find it funny?

932
00:56:30,811 --> 00:56:32,147
What else do you want me to do?

933
00:56:32,186 --> 00:56:34,936
You do nothing
I'll handle him.

934
00:56:35,006 --> 00:56:36,271
What will you do?

935
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:38,304
He got me into deep shit.

936
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,178
I'll do the same to him.

937
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:41,022
How?

938
00:56:41,396 --> 00:56:42,780
He'll call, right?

939
00:56:42,851 --> 00:56:46,319
Call me. Karthik, call me!

940
00:56:46,344 --> 00:56:49,717
You're so confident that he'll call you.
- Call me, damn it!

941
00:56:52,546 --> 00:56:53,780
He will call, Uma.

942
00:56:54,288 --> 00:56:55,061
He will call.

943
00:57:00,358 --> 00:57:03,358
Call me, man! I'm waiting!

944
00:57:04,857 --> 00:57:05,607
Call me.

945
00:57:06,259 --> 00:57:07,024
Call me.

946
00:57:11,188 --> 00:57:13,008
Two minutes
He'll call now. Okay?

947
00:57:13,126 --> 00:57:16,703
Waiting for her call?
- No. I'm waiting to call her.

948
00:57:16,938 --> 00:57:20,110
Why are you holding back?
- 'Cause I can't forget how arrogant she is.

949
00:57:20,157 --> 00:57:21,907
Forget all that and just call her.
- You think so?

950
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,251
Yeah, call her.
- Okay.

951
00:57:27,376 --> 00:57:29,915
You waited for so long
Pick up already!

952
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:33,259
I'll look desperate if I
answer immediately.

953
00:57:33,423 --> 00:57:35,000
Why isn't she answering?

954
00:57:35,595 --> 00:57:36,961
She wouldn't be a girl if
she answered right away.

955
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:38,158
I wouldn't be a guy if I didn't call.

956
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:39,102
Let me call again.

957
00:57:39,266 --> 00:57:41,758
Don't worry
He'll call again.

958
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:45,806
Yes! I told you! Yay!!

959
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:48,172
Hi, Karthik!

960
00:57:48,274 --> 00:57:49,704
Hi, Uma!

961
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:51,672
Are you busy?

962
00:57:51,711 --> 00:57:54,672
Kind of.
- Why? It's the weekend.

963
00:57:54,697 --> 00:57:56,924
I'm not done with my wedding shopping yet

964
00:57:57,133 --> 00:58:02,461
So, I'm headed to Inorbit Mall.

965
00:58:02,489 --> 00:58:04,270
Call you back when I'm free
Okay, bye.

966
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,703
Hey, Karthik!
- Uma!

967
00:58:09,891 --> 00:58:11,875
Hi! What a surprise!
What are you doing here?

968
00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:13,360
I... I...

969
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:16,570
What? You're shopping?
- What a cute performance!

970
00:58:16,766 --> 00:58:17,977
No. I'm visiting the circus.

971
00:58:18,055 --> 00:58:20,664
That's where you'll end up after today.

972
00:58:20,852 --> 00:58:22,188
Welcome to all!

973
00:58:22,336 --> 00:58:28,203
Every creature on this planet...

974
00:58:29,123 --> 00:58:32,437
Is it heavy? Let me hold it
Karthik, there's some event going on.

975
00:58:32,586 --> 00:58:33,414
Let's check it out.

976
00:58:33,541 --> 00:58:34,992
These aren't enough to live.

977
00:58:35,149 --> 00:58:45,008
Life feels complete with love,
friendship and affection.

978
00:58:46,352 --> 00:58:49,747
Let's spread love with a small hug.

979
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:54,383
A guy volunteered to
do it. That too, shirtless.

980
00:58:54,423 --> 00:58:57,735
Want to find out who?
I won't give it away. Take a look.

981
00:59:02,196 --> 00:59:03,227
Karthik!

982
00:59:03,602 --> 00:59:06,204
You're sharing true love!
- Hey, no!

983
00:59:06,462 --> 00:59:08,040
That too, while you're shirtless.

984
00:59:08,532 --> 00:59:12,555
Great, man!
Karthik is here! Karthik is here! Go! Go!

985
00:59:12,688 --> 00:59:14,945
Everybody clap for Karthik. Come on.

986
00:59:22,649 --> 00:59:25,633
Finally, the wait is over
Karthik is here.

987
00:59:25,868 --> 00:59:27,626
I'll go first.

988
01:00:09,941 --> 01:00:11,371
Dad...
- How do you feel?

989
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:12,238
I'm okay.

990
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:15,261
What are we doing here?

991
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:18,230
It's nothing really
You fainted a while back.

992
01:00:18,598 --> 01:00:20,644
He'll be shocked to know that
he's been admitted for 2 days now.

993
01:00:20,669 --> 01:00:21,558
2 days?!

994
01:00:21,652 --> 01:00:23,340
Sir, your son is up.

995
01:00:25,566 --> 01:00:27,301
Yes. My son is awake.

996
01:00:27,379 --> 01:00:28,527
You'll be alright.

997
01:00:29,363 --> 01:00:31,238
You're feeling okay?
- Yeah. I'm totally fine.

998
01:00:32,535 --> 01:00:33,285
Give it to me.

999
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:36,269
Sanjay, how many times
do I have to tell you?

1000
01:00:36,386 --> 01:00:37,628
Don't you understand English?

1001
01:00:37,707 --> 01:00:39,160
[dialogue unclear]

1002
01:00:39,238 --> 01:00:40,629
Hey! What happened?

1003
01:00:40,699 --> 01:00:42,559
Uma gave him a shocker
at the shopping mall...

1004
01:00:42,676 --> 01:00:43,879
and he ended up in the hospital.

1005
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,160
Kudos to uncle.

1006
01:00:45,285 --> 01:00:48,496
He's been taking care of you since 2 days,
without any sleep.

1007
01:00:48,691 --> 01:00:50,347
He has a meeting in Pondicherry tomorrow.

1008
01:00:50,379 --> 01:00:52,519
His assistant is panicking
But, he's refusing to go.

1009
01:00:52,544 --> 01:00:53,426
He's on a call about that only.

1010
01:00:54,113 --> 01:00:56,199
You didn't have to cancel the
meeting for such a petty thing.

1011
01:00:56,566 --> 01:00:59,168
Anything to do with
you is a big deal for me.

1012
01:00:59,387 --> 01:01:00,543
I'm not a kid.

1013
01:01:00,629 --> 01:01:03,636
You may be all grown up
But, you're still my child.

1014
01:01:04,598 --> 01:01:05,941
Come on, Jerry.

1015
01:01:06,012 --> 01:01:08,480
I can't go, Tom.
- Jerry!

1016
01:01:09,004 --> 01:01:11,191
How can I leave you here?
- Shall I join you?

1017
01:01:11,309 --> 01:01:12,285
Really?!
- Hmm.

1018
01:01:12,363 --> 01:01:13,770
Sir, is your son going?

1019
01:01:13,918 --> 01:01:15,785
No. Both of us are.

1020
01:01:16,863 --> 01:01:19,785
Uma, we're going to the temple, remember?
But your're still in your bed.

1021
01:01:19,848 --> 01:01:22,378
I don't feel like going today.

1022
01:01:22,426 --> 01:01:23,434
What about the exam?

1023
01:01:24,293 --> 01:01:25,036
Exam!

1024
01:01:35,059 --> 01:01:35,965
Excuse me...
- Yes, sir.

1025
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:38,082
How long will dad's meeting take?
- No idea, sir.

1026
01:01:38,107 --> 01:01:39,184
Okay, you can go.

1027
01:01:46,122 --> 01:01:49,043
Karthik? Why is he calling now?

1028
01:01:49,153 --> 01:01:51,856
She's sick and she has an exam to attend.

1029
01:01:53,051 --> 01:01:55,325
Yes! Priyanka, you can handle this.

1030
01:01:56,653 --> 01:01:59,942
Hi, Karthik! It's me. Priyanka.

1031
01:02:00,004 --> 01:02:01,825
Hey! Why do you have Uma's phone?

1032
01:02:02,442 --> 01:02:04,692
What the hell! She's my friend first.

1033
01:02:04,879 --> 01:02:08,582
She's in a conference, Karthik.

1034
01:02:08,622 --> 01:02:11,161
Oh.
- So, what's up?

1035
01:02:11,197 --> 01:02:13,237
I have 2 more dates with her.

1036
01:02:13,307 --> 01:02:14,884
Thought I'd take her out today.
- Oh, no!

1037
01:02:16,229 --> 01:02:17,190
So sad!

1038
01:02:17,354 --> 01:02:19,963
She won't be free until 5 PM.

1039
01:02:19,994 --> 01:02:20,572
Yes!

1040
01:02:20,885 --> 01:02:22,744
Alright. I'll see her then.

1041
01:02:23,713 --> 01:02:25,869
He's such a leech.

1042
01:02:26,322 --> 01:02:29,291
You may be in the mood to wait.

1043
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:32,518
But, we aren't anywhere close by.

1044
01:02:32,713 --> 01:02:33,822
Uh-huh?

1045
01:02:33,908 --> 01:02:34,846
Where's the conference?

1046
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:37,315
Where?..

1047
01:02:37,729 --> 01:02:38,767
Uma...
- What?

1048
01:02:38,822 --> 01:02:40,268
Tell me some city's name.

1049
01:02:40,338 --> 01:02:42,666
Why?
- Just tell me. I'll explain later.

1050
01:02:43,346 --> 01:02:45,049
Pondicherry.
- Pondicherry.

1051
01:02:45,354 --> 01:02:46,713
Okay, don't mind me.

1052
01:02:46,791 --> 01:02:49,072
Pondicherry. Nice place.

1053
01:02:49,143 --> 01:02:51,299
We're in Pondicherry, Karthik!

1054
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:53,627
Karthik? Hello? Hello?

1055
01:02:55,931 --> 01:02:58,212
We're in Pondicherry, Karthik!
- Are you sure?

1056
01:02:58,275 --> 01:02:59,564
Sure.

1057
01:02:59,837 --> 01:03:04,696
Karthik, there's such cold
breeze here at the beach.

1058
01:03:05,572 --> 01:03:08,212
Are you at the beach road?

1059
01:03:08,306 --> 01:03:12,766
Obviously. Park Hotel is on the beach road.

1060
01:03:13,423 --> 01:03:15,165
What? Really?
When are you returning?

1061
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:19,337
Umm... 09:30 PM. It
will be midnight, Karthik.

1062
01:03:19,415 --> 01:03:21,314
Okay. I'll call you back.

1063
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:23,860
Thank god! I saved Uma.

1064
01:03:24,728 --> 01:03:26,322
Uma, I'm going to the temple.

1065
01:03:26,361 --> 01:03:27,236
Okay.

1066
01:03:30,572 --> 01:03:31,798
Jolt no. 1.

1067
01:03:32,681 --> 01:03:33,994
How did you exam go?

1068
01:03:34,204 --> 01:03:36,939
Yeah. 2 most strenous hours.

1069
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,017
Why did Karthik send a
selfie from Pondicherry?

1070
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,353
Pondicherry?! Selfie?!

1071
01:03:48,665 --> 01:03:50,189
Jolt no. 2.

1072
01:03:53,689 --> 01:03:55,369
I'm feeling uneasy.

1073
01:03:55,564 --> 01:03:57,548
He's adding to it with his selfies.

1074
01:03:58,369 --> 01:03:59,462
Where are you going?

1075
01:03:59,595 --> 01:04:01,564
I'm not going anywhere
You should go.

1076
01:04:01,589 --> 01:04:03,683
Where?
- Pondicherry.

1077
01:04:05,517 --> 01:04:07,009
You screwed me again?

1078
01:04:08,478 --> 01:04:09,603
Look, he's calling.

1079
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:10,587
Answer it.

1080
01:04:11,329 --> 01:04:14,626
I can't, I'll tell him the truth.

1081
01:04:14,869 --> 01:04:17,415
Go ahead. I'll tell him
that you asked me to lie.

1082
01:04:17,572 --> 01:04:19,142
Let's see who he'll believe.

1083
01:04:22,431 --> 01:04:25,361
Hi! Did you go to Pondicherry?

1084
01:04:25,478 --> 01:04:26,986
Wrong question.

1085
01:04:27,033 --> 01:04:28,728
You should ask 'Are
you also in Pondicherry?'

1086
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:30,064
Does that mean you lied?

1087
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:31,494
Aren't you in Pondicherry?

1088
01:04:32,048 --> 01:04:34,040
Umm... I have no reason to lie.

1089
01:04:34,165 --> 01:04:37,462
Maybe. But, I've never lied in my life.

1090
01:04:37,548 --> 01:04:38,986
Yeah. Yeah. I know.

1091
01:04:39,056 --> 01:04:41,220
Alright. You must be busy at the seminar.

1092
01:04:41,298 --> 01:04:42,572
See you in the evening.

1093
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:44,142
Okay.

1094
01:04:46,431 --> 01:04:48,431
Game starts now!

1095
01:04:48,603 --> 01:04:50,462
Get started
Your flight's waiting.

1096
01:04:50,986 --> 01:04:52,829
Rajeev Gandhi International Airport.

1097
01:04:55,314 --> 01:04:56,525
Let me call her now.

1098
01:05:01,892 --> 01:05:04,353
Well done! She boarded the flight.

1099
01:05:14,025 --> 01:05:15,908
Bro, please drive fast.

1100
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:36,697
Grandpa...It's not just in the midnight.

1101
01:05:37,025 --> 01:05:39,063
Girls don't have freedom
any time of the day.

1102
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:41,048
Hi.

1103
01:05:42,845 --> 01:05:43,650
It's you?!

1104
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,259
So, you finally made it come true.

1105
01:05:45,642 --> 01:05:46,619
What are you saying?

1106
01:05:46,728 --> 01:05:48,103
I mean, you're really here.

1107
01:05:49,126 --> 01:05:50,994
Alright. Let's start the date?

1108
01:05:51,298 --> 01:05:52,939
I should return on the 09:30 flight.

1109
01:05:52,978 --> 01:05:55,822
You seem to be excited than I am.

1110
01:05:56,009 --> 01:05:59,376
No way! Just want to get rid of you faster.

1111
01:05:59,533 --> 01:05:59,986
Hey!

1112
01:06:00,033 --> 01:06:02,548
Never try hard to get rid of a few things.

1113
01:06:02,822 --> 01:06:04,587
It will only make the bond stronger.

1114
01:06:04,892 --> 01:06:08,102
Especially with a guy like me,
be really careful.

1115
01:06:08,806 --> 01:06:11,876
I know
I should be really careful with you.

1116
01:06:12,056 --> 01:06:15,556
Uma, you know what girls see in the mirror?

1117
01:06:15,712 --> 01:06:16,673
A lie.

1118
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:19,126
What do guys see then?

1119
01:06:19,204 --> 01:06:21,275
Righteousness, Respect and Humanity.

1120
01:06:21,329 --> 01:06:23,985
Mr. Karthik, for your kind information...

1121
01:06:26,197 --> 01:06:30,259
When an X chromosome bonds with
another X chromosome, a female is born.

1122
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:34,111
When an X chromosome bonds
with a Y chromosome, a male is born.

1123
01:06:34,173 --> 01:06:36,384
Which means, we're
pure. You guys are dirty.

1124
01:06:37,572 --> 01:06:39,673
Chromosome is an underwear company, right?

1125
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:42,923
Hey, my bag!

1126
01:06:42,948 --> 01:06:45,673
He's getting away
Don't just stare. Go get him.

1127
01:06:46,033 --> 01:06:47,767
But you said something about X and sex.

1128
01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:51,150
Ah! I can't run now, Karthik.

1129
01:06:52,962 --> 01:06:54,837
Go!...
- Okay.

1130
01:07:41,861 --> 01:07:42,548
Hey!

1131
01:08:40,288 --> 01:08:42,530
Hey! Return the bag and free your guys.

1132
01:08:42,764 --> 01:08:44,061
You'll also get hurt otherwise.

1133
01:08:44,936 --> 01:08:45,585
Huh?

1134
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,139
My wallet, man!

1135
01:08:53,334 --> 01:08:53,998
Did you get it?

1136
01:08:54,553 --> 01:08:56,217
Oh, no! They emptied the bag.

1137
01:09:01,530 --> 01:09:03,538
Why is it raining so suddenly?

1138
01:09:03,717 --> 01:09:06,772
Didn't you watch the
weather forecast this morning?

1139
01:09:08,546 --> 01:09:10,202
See? My flight is also cancelled.

1140
01:09:14,077 --> 01:09:16,186
My flight also got cancelled.

1141
01:09:17,866 --> 01:09:20,217
Karthik, I need to use the loo immediately.

1142
01:09:20,452 --> 01:09:22,139
Please take me some place.

1143
01:09:24,061 --> 01:09:26,358
What the hell! All the stores are closed.

1144
01:09:28,342 --> 01:09:29,420
No power either.

1145
01:09:31,655 --> 01:09:33,335
Oh, my god!

1146
01:09:36,124 --> 01:09:36,904
One minute.

1147
01:09:37,046 --> 01:09:38,881
You stay here. I'll be right back.

1148
01:09:52,702 --> 01:09:54,874
Excuse me! Hello!

1149
01:09:56,342 --> 01:09:57,295
Who are you?

1150
01:09:58,819 --> 01:10:03,069
My wife is in that car.

1151
01:10:30,085 --> 01:10:33,405
If you don't mind,
I'll take you to a place, okay?

1152
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:44,820
Stay here. I'll just come.
- Hmm.

1153
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:46,273
Thank you, sir.

1154
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:47,516
Hi, Ramya.

1155
01:10:47,969 --> 01:10:50,523
Can I get a spare key to my room?
- Sorry, sir. Servers are down.

1156
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:53,296
I can't provide another
key as it's an electronic one.

1157
01:10:53,344 --> 01:10:55,180
Do you have another room available?
- No, sir.

1158
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,991
Uma, there's a problem with the key.

1159
01:10:58,209 --> 01:11:00,506
What do we do, Karthik?
- Don't worry. Give me 2 minutes.

1160
01:11:00,585 --> 01:11:01,617
I'll be right back.

1161
01:11:05,264 --> 01:11:06,295
Cheers!

1162
01:11:13,475 --> 01:11:15,882
My son's phone. I enjoy it very much.

1163
01:11:16,975 --> 01:11:17,967
Jerry, where are you?

1164
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:20,920
Jerry, give me the key.
- Key?

1165
01:11:21,006 --> 01:11:21,717
Yeah, key!

1166
01:11:24,382 --> 01:11:25,757
Park it and come.
- What?

1167
01:11:26,264 --> 01:11:27,116
Come on!

1168
01:11:27,327 --> 01:11:27,866
Uma!

1169
01:11:28,757 --> 01:11:29,811
You found a room?
- Yeah.

1170
01:11:29,836 --> 01:11:30,507
How?

1171
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:32,249
I'll explain later
Go and freshen up.

1172
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:33,091
Go.

1173
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:42,240
Friends?

1174
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:46,576
Friends.

1175
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:57,373
"It's a tale of two hearts"

1176
01:11:57,896 --> 01:12:00,849
"It makes my soul feel mesmerized"

1177
01:12:01,153 --> 01:12:06,627
"Maybe this is youth captivates you"

1178
01:12:07,971 --> 01:12:14,236
"I have never felt this way before"

1179
01:12:14,807 --> 01:12:20,408
"This day has blossomed like a miracle"

1180
01:12:21,604 --> 01:12:27,424
"I get to call you mine forever"

1181
01:12:28,417 --> 01:12:34,283
"Your presence doesn't leave my thought"

1182
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:55,688
"Let me hold you in tight embrace"

1183
01:12:55,942 --> 01:13:02,574
"Let romance sizzle and longer"

1184
01:13:04,497 --> 01:13:12,566
"Eyes catch glances that you shoot my way"

1185
01:13:12,655 --> 01:13:20,271
"My lips tremble as
nectar flows off of them"

1186
01:13:21,694 --> 01:13:28,943
"You've become the smile on my face"

1187
01:13:35,099 --> 01:13:41,747
"Are you really here or am I dreaming?"

1188
01:13:41,788 --> 01:13:44,967
"Why don't you listen to my plea?"

1189
01:13:45,288 --> 01:13:48,452
"Walk slowly towards me"

1190
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:52,311
"Slip into my arms and lose yourself"

1191
01:13:52,444 --> 01:13:57,428
"Let the shackles of love lock us together"

1192
01:14:01,171 --> 01:14:03,561
Jerry, you must be having
girls' clothes in your car.

1193
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,569
Give me something.

1194
01:14:04,749 --> 01:14:08,256
Those clothes we put on models for our ads.

1195
01:14:08,467 --> 01:14:09,499
Be clear.

1196
01:14:10,835 --> 01:14:12,131
What's cooking?

1197
01:14:12,796 --> 01:14:13,756
Nothing.

1198
01:14:14,006 --> 01:14:17,108
It's easy to say that
Hard to convince.

1199
01:14:17,568 --> 01:14:18,904
You taught me how to speak.

1200
01:14:18,991 --> 01:14:20,639
You never put me in a
spot to convince anybody.

1201
01:14:20,819 --> 01:14:22,038
Alright.

1202
01:14:22,202 --> 01:14:23,569
You're young.

1203
01:14:23,671 --> 01:14:25,350
Moreover, the weather is amazing.

1204
01:14:25,483 --> 01:14:28,318
Stop right there, dad. Let's go.
Come on. Come on.

1205
01:14:28,342 --> 01:14:30,295
You don't come
You're already wet.

1206
01:14:30,467 --> 01:14:32,748
Go and dry your hair.
- Alright. Come fast.

1207
01:14:35,249 --> 01:14:38,397
"It's a tale of two hearts"

1208
01:14:40,022 --> 01:14:41,655
Can I get your number?

1209
01:14:41,741 --> 01:14:42,546
405.

1210
01:14:42,631 --> 01:14:44,178
Uh-huh. Your phone number.

1211
01:14:44,296 --> 01:14:45,139
Phone...?

1212
01:14:56,006 --> 01:14:59,459
Jerry, we don't have a room
We should spend the night here.

1213
01:15:00,788 --> 01:15:02,428
Who says we don't have a room?

1214
01:15:02,647 --> 01:15:03,436
Give me 2 minutes.

1215
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:12,428
I want a room.
- No, sir.

1216
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:17,131
I want a room.
- No, sir.

1217
01:15:17,522 --> 01:15:20,467
I want a room.
- No...!

1218
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:24,046
Jerry! You go I'll...

1219
01:15:24,631 --> 01:15:25,311
Okay.

1220
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:32,897
Karthik?

1221
01:15:35,342 --> 01:15:37,288
Surprise! Hope you like it.

1222
01:15:42,444 --> 01:15:44,928
Uma! Freshen up
We'll grab dinner.

1223
01:15:48,866 --> 01:15:52,233
Jerry... I'll take a shower and come
Three of us will go get dinner.

1224
01:15:57,710 --> 01:15:59,881
I just gave her my number
She's calling already.

1225
01:15:59,967 --> 01:16:02,264
Yipee! I got lucky!

1226
01:16:09,646 --> 01:16:12,021
[singing romantically]

1227
01:16:18,897 --> 01:16:20,866
Tommy, I got an urgent call.

1228
01:16:21,147 --> 01:16:21,928
I have to go.

1229
01:16:21,999 --> 01:16:24,100
You guys get dinner, okay?
- What is it at this hour?

1230
01:16:24,131 --> 01:16:26,803
Meeting, man. Meeting.

1231
01:16:42,819 --> 01:16:43,616
Hey...

1232
01:16:44,272 --> 01:16:45,139
Did you freshen up?

1233
01:16:46,374 --> 01:16:48,467
Should I also freshen up?

1234
01:16:49,414 --> 01:16:51,312
Huh? It's your wish.
- Who wished for this?

1235
01:16:53,078 --> 01:16:54,359
You made a mistake, Karthi

1236
01:16:54,882 --> 01:16:56,632
A really big mistake.

1237
01:16:57,335 --> 01:16:58,906
My mom told me long back.

1238
01:16:59,179 --> 01:17:02,453
A man views a woman
according to the way she dresses.

1239
01:17:02,492 --> 01:17:07,061
Uma!
- Even if a girl smiles gently...

1240
01:17:07,328 --> 01:17:09,281
Guys claim that she's fallen hard for them.

1241
01:17:09,499 --> 01:17:11,999
We could come to a place out of compulsion.

1242
01:17:12,218 --> 01:17:14,539
But you come to the
conclusion that we're asking for it.

1243
01:17:14,734 --> 01:17:15,820
Times have changed.

1244
01:17:16,429 --> 01:17:18,905
But, a man's mindset is just as rotten.

1245
01:17:19,335 --> 01:17:22,530
I came this far to make a lie come true.

1246
01:17:23,562 --> 01:17:27,929
I thought you were genuine,
and wanted to be friends with you.

1247
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:29,164
But...

1248
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:36,147
You saw me as a bitch
and wanted to get laid, huh?

1249
01:17:36,492 --> 01:17:37,749
You said it'd be healthy dates.

1250
01:17:38,062 --> 01:17:41,233
I didn't expect it to be this healthy.

1251
01:17:41,484 --> 01:17:43,171
Uma, listen to me.
- What will you say?

1252
01:17:43,218 --> 01:17:46,030
You gave a long speech the other day.

1253
01:17:46,241 --> 01:17:47,061
What did you say?

1254
01:17:47,086 --> 01:17:50,570
It's a pure activity that
comes naturally to us?

1255
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:54,991
It definitely has a climax, huh?

1256
01:17:55,828 --> 01:17:57,546
Is that what success means?

1257
01:17:58,593 --> 01:18:01,257
What?! Fucking, is it?

1258
01:18:04,374 --> 01:18:05,960
For your kind information, Karthik...

1259
01:18:06,570 --> 01:18:09,093
Purity is the absence of this.

1260
01:18:09,906 --> 01:18:12,030
It's in not using this.

1261
01:18:13,374 --> 01:18:14,499
You know what?

1262
01:18:14,976 --> 01:18:17,421
Sex is not physical satisfaction.

1263
01:18:17,781 --> 01:18:19,367
It is a state of ecstacy.

1264
01:18:19,624 --> 01:18:20,710
For the soul.

1265
01:18:21,484 --> 01:18:24,531
People who value love making would know it.

1266
01:18:24,882 --> 01:18:26,475
Despos like you wouldn't.

1267
01:19:10,903 --> 01:19:11,731
Hello.

1268
01:19:29,671 --> 01:19:30,343
Dad?

1269
01:19:30,733 --> 01:19:31,366
Dad?

1270
01:19:32,015 --> 01:19:32,780
Dad!

1271
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:37,124
Dad!

1272
01:19:37,499 --> 01:19:38,147
Dad!

1273
01:19:38,437 --> 01:19:39,116
Dad!

1274
01:19:39,296 --> 01:19:40,897
Wake up, dad!

1275
01:19:42,983 --> 01:19:44,976
What is this, dad?
You're so fit.

1276
01:19:45,077 --> 01:19:47,085
This can't be true
What happened, dad?

1277
01:19:47,702 --> 01:19:48,647
I'm fine.

1278
01:19:49,725 --> 01:19:50,803
What's wrong with you?

1279
01:19:54,108 --> 01:19:55,054
You're fine, right?

1280
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:57,773
I'm fine.

1281
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,233
Get up
Let's get you out of here.

1282
01:20:11,202 --> 01:20:12,132
Hello, dad.

1283
01:20:12,163 --> 01:20:13,694
How are you, love?

1284
01:20:13,842 --> 01:20:15,014
I'm okay, dad.

1285
01:20:15,093 --> 01:20:18,147
Uma! What's wrong?
Is everything alright?

1286
01:20:21,632 --> 01:20:23,772
I wrote an exam that I didn't want to.

1287
01:20:24,874 --> 01:20:25,874
Now I failed.

1288
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,296
When you do something you
don't want to, this is the result.

1289
01:20:29,483 --> 01:20:31,483
You'll be happy only if
you do what you love.

1290
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:33,452
It's just an exam, right?
You can write it again.

1291
01:20:33,804 --> 01:20:34,444
Okay?

1292
01:20:35,421 --> 01:20:36,460
Take care, dear.

1293
01:20:36,593 --> 01:20:37,702
Okay, dad.

1294
01:20:40,905 --> 01:20:42,108
Umm... Actually...
- What is it, dad?

1295
01:20:42,167 --> 01:20:43,682
I need to tell you something.

1296
01:20:43,761 --> 01:20:45,979
You can tell me later, dad
First, let's get out of here.

1297
01:20:46,151 --> 01:20:47,886
I can't see you in this condition.

1298
01:20:47,933 --> 01:20:48,925
Come, let's go home.

1299
01:20:49,495 --> 01:20:51,659
Get the bill for Mr. Phani Bhupal.
- Okay.

1300
01:20:51,737 --> 01:20:53,190
I need to tell you something.

1301
01:20:54,448 --> 01:20:56,175
Are you getting discharged?
- Yes.

1302
01:20:56,456 --> 01:20:57,253
Just a minute.

1303
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:05,714
Here's your baby.

1304
01:21:06,261 --> 01:21:07,823
Oh, no. I'm not married.

1305
01:21:08,057 --> 01:21:09,689
He's your father, right?
- Yeah.

1306
01:21:09,753 --> 01:21:11,291
This is his daughter.
- What?!

1307
01:21:16,096 --> 01:21:16,784
What?

1308
01:21:18,728 --> 01:21:20,759
Last night...
- Last night...

1309
01:21:20,924 --> 01:21:22,682
While you were freshening up...

1310
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:26,228
While I was freshening up...
- I... got a call...

1311
01:21:26,494 --> 01:21:27,393
You got a call...

1312
01:21:27,418 --> 01:21:29,408
I stepped out...

1313
01:21:29,455 --> 01:21:30,612
You stepped out...

1314
01:21:30,637 --> 01:21:31,651
And I had a baby.

1315
01:21:32,861 --> 01:21:35,547
I told you the zist of it.

1316
01:21:35,596 --> 01:21:37,283
You said you'd find me a mother.

1317
01:21:37,697 --> 01:21:39,080
But, you gave me a sister.

1318
01:21:39,244 --> 01:21:41,744
What can I do?
- You're the condom dealer for both the States.

1319
01:21:43,221 --> 01:21:44,307
Couldn't you use one?

1320
01:21:45,315 --> 01:21:46,651
It could've torn.

1321
01:21:47,096 --> 01:21:47,884
Have you gone mad?

1322
01:21:47,931 --> 01:21:50,400
Are you ever serious in life?
How could you do this?

1323
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:51,206
I'm asking you!

1324
01:22:58,683 --> 01:23:01,042
[Indian National Anthem playing]

1325
01:24:15,758 --> 01:24:19,400
Chitti! Go along with that cry-face
I will park the car and come.

1326
01:24:23,549 --> 01:24:24,321
Karthik!

1327
01:24:24,705 --> 01:24:25,627
Karthik?

1328
01:24:27,861 --> 01:24:30,095
My ex-husband’s name is Karthik.

1329
01:24:30,166 --> 01:24:31,361
My name is Fani Bhoopal

1330
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:33,041
Sir! Can you wait for some time?

1331
01:24:33,705 --> 01:24:34,532
Nonsense!

1332
01:24:34,924 --> 01:24:36,439
People do not behave like an elder.
- Excuse me.

1333
01:24:36,689 --> 01:24:37,955
Yes, Karthik.

1334
01:24:38,056 --> 01:24:40,931
He is my father.
- Oh! I am so sorry, sir.

1335
01:24:41,134 --> 01:24:43,728
Karthik! Your table number is 6!
- Thank you.

1336
01:24:45,424 --> 01:24:46,478
Karthik.

1337
01:24:49,127 --> 01:24:51,150
Excuse me, bro.
- Can I have a seat?

1338
01:24:51,533 --> 01:24:52,158
Hmm.

1339
01:24:54,017 --> 01:24:57,657
Oh! Is she your daughter?
She looks exactly like you.

1340
01:24:59,938 --> 01:25:01,689
Can’t you see any of his features?

1341
01:25:02,064 --> 01:25:03,806
That guy?
- I am her father.

1342
01:25:03,869 --> 01:25:04,713
Oh!

1343
01:25:04,791 --> 01:25:08,986
He is your father and grandpa of this girl.

1344
01:25:09,142 --> 01:25:11,095
So, she might look like him too.

1345
01:25:11,267 --> 01:25:13,314
But, believe me
She looks exactly like you.

1346
01:25:13,377 --> 01:25:14,384
Hello.

1347
01:25:15,408 --> 01:25:17,368
Can’t you see my matching features?

1348
01:25:17,627 --> 01:25:19,080
Something is fishy!

1349
01:25:20,205 --> 01:25:23,189
Why do you care about features, sir?
I will find another table. - Get lost.

1350
01:25:29,439 --> 01:25:30,611
What should I do?

1351
01:25:35,416 --> 01:25:37,299
It is working fine, uncle.

1352
01:25:38,127 --> 01:25:40,392
I guess that is because
servicing is done regularly.

1353
01:25:41,634 --> 01:25:46,165
Ever Spiderman’s
strengths fade away with age.

1354
01:25:47,009 --> 01:25:50,704
You are very strong
even after turning 60 years.

1355
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:56,791
Hey, dad! Are you feeling shy?

1356
01:25:57,634 --> 01:25:58,282
Hey…

1357
01:25:58,845 --> 01:25:59,923
Hey…

1358
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:03,157
Hey…
- I am feeling shy.

1359
01:26:03,182 --> 01:26:05,729
Why are you feeling shy?
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1360
01:26:07,002 --> 01:26:10,681
I am embarrassed
Is it funny for you?

1361
01:26:13,409 --> 01:26:14,190
Oh!

1362
01:26:18,581 --> 01:26:21,862
I thought this would happen
Even Mr. Murthy’s son was like this.

1363
01:26:21,887 --> 01:26:26,689
He went on a tour and came
back with a dancer woman.

1364
01:26:26,737 --> 01:26:28,987
This man came back with a baby.

1365
01:26:29,252 --> 01:26:31,120
The crazy bull should be chained.

1366
01:26:31,159 --> 01:26:32,870
He should get his grown-up son married.

1367
01:26:32,901 --> 01:26:37,330
Otherwise, they might make mistakes.

1368
01:26:38,198 --> 01:26:40,807
They should at least
think about society once.

1369
01:26:40,987 --> 01:26:43,510
What’s the use of being an elder?

1370
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:46,409
Children learn from their parents.

1371
01:26:46,565 --> 01:26:49,072
All is well! Who is she referring to?

1372
01:26:49,135 --> 01:26:51,158
Simple! She referred to uncle and Karthik.

1373
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:52,244
What are we then?

1374
01:26:52,331 --> 01:26:54,502
Where is your daughter-in-law?
I cannot see her.

1375
01:26:54,588 --> 01:26:55,916
Why should I even care?

1376
01:26:55,987 --> 01:26:58,815
Try to nurture her properly unlike you.

1377
01:26:58,909 --> 01:27:00,651
Listen! I placed snacks there.

1378
01:27:02,588 --> 01:27:03,166
Gosh!

1379
01:27:03,581 --> 01:27:06,776
See! People think that
Chitti is my daughter.

1380
01:27:07,088 --> 01:27:09,479
Imagine what they would say if
they find out that you are her father.

1381
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:12,728
I am ashamed, Jerry.
- What is it?

1382
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:15,229
What did I do that makes you feel ashamed?
I became your father.

1383
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:16,752
Likewise, I am her father too.

1384
01:27:16,784 --> 01:27:18,658
Your mothers are different
but your father is the same.

1385
01:27:19,127 --> 01:27:21,447
The problem is not with Chitti, Jerry
It is your age.

1386
01:27:25,448 --> 01:27:26,049
Yes.

1387
01:27:26,385 --> 01:27:27,534
I became her father at the age of 60!

1388
01:27:28,182 --> 01:27:29,135
What’s the issue here?

1389
01:27:29,674 --> 01:27:32,033
Why are you worried about others?
Who are they?

1390
01:27:32,166 --> 01:27:33,268
Are you referring to these guys?

1391
01:27:33,971 --> 01:27:37,143
When should we enjoy our life if
we keep thinking about society?

1392
01:27:37,432 --> 01:27:40,143
I did not care about society till now
I survived and care only about you.

1393
01:27:41,299 --> 01:27:42,674
Tell me...Do you not like it?

1394
01:27:43,268 --> 01:27:45,565
Tell me. Do you not like it?

1395
01:27:45,651 --> 01:27:47,448
I will go away from the
house if you do not like it.

1396
01:27:47,534 --> 01:27:49,534
But, stop talking about society.

1397
01:27:50,299 --> 01:27:52,401
Okay, go Let’s see how far you can go.

1398
01:27:52,737 --> 01:27:53,588
Are you threatening me?

1399
01:27:53,721 --> 01:27:55,502
I can go to Singapore or Thailand.

1400
01:27:55,573 --> 01:27:57,768
I guess Karthik might have
sisters and brothers elsewhere.

1401
01:27:58,745 --> 01:27:59,956
I heard you.

1402
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:02,307
I don’t want to be your friend anymore
I will leave.

1403
01:28:02,534 --> 01:28:04,088
Do not stop me
I warn you!

1404
01:28:04,830 --> 01:28:05,924
No one is stopping me, right?

1405
01:28:05,971 --> 01:28:07,565
No one will stop you. Go!
- I know, No one can stop me.

1406
01:28:07,604 --> 01:28:12,432
I will leave…I will go away.

1407
01:28:14,073 --> 01:28:15,846
What’s that noise as if there is an alien?

1408
01:28:18,104 --> 01:28:19,393
It is not an alien.

1409
01:28:20,674 --> 01:28:21,916
Member of the house it is!

1410
01:28:23,768 --> 01:28:25,127
What is she doing?

1411
01:28:25,409 --> 01:28:28,432
I guess she is crying.

1412
01:28:28,725 --> 01:28:32,342
Girls make us cry but never cries, right?

1413
01:28:32,866 --> 01:28:33,983
She is a baby.

1414
01:28:34,022 --> 01:28:35,866
What should we do to make her stop crying?

1415
01:28:36,178 --> 01:28:37,600
Will she stop if
we ask her to stop?

1416
01:28:38,272 --> 01:28:39,272
Hey! Stop.

1417
01:28:44,686 --> 01:28:47,647
Let’s try another way this time.

1418
01:28:47,678 --> 01:28:48,116
Okay.

1419
01:28:48,559 --> 01:28:49,177
Hey!

1420
01:28:49,615 --> 01:28:50,396
Cry.

1421
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:55,388
What should we do now?

1422
01:28:55,513 --> 01:28:58,341
Let’s think about a solution
Okay.

1423
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:08,353
Who is it, then?

1424
01:29:11,845 --> 01:29:13,283
I will get vegetables.

1425
01:29:15,071 --> 01:29:16,243
Who will remove that?

1426
01:29:16,337 --> 01:29:17,188
Greetings!

1427
01:29:17,470 --> 01:29:20,017
Let us find out how to
remove a baby’s diaper.

1428
01:29:21,244 --> 01:29:24,642
Do not pull it forcibly.

1429
01:29:24,845 --> 01:29:29,548
The diaper looks delicate
But, it is dangerous.

1430
01:29:29,689 --> 01:29:30,330
Gosh!

1431
01:29:30,392 --> 01:29:32,868
You might question how to open it?

1432
01:29:32,955 --> 01:29:35,392
Let me get to the point.

1433
01:29:36,009 --> 01:29:37,134
Let's talk about the diaper.

1434
01:29:37,275 --> 01:29:40,923
Firstly, you should inhale deeply.

1435
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:44,181
Why should we inhale to do this?

1436
01:29:44,290 --> 01:29:46,861
Do not doubt.

1437
01:29:49,001 --> 01:29:52,478
Hold your breath without exhaling.

1438
01:29:52,533 --> 01:29:54,994
Why is he teaching us yoga
instead of telling us about the diaper?

1439
01:29:56,439 --> 01:29:57,165
Hey!

1440
01:29:57,501 --> 01:29:58,876
Stay like that.

1441
01:29:59,212 --> 01:30:01,524
Do not open yet.

1442
01:30:01,767 --> 01:30:03,897
Peel it like a banana.

1443
01:30:04,015 --> 01:30:05,671
Why is he talking about food?

1444
01:30:05,710 --> 01:30:08,812
If you open it too fast,
it would be a mess.

1445
01:30:09,609 --> 01:30:11,398
Hey! We might die if we listen to him.

1446
01:30:11,913 --> 01:30:14,405
I will open it...
- Hey! No.

1447
01:30:14,468 --> 01:30:16,842
Listen to me,
No, man!

1448
01:30:16,881 --> 01:30:18,108
No…

1449
01:30:26,226 --> 01:30:29,030
Let’s learn how to clean
your face in the next episode.

1450
01:30:48,671 --> 01:30:50,929
Oh no! Why are you drinking this?

1451
01:30:50,991 --> 01:30:52,530
Why? Can I not?

1452
01:30:52,585 --> 01:30:54,570
Why not? You can have it.

1453
01:30:54,804 --> 01:30:56,491
I mean, why?

1454
01:30:57,593 --> 01:30:58,476
I am depressed.

1455
01:30:58,679 --> 01:31:01,062
You came in a luxurious car
Why would you be in depression?

1456
01:31:01,382 --> 01:31:02,445
Son stroke!

1457
01:31:02,687 --> 01:31:05,030
He means to say Sunstroke.

1458
01:31:05,249 --> 01:31:07,093
No. Son stroke!
- Did he beat you?

1459
01:31:07,171 --> 01:31:08,827
He drove me away.
- Why?

1460
01:31:09,405 --> 01:31:10,585
Because a baby was born!

1461
01:31:10,616 --> 01:31:11,921
That’s right.

1462
01:31:11,946 --> 01:31:15,874
They will drive us away
once they give birth to babies.

1463
01:31:16,124 --> 01:31:17,570
I am the father of
the baby. Not him.

1464
01:31:18,999 --> 01:31:20,155
At this age?

1465
01:31:20,202 --> 01:31:21,124
What should I do?

1466
01:31:21,327 --> 01:31:22,374
What should I do?

1467
01:31:22,405 --> 01:31:23,640
At this age?

1468
01:31:32,437 --> 01:31:36,741
“Our expectations are wrong
But we fail to guess what happens”

1469
01:31:36,766 --> 01:31:40,801
“What should I do? I am your dad”

1470
01:31:41,067 --> 01:31:45,192
“Things we like might fade away
But whatever comes your way is yours”

1471
01:31:45,488 --> 01:31:49,895
“What should I do? I am your dad”

1472
01:31:49,927 --> 01:31:53,957
“The age is 60 and strength weakens”

1473
01:31:54,270 --> 01:31:58,364
“He had a baby with ease back then”

1474
01:31:58,630 --> 01:32:02,645
“He is not even 20 but nothing happened”

1475
01:32:02,989 --> 01:32:07,317
“But, a girl was flattered
and a baby showed up”

1476
01:32:07,349 --> 01:32:11,622
“What should I do?
Come on, everybody”

1477
01:32:11,677 --> 01:32:16,051
“What should I do? I am your dad”

1478
01:32:16,161 --> 01:32:20,310
“What should I do? I am your dad”

1479
01:32:20,481 --> 01:32:24,817
“I was waiting in the
portico on a rainy night”

1480
01:32:24,872 --> 01:32:29,114
“She suddenly came and invited me in”

1481
01:32:29,224 --> 01:32:33,489
“A lizard showed up and
she hugged me due to fear”

1482
01:32:33,528 --> 01:32:37,879
“Faces got overlapped in the background
With flowers spread all over”

1483
01:32:37,958 --> 01:32:39,340
“What should I do?”

1484
01:32:39,365 --> 01:32:42,504
"Tell me now, olden, golden, daddy love!"

1485
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:46,801
“What should I do? I am your dad”

1486
01:32:46,911 --> 01:32:51,200
“What should I do? I am your dad”

1487
01:32:51,786 --> 01:32:55,825
He did everything and is
now asking about what to do?

1488
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:57,145
Crazy person!

1489
01:32:57,170 --> 01:32:59,028
"My name is Fani Bhoopal!”

1490
01:32:59,067 --> 01:33:01,380
“I am sweet like Laddu Gopal”

1491
01:33:01,435 --> 01:33:05,879
“My son is Karthik
He is my best friend”

1492
01:33:05,942 --> 01:33:10,207
“I loved him so much
I cared about him a lot”

1493
01:33:10,302 --> 01:33:14,622
“He asked for mother
and I went with a baby”

1494
01:33:14,647 --> 01:33:18,950
“What should I do?
Come on, everybody”

1495
01:33:19,005 --> 01:33:27,036
“What should I do? I am your dad”

1496
01:33:27,138 --> 01:33:29,489
Okay. You are the father!
- Do you think it is easy?

1497
01:33:29,739 --> 01:33:31,872
Can you have a baby at this age?

1498
01:33:31,897 --> 01:33:33,685
You are strong, man!

1499
01:33:37,614 --> 01:33:38,395
Hey!

1500
01:33:38,747 --> 01:33:40,497
What is this?
We want some safety.

1501
01:33:41,817 --> 01:33:42,833
Oh my gosh!

1502
01:33:45,630 --> 01:33:47,551
Why is she crying again?
- I don’t know, dude.

1503
01:33:47,630 --> 01:33:48,778
Let us ask Alexa.

1504
01:33:50,005 --> 01:33:51,177
Take it out first.

1505
01:33:51,505 --> 01:33:52,489
Alexa.
- Yes.

1506
01:33:52,514 --> 01:33:54,583
Why does an 8-month baby cry at 5 pm?

1507
01:33:54,716 --> 01:33:56,005
Her stomach must be upset.

1508
01:33:56,153 --> 01:33:57,645
No chance! She unloaded just now.

1509
01:33:58,020 --> 01:33:59,200
She must be hungry.

1510
01:33:59,591 --> 01:34:00,645
Chances are there.

1511
01:34:02,614 --> 01:34:05,364
You look like a grown-up
Don’t you know what babies eat?

1512
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:06,520
I know.

1513
01:34:07,286 --> 01:34:09,395
Babies drink milk, you fool.
- Oh!

1514
01:34:10,864 --> 01:34:12,348
I found it.
- I found it.

1515
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:13,427
I found it too.

1516
01:34:13,583 --> 01:34:14,755
Yes.
- Yes.

1517
01:34:59,442 --> 01:35:01,388
Hey! Turn off the lights.

1518
01:35:03,137 --> 01:35:05,707
That's the sun. Not lights.

1519
01:35:05,731 --> 01:35:07,333
Why is he so bright?

1520
01:35:07,358 --> 01:35:08,944
Close the curtains at least.

1521
01:35:19,648 --> 01:35:22,186
You disturbed my dream.

1522
01:35:22,218 --> 01:35:23,030
You’re done.

1523
01:35:24,257 --> 01:35:25,679
Do not make noise
The baby might wake up.

1524
01:35:25,734 --> 01:35:27,390
Hello, sir! She is awake.

1525
01:35:30,437 --> 01:35:31,616
Jerry.

1526
01:35:33,054 --> 01:35:34,327
Jerry! Where are you?

1527
01:35:34,452 --> 01:35:36,186
I am at a place far from you.

1528
01:35:36,210 --> 01:35:37,406
Damn! Stop it.

1529
01:35:37,468 --> 01:35:39,140
You care about others, right?

1530
01:35:39,312 --> 01:35:41,475
I want to live the way I want to.
- No, Jerry.

1531
01:35:41,554 --> 01:35:43,718
When will you come back?
- I will come if you apologize.

1532
01:35:43,743 --> 01:35:45,976
You want me to apologize, right?
Sorry…sorry!

1533
01:35:46,187 --> 01:35:47,531
Where are you?
- London.

1534
01:35:47,725 --> 01:35:49,046
London?
- Yeah.

1535
01:35:49,499 --> 01:35:52,257
Didn’t you just say you are in London?
- London!

1536
01:36:00,531 --> 01:36:01,804
Love you, tom.

1537
01:36:02,241 --> 01:36:04,671
Hey! Take care of Chitti
We'll go out for some time.

1538
01:36:04,702 --> 01:36:05,398
Okay.

1539
01:36:07,765 --> 01:36:08,835
Chitti?

1540
01:36:09,093 --> 01:36:11,062
What are you doing alone?

1541
01:36:11,593 --> 01:36:12,804
Stop thinking much.

1542
01:36:12,906 --> 01:36:16,835
We use delete and refresh
buttons to clear the bugs in software.

1543
01:36:16,968 --> 01:36:19,929
Likewise, we should use our minds.

1544
01:36:19,984 --> 01:36:22,288
Let’s go somewhere and chill.

1545
01:36:22,359 --> 01:36:24,999
Let us take a break for you. Come.

1546
01:36:25,054 --> 01:36:26,132
Let’s go…

1547
01:36:28,225 --> 01:36:29,983
Why don’t you shop for Chitti as a brother?

1548
01:36:31,514 --> 01:36:33,732
I mean let's make it one in one.

1549
01:36:33,865 --> 01:36:34,678
Oh!

1550
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:39,279
You have to do your
tasks even if I am there.

1551
01:36:40,084 --> 01:36:41,654
That’s how I made Chitti.

1552
01:36:42,146 --> 01:36:43,170
Yeah, right!

1553
01:36:43,232 --> 01:36:45,217
You don’t take safety and make babies.

1554
01:36:45,357 --> 01:36:48,451
Don’t you feel responsible?
- Okay, Safety my foot!

1555
01:36:48,476 --> 01:36:49,990
You take what you want
I will check here.

1556
01:36:52,295 --> 01:36:53,029
Excuse me.

1557
01:36:53,092 --> 01:36:54,248
Tell me, sir.
- I need a diaper.

1558
01:36:54,467 --> 01:36:55,264
What’s the size?

1559
01:36:56,051 --> 01:36:57,715
Size?

1560
01:36:57,988 --> 01:36:58,770
This big!

1561
01:36:59,363 --> 01:37:01,410
Oh no! You should not say that, sir.

1562
01:37:01,488 --> 01:37:03,223
There are sizes for it.

1563
01:37:04,426 --> 01:37:05,066
This big!

1564
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:07,465
The size you said earlier is 36.

1565
01:37:07,496 --> 01:37:08,832
I guess size 18 will be fine.

1566
01:37:09,652 --> 01:37:11,159
Correct...Sorry.

1567
01:37:12,605 --> 01:37:13,324
Right.

1568
01:37:13,511 --> 01:37:14,269
Thanks.

1569
01:37:42,418 --> 01:37:43,753
Can you give me a nipple?

1570
01:37:43,778 --> 01:37:44,683
What do you mean?

1571
01:37:45,371 --> 01:37:47,379
I mean I want this.

1572
01:37:48,347 --> 01:37:50,160
Oh! That one? Take it.

1573
01:37:50,971 --> 01:37:52,425
Will this size be enough?

1574
01:37:52,605 --> 01:37:54,730
Whom are you buying it for?
- For a One-year-old baby!

1575
01:37:54,995 --> 01:37:56,839
That should be enough for a baby.
- Oh!

1576
01:37:57,245 --> 01:37:58,721
Will they sell it for adults too?

1577
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:01,683
Hey! It seems they sell it for adults too.

1578
01:38:01,933 --> 01:38:04,230
Jerry! Shall we take two of these?

1579
01:38:04,285 --> 01:38:05,879
What’s this for?
- For this!

1580
01:38:05,996 --> 01:38:08,206
Not like that!
- You stay quiet. It won’t be much.

1581
01:38:08,254 --> 01:38:10,902
It will be too much.
- Pour some more.

1582
01:38:10,927 --> 01:38:11,996
Take off your hand.

1583
01:38:13,965 --> 01:38:14,925
Test it.

1584
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:16,160
Is it good?

1585
01:38:17,761 --> 01:38:19,019
It is good.
- Jerry! Check Chitti!

1586
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:21,496
Oh! Chitti
I will do that…

1587
01:38:26,605 --> 01:38:32,011
“Blossomed like a flower”

1588
01:38:34,293 --> 01:38:39,386
“Flies like a bird”

1589
01:38:42,011 --> 01:38:48,745
“Drips like a droplet”

1590
01:38:49,761 --> 01:38:56,230
“Moves like a fish”

1591
01:38:57,527 --> 01:39:01,316
“Touched like a lullaby”

1592
01:39:01,425 --> 01:39:05,238
“My heart feels pampered”

1593
01:39:05,293 --> 01:39:09,112
"Oh, my darling! She stole my heart"

1594
01:39:09,136 --> 01:39:12,027
“She’s entangled to me”

1595
01:39:13,011 --> 01:39:14,917
“She holds my hand”

1596
01:39:14,965 --> 01:39:20,370
“She brings out a baby in me with her play”

1597
01:39:24,847 --> 01:39:25,550
Chitti.

1598
01:39:25,629 --> 01:39:28,355
I am too busy with you
These calls are disturbing me.

1599
01:39:28,465 --> 01:39:29,246
What should I do?

1600
01:39:30,636 --> 01:39:31,254
Rosie!

1601
01:39:32,058 --> 01:39:36,066
I don’t know what action you take but I
shouldn’t get any more calls from this number.

1602
01:39:36,091 --> 01:39:37,489
But, sir?
- Chitti!

1603
01:39:38,152 --> 01:39:39,074
Forever!

1604
01:39:39,113 --> 01:39:42,785
"Oh, my darling! She stole my heart"

1605
01:39:42,941 --> 01:39:46,331
“She’s entangled to me”

1606
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:48,698
“She holds my hand”

1607
01:39:48,793 --> 01:39:53,870
“She brings out a baby in me with her play”

1608
01:39:56,730 --> 01:39:57,840
Chitti.

1609
01:39:59,019 --> 01:40:00,824
Do you know who I am?

1610
01:40:01,175 --> 01:40:02,535
I am your father.

1611
01:40:03,183 --> 01:40:04,011
Say it.

1612
01:40:04,730 --> 01:40:05,949
Dada!

1613
01:40:06,504 --> 01:40:11,284
My life aged while trying
to achieve a lot of things.

1614
01:40:12,410 --> 01:40:17,878
Now I know what I lost.

1615
01:40:18,175 --> 01:40:24,308
I missed all the fun I should
have had with your brother Karthik.

1616
01:40:25,433 --> 01:40:27,027
But, I will not miss it this time.

1617
01:40:28,605 --> 01:40:30,230
Your smile and crawling!

1618
01:40:30,855 --> 01:40:32,480
Your voice and babbling!

1619
01:40:33,027 --> 01:40:34,636
I won’t miss anything.

1620
01:40:35,082 --> 01:40:37,722
Jerry! Stop chatting
You are getting late to catch the flight.

1621
01:40:38,183 --> 01:40:40,495
Hello, What is it?
Why are you packing our clothes?

1622
01:40:41,261 --> 01:40:43,433
We’re getting late to
catch the flight, right?

1623
01:40:43,589 --> 01:40:46,441
So, isn’t this a business trip?

1624
01:40:46,957 --> 01:40:49,847
It is a business trip
but also a family trip.

1625
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:51,619
Family business!
Why are you taking off Chitti’s things?

1626
01:40:51,659 --> 01:40:53,457
What should Chitti and I do
when you handle the business?

1627
01:40:53,831 --> 01:40:57,433
Hey! How can I go without Chitti?
I cannot go without Chitti.

1628
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:58,753
Who will take care of her as I do?
- No.

1629
01:40:58,785 --> 01:41:01,081
I will take care of her.
- Who will take care of you?

1630
01:41:01,112 --> 01:41:03,417
First, you move..Go…
- How will you take care of Chitti?

1631
01:41:04,183 --> 01:41:07,371
Chitti! Did you get up?

1632
01:41:09,027 --> 01:41:11,082
Come. I will feed you now.

1633
01:41:14,042 --> 01:41:14,901
Chitti.

1634
01:41:19,168 --> 01:41:20,730
Milk! It is milk time.

1635
01:41:20,808 --> 01:41:21,449
Hold it.

1636
01:41:21,941 --> 01:41:23,597
Not the phone
Hold the milk bottle.

1637
01:41:23,683 --> 01:41:24,386
Give me the phone.

1638
01:41:26,996 --> 01:41:28,855
Uma! You don’t know, right?

1639
01:41:29,394 --> 01:41:31,918
I just met her and she disappeared.

1640
01:41:32,933 --> 01:41:34,878
What should I do?

1641
01:41:36,558 --> 01:41:37,511
It is not wrong, right?

1642
01:41:39,049 --> 01:41:40,142
You have milk.

1643
01:41:40,502 --> 01:41:41,393
I will call her.

1644
01:41:41,541 --> 01:41:42,205
Okay?

1645
01:41:42,354 --> 01:41:44,088
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

1646
01:42:22,783 --> 01:42:23,979
Good morning.

1647
01:42:25,533 --> 01:42:27,385
Chitti! Did you not have milk?

1648
01:42:27,805 --> 01:42:29,876
You are being a cranky kid.

1649
01:42:31,346 --> 01:42:31,955
Chitti…

1650
01:42:32,682 --> 01:42:33,260
Chitti…

1651
01:42:34,135 --> 01:42:34,760
Chitti…

1652
01:42:35,111 --> 01:42:35,814
Chitti…

1653
01:42:38,830 --> 01:42:39,979
Hey! Get up.

1654
01:42:41,033 --> 01:42:41,549
Chitti.

1655
01:42:48,861 --> 01:42:49,596
Doctor!

1656
01:42:49,759 --> 01:42:51,391
You will finally get freedom.

1657
01:42:51,643 --> 01:42:52,705
What do you mean, doctor?

1658
01:42:52,807 --> 01:42:54,236
Be it parents, brothers, or sisters!

1659
01:42:54,408 --> 01:42:57,736
When a girl puts some conditions,
society considers it as responsibility.

1660
01:42:57,869 --> 01:43:00,939
But husband’s conditions
are considered sadism.

1661
01:43:01,572 --> 01:43:05,400
Husbands try to be
submissive to their wives.

1662
01:43:06,087 --> 01:43:08,095
What is it, doctor?
Is it your personal experience?

1663
01:43:08,986 --> 01:43:10,221
Something like that!

1664
01:43:19,273 --> 01:43:20,601
What is he doing here?

1665
01:43:21,469 --> 01:43:23,172
Is he following me?

1666
01:43:24,963 --> 01:43:26,947
Did he come to say sorry?

1667
01:43:28,103 --> 01:43:29,946
Why should I accept his sorry?

1668
01:43:30,869 --> 01:43:31,705
Who cares!

1669
01:43:51,939 --> 01:43:53,189
I cannot take it.

1670
01:43:55,111 --> 01:43:59,767
It is hard to digest when we
see our loved ones going away.

1671
01:44:00,783 --> 01:44:02,189
I get it now.

1672
01:44:03,307 --> 01:44:04,807
It is my mistake.

1673
01:44:05,627 --> 01:44:07,572
That is why I am suffering now.

1674
01:44:24,195 --> 01:44:25,570
You are the baby's father, right?

1675
01:44:25,812 --> 01:44:26,445
Baby?

1676
01:44:27,383 --> 01:44:27,992
Father?

1677
01:44:28,133 --> 01:44:28,781
Please, dear.

1678
01:44:29,914 --> 01:44:30,374
Chitti.

1679
01:44:31,304 --> 01:44:32,625
Dear.
- I will check. Come.

1680
01:44:42,992 --> 01:44:43,656
Chitti.

1681
01:44:43,804 --> 01:44:46,125
She got dehydrated
because of too much crying.

1682
01:44:46,344 --> 01:44:47,234
She will be okay.

1683
01:44:47,508 --> 01:44:49,875
Can I see her?
- Hmm.

1684
01:44:56,195 --> 01:44:58,422
I always wanted a mother.

1685
01:44:59,414 --> 01:45:02,625
That’s why I wanted to
foster you like a mother.

1686
01:45:04,008 --> 01:45:06,976
Mom's care, love, and protection!

1687
01:45:08,476 --> 01:45:09,812
I could not give you any of that.

1688
01:45:10,976 --> 01:45:12,179
This will not happen again.

1689
01:45:13,453 --> 01:45:14,929
I will not repeat this.

1690
01:45:15,422 --> 01:45:16,726
I will not repeat this.

1691
01:45:18,726 --> 01:45:19,726
I promise, Chitti.

1692
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:25,979
Karthik! Shall we have coffee?

1693
01:45:35,706 --> 01:45:39,674
I see a father in you now, not a flirt.

1694
01:45:40,347 --> 01:45:41,869
What? I am not yet a father.

1695
01:45:42,175 --> 01:45:44,347
Oh! Are you still a flirt?

1696
01:45:45,370 --> 01:45:46,737
Come on, Uma.

1697
01:45:46,917 --> 01:45:47,815
Who is that baby then?

1698
01:45:57,456 --> 01:45:58,425
I am sorry.

1699
01:46:02,057 --> 01:46:03,909
You are good at flirting.

1700
01:46:04,190 --> 01:46:06,518
Your father is much worse than you.

1701
01:46:06,573 --> 01:46:08,549
Please stop it.

1702
01:46:08,659 --> 01:46:09,643
I have a doubt.

1703
01:46:09,956 --> 01:46:12,682
Isn’t your father as cautious as you?

1704
01:46:12,792 --> 01:46:15,752
Like me? What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

1705
01:46:15,878 --> 01:46:18,401
You got ready with it
back in the hotel that day.

1706
01:46:18,564 --> 01:46:19,454
Did you forget?

1707
01:46:20,259 --> 01:46:20,798
Hmm.

1708
01:46:22,189 --> 01:46:23,540
Do you have a pen?
- Hmm.

1709
01:46:31,157 --> 01:46:32,665
What is this?
- 9!

1710
01:46:33,077 --> 01:46:34,219
I wrote 6.

1711
01:46:38,197 --> 01:46:41,626
See! I see something and
you get something else in mind.

1712
01:46:42,056 --> 01:46:44,696
You thought I got them that day.

1713
01:46:45,197 --> 01:46:47,447
You did not even ask me if I got them.

1714
01:46:47,634 --> 01:46:49,775
All you can see could be a lie.

1715
01:46:50,095 --> 01:46:52,259
Listen to your heart and know the truth.

1716
01:47:15,829 --> 01:47:17,220
Uma?
- Yeah, I am Uma.

1717
01:47:24,554 --> 01:47:25,890
What is this sudden surprise?

1718
01:47:26,156 --> 01:47:28,836
Nothing much! I forgot to give
you the card in the hospital.

1719
01:47:29,078 --> 01:47:31,062
I also wanted to see the baby.

1720
01:47:40,422 --> 01:47:41,336
Tea or Coffee?

1721
01:47:41,523 --> 01:47:42,038
Coffee!

1722
01:47:42,247 --> 01:47:43,435
Have a seat. I will get it.

1723
01:47:44,943 --> 01:47:46,005
Isn’t anyone home?

1724
01:47:46,044 --> 01:47:47,701
They went to the market
They will come.

1725
01:48:00,146 --> 01:48:01,255
Hi Chitti.

1726
01:48:02,161 --> 01:48:03,239
How are you?

1727
01:48:03,458 --> 01:48:04,427
Is your fever gone?

1728
01:48:04,536 --> 01:48:07,185
Tell me if there is anything to say
I will treat you. Okay?

1729
01:48:07,231 --> 01:48:08,224
Uma.
- Chitti.

1730
01:48:10,466 --> 01:48:11,474
Sorry.
- Thank you.

1731
01:48:14,279 --> 01:48:16,559
Do you have a brother?

1732
01:48:17,072 --> 01:48:17,704
No…

1733
01:48:17,861 --> 01:48:19,494
That’s my dad and me.

1734
01:48:19,946 --> 01:48:20,696
Dad?

1735
01:48:21,228 --> 01:48:21,946
How?

1736
01:48:22,447 --> 01:48:25,603
He merged my childhood
pictures with his and framed them.

1737
01:48:26,220 --> 01:48:26,790
You know?

1738
01:48:27,486 --> 01:48:30,173
He becomes my mother whenever I need one.

1739
01:48:30,611 --> 01:48:32,509
Sometimes, he becomes my brother or sister.

1740
01:48:32,884 --> 01:48:34,111
He is my best friend.

1741
01:48:34,189 --> 01:48:36,165
He is the best dad in the world.

1742
01:48:37,056 --> 01:48:38,017
Interesting!

1743
01:48:38,369 --> 01:48:40,251
But, how did Chitti happen suddenly?

1744
01:48:40,572 --> 01:48:44,602
I mean…about Chitti
and your father’s lifestyle…

1745
01:48:44,712 --> 01:48:45,946
Don’t you feel embarrassing?

1746
01:48:46,033 --> 01:48:50,704
No matter how happy you are, people
know what they lack when they are alone.

1747
01:48:50,962 --> 01:48:54,056
He is always in search
of fulfilling what he lacks.

1748
01:48:55,290 --> 01:48:58,290
My dad chose his own
path to fulfill what he lacks.

1749
01:48:58,994 --> 01:49:03,532
He enjoys his life
without troubling anyone.

1750
01:49:03,994 --> 01:49:06,759
Of course, Chitti is a
result of his lifestyle.

1751
01:49:06,869 --> 01:49:09,197
We don’t have any issues with Chitti
We all are happy.

1752
01:49:13,369 --> 01:49:14,345
Chitti.

1753
01:49:14,712 --> 01:49:16,126
Why did she stop crying?

1754
01:49:16,236 --> 01:49:22,204
Chitti! I doubt your future after
meeting your father and brother.

1755
01:49:22,399 --> 01:49:27,634
See! There are few things
about how a girl’s life should be.

1756
01:49:27,976 --> 01:49:30,673
They will be beautiful
only if they follow that.

1757
01:49:30,704 --> 01:49:32,438
Everyone would like them.

1758
01:49:32,822 --> 01:49:36,025
If Chitti stays here, she
might become your friend.

1759
01:49:36,845 --> 01:49:40,290
But, she’d be a daughter
and a sister if fostered well.

1760
01:49:44,072 --> 01:49:45,251
Take care of her. Okay?

1761
01:49:50,525 --> 01:49:52,025
For your kind information, Karthik!

1762
01:49:52,181 --> 01:49:54,564
Purity is not having this!

1763
01:49:54,704 --> 01:49:57,118
Not using it.

1764
01:49:57,212 --> 01:49:59,642
Sex is not a physical satisfaction.

1765
01:49:59,673 --> 01:50:03,141
It is a state of ecstasy for the soul.

1766
01:50:09,978 --> 01:50:11,087
I am sorry.

1767
01:50:11,986 --> 01:50:15,361
I shouldn’t have behaved
that way on that day.

1768
01:50:16,352 --> 01:50:18,618
I hope you are not angry with me.
- No.

1769
01:50:19,619 --> 01:50:22,564
Will you attend my marriage?
Sorry. Will you all come?

1770
01:50:24,978 --> 01:50:25,908
Yeah. Of course!

1771
01:50:25,947 --> 01:50:28,384
Then, why don’t you come along?
- With you?

1772
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:30,298
That’s when I will know you are not angry.

1773
01:50:30,384 --> 01:50:33,016
There are so many kids in my house.

1774
01:50:33,150 --> 01:50:35,642
If you stay there for a while,

1775
01:50:35,697 --> 01:50:38,806
You will understand how to foster Chitti.

1776
01:50:43,306 --> 01:50:44,111
What?

1777
01:50:47,111 --> 01:50:48,642
Gayatri, Janaki, Savitri.

1778
01:50:48,689 --> 01:50:51,212
Bulloda, Chinnoda, Peddoda!
All of you come.

1779
01:50:51,283 --> 01:50:54,274
She is getting married soon
But, she came with someone.

1780
01:50:54,337 --> 01:50:55,697
Who is he? Is he Lover or husband?

1781
01:50:55,722 --> 01:50:57,861
I caught the thief…
- What happened?

1782
01:50:58,587 --> 01:51:00,369
Why is everyone like that?

1783
01:51:01,048 --> 01:51:03,587
Why doesn’t anyone speak
when I ask what happened?

1784
01:51:04,408 --> 01:51:06,228
Hey! I am not caught.

1785
01:51:07,134 --> 01:51:09,681
He is my friend and she is his daughter.

1786
01:51:12,603 --> 01:51:14,626
His wife died recently.

1787
01:51:14,923 --> 01:51:16,732
I brought him here
because I thought his mood

1788
01:51:16,756 --> 01:51:18,564
would change if he
stays with us for a while.

1789
01:51:22,462 --> 01:51:24,915
I thought he might find a solution.

1790
01:51:25,212 --> 01:51:27,189
Now I guess all of you
would become a problem.

1791
01:51:28,509 --> 01:51:30,947
Stop looking like that.
- No, Uma.

1792
01:51:31,306 --> 01:51:34,556
You are getting married soon.
- You showed up suddenly with a guy.

1793
01:51:34,704 --> 01:51:38,524
I feel humiliated if you talk like that.

1794
01:51:39,376 --> 01:51:40,829
Mom! Where is dad?

1795
01:51:47,361 --> 01:51:49,775
See, dad! Mom’s expressions are different.

1796
01:51:49,954 --> 01:51:51,634
I don’t care about anyone.

1797
01:51:51,814 --> 01:51:52,540
You tell me.

1798
01:51:57,251 --> 01:51:58,126
Is it true?

1799
01:52:01,759 --> 01:52:02,533
It is true, dad.

1800
01:52:05,556 --> 01:52:06,806
Take him upstairs.

1801
01:52:15,322 --> 01:52:17,299
Hi, brother How are you?
- I am good, bro.

1802
01:52:17,354 --> 01:52:18,417
Oh! Do you already know him?

1803
01:52:18,886 --> 01:52:20,979
Yeah! We met him at the
hospital where Uma works.

1804
01:52:21,237 --> 01:52:24,760
Brother. The matter you gave
me worked out for my seminar.

1805
01:52:24,815 --> 01:52:26,049
Oh...Nice.

1806
01:52:35,339 --> 01:52:37,729
Are you feeling bad that I lied?

1807
01:52:37,831 --> 01:52:39,917
It won’t look good if I tell the truth.

1808
01:52:40,565 --> 01:52:43,870
See! They thought something
is going on between us.

1809
01:52:44,057 --> 01:52:48,127
They may not accept you if
they know Chitti’s real story.

1810
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:49,409
It is okay.

1811
01:52:50,502 --> 01:52:52,846
It is just a tiny lie
for the sake of Chitti.

1812
01:52:53,143 --> 01:52:54,425
Now, smile!

1813
01:52:56,628 --> 01:52:58,667
I suspect something fishy, boss.

1814
01:52:59,104 --> 01:52:59,885
What?

1815
01:53:00,377 --> 01:53:05,799
That guy, Uma, and the
baby are related I guess.

1816
01:53:06,089 --> 01:53:07,675
No. That is not true.

1817
01:53:08,620 --> 01:53:13,830
Sir asked for the truth and I think
the truth she said is not genuine.

1818
01:53:14,346 --> 01:53:15,245
Yeah, right.

1819
01:53:15,370 --> 01:53:17,073
I haven’t thought about it that way.

1820
01:53:17,393 --> 01:53:18,846
I will find that mystery.

1821
01:53:19,034 --> 01:53:20,339
How to break that mystery?

1822
01:53:21,409 --> 01:53:22,487
Google it.

1823
01:53:23,190 --> 01:53:26,979
How to check if a girl is a mother or not?

1824
01:53:28,541 --> 01:53:29,502
Boss! Got it.

1825
01:53:29,925 --> 01:53:34,924
If a girl becomes a mother, there
will be stretch marks on her belly.

1826
01:53:35,839 --> 01:53:36,456
Is it?

1827
01:53:37,089 --> 01:53:38,057
Second!

1828
01:53:38,393 --> 01:53:40,284
His hands might loosen.

1829
01:53:41,018 --> 01:53:42,034
I see.

1830
01:53:42,455 --> 01:53:43,705
I will also see.

1831
01:53:44,081 --> 01:53:45,729
We will see.

1832
01:54:08,972 --> 01:54:11,690
How did that hen get up there?

1833
01:54:13,972 --> 01:54:16,128
Hey! Do you know how to write a song?
- Why, sir?

1834
01:54:16,784 --> 01:54:22,899
I get a ticklish feeling when I see Uma.

1835
01:54:23,212 --> 01:54:25,055
Why don’t you write it if you can feel it?

1836
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:28,649
I know that my Telugu is not that perfect.

1837
01:54:29,164 --> 01:54:30,555
I want a Telugu song.

1838
01:54:30,587 --> 01:54:31,853
Telugu song?

1839
01:54:32,048 --> 01:54:35,189
If you want it in Telugu, you
should ask Uma’s friend Karthik.

1840
01:54:35,947 --> 01:54:36,681
Correct.

1841
01:54:38,181 --> 01:54:41,314
How did that hen get up there?

1842
01:54:41,618 --> 01:54:42,446
Don’t you know?

1843
01:54:43,009 --> 01:54:44,618
No, sir.
- Hey…

1844
01:54:44,993 --> 01:54:46,572
Stop feeling shy and learn it.

1845
01:54:49,087 --> 01:54:51,766
How did that hen get up there?

1846
01:54:51,954 --> 01:54:53,962
Give me 2 minutes
Food is on the way.

1847
01:54:54,040 --> 01:54:56,024
Karthik! This food is for Chitti.
- Uma! Offer flowers to God.

1848
01:54:56,072 --> 01:54:58,055
Mom is calling me
Give me 2 minutes. I will come.

1849
01:54:58,704 --> 01:55:00,227
Hey! Food is here.

1850
01:55:02,853 --> 01:55:04,798
Brother...My dear brother!

1851
01:55:06,447 --> 01:55:09,040
I want to say something
I don’t know how to say it.

1852
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:11,570
I want to sing a song for Uma.

1853
01:55:11,898 --> 01:55:12,577
Oh, wow.

1854
01:55:12,788 --> 01:55:14,327
Fantastic, bro.
- It is not fantastic.

1855
01:55:14,352 --> 01:55:15,875
You have to write something for me to sing.

1856
01:55:17,132 --> 01:55:18,656
Me?
- Don’t say no.

1857
01:55:18,771 --> 01:55:19,748
No…Please.

1858
01:55:19,873 --> 01:55:22,201
Uma is your friend. So, I am your friend.

1859
01:55:22,358 --> 01:55:23,865
Can’t you help your friend?

1860
01:55:24,357 --> 01:55:25,248
You tell him.

1861
01:55:25,436 --> 01:55:25,943
Please.

1862
01:55:26,193 --> 01:55:27,545
Let’s do this.

1863
01:55:27,959 --> 01:55:30,889
I will tell you just like Kamal
Hassan in the Guna movie.

1864
01:55:30,958 --> 01:55:32,755
You write it in words
What do you say?

1865
01:55:33,486 --> 01:55:33,955
Okay?

1866
01:55:35,220 --> 01:55:35,916
I will try.

1867
01:55:36,408 --> 01:55:37,471
So sweet of you!

1868
01:55:37,978 --> 01:55:40,447
There is a plant named Hoodia in Africa.

1869
01:55:40,502 --> 01:55:41,174
Hoodia?

1870
01:55:41,221 --> 01:55:44,306
That plant quenches the thirst
and gives energy to pursuers.

1871
01:55:44,439 --> 01:55:46,056
Uma is just like that to me.

1872
01:55:46,315 --> 01:55:47,260
I am impressed.

1873
01:55:49,822 --> 01:55:52,244
“Hey, Hoodia!”

1874
01:55:52,908 --> 01:55:54,705
“I fell in love with you”

1875
01:55:54,799 --> 01:55:55,760
That’s right.

1876
01:55:55,838 --> 01:55:58,229
“This very moment”

1877
01:55:58,830 --> 01:56:00,525
“I became a lover”

1878
01:56:00,550 --> 01:56:01,355
That’s right.

1879
01:56:01,510 --> 01:56:02,697
Aged sir!
- Who is that?

1880
01:56:02,736 --> 01:56:03,924
I arranged water for your bath.

1881
01:56:06,174 --> 01:56:08,244
I will go have a bath
Let’s do this after I get fresh.

1882
01:56:31,697 --> 01:56:34,229
“Hey, Hoodia!”

1883
01:56:34,393 --> 01:56:36,705
“I fell in love with you”

1884
01:56:37,056 --> 01:56:42,345
“This very moment
I became a lover”

1885
01:56:42,393 --> 01:56:47,486
“O’ my love
This is your magic”

1886
01:56:47,705 --> 01:56:50,064
“O’ my dear”

1887
01:56:50,393 --> 01:56:52,861
“Is it real or a dream?”

1888
01:56:53,018 --> 01:56:57,939
“You are musical notes of my heart”

1889
01:56:58,385 --> 01:57:02,916
“You flattered me with your gaze”

1890
01:57:03,729 --> 01:57:08,861
“You are like a dream amidst the stars”

1891
01:57:09,033 --> 01:57:13,939
“You changed me like a bouncing ball”

1892
01:57:14,869 --> 01:57:19,642
“You are born with cuteness”

1893
01:57:19,713 --> 01:57:24,673
“You exhilarated your moves”

1894
01:57:24,978 --> 01:57:27,642
“Hey, Hoodia!”

1895
01:57:27,699 --> 01:57:30,361
“Yeah…Hoodia!”

1896
01:57:30,416 --> 01:57:32,736
“Hey, Hoodia!”

1897
01:57:33,041 --> 01:57:36,400
“Yeah…Hoodia!”

1898
01:57:41,432 --> 01:57:43,549
Karthik, Try to be gentle.

1899
01:57:44,385 --> 01:57:45,432
She’s a girl, right?

1900
01:57:54,846 --> 01:57:56,643
[PLAY HYMN]

1901
01:57:59,674 --> 01:58:01,697
How come the smiley is talking?

1902
01:58:01,807 --> 01:58:04,455
It is not a smiley
He is talking.

1903
01:58:04,736 --> 01:58:06,893
That is called ventriloquism.

1904
01:58:07,065 --> 01:58:10,142
He talks without moving
his lips like magic.

1905
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:11,143
Isn’t it right, Karthik?

1906
01:58:25,143 --> 01:58:27,314
Close your eyes, They might see us.
- Okay, boss…

1907
01:58:27,518 --> 01:58:29,650
Son-in-law! Will you eat sweet?
- No. Go away.

1908
01:58:29,752 --> 01:58:31,057
Okay, then
I will give it to Karthik.

1909
01:58:31,424 --> 01:58:33,697
You are son-in-law!
- Gosh! This guy! Go and get it.

1910
01:58:34,690 --> 01:58:35,643
That’s enough
It is good.

1911
01:58:35,979 --> 01:58:36,923
Where are going, sir?

1912
01:58:36,947 --> 01:58:38,869
The song is still pending
I will go and finish it.

1913
01:58:39,002 --> 01:58:40,065
I do not like it, sir.

1914
01:58:40,299 --> 01:58:41,666
Why? It is good, right?

1915
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:44,080
I am nothing talking about sweet
I said it about the song.

1916
01:58:44,190 --> 01:58:46,018
What is the problem with the song?

1917
01:58:46,252 --> 01:58:49,072
You said that you would sing in Telugu
But, here it says Hoodia.

1918
01:58:49,166 --> 01:58:51,025
Looks like a different language.

1919
01:58:51,244 --> 01:58:53,306
Hoodia is a plant name.

1920
01:58:53,338 --> 01:58:54,815
Plant?
- Names don’t have languages.

1921
01:58:55,533 --> 01:58:56,408
My sweets!

1922
01:58:56,635 --> 01:59:01,594
“The wedding…the wedding is all set”

1923
01:59:01,619 --> 01:59:06,189
“I will be their son-in-law”

1924
01:59:07,291 --> 01:59:11,393
“Ecstatic…her lips are ecstatic”

1925
01:59:16,424 --> 01:59:22,103
“Be brother or uncle”

1926
01:59:22,236 --> 01:59:27,322
“I will be your slave with any relation”

1927
01:59:27,565 --> 01:59:33,587
“I will treasure you in my heart”

1928
01:59:33,736 --> 01:59:36,228
“Hey, Hoodia!”

1929
01:59:36,354 --> 01:59:39,244
“Yeah…Hoodia!”

1930
01:59:39,315 --> 01:59:41,682
“Hey, Hoodia!”

1931
01:59:41,736 --> 01:59:44,510
“Yeah…Hoodia!”

1932
01:59:44,736 --> 01:59:47,213
Mom! Brother is not giving me my toy.

1933
01:59:47,424 --> 01:59:51,392
Why are you fighting
with her? She is a girl.

1934
01:59:51,549 --> 01:59:53,299
Why are you playing with him like a boy?

1935
01:59:53,430 --> 01:59:54,290
Go.

1936
01:59:54,869 --> 01:59:59,111
I thought I should learn
from you and foster Chitti.

1937
01:59:59,736 --> 02:00:02,908
But, you talk about gender differences.

1938
02:00:03,174 --> 02:00:05,588
Girls might think they’re trivial.

1939
02:00:05,744 --> 02:00:07,588
That is not a triviality, Karthik.

1940
02:00:08,166 --> 02:00:10,182
I am just teaching them the difference.

1941
02:00:10,986 --> 02:00:14,190
A woman and a man can never be the same.

1942
02:00:14,697 --> 02:00:16,611
It doesn’t mean someone is trivial.

1943
02:00:17,025 --> 02:00:18,510
A guy has courage.

1944
02:00:18,822 --> 02:00:20,354
A girl has patience.

1945
02:00:21,190 --> 02:00:23,315
We are brave that you are with us.

1946
02:00:23,580 --> 02:00:27,439
You should know that we
understand everything with patience.

1947
02:00:30,627 --> 02:00:34,268
Both genders should have
different forms and activities.

1948
02:00:34,799 --> 02:00:37,244
That's when there would be
an attraction between them.

1949
02:00:37,830 --> 02:00:40,400
We should foster them and make
them understand the difference.

1950
02:00:40,861 --> 02:00:43,346
I will foster Chitti like a true woman.

1951
02:00:43,533 --> 02:00:46,783
See! You are learning a
lot because of coming here.

1952
02:00:49,556 --> 02:00:50,299
Thank you.

1953
02:00:52,293 --> 02:00:53,504
Hey, kids! Come here.

1954
02:00:54,286 --> 02:00:55,887
Let’s play a strength game.

1955
02:00:55,973 --> 02:00:57,669
Strength game?
What is that?

1956
02:00:57,694 --> 02:00:59,637
I don’t know
Stand in a queue and make this pose.

1957
02:01:03,872 --> 02:01:04,950
Uma! You come.

1958
02:01:05,630 --> 02:01:07,067
This is not a strength game.

1959
02:01:07,278 --> 02:01:08,278
I will show you.

1960
02:01:08,450 --> 02:01:09,200
Let’s start.

1961
02:01:16,809 --> 02:01:17,262
Sir!

1962
02:01:18,239 --> 02:01:19,122
Did your pants become loose?

1963
02:01:19,544 --> 02:01:21,458
Does it look like it? It is an iron rod.

1964
02:01:22,825 --> 02:01:23,536
Get lost.

1965
02:01:24,044 --> 02:01:25,255
Sir! Song…

1966
02:01:25,575 --> 02:01:27,955
He was under my care in America.
- Sir! Please move.

1967
02:01:27,979 --> 02:01:29,549
Yeah…Thank you.

1968
02:01:30,489 --> 02:01:32,294
Grandpa! How is the song?
Yeah! Thank you.

1969
02:01:32,895 --> 02:01:34,692
He will ask but never listens.

1970
02:01:34,817 --> 02:01:36,192
It is good.

1971
02:01:36,270 --> 02:01:41,653
“Shall I teach kids how to walk?”

1972
02:01:41,678 --> 02:01:46,168
“Shall I become their playmate?”

1973
02:01:47,005 --> 02:01:52,246
“Shall I be a grandpa to
tell stories to the kids?”

1974
02:01:52,271 --> 02:01:56,793
“Shall I pamper them with my lips?”

1975
02:01:56,864 --> 02:02:02,137
“Shall I make all relations?”

1976
02:02:02,216 --> 02:02:07,465
“Shall I treat you like my darling?”

1977
02:02:08,403 --> 02:02:10,934
“Hey, Hoodia!”

1978
02:02:11,012 --> 02:02:13,692
“Yeah…Hoodia!”

1979
02:02:13,747 --> 02:02:16,270
“Hey, Hoodia!”

1980
02:02:16,364 --> 02:02:19,137
“Yeah…Hoodia!”

1981
02:02:23,778 --> 02:02:26,794
Sister! I like brother-in-law Karthik
I will marry him.

1982
02:02:26,958 --> 02:02:28,559
Are you crazy?

1983
02:02:29,129 --> 02:02:31,785
How can you call him brother-in-law?

1984
02:02:32,044 --> 02:02:34,114
If our parents hear you,
they will reprimand you.

1985
02:02:35,083 --> 02:02:36,716
Why would they do that?

1986
02:02:36,832 --> 02:02:38,762
They should get me married
to someone one day, right?

1987
02:02:38,787 --> 02:02:40,467
It would be nice if
they give me to Karthik.

1988
02:02:40,653 --> 02:02:41,621
Shut up.

1989
02:02:42,294 --> 02:02:47,371
Why did you opt for arranged
marriage instead of love marriage?

1990
02:02:49,809 --> 02:02:55,292
Sometimes, we get hitched
before we realize that we are in love.

1991
02:02:56,378 --> 02:02:58,472
What are you talking about at this hour?
Go and sleep.

1992
02:02:58,981 --> 02:03:00,895
Okay, sis. Let meet tomorrow.

1993
02:03:01,294 --> 02:03:01,840
Bye, sis.

1994
02:03:01,880 --> 02:03:03,372
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1995
02:03:07,278 --> 02:03:11,028
What’s going on? Are you feeling
jealous that everyone likes Karthik?

1996
02:03:11,090 --> 02:03:13,504
Jealous? Why would I feel jealous, sis?

1997
02:03:13,841 --> 02:03:15,786
Do you know the weakness of a woman?

1998
02:03:16,091 --> 02:03:18,911
We get caught even if we try to hide.

1999
02:03:19,286 --> 02:03:20,083
Tell me the truth.

2000
02:03:20,426 --> 02:03:22,512
Isn’t anything going on
between you and Karthik?

2001
02:03:22,966 --> 02:03:24,161
How can you question me that, sis?

2002
02:03:25,230 --> 02:03:27,332
If you cannot answer this,

2003
02:03:29,020 --> 02:03:30,465
I am sure something is going on.

2004
02:03:30,885 --> 02:03:35,590
Simple! If you think everything is
over, you will have to regret it lifelong.

2005
02:03:35,934 --> 02:03:38,366
You might still get a
chance if you step forward

2006
02:03:38,390 --> 02:03:40,613
with the hope that
something will happen.

2007
02:03:40,669 --> 02:03:41,723
Think about it.

2008
02:03:44,583 --> 02:03:45,770
Is there something?

2009
02:03:46,051 --> 02:03:46,989
No.

2010
02:03:47,098 --> 02:03:47,989
What is it?

2011
02:03:49,894 --> 02:03:50,410
No.

2012
02:03:52,059 --> 02:03:53,020
There is nothing.

2013
02:03:59,833 --> 02:04:03,387
Uma! Do you know what girls see
when they stand in front of a mirror?

2014
02:04:03,575 --> 02:04:04,270
Lie!

2015
02:04:05,847 --> 02:04:08,691
Uma misunderstood me
before I got to know her.

2016
02:04:09,716 --> 02:04:12,489
She gave me her wedding card
before I could express my feelings.

2017
02:04:14,856 --> 02:04:18,684
I want to be with her all my life.

2018
02:04:20,113 --> 02:04:23,270
Whenever I realize I cannot be with her,
I feel sad.

2019
02:04:25,301 --> 02:04:27,403
People say everything
you desire may not happen.

2020
02:04:28,020 --> 02:04:29,442
I thought, why not?

2021
02:04:29,708 --> 02:04:31,122
My dad fostered me that way.

2022
02:04:32,731 --> 02:04:34,106
Okay, Our dad!

2023
02:04:35,364 --> 02:04:38,153
She could be my wife if
everything went perfectly.

2024
02:04:38,794 --> 02:04:39,809
She’d be your sister-in-law.

2025
02:04:40,512 --> 02:04:42,512
Hi, Uma
What brings you here now?

2026
02:04:42,887 --> 02:04:44,341
Nothing.
- Did you come to see me?

2027
02:04:44,466 --> 02:04:45,856
Nothing like that!

2028
02:04:46,028 --> 02:04:46,966
Did you come to see Karthik?

2029
02:04:48,567 --> 02:04:49,091
Yes.

2030
02:04:49,294 --> 02:04:50,059
I came to see Karthik.

2031
02:04:50,637 --> 02:04:52,653
Why don’t you marry Karthik then?

2032
02:04:57,223 --> 02:04:59,372
Actually, I thought the same.

2033
02:04:59,433 --> 02:05:01,863
Hey! I was just joking
Why are you getting serious?

2034
02:05:02,583 --> 02:05:04,755
I am not joking
I am serious.

2035
02:05:05,184 --> 02:05:07,966
You searched for stretch
marks and observed my arms.

2036
02:05:08,098 --> 02:05:09,669
You checked my mobile.

2037
02:05:09,747 --> 02:05:11,223
I know everything you did.

2038
02:05:11,489 --> 02:05:12,512
Uma…
- Das!

2039
02:05:13,434 --> 02:05:16,137
You doubt that Karthik
and I are in a relation.

2040
02:05:16,231 --> 02:05:18,699
I am confused about
what’s going on between us.

2041
02:05:18,801 --> 02:05:22,113
It is not right to spoil both our lives.

2042
02:05:22,997 --> 02:05:26,699
I can compromise in a
game but never in life.

2043
02:05:27,198 --> 02:05:30,315
See! Stop researching about relations.

2044
02:05:30,520 --> 02:05:33,043
Search for a relationship that matches you.

2045
02:05:33,348 --> 02:05:35,942
I guess your thesis is done already.

2046
02:05:38,231 --> 02:05:42,145
There is no need to specially
tell what you should do.

2047
02:06:02,458 --> 02:06:05,606
Greetings to everyone!

2048
02:06:06,066 --> 02:06:07,449
Acknowledge!
- Yeah, right.

2049
02:06:07,871 --> 02:06:11,480
I worked hard and did
some research for 4 months.

2050
02:06:11,512 --> 02:06:13,653
That’s how I created this family tree.
- Tree!

2051
02:06:13,747 --> 02:06:16,684
I said the same.
- Son-in-law! Will you have sweets?

2052
02:06:16,863 --> 02:06:20,153
Hey! Why are you bothered about sweets now?

2053
02:06:20,231 --> 02:06:22,247
Okay, then. I will give it to Karthik.

2054
02:06:22,309 --> 02:06:24,169
Karthik?
- Control!

2055
02:06:24,918 --> 02:06:29,824
According to this family tree, I
will tell you about all your relations.

2056
02:06:30,122 --> 02:06:30,809
Son!

2057
02:06:30,989 --> 02:06:31,973
In your tree…

2058
02:06:31,998 --> 02:06:34,207
Sorry! What is my
place in your family tree?

2059
02:06:36,668 --> 02:06:39,363
This is your place.
- Don’t be harsh on it, son.

2060
02:06:40,276 --> 02:06:41,324
Sorry.
- Brother-in-law!

2061
02:06:41,403 --> 02:06:42,762
What is she to me?

2062
02:06:43,074 --> 02:06:44,988
She is your sister.

2063
02:06:46,675 --> 02:06:50,277
They are getting silly
doubts because of your class.

2064
02:06:50,356 --> 02:06:50,981
Enough.

2065
02:06:51,150 --> 02:06:52,965
You do not understand
the value of this tree.

2066
02:06:53,028 --> 02:06:54,676
What are you by the way?

2067
02:06:55,355 --> 02:06:56,910
I am not a part of your family.

2068
02:06:57,161 --> 02:06:58,379
So, I am different.

2069
02:07:02,848 --> 02:07:04,192
Hey! Be careful.

2070
02:07:04,614 --> 02:07:05,676
What’s that?

2071
02:07:06,255 --> 02:07:07,044
Just a minute!

2072
02:07:07,536 --> 02:07:08,278
Uma.

2073
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:13,778
What is your sister to you?
- Sister!

2074
02:07:14,161 --> 02:07:14,910
What is he?

2075
02:07:14,935 --> 02:07:17,263
He is my mother’s
brother. So, he is my uncle.

2076
02:07:17,364 --> 02:07:19,980
He married my sister
So, he is my brother-in-law.

2077
02:07:20,137 --> 02:07:21,098
What is he?

2078
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:22,551
I am his aunt.

2079
02:07:22,614 --> 02:07:23,747
He is my nephew.

2080
02:07:25,392 --> 02:07:28,386
You didn't even do a Ph.D
How can you be so sure?

2081
02:07:29,691 --> 02:07:31,433
What is your mother to me?

2082
02:07:31,606 --> 02:07:32,778
Mother-in-law!

2083
02:07:32,841 --> 02:07:34,676
What is her brother to me?

2084
02:07:34,817 --> 02:07:37,801
Uncle! More like dad.

2085
02:07:38,504 --> 02:07:39,363
Nice.

2086
02:07:39,871 --> 02:07:43,348
Then, what is my uncle’s son to me?

2087
02:07:43,512 --> 02:07:45,746
He is your brother.

2088
02:07:45,833 --> 02:07:46,919
Oh! Nice.

2089
02:07:47,325 --> 02:07:48,895
Everything is clear till now.

2090
02:07:50,161 --> 02:07:52,832
Now, you are more like
a mother to my brother.

2091
02:07:52,864 --> 02:07:54,934
You are a mother to me, right?

2092
02:07:57,278 --> 02:07:59,426
That is…
- Yes or No?

2093
02:08:00,833 --> 02:08:01,817
Yes or No?

2094
02:08:05,075 --> 02:08:05,676
Yes!

2095
02:08:06,903 --> 02:08:09,645
How can you people get a
mother married to her son?

2096
02:08:10,137 --> 02:08:11,059
Is it right?

2097
02:08:11,159 --> 02:08:14,898
Is that your tradition?
- Hey! What sort of a mind is that?9

2098
02:08:15,196 --> 02:08:20,742
You became crazy after
completing your Ph.D.

2099
02:08:20,767 --> 02:08:23,047
It is your mistake to find a
girl who is more like my mother.

2100
02:08:23,188 --> 02:08:24,930
Shut your mouth.

2101
02:08:25,243 --> 02:08:27,946
Mr. Raghavaiah!
I will convince this fellow.

2102
02:08:28,297 --> 02:08:29,586
He does not believe it.

2103
02:08:29,915 --> 02:08:32,227
I mean he doesn't
believe in such tradition.

2104
02:08:32,368 --> 02:08:34,063
He doesn't believe in our culture.

2105
02:08:34,657 --> 02:08:37,984
He doesn’t believe people.
- No, Mr. Raghavaiah.

2106
02:08:41,703 --> 02:08:43,719
When I saw you wearing
a jacket on a sunny day,

2107
02:08:43,744 --> 02:08:45,071
I suspected something wrong would happen.

2108
02:08:45,141 --> 02:08:47,071
Get a good match at least now.

2109
02:08:49,735 --> 02:08:51,040
Go away, Melkove.

2110
02:08:51,555 --> 02:08:53,790
Melkotaiah!

2111
02:08:58,563 --> 02:09:00,735
Hey! Explain it.
- I will be there, sir.

2112
02:09:03,407 --> 02:09:05,977
You doubt that Karthik
and I are in a relation.

2113
02:09:06,459 --> 02:09:08,563
I am confused about
what’s going on between us.

2114
02:09:08,633 --> 02:09:11,750
It is not right to spoil both our lives.

2115
02:09:11,851 --> 02:09:15,625
He might tie the knot with
these doubts in my mind.

2116
02:09:15,961 --> 02:09:17,711
But, he cannot keep you happy.

2117
02:09:24,735 --> 02:09:27,422
Chitti, Did you say something?

2118
02:09:42,782 --> 02:09:43,969
Karthik! What happened?

2119
02:09:44,102 --> 02:09:46,079
Did you come to your senses?

2120
02:09:46,540 --> 02:09:48,102
I am not feeling good, Karthik.

2121
02:09:48,204 --> 02:09:50,165
You should eat something
like a Dosa when you’re low.

2122
02:09:50,946 --> 02:09:51,626
Get down.

2123
02:10:01,141 --> 02:10:01,829
Karthik!

2124
02:10:02,387 --> 02:10:05,059
Take Chitti.
- Hey! It is okay I will bring the food.

2125
02:10:05,227 --> 02:10:05,883
Karthik.

2126
02:10:07,126 --> 02:10:07,688
Okay.

2127
02:10:10,743 --> 02:10:13,734
Sit here
I will wash my face and be back.

2128
02:10:13,759 --> 02:10:14,673
Okay?

2129
02:10:15,219 --> 02:10:16,273
Cutie!

2130
02:10:24,390 --> 02:10:26,171
Take it…

2131
02:10:26,743 --> 02:10:28,305
Chitti…

2132
02:10:29,196 --> 02:10:31,665
Come on…Cry more.

2133
02:10:35,125 --> 02:10:39,430
See! Your mother is here.

2134
02:10:52,211 --> 02:10:53,930
Hey, Uma
Why is Chitti crying?

2135
02:10:54,110 --> 02:10:55,891
Where is honey, Karthik?
- It is in the car.

2136
02:11:06,250 --> 02:11:07,117
Have a little.

2137
02:11:08,352 --> 02:11:11,024
Karthik, Stay out and close the door.

2138
02:11:56,532 --> 02:11:58,360
Sit down, boy!
You should be fine.

2139
02:11:58,907 --> 02:12:00,188
Is it?
- You eat.

2140
02:12:00,446 --> 02:12:02,852
What's wrong with sharing some tips?

2141
02:12:47,938 --> 02:12:49,266
Excuse me.
- Tell me, sir.

2142
02:12:49,291 --> 02:12:50,235
I need two rooms.

2143
02:12:51,586 --> 02:12:52,571
We cannot give two rooms.

2144
02:12:52,805 --> 02:12:53,805
Why not?

2145
02:12:53,860 --> 02:12:55,602
Our Hotel follows some rules.

2146
02:12:55,719 --> 02:12:58,211
We won't give separate rooms to a
couple and a single room to lovers.

2147
02:12:58,516 --> 02:13:00,485
Why don’t you say something?
- What do you want to hear?

2148
02:13:00,610 --> 02:13:02,165
Can’t you understand?

2149
02:13:02,313 --> 02:13:03,938
There is nothing between us.
- Hubby!

2150
02:13:04,047 --> 02:13:05,696
Book one room.

2151
02:13:06,368 --> 02:13:07,149
One room!

2152
02:13:10,868 --> 02:13:13,743
Sir! You have a baby but looks
like you recently got married.

2153
02:13:14,149 --> 02:13:16,360
It would a perfect choice for you.

2154
02:13:20,485 --> 02:13:21,211
Bro!

2155
02:13:22,047 --> 02:13:25,766
There is nothing in the room, right?

2156
02:13:25,985 --> 02:13:27,610
What do you mean, sir?

2157
02:13:29,329 --> 02:13:30,899
I mean, safety!

2158
02:13:30,952 --> 02:13:32,905
Why does a couple need safety?
- No!

2159
02:13:33,282 --> 02:13:34,376
I said no.

2160
02:13:34,969 --> 02:13:36,001
Not there, right?

2161
02:13:37,469 --> 02:13:41,250
You are right, sir
Satisfaction would be great without safety.

2162
02:14:03,415 --> 02:14:04,508
Oh my God!

2163
02:14:15,507 --> 02:14:17,288
[SINGING]

2164
02:14:19,999 --> 02:14:22,983
Chitti! Is your brother a bathroom singer?

2165
02:14:23,327 --> 02:14:24,154
It is good.

2166
02:14:24,819 --> 02:14:26,437
You are so beautiful.

2167
02:14:39,499 --> 02:14:41,342
You are so beautiful.

2168
02:14:41,435 --> 02:14:42,999
Hey! That’s mine.

2169
02:14:51,936 --> 02:14:52,889
Oh my God!

2170
02:14:54,639 --> 02:14:55,506
Chitti.

2171
02:14:55,592 --> 02:14:58,561
Your cuteness overloads day by day.

2172
02:15:00,624 --> 02:15:02,717
I gave you a good compliment.

2173
02:15:04,124 --> 02:15:05,350
Won’t you even thank me?

2174
02:15:07,459 --> 02:15:09,779
I expected thanks.

2175
02:15:10,077 --> 02:15:12,585
How can you say that it is a compliment?

2176
02:15:12,731 --> 02:15:13,497
Uma.

2177
02:15:14,139 --> 02:15:15,100
Is she the same?

2178
02:15:17,677 --> 02:15:19,506
Do you like me?
- A lot!

2179
02:15:24,857 --> 02:15:27,475
What's my number on the list?

2180
02:15:27,686 --> 02:15:28,389
Two!

2181
02:15:28,827 --> 02:15:31,616
Who’s the first one?
- Last December 31st!

2182
02:15:31,717 --> 02:15:35,295
I proposed to a beautiful
girl at Butterfly pub.

2183
02:15:35,342 --> 02:15:37,358
What did that girl say?

2184
02:15:37,842 --> 02:15:40,147
She said true love takes time to happen.

2185
02:15:44,936 --> 02:15:45,303
Hmm.

2186
02:15:46,077 --> 02:15:47,139
What will you do now?

2187
02:15:48,358 --> 02:15:53,068
I will wait for her to accept my true love.

2188
02:15:55,741 --> 02:15:59,139
You are waiting for
her to accept your love.

2189
02:16:00,764 --> 02:16:04,959
She wants to experience
your true love for life.

2190
02:16:06,256 --> 02:16:06,803
Hmm?

2191
02:16:07,115 --> 02:16:07,693
Hmm.

2192
02:16:24,142 --> 02:16:25,853
Where have you been?
You said that you’d come yesterday, right?

2193
02:16:26,120 --> 02:16:27,815
Why did you not attend the wedding?

2194
02:16:28,139 --> 02:16:30,154
What wedding? A wedding
of mother and son, is it?

2195
02:16:30,186 --> 02:16:32,966
Stop diverting my mind and say it.

2196
02:16:33,506 --> 02:16:36,162
I spent all day with Karthik yesterday.

2197
02:16:36,318 --> 02:16:36,967
Yes.

2198
02:16:38,217 --> 02:16:41,052
I love Karthik.
- Are you mad?

2199
02:16:41,154 --> 02:16:42,147
He is a flirt.

2200
02:16:42,811 --> 02:16:43,631
He is perfect.

2201
02:16:44,193 --> 02:16:49,584
He is great to understand me
even though I misunderstood him.

2202
02:16:51,114 --> 02:16:55,474
I tried to selfishly make me follow me.

2203
02:16:57,014 --> 02:16:59,826
He made me his love for life.

2204
02:16:59,873 --> 02:17:01,966
You fell for someone!

2205
02:17:01,991 --> 02:17:04,889
That means he must
have something impressive.

2206
02:17:05,779 --> 02:17:07,506
Oh! I guess your man is here.

2207
02:17:07,717 --> 02:17:08,522
Shut up.

2208
02:17:11,115 --> 02:17:11,717
Dad.

2209
02:17:12,497 --> 02:17:13,154
You?

2210
02:17:13,912 --> 02:17:14,717
Please come.

2211
02:17:14,772 --> 02:17:17,287
Why did your father come
instead of your would-be?

2212
02:17:19,436 --> 02:17:21,646
How are you, uncle?

2213
02:17:22,232 --> 02:17:23,061
I am good.

2214
02:17:23,379 --> 02:17:24,926
Fruits? I will cut them.

2215
02:17:25,496 --> 02:17:26,449
Silly girl.

2216
02:17:27,418 --> 02:17:30,058
Uma. I want to talk to you for a moment.

2217
02:17:31,050 --> 02:17:32,785
What is your opinion on Karthik?

2218
02:17:32,957 --> 02:17:33,754
Dad?

2219
02:17:33,879 --> 02:17:35,637
He takes care of her daughter so well.

2220
02:17:35,808 --> 02:17:38,027
I am sure he will take care
of his wife very well too.

2221
02:17:38,113 --> 02:17:40,027
I can understand it as a father.

2222
02:17:41,254 --> 02:17:43,746
Why give you to a man who
doesn’t know to talk or understand?

2223
02:17:44,097 --> 02:17:49,058
It is better to get you married to a
well-known guy and a friendly guy.

2224
02:17:50,073 --> 02:17:51,527
I am not forcing you.

2225
02:17:51,879 --> 02:17:54,441
We can go to Karthik’s
house if you like my proposal.

2226
02:18:05,164 --> 02:18:06,445
Is someone home?

2227
02:18:06,672 --> 02:18:08,453
He will be at home, dad.

2228
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:31,031
Hey…

2229
02:18:34,687 --> 02:18:35,289
Uma?

2230
02:18:37,859 --> 02:18:39,086
In-laws!

2231
02:18:40,460 --> 02:18:41,898
Uncle! He is my father.

2232
02:18:42,037 --> 02:18:43,545
Greetings.
- Hi, bro.

2233
02:18:46,662 --> 02:18:50,662
We misunderstood the relation between
you and Uma when you came to our place.

2234
02:18:50,834 --> 02:18:54,966
But, I want that misunderstanding
to become true now.

2235
02:18:55,412 --> 02:18:58,967
I am planning to get Uma married
to you if you and your father agree.

2236
02:19:05,615 --> 02:19:07,600
Karthik! Why don’t you say something?

2237
02:19:08,357 --> 02:19:09,748
Chitti…

2238
02:19:09,850 --> 02:19:11,928
I want to talk about it too.

2239
02:19:12,739 --> 02:19:15,599
I know how you take care
of your daughter, Karthik.

2240
02:19:16,592 --> 02:19:20,896
I assure you that Uma shall take
care of Chitti like her own daughter.

2241
02:19:22,583 --> 02:19:24,771
Brother-in-law! Why do say
that she is Karthik’s daughter?

2242
02:19:24,935 --> 02:19:26,935
What is it?
Why is he saying that she is your daughter?

2243
02:19:27,146 --> 02:19:28,232
Dad! That is…

2244
02:19:28,271 --> 02:19:30,990
We know about Karthik’s first wife.
- First wife?

2245
02:19:32,107 --> 02:19:33,678
You think Chitti is his daughter?

2246
02:19:33,756 --> 02:19:35,764
Who do you think is the father of Chitti?

2247
02:19:35,912 --> 02:19:39,100
She is my daughter
I made her.

2248
02:19:39,178 --> 02:19:40,615
Dad! Stop it.
- Why?

2249
02:19:41,006 --> 02:19:42,927
He considers my daughter as his daughter.

2250
02:19:42,952 --> 02:19:43,905
Isn’t it, Uma?

2251
02:19:44,514 --> 02:19:45,857
Am I right, dad?

2252
02:19:45,942 --> 02:19:47,396
No, dear.

2253
02:19:47,490 --> 02:19:50,021
Why would I consider your daughter as mine?

2254
02:19:50,060 --> 02:19:51,920
I will consider my daughter as mine.

2255
02:19:52,014 --> 02:19:53,599
Stop it
Brother-in-law!

2256
02:19:53,982 --> 02:19:55,514
It might sound funny.

2257
02:19:55,725 --> 02:19:56,639
I am 60!

2258
02:19:57,006 --> 02:19:58,318
I made her at the age of 60.

2259
02:19:58,756 --> 02:19:59,881
Can anyone do that?

2260
02:20:01,006 --> 02:20:03,107
Is anyone that strong?

2261
02:20:03,404 --> 02:20:07,396
Not just 60! I will make babies
during my 70’s or even 80’s.

2262
02:20:07,646 --> 02:20:09,209
Can you do that?

2263
02:20:10,294 --> 02:20:12,693
Why is he bragging about his strengths?
- I heard you.

2264
02:20:12,756 --> 02:20:13,678
I want you to hear.

2265
02:20:17,599 --> 02:20:21,263
I did not marry but Kalyani
gave this baby as a gift to me.

2266
02:20:22,029 --> 02:20:22,568
See!

2267
02:20:22,716 --> 02:20:25,513
She got angry that we are discussing her
brother's wedding without letting her know.

2268
02:20:25,880 --> 02:20:27,497
She is just like me.
- Buddy!

2269
02:20:27,591 --> 02:20:29,248
It is your brother’s wedding!

2270
02:20:29,389 --> 02:20:30,693
I am so happy.

2271
02:20:31,092 --> 02:20:33,037
I don’t know what all I gave him.

2272
02:20:33,209 --> 02:20:35,678
But, let this wedding be the best.

2273
02:20:35,749 --> 02:20:37,693
I was worried about
solving your love problem.

2274
02:20:37,756 --> 02:20:39,420
It is cleared simply.

2275
02:20:39,638 --> 02:20:40,951
Let’s go
We shall play.

2276
02:20:43,521 --> 02:20:45,865
Let them discuss
We shall go and play.

2277
02:21:00,162 --> 02:21:01,506
Dad...

2278
02:21:03,506 --> 02:21:05,365
I sent you here with great hope.

2279
02:21:05,818 --> 02:21:08,623
You did crazy things and made me crazy now.

2280
02:21:09,459 --> 02:21:11,842
What is his age and why
is he a father of a baby?

2281
02:21:12,053 --> 02:21:13,771
Did Karthik and you love each other?

2282
02:21:14,060 --> 02:21:15,803
What’s happening?
- Uncle! That is…

2283
02:21:17,842 --> 02:21:19,560
I want you to live a good life.

2284
02:21:19,748 --> 02:21:21,029
But, you crossed your limits.

2285
02:21:31,149 --> 02:21:32,766
Is your love story all done?

2286
02:21:33,055 --> 02:21:34,922
Chitti played till now and slept.

2287
02:21:35,165 --> 02:21:36,829
Why did he suddenly propose the wedding?

2288
02:21:37,337 --> 02:21:38,673
A wedding isn't a small thing.

2289
02:21:39,243 --> 02:21:42,556
That too, it is the great
Fani Bhoopal son’s wedding.

2290
02:21:43,273 --> 02:21:45,695
It should be a grand wedding.

2291
02:21:45,907 --> 02:21:49,181
It is more like a celebrity
destination wedding.

2292
02:21:49,876 --> 02:21:51,852
It should happen the way I wanted it.

2293
02:21:52,259 --> 02:21:55,157
We should have a drink
on this happy occasion.

2294
02:21:55,182 --> 02:21:57,338
Hold this...Cheers!

2295
02:21:57,602 --> 02:21:58,329
Have it.

2296
02:22:05,290 --> 02:22:06,501
Drink it, dad.

2297
02:22:06,962 --> 02:22:09,532
Why? Can’t you drink it
if I pour it on your face?

2298
02:22:10,063 --> 02:22:12,274
Your happiness is just like that.

2299
02:22:12,931 --> 02:22:14,032
I cannot take it anymore.

2300
02:22:18,056 --> 02:22:20,618
Joke!

2301
02:22:20,742 --> 02:22:22,648
Isn’t it? Come here.

2302
02:22:29,290 --> 02:22:31,766
I tried to hide one fact to save my love.

2303
02:22:32,477 --> 02:22:34,657
Everything collapsed
in a jiffy because of you.

2304
02:22:36,782 --> 02:22:40,376
Dad! I proudly say that you are the
reason for my happy and secure life.

2305
02:22:41,860 --> 02:22:44,259
But now, you became my problem.

2306
02:22:46,149 --> 02:22:47,125
All is over.

2307
02:22:47,274 --> 02:22:49,102
One more girl walked away
from my life because of you.

2308
02:22:49,368 --> 02:22:51,251
It is just you, Chitti, and I. That is it.

2309
02:22:51,540 --> 02:22:53,735
We have no one and there won’t be any.

2310
02:22:59,727 --> 02:23:01,665
Freshen up and come
Let’s eat.

2311
02:23:16,906 --> 02:23:19,875
“Look at me
“You are now going to get my face”

2312
02:23:19,900 --> 02:23:22,642
“You are now going to get me right
You know me”

2313
02:23:22,953 --> 02:23:25,031
“I am my enemy”

2314
02:23:25,094 --> 02:23:27,914
“Look at me
“You are now going to get my face”

2315
02:23:28,009 --> 02:23:30,275
“You are now going to see
that my eyes are reading"

2316
02:23:30,338 --> 02:23:31,205
"You just see”

2317
02:23:31,361 --> 02:23:33,384
“I am an ecstasy”

2318
02:23:33,462 --> 02:23:35,619
“Come play with me”

2319
02:23:36,392 --> 02:23:38,650
“O’ my cutie, O’ my hottie”

2320
02:23:38,720 --> 02:23:40,494
“Just be with me”

2321
02:23:40,572 --> 02:23:42,080
“O’ my beauty”

2322
02:23:42,916 --> 02:23:44,978
“Douse in with me”

2323
02:23:45,056 --> 02:23:47,048
“O’ my Barbie, O’ my baby”

2324
02:23:47,142 --> 02:23:49,947
“Don’t go away from me”

2325
02:23:50,048 --> 02:23:53,493
“We’ll be one”

2326
02:23:54,166 --> 02:23:58,235
“That was fun”

2327
02:23:58,376 --> 02:24:02,392
“Have I won?”

2328
02:24:02,666 --> 02:24:06,734
“O’ my son!”

2329
02:24:23,390 --> 02:24:24,757
This doesn’t look like a party.

2330
02:24:25,031 --> 02:24:26,687
It is more like a memorial.

2331
02:24:28,367 --> 02:24:30,734
How long will you think
about it and be sad?

2332
02:24:32,680 --> 02:24:34,609
We won’t feel sad looking
at an empty bottle, right?

2333
02:24:34,836 --> 02:24:36,234
We will buy a new one.

2334
02:24:36,499 --> 02:24:37,617
Life is just the same.

2335
02:24:41,023 --> 02:24:43,234
My example might be silly.

2336
02:24:43,976 --> 02:24:46,391
But, I want you to understand
the sense of my expression.

2337
02:24:47,984 --> 02:24:50,226
His wedding got canceled because of me.

2338
02:24:50,570 --> 02:24:52,375
It is not because of you
It is because of that baby.

2339
02:24:52,531 --> 02:24:53,914
It is because of Chitti.

2340
02:24:54,070 --> 02:24:56,969
You should have gotten rid of
her but you brought her home.

2341
02:24:57,508 --> 02:25:00,547
You wouldn’t be in this situation
if you had not thought about her.

2342
02:25:00,594 --> 02:25:02,773
There are many orphanages in this country.

2343
02:25:03,733 --> 02:25:06,975
You should have left her somewhere
But, no! You brought her home.

2344
02:25:08,648 --> 02:25:09,766
Your son is Rahul.

2345
02:25:10,742 --> 02:25:11,789
He is your lone son.

2346
02:25:12,883 --> 02:25:14,875
You sent him to stay in the
hostel during his first grade.

2347
02:25:15,961 --> 02:25:18,219
He will come home two
times a year like a relative.

2348
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:22,859
How many times did you
see him in these 20 years?

2349
02:25:24,828 --> 02:25:25,844
40 times, is it?

2350
02:25:27,336 --> 02:25:28,398
He has everyone.

2351
02:25:29,148 --> 02:25:33,172
But, he spends his time with books
and cannot that love from his parents.

2352
02:25:33,961 --> 02:25:36,531
You may not think
anything better than that.

2353
02:25:36,866 --> 02:25:39,913
I cannot have children to get rid of them.

2354
02:25:40,133 --> 02:25:41,148
No.

2355
02:25:48,138 --> 02:25:49,138
It is a mosquito.

2356
02:25:49,481 --> 02:25:51,935
It is sucking your blood
So, I killed it.

2357
02:25:53,748 --> 02:25:54,295
Yes.

2358
02:25:54,873 --> 02:25:56,060
There are many mosquitoes here.

2359
02:25:56,085 --> 02:25:58,591
There are mosquitoes here
Eat and sleep.

2360
02:25:58,709 --> 02:25:59,709
Did you hear it?

2361
02:26:09,818 --> 02:26:10,599
Kalyani!

2362
02:26:12,904 --> 02:26:13,966
Okay, cut!

2363
02:26:14,248 --> 02:26:15,778
Hey! How long do you need?
Come.

2364
02:26:17,591 --> 02:26:19,123
She might be a prostitute.

2365
02:26:19,482 --> 02:26:20,795
But, she is the heroine of my ad.

2366
02:26:20,896 --> 02:26:22,677
Do you know why I selected her?

2367
02:26:22,716 --> 02:26:26,287
Their professionalism might lift
our product and make it a success.

2368
02:26:26,459 --> 02:26:30,560
And, they never force someone,
cause trouble or make anyone sad.

2369
02:26:31,240 --> 02:26:34,756
Their profession gives 100
percent satisfaction to people.

2370
02:26:35,529 --> 02:26:37,224
They do it to make living.

2371
02:26:37,645 --> 02:26:40,122
They do it to just make living.

2372
02:26:40,412 --> 02:26:41,381
Underline!

2373
02:26:42,232 --> 02:26:42,896
Go.

2374
02:26:44,146 --> 02:26:46,131
Kalyani! Get ready for the shot.

2375
02:26:53,498 --> 02:26:54,115
Hello.

2376
02:26:54,959 --> 02:26:56,045
What is all this?

2377
02:26:56,334 --> 02:26:58,724
Sorry, sir
Water came in due to heavy rain.

2378
02:26:58,865 --> 02:27:01,373
I will set up everything if
you give me half an hour. - Half an hour?

2379
02:27:01,692 --> 02:27:03,216
Like this!
- Sir?

2380
02:27:03,888 --> 02:27:05,076
Hi.
- Hi.

2381
02:27:05,318 --> 02:27:06,482
Why do you damp?

2382
02:27:06,568 --> 02:27:08,114
We get wet in the rain like this.

2383
02:27:08,818 --> 02:27:09,693
Just joking!

2384
02:27:09,795 --> 02:27:10,997
How long do you need?
- If you don’t mind,

2385
02:27:11,022 --> 02:27:12,694
you can wait in my room for some time.

2386
02:27:13,388 --> 02:27:14,795
I guess it will be done. Isn’t it?

2387
02:27:14,935 --> 02:27:17,685
10 minutes, okay?
- Someone might think badly about it?

2388
02:27:18,787 --> 02:27:20,795
Kalyani! Let’s go.

2389
02:27:24,381 --> 02:27:25,802
Do you want some tea?
- Sure.

2390
02:27:26,785 --> 02:27:27,810
I will make it.

2391
02:27:38,232 --> 02:27:39,396
Do you know something?

2392
02:27:39,857 --> 02:27:42,037
Many people desired my body.

2393
02:27:42,295 --> 02:27:45,607
But for the first time, my body wants you.

2394
02:27:46,341 --> 02:27:48,662
For me, my body is my heart.

2395
02:27:49,084 --> 02:27:51,341
Why because my life is like that.

2396
02:27:51,920 --> 02:27:54,326
I never experienced love.

2397
02:27:54,795 --> 02:27:58,614
But I think this is love.

2398
02:27:59,857 --> 02:28:02,873
You may or may not come into my life again.

2399
02:28:03,185 --> 02:28:07,779
But, the moments I spend with you
would be lovable memories to me.

2400
02:28:07,951 --> 02:28:10,584
Kalyani left and I got
a call from her one day.

2401
02:28:10,888 --> 02:28:12,927
She met with an accident
and her life is in danger.

2402
02:28:13,638 --> 02:28:14,654
Kalyani.

2403
02:28:18,442 --> 02:28:24,310
I wanted to treasure the moments I spent
with you that day as a lifelong memory.

2404
02:28:25,732 --> 02:28:29,825
God blessed me with Chitti as a memory.

2405
02:28:29,927 --> 02:28:30,810
Chitti?

2406
02:28:31,201 --> 02:28:32,693
They said that I would not survive.

2407
02:28:33,154 --> 02:28:39,669
I was worried if I’d
show Chitti to you or not.

2408
02:28:40,474 --> 02:28:42,833
I cannot take care of her like a father.

2409
02:28:43,441 --> 02:28:47,747
I cannot come to you because of her.

2410
02:28:47,873 --> 02:28:49,834
I decided to go far away from you.

2411
02:28:50,670 --> 02:28:51,693
I made a mistake.

2412
02:28:52,232 --> 02:28:56,950
So, I am taken away forever.

2413
02:28:57,670 --> 02:28:58,841
My love is true.

2414
02:28:59,216 --> 02:29:04,403
That’s why the symbol
of our love is left to you.

2415
02:29:14,138 --> 02:29:18,536
Chitti is born to Kalyani
who changed because of you.

2416
02:29:22,060 --> 02:29:25,146
I was blank when I saw Chitti.

2417
02:29:25,810 --> 02:29:28,865
Karthik is before me
when I came to my senses.

2418
02:29:37,654 --> 02:29:41,544
“Whatever I do is right to me
Whatever you do is right to you”

2419
02:29:41,585 --> 02:29:45,567
“Whatever is right to you and me
could be the wrong to me and you”

2420
02:29:45,591 --> 02:29:47,934
"Whatever I want is
straight from the heart"

2421
02:29:47,975 --> 02:29:49,958
“Whatever I want is parasocial”

2422
02:29:49,983 --> 02:29:53,778
“Don’t bother what the
world talks and treats you”

2423
02:29:53,873 --> 02:29:55,708
“There’s a lot of feeling”

2424
02:29:55,903 --> 02:29:57,888
“With a lot of healing”

2425
02:29:58,075 --> 02:30:00,013
“In the world of failing”

2426
02:30:00,068 --> 02:30:04,427
“Even I am falling
I am so high”

2427
02:30:05,990 --> 02:30:08,685
“I wanna fly”

2428
02:30:09,890 --> 02:30:12,164
“I am so high”

2429
02:30:13,351 --> 02:30:17,273
Chitti! Your brother had
an issue because of us.

2430
02:30:17,695 --> 02:30:19,179
We have to solve that.

2431
02:30:19,351 --> 02:30:20,046
Okay.

2432
02:30:27,546 --> 02:30:28,835
Go and give it to your father.

2433
02:30:33,140 --> 02:30:33,983
Go!

2434
02:30:39,968 --> 02:30:41,250
Dad! Tea.

2435
02:30:43,140 --> 02:30:44,320
Dad! Wait.

2436
02:30:44,937 --> 02:30:46,398
I sure did lie.

2437
02:30:47,390 --> 02:30:48,460
But, I did not deceive you.

2438
02:30:49,062 --> 02:30:50,398
Both are the same.

2439
02:30:50,960 --> 02:30:52,108
There is, dad.

2440
02:30:52,357 --> 02:30:55,615
If we lie to make
someone happy, it’s a favor.

2441
02:30:56,342 --> 02:30:59,452
But if we lie due to
selfishness, it is deceit.

2442
02:31:00,686 --> 02:31:03,819
When we lie to save the wedding.

2443
02:31:04,327 --> 02:31:08,514
I don’t think whatever I lied
for the sake of Chitti is wrong.

2444
02:31:10,233 --> 02:31:14,514
I cannot accept it if loving
Karthik was crossing my limits.

2445
02:31:15,295 --> 02:31:18,131
When Karthik came here,
everyone liked him.

2446
02:31:18,702 --> 02:31:20,819
Similarly, I loved him.

2447
02:31:21,874 --> 02:31:23,014
A little earlier!

2448
02:31:24,530 --> 02:31:27,327
Dad! What is your problem, dad?

2449
02:31:28,053 --> 02:31:29,420
Is it because I lied?

2450
02:31:30,874 --> 02:31:32,350
Is it because I loved Karthik?

2451
02:31:32,561 --> 02:31:34,413
Or is it because his father has a daughter?

2452
02:31:35,795 --> 02:31:39,279
You might behave like
this because of tenacity.

2453
02:31:39,304 --> 02:31:45,920
But, you do not understand
how I feel if you stop talking to me.

2454
02:31:50,858 --> 02:31:51,506
Jerry.

2455
02:31:53,412 --> 02:31:53,904
Jerry?

2456
02:31:55,249 --> 02:31:56,038
Jerry!

2457
02:31:56,170 --> 02:31:58,397
Hey! I did not find him.
- I did not find him either.

2458
02:31:58,639 --> 02:31:59,350
Call him.

2459
02:31:59,631 --> 02:32:00,936
I did, he is not picking up.

2460
02:32:01,374 --> 02:32:02,866
Uncle! Did dad come to your house?

2461
02:32:02,975 --> 02:32:04,100
He came last night.

2462
02:32:04,202 --> 02:32:05,428
He had half bottle of alcohol.

2463
02:32:05,717 --> 02:32:07,311
Not half, I guess he finished it.

2464
02:32:07,365 --> 02:32:08,623
Okay. I will call you again.

2465
02:32:10,873 --> 02:32:13,365
Where do you think he might have gone?
Where did he go?

2466
02:32:14,264 --> 02:32:15,272
Did he leave me and go?

2467
02:32:16,194 --> 02:32:17,318
Did he go to Uma’s house?

2468
02:32:17,827 --> 02:32:19,991
I don’t want him to get
humiliated by going there.

2469
02:32:20,913 --> 02:32:22,662
I have to stop him before he reaches there.

2470
02:32:25,034 --> 02:32:26,534
How can our channel grow like this?

2471
02:32:28,755 --> 02:32:31,564
Everyone who has an email ID
created a YouTube channel to flourish.

2472
02:32:31,605 --> 02:32:33,894
What about us?
- Their thumbnails are indifferent, sir.

2473
02:32:34,009 --> 02:32:37,107
To be the top in this competitive world,

2474
02:32:37,544 --> 02:32:40,404
Create captions that
will capture the public.

2475
02:32:40,654 --> 02:32:41,365
Hey, Suresh.

2476
02:32:41,482 --> 02:32:44,794
What did that Malayali actress Zia Karrier
say about ice cream in her interview?

2477
02:32:45,061 --> 02:32:48,498
She said that she'd secretly
escape the house to have ice cream.

2478
02:32:48,589 --> 02:32:50,847
What would you keep the title for it?

2479
02:32:50,872 --> 02:32:52,229
A heroine who jumps
off the wall for ice cream!

2480
02:32:52,284 --> 02:32:55,120
How is the title, sir?
- They might dislike it.

2481
02:32:55,245 --> 02:32:56,284
We won’t get views.

2482
02:32:56,425 --> 02:32:58,612
Ready to do anything for it!

2483
02:32:58,691 --> 02:33:01,674
Ready to do this for that!

2484
02:33:02,394 --> 02:33:04,941
People would be curious to know what it is.

2485
02:33:05,527 --> 02:33:07,566
Do you know what kind of viewers exists?

2486
02:33:07,698 --> 02:33:09,331
When they see this title,

2487
02:33:09,894 --> 02:33:13,698
Desirous guys…

2488
02:33:14,144 --> 02:33:19,768
might get a tingly feeling,

2489
02:33:20,745 --> 02:33:21,964
and act silly!

2490
02:33:22,011 --> 02:33:22,722
Where?

2491
02:33:26,089 --> 02:33:28,089
I mean they will click on the video.

2492
02:33:28,573 --> 02:33:29,416
Do you get it?
- Boss!

2493
02:33:29,441 --> 02:33:30,824
I have interesting news.
- Damn…this guy!

2494
02:33:30,870 --> 02:33:32,081
Tell me.

2495
02:33:32,175 --> 02:33:32,831
Boss.

2496
02:33:33,144 --> 02:33:33,753
Hi.

2497
02:33:33,878 --> 02:33:34,769
My name is Karthik.

2498
02:33:35,081 --> 02:33:36,565
I stay at Jubilee Hills in Hyderabad.

2499
02:33:37,033 --> 02:33:39,103
I don’t have another choice
So, I am recording this video.

2500
02:33:39,331 --> 02:33:41,050
My father and I fought.

2501
02:33:41,378 --> 02:33:43,706
So, my dad left home with my daughter.

2502
02:33:44,183 --> 02:33:46,323
I intend to stop him before
he moves out of the city.

2503
02:33:46,612 --> 02:33:48,870
Even I report to the cops,
nothing will happen in a short time.

2504
02:33:49,136 --> 02:33:52,487
So, I seek your help through social media.

2505
02:33:52,652 --> 02:33:53,941
He is my father Fani Bhoopal.

2506
02:33:54,112 --> 02:33:55,175
She is my daughter Chitti.

2507
02:33:55,268 --> 02:33:56,128
Awesome!

2508
02:33:56,550 --> 02:33:58,573
Boss! This news isn’t spread yet.

2509
02:33:58,612 --> 02:34:01,230
Before this video goes viral on YouTube,

2510
02:34:01,534 --> 02:34:03,652
We should release the first video.

2511
02:34:03,894 --> 02:34:05,612
We have half an hour to do it.

2512
02:34:05,729 --> 02:34:06,136
Go!

2513
02:34:06,166 --> 02:34:09,128
This is an unheard story of kidnap.

2514
02:34:09,175 --> 02:34:12,027
It is a strange incident that
doesn’t happen even in movies.

2515
02:34:12,159 --> 02:34:16,128
It is grandpa's act of
abducting his granddaughter.

2516
02:34:16,206 --> 02:34:18,331
Father on one end

2517
02:34:18,503 --> 02:34:20,995
Daughter on the other end.

2518
02:34:21,020 --> 02:34:24,231
A guy struggles between
these two troublesome bonds.

2519
02:34:26,573 --> 02:34:27,816
This is Karthik’s story.

2520
02:34:28,565 --> 02:34:32,815
People who want to support Karthik.

2521
02:34:32,870 --> 02:34:35,816
Please like and share
this video immediately.

2522
02:34:36,300 --> 02:34:37,167
Please…

2523
02:34:37,253 --> 02:34:39,402
Subscribe to our channel.

2524
02:34:40,127 --> 02:34:42,674
Well done, Excellent…
- Thank you, boss.

2525
02:34:42,752 --> 02:34:46,549
Wait and see
We’ll get so many views.

2526
02:34:46,831 --> 02:34:49,589
Let us name this operation FCK!

2527
02:34:49,706 --> 02:34:50,917
What is FCK, boss?

2528
02:34:51,002 --> 02:34:54,292
F is Fani...C is Chitti...
K is Karthik.

2529
02:34:58,237 --> 02:34:59,878
Chakri! See this.

2530
02:35:00,027 --> 02:35:01,980
He is Karthik, right?
- Yes, He is Karthik.

2531
02:35:02,097 --> 02:35:04,323
He helped our relation.
- Yes.

2532
02:35:04,409 --> 02:35:05,480
We have to help him.

2533
02:35:05,698 --> 02:35:08,691
Let’s spread this video and do what we can.

2534
02:35:08,831 --> 02:35:09,753
Share it with me.

2535
02:35:13,456 --> 02:35:19,393
I cannot digest what you
say about Karthik’s father Fani.

2536
02:35:19,534 --> 02:35:21,636
Who do you think Chitti is?

2537
02:35:22,011 --> 02:35:23,597
She is not Karthik’s daughter.

2538
02:35:23,722 --> 02:35:25,589
Karthik is not married yet.

2539
02:35:25,730 --> 02:35:27,730
She is his baby.

2540
02:35:27,987 --> 02:35:30,683
He will go away with his
baby wherever he wants to.

2541
02:35:30,791 --> 02:35:33,518
What is your problem?
- Okay.

2542
02:35:33,675 --> 02:35:35,230
What is Karthik’s problem now?

2543
02:35:35,307 --> 02:35:37,964
The problem is not with Karthik.

2544
02:35:38,206 --> 02:35:42,799
Karthik's girlfriend Uma's
father Mr. Raghavaiah is an issue.

2545
02:35:43,152 --> 02:35:45,206
Dude! See this.

2546
02:35:45,895 --> 02:35:48,682
He is worried about why he would send his
daughter to a house an old man has a baby.

2547
02:35:48,799 --> 02:35:51,666
Hey! Add U in FCK!
- It might become a bad word, boss.

2548
02:35:51,797 --> 02:35:55,635
He is stubborn about it.

2549
02:35:56,370 --> 02:35:59,503
Silly fellow! Don’t you have creativity?

2550
02:35:59,776 --> 02:36:02,870
Add U in a different place.

2551
02:36:03,141 --> 02:36:04,501
Operation FCUK!

2552
02:36:04,526 --> 02:36:05,729
Super, boss!

2553
02:36:07,027 --> 02:36:12,214
“Lord Krishna is here”

2554
02:36:12,253 --> 02:36:16,424
"Lord Krishna is here”

2555
02:36:17,713 --> 02:36:18,541
Sir…

2556
02:36:18,784 --> 02:36:20,104
I want your interview.

2557
02:36:21,798 --> 02:36:23,400
I will change my dress.

2558
02:36:23,448 --> 02:36:25,268
We don’t care about your dress, sir
Give us the interview.

2559
02:36:25,940 --> 02:36:26,948
No way!

2560
02:36:27,487 --> 02:36:29,104
Why does lockdown repeat?

2561
02:36:29,316 --> 02:36:31,362
I don’t like it…

2562
02:36:32,463 --> 02:36:35,268
Who is asking about that?
It has been so long that it is over.

2563
02:36:35,316 --> 02:36:36,777
Then, why do you want to take an interview?

2564
02:36:37,019 --> 02:36:40,323
It is about your friend
Fani’s daughter Chitti.

2565
02:36:40,448 --> 02:36:41,277
Oh!

2566
02:36:41,619 --> 02:36:45,603
Do you know that Chitti is a
daughter of Fani and prostitute Kalyani?

2567
02:36:45,721 --> 02:36:47,322
You said it now.

2568
02:36:48,478 --> 02:36:51,314
The public shall know about it soon.

2569
02:36:53,971 --> 02:36:54,580
Tell me.

2570
02:36:54,807 --> 02:36:56,072
Did you check the video I sent on Whatsapp?

2571
02:36:56,369 --> 02:36:57,900
People are talking nonsense.
- What?

2572
02:36:58,150 --> 02:36:59,017
Check it first.

2573
02:37:04,150 --> 02:37:09,915
Do you know that Chitti is a
daughter of Fani and prostitute Kalyani?

2574
02:37:17,596 --> 02:37:18,666
Hello, Karthik.

2575
02:37:18,807 --> 02:37:20,783
Aunty! just now saw that video.

2576
02:37:20,955 --> 02:37:21,900
Why did uncle do that?

2577
02:37:22,001 --> 02:37:26,509
Your father didn’t do anything wrong.
His act enlightens people’s thoughts.

2578
02:37:26,876 --> 02:37:29,337
He never thought lowly
that she is a prostitute's baby.

2579
02:37:30,501 --> 02:37:33,689
He only thought about his
responsibility as a father.

2580
02:37:33,993 --> 02:37:38,298
He proved that he is kind
than many people in this society.

2581
02:37:38,564 --> 02:37:39,493
It is okay, Karthik.

2582
02:37:39,853 --> 02:37:41,048
Let people know.

2583
02:37:41,290 --> 02:37:43,564
That way many people might change.

2584
02:37:45,001 --> 02:37:50,352
“Lord Krishna is here”

2585
02:37:52,236 --> 02:37:53,556
Hello! Welcome to focus time.

2586
02:37:53,587 --> 02:37:56,876
Mr. Babu Ragineni and
Jagannadh are here in the studio.

2587
02:37:57,079 --> 02:37:58,118
Let’s talk to them.

2588
02:37:58,564 --> 02:38:00,094
Fani had a baby in his 60s.

2589
02:38:00,173 --> 02:38:02,267
Mr. Raghavaiah couldn't digest the fact.

2590
02:38:02,368 --> 02:38:05,454
Karthik and Uma lost their
love because of these two.

2591
02:38:05,852 --> 02:38:07,775
Chitti doesn’t know
anything about the world.

2592
02:38:07,829 --> 02:38:10,157
Tell me now
Whose fault is it?

2593
02:38:10,182 --> 02:38:11,439
[BOTH]: At the age of 60…

2594
02:38:12,259 --> 02:38:14,915
You say.
- How can he have a baby at the age of 60?

2595
02:38:14,940 --> 02:38:17,970
He should care about society, right?

2596
02:38:18,048 --> 02:38:20,407
I wouldn’t accept their marriage
just like Mr. Raghavaiah.

2597
02:38:20,540 --> 02:38:22,103
No one wants your approval.

2598
02:38:22,181 --> 02:38:23,626
What do you mean?

2599
02:38:23,651 --> 02:38:28,813
Do you think we get weak at
that age or should we be like you?

2600
02:38:29,361 --> 02:38:30,579
What are you talking?
- Sit! Why are you leaving?

2601
02:38:30,611 --> 02:38:31,673
Don’t talk about personal matters.

2602
02:38:31,704 --> 02:38:34,782
You should consider your
age when you do something.

2603
02:38:34,853 --> 02:38:36,759
I know you might say that.

2604
02:38:36,908 --> 02:38:38,650
Hey! Get it.

2605
02:38:39,494 --> 02:38:40,697
What do you like?

2606
02:38:40,759 --> 02:38:42,744
How can I say that?
- Say what you like.

2607
02:38:42,798 --> 02:38:46,665
I love Gulab Jamun for sure
because it is lip-smacking

2608
02:38:46,908 --> 02:38:50,009
I cannot express how I
feel about Chilly fritters! It is hot!

2609
02:38:50,056 --> 02:38:52,228
He is around 60…62, right?

2610
02:38:52,253 --> 02:38:54,206
Ask me.
- I thought you would not like to answer.

2611
02:38:54,290 --> 02:38:55,369
Okay. Leave it.

2612
02:38:55,869 --> 02:38:57,486
Why don’t you stop eating these?

2613
02:38:57,511 --> 02:38:59,759
You can give up at least one.
- How can I?

2614
02:38:59,829 --> 02:39:01,533
Taste buds don’t work based on age.

2615
02:39:01,603 --> 02:39:04,806
That is what I am trying to convey
Desire is not based on age.

2616
02:39:04,861 --> 02:39:06,494
Both are longings.

2617
02:39:06,548 --> 02:39:08,134
According to few surveys...

2618
02:39:08,212 --> 02:39:16,290
A man's ejaculation takes 33
seconds to 44 minutes during intimacy.

2619
02:39:16,556 --> 02:39:18,119
Will 10 minutes be sufficient for you?

2620
02:39:18,165 --> 02:39:22,126
I mean can you cut short a few
minutes for the sake of society?

2621
02:39:22,228 --> 02:39:24,290
Please don’t mind
This is just my subject.

2622
02:39:24,336 --> 02:39:25,969
It is a personal thing.

2623
02:39:26,118 --> 02:39:29,091
Oh! Time taken is personal.

2624
02:39:29,209 --> 02:39:31,459
But, age is not personal, is it?

2625
02:39:31,490 --> 02:39:36,420
How can you decide about
intimacy and having kids?

2626
02:39:36,576 --> 02:39:40,263
The Supreme court gave a verdict
that it should be mutual consent.

2627
02:39:40,451 --> 02:39:43,943
Why because it is completely individual.

2628
02:39:44,123 --> 02:39:46,092
No one has the right to question.

2629
02:39:46,342 --> 02:39:49,349
What do you mean?

2630
02:39:49,404 --> 02:39:50,959
When a partner dies at a young age,

2631
02:39:51,029 --> 02:39:52,842
people control feelings
for the sake of their kids.

2632
02:39:52,867 --> 02:39:55,703
Are you making fun of such parents?

2633
02:39:56,108 --> 02:40:00,099
No! Single parents never think
about what they have missed.

2634
02:40:00,256 --> 02:40:03,842
Such feelings are controlled
because of some commitments.

2635
02:40:03,967 --> 02:40:04,670
Sit.

2636
02:40:04,889 --> 02:40:05,889
Where are you going, dad?

2637
02:40:06,279 --> 02:40:08,264
I recalled what I missed.

2638
02:40:08,787 --> 02:40:10,662
I gave you everything you wanted.

2639
02:40:11,287 --> 02:40:13,302
I am going to get what I want now.

2640
02:40:13,592 --> 02:40:18,045
Commitments should make
people happy without any issues.

2641
02:40:18,131 --> 02:40:19,732
But they should be a problem.

2642
02:40:19,826 --> 02:40:22,795
How can he have a baby with a prostitute?

2643
02:40:22,912 --> 02:40:25,849
What if the girl becomes like her mother?
It is a shame to society.

2644
02:40:25,874 --> 02:40:27,919
Just a minute!
Apsara is on a video call with us.

2645
02:40:27,943 --> 02:40:28,904
Let’s talk to her.

2646
02:40:29,138 --> 02:40:31,247
Do you think we are not humans?

2647
02:40:31,342 --> 02:40:32,654
Do you think we don’t have emotions?

2648
02:40:32,685 --> 02:40:35,013
Do they really care about emotions?

2649
02:40:36,467 --> 02:40:38,998
Why don’t you do something
else if you feel that way?

2650
02:40:39,023 --> 02:40:40,271
Why did you choose prostitution?

2651
02:40:40,357 --> 02:40:44,419
I am sick of hearing the
same thing again and again.

2652
02:40:44,793 --> 02:40:49,864
We wear colorful sarees, put
on ornaments, and call for you.

2653
02:40:50,324 --> 02:40:52,732
All you can see are those actions.

2654
02:40:52,795 --> 02:40:56,138
You never understand our pain or our tears.

2655
02:40:56,474 --> 02:40:59,357
Do you think we don't
dream about being a good

2656
02:40:59,505 --> 02:41:02,958
wife, daughter, mother,
or daughter-in-law?

2657
02:41:03,029 --> 02:41:04,787
You talk about society.

2658
02:41:04,982 --> 02:41:10,966
Our life is to fulfill the
desires and lust of people.

2659
02:41:11,107 --> 02:41:14,060
Many people act like good ones.

2660
02:41:14,373 --> 02:41:17,505
They take off their masks and come to us.

2661
02:41:17,607 --> 02:41:20,295
Their speeches are great in meetings.

2662
02:41:21,732 --> 02:41:25,592
Tell me one thing if you are someone
who can judge right and wrong.

2663
02:41:25,787 --> 02:41:26,717
What is the time?

2664
02:41:27,529 --> 02:41:28,318
3:20.

2665
02:41:29,185 --> 02:41:30,318
Is it right?

2666
02:41:30,951 --> 02:41:32,045
It is right.

2667
02:41:32,169 --> 02:41:32,833
Good.

2668
02:41:32,951 --> 02:41:35,982
This time might be right for you but
is wrong in other places of the world.

2669
02:41:36,068 --> 02:41:38,575
One thing isn’t wrong just
because you think it is wrong.

2670
02:41:38,654 --> 02:41:43,974
He did not get rid of Chitti and
gave her a gift by being her father.

2671
02:41:44,224 --> 02:41:45,826
He is the real man!

2672
02:41:45,865 --> 02:41:47,499
If you judge his kindness
of giving a great future

2673
02:41:47,523 --> 02:41:49,123
to Chitti instead of
letting her be an orphan…

2674
02:41:49,263 --> 02:41:53,201
If this is the reason why
Uma-Karthik’s wedding got canceled…

2675
02:41:53,904 --> 02:41:59,263
It shows how ignorant even
though you are highly educated.

2676
02:41:59,725 --> 02:42:02,357
We started a poll to decide
if Fani is right or wrong.

2677
02:42:02,412 --> 02:42:04,701
Select option A if he is right
Select option B if he is wrong.

2678
02:42:04,726 --> 02:42:06,303
Send an SMS to the
number shown in scrolling.

2679
02:42:08,451 --> 02:42:09,693
Boo!

2680
02:42:12,123 --> 02:42:13,537
Boo!

2681
02:42:15,818 --> 02:42:16,842
What is this, Chitti?

2682
02:42:17,389 --> 02:42:19,904
I prepared a lot but I
cannot remember anything.

2683
02:42:20,295 --> 02:42:22,115
I have no idea what I might talk.

2684
02:42:23,342 --> 02:42:26,068
Okay, Play with the phone
I will prepare.

2685
02:42:27,412 --> 02:42:30,248
Chitti! I will go to Uma’s father
You little brat!

2686
02:42:30,693 --> 02:42:32,404
Did you record everything
I spoke in the morning?

2687
02:42:32,576 --> 02:42:34,045
You are smart just like me.

2688
02:42:34,178 --> 02:42:36,154
Okay. I will listen to it and prepare.

2689
02:42:39,467 --> 02:42:41,279
Chitti! Uma’s father is here.

2690
02:42:41,803 --> 02:42:42,826
Her family is there.

2691
02:42:43,303 --> 02:42:45,138
Uma is standing far from us
She will come.

2692
02:42:45,162 --> 02:42:45,858
Don’t worry.

2693
02:42:46,053 --> 02:42:47,443
Let us talk to Uma’s father now.

2694
02:42:47,873 --> 02:42:48,537
Brother-in-law!

2695
02:42:50,170 --> 02:42:52,287
Whatever I did might be a
huge mistake according to you.

2696
02:42:53,139 --> 02:42:53,889
I agree.

2697
02:42:55,779 --> 02:42:57,553
According to you!
Underline!

2698
02:43:00,717 --> 02:43:02,584
I never felt bad about my life.

2699
02:43:04,553 --> 02:43:05,131
But,

2700
02:43:06,850 --> 02:43:09,998
Karthik said something last time.

2701
02:43:11,178 --> 02:43:16,358
Dad! I proudly say that you are the
reason for my happy and secure life.

2702
02:43:17,451 --> 02:43:18,818
But now,

2703
02:43:20,443 --> 02:43:22,670
you became my problem.

2704
02:43:27,529 --> 02:43:30,631
He said it for the first time
My heart broke.

2705
02:43:35,740 --> 02:43:37,459
He doesn’t know something.

2706
02:43:38,553 --> 02:43:42,412
He tried to hide the truth for my sake.

2707
02:43:42,858 --> 02:43:46,115
He forgot that he might
not live happily with a lie.

2708
02:43:49,217 --> 02:43:52,326
Brother-in-law! There
are no questions in my life.

2709
02:43:52,709 --> 02:43:54,436
All I have are two answers.

2710
02:43:55,092 --> 02:43:57,975
One is Karthik and the other is Chitti!

2711
02:44:01,498 --> 02:44:07,099
How can leave one after 25 years?

2712
02:44:13,225 --> 02:44:15,498
This is the biggest question of my life.

2713
02:44:16,772 --> 02:44:19,779
Brother-in-law! Whatever we do,
we do it for the sake of our kids.

2714
02:44:20,334 --> 02:44:22,467
You declined the wedding for Uma.

2715
02:44:22,529 --> 02:44:25,615
I decided to leave my house for them.

2716
02:44:29,631 --> 02:44:33,295
Because of my mistake
and your stubbornness,

2717
02:44:33,592 --> 02:44:35,287
Why should we trouble them?

2718
02:44:38,873 --> 02:44:39,701
Please.

2719
02:44:44,389 --> 02:44:44,881
Shucks!

2720
02:44:46,115 --> 02:44:47,404
Why am I crying?

2721
02:44:48,139 --> 02:44:49,631
Why am I crying, Chitti?

2722
02:44:50,115 --> 02:44:51,623
No… Be brave!

2723
02:44:52,420 --> 02:44:53,123
Be strong!

2724
02:44:53,334 --> 02:44:55,068
Let’s tell them
Let’s convince them.

2725
02:44:57,193 --> 02:44:59,490
His decision about Chitti is simply great.

2726
02:44:59,592 --> 02:45:01,881
No one would do what he has done.

2727
02:45:01,998 --> 02:45:04,490
I don’t think Mr. Fani is wrong.

2728
02:45:04,592 --> 02:45:06,826
He should think about society.

2729
02:45:06,865 --> 02:45:11,092
Canceling the wedding because of having
a baby at the age of 50 is not right.

2730
02:45:11,350 --> 02:45:13,693
Everything is news these days!

2731
02:45:13,764 --> 02:45:15,420
Karthik bro! Do not worry.

2732
02:45:15,529 --> 02:45:17,623
We shall find Fani uncle
What do you say?

2733
02:45:17,678 --> 02:45:19,443
He has feelings.

2734
02:45:19,647 --> 02:45:21,404
How can you link up desires based on age?

2735
02:45:22,990 --> 02:45:27,951
Dad! I proudly say that you are the
reason for my happy and secure life.

2736
02:45:28,153 --> 02:45:34,840
He tried to hide the truth for my sake.

2737
02:45:35,215 --> 02:45:39,223
He forgot that he might
not live happily with a lie.

2738
02:45:39,567 --> 02:45:42,707
Brother-in-law! There
are no questions in my life.

2739
02:45:42,895 --> 02:45:44,887
All I have are two answers.

2740
02:45:45,481 --> 02:45:48,223
One is Karthik and the other is Chitti!

2741
02:45:48,418 --> 02:45:52,199
How can leave one after 25 years?

2742
02:45:54,387 --> 02:45:58,105
Because of my mistake
and your stubbornness,

2743
02:45:58,379 --> 02:45:59,872
Why should we trouble them?

2744
02:46:00,621 --> 02:46:05,191
“Hail…Lord Rama is here”

2745
02:46:06,543 --> 02:46:11,230
“Hail…Lord Rama is here”

2746
02:46:11,285 --> 02:46:16,863
“Hail…Lord Rama is here”

2747
02:46:16,903 --> 02:46:18,215
Why is everyone like that?

2748
02:46:18,520 --> 02:46:20,372
Let’s tell them what we planned to say.

2749
02:46:20,512 --> 02:46:22,067
We came here to say that, didn't we?

2750
02:46:22,122 --> 02:46:24,098
“He acknowledged Seetha”

2751
02:46:24,153 --> 02:46:26,348
“He adored much”

2752
02:46:26,426 --> 02:46:29,309
“He acknowledged Seetha”

2753
02:46:29,379 --> 02:46:31,590
“He adored much”

2754
02:46:31,911 --> 02:46:34,465
“He never cares what others think”

2755
02:46:34,528 --> 02:46:37,035
“He keeps his promise”

2756
02:46:37,067 --> 02:46:39,582
“Hail Rama”

2757
02:46:44,457 --> 02:46:45,903
Brother is waiting there.

2758
02:46:46,598 --> 02:46:47,637
Ask him to come inside.

2759
02:46:50,536 --> 02:46:51,231
Uma.

2760
02:46:51,489 --> 02:46:53,004
Call Karthik and ask him to come.

2761
02:46:53,106 --> 02:46:54,309
He might be worried.

2762
02:46:59,395 --> 02:47:00,653
Brother-in-law! Please come.

2763
02:47:01,739 --> 02:47:02,942
Brother-in-law!

2764
02:47:03,247 --> 02:47:05,801
Karthik, Chitti, and I…
- Karthik…

2765
02:47:06,035 --> 02:47:07,973
Let’s call a priest and
find an auspicious time.

2766
02:47:08,004 --> 02:47:08,801
Come.

2767
02:47:09,832 --> 02:47:10,348
What?

2768
02:47:10,832 --> 02:47:11,957
Are you okay with it?

2769
02:47:12,215 --> 02:47:12,872
Okay.

2770
02:47:13,223 --> 02:47:13,911
Okay.

2771
02:47:14,293 --> 02:47:15,879
What sweet do you like?

2772
02:47:16,043 --> 02:47:17,762
My mother makes tasty laddoos.

2773
02:47:17,997 --> 02:47:18,926
Do you like them?

2774
02:47:19,356 --> 02:47:21,332
I like sweets.

2775
02:47:22,082 --> 02:47:23,426
Are you indeed okay with it?

2776
02:47:23,512 --> 02:47:24,278
Come.

2777
02:47:24,395 --> 02:47:25,348
Just come.

2778
02:47:52,879 --> 02:47:53,551
Hey, Tom!

2779
02:47:54,386 --> 02:47:55,777
What is this, Jerry?

2780
02:47:56,332 --> 02:47:58,957
They were prepared before I came
What should I do…?

2781
02:47:58,989 --> 02:48:03,176
“What should I do…?
What should I do? I am your dad”

2782
02:48:03,201 --> 02:48:07,090
“Things we like might fade away
But whatever comes your way is yours”

2783
02:48:07,473 --> 02:48:11,793
“What should I do…?
What should I do? I am your dad”

2784
02:48:11,903 --> 02:48:16,113
“The age is 60 and strength weakens”

2785
02:48:16,239 --> 02:48:20,379
"He had a baby with ease back then”

2786
02:48:20,621 --> 02:48:24,653
“He is not even 20 but nothing happened”

2787
02:48:24,964 --> 02:48:29,277
“But, a girl was flattered
and a baby showed up”

2788
02:48:29,356 --> 02:48:30,692
“What should I do?”

2789
02:48:30,809 --> 02:48:33,668
“Come on, everybody”

2790
02:48:33,700 --> 02:48:38,033
v

2791
02:48:38,088 --> 02:48:42,588
“What should I do…?
What should I do? I am your dad”
