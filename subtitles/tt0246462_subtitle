1
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:34,691
Let's go Saroja!

2
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:39,037
Prabhakar, am l dreaming or
is it true?

3
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,536
You're seeing the absolute
truth

4
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,208
l'm going, right now
l'm going

5
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:45,035
l'm taking my wife along
with me

6
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:47,546
By keeping my family in
this house

7
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:49,539
l don't want to deprive of her
worldly happiness

8
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:54,214
Only a wife can't be called
as a family, my son

9
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:56,546
ln this family, you've a
brother....

10
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,049
A dumb sister

11
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,356
And also your helpless mother

12
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,189
Mother is not helpless but
her son is...

13
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:09,193
Whose father lost everything in business
and gave the residual land

14
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:10,698
To you, not to his son
and died

15
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:11,866
Forget it!

16
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,701
Why are you routed here?
let's go

17
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,540
Can't you stay here even
for a day also

18
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:18,039
Fortune won't smile on us
in a day

19
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,704
Son, tomorrow is your father's
death anniversary

20
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,046
What should l do?

21
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:23,874
You've to do oblation

22
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:27,418
And give peace to your
father's soul

23
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,084
This is the duty of the
eldest son

24
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,257
l don't believe in these
religious rituals

25
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,594
That is your headache, l can't
tolerate this forever

26
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:37,258
Let's go, horse carriage
has come

27
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:39,096
Ramcharan, bring the luggage

28
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,109
You still routed here? come!

29
00:01:51,678 --> 00:02:03,249
The moment of separation
has come again

30
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:16,258
Before also this heart had cried
and then lost something, Oh God!

31
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:25,934
Bid adieu...Bid adieu...

32
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:28,505
Oh! great Lord Krishna...

33
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:39,841
Give me your glimpse, so that
the desire ends

34
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:33,233
l remember you day and night

35
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,577
l always chant your name

36
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:43,908
l find your name so sweet

37
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:33,622
Whenever the boat of life rocks

38
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:39,805
At such time, you'll become
a boatman

39
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:44,305
How far is the bank from
the mid river

40
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,783
Hey Murali, when did you come?

41
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,456
And where is Sudhakar?

42
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,963
l've sent him for worshipping

43
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,629
Worshipping? what type of worship?

44
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,696
Arey, my miser father

45
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:17,305
To collect the fake loan money from
Sudhakar's friend, Shankar

46
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,137
He has sent some well built
rowdies to his house

47
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,816
l've sent Sudhakar to beat the
hell out of them

48
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,484
Oh! God, we're already on bad terms
with your father, Murali

49
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,683
Why have you created
this new problem?

50
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,853
Gowri, give offering to God, Murali
take the offering and go

51
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,362
You think, is it your
birth right?

52
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,695
That you can come to any locality
and beat people

53
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,700
Listen, don't interfere

54
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:47,701
This is Mr. Magan's affair

55
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,532
You! Mr. Magan's supporter!

56
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,872
Shankar, pick up your box

57
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,711
These beggars are showing
their high handedness

58
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,542
ls there any law and order
prevailing here?

59
00:06:55,782 --> 00:07:00,048
We don't care for any law and order
we carry out the orders of our boss

60
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:06,183
Come! we'll deal with your loyalty
in the police station...

61
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,518
We'll not go to police station!

62
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,522
Sudhakar, l'm going, you will follow
me isn't it?

63
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,696
Yes, l'll come

64
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,864
Move, driver!

65
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,865
Arey!.....driver stop

66
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,799
lt's a great wonder! Rowdies have been
given shelter in the village

67
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,533
When do we get such opportunity?

68
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,706
lf not, infront of the world

69
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,206
At least infront of God, we can talk
whole heartedly, isn't it?

70
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,048
Are you scared of my father?

71
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,253
Gowri, don't be scared of that
cunning cheat

72
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,753
l'm enough to set him right

73
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,265
Don't be scared, go and tell him that
mother is not at home

74
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,268
Arey, don't be scared
go and tell him

75
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,600
ls there anybody here in
this graveyard?

76
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,109
At least somebody speak

77
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,877
Go and tell your mother
Mr. Magan has come

78
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,043
Arey, why are you dancing?

79
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,753
Go inside and call your mother

80
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,750
Oh! Mr. Magan, please sit down

81
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,423
Did you hear about the misdeeds
of your son?

82
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,592
l heard, that's why, l went to
meet him at Shankar's house

83
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,427
But l couldn't find him there

84
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,429
How could you find him
when he wasn't there?

85
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,768
That cheat has become my enemy

86
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,770
And he has jailed my servants

87
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,608
Your servants?!

88
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,946
You should have been sent
to the jail, father!

89
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,276
Son of an idiot, Have you
come here again?

90
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,279
Hey, what's so great about
this dumb girl?

91
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,824
That, you are hovering around her
unfortunate fellow

92
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,991
Father! The snake dances by
hearing the pipe

93
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,497
But the buffalo gets enraged

94
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,659
What do you know about
love and romance?

95
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:57,994
You count only money

96
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,437
Your miserliness forced my
twin brother

97
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,266
To leave the house in his
childhood itself

98
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,107
One day l'll also run away

99
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,114
You won't run away
unfortunate fellow

100
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,116
But l'll kick you out

101
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:16,779
lf you won't listen to me, then l'll
make you suffer for a penny also

102
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,316
l'll dispossess you from my
wealth before l die

103
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,154
Did you see?

104
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:28,500
After getting entangled with your
daughter, my son is defying me

105
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:34,005
Why don't you dump this dumb
on some old man

106
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,174
And give up my son

107
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,674
You're lucky not to have
a daughter

108
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,674
But never talk ill about
others daughters

109
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,009
But be assured

110
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,888
That, from today, l'll take
care of my daughter

111
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:51,889
And you bother about your son

112
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:56,360
And what about your son who is
a pain in my neck?

113
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,731
How can that poor fellow be
a pain in your neck?

114
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,394
He's already neck deep
in your debts

115
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,234
l don't want to oppress anybody
for my debts

116
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,403
You pay my money, otherwise
vacate this house

117
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,735
And go somewhere else

118
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:15,072
Or else l'll auction your house

119
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:16,076
l warn you

120
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,790
Why did Magan come?
To demand his money?

121
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:30,955
What else? he's a creditor and
we're the debtors

122
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:36,127
When we can't repay it, we must
listen to the demands silently

123
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,965
Mother, don't worry, l've decided to
continue my studies

124
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,131
l'll go to town

125
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:43,967
What...?

126
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,803
Why? what's the problem?

127
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,812
Nothing, son!

128
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:53,310
After hearing the Separation &
Departure, my heart sinks

129
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,316
But mother, l'm going for studies

130
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:02,956
Alright son, but from where can l get
the money for this costly education

131
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,724
Think about that also

132
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:05,963
l'll manage about money

133
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:10,028
Do one thing....
Sell off the land

134
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,967
No mother! This is impossible

135
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,634
Selling of the land for my education

136
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,977
....And depriving from you
your livelihood

137
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,479
Then, How can you continue
your education?

138
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:27,480
l'll work, toil and complete
my education

139
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:28,815
....l'll repay the debts

140
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:36,455
l'll get my sister married to the man
she loves & send her off

141
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:41,030
....And after that, l'll serve you
all my life

142
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:48,374
lt's all God's miracles, you and
Prabhakar, both are my sons

143
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,370
Long live Prabhakar

144
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:58,213
We can't find another great friend
& selfless man in this town

145
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,542
There's no doubt in it

146
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:06,349
We'll be discussing with our future
generations about Prabhakar's parties

147
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,026
Come let's go...come let's go....

148
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,457
Did you hear the praise of
your husband?

149
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:41,420
After great difficulty, he has slept
...Please allow the child to sleep

150
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,430
All that glitters is not gold
That's your condition

151
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,598
What's the greatness in showing
false prestige?

152
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:56,600
Oh! My dear, whenever you get
angry...you're more beautiful....

153
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:05,711
Think it! showing false pomp
is neither easy nor waste

154
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:10,387
Didn't you see, how they went singing
peans about me and my pomp

155
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,757
l have mesmerised them so much that
wherever they go, they'll praise only me

156
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,757
...And walking on their praises
l'll reach...the top

157
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:23,768
Till which time you'll serve them
drinks with borrowed money

158
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,660
Till l get loans
-Don't you've to repay the loan?

159
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,770
Only he bothers, who wants to
repay the loans

160
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,777
Shall l ask you one thing?
-Ask two

161
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:38,681
Come on tell me, even after filling
your pockets with other's money

162
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:46,123
Why don't you get remembrance of your
hapless mother, brother & dumb sister?

163
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,653
Why've you talking about bad
at this bad time?

164
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,162
Come, let's go to sea shore

165
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:56,000
Come!

166
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,063
Come!

167
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,674
l feel very sad sending you
to town empty handed

168
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,537
Don't worry mother, l'll manage
somehow in the town

169
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:16,718
Has Vijay forgotten?

170
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:22,159
Mad girl, Brothers don't take from
sisters ....they only give

171
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:24,992
l'll get you a lot of things
from town

172
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,301
Mother!

173
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,498
Mother, are you crying?

174
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,678
When children separate & go
away from their mother

175
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:46,510
Only she knows about the
pain of separation

176
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,614
But you're going for education
so, l'll not cry

177
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:57,393
Take it, l don't have
anything else

178
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,231
You're going on a journey
take this jaggery sweet

179
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,164
Have these sweets and
remember me

180
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,663
l'll remember you even if
l don't eat sweets

181
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,001
Now, there's no one else to
look after mother

182
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:14,338
You've said it! my job is to
look after your mother isn't it?

183
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,844
Come, horse carriage has
come for you

184
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,740
Hey! Taxi Driver!.....
Taxi Driver

185
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,284
My taxi's number

186
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:56,783
Don't you feel shy?

187
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,785
You make customers wait
for 2 hours

188
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,548
And for such guys you'll
go like a flight

189
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,721
Shut up, Champa, he's not that
he's my friend

190
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,224
Now, You go away from here, otherwise
he'll know, we both are lovers

191
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:09,899
When its there, why should we
be afraid?

192
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,569
l'll shout at the top of my voice
that we both are lovers

193
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,897
...And this coward is hiding it

194
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,235
l'm very respectable person
Don't ruin it before my friend

195
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,739
A very respectable person has come
let me see, who's your friend?

196
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,571
....And my enemy

197
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,409
Look mister, this man has delayed
me by 2 hours

198
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:27,913
...And still he's refusing
to take me

199
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,052
ls it? what's it man?
what's the matter?

200
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:33,619
lt's a closed passenger!

201
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,292
lf it's a closed passenger
why have you left it open?

202
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:37,119
She unties herself!

203
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,455
Go....take her!
-Come

204
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:39,629
But, give me the keys & go!

205
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:43,129
Room keys! lf you go to the college
give the keys to the next house Aunty!

206
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:43,801
May be!

207
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,490
Again have you come in this
useless man's taxi?

208
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,623
Don't act smart Mr. Bhagat!
This is not a henchman's job?

209
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:15,459
lf l don't get your license cancelled
with my boss's help

210
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,793
l'll change my name!

211
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,966
Father, it's not that, today
taxi's are on strike, lsn't it?

212
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,805
l had to go out with madam

213
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,141
The local train didn't come!

214
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,641
He has brought me, risking his life
& you're talking about beating him

215
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,482
Did you hear? Eat your words

216
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,016
l shouldn't say you Taxi man
l'll...

217
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:39,982
Coming Boss!

218
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,195
Bhaskar was supposed to go to America

219
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:02,638
As per my advice, didn't you hit
the jackpot or not?

220
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:04,643
l did hit!

221
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,519
This is your share from Derby!

223
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,695

224
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:46,056
Father, l'm going to Association
from there l'm going to college

225
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,850
Bhaskar has been waiting for you
since a long time

226
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,421
Give him a grand send off!
-Why?

227
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,092
He's going to Mexico!

228
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:56,593
...To study new techniques

229
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:57,931
What's that?

230
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,601
Ask the right person, baby doll!

231
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:05,042
l'll tell you!...like
Matka(Gambling)

232
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,276
Come on, wish him and give
him a send off

233
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:22,923
What do you think of it?

234
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,763
My future wife has insulted me

235
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:29,765
lf not future wife, who else
will insult you?

236
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,941
Let her insult me!

237
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,436
l've to attend a very
important meeting

238
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,007
Sir!
-Drop him at Airport

239
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,273
Okay l'm going

240
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:52,152
Why've you coming after me?
-Come, l'll drop you at Airport!

241
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:55,483
Who are you to take
me to Airport?

242
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:59,830
Are you my future father-in-law?
ls your daughter, my future wife?

243
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,598
l shouldn't say it!-...Moustache!

244
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,174
Brilliant students &
future of the nation!

245
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:13,836
They were robbed in
broad day light!

246
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:21,083
Taking the entire Bhopal into their
lron fist, they broke the back of Business

247
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:22,785
They've ruined them

248
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:33,393
Do you know who has to bear
the result of this danger?

249
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:34,390
You've to!

250
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:40,067
When you come out of colleges
you'll not get food & jobs

251
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,732
You'll get kicks & despair

252
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:49,574
When Govt. policies are so
disastrous

253
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,080
lsn't it your duty to oppose it?

254
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,785
Yes... Yes

255
00:20:56,021 --> 00:21:01,857
lsn't it your duty to raise
your voice against injustice?

256
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,901
lf you say yes, then friends
rebel against it!

257
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,396
To register your protest
against injustices!

258
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:20,738
Go on strike in your colleges till the
Govt. changes it's policy of oppression

259
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:26,576
Long live Sir Dhanraj...
Long live

260
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:29,415
Brothers!

261
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:36,286
l request that l should be given a
chance to say my opinion

262
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:37,356
No!

263
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:41,632
Other than the chief guest, no one
is permitted to speak here

264
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:44,301
Why not? There's no ban
like that

265
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,299
Mr. Sudhakar can definitely talk

266
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:49,135
Come!

267
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:01,080
Honorable Principal & friends!

268
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:02,911
My question is this...

269
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,123
Getting into the trap of
selfish people

270
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:07,790
Quitting studies

271
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,288
...Going on strike

272
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,792
Can we achieve our wishes?

273
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:15,958
Brothers & sisters!

274
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,794
We are here for education!

275
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:24,308
Our parents, siblings, relatives

276
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,477
They're eagerly waiting for
that day

277
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,638
..When after our completion
of studies

278
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:34,478
We repay their favours with
the help of our education

279
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:36,311
Our society....

280
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:38,313
Our country...

281
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:41,191
To savour the fruit of
our knowledge...

282
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:44,357
lt is looking thirstily towards us!

283
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,025
That's why, friends!

284
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:49,533
Be alert and protect all
your 4 sides

285
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:54,702
And don't allow wolfs in sheep's
garb to hurt you

286
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,699
We've only one thing....
to study!

287
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,539
And other than studying we've
nothing to do

288
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:35,440
Long live Sudhakar...
Longlive Sudhakar

289
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,880
Hey! why've you pushing
that poor boy?

290
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,877
He has come for Education!

291
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:19,085
Only for education, nothing else

292
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:20,916
Come on pick up your books!

293
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:52,455
Scoundrels, dogs!
Let me see your strength!

294
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,665
Have you become so dare?

295
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,168
Will you behave like this, though you're
the students union secretary!

296
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,843
Have your hands become so long
to break others heads?

297
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,172
l'm calling the police now!

298
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:27,511
No sir! Don't call police
they're my colleagues

299
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:33,015
They're my colleagues, they were mislead
by someone and did this mistake

300
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:35,551
To bring them into the right path
they don't need punishment

301
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,389
They need to be pardoned!

302
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,730
They need Love & sympathies

303
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,731
Forgive them sir!

304
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,098
You must learn a lesson
from him

305
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,075
You?...come...come!

306
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:57,580
How's your health?

307
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:58,748
l'm fine

308
00:26:59,184 --> 00:26:59,582
Sit down!

309
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,010
l really regretted on
hearing it!

310
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:03,515
The truth is that..

311
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:08,054
This modern time isn't for good
straight forward idealists!

312
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,719
Today, world is very bad!

313
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:14,057
World was always good
even today, it's good

314
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,727
Sometimes people miss to use
the goodness properly!

315
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,734
Oh! Blood is coming out of
the wound!

316
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,735
Will you listen to my suggestion?

317
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:23,573
Come on tell!

318
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,737
l'll arrange for a nursing home
you stay there for few days

319
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,913
Thank you very much!

320
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,414
l don't drink that much!

321
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:33,408
What's that?

322
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,286
All the things that are helpful
for convalescing

323
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:41,951
Please forgive me!

324
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,453
l can't accept these!
-why?

325
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,288
Because, l can't pay you the
cost of these!

326
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:47,126
Cost?

327
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:50,130
Who's asking you the money for it?
Take it free of cost

328
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:52,469
Free of cost will become
a favours

329
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,133
How am l to carry that
much of weight?

330
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:55,968
You're being too formal!

331
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,300
lf l'm so formal, wouldn't
l've taken it!

332
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,406
You're strange! Champa take
back these things!

333
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,747
l've given you trouble
please forgive me

334
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,580
Listen! l'll not allow you to go
getting angry on me

335
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:09,911
Give Champa!

336
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,785
Wait! Take it

337
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,795
Yours as well as mine, both of us
wishes have been fulfilled

338
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,635
Buddy, what's this magic?

339
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,809
How did the Rolls Royce come
here with the Taxi?

340
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,803
Only a Taxi man knows about
that Taxi woman

341
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,976
Rolls had come to enquire
about my health

342
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,979
Did she come to enquire
or to show off?

343
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:41,980
Do you think everyone will
be like you?

344
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:15,118
You?

345
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,016
How come you're here?

346
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,851
My car's broken down!

347
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,686
Come, l'll take you home

348
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:29,699
Move!

349
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:49,210
They're not here to eclipse

350
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,429
Today's weather is good, lsn't it?

351
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,268
What?!....weather?!

352
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,433
Tell me, where do you
want to go?

353
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,270
Wherever you wish to
take me

354
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:15,946
Look Padma! l'm not well versed
with these routes!

355
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:17,446
...l may get lost!

356
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:20,116
You're a very dry man!

357
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:26,152
You don't know, what dreams
l've dreamt for you?

358
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:28,654
What l've thought about you?

359
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:31,661
l want to take you to
greater heights

360
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:32,324
What?!

361
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,157
That day, l had come to enquire
about your health

362
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,159
...And you hurt my feelings!

363
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:40,162
l couldn't sleep all that night
in anger

364
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:44,337
Please forgive me, it wasn't my
intention to hurt you

365
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,177
Please wait! let me see
what is your intention?

366
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:52,841
Pull out a card!

367
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:58,217
Pull out!

368
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,668
At least tell me now, where am
l to drop you?

369
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:14,170
Who are you to drop me?

370
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,168
Who wishes, is it Queen or slave?

371
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:19,835
Then, this slave is at your
service, my Queen!

372
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,170
Come on tell me, where am
l to take you?

373
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:11,220
You're sweating profusely, okay
pull into the right gate

374
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:33,074
Wait buddy!

375
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,952
You're fine, lsn't it? Have you met
with any accident?

376
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,295
Did you run on someone
with your Taxi?

377
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,622
No...buddy....no!

378
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,297
Thank God.... thank god!

379
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,792
Any earnings for today?

380
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:52,294
Not a single pie!
let me sleep...Go!

381
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:53,629
Go...let me sleep?!

382
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,635
That's why, l was telling you, running
a Taxi is not your cup of Tea

383
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:57,636
...Just concentrate on studies

384
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,241
Boy, this is a man's job!

385
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,571
ls running a Taxi everyone's job?

386
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,678
l'll run a Taxi, spoiled today's
earnings

387
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:38,137
What a mad lover l'm
that l loved you

388
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:47,518
l lit the fire and you
poured water on the fire

389
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:58,366
My lover, you didn't realise
the importance of my love

390
00:34:48,820 --> 00:35:03,360
ln the morning, l took the mirror
& was about to put a dot!

391
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:10,537
l found the colour of my eyes red
since l didn't sleep last night

392
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:21,375
The sweet night becoming a female
serpent in your memory stung me

393
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:27,779
How far will you go from me?
...l'm your shadow!

394
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:34,488
Come let's both meet together
the mating season has arrived

395
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:42,492
This wretched life is
100 years old....

396
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:45,998
But the youth stays only
for few years

397
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,676
Why did you fall from bed
early in the morning?

398
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,012
Were you fighting with someone
in the dream?

399
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:37,011
ls your friend at home?

400
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:41,221
What's the new trouble to my friend
so early in the morning?

401
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:46,054
Take this Rs: 50,madam had
sent for you

402
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:47,730
Rs: 50?! why?

403
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:48,556
Taxi fare!

404
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:49,728
Taxi fare!

405
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:53,565
You were saying there was no
earnings last night!

406
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:56,898
From where did this Rs.50
co-passenger appear suddenly?

407
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:01,673
Return it back, go!

408
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:05,006
Oh! why should it be returned?
passenger may get angry

409
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,510
Madam had called you by 4 pm
to Hotel Swarg!

410
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,348
Tell her that l can't come

411
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,056
Her heart will break
if you don't ...

412
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,729
This breaks won't be good!

413
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,563
You inform your madam that Shankar
will bring him there in his Taxi

414
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,061
Simpleton!

415
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,736
Private Talk!

416
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:43,576
Mr. Prabhakar....Mr. Prabhakar!
where are you Mr. Prabhakar?

417
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:45,246

418
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:47,957
How come everyone have
come together?

419
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,619
They're here to eclipse you!

420
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:52,624
Your creditors!

421
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:55,457
Oh! listen...listen...Tell them
that l'm not at home

422
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,463
l'm fed up with lying everyday!

423
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,465
Then send a word through Ramu!

424
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:01,569
Ramu has gone to drop
Krishna at school

425
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,073
Has Ramu gone to drop Krishna
at school?

426
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,902
Alright, l'll manage it myself!

427
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:08,069
He's not replying

428
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:10,746
Why will he not answer us?
call him loudly

429
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:18,080
Oh! mister! come out!
guests have come

430
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,414
Hey Mr. Prabhakar!

431
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,954
What's this everyone have
come together?

432
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,455
Has any new problem
cropped up?

433
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,129
How's your Business going sir?

434
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,298
The nightingales are cooing on
the interest!

435
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,295
...And the owls are howling on
the produce

436
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,627
Those who take money are never
paying back

437
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,462
My shop has become empty
it's up for rental

438
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,640
Please arrange some money
for all of us

439
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,969
Oh! don't make noise!

440
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,974
Let me hear one after
the other

441
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,644
Sir, Have you brought your bill?

442
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,477
Sir, l've been carrying the bill
with me for many days

443
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,311
Come...come in

444
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:54,023
Please sit here, Ramu, serve Tea
for the guest

445
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:59,529
Oh! come & sit here!
-l'll sit man, sit

446
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:04,867
l think there's no one more foolish
than you in this world

447
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,032
Will anyone do business
with this brain?

448
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:11,037
lf you want to do something...you
must've done it intelligently & cleverly

449
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:13,209
What?...what did l do?

450
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:15,708
lt's a common discussion in
Govt. circles

451
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:18,710
That you've emptied your shop and
filled up your Godown

452
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,887
Oh! God! l'm dead! l did this
by night

453
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:25,417
What am l to do now?

454
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:28,917
You do foolishly and then put
me into a fix

455
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:32,587
l'm worried, how am l going
to convince inspector?

456
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:38,594
Mr. Prabhu, you're Collector's secretary
everyone dances to your tunes

457
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:41,100
lf you make him understand, why will
he not understand?

458
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:45,104
inspector can't hear & understand
he can only see!

459
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,115
Take it! show him this!

460
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:55,785
Now, my life is in your hands
remember that

461
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,154
Bye-bye

462
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:02,421
...Please take your bill amount

463
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,424
Oh! Sir, keep it with you
what will l do with money?

464
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,602
Have you got back your
money sir?

465
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:20,435
Yes!

466
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:22,437
Sit down, have Tea...
have Tea

467
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,274
You had given 200 metres of
cloth isn't it?

468
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:26,278
Yes sir,200!

469
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:29,111
l had presented it to Collector

470
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:31,946
He had asked, where did l get this
Japanese material?

471
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,817
l gave your name and he has
put ClD's to enquire

472
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,987
l had only asked money for
the cloth

473
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,494
Why do you want to take
my life for it?

474
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:46,829
Take this Rs: 500 and save me
from this trouble

475
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,502
l'll try! Go!

476
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:05,321
What a great way of doing justice
in this modern times?

477
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:08,988
Whenever he asked for the best brands
l had supplied

478
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:12,491
When it comes to payment
it's Chandulal first

479
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,163
Let Mohanlal die waiting

480
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:17,663
Don't worry! he'll call
you also

481
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,496
Don't know, lf anything will remain
till my turn comes

482
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:24,170
He has plenty of money, isn't it
-plenty!...plenty...

483
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:33,678
Mr. Mohan...-yes sir!

484
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:44,054
Why do youngsters always insist on
Mohan's soda & dance on drinking it?

485
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:47,897
There's a talk going around police
who's this Mohan soda water man?

486
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,893
l'm dead! Now what will
happen to me?

487
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:53,399
What will happen? you'll go to jail
-Jail?!

488
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:57,737
Somehow get the police off
my back this time

489
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:06,182
My eclipse has achieved salvation
and brought hymns to my pocket

490
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,509
Bloody idiots!

491
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:09,013
Should you've done this?

492
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:10,181
Why not?

493
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,885
Where's a better way to get out
of poverty than this?

494
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:17,560
ln this socialist world, how can we
wipe the differences between Rich & Poor?

495
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:22,224
Take this and buy a good saree for
you and good dress for Krishna

496
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,898
l'll never buy anything from the money
earned by wrong means

497
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:27,228
Buy drinks for your friends!

498
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:32,568
My dear, whenever you get angry
you look more beautiful

499
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:39,415
l've tried to make you understand
in different ways

500
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,045
...That you're committing a
mistake

501
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:43,110
...l'm a poor man!

502
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:47,655
Your photo won't suit the poverty
stricken background of my family

503
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:53,553
This difference between Rich & Poor
can be wiped out somehow in Love

504
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:54,229
And mother?

505
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:00,500
lt isn't a decision taken in haste
but a decision taken over a long period

506
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,372
l've seen you from every angle

507
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:07,638
Like a cheater, you never hid
your poverty from me

508
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,812
You never took any favour from
me in difficulty

509
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:15,743
Your heart is filled with
love for your mother

510
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,352
...l know that

511
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:22,517
One who loves a mother so much
how much will he love his wife?

512
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:26,222
l always wanted such a
loving heart only

513
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:27,895
...And l've found it

514
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,260
l haven't done wrong in
selecting you

515
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:33,235
You?

516
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:36,200
You here?

517
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:39,803
You may not have forgotten him

518
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,078
But l'll introduce him to
you formally

519
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:44,979
He was my friend till yesterday

520
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:48,446
What?.....what did you say?

521
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:50,717
l've told you, isn't it?
How do you want me to tell?

522
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,952
l thought that Bhaskar was joking

523
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:55,288
Why did you come here?

524
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:59,656
l didn't come, l was called

525
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,597
You're roaming around with
a fiery tongue

526
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,959
Aren't you ashamed to come into
my house and setting it on fire?

527
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:07,863
Father, mind your language
l'm going to marry him

528
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:11,633
Are you so courageous to talk about
your marriage?

529
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,309
Why should l be courageous to talk
about my marriage with my father?

530
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,945
You're foolish, young & innocent

531
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:18,843
Come with me

532
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,181
The house into which you tried
to barge in

533
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:26,821
Have you seen its pomp & splendour?

534
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:30,458
Can you make a guess, how richly
l've brought up my daughter?

535
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:33,386
l've made her to swing in
a silver cradle

536
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,198
l've made her sleep on
velvet beds

537
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:36,990
Took her around in cars
in the size of a ship

538
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,895
Can you offer her all
these comforts?

539
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,471
Till now, l've never took into
account of giving & taking

540
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,601
lf l've to give really anything

541
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:48,938
l've an invaluable thing which is much
better than your Museum like home

542
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:50,903
To which you may be ignorant

543
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,117
l'm poor

544
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:57,117
Our perceptions are totally
different

545
00:45:57,621 --> 00:45:59,589
l've understood your perception

546
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,887
To get rid of your poverty, you trapped
my daughter in your love net

547
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:06,060
You want to usurp my property!

548
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:09,355
lf it's black mail, you could've
told me that straight

549
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,296
Take this price for your love and
go away from here

550
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:14,864
You're mistaken

551
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:18,706
l didn't trap your daughter into
the net of Love

552
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:23,202
And l'm not that mother's son, who'll
trade his love for few coins

553
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:26,978
Keep it with you! lt'll help you
in showing off

554
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:34,081
l never knew that you're such
a miserable man

555
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:36,785
You can get nobleness from
noblemen, free of cost

556
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:43,023
Stop him or else, l'll also
go away

557
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:44,359
Let me see, how you'll go

558
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:54,037
Child, even if father is wrong
we must agree to him

559
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:56,846
What are you blabbering?
Lock her up in the room

560
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:09,492
l shouldn't say, but you brought her up
so lovingly & now behaving so harshly

561
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,825
This locking up is not good

562
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:15,163
All that Rights, only you know

563
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:16,889
But that boy is much better
than you

564
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:17,759
Yes, he's poor

565
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:20,003
ldiot, what's the connection between
poverty & good

566
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:21,226
Go....and see there

567
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:23,238
Ensure that, she doesn't go out

568
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:28,871
This moustached man can't
control that cat

569
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,741
You hear me....
l'll go to her room

570
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,212
.....l'll lock the room and
lose the key

571
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:40,388
Then, no one can come in from outside
and no one can go out from inside

572
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:47,822
Look, there! He is there

573
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:54,997
Hey boy Murali! l am asking
you to stop

574
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:05,615
Listen to me, stop

575
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,778
You can't escape, l'm asking
you to stop

576
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,659
We've caught them at last!

577
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,163
You take that wayward son home
you leave her!

578
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,165
l'll come back after performing her
obsequies! you come with me!

579
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,336
Come...come with me

580
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:35,845
Come, you wretched woman. come
come...come

581
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,841
Here, control your wretched
daughter!

582
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:42,343
Did you send her to Patwari's
marriage?

583
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,348
Or to elope with my son?

584
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:46,013
But, l'll not tolerate any more

585
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:49,691
l'm warning you, today, you leave
this village with this dumb girl

586
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:53,062
Otherwise, l'll put your house
to auction

587
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:53,729
Understood?

588
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:55,060
Come!

589
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:18,679
Mother, if you lose heart in the
face of a problem?

590
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,680
Then, who'll inspire us to
continue to live?

591
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:24,886
Get up, prepare & eat food

592
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:30,229
l'm neither qualified to eat
nor to face the society

593
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:36,071
Before leaving the house bring a
little poison, Ramcharan

594
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,573
So that, l'll take it & die

595
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,244
Dead body will be taken
out by Murali's father

596
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:44,746
Why such inauspicious talk?

597
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,078
You should not utter bad words

598
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:49,952
l'll get food from my house

599
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:56,455
Get me little poison before going

600
00:49:57,127 --> 00:50:01,291
l'll have and die, Murali's father
will take out my body

601
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:10,139
Gowri, come & eat with your mother

602
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:15,974
Mother, l've brought food, eat it

603
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:28,857
Where has she gone?
Nobody is here

604
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,025
What's all this, Oh Lord!
lt's a calamity!

605
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,698
Gowri is not inside, her ornaments
are left behind

606
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:43,202
What's this! Go & search my
daughter, Ramcharan

607
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,204
What has happened to my daughter....?

608
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:28,545
What sort of departure from
the house is this?

609
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:41,254
Before also this heart had cried
& then lost something, Oh!God!

610
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:51,605
Departure, Departure...

611
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:13,426
lf Sudhakar asks, where is
my sister?

612
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:16,090
What'll l tell him?

613
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,154
l won't give....
l won't give....

614
00:52:47,397 --> 00:52:49,331
These guavas are only for Gowri

615
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:50,995
l'll give it to Gowri only

616
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:53,335
You mad fellow, Gowri
has drowned

617
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:57,840
Your father has drowned, your
grandfather has drowned

618
00:53:11,555 --> 00:53:14,115
Aye Murali! Useless fellow

619
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:18,160
Arey children, have you
seen my Murali?

620
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:20,158
He has gone that side
in search of Gowri

621
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:22,160
Has he gone to die with Gowri?

622
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:25,993
How did you get hurt?

623
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:27,835
l fell down from the tree

624
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:30,665
l had gone to pluck the
guavas for Gowri

625
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:32,507
Gowri likes Guavas

626
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:34,672
Where is she? call her!

627
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:40,011
How to call her Murali
My voice can't reach there

628
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:43,347
She shouldn't have gone
that far alone

629
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:46,718
lt's a tradition to go
there alone

630
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:49,216
Have you packed food for her?

631
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:54,055
Ever since Gowri has gone
l haven't eaten

632
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:56,724
Mother, l'm hungry

633
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:58,566
Son, l'll get you food, just now!

634
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:00,231
Wait! l'll get you, just now

635
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:08,844
My innocent Gowri is unique...

636
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:23,554
lt's learnt that Taxi No.2222
is missing from the town

637
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:26,888
All the police stations and
check posts have been alerted

638
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:28,722
That's there....

639
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:30,395
You're responsible!

640
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,563
You've conspired to kidnap
my daughter

641
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:36,735
lf you're angry, abuse me
but don't question my loyalty

642
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,074
Okay, loyal person, tell me
where has she gone?

643
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:43,412
l shouldn't say, but imposing your
will on grown up daughter

644
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:44,238
Ends up this way

645
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:56,017
She has escaped? Oh!God!

646
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,118
She has left the house

647
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:00,955
Boss, elders say

648
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,626
Once the daughter leaves the house
she is gone forever

649
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:12,959
The bad luck has come

650
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:14,627
l shouldn't say

651
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:19,308
But fixing the alliance to this rogue
was a grave mistake

652
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:26,138
Where is my bride?... my bride....

653
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:29,082
Bhaskar, now, you go away from here

654
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:33,683
Without my would-be wife?

655
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:38,856
Without her would-be husband?!

656
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:42,523
lt's correct! Hearing about the alliance
with such a person

657
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:44,194
Whose daughter won't run away?

658
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:50,201
lf she was married to me

659
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:52,868
She wouldn't have dared to
run away

660
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:54,701
l shouldn't say....

661
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:57,044
Put your moustache down

662
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,523
You're a big fool you shouldn't
have done that

663
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,191
What do you mean?
What did l do?

664
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:11,189
You created the problem
and ran away

665
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:14,192
Shut up! ldiot, you don't understand
anything

666
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:17,525
Mother, l've told everything
about this secretive fellow

667
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:18,859
Don't listen to him at all

668
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,370
l've heard & understood
everything

669
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:26,037
l feel, if along with the
college education

670
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:29,712
He has learnt a bit of Love also
then why it should be hidden?

671
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,038
Hide!

672
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:32,609
Here take it
-l haven't hidden but....

673
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,374
Enough...enough...
l've understood

674
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:37,210
Child, just tell me one thing

675
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:42,252
Are you under the impression that
Sudhakar is a rich person like you?

676
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:46,586
No! He has told me everything clearly
-But, Mother...

677
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:51,597
Sudhakar, the respect of daughters is
delicate like mimosa plant

678
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,432
After leaving father's house

679
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:58,265
When the girl enters someone
else's house

680
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:00,373
She belongs to him

681
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:03,545
Shankar, call the priest

682
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:07,716
And bring Ramcharan with you

683
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:11,987
What did you say?
Marriage is over!

684
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:15,253
Yes sir! Girl is a major
we can't interfere in this

685
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,421
You better congratulate them

686
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,772
Now, you may talk in English or
Persian, it means the same

687
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:38,113
What you get, it's yours and what you
don't get, it's not yours

688
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:11,276
lt's a matter of luck, without much
efforts, the grape fell into my mouth

689
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:13,778
lf it hadn't, then would you've
called it sour

690
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:15,984
lt didn't appear sour when it
was on the branch

691
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,821
Then why didn't you reach
and pluck it?

692
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,155
lt was high

693
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:24,818
l was afraid, that it may
fall in dust

694
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:28,994
All lies, to grab the grape they
were all your maneuvers

695
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:30,831
You're very cunning

696
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:36,505
Whatever l am, l'm infront of
you, madam Padma

697
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,504
Listen mister-yes

698
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:45,510
One day l told you that we'll
not indulge in formalities

699
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:48,883
From today onwards

700
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:51,552
Stoop down to lowest level
of informality

701
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:57,222
That's after today, there are still
few hurdles left

702
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:00,057
Are they very strong?

703
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:01,559
Shall l remove them?

704
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:03,894
Leave me

705
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:06,727
By leaving you, will the hurdles
be removed?

706
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:09,570
You're very out spoken

707
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:16,240
Turn your face that side
-why?

708
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:17,575
l will change my dress

709
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:19,243
What can l see after turning
my face?

710
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:23,284
lf you don't want to turn, then
switch off the lights

711
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:23,746
Why?

712
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,578
Light hurts the eyes

713
01:00:26,189 --> 01:00:27,622
Then close the eyes & change

714
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:31,451
Don't switch off

715
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:55,312
You are the same person

716
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:59,980
Who didn't feel shy by being
informal for the whole night

717
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:17,362
Everyone look, everyone look

718
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:33,205
He is my lover who salutes me
-salutes

719
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:42,754
l'm his queen & he is
my jack(slave)

720
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:55,429
l'm her lover, l salute her

721
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:04,709
She is my Queen, l'm her jack(slave)

722
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:30,097
He is my moon
l'm his moon beam

723
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:32,603
l'm the fragrance, he is
the flower

724
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:39,944
ln my remembrance

725
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:47,155
He forgot everything

726
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,320
What's your name?

727
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:52,493
l don't remember

728
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:54,821
What is your village?

729
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:57,498
l forgot

730
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:58,832
Who am l?

731
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:01,428
My beloved

732
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:03,934
How do l look?

733
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:07,275
Very beautiful

734
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:12,781
l'm his fairy, he is my
beautiful flower

735
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:55,023
They make such a wonderful
couple

736
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:12,164
Look, l'll show you the game
of my love, you'll sing

737
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,842
Yes, l'll sing

738
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:17,011
You'll dance

739
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,847
Yes, l'll dance

740
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:37,057
Hey, how to praise you, l don't
have words for it

741
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:46,737
Even fairies don't have
such style

742
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:52,077
l'll spend day & night in
your service

743
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:56,918
Whenever l call a name
lt'll be only yours

744
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:02,219
You make me feel happy like
this all the time

745
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:46,297
We've seen lakhs of lovers, they
are one among lakhs

746
01:06:54,710 --> 01:07:03,584
Friend, stay far away
don't touch him

747
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:08,756
Come, come,come,come
come closer

748
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:13,962
Come on, go,go.....
go far away

749
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,464
He is tall

750
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,963
So what?

751
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:20,467
What does he do?

752
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:22,963
He's loyal to me

753
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:25,468
Where does he stay?

754
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,476
inside my heart

755
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:34,145
My daddy has bequeathed
everything to him

756
01:07:45,928 --> 01:07:47,691
Bye...bye...

757
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,871
Oh God!....Oh God!....
Oh God!....

758
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,535
My God! you want to open
a shop!

759
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,205
They are not for the shop, these
are all necessary things

760
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:35,876
lf these are necessary things

761
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:40,044
Then salt, oil, spices, wheat, rice
are unnecessary things

762
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:42,542
You can't bath with salt & oil

763
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:44,752
And tooth paste can't be made
out of rice & wheat

764
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:47,755
Correct, but life depends on them

765
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:51,425
Then, we'll have to live only
on wheat & rice

766
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:56,260
You'll have to solve this problem

767
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:59,767
You've married a man with
meager income

768
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:01,865
You'll have to change your style

769
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:04,698
lf you start helping mother
in her chores

770
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:08,368
Then unnecessary needs will reduce
automatically, come

771
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:17,882
Mother, let her also help now
you need rest

772
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:33,767
Mother!!

773
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:42,440
Whenever l call my name
lt'll be only yours

774
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:14,842
Mother!!

775
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:19,179
l got the salary, mother

776
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:24,014
Bravo, my earning son

777
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:27,889
What was the hurry to give it
to me in the kitchen?

778
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:32,386
Mother, you look very tired
what is the matter?

779
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:34,395
lt's old age, son

780
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:46,737
You are resting here!

781
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:49,911
Why shouldn't l take rest?

782
01:10:50,312 --> 01:10:51,904
When mother works in the old age

783
01:10:52,314 --> 01:10:54,009
lt is unjust for the daughter-in-law
to take rest

784
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:57,951
You've started fighting
as soon as you've come

785
01:10:58,854 --> 01:11:00,719
Fighting! Am l fighting?

786
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:03,557
You got the salary

787
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:05,885
Yes, l've given it to mother...
why?

788
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:09,726
lt means, you've not brought my things
this time also

789
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:12,066
Padma, how to make you
understand...?

790
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:14,565
That my income can't provide
those things

791
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:18,735
Then why don't you come to
daddy's place?

792
01:11:19,808 --> 01:11:20,900
Champa's letter has also come

793
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:23,407
Daddy will be very happy to
see us

794
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:26,913
Why, what happened?

795
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:31,452
For our comforts, l'll not
leave my mother alone

796
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:32,619
At least listen to me

797
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:34,120
Sudhakar, come here son!

798
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:09,090
Hey, l fall short of words
to praise you

799
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:18,463
Even fairies don't have
such a style

800
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:23,467
l spend day in & night out
in your service

801
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:27,198
Oh! Enough, leave it
it's tight

802
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:29,135
You don't look after your health...

803
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:31,974
Now it's alright

804
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:34,307
l'll put the bed also
-l'll do that

805
01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:40,354
Mother, protect yourself from cold
and water, otherwise, you'll fall sick

806
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:45,356
My health is not so delicate
you go, it's already late night

807
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:23,525
Here son, keep this money
for the journey

808
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:26,196
Ramu uncle, you keep this

809
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:29,702
This half is for me, the other half
is for the poor

810
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:32,206
Okay Mother, shall l make a move?

811
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:35,269
Be careful, son

812
01:13:36,445 --> 01:13:37,537
Salutations to Goddess Mother

813
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:50,253
What language is this
boy speaking?

814
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:53,920
The language that all mothers
want their sons to speak

815
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:57,758
Which you never bother to speak?

816
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:02,197
Krishna never goes anywhere
without taking mother's blessings

817
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,039
And his father doesn't remember
his mother ever

818
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:06,699
l don't know

819
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:11,041
Under influence of which sins and
blessings, children are born to people

820
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:17,209
Darling, you've never understood me

821
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:21,722
Lord Shiva doesn't keep his mother
but his wife on his lap

822
01:14:22,157 --> 01:14:23,249
l'm his devotee

823
01:14:23,492 --> 01:14:28,429
Lord Vishnu makes Goddess Laxmi to
press his feet for 24 hours

824
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:29,763
l'm his devotee

825
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:33,100
That's why language is not the one
which you've taught your son

826
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:36,437
l believe that wife is
the Goddess

827
01:14:37,172 --> 01:14:40,608
Wife is the Goddess
wife is the Goddess

828
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:43,440
...ls the Goddess, is the Goddess

829
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:58,153
Hey, what happened?

830
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:01,322
Why's this sudden vomit?

831
01:15:02,064 --> 01:15:03,429
Shall l call any doctor?

832
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,262
Don't trouble yourself

833
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,093
lf there is any pickle
please bring it

834
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,937
Pickle?.....Oh! God!

835
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:13,100
Oh! you're pregnant, dear

836
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:18,774
Hey, Sudhakar, if you get some raw
mangoes, bring them

837
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:21,115
You've cough and want
to eat raw mango?

838
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:24,114
Not for me, for your wife

839
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,153
Why does she need raw mangoes?

840
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:30,347
You are very innocent
she is pregnant

841
01:15:31,226 --> 01:15:32,488
You're going to become a father

842
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:35,830
You go inside, l'll get them
from somewhere

843
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:49,008
Mother has gone to bring
raw mangoes

844
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,844
Do you know, how happy mother is
to know this!

845
01:15:56,285 --> 01:15:56,717
And you?

846
01:15:57,619 --> 01:15:59,678
You can't imagine the magnitude
of my happiness

847
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:01,321
Really

848
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:06,819
Champa has sent another letter

849
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:08,053
What has she written?

850
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:09,826
She has written

851
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:11,164
That if you go there

852
01:16:11,466 --> 01:16:14,833
Dad is ready to give you car, money
Business and everything

853
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:17,496
What do you mean by it?

854
01:16:18,473 --> 01:16:19,337
lt means, you wish that
l become intern-son-in-law

855
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,008
.....And look after father-in-law's
business?

856
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,177
And leave my mother here to
fight for every meal

857
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:25,675
What your mother is to you
my sister is to me

858
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:28,343
l've already told you to
send money to her

859
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,243
What more she wants?

860
01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:33,220
ls a mother's gratitude repaid
with money?

861
01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:38,052
Do you want me to repay my fate
with your given poverty?

862
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:41,387
Listen properly, l'm myself going
to be a mother soon

863
01:16:42,297 --> 01:16:44,561
Neither l don't want to go through
difficulties at this time

864
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,226
Nor l don't want my child to be
born in poverty & deprivation

865
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:50,730
l'll go and you've to
come with me

866
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:53,399
Not only you've wishes
l too have

867
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:56,410
My mother is a poor woman, her son, me
l'm also poor

868
01:16:56,979 --> 01:17:01,916
l'm poor, so neither l'll go nor allow
you to give birth to my son in Riches

869
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,612
Let me die!

870
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:15,396
Better than dying a suffocated death
in poverty, it's better to die now

871
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:18,125
....Send my body to my father

872
01:17:18,867 --> 01:17:22,394
Go to your mother....
Go to your mother!

873
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:36,241
Mother!

874
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:47,360
Mother!

875
01:17:56,705 --> 01:17:57,137
Mother!

876
01:17:59,274 --> 01:17:59,638
Mother!

877
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:02,406
Mother!

878
01:18:03,311 --> 01:18:06,246
Mother! Mother! Are you a child
still drinking milk?

879
01:18:06,548 --> 01:18:07,913
Who's always with the mother?

880
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:09,740
Mother
-What's it?

881
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:11,241
What do you want from mother?

882
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:13,245
l've got my salary
-l want to give it to you

883
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:15,717
Did you find only mother
to give?

884
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:17,184
Why don't you give it to
your wife?

885
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:19,790
What are you saying mother? When you're
here, why will l give it to her?

886
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:21,791
lf l die, you'll give her isn't it?

887
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:23,388
Think that l'm dead

888
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:25,966
Managing your home now is
beyond my ability

889
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:27,460
lt's now a matter between
you & your wife

890
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:30,296
What's the matter, mother?

891
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:32,529
Did she have any argument
with you?

892
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:34,633
Why will l fight with her?

893
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:37,804
Am l a country girl to fight
with her?

894
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:42,312
l'm here to live with you, not
to fight with your mother

895
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:45,352
You're accusing me wildly

896
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:48,147
l'm already crying on
my bad fate

897
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:51,856
Why do you want to argue
with her for me?

898
01:18:54,429 --> 01:18:57,694
Son, don't spread thorns in your path
of happiness for me

899
01:18:59,768 --> 01:19:04,796
Your father's home is small
your mother's saree is small

900
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:11,645
Neither can l cover you
nor cover her head?

901
01:19:13,615 --> 01:19:16,482
You go to your father-in-law's
house with your wife

902
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:22,018
Mother, what are you saying?
-Son, l'm saying it right

903
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:26,859
lt's good for you to leave me to
my fate like Prabhakar

904
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:30,023
ls it good for a son to leave
a mother for a wife?

905
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:37,205
You gave birth to me
you brought me up

906
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:40,764
Mother, it's my duty to serve
you in your old age

907
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:45,379
Even keeping a wife happy is also
your duty, isn't it?

908
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:49,212
First, it's mother, then only wife

909
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:55,920
A mother is a guest for few days only
you've to spend a life with wife

910
01:19:57,492 --> 01:19:59,653
Happiness of a guest for few days
is the biggest happiness for me

911
01:20:01,496 --> 01:20:03,327
Don't make this world at large
to wag it's tail

912
01:20:03,832 --> 01:20:07,928
Saying that bringing a Rich girl
son & mother have tortured her

913
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:14,934
l don't like this bad name that an old
lady couldn't stand a rich girl

914
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:16,667
She's a Rich man's daughter...

915
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:19,780
....She can't adjust with a
poor mother-in-law

916
01:20:21,082 --> 01:20:21,605
....You take her

917
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:23,609
Mother, lt'll never happen

918
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:27,279
That Rich man's daughter came here after
knowing all about my poverty

919
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:29,550
She must endure all this

920
01:20:29,891 --> 01:20:32,485
l'll never go with a wife leaving
a mother alone

921
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:36,919
Do you want to spoil my
peaceful old age?

922
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:40,000
Do you want to kill your mother
before her death?

923
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:40,667
Mother!

924
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:45,832
lf you want me to spend my
remaining days peacefully

925
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:47,837
....Go away with her

926
01:20:49,744 --> 01:20:50,176
Mother!

927
01:20:58,186 --> 01:21:00,051
My child don't cry...
don't cry

928
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:03,319
l got your letter
No need to worry anymore

929
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:05,025
Look, l've come to take
you with me

930
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:16,830
Leave this sorrowful life
come with me

931
01:21:17,572 --> 01:21:18,504
...l've come to invite you

932
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:22,836
You've already taken my daughter
but didn't take dowry

933
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:26,510
Now, l'm ready to give Wealth, Business
everything as dowry to you

934
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:32,178
What are you thinking now?
your mother had permitted you to go

935
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:35,216
My father has come to get rid of
your problems

936
01:21:35,523 --> 01:21:36,455
What more do you expect?

937
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:41,722
Come....come...l'll wait for you
outside, come child

938
01:21:51,973 --> 01:21:53,235
Okay Mother, l'm going

939
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:55,901
Go, my son!

940
01:21:58,313 --> 01:22:01,407
l know, how much of difficulty you've
undergone to ask me to go

941
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:03,842
l promise you....

942
01:22:04,185 --> 01:22:06,676
The one who brought this wall of
thorns between a mother & a son

943
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:10,390
l'll come back only after teaching her
a lesson about mother's greatness

944
01:22:10,959 --> 01:22:12,790
Listen me also Sudhakar

945
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:16,563
lf you come back leaving that would be
mother for this mother

946
01:22:17,132 --> 01:22:18,463
...You'll not find this
mother alive

947
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:59,634
The time for the send off
has arrived

948
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:11,450
Earlier also this heart cried
and then lost something, My Lord

949
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:56,029
Why do you always remember
poverty stricken life past?

950
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:03,963
A poor woman's son will be Rich
A rich woman's husband will be poor

951
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,632
How can this be forgotten?

952
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:08,971
Now, you're no more poor

953
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:13,306
You're a modern time's, Modern
Society's cultured wife's

954
01:24:13,615 --> 01:24:15,139
Rich & Romantic husband

955
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:17,642
Take these documents

956
01:24:19,087 --> 01:24:21,146
From today, you're the proud owner
of this palatial bungalow

957
01:24:22,424 --> 01:24:24,892
l've arranged a cotton mill also
to be transferred to your name

958
01:24:28,997 --> 01:24:30,862
Why've you staring at
me like that?

959
01:24:31,766 --> 01:24:34,701
Not you, l'm looking at
your madness

960
01:24:35,937 --> 01:24:41,534
Yes...l'm mad! you've made me mad

961
01:24:41,943 --> 01:24:44,070
l'm his Queen and
he's my slave

962
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:48,043
...Look....look!

963
01:24:49,484 --> 01:24:52,885
Shoes....Clothes..Watches, these
are bills worth thousands

964
01:24:53,154 --> 01:24:54,086
Have you brought it
by mistake?

965
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:55,880
Sir, these are son-in-law's bills
-So many?

966
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:56,589
Yes....

967
01:24:57,992 --> 01:24:58,424
You go....

968
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:04,356
Did you see, when he's getting
every thing free of cost-

969
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:06,362
Son-in-law, immediately got down
to foppishness

970
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:09,194
Boss....

971
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:14,532
Listen...please listen to me
Mr. l'm telling you...

972
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:18,208
Telling it to me?
-Yes, to you

973
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:29,382
That's okay, but why did you spend 1000's
of rupees on Shoes, Clothes etc

974
01:25:29,657 --> 01:25:31,591
lt'll be much better, if you ask
your daughter about this

975
01:25:31,826 --> 01:25:35,091
What should l ask her, that poor
girl is mesmerised in your magic

976
01:25:35,497 --> 01:25:36,589
Where're you going?

977
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:38,597
l'm going to the Mill Office

978
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,934
Be careful, may be you'll
even ruin the mill

979
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:43,427
What did you say?
-Nothing

980
01:25:49,711 --> 01:25:50,109
Yes Boss....

981
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:53,278
Fathers bring servants for
their daughters-

982
01:25:54,349 --> 01:25:56,613
My daughter has brought a headache
for her father

983
01:25:57,552 --> 01:26:00,885
Boss, you should be totally different
from the world, lsn't it?

984
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:04,750
This is sir's office

985
01:26:06,094 --> 01:26:08,756
Probably, sir is feeling the pressure
of new responsibility?

986
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:16,103
To start with, this man is fully aware
of all the loop holes of this mill

987
01:26:16,337 --> 01:26:19,431
Sir, you transfer all your worries
on this worthless man-

988
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:21,266
And then you watch this
Bhatnagar's capability

989
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,112
Sir, don't think that l'm
blowing my own trumpet

990
01:26:25,346 --> 01:26:29,442
The share holders of this mill
may God, let their souls rest in peace

991
01:26:30,051 --> 01:26:32,485
Late Mr. Padmakar, very often
used to say-

992
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,780
That Bhatnagar, you're not
a strange man

993
01:26:36,057 --> 01:26:37,649
But you're a strange angel

994
01:26:39,093 --> 01:26:40,822
What name did you say?
-Mr.Padmakar

995
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:42,158
Where was he from?

996
01:26:42,397 --> 01:26:45,332
You probably may not know there's a
small town near Hasanpur

997
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:49,161
You must be having the record
of his share, lsn't it?

998
01:26:49,404 --> 01:26:51,668
Sir, every paper and every part
is very much here

999
01:26:51,906 --> 01:26:54,500
l would like to see
-With pleasure, l'll just bring it

1000
01:26:59,414 --> 01:27:00,938
Because of your father
being an illiterate-

1001
01:27:01,182 --> 01:27:04,447
Those clever people had cheated
your father in the business

1002
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:07,821
He gave up his life
in that sorrow

1003
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:09,656
Go son, go to school

1004
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:30,010
Mr.Bhatnagar, l myself want to see all
the work going on in this Mill

1005
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:30,836
Come with me

1006
01:27:41,789 --> 01:27:43,723
Why've sacks of grains stored
in the Godown of cotton?

1007
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:46,552
Sir, what should l say
it's an illegal business-

1008
01:27:46,794 --> 01:27:48,386
One can come to know, only
in the due course

1009
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:49,747
Sher Singh, l'm ruined
l'm destroyed

1010
01:28:50,191 --> 01:28:52,125
The police has raided the
wheat godowns

1011
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:53,452
Hey, l'm totally ruined....

1012
01:28:54,028 --> 01:28:56,121
Sher Singh, l'm totally ruined....

1013
01:28:58,766 --> 01:29:00,734
Where has so many envelopes
come from?

1014
01:29:02,036 --> 01:29:03,060
Whose letter is it?

1015
01:29:03,304 --> 01:29:06,398
Mother, it's Sudhakar
-Sudhakar's?

1016
01:29:09,477 --> 01:29:11,069
What has he written, read it

1017
01:29:12,313 --> 01:29:18,081
l'm sending you 30 envelopes
if you daily post me one letter-

1018
01:29:18,853 --> 01:29:22,914
l'll spend a month with peace
...your Sudhakar

1019
01:29:25,293 --> 01:29:27,625
Mother, one should be really lucky
to get such a son

1020
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:30,126
Ramcharan, l've got work

1021
01:29:31,966 --> 01:29:36,960
By writing one letter daily
l'll spend each and every day

1022
01:29:40,108 --> 01:29:43,134
l'm ruined.. l'm plundered
in broad day light

1023
01:29:43,544 --> 01:29:44,977
l'm ruined

1024
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:47,138
Over here, l fell down in the
eyes of catalyst

1025
01:29:47,548 --> 01:29:48,981
And over there, the communists
have looked into it

1026
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:53,654
lf l would've known, that the factory
made from my hard-earned money

1027
01:29:53,921 --> 01:29:55,354
My son-in-law, the messenger
of death

1028
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:57,353
Will blow it off by putting
an atom bomb

1029
01:29:57,592 --> 01:29:59,526
Then, l would've never ever agreed
to this ignorant girl

1030
01:30:00,094 --> 01:30:02,358
And transfer my entire business
to his name

1031
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:04,192
You did like this...

1032
01:30:13,107 --> 01:30:15,701
Just think, to become your
son-in-law

1033
01:30:15,977 --> 01:30:18,377
That communist was good or this
fortunist is good

1034
01:30:26,821 --> 01:30:29,255
lt'll be better, lf l get you
introduced to them

1035
01:30:29,657 --> 01:30:32,922
He is Mr.Bhatnagar, the Manager and
shareholder of Dharamdas Co-operative Mill

1036
01:30:36,364 --> 01:30:40,266
The one who used to stand at an arms
length with folded hands

1037
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:43,095
My ordinary servant is daring to
shake hands with me?

1038
01:30:43,337 --> 01:30:44,770
Sir, lt's all the glory of time

1039
01:30:45,173 --> 01:30:48,108
Today, the tied one's are free and
the bowed heads are up

1040
01:30:48,342 --> 01:30:49,104
Bhatnagar's of a gun

1041
01:30:49,677 --> 01:30:52,271
ls this the reward for my favour on
you for the last 30 years?

1042
01:30:52,513 --> 01:30:53,605
Mind your language

1043
01:30:54,015 --> 01:30:55,448
Now, Bhatnagar is not your
bloody servant...

1044
01:30:55,683 --> 01:30:56,615
But a share holder of this Mill

1045
01:30:58,553 --> 01:31:03,547
Now, meet him, he's Mr. Shankar Lal
secretary of worker's union

1046
01:31:03,991 --> 01:31:07,757
Son-in-law, of which loafer are you
talking about, he's a Taxi driver

1047
01:31:08,696 --> 01:31:10,926
Talk with respect...why is this
mouth lifted up so much?

1048
01:31:11,165 --> 01:31:12,564
Leave it....leave it....

1049
01:31:14,435 --> 01:31:18,098
l had only transferred the mill in
your name but not it's Godowns

1050
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:21,272
With what rights have you donated the
Goods of the Godown to the Govt.?

1051
01:31:21,509 --> 01:31:22,271
Give me an answer for this

1052
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:25,274
Don't you even know that the Godown's
are a part of the Mill?

1053
01:31:25,513 --> 01:31:26,275
That's why they are mine

1054
01:31:26,948 --> 01:31:29,382
Did you listen....did you
see the drama?

1055
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:36,087
Today, he's distributing the holy water
of my blood with the help of the law

1056
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:40,087
Darling, just think how much you've
made daddy to suffer losses

1057
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:40,885
Don't blabber...

1058
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:44,829
A woman with a little wisdom who
can't understand profits & losses

1059
01:31:45,099 --> 01:31:47,624
And a blind man like your daddy, l
haven't seen people like you till date

1060
01:31:48,369 --> 01:31:52,328
Had l not handed over the goods
concealed in the Godown to the Govt.

1061
01:31:52,573 --> 01:31:55,440
Then this daddy of yours would be
grinding a mill-stone in the jail

1062
01:31:55,877 --> 01:31:57,845
Had l not made the mill co-operative

1063
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:00,604
Then all the workers of the mill
would've poured kerosene on him

1064
01:32:00,915 --> 01:32:01,904
And would've burnt your daddy alive

1065
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:06,479
Even you keep talking without
understanding anything

1066
01:32:06,888 --> 01:32:10,449
One he saved your life, and upon
that you're accusing him

1067
01:32:10,758 --> 01:32:12,316
When you don't understand the
need of the situation

1068
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,050
Then, why don't you allow him
to do things on his own?

1069
01:32:14,295 --> 01:32:15,819
Come darling, let's go...
-come

1070
01:32:19,467 --> 01:32:22,664
Boss, you shouldn't talk rubbish
to son-in-law

1071
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:25,334
Who ever tells anything
tells it only to me

1072
01:32:25,673 --> 01:32:28,836
l don't understand anything
l'm son of a Gun

1073
01:32:30,845 --> 01:32:36,283
l understand, your son-in-law No 2
is a very complicated person

1074
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:42,080
But, don't worry, l'll take him to the club
some day & brain wash him

1075
01:33:02,476 --> 01:33:03,909
ls Mr. Prabhakar at house?

1076
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:11,381
No, sir has left for the office
at dawn itself

1077
01:33:11,852 --> 01:33:12,511
What, dawn?

1078
01:33:12,853 --> 01:33:14,286
Meaning, in the morning

1079
01:33:14,822 --> 01:33:19,316
Hey sir, since morning we're patrolling
from outside the office

1080
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:20,754
Nobody came here

1081
01:33:36,811 --> 01:33:39,143
Daddy, today will you not go
to office?

1082
01:33:40,681 --> 01:33:42,979
Son, l'll go, now it's only 8'O'clock

1083
01:33:44,652 --> 01:33:45,914
Who says that it's 8'O' clock?

1084
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:47,753
Just now, your mother told me

1085
01:33:48,089 --> 01:33:51,490
Papa, how many times l've asked
you not to speak a lie

1086
01:33:51,859 --> 01:33:54,020
You told mother that there's curfew
in the city

1087
01:33:55,029 --> 01:33:58,624
Son, the fact is that today a big
leader is going to die

1088
01:33:58,966 --> 01:34:00,524
That's why the office is closed

1089
01:34:01,268 --> 01:34:01,893
Madam...

1090
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:03,437
What's it?

1091
01:34:04,138 --> 01:34:05,901
Don't treat this as a complaint

1092
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:10,907
Sir has become too complacent
Collector sir is very angry on him

1093
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:16,416
Did you hear? lt will lead
you to 100 more lies

1094
01:34:16,851 --> 01:34:18,079
Lying is sin

1095
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:21,454
A good father will never lie

1096
01:34:21,856 --> 01:34:23,289
Come on, get ready quickly!

1097
01:34:23,524 --> 01:34:25,617
Sir, you go to school
you're getting late!

1098
01:34:29,196 --> 01:34:32,962
What are you seeing now? At last you
got a stick even from a kid, lsn't it?

1099
01:34:33,701 --> 01:34:38,161
lf Star is in the sky
what can cleverness do?

1100
01:34:43,711 --> 01:34:46,646
Get out. crowded the place with
lazy people

1101
01:34:46,881 --> 01:34:49,315
Filled the whole place with
Battalions of Wastrels

1102
01:34:49,550 --> 01:34:51,313
There's no work for you
get out from here

1103
01:34:51,585 --> 01:34:52,643
l don't want anyone here!

1104
01:34:53,421 --> 01:34:55,480
Sir, there's no rule to throw us
out like this

1105
01:34:55,923 --> 01:34:57,185
Teaching me rules?

1106
01:34:57,425 --> 01:35:00,292
l'll appoint or dismiss anyone
at my will & wish

1107
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:04,123
Come on, go out, shout slogans & demonstrate
do whatever you wish to do

1108
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:05,627
We don't need any workers here

1109
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:07,458
Come here!

1110
01:35:10,871 --> 01:35:11,303
Where did you go?

1111
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:13,640
To get flowers for the
flower vase

1112
01:35:13,874 --> 01:35:14,636
What's in it?

1113
01:35:15,543 --> 01:35:16,635
Sir, there's Powder & Creams in it!

1114
01:35:16,877 --> 01:35:20,472
You silly woman! everyone is out
to ruin me

1115
01:35:20,715 --> 01:35:23,309
Useless people with useless
expenditure are ruining me

1116
01:35:23,584 --> 01:35:24,642
You go out from here

1117
01:35:25,086 --> 01:35:26,815
What happened? Why're you
shouting on servants?

1118
01:35:27,088 --> 01:35:29,648
Mind your words
what's this shouting?

1119
01:35:30,091 --> 01:35:31,353
You're in your senses, lsn't it?

1120
01:35:32,259 --> 01:35:35,353
Perfectly alright! one who isn't
normal, l'll set it right

1121
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:37,692
Richness hasn't suited you

1122
01:35:37,932 --> 01:35:38,694
What did you say?

1123
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:42,866
l've said that neither you had food to
eat or place to sleep in that house

1124
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:45,033
l fought, got released you from there
and made you rich

1125
01:35:45,272 --> 01:35:46,204
..And have you started dominating me?

1126
01:35:47,608 --> 01:35:49,200
What's the matter?
what's happening?

1127
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:52,044
Where are you going?
-We've got the reply, sir!

1128
01:35:52,279 --> 01:35:54,713
Where are you going?
- Son-in-law has dismissed me from job

1129
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:03,648
What's the matter? Why've you
making her to cry?

1130
01:36:03,924 --> 01:36:05,186
Why did you dismiss all workers?

1131
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:07,356
How will the house run
without workers?

1132
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:15,028
What your age & wealth couldn't teach
you, now l'm going to teach you

1133
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,529
What did you say?
what'll you teach me?

1134
01:36:17,938 --> 01:36:20,372
l'll teach you, what's known
as Dignity of Labour

1135
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:23,034
Why do you need so many workers
for just 2 people?

1136
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:27,706
This Sher Singh's long moustache lsn't
useful to sweep also

1137
01:36:28,115 --> 01:36:29,548
Make him to do household work

1138
01:36:30,484 --> 01:36:32,042
You do your own work

1139
01:36:32,486 --> 01:36:33,919
..You make your daughter
to cook food

1140
01:36:34,321 --> 01:36:36,755
Modern time doesn't respect wealth
but it respects labour

1141
01:36:37,158 --> 01:36:39,092
Everyone has to do their
own work like me

1142
01:36:44,999 --> 01:36:47,092
Even my expectations got belied!

1143
01:36:47,334 --> 01:36:49,427
This man turned out to
be crazy

1144
01:36:50,004 --> 01:36:51,266
l shouldn't be saying this

1145
01:36:51,505 --> 01:36:53,097
lf you consider, l'll tell
you one thing

1146
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:53,772
What?

1147
01:36:54,175 --> 01:36:55,938
Our daughter is pregnant

1148
01:36:56,343 --> 01:36:58,607
By God's grace...

1149
01:36:58,846 --> 01:37:01,872
How are we concerned with
this crazy man?

1150
01:37:02,116 --> 01:37:03,879
l'll kick him out

1151
01:37:04,485 --> 01:37:07,420
lt's our own teeth & our own lips

1152
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:09,084
Keeping quiet is good

1153
01:37:09,323 --> 01:37:13,089
This is what l say, a good
thing should never be said

1154
01:37:18,332 --> 01:37:18,923
Don't worry!

1155
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:21,931
Shankar will pay your salaries
on time

1156
01:37:22,169 --> 01:37:23,431
Just do as he asks you to do!

1157
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:24,603
l didn't slap you strongly, lsn't it?

1158
01:37:25,005 --> 01:37:26,939
Sir, when did you slap me?

1159
01:37:27,842 --> 01:37:28,433
Champa, listen

1160
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:34,109
..You don't worry about it!

1161
01:37:43,224 --> 01:38:06,673
Prayer song!

1162
01:38:07,014 --> 01:38:10,108
Great sir! first you dismissed
us from work

1163
01:38:10,551 --> 01:38:14,112
Now, are you joining us in
singing prayer song?

1164
01:38:14,555 --> 01:38:15,613
This is a great new story!

1165
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:21,487
This isn't that! you're a worker
he's a worker

1166
01:38:22,062 --> 01:38:25,156
..l'm also a worker
we are brothers

1167
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:26,999
We all are workers

1168
01:38:28,235 --> 01:38:31,671
Look at these, he's the owner

1169
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:34,332
Do you know him?-Who's he?

1170
01:38:34,575 --> 01:38:35,337
Don't you know him?

1171
01:39:15,916 --> 01:39:26,554
He never open's the lock of his safe!
yes, my father-in-law is stinkingly rich!

1172
01:39:45,813 --> 01:39:55,916
When will he become insolvent?
yes, my father-in-law in stinkingly rich!

1173
01:40:13,207 --> 01:40:16,802
Move, don't make noise!

1174
01:40:18,545 --> 01:40:23,312
Move, don't make noise
don't bore my father-in-law!

1175
01:40:23,584 --> 01:40:28,351
Father-in-law is a good person
l agree, that he does illegal business

1176
01:40:28,589 --> 01:40:38,362
He's an owner of a big mill and
he has a small heart!

1177
01:40:38,599 --> 01:40:43,536
How did he acquire so much wealth?
l'll tell you how he acquired it!

1178
01:40:43,771 --> 01:40:48,208
By taking the name of destiny

1179
01:40:48,776 --> 01:40:55,545
By taking the name of Destiny
he sucked the blood of poor people

1180
01:40:55,783 --> 01:41:06,023
He plundered them in the garb of saint
yes, my father-in-law is stinkingly rich

1181
01:41:30,317 --> 01:41:40,090
Now, meet this fair lady
my sweet heart

1182
01:41:40,327 --> 01:41:45,094
How beautiful she looks
she looks like a helpless woman

1183
01:41:45,332 --> 01:41:55,105
She cheated the village & came here
she brought me to the city

1184
01:41:55,342 --> 01:41:59,938
She's little short but she's
a pawn in chess

1185
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:11,751
She plays such a trick
one may lose life saying it

1186
01:42:11,992 --> 01:42:16,588
What type of a woman l've got
myself entangled with?

1187
01:42:42,055 --> 01:42:45,821
Now, you ask me who's he?
..come on ask me!

1188
01:42:49,563 --> 01:42:51,827
Since, when he's silent?

1189
01:42:52,065 --> 01:42:56,832
He's servant of the master
...relative of Tommy!

1190
01:42:57,070 --> 01:43:06,604
He's neither a ladle nor a stick
he's a small spoon

1191
01:43:06,847 --> 01:43:11,614
He chases like dogs
he'll not leave if he catches

1192
01:43:11,885 --> 01:43:23,319
Doing good lsn't his work
but he's not disloyal

1193
01:43:23,564 --> 01:43:33,667
He's a protector of stolen goods
my father-in-law is stinkingly rich

1194
01:43:50,123 --> 01:43:55,220
lf l don't bash up this son-in-law my
name henceforth shall not be SherSingh

1195
01:43:55,462 --> 01:43:57,555
l'm not bothered about going
to jail also

1196
01:43:58,966 --> 01:44:02,493
ls it letter from mother?
she's keeping good health, lsn't it?

1197
01:44:02,736 --> 01:44:03,327
What has she written?

1198
01:44:05,072 --> 01:44:06,004
She has written...

1199
01:44:07,574 --> 01:44:10,008
Considering her trouble as my trouble
don't trouble daughter-in-law

1200
01:44:11,578 --> 01:44:13,842
Mother is getting lost in
daughter-in-law's troubles

1201
01:44:14,915 --> 01:44:17,008
Don't know into which web the
daughter-in-law is getting herself lost

1202
01:44:19,119 --> 01:44:22,179
Mother! this woman is in a
deep slumber

1203
01:44:23,790 --> 01:44:24,848
Forgive me, mother!

1204
01:44:26,126 --> 01:44:29,061
To wake her up, l had to perform
a distressing drama

1205
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:32,557
l can achieve success with
your blessings only

1206
01:44:33,467 --> 01:44:36,402
Go Shankar, lt's very late night!

1207
01:44:48,148 --> 01:44:51,242
l shouldn't say it, but
l've understood it!

1208
01:44:51,685 --> 01:44:57,453
Play such a drama that spectators
are left spellbound

1209
01:45:05,799 --> 01:45:07,733
Mother you?. here?

1210
01:45:08,635 --> 01:45:09,897
Ramcharan, what happened?

1211
01:45:10,637 --> 01:45:12,571
You've been bedridden

1212
01:45:12,806 --> 01:45:13,568
What am l to say?

1213
01:45:13,807 --> 01:45:16,901
Oh! don't get up! sleep

1214
01:45:19,479 --> 01:45:20,070
Mother!

1215
01:45:21,982 --> 01:45:24,746
You've put your servant on
a high pedestal mother

1216
01:45:27,187 --> 01:45:29,246
Did you get a letter written
by anyone?

1217
01:45:30,023 --> 01:45:32,787
Sudhakar has entrusted a
daily routine!

1218
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:35,293
l've made the postman to
write letter today

1219
01:45:36,029 --> 01:45:39,123
You haven't done good by returning
the money order

1220
01:45:39,866 --> 01:45:42,300
l'm not able to digest one
morsel of food

1221
01:45:42,869 --> 01:45:45,463
How can l keep so much money safely?

1222
01:45:45,706 --> 01:45:47,640
Sudhakar may get angry on you

1223
01:45:48,709 --> 01:45:51,473
Sudhakar can never get
angry on me

1224
01:45:52,713 --> 01:45:57,309
One should have belief like you
and devotion like Sudhakar has

1225
01:45:58,919 --> 01:46:01,410
lf anyone wants to pray Kausalya
they must pray to you

1226
01:46:02,522 --> 01:46:05,616
lf anyone wants to pray Lord Rama
they must pray Sudhakar

1227
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:09,625
l'll go! otherwise you'll go
on say something

1228
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:13,132
Don't worry about food

1229
01:46:15,702 --> 01:46:19,138
Mother put your foot on
cot's frame

1230
01:46:19,873 --> 01:46:20,805
Let me at least touch it

1231
01:46:23,043 --> 01:46:24,135
You are mad!

1232
01:46:24,878 --> 01:46:27,642
Sita dear, escort her to
the house

1233
01:46:28,215 --> 01:46:29,614
l'll do some how, child Sita help me
to get up

1234
01:46:38,925 --> 01:46:42,861
Ramcharan, l'm seeing
lot's of dreams

1235
01:46:44,097 --> 01:46:46,691
l can hear the flute of Lord Krishna

1236
01:46:47,768 --> 01:46:49,861
But, l can't find the path

1237
01:46:51,271 --> 01:46:53,705
You used to say that l've
a grandma

1238
01:46:54,107 --> 01:46:57,873
Son, yes, she is there, how did
you remember grandma?

1239
01:46:58,278 --> 01:47:01,645
Just like that, where does she
live, mummy?

1240
01:47:02,048 --> 01:47:05,814
Near Hasanpur, there is a small town
Rampur, she stays there

1241
01:47:06,253 --> 01:47:08,813
What's the name of my grandma?
-Parvati

1242
01:47:21,935 --> 01:47:25,029
Have you gone deaf? Where is the
tape of my pyjama?

1243
01:47:25,605 --> 01:47:27,038
l shouldn't say but....

1244
01:47:27,274 --> 01:47:30,038
Does Sher Singh put the tape
in his 'Dhoti'

1245
01:47:30,444 --> 01:47:32,537
Don't talk about 'Dhoti', but
where is it?

1246
01:47:32,946 --> 01:47:34,709
How do l know? lt must be
some where there only

1247
01:47:34,948 --> 01:47:36,882
Okay go & find out quickly

1248
01:47:37,150 --> 01:47:39,084
Every thing is urgent here

1249
01:47:39,319 --> 01:47:42,379
A single person should search the
tape or work here

1250
01:47:49,996 --> 01:47:52,760
Stop your singing! neither you
work yourself

1251
01:47:53,166 --> 01:47:54,929
Nor allow others to go to work

1252
01:47:55,168 --> 01:48:00,367
This'll continue like this boss
salutations to Lord Rama

1253
01:48:05,445 --> 01:48:07,037
Singing prayers

1254
01:48:08,782 --> 01:48:11,216
This Dharamdas will send all
of you to jail

1255
01:48:11,485 --> 01:48:13,043
l'll phone the police just now!

1256
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:15,584
Telephone is locked boss

1257
01:48:15,989 --> 01:48:17,547
Locked? Get the key quickly

1258
01:48:17,824 --> 01:48:20,759
Key is with secretary
Mr. Shankar Lal

1259
01:48:59,399 --> 01:49:00,764
There is neither salt
nor chillies

1260
01:49:01,167 --> 01:49:05,433
Do you think l'm a recluse or blood
pressure patient like your father

1261
01:49:05,672 --> 01:49:07,105
Tasteless food!

1262
01:49:08,174 --> 01:49:10,768
Eat it just as it is, she
doesn't know to cook

1263
01:49:11,511 --> 01:49:13,445
She would know only if she was
taught how to cook

1264
01:49:13,847 --> 01:49:16,111
You've made her to sleep on
velvet beds

1265
01:49:16,516 --> 01:49:17,778
You've rocked her in
Silver Cradles

1266
01:49:18,051 --> 01:49:19,484
Made her roam in
expensive cars

1267
01:49:19,886 --> 01:49:22,650
Even rich women can't survive
without knowing cooking

1268
01:49:22,889 --> 01:49:24,652
Have you ever exposed her
to that?

1269
01:49:25,892 --> 01:49:26,824
l never realised

1270
01:49:27,394 --> 01:49:29,988
That my daughter was fated to
marry a headstrong person

1271
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:32,494
Neither, l nor my daughter
will stay here

1272
01:49:32,732 --> 01:49:34,996
Come daughter, we'll go to our
bungalow on the hill

1273
01:49:37,404 --> 01:49:38,996
Come to your senses, Father-in-law

1274
01:49:39,573 --> 01:49:41,165
Your daughter is my wife

1275
01:49:41,408 --> 01:49:43,842
Nobody can dare to take my wife
away from me

1276
01:50:31,691 --> 01:50:36,788
Ramu rowdy long live
Ramu rowdy long live

1277
01:50:37,530 --> 01:50:39,293
Hey,remove that towel

1278
01:50:39,532 --> 01:50:40,294
How dare you!

1279
01:50:43,370 --> 01:50:47,306
Bring sweets, bring plantains

1280
01:50:49,542 --> 01:50:51,976
Give money to the blind woman

1281
01:50:57,417 --> 01:50:58,850
May God bless you

1282
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:08,873
l'm finished

1283
01:53:12,819 --> 01:53:19,725
l'm finished, save me

1284
01:53:26,666 --> 01:53:29,100
You are great master
you're great

1285
01:53:30,170 --> 01:53:32,604
You accept, then return the rupee
of the blind lady

1286
01:53:33,006 --> 01:53:33,597
Get up!

1287
01:53:42,348 --> 01:53:43,440
Take your rupee lady

1288
01:53:43,683 --> 01:53:45,446
God bless you son

1289
01:53:45,718 --> 01:53:48,152
For your benefit, you deprived
a handicapped

1290
01:53:48,388 --> 01:53:50,948
Not only the handicapped he is
looting all of us

1291
01:53:51,224 --> 01:53:52,816
He's pain in the neck for
all of us

1292
01:53:53,059 --> 01:53:56,654
Aren't you ashamed! so many people
are scared of one rowdy?

1293
01:53:56,896 --> 01:53:57,988
lf you don't protect yourself

1294
01:53:58,231 --> 01:53:59,823
Will an outsider come to
rescue you?

1295
01:54:00,066 --> 01:54:01,090
This leader is right

1296
01:54:01,334 --> 01:54:06,601
Beat him & throw him out of this
place, beat him....

1297
01:54:09,676 --> 01:54:10,438
Take this lady

1298
01:54:11,177 --> 01:54:13,111
May God reward you son

1299
01:54:31,064 --> 01:54:32,656
Son...-Mother

1300
01:54:35,235 --> 01:54:37,999
Where is my son? Go & search and
bring him back

1301
01:54:38,238 --> 01:54:42,004
Otherwise, l'll die....

1302

l'll bring him, l'll bring him

1304
01:54:54,621 --> 01:54:56,555
Mother, mother, mother..

1306
01:55:01,895 --> 01:55:03,829
Pack some food for the way

01:55:05,565 --> 01:55:07,658
There is no food, son

No son, l don't feel hungry

1310
01:55:24,617 --> 01:55:25,549

Don't say like this, brother

But don't feel ashamed to
identify your father

1331
01:57:19,565 --> 01:57:21,931
Son, forgive me for my misbehaviour

1332
01:57:22,502 --> 01:57:25,596
Forget Gauri's episode
About her....

1333

lf l say anything about her you can
punish me in any way you like

1334
01:57:41,821 --> 01:57:44,051
l don't know any Gauri

1335
01:57:44,924 --> 01:57:48,451
This man, looks like crook and
blackmailer to me

1336
01:57:49,862 --> 01:57:53,025
You Rascal, am l your step father?

1337
01:57:53,332 --> 01:57:54,424
That you are calling me
a blackmailer

1338
01:57:54,867 --> 01:57:55,891
infront of daughter-in-law....

1339
01:57:56,135 --> 01:57:58,365
You're calling your real father
a crook, rascal

1340
01:57:59,739 --> 01:58:00,671
What is this infront of
daughter-in-law

1341
01:58:02,075 --> 01:58:03,133
You rustic, idiot

1342
01:58:03,476 --> 01:58:04,135
l'm not a daughter-in-law

1343
01:58:04,377 --> 01:58:06,538
l'm only dating with him

1344
01:58:07,914 --> 01:58:10,906
You're keeping quiet & getting
me insulted, aren't you ashamed?

1345
01:58:13,152 --> 01:58:15,916
You bloody real father of mine

1346
01:58:17,690 --> 01:58:18,748
Do you know who l am?

1347
01:58:19,025 --> 01:58:20,515
You'll be shocked if l tell
you further

1348
01:58:25,865 --> 01:58:29,631
Oh pyare, he has again left
what should l do?

1349
01:58:29,869 --> 01:58:32,531
What else? give him 2 blows
by the stick & drag him

1350
01:58:32,772 --> 01:58:35,900
And expose his real identity
infront of the girl

1351
01:58:36,142 --> 01:58:37,905
Then only he'll come to his senses

1352
01:58:39,145 --> 01:58:45,084
Wearing a wig you're trying to
deceive me-leave me-l won't...

1353
01:59:07,907 --> 01:59:12,810
Hey watchman, brave man..

1354
01:59:23,356 --> 01:59:24,254
You don't know about him

1355

15 years ago, he was found in the
car dicky of a rich man

1356
01:59:28,961 --> 01:59:29,985
You don't know

01:59:30,463 --> 01:59:32,158
15 years ago!

1358
01:59:32,865 --> 01:59:35,629
Pyare, lsn't he the lost twin
brother of Murali?

1359
01:59:36,102 --> 01:59:38,969
You have recognized him correctly
he's definitely the same person

1360
01:59:39,272 --> 01:59:41,672
Son... -brother

1361
01:59:43,009 --> 01:59:45,876
My son, don't run

1362
01:59:46,112 --> 01:59:49,673
Why are you running away
from me?

1363
01:59:51,984 --> 01:59:54,885
You'll fall down, don't
run, Oh God!

1364
02:00:16,809 --> 02:00:23,237
Keep away from me...don't
come near me...

1365
02:00:29,021 --> 02:00:30,989
l'm having contagious disease, child

1366
02:00:31,958 --> 02:00:34,893
My shadow also should not fall
on anyone

1367
02:00:35,161 --> 02:00:38,130
lf l run away with fear then what'll
happen to sick people?

1368
02:00:39,365 --> 02:00:40,389
You drink water

1369
02:00:42,702 --> 02:00:46,695
Who are you to give me water?

1370
02:00:57,250 --> 02:01:00,708
Now l'm alright, you go

1371
02:01:00,987 --> 02:01:03,615
l can't leave you in this
condition & go

1372
02:01:04,423 --> 02:01:05,355
Come, come inside

1373
02:01:17,637 --> 02:01:21,334
Eat it, don't leave anything

1374
02:01:23,843 --> 02:01:26,403
Mother, don't you have any of your
own people?

1375
02:01:27,146 --> 02:01:31,446
Yes, l've two sons, daughters-in-law

1376
02:01:31,751 --> 02:01:32,513
Where are they?

1377
02:01:34,587 --> 02:01:36,782
One has gone away taking his wife

1378
02:01:38,524 --> 02:01:40,492
The other one has been taken
away by his wife

1379
02:01:41,661 --> 02:01:43,288
l'm left alone

1380
02:01:43,596 --> 02:01:44,688
Very bad....

1381
02:01:44,930 --> 02:01:46,693
Didn't you educate him?

1382
02:01:47,833 --> 02:01:50,461
No, one of them had studied B.A

1383
02:01:51,203 --> 02:01:53,569
And the second one had studied
up to high school

1384
02:01:54,340 --> 02:01:56,035
This is not written in
any book

1385
02:01:56,509 --> 02:01:58,272
That after getting educated one
should leave his mother

1386
02:01:59,278 --> 02:02:00,336
What sort of an education
is this?

1387
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:02,945
My grandmother stays somewhere
in this village

1388
02:02:03,182 --> 02:02:04,308
l'll stay with her

1389
02:02:04,684 --> 02:02:06,845
Let me know when your
sons come

1390
02:02:07,186 --> 02:02:09,017
l'll teach them that
'Mother is like Goddess'

1391
02:02:09,422 --> 02:02:10,354
What sons are they?

1392
02:02:11,724 --> 02:02:15,524
No matter however they are
but still they are my sons

1393
02:02:16,395 --> 02:02:20,331
What work does a mother have other
than to think of her sons well-being?

1394
02:02:21,701 --> 02:02:27,970
Wish l could see them for once
before l die, then....

1395
02:02:28,207 --> 02:02:29,299
Should l write them a letter?

1396
02:02:30,409 --> 02:02:32,843
l don't even know the address
of one of my sons

1397
02:02:33,245 --> 02:02:35,679
The address of the one whom you
know, what's his name?

1398
02:02:40,052 --> 02:02:40,984
And the second son?

1399
02:02:44,724 --> 02:02:46,055
And, what's your name?

1400
02:02:50,363 --> 02:02:51,591
You are my grandmother

1401
02:02:53,733 --> 02:02:54,757
What did you say?

1402
02:02:55,201 --> 02:02:56,668
Yes...you are my grandmother

1403
02:02:57,303 --> 02:02:59,271
How... ? ...who are you?

1404
02:02:59,839 --> 02:03:02,740
Why are you tormenting me, child?

1405
02:03:03,242 --> 02:03:04,266
l'm Krishna....

1406
02:03:05,644 --> 02:03:08,442
You are Krishna, but whose
son are you?

1407
02:03:09,048 --> 02:03:11,243
Grandma, my father's
name is Prabakhar

1408
02:03:11,917 --> 02:03:13,976
Hey, my Krishna...

1409
02:03:18,491 --> 02:03:24,054
For what good deeds of mine have
you appeared like God?

1410
02:03:24,697 --> 02:03:27,131
Grandma, don't cry...
don't cry

1411
02:03:33,339 --> 02:03:34,931
Oh! my fate!

1412
02:03:36,175 --> 02:03:41,044
Hey, my very dear sons bid adieu
to me

1413
02:03:42,548 --> 02:03:48,851
And my loving grandson came to
give me a send off to the God

1414
02:03:50,289 --> 02:03:51,847
Grandmother...grandmother...

1415
02:03:55,394 --> 02:03:57,692
Four frames -four frames

1416
02:03:58,497 --> 02:04:00,624
One table light -one table light

1417
02:04:01,367 --> 02:04:02,095
One watch...

1418
02:04:06,472 --> 02:04:07,939
Friend, l feel there's some
problem

1419
02:04:08,174 --> 02:04:11,974
l thought we'll have 1 or 2 pegs
and boost up our spirits

1420
02:04:13,913 --> 02:04:14,811
Let's push off from here....

1421
02:04:16,849 --> 02:04:19,079
Sir, you all have come at
a very right time....

1422
02:04:19,418 --> 02:04:21,181
l was thinking about you
people only

1423
02:04:21,887 --> 02:04:24,321
l need some money

1424
02:04:24,590 --> 02:04:27,388
Money....now a days who gives money
to anybody?

1425
02:04:27,693 --> 02:04:28,250
Hakkim sir...

1426
02:04:28,494 --> 02:04:30,985
Mr.Prabhakar, l myself have come
to you for some help

1427
02:04:39,772 --> 02:04:41,239
Tested the friendship?

1428
02:04:42,274 --> 02:04:46,438
You've set a good example to teach
a lesson to the world

1429
02:04:48,881 --> 02:04:50,781
Sir, what sort of a paper is this?

1430
02:04:51,016 --> 02:04:52,677
l found it in Krishna's drawer

1431
02:04:55,654 --> 02:04:57,679
This is...this is Krishna's letter

1432
02:04:57,957 --> 02:04:59,288
Krishna's...what has he written?

1433
02:05:00,025 --> 02:05:03,483
He has written that l'm going
to grandmother's house

1434
02:05:04,063 --> 02:05:05,155
Oh God!

1435
02:05:06,465 --> 02:05:08,126
Let's immediately go to mother

1436
02:05:08,634 --> 02:05:13,162
To mother? how can l
face my mother?

1437
02:05:13,672 --> 02:05:16,800
Your friends used you and
left you in lurch

1438
02:05:17,409 --> 02:05:21,743
But mother must be pining to see
you inspite of being hungry...

1439
02:05:22,381 --> 02:05:24,645
At least now, you understand the
importance of mother

1440
02:05:25,284 --> 02:05:27,844
But l don't have money even
for the fare...

1441
02:05:31,891 --> 02:05:35,520
Take this, you only gave me
you take it yourself

1442
02:05:37,263 --> 02:05:39,527
lf my money can be of
any use to you...

1443
02:05:40,199 --> 02:05:42,030
l'll be very fortunate...

1444
02:05:44,770 --> 02:05:45,737
Have the medicine

1445
02:05:46,071 --> 02:05:48,232
Medicine...medicine...medicine...
throw the medicine

1446
02:05:48,607 --> 02:05:51,371
How many times have l asked you
to bring my child to me?

1447
02:05:51,710 --> 02:05:54,736
l want to see my child and
breast feed him

1448
02:05:55,281 --> 02:05:56,680
Why don't you bring my child?

1449
02:05:56,982 --> 02:05:59,450
Sorry madam, he's sitting here
how can l bring the child?

1450
02:06:00,252 --> 02:06:04,552
Daddy, what's all this
bring my child to me

1451
02:06:04,890 --> 02:06:08,155
Daughter, don't worry, don't cry
you have your medicine

1452
02:06:08,494 --> 02:06:09,688
l'll try and make him
understand

1453
02:06:10,996 --> 02:06:12,224
Have the medicine...

1454
02:06:14,700 --> 02:06:17,669
Whatever it may be, but it's very bad
to separate a child from it's mother

1455
02:06:18,137 --> 02:06:20,162
Just now the delivery
took place

1456
02:06:20,439 --> 02:06:21,701
lf the child is not
breast fed...

1457
02:06:21,941 --> 02:06:23,738
Mother may develop 100 kinds
of problems

1458
02:06:24,243 --> 02:06:26,837
Doctor will tell 100 ways, for the
milk to come out

1459
02:06:27,246 --> 02:06:31,239
No...no...where's my child?

1460
02:06:31,483 --> 02:06:31,847
Don't go in

1461
02:06:32,184 --> 02:06:32,809
Where's my child...?

1462
02:06:33,619 --> 02:06:34,244
Stop...

1463
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:36,681
Leave me...let me see my child...

1464
02:06:36,956 --> 02:06:41,359
Leave me...my child...my child
leave me...

1465
02:06:43,062 --> 02:06:44,723
Didn't l tell you not to go
near the child?

1466
02:06:44,964 --> 02:06:46,124
Why did you come out of the room?

1467
02:06:46,398 --> 02:06:47,558
Will you not let me
to see my child?

1468
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:48,892
No...No....No...

1469
02:06:49,868 --> 02:06:51,233
Why are you doing this
injustice to me?

1470
02:06:51,971 --> 02:06:54,132
Why do you cut the heart of
a mother with a knife?

1471
02:06:55,307 --> 02:06:57,571
lf you have any complaint against me
then give me some other punishment

1472
02:06:57,977 --> 02:07:00,343
Why do you kill me after separating
me from my child?

1473
02:07:00,579 --> 02:07:01,841
Let me breast feed him

1474
02:07:02,581 --> 02:07:04,014
Your breast feeding
is cunning

1475
02:07:04,750 --> 02:07:07,514
Your milk will make my child to
do away with his responsibility

1476
02:07:08,621 --> 02:07:11,055
l'll never let my child
have your milk

1477
02:07:12,625 --> 02:07:15,560
lf Breast feeding my child is not
written in my destiny

1478
02:07:16,528 --> 02:07:18,723
Then at least let me see him

1479
02:07:19,298 --> 02:07:21,232
For once, let me embrace
my child

1480
02:07:23,969 --> 02:07:26,563
To germinate the feelings of affection
between a mother and her child

1481
02:07:26,972 --> 02:07:27,996
Now-a-days, it's out of date

1482
02:07:30,309 --> 02:07:34,245
Why are you taunting me, what harm
have l done to you?

1483
02:07:35,214 --> 02:07:37,910
l loved and married you, inspite of
you being poor

1484
02:07:39,018 --> 02:07:40,576
To come on par with
the big society

1485
02:07:40,853 --> 02:07:43,481
l gave you money, respect
and what not

1486
02:07:44,256 --> 02:07:46,747
The injustice you did to me
in lieu of my decency

1487
02:07:47,026 --> 02:07:47,958
l kept tolerating it

1488
02:07:48,861 --> 02:07:51,295
l'm leading my life like a slave

1489
02:07:51,864 --> 02:07:53,627
Even then, you're attacking me
one after the another

1490
02:07:54,266 --> 02:07:55,631
You have loved me?

1491
02:07:56,702 --> 02:07:58,966
You have not loved me, but
you have made fun of me

1492
02:07:59,938 --> 02:08:01,906
By keeping husband like a Toy
in your hands

1493
02:08:02,641 --> 02:08:05,075
You married me to dance in front
of the modern society

1494
02:08:06,145 --> 02:08:08,909
ln the strength of your father's
money for your coquettishness

1495
02:08:09,148 --> 02:08:10,740
You didn't want a husband
but a hired pony

1496
02:08:11,650 --> 02:08:12,742
By putting a collar around
my neck

1497
02:08:13,185 --> 02:08:15,119
You brought me from the hut to palace
for your own attractiveness

1498
02:08:15,688 --> 02:08:18,851
You never ever thought that the
basis of a Husband & a wife's relation

1499
02:08:19,525 --> 02:08:22,722
Lies in understanding, agreeing and
respecting each others feelings

1500
02:08:24,029 --> 02:08:28,295
Padma, you have not loved me
but you have cheated yourself

1501
02:08:28,701 --> 02:08:30,794
Yes, l've cheated myself

1502
02:08:31,704 --> 02:08:35,299
While getting trapped in your face
appearance, wisdom, l didn't knew

1503
02:08:36,041 --> 02:08:38,737
That l was handing over my destiny
in the hands of such a cruel person

1504
02:08:40,045 --> 02:08:42,980
Who'll make me long
even to see my son

1505
02:08:44,283 --> 02:08:47,480
You don't have a heart of a Man
yours is a heart made of steel

1506
02:08:48,087 --> 02:08:49,645
You're a beast and l cannot...

1507
02:08:54,093 --> 02:08:58,029
How dare you slap my daughter
right infront of me?

1508
02:08:58,430 --> 02:09:00,455
l kept tolerating you till date
in regard of her

1509
02:09:00,866 --> 02:09:01,958
But now, l'll no more
tolerate it

1510
02:09:02,534 --> 02:09:06,971
l'll not let my daughter lead her
life with a cruel man like you

1511
02:09:07,372 --> 02:09:08,964
l'll get her divorced
through law

1512
02:09:09,274 --> 02:09:13,301
Divorce...Excellent...
father-in-law, stick on to your words

1513
02:09:14,046 --> 02:09:17,140
lf you want, the problem of a husband
& a wife will definitely reach court

1514
02:09:17,716 --> 02:09:20,549
Now, the justice will not be done
in the house, but in the court

1515
02:09:22,421 --> 02:09:25,686
The result of miss-understanding between
a Husband & a Wife

1516
02:09:26,258 --> 02:09:27,350
Reaches till the extent
of a Divorce

1517
02:09:28,093 --> 02:09:30,027
According to the law, this is not
to be appreciated

1518
02:09:30,662 --> 02:09:31,526
We give you time

1519
02:09:32,264 --> 02:09:38,533
ln the next 12 months, if you're not able
to bridge the gap between yourselves

1520
02:09:38,771 --> 02:09:41,706
Then the court will grant divorce

1521
02:09:42,775 --> 02:09:46,711
The judgement on the most vital issue
of this case is still pending

1522
02:09:47,112 --> 02:09:48,374
That to whom should the child
be handed over?

1523
02:09:48,947 --> 02:09:51,040
The child is mine, he'll
stay with me

1524
02:09:51,683 --> 02:09:53,048
l request the court

1525
02:09:53,385 --> 02:09:54,545
That for the well being
of the child

1526
02:09:54,820 --> 02:09:56,048
He should be handed over
to her mother..

1527
02:09:56,488 --> 02:10:00,083
l strictly object this request in the
capacity of being the child's father

1528
02:10:03,162 --> 02:10:05,096
Let the Husband punish me in
the capacity of being my husband

1529
02:10:05,831 --> 02:10:07,924
Let the law punish me
in its own capacity

1530
02:10:09,334 --> 02:10:14,101
But l beg both of you not to
separate me from my child

1531
02:10:15,174 --> 02:10:20,441
Give me my child......
give me my child....

1532
02:10:23,515 --> 02:10:25,107
Sir, l think keeping the child
in some orphanage

1533
02:10:25,384 --> 02:10:26,942
ls a good solution to
this problem

1534
02:10:27,886 --> 02:10:28,944
l've no objection

1535
02:10:29,555 --> 02:10:32,820
No....l'll definitely not allow my
child to go to an orphanage

1536
02:10:33,458 --> 02:10:35,323
My child is not an orphan

1537
02:10:36,461 --> 02:10:38,986
The cruel person who can go to the
extent of being rude with servants

1538
02:10:39,898 --> 02:10:42,162
The drunkard who can get down to
foppishness & ruin my father's business

1539
02:10:43,235 --> 02:10:45,169
He can send his child
to an orphanage

1540
02:10:46,572 --> 02:10:50,338
But the one who has kept him
for 9 months in her womb

1541
02:10:51,410 --> 02:10:54,504
She can never tolerate this
till she's alive

1542
02:10:58,851 --> 02:11:01,445
A child is the biggest boon
in a woman's life

1543
02:11:02,588 --> 02:11:04,988
The most valuable gift given
by the destiny

1544
02:11:05,224 --> 02:11:08,421
The very thought of treating it
unclaimed is giving me shivers

1545
02:11:09,561 --> 02:11:12,655
instead of sending him to an orphanage
Handover my child to himself

1546
02:11:13,398 --> 02:11:16,834
l'll tolerate it....
l'll tolerate it......

1547
02:11:18,503 --> 02:11:25,033
l request that my dear child is brought
up with love & affection

1548
02:11:27,479 --> 02:11:31,006
He should be brought up
with love.....

1549
02:11:32,718 --> 02:11:36,347
Sir, l wanted this, l only wanted
this change to take place

1550
02:11:37,289 --> 02:11:40,383
May be a little late, not in the
house, may be in the court

1551
02:11:41,159 --> 02:11:45,562
You at least came to know the silky knot
of relationship of a mother & son

1552
02:11:45,797 --> 02:11:48,231
How tender and strong it is

1553
02:11:48,767 --> 02:11:53,067
Sir, l wanted to awake this mother's
affection & greatness

1554
02:11:53,305 --> 02:11:54,567
Lying dormant in a woman's heart

1555
02:11:55,540 --> 02:11:57,974
The woman who got astray in the
hazardous air of modern times

1556
02:11:58,577 --> 02:12:01,102
To teach her this lesson which she
forgot was my one & only aim

1557
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:04,171
That's why, l was forced to
enact this drama

1558
02:12:04,816 --> 02:12:06,841
This is absolutely wrong that
l was cruel to servants

1559
02:12:07,352 --> 02:12:09,786
l never ever tried to be crafty
with people who did favour to me

1560
02:12:10,355 --> 02:12:11,845
l don't have a habit of
getting down to fights

1561
02:12:12,691 --> 02:12:15,057
And l'm totally ignorant with the
taste of liquor

1562
02:12:15,827 --> 02:12:18,819
lf the court wishes, it can make
investigations on my statements

1563
02:12:23,568 --> 02:12:25,001
Sir, l shouldn't be telling this

1564
02:12:25,737 --> 02:12:28,831
l definitely went up to bring him
back to senses from intoxication

1565
02:12:29,408 --> 02:12:32,241
But, when he never drank, how could
l de-intoxicate him?

1566
02:12:32,978 --> 02:12:35,538
He was crying profusely reading
this mother's letter

1567
02:12:36,114 --> 02:12:39,743
...That l'm doing all this drama to
generate mother's love in my wife...

1568
02:12:40,252 --> 02:12:41,844
My Lord! This is the truth!

1569
02:12:43,889 --> 02:12:45,982
Sir, we were never dismissed
at all

1570
02:12:46,491 --> 02:12:48,925
Every month we are getting our
salaries regularly

1571
02:12:49,261 --> 02:12:51,126
Son-in-law is a God like man

1572
02:12:51,496 --> 02:12:53,123
He never committed any mistake

1573
02:12:54,132 --> 02:12:58,592
Sir, l'm not cunning, l'm not a tyrant
l'm not heartless

1574
02:12:59,471 --> 02:13:01,405
l'm a poor mother's simple son

1575
02:13:02,541 --> 02:13:05,567
Knowing very well about my
poverty, she had married me

1576
02:13:06,311 --> 02:13:07,710
After marriage, l expected

1577
02:13:08,113 --> 02:13:12,743
The mother whom l consider as Goddess
My wife should also respect her as one

1578
02:13:13,018 --> 02:13:13,450
....And serve her

1579
02:13:13,752 --> 02:13:16,118
But, turning her face away
from Humanity & civility

1580
02:13:16,888 --> 02:13:18,219
.....She turned my home
into a hell

1581
02:13:18,724 --> 02:13:22,285
Getting helpless & sorrowful, my mother
forced me to go with her

1582
02:13:22,828 --> 02:13:23,988
Getting severely hurt
my feelings

1583
02:13:24,563 --> 02:13:27,862
...l went with her to teach her
a lesson of mother's Greatness

1584
02:13:28,867 --> 02:13:32,132
Sir, All my actions were to
make me remember that vow!

1585
02:13:32,738 --> 02:13:35,605
l don't know whether this woman
knows this truth or not

1586
02:13:36,208 --> 02:13:39,143
The man who cheated my father
and was the cause of his death....

1587
02:13:39,511 --> 02:13:40,637
...Was her own father!

1588
02:13:43,915 --> 02:13:48,477
A mother who's getting so distressed
for getting separated from a 4 day old son

1589
02:13:49,421 --> 02:13:55,519
l don't know whether she could fathom
the love of mother for a 25 year old son

1590
02:13:58,263 --> 02:14:02,131
l don't want anyone's wealth
l don't want to enjoy it

1591
02:14:03,335 --> 02:14:04,529
No need of 12 month period

1592
02:14:05,303 --> 02:14:08,966
l'm ready to go away
immediately if she wishes

1593
02:14:09,274 --> 02:14:11,640
lf she's ready to be happy
with property given by me

1594
02:14:11,910 --> 02:14:13,810
l'm ready to leave the child also

1595
02:14:23,522 --> 02:14:25,456
My sins have repaid me

1596
02:14:26,558 --> 02:14:30,085
My bad behaviour with your mother
has left me faceless

1597
02:14:30,629 --> 02:14:32,688
l was ignorant

1598
02:14:33,932 --> 02:14:37,390
l've come to know what's a mother
only after becoming a mother

1599
02:14:38,270 --> 02:14:40,363
My son has brought me
back to my senses

1600
02:14:42,374 --> 02:14:47,869
Forget my mistake and forgive me

1601
02:14:49,614 --> 02:14:51,878
You've received a telegram

1602
02:14:56,521 --> 02:14:58,045
Whose telegram is it?
What's the matter?

1603
02:14:59,157 --> 02:15:00,021
Mother is seriously ill

1604
02:15:01,093 --> 02:15:02,185
Come, let's go quickly

1605
02:15:16,208 --> 02:15:16,867
Grandma, l've brought milk

1606
02:15:17,943 --> 02:15:21,401
My child, Today's your Grandpa's
death anniversary

1607
02:15:22,047 --> 02:15:23,981
You've to do all rituals...come

1608
02:15:33,024 --> 02:15:36,425
Child, he's your grandfather
pay your respects to him

1609
02:16:02,120 --> 02:16:04,088
You...who are you?

1610
02:16:06,124 --> 02:16:14,930
l'm a Milk man, what's your name?
Nandalala

1611
02:16:15,967 --> 02:16:21,200
Nandalala......everyone's caretaker
Krishna...Krishna...Krishna...

1612
02:16:23,141 --> 02:16:35,747
l was going away with a
desire in heart

1613
02:16:36,922 --> 02:16:54,238
You came at the right time.....
...at right time, Krishna

1614
02:17:46,191 --> 02:17:57,398
l bid adieu to everyone

1615
02:17:58,503 --> 02:18:09,505
But they never turned up to
bid adieu to me

1616
02:18:10,015 --> 02:18:17,444
The children couldn't manage even
this for a mother

1617
02:19:07,605 --> 02:19:18,573
How can l show my face
to this entire village?

1618
02:19:19,551 --> 02:19:30,291
l called everybody's name

1619
02:19:31,363 --> 02:19:38,394
How much l had waited but
no one turned up for me

1620
02:20:30,755 --> 02:20:33,417
Grandma not here...
please, lie on the cot

1621
02:20:34,426 --> 02:20:40,092
Son, no need of cot anymore
Everything is coming to an end

1622
02:20:41,599 --> 02:20:46,593
Please pour few drops of Holy Ganges
water into my mouth

1623
02:21:10,662 --> 02:21:11,253
Grandma!

1624
02:21:24,008 --> 02:21:24,440
Mother!

1625
02:21:51,870 --> 02:21:54,338
Mother....Mother

1626
02:22:04,415 --> 02:22:07,111
Mother, please forgive me
and then go away

1627
02:22:08,453 --> 02:22:11,889
Mother, l've come to know about
greatness of a mother very late

1628
02:22:14,792 --> 02:22:20,662
l committed the grave sin of separating
a son from a mother in her old age

1629
02:22:21,299 --> 02:22:23,494
Mother, please forgive me

1630
02:22:25,904 --> 02:22:27,428
l'm also responsible for
this destruction

1631
02:22:28,506 --> 02:22:30,667
You've given your life because
of me only

1632
02:22:32,944 --> 02:22:35,708
ln pursuit of worldly happiness
l forgot my responsibilities

1633
02:22:37,282 --> 02:22:42,219
l'm a bad man! l'm not fit
even to touch your feet

1634
02:22:43,187 --> 02:22:52,391
The time for the send off
has come

1635
02:22:53,698 --> 02:23:02,504
My children, why are you crying?

1636
02:23:03,474 --> 02:23:07,501
Laugh!, why are you mourning?

1637
02:23:09,047 --> 02:23:12,676
Look at the smile on my face

1638
02:23:13,117 --> 02:23:17,884
Look at the pride on a
mother's last journey

1639
02:23:18,990 --> 02:23:28,228
There's no thirst in the heart
no wish is left unfulfilled

1640
02:23:28,933 --> 02:23:38,069
l saw you as a flower in my lap
l saw you as a withered flower also

1641
02:23:38,643 --> 02:23:42,238
l've seen sons, daughters-in-law
and grandchildren

1642
02:23:43,548 --> 02:23:47,951
l've seen all my works
getting fructified

1643
02:23:48,886 --> 02:23:53,414
All my duty is over

1644
02:23:53,725 --> 02:23:58,287
My duty as a mother is over

1645
02:23:59,430 --> 02:24:01,057
Mother may go away...

1646
02:24:01,299 --> 02:24:08,398
But a mother's love will not
perish from this world

1647
02:24:09,407 --> 02:24:18,748
You all are bits & pieces
of my heart

1648
02:24:19,083 --> 02:24:23,577
Stay together in this house

1649
02:24:24,589 --> 02:24:43,703
l'll visit this house as cool
eastern breeze

1650
02:24:44,242 --> 02:24:48,804
Bid adieu
