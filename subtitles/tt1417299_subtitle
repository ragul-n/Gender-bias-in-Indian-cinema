182
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,183
..will accept the matters very late.

183
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,124
So, what is the stand of Pakistan
on the issue of terrorism?

184
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,455
-A fiction program.
-How many Kg?

185
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,530
-3 kg!
-One day before the disaster happened..

186
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,794
..in America on September 1 1th,

187
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,199
Musharaff, the president
of Pakistan calling Bush,

188
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,864
The president of America on hot line.

189
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:11,204
Bush get up from the sleep.
What happened then. . .

190
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,538
Please watch yourself

191
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,470
Hi.. Hallo.. Natasha

192
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,751
Hello!

193
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,884
Hello, America?

194
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,690
-Yeah!
-Who is speaking?

195
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,697
Why are you yelling like this?

196
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,427
Who will speak on the hot line..

197
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,765
lt's me.. President George Bush

198
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,967
l am Musharaff calling..

199
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,236
..from Pakistan on the hot line.

200
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,905
Oh, Mush! What's the matter?

201
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:54,850
l feel very much sorry about
the disaster for your nation.

202
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,646
What happened?

203
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:02,989
Thousands of people died.
Many buildings were collapsed!

204
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:07,721
Pakistan also will participate
in your sorrow..

205
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:11,325
The terrorism should be
uprooted any cost.

206
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,929
Even spend millions
to eradicate the terrorism.

207
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,271
With the financial assistance got from
from World Bank, Pakistan

208
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:21,676
should take revenge for
that happened on 9/1 1

209
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,010
9/1 1? What are you blabbering?

210
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:27,210
What are you blabbering
as 9/1 1 , Mush Night..

211
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,550
Sorry, there is a time difference.

212
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,022
l should call you tomorrow, September 1 1

213
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,490
l forget it!

214
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,959
Forgive me!

215
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,062
This is inspector Sethu.

216
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,131
Sethu will take care of you

217
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,202
l am waiting for you for half an hour.
Come on let's go.

218
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,135
-He will not come?
-Then?

219
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:50,208
He will
send two constables later

220
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,276
Two?

221
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,276
That is not enough.

222
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,348
At least there should be 4..
then only. . .

223
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,146
Let's see

224
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,344
Let's see. . . again?

225
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,679
You have to be in the assembly.

226
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,152
Anyhow, lf l get the justice
that's enough.

227
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,621
See you!

228
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,498
Sir, boys were playing cricket
in the ground.

229
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,624
Local juniors.

230
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,565
His window glass had been broken.

231
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:18,966
That is the report.

232
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,236
2 constables are enough for him

233
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,501
Protection is not for him. But for CM

234
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,634
lf you didn't give security,
he will go there.

235
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,439
Then we have to give seven or eight.

236
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:31,310
After seeing him, many like him
will start the same. Okay?

237
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:35,109
BUSH AND MUSH.
With Natasha Rajkumar.

238
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,050
So!

239
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,318
So Pakistan does not have any hand
in this terrorism

240
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:42,792
No..! Certainly not.
Our Thalidhan..

241
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,456
No, Our Pahiban
is not this one.

00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,935

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,627
-No more excuses.
-Yes sir

374
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,104
Yes Mr. Marar.

00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,300
l am sorry. l don't
believe in formalities

377
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:20,540
Neither do l

378
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:24,243
lf you stand, l can't look
at the map clearly.

379
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:25,976
-That is why l asked you
to sit -Thanks

380
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:32,019
Yes tell me

381
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,818
Few minutes back
l got a call in my cell

382
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:51,164
lt should be a prank call.
What do you think?

383
00:31:57,015 --> 00:32:03,181
Zakriya trace this call.
Hello

384
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:07,185
Mr. Marar! Who is going
to negotiate with me?

385
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:10,928
Mr. Edward is coming.
Till then you can talk to me

386
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:16,399
l will negotiate only with the one
who can take all the decisions..

387
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:20,232
l think l already told that to you..
Don't waste my time.

388
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:25,471
-l'll call you in 5 minutes bye..
-Hello

389
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,478
Sir, it was a very short call.
Couldn't trace..

390
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,616
lt is not from the same number sir

391
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,745
Sir, there was a call from the
Wall Tax road police station..

392
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,079
There is nobody in the name
of Thayumanvar in that address.

393
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:41,082
All the police stations in Chennai
should be in stand by.

394
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,352
l want 100 percent compliance.

395
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:47,089
-Sir. -Did you meet Commissioner?
-Yes sir. What problem? -l'll give to him

396
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,765
-Yes sir -Marar
-Yes sir

397
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:52,767
Who is Edward?

398
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,304
There is no senior police officer
in the name of Edward

399
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,701
No such officer. Just to buy time,
l told a lie sir

400
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,436
-lf anything happened wrong?
-Will not happen.

401
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,739
Before that we can.. but if you talk,
it will be good sir

402
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,473
ls he threatening you
that he put bombs?

403
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,548
lf he put bombs as he told..

404
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:11,480
There could be death and destruction..
as there is no ultimate authority like you

405
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:12,556
-Give to the madam
-Yes

406
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:18,020
-l will give.
-lt won't be good if l talk.

407
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:19,619
Sir, yes sir. Yes..

408
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:21,964
Then situation will rise as anybody
can talk to CM.

409
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,761
You can handle it yourself.

410
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,635
-No.. yes.. What sir.. Me?
-Yes!

411
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:33,232
Sir, authority okay sir..
if you tell me.. l'll do it. -Take care of it

412
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:40,783
Mr. Marar, CM has given me the power
to take decision related to this

413
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:42,716
So, you are the official negotiator. Good

414
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,846
l can. But, this is law and
order problem.

415
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:50,716
Terrorists. Bomb threat, strategically
correct move. . .

416
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:52,455
..is to be handled by the
police department.

417
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:54,192
lt's your home pitch!

418
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:56,665
CM won't.

419
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,066
lf Chief Secretary can't,
who else can?

420
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,536
Police.. DGP. . . don't know.

421
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:04,397
lf nobody can't
Why not? l will handle

422
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:05,936
But, but on one condition.

423
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,275
There should be no hindrances.
No interference no red tape

424
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,749
Will not be there.
Even though a word with CM

425
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:15,215
l said no interference, whatsoever.
You can decide.

426
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:16,715
They gave the power to you.

427
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,289
So no shuffling back and forth
it won't be strategically correct

428
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,423
Right, you take it up Mr. Marar.
lts all yours.

429
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,154
Nobody will ask any
question for anything

430
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:29,756
-lt is your promise!
-My promise is C.M's promise.

431
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:31,560
Take it up Mr. Marar.

432
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:34,301
l am giving it as an order.
lt's all yours.

433
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:36,965
You will win it and stop, but..

434
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,908
-lf didn't win, isn't?
-Not like that. -Fine.

435
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,309
lf won, all of us can share the success.

436
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,038
Well grossed and deserved
to be shared.

437
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,911
lf failed, then you
want me to resign. ls it so?

438
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,748
No Mr.Marar.
But question may rise.

439
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,053
-Someone have to..
-Take the blame

440
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:55,523
-No.. the responsibility
-lf fails, isn't.

441
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,853
l will take the blame
sorry responsibility all alone!

442
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,398
..should be a scapegoat
and l am ready to be one.

443
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:04,662
Not only Kerala.
This is my land too.

444
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,327
l will do my work.
Come on guys

445
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,665
-Back to work
-Mr. Marar.

446
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:09,405
lf you think its going to be a. . .?

447
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:10,734
-Sir, phone
-lt is him!

448
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:17,948
Hello!

449
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,414
Mr. Marar! Where is Edward?

450
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:21,750
He will not come

451
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,284
How will he come
when there is nobody like that?

452
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:26,355
This is the last warning.
Do not fool around with me.

453
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,025
Who is going to negotiate with me?

454
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,356
CM, PM, some under secretary. Who?

455
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:36,894
Do you expect the CM and
PM to come to your call?

456
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:39,769
They told like that when they
came to seek votes.

457
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:42,229
l think that now they are busy
after got the power.

458
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:44,231
Let them come after the bomb blast.

459
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,503
Now, who is going to talk with me?

460
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:49,373
Some secretary, lAS officer

461
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,310
l will talk to you

462
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:54,813
-Whatever.. -What you want?
Anything lawful

463
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,513
-Lawful
-l don't understand

464
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,057
No, no. it's an inside joke.

465
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,720
l have many in laws.

466
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:10,059
Ahmadulla, lnayathula,
Abdulla, Karamchand lala

467
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,068
l understand. They are..

468
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,797
You forget who they are!

469
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:18,734
You arrested two of them in
Coimbatore bomb blast case.

470
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,773
Another two were arrested by your
department from Kanyakumari..

471
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:23,005
..and one from Madurai.

472
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:24,612
What should l do with them?

473
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:25,613
Nothing. Release them.

474
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,681
l think there will be
no problem for you

475
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:31,682
There is no problem.
lt has become usual.

476
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,421
Have to catch by taking risk
of our lives, then release them..

477
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:39,562
..when get a call from a
politician or terrorist.

478
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:42,422
And we have to collect the
bodies of our colleagues..

479
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,868
..and go home directly. lt became usual

480
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:48,901
l have no time
to console you.

481
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:54,168
Three persons among the four
are in your city jail.

482
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:56,576
One poor guy is in Bangalore jail.

483
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,708
l will call within an hour.

484
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:00,443
Before that all of them
should be at one place.

485
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,042
lf you waste the time, any how
it will be evening.

486
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:03,984
lt'll be 6'o clock.

487
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:08,122
Whether it will be in the
public place, bus or train.

488
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,660
You would not know where it would
explode, but l know. Bye Bye!

489
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,320
Hey.. Wait!

490
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:15,396
Are you serious?

491
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:20,998
Do you think that one wastrel
plays with you? Mr. Marar

492
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:22,800
You don't even own a name!

493
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,870
-Even the cell phone is not in your name
-Okay.

494
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:30,079
Now your intelligence might have smelt
and told about my number..

495
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:31,273
..where from it came and all.

496
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:32,679
Still, let me update you.

497
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:36,411
First time l called in the name
of Thayumanavar.

498
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,853
He died in the Coimbatore bomb blast.

499
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:42,958
Second call was from
Yashwanth Koladkar.

500
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:45,891
Died in Mumbai blast.

501
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:50,098
Third one was Asha Barua.

502
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:54,434
She and her daughter died
in Gowhati.

503
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,904
Child was in her womb.
She was pregnant.

504
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:00,640
All are in the list of the dead.

505
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,903
l have no attachments
with the living ones.

506
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,447
4 sim cards. One mobile phone.

507
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:07,375
Any Tom, Dick and Harry
can threaten to win anything.

508
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:08,643
So what you think?

509
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:13,323
There is 3 kg RDX bomb primed..

510
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:15,851
..and ready to blast in the
Anna Salai police station..

511
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:17,321
..within the commanding area
of Mr. lGR Marar..

512
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:18,725
..it will explode in 20 minutes.

513
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,727
Can any Tom, Dick and Hari do this?
Mr. Marar

514
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:24,798
-ls it true?
-Go and see.

515
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,597
You can understand
if it is true or not.

516
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:28,966
This is not in that list of 5.

517
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:33,970
Just like a free sample like something
given by the sweet shop.

518
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:41,383
lt will blast within 20 minutes
Starting now

519
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:48,325
Hello! lt is a
fairly long call.

520

He has used cocaine to bear the pain

A stranger has informed us

That means you are an accessory... Do you
know what we can do with an accessory?

For others? Let them

00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:54,870
What kind of a person are you?

Slow! Why do you talk in English?

710
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:52,057
Due to some reasons regarding the
security, we have to speak in good Tamil.

00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,722

712

We can listen what the senior inspector
Sethuraman has to say about that.

719
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:20,748
What is the urgency in
transferring the terrorists?

720
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:23,086
lt is for some reasons
regarding the security.

721
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,091
l have no permission
to tell about it.

722
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,286

you are shifting them.

We can understand that they are not
interested to answer our questions.

00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:06,030

No problem for the election result

785
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:50,441
Because, if our opposition parties know
about it, they will arrange press meet

786
01:00:50,546 --> 01:00:52,036
..and spread the news immediately.

787
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:54,275
Every party has its own channel.

788
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:55,408
Yes sir

789
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:58,180
Nothing should happened
to 30 lakhs people.

790
01:00:58,454 --> 01:00:59,785
Do you need any help from the central?

791
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:01,254
From the central, any help..?

792
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:02,825

Did he ask why you didn't finish yet?

797
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:14,133
lf you ask me, what can l do?

798
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,000
What do you want me to do?

799
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:20,041
Should l take a gun and run
through Mount Road like a mad man?

800
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,537
Tell me.
We can do.

801
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:24,409
Would the control get
transferred to us then?

802
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:25,446
Come on, what do you think?

803
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:26,708
Mr. commissioner!

804
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:28,440
Please remember whom you are talking to.

805
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:30,485
Chief Secretary, Government of Tamil Nadu

806
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,178
l am not a secretary to anyone.

807
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:35,017
l am an ordinary commissioner of police
in the uniform.. even ready to die.

808
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:36,455
A glorified constable.

809
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:37,992
l am doing my duty.. that's all

810
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:40,486
Mr. Marar! Don't take it personally

811
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:43,158
You told that two officers
are going with that terrorist.

812
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:44,233
Who are they?

813
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,468
Two officers from my team

814
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:49,062
Many senior officers are here.

815
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:51,538
Mr. Periya karuppan.
What is his name Mr. Ramachandran?

816
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:55,667
-Who went to Mumbai on deputation in
the period of '96 blasts... -That is right!

817
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:56,745
You should have asked him!

818
01:01:57,046 --> 01:02:01,415
You gave me permission to work
freely without any interruption.

819
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,618
Do you still stand by that or not?

820
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,083
No other way. . . that four persons?

821
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:08,620
We can leave them now
and again catch them later.

822
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:09,555
Dead or alive

823
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:13,224
lf the public ask about
the terrorists in heavy security..

824
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:16,490
..do you want me to answer
as we will leave and catch?

825
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:18,430
There was a small crack in the security.

826
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:19,827
Using that they escaped.

827
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:21,034
Don't we have the reasons to tell?

828
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:24,430
Dismissing the commissioner
for his irresponsibility.

829
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:27,367
Even you can tell like this,
very happily in the press conference

830
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:30,503
Mr. Marar, you have caught
the tail of a tiger

831
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:33,240
Soon l will catch the head also.

832
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:34,581
Don't worry

01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:42,988

Their names are Abdhulla, Ahmathulla,
lnayathulla and Karamchand.

We can watch what the senior officer

837
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:58,734
Mr. Sethuraman, what is the reason for
transferring the terrorists suddenly.

838
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:11,375

-Too much.

861
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:35,634
Only two persons should go.

862
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:38,801
Ask them to bring two cell phones too.

863
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:43,003
Speaker facility and conference
facility should be in that cells

864
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:46,682
-Conference call for all
-Sure

865
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:48,348
One more thing.

866
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:52,418
l put bombs around the airport.

867
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,352
That is for our safety.

868
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:58,023
So don't experiment with snuffer dogs,
commando action etc.

869
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:01,490
The number of police widows
will be increased.

870
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:03,292
l want to know one thing

871
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:06,091
l don't have no time

872
01:05:06,802 --> 01:05:07,826
Why do you act like this?

873
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:13,038
Hide, run and threatening to achieve
the matters are not good for a warrior.

874
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:14,768
Come to the light and fight.

875
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:19,243
-Brave death for you or for me
-Good speech

876
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:21,375
We are cowards.

877
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,850
And you be the warriors
in uniform.

878
01:05:23,953 --> 01:05:26,513
Get the DA, TA, gallantry award and all.
And be happy.

879
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:28,817
Don't waste the time
by teasing me.

880
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:32,258
-You have no time for that Mr. Marar
-Ok!

881
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:33,726
lf we release these 4 persons,

882
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:35,796
what is the guarantee that
you will tell about the places..

883
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:36,728
..where you kept bombs

884
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:41,069
To give guarantee and warranty,
am l selling pressure cookers?

885
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:44,599
Why thousands of innocent people
should die?

886
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:46,536
What sin they have done?

887
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:48,404
Relax commissioner sir

888
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:49,676
Believe me.

889
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:51,941
There is no other way.

890
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:56,942
lf you obey me as l told, l'll leave
your city as a peaceful garden.

891
01:05:57,053 --> 01:06:00,420
All right
l will call at 5'o clock. . .bye.

892
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,515
Zakriya, now we have talked more.

893
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,253
-Have you traced the call?
-We tried sir.

894
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:07,453
lt was quite interesting.
When we trace, the call goes somewhere

895
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:09,326
-You told that he is in the city
-He is in the city sir.

896
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:10,988
But different countries.
Different places

897
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,397

01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:17,903
Edinburgh in Britain.
Singapore, Maldives..

901
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,601
-lf he can go all these places in
lightning speed! -He should be a Superman!

902
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:23,872
Sir, l think he made a route
through the computer.

903
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,345
He should be a communication specialist

904
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:26,938
You cant find, isn't?

905
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:29,617
-Sir. lf we get an expert advisor. . .!
-What type of expertise?

906
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:32,882
to precise router hacker,
stealthy recon, remote sniffing sir

907
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,547
Get me an expert in the field.

908
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:35,817
Speak to lAT quick.

909
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:37,290
Then, it is very important.

910
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:41,758
After bringing the terrorists to the strip,
block the whole traffic in that side

911
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:43,957
-Sir -When we need,
we can clear it later -Ok sir!

912
01:06:44,066 --> 01:06:46,364
-Private plans,
Flight plans look all etc.. -Sir

913
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:50,095
God, l hope they will not hijack
any passenger carrier.

914
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:53,897
Sir. Sub inspector is waiting,
he says he has seen the man.

915
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:57,670
He told the name as Srinivasa Ramanujam.

916
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,982
This is the address and
phone number he gave. . .

917
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:04,184
ln the hand a black bag with
the photo of Lord Venkateswara.

918
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:05,818
He has beard sir.

919
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:07,319
How was the beard?

920
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:12,225
Beard like this..

921
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:13,485
Like this.

922
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:16,394
Name is Srinivasa Ramanujam
with Thirupathi bag.

923
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:19,834
-Then what? A cross on the neck?
-No sir

924
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:23,098
He purposefully confused you.

925
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:24,465
Otherwise you were
confused by yourself

926
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:27,041
No sir.. l can remember clearly.

927
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:29,777
He came to complaint that
his purse was pick pocketed.

928
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:32,971
-He came..
-Any more details about him?

929
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:34,576
Think about it and tell.

930
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:38,810
He was left handed sir

931
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:40,756
-Sethu
-Sir

932
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:42,253
l tried the number.

933
01:07:42,491 --> 01:07:44,083
Message came as this number
is not in use.

934
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:46,588
Asked to verify the Ashok Nagar address.

935
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:50,094
For what? Surely it will
not be his address.

936
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:53,433
To give real address, is he a fool?

937
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:56,397
Call the computer graphics staff.

938
01:07:56,872 --> 01:07:58,863
As per his instructions,
ask to develop his photo.

939
01:07:59,075 --> 01:07:59,939
Where is Rafeeq?

940
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:02,738
Sir, from the general hospital lCU,
he was brought to the General ward.

941
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,812
-Show the photo to him also
-l will confirm it sir

942
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,944
Time is up. So far no information!

943
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:12,312
One minute.

944
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:14,780
-Hello
-Ms.Natasha.

945
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:18,892
Do you know Chozhavaram old airport?
Car races will be conducted there.

946
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:20,018

947
01:08:20,396 --> 01:08:22,057
-Excuse me

01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:25,526
-l can't hear.
-You using me.

949
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:29,635
Of course if you had no interest,
you might've told then itself.

950
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:32,932
You are trying to use me indirectly
and l am being a party too

951
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:36,010
Come on Natasha.
Don't flatter yourself.

952
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:38,877
lf lndia loses a cricket match
against Pakistan..

953
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:43,884
..nobody will blame the TV channel
that telecast the match.

954
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:45,385
You are just showing

955
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:47,613
But this is not a cricket match, damn it!

956
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,350
Absolutely it is not that.

957
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:52,283
There is no scarcity
for the reporters like you,..

958
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:54,089
..taking the mike and roaming.

959
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,422
News makers like me are rare.

960
01:08:56,599 --> 01:09:01,935
-So say yes or no
-Yes

961
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:06,474

01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:28,387
Sir, that Ashok Nagar address..
There is no such apartment block sir

965
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:32,126
-Obvious. Did Arif come?
-On his way sir

966
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:35,735
Both of you go to the armory
and be ready. l will see you there. Sir.

967
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:11,364
-Sir
-Arif, ok?

01:10:12,174 --> 01:10:13,163
-l am fine sir
-Good.

969
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:14,765
These are the new
bullet proof vests.

970
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:16,239
Thanks to late Mr. Karkare.

971
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:19,542
Keep your fingers and hope the bullets
hit these and not your head.

972
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:20,976
Whose face you saw
first in this morning?

973
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:22,573
-Bed room mirror
-l thought so.

974
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:24,115
More trouble coming your way.

975
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:26,712
You are directly going
to Puzhal jail.

976
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:30,386
There those 4 prisoners
will be handed over to you

977
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:32,460
This is the order to shift them

978
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:34,993
We are going to talk
in the conference call.

979
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,563
Check the speaker in your mobile.

980

When l talk to him
you must listen very carefully

981

-Get the best driver in the squad
-Already arranged sir

982
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:47,066
Whatever happened, the vehicle
should not stop in the way. Be careful.

983
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:51,273
Good. Keep your senses as sharp

984
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:53,545
From now on
Chennai is in your hand.

985
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:55,377
Don't panic in any
circumstances.

l trust you to keep your head.

990
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:36,389
After completing everything
you should take care of Arif.

991
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:40,622
l know it sounds illegal
but you understand the logic

992
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:41,923
Understand sir

993
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:02,434

That is why you are here. . .

Can you operate the computers here?

01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:23,097
These are old as our forefathers.

1002
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:26,429
-Praying the ancestors l will try
-Go ahead

1003

Officer is asking..
Do you know his name?

1021

May be some Babu

1022
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:58,580
Our men who go to work
will either change the name

01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:00,813
..or will not disclose.

1024

What? Are they able to kill?

They are fearing and shivering

01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,178
l have no fear.

1032
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:36,586
Who will fear when one is ready to die?

1033
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:39,590
Hey Lala, do you have fear?

1034
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:42,593
We are in this work.
We have to face it.

1035
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:45,461
Leave me. Let me go off.

1036

lt seems the train is late by one hour

01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,088
That too the compartment
is empty today

1042

Wife, third wife.

1051
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:55,063

Went to Bakery to buy cake.
Best bakery. You might have heard.

1055
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:18,349
Time was bad.
There was riot!

1056
01:18:19,594 --> 01:18:21,619
They came as a crowd.

1057
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:24,758
They boiled and threw them out.

1058
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:30,565
..not the cake but my wife and my son

1059
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:32,430
Leave it. Even lost one,
don't you have two more..

1060
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,168
-Adjust with that
-Keep quiet

1061
01:18:35,343 --> 01:18:36,571
Police too were keeping quiet

1062
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:41,449
Police were just watching!

1063
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:47,187
lf he shouted a little, my son might
not be in the heaven now.

1064
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:49,580
Might be playing
in the house

1065
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:52,119

Wow!

You should fight there,
then you will understand. . .

01:19:00,769 --> 01:19:02,464
lf you fight. . . You will be dead

1072
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:14,875
Like him, those bear a Muslim name. . .

Nothing

1118
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:04,040
Did they compel to eat anything?

They put hand cuff, that it would
look good on the hand.

1120
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:10,046
Don't worry, that will be unlocked soon.

1125
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:30,765
-Yes!
-You keep away from that jeep.

1126
01:23:30,872 --> 01:23:34,103
l need a lot of space
on the landing strip.

1127
01:23:34,275 --> 01:23:37,244
The four warriors may board the jeep.

1128
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:40,041
You return back to commissioner office.

1129
01:23:40,148 --> 01:23:43,049
You all go towards the jeep.

1130
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:46,985
lnayathulla in the driving seat.
Ahmathulla in the near by seat.

The other two persons in the back seat.
You must sit in this order.

1132
01:23:50,425 --> 01:23:51,915
This is the order l got

1133
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:55,861
lnayathulla, l know you can drive
the vehicle very well.

1134
01:23:55,964 --> 01:23:59,866
Key is in the jeep. lf you board on it,
you will understand where to go.

1135
01:23:59,968 --> 01:24:00,935
Phone will come.

1136
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:03,334
All these should happen
within 10 minutes.

1137
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:05,670
Mr.commissioner!

1138
01:24:05,774 --> 01:24:06,672
Are you listening?

1139
01:24:06,775 --> 01:24:08,470
Yes continue

1140
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:11,010
Arif after coming with his
colleague to your office..

1141
01:24:11,112 --> 01:24:13,080
..l will tell
where the bombs are.

1142
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:15,148
Ok. Listen up everybody,

1143
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:20,617
Your ten minutes starts now.

1144
01:24:20,789 --> 01:24:22,723
Arif, do as he said

1145
01:24:22,824 --> 01:24:24,018
Right sir

1146
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:33,163
Go!

1147
01:24:38,606 --> 01:24:39,903
Excuse me

1148
01:24:40,809 --> 01:24:42,504
Surely this is a local call

1149
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:44,703
lf it comes again,
l will tell exactly

1150
01:24:44,813 --> 01:24:49,182
-Are you sure? -Absolutely!
He is brainy but not an expert.

1151
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:02,258
Arif, what are you doing?
Leave him

1152
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,921
What if they escape without knowing
the information about the bombs?

1153
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:07,058
lt will be a big mistake

1154
01:25:07,168 --> 01:25:08,066
lt's commissioner's order

1155
01:25:08,169 --> 01:25:09,193
Let it be.

1156
01:25:09,304 --> 01:25:10,794
We released the other three,

1157
01:25:10,905 --> 01:25:12,338
we will take him with us.

1158
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,533
After knowing the information
about bombs, we can release him

1159
01:25:14,642 --> 01:25:16,075
l am going to call the commissioner

1160
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:18,542
Even if he orders, l will not release him.

1161
01:25:18,646 --> 01:25:19,738
That is not subordination.

1162
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:21,076
Are you crazy?

1163
01:25:21,182 --> 01:25:22,547
Superiors will be watching us

1164
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:25,676
-Let them watch.
-Arif, listen to me. Don't do.

1165
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:26,685
What is going to do for Abdullah?

1166
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:28,551
You get off!

1167
01:25:29,657 --> 01:25:31,090
Why am l? l will..

1168
01:25:31,192 --> 01:25:33,626
Don't you come, silently?
Get in!

1169
01:25:34,863 --> 01:25:36,160
Will they leave you to go?

1170
01:25:36,264 --> 01:25:38,164
Didn't l tell that the phone will come?
Get in!

1171
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,103
You are committing mistake.

1172
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:44,238
-What did you say? -l told you
that you are committing mistake.

1173
01:25:44,339 --> 01:25:45,499
Didn't you hear?

1174
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:49,435
-l enjoy doing the wrong.
-Leave me

1175
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:51,034
-Or you will suffer for it.
-You..

1176
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:53,580
-Come, will you?
-What are you thinking? Start it.

1177
01:26:00,088 --> 01:26:01,112
See, phone is ringing.

1178
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:03,523
-What? -See,
where is it ringing.

1179
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:05,115
-lt is in front side!
-Search it! -See!

1180
01:26:05,226 --> 01:26:06,124
Arif

1181
01:26:06,628 --> 01:26:08,118
-What?
-Phone ringing sound!

1182
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:09,797
May be in the jeep.

1183
01:26:09,898 --> 01:26:12,594
He may call to give instruction.
Let's go

1184
01:26:13,902 --> 01:26:15,199
Take it, fast!

1185
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:17,464
Leave me, l have to go!

1186
01:26:17,572 --> 01:26:20,939
-lnayathulla, don't go
-Damn it, come on.

1187
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:56,644
Hello, tell me where you
have planted the bombs!

1188
01:26:56,744 --> 01:26:59,645
First you call Arif.

-Something unexpected has happened
-What?

1193
01:27:10,692 --> 01:27:13,525
His plan was not to release
the terrorists. To kill.

1194
01:27:13,628 --> 01:27:14,856
There was a bomb in the jeep.

1195
01:27:14,963 --> 01:27:16,453
When the jeep started,
it was blasted

1196
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:17,588
All the three are dead

1197
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:19,394
You mean 4 persons

1198
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:20,398

Put the phone in speaker mode.

1206
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:43,555
Let Abdulla also hear.

1207
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:47,617
l want to release all that
four from this world

1208
01:27:47,795 --> 01:27:50,161
But that work is not over yet.
Mr.Arif!

1209
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:53,093
You have to finish that now itself

1210
01:27:53,201 --> 01:27:55,226
Sorry, we can't understand

1211
01:27:55,336 --> 01:27:59,966
Mr. Marar if a cockroach from
your toilet enters the kitchen..

1212
01:28:00,074 --> 01:28:01,632
..will you nurture it?

1213
01:28:01,743 --> 01:28:03,904
Or hit with the broom and
throw it away?

1214
01:28:04,012 --> 01:28:05,570
l did that job only.

1215
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:07,045
l am cleaning my home

1216
01:28:07,148 --> 01:28:07,978
Who are you?

1217
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:10,710
With original name, pet name,
common name, family name

1218
01:28:10,818 --> 01:28:13,378
Why are you asking the bio data,
Mr. Commissioner?

1219
01:28:13,888 --> 01:28:16,721
You know me.
Met me so many times

1220
01:28:17,425 --> 01:28:19,655
There is a queue in front
of the ration shop..

1221
01:28:19,761 --> 01:28:21,251
..to purchase the very old rice
and kerosene

1222
01:28:21,362 --> 01:28:24,058
l may be the last person
standing in that queue.

1223
01:28:24,165 --> 01:28:28,795
You point out a person in the markets,
mosques, temples, streets.

1224
01:28:28,903 --> 01:28:30,200
l might be that person

1225
01:28:31,172 --> 01:28:34,266
Wherever a train burned,
broke a building, a politician died

1226
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:35,933
My life will go first.

1227
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:38,069
They will burn me with
petrol in middle of a street.

1228
01:28:38,246 --> 01:28:42,205
One will come to your police station
to request, to save his life and properties

1229
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:44,547
You will treat him like a criminal.

1230
01:28:44,919 --> 01:28:46,750
Do you remember?
That was me.

1231
01:28:46,854 --> 01:28:50,221
l am the common man
who you think as a wastrel.

1232
01:28:51,192 --> 01:28:54,753
l am just a stupid
common man of this republic.

1233
01:28:55,063 --> 01:29:00,228
Why a common man became a superman
and purchased 6 kilos of RDX?

1234
01:29:01,135 --> 01:29:03,433
Do you think that
l am a superman?

1235
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:05,765
l think l am an invisible man.

1236
01:29:05,873 --> 01:29:07,841
Because my name is erased
from the voter list.

1237
01:29:07,942 --> 01:29:11,503
When l go to enquire about it, they ask me
to believe that l don't exist.

1238
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:13,307
How can l believe that?

1239
01:29:13,748 --> 01:29:15,113
So, Mr.Commissioner..

1240
01:29:15,216 --> 01:29:17,844
To purchase RDX bomb,
there is no need of a superman

1241
01:29:17,952 --> 01:29:21,319
An invisible man like me is enough.

1242
01:29:21,422 --> 01:29:23,515
Go to the internet and search the bomb

1243
01:29:23,624 --> 01:29:25,990
100 websites will show
how to make a bomb.

1244
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:29,188
So don't ask me how.
Ask me why.

1245
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:30,262
Leave it.

1246
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:32,265
Now one more insect is left.
Shoot it.

1247
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:33,994
l will take it as 4 men are dead.

1248
01:29:34,102 --> 01:29:36,070
Why only these four?

1249
01:29:36,237 --> 01:29:38,728
There are so many terrorists in lndia.

1250
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,205
What are you going to do with them?

1251
01:29:40,308 --> 01:29:43,277
l just gambled. Only these
four names came first.

1252
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:45,141
lf we didn't kill Abdhulla,
will you tell me..

1253
01:29:45,246 --> 01:29:48,272
..you will kill thousands
of innocent people?

1254
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:51,477
You can't prevent the death of
that thousand innocent people.

1255
01:29:51,586 --> 01:29:55,215
lf you release him, he'll kill millions.
l ask only one life.

1256
01:29:55,323 --> 01:29:56,756
But he is asking the life
of million people.

1257
01:29:56,858 --> 01:29:59,622
Compare the both.
lt's a good trade of. Kill him

1258
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:01,752
-Who are you?
-You will not..

1259
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:04,361
When hijack the plane
to Kandahar or Afghanistan,

1260
01:30:04,465 --> 01:30:05,955
..you should have shot him dead.

1261
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:08,695
But you didn't do that.
Sent off giving money in bags.

1262
01:30:08,803 --> 01:30:12,364
Again returned and attacked
the parliament. His heirs in 26/1 1

1263
01:30:12,473 --> 01:30:17,103
Returned and attacked the
railway station and hotel.

1264
01:30:18,212 --> 01:30:20,112
We cried for a few days.
Then forgot it

1265
01:30:20,214 --> 01:30:22,512
A bomb was blast in Meenambakkam,
Chennai in the past,

1266
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:24,244
How many people do remember that?

1267
01:30:24,352 --> 01:30:25,319
We have forgot it

1268
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:27,110
Do we forgive or not..

1269
01:30:27,221 --> 01:30:28,313
We are forgetting.

1270
01:30:28,756 --> 01:30:31,316
Forgetting is a national disease.

1271
01:30:31,759 --> 01:30:34,523
Showing the gun, he is asking
that what you can do.

1272
01:30:34,629 --> 01:30:37,792
lf there is an immediate punishment,
will they do these crimes and shooting?

1273
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:40,925
You expect instant justice like
two minutes noodles.

1274
01:30:41,035 --> 01:30:42,263
Do you think it is practical?

1275
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:45,737
Why not? Terrorism is instant.

1276
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,740
Why should not justice be so.

1277
01:30:47,842 --> 01:30:48,740
Who are you?

1278
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:52,875
-l can't understand?
-You killed Muslim terrorists.

1279
01:30:53,047 --> 01:30:54,275
So are you a Hindu?

1280
01:30:55,249 --> 01:30:57,945
Karamchand is a Hindu, arms dealer.

1281
01:30:58,052 --> 01:31:00,145
l killed him.
So am l a Muslim?

1282
01:31:00,388 --> 01:31:02,618
You go on play the Hindu Muslim

1283
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:05,953
ln the national TV our
west door cried a lot.

1284
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:07,288
And said enough..

1285
01:31:07,395 --> 01:31:09,158
When ask to come to vote..

1286
01:31:09,263 --> 01:31:12,892
Don't join me with the group

1287
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,298
..that will not show even their finger
for the 43% democracy.

1288
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:17,638
l will clearly tell who l am.

1289
01:31:17,839 --> 01:31:19,670
A terrorist killing the terrorists.

1290
01:31:19,774 --> 01:31:22,004
Answer me straight.

1291
01:31:22,109 --> 01:31:24,942
Who are you?
Hindu or Muslim?

1292
01:31:25,046 --> 01:31:26,604
May not be a Christian?

1293
01:31:27,048 --> 01:31:29,812
Buddhist? Communist, Atheist.

1294
01:31:29,917 --> 01:31:31,077
Don't they get angry?

1295
01:31:31,185 --> 01:31:34,814
Still you didn't tell, we knew
many things about you.

1296
01:31:34,922 --> 01:31:38,289
Style, dressing, gestures,
your left handed character

1297
01:31:38,392 --> 01:31:41,225
Oh.. you know everything.

1298
01:31:41,796 --> 01:31:44,162
Leave it, what do you know
about Mahatma Gandhi?

1299
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:46,425
You don't deserve
to tell his name.

1300
01:31:46,534 --> 01:31:49,230
Do you have?
Who else has it?

1301
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:51,362
Gandhi used to write with both
the hands, you know?

1302
01:31:51,472 --> 01:31:52,905
He was ambidextrous!

1303
01:31:53,007 --> 01:31:55,168
Unfortunately l am his fan too.

1304
01:31:55,276 --> 01:31:57,574
l also have no difference in writing,
even use right or left hand.

1305
01:31:57,745 --> 01:32:00,441
-But it is for writing only.
-Ambidextrous?

1306
01:32:00,548 --> 01:32:01,776
Acutely scared.

1307
01:32:01,883 --> 01:32:05,114
Do you fear that you will be killed
if caught by the police

1308
01:32:05,753 --> 01:32:06,651
May be

1309
01:32:06,821 --> 01:32:08,721
Yes or no.
Tell the answer in binary.

1310
01:32:08,823 --> 01:32:10,723
You fear, isn't?

1311
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:17,456
-Yes l fear!
-Always that fear should be in your mind.

1312
01:32:17,565 --> 01:32:19,590
What you want to prove
will not succeed.

1313
01:32:20,468 --> 01:32:21,867
Succeeded.

1314
01:32:21,969 --> 01:32:25,200
To make you roam like this,
only four weeks were needed.

1315
01:32:25,306 --> 01:32:27,866
For this common man
with this common intelligence.

1316
01:32:27,975 --> 01:32:30,944
Do you think that they are more
intelligent than me?

1317
01:32:31,112 --> 01:32:35,811
Planting the bomb, they can threaten
our political power and business center.

1318
01:32:35,917 --> 01:32:37,475
Why should we bother about it?

1319
01:32:37,585 --> 01:32:39,746
We are from different places.
We are in Tamil Nadu.

1320
01:32:40,121 --> 01:32:43,887
lf a bomb blast in Mumbai, we will
not show it even in the Tamil channel.

1321
01:32:43,991 --> 01:32:46,551
lf happened to us, it is a disaster.
lf happened to them, it is news.

1322
01:32:46,661 --> 01:32:49,152
Our Tamil Nadu is a peaceful garden.

1323
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:51,230
They are using other languages

1324
01:32:51,465 --> 01:32:53,433
lf a knife cuts the heart in Mumbai,
why should we bother.

1325
01:32:53,534 --> 01:32:57,095
We are safe by standing in Kanyakumari.
We think like that.

1326
01:32:57,204 --> 01:32:59,104
Now he asks by pointing
the gun on the head.

1327
01:32:59,206 --> 01:33:00,764
Asking that what you are going to do?

1328
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:04,504
100 men asking 100 crores of men.
As what the hell you are going to do.

1329
01:33:04,612 --> 01:33:05,510
Nobody replied.

1330
01:33:06,314 --> 01:33:07,747
Now l am replying.

1331
01:33:07,848 --> 01:33:09,008
That you can't bear. lsn't?

1332
01:33:09,116 --> 01:33:10,606
Explosion, bomb blast.

1333
01:33:10,718 --> 01:33:12,208
You are telling again and
again about it, why?

1334
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:16,154
Did anyone from your family
or friends die of bomb attack?

1335
01:33:23,864 --> 01:33:25,024
Ok.

1336
01:33:26,801 --> 01:33:28,234
Since you asked,

1337
01:33:30,338 --> 01:33:31,635
l will tell a story.

1338
01:33:32,006 --> 01:33:33,303
Only a short story.

1339
01:33:35,543 --> 01:33:38,103
Only one daughter, Mr. Marar.

1340
01:33:39,213 --> 01:33:40,703
Four months carrying.

1341
01:33:42,483 --> 01:33:45,111
Came home to stay with her parents.

1342
01:33:45,219 --> 01:33:48,245
North lndia. Winter season

1343
01:33:49,423 --> 01:33:53,985
One day night, chased her in
the middle of the market..

1344
01:33:54,095 --> 01:33:56,461
..in the shivering cold.

1345
01:33:58,165 --> 01:34:03,193
They tied her hands back as she should not
pray God seeking the help.

1346
01:34:04,839 --> 01:34:07,672
When she fell down on the road..

1347
01:34:09,043 --> 01:34:11,273
On her body.. On her body..

1348
01:34:11,379 --> 01:34:16,078
They removed all her dress
as there was not a bit on her body.

1349
01:34:17,251 --> 01:34:18,741
Crowd all around

1350
01:34:19,253 --> 01:34:21,687
l didn't know how many Ramakrishnans,
Lal krishnans,..

1351
01:34:21,789 --> 01:34:24,223
..Radhakrishnans were in that crowd.

1352
01:34:24,992 --> 01:34:27,290
Even one of that krishnans
didn't come to help her.

1353
01:34:28,996 --> 01:34:30,486
At that time, the mere at last
of that girl..

1354
01:34:35,403 --> 01:34:37,564
We are adults Mr.Marar.

1355
01:34:38,339 --> 01:34:41,240
You policemen might have seen a lot.

1356
01:34:41,876 --> 01:34:43,104
l am telling openly.

1357
01:34:45,079 --> 01:34:49,573
They put the hand inside
her female organ..

1358
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:52,710
..and aborted her Mr. Marar

1359
01:34:56,090 --> 01:34:57,250
Abortion.

1360
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:01,322
When l knew the meaning
of that word, she..

1361
01:35:01,429 --> 01:35:03,260
..and her child were no more.

1362
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:10,398
To cry, to shed tears, to get angry..

1363
01:35:10,504 --> 01:35:12,404
..should she be my daughter?

1364
01:35:14,108 --> 01:35:17,737
lf she was a daughter of my brother,

1365
01:35:17,912 --> 01:35:20,278
My friend,

1366
01:35:21,382 --> 01:35:23,213
A Muslim..

1367
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:27,081
..shouldn't l shed tears?

1368
01:35:27,655 --> 01:35:30,283
Ah.. what is the justice?

1369
01:35:32,526 --> 01:35:33,823
Jaihind..

1370
01:35:35,463 --> 01:35:38,626
You asked my name. lsn't?
l will tell..

1371
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:43,634
One Karamchand died
in the bomb blat just now,

1372
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:45,433
let it be my name.

1373
01:35:45,539 --> 01:35:47,632
What answer you
have to tell this Karamchand?

1374
01:35:47,808 --> 01:35:52,507
You go out of your office
One Karamchand will be in the junction

1375
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,507
What the answer you will tell him?

1376
01:35:55,483 --> 01:35:57,644
Don't know. l will tell.

1377
01:35:58,085 --> 01:36:02,454
Terrorism is the only weapon
to destroy the terrorism.

1378
01:36:02,556 --> 01:36:05,719
That l told today.
Fakr hai muje

1379
01:36:06,627 --> 01:36:09,061
l can't understand you

1380
01:36:09,497 --> 01:36:13,729
Do you find my logic hard to digest?

1381
01:36:14,168 --> 01:36:18,867
-May be! -Yes or no answer
in binary Mr. Commissioner

1382
01:36:19,974 --> 01:36:21,407
-Yes
-Good!

1383
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:27,137
lf they kill 300 or 400 people,
you will keep quiet.

1384
01:36:27,248 --> 01:36:28,545
As the court would answer.

1385
01:36:28,649 --> 01:36:31,140
lf l kill four among them,
you are shouting like this.

1386
01:36:31,252 --> 01:36:35,211
Why the common human rights for them
when it is not for the common man.

1387
01:36:36,257 --> 01:36:38,088
Ok.. l don't blame you.

1388
01:36:38,192 --> 01:36:43,095
You have designed a figure that
a common man should be like this,..

1389
01:36:43,197 --> 01:36:47,759
even you know that l am a common man,
you raised your voice.

1390
01:36:47,868 --> 01:36:52,168
You think that l am just joking
and easy to catch.. Don't you think?

1391
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:54,633
-l will not think like that
-Good!

1392
01:36:54,742 --> 01:36:55,834
Happy to know that.

1393
01:36:55,943 --> 01:36:59,242
Because, all the bombs
l set are ready to blast.

1394
01:37:00,681 --> 01:37:02,114
Mr. Arif

1395
01:37:02,683 --> 01:37:06,050
Whether it is my last call or not,
You have to decide.

1396
01:37:07,888 --> 01:37:11,119
Do you want me to wait
on the line, or disconnect?

1397
01:37:11,225 --> 01:37:13,716
No no.. Don't disconnect

1398
01:37:14,295 --> 01:37:15,455
What you want me to do?

1399
01:37:16,163 --> 01:37:20,862
Ok. That TV girl and cameraman will come
there in 10 minutes.

1400
01:37:20,968 --> 01:37:24,267
An ambulance should come with them.
A doctor would be in it.

1401
01:37:24,371 --> 01:37:26,601
Doctor should check the heartbeat
of Abdhulla..

1402
01:37:26,707 --> 01:37:29,073
..and confirm his death
through the channel.

1403
01:37:29,176 --> 01:37:31,007
You see the picture and tell the story.

1404
01:37:31,645 --> 01:37:33,476
l will tell you where the bombs are.

1405
01:37:34,515 --> 01:37:37,211
Arif, l will call you back

1406
01:37:37,318 --> 01:37:38,148
Ok sir

1407
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:43,547
Arif, he is a cheater, Kafir

1408
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:45,689
He didn't know anything.

1409
01:37:46,193 --> 01:37:48,627
This is about our religion brother.

1410
01:37:49,396 --> 01:37:53,560
We are chasing America
in lraq and Afghanistan

1411
01:37:53,667 --> 01:37:55,430
like that we should stand united.

1412
01:37:55,536 --> 01:37:57,504
Nobody can do anything.

1413
01:37:57,872 --> 01:37:59,362
Abdhulla you did a mistake.

1414
01:37:59,607 --> 01:38:01,575
Why you didn't stay
in Afghanistan?

1415
01:38:01,675 --> 01:38:02,972
Why you came to lndia?

1416
01:38:03,277 --> 01:38:06,178
The anger of a common man.

1417
01:38:06,347 --> 01:38:07,371
See what happened.

1418
01:38:07,481 --> 01:38:08,971
You also might be killed

1419
01:38:09,149 --> 01:38:12,585
A jihad warrior like me
will not have fear of death.

1420
01:38:13,153 --> 01:38:15,644
l am ready to do any sacrifice.

1421
01:38:16,557 --> 01:38:20,186
For jihad and for my religion..

1422
01:38:22,429 --> 01:38:23,657
Why are you laughing?

1423
01:38:23,964 --> 01:38:26,933
l know that!
You fear for death

1424
01:38:29,303 --> 01:38:31,464
-Yeah! -We will decide it later.
-You are right.

1425
01:38:34,041 --> 01:38:37,204
-Hello!
-Ms. Natasha where are you?

1426
01:38:37,311 --> 01:38:38,403
Outside the airport

1427
01:38:38,512 --> 01:38:39,410
Good.

1428
01:38:39,513 --> 01:38:41,003
Go near the air strip.

1429
01:38:41,248 --> 01:38:43,614
Headlines is waiting for you

1430
01:38:43,784 --> 01:38:45,411
Ok!
Let's go!

1431
01:38:46,854 --> 01:38:48,219
Mr. Marar,

1432
01:38:48,923 --> 01:38:50,754
Everything gone
beyond our limit.

1433
01:38:51,325 --> 01:38:52,952
-Now?
-Do you want to call the CM?

1434
01:38:53,060 --> 01:38:55,153
Yes, serious matters
He has to decide.

1435
01:38:55,262 --> 01:38:58,891
You can't decide that this matter
should go to CM or not

1436
01:38:58,999 --> 01:39:00,023
What do you mean?

1437
01:39:00,134 --> 01:39:01,965
You have given me the ultimate authority

1438
01:39:02,069 --> 01:39:03,001
Not governance

1439
01:39:03,103 --> 01:39:06,004
Limited powers as dictated by democracy

1440
01:39:06,106 --> 01:39:08,472
-Dictated by democracy?
-Yes! -That's nice!

1441
01:39:08,575 --> 01:39:11,874
Why do you talk like a politician?
l have no time to listen!

1442
01:39:11,979 --> 01:39:14,812
So, are you going to act directly?

1443
01:39:14,915 --> 01:39:16,610
-Yes!
-There will be consequences Mr. Marar!

1444
01:39:16,717 --> 01:39:17,615
l have thought well

1445
01:39:17,718 --> 01:39:18,685
lf it missed?

1446
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:20,549
My head will be sacked. Okay

1447
01:39:20,654 --> 01:39:21,678
lt's going to be your funeral.

1448
01:39:21,789 --> 01:39:23,222
You are invited with pleasure

1449
01:39:23,324 --> 01:39:25,952
No l am not interested to participate

1450
01:39:26,393 --> 01:39:28,418
Even though l never like this
from the beginning.

1451
01:39:28,529 --> 01:39:30,019
Mutual feelings madam

1452
01:39:30,130 --> 01:39:32,621
See, she forgot the cell.

1453
01:39:32,733 --> 01:39:33,961
Go and give her.

1454
01:39:34,068 --> 01:39:36,696
Clean it with napkin and give.
She wants to keep her hands clean

1455
01:39:36,804 --> 01:39:38,101
Clean hand

1456
01:39:38,739 --> 01:39:42,106
Mr. Marar.
l respect you now.

1457
01:39:42,476 --> 01:39:43,636
Mutual madam.

1458
01:39:50,684 --> 01:39:52,242
-Arif
-Sir

1459
01:39:55,089 --> 01:39:56,056
Head

1460
01:39:57,091 --> 01:39:57,989
Yes sir!

1461
01:40:04,832 --> 01:40:05,992
No, Arif!

1462
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:07,599
Leave me, Arif!

1463
01:40:23,117 --> 01:40:24,482
Why you didn't tell before

1464
01:40:24,585 --> 01:40:26,553
Sorry! lt is Commissioner's order.

1465
01:40:26,653 --> 01:40:27,620
Look there.

1466
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:34,752
What happened?

1467
01:40:34,928 --> 01:40:36,555
l don't know sir.
Program got crashed

1468
01:40:36,663 --> 01:40:38,358
You mean you can't find?

1469
01:40:38,465 --> 01:40:40,023
You told he is not a genius!

1470
01:40:40,667 --> 01:40:42,828
He is a great man than l expected.

1471
01:40:42,936 --> 01:40:44,426
lt is very important than to be a genius

1472
01:40:44,538 --> 01:40:45,436
So what are you?

1473
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:48,167
Nothing.. one among 100 crores

1474
01:40:59,219 --> 01:41:01,187
-Sir!
-Excuse me, sir!

1475
01:41:02,089 --> 01:41:04,057
l don't know whether he is it or not, sir

1476
01:41:04,491 --> 01:41:07,858
What are the resemblances between
this photo and the person you saw

1477
01:41:07,961 --> 01:41:10,657
Sir.. l misspelled in tension.

1478
01:41:11,031 --> 01:41:13,192
l couldn't remember that he had beard.

1479
01:41:14,168 --> 01:41:15,601
He will not be like this.

1480
01:41:15,969 --> 01:41:17,937
-Between this and him..
-6 differences..

1481
01:41:18,839 --> 01:41:21,000
60.. 600 differences..

1482
01:41:21,108 --> 01:41:23,076
All you say. . . won't you not?

1483
01:41:24,178 --> 01:41:27,409
Yes sir.. No sir.. Sorry sir!

1484
01:41:52,873 --> 01:41:56,365
When the terrorists try to escape,
the police severely fought with them..

1485
01:41:56,477 --> 01:41:59,640
..and one inspector got injured severely.

1486
01:41:59,746 --> 01:42:01,441
His name is Arif khan.

1487
01:42:01,548 --> 01:42:03,846
Here, the doctors are
giving treatment to him.

1488
01:42:03,951 --> 01:42:06,442
Mr. Sethuraman is with us.

1489
01:42:06,553 --> 01:42:08,714
Let's listen what he says.. Sir

1490
01:42:08,822 --> 01:42:09,914
For the security reason

1491
01:42:10,023 --> 01:42:12,651
We used to shift the terrorists from
one place to another for security reason.

1492
01:42:12,759 --> 01:42:16,320
Like that, when we shifted today,
Arif Khan was shot at.

1493
01:42:16,430 --> 01:42:18,864
We retaliated for that. That's all.

1494
01:42:19,833 --> 01:42:20,731
Thank you

1495
01:42:20,901 --> 01:42:23,927
This old air strip has become
a hot news today.

1496
01:42:24,037 --> 01:42:28,201
4 terrorists brought here by the police
with protection tried to escape..

1497
01:42:28,308 --> 01:42:30,139
..and shot by the police.

1498
01:42:30,244 --> 01:42:32,075
Why they've been brought here?

1499
01:42:32,179 --> 01:42:34,147
Where have they planned to go from here?

1500
01:42:34,248 --> 01:42:36,614
How the terrorists tried to escape?

1501
01:42:36,717 --> 01:42:40,153
As usual the police keep silent
for these questions.

1502
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:24,728
Hello

1503
01:43:25,098 --> 01:43:26,190
Mr. Marar

1504
01:43:26,366 --> 01:43:27,333
Tell me

1505
01:43:28,368 --> 01:43:30,461
l didn't plant any bomb anywhere else.

1506
01:43:30,771 --> 01:43:31,931
lt's all just empty bag.

1507
01:43:32,039 --> 01:43:33,267
l guess so

1508
01:43:34,775 --> 01:43:36,675
Nice.. Knowing you

Excuse me

1511

What's the time now?
My watch has stopped.

Excuse me

1515
01:46:08,829 --> 01:46:09,727
Ah.. tell me dear

1516
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:11,058
Didn't you start yet?

1517
01:46:11,231 --> 01:46:13,392
Ah.. l am starting
Anybody came to talk

1518
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:14,660

-l don't know.. May be

1520
01:46:17,104 --> 01:46:20,267
-l've bought tomato, nuts, spices
everything. -Come fast.

1521
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:22,808
l am on the way.
You disconnect the phone

1522
01:46:29,249 --> 01:46:30,614

1523
01:46:31,385 --> 01:46:34,752
Can't give up the tomato.
Thank you.

1524
01:46:34,988 --> 01:46:36,421
Did you ask something?

1525
01:46:36,523 --> 01:46:39,754
l told that this bag weigh heavy.

1526
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:43,626
lf you can't carry it,
l can drop you.

1527
01:46:43,730 --> 01:46:45,027
No.. No need! Here..

1528
01:46:46,867 --> 01:46:48,027
lt seems like a police vehicle

1529
01:46:48,135 --> 01:46:49,363
Yes.. Are you coming?

1530
01:46:49,469 --> 01:46:51,096
No, my house is nearby

1531
01:46:51,204 --> 01:46:52,228
Don't you need?

1532
01:46:55,075 --> 01:46:57,771
lrinjalakkuda Govindhan Raghava Marar.

1533
01:46:58,211 --> 01:47:00,042
Commissioner of police

1534
01:47:07,888 --> 01:47:09,719
He told his name.

1535
01:47:10,490 --> 01:47:12,117
What is in a name?

1536
01:47:12,826 --> 01:47:15,124
Let him be a common man!

1537
01:47:15,829 --> 01:47:17,592
A poor guy!

1538
01:47:17,898 --> 01:47:21,061
He had boldness, courage,

1539
01:47:21,168 --> 01:47:24,137
annoyance, moral anger..

1540
01:47:24,438 --> 01:47:25,803
Hats off to him!

1541
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:29,208
That case has not been
registered anywhere.

1542
01:47:29,976 --> 01:47:32,877
The terrorists tried to escape.

1543
01:47:32,979 --> 01:47:34,207
So, what do you do?

1544
01:47:34,381 --> 01:47:37,282
Shoot them down and
sack the commissioner.

1545
01:47:38,185 --> 01:47:41,814
Don't know if it is right or wrong
whatever happened.

1546
01:47:42,055 --> 01:47:46,151
One thing is sure!
Whatever has to happen has happened.
