1
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,164
Where
are you going?

2
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,499
Mogadishu.

3
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,128
Why your visa is cancelled?

4
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,255
My mother, she's sick.

5
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,760
What's in your pocket?

6
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,057
Show me what's in your pocket.

7
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,719
I wonder what it smells like.

8
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,928
Who cares? Hurry up.

9
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,140
They must have put
it up yesterday.

10
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,642
Just tick your
boxes and let's go!

11
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,898
Bulb's out.

12
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,608
What? Where?

13
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,611
Top left.

14
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,613
The day shift will fix it.

15
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,990
I can't leave her
looking like that.

16
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,957
- So, are you happy now?
- Yes

17
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,210
Easy, dhakkan!

18
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,133
I'm borrowing this.

19
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,138
I bet it smells like jasmine.

20
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,641
If you don't shut up,
I'll give you another smell to think about.

21
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,730
So, what are you doing today?

22
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,567
I'm moving to a new house.

23
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,860
You need help with your things?

24
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,236
What things?

25
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,375
How many times have I told you about
the rules of safety in this company?

26
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,169
Sir, please. It wasn't my fault.

27
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,795
Whose fault was it then?

28
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,214
- It was one of the other guys.
- This is what you always say.

29
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,300
Sir, please - just
give me another chance.

30
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,302
Three warnings in three months!

31
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,388
Sorry, I cannot accept that.

32
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,223
- Just give me another chance.
- Take your settlement.

33
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,600
Sir, please.

34
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,644
Hand in all your belongings.

35
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,979
And get out.

36
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,235
30 days.

37
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,320
Huh? What?

38
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,863
Terminated.

39
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,907
Jobless.

40
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,118
30 days to piss off
back to his own country.

41
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,922
I'll just go sign off and
I'll see you at the truck.

42
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,442
You don't look at your hands?

43
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,194
What?

44
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,779
When you type. You don't
look at your hands?

45
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,785
What happened to Salim?

46
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,122
Vacation?

47
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,875
Permanent. Vacation.

48
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,545
What about his billboards?

49
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,298
Can you handle them?

50
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,134
I love my job.

51
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,927
Is that what I asked you?

52
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,815
This is perfect.

53
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,153
Stick with this for now.
I might add more later.

54
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,614
I'd look like a million
dollars wearing this suit.

55
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,838
Hello.

56
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,245
Indian?

57
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,706
I'm Caweys.

58
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,983
Aaden?

59
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,830
Jimmy isn't here.

60
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:10,873
Who?

61
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,626
- Jimmy.
- Who's that?

62
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,252
The guy that isn't here.

63
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,200
Hello.

64
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,703
I'm looking
for Mr. Jimmish.

65
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,625
I saw him come up.
Does he live here?

66
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,546
Jimmish?

67
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,422
That sounds like a sneeze.

68
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,007
A sneeze?

69
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,219
How appropriate.

70
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,723
I'm afraid what Mr. Jimmish
has is quite contagious.

71
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,901
My name's Darbaan. My number.

72
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,738
Where are you from?

73
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,242
Mogadishu.

74
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,912
Bless you.

75
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,795
Mmm.

76
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,756
Don't touch my things.

77
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,758
At the door. You're
a good talker, man.

78
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,802
I like it.

79
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,681
- What do you do?
- Advertising.

80
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,516
Advertising?

81
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,727
I'm in finance.

82
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:57,438
So the guy, he's
your accountant?

83
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,273
No, he's an investor. But the
market's down, you know?

84
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,610
And you live in this palace?

85
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,903
No, brother.

86
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,280
I just come here to take a shit.

87
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,289
The only way you'll get any of
that stuff is if you steal it.

88
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,290
I'm not a thief.

89
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,833
No.

90
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,295
But you are a dreamer.

91
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,131
All good thieves are dreamers.

92
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,315
Saving up for my daughter's
dowry will be the death of me.

93
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,859
Never have girls!

94
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,696
- You married a girl right?
- Yeah, so?

95
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,658
What did you get for your dowry?

96
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,995
I got two buffaloes.
And a motorcycle.

97
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,914
And I sold one buffalo
to come to Dubai.

98
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,918
You still have
the other buffalo?

99
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,046
Yes, I was just talking to her.

100
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,014
Gandu, are you back
to your dreamland?

101
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,143
One day I'm gonna
wear that watch.

102
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,711
Sir...

103
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,254
Hi Caweys.

104
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,217
I want to work in sales.

105
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,970
I can do it.

106
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,222
I work hard. I'm dedicated.

107
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,725
I love working here.

108
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,894
I'm a people person.

109
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,313
You know all my sales team
have Bachelor's degrees?

110
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,984
Master's, even?

111
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,902
And you haven't even
finished school.

112
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,240
Nobody in this city will offer you a
better job if you haven't finished school.

113
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,244
So this is all I'm worth?

114
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,930
Hey, Dreamer.

115
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,266
My name is Caweys.

116
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:51,945
Hey you - you going to your
perfume billboard tonight?

117
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,158
- Mmhmm.
- I got something for you.

118
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,203
Here.

119
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,752
Hey don't open it
until you get there.

120
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,925
Hey, are these yours?

121
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,718
No.

122
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,854
It's fine.

123
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,857
It's fine.

124
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:19,158
Listen, all this stuff?
They're just things.

125
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:24,496
- Not for us to own.
- I don't want to own them.

126
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,834
- I just want to know what it's
like. -What what's like?

127
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,752
What it's like to have things.

128
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,049
- You finish school?
- Yeah.

129
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,221
Well I didn't.

130
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,558
You might be happy
where you are.

131
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,020
But this is all I'm
ever going to be.

132
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,523
I came here with nothing.

133
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,903
- And I'm going to be leaving with nothing.
-What you have, my friend, is not nothing.

134
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,219
- You know that happens
automatically, right? -Huh?

135
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,891
Come on. Let's go.

136
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,059
Where?

137
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,894
Out.

138
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,730
- Out where?
- Come on!

139
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,123
Hey, one from your billboards,
yeah? You wanna try?

140
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,043
It looks expensive.

141
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,212
Expensive? Hi, could I please...

142
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,131
...have a taste of this
Natural Strawberry?

143
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,759
- Of course.

144
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,763
This guy has to give us
as many tastes as we want.

145
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,724
Until we make up our minds.

146
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,435
- Right?
- Yeah.

147
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,733
Can I please have
the Pralines & Cream?

148
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,277
Good choice, my favorite.

149
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:48,301
Something for you then?

150
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,055
Nah mate. I'm
lactose intolerant.

151
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:47,694
Oh, that's the one, huh?

152
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,113
Let's go check it out.

153
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,741
No?

154
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,204
Suit yourself.

155
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,900
- Guess how much it is.
- How much?

156
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,945
460,000.

157
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,955
- It's easy, you know?
- What?

158
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,958
To take the watch.

159
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,128
Yeah.

160
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,088
They make demo models.

161
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,757
All we gotta do is
get our hands on one.

162
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,010
Mmhmm.

163
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,848
Then what you do is, you
go into the store, right?

164
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,641
You pretend you're buying.

165
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,976
- Yeah?
- Right, right.

166
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,812
You...

167
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,650
You distract the
sales agent. Right?

168
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,320
- It's so big.
- Yeah!

169
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,157
Make the switch - the demo
for the real thing - and then:

170
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:02,162
You just fucking walk
out the front door.

171
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,664
Hey, how
much is the demo?

172
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,626
- How much you got?
- Huh?

173
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,133
Nah man. You can't afford it.

174
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,642
How'd you do that?

175
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,187
I'm serious man.

176
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:38,800
- Caweys?
- Hi!

177
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,552
Um, can I speak to
you for a second?

178
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:51,938
I spoke to Ayman.

179
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,941
Oh.

180
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,777
Sorry about the sales job.

181
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,613
It's okay. Hospital bills
going up, that's all.

182
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,241
Hospital bills?

183
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,034
Um. Mother.

184
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,123
No wife.

185
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,964
Thank you.

186
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,651
You know what real
money looks like?

187
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,156
That guy.

188
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,121
You know what's
in his bag? Cash.

189
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,379
We could do it.

190
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,173
Do what?

191
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,509
- Take it.
- Take it?

192
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,637
Take it.

193
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:09,766
These guys carry anywhere between 50,000 to 90,000 dirhams.

194
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,937
Fifty-fifty.

195
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,358
- That's tempting.
- Yeah. It is.

196
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,863
I'm not like that.

197
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:27,700
Honest day's work.
Honest day's wage.

198
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,079
Good luck.

199
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,172
Hello beautiful.

200
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,051
- You need to get a woman.

201
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,762
- I already found a woman.
- Huh?

202
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,641
And she can type without
looking at her hands.

203
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,896
I can also do something
without looking at my hands.

204
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,941
Okay, okay.

205
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,610
I don't wanna know.

206
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,199
Hey what's your day rate?

207
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,789
Like how much money
do you make in a day?

208
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,170
You make what? 1,500 a month?

209
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,756
1,800.

210
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,675
1,800.

211
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:31,806
So that's... 70
dirhams a day. Yeah?

212
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,737
You're worth more
than that, aren't you?

213
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,656
Apparently not.

214
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,251
That's my wallet!

215
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,963
300?

216
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,176
What'll I get for 300?

217
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,637
That's my money.

218
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:11,804
I like that one.

219
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,147
Let me get my wallet!

220
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,321
Hey Ramu.

221
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,323
Jimmy.

222
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,743
- No box. No charger?
- No man.

223
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,829
- 200.
- 200?

224
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,999
This is a new model.
This is dual sim. 600.

225
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,835
- 250.
- 550.

226
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,671
- 300.
- 300 is good.

227
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:47,924
- Who's the guy?
- Intern.

228
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,676
500.

229
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,260
- 400.
- 450.

230
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,054
- Jimmy. 400.

231
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,310
400.

232
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,355
Hey hey hey. Watch it.

233
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,691
- Hey, Ramu.
- Hmm?

234
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,859
When you wash your face,
where do you stop?

235
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,486
Here right at the back.

236
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,078
Here's your money, man.

237
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,211
That's almost two days
of your life. Two days.

238
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,548
Being poor isn't up to you, man.

239
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,053
Staying poor is a choice.

240
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,023
Hello?

241
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,945
Hey. Hi. My friend, he lost
his sunglasses somewhere.

242
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,201
Where did you lose them?

243
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:05,788
- Um
- He must have dropped them around somewhere in the mall.

244
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,790
The security, they
told us to come here.

245
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,667
Yeah, Lost and Found.

246
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,507
- What kind of sunglasses?
- Aviators. Right? Yeah.

247
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,888
What color?

248
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:22,930
Silver.

249
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:39,280
Sorry, they're not here.

250
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,115
What? But they told us...

251
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,909
- The frame is silver.

252
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,332
Ma'am. Black lenses.
Silver frame.

253
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,251
- Yeah. What he said.
Black lenses. Silver frame.

254
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,843
- Try them on.
- Really?

255
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,762
Yeah.

256
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:22,323
Hey! You
look good, man.

257
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:25,117
Thanks. I like it.

258
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:35,503
Nah. You keep them.
They're yours.

259
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,965
- But they're somebody else's.
- No, you earned them man.

260
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,553
If you don't know how
to take care of what you have...

261
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,264
Then you don't deserve it.

262
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,648
There's so much stuff
just lying around.

263
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,942
All you have to
do is pick it up.

264
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,754
What the fuck are you doing man?

265
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:19,964
Nothing.

266
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,012
Shall we get the
fuck out of here?

267
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,566
Hey. One more off the list.

268
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,068
What's left? What do we got?

269
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,906
- The car.
- The car. Yeah.

270
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,034
Yeah man, the car.

271
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,828
They didn't let me drive though.

272
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,874
I don't have a license, so
they didn't let me drive.

273
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:56,917
They didn't let you?

274
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,221
They
didn't let me drive.

275
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,850
Stupid mother fucker.

276
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:50,554
Hey, you. Who are you?

277
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,599
I'm the new guy.

278
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:01,065
Go get that car. Park in the basement.
Bring the keys with the tag, give them to me.

279
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,650
Okay!

280
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,111
Welcome to the W Hotel.

281
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,906
Welcome to the W Hotel.

282
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,118
Here's your card.

283
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,733
What the hell were
you thinking, Caweys?

284
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,151
They fired me.

285
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,902
- Of course you got fired.

286
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,904
You're lucky you're not in jail.

287
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,909
- I can't get another job here.
- So go home.

288
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,663
Take care of your mother.

289
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,344
With what money?

290
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,512
You'll find a job back home.

291
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:03,349
Not one that pays enough.

292
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:08,854
Caweys.
30 days here is more expensive than 30 days back home.

293
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,525
Don't stay here and get
yourself into more trouble.

294
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,696
You have the potential
to be so much more.

295
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,870
Go home.

296
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,014
So what are you gonna do, man?

297
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,766
I don't even have a job.

298
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,435
Who's talking about a job, man?

299
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,604
You got 30 days.

300
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,773
You can take whatever you want.
You can do whatever you want.

301
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,777
Look what that got me.

302
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:37,748
- I can't even pay my bills.
- What bills?

303
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,137
What bills, man?

304
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,021
Hey...

305
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,315
My mom's medical bills...

306
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,153
I send money to her every month.

307
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,742
And now I'm short 600.

308
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:21,625
600?

309
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,630
I messed up, man.

310
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,347
Done.

311
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,182
- What do you mean?
- Done.

312
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,186
Come on.

313
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,850
Time to go.

314
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,312
Is that enough?

315
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:09,941
I don't think so man.

316
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:13,945
Caweys.

317
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:29,122
Shh!

318
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:30,957
Relax. It's no problem.

319
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,252
Let's get out of here man.

320
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:39,925
You're the boss.

321
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,218
2,825.

322
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,307
Thank you, man.

323
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:23,963
- Relax, Mr. Jimmish.

324
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,096
You'll get your money.

325
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:43,108
I'm going to make this
very simple for you.

326
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:51,282
I'm out of town for
the next three days.

327
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:53,618
I will be leaving your
passport with Mr. Anwar.

328
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:58,039
He will be expecting your call.

329
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,792
And the money.

330
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:08,967
Call him. Before I get back.

331
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:13,680
If not, then I assure you...

332
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:16,641
The next time I see you
will be the last time.

333
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,979
Where you going?

334
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:05,273
Somewhere those assholes
can't find me.

335
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,567
How much you owe them?

336
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,697
65,000.

337
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,829
I can't pay them back and
I can't leave until I do.

338
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,711
They have my passport, man.

339
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,929
I need your help, man.

340
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:45,897
I need your help.

341
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:57,575
You remember that guy, on
the bike? With the bag?

342
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,703
He's gonna be here tomorrow.

343
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:05,750
He's gonna have to park
his bike somewhere here.

344
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,087
And then...

345
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:12,840
He's gonna walk from shop
to shop... To shop to shop.

346
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,178
- And then walk all the way back.
- So?

347
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:20,098
That's the only
way to pay Darbaan.

348
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:25,228
- Rob him?
- Yeah.

349
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,437
Come on, man.

350
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:33,236
- You know I'm not gonna do that.
- You saw what that guy did to me today.

351
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:36,114
If I don't pay, I'm done.

352
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,792
Look.

353
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:51,921
He has to come to
all of these shops.

354
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:53,965
It's money off-the-books.

355
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:57,135
Nobody can report it stolen.

356
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,971
Nobody will come after us.
It's ours for the taking.

357
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,981
Your mother needs how much?
Per month?

358
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,567
- 1,100.
- 1,100.

359
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:19,574
There's at least 80,000 dirhams
in that bag.

360
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,329
You can have half.

361
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,875
That is three years
of hospital bills.

362
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:54,984
How are we gonna do it?

363
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,697
If I could do it I would
have done it already.

364
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:04,035
I will be right here though,
man. I'll be right here.

365
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,244
I'll be parked right
there in the car.

366
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,247
If anything goes
down, I'll jump in.

367
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,042
You'll need this.

368
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,212
- I'm not gonna hurt him.
- No, it's not for him.

369
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,632
You slide it under the strap.

370
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,801
You slide it under the strap,
you cut it loose,

371
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,889
pull the bag, you run!

372
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:29,227
- He's gonna chase me!
-How fast are you willing to run for 40,000 dirhams?

373
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:36,567
It just don't feel right, man.

374
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:47,912
Please.

375
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:25,825
I'm not gonna hurt him.

376
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,953
- Hey, hey!

377
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:23,628
- Leave him alone!

378
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:28,275
Late night flight available,
1,270 dirhams.

379
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:29,527
Nothing before that?

380
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,864
Book it.

381
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,497
- Tomorrow is cheaper.
- Tonight.

382
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:08,774
Hello?

383
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:34,545
- They're not here for you.

384
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:38,716
Not yet.

385
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,888
He's probably not even dead.

386
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:47,725
Hey, don't you want your cut?

387
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:52,605
From the heist?

388
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,690
How much?

389
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,900
460.

390
01:09:58,068 --> 01:09:59,737
Thousand.

391
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,240
He didn't have that much.

392
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:13,751
It's not the real thing.

393
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:15,586
Not yet.

394
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:18,589
- I'm going home, man.
- So am I.

395
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:20,049
But not empty-handed.

396
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:21,258
Wait.

397
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:34,772
You paid Darbaan?

398
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,660
I need your help man.

399
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:07,054
You gonna walk out
the front door?

400
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:11,684
One call from me and you
will never see your home again.

401
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:29,827
So.

402
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:38,252
You're going to walk that watch into the store
and you're going to walk the real thing out.

403
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:56,145
- What makes you think they're going to leave
me alone with that watch even for a second?

404
01:11:56,186 --> 01:11:58,105
- Looking like that, they won't.

405
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:03,902
Another one from your list.

406
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:08,240
You're welcome.

407
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:11,035
It's easy.

408
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:14,538
Walk in. Make the
switch. Walk out.

409
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,250
Then meet me at the
fountain at 10:00.

410
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,254
Then you're free.

411
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,181
You just walked in, made
the switch, walked out?

412
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:02,993
I like you, Caweys.

413
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:09,583
Oh...

414
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:16,840
What now?

415
01:17:21,678 --> 01:17:23,472
Run.

416
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:38,213
Take it.

417
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:44,261
Here.

418
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:00,277
Man.

419
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:22,168
Your day rate has
definitely gone up.

420
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:26,256
Give me the watch.

421
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:29,551
Take it.

422
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:31,011
Give me the watch!

423
01:22:05,045 --> 01:22:06,755
Hello?

424
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:24,814
The guy might still be in the building.
We got robbed. Half a--

425
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:35,659
I know what the guy looks like.

426
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:37,160
If I go right now--

427
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:17,260
Let's go.

428
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:27,413
Where
are you going?

429
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:28,790
Mogadishu.

430
01:25:32,585 --> 01:25:33,962
Why your
visa is cancelled?

431
01:25:34,003 --> 01:25:35,171
My mother, she's sick.

432
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:41,177
What's
in your pocket?

433
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:46,141
Show me what's in your pocket.

434
01:26:24,053 --> 01:26:25,889
- Have a safe flight.
- Thank you.

435
01:26:48,119 --> 01:26:49,245
Oh fuck.

436
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:55,752
Hello, Mr. Jimmish.

437
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:26,115
Hello, welcome.

438
01:27:26,157 --> 01:27:27,951
Hi.

439
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:29,577
Mr. Caweys, welcome aboard.

440
01:27:31,287 --> 01:27:33,081
This will be your seat.

441
01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:34,582
Thank you.

442
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:05,655
- Hi, I'm Neeraj.
- Caweys.

443
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,991
Going home?

444
01:28:08,032 --> 01:28:09,826
Yes.

445
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:11,619
- Vacation?

446
01:28:13,162 --> 01:28:14,664
Permanent vacation.

447
01:28:16,207 --> 01:28:17,917
You didn't like it here?

448
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:26,592
I liked it too much.

449
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:32,515
All passengers and cabin crew should now be
seated with their seatbelts securely fastened.
