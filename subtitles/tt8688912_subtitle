Shit! Shit! Shit!

3
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,920
What are you doing, man?
What’s with the forehand?

4
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,800
One more…

5
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,080
What the hell, man!
That’s such a rough follow through, idiot!

6
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,880
Not one ball is going across.
And you call yourself a Federer fan?

7
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,440
Is there no pressure in the balls?

8
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,360
Play properly.

9
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,680
Focus, damn it!

10
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,320
You see that guy so frustrated…

11
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That’s me.

Arjun…

13
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,040
I am Salman’s fan and
Lord Hanuman’s devotee.

14
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,400
Hey.

15
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Get ready.

16
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,920
It’s coming.

17
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,680
Oh, Lord… Brainwash him somehow

18
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,920
and make sure he gets married
this year.

19
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,160
Does she realize it’s Lord Hanuman?

20
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,080
Hanuman, mom visits whichever temple
she pleases.

21
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,360
But I'm not like her.

22
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,680
I am a loyal devotee.

23
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,480
I only visit your temple.

24
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,480
Pay heed to me and brainwash
my mommy.

25
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,200
Make sure she doesn’t mention marriage
for another 5 years.

26
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,280
If I remain a lifelong bachelor
like Salman and Lord Hanuman…

27
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,760
Wouldn’t it be great?

28
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,360
There’d no pressures or commitments.

29
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,520
I can lead a happy life
with no complications.

30
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,640
But you won’t be spared.

31
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,280
No one leaves you in peace.

Good morning, dad…

33
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,680
Good morning, Arjun…

34
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,720
Arjun.

35
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,120
Go ahead, dad.

36
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,200
Arjun, why don’t you get married?

37
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,080
Dad, tell me this.

38
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,360
Why’d you get married?

39
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,960
I was 26 years old back then.

40
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,840
I saw your mom's pictures...

41
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,400
She was quite hot.

42
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,600
I immediately said yes.

43
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,480
Luckily, your mom also said yes
and we got married.

44
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,480
- Right?
- Yeah.

45
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,760
You wouldn’t find a sweeter
person than mom.

46
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,360
And that is why you married her.
- Obviously.

47
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,600
I should also find such
a girl for me, right?

48
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,400
I’ll get married when I do.

49
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,800
We’ll find one for you.

50
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,920
No need.

51
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,560
Even if I do find such a girl…

52
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,000
I’ll definitely not get married
for another 5 years.

53
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,360
End of topic!

54
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,520
What were you thinking?

55
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,080
Only mom and dad will put
pressure on this topic.

56
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,520
Every damn person around me does it.

57
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,360
Every single one tortures me.

58
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,000
Including friends…

59
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,760
Whoa!

60
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,920
What’s with your karma?

61
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Take a look.

62
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,040
You see at least 3 girls in every gang.

63
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,920
Some of them are here with
their girlfriends and wives.

64
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,360
But you are shameless,
having Saturday night beer with me.

65
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,400
I am boozing with you only.

66
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,960
Is that a problem too?

67
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,160
Damn right, it is.

68
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,120
Wouldn’t it be great if there were a girl
in our gang?

69
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
You don’t notice that.

70
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,520
What do you want me to do now?

71
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,400
Get married.

72
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,360
Get married.

73
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,840
I’ll have a sister-in-law if you get married.

74
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,520
She’ll be my best friend.

75
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,360
There are a few things…
I mean personal stuff…

76
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,440
I can’t share them with you.

77
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,600
You wouldn’t get it even if I did.

78
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,600
I’ll share everything with
my sister-in-law.

79
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,800
It would be awesome.

80
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,040
You want a girl in our gang,
is that it?

81
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,720
Why don’t you get married then?

82
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,880
My parents brought this up
four years back.

83
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,080
I said it’s too early for me
to get married.

84
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,000
When I go ask them now…

85
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,720
They say, ‘Aren’t you too old
to get married?’

86
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,640
Who can I share this with?
You, of course.

87
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,800
Since I turned 25,

88
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,600
wherever I go and whomever I meet…

89
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,240
This is the only question they pose.

90
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,280
When are you getting married?

00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,520

I know.

113
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,640
I knew it when you woke up late.

114
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,320
You’d skip breakfast saying
you’ve got no time.

115
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,320
That’s why I made you a sandwich.

116
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,360
Have it in the car.

What is it, mom?

120
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,680
I have something important to discuss.

121
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,640
Tell me.

122
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,160
Umm… You go to work.
I’ll tell you on the phone.

What’s the matter? Tell me right now.

How long do we settle for the naughty glances and smiles?

We never spoke since I joined this office but…

133
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,600
Our eyes converse at least once in the lift.

00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,000
Give me 2 days’ time.
I’ll think about it and let you know.

184
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,600
You rascal!

185
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,360
Harassing me via email… You pimp!

186
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,720
‘Kilikili’ language from ‘Baahubali’? Seriously?

187
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,720
You scoundrel!

188
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,120
That was a good line though.

189
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,880
I’ll kill you, damn it!
I’ll roast you alive.

190
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,680
You think you deserve a book?

191
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,360
Guys like you are the reasons
girls don’t step out at nights.

192
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,760
Constitution demands for a change.

193
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,160
Country calls for a revolution.
What do you think of yourself?

194
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,720
I’m not your type of guy, you idiot!

195
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,960
If you are so desperate,
go sigh at guys in a park.

196
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,840
I’ll smack you down, you maniac!

197
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,080
If one more person asks about the email…
- What email?

198
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,160
Oh, it’s you!

199
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,480
Boss asked for you twice. Go meet him.

200
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,920
Okay, I’ll check my mails and go.

201
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,920
Why do you have to do that now?
Meet the boss first.

202
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,000
- Hey, I’ve got important stuff to check.
- Meet the boss first.

203
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,280
Email, what the hell!

204
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,560
Ma’am…

205
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,800
Yeah, come, Arjun.

206
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,480
Arjun, do something.

207
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,600
You don’t have to come to work tomorrow.

208
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,680
Come to the client’s office directly.

209
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,000
Sure.

210
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,320
We have the meeting at 10.

211
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,160
[PHONE BUZZING]

212
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,400
No surprises in the content during
the presentation.

213
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,240
No… No…

214
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,120
The presentation better be bloody good, Arjun.

215
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,080
I’ll just switch it off.

216
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,280
Okay.

217
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,080
Start right away, Arjun.

218
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,120
And please don’t delay it.
- Ya, ma’am.

219
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,200
What happened?

220
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,280
[PHONE BUZZING]

221
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,680
What the hell!

222
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,640
She calls right after I switch on
my phone.

223
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,960
What happened?

224
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,320
Mom has something important to discuss.

225
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,080
She called twice while I was
with the boss.

226
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,360
I very well know what the important
matter is.

227
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,600
I can’t talk here.
I’ll go to the cafeteria.

228
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,800
It’s usually empty at this hour.
- That’s best. Go…

229
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,400
Dear, are you free?

230
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,440
Can I talk to you for 5 minutes?

231
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,160
Hmm…

232
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,160
Umm… I have good news for you.

233
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,200
Hear it out calmly.

234
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,160
Don’t worry or panic.

235
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,720
Why do you sound doubtful
when it’s good news?

236
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,600
You tell me the matter.
I shall decide the reaction.

237
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,080
It’s nothing, dear.

238
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,400
I arranged an alliance this evening.

239
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,880
You just come meet the girl and leave.

240
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I knew it! I knew it, mom!

241
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,200
I am not coming.

242
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,240
Why won’t you come?

243
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,160
I can’t get a better girl
for an idiot like you.

244
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,840
You’ll know only if you come meet her.

245
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,960
You’ve put me through this hell
twice already.

246
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,840
You say the same thing every time.

247
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,960
Last two alliances were the worst
experiences of my life.

248
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,360
We go to a stranger’s house
where 20 people stare at me.

249
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,400
A girl enters suddenly and offers coffee.

250
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,040
Both of us are asked to go talk
on the terrace.

251
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,120
As we have a small talk and come down…

252
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,120
You ask if I’ll marry her and
stay together forever.

253
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,080
What can I say?

254
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,680
How can one decide like that?

255
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,120
Have you lost your mind?
It’s such a worst procedure.

256
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,280
All guys say the same things now.

257
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,240
But once you turn 45,

258
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,640
you’d curse me.

259
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,760
You’d want me to convince you
at the right age.

260
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,960
You’d feel all alone

261
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,640
thinking what you’d do without me.

262
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,160
You don’t have to worry.

263
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,440
No matter how worse my condition is,
I’ll not come to you.

264
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,520
And I didn’t say I’d never get married.

265
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,280
I said I’d do it after 5 years.

266
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,560
You’ll turn 32 in 5 years.

267
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,160
At that age, your arranged marriage
market shrinks.

268
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,840
Number of options will come down.

269
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,920
Dear...

270
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,320
You’ve no idea what’s correct in life.

271
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,880
You’re a confused idiot.

272
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,560
But I know very well.

273
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,400
The girl I found this time...

274
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,880
Is perfect for you.

275
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,560
Your life will be settled.

276
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,520
Mom, even if you get me Rakul Preet,
I’ll say no.

277
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,760
Hey, this over confidence
isn’t good for you.

278
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,680
You don’t know this girl.

279
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,520
I bet 10,000 bucks on it.

280
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,720
Within 10 minutes of meeting this girl…

281
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,320
You’d come to me shamelessly

282
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,520
And say you’re desperate about her.

283
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,120
I bet, mom. I’ll reject her within 5 minutes.

284
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,160
I bet on it.

285
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,880
I bet on it too, mom.

286
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,280
- Bye!
- Bye!

287
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,400
So, have I agreed for the alliance?

288
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,360
Let’s go to the terrace.
I need to smoke.

289
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,240
Okay, I’ll get a plate of samosas.
You want some?

290
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,000
No, thanks.

291
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,800
You shouldn’t grab from my plate later.

292
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,240
Hey, I don’t want any.

293
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:51,960
Okay then.

294
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,880
Hello, sir…

295
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,480
A plate of small samosas…

296
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,320
Only corn samosas, huh?
Don’t you have the curry ones?

297
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,000
Okay. Add it to his account.
- Okay, sir.

298
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,880
Senseless people, man!

299
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,840
Do we have to get married
just because they did?

300
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,640
She says this girl is really good.

301
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,200
I’ll not find a better one.

302
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,840
I will definitely say yes.

303
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,760
My foot!

304
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,000
Dude...

305
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,440
Tell me something.

306
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,960
You’re around 27 years old.

307
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,960
You got promoted last year.

308
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,760
You have a good salary now.

309
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,800
Luxurious life,

310
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,560
right?

311
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,720
But...

312
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,920
I know how boring your life is.

313
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,960
Been 6 years since your break up

314
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,160
right?

315
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,680
You don’t have a girlfriend since then.

316
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,920
I doubt you’ll ever find one.

317
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
What’s your problem then?

318
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,960
Why don’t you get married?

319
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,160
Are you out of your mind?

320
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,600
What’s gotten into you?

321
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,800
If I get married because my life is boring…

322
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,280
There can’t be a worse reason
in the world.

323
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,560
I can go to the movies, shop
or party if I am bored.

324
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,120
I can’t get married and trouble myself.

325
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,840
Don’t ever fix something
that is not broken.

326
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,800
I have a few goals in life.

327
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,520
My wish list…

328
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,480
I’ll accomplish everything and then
think about marriage.

329
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:31,920
Goals…

330
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,800
Tell me.

331
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,160
Give me your goals list.

332
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,360
My biggest dream in life…

333
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,680
You know, right?

334
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,480
I have to buy a high-end sports car.

335
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,240
I worked hard to save 12 lakhs already.

336
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,760
8 more lakhs…

337
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,480
I’ll take a loan for the down payment.

338
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,240
Okay, so…

339
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,480
If I am married…

340
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,360
So what?

341
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,320
My wife might agree.

342
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,080
But both our families would say crap like…

343
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,280
‘Hey, you are married now.
You’re a family man now.’

344
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,240
‘You should act responsible, right?’

345
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,760
‘Why don’t you invest the money
in gold or insurance?’

346
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,680
‘It’ll help your kids’ higher education.’

347
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,960
This is your goal. Okay.

348
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,440
What’s the next goal?

349
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,520
I’ve to go on a trip to Europe
once in my life.

350
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,960
I want to explore a
the whole of Europe for a month.

351
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,440
Enjoy it.

352
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,360
I want to go alone.

353
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,880
If I get married and go to Europe…

354
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,680
I’d be the biggest fool ever.

355
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,720
Have you ever seen the Spanish
and Italian girls in Europe?

356
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,640
You should keep your options open, man.

357
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,200
Hey… Hey… Hey…

358
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,320
Lose your classiness and try being sensible.

359
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,000
Do you know how the situation

00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Anjali, I am really sorry.
I didn't do this on purpose.

542
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,960
I don't know what to say
when you over react.

543
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,080
Over react?

544
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,920
You think it's my hobby to get all decked up
to impress you?

545
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,720
I am killing my self-respect to do this.

546
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,400
My fate!

547
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,560
My situation is such.

548
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,840
What do I tell....

549
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,320
What do I tell mom now?

550
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,000
I wonder if she'll hurt herself.

551
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,520
Get me more water.

552
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,960
Yeah, sure.

553
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,280
Anjali...

554
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,400
It seems you like pineapple juice.

555
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,520
Anjali, don't mind. But alliances
are all about yes or no.

556
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,240
It's common, right?

557
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,600
And I can't be more decent in saying no.

558
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,800
Correct. What can you do?

559
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,760
I also agreed to the marriage
due to family pressure.

560
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,600
I am sorry I didn't mean to over react.

561
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,880
And I am used to boys rejecting me.

562
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,600
So, it's fine.

563
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,400
How come?

564
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,120
You seem like a sensibly intelligent girl.

565
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,880
And you're beautiful.

566
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,120
Who would say no to you?
- Oh...

567
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,920
What did you just do?

568
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,920
I mean...

569
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,440
Relax, Arjun. I'm just kidding.

570
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,120
Anjali...

571
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,440
You talk about your situation...

572
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,160
And your mother hurting herself.

573
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,320
What's the problem?

574
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,800
Are you also from Anakapalli?

575
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,080
Very good. Very good.

576
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,200
I heard your daughter got distinction
in degree.

577
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,680
Oh...

578
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,960
We're really happy.

579
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,600
You've raised her well.

580
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,080
It's our fortune to have her
as our daughter-in-law.

581
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,600
Harish will meet Anjali as soon as
he's back from the States.

582
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,520
But you can consider
the alliance fixed.

583
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,720
Not just Harish... No guy would say no
to your daughter.

584
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,480
That's great. I'm really happy.

585
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,160
What else can we ask for?

586
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,680
We can have the engagement
once Harish is back.

587
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,040
Brother would be really happy
if he knows.

588
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,880
He'd excited about my daughter's wedding.

589
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,720
He'd look after all the arrangements.

590
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,840
We've to get the wedding cards printed
and the date fixed.

591
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,600
Mom... Mom...

592
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,160
He'd ask for the invitees list.

593
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,840
I don't know what to tell him.
- Sit. Sit mom.

594
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
We didn't attend Raghu brother's wedding.

595
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,080
- Mom... Calm down...
- No, I need to make a list.

596
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,200
Where's the damn pen?

597
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,080
Mom... Sit down.
- No. Why don't you understand?

598
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,040
Tell me the number of wedding cards
you need.

599
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,560
I'll mention it in the list.

600
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,560
I've to find out how many wedding cards
are required.

601
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,920
Get up... Get up...

602
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,880
Why are you made to sit here?

603
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,840
Relatives will be arriving.
What? You think I don't know?

604
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,280
The house is all dusty.

605
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,560
Mom...

606
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,840
Don't stop me.
- Wait on...

607
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,520
Mom, give that to me.

608
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,280
Mom...

609
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,000
Uncle, don't be scared.

610
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,760
Mom is bipolar.

611
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:52,120
When she is too excited or depressed,
these episodes occur.

612
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,200
We are providing her treatment.
So, don't worry.

613
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,520
Oh, take care of her, dear.

614
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,680
We'll call once Harish is back.
Okay, dear?

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,760
Sister, your phone...

Is it them?

618
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,000
- Hmm...
- Let me talk.

619
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,840
I've to apologize.
- It's okay.

620
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,800
Hello...

621
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,840
Yes, uncle. Tell me.

622
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,920
Dear...

623
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,840
We really like you.

624
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,760
You are a gem.

625
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,080
But the thing is,
we like another girl equally.

626
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,320
If I had to rate you two,

627
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,840
I'd rate both of you 9 out of 10.

628
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,800
But, there are no complications
in their family.

629
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,960
And your mom has a few issues
in your family.

630
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,840
And you don't have a father or brothers.

631
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,040
If Harish becomes your husband...

632
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,040
He has to bear your mother's
medical expenses.

633
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,440
So, we acted a little practical and
finalized the other alliance.

634
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,320
You don't mind. Please don't mind.

635
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,200
Uncle, select any girl you want to.
I have no problem.

636
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,080
To be true, I don't even want to get married.

637
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,800
I agreed just to keep my mom happy.

638
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,800
But, know this.

639
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,240
I very well know how to look after
my mom and family.

640
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,720
No matter whom I marry in the future...
He doesn't have to come help me.

641
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,320
I'm not waiting for a guy to save us.

642
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,680
I'll take care.

643
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,680
Wish your son a very happy married life.

It's a good alliance, brother.

647
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,120
At least this time...

648
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,040
Anjali...

649
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,080
Let's do one thing.

650
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,720
Next time they come,
I'll take mom outside.

651
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,480
Why, uncle? That's not necessary.

652
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,440
I just need a guy who understands mom
and is affectionate towards her.

653
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,120
Otherwise, I'll never be truly happy.

654
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,560
I'll only tell them the truth.
- Have you gone mad?

655
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,200
You're right.

656
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,920
Take me outside.

657
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,800
This alliance can't be ruined
because of me.

658
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,680
They just have to understand you.

659
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,440
Mom, no...

660
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,960
Take me outside.

Where have you pursued your degree?

662
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,240
Here in Hyderabad...

663
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,720
Okay then.

664
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,560
It's been a pleasure meeting you, Anjali.

665
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,440
Hope we have a great life together.

666
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,200
Okay then. God bless you.

667
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,000
Let us know when mom is back
from Bangalore.

668
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,760
We'll talk about the proceedings.
- Okay.

669
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,840
Yeah.

670
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,280
We'll leave. - Okay, uncle.

671
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,800
Okay, auntie.

00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,320
Hey, Rajiv... What happened?
You like Anjali?

673
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,480
The girl's a gem.

674
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,240
We should thank you for getting
such an alliance.

675
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,360
Ah, thank god! I knew you'd like her.

676
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,640
Anjali is a gem.

677
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,640
You are just great.
This is just a perfect match.

678
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,280
You know the last alliance Anjali got rejected
because of her mom's issue.

679
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,680
I felt really bad.

But I know you're really broadminded.

681
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,320
That is why I got this alliance for you.

00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,200

Yeah, uncle. She's back.

In fact, she's right beside me.

A marriage is not an affair
of two entities.

It's a bond between two families.

00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,840
My happiness lies in
looking after you.

720
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,040
I've got a job now. I will be paid well.

721
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,880
I want to do many things for you three.

722
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,040
Let's buy a Tata Nano car.

723
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,680
Let's shift into a good flat.

724
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,200
Let's stay happy together.

725
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,600
Is life all about marriage?

726
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:31,880
No, right?

727
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,360
Mom...

728
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,960
Mom...! Mom...!

729
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,440
Anu...! Anu...!

730
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,800
Mom... Mom...

731
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,000
Go down.

732
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,560
Mom… Please…

733
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,160
Go down. Mom...

734
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,160
Mom, please...

735
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,640
No matter what I tell mom now,

736
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,480
She wouldn’t believe me.

737
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,360
She’d assume she’s the reason this
alliance didn’t work out.

738
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,480
I wonder how mom will react.

739
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,400
I am sorry...

740
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,800
I am quite angry with my mom and dad.

741
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,160
I've told them no several times.

742
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,640
You'll watch this in the news tomorrow.

743
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,160
'A man kills his own parents.'

744
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,520
So sorry, Anjali.

745
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,360
You are nothing.

746
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,120
Some candidates were worse.

747
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:18,360
A guy said he wants
a tall beauty like Anushka.

748
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,440
One more guy wanted
a milky beauty like Tamanna.

749
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,800
These guys were fine.

750
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,520
There was one more pervert.
He was the worst.

751
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,840
As soon as I stepped out,

752
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,600
He didn't even greet me.

753
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,760
But he gazed at me
from top to bottom.

754
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,120
He later asked me to show
my profile.

755
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,560
He saw me long enough and said...

756
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:53,520
‘Everything is fine. But her teeth
and pimples drive me off.’

757
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,480
Are we washing machines
to check the features and buy?

758
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,560
On top of that, we have to give the dowry.

759
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,400
Every guy wants Katrina Kaif.

760
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,440
But none of them look like Ranbir.

761
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,040
They broke up.

762
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,160
Catch my point, Arjun.

763
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,680
But give me that pervert's
name and address.

764
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,480
I'll kill him.

765
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,640
Oh,

766
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,920
you'd kill him and go to jail for me.

767
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,360
But you wouldn’t marry me.

768
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,800
Am I right?

769
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,160
Anjali...

770
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,280
Arjun, I am kidding.

771
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,800
Relax.

772
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,760
You're a nice guy.

773
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,840
Give me 5 minutes, Arjun.

774
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,320
I'll decide on what to tell mom and leave.

775
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,320
Yeah, sure.

776
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,000
If you don't mind, can I go to your balcony?

777
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,480
I need to catch some fresh air.
- Yeah, sure. Please come.

778
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,160
So, Arjun, how'd you end up
in the arranged marriage market?

779
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,040
Don't you have a girlfriend?

780
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,560
We broke up 6 years back.

781
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,480
I've been single since then.

782
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,000
And Hyderabad guys have a logic.

783
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,000
There are two kinds of girls in Hyderabad.

784
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,680
Either single or interesting...

785
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,320
But never both.

786
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,640
Oh...

787
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,840
So, how’d you fall into the
arranged marriage market?

788
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,040
Don’t you have a boyfriend?
- Me?

789
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,000
I am the really boring type, Arjun.

790
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,800
I am the first bencher
who writes notes all day.

791
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,200
I'd go home as soon as the bell rings.

792
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,320
I'd have a lot of work at home.

793
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,040
Classmates would call me auntie.

794
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,360
So, I never had a boyfriend.

795
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,160
Never?

796
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,280
I am far better.

797
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,640
We girls have a logic too.

798
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,120
Do you know what the handsome guys
in Hyderabad are called?

799
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,680
What do you call them?
- Tourists...

800
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,760
Hello…
- Oh, please...

801
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,440
Okay, Arjun. I’ll leave.
It's already late.

802
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,400
Mom must be tensed.

803
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,560
As I go tell them the alliance isn't fixed...

804
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,280
They'd ask what I did for so long.

805
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,760
Okay, Anjali. And I’m saying this sincerely.
Your mom will be fine.

806
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,520
You'll also find a really nice guy.

807
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,720
Oh... But you will not say yes, right?

808
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,720
I am joking, Arjun.
You are a such a fool, you know.

809
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,160
I am also telling you sincerely.

810
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,760
You're very sweet.

811
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,240
Whenever you decide to get married...

812
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,760
You'll surely find a great girl.

813
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,280
Okay, bye.
- Oh, you called me home to insult me.

814
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:36,120
And you want a hug now?
No way. A hand shake is enough.

815
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,040
We are not that close either.

816
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,400
I want mom.

817
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,000
Okay, Arjun.

818
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,880
Are you kidding me?

819
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,520
What do you mean?
- Are you leaving?

820
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,440
What else do you want me to do?

821
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,200
I came here for an alliance.

822
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,520
You saw me and said no.

823
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,240
I am going home.

824
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,120
What else do I have to do?

825
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,120
Hey, no! I felt a connection.

826
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,200
Didn't you feel anything?

827
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,560
So what?

828
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,920
So what, huh? I don't know.

829
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,200
We should get to know each other, right?

830
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,920
Let me take you out on a date. Please...

831
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,600
Lunch or dinner?

832
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,200
How come you sound so immatured, Arjun?

833
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,000
I have to go home and say yes or no.

834
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,880
If it's a yes, we've to be
together for a lifetime.

835
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,280
If it's a no, this will be the end of things.

836
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,280
I’ll go meet another guy in the
next couple of days.

837
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,600
If that alliance is fixed,
I’d have to live with him for life.

838
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,360
You know my situation and
still act like this.

839
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,200
You talk about a date
and getting to know each other.

840
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,640
Anjali, this is not fair.

841
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,920
I can't decide if I want to marry you in a day.

842
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,720
I want to get to know you.

843
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,600
That option doesn't exist.

844
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,800
Marriage or goodbye...

845
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,600
Anjali, wait...

00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,000
Ugh!

848
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,440
Fine. Let's get married.

849
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,320
Let's get married.

850
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,120
You're such a confused candidate, Arjun.

851
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,320
Just 10 minutes ago, you said...

852
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,480
“I have some goals. I’ve to buy a car
and go on a trip to Europe.’

853
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,560
You said you won't get married
for another 5 years.

854
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,640
And now you say, 'Let's get married'.

855
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,360
Tomorrow morning, you’d be like…

856
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:50,080
‘Oh, shit! What did I just do?
I made a mistake.’

857
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:54,280
You’d be confused again saying
we’ll cancel the marriage.

858
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,800
If I go home and tell them you said no...

859
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,840
There's a chance my mom
might be alive.

860
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,200
But if you say yes and cancel later...

861
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,440
Even if you want this marriage, I do not.

862
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:23,520
I can't weep marrying a confused
candidate like you.

863
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,880

864

- Mom had another episode.

He left just now, Sir.
In fact, you can catch him if you go.

You can catch him if you go now.
You can definitely get him.

01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,600
Shall we ask them for a ride?

1245
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,920
Not at all. I don’t want to see them
ever again.

1246
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,360
I’ll manage Arjun.

1247
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:31,800
Anjali.

1248
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,040
Anjali! Are you sure?
How will you manage?

1249
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:38,440
I’ll be fine if the bleeding stops.

1250
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:42,840
Let’s do this.

1251
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,760
Let me pick you up.

1252
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:46,120
Arjun!

1253
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:51,600
Are you OK?

1254
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:12,840
Are you OK?
- Hmmm.

1255
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:19,120
What happened, Anjali? Are you OK?
- What?

1256
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,960
Do you need some rest?
- No! I am fine.

1257
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:24,440
No. You look tired.

1258
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:31,160
Take rest…
Check it once.

1259
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:49,480
“This might be the first desire of my heart
that is clueless”

1260
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:54,080
“This moment of happiness brings a smile”

1261
01:28:54,920 --> 01:29:00,040
“This conversation goes on
like a cool breeze”

1262
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:05,440
“It is so good even though
it doesn’t stay forever”

1263
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:10,920
“Something has happened to my heart
and I’m clueless”

1264
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:15,200
“This moment of happiness
brings a smile”

1265
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:21,480
“This conversation goes on
like a cool breeze”

1266
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:27,000
“It is so good even though
it doesn’t stay forever”

1267
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:33,000
“Slowly…it brings a smile on my face”

1268
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:35,800
“Slowly…”

1269
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:43,400
“Slowly… new thoughts arise in me”

1270
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:46,440
“Slowly…”

1271
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:53,400
“This might be the first desire of my heart
that is clueless”

1272
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:58,200
“This moment of happiness
brings a smile”

1273
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:04,080
“This conversation goes on
like a cool breeze”

1274
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:10,040
“It is so good even though
it doesn’t stay forever”

1275
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:24,120
“An unknown disturbance is created
in me suddenly”

1276
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:28,920
“I have been driven this way”

1277
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:34,680
“These feelings weren’t there ever before”

1278
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:39,400
“This moment of togetherness
cannot be denied”

1279
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:44,160
“The true affection is to be accepted”

1280
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:52,440
“This might be the first desire of my heart
that is clueless”

1281
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:56,680
“This moment of happiness
brings a smile”

1282
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:03,080
“This conversation goes on
like a cool breeze”

1283
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:07,800
“It is so good even though
it doesn’t stay forever”

1284
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:14,760
“Slowly…it brings a smile on my face”

1285
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,320
“Slowly…”

1286
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:25,440
“Slowly…new thoughts arise in me”

1287
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:28,240
“Slowly…”

1288
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:40,040
Grandma! Is it painful?
Let me get some water.

1289
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:41,280
Hi, Anu.

1290
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:43,240
Hi, grandma.
- Hi, Arjun.

1291
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,920
What is it? Why did you take so long
to get the card?

1292
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:52,760
You guys went to our house
and there’s no one home.

1293
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,720
What happened there?
- No… There’s nothing like that.

1294
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:57,640
It is a long story.

1295
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:59,200
I will tell you later.

1296
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:00,520
Oh, my!

1297
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:02,240
What happened to grandma?

1298
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:03,480
She’s got acidity problem.

1299
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,320
She won’t stay awake for
such a long time.

1300
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:07,480
That is why she got a stomach ache.
- What to do?

1301
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,240
Shall I get something to eat?
- No!

1302
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:11,520
Juice is better than food for
acidity problem.

1303
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:12,480
Is it?

1304
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:13,920
OK. I will go and get it.

1305
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:16,040
Where will you get it from?
I already checked for it.

1306
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:17,760
The hospital’s cafeteria is closed.

1307
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:20,280
We should adjust for today.
We’re are helpless.

1308
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:23,160
OK. I will get it from outside.

1309
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:25,160
It is 2:30 am.

1310
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:27,360
Where can you find juice?

1311
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:29,480
Don’t worry, grandma. I will get it.

1312
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,160
Grandma. Have some water, please. - No.

1313
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:36,280
Leave me.

1314
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:38,040
Have some water...

1315
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:39,080
Grandma

1316
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:40,680
Where is Arjun?
- He left.

1317
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:41,800
What?

1318
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,080
He left…

1319
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:44,880
Please, grandma.

1320
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:45,880
‘Did he leave?’

1321
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:47,160
Grandma! Don’t irritate me.

1322
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:48,960
Please drink.

1323
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:50,360
I don’t want to.

1324
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:51,960
No chance.

1325
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:25,560
What is it?

1326
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:29,600
The doctor said that your mom is fine.
Don’t worry.

1327
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:36,160
Grandma! How did you feel
when grandpa died?

1328
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:44,000
I felt so bad.

1329
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,560
I couldn’t bear it.

1330
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,960
There is something stronger than love.

1331
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:51,880
It is our habit.

1332
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:57,040
I was habituated to live with him
for 48 years.

1333
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:03,560
He’s the only one to love or fight with.

1334
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:08,680
It is hard to stay without such a person.

1335
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:01,320
I don’t want such habit, grandma.

1336
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:07,560
It will be a weakness to emotionally
depend on someone.

1337
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:11,800
I don’t want that weakness.

1338
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:27,720
[DOORBELL RINGING]

1339
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:47,080
Why did you take so long
to open the door?

1340
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:49,560
What the..! It is 11:30 pm now.

1341
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:51,400
It is not 11:30 pm. It is 3:45 am.

1342
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:53,640
3:45 am? Are you out of your mind?

1343
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:55,720
Why did you disturb be at this hour?
- Hey! Leave it.

1344
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:57,320
It is a life and death matter.
There’s a medical emergency.

1345
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:58,680
I need orange juice immediately.

1346
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:00,680
Orange juice?
- Yes.

1347
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:02,880
Why will a bachelor have orange juice
at home?

1348
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:03,760
I got some beer.

1349
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:05,760
I told you that I need orange juice
immediately.

1350
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:06,760
You are free to take the beer.

1351
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:08,880
Hey…That isn’t for me.

1352
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:10,720
I told you that there’s a medical emergency.

1353
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:11,720
I got a beer. You can take it.

1354
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:12,800
Hello.

1355
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,120
They might have it at their house.

1356
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:14,840
They will definitely have.

1357
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:16,520
Hey…They’re your neighbours and you should ask them. Come.

1358
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:17,320
I will not come.
- Hey!

1359
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,360
Hey, Sujith! Come.
- No way.

1360
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:23,920
No, buddy. No!
No, please! Don’t do that.

1361
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:31,840
Baby.

1362
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:33,960
Really?

1363
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:38,120
Hi.

1364
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:40,360
Is it you?
- That’s me.

1365
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:42,560
- Why did you ring the bell at this hour?
- I got some work.

1366
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:44,280
Hello! I didn’t call you baby.

1367
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:45,560
I’ve been waiting for my husband.

1368
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:48,040
He’s coming on an international flight.
Why did you come?

1369
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:48,880
Please…

1370
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:49,800
Please...

1371
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:51,320
It is a medical emergency.
Life and death matter.

1372
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:52,680
I need your help.

1373
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,720
What do you want?

1374
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:56,120
I want oranges.

1375
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:57,800
Orange juice?
- Please.

1376
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,840
It is a life and death matter.
Please try to understand.

1377
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:01,800
OK, wait. I will get it.
- Thank you.

1378
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:08,600
Take this.

1379
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:10,400
Thank you… Thanks a lot.

1380
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:11,560
Please leave.

1381
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:12,600
My husband will come.

1382
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:14,600
It won’t be good if you stay here
when he comes. - Sorry.

1383
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:15,720
Please leave.

1384
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:20,200
What now?

1385
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:22,560
I actually need orange juice.

1386
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:24,480
This is too much.
- It is a medical emergency.

1387
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:26,400
Please…try to understand.

1388
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:29,280
Thank you. God bless you.

1389
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:39,560
Here.

1390
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:41,040
Thank you so much.

1391
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,840
You may leave now.
- Believe me.

1392
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:44,800
I wouldn’t trouble if it wasn’t
a medical emergency.

1393
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:46,800
You helped me at this hour.
That’s so sweet of you.

1394
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:49,000
- Take it.
- I tell you that you’re so adorable.

1395
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:18,920
Baby!

1396
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:25,800
Baby.

1397
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:29,920
Hello, Sir.

1398
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:32,760
She calls you baby, right?
I just found out.

1399
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:33,960
That’s so cute.

1400
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:36,520
By the way, don’t mind, Sir.
It is a medical emergency.

1401
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:38,040
It is a life and death matter.

1402
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:39,480
Tell him, madam.

1403
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:55,800
Never show me your face again.

1404
01:38:57,960 --> 01:38:58,880
Dude.

1405
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:01,960
I am confused.

1406
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,040
It would be nice if you come along.

1407
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:05,560
They’ll say it tomorrow
or day after tomorrow.

1408
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:07,240
Sujith!

1409
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:09,440
Sujith.

1410
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:11,320
Dude.

1411
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:12,080
Wait.

1412
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:13,400
Grandma!

1413
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:14,560
Orange juice.

1414
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:16,360
How did you get it, dear?

1415
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:19,120
I will get anything that you ask.

1416
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:21,440
But, where did you find it?

1417
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:22,640
Where else would it be?

1418
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:24,760
It will available at 5-star hotels
at this hour.

1419
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:27,040
That’s right.

1420
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:28,720
Am I right, Arjun?

1421
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:30,880
Yeah. That’s right.

1422
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:32,480
So sweet.

1423
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:37,640
Just a second.

1424
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:39,680
Come here.

1425
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:43,000
Did you get it from the 5-star hotel?

1426
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:46,400
Did you get it from the 5-star hotel?

1427
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:48,680
It doesn’t matter, dude.

1428
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:49,520
Try to adjust.

1429
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:51,320
I am the one who got screwed.

1430
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:54,760
You said that you got it from a hotel
and they think that you’re great.

1431
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:56,000
Who am I, then?

1432
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:57,520
OK. You are great as well.

1433
01:39:57,960 --> 01:39:58,480
No…

1434
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,280
You can make it favourable to you.
- Dude...

1435
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,840
Can I talk to you for a second?

1436
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:25,480
Hey! I will be right back.

1437
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:26,440
Let’s go.

1438
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:29,080
Let’s go.
- Hello!

1439
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:30,280
That was for me.

1440
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:32,520
Oh!

1441
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:38,600
Is your leg fine?

1442
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:39,760
Does it pain?

1443
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:42,920
Thanks for everything, Arjun.
You may leave now.

1444
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:48,000
Should I leave?

1445
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:49,600
What happened, Anjali?

1446
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:51,320
Why are you behaving
like this suddenly?

1447
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:52,760
What did I do?

1448
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,280
I am normal.

1449
01:40:58,280 --> 01:40:59,200
What?

1450
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,160
That’s unbelievable.

1451
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:08,120
You’re just unbelievable.

1452
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:10,600
What is your problem, Arjun?

1453
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:12,640
Do you love me?
- What can I say if you ask me that?

1454
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:15,200
Do you love me?
- No. And that is exactly my point.

1455
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:16,880
There’s nothing to talk.

1456
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,680
So, are we done?

1457
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:22,960
Is that right?

1458
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:30,880
I don’t want a commitment for 5 years.

1459
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:35,560
But, it is hard to give a commitment
if you remain to be like this.

1460
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:39,000
This is me Arjun!

1461
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:44,320
I don’t like to have expectations
or depend on someone.

1462
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:45,680
So?

1463
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:50,360
Will you marry someone without
having any expectations?

1464
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:51,320
Am I right?

1465
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:52,320
Superb!

1466
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:53,920
It’s nice.

1467
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:01,920
Try to live your life.

1468
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:03,320
You just got one life.

1469
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,480
Arjun! Try to be serious with your life.

1470
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:07,000
You just got one life.

1471
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:20,120
Sister! Uncle is here.

1472
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,640
Is it?
- Yes. I called him up.

1473
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:28,120
They said that she’s fine.

1474
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:31,640
What is it? How is your mom?
- She’s stable, uncle.

1475
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:32,840
Sorry, dear.

1476
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:35,080
The weather condition wasn’t good
in Vijayawada.

1477
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:37,440
I came by road. That is why I am late.
- No problem, uncle.

1478
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:40,160
Mom is fine. They’ll discharge her tomorrow.

1479
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:43,480
Anu called you because she thought
that the situation is serious.

1480
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,120
She did the right thing.

1481
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:46,760
I planned to come here, anyway.

1482
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:48,520
Where is the doctor?
I will have a word.

1483
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:49,600
I will go and check.

1484
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,920
There’s no problem. She is stable.

1485
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,920
They gave her medicines.
So, she should be fine.

1486
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:55,680
OK.

1487
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:01,400
See you, grandma.

1488
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:02,480
Bye.

1489
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:03,360
What happened, Arjun?

1490
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:05,720
Is he the one from the picture
that was emailed?

1491
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:06,880
Arjun?

1492
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:08,000
Yes, uncle.

1493
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:11,840
I am Anjali’s uncle.

1494
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:13,400
I stay in Vijayawada.

1495
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:14,560
Hello.

1496
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:15,960
What are you doing here?

1497
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:19,000
Is the match fixed?
- Obviously.

1498
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:25,280
I have to talk to you personally
for five minutes.

1499
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:26,600
Come.

1500
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:27,880
Sir! But..

1501
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:28,840
Sir.

1502
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:36,520
Cigarette?

1503
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:38,360
But, this is a hospital.

1504
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:47,520
This is an open place.

1505
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:49,640
What do you do?

1506
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:52,640
I work for this firm called Techart.

1507
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:55,840
Basically, we provide business processes.
- You need to know few things, Arjun.

1508
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:59,360
I’ll be frank. So, please don’t mind.

1509
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:03,000
You are one lucky bugger
in the world.

1510
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:05,000
I don’t know much about you.

1511
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:08,760
But, let it be anyone in this world.

1512
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,640
Nobody deserves her.

1513
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:13,960
What do you know about Anjali?

1514
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:15,640
What?

1515
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:17,560
It is about Anjali.

1516
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:22,040
Anjali’s dad died when she was
13 years old.

1517
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:26,840
The value to word dad…

1518
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:30,040
The one who loses their dad knows
the value of relations.

1519
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:35,200
Anjali got to know that
while she was young.

1520
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:42,920
I took a loan and started a new business.

1521
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:51,000
I told Anjali that I wasn’t in a position
to take care of them.

1522
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:59,800
That 13 years old kid said that
she will take care of everything.

1523
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:07,400
She took care of her family since then.

1524
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:14,440
She took classes for lower grade
students after school hours.

1525
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:18,280
She took care of her family
with that money.

1526
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:27,640
I went to them after I got settled
and asked them to come with me.

1527
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:32,960
She said that I am stable
by God’s grace.

1528
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:35,120
You should be like that.

1529
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:40,240
She questioned me if I can handle it
when the situation changes.

1530
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:45,160
She said that it is better to not
get habituated to that.

1531
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:48,480
She said that she will take care of everything.

1532
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:51,880
That’s my Anjali.

1533
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:56,840
Anjali is the strength of their family.

1534
01:45:57,320 --> 01:46:03,440
So, she got habituated to handle every situation
by herself. Be it sad or happy.

1535
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:15,240
Uncle! The doctor is here
and waiting for you.

1536
01:46:15,640 --> 01:46:16,320
OK. Let’s go.

1537
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:39,760
“There’s a smile on your face”

1538
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:47,600
“There might be tough situations
that can’t be seen”

1539
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:56,920
“It showers from above and
the earth rejoices”

1540
01:46:57,080 --> 01:47:04,520
“There’s something in between that takes
the responsibility to give happy outcome”

1541
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:12,800
“There are many ways to
hold your overview”

1542
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:20,600
“It is not easy to be stable
after knowing your story”

1543
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:32,280
Yeah…

1544
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:33,760
That’s right.

1545
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:35,240
Don’t worry, Anjali.

1546
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:38,120
Doctor! She got up and
wants to see everyone.

1547
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:38,840
Is that OK?

1548
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:39,720
Yeah, sure.

1549
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:40,920
You may go and see.

1550
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:41,720
Come.
- OK.

1551
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:42,920
Let’s go.
- Ma’am! Just a second.

1552
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:45,600
I will give you the diet chart
and the list of medicines for a week.

1553
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:46,960
You should follow that.

1554
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:49,400
OK. Tell me.

1555
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:58,120
Latha...
-What happened?

1556
01:47:58,280 --> 01:47:59,800
Did the guy say yes to Anjali?

1557
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:03,120
Take rest. We'll talk in the morning.
-Did he say yes?

1558
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:05,440
He didn't just say yes.

1559
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:08,360
He came all the way here.
For you...

1560
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:12,800
Anu...

1561
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:14,880
Call your brother-in-law.
-Okay, uncle.

1562
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:49,240
Arjun...

1563
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:54,800
I mean... Can I call you that, son-in-law?

1564
01:48:54,840 --> 01:48:56,960
Ah, come on! You don't
have to be so formal?

1565
01:48:57,520 --> 01:48:58,600
Call me Arjun.

1566
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:09,000
Son-in-law is meeting me for the
first time and I am on the bed.

1567
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:10,560
I feel bad.

1568
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:12,160
It's okay.

1569
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:16,840
Arjun...

1570
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:22,640
Don't let the thought of me scare you.

1571
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,600
I am just a burden in Anjali's life.

1572
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:33,440
Don't fear the burden will fall onto you.

1573
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:35,800
I'll take care of myself

1574
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:38,080
I'll go somewhere.

1575
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,160
I'll not spoil your life.

1576
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:46,760
I just want Anjali to be happy.

1577
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:50,880
She's a really good girl.

1578
01:49:58,120 --> 01:49:59,240
I understand now.

1579
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:07,160
I now understand why
Anjali is the way she is.

1580
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:11,960
Anjali is just like you.

1581
01:50:13,160 --> 01:50:14,440
So selfless...

1582
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:18,800
She's always thinking of you.

1583
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:25,440
In fact, she totally forgot what
it is to think for herself.

1584
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:31,600
Like you said, your Anjali
is a really good girl.

1585
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:36,520
But I realised it after I met you.

1586
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:39,040
It's in your upbringing.

1587
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:47,320
After I met Anjali and spoke to her...

1588
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:49,440
I understood something.

1589
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:54,240
You are no burden to Anjali.

1590
01:50:57,880 --> 01:50:59,400
You are Anjali's strength.

1591
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:24,480
Go to sleep.

1592
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:27,040
Take rest.

1593
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:36,360
Come on, everyone. Let's go outside.

1594
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:37,600
Let her rest.

1595
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:47,600
Good boy.
-Bye...

1596
01:51:58,320 --> 01:51:59,920
Where's Anjali?
-I don't know

1597
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:01,760
She left angrily without saying a thing.

1598
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:28,320
Why'd you come back?

1599
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:39,920
Anjali...

1600
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:41,520
What else do you want?

1601
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:43,520
I'll have many problems
from tomorrow because of you.

1602
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:45,560
I don't know what to tell everyone.

1603
01:52:45,680 --> 01:52:48,200
Didn't I ask you to drop me
at the hospital and leave?

1604
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:49,200
What have you done?

1605
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:51,360
You came to the hospital.
Met granny and Anu.

1606
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:53,280
I asked you to go home once again.

1607
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:56,800
But you came to my flat.
Everyone in my flat saw you.

1608
01:52:57,040 --> 01:53:01,480
You came to the hospital again.
Met uncle and my mom too.

1609
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:04,880
If I tell them this alliance isn't fixed...

1610
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:08,040
They'd assume you must've said yes.
And that makes me the villain.

1611
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:09,400
You only said you didn't
want marriage, right?

1612
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:10,720
Why did you complicate things then?

1613
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:11,640
[DOOR BELL]

1614
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:19,880
Good morning, dear.
-Is it dawn already? Give me a minute.

1615
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:44,000
Dear, it's okay.
I'll go home and get another litre.

1616
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:45,800
Idiot!

1617
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,280
Anjali...
-Don't touch me!

1618
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:57,080
You men, I say!

1619
01:53:57,200 --> 01:54:00,480
All the men break trust and leave.

1620
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:02,960
Dad, uncle... Everyone...

1621
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:06,840
But when I ask you to leave...
You keep coming back.

1622
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:09,960
I love that you come back.
But I hate that I love it.

1623
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:12,160
Don't irritate me, Arjun. Go!

1624
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:15,240
I said, go!

1625
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:18,040
Sorry, Anjali.

1626
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:25,240
Oh, are you leaving? Go... Leave...

1627
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:28,480
What's your problem, Anjali?
What do you want me to do?

1628
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:31,520
Do you want me to stay or leave?
-You wouldn't understand, idiot!

1629
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:34,080
You only said I keep coming
back when you ask me to leave.

1630
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:35,880
You love that I come back but
you hate that...

1631
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:43,480
Anjali...

1632
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:45,520
Anjali...!

1633
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:07,880
Arjun, go!

1634
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:10,280
Go...!

1635
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:13,640
I'll not go.

1636
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:16,840
I understood something.

1637
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:19,080
I shouldn't listen to your words.

1638
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:22,040
Only your eyes speak the truth.

1639
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,360
Look at me and ask me to leave.
I'll leave.

1640
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:30,520
Look at me, Anjali.

1641
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:43,360
Arjun...

1642
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:46,360
You wouldn't wake up and
change your mind, right?

1643
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:49,400
You wouldn't think this
was a mistake, would you?

1644
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:53,040
If that's the case, tell
me right now, Arjun.

1645
01:56:57,520 --> 01:56:58,440
I can't take it.

1646
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:06,560
Will you marry me?

1647
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:16,280
Come on then.

1648
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:18,360
Let's get married.

1649
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,480
Come on...
-What? Right now?

1650
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:27,280
Yeah, Anjali. I'm being serious.

1651
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:29,520
I want to stay with you hereafter.

1652
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:31,680
That's what our parents wanted anyways.

1653
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:33,600
We are just getting married in advance.

1654
01:57:34,280 --> 01:57:36,960
What? Are you crazy?
What are you saying?

1655
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:40,160
I am talking with a lot of
clarity for the first time.

1656
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:41,960
Think about it.

1657
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:45,480
If they fix the wedding
5 months from now...

1658
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:48,680
Think about the tension
your mom would feel.

1659
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:51,680
But if we get married before
she is discharged and home...

1660
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:53,000
She'll be really happy.

1661
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:56,240
There's no more tension.
No wedding expenses borne too.

1662
01:57:56,520 --> 01:57:58,920
We've already decided, right?
Why do we have to delay this?

1663
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:01,520
If we get married right away,
we can be together starting now.

1664
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:04,800
What an outstanding plan!
I am a genius.

1665
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:07,640
I'll go get the car. Come fast.

1666
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:09,640
Hey, what do you mean come fast?

1667
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:12,680
Arjun...!

1668
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:16,360
Arjun, stop it! Wait...
Arjun, come inside.

1669
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:19,840
Arjun...!

1670
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:22,440
Please...

1671
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:27,880
Arjun...!

1672
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:36,480
It's such a ridiculous idea.
What's wrong with you?

1673
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:37,440
Really?

1674
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:40,520
Oh, god! Arjun, stop!

1675
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:45,320
Arjun, why did I get into the car?
I made a huge mistake.

1676
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:49,960
So, your name Anjali starts
with 'A' and so does mine.

1677
01:58:50,120 --> 01:58:53,080
Are we naming our kids with 'A' too?

1678
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:57,480
No. Baby boy will be named Mahesh.
-Hey, are you Mahesh's fan?

1679
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,520
Me too, you know.
Huh?

1680
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:00,440
Yep.

1681
01:59:02,840 --> 01:59:05,240
Arjun, I don't even know who
your favourite hero is.

1682
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:07,640
I know nothing about you.
How can we get married already?

1683
01:59:07,680 --> 01:59:11,240
Please stop the car. Please...

1684
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:12,120
Look, Anjali...

1685
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:16,080
I've long decided I'll marry the
girl who sees me without pants.

1686
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:18,120
The first girl broke up and left.

1687
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:20,600
You are the second. So, I'll marry you.

1688
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:23,840
So, she saw you without pants?

1689
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:27,960
You mean, you got physical?
-Obviously.

1690
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:32,040
It was a three year relationship.
I mean... Quite a few times...

1691
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:36,360
Stop the car.
-Why?

1692
01:59:36,680 --> 01:59:38,400
I said stop the car!
-What?

1693
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:41,600
I only want a virgin husband.
Stop the car!

1694
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:43,880
I also didn't want a virgin wife.

1695
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,960
Aren't I adjusting? You should too.

1696
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:47,880
You cheapo!

1697
01:59:47,960 --> 01:59:50,960
Anjali, let me drive.
-How can you say that?

1698
02:00:40,200 --> 02:00:41,240
Where's your phone?

1699
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:54,720
Hi, Mani... Tell me.

1700
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:55,960
Hi, mom...

1701
02:00:56,840 --> 02:00:59,800
Arjun, where the hell are you?
I'll kill you.

1702
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:02,880
I asked you to meet me
once but you ran away.

1703
02:01:03,080 --> 02:01:05,480
Your phone is ringing at home.
Anjali's phone is switched off.

1704
02:01:05,480 --> 02:01:08,520
No one at their place answers the call.
You irresponsible idiot!

1705
02:01:09,080 --> 02:01:11,840
What do I tell them, huh?
You've embarrassed me.

1706
02:01:12,240 --> 02:01:13,360
This is too far.

1707
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:16,120
So irresponsible of you!
-Mom... Mom...!

1708
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:18,400
What?
-Open the door, mom.

1709
02:01:18,440 --> 02:01:20,760
Oh, you are here. Coming...

1710
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:22,560
I would've just killed you.

1711
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:28,800
Hi, mom...

1712
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,200
You won the bet, mom.
I love Anjali.

1713
02:01:56,040 --> 02:01:57,560
Nurse...
-Doctor?

1714
02:01:57,600 --> 02:01:59,160
The patient in this room was
discharged yesterday. Yeah.

1715
02:01:59,240 --> 02:02:00,560
Yeah.
-Who's this then?

1716
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:03,720
I don't know, doctor.
-How can you be so irresponsible?

1717
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:05,120
Check if he's alive or dead.

1718
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:23,240
What were you admitted for?
Is it diarrhoea?

1719
