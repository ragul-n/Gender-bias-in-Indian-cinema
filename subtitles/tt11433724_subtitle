1
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:58,268
In the State of Uttar Pradesh,
especially in the Jhansi district...

2
00:02:58,435 --> 00:03:02,602
Murders, robberies and gang rapes have been
occurring frequently since the last 6 months.

3
00:03:02,727 --> 00:03:06,810
Government has failed to take action
despite filing charges.

4
00:03:06,977 --> 00:03:10,810
Video footage of these incidents
has been released recently.

5
00:03:11,018 --> 00:03:13,477
It's so horrendous...
Have a look for yourself.

6
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:31,768
Look closely...

7
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:37,643
You can witness all the murders, robberies
and gang rapes in the district of Jhansi.

8
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:41,477
Bandits are bringing shame to Uttar Pradesh.

9
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:43,518
State Tourism has been highly affected.

10
00:03:43,685 --> 00:03:47,143
The whole world wants to catch
a glimpse of the famous Taj Mahal.

11
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:52,893
Indian devotees believe a dip in the holy river
of Ganges washes away your sins.

12
00:03:53,018 --> 00:03:55,352
But they are terrified to visit the state..

13
00:03:55,602 --> 00:04:02,018
Electronic print media is criticizing
the inefficiency of the Government.

14
00:04:02,352 --> 00:04:06,310
We must get the district of Jhansi
under our control at any cost.

15
00:04:07,393 --> 00:04:08,393
Officers...

16
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,810
I need a solution.

17
00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:11,060
Police should be granted power.

18
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:14,685
Top criminals will be wiped out
if encounter is permitted.

19
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:17,143
Others will automatically stay low out of fear.

20
00:04:17,393 --> 00:04:18,435
It won't stop them.

21
00:04:18,977 --> 00:04:20,560
Crime will only upsurge.

22
00:04:20,977 --> 00:04:25,727
The reason even commoners are complying
with bandits is hunger.

23
00:04:26,518 --> 00:04:27,727
First we must erase that hunger.

24
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,310
Minister, you could eat to fulfill your hunger.

25
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:33,268
Officer, to be honest,
that's not the solution.

26
00:04:33,935 --> 00:04:35,977
Tell us how to reduce crime.

27
00:04:36,102 --> 00:04:37,143
Through agriculture.

28
00:04:37,435 --> 00:04:38,393
Agriculture?!

29
00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:40,727
Mr. Tagore, how does agriculture impact crime?

30
00:04:40,935 --> 00:04:43,852
It does...  Agriculture generates revenue.

31
00:04:44,602 --> 00:04:47,060
That develops education.

32
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:50,060
Development in education enriches culture.

33
00:04:50,768 --> 00:04:53,102
Civilized culture eradicates crime.

34
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:56,143
Correct! But our citizens
aren't skilled in agriculture.

35
00:04:56,227 --> 00:04:57,602
- Let's teach them.
- But how?

36
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:01,143
In the States of Andhra and Telangana where
rivers Krishna and Godavari flow...

37
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:08,685
There are many farmers who harvest crop
like it's worship.

38
00:05:08,977 --> 00:05:10,227
You find farm labor as well.

39
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,977
Do you want me to summon farmers
from those States?

40
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:14,602
Yes... Let's see what they can do.

41
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,768
This document states that
the Government of Uttar Pradesh

42
00:05:17,935 --> 00:05:19,852
leases these 5000 acres to you
for 30 years.

43
00:05:21,143 --> 00:05:23,352
If you irrigate this land and pay

44
00:05:23,393 --> 00:05:26,810
a small percentage of the profits
to the Government..

45
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:29,852
After 30 years, according to
the Survey Act of India...

46
00:05:29,935 --> 00:05:31,602
You'll be the rightful owners
of all these fields.

47
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:37,060
Uttar Pradesh Government...

48
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:41,227
Will provide you with the required amenities,
under the Special Category quota.

49
00:05:42,102 --> 00:05:43,518
You will progress...

50
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:45,435
And in turn help our citizens progress.

51
00:05:45,643 --> 00:05:49,602
Sir, you summoned us from a far off State,

52
00:05:49,768 --> 00:05:52,102
offering thousands of acres for us to own.

53
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,060
Today onwards, we're under your submission.

54
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,810
We promise you, sir.

55
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,477
We'll toil hard and harvest good crop,
thus fulfilling your dreams.

56
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,227
Documents from the Uttar Pradesh Government,
addressed to the 500 families...

57
00:06:04,477 --> 00:06:05,935
In regard to the crop fields.

58
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,102
We're grateful, sir.

59
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,143
Years have passed...
On Mr. Virendranath Thakur's advice,

60
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,643
Telugu farmers from Andhra Pradesh
triumphed in producing harvest

61
00:06:16,935 --> 00:06:20,435
in the barren lands of Uttar Pradesh.

62
00:06:20,768 --> 00:06:22,685
Citizens of that State...

63
00:06:22,935 --> 00:06:25,893
Have learned the art of agriculture from
Telugu farmers and developed their lifestyle.

64
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,310
The State was no more
drought and hunger stricken.

65
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:31,852
It was flourishing with people that
were well educated and mannered.

66
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,310
But the crime rates have only gone up.

67
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,810
Only this time, crimes were not
as evident as before.

68
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,393
It's the ideal place for our project.

69
00:06:55,518 --> 00:06:56,768
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

70
00:06:56,852 --> 00:06:59,518
Apply to the UP Government for permissions
right away.

71
00:06:59,602 --> 00:07:00,602
Okay! Okay!

72
00:07:01,185 --> 00:07:03,935
Also, gather the farmers owning
these lands.

73
00:07:04,435 --> 00:07:06,393
- We'll pay the advance next week.
- Okay, ma'am.

74
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:18,227
Hey! Hey! Hey!

75
00:07:29,643 --> 00:07:30,810
Who is he?

76
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,060
Hey! He crashed on our car.

77
00:07:40,143 --> 00:07:41,643
Someone move him.

78
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:53,352
Go check if he's fine.

79
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,393
He's barely breathing, ma'am.

80
00:07:58,477 --> 00:07:59,977
- Get him into the car.
- Why?

81
00:08:00,185 --> 00:08:01,643
He looks like a seasoned criminal.

82
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:03,602
Why do you want to get into trouble?

83
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:04,852
I don't care who he is.

84
00:08:05,227 --> 00:08:07,352
Human life is valuable...
Aren't you human?

85
00:08:07,602 --> 00:08:11,185
Look for a good hospital in the area.

86
00:08:11,352 --> 00:08:12,227
- Okay, ma'am.
- Okay, ma'am.

87
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,393
Get him into my car.

88
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,435
Come on.

89
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,477
Open your eyes slowly.

90
00:08:50,518 --> 00:08:51,518
Slowly...

91
00:08:51,768 --> 00:08:53,310
Yes... Good.

92
00:08:53,518 --> 00:08:54,602
Slowly.

93
00:08:55,393 --> 00:08:56,602
You're alright.

94
00:08:56,768 --> 00:08:57,643
You're absolutely fine.

95
00:08:57,727 --> 00:09:00,685
But I was told it's a massive heart attack.

96
00:09:01,143 --> 00:09:03,810
Nothing to worry...

97
00:09:05,143 --> 00:09:07,143
I returned from Hyderabad the same day.

98
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:10,518
I'll be there with you
if something happens to you.

99
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:16,518
You couldn't breathe because of fluid
build up in your lungs.

100
00:09:16,727 --> 00:09:19,352
So we had to admit you in an ICU
and put you on oxygen supply.

101
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,477
You'll be perfectly alright in a week.

102
00:09:23,977 --> 00:09:25,143
Upstairs!

103
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,185
Round table conference!

104
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:30,685
You're in a hospital.

105
00:09:30,935 --> 00:09:34,477
Oh... You admitted a guy in bloodshed
last week.

106
00:09:34,685 --> 00:09:36,393
Are you referring to that patient?

107
00:09:37,352 --> 00:09:38,852
Okay. He's here.

108
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:49,727
He has multiple stab wounds on his body.

109
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,102
Also, he has severe head trauma.

110
00:09:52,268 --> 00:09:56,602
Doctors can't assess his medical condition
until he's out of the coma.

111
00:09:57,018 --> 00:10:00,852
In my time, I've never seen a patient with
such severe injuries make it out alive.

112
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:02,143
It's a miracle.

113
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,727
He's still alive,
only to achieve something, ma'am.

114
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:08,185
Don't worry...
I'll take care of you both.

115
00:10:08,352 --> 00:10:13,935
Sister-in-law, our company staff and I
are praying for your speedy recovery.

116
00:10:14,268 --> 00:10:18,477
I also cancelled my US trip
regarding a important meeting.

117
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,643
Is she asking me to go to US or get out?

118
00:10:21,852 --> 00:10:22,935
Both... Leave.

119
00:10:23,518 --> 00:10:24,727
I'll go out then.

120
00:10:25,143 --> 00:10:28,268
What kind of a hospital is this?
Such a nice hospital!

121
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:33,102
They saved her when I was hoping she'd die.

122
00:10:33,227 --> 00:10:35,935
She's showing attitude like a champion now.

123
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:36,935
What can I do, sir?

124
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,602
Your family doctor from Hyderabad
is right beside her.

125
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,018
I couldn't help it, sir.

126
00:10:41,102 --> 00:10:42,060
Then why...

127
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,310
Why did you take money from me?

128
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,935
I'll get the job done tonight, sir.

129
00:10:47,143 --> 00:10:48,727
I'm going to my hotel room.

130
00:10:48,935 --> 00:10:52,935
Tonight, I want to hear the news,
Asian Group of Companies MD,

131
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,810
renowned industrialist Sarojini Naidu's death.

132
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:56,602
- I want to see this breaking news on TV.
- Okay, sir.

133
00:10:56,685 --> 00:10:57,685
Go!

134
00:10:57,935 --> 00:11:00,143
[WHISTLING]

135
00:12:28,143 --> 00:12:29,060
Sister...

136
00:13:46,352 --> 00:13:47,435
What are you saying?

137
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:50,435
You want to adopt him and introduce him
as your heir?

138
00:13:50,685 --> 00:13:51,143
Yes.

139
00:13:51,185 --> 00:13:53,435
If you make a criminal the heir
to our ventures...

140
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,310
It will ruin the lives of 8000 families
that depend on us.

141
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:57,560
Who's the criminal here?

142
00:13:57,685 --> 00:13:58,643
You or him?

143
00:13:58,935 --> 00:14:00,352
Every time you make a mistake,

144
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:02,643
I spare you only because you're my cousin.

145
00:14:03,352 --> 00:14:04,268
No, Saru.

146
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,435
Going by his wounds,

147
00:14:06,643 --> 00:14:09,268
one would assume he's a criminal.

148
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:11,977
I have no suspicions.

149
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,935
Anyone who saves a life is good by heart.

150
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:17,227
Yes.

151
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:21,143
He risked his life to save mine.

152
00:14:21,435 --> 00:14:22,935
Imagine how selfless he is.

153
00:14:24,477 --> 00:14:29,268
We have no relation whatsoever.

154
00:14:30,685 --> 00:14:33,060
I lost my father and son in an accident.

155
00:14:33,643 --> 00:14:35,143
I'm surrounded by people and yet,

156
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,852
I feel lonely.

157
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:40,727
If someone like him becomes
my successor...

158
00:14:40,935 --> 00:14:43,935
He'll stand by my staff and
our chain of companies.

159
00:14:44,227 --> 00:14:45,560
That is why I've made this decision.

160
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:48,143
He might be a good man like you said...

161
00:14:48,435 --> 00:14:50,227
But let's hold a police enquiry...

162
00:14:50,393 --> 00:14:53,060
Find out his details and
then take a decision.

163
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,685
He was stabbed severely.

164
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,393
You think he'll live if he revisits his past?

165
00:14:57,685 --> 00:14:59,185
No police. No enquiry.

166
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,685
Vijji, don't bother about the expenses.

167
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,560
It is your responsibility to save him.

168
00:15:06,935 --> 00:15:08,268
What is his condition now?

169
00:15:08,477 --> 00:15:09,810
He's recovering slowly.

170
00:15:10,393 --> 00:15:13,060
Because of a severe blow to his head...

171
00:15:13,435 --> 00:15:15,935
He has a blood clot from
cerebral hemorrhage.

172
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,102
So he has forgotten his past completely.

173
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,643
Chances of remembering are thin.

174
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:24,768
Good for us.

175
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,310
More than his past that almost
got him killed...

176
00:15:29,227 --> 00:15:32,143
His future as the Head of my companies
is important to me.

177
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:35,352
Look, Durga Prasad...

178
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:44,185
If you, our staff or anybody else
tries to remind him of his past...

179
00:15:44,852 --> 00:15:46,393
I won't spare you this time.

180
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,935
Replace my son's photographs with his
in all our family albums.

181
00:15:52,393 --> 00:15:55,768
Also, send him abroad for IT training.

182
00:15:55,977 --> 00:15:56,935
Oh my god!

183
00:15:57,268 --> 00:15:59,102
What do you mean?

184
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:02,143
I mean, oh my god, what an idea!

185
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:03,685
I'll look after his training.

186
00:16:05,102 --> 00:16:07,352
She's giving way too much
importance to a stranger.

187
00:16:07,643 --> 00:16:08,435
Listen...

188
00:16:08,602 --> 00:16:09,393
Yes?

189
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,977
What's my Late son's name?

190
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:11,935
Arjun Prasad.

191
00:16:12,185 --> 00:16:13,852
He is Arjun Prasad from this moment.

192
00:16:15,102 --> 00:16:15,768
Okay.

193
00:16:15,935 --> 00:16:16,727
And...

194
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:20,852
Get a police enquiry on the murder
attempt on me...

195
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:22,143
And submit those reports to me.

196
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,935
Okay.

197
00:16:24,935 --> 00:16:26,477
Okay... Okay.

198
00:16:26,643 --> 00:16:28,810
I'll make arrangements and
shift him to Hyderabad.

199
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:29,768
Thank you, Vijji.

200
00:16:31,102 --> 00:16:31,727
Saru...

201
00:16:33,477 --> 00:16:35,768
This is the only thing I found on him.

202
00:17:23,102 --> 00:17:24,727
What's this? Is it correct?

203
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:26,477
I'm not happy with your explanation.

204
00:17:26,518 --> 00:17:27,477
Saraswati!

205
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,685
You're fired! Get out!

206
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:32,602
From today onwards,
she's not your team leader.

207
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:34,268
- Go to your cabins.
- Yes, sir.

208
00:17:35,602 --> 00:17:37,310
Sir, what have I done?

209
00:17:37,477 --> 00:17:38,435
Don't you know?

210
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,143
I wanted you to show that foreign client
around the city.

211
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,102
How dare you raise your hand on him!

212
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,018
He misbehaved with me, sir.

213
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:47,560
Foreigner misbehaved with you?!

214
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:49,477
- Yes, sir.
- What did he do?

215
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,310
- Did he touch here? Huh?
- No, sir.

216
00:17:51,518 --> 00:17:52,768
- Is this what he did?
- No, sir!

217
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:54,768
Or did he touch here?

218
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:55,685
No, sir!

219
00:17:55,852 --> 00:17:57,352
Is this how he misbehaved?

220
00:17:57,685 --> 00:17:59,602
- No, sir.
- Is this wrong?

221
00:17:59,727 --> 00:18:00,935
Isn't it western culture?

222
00:18:01,102 --> 00:18:02,768
Tell her, guys...
Ask them about it.

223
00:18:03,852 --> 00:18:05,518
A foreigner didn't consider it wrong.

224
00:18:05,643 --> 00:18:07,018
Our staff doesn't too.

225
00:18:07,143 --> 00:18:08,268
But you have a problem.

226
00:18:08,518 --> 00:18:09,768
Mr. Prabhakar!

227
00:18:10,727 --> 00:18:13,143
If this girl works over here...

228
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:14,560
Then I'll make a move.

229
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:18,310
Look. He offered us
2000 crore-worth project.

230
00:18:18,393 --> 00:18:20,310
He says he's going to leave
if you continue to work here.

231
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:24,893
If he does, I'd have to fire
500 staff members to compensate.

232
00:18:25,018 --> 00:18:28,935
I'll make sure you will never get
a software job.

233
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:32,018
I hereby put you in the blacklist
and rusticate you.

234
00:18:32,227 --> 00:18:32,977
Out!

235
00:18:33,393 --> 00:18:34,227
Get out!

236
00:18:34,352 --> 00:18:35,143
Please, sir.

237
00:18:35,685 --> 00:18:39,727
My family will be on the streets
if you put me in the blacklist.

238
00:18:39,977 --> 00:18:41,893
You're dismissed! Get out!
Please try to understand, sir.

239
00:18:42,102 --> 00:18:43,477
- Please, sir.
- Get lost!

240
00:18:50,685 --> 00:18:51,685
Mom and dad...

241
00:18:51,893 --> 00:18:55,768
You raised me with self-respect...
That was your generation.

242
00:18:56,143 --> 00:18:59,310
Our generation compromises on life.

243
00:18:59,852 --> 00:19:03,227
I'm mentally exhausted,
trying to fill the gap.

244
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:08,018
There's no point living,
once your self-respect is lost.

245
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,435
That's what you always told me.

246
00:19:09,935 --> 00:19:11,102
I lost my job.

247
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,018
I lost my self-respect.

248
00:19:13,477 --> 00:19:15,227
I know our financial status...

249
00:19:15,477 --> 00:19:16,935
I cannot be a burden to you.

250
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,977
I'll end my life.

251
00:19:19,352 --> 00:19:20,602
Forgive me.

252
00:19:38,518 --> 00:19:40,643
- Sorry, sir.
- Saraswati!

253
00:19:41,393 --> 00:19:44,102
God didn't create you to end
your life this way.

254
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,685
Life is meant to be celebrated.

255
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,560
There's a lot to achieve.

256
00:19:47,643 --> 00:19:51,727
Once you do, God will take you home
in his own time.

257
00:19:52,393 --> 00:19:54,143
We shouldn't rush to get there.

258
00:19:54,352 --> 00:19:56,602
I have no hopes on my life, sir.

259
00:19:57,435 --> 00:19:58,852
I want to die, sir.

260
00:19:58,935 --> 00:20:00,893
Saraswati, listen to me.

261
00:20:01,102 --> 00:20:02,352
This isn't just about you.

262
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:04,143
If you want your family to be happy...

263
00:20:04,352 --> 00:20:05,810
Please listen to me and get down.

264
00:20:05,852 --> 00:20:06,935
I'm sorry, sir.

265
00:20:15,102 --> 00:20:16,018
Oh my God!

266
00:20:18,768 --> 00:20:20,810
Sir, I want to die... Please let go.

267
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:22,018
- Please!
- Then die.

268
00:20:23,518 --> 00:20:26,352
Sir, please. I'm begging you.

269
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,852
Fold your hands and do it.
I'll let go.

270
00:20:29,143 --> 00:20:31,477
- Sir, I'm scared. Let me go.
- You wanted to die, right?

271
00:20:31,602 --> 00:20:33,893
How come you want to live now?

272
00:20:34,268 --> 00:20:35,102
Up!

273
00:20:56,852 --> 00:21:00,977
"Take a look at this action hero"

274
00:21:01,102 --> 00:21:05,268
"Wonder what his name is
and where he belongs from"

275
00:21:05,393 --> 00:21:09,602
"Take a bow to his vigor"

276
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,977
"Welcome him with a whistle and take a selfie"

277
00:21:14,227 --> 00:21:16,227
"Like the King of the Jungle"

278
00:21:16,435 --> 00:21:18,352
"Like an angry avenger"

279
00:21:18,518 --> 00:21:21,852
"He entered like the return of the dragon"

280
00:21:21,977 --> 00:21:24,060
"He looks quite class"

281
00:21:24,227 --> 00:21:26,227
"But his heart is with the masses"

282
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:30,227
"He's a typical white collar corporate ruler"

283
00:21:32,643 --> 00:21:33,643
Good morning, sir.

284
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:36,352
It's a bad morning for you!

285
00:21:36,477 --> 00:21:37,477
Why, sir?

286
00:21:38,102 --> 00:21:39,018
Where's Saraswati?

287
00:21:39,143 --> 00:21:40,102
I dismissed her, sir.

288
00:21:40,143 --> 00:21:41,435
- Huh?
- I dismissed her, sir.

289
00:21:41,518 --> 00:21:42,102
Why?

290
00:21:42,227 --> 00:21:43,768
She slapped our foreign client, sir.

291
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:44,977
- She slapped him?
- Yes, sir.

292
00:21:45,102 --> 00:21:46,018
How'd she do it?

293
00:21:46,518 --> 00:21:47,435
Like this?

294
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,102
- Sir...
- Answer me.

295
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:51,435
How'd she hit him? Like this?

296
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,310
Or like this?

297
00:21:54,018 --> 00:21:55,477
Or did she do it like this?

298
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:01,102
It's his job to defend the firm
he's working for.

299
00:22:01,643 --> 00:22:05,477
But he's favoring foreign clients
for their souvenirs.

300
00:22:05,685 --> 00:22:08,352
Do you call him a broker or
a Project Manager?

301
00:22:08,477 --> 00:22:10,102
You call him a Project Broker.

302
00:22:10,477 --> 00:22:18,102
Software Engineers brought the revolution
of accessing the world from our fingertips.

303
00:22:18,477 --> 00:22:20,518
They look like drunkards to you?!

304
00:22:20,768 --> 00:22:24,643
Employees in the line of IT,
hailing from middle class families

305
00:22:24,727 --> 00:22:25,685
and farming background...

306
00:22:25,768 --> 00:22:27,727
If you treat them like prostitutes...

307
00:22:29,935 --> 00:22:33,227
You're quite unfit to work
in this environment.

308
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,602
- Out!
- Sir...

309
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:35,643
I said get out!

310
00:22:35,727 --> 00:22:37,393
- Mr. Arjun Prasad!
- Yes?

311
00:22:37,768 --> 00:22:39,643
You might be the Chairman of this company.

312
00:22:39,935 --> 00:22:42,768
But you don't have any right to hit
a human being like this.

313
00:22:44,768 --> 00:22:45,727
Human being?!

314
00:22:47,143 --> 00:22:49,477
- You mean I have no right?
- No!

315
00:22:51,518 --> 00:22:52,310
Okay.

316
00:22:54,393 --> 00:22:55,685
Saraswati!

317
00:23:08,768 --> 00:23:09,727
Is this right?

318
00:23:09,852 --> 00:23:11,518
- What say, uncle?
- Absolutely right.

319
00:23:12,018 --> 00:23:15,560
But you have every right to molest a girl
in my company, huh?

320
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,935
I will take this project away.

321
00:23:18,018 --> 00:23:20,852
There will be no more projects
from our company.

322
00:23:20,935 --> 00:23:22,518
My foot, your company!

323
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,852
- What?!
- My shit, your project!

324
00:23:25,602 --> 00:23:28,435
Hey! What do you think about India, man?

325
00:23:28,727 --> 00:23:32,102
You think we're selling our souls, dignity,

326
00:23:32,268 --> 00:23:35,643
courage, culture and traditions
to you people?

327
00:23:37,185 --> 00:23:40,893
We're just selling a small part of
our knowledge and intelligence.

328
00:23:41,102 --> 00:23:42,227
Keep that in mind.

329
00:23:42,352 --> 00:23:44,685
Don't you dare think that
you're our happiness.

330
00:23:45,435 --> 00:23:47,560
You are happy because of us!

331
00:23:48,477 --> 00:23:52,727
If I file a complaint on you under
Section 345A, Nirbhaya Act...

332
00:23:53,102 --> 00:23:55,893
Then you'll not see your country
for the next 3 years.

333
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,143
No! I'm sorry.

334
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,435
Then leave my country.

335
00:23:59,602 --> 00:24:00,477
Now!

336
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,977
Okay. I'm sorry.

337
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:03,852
- Saraswati...
- Sir...

338
00:24:03,935 --> 00:24:06,602
You're our Project Manager from today.
Take charge.

339
00:24:06,768 --> 00:24:10,643
"He's like a blazing ball of fire"

340
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:14,435
"He overcomes the darkness with might"

341
00:24:15,393 --> 00:24:19,227
"He is back again to rule"

342
00:24:19,435 --> 00:24:22,977
"He will destroy the darkness and spread light"

343
00:24:23,935 --> 00:24:27,810
"He's like a blazing ball of fire"

344
00:24:28,018 --> 00:24:31,143
"He overcomes the darkness with might"

345
00:24:32,518 --> 00:24:36,268
"He is back again to rule"

346
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:39,935
"He will destroy the darkness
and spread light"

347
00:24:58,435 --> 00:25:02,018
"No matter how much he has conquered"

348
00:25:02,227 --> 00:25:06,352
"He will never forget his roots"

349
00:25:07,018 --> 00:25:10,518
"No matter how much he has achieved"

350
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:14,602
"He's still a little kid to his mother"

351
00:25:15,143 --> 00:25:23,268
"He's a man of dignity,
never hangs his head down"

352
00:25:23,727 --> 00:25:29,643
"He has the upper hand
in every endeavor of his"

353
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,143
"He's the resonating sound of success"

354
00:25:35,102 --> 00:25:35,810
Yes, ma'am?

355
00:25:35,977 --> 00:25:37,143
You wanted to see me?

356
00:25:38,935 --> 00:25:39,852
Thank you.

357
00:25:40,018 --> 00:25:41,310
May I know the reason?

358
00:25:41,393 --> 00:25:43,227
It's not just Economic Times.

359
00:25:43,352 --> 00:25:45,227
Check out all the magazines it appeared in.

360
00:25:46,977 --> 00:25:48,977
Our company EV Labs is ranked second...

361
00:25:49,268 --> 00:25:51,518
While the Asian Software Company
is ranked first.

362
00:25:51,768 --> 00:25:55,393
You said you'd bribe the judges
at the IT competition this year.

363
00:25:55,518 --> 00:25:57,018
You also took money from me.

364
00:25:57,893 --> 00:25:59,393
I convinced them to rule in our favor.

365
00:25:59,435 --> 00:26:00,977
But I couldn't get the 3rd judge's
appointment.

366
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:01,977
What's that fellow's name?

367
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,227
Mr. Ramoji Rao.

368
00:26:03,393 --> 00:26:04,977
He's apparently busy reading newspaper
in the morning.

369
00:26:05,102 --> 00:26:06,893
Tasting ‘Priya' pickles in the afternoon.

370
00:26:07,018 --> 00:26:08,602
Attending ‘Margadarsi' meeting
in the evening.

371
00:26:08,727 --> 00:26:10,393
- He's very busy.
- What nonsense!

372
00:26:10,518 --> 00:26:12,560
- Get out from here right now!
- When do you want me to come back?

373
00:26:13,268 --> 00:26:14,352
Out forever!

374
00:26:14,518 --> 00:26:15,977
Alright. See you in the morning.

375
00:26:16,227 --> 00:26:18,477
Harika, what you've done is  unacceptable.

376
00:26:18,602 --> 00:26:20,518
Not at all, sir...
She slapped me so hard.

377
00:26:20,602 --> 00:26:22,143
- Get out!
- Bye, ma'am.

378
00:26:23,477 --> 00:26:24,518
What's not acceptable, dad?

379
00:26:24,643 --> 00:26:27,685
You competed with that company for
several years when you were Chairman.

380
00:26:28,018 --> 00:26:28,810
Could you do it?

381
00:26:28,977 --> 00:26:33,268
I'll scale the first position as the Chairman.

382
00:26:33,393 --> 00:26:34,518
Harika...

383
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:37,893
You can get competitive in business...
But not envious.

384
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,560
This is what you guys raised me to be.

385
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:42,810
That's your logic, huh?

386
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,102
Why are you going down
the wrong path for it?

387
00:26:45,393 --> 00:26:47,477
Money will not get the job done.

388
00:26:47,893 --> 00:26:48,602
Your intelligence will.

389
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:53,352
Our company couldn't beat theirs
when Mrs. Sarojini Naidu was the CEO.

390
00:26:53,685 --> 00:26:57,977
Now her son has trained abroad and
developed the company within a year.

391
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:01,310
It's not so easy to beat him.

392
00:27:01,518 --> 00:27:03,768
He might be the King in business.

393
00:27:04,518 --> 00:27:07,518
But I'll figure out his strengths
and weaknesses.

394
00:27:07,977 --> 00:27:09,643
I'll hit him where it hurts.

395
00:27:35,768 --> 00:27:39,393
"He's so handsome he pulls your attention"

396
00:27:39,518 --> 00:27:43,727
"You can't take your eyes off him
once you're engaged"

397
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:47,977
"Girls would never want to miss his company"

398
00:27:48,102 --> 00:27:52,102
"He keeps changing his number to avoid chaos"

399
00:27:52,352 --> 00:27:56,310
"He's all for fun but always in his limits"

400
00:27:56,518 --> 00:28:00,643
"He's a loyal man to his woman
through everything"

401
00:28:00,893 --> 00:28:05,018
"No riches in the world can tempt him"

402
00:28:11,935 --> 00:28:15,643
"He's like a blazing ball of fire"

403
00:28:16,102 --> 00:28:19,810
"He overcomes the darkness with might"

404
00:28:20,393 --> 00:28:28,227
"He is back again to rule"

405
00:28:29,018 --> 00:28:32,935
"He's like a blazing ball of fire"

406
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:36,227
"He overcomes the darkness with might"

407
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:45,102
"He is back again to rule"

408
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:52,602
I know that you bribed two judges
to rank your company the best.

409
00:28:52,727 --> 00:28:54,852
One of the judges is my close friend.
- I know.

410
00:28:54,893 --> 00:28:57,602
To design cloud data security threat solution...

411
00:28:57,852 --> 00:29:02,018
HSBC invited both our companies to Bangkok.

412
00:29:02,143 --> 00:29:03,143
I know.

413
00:29:03,227 --> 00:29:05,768
Arjun Prasad will be representing
our company in Bangkok.

414
00:29:05,893 --> 00:29:07,727
You will be representing your company.

415
00:29:09,102 --> 00:29:10,268
Of course you know.

416
00:29:10,477 --> 00:29:11,643
But you don't know...

417
00:29:12,227 --> 00:29:15,102
Which hotel he'll be staying in...
And what his room number is.

418
00:29:15,268 --> 00:29:17,227
This envelope has all the details.

419
00:29:17,602 --> 00:29:18,518
So what?

420
00:29:18,643 --> 00:29:23,852
Full details of the project software
are in Arjun Prasad's laptop.

421
00:29:23,977 --> 00:29:26,018
If you hack that laptop and
get hold of the software...

422
00:29:26,143 --> 00:29:28,018
You'll crack a project worth 5000 crores.

423
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:31,935
So, this is a good opportunity for
your company to be ranked 1st.

424
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,310
You're giving away so many details.

425
00:29:34,435 --> 00:29:36,352
What are your expectations?
- 50 percent?

426
00:29:37,893 --> 00:29:38,602
40 percent?

427
00:29:40,143 --> 00:29:41,435
Okay 30 percent.

428
00:29:42,143 --> 00:29:43,435
20 percent at least.

429
00:29:44,227 --> 00:29:45,852
10 percent, ma'am. Just 10 percent.
- Okay.

430
00:29:45,977 --> 00:29:47,018
Yes! Thank you!

431
00:29:47,602 --> 00:29:50,352
Damn! Why is this idiot coming my way?

432
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,893
He would've agreed for 2 percent
after a few more slaps.

433
00:29:54,143 --> 00:29:55,477
- Krishna Reddy...
- Yes, ma'am.

434
00:29:55,643 --> 00:29:58,227
- I need hackers immediately.
- Okay, ma'am.

435
00:29:58,352 --> 00:30:01,227
- But it's not Diwali time.
- What?

436
00:30:01,352 --> 00:30:03,602
- You asked for crackers, right?
- Not crackers...

437
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:05,977
- I meant hackers.
- Oh, hackers!

438
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,227
They should travel to Bangkok with me.

439
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,310
Bangkok?! Done, ma'am. Done.

440
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:12,143
You're still the same, huh?

441
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,935
Will you give 50 percent then?

442
00:30:14,102 --> 00:30:16,143
- You see my shoe here?
- Not my size.

443
00:30:20,102 --> 00:30:22,685
Sir, where can I find hackers?

444
00:30:23,102 --> 00:30:25,393
I don't know about hackers but my gun...

445
00:30:25,477 --> 00:30:27,768
I know, sir. I know where it is.

446
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:30,227
Either tell me you know or you don't.

447
00:30:30,352 --> 00:30:32,352
You know nothing about hackers and
you own a software company.

448
00:30:32,435 --> 00:30:33,310
Hey!

449
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,810
I was just saying your family is so chill.

450
00:30:35,893 --> 00:30:37,352
He's got the ears of a snake.

451
00:30:40,727 --> 00:30:43,102
- Who are you looking for?
- You wanted 3 hackers, right?

452
00:30:43,227 --> 00:30:45,310
- I'm trying to find them.
- 3 hackers? What for?

453
00:30:45,393 --> 00:30:46,935
You're getting a laptop hacked, so...

454
00:30:47,018 --> 00:30:48,102
Hush!

455
00:30:48,393 --> 00:30:50,018
One for hacking the laptop.

456
00:30:50,143 --> 00:30:51,602
One for stealing the laptop.

457
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:52,685
One for helping them out.

458
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:53,727
- A helper?
- Hmm.

459
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,685
To whom?

460
00:30:56,185 --> 00:30:57,310
You're a helper.

461
00:30:57,435 --> 00:30:58,560
You want another helper, huh?

462
00:30:58,685 --> 00:30:59,602
Idiot!

463
00:30:59,685 --> 00:31:00,435
Come on, ma'am.

464
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,268
If an intelligent woman like you
needs an assistant...

465
00:31:02,352 --> 00:31:04,268
It's obvious for an idiot like me.
- You stop this.

466
00:31:04,477 --> 00:31:08,102
- What do you know about the 3 hackers?
- They're not intellects or idiots like us.

467
00:31:08,268 --> 00:31:09,768
- They're geniuses.
- Washington!

468
00:31:09,852 --> 00:31:11,518
- It's me, ma'am.
- Arnold!

469
00:31:11,852 --> 00:31:13,602
- Jackie Chan!
- It's me.

470
00:31:13,768 --> 00:31:15,143
- Yes.
- All three of you...

471
00:31:15,727 --> 00:31:17,018
Keep the bags here.

472
00:31:17,602 --> 00:31:19,227
- What is she saying?
- She's asking us to lie down on the belt.

473
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,102
- This idiot doesn't understand English.
- Oh, yeah.

474
00:31:21,227 --> 00:31:23,643
- Bye. Bye.
- Don't go. Stop.

475
00:31:24,102 --> 00:31:24,893
Wait!

476
00:31:25,768 --> 00:31:27,352
- Please listen to me.
- Okay, we're going.

477
00:31:28,935 --> 00:31:30,518
- Sir! This is not the way.
- Ah, so comfortable!

478
00:31:30,685 --> 00:31:32,852
- Bye! See you soon.
- Hey mister! Stop!

479
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:35,352
- Boom! Boom! Boom!
- Hello, sir.

480
00:31:36,935 --> 00:31:37,852
Hey.

481
00:31:38,643 --> 00:31:39,685
Hey.

482
00:31:40,268 --> 00:31:41,143
Hey!

483
00:31:43,227 --> 00:31:44,393
Why are you shoving us, huh?

484
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:46,643
We're going.

485
00:31:47,143 --> 00:31:48,310
You're so great, ma'am.

486
00:31:48,477 --> 00:31:50,435
- Because of people like you...
- What's up, Reddy?

487
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,227
She's so freaking beautiful, man.
Where'd you find her?

488
00:31:53,602 --> 00:31:54,643
That's my Chairman ma'am.

489
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:55,685
Ma'am?

490
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:57,977
She's a hottie.

491
00:31:58,227 --> 00:31:59,393
What do you mean?

492
00:31:59,602 --> 00:32:02,977
Err... He meant to say you look rich.

493
00:32:03,143 --> 00:32:05,268
Green. Red. Yellow.

494
00:32:05,477 --> 00:32:06,143
Yewww!!!

495
00:32:06,268 --> 00:32:07,810
They look like traffic lights.

496
00:32:07,977 --> 00:32:10,560
You only find these colors
on the footpath, ma'am.

497
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,727
- Footpath?!
- Forget about that, ma'am.

498
00:32:12,852 --> 00:32:15,310
Tell me if your flight is AC or non-AC.

499
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:16,268
What?!

500
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:18,310
It's their first flight, ma'am.

501
00:32:18,435 --> 00:32:21,310
Of course ma'am would book
AC tickets for us.

502
00:32:21,435 --> 00:32:23,227
What do you think of ma'am, huh?
- Hottie!

503
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,227
Hey!

504
00:32:24,602 --> 00:32:27,352
The guy approaching...
We need to hack his laptop.

505
00:32:28,143 --> 00:32:30,435
Behave like we are strangers.

506
00:32:39,727 --> 00:32:40,768
What's going on?

507
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:42,935
Why is it following him?

508
00:32:43,018 --> 00:32:44,893
Maybe there's a puppy in it.

509
00:32:45,102 --> 00:32:47,227
- Our job only gets easier then.
- How?

510
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,018
We just have to sigh at the dog
with biscuits.

511
00:32:51,268 --> 00:32:52,852
It will start following us.

512
00:32:52,935 --> 00:32:55,102
- First you guys follow me.
- Yes, boss!

513
00:32:55,518 --> 00:32:57,018
Excuse me, sir. One minute.

514
00:32:57,143 --> 00:32:58,393
Catch it, catch it.

515
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:01,227
- Sir, this has no ventilation.
- What if the dog died of suffocation?

516
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,143
See. It's not even barking.
Really?

517
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,477
- What's the matter with you guys?
- Which dog are you talking about?

518
00:33:05,643 --> 00:33:07,018
How is it following you?

519
00:33:07,143 --> 00:33:08,393
Oh, that thing?

520
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,852
This is my Bluetooth suitcase.

521
00:33:09,977 --> 00:33:11,810
My mobile is connected to Bluetooth.

522
00:33:11,893 --> 00:33:14,018
It will follow you if you walk now.

523
00:33:14,143 --> 00:33:14,935
Really?

524
00:33:15,102 --> 00:33:16,893
Let's test it once.
- I'll also join.

525
00:33:18,602 --> 00:33:20,602
[CLAMOR]

526
00:33:28,602 --> 00:33:29,727
Bloody fools.

527
00:33:30,185 --> 00:33:31,643
- Thank you.
- I have to thank you.

528
00:33:31,768 --> 00:33:33,685
- What for?
- For returning my suitcase.

529
00:33:35,102 --> 00:33:36,310
Excuse me, sir.

530
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,518
- What?
- It's an important matter, sir.

531
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:39,727
What is it?

532
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:42,477
You see that girl in brown
sitting behind you?

533
00:33:44,227 --> 00:33:45,227
Yes.

534
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,352
We four have nothing to do with her.

535
00:33:48,518 --> 00:33:50,018
You must remember it.

536
00:33:58,356 --> 00:34:00,148
"Enjoy your life, man"

537
00:34:00,356 --> 00:34:02,231
"Enjoy your life, man"

538
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,815
"That is why you're given this life"

539
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,940
Shut up!

540
00:34:08,315 --> 00:34:10,731
Hello! We didn't come to Bangkok to shut up.

541
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:14,356
Reddy, I heard Bangkok is full of hotties.

542
00:34:14,565 --> 00:34:15,565
Where can I find them?

543
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,106
Look. You're a hacker.

544
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,231
Book a masseur on one of the
online massage centers.

545
00:34:19,315 --> 00:34:20,106
Book one for me too.

546
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,856
- Super idea!
- Ma'am, we mean to say...

547
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,856
I know you mean item girls.

548
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:24,981
She finally found out.

549
00:34:25,065 --> 00:34:26,690
I look so cheap to you, huh?

550
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:27,815
Character-less idiots!

551
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,690
- Are they really hackers?
- Hello, ma'am.

552
00:34:30,106 --> 00:34:31,940
This might be our first flight.

553
00:34:32,106 --> 00:34:33,815
We might be attracted to women...

554
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:36,356
That doesn't mean we're womanizers.

555
00:34:36,815 --> 00:34:38,065
Give me your phone.

556
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:40,731
Ma'am, phone...

557
00:34:41,731 --> 00:34:43,106
Hey! This is my phone.

558
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:45,565
When did you steal it?
- When you bent down in the flight...

559
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,065
I stole it from your back pocket.

560
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,398
- You thieves!
- That's our profession.

561
00:34:49,981 --> 00:34:54,731
Reddy booked us only after taking all
our details from the Madhapur Police Station.

562
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,440
Didn't you tell ma'am, Reddy?

563
00:34:56,815 --> 00:34:57,606
- I mean...
- Whatever.

564
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,606
- Why did you steal my phone?
- Tell.

565
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,148
Don't yell, ma'am.

566
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:05,398
I hacked Arjun Prasad's suite in Marriott
from your phone.

567
00:35:05,565 --> 00:35:10,315
I made a booking for the same suite
on the same day in your name.

568
00:35:10,481 --> 00:35:12,815
Try to understand.
You can check your messages if you want.

569
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,148
What about the room I booked?

570
00:35:14,273 --> 00:35:15,606
We took it.

571
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,856
- Where do I go?
- Have a good time with him.

572
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:19,940
I meant have a good time in the suite.
- Yes, ma'am.

573
00:35:20,023 --> 00:35:21,940
- Nonsense!
- Why are you getting angry, ma'am?

574
00:35:22,065 --> 00:35:23,190
Because you'll be in the same suite...

575
00:35:23,273 --> 00:35:25,940
We can easily access it with your key.

576
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:30,190
We'll steal and hack the laptop
just like you said.

577
00:35:30,273 --> 00:35:32,940
Once we transfer the file to you,
our company will be No.1.

578
00:35:33,273 --> 00:35:33,940
Yeah.

579
00:35:33,981 --> 00:35:34,690
Yeah.

580
00:35:35,398 --> 00:35:36,148
Yeah.

581
00:35:36,398 --> 00:35:37,106
Yeah.

582
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,648
Will he agree to share the suite with me?

583
00:35:40,731 --> 00:35:42,023
Why are you asking me?

584
00:35:42,231 --> 00:35:45,023
Ask her whether she's willing to share
the same suite with me.

585
00:35:45,065 --> 00:35:45,856
Please, ma'am.

586
00:35:45,981 --> 00:35:47,523
Due to some technical issues...

587
00:35:47,648 --> 00:35:50,231
The same suite room has been blocked
for the both of you.

588
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,023
Just give me another suite then.

589
00:35:52,148 --> 00:35:53,481
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

590
00:35:53,648 --> 00:35:55,731
All the rooms have been booked already.

591
00:35:55,981 --> 00:35:59,815
There are 2 separate bedrooms
in the Presidential Suite.

592
00:36:00,106 --> 00:36:02,398
Of course you'd have to share the hall.

593
00:36:02,648 --> 00:36:03,815
Please, ma'am.

594
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:06,606
Hmm.

595
00:36:06,815 --> 00:36:08,356
- Yes!
- Yay!

596
00:36:10,273 --> 00:36:11,731
Don't push me... Slowly.

597
00:36:31,065 --> 00:36:32,106
A twist!

598
00:36:33,148 --> 00:36:35,315
Why is he doing that?

599
00:36:36,148 --> 00:36:39,481
You've sent a beautiful girl to his suite.

600
00:36:39,523 --> 00:36:41,481
How else would he react?

601
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,273
But once they're in the room, we...

602
00:36:44,815 --> 00:36:46,690
Cool. Cool. I know where to take you.

603
00:36:47,398 --> 00:36:48,273
Okay.

604
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,606
How will you figure out which
one is Arjun Prasad's?

605
00:36:52,731 --> 00:36:54,065
Ah, ma'am. That's no big deal.

606
00:36:54,148 --> 00:36:57,940
Arjun Prasad's room is the one with
the sensor briefcase... Am I right?

607
00:36:58,023 --> 00:37:00,940
Yeah, right. Don't act like
you've invented it.

608
00:37:01,065 --> 00:37:02,106
That's fine.

609
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,106
- One minute.
- Okay, ma'am.

610
00:37:07,398 --> 00:37:08,606
Yes, come in!

611
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,023
Oh. Hi, Arjun!

612
00:37:16,065 --> 00:37:17,606
Hey! Hey! Wake up!

613
00:37:17,856 --> 00:37:19,523
Arjun Prasad has entered madam's room.

614
00:37:19,606 --> 00:37:21,940
- Wake up.
- Turn the video recording on.

615
00:37:21,981 --> 00:37:23,523
- You can't do that on this.
- Oh. No video?

616
00:37:23,815 --> 00:37:26,398
I wanted to check out the view
from your room.

617
00:37:26,481 --> 00:37:27,481
Oh, of course.

618
00:37:27,565 --> 00:37:29,315
You can shift to this room if you want.

619
00:37:29,398 --> 00:37:31,023
No. No. Both are the same.

620
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,648
- Okay.
- Sorry to disturb you.

621
00:37:32,815 --> 00:37:33,731
No problem.

622
00:37:34,648 --> 00:37:35,565
By the way, Harika...

623
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,106
We have a recreation event at 4' o clock.

624
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:39,231
You're coming, right?

625
00:37:39,356 --> 00:37:40,815
Oh no! I'm really tired.

626
00:37:41,023 --> 00:37:42,190
It's okay. Take rest.

627
00:37:42,315 --> 00:37:43,065
Sure.

628
00:37:46,315 --> 00:37:47,231
He left.

629
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,356
- He left, guys.
- She must've shooed him away.

630
00:37:50,523 --> 00:37:52,106
Ma'am, why did you deny his invite?

631
00:37:52,273 --> 00:37:53,981
You have to take part in the event.

632
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:55,565
You should keep Arjun distracted.

633
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,815
Only then will my men sneak in
and hack his laptop.

634
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,481
Oh, that's your plan?

635
00:38:00,815 --> 00:38:01,648
Super!

636
00:38:02,023 --> 00:38:03,856
I'm full of ideas, ma'am.

637
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,231
Ma'am, one more thing.

638
00:38:06,356 --> 00:38:10,315
Lock your room and drop the key
in the trash bin outside the hotel.

639
00:38:10,523 --> 00:38:11,481
In the trash bin?

640
00:38:11,565 --> 00:38:13,940
- That's the signature spot for beggars.
- Nothing to do with you, ma'am.

641
00:38:14,023 --> 00:38:15,731
He thinks he's from a royal family.

642
00:38:15,815 --> 00:38:17,315
Hey, give me the phone.

643
00:38:17,481 --> 00:38:18,731
I need to discuss something.

644
00:38:19,231 --> 00:38:21,231
Hello, ma'am. One more important thing.

645
00:38:21,356 --> 00:38:22,481
- What?
- Nothing much.

646
00:38:22,565 --> 00:38:23,940
Go to bed and let us rest.

647
00:38:24,065 --> 00:38:25,315
I can't hack the laptop otherwise.

648
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,023
Hang up now... Reddy, catch.

649
00:38:50,065 --> 00:38:55,481
"Pamper my cherry red lips"

650
00:38:57,815 --> 00:39:03,106
"Why don't you give me attention?"

651
00:39:05,481 --> 00:39:09,231
"I'm so falling in love with you, handsome"

652
00:39:09,315 --> 00:39:13,106
"I know you admire my waist
as you embrace it"

653
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:16,815
"Why don't you claim me right away?"

654
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:20,106
"Anyone would easily fall for you"

655
00:39:20,856 --> 00:39:24,148
"Any man in his true senses would"

656
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:27,856
"Anyone would easily fall for you"

657
00:39:28,523 --> 00:39:31,731
"Any man in his true senses would"

658
00:40:03,523 --> 00:40:07,315
"I'm like a beauty lamp
beyond Aladdin's reach"

659
00:40:07,398 --> 00:40:10,940
"But I'm here for you so light me up"

660
00:40:11,273 --> 00:40:15,023
"I'm the apple Isaac Newton
couldn't get hold of"

661
00:40:15,106 --> 00:40:18,398
"But I'm here for you so grab me quickly"

662
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,273
"If you keep tempting me"

663
00:40:20,356 --> 00:40:22,440
"I'll show you what I'm made of"

664
00:40:22,565 --> 00:40:24,148
"You're a Goddess of grace"

665
00:40:24,273 --> 00:40:26,315
"I can help you carry your elegance"

666
00:40:26,398 --> 00:40:27,981
"You're like a bundle of sparkles"

667
00:40:28,065 --> 00:40:30,106
"I'll open the doors to your fantasies"

668
00:40:30,231 --> 00:40:31,690
"I know how naughty you can get"

669
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,940
"So let me calm your senses"

670
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:37,440
"Do whatever you want to me"

671
00:40:37,648 --> 00:40:40,523
"Anyone would easily fall for you"

672
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:44,231
"Any man in his true senses would"

673
00:40:45,315 --> 00:40:48,648
"Anyone would easily fall for you"

674
00:40:49,148 --> 00:40:52,356
"Any man in his true senses would"

675
00:41:26,023 --> 00:41:29,940
"I'm handing you my beauty
like a bottle of champagne"

676
00:41:29,981 --> 00:41:33,481
"Why are you looking around?"

677
00:41:33,815 --> 00:41:40,856
"What could be more important than
wrapping your arms around me?"

678
00:41:41,023 --> 00:41:44,981
"The way you giggle makes me go
weak in the knees"

679
00:41:45,065 --> 00:41:46,690
"Don't fly away, girl"

680
00:41:46,815 --> 00:41:48,856
"I'll have my youth catch up"

681
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,523
"You're like a sweet delicacy"

682
00:41:50,606 --> 00:41:52,690
"Let me have you as a whole"

683
00:41:52,856 --> 00:41:56,648
"I'll pull my bag of tricks on you"

684
00:41:56,815 --> 00:41:59,981
"Caress me and don't keep calm"

685
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,815
"Anyone would easily fall for you"

686
00:42:04,023 --> 00:42:06,940
"Any man in his true senses would"

687
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:11,398
"Anyone would easily fall for you"

688
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:14,690
"Any man in his true senses would"

689
00:42:32,065 --> 00:42:33,231
Hey, Jackie Chan!

690
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,231
Hey! Stop playing with the suitcase.

691
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,856
Laptop is inside.

692
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,523
- Is it? Be careful.
- Come on...

693
00:42:48,481 --> 00:42:49,898
Where did I leave my key?

694
00:42:50,065 --> 00:42:51,065
What do you need it for?

695
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,481
We're already inside.

696
00:42:53,981 --> 00:42:54,940
- Good night.
- Let's meet at dinner.

697
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:55,940
Okay.

698
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,190
Ma'am, keep him engaged for another
30 minutes.

699
00:43:01,398 --> 00:43:02,398
We're transferring the project.

700
00:43:02,481 --> 00:43:04,481
- Where are you guys?
- In Arjun Prasad's room.

701
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:05,398
What?!

702
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:07,981
- Excuse me.
- Yes, come in.

703
00:43:08,148 --> 00:43:09,731
- Oh, sorry.
- Do you need something?

704
00:43:10,315 --> 00:43:11,190
Nothing.

705
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:15,398
Does your room have a balcony?

706
00:43:15,731 --> 00:43:17,815
Yeah. But there's nobody there.

707
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,856
You were peeping, so...

708
00:43:21,023 --> 00:43:21,815
Just casually.

709
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:22,940
Bye.

710
00:43:26,606 --> 00:43:27,731
Where are you guys?

711
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,440
Bah! In Arjun Prasad's room.

712
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:30,231
Don't disturb us.

713
00:43:30,273 --> 00:43:31,815
We're in the middle of something important.

714
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,523
In Arjun's room?

715
00:43:35,148 --> 00:43:37,940
Wow! I wish there was a lady
joining me here.

716
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,815
Reddy, I'm already dreaming about it.

717
00:43:43,148 --> 00:43:44,815
Wow! What a beauty!

718
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,856
She's way hotter than ma'am.

719
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,815
Want me to book her?

720
00:43:52,065 --> 00:43:52,981
Go ahead.

721
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:57,815
Reedy, what is your ‘smoking hot' ma'am
doing in my dream?

722
00:43:58,398 --> 00:44:03,273
"You appear in my dreams"

723
00:44:04,815 --> 00:44:05,981
You bloody idiots!

724
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:07,940
Ma'am... Ma'am...

725
00:44:17,231 --> 00:44:18,023
You...

726
00:44:18,606 --> 00:44:21,440
You were supposed to be my assistant
and this is what you're doing here.

727
00:44:21,481 --> 00:44:22,606
Actually, ma'am...

728
00:44:22,731 --> 00:44:24,440
From today onwards, you're fired.

729
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:38,856
Excuse me!

730
00:44:38,981 --> 00:44:40,023
Who's that?

731
00:44:40,315 --> 00:44:41,148
It's me!

732
00:44:41,356 --> 00:44:42,523
Please come in.

733
00:45:07,315 --> 00:45:08,148
Hey!

734
00:45:08,523 --> 00:45:09,648
Yuck! Yewww!

735
00:45:09,815 --> 00:45:11,273
- Just come over here.
- Sorry, ma'am.

736
00:45:14,356 --> 00:45:17,023
First of all, why did you come
into this bedroom?

737
00:45:17,148 --> 00:45:18,606
Why did you come into this room?

738
00:45:19,148 --> 00:45:20,856
- What?
- Don't say what.

739
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,481
What are you doing in Arjun Prasad's room?

740
00:45:22,606 --> 00:45:23,690
This is Arjun Prasad's room?

741
00:45:23,815 --> 00:45:25,731
We saw the sensor box in this room.

742
00:45:26,315 --> 00:45:27,815
Sensor box? Where?

743
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,940
Ain't like you're seeing this room
for the first time.

744
00:45:31,106 --> 00:45:32,940
You've already been here, right?

745
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:34,315
You just shut up, okay?

746
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,065
Wow! You cover up well, ma'am.

747
00:45:36,106 --> 00:45:36,815
Yes, ma'am.

748
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:41,648
We went nuts when we found your
intimate wear here.

749
00:45:41,815 --> 00:45:45,356
Your PA said it's obvious that
you're attracted to him.

750
00:45:46,148 --> 00:45:47,440
Why are you getting me into trouble?

751
00:45:47,481 --> 00:45:49,273
- Let me save you.
- Okay...

752
00:45:49,565 --> 00:45:53,523
He said you must be so tired you
got undressed here...

753
00:45:53,731 --> 00:45:57,148
And went back to your room all alone.

754
00:45:58,231 --> 00:45:59,606
You're doing me no good.

755
00:45:59,815 --> 00:46:00,856
I didn't say that, ma'am.

756
00:46:01,023 --> 00:46:02,940
I said you put on a robe and
went to your room.

757
00:46:03,023 --> 00:46:05,940
Hey! I don't want this project or you hackers.

758
00:46:06,148 --> 00:46:07,815
Hello! You can't cancel now.

759
00:46:07,856 --> 00:46:08,815
Are you kidding me?

760
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,273
I'm transferring the project file to you
from Arjun Prasad's laptop.

761
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,815
It's almost done.

762
00:46:13,981 --> 00:46:15,231
- Look.
- Move.

763
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,190
Look.

764
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:23,273
Are you transferring my project from
my laptop back to me?

765
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:25,315
This is your laptop?

766
00:46:25,731 --> 00:46:28,648
Ma'am, why'd you get your laptop
to his room?

767
00:46:28,815 --> 00:46:31,440
Come on! It's like watching cooking video
while cooking.

768
00:46:32,315 --> 00:46:34,356
- Just get out of my room right now!
- Okay.

769
00:46:34,523 --> 00:46:36,648
Harika, what happened?
Why were you yelling?

770
00:46:37,106 --> 00:46:37,981
Sir!

771
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:42,815
Why are you coming from madam's room,
wrapped in a towel?

772
00:46:43,023 --> 00:46:46,023
So all your clothes are
in madam's room, huh?

773
00:46:46,398 --> 00:46:47,815
I've seen your guys before.

774
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,190
I know. You're those jokers from the airport.

775
00:46:50,273 --> 00:46:51,190
Don't call us jokers, sir.

776
00:46:51,398 --> 00:46:53,231
Do we look like jokers to you?

777
00:46:53,481 --> 00:46:55,856
I'm a senior helper, thief and hacker.

778
00:46:56,023 --> 00:46:56,940
He's the broker.

779
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:58,815
- Hey! I'm the PA.
- Yeah. The PA broker.

780
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,273
You guys are hackers?

781
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:02,398
- Then I'll call the police.
- Go ahead.

782
00:47:02,523 --> 00:47:07,273
We know everyone in Cyberabad, Banjara Hills,
Madhapur and Jubilee Hills Police Stations.

783
00:47:07,481 --> 00:47:08,940
Uh-huh. I'll call the Bangkok Police.

784
00:47:09,148 --> 00:47:10,981
- Nah. We don't know them.
- That's not the issue.

785
00:47:11,148 --> 00:47:13,023
Bangkok Police will straight away shoot us.

786
00:47:13,106 --> 00:47:14,440
- Oh no!
- Get out!

787
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:16,065
Silly fellows!

788
00:47:16,356 --> 00:47:17,273
Hurry up!

789
00:47:17,356 --> 00:47:18,190
Look...

790
00:47:19,398 --> 00:47:19,815
Harika...

791
00:47:33,606 --> 00:47:35,606
What are you doing here alone?

792
00:47:36,522 --> 00:47:37,522
Hello!

793
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,064
You want that project.

794
00:47:40,481 --> 00:47:43,106
You want be on the top. Am I right?

795
00:47:44,897 --> 00:47:48,022
Here... The project file
I will be presenting tomorrow.

796
00:47:48,647 --> 00:47:49,397
Take it.

797
00:47:49,522 --> 00:47:51,606
You planned all of it to get this, right?

798
00:47:52,647 --> 00:47:55,064
My mom spoke highly of your company.

799
00:47:55,356 --> 00:47:56,731
We both are in the same field.

800
00:47:56,814 --> 00:47:58,481
I don't want any difference between us.

801
00:47:59,106 --> 00:48:00,439
Come on! Take it.

802
00:48:03,439 --> 00:48:05,022
Why are you crying? Hello?

803
00:48:05,731 --> 00:48:07,606
I'm handing over this project whole-heartedly.

804
00:48:07,772 --> 00:48:08,731
No.

805
00:48:09,439 --> 00:48:11,772
I feel so guilty.

806
00:48:11,981 --> 00:48:13,272
Please punish me.

807
00:48:13,606 --> 00:48:14,731
Okay.

808
00:48:15,272 --> 00:48:16,856
I will give you a punishment.

809
00:48:17,147 --> 00:48:18,814
- Please.
- From today...

810
00:48:19,314 --> 00:48:20,606
Forever...

811
00:48:21,772 --> 00:48:23,147
We are friends.

812
00:48:25,189 --> 00:48:26,606
Come on! Shake hand.

813
00:48:43,731 --> 00:48:48,272
"Let's have some fun today"

814
00:48:49,064 --> 00:48:54,106
"Let's find the right time to swing away"

815
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:57,189
"I finally found a beautiful treasure"

816
00:48:57,356 --> 00:48:59,939
"Show how much you love me"

817
00:49:00,064 --> 00:49:04,356
"I'm coming to you like an angry lion"

818
00:49:05,314 --> 00:49:07,897
"Let's have some fun today"

819
00:49:08,022 --> 00:49:10,606
"I can keep it going all night"

820
00:49:10,731 --> 00:49:15,231
"Let me have a taste of your sweet youth"

821
00:49:15,606 --> 00:49:18,481
"I can hear an alarm going off
in my heart"

822
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:22,897
"Let's have some fun today"

823
00:49:23,731 --> 00:49:27,481
"Let's find the right time to swing away"

824
00:49:27,897 --> 00:49:29,522
Ma'am. We've reached the airport.

825
00:49:32,606 --> 00:49:33,731
Thanks.

826
00:49:48,731 --> 00:49:51,022
Don't get too excited about the project.

827
00:49:51,231 --> 00:49:52,897
You need to start working hard.

828
00:49:53,064 --> 00:49:54,647
You're here to train me, right?

829
00:49:54,897 --> 00:49:56,731
Okay. I don't mind.

830
00:49:56,897 --> 00:49:58,772
Oh! Thank you!

831
00:50:10,314 --> 00:50:11,772
- So...
- Hello.

832
00:50:11,897 --> 00:50:12,856
Yeah.

833
00:50:13,189 --> 00:50:15,272
You're always talking business.

834
00:50:15,939 --> 00:50:17,397
Life is also to enjoy.

835
00:50:19,939 --> 00:50:20,897
Wow!

836
00:50:32,481 --> 00:50:33,481
That's so not happening.

837
00:50:33,647 --> 00:50:36,856
I don't care if you're his lover
or my enemy.

838
00:50:37,022 --> 00:50:39,147
I hinted you about the project.

839
00:50:39,356 --> 00:50:40,814
And now that you got the project...

840
00:50:40,897 --> 00:50:42,439
Give me my 10 percent.

841
00:50:42,647 --> 00:50:44,106
You might be close to him today.

842
00:50:44,231 --> 00:50:45,439
But I knew you before he did.

843
00:50:45,606 --> 00:50:47,522
But Harika and I go way back
than you can imagine.

844
00:50:47,856 --> 00:50:50,272
Oh, sister-in-law! What are you doing here?

845
00:50:50,606 --> 00:50:51,981
She's my classmate.

846
00:50:52,397 --> 00:50:54,356
We've been family friends since forever.

847
00:50:54,606 --> 00:50:57,481
We might get competitive
when it comes to business.

848
00:50:57,772 --> 00:50:58,856
But we're friends at heart.

849
00:50:59,106 --> 00:51:00,897
You guys talk. I'll be right back.

850
00:51:00,981 --> 00:51:03,606
Seriously? If you're back...

851
00:51:03,814 --> 00:51:06,189
You'll hand me over to the police
regarding old charges.

852
00:51:06,481 --> 00:51:08,606
You'll never see me in these
surroundings again.

853
00:51:09,022 --> 00:51:11,064
- Is she your childhood friend?
- Yes!

854
00:51:11,897 --> 00:51:12,731
Friends.

855
00:51:12,814 --> 00:51:13,606
Friends.

856
00:51:13,731 --> 00:51:14,647
Bye.

857
00:51:15,022 --> 00:51:17,606
- I lost my 10 percent.
- He's like Lord Narada.

858
00:51:18,106 --> 00:51:21,106
No matter how badly he messes up,
things turn out to be in our favor.

859
00:51:21,314 --> 00:51:22,772
I know him pretty well.

860
00:51:23,731 --> 00:51:24,772
Vanitha...

861
00:51:25,022 --> 00:51:27,814
You know I'm fortunate to have
found a son like him.

862
00:51:28,439 --> 00:51:34,106
I came to your place hoping to find
his ideal match.

863
00:52:03,439 --> 00:52:05,064
- Hey, mom.
- Who is she?

864
00:52:05,231 --> 00:52:06,981
I saw her on my way home from the airport.

865
00:52:07,147 --> 00:52:09,439
I had a feeling I've seen her before.

866
00:52:09,606 --> 00:52:11,356
I could instantly feel a connection.

867
00:52:12,356 --> 00:52:13,897
Do you know anything about her?

868
00:52:14,022 --> 00:52:15,314
Nothing at all.

869
00:52:17,064 --> 00:52:20,647
Sometimes when you meet people,
they look familiar.

870
00:52:20,814 --> 00:52:21,856
Nothing out of the ordinary.

871
00:52:21,939 --> 00:52:23,189
By the way, I have good news for you.

872
00:52:23,314 --> 00:52:25,856
You'll be getting engaged to Harika
next week.

873
00:52:27,606 --> 00:52:28,856
But Harika is my friend, mom.

874
00:52:28,981 --> 00:52:30,189
I don't know about that.

875
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:31,147
Look...

876
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:34,772
I've transferred our companies
to your name, only to lose the burden.

877
00:52:35,106 --> 00:52:37,439
That doesn't mean my responsibilities
are fulfilled.

878
00:52:37,731 --> 00:52:38,981
I have one last responsibility.

879
00:52:39,397 --> 00:52:40,647
And that's your marriage.

880
00:52:50,522 --> 00:52:54,939
How dare you complain against him?

881
00:52:59,481 --> 00:53:01,606
Tell me... What's your complaint.

882
00:53:01,772 --> 00:53:06,022
Do you know anything about the
2000 Telugu farmers suffering in UP?

883
00:53:06,397 --> 00:53:08,939
They're keeping us from doing agriculture.

884
00:53:09,481 --> 00:53:11,814
Burning our hard earned harvest.

885
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:14,606
Even if we do manage to take
our produce to the market...

886
00:53:14,731 --> 00:53:17,064
They come in the way of selling it.

887
00:53:17,356 --> 00:53:22,272
So we were compelled to work
for students we taught farming to.

888
00:53:22,731 --> 00:53:28,106
Bhavaninath Thakur treats us atrociously
for we are Telugu people living there.

889
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:30,356
It's racism, sir.

890
00:53:30,606 --> 00:53:32,439
He's a cruel man.

891
00:53:32,772 --> 00:53:35,814
I didn't come to you to hear that.

892
00:53:36,272 --> 00:53:38,606
Considering 5 months of efforts
to get your appointment.

893
00:53:38,731 --> 00:53:43,522
I came to you believing you'll protect the
2000 Telugu families under his suppression.

894
00:53:43,606 --> 00:53:44,772
Listen to me, dear.

895
00:53:45,106 --> 00:53:46,439
Let me know if you cannot do it, sir.

896
00:53:46,731 --> 00:53:48,606
If we make a plea to the media...

897
00:53:48,939 --> 00:53:50,647
Both the States will be raging.

898
00:53:50,731 --> 00:53:52,731
Why are you being so aggressive?
Sit down.

899
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:56,439
Why would I let our people suffer?

900
00:53:56,647 --> 00:53:58,064
Sir, when is the enquiry
commission scheduled?

901
00:53:58,189 --> 00:53:59,772
- Tomorrow.
- Don't worry.

902
00:53:59,897 --> 00:54:01,439
With the shock treatment we gave her...

903
00:54:01,647 --> 00:54:05,606
She can't utter a single word
clearly for 48 hours.

904
00:54:07,314 --> 00:54:10,022
Medical certificate stating
she's mentally retarded.

905
00:54:11,814 --> 00:54:13,356
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you, sir.

906
00:54:14,231 --> 00:54:14,939
Hey!

907
00:54:15,147 --> 00:54:17,522
Drop her home in an ambulance.

908
00:54:17,731 --> 00:54:18,606
Okay, sir.

909
00:54:34,147 --> 00:54:35,897
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings...

910
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,189
Greetings.

911
00:54:38,106 --> 00:54:39,397
Who's the Head of the village?

912
00:54:40,231 --> 00:54:42,314
There's no title as such, sir.

913
00:54:42,606 --> 00:54:45,647
I do what they ask of me and vice versa.

914
00:54:45,939 --> 00:54:47,606
- Your name?
- Seeta Ramayya, sir.

915
00:54:47,647 --> 00:54:54,189
Accusing Local Minster Bhavaninath Thakur
of tormenting Telugu people...

916
00:54:54,356 --> 00:54:56,522
A girl from your village filed a complaint.

917
00:54:56,731 --> 00:55:02,731
Both the State Chief Ministers sent us here
to enquire,with the Supreme Court's permission.

918
00:55:02,939 --> 00:55:05,606
Tell us the truth without fearing anyone.

919
00:55:05,856 --> 00:55:07,606
Government will protect you.

920
00:55:07,731 --> 00:55:09,814
Our villages isn't facing any such issues.

921
00:55:10,022 --> 00:55:12,397
Then why did a girl from your village
file a complaint?

922
00:55:12,731 --> 00:55:13,647
She's a crazy woman.

923
00:55:13,772 --> 00:55:16,439
She's always stirring trouble by
filing random complaints.

924
00:55:16,606 --> 00:55:18,272
Check for yourself.
- Come, sir.

925
00:55:19,731 --> 00:55:20,647
That's her.

926
00:55:20,856 --> 00:55:21,939
Hello, sir.

927
00:55:22,231 --> 00:55:23,606
Why do you look dull, dear?

928
00:55:31,439 --> 00:55:32,772
Why are you pointing at the cattle?

929
00:55:32,981 --> 00:55:34,731
She loves my brother so much, sir.

930
00:55:34,856 --> 00:55:37,064
She's been acting insane ever
since he passed away.

931
00:55:37,189 --> 00:55:39,939
We've tried every treatment option
out there.

932
00:55:40,481 --> 00:55:42,356
- Are you telling the truth?
- Yes, sir.

933
00:55:42,481 --> 00:55:44,147
Do you have the medical reports?

934
00:55:44,439 --> 00:55:46,147
- They're at home, sir.
- Bring them.

935
00:55:46,647 --> 00:55:48,064
Okay.

936
00:56:05,814 --> 00:56:08,647
Hey, Judges?
How's the enquiry coming along?

937
00:56:08,981 --> 00:56:10,231
Need any help?

938
00:56:10,314 --> 00:56:11,481
No, thanks.

939
00:56:11,606 --> 00:56:13,981
Mind your own business and
we'll do the same.

940
00:56:14,272 --> 00:56:16,731
Yes, Your Honor. Please do so.

941
00:56:17,022 --> 00:56:18,814
Mind your own business.

942
00:56:20,147 --> 00:56:22,272
We must enquire all your village
authorities and citizens...

943
00:56:22,522 --> 00:56:24,397
And collect their signatures
and fingerprints.

944
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:27,147
Shoot the whole enquiry process.
- Okay, sir.

945
00:56:28,314 --> 00:56:29,022
Lakshman...
- Sir?

946
00:56:29,147 --> 00:56:32,147
- Arrange furniture for them to sit.
- Okay, sir.

947
00:56:37,814 --> 00:56:39,772
- What's your name?
- Sandhya, sir.

948
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,731
Are you facing any issues?

949
00:56:43,522 --> 00:56:44,439
No.

950
00:56:58,522 --> 00:56:59,814
- Name?
- Subbayya, sir.

951
00:56:59,939 --> 00:57:01,814
- Are you facing any issues?
- No, sir.

952
00:57:29,189 --> 00:57:31,356
Why is everyone staring at
the hay pile in terror?

953
00:57:31,522 --> 00:57:32,731
Let's go check out.

954
00:57:41,939 --> 00:57:42,731
Hey!

955
00:57:59,731 --> 00:58:00,731
Sir...

956
00:58:00,939 --> 00:58:02,981
It's no big deal...
There's a baby crying.

957
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:05,772
Her mother is breastfeeding her
back there.

958
00:58:05,981 --> 00:58:07,147
Oh... Sorry.

959
00:58:08,939 --> 00:58:12,147
By the way, I don't see any kids
around in this village.

960
00:58:16,772 --> 00:58:18,939
Because they're in school in these hours.

961
00:58:19,106 --> 00:58:20,647
Oh. Okay.

962
00:58:35,606 --> 00:58:37,314
Sir... Sir... Sir...

963
00:58:37,522 --> 00:58:39,522
Please give me my baby back.

964
00:58:40,231 --> 00:58:41,272
Hey!!!

965
00:58:41,606 --> 00:58:43,647
- Ask him to let go, sir.
- You skank!

966
00:58:43,772 --> 00:58:47,647
He wouldn't have cried if you taped
his mouth too.

967
00:58:47,897 --> 00:58:49,731
He was too really hungry, sir.

968
00:58:50,272 --> 00:58:52,189
I'm begging you. Please give me my baby back.

969
00:58:52,314 --> 00:58:56,606
You knew we would harm the kids
if you ratted us out to the judges.

970
00:58:56,731 --> 00:58:58,897
And yet, you let your baby cry out loud.

971
00:58:59,022 --> 00:59:00,606
How dare you!

972
00:59:00,647 --> 00:59:02,731
No, sir. It wasn't on purpose.

973
00:59:02,897 --> 00:59:05,022
He was crying for food.

974
00:59:05,147 --> 00:59:06,981
Oh, my baby!

975
00:59:07,731 --> 00:59:08,939
Get up, son.

976
00:59:09,064 --> 00:59:10,856
Open your eyes and look at me.

977
00:59:11,189 --> 00:59:13,106
My baby!

978
00:59:14,231 --> 00:59:16,022
Open your eyes, son.

979
00:59:16,522 --> 00:59:18,606
Baby! Baby!

980
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:21,356
Dear...!

981
00:59:21,897 --> 00:59:23,897
They killed our baby.

982
00:59:25,356 --> 00:59:28,481
Oh no! They killed my baby.

983
00:59:29,147 --> 00:59:30,939
Ask him to wake up. Come on.

984
00:59:31,022 --> 00:59:32,272
Wake him up.

985
00:59:32,397 --> 00:59:35,439
Wake up, son. Come on.
Ask him to look at me.

986
00:59:36,147 --> 00:59:37,356
Dear!

987
00:59:45,106 --> 00:59:45,897
Hey!

988
00:59:46,022 --> 00:59:48,356
Burn that low-life.

989
00:59:48,731 --> 00:59:51,356
It might lead to another enquiry.

990
00:59:52,731 --> 00:59:53,647
Go!

991
00:59:53,731 --> 00:59:54,856
No, sir!

992
00:59:55,106 --> 00:59:56,481
Sir, stop! Stop!

993
01:00:02,647 --> 01:00:04,397
Don't do it, sir!

994
01:00:04,606 --> 01:00:07,856
Bichu, throw that baby's body in the fire.

995
01:00:08,147 --> 01:00:10,481
Father and son will burn together.

996
01:00:10,606 --> 01:00:12,606
Don't do it, sir. Please.

997
01:00:12,772 --> 01:00:14,231
Don't do it.

998
01:00:17,606 --> 01:00:20,064
- My child!
- Everyone will meet the same fate.

999
01:00:22,106 --> 01:00:24,397
Until our Minister gets what he wants...

1000
01:00:24,606 --> 01:00:26,106
You're going to be our slaves.

1001
01:00:26,231 --> 01:00:27,939
Stay if you like.

1002
01:00:28,189 --> 01:00:30,606
Or go running back to Andhra.

1003
01:00:33,647 --> 01:00:35,231
Oh no!

1004
01:00:41,647 --> 01:00:43,189
They killed them!

1005
01:00:43,522 --> 01:00:47,106
They killed my son and husband.

1006
01:00:49,981 --> 01:00:52,272
They're dead!

1007
01:00:52,606 --> 01:00:54,022
They killed them!

1008
01:00:55,772 --> 01:00:58,064
Alas! What a tragedy!

1009
01:00:58,647 --> 01:01:01,189
Is there nobody who can stop him?

1010
01:01:02,064 --> 01:01:04,064
Does God exist where the devil does?

1011
01:01:04,272 --> 01:01:05,231
Of course.

1012
01:01:05,314 --> 01:01:07,814
God will save us.
Our God will save us.

1013
01:01:19,856 --> 01:01:23,772
I was looking for the Chennai project file
and dropped the UP file.

1014
01:01:24,522 --> 01:01:26,481
What's in that UP file? Give it to me..

1015
01:01:26,814 --> 01:01:28,147
Uncle!

1016
01:01:28,481 --> 01:01:30,981
If your mom knows I gave you
this file, she'll kill me.

1017
01:01:31,064 --> 01:01:32,981
Stop over acting and give it.
- No...

1018
01:01:39,981 --> 01:01:42,606
The same file that saved you
and led you here...

1019
01:01:42,939 --> 01:01:45,731
Is going to take you back
and risk your life.

1020
01:01:52,522 --> 01:01:55,522
So to summarize, this UP project
is very necessary for us.

1021
01:01:55,814 --> 01:01:57,314
It will help us all a lot.

1022
01:01:57,731 --> 01:02:00,356
This project can't stop at any cost.
- Arjun!

1023
01:02:00,647 --> 01:02:02,647
Who gave you the authority
to move the UP file?

1024
01:02:02,856 --> 01:02:04,647
What's wrong, mom? It's a good project.

1025
01:02:04,772 --> 01:02:08,106
It will bring us profits and provide
employment opportunities.

1026
01:02:08,272 --> 01:02:10,647
That's not important...
You are important to me.

1027
01:02:10,897 --> 01:02:12,731
Stop this project immediately!

1028
01:02:13,856 --> 01:02:16,106
- As the Chairman of this company...
- You got all rights.

1029
01:02:16,731 --> 01:02:19,064
- Except this project.
- But why?

1030
01:02:19,189 --> 01:02:21,606
No more arguments about
this project anymore.

1031
01:02:24,314 --> 01:02:26,314
Then I'll step down from
the Chairman post.

1032
01:02:26,606 --> 01:02:28,731
I'll resign right away and go abroad.

1033
01:02:28,856 --> 01:02:31,522
Arjun, stop!
If you find out what happened there...

1034
01:02:32,856 --> 01:02:33,981
What happened?

1035
01:02:39,981 --> 01:02:42,106
- Did you get the soil test done?
- Yes, ma'am.

1036
01:02:42,731 --> 01:02:44,981
- These fields aren't fertile, are they?
- No, ma'am.

1037
01:02:45,147 --> 01:02:47,481
You can start your project here, ma'am.

1038
01:03:15,939 --> 01:03:18,397
If you want to establish a Solar Power
Project in this area...

1039
01:03:18,606 --> 01:03:22,147
Minister Bhavaninath gets 30 percent share.

1040
01:03:22,314 --> 01:03:23,606
- For what?
- Shut up!

1041
01:03:23,939 --> 01:03:24,981
Not only that.

1042
01:03:25,147 --> 01:03:29,314
10 percent life long share in the profits
goes to his family.

1043
01:03:30,856 --> 01:03:32,897
Why should we bribe him? Huh?

1044
01:03:33,272 --> 01:03:34,981
This is the right place for our project.

1045
01:03:35,147 --> 01:03:39,189
We have permits from every department
as per Government laws.

1046
01:03:39,606 --> 01:03:42,397
Hey! The power generated here
will also go to the Government.

1047
01:03:42,439 --> 01:03:43,731
Ask them for a share.

1048
01:03:43,772 --> 01:03:45,522
You sidekick! Shut up!

1049
01:03:45,647 --> 01:03:47,481
How does he know I'm a sidekick?

1050
01:03:47,606 --> 01:03:48,981
I don't want to hear any of it.

1051
01:03:49,147 --> 01:03:51,147
You should listen to what I say.

1052
01:03:51,314 --> 01:03:52,647
Is that a threat?

1053
01:03:53,481 --> 01:03:55,606
- Durga Prasad, call the cops.
- Okay.

1054
01:04:00,731 --> 01:04:03,731
Are you threating me, huh?

1055
01:04:05,106 --> 01:04:07,856
I know Telugu people are so egoistic.

1056
01:04:08,231 --> 01:04:11,606
If you flaunt it in front of me,
you'll be dead.

1057
01:04:12,022 --> 01:04:16,606
If you're against it,
get the hell out of here.

1058
01:04:16,772 --> 01:04:18,606
Who do you think you're talking to?

1059
01:04:18,731 --> 01:04:20,189
Don't mess with me.

1060
01:04:25,189 --> 01:04:27,814
If you inaugurate the plant
against my will...

1061
01:04:27,981 --> 01:04:32,647
I'll kill you along with everyone else
and bury you right here.

1062
01:04:33,731 --> 01:04:35,272
How will you bury us, huh?

1063
01:04:42,189 --> 01:04:43,439
Beware!

1064
01:05:00,147 --> 01:05:02,439
That was the first time your mother
had an heart attack.

1065
01:05:02,647 --> 01:05:04,522
Why didn't you tell me about it back then?

1066
01:05:04,606 --> 01:05:06,314
That's when you fell under our car.

1067
01:05:06,481 --> 01:05:09,064
You were in the hospital f
rom a car accident.

1068
01:05:10,189 --> 01:05:11,606
That is what I was trying to say.

1069
01:05:11,731 --> 01:05:15,814
Organize the solar plant inauguration
in the same land.

1070
01:05:15,897 --> 01:05:18,022
- Why?
- It's not about our company anymore.

1071
01:05:18,397 --> 01:05:19,731
It's about my mother.

1072
01:05:20,147 --> 01:05:21,939
- Listen...
- No more arguments!

1073
01:05:22,939 --> 01:05:23,814
Arjun!

1074
01:05:24,064 --> 01:05:24,897
Arjun!

1075
01:05:25,022 --> 01:05:27,647
This inauguration will mark
the end of your life.

1076
01:05:27,939 --> 01:05:30,439
I'll take over the company then.

1077
01:05:33,772 --> 01:05:36,231
You're a highly powerful Central Minister.

1078
01:05:36,731 --> 01:05:38,731
Not as powerful as you.

1079
01:05:38,814 --> 01:05:42,147
Watch me speak at the All India
Minister's Meeting.

1080
01:05:42,356 --> 01:05:43,481
Of course, you will.

1081
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:46,189
- I'll shake the cabinet upside down.
- Right.

1082
01:05:46,439 --> 01:05:51,314
Even the PM should be startled
to hear Bhavaninath speak.

1083
01:05:51,397 --> 01:05:52,731
Yes. Yes.

1084
01:05:54,064 --> 01:05:55,439
Where's my phone?

1085
01:05:55,897 --> 01:05:58,064
Rogue!

1086
01:05:59,939 --> 01:06:01,147
Are you going to kill him?

1087
01:06:01,272 --> 01:06:02,439
Stop!

1088
01:06:04,106 --> 01:06:06,106
Why are you quiet, you loser?

1089
01:06:06,314 --> 01:06:07,814
Do you know who you're talking to?

1090
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:10,272
I'm talking to a street dog
called Bhavaninath!

1091
01:06:10,481 --> 01:06:12,481
You're talking to a Minister.

1092
01:06:12,606 --> 01:06:14,814
Like I would give a damn.

1093
01:06:17,064 --> 01:06:19,189
Hey! Who the hell are you?

1094
01:06:19,439 --> 01:06:21,814
Asian Group of Software Companies Chairman.

1095
01:06:21,897 --> 01:06:23,397
Mrs. Sarojini Prasad's only son.

1096
01:06:23,522 --> 01:06:26,897
This is Mr. Arjun Prasad speaking,
you fool!

1097
01:06:26,981 --> 01:06:28,106
Who are you calling a fool, huh?

1098
01:06:28,189 --> 01:06:32,481
You're the fool for raising
your hand on a woman.

1099
01:06:32,731 --> 01:06:33,897
Hey!!!

1100
01:06:34,481 --> 01:06:36,814
You got lucky that I'm in Delhi.

1101
01:06:37,022 --> 01:06:39,772
You're cussing me over the phone
and taking pleasure in it.

1102
01:06:39,856 --> 01:06:43,647
If I had met you the day
I found out you assaulted my mother...

1103
01:06:43,731 --> 01:06:45,606
You would've been dead for 4 days now.

1104
01:06:48,272 --> 01:06:50,231
The place you assaulted my mother...

1105
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:54,356
Will be the same place the solar plant
will be inaugurated at.

1106
01:06:54,606 --> 01:06:56,356
I dare you to try and stop it.

1107
01:06:56,731 --> 01:06:59,939
Watch me turn the tables in some time.

1108
01:07:00,272 --> 01:07:02,522
Come on! I'll be waiting.

1109
01:07:02,731 --> 01:07:05,356
You can't even touch me
in this lifetime.

1110
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:09,064
Want to know what I'm made of? Huh?

1111
01:07:15,106 --> 01:07:16,897
It's not the sound from the bore.

1112
01:07:17,064 --> 01:07:19,189
It's the sound of death welcoming you.

1113
01:07:19,356 --> 01:07:20,272
Come on!

1114
01:07:25,272 --> 01:07:26,939
I'm scared for him.

1115
01:07:27,106 --> 01:07:28,064
Me too.

1116
01:07:28,147 --> 01:07:29,314
Don't be scared...

1117
01:07:29,397 --> 01:07:32,981
Watch the lion roar louder
as its prey walks by.

1118
01:07:33,064 --> 01:07:34,231
Lion?!

1119
01:07:35,731 --> 01:07:37,356
Hey, Venkatesh. Why did the work stop?

1120
01:07:37,439 --> 01:07:39,939
- Maybe there's a rock blocking it, sir.
- Then plant a bomb and blast the rock.

1121
01:07:39,981 --> 01:07:40,981
Okay, sir.

1122
01:07:41,106 --> 01:07:42,106
Hey!

1123
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:50,272
If the inauguration goes well by God's grace...

1124
01:07:50,356 --> 01:07:53,147
I want to host your engagement soon.

1125
01:07:53,272 --> 01:07:55,064
Oh. Is It going to take time?

1126
01:07:55,147 --> 01:07:57,064
I thought you'd do it today.

1127
01:07:57,106 --> 01:07:59,022
So I came all dressed up.

1128
01:07:59,231 --> 01:08:00,314
Wait.

1129
01:08:00,356 --> 01:08:02,022
Let's hope the inauguration goes well.

1130
01:08:02,231 --> 01:08:05,397
We never know what's coming at us.
- You're always imagining the worst.

1131
01:08:05,606 --> 01:08:07,772
- Shut up!
- Mom, what are you doing there?

1132
01:08:07,939 --> 01:08:09,064
Join the ritual.

1133
01:08:09,231 --> 01:08:11,647
It's for you.
You should be a part of it.

1134
01:08:11,772 --> 01:08:14,022
Uh-huh. Who will get the work done then?

1135
01:08:14,147 --> 01:08:15,856
I should keep an eye on everyone.

1136
01:08:19,064 --> 01:08:21,731
Why are you standing there like a scarecrow?

1137
01:08:21,897 --> 01:08:23,147
Give them the flowers.

1138
01:08:23,647 --> 01:08:25,064
What are you staring at me?

1139
01:08:25,897 --> 01:08:27,189
What's so special?

1140
01:08:27,856 --> 01:08:29,314
Who the hell are you?

1141
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:33,647
Don't tell me you planted bombs
around here.

1142
01:08:33,939 --> 01:08:35,731
Huh? Answer me.

1143
01:08:36,522 --> 01:08:38,397
Hey! Stop!

1144
01:08:39,147 --> 01:08:40,189
Stop right there!

1145
01:08:40,981 --> 01:08:42,856
Hey, you!

1146
01:08:43,522 --> 01:08:44,731
Stop!

1147
01:08:45,647 --> 01:08:46,856
Stop!

1148
01:08:52,814 --> 01:08:54,022
Arjun!

1149
01:08:54,939 --> 01:08:56,814
Hey, Arjun Prasad!

1150
01:09:00,106 --> 01:09:03,814
You cussed the Minister so badly
for assaulting your mother.

1151
01:09:04,022 --> 01:09:07,147
I'm going to burn your mom's face now.

1152
01:09:08,189 --> 01:09:09,939
What the hell are you going to do?

1153
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:11,314
Come on!

1154
01:09:45,606 --> 01:09:47,314
Kill him, guys!

1155
01:09:48,731 --> 01:09:50,064
Are you fine?

1156
01:10:10,106 --> 01:10:12,439
I warned you against taking up
this project.

1157
01:10:12,606 --> 01:10:14,314
Look what it has led to.

1158
01:10:15,314 --> 01:10:18,606
Look... They're flying off the ground
like dust.

1159
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:36,064
Priests!

1160
01:10:36,606 --> 01:10:40,272
No matter whose limbs fall off...

1161
01:10:41,064 --> 01:10:43,647
No matter how much bloodshed is caused...

1162
01:10:44,481 --> 01:10:46,481
The ritual can't stop.

1163
01:10:46,939 --> 01:10:48,439
Start chanting.

1164
01:13:12,731 --> 01:13:16,272
This Telugu man proved to be a horror
in UP people's lives, huh?

1165
01:13:43,647 --> 01:13:44,731
Hey!

1166
01:13:44,981 --> 01:13:46,272
Come on!

1167
01:13:46,939 --> 01:13:49,022
All of you charge together.

1168
01:14:36,272 --> 01:14:37,856
Hey, Dharma!

1169
01:14:49,731 --> 01:14:50,856
Dharma?!

1170
01:14:53,022 --> 01:14:54,481
Who's Dharma?

1171
01:14:56,555 --> 01:14:58,347
You've abandoned us.

1172
01:14:58,430 --> 01:15:01,555
Ever since you left, there was
no one to show us some concern.

1173
01:15:01,764 --> 01:15:05,805
We lost our lands and homes
after we lost you.

1174
01:15:05,889 --> 01:15:08,180
The entire village is in ruins.

1175
01:15:08,305 --> 01:15:11,014
We were the owners of our land...
Now we're working as labor.

1176
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:12,555
Don't you recognize me?

1177
01:15:12,639 --> 01:15:13,889
It's me. Kittayya.

1178
01:15:14,014 --> 01:15:15,764
Sir, this is Subbayya.

1179
01:15:15,930 --> 01:15:17,014
I'm Narsayya.

1180
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:18,805
It's me. Seenayya.

1181
01:15:19,264 --> 01:15:21,014
Stop it! I said stop it!

1182
01:15:21,264 --> 01:15:26,555
He didn't recognize his mother,
sister or father.

1183
01:15:26,764 --> 01:15:29,055
He didn't even recognize the girl
he fell in love with.

1184
01:15:29,389 --> 01:15:30,930
How do you expect him to recognize
you people?

1185
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:32,764
He's not our Dharma anymore.

1186
01:15:33,222 --> 01:15:35,180
He's the heir to a celebrated family,
who looks just like Dharma.

1187
01:15:35,639 --> 01:15:37,889
How can Dharma possibly come back
when he's dead?

1188
01:15:38,764 --> 01:15:40,222
My apologies to you.

1189
01:15:40,514 --> 01:15:43,055
We trouble you assuming you
were my son.

1190
01:15:43,555 --> 01:15:44,889
Please get on with your business.

1191
01:15:45,055 --> 01:15:45,889
We'll leave.

1192
01:15:46,764 --> 01:15:48,389
Let's go, everyone.

1193
01:15:51,055 --> 01:15:52,139
Come on, dear.

1194
01:15:53,014 --> 01:15:54,222
Let's go from here.
This place is not lucky for us.

1195
01:15:54,347 --> 01:15:56,180
Hold on. Wait.

1196
01:15:58,264 --> 01:16:03,764
So, you said your son Dharma
looks exactly like our Chairman.

1197
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,055
Who killed him?

1198
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:08,055
We said our son is no more.

1199
01:16:08,389 --> 01:16:09,764
We never mentioned anything about
somebody killing him.

1200
01:16:10,014 --> 01:16:11,305
Why are you curious anyway?

1201
01:16:12,014 --> 01:16:14,180
Hey! Learn to keep your mouth shut.

1202
01:16:14,764 --> 01:16:17,472
Listen, If we find out who's
responsible for Dharma's death...

1203
01:16:17,764 --> 01:16:19,805
We can be cautious.
That is why I ask.

1204
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:22,347
No one would dare to kill my son.

1205
01:16:23,347 --> 01:16:27,805
He's the guiding light to not just my family
but also everyone here.

1206
01:16:28,847 --> 01:16:30,930
Dharma is our saviour.

1207
01:16:31,347 --> 01:16:34,014
He stands by us in times of crisis.

1208
01:16:37,555 --> 01:16:39,639
We won't sell anymore. No chance!

1209
01:16:40,055 --> 01:16:41,805
Stop it! Stop!

1210
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:44,555
There's no point shouting...

1211
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,847
Look. It's the harvest this semester.

1212
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:48,305
We can't sell it at half price.

1213
01:16:48,472 --> 01:16:50,639
You can buy at our terms or leave.

1214
01:16:50,805 --> 01:16:53,847
You guys came here from Telugu states
to earn a living.

1215
01:16:53,930 --> 01:16:55,222
How dare you stand against us!

1216
01:16:55,472 --> 01:16:58,139
You must sell it at the price
Thakur's quote.

1217
01:16:58,305 --> 01:17:02,014
Or else, we'll make sure your paddy is unsold
at all the markets.

1218
01:17:02,264 --> 01:17:04,639
We don't mind losing dealers...
But we can't get into losses.

1219
01:17:04,889 --> 01:17:07,639
We'll preserve the paddy and sell it
when the prices rise.

1220
01:17:07,764 --> 01:17:09,305
What the hells are you saying?

1221
01:17:09,514 --> 01:17:11,639
You were in torn clothes when you
first came here.

1222
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:13,472
You're living on the Government's aid now.

1223
01:17:13,555 --> 01:17:16,305
Just because your lives are decent now,
doesn't mean you go against us.

1224
01:17:16,389 --> 01:17:19,930
Hey! You were also a nobody
when we first came here.

1225
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:25,472
You know who a farmer is?

1226
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,555
A beggar seeking alms from
the land and skies.

1227
01:17:27,639 --> 01:17:28,847
You're all beggars!

1228
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:30,889
How dare you question us!

1229
01:17:31,805 --> 01:17:33,264
Burn all the paddy, guys!

1230
01:17:33,389 --> 01:17:36,055
Stop it! No! Don't do it!

1231
01:17:43,764 --> 01:17:45,889
Whom are you calling?
Fire Engine?

1232
01:17:46,014 --> 01:17:48,347
No. I'm actually calling a ‘Fireball'.

1233
01:17:48,389 --> 01:17:49,264
‘Fireball', huh?

1234
01:17:49,555 --> 01:17:50,639
Who is it?

1235
01:17:50,805 --> 01:17:51,639
Our brother.

1236
01:17:51,805 --> 01:17:53,014
You have to take the trouble
of starting a fire.

1237
01:17:53,222 --> 01:17:54,930
But he's got fire within him.

1238
01:17:55,014 --> 01:17:55,930
Fire, huh?

1239
01:17:56,555 --> 01:17:58,430
Drag them out of here.

1240
01:18:00,472 --> 01:18:02,430
I want all the paddy to end up in smoke.

1241
01:18:17,514 --> 01:18:19,430
Didn't you learn your lesson?

1242
01:18:19,555 --> 01:18:21,139
Why'd you drag your arrogant selves
back here?

1243
01:18:21,347 --> 01:18:22,764
Who instilled this courage in you?

1244
01:18:22,805 --> 01:18:23,847
Dharma...

1245
01:18:24,055 --> 01:18:25,764
My son Dharma!

1246
01:18:36,055 --> 01:18:38,305
Oh. A cop, huh?

1247
01:18:38,555 --> 01:18:40,222
I'm not here on duty...

1248
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,264
I'm a farmer's son now.

1249
01:19:09,014 --> 01:19:10,347
What did you say farmers were?

1250
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:14,014
Beggars seeking alms from
the land and skies.

1251
01:19:19,472 --> 01:19:20,555
What happened?

1252
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:22,430
Why is my nose bleeding?

1253
01:19:22,639 --> 01:19:23,847
He hit you, bro.

1254
01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:25,680
When?

1255
01:19:25,764 --> 01:19:28,139
The very second you called them beggars.

1256
01:19:36,014 --> 01:19:38,847
How dare you attack farmers!

1257
01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:40,347
Crook!

1258
01:19:41,139 --> 01:19:44,014
People can live without a cellphone.

1259
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:47,014
And its inventor is a billionaire.

1260
01:19:47,472 --> 01:19:51,430
People can live without alcohol.

1261
01:19:51,764 --> 01:19:54,139
Its manufacturer is also a billionaire.

1262
01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:56,639
The tobacco we smoke...

1263
01:19:57,014 --> 01:19:58,430
People can live without it...

1264
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:00,680
Its manufacturer is a billionaire too.

1265
01:20:01,389 --> 01:20:05,555
But do you possibly think we can
live without food?

1266
01:20:05,805 --> 01:20:06,639
No, right?

1267
01:20:07,805 --> 01:20:11,555
But the farmers who produce food
are living like beggars.

1268
01:20:12,139 --> 01:20:13,055
Who's responsible?

1269
01:20:13,305 --> 01:20:14,889
Because of dogs like you.

1270
01:20:15,014 --> 01:20:16,639
How dare you call me a dog!

1271
01:20:29,222 --> 01:20:31,139
What do you even know about
Telugu farmers?

1272
01:20:31,264 --> 01:20:38,139
It's their blood and sweat that transformed
barren lands into crop fields.

1273
01:20:38,389 --> 01:20:44,930
You don't know their struggle,
for they water the crop with tears.

1274
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:54,430
They've irrigated the Durgam forest.

1275
01:20:54,639 --> 01:21:00,764
Our farmers they've sustained extreme
weather conditions to cultivate crop

1276
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:03,389
in gray vegetation areas.

1277
01:21:11,472 --> 01:21:14,472
Walking through thorn forests
with plows on their shoulder...

1278
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:16,139
Surviving the fear of wild animals...

1279
01:21:16,305 --> 01:21:18,139
Seeking shelter alongside reptiles
in the woods...

1280
01:21:18,222 --> 01:21:20,014
Enduring the pain from scorpion bites...

1281
01:21:20,222 --> 01:21:21,764
Putting their lives at risk...

1282
01:21:21,889 --> 01:21:23,764
Irrigating lands day in and day out...

1283
01:21:23,805 --> 01:21:29,472
They produce crop that feeds the world.

1284
01:21:29,514 --> 01:21:31,639
How dare you raise your hand on them!

1285
01:21:31,805 --> 01:21:33,139
You crook!

1286
01:22:50,764 --> 01:22:53,222
If consumers like you are full of pride...

1287
01:22:53,389 --> 01:22:58,222
Imagine the kind of power and pride
farmers have.

1288
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:44,930
We'll buy at the prices you quote.

1289
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:50,222
We'll compensate for the burnt paddy bags.

1290
01:23:50,305 --> 01:23:51,889
Forgive us!

1291
01:24:28,472 --> 01:24:29,764
Are you Mr. Sita Ramayya?

1292
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:31,639
Yes... Who are you, dear?

1293
01:24:31,764 --> 01:24:32,847
Your daughter-in-law.

1294
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:34,180
Put it there.

1295
01:24:44,222 --> 01:24:45,139
Hello!

1296
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:48,889
Are you Mrs. Vanajakshi?

1297
01:24:49,180 --> 01:24:50,055
Yes.

1298
01:24:50,764 --> 01:24:51,555
Who are you?

1299
01:24:52,472 --> 01:24:53,764
Your daughter-in-law.

1300
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:55,764
I don't speak English.

1301
01:24:56,055 --> 01:24:57,264
Oh my god!

1302
01:24:57,555 --> 01:24:59,139
You're my ‘Atha' (mother-in-law).

1303
01:25:00,222 --> 01:25:01,139
Mother-in-law?

1304
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:05,639
Dad, who is she?

1305
01:25:08,347 --> 01:25:11,180
- Who are you?
- Hello! She's my daughter.

1306
01:25:12,139 --> 01:25:13,180
Oh!

1307
01:25:13,555 --> 01:25:14,930
That makes you my sister-in-law.

1308
01:25:15,055 --> 01:25:16,680
- Where are you going?
- College.

1309
01:25:16,847 --> 01:25:18,055
You've studied enough...

1310
01:25:18,347 --> 01:25:22,055
We'll find the right match for you and
get you married next January.

1311
01:25:22,555 --> 01:25:25,055
You look after the house chores...
Your husband will do the farming bit.

1312
01:25:25,139 --> 01:25:27,139
But me and my wife take care of that.

1313
01:25:27,764 --> 01:25:29,430
- Who's your wife?
- Me!

1314
01:25:29,847 --> 01:25:30,764
Oh!

1315
01:25:30,930 --> 01:25:35,180
Maids should stick to the verandah
or backyard.

1316
01:25:35,472 --> 01:25:38,139
What are you doing in the living room
when it's none of your business?

1317
01:25:38,347 --> 01:25:39,389
Whoaaa!!!

1318
01:25:40,055 --> 01:25:41,305
Oh my god!

1319
01:25:41,639 --> 01:25:44,055
You're stretching a single word
like chewing gum.

1320
01:25:45,514 --> 01:25:47,014
What are you looking at, huh?

1321
01:25:47,430 --> 01:25:48,347
Which way is East?

1322
01:25:48,514 --> 01:25:49,847
- This way.
- Hmm. Come with me.

1323
01:25:50,139 --> 01:25:51,930
- Why?
- Just come with me.

1324
01:25:52,305 --> 01:25:53,264
Come on.

1325
01:25:54,514 --> 01:25:56,639
I want your couple to bless me.

1326
01:25:56,764 --> 01:25:58,680
What are we blessing you for?

1327
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:00,639
What's the next step after marriage?

1328
01:26:01,555 --> 01:26:02,430
Children.

1329
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:04,389
Bless me for that.

1330
01:26:05,014 --> 01:26:06,847
‘May God bless with you children.'
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

1331
01:26:07,347 --> 01:26:09,930
Blessing for an unmarried girl?

1332
01:26:10,139 --> 01:26:12,764
Hey, Subbarao! It's been so long.

1333
01:26:13,430 --> 01:26:14,139
Please come.

1334
01:26:14,305 --> 01:26:16,264
- How is everyone doing?
- We're doing fine.

1335
01:26:16,930 --> 01:26:18,055
I get it now.

1336
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:19,889
- She's your daughter, right?
- Yes, brother.

1337
01:26:20,014 --> 01:26:21,930
She wanted to surprise you.

1338
01:26:22,847 --> 01:26:25,555
It seemed more like a fuss fest.

1339
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:29,347
That is why she asked us to wait
in the car for 10 minutes.

1340
01:26:29,472 --> 01:26:31,014
I haven't seen you in so long.

1341
01:26:31,139 --> 01:26:33,139
My soon-to-be daughter-in-law
has changed so much.

1342
01:26:33,264 --> 01:26:35,014
Dad, don't draw conclusions yet.

1343
01:26:35,139 --> 01:26:38,514
My brother should like her first.

1344
01:26:38,764 --> 01:26:40,347
Why wouldn't your brother like this beauty?

1345
01:26:40,847 --> 01:26:41,639
Where is he?

1346
01:26:41,764 --> 01:26:44,014
Look around the house.
You'll find him somewhere.

1347
01:26:44,555 --> 01:26:45,680
I will find him. Watch me!

1348
01:26:45,889 --> 01:26:46,514
Oh, yeah?

1349
01:26:46,805 --> 01:26:49,180
We should get my daughter
and your son married.

1350
01:26:49,264 --> 01:26:50,222
I would love that.

1351
01:26:50,430 --> 01:26:53,139
But he doesn't want to get married
before his sister.

1352
01:26:53,305 --> 01:26:54,930
He always has something to say.

1353
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:58,847
My son called from America...
My daughter-in-law is carrying.

1354
01:26:59,014 --> 01:27:01,139
We might not be back for a long time
once we visit them.

1355
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:04,139
Can my daughter move here till then?

1356
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:07,139
I'll treat her like my own daughter.

1357
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:08,472
You don't worry about it.

1358
01:27:10,264 --> 01:27:11,389
You're a sweetheart.

1359
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:13,680
Have you got rum by any chance?

1360
01:27:13,764 --> 01:27:15,680
- Let's open it.
- Bring it on.

1361
01:27:23,472 --> 01:27:24,639
Hello, Mister!

1362
01:27:30,139 --> 01:27:33,014
Aren't cops supposed to have
some code for hair?

1363
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:34,680
It's for a ritual.

1364
01:27:34,847 --> 01:27:36,930
I think you look handsome.

1365
01:27:37,764 --> 01:27:40,889
Look at me and tell me
if I look beautiful.

1366
01:27:41,139 --> 01:27:42,764
I don't think it's decent.

1367
01:27:42,889 --> 01:27:47,764
I don't want you commenting on
my flaws after marriage.

1368
01:27:48,139 --> 01:27:48,764
Hmm.

1369
01:27:48,805 --> 01:27:51,555
Tell me which body part you're not
so excited about.

1370
01:27:51,889 --> 01:27:53,639
I'll get surgery done.

1371
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:55,764
Now take a good look.

1372
01:27:56,389 --> 01:27:57,555
From top to bottom.

1373
01:28:00,847 --> 01:28:02,180
Your words are making me wet.

1374
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:04,347
- Who are you?
- Making you wet, as in?

1375
01:28:04,555 --> 01:28:06,930
I meant you're making me sweat.

1376
01:28:07,014 --> 01:28:10,222
First wipe your face and look at my waist.

1377
01:28:10,764 --> 01:28:12,139
That is what's making me sweat.

1378
01:28:12,222 --> 01:28:14,305
- So you're totally okay with me?
- Yeah, okay.

1379
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:17,014
Psst! You're not at all a romantic person.

1380
01:28:17,514 --> 01:28:19,014
There's a flowerpot right beside you.

1381
01:28:19,555 --> 01:28:22,514
Why don't you give me a flower
and propose?

1382
01:28:26,389 --> 01:28:28,014
Oh my god!

1383
01:28:28,264 --> 01:28:29,555
What's happening here?

1384
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:31,847
He thinks I'm beautiful.

1385
01:28:32,014 --> 01:28:33,764
That is why he's proposing.

1386
01:28:33,889 --> 01:28:36,180
Will you be marrying him or my brother?

1387
01:28:37,389 --> 01:28:39,805
- Isn't he your brother?
- No!

1388
01:28:41,389 --> 01:28:43,389
He's a constable working under my brother.

1389
01:28:43,555 --> 01:28:45,680
He's been living with us for free.

1390
01:28:46,055 --> 01:28:47,305
Oh my god!

1391
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:48,889
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1392
01:28:49,264 --> 01:28:51,847
Sorry. I mistook you for someone else.

1393
01:28:52,555 --> 01:28:57,014
Please forget whatever I showed you.

1394
01:28:57,139 --> 01:28:58,180
How do you think I can do that?

1395
01:28:58,305 --> 01:29:00,472
You got excited and left me drooling.

1396
01:29:00,847 --> 01:29:02,930
I'll need a long time to recover from this.

1397
01:29:04,555 --> 01:29:05,347
Yewww!

1398
01:29:07,305 --> 01:29:09,764
That bullet sound is a signal that
my brother's here.

1399
01:29:10,014 --> 01:29:10,805
Really?

1400
01:29:25,805 --> 01:29:27,514
Who is this beauty?

1401
01:29:32,930 --> 01:29:33,847
Yuck!

1402
01:29:34,764 --> 01:29:36,139
Something is wrong.

1403
01:29:36,347 --> 01:29:37,847
Did you like my brother?

1404
01:29:39,222 --> 01:29:40,639
His face is covered in dung.

1405
01:29:40,764 --> 01:29:42,180
You can see after he cleans his face.

1406
01:29:42,514 --> 01:29:44,180
Who is this beauty?

1407
01:29:44,764 --> 01:29:46,889
Hey! I didn't do anything.

1408
01:29:48,764 --> 01:29:51,347
Even dung doesn't stink when I look at her.
She's so beautiful.

1409
01:29:51,430 --> 01:29:52,514
Who is this beauty?

1410
01:29:52,639 --> 01:29:54,680
- She's going to be my brother's wife.
- Oh, really?

1411
01:29:54,764 --> 01:29:56,930
Hey! Sankranthi festival is near.

1412
01:29:57,014 --> 01:29:59,014
Go change the bulb in the backyard.

1413
01:29:59,180 --> 01:30:01,222
- Oh.
- First clean your face.

1414
01:30:02,139 --> 01:30:05,639
Hey! I'm scared of electricity...
Hold properly.

1415
01:30:05,764 --> 01:30:06,764
Okay. Climb on.

1416
01:30:07,014 --> 01:30:08,347
Please try to understand.

1417
01:30:08,555 --> 01:30:09,764
I don't want this marriage.

1418
01:30:09,930 --> 01:30:12,514
What changed all of a sudden?

1419
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:15,680
Constable looks better than
the Circle Inspector.

1420
01:30:15,764 --> 01:30:17,347
What the hell are you talking about?

1421
01:30:17,639 --> 01:30:19,389
Why is the bulb on without connection?

1422
01:30:19,472 --> 01:30:22,472
I can't lose my friendship though
you like it or not.

1423
01:30:22,847 --> 01:30:25,264
I promised him this marriage will happen.

1424
01:30:25,639 --> 01:30:28,389
This is where you have to live
for the rest of your life.

1425
01:30:29,180 --> 01:30:32,805
In that case, I'll marry the constable
and live here as a maid.

1426
01:30:32,889 --> 01:30:34,389
- Sandhya!
- I love you!

1427
01:31:04,555 --> 01:31:08,055
"Tulsi, Narsamma, Girija and Geeta..."

1428
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:10,264
"We've got a good harvest"

1429
01:31:11,305 --> 01:31:16,972
"It's time for a celebration
when the produces reaches home"

1430
01:31:18,347 --> 01:31:21,805
"This harvest is pure gold in our abode"

1431
01:31:22,014 --> 01:31:25,430
"Our homes pave welcome
with flower decorations"

1432
01:31:25,555 --> 01:31:28,222
"It's all about the hard work over a year"

1433
01:31:28,389 --> 01:31:30,097
"We're fortunate to have such a blessing"

1434
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:32,222
"Let's dance in joy"

1435
01:31:33,014 --> 01:31:36,222
"Sankranthi festival is here"

1436
01:31:36,347 --> 01:31:39,764
"It brings the festivities"

1437
01:31:40,014 --> 01:31:43,347
"Makara Sankranthi festival is here"

1438
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:46,847
"It brings a life of colors and smiles"

1439
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:12,680
"No matter where you are in the world"

1440
01:32:12,805 --> 01:32:17,014
"Telugu people always prove their worth"

1441
01:32:17,555 --> 01:32:22,555
"Telugu people always prove their worth"

1442
01:32:24,264 --> 01:32:31,347
"Agriculture is one of our oldest heritage"

1443
01:32:31,889 --> 01:32:37,639
"We might grow heights
but we're forever grounded"

1444
01:32:38,597 --> 01:32:41,889
"Makara Sankranthi festival is here"

1445
01:32:42,139 --> 01:32:45,514
"It brings a life of colors and smiles"

1446
01:32:45,639 --> 01:32:48,930
"Makara Sankranthi festival is here"

1447
01:32:49,055 --> 01:32:52,680
"It brings a life of colors and smiles"

1448
01:33:00,139 --> 01:33:03,180
"Worship Goddess Gowri with flowers"

1449
01:33:03,264 --> 01:33:06,764
"Let's pray together to make
our lives better"

1450
01:33:06,805 --> 01:33:10,222
"All your desires will come true"

1451
01:33:10,347 --> 01:33:13,889
"The man of your dreams will marry you"

1452
01:33:35,889 --> 01:33:42,347
"Farmer becomes our savior
by producing food"

1453
01:33:43,014 --> 01:33:48,055
"The world will prosper only
when farmers progress"

1454
01:33:49,514 --> 01:33:56,514
"These villages teach us that
kindness matters"

1455
01:33:57,222 --> 01:34:03,430
"Hope we are blessed with good times to come"

1456
01:34:04,847 --> 01:34:08,847
"Makara Sankranthi festival is here"

1457
01:34:09,014 --> 01:34:12,639
"It brings a life of colors and smiles"

1458
01:34:12,805 --> 01:34:16,097
"Makara Sankranthi festival is here"

1459
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:20,014
"It brings a life of colors and smiles"

1460
01:35:00,655 --> 01:35:01,530
Hello.

1461
01:35:04,322 --> 01:35:05,155
Please come.

1462
01:35:07,697 --> 01:35:08,363
Hello.

1463
01:35:08,697 --> 01:35:10,780
What's going on, Thakur?
- Please come in. I'll tell you.

1464
01:35:10,905 --> 01:35:12,947
You've invited all the Thakurs.
Is it your birthday?

1465
01:35:13,072 --> 01:35:14,447
No. Come in and I'll let you know.

1466
01:35:14,988 --> 01:35:15,988
Go inside.

1467
01:35:18,530 --> 01:35:19,572
Hello, everyone!

1468
01:35:20,363 --> 01:35:22,697
I worked as the Agricultural Minister
at one point of time.

1469
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:26,863
My brother Bhavaninath Thakur
is the Revenue Minister.

1470
01:35:27,572 --> 01:35:30,572
Though people are the reason our family
is bestowed with such prosperity...

1471
01:35:30,697 --> 01:35:32,030
The matter of the fact is...

1472
01:35:32,238 --> 01:35:35,655
This wouldn't have been possible without
the blessings of the Thakur family.

1473
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:40,447
Today...

1474
01:35:40,905 --> 01:35:43,655
I hope for you to bless
my daughter as well.

1475
01:35:44,613 --> 01:35:45,572
Is she ready? Call her.

1476
01:35:45,738 --> 01:35:46,947
Is it your daughter's birthday?

1477
01:35:47,155 --> 01:35:48,613
It's three months later.

1478
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:50,947
He's been looking for a groom
for quite some time now.

1479
01:35:51,155 --> 01:35:52,363
I guess the wedding is fixed now.

1480
01:35:52,697 --> 01:35:54,197
Am I right, Mr. Thakur?

1481
01:36:07,113 --> 01:36:08,238
You don't have to touch my feet.

1482
01:36:08,405 --> 01:36:09,738
Get on to the dais first.

1483
01:36:14,988 --> 01:36:15,947
Come on...

1484
01:36:16,113 --> 01:36:17,572
Greetings, everyone.

1485
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:22,238
Please sit.

1486
01:36:24,072 --> 01:36:25,697
We didn't finalize this marriage.

1487
01:36:26,572 --> 01:36:27,822
They made the decision for themselves.

1488
01:36:28,488 --> 01:36:29,447
I had to oblige.

1489
01:36:29,863 --> 01:36:32,780
My daughter hasn't done anything
without my permission.

1490
01:36:33,697 --> 01:36:35,780
But she chose a groom for herself.

1491
01:36:36,530 --> 01:36:38,238
I was really angry at first.

1492
01:36:39,030 --> 01:36:41,655
So they eloped and got married.

1493
01:36:42,238 --> 01:36:44,863
But my brother consoled me...

1494
01:36:45,113 --> 01:36:47,197
Found them, brought them
back home and said...

1495
01:36:47,655 --> 01:36:51,697
‘Brother, let's have a grand reception
for the Thakur family.'

1496
01:36:52,072 --> 01:36:53,072
That is why you're all here today.

1497
01:36:53,197 --> 01:36:54,947
So, what's the groom's caste?

1498
01:36:56,488 --> 01:36:58,072
He's from a different caste.

1499
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:59,405
What do you mean different caste?

1500
01:36:59,655 --> 01:37:00,822
Is he below us?

1501
01:37:01,197 --> 01:37:02,905
Who cares about caste in this
modern world?

1502
01:37:03,113 --> 01:37:05,447
Arranged marriages might soon be
a thing of the past.

1503
01:37:05,655 --> 01:37:07,197
Aren't you ashamed?

1504
01:37:07,905 --> 01:37:09,780
She married a guy of the lower caste.

1505
01:37:09,905 --> 01:37:11,780
How could she possibly expect us
to bless her?

1506
01:37:12,738 --> 01:37:14,947
Mamaji, don't leave. Please wait.

1507
01:37:15,113 --> 01:37:16,488
I've had enough.

1508
01:37:16,655 --> 01:37:19,072
Mamaji, listen to me. Don't leave.

1509
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:20,530
Mamaji!

1510
01:37:20,780 --> 01:37:21,405
Brother...

1511
01:37:22,030 --> 01:37:23,405
You bless them first.

1512
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:24,780
Come on.

1513
01:37:25,697 --> 01:37:26,572
Give me that.

1514
01:37:28,238 --> 01:37:31,113
Our son-in-law is not a loser
like you all assumed.

1515
01:37:31,447 --> 01:37:32,822
He's like a lion!

1516
01:37:33,072 --> 01:37:34,905
They're married for 4 months now.

1517
01:37:35,238 --> 01:37:37,572
And she's already pregnant for 3 months.

1518
01:37:46,238 --> 01:37:48,030
Son-in-law, open your mouth.

1519
01:37:56,947 --> 01:37:59,072
This is why I hosted this party.

1520
01:37:59,155 --> 01:38:03,322
So that I could kill you
in front of everyone.

1521
01:38:03,447 --> 01:38:04,488
Bhavani!

1522
01:38:04,655 --> 01:38:07,363
Hey! Your daughter deserves to die first.

1523
01:38:07,447 --> 01:38:08,905
Brother!

1524
01:38:12,530 --> 01:38:13,613
Hey, Thakur!

1525
01:38:17,863 --> 01:38:21,030
Don't spare anyone belonging to his caste.

1526
01:38:21,197 --> 01:38:22,655
Kill everyone!

1527
01:38:23,322 --> 01:38:24,488
Catch him, guys.

1528
01:38:27,072 --> 01:38:29,363
My brother's daughter can't be
alive either.

1529
01:38:29,572 --> 01:38:30,613
Kill her as well.

1530
01:38:34,238 --> 01:38:35,405
Where are they?

1531
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:41,280
They can't escape this palace so quickly.

1532
01:38:41,530 --> 01:38:45,572
Kill that other caste baby
she's carrying as well.

1533
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:48,697
Don't hesitate to kill my brother
if he comes in the way.

1534
01:38:48,863 --> 01:38:49,905
Okay, brother.

1535
01:38:59,613 --> 01:39:03,238
Wow! I missed such a wonderful spectacle.

1536
01:39:03,447 --> 01:39:04,530
You're super, Bhavani!

1537
01:39:04,655 --> 01:39:06,447
You're our caste's leader
from now on.

1538
01:39:06,530 --> 01:39:08,530
This was a lesson to everyone
in the Thakur family.

1539
01:39:08,655 --> 01:39:11,072
This will go down in history.

1540
01:39:11,738 --> 01:39:16,030
Guys from other castes wouldn't even
dare to come near girls from our caste.

1541
01:39:16,363 --> 01:39:17,322
Cheers, man.

1542
01:39:18,613 --> 01:39:20,155
Hail Bhavaninath Thakur!

1543
01:39:20,447 --> 01:39:22,322
Hail Bhavaninath Thakur!

1544
01:39:23,655 --> 01:39:25,280
Hey! Hey! Stop!

1545
01:39:28,613 --> 01:39:30,822
Open the door. Hurry up.

1546
01:39:33,447 --> 01:39:35,822
Be strong, dear. It's going to be fine.

1547
01:39:36,863 --> 01:39:39,738
Let me go, dad. I'll die.

1548
01:39:39,863 --> 01:39:41,488
Please don't say that, my love.

1549
01:39:42,405 --> 01:39:43,488
Open it.

1550
01:39:43,822 --> 01:39:44,697
Open the damn door!

1551
01:39:45,905 --> 01:39:48,197
Hello, sir. This is Virendranath speaking.

1552
01:39:52,322 --> 01:39:54,113
Sir, how can you say that?

1553
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:55,280
Cheers!!!

1554
01:40:00,530 --> 01:40:01,988
Play some music!

1555
01:40:09,030 --> 01:40:10,947
Everyone is scared of him.

1556
01:40:22,947 --> 01:40:23,738
Father!

1557
01:42:53,780 --> 01:42:56,780
Guys, I arranged a grand feast for everyone.

1558
01:42:56,947 --> 01:42:58,613
Eat to your satisfaction.

1559
01:43:00,113 --> 01:43:01,988
Come on. Get into the van.

1560
01:43:02,863 --> 01:43:06,405
Hey! You think you can arrest
Bhavaninath Thakur?

1561
01:43:06,613 --> 01:43:07,822
Don't you want to live?

1562
01:43:08,030 --> 01:43:08,822
Hey!

1563
01:43:09,488 --> 01:43:10,155
Hey!

1564
01:43:11,488 --> 01:43:12,113
Hey!

1565
01:43:15,447 --> 01:43:19,155
This gun and the bullets in it know
nothing about castes.

1566
01:43:20,155 --> 01:43:22,780
They will shoot right through
anyone's heads.

1567
01:43:23,988 --> 01:43:25,697
What's up with the whole Thakur image?

1568
01:43:26,822 --> 01:43:30,947
Did you decide to be born into this family?

1569
01:43:32,322 --> 01:43:34,363
Bloody caste maniacs!
Come on!

1570
01:43:34,530 --> 01:43:38,613
Hey, you think you can handle
my political power?

1571
01:43:38,697 --> 01:43:39,363
Power, huh?

1572
01:43:39,822 --> 01:43:41,280
Is it around 1000 watts?

1573
01:43:41,863 --> 01:43:45,822
This political power isn't some degree
hat will last with you forever.

1574
01:43:46,572 --> 01:43:49,738
Power keeps shifting hands every
election season, you bastard!

1575
01:43:50,197 --> 01:43:50,738
Come on!

1576
01:43:50,822 --> 01:43:51,822
Hey...

1577
01:43:52,363 --> 01:43:53,530
Do you have a warrant?

1578
01:43:54,738 --> 01:43:55,780
I don't need one.

1579
01:43:55,863 --> 01:43:57,280
Did you file an FIR?

1580
01:43:57,697 --> 01:43:58,530
Yes.

1581
01:43:59,072 --> 01:44:00,238
What's the proof?

1582
01:44:00,863 --> 01:44:02,322
Who filed the complaint?

1583
01:44:02,572 --> 01:44:03,447
Look over there.

1584
01:44:05,447 --> 01:44:06,322
Oh.

1585
01:44:06,572 --> 01:44:08,488
You're still alive?

1586
01:44:09,197 --> 01:44:10,405
I won't spare you!

1587
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:15,572
I'll make sure you and
your little baby are dead.

1588
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:17,947
Say another word and I'll bury you
right here.

1589
01:44:17,988 --> 01:44:18,863
Come on!

1590
01:44:19,363 --> 01:44:21,905
Guys, take him to the station
and lock him up.

1591
01:44:22,072 --> 01:44:23,405
I'll take care of the rest.

1592
01:44:23,530 --> 01:44:24,655
- Okay, sir.
- Come with us, sir.

1593
01:44:34,488 --> 01:44:37,447
People who evade death need
to take a holy bath.

1594
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:41,238
Sprinkle the holy water on your head
and all your pain will go away.

1595
01:44:49,113 --> 01:44:50,155
Hey! No! No!

1596
01:44:56,947 --> 01:44:57,905
Sir...
- Sir...

1597
01:44:58,072 --> 01:44:59,572
You can't fold your hands
in front of us.

1598
01:44:59,738 --> 01:45:04,030
We consider you the God of our lives.

1599
01:45:05,197 --> 01:45:08,322
From today onwards, you're all like family.

1600
01:45:08,488 --> 01:45:12,613
Me and my daughter wouldn't have
been alive if it weren't for you.

1601
01:45:12,822 --> 01:45:15,238
Don't say that, sir. We come after you.

1602
01:45:15,572 --> 01:45:18,363
This is your land. Sir, this is my promise.

1603
01:45:19,030 --> 01:45:20,988
Your heir will be born on this land.

1604
01:45:21,238 --> 01:45:22,030
This is the truth.

1605
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:23,488
Be strong.

1606
01:45:25,197 --> 01:45:26,488
Why are you crying, dear?

1607
01:45:26,947 --> 01:45:28,988
Think of it as a nightmare and forget it.

1608
01:45:32,572 --> 01:45:33,738
Don't be sad, sir.

1609
01:45:34,238 --> 01:45:36,822
You're supposed to be our strength.

1610
01:45:37,988 --> 01:45:39,197
Sitaramayya...

1611
01:45:41,488 --> 01:45:43,613
My daughter became a widow right
in front of my eyes.

1612
01:45:45,613 --> 01:45:48,988
I didn't even get a chance to mourn.

1613
01:46:03,155 --> 01:46:05,197
Dharma, let him cry.

1614
01:46:05,488 --> 01:46:07,905
Atleast the burden is relieved.

1615
01:46:11,655 --> 01:46:12,697
- Lakshman...
- Sir...

1616
01:46:12,822 --> 01:46:14,947
Sir might have lived in a 5-acre home.

1617
01:46:15,113 --> 01:46:17,697
But now... These 5000 acres
will be his home. - Sir.

1618
01:46:17,863 --> 01:46:19,655
Gouri, prep the house. Go.
- Okay, sir.

1619
01:46:20,405 --> 01:46:21,280
Please come, sir.

1620
01:46:25,613 --> 01:46:27,280
Who the hell is calling me?

1621
01:46:30,072 --> 01:46:31,363
Hey, Dharma!

1622
01:46:32,113 --> 01:46:37,280
Wondering what I'm doing outside the jail?

1623
01:46:39,697 --> 01:46:42,197
I'm in my house, you fool!

1624
01:46:43,863 --> 01:46:46,072
Way before I set foot into your station...

1625
01:46:46,197 --> 01:46:48,988
Your higher officials arranged a bail for me.

1626
01:46:49,113 --> 01:46:51,488
Only God is my higher official.

1627
01:46:51,655 --> 01:46:53,697
I'm never going to spare you.

1628
01:46:53,822 --> 01:46:56,488
I won't spare you either.

1629
01:46:56,613 --> 01:47:00,905
- What the hell are you going to do?
- First I'll get you fired from the job.

1630
01:47:00,988 --> 01:47:02,530
That's very dangerous for you.

1631
01:47:02,655 --> 01:47:06,613
I'm like a lion in a cage
when I'm in my uniform.

1632
01:47:07,197 --> 01:47:10,572
Once I take it off,
I'm like a roaring lion. Unstoppable!

1633
01:47:10,905 --> 01:47:11,905
It's hunting time!

1634
01:47:11,947 --> 01:47:13,155
Hey!

1635
01:47:13,405 --> 01:47:15,947
I'll kill you in your cage itself.

1636
01:47:16,072 --> 01:47:17,447
Not just you...

1637
01:47:17,738 --> 01:47:21,447
I'll kill my brother, niece and
everyone else involved.

1638
01:47:21,530 --> 01:47:24,863
Want to see how big my cage is?
Or how many people are guarding it?

1639
01:47:25,405 --> 01:47:26,405
Hey!!!

1640
01:47:36,947 --> 01:47:39,072
Have one morsel.

1641
01:47:39,155 --> 01:47:41,197
- At least have some juice.
- No.

1642
01:47:41,697 --> 01:47:42,572
I'm not hungry.

1643
01:47:42,697 --> 01:47:44,530
- But you have to...
- Give her some space!

1644
01:47:44,738 --> 01:47:46,613
- Hey, get her a cable connection.
- Okay, ma'am.

1645
01:47:46,655 --> 01:47:47,822
Your mom's calling. Go.

1646
01:47:48,113 --> 01:47:49,322
Both of you go!

1647
01:47:49,405 --> 01:47:50,447
Yeah, sure.

1648
01:47:52,488 --> 01:47:54,780
Don't just sit idol.

1649
01:47:54,947 --> 01:47:57,155
He'll get you a cable connection.
Watch TV for some time.

1650
01:48:17,530 --> 01:48:18,363
Sandhya!

1651
01:48:19,030 --> 01:48:19,863
Sandhya!

1652
01:48:20,113 --> 01:48:20,947
Sandhya!

1653
01:48:22,947 --> 01:48:23,863
Where's Sandhya?

1654
01:48:27,572 --> 01:48:28,655
Is she alone?

1655
01:48:28,905 --> 01:48:29,530
Hmm.

1656
01:48:29,780 --> 01:48:31,405
Sandhya...

1657
01:48:32,405 --> 01:48:33,738
Sandhya...

1658
01:48:45,238 --> 01:48:47,030
Is this what you were looking for?

1659
01:48:47,822 --> 01:48:49,238
Come on. Answer me!

1660
01:48:49,447 --> 01:48:50,155
Sir...

1661
01:48:53,780 --> 01:48:55,780
Hey, you were looking for this knife, right?

1662
01:48:56,155 --> 01:48:57,363
You rascal!

1663
01:49:01,155 --> 01:49:03,322
Step out! You can't escape.

1664
01:49:04,572 --> 01:49:07,738
No one can enter our village
without our notice.

1665
01:49:07,822 --> 01:49:10,863
This is not a city that your actions
go unnoticed.

1666
01:49:11,030 --> 01:49:14,572
Here... He's our village's permanent
cable operator.

1667
01:49:14,905 --> 01:49:16,947
I realized it when he came in a new costume.

1668
01:49:17,155 --> 01:49:18,655
Sir! Sir! Sir!

1669
01:49:18,738 --> 01:49:20,072
Please forgive me.

1670
01:49:20,155 --> 01:49:22,655
Bhavaninath Thakur sent me
to kill your daughter.

1671
01:49:22,738 --> 01:49:24,197
It was a mistake. Please forgive me.

1672
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:26,363
We know everything.

1673
01:49:26,613 --> 01:49:27,988
Guys, leave him.

1674
01:49:28,322 --> 01:49:29,947
Thanks, sir. Thanks a lot.

1675
01:49:30,155 --> 01:49:33,405
I meant leave you at the police station.

1676
01:49:33,488 --> 01:49:35,447
Sir, please don't do that.
They'll hang me.

1677
01:49:35,613 --> 01:49:37,322
Take him!

1678
01:49:37,488 --> 01:49:39,947
Please sir...
Don't send me back...

1679
01:49:42,238 --> 01:49:43,947
Sir, this is your village.

1680
01:49:44,030 --> 01:49:45,155
We are all your family.

1681
01:49:45,238 --> 01:49:47,155
You're safe as long as you're with us.

1682
01:49:48,780 --> 01:49:50,863
Ravi, go inside and setup
the cable connection.

1683
01:49:51,072 --> 01:49:53,155
- We want Amazon
- Netflix as well.

1684
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,405
We want to watch soap operas too.

1685
01:49:54,613 --> 01:49:56,113
- Pogo too.
- Gemini TV as well.

1686
01:49:56,363 --> 01:49:58,280
Sandhya...

1687
01:49:58,905 --> 01:50:00,947
Sandhya...

1688
01:50:01,405 --> 01:50:04,988
Why are you so quiet, Sandhya?

1689
01:50:06,822 --> 01:50:08,988
Oh, really? No, Sandhya.

1690
01:50:09,197 --> 01:50:10,280
Sandhya...

1691
01:50:12,030 --> 01:50:13,155
Sandhya...

1692
01:50:14,030 --> 01:50:17,280
Sandhya... Skies are mesmerized
looking at our pair.

1693
01:50:17,572 --> 01:50:19,988
That is why it's pouring showers.

1694
01:50:20,738 --> 01:50:22,238
"This rain is drenching me"

1695
01:50:22,238 --> 01:50:24,905
Sleeping? I'll teach you a lesson.

1696
01:50:25,113 --> 01:50:27,030
- Do you feel the same, Sandhya?
- Yeah, I do.

1697
01:50:27,155 --> 01:50:28,113
Yay!

1698
01:50:28,530 --> 01:50:30,530
Why are you tickling me, Sandhya?

1699
01:50:30,697 --> 01:50:32,738
Stop it, Sandhya.

1700
01:50:32,863 --> 01:50:34,322
- Darling
- Let's be together, Sandhya.

1701
01:50:34,530 --> 01:50:36,655
You're my sunshine.

1702
01:50:36,780 --> 01:50:37,988
Sandhya! Sandhya! Sandhya!

1703
01:50:38,113 --> 01:50:39,113
Oh no!

1704
01:50:39,238 --> 01:50:42,155
Thank god my wedding
with him is cancelled.

1705
01:50:46,806 --> 01:50:51,972
Priest! You kept everyone waiting
to play cards here, huh?

1706
01:50:52,222 --> 01:50:54,097
These aren't playing cards...
It's a horoscope.

1707
01:50:54,222 --> 01:50:56,139
- Whose horoscopes are they?
- Dharma's and Sandhya's.

1708
01:50:56,306 --> 01:50:58,097
It's not the horoscopes
that need to match.

1709
01:50:58,181 --> 01:50:59,556
- Then?
- Two hearts.

1710
01:50:59,722 --> 01:51:00,222
Oh.

1711
01:51:00,306 --> 01:51:02,181
Did you ask Sandhya what's in her heart?

1712
01:51:02,347 --> 01:51:03,722
I didn't ask her and she never told me.

1713
01:51:03,764 --> 01:51:05,014
Then why don't you ask her now?

1714
01:51:05,139 --> 01:51:07,139
Why should we ask her?
She's still young to make decisions.

1715
01:51:07,306 --> 01:51:08,431
We will decide, being elders.

1716
01:51:08,472 --> 01:51:10,222
You can't make that decision for them.

1717
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:12,306
After all, they will have to live together.

1718
01:51:12,597 --> 01:51:14,056
All we can do is wish the best for them.

1719
01:51:14,556 --> 01:51:17,181
Sir, sometimes you are on point.

1720
01:51:17,306 --> 01:51:19,431
Do any one of you have caste feeling?

1721
01:51:19,597 --> 01:51:21,139
We all belong to the same family.

1722
01:51:21,306 --> 01:51:22,264
Farmers family.

1723
01:51:22,431 --> 01:51:24,222
People of all castes are living here together.

1724
01:51:24,347 --> 01:51:27,597
In that case, call Sandhya
and ask her opinion.

1725
01:51:27,722 --> 01:51:29,389
Sir! A small correction.

1726
01:51:29,514 --> 01:51:30,972
You're always on point.

1727
01:51:31,097 --> 01:51:32,722
Sisters, what are you looking at?

1728
01:51:32,806 --> 01:51:34,264
Go get Sandhya. Go!

1729
01:51:38,139 --> 01:51:39,764
What is she going to say now?

1730
01:51:41,889 --> 01:51:42,806
Oh god!

1731
01:51:42,931 --> 01:51:44,222
Sister-in-law, what's wrong?

1732
01:51:44,306 --> 01:51:45,347
Nothing.

1733
01:51:48,931 --> 01:51:50,264
Tell us, sweetheart. Tell us.

1734
01:51:50,389 --> 01:51:51,639
Don't force her, man.

1735
01:51:51,681 --> 01:51:52,847
I'm not trying to force her.

1736
01:51:52,972 --> 01:51:55,347
Just tell us who is in your heart, dear.

1737
01:52:00,847 --> 01:52:01,931
That's the priest.

1738
01:52:03,264 --> 01:52:04,139
Our sir.

1739
01:52:07,431 --> 01:52:08,556
What?

1740
01:52:08,847 --> 01:52:10,347
Why isn't anyone angry?

1741
01:52:10,556 --> 01:52:15,014
We would've been, if you had pointed
at a loser like him.

1742
01:52:15,681 --> 01:52:18,139
But you pointed at the right man.
Why would we be angry?

1743
01:52:18,306 --> 01:52:20,056
We were teasing you!

1744
01:52:20,972 --> 01:52:23,097
You did the same thing with us.

1745
01:52:27,139 --> 01:52:29,222
All of you kept this a secret, huh?

1746
01:52:31,097 --> 01:52:32,264
Go away, joker face!

1747
01:52:32,347 --> 01:52:34,472
Oh my god! I'm hurt.

1748
01:52:35,056 --> 01:52:37,181
[PLAYING OLD SAD SONG]

1749
01:52:41,722 --> 01:52:43,639
We're celebrating an auspicious occasion.

1750
01:52:43,681 --> 01:52:45,097
Why are you ruining it with your song?

1751
01:52:46,097 --> 01:52:48,514
Only a sad song will suit my life now.

1752
01:52:48,764 --> 01:52:50,806
It's not romantic like theirs.

1753
01:53:01,306 --> 01:53:05,597
"Let's have some fun today"

1754
01:53:06,556 --> 01:53:10,847
"Let's find the right time to swing away"

1755
01:53:22,639 --> 01:53:27,056
"Let's have some fun today"

1756
01:53:27,889 --> 01:53:32,514
"Let's find the right time to swing away"

1757
01:53:33,514 --> 01:53:36,139
"I finally found a beautiful treasure"

1758
01:53:36,264 --> 01:53:38,681
"Show how much you love me"

1759
01:53:38,764 --> 01:53:43,181
"I'm coming to you like an angry lion"

1760
01:53:44,097 --> 01:53:46,681
"Let's have some fun today"

1761
01:53:46,806 --> 01:53:49,389
"I can keep it going all night"

1762
01:53:49,514 --> 01:53:53,639
"Let me have a taste of your sweet youth"

1763
01:53:54,472 --> 01:53:57,181
"I can hear an alarm going off in my heart"

1764
01:53:57,306 --> 01:54:01,639
"Let's have some fun today"

1765
01:54:02,597 --> 01:54:07,056
"Let's find the right time to swing away"

1766
01:54:29,222 --> 01:54:32,389
"My lips are filled with nectar"

1767
01:54:32,931 --> 01:54:35,389
"They can get you high"

1768
01:54:35,597 --> 01:54:39,181
"Shall I wrap around you like
a wave of grace?"

1769
01:54:39,931 --> 01:54:43,181
"You keep provokiing me, girl"

1770
01:54:43,556 --> 01:54:46,056
"You don't need my permission"

1771
01:54:46,181 --> 01:54:49,722
"Pounce on to me,
Let our bodies battle it out"

1772
01:54:49,889 --> 01:54:54,972
"A prison of jasmines welcomes us"

1773
01:54:55,097 --> 01:55:00,639
"The dawn reminds us to cherish this night"

1774
01:55:01,264 --> 01:55:05,472
"Let's stop talking to get down to business"

1775
01:55:06,181 --> 01:55:09,139
"No one could leave me
desperate like you did"

1776
01:55:09,306 --> 01:55:13,806
"Let's have some fun today"

1777
01:55:14,514 --> 01:55:19,472
"Let's find the right time to swing away"

1778
01:55:41,347 --> 01:55:44,472
"As your glances poke me"

1779
01:55:44,722 --> 01:55:47,264
"I set your drapes right"

1780
01:55:47,597 --> 01:55:51,097
"I start blushing as my naughty
thoughts take over"

1781
01:55:51,972 --> 01:55:55,347
"As I snap my fingers on your cheek"

1782
01:55:55,514 --> 01:55:58,056
"And fondle that curvy waist of yours"

1783
01:55:58,181 --> 01:56:01,722
"I can feel the warmth of being
in your arms"

1784
01:56:01,889 --> 01:56:05,181
"Shall I cloak you like the Manali winters?"

1785
01:56:05,347 --> 01:56:07,014
"Shall I steal your senses?"

1786
01:56:07,139 --> 01:56:12,472
"Let my youth embrace your beauty"

1787
01:56:13,264 --> 01:56:17,097
"I'm always waiting for you, my love"

1788
01:56:18,472 --> 01:56:21,181
"It's time to churn love in
the ocean of romance"

1789
01:56:21,389 --> 01:56:25,764
"Let's have some fun today"

1790
01:56:26,597 --> 01:56:31,222
"Let's find the right time to swing away"

1791
01:56:32,181 --> 01:56:34,681
"I finally found a beautiful treasure"

1792
01:56:34,889 --> 01:56:37,347
"Show how much you love me"

1793
01:56:37,472 --> 01:56:41,722
"I'm coming to you like an angry lion"

1794
01:56:42,889 --> 01:56:45,431
"Let's have some fun today"

1795
01:56:45,639 --> 01:56:47,972
"I can keep it going all night"

1796
01:56:48,264 --> 01:56:52,264
"Let me have a taste of your sweet youth"

1797
01:56:53,139 --> 01:56:55,681
"I can hear an alarm going off in my heart"

1798
01:57:03,847 --> 01:57:06,931
"I can hear an alarm going off in my heart"

1799
01:57:27,097 --> 01:57:27,972
Hey! It's Dharma's vehicle.

1800
01:57:28,056 --> 01:57:29,722
Information is correct. Let's go!

1801
01:57:33,431 --> 01:57:35,556
Hey! Where's the girl Dharma brought here
for a check up?

1802
01:57:36,431 --> 01:57:37,931
First floor, room no. 12.

1803
01:58:00,639 --> 01:58:03,097
Hey! Where's the girl that Dharma
brought here?

1804
01:58:03,222 --> 01:58:04,472
They left just now.

1805
01:58:06,806 --> 01:58:08,097
They're escaping through the fire exit.

1806
01:58:08,139 --> 01:58:09,972
Go this way....
You guys come with me.

1807
01:58:18,597 --> 01:58:19,931
Bro! They are running away.

1808
01:58:24,514 --> 01:58:25,347
Come on!

1809
01:58:28,889 --> 01:58:29,722
You need to leave now!

1810
01:58:29,806 --> 01:58:30,847
Why are you scared?

1811
01:58:30,972 --> 01:58:32,181
They can't chase us.

1812
01:58:32,222 --> 01:58:33,722
His men are chasing us.

1813
01:58:33,806 --> 01:58:35,514
Get out of here as quickly as possible.
- Trust me.

1814
01:58:35,847 --> 01:58:36,806
They can't come after us.

1815
01:58:36,889 --> 01:58:38,181
Hey! Drive!

1816
01:58:39,056 --> 01:58:41,597
- What happened?
- Vehicle isn't moving, bro.

1817
01:58:43,889 --> 01:58:45,306
Hey! Get me down.

1818
01:58:45,556 --> 01:58:48,472
Listen to me and get me down.

1819
01:58:49,097 --> 01:58:50,139
I'll kill you!

1820
01:58:50,764 --> 01:58:52,139
Hey! Get me down!

1821
01:58:52,222 --> 01:58:53,806
- Bhavaninath Thakur!
- Down! Down!

1822
01:58:54,056 --> 01:58:55,847
- Bhavaninath Thakur!
- Down! Down!

1823
01:58:56,056 --> 01:58:58,139
- Bhavaninath Thakur!
- Down! Down!

1824
01:59:01,514 --> 01:59:04,389
Hey, the farmers who turned against me...

1825
01:59:04,556 --> 01:59:07,097
Can never live in peace.

1826
01:59:16,014 --> 01:59:18,472
Hey! Who is it?
There's a black out.

1827
01:59:18,556 --> 01:59:20,306
Go to the electricity office and find out
what happened.

1828
01:59:20,431 --> 01:59:22,347
We made the call...

1829
01:59:22,472 --> 01:59:24,097
They said power won't be back
until a few hours. - Why is that?

1830
01:59:24,347 --> 01:59:25,639
Orders from higher authorities.

1831
01:59:25,722 --> 01:59:27,306
You should've asked them loudly.

1832
01:59:27,514 --> 01:59:29,347
I did exactly the same and they hung up.

1833
01:59:30,056 --> 01:59:32,806
I know who is behind this. Forget it.

1834
01:59:33,014 --> 01:59:34,847
Everyone look up.

1835
01:59:40,972 --> 01:59:42,972
This is the true, permanent light.

1836
01:59:43,056 --> 01:59:45,014
Can anyone dare to stop this light?

1837
01:59:45,222 --> 01:59:46,264
No way!

1838
01:59:46,389 --> 01:59:47,806
We'll manage outdoors.

1839
01:59:48,056 --> 01:59:51,181
What about inside the houses?
- We've got lanterns.

1840
01:59:51,431 --> 01:59:52,722
Long lasting!

1841
01:59:53,181 --> 01:59:55,222
My son taught me this word in English.

1842
01:59:55,306 --> 01:59:56,597
You're super, auntie.

1843
01:59:58,597 --> 01:59:59,556
Hey! Hey!

1844
01:59:59,597 --> 02:00:00,681
It's a six!

1845
02:00:00,806 --> 02:00:02,389
You crook!

1846
02:00:02,639 --> 02:00:04,181
Stop it! Stop it!
- Mom, mom!

1847
02:00:04,264 --> 02:00:05,139
What's wrong?

1848
02:00:05,306 --> 02:00:10,139
It's his sister's wedding and
he didn't buy me a piece of cloth.

1849
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:12,639
- Why didn't buy her clothes?
- I tried...

1850
02:00:12,847 --> 02:00:15,306
But the local bus didn't stop
in our village.

1851
02:00:15,556 --> 02:00:16,972
And the bus which stopped
never moved.

1852
02:00:17,056 --> 02:00:18,347
So there was no transport.

1853
02:00:18,431 --> 02:00:19,556
What about your jeep?

1854
02:00:19,597 --> 02:00:23,264
My boss took it to another village
for investigation.

1855
02:00:23,347 --> 02:00:25,056
- You could walk...
- I could.

1856
02:00:25,264 --> 02:00:27,347
I walked to the store.

1857
02:00:27,472 --> 02:00:28,472
My leg slipped.

1858
02:00:28,556 --> 02:00:31,639
As soon as I turned right, I saw my shop.

1859
02:00:31,806 --> 02:00:33,472
So I had a few pegs.

1860
02:00:34,181 --> 02:00:35,889
Your shop? What the hell!

1861
02:00:36,097 --> 02:00:37,722
I know this must be hard for you.

1862
02:00:38,597 --> 02:00:40,056
Not at all, sir.

1863
02:00:40,181 --> 02:00:43,972
We might have lost all our harvest.
Farmers might have been killed brutally.

1864
02:00:44,139 --> 02:00:46,556
But our loyalty to you will remain the same.

1865
02:00:46,764 --> 02:00:48,014
It's okay if the buses aren't running.

1866
02:00:48,139 --> 02:00:49,222
Let's go by bullock carts.

1867
02:00:53,097 --> 02:00:54,431
Dharma might not be with them.

1868
02:00:54,556 --> 02:00:56,306
But the villagers are his strongest support.

1869
02:00:56,472 --> 02:00:58,264
So, just follow my orders.

1870
02:00:59,014 --> 02:01:01,264
For the development of Jhansi district...

1871
02:01:01,472 --> 02:01:04,139
The 500 farmer families that have been
summoned from Andhra...

1872
02:01:04,389 --> 02:01:07,847
Have been granted 5000 acres of land
on lease by the UP Government.

1873
02:01:08,222 --> 02:01:12,681
As there was no good produce like
the Government anticipated...

1874
02:01:12,931 --> 02:01:15,306
As they couldn't pay back
the taxes in time...

1875
02:01:15,514 --> 02:01:17,222
According to the Survey of India Act...

1876
02:01:17,389 --> 02:01:24,514
Government has annulled the 5000 acres
of land the GO issued in 1987.

1877
02:01:25,139 --> 02:01:26,889
- What's going on?
- This is so unfair.

1878
02:01:27,681 --> 02:01:29,514
This is unfair.

1879
02:01:30,722 --> 02:01:33,597
No one has the right to annul
the order after 30 years.

1880
02:01:34,014 --> 02:01:35,722
I passed that order and I know very well.

1881
02:01:35,847 --> 02:01:36,931
It hasn't been 30 years, sir.

1882
02:01:37,139 --> 02:01:38,681
Only 29.

1883
02:01:38,806 --> 02:01:42,139
Sir, we've been here for 30 years
and 4 months.

1884
02:01:42,306 --> 02:01:43,139
Might be...

1885
02:01:43,222 --> 02:01:45,639
But the time period started the day
you paid your first tax.

1886
02:01:45,806 --> 02:01:48,597
Collector, may I know who passed this order?

1887
02:01:48,764 --> 02:01:51,889
Revenue Minister's orders, once the bill
has been passed in the Assembly.

1888
02:01:52,597 --> 02:01:53,306
Please come.

1889
02:01:54,014 --> 02:01:56,889
Mr. Sitaramayya...
We lived a decent life for 30 years.

1890
02:01:57,056 --> 02:01:58,389
Do we have to start begging now?

1891
02:01:59,264 --> 02:02:04,139
I promised to give the land as dowry
for my daughter's wedding.

1892
02:02:04,431 --> 02:02:07,139
Wedding will be cancelled
if I can't keep that promise.

1893
02:02:07,847 --> 02:02:09,889
Sir, it's the place our kids grew up in.

1894
02:02:10,139 --> 02:02:12,014
But we have no place of our own now.

1895
02:02:12,181 --> 02:02:13,722
How do you expect us to make a living?

1896
02:02:13,931 --> 02:02:15,556
Tell us, sir. Tell us.

1897
02:02:15,681 --> 02:02:17,306
We didn't mind the power cut.

1898
02:02:17,931 --> 02:02:20,264
We didn't mind the lack of transport either.

1899
02:02:20,472 --> 02:02:22,139
Because we considered this land our home.

1900
02:02:22,472 --> 02:02:26,097
But they took away the roof
above our heads.

1901
02:02:31,306 --> 02:02:34,097
Sir, I can't allow anyone inside
without the owner's permission.

1902
02:02:34,222 --> 02:02:35,222
Who's the owner, huh?

1903
02:02:35,431 --> 02:02:36,597
Racism?

1904
02:02:36,764 --> 02:02:38,264
It might be news for the Press.

1905
02:02:38,306 --> 02:02:39,972
But I don't give a damn about it.

1906
02:02:40,181 --> 02:02:45,181
I'll chase those slum dogs
out of the State for going against me.

1907
02:02:46,556 --> 02:02:47,431
Go in, sir.

1908
02:02:48,181 --> 02:02:51,222
Why did you give 3 months grace period
for those Telugu farmers?

1909
02:02:53,514 --> 02:02:54,889
I'll talk to you later.

1910
02:02:56,722 --> 02:02:58,347
Welcome, brother...

1911
02:02:58,639 --> 02:02:59,931
What brings you here so early?

1912
02:03:00,181 --> 02:03:03,056
You're acting like a crazy caste-maniac!
Why are you harassing the farmers?

1913
02:03:03,347 --> 02:03:05,847
Find another groom in our Thakur family.
I'll get her married to him.

1914
02:03:05,931 --> 02:03:07,056
Are you happy with that?

1915
02:03:09,181 --> 02:03:11,181
Being a politician for so long,

1916
02:03:11,681 --> 02:03:13,722
how could you not understand this?

1917
02:03:16,181 --> 02:03:19,639
The reason I became violent at the party
was for cashing in votes.

1918
02:03:19,847 --> 02:03:22,472
Do you even realize how many votes
our caste makes up to?

1919
02:03:22,722 --> 02:03:27,431
I finished my campaign for
the next elections in a single day.

1920
02:03:27,597 --> 02:03:29,639
Then why are you still trying
to kill my daughter?

1921
02:03:29,931 --> 02:03:33,306
Father put all the assets in your name,
without trusting me.

1922
02:03:34,014 --> 02:03:37,389
All the wealth goes to your daughter
and her child after you.

1923
02:03:38,222 --> 02:03:41,181
Our assets are worth millions.

1924
02:03:41,347 --> 02:03:45,389
Alright. I'll transfer all of it
in your name. Okay?

1925
02:03:49,431 --> 02:03:51,722
Okay. But your daughter must sign too.

1926
02:03:51,847 --> 02:03:53,389
I'll tell her to sign it.

1927
02:03:53,556 --> 02:03:57,514
But... Will you cancel the G.O then?

1928
02:04:00,931 --> 02:04:02,431
That's not possible.

1929
02:04:03,056 --> 02:04:04,889
I want them out of here.

1930
02:04:05,514 --> 02:04:07,514
It's not some ordinary land.

1931
02:04:08,139 --> 02:04:11,639
City is developed all the way
to those lands.

1932
02:04:12,347 --> 02:04:15,514
That barren land was worth 50 lakhs
when you gave it to them.

1933
02:04:16,222 --> 02:04:21,347
Now price is 5000 times more...
25,000 crores.

1934
02:04:22,264 --> 02:04:27,097
Using my influence in the government,
I will sell those lands to an industry.

1935
02:04:27,931 --> 02:04:29,764
I already took the advance.

1936
02:04:30,681 --> 02:04:32,389
In simple words,

1937
02:04:32,639 --> 02:04:36,681
I resorted to the emotion of caste,
religion and language just for votes.

1938
02:04:37,431 --> 02:04:41,139
I'm all about the money, power and fame.

1939
02:04:41,722 --> 02:04:46,306
If you want to live in India,
live like the Ambanis and Adanis.

1940
02:04:46,806 --> 02:04:50,097
I want my kids to rule in the coming times.

1941
02:04:50,389 --> 02:04:51,847
What if you died right now?

1942
02:04:52,764 --> 02:04:53,472
Brother!

1943
02:04:57,181 --> 02:04:58,222
No!

1944
02:05:11,639 --> 02:05:14,181
Damn! I shouldn't have done that.

1945
02:05:14,847 --> 02:05:16,722
He was going to write all the assets
in my name.

1946
02:05:16,889 --> 02:05:19,097
Brother, please don't die.

1947
02:05:19,306 --> 02:05:21,514
Brother... I need you for something.

1948
02:05:21,597 --> 02:05:22,972
Get up, brother...

1949
02:05:23,139 --> 02:05:24,306
Please don't die!

1950
02:05:26,972 --> 02:05:29,139
Bhavaninath Thakur is being so atrocious, sir.

1951
02:05:29,722 --> 02:05:32,806
He executed this in the time
I was out of town.

1952
02:05:33,889 --> 02:05:36,931
Aren't we supposed to be loyal to the man
who was gracious to give us the lands?

1953
02:05:37,222 --> 02:05:38,764
We've been living here
since 2 generations.

1954
02:05:38,889 --> 02:05:39,806
Here you go, bro.

1955
02:05:40,472 --> 02:05:43,389
Tax receipts we've been paying
to the Government since the last 30 years.

1956
02:05:43,514 --> 02:05:45,972
Take a look...
Get stay order for the cancelled G.O.

1957
02:05:46,181 --> 02:05:47,764
- File a case.
- Okay, sir.

1958
02:05:47,889 --> 02:05:49,264
All the farmers will sign.

1959
02:05:50,264 --> 02:05:54,431
We can't lose these lands and live
like slaves on the Telugu land.

1960
02:05:56,972 --> 02:05:58,972
It's time they change treating
Telugu people as inferior to them.

1961
02:05:59,306 --> 02:06:01,556
If all the Telugu farmers protest...

1962
02:06:01,764 --> 02:06:03,139
The whole world will be surprised.

1963
02:06:03,347 --> 02:06:05,306
We're ready to die...

1964
02:06:05,389 --> 02:06:10,264
But we'll never leave the side
of Virendranath Thakur's family.

1965
02:06:10,972 --> 02:06:12,306
There's nobody at Thakur's place.

1966
02:06:12,431 --> 02:06:13,472
But I found this letter.

1967
02:06:15,347 --> 02:06:17,847
Dharma, you've done a lot for us.

1968
02:06:17,972 --> 02:06:20,139
This world will prosper only when
the lives of farmers will.

1969
02:06:20,264 --> 02:06:23,056
We will forever be grateful for your help.

1970
02:06:23,389 --> 02:06:25,806
Forgive us for leaving without notice.

1971
02:06:37,264 --> 02:06:38,097
What is it, dad?

1972
02:06:38,597 --> 02:06:41,472
Did you seek blessings from the temple?

1973
02:06:41,722 --> 02:06:42,514
Hmmm.

1974
02:06:42,681 --> 02:06:44,806
The train to Delhi will leave
in another 15 minutes.

1975
02:06:44,931 --> 02:06:45,931
Come fast, dad.

1976
02:06:48,181 --> 02:06:50,222
Dad, Dharma is calling...

1977
02:06:50,556 --> 02:06:51,597
Come fast.

1978
02:06:51,722 --> 02:06:52,889
I'm waiting.

1979
02:06:53,722 --> 02:06:56,806
Hey! She's in the Delhi train.

1980
02:06:57,139 --> 02:07:02,347
Ask Bikshu Patel to take our men
with him and kill her.

1981
02:07:02,597 --> 02:07:05,514
Search all the places railway stations,
bus stand and airport.

1982
02:07:06,347 --> 02:07:07,972
Take me to the police station.
- Okay, sir..

1983
02:07:09,931 --> 02:07:11,014
Hello, Control Room...

1984
02:07:11,764 --> 02:07:15,806
Cut my brother's left thumb
and preserve it.

1985
02:07:16,139 --> 02:07:17,972
It will be useful in the future.

1986
02:07:18,056 --> 02:07:18,889
Hey!

1987
02:07:20,056 --> 02:07:23,847
Crush his body in our paper mill machine.

1988
02:07:34,181 --> 02:07:35,181
Sorry, brother.

1989
02:07:37,222 --> 02:07:39,139
Why didn't you both answer my calls?

1990
02:07:39,306 --> 02:07:40,931
They are doing it on purpose, sir.

1991
02:07:42,347 --> 02:07:43,556
Search!

1992
02:07:44,847 --> 02:07:46,722
Go that way.
We can't miss them.

1993
02:07:48,264 --> 02:07:50,139
Don't leave any compartment unsearched.

1994
02:07:50,222 --> 02:07:51,722
Search every compartment.

1995
02:07:58,097 --> 02:07:59,597
Why is dad cutting my call?

1996
02:08:07,806 --> 02:08:08,681
Did you find her?

1997
02:08:08,764 --> 02:08:09,722
No, brother.

1998
02:08:09,847 --> 02:08:12,389
Go search all the compartments again.

1999
02:08:12,639 --> 02:08:14,389
What are you still looking at? Go!

2000
02:08:21,639 --> 02:08:22,306
Hello.

2001
02:08:29,764 --> 02:08:30,389
Hello...

2002
02:08:30,472 --> 02:08:31,972
Are you at the railway station?

2003
02:08:32,097 --> 02:08:34,306
Yes, brother... I'm in the train to Delhi.

2004
02:08:34,847 --> 02:08:36,222
I'm really scared.

2005
02:08:37,597 --> 02:08:38,764
Don't be scared...

2006
02:08:39,764 --> 02:08:40,847
Do as I tell you.

2007
02:08:50,389 --> 02:08:51,014
How are you doing?

2008
02:08:51,056 --> 02:08:53,139
We searched the Delhi train.

2009
02:08:53,431 --> 02:08:55,097
- We didn't find her.
- Fools!

2010
02:08:55,431 --> 02:08:58,347
Search all the other trains then.

2011
02:08:58,847 --> 02:09:00,722
Kill her as soon as you find her.

2012
02:09:00,889 --> 02:09:02,306
- Okay, brother.
- Alright then. I'll leave.

2013
02:09:02,389 --> 02:09:04,431
We'll search all the other trains.
We won't let her go.

2014
02:09:43,681 --> 02:09:45,472
Guys! She's in the train to Andhra.

2015
02:09:46,347 --> 02:09:47,347
Catch her!

2016
02:09:52,014 --> 02:09:52,764
Sit down!

2017
02:09:54,764 --> 02:09:55,597
What's wrong, dear?

2018
02:09:55,889 --> 02:09:57,181
You don't trust me?

2019
02:09:57,389 --> 02:09:58,972
Did you think I couldn't save you?

2020
02:09:59,139 --> 02:10:00,306
No, brother.
Dad said...

2021
02:10:00,431 --> 02:10:02,097
Where's your father?

2022
02:10:02,181 --> 02:10:03,931
Dad is on a important...
- Hello

2023
02:10:04,306 --> 02:10:04,931
Mr. Reddy...

2024
02:10:05,139 --> 02:10:07,472
Did she take the direct flight to Andhra?

2025
02:10:07,722 --> 02:10:09,597
She will get down at the next station.
Go get her.

2026
02:10:10,014 --> 02:10:12,097
She can't escape.
Okay, brother.

2027
02:10:12,264 --> 02:10:14,056
Dharma will find her somehow.

2028
02:10:14,264 --> 02:10:15,597
He's really smart.

2029
02:10:15,764 --> 02:10:17,847
Put your intelligence to use and kill him.

2030
02:10:19,806 --> 02:10:20,264
Start the vehicles!

2031
02:10:25,753 --> 02:10:26,794
Thank you.

2032
02:10:27,378 --> 02:10:28,086
Look, dear.

2033
02:10:28,169 --> 02:10:31,044
No one can harm us once
this train reaches Andhra border.

2034
02:10:31,419 --> 02:10:33,128
Why are you crying, dear? Hmm?

2035
02:10:33,419 --> 02:10:36,044
I'm also coming to the Andhra border
with you.

2036
02:10:36,253 --> 02:10:37,669
I miss father.

2037
02:10:37,794 --> 02:10:40,003
Your father is always by our side.

2038
02:10:40,211 --> 02:10:42,253
I already asked the cops to track him down.

2039
02:10:43,902 --> 02:10:45,027
You don't worry about it.

2040
02:10:45,580 --> 02:10:47,107
- Daughter! Daughter!
- Mother!

2041
02:10:47,253 --> 02:10:48,351
- Oh no!
- Careful.

2042
02:10:55,371 --> 02:10:56,235
Brother!

2043
02:11:04,886 --> 02:11:05,873
Come dear.

2044
02:11:53,919 --> 02:11:54,711
Brother!

2045
02:12:09,917 --> 02:12:11,625
Stay here... I'll be back in 2 minutes.

2046
02:12:27,503 --> 02:12:33,169
Guys! Kill them both and parcel
their bodies to Andhra in the same train.

2047
02:12:33,312 --> 02:12:35,729
You can't just parcel me...
I'm like a wounded lion.

2048
02:12:36,253 --> 02:12:37,836
I'm not dying anytime soon.

2049
02:12:38,294 --> 02:12:40,294
I'll hunt you down and kill you.

2050
02:12:40,669 --> 02:12:42,086
Come on!

2051
02:12:42,169 --> 02:12:43,253
Kill him, guys!

2052
02:13:24,669 --> 02:13:28,253
Climb on top of the train,
go and kill her.

2053
02:14:06,086 --> 02:14:07,503
Brother, I'll call an ambulance.

2054
02:14:07,794 --> 02:14:09,753
We'll get down at the next station
and rush to the hospital.

2055
02:14:09,961 --> 02:14:10,961
I'll be fine.

2056
02:14:11,403 --> 02:14:13,174
I'll go to the hospital only after
dropping you to the Andhra border.

2057
02:14:13,294 --> 02:14:15,669
How could you still be thinking
in my best interest?

2058
02:14:36,086 --> 02:14:37,086
Brother!

2059
02:14:43,424 --> 02:14:46,215
Like you said, he's the God
that saved your lives.

2060
02:14:48,544 --> 02:14:49,878
They killed him brutally.

2061
02:14:51,086 --> 02:14:52,419
Dharma isn't dead.

2062
02:14:55,004 --> 02:14:56,171
You are Dharma.

2063
02:14:59,961 --> 02:15:02,961
2 years ago, just like they described,

2064
02:15:03,503 --> 02:15:05,836
I saw you at the railway station
in a pool of blood.

2065
02:15:06,851 --> 02:15:07,915
Sorry, son.

2066
02:15:08,836 --> 02:15:10,461
It was very selfish.

2067
02:15:11,588 --> 02:15:13,087
I was in a pretty tough situation
back then.

2068
02:15:15,734 --> 02:15:16,579
Forgive me.

2069
02:15:16,694 --> 02:15:19,869
But I don't remember anything they said.

2070
02:15:20,276 --> 02:15:21,718
You don't remember anything?

2071
02:15:23,128 --> 02:15:24,355
Then come with me.

2072
02:15:29,918 --> 02:15:31,168
Dharma is going to have food.

2073
02:15:31,253 --> 02:15:33,003
I'm going with him... Aren't you coming?

2074
02:15:33,086 --> 02:15:34,419
I'm hungry!

2075
02:15:39,586 --> 02:15:41,753
Tell me if you remember at least now.

2076
02:15:49,629 --> 02:15:51,421
Is she Niranjana Prasad?

2077
02:15:53,679 --> 02:15:54,513
Yes.

2078
02:15:55,544 --> 02:15:56,669
Forgive me, brother.

2079
02:15:57,663 --> 02:15:58,695
Forgive me.

2080
02:15:59,641 --> 02:16:02,724
I only told them that you are dead.

2081
02:16:03,523 --> 02:16:04,728
Please forgive me.

2082
02:16:06,437 --> 02:16:07,571
Forgive me.

2083
02:16:10,052 --> 02:16:11,248
Give me a minute.

2084
02:16:23,872 --> 02:16:29,712
Bhavaninath Thakur had all the Telugu states
searched for me when I was pregnant.

2085
02:16:30,086 --> 02:16:37,169
Your dad said ‘My son promised
to keep you both safe.'

2086
02:16:37,586 --> 02:16:39,336
‘Let me keep that promise.'

2087
02:16:39,898 --> 02:16:43,398
He convinced me to stay
and treated me like a Princess.

2088
02:16:44,484 --> 02:16:46,068
Overcoming all the obstacles,

2089
02:16:46,253 --> 02:16:50,295
I gave birth to my son on this land
like you wished.

2090
02:16:51,177 --> 02:16:52,395

People usually create history after
they are born and raised.

2093

in it is still alive.

Brother, look over there.

How dare she hold her son in her arms
and come to this palace!

Their bodies should turn into pieces
Shoot them down immediately.

2107

Shoot!

2108
02:18:43,517 --> 02:18:48,568
Hey! Are you Dharma
or Arjun Prasad now?

Hey!

02:18:50,869 --> 02:18:53,327
I'm the Arjun Prasad that cussed you badly.

2111
02:18:53,565 --> 02:18:56,898
I'm also the Dharma that shoved
you into the police jeep.

2112
02:18:57,720 --> 02:18:58,595
Hey, police!

2113
02:18:58,753 --> 02:18:59,711
I'll tell him sir.

2114

Don't just stand there with the guns.

2115

Shoot everyone down!

2116
02:19:04,461 --> 02:19:05,878
It's the Minister's order.

2117
02:19:05,961 --> 02:19:08,003
Sir, you are no longer in power.

2118
02:19:08,169 --> 02:19:09,088
What?

2119
02:19:09,211 --> 02:19:10,095
Sir, phone call.

- Who is it?
- Bhavaninath Thakur.

You're a central minister...

2122

But I don't have power like you.

2123
02:19:19,961 --> 02:19:21,836
Tell me, Bhavani. What's going on?

2124
02:19:22,003 --> 02:19:23,878
So arrogant, huh?

2125
02:19:24,151 --> 02:19:26,651
I was told I'm no longer in power.

2126
02:19:26,961 --> 02:19:28,627
It's not just the Minister post.

2127

You're no longer a member of the party either.

- What?
- Hey!

Arjun Prasad was gracious enough to donate
2000 crores as party fund.

02:19:37,844 --> 02:19:39,343
Entirely legal money.

2131

So what?

2132
02:19:40,628 --> 02:19:42,961
He only asked for two things in return.

2133
02:19:43,378 --> 02:19:49,294
First, take away your Minister post
and suspend you as a party member.

2134
