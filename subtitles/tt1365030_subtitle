5
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,901
What is the problem?
What has happened?

6
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,362
She wants to go to Madras!

7
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,172
She does not know that
Madras been changed to Chennai.

8
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,436
She doesn't know whom
she has to meet there.

9
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,971
Why does she want to go
to India at this age?

10
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,982
Will you allow me
only if I know all this?

11
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,256
Why should I know about the place..

12
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,784
..where I lived once?

13
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:18,695
Why do you take the vehicle?

14
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,823
She takes my vehicle whenever
she come here from America. Go man

15
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,704
You take care of those who are
from America. She is from London.

16
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:32,641
London?

17
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,985
Go man!

18
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,086
She is calling you.

19
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,493
She looks like rat..
and she is a bandicoot!

20
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,692
Both make fun of me.

21
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,354
They don't know that we are
smart in earning money.

June 18, 1945 -Madharasapattinam

23
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,807
-India..
-Our land.

24
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,742
-Britishers..
-Get out.

25
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:23,481
-Britishers..
-Get out.

26
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,687
-India!
-Our land.

27
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:21,477
Go man.

28
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,272
Car is going!

29
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,548
You should have come with
your group.

30
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:08,845
Keep it inside.

31
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,076
-Sir! I have unloaded the luggage.
-Go.

32
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:15,645
Ladies and gentlemen, those
who came here on governor's invitation..

33
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:19,455
I invite you all on behalf of
the Governor's bungalow.

34
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:23,322
On this wonderful day..
in this Madras city..

35
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,602
..in our Madras city as the new..

36
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,742
Move man...

37
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,878
I'll hit you.

38
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:14,169
Do they need a large ground
to play goli (Marbles)?

39
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,646
It is not goli but golf.

40
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,711
-It means...?
-They will hit a goli with a stick.

41
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,197
-Parithi wins 1 anna bet.
-Ranga wins 1 anna.

42
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,274
-Parithi..!
-Ranga..!

43
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,952
Parithi wins 1 anna,
Kabir wins 1 anna.

44
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:13,962
1..2...3..

45
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,439
4...5..

46
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,567
Kabir gets defeated.

47
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,918
-Parithi wins 1 anna.
-I won't make the bet.

48
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:30,453
You come off man.

49
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,522
-Parithi wins 1 anna.
-Karna wins 1 anna.

50
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:45,331
-Parithi..
-Karna..

51
00:16:55,114 --> 00:17:00,279
1..2...3..4..5..

52
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,613
I will stab you.

53
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:18,300
-Parithi wins 1 anna...
-Ayyakannu wins 1 anna.

54
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:33,880
Sir, don't leave him.

55
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,127
Sir, don't leave him.

56
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:09,682
1..2...3..4..5..!

57
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,684
What? Are you giving up for me?

58
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:21,159
Rain is coming!

59
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,167
Brother, come.
It will rain.

60
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:45,990
Clouds! Oh, Clouds!

61
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:51,519
Don't rain now!

62
00:18:52,164 --> 00:19:01,004
At dusk
we will call you again!

63
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,471
Don't go away.

64
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:45,510
Oh! Clouds! Don't rain now.

65
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:50,519
At dusk
we will call you again!

66
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,317
Don't go away.

67
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:58,725
The Buckingham canal
is our temple..

68
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:02,331
We wash clothes
for our living!

69
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:07,335
Go man... go away man.

70
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:12,001
We will do our work before the sun set!

71
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:17,214
Oh! Clouds! Don't rain now.

72
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:22,550
At dusk
we will call you again!

73
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,212
Don't go away.

74
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:53,384
When the sun shines,
we will dye the clothes.

75
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:58,046
We will take off
if it rains.

76
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:06,190
Come.. Only 1. It is 6
Come.. only 1. 6 again

77
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:10,296
Come.. Only 1.
It is 3

78
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:16,134
Like the donkey carrying
a lot of clothes..

79
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:21,143
..we have enough burden in the life.

80
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:29,753
The life of launderer is similar to God.

81
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:34,022
We too carry your bundle of sins

82
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:39,427
Though we live with dirt
our minds are clean.

83
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:43,295
They are pure like the sky.

84
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:47,969
Go man... go away man.

85
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:50,639
We will do our work before the sun set!

86
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:54,678
Come man.

87
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:33,950
We have neither money
nor deceit in our minds.

88
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,881
We don't show off.

89
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,683
So there are no loss or anguish

90
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,022
Greetings sir!

91
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,284
Your shirt is stained.

92
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,555
Where are you from?

93
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:47,628
l give him a slap.

94
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:52,302
We have never gone to the school.

95
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,564
We learned by our experience.

96
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:56,766
Hence, we have no worries.

97
00:22:57,075 --> 00:23:01,569
-One cent is cent.
-One cent is cent.

98
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,773
2 cents are half quarter.

99
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,179
2 cents are half quarter.

100
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:10,778
3 cents are three fourth.

101
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:15,121
4 cents are quarter.

102
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,595
Where are you running?

103
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,932
-They are dropping bombs!
-Run!

104
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:29,735
-They are dropping bombs!
-Run!

105
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,359
They did not drop bombs.

106
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,292
All can come out.

107
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,887
They did not drop bombs.
All can come out.

108
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,027
We will come as bomb sometime.

109
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:03,571
We are not afraid of any hit by lurching.

110
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,068
Even if we bow down our heads..

111
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,372
..our prestige will not get lost.

112
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,309
We will live as the moist soil.

113
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:16,949
Go man...go away man.

114
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,783
We will do our work before the sun set!

115
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:28,663
Come man... come man.

116
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,204
Rain is coming!

117
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:21,980
Oh, Clouds! Let us drench in the rain.

118
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:30,150
At dusk,
we showed our joy to you.

119
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:41,732
-This area..
-Sir!

120
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:48,679
-What is it? -You have come
with the Britishers! What is the news?

121
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:51,281
What difference will it make?
Go away from here.

122
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,476
You have come to our place.
...and asking us to go out.

123
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,416
-Is it your place?
-Yes.

124
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,818
A golf course is been
proposed to come here.

125
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:01,950
Governor has agreed to it.
Try to vacate this place.

126
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:04,962
Sir! This place belongs to us.

127
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:13,032
God! I hope our place will be safe.

128
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,766
You know well that many
depend on this place.

129
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,637
Can all be little calm?

130
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:22,703
We wash the clothes of the
governor's community...

131
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:24,975
..as we live in the Buckingham canal side.
-Nothing will happen to our place.

132
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,641
-Why..?
-Mom said me!

133
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,446
We live here as a community.

134
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:34,389
We came to know that
our colony is going to be vacated.

135
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:39,259
If it happens so,
we will be homeless and..

136
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:42,595
..-we have to go to the road for a living.
-Sir..!

137
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,927
Do you want us to beg for a living?

138
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:48,005
We can't do any thing blindly.

139
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,336
We believe in the river for our survival.

140
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,075
Being the land where Nethaji has born
why do we have to be fearful?

141
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:56,002
He talks about a dead man.

142
00:26:57,248 --> 00:27:00,081
-Do you know that he is no more?
-Look!

143
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:03,279
We don't come for a fight
or rowdiness with you.

144
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,151
-Whom are you calling as rowdy?
-Are you calling us as rowdies?

145
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,365
-Stop it.
-Stop. He is talking big

146
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,094
We have to be patient as many
families depend on this profession.

147
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,430
We should handle this softly.

148
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,299
We are going to give application
to the governor.

149
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:22,896
If you want you can come,
or can sit idle.

150
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:54,668
Oh my god!

151
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:58,870
Mind your work!

152
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:04,475
54.. 55... 56..

153
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:12,482
57.. 58.. 59.. 60.

154
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,555
Run for your life.

155
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:05,864
-Tell me the name.
-Parithi.

156
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:08,129
He is the one you told.

157
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,002
But there is no one like him.

158
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:14,601
You are right.
This was taken 60 years ago.

159
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:18,142
Is there anyone
called Selvi, Parithi here?

160
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,815
Is there anyone
called Selvi, Parithi here?

161
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,015
I don't think there is.

162
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:27,752
We don't know.

163
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:34,889
Catch it!

164
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,899
Look! This is the washer man's colony.

165
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,303
We were busy washing clothes once.

166
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,894
Now we suffer without any work.

167
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,498
Is this the only place in Madras?

168
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,303
There are 6 places like this in Madras.

169
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,902
If you need any more information
you have to ask the chief.

170
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:57,246
Is he the one you told us now?

171
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,653
Yes he is the one!

172
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:02,191
-Which TV channel you belong to?
-F TV.

173
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,793
I knew it when I saw her.

174
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:13,934
There is no one here called
Parithi as far as I know.

175
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,472
Where are those who were
on the opposite side?

176
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:23,474
Hit you..! They vacated this place
and went to Saidapet and Adayar.

177
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:30,019
-Why?
-They said this place have become dirty.

178
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:42,765
Are there anyone who has
migrated from here?

179
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:51,308
Is it Rajam?
It is me here.

180
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,967
-What's the name?
-Parithi!

181
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,169
His sister's name is Selvi.

182
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,247
Is there any one called Parithi, Selvi?

183
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,711
-How old is he?
-About 85 years.

184
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,984
..about 85. Please look for it.

185
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:04,318
Is it?

186
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,786
There is no one called Parithi there.

187
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,381
There is an old woman
called Selvi. You want her?

188
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,325
What?
The house is closed.

189
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,596
This is the address.
Ask someone nearby.

190
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,404
-Dear!
-What is it sir?

191
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:26,069
Do you know this guy?

192
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,281
There is no one like that.

193
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,008
There is no one like that.

194
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:36,819
You are asking a small girl.

195
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:38,354
Do you have any brain? Go.

196
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,230
Is it you?

197
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:51,629
Police would have come
in search of brother.

198
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:57,974
24.. 25..

199
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:59,833
-Come here.
-What sir?

200
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:03,247
-Where is this man now?
-He is our man.

201
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:04,706
Nice photograph!

202
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,051
-Where is his house?
-4th street and 3rd house!

203
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,054
Understand?

204
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,392
What happened?
What are you doing there?

205
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:23,058
-Did he say in Telugu?
-Did he?

206
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:50,016
No donkey is seen in this place?
There is one.

207
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,567
Ouch! Kalyani!

208
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:02,236
Brother!

209
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:13,273
Take care. Be careful!

210
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,658
Brother!

211
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,472
Is it your donkey?

212
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,032
Look brother!
Kalyani is walking!

213
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:13,171
I were not aware of that.

214
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:14,638
Whites have enough brain.

215
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,058
No washer man seems
to vacate that place.

216
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:58,344
Why are you doing atrocious?
Leave me

217
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,758
Is it the wages for us
for working for you lifelong?

218
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:12,165
Don't shout!

219
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,033
Had you gone your selves they
wouldn't have demolished the building.

220
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:15,571
Will we vacate if demolished?

221
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,163
We won't allow to build
your golf course.

222
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,175
It is our commissioner's instruction.

223
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,437
-If you don't follow it..
-Will you kill us?

224
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,037
How dare you?

225
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:25,308
We shouldn't beat..

226
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:27,314
We should punish only
who motivate them.

227
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,233
Will you leave if it is a girl?

228
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,702
Did they watch for the human beings?

229
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,568
They have totally ruined us!

230
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:29,509
-We have to..
-So what?

231
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:32,578
You mean to attack the
police for hitting the girl?

232
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:35,980
Isn't there any difference
between us and them?

233
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:37,578
There is.

234
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:41,453
They are ruling people,
and we are slaves!

235
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,916
They don't have a woman.

236
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:47,331
Even the child in the
womb is our enemy.

237
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,014
Come, man.

238
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,911
They don't know about hard work.

239
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:36,637
There is nothing wrong that what he say.

240
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:50,720
22.. 23..

241
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:54,995
24.. 25..

242
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,749
They haven't done anything.
Leave them sir.

243
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:22,087
Then.. Did you do that murder?
This is murder case.

244
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,627
They won't leave you.

245
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,685
You were adamant that you
wouldn't vacate the place.

246
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:27,830
Inform your relations.

247
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,651
I don't understand anything.

248
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:02,057
Let them take the land.

249
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,194
We have to go 6 miles
to do the washing.

250
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,661
It is hard.

251
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,671
We can go and
fall on the commissioner's feet.

252
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,401
Go.

253
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:12,999
Fall on his feet.

254
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:18,472
They will ask for our houses.
Give it and fall in the river.

255
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,952
We have to fight for our problem.

256
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:23,813
We should have the guts..

257
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,821
You can keep your guts for yourself.

258
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,691
You have no children...

259
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:32,627
And after the wrestling always.
You're spoiling the boys lives meantime.

260
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:34,822
Will you give the life to the dead?

261
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:37,493
Put the signature in the document he gave.

262
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:15,262
Greetings madam.

263
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:39,958
You managed to delude this time.

264
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,096
But not next time.

265
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,299
Tell him that I told it.

266
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:02,577
Damn people..
have tortured him.

267
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:14,790
Drink the toddy!
Have it!

268
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,389
-You will be alright.
-Oh god!

269
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:22,729
If you've yelled there..
you could save the beatings.

270
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,003
What is the use coming and cry here?

271
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:26,867
It is painful man.

272
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,140
Don't you feel painful?

273
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:31,281
Where do you get the pain?

274
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:36,544
Hadn't she come to the station
they would have killed us.

275
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:37,882
Did she come to the station?

276
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,955
We didn't thank her.

277
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:42,952
It is painful.

278
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:48,163
I should say thanks to her.

279
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,166
Is that all?

280
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:53,360
I will tell her.

281
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:55,162
What is he doing?

282
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:58,164
How can we go there?

283
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:04,343
Go man.

284
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:10,578
They won't allow me to sleep peacefully.

285
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,587
-Greetings.
-What do you want?

286
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:25,397
-You wore the whites dress
and have come. -Who is it?

287
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,001
-Nothing!
-Our boys.

288
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:28,935
I will be back.

289
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:33,469
What? At this awful time?

290
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:36,205
-We want a hello from you.
-What help?

291
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:38,076
We want to tell thanks!

292
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,473
Why should you tell all that?

293
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:42,083
You are the boys of this place.

294
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:44,484
It is my duty to hello you.
Don't take it serious!

295
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:46,749
-Damn help!
-Go to bed.

296
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:48,357
Sir..!

297
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,629
-What is it?
-You have to help us.

298
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:55,431
-What?
-We have to say 'Thank you.'

299
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:58,034
..and in English!

300
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:45,142
Wait! Who are you all?

301
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:24,972
-Rascals!
-What?

302
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:28,447
Not brandy.. whiskey.
Without ice.

303
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:33,647
-4 people came in and..
-Is it? -I mean 4!

304
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:35,788
Wearing suit and without chappals.

305
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:38,292
Where? In his house?

306
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,522
Are you Hindi?

307
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:46,693
Somewhere here.
They will get caught by me.

308
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:49,134
I will see to them..!

309
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:24,432
-Come please.
-Sir, Parithi..

310
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:52,146
Ok Thank you!

311
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:12,201
She is calling you sir.

312
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:20,739
It is the whites calling and
you stand on their side.

313
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:35,225
Day light robbery.

314
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:46,473
-Are you Selvi?
-Yes she is the one you are looking for.

315
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:48,577
Were you in Washermanpet?

316
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,044
Yes! We have recently
vacated the place and came.

317
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:52,513
Is Parithi her brother?

318
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:54,641
Yes. Her brother's name is also Parithi.

319
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:55,979
Will you keep quiet?

320
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:57,917
You have to believe when I say this far.

321
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:00,512
She is Selvi! Here is the ID card.

322
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,791
-Do you know her?
-Of course

323
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,921
Grandma should have forgotten!

324
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:09,464
Will you keep quiet for a moment?

325
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:14,066
I am Selvi. Not the one
you are looking for.

326
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,399
She really is mad.

327
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:17,803
I've no brother named Parithi.

328
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:21,874
I am kept here that I will get a lot..

329
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:24,879
..of money from these rich people.

330
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:28,778
Or else, they will fight
with me after you leave.

331
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:36,089
83,515 people are there
in the name Parithi.

332
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,159
6,800 people are there
who are 80 years and above.

333
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:46,160
4,15,813 people are in Selvi's name.

334
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:50,636
15,815 people are there
who are 75 years and above.

335
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:53,167
If you start to search from today..

336
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,574
..you could find her in 3 years!

337
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:58,178
Parithi is very easy.

338
00:51:58,482 --> 00:51:59,380
Only an year.

339
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:00,711
Do you think it is fun?

340
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:03,251
Really? It is you creating fun!

341
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,583
You lost him when the
population was 35 crores.

342
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:09,249
..and are looking for him in 110 crores.

343
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,192
That too with the help of a photograph
taken 60 years ago.

344
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,455
Nothing can be done.

345
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:14,996
You have to find
with the help of the name.

346
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:16,531
Don't you have any notion?

347
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,533
What if we bring a photo taken recently?

348
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:21,066
With that we can match
with the voters ID list.

349
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:22,399
We can find out in 1½ an hour.

350
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,274
-There is no chance then.
-Why sir?

351
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:28,071
In the voters ID list you give,
no photo in that looks like us!

352
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:41,083
I don't draw any pictures
to any one generally.

353
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:43,625
Murali sir has come and asked me..

354
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:44,819
..and I couldn't deny.

355
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:48,498
How much will it cost?

356
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:51,360
I don't ask any money as
God has given me this art.

357
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:56,238
Still, it will cost 70 rupees
for the paint and brush.

358
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:59,170
-You can pay me for that.
-70 rupees.

359
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:00,766
I don't ask any money extra.

360
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,572
You wait for 1½ an hour.

361
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:00,766
7..

362
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,166
13..

363
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:08,301
Run..!

364
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:21,582
-Thank god! She has gone.
-Thank god we have escaped.

365
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:38,663
We want to thank her.

366
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:40,839
They are thanking you.

367
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,411
We only thank you.

368
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:50,883
If you don't come..

369
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:54,547
If you didn't save me..

370
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:58,155
We don't know how what to say..

371
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:07,695
-Both are the same.
-Is it(auna)? -Auna??

372
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:09,765
That damn guys..

373
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:14,966
They are going to out bomb.

374
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,113
They are going to out bomb.

375
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,132
No what(duck)!
It is the bomb.

376
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:37,129
Bomb?

377
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:55,016
It is really funny. Will anyone drop
bombs from a passenger flight?

378
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:57,417
Who cheated you like this?

379
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:07,894
Catch him.

380
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:09,760
Don't leave, catch.

381
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:12,029
They are not offering
any food, get away.

382
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:34,380
She wants to sightsee the city.
Will you take her?

383
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:13,059
Welcome madam of Britain.

384
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,964
This is the Bay of Bengal.

385
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:19,965
He is singing!

386

Welcome madam of Britain.

387
00:57:23,139 --> 00:57:25,573
This is the Bay of Bengal.

388
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:30,576
We welcome people by saying 'Greeting'!

389
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:33,906
-Greeting!
-That's it

390
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:35,712
We travel in the bullock cart.

391
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:38,183
We travel in the tram too!

392
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:42,256
We travel in the canal boat.
Shall we go?

393
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:47,326
There is snake dance to watch!

394
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:52,533
There is blessing by an elephant's trunk!

395
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:57,273
There are many wonders here,
oh...mom!

396
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:00,867
Welcome madam of Britain.

397
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:03,478
This is the Bay of Bengal.

398
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:08,673
We welcome people by saying 'Greeting'!

399
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:54,260
Doll dance.. puppetry and
art in the temple statues!

400
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,924
We draw designs on
the floor with rice powder..

401
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:59,331
..which is the food
for the birds and ants.

402
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:09,001
Even if there are
millions of religions here..

403
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:14,012
..we live like brothers.

404
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:23,815
We build our houses with lanai

405
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:28,692
For the travelers
to take rest on their way

406
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:33,267
We consider mother as God!

407
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:36,906
Welcome madam of Britain.

408
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:39,438
This is the Bay of Bengal.

409
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:44,579
We welcome people by saying 'Greeting'!

410
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:22,749
Our Tamil language has
a million year old heritage!

411
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:25,412
Kamban and Valluvan told in their life..

412
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:27,819
..which is our ethics!

413
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,558
Will she understand what I say?

414
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:37,826
You can go anywhere you like.

415
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:42,361
You will get love only from here.

416
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,108
Thank God!

417
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:52,341
Brave kings had been living here madam.

418
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:58,349
Can you justify the atrocity
of making us slaves?

419
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:06,720
Be quiet. Don't spoil my living.

420
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:14,058
-The mountain is trapped.
-Yes!

421
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,599
Welcome madam of Britain.

422
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,139
This is the Bay of Bengal.

423
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:26,270
We welcome people by saying 'Greeting'!

424
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:28,810
We travel in the bullock cart.

425
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:31,279
We travel in the tram too!

426
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:35,280
We travel in the canal boat.
Shall we go?

427
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:40,492
There is snake dance to watch!

428
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:45,498
There is blessing by an elephant's trunk!

429
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:50,372
There are many wonders here,
oh...mom!

430
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,258
She likes your country.

431
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:21,664
She likes your donkey.

432
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,077
What are you doing here?

433
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:41,087
It is our city, isn't it?

434
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:43,087
I asked you why you
are here at this time?

435
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:45,683
I heard the news in the radio!

436
01:02:46,062 --> 01:02:49,156
I wanted to send 2 letters to Nethaji.

437
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:50,698
How will it reach him
as he is not anywhere?

438
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:54,167
Do you know it?

439
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,363
I will post the letters!
Give them to me.

440
01:02:56,472 --> 01:02:57,700
You start from here.

441
01:02:58,141 --> 01:02:59,904
You can out it!
But I want to hear the news.

442
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:03,240
Listen to me sir. Sir!

443
01:03:20,897 --> 01:03:23,263
Hail freedom!

444
01:03:23,499 --> 01:03:25,797
Long live Bagath Singh!

445
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:29,732
Long Live Rajaji!

446
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:34,203
Victory for Motherland

447
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:39,342
I warn the British empire that
rules our Mother India!

448
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:44,077
In a month, you have to
remove your constructions..

449
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:46,280
..from our land and
go back to your country.

450
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:49,847
If not, post office, railway station
and other public places..

451
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:51,290
..will be demolished with the bombs!

452
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:53,154
I swear it on the Mother India !

453
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:09,044
It is not life that falls but seeds.

454
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:17,043
Hail freedom!

455
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:22,382
Victory to Mother India!

456
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:37,865
Victory to Mother India!

457
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,932
Your son has gone to jail
to achieve independence!

458
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:45,601
Be proud to be his father.

459
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:49,269
What independence?
Will it offer us food?

460
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:54,013
I was happy that my son
will look after us!

461
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:58,484
My daughter-in-law
has died delivering a child.

462
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:01,746
My son has gone to jail now.

463
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:06,693
How can I do the washing now
by coming that far carrying her?

464
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:11,566
It is food that is very important.
Land and independence can be later.

465
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:23,571
-Not me!
-What is it dear?

466
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:25,840
You told me that you have fever.
But your body is not hot.

467
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:30,176
It is not my body..
they will shoot me if I go there.

468
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:33,380
Don't blabber!
Go to the governor's house!

469
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:39,058
If I go now there,
you will have to see me as dead.

470
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:42,062
Ouch! What happened to you?

471
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:49,669
That girl is close to that boy
without knowing to the governor.

472
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:53,272
It will be dangerous if came
to know that I went with them.

473
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,209
What are you looking at?

474
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:02,011
Something is drawn in the cloth.

475
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:08,747
-Isn't this the white's cloth?
-Yes.

476
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:10,422
Kabir brother!

477
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:17,699
Greetings sir.

478
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:21,031
-Who is it?
-It's nothing, I'll come now.

479
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:23,897
Is it in the day?

480
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:29,105
-What do you want?
-A hello.

481
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:30,838
Why do you bother me?

482
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,311
Go and come in the evening.

483
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:36,249
Please come sir.

484
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:41,252
Brave man..

485
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:46,923
..meet me at 4 pm.

486
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:49,259
-What does it mean?
-It is some Brahmin...

487
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:51,265
..wants to meet in the
evening at 4 at the river side.

488
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:53,392
This is not for you.
This is for someone.

489
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:54,594
Go and mind your work.

490
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:33,204
You..

491
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:37,109
You are teaching as your wish.
What is the meaning of all these?

492
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:43,511
It is like the Tamil alphabets.
Understand?

493
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:45,717
Tell it!

494
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:55,194
Wait!

495
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:57,991
-Whom are you trying to cheat?
-What?

496
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:01,126
-You told that is like Tamil alphabets.
-Yes.

497
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:04,565
-What is it after A?
-What is it? -Aaaa

498
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:08,872
-After B?
-Beee!

499
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:12,345
-What is after C?
-Ceee! -Understand?

500
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:13,739
I understood.

501
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:15,817
Now teach them well..
or else you won't go home.

502
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:21,749
-Whom they are trying to cheat.
-They are trying to bother me much.

503
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:37,563
Tell me!

504
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:44,706
You can't understand anything

505
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:11,802
You would better do broker business
instead of this work.

506
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:14,740
Leave it. They got it from us
and we're now getting it back.

507
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:16,276
Are you Kattabomman's son?

508
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:19,609
Beat him.

509
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:25,613
If you are a woman,
come out

510
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:28,819
Come to me
face to face

511
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:30,824
Who gave him money to drink?

512
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:32,826
-Don't abuse him!
-Don't blabber.

513
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:35,494
I can't stand him as he gets drunk!

514
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:37,632
It is you who bothers me.

515
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:40,833
It is my brush and paint.

516
01:10:40,936 --> 01:10:44,497
-I can do what I want to. -Is it
with that money you did all this havoc?

517
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:46,040
-Wait! I will come.
-Look!

518
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:47,233
Look! She's fleeing as she got scared.

519
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:50,972
What is this Ravi?
All are watching you.

520
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:53,647
-Who..?
-We all..

521
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:56,843
We are wife and husband..
don't interfere into us.

522
01:10:57,219 --> 01:10:58,777
What are you doing inside?

523
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:01,378
-Sir, she is calling you.
-Come out!

524
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:04,250
Don't show me..

525
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:12,056
You got 70 rupees for the paint
and brush. Where is the painting?

526
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:14,666
Take it.

527
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:17,138
-What? -Your paintings!
-Oh my god!

528
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:20,072
Beat him well.

529
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:21,733
Damn it! Take this.

530
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:25,542
Why do you beat him
instead of beating me?

531
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:27,142
It was me..!

532
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:54,971
-My grandpa!
-He was doing fine!

533
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:57,637
He has seen the good
and bad in his life.

534
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:00,240
-Who is he sir?
-Be quiet.

535
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:03,376
-He is laughing sir.
-Cut it man.

536
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:05,381
-Cut!
-It was him who was laughing.

537
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:07,387
-I don't want it that way.
-Let's use the photograph.

538
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:09,582
You get up.
Bring the camera here.

539
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:12,861
-Come. -Touch up, come here.
-Keep grandpa's photo here.

540
01:12:13,228 --> 01:12:14,786
Bring the tea.

541
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:16,455
Who are you sir?
What do you want?

542
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,931
These photos say
madras images.com..

543
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:22,796
Those are ours

544
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:23,997
How did you get them?

545
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:25,539
How did you get them?

546
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:29,471
Why? It was she
who took the photos!

547
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:35,472
What is it man? We need an old man's
photograph for the next shot.

548
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:39,683
-What sir? -Open the shelf
and give the photo to them.

549
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:41,185
Come on!

550
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:44,818
These were taken in
auction in my dad's time.

551
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:53,762
She asks who has
let these in auction.

552
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:55,759
Brother! This is a site
for film shooting.

553
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:57,566
If you wish you can give
your phone number.

554
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:00,300
I'll call you later after
I take it from the old ledger.

555
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:05,846
Each copy is Rs.2500.
Is it ok for you?

556
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:12,252
These are your grandoa's
collections, isn't it?

557
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:13,651
Why did you lie to them?

558
01:13:14,089 --> 01:13:16,649
Someone comes and
say she took those photos.

559
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:18,119
Later they'll ask for royalty.

560
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:19,922
Then, am I mad to save this?

561
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:22,393
Come make up.
Go quickly.

562
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:25,667
Leave it dear. Don't cry.

563
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:29,462
-He was living well.
-He has seen many good things.

564
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:32,407
We can't see a man like him.

565
01:13:34,309 --> 01:13:35,867
Where has he gone?

566
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:10,639
I know only four words in English.
I said those words only.

567
01:14:10,746 --> 01:14:12,179
But you don't come.

568
01:14:48,183 --> 01:14:49,411
Have you forgotten?

569
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,829
The moment when the flowers blossomed

570
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:16,307
..and nobody has seen that.

571
01:15:17,412 --> 01:15:19,903
The moment it was dawn..

572
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:23,974
..and nobody seems to have enjoyed it.

573
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:27,918
Until yesterday l was idle!

574
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:32,527
When l am with you
the time is not enough.

575
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:35,929
l didn't talk anything to you..

576
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:41,401
..and l did not have anything
to say now. Why so?

577
01:15:45,507 --> 01:15:47,873
The night is not dawned yet.

578
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:53,608
..and the day has not come to an end.

579
01:16:57,512 --> 01:17:01,414
Words are not needed as long we are alive!

580
01:17:01,516 --> 01:17:04,747
We can convey our feelings
through our eyes!

581
01:17:05,387 --> 01:17:09,551
We don't need yesterday or tomorrow!

582
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:13,150
The moment now today is good enough.

583
01:17:13,528 --> 01:17:21,367
His garden blooms without
plants and shower

584
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:29,844
He has won my heart
without bloodshed.

585
01:17:30,012 --> 01:17:33,448
The hesitation in my heart..

586
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:36,107
Don't know when this will end

587
01:17:36,218 --> 01:17:44,182
Where will I get a clarification?
Tell me if you find out.

588
01:19:09,711 --> 01:19:16,947
The rain has come as
a surprise to drench us.

589
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:25,357
Though I don't understand
this relation I enjoy it.

590
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:29,561
I didn't know him and his name..

591
01:19:29,664 --> 01:19:33,361
..and a relation was born among us.

592
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:41,634
My mind disobeys me and
trails wherever he goes

593
01:19:41,743 --> 01:19:44,234
The path has come to an end..

594
01:19:44,346 --> 01:19:48,442
..but the journey is not
yet over in this world.

595
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:52,179
Even if the birds
vanish in the sky..

596
01:19:52,287 --> 01:20:00,661
..the dance that started
doesn't stop. Why so?

597
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:06,994
PARITHI!

598
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:09,195
You are nice.

599
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:12,206
Mom told me.

600
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,544
She died when I was born.

601
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:20,809
This is her sacred thread.

602
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:22,813
This is our treasure.

603
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:25,212
He has saved it
for his fiancee.

604
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:47,240
The moment when
the flowers blossomed

605
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:50,311
..and nobody has seen that.

606
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:53,837
The moment it was dawn..

607
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:57,976
..and nobody seems
to have enjoyed it.

608
01:20:58,086 --> 01:21:01,852
Until yesterday I was idle!

609
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:06,257
When I am with you
the time is not enough.

610
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:09,853
I didn't talk anything to you..

611
01:21:09,965 --> 01:21:15,597
..and I did not have anything
to say now. Why so?

612
01:21:19,274 --> 01:21:21,799
The night is not dawned yet.

613
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:28,679
..and the day has not come
to an end. Why so?

614
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:04,979
I'll graze many donkeys.

615
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:06,177
What is your ambition?

616
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:08,977
I'll become a big
launderer like my dad.

617
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:14,987
-And you? -I'll become a
wrestler like Iyya kannu

618
01:23:15,223 --> 01:23:16,986
What is your ambition?

619
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:21,922
I'll become a Governor
like my father.

620
01:23:22,764 --> 01:23:25,130
What will you do
if you become a governor?

621
01:23:28,036 --> 01:23:31,130
If I become a Governor
I'll build big schools.

622
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:33,867
I'll build hospitals for poor people.

623
01:23:33,975 --> 01:23:37,206
I'll build big colleges for you.

624
01:23:37,312 --> 01:23:38,677
Why should we need that?

625
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:41,681
Will you return us our place?

626
01:24:00,335 --> 01:24:04,362
-What is the problem?
-This place belongs to government.

627
01:24:04,806 --> 01:24:06,171
We've got orders to
clear them from here.

628
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:08,439
Already you took everything.

629
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:10,238
Now, why do you ask this too?

630
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,714
-I'll talk to him.
-Governor only has issued this.

631
01:24:44,112 --> 01:24:48,606
Are you crazy?
Show your anger to Parithi only.

632
01:24:48,716 --> 01:24:53,016
Don't show your power to poor people.

633
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:55,352
I have that guts.

634
01:24:56,124 --> 01:24:59,093
If he has guts
ask him to come.

635
01:25:04,999 --> 01:25:06,159
What if he wins..

636
01:25:06,534 --> 01:25:08,764
I'll give the whole place to them.

637
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:11,365
What if I win..

638
01:25:12,407 --> 01:25:14,102
I won't come here.

639
01:25:26,087 --> 01:25:26,883
Sit down buddy.

640
01:26:09,464 --> 01:26:12,024
You said it is wresting
but you are boxing.

641
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,165
No rules while fighting.

642
01:26:14,602 --> 01:26:16,365
Who is the winner,
that is only important.

643
01:26:16,938 --> 01:26:19,168
-Hit me.
-Sir!

644
01:26:19,274 --> 01:26:21,708
-Hit me, leave me.
-Come sir.

645
01:26:21,809 --> 01:26:23,037
There is a rule for fighting.

646
01:26:23,144 --> 01:26:25,374
-He is creating new Law.
Leave me. -Please come!

647
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:28,574
See, what I'll do to him.
I'll beat you. Leave me.

648
01:27:11,593 --> 01:27:13,686
We are hitting them after 400 years.

649
01:27:30,211 --> 01:27:33,112
1.. 2..

650
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:36,376
3.. 4..

651
01:28:23,865 --> 01:28:26,698
If you want to win
you have to hit him.

652
01:29:19,921 --> 01:29:21,752
-Hit him like that.
-Hit him well

653
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:23,406
1.. 2..

654
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:30,618
3.. 4.. 5..

655
01:31:01,689 --> 01:31:02,849
Sir!

656
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:24,141
Sister!

657
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:42,092
Victory to mother India!

658
01:31:42,196 --> 01:31:45,290
Victory to mother India.

659
01:31:45,399 --> 01:31:47,833
Victory to mother India!

660
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:19,466
-Hey, leave me.
-Leave me.

661
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:20,598
Where do you..?

662
01:33:17,825 --> 01:33:19,122
May I come in?

663
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:22,654
It's confirmed that they'll go out.
Then?

664
01:33:22,763 --> 01:33:26,665
They swore that they'll give
freedom if we win in world war.

665
01:33:26,767 --> 01:33:27,665
Yes.

666
01:33:27,969 --> 01:33:28,867
Come all of you.

667
01:33:29,704 --> 01:33:30,671
Come.

668
01:33:33,975 --> 01:33:34,873
Careful!

669
01:33:44,185 --> 01:33:46,415
Tell me sir.
When will we get?

670
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:48,078
What we will do
if you tell like this.

671
01:33:48,189 --> 01:33:53,684
Tell me.
When will we get freedom?

672
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:07,373
Economical downfall in Britain.

673
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:09,636
They talk as if
they're voluntarily freeing us.

674
01:34:15,683 --> 01:34:18,777
We're waiting for long.
Tell us the exact date.

675
01:34:18,886 --> 01:34:19,716
When will you give?

676
01:34:31,032 --> 01:34:33,330
We were silent when
we didn't understand the language..

677
01:34:36,837 --> 01:34:38,395
What is the meaning of this silence?

678
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:53,683
I don't know.

679
01:34:55,189 --> 01:34:57,680
Why?
Because of me.

680
01:34:57,992 --> 01:34:59,016
How can you say like that?

681
01:34:59,126 --> 01:35:01,686
They've given you
the rights to give the freedom.

682
01:35:13,007 --> 01:35:14,975
You're saying this
for the last one year.

683
01:35:15,076 --> 01:35:16,304
Tell the correct date.

684
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:19,373
You change the sari.
I will..

685
01:35:40,901 --> 01:35:46,931
Tell the correct date.

686
01:35:58,119 --> 01:36:02,954
Victory to mother India!
Hail Mahatma Gandhiji!

687
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:13,226
What is there in India?

688
01:36:23,811 --> 01:36:25,438
You are rich people.

689
01:36:26,013 --> 01:36:27,708
You may give whatever you want.

690
01:36:29,083 --> 01:36:30,710
But we don't have anything to give.

691
01:36:36,223 --> 01:36:39,659
No, you have this sacred thread.

692
01:36:50,771 --> 01:36:51,601
Will you give me?

693
01:37:25,472 --> 01:37:27,303
You chatterbox.
Go and sit in the car

694
01:37:27,408 --> 01:37:28,966
Keep quiet.
Always you are going after money..

695
01:37:29,076 --> 01:37:31,442
You give only receipts for
getting paid instead of ideas

696
01:37:31,879 --> 01:37:33,642
You're wasting time
when you have sources

697
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:38,579
If we search a person like this
after so many years, we can't find him

698
01:37:39,286 --> 01:37:40,776
Then, how should we find him?

699
01:37:40,955 --> 01:37:45,051
Let us give an Ad for him
in all dailies of Tamil Nadu

700
01:37:45,159 --> 01:37:48,993
Won't we get a single friend or
relative among 60 million people?

701
01:37:56,770 --> 01:37:59,398
Lord Mountbatten has
declared Freedom for India

702
01:37:59,506 --> 01:38:02,202
Hot news.

01:38:05,179 --> 01:38:11,675

They gathered here to receive Kamarajar

713
01:38:46,487 --> 01:38:48,250
Who are you to give us permission?

714
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:28,717
My darling! My darling!

Even if you are lost,

725
01:42:12,993 --> 01:42:21,423
Will I mingle with breeze
and join your breath?

726
01:42:21,935 --> 01:42:27,896
I will not come out
with your breath.

727
01:42:28,008 --> 01:42:31,967
I will live in you.

728
01:42:32,679 --> 01:42:41,712
My soul! lt is your soul in me.

729
01:42:42,422 --> 01:42:47,189
I am crying thinking of you
and I melt down.

730

I am losing myself.

731
01:42:52,633 --> 01:42:57,332
My darling! My darling!

732
01:42:57,704 --> 01:43:02,141
I am living in your thoughts of love.

733
01:43:47,087 --> 01:43:55,256
I think of you even if I am killed.

734
01:43:57,164 --> 01:44:06,596
A love epic will end up in tears.

735
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:15,612
I'll live in your thoughts
I want to lean on your shoulders.

736
01:44:16,850 --> 01:44:21,753
By holding your fingers
and being in love..

737
01:44:21,855 --> 01:44:24,949
..I'll forget the time.

738
01:44:26,460 --> 01:44:35,892
Soul, my soul!
We two are one.

739
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:41,037
I cry thinking about us.

740
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:45,507
I sacrifice my life.

741
01:47:28,175 --> 01:47:29,073
I won't go

742
01:47:53,266 --> 01:47:56,235
I've given it.
It is for you only

743
01:47:58,605 --> 01:48:03,838
None of them can
take you from here

744
01:48:05,212 --> 01:48:09,308
Let it be life or death
It'll happen here only.

745
01:48:11,117 --> 01:48:11,913
Go

746
01:49:02,736 --> 01:49:04,829
What do you want?

747
01:49:05,338 --> 01:49:07,704
We don't know about your custom

748
01:49:07,807 --> 01:49:12,107
But we have a custom

749
01:49:12,212 --> 01:49:14,772
That's why we've come formally
with a marriage proposal

750
01:49:15,081 --> 01:49:18,107
How dare you come here with
a marriage proposal? Go away!

751
01:49:23,957 --> 01:49:25,515
Why do you yell?

752
01:49:26,693 --> 01:49:28,251
You ruled our country around 200 years

753
01:49:28,428 --> 01:49:31,056
Do you get annoyed when
we come with a proposal?

754
01:49:31,164 --> 01:49:31,994
What are you saying?

755
01:49:32,098 --> 01:49:33,326
Are you threatening the
Governor and Commissioner?

756
01:49:33,433 --> 01:49:36,664
Their portfolios are only till today.

757
01:49:36,970 --> 01:49:39,200
Tomorrow even our
cattle won't respect them.

758
01:49:42,108 --> 01:49:43,939
Shoot at us.

759
01:49:47,581 --> 01:49:50,072
Leave me.

760
01:49:50,450 --> 01:49:54,409
Sir, you are educated
and you have ruled our country.

761
01:49:54,654 --> 01:49:57,623
Understand your girl's mind.

762
01:49:58,325 --> 01:49:59,155
It will be good.

763
01:50:01,928 --> 01:50:04,362
Why should we have to beg
to them? What will they do?

764
01:50:04,464 --> 01:50:07,558
When that girl came to us
ignoring all of them..

765
01:50:07,667 --> 01:50:09,157
..she became a girl
of our family.

766
01:50:09,469 --> 01:50:11,437
No one can take her away from us.

767
01:50:11,871 --> 01:50:13,634
Something written in that madam's cloth.

768
01:50:13,807 --> 01:50:15,240
Look what is written in that.

769
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:47,736
Madam

770
01:51:39,959 --> 01:51:41,722
Who are you?

771
01:51:42,095 --> 01:51:44,325
How did you get this much guts?

772
01:51:45,565 --> 01:51:47,533
You got guts because
you're going to get freedom.

773
01:51:49,169 --> 01:51:50,932
You wouldn't see that.

774
01:53:25,665 --> 01:53:28,156
-Who has come with Emy Smith?
-One minute. -Come!

775
01:53:30,203 --> 01:53:32,831
One minute.
My grandpa is in 7th bed.

776
01:53:32,939 --> 01:53:34,497
Will you tie this in his hand?

777
01:53:34,607 --> 01:53:35,835
They're not allowing me.

778
01:54:02,769 --> 01:54:03,599
Sign here.

779
01:54:50,350 --> 01:54:51,578
Madam!

780
01:54:57,790 --> 01:54:59,485
Where is Parithi?

781
01:54:59,859 --> 01:55:03,022
I want to meet Parithi

782
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:22,980
I don't know who Parithi is.

783
01:55:23,483 --> 01:55:25,576
I lost my parents in my childhood.

784
01:55:25,752 --> 01:55:27,242
My grandpa only brought me up.

785
01:55:31,691 --> 01:55:34,524
What happened doctor?

786
01:55:35,561 --> 01:55:36,789

787
01:55:37,363 --> 01:55:41,459
Grandpa!

788
01:55:49,042 --> 01:55:50,873
Though you know
the Tamil language to speak..

789
01:55:51,778 --> 01:55:54,338
..you didn't speak
with us all these days.

790
01:55:58,117 --> 01:55:59,277
Who are you?

791
01:56:00,787 --> 01:56:02,345
Who is Parithi?

792
01:56:02,722 --> 01:56:05,088
What relationship is
between you and him?

793
01:56:06,592 --> 01:56:07,422
Oh God!

794
01:56:10,129 --> 01:56:13,292
Grandpa!

795
01:56:18,338 --> 01:56:24,106

Victory for Motherland!

803
02:00:33,526 --> 02:00:36,689
Governor sent her to Delhi
because we will create problem if she is here.

804
02:00:36,796 --> 02:00:38,423
They will bring her to London
after she get down there.

805
02:00:40,666 --> 02:00:41,963
Brother, I feel scared.

806
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:48,638
Nothing will happen.

807
02:00:51,344 --> 02:00:52,504

02:01:07,893 --> 02:01:11,727
Victory for Motherland!

815
02:01:13,165 --> 02:01:14,723
Which platform is the train to Delhi?

816
02:01:14,834 --> 02:01:16,802
Which platform is the train to Delhi?

817
02:01:32,184 --> 02:01:33,208

You can't go to Delhi at any time.

826
02:01:47,066 --> 02:01:48,158
Vehicle has gone.

02:01:48,267 --> 02:01:49,291

Long live Kamarajar!

870
02:07:43,288 --> 02:07:46,451
Even a thousand weapons
can't fight against love

871
02:07:46,558 --> 02:07:49,857
Darkness will vanish.
Brightness at dawn in the east.

872
02:07:50,229 --> 02:07:52,026
Even when ghosts and foxes chase..

873
02:07:52,131 --> 02:07:53,894
Even if the path is full of obstructions

874
02:07:53,999 --> 02:07:57,264
A flower blooms in the
war field amidst chaos

875
02:07:57,436 --> 02:07:59,336
A new dawn everywhere

876
02:08:05,077 --> 02:08:12,210
Dampness in the breeze increases..

877
02:08:12,418 --> 02:08:19,620
Tears in the eyes joins the breeze..

878
02:08:19,892 --> 02:08:22,918
We were two..

879
02:08:23,028 --> 02:08:27,192
now have become one

880
02:08:27,299 --> 02:08:30,393
Ours is an affectionate bond

881
02:08:30,502 --> 02:08:34,598
We've joined hands at the cost of tears

882
02:08:34,707 --> 02:08:38,199
Even a thousand weapons
can't fight against love

883
02:08:38,310 --> 02:08:41,609
Darkness will vanish.
Brightness at dawn in the east.

884
02:08:41,947 --> 02:08:43,744
Even when ghosts and foxes chase..

885
02:08:43,849 --> 02:08:45,612
Even if the path is full of obstructions

886
02:08:45,718 --> 02:08:48,915
A flower blooms in the
war field amidst chaos

887
02:08:50,089 --> 02:08:51,784
We tried well
but couldn't catch him!

888
02:08:51,957 --> 02:08:53,447
We will catch them before dawn.

889
02:08:53,559 --> 02:08:55,993
Don't catch them.
Kill them.

890
02:08:56,695 --> 02:08:58,663
Sir, that is..

891
02:09:33,065 --> 02:09:34,555
There is no one here.

892
02:09:52,818 --> 02:09:53,842
Tell me.

893
02:09:54,319 --> 02:09:55,718
Where have you hidden
the Governor's daughter?

894
02:09:55,888 --> 02:09:59,119
Sir, we came with the proposal formally.

895
02:09:59,291 --> 02:10:01,725
We have no necessity to hide them.

896
02:10:02,427 --> 02:10:05,521
If so, where are governor's
daughter and Parithi?

897
02:10:05,631 --> 02:10:07,531
We too are waiting for them.

898
02:10:07,633 --> 02:10:10,067
Now, you too wait for them.

899
02:10:10,202 --> 02:10:11,328
Sit down, all of you.

900
02:10:15,107 --> 02:10:19,737
Victory to Mother India!

901
02:10:19,845 --> 02:10:23,372
Running water can be
stopped by a dam

902
02:10:23,482 --> 02:10:26,940
no way to restrict the clouds

903
02:10:27,186 --> 02:10:30,747
Present is before the eyes,
future is a dream

904
02:10:30,856 --> 02:10:34,314
Destiny cannot be predicted

905
02:10:34,593 --> 02:10:38,029
night and day, summer and
winter are made for each other

906
02:10:38,230 --> 02:10:41,631
Will our union happen?

907
02:10:41,934 --> 02:10:45,495
This is the moment where dawn awaits..

908
02:10:45,637 --> 02:10:49,300
Will it dawn for us?

909
02:10:56,682 --> 02:10:58,479
Even when ghosts and foxes chase..

910
02:10:58,584 --> 02:11:00,313
Even if the path is full of obstructions

911
02:11:00,419 --> 02:11:03,855
A flower blooms in the
war field amidst chaos

912
02:11:11,897 --> 02:11:15,526
Hail Mother India

913
02:11:33,719 --> 02:11:35,482
One sky is not enough

914
02:11:35,587 --> 02:11:40,923
Wish for many skies to flee

915
02:11:41,026 --> 02:11:44,655
Dream for a long life
Let us hold our hands

916
02:11:44,763 --> 02:11:48,358
And stay united forever

917
02:11:48,467 --> 02:11:51,959
War throughout day and nights
A cuckoo sings faraway

918
02:11:52,104 --> 02:11:55,437
Hearts feel elated at hearing it

919
02:11:55,874 --> 02:11:59,332
Though at opponent sides

920
02:11:59,544 --> 02:12:03,105
But nothing stops us
from falling in love

921
02:12:03,282 --> 02:12:06,843
Even a thousand weapons
can't fight against love

922
02:12:06,952 --> 02:12:10,115
Darkness will vanish.
Brightness at dawn in the east.

923
02:12:10,622 --> 02:12:12,385
Even when ghosts and foxes chase..

924
02:12:12,491 --> 02:12:14,220
Even if the path is full of obstructions

925
02:12:14,326 --> 02:12:17,659
A flower blooms in the
war field amidst chaos

926
02:12:18,030 --> 02:12:25,300
Dampness in the breeze increases..

927
02:12:25,437 --> 02:12:32,673
Tears in the eyes joins the breeze..

928
02:12:32,911 --> 02:12:36,039
We were two..

929
02:12:36,148 --> 02:12:40,107
now have become one

930
02:12:40,218 --> 02:12:43,449
Ours is an affectionate bond

931
02:12:43,555 --> 02:12:48,458
We've joined hands at the cost of tears

932
02:13:21,026 --> 02:13:22,186
Don't kill him.

933
02:13:23,562 --> 02:13:24,654
I want to speak with him.

934
02:13:43,181 --> 02:13:45,206
Shoot at sight is announced
when you were seen.

935
02:13:48,920 --> 02:13:50,615
Government is to be changed
when it is dawn.

936
02:13:50,989 --> 02:13:55,483
If you stay here till then,
I could offer protection for you.

937
02:13:58,797 --> 02:14:01,357
This is not the time
to examine your heart.

938
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:04,360
You should see how intelligent
you are in running your life!

939
02:14:05,537 --> 02:14:06,970
Listen what I say.

940
02:14:28,827 --> 02:14:31,921
Sir! This is Railway area.
I'm telling it time and again. Leave this place.

941
02:14:32,030 --> 02:14:33,930
You won't be admitted.

942
02:14:34,032 --> 02:14:37,661
I'm inquiring him
if anybody has come here.

943
02:14:38,904 --> 02:14:40,531
Sir! Nobody can
come here at once.

944
02:14:40,639 --> 02:14:42,800
Even you are not allowed.
Start now.

945
02:14:52,784 --> 02:14:54,149
Key is in the head office.

946
02:14:54,453 --> 02:14:55,545
This is clock room's door.

947
02:14:55,654 --> 02:14:57,212
Nobody can go without permission.

948
02:14:57,722 --> 02:14:59,485
It is time for me.
I have to close the main gate.

949
02:14:59,591 --> 02:15:01,286
You start now.
Come.

950
02:15:46,304 --> 02:15:47,669
No way here!
Come!

951
02:15:50,709 --> 02:15:51,607
No.

952
02:15:54,379 --> 02:15:56,847
-In this situation..
-I am alright. Come.

953
02:15:59,451 --> 02:16:03,751
As SP said let us move
from here after dawn.

954
02:16:23,074 --> 02:16:26,771
Leave me!

955
02:16:27,612 --> 02:16:31,571
Ask him to leave me.

956
02:16:33,618 --> 02:16:34,642
He says that he is dumb.

957
02:16:35,020 --> 02:16:36,920
Ask him to leave him.

958
02:16:37,422 --> 02:16:39,583
He is a dumb.
Tell him to leave.

959
02:16:39,824 --> 02:16:41,257
-Leave him.
-Tell him.

960
02:16:41,426 --> 02:16:42,256
Leave him.

961
02:16:44,095 --> 02:16:46,859
What happened to you?
Tell me!

962
02:16:46,965 --> 02:16:48,728
What happened?

963
02:17:01,713 --> 02:17:04,682
Now, you tell me.
Where are they?

964
02:17:48,627 --> 02:17:49,594
It's paining.

965
02:18:19,257 --> 02:18:20,349
The time is five.

966
02:18:22,794 --> 02:18:24,352
Don't know where they are

967
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:27,632
Whether they will be found..

968
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:29,967
They will get caught.

969
02:18:31,970 --> 02:18:33,164
At 12 am..

970
02:18:33,305 --> 02:18:36,035
.. they've escaped from the central
and taken the Wall Tax road.

971
02:18:36,141 --> 02:18:40,578
There had been a fight with
Daniel team at 1 am in Ordinance line!

972
02:18:40,679 --> 02:18:42,840
By escaping from there,
they've taken Mint street..

973
02:18:42,947 --> 02:18:48,385
Around 2 am, they hit Alex and
Samuels near Salt Cotaurs

974
02:18:48,620 --> 02:18:53,717
Again escaping in Calcutta mail,
they've come to Central station

975
02:18:54,225 --> 02:18:57,524
They've have not
come out of Central!

976
02:23:46,918 --> 02:23:47,850
Madam!

977
02:25:29,487 --> 02:25:33,184
What is that noise?
Someone has jumped!

978
02:25:46,804 --> 02:25:48,066
Someone pushed him.

979
02:26:09,727 --> 02:26:12,025
-Parithi! What happened to you?
-Nothing.

980
02:26:12,497 --> 02:26:13,395
Come.

981
02:26:23,541 --> 02:26:24,974
Bhagat Singh, hail!

982
02:26:25,076 --> 02:26:26,566
Hail Sugavel.

983
02:26:28,279 --> 02:26:31,180
Hail Bhagat Singh and Sugavel!

984
02:26:31,282 --> 02:26:32,840
Hail Rajaguru.

985
02:27:49,660 --> 02:27:50,957
Where are they?

986
02:30:27,251 --> 02:30:30,414
Go away!
I don't need you. Go!

987
02:31:20,538 --> 02:31:22,438
Didn't you return to India after that?

988
02:31:24,742 --> 02:31:25,538
Why?

989
02:31:29,880 --> 02:31:30,847
Fate

990
02:31:31,348 --> 02:31:34,715
After so long..

991
02:31:35,152 --> 02:31:37,780
You don't even know
whether he is dead or alive.

992
02:31:37,955 --> 02:31:39,320
Why're you searching for him now?

993
02:31:40,891 --> 02:31:42,051
It is for this

994
02:31:47,231 --> 02:31:51,065
This belongs to Parithi..

995
02:31:51,969 --> 02:31:54,802
..and his wife now

996
02:31:55,306 --> 02:31:59,265
I should give it to its rightful owner

997
02:32:09,587 --> 02:32:12,613
-You had given an Ad in the newspaper.
-Yes, who is this?

998
02:32:13,190 --> 02:32:16,887
-How do you know Parithi sir?
-I don't but..

999
02:32:16,994 --> 02:32:19,087
You don't know but
why're you searching him?

1000
02:32:19,196 --> 02:32:21,027
Do you know him?

1001
02:32:21,132 --> 02:32:25,694
I don't know who you are.
Please come in person.

1002
02:32:26,003 --> 02:32:28,369
Please give your address.

1003
02:32:29,206 --> 02:32:33,233
No.4, Apparsamy Koil Street,
Mylapore, Chennai -4.

1004
02:32:35,946 --> 02:32:37,243
I will come

1005
02:33:19,657 --> 02:33:21,147
Our London lady.

1006
02:33:25,462 --> 02:33:27,430
Where is your grand daughter
and luggage?

1007
02:33:32,002 --> 02:33:34,300
They said they'll if I enquire
with the telephone exchange

1008
02:33:34,405 --> 02:33:35,303
That number only.

1009
02:33:43,080 --> 02:33:45,514
Please give that number at least

1010
02:33:51,889 --> 02:33:53,117
I'll call you back

1011
02:33:55,693 --> 02:33:58,924
-What happened sir?
-Here is the impression of what I wrote

1012
02:33:59,563 --> 02:34:00,530
What is the address?

1013
02:34:01,832 --> 02:34:05,268
4, Apparsamy Koil Street,
Mylapore

1014
02:34:05,369 --> 02:34:08,668
4, Apparsamy..
The address we went earlier

1015
02:34:23,187 --> 02:34:24,211
Come fast!

1016
02:34:44,141 --> 02:34:45,768
Do you have the taxi fare at least?

1017
02:35:04,028 --> 02:35:06,861
Where is Duraiammal trust?

1018
02:35:12,102 --> 02:35:14,002
You're talking in Tamil

1019
02:35:14,305 --> 02:35:16,865
Do you know that place?

1020
02:35:17,441 --> 02:35:20,410
What're you saying?
I grew up there only

1021
02:35:20,511 --> 02:35:22,536
Go to that trust

1022
02:35:23,981 --> 02:35:25,608
Do you want to donate?

1023
02:35:26,317 --> 02:35:31,414
Even if you had asked a kid on the day
you came you could've gone there

1024
02:35:32,656 --> 02:35:34,089
If you had come in my taxi that day..

1025
02:35:34,191 --> 02:35:36,091
..you would've finished your work
and gone back home by now

1026
02:35:54,144 --> 02:35:57,113
The old lady who came with us is Duraiamma

1027
02:35:57,481 --> 02:36:00,712
All these days we were
searching for Parithi sir only

1028
02:36:02,486 --> 02:36:04,454
All these are run by that trust only

1029
02:36:04,888 --> 02:36:07,254
It was started as
a small school in 1967

1030
02:36:07,358 --> 02:36:10,054
It got expanded to
many schools and colleges

1031
02:36:11,028 --> 02:36:14,725
Our sir is not educated
but he speaks English nicely.

1032
02:36:15,165 --> 02:36:19,659
Everything is sponsored
by Duraiammal Trust

1033
02:36:20,771 --> 02:36:22,068
You can donate confidently

1034
02:36:26,777 --> 02:36:29,268
This is Duraiammal Trust Road

1035
02:36:31,181 --> 02:36:34,275
Our sir fought with the
authorities to name the road as such

1036
02:36:36,854 --> 02:36:40,085
Look there. That is
Duraiammal Charity Hospital.

1037
02:36:41,191 --> 02:36:44,285
Here there is no difference
between the rich and the poor

1038
02:36:44,795 --> 02:36:46,820
All are treated equally.

1039
02:36:49,066 --> 02:36:50,294
You can donate confidently

1040
02:36:52,002 --> 02:36:54,300
This is Duraiammal Engineering College

1041
02:36:54,671 --> 02:36:56,161
Fee is cheaper than Government rates.

1042
02:36:56,340 --> 02:36:59,036
But our sir sponsors
for half of the students

1043
02:37:01,145 --> 02:37:05,912
Look there. Duraiammal Old age home.

1044
02:37:06,417 --> 02:37:09,113
After this was instituted
old people refuse to go home..

1045
02:37:09,286 --> 02:37:10,446
..because of the facilities they get here

1046
02:37:11,288 --> 02:37:13,449
You can stay here for two days
and then give the donation.

1047
02:37:18,362 --> 02:37:20,728
Here we are.
This is our sir's office.

1048
02:37:32,042 --> 02:37:32,940
Come madam.

1049
02:37:43,587 --> 02:37:47,751
She is Duraiammal.
Our God.

1050
02:37:49,460 --> 02:37:51,690
She only aspired to build all these.

1051
02:37:52,196 --> 02:37:54,892
Or else can kids of parents
like me go to school?

1052
02:37:55,065 --> 02:37:58,364
lf l become a Governor
l'll build big schools.

1053
02:37:58,469 --> 02:38:01,165
l'll build hospitals for poor people.

1054
02:38:01,271 --> 02:38:04,832
l'll build big colleges for you.

1055
02:38:08,412 --> 02:38:11,108
Her fate.
She died when she was young.

1056
02:38:14,218 --> 02:38:16,186
Our sir didn't marry after that.

1057
02:38:19,756 --> 02:38:20,780
Velu, how come you are here?

1058
02:38:21,091 --> 02:38:24,857
Sir, this madam is from London.
I think she has come to donate.

1059
02:38:25,362 --> 02:38:28,331
Donating is not so simple.
There are some formalities.

1060
