1
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:23,005
"Mr. Kailash, sorry we could"
save neither mother nor child

2
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:59,441
It's so tragic. His
wife and child died.

3
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:05,219
- And nature tricks him.
- But he'll be well in a month

4
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,990
- He will be well but...
- What?

5
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,258
He won't be able to marry.

6
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,459
He can never father a child.

7
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:47,089
"My son, peace can only"
be found with in the heart.

8
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:53,094
The restless heart
seeks peace in nature.

9
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,873
Our sages seek refuge in
the Himalayas to attain peace.

10
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,580
The Himalayan range is a
still sea of tranquility.

11
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,780
The most fretful heart
finds serenity in its' lap.

12
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:44,884
Strange are the ways of fate

13
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,151
Strange are the ways of fate

14
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,159
Who can escape destiny?

15
00:03:56,703 --> 00:04:00,935
Strange are the ways of fate

16
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:11,172
Providence holds
"the key to our lives""

17
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,783
You can't fight fate

18
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:20,852
Everything is in its' power

19
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:46,218
Darkness of despair will
"pale if you are fated joys""

20
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:51,223
Someday you'll find light

21
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,244
The lofty H imalayas
"are the true pilgrimage""

22
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,238
The temple of the mind
"the abode of peacefullness""

23
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:22,853
You'll find joys here

24
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,885
ch ief i nstructor si r and friends

25
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:07,288
For the past 7 years I 'm not
managing Mountai neering clu b.

26
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,303
It runs on your youthful daring

27
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:17,298
These gigantic hills spread out
like the ups and downs of life.

28
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,307
But those with courage and hope...

29
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,315
...find the way
and the destination.

30
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,314
This land touches the sky

31
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,115
people come from
afar to reach it.

32
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:38,920
This is Amar Kumar who has come
here from Africa to climb it.

33
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,337
There are 5 kinds of
basic mountaineering.

34
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:59,340
Can anyone of you tell
me how we should begin?

35
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:17,156
- Listen... that...
- Stop stammering.

36
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,091
Don't I have a name?
My name is Somna.

37
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:27,438
"- Somna, our ball came this way."
- So it did. Now it's leaving.

38
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,840
How funny. Return the ball.

39
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,768
- Why?
- It's ours.

40
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,946
But it fell in my garden.

41
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,246
- Everything that comes to your
garden is yours? - Absolutely.

42
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,785
- Then may I come?
- Sure.

43
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,458
I 'll turn you into an apple
and hang you on a tree.

44
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,791
I don't mind as long
as you look after me.

45
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:51,861
I 'll eat you raw!

46
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,296
Where are you going?

47
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,863
Am I your servant to
keep picking y our ball?

48
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,474
The ball always falls here
as if it were a play ground!

49
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:08,212
- You wont' get it!
- He y... you'll regret this.

50
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:15,881
- Where did y ou get this ball?
- From our garden.

51
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,489
Do balls grow in the garden?
Whom does it belong to?

52
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:24,893
The school. Every Sunday
they sprout arms and legs.

53
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,898
- They want to play cricket.
- Don't trouble them.

54
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:33,494
"- Return it. - No, mother"
I 'll take it to Mr. Kailash.

55
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,508
I'll exaggerate and complain.

56
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,273
I'll mak e their life d ifficult.

57
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,246
Don't bother him with
this petty matters.

58
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,244
He's done enough for us.

59
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,280
After your Dad died if he hadn't
helped us with the apple garden...

60
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,786
Who knows where we'd be...

61
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,530
May he live long.

62
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,271
- Good day doctor.
- How are you? - Very well.

63
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,804
- Is Kailash in?
- Yes. Please come in.

64
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,273
How are you?

65
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,311
See for you rself. It gets
worse with the medication.

66
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:22,549
It's 7 years since you' re
"treating me, there's no relief."

67
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,959
Am I a fool to
cure you and fall sick?

68
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,019
I live off wealthy men like you

69
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,565
I 've got a cough since the
evening and an upset tummy.

70
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:47,067
- You ate something wrong.
- Not at all.

71
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:50,081
- You sleep late.
- I sleep early.

72
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,243
You must have started
smoking the cigar again.

73
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,384
I gave it u p ages ago.
I 've forgotten about it.

74
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:01,252
I won't find a since cigar
in this house if I look for it?

75
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,593
Did you see the new Life?
Great article on surgery...

76
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,367
I've read it.

77
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,940
- Something caught in my throat
- I'll take it out.

78
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,622
Was this caught in your throat?
Can't you give up cigars?

79
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,950
How did this get here?
I'll in vestigate right away...

80
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:40,428
No need to ask any one
Ask your own heart.

81
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,634
Wh y can't you give it u p?
Why do you want to kill y ourself?

82
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:49,101
I've explained a 1000 times
cigar is poison for you! Death!

83
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,371
But you won't understand!
Educated but act illiterate!

84
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,105
I 'm so glad you scolded me.

85
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,311
- It won't happen again. Sorry
- You forgive me.

86
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:05,646
Find another doctor. I won't
treat you for you have no control

87
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:10,651
Don't get serious. I'll
give it up if you wish.

88
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,394
There...

89
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,669
- Promise?
- Promise.

90
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,171
Have a cup of tea.

91
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,154
Frightened?

92
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:44,355
I've come to give
not take an ything

93
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,709
Foreign items not local.

94
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,705
Rolex watch from Switzerland

95
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:15,386
Knife from china.

96
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:20,493
I 'd love to be a
lifetime customer.

97
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,130
- But I can't.
- Why?

98
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:28,399
On his death bed my father said...

99
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,477
Become a smuggler but
never buy smuggled goods.

100
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,077
Give me one box of Surf.

101
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,750
What melody is that?

102
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:46,417
I swear the heart is pumping

103
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:51,160
Looks li ke a storm
wrapped in clothes

104
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,766
- You' re teasing me again!
- I 'm not at fault.

105
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,560
Wax always melts before fire.

106
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,603
Wh y do you allow
hoods into your shop?

107
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,780
Please leave for now. It's time
for business. Clients will leave.

108
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,445
I'll erect a wall of the heart

109
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,522
I'll tie her up in a bond of love

110
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,523
Shut up or I'll
yank out your tongue!

111
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:27,197
Okay. I'm not allowed to
speak but can I touch?

112
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,313
By Jove! Who took the
apples from th is tree?

113
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,321
Terrific bowling.
A heap in minutes.

114
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,326
She's coming this way.

115
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,836
Where did these apples
come from? Which orchard?

116
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,633
Don't look around.
I'm asking you.

117
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:15,245
Have you ever seen such apples?
Answer me! Can't you hear?

118
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,849
Are you deaf? Mute?

119
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:23,184
Don't simply gesture.
Speak with your mouth!

120
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,587
Look at the faces.
International crooks!

121
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,863
Band its! Criminals! Brigands!

122
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,225
And you... look like a thief!

123
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,866
You're hungry! Greedy!
No shame eating stolen fruit!

124
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,267
I hope God makes
you deaf and dumb!

125
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,878
Be warned. I'm a handful!

126
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,381
I'll avenge this!
My name is Somna.

127
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:14,295
What has th is poor thing done?
Take him along too.

128
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,969
I'm not so stupid to
allow him into my house.

129
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,974
- But what are you doing?
- Taking revenge.

130
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,715
Taking revenge by stealing?

131
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:38,983
"Yes, by stealing!"

132
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,989
But the room was locked.
How did you get in?

133
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,661
I jumped over the wall
and climbed in the window.

134
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:52,003
If somebody sees you
leaving with stolen booty...?

135
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,337
I don't fear anyone.
My name is Somna.

136
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,690
- The basket is small.
- I'll get a bigger one.

137
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:29,040
Hold it. Turn around.

138
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,442
Give me that arm.

139
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:47,718
I don't fear anyone.
M y name is Somna.

140
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:54,799
That was me... where did
that sound come from?

141
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,069
- From this.
- This...?

142
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,469
Listen...

143
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,809
I jumped over the wall
and climbed in the window.

144
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,476
I sound so sweet!

145
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,812
Does this machine replay voices?

146
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:14,085
"No, it's a machine"
that nabs thieves.

147
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:19,090
I see... how does it work?

148
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,094
The police match the
thief's voice and this one.

149
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,092
And nabs the thief! I got it.

150
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,429
- Now this will go to the police
- Why?

151
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:32,103
- That's how y ou'll be caught.
- Why?

152
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:36,907
- Because you committed theft.
- And the apples you stole?

153
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,512
You have no evidence of that.
While I do.

154
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,878
- Stealing?
- Yes!

155
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,113
Holy smoke!

156
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,918
Your voice has been arrested.

157
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:55,126
- You'll be next.
- Arrested...

158
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:01,464
The police station... court...

159
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,727
Rigorous imprisonment
for 6 months!!

160
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,605
Chains at your feet
handcuff on the wrists.

161
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:13,133
The police will drag you
through the streets to the jail.

162
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,545
And they'll throw you in!

163
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:20,151
Don't do that! I'll lose face!

164
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,155
Here... I'll return your things.

165
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,557
- Take my basket too.
- No point repenting.

166
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,957
- The thief will be punished.
- Please forgive me!

167
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:35,155
"I beg you, please don't"
hand me to the police.

168
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:40,501
Now it's too late...
but I can help you.

169
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,167
- What can be done?
- The same that happens in films

170
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,179
- What?
- When the girl is helpless...

171
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,682
- She sings a song.
- Song...?

172
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:55,186
- I won't sing.
- You won't...?

173
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,593
Listen...

174
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:09,928
- Listen...
- What is it?

175
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:16,202
The song I recall is of love.

176
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,604
And I feel shy in your presence

177
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:24,682
Wh y do y ou feel shy?
You're not singing with joy.

178
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,617
- You're being forced.
- Yes.

179
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,621
- That is true.
- Then begin.

180
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:43,065
I fell for you at first sight

181
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:47,238
No! Girls don't sing
like this in films.

182
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:51,242
- Then how does she sing?
"- She blushes, dances..."

183
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,246
No... I can't do that...

184
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:13,928
I fell for you at first sight

185
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,259
I fell for you at first sight

186
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:24,264
You cast a spell on me

187
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:29,269
I fell for you at first sight

188
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:35,082
You cast a spell on me

189
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:55,704
I thought you were a dream

190
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:59,310
But now I feel I know you

191
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:03,644
I thought you were a dream

192
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:07,318
But now I feel I know you

193
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:11,789
Hold my hand and take me
"wherever you please""

194
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:17,056
It was love at first sight

195
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:43,016
I got conned by your words

196
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:47,119
Your eyes hold me spel I bou nd

197
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:50,855
I got conned by your words

198
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:54,365
Your eyes hold me spell bound

199
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,166
I forgot my self in this love

200
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:38,068
What are you looking for?
Your husband is here.

201
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:41,139
I'm looking for your
"darling daughter, not you."

202
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:43,073
- She's not here either.
- So...?

203
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:47,418
You waste time in medicine
but have no idea of the home.

204
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:50,084
Shobha vanishes the moment
she finds an opportunity.

205
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:54,824
"Tell her clearly, take advantage"
of the situation but not too much

206
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,928
Damm it! You'll always be stupid

207
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,431
I'm referring to Bahadur Singh

208
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:04,426
That general merchant has
cast a spell on Shobha...

209
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,168
she doesn't like bei ng home.

210
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,439
If she gets afflicted with love
no medication will cure her!

211
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,445
- We'll operate then...
- What?

212
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,110
- I mean get them married.
- Marry that tu ppence shopkeeper!

213
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:24,455
My son-in-law has to be a
"m inister, or at least a deputy."

214
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:30,291
Don't trust them.
They vanish in no time.

215
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:34,060
A shop keeper will remain
a shop keeper forever.

216
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:37,866
I won't get taken in by you r
words. I'm off to the junky ard!

217
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:40,471
- Listen...
- Don't butt in.

218
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,463
This is my personal matter.

219
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,479
Damn!!

220
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,306
Don't watch the fun.
Lift me up!

221
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,475
How can I lift you?
It's your personal affair.

222
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:19,909
Exq uisite. Such
a melodious voice

223
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:23,013
Who are you?
Where is Bahadur?

224
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:29,844
'The one selling cure for
"heartache, has passed along"'

225
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,523
I mean he's moved.

226
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,118
- Really?
- Positively.

227
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:41,856
But your slave is here for
you with heart and soul.

228
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,535
What can I offer you?

229
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:49,039
Powder? Lipstick?

230
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:51,940
Cream...?

231
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:57,537
"Sire, please give me"
your gorgeous beard.

232
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:08,055
You' re cruel. You see
with the heart not the eye.

233
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,563
That is why my father
said on his death bed...

234
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:18,302
You can h ide from all but
the cops and the eyes of love

235
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,331
But wh y are y ou i n d isg u ise?

236
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:27,567
- Out of fear of y ou r mother
- How long wi I I y ou be afraid?

237
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,578
As long as she lives.

238
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:33,914
I mean till we get married.

239
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:39,582
How can we be married?
You won't talk to mother.

240
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:43,592
- On ly y ou r name means brave.
- I'll talk to her now!

241
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,589
- I think not...
- Why?

242
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,597
On his death bed my father said...

243
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:55,595
Fall i n love in haste
but marry at leisure.

244
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,268
Or you'll land in trouble.

245
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,008
Has Shobha come here?

246
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:03,614
- Where are you going?
- One slap from your mom...

247
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,609
...will turn me to modern art!

248
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:14,887
- Where is Bahadur Singh?
- He left.

249
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:19,955
Left...? Let me see!

250
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,628
Good grief!

251
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:37,979
Where can he escape? I ' I I
break every bone of h is!

252
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,321
That's a statue.

253
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:56,656
Doesn't matter. Let me
vent my ire on the statue.

254
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:59,670
What a flat nose...

255
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:06,677
- It's made of rubber.
- I s it?

256
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:15,345
But it looks real.
The ear too looks real.

257
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:18,188
Real hair too!

258
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:22,693
- He speaks too.
"- No, it's a statue."

259
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:25,423
He will speak.

260
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:29,700
Mother! We'll pay through
our nose if the leg breaks!

261
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:32,703
How will it break?
It's made of rubber.

262
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,700
"Mother, stop it."

263
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,711
Hit the real Bahadur.

264
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:46,706
Right. Tell the real y ou
to stop chasing m y daughter!

265
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,516
Don't bother. I'll pick them up

266
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,420
One should help fellow beings.

267
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:31,155
You're a good man.
You're also very bad.

268
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:38,764
- Good and bad at the same time?
- Good because you forgive me.

269
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,932
And bad because I got
scolded thanks to you.

270
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:47,574
- Who scolded you?
- Mother. She found out...

271
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,370
I'd come to your room.

272
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:53,776
- Did she see you?
- I told her.

273
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,787
- She scolded me hard.
- Rightfully.

274
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:02,782
She said the man is great
to forgive your grave sin.

275
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:06,189
- I see...
- She also said...

276
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:09,459
"If you see him again,"
I 'd like to meet him.

277
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:13,201
I was afraid but this
turned out to be good news.

278
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,807
- I must leave.
- He y...

279
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:23,809
- Won't you come home?
- Not today. Some other day

280
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,581
- Why? - My going with
you suddenly isn't right.

281
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:34,814
Only if there's g uilt in
your heart but we' re clear

282
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,489
"- Yes, our hearts are pure"
- Then come along.

283
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,228
Okay.

284
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:48,828
We wouldn't have met if your ball
hadn't strayed into the garden.

285
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,842
It's desti n y.

286
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:55,842
Come on i n.

287
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:57,848
Consider th is y ou r own home.

288
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:07,654
Sit down. Be comfortable.

289
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,854
I ' I I get mother.

290
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:15,525
What wou Id y ou I i k e?
Tea or coffee?

291
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,028
- Don't bother.
- That's not possi ble.

292
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,604
One m ust treat g uests wel I.

293
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:24,607
Whatever y ou wish.

294
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:36,618
Wh y d id y ou sh ut the door?
Open the door!

295
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:39,389
"I sa y, open the door!"

296
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:44,559
The door wi I I be opened
i n front of every one.

297
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:48,296
- Wh y?
- To welcome y ou with sticks.

301
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,913
It's the worst si n.

But I d id n't come here
You d ragged me here.

Hogwash! You thoug ht

Th i n k y ou' re very handsome.

You sh ut the wi ndow and

00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:16,766
- Latch it.
- Who comes here?

00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,109
Don't arg ue. Latch it.

00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:35,387

Leave her or I ' I I ki I I y ou.

The confiscated goods...

and the testi mon ies of
Som na and M r. Kai lash prove...

572
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:31,386
Shamsher Si ng h

He is also a sm ugg ler.

Therefore the cou rt sentences

He knows noth i ng. Don't let

"M y honou r, m y I ife..."

01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:56,671
- M other!

Are y ou mad? Do y ou want to

619
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:28,263
Life created from

...wi I I I ive I ife on thorns.

I don't want such a I ife!

You can also get a I ife

So y ou can I ive with

No. M y love I ives i n
every pore of m y bei ng.

627
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:06,297
I won't let another man
come close to me.

628
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,307
You' I I be as chaste
as a tem ple with me.

629
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:16,709
You' I I on ly get refuge
of the name of a h usband.

01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:22,979
Th is sheet wi I I cover y ou r

I probably got a new lease

633
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,364
That one is al ive!

634
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:52,407
- He's i n coma.

- Can't sa y.
- Wi I I he su rvive?

636
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:59,073
There is hope.

Here it is.

645
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:53,866
Fi nd the book doesn't end
y ou r d uty towards the h usband.

646
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:58,467
The fi rst job is to offer

647
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,874
"M ore i m portantly,"

You' re a del icate flower

No storm wi I I come.

These are seasonal wi nds.

But not g ive y ou a ch i Id.

917
01:50:41,935 --> 01:50:44,495
Obviously. Look at Kai lash...

01:50:45,038 --> 01:50:47,097
Got married late but

Don't chal lenge m y man hood.
I can have a crick et team!

921
01:50:57,550 --> 01:50:59,780
"But on h is death bed,"
m y father told me...

922
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:05,120
- M ak e haste i n marriage
- But not i n havi ng kids.

923
01:51:09,963 --> 01:51:11,521
Wi I I I remai n barren al I m y I ife?

924
01:51:12,565 --> 01:51:17,525
"No! M y father also said,"

01:51:18,571 --> 01:51:20,266
don't care about m y wi I I.

Th is seems to be an u n I ucky da y.

But I won't g ive u p toda y.

930
01:52:21,968 --> 01:52:24,994
I warned y ou not to
rush i nto an y one's bed room.

931
01:52:25,905 --> 01:52:28,373
"It's not a stranger's,"
but m y own da ug hter's room.

932
01:52:28,975 --> 01:52:31,944
- There's no shame there.
- You have no sense.

933
01:52:32,645 --> 01:52:36,411
- Draw the cu rtai n.
- An nou nce the good news.

934
01:52:37,050 --> 01:52:39,883
"I ' m y ou r mother-i n-law,"

01:52:40,653 --> 01:52:45,113
"Son, get read y and"
see the son's face.

936
01:52:46,659 --> 01:52:48,627
How come I don't
know I 've had a son?

937
01:52:51,664 --> 01:52:55,122
You haven't but y ou wi I I and
y ou have to bear some d iscomfort.

938
01:52:56,669 --> 01:53:00,628
"For th is desi re, I ' m wi I I i ng"
to clash with a mou ntai n!

939
01:53:01,007 --> 01:53:04,443
You don't have to clash
but cl i m b u p a mou ntai n.

940
01:53:06,679 --> 01:53:12,311
The sage who g rants the boon of
ferti I ity is on ch i nch i nacho h i I I

941
01:53:13,286 --> 01:53:15,652
On top of the mou ntai n?

Can't he cl i m b down h i I I?

943
01:53:22,695 --> 01:53:24,663
No wa y! The river
doesn't go to the th i rsty.

944
01:53:27,700 --> 01:53:29,930
Then tak e Shobha.
She' I I have the ch i Id.

945
01:53:30,703 --> 01:53:34,662
- The sage won't look at g i rls

946
01:53:43,716 --> 01:53:46,685
"You ng man, march on"

You r job isn't to I ive

952
01:54:13,913 --> 01:54:16,711
How can I advance?

I fear the tal I mou ntai n
"and the deep val le y s""

02:14:47,979 --> 02:14:50,345
Th is is the truth.
You' re the fak e father.

1114
02:14:50,582 --> 02:14:53,346
I ' m related b y blood
You can't stop it.

1115
02:14:53,985 --> 02:14:56,453
Don't tak e h i m awa y.
He's the lam p of m y I ife.

1116
02:14:56,988 --> 02:15:00,424
- But the I ig ht is m i ne.
- I have very few breaths.

1117
02:15:00,659 --> 02:15:02,388
I have a whole I ife to lead.

1118
02:15:04,996 --> 02:15:06,964
Step awa y. You
have no rig ht over h i m.

1119
02:15:14,005 --> 02:15:18,635
"Al I rig ht, I won't clai m"
an y rig ht. He is y ou r son.

1120
02:15:19,511 --> 02:15:22,969
But I raised h i m. I
n u rtu red h i m with m y blood.

1121
02:15:24,015 --> 02:15:25,482
M y beats are i n h is heart

1122
02:15:25,684 --> 02:15:27,982
Don't steal m y sou I.

1123
02:15:28,420 --> 02:15:29,717
I can't leave h i m.

1124
02:15:32,023 --> 02:15:34,992
I beg y ou. Have merc y.

1125

G ive h i m to me.
I I ive on ly for h i m.

1126
02:15:41,032 --> 02:15:44,001
He's the on ly sig n of I ife
i n m y desolate existence

1127
02:15:44,536 --> 02:15:47,334
I ' I I be destro y ed!

1128
02:15:47,706 --> 02:15:49,003
Leave m y leg!

1129
02:16:17,068 --> 02:16:18,797
I m ust tal k to Som na rig ht awa y.

1130
02:16:19,337 --> 02:16:21,669
But she's gone to the hospital
- What?

1131
02:16:23,074 --> 02:16:26,043
M ust have been a terri ble
n ig htmare to break i nto sweat

1132
02:16:27,078 --> 02:16:28,705
Doesn't matter.
M i I k wi I I do y ou good.

1133
02:16:30,081 --> 02:16:35,041
"M y son! N u rse, how is Bobb y?"

1134
02:16:35,420 --> 02:16:37,047
He's fi ne. He's sleepi ng.

1135
02:16:39,758 --> 02:16:41,055
I was looki ng for y ou.

1136
02:16:42,093 --> 02:16:44,459
Whose son is Bobb y?
M i ne or M r. Kai lash's?

1137
02:16:46,097 --> 02:16:49,498
Swear b y Bobb y.
You r hand is on h is head.

1138
02:16:51,102 --> 02:16:52,569
Sa y he's not m y son.

1139
02:16:53,638 --> 02:16:55,071
Now there's no dou bt

1140
02:16:56,107 --> 02:16:58,075
I am con vi nced he's m y son.

1141
02:16:59,110 --> 02:17:02,807
"And if he's m y son,"
I can't sta y awa y from h i m.

1142
02:17:03,515 --> 02:17:06,075
- I ' I I tak e h i m awa y.
- No.

1143
02:17:06,451 --> 02:17:09,682
You can't tak e h i m awa y.
Bobb y isn't y ou r ch i Id.

1144
02:17:10,121 --> 02:17:13,090
He's not even m y ch i Id.
Bobb y is Kai lash's son.

1145
02:17:13,792 --> 02:17:15,760
He's al ive on ly beca use of h i m.

1146
02:17:16,127 --> 02:17:20,086
He wou Id n't exist if
Kai lash had n't g iven me refuge.

1147
02:17:22,133 --> 02:17:25,500
He accepted the ug ly
not pretty face I had.

1148
02:17:26,471 --> 02:17:31,101
He appl ied verm i I ion to m y
lowered head to g ive it honou r

1149
02:17:32,811 --> 02:17:37,544
He gave Bobb y love
not merely h is name.

1150
02:17:38,149 --> 02:17:42,108
He showered h is da y s and n ig hts
"on h i m, gave h i m h is very sou I!"

1151
02:17:44,155 --> 02:17:46,885
Bobb y is what he is toda y
on ly beca use of h i m.

1152
02:17:48,159 --> 02:17:51,560
"He wal ks on Bobb y's feet,"
sees th roug h h is e y es...

1153
02:17:53,164 --> 02:17:57,897
You want to tak e h is e y es
and push h i m i nto darkness!

1154
02:17:59,170 --> 02:18:00,865
"For God's sak e, don't."

1155
02:18:01,439 --> 02:18:05,398
Forget h i m. H is breath
is tied to Bobb y.

1156
02:18:06,778 --> 02:18:09,406
He wi I I lose h is I ife.

1157
02:18:10,849 --> 02:18:14,615
I plead with y ou for
the I ife of that angel.

02:18:16,187 --> 02:18:19,156
Don't sa y another word. Here...

1159
02:18:21,593 --> 02:18:24,824
Bobb y belongs to M r. Kai lash
and he' I I alwa y s be h is.

1160
02:18:26,197 --> 02:18:28,165
I ' I I go awa y from h is world.

1161
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:30,633

It's ti me to com plete the

1166
02:19:17,248 --> 02:19:21,207
"As for me, I ' m the protector"

1167
02:19:22,253 --> 02:19:26,883
Not the owner. I ' m the
"path, not the desti nation."

1168
02:19:32,263 --> 02:19:35,630
Al I the jo y s that

I want to bu nd le them u p

Don't sa y th is to me!

"M r. Kai lash, y ou r son..."

1188
02:21:43,394 --> 02:21:49,355
Blessed is the man who
