1
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:28,109
<i>We want justice! We want justice!</i>

2
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:30,596
<i>Public anger is on the rise</i>

3
00:01:30,702 --> 00:01:32,308
<i>following the brutal rape</i>

4
00:01:32,428 --> 00:01:34,261
<i>of a medical student on 16th December.</i>

5
00:01:36,807 --> 00:01:40,798
<i>People across ages have taken to the</i>
<i>streets of the capital city</i>

6
00:01:40,918 --> 00:01:43,960
<i>demanding the strictest punishment</i>

7
00:01:44,126 --> 00:01:47,842
<i>to the perpetrators arrested</i>
<i>by the Delhi Police.</i>

8
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:52,266
From my heart to your heart,
Raging through me and you

9
00:01:52,558 --> 00:01:55,874
No matter who ignites it,
This fire must be kept alive!

10
00:01:55,974 --> 00:01:58,391
<i>It's probably the first time</i>
<i>that Delhi has seen</i>

11
00:01:58,433 --> 00:02:00,766
<i>such an emotionally charged</i>
<i>public protest.</i>

12
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:04,933
<i>The crowds are undeterred by the</i>
<i>presence of security forces.</i>

13
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:09,433
<i>Their rage and resolve</i>
<i>continues to grow.</i>

14
00:02:10,724 --> 00:02:12,016
We want justice, hang them!

15
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,641
Beat us a hundred times, we'll still
turn up in thousands and not turn back.

16
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:16,112
We want justice!

17
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:23,891
We want justice, hang them!

18
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:13,203
No... Don't touch it, Uncle!
It's expensive!

19
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:17,169
Please understand, Uncle.

20
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,516
Alka...

21
00:03:24,141 --> 00:03:26,775
I'm sorry Sir, we can't
cover you right now.

22
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:30,433
- Please step aside.
- Come this way, Uncle.

23
00:03:31,724 --> 00:03:32,839
Amol Dwivedi?

24
00:03:35,183 --> 00:03:35,833
Yes.

25
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,565
Amol, we were at the editing
workshop together.

26
00:03:38,724 --> 00:03:39,849
In the journalism course.

27
00:03:41,724 --> 00:03:44,141
Right. How are you?

28
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,391
I've been following your campaign...
You're doing great work.

29
00:03:48,994 --> 00:03:51,327
Well, acid attacks don't
get noticed like rape does.

30
00:03:52,641 --> 00:03:53,808
But Uncle just doesn't get it!

31
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:58,854
Malti's Petition has brought a lot
of attention to acid attacks, right?

32
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,516
Where is Malti? Is she here?

33
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:03,516
Why so negative, Amol?

34
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:05,308
Everything begins with
the first step, right?

35
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,029
I'll track down Malti.

36
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:10,601
Stick around, results will follow.

37
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:12,266
Let's go.

38
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:17,077
Sticking around will get us killed.
We must leave now. Come.

39
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:19,183
Cynical as always?

40
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:20,785
Come, let's go!

41
00:04:30,808 --> 00:04:32,433
Make sure you buy tickets.

42
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:37,232
How many of us?

43
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:38,480
- Eleven.
- Eleven.

44
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:46,391
All routes must be diverted today?

45
00:04:47,308 --> 00:04:49,689
Yes, there's a blockade all the way
from Red Fort to India Gate.

46
00:04:49,808 --> 00:04:53,308
They had it coming.
This government should fall.

47
00:04:54,308 --> 00:04:56,474
It just might if the girl dies...

48
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,808
Why punish the ones who are alive?

49
00:05:14,683 --> 00:05:18,808
Madam, I can barely recall the
salesgirl from last month...

50
00:05:19,016 --> 00:05:20,808
You're asking me about 8 years ago!

51
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:23,683
That salesgirl was attacked
with acid, Uncle...

52
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:25,432
Right outside the market.

53
00:05:25,683 --> 00:05:26,959
Her name was Malti.

54
00:05:27,183 --> 00:05:28,766
How can you say you don't remember?

55
00:05:29,058 --> 00:05:30,854
I'm sure you have some contact of hers.

56
00:05:30,891 --> 00:05:32,141
Check your records please!

57
00:05:32,224 --> 00:05:34,641
They lived in the servant quarters
of Bungalow number 35.

58
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,744
Manohar Lal passed away
about 4-5 months ago.

59
00:05:37,974 --> 00:05:39,558
They moved away after that.

60
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:43,788
I already told you over the phone,
she doesn't want to speak to the media.

61
00:05:43,864 --> 00:05:45,156
They have been through enough already.

62
00:05:45,183 --> 00:05:47,558
Ma'am believe me, I'm
an ethical journalist.

63
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:49,016
I won't misuse her contact.

64
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,516
Shyamlal!

65
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:52,811
Ma'am, after the Nirbhaya case

66
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:55,849
it's become even more crucial
to bring Malti's story to people.

67
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,202
You have a steady hand.

68
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:04,183
With 5-10 days practice, you'll be set.

69
00:06:05,474 --> 00:06:06,683
Can you do manicures?

70
00:06:09,777 --> 00:06:10,536
Yes.

71
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:13,891
It's so tough to win clients'
confidence these days.

72
00:06:14,683 --> 00:06:16,058
There's so much competition!

73
00:06:16,391 --> 00:06:21,141
This girl who worked for me opened
her own parlour last month. Imagine!

74
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:24,161
<i>The problem is, Malti...</i>

75
00:06:25,058 --> 00:06:28,625
<i>People expect beauty</i>
<i>at a beauty parlour.</i>

76
00:06:28,683 --> 00:06:29,933
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

77
00:06:36,224 --> 00:06:40,349
Why did you quit studies
after high school?

78
00:06:41,558 --> 00:06:42,308
Thank you.

79
00:06:42,898 --> 00:06:45,565
- Sir, can I get you something?
- No, not now.

80
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:54,536
You didn't mention in the application

81
00:06:54,974 --> 00:06:57,598
about your... you know...

82
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:00,474
There's no category
for Acid survivors, Sir.

83
00:07:01,402 --> 00:07:03,444
Had there been, I would
have mentioned it.

84
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:08,869
Have you tried applying
for jobs at restaurants?

85
00:07:09,474 --> 00:07:12,141
They have vacancies
for disabled people now!

86
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:39,849
- Good morning ma'am.
- Two <i>aloo tikki</i> burgers please.

87
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:48,661
They've taken Rohit for a test again.

88
00:07:50,141 --> 00:07:52,460
The doctor says I need
to get checked for TB too.

89
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:54,933
If not me, at least
listen to the doctor.

90
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:58,391
If you stay here day and night,
you're bound to fall ill.

91
00:08:01,808 --> 00:08:03,724
Papa would have never
allowed Rohit to stay here.

92
00:08:05,308 --> 00:08:06,641
It's not that bad.

93
00:08:07,183 --> 00:08:09,474
If your father was around, we
wouldn't even have managed this.

94
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:12,433
- He'd drink away all our money.
- Don't start now, Mummy.

95
00:08:18,202 --> 00:08:18,994
Shiraz Aunty!

96
00:08:19,308 --> 00:08:21,141
Why don't you call back, Malti?

97
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:25,016
I was going to, Shiraz Aunty.

98
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:26,929
I've come to the hospital with food.

99
00:08:27,058 --> 00:08:30,266
I told you we should shift
Rohit to a better hospital.

100
00:08:30,391 --> 00:08:32,558
You've already done
so much, Shiraz Aunty.

101
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:35,349
This hospital isn't all that bad.

102
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,433
I know how bad it is.

103
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:39,266
Okay, listen...

104
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:44,183
There is this journalist,
Alka.

105
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:45,766
<i>She wants to meet you.</i>

106
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:47,891
<i>She's been after me for weeks.</i>

107
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:49,141
Will you meet her?

108
00:08:50,641 --> 00:08:51,308
Brother...

109
00:08:52,058 --> 00:08:54,141
Shiraz Aunty, I'll call you back.

110
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:05,661
Here, I'll do it.

111
00:09:06,558 --> 00:09:08,016
This doesn't hurt anymore.

112
00:09:13,974 --> 00:09:16,558
The Justice Verma Committee
submitted its report last month.

113
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,433
It takes a hard look at
violence against women.

114
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:25,183
Do you feel it will draw attention
to the issue of acid attacks?

115
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,891
It would be great if it does.

116
00:09:30,891 --> 00:09:34,205
The Verma Committee proposes
a separate section of law

117
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,435
for acid attacks.

118
00:09:35,922 --> 00:09:37,756
And for punishment to be increased.

119
00:09:38,516 --> 00:09:40,084
Isn't this a big victory?

120
00:09:42,145 --> 00:09:44,145
It would be, <i>if</i> the law is passed.

121
00:09:48,494 --> 00:09:50,577
Alka ma'am, can I get
a job at your office?

122
00:09:52,683 --> 00:09:54,016
I can work on computers.

123
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:59,349
Work as a receptionist,
attend calls, answer emails...

124
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:01,599
Yeah sure...

125
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:03,099
I'll go to the office and find out.

126
00:10:03,641 --> 00:10:04,391
Okay.

127
00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:07,525
So, Malti...

128
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:12,391
Your Petition demands a ban
on the sale of acid.

129
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:15,630
You took this important step...

130
00:10:15,724 --> 00:10:19,766
And it's been 7 years since.
Nothing has moved.

131
00:10:21,474 --> 00:10:22,867
Acid is still sold freely.

132
00:10:25,822 --> 00:10:28,572
Can we stop now?
I have a job interview.

133
00:10:29,683 --> 00:10:31,099
- Sure.
- Thank you.

134
00:10:35,272 --> 00:10:37,480
Have you heard of
'Stop Acid Violence'?

135
00:10:38,308 --> 00:10:39,225
No.

136
00:10:40,058 --> 00:10:41,850
There's this man called Amol Dwivedi.

137
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,683
- You should meet him.
- Will he give me a job?

138
00:10:46,183 --> 00:10:49,224
Not sure about a job...
but a lecture, definitely!

139
00:10:59,766 --> 00:11:03,933
Alka said you run an NGO.
Can I get a job there?

140
00:11:04,952 --> 00:11:05,744
Who Alka?

141
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:08,391
She's a reporter with AajTak.

142
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:10,224
- <i>Your friend...</i>
- Right.

143
00:11:12,224 --> 00:11:13,141
What kind of work can you do?

144
00:11:14,338 --> 00:11:15,296
Office work.

145
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:18,641
Will you be able to
manage an NGO's work?

146
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:19,636
Yes.

147
00:11:20,224 --> 00:11:23,058
Look, we work to help Acid Survivors

148
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,433
<i>and this kind of work
requires a certain ethos.</i>

149
00:11:26,474 --> 00:11:28,974
Only a sensitive person
can handle this job.

150
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:30,433
Believe me, some people get alarmed

151
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:32,683
just looking at their faces.

152
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:33,891
Actually...

153
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:36,028
And the salary won't be much either.

154
00:11:36,891 --> 00:11:39,141
You'd be better off
working at a call center!

155
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:42,266
- Mr. Amol, can you hear me out...
- What do you do currently, by the way?

156
00:11:44,808 --> 00:11:45,558
Hello?

157
00:11:46,724 --> 00:11:49,474
Nothing. I have to go
to court off and on...

158
00:11:49,974 --> 00:11:51,331
So I had to quit my job.

159
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:52,517
Court? Why?

160
00:11:54,516 --> 00:11:55,891
There's an old Petition of mine.

161
00:11:56,224 --> 00:11:57,330
What Petition?

162
00:12:00,349 --> 00:12:01,315
To ban Acid.

163
00:12:04,146 --> 00:12:05,563
Petition... Malti?

164
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:07,933
Yes.

165
00:12:09,391 --> 00:12:10,641
I'm so sorry!

166
00:12:12,141 --> 00:12:13,766
Please come.
Let's meet in the office.

167
00:12:24,349 --> 00:12:28,349
From providing moral support
to making them self-reliant

168
00:12:28,808 --> 00:12:31,797
our organization Chhaaya
supports acid-attack victims

169
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:33,141
in every way possible.

170
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:39,933
Yes... This campaign needs support.

171
00:12:40,683 --> 00:12:41,474
It needs funds.

172
00:12:42,724 --> 00:12:44,141
It needs good people like you.

173
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:49,453
Our Vice-president Manish Kumar
will explain the entire process to you.

174
00:12:51,724 --> 00:12:54,849
Yes, it's all fully transparent.

175
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:58,076
All details are available online.
You don't worry at all.

176
00:13:12,016 --> 00:13:14,349
Okay... job done!

177
00:13:18,474 --> 00:13:19,616
Is there no interview?

178
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:22,139
Consider it done.

179
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:24,739
You tell us when you can join.

180
00:13:26,717 --> 00:13:27,634
Today?

181
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,720
You can put today's date
on the joining letter.

182
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:36,463
I'm applying for a personal loan.

183
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:38,338
I'll need it for documentation.

184
00:13:40,434 --> 00:13:41,546
Joining letter.

185
00:13:55,512 --> 00:13:56,637
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

186
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,327
Thank you.

187
00:14:13,734 --> 00:14:15,193
You took us on quite a ride!

188
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,292
We've been looking
for you for a while.

189
00:14:19,724 --> 00:14:21,058
Chhaaya needs you.

190
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:24,066
What would my salary be?

191
00:14:27,354 --> 00:14:31,149
Look, consider yourself a founder...

192
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:33,578
not an employee.

193
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:38,734
You've come to the right place.
Now just dive right in!

194
00:14:45,391 --> 00:14:46,138
Shall we?

195
00:14:47,183 --> 00:14:48,016
Yes.

196
00:14:48,994 --> 00:14:50,494
They're back from the hospital.

197
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:52,266
They found accommodation close-by.

198
00:14:53,461 --> 00:14:57,711
Thank God... they can't make her
travel in this grueling heat.

199
00:14:59,992 --> 00:15:01,784
Yes, we've fixed a call-time of 4 pm.

200
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:04,604
One camera unit is enough, right?

201
00:15:05,085 --> 00:15:06,780
Okay, listen...

202
00:15:07,836 --> 00:15:10,554
Make the arrangements for the
lightings and also the batteries.

203
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:17,408
No, no...

204
00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:24,966
It should be proper...

205
00:15:40,914 --> 00:15:41,830
Enough.

206
00:15:42,728 --> 00:15:43,997
Just a little more.

207
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,083
There're only two morsels left.

208
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:04,387
Chhaaya has managed
to collect 25000 rupees.

209
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,440
We'll deposit the advance at
the hospital tomorrow morning.

210
00:16:10,698 --> 00:16:13,239
The operation won't be
delayed. Don't worry.

211
00:16:18,872 --> 00:16:19,914
Ready?

212
00:16:26,228 --> 00:16:27,686
Her exams were round the corner.

213
00:16:29,207 --> 00:16:32,582
She left for her math tuition at 4 am.

214
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:35,385
She must have barely reached the turn

215
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:38,522
when we heard her scream.

216
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,913
She came running, covering her face...

217
00:16:44,763 --> 00:16:48,887
"Baba! Someone threw hot water on me!"

218
00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:54,707
Her skin was blue and blistering.

219
00:16:56,465 --> 00:17:00,340
We instantly realized...
this wasn't hot water.

220
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:06,601
But why did he do this?

221
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:10,338
He was her classmate.

222
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:13,349
He'd try to mingle with her.

223
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:16,148
She didn't pay any attention to him.

224
00:17:18,601 --> 00:17:21,893
God knows what went through his mind.

225
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:28,058
He just splashed her with
acid... To punish her!

226
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,183
"A smile defaced
wiped out of sight"

227
00:17:43,224 --> 00:17:46,282
"In the sprinkle of a spark"

228
00:17:47,075 --> 00:17:50,466
"In a splash, all erased..."

229
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,303
"The face fades
like a fallen pawn"

230
00:18:01,423 --> 00:18:04,923
"Like light smothered by the dark"

231
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:11,224
"In a splash, all erased..."

232
00:18:15,943 --> 00:18:22,444
"Neither love, nor longing"

233
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:27,126
"No promises to be kept"

234
00:18:28,603 --> 00:18:32,491
"Neither love, nor longing
no promises to be kept"

235
00:18:32,715 --> 00:18:35,937
"A handful of darkness
the eyes are intent"

236
00:18:35,974 --> 00:18:39,558
"A smile defaced
wiped out of sight"

237
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,016
"In the sprinkle of a spark"

238
00:18:43,433 --> 00:18:46,891
"In a splash, all erased..."

239
00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:52,123
"The face fades
like a fallen pawn"

240
00:18:52,224 --> 00:18:55,599
"Like light smothered by the dark"

241
00:18:56,189 --> 00:19:01,814
"In a splash, all erased..."

242
00:19:28,724 --> 00:19:33,683
"A meaningless fetish"

243
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:39,470
"Raging smoke without fire"

244
00:19:41,385 --> 00:19:45,175
"A meaningless fetish
raging smoke without fire"

245
00:19:45,295 --> 00:19:48,628
"The mind is delirious
the thoughts are dire"

246
00:19:48,724 --> 00:19:52,266
"A smile defaced
wiped out of sight"

247
00:19:52,345 --> 00:19:55,678
"In the sprinkle of a spark"

248
00:19:57,987 --> 00:20:01,070
"In a splash, all erased..."

249
00:20:05,058 --> 00:20:08,141
"All is scorched..."

250
00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:13,484
"Everything is erased..."

251
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:18,970
What happened, dear?

252
00:20:19,974 --> 00:20:21,058
How did this happen?

253
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:23,220
Please keep your distance.
She is prone to infection.

254
00:20:23,774 --> 00:20:25,595
- Tell me, child...
- Sir, please.

255
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:34,973
Ask her who threw the acid.

256
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:36,929
Please, you have to stop this.
Look at her!

257
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,356
She is not ready for any statement.
Please make him understand.

258
00:20:40,887 --> 00:20:41,553
Bike...

259
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:42,720
Bike!

260
00:20:45,887 --> 00:20:47,470
Blue... stole...

261
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,391
Whose phone is this,
beeping non-stop?

262
00:20:56,264 --> 00:20:57,222
Malti's.

263
00:20:57,685 --> 00:20:58,393
Hand it over.

264
00:20:59,137 --> 00:21:00,303
We'll need it for the investigation.

265
00:21:03,737 --> 00:21:06,070
Bike and a blue stole...

266
00:21:31,781 --> 00:21:32,989
Whoever did this...

267
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:36,336
We won't spare him.

268
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:38,963
Sister, eat something.

269
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:42,969
Just a bit.

270
00:21:52,054 --> 00:21:55,887
I've been working as a cook for
Shiraz Ma'am for about 5 years now.

271
00:21:56,558 --> 00:21:58,641
We live in the servant
quarters of her bungalow.

272
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,669
Age?

273
00:22:00,058 --> 00:22:01,054
45.

274
00:22:01,745 --> 00:22:02,543
Malti's age.

275
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:03,693
19.

276
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:06,724
She's in Class 12, at
the Rajakiya School.

277
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,146
With Rajesh?

278
00:22:11,688 --> 00:22:12,938
It's a girls' school, Sir.

279
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:14,608
If she's in a girls' school

280
00:22:14,683 --> 00:22:17,058
why is her phone full of
messages from boys?

281
00:22:19,048 --> 00:22:27,215
Akash. Rajesh. Dilip. Prashant.
Pankaj. Vijay. Sanket.

282
00:22:28,551 --> 00:22:31,115
Her phone is full of boys.

283
00:22:32,844 --> 00:22:34,594
How is that relevant to the case?

284
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,013
This is Archana Bajaj. Our lawyer.

285
00:22:41,214 --> 00:22:43,672
Let us <i>have</i> a case first, madam...

286
00:22:44,135 --> 00:22:46,218
Right now we're looking
for a needle in a haystack.

287
00:23:01,945 --> 00:23:04,570
Leave him! Where are you taking him!

288
00:23:07,078 --> 00:23:09,655
Come on, scoundrel...

289
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:12,178
Leave him, sir!

290
00:23:18,656 --> 00:23:21,156
Come on!

291
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,678
- Leave him, sir!
- Get lost.

292
00:23:36,887 --> 00:23:37,767
- Grab him.
- What happened, sir?

293
00:23:37,878 --> 00:23:39,170
Mummy! Sir I didn't do anything!

294
00:23:39,304 --> 00:23:40,679
Listen to me! Mummy!

295
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,846
What's happened? Where are you
taking him? Leave him!

296
00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:44,012
What has he done?

297
00:23:45,845 --> 00:23:46,762
Blue stole...

298
00:23:47,095 --> 00:23:48,054
Take Mummy along as well.

299
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:52,261
- Sir, listen to me. Sir!
- Please leave us.

300
00:23:53,304 --> 00:23:54,637
How old are you?

301
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:57,008
18.

302
00:23:57,891 --> 00:24:00,183
18, and already done Mummy proud?

303
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,945
I haven't done anything.

304
00:24:02,256 --> 00:24:03,672
Are you Malti's boyfriend?

305
00:24:06,995 --> 00:24:10,120
Ask your questions. Just don't
strain the patient too much.

306
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:14,928
Bring her in.

307
00:24:21,882 --> 00:24:23,132
Was it this blue stole?

308
00:24:27,695 --> 00:24:28,695
Bring her closer.

309
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,120
Sure?

310
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,882
I'm Rajesh's mother, dear!

311
00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:48,825
He hasn't done anything.
Please tell them!

312
00:24:48,914 --> 00:24:50,039
Alright, enough.

313
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,210
Okay then... We'll keep looking.

314
00:25:11,413 --> 00:25:12,371
Is he your relative?

315
00:25:12,534 --> 00:25:14,700
No. But he's like family.

316
00:25:15,011 --> 00:25:16,261
Works in the neighbourhood.

317
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,710
Is that so?

318
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:19,357
Yes.

319
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,896
But how did you become friends?

320
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,729
You're in a boys' school, and
Malti's in a girls' school.

321
00:25:29,053 --> 00:25:33,386
My friend's girlfriend is her friend.

322
00:25:35,018 --> 00:25:36,601
Ripened too soon, haven't we?

323
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,470
Sir, I haven't done anything!

324
00:25:39,511 --> 00:25:40,552
Then who has?

325
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:50,387
Babbu.

326
00:25:57,242 --> 00:25:59,159
- Full name?
- Bashir Khan.

327
00:25:59,554 --> 00:26:01,429
- Age?
- 25.

328
00:26:02,784 --> 00:26:04,691
According to my school records.

329
00:26:05,095 --> 00:26:06,178
I'm actually 30.

330
00:26:06,224 --> 00:26:07,974
And do you know how old Malti is?

331
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:11,896
What do you do?

332
00:26:12,315 --> 00:26:13,273
Tailoring.

333
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,860
I work in a boutique, at Golf Lawns.

334
00:26:16,302 --> 00:26:17,302
Tailor?

335
00:26:22,601 --> 00:26:26,139
Sorry, I read your private messages.

336
00:26:27,974 --> 00:26:30,558
"A word with you
is my only respite..."

337
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:34,433
"In thousands there is
but one night..."

338
00:26:35,474 --> 00:26:38,391
"When you lift your gaze
to meet my eyes..."

339
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,886
"In that one moment,
I own the skies!"

340
00:26:47,183 --> 00:26:49,974
You're a poet in the guise of a tailor.

341
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:51,929
She's a friend of mine.

342
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:53,720
We've been friends for 2 years.

343
00:26:53,887 --> 00:26:56,262
We're like family.
I look out for Malti...

344
00:26:56,474 --> 00:26:58,099
I want to protect her
from bad things.

345
00:26:58,224 --> 00:26:59,849
Babbu knew about us.

346
00:26:59,945 --> 00:27:02,278
Rajesh didn't like my
closeness to Malti's family.

347
00:27:03,097 --> 00:27:04,139
That's why he's trying
to frame me.

348
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:05,519
Where were you at the
time of the attack?

349
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:06,435
At school.

350
00:27:06,849 --> 00:27:07,849
In Ghaziabad.

351
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:12,955
The cell tower at Humayun Road shows
that on the 22nd at 10.30 AM

352
00:27:13,889 --> 00:27:16,555
Babbu's phone was at Mayur Market.

353
00:27:28,308 --> 00:27:29,308
Babbu...

354
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,262
On a bike...

355
00:27:36,683 --> 00:27:40,319
Blue stole...

356
00:27:46,718 --> 00:27:51,801
Threw acid from a glass...

357
00:27:56,262 --> 00:27:57,845
Parveen threw it.

358
00:27:58,558 --> 00:27:59,391
Parveen?

359
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,558
Imitiaz's wife.

360
00:28:06,648 --> 00:28:07,648
Who's Imtiaz?

361
00:28:14,147 --> 00:28:17,438
Babbu's... brother.

362
00:28:44,929 --> 00:28:46,304
Where are you taking him, sir?

363
00:29:17,524 --> 00:29:18,482
Well done!

364
00:29:30,057 --> 00:29:32,098
When did you last see Parveen Shaikh?

365
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:33,585
Haven't seen her for about 10 days.

366
00:29:35,128 --> 00:29:37,878
We were out of town. We just got
back yesterday from Saharanpur.

367
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:40,523
Her house has been
locked for 3-4 days.

368
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,263
How could you not tell?

369
00:29:47,843 --> 00:29:50,176
He visited your home regularly,
hung out with all of you...

370
00:29:50,926 --> 00:29:51,843
Ma'am...

371
00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:56,399
Shiraz Ma'am, Malti was fine there...

372
00:29:56,632 --> 00:29:57,923
She would have died there.

373
00:29:58,426 --> 00:30:00,834
You're spending so much
money for us...

374
00:30:00,937 --> 00:30:04,354
If she doesn't get proper treatment now,
her whole life will be ruined.

375
00:30:05,718 --> 00:30:08,384
Now don't do all this. Go to her.

376
00:30:10,115 --> 00:30:10,990
Archana!

377
00:30:13,116 --> 00:30:14,324
He has confessed.

378
00:30:14,906 --> 00:30:16,822
It was Babbu and Parveen on the bike.

379
00:30:18,653 --> 00:30:19,487
Water.

380
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:05,299
I haven't done anything.

381
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:28,220
Here it is.

382
00:31:31,343 --> 00:31:34,218
First, we'll work on the eyes...
around the eyelids.

383
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:37,139
Then we'll reconstruct the mouth

384
00:31:37,816 --> 00:31:39,524
and release the skin around the lips.

385
00:31:40,518 --> 00:31:41,976
Then we'll get to nose reconstruction.

386
00:31:44,004 --> 00:31:45,212
What kind of nose would you like, Malti?

387
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:46,672
Long or sharp?

388
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:48,389
You better tell us now.

389
00:31:48,724 --> 00:31:50,224
Don't complain later
that we flattened it!

390
00:31:55,172 --> 00:31:56,088
Mrs. Agarwal...

391
00:32:02,781 --> 00:32:05,858
It's important that Malti see
only her new face now...

392
00:32:06,131 --> 00:32:07,256
After the surgery.

393
00:33:12,933 --> 00:33:15,933
- Hey, catch!
- He's unable to play on the left side.

394
00:33:16,648 --> 00:33:20,481
No issues, the next ball,
focus on the left side.

395
00:33:21,489 --> 00:33:23,470
Go... get money from home.

396
00:33:24,526 --> 00:33:25,442
Get lost!

397
00:33:26,058 --> 00:33:27,683
Baby boy's afraid to go home.

398
00:33:28,505 --> 00:33:30,887
After all, there's a monster in there!

399
00:33:31,942 --> 00:33:32,983
Why bring my family into this?

400
00:33:33,099 --> 00:33:34,974
How dare you talk about my sister!

401
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:41,304
Listen... leave him... leave him!

402
00:33:41,929 --> 00:33:43,887
Leave him... leave him!

403
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:45,606
Leave him!

404
00:33:48,224 --> 00:33:49,766
Go leave your sister at a circus!

405
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:52,530
Let's go.

406
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:54,992
Let's go.

407
00:34:03,427 --> 00:34:04,427
Ma...

408
00:34:16,664 --> 00:34:17,678
Ma!

409
00:35:04,867 --> 00:35:05,825
<i>Malti!</i>

410
00:36:29,102 --> 00:36:30,352
Open your eyes, child...

411
00:36:38,204 --> 00:36:39,163
Now shut them.

412
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:44,495
Now blink.

413
00:37:48,305 --> 00:37:49,851
Are you going to put everything away?

414
00:37:49,891 --> 00:37:50,766
Ma...

415
00:37:52,491 --> 00:37:54,283
I have no nose... no ears...

416
00:37:56,112 --> 00:37:57,487
How do I wear the earrings?

417
00:38:04,128 --> 00:38:05,378
Throw this radio away too!

418
00:38:17,487 --> 00:38:19,153
Has the correspondence course started?

419
00:38:19,437 --> 00:38:20,604
No.

420
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,280
It begins next month.

421
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:26,177
But she doesn't seem
too interested in studying.

422
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:29,315
Call her here.

423
00:38:36,934 --> 00:38:37,934
Come, get up...

424
00:38:38,227 --> 00:38:39,727
Shiraz Aunty is calling you.

425
00:38:41,192 --> 00:38:42,692
Archana Madam's here too.

426
00:38:45,153 --> 00:38:46,278
Come on.

427
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:02,094
Hi Malti.

428
00:39:11,828 --> 00:39:15,286
We were thinking...
Let's give up on the case.

429
00:39:17,536 --> 00:39:20,536
Because Babbu's won anyway, right?

430
00:39:25,724 --> 00:39:27,016
He's out on bail.

431
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,635
There's a wedding in his family.

432
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,150
His life hasn't come to a standstill.

433
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:37,744
And look at us...

434
00:39:40,051 --> 00:39:43,760
Lying in bed, hiding in defeat.

435
00:39:44,953 --> 00:39:46,536
This is exactly what he wanted!

436
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,266
Now even if we do send him to jail,
what's the point?

437
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:56,978
You've lost even before
beginning the case.

438
00:40:15,502 --> 00:40:16,635
Will you come out now?

439
00:40:18,695 --> 00:40:19,653
Do you want to fight?

440
00:40:40,465 --> 00:40:44,174
<i>Completing your education</i>
<i>will give you confidence.</i>

441
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:47,401
Your chances of getting
a job will increase.

442
00:40:47,702 --> 00:40:48,618
Now tell me...

443
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:51,269
Who all are going to
complete their studies?

444
00:40:52,974 --> 00:40:53,974
Great!

445
00:40:55,507 --> 00:41:01,674
"The dawn, once grey and pale
now awash with a gleaming ray"

446
00:41:06,183 --> 00:41:11,016
"The dawn, once grey and pale
now awash with a gleaming ray"

447
00:41:11,279 --> 00:41:16,613
"The breath, stifled in knots
now beginning to exhale..."

448
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:19,707
"Beginning to exhale..."

449
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:29,541
"Once frozen in an icy dark
now softening in the warmth of day"

450
00:41:29,776 --> 00:41:34,943
"The breath, stifled in knots
now beginning to exhale..."

451
00:41:35,184 --> 00:41:38,101
"Beginning to exhale..."

452
00:42:10,792 --> 00:42:12,375
Papa, I don't want to go
for counseling.

453
00:42:13,226 --> 00:42:13,934
Why, dear?

454
00:42:15,058 --> 00:42:15,891
What happened?

455
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,855
I want to learn stitching
from Sharma Aunty.

456
00:42:26,518 --> 00:42:27,518
All right.

457
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:34,959
Have your drink.

458
00:42:36,192 --> 00:42:37,526
I won't tell Mummy.

459
00:42:44,691 --> 00:42:49,733
"Light will find a way
to arrive and stay"

460
00:42:49,974 --> 00:42:54,808
"To vanquish the dark
and paint a new day"

461
00:42:55,433 --> 00:43:01,516
"Eyes stripped of dreams
now have hope in their gaze"

462
00:43:03,004 --> 00:43:08,275
"The breath, stifled in knots
now beginning to exhale..."

463
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:11,421
"Beginning to exhale..."

464
00:43:19,335 --> 00:43:21,168
<i>You do realize you're</i>
<i>overreacting, right?</i>

465
00:43:21,617 --> 00:43:24,702
Suhasini Iyer is considered one of the
better judges of the Sessions Court.

466
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:29,728
- You've done it all wrong!
- Alright, sit! I'll redo it.

467
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:34,930
Is the height of both braids fine now?

468
00:43:36,461 --> 00:43:39,169
Has she ever interpreted the law
outside of set precedence?

469
00:43:39,341 --> 00:43:41,341
But that shouldn't affect us.

470
00:43:42,455 --> 00:43:45,580
Archana, we will win this case.
The evidence is in our favour.

471
00:43:51,526 --> 00:43:55,734
- I know. You've messed it up again!
- Okay, I'll do it again.

472
00:43:55,854 --> 00:43:57,923
No, you just don't know how to!

473
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:01,835
- I keep telling you.
- Tea for the ladies!

474
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:04,049
Should I do your braids?

475
00:44:04,697 --> 00:44:05,405
Okay, come.

476
00:44:05,933 --> 00:44:06,766
Let's see!

477
00:44:08,496 --> 00:44:09,613
How should I make it?

478
00:44:11,005 --> 00:44:11,958
Thank God!

479
00:44:14,274 --> 00:44:16,357
Thank God, there is evidence.

480
00:44:17,014 --> 00:44:19,431
But that will only establish the crime,
not the punishment.

481
00:44:19,802 --> 00:44:20,594
Why?

482
00:44:21,815 --> 00:44:22,732
Well...

483
00:44:24,629 --> 00:44:26,421
If I throw this hot tea on you

484
00:44:26,695 --> 00:44:29,112
it would be a crime under
the IPC Section 326.

485
00:44:29,453 --> 00:44:29,983
Right.

486
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,437
And if I throw acid on you instead,
it's still Section 326!

487
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:34,306
Got it?

488
00:44:36,351 --> 00:44:37,804
Whether it's hot tea or acid

489
00:44:37,918 --> 00:44:40,720
the sentence for causing
'Grevious Injury' is only 2-7 years.

490
00:44:40,768 --> 00:44:43,070
That's the maximum punishment
you get in that Section.

491
00:44:44,376 --> 00:44:47,334
So Babbu would get a maximum
sentence of 7 years.

492
00:44:48,673 --> 00:44:52,673
And within that, he'll surely spend
4 years going in and out on bail.

493
00:44:53,634 --> 00:44:56,676
For good conduct, he could get
6 months to a year shaved off.

494
00:44:57,806 --> 00:45:02,556
So in effect, he'll probably serve
about 2 years in prison.

495
00:45:04,653 --> 00:45:06,028
So not even 7...

496
00:45:07,058 --> 00:45:12,808
The punishment for destroying
someone's entire life is just 2 years.

497
00:45:24,332 --> 00:45:25,057
Hello...

498
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,683
Hello Malti, how are you?

499
00:45:27,127 --> 00:45:28,168
I'm okay, sister.

500
00:45:28,915 --> 00:45:31,123
What's happened?
Is your phone not working?

501
00:45:33,521 --> 00:45:35,586
Your first hearing is right here.

502
00:45:38,784 --> 00:45:39,825
I know.

503
00:45:40,755 --> 00:45:42,130
<i>Okay, let's go over this again.</i>

504
00:45:42,585 --> 00:45:46,709
<i>The Defense Lawyer will say that</i>
<i>you never saw Babbu's face...</i>

505
00:45:46,907 --> 00:45:47,865
I did.

506
00:45:49,144 --> 00:45:52,769
<i>He'll say - 'Then why didn't you name</i>
<i>him in your initial statement?'</i>

507
00:45:53,593 --> 00:45:56,873
I did. No one understood...

508
00:45:58,125 --> 00:46:02,208
<i>What if the Defense says that Rajesh</i>
<i>threw the acid. What will you say?</i>

509
00:46:04,634 --> 00:46:05,615
<i>Malti?</i>

510
00:46:12,496 --> 00:46:14,204
Rajesh is my boyfriend.

511
00:46:16,638 --> 00:46:17,555
He was...

512
00:46:19,074 --> 00:46:20,532
Why would he do such a thing?

513
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,425
We were just friends.

514
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,968
But according to the police, you gave a
statement saying Malti is your girlfriend.

515
00:46:29,855 --> 00:46:31,021
I never said that.

516
00:46:34,722 --> 00:46:35,931
Your Honour, please note.

517
00:46:36,027 --> 00:46:38,672
Your Honour, the witness is recanting
from his earlier statement.

518
00:46:43,004 --> 00:46:44,296
You know Malti, don't you?

519
00:46:45,334 --> 00:46:48,542
Yes. We used to go to school together.

520
00:46:49,003 --> 00:46:50,836
She studied at the girls' school nearby.

521
00:46:51,221 --> 00:46:53,387
And do you recognize this man?

522
00:46:59,873 --> 00:47:00,623
No.

523
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,212
He's not going to break.

524
00:47:10,602 --> 00:47:13,477
But the police say you gave
a statement saying

525
00:47:13,707 --> 00:47:16,874
that my client Bashir Khan
threw acid on Malti?

526
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:18,001
Look carefully...

527
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:19,828
I gave no such statement.

528
00:47:22,266 --> 00:47:24,003
Your Honour, no more questions.

529
00:47:25,713 --> 00:47:28,130
Your Honour, I would like to present
the logs of the search conducted

530
00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:31,766
at Ms. Shaikh's home, from
the police case diary.

531
00:47:37,266 --> 00:47:40,224
I don't know how this stole
came into my house.

532
00:47:40,913 --> 00:47:44,330
The police probably planted it in
my trunk. I wasn't home, you see!

533
00:47:44,505 --> 00:47:45,963
But tell me, Ms. Shaikh...

534
00:47:46,409 --> 00:47:48,909
if you didn't do anything,
why were you absconding?

535
00:47:49,141 --> 00:47:50,433
I... I got scared.

536
00:47:50,516 --> 00:47:54,141
Your Honour, if Ms. Shaikh is innocent,
she should have nothing to fear.

537
00:47:54,422 --> 00:47:55,672
Objection, Your Honour.

538
00:47:55,971 --> 00:47:58,805
One cannot establish someone as guilty
on the basis of their emotional state.

539
00:47:59,121 --> 00:48:01,954
She has falsely accused Babbu!

540
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,494
I thought she might get me framed too.

541
00:48:06,942 --> 00:48:09,692
Then why does her stole
have acid burns on it?

542
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:12,753
Hey, can't you hear?
That stole doesn't belong to me!

543
00:48:15,552 --> 00:48:18,677
What about her hands, Your Honour?
They belong to her, right?

544
00:48:20,635 --> 00:48:24,356
These are pictures of Parveen's hands,
about four weeks after the attack.

545
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:34,798
They're oil burns. From long ago...
Got them while frying food.

546
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,235
Your Honour, the Forensics
report clearly states

547
00:48:38,308 --> 00:48:42,183
that the scars were caused by
a corrosive substance.

548
00:48:42,845 --> 00:48:44,929
Hot oil isn't a corrosive
substance, Your Honour.

549
00:48:44,978 --> 00:48:47,853
But the report doesn't specifically say
that they're acid burns either.

550
00:48:48,088 --> 00:48:49,593
Your Honour, the facts are
being twisted!

551
00:48:49,643 --> 00:48:52,226
The forensic report clearly
states that the burns

552
00:48:52,299 --> 00:48:55,008
were caused by a strong
corrosive substance

553
00:48:55,058 --> 00:48:57,058
such as HCl - Hydrochloric Acid,

554
00:48:57,328 --> 00:49:01,578
HNO3 - Nitric Acid or
H2SO4 - Sulphuric Acid.

555
00:49:01,678 --> 00:49:02,845
What did you use?

556
00:49:02,947 --> 00:49:05,113
- Objection, Your Honour.
- Objection sustained.

557
00:49:05,445 --> 00:49:07,570
- Miss Bajaj, please?
- Sorry, Your Honour.

558
00:49:07,827 --> 00:49:12,660
Your Honour, the report also confirms
that these burns are recent, not old.

559
00:49:16,479 --> 00:49:19,520
We'll discuss this point further,
at the next hearing.

560
00:49:20,301 --> 00:49:21,384
Your Honour.

561
00:49:21,753 --> 00:49:23,836
Don't worry. I'll make a
request for bail.

562
00:49:26,903 --> 00:49:29,695
My client needs to attend to
an important family matter...

563
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:31,141
He's been in jail for 3 months.

564
00:49:31,683 --> 00:49:33,516
- He is asking for bail.
- I understand.

565
00:49:35,551 --> 00:49:38,068
Your Honour, please reject
this bail request.

566
00:49:38,474 --> 00:49:40,895
The accused is fighting
a charge of acid throwing.

567
00:49:40,984 --> 00:49:42,609
It could have taken my client's life.

568
00:49:42,822 --> 00:49:45,447
He is facing 307 - Attempt to Murder.

569
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:47,526
Your client is sitting right here!

570
00:49:48,811 --> 00:49:50,216
Your Honour, how is 307 valid?

571
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:52,823
Please, Your Honour.

572
00:49:54,795 --> 00:49:57,586
Can you provide a surety
of 100000 rupees?

573
00:49:58,085 --> 00:49:58,918
Yes, Your Honour.

574
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:02,585
Okay, let me take it under consideration.

575
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:23,858
Should I burn it?

576
00:50:26,299 --> 00:50:27,215
How are you, Rohit?

577
00:50:27,718 --> 00:50:28,593
Mummy!

578
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:31,135
Your brother Babbu's getting married.

579
00:50:31,969 --> 00:50:32,969
Do come.

580
00:50:33,401 --> 00:50:35,234
He remembers you a lot.

581
00:50:40,109 --> 00:50:42,526
He'll rot in hell, the scoundrel!

582
00:50:44,361 --> 00:50:47,144
What is he trying to prove,
getting married?

583
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:48,962
Enough now...

584
00:50:49,343 --> 00:50:51,289
He's only got bail. He hasn't
been acquitted.

585
00:50:52,141 --> 00:50:53,710
He'll be back in jail soon enough.

586
00:50:55,061 --> 00:50:56,061
Right, Archana Madam?

587
00:50:59,027 --> 00:51:00,364
This is the second time he's got bail.

588
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:02,333
Now until the verdict is out,

589
00:51:02,737 --> 00:51:05,445
it won't be easy to send him back to jail.

590
00:51:23,683 --> 00:51:26,308
It would be so good if
Acid stopped being sold.

591
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,260
If you didn't have it,
you wouldn't throw it.

592
00:51:49,735 --> 00:51:53,441
I agree that merely banning the sale
of acid won't curb the crime.

593
00:51:53,552 --> 00:51:57,289
Hence, the first plea in Malti's Petition

594
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:59,541
is an amendment in the IPC.

595
00:52:00,023 --> 00:52:06,107
Ms Bajaj, acid attacks are
undoubtedly a heinous crime.

596
00:52:07,078 --> 00:52:10,286
But what you're asking for... how will
you achieve this on the ground?

597
00:52:11,672 --> 00:52:15,593
I don't know how practical
a blanket ban is.

598
00:52:15,738 --> 00:52:19,613
Your Lordship, if we can ban the
sale of eggs in Rishikesh...

599
00:52:19,974 --> 00:52:22,599
Why can't we ban the sale of acid
in the country?

600
00:52:24,081 --> 00:52:26,874
Your Lordship, it's very easy
to throw acid...

601
00:52:27,064 --> 00:52:29,480
And just as difficult to
get the attacker punished.

602
00:52:30,893 --> 00:52:33,476
Because Section 326 - Grievous injury

603
00:52:34,308 --> 00:52:38,016
doesn't take cognizance
of this crime's severity.

604
00:52:38,141 --> 00:52:39,641
These sections are outdated.

605
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:43,806
I urge this court to amend
the appropriate sections

606
00:52:44,112 --> 00:52:46,112
according to the intensity of the crime.

607
00:52:52,513 --> 00:52:53,471
Fair enough.

608
00:52:54,995 --> 00:52:58,495
But we cannot take this decision
without the Government's approval.

609
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:02,635
Which we all know is not the
easiest task in the world.

610
00:53:04,034 --> 00:53:06,492
This bench admits this plea.

611
00:53:07,055 --> 00:53:09,138
Let's revisit this plea
in three months' time.

612
00:53:09,526 --> 00:53:13,359
And let's include the Solicitor General
at the next hearing.

613
00:53:14,766 --> 00:53:15,683
Good!

614
00:53:16,391 --> 00:53:18,644
Whenever we talk about
violence on women

615
00:53:18,683 --> 00:53:21,807
why do we instantly ask
for a change in laws?

616
00:53:22,058 --> 00:53:25,493
We all know that just changing laws
won't change people's mindsets.

617
00:53:25,724 --> 00:53:28,307
Will banning knives stop murders?

618
00:53:28,961 --> 00:53:29,878
You're right.

619
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:32,343
Which is why, along with amending the law,

620
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:35,784
we are also asking for a ban on the
unchecked sale of acid. Next.

621
00:53:35,968 --> 00:53:37,968
But can this really be enforced?

622
00:53:38,099 --> 00:53:41,016
Can a household item like this
be banned instantly?

623
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:45,426
Industrial use makes sense.
Why do you need acid at home?

624
00:53:45,871 --> 00:53:47,543
How do you clean your toilets?

625
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:53,331
Yes, asking for a complete ban on
acid is ambitious, but also important.

626
00:53:53,862 --> 00:53:55,404
- Next.
- Ms Malti...

627
00:53:55,872 --> 00:53:56,681
Malti.

628
00:53:56,808 --> 00:53:59,886
It's being said that your attacker
knew you for many years.

629
00:54:00,339 --> 00:54:05,130
He even wanted to marry you,
and you met him often too.

630
00:54:06,128 --> 00:54:10,704
We were family friends.
We all knew him.

631
00:54:10,935 --> 00:54:13,352
If he was a family friend,
known to you...

632
00:54:13,461 --> 00:54:17,003
Why would he suddenly attack
you with acid, for no reason?

633
00:54:17,059 --> 00:54:18,934
What does that mean?
Is it her fault?

634
00:54:19,575 --> 00:54:25,117
Ms Malti, your boyfriend Rajesh has
claimed that you were just friends.

635
00:54:25,336 --> 00:54:28,294
Is that true?

636
00:54:29,995 --> 00:54:34,786
I... I haven't spoken to Rajesh...

637
00:54:35,718 --> 00:54:38,218
Malti, can you show us your face...

638
00:54:38,291 --> 00:54:40,999
So that the public can see
the severity of the attack?

639
00:54:42,683 --> 00:54:46,590
What plans of marriage? I mean,
have you thought of settling down?

640
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:47,853
What kind of questions are these?

641
00:54:47,891 --> 00:54:49,724
How can you be so insensitive!

642
00:54:56,573 --> 00:54:58,235
<i>How many more surgeries?</i>

643
00:54:59,152 --> 00:55:01,110
<i>Depends. Five to seven.</i>

644
00:55:02,801 --> 00:55:03,843
Does it frighten you?

645
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,426
Not as much as Court.

646
00:55:08,803 --> 00:55:10,428
Actually this surgery is special.

647
00:55:11,854 --> 00:55:14,687
We'll take skin from your back
and graft it on your face.

648
00:55:15,101 --> 00:55:16,687
So the skin looks even.

649
00:55:17,351 --> 00:55:20,893
From here to here, we'll use
a single piece of skin.

650
00:55:21,295 --> 00:55:23,081
One even skin, all over.

651
00:55:23,352 --> 00:55:24,977
This should really improve your face.

652
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:28,551
Doctor, can you fix my ear this time?

653
00:55:31,007 --> 00:55:33,715
This surgery is a little specialized, dear.

654
00:55:34,327 --> 00:55:35,718
We'll work on the ear
the next time?

655
00:55:37,558 --> 00:55:40,280
You wait outside, Malti...
I'll just come.

656
00:55:48,141 --> 00:55:51,128
- Is this going to be complicated?
- It is a complicated procedure.

657
00:55:51,692 --> 00:55:53,776
The surgery will be completed
in 10 days and 3 stages.

658
00:55:54,636 --> 00:55:56,927
<i>Malti will be in the ICU for 5 days.</i>

659
00:55:57,784 --> 00:56:00,075
<i>And she will be on a ventilator.</i>

660
00:56:01,953 --> 00:56:04,495
<i>It is complicated,</i>
<i>but it will be worth it.</i>

661
00:56:16,491 --> 00:56:18,199
I'll serve Shiraz Ma'am
mangoes and come.

662
00:56:18,925 --> 00:56:20,771
You're serving her the same
mangoes that she gave us?

663
00:56:22,522 --> 00:56:23,647
You could have bought some sweets?

664
00:56:28,974 --> 00:56:30,641
She passed somehow!

665
00:56:30,961 --> 00:56:34,586
Thank God! They might not
have given her a fourth chance!

666
00:56:37,351 --> 00:56:38,684
Now... College?

667
00:56:38,901 --> 00:56:41,317
High School is enough for us.

668
00:56:43,183 --> 00:56:44,141
I want money.

669
00:56:45,176 --> 00:56:46,718
I don't have any. Go home.

670
00:56:47,176 --> 00:56:48,301
Everything is for Malti...

671
00:56:49,217 --> 00:56:50,008
Right?

672
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:54,266
Go home. There's a box in the cupboard.

673
00:56:54,871 --> 00:56:56,371
You'll find 100 rupees in it.

674
00:57:23,193 --> 00:57:25,818
How did you not realize that
your son is so unwell?

675
00:57:28,258 --> 00:57:30,549
Intestinal TB. Second stage.

676
00:57:41,308 --> 00:57:43,766
Meenakshi has come from
Archana Ma'am's office.

677
00:57:44,253 --> 00:57:46,878
- I need to go sign some papers.
- What papers?

678
00:57:48,145 --> 00:57:49,186
For the case.

679
00:57:49,343 --> 00:57:50,676
Which case is this now?

680
00:57:51,141 --> 00:57:52,391
Don't start off, Mummy.

681
00:57:52,433 --> 00:57:54,641
Don't we have enough troubles already?

682
00:57:55,526 --> 00:57:56,984
Your brother's sick,
Dad's an alcoholic...

683
00:57:57,426 --> 00:57:58,635
And you want to save the nation!

684
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,909
Do you want to run around
courts all your life?

685
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:03,396
Only the privileged
can afford to do this.

686
00:58:08,417 --> 00:58:09,549
You're leaving now?

687
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:11,423
It will be dark by the time you return...

688
00:58:11,664 --> 00:58:12,372
So?

689
00:58:15,703 --> 00:58:17,536
What worse can happen now?

690
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:28,730
She's angry, right?
Let her be. She's worried.

691
00:58:29,538 --> 00:58:31,121
You focus on your work.

692
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,760
After four years, we have finally got
a hearing at the Sessions Court.

693
00:58:39,269 --> 00:58:40,894
Barely two weeks are left...

694
00:58:41,516 --> 00:58:43,308
Archana Ma'am, I want
to ask you something.

695
00:58:43,487 --> 00:58:44,573
Yes...

696
00:58:46,226 --> 00:58:48,117
This case it'll be over now, right?

697
00:58:48,968 --> 00:58:50,051
Why, what's happened?

698
00:58:50,933 --> 00:58:52,308
Actually, Mummy's right.

699
00:58:54,849 --> 00:58:58,433
These legal battles, the media...
I don't think I can do this.

700
00:59:01,558 --> 00:59:04,641
Okay... then who will?

701
00:59:06,058 --> 00:59:09,808
I mean, there are so many
problems at home...

702
00:59:09,891 --> 00:59:13,849
Malti... Do you know why Babbu
has been granted bail again?

703
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:18,014
He is going to have a child.

704
00:59:20,407 --> 00:59:22,740
After the Sessions Court,
it will be the High Court.

705
00:59:23,221 --> 00:59:24,637
After that, the Supreme Court.

706
00:59:25,625 --> 00:59:27,473
There's a long way ahead.

707
00:59:28,384 --> 00:59:29,717
Get used to the noise.

708
00:59:33,709 --> 00:59:36,935
"Happy birthday to you!"

709
00:59:37,193 --> 00:59:40,959
"Happy birthday dear Rhea!"

710
00:59:41,248 --> 00:59:44,224
"Happy birthday to you!"

711
00:59:56,085 --> 00:59:57,793
We will have a lot of fun without you!

712
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,280
I hate you.

713
01:00:06,022 --> 01:00:06,939
- Bye.
- Bye.

714
01:00:18,339 --> 01:00:19,505
I don't get it, you know.

715
01:00:20,712 --> 01:00:23,962
Why was Malti tolerating him?
She should've just slapped him!

716
01:00:24,585 --> 01:00:28,793
If she had slapped him and then
Bashir Khan had thrown acid on her,

717
01:00:29,012 --> 01:00:31,887
you would've said Malti shouldn't
have aggravated him.

718
01:00:35,197 --> 01:00:37,447
Broken beer bottle with acid stains.

719
01:00:39,695 --> 01:00:42,778
For the beer bottle, the Defense will
surely say it was planted by the police.

720
01:00:43,101 --> 01:00:46,601
In such cases, always keep
supporting evidence ready. Okay.

721
01:00:46,766 --> 01:00:47,974
Babbu's confession...

722
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:52,094
Which the Defense claims, was
extracted via third degree treatment.

723
01:00:52,393 --> 01:00:55,143
Then comes, Malti's statement.

724
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:59,090
And why is Malti's statement
so important to this case?

725
01:00:59,501 --> 01:01:00,792
Not you. Sukesh?

726
01:01:00,894 --> 01:01:02,935
Ma'am, because in this case the
victim herself is an eyewitness?

727
01:01:03,151 --> 01:01:05,859
Hence the court will give maximum
weightage to the victim's testimony.

728
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:06,955
Very good!

729
01:01:07,183 --> 01:01:12,183
And finally, our trump card...
Babbu's cellphone record.

730
01:01:12,457 --> 01:01:13,582
At the time of the attack

731
01:01:13,683 --> 01:01:17,516
the accused's phone was at the
crime spot. At Mayur Market.

732
01:01:17,832 --> 01:01:19,998
Again. Evidence will
establish the crime.

733
01:01:20,336 --> 01:01:21,919
We need to focus on the sentence.

734
01:01:22,343 --> 01:01:27,301
Not 326, we must constantly
underline Section 307.

735
01:01:29,279 --> 01:01:30,404
307.

736
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:37,078
In light of the evidence presented,
this Court pronounces

737
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:46,044
Bashir Khan aka Babbu guilty
under IPC Sections 307 and 120B.

738
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:52,710
For being an accomplice to a horrific crime
like an Acid attack,

739
01:01:52,829 --> 01:02:00,662
the Court also pronounces Parveen Shaikh
guilty under IPC Sections 307 and 120B.

740
01:02:01,072 --> 01:02:07,530
The Court sentences Bashir Khan to
10 years of rigorous imprisonment

741
01:02:07,943 --> 01:02:10,359
and a fine of 75000 rupees.

742
01:02:10,753 --> 01:02:14,253
And Parveen Shaikh to 7 years
of rigorous imprisonment

743
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,731
and a fine of 50000 rupees.

744
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:22,810
Your Honour, you know 10 years
is not enough...

745
01:02:23,084 --> 01:02:25,454
Ms Bajaj, I thought you'd be happy.

746
01:02:25,772 --> 01:02:28,772
10 years for an Acid attack
is unprecedented.

747
01:02:28,909 --> 01:02:32,247
Pardon me, Your Honour but this
case was so severe that...

748
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:36,412
Your Honour, my client Bashir Khan
would like to appeal for leniency.

749
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:40,211
He is also ready to give the complainant
100000 rupees as compensation.

750
01:02:41,265 --> 01:02:43,140
And... We'll meet in High Court,
Miss Bajaj.

751
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:47,425
<i>This judgement is historic...</i>

752
01:02:48,058 --> 01:02:51,009
For the first time in
an Acid attack case,

753
01:02:51,229 --> 01:02:54,895
a Sessions Court has given
a 10-year prison sentence.

754
01:02:55,728 --> 01:02:56,644
Now we hope

755
01:02:56,933 --> 01:02:59,100
that our Petition comes up
for hearing soon

756
01:02:59,224 --> 01:03:00,391
and the laws are amended as well.

757
01:03:00,474 --> 01:03:05,183
Ms Malti, Bashir Khan offered you
100000 rupees as compensation.

758
01:03:05,301 --> 01:03:06,483
Why did you refuse it?

759
01:03:11,083 --> 01:03:13,458
Accepting his money would
mean forgiving him.

760
01:03:17,373 --> 01:03:18,998
He scarred my face...

761
01:03:21,026 --> 01:03:22,151
Not my spirit.

762
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:29,842
"The dawn, once grey and pale
now awash with a gleaming ray"

763
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:35,274
"The breath, stifled in knots
now beginning to exhale..."

764
01:03:35,641 --> 01:03:38,086
"Beginning to exhale..."

765
01:03:40,474 --> 01:03:45,641
"Open up... And begin..."

766
01:03:46,135 --> 01:03:50,510
"A new sky is unfolding within..."

767
01:03:51,058 --> 01:03:55,808
"Open up... And begin..."

768
01:03:56,058 --> 01:03:59,821
"A new sky is unfolding within..."

769
01:04:00,112 --> 01:04:01,528
Look, it's simple.

770
01:04:01,996 --> 01:04:04,413
There's a whole universe out there
beyond social media.

771
01:04:04,634 --> 01:04:06,787
We want to mobilize the youth...
Let's go to Delhi University.

772
01:04:07,016 --> 01:04:08,516
Gargi, Miranda House...

773
01:04:08,682 --> 01:04:10,891
Let's go to girls' colleges and talk
directly to the young women.

774
01:04:11,266 --> 01:04:14,697
We could also perform street plays
to stir up the people.

775
01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:17,243
This isn't enough.
We need more money.

776
01:04:17,829 --> 01:04:20,204
Look, we can't spend more than
twenty thousand on any campaign.

777
01:04:20,474 --> 01:04:21,474
Amol has put a cap on the spends.

778
01:04:24,974 --> 01:04:28,922
Amol Sir. You need to crouch lower.
I can still see your ears.

779
01:04:29,042 --> 01:04:31,375
Hmm... Did you say something?

780
01:04:32,474 --> 01:04:33,506
The same old story again!

781
01:04:34,599 --> 01:04:37,724
If we advertise poorly, our
communication won't be strong.

782
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:38,932
So be it.

783
01:04:39,516 --> 01:04:40,849
Those who want to contribute,

784
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:44,212
will do so because of our intention;
not the fancy designs of our campaign.

785
01:04:45,344 --> 01:04:47,410
And the focus should be on the
cause... right Manish?

786
01:04:47,913 --> 01:04:49,455
No... I mean, Malti has a point too.

787
01:04:50,141 --> 01:04:52,349
Our communication needs to
keep up with the times.

788
01:04:53,307 --> 01:04:56,516
And, to bring in funders,
our messaging must be crisp.

789
01:04:56,557 --> 01:04:59,474
Look, this money is first and foremost
for the Acid Survivors.

790
01:05:00,349 --> 01:05:02,766
We can get donations by posting
on social media too.

791
01:05:07,724 --> 01:05:08,913
Manish, send me Suresh Paswan's
bank details...

792
01:05:08,974 --> 01:05:10,683
- I need more funds!
- You won't get more!

793
01:05:10,849 --> 01:05:12,849
Campaign with the resources
we have, or let it be!

794
01:05:26,557 --> 01:05:28,974
We've collected 60000 rupees
for Chitra and Suman.

795
01:05:30,182 --> 01:05:31,724
Both the sisters are admitted
in hospital.

796
01:05:32,474 --> 01:05:34,122
We've organized accommodation
for their family too.

797
01:05:34,474 --> 01:05:36,016
The operation must happen
as soon as possible.

798
01:05:36,974 --> 01:05:39,932
We need to go to the hospital
and pressurize the authorities.

799
01:05:42,141 --> 01:05:44,141
We need some sensible volunteers...

800
01:05:46,038 --> 01:05:48,330
A team of four must be present
at the hospital in advance.

801
01:05:50,724 --> 01:05:54,849
Malti, your phone has a camera,
right? You can record on it.

802
01:05:55,307 --> 01:05:56,891
Sorry Deepa, I'm going home.

803
01:06:15,516 --> 01:06:18,937
Hello Mummy... I'll be late today.

804
01:06:19,932 --> 01:06:20,766
Again?

805
01:06:22,307 --> 01:06:25,275
<i>Aren't your hassles in court enough?</i>
<i>Now this too!</i>

806
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:29,557
Mummy, two sisters were attacked. They've
come all the way from Patna to Delhi.

807
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:30,820
Got your salary?

808
01:06:32,266 --> 01:06:33,099
It'll come.

809
01:06:38,141 --> 01:06:41,266
Sister, we need to shift
them to the burn ward.

810
01:06:43,266 --> 01:06:45,724
Ma'am, you're not even wearing gloves!

811
01:06:47,891 --> 01:06:49,557
- I'll be back.
- Sis... Sister!

812
01:06:55,557 --> 01:06:57,016
They belonged to an upper-caste.

813
01:06:58,682 --> 01:06:59,641
All four...

814
01:07:01,266 --> 01:07:02,516
They would taunt us

815
01:07:03,974 --> 01:07:09,891
and say, 'Low-caste folk
can't be software engineers'.

816
01:07:13,432 --> 01:07:16,099
They were sexually harassing us, sir...

817
01:07:18,609 --> 01:07:22,567
At night, they climbed onto
the roof of our house.

818
01:07:23,996 --> 01:07:27,663
It was a thatch roof,
so it gave way easily.

819
01:07:28,788 --> 01:07:30,455
They had brought Acid with them...

820
01:07:30,766 --> 01:07:32,266
They threw it on both of us...

821
01:07:36,391 --> 01:07:40,004
"The face fades
like a fallen pawn"

822
01:07:40,062 --> 01:07:43,312
"Like light smothered by the dark"

823
01:07:43,932 --> 01:07:46,766
"In a splash, all erased..."

824
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,666
Gently!

825
01:07:53,724 --> 01:07:56,349
"A smile defaced
wiped out of sight"

826
01:07:56,432 --> 01:07:59,724
"In the sprinkle of a spark"

827
01:08:00,254 --> 01:08:05,837
"In a splash, all erased..."

828
01:08:06,224 --> 01:08:09,182
We reached Patna hospital somehow...

829
01:08:10,539 --> 01:08:12,831
And the guard shooed us away.

830
01:08:15,932 --> 01:08:19,141
He said, "This hospital isn't
for low-caste people like you."

831
01:08:21,391 --> 01:08:27,224
Had they admitted me...
my face could have been saved!

832
01:08:27,724 --> 01:08:30,903
"A handful of darkness
the eyes are intent"

833
01:08:30,974 --> 01:08:34,474
"A smile defaced
wiped out of sight"

834
01:08:34,557 --> 01:08:38,016
"In the sprinkle of a spark"

835
01:08:38,432 --> 01:08:42,182
"In a splash, all erased..."

836
01:08:43,682 --> 01:08:46,599
"Everything was erased..."

837
01:08:48,141 --> 01:08:51,708
"Such monsters should be killed."

838
01:08:52,266 --> 01:08:56,974
"Stop Acid Violence - Chhaaya,
you guys are doing a great job."

839
01:08:58,182 --> 01:09:02,307
"Congratulations to Chitra and
Suman for successful surgery."

840
01:09:02,474 --> 01:09:05,266
Wow! Show me...
How many likes did it get?

841
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:07,289
Over a thousand.

842
01:09:08,349 --> 01:09:09,759
Oh my God!

843
01:09:10,682 --> 01:09:16,099
"How can one human being do this
to another human being?"

844
01:09:16,432 --> 01:09:19,656
"This is bar... baric."

845
01:09:19,996 --> 01:09:20,912
Barbaric.

846
01:09:20,974 --> 01:09:22,771
Barbaric means?

847
01:09:23,424 --> 01:09:25,841
Hmm... Very bad, I guess.

848
01:09:27,766 --> 01:09:30,641
"These girls look like freaks."

849
01:09:31,141 --> 01:09:34,432
"Their lives are completely ruined."

850
01:09:45,557 --> 01:09:46,293
Malti?

851
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:50,466
Your face looks so good.
I want mine to be like that too.

852
01:09:50,641 --> 01:09:53,641
We'll get surgery done for you.
Gradually, it will improve.

853
01:09:56,432 --> 01:09:57,691
How many surgeries
have you had?

854
01:09:59,349 --> 01:10:00,859
- Seven.
- Seven!

855
01:10:02,266 --> 01:10:05,516
How? I'm still struggling to manage
money for my second.

856
01:10:05,641 --> 01:10:08,391
You'll get 300000 from the
Victim compensation scheme...

857
01:10:08,932 --> 01:10:14,099
Oh yes! This time I'll get a face
exactly like Alia Bhatt!

858
01:10:17,954 --> 01:10:19,537
But when will the money come?

859
01:10:20,266 --> 01:10:23,720
I had asked Amol Sir.
He snapped at me, and how!

860
01:10:24,266 --> 01:10:26,849
"Get lost! Going on about
the compensation scheme!"

861
01:10:27,099 --> 01:10:29,057
"Am I the government?
How would I know?"

862
01:10:29,724 --> 01:10:30,807
You're mad!

863
01:10:34,871 --> 01:10:36,871
Only you get away with
saying anything to him.

864
01:10:37,391 --> 01:10:38,766
Aren't you afraid of him?

865
01:10:39,454 --> 01:10:41,370
Why should I be...
Is he the government?

866
01:10:59,913 --> 01:11:02,621
The neighbours called. They're asking
us to reduce the volume.

867
01:11:22,682 --> 01:11:23,682
No alcohol?

868
01:11:25,746 --> 01:11:26,538
No?

869
01:11:27,746 --> 01:11:28,663
That's all that is missing!

870
01:11:29,182 --> 01:11:30,182
Amol Sir, where were you?

871
01:11:31,895 --> 01:11:33,520
Everyone's been trying to call you.

872
01:11:35,724 --> 01:11:38,057
326 A and B!

873
01:11:41,165 --> 01:11:42,040
Cut the cake!

874
01:11:44,432 --> 01:11:48,723
Tell me something, Ms Malti.
What's 326 A and B?

875
01:11:48,847 --> 01:11:49,764
What do they mean?

876
01:11:53,557 --> 01:11:54,981
Amol Sir, why are you doing this?

877
01:11:55,141 --> 01:11:58,891
No, please explain to us why
we're celebrating 326's birthday.

878
01:12:07,224 --> 01:12:10,766
Amol Sir, the IPC has been amended.

879
01:12:13,099 --> 01:12:15,516
Acid attacks now have a
separate section under law.

880
01:12:16,266 --> 01:12:22,141
Isn't that what you...
what all of us wanted?

881
01:12:22,307 --> 01:12:25,516
Oh... So, the penal code has been
amended and that's enough?

882
01:12:26,682 --> 01:12:30,807
The attacker will get a 10-year sentence
and the victim will get compensation?

883
01:12:31,766 --> 01:12:34,266
Wow, very good!

884
01:12:35,599 --> 01:12:39,057
Come on everyone... stop playing
NGO-NGO, and go home.

885
01:12:39,557 --> 01:12:40,974
Our work here is done.

886
01:12:42,099 --> 01:12:45,141
Now that there's a new law, the crimes
will automatically stop! Isn't it?

887
01:12:52,182 --> 01:12:54,766
Acid is sold cheaper than cola
in this country.

888
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:59,538
Your Petition has been stuck for 7 years...
And you want to celebrate?

889
01:13:01,099 --> 01:13:03,682
Acid is still not banned. Get it?

890
01:13:09,599 --> 01:13:11,807
Amol Sir, you know
what your problem is?

891
01:13:14,442 --> 01:13:16,984
You behave like you've been
attacked with acid...

892
01:13:19,516 --> 01:13:21,682
But the acid was thrown on me, not you...

893
01:13:24,523 --> 01:13:25,731
And I...

894
01:13:28,224 --> 01:13:29,224
...would like to party.

895
01:13:44,223 --> 01:13:45,563
Don't overreact now.

896
01:13:45,641 --> 01:13:47,516
Come on, Amol Sir.
Everyone is waiting for you downstairs.

897
01:13:47,558 --> 01:13:50,145
Everyone is calling you and
you're sulking here. Not done.

898
01:13:50,182 --> 01:13:51,573
What nonsense!

899
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:54,978
- I don't want to come.
- How can we party without you?

900
01:13:56,278 --> 01:13:58,387
It doesn't look nice,
everyone's here to receive you...

901
01:13:58,557 --> 01:14:00,890
- Party all by ourselves...
- How can we party by ourselves!

902
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:01,950
See, eyeryone's waiting!

903
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:08,700
He's smiling, now he'll come.

904
01:14:12,016 --> 01:14:14,516
Give him a cold drink!

905
01:14:14,766 --> 01:14:16,016
Great!

906
01:14:17,871 --> 01:14:20,663
<i>According the court records,</i>
<i>and as far as I recall...</i>

907
01:14:20,974 --> 01:14:23,682
<i>Two years ago, back in 2011...</i>

908
01:14:23,974 --> 01:14:25,474
this bench had put forth some directives.

909
01:14:26,141 --> 01:14:27,974
Every state was asked

910
01:14:28,391 --> 01:14:33,307
to submit a proposal to regulate the
sale of acid.

911
01:14:33,932 --> 01:14:36,474
A period of two months was granted.
It's been two years.

912
01:14:36,891 --> 01:14:42,391
So far, we haven't seen any concrete
report on the Ban or the Compensation.

913
01:14:45,432 --> 01:14:48,766
Are you likely to present something today,
Mr Solicitor General?

914
01:14:48,866 --> 01:14:49,991
Yes, Your Lordship.

915
01:14:50,724 --> 01:14:53,849
Luckily, the Home Minister met the
concerned Secretaries of State a month ago.

916
01:14:54,016 --> 01:14:55,516
There was a meeting on National Security.

917
01:14:55,682 --> 01:14:57,516
We also discussed the sale of acid.

918
01:14:57,641 --> 01:14:59,502
What do you mean, 'also discussed'?

919
01:15:00,919 --> 01:15:05,044
Why does it sound like the government
isn't taking this issue seriously?

920
01:15:05,141 --> 01:15:08,307
Apologies, Your Lordship.
That's not what I meant.

921
01:15:08,682 --> 01:15:10,266
Anyway, please continue.

922
01:15:10,682 --> 01:15:14,141
Your Lordship, we request the
court to grant us another date.

923
01:15:14,641 --> 01:15:15,266
Why?

924
01:15:16,083 --> 01:15:17,958
The Chemicals Minister
couldn't come today.

925
01:15:18,391 --> 01:15:20,141
It's like we are running a school!

926
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:21,867
Why is he absent?

927
01:15:22,099 --> 01:15:23,516
His son is getting married.

928
01:15:25,141 --> 01:15:26,391
I'll tell you what...

929
01:15:27,349 --> 01:15:28,766
If, by the next hearing,

930
01:15:29,099 --> 01:15:33,807
all the States do not present
their proposals before the court...

931
01:15:34,327 --> 01:15:37,327
Then this bench will not hesitate

932
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:44,290
to give a final decision on
learned counsel Ms Bajaj's petition.

933
01:15:45,831 --> 01:15:47,790
- Is that clear?
- Yes Sir.

934
01:15:51,182 --> 01:15:53,974
- One bottle of acid.
- Sulphuric or Hydrochloric?

935
01:15:54,496 --> 01:15:55,788
Which one's deadlier?

936
01:15:57,641 --> 01:16:00,516
<i>Today, Manish from 'Stop Acid Violence'</i>
<i>went to a store near our office</i>

937
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:01,473
Thirty.

938
01:16:01,516 --> 01:16:03,557
<i>and bought a bottle of acid.</i>

939
01:16:04,391 --> 01:16:06,266
<i>No one stopped or questioned him.</i>

940
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:10,674
<i>Bought for just 30 rupees, this bottle</i>
<i>of acid stands here so innocuously...</i>

941
01:16:11,307 --> 01:16:14,516
<i>Like it has no idea of the violence</i>
<i>it can unleash.</i>

942
01:16:22,557 --> 01:16:23,891
<i>Last week at a Mumbai station</i>

943
01:16:23,974 --> 01:16:25,932
<i>Pinky Rathore was attacked</i>
<i>with acid in broad daylight.</i>

944
01:16:26,658 --> 01:16:28,658
<i>Not a word or warning...</i>

945
01:16:29,266 --> 01:16:31,683
<i>Someone tapped her shoulder,</i>
<i>hurled acid at her</i>

946
01:16:31,724 --> 01:16:32,849
<i>and disappeared into the crowd.</i>

947
01:16:34,266 --> 01:16:37,599
<i>The entire Chhaaya team has left for Mumbai</i>
<i>to stand in support of Pinky Rathore.</i>

948
01:16:38,432 --> 01:16:40,682
<i>If you would like to help her</i>

949
01:16:41,016 --> 01:16:43,224
<i>please contribute funds</i>
<i>using these bank details.</i>

950
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:46,474
<i>Pinky Rathore's family will be</i>
<i>truly grateful for your support.</i>

951
01:16:46,974 --> 01:16:48,141
Tickets, please.

952
01:17:03,311 --> 01:17:05,394
We'll spark off a rebellion!

953
01:17:07,181 --> 01:17:09,389
We'll whip up a furore!

954
01:17:10,807 --> 01:17:12,932
Our destinies lie in our hands...

955
01:17:14,557 --> 01:17:18,224
We ain't flowers but firebrands!

956
01:17:53,829 --> 01:17:54,954
Yes Amol Sir...

957
01:18:01,052 --> 01:18:03,969
We need to complete the formalities
according to hospital procedure.

958
01:18:04,099 --> 01:18:07,391
We won't accept Pinky's body until
we meet the Chief Minister!

959
01:18:08,954 --> 01:18:13,287
Her face, lungs, heart...
everything was burnt with acid.

960
01:18:14,182 --> 01:18:15,557
No one came to see her.

961
01:18:16,962 --> 01:18:19,629
She kept writing till her last breath,
asking just one question...

962
01:18:20,849 --> 01:18:22,932
"Why did someone do this?"

963
01:18:24,288 --> 01:18:25,405
Why?!

964
01:18:33,996 --> 01:18:35,871
Has the Government made any decision?

965
01:18:36,057 --> 01:18:37,891
Will you transfer the case to the CBI?

966
01:18:38,391 --> 01:18:40,266
When will the victim compensation
be given, Sir?

967
01:18:40,474 --> 01:18:43,693
We met Pinky Rathore's family and
have given them our assurance...

968
01:18:43,766 --> 01:18:45,266
To have faith in the Government.

969
01:18:45,557 --> 01:18:47,663
We've assigned this case to
the Crime Branch

970
01:18:47,766 --> 01:18:50,141
and we believe the attacker
will be caught soon.

971
01:18:50,349 --> 01:18:54,932
"Dreams and desires
are all extinguished"

972
01:18:55,766 --> 01:19:00,557
"The will to live
now entirely demolished"

973
01:19:02,974 --> 01:19:05,141
"All is scorched..."

974
01:19:06,099 --> 01:19:10,724
"Everything is erased..."

975
01:19:10,891 --> 01:19:13,465
<i>The Home Minister has announced</i>

976
01:19:13,641 --> 01:19:16,891
<i>a compensation of 200000 rupees</i>
<i>for Pinky's family.</i>

977
01:19:17,141 --> 01:19:22,809
<i>On the demand for a ban on acid,</i>
<i>he had no response.</i>

978
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:25,077
<i>You can see, even the minister is...</i>

979
01:19:28,976 --> 01:19:30,060
What are you doing here?

980
01:19:34,865 --> 01:19:35,940
Nothing, really...

981
01:19:37,724 --> 01:19:39,419
We have to leave for the station.

982
01:19:43,510 --> 01:19:45,107
This was Pinky's room...

983
01:19:50,188 --> 01:19:52,272
You know, I actually feel
a little jealous of her...

984
01:19:54,003 --> 01:19:55,128
She died...

985
01:19:57,057 --> 01:19:58,057
Why jealous now?

986
01:19:58,474 --> 01:19:59,549
Exactly.

987
01:20:01,657 --> 01:20:03,907
She escaped the ordeal
of courts and surgeries.

988
01:20:05,057 --> 01:20:06,116
Lucky.

989
01:20:08,525 --> 01:20:12,484
I'll give you my sympathies
in the train.

990
01:20:15,182 --> 01:20:16,182
Now come on.

991
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:20,707
Actually... I needed to talk to you.

992
01:20:24,065 --> 01:20:25,399
I hope you won't get me wrong.

993
01:20:29,399 --> 01:20:30,899
Okay, let's reach Delhi first.

994
01:20:30,984 --> 01:20:34,276
What's the matter? Tell me...

995
01:20:39,599 --> 01:20:40,199
I...

996
01:20:41,774 --> 01:20:42,899
What is it?

997
01:20:44,974 --> 01:20:46,349
You're not proposing to me, are you?

998
01:20:54,224 --> 01:20:55,058
Sorry...

999
01:20:57,974 --> 01:21:01,684
I'll have to quit this job. Babbu has
appealed in the High Court.

1000
01:21:02,099 --> 01:21:03,516
Mummy's always worried.

1001
01:21:04,697 --> 01:21:06,899
- The salary isn't paid on time...
- Even we aren't paid on time.

1002
01:21:06,932 --> 01:21:07,974
I know.

1003
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:12,607
But my brother's hospital expenses
are so high, and...

1004
01:21:14,557 --> 01:21:16,599
I thought you were different
from everyone else.

1005
01:21:18,042 --> 01:21:20,209
- That you understood the cause.
- I do understand!

1006
01:21:21,998 --> 01:21:23,957
But I can't do this now...

1007
01:21:24,075 --> 01:21:27,992
Then what was the Petition all about?

1008
01:21:29,747 --> 01:21:30,741
A sham?

1009
01:21:38,391 --> 01:21:39,516
Let it be...

1010
01:21:41,349 --> 01:21:42,349
Do whatever you want.

1011
01:21:48,399 --> 01:21:50,899
<i>"I thought everything</i>
<i>would be fine now."</i>

1012
01:21:51,524 --> 01:21:53,232
<i>"I'd earn well."</i>

1013
01:21:54,097 --> 01:21:58,107
"Send you money and pay my brother
and sister's fees too..."

1014
01:21:59,016 --> 01:22:01,021
"And ease your burden..."

1015
01:22:01,474 --> 01:22:03,224
"But look what happened, Papa!"

1016
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:08,072
"I just want to know who did this,
and why?"

1017
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:10,910
"Papa, please appeal to the police"

1018
01:22:11,057 --> 01:22:13,557
"that the culprit be sentenced
to death."

1019
01:22:14,818 --> 01:22:17,985
"Papa, I don't care
how my face will look..."

1020
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,190
"Just save my life, please."

1021
01:22:20,641 --> 01:22:23,850
"I'll work, earn and
make everything okay."

1022
01:22:24,637 --> 01:22:26,679
"Just save me..."

1023
01:22:27,182 --> 01:22:29,765
"Please get me a good doctor, Papa..."

1024
01:22:31,482 --> 01:22:32,690
End quote.

1025
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:41,440
The letter Pinky Rathore wrote
to her parents after the attack.

1026
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:44,375
Should be anytime now...

1027
01:22:48,523 --> 01:22:54,107
Your Lordship, studying the background
of acid victims and survivors reveals

1028
01:22:54,943 --> 01:22:57,485
that most of the attacks
were on girls

1029
01:22:57,899 --> 01:23:00,774
who wanted to study
or make a career.

1030
01:23:01,641 --> 01:23:06,099
Whenever a girl tried to
better her social status,

1031
01:23:06,952 --> 01:23:08,327
she was punished for it.

1032
01:23:09,649 --> 01:23:13,316
She was shown her place
by dousing her with acid.

1033
01:23:15,307 --> 01:23:18,766
What drives such an act
is impossible to explain.

1034
01:23:20,747 --> 01:23:25,315
But to regulate the sale of acid,
is possible for this bench.

1035
01:23:26,274 --> 01:23:27,899
We cannot bring Pinky back...

1036
01:23:28,224 --> 01:23:31,724
But we can definitely try
to ensure that other girls

1037
01:23:31,766 --> 01:23:34,682
don't suffer like Pinky and Malti did.

1038
01:23:42,842 --> 01:23:47,051
IT'S BANNED!

1039
01:24:03,634 --> 01:24:07,029
Ms Malti, Ms Archana...
Thanks to your Petition

1040
01:24:07,099 --> 01:24:10,262
today the sale of acid has been
regulated across the country.

1041
01:24:10,432 --> 01:24:11,599
How do you feel?

1042
01:24:11,641 --> 01:24:15,308
This is a big victory for you two, would you
like to say something with regards to this?

1043
01:24:17,983 --> 01:24:19,400
The judgement has arrived.

1044
01:24:21,024 --> 01:24:22,649
Archana Ma'am has called us.

1045
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:24,932
<i>Now</i> can we celebrate the ban?

1046
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:29,662
"A retort for every quip"

1047
01:24:31,599 --> 01:24:32,683
Turn there...

1048
01:24:34,141 --> 01:24:36,309
"Smiling away the pinpricks too"

1049
01:24:36,435 --> 01:24:39,394
It's been regulated, not banned.

1050
01:24:39,436 --> 01:24:43,103
"These ties run free of knots"

1051
01:24:43,993 --> 01:24:46,858
"It's the words that entangle you"

1052
01:24:46,899 --> 01:24:48,983
But... haven't you resigned?

1053
01:24:51,961 --> 01:24:53,695
Well, Chhaaya needs me right now.

1054
01:24:53,742 --> 01:24:57,357
"So much they manage to say"

1055
01:24:59,233 --> 01:25:00,482
What are you doing, man?

1056
01:25:00,725 --> 01:25:02,775
Here! Turn here!

1057
01:25:03,167 --> 01:25:04,751
Now take the next turn.

1058
01:25:08,482 --> 01:25:15,399
"What needs to be said
is what's left to say..."

1059
01:25:15,524 --> 01:25:17,899
I need to send an interview byte
to the channel.

1060
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:20,899
- The camera operator's busy.
- Is that why I've been called?

1061
01:25:21,631 --> 01:25:23,548
Fine! I'll record it myself!

1062
01:25:25,361 --> 01:25:26,254
Take this turn ahead...

1063
01:25:29,701 --> 01:25:32,107
Damnit! Stop it, man.

1064
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:33,899
Stop!

1065
01:25:34,732 --> 01:25:36,566
There's a celebrity travelling with us.

1066
01:25:37,530 --> 01:25:39,489
And you have no clue
which way you're going!

1067
01:25:39,932 --> 01:25:42,807
Riding a rickshaw and you don't even
know the routes.

1068
01:25:43,249 --> 01:25:44,374
Twenty's enough!

1069
01:25:44,724 --> 01:25:46,432
Don't you know 'Left' and 'Right'?

1070
01:25:46,932 --> 01:25:49,141
Wasted my time with your
'turn here, turn there'!

1071
01:25:57,035 --> 01:25:58,244
Move your foot!

1072
01:26:06,149 --> 01:26:09,066
Listen... I'm heading to Uncle's.
Ma is waiting there.

1073
01:26:24,879 --> 01:26:27,296
Please come forward,
Honourable Ms Malti!

1074
01:26:43,724 --> 01:26:44,474
Ready?

1075
01:26:45,807 --> 01:26:46,557
A bit to the side...

1076
01:26:50,849 --> 01:26:51,769
The other side!

1077
01:26:55,530 --> 01:26:57,197
Don't you know 'Left' and 'Right'?

1078
01:27:01,275 --> 01:27:02,848
Come on, it wasn't that funny.

1079
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:05,732
Okay fine, move to the right.

1080
01:27:10,474 --> 01:27:11,766
What are you doing?

1081
01:27:12,266 --> 01:27:14,182
Let it be! I can't do it
in front of you.

1082
01:27:14,315 --> 01:27:18,232
Why? Come on, let's start.
The first question...

1083
01:27:18,557 --> 01:27:22,517
The Supreme Court has ruled that the sale
of acid must be regulated in the country.

1084
01:27:22,849 --> 01:27:24,932
Are you happy with
the court's decision?

1085
01:27:25,102 --> 01:27:26,644
Yes, I'm happy.

1086
01:27:31,891 --> 01:27:35,307
There's a long fight still ahead.
You can't look so happy!

1087
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:37,958
But I <i>am</i> happy, what do I do?

1088
01:27:45,266 --> 01:27:46,429
Sorry...

1089
01:27:53,805 --> 01:27:56,389
The sale of acid has been
regulated, not banned.

1090
01:27:56,682 --> 01:28:00,432
Now all schools, shops,
industries etc.

1091
01:28:00,565 --> 01:28:04,524
have to register the sale of acid
or else pay a heavy fine.

1092
01:28:04,989 --> 01:28:09,364
So acid hasn't been banned.
It will still be sold.

1093
01:28:11,474 --> 01:28:15,599
After a struggle of seven years,
we've only won half the battle.

1094
01:28:16,516 --> 01:28:18,047
We still have a long way to go.

1095
01:28:18,482 --> 01:28:21,566
But Malti, your Petition has initiated

1096
01:28:21,608 --> 01:28:26,483
<i>a significant step in</i>
<i>Acid Violence Legislation.</i>

1097
01:28:26,674 --> 01:28:29,133
<i>The foundation of this Petition</i>
<i>is Archana Bajaj Ma'am.</i>

1098
01:28:30,391 --> 01:28:34,474
<i>Right from the outset, she has</i>
<i>believed that to stop this crime</i>

1099
01:28:34,649 --> 01:28:36,024
<i>we need to understand its roots.</i>

1100
01:28:36,190 --> 01:28:38,857
<i>Malti, those who threw acid on you...</i>

1101
01:28:39,124 --> 01:28:42,665
Do they know that you are
spearheading this campaign?

1102
01:28:43,742 --> 01:28:46,034
I don't know if they're aware of it.

1103
01:28:48,916 --> 01:28:50,416
It's good if they are.

1104
01:28:53,289 --> 01:28:54,498
She is very good.

1105
01:28:56,232 --> 01:28:57,248
She is.

1106
01:29:03,141 --> 01:29:04,557
Why did you refuse Alka's offer?

1107
01:29:07,315 --> 01:29:08,857
Jeetu, you go... I'll manage.

1108
01:29:11,482 --> 01:29:13,941
This is a great chance for you...
To become a TV anchor.

1109
01:29:14,141 --> 01:29:16,391
People will know you, and through you,
they'll know of our cause.

1110
01:29:17,047 --> 01:29:18,714
But I am working for the cause here.

1111
01:29:18,766 --> 01:29:21,724
But we can't pay your salary on time.
Then you have problems at home.

1112
01:29:26,357 --> 01:29:29,107
You know... it's all before you...

1113
01:29:31,241 --> 01:29:34,158
Ever since I quit journalism, I haven't
been able to buy myself a new shirt.

1114
01:29:35,266 --> 01:29:36,599
This path isn't easy.

1115
01:29:37,482 --> 01:29:39,526
I feel uncomfortable
in front of the camera.

1116
01:29:39,567 --> 01:29:41,274
You're not uncomfortable at all.

1117
01:29:41,315 --> 01:29:43,232
You say whatever you like,
you do as you please.

1118
01:29:43,982 --> 01:29:45,691
Did I say something wrong?

1119
01:29:47,232 --> 01:29:51,024
No... but that day outside the court?

1120
01:29:53,266 --> 01:29:55,474
The entire media's gaze is on you.

1121
01:29:56,849 --> 01:29:58,891
You can't just jump up
and hug anyone!

1122
01:30:05,349 --> 01:30:07,348
I didn't hug just 'anyone'.

1123
01:30:10,849 --> 01:30:12,724
I hugged someone who was special...

1124
01:30:18,182 --> 01:30:20,194
This stuff belongs in the movies.

1125
01:30:20,807 --> 01:30:22,599
We're here to work...
let's stick to that.

1126
01:30:31,474 --> 01:30:34,724
If someone loves you silently,
why is it a problem?

1127
01:30:37,386 --> 01:30:38,803
You carry on with your work.

1128
01:30:43,182 --> 01:30:46,432
"In the shade of a shared pain"

1129
01:30:48,045 --> 01:30:51,545
"They embraced each other"

1130
01:30:52,972 --> 01:30:57,264
"Who once were strangers"

1131
01:30:57,682 --> 01:31:01,682
"Now walk on together "

1132
01:31:02,772 --> 01:31:07,106
"So much they've managed to say"

1133
01:31:07,628 --> 01:31:11,295
"So much has now been heard"

1134
01:31:12,450 --> 01:31:17,117
"Only the eyes will speak further"

1135
01:31:17,307 --> 01:31:19,016
"What remains unsaid"

1136
01:31:19,762 --> 01:31:26,846
"What remains unsaid
Is what's left to say..."

1137
01:31:36,057 --> 01:31:37,182
Malti... we're ready.

1138
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:49,732
Hello and welcome to
<i>The Delhi Daily</i>.

1139
01:31:50,190 --> 01:31:53,190
<i>I'm Malti Agarwal, and today we'll talk</i>
<i>about Child Rights and Protection...</i>

1140
01:31:54,766 --> 01:31:59,057
Good for her. But she still
doesn't answer her phone.

1141
01:31:59,481 --> 01:32:02,023
- She doesn't think much of you...
- Whatever.

1142
01:32:04,764 --> 01:32:07,973
Okay, should I call her about
the High Court hearing, or will you?

1143
01:32:09,274 --> 01:32:10,274
You do it.

1144
01:32:14,182 --> 01:32:14,890
Sister.

1145
01:32:26,099 --> 01:32:27,349
Come on, eat something.

1146
01:32:30,349 --> 01:32:31,724
This is a good hospital...

1147
01:32:33,889 --> 01:32:35,889
Trust me, Rohit will soon
be back home, healthy.

1148
01:32:53,891 --> 01:32:54,891
Salary...

1149
01:33:28,389 --> 01:33:29,056
Hello...

1150
01:33:29,099 --> 01:33:32,932
Malti Madam... You've become such a star.
You never answer your phone!

1151
01:33:34,974 --> 01:33:36,205
Come on, Archana Ma'am...

1152
01:33:36,766 --> 01:33:39,807
Felt good to see you on TV.
You made me proud!

1153
01:33:44,850 --> 01:33:46,639
<i>It's all because of you</i>
<i>Archana Ma'am.</i>

1154
01:33:48,099 --> 01:33:49,516
<i>I had completely given up.</i>

1155
01:33:54,743 --> 01:33:57,202
All the TV interviews have made you
a smart speaker!

1156
01:33:59,374 --> 01:34:01,496
Okay, the High Court's date
is drawing close.

1157
01:34:01,634 --> 01:34:03,139
<i>These could be the final hearings.</i>

1158
01:34:03,349 --> 01:34:06,391
<i>You're so busy these days,</i>
<i>you may not remember.</i>

1159
01:34:07,946 --> 01:34:09,280
How can I forget...

1160
01:34:11,139 --> 01:34:12,806
Well, I'll be happy if you do.

1161
01:34:14,115 --> 01:34:16,824
<i>Babbu's shadow has followed you</i>
<i>for too many years now.</i>

1162
01:34:25,299 --> 01:34:27,674
I thought you said you
don't like expensive gifts.

1163
01:34:29,098 --> 01:34:30,557
You alone have the right?

1164
01:34:32,057 --> 01:34:33,474
To love 'silently'?

1165
01:34:45,266 --> 01:34:46,641
Will you take me for the hearing?

1166
01:34:50,806 --> 01:34:52,973
I can't just take anyone now, can I?

1167
01:34:53,766 --> 01:34:55,266
Well, I'm not just 'anyone' now, am I?

1168
01:34:56,724 --> 01:34:57,879
You said it yourself...

1169
01:34:58,456 --> 01:34:59,456
I'm 'special'.

1170
01:35:25,630 --> 01:35:26,839
I want to see him.

1171
01:35:29,516 --> 01:35:30,891
What's there to see?

1172
01:35:34,891 --> 01:35:36,682
I want to know why he did it.

1173
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:40,441
If you figure it out,
explain it to me too...

1174
01:35:43,437 --> 01:35:45,729
There's evil in each of us...
that is certain.

1175
01:35:48,461 --> 01:35:51,170
But how does one succumb
to evil so completely

1176
01:35:51,348 --> 01:35:53,140
that they totally lose control?

1177
01:35:56,564 --> 01:35:59,856
Because it's also certain that
acid poisons the mind first...

1178
01:36:02,807 --> 01:36:04,141
then comes into the hands.

1179
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:09,586
"There was a glass in the hand,
and acid in the glass..."

1180
01:36:10,057 --> 01:36:12,265
This detail isn't present
in any of Ms Malti's statements.

1181
01:36:12,557 --> 01:36:14,349
She said this for the first time
in the court.

1182
01:36:15,057 --> 01:36:18,516
Your Lordship, the Defense Counsel
is overlooking

1183
01:36:18,557 --> 01:36:21,370
Malti's physical and mental state
at the time.

1184
01:36:21,653 --> 01:36:22,445
In such a condition,

1185
01:36:22,474 --> 01:36:25,432
it's difficult to give a statement
or remember every small detail.

1186
01:36:25,807 --> 01:36:28,932
This medical report states exactly that,
Your Lordship.

1187
01:36:29,849 --> 01:36:33,766
Alright, fine. I assume she was better
when she appeared in court.

1188
01:36:35,016 --> 01:36:38,724
In court, Ms Malti testified that
my client had worn a helmet.

1189
01:36:38,849 --> 01:36:41,552
Then how did she recognize
his face so clearly?

1190
01:36:41,599 --> 01:36:45,307
The helmet didn't have a visor, because
of which the attacker's face was visible.

1191
01:36:46,136 --> 01:36:48,881
Also, my client knew Babbu.
He wasn't a stranger.

1192
01:36:48,932 --> 01:36:50,557
So it was easy to identify him.

1193
01:36:50,974 --> 01:36:52,932
The Sessions Court records also state

1194
01:36:53,432 --> 01:36:57,057
that Malti did not identify my
client in her first statement.

1195
01:36:57,391 --> 01:37:00,807
She named my client only in
her second statement.

1196
01:37:01,057 --> 01:37:04,516
Your Lordship, the Sessions Court
records clearly state

1197
01:37:04,599 --> 01:37:07,307
that Malti named the defendant
in the hospital,

1198
01:37:07,516 --> 01:37:11,307
but no one understood it
as her speech wasn't clear.

1199
01:37:12,391 --> 01:37:14,266
If my client was guilty,

1200
01:37:14,307 --> 01:37:16,980
why would he come to visit Malti
in the hospital after the attack?

1201
01:37:17,816 --> 01:37:20,933
Perhaps the defendant wanted to check
if Malti had seen him or not?

1202
01:37:20,974 --> 01:37:22,432
Whether she would identify him or not?

1203
01:37:22,932 --> 01:37:25,516
Human behaviour is unpredictable,
Your Lordship.

1204
01:37:25,724 --> 01:37:29,557
Two people could behave differently
in the same circumstance.

1205
01:37:30,516 --> 01:37:32,190
The point I am trying to make

1206
01:37:32,389 --> 01:37:36,056
is that Malti is the sole
eyewitness to this attack.

1207
01:37:36,264 --> 01:37:39,139
And there can be no stronger evidence
than her testimony itself.

1208
01:37:39,224 --> 01:37:43,099
And we shouldn't rely solely
on her testimony,

1209
01:37:43,313 --> 01:37:45,272
because she has been continuously
changing her statements.

1210
01:37:50,556 --> 01:37:56,155
Your Lordship, I request the court
to allow Malti to say something.

1211
01:38:48,349 --> 01:38:50,099
You should've let me stitch
your first outfit.

1212
01:38:50,641 --> 01:38:51,807
I'd have made sure it fits well.

1213
01:38:52,641 --> 01:38:53,675
It's Mummy's...

1214
01:38:54,307 --> 01:38:55,932
I used to think you're still
a little girl.

1215
01:38:57,223 --> 01:39:00,348
But you're quite a woman now.

1216
01:39:04,473 --> 01:39:05,890
I'm getting late for my tuition, Brother...

1217
01:39:06,057 --> 01:39:07,098
Come, I'll drop you.

1218
01:39:07,307 --> 01:39:08,932
- I'll manage...
- Come on, sit.

1219
01:39:10,431 --> 01:39:12,098
I drop your mother to the
market too... Come.

1220
01:39:52,624 --> 01:39:53,799
Hey, this is really spicy!

1221
01:40:05,056 --> 01:40:05,931
Bye.

1222
01:40:16,088 --> 01:40:17,505
Okay, no further from here.

1223
01:40:18,807 --> 01:40:20,359
Just till there.

1224
01:40:22,021 --> 01:40:23,052
Please?

1225
01:40:30,807 --> 01:40:33,606
Why are you walking so fast?
Slow down...

1226
01:40:40,181 --> 01:40:41,848
So shall we meet in the evening?

1227
01:40:42,139 --> 01:40:43,389
What will I say at home?

1228
01:40:43,598 --> 01:40:45,557
That you're going for tuitions.

1229
01:40:54,181 --> 01:40:56,223
Hey you! Who are you?
What's happening here?

1230
01:40:56,266 --> 01:40:58,349
- What's up, Uncle?
- What's up? I'll tell you what's up!

1231
01:40:58,432 --> 01:41:00,265
- Brother! Brother, please!
- I'll tell you what's up!

1232
01:41:00,549 --> 01:41:03,049
- And you! Shameless!
You come home with me... - Brother!

1233
01:41:03,349 --> 01:41:04,505
What's this... how can you force her?

1234
01:41:04,557 --> 01:41:06,474
You want me to show you how?
Do you?

1235
01:41:06,516 --> 01:41:07,391
Rajesh! You go...

1236
01:41:07,432 --> 01:41:08,131
Really?

1237
01:41:08,442 --> 01:41:09,567
'Rajesh, you go'...

1238
01:41:09,641 --> 01:41:11,391
- Sorry, Brother.
- So much concern for him?

1239
01:41:11,432 --> 01:41:12,307
Sorry, Brother.

1240
01:41:12,932 --> 01:41:13,993
Get lost, dipshit!

1241
01:41:14,266 --> 01:41:16,083
- Don't be seen around this colony again!
- Brother, please!

1242
01:41:16,131 --> 01:41:17,145
Should I tell your father
about your antics?

1243
01:41:17,182 --> 01:41:20,224
- Don't tell him... please...
- He'll break your legs. Understand?

1244
01:41:20,343 --> 01:41:21,289
Don't tell Papa... Brother, please.

1245
01:41:21,349 --> 01:41:25,121
I'm not your 'brother'... got it?!

1246
01:41:26,016 --> 01:41:27,682
I'm NOT your brother!

1247
01:41:37,224 --> 01:41:39,099
Is there any dessert?

1248
01:41:39,432 --> 01:41:43,141
Have sugar. It's the month's end,
we can't afford dessert.

1249
01:42:05,139 --> 01:42:07,056
'I Love You'

1250
01:42:44,709 --> 01:42:45,708
Malti?

1251
01:42:48,571 --> 01:42:49,514
Malti...

1252
01:42:52,576 --> 01:42:53,659
You quit school?

1253
01:42:54,266 --> 01:42:57,641
I told you, you must complete
your studies anyhow.

1254
01:42:57,896 --> 01:42:58,476
Shiraz Aunty...

1255
01:42:58,557 --> 01:43:00,891
You can open up so many
avenues for yourself, Malti...

1256
01:43:01,349 --> 01:43:03,016
It's not what you think.

1257
01:43:04,182 --> 01:43:06,473
Come. Let me show you...

1258
01:43:29,332 --> 01:43:31,181
The classes begin on the 1st.

1259
01:43:32,557 --> 01:43:33,974
The bookshop was just an excuse.

1260
01:43:35,877 --> 01:43:38,502
I'll be India's next Idol, Shiraz Aunty!

1261
01:44:09,307 --> 01:44:12,891
'I want to marry you.
Give me an answer now.'

1262
01:44:33,842 --> 01:44:35,335
- Bye.
- Take care.

1263
01:46:02,724 --> 01:46:03,682
Yes?

1264
01:46:09,224 --> 01:46:10,182
Hello?

1265
01:46:11,266 --> 01:46:12,891
<i>You have big dreams, don't you?</i>

1266
01:46:16,932 --> 01:46:17,891
What?

1267
01:46:18,807 --> 01:46:20,849
<i>Want to make your parents proud?</i>

1268
01:46:25,516 --> 01:46:26,529
What?

1269
01:47:06,335 --> 01:47:07,793
You!

1270
01:48:52,058 --> 01:48:54,308
Upholding the lower court's decision...

1271
01:48:54,932 --> 01:48:58,724
this court rejects the Defense's appeal.

1272
01:49:00,391 --> 01:49:01,891
And under Section 307,

1273
01:49:02,849 --> 01:49:06,724
sentences the guilty Bashir Khan to
10 years of rigorous imprisonment

1274
01:49:07,807 --> 01:49:10,557
and orders him to pay a compensation
of 300000 rupees.

1275
01:49:40,016 --> 01:49:42,469
Ms. Malti!

1276
01:49:44,490 --> 01:49:48,107
Ms. Malti, what's your
response to this decision?

1277
01:49:58,349 --> 01:50:02,432
"Old paths long and lost"

1278
01:50:03,094 --> 01:50:07,552
"Have now found a new way"

1279
01:50:07,641 --> 01:50:09,224
"What remains unsaid"

1280
01:50:09,338 --> 01:50:16,004
"Is what's left to say..."

1281
01:50:16,678 --> 01:50:20,844
"Is what's left to say..."

1282
01:50:20,932 --> 01:50:30,224
"Only the eyes will speak further now..."

1283
01:50:32,224 --> 01:50:34,486
"What remains unsaid"

1284
01:50:35,016 --> 01:50:37,891
"Is what's left to say..."

1285
01:50:38,834 --> 01:50:43,209
"Is what's left to say..."

1286
01:50:59,133 --> 01:51:01,335
- Let's take a selfie!
- Come.

1287
01:51:06,590 --> 01:51:08,295
Thanks, I'm posting this!

1288
01:51:12,682 --> 01:51:15,599
You look so pretty!
Come take a selfie with me.

1289
01:51:17,311 --> 01:51:17,837
Come.

1290
01:51:17,891 --> 01:51:19,682
Wait, wait... me too!

1291
01:51:33,641 --> 01:51:37,891
"It was here for a moment"

1292
01:51:40,182 --> 01:51:44,932
"Within a moment it got lost"

1293
01:51:45,932 --> 01:51:51,432
"Just because of one fierce glance..."

1294
01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:59,016
"The world was up in flames"

1295
01:52:08,318 --> 01:52:11,951
"A smile defaced
wiped out of sight"

1296
01:52:11,974 --> 01:52:15,224
"In the sprinkle of a spark"

1297
01:52:15,807 --> 01:52:20,099
"In a splash, all erased..."

1298
01:52:26,497 --> 01:52:30,106
"The face fades
like a fallen pawn"

1299
01:52:30,146 --> 01:52:33,562
"Like light smothered by the dark"

1300
01:52:33,988 --> 01:52:39,613
"In a splash, all erased..."

1301
01:52:44,644 --> 01:52:51,186
"Neither love, nor longing"

1302
01:52:51,849 --> 01:52:55,974
"No promises to be kept"

1303
01:52:57,328 --> 01:53:01,161
"Neither love, nor longing
no promises to be kept"

1304
01:53:01,449 --> 01:53:04,642
"A handful of darkness
the eyes are intent"

1305
01:53:04,683 --> 01:53:08,266
"A smile defaced
wiped out of sight"

1306
01:53:08,307 --> 01:53:11,807
"In the sprinkle of a spark"

1307
01:53:12,141 --> 01:53:16,724
"In a splash, all erased..."

1308
01:53:17,402 --> 01:53:20,985
"The face fades
like a fallen pawn"

1309
01:53:21,027 --> 01:53:24,300
"Like light smothered by the dark"

1310
01:53:24,902 --> 01:53:30,777
"In a splash, all erased..."

1311
01:53:57,386 --> 01:54:02,220
"A meaningless fetish"

1312
01:54:04,675 --> 01:54:08,092
"Raging smoke without fire"

1313
01:54:10,099 --> 01:54:13,932
"A meaningless fetish
raging smoke without fire"

1314
01:54:14,058 --> 01:54:17,355
"The mind is delirious
the thoughts are dire"

1315
01:54:17,433 --> 01:54:21,016
"A smile defaced
wiped out of sight"

1316
01:54:21,058 --> 01:54:24,432
"In the sprinkle of a spark"

1317
01:54:24,891 --> 01:54:28,266
"In a splash, all erased..."

1318
01:54:30,099 --> 01:54:33,766
"The face fades
like a fallen pawn"

1319
01:54:33,807 --> 01:54:37,183
"Like light smothered by the dark"

1320
01:54:37,641 --> 01:54:43,682
"In a splash, all erased..."

1321
01:55:25,152 --> 01:55:29,824
"Dreams and desires
are all extinguished"

1322
01:55:32,457 --> 01:55:37,582
"The will to live
now entirely demolished"

1323
01:55:39,707 --> 01:55:43,269
"Dreams and desires
are all extinguished"

1324
01:55:43,307 --> 01:55:48,057
"The will to live
now entirely demolished"

1325
01:55:48,724 --> 01:55:51,057
"All is scorched..."

1326
01:55:51,901 --> 01:55:54,354
"A smile defaced..."

1327
01:55:59,198 --> 01:56:02,823
"The face fades
like a fallen pawn"

1328
01:56:02,891 --> 01:56:06,474
"Like light smothered by the dark"

1329
01:56:06,682 --> 01:56:10,182
"In a splash, all erased..."

1330
01:56:13,974 --> 01:56:18,099
"In a splash, all erased..."

1331
01:56:21,050 --> 01:56:24,425
"All is scorched..."

1332
01:56:26,549 --> 01:56:30,382
"Everything is erased..."
