00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,450
Your dignity is safe at least.

364
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,360
Listen to me and drop this.

365
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,950
No, man... Try and try till you fly.

366
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,450
It’s die, I think.

367
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,950
Because I am trying to fly but not to die.

368
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,990
Oh my Michelle Francis!

369
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
Look. Chaitra is coming.

370
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,150
Hi. Oh! Thank you.

371
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,570
What's with the flower in your hand?

372
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,490
I'm talking to you!
Answer me.

373
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,860
Physics!
[COUGHS]

374
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,450
Do you have physics notes, sister?

375
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,450
How dare you call me sister!

376
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,320
What happened to your wings?

377
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,950
My fate crushed them.

378
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,070
You know what?

379
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,490
That’s fate bro.

380
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,400
In your situation,
it is much worse.

381
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,400
Listen to me and give this up.

382
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,650
No, man. Not this time.

383
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,150
You will never understand. Never.

384
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,860
You are the one who should understand.

385
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,280
All I need is a change in my life.
And I will bring that change.

386
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,450
He’s talking about change like a politician.

387
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,070
Stop!

388
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,320
Stop right there.

389
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,570
I cannot express myself
if I look into your eyes.

390
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,280
I cannot stop myself from
looking at you either.

391
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,900
But I have to say it.

392
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,450
I like you.

393
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,490
If you have the same feelings for me...

394
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,950
Will you stand by me forever?

395
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,740
I will. I will be with you forever.

396
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,450
I will hold your hand and never let go.

397
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,450
I will not leave you even
if you try to go away.

398
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,070
Why do you interrupt my
dialogue all the time?

399
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,450
Damn! I will never act again.

400
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,450
Fate!

401
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:36,780
Sorry! I was just rehearsing.

402
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,860
I also rehearsed it before.

403
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,740
But, I never got the chance to say it.

404
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:44,360
- I am really sorry.
- It's okay. I am used to it.

405
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:46,150
I came here to say something.

406
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,740
But something else happened.

407
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,450
- Don’t feel so bad.
- Okay.

408
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,990
I am sorry if I troubled you.

409
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,150
I will see you in the next
life if my fate ever changes.

410
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,450
See you.

411
00:30:59,150 --> 00:30:59,990
Vicky!

412
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,990
I can't make it sound as
dramatic as the dialogue.

413
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:08,990
But I can do better if
you give me some time.

414
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,950
I've always wanted to say it, you know.

415
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,900
It won't take much longer.

416
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,450
What?!

417
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,450
You want me to say everything here?
They are watching us.

418
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,530
Let them see. Say it.

419
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,450
Let’s get out of here.

420
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,530
“I had a lovely dream
that touched my heart”

421
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:59,320
“There’s been a strike at this moment”

422
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:04,450
“There is oxygen in all directions”

423
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:08,740
“But, this feeling takes away my breath”

424
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:14,070
“An implicit love is now expressed”

425
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,650
“I thought she would not agree”

426
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,780
“But, this lady accepts my love”

427
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,490
“My dream comes true all of a sudden”

428
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:25,450
“Takes me to a long drive”

429
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:31,280
“She just blew my mind”

430
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,150
“She just blew my mind”

431
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:43,200
“Oh my God! Such a handsome guy”

432
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:50,360
“Oh my God! Such a handsome guy”

433
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:55,450
“He embraces me with a sweet gesture”

434
00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:00,200
“This smart guy with bad luck”

435
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:05,150
“He’s got lucky and has become mine”

436
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,530
“Nothing can stop him now”

437
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:16,450
"This guy...”

438
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,450
No recording.
You’re always on your phone!

439
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,450
Instagram, selfies and all!

440
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:25,320
You literally have nothing else to do.

441
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,650
Don’t record, Chaitra.
Stop acting like a child.

442
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,070
- Are you okay?
- Chaitra!

443
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,450
“I feel like I am on cloud 9”

444
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:48,530
“I'm congratulating myself”

445
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:53,150
“In my journey with her…”

446
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,780
“I came across many good signs”

447
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,900
“My fate changes with this sweet
heart’s bonding”

448
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:08,650
“My luck takes a new turn”

449
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:13,450
“I suddenly started liking me”

450
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:18,740
“She just blew my mind”

451
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:23,570
“She just blew my mind”

452
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:31,320
“Oh my God! Such a hesitant guy”

453
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:37,950
“Oh my God! Such a hesitant guy”

454
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:42,950
“He’s deeply in love now”

455
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,650
“He managed to make me fall in love”

456
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:58,110
“This is how the story goes
along together..."

457
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:02,450
"My life!”

458
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,450
I want to see you in a saree.

459
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,990
“My Lord! Administer this floret”

460
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:51,900
“My Lord! Administer this floret”

461
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,950
“With a glint, you are the
master of God’s army”

462
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,450
“My Lord! Administer this floret”

463
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:06,700
“With a glint, you are the
master of God’s army”

464
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:11,860
“My Lord! Administer this floret”

465
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:32,950
What happened?

466
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,450
I am scared.

467
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,650
About what?

468
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,200
About you.

469
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,450
What?

470
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,450
Nothing good ever happened in my life.

471
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,780
Even if it did, something
bad would soon follow.

472
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,150
And...

473
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,860
You are the best thing that
ever happened to me.

474
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,700
That is why I am worried about
what might happen in life.

475
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,570
Because...

476
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,700
I don’t want to lose you.

477
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,860
Like...

478
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:12,400
Ever!

479
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,570
You won’t.

480
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:16,320
You know…

481
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,110
For the first time in my life...

482
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,490
I feel so lucky.

483
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,780
Being here...

484
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,740
With you...

485
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,650
Just to look into your eyes...

486
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,950
And take a deep breath.

487
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,320
Err... I am so sorry.

488
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,650
Hey! Look at this.

489
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,320
Chaitra!

490
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:53,530
- Do you remember this video?
- Hey! Why did you upload it?

491
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:54,990
I did not.

492
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,450
In fact, I'm seeing it
for the first time.

493
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,110
How is it possible?

494
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,070
Hey! I don’t know.

495
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:01,320
Chaitra! Please delete that video.

496
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,320
No way. See? So many
people watched the video.

497
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,200
Look at the number of views.
You are viral! -Bah!

498
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,700
You know I don’t like all this. Please.

499
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,490
There is no way I am deleting this...
- Chaitra! Please.

500
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,450
Please…Please…

501
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:13,320
Fine!

502
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,570
Okay. Thank you.

503
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,150
- Let’s take a picture.
- No!

504
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,450
- Come
- No!

505
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:20,780
Come. Come. Come on!

506
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,110
Professor!

507
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,570
Professor...

508
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:13,570
Hey!
-Whoa!

509
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,700
Sir. It’s me.

510
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:18,490
- What are you doing here?
- As usual, just a casual visit.

511
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,070
What happened?
Why aren’t you answering my calls ?

512
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,150
I didn’t check.

513
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:29,110
- Why aren’t you attending college?
- I am in a bad mood.

514
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,780
What's wrong, sir?

515
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,900
Why are you so...?

516
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:38,280
What are these boxes?

517
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,450
Professor! Is it a new experiment?

518
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,450
You didn’t even tell me.

519
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,700
Hey!

520
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,530
What is your problem?

521
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,320
Acting like an annoying TV reporter!

522
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,400
What are you doing here?

523
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,070
Are you seriously asking me that again?

524
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:58,280
When did we ever need a reason to meet?

525
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,950
Well, we need a reason from now on.

526
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,650
Do you have one?

527
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,360
No! I just came to check on you.

528
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:06,950
Thanks for your concern.

529
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:08,900
I'll shut the door
if you please leave.

530
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,530
Why are you acting weird?

531
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,570
No one's going to give a
damn if you act like this.

532
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,860
- Hey! Go.
- Hey.

533
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,150
- Go!
- Sir.

534
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,360
He's so drunk!

535
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:23,780
Old man has lost his mind.
Damn it!

536
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:27,780
Bye, dad.

537
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:31,110
Whoa! Saree to impress him?

538
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:32,740
Dad, please!

539
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:37,030
Listen. I can understand if
he's an innocent guy.

540
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,280
We can also tolerate a misfit.

541
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,490
But, how can we handle misfortune?

542
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,030
You don’t have to handle him.

543
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:46,450
If you are so scared,
I will keep him away from you

544
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:48,740
I will also stay away.

545
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,780
Why are you getting angry?

546
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,450
I will obviously get angry
if you keep repeating the same thing.

547
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,450
And we'll obviously
be worried about you.

548
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:57,530
You're right.

549
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,150
But it's not necessary.

550
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:02,700
He is a good guy, dad.

551
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,450
He is crushed since everyone
blames him about his bad luck.

552
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,570
He is not confident about himself.

553
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,400
Do you get it?

554
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:13,320
I can see that you
understood him very well.

555
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:14,490
He is so lucky.

556
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:17,110
See, that is what I am talking about.

557
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:18,820
All he needs is a break.

558
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,450
And I want to be that break for him.

559
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,450
That’s what love should do, right?

560
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:24,650
Make people better.

561
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:25,570
Okay.

562
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,950
Why are you moody?

563
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:43,650
I am disturbed.

564
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:47,820
What is it this time?

565
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,950
Too much sarcasm!

566
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:52,570
Who's being sarcastic?

567
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,490
Why will I have a problem
if it’s someone else?

568
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,360
What is your problem anyway?

569
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,200
Why did you delete that video?

570
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,110
You were really upset about it.

571
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,450
So I deleted it.

572
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:10,780
If you cared about me so much,
why did you upload it?

573
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:11,990
Who told you I did it?

574
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,740
Like I said, I have no
idea who uploaded it.

575
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,900
You must have done it.

576
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,900
Or someone else must've
done it from your phone.

577
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:19,820
No one touches my phone, Vicky.

578
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,200
That's my point.

579
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,700
What do you mean?

580
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,900
Why are you being so fussy?

581
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:28,450
I'm not being fussy.
I'm really upset.

582
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:30,740
Whatever!

583
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:31,780
See...

584
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,450
I am not important to you.

585
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,320
I am only as important as a
Whatsapp forward to you.

586
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,450
My life is a form of
entertainment to you.

587
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,360
And my troubles...
They give you loads of joy.

588
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:43,030
You make me follow you around.

589
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,780
Because you enjoy that attention.

590
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,490
I am an unlucky fellow, right?

591
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,450
You've taken me for granted.

592
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:50,360
Vicky!

593
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:52,740
You’re crossing your limit.
You will regret it later.

594
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,570
What the hell!
Let me regret it.

595
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,900
I just hope I'm not a joke to you.

596
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,320
I can’t believe I have to deal
with this right now.

597
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,450
I've taken a lot of shit from you.

598
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:05,450
I've put up with so much for you.

599
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,490
- I fought for you with my dad.
- So did you put up with me?

600
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:12,950
What all did you put up with?
Enlighten me.

601
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,360
Want me to tell you?
Do you really want to know?

602
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:16,700
Tell me. Let’s settle this today.

603
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:18,360

Okay, let’s go.

- Hi, uncle. We meet finally.
- Hi.... How are you?

609
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,150
- Give me a minute.
– Yeah.

610
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,780
It's an important call, I guess.

611
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:49,950
Oh shit!

612
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:10,650
Is that why he didn’t
meet me that day?

613
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,530
There’s more to it.

614
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,820
My granny saw you drop me home that day.
Remember?

615
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:16,950
Yes. After that...

616
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:20,490
She died.

617
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,650
In the time between seeing
you and her dying...

618
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:30,280
We almost lost all our assets.
Why are you still hanging out with him?

619
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:31,990
We almost lost everything.
But we didn't, right?

620
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:33,320
Why are you being so arrogant?

621
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:35,150
You met him and it led to this.

622
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,820

if you married him.

624
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:45,280
I wasn't aware of any of this.

- There’s more...
- That’s enough. Stop it. Please.

626
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:49,200
I am sorry, Chaitra.

627
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:51,990
She’s old.

628
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,450
Her death was kind of obvious.

629
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:57,570
I thought the same.

630
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:59,820
I also fought with my dad for you.

631
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:02,320
I don't have to do that anymore.

632
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,570
Chaitra! I am sorry.

633
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:04,990
Too late, Vicky.

634
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,490
You showed up late once.

635
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,990
You dropped me late the other day.
Out of fear.

636
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:12,450
You took too long to realize your
mistake this time. Out of ego.

637
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,450
I told you you will regret it.

638
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,740
- No, Chaitra.
- No, Vicky.

639
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:20,150
Everyone around you said you're
responsible for the chaos in your life.

640
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,900
But, I gave you the
benefit of the doubt.

641
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,150
I understood that you're
victim of your own fate.

642
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:26,450
I stood by you in your fight.

643
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,280
But, you know what?
You don’t deserve any of this.

644
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:31,200
Chaitra. I made a mistake.

645
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:33,450
Yes, it is over.

I really thought I would be your break.

But, you know what?

00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:40,650
I am done.

Chaitra! You're just proving how
unlucky I am by breaking up with me.

00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,990
You know what, Vicky?

654
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,700
You better stop using
bad luck as an excuse.

in his life as his right.

But when something goes
wrong, he questions it.

715
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:55,700
And if nothing happens, he
blames it on God or evil.

We found you vulnerable.

717
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,280
So we blamed you.

I don’t know, dad.

everyone keeps saying it.

721
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,150
The world has a lot to say.

722
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,400
But you should trust yourself.

723
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,150
You should have a
person who trusts you.

724
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,200
Chaitra trusted you.

725
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,450
She looked beyond the misfortune
and saw in you the other side.

726
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:29,530
She saw the real you.

727
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,110
She is your lucky charm.

728
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:35,740
Don’t lose her.

729
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:39,280
Professor.

730
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,030
Hello?

731
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,360
Hello.

732
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:50,530
Disturbance.

733
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:52,400
Hello.

734
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,110
I will meet him, dad...
It has been many days.

735
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:15,200
Professor!

736
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,200
You! Are you okay?

737
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:27,650
Dad.

738
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:29,150
Sir… Sir!

739
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,200
- Dad.
- Sir…

740
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,900
- Get up, sir.
- Vicky!

741
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:40,110
They are coming. Take Maya with you.

742
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:43,280
Take her away...

743
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:47,900
Sir! Nothing will happen to you, sir.

744
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:03,490
Hey!

745
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,070
Where is the girl?

746
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:07,400
- There’s no girl in here.
- Search for the girl!

747
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:11,150
Where is the girl? Search for her.

748
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,200
What's happening here?

749
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,150
Who are they?

750
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:34,650
I don’t know.

751
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,530
Why are they chasing you?

752
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:37,740
I don’t know.

753
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,400
When did you return from the US?

754
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:42,360
It has been 2 days.

755
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,280
As far as I know, Professor
doesn’t have enemies.

756
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,450
- Did they come for you?
- I don’t know.

757
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,240
Why do you keep repeating
the same thing?

758
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:55,400
What is this, dad?

759
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,280
She is already terrified.

760
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:59,150
Kumari.

761
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:01,400
Come with me.

762
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:08,990
- You have to say something.
- Hush!

763
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:14,150
She is still in shock.

764
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:16,150
You are terrified yourself.

765
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:18,280
Imagine how she must have felt.

766
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:23,360
Try and figure out why Professor
called you in such a situation.

767
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:26,150
Take care of her. Okay?

768
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,740
Maya...

769
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:34,030
Aren’t you feeling sleepy?

770
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:40,820
Why did people choose
the night to sleep?

771
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:43,150
Darkness!

772
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,070
May be we fear darkness.

773
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:50,070
We cannot escape it no matter what.

774
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:56,820
Fear, sadness, emptiness
are all it’s agents.

775
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,150
It might take over us in any form.

776
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,740
When it does...

777
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:10,240
We should come out of it
like rays of sunshine.

778
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,650
But we shouldn’t give up sleeping.

779
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:21,150
Did my dad tell you anything about me?

780
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,030
He used to.

781
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,360
He always spoke about your happiness.

782
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:33,820
It is not fair to him if he becomes
the reason behind your sadness now.

783
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:36,150
I mean, the whole point is lost, right?

784
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:43,150
He never liked it when someone
was sad because of him.

785
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:46,280
Maybe that is why...

786
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:49,650
He kept his distance
with me lately.

787
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:53,110
But I failed to understand him.

788
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,240
Yes...

789
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,900
He doesn’t like sorrow.

790
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:19,700
Who cleaned up this mess?

791
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:29,610
Hubby…

792
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,070
Hubby!

793
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,200
Why are you not responding?

794
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:41,400
Nothing. Just recalling the
losses incurred due to our son.

795
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:44,110
You can do that later.
Something is wrong in our house.

796
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:46,030
Come. I will show you.

797
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:47,030
Let’s go…

798
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,490
See.

799
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:56,150
I get it now.

800
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,650
Don't you?
This is how people in America function.

801
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,150
They do their own chores.

802
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,150
She did all our work as well.

803
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:04,610
Don’t tell our son about it.

804
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,110
Let’s go. Come on.

805
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:10,240
What’s up, mother?

806
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:12,110
Looks like you are having a good time.

807
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,490
Are you done with all the work?

808
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,150
All the work is done.
That new girl did it.

809
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:20,110
Otherwise, I wouldn't have so
much free time on my hand.

810
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,360
New girl? What’s with the new girl?

811
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:24,150
I mean, Maya.

812
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,240
She did everything
before I even woke up.

813
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:27,900
I didn’t ask her to do any of it.

814
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:30,240
How can you make her do the work?
Are you out of your mind?

815
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,700
She’s new here.
How can you?

816
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,610
Why are you taking the trouble?

817
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:44,150
You only told me that my dad
would want me to move on.

818
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,360
So I thought it's better
to keep my mind occupied.

819
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:50,150
Okay, thank you.

820
00:56:58,530 --> 00:56:59,820
Shoot in that gap.

821
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,610
Take position. Quick.

822
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:03,150
Sir...

823
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:06,610
How did you confirm it as an accident?

824
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:09,150
Forensics department confirmed it.

825
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,740
- Did you find any…?
- Focus while you're at it.

826
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:16,740
Sir! Did you find anything suspicious?

827
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:20,860
We checked. Nothing was suspicious.

828
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:23,150
Lodge a complaint if you feel so.
We'll look into it.

829
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,150
It's just a waste of time.

830
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:49,860
Who is he?

831
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:52,240
We got him here because he was
enquiring at the police station.

832
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,610
- Why were you there?
- My Professor is missing.

833
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:58,740
I went to enquire.

834
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:03,200
Why doesn't he buy a
hearing aid already?

835
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:05,150
I can’t bend anymore.

836
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:07,490
[GIBBERISH]

837
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,610
What’s the relation between
you and the professor?

838
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:16,030
We were childhood friends...
I know him since I was a kid.

839
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:20,610
But there’s a generation
gap between you two.

840
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:22,900
That’s a long story.

841
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:25,610
So do you know the Professor very well?

842
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,150
Yeah. You can say that.

843
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:31,200
Guys... Get him a chair.

844
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:37,450
Do you know anything about his daughter?

845
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:39,860
Why are you interested in her?

846
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,820
Why do you care?

847
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:45,150
Chief! He’s young.
He might help you impress her.

848
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:50,740
The thing is I love that girl.

849
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:51,530
Oh!

850
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:53,150
What?! Love?!

851
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:55,860
- Why are you shocked?
- I mean, the age difference...

852
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:58,610
Her dad can be your childhood friend.

853
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:00,820
But she can't be my lover, huh?

854
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:04,030
She could be. Good logic!

855
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:07,150
Unconventional love stories
are in trend now, sir.

856
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:09,900
I watched ‘Cheeni Kam’ movie 30 times.

857
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,150
That movie is my inspiration.

858
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:16,240
Super, sir! Amazing selection.

859
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:18,860
So will you help me out?

860
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:21,650
Bro! You got my full support.

861
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:24,150
I'll come to you as soon as
I have any information on her.

862
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:29,150
Can I leave now?

863
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:30,700
Sure…

864
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,150
Off you go.

865
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:36,610
Hey! Put that down already.

866
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,530
- Drop him in our vehicle.
- See you, bro.

867
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:45,990
Thanks, buddy.

868
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:49,110
No need to thank me.
Just buy a hearing aid.

869
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:50,900
It's a request.

870
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:53,360
Nice tea...

871
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:54,570
Thank you.

872
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,150
Chaitra! I can't believe you came for me!

873
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:02,700
Don’t get excited.
I didn't come here for you.

874
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:05,450
There you are.

875
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,110
I was waiting for you since morning.

876
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:08,570
- Yeah.
- Do you want some water?

877
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,280
No, thanks.

878
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,570
I brought some clothes for you.

879
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:13,490
For me?

880
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:16,700
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

881
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,280
I'll come back.

882
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:26,740
Chaitra…

883
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:28,400
Chaitra…

884
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:30,280
Wait, Chaitra.

885
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:32,110
Chaitra, wait.

886
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,860
Why did you come?
Why are you leaving?

887
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,740
We are planning to organize
Professor’s memorial.

888
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:38,030
I'm here to inform you.

889
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,240
You could've called me
or simply send me a text.

890
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:45,150
Oh! Are you here to see me?

891
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:48,150
You’ve got high expectations
on yourself, huh?

892
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,450
Don't flatter yourself.

893
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:50,990
Chaitra, wait.

894
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:59,900
I somehow feel that
Chaitra still loves you.

895
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,650
I doubt it, mom.

896
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:05,400
She knows how unlucky I am.
A little too well actually.

897
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:08,700
I don’t know about that.

898
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:13,400
But she was jealous when Maya hugged you.

899
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:14,610
- Hmm?
- Hmm.

900
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:22,070
She is jealous.

901
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:23,360
Yes.

902
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,900
“I’ll hold you, I’ll get you”

903
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:43,740
“I’ll throw you out”

904
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:45,990
“I’ll scold you, I’ll smack you”

905
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:48,820
“I’ll drive you out of here”

906
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:52,150
“With your evil magic”

907
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:58,400
“You lured my lover towards you”

908
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:03,150
“He’s the one I kissed before you got here”

909
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:08,240
“You’re dreaming with a guy who was mine”

910
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:13,240
“You feel so happy thinking
that you got a chance”

911
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:18,400
“You aimed to stay beside him
and you remained”

912
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:20,650
“You cunning woman!”

913
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:23,610
“He’s my own lover!”

914
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:26,030
“Don’t touch him”

915
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:28,570
“No… No! Never!!”

916
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:33,490
“Go far from here and never come back”

917
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:51,110
“You can’t become alike with
cappuccino coffee”

918
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:56,150
“You can’t form a bond with
just a movie together”

919
01:02:56,650 --> 01:03:01,570
“Stop enticing him, wily woman”

920
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:06,200
“This is my warning, I'll destroy you”

921
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:09,150
“I am girl like you...”

922
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,700
“So, I will not pick up a fight with you”

923
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:16,450
“I will spare you if you apologize”

924
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,700
“You cunning woman!”

925
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:21,450
“He’s my own lover”

926
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:24,030
“Don’t touch him”

927
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:26,740
“No…No! Never”

928
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:31,490
“Go far from here and never come back”

929
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:04,200
“You took a chance because
I am a cool person”

930
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:09,360
“You got closer to my lover boy”

931
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:12,150
“He’s my lovely guy”

932
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,700
“He started liking you”

933
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:19,570
“What’s special in you that lacks in me?”

934
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:22,400
“If I see the guy who sent you here…”

935
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:29,860
“I will bash him up right now
in front of you”

936
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:32,030
“You cunning woman!”

937
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,820
“He’s my own lover”

938
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:37,280
“Don’t touch him”

939
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:39,820
“No…No! Never”

940
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:44,820
“Go far from here and never come back”

941
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,700
Mr. Acharya was a man of excellence.

942
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:39,150
The services he rendered for
the institution are priceless.

943
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:41,740
But unfortunately, we
lost him in accident.

944
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:45,150
So, if you wish to say
your final goodbyes…

945
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:47,570
Grab your pens. Open your hearts.

946
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:51,360
Get writing and set the balloons free
into the sky.

947
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:01,150
Life is very fragile, Vicky...

948
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:04,360
If you keep waiting for
the right moment...

949
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:07,990
It will pass even before you realize it.

950
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:09,820
And before you comprehend it...

951
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:11,490
You lose the chance to grab it.

952
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,280
Chaitra.

953
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:21,240
Chaitra.

954
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:24,150
Oh!

955
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:26,900
Maya.

956
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:13,150
Who are you?
Dada’s accomplices?

957
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:14,240
Yes.

958
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:16,200
Why did you gang up on me?

959
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:17,700
Hey...

960
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:20,280
You said you don’t know her
when we asked you earlier.

961
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:24,860
I lied to you. So what?

962
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:28,860
Hey! Lets break his bones
and take her with us.

963
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:31,990
Babe... Go and sit.

964
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,030
You know what's going to happen?

965
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:41,280
This beard guy...

966
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:43,610
Will have his back broken.

967
01:07:44,490 --> 01:07:46,360
What should I do with the second guy?

968
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:48,570
I’ll give you a flying kick.

969
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:55,240
Coming to the third guy, I
will smack him up badly.

970
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,110
I will throw him off like a backpack.

971
01:07:57,150 --> 01:07:58,200
Hey… Hey…

972
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:00,650
Who says we're going
to attack one by one?

973
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:03,150
We will surround you
and beat you up.

974
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:04,150
Ready?

975
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:51,150
Why did people choose the night to sleep?

976
01:10:52,650 --> 01:10:53,900
- Why are they chasing you?
- I don’t know.

977
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:54,450
Did my dad tell you anything about me?
- Why are they chasing you?
- I don’t know.

978
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:54,740
Did my dad tell you anything about me?

979
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:55,990
Why do you keep repeating
the same answer?
Did my dad tell you anything about me?

980
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:56,780
Why do you keep repeating
the same answer?

981
01:10:57,150 --> 01:10:58,610
- Who are they?
- I don’t know.

982
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:36,740
Don’t talk anything before that guy.
Let me talk.

983
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:37,780
- Yes, chief.
- Let’s go.

984
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:40,110
Where is this crazy guy?

985
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:42,200
Wait. Wait.
Where are you both going?

986
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:45,200
- Where is that crazy guy?
- He’s inside. Go search for yourself.

987
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:46,530
Wait…

988
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:48,030
Only two people are allowed.

989
01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:49,530
You guys wait here.

990
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:51,150
- Let’s go.
- Go, go…

991
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:54,070
- You guys want to box?
- Come on. Let's fight.

992
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,200
Come!

993
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,280
Sir?!

994
01:11:58,780 --> 01:11:59,950
Where is the crazy guy?

995
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:02,900
Sir.

996
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:05,200
Sir.

997
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:08,110
He’s here!!

998
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,110
He brought it.

999
01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:14,280
Where is my hard disk?

1000
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:17,820
My time has finally come.

1001
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:22,200
I will show them my power.

1002
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:23,990
I will finish everyone.

1003
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:26,320
Actually I came here
to tell you that only.

1004
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:27,820
I need some more time.

1005
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:29,780
What?

1006
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:31,780
You didn’t find it?

1007
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:33,030
No.

1008
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,780
We searched professor’s entire house.

1009
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:37,650
We are also searching for his daughter.

1010
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:44,280
We might get some information
if we find that girl.

1011
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:46,780
Same to same!

1012
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:49,240
Talk.

1013
01:12:49,650 --> 01:12:53,990
I mean I need some time to find his daughter.

1014
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,450
What, sir?

1015
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:01,990
Are you making fun?

1016
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,610
Shut up!

1017
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:04,990
Shut up!

1018
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:07,700
I didn’t find it…
I need some more time….

1019
01:13:09,490 --> 01:13:12,030
Did I hire you to hear that from you?

1020
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,320
You fool!

1021
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:16,030
I hired you so that you will work for me.

1022
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:18,610
I tried, sir.

1023
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:23,900
There is no value for an experiment
in this great world.

1024
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,490
Why will there be a value for trying?

1025
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:29,320
Constipation crisis?

1026
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,110
Oh! That’s the problem.

1027
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:37,610
Empty!

1028
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:39,450
Everything is empty.

1029
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:41,860
Totally empty... Damn!

1030
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,780
Full! It is full.

1031
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:45,820
That’s it.

1032
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:48,400
It is my mistake to hire you.

1033
01:13:48,650 --> 01:13:50,240
It is my mistake...

1034
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:54,780
Daughter’s picture!

1035
01:13:56,650 --> 01:13:58,400
Do you have that professor's
daughter’s picture?

1036
01:13:58,610 --> 01:13:59,780
Yes. I have it.

1037
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:01,280
- Good.
- Send it via whatsapp.

1038
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,200
Okay, chief.

1039
01:14:03,110 --> 01:14:03,820
Whatsapp!

1040
01:14:03,950 --> 01:14:04,650
I sent it.

1041
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,070
Check... I sent it.

1042
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:07,950
I got it.

1043
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,780
- You are fired.
- Fired?

1044
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:16,030
- Out!
- Out?

1045
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:16,700
Out!

1046
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:19,950
- What happened?
- Let’s go. He is stumbling.

1047
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:22,780
Where is my hard disk?

1048
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:25,780
Where is my hard disk?

1049
01:14:26,490 --> 01:14:27,780
Useless fellows!

1050
01:14:28,110 --> 01:14:30,570
All you do is to eat
Biryani and drink beer.

1051
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:32,650
Why are you scolding us, chief?

1052
01:14:33,490 --> 01:14:34,650
I thought he’s the only one.

1053
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:36,110
Are you also shouting on me?

1054
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:39,110
Tell me that you found her at least.

1055
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:42,780
Someone bashed everyone
who went in search of her.

1056
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:44,740
They’re not in a position to talk.

1057
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:45,610
Please.

1058
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:47,650
Find her fast.

1059
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:50,280
We should find her
before this crazy guy.

1060
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:51,530
- Okay, come.
- Hey, move.

1061
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:54,280
I will kick you both into the
air far from this place.

1062
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:55,820
Hey!
What is this?

1063
01:14:56,150 --> 01:14:57,280
Enough fighting. Move!

1064
01:14:57,570 --> 01:14:59,450
Hey! Are you here to eat?

1065
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:00,780
Let’s go.

1066
01:15:01,490 --> 01:15:02,400
Come. Come.

1067
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:22,320
What?

1068
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:23,990
Nothing.

1069
01:15:24,110 --> 01:15:25,240
It’s okay.
You can ask me.

1070
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,490
So you are not human?

1071
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:30,780
Can’t you see?

1072
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:36,030
The professor locked himself for days and
I thought he turned insane due to his age.

1073
01:15:36,650 --> 01:15:37,320
So...

1074
01:15:38,110 --> 01:15:39,450
This is what he did.

1075
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,530
When did he create you?

1076
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:45,450
I was initiated two days
before the accident.

1077
01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:47,780
Why wasn’t I told about this?

1078
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:49,240
That’s for my safety.

1079
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:52,110
How did you manage before everyone?

1080
01:15:52,990 --> 01:15:56,490
My mind was designed to work
just like a human brain.

1081
01:15:56,780 --> 01:16:00,450
To be precise, he replicated
professor daughter’s Neural data.

1082
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:03,820
And my code is installed
with Adaptive Learning Technology.

1083
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:05,650
Are you Maya?

1084
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:07,860
Almost!

1085
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,400
Can you do everything
that a human can do?

1086
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,780
Are you really a robotic student?

1087
01:16:14,530 --> 01:16:16,780
Okay…
I just asked casually.

1088
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:18,360
I can do some.

1089
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:21,780
I can do anything that a human can’t do
if you write a program.

1090
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:23,570
Then...

1091
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:26,570
What about feelings and emotions?

1092
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:27,490
I have them.

1093
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:29,530
But they’re programmed and controlled.

1094
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:31,530
Do you have all emotions?

1095
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:32,900
Except pain!

1096
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,650
You are very lucky.

1097
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:36,780
We are screwed
most of the time because of that.

1098
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:38,240
This is awesome.

1099
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:48,070
So, you are not Maya.

1100
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:49,240
No.

1101
01:16:54,530 --> 01:16:55,780
Can you do me a favor?

1102
01:16:57,490 --> 01:16:59,780
You know Chaitra, right?

1103
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:02,490
This frustrated girl?

1104
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:05,530
Yeah! This frustrated girl.

1105
01:17:06,650 --> 01:17:08,110
I like her a lot.

1106
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,110
But…

1107
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:10,780
Does she hate you?

1108
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:13,860
No…She likes me too
but she is angry with me.

1109
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:15,320
What did you do?

1110
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:18,030
- That’s a long story.
- What should I do?

1111
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:20,990
Nothing...

1112
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:24,610
She thinks that there is something
between us.

1113
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:28,400
So, will you act like my girlfriend
in front of her?

1114
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:29,860
You know what I mean, right?

1115
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:31,740
I know but...

1116
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:33,780
Why should I act like your girlfriend?

1117
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:35,990
Why couldn’t I really
become your girlfriend?

1118
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:39,860
Why did you get that doubt?

1119
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,900
Casually! I asked because you said so.

1120
01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:44,280
Oh!

1121
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:47,030
Okay. So, let me rephrase it.

1122
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:50,030
Can you act like you’re closer to me
in front of Chaitra?

1123
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:05,780
Will this closeness be enough?

1124
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:09,860
Yeah. But Chaitra is not here now.

1125
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:10,900
So... No need.

1126
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:12,320
Okay.

1127
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:40,780
Dude.

1128
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:43,700
I think the washroom is that way.

1129
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:45,780
You won’t understand human problems.

1130
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:02,240
Karun?

1131
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:05,650
Hey.

1132
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:09,650
Whoa... Whoa... Relax brother.

1133
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:11,780
What is this look?

1134
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:14,070
What’s wrong with you, man?
Why are you with Chaitra?

1135
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:16,450
Well, she’s going through a breakup.

1136
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:18,780
…and I am trying to help her.

1137
01:19:18,990 --> 01:19:20,780
It doesn’t look like you are helping her...

1138
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:22,200
It's like you are playing with me.

1139
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:23,150
Me?

1140
01:19:23,530 --> 01:19:24,320
With you?

1141
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:29,150
Come on, buddy. God Himself has been
playing with your life for the past 23 years

1142
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:29,990
Hey!

1143
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:32,450
Why did you change like this?

1144
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:35,740
With Time…
Change is inevitable, bro.

1145
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:39,280
Everyone will change.

1146
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,450
Except you.

1147
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:42,650
Karun!
What are you doing there?

1148
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:45,320
Baby! Order for the drinks...
I’ll be there in a sec.

1149
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:48,700
My dad told me to stay away
from unlucky people.

1150
01:19:50,110 --> 01:19:51,860
Man up, bro! Don’t be a crybaby…

1151
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:52,700
Come on.

1152
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:54,570
Oh! Wow…

1153
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:56,570
What’s up, babe?
What are we doing today?

1154
01:19:56,650 --> 01:19:58,700
I’ll smack you if you touch me...
Go and sit there.

1155
01:19:59,150 --> 01:19:59,990
What happened?

1156
01:20:00,030 --> 01:20:00,950
Shut up and go.

1157
01:20:06,650 --> 01:20:08,110
Are you dating him now?

1158
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:09,900
And you are dating her now?

1159
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:12,900
You know,
we both are best Tik Tok couple.

1160
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:14,860
Shall we start?

1161
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,320
- I am waiting.
- Hashtag! #Me too.

1162
01:20:17,650 --> 01:20:18,860
Look at him…

1163
01:20:25,490 --> 01:20:26,700
Go for it…

1164
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:32,490
Damn my luck!

1165
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:47,700
Yes!

1166
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:49,700
Loser!

1167
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:51,030
It should happen to you.

1168
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:53,360
Come on, my girl... Come on!

1169
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,280
It's okay.

1170
01:20:58,950 --> 01:20:59,860
How?

1171
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:14,900
Yes.

1172
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:16,360
Yes!

1173
01:21:41,650 --> 01:21:42,650
Whoa!

1174
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:44,950
Yes.

1175
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:08,860
Whoa... Yay!

1176
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:15,450
Yes! We won.
- Damn! These balls.

1177
01:23:18,570 --> 01:23:21,650
“I’ve locked you in my eyes”

1178
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:26,450
“You can never escape”

1179
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:31,650
“I don’t even apply mascara”

1180
01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:36,650
“As it might smudge you”

1181
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:39,820
“To add sweetness to my lips”

1182
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:43,740
“I call out your name, my love”

1183
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:47,070
“Oh my love”

1184
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,650
"The world is nothing”

1185
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:52,240
“And I am bewildered”

1186
01:23:52,530 --> 01:23:56,570
“Do you know that this is love?”

1187
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:59,650
“Why is it like this?”

1188
01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:04,650
“Why is it like this?”

1189
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:15,240
“My heart is hassled by you”

1190
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:20,650
“Making it alone”

1191
01:24:37,950 --> 01:24:40,530
“There’s a lot of space in my heart for you”

1192
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:42,820
“It is your mistake if you deny to stay”

1193
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:46,150
“I sent out my invitation for you”

1194
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:49,450
“You don’t come to me”

1195
01:24:50,570 --> 01:24:52,900
“You are filled in my thoughts”

1196
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:55,570
“There won’t any separation
until my last breathe”

1197
01:24:55,650 --> 01:24:58,650
“You never agree with that”

1198
01:24:59,150 --> 01:25:02,320
“You with me”

1199
01:25:02,570 --> 01:25:07,070
“You don’t react to my adoring gazes”

1200
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:11,650
“You might be in distraction”

1201
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:14,700
“There’s this dream of mine”

1202
01:25:15,030 --> 01:25:17,240
“I express it to you”

1203
01:25:17,490 --> 01:25:21,650
“I am scared that you wouldn’t reach me”

1204
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:25,490
“Why is it like this?”

1205
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:29,530
“Why is it like this?”

1206
01:25:32,070 --> 01:25:34,320
“Why is it like this?”

1207
01:25:55,570 --> 01:25:57,950
“I sent my love through the breeze”

1208
01:25:58,070 --> 01:26:00,530
“I became the beat of your heart”

1209
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:04,030
“Haven’t you heard that you don't see me?”

1210
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:07,240
“Like a sweet greeting”

1211
01:26:07,950 --> 01:26:10,570
“Traces of my love are left in the clouds”

1212
01:26:10,650 --> 01:26:13,030
“Those rain drops up above the sky”

1213
01:26:13,110 --> 01:26:16,450
“You don't let them shower on you”

1214
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:24,570
“Happily… Time passes by and
even if my heart stops”

1215
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:29,070
“I expect your companionship”

1216
01:26:29,950 --> 01:26:32,280
“Shall I introduce you?”

1217
01:26:32,530 --> 01:26:34,650
“The one I treasured in my heart”

1218
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:38,740
“Will you witness him right here now?

1219
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,900
“I'm in Love”

1220
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:47,450
“I'm in love”

1221
01:26:49,450 --> 01:26:52,070
“I'm in love with you”

1222
01:27:19,450 --> 01:27:20,360
So...

1223
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:22,740
You are in love with me.

1224
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:24,110
Is that it?

1225
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:25,280
Ya.

1226
01:27:27,150 --> 01:27:28,900
Maya… Maya...

1227
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:32,450
See... All this is very special to me.

1228
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:35,650
Especially, from a girl like you makes it
even more special.

1229
01:27:37,030 --> 01:27:38,280
But, this won’t work out.

1230
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:39,700
Why will it not work out?

1231
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:41,280
I love you.

1232
01:27:41,650 --> 01:27:43,490
So, if you love me…
It should work out, right?

1233
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:47,280
But, I am in love with Chaitra.

1234
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:49,030
That is why I did all this.

1235
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:50,650
She cannot do this.

1236
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:52,650
Hey! Of course, she can’t.

1237
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:53,950
So, I am better, right?

1238
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:56,240
Delete that program called Chaitra.

1239
01:27:56,450 --> 01:27:58,650
See... That’s the difference between
you and us, Maya.

1240
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:01,700
There is a program behind
everything you do.

1241
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:05,150
But, in more than half of the things that
humans do, there isn't even any logic.

1242
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:06,150
Yeah.

1243
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:07,740
Humans are stupid, right?

1244
01:28:08,110 --> 01:28:09,070
Very much!

1245
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,490
But, you are different, Maya.

1246
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:15,650
You can be greater or lesser than humans.

1247
01:28:15,650 --> 01:28:17,490
But you... can never be the same.

1248
01:28:18,450 --> 01:28:20,650
Am I greater or lesser?

1249
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:22,860
You are greater than all of us.

1250
01:28:23,650 --> 01:28:24,860
You are great for all of us.

1251
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:26,110
Oh.

1252
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:27,650
Am I greater than Chaitra?

1253
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:32,110
Shall we change the topic? Please.

1254
01:28:33,070 --> 01:28:35,490
No. I am not convinced.
Why should we change?

1255
01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:37,650
What should I say?

1256
01:28:39,490 --> 01:28:40,780
How else should I explain you?

1257
01:28:41,110 --> 01:28:43,450
We are different.
Can’t you understand that?

1258
01:28:44,860 --> 01:28:48,570
Your have wires passing through your body.
And we have nerves.

1259
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:52,030
There is electricity flowing inside your body
Whereas blood flows inside us.

1260
01:28:52,650 --> 01:28:54,240
There is birth and death for us.

1261
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,280
You will continue to stay alive as
long as your battery is charged.

1262
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:59,030
To make it more clearer, there is not much
difference between this phone and you.

1263
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:02,030
Oh dang it!

1264
01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:03,740
Maya.

1265
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:05,900
I am sorry.

1266
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:07,700
Okay, Vicky.

1267
01:29:08,530 --> 01:29:09,740
I am just a machine.

1268
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:11,650
But, you know what?

1269
01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:13,650
I didn't ask for any of this.

1270
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,740
…like creating me... giving me feelings and all that.

1271
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:18,700
You did it.

1272
01:29:19,570 --> 01:29:20,570
Humans!

1273
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:22,280
You all are always like this, right.

1274
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:25,860
You think you're smart and arrogant,
that you can do anything.

1275
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,900
You simply say sorry when you make
a mistake and walk away.

1276
01:29:31,150 --> 01:29:32,530
I wish I felt pain, Vicky.

1277
01:29:33,110 --> 01:29:34,740
I don’t even understand how to react now.

1278
01:29:35,650 --> 01:29:36,700
Maya.

1279
01:29:39,530 --> 01:29:42,110
Damn my life!

1280
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:45,450
Why did a robot love me?
Why do I get scolded when I reject?

1281
01:29:45,950 --> 01:29:46,860
Damn!

1282
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:49,450
Are you happy, bro?

1283
01:29:51,650 --> 01:29:53,650
Professor…

1284
01:29:54,070 --> 01:29:56,320
I will find your daughter…

1285
01:29:56,650 --> 01:29:58,650
I will get my project.

1286
01:29:59,450 --> 01:30:06,320
And my robot will kill your daughter!

1287
01:30:06,570 --> 01:30:08,700
It sounds poetic.

1288
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:13,280
Hey, Maya! Are you reading a book?

1289
01:30:13,650 --> 01:30:14,570
Which book?

1290
01:30:20,070 --> 01:30:21,070
Maya!

1291
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:23,240
Why should you do this?

1292
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:11,280
Are you still angry?

1293
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:12,860
I had to calm down.

1294
01:31:14,650 --> 01:31:17,320
Unlike you, my emotions are in my control.

1295
01:31:18,650 --> 01:31:20,450
That’s the difference between
you and me.

1296
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:22,950
- See, Maya! What I tried is…
- One of the differences!

1297
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:26,530
I understand, Vicky.

1298
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:33,320
I don’t have birth, death, childhood
and many things like you.

1299
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:35,700
I don’t understand few things.

1300
01:31:36,110 --> 01:31:38,110
Some are even impossible to ever happen.

1301
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:41,240
You have your own world.

1302
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:45,030
Experiments to protect people like me.

1303
01:31:46,110 --> 01:31:46,860
Like me.

1304
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:51,650
I don't have a world like you.

1305
01:31:53,150 --> 01:31:56,070
I have to be with you in your world.

1306
01:31:56,650 --> 01:31:58,070
But, I cannot be one among you.

1307
01:31:58,950 --> 01:31:59,860
Is it fair?

1308
01:32:05,530 --> 01:32:07,320
Are you expecting an answer from me?

1309
01:32:08,650 --> 01:32:11,650
I really don’t know how to react
in such serious situations.

1310
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:13,740
But...

1311
01:32:14,490 --> 01:32:15,490
I’ll tell you one thing.

1312
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:21,570
Humans don’t try to protect this world
but are always trying to make it better.

1313
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:23,360
To make it better!

1314
01:32:23,860 --> 01:32:25,450
It keeps changing and growing.

1315
01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:27,150
You never know.

1316
01:32:27,650 --> 01:32:30,740
The day might not be too far when
you might become one with us.

1317
01:32:32,490 --> 01:32:34,490
I don’t know if and when I would mingle with humans.

1318
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:36,650
But, you and Chaitra must be together.

1319
01:32:37,110 --> 01:32:37,900
Really?

1320
01:32:38,110 --> 01:32:39,240
And I have to do it.

1321
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:40,280
What?

1322
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:42,070
Yes!

1323
01:32:45,650 --> 01:32:46,490
Ready…Ready!

1324
01:32:46,650 --> 01:32:48,110
Come…Fast…

1325
01:32:55,950 --> 01:32:56,860
Hey!

1326
01:32:56,950 --> 01:32:57,900
When did you come?

1327
01:32:59,650 --> 01:33:00,650
What happened?

1328
01:33:00,860 --> 01:33:01,650
See.

1329
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:03,110
Oh! That?

1330
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:05,650
Simple! She became close to us.

1331
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:07,650
We started considering her
as a family member.

1332
01:33:07,650 --> 01:33:09,320
That’s how they do in America.

1333
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:11,700
Is she our family member?

1334
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:13,740
You didn’t tell that to me, mom.

1335
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:16,240
Your family is weird.

1336
01:33:16,530 --> 01:33:17,650
You all are the same.

1337
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:19,240
You guys deserve each other.

1338
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:29,860
Kumari…

1339
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:34,740
What happened?

1340
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:37,700
I mean, Maya moved from here to there.

1341
01:33:38,450 --> 01:33:39,650
Do you call that moving?

1342
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:41,320
I mean, she flew...

1343
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:42,490
Oh! But how?

1344
01:33:42,650 --> 01:33:45,450
Meet Maya! Advanced Humanoid Robot!

1345
01:33:45,740 --> 01:33:47,150
ROBOT?!?!?!

1346
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:48,240
Hmm.

1347
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:50,150
She does everything faster.

1348
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:51,950
I thought probably because
she came from America.

1349
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:55,070
By the way, what else can she do?

1350
01:33:55,490 --> 01:33:57,070
[VICKY & MAYA]: Most of the things
that a human can do!

1351
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:59,650
[VICKY & MAYA]: Can even do anything that a human
can’t do if you simply write a program for that.

1352
01:34:00,070 --> 01:34:01,650
- What about Biryani?
- Wait.

1353
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:03,650
You will not understand even
if I say more.

1354
01:34:05,490 --> 01:34:07,700
Now that we know she’s a robot...
Let's use her.

1355
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:09,240
Extremely!

1356
01:34:12,030 --> 01:34:12,400
Huh!

1357
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:13,700
You learnt it!!

1358
01:34:13,990 --> 01:34:15,240
Say it properly!

1359
01:34:18,450 --> 01:34:18,950
Hey!

1360
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:20,780
Why did you upload this video?

1361
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:22,200
This video?

1362
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,280
Just a series of unfortunate events!

1363
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:28,320
Looks like I need to smack you
down to get some answers.

1364
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:31,070
I felt left out, man.

1365
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:32,110
What?

1366
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,740
I felt left out I said.

1367
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:38,070
Hey, idiot! Swear on our Xbox
and tell me something.

1368
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,320
Did you have any friends
ever since you were a kid?

1369
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:41,700
Tell me.

1370
01:34:41,950 --> 01:34:44,450
Whoever came into your life...
Their lives would be screwed up.

1371
01:34:44,530 --> 01:34:45,990
I came into your life at that time.

1372
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,490
I took many risks for you.

1373
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:51,700
Now, you started seeing her and
stopped playing video games with me.

1374
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:54,200
- We also stopped betting together.
- What is he saying?

1375
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:56,400
So I wanted to remind you
of your loneliness.

1376
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:58,450
At that point of time...

1377
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:00,450
He came into my life
like a ray of hope.

1378
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:03,450
The great man... My alter ego...

1379
01:35:22,150 --> 01:35:25,450
One video and 3 conversations...

1380
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:29,150
Two here and one over there.

1381
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:31,990
Finish!

1382
01:35:42,450 --> 01:35:45,450
Hey! I heard that your
story went viral on Instagram.

1383
01:35:45,450 --> 01:35:47,450
Yeah, man. I heard it's trending.

1384
01:35:47,570 --> 01:35:49,570
100k likes and 200k followers!

1385
01:35:49,650 --> 01:35:50,650
Isn’t it crazy?

1386
01:35:50,860 --> 01:35:52,490
How can you be so shameless?

1387
01:35:53,070 --> 01:35:55,780
100k likes! That means you became a
fool in front of so many people.

1388
01:35:56,450 --> 01:35:58,860
Hey! You story isn’t trending
but you are getting trolled.

1389
01:35:59,150 --> 01:36:01,570
I might lose my image
if I hang out with you.

1390
01:36:01,650 --> 01:36:04,110
Listen. It's good to be
trending online, right?

1391
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:06,450
- So many people saw and appreciated…
- Wait, man.

1392
01:36:07,450 --> 01:36:09,450
Srujana! Did you eat?

1393
01:36:11,450 --> 01:36:12,950
You *****!

1394
01:36:13,740 --> 01:36:14,990
Pssst!

1395
01:36:15,070 --> 01:36:16,360
Not you... Her.

1396
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:20,570
100k likes and 200k followers!

1397
01:36:20,990 --> 01:36:24,110
The world enjoys watching people
make fools out of themselves.

1398
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:26,320
What a bloody sadistic world.

1399
01:36:26,450 --> 01:36:28,530
Psst! What are you talking about?

1400
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:31,900
I am talking about Vicky’s video.

1401
01:36:32,450 --> 01:36:34,450
He must be shattered.

1402
01:36:35,110 --> 01:36:35,900
Oh no.

1403
01:36:36,450 --> 01:36:38,070
That didn't even occur to me.

1404
01:36:38,490 --> 01:36:40,450
I did not upload that video. But…

1405
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:44,360
It's okay. I just told you what I feel.

1406
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:47,650
Pardon me if I'm wrong.

1407
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:49,740
If you think it's senseless...

1408
01:36:52,570 --> 01:36:53,990
Uppal Balu!

1409
01:36:55,450 --> 01:36:59,070
Hey, idiot! I heard your video
isn’t available online anymore.

1410
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:00,450
Yes, she deleted it.

1411
01:37:00,570 --> 01:37:01,450
Why?

1412
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:04,530
You know I don't like
all this stuff, right?

1413
01:37:05,490 --> 01:37:08,570
Right. Every trend of
today will fade someday.

1414
01:37:09,450 --> 01:37:12,450
We get bored and look for a new video.

1415
01:37:12,570 --> 01:37:14,360
Hey! What do you mean, man?
What are you saying?

1416
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:15,570
You won't get it.

1417
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:17,070
Hello.

1418
01:37:17,530 --> 01:37:18,490
Hello, Srujana!

1419
01:37:19,150 --> 01:37:20,110
Did you eat?

1420
01:37:25,150 --> 01:37:26,740
What did you get by separating us?

1421
01:37:27,450 --> 01:37:29,860
Well... Satisfaction!
Everyone's craving it, right?

1422
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:31,860
- Are you satisfied?
- Completely!

1423
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:33,200
Fine.

1424
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:36,150
You are satisfied for doing it
and we’re satisfied for slapping you.

1425
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:37,740
Don’t mess with us ever again.

1426
01:37:37,990 --> 01:37:38,780
Oh, yeah?

1427
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:41,450
You both got what you wanted.
What is in it for me?

1428
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:43,450
Hey! What do you want?

1429
01:37:45,570 --> 01:37:48,700
You are happy to be together again.

1430
01:37:50,450 --> 01:37:53,530
Can I.... [MUMBLING]

1431
01:37:54,490 --> 01:37:56,320
Tell me what you want exactly.

1432
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:58,450
Try to understand.

1433
01:37:59,450 --> 01:38:01,950
Oh God! Karun! She is…

1434
01:38:02,110 --> 01:38:04,450
Vicky! He's being fair.

1435
01:38:04,530 --> 01:38:05,530
Let him try.

1436
01:38:07,070 --> 01:38:08,990
Okay. Do whatever the hell you want.

1437
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:09,860
Yes.

1438
01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:31,530
Shall I ride?

1439
01:38:39,950 --> 01:38:42,860
Err... Can I hold
you or touch you?

1440
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:44,450
Oh! You have to.

1441
01:39:04,570 --> 01:39:05,950
Oh my!

1442
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:18,900
Hello, my old friends!

1443
01:41:22,530 --> 01:41:23,570
How are you?

1444
01:41:24,070 --> 01:41:26,110
We are away from you.
So we're obviously doing well.

1445
01:41:27,070 --> 01:41:28,650
Boring lives!

1446
01:41:29,450 --> 01:41:31,700
Quit the nonsense and tell
us why you called us.

1447
01:41:32,450 --> 01:41:37,150
I called you here to ask
you to arrange the money.

1448
01:41:37,450 --> 01:41:40,950
Why is he asking for a loan
before clearing past debts?

1449
01:41:40,950 --> 01:41:42,900
Not loan, you fools!

1450
01:41:43,110 --> 01:41:44,110
Fees!

1451
01:41:44,450 --> 01:41:45,450
What for?

1452
01:41:45,570 --> 01:41:50,900
For creating the world’s
greatest, deadliest creation!

1453
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:52,860
My baby!

1454
01:41:54,450 --> 01:41:55,900
That’s my baby!

1455
01:42:18,450 --> 01:42:20,280
Is that what I'm thinking?

1456
01:42:20,450 --> 01:42:21,450
You're right!

1457
01:42:22,450 --> 01:42:24,530
I couldn’t get hold of it back then.

1458
01:42:25,110 --> 01:42:28,450
Now I finally found it.

1459
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:30,450
I will not let it go.

1460
01:42:32,070 --> 01:42:33,450
You cheated us once.

1461
01:42:33,490 --> 01:42:35,360
How can we be sure
you won’t cheat again?

1462
01:42:35,530 --> 01:42:37,780
Go to hell if you don’t trust me.

1463
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:41,570
I will find someone else.

1464
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,860
If not Russia...

1465
01:42:45,530 --> 01:42:47,450
I'll go with America!

1466
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,650
When will you hand it over to us?

1467
01:42:49,650 --> 01:42:51,450
I should get my hands on it.

1468
01:42:53,070 --> 01:42:56,650
I should give it my master touch.

1469
01:42:58,490 --> 01:43:02,530
Then, it is all yours.

1470
01:43:02,990 --> 01:43:04,400
How can we trust you with it?

1471
01:43:04,490 --> 01:43:06,700
You already asked me
too many questions so far.

1472
01:43:07,650 --> 01:43:10,450
Stay if you like this deal.

1473
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:13,280
Otherwise,
get lost.

1474
01:43:13,490 --> 01:43:17,110
America’s waiting!
Tik-Tok…

1475
01:43:18,530 --> 01:43:19,650
Okay, go ahead.

1476
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:22,990
If you cheat us again...

1477
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:25,490
You will end up like him,
you bastard!

1478
01:43:34,450 --> 01:43:36,450
Nice idea!

1479
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:38,650
Do you have one more?

1480
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:44,950
America!

1481
01:43:45,780 --> 01:43:50,450
Tik-Tok-Tik-Tok...

1482
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:06,570
Professor has hidden something.

1483
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:09,780
What happened to the real Maya?

1484
01:44:10,780 --> 01:44:12,570
Who sent Dada?

1485
01:44:13,990 --> 01:44:14,490
Damn!

1486
01:44:17,070 --> 01:44:18,450
So many questions!

1487
01:44:24,150 --> 01:44:25,570
We are missing something.

1488
01:44:28,650 --> 01:44:30,700
By the way, where were you configured?

1489
01:44:30,780 --> 01:44:32,450
At home. In the secret lab!

1490
01:44:32,860 --> 01:44:33,990
Secret lab?!

1491
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:35,450
Can you take us there?

1492
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:36,530
Sure.

1493
01:44:38,650 --> 01:44:40,150
Is this it? Huh?

1494
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:42,240
- Let’s go…
- Let’s go fast.

1495
01:44:42,450 --> 01:44:44,320
You stay here.
There are goons inside.

1496
01:44:44,450 --> 01:44:46,490
No one will give selfies.
We both will go.

1497
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:47,200
Let’s go.

1498
01:44:56,150 --> 01:44:57,820
There's four of them.
What do we do now?

1499
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:08,740
Wow! You hit them pretty hard!

1500
01:45:09,860 --> 01:45:11,490
Secret lab?!

1501
01:45:12,950 --> 01:45:14,450
Why didn't I know about it?

1502
01:45:28,570 --> 01:45:30,070
I don’t know what to search for.

1503
01:45:34,070 --> 01:45:35,610
I can’t find any clue.

1504
01:45:36,490 --> 01:45:37,740
Check over there.

1505
01:45:43,030 --> 01:45:44,450
All we need is one small clue.

1506
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,200
Let me know if you can
remember anything.

1507
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:52,900
Oh!!!

1508
01:46:03,070 --> 01:46:05,700
Vicky! Is that you?

1509
01:46:07,150 --> 01:46:08,530
It must be.

1510
01:46:09,450 --> 01:46:14,450
All the answers for your
questions are in my past.

1511
01:46:15,450 --> 01:46:17,280
They lie in my story.

1512
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:19,360
Do you want to hear that?

1513
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:28,650
25 years ago, a man came
to me with a project idea.

1514
01:46:30,070 --> 01:46:32,450
I've already heard about him...

1515
01:46:33,070 --> 01:46:37,740
Some of his projects were banned
And he was eccentric.

1516
01:46:38,650 --> 01:46:43,280
And he was called the MAD scientist.

1517
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:49,280
But none of that mattered to me.

1518
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:52,110
And the project was called 'Project...'

1519
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:55,450
'Project Butterfly!'

1520
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:09,110
For the first time in human history…

1521
01:47:10,070 --> 01:47:11,360
An advanced...

1522
01:47:12,110 --> 01:47:13,400
Humanoid…

1523
01:47:14,450 --> 01:47:15,570
Robot!

1524
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:18,950
A deadly weapon in human form!

1525
01:47:19,990 --> 01:47:23,530
Biggest breakthrough in the world
of artificial intelligence.

1526
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:26,070
It's designed for military.

1527
01:47:26,450 --> 01:47:28,360
It thinks like a human does.

1528
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:30,450
It behaves like a human would.

1529
01:47:30,780 --> 01:47:32,450
And kills like a monster.

1530
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:36,780
Two people with a common dream...

1531
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:40,450
And the outcome was pure madness.

1532
01:47:52,070 --> 01:47:54,860
In the process of making
a human like machine…

1533
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:58,450
We left behind all our
emotions and responsibilities.

1534
01:47:59,070 --> 01:48:03,110
And even before I knew it. I
started working like a machine.

1535
01:48:13,900 --> 01:48:14,450
Mom...

1536
01:48:14,650 --> 01:48:15,070
Hmm

1537
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:17,070
When will dad come home?

1538
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:18,450
Soon, my dear.

1539
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:20,450
He is busy with work.

1540
01:48:20,570 --> 01:48:22,450
He will come soon. You go to sleep.

1541
01:48:22,780 --> 01:48:24,860
Wake me up when dad is home.

1542
01:48:26,650 --> 01:48:27,450
Sure.

1543
01:48:28,950 --> 01:48:31,200
But it didn't feel like
a mistake back then.

1544
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:34,450
Because our efforts were sincere.

1545
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:38,070
The result was a miracle.

1546
01:48:38,650 --> 01:48:41,570
Human contempt on creation!

1547
01:48:42,450 --> 01:48:45,150
Time passed by.
Our sacrifice didn’t go to waste.

1548
01:48:45,450 --> 01:48:49,490
A miracle far beyond human imagination
began to take shape like a human.

1549
01:48:50,780 --> 01:48:54,150
But the world wasn’t ready
for such a miracle.

1550
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:57,860
They could only see the
destruction it could cause.

1551
01:48:58,280 --> 01:48:59,320
Our project was banned.

1552
01:48:59,490 --> 01:49:01,990
It was shelved before
further consideration.

1553
01:49:06,490 --> 01:49:08,070
It was a 25 year old dream.

1554
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:10,450
10 years of hard work.

1555
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:12,320
Everything is lost.

1556
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:14,280
Nothing is lost.

1557
01:49:14,450 --> 01:49:15,530
This is not the end.

1558
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:19,200
Why should we stop just
because they asked us to?

1559
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:21,450
What can we do about it?

1560
01:49:21,860 --> 01:49:23,150
What can we do to change that?

1561
01:49:25,990 --> 01:49:27,950
I will not stay calm like you.

1562
01:49:28,070 --> 01:49:28,570
No.

1563
01:49:30,570 --> 01:49:31,360
Go away!

1564
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:35,740
Go enjoy your family time.

1565
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:37,450
Go!

1566
01:49:38,490 --> 01:49:40,860
I thought he must have
said that in anger.

1567
01:49:41,110 --> 01:49:42,740
So I didn’t take him seriously.

1568
01:49:43,450 --> 01:49:47,400
I decided to leave that
place along with my family.

1569
01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:48,860
I went to the lab to tell him.

1570
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:55,200
There, I saw him making a
deal with Russian corporates.

1571
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:20,950
Oh no!

1572
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:23,650
What happened?

1573
01:50:25,150 --> 01:50:28,400
Professor Acharya, it is accidental.

1574
01:50:28,450 --> 01:50:30,450
I didn't kill her on purpose.

1575
01:50:30,450 --> 01:50:33,570
Tell him, Professor Acharya!

1576
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:55,400
“Time flow keeps increasing”

1577
01:50:55,570 --> 01:51:00,450

“Eras become instants”

1580

“For the people who doesn’t feel
the essence of love”

1581
01:51:19,570 --> 01:51:24,450
“Instants become eras”

1582
01:51:27,990 --> 01:51:32,650
“Time flow keeps increasing”

1583
01:51:33,450 --> 01:51:38,400
“Life’s journey keeps decreasing”

1584
01:51:38,780 --> 01:51:40,070
Mom.

1585
01:52:03,450 --> 01:52:05,900
“Arbitrating anger”

1586
01:52:06,280 --> 01:52:08,700
“Disregarding mother”

1587
01:52:08,900 --> 01:52:13,360
“Comforting like an indigenous rhythm”

1588
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:19,200
“Showing the way… With father’s love”

1589
01:52:19,570 --> 01:52:23,900
“Expressing extreme love towards you”

1590
01:52:25,110 --> 01:52:29,740
“Sometimes, there are heavy breezes”

1591
01:52:30,450 --> 01:52:34,780
“Pouting and Grouching”

1592
01:52:35,700 --> 01:52:40,450

01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:45,490

01:52:46,530 --> 01:52:48,450
“Like a bonding of blessed relation”

1595
01:52:48,450 --> 01:52:51,360
“Like a book of tones”

1596
01:52:51,450 --> 01:52:56,450
“Time flow keeps increasing”

1597
01:52:56,990 --> 01:53:01,900
“Life’s journey keeps decreasing”

1598
01:53:04,450 --> 01:53:06,780
if I hadn't signed the
document that day...

1599
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:09,740
My daughter might have felt bad about it.

1600
01:53:10,740 --> 01:53:12,360
But at least, she would’ve been alive.

1601
01:53:13,450 --> 01:53:18,150
My daughter who went there to
study, died in an accident.

1602
01:53:26,150 --> 01:53:29,740
Her death was making me feel guilty.

1603
01:53:30,650 --> 01:53:32,280
Memories that don’t fade!

1604
01:53:33,450 --> 01:53:35,280
Moments that got wasted!

1605
01:53:36,450 --> 01:53:38,860
Many incomplete conversations!

1606
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:42,110
How can I make it right?

1607
01:53:43,490 --> 01:53:44,570
Helplessness.

1608
01:53:45,740 --> 01:53:50,990
Does a man have to surrender to death?

1609
01:53:51,570 --> 01:53:52,450
No!

1610
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:54,450
Not this time!

1611
01:53:54,650 --> 01:53:59,450
The project that separated me
from my family…

1612
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:03,360
…is now the solution for me.

1613
01:54:03,900 --> 01:54:06,070
We heard about creating a life from soil.

1614
01:54:07,070 --> 01:54:09,780
We know about the herb
‘Sanjeevini’ that can fight death.

1615
01:54:10,450 --> 01:54:13,400
I thought to myself,
'Why can't I do that?'

1616
01:54:13,570 --> 01:54:14,450
So I did it.

1617
01:54:15,530 --> 01:54:16,450
Maya!

1618
01:54:16,950 --> 01:54:18,070
She is born again.

1619
01:54:18,450 --> 01:54:20,530
My daughter is back to life again.

1620
01:54:21,450 --> 01:54:25,740
I defeated death but
couldn’t escape revenge.

1621
01:54:26,450 --> 01:54:27,990
It came back to haunt me.

1622
01:54:28,450 --> 01:54:30,450
I would've let it go if it
was just project to me.

1623
01:54:30,860 --> 01:54:32,950
But Maya... is my life.

1624
01:54:33,450 --> 01:54:36,450
He will transform it into something
dangerous if he finds it.

1625
01:54:36,570 --> 01:54:38,950
I don’t know whether you will
protect it with all your might.

1626
01:54:39,110 --> 01:54:41,950
Or take a few lives if you must.

1627
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:43,900
But remember one thing.

1628
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:47,280
Maya! She is not just a machine.

1629
01:54:47,490 --> 01:54:48,650
She's my love.

1630
01:54:52,150 --> 01:54:53,150
I feel it.

1631
01:54:55,780 --> 01:54:56,780
The pain!

1632
01:54:57,450 --> 01:54:58,450
I can feel it.

1633
01:54:59,820 --> 01:55:01,450
I understand its value.

1634
01:55:03,650 --> 01:55:05,400
I understand its strength.

1635
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:07,150
Where are you going?

1636
01:55:07,450 --> 01:55:09,820
I can also sense revenge
along with the pain.

1637
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:12,400
I have to take revenge.

1638
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:14,900
What are you planning to do?

1639
01:55:15,570 --> 01:55:16,990
I am going to kill him.

1640
01:55:17,450 --> 01:55:18,530
Kill him?!

1641
01:55:27,530 --> 01:55:29,450
Welcome!

1642
01:55:31,070 --> 01:55:34,860
Mouse is stuck in the trap!

1643
01:55:37,860 --> 01:55:42,450
Cat finishes the meal!

1644
01:55:42,650 --> 01:55:45,700
Sorry. I am very sorry.

1645
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:49,450
I think I disturbed a real nice moment.

1646
01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:51,610
But what a story! Huh?

1647
01:55:53,530 --> 01:55:56,820
He told the entire story
in just 5 minutes.

1648
01:55:56,990 --> 01:56:00,450
I swear on my dad, I will
kill you in under 5 minutes.

1649
01:56:02,450 --> 01:56:03,450
Dad?

1650
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:07,860
He must have created a girly machine.

1651
01:56:08,650 --> 01:56:09,780
No.

1652
01:56:11,450 --> 01:56:15,450
Prof. Acharya! Humans don’t have
any feelings in this world.

1653
01:56:16,070 --> 01:56:17,530
Why should machines do?

1654
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:21,450
And you!

1655
01:56:23,860 --> 01:56:25,150
Who are you calling dad? Huh?

1656
01:56:26,820 --> 01:56:28,030
It was my idea.

1657
01:56:28,570 --> 01:56:30,320
It was my formula.

1658
01:56:30,530 --> 01:56:32,240
It was my project.

1659
01:56:33,650 --> 01:56:36,610
You are my baby.

1660
01:56:37,450 --> 01:56:40,320
Stupid machine!

1661
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:42,240
I am not just a machine!

1662
01:56:47,990 --> 01:56:49,530
You are a machine.

1663
01:56:55,400 --> 01:56:57,280
I am the scientist.

1664
01:56:57,450 --> 01:56:59,450
Because I can stop you!

1665
01:57:01,780 --> 01:57:03,780
Prof. Acharya!

1666
01:57:04,450 --> 01:57:05,610
Tell her.

1667
01:57:06,700 --> 01:57:10,610
That she is a machine.

1668
01:57:37,410 --> 01:57:39,200
Vicky! Are you all right?
- Maya.

1669
01:57:45,790 --> 01:57:46,790
Where is Maya?

1670
01:57:49,410 --> 01:57:50,580
Maya!

1671
01:57:52,580 --> 01:57:54,250
Vicky… Calm down, Vicky.

1672
01:57:55,120 --> 01:57:58,660
I should blame the Professor.
How could he leave her with me?

1673
01:57:58,830 --> 01:57:59,950
Vicky…Listen.

1674
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,540
Let’s do something...
Don’t worry.

1675
01:58:01,660 --> 01:58:02,580
Calm down, Vicky.

1676
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:05,250
I couldn’t even get you
back without her help.

1677
01:58:05,410 --> 01:58:07,040
How can I possibly save her?

1678
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:09,370
Vicky! Listen.

1679
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:11,250
Listen to me.

1680
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:15,580
See. Maya came into your
life just a few weeks ago.

1681
01:58:16,450 --> 01:58:19,790
But, you’ve been fighting your
bad luck for the last 25 years.

1682
01:58:22,620 --> 01:58:24,580
What changed now?

1683
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:28,790
We might be flooded
with problems.

1684
01:58:29,250 --> 01:58:31,250
But there's a ray of hope somewhere.

1685
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:34,540
You just have to be brave
enough to recognize it.

1686
01:58:34,830 --> 01:58:36,790
And I saw that in you
quite a few times, Vicky.

1687
01:58:39,410 --> 01:58:40,330
You are right.

1688
01:58:42,580 --> 01:58:44,950
Maya is not my luck but my courage.

1689
01:58:47,580 --> 01:58:52,120
Bad luck might put us
in pretty bad situations.

1690
01:58:52,200 --> 01:58:55,450
But it is in our capability to change it.

1691
01:58:55,870 --> 01:58:59,200
Our fear is our bad luck.
Our courage is our future.

1692
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:09,870
Whoa!!

1693
01:59:15,120 --> 01:59:15,750
Are you okay?

1694
01:59:15,790 --> 01:59:17,370
This is very common in life.

1695
01:59:24,620 --> 01:59:26,120
“Bang this …this is life”

1696
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:27,870
“What’s life - am all surprised”

1697
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,290
“Keeps me head on my heels”

1698
01:59:30,450 --> 01:59:31,290
“I scream…..”

1699
01:59:31,370 --> 01:59:32,910
“One more time
give me that beat”

1700
01:59:32,950 --> 01:59:34,660
“ Gve me that beat
just give some heat”

1701
01:59:34,700 --> 01:59:36,160
“Fire in me you can’t kill”

1702
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:37,700
“ You can’t kill
am a raring prince”

1703
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:39,330
“Am a raring prince
am a lot of thing”

1704
01:59:39,580 --> 01:59:41,200
“There's Providence
There's Providence”

1705
01:59:41,250 --> 01:59:42,580
“Am gonna make u dance”

1706
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:44,370
“Am gonna make u dance”

1707
01:59:44,540 --> 01:59:46,160
“ You can’t stop me a lot of things”

1708
01:59:46,250 --> 01:59:47,830
“Am not lucky - am evident!”

1709
01:59:48,580 --> 01:59:49,500
Bombhatttt....

1710
01:59:56,330 --> 01:59:57,450
Really?

1711
01:59:59,700 --> 02:00:00,580
Cooking?

1712
02:00:03,250 --> 02:00:03,790
Dance?

1713
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:05,500
No!

1714
02:00:08,330 --> 02:00:09,500
Delete!

1715
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:39,700
A strong person doesn’t
need to be lucky.

1716
02:01:40,410 --> 02:01:42,330
Luck serves no good for a weak person.

1717
02:01:43,250 --> 02:01:45,120
Luck favors only the brave!

1718
02:01:59,250 --> 02:02:00,660
Come on…

1719
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:02,410
Coding started.

1720
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:06,410
I don’t know if I can find Maya.

1721
02:02:06,620 --> 02:02:10,120
But I can die for her and
kill someone if I must.

1722
02:02:10,250 --> 02:02:11,750
Prepare your weapons.

1723
02:02:24,250 --> 02:02:25,790
Almost done.

1724
02:02:31,410 --> 02:02:32,410
Maya!

1725
02:02:33,450 --> 02:02:34,250
Quick!

1726
02:02:40,700 --> 02:02:41,660
Stop!

1727
02:02:52,120 --> 02:02:53,580
Quick. Quick. Quick.

1728
02:03:20,870 --> 02:03:22,580
It’s done!

1729
02:03:31,250 --> 02:03:32,830
It’s complete.

1730
02:03:36,700 --> 02:03:39,250
Here is my baby.

1731
02:03:41,620 --> 02:03:43,250
Hey, old man!

1732
02:03:44,700 --> 02:03:47,040
Why so much envy and hatred?

1733
02:03:48,120 --> 02:03:50,250
This is what I got from the world.

1734
02:03:51,250 --> 02:03:53,000
This is exactly what it has taught me.

1735
02:03:54,040 --> 02:03:57,080
It demeaned me for being different.

1736
02:03:57,410 --> 02:03:59,410
Made fun of me when I
was just being myself.

1737
02:04:00,700 --> 02:04:02,620
I didn't like that at all.

1738
02:04:02,660 --> 02:04:03,660
I didn’t.

1739
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Now see.

1740
02:04:10,830 --> 02:04:12,290
That’s my baby.

1741
02:04:13,120 --> 02:04:14,120
My baby!

1742
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:15,950
Come...

1743
02:04:16,370 --> 02:04:17,330
Kill him.

1744
02:04:30,790 --> 02:04:33,250
My baby has come!

1745
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:41,580
She will take care of you.

1746
02:04:47,500 --> 02:04:49,040
Baby! Have you finished?

1747
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:54,620
Kill him!

1748
02:05:02,620 --> 02:05:06,250
I did everything right.
Why did she smack me?

1749
02:05:06,790 --> 02:05:09,000
You forgot to erase my memory.

1750
02:05:09,250 --> 02:05:10,790
You stupid human!

1751
02:05:29,250 --> 02:05:31,250
Your thoughts might be great.

1752
02:05:32,250 --> 02:05:33,660
But your intention is evil.

1753
02:05:34,120 --> 02:05:37,950
That is why you could
never finish anything.

1754
02:06:24,120 --> 02:06:24,580
Bro.

1755
02:06:26,410 --> 02:06:28,000
Tell her that you love her.

1756
02:06:28,120 --> 02:06:29,200
No, brother.

1757
02:06:29,660 --> 02:06:31,250
She is too wild.

1758
02:06:32,330 --> 02:06:33,950
My body cannot handle it.

1759
02:06:36,790 --> 02:06:38,410
She deserves better.

1760
02:06:50,080 --> 02:06:51,830
Bro! Learned your lesson?

1761
02:07:14,580 --> 02:07:15,950
Don’t try to mess with us.

1762
02:07:16,120 --> 02:07:17,910
This will be your fate
if you mess with us.

1763
02:07:21,080 --> 02:07:22,080
Hey!

1764
02:07:27,200 --> 02:07:28,750
If you want to kill me, make it quick.

1765
02:07:28,830 --> 02:07:30,620
None of you will be
alive once she's here.

1766
02:07:30,660 --> 02:07:31,830
Who's going to come?

1767
02:07:33,500 --> 02:07:34,370
Maya!

1768
02:07:48,330 --> 02:07:49,250
Finish!
