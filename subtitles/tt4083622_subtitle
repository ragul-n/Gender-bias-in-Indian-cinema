00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,541
<font color="#00ffff">-Give that girl some food.
-Okay, boss.</font>

6
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:59,083
<font color="#00ffff">You don't worry. Stay at the booth.
My people will come there soon.</font>

7
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,791

10
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:31,625
<font color="#00ffff">You bastards.
What the hell were you doing?</font>

11
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,791
<font color="#00ffff">-Go, go and search.
-Okay, boss. Come, let's go.</font>

12
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,708
<font color="#00ffff">I want that girl here by tomorrow morning.</font>

13
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,375
<font color="#00ffff">Sir... Sir...</font>

14
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:06,375
<font color="#00ffff">I was the one who called the control room.</font>

15
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,416
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, I see, okay, what happened?</font>

16
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:14,458
<font color="#00ffff">Sir, they... They...
I was... They... I was...</font>

17
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,458
<font color="#00ffff">You don't panic. I am here, right?</font>

18
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,166
<font color="#00ffff">First, have some water.</font>

19
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,041
<font color="#00ffff">Come. Come...</font>

20
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:38,125
<font color="#00ffff">Don't worry. I will take care of you.
Come, come. Get in.</font>

21
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:41,208
<font color="#00ffff">Come, come. Get in.</font>

22
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,416
<font color="#00ffff">Come. Don't get scared. This is my house.</font>

23
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,250
<font color="#00ffff">At night there are no women constables
in the police station, that's why.</font>

24
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,708
<font color="#00ffff">Please come, please.</font>

25
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,791
<font color="#00ffff">What is this? It's so late.</font>

26
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,166
<font color="#00ffff">When I was coming,</font>

27
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,250
<font color="#00ffff">on the way, I saw this girl
having some problem.</font>

28
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,541
<font color="#00ffff">But all that later,
first show the girl one room.</font>

29
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
<font color="#00ffff">Come, my girl.</font>

30
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,291
<font color="#00ffff">Go.</font>

31
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,250
<font color="#00ffff">This is your room, go in.</font>

32
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,625
<font color="#00ffff">Wait? Where are you going?</font>

33
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:29,333
<font color="#00ffff">Don't get scared, I am here.
Come girl, come, come. Wait.</font>

34
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:40,250
<font color="#00ffff">This is the girl you sent me for?
Couldn't even guard one girl, is it?</font>

35
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:47,583
<font color="#00ffff">Nice, very nice.
The girl is cute. Very, very cute.</font>

36
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,500
<font color="#00ffff">I also want her for two days.
I want more money.</font>

37
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,916
<font color="#00ffff">What you sent today is not enough.</font>

38
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,875
<font color="#00ffff">Now that I've brought her,
you send me more money.</font>

39
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,458
<font color="#00ffff">Thanks, sir. Many thanks.</font>

40
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,916
<font color="#00ffff">Come, girl, sit down.</font>

41
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,083
<font color="#00ffff">See you then, my dear girl.</font>

42
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,291
<font color="#00ffff">-Sir, I am not that kind of girl.
-Don't worry, little one.</font>

43
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,416
<font color="#00ffff">Enough.</font>

44
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,833
<font color="#00ffff">Sir, I am not that kind of a girl, sir...</font>

45
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,750
<font color="#00ffff">Please save me.
Please, sir... Sir... Sir... Please.</font>

46
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:25,041
<font color="#00ffff">You whore, if you try to escape again,
I will chop you into a million pieces.</font>

47
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:30,416
<font color="#00ffff">I'm not that kind of girl, sir.
I'm not that kind of girl, sir.</font>

48
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,166
<font color="#00ffff">I beg you.</font>

49
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:40,875
<font color="#00ffff">Jaffer, don't give her food or water,
then she will understand.</font>

50
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,458
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, boss.</font>

51
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:47,666
<font color="#00ffff">Please, sir, I am not that kind of girl.</font>

52
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,625
<font color="#00ffff">I beg you, please leave me.</font>

53
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:55,833
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, Ramu,
send her to our Gandipet farm house.</font>

54
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:59,125
<font color="#00ffff">By tomorrow morning. No, no.
Wait, not there.</font>

55
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,791
<font color="#00ffff">Send her to the Shamirpet farm house.</font>

56
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,083
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, boss.</font>

57
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:17,166
<font color="#00ffff">Durga getting this rank is a matter
of pride not only for our college</font>

58
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,916
<font color="#00ffff">but for all the government colleges
in the state.</font>

59
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:28,041
<font color="#00ffff">Her success has provided a major
inspiration to the teachers and students.</font>

60
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,541
<font color="#00ffff">At a time when people are
competing with each other</font>

61
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:35,000
<font color="#00ffff">to pay lakhs of rupees
for admission into private colleges,</font>

62
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,291
<font color="#00ffff">when government colleges
figure in the news</font>

63
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:42,375
<font color="#00ffff">only for lack of facilities
and high failure rates,</font>

64
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:46,083
<font color="#00ffff">the success of students like Durga
is very important.</font>

65
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,208
<font color="#00ffff">Wishing her more and more successes
in the future</font>

66
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:52,000
<font color="#00ffff">and hoping that she will attain
great heights in life,</font>

67
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:56,125
<font color="#00ffff">we now invite Durga to come
and receive the award.</font>

68
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,083
<font color="#00ffff">Everyone here is complimenting me
for my success.</font>

69
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,875
<font color="#00ffff">But, in reality, it is not my success.</font>

70
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,500
<font color="#00ffff">Behind everyone's success
there is someone who provides the support.</font>

71
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,958
<font color="#00ffff">Similarly,</font>

72
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,583
<font color="#00ffff">there is someone
who is the key to my success.</font>

73
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:28,375
<font color="#00ffff">When I was sad,
his eyes were filled with tears.</font>

74
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,875
<font color="#00ffff">He pampered me when I threw tantrums,</font>

75
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,875
<font color="#00ffff">gave me courage when I had fear,</font>

76
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,708
<font color="#00ffff">and provided comic relief
when I was bored.</font>

77
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,916
<font color="#00ffff">He is the meaning of friendship,
he is the synonym for affection.</font>

78
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,750
<font color="#00ffff">Here, here.</font>

79
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,625
<font color="#00ffff">He is everything for me in this world,
he is my nature's companion,</font>

80
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:46,583
<font color="#00ffff">he gives form to my happiness...</font>

81
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,458
<font color="#00ffff">Elder brother's affection,</font>

82
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,000
<font color="#00ffff">mother's love,</font>

83
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:51,708
<font color="#00ffff">younger brother's pranks,</font>

84
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,875
<font color="#00ffff">younger sister's fondness
and father's support.</font>

85
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,750
<font color="#00ffff">He became everyone,</font>

86
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,791
<font color="#00ffff">so that I don't miss out
on any form of love.</font>

87
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,833
<font color="#00ffff">I won't be able to repay his debt
in this life and I pray that</font>

88
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,666
<font color="#00ffff">I get the same source of love as</font>

89
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:10,208
<font color="#00ffff">a companion in my next life too.</font>

90
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:14,625
<font color="#00ffff">He stood by my side, encouraged me,
and made success my slave.</font>

91
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:18,083
<font color="#00ffff">It doesn't matter if you don't
have someone</font>

92
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,666
<font color="#00ffff">to share your failure or sorrow with.</font>

93
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,125
<font color="#00ffff">But if the person responsible
for your success</font>

94
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:27,291
<font color="#00ffff">is not by your side to share the joy,</font>

95
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,541
<font color="#00ffff">then that success is as good as failure.</font>

96
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,083
<font color="#00ffff">My friend and companion
who stood by me at all times</font>

97
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,833
<font color="#00ffff">and ensured that success is mine,</font>

98
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:48,541
<font color="#00ffff">is none other than my father.</font>

99
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,541
<font color="#00ffff">You are felicitating me on my success,
but the success is not mine.</font>

100
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:06,083
<font color="#00ffff">It is my father's, who made me a winner.</font>

101
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:12,125
<font color="#00ffff">With the permission of the dignitaries
on the dais,</font>

102
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:15,625
<font color="#00ffff">I request you to present the award
to my father.</font>

103
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:20,833
<font color="#00ffff">We request Durga's father,
Mr. Sreenivas, to come on to the dais.</font>

104
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,541
<font color="#00ffff">Give it here.</font>

105
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,458
<font color="#00ffff">Come here.</font>

106
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,208
<font color="#00ffff">Congrats.</font>

107
00:12:57,083 --> 00:13:00,083
<font color="#00ffff">Please give it to her.</font>

108
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,083
<font color="#00ffff">She is my darling daughter.</font>

109
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:27,250
<font color="#00ffff">My Dearest Daughter</font>

110
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:37,250
<font color="#00ffff">Why do you want to wash the Shiva Linga
With the holy water of Ganges</font>

111
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:43,958
<font color="#00ffff">Which has been polluted by me?
Asks the frog to the devotee</font>

112
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,708
<font color="#00ffff">Little parrot, tender sapling</font>

113

<font color="#00ffff">Shyly, shyly says
Come, come, play with me</font>

114
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:13,208
<font color="#00ffff">Precious, first raindrop</font>

115

<font color="#00ffff">In this garden full of blossoms
Come sing and dance with me</font>

116
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:22,208
<font color="#00ffff">Your eyes should brim with happiness</font>

117
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:26,291
<font color="#00ffff">When you see our family blessed with
Sprinkles of nectar and milk</font>

118
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:31,708
<font color="#00ffff">Everybody should rejoice hearing our story
Everybody should celebrate seeing us</font>

<font color="#00ffff">My heart blossoms, smiles and shines
With your rise, I fall</font>

127
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,083
<font color="#00ffff">I rest as my heart competes
With my dreams</font>

128
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,416

00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:52,666
<font color="#00ffff">Your eyes should brim with happiness</font>

145
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:56,916
<font color="#00ffff">When you see our family blessed with
Sprinkles of nectar and milk</font>

146
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:02,291
<font color="#00ffff">Everybody should celebrate our story
Everybody should rejoice seeing us</font>

147
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,583
<font color="#00ffff">Little parrot, tender sapling</font>

148
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,083
<font color="#00ffff">Shyly, shyly says
Come, come, play with me</font>

149
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,875
<font color="#00ffff">Precious, first raindrop</font>

150
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,458
<font color="#00ffff">-Where shall I keep it?
-Keep it here.</font>

151
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,041
<font color="#00ffff">-Dad...
-What is this?</font>

152
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,791
<font color="#00ffff">-What? Dad, give it to me.
-Wait.</font>

153
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,750
<font color="#00ffff">How many times do I have
to tell you, "no" Hyderabad.</font>

154
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,416
<font color="#00ffff">Aren't there good colleges here?
Select one of them and join.</font>

155
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,208
<font color="#00ffff">You can go and come back daily.</font>

156
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,000
<font color="#00ffff">Children get easily spoilt in the city.</font>

157
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,708
<font color="#00ffff">Does that mean everyone studying
in Hyderabad is spoilt?</font>

158
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,541
<font color="#00ffff">You must study here. That is final.</font>

159
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:04,791
<font color="#00ffff">Mom, see, Dad is not agreeing.
Please talk to him once.</font>

160
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,500
<font color="#00ffff">Why should I interfere
in this father-daughter matter?</font>

161
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,791
<font color="#00ffff">You settle it between yourselves.</font>

162
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:12,458
<font color="#00ffff">Please, Dad, my sweet father,
please, agree.</font>

163
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,500
<font color="#00ffff">I said no.
Whatever you say, the answer is final.</font>

164
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,416
<font color="#00ffff">You must study here. That's all.</font>

165
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:28,375
<font color="#00ffff">Hello! Yes, Murugan. No, no, I'm coming.</font>

166
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,291
<font color="#00ffff">I knew you would do this.</font>

167
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,583
<font color="#00ffff">That's why I've kept another
application inside.</font>

168
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,541
<font color="#00ffff">Where are you going?</font>

169
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:22,250
<font color="#00ffff">I am leaving, Dad.
I will not talk to you, ever.</font>

170
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,208
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, come, nothing will happen.</font>

171
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,458
<font color="#00ffff">-I am telling you. Come, I said.
-Let me go.</font>

172
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,666
<font color="#00ffff">-What happened?
-Come inside.</font>

173
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,500
<font color="#00ffff">-I said, leave me.
-What happened?</font>

174
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:57,833
<font color="#00ffff">-I said don't shout.
-I said leave me.</font>

175
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,750
<font color="#00ffff">-Nothing will happen.
-Leave me.</font>

176
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,041
<font color="#00ffff">What happened?</font>

177
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:06,541
<font color="#00ffff">Leave me, let me go.
I'll complain to my mother.</font>

178
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,541
<font color="#00ffff">Sister...</font>

179
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,125
<font color="#00ffff">What's this? What's your age?
And what are you doing?</font>

180
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,500
<font color="#00ffff">This, at your age,
shame on you, you rascal.</font>

181
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,166
<font color="#00ffff">Leave me, let me go.</font>

182
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,791
<font color="#00ffff">Wait, rascal! I'll kill you today.
Let me get ahold of you.</font>

183
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,083
<font color="#00ffff">Wait, you wait.</font>

184
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,833
<font color="#00ffff">Leave me...</font>

185
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,291
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, stop...</font>

186
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,916
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, stop... You... I'll...</font>

187
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,750
<font color="#00ffff">-Leave me...
-Stop... Hey!</font>

188
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,208
<font color="#00ffff">You... I'll...</font>

189
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,416
<font color="#00ffff">You... I'll...</font>

190
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,000
<font color="#00ffff">-Hey, stop.
-Are you mad?</font>

191
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,458
<font color="#00ffff">Why are you beating that boy like that?</font>

192
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:46,000
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, stop. I'm warning you.</font>

193
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,625
<font color="#00ffff">We were just playing.
Why are you beating me like this?</font>

194
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:49,916
<font color="#00ffff">What is this?</font>

195
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,250
<font color="#00ffff">-Why are you beating me like this?
-This is the way you play? I'll kill you.</font>

196
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,666
<font color="#00ffff">What happened? Why are you beating him?</font>

197
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:02,250
<font color="#00ffff">-Beating? This fellow should be...
-Leave me.</font>

198
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,541
<font color="#00ffff">You know what he did to this girl?</font>

199
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:12,041
<font color="#00ffff">You, I'll put an end to your game today.</font>

200
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,000
<font color="#00ffff">I did what I saw on TV.
What's wrong with that?</font>

201
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:19,000
<font color="#00ffff">So, if you saw it on TV,
you will do such shameless things, right?</font>

202
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,083
<font color="#00ffff">Dad...</font>

203
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,666
<font color="#00ffff">Anyway, it is not you but your parents</font>

204
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,416
<font color="#00ffff">who have to be blamed for bringing
you up like this.</font>

205
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,458
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, leave him.
Who are you to beat up my son?</font>

206
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:32,541
<font color="#00ffff">See, how she has beaten him up. Devil,</font>

207
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,333
<font color="#00ffff">may your hands be paralysed.
You will burn in hell.</font>

208
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:36,791
<font color="#00ffff">You crazy bitch!</font>

209
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,333
<font color="#00ffff">We haven't ever beaten him
since he was born.</font>

210
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,375
<font color="#00ffff">That's the mistake you've done.
Had you punished him earlier,</font>

211
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,375
<font color="#00ffff">he would not have become like this today.</font>

212
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,958
<font color="#00ffff">Shut up, you bitch. Are you mad?</font>

213
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,458
<font color="#00ffff">If grown up girls
are not married off in time,</font>

214
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,958
<font color="#00ffff">this is the perverted way
in which they think,</font>

215
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,708
<font color="#00ffff">and become a headache for everyone.</font>

216
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,458
<font color="#00ffff">Why are you interfering in
others' affairs, my girl?</font>

217
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:01,833
<font color="#00ffff">You don't know this fellow.
Please ask the girl what happened.</font>

218
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,875
<font color="#00ffff">Please tell them what happened.</font>

219
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:08,458
<font color="#00ffff">He, he...</font>

220
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,250
<font color="#00ffff">Shut up.</font>

221
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,583
<font color="#00ffff">-Sister, sister, please let her speak.
-Nothing happened.</font>

222
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,708
<font color="#00ffff">Sister, sister, please let her speak.</font>

223
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,500
<font color="#00ffff">I am caught in between.</font>

224
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,333
<font color="#00ffff">What's your problem?</font>

225
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:21,416
<font color="#00ffff">Don't create things that never happened
and ruin my child's life.</font>

226
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,625
<font color="#00ffff">It's not like that, sister.</font>

227
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,708
<font color="#00ffff">Go, go and mind your own business.</font>

228
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,333
<font color="#00ffff">Sister...</font>

229
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:30,791
<font color="#00ffff">You come.</font>

230
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,166
<font color="#00ffff">Don't cry, my son.
See how she has beaten him.</font>

231
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:42,583
<font color="#00ffff">See, how it is.
A jaundiced eye sees yellow everywhere.</font>

232
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:46,583
<font color="#00ffff">The children must have been
playing or something.</font>

233
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:48,708
<font color="#00ffff">She saw that and has imagined things.</font>

234
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,458
<font color="#00ffff">Maybe she is trying to become
like her father,</font>

235
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,041
<font color="#00ffff">trying out social work.</font>

236
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,416
<font color="#00ffff">What are you still watching?
Go, go now.</font>

237
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,625
<font color="#00ffff">Don't have any other job.</font>

238
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,333
<font color="#00ffff">What's happening,
what is the fight about?</font>

239
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,791
<font color="#00ffff">Why do you always poke your nose into</font>

240
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:08,458
<font color="#00ffff">every stupid things that happens
in the village? Come, let's go.</font>

241
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,541
<font color="#00ffff">That girl was saved
only because of my timely arrival,</font>

242
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,250
<font color="#00ffff">but see what happened later.</font>

243
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,166
<font color="#00ffff">Anyway, it's a lesson for me.</font>

244
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,125
<font color="#00ffff">Only God knows
what really happened there,</font>

245
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,000
<font color="#00ffff">but why did you have to get
involved in it?</font>

246
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,083
<font color="#00ffff">Now, see what has happened.</font>

247
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,458
<font color="#00ffff">Before the public,
it was such a humiliation.</font>

248
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:33,041
<font color="#00ffff">What do you mean?</font>

249
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,958
<font color="#00ffff">You are ashamed of me
because I saved that girl.</font>

250
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,750
<font color="#00ffff">This is the plight of our village!</font>

251
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,875
<font color="#00ffff">Those who do such dirty things,
they are great people,</font>

252
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:44,541
<font color="#00ffff">and the rest are useless.
Is that how it is?</font>

253
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,708
<font color="#00ffff">Leave it now, forget it.</font>

254
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,916
<font color="#00ffff">Every time we meet,
she will have some issue or the other.</font>

255
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,458
<font color="#00ffff">Durga, do you know,
Chandini is getting married?</font>

256
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:55,833
<font color="#00ffff">Really?</font>

257
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,125
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, really...</font>

258
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,000
<font color="#00ffff">I didn't know about it myself
till recently.</font>

259
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:03,416
<font color="#00ffff">He is my brother's colleague,
he will be leaving for America soon.</font>

260
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,458
<font color="#00ffff">That's why my parents have decided
to hurry up with the wedding.</font>

261
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:11,000
<font color="#00ffff">You mean,
you've not even seen him till now?</font>

262
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,875
<font color="#00ffff">How will you blindly get into wedlock?</font>

263
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:17,250
<font color="#00ffff">Well,</font>

264
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:20,416
<font color="#00ffff">I've seen him last month when I went
to Bangalore to meet my brother.</font>

265
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:28,250
<font color="#00ffff">I see! Are all the arrangements done?
You are a secretive person.</font>

266
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:32,041
<font color="#00ffff">Anyway, you should all come for my wedding
at least two days in advance.</font>

267
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:35,708
<font color="#00ffff">Definitely?</font>

268
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:41,375
<font color="#00ffff">I'm getting late, shall we go?</font>

269
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:45,125
<font color="#00ffff">Let's go. One minute. You come.</font>

270
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:48,125
<font color="#00ffff">-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.</font>

271
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:55,666
<font color="#00ffff">Please post this for me.
Don't forget. It's my application.</font>

272
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,750
<font color="#00ffff">Okay.</font>

273
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:58,708
<font color="#00ffff">-Bye.
-Bye.</font>

274
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,666
<font color="#00ffff">Do you know what happened today?</font>

275
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:23,916
<font color="#00ffff">She again got into a fight with someone.
Our neighbour Laxmi told me.</font>

276
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:29,458
<font color="#00ffff">If this girl behaves like this,
who will marry her?</font>

277
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:36,000
<font color="#00ffff">I'm talking to you. Are you listening?</font>

278
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,125
<font color="#00ffff">What's the use, anyway?</font>

279
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:41,708
<font color="#00ffff">You are uplifting the towns
and she is uplifting the streets.</font>

280
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:48,958
<font color="#00ffff">Okay! I'll find out. How can you
find fault with such a worthy girl?</font>

281
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,250
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, God! Have you started again?</font>

282
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:57,125
<font color="#00ffff">Don't you have anything better to do
other than complaining about me every day?</font>

283
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:01,291
<font color="#00ffff">Both of you are the same,
and you won't realize it now.</font>

284
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:06,958
<font color="#00ffff">That's okay, Daddy.
Come, let's have dinner.</font>

285
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:11,166
<font color="#00ffff">Mom, you know, Chandini's marriage
is fixed for next week.</font>

286
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,750
<font color="#00ffff">We're all going two days in advance.</font>

287
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,791
<font color="#00ffff">Really?</font>

288
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:22,750
<font color="#00ffff">See, all her friends are getting married,</font>

289
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:25,375
<font color="#00ffff">and look at her,
getting into street fights.</font>

290
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,250
<font color="#00ffff">What's wrong in what I did?</font>

291
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:31,875
<font color="#00ffff">Is saving a girl's life wrong, Daddy?
You tell me?</font>

292
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:38,333
<font color="#00ffff">Daddy, have some water.
Daddy...</font>

293
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,708
<font color="#00ffff">Have some water.</font>

294
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:47,625
<font color="#00ffff">Don't shout.
Sit down and finish your dinner first.</font>

295
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:59,125
<font color="#00ffff">Listen, I'm warning you right now.</font>

296
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:02,708
<font color="#00ffff">Don't create any trouble in the wedding
and come back.</font>

297
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:12,000
<font color="#00ffff">You're the one who is spoiling her.
I won't tell you anything anymore.</font>

298
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:14,250
<font color="#00ffff">You'll realize it only through experience.</font>

299
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,333
<font color="#00ffff">I will not come in between
the both of you anymore.</font>

300
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:23,625
<font color="#00ffff">What is the use of telling
anything to these two?</font>

301
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,708
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, okay, I understood. Listen to me.</font>

302
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:33,875
<font color="#00ffff">First go to the Human Rights Commission,
then go to the police station.</font>

303
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:36,583
<font color="#00ffff">After that, go to the NGO
with the lawyer.</font>

304
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:39,791
<font color="#00ffff">Namaste, Uncle.</font>

305
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,875
<font color="#00ffff">Have you understood?
Or should I repeat it?</font>

306
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:43,791
<font color="#00ffff">Come...</font>

307
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,250
<font color="#00ffff">What's wrong?
Uncle seems to be busy.</font>

308
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:52,250
<font color="#00ffff">Nothing, he has been getting calls
since morning.</font>

309
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:55,041
<font color="#00ffff">It seems someone he knows in Hyderabad
is in some trouble.</font>

310
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:57,708
<font color="#00ffff">In any case, the father and the daughter</font>

311
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:59,625
<font color="#00ffff">won't get sleep unless they do
some social service.</font>

312
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,583
<font color="#00ffff">I believe you've stopped your studies?</font>

313
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:05,291
<font color="#00ffff">Take this, Uncle.</font>

314
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:08,250
<font color="#00ffff">Bright students like Durga should study.</font>

315
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:11,666
<font color="#00ffff">I've failed in the exam,
I thought it's better</font>

316
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,958
<font color="#00ffff">that I get married and settle down.</font>

317
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:16,250
<font color="#00ffff">The wedding is this coming Wednesday.
All of you should come.</font>

318
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,916
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, then. Aunty and Durga will come.</font>

319
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,125
<font color="#00ffff">What about you? You will not come?</font>

320
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:25,875
<font color="#00ffff">No, I'll be out of town next week.
I'm leaving for Hyderabad tomorrow.</font>

321
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:27,291
<font color="#00ffff">Durga and Aunty will come.</font>

322
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:31,625
<font color="#00ffff">All right, but send Durga
two days in advance.</font>

323
00:28:32,708 --> 00:28:33,791
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, Uncle, see you again.</font>

324
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:36,041
<font color="#00ffff">Sure, sure.</font>

325
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,041
<font color="#00ffff">-Have you been to Neelima's house?
-I'm going there now.</font>

326
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:03,833
<font color="#00ffff">-Are you asleep?
-No.</font>

327
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:06,500
<font color="#00ffff">What are you thinking about so seriously?</font>

328
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,750
<font color="#00ffff">Nothing, nothing much.</font>

329
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:10,583
<font color="#00ffff">-Is it about our daughter?
-Yes.</font>

330
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:16,041
<font color="#00ffff">All her friends are getting married,
we should also start thinking.</font>

331
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:18,958
<font color="#00ffff">Haven't you heard what Chandini said?</font>

332
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:22,416
<font color="#00ffff">They knew she can't clear her exams.
That's why they fixed her marriage.</font>

333
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,583
<font color="#00ffff">But our daughter is not like her.</font>

334
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:25,666
<font color="#00ffff">Let her study.</font>

335
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,625
<font color="#00ffff">Meanwhile, we'll find a good match.</font>

336
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:29,750
<font color="#00ffff">Why are you talking about
some other match?</font>

337
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:32,458
<font color="#00ffff">Haven't I told you about my uncle's son,
Raju from Rajole?</font>

338
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:36,291
<font color="#00ffff">That useless fellow?
That good for nothing character!</font>

339
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:39,333
<font color="#00ffff">I will not give my dearest daughter
to him!</font>

340
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:44,666
<font color="#00ffff">Are you expecting to find
a Prince Charming for your daughter?</font>

341
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:04,125
<font color="#00ffff">You think you are a young boy now!</font>

342
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:06,291
<font color="#00ffff">Thats's enough combing.
Enough, go, now.</font>

343
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:07,833
<font color="#00ffff">Get lost.</font>

344
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:09,791
<font color="#00ffff">Daddy, I'm leaving.</font>

345
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
<font color="#00ffff">Where?</font>

346
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:13,083
<font color="#00ffff">To Chandini's house.</font>

347
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,208
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, drop me at the registrar's office
on the way.</font>

348
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:17,458
<font color="#00ffff">Let's go.</font>

349
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,458
<font color="#00ffff">Come then, bye Mom.</font>

350
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:20,583
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, okay.</font>

351
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:24,041
<font color="#00ffff">Stop here.</font>

352
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:30,625
<font color="#00ffff">Namaste.</font>

353
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:31,916
<font color="#00ffff">Namaste. You are?</font>

354
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:33,541
<font color="#00ffff">We are from the neighbouring village,
Chintapalli.</font>

355
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,625
<font color="#00ffff">We've heard about you.</font>

356
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:40,000
<font color="#00ffff">We also tried meeting you a couple of
times but you weren't available.</font>

357
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,000
<font color="#00ffff">We are in deep trouble, that is why
we've sold half of our property.</font>

358
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:45,625
<font color="#00ffff">And we are here for that purpose.</font>

359
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,291
<font color="#00ffff">We heard that you have helped
many youngsters.</font>

360
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:51,958
<font color="#00ffff">Last month, because of you, 12 people
from our village got jobs in Dubai.</font>

361
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,833
<font color="#00ffff">If you can find some employment
for my daughter also...</font>

362
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:56,625
<font color="#00ffff">Does she have a passport?</font>

363
00:30:56,708 --> 00:30:58,166
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, she does.</font>

364
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:00,375
<font color="#00ffff">Okay. Let me see.</font>

365
00:31:00,833 --> 00:31:02,666
<font color="#00ffff">I'm going to Hyderabad next week.</font>

366
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,916
<font color="#00ffff">Bring the passport and
certificates before that.</font>

367
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
<font color="#00ffff">Sure, sir.</font>

368
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:08,083
<font color="#00ffff">All right, then.</font>

369
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:17,041
<font color="#00ffff">Then why don't you find a good job
for me in Dubai as well, Daddy?</font>

370
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,125
<font color="#00ffff">No way.</font>

371
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,500
<font color="#00ffff">If you leave, I'll be lonely.</font>

372
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:23,708
<font color="#00ffff">So, I'll never get a job for you.</font>

373
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:25,708
<font color="#00ffff">What work do you have in this office?</font>

374
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:27,250
<font color="#00ffff">Not getting married a second time, I hope?</font>

375
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:31,208
<font color="#00ffff">Please come. Sir is waiting for you.</font>

376
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:32,250
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, bye.</font>

377
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,333
<font color="#00ffff">Bye.</font>

378
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,750
<font color="#00ffff">Take...</font>

379
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:49,833
<font color="#00ffff">With the goddess' blessings,
you've got a good rank.</font>

380
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:53,083
<font color="#00ffff">Good things will happen to you.
You'll prosper.</font>

381
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:56,083
<font color="#00ffff">Sir, one minute.</font>

382
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:04,541
<font color="#00ffff">Sir. Well, my daughter's job...</font>

383
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:10,041
<font color="#00ffff">Don't worry. Leave it to me.
It's my responsibility.</font>

384
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,416
<font color="#00ffff">What about money?</font>

385
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:15,833
<font color="#00ffff">Don't worry about money.
I'll take care of it.</font>

386
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:20,333
<font color="#00ffff">After she gets the job,
we'll repay in installments.</font>

387
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:21,708
<font color="#00ffff">That's fine.</font>

388
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,666
<font color="#00ffff">Daddy, shall we leave?</font>

389
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,666
<font color="#00ffff">-May God bless you!
-Don't worry about anything.</font>

390
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:43,458
<font color="#00ffff">Is everything ready?</font>

391
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:44,625
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, everything is ready.</font>

392
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:46,958
<font color="#00ffff">My girl, I'm getting late for the train.</font>

393
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:48,250
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, yes, I'm coming, Daddy.</font>

394
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:49,708
<font color="#00ffff">Daddy.</font>

395
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:50,875
<font color="#00ffff">Yes.</font>

396
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:52,791
<font color="#00ffff">I made your favourite gongura chutney.</font>

397
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:54,583
<font color="#00ffff">Taste it and tell me how it is.</font>

398
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:56,500
<font color="#00ffff">Okay.</font>

399
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:59,041
<font color="#00ffff">Listen, find some time and supervise
the construction of the new house.</font>

400
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:00,291
<font color="#00ffff">Sure, I will.</font>

401
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:03,333
<font color="#00ffff">That's my daughter's dowry.</font>

402
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:04,625
<font color="#00ffff">Forget it, Dad!</font>

403
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:08,958
<font color="#00ffff">Your mother will be lonely
if you go elsewhere for your studies.</font>

404
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:12,291
<font color="#00ffff">That's why I'm telling you
to join a college here.</font>

405
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:17,291
<font color="#00ffff">By the way, it's not good to interfere in
other people's affairs, my darling.</font>

406
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,500
<font color="#00ffff">Now you have also started
talking like Mom.</font>

407
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:22,583
<font color="#00ffff">Come.</font>

408
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,208
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, I am leaving. Take care.</font>

409
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:34,750
<font color="#00ffff">What's this? Bag and all?</font>

410
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:36,333
<font color="#00ffff">For Chandini's wedding, Uncle.</font>

411
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:38,041
<font color="#00ffff">Thought Durga and I will go together.</font>

412
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:39,916
<font color="#00ffff">You're leaving for Hyderabad?</font>

413
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,500
<font color="#00ffff">Yes. Okay, I am leaving.</font>

414
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:44,000
<font color="#00ffff">Take care.</font>

415
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:46,375
<font color="#00ffff">How are you, Aunty?</font>

416
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,458
<font color="#00ffff">Come in.</font>

417
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:50,416
<font color="#00ffff">-Bye, Daddy.
-Bye.</font>

418
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:52,583
<font color="#00ffff">Listen, keep this in that room.</font>

419
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,583
<font color="#00ffff">Rammaiah, tie those flowers
a little bit higher,</font>

420
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:55,833
<font color="#00ffff">a little more higher.</font>

421
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:57,000
<font color="#00ffff">Bring it quickly.</font>

422
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:58,500
<font color="#00ffff">You people take hours to do anything.</font>

423
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:00,208
<font color="#00ffff">Sithaaiah, go and see
whether the milk has come or not?</font>

424
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:01,333
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, madam.</font>

425
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:03,375
<font color="#00ffff">Woman, how many times should I tell you?</font>

426
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,291
<font color="#00ffff">I don't know when you will do
what has been asked of you.</font>

427
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:06,458
<font color="#00ffff">I am on that work only.</font>

428
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:07,666
<font color="#00ffff">-How are you, Aunty?
-Come, come.</font>

429
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,791
<font color="#00ffff">Chandini is in that room. Go there.</font>

430
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:18,166
<font color="#00ffff">-How is this color?
-This is good.</font>

431
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:29,291
<font color="#00ffff">-Hi, Durga!
-Hey, hi!</font>

432
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:31,125
<font color="#00ffff">You are already dressed?</font>

433
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:34,416
<font color="#00ffff">You said you'll come in the morning
and you are coming now?</font>

434
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,250
<font color="#00ffff">Daddy was leaving for Hyderabad.
I thought I'd see him off.</font>

435
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:41,958
<font color="#00ffff">That she managed to even come
so early is a big thing.</font>

436
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:45,958
<font color="#00ffff">Aunty, these are my friends.
Durga and Neelima.</font>

437
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:48,208
<font color="#00ffff">She is the one who got the eighth rank
in the state.</font>

438
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:50,041
<font color="#00ffff">She was felicitated in the college also.</font>

439
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:52,416
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, I saw it in the newspaper.</font>

440
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,125
<font color="#00ffff">Give me those bags, come.</font>

441
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:57,333
<font color="#00ffff">Let me show you your room first.</font>

442
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:04,666
<font color="#00ffff">Come.</font>

443
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:07,500
<font color="#00ffff">Where is the groom's party?</font>

444
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:09,750
<font color="#00ffff">They are in Rajeev's house.</font>

445
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:14,208
<font color="#00ffff">Not bad. Managed to keep them close by!</font>

446
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,666
<font color="#00ffff">Hey. This is nice.</font>

447
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:19,166
<font color="#00ffff">It's nice, right?</font>

448
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:22,291
<font color="#00ffff">Give me the phone.</font>

449
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,333
<font color="#00ffff">-Let me speak first.
-Please don't...</font>

450
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:25,666
<font color="#00ffff">-Give me that phone.
-Hello?</font>

451
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,458
<font color="#00ffff">Durga, please give me that phone.</font>

452
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:31,583
<font color="#00ffff">-Hey, Durga, wait.
-Hi, you guys are coming, right?</font>

453
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:34,458
<font color="#00ffff">Oh...</font>

454
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:36,416
<font color="#00ffff">-Sorry!
-Sorry!</font>

455
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:41,375
<font color="#00ffff">This is my best friend, Durga.
Remember I told you.</font>

456
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:43,041
<font color="#00ffff">-Hi.
-Hi.</font>

457
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:47,333
<font color="#00ffff">And you are...</font>

458
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:50,250
<font color="#00ffff">You dumbo... He is my brother, Vijay.</font>

459
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:51,958
<font color="#00ffff">Works in Bengaluru.</font>

460
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:56,333
<font color="#00ffff">I'll call you later.</font>

461
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:57,416
<font color="#00ffff">Bye.</font>

462
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:27,583
<font color="#00ffff">This garland of rhythms</font>

463
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:36,458
<font color="#00ffff">In the rainbow of tender youth</font>

464
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:43,541
<font color="#00ffff">The moment I saw you</font>

465
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:51,750
<font color="#00ffff">My heart desired to say something to you</font>

466
00:36:54,541 --> 00:37:00,083
<font color="#00ffff">In those looks I see a beautiful image</font>

467
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:08,541
<font color="#00ffff">I can see my future bloom</font>

468
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:32,333
<font color="#00ffff">I want this moment with you to freeze</font>

469
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:39,958
<font color="#00ffff">The joy in me brims over</font>

470
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:49,458
<font color="#00ffff">Without you there is no rhythm in my heart</font>

471
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:57,750
<font color="#00ffff">Today my heart flows with a silent song</font>

472
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,791
<font color="#00ffff">Let me sing</font>

473
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:07,458
<font color="#00ffff">This silent rhythm of love</font>

474
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:13,583
<font color="#00ffff">This garland of rhythms</font>

475
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,583
<font color="#00ffff">I can see my future bloom</font>

476
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:54,000
<font color="#00ffff">I am anxious to join you</font>

477
00:38:57,041 --> 00:39:02,000
<font color="#00ffff">An unknown bond beckons me</font>

478
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:11,166
<font color="#00ffff">This tender youth that is blossoming</font>

479
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:19,250
<font color="#00ffff">I'm filled with dreams of you</font>

480
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:26,208
<font color="#00ffff">I don't know why</font>

481
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
<font color="#00ffff">These dreams of you in me</font>

482
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:35,208
<font color="#00ffff">In those looks I see a beautiful image</font>

483
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:43,791
<font color="#00ffff">I can see my future bloom</font>

484
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,791
<font color="#00ffff">The moment I saw you</font>

485
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,708
<font color="#00ffff">My heart desired to say something to you</font>

486
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,750
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, Aunty.</font>

487
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:08,833
<font color="#00ffff">Okay.</font>

488
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:10,875
<font color="#00ffff">We'll take our leave now.</font>

489
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:12,583
<font color="#00ffff">Wait, one minute.</font>

490
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:16,875
<font color="#00ffff">Vijay wanted to say something.</font>

491
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:18,166
<font color="#00ffff">Now that Chandini is married,</font>

492
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,125
<font color="#00ffff">we want to perform Vijay's marriage also.</font>

493
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:21,458
<font color="#00ffff">That's good.</font>

494
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,000
<font color="#00ffff">Vijay likes Durga.</font>

495
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,541
<font color="#00ffff">Thought of asking you for her hand.</font>

496
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:29,958
<font color="#00ffff">Only if you have no objection.</font>

497
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:37,458
<font color="#00ffff">How can I respond without
talking to Durga's father?</font>

498
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:39,333
<font color="#00ffff">I'll let you know after talking to him.</font>

499
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:40,791
<font color="#00ffff">That's fine.</font>

500
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,000
<font color="#00ffff">So, goodbye, then.</font>

501
00:40:44,666 --> 00:40:45,666
<font color="#00ffff">What?</font>

502
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:49,708
<font color="#00ffff">-What's the matter?
-Nothing, let's go.</font>

503
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:52,041
<font color="#00ffff">-Bye, Aunty.
-Okay, see you.</font>

504
00:40:58,333 --> 00:40:59,541
<font color="#00ffff">What's this, all of a sudden?</font>

505
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:01,125
<font color="#00ffff">I don't understand.</font>

506
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:04,125
<font color="#00ffff">No. No, they have not met before.</font>

507
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:07,416
<font color="#00ffff">They met at the wedding, that's all.</font>

508
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:12,416
<font color="#00ffff">The boy told his mother
and she approached me.</font>

509
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:14,208
<font color="#00ffff">What's the hurry?</font>

510
00:41:14,916 --> 00:41:17,041
<font color="#00ffff">She wants to study further. Let her.</font>

511
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:19,791
<font color="#00ffff">By the way, what does the boy do?</font>

512
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:21,625
<font color="#00ffff">He has a good job.</font>

513
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:23,625
<font color="#00ffff">Some computer engineer in Bengaluru.</font>

514
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:26,416
<font color="#00ffff">Draws a salary of more than
one lakh rupees per month.</font>

515
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:29,208
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, he lives in a city.
No, we don't want...</font>

516
00:41:29,416 --> 00:41:31,958
<font color="#00ffff">Can't trust these city boys.</font>

517
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:35,458
<font color="#00ffff">Listen, he is leaving for America
in two months' time.</font>

518
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,625
<font color="#00ffff">They just want the engagement right now.</font>

519
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:40,333
<font color="#00ffff">The marriage will be later,
maybe after a year or so.</font>

520
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:44,041
<font color="#00ffff">After the marriage,
he will take Durga to America.</font>

521
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:46,250
<font color="#00ffff">What, he is going to America?</font>

522
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:48,041
<font color="#00ffff">Looks like it's a good match.</font>

523
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:52,708
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, good family.
And the boy likes our girl.</font>

524
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:54,500
<font color="#00ffff">The boy likes the girl.</font>

525
00:41:54,583 --> 00:41:55,958
<font color="#00ffff">That's fine, but what about the girl?
She should also like...</font>

526
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:58,000
<font color="#00ffff">She is here. You ask her yourself.</font>

527
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:00,166
<font color="#00ffff">Talk...</font>

528
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:04,958
<font color="#00ffff">Hello, Daddy.</font>

529
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:07,708
<font color="#00ffff">What, my dear, do you like the boy?</font>

530
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,500
<font color="#00ffff">That's not an issue.</font>

531
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:16,541
<font color="#00ffff">I want to study further.
If he agrees to that, I will...</font>

532
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:19,541
<font color="#00ffff">Okay... Okay, I understand.</font>

533
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:22,750
<font color="#00ffff">I will speak to them,
only if they agree.</font>

534
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:26,166
<font color="#00ffff">We will have an engagement. Happy?</font>

535
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:27,958
<font color="#00ffff">Why don't you say something?</font>

536
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:30,041
<font color="#00ffff">Are you feeling shy, my dear?</font>

537
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:34,875
<font color="#00ffff">Okay. Okay, bye.</font>

538
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:55,541
<font color="#00ffff">You rogues, what kind of behavior
is this in a temple?</font>

539
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:58,875
<font color="#00ffff">Will you do this to
your mother or sisters?</font>

540
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:03,000
<font color="#00ffff">Come, come outside.</font>

541
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:05,041
<font color="#00ffff">You think you can treat women like dirt?</font>

542
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:06,333
<font color="#00ffff">Because of rascals like you,</font>

543
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:09,166
<font color="#00ffff">women can't even
walk in the temple safely.</font>

544
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:14,666
<font color="#00ffff">What happened?</font>

545
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,125
<font color="#00ffff">This fellow was...</font>

546
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:18,041
<font color="#00ffff">Leave it, let's go.</font>

547
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:20,083
<font color="#00ffff">No way. Let go of my hand.</font>

548
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:21,750
<font color="#00ffff">I will not remain silent if I see anybody
misbehaving with girls.</font>

549
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:44,166
<font color="#00ffff">-Hi.
-Hi.</font>

550
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:47,791
<font color="#00ffff">I'm sorry.</font>

551
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,875
<font color="#00ffff">Why? I was a witness
to the whole thing.</font>

552
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:52,750
<font color="#00ffff">Why should you apologize for it?</font>

553
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,916
<font color="#00ffff">In my view, girls should be like this.</font>

554
00:43:57,208 --> 00:43:59,416
<font color="#00ffff">My father brought me up like this.</font>

555
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,041
<font color="#00ffff">Your father has spoken to my mother.</font>

556
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:03,833
<font color="#00ffff">Our engagement will happen
this coming week.</font>

557
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,791
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, I've been told so...
I'll see you then.</font>

558
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:25,625
<font color="#00ffff">Very nice. Very nice.
Your earrings are really matching.</font>

559
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:28,041
<font color="#00ffff">Listen, the groom's family has arrived,
please receive them.</font>

560
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:35,791
<font color="#00ffff">-Namaskar.
-Namaskar.</font>

561
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,000
<font color="#00ffff">Please come.</font>

562
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:55,416
<font color="#00ffff">It's almost the auspicious time for
the engagement. Bring the bride-to-be.</font>

563
00:44:56,875 --> 00:44:58,416
<font color="#00ffff">My dear, please come.</font>

564
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:18,083
<font color="#00ffff">Parents on both sides,
exchange the gift offerings.</font>

565
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
<font color="#00ffff">One moment, please.</font>

566
00:45:26,666 --> 00:45:27,916
<font color="#00ffff">What is it now?</font>

567
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:32,875
<font color="#00ffff">I want to say something.</font>

568
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:33,958
<font color="#00ffff">What?</font>

569
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:35,125
<font color="#00ffff">I want to study further.</font>

570
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:39,500
<font color="#00ffff">Oh! That... Your father informed us.</font>

571
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:41,916
<font color="#00ffff">Of course. Study further.</font>

572
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,250
<font color="#00ffff">Not only till you get married,
but even after that. Okay?</font>

573
00:45:57,083 --> 00:45:59,458
<font color="#00ffff">The two of you exchange rings.</font>

574
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:29,250
<font color="#00ffff">Aunty, this is Vijay speaking.</font>

575
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:31,291
<font color="#00ffff">Tell me, my boy.</font>

576
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:32,375
<font color="#00ffff">Has Durga gone to bed?</font>

577
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:36,083
<font color="#00ffff">No, she is reading something.
I'll just call her.</font>

578
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:39,000
<font color="#00ffff">Durga... Durga?</font>

579
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:40,416
<font color="#00ffff">Mom, what is it?</font>

580
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,208
<font color="#00ffff">Vijay's on the phone.</font>

581
00:46:45,666 --> 00:46:47,416
<font color="#00ffff">Hello?</font>

582
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:50,083
<font color="#00ffff">-Hello?
-Hello?</font>

583
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:57,291
<font color="#00ffff">Hello, can't hear you clearly.
There's a lot of disturbance.</font>

584
00:46:58,666 --> 00:47:00,375
<font color="#00ffff">I came out to do some shopping.</font>

585
00:47:02,291 --> 00:47:03,458
<font color="#00ffff">Now I can hear you.</font>

586
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:04,708
<font color="#00ffff">How are you?</font>

587
00:47:05,208 --> 00:47:06,458
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, I'm all right.</font>

588
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:09,083
<font color="#00ffff">Durga, I'm going out
for a training program.</font>

589
00:47:09,666 --> 00:47:11,583
<font color="#00ffff">I won't be able to call you for two weeks.</font>

590
00:47:11,666 --> 00:47:13,416
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, but try.</font>

591
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:31,500
<font color="#00ffff">Mom, come, let me show you.</font>

592
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:36,750
<font color="#00ffff">Here, there will be shelves. Okay?
TV will come over here.</font>

593
00:47:36,833 --> 00:47:39,000
<font color="#00ffff">Here there will be a showcase.</font>

594
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:45,291
<font color="#00ffff">Stop it, they have just begun the work.
Let them complete it.</font>

595
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:06,666
<font color="#00ffff">See, there is a letter.</font>

596
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:19,750
<font color="#00ffff">Mom! Mom!</font>

597
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:24,916
<font color="#00ffff">I've got an invitation letter for
an interview from a college in Hyderabad.</font>

598
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,125
<font color="#00ffff">The interview is on Monday.</font>

599
00:48:26,375 --> 00:48:28,916
<font color="#00ffff">You watch. I'll definitely get a seat.</font>

600
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:30,666
<font color="#00ffff">-This coming Monday?
-Yes.</font>

601
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:35,000
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, no! It's already Saturday today.
That means it's day after tomorrow.</font>

602
00:48:35,083 --> 00:48:37,208
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, so what?</font>

603
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:41,291
<font color="#00ffff">I'll just have to call up Daddy
and board the train.</font>

604
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,666
<font color="#00ffff">Once I reach there,
Daddy will take care of the rest.</font>

605
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:47,458
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, you go there and face the scoldings.</font>

606
00:48:47,875 --> 00:48:51,250
<font color="#00ffff">He has already told you so many times
that it's enough if you study here.</font>

607
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:53,958
<font color="#00ffff">If he comes to know of this now,
not just you, he will shout at me as well.</font>

608
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:55,750
<font color="#00ffff">No such thing will happen, Mom.</font>

609
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,625
<font color="#00ffff">Believe me.
Once Daddy sees me, he won't say anything.</font>

610
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:00,208
<font color="#00ffff">Let's call him up right away.</font>

611
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
<font color="#00ffff">Shucks! Out of coverage area.</font>

612
00:49:16,958 --> 00:49:18,958
<font color="#00ffff">Give it to me. I'll try.</font>

613
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:24,500
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, my God! If I miss the evening train,</font>

614
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:26,916
<font color="#00ffff">everything will go to waste.</font>

615
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:35,375
<font color="#00ffff">Give it to me.</font>

616
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:43,958
<font color="#00ffff">Eat... Eat something.</font>

617
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:01,500
<font color="#00ffff">You don't worry... Do one thing.</font>

618
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,041
<font color="#00ffff">You go get ready.</font>

619
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:05,208
<font color="#00ffff">I'll try calling him again.</font>

620
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:08,041
<font color="#00ffff">In any case, he will call at night,</font>

621
00:50:08,125 --> 00:50:10,541
<font color="#00ffff">and then I'll tell him to pick you up
from the station.</font>

622
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,166
<font color="#00ffff">Go, get ready quickly.</font>

623
00:50:14,708 --> 00:50:17,083
<font color="#00ffff">You are my sweet mom.</font>

624
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:37,708
<font color="#00ffff">-It's almost time.
-Yes, I am coming, wait.</font>

625
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:43,541
<font color="#00ffff">-It's almost time.
-Yes, I am coming. Wait.</font>

626
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:44,958
<font color="#00ffff">What is this?</font>

627
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,291
<font color="#00ffff">Your father is fond of cheese.</font>

628
00:50:47,375 --> 00:50:48,375
<font color="#00ffff">Give this to him.</font>

629
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:49,791
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, no! Not again!</font>

630
00:50:49,958 --> 00:50:51,416
<font color="#00ffff">Okay. Okay, come, I am getting late.</font>

631
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:10,000
<font color="#00ffff">Have you packed everything?</font>

632
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:19,333
<font color="#00ffff">Come fast.</font>

633
00:51:38,291 --> 00:51:40,208
<font color="#00ffff">-Is this the one?
-Yes, yes.</font>

634
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:44,708
<font color="#00ffff">Go carefully.</font>

635
00:51:46,291 --> 00:51:48,458
<font color="#00ffff">It's all right till I reach Hyderabad.</font>

636
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:51,458
<font color="#00ffff">I don't know if Mr. Sreenivasan will
be there to receive me once I reach.</font>

637
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:55,083
<font color="#00ffff">There's still time.
By the time you reach, I'll inform him.</font>

638
00:51:55,166 --> 00:51:56,708
<font color="#00ffff">You don't get scared.</font>

639
00:51:56,875 --> 00:52:01,916
<font color="#00ffff">Me, scared?
Mom, I am not a kid anymore.</font>

640
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:03,750
<font color="#00ffff">You go, Mom.</font>

641
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:08,791
<font color="#00ffff">-Be careful.
-Okay, bye.</font>

642
00:52:21,541 --> 00:52:24,541
<font color="#00ffff">Careful, don't leave your bag carelessly.</font>

643
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:27,583
<font color="#00ffff">Don't eat anything carelessly...
Call me as soon as you reach.</font>

644
00:53:05,958 --> 00:53:09,458
<font color="#00ffff">Where were you?
Why is no one picking the phone?</font>

645
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:13,666
<font color="#00ffff">We tried calling you,
but you were out of coverage area.</font>

646
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:16,875
<font color="#00ffff">Listen, Durga got an interview call
from a college in Hyderabad,</font>

647
00:53:16,958 --> 00:53:18,125
<font color="#00ffff">the interview is this Monday.</font>

648
00:53:18,541 --> 00:53:19,958
<font color="#00ffff">So, what do you want me to do now?</font>

649
00:53:20,083 --> 00:53:22,541
<font color="#00ffff">Haven't I told you any number of times
that this is not a place to come to?</font>

650
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:25,500
<font color="#00ffff">Leave it now. I tried so many times.</font>

651
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:29,041
<font color="#00ffff">I put her on the Gautami Express
and returned just now.</font>

652
00:53:29,875 --> 00:53:33,041
<font color="#00ffff">Please receive her tomorrow morning
from the station.</font>

653
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:34,166
<font color="#00ffff">Do I have an option?</font>

654
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:35,875
<font color="#00ffff">Inspite of telling you so many times,
you don't understand.</font>

655
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:37,958
<font color="#00ffff">I don't know all that...</font>

656
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:41,541
<font color="#00ffff">Just receive her at the station
tomorrow morning.</font>

657
00:53:43,583 --> 00:53:45,250
<font color="#00ffff">Hello? Hello?</font>

658
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:52,208
<font color="#00ffff">Murugan, send these three to Gandipet
and these to Shaikpet.</font>

659
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,916
<font color="#00ffff">Take good care of these foreign girls.</font>

660
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,500
<font color="#00ffff">All are young over there.</font>

661
00:53:57,791 --> 00:53:59,541
<font color="#00ffff">The minister's son created a scene
the other day after taking the girls</font>

662
00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:01,416
<font color="#00ffff">and posting pictures on the Internet.</font>

663
00:54:01,708 --> 00:54:03,750
<font color="#00ffff">I am here. I will take care.</font>

664
00:54:03,833 --> 00:54:05,000
<font color="#00ffff">What will you take care of?</font>

665
00:54:05,083 --> 00:54:06,833
<font color="#00ffff">The other day you took Laxmi,
saying that they were two...</font>

666
00:54:06,916 --> 00:54:08,458
<font color="#00ffff">Then with ten of them...</font>

667
00:54:08,666 --> 00:54:11,666
<font color="#00ffff">Moreover, the girl had razor cuts
all over her body.</font>

668
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:14,333
<font color="#00ffff">Why make me utter all that? You bitch...</font>

669
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:19,416
<font color="#00ffff">Leave it. It's getting late, let's go.</font>

670
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:20,500
<font color="#00ffff">Go.</font>

671
00:54:20,583 --> 00:54:22,583
<font color="#00ffff">Come on, come on, leave quickly.</font>

672
00:55:19,458 --> 00:55:20,458
<font color="#00ffff">Daddy...</font>

673
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:25,083
<font color="#00ffff">Do you have any sense?</font>

674
00:55:25,166 --> 00:55:26,958
<font color="#00ffff">I told you to study there only.</font>

675
00:55:27,041 --> 00:55:28,708
<font color="#00ffff">But you don't care about what I say.</font>

676
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:30,041
<font color="#00ffff">Then I won't...</font>

677
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:32,791
<font color="#00ffff">Where are you going? Come, let's go.</font>

678
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:35,125
<font color="#00ffff">What wrong have I committed?</font>

679
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:36,583
<font color="#00ffff">Why are you shouting at me like this?</font>

680
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:37,750
<font color="#00ffff">There is no shortage of temper.</font>

681
00:55:37,833 --> 00:55:39,416
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, this is also my mistake.
Forgive me...</font>

682
00:55:42,458 --> 00:55:45,291
<font color="#00ffff">Listen to my words.
Come, dear.</font>

683
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,250
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, take this bag.</font>

684
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:48,333
<font color="#00ffff">Come.</font>

685
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,416
<font color="#00ffff">-Is this the one?
-Yes, get in.</font>

686
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,958
<font color="#00ffff">Boss, here...</font>

687
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:13,125
<font color="#00ffff">Take us to Hotel Royal.</font>

688
00:56:13,208 --> 00:56:14,208
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, sir.</font>

689
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:17,125
<font color="#00ffff">Dad, are we not going home?</font>

690
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,708
<font color="#00ffff">There are some repairs going on at home.</font>

691
00:56:21,083 --> 00:56:23,083
<font color="#00ffff">That's why we are going to the hotel.</font>

692
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:25,708
<font color="#00ffff">Your college is also close by.</font>

693
00:56:28,666 --> 00:56:30,625
<font color="#00ffff">Listen, has our daughter reached?</font>

694
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:33,500
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, she is here. Talk to her.</font>

695
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:35,625
<font color="#00ffff">Hello, Mummy?</font>

696
00:56:35,708 --> 00:56:37,375
<font color="#00ffff">Have you reached safely?</font>

697
00:56:37,458 --> 00:56:39,041
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, yes. I have reached safely.</font>

698
00:56:39,125 --> 00:56:41,750
<font color="#00ffff">God! Hyderabad is so big.</font>

699
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:43,583
<font color="#00ffff">I'll stay here for ten days.</font>

700
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,083
<font color="#00ffff">Don't go outside alone.</font>

701
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:46,833
<font color="#00ffff">-Okay, I'll call you later.
-Be careful.</font>

702
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
<font color="#00ffff">Stop. Stop...</font>

703
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:49,125
<font color="#00ffff">One minute...</font>

704
00:56:49,208 --> 00:56:50,208
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, stop...</font>

705
00:57:05,708 --> 00:57:09,083
<font color="#00ffff">Daddy... What a big building!</font>

706
00:57:18,458 --> 00:57:20,458
<font color="#00ffff">Don't peep out too much.</font>

707
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:26,833
<font color="#00ffff">Stop... Stop... Tankbund, Daddy.</font>

708
00:57:27,458 --> 00:57:28,458
<font color="#00ffff">Stop.</font>

709
00:57:28,875 --> 00:57:29,875
<font color="#00ffff">Tankbund!</font>

710
00:57:29,958 --> 00:57:31,375
<font color="#00ffff">Durga, what's this? Come on.</font>

711
00:57:32,375 --> 00:57:33,666
<font color="#00ffff">Durga!</font>

712
00:57:37,166 --> 00:57:39,041
<font color="#00ffff">Now get into the car first, come.</font>

713
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:40,708
<font color="#00ffff">See... Buddha's statue.</font>

714
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,041
<font color="#00ffff">Okay. Okay, we will come back later.</font>

715
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,583
<font color="#00ffff">It's very nice. Wait, Daddy.</font>

716
00:57:43,666 --> 00:57:44,666
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, we will come back later.</font>

717
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:46,041
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, Dad. Birla Mandir!</font>

718
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:47,875
<font color="#00ffff">We will come back later.
Now get into the car first, come.</font>

719
00:57:47,958 --> 00:57:50,708
<font color="#00ffff">We will go there now. Please, Daddy.</font>

720
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:03,875
<font color="#00ffff">Come.</font>

721
00:58:14,208 --> 00:58:15,208
<font color="#00ffff">Hello, good morning!</font>

722
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:16,625
<font color="#00ffff">Sir, it has been so long.</font>

723
00:58:16,708 --> 00:58:18,833
<font color="#00ffff">You seem to have forgotten us.</font>

724
00:58:19,375 --> 00:58:21,250
<font color="#00ffff">You have stopped coming to our hotel.</font>

725
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:22,791
<font color="#00ffff">You know...</font>

726
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:24,958
<font color="#00ffff">You seem to be patronizing
only big hotels now.</font>

727
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:27,375
<font color="#00ffff">Why will you come to a small place now!</font>

728
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:28,500
<font color="#00ffff">No, no... Nothing like that.</font>

729
00:58:28,916 --> 00:58:31,666
<font color="#00ffff">Haven't had much work here.
That's why...</font>

730
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
<font color="#00ffff">Anyway, give us the room first.</font>

731
00:58:34,375 --> 00:58:35,958
<font color="#00ffff">Take this, sir, 115.</font>

732
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:42,125
<font color="#00ffff">Daddy, do you stay in hotels?</font>

733
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
<font color="#00ffff">Only when I am working
overtime for the office... I have to come.</font>

734
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:04,291
<font color="#00ffff">Daddy, I'm sure I'll get the seat.</font>

735
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,166
<font color="#00ffff">And then we'll go home.</font>

736
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,750
<font color="#00ffff">I feel uncomfortable here.</font>

737
00:59:10,458 --> 00:59:12,666
<font color="#00ffff">Even if the house is being repaired,
it is all right.</font>

738
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:15,375
<font color="#00ffff">It's such a waste of money here.</font>

739
00:59:17,625 --> 00:59:20,291
<font color="#00ffff">By the way, you've to take me around
the city today.</font>

740
00:59:20,375 --> 00:59:21,375
<font color="#00ffff">Okay.</font>

741
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:25,625
<font color="#00ffff">Film City, IMAX, airport.
I want to see all of them.</font>

742
00:59:30,708 --> 00:59:31,958
<font color="#00ffff">Why don't you talk?</font>

743
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,500
<font color="#00ffff">Once the college starts
it won't be possible.</font>

744
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:40,916
<font color="#00ffff">Daddy, the phone has been ringing for
so long, why don't you take the call?</font>

745
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
<font color="#00ffff">Nothing important, if I pick it up,
it will be some new work.</font>

746
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:51,458
<font color="#00ffff">Why are you in such a serious mood?</font>

747
00:59:53,166 --> 00:59:55,083
<font color="#00ffff">Are you still upset with me?</font>

748
00:59:55,166 --> 00:59:57,333
<font color="#00ffff">No, no, nothing like that, my child.</font>

749
00:59:57,416 --> 00:59:59,166
<font color="#00ffff">Then, tell me...</font>

750
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,500
<font color="#00ffff">When are we going for sight seeing?</font>

751
01:00:01,791 --> 01:00:04,375
<font color="#00ffff">We still have time, we'll do it later.</font>

752
01:00:04,708 --> 01:00:06,625
<font color="#00ffff">No, I want to go today itself.</font>

753
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:12,500
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, okay, we'll go, get ready first.</font>

754
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:15,875
<font color="#00ffff">Really? Shall we go to see the city today?</font>

755
01:00:15,958 --> 01:00:17,083
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, go get ready.</font>

756
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:30,833
<font color="#00ffff">Breaking news. Another sex racket has
come to light in the city of Hyderabad.</font>

757
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:33,708
<font color="#00ffff">Girls from different states and
other countries have been found.</font>

758
01:00:33,791 --> 01:00:37,500
<font color="#00ffff">It is revealed that some well-to-do
people are behind this racket.</font>

759
01:00:37,958 --> 01:00:41,458
<font color="#00ffff">In a raid conducted with the help of an
NGO on a Banjara Hills spa this morning,</font>

760
01:00:41,666 --> 01:00:45,833
<font color="#00ffff">the police rescued 20 girls,
including three Russians.</font>

761
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:48,333
<font color="#00ffff">The police have registered a case
against the owners for running</font>

762
01:00:48,416 --> 01:00:50,041
<font color="#00ffff">a brothel in the guise of a spa.
The owners are absconding.</font>

763
01:00:50,125 --> 01:00:51,291
<font color="#00ffff">Hello!</font>

764
01:00:52,291 --> 01:00:53,666
<font color="#00ffff">The police commissioner has
promised action against them.</font>

765
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,708
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, I'm in the city...
Will come back soon.</font>

766
01:01:02,083 --> 01:01:03,083
<font color="#00ffff">Hello?</font>

767
01:01:03,166 --> 01:01:05,166
<font color="#00ffff">Hello, where were you?</font>

768
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:09,166
<font color="#00ffff">Durga disconnected the call quickly
when I called a while ago...</font>

769
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,333
<font color="#00ffff">Did you reach the station late?</font>

770
01:01:12,416 --> 01:01:13,416
<font color="#00ffff">No, I was on time.</font>

771
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,916
<font color="#00ffff">Please give the phone to Durga.</font>

772
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:16,375
<font color="#00ffff">She is in the bathroom.</font>

773
01:01:16,541 --> 01:01:17,625
<font color="#00ffff">You must have shouted at her.</font>

774
01:01:18,333 --> 01:01:19,833
<font color="#00ffff">Don't go on scolding her...</font>

775
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:21,625
<font color="#00ffff">She came there with lots of hopes.</font>

776
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:32,750
<font color="#00ffff">Durga?</font>

777
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:33,750
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, Daddy?</font>

778
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:35,541
<font color="#00ffff">See, I've to go out urgently.
Will be back soon...</font>

779
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:38,625
<font color="#00ffff">I'll send you some breakfast.</font>

780
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:39,708
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, Daddy.</font>

781
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:43,125
<font color="#00ffff">Daddy. Come back soon...</font>

782
01:01:43,208 --> 01:01:45,208
<font color="#00ffff">We'll have to go to Birla Mandir first,
and after that...</font>

783
01:01:45,291 --> 01:01:46,291
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, okay.</font>

784
01:01:46,375 --> 01:01:48,250
<font color="#00ffff">I'm closing the door afterwards,</font>

785
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:49,666
<font color="#00ffff">come and bolt it from inside.</font>

786
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:50,750
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, Daddy.</font>

787
01:01:54,125 --> 01:01:56,708
<font color="#00ffff">Send some breakfast to the room.
I'll be back soon.</font>

788
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:09,083
<font color="#00ffff">Breakfast.</font>

789
01:02:09,166 --> 01:02:10,583
<font color="#00ffff">Please keep it inside.</font>

790
01:02:20,916 --> 01:02:25,541
<font color="#00ffff">If you want something special,
let me know, I'll get it.</font>

791
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:28,625
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, get lost.</font>

792
01:02:35,291 --> 01:02:36,750
<font color="#00ffff">We have to do something quickly.</font>

793
01:02:36,875 --> 01:02:38,666
<font color="#00ffff">Since Russian girls are also involved,
it is going to be very difficult.</font>

794
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:39,750
<font color="#00ffff">What happened?</font>

795
01:02:40,291 --> 01:02:41,708
<font color="#00ffff">What had to happen.</font>

796
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:42,791
<font color="#00ffff">It is the work of the NGO.</font>

797
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:45,083
<font color="#00ffff">Their plan is to restore the girls to
their families in their native villages.</font>

798
01:02:45,833 --> 01:02:49,500
<font color="#00ffff">The Russian girls will not speak,
their passports are with me.</font>

799
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:53,083
<font color="#00ffff">For the local girls we can immediately
arrange parents...</font>

800
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:56,125
<font color="#00ffff">If it is really needed,
we can even bring the real parents.</font>

801
01:02:57,166 --> 01:03:01,208
<font color="#00ffff">At any cost, we have to bring
them to the court by tomorrow afternoon.</font>

802
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:05,041
<font color="#00ffff">I've sent Chandu to prepare ration cards
and other papers.</font>

803
01:03:06,125 --> 01:03:10,208
<font color="#00ffff">Purushu, take the print media and all the
TV channels and go to that NGO office.</font>

804
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,416
<font color="#00ffff">That bitch of a woman who runs the
NGO is a tough nut...</font>

805
01:03:12,625 --> 01:03:14,625
<font color="#00ffff">I don't think anything will be solved
even if we approach her.</font>

806
01:03:16,583 --> 01:03:17,666
<font color="#00ffff">You do one thing.</font>

807
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:19,708
<font color="#00ffff">Take that Jameela with you and
somehow meet the girls and</font>

808
01:03:19,791 --> 01:03:24,708
<font color="#00ffff">tell them to identify the people they'll
meet in the court as their parents.</font>

809
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:25,875
<font color="#00ffff">Okay.</font>

810
01:03:26,166 --> 01:03:28,666
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, all of you start quickly.</font>

811
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:29,791
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, sir.</font>

812
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:37,250
<font color="#00ffff">Greetings.</font>

813
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:42,583
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, I'll call you later.</font>

814
01:03:42,666 --> 01:03:44,208
<font color="#00ffff">So, what happened?</font>

815
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,666
<font color="#00ffff">I'll get all our girls out by afternoon.</font>

816
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:49,208
<font color="#00ffff">What about the Russian girls?</font>

817
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:51,875
<font color="#00ffff">It's not as easy as it used to be.</font>

818
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:54,666
<font color="#00ffff">Those NGO people are a big headache.</font>

819
01:03:55,375 --> 01:03:56,375
<font color="#00ffff">Let's do one thing.</font>

820
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:59,416
<font color="#00ffff">We'll get hold of
some white-skinned fellow,</font>

821
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:02,375
<font color="#00ffff">make him tell the police that the girls
are his friends or relatives,</font>

822
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,375
<font color="#00ffff">send passports with him.</font>

823
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,625
<font color="#00ffff">Then they'll deport them back quickly.</font>

824
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:10,416
<font color="#00ffff">We'll bring them again in the next batch.</font>

825
01:04:10,916 --> 01:04:13,583
<font color="#00ffff">That sounds good.
Then we won't have any hassle.</font>

826
01:04:15,916 --> 01:04:19,583
<font color="#00ffff">So, that's it.
I'll be away for two weeks.</font>

827
01:04:19,666 --> 01:04:21,666
<font color="#00ffff">What? At a time like this?</font>

828
01:04:21,916 --> 01:04:23,958
<font color="#00ffff">I've to attend some urgent work.</font>

829
01:04:24,458 --> 01:04:27,375
<font color="#00ffff">This matter will be
settled by the evening.</font>

830
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:29,000
<font color="#00ffff">I'll be in the city only.</font>

831
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:31,166
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, go.</font>

832
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:33,125
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, sir, I will leave.</font>

833
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:37,000
<font color="#00ffff">What happened to this fellow?</font>

834
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:38,791
<font color="#00ffff">He is acting somewhat strange.</font>

835
01:04:39,541 --> 01:04:41,458
<font color="#00ffff">Looks like he is doing
business on his own.</font>

836
01:04:41,541 --> 01:04:43,541
<font color="#00ffff">It seems he brought
a nice figure this morning.</font>

837
01:04:44,041 --> 01:04:46,458
<font color="#00ffff">Really? Where is the girl?</font>

838
01:04:46,791 --> 01:04:50,500
<font color="#00ffff">We came to know that he brought her
for himself. Kept her in the Hotel Royal.</font>

839
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:52,250
<font color="#00ffff">No more thinking.</font>

840
01:04:52,583 --> 01:04:56,125
<font color="#00ffff">Without his knowledge, bring her to our
Narayan Reddy guest house.</font>

841
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:57,958
<font color="#00ffff">That I have already organized.</font>

842
01:05:07,958 --> 01:05:09,958
<font color="#00ffff">Sir, the key is here.</font>

843
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,541
<font color="#00ffff">What? Where is the girl?</font>

844
01:05:13,666 --> 01:05:15,500
<font color="#00ffff">A woman came and took her along,
saying that you've sent her.</font>

845
01:05:15,791 --> 01:05:18,166
<font color="#00ffff">Which woman? Who?</font>

846
01:05:18,375 --> 01:05:19,583
<font color="#00ffff">I don't know.</font>

847
01:05:57,041 --> 01:05:58,416
<font color="#00ffff">Sir, what happened? Sir, sir?</font>

848
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,958
<font color="#00ffff">I'll get the water. One minute.</font>

849
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:07,625
<font color="#00ffff">Have some water.</font>

850
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,041
<font color="#00ffff">Shall we go to a hospital?</font>

851
01:06:12,666 --> 01:06:14,666
<font color="#00ffff">No, no.</font>

852
01:06:19,583 --> 01:06:21,000
<font color="#00ffff">Come, start the vehicle.</font>

853
01:06:21,208 --> 01:06:22,291
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, sir.</font>

854
01:06:32,041 --> 01:06:33,375
<font color="#00ffff">Come.</font>

855
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:45,875
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, look at her.</font>

856
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:46,958
<font color="#00ffff">She is pretty.</font>

857
01:06:49,166 --> 01:06:50,333
<font color="#00ffff">Come in, dear.</font>

858
01:06:53,166 --> 01:06:56,000
<font color="#00ffff">Children why are you playing here?
Go inside.</font>

859
01:06:56,083 --> 01:06:57,208
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, sister.</font>

860
01:06:57,291 --> 01:06:58,833
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, have the girls who went out

861
01:06:58,916 --> 01:06:59,916
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, sister.</font>

862
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:01,083
<font color="#00ffff">Okay.</font>

863
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:02,500
<font color="#00ffff">Swathi?</font>

864
01:07:02,583 --> 01:07:05,000
<font color="#00ffff">Those who have to go to Jubilee Hills,
have you sent them?</font>

865
01:07:05,208 --> 01:07:07,208
<font color="#00ffff">No, they are getting ready.</font>

866
01:07:07,541 --> 01:07:10,750
<font color="#00ffff">What! They are still getting ready?
Send them quickly.</font>

867
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:12,125
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, sister.</font>

868
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
<font color="#00ffff">Come in, dear.</font>

869
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:20,916
<font color="#00ffff">Where is my father?</font>

870
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:23,291
<font color="#00ffff">He'll be here soon. You come in.</font>

871
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
<font color="#00ffff">Padma?</font>

872
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:39,125
<font color="#00ffff">What... What happened?</font>

873
01:07:39,208 --> 01:07:40,208
<font color="#00ffff">This is Durga.</font>

874
01:07:40,291 --> 01:07:44,291
<font color="#00ffff">Our Sreenivasan's daughter.
She arrived this morning from the village.</font>

875
01:07:44,875 --> 01:07:46,250
<font color="#00ffff">Sreenivasan's daughter?</font>

876
01:07:46,958 --> 01:07:48,250
<font color="#00ffff">She is nice.</font>

877
01:07:48,416 --> 01:07:49,916
<font color="#00ffff">I am coming.</font>

878
01:07:57,208 --> 01:08:00,875
<font color="#00ffff">Nice, nice.
She came here at the right age.</font>

879
01:08:01,333 --> 01:08:05,791
<font color="#00ffff">Very nice.
She's young and pretty. Cute.</font>

880
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:12,500
<font color="#00ffff">Come, come inside.</font>

881
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:16,291
<font color="#00ffff">Go in.</font>

882
01:08:18,666 --> 01:08:19,666
<font color="#00ffff">Come.</font>

883
01:08:23,583 --> 01:08:26,375
<font color="#00ffff">Sister, where is my father?</font>

884
01:08:27,375 --> 01:08:29,291
<font color="#00ffff">He'll come. You come in.</font>

885
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:31,708
<font color="#00ffff">He'll come. You go, dear.</font>

886
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:42,916
<font color="#00ffff">Do you want some beauty treatment?</font>

887
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:45,250
<font color="#00ffff">No.</font>

888
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:48,125
<font color="#00ffff">Since you are here, we will get it done.</font>

889
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,666
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, we are next.</font>

890
01:08:54,875 --> 01:08:56,291
<font color="#00ffff">Hello, I'll call you later.</font>

891
01:08:56,666 --> 01:08:58,416
<font color="#00ffff">Sister, where is my father?</font>

892
01:08:59,041 --> 01:09:00,291
<font color="#00ffff">He is Mr. Reddy.</font>

893
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:04,583
<font color="#00ffff">From now on, he is
your father, mother, everything.</font>

894
01:09:05,583 --> 01:09:07,500
<font color="#00ffff">Wow! What a catch!</font>

895
01:09:07,666 --> 01:09:11,083
<font color="#00ffff">Sreenivasan's selection is fantastic.
Very nice!</font>

896
01:09:11,375 --> 01:09:12,500
<font color="#00ffff">Super!</font>

897
01:09:14,708 --> 01:09:16,166
<font color="#00ffff">Leave me.</font>

898
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:19,916
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, hold her.</font>

899
01:09:20,791 --> 01:09:24,500
<font color="#00ffff">Please, let me go.</font>

900
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:27,958
<font color="#00ffff">Please, let me go.</font>

901
01:09:36,458 --> 01:09:37,458
<font color="#00ffff">Please, let me go.</font>

902
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,125
<font color="#00ffff">You bitch.</font>

903
01:09:41,625 --> 01:09:44,000
<font color="#00ffff">I'll kill you if you try to escape.</font>

904
01:09:45,208 --> 01:09:46,708
<font color="#00ffff">Listen to me and keep quiet. Understand?</font>

905
01:09:46,791 --> 01:09:48,333
<font color="#00ffff">I'm not that kind of girl.</font>

906
01:09:51,166 --> 01:09:52,041
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, take her inside.</font>

907
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:53,333
<font color="#00ffff">I got eighth rank in the Intermediate...</font>

908
01:09:53,416 --> 01:09:54,708
<font color="#00ffff">I came here for a college interview.</font>

909
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:56,916
<font color="#00ffff">Please let me go, sir.</font>

910
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,291
<font color="#00ffff">Please. I'm not that sort of girl.</font>

911
01:10:10,375 --> 01:10:11,375
<font color="#00ffff">Shut up!</font>

912
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:14,000
<font color="#00ffff">I also came here to study.</font>

913
01:10:14,083 --> 01:10:15,666
<font color="#00ffff">I had got sixth rank in the Intermediate.</font>

914
01:10:16,166 --> 01:10:17,750
<font color="#00ffff">Now, look at me.</font>

915
01:10:17,875 --> 01:10:20,583
<font color="#00ffff">It's the same fellow
you are talking about,</font>

916
01:10:20,666 --> 01:10:21,958
<font color="#00ffff">that bastard Sreenivasan,</font>

917
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:23,375
<font color="#00ffff">he is only responsible for my plight.</font>

918
01:10:25,625 --> 01:10:26,625
<font color="#00ffff">Daddy?</font>

919
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,375
<font color="#00ffff">Come, get down, come.</font>

920
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:01,041
<font color="#00ffff">Get down, come.</font>

921
01:11:01,166 --> 01:11:03,666
<font color="#00ffff">Get down, come.</font>

922
01:11:06,708 --> 01:11:07,875
<font color="#00ffff">Leave me.</font>

923
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:15,250
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, catch her.</font>

924
01:11:21,541 --> 01:11:23,541
<font color="#00ffff">Catch her.</font>

925
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:31,125
<font color="#00ffff">I'm not that sort...</font>

926
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:34,958
<font color="#00ffff">Please leave me.</font>

927
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,375
<font color="#00ffff">Please leave me.</font>

928
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,416
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, bitch.
I'll kill you if you try to escape.</font>

929
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:55,166
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, bitch.
I'll kill you if you try to escape.</font>

930
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:57,916
<font color="#00ffff">Drag her inside.</font>

931
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:04,416
<font color="#00ffff">Leave me, please leave me.</font>

932
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:07,916
<font color="#00ffff">Leave me, please leave me.</font>

933
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,583
<font color="#00ffff">Leave me, please leave me.</font>

934
01:12:11,666 --> 01:12:14,291
<font color="#00ffff">Leave me.</font>

935
01:12:14,375 --> 01:12:15,750

936
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:19,125
<font color="#00ffff">Leave me.</font>

937
01:12:19,875 --> 01:12:21,500
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, bitch. Will you try to escape?</font>

938
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:01,708
<font color="#00ffff">Come, please come. How are you, sir?</font>

939
01:13:01,791 --> 01:13:03,208
<font color="#00ffff">I'm fine.</font>

940
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:04,875
<font color="#00ffff">These are the new ones that I mentioned.</font>

941
01:13:06,541 --> 01:13:08,291
<font color="#00ffff">The old batch is there.</font>

942
01:13:08,583 --> 01:13:12,166
<font color="#00ffff">I have kept the new girl here.</font>

943
01:13:15,541 --> 01:13:17,291
<font color="#00ffff">What you've started already?</font>

944
01:13:18,791 --> 01:13:21,583
<font color="#00ffff">She is very good... Go and see.</font>

945
01:13:23,458 --> 01:13:24,833
<font color="#00ffff">I will see.</font>

946
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,208
<font color="#00ffff">Hi, dear! How are you?</font>

947
01:13:35,458 --> 01:13:38,458
<font color="#00ffff">How is this place?
Is everything okay here?</font>

948
01:14:20,708 --> 01:14:22,625
<font color="#00ffff">One, two, three...</font>

949
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:23,750
<font color="#00ffff">How long will you count?</font>

950
01:14:23,833 --> 01:14:25,458
<font color="#00ffff">-Almost done, sister.
-No, no, that's not enough.</font>

951
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:27,416
<font color="#00ffff">She is brand-new and young.</font>

952
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,708
<font color="#00ffff">Is she the one?</font>

953
01:14:28,791 --> 01:14:30,375
<font color="#00ffff">I said I will give you tomorrow.</font>

954
01:14:30,458 --> 01:14:32,375
<font color="#00ffff">You take it or leave it.</font>

955
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:33,750
<font color="#00ffff">It's nice, intoxicating.</font>

956
01:14:33,833 --> 01:14:35,416
<font color="#00ffff">Keep this.
I'll see you again, my dear girl.</font>

957
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
<font color="#00ffff">You go inside. I will send her.</font>

958
01:14:54,208 --> 01:14:56,166
<font color="#00ffff">Hey, go inside.</font>

959
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:58,541
<font color="#00ffff">How much time, sister? Send her fast.</font>

960
01:14:58,625 --> 01:14:59,625
<font color="#00ffff">You go inside, man.</font>

961
01:14:59,708 --> 01:15:00,708
<font color="#00ffff">Okay.</font>

962
01:15:02,166 --> 01:15:03,166
<font color="#00ffff">Come on.</font>

963
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,416
<font color="#00ffff">Sister, it's painful.</font>

964
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,291
<font color="#00ffff">It is very painful.</font>

965
01:15:14,625 --> 01:15:16,041
<font color="#00ffff">Please tell them to leave me.</font>

966
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:22,833
<font color="#00ffff">I'm not that sort of girl.</font>

967
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
<font color="#00ffff">Sister... I'm not able to bear it.</font>

968
01:15:29,041 --> 01:15:30,958
<font color="#00ffff">Sister... I'm not able to bear it.</font>

969

970
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:41,916

01:20:17,666 --> 01:20:22,333
<font color="#00ffff">No way out
Don't know which way to take</font>

1011
01:20:22,416 --> 01:20:24,708
<font color="#00ffff">Giving up before destiny</font>

1012
01:20:26,708 --> 01:20:30,375
<font color="#00ffff">All tender emotions of human relations
has been wiped out forever</font>

1013
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:34,250
<font color="#00ffff">The world burns into ashes
by the fire of this truth</font>

1014
01:20:34,625 --> 01:20:37,666
<font color="#00ffff">No matter how much one pleads
Nobody can escape this funeral pyre</font>

1015
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:40,375
<font color="#00ffff">Seeing your plight</font>

1016
01:20:40,458 --> 01:20:45,708
<font color="#00ffff">The world looks at the sky for solace</font>

1017
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:54,583
<font color="#00ffff">The hearts around are brimming with tears</font>

1018
01:20:57,625 --> 01:21:00,583
<font color="#00ffff">What kind of war is this?</font>

1019
01:21:00,666 --> 01:21:04,583
<font color="#00ffff">What kind of debt is this?
How will it be repaid?</font>

1020
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:08,166
<font color="#00ffff">What kind of poison is this?</font>

1021
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:12,083
<font color="#00ffff">What kind of journey is this?
When will all this end?</font>

1022
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:16,375
<font color="#00ffff">Time has given a wound
An incurable one</font>

1023
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:32,333
<font color="#00ffff">Where is sister?</font>

1024
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:33,458
<font color="#00ffff">Inside.</font>

1025
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:39,416
<font color="#00ffff">Sister, the girls sent to Mohan Reddy...</font>

1026
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,666
<font color="#00ffff">Seems there was some problem.</font>

1027
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:44,500
<font color="#00ffff">That fellow, Murugan,
is bringing them back.</font>

1028
01:21:44,583 --> 01:21:47,250
<font color="#00ffff">Let him come, I'll find out from him.</font>

1029
01:21:47,833 --> 01:21:49,750
<font color="#00ffff">How come this way.</font>

1030
01:21:50,625 --> 01:21:51,625
<font color="#00ffff">Well...</font>

1031
01:21:51,708 --> 01:21:55,833
<font color="#00ffff">What, Murugan, why are they back so soon?</font>

1032
01:21:55,958 --> 01:22:00,708
<font color="#00ffff">Sister, that was a big gang of youngsters.</font>

1033
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,125
<font color="#00ffff">Ten of them.
The girls will be in no shape.</font>

1034
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:06,208
<font color="#00ffff">They won't even pay up properly.</font>

1035
01:22:08,208 --> 01:22:09,208
<font color="#00ffff">So what else?</font>

1036
01:22:09,875 --> 01:22:13,708
<font color="#00ffff">Sister, my daughter is missing.</font>

1037
01:22:13,791 --> 01:22:15,791
<font color="#00ffff">It's been ten days already.</font>

1038
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:20,666
<font color="#00ffff">Daughter or a new find?</font>

1039
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:26,250
<font color="#00ffff">Heard that you're doing business
on your own.</font>

1040
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:28,333
<font color="#00ffff">That's why I asked.</font>

1041
01:22:30,083 --> 01:22:32,000
<font color="#00ffff">She is my darling daughter, sister.</font>

1042
01:22:32,083 --> 01:22:34,000
<font color="#00ffff">Came to the city for a college interview.</font>

1043
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:36,000
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, okay. I am convinced.</font>

1044
01:22:36,083 --> 01:22:38,041
<font color="#00ffff">She is your daughter.</font>

1045
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,833
<font color="#00ffff">But nobody brought her here.</font>

1046
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:45,416
<font color="#00ffff">What, Sarala,
has anyone brought a "darling girl" here?</font>

1047
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:46,500
<font color="#00ffff">No, sister.</font>

1048
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:56,791
<font color="#00ffff">Darling daughter...
Haven't I heard that before!</font>

1049
01:22:59,291 --> 01:23:02,333
<font color="#00ffff">That's enough, Sreenivasan.
Look, how his face has fallen.</font>

1050
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
<font color="#00ffff">Hello, where are you?</font>

1051
01:23:22,083 --> 01:23:24,083
<font color="#00ffff">Are you both going round the city?</font>

1052
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:27,958
<font color="#00ffff">Is Durga so busy that she
can't speak to me even for a minute?</font>

1053
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:30,666
<font color="#00ffff">Where is she? Give the phone to her.</font>

1054
01:23:32,875 --> 01:23:34,875
<font color="#00ffff">She is watching a film in IMAX.</font>

1055
01:23:35,125 --> 01:23:37,041
<font color="#00ffff">I just came out to talk to you.</font>

1056
01:23:37,125 --> 01:23:38,916
<font color="#00ffff">I will make her call you later.</font>

1057
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
<font color="#00ffff">It's been ten days
since I last heard her voice.</font>

1058
01:23:42,125 --> 01:23:45,541
<font color="#00ffff">Whenever I have called
I couldn't speak to her.</font>

1059
01:23:45,958 --> 01:23:49,125
<font color="#00ffff">She seemed to have forgotten me
after coming there.</font>

1060
01:23:49,333 --> 01:23:53,333
<font color="#00ffff">You don't get worried.
I'll make her call you later, okay?</font>

1061
01:24:18,625 --> 01:24:19,625
<font color="#00ffff">Brother...</font>

1062
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:23,375
<font color="#00ffff">What happened?</font>

1063
01:24:25,583 --> 01:24:26,583
<font color="#00ffff">I've searched everywhere.</font>

1064
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,500
<font color="#00ffff">No place is left now to search.</font>

1065
01:24:30,916 --> 01:24:32,166
<font color="#00ffff">My darling.</font>

1066
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:38,583
<font color="#00ffff">It was my mistake to leave her alone
in the hotel.</font>

1067
01:24:38,958 --> 01:24:41,833
<font color="#00ffff">Brother, is she really your daughter?</font>

1068
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:45,250
<font color="#00ffff">Which hotel was it?</font>

1069
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:47,208
<font color="#00ffff">Hotel Royal.</font>

1070
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:52,458
<font color="#00ffff">Brother... Big eyes, long hair.</font>

1071
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:55,750
<font color="#00ffff">Have you seen her?</font>

1072
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:57,500
<font color="#00ffff">Look at this photo.</font>

1073
01:24:58,208 --> 01:25:00,125
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, she is the one.</font>

1074
01:25:00,208 --> 01:25:01,791
<font color="#00ffff">I saw her today at Ameerpet Padma's house.</font>

1075
01:25:02,958 --> 01:25:05,875
<font color="#00ffff">They told me that they picked her up
from Hotel Royal.</font>

1076
01:25:07,125 --> 01:25:08,125
<font color="#00ffff">At Padma's place?</font>

1077
01:25:08,458 --> 01:25:09,750
<font color="#00ffff">Take me to Ameerpet.</font>

1078
01:25:09,833 --> 01:25:10,958
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, sir.</font>

1079
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
<font color="#00ffff">Turn.</font>

1080
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:23,666
<font color="#00ffff">Give me that lipstick.</font>

1081
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:26,833
<font color="#00ffff">Enough, you have put enough.
Give it to me.</font>

1082
01:25:32,166 --> 01:25:33,166
<font color="#00ffff">Close your mouth.</font>

1083
01:25:33,916 --> 01:25:35,458
<font color="#00ffff">What are you girls looking at?</font>

1084
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:37,291
<font color="#00ffff">Get ready soon.</font>

1085
01:25:37,583 --> 01:25:39,166
<font color="#00ffff">All these are newcomer's fancies.</font>

1086
01:25:39,583 --> 01:25:41,458
<font color="#00ffff">Afterwards she will become like one of us.</font>

1087
01:25:43,625 --> 01:25:46,625
<font color="#00ffff">Whores, why are you delaying?
Get ready soon.</font>

1088
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
<font color="#00ffff">Don't cry.</font>

1089
01:26:05,166 --> 01:26:07,166
<font color="#00ffff">Move. Move.</font>

1090
01:26:08,458 --> 01:26:11,666
<font color="#00ffff">Smile. Smile.</font>

1091
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:13,916
<font color="#00ffff">Get up, get up.</font>

1092
01:26:15,625 --> 01:26:17,625
<font color="#00ffff">Isn't she looking super now?</font>

1093
01:26:21,291 --> 01:26:22,375
<font color="#00ffff">Smile.</font>

1094
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:33,916
<font color="#00ffff">I'll kill you if you try
anything silly there.</font>

1095
01:26:38,583 --> 01:26:42,833
<font color="#00ffff">Keep an eye on this bitch.
She acts too smart.</font>

1096
01:26:43,041 --> 01:26:44,416
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, sir.</font>

1097
01:26:46,625 --> 01:26:47,625
<font color="#00ffff">Come, whores. It's getting late. Move!</font>

1098
01:26:47,708 --> 01:26:48,833
<font color="#00ffff">Yes, coming.</font>

1099
01:26:49,625 --> 01:26:51,333
<font color="#00ffff">What the hell are you doing there?
Come fast.</font>

1100
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:54,125
<font color="#00ffff">Coming, sister.</font>

1101
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:56,208
<font color="#00ffff">Get in.</font>

1102
01:26:56,791 --> 01:26:57,875
<font color="#00ffff">Come, get in.</font>

1103
01:27:18,333 --> 01:27:22,791
<font color="#00ffff">Daddy... Daddy!</font>

1104
01:27:24,833 --> 01:27:26,500
<font color="#00ffff">Daddy... Daddy!</font>

1105
01:27:37,541 --> 01:27:38,875
<font color="#00ffff">Go via Vijaya Nagar colony.</font>

1106
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:56,041
<font color="#00ffff">Hello. Sure, sure.
Will definitely come. Okay, okay.</font>

1107
01:27:56,125 --> 01:27:59,250
<font color="#00ffff">Sir, sir.</font>

1108
01:28:01,125 --> 01:28:03,708
<font color="#00ffff">Who is it? Oh, Sreenivasan!
Is all your work done?</font>

1109
01:28:03,875 --> 01:28:07,833
<font color="#00ffff">Sir. My girl, my daughter.
Please let go of her.</font>

1110
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:09,541
<font color="#00ffff">Which girl?</font>

1111
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:12,916
<font color="#00ffff">My daughter, Durga.
She came here for an interview.</font>

1112
01:28:13,541 --> 01:28:16,166
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, that girl.
She has gone to the interview, hasn't she?</font>

1113
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:19,208
<font color="#00ffff">If she gets admission,</font>

1114
01:28:19,291 --> 01:28:23,500
<font color="#00ffff">we'll get an excellent business deal
worked out in the Middle East.</font>

1115
01:28:24,375 --> 01:28:25,875
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, we'll meet again.</font>

1116
01:28:25,958 --> 01:28:28,291
<font color="#00ffff">Come tomorrow morning
and take the payment.</font>

1117
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,208
<font color="#00ffff">Sir, she is my daughter.
My only daughter, sir.</font>

1118
01:28:33,291 --> 01:28:35,041
<font color="#00ffff">Please let her go.</font>

1119
01:28:35,125 --> 01:28:39,125
<font color="#00ffff">Please show pity on me, sir.
Please let her go, sir. Sir...</font>

1120
01:29:04,083 --> 01:29:09,375
<font color="#00ffff">Don't worry, brother. Let me see if I can
get in somehow. I'm with you.</font>

1121
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,041
<font color="#00ffff">-Bhaskar!
-Who's that?</font>

1122
01:29:12,125 --> 01:29:13,416
<font color="#00ffff">-It's me, brother.
-Oh, Murugan.</font>

1123
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:14,916
<font color="#00ffff">Come in.</font>

1124
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,208
<font color="#00ffff">Brother, you see.</font>

1125
01:29:22,541 --> 01:29:23,583
<font color="#00ffff">What happened?</font>

1126
01:29:25,166 --> 01:29:27,166
<font color="#00ffff">I deserve this punishment.</font>

1127
01:29:30,833 --> 01:29:36,083
<font color="#00ffff">How many parents must've been ruined
because of me? Oh, God!</font>

1128
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:40,041
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, brother, see you later.</font>

1129
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:41,125
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, okay.</font>

1130
01:29:44,125 --> 01:29:47,208
<font color="#00ffff">Brother, they've taken the girl away.</font>

1131
01:29:47,375 --> 01:29:49,541
<font color="#00ffff">To some resort on the Vijayawada road.</font>

1132
01:29:49,625 --> 01:29:51,166
<font color="#00ffff">I'm told Padma took her.
Come quickly, we'll go.</font>

1133
01:29:52,083 --> 01:29:53,416
<font color="#00ffff">Start the vehicle.</font>

1134
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:54,666
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, sir.</font>

1135
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
<font color="#00ffff">Padma is not taking the call.</font>

1136
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:34,291
<font color="#00ffff">God, please save my daughter!</font>

1137
01:30:39,458 --> 01:30:41,416
<font color="#00ffff">Don't ruin your makeup by crying.</font>

1138
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:44,083
<font color="#00ffff">It's a Dubai customer. Very rich.</font>

1139
01:30:45,666 --> 01:30:48,750
<font color="#00ffff">If you do anything silly there,</font>

1140
01:30:48,833 --> 01:30:52,541
<font color="#00ffff">Reddy will not spare you.
He'll kill you. Mind it.</font>

1141
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:59,875
<font color="#00ffff">Stop crying. I've gone through worse.</font>

1142
01:30:59,958 --> 01:31:03,000
<font color="#00ffff">They slashed me with razors when
I did something silly like you.</font>

1143
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,958
<font color="#00ffff">Then there are so many wounds,
that I can't show...</font>

1144
01:31:07,041 --> 01:31:09,583
<font color="#00ffff">Who should I tell all that to?</font>

1145
01:31:12,666 --> 01:31:15,291
<font color="#00ffff">Be obedient for your own good.</font>

1146
01:31:17,166 --> 01:31:19,333
<font color="#00ffff">Looks like things have gone
out of our hands.</font>

1147
01:31:19,416 --> 01:31:22,958
<font color="#00ffff">Maybe it's a good idea
to inform the police.</font>

1148
01:31:23,458 --> 01:31:27,583
<font color="#00ffff">Don't lose hope, brother.
I'll try Padma's number once.</font>

1149
01:31:32,916 --> 01:31:34,208
<font color="#00ffff">Yes? What do you want?</font>

1150
01:31:34,666 --> 01:31:38,250
<font color="#00ffff">Sister, I need some money, urgently.</font>

1151
01:31:39,375 --> 01:31:40,916
<font color="#00ffff">Okay. Do one thing, come tomorrow morning.</font>

01:49:26,625 --> 01:49:27,708
<font color="#00ffff">Drink.</font>

1302
01:49:35,625 --> 01:49:36,916
<font color="#00ffff">Eat it.</font>

1303
01:49:37,083 --> 01:49:38,083
<font color="#00ffff">Eat.</font>

1304
01:49:43,166 --> 01:49:45,291
<font color="#00ffff">How many days has she been?</font>

1305
01:49:45,375 --> 01:49:46,583
<font color="#00ffff">It's been four days.</font>

1306
01:49:47,041 --> 01:49:48,291
<font color="#00ffff">Super...</font>

1307
01:49:48,583 --> 01:49:50,583
<font color="#00ffff">Leave me, sister.</font>

1308
01:49:51,333 --> 01:49:53,333
<font color="#00ffff">She is my darling daughter.</font>

1309
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:24,416
<font color="#00ffff">Go. I'll come later.</font>

1310
01:51:22,375 --> 01:51:24,208
<font color="#00ffff">No, Chandini.</font>

1311
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:27,958
<font color="#00ffff">Father and daughter seem to be
having a gala time in Hyderabad.</font>

1312
01:51:28,125 --> 01:51:30,625
<font color="#00ffff">If I call, they are not finding time
to even talk to me!</font>

1313
01:51:31,208 --> 01:51:35,708
<font color="#00ffff">It's been ten days since I spoke to her.
The house looks empty without her.</font>

1314
01:51:35,916 --> 01:51:39,083
<font color="#00ffff">You have the number, don't you?
Call her once.</font>

1315
01:51:40,291 --> 01:51:42,708
<font color="#00ffff">No, she didn't tell me anything.
If she gets admission,</font>

1316
01:51:42,791 --> 01:51:45,083
<font color="#00ffff">she might come before the classes start.</font>

1317
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:51,291
<font color="#00ffff">Now I'm alone.
Tomorrow my grandmother may come.</font>

1318
01:51:51,875 --> 01:51:56,291
<font color="#00ffff">You are fine, aren't you?
Give my regards to everyone. Okay, bye.</font>

1319
01:52:04,750 --> 01:52:07,333
<font color="#00ffff">Durga, my dear! You are back!</font>

1320
01:52:08,416 --> 01:52:10,416
<font color="#00ffff">What happened?
What happened to you?</font>

1321
01:52:11,083 --> 01:52:13,708
<font color="#00ffff">You've lost so much weight!</font>

1322
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:18,875
<font color="#00ffff">Where is your dad?</font>

1323
01:52:20,750 --> 01:52:22,041
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, you had a fight again?</font>

1324
01:52:23,333 --> 01:52:26,208
<font color="#00ffff">I'm told both you and your father
were having a great time in Hyderabad.</font>

1325
01:52:27,083 --> 01:52:31,166
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, okay. I'll get some tea.
Will listen to all the stories later.</font>

1326
01:54:20,125 --> 01:54:21,416
<font color="#00ffff">So, you've also arrived!</font>

1327
01:54:22,208 --> 01:54:26,333
<font color="#00ffff">Haven't I told you not to scold her?</font>

1328
01:54:27,875 --> 01:54:29,708
<font color="#00ffff">Okay, all that later.</font>

1329
01:54:29,791 --> 01:54:31,000
<font color="#00ffff">I'll get you some tea.</font>

1330
01:54:31,083 --> 01:54:32,916
<font color="#00ffff">I'll keep the hot water ready for bath.
Change and come.</font>

1331
01:55:13,041 --> 01:55:14,291
<font color="#00ffff">Keep your hands off me.</font>

1332
01:55:15,166 --> 01:55:18,375
<font color="#00ffff">No. You see, it's not like that.</font>

1333
01:57:19,791 --> 01:57:21,250
<font color="#00ffff">Listen, here is your tea.</font>

1334
01:57:22,708 --> 01:57:24,583
<font color="#00ffff">Durga, where is your father?</font>

1335
01:57:25,208 --> 01:57:27,125
<font color="#00ffff">She is another character!</font>

1336
01:57:27,458 --> 01:57:31,791
<font color="#00ffff">Where are you?
The tea is getting cold.</font>

1337
01:57:35,333 --> 01:57:40,875
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, God! What have you done?</font>

1338
01:57:43,041 --> 01:57:45,750
<font color="#00ffff">Durga! Your father...</font>

1339
01:57:57,666 --> 01:58:00,458
<font color="#00ffff">Why have you done this? Oh, God!</font>

1340
01:58:01,291 --> 01:58:06,833
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, my father! Why this?</font>

1341
01:58:06,916 --> 01:58:12,500
<font color="#00ffff">Is it because I remained as a puppet
in the society?</font>

1342
01:58:13,833 --> 01:58:16,833
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, my father! Why this?</font>

1343
01:58:16,916 --> 01:58:22,750
<font color="#00ffff">Is it because I am your lovely doll and
you safeguarded me like your eyeball?</font>

1344
01:58:26,750 --> 01:58:30,958
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, my father! Why this?</font>

1345
01:58:31,041 --> 01:58:36,958
<font color="#00ffff">Is it because I am your lovely doll and
you safeguarded me like your eyeball?</font>

1346
01:58:39,416 --> 01:58:45,291
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, my father! Why this?</font>

1347
01:58:45,375 --> 01:58:51,000
<font color="#00ffff">Is it because I blossomed like a lotus
in the pond in your care?</font>

1348
01:58:55,458 --> 01:59:01,666
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, my father! Why this?</font>

1349
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:04,666
<font color="#00ffff">Is it because you have realised
at least now</font>

1350
01:59:04,750 --> 01:59:07,958
<font color="#00ffff">That you too have your own girl child?</font>

1351
02:00:03,250 --> 02:00:08,833
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, my father! Why this?</font>

1352
02:00:08,916 --> 02:00:14,166
<font color="#00ffff">Is it because I remained as a puppet
in the society?</font>

1353
02:00:18,916 --> 02:00:24,333
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, my father! Why this?</font>

1354
02:00:24,416 --> 02:00:29,625
<font color="#00ffff">Is it because I remained as a puppet
in the society?</font>

1355
02:00:32,375 --> 02:00:37,083
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, my father! Why this?</font>

1356
02:00:37,166 --> 02:00:43,458
<font color="#00ffff">Is it because I am your lovely doll
and you safeguarded me like your eyeball?</font>

1357
02:00:44,666 --> 02:00:49,750
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, my father! Why this?</font>

1358
02:00:49,833 --> 02:00:55,416
<font color="#00ffff">Is it because I made you forget all
your grievances and shined your dreams?</font>

1359
02:00:56,833 --> 02:01:02,625
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, my father! Why this?</font>

1360
02:01:02,708 --> 02:01:07,750
<font color="#00ffff">Is it because I blossomed like a lotus
in the pond in your care?</font>

1361
02:01:16,375 --> 02:01:22,666
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, my father! Why this?</font>

1362
02:01:23,541 --> 02:01:26,958
<font color="#00ffff">Is it because you
have realised at least now</font>

1363
02:01:27,041 --> 02:01:30,375
<font color="#00ffff">That you too have your own girl child?</font>
