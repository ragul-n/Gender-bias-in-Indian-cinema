2
00:01:36,343 --> 00:01:38,641
Take one..

3
00:01:45,452 --> 00:01:46,350
Action.

4
00:03:02,395 --> 00:03:04,295
Come on.

5
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:10,562
Changezi.
My name's BBM.

6
00:03:10,637 --> 00:03:14,505
Brij Bansi Mishra. But I
am in no mood to get my kicked.

7
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:16,900
These two work for Sooraj.

8
00:03:16,977 --> 00:03:19,275
That's Salim and that one's Gangu.

9
00:03:19,312 --> 00:03:20,904
Why did you bring them here?

10
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:24,940
Because we're going to use
them as baits to lure him here.

11
00:03:25,018 --> 00:03:26,645
- Get that?
- Hey BBM...

12
00:03:26,853 --> 00:03:29,287
We sent a BBM too... to Suraj.

13
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:31,290
Enough of your 'Sing-song'.

14
00:03:31,324 --> 00:03:33,986
He's going to ring
your bell 'ding-dong'.

15
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:27,837
Sooraj! We've found BBM sir.

16
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:02,747
Run, Brij.

17
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:10,354
Sooraj..

18
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:15,551
..do you think you're a hero?

19
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:16,554
No!

20
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,030
Changezi, I have my doubts.

21
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:52,297
If you like gambling, then..

22
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:54,826
..you should pay
up like a good sport.

23
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:57,661
Let's go, BBM.

24
00:05:57,737 --> 00:05:59,034
Sooraj!

25
00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:02,239
You've got some good punch lines.

26
00:06:02,475 --> 00:06:04,500
Let's test your punch as well.

27
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:55,893
Changezi bhai,
your men are getting beaten up.

28
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:00,865
And you're comfortably
eating chicken.

29
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:02,933
Just saying.

30
00:07:17,684 --> 00:07:20,676
When Changezi stands
up... he's taller than the world.

31
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,790
Salim... Ibrahim uncle's
daughter is getting married.

32
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,350
So deliver 300,000 Rs to him.

33
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:03,827
An Rathodi,...what was
the name of that boy..

34
00:08:03,897 --> 00:08:05,421
..we promised to help for his MBA?

35
00:08:05,498 --> 00:08:07,898
- Dinesh.
- Yeah. Give him 200,000 Rs.

36
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:16,265
Why are you abusing me?

37
00:08:16,743 --> 00:08:17,710
What damage?

38
00:08:17,777 --> 00:08:19,267
He's right.

39
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:22,542
We mean nothing to you, don't we?

40
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:24,583
Sooraj, you do this all the time.

41
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:27,279
Right, you're distributing
our hard-earned money.

42
00:08:27,353 --> 00:08:29,651
Sooraj, we want our share.

43
00:08:29,722 --> 00:08:31,246
You Bengali.

44
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,885
Did you invest this money that
now you're asking for your share?

45
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,824
What will you do with money?

46
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:37,590
- We'll party.
- You promised us.

47
00:08:37,664 --> 00:08:38,653
Yes. Sooraj.

48
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,589
What do you say, Mangya?

49
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:44,827
Party at a up-market place.

50
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:46,030
Let's go.

51
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:54,712
Sorry guys, I am late.

52
00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:56,942
But that Abhi, he's such a dimwit.

53
00:08:57,016 --> 00:09:00,281
I said it's over between us. "Where
were you? Who were you with?"

54
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:03,480
I told him it's over between us.

55
00:09:03,556 --> 00:09:04,989
You mean you broke up with him.

56
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:06,954
So now he's your ex-boyfriend.

57
00:09:06,993 --> 00:09:09,223
Yes. Now I'm going
to Paris in a month..

58
00:09:09,863 --> 00:09:11,763
..and I don't want
any excess baggage along.

59
00:09:11,798 --> 00:09:14,494
I just want to be free.

60
00:09:29,849 --> 00:09:31,680
Let's take a bathroom selfie, guys.

61
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,255
Come on, we need a refill.

62
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:41,885
I am going to miss you.

63
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:43,758
Let's take a selfie.

64
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:04,376
Look what he is doing?

65
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:08,010
- Who's that crazy guy?
- Loser!

66
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:09,619
What a loser!

67
00:10:33,513 --> 00:10:35,947
"We're the King of Hearts..."

68
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:38,074
"we love to enjoy."

69
00:10:38,318 --> 00:10:40,411
"We sit on our car's bonnet..."

70
00:10:40,486 --> 00:10:42,351
"and have a feast."

71
00:10:42,422 --> 00:10:44,720
"We're the King of Hearts..."

72
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,782
"we love to enjoy."

73
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:49,054
"We sit on our car's bonnet..."

74
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:51,559
"and have a feast."

75
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:54,460
"Our demands are unique."

76
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:56,729
"and wear torn jeans."

77
00:10:56,803 --> 00:11:00,330
"And let our shirt
stay unbuttoned."

78
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:04,543
"we're the legends
of this dancing-floor."

79
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,601
"We can make you sway..."

80
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,704
"because we're the
heroes of this realm."

81
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:11,272
"Girls can't dance like this..."

82
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:13,285
"we're the legends
of dancing-floor."

83
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:15,617
"We can make you sway..."

84
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:17,747
"because we're the
heroes of this realm."

85
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:23,393
"We're the legends
of the dance-floor."

86
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,565
"We make the speaker
go "Thump-Thump-Thump."

87
00:11:57,597 --> 00:12:00,760
"Show me... what you got."

88
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:03,765
"You might have a Mercedes."

89
00:12:03,903 --> 00:12:06,269
"But I have a cycle."

90
00:12:06,305 --> 00:12:08,773
"You're the club's Shakira."

91
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:10,706
"I am the neighborhood Michael."

92
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,607
"You might have a Mercedes."

93
00:12:12,678 --> 00:12:14,839
"But I have a cycle."

94
00:12:14,914 --> 00:12:16,973
"You're the club's Shakira."

95
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,314
"I am the neighborhood Michael."

96
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:22,414
"All your brands are fake."

97
00:12:22,488 --> 00:12:24,513
"Why do you want to be a wannabe?"

98
00:12:24,657 --> 00:12:27,888
"You local boys don't know anything
about international rhythm."

99
00:12:28,027 --> 00:12:30,291
"Girls can't dance like this..."

100
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:32,320
"we're the legends
of the dancing-floor."

101
00:12:32,398 --> 00:12:34,593
"We can make you sway..."

102
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,760
"because we're the
heroes of this realm."

103
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:53,510
"Your turn."

104
00:12:54,053 --> 00:12:54,781
"What you got."

105
00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:56,617
"I am the original."

106
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:58,987
"And you're the cheap rip-off."

107
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:03,017
"My attitude's hotter...
than your dancing."

108
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:05,457
"I am the original."

109
00:13:05,598 --> 00:13:07,589
"And you're the cheap rip-off."

110
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:11,603
"My attitude's hotter...
than your dancing."

111
00:13:11,904 --> 00:13:14,839
"Don't think I'm a duffer."

112
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:16,966
"I am of the highest caliber."

113
00:13:17,043 --> 00:13:20,570
"My dance moves are
hotter than my words."

114
00:13:20,646 --> 00:13:22,807
"Boys can't dance like this..."

115
00:13:22,882 --> 00:13:24,941
"we're the legends
of the dancing floor."

116
00:13:25,017 --> 00:13:27,281
"Because when we sway..."

117
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,413
"we make the speakers Thump."

118
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:31,480
"Girls can't dance like this..."

119
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:33,616
"we're the legends
the dancing-floor."

120
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:35,923
"We can make you sway..."

121
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:38,327
"because we're the
heroes of this realm."

122
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,840
I've been trying to
call you for two hours..

123
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:00,078
..and you're partying out here.

124
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:01,384
Let go.

125
00:14:02,555 --> 00:14:03,681
Leave me.

126
00:14:03,756 --> 00:14:06,919
- We've broken up, don't you understand?
- I will decide that.

127
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,529
Stay away, I am going to call my dad.
You get that.

128
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:12,521
Leave me.

129
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:18,461
Let her go.

130
00:14:20,473 --> 00:14:21,462
Let her go.

131
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:25,310
Hey... stop the music.

132
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:27,772
Security, close the exit door!

133
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:30,748
Manager, call the ambulance!

134
00:14:30,816 --> 00:14:32,408
I am going to make him...

135
00:14:51,304 --> 00:14:53,033
This going to be really messy.

136
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,298
Hey, stop... stop yo...

137
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:24,893
Bloody rascal...

138
00:15:24,971 --> 00:15:27,371
Wait... wait...

139
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:41,647
Excuse me.

140
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:46,883
Thank you.

141
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:48,816
Thank you... See.

142
00:15:56,335 --> 00:15:57,734
I told you
it's going to be a big mess.

143
00:15:57,803 --> 00:15:58,895
Let's go.

144
00:16:05,311 --> 00:16:07,404
You should be all suspended.

145
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,880
How could you let her go alone?

146
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:12,816
- Sir, you..
- I said Radha won't go anywhere alone.

147
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:13,817
Speak up now.

148
00:16:13,886 --> 00:16:15,285
- Dheeraj.
- What?

149
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:18,547
Yes... Dad.

150
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:21,383
Tell me what happened?

151
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:23,755
- Ruchi. Ruchi.
- Baby.

152
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:24,853
- What happened?
- She's getting pains.

153
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,363
Is it time? Shall we go?

154
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:27,524
- Dad...
- Help me.

155
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,363
Dad, call the ambulance.

156
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:31,300
Dad... baby coming.

157
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,928
Dad, baby's here.

158
00:16:34,273 --> 00:16:35,672
Dad..

159
00:16:36,642 --> 00:16:38,542
Hi, mom-dad. What's up?

160
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:39,709
What's up?

161
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:41,303
Do you know how worried dad was?

162
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:43,882
- But I did tell him.
- This won't do.

163
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:46,713
You broke everyone's trust.

164
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:48,014
- Mr. Dheeraj.
- Yes.

165
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:49,515
You're a pathetic actor.

166
00:16:49,588 --> 00:16:50,782
- What?
- Yes.

167
00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:52,785
And you too.

168
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,049
And you... stop being a drama queen.

169
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:56,318
Dad.

170
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:58,028
Dad, chill.

171
00:16:58,497 --> 00:17:00,795
Take a look at these security guys.

172
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:04,233
Whenever my friends see them, my
friends say here comes the Cavalry.

173
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:07,398
- This is wrong.
- No, dad.

174
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:09,468
If you want me to get security..

175
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:12,443
..then atleast get me some cooler,
hipper guys.

176
00:17:14,013 --> 00:17:16,743
You can all go.
Thank you very much.

177
00:17:18,484 --> 00:17:20,008
- Dad.
- What's all this?

178
00:17:20,252 --> 00:17:21,913
Sorry.

179
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:25,553
I promise I'll keep
security from tomorrow.

180
00:17:25,725 --> 00:17:26,851
Don't be mad.

181
00:17:26,926 --> 00:17:29,292
And anyway,
I am the IG's daughter.

182
00:17:29,362 --> 00:17:31,626
I am not scared of
some Pasha or anyone else.

183
00:17:32,665 --> 00:17:35,862
"This is an important
day for IG Srikant Mathur."

184
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:36,993
"The Mumbai High Court..."

185
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:38,258
"will hear the
charge-sheet on the..."

186
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:40,829
"PWD Minister Suryakant
Pasha-Ranade case."

187
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,899
"Pasha is accused for the murder
of noted journalist Samay Patil."

188
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:47,275
"And Srikant Mathur has
put 40 years of his experience..."

189
00:17:47,313 --> 00:17:49,941
"at stake for this case."

190
00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:52,375
"Can Pasha escape?"

191
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,809
Let's go.

192
00:17:57,423 --> 00:17:59,288
We've just confirmed
that the Mumbai High-Court..

193
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:02,556
..has issued a section 302 against
Pasha for 1st Degree murder.

194
00:18:02,962 --> 00:18:06,625
The next hearing on this
case will be on 18th February.

195
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:09,758
Sir, Pasha says that
you're falsely accusing him.

196
00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:10,699
Is it true?

197
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,237
Do you think the court
will pass judgment..

198
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:14,705
..on Pasha or my word?

199
00:18:15,674 --> 00:18:19,235
The court wants evidence,
which the Mumbai Police has.

200
00:18:19,512 --> 00:18:21,446
And we'll present it on the 18th.

201
00:18:21,514 --> 00:18:22,446
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

202
00:18:22,515 --> 00:18:23,004
Come.

203
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:24,511
Sir, one more question..

204
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,880
Sir... please, sir..

205
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,558
Sir..

206
00:18:38,764 --> 00:18:41,358
Sir... please, sir..

207
00:18:41,434 --> 00:18:42,924
A senior journalist was murdered.

208
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:44,765
And Mumbai Police's
IG Srikant Mathur..

209
00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:46,361
..is investigating
this case personally.

210
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:50,034
IG Srikant Mathur... is
a very capable officer.

211
00:18:50,443 --> 00:18:51,933
And a highly decorated officer too.

212
00:18:52,278 --> 00:18:54,405
He wants to retire with a bang.

213
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:58,012
But... the case he chose is wrong.

214
00:18:58,551 --> 00:19:01,645
There is no evidence against
me in the Samay Patil murder case.

215
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:03,387
Jay Hind.

216
00:19:06,225 --> 00:19:08,693
I just don't understand
what that IG has!

217
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,238
I've been looking
for it for six months.

218
00:19:20,272 --> 00:19:23,503
I did everything from greasing
palms to putting pressure.

219
00:19:23,576 --> 00:19:26,773
But that IG is a living
example of honesty..

220
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:29,644
..and sc****ing us.

221
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,783
What's he hiding?

222
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:38,650
It's time to call him.

223
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,923
I stopped you from doing so.

224
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:53,369
But... this IG's honesty
cannot be bought...

225
00:19:55,407 --> 00:19:58,399
It can only be shattered.

226
00:19:59,478 --> 00:20:03,608
And only he can do this job.

227
00:20:06,552 --> 00:20:08,315
Sooraj!

228
00:20:11,457 --> 00:20:13,322
Come on. Move.

229
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:43,650
Oh God...

230
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,087
So Surya...

231
00:20:48,894 --> 00:20:50,828
no time to spare
for your father, huh!

232
00:20:52,431 --> 00:20:54,331
But you've been
showing-off at discos.

233
00:20:54,366 --> 00:20:56,800
- Father, I was just..
- I was only joking.

234
00:20:56,869 --> 00:20:58,336
Sit down.

235
00:20:59,705 --> 00:21:01,536
It's been so long
since we last met.

236
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:03,837
And your smile...

237
00:21:04,843 --> 00:21:06,606
I completely forgot how it looked.

238
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,946
See... I still couldn't do it.

239
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:16,288
When he was a kid, I would try
to pull off this trick every day..

240
00:21:16,322 --> 00:21:18,916
But I would fail and
he would laugh at me.

241
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:29,965
Your mother was
like a sister to me.

242
00:21:31,537 --> 00:21:33,061
She pestered me a lot.

243
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:36,304
Each day she would
come up and say..

244
00:21:36,342 --> 00:21:38,708
"We need to help
him today... or him.."

245
00:21:39,578 --> 00:21:42,479
She always cared about
others more than herself.

246
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:46,814
Ibrahim's daughter's
marriage... Dinesh's MBA...

247
00:21:47,886 --> 00:21:49,854
I've the full report.

248
00:21:54,627 --> 00:21:56,527
Father... what's all this?

249
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,354
I know.

250
00:22:00,633 --> 00:22:02,863
I want to get out of here.

251
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,303
Will you do something for me?

252
00:22:15,848 --> 00:22:16,837
Stupid.

253
00:22:24,423 --> 00:22:27,324
Stupid. Can't believe them.

254
00:22:38,003 --> 00:22:38,935
You?

255
00:22:39,438 --> 00:22:40,405
You?

256
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:43,705
I see...

257
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:46,741
So dad sent you for my security.

258
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:47,603
Yes.

259
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,841
Inspector Sooraj Kaushik.
Secretary Division..

260
00:22:49,915 --> 00:22:50,711
Security Division!

261
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:52,478
Crime Branch, Mumbai Police.

262
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:54,477
Your life is in danger.

263
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:56,487
Some people want to kidnap you..

264
00:22:56,555 --> 00:22:58,079
..and blackmail IG sir.

265
00:22:59,024 --> 00:23:01,822
Sir's orders are that
we take you someplace safe.

266
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:03,995
Give me your phone.

267
00:23:04,263 --> 00:23:06,458
He broke my phone last night.

268
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:07,863
Start the car.

269
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:10,731
- I hate you Dhiraj..
- Yeah, Radha.

270
00:23:10,803 --> 00:23:13,033
Dad, these officers are
saying my life's in danger.

271
00:23:13,272 --> 00:23:15,604
Dheeraj, you take this car,
I'll take the other one.

272
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:17,505
Hello, dad, I can't hear you.
Should I go with them?

273
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:20,044
Just do as they say, okay.

274
00:23:23,315 --> 00:23:25,010
- Thanks. Let's go.
- What?

275
00:23:25,718 --> 00:23:27,276
Are you hard of hearing?

276
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:28,752
Let's go.

277
00:23:29,788 --> 00:23:31,756
Ohh... my bag's in the car.

278
00:23:32,524 --> 00:23:34,651
Constable, get the bag.

279
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,571
Fine, we're leaving now.
Call up Radha, okay.

280
00:23:51,643 --> 00:23:52,769
Okay, son.

281
00:24:17,302 --> 00:24:21,295
"This person's phone is switched off.
Please try later."

282
00:24:59,578 --> 00:25:00,602
Mr. Mathur...

283
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:04,581
This is absolute
violation of my client.

284
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:05,844
Hey... Lawyer...

285
00:25:05,918 --> 00:25:06,942
I'll see what you do?

286
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:08,611
Behave yourself.

287
00:25:09,254 --> 00:25:10,846
He's the IG of Police, remember.

288
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,258
It's a big post.

289
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:15,954
- Bloody rascal...
- Dad, please. Dad!

290
00:25:16,495 --> 00:25:19,794
Very good. Bravo, son.

291
00:25:23,402 --> 00:25:25,302
His daughter is missing.

292
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:34,575
I can understand a father's condition.

293
00:25:46,692 --> 00:25:49,320
You're going through a tough phase,
Mr. Mathur.

294
00:25:50,395 --> 00:25:54,832
Who knows where she is...
or with whom?

295
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:56,767
No one knows.

296
00:25:57,769 --> 00:25:59,293
- Mr. Lawyer.
- Hmmm.

297
00:25:59,338 --> 00:26:02,239
- When is the next hearing?
- 18th February.

298
00:26:02,274 --> 00:26:03,798
18th February.

299
00:26:04,843 --> 00:26:05,935
That's too far.

300
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:09,378
I can't help you
from behind the bars.

301
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,244
Pasha...

302
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:18,949
You must have heard that..

303
00:26:19,024 --> 00:26:22,653
..parents can even give-up
their lives for their children.

304
00:26:23,262 --> 00:26:24,593
You did, didn't you?

305
00:26:29,668 --> 00:26:31,431
This father...

306
00:26:33,305 --> 00:26:35,034
will take yours.

307
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:50,784
Now do one thing.

308
00:26:51,857 --> 00:26:53,757
Get a picture taken...
of yourself.

309
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:55,793
Neat and tidy.

310
00:26:57,296 --> 00:26:59,025
For your mourning.

311
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:08,938
Wow!

312
00:27:12,911 --> 00:27:14,936
IG broke the Law...

313
00:27:15,814 --> 00:27:17,509
Now he'll break.

314
00:27:18,817 --> 00:27:20,876
Send the message to Surya.

315
00:27:22,754 --> 00:27:25,450
Keep an eye on the girl.

316
00:27:26,658 --> 00:27:28,649
Keep her cozy.

317
00:27:29,294 --> 00:27:31,888
Get out! I said get out!

318
00:27:31,964 --> 00:27:33,727
How dare you bring me
to this godforsaken ****...

319
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,960
..back of an excuse
of a safe house.

320
00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:38,002
Madam, even we can
abuse in English.

321
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,295
Come on, Mangya.

322
00:27:45,277 --> 00:27:46,471
I cannot believe it.

323
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:48,274
You're assaulting an
on-duty police officer.

324
00:27:48,313 --> 00:27:49,871
- You'll be arrested for this.
- Police officer my foot.

325
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:54,385
I want to call my dad...
give me a goddamn phone!

326
00:27:59,324 --> 00:28:00,313
Are you done?

327
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:03,519
Give me the plate.

328
00:28:04,629 --> 00:28:05,527
Move.

329
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:16,335
Hi.

330
00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:18,901
I've some fruits
and extra blanket.

331
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:20,275
It's quite cold outside.

332
00:28:20,345 --> 00:28:22,973
Cut it out.
Don't pretend to be so good.

333
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:24,442
Where are you keeping me?

334
00:28:24,516 --> 00:28:27,280
Damp... dirty... cold!

335
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:28,785
This is what you will get here.

336
00:28:29,488 --> 00:28:32,252
We're taking care of you because
those are the IG sir's orders.

337
00:28:32,824 --> 00:28:34,553
Blanket... and eat.

338
00:28:34,626 --> 00:28:36,594
I don't want your bloody or...

339
00:28:36,661 --> 00:28:37,787
Or what?

340
00:28:46,004 --> 00:28:47,699
You're hurting me.

341
00:29:16,868 --> 00:29:18,267
You can't call.

342
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:22,262
There's no signal here.

343
00:29:23,275 --> 00:29:25,709
We must stay here
until 18th February.

344
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:36,910
You must be hungry,
please eat it.

345
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:46,822
What's wrong?

346
00:29:50,268 --> 00:29:51,860
At home we all eat together.

347
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:56,373
I'm Not used to eating alone.

348
00:30:12,424 --> 00:30:13,686
Eat.

349
00:30:41,453 --> 00:30:42,681
It's a girl.

350
00:30:54,866 --> 00:30:57,767
Bring my Radha back, Sri.

351
00:30:58,336 --> 00:31:01,567
Do whatever you can,
just do what they're saying.

352
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,972
We cannot lose another child.

353
00:31:05,377 --> 00:31:06,935
I am a police officer.

354
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,444
- And a police officer's children is not..
- Please!

355
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:16,316
Please.

356
00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:48,752
"On the pages of my eyes...
I wrote a hundred times."

357
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:57,421
"The love that I had...
was hard to convey."

358
00:31:59,331 --> 00:32:03,290
"I am your Hero."

359
00:32:03,368 --> 00:32:07,270
"I am your Hero."

360
00:32:07,572 --> 00:32:11,008
"I am your Hero."

361
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,425
Salim, Gangu, where's the girl.

362
00:32:37,502 --> 00:32:38,594
Find her.

363
00:32:52,517 --> 00:32:53,950
What are you all looking at?

364
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:55,008
Did you find her?

365
00:32:58,957 --> 00:33:00,788
- I am the IG's daughter, I can do it.
- What to do?

366
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:01,791
Crazy.

367
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:10,300
She's seen us. Hide... hide...

368
00:33:10,402 --> 00:33:13,428
Stupid. Just wait.

369
00:33:15,974 --> 00:33:17,703
She's coming this way.

370
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,412
What are you all doing here?

371
00:33:29,487 --> 00:33:31,478
We were looking for you.

372
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,419
But what are you doing here,
sister?

373
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:37,851
- Bathing. Any problem?
- You call this bathing!

374
00:33:38,697 --> 00:33:39,959
- French Bath.
- French Bath?

375
00:33:40,031 --> 00:33:41,328
This is how people bathe in France.

376
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:42,400
Ohh...

377
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:43,627
I see..

378
00:33:43,702 --> 00:33:44,532
French bath.

379
00:33:44,602 --> 00:33:47,833
Madam, if you want
to bathe like Indians..

380
00:33:48,306 --> 00:33:50,331
..you will find hot water inside.

381
00:33:52,544 --> 00:33:53,704
Move.

382
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:56,046
Finish bathing.

383
00:33:56,314 --> 00:33:57,713
French Bath!

384
00:34:13,832 --> 00:34:17,393
"O damsel... your eyes..."

385
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:22,763
"I can even die for them."

386
00:34:24,442 --> 00:34:29,641
"You fight with me... and
crazy for me too."

387
00:34:29,714 --> 00:34:34,310
"These tricks... won't
help you in anyway."

388
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:43,021
"O sweetheart... let's hold
hands and let our hearts be one."

389
00:34:43,294 --> 00:34:45,819
"O sweetheart... someone
yank the chain in her brain.."

390
00:34:45,897 --> 00:34:47,922
"and let her fall in love."

391
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:50,995
"She laughs... shows attitude as well."

392
00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:53,799
"Some fix her."

393
00:34:53,872 --> 00:34:58,605
"Someone sprinkle some ice
on her fire and chill her out."

394
00:34:58,977 --> 00:35:01,707
"O sweetheart... someone
yank the chain in her brain.."

395
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,839
"and let her fall in love."

396
00:35:04,282 --> 00:35:06,546
"But not with you."

397
00:35:09,421 --> 00:35:11,753
"You don't get it do you?"

398
00:35:19,764 --> 00:35:21,823
- What?
- Water.

399
00:35:23,034 --> 00:35:24,023
Hot.

400
00:35:24,302 --> 00:35:25,360
Thanks.

401
00:35:40,552 --> 00:35:43,817
"O sweetheart..."

402
00:35:45,523 --> 00:35:49,391
"I can die for them..."

403
00:35:57,869 --> 00:35:58,836
What?

404
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:00,668
Nothing.

405
00:36:01,272 --> 00:36:02,603
Are we short of water?

406
00:36:02,674 --> 00:36:04,335
Would you like us
to bathe together?

407
00:36:04,409 --> 00:36:05,467
No!

408
00:36:23,294 --> 00:36:24,625
Stop, Suraj I can do it too.

409
00:36:24,696 --> 00:36:25,993
- Stop.
- Pakya, give it here.

410
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:28,289
Here.. here.

411
00:36:29,267 --> 00:36:31,861
Suraj, step aside.

412
00:36:34,272 --> 00:36:37,503
- Stop it.
- Snow bath.

413
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:44,313
Gangu.

414
00:36:44,415 --> 00:36:45,677
Salim!

415
00:36:49,454 --> 00:36:51,012
Hi.- Hi.

416
00:36:51,823 --> 00:36:55,281
Where's Gangu and Salim?

417
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,959
Maybe they went to the market?

418
00:36:57,028 --> 00:36:59,394
- Rathodi too?
- Yes.

419
00:37:01,566 --> 00:37:05,662
Does that mean we're all alone?

420
00:37:08,406 --> 00:37:09,566
Yes!

421
00:37:17,749 --> 00:37:19,239
Thanks.

422
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:20,740
Okay.

423
00:37:22,253 --> 00:37:23,584
I mean...

424
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:26,587
You take such good care of me.

425
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:29,016
So thanks.

426
00:37:31,462 --> 00:37:35,296
You must be thinking
"What a mess I am in".

427
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,630
But after...

428
00:37:39,404 --> 00:37:41,304
Oh my God. So hot.

429
00:37:43,308 --> 00:37:45,674
And anyway, I am going to Paris.

430
00:37:47,445 --> 00:37:48,912
Dance scholarship.

431
00:37:49,447 --> 00:37:51,915
Dad won't let you go there with me.

432
00:37:52,317 --> 00:37:54,581
And you must have a girlfriend too.

433
00:37:55,286 --> 00:37:57,311
She won't let you come with me.

434
00:37:57,889 --> 00:38:00,289
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- Really...

435
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,820
I mean... why?

436
00:38:04,896 --> 00:38:06,329
Because I am a police officer.

437
00:38:06,464 --> 00:38:07,954
I hardly get any time for myself.

438
00:38:08,766 --> 00:38:10,256
So how will I find a girlfriend?

439
00:38:11,269 --> 00:38:13,635
But suppose you find
sometime for yourself.

440
00:38:17,342 --> 00:38:19,640
So what kind of girl
will you look for?

441
00:38:22,714 --> 00:38:24,272
I..

442
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:34,688
A bit shorter...

443
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,484
and stout.

444
00:38:38,296 --> 00:38:40,287
And her hair..

445
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:48,364
Should be violet... same color.

446
00:38:49,707 --> 00:38:51,038
- Stupid!
- Listen...

447
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:54,769
Let me know if there's someone.

448
00:39:03,221 --> 00:39:07,817
"I've brought you to my world."

449
00:39:07,892 --> 00:39:10,452
"So what if our paths are separate.."

450
00:39:10,528 --> 00:39:13,793
"but our hearts are now one."

451
00:39:13,865 --> 00:39:18,427
"Your world... is different from mine."

452
00:39:18,503 --> 00:39:23,907
"But we can atleast
hold hands for few moments."

453
00:39:33,718 --> 00:39:38,746
"Someone touch her lips,
and make it sweet like chocolate."

454
00:39:38,956 --> 00:39:43,950
"Someone give her wings
and let her love soar high."

455
00:39:44,395 --> 00:39:46,920
"She laughs... shows attitude too."

456
00:39:46,998 --> 00:39:49,489
"Some fix her."

457
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:54,561
"O sweetheart... let's hold
hands and let our hearts be one."

458
00:39:54,806 --> 00:39:57,639
"O sweetheart... someone
yank the chain in her brain.."

459
00:39:57,709 --> 00:39:59,802
"and let her fall in love."

460
00:40:20,031 --> 00:40:22,329
Are you trying to fly a kite?

461
00:40:22,433 --> 00:40:24,298
No, poor people are
getting humiliated.

462
00:40:24,335 --> 00:40:25,996
They promise us food,
clothing and mobile.

463
00:40:26,304 --> 00:40:28,431
But what about network?

464
00:40:32,677 --> 00:40:34,338
Sir!

465
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:36,068
Sir!

466
00:40:37,348 --> 00:40:38,815
We just received
information from Jammu.

467
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:41,544
He's one of Suraj's accomplices,
his name is Rathodi.

468
00:40:46,057 --> 00:40:47,319
Yes, Dheeraj.

469
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:49,485
Dad, we've found Radha.

470
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,360
Another night,
another bottle, no change.

471
00:40:53,464 --> 00:40:56,331
Let's change then,
let's sleep this side.

472
00:40:56,534 --> 00:40:57,796
Where's my bottle?

473
00:41:02,373 --> 00:41:03,533
Over!

474
00:41:08,012 --> 00:41:09,843
This is over too!

475
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:13,741
Now?

476
00:41:14,552 --> 00:41:15,610
What?

477
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:18,621
Do you know what is today?

478
00:41:18,923 --> 00:41:22,415
Friday?

479
00:41:22,827 --> 00:41:24,852
No stupid.

480
00:41:24,929 --> 00:41:27,659
Do you know what day is it today?

481
00:41:28,032 --> 00:41:32,594
Salim, what day is it today?

482
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:35,764
- It's a dry day.
- No.

483
00:41:37,408 --> 00:41:40,468
Today is Valentine's Day.

484
00:41:41,979 --> 00:41:45,312
- Do you know one does on this day?
- No.

485
00:41:45,616 --> 00:41:49,450
You hold your Valentine's hand.

486
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:54,349
Look into her eyes, and...

487
00:42:00,932 --> 00:42:04,732
Hello... Mr. Valentine!

488
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:44,933
Happy Valentine's Day!

489
00:43:41,465 --> 00:43:42,397
Mangya!

490
00:43:42,466 --> 00:43:44,559
Mangya! Mangya!

491
00:43:45,536 --> 00:43:46,696
Gangu!

492
00:43:47,471 --> 00:43:48,836
Mangya!

493
00:43:51,509 --> 00:43:53,875
It's okay.

494
00:44:11,862 --> 00:44:14,592
Gangu run!

495
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,729
Radha run!

496
00:44:19,303 --> 00:44:20,930
Pasha's men.

497
00:44:21,806 --> 00:44:22,898
Yeah!

498
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:27,675
Shall we?

499
00:44:33,017 --> 00:44:33,949
Where's Radha?

500
00:44:34,285 --> 00:44:35,445
Where's Radha?

501
00:44:46,297 --> 00:44:46,888
No!

502
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:47,988
No!

503
00:44:48,065 --> 00:44:49,999
No one will fire at the bike.

504
00:44:50,434 --> 00:44:51,867
Stop firing!

505
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:53,630
Sooraj's left with Radha.

506
00:44:53,704 --> 00:44:55,865
I repeat, Sooraj's left with Radha!

507
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,032
Stop them.

508
00:44:57,308 --> 00:44:58,468
Block the road.

509
00:44:59,777 --> 00:45:01,642
Move fast. Move fast.

510
00:45:16,827 --> 00:45:18,692
- The chopper hasn't arrived yet.
- Hold on.

511
00:45:18,763 --> 00:45:20,253
Hasn't the chopper
left from Chandigarh yet?

512
00:45:20,297 --> 00:45:21,662
- Sir, I did call them.
- Out!

513
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:44,611
All units move down the river.

514
00:45:44,955 --> 00:45:46,752
I repeat. All units
move down the river.

515
00:45:50,561 --> 00:45:52,290
He can't cross the bridge,
it's broken.

516
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:54,297
All units, stop him at the base.

517
00:46:11,749 --> 00:46:13,273
No firing! No firing.

518
00:46:13,484 --> 00:46:15,782
No one fires,
we need to catch him alive.

519
00:46:16,987 --> 00:46:19,012
All units close-in, but no firing.

520
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:21,281
I repeat, no firing.

521
00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:39,742
Don't let go!

522
00:46:44,315 --> 00:46:45,475
Never!

523
00:46:55,426 --> 00:46:58,953
He's going for the bridge?
All units, move in. Move! Move! Move!

524
00:47:00,297 --> 00:47:01,730
Shoot! Shoot!

525
00:47:20,818 --> 00:47:22,683
Some very disturbing news coming in.

526
00:47:22,753 --> 00:47:25,244
IG Srikant Mathur's kidnapped
daughter Radha Mathur..

527
00:47:25,289 --> 00:47:28,816
..and her kidnapper Sooraj Kaushik's
bodies haven't been found yet.

528
00:47:28,893 --> 00:47:30,827
It's believed that
the police opened fire..

529
00:47:30,895 --> 00:47:33,989
..in order to save Radha Mathur,
and Sooraj was killed in the fire.

530
00:47:34,265 --> 00:47:35,732
Shut up!

531
00:47:36,534 --> 00:47:37,762
No!

532
00:47:39,803 --> 00:47:41,361
No!

533
00:47:46,677 --> 00:47:48,872
You made this personal. IG.

534
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,043
Only four days left.

535
00:47:51,715 --> 00:47:54,013
He'll never make it to the court.

536
00:47:55,619 --> 00:48:01,751
IG's downfall... will
start with his death.

537
00:48:05,563 --> 00:48:06,996
That sister's awake!

538
00:48:09,733 --> 00:48:12,964
That sister's awake!

539
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:26,474
The boy...

540
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:28,578
He's still unconscious.

541
00:48:49,306 --> 00:48:53,402
'Lord Buddha,
I want to take an oath.'

542
00:48:54,511 --> 00:48:57,708
'Make Sooraj better, please.'

543
00:48:58,616 --> 00:49:00,584
'And I will forsake
all my bad habits.'

544
00:49:00,651 --> 00:49:03,882
'I'll stop eating non-veg.
I'll stop being short-tempered.'

545
00:49:03,954 --> 00:49:06,252
'Never ever use bad-words again.'

546
00:49:06,357 --> 00:49:08,222
'I promise.'

547
00:49:08,792 --> 00:49:13,252
'Drinks... Fine, I'll quit that too.'

548
00:49:13,731 --> 00:49:17,223
'And as soon as he gets up,
I'll tell him..'

549
00:49:17,635 --> 00:49:18,795
I love you!

550
00:49:20,571 --> 00:49:23,540
But I could never say
it because of your attitude.

551
00:49:23,607 --> 00:49:25,268
Stupid.

552
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:28,441
But I have decided.

553
00:49:29,246 --> 00:49:31,271
When you're conscious, I...

554
00:49:37,621 --> 00:49:39,248
How long have you been listening?

555
00:49:40,291 --> 00:49:41,781
From "I love you".

556
00:49:47,298 --> 00:49:50,426
- What..?
- Sorry, sorry.

557
00:50:10,387 --> 00:50:15,620
"I can live in your footsteps."

558
00:50:15,693 --> 00:50:20,960
"I can live with your love."

559
00:50:21,031 --> 00:50:25,934
"If you can't be mine.."

560
00:50:26,003 --> 00:50:31,635
"I will live in your heartbeats."

561
00:50:31,709 --> 00:50:36,772
"Why does your heart
keep looking at me?"

562
00:50:36,847 --> 00:50:40,305
"Like it has conquered both worlds."

563
00:50:40,351 --> 00:50:41,943
"Since I found you..."

564
00:50:42,019 --> 00:50:46,979
"I... lost my heart... I lost my heart."

565
00:50:47,057 --> 00:50:50,083
"Since I found you..."

566
00:50:50,327 --> 00:50:53,057
"I lost myself."

567
00:51:27,965 --> 00:51:33,426
"There's love between
us... so why is there a void."

568
00:51:33,504 --> 00:51:38,669
"I can neither touch
you nor turn back."

569
00:51:38,742 --> 00:51:43,805
"I dwell in you... yet I don't exist."

570
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:48,545
"I can't stop... or continue ahead."

571
00:51:49,353 --> 00:51:53,949
"Let's go somewhere far..."

572
00:51:54,024 --> 00:51:59,360
"there's just you and
me in each other's arms."

573
00:51:59,463 --> 00:52:04,628
"I... lost my heart... I lost my heart."

574
00:52:04,701 --> 00:52:06,896
"Since I found you..."

575
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:09,438
"I lost myself."

576
00:52:09,506 --> 00:52:15,274
"I... lost my heart... I lost my heart."

577
00:52:15,312 --> 00:52:17,576
"Since I found you..."

578
00:52:17,648 --> 00:52:20,515
"I lost myself."

579
00:52:20,584 --> 00:52:25,521
"I lost myself."

580
00:53:05,996 --> 00:53:11,298
"When I look into your eyes.."

581
00:53:11,368 --> 00:53:15,964
"I try to hide from my own sights."

582
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:21,771
"There's magic in your love."

583
00:53:21,845 --> 00:53:26,407
"It destroys me makes me whole again."

584
00:53:26,483 --> 00:53:31,580
"I want to walk with
you till the end."

585
00:53:31,655 --> 00:53:34,954
"Because I've conquered both worlds."

586
00:53:35,025 --> 00:53:36,856
"Since I found you..."

587
00:53:36,927 --> 00:53:41,887
"I... lost my heart... I lost my heart."

588
00:53:41,965 --> 00:53:44,900
"Since I found you..."

589
00:53:44,968 --> 00:53:47,630
"I lost myself."

590
00:53:47,905 --> 00:53:52,604
"I... lost my heart... I lost my heart."

591
00:53:52,676 --> 00:53:55,509
"Since I found you..."

592
00:53:55,579 --> 00:53:58,673
"I lost myself."

593
00:54:11,562 --> 00:54:12,893
Listen, as soon as we get to Mumbai..

594
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:14,488
..you must come home with me.

595
00:54:14,565 --> 00:54:16,328
I've to introduce you to dad.

596
00:54:18,569 --> 00:54:20,560
The thing is... I never
hide anything from my dad.

597
00:54:20,637 --> 00:54:23,538
So I'll tell him everything about us,
as soon as we get there.

598
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:25,371
Okay.

599
00:54:25,442 --> 00:54:26,272
Thank you.

600
00:54:27,678 --> 00:54:28,542
Thank you.

601
00:54:28,612 --> 00:54:29,601
Everything will be fine.

602
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,843
And anyway, he wants me
to marry some police officer.

603
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:36,048
So why don't you talk
to your dad right now?

604
00:54:36,853 --> 00:54:38,753
We still have 2 hours
before the flight takes-off.

605
00:54:41,458 --> 00:54:42,584
Oh wow!

606
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:44,286
I thought you'll
be giving your usual..

607
00:54:44,328 --> 00:54:46,558
.. "this is not possible" speech again.

608
00:55:01,011 --> 00:55:02,239
Hello.

609
00:55:02,279 --> 00:55:03,644
Hello, sister-in-law.

610
00:55:03,714 --> 00:55:06,274
- Radha.
- Yes, it's Radha.

611
00:55:06,583 --> 00:55:08,574
Mom. How are you?

612
00:55:08,885 --> 00:55:09,749
Where are you?

613
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:13,586
I am fine, sister-in-law.
But that officer, he's wounded.

614
00:55:13,657 --> 00:55:14,954
Officer?

615
00:55:15,025 --> 00:55:16,686
No one sent any officer?

616
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,523
Sister-in-law, the security team..

617
00:55:18,595 --> 00:55:21,029
..that's been protecting
me for two weeks.

618
00:55:21,264 --> 00:55:22,595
They aren't protecting you.

619
00:55:22,966 --> 00:55:25,264
They are Pasha's men.

620
00:55:26,837 --> 00:55:28,566
They kidnapped you.

621
00:55:30,474 --> 00:55:32,499
Listen... you just do something.

622
00:55:47,691 --> 00:55:52,993
"The dreams that I saw..."

623
00:55:53,063 --> 00:55:58,399
"they trickled down my face.."

624
00:55:58,669 --> 00:56:03,868
"as tears."

625
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:09,606
"As the mirrors shattered, reality
hit me Why don't you tell me now?"

626
00:56:11,481 --> 00:56:15,440
"Am I your hero?"

627
00:56:16,853 --> 00:56:22,292
"Am I your hero?"

628
00:56:22,292 --> 00:56:27,628
"Am I your hero?"

629
00:56:27,698 --> 00:56:31,964
"Am I your hero?"

630
00:56:32,035 --> 00:56:33,468
Trying to run away?

631
00:56:33,537 --> 00:56:34,663
Why did you come back?

632
00:56:36,673 --> 00:56:37,935
Even after you know everything.

633
00:56:38,475 --> 00:56:41,842
What you want is impossible?

634
00:56:41,912 --> 00:56:43,573
Do you love me?

635
00:56:45,749 --> 00:56:47,273
Sooraj, I need an answer.

636
00:56:47,317 --> 00:56:48,841
Do you love me?

637
00:56:51,421 --> 00:56:53,480
I know you love me,
just tell me the truth.

638
00:56:53,557 --> 00:56:54,615
Truth!

639
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,450
You want to know the truth.

640
00:56:59,329 --> 00:57:00,728
You want to hear it from me,
don't you?

641
00:57:01,665 --> 00:57:02,689
Then listen.

642
00:57:02,766 --> 00:57:04,358
I deceived you.

643
00:57:05,736 --> 00:57:08,603
- I am not a police officer!
- I don't care.

644
00:57:08,972 --> 00:57:10,269
Just tell me you love me.

645
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,272
Radha...

646
00:57:12,743 --> 00:57:14,608
How can a goon love the IG's daughter?

647
00:57:14,678 --> 00:57:15,702
Have you lost your mind?

648
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:20,806
Don't you have any brains at all?

649
00:57:21,485 --> 00:57:24,852
When you were born
did your neighbors say..

650
00:57:24,921 --> 00:57:27,389
"Congrats, it's a Goon."

651
00:57:27,591 --> 00:57:29,821
Radha, I kidnapped you.

652
00:57:30,594 --> 00:57:32,255
I am a goon now.

653
00:57:32,362 --> 00:57:33,829
If I get caught, I'll be jailed.

654
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:36,396
Did you calculate how
long you'll be jailed for?

655
00:57:37,934 --> 00:57:40,027
Look... 2 years for kidnapping.

656
00:57:42,572 --> 00:57:43,834
Anything else?

657
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:47,003
No.

658
00:57:47,277 --> 00:57:49,609
Cool... then just press Alt+Ctrl+Delete.

659
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:50,676
What?

660
00:57:50,747 --> 00:57:52,681
Delete your past.

661
00:57:52,749 --> 00:57:53,977
Surrender yourself.

662
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:56,382
- Radha, I..
- Do you love me?

663
00:58:05,362 --> 00:58:06,989
Suryakant Pasha Ranade
has now also been charged with..

664
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:10,393
..kidnapping and murdering
IG Srikant Mathur's daughter..

665
00:58:10,467 --> 00:58:13,402
..Radha Mathur,
who's been missing for few days.

666
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:16,837
Will this be Pasha's
last day in the open air?

667
00:58:28,251 --> 00:58:29,684
- Dheeraj.
- Yeah, Ruchi.

668
00:58:30,987 --> 00:58:31,885
Radha.

669
00:58:32,489 --> 00:58:33,683
Call IG sir.

670
00:58:37,794 --> 00:58:38,692
What happened?

671
00:58:38,762 --> 00:58:41,287
Dad, Ruchi just called. Radha
is alive. She just talked to her.

672
00:58:41,364 --> 00:58:42,353
Yes.

673
01:00:02,012 --> 01:00:02,774
Sooraj!

674
01:00:02,846 --> 01:00:03,778
Sooraj!

675
01:00:07,617 --> 01:00:10,313
Sooraj, let's go.

676
01:00:21,898 --> 01:00:24,458
Come on, Sooraj!

677
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:28,765
Sooraj!

678
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:02,309
Radha.

679
01:02:04,688 --> 01:02:05,916
Radha, look at me.

680
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:09,850
Alt+Ctrl+Delete!

681
01:02:12,863 --> 01:02:14,125
Everything changed, right?

682
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:19,999
Radha... I am only joking.

683
01:02:20,938 --> 01:02:23,065
Just tell them, Sooraj.

684
01:02:23,807 --> 01:02:26,275
Tell them whatever
they want to know.

685
01:02:26,877 --> 01:02:28,970
- It will all be fine.
- No, Radha.

686
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:33,239
I'll keep my promise
that I made to you.

687
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:38,286
But you don't make new relations
by breaking the old ones.

688
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:42,358
What's your relation with Pasha?

689
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,784
Why are you saving him?

690
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:46,322
He's a criminal.

691
01:02:48,031 --> 01:02:49,225
He's my papa!

692
01:02:53,804 --> 01:02:55,066
Sooraj.

693
01:02:55,806 --> 01:02:57,239
He's in police custody.

694
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:00,372
The IG is interrogating
him personally.

695
01:03:02,045 --> 01:03:04,275
I took care of him for 14 years..

696
01:03:06,183 --> 01:03:08,083
..but, it took him only 14 days too..

697
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,685
Bad days will come.

698
01:03:24,735 --> 01:03:28,296
Ms. Public Prosecutor,
please call your first witness.

699
01:03:28,372 --> 01:03:32,240
My Lord, the State calls
Ms. Radha Mathur to the stand.

700
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:50,917
I'll speak only the truth... and
nothing but the truth.

701
01:03:56,266 --> 01:03:58,257
I want to say that...

702
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:02,165
Sooraj is innocent.

703
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:07,871
My Lord,
the witness has turned hostile.

704
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:09,206
- We turn to statement.
- Order! Order!

705
01:04:09,279 --> 01:04:11,144
I was kidnapped.

706
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:12,806
My Lord, witness turning to hostile.

707
01:04:12,883 --> 01:04:14,145
We need a fresh statement.

708
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,676
Sooraj kidnapped me.

709
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:23,919
But he protected me for 14 days.

710
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,228
Sooraj surrendered on my advice!

711
01:04:31,802 --> 01:04:33,167
He wants to reform.

712
01:04:36,673 --> 01:04:38,334
Start a new life.

713
01:04:42,913 --> 01:04:44,642
And maybe... if you can..

714
01:04:45,649 --> 01:04:46,843
Give him one chance.

715
01:05:07,671 --> 01:05:13,701
If you slapped me because I hurt you,
then I am sorry.

716
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:21,009
But if you slapped
me because I Love Sooraj..

717
01:05:21,985 --> 01:05:23,452
..then hit me again.

718
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:30,287
Bela...

719
01:05:32,129 --> 01:05:34,757
your daughter has grown so sensible.

720
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:43,228
Find someone who would be
willing to marry your daughter.

721
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:22,374
Ranvijay Shekhavat.

722
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:24,072
He was my junior in college.

723
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:26,980
He belongs from a
big family in Rajasthan.

724
01:06:27,217 --> 01:06:29,777
These days he's in Paris,
completing his MBA.

725
01:06:29,853 --> 01:06:32,344
Last year he came to India,
for the college reunion.

726
01:06:32,622 --> 01:06:33,919
And met Radha.

727
01:06:34,391 --> 01:06:36,859
And mom, he often asks about Radha.

728
01:06:37,027 --> 01:06:38,392
I think he likes her.

729
01:06:38,628 --> 01:06:40,357
And Radha's going
to Paris for her course.

730
01:06:40,864 --> 01:06:41,796
They both can meet out there.

731
01:06:41,865 --> 01:06:43,958
And if everything goes right..

732
01:06:44,301 --> 01:06:45,290
Ruchi, what do you..

733
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:03,811
Dad, I was telling mom
that this is Ranvijay Shekhavat.

734
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,681
He was my junior in college.

735
01:07:06,423 --> 01:07:08,755
Dad, Radha has to go to Paris.

736
01:07:09,259 --> 01:07:11,193
To forget all this.

737
01:07:11,995 --> 01:07:13,326
To forget him!

738
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,700
Brother, I can't believe
you're doing this.

739
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:24,296
I've been lying since
we were kids to save you.

740
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:25,432
And I did it again today. So what?

741
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:28,007
- Yeah, but..
- Radha, don't worry about Ranvijay.

742
01:07:28,078 --> 01:07:31,206
He's a prince of Rajasthan,
you're never going to find him.

743
01:07:31,281 --> 01:07:32,771
And I've no clue about where he is.

744
01:07:32,849 --> 01:07:34,612
Yeah, I do know he's
not in Paris or India.

745
01:07:34,651 --> 01:07:35,948
So just go to Paris.

746
01:07:36,019 --> 01:07:38,078
- Brother..
- Listen... Listen... Sorry, sorry.

747
01:07:38,154 --> 01:07:39,746
Sit, sit...

748
01:07:45,028 --> 01:07:46,359
Radha, listen to me.

749
01:07:46,763 --> 01:07:48,663
Sooraj's been jailed for two years.

750
01:07:48,732 --> 01:07:51,257
During this time, if some
other boy agrees to marry you..

751
01:07:51,334 --> 01:07:52,767
..then what will you do?

752
01:07:52,969 --> 01:07:53,958
Run away?

753
01:07:54,671 --> 01:07:55,865
Write a suicide note?

754
01:07:57,841 --> 01:08:00,742
Radha, please understand.
We need some time.

755
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:03,769
You know that dad
is stubborn like you.

756
01:08:03,847 --> 01:08:05,075
And these days he isn't
even talking to you..

757
01:08:05,148 --> 01:08:06,672
..let alone understand you.

758
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:10,642
But two years later,
things are going to be different.

759
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:13,685
So if you want this
Love story to work..

760
01:08:13,757 --> 01:08:15,952
..then buy yourself some time.

761
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:18,420
Go to Paris, listen to me.

762
01:08:19,296 --> 01:08:20,786
Just go to Paris.

763
01:08:33,143 --> 01:08:35,634
- Sooraj..
- Rathodi said you came to say bye.

764
01:08:41,351 --> 01:08:44,081
Look, Sooraj,
brother says I should go to Paris.

765
01:08:44,321 --> 01:08:47,654
He thinks if I go away
I will forget all this.

766
01:08:47,724 --> 01:08:49,191
Forget you!

767
01:08:52,762 --> 01:08:56,858
But Sooraj, he doesn't
know that I've promised myself.

768
01:08:56,933 --> 01:08:58,730
The day you're released..

769
01:08:58,802 --> 01:09:01,032
..I'll be waiting outside.

770
01:09:01,104 --> 01:09:03,834
Sooraj, I can never forget you.

771
01:09:04,374 --> 01:09:06,069
Nor can your dad, Radha.

772
01:09:09,846 --> 01:09:14,874
This jail isn't what's
keeping us apart..

773
01:09:17,787 --> 01:09:19,414
..it's the reality of our life.

774
01:09:21,691 --> 01:09:23,659
And the truth is, Radha...

775
01:09:26,029 --> 01:09:27,894
your world is completely different.

776
01:09:29,966 --> 01:09:31,365
How can I be a part of it?

777
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:33,961
Your brother is right.

778
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:37,731
You should listen to
your brother and your family.

779
01:09:39,876 --> 01:09:42,845
And you should listen
to your heart, Sooraj.

780
01:09:45,715 --> 01:09:47,046
Hey Sooraj...

781
01:09:49,986 --> 01:09:52,113
at least give me a smile.

782
01:09:52,655 --> 01:09:55,317
Or the last thing I'll remember
will be your crying face.

783
01:10:30,093 --> 01:10:31,685
I miss you, dad.

784
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:35,160
Keep in touch, dear.

785
01:10:35,632 --> 01:10:36,997
Everything will be fine.

786
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:56,013
"O beloved your memories torment me."

787
01:10:56,786 --> 01:11:00,813
"Brings tears to my eyes."

788
01:11:02,892 --> 01:11:06,157
"I cry alone."

789
01:11:06,229 --> 01:11:12,065
"Sitting under the moon all night."

790
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:19,140
"O beloved your memories torment me."

791
01:11:19,209 --> 01:11:23,168
"Brings tears to my eyes."

792
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:26,945
"I cry alone."

793
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:31,817
"Sitting under the moon all night."

794
01:11:32,255 --> 01:11:38,160
"O beloved your memories torment me."

795
01:11:38,228 --> 01:11:42,255
"Brings tears to my eyes."

796
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:55,976
"Without you, my heart doesn't beat."

797
01:11:56,112 --> 01:12:01,709
"Without you the heart's restless."

798
01:12:02,952 --> 01:12:09,881
"The tears trickle down my chest."

799
01:12:09,959 --> 01:12:15,829
"I swear on you,
the tears don't dry up."

800
01:12:17,467 --> 01:12:20,732
"You know..."

801
01:12:20,904 --> 01:12:23,702
"and so do I."

802
01:12:24,474 --> 01:12:26,806
"What this is..."

803
01:12:26,876 --> 01:12:30,869
"it's the mistake
made by our hearts."

804
01:12:31,247 --> 01:12:34,375
"You know..."

805
01:12:34,884 --> 01:12:38,183
"and so do I."

806
01:12:38,254 --> 01:12:44,090
"What this is...
it's the mistake made by our hearts."

807
01:12:44,994 --> 01:12:47,986
"I am innocent."

808
01:12:48,398 --> 01:12:50,696
"But we're separated now."

809
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:58,900
"I hope this separation
doesn't kill us."

810
01:12:58,975 --> 01:13:04,811
"O beloved your memories torment me."

811
01:13:04,981 --> 01:13:08,314
"Brings tears to my eyes."

812
01:13:09,252 --> 01:13:15,191
"I cry alone."

813
01:13:15,258 --> 01:13:19,695
"Sitting under the moon all night."

814
01:13:49,192 --> 01:13:54,960
"O beloved your memories torment me."

815
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:59,260
"Brings tears to my eyes."

816
01:14:06,009 --> 01:14:11,879
"Without you, my heart doesn't beat."

817
01:14:12,982 --> 01:14:17,851
"Without you the heart's restless."

818
01:14:19,689 --> 01:14:25,958
"The tears trickle down my chest."

819
01:14:26,696 --> 01:14:31,759
"I swear on you,
the tears don't dry up."

820
01:14:35,104 --> 01:14:39,837
"Brings tears to my eyes."

821
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:41,376
Sooraj!

822
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:42,838
Sooraj!

823
01:14:43,012 --> 01:14:45,682
Seeing their good behavior in jail..

824
01:14:45,682 --> 01:14:49,174
..the court pardons
six months punishment of..

825
01:14:49,252 --> 01:14:51,777
..Anand Gangopadhyay,
Salim Amer, Mangesh Puranik..

826
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:55,051
..Balichandra Rathodi
and Sooraj Kaushik..

827
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:57,384
..and releases them on parole.

828
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:32,824
Alt+Ctrl+Delete!

829
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:35,396
Now my new life begins.

830
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:38,133
With you.

831
01:15:45,908 --> 01:15:49,674
The food in Paris
must be so bland, right?

832
01:15:49,746 --> 01:15:52,772
Mom, their food might be bland..

833
01:15:52,849 --> 01:15:55,283
..but other things are quite hot.

834
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:57,007
Meaning?

835
01:15:57,086 --> 01:15:59,077
Don't be too innocent.

836
01:15:59,155 --> 01:16:01,419
I mean... Ranvijay.

837
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:03,423
Isn't he hot?

838
01:16:04,427 --> 01:16:07,692
We know all about your Love story.

839
01:16:07,764 --> 01:16:10,426
By the way,
your dad likes him as well.

840
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:11,758
When is he coming?

841
01:16:11,834 --> 01:16:13,699
He'll be here.

842
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:15,067
Please layout the food.

843
01:16:15,138 --> 01:16:15,968
- Yes.
- Go on.

844
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:18,131
You'll get ice-cream as well.

845
01:16:18,207 --> 01:16:20,698
- Ruchi, let me see the biryani as well.
- You go too.

846
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:27,706
Before you start Losing it,
I must tell you.

847
01:16:27,817 --> 01:16:29,307
I had no other option.

848
01:16:29,852 --> 01:16:31,046
Every day I would
narrate some chapter..

849
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,781
..out of a cheap
romantic novel to dad.

850
01:16:32,855 --> 01:16:36,086
I told him that he
wants to marry you, and..

851
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:38,252
..even you're seriously
considering him.

852
01:16:39,729 --> 01:16:41,162
You're not listening, are you?

853
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:48,200
You're thinking about Sooraj and dad.

854
01:16:50,673 --> 01:16:52,868
You'll do what you've
already decided, right?

855
01:16:55,645 --> 01:16:58,910
Introduce Sooraj to dad.

856
01:17:01,651 --> 01:17:02,345
When?

857
01:17:03,019 --> 01:17:03,986
Now.

858
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:11,286
Hey mister, is someone dead?

859
01:17:14,897 --> 01:17:16,262
I've promised Radha!

860
01:17:28,211 --> 01:17:29,371
Sooraj!

861
01:17:30,246 --> 01:17:31,804
Sooraj, get up!

862
01:17:35,852 --> 01:17:38,980
So this is your Radha.

863
01:17:39,222 --> 01:17:42,658
Sooraj, I know you promised
me that you want to change..

864
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,285
..but he will kill you.

865
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,759
Sooraj, get up.

866
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:46,795
Sooraj, fight back.

867
01:17:46,863 --> 01:17:47,955
What Sooraj?

868
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:49,796
He won't get back!

869
01:17:49,866 --> 01:17:51,663
Let me finish him off first.

870
01:17:51,868 --> 01:17:53,631
Later you can take his body.

871
01:18:55,831 --> 01:18:57,662
I'm telling you, Sooraj.

872
01:18:57,767 --> 01:19:00,167
This is all because I broke my vow.

873
01:19:00,803 --> 01:19:03,636
I swore not to eat non-veg.

874
01:19:03,673 --> 01:19:05,197
But in Paris... I had to eat it.

875
01:19:05,274 --> 01:19:08,937
And since I was missing you,
I also had couple of drinks.

876
01:19:09,378 --> 01:19:11,744
I never stopped using bad words.

877
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:13,343
Everything's going wrong.

878
01:19:13,783 --> 01:19:16,013
Even dad still thinks that..

879
01:19:19,889 --> 01:19:21,117
That I am a goon.

880
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:26,059
It's really difficult, Sooraj.

881
01:19:26,963 --> 01:19:28,089
I promised you.

882
01:19:30,032 --> 01:19:31,260
As soon as I get a job.

883
01:19:31,334 --> 01:19:33,165
What will you do, Sooraj?

884
01:19:33,803 --> 01:19:35,327
There are only two things I can do.

885
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:39,870
Bossing people... and exercising!

886
01:19:42,178 --> 01:19:45,011
My days of bossing people
around are over, thanks to you.

887
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:47,376
But... body building..

888
01:20:07,003 --> 01:20:10,166
"Oh damsel.."

889
01:20:35,765 --> 01:20:38,063
Darling, why you brought me to gym?

890
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,200
You're my Mr. Right.

891
01:20:40,269 --> 01:20:42,931
But I need your body tight.

892
01:20:43,606 --> 01:20:44,868
Let's not fight.

893
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:48,239
Come, beautiful,
let's sweat it out together.

894
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:51,609
I mean... let's sweat it out.

895
01:20:51,714 --> 01:20:53,306
Just... saying.

896
01:20:54,650 --> 01:20:55,742
What happened?

897
01:20:55,818 --> 01:20:56,750
Plan change, baby.

898
01:20:56,819 --> 01:20:58,013
Welcome, BBM sir.

899
01:20:58,087 --> 01:20:59,918
Your friends?

900
01:21:03,159 --> 01:21:05,127
BBM sir, you want to join our gym?

901
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:07,856
No, no, we took a wrong turn.

902
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:09,921
We want to make a body, not break it.

903
01:21:09,999 --> 01:21:12,092
- Let's go..
- Why BBM?

904
01:21:12,168 --> 01:21:15,103
- This place is so cool.
- Yes, yes, place is very cool.

905
01:21:15,171 --> 01:21:17,071
But people are very hot.
Let's go, baby.

906
01:21:17,139 --> 01:21:19,198
Sir... everything has changed.

907
01:21:19,275 --> 01:21:20,867
Don't worry.

908
01:21:20,943 --> 01:21:23,673
You know, Sooraj is the trainer here.

909
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:25,645
Trainer?

910
01:21:25,815 --> 01:21:26,406
Sooraj!

911
01:21:26,682 --> 01:21:28,946
Oh sir, you here?

912
01:21:29,185 --> 01:21:31,745
- Sir, I'm Sooraj Kaushik.
- You're the trainer.

913
01:21:31,821 --> 01:21:34,654
You mean... client servicing.

914
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:36,658
You mean... servant.

915
01:21:36,692 --> 01:21:37,818
Servant.

916
01:21:38,994 --> 01:21:41,224
No tension... only taking your bag.

917
01:21:42,064 --> 01:21:43,224
Just saying.

918
01:21:43,299 --> 01:21:44,766
Don't worry.

919
01:21:44,834 --> 01:21:45,698
This is our gym.

920
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:50,095
- You train here, and we'll make sure you get...
- What?

921
01:21:50,172 --> 01:21:51,298
Muscles.

922
01:21:51,373 --> 01:21:53,307
Muscles, okay.

923
01:22:03,886 --> 01:22:04,910
Hit.

924
01:22:16,999 --> 01:22:18,159
This muscle..

925
01:22:23,973 --> 01:22:25,099
How was it?

926
01:22:25,174 --> 01:22:27,734
You want to go home
and do some more workout?

927
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:35,080
I am so worn-out,
I can hardly move a muscle.

928
01:22:35,351 --> 01:22:36,375
Come on, darling.

929
01:22:36,652 --> 01:22:38,916
You go, I am Loving it here.

930
01:22:38,988 --> 01:22:41,752
Okay, take care of sister.

931
01:22:41,824 --> 01:22:44,691
- Hey..
- My sister.

932
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:46,123
Right.

933
01:22:46,195 --> 01:22:48,823
See you, sister-in-law.
Ambulance!

934
01:22:48,898 --> 01:22:50,832
Ambulance!

935
01:22:50,933 --> 01:22:52,127
Ambulance!

936
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:56,331
- Who was that?
- Satisfied customer.

937
01:22:56,405 --> 01:22:56,962
And she?

938
01:22:57,039 --> 01:22:59,439
That's the customer's luggage.
He left it behind.

939
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:01,676
Free juice... darling.

940
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:08,142
Hello... this is not the time to joke.

941
01:23:08,217 --> 01:23:09,912
Sooraj, brother's coming.

942
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,453
He's out parking the car.
Everything should be perfect.

943
01:23:13,355 --> 01:23:14,720
Perfect.

944
01:23:17,393 --> 01:23:18,223
Sooraj.

945
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:21,022
Come on, get out. Get Lost.

946
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:25,222
What happened? We're just joking.

947
01:23:27,436 --> 01:23:30,667
- Why so serious?
- You don't get it too, do you?

948
01:23:30,773 --> 01:23:32,172
- Forget it.
- Radha.

949
01:23:32,241 --> 01:23:33,333
For the last two years..

950
01:23:33,409 --> 01:23:36,936
For the last two years
she's been waiting for the day..

951
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:42,109
..when she holds your hand
and proudly tell our family and dad..

952
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:44,915
..that this is Sooraj. My Sooraj.

953
01:23:44,987 --> 01:23:46,420
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

954
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:48,748
- Shall we?
- Yes.

955
01:23:49,091 --> 01:23:51,685
Baba ka Akhada. (GYM)

956
01:23:52,228 --> 01:23:54,696
- Your gym is rocking.
- Thank you, sir.

957
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:56,287
No, sir. Call me brother.

958
01:23:56,365 --> 01:23:57,332
Okay, sir. Sorry.

959
01:23:57,399 --> 01:23:58,331
Sir?

960
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:00,061
Sooraj.

961
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:01,960
- Just a minute.
- Please.

962
01:24:03,706 --> 01:24:06,334
I must admit, Radha.
You really proved it.

963
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:09,673
But I must confess one thing.

964
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:13,211
Two years ago,
when I asked you to go to Paris, I..

965
01:24:13,282 --> 01:24:15,113
You thought I will forget him..

966
01:24:15,818 --> 01:24:18,685
..and that will be
the end of my Love-story.

967
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:20,047
No, of course not.

968
01:24:20,122 --> 01:24:23,683
Brother, you're lying?

969
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:27,159
Yes.

970
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:30,362
But there's only one
thing that needs to end.

971
01:24:31,033 --> 01:24:33,228
The Ranvijay Shekhawat.

972
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,190
Ranvijay Shekhawat.

973
01:25:07,336 --> 01:25:10,100
This 10 million is the boss' share.

974
01:25:10,406 --> 01:25:15,070
Will you pay the remaining
100 million here, or at the graveyard?

975
01:25:58,687 --> 01:25:59,176
Take care.

976
01:25:59,254 --> 01:25:59,879
Bye.

977
01:25:59,955 --> 01:26:00,785
Okay, bye.

978
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:05,086
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

979
01:26:05,861 --> 01:26:07,055
Ranvijay.

980
01:26:07,363 --> 01:26:08,921
- Ranvijay Shekhawat.
- Yes.

981
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:10,055
Hi, I am Ruchi.

982
01:26:10,132 --> 01:26:12,259
- Dheeraj's wife.
- Dheeraj Mathur, Velem's Boys.

983
01:26:12,334 --> 01:26:13,892
Batch of 2000. Say hi.

984
01:26:14,303 --> 01:26:16,203
What say hi?
Come on, take my blessings.

985
01:26:16,705 --> 01:26:17,433
What?

986
01:26:17,706 --> 01:26:19,765
I admit you two aren't married yet,
but still I am your sister-in-law.

987
01:26:19,842 --> 01:26:20,934
Come, let's go home.

988
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:21,771
Come...

989
01:26:21,844 --> 01:26:23,141
What... what are you doing?

990
01:26:23,212 --> 01:26:24,076
Get the car.

991
01:26:24,146 --> 01:26:26,341
- You're..
- There's no misunderstanding.

992
01:26:26,415 --> 01:26:28,349
You two are not married yet, but soon.

993
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:29,781
The car's here.

994
01:26:29,852 --> 01:26:32,650
IG sir's going to be
so thrilled to see you. Yeah!

995
01:26:33,122 --> 01:26:34,749
IG sir!

996
01:26:37,059 --> 01:26:38,788
Sit.

997
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:51,001
Ruchi's calling. She can't wait.

998
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:51,831
Hello.

999
01:26:51,907 --> 01:26:54,671
The prince of Rajasthan is here.

1000
01:26:56,145 --> 01:26:58,670
Ruchi, who are you with?

1001
01:26:58,947 --> 01:26:59,914
Ranvijay?

1002
01:27:02,751 --> 01:27:04,946
Ranvijay? Ruchi, where is Ranvijay?

1003
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:07,250
He's with me,
and I am taking him home.

1004
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:08,949
Sister-in-law,
please don't take him home.

1005
01:27:09,024 --> 01:27:11,185
Ruchi, I can see you.
Please stop the car, Ruchi.

1006
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:12,750
Please... stop the car.

1007
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:21,862
Sit... sit... I'll tell you everything.

1008
01:27:21,937 --> 01:27:23,029
- Sit...
- Dheeraj..

1009
01:27:23,105 --> 01:27:24,367
What happened?

1010
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:56,661
Can you please tell me something?

1011
01:27:56,772 --> 01:27:58,239
I think he's gone mad.

1012
01:27:58,307 --> 01:28:01,105
Now you want to make
Ranvijay a part of your lie.

1013
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:21,319
I was pulling his cheeks.

1014
01:28:21,396 --> 01:28:22,954
I was pulling his cheeks?

1015
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:24,658
You're worried about your cheeks..

1016
01:28:24,867 --> 01:28:26,129
..Dad's going to strangle me for sure.

1017
01:28:26,201 --> 01:28:27,668
- How Long?
- Dad..

1018
01:28:27,703 --> 01:28:30,263
My dad taught me.
I used tag along as his caddy.

1019
01:28:30,339 --> 01:28:31,237
He plays golf.

1020
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:34,139
- Dad, I want to talk to you?
- Yes.

1021
01:28:34,209 --> 01:28:35,233
In private.

1022
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:38,939
You talk to dad every day.
Let Ranvijay speak today.

1023
01:28:39,014 --> 01:28:42,711
Aunty, what would you like to know?

1024
01:28:43,252 --> 01:28:46,085
- Dad, Ranvijay...
- Wait.

1025
01:28:47,389 --> 01:28:48,151
Yes.

1026
01:28:48,223 --> 01:28:50,191
Radha, come and sit.

1027
01:28:52,661 --> 01:28:53,787
She's a bit upset.

1028
01:28:53,862 --> 01:28:56,387
She must have made different
plans for introducing you to us.

1029
01:28:56,632 --> 01:28:58,031
She's a bit stubborn.

1030
01:28:58,834 --> 01:28:59,926
Like her dad.

1031
01:29:00,002 --> 01:29:02,334
There's no other flight.

1032
01:29:02,404 --> 01:29:05,237
I think we'll have to cancel.
Call Sheila, she will understand.

1033
01:29:05,307 --> 01:29:11,007
- Sir, please don't..
- Not, sir. Call me dad.

1034
01:29:12,114 --> 01:29:13,308
Dad!

1035
01:29:13,815 --> 01:29:15,840
Bye, mom. Bye, dad.

1036
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:18,880
Sister-in-law.

1037
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:21,121
Ranvijay, thank you.

1038
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:24,818
No thank you, tell me how
did I become a part of this story?

1039
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:28,221
- Actually...
- You became a part of this story..

1040
01:29:28,297 --> 01:29:32,700
..so that my dear brother realizes
that the truth always shows up.

1041
01:29:32,768 --> 01:29:36,260
- And the truth is..
- Sooraj, my boyfriend.

1042
01:29:36,338 --> 01:29:38,772
Aah... let me guess.

1043
01:29:39,074 --> 01:29:42,771
Dad... doesn't like him. Right.

1044
01:29:43,011 --> 01:29:47,004
And you needed some time...
so this lie.

1045
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:51,618
The fiancé,
Ranvijay Shekhawat, someone dad likes.

1046
01:29:51,987 --> 01:29:54,148
You must be getting late,
my car will drop you.

1047
01:29:55,891 --> 01:30:00,225
- No, no, I am sure... my car followed me.
- I see.

1048
01:30:00,295 --> 01:30:03,162
Best of luck with...
What's his name? Sooraj?

1049
01:30:03,799 --> 01:30:05,664
Right. Lucky boy.

1050
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:13,735
Yes, he went inside the house.

1051
01:30:14,209 --> 01:30:16,234
Hold on.

1052
01:30:25,087 --> 01:30:26,349
What are you Looking at?

1053
01:30:27,155 --> 01:30:29,282
Walk faster,
or I'll be out of here.

1054
01:30:29,358 --> 01:30:34,261
And if I get out of here, your
boss will permanently disconnect you.

1055
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:36,924
Understand?

1056
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:42,702
Time is money, you know.

1057
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:47,131
You ran off with our money.

1058
01:30:48,076 --> 01:30:50,306
Now you're here to borrow some time.

1059
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:53,977
You have only five minutes, tell us
how you're going to return our money.

1060
01:30:54,049 --> 01:30:56,142
Tell us how you're
going to return our money.

1061
01:30:57,252 --> 01:30:58,742
Believe me, sir.

1062
01:30:59,621 --> 01:31:03,887
I am the tragic end
in Sooraj and Radha's life.

1063
01:31:04,226 --> 01:31:06,786
I'll create chaos
in their Love-story..

1064
01:31:06,895 --> 01:31:13,630
..that Sooraj will regret
the day he left you and chose Radha.

1065
01:31:14,102 --> 01:31:15,262
Wow!

1066
01:31:16,238 --> 01:31:22,108
And you want me to excuse
your Loan of 125 million rupees.

1067
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:26,670
No, no.

1068
01:31:28,183 --> 01:31:31,880
No, you'll give me
250 million instead.

1069
01:31:32,354 --> 01:31:34,254
That our scores will be settled.

1070
01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:35,918
Wow!

1071
01:31:38,193 --> 01:31:41,060
You really are a rascal.

1072
01:31:42,030 --> 01:31:43,361
Nothing will be fine.

1073
01:31:46,234 --> 01:31:47,929
You shouldn't have lied.

1074
01:31:52,407 --> 01:31:53,840
Look, Radha.

1075
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:57,305
I know it's difficult
to convince IG sir.

1076
01:31:57,913 --> 01:31:59,676
But I tried my best.

1077
01:32:00,082 --> 01:32:04,178
I surrendered. Went to jail.
Found a job. I did everything.

1078
01:32:05,721 --> 01:32:07,313
And what will you say
in excuse of this lie?

1079
01:32:07,389 --> 01:32:09,323
- Sooraj..
- Radha, please!

1080
01:32:13,729 --> 01:32:16,323
How Long will we keep
lying to others and ourselves?

1081
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:19,429
- Sooraj, you know..
- I don't want to hear anything.

1082
01:32:19,701 --> 01:32:21,726
You know I didn't lie to anyone.

1083
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:23,901
Do you have a better idea?

1084
01:32:25,407 --> 01:32:26,465
No, right?

1085
01:32:27,909 --> 01:32:30,742
So then fine, Sooraj. It's over.

1086
01:32:42,023 --> 01:32:43,320
Good she left.

1087
01:32:43,959 --> 01:32:45,187
Good riddance.

1088
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:46,158
What?

1089
01:32:46,828 --> 01:32:47,795
What?

1090
01:32:48,296 --> 01:32:49,194
What? What?

1091
01:32:49,264 --> 01:32:50,959
Stop bothering him.

1092
01:32:51,166 --> 01:32:54,101
This charade should've
ended Long ago, get it?

1093
01:32:54,236 --> 01:32:56,796
And Look Sooraj,
we had decided Long ago..

1094
01:32:56,872 --> 01:32:57,702
Let me speak!

1095
01:32:57,806 --> 01:32:59,831
- Salim, we don't want anyone pointing fingers at us.
- Right.

1096
01:32:59,908 --> 01:33:01,273
And Look Sooraj..

1097
01:33:01,810 --> 01:33:03,141
- Sooraj.
- Shut up!

1098
01:33:04,346 --> 01:33:05,677
All of you.

1099
01:33:05,714 --> 01:33:07,113
You can go if you want?

1100
01:33:07,349 --> 01:33:08,873
Go back to the filth.

1101
01:33:10,452 --> 01:33:14,047
She considers you all a friend,
and you're talking nonsense about her.

1102
01:33:14,456 --> 01:33:16,686
Radha is ready to fight
with the world for us.

1103
01:33:17,325 --> 01:33:19,816
And you want to leave her.

1104
01:33:22,898 --> 01:33:24,456
I am telling him to leave her?

1105
01:33:26,201 --> 01:33:27,691
You left her.

1106
01:33:28,036 --> 01:33:29,196
You let her go.

1107
01:33:31,873 --> 01:33:34,239
She's not a girl,
she's an express.

1108
01:33:34,376 --> 01:33:36,105
She'll disappear over the horizon.

1109
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,405
- Go on. Go.
- Run.

1110
01:33:41,683 --> 01:33:43,844
- Go on. Go.
- Run.

1111
01:33:43,919 --> 01:33:45,648
Run. She must be rehearsing.

1112
01:33:46,154 --> 01:33:48,247
- Did it hurt?
- It did.

1113
01:33:49,257 --> 01:33:50,849
Why you..

1114
01:34:04,039 --> 01:34:06,200
Do you know what's today?

1115
01:34:10,245 --> 01:34:12,679
Madam, do you know what's today?

1116
01:34:15,817 --> 01:34:17,284
It's Valentine's Day.

1117
01:34:18,787 --> 01:34:19,981
Lover's Day.

1118
01:34:21,690 --> 01:34:22,816
Remember.

1119
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:27,128
Do you know what one does today?

1120
01:34:27,963 --> 01:34:36,871
You hold your Valentine's hand,
Look into her eyes, and...

1121
01:34:40,675 --> 01:34:42,165
Happy Valentine's Day.

1122
01:34:43,211 --> 01:34:45,042
It's not Valentine's Day today.

1123
01:34:46,081 --> 01:34:48,777
Fine, then... Happy Dry Day.

1124
01:34:49,751 --> 01:34:51,082
Happy Friday.

1125
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:52,914
Happy Every day.

1126
01:34:55,223 --> 01:34:59,182
Because when you're with me,
it's happy every day.

1127
01:35:01,363 --> 01:35:02,421
Sorry.

1128
01:35:03,398 --> 01:35:07,801
Sometimes I feel like someone
gives me a tight hug and says..

1129
01:35:11,006 --> 01:35:12,439
Everything will be fine.

1130
01:35:13,074 --> 01:35:14,234
Promise?

1131
01:35:15,443 --> 01:35:16,535
I promise.

1132
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:23,779
Amazing, wow!

1133
01:35:24,886 --> 01:35:28,117
You're making promises to my bride.

1134
01:35:28,189 --> 01:35:32,023
I've already committed to marry her.

1135
01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:37,730
In French.

1136
01:35:39,968 --> 01:35:42,960
I mean... if you don't mind, in French.

1137
01:35:43,171 --> 01:35:46,766
And Radha, you forgot everything.

1138
01:35:47,208 --> 01:35:49,676
Those evenings in Paris.

1139
01:35:50,045 --> 01:35:51,842
The stars were in the sky.

1140
01:35:52,013 --> 01:35:53,071
And you...

1141
01:35:54,115 --> 01:35:55,742
were in my arms.

1142
01:35:57,352 --> 01:35:59,286
It was a similar
ambiance like this one.

1143
01:35:59,354 --> 01:36:01,413
The beautiful countryside.

1144
01:36:01,656 --> 01:36:04,682
Candle. Red wine.

1145
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:06,384
And me!

1146
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:11,190
- Ranvijay.
- All said...

1147
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:13,289
all heard.

1148
01:36:14,402 --> 01:36:16,063
Actually, there's been a deceit.

1149
01:36:17,305 --> 01:36:21,105
The only reality was the
moment when you were mine..

1150
01:36:21,977 --> 01:36:23,410
Only mine.

1151
01:36:24,245 --> 01:36:25,712
Ranvijay.

1152
01:36:26,881 --> 01:36:27,973
And end scene.

1153
01:36:28,049 --> 01:36:29,209
How was my performance?

1154
01:36:29,284 --> 01:36:31,013
Thank you for the dance.

1155
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:35,314
- I was just..
- I know... joking.

1156
01:36:36,725 --> 01:36:38,989
- Sooraj, right?
- Radha's reality...

1157
01:36:40,095 --> 01:36:41,653
which can't be revealed.

1158
01:36:42,964 --> 01:36:48,732
- And you're Ranvijay.
- Radha's lie, which cannot be hidden.

1159
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:50,065
Are you done?

1160
01:36:50,271 --> 01:36:51,829
Have you finished
saying what you wanted?

1161
01:36:52,741 --> 01:36:54,106
Did you finish doing?

1162
01:36:54,843 --> 01:36:56,208
Why did you come here?

1163
01:36:57,145 --> 01:36:58,772
I already thanked you.

1164
01:36:59,848 --> 01:37:03,249
And anyway,
I don't need a jerk like you.

1165
01:37:04,152 --> 01:37:06,780
I am going to tell dad everything
tomorrow after my performance.

1166
01:37:07,389 --> 01:37:09,983
I only Love Sooraj, understand.

1167
01:37:11,359 --> 01:37:13,224
And no one can separate us.

1168
01:37:13,795 --> 01:37:16,764
Thanks again you dork-faced Muppet!

1169
01:37:35,050 --> 01:37:38,850
Can't you women ever be punctual? Huh!

1170
01:37:39,954 --> 01:37:41,922
We'll be late for Radha's show.

1171
01:37:43,925 --> 01:37:45,085
Ranvijay.

1172
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:47,628
Dheeraj was saying
you're out of town..

1173
01:37:47,662 --> 01:37:48,060
You should try wearing a sari someday.

1174
01:37:48,129 --> 01:37:50,120
Why don't you trying draping
a sari someday, and you'll know..

1175
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:51,096
Look here.

1176
01:37:51,166 --> 01:37:54,033
See... didn't I tell you.

1177
01:37:54,235 --> 01:37:55,930
Keep giving pleasant
surprises like this.

1178
01:37:56,004 --> 01:38:00,270
I am here to give you all a shock,
not a surprise.

1179
01:38:00,408 --> 01:38:01,340
Ranvijay!

1180
01:38:03,044 --> 01:38:04,636
What do you mean?

1181
01:38:04,679 --> 01:38:07,910
Sooraj and Radha still..

1182
01:38:10,885 --> 01:38:12,216
What's he saying?

1183
01:38:15,323 --> 01:38:16,813
Hello, Radha..

1184
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:41,898
"Without you life is like... a
soulless heart beating in my body."

1185
01:39:42,377 --> 01:39:49,340
"How do we explain
to the world... what Love is?"

1186
01:39:50,051 --> 01:39:57,321
"Let's do something...
in the path of Love.."

1187
01:39:57,659 --> 01:40:04,895
"even if we separate tomorrow,
we die without each other."

1188
01:40:04,966 --> 01:40:12,202
"O Lord... tell me what
lies in our fate."

1189
01:40:12,273 --> 01:40:19,236
"We... we only Loved each other."

1190
01:40:19,881 --> 01:40:27,219
"O Lord... tell me what
lies in our fate."

1191
01:40:27,655 --> 01:40:34,322
"We... we only Loved each other."

1192
01:41:08,162 --> 01:41:14,965
"Today the colors have
been drained from our lives."

1193
01:41:15,670 --> 01:41:22,405
"Two fates are
shattering in our hands."

1194
01:41:23,278 --> 01:41:30,650
"The world won and our Love Lost."

1195
01:41:30,952 --> 01:41:37,755
"I never imagined
we'll ever be separated."

1196
01:41:37,925 --> 01:41:45,696
"O Lord... tell me what
lies in our fate."

1197
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:52,137
"We... we only Loved each other."

1198
01:41:52,840 --> 01:42:00,144
"O Lord... tell me what
lies in our fate."

1199
01:42:00,214 --> 01:42:06,244
"We... we only Loved each other."

1200
01:43:08,683 --> 01:43:10,412
Lovers are never afraid.

1201
01:43:10,818 --> 01:43:11,842
Those who are afraid..

1202
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:13,382
..never fall in Love.

1203
01:43:24,265 --> 01:43:25,323
Dad!

1204
01:43:34,842 --> 01:43:36,742
Why did you have
to humiliate me so much?

1205
01:43:39,847 --> 01:43:42,680
I understood everything out there.

1206
01:43:45,052 --> 01:43:46,883
I won't stop you.

1207
01:43:50,691 --> 01:43:52,022
You go, Radha.

1208
01:43:59,834 --> 01:44:00,892
Just a minute, IG sir.

1209
01:44:14,215 --> 01:44:15,705
Is this what you want?

1210
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:21,179
I am ready to take you along?

1211
01:44:23,925 --> 01:44:25,222
But can you go with me?

1212
01:44:28,196 --> 01:44:29,686
Can you forgive yourself?

1213
01:44:34,101 --> 01:44:35,398
I told you...

1214
01:44:37,305 --> 01:44:38,966
A IG's daughter..

1215
01:44:40,141 --> 01:44:42,006
..can never Love a goon.

1216
01:44:48,316 --> 01:44:51,183
"I can stop breathing.."

1217
01:44:51,252 --> 01:44:53,914
"but.."

1218
01:44:53,988 --> 01:44:55,683
"I cannot..."

1219
01:44:55,790 --> 01:44:56,654
Let me go.

1220
01:44:56,691 --> 01:44:59,251
"part ways with you ever."

1221
01:44:59,327 --> 01:45:03,957
"If the world doesn't understand.."

1222
01:45:04,031 --> 01:45:04,861
Just one more thing, sir.

1223
01:45:04,932 --> 01:45:07,765
"But you made me realize."

1224
01:45:07,835 --> 01:45:09,234
I might go away...

1225
01:45:10,972 --> 01:45:12,769
but I will only Love her.

1226
01:45:17,712 --> 01:45:18,701
Stop me if you can.

1227
01:45:18,779 --> 01:45:23,409
"Yes, I your hero."

1228
01:45:24,118 --> 01:45:29,385
"Yes, I your hero."

1229
01:45:29,457 --> 01:45:34,759
"Yes, I your hero."

1230
01:45:34,929 --> 01:45:41,095
"Yes, I your hero."

1231
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:51,069
I want my honor back.

1232
01:45:51,412 --> 01:45:52,936
"Yes, I your hero."

1233
01:45:53,247 --> 01:45:55,010
I, Srikant Mathur.

1234
01:45:57,118 --> 01:45:58,642
Disgraced Officer.

1235
01:45:58,686 --> 01:46:01,052
- Who gives a damn about it, dad.
- I care a damn!

1236
01:46:01,122 --> 01:46:02,180
I do.

1237
01:46:02,356 --> 01:46:04,916
And you came to advocate
him... that Sooraj.

1238
01:46:05,326 --> 01:46:07,692
To say that he's
completely reformed.

1239
01:46:07,762 --> 01:46:10,890
And that he Loves Radha.

1240
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:12,832
If that's true..

1241
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:14,026
Listen..

1242
01:46:14,168 --> 01:46:17,228
If it's true,
tell him to go to the Police..

1243
01:46:17,305 --> 01:46:19,205
..and tell them
everything about Pasha.

1244
01:46:19,974 --> 01:46:21,236
Tell him to be the state witness.

1245
01:46:25,780 --> 01:46:27,077
Yes.

1246
01:46:27,882 --> 01:46:29,247
State witness?

1247
01:46:29,684 --> 01:46:33,950
Sooraj, Pasha can be jailed
only if you testify against him.

1248
01:46:34,755 --> 01:46:35,847
Sooraj...

1249
01:46:36,924 --> 01:46:40,621
I supported you in every
way to help you reform.

1250
01:46:40,861 --> 01:46:43,659
- And what I am asking of you, is only for my dad..
- Dheeraj.

1251
01:46:44,832 --> 01:46:46,094
IG sir wants to put
a price-tag on my Love..

1252
01:46:46,167 --> 01:46:47,794
..by making me the state witness.

1253
01:46:49,904 --> 01:46:53,237
He wants me to handover
papa in return for Radha.

1254
01:46:54,942 --> 01:46:57,308
This is not Love,
it's a business deal.

1255
01:46:58,779 --> 01:47:02,647
And I am sorry, I won't
make my Love into a business deal.

1256
01:47:21,302 --> 01:47:22,894
Sooraj.

1257
01:47:22,970 --> 01:47:24,301
Radha's truth.

1258
01:47:24,372 --> 01:47:26,067
And I am the lie.

1259
01:47:27,341 --> 01:47:30,640
To keep this lie alive,
truth has to die.

1260
01:47:32,613 --> 01:47:33,807
Keep it.

1261
01:47:33,881 --> 01:47:35,246
Your goodbye gift.

1262
01:47:43,324 --> 01:47:46,657
Pasha sir, your Sooraj was
planning to become the State Witness..

1263
01:47:46,761 --> 01:47:50,720
..against you, for the IG.
I've gift-wrapped him for you.

1264
01:47:50,798 --> 01:47:53,858
Our deal's complete.
Don't forget my money.

1265
01:48:10,251 --> 01:48:12,014
Sooraj Baba...

1266
01:48:13,421 --> 01:48:17,881
I know that Love made useless.

1267
01:48:18,926 --> 01:48:23,090
But it made you a traitor.

1268
01:48:23,698 --> 01:48:25,165
Traitor.

1269
01:48:25,232 --> 01:48:27,962
State witness.

1270
01:48:28,436 --> 01:48:30,597
Against your father.

1271
01:48:34,241 --> 01:48:37,369
Pasha, show me the money.
I've to catch a flight.

1272
01:48:41,982 --> 01:48:43,745
Sooraj.

1273
01:48:45,853 --> 01:48:48,253
Your IG's playing games, isn't he?

1274
01:48:48,322 --> 01:48:49,983
He wants a witness, doesn't he.

1275
01:48:50,057 --> 01:48:52,082
I'll give him a witness.

1276
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:56,921
A witness that will
hate him all her life.

1277
01:48:57,998 --> 01:48:58,965
Sooraj!

1278
01:48:59,033 --> 01:49:00,295
Spit on him.

1279
01:49:01,769 --> 01:49:02,394
Sooraj!

1280
01:49:02,636 --> 01:49:04,661
Where are you going? Come here.

1281
01:49:04,772 --> 01:49:06,672
- Leave me.
- Shut up.

1282
01:49:06,741 --> 01:49:09,972
Of course, Radha,
we will let you go.

1283
01:49:10,244 --> 01:49:12,838
So you can tell your dear father..

1284
01:49:12,913 --> 01:49:16,178
- ..the consequences of betrayal.
- Betrayal?

1285
01:49:16,250 --> 01:49:18,377
Sooraj can never betray you?

1286
01:49:19,253 --> 01:49:21,153
- He can..
- Shut up.

1287
01:49:21,222 --> 01:49:24,658
I saw him making a
deal with your brother.

1288
01:49:24,692 --> 01:49:26,250
He was going to be the
state witness against, Pasha.

1289
01:49:26,327 --> 01:49:27,658
Stop lying.

1290
01:49:27,795 --> 01:49:30,958
- And you believed him?
- Why you..

1291
01:49:36,337 --> 01:49:38,737
Sooraj chose to get beaten up.

1292
01:49:40,775 --> 01:49:42,766
Sooraj chose jail.

1293
01:49:43,310 --> 01:49:45,904
Sooraj chose to leave me.

1294
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:50,879
Because... Sooraj chose only you.

1295
01:49:51,719 --> 01:49:53,846
You stopped considering him a son.

1296
01:49:55,823 --> 01:50:00,886
But he... still considers you his father!

1297
01:50:08,235 --> 01:50:09,395
Father...

1298
01:50:09,870 --> 01:50:10,859
Stop it!

1299
01:50:10,938 --> 01:50:12,906
Family... Bloody drama. Stop it.

1300
01:50:12,973 --> 01:50:14,304
You will drive me crazy.

1301
01:50:19,213 --> 01:50:21,181
My father... my son..

1302
01:50:21,248 --> 01:50:23,113
He left me... he deceived me..

1303
01:50:23,184 --> 01:50:24,776
Open the suitcase.

1304
01:50:24,852 --> 01:50:27,650
Up, up... come on.

1305
01:50:28,422 --> 01:50:29,787
Come on.

1306
01:50:51,145 --> 01:50:52,112
Good!

1307
01:50:55,316 --> 01:50:57,375
You made a big mistake.

1308
01:50:57,618 --> 01:51:00,849
Guess both father and son are foolish.

1309
01:51:03,123 --> 01:51:04,215
Changezi.

1310
01:51:05,659 --> 01:51:07,320
Pasha's men are after Ranvijay.

1311
01:51:07,394 --> 01:51:10,090
And he was last seen
in Suraj Kaushik's gym.

1312
01:51:24,945 --> 01:51:26,640
Sooraj!

1313
01:51:28,148 --> 01:51:32,414
- What did you say?
- Sooraj!

1314
01:51:35,122 --> 01:51:37,022
Sooraj is dead.

1315
01:51:37,091 --> 01:51:38,353
See.

1316
01:51:38,425 --> 01:51:41,952
Oh... he's still breathing.

1317
01:51:43,130 --> 01:51:46,065
So let's complete this task first.

1318
01:51:47,401 --> 01:51:50,336
We'll turn you into corpses first.

1319
01:51:50,404 --> 01:51:53,271
In the name of the Father, the Son...

1320
01:52:27,107 --> 01:52:28,131
Keep it.

1321
01:52:28,409 --> 01:52:29,876
Your return gift!

1322
01:52:43,223 --> 01:52:44,952
Sooraj!

1323
01:54:56,056 --> 01:54:58,786
If I had pressed this
trigger two years ago..

1324
01:54:59,426 --> 01:55:03,260
..then I wouldn't be Looking
at the biggest mistake of my life.

1325
01:55:07,201 --> 01:55:10,432
You can deceive the entire world,
Sooraj, but not me.

1326
01:55:11,038 --> 01:55:12,266
Because you know...

1327
01:55:13,140 --> 01:55:15,700
I know people like you.

1328
01:55:16,176 --> 01:55:18,337
You people never change.

1329
01:55:18,412 --> 01:55:22,041
Your life... your upbringing.

1330
01:55:22,850 --> 01:55:26,251
Blood doesn't run through your veins,
crime does.

1331
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:28,345
- Dad..
- No, Radha.

1332
01:55:30,290 --> 01:55:32,019
Let him speak.

1333
01:55:33,961 --> 01:55:35,656
He's been humiliated.

1334
01:55:36,396 --> 01:55:38,387
People made fun of him.

1335
01:55:39,833 --> 01:55:41,960
But he never said anything.

1336
01:55:43,036 --> 01:55:44,936
What were you saying, IG sir.

1337
01:55:46,673 --> 01:55:50,200
Crime runs through my veins, right.

1338
01:55:50,844 --> 01:55:54,678
I am a goon that
loves an IG's daughter.

1339
01:55:55,315 --> 01:56:00,685
If protecting your love is a crime,
then I am a goon!

1340
01:56:04,158 --> 01:56:05,386
I am a goon!

1341
01:56:07,828 --> 01:56:09,989
I know Radha means the world to you.

1342
01:56:11,365 --> 01:56:15,096
But you're not ready to accept
that Radha can love someone like me.

1343
01:56:18,071 --> 01:56:20,403
And you want to save this man..

1344
01:56:21,675 --> 01:56:23,700
He wants to destroy your world.

1345
01:56:26,980 --> 01:56:30,381
You're proud of yourself,
your uniform..

1346
01:56:31,952 --> 01:56:34,113
..but I want to say something.

1347
01:56:35,889 --> 01:56:37,880
There's not much
difference between us, sir.

1348
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:42,856
You want to protect your love,
and I my love.

1349
01:56:47,401 --> 01:56:51,895
We're not different,
sir, we're just against each other.

1350
01:57:04,751 --> 01:57:06,241
Sooraj...

1351
01:58:11,218 --> 01:58:13,049
So Sooraj...

1352
01:58:14,021 --> 01:58:15,682
aren't you going to laugh today?

1353
01:58:18,292 --> 01:58:20,089
Here's the gift for your marriage.

1354
01:58:20,694 --> 01:58:22,161
I'm giving you my boy.

1355
01:58:22,696 --> 01:58:23,993
He maybe a fake

1356
01:58:24,931 --> 01:58:26,421
..but he's useful.

1357
01:58:29,202 --> 01:58:30,726
Keep it safe.

1358
01:58:32,272 --> 01:58:34,638
- Dad...
- My son.

1359
01:58:56,330 --> 01:58:57,661
Dad...

1360
01:58:58,632 --> 01:59:00,657
please press Alt+Cntrl+Delete.

1361
01:59:01,234 --> 01:59:02,895
What's Alt+Cntrl+Delete?

1362
01:59:03,170 --> 01:59:04,660
You tell him.

1363
01:59:05,839 --> 01:59:07,170
It means...

1364
01:59:08,642 --> 01:59:09,939
let's Restart.

1365
01:59:12,179 --> 01:59:14,010
Let's start a new life, sir.

1366
01:59:15,115 --> 01:59:16,673
No sir...

1367
01:59:17,284 --> 01:59:18,911
Call me Dad.

1368
01:59:48,281 --> 01:59:52,308
"On the pages of my eyes..."

1369
01:59:52,386 --> 01:59:56,254
"I wrote a hundred times."

1370
01:59:56,757 --> 02:00:00,215
"The love that I had..."

1371
02:00:00,894 --> 02:00:04,830
"was hard to convey."

1372
02:00:05,065 --> 02:00:09,195
"I am upset with myself,
why am I speechless?"

1373
02:00:09,269 --> 02:00:13,399
"My silence is my punishment."

1374
02:00:13,673 --> 02:00:17,666
"My heart thinks... but
I still don't know."

1375
02:00:17,778 --> 02:00:22,215
"How do I tell you?"

1376
02:00:23,350 --> 02:00:26,945
"I am your Hero."

1377
02:00:27,687 --> 02:00:30,713
"I am your Hero."

1378
02:00:31,758 --> 02:00:35,353
"I am your Hero."

1379
02:00:35,996 --> 02:00:39,762
"I am your Hero."

1380
02:01:15,068 --> 02:01:22,736
"I walked every step
with you on this journey."

1381
02:01:23,343 --> 02:01:30,875
"Though were held hands,
yet there was a void between us."

1382
02:01:30,951 --> 02:01:39,256
"The feeling of love dwelling inside my heart,
listen to them, without me having to convey."

1383
02:01:39,326 --> 02:01:43,660
"My heart thinks... but
I still don't know."

1384
02:01:43,697 --> 02:01:48,794
"How do I tell you?"

1385
02:01:49,302 --> 02:01:52,703
"I am your Hero."

1386
02:01:53,673 --> 02:01:56,938
"I am your Hero."

1387
02:01:57,711 --> 02:02:01,272
"I am your Hero."

1388
02:02:01,948 --> 02:02:06,009
"I am your Hero."

1389
02:02:28,341 --> 02:02:36,339
"You're the reason... I've
found a desire to live."

1390
02:02:36,683 --> 02:02:43,987
"My efforts are... to find
a place in your heart."

1391
02:02:44,224 --> 02:02:46,283
"I want to be only yours."

1392
02:02:46,359 --> 02:02:52,696
"Can't live without you... that's
all I ever prayed for."

1393
02:02:52,799 --> 02:02:57,168
"My heart thinks... but
I still don't know."

1394
02:02:57,237 --> 02:03:02,004
"How do I tell you?"

1395
02:03:02,709 --> 02:03:06,167
"I am your Hero."

1396
02:03:06,846 --> 02:03:10,179
"I am your Hero."

1397
02:03:11,084 --> 02:03:14,884
"I am your Hero."

1398
02:03:15,221 --> 02:03:18,349
"I am your Hero."

1399
02:03:19,426 --> 02:03:22,987
"I am your Hero."

1400
02:03:23,730 --> 02:03:27,393
"I am your Hero."

1401
02:03:27,734 --> 02:03:31,670
"I am your Hero."

1402
02:03:31,938 --> 02:03:35,669
