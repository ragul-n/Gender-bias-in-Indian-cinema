1
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:24,948
Somebody's burden on
somebody's shoulder..

2
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,958
..somebody's burden.

3
00:02:28,962 --> 00:02:33,956
..somebody's burden
on somebody's shoulder..

4
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:36,959
..somebody's burden.

5
00:02:56,923 --> 00:03:01,917
Why should somebody
enter into the tent?

6
00:03:02,929 --> 00:03:05,921
Somebody shed his blood..

7
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:08,932
..for someone else?

8
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:14,938
Why should somebody
enter into the tent?

9
00:03:15,942 --> 00:03:18,934
Somebody shed his blood..

10
00:03:19,112 --> 00:03:20,943
.. for someone else?

11
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:27,943
Who comes willingly
in this world?

12
00:03:28,955 --> 00:03:32,948
All these fresh
flowers are burning..

13
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:39,898
On somebody's shoulders..

14
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:43,900
..is somebody's burden

15
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,931

Go, go on.

22
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,908
O God!

23
00:05:39,886 --> 00:05:42,878
Divine goddess Jagdamba,
the mother of the universe!

24
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:48,884
Divine goddess Jagdamba,
the mother of the universe!

25
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:43,872
Take, daughterin-law.

26
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:49,878
Divine goddess Jagdamba,
the mother of the universe!

27
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,881
Deva wanted the vehicle
to go in the evening.

28
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:57,886
Tell the workers.

29
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:02,891
Divine goddess Jagdamba,
the mother of the universe!

30
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:32,920
What's the work brother?

31
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:37,926
Umm.. nothing.. stay nicely..

32
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:40,863
.. and don't unnecessarily
threaten anybody.

33
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,867
Stay alert.. go.

34
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,870
Mahadeo.

35
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:01,884
We have to send money
to Balasaheb to Mumbai.

36
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:04,887
Yesterday we got a letter
that his money is over.

37
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,889
Okay.. worker..

38
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:10,893
.. send the money today itself
.. as much as he wants.

39
00:08:12,906 --> 00:08:14,897
But write on the form..
not to waste his time..

40
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:16,905
..he's going to a big college.

41
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:19,902
Study nicely.

42
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,910
Tell him he's become
the father of a child.

43
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:23,912
Do it.

44
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:03,946
What Kushaba..

45
00:09:04,123 --> 00:09:05,954
.. sit, sit.. sit.

46
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:10,953
Arre Mahadeo.. feed that dog.

47
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:13,956
Don't eat everything yourself.

48
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:26,969
Some officers have
come from outside.

49
00:09:28,147 --> 00:09:29,978
Some officers have come.

50
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:37,980
l have come from Mumbai
from the education department.

51
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:41,917
Okay, okay. Please sit.

52
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:45,921
Rane's arrangement is
fine,isn't it?

53
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:47,930
Tell us if there
is any problem.

54
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:52,936
No, it's ok. l'll talk to you
later. Let me see other things.

55
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:57,933
What Sarpanch,
what's the new work with me?

56
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:00,936
A group has come
from Sindhargad..

57
00:10:01,114 --> 00:10:02,945
.. to ask for help
for the Bhirubha temple.

58
00:10:03,116 --> 00:10:04,947
What Kushabha..

59
00:10:05,118 --> 00:10:05,948
..there may be around
25 houses in total..

60
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:06,949
..of public places..

61
00:10:07,954 --> 00:10:09,945
..and you too
require independence?

62
00:10:10,957 --> 00:10:12,948
Arre, isn't Khondoba
in the village?

63
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:16,952
No, but master..

64
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,961
..Bhiruba is the
lord of the temple.

65
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:22,966
Arre, but isn't Bhiruba
another form of Khandoba umm?

66
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,962
Ok, ok. Find the place

67
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,971
And inform the Sarpanch

68
00:10:29,976 --> 00:10:31,967
Ok.Ok.

69
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:34,970
Navle. What sir?

70
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:36,979
Do one thing.

71
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,913
From next month
deduct 50 paise..

72
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:40,916
..from every worker
of the factory.

73
00:10:41,087 --> 00:10:42,918
Ok.

74
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:44,920
you Sarpanch, take
out 1 rupee each..

75
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:47,924
.. from the village.

76
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:53,922
And take Rs.5 from
the sugarcane dealers.

77
00:10:54,934 --> 00:10:55,923
The balance l'll give.

78
00:10:57,937 --> 00:11:00,929
What Kushaba? We're
grateful boss sir.

79
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:02,930
C'mon.

80
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:10,939
What Navle, what's the news
from the factory?

81
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:12,948
The association is
having a complaint sir.

82
00:11:13,953 --> 00:11:14,942
What?

83
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:16,952
The weight of the sugarcane
is not being recorded properly.

84
00:11:17,957 --> 00:11:19,948
l didn't understand.

85
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:21,957
The association says that
the weight of the sugarcane..

86
00:11:22,128 --> 00:11:23,959
..only recorded up to the kilo..

87
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,961
..but not up to the gram.

88
00:11:26,132 --> 00:11:27,963
They wish that this
should be done.

89
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:31,968
Very good! They've
become too smart.

90
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:37,974
Ok.. raise this agenda
in the next meeting.

91
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:40,902
They've grown teeth.. what else?

92
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,914
Arre Navle. Yes sir.
You get to work. Ok sir.

93
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:46,915
l'm leaving. Salutations Sir!

94
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:50,912
Sir, we'll talk inside.

95
00:11:56,929 --> 00:11:58,920
Our durbar is like this, sir.

96
00:11:59,932 --> 00:12:01,923
At one time it's easy
to stay in Mumbai..

97
00:12:02,101 --> 00:12:03,932
..and rule Maharashtra sir.

98
00:12:04,937 --> 00:12:06,928
But it is very difficult
to rule a village.

99
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,931
There're people who ask
a thousand things.

100
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:12,942
Oh! You please be seated.
-Thank you

101
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:19,941
l don't like this..
grand style, sir.

102
00:12:20,953 --> 00:12:22,944
We're illiterate people.

103
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:24,953
But l have to live like
this because people..

104
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:27,957
..like you come
from Pune,Mumbai.

105
00:12:29,962 --> 00:12:32,954
They're used to it.
You have it.. omlette.

106
00:12:33,966 --> 00:12:35,957
No l've finished.
You have it.

107
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:41,897
You know, sir..

108
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:45,909
.. l eat only twice a day.

109
00:12:46,913 --> 00:12:48,904
No breakfast etc. at all.

110
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,907
You take.

111
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:54,918
Where do the poor man
of this country..

112
00:12:55,088 --> 00:12:57,921
..get even one
proper meal a day?

113
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:00,916
You take.

114
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,931
Wow.

115
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:18,942
Ustad Ali Akbar Khan.
Raag Bhairon.

116
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:22,938
He's a great musician,
sir.Great Master!

117
00:13:24,951 --> 00:13:27,943
Aah.. Mahadeo. Serve
more omlette to sir.

118
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:30,954
No, no. What is this? These
are eggs from our farm.. take

119
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:32,955
No, no. Ok!

120
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:37,953
Sir, there is noting less here.

121
00:13:38,064 --> 00:13:39,895
There's a lot.

122
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,892
There's no need
of being stingy but..

123
00:13:45,905 --> 00:13:47,896
.. for this l want your help.

124
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:51,900
The youth of the village
go to Mumbai to study..

125
00:13:52,912 --> 00:13:54,903
.. and get trapped
into it's net.

126
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,907
lf our children are
to be needed here..

127
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:01,918
.. then they should be
educated here itself..

128
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:04,583
..up to degree level.

129
00:14:04,924 --> 00:14:06,915
We understand that.

130
00:14:07,093 --> 00:14:08,924
And keeping in mind that..

131
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:12,921
No you stay. Go around.

132
00:14:13,099 --> 00:14:14,930
..make a survey.

133
00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:18,927
Think.. what?

134
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:22,931
You'll be supported completely.

135
00:14:23,943 --> 00:14:26,935
Give me the report.
You take rest, today.

136
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:28,944
The car will come to
pick you up tomorrow.

137
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:31,940
And sir.

138
00:14:34,954 --> 00:14:36,945
See my kingdom.

139
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:39,891
lt's small.

140
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:41,890
But l've made it.

141
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:44,894
With my sweat and blood.
With my hard work.

142
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:48,890
The people of this place were
quarreling amongst themselves.

143
00:14:49,902 --> 00:14:53,895
Men and dogs used to fight for
a single piece of chapatti.

144
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:56,898
But now they're getting
their fill by working hard.

145
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,902
You see for yourself or
else you'll say that..

146
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,911
.. Hindurao is bragging.

147
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:12,914
Ok.. l'll see you.

148
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:40,875
This guest has
come from somewhere.

149
00:15:41,887 --> 00:15:44,879
He got attracted
to my fair skin.

150
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:47,882
And l made a bunch of my things.

151
00:15:51,897 --> 00:15:53,888
Don't, Gamle.

152
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,891
Let me sleep for some more time.

153
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:01,896
Who knows what happened
to this Maru's job!?

154
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:04,899
We have to search him.

155
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:06,908
And what it is. l don't know

156
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:08,910
l'll tell you what happened.

157
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:10,912
Nandya, take two teas outside.

158
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:13,908
C'mon, give water fast.

159
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:16,919
Maruti Kamble and
that candidate..

160
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:18,920
.. are not to be seen.

161
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:21,916
What do you think?

162
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,922
Something must've happened.

163
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,933
There's a dimple on my cheeks.

164
00:16:31,103 --> 00:16:32,934
Come Sarjerao.
What do you want?

165
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:35,930
Don't come with me

166
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:38,872
This will not do?
You have to take milk.

167
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:40,876
Nandya,bring a glass of milk..

168
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:41,877
..first class.

169
00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:46,883
The mirror feels
shy looking at me.

170
00:16:47,887 --> 00:16:50,879
They say that l am a
myna from Pune.

171
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:53,882
They should be eaten,

172
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:05,894
My face is so
fair and beautiful.

173
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:07,903
Take Sarjerao.

174
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:11,900
My face is so
fair and beautiful.

175
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:13,909
My hair is plaited
like a snake.

176
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,907
My sari slips down
from my head.

177
00:17:19,085 --> 00:17:22,919
My sari slips down
from my head.

178
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:24,920
ls it so?

179
00:17:25,091 --> 00:17:27,924
They say that l am

Thrash him.

Duping money.

203
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:28,979
Hit him.

204
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:30,982
They have the
money to get drunk.

205
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:31,982
Bloody freeloaders!

206
00:19:32,985 --> 00:19:34,976
l left him as he was old.

207
00:19:38,924 --> 00:19:40,915
ln khadi clothes.

208
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:43,918
He doesn't seem
from this village.

209
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:45,930
lt looks like
he's from outside.

210
00:20:29,975 --> 00:20:32,967
C'mon go there.. go.

211
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:51,920
Sir, we got a letter
from the workers.

212
00:20:51,997 --> 00:20:53,931
.. asking for bonus.

213
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:58,927
Find out about the financial
position. Okay.

214
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:00,938
Call a meeting of the
board. Okay, sir.

215
00:21:01,006 --> 00:21:01,938
And send it to them.
Right sir.

216
00:21:02,007 --> 00:21:03,941
And we told that Raut
to make the labels..

217
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:06,944
..of the country liquor.
What happened about it?

218
00:21:07,012 --> 00:21:07,944
He has made them, sir.

219
00:21:08,013 --> 00:21:09,947
They're very beautiful.

220
00:21:13,953 --> 00:21:16,945
Okay Navle! Okay, sir.

221
00:21:22,962 --> 00:21:24,953
What Sarjerao?

222
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,964
A new face has come in the
village this morning.

223
00:21:27,032 --> 00:21:28,966
Who's that?

224
00:21:29,034 --> 00:21:29,966
We can't make out yet..

225
00:21:30,035 --> 00:21:31,969
..he's in khadi clothes.

226
00:21:32,037 --> 00:21:34,972
He's pretending not to have
any money in his pocket

227
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,974
He seems educated.

228
00:21:38,911 --> 00:21:40,902
Any name, village?

229
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,914
We'll come to know.

230
00:21:42,982 --> 00:21:45,917
But his breath can be
smelt from a furlong.

231
00:21:46,986 --> 00:21:47,918
l have a doubt.

232
00:21:47,987 --> 00:21:49,921
Of what?

233
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:51,923
He's not an ordinary man.

234
00:21:51,991 --> 00:21:53,925
He must've been sent.

235
00:21:54,927 --> 00:21:55,916
ls it? - Then?

236
00:21:55,995 --> 00:21:59,931
They come for inspection
in disguise.

237
00:22:00,933 --> 00:22:02,924
That's ok.. be on your guard.

238
00:22:03,002 --> 00:22:05,937
And if he's willing to work..

239
00:22:06,005 --> 00:22:07,939
.. then put him on the farm.

240
00:22:08,007 --> 00:22:08,939
He'll be in our sight.

241
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:10,942
And if he's not
willing to work..

242
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,944
..then hunt him out.

243
00:22:13,012 --> 00:22:14,946
You go now.

244
00:22:31,964 --> 00:22:33,955
Hindurao Dhonde Patil, here.

245
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:34,965
Regards!

246
00:22:35,034 --> 00:22:37,969
How did you think of
calling from Mumbai?

247
00:22:38,904 --> 00:22:41,896
You called this poor man..

248
00:22:41,974 --> 00:22:43,908
.. just like that.

249
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,901
l'm glad.

250
00:22:47,913 --> 00:22:50,905
What can l do for you?

251
00:22:50,983 --> 00:22:53,918
What can l say sir?

252
00:22:53,986 --> 00:22:55,920
l'm an illiterate man.

253
00:22:55,988 --> 00:22:57,922
You people are high class.

254
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,925
High command people
means high class.

255
00:23:00,993 --> 00:23:03,928
You have contacts upto Delhi.

256
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,922
What's the news about
the price of sugar?

257
00:23:08,934 --> 00:23:11,926
Aah.. from Delhi.

258
00:23:12,938 --> 00:23:14,929
Who're we to fix it?

259
00:23:15,007 --> 00:23:16,941
We make sugar.

260
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:18,943
The prices are fixed
in Delhi,isn't it?

261
00:23:21,947 --> 00:23:23,938
Yes, yes.

262
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,942
What is Urle sir saying?

263
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:24,926
Khadi dress and drunk?

264
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:26,934
Useless fellow.

265
00:25:27,005 --> 00:25:29,940
You're a disgrace to mankind.

266
00:25:30,008 --> 00:25:31,942
Why don't you die?

267
00:25:38,884 --> 00:25:41,876
Ok, ok.. means.. means..

268
00:25:41,954 --> 00:25:44,889
.. you're taking
me to the cemetery.

269
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:47,882
Take me.

270
00:25:48,894 --> 00:25:51,886
What about my last wishes?

271
00:25:52,898 --> 00:25:55,890
My will? Death certificate?

272
00:25:58,904 --> 00:26:01,896
lt is my will, that
my heart may be given..

273
00:26:01,974 --> 00:26:03,908
..to the doctors for learning..

274
00:26:03,976 --> 00:26:07,912
..and bones to the
dogs for eating.

275
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,915
That's the only
use l can be of.

276
00:26:22,928 --> 00:26:23,917
Had the men who had gone
for food returned?

277
00:26:23,996 --> 00:26:24,928
They've come, sir.

278
00:26:24,997 --> 00:26:27,932
There's a man in the jeep.
Take him in.

279
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,934
Make arrangements for him
to sleep tonight..

280
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:31,936
..we'll decide about him in
the morning. Yes sir.

281
00:26:32,004 --> 00:26:34,939
Don't allow him to leave in
the night. No sir.

282
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,872
l think we have
reached the cemetery.

283
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,884
The arrangements to go
have also been made.

284
00:26:46,952 --> 00:26:48,886
C'mon, useless fellow.

285
00:26:54,893 --> 00:26:56,884
Thank you for the compliments.

286
00:26:56,962 --> 00:26:58,896
C'mon, c'mon.

287
00:27:09,908 --> 00:27:11,899
They seem to be
of a high breed.

288
00:27:11,977 --> 00:27:13,911
That's why they're aggressive.

289
00:27:14,913 --> 00:27:17,905
Pride of their breed.

290
00:27:17,983 --> 00:27:20,918
Good.. good

291
00:27:20,986 --> 00:27:22,920
C'mon.

292
00:27:41,873 --> 00:27:43,864
May peace be with all of you.

293
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:47,868
You.. called me?

294
00:27:49,881 --> 00:27:51,872
Please have a seat. yes.

295
00:27:53,885 --> 00:27:55,876
Not there

296
00:27:55,954 --> 00:27:57,888
ln front of me. On the chair.

297
00:27:57,956 --> 00:27:59,890
l'm not worthy of it.

298
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:01,892
l'm okay outside
there on the chowk.

299
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,894
Right now sit here.

300
00:28:16,908 --> 00:28:18,899
lt's like a palace.

301
00:28:19,911 --> 00:28:21,902
Of which kingdom?

302
00:28:36,928 --> 00:28:38,919
Have tea.

303
00:28:39,097 --> 00:28:41,930
Are you preparing
tea on your own?

304
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:48,929
Take it.

305
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:08,949
Biscuits also?

306
00:29:10,962 --> 00:29:14,955
Now after this, don't
telll'll get liquor too.

307
00:29:15,033 --> 00:29:16,967
lf l get, then
l'll definitely take.

308
00:29:17,035 --> 00:29:19,970
lf l don't get, then
l'll coerce or steal..

309
00:29:20,138 --> 00:29:21,969
..but l'll definitely take.

310
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,971
Alcohol is my food.

311
00:29:24,142 --> 00:29:26,975
My water, my breath.

312
00:29:27,145 --> 00:29:29,978
From where are you? Me?

313
00:29:30,982 --> 00:29:33,974
How and why did you
come here, in this area?

314
00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:34,984
Wait, wait.

315
00:29:35,053 --> 00:29:37,988
Don't pose a
series of questions.

316
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,921
Ask one question at a time.

317
00:29:41,927 --> 00:29:44,919
But it's not sure that
you'llget an answer.

318
00:29:46,932 --> 00:29:50,925
Don't get angry.. but
first of all , who're you?

319
00:29:52,003 --> 00:29:54,938
Hindurao Dhonde Patil.

320
00:29:55,941 --> 00:29:59,934
everything in this area
is controlled by me.

321
00:30:00,112 --> 00:30:03,946
Good, good, l'm glad.

322
00:30:04,015 --> 00:30:05,949
Through your pride?

323
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:08,943
What did you say?

324
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,954
Not through pride.

325
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:12,956
l'm telling you the
factual situation.

326
00:30:13,024 --> 00:30:14,958
ln other words..

327
00:30:15,026 --> 00:30:17,961
..pride is also a
factual situation.

328
00:30:18,964 --> 00:30:20,955
And until and
unless the factual..

329
00:30:21,032 --> 00:30:21,964
..situation is not known..

330
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:22,965
..every claim makes us proud.

331
00:30:23,969 --> 00:30:26,961
You don't just feel
bad, unnecessarily.

332
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:29,973
But instead of feeling
ashamed of one's life.

333
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:31,975
..it's better to feel proud?

334
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,916
Ok, what progress have
you made in this area?

335
00:30:43,922 --> 00:30:47,915
The condition of this
area was pitiful.

336
00:30:48,927 --> 00:30:50,918
People were fighting for food.

337
00:30:50,996 --> 00:30:52,930
Nobody wanted to work.

338
00:30:53,932 --> 00:30:55,923
They used to borrow
from the landlord..

339
00:30:56,001 --> 00:30:57,935
..and their houses
were usurped.

340
00:30:58,003 --> 00:30:59,937
every year epidemics
used to spread.

341
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:01,939
.. and many people used to die.

342
00:31:03,942 --> 00:31:04,931
Forget dispensaries..

343
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,943
..but there were no
primary school even.

344
00:31:08,013 --> 00:31:09,947
During the 3
months of summer..

345
00:31:10,015 --> 00:31:12,950
..there wasn't a single
drop of water in the ponds.

346
00:31:13,018 --> 00:31:15,953
We had to bring water
from as far as 7 miles.

347
00:31:16,021 --> 00:31:17,955
l thought..

348
00:31:18,023 --> 00:31:18,955
..thought..

349
00:31:19,124 --> 00:31:21,957
..why can't this
situation change?

350
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:24,952
And..

351
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,964
..instead of answering
my questions..

352
00:31:27,032 --> 00:31:29,967
.. you're questioning me.

353
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:34,962
What, what do you
want to say?

354
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,972
What is your name?

355
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:38,908
Say whatever you want?
l'll go with it?

356
00:31:38,977 --> 00:31:40,911
You're using khadi..

357
00:31:41,913 --> 00:31:44,905
.. means you're a
Gandhian,right? Wrong.

358
00:31:50,922 --> 00:31:53,914
There wasn't anything
worth wearing..

359
00:31:53,992 --> 00:31:55,926
.. that's why l wore khadi.

360
00:31:55,994 --> 00:31:58,929
But in reality,
l'm a drunkard.

361
00:31:59,931 --> 00:32:02,923
That's my only introduction.

362
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:04,935
lt seems that you don't
want to disclose..

363
00:32:05,003 --> 00:32:05,935
..you name or village.

364
00:32:06,004 --> 00:32:06,936
Correct.

365
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,931
Because to tell you, l'll
have to recollect.

366
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:13,934
And if l start recollecting..

367
00:32:14,012 --> 00:32:15,946
..then all my anger
will come back.

368
00:32:17,949 --> 00:32:19,940
And l don't want that.

369
00:32:20,018 --> 00:32:22,953
And in future too,
l don't want that.

370
00:32:23,955 --> 00:32:25,946
And what's in a village?

371
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:28,949
Now, our village..

372
00:32:29,027 --> 00:32:30,961
..where am l coming from?

373
00:32:31,963 --> 00:32:33,954
..from the pre independence era..

374
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:37,958
..we've come through.

375
00:32:38,903 --> 00:32:40,894
Where shall we go?

376
00:32:40,972 --> 00:32:42,906
Right into the future.

377
00:32:43,908 --> 00:32:46,900
Which means that from the
time of pre independence.

378
00:32:46,978 --> 00:32:49,913
..to the future,
our journey is on

379
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:53,907
You look smart.

380
00:32:53,985 --> 00:32:55,919
You won't disclose
your identity.

381
00:32:56,087 --> 00:32:57,918
l've decided it.

382
00:32:57,989 --> 00:32:59,923
When l find out,
l'll let you know.

383
00:32:59,991 --> 00:33:02,926
Ok, ok. lt doesn't matter.

384
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:07,921
l'll call you ''master''

385
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:11,925
What? Will do?

386
00:33:12,003 --> 00:33:13,937
Yes.

387
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:15,939
But master of what?

388
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:17,941
Not master of the market.

389
00:33:18,009 --> 00:33:18,941
Not master of carpets.

390
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,941
Not ticket master.

391
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:23,947
And singing master..
not at all.

392
00:33:24,115 --> 00:33:27,949
l'm a master of none

393
00:33:29,954 --> 00:33:31,945
Master of none!

394
00:33:32,957 --> 00:33:34,948
So master.

395
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:36,960
At present you
stay here itself.

396
00:33:37,028 --> 00:33:39,895
As my guest. Here?

397
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:42,890
You mean in this area?

398
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:44,901
ln this area.

399
00:33:45,904 --> 00:33:49,897
We'll find some job
for you in a few days.

400
00:33:54,913 --> 00:33:56,904
Till then stay nicely.

401
00:33:56,981 --> 00:33:58,915
Nicely?

402
00:33:59,918 --> 00:34:01,909
But for that l want liquor.

403
00:34:02,921 --> 00:34:04,912
lf you drink like this
you'll die Master.

404
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:08,925
Yes? Shake hands.

405
00:34:09,928 --> 00:34:11,919
l want that to happen.

406
00:34:12,931 --> 00:34:14,922
And it's not happening yet.

407
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:15,931
Do you want to die?

408
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:19,935
lf forgetting everything is
death only then l do want to die.

409
00:34:20,004 --> 00:34:21,938
You're mad, Master.

410
00:34:22,006 --> 00:34:24,941
Yes, you learned but late.

411
00:34:25,944 --> 00:34:27,935
ln order words..

412
00:34:28,012 --> 00:34:29,946
..early according to me.

413
00:34:30,014 --> 00:34:32,949
lt's good. You go now.

414
00:34:33,017 --> 00:34:34,951
Stay in this area only.

415
00:34:35,954 --> 00:34:39,890
We'll see later, what
we can do Yes.

416
00:34:41,893 --> 00:34:43,884
But what about drinks?

417
00:34:44,896 --> 00:34:47,888
lf there a prohibition on
drinks in this area of yours?

418
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:50,901
Then in its protest, l'll
die on the road again.

419
00:34:51,903 --> 00:34:53,894
You'll get it.

420
00:34:54,906 --> 00:34:56,897
The servants will
arrange for it.

421
00:34:56,975 --> 00:34:58,909
Why're you troubling
the servants?

422
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:02,903
lf l get the money,
l'll arrange for it.

423
00:35:02,981 --> 00:35:03,913
As much as l want?

424
00:35:06,918 --> 00:35:08,909
Master, without working
you're asking for money!?

425
00:35:08,987 --> 00:35:11,922
Who's that person?
That's a beggar.

426
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:14,925
Work first and
then ask for money.

427
00:35:14,993 --> 00:35:16,927
Tell me.

428
00:35:16,995 --> 00:35:18,929
What work will you do?

429
00:35:18,997 --> 00:35:20,931
Daily, l'll sew new
shoes out of my skin..

430
00:35:20,999 --> 00:35:23,934
.. and l'll put
them on your feet

431
00:35:24,002 --> 00:35:25,936
You beat me with them.

432
00:35:26,004 --> 00:35:28,939
And by taking that beating
l'll dance joyously.

433
00:35:30,942 --> 00:35:32,933
And when my skin is over

434
00:35:33,011 --> 00:35:35,946
Still don't worry.
My bones are there.

435
00:35:36,014 --> 00:35:37,948
With them, l'll
prepare drumsticks..

436
00:35:39,951 --> 00:35:42,886
.. on my stomach. Master.

437
00:35:48,893 --> 00:35:52,886
Master, these
crooked city talks..

438
00:35:52,964 --> 00:35:55,899
.. cannot be understood
by us village people.

439
00:35:56,901 --> 00:35:58,892
We're illiterate people.

440
00:36:01,906 --> 00:36:03,897
You go.

441
00:36:03,975 --> 00:36:06,910
All arrangements will
be made for you.

442
00:36:07,912 --> 00:36:10,904
Yes, even drinks. Yes?

443
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:12,905
Arre, what's this, Master.

444
00:36:12,984 --> 00:36:14,918
what's this Master? Mahadeo..

445
00:36:14,986 --> 00:36:19,923
Take this fellow..
What Master, you too? Take him

446
00:36:27,932 --> 00:36:29,923
But where is he from?

447
00:36:30,935 --> 00:36:32,926
We'll find out slowly.

448
00:36:33,004 --> 00:36:34,938
lt's enough that
he's in our sight.

449
00:36:36,941 --> 00:36:38,875
The man is intelligent.

450
00:36:39,944 --> 00:36:42,879
But because of drinks,
he's spoilt.

451
00:36:43,047 --> 00:36:44,878
This can be a trick.

452
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:46,883
He must've been sent
for an investigation.

453
00:36:46,951 --> 00:36:50,887
Let's see about that.
We too aren't fools.

454
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,881
But, you be careful.

455
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:55,892
Only listen to what l say.

456
00:36:56,895 --> 00:36:57,884
What?

457
00:36:57,962 --> 00:36:59,896
No, l'm asking only because..

458
00:36:59,964 --> 00:37:01,898
..you kept him in the area.

459
00:37:01,966 --> 00:37:03,900
Yes, l kept him in the area.

460
00:37:03,968 --> 00:37:05,902
Don't be too smart.

461
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:08,896
Go to work, go.

462
00:37:09,908 --> 00:37:12,900
Yes, and confront
that new inspector.

463
00:37:12,977 --> 00:37:15,912
Last month he had arrested
three of our men.

464
00:37:16,915 --> 00:37:18,906
Ask him whether he
wants to stay here..

465
00:37:18,983 --> 00:37:21,918
..or he needs to be transferred.

466
00:37:25,924 --> 00:37:27,915
Who is it, the secretary?

467
00:37:27,992 --> 00:37:29,926
Yes, yes l'm Deshmukh speaking.

468
00:37:29,994 --> 00:37:31,928
What's the news from Delhi?

469
00:37:31,996 --> 00:37:34,931
Why the request? Order me.

470
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:37,934
Today you're the secretary.
Tomorrow you'll be a minister

471
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:41,862
ls that all? Yes, we'll
have a meeting.

472
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,874
We'll have it at
our bungalow.Sure

473
00:37:45,877 --> 00:37:47,868
Your father's property.

474
00:38:15,907 --> 00:38:20,901
ln the palace.

475
00:38:20,979 --> 00:38:24,915
ln the garden.

476
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:31,913
The colorful time has come.

477
00:38:33,925 --> 00:38:36,917
Dear, don't touch..

478
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:39,920
Dear, don't touch..

479
00:38:40,932 --> 00:38:43,924
..my body.

480
00:38:44,936 --> 00:38:45,925
Dear, don't touch..

481
00:38:46,004 --> 00:38:47,938
..my body

482
00:38:48,006 --> 00:38:49,940
Dear, don't touch..

483
00:38:50,942 --> 00:38:52,933
..my body.

484
00:39:09,961 --> 00:39:13,954
These beautiful cheeks..

485
00:39:14,032 --> 00:39:16,967
..will intoxicate you.

486
00:39:17,969 --> 00:39:24,966
l'm enjoying with you.

487
00:39:40,925 --> 00:39:47,922
Who will take this girl?

488
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:01,936
Dear, don't touch..

489
00:40:06,951 --> 00:40:11,945
..my body

490
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:37,972
l did not break the
flower in the room.

491
00:40:57,935 --> 00:41:03,931
There was a foggy atmosphere.

492
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,945
Around the new flag.

493
00:41:15,953 --> 00:41:20,947
Dear, don't touch..

494
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:25,952
..my body

495
00:42:16,948 --> 00:42:18,939
Get up, Master.

496
00:42:19,016 --> 00:42:20,950
Get up.

497
00:42:21,018 --> 00:42:22,952
Let's go for a walk.

498
00:42:24,956 --> 00:42:26,947
Now.. now at midnight?

499
00:42:27,024 --> 00:42:28,958
lt's not night, it's dawn.

500
00:42:29,026 --> 00:42:30,960
There's a nice breeZe.

501
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:32,962
We'll come back
after a short while.

502
00:42:50,915 --> 00:42:51,904
Ready?

503
00:42:51,983 --> 00:42:53,917
Ah.C'mon.

504
00:42:53,985 --> 00:42:55,919
Yes.

505
00:42:58,923 --> 00:43:01,915
Ah.. l'm coming.

506
00:43:02,927 --> 00:43:04,918
You're going to drink, Master.

507
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:07,921
You're not going to drink today.

508
00:43:07,999 --> 00:43:10,934
Today l'm going to show
you a new kind of drink.

509
00:43:11,002 --> 00:43:12,594
New kind of drink?

510
00:43:13,004 --> 00:43:15,939
The intoxication
which is this drink..

511
00:43:16,007 --> 00:43:17,941
..is better than this dirty
wine that you're drinking.

512
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:18,941
ls it so?

513
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:21,945
Once you drink it then
all other drinks..

514
00:43:22,013 --> 00:43:24,948
..will seem like soft drinks.
ls it?

515
00:43:26,951 --> 00:43:28,942
C'mon. C'mon.

516
00:43:43,901 --> 00:43:46,893
Boss, you're going on foot?

517
00:43:46,971 --> 00:43:48,905
Why, don't l have legs?

518
00:43:48,973 --> 00:43:51,908
No. not
l'm walking many miles.

519
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:55,902
The car is for official work.
We can reach quicker.

520
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,914
And to put an impression
on the people coming..

521
00:43:57,982 --> 00:43:58,914
.. from the city.

522
00:43:58,983 --> 00:44:00,917
Otherwise l always walk.

523
00:44:00,985 --> 00:44:02,919
And Master.

524
00:44:02,987 --> 00:44:05,922
What we can learn by walking.

525
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,924
..that we'll never
learn even if..

526
00:44:07,992 --> 00:44:09,926
.. we're born 10 times.

527
00:44:09,994 --> 00:44:10,926
C'mon.

528
00:44:14,932 --> 00:44:16,923
So Master..

529
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:19,936
All this place
has been ploughed..

530
00:44:20,004 --> 00:44:21,938
..by me once.

531
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,931
So, l could tell you
the number of leaves..

532
00:44:25,009 --> 00:44:26,943
..on this tree even in my sleep.

533
00:44:27,011 --> 00:44:28,945
You're feeling cold,
take this shawl.

534
00:44:29,013 --> 00:44:29,945
And what about you?

535
00:44:30,114 --> 00:44:31,945
l won't feel the cold
from our place.

536
00:44:33,017 --> 00:44:34,951
A person from the city is not
used to it, isn't it? Take it.

537
00:44:35,019 --> 00:44:35,951
No, no.

538
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,951
You really don't want it?

539
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:07,907
l built this temple, Master.

540
00:45:24,935 --> 00:45:26,926
You'll be surprised by
seeing this, Master.

541
00:45:28,939 --> 00:45:30,930
Within these 25 acres of land..

542
00:45:31,008 --> 00:45:32,942
..there was nothing growing..

543
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:35,945
.. except for weeds
and wild plants.

544
00:45:36,013 --> 00:45:37,947
even the children of the jackal..

545
00:45:40,885 --> 00:45:42,876
Once l got wild..

546
00:45:43,888 --> 00:45:46,880
..and l directly
planted grape plants..

547
00:45:46,957 --> 00:45:49,892
..on this 25 acre land.

548
00:45:50,895 --> 00:45:53,887
Now the children's friends..

549
00:45:53,964 --> 00:45:56,899
..come to make a
picnic at the creek.

550
00:45:58,903 --> 00:46:02,896
This means that you did a
great miracle, boss?

551
00:46:03,908 --> 00:46:05,899
First this was a small land.

552
00:46:05,976 --> 00:46:06,908
Then it became this big.

553
00:46:07,078 --> 00:46:08,909
Then it became this big.

554
00:46:08,979 --> 00:46:10,913
Then it became this big.

555
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:13,907
Then a co-operative
bank cameup here.

556
00:46:14,919 --> 00:46:16,910
Then, came up one poultry.

557
00:46:16,987 --> 00:46:18,921
And then, came a factory.

558
00:46:18,989 --> 00:46:21,924
And lastly a co-operative dairy.

559
00:46:21,992 --> 00:46:22,924
And high school.

560
00:46:22,993 --> 00:46:23,925
And library.

561
00:46:23,994 --> 00:46:25,928
And what else.

562
00:46:25,996 --> 00:46:27,930
Good, good.

563
00:46:29,934 --> 00:46:30,923
But boss..

564
00:46:31,001 --> 00:46:32,935
..where have all
the small farmers..

565
00:46:33,003 --> 00:46:35,938
.. gone from this
increasing land?

566
00:46:36,006 --> 00:46:37,940
Have they flown away?

567
00:46:39,944 --> 00:46:41,878
l purchased this land by paying..

568
00:46:41,946 --> 00:46:44,881
..the appropriate price.
ln other words..

569
00:46:44,949 --> 00:46:47,884
..appropriate price means
the price that suits us.

570
00:46:47,952 --> 00:46:49,886
Master.

571
00:46:49,954 --> 00:46:50,886
You got angry?

572
00:46:50,955 --> 00:46:53,890
No. You've made me angry.

573
00:46:53,958 --> 00:46:55,892
l'll take whatever
punishment you give.

574
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,894
What can l do?

575
00:46:57,962 --> 00:47:00,897
lt's an old habit.
l haven't spared myself too

576
00:47:01,899 --> 00:47:04,891
l'll always ask unwanted
questions, unwanted doubts

577
00:47:07,972 --> 00:47:09,906
Doubtful person.

578
00:47:10,908 --> 00:47:13,900
Let it be, Master,

579
00:47:14,912 --> 00:47:16,903
lt never hurts when
one slaps oneself.

580
00:47:16,981 --> 00:47:17,913
C'mon.

581
00:47:29,927 --> 00:47:31,918
Salutations! Salutations!

582
00:47:33,931 --> 00:47:35,922
You seem to be a decent man.

583
00:47:36,934 --> 00:47:41,871
l wish you and
you wish me again.

584
00:47:42,873 --> 00:47:45,865
l don't like this.

585
00:47:46,877 --> 00:47:47,866
Leave it.

586
00:47:48,045 --> 00:47:50,878
l wanted to ask
you something else.

587
00:47:50,948 --> 00:47:52,882
Tell me.

588
00:47:53,884 --> 00:47:55,875
lf you're ready to answer,
only then will l ask you.

589
00:47:55,953 --> 00:47:56,885
Promise me first.

590
00:47:56,954 --> 00:47:58,888
What's it?

591
00:47:58,956 --> 00:48:00,890
l'll reply. Ask.

592
00:48:03,894 --> 00:48:06,886
What's the secret of
your cap less head?

593
00:48:06,964 --> 00:48:07,896
eh madman.

594
00:48:07,965 --> 00:48:11,901
You are trying to go
back on your word.

595
00:48:12,069 --> 00:48:13,900
You have promised me.

596
00:48:13,971 --> 00:48:14,903
Old man,

597
00:48:15,072 --> 00:48:16,903
Go quietly on your way.

598
00:48:17,908 --> 00:48:19,569
Bloody drunkard.

599
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:20,899
You're not worth a slap..

600
00:48:20,978 --> 00:48:22,912
..and how much are you talking.

601
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:23,912
C'mon get going or else.

602
00:48:23,981 --> 00:48:24,913
Don't give.

603
00:48:24,982 --> 00:48:26,916
Don't give me your reply.

604
00:48:26,984 --> 00:48:28,918
l'll find it out secretly.

605
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,911
From that Prakash.

606
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:33,923
And l too will be like you.

607
00:48:33,991 --> 00:48:36,926
Without cap.

608
00:48:41,932 --> 00:48:43,923
Now listen.

609
00:48:44,001 --> 00:48:46,936
Our lndian tradition
is one of the gratest..

610
00:48:47,004 --> 00:48:50,940
.. traditions of the world.

611
00:48:51,008 --> 00:48:53,943
By great, l man really great.

612
00:48:54,011 --> 00:48:57,947
So great that nobody
has understood it.

613
00:48:58,949 --> 00:49:00,940
even if it is misunderstood..

614
00:49:01,018 --> 00:49:02,952
..it is great.

615
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,955
lf you can't understand,
then it's great.

616
00:49:24,975 --> 00:49:25,964
Tell me friends.

617
00:49:26,043 --> 00:49:26,975
Tell me brothers.

618
00:49:27,044 --> 00:49:29,979
Can anybody tell me..

00:49:37,154 --> 00:49:40,920
What's under this crown.

621
00:49:53,937 --> 00:49:55,928
Boy, where are you?

622
00:49:56,106 --> 00:49:57,937

623
00:49:58,108 --> 00:49:59,939
Sleeping under the cloth.

624
00:50:00,944 --> 00:50:02,935
Boy, can you see?

625
00:50:03,113 --> 00:50:04,944
Yes, l can see.

.. what's under this cap.

630
00:50:18,128 --> 00:50:21,962
What's under this crown.

631
00:50:22,966 --> 00:50:25,958
Pandoba, Kakoba, Dhadpya
Keshya and Hausyabai..

632
00:50:26,136 --> 00:50:27,967
.. you too tell.

633
00:50:28,305 --> 00:50:30,967
A small bird when he grows up..

634
00:50:31,141 --> 00:50:32,972
.. walks with pride.

635
00:50:34,978 --> 00:50:37,970
A small bird when he grows up..

636
00:50:38,082 --> 00:50:39,913
..walks with pride.

637
00:50:40,918 --> 00:50:42,909
His neck is good, his body is
good with beautiful feathers..

00:50:43,087 --> 00:50:44,918
.. his complexion is good.

639
00:50:45,089 --> 00:50:49,924
He crows beautifully
in the morning..

640
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:54,921
Tell me Pandoba,

641
00:50:55,099 --> 00:50:56,930
What Ramrao, tell me.

642
00:50:57,101 --> 00:50:59,934
A parrot? A myna? A pigeon?

643
00:51:00,104 --> 00:51:01,935
No children.

644
00:51:02,005 --> 00:51:03,939
Boy, do you know?

645
00:51:04,108 --> 00:51:04,938
l know.

646
00:51:05,109 --> 00:51:06,940
Tell me. A chicken!

647

Now who's next?

651
00:51:20,124 --> 00:51:22,957
Boy. Listen carefully.

652
00:51:23,127 --> 00:51:23,957
l'm listening.

653
00:51:24,962 --> 00:51:26,953
The child says l want it.

654
00:51:27,131 --> 00:51:28,962
Grandpa says l want.

655
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:30,964
And mother says.

656
00:51:31,135 --> 00:51:35,970
Brother's marriage is
on the coming Monday.

657
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:40,907
lt's good to keep it for the
guests from now itself.

658
00:51:41,912 --> 00:51:44,904
Tell me people.
Tell me who it is.

659
00:51:45,082 --> 00:51:48,916
Father.

660
00:51:51,922 --> 00:51:55,915
Like the shinning star.

661
00:51:56,093 --> 00:52:00,928
Like the pleasant
jasmine flowers.

662
00:52:01,932 --> 00:52:05,925
Like the shinning moon.

663
00:52:06,937 --> 00:52:09,929
Like the pleasant
jasmine flowers.

664
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:20,942
Like the pleasant soul.

665
00:52:22,953 --> 00:52:24,944
Father? Can l take it?

666
00:52:25,122 --> 00:52:26,953
Oh no.. no..

667
00:52:27,124 --> 00:52:28,955
How much sweet will you eat?

668
00:52:29,126 --> 00:52:30,957
Father, you got fooled.

669
00:52:31,128 --> 00:52:33,961
Sugar, sugar, sugar!

670
00:52:47,911 --> 00:52:51,904
Can anybody tell me quickly..

671
00:52:52,082 --> 00:52:53,913
.. what's under this cap.

00:52:54,918 --> 00:52:56,909
What's under this crown.

673
00:52:59,923 --> 00:53:00,912
Boy. Final!

674
00:53:04,928 --> 00:53:06,919
Hen, eggs, sugarcane, sugar

675
00:53:07,097 --> 00:53:08,928
l didn't like anything.

676
00:53:09,099 --> 00:53:10,930
But tell me now, son.

677
00:53:11,935 --> 00:53:14,927
We're very happy because of
the fun which is under the cap.

678
00:53:15,939 --> 00:53:17,930
The quality of this is
that the moment it is..

679
00:53:18,108 --> 00:53:19,939
..touched, and the
throat becomes sweet.

680
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:20,940
And we forget our sadness.

681
00:53:32,956 --> 00:53:36,949
Because of all our
sorrows and our problems..

682
00:53:37,961 --> 00:53:41,897
..and because of our pains.

683
00:53:44,902 --> 00:53:45,891
Tell, tell!

684
00:53:46,904 --> 00:53:49,896
Politics? Money? Prestige?
No. NO.

685
00:53:50,073 --> 00:53:51,904
Boy, you tell.

686
00:53:52,075 --> 00:53:53,906
Country liquor, elchi, double
horse, rocket, mosambi.

687
00:53:55,913 --> 00:53:56,902
Mosambi,narangi, gulab, elchi.

688
00:54:09,927 --> 00:54:12,919
Please help this poor beggar.

689
00:54:12,996 --> 00:54:15,931
l'm blind, please help me.

690
00:54:16,934 --> 00:54:18,925
l'm sick.

691
00:54:19,002 --> 00:54:19,934
Very sick.

692
00:54:20,003 --> 00:54:21,937
Master.

693
00:54:22,005 --> 00:54:24,940
Your poultry will increase
with 1000 chickens.

694
00:54:25,943 --> 00:54:27,934
And you'll be the chairman
of two more factories.

695
00:54:28,946 --> 00:54:30,937
The government will give
you a lot of loan.

696
00:54:31,014 --> 00:54:32,948
Your rule will increase.

697
00:54:37,955 --> 00:54:39,889
Take. And go there.

698
00:54:39,957 --> 00:54:41,891
And stay nicely.

699
00:54:41,959 --> 00:54:43,893
Unnecessary creating a
scene among people.

700
00:54:56,907 --> 00:54:58,898
Call the servant.

701
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:01,901
Mahadeo.

702
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:03,910
Yes sir.

703
00:55:05,916 --> 00:55:08,908
Tell master l'm
calling him. -Why?

704
00:55:08,986 --> 00:55:10,920
You keep out of this.

705
00:55:11,922 --> 00:55:13,913
Are you going or not?

706
00:55:15,926 --> 00:55:17,917
Bring another plate.

707
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,891
What's this?

708
00:55:58,969 --> 00:56:00,903
You called me.

709
00:56:02,973 --> 00:56:04,907
Remove that clown
cap from your head.

710
00:56:05,909 --> 00:56:07,900
That's my crown.

711
00:56:09,913 --> 00:56:12,905
Master, when are you going
to behave yourself?

712
00:56:13,917 --> 00:56:15,908
Remove it from your head.

713
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,911
lf you slap me once
more, l'll remove it.

714
00:56:19,923 --> 00:56:21,914
ln the morning you
slapped on this cheek..

715
00:56:21,992 --> 00:56:22,924
.. now slap me on this cheek.

716
00:56:22,993 --> 00:56:24,927
Then it'll be even.

717
00:56:30,934 --> 00:56:33,926
Master, in the morning
it was your fault.

718
00:56:34,004 --> 00:56:34,936
Yes.

719
00:56:35,939 --> 00:56:37,930
You created a nuisance.

720
00:56:40,944 --> 00:56:42,878
Tell me, is it not?

721
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,871
Sir, l am.

722
00:56:46,883 --> 00:56:49,875
Am l not under your support?

723
00:56:50,887 --> 00:56:54,880
No - No?

You sit for dinner.

727
00:57:11,908 --> 00:57:14,900
Master, it not good

729
00:57:28,925 --> 00:57:30,916
You destroyed my crown.

You might do anything with me..

..but you can't make me eat.

735
00:57:42,873 --> 00:57:44,864
l'm not going to give
up my fasting rights..

736
00:57:44,941 --> 00:57:46,875
..even at the cost of my life.

737
00:57:46,943 --> 00:57:48,877
l'll not eat.

738
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,871
Boss, you eat.

739
00:57:53,884 --> 00:57:56,876
l'm looking at you.

740
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:03,883
Ok, if you don't eat,
l too won't eat.

741
00:58:05,896 --> 00:58:08,888
No, no, this.. this
is not good, boss

742
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:10,899

.. you slap me if you want.

744

But don't show me love.

745
00:58:14,971 --> 00:58:15,903
Don't love me.

746
00:58:15,972 --> 00:58:17,906
l haven't given you that right.

747
00:58:19,976 --> 00:58:21,910
Boss, you eat.

748
00:58:23,914 --> 00:58:25,905
l'm begging at your feet if you
want, but you please eat.

749
00:58:25,982 --> 00:58:26,914
Master.

750
00:58:26,983 --> 00:58:27,915
Mahadeo, Mahadeo.

751
00:58:27,984 --> 00:58:29,918
Boss, boss, you don't
show me love.

752
00:58:29,986 --> 00:58:30,918
You, get up.

753

Take him.

754
00:58:31,988 --> 00:58:33,922
Until you eat, boss.

755
00:59:01,952 --> 00:59:03,943
How's the percentage of eggs?

756
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:04,952
lt's good, sir.

757
00:59:05,021 --> 00:59:06,955
80 to 85%.

758
00:59:08,959 --> 00:59:12,952
How are the new birds?-They're
good. Death rate is less.

759
00:59:13,029 --> 00:59:14,963
Percentage of eggs is more.

760
00:59:15,031 --> 00:59:16,965
And wastage is also less.

761
00:59:20,971 --> 00:59:22,962
Take good care of the birds.

762
00:59:23,974 --> 00:59:25,965
Keep an eye on everything.

763
00:59:26,042 --> 00:59:27,976
ls it our Master?

764
00:59:28,044 --> 00:59:29,978
How're you, Master?
Are you fine?

765
00:59:31,982 --> 00:59:33,973
Have you adjusted
yourself? Yes.

766
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:36,985
Did you get all that you
needed? Yes, by your grace?

767
00:59:37,053 --> 00:59:39,920
What is my grace?
lt's His grace.

768
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:41,924
lf you need something
then let us know.

769
00:59:41,992 --> 00:59:43,926
Ok!

770
00:59:43,994 --> 00:59:45,928
C'mon.

771
00:59:53,103 --> 00:59:55,936
What happened about
that work, Maruti?

772
00:59:56,006 --> 00:59:58,941
l don't know what happened.

773
00:59:59,009 --> 01:00:00,943
But how good are they?

774
01:00:02,946 --> 01:00:04,937
Look, about Maruti Kamble.

775
01:00:05,015 --> 01:00:06,949
Try to create a fight.

776
01:00:18,962 --> 01:00:21,954
Maruti Kamble..

777
01:00:24,968 --> 01:00:27,960
..who's this Maruti Kamble?

778
01:00:28,038 --> 01:00:29,972
Where did l hear this name?

779
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:32,973
What? Did l hear
in Chander village?

780
01:00:34,978 --> 01:00:37,970
l don't remember anything.

781
01:00:38,915 --> 01:00:41,907
But l've surely heard.

782
01:00:42,919 --> 01:00:44,910
Maruti Kamble.

783
01:00:52,929 --> 01:00:55,921
So Master, are you ok?

784
01:00:55,999 --> 01:00:57,933
By your gratitude.

785
01:00:59,936 --> 01:01:02,928
Yes, who's this Maruti Kamble?

786
01:01:04,941 --> 01:01:07,933
No, l think l heard this name.

787
01:01:08,011 --> 01:01:09,945
But when? How?

788
01:01:10,013 --> 01:01:11,947
That l can't remember.

789
01:01:36,973 --> 01:01:38,907
Arre?

790
01:01:41,911 --> 01:01:43,902
No. No.

791
01:01:44,914 --> 01:01:46,905
This is not my place.

792
01:01:56,926 --> 01:01:58,917
Come inside.

793
01:01:58,995 --> 01:02:00,929
l'll give you water
to wash your feet.

794
01:02:01,097 --> 01:02:03,930
Yes, but l'm not that person.

795
01:02:05,769 --> 01:02:06,929
l think l forgot the house.

796
01:02:07,937 --> 01:02:10,929
What's this lord?
This is our house only.

797
01:02:11,941 --> 01:02:14,933
lt's not possible,
lt's not possible.

798
01:02:15,011 --> 01:02:16,945
l've cleaned the house.

799
01:02:17,947 --> 01:02:19,938
By whose orders?

800
01:02:21,117 --> 01:02:23,950
l've been sent to work.
By whom?

801
01:02:25,455 --> 01:02:27,946
l don't remember anything.

802
01:02:28,024 --> 01:02:29,958
They have sent me
from the bungalow.

803
01:02:30,026 --> 01:02:31,960
From the bungalow?

804
01:02:32,962 --> 01:02:34,953
Whose bungalow,
moon's bungalow?

805
01:02:35,965 --> 01:02:38,900
From Dhonde Patil's bungalow.

806
01:02:40,904 --> 01:02:42,895
l'm working there itself.

807
01:02:43,907 --> 01:02:46,899
Oh, go on.

808
01:02:47,911 --> 01:02:50,903
Now l'm working.

809
01:02:51,981 --> 01:02:53,915
How can he decide for me?

810
01:02:53,983 --> 01:02:55,917
l don't know
anything about that.

811
01:02:55,985 --> 01:02:58,920
l was given orders, l came.

812
01:02:59,923 --> 01:03:02,915
The Patil said you're alone.

813
01:03:02,992 --> 01:03:04,926
And also depressed.

814
01:03:04,994 --> 01:03:07,929
There's no one to
take care of him.

815
01:03:07,997 --> 01:03:09,931
You go in the evenings.

816
01:03:11,935 --> 01:03:14,927
Seth Hindurao is trying
to impress upon me..

817
01:03:15,004 --> 01:03:16,938
.. of his favors.

818
01:03:17,006 --> 01:03:18,940
He's teasing me.

819
01:03:19,943 --> 01:03:22,935
He's trying to interfere
into my private life.

820
01:03:23,012 --> 01:03:24,946
And that too according
to his wish.

821
01:03:25,949 --> 01:03:27,940
You go back like this only.

822
01:03:28,952 --> 01:03:31,944
And don't come into my..

823
01:03:32,021 --> 01:03:33,955
..house again.

824
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,894
l'll go if you say so.

825
01:04:44,894 --> 01:04:46,885
You stay.

826
01:04:46,963 --> 01:04:48,897
You stay here itself.

827
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:55,887
l couldn't make out how much
l slept.

828
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:02,894
And that lovemaking remained.

829
01:06:09,912 --> 01:06:12,904
And who is this Maruti Kamble?

830
01:06:13,916 --> 01:06:16,908
l have to find out. This is
only troubling me.

831
01:06:18,921 --> 01:06:20,912
Like a sore.

832
01:06:34,937 --> 01:06:35,926
Two doubts.

833
01:06:36,005 --> 01:06:38,872
One, how to stay awake to make
love?

834
01:06:39,942 --> 01:06:41,876
Two, who is Maruti Kamble?

835
01:06:41,944 --> 01:06:42,876
Thanks.

836
01:06:42,945 --> 01:06:44,879
Your lowly servant, Master.

837
01:06:59,896 --> 01:07:06,893
O, companion, l'm a
wounded deer.

838
01:07:07,904 --> 01:07:12,898
O, companion, l'm a
wounded deer.

839
01:08:08,898 --> 01:08:09,887
Hey Sarjerao.

840
01:08:09,966 --> 01:08:11,900
Why're you
troubling the dog?

841
01:08:11,968 --> 01:08:14,903
lf there's no work then go
away from here. Go.

842
01:08:56,946 --> 01:08:58,937
l got your letter.

843
01:08:59,949 --> 01:09:01,940
Yes.

844
01:09:02,018 --> 01:09:03,952
l came as soon as
you called me.

845
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:06,955
You must've come to know why
l called you at the bungalow

846
01:09:07,023 --> 01:09:07,955
Yes.

847
01:09:08,024 --> 01:09:09,958
As the questions
were confidential.

848
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:11,949
You look smart.

849
01:09:12,028 --> 01:09:13,962
Less than you.

850
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:17,966
My smartness is open.

851
01:09:18,034 --> 01:09:20,969
Mine is stationary.

852
01:09:21,037 --> 01:09:24,973
But nowadays your nose is
burning too much.

853
01:09:25,041 --> 01:09:26,975
Nose? Mine?

854
01:09:27,977 --> 01:09:29,968
lt's a support for the glasses.

855
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:32,971
That support has grown a
bit long.

856
01:09:33,049 --> 01:09:35,984
Yes, in my childhood, my
parents used to say that.

857
01:09:36,052 --> 01:09:37,986
They used to say,

858
01:09:41,591 --> 01:09:43,923
They got fooled, poor things.

859
01:09:43,993 --> 01:09:45,927
What will you take?

860
01:09:45,995 --> 01:09:48,930
Regarding what? -
lt's a custom.

861
01:09:49,932 --> 01:09:51,923
lt's the custom of our house.

862
01:09:52,935 --> 01:09:55,927
When a guest
comes to the house..

863
01:09:56,005 --> 01:09:58,940
.. he should be treated well.

864
01:10:07,950 --> 01:10:09,941
What will you take?

865
01:10:10,019 --> 01:10:12,954
Tea, coffee, milk?

866
01:10:13,956 --> 01:10:16,948
Give me water.
l feel very thirsty.

867
01:10:22,965 --> 01:10:24,956
Mahadeo.

868
01:10:26,969 --> 01:10:28,960
Bring a soft drink
for the guest.

869
01:10:32,975 --> 01:10:34,966
Please have a seat. Yes.

870
01:10:42,919 --> 01:10:44,910
Now the answers
to the questions..

871
01:10:44,987 --> 01:10:47,922
.. from the letter.
l want those.

872
01:10:51,928 --> 01:10:55,921
First.. l'll answer your
second question.

873
01:10:55,998 --> 01:10:58,933
Will do, will do.

874
01:10:59,001 --> 01:11:00,935
However it is
convenient to you.

875
01:11:02,004 --> 01:11:04,939
Your second question.

876
01:11:06,943 --> 01:11:08,934
Means, Maruti Kamble.

877
01:11:09,946 --> 01:11:11,937
Master.

878
01:11:12,014 --> 01:11:13,948
Soft drink, sir.

879
01:11:16,118 --> 01:11:17,949
Keep it there.

880
01:11:28,965 --> 01:11:30,956
You should not try to
interfere into..

881
01:11:31,033 --> 01:11:32,967
.. wrong people's
affairs,Master,

882
01:11:33,035 --> 01:11:34,969
You'll regret it.

883
01:11:36,973 --> 01:11:39,908
Throughout my life
l've done this.

884
01:11:41,911 --> 01:11:43,902
l was never counted
amongst the wise people.

885
01:11:44,914 --> 01:11:45,903
l'm an ass.

886
01:11:46,916 --> 01:11:48,907
By birth and a
pure and simple ass.

887
01:11:49,919 --> 01:11:52,911
So don't worry about me at all.

888
01:11:53,923 --> 01:11:55,914
So now tell me once.

889
01:11:55,992 --> 01:11:57,926
Who's this Maruti Kamble?

890
01:11:59,929 --> 01:12:00,918
What happened to him?

891
01:12:40,903 --> 01:12:45,897
O, companion, companion.

892
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:50,902
l'm a wounded deer.

893
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:53,772
Don't trouble your servant.

894
01:12:55,785 --> 01:13:00,779
Master he was just a man,
nothing special about him.

895
01:13:01,791 --> 01:13:02,780
How can that be?

896
01:13:02,858 --> 01:13:05,793
ls it just that, people
are murmuring about him?

897
01:13:05,861 --> 01:13:06,793
People.

898
01:13:06,862 --> 01:13:09,797
Yes, l mean the
people from this place.

899
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,793
During the past days, l heard
this name, so many times..

900
01:13:15,805 --> 01:13:19,798
..that l was wondering
who this great man is.

901
01:13:38,761 --> 01:13:42,754
Boss, what's the address
of this Maruti Kamble?

902
01:13:42,832 --> 01:13:44,766
Master.

903
01:13:44,834 --> 01:13:47,769
lf a man wants to live nicely..

904
01:13:47,837 --> 01:13:52,774
..then he should look
after his own business.

905
01:13:52,842 --> 01:13:55,777
He should eat, drink
and make merry.

906
01:13:56,779 --> 01:13:59,771
Unnecessarily don't interfere
into something else.

907
01:13:59,849 --> 01:14:02,784
lf you had given this advice
at the right time..

908
01:14:03,786 --> 01:14:07,779
..then maybe it
would be beneficial.

909
01:14:10,793 --> 01:14:13,785
You met me 32 yrs. too late.

910
01:14:16,799 --> 01:14:18,790
Where is it late, Master.

911
01:14:18,868 --> 01:14:20,802
Now live here properly.

912
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:22,735
Properly? What do
you mean and how?

913
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:27,732
By not interfering
into anybody's affairs..

914
01:14:28,744 --> 01:14:31,736
..and by doing your own work.

915
01:14:31,814 --> 01:14:34,749
Yes, but l mean by drinking
or without drinking.

916
01:14:35,751 --> 01:14:36,740
That's also important.

917
01:14:37,753 --> 01:14:40,745
And the question of
romance will also arise.

918
01:14:40,823 --> 01:14:44,759
Disgusting, Master! You want
to make romance at this age?

919
01:14:45,761 --> 01:14:49,754
Master, if you worked with me
according to how l say..

920
01:14:49,832 --> 01:14:52,767
..then l'll open up
many things in your name.

921
01:14:52,835 --> 01:14:54,769
lt's not a question of money.

922
01:14:55,771 --> 01:14:57,762
lt's a question
of intelligence and grit.

923
01:14:58,774 --> 01:15:03,768
ln fact Master, we need to
have another high school here.

924
01:15:03,846 --> 01:15:05,780
We need a college.

925
01:15:05,848 --> 01:15:08,783
And a cultural organiZation.

926
01:15:08,851 --> 01:15:10,785
All the things
that are happening..

927
01:15:10,853 --> 01:15:12,787
..in the city should
happen in our area.

928
01:15:12,855 --> 01:15:14,789
l'll spend money like anything.

929
01:15:16,792 --> 01:15:19,784
Master, it's my wish
that a grand library..

930
01:15:19,862 --> 01:15:22,729
..should be opened
in this place.

931
01:15:25,734 --> 01:15:28,726
We'll bring such important
books that learned people..

932
01:15:28,804 --> 01:15:30,738
..from Pune and Mumbai
should come here to read them.

933
01:15:30,806 --> 01:15:32,740
Yes we'll make
it air-conditioned.

934
01:15:32,808 --> 01:15:34,742
Yes, yes.
Air-conditioned.

935
01:15:36,745 --> 01:15:38,736
Just if the name of a
book is mentioned..

936
01:15:38,814 --> 01:15:40,748
..however rare it may be..

937
01:15:40,816 --> 01:15:42,750
lt'll be in our library.

938
01:15:42,818 --> 01:15:44,752
Yes, it'll be. Why not?

939
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:50,756
Master. l'll name that
in my master's name.

940
01:15:50,826 --> 01:15:54,762
Good. my head is reeling
just by hearing this.

941
01:15:55,831 --> 01:15:58,766
What l'm trying
to say, Master..

942
01:15:58,834 --> 01:16:00,768
..that stay honestly with me.

943
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:04,762
You need to have faith.
Then everything is possible.

944
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,775
Close your ears to
whatever people say.

945
01:16:07,843 --> 01:16:09,777
Master, what about the people?

946
01:16:09,845 --> 01:16:11,779
They have mouths
so they'll talk.

947
01:16:11,847 --> 01:16:13,781
You should not listen to them.

948
01:16:16,785 --> 01:16:20,778
ln short it means, l should
not ask who is Maruti Kamble?

949
01:16:20,856 --> 01:16:24,724
Neither should l meet him nor
should even think of him.

950
01:16:24,793 --> 01:16:26,727
Yes, that's right.

951
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:29,721
And as the days pass by..

952
01:16:30,733 --> 01:16:33,725
..you're bound to
learn more. Ok boss.

953
01:16:35,738 --> 01:16:40,732
l'm indebted to.. the advice
and direction imparted by you.

954
01:16:41,744 --> 01:16:43,735
Sit down.

955
01:16:43,812 --> 01:16:46,747
lt's not over as yet.

956
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:49,741
Master.

957
01:16:51,754 --> 01:16:56,748
The answer to your first
question is still pending.

958
01:16:58,761 --> 01:17:00,752
l'll give it to you. Yes.

959
01:17:00,829 --> 01:17:05,766
Now tell me, that if
a man is very hungry..

960
01:17:06,769 --> 01:17:08,760
..will he be able to sleep?

961
01:17:08,837 --> 01:17:10,771
Tell me, will he be able to?

962
01:17:10,839 --> 01:17:11,771
No.

963
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,775
What are the different
types of hunger? Hunger?

964
01:17:16,779 --> 01:17:21,773
Hunger for food,
money, and also of power.

965
01:17:22,718 --> 01:17:26,711
That's very strong.
Hunger for power.

966
01:17:30,759 --> 01:17:32,727
How many types of
hunger does the body have?

967
01:17:32,795 --> 01:17:34,729
Two. Bravo.

968
01:17:35,731 --> 01:17:41,727
Master, if either of
those is very strong..

969
01:17:42,738 --> 01:17:46,731
..then it's impossible
for a man to sleep.

970
01:17:47,743 --> 01:17:50,735
lt means that my hunger
for romance is not strong!?

971
01:17:50,813 --> 01:17:53,748
This is your answer
to my question.

972
01:17:57,753 --> 01:18:02,747
Master, l gave you grams,
but to bite it..

973
01:18:02,825 --> 01:18:05,760
..your teeth are weak.

974
01:18:06,762 --> 01:18:09,754
This happens because
of wine. ls it?

975
01:18:11,767 --> 01:18:13,758
But what's the solution for
this? l will show you.

976
01:18:13,836 --> 01:18:16,771
No, no, why trouble yourself?
You're a busy man.

977
01:18:16,839 --> 01:18:20,775
A busy man thinks
nothing of work, Master.

978
01:18:20,843 --> 01:18:24,711
He does it.
And master..

979
01:18:26,715 --> 01:18:29,707
..how can we not do the work..

980
01:18:29,785 --> 01:18:32,720
..of our own people, isn't it?

981
01:18:32,788 --> 01:18:34,722
Will you come?

982
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:39,725
On Thursday, you have to
accompany me to Mumbai.

983
01:18:40,729 --> 01:18:43,721
We'll leave early
in the morning.

984
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,734
Ok?

985
01:19:16,765 --> 01:19:19,757
Master, that there
is your room.

986
01:19:20,769 --> 01:19:22,703
Take some rest.

987
01:19:22,771 --> 01:19:24,705
We'll see about
your problem later.

988
01:19:47,896 --> 01:19:50,729
What Master, how do you feel?

989
01:19:50,799 --> 01:19:53,734
Like l'm in heaven.

990
01:19:55,738 --> 01:19:58,730
Master, you haven't
had our whiskey.

991
01:20:00,743 --> 01:20:03,735
l'd taken an oath
to have local drinks..

992
01:20:03,812 --> 01:20:05,746
..and l cannot
leave that oath.

993
01:20:06,749 --> 01:20:09,741
Come you local drink, come.

994
01:20:10,753 --> 01:20:13,745
Master, seeing
these activities of mine..

995
01:20:13,822 --> 01:20:16,757
..you must be
surprised, isn't it?

996
01:20:45,721 --> 01:20:48,713
Master, l used to
do it sometimes.

997
01:20:49,725 --> 01:20:53,718
The reason is that,
lust is a wild lion.

998
01:20:53,796 --> 01:20:56,731
Very dangerous man-eating lion.

999
01:20:57,733 --> 01:20:59,724
Whoever got trapped
in its claws..

1000
01:20:59,802 --> 01:21:01,736
..has never escaped.

1001
01:21:02,738 --> 01:21:06,731
Real men should
ride on this lion.

1002
01:21:06,809 --> 01:21:08,743
l'm doing this here in Mumbai.

1003
01:21:08,811 --> 01:21:10,745
But l'm not addicted to it.

1004
01:21:11,814 --> 01:21:14,749
l'm proudly stroking its
mane and using it as l want.

1005
01:21:15,751 --> 01:21:20,745
And master in doing so, my
self confidence gets strong.

1006
01:21:32,768 --> 01:21:36,761
l've never told
you before Master..

1007
01:21:36,939 --> 01:21:38,770
..but now l'm telling you.

1008
01:21:40,776 --> 01:21:43,768
l'm not content in my house.

1009
01:21:43,846 --> 01:21:46,781
Although there
are people, l'm alone.

1010
01:21:47,783 --> 01:21:49,774
l'm involving myself in work.

1011
01:21:50,786 --> 01:21:53,778
But Master my
loneliness doesn't go.

1012
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:57,782
l like your friendship.

1013
01:21:57,860 --> 01:21:59,794
Apart from that
l have no friends.

1014
01:21:59,862 --> 01:22:01,796
All of them are selfish.

1015
01:22:03,298 --> 01:22:07,792
Master, as you're
not afraid of me you'll..

1016
01:22:07,870 --> 01:22:11,806
.. either be my
friend, or my foe.

1017
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:18,803
Who are you of mine today,
l do not know.

1018
01:22:20,816 --> 01:22:22,750
But master..

1019
01:22:23,752 --> 01:22:27,745
..l'm treating you
as my friend.

1020
01:22:29,758 --> 01:22:33,751
Master, you must
respond to my friendship?

1021
01:22:56,785 --> 01:22:59,777
What master, how did
you like the girl.

1022
01:22:59,855 --> 01:23:01,789
lsn't she good?

1023
01:23:02,791 --> 01:23:06,784
You're tired just by watching.
The full night is there ahead.

1024
01:23:06,862 --> 01:23:10,798
The trip atop the
lion is still pending?

1025
01:23:10,866 --> 01:23:13,801
Don't you want the
answer to your question?

1026
01:23:21,810 --> 01:23:25,746
Did you bring me
here only for sitting?

1027
01:23:25,814 --> 01:23:28,749
lf you can't do anything, at
least give me the glass filled.

1028
01:23:28,817 --> 01:23:30,751
lts not good for
ladies to drink.

1029
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:34,755
Listen to me, don't drink wine.
l'll bring milk for you.

1030
01:23:34,823 --> 01:23:37,758
No, no, no, don't drink wine.

1031
01:23:37,826 --> 01:23:40,761
Kamle, Kamle,
girl listen to me?

1032
01:23:40,829 --> 01:23:42,763
From morning you've
not taken anything.

1033
01:23:42,831 --> 01:23:45,766
At least take the milk?
Kamle, you listen to me.

1034
01:23:45,834 --> 01:23:49,770
lf you don't take milk,
then l really won't leave you.

1035
01:24:10,792 --> 01:24:13,784
They say that Rs. 5000 you
sent to Balasaheb in Mumbai..

1036
01:24:13,862 --> 01:24:15,796
..he spent it all on
gambling in one night.

1037
01:24:31,747 --> 01:24:34,739
Jaisingh Rao,
the leadership must change.

1038
01:24:34,816 --> 01:24:36,750
Hindurao alone
cannot rule always.

1039
01:24:36,818 --> 01:24:38,752
Tell the secretary.

1040
01:24:46,762 --> 01:24:50,755
The election
should be unopposed.

1041
01:24:51,767 --> 01:24:53,758
Spend as much
money as you want.

1042
01:25:49,758 --> 01:25:51,749
Master, you're intelligent.

1043
01:25:51,827 --> 01:25:53,761
But not a man.

1044
01:25:53,829 --> 01:25:55,763
You just go on drinking.

1045
01:25:55,831 --> 01:25:58,766
You have no guts
to mount the lion.

1046
01:27:01,763 --> 01:27:07,759
My dear social artistic
brothers and sisters.

1047
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:12,763
This tradition of live stage
folks drama is alive..

1048
01:27:12,841 --> 01:27:16,777
..in Maharashtra for
so many years.

1049
01:27:17,779 --> 01:27:20,771
Now there's TV.

1050
01:27:21,783 --> 01:27:25,719
There's your cinema.
every day new plays take place.

1051
01:27:25,787 --> 01:27:28,722
But in the villages,
where there is a population..

1052
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:31,725
..in the thousands..

1053
01:27:31,793 --> 01:27:34,728
..this live stage
folk drama is the only..

1054
01:27:34,796 --> 01:27:37,731
.. accepted medium of culture.

1055
01:27:38,733 --> 01:27:42,726
When you see a Marathi movie,
you will see that..

1056
01:27:43,738 --> 01:27:46,730
..no film is completed
without having a scene..

1057
01:27:46,808 --> 01:27:49,743
..of our folk drama in it.

1058
01:27:51,746 --> 01:27:54,738
lt's in lndra isn't it?
About the cultural art academy.

1059
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:58,742
They felicitated
their lnduri brothers.

1060
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:00,754
ln the ass's wedding.

1061
01:28:01,756 --> 01:28:04,748
l welcome that academy.

1062
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:09,753
So also l wish and
pray that many of our..

1063
01:28:09,931 --> 01:28:14,766
..too may be
accepted and felicitated.

1064
01:28:15,770 --> 01:28:17,761
Jai Maharashtra.
Jai Hind.

1065
01:28:34,723 --> 01:28:39,717
O my beloved let's go and play
with colors in the garden.

1066
01:28:40,729 --> 01:28:45,723
O my beloved let's go and play
with colors in the garden.

1067
01:29:18,767 --> 01:29:23,704
Take the red color
in your hand.

1068
01:29:23,772 --> 01:29:26,707
And throw it on my chest.

1069
01:29:27,709 --> 01:29:31,702
The color filled
sprayer is in your hand.

1070
01:29:32,714 --> 01:29:35,706
And it makes me wet.

1071
01:29:36,718 --> 01:29:41,712
Like Shripati
plays in Vrindavan.

1072
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:45,726
Taking the gopis along.

1073
01:29:50,732 --> 01:29:55,726
And you hold me close.

1074
01:29:57,739 --> 01:29:59,730
ls it so? And.

1075
01:30:00,742 --> 01:30:05,736
O my beloved, let's go and
play with colors in the garden.

1076
01:30:06,815 --> 01:30:11,752
O my beloved, let's go and
play with colors in the garden.

1077
01:30:37,712 --> 01:30:41,705
You wear bright red clothes.

1078
01:30:41,783 --> 01:30:45,719
And you ride the chariot.

1079
01:30:47,722 --> 01:30:51,715
Give me your call my lord.

1080
01:30:52,727 --> 01:30:56,720
And l'll come at once.

1081
01:30:56,798 --> 01:31:00,734
You like my red ruby.

1082
01:31:01,736 --> 01:31:04,728
lt suits her body.

1083
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:08,732
See, it suits her body.

1084
01:31:09,744 --> 01:31:14,738
Now take me..

1085
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:17,741
..to the royal suite.

1086
01:31:17,819 --> 01:31:20,754
Let's do it. And.

1087
01:31:21,756 --> 01:31:44,773
O my beloved, let's go and
play with colors in the garden.

1088
01:31:55,790 --> 01:31:57,781
Master, we placed the
responsibility on you..

1089
01:31:57,859 --> 01:31:59,793
..and you betrayed us.

1090
01:31:59,861 --> 01:32:01,795
You have bungled the money.

1091
01:32:01,863 --> 01:32:04,798
Yesterday, there was a
shortage of Rs.41 1 .50 paise.

1092
01:32:08,803 --> 01:32:11,795
What happened to this money?

1093
01:32:29,757 --> 01:32:33,750
Can l drink this
water? Take it.

1094
01:32:35,763 --> 01:32:38,755
But the consequences of these
incident will be grave, Master.

1095
01:32:43,771 --> 01:32:47,764
l'm grateful. You could
be charged with fraud.

1096
01:32:49,777 --> 01:32:51,768
What have you got
to say about this?

1097
01:32:52,847 --> 01:32:54,781
Write it down.

1098
01:32:58,786 --> 01:33:00,777
Do l have to tell?

1099
01:33:03,791 --> 01:33:06,783
There is a bungling
of the money.

1100
01:33:07,795 --> 01:33:10,787
How did it happen,
l don't know.

1101
01:33:10,865 --> 01:33:13,800
As usual l was drunk.

1102
01:33:13,868 --> 01:33:16,803
So l can't remember anything.

1103
01:33:18,806 --> 01:33:21,798
But if it is proved,
that l'm guilty..

1104
01:33:22,744 --> 01:33:25,736
..then l'm willing to
face the consequences.

1105
01:33:27,749 --> 01:33:29,740
l'll have to face it.

1106
01:33:31,753 --> 01:33:33,744
Sign here.

1107
01:33:47,769 --> 01:33:49,760
Go, go out.

1108
01:33:51,773 --> 01:33:53,764
Don't go to work.

1109
01:34:06,788 --> 01:34:08,779
Send the complainant in.

1110
01:34:08,856 --> 01:34:11,791
And do what
l tell you to do further.

1111
01:34:19,801 --> 01:34:23,737
Master, we will have to hand
you over to the police.

1112
01:34:25,740 --> 01:34:27,731
As you wish.

1113
01:34:36,751 --> 01:34:39,743
Salutations, sir.
l'm Zhadbuke speaking.

1114
01:34:39,821 --> 01:34:42,756
Has the investigation
finished in the Master case?

1115
01:34:42,824 --> 01:34:44,758
Yes. The crime has
been confessed, sir.

1116
01:34:44,826 --> 01:34:47,761
Ok. So what're
we doing further?

1117
01:34:47,829 --> 01:34:49,763
What else, sir?

1118
01:34:49,831 --> 01:34:51,765
The case has to
be sent to the police.

1119
01:34:51,833 --> 01:34:54,768
Nirmalkar inspector is here.

1120
01:34:54,836 --> 01:34:57,771
He's saying he'll take master
into police custody.

1121
01:35:06,781 --> 01:35:09,773
He's bringing the money?
Will he reach by then?

1122
01:35:10,785 --> 01:35:12,776
You're asking to
take the case back?

1123
01:35:12,854 --> 01:35:15,789
Right sir. Ok sir.

1124
01:35:16,457 --> 01:35:17,788
l'll carry out
your orders sir.

1125
01:35:23,731 --> 01:35:25,722
This is Rs. 413.

1126
01:35:26,734 --> 01:35:28,725
Please sit,
sit Mr.Sarjerao sir.

1127
01:35:28,803 --> 01:35:30,737
l have no time.

1128
01:35:34,742 --> 01:35:37,734
Master. At least
now, stay nicely.

1129
01:35:37,812 --> 01:35:40,747
Stop unnecessary inquiries.
Or else you'll repent.

1130
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:44,741
See Master. Because of
Hindurao sir you got saved.

1131
01:35:44,819 --> 01:35:46,753
Otherwise you would have been
breaking stones now.

1132
01:35:48,756 --> 01:35:51,748
lt's the greatness of
Hindurao sir. What else.

1133
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:54,751
l got saved.

1134
01:35:54,829 --> 01:35:56,763
Who's Hindurao sir.

1135
01:35:56,831 --> 01:35:57,763
Leave me.

1136
01:35:57,832 --> 01:35:59,766
He paid Rs. 413.

1137
01:36:01,769 --> 01:36:04,761
Or else l'd have
been in prison.

1138
01:36:05,773 --> 01:36:07,764
But Hindurao.

1139
01:36:07,842 --> 01:36:09,776
No Hindurao sir.

1140
01:36:10,778 --> 01:36:12,769
That Maruti Kamble
has fallen into trouble.

1141
01:36:12,847 --> 01:36:15,782
Yes he has become
the scapegoat of politics.

1142
01:36:15,850 --> 01:36:17,784
He was innocent. Yes?

1143
01:36:17,852 --> 01:36:20,787
But what happened to his
parents? ls there any news?

1144
01:36:20,855 --> 01:36:22,720
They're staying in Maharwada.
What a luck they have.

1145
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:24,724
Their only son.

1146
01:36:24,792 --> 01:36:26,726
They say that he
has returned from the war.

1147
01:36:26,794 --> 01:36:29,729
He's lucky to be here.
He should stay peacefully.

1148
01:36:29,797 --> 01:36:32,732
Yes baba, but they
have contacts on top.

1149
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:36,736
Nobody will ask for you
and me. C'mon lets go.

1150
01:36:42,744 --> 01:36:44,735
Maruti Kamble.

1151
01:36:46,748 --> 01:36:49,740
Maruti Kamble is finished.

1152
01:36:50,752 --> 01:36:52,743
Maruti Kamble..

1153
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:54,754
..is finished.

1154
01:36:55,757 --> 01:36:57,748
ln the army,
he didn't give up.

1155
01:36:57,825 --> 01:36:59,759
even though he lost a leg..

1156
01:36:59,827 --> 01:37:01,761
..yet he fought like a tiger.

1157
01:37:01,829 --> 01:37:02,761
You know?

1158
01:37:02,830 --> 01:37:04,764
Say if you know.

1159
01:37:04,832 --> 01:37:06,766
What happened to him?

1160
01:37:06,834 --> 01:37:08,768
Maruti Kamle brave soldier.

1161
01:37:09,771 --> 01:37:11,762
What happened to him?

1162
01:37:12,774 --> 01:37:14,765
Will he come? He won't come.

1163
01:37:15,777 --> 01:37:18,769
Because none of
us know about it.

1164
01:37:19,781 --> 01:37:23,717
Shhh! That's a secret, secret.

1165
01:37:29,724 --> 01:37:32,716
You tell me. Tell me.

1166
01:37:32,794 --> 01:37:34,728
What happened to Maruti Kamble?

1167
01:37:34,796 --> 01:37:36,730
Tell me.

1168
01:37:37,732 --> 01:37:40,724
What will you tell?
You don't have the guts.

1169
01:37:41,736 --> 01:37:43,727
Because you also don't know.

1170
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:49,733
Maruti went to heaven.

1171
01:37:50,745 --> 01:37:54,738
Maruti Kamble who lost
his one leg is gone.

1172
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:58,742
He's gone to another world.
Hey madman.

1173
01:38:00,755 --> 01:38:03,747
Bloody drunkard.
Says what he likes.

1174
01:38:36,724 --> 01:38:39,716
lf you interfere in Maruti
Kamble's case, you are dead.

1175
01:38:39,794 --> 01:38:42,729
Your pieces too will
not be found.

1176
01:38:42,797 --> 01:38:43,729
Say it.

1177
01:38:43,898 --> 01:38:46,731
You won't interfere
in Maruti Kamble's case.

1178
01:38:46,801 --> 01:38:49,736
Or else l'll raise my hand.
Throw him down.

1179
01:38:49,804 --> 01:38:51,738
We'll stand on his chest
and pull his intestines.

1180
01:38:51,806 --> 01:38:53,740
Say.

1181
01:38:56,744 --> 01:38:59,736
Say it. Say it. Say it.

1182
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:04,741
Ok. ok. Say God promise.

1183
01:39:05,753 --> 01:39:07,744
God promise. God promise?

1184
01:39:07,822 --> 01:39:09,756
God promise, l won't interfere.

1185
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:14,751
C'mon.

1186
01:39:36,717 --> 01:39:40,710
Why are you living in the
world, useless fellow, why?

1187
01:39:42,723 --> 01:39:44,714
What's left of yours now?

1188
01:39:46,727 --> 01:39:48,718
Whom do you want to show?

1189
01:39:48,796 --> 01:39:50,730
Whom?

1190
01:40:17,758 --> 01:40:22,695
Kamle. Appa.

1191
01:40:24,699 --> 01:40:26,690
Kamle, don't run wait.

1192
01:40:26,767 --> 01:40:29,702
Kamle. Appa.

1193
01:40:57,732 --> 01:41:03,728
All the lamps have gone off.

1194
01:41:04,739 --> 01:41:09,733
lnto the darkness of the trees.

1195
01:41:10,745 --> 01:41:16,741
All the lamps have gone off.

1196
01:41:16,817 --> 01:41:22,756
lnto the darkness of the trees.

1197
01:41:23,758 --> 01:41:28,752
From life it takes a bet.

1198
01:41:29,764 --> 01:41:34,758
Still there is a
cloud of darkness.

1199
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:38,762
On somebody's shoulders..

1200
01:41:38,939 --> 01:41:43,774
..there is somebody's burden.

1201
01:41:44,779 --> 01:41:48,772
On somebody's shoulders..

1202
01:41:48,949 --> 01:41:52,783
..there is somebody's burden.

1203
01:42:53,447 --> 01:42:54,778
Stay as you are.

1204
01:43:02,790 --> 01:43:04,781
What Master?

1205
01:43:05,793 --> 01:43:07,784
l had warned you
not to interfere..

1206
01:43:07,862 --> 01:43:09,796
..into the affairs of others.

1207
01:43:11,799 --> 01:43:14,791
See what has happened to you.

1208
01:43:14,869 --> 01:43:18,805
Why did you go to die to that
Datta's hill, last night?

1209
01:43:20,808 --> 01:43:22,742
Just like that.

1210
01:43:24,745 --> 01:43:30,741
But what were those men doing
in the darkness there?

1211
01:43:32,753 --> 01:43:36,746
l became
unconscious immediately.

1212
01:43:38,759 --> 01:43:41,751
My men were behind you.

1213
01:43:43,764 --> 01:43:46,756
And this is my clear opinion..

1214
01:43:46,834 --> 01:43:48,768
..you didn't do right.

1215
01:43:50,771 --> 01:43:53,763
You always do good.

1216
01:43:53,841 --> 01:43:55,775
l am the bad man.

1217
01:43:58,779 --> 01:44:01,771
You only did
good for Maruti Kamble?

1218
01:44:03,784 --> 01:44:05,775
Yes.

1219
01:44:05,953 --> 01:44:08,786
Master we take
care of our people.

1220
01:44:08,856 --> 01:44:10,790
We give them life.

1221
01:44:12,793 --> 01:44:15,785
Kamble burnt
my house and looted it.

1222
01:44:15,863 --> 01:44:17,797
But l forgave him.

1223
01:44:18,799 --> 01:44:20,790
l'm a generous and kind man.

1224
01:44:21,802 --> 01:44:24,737
But he worked against me.

1225
01:44:24,805 --> 01:44:26,739
He wanted to break the union.

1226
01:44:26,807 --> 01:44:28,741
l'll never tolerate that.

1227
01:44:30,411 --> 01:44:33,744
Master, previously l was bad.

1228
01:44:33,814 --> 01:44:35,748
But today l'm not like that.

1229
01:44:35,816 --> 01:44:39,752
even Valmiki was
not Valmiki at birth.

1230
01:44:40,821 --> 01:44:42,755
For the past so many
years l'm shedding..

1231
01:44:42,823 --> 01:44:44,757
..my blood for the
betterment of this place.

1232
01:44:45,759 --> 01:44:47,750
But Kamble didn't want that.

1233
01:44:49,930 --> 01:44:52,763
He wanted to rule this place
through malicious means.

1234
01:44:56,770 --> 01:44:58,761
And because of that
you got him killed?

1235
01:44:59,773 --> 01:45:04,767
Yes. But before that,
l explained to him nicely.

1236
01:45:04,845 --> 01:45:08,781
Then l threatened him.
l gave him Rs.15000 cash.

1237
01:45:10,784 --> 01:45:12,775
But he didn't listen.

1238
01:45:13,787 --> 01:45:16,779
Then l finished him.

1239
01:45:20,794 --> 01:45:22,728
But still if somebody inquires..

1240
01:45:22,796 --> 01:45:24,730
..about him you get scared.

1241
01:45:30,738 --> 01:45:34,731
l'm not scared,
Master, l'm cautious.

1242
01:45:35,743 --> 01:45:38,735
ln my place, l don't want
double standard people.

1243
01:45:40,748 --> 01:45:43,740
l don't want nonsense
and politics here.

1244
01:45:44,752 --> 01:45:47,744
Any job, which is
done with one voice..

1245
01:45:47,821 --> 01:45:49,755
..then it can be done 100%.

1246
01:45:49,823 --> 01:45:52,758
This is what l feel.
This is what l believe.

1247
01:45:54,762 --> 01:45:58,755
So learn from what
has happened to Kamble.

1248
01:45:59,767 --> 01:46:01,758
Why are you making me angry?

1249
01:46:01,835 --> 01:46:03,769
You're living off me.

1250
01:46:04,772 --> 01:46:06,763
This is not my nature.

1251
01:46:07,775 --> 01:46:10,767
When l find a question,
l have to find an answer.

1252
01:46:11,779 --> 01:46:13,770
This is my old habit.

1253
01:46:16,450 --> 01:46:18,782
When it was said that
the sun will never set..

1254
01:46:18,852 --> 01:46:21,787
..on the British empire..

1255
01:46:22,723 --> 01:46:26,716
..l spent my entire life
trying to find this out, boss.

1256
01:46:27,728 --> 01:46:29,719
When l got to know
that there are two..

1257
01:46:29,797 --> 01:46:31,731
..answers to one question
then l came to know..

1258
01:46:31,799 --> 01:46:34,734
..that the sun also sets
on the British empire.

1259
01:46:36,236 --> 01:46:38,727
Whenever the sun
rises on any empire..

1260
01:46:38,806 --> 01:46:41,741
Then it will definitely
set at sometime.

1261
01:46:46,747 --> 01:46:48,738
lt's an old habit.

1262
01:46:48,816 --> 01:46:50,750
How can it go?

1263
01:46:51,251 --> 01:46:54,743
Master, l'm giving
you a last chance.

1264
01:46:55,756 --> 01:47:00,750
Leave this place and go.

1265
01:47:07,768 --> 01:47:09,759
How many thousands
will you give me?

1266
01:47:09,837 --> 01:47:12,772
l mean will give me more
than what you gave him?

1267
01:47:18,779 --> 01:47:21,771
He was worth 15000.

1268
01:47:23,717 --> 01:47:26,709
l'm giving you 5000.

1269
01:47:28,722 --> 01:47:30,713
So less.

1270
01:47:30,791 --> 01:47:33,726
Taking into consideration
our loving relationship.

1271
01:47:38,732 --> 01:47:40,723
Make it 6.

1272
01:47:41,735 --> 01:47:43,726
Ok 7. ls it ok?

1273
01:47:45,739 --> 01:47:47,730
Give me 7.5.

1274
01:47:51,745 --> 01:47:53,736
Agreed.

1275
01:47:54,748 --> 01:47:57,740
But tomorrow you should
not be seen here.

1276
01:47:59,420 --> 01:48:00,751
Ok boss.

1277
01:48:01,755 --> 01:48:03,746
Tomorrow morning, l will
not be within the limits..

1278
01:48:03,824 --> 01:48:05,758
.. of your area.

1279
01:48:05,826 --> 01:48:07,760
This is my word.

1280
01:48:08,762 --> 01:48:10,753
Now tell me only once, boss.

1281
01:48:11,765 --> 01:48:14,757
What exactly have
you done to Maruti Kamble?

1282
01:48:15,769 --> 01:48:18,761
How did you finish him?

1283
01:48:25,712 --> 01:48:28,704
Will you promise
you won' tell anybody?

1284
01:48:28,782 --> 01:48:30,716
Yes.

1285
01:48:36,723 --> 01:48:38,714
Ok.

1286
01:48:43,730 --> 01:48:46,722
When l came to know
that Maruti Kamble won't..

1287
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:48,734
..listen under any condition.

1288
01:48:49,736 --> 01:48:51,727
Then l decided.

1289
01:48:52,739 --> 01:48:55,731
That he should be
moved out of the way.

1290
01:49:00,747 --> 01:49:02,738
l didn't want to do it.

1291
01:49:03,750 --> 01:49:05,741
But there was no other way.

1292
01:49:07,754 --> 01:49:11,747
And one has to
sacrifice one's self..

1293
01:49:11,925 --> 01:49:16,760
..for the benefit of others.

1294
01:49:18,765 --> 01:49:20,756
ln a way Kamble
was a kind man.

1295
01:49:20,834 --> 01:49:22,699
He was brave.

1296
01:49:24,705 --> 01:49:26,696
l thought..

1297
01:49:29,710 --> 01:49:34,704
..that until and unless
l don't accuse him..

1298
01:49:35,716 --> 01:49:38,708
..in a big case, it'll be
difficult for the people..

1299
01:49:38,785 --> 01:49:41,720
..to accept his disappearance
from the village.

1300
01:49:45,392 --> 01:49:46,723
l was looking for
an opportunity.

1301
01:49:52,733 --> 01:49:57,727
Salunke's widow was
in the village.

1302
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:01,731
She was pregnant.

1303
01:50:04,745 --> 01:50:07,737
While taking drugs
for an abortion she died.

1304
01:50:10,751 --> 01:50:13,743
She died in the night,
and we came to know about it.

1305
01:50:15,756 --> 01:50:18,748
ln the night itself
we called the police.

1306
01:50:24,364 --> 01:50:28,698
Police came and
they did the panchnama.

1307
01:50:30,704 --> 01:50:33,696
Suili gave a statement
that Maruti Kamble ..

1308
01:50:33,874 --> 01:50:39,710
..had brought that
lady to Suili's place.

1309
01:50:41,715 --> 01:50:43,706
And that he had
paid her in advance.

1310
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:49,712
l had made that
arrangement with Suili..

1311
01:50:49,790 --> 01:50:51,724
..by paying her money.

1312
01:50:55,729 --> 01:50:57,720
A warrant was issued in
the name of Maruti Kamble..

1313
01:50:57,798 --> 01:50:59,732
..in the morning itself.

1314
01:51:03,737 --> 01:51:05,728
My plan worked well.

1315
01:51:07,741 --> 01:51:11,734
Maruti Kamble disappeared
from the village.

1316
01:51:13,747 --> 01:51:16,739
Or else the villagers
would have burnt him alive.

1317
01:51:18,752 --> 01:51:23,746
Because ..the widow
was of Salunke.

1318
01:51:25,759 --> 01:51:27,750
He ran away.

1319
01:51:27,828 --> 01:51:31,764
But still my men were
always on the lookout.

1320
01:51:33,767 --> 01:51:35,758
l sent to call for him.

1321
01:51:37,771 --> 01:51:40,763
Because this was..

1322
01:51:40,841 --> 01:51:43,776
..the best time
to make a deal.

1323
01:52:02,796 --> 01:52:07,790
What a palace is this.

1324
01:52:08,802 --> 01:52:13,796
There is forest around

1325
01:52:14,808 --> 01:52:20,804
There is darkness all around.

1326
01:52:21,815 --> 01:52:25,751
And l can't find the way.

1327
01:52:26,753 --> 01:52:33,750
ln this dark night.

1328
01:52:35,762 --> 01:52:38,754
Somebody was plotting.

1329
01:52:38,832 --> 01:52:41,767
A vicious act.

1330
01:52:42,769 --> 01:52:47,763
O companion,
l'm a wounded deer.

1331
01:52:47,841 --> 01:52:54,770
O companion,
l'm a wounded deer.

1332
01:53:24,745 --> 01:53:29,739
The night is black
like the collyrium.

1333
01:53:30,751 --> 01:53:34,744
And my body is shivering.

1334
01:53:41,762 --> 01:53:44,754
And my body is shivering.

1335
01:53:46,767 --> 01:53:50,760
There is no sign
of shimmering leaves.

1336
01:53:51,772 --> 01:53:55,765
And the glow worms.

1337
01:53:56,777 --> 01:53:59,769
Where will l hide?

1338
01:53:59,846 --> 01:54:01,780
How will l hide?

1339
01:54:02,783 --> 01:54:10,781
l am perplexed.

1340
01:54:12,793 --> 01:54:22,725
O companion,
l'm a wounded deer.

1341
01:54:23,737 --> 01:54:28,731
O companion,
l'm a wounded deer.

1342
01:54:49,763 --> 01:54:54,757
l got secret
feelings on my face.

1343
01:54:55,769 --> 01:54:59,762
And strange look in my eyes.

1344
01:55:00,774 --> 01:55:05,768
l got secret
feelings on my face.

1345
01:55:05,846 --> 01:55:10,783
And strange look in my eyes.

1346
01:55:11,785 --> 01:55:15,778
What has transpired by nature.

1347
01:55:16,790 --> 01:55:20,783
For you and for me.

1348
01:55:21,795 --> 01:55:24,730
Where will l run?

1349
01:55:24,798 --> 01:55:26,732
How l run?

1350
01:55:27,734 --> 01:55:36,733
l got lost.

1351
01:55:38,745 --> 01:55:47,744
O companion,
l'm a wounded deer.

1352
01:55:49,756 --> 01:55:58,755
O companion,
l'm a wounded deer.

1353
01:56:02,769 --> 01:56:04,760
Then what was happening
near the mountain?

1354
01:56:05,772 --> 01:56:07,763
Suili's corpse.

1355
01:56:07,841 --> 01:56:09,775
How's that?

1356
01:56:09,843 --> 01:56:12,778
Master, you started
making a noise about Kamble.

1357
01:56:12,846 --> 01:56:14,780
ln the village.

1358
01:56:14,848 --> 01:56:16,782
So the people
started gossiping.

1359
01:56:18,785 --> 01:56:22,721
That Suili's
case went haywire.

1360
01:56:23,723 --> 01:56:27,716
Then we killed and buried that
old lady.. on that night.

1361
01:56:28,728 --> 01:56:30,719
The same night..

1362
01:56:30,797 --> 01:56:32,731
..that you went
near the mountain.

1363
01:56:32,799 --> 01:56:35,734
Boss. Are you satisfied?

1364
01:56:37,737 --> 01:56:40,729
Now leave my place
and go immediately.

1365
01:56:40,807 --> 01:56:43,742
You'll get the
money while leaving.

1366
01:56:44,744 --> 01:56:46,735
This is my word.

1367
01:56:48,748 --> 01:56:52,741
Boss, it's enough for me
to leave your place.

1368
01:56:55,755 --> 01:56:57,746
l do not want your money.

1369
01:57:07,767 --> 01:57:09,758
Has he gone out
of the area limit?

1370
01:57:09,836 --> 01:57:12,771
Yes. l saw.

1371
01:57:12,839 --> 01:57:13,771
He's really gone.

1372
01:57:14,774 --> 01:57:19,768
When a person is
born, he has to die.

1373
01:57:20,780 --> 01:57:25,717
The string of suffering is
like an empty tomb.

1374
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:31,714
When a person is
born, he has to die.

1375
01:57:32,726 --> 01:57:38,722
The strings of Suffering
are like an empty tomb.

1376
01:57:39,733 --> 01:57:44,727
He has to account
for his deeds.

1377
01:57:45,739 --> 01:57:50,733
However small to God.

1378
01:57:51,745 --> 01:57:56,739
On somebody's shoulders..

1379
01:57:56,816 --> 01:58:00,752
.. there is somebody's load.

1380
01:58:19,773 --> 01:58:22,708
Did you get the letter?
lt's in front of me, sir.

1381
01:58:22,776 --> 01:58:25,711
The man looks serious.
Without a doubt, sir.

1382
01:58:26,713 --> 01:58:28,704
He has sent the copies
of the letter to the CM.

1383
01:58:29,382 --> 01:58:30,713
lt is mentioned in the letter.

1384
01:58:30,784 --> 01:58:32,718
You maintain a strict watch.

1385
01:58:33,386 --> 01:58:35,718
Hindurao's people may
try to do something.

1386
01:58:35,789 --> 01:58:37,723
Now the responsibility is on us.

1387
01:58:37,791 --> 01:58:40,726
Be very vigilant. Ok?

1388
01:58:40,794 --> 01:58:44,730
Don't worry sir. l'll
personally warn Hindurao.

1389
01:58:48,735 --> 01:58:51,727
Are you saying that
Maruti Kamble was killed?

1390
01:58:52,739 --> 01:58:54,730
l'm only saying that
police should investigate..

1391
01:58:54,908 --> 01:58:57,741
..the grave allegations
he was accused of.

1392
01:58:59,746 --> 01:59:02,738
But where is he?
That should be found out.

1393
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:05,741
lt's possible
for the police to do this.

1394
01:59:05,819 --> 01:59:08,754
But, why do you feel that this
matter should be probed?

1395
01:59:08,822 --> 01:59:11,757
Yes why should it be?
For justice.

1396
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:15,751
Maruti Kamble was
a brave soldier..

1397
01:59:15,829 --> 01:59:17,763
..who had fought
bravely in the war..

1398
01:59:17,831 --> 01:59:21,767
..and he was accused of
causing the death of a widow.

1399
01:59:22,702 --> 01:59:24,693
The death of a woman in
suspicious circumstances..

1400
01:59:24,771 --> 01:59:26,705
.. must be probed.

1401
01:59:26,773 --> 01:59:29,708
lf Maruti is guilty,
then he should be punished.

1402
01:59:31,711 --> 01:59:33,702
First this case
was registered and later..

1403
01:59:33,780 --> 01:59:35,714
.. the investigation stopped.
Why did it stop?

1404
01:59:36,716 --> 01:59:38,377
That should be done.

1405
01:59:38,718 --> 01:59:40,709
lnvestigation must be done.

1406
01:59:40,787 --> 01:59:42,721
We demand it.

1407
01:59:42,789 --> 01:59:44,723
lnvestigation must be done

1408
01:59:50,730 --> 01:59:53,722
What our Master has said
is absolutely right.

1409
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:55,734
The probe must
be carried out..

1410
01:59:55,802 --> 01:59:57,736
About the crime committed
by Maruti Kamble.

1411
01:59:58,738 --> 02:00:01,730
Are we sheep ah?
That anybody can kill us?

1412
02:00:01,808 --> 02:00:04,743
Are we just like that?
l'm repeating it.

1413
02:00:04,811 --> 02:00:06,745
The government must
take the initiative..

1414
02:00:06,813 --> 02:00:08,747
..to probe
this Kamble's case.

1415
02:01:01,734 --> 02:01:04,726
Yes trunking party.
Call Mr. Collector.

1416
02:01:04,804 --> 02:01:07,739
Yes. You got it?

1417
02:01:10,743 --> 02:01:12,734
Salutations Mr. Collector

1418
02:01:13,746 --> 02:01:16,738
l'm Hindurao Dhonde Patil
speaking. Who Hindurao?

1419
02:01:17,750 --> 02:01:19,741
Tell me. What can
l do for you?

1420
02:01:19,819 --> 02:01:22,754
What can l tell you, sir?

1421
02:01:22,822 --> 02:01:25,757
Yes.. that.. sir,
you must be knowing..

1422
02:01:25,825 --> 02:01:28,760
About the problem l'm facing.

1423
02:01:29,829 --> 02:01:31,763
Problem?

1424
02:01:31,831 --> 02:01:33,765
Yes, isn't it near your Zilla?

1425
02:01:33,833 --> 02:01:36,768
Zilla? Ok, ok.

1426
02:01:36,836 --> 02:01:38,770
You're talking
about master's protest.

1427
02:01:38,838 --> 02:01:41,773
Yes. l'm saying,
why can't you pick him up?

1428
02:01:41,841 --> 02:01:43,775
Yes, charge him. Arrest him.

1429
02:01:43,843 --> 02:01:47,779
l'm aware about you.
Moreover we have pressure..

1430
02:01:47,847 --> 02:01:50,782
..from above regarding
the probe of Maruti Kamble.

1431
02:01:50,850 --> 02:01:52,784
The matter has gone
too far Hindurao.

1432
02:01:52,852 --> 02:01:54,786
l make you aware

1433
02:01:54,854 --> 02:01:56,788
You be careful.

1434
02:02:01,794 --> 02:02:05,787
Then sir, please
suggest a way out.

1435
02:02:05,865 --> 02:02:07,799
Are you asking now?

1436
02:02:07,867 --> 02:02:09,801
Now it is too late.

1437
02:02:09,869 --> 02:02:11,803
You should have
known about it.

1438
02:02:15,808 --> 02:02:18,800
Hey Khacha, l had some
important work with you.

1439
02:02:19,812 --> 02:02:21,803
No l thought it is Rupkane.

1440
02:02:44,771 --> 02:02:46,762
l'm Hindarao
Dhonde Patil speaking.

1441
02:02:46,839 --> 02:02:50,775
Oh! Who Hindurao?

1442
02:02:50,843 --> 02:02:52,777
What are you saying?

1443
02:02:53,780 --> 02:02:55,771
Many days have
passed since we had..

1444
02:02:55,848 --> 02:02:57,782
..a good party at your house.

1445
02:02:57,850 --> 02:02:59,784
l feel something missing.

1446
02:03:00,787 --> 02:03:03,779
How did you call
this poor man today, sir?

1447
02:03:04,791 --> 02:03:08,784
Regarding master's protest.
Yes that is there isn't it?

1448
02:03:09,796 --> 02:03:13,789
You gave a speech too there.
So what about it?

1449
02:03:14,801 --> 02:03:16,792
You spoke against me.

1450
02:03:18,805 --> 02:03:20,796
You're just
imagining it Hindurao.

1451
02:03:20,873 --> 02:03:23,740
l just backed the
demand for a probe.

1452
02:03:23,810 --> 02:03:26,745
Because others backed
it l was helpless.

1453
02:03:27,747 --> 02:03:30,739
Hindurao, isn't this politics?

1454
02:03:30,817 --> 02:03:34,753
Yes, l too know
something about politics.

1455
02:03:35,755 --> 02:03:37,746
You have been
elected because of me.

1456
02:03:38,758 --> 02:03:42,751
Now you tell me how to
get out of these cases.

1457
02:03:43,763 --> 02:03:45,754
Tell me what
you're going to do for me.

1458
02:03:45,832 --> 02:03:47,766
l want to do a lot, Hindurao.

1459
02:03:49,769 --> 02:03:52,761
lt's difficult to
say what can be done.

1460
02:03:54,774 --> 02:03:58,767
Now if listen to my advice,
then l can tell you one thing.

1461
02:03:58,845 --> 02:04:03,782
Now you retire completely
from social life, Hindurao

1462
02:04:04,784 --> 02:04:06,775
We don't want
unnecessary problems.

1463
02:04:08,788 --> 02:04:10,779
Thanks.

1464
02:04:49,762 --> 02:04:52,754
Worker, worker.

1465
02:04:53,766 --> 02:04:55,757
What?

1466
02:04:55,835 --> 02:04:57,769
Arrange my meeting at the
place near the Zilla. What?

1467
02:04:57,937 --> 02:05:02,772
Announce it that
l'll speak myself.

1468
02:05:47,753 --> 02:05:49,744
How are you?

1469
02:06:31,731 --> 02:06:33,722
Be quiet, be quite.

1470
02:06:33,799 --> 02:06:35,733
Now the proceedings will start.

1471
02:06:36,736 --> 02:06:40,729
Your beloved leader,
Hindurao Dhonde Patil..

1472
02:06:40,806 --> 02:06:43,741
..is going to make a speech.
So all of you be quiet.

1473
02:06:45,745 --> 02:06:48,737
Friends, it's not necessary
to proclaim the good..

1474
02:06:48,814 --> 02:06:51,749
.. that Hindurao
Patil has done.

1475
02:06:52,752 --> 02:06:55,744
lt's not necessary to
call the sun as the sun.

1476
02:06:55,821 --> 02:07:00,758
lt is not necessary to
introduce an ocean as an ocean.

1477
02:07:00,826 --> 02:07:03,761
We recogniZe it immediately.

1478
02:07:03,930 --> 02:07:07,764
ln the same way, Hindurao is
the Himalaya of this place.

1479
02:07:08,768 --> 02:07:12,761
Friends, the development of
our land and Hindurao Patil.

1480
02:07:14,774 --> 02:07:17,766
These two things
cannot be separated.

1481
02:07:17,843 --> 02:07:21,779
To say anything about
the works of Hindurao Patil..

1482
02:07:22,715 --> 02:07:24,706
Now you keep quiet.
You sit down.

1483
02:07:24,784 --> 02:07:26,718
Let Hindurao speak.
Sit down.

1484
02:07:30,723 --> 02:07:32,714
Then l'm ending my speech.

1485
02:08:17,770 --> 02:08:21,763
My brothers.. and sisters.

1486
02:08:22,708 --> 02:08:25,700
Today l'm standing
in your presence..

1487
02:08:25,778 --> 02:08:28,713
ls it as a leader? No.

1488
02:08:29,715 --> 02:08:32,707
lt's not my habit to fool you
by giving you false promises..

1489
02:08:32,785 --> 02:08:34,719
..like the leaders.

1490
02:08:35,721 --> 02:08:39,714
l'm.. a person who'll do
things with his own hands.

1491
02:08:40,726 --> 02:08:42,717
Who is he, who does
things by himself?

1492
02:08:42,795 --> 02:08:44,729
He is a worker. A worker.

1493
02:08:46,732 --> 02:08:49,724
They were my efforts
to improve things here.

1494
02:08:50,736 --> 02:08:54,729
But, some bad people came
in between this good work.

1495
02:08:54,807 --> 02:08:57,742
Out of sheer prejudice

1496
02:08:57,810 --> 02:09:00,745
And friends, in order to show
you their real intentions..

1497
02:09:00,813 --> 02:09:02,747
..l had to come here.

1498
02:09:03,749 --> 02:09:06,741
Forgive me, my mothers,
sisters, brothers..

1499
02:09:06,819 --> 02:09:11,756
.. to hear this you have
to sit in the hot sun.

1500
02:09:11,824 --> 02:09:13,758
But what can we do?

1501
02:09:13,826 --> 02:09:15,760
lf a sheaf of corn is
infected by a worm..

1502
02:09:15,828 --> 02:09:17,762
..then it eats the whole crop.

1503
02:09:17,930 --> 02:09:19,761
So this worn
has to be treated.

1504
02:09:19,832 --> 02:09:21,766
lt's a very dangerous worm.

1505
02:09:23,769 --> 02:09:25,703
Just as an epidemic.

1506
02:09:26,706 --> 02:09:28,697
Brothers, you may know.

1507
02:09:28,774 --> 02:09:30,708
That this year we had locusts.

1508
02:09:30,776 --> 02:09:32,710
They had to be eradicated.

1509
02:09:32,878 --> 02:09:36,712
ln this village also,
a worm has come.

1510
02:09:36,782 --> 02:09:38,716
We have to treat it.

1511
02:09:38,784 --> 02:09:41,719
Where is that worm?

1512
02:09:42,722 --> 02:09:44,713
lt is sitting under that tree.

1513
02:09:44,790 --> 02:09:46,724
That worm is master.

1514
02:09:46,792 --> 02:09:49,727
Oh, let that be.
Talk about Maruti Kamble.

1515
02:09:50,730 --> 02:09:53,722
Hum.. l'll also talk
about Maruti Kamble.

1516
02:09:53,799 --> 02:09:55,733
But before that..

1517
02:09:56,736 --> 02:09:59,728
.. l want to tell you
about this over smart..

1518
02:09:59,805 --> 02:10:01,739
.. black worm
in white clothes.

1519
02:10:03,743 --> 02:10:07,736
This downtrodden man,
stayed here with my help.

1520
02:10:07,813 --> 02:10:09,747
l gave him a job.

1521
02:10:09,815 --> 02:10:13,751
Tell me, he made a hole in
the same plate that he ate.

1522
02:10:13,819 --> 02:10:16,754
He would have gone to jail to
break stones but l saved him.

1523
02:10:17,823 --> 02:10:19,757
l thought every man
makes a mistake.

1524
02:10:19,825 --> 02:10:22,692
And he betrayed my trust.

1525
02:10:24,697 --> 02:10:27,689
And he tried to
prevent progress here.

1526
02:10:28,701 --> 02:10:31,693
That's why he should
be taught a lesson..

1527
02:10:32,705 --> 02:10:34,696
.. he should be tried.

1528
02:10:34,774 --> 02:10:36,708
His face should be blackened.

1529
02:10:36,776 --> 02:10:38,710
He should be paraded
around on a donkey.

1530
02:10:39,712 --> 02:10:44,706
Brothers, and so we should
drive him out of this area.

1531
02:10:46,719 --> 02:10:49,711
So brothers, the time
has come to decide..

1532
02:10:49,789 --> 02:10:52,724
.. whether we want the
progress of this area or..

1533
02:10:52,792 --> 02:10:55,727
.. whether we want the
destruction of this area.

1534
02:10:55,795 --> 02:10:57,729
So the main point is that..

1535
02:10:57,797 --> 02:11:00,732
..under the influence of this
ungrateful man's tactics..

1536
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:02,734
..are we going to make this
village into a living hell..

1537
02:11:02,802 --> 02:11:05,737
.. or are we going
to make it heaven..

1538
02:11:05,805 --> 02:11:07,739
.. by driving this man away?

1539
02:11:09,742 --> 02:11:12,734
Oh! What happened
about Maruti Kamble?

1540
02:11:12,812 --> 02:11:15,747
What about Maruti Kamble?
What're you saying?

1541
02:11:39,772 --> 02:11:41,763
He disappeared in the night?

1542
02:11:41,841 --> 02:11:44,776
Yes sir. We still don't
know where he went.

1543
02:11:44,844 --> 02:11:46,778
Keep the enquiry on.

1544
02:11:46,846 --> 02:11:48,780
When matters came
to a head he got scared.

1545
02:11:48,848 --> 02:11:50,782
The enquiry is on.

1546
02:11:50,850 --> 02:11:52,784
But now it is
difficult for Hindurao.

1547
02:11:53,452 --> 02:11:54,783
Master.. master..
congrats. Congrats.

1548
02:11:54,854 --> 02:11:56,788
Wake up master, wake up.

1549
02:11:56,856 --> 02:11:58,790
Hindurao absconded
from the village. Yes.

1550
02:11:58,858 --> 02:12:00,792
You have Master,
where are you?

1551
02:12:00,860 --> 02:12:02,794
Wake up, Master, wake up.

1552
02:12:05,798 --> 02:12:08,790
What happened? What, what
happened? Hindurao ran away.

1553
02:12:08,868 --> 02:12:11,803
There is commotion
in his house.

1554
02:12:11,871 --> 02:12:14,806
There is a big
strike in the factory.

1555
02:12:14,874 --> 02:12:16,808
The factory is closed.

1556
02:12:16,876 --> 02:12:18,810
A big quarrel has erupted
between the poultry management.

1557
02:12:18,878 --> 02:12:22,746
Hindurao's empire has
collapsed, Master, yes.

1558
02:12:23,749 --> 02:12:25,740
And you know what?

1559
02:12:25,818 --> 02:12:28,753
Nothing could be
retained by anybody.. yes.

1560
02:12:29,755 --> 02:12:32,747
Finished.. that Hindurao's
reign is finished.

1561
02:12:33,759 --> 02:12:35,750
But Master, you harassed
him to the limits..

1562
02:12:35,828 --> 02:12:37,762
.. regarding that
Kamble's case.

1563
02:12:38,764 --> 02:12:40,755
l'm going now.

1564
02:12:40,833 --> 02:12:42,767
We have a meeting of all
the shareholders.. yes.

1565
02:12:43,769 --> 02:12:45,760
And Master, today
the meeting will shine.

1566
02:12:45,838 --> 02:12:47,772
Our party will be on the rise.

1567
02:12:47,840 --> 02:12:49,774
And then what?

1568
02:12:49,842 --> 02:12:51,776
l'll be the chairman.

1569
02:12:52,778 --> 02:12:55,770
l came here specially
to congratulate you.

1570
02:12:55,848 --> 02:12:57,782
Ok master, l'm going.

1571
02:12:58,784 --> 02:13:00,775
Finished.. that Hindurao's
reign is finished.

1572
02:13:00,853 --> 02:13:03,788
And Master, today
the meeting will shine.

1573
02:13:03,856 --> 02:13:05,790
Our party will be on the rise.

1574
02:13:05,858 --> 02:13:08,793
And then what?
l'll be the chairman.

1575
02:13:40,759 --> 02:13:42,750
Hindurao..

1576
02:13:46,765 --> 02:13:48,756
Hindurao..

1577
02:13:48,834 --> 02:13:50,768
Hindurao is gone to the dogs.

1578
02:13:50,836 --> 02:13:52,770
Why are you knocking?

1579
02:13:52,838 --> 02:13:54,772
Go now.

1580
02:14:20,799 --> 02:14:23,734
What Master, have you
broken your fast, or what?

1581
02:14:23,802 --> 02:14:25,736
But atlast you won!

1582
02:15:38,744 --> 02:15:41,736
Why did you come here?

1583
02:15:41,814 --> 02:15:44,749
You came.. so l came, boss.

1584
02:15:44,817 --> 02:15:46,751
You'll die unnecessarily.

1585
02:15:47,920 --> 02:15:50,753
Times like that have
come and gone, boss.

1586
02:15:51,757 --> 02:15:54,749
lf it comes now
then it has to happen.

1587
02:15:54,827 --> 02:15:57,762
Master, don't act
too smart, You'll die.

1588
02:15:58,764 --> 02:16:00,755
Yes one more murder will be
credited to your account.

1589
02:16:00,833 --> 02:16:03,768
What else can happen?

1590
02:16:04,770 --> 02:16:06,761
Who'll cry if l die boss?

1591
02:16:07,773 --> 02:16:09,764
l'm not Maruti Kamble.

1592
02:16:12,778 --> 02:16:15,770
You've betrayed me, Master,

1593
02:16:15,848 --> 02:16:18,783
You didn't keep your word.

1594
02:16:23,722 --> 02:16:26,714
l've kept each and every
word that l gave you, boss.

1595
02:16:26,792 --> 02:16:31,729
No. you had said, you won't tell
tell anyone about Maruti Kamble.

1596
02:16:33,732 --> 02:16:36,724
Your memory is
betraying you boss.

1597
02:16:36,802 --> 02:16:40,738
l had only given you my
word for leaving your place..

1598
02:16:40,806 --> 02:16:42,740
.. and l've kept that.

1599
02:16:42,808 --> 02:16:46,744
Master, l told you the
truth about the murder..

1600
02:16:46,812 --> 02:16:49,747
..only because you
gave me your promise.

1601
02:16:49,815 --> 02:16:51,749
l've kept that promise, boss.

1602
02:16:51,817 --> 02:16:54,752
l left your area immediately.

1603
02:16:55,754 --> 02:17:00,748
Master, you
betrayed our friendship.

1604
02:17:00,826 --> 02:17:02,760
Ungrateful.

1605
02:17:08,767 --> 02:17:11,759
Ungrateful is not the
abuse of friendship, boss.

1606
02:17:11,837 --> 02:17:13,771
lt is the abuse for a favor.

1607
02:17:15,774 --> 02:17:20,768
Go, or else l'll empty all
the bullets in your head.

1608
02:17:21,780 --> 02:17:25,716
Do it boss, finish me off.

1609
02:17:26,718 --> 02:17:28,709
Or else you won't escape, boss.

1610
02:17:34,726 --> 02:17:37,718
What will you do?
What will you do?

1611
02:17:37,796 --> 02:17:39,730
What will l do?

1612
02:17:44,736 --> 02:17:47,728
You don't know about
this Master, boss.

1613
02:17:49,741 --> 02:17:53,734
lf l remained alive
then l'll take you back.

1614
02:17:53,812 --> 02:17:55,746
Back?

1615
02:17:55,814 --> 02:17:57,748
Yes back.

1616
02:17:59,751 --> 02:18:01,742
ln your kingdom.

1617
02:18:02,754 --> 02:18:06,747
For that reason itself l've come
till here looking for you, boss.

1618
02:18:06,825 --> 02:18:09,760
Why? To hang me?

1619
02:18:10,929 --> 02:18:13,762
Go on, go on, l'll not go.

1620
02:18:13,832 --> 02:18:17,768
Boss, as it is in this
condition you're suffering.

1621
02:18:18,770 --> 02:18:21,762
By locking the doors.
By hiding like a coward.

1622
02:18:22,708 --> 02:18:25,700
Listen to me boss, c'mon.

1623
02:18:25,777 --> 02:18:27,711
You're an agent of the police.

1624
02:18:27,879 --> 02:18:31,713
No boss, if at all,
l am your agent.

1625
02:18:31,783 --> 02:18:33,717
Boss, are you going to
run away from whatever good..

1626
02:18:33,785 --> 02:18:35,719
.. you yourself had created?

1627
02:18:36,722 --> 02:18:39,714
After you everything
is in a mess, boss.

1628
02:18:39,791 --> 02:18:41,725
All arrangements
are in turmoil.

1629
02:18:42,728 --> 02:18:45,720
No boss. You cannot
run away from your roots.

1630
02:18:46,732 --> 02:18:49,724
Where can you run
from your shadow, boss?

1631
02:18:49,801 --> 02:18:52,736
You place is there.
ln that kingdom of yours.

1632
02:18:54,740 --> 02:18:56,731
C'mon boss. Let's return.

1633
02:18:56,808 --> 02:18:58,742
No, l will not come.

1634
02:18:59,911 --> 02:19:01,742
You will come, boss.

1635
02:19:01,813 --> 02:19:03,747
No, no, l will not come.

1636
02:19:04,750 --> 02:19:07,742
And l will not go without you.

1637
02:19:20,766 --> 02:19:22,700
Then die.

1638
02:19:36,715 --> 02:19:38,706
No boss, death
is pleased with me.

1639
02:19:38,784 --> 02:19:40,718
lt will not come.

1640
02:19:41,887 --> 02:19:44,720
Most probably
l'll be immortal.

1641
02:19:45,724 --> 02:19:49,717
Boss, you did not
take the chance l gave you.

1642
02:19:49,795 --> 02:19:51,729
Now it's my turn.

1643
02:19:52,731 --> 02:19:54,722
C'mon, boss.

1644
02:19:54,800 --> 02:19:57,735
The kingdom that has become a
stranger to you is calling you.

1645
02:20:22,694 --> 02:20:24,685
Boss, the time had come.

1646
02:20:24,763 --> 02:20:26,697
But the moment has not.

1647
02:20:29,701 --> 02:20:32,693
We don't choose
our death, boss.

1648
02:20:32,771 --> 02:20:34,705
We can choose to live.

1649
02:20:34,773 --> 02:20:36,707
And that too for some time.

1650
02:20:38,710 --> 02:20:40,701
Boss, choose.

1651
02:20:40,779 --> 02:20:42,713
You want to live in fear..

1652
02:20:42,781 --> 02:20:46,717
..or, to face the
consequences like a true man.

1653
02:20:46,785 --> 02:20:48,719
What do you want?

1654
02:20:51,723 --> 02:20:54,715
Boss, l'm telling you
from personal experience.

1655
02:20:54,793 --> 02:20:57,728
Wine is not the
solution to any problem.

1656
02:20:58,730 --> 02:21:00,721
Answer me.

1657
02:21:00,799 --> 02:21:02,733
Answer yourself.

1658
02:21:02,801 --> 02:21:04,735
Which way will you choose?

1659
02:21:17,749 --> 02:21:22,743
Why should somebody
enter into the tent..

1660
02:21:23,755 --> 02:21:26,747
..somebody shed his blood..

1661
02:21:27,826 --> 02:21:29,760
.. for someone else.

1662
02:21:30,762 --> 02:21:35,756
Why should somebody
enter into the tent..

1663
02:21:36,768 --> 02:21:38,759
..somebody shed his blood..

1664
02:21:38,837 --> 02:21:41,772
.. for someone else.

1665
02:21:42,774 --> 02:21:48,770
Who comes willingly
in this world..

1666
02:21:49,781 --> 02:21:54,775
.. all these fresh
flowers are burning..

1667
02:21:55,787 --> 02:21:59,780
On somebody's shoulders..

1668
02:21:59,858 --> 02:22:03,794
.. there is somebody's burden.
