(Background music)

5
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:54,270
Man we shouldn’t have left
Veer in that condition.

6
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,910
Yes, if something happened to her?

7
00:03:57,076 --> 00:04:01,468
You didn’t saw there was police?
We could have gotten into trouble.

8
00:04:02,085 --> 00:04:03,933
Oh god! You are getting
tensed for no reason.

9
00:04:04,013 --> 00:04:05,232
Let’s complete what we have come do first.

10
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:05,945
Move on.

11
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,720

(Sighs)

30
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:14,443

"Rains, Clouds, all These arms are empty."

34
00:09:08,991 --> 00:09:20,747

weather is restless."

"My nights are waiting for you."

37
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:29,720
"Sunshine's spreading on wet lands
Sun rises up and night fades way."

38
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:36,594
"How much more should I wait for you?"

39
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:47,158
"White fuzz touched me away,
Your memory filled in my dreams."

40
00:10:47,387 --> 00:10:53,440
"This love of your doesn’t let me live."

41
00:10:53,520 --> 00:11:03,289
"My hopes are waiting for you,."

42
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:12,253
"My arms are waiting for you."

43
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:22,073

00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:15,093
OPERATOR: The subscriber you are trying to

(Car engine start sound)

54
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:31,274
Can I see Vikram?

55
00:12:31,537 --> 00:12:33,177
Madam, He has not come to
office since yesterday.

56
00:12:33,218 --> 00:12:35,312
Okay, can I see Areena.

57
00:12:35,391 --> 00:12:37,688
She was also seen with
Vikram sir last time.

58
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:38,960
Oh god!

59
00:12:51,285 --> 00:12:53,141
Where is bobby? I can't reach him.

00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:55,819
He hasn't came to office since 24 hours.

61
00:12:55,915 --> 00:12:59,329
I am also trying but
he is not picking up.

64
00:14:09,909 --> 00:14:11,202
Finally found the shore!

65
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:14,690
But what is this place?

66
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:19,317
- Where are we?
- I don't know!

67
00:14:19,404 --> 00:14:23,332
- Let's check out.
- Oh god! This place is totally deserted.

68
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:24,534
Let's move guys.

69
00:14:28,907 --> 00:14:31,449
- What Island is this?
- There is no one here!

70
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,660
Relax guys.

71
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,098
- Where are we?
- Don't know man.

72
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:42,507
- What kind of Deserted place is this?
- Listen, what's there.

73
00:14:42,587 --> 00:14:43,299
Where?

74
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:52,644
- Let's move guys. Come on.
- Come on. Maybe we can find something.

75
00:15:00,627 --> 00:15:03,361
(Waves sound)

76
00:15:20,385 --> 00:15:21,828
What are you doing? Are you mad?

77
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,943
I am already scared and you are
scaring the hell out of me.

78
00:15:25,103 --> 00:15:26,272
- You're okay?
- Idiot!

79
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,555

82
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:37,295
- Guys.
- Yaa?

83
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:40,242
let's do one thing. Let's move
in four different directions.

84
00:15:40,283 --> 00:15:41,136
Yes.

85
00:15:41,177 --> 00:15:42,933
No! I am not going anywhere alone.

86
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:47,590
Try to understand, I we all go in different
directions then may be one will find a way

87
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:48,933
- otherwise we will be stuck here.
- Off course.

88
00:15:48,974 --> 00:15:50,742
- There is no other option man.
- She is right.

89
00:15:51,135 --> 00:15:52,822
- Seriously.
- Let's go, let's go, go, go go.

90
00:15:52,863 --> 00:15:53,486
Let's go.

91
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,763
Let's go.

92

96
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,809
Janasheen!

97
00:16:39,504 --> 00:16:42,434
Janasheen!

98
00:16:43,138 --> 00:16:44,336
Janasheen!

99
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,316
Janasheen!

100
00:16:46,357 --> 00:16:49,161
- Vikram.
- Where is he?

101
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:56,817
Janasheen, where are you?

102
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,622
What the hell!

103
00:16:59,663 --> 00:17:01,052
Janasheen!

104
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:04,637
Janasheen!

105
00:17:13,473 --> 00:17:15,343
Where are they gone?

106
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:32,944
What is going on here.

107
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,027
Where is Janasheen?

108
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:53,267
(Temple bell)

109
00:17:54,378 --> 00:17:55,244
God.

110
00:17:58,151 --> 00:17:58,968
Veer is missing.

111
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,134
Where did he went alone?

112
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:08,170
I mean, It’s not possible. He loves me!

113
00:18:12,114 --> 00:18:17,653
My heart says something and
my brain says something else.

114
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:19,744
(Sighs)

115
00:18:19,786 --> 00:18:22,512
God, plase do something.

116
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,306
(Panting)

117
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:02,341
Hey Raunak, How are you?

118
00:19:04,716 --> 00:19:05,997
Is all okay Raunak?

119
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,482
No sister. Nothing is okay.

120
00:19:11,732 --> 00:19:13,411
What happened, Raunak?

121
00:19:18,135 --> 00:19:19,752
Veer is missing form two days.

122
00:19:21,011 --> 00:19:24,144
I am trying to find him like crazy.

123
00:19:25,284 --> 00:19:26,448
You talk to him.

124
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,472
Hello! What happened Raunak?

125
00:19:29,698 --> 00:19:32,183
Brother-in-law, Veer is missing.

126
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:33,362
Veer is missing?

127
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,417
This is so childish.

128
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:37,050
Jeejo, I want Veer.

129
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,417
I can't live without him.

130
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,042
You don't cry ok? I'll do something.

131
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:45,659
Brother-in-law, Please!

132
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:52,010
What will we do now? We are in U.S.A.

133
00:19:52,174 --> 00:19:54,197
What else, let's go to India.

134
00:19:54,682 --> 00:19:57,690
That is fine but practically it would
take us two days to reach India

135
00:19:57,711 --> 00:19:59,307
and Raunak is there alone and tensed.

136
00:19:59,346 --> 00:20:01,586
Okay wait, I'll find a way.

137
00:20:02,198 --> 00:20:03,010
A way?

138
00:20:03,174 --> 00:20:04,323
Wait a sec dear.

139
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:10,963
Hello,

140
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:11,815
(Indistinct chattering)

141
00:20:11,838 --> 00:20:12,870
Namaste,

142
00:20:19,571 --> 00:20:21,126
Those paintings will speak,

143
00:20:21,737 --> 00:20:23,565
if your trust me.

144
00:20:24,706 --> 00:20:26,878
How do you know about those paintings?

145
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:29,729
Because I can sense those things,

146
00:20:31,128 --> 00:20:32,800
which you can't.

147
00:20:33,042 --> 00:20:35,902
- I am seeing things...
- Which you are not supposed to see.

148
00:20:36,408 --> 00:20:37,518
I know it all.

149
00:20:37,706 --> 00:20:38,691
How do you know?

150
00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:42,604
I know stuff which other people don't.

151
00:20:43,526 --> 00:20:45,073
You show me that painting's place.

152
00:20:46,365 --> 00:20:47,248
Hmm.

153
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:55,631
Come in!

154
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:06,784
(Background music)

155
00:21:09,717 --> 00:21:11,006
This way madam.

156
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:20,712
(Background music)

157
00:21:28,364 --> 00:21:31,995
These are the paintings right?

158
00:21:32,072 --> 00:21:32,650
Yes,

159
00:21:34,212 --> 00:21:35,900
but those people,

160
00:21:36,408 --> 00:21:38,095
are in the woods!

161
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:43,165
-Do you live in this house?

162
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:45,626
No, I live somewhere else.

163
00:21:46,923 --> 00:21:49,189
Everything happening is connected to you.

164
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,236
And you don't live here.

165
00:21:54,072 --> 00:21:55,486
Take me to your home.

166
00:22:04,286 --> 00:22:07,216
(Panting)

167
00:22:12,334 --> 00:22:17,756
(Background music)

168
00:22:23,506 --> 00:22:25,194
Areena!

169
00:22:33,087 --> 00:22:33,805
Bobby!

170
00:22:33,844 --> 00:22:34,727
Bobby!

171
00:22:38,977 --> 00:22:39,627
Bobby!

172
00:22:39,813 --> 00:22:40,463
Bobby!

173
00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:41,743
- Bobby!
- My leg!

174
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,002
(Grunts) Bobby!

175
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:49,119
- Bobby are you okay?
- Are you okay?

176
00:22:49,525 --> 00:22:52,142
I can't run anymore.

177
00:22:52,431 --> 00:22:53,689
Get out of here,

178
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,667
otherwise this forest would eat us.

179
00:22:56,947 --> 00:23:00,213
But, where should we go?

180
00:23:01,158 --> 00:23:04,355
We don't even know where we are going.

181
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:08,465
(Animal Roaring)

182
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:14,528
This voice, It sounds familiar.

183
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:18,646
I think it's a Tiger.

184
00:23:18,825 --> 00:23:20,060
It's not Tiger,

185
00:23:21,974 --> 00:23:23,278
It's Lion.

186
00:23:23,317 --> 00:23:27,043

(Panting)

188
00:23:30,037 --> 00:23:31,638
Hurry up!

189
00:23:33,052 --> 00:23:35,036
Areena, Come on!

190
00:23:51,435 --> 00:23:53,797
Look, Mango! I am hungry.

191
00:23:53,935 --> 00:23:54,622
Let's eat?

192
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:55,505
Okay, eat.

193
00:23:57,974 --> 00:23:58,857
Take this.

194
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,240
Take it.

195
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,326
You too take it.

Come on, run, run!

199
00:24:59,263 --> 00:25:01,372
Ghost, Ghost!

200
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:07,333
(Background music)

201
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:18,791
This... this... whose bungalow is this
in the middle of the woods?

202
00:25:19,606 --> 00:25:22,785
Whoever's be it, we just want help.

203
00:25:24,505 --> 00:25:25,855
Let's go inside, come on!

204
00:25:42,747 --> 00:25:45,872
This place is so weird and scary.

205
00:25:46,115 --> 00:25:47,482
Where have we come?

206
00:25:55,305 --> 00:26:07,724
(Background music)

207
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:23,878
(Background music)

208
00:27:10,425 --> 00:27:12,284
Areena, what is this?

209
00:27:18,821 --> 00:27:19,806
Areena?

210
00:27:23,212 --> 00:27:24,696
Vikram!

211
00:27:31,118 --> 00:27:32,095
Veer!

212
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:34,423
What?

213
00:27:34,626 --> 00:27:35,563
Veer!

214
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,157
Veer!

215
00:27:45,478 --> 00:27:46,931
What?

216
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,104
- Areena, What's wrong with you baby?
- No!

217
00:27:58,314 --> 00:28:00,765
- He is coming closer to me!
- Man, who is here?

218
00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:02,993
- Who?
- There's no one, Areena!

219
00:28:11,008 --> 00:28:12,220
Where are you going?

220
00:28:13,047 --> 00:28:14,055
Areena!

221
00:28:17,101 --> 00:28:18,464
- Areena!
- Areena!

222
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,658
- No Vikram!
- Areena!

223
00:28:35,072 --> 00:28:37,197
Areenaaaa!

224
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,447
Areenaaaa!

225
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:01,887
Let's go vikram, let's go.

226
00:29:02,314 --> 00:29:04,988
- Areena.
- Let's go vikram, let's go.

227
00:29:05,188 --> 00:29:06,610
Areena is gone.

228
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,369
She is gone.

229
00:29:09,376 --> 00:29:11,001
We also have to get out of here.

230
00:29:12,455 --> 00:29:13,392
Why don't you understand?

231
00:29:14,541 --> 00:29:15,486
Please understand,

232
00:29:16,353 --> 00:29:17,048
Okay?

233
00:29:20,822 --> 00:29:23,345
Vikram, Listen!

234
00:29:25,142 --> 00:29:27,470
Car! Let's go, come.

235
00:29:27,556 --> 00:29:28,580
(Birds Chirping)

236
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:30,072
Come!

237
00:29:32,581 --> 00:29:36,331
(Wind blowing)

238
00:29:45,948 --> 00:29:49,346
I can't see anything in your house.

239
00:29:51,346 --> 00:29:54,096
The way I can't see things clear here,

240
00:29:55,191 --> 00:29:58,706
Same way I can't see you clear.

241
00:29:58,954 --> 00:30:00,168
I don't understand!

242
00:30:03,423 --> 00:30:06,626
What is your connection
with that bungalow?

243
00:30:33,025 --> 00:30:34,329
Hey prince how are you?

244
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:37,602
I am good, fit and fine. How are you?

245
00:30:37,822 --> 00:30:39,604
Man I am just tensed a bit.

246
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:41,580
Hey, why? What happened?

247
00:30:41,689 --> 00:30:44,220
I couldn’t figure out the
eyes of my dream girl.

248
00:30:44,572 --> 00:30:45,994
Man you really scared me.

249
00:30:46,642 --> 00:30:50,195
You usually make a painting in four
hours, you spent four days for this one?

250
00:30:51,313 --> 00:30:54,849
The eyes of my dream girl should be like
that, that I should get lost in those.

251
00:30:55,126 --> 00:30:58,142
Just like I am lost in the
eyes of my dream girl.

252
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:00,925
Hey Veer, See you then, I am busy. Bye!

253
00:31:01,191 --> 00:31:03,254
Okay then see you, Bye, thanks.

257
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,863
Excuse me!

258
00:32:54,664 --> 00:32:59,539
(Background music)

259
00:33:27,511 --> 00:33:29,207
- Bye!
- Buh-bye!

260
00:33:29,496 --> 00:33:31,525
Are you following me?

261
00:33:31,925 --> 00:33:34,191
You are mistaken, I am a painter.

262
00:33:34,386 --> 00:33:37,871
And I want to showcase my
paintings in your art gallery.

263
00:33:38,472 --> 00:33:40,409
Everyone say this to me.

264
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:43,842
We only showcase
exclusive paintings here.

265
00:33:44,042 --> 00:33:47,992
But I am good painter, I want to
show you a glimpse of my painting.

266
00:33:49,245 --> 00:33:50,136
Okay.

267
00:33:50,448 --> 00:33:52,253
Look at this.

268
00:33:53,956 --> 00:33:55,565
This is my painting.

269
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:57,569
You made it?

270
00:33:57,956 --> 00:34:01,269
Completed it last night,
with my imagination.

271
00:34:03,104 --> 00:34:05,815
Can you show me my painting?

272
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,838
How can I not show you your paintings?

273
00:34:10,823 --> 00:34:14,745
(Background music)

274
00:34:14,818 --> 00:34:17,967
- Where are taking me?
- There is a surprise for you.

275
00:34:18,506 --> 00:34:19,318
Okay.

277
00:34:29,459 --> 00:34:35,803
"I haven't came out of your thoughts."

278
00:34:36,272 --> 00:34:38,967
How did you made my painting
without seeing me?

279
00:34:39,545 --> 00:34:41,014
It looks so real.

280
00:34:41,451 --> 00:34:43,123
The one who I used to see in my dreams.

281
00:34:43,811 --> 00:34:45,209
I've made the painting of her.

282
00:34:45,342 --> 00:34:50,694
"I haven't came out of your thoughts."

283
00:34:52,045 --> 00:34:57,476
"I have lost my thoughts in you."

284
00:34:58,331 --> 00:35:08,381
"I feel like touching
your lips all the time."

285
00:35:09,533 --> 00:35:18,072
"My heart feels safe in your arms."

286

(Background music)

290
00:35:54,932 --> 00:36:03,297
"I was a lost passenger in your streets."

291
00:36:12,728 --> 00:36:21,282
"I was a lost passenger in your streets."

292
00:36:22,033 --> 00:36:30,678
"I was an infidel before meeting you."

293
00:36:31,635 --> 00:36:39,854
"My step turns towards you."

294
00:36:40,191 --> 00:36:44,370
"Strays around."

295
00:36:44,691 --> 00:36:53,294
"My heart feels safe in your arms."

296
00:36:53,503 --> 00:37:02,280
"My heart feels safe in your arms."

297
00:37:02,488 --> 00:37:06,995
"Safe in your arms."

298
00:37:07,357 --> 00:37:10,873
"Safe in your arms."

299

(Background music)

300
00:37:30,013 --> 00:37:38,281
"I was lonely inside my
house every evening."

301
00:37:48,138 --> 00:37:56,720
"I was lonely inside my
house every evening."

302
00:37:56,888 --> 00:38:05,755
"Used to pass time with stray colours."

303
00:38:06,552 --> 00:38:10,537
"Then you came along."

304
00:38:11,068 --> 00:38:14,927
"I am addicted to you."

305
00:38:15,162 --> 00:38:19,279
"My heart says it all."

306
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:28,307
"My heart feels safe in your arms."

307
00:38:28,654 --> 00:38:37,416
"My heart feels safe in your arms."

308
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:42,112
"Safe in your arms."

309
00:38:42,213 --> 00:38:46,557
"Safe in your arms."

310
00:38:52,752 --> 00:38:55,440
How do you make such beautiful paintings?

311
00:38:55,854 --> 00:38:57,252
I am a passionate painter.

312
00:38:57,659 --> 00:39:01,268
I pain what my heart likes.

313
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:03,284
Ohh really?

314
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:06,838
And, what does your heart say now?

315
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:11,901
(Background music)

316
00:39:59,387 --> 00:40:00,918
Do you love me so much?

317
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:08,934
Tell me you will never leave me.

318
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,082
Never,

319
00:40:10,817 --> 00:40:11,754
I promise,

320
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:14,371
I will never leave you.

321
00:40:23,371 --> 00:40:25,292
Sister, what are you doing?

322
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:26,481
Hmm.

323
00:40:27,629 --> 00:40:30,012
- Preparation for your birthday, what else.
- Sister...

324
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:34,129
you are preparing like it is not
birthday, It is a marriage.

325
00:40:34,629 --> 00:40:36,543
You are talking too much about
marriage these days.

326
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,375
Umm, well.

327
00:40:39,957 --> 00:40:40,980
I think I am in love.

328
00:40:42,168 --> 00:40:45,222
I knew it, knew it, knew it.

329
00:40:45,387 --> 00:40:46,356
Come here, sit.

330
00:40:46,739 --> 00:40:48,406
I want all the juicy news.

331
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:49,106
Patience.

332
00:40:50,145 --> 00:40:51,086
His name is Veer.

333
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,262
Tell me what does he do?

334
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:54,465
Is he handsome?

335
00:40:54,801 --> 00:40:56,848
- Where does his family lives?
- Quiet!

336
00:40:57,637 --> 00:40:58,496
He is a painter.

337
00:40:58,824 --> 00:40:59,778
When can we see him?

338
00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:01,332
What has happed to you?

339
00:41:01,832 --> 00:41:03,067
I want to know.

340
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:05,948
Listen, I've already invited
him to the party,

341
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:07,739
and he's going to come.

342
00:41:08,153 --> 00:41:09,207
Good going.

343
00:41:10,834 --> 00:41:12,084
Meet him with your brother-in-law.

344
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:13,576
Okay, done.

345
00:41:14,483 --> 00:41:16,506
- One hundred percent.
- Aww,

346
00:41:17,584 --> 00:41:19,056
my baby.

347
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,662
- Listen, don’t embarrass me tomorrow.
- Okay, my dear.

348
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,881
Decorations are very pretty.

349
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,732
- Thank you. -You know sis, this
will be my best birthday.

350
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,271
- You are looking so fat.
- What?

351
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:35,343
I am joking.

352
00:41:35,897 --> 00:41:37,712
- Don’t start today.
- Where is Veer?

353
00:41:38,389 --> 00:41:40,692
- I don’t know.
- Where is our person of the day?

354
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:44,795
Person of the day is just here.

355
00:41:45,756 --> 00:41:48,413
Oh she is here right. But where

356
00:41:48,529 --> 00:41:51,514
Hey, now you two don't start,
don’t embarrass me.

357
00:41:57,662 --> 00:42:00,108
Look, here is our guest of honour.

Oh!

Hey, we always give surprises Raunak.

362
00:42:14,631 --> 00:42:15,584

00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:39,958
It is getting late Raunak.

374
00:42:40,409 --> 00:42:41,082
Where is he?

375
00:42:41,231 --> 00:42:43,551

00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:48,402
Ya? Ya sure, thank you, thank you.

00:42:51,824 --> 00:42:53,367
Babe, we need to get out of here.

379
00:42:53,692 --> 00:42:55,168

380
00:42:55,317 --> 00:42:56,582

397
00:44:17,081 --> 00:44:21,308
(Background music)

398
00:44:26,713 --> 00:44:35,289
"I am excited, when you touch my body."

399
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:50,877
"I am excited, when you touch my body."

400
00:44:51,541 --> 00:44:55,627
"These moments should stop."

401
00:44:56,236 --> 00:45:00,072
"Take me in your arms."

402
00:45:09,033 --> 00:45:17,539
"My heart feels safe in your arms."

403
00:45:18,025 --> 00:45:26,959
"My heart feels safe in your arms."

404
00:45:31,674 --> 00:45:35,525
"Safe in your arms."

405
00:45:36,384 --> 00:45:40,626
"Safe in your arms."

406
00:45:41,025 --> 00:45:45,931
"Safe in your arms."

407
00:46:10,195 --> 00:46:18,442
"My heart feels safe in your arms."

408
00:46:19,254 --> 00:46:27,588
"My heart feels safe in your arms."

409
00:46:28,261 --> 00:46:32,590
"Safe in your arms."

410
00:46:35,426 --> 00:46:37,019
So Garret, as I was saying.

411
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,869
We deal with paintings and...

412
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,191
And this,

413
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:41,769
this beautiful girl over here.

414
00:46:42,246 --> 00:46:45,998
Is my business partner and
also my girlfriend, Areena.

415
00:46:46,355 --> 00:46:48,051
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

416
00:46:48,269 --> 00:46:49,316
And if I may say,

417
00:46:50,222 --> 00:46:53,199
- You have a very beautiful daughter.
- Excuse me young man.

418
00:46:53,308 --> 00:46:54,097
Excused.

419
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:57,566
- She is not my daughter.
- She is my girlfriend, Angelina.

420
00:47:02,574 --> 00:47:05,426
Now, can we actually get down
to some business please?

421
00:47:05,863 --> 00:47:06,959
Yes sure.

422
00:47:08,027 --> 00:47:11,613
Actually, she will be twenty-one next week.

423
00:47:11,965 --> 00:47:13,191
Oh, Happy Birthday.

424
00:47:13,543 --> 00:47:15,097
And she loves to paint.

425
00:47:15,426 --> 00:47:17,691
So I would like to give her
something very special.

426
00:47:18,144 --> 00:47:19,629
Okay. So,

427
00:47:19,996 --> 00:47:21,488
Garret, so what is the budget?

428
00:47:21,988 --> 00:47:24,855
Umm, not much. A million dollars.

429
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:28,644
- What did this old man say?
- A million dollars.

430
00:47:29,441 --> 00:47:32,199
Vikram, close to six crores
and seventy-seven thousand.

431
00:47:32,699 --> 00:47:33,738
Impress him.

432
00:47:37,793 --> 00:47:39,707
Vikram, please.

433
00:47:40,183 --> 00:47:45,882
So what I am asking with you,
can you tell me the budget again?

434
00:47:46,074 --> 00:47:48,551
A million dollars, and I
need it within a week.

435
00:47:49,043 --> 00:47:50,629
Areena he needs it within a week.

436
00:47:50,717 --> 00:47:51,785
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.

437
00:47:55,106 --> 00:47:56,831
HI, Bobby listen.

438
00:47:56,919 --> 00:47:58,919
- Yes, say.
- Got a very rich client.

439
00:47:59,098 --> 00:48:02,166
- We will have meet Raunak tomorrow.
- Fantastic, done.

440
00:48:02,207 --> 00:48:02,919
Done.

441
00:48:03,919 --> 00:48:04,536
Hi.

442
00:48:05,544 --> 00:48:06,184
Hi.

443
00:48:06,356 --> 00:48:10,067
What is the matter? Long time,
there's been no business from your side.

444
00:48:10,261 --> 00:48:13,792
Looks like you are not interested
to to work with us anymore.

445
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:17,675
It is nothing like that, you
guys are my permanent clients.

446
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:22,089
Raunak, you know what,
our market is totally down.

447
00:48:22,479 --> 00:48:26,257
And we also haven’t got any
new paintings to market.

448
00:48:27,089 --> 00:48:28,893
There is a painter I know.

449
00:48:29,252 --> 00:48:30,612
That's what we want.

450
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:32,190
Who is he?

451
00:48:33,136 --> 00:48:35,358
Veer Singh Rajput.

452
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:36,631
Who is he?

453
00:48:36,889 --> 00:48:39,172
You know Raunak, we only work with brands.

454
00:48:39,819 --> 00:48:41,953
What are you doing Vikram?

455
00:48:42,615 --> 00:48:46,749
Bobby, there is nothing
over Internet about Veer.

456
00:48:47,248 --> 00:48:48,373
Guys that's my job.

457
00:48:48,998 --> 00:48:50,670
For once, at least see his work.

458
00:48:51,014 --> 00:48:51,983
He is a class apart.

459
00:48:53,155 --> 00:48:53,803
Raunak,

460
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:57,584
Raunak, I think we will end
up just wasting our time.

461
00:48:58,444 --> 00:49:01,022
I have never wasted your time.

462
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:03,264
Okay, let's give it a try.

463
00:49:03,611 --> 00:49:04,878
Okay, that's more like it.

464
00:49:05,584 --> 00:49:08,542
I want that your get famous.

465
00:49:09,037 --> 00:49:11,373
People should know you as a great painter.

466
00:49:12,225 --> 00:49:13,608
But why is it required?

467
00:49:13,803 --> 00:49:16,256
It is not my business.
This is my passion.

468
00:49:16,881 --> 00:49:19,787
God gave you a great talent.

469
00:49:21,514 --> 00:49:23,728
Listen Veer, you are an artist.

470
00:49:24,373 --> 00:49:30,005
Show it to people than locking
it up in a room.

471
00:49:30,983 --> 00:49:32,592
But I never gave it a thought.

472
00:49:32,725 --> 00:49:35,624
I do, and are we apart?

473
00:49:37,405 --> 00:49:38,444
How is it possible?

474
00:49:39,483 --> 00:49:41,209
Anything is possible my love.

475
00:49:41,748 --> 00:49:46,572
I will introduce to a top agent who
can make your paintings world famous.

476
00:49:47,678 --> 00:49:48,662
Now don’t say no.

477
00:49:49,476 --> 00:49:50,269
Okay.

478
00:49:51,272 --> 00:49:53,303
- I love you.
- Love you too.

479
00:49:58,873 --> 00:50:02,631
(Cheering)

480
00:50:13,858 --> 00:50:14,975
Veer, please.

481
00:50:17,241 --> 00:50:19,709
Wow, hmm.

482
00:50:25,091 --> 00:50:28,060
Paintings are really awesome.

483
00:50:28,615 --> 00:50:30,709
When will you show us the paintings?
Let's go on.

484
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:34,319
You people crack the
deal first, after that.

485
00:50:36,091 --> 00:50:37,822
Oh come on Veer, you
got to be kidding me.

486
00:50:38,897 --> 00:50:40,850
Only after seeing a painting,
It's international

487
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,073
value can be presented to the market.

488
00:50:42,514 --> 00:50:43,552
You know this.

489
00:50:43,717 --> 00:50:45,553
Raunak please, explain him.

490
00:50:46,256 --> 00:50:47,670
These paintings are life.

491
00:50:48,076 --> 00:50:51,958
I will show my paintings after
everything is finalized.

492
00:51:04,506 --> 00:51:05,155
Veer.

493
00:51:05,694 --> 00:51:10,875
They must see the paintings to analyse
the rates of these precious paintings.

494
00:51:11,459 --> 00:51:14,030
Please understand. I
don't want my paintings

495
00:51:14,051 --> 00:51:16,073
to roam around market without destiny.

496
00:51:16,584 --> 00:51:19,961
But for you, we can show them
a single painting.

497
00:51:20,287 --> 00:51:20,842
Yes.

498
00:51:21,889 --> 00:51:25,651
Okay, let's do one thing. We will
show you one single painting.

499
00:51:38,897 --> 00:51:41,045
Wow, like really wow!

"I am sexy Barbie girl."

547
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,476
"Boys, I am a Barbie girl."

548
00:54:56,562 --> 00:54:58,836
"Paint my photo."

549
00:54:58,953 --> 00:55:03,158
"They call me eye candy,
I have goggle on eyes."

550
00:55:03,695 --> 00:55:08,435
"I have dimples on cheeks,
My nails are purple too."

551
00:55:08,547 --> 00:55:12,505
"I am an exclusive model,
My look is very killer."

552
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:17,516
"Kashmiri apple matches with your cheeks."

553
00:55:19,547 --> 00:55:24,126
"I am sexy Barbie girl."
"I am sexy Barbie girl."

554
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:26,953
"Shining beauty like a pearl."

555
00:55:26,976 --> 00:55:31,256
"I am sexy Barbie girl."
"I am sexy Barbie girl."

556
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,522
"I am sexy Barbie girl."

557
00:55:33,609 --> 00:55:36,090
"Shining beauty like a pearl."

558
00:55:36,336 --> 00:55:38,516
"I am sexy Barbie girl."

559
00:55:38,547 --> 00:55:42,828
"Be my sexy Barbie girl."
"Be my sexy Barbie girl."

560
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:45,672
"I am sexy Barbie girl."

561
00:56:03,242 --> 00:56:03,906
Pizza?

562
00:56:04,164 --> 00:56:05,219
Or...

563
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:17,258
(Door opens)

564
00:56:22,169 --> 00:56:27,021
(Background music)

565
00:56:53,521 --> 00:56:54,243
You?

566
00:56:54,887 --> 00:56:57,111
Why are you people here on my bungalow?

567
00:56:58,591 --> 00:57:03,732
Veer relax, we don't have
as such bad intentions.

568
00:57:04,622 --> 00:57:07,216
We have just come to see the paintings.

569
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:11,060
You are not showing us paintings.
What else are we supposed to do?

570
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:15,071
But you shouldn't have come here this way.

571
00:57:15,169 --> 00:57:17,324
We didn’t wanted to come here Raunak.

572
00:57:17,661 --> 00:57:19,614
We were drawn towards veer's paintings.

573
00:57:19,888 --> 00:57:22,710
Oh really, so it is the
mistakes of my paintings?

574
00:57:23,364 --> 00:57:26,423
Veer, Veer, Veer... It's nothing like that,

575
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:28,528
We are just embracing your paintings.

576
00:57:30,637 --> 00:57:31,630
What to do veer,

577
00:57:32,005 --> 00:57:34,060
we are very shameless in business.

578
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:38,919
(Background music)

579
00:57:54,223 --> 00:57:57,161
Raunak, what a beauty.

580
00:57:59,067 --> 00:58:01,669
Veer, you are such an hidden talent man.

581
00:58:02,473 --> 00:58:04,880
You never told us about this painting.

582
00:58:12,224 --> 00:58:16,873
Gorgeous, sexy and seductive.

583
00:58:20,356 --> 00:58:22,231
How dare you, Get out!

584
00:58:24,919 --> 00:58:26,342
Raunak!

585
00:58:29,528 --> 00:58:30,322
Raunak.

586
00:58:33,325 --> 00:58:37,528
And I don’t know what happened after that.

587
00:58:41,177 --> 00:58:45,541
When I woke up, I was alone there.

588
00:58:47,349 --> 00:58:50,074
Veer was not there and also those four.

589
00:58:50,997 --> 00:58:53,528
And I left from there worried.

590
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:00,627
You were injured but
nothing happened to you.

591
00:59:02,356 --> 00:59:06,065
And those disappeared
who were not injured.

592
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,333
Stop.

593
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:14,356
Your story is very deep,

594
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:20,447
tomorrow will be a different day for you.

595
00:59:22,489 --> 00:59:23,911
Your destiny is close,

596
00:59:25,872 --> 00:59:30,261
but reaching there is very difficult.

597
00:59:32,205 --> 00:59:36,783
(Background music)

598
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:48,884
(Background music)

599
01:00:00,355 --> 01:00:02,566
(Background music)

600
01:00:09,847 --> 01:00:16,480
(Sanskrit chants)

601
01:00:30,215 --> 01:00:33,683
(Background music continues)

602
01:01:06,061 --> 01:01:08,257
(Background music)

603
01:01:27,076 --> 01:01:28,697
Veer, you are here?

604
01:01:29,514 --> 01:01:30,976
What do you think of yourself?

605
01:01:31,017 --> 01:01:33,424
- Darling listen to me...
- I was looking for you like crazy.

606
01:01:33,467 --> 01:01:36,350
- And you, you are eating Ice-cream here!
- Aree, Listen to me.

607
01:01:36,391 --> 01:01:37,341
What to listen?

608
01:01:37,905 --> 01:01:39,145
You said you love me.

609
01:01:39,186 --> 01:01:40,967
You said you wanted to be with me.

610
01:01:41,421 --> 01:01:43,535
And you eating ice-cream…

611
01:01:43,576 --> 01:01:45,508
- Relax.
- I don't believe this.

612
01:01:45,549 --> 01:01:47,569
(Raunak crying)

613
01:01:48,405 --> 01:01:50,294
Where did you go?

614
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,365
I missed you.

615
01:01:56,882 --> 01:01:59,385
Veer, I love you.

616
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,530
(Background music)

617
01:02:17,491 --> 01:02:22,016
"Give me permission to live in you."

618
01:02:24,562 --> 01:02:29,451
"Give me a habit of living."

619
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:35,017
"Give me permission to live in you."

620
01:02:35,194 --> 01:02:38,593
"Give me a habit of living."

621
01:02:38,634 --> 01:02:45,616
"Keep your love inside you carefully."

622
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:52,364
"We will fill this empty heart with love."

623
01:02:52,743 --> 01:02:59,299
"We will fill this empty heart with love."

624
01:02:59,853 --> 01:03:06,850
"We will fill this empty heart with love."

625
01:03:06,891 --> 01:03:13,708
"We will fill this empty heart with love."

626
01:03:28,564 --> 01:03:35,581
"I come your ways as the night starts."

627
01:03:42,634 --> 01:03:49,618
"I come your ways as the night starts."

628
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:56,415
"Just like this our love should go on."

629
01:03:56,461 --> 01:04:03,398
"Till now I was alone in this world."

630
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:09,937
"So many seasons passed to get to you."

631
01:04:09,978 --> 01:04:17,443
"Don't drown me with your lips."

632
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:24,546
"We will fill this empty heart with love."

633
01:04:24,587 --> 01:04:31,497
"We will fill this empty heart with love."

634
01:04:31,688 --> 01:04:38,536
"We will fill this empty heart with love."

635
01:04:38,696 --> 01:04:46,029
"We will fill this empty heart with love."

My God!
(Cell ringing)

640
01:05:01,509 --> 01:05:02,219
(Cell ringing)

641
01:05:04,258 --> 01:05:06,809
- Hey Raunak.
- Di.

642
01:05:06,977 --> 01:05:10,676
What is wrong? I have called you 22 times.
Where are you?

643
01:05:11,102 --> 01:05:14,145
Di, where can I go without Veer?

644
01:05:14,383 --> 01:05:15,805
Any leads about Veer?

645
01:05:16,868 --> 01:05:18,368
(Indistinct)

646
01:05:18,409 --> 01:05:20,102
Raunak, did you meet medium?

647
01:05:20,493 --> 01:05:21,493
What did she tell.

648
01:05:21,602 --> 01:05:25,278
Yes jiju, she will start from tomorrow.

649
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:29,415
Listen dear, we are at
airport, me and Roopa.

650
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:31,618
Coming to India soon.

651
01:05:31,931 --> 01:05:33,020
Come on fast.

652
01:05:40,313 --> 01:05:43,860
(Background music)

653
01:05:57,157 --> 01:05:59,296
Whatever's happening in these paintings,

654
01:05:59,962 --> 01:06:01,848
it is not happening in past or future.

655
01:06:02,805 --> 01:06:05,778
It is happening with us in the present.

656
01:06:07,235 --> 01:06:08,501
It is happening there.

657
01:06:09,798 --> 01:06:13,798
And we, we are seeing
through these paintings.

658
01:06:13,852 --> 01:06:15,642
(Background music)

659
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:23,989
These paintings clearly shows that
one by one they are disappearing.

660
01:06:24,194 --> 01:06:26,459
(Background music continues)

661
01:06:28,295 --> 01:06:30,199
It is a game of a spirit.

662
01:06:30,912 --> 01:06:40,332
And in this, which is a spirit and who
is alive, is very diffucult to say.

663
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,918
What you are saying is beyond
my understanding.

664
01:06:47,232 --> 01:06:50,857
We know about these four
but where is Veer?

665
01:06:50,983 --> 01:06:53,366
(Background music continues)

666
01:06:54,373 --> 01:06:55,967
These four must know the answer.

667
01:06:58,108 --> 01:07:04,560
But I am not powerful enough to
pull these out of this painting.

668
01:07:05,608 --> 01:07:08,170
And not even I can go
inside these paintings.

669
01:07:08,211 --> 01:07:10,707
Then how are we going to
find out about Veer?

670
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:20,594
I can at least try to hear what these
four talks through these paintings.

671
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:23,327
But how is this possible?

672
01:07:26,053 --> 01:07:27,424
It is not possible,

673
01:07:28,553 --> 01:07:30,819
I have to make it possible.

674
01:07:34,623 --> 01:07:37,264
(Background music)

675
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:46,357
(Sanskrit chants)

676
01:07:59,498 --> 01:08:03,871
(Sanskrit chants continue)

677
01:08:17,608 --> 01:08:22,037
(Background music)

678
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:06,178
(Background music continues)

679
01:09:27,155 --> 01:09:30,499
(Background music continues)

680
01:10:24,139 --> 01:10:27,728
Bro, what the hell are we doing here bro?

681
01:10:29,178 --> 01:10:30,639
Peeing what else.

682
01:10:30,803 --> 01:10:32,538
(Crickets chirping)

683
01:10:32,579 --> 01:10:35,703
After all this, you can still pee.

684
01:10:36,576 --> 01:10:40,096
But nothing out of me. I
can't think of what to do.

685
01:10:42,311 --> 01:10:45,327
(Background music)

686
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:51,749
(Gasps)

687
01:10:54,592 --> 01:10:55,899
Vikram, car.

688
01:10:57,053 --> 01:10:58,014
Let's go.

689
01:11:01,506 --> 01:11:05,342
(Background music continues)

690
01:11:06,522 --> 01:11:08,868
How did it move of its own?

691
01:11:10,405 --> 01:11:15,927
(Gasps)

692
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:18,319
(Gasps)

693
01:11:19,592 --> 01:11:26,950
Two of our partners are already dead.

694
01:11:27,889 --> 01:11:31,924
Who is next? You or me?

695
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:35,531
I wish, it is no one.

696
01:11:37,631 --> 01:11:39,282
I don't understand.

697
01:11:42,022 --> 01:11:45,869
(Gasps)

698
01:11:46,264 --> 01:11:51,297
(Gasps)

699
01:11:51,389 --> 01:11:54,279
(Background music continues)

700
01:11:54,335 --> 01:11:55,611
Oh shit!

701
01:11:57,858 --> 01:11:58,902
Oh!!

702
01:12:00,131 --> 01:12:01,876
Bobby!

703
01:12:03,404 --> 01:12:04,858
Break is not working.

704
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:11,281
What is happening?

705
01:12:11,491 --> 01:12:14,210
(Background music)

706
01:12:16,061 --> 01:12:19,525
- Bobby!
- Vikram!

707
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:24,441
(Gasps)

708
01:12:38,788 --> 01:12:39,592
Oh!

709
01:12:40,241 --> 01:12:41,202
Veer?

710
01:12:42,577 --> 01:12:46,811
(Background music)

711
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:53,411
(Gasps)

712
01:13:06,553 --> 01:13:10,623
(Car sound)

713
01:13:10,967 --> 01:13:13,077
(Gasps)

714
01:13:13,147 --> 01:13:17,026
(Car sound)

715
01:13:17,171 --> 01:13:19,614
(Moaning)

716
01:13:23,592 --> 01:13:27,453

718
01:13:45,092 --> 01:13:47,764

(Car screeching)

720
01:14:11,874 --> 01:14:19,692
Nooooo!

721
01:14:25,006 --> 01:14:27,819
It is clearly depicted
from there discussions

722
01:14:28,154 --> 01:14:31,426
that they took Veer to city hospital.

723
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,999
City hospital? But why?

724
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:40,504
- We will have to go there to find out.
- Everything is fine right?

725
01:14:41,827 --> 01:14:46,638
Nothing is right. One by one
they are disappearing.

726
01:14:47,397 --> 01:14:51,496
On the other hand, Veer's missing.

727
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:56,751

I came to India to surprise my brother.

881
01:36:20,222 --> 01:36:21,918
Then this tragedy happened to me.

882
01:36:24,121 --> 01:36:27,659
To keep them away from the
paintings, I weaved this web.

Does Veer know about you?

886
01:36:36,356 --> 01:36:37,626
He doesn't know anything

887
01:36:37,989 --> 01:36:39,457
because he is still unconscious.

889
01:36:40,473 --> 01:36:44,812
Raunak, don't tell him
anything about my death.

(Veer gasps)

914
01:39:55,942 --> 01:39:56,793
Oh shit!

915
01:39:57,543 --> 01:40:01,008
Now no one can stop us from
taking away these paintings.

916
01:40:01,153 --> 01:40:03,933
That is fine but if anything
happens to him then?

917
01:40:03,974 --> 01:40:06,465
- Let's take him to the hospital first.
- Yes.

918
01:40:06,506 --> 01:40:07,200
Let's go.

919
01:40:08,176 --> 01:40:09,403

01:40:46,723 --> 01:40:52,944
(Police siren sound)

922
01:40:53,785 --> 01:40:55,479
Oh police, run!

923
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:56,574
- Police!
- Guys.

924
01:40:56,615 --> 01:40:58,035

925
01:40:58,653 --> 01:40:59,856

01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:41,481
(Background music)

929
01:41:42,949 --> 01:41:45,736
Veer, we have an angel in our life.

930
01:41:46,918 --> 01:41:48,293
Who has united us!

931
01:41:50,207 --> 01:41:53,915
And to introduce that angel
is this Hasmukh brother.
