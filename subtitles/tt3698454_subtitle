00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,480
[First frame]

2
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,960
"Buddy!"

3
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,440
'There were four of us.'

4
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,400
'Protectors of each other.'

5
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,400
'Time was against us.'

6
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,760
'Angry with us.'

7
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,160
'But never could break us.'

8
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,600
'But this time isn't angry with us.'

9
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,800
'This time it hates us.'

10
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,440
Happy Anniversary.

11
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,320
Happy Anniversary.

12
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,360
Happy Anniversary.

13
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,080
I can see it in his eyes..

14
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,520
..your husband wants to kill me.

15
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,320
Then I suggest you marry me.

16
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,760
I will dump him.

17
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,640
After marriage, we'll become..

18
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,000
.. ugly to each other from
every point of view, sweetheart.

19
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,640
Let this continue.

20
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,360
Tanu isn't here.

21
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,400
She's coming.

22
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,840
She will be here after picking
up Tinku from school. Straightaway.

23
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,240
What's up?

24
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,920
Get lost.

25
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,760
Tanu.

26
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,400
What are you doing here?

27
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,520
How are you?

28
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,360
He hits you, doesn't he?

29
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,400
At least he's with me.

30
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,480
Look, leave me to my whatever
and whichever condition I am, Mitwa.

31
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,880
It's too late now.

32
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,520
Son.

33
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,920
Is he Tinku?

34
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,440
His name is Parag.

35
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,800
Parag! Nice name.

36
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,640
Parag, son..

37
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,400
- He doesn't need to know..
- Mitwa.

38
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,160
Come.

39
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,560
Sorry, ma'am, please. Allow us.

40
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,320
Madam.

41
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,880
Come on.

42
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,560
- But why are you..
- Please come along..

43
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,000
We're meeting him after 11-years.

44
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,120
- Come, son.
- Where are you taking us?

45
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,360
This is amazing.

46
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,080
You didn't recognise me yet.

47
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,160
No.

48
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,280
20-years-ago, Billore village.

49
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,200
Where you guys were arrested.

50
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,240
There was only one Sardar
on the entire battalion.

51
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,800
Yes, I get it.

52
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,840
So must have been
promoted to higher ranks.

53
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,800
Joint-Director CBI.

54
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,360
Joint-Director CBI..

55
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,680
And I've had eyes
on your gang since day 1.

56
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,040
Are you still in contact
with your friends, or not?

57
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,600
They have all turned
into respectable businessmen.

58
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,680
Only you couldn't quit your nature.

59
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,640
Let's reminisce
these memories later.

60
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,000
First, tell me why am I here?

61
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,560
A year ago Baldev
Tyagi was murdered.

62
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,280
Carried out by Shakeel
on Durani's orders..the murder.

63
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,160
You selected the
boys who killed him.

64
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,520
Some of them have been arrested..

65
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,600
..and they mentioned
your name as well.

66
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,280
"Rewrite.."

67
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,040
"Rewrite.."

68
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,640
"Rewrite my destiny again."

69
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,800
"Rewrite.."

70
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,240
"Rewrite.."

71
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,840
"Rewrite.."

72
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:51,280
"Rewrite my destiny again."

73
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,280
"Rewrite.."

74
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,600
"We're greedy for
your benevolence.."

75
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,800
"..all my wishes are chaste."

76
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,320
"Every moment is like a trial.."

77
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,080
"..but everything still
feels like a coincidence."

78
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,360
"You're the one
that dwells in me.."

79
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,920
"..this is your miracle."

80
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,000
"Rewrite.."

81
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,520
"Rewrite.."

82
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,680
"Rewrite.."

83
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,000
"Rewrite.."

84
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,440
CBI's arrested him.

85
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,200
And they have evidence
against Mitwa.

86
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,080
That bloody Mitwa..

87
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,320
Why Shakeel?

88
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,360
Why did he have to
lock horns with Shakeel?

89
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,200
Shakeel, the guy you
deceived and came to Delhi..

90
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,080
He's looking for you.

91
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,760
And Shakeel's men
are in every jail, Mitwa.

92
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,000
If you get jailed for even 15
days someone will kill you in jail.

93
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,520
Would you become an approver?

94
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,200
The court will go easy on you.

95
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,080
And later you can start a new life.

96
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,600
Rizwan sir, are you coming?

97
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,560
Yeah..

98
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,280
By the time we find out, one
of his guys will kill Mitwa in jail.

99
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,800
What do you want?

100
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,880
Mitwa will have to face his destiny.

101
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,960
He's our friend.

102
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,720
What do you want?

103
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,440
Shall we load up and set out?

104
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,600
We would've done it 20-years-ago.

105
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,640
What has changed?

106
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,760
Is your reputation coming
between our friendship?

107
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,400
Look..

108
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,880
You know that's not the case.

109
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,440
What?

110
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,480
What are you thinking?

111
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,760
That your gang will save you.

112
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,320
The Awesome Foursome gang lives on.

113
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,800
Stop. Stop.

114
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Where do you think you're going?
Get down.

115
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,560
Can't you see the Thakur's
mansion is on this side?

116
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,440
Please bless my son, priest.

117
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,000
So he joins the
army when he grows up.

118
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,360
Of course, he'll join
the army and make you proud.

119
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,880
Tell him to bring
my mother back to life.

120
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,680
Son, your mother isn't dead.

121
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,960
No one ever dies.

122
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,920
They all fulfil their responsibilities
and go dwell in the skies.

123
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,000
Greetings.

124
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,040
Greetings.

125
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,680
Who is Chand?

126
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,560
I am Chand.

127
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
The condition in Pakistan
is still pretty bad.

128
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,400
Not just the Hindus, even the Muslims
who migrated from here are cursing now.

129
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,640
I thought since he's
your childhood friend..

130
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:55,960
..even though he ends up dead, but
you must save his son Mitwa's life.

131
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,000
Will you keep him?

132
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,760
Come.

133
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,680
Don't be scared.

134
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,400
Look at me.

135
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,200
[chanting prayer]

136
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,240
We're untouchables
to them so to say..

137
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,040
But their lust sees no barriers..

138
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,160
My wife

139
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,720
..never utters a word. But
I can see the hatred in her eyes.

140
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,040
The thing that's
going on in your mind..

141
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,040
..is more dangerous.

142
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,960
My desire may be small,
Chand, but even I am a man.

143
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,800
I'll die with honour.

144
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,960
It will fire only
one round at a time.

145
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,680
Someone's hunting quails, master.

146
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,680
Master. Master.

147
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,000
Phagun!

148
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,320
Mitwa!

149
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,560
Where the hell do they disappear?

150
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,560
Always playing outside!

151
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,800
Hey..

152
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,040
Come here.

153
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,360
Hey..

154
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,480
Chand.

155
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,440
You made this..

156
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,400
..didn't you, that was
used to kill my brother.

157
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,560
It's loaded.

158
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,160
Come on, shoot yourself.

159
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,520
Thakur..

160
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,600
No..

161
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,960
No, no, no..

162
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,280
Father!

163
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,680
Father!

164
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,480
'No one ever dies.'

165
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,720
'They all fulfil their responsibilities
and go dwell in the skies.'

166
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,080
How did this fire start?

167
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,600
How did this fire start?

168
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,160
Water. Bring water.

169
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,680
Put more water, fools.

170
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,520
Run!

171
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,320
Catch them! Catch them!

172
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,680
What's this?

173
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,960
What's in the bag? Check.

174
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,280
- What happened here?
- My brother is sick.

175
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,000
I am taking him to the hospital.

176
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,640
- Fine. Check their bags.
- Okay.

177
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,800
Luggage.

178
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,000
Catch.

179
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,800
Throw it.

180
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,120
What happened?

181
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,680
We don't even know your name?

182
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,000
Chaman.

183
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,400
What's my name?

184
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,560
Chaman.

185
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,920
Trust me.

186
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Come on.

187
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,480
Come in.

188
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,880
Phagun and Mitwa.

189
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,760
Say hi.

190
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,080
Got wounded by a knife
and the Police came sniffing.

191
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,880
But these two kids were amazing.

192
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,160
They are clever. Very clever.

193
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,440
Three.

194
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,160
Let them work with
Bahadur and Rizwan.

195
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,880
Bahadur.

196
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,320
That's Bahadur. And he's Rizwan.

197
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
What's this?

198
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,480
What's the job?

199
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,240
Nothing. You only have to
work for a couple of days a week.

200
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,160
- Is that it?
-Yes.

201
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,160
That's all.

202
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,960
You've to take some stuff across.

203
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,640
And bring some stuff over here.

204
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,120
On this side of the river is India
and on the other side is Nepal.

205
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,320
We smuggle things, boss.

206
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,080
Can you run fast?

207
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,800
When I start running
you can only see a blur.

208
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,800
And our kiddie gang is ready.

209
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,680
- Little Gang.
- No, no..Nah.

210
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,720
Awesome..

211
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,160
The awesome foursome.

212
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,960
Jeevan Dai.

213
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,480
Coming.

214
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,440
- So long, Jeevan Dai.
-So long.

215
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:48,960
"With a piece of the
sun stashed in their pockets.."

216
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,600
"..and away they go.."

217
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:03,880
"With the wind under their wings."

218
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,680
"They are innocent.."

219
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,840
"..there's fun in the air."

220
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,600
"Take a sip from
the cup of friendship."

221
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,280
"With lots of courage."

222
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,560
"They light their desires with
with their thoughts."

223
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,160
"And let their thoughts soar."

224
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,800
"With their courage
they light their lives."

225
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,360
"Make the light shine even
in darkness."

226
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:51,160
"They only care about their happiness."

227
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:58,080
"They have small desires
in their hearts."

228
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:25,800
"Carrying their dreams
in their pockets."

229
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:31,400
"And the tales of their childhood.."

230
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,920
"..are endless with no speed limit."

231
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,640
"They light up their
hearts with their desires."

232
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,240
"And let their thoughts soar."

233
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,520
"With their courage
they light their lives."

234
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,120
"Make the light shine even
in darkness."

235
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:05,520
"They only care about their happiness."

236
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,040
- Jeevan Dai.
- Hello. - Hello.

237
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,040
How are you?

238
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,720
Take a look.

239
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,440
Great.

240
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,560
Consider it done.

241
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,200
Show me what's in it.

242
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,160
- There's nothing, sir.
- Only clothes. - What's this?

243
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,600
- Take a look.
- Anything else.

244
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,040
Only clothes and other things.

245
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,200
- And what's in the car?
- He stole my money.

246
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,880
What are you doing?

247
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,640
How dare you accuse me of stealing?

248
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,040
What do we do with this?

249
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,520
Leave. Leave.

250
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,520
Why are you two fighting?

251
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,400
I will kill you.

252
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,920
- Come on, don't hit the police.
- Sorry sir, I'll handle him.

253
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,080
Give it back.

254
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,040
If he doesn't stop
now I'll break his head.

255
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,240
One-two-one!

256
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,480
One-two-one!

257
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,840
Phagun..

258
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,640
..they are teenagers. Kids.

259
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,880
The Landlord has the Police
and the government on his side.

260
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,560
What can these kids do?

261
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,320
But they are going to win.

262
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,280
How can they win?

263
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,200
Go back and give this.
You will get your money.

264
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,480
Not yet.

265
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,920
Room no. 453. 2 o'clock.

266
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:29,280
"You turned a decent
man..inhumane."

267
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,360
- Uncle, that's a sweet song.
- Right.

268
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,840
But what does inhumane mean?

269
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,000
Don't ask about the meaning.

270
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,680
It's a sad song that
touches the heart.

271
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,000
So just enjoy..

272
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,160
They are here.

273
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,120
Who is here?

274
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,800
- Hello.
- Greetings.

275
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,400
Where is everyone?

276
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
Come down.

277
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,960
Sir, you should rest.
You must be tired.

278
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,040
- Take him in.
- Go on.

279
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,240
Who is the guy who just arrived?

280
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,040
You can meet him later.

281
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,600
He's resting.

282
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,960
Let me introduce you to him.

283
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,920
He's his trusted aid. Fakeera.

284
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,200
He's from Rajasthan.

285
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,080
He must have thought of something
before taking this decision.

286
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,280
And you guys have never
done this job before.

287
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,560
We're talking about a bank.

288
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,800
That's alright. But has
anyone ever been to Patna before?

289
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,680
Don't worry, guys. I am there.

290
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,920
I'll take you to the
best place in Patna. The best.

291
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,800
Bro, I am from Patna.

292
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,720
I'll be returning home after
30-years to rob a bank. Imagine that.

293
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,880
I'll make it very clear.

294
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,400
I'm not going to rob the bank.

295
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,440
I'll wait in the car and
you guys can carry on looting.

296
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,880
Wait..I still don't understand
why we're going to Patna.

297
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,400
There are banks here too.

298
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,280
So people believe that the
bank was robbed by the outfit.

299
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:49,960
You guys can throw leaflets inside and
outside the bank with their names on it.

300
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,800
Look, we have no
grudge with the outfit.

301
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:53,840
What's the point?

302
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,760
Look, son, those who want to
get rid of the outfit will help us.

303
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,720
If one of you get caught.

304
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,440
And you won't find an easier job.

305
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,080
Phagun, what are you staring at?

306
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,800
What's wrong?

307
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,400
Phagun?

308
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,280
What's wrong?

309
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,280
Phagun..

310
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,640
- What happened?
- No, we'll go to Patna, sir.

311
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,560
Why are you staring at me?

312
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,080
No, it's nothing.

313
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,440
Good.

314
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,640
If the Police doesn't kill
us this heat definitely will.

315
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,880
Thank God the lane is deserted.

316
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,120
Are you from Patna?

317
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,400
- Why? What do you want?
- No..

318
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,720
- Who is speaking?
- Makhaniya Kumar.

319
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,080
Makhaniya Kumar, I see..

320
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,960
- Come on.
- Uncle, start the car.

321
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,480
Boxes. Throw the boxes.

322
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,880
Jack. Where's the jack?

323
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,800
What's wrong?

324
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,840
- Cover. Take cover.
- Who's firing?

325
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,680
Rascal.

326
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,280
"They are out to rob the world."

327
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,480
"They are out to fool the world."

328
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,200
"They are out to rob the world."

329
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,960
"Evil..evil..evil.."

330
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,480
Police. Police. Back. Back.

331
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,440
No one dies.

332
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,160
Police again.

333
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,360
Back. Back.

334
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,840
Keep going uncle,
I'll take care of them.

335
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,760
I am going to show you today..

336
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,960
Uncle, take cover. Take cover.

337
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,600
Mitwa.

338
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,360
What?

339
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,160
Come here.

340
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,280
Why you..

341
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,440
- Throw that sack.
- What?

342
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,920
They are out to fool the world

343
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,440
"They are out to rob the world."

344
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,760
Great, son. Now let's go.

345
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,760
Come on.

346
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,440
Uncle.

347
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,680
- Uncle.
- Can't breathe..Can't..

348
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,680
Uncle, you're okay. You're okay.

349
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,560
Come here, guys.

350
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,000
Mitwa, look.

351
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,680
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

352
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,640
Uncle, keep breathing.
Keep breathing.

353
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,480
Cover his wound.
Stop the bleeding.

354
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,280
He returned home
after 30-years, and..

355
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,680
I told you let's not go to Patna.

356
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,080
But you never listen..

357
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,600
Chaman uncle.

358
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,240
And all because of the same guy..

359
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,680
How much?

360
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,240
We didn't count.

361
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,120
Remember blacksmith
Chand from your area.

362
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,600
Chand the blacksmith?

363
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,520
Yes.

364
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,200
He had two small kids.

365
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,280
Yes.

366
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,800
What have you done?

367
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,040
This is personal, uncle.

368
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,040
Those who want out can do so now.

369
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,520
Those who want a fight can try.

370
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,040
What are you doing?

371
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,440
I will kill him.

372
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,040
Go ahead.

373
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,800
Bas***

374
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,680
Take me in your gang.

375
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,640
I will never betray you, believe me.

376
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,520
You just betrayed your chief.

377
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,440
I was talking about friends.

378
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,280
I never betray my friends.

379
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:43,600
[regional language song]

380
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:11,760
"While befriending
our dreams..we went on."

381
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:21,800
"While knitting the
stars..we kept knitting."

382
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,120
"The heart had no idea.."

383
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:33,480
"..we marched on
holding our heart."

384
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,240
"What is this heart, why is it?"

385
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,440
"We had it under wraps."

386
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,360
"What is this heart, why is it?"

387
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,440
"We had it under wraps."

388
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,720
"Without a care.."

389
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,640
"Without a care.."

390
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,920
"Without a care.."

391
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,480
"Without a care.."

392
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,600
Come on, guys.

393
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,920
We got to change this truck, guys.

394
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,000
We don't all fit in here now.

395
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,600
Anybody there?

396
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:48,960
I am.

397
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,320
Can we get some food?

398
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,080
We've potatoes and rice.

399
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,520
Is that all?
No lentil.

400
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,440
Sorry, no lentil.

401
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,320
What kind of an eating joint
is this? No bread, no lentil.

402
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,600
This is all we have.

403
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,040
People have no food at home,
what are they going to sell?

404
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,160
No food? Why?

405
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,960
What world do you live in, mister?

406
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,640
The entire country
is facing this crisis.

407
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,680
Reporter.

408
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,120
The landlord has food grains..

409
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,040
..but he'll sell it when
people are on the verge of dying.

410
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,400
At double the rate.

411
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,080
We should start here.

412
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,400
People are decent and
the government's ruthless.

413
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,360
Where is the Landlord's storehouse?

414
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,960
Lala, this lock..

415
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,280
What does Amitabh Bachchan say?

416
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,200
I'll take this lock from
your pocket and open it.

417
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,200
Lala, I'll take this lock
from your pocket and open it.

418
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,400
Lala, stop tormenting the poor.

419
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,560
This storehouse will stay open.

420
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:30,400
I and the others have decided
that the poor and starved..

421
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,840
What are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

422
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,640
Why?

423
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,120
Don't try to be a hero.
Look at the situation.

424
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,040
Or why don't you inform me earlier?
We'll charge a fee.

425
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:36,720
So what?

426
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,400
Can we get a piece of land to buy?

427
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,200
Yes, of course.

428
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,600
Of course.

429
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,480
Great. Thank you very much.

430
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:54,640
"Trying to gather the
pieces in which you hid.."

431
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:06,840
"..trying to cajole the
moments that were yours."

432
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:17,040
"Weaving dreams that can come true."

"I've found the path.."

436
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,480
"..which the weather
was trying to show me."

437
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,760
"Without a care.."

438
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,440
"Without a care.."

439
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,200
"Without a care.."

440
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,720
"Without a care.."

441
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,320
Bahadur..shoot like a pro.

442
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,760
- I know.
- So you shoot first and me second.

443
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,080
- Mitwa.
- Yeah..

444
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,680
Look there.
Something's moving.

445
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,560
Looks like a rabbit.

446
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,960
- Yeah..
- Shoot it.

447
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,280
That's Rizwan.

448
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:37,840
Where are you going?

449
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,000
Someone fired a gun.

450
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,840
Rizwan.

451
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,680
Asshole.

452
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,680
You shot me in the ass.

453
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,280
Run for it.

454
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,920
With friends like
you who needs enemies.

455
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,520
Don't come any closer.

456
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,720
- Listen to me.
- Or I will kill you.

457
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,760
I thought it was a rabbit.

458
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,720
Do I look like a rabbit to you?
Am I a rabbit?

459
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,600
Asshole..

460
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,840
Come on..we'll stitch you up.

461
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,280
Mitwa Shaheriya, get up.
To the court.

462
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,120
Param, there are
some guys at the gate.

463
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,000
They are calling you outside.

464
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,400
Come, son.

465
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,080
Who did Tanu come with?

466
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,200
Madhu hit him again.

467
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,000
Who is in the car?

468
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,760
Police.

469
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,120
Good afternoon, Mr. Paramveer.

470
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,800
Or should I call
you by your old name?

471
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,080
Phagun.

472
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,200
That's the same guy.

473
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,200
Phagun Gadoliya.

474
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,320
Bahadur. Rizwan.

475
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,840
I have Mitwa.

476
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,240
I came to drop Tanuja.

477
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,720
I just wanted to see whether
this is the right address.

478
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,200
This is the right address.

479
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,560
I might have to come back.

480
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,840
Come inside, let's talk.

481
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,680
Some other time.

482
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,880
I am the Joint Director CBI now.

483
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,000
I hope you're not
planning to save Mitwa.

484
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,760
He's been arrested for
a very high profile case.

485
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,880
There are many big
names connected to it.

486
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:33,080
You see..this case
is my retirement plan.

487
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,640
Later it will make me the
member of the Planning Commission..

488
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,600
..or the ambassador of
some small beautiful country.

489
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,120
So please don't try anything..

490
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,200
..which compels me to
destroy your beautiful world.

491
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,400
- Understand.
- Destroy what?

492
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,440
- Destroy what?
- Let it be. Come on.

493
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,560
How dare you threaten me in my home.

494
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,280
Get lost.

495
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,320
Come on.

496
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,280
Close the gate!

497
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,040
Come here. Come here.

498
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,080
You hit Tanu again.

499
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,480
Remember what I said will
happen if this happens again.

500
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,360
What else? You will kill me.

501
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,240
We won't kill you.

502
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,280
Mitwa's back in town
and he knows everything.

503
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,720
- He will kill you. Leave me.
- Mitwa's back.

504
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,720
Where is Mitwa?

505
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,080
I said leave me!

506
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,400
Stay away from Mitwa.

507
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,760
Like he did for 20-years.

508
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,600
Maybe he was embarrassed.

509
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,760
Time flew by..

510
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,280
You had forgotten him, Param.

511
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,680
If he hadn't returned to
Delhi and hadn't been arrested..

512
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,160
- ..then you had forgotten..
- No!

513
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,600
I always missed him.

514
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,320
And whenever I did
I used to feel happy.

515
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,040
And if I don't help him this time..

516
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,720
..then next time when I
think of him, I'll feel embarrassed.

517
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,920
I am not worried about myself.

518
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,600
But for Arjun.

519
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,200
I won't do anything.

520
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,800
We won't do anything.

521
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,680
We've hired someone else.

522
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,720
No bloodshed.

523
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,240
Absolutely not.

524
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,640
Good morning.

525
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,520
Who are these two?

526
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,960
They are with me. My friends.

527
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,560
They can be trusted.

528
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,600
Trusted?

529
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,080
They look high.

530
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,040
No, sir. I just have a cold.

531
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,440
Both of you?

532
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,840
No, sir. I had a cold first,
then he got it from me.

533
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,840
Were you licking each other's face?

534
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:07,840
What's your name?

535
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,120
Do you have a driving licence?

536
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,240
We do, sir.

537
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,600
He's Tony, I am Titu.

538
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:13,880
Tony, Titu.

539
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,560
Mitwa returned to the city
to kill you and got arrested.

540
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,800
Don't be scared.

541
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,520
And you're going to save him..

542
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,280
..because that's that only way
to apologise to him.

543
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,760
Absolutely. Absolutely.

544
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,520
No bloodshed.

545
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,160
No.. never..

546
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,280
And don't get caught.

547
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,440
Otherwise, we'll kill you
in Police custody.

548
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,680
Take this mobile.

549
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,200
If you want to convey
anything call on it, okay.

550
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,080
Are you twins?

551
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,480
Yes, sir.

552
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,480
- Sita and Gita.
- No, sir.

553
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,680
Where is that Sardar?

554
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,160
He must be somewhere around.

555
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,720
He'll pop out of somewhere.

556
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,400
I used to wait at
the bus stop for hours.

557
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,200
- So romantic.
- I didn't know.

558
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,280
I used to hit on her.

559
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,520
Not him..

560
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,600
I wonder where he came from.

561
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,520
Here you go..enjoy.

562
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,080
What a feast. Is this
my last wish getting fulfilled?

563
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,360
Something like that.

564
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,880
Get me out of here! I am bleeding!

565
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,280
Yes.

566
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:29,840
What?

567
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,560
- What happened, sir?
- Let's get going.

568
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,280
I don't know whether we've been
duped or on the verge of getting duped.

569
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,280
Let's get going.

570
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,440
Of course.

571
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,600
Make him sit here.

572
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,440
Sit here.

573
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,040
- Where's the doctor?
- There he is.

574
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:49,840
I see..

575
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:58,880
Hello.

576
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,120
Your dear parents
are with us, Madan.

577
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,680
They are very happy now.

578
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,160
Once we get Mitwa
back safe and sound..

579
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,200
..we'll send them back
home after a movie-show or two.

580
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,840
- Aunty..
- Yes, son.

581
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:12,920
Anything to eat?

582
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,800
No, son. You already fed me a lot.

583
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,920
Did you hear that?

584
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,080
Who was it?

585
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,760
Listen to me, sir.

586
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:37,400
You're detaining me forcefully, sir.

587
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,680
I never drink.

588
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:47,440
If you had a wife like mine then
you would've understood my life.

589
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,480
I'll go ask.

590
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,760
Sit down.

591
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,280
Be quiet.

592
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,880
Why are you troubling us sir?

593
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,520
But, sir..

594
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,000
And you guys..

595
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,360
See..

596
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,840
Which way is the Emergency ward?

597
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,840
This way.

598
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,120
What..

599
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,640
Sir..
You're killing a policeman.

600
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,560
Quiet.

601
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:20,960
Come on, Titu.

602
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,960
Rascals..

603
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,800
Stay still.

604
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,600
What's going on?

605
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,440
Keep it down.

606
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,920
What are you doing?

607
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:40,760
Get in.

608
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,160
Tell Sharma to put
more men in the hospital.

609
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,920
No one moves until
I don't get there.

610
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,040
Those bloody.. Damnit!

611
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,400
After so long.

612
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,720
- Is it too deep?
- I had to.

613
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,720
2 million.

614
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,280
Return the mobile.

615
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,560
Fools, you guys killed a Policeman.

616
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,960
I told you not to.

617
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,960
We had to.

618
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,000
We had no option.
We had to save Mitwa.

619
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,880
We risked our lives
to save him and yet..

620
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:29,920
Get lost.

621
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,280
I am letting you go
because you saved my life.

622
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,800
If you touch Tanu again
I'll forget this favour.

623
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,800
Go.

624
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,240
Where did these camels come from?

625
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,440
There's so many of them.

626
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,080
Where did they come from?

627
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,880
They are surrounding us.

628
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,440
Madan, who are they?

629
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,200
Madan..

630
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,000
Madan, who are they?

631
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,160
Leave me.

632
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,480
Madan..

633
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:23,920
Tony..

634
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,920
This hotel is ours.
We just bought it.

635
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,600
It's a little dilapidated,
but just adequate for you.

636
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,960
- More.
-Stop.

637
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:46,840
Here you go.

638
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,960
Rascal, you didn't
stop shaking your ass..

639
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,600
The girls of Delhi
are crazy about my walk.

640
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,520
That's why I never got married.

641
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,040
I get to maintain variety in life.

642
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,360
I am very famous.

643
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,920
You're not famous. You're infamous.

644
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,600
That's what you believe,
king of Nepal.

645
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,640
Go ask those who sigh at my name.

646
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,800
Of course, they utter
his name too..but with manners.

647
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,520
Mr. Bahadur, Bahadur sir.

648
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,240
I caused you guys a lot of trouble.

649
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:32,920
What?

650
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,960
After all these years
I was missing Tanu..

651
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,280
..and I came here without thinking.

652
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,440
You guys have taken
good care of Tanu.

653
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,440
Why did you leave, Tanu?

654
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,760
I got arrested for a petty case.

655
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,960
For 6-months.

656
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,920
We weren't married
yet and Tanu was pregnant.

657
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,040
That's when she met Madan.

658
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,000
And I was locked up.

659
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,480
That bas*** fulfilled
his responsibilities..

660
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,440
..but he used to hit her.

661
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,600
He used to hit Tanu.

662
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:14,880
We've permanently
solved Tanu's problem.

663
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,640
You never came to meet us, Mitwa.

664
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,320
Why?

665
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,800
I wasn't in India when
you guys got out of jail.

666
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,200
I wasn't here.

667
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,400
Later I didn't return
fearing this question.

668
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,560
What would I say?

669
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,880
Why is Shakeel after your life?

670
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,560
Didn't you two worked
for Durani together?

671
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,720
I never met Durani.

672
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,960
He lives in Romania.

673
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,640
Shakeel and I did
a small job for him.

674
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,960
Look boss, Shakeel and I were partners.

675
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,400
One day I found out that he never
gave me my entire share of the deal.

676
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,720
I got a new deal..

677
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,720
I kept all the money.

678
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,760
That's why they are looking for me.

679
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,880
Bro, I'll pay Shakeel.

680
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,320
Bury it.

681
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,920
Phagun, get me out of here.

682
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,320
Once I get to Nepal I'll be safe.

683
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,840
Arjun. Go inside.

684
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,520
Arjun, go inside.

685
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,520
Yeah, okay.

686
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,120
If you need anything
buy it from the market.

687
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:11,960
I'll talk to you later.

688
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,480
I've kept enough money.

689
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:14,920
Yes, madam.

690
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,760
Go on, I'll call you later.

691
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,480
Where are you going?

692
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,200
Don't you think I should
take Arjun far away from this?

693
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,160
You stay loyal to your friend..

694
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,200
..and Arjun will
have to pay the price.

695
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,720
Can we go inside and talk.

696
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,200
The people you're protecting
Mitwa from don't waste time.

697
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,280
Yesterday you did that job
and today they sent you a reply.

698
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,560
I'm going over to my mother's.

699
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,800
I was very happy, Param.

700
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,440
But seems like the
old days have returned.

701
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,440
We've been going around in circles.

702
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,320
Take a good look, son.

703
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,800
You'll never see a college again.

704
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:28,680
Shut up.

705
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,200
Enroll yoursef.

706
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,200
Where's D-Block?

707
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,400
Next left.

708
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,680
Matches? Just a minute.

709
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:44,680
What happened?

710
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,080
61-people were
massacred in Jahanabad.

711
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,680
Including 15 children.

712
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,160
"Comrade Sumaya.."

713
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:10,040
"The massacre in Jahanabad
has taken a heavy toll."

714
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,320
"The problems of
farmers and workers.."

715
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,760
"Unemployment.."

716
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,920
"Politicians and middlemen
looting the country..

717
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,400
"Even the students must
raise weapons against them."

718
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,480
"I'm sending five
comrades from my cell.."

719
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,680
Looking for the hospital.

720
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,440
Did you bring the stuff?

721
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,280
Does this work?

722
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,200
I hope it's not made
from sticks and stones.

723
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,280
Test it.

724
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,320
Here's 2000.

725
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,040
That's 1000 less.

726
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,760
The deal was 500 rupees per piece.

727
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,400
We'll adjust that in the next deal.

728
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,960
Mister, you're not buying grocery.

729
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:51,040
These are guns we're talking about.

730
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,400
There's no guarantee of a long life.

731
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,760
And if you don't survive
until the next assignment..

732
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,040
..then who's going
to make adjustments?

733
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,400
You guys are new to this trade.

734
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,240
This is not a trade.

735
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:08,400
Sudhir, it's the language.
It's the way they speak.

736
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,000
What business are we in?

737
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:26,200
You seize lands from all
the landlords and high-class people.

738
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,280
And since they have more money,
you take that from them.

739
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,120
- We take it from them.
- Yes.

740
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,120
And what do we do with that money?

741
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,240
Well..

742
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,200
We'll accept 2000 rupees.

743
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,200
We'll adjust next time.

744
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,400
Phagun, what are you doing?

745
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,560
There's nothing we can do
if they don't have money right now.

746
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,000
They need it too.

747
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,160
Your name's Phagun.

748
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:04,400
Yes..

749
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,240
It's very..

750
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,120
poetic.

751
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:12,640
What?

752
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,080
Poetic meaning romantic.

753
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,120
You see, my name means
the onset of summer.

754
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,200
There we go again.

755
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:28,240
I was born in March,
so my parents named me Phagun.

756
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,160
- What is your good name?
-Sukanya.

757
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:32,040
Su..

758
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,440
Beautiful woman.

759
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:36,440
Nice.

760
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:37,680
Shall we?

761
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,480
Okay. Bye.

762
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:50,280
What?

763
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,560
One has to handle such men as well.

764
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,560
It's crucial for our movement.

765
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,080
Fakeera..you bought
these raw tomatoes.

766
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,640
You can't do a single thing right.

767
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,120
That bag of grocery is
worth 16 rupees, can you imagine.

768
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,160
For the entire week.

769
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:07,800
- Fakeera, can you handle the Mirzapur j
- Indian Cinema's popular singer..

770
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,760
- ..Mukesh passed away.
- Then get to work from tomorrow.

771
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,560
He was 53-years-old.

772
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:12,520
Raise the volume.

773
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,520
- I just heard him in the morning.
- Mr. Raj Kapoor said that..

774
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,760
..we've lost a golden voice.

775
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,640
Mukesh was born on 22nd July 1923

776
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,600
- They were just playing his song on the
- in Delhi's Kayasth family.

777
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,280
"When the sun sets far away.."

778
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,000
Mitwa, come inside!

779
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,200
Rizwan, get the guns.

780
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,240
Oh, it's you.
What brings you here?

781
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:46,600
- How are you?
- I am great.

782
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,880
- This is Himanshu.
- How are you?

783
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:49,760
I am fine.

784
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,360
- Do you know her?
- Fakeera.

785
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,200
How are you?

786
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:55,880
He's my good friend Mitwa.

787
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,560
- And he..
- Hello. Sukanya.

788
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,120
- And that's Fakeera.
- Hello.

789
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,200
Come here.

790
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:04,080
Come here. Come here.

791
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,840
Do you know her?

792
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,120
We met in Delhi.

793
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,880
For that job we did.

794
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,000
You didn't tell me about her.

795
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,800
Can we talk alone?

796
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:12,880
Go on.

797
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:13,560
Let's go outside.

798
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,000
Another job for the outfit.

799
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:16,960
Didn't I tell you no?

800
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,360
And yet you brought her here.

801
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,000
I didn't bring her here.

802
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,640
She wanted to come here.

803
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,600
You'll get us killed
someday, Himanshu.

804
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,200
He's been shot in the leg.

805
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:27,400
The wound's getting worse.

806
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:30,240
If we take him to a doctor
he'll lose only part of his leg.

807
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:33,280
He's an important party member,
we can't afford to lose him.

808
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,920
You'll get paid. And in full.

809
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,120
What?

810
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,840
Well bullets are unpredictable.

811
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:46,320
If you hadn't hit me here, and here inst
I wouldn't have said a word, Rizwan.

812
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,240
You got shot in the bum
because your friend fired..

813
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,440
Even God wants..

814
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,400
The lady from Delhi.

815
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,120
What brings you here?

816
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,720
Was the stuff defective?

817
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,840
- I live in this area now.
- I see.

818
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:03,800
Bye, see you later.

819
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,120
See you soon, sister.

820
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,320
What was she saying?

821
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,160
We've to do a job for them?

822
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,360
- Will we get paid.
- Of course.

823
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,480
You're ruining the business.

824
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:18,680
What did you say?

825
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,640
I said you're ruining the business.

826
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,560
Look at me. Look at me.

827
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,520
Are you in love?

828
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:31,040
Don't be foolish.
I said don't be foolish..

829
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:33,320
Listen..

830
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,040
Let me know if you get tired.

831
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:43,960
I'll drive.

832
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:45,800
Can you drive a truck?

833
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:46,800
No.

834
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,480
But it's not a big deal.

835
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,200
Can you read and write?

836
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,840
The entire educated lot are jobless.

837
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,120
Even you are educated.

838
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,800
But who did you need in the end?

839
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:09,320
Who?

840
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,000
Drive slowly!

841
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,680
Stop. Stop.

842
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,080
Stop!

843
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:28,920
What's in the back?

844
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:29,760
Booze.

845
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,040
And who is the female?

846
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:34,680
She's my wife? Why?

847
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,480
I don't want your wife.

848
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:39,640
Shell out some bottle. Pay tax.

849
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:42,640
Come out.

850
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:45,240
Wait. You don't take the trouble.
Allow me.

851
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,120
- Why?
- I'll give you. Wait.

852
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:53,640
What's this red thing?

853
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:55,280
Is the battle broken?

854
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,960
Take the ones from there.

855
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,800
He's a friend.
We're taking him to the hospital.

856
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,240
- What happened?
- The outfits here, sir!

857
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,000
The outfits here, sir!

858
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,120
Get down.

859
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:16,600
Who is she?

860
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:17,760
She is his wife, sir.

861
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:18,560
Doesn't look like it.

862
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,320
Come on, hurry up.

863
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,680
Come on. Shut up.

864
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,840
We're rotting in the
jungle because of you.

865
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,960
It's been 10-months
since I last saw my wife.

866
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,720
Tell me..

867
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,800
Tell me where is your gang.

868
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,760
I am missing my wife.

869
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:46,680
Otherwise..I might get
too friendly with you.

870
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,680
Why you..

871
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:12,960
Come on, hurry up.

872
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:35,920
- You can drive a truck.
- No.

873
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,520
It's easy as driving a car.

874
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,360
You're educated. You'll manage.

875
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:45,880
The keys are under
the steering wheel.

876
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:47,400
Come on, get out of here.

877
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,920
- Go.
- Stop the truck.

878
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:55,720
Go.

879
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:03,960
Stop ass***

880
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,600
Stop the truck.

881
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,040
Arvind. Shut up.

882
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:20,920
Or else we'll crash.

883
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,760
Calm down. Calm down.

884
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,000
Does he know he'll lose his leg?

885
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,080
Yes, he does.

886
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:47,200
Come on.

887
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,400
Come on.

888
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,200
Does your family know what you do?

889
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:19,960
What do I do?

890
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,600
They don't know.

891
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,280
They have a hint,
but not too assured.

892
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,000
When did you last go home?

893
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,480
Last..

894
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:34,240
on Holi.

895
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,120
Six months ago.

896
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,960
Then call them now.

897
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,480
If I call they will know where I am.

898
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,480
I call them whenever I am in Delhi.

899
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:48,120
What do you say to your father?

900
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,600
Hello, papa. How are you?

901
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,400
How is your health?

902
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:59,520
How is mama?

903
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,680
What are you up to these days?

904
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:01,440
Not like this.

905
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,240
He's got a strong voice.

906
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:05,400
What have you been up to these days?

907
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,400
I hope you're not using
your brains in Politics.

908
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:10,880
No, papa. I go to watch
a movie every other day.

909
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:14,040
Yesterday I saw Amol
Palekar's Chitchor.

910
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,800
It's a very good film, papa.

911
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,160
Who did you go with?

912
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:17,880
What?

913
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,360
To the movies?

914
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,920
Did you along or with your friends?

915
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,680
With my friends.

916
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,640
What kind of friends do you
have who take you to the movies..

917
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,640
..and don't let you study?

918
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,280
I have a couple of them.

919
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,600
I want to introduce
one of them to you.

920
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,240
He's very nice.

921
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,360
I want to marry him.

922
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,760
He's doing an MA
in Political Science.

923
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:50,560
The outfit attacked a police
post in the jungle of Murphy..

924
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,360
..and seriously injured
two police officers.

925
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:56,800
Sub-Inspector Shulka who was
present at the scene told us..

926
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,440
..that almost 20 outfit
members attacked him.

927
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:00,320
What?

928
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:03,560
They fought gallantly..

929
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:04,920
We had to run.

930
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:06,680
I was joking.

931
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,280
Prime Minister Morarji
Desai believes that..

932
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,200
..the country's administration needs
a nudge in a positive direction.

933
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:14,840
He commented on the previous
government undertakings.

934
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:22,120
"You burn like the flame
and I flow like the wave."

935
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:28,320
"You're my refuge, I'm always with you."

936
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:34,840
"Always with you.."

937
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,400
"No one discloses this secret."

938
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,760
"No one brings any
information about you."

939
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,360
"Love is like poison."

940
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:50,640
"This poison attracts me."

941
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:21,120
"The abode of your arms.."

942
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:28,480
"..there's no place else I would go."

943
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:35,480
"I am the shore, and you're my ocean."

944
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:40,880
"Without you I don't exist."

945
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:48,840
"I am awake..I've been awake for ages."

946
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:55,880
"Come and calm me for a moment."

947
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:01,880
"For a moment.."

948
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:05,800
"No one discloses this secret."

949
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,080
"No one brings any
information about you."

950
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:12,840
"Love is like poison."

951
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:16,320
"This poison attracts me."

952
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:19,520
"No one discloses this secret."

953
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,320
"No one brings any
information about you."

954
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:26,800
"Love is like poison."

955
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:31,520
"This poison attracts me."

956
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,600
Rizwan, let's go.

957
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:40,560
No.

958
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:41,920
Can I keep it here?

959
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,760
Turn around, sweetheart.

960
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,000
Look.

961
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:47,600
What is this?

962
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:50,920
It's a dress. Can't you see?

963
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:57,120
A gift for my sister-in-law.

964
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,560
Why will you give her a gift?

965
01:13:58,720 --> 01:13:59,360
Why?

966
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,320
She's my sister-in-law.
Why can't I give her a gift?

967
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:04,320
I've heard many stories about
sister-in-law and brother-in-law.

968
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:05,640
She's your sister.

969
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:06,840
And you're my brother-in-law

970
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:07,640
Understood.

971
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,240
Did you hear, Bahadur?

972
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:15,200
Just because I bought her a gift
you lost all confidence and faith.

973
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,080
Yes, I did.

974
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,560
You cannot be trusted
for many things.

975
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:25,600
Did you check it?

976
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,160
That's a cheap thing to say.

977
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,960
Finally, you said what
was in your heart.

978
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:31,960
If there's anything else
you got to say then do it now.

979
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:33,280
I am not coming with you guys.

980
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,520
I won't give her this dress.

981
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:35,960
I'll set it on fire.

982
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,400
Go on and celebrate
your girlfriend's birthday.

983
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,200
What happened? Why are you crying?

984
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:43,280
Are you blind?
Do I look like I am crying?

985
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,640
Bloody dog.

986
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,080
What happened, Mitwa?

987
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:47,800
I will break your arm.
I will break your arm.

988
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:48,920
What happened?

989
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,720
Nothing, he's just being dramatic.
Come on.

990
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,000
You hurt me.
Loverboy..

991
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,880
Go on..celebrate her
birthday with these losers.

992
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:59,200
How dare you doubt me.

993
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,120
You bloody snake.

994
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,760
- I won't go with you.
- Fine, then don't.

995
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,680
Come on, last warning.

996
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,960
Get some sleep. We'll return soon.

997
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,880
Come on. Come.

998
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,240
Look at his face.

999
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:15,360
What happened?

1000
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:17,320
- What happened, son?
- Come on.

1001
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:23,960
And now you'll have to toil for life.

1002
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:26,120
Your men, your children.

1003
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:29,840
But if you study then these
landlords won't take away your land..

1004
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,080
..nor will these godmen
try to sell you god.

1005
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:39,520
They are our friends.

1006
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,040
Hello. Hello.

1007
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,680
Tonight we're going
to have a feast together.

1008
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:57,160
Happy birthday.

1009
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:01,920
Is this for me?

1010
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:02,440
Yes.

1011
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:04,280
Of course.

1012
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:05,440
Okay.

1013
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:14,000
I want to tell you something, Sukanya.

1014
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:19,720
This guy doubts us.. I mean me.

1015
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,000
There's something between us.

1016
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:26,440
He's right.

1017
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:31,160
I didn't go to Delhi when you two met.

1018
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:36,840
Otherwise today our relationship
would've been different.

1019
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,280
Right.

1020
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:40,560
Where are you going?

1021
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:41,800
I should leave.

1022
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,160
What happened?

1023
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:45,440
The consignment hasn't
reached Mirzapur yet.

1024
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:46,680
Forget it. Take care of it later.

1025
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:47,440
Don't worry.

1026
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:48,680
I should leave.

1027
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:49,320
Go on.

1028
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,800
Once again..congratulations.

1029
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:54,880
Rizwan, see you.

1030
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:02,520
[regional language song]

1031
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:06,040
[regional language song]

1032
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:09,000
Listen! Listen!

1033
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:12,240
The Police have surrounded the
village along with their men as well.

1034
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,160
Everyone go back to your homes.

1035
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:16,360
Vacate this place. Now.
Everyone leave.

1036
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,320
- Take care.
- Phagun.

1037
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,520
Come on, get out of here.

1038
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:23,040
Get out of here.
Hurry up.

1039
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,720
Get out of here.

1040
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,160
Open the door. Open the door.

1041
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:41,320
Attention Villagers, everyone
go back to your homes and lock the door.

1042
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,760
Because the outfit has
infiltrated your village.

1043
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:47,400
If anyone ventures out he'll be shot.

1044
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:49,280
Don't spare a single outfit member.

1045
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:15,080
Let's go this way.

1046
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:16,360
Keep the gun inside.

1047
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,480
Let's go this way. It's a straight road.

1048
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:31,000
Bullets?

1049
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:32,840
I am out of it.

1050
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,280
Rizwan.

1051
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,000
Sir, wait.

1052
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:07,280
Sir, let's leave some
people alive for interrogation.

1053
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:08,800
Sir, please.

1054
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,040
Move back. Back.

1055
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,040
All members of the outfit.

1056
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:21,200
We're doing our job.

1057
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:39,680
Look, we know you are not one of them.

1058
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:41,920
You guys are from this area.

1059
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,720
Bootleggers.

1060
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:48,120
Smuggle people to Nepal..

1061
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:50,720
..and give them
safe passage from Nepal.

1062
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,480
Since when did you start
supporting the outfit.

1063
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,360
What were you doing
in the village last night?

1064
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:05,840
Like I said sir,
we came here to sell booze.

1065
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:14,040
Where did you get these arms?

1066
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,560
You supply arms to
the outfit, don't you?

1067
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:26,160
No. No.. leave me.

1068
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,320
What is your leader's name?

1069
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,200
You fight other's battle.

1070
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:47,920
Jai Hind.

1071
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:49,080
Jai Hind.

1072
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:55,280
Jai Hind, sir.

1073
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:56,600
You called, sir.

1074
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,160
We've got almost all the names.

1075
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:04,560
Get to work.

1076
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:06,640
No need to show them mercy.

1077
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:57,880
Phagun.

1078
01:21:58,360 --> 01:21:59,800
Phagun, you're here.

1079
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,160
Mitwa.

1080
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:03,560
Fakeera.

1081
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:07,000
Fakeera escaped.

1082
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:08,920
He betrayed us.

1083
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,920
He must have called the Police.

1084
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,640
The traitor fled.

1085
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:14,760
Where is Sukanya?

1086
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,280
We're all going to die.

1087
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:18,440
What are you saying?

1088
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,320
Telling you where your mother's hiding.

1089
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:23,400
Don't just stand there. Shoot me.

1090
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:32,640
No, sir. He hasn't done anything.

1091
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:33,440
No!

1092
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:45,320
The Chaukdi Gang that dealt in
smuggling, bootlegging and illegal arms.

1093
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,240
..also supplied arms to the outfit.

1094
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:50,000
Looking at the long list of
their crimes, the court sentences..

1095
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:52,760
..Rizwan Sheikh to seven years.

1096
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:58,320
Bhimsen Thapa aka
Bahadur to seven years.

1097
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:05,440
Mitwa aka Mubarak Sehri to four years.

1098
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:17,200
And Phagun Gadoliya
to 10 years of imprisonment.

1099
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:31,400
No. 108, 305, 271, 464,
514, 314..come to the gate.

1100
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:40,680
Greetings, Phagun bhai.

1101
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:44,360
Uncle, that way.

1102
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:46,560
Back..

1103
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,720
Keep your hands away, 314.

1104
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,400
That way..come on.

1105
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,800
It took you an entire year to come here.

1106
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:09,920
I..

1107
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,320
It's difficult to step out of the house.

1108
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,480
Suddenly such love for your home.

1109
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,160
Earlier you went home only on Holi.

1110
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,400
I returned home but..

1111
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:26,680
..I didn't celebrate Holi this year..

1112
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,720
Mitwa, Rizwan..

1113
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:36,120
I heard that Mitwa is in Patna Jail.

1114
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,440
I often get news about
Bahadur and Rizwan.

1115
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,960
One is in Ranchi and
the others in Hajipur.

1116
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:43,560
It's a good thing you escaped.

1117
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:52,160
Don't you want to know how I escaped?

1118
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,760
I must have used my
father's connections and..

1119
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:56,800
Listen..

1120
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,840
I am happy you escaped.

1121
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,680
I don't care how.

1122
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,080
You had set out to change the world.

1123
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:08,520
So what happened now?
Did you get scared?

1124
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,040
So scared that it took
you a year to come here.

1125
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:14,120
Your revolution was a love story.

1126
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,360
But our story was a reality.

1127
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:18,160
At least for me.

1128
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:22,840
Phagun..

1129
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:28,480
Phagun, it took me a year
to set foot outside the house.

1130
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:32,440
And when I did this
is the first place I came.

1131
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,240
I wanted to tell you something.

1132
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:43,640
Come on.

1133
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:45,280
Shut up.

1134
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:54,400
You were roaming around with outfit.

1135
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,400
Shut up.

1136
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:00,040
Shut your mouth.

1137
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:01,160
Shut up!

1138
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,640
Sir.

1139
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:14,920
Sir.

1140
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,000
My name is NK Verma.

1141
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:31,880
Magistrate Nand Kishore Verma.

1142
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:35,800
Your father called up the CM.

1143
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:40,880
That's why I am here
and we're releasing you.

1144
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:42,360
This is a good thing.

1145
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:46,640
But a girl of your stature
indulging in these things..

1146
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,360
Does it suit you?

1147
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:51,680
You should be an IAS.

1148
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:57,560
Leave.

1149
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,240
Close that door.

1150
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:00,520
Close it.

1151
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:03,000
You too..leave.

1152
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:12,480
What happened?

1153
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:16,120
We have much evidence against you.

1154
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:18,600
We can reopen this case any day we want.

1155
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:23,480
Just..don't tell your family. Okay.

1156
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:26,760
- No, no..no!
-Shut up! Shut up!

1157
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:34,280
So I've been punished as well.

1158
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:38,360
And I've to bear this
for an entire lifetime.

1159
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:48,000
Madam, only five more minutes.

1160
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,120
Whatever you have for him,
deposit it here.

1161
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,160
Phagun..

1162
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:55,480
I've only five more minutes.

1163
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:58,440
Let me take a good look at you.

1164
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:08,200
I won't take too long now.

1165
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:11,880
Can.. I come back?

1166
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,000
With a smile.

1167
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:19,000
Happy.

1168
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:23,960
It should look like you're
still in love with me.

1169
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:32,280
You're in jail but you
shouldn't look like a prisoner.

1170
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,880
Madam, your five minutes are up.

1171
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:58,720
"Lost in your love.."

1172
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,480
"The effort of your love.."

1173
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,120
"Lost in your love.."

1174
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:05,560
"The effort of your love.."

1175
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:08,440
"Sweetheart.."

1176
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:17,760
"We'll meet like the spring of love.."

1177
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:23,480
"..every time like
it's our first time."

1178
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:31,920
"We'll sit together
forever holding hands.."

1179
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:38,800
"..and never take my eyes off you."

1180
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:42,440
"Whenever my eyes wander.."

1181
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:46,080
"..be the one to tether me."

1182
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:52,480
"And weave a new beautiful dream."

1183
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,440
"Lost in your love.."

1184
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:56,960
"The effort of your love.."

1185
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:58,600
"Lost in your love.."

1186
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,560
"The effort of your love.."

1187
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:02,360
"Lost in your love.."

1188
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:05,520
"The effort of your love.."

1189
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:08,320
"Sweetheart.."

1190
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:32,040
"Your company is like
a beautiful fragrance.."

1191
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:35,680
"Even your mention is alluring."

1192
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:41,400
"Every word is like a prayer."

1193
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:49,880
"Even if I find God,
and bestows me, Heaven.."

1194
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:55,240
"..I will choose you."

1195
01:30:55,320 --> 01:31:02,280
"We'll sit together
forever holding hands.."

1196
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:09,120
"..and never take my eyes off you."

1197
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:12,880
"Whenever my eyes wander.."

1198
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,480
"..be the one to tether me."

1199
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:23,400
"And weave a new beautiful dream."

1200
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:25,760
"Lost in your love.."

1201
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,360
"The effort of your love.."

1202
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:29,120
"Lost in your love.."

1203
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:31,400
"The effort of your love.."

1204
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:35,080
"Sweetheart.."

1205
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:57,360
Don't stress out your
eyes if you can't read.

1206
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,120
Bahadur.

1207
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,200
And my Amitabh Bachchan.

1208
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:03,360
How?

1209
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:04,840
I look smarter than before.

1210
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Too smart actually.

1211
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:07,680
You look strong.

1212
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:10,960
- I guess you got quite a beating in jai
- Come, let's sit.

1213
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:14,360
How did you like it?

1214
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,680
When happiness knocks
uninvited it's even better.

1215
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:22,400
Sukanya found us and then..

1216
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:23,560
- Sukanya.
- Yeah.

1217
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:24,560
Please.

1218
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:28,680
Any news about Fakeera.

1219
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:31,240
There's no news about that rascal.

1220
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,280
He must have been rewarded
handsomely for the betrayal.

1221
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:35,480
And set off to someplace else.

1222
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,560
Mitwa.. Where is Mitwa?

1223
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:40,320
I heard he lives somewhere
in Bombay or Dubai.

1224
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:42,160
Works for some guy called Shakeel.

1225
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:43,080
What job?

1226
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,640
Same job..smuggling.

1227
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:47,720
By the way, he's got a 2-year-old son.

1228
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:49,160
- Are you serious?
- Right here in Delhi.

1229
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:52,360
He got his girlfriend
pregnant and ran away.

1230
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:58,440
No, Mitwa can never do such a thing.

1231
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:00,280
I don't know, but this has happened.

1232
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,920
So she married someone
else and the kid's fine too.

1233
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,160
Listen, let's go out.

1234
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:13,680
Is our money safe?

1235
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,080
Yes, it's safe. We also have a plan.

1236
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:17,720
Bahadur.

1237
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:19,080
Listen..

1238
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:20,720
Gold.

1239
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:23,200
The game hasn't changed.

1240
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:26,200
We did it 10-years ago
what people are doing now.

1241
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:27,640
No..

1242
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:29,680
we won't do this job anymore.

1243
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:31,920
We'll buy up land around Delhi.

1244
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,840
And what are we going to
do on those lands? Build a farm?

1245
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,920
Build homes on those jobs.

1246
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:40,000
We'll do the same old job respectfully.

1247
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:50,280
"There's a waterfall of
fragrance..beyond the moon."

1248
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:55,000
"That's where we'll build our abode."

1249
01:33:57,240 --> 01:34:04,400
"Every word you
say..enchants my heart."

1250
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:09,760
"Towards a happy ending, we tread."

1251
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:16,800
"We'll sit together
forever holding hands.."

1252
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:23,760
"..and never take my eyes off you."

1253
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:27,400
"Whenever my eyes wander.."

1254
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:30,960
"..be the one to tether me."

1255
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:37,480
"And weave a new beautiful dream."

1256
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:40,200
"Lost in your love.."

1257
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:41,840
"The effort of your love.."

1258
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:43,760
"Lost in your love.."

1259
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,520
"The effort of your love.."

1260
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:47,320
"Lost in your love.."

1261
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,920
"The effort of your love.."

1262
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:52,800
"Sweetheart.."

1263
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:01,480
They sent an effigy at home
with a message written in blood.

1264
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:05,480
They want to tell us that
they can kill us in our homes.

1265
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:10,040
Tinku and Tanu are alone.

1266
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:11,720
Bahadur.

1267
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:14,400
Keep Tanu in your home for a few days.

1268
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:15,840
Okay.

1269
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:22,560
It's going to break someday.

1270
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:25,680
You can stay in this room. It's big.

1271
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,480
It's will be perfect for Tinku and you.

1272
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:31,280
Tinku, go play on the terrace.

1273
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:33,000
You might break something.

1274
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:36,280
Tinku.

1275
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:43,800
I'm emptying this cupboard.

1276
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:45,240
You two can keep your clothes here.

1277
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:47,840
Where is Madam?

1278
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:52,400
He's dead, isn't he?

1279
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:54,280
Yes.

1280
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:55,560
And that's why you brought us here.

1281
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,760
Because our lives are in danger.

1282
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:02,560
And I am sure you must wish
a couple of times that he was dead.

1283
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:18,400
What am I going to tell, Tinku?

1284
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:24,880
Tell him that he left you.

1285
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:28,520
Tinku must have dropped something.

1286
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:46,720
He hasn't said a
word since we found him.

1287
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:50,080
All he could say that
there were four men.

1288
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:55,920
Mr. Paramveer, this is Shakeel's doing.

1289
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:59,960
Because he believes
that you guys have Mitwa.

1290
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,840
And so do we.

1291
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:55,520
Tinku's going to stay here.

1292
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:58,000
You like kids, don't you?

1293
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:00,560
Who doesn't like kids?

1294
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,240
You lost one friend to save another one.

1295
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:11,080
Now you'll lose another one.

1296
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:13,720
- And then..
- What do you want?

1297
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:16,400
Do you want me to handover
Mitwa to them and say kill him?

1298
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:07,000
This is all my fault.

1299
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:10,920
All of it.

1300
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,320
But the point is, Mitwa.

1301
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,480
We must find Shakeel.

1302
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:18,760
All our lives are in danger.

1303
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:25,160
But the guy who killed
Bahadur will die first.

1304
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:28,560
I have his Dubai number.

1305
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:31,200
Yes, boss.

1306
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:32,800
Paramveer called.

1307
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:34,080
He's handing over Mitwa to us.

1308
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:35,280
Are you serious?

1309
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:37,200
- He's handing him over to us.
- Five minutes ago.

1310
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:40,200
So we killed one
and the rest got scared.

1311
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:41,800
Be ready.
They are calling us tomorrow morning.

1312
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:43,280
Of course.

1313
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:46,240
Tell them to bring him at Mehroli,
under Qutub Minar and drop Mitwa there.

1314
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:49,560
Will Paramveer come along
or bring Rizwan along too.

1315
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:50,840
Let's see.

1316
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:52,560
We should find a permanent
solution for them as well.

1317
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:53,680
- Of course.
- Okay.

1318
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:55,920
Hey..

1319
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:58,440
So Mitwa..

1320
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,200
..you will hide in the car's boot.

1321
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:03,680
They will see us and come out..

1322
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,040
They will see us and come out..

1323
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:15,560
But we don't recognise Shakeel.

1324
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:18,840
But if Shakeel comes out..

1325
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:26,120
But if Shakeel comes
out and you see him..

1326
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:29,480
..then make a knocking
sound from inside the car.

1327
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:33,800
We'll open fire.

1328
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:38,040
We'll handle the rest later..

1329
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:46,920
When I disconnected your call twice,
then you should know that..

1330
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:50,000
What?

1331
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:54,360
Listen to me, Suraiyya.

1332
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:58,400
It'll take me an hour to get there.
Don't let him leave.

1333
01:41:58,560 --> 01:41:59,640
He's asleep.

1334
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:03,000
Suraiyya, sweetheart.
Don't let him leave.

1335
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:08,120
Rizwan, I love you so much.
You will never know.

1336
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:10,800
Yes, yes, now hang up. I love you.

1337
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:04,640
What the..

1338
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:07,440
What is this?

1339
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:09,000
Where is Shakeel?

1340
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:11,120
Shakeel who?

1341
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:12,520
The guy who's looking for me.

1342
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:14,680
What are you looking for?
It's not there.

1343
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:17,880
Here's your..

1344
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:20,240
Goodbye, Rizwan sir.

1345
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,160
Goodbye.

1346
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,400
Thank you.

1347
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:26,080
Now leave.

1348
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:31,680
Now, do you understand?

1349
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:32,600
Tell us..

1350
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:34,840
Speak up.

1351
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:40,040
He's eating kebabs at
Bade Miya's in Nizamuddin.

1352
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,320
At Bade Miyan's.

1353
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,000
Do you know Nizamuddin?

1354
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:49,480
It's near the Afzal..

1355
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:51,000
The one near Mehtaab's chair shop.

1356
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:52,360
No, you've gone too far ahead.

1357
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:55,600
You go this way after the big mosque..

1358
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:58,280
It's a famous place.
There are boards everywhere.

1359
01:43:58,640 --> 01:43:59,520
Honestly..

1360
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:01,600
Come on, dress up. Come on.

1361
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:02,880
Get up.

1362
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:05,160
I am full..come on.

1363
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:06,480
Eat. Eat.

1364
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:08,680
Eat.

1365
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:10,160
That's it.

1366
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:19,720
Goodbye, Shakeel sir.

1367
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:45,800
He's coming at 6:30
behind the Qutub Minar.

1368
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:47,840
I'll call you at 6:35.

1369
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,360
What's that noise?

1370
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:54,200
Stop the car. Stop the car.

1371
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:56,160
Open the boot.

1372
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:57,480
Hurry up.

1373
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
He's our guy.
Help him up.

1374
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:06,520
Take his gag out.

1375
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:08,720
- How did you get here?
- Mitwa came to me..

1376
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:10,760
- How can he come now?
- He put a gun to my head..

1377
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:13,800
- Suraiya called him..
- Why do I smell petrol?

1378
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:15,040
Why do I smell petrol..

1379
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:28,480
How soon can you arrange
for me to leave this country?

1380
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,560
After this job, the Police
will keep a sharp lookout on us.

1381
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:34,320
Wait for few more days.

1382
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:39,080
Sir.

1383
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:41,200
Sir.

1384
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:43,600
That man asked me to wake you up.

1385
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:53,400
I guess you were very busy last night.

1386
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:55,800
What?

1387
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:58,680
That's why you passed out
after one drink on the couch.

1388
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:04,000
We found bodies of
Shakeel and his three men.

1389
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:06,120
Lying on the road.

1390
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:08,120
Their car was burnt.

1391
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:11,280
That's a good thing.

1392
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:15,320
Shakeel was a headache for you.

1393
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,360
That's why I came over to say thank you.

1394
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:20,840
You did a favour to society.

1395
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,880
Now handover Mitwa to us.

1396
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:28,040
Meaning you don't want to work at all.

1397
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:33,200
If Mitwa escaped then it must
have been his friends who helped him.

1398
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:41,480
Daljeet sir, I made a lot of
money and that's what I like to do.

1399
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:45,320
If I wanted to help him
then I would've bribed you.

1400
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:50,320
Enough to make a retirement
plan for your entire family.

1401
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:51,920
But I didn't..

1402
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:53,200
Imagine..

1403
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:58,280
..if I can't spend
money to save my friend..

1404
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:00,920
..you think I'll risk my life for him.

1405
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,120
Look Paramveer, leader of Chaukdi Gang.

1406
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,880
I don't want your character certificate.

1407
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:08,040
I want Mitwa.

1408
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:11,040
I asking you nicely.

1409
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:16,640
Otherwise, I'll arrest you the
day you try to smuggle him out of India.

1410
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:20,080
And not just you,
I'll drag your entire family.

1411
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:21,120
Enough.

1412
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:23,720
Know your limit, Daljeet.

1413
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,200
I heard everything
you said about me, Daljeet.

1414
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:29,720
You roughed me up and I said nothing.

1415
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:32,480
But don't say a word about my family.

1416
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:36,200
Otherwise, I'll be forced
to be my old self.

1417
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:41,440
And that me doesn't hesitate to kill.

1418
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:45,200
Now get it.

1419
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:01,480
Get that Sardar transferred.

1420
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:03,520
You can't get him
transferred in two days.

1421
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:10,280
Gulati's daughter's
wedding is two days later.

1422
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:14,000
You and Sukanya must go together.

1423
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,440
Some believe that you two are divorced.

1424
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:34,040
I know you didn't want to.

1425
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:36,120
But I am glad you came.

1426
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:39,480
People were starting to
believe that we have separated.

1427
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:42,880
Tinku finally spoke after three days.

1428
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:44,800
Thank God he did.

1429
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:46,040
What did he say?

1430
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:52,000
He said that some guy was talking
on the phone to a guy named Durani..

1431
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:55,120
..and he said the job's done.

1432
01:48:56,680 --> 01:48:57,920
Ramesh, turn the car around.

1433
01:48:58,120 --> 01:48:59,120
- Param..
-Turn it around. Turn it around.

1434
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:00,440
Param, what's going on?

1435
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:03,960
Bablu, tell the boys
not to move from the gate.

1436
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:05,080
We're coming back.

1437
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:07,680
I am sorry Sukanya.
But we're still in danger.

1438
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:09,760
Thank you.

1439
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:17,080
I've been calling you for so long.

1440
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:18,840
Why weren't you answering?

1441
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:22,960
Do you know Mr.
Grewal wasn't letting me come?

1442
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:25,040
I had to put up a big fight..

1443
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:29,120
Sonya, spend some time with Mr.
Grewal today.

1444
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:30,400
Please..

1445
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:35,880
I know..Bahadur is dead.

1446
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:39,520
I am really sorry.

1447
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:41,280
Seriously.

1448
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:42,200
Sonya.

1449
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:43,400
Sonya.

1450
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:45,200
Do you want me to leave?

1451
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:56,200
It's your mother calling.

1452
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Today you will talk only to me.

1453
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:07,760
I am not throwing away
my marriage for nothing.

1454
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:49,680
- Hello.
- Hello.

1455
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:51,600
Param sir.

1456
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:53,760
- Did Rizwan sir arrive?
- He's inside.

1457
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:18,280
Rizwan!

1458
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:20,600
Rizwan, come out. We need to talk.

1459
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:28,280
Someone shot Sonya ma'am.

1460
01:52:28,360 --> 01:52:29,400
- What?
- Come.

1461
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:34,240
Why didn't Sukanya come too?

1462
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:35,760
Hello.
I'll see you later.

1463
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:40,320
Sir..

1464
01:52:53,880 --> 01:52:54,640
Please..

1465
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:06,200
That bitch..she kept nagging
me as long as she was alive.

1466
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:08,160
And now even after she's
dead she has humiliated me.

1467
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:13,080
And that Rizwan,
I wanted to kill him myself.

1468
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:14,440
I wanted to kill him myself.

1469
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:17,640
What?

1470
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:19,320
Whose name did you take?

1471
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:20,480
You took Rizwan's name!

1472
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:21,840
You took Rizwan's name!

1473
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:24,200
I wanted to kill him myself.

1474
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:26,880
I will kill you. I will kill you.

1475
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:37,600
"Gathering the parts..in
which you were hiding."

1476
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:52,720
"Cajoling the moments..
that were yours."

1477
01:53:54,200 --> 01:54:00,600
"Those caravans are lost."

1478
01:54:00,760 --> 01:54:06,440
"You had said they will last forever."

1479
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:13,000
"Disappeared in thin air.."

1480
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:22,040
"You had said we'll
be together forever."

1481
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:31,320
Hello.

1482
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:33,560
I think someone else wants Mitwa.

1483
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:35,840
There's been a lot of bloodsheds.

1484
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:38,400
But not enough.

1485
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:58,240
Mr. Durani. Paramveer. From India.

1486
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:00,120
I am in your city.

1487
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:03,240
I wanted to meet you
and apologise personally.

1488
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:55,360
Sir..

1489
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:17,240
How are you, Phagun?

1490
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:18,480
Fakeera.

1491
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:21,560
Durani.

1492
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:25,920
We thought you were dead.

1493
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:28,760
Or we would've killed you long ago.

1494
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:31,280
- And we would..
- Still, be alive.

1495
01:56:34,760 --> 01:56:36,600
Mitwa is a petty thief.

1496
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:39,120
One should forget such friends.

1497
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:42,560
I saw him 15-years-ago in Dubai.

1498
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:44,240
He was in bad shape.

1499
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:47,120
I told Shakeel to give him a job.

1500
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:53,920
But he said that he never met you.

1501
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:55,000
He was right.

1502
01:56:55,320 --> 01:56:57,160
A lot of people work for me.

1503
01:56:58,400 --> 01:57:00,840
But I meet very few people.

1504
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:04,800
I don't want anyone to know who I was.

1505
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:09,880
When you guys got arrested
I ran for my life.

1506
01:57:11,120 --> 01:57:14,320
First to Nepal, then Russia.

1507
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:17,440
Carried out a few jobs,
made a name for myself.

1508
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:19,760
Became Durani.

1509
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:23,080
And this name gave me all the rewards.

1510
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:30,560
And that bloody Mitwa swindled 500
million from me and humiliated my name.

1511
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:38,520
You did the right thing, Phagun,
that you stopped protecting him.

1512
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:41,720
And the best part is you came to me.

1513
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:48,120
I am sorry about Rizwan
and Bahudur's death. Honestly.

1514
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:52,120
But as I said, it was never about money.

1515
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:55,480
My name was at stake.

1516
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,040
Now let's talk business.

1517
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:05,280
Airport.

1518
01:59:27,120 --> 01:59:28,520
Your job's done.

1519
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:31,440
Today evening at 6 o'clock
a car will take you to Agra Highway.

1520
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:33,800
From there you'll get in a truck..

1521
01:59:33,880 --> 01:59:35,440
- Won't you meet?
- No.

1522
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:38,960
If we meet I'll miss everyone.

1523
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:42,920
Everything was going
fine and then I came back.

1524
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:44,200
Yes..

1525
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:46,960
You shouldn't have returned.

1526
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:49,280
Well..

1527
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:51,720
..take care.

1528
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:53,640
You too.

1529
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:57,400
Just the two of us left now.

1530
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:08,000
Hello.

1531
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:09,400
Meet me at Lodhi Garden in one hour.

1532
02:00:43,640 --> 02:00:45,480
Your home is too far.

1533
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:48,400
That's why I called you here.

1534
02:00:50,720 --> 02:00:53,480
I wanted to show you something.

1535
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:12,280
That day you threatened me.

1536
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:15,400
I was so angry..

1537
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:18,960
I thought I'll arrest
you under some old case.

1538
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:22,920
I reopened the Chaukdi Gang file..

1539
02:01:24,640 --> 02:01:25,360
..and found this.

1540
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:30,120
Everyone thought that
Fakeera was the traitor.

1541
02:01:31,880 --> 02:01:34,200
But the real traitor was Mitwa.

1542
02:01:36,160 --> 02:01:38,920
Did you never think that you three
were sentenced to longer life terms..

1543
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:40,840
..and Mitwa got only four years.

1544
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:46,080
Give Mitwa to me, Phagun.

1545
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:49,000
And I will leave you alone.

1546
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:45,160
Mitwa.

1547
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:49,280
Phagun.

1548
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:52,120
You're here.

1549
02:02:52,360 --> 02:02:53,720
You did the right thing.

1550
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:01,240
I had to see you once.

1551
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:03,080
Even I did..

1552
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:07,400
We were together for so long
but I never took a good look at you..

1553
02:03:09,720 --> 02:03:11,400
..that this is how
a traitor looks like.

1554
02:03:19,880 --> 02:03:21,280
You gave everyone's name.

1555
02:03:23,200 --> 02:03:25,520
Do you know how many
youngsters lost their life?

1556
02:03:27,040 --> 02:03:28,800
Do you know what happened with Sukanya?

1557
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:32,680
Here..

1558
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:36,360
Passport and money.

1559
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,840
Take it and go.

1560
02:03:45,720 --> 02:03:46,960
Leave like a traitor.

1561
02:03:50,080 --> 02:03:53,120
Or just remorse over what you did.

1562
02:03:54,280 --> 02:03:56,800
Don't ruin the reputation
of Chaukdi Gang.

1563
02:04:08,440 --> 02:04:09,200
Phagun.

1564
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:26,480
Wait.

1565
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:50,520
"Befriending our dreams we treaded on."

1566
02:04:50,720 --> 02:04:52,360
No one dies.

1567
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:55,520
They fulfil their responsibilities
and go dwell in the skies.

1568
02:04:55,720 --> 02:05:05,800
"Weaving an abode with the
stars, we kept on weaving."

1569
02:05:09,120 --> 02:05:12,200
"The heart had no clue.."

1570
02:05:12,280 --> 02:05:20,880
"Controlling our heart
we kept on walking."

1571
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:27,440
"What is this heart, why is it here."

1572
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:34,360
"We kept it under close wraps."

1573
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:37,360
"Now it's shattered."
