1
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,080
Two students will now perForm
the last programme ofthe evening

2
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,880
Their height is... six feet.

3
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:03,400
They are ex-students
of this school.

4
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:08,880
My word, l haven't seen
such pranksters.

5
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,760
They were vey good friends.
And they are even now.

6
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,000
Their friendship bears a song.
Which they have composed themselves.

7
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,440
They have agreed to sing it
on my insistence.

8
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,720
l hope they find their rhythm.
l say this because...

9
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:37,720
one ofthem is a police inspector.
And the other a lawyer.

10
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:03,600
''Even if the world..turns an
enemy...

11
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:09,520
''Even if the world..turns an
enemy...

12
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:15,720
''may our friendship
always live on''

13

15
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:35,000
''May our friendship

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,520
''Even if the world..turns an

17
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:47,400
''May our friendship

18
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:27,680
''Those days of our dreams,
those days of our books...''

19
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,920
''those nights of questioning,
those days of answers''

20
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:41,600
''We have spent many years
here together...''

21
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:49,520
''it's here that we played together,
and grew up''

22
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,760
''Our childhood was
so vey romantic...''

23
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:02,400
''may our friendship

24
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,920
''Even ifthe world

25
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:14,080
''may our friendship

26
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:44,920
''Even in death,
we shall not separate...''

27
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:51,400
''this much we have sworn
to each other in our friendship''

28
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:57,360
''Whenever someone asks us
where we live...''

29
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:06,960
''we tell them that we live
in each other's hearts''

30
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,880
''We have no other abode...''

31
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,120
''may our friendship

32
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,080
''Even ifthe world

''may our friendship

34
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,520
''May our friendship
always live on''

35
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:42,840
''Even if the world..turns an

36
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:50,640
''May our friendship
always live on''

37
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,760
Has the gold arrived?
- Yes.

38
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,320
All right. When can we pick it
up?

39
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,920
Today itself.

40
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,920
l am floored!

41
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,720
Not exactly, Baby.
You're vanquished.

42
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,920
What about the money?
- Ask Tiwari.

43
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,720
He looks aRer the transactions
and accounts.

44
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:55,720
All right. But who will come
to pick it up?

45
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,120
Balwant.

46
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,120
At Malighat. Sharp 4 p.m.

47
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,520
ls that 533285?
- Yes.

48
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,520
l wish to speak to Inspector
Vijay Varma from the special branch.

49
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:24,120
Go on. l am
InspectorVerma speaking.

50
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,880
A gold consignment is arriving
at Malighat at 4 pm.

51
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,960
Who is receiving it?- You might
be knowing him. Balwant.

52
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,640
See you tomorrow evening.

53
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,640
Come in. The door is open.

54
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,320
Balwant's briefcase contained
500,OOO worth of gold.

55
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,360
100/o is your share. That is
50,OOO.

56
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,520
Here...
- Keep it there.

57
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,800
Won't you count it?
-You must have counted it.

58
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:07,560
Any news of Balwant?

59
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,960
He's hiding in East View lodge
in Kalina.

60
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,920
Tony, where do you get
this information from?

61
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,920
He'll vanish from Bombay for good
ifyou don't arrest him today,

62
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,520
Halt!

63
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,600
There's nothing to panic.

64
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:05,600
Bombay's highly reputed criminal
Iawyer will fight Balwant's case.

65
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,800
l got it, Mr Daaga.

66
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,000
Tomorrow is Sunday. He will be
bailed out on Monday.

67
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,480
Fine. But l think it's difficult
to free Balwant from this case.

68
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:26,120
What's the use of my fees
if l don't free your man?

69
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,320
Rest assured.
l'll be prepared for the case.

70
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:37,680
l hear, you and Inspector Vijay
are vey good friends.

71
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,960
Absolutely true.

72
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,960
Our friendship dates back to our
childhood. We studied together.

73
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:52,200
l was thinking ifyou could talk...
- No. No way, Mr Daaga.

74
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,880
Vijay is a police officer.
And l am a lawyer.

75
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,120
lt has happened many times
before.

76
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,280
He has arrested many criminals,
and l have freed them.

77
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:06,560
But our friendship still prevails
because he hasn't questioned me...

78
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:11,720
...about my profession. Nor l
have interFered in his work.

79
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,640
And...

80
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,720
Think ofthe devil, and here he
is!

81
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,840
We must leave.

82
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,160
Where were you all these days?
-Right here. Shall we play a set?

83
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:42,200
ARer them.-l have taken one
more case ofyours.

84
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,600
Balwant's. You arrested him.

85
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,680
You are on to it?
- Yes. Go ahead.

86
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,640
But his chances are grim.
- We'll see that in court.

87
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:57,400
Why did you take up this case?
-Come on! It's my profession.

88
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,520
You know he's a first rate
criminal. Still you...

89
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:07,280
lt's not for us to decide
if he is guilty or decent.

90
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,080
Let the court decided over it.

91
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,840
You won't improve.

92
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:18,320
My client Mr Balwant Singh
works for Roshan Electricals.

93
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:25,720
On the 15th he was on his way to
the bank to deposit 25,OOO in...

94
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:31,920
...the company's account. He had
a licensed revolver for security.

95
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:39,880
He had just got in a cab
and inspector Varma ascended.

96
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,960
He had a pistol in hand.

97
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:46,200
Your honour, Inspector Varma
was in muRi.

98
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:51,280
And you see, one's identification
is not inscribed on his face.

99
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:57,320
My client took him for a crook.
And he tried to escape.

100
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,520
Then Mr Vijay threatened
to shoot him.

101
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,760
To defend himself
Mr Balwant fired at him.

102
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,760
lt's not true.
It is baseless.

103
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,000
Because Mr Balwant vey well
knows me as a police officer.

104
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:20,200
This is not our first encounter.

105
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:24,320
On the 16th of October l tried
to arrest him at Malighat.

106
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,640
But he managed to escape.
- Wrong again.

107
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:38,680
On the 16th of October, Mr Balwant
was lying in the hospital...

108
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,000
...and not in Malighat.
He was ill and was bed-ridden.

109
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,840
This medical certificate...

110
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,160
...proves it.

111
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,880
''Me and you in a locked house''

112
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,680
''And the keys not to be found''

113
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,520
Hello!

114
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,680
lnspector, he...- What times! A
decent man like me...

115
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:49,840
..can't even walk on the streets!
- Inspector, the fact is...

116
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,720
What is the problem?

117
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,480
l was on my way to the beach
for a swim. He whistled at me...

118
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,520
...and passed remarks at me.
- Lies!

119
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:02,040
l am seriously stressed up myself!
You see it, don't you?

120
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:10,320
You proceed.
- Nothing else. l've said it all.

121
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,400
What happened?-Her complaint is
that he teased ...

122
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,480
...and whistled at her.
-l didn't!

123
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:29,360
Did you whistle?
- Actually...

124
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,400
Did you whistle, or not?
- Yes, l did. But not to her.

125
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:34,840
l swear.
- Then why?

126
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,480
l am a music buff. l like to
fiddle with instruments.

127
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,880
He also broke into a song
on seeing me. What was that?

128
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,160
''Me and you in a locked house''
''And...''

129
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,800
''And... the keys not to be found''

130
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:52,880
Constable...

131
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,880
Lock him up.
Tomorrow is court-day.

132
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,680
Make sure the keys
to the lock-up don't vanish.

133
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:14,400
You can file your complaint.

134
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:25,800
l would like to tell you
something.

135
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,360
Yes, tell me.

136
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:35,480
lt's our duty to arrest and teach
a lesson to such third class loafers.

137
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,840
And we do it. But, there are some
duties ofwomen too.

138
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,440
Like what? l don't get it.

139
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,120
Just look at yourself.

140
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,400
lfyou roam about
in these kind of dresses...

141
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,400
..do you think instead ofwhistles
you will hear the temple bell?

142
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,080
What's wrong with this dress?
- There is hardly any.

143
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,160
l've heard, ladies used to
fancy their dresses, longtime ago.

144
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,200
But nowadays, why have you ladies
become so stingy about it?

145
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,000
Now look, what l like to wear
is my personal matter.

146
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:17,600
l see. Just like the loafer's personal
matter was to whistle, right?

147
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:23,440
Any matter which troubles others
cannot be personal.

148
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,520
But how does this dress
trouble others?

149
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,160
This question suits the loafer
who whistled at you.

150
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:37,160
An_ay, you seem to be a decent
girl from a decent family.

151
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:41,560
lfyou put on some decent dress,
then l think it won't trouble anyone.

152
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,840
An_ay, it's your wish.

153
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,720
Sawant, take down her
complaint.

154
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,320
What's his name?

155
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,800
He just doesn't possess
any kind of etiquette.

156
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,960
My case is fixed on the 21th.
And the witness...

157
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:29,880
Don't talk about the court.
This is a pam. Have fun.

158
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:35,920
This is the first time
l see you on time. And...

159
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,960
Hello, Mr Sahney!

160
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,680
Have you met my daughter
Sheetal?

161
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:59,440
Hello- Sheetal, he is a
famous criminal lawyer.

162
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,600
Mr Sahney, please come with me.
- Hey, Mr Mehta!

163
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:10,200
l've read about your Nihar
murder case in the newspapers.

164
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:12,600
You were just incredible
and you won the case.

165
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:18,520
Really? Are you interested
in such things?

166
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,520
There are many such interesting
and sensational cases.

167
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,840
Now that we know each other,
l'll tell you about it in leisure.

168
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,600
What are you doing tomorrow
evening?

169
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,080
Nothing. Why do you ask?- l
have some work with your father.

170
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,880
A good reason to meet you too.

171
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,400
No place for reasons.
You can drop in at any time.

172
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,560
l must leave now, Miss Sheetal.

173
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,320
So early?- Even l have to work
for a living.

174
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,080
And this fool had to
drop in now, you see. Bye!

175
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,920
Sheetal, meet Vijay.
And she is my daughter Sheetal.

176
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:21,320
My dear, he is a daredevil
police officer.

177
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,400
l see? So, he is a police
officer?

178
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:29,200
l don't understand one thing, daddy.
The crime is on the rise day by day.

179
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,640
What does the police do about
it?

180
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,600
Mr Sahney, our police force
and the C.l.D...

181
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,320
...has set an example for the
world.

182
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,600
But, this fact is known only by
few educated people like you and me.

183
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:50,560
Fools and illiterate people
just ty to find flaws in it.

184
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,960
But we must not take them
seriously.

185
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:57,960
What do you think?
Am l not right, Miss Sheetal?

186
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,160
Perhaps.

187
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:03,200
But Daddy, if our police force
is so effective...

188
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:06,560
...then why doesn't crime cease?

189
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,600
Mr Sahney, if not cease,
crime can be reduced.

190
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,360
But the people must also
understand its responsibilities.

191
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,600
Suppose you leave your house
all open...

192
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,480
...won't it drive the thiefs
bad intentions on?

193
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:28,400
Ty telling this to people,
and they get furious.

194
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:30,400
Weird talks! You thinks people
ale...

195
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:34,120
Come on! Both ofyou have
really got deep into it.

196
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:39,640
Go ahead.
Throw your questions at me.

197
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:42,520
Else, how will you gain
knowledge on this subject.

198
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,680
Hey Vijay, you are here?
You are wanted there.

199
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,520
Me?-Eveyone is requesting you
to sing.

200
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,480
Are you kidding?

201
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,120
A song? From a police officer?
- You'll be amazed to hear him.

202
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,960
How will he sing in an orchestra?
He might need a police-band.

203
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:15,280
Come on! Don't hesitate.
- We are getting late.

204
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,680
''There was this extremely beautiful
young girl...''

205
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:49,080
''walking down the lane,
all alone''

206
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:56,480
''She wore clothes, only because
she had to dress in something''

207
00:27:56,599 --> 00:28:04,520
''She looked as exotic as the
sculptures ofthe Ajanta Ellora''

208
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:14,640
''And there came this young man
who bumped into her''

209
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,400
''You decide this, my friends...''

210
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:25,960
''whose mistake is it?
Whom are we to punish?''

211
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,600
''You decide this, my friends...''

212
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:37,360
''whose mistake is it?
Whom are we to punish?''

213
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:10,520
''That which happened,
could not have been averted''

214
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:17,720
''She had stepped out of her
house, dressed to kill''

215
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:28,680
''Had someone not eyed her,
it would have been his decency...''

216
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:36,720
''had he cast a glance, however,
nothing would escape his eyes''

217
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:50,320
''A love-lorn man got blamed
for nothing''

218
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,760
''You decide this, my friends...''

219
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:02,040
''whose mistake is it?
Whom are we to punish?''

220
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,560
''You decide this, my friends...''

221
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:12,680
''whose mistake is it?
Whom are we to punish?''

222
00:30:54,680 --> 00:31:06,280
''Those endowed with good looks,
have always been beautiful...''

223
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,000
''but they never stepped out
on the streets''

224
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,920
''They wore different clothes
too...''

225
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:26,480
''but they never adopted a new
fashion almost evey day''

226
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:36,360
''One fashion leaves,
and another takes over...''

227
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:42,200
''so decide this, my friends''

228
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:48,120
''Whose mistake is it?
Whom are we to punish?''

229
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:52,680
''You decide this, my friends...''

230
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:59,400
''whose mistake is it?
Whom are we to punish?''

231
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,600
Tomorrow the gold consignment
is arriving at l p.m...

232
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:36,360
...just 2 miles away from
Rethibunder.

233
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,560
lt's inspector Varma again!

234
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,360
This man has become a menace.

235
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:49,800
8 millions in gold
have been seized.

236
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,800
Add to it, l have lost mo men.

237
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:56,960
l wonder where he gets
this information from.

238
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:59,640
We must find that out, Daaga.
- How?

239
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,520
Should l ask an astrologer
regarding this?

240
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,320
But, Daaga...
- It's quite simple.

241
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:14,600
lfyou keep an eye on Vijay Varma,
and find out details about...

242
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:22,280
... people he meets, then it is
possible to identify his informer.

243
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,000
Did you read the news
about your friend?

244
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:31,080
He risked his life in a dangerous
chase and seized 8 millions in gold.

245
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,240
This kind of daredevily
is his forte.

246
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,680
My friend is a incredible
police officer!

247
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,040
He is an incredible police officer.
And you are a remarkable lawyer.

248
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,680
The only difference is that he
catches criminals... and l free them.

249
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,360
Doesn't any misunderstanding
arise bemeen you mo...

250
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:55,520
...friends on this regard?
-No way. No chance.

251
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:58,640
We don't mix our friendship
with our profession.

252
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,800
l can give my life for him.

253
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,200
lfyou mo are such friends,
please include me in your list too.

254
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
Who doesn't need a good friend?

255
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,120
Madam, l have written your name
in my list at first sight.

256
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:24,520
l must entertain you well.
How about one more coffee?

257
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,360
No, thanks.

258
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,320
l must say something. Our friendship
seems to be a one way traffic.

259
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,640
ARer that pam l have come
a dozen times over to your house.

260
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,960
But you haven't set your foot
in my humble home. Not even once.

261
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:43,080
There's nothing as such.

262
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:47,440
Someday l will certainly set my
foot at your celestial abode.

263
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,960
Thank you vey much!

264
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:56,160
l want to speak to Mr Vijay.

265
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,160
Speaking. Who is it?

266
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,480
Yes, Miss Sheetal?
What makes you remember me?

267
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:08,400
Did someone flirt with you
again?

268
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,520
No, nothing as such.

269
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:15,960
l read in the papers about your
chase with the smugglers.

270
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,000
Did you read it?
They have glorified you.

271
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:24,240
l thought of congratulating you.
And l called you up.

272
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,120
Oh l see. Now l get it.

273
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:38,400
l wondered why'd a pampered rich
girl phone a pem police officer.

274
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:42,320
But someone said it right,
that today's girls...

275
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,240
...are impressed by famous
people.

276
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:51,200
You must've already boasted to
eveyone that you know me vey well.

277
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:55,560
You must be getting
a lot of attention, don't you?

278
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:58,000
What? What do you think of
me?

279
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:03,640
My mistake to call you up!
What do you think ofyourself?

280
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,760
A pem police officer.

281
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,240
What's the matter?
You seem to be short-tempered.

282
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,960
You think you've earned
international fame...

283
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,520
...with a piece ofyour exploits
in the papers?

284
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:20,680
You think l called you because
l am impressed by your fame?

285
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,120
lfthis is not the reason...then
there is only one reason leR.

286
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,320
And that reason you and l know
vey well.

287
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,440
l'll definitely give it a thought.

288
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:34,800
Have seen yourself in the
mirror?

289
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,520
l am afraid... yes.
While shaving today morning.

290
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:44,960
Actually, my face is vey expressive.
Especially my eyes. They attract.

291
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:46,480
Simply great!

292
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:54,480
l deeply regret to have called you.
l won't make this mistake again!

293
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,640
A lady has come to see you.

294
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
All right, come

295
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:37,400
Didn't l say l'd drop in someday?
And here l am.

296
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:41,680
You did say.
But l never expected you.

297
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:44,640
l don't know how to welcome
you.

298
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,200
Anybody there?

299
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:48,960
Yes, sir?

300
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,040
What would you have?
Hot or cold?

301
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,080
Any cold drink.- Two cold
drinks.- l will bring now, sir.

302
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:00,520
How is your father?

303
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:09,000
ls that Mr Vijay's photograph?
- Yes.

304
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,800
He is my only friend. Which is why
l have kept his photograph.

305
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,000
But the walls in this room
are still empty.

306
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:19,240
Why don't you fill it up
with some good photographs?

307
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,200
Shall l ?

308
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:34,760
Yes, Mr Daaga? What's up?

309
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,640
Don't you wory.
What am l here for?

310
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,920
So what ifyour men are guilty
of murder? l am there to save them.

311
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,960
See this bungalow!
How beautiful it is!

312
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,520
You like it?

313
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,360
l haven't seen such a lovely
house in my life.

314
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,200
This is the world's
most beautiful house.

315
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:18,560
Feels like it is not on the ground,
but somewhere in the clouds.

316
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:21,440
l feel like...

317
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:34,640
Believe me, Mr Ravi, you won't find
a better building contractor...

318
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,160
...than myself in the whole of
Bombay.

319
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,200
All right. You go with my secretay
and check out my vacant plot at Juhu.

320
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:49,000
And build a house for me.
Exactly like this.

321
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,800
How long will it take to build it?
- Say around 6 months.

322
00:42:57,079 --> 00:43:00,440
Make it as soon as possible.
Don't wory about the money.

323
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:05,040
lfthat's the case, l'll show you
better designs than this.

324
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:07,800
l just want this design,
Mr. Malkhani.

325
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,400
Because this is the world's
most beautiful home.

326
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:21,280
Feels like it is not on the ground,
but somewhere in the clouds.

327
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:25,040
l get it, Mr Ravi.

328
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:37,120
You are strange! Where are you?
Can't even get to see you at the Gym.

329
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,600
Nothing as such.
- Who was he?

330
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,120
An architect.

331
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:44,840
Why? What for?

332
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,000
l am building a house.
- A house?

333
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,640
What's wrong with this?

334
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,520
l have travelled much. Now l
plan to mary and settle down.

335
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:07,040
Good idea. Have you seen any girl?
- No, l haven't yet. But l will.

336
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:10,640
l see. You hide from me?
Tell me, who is she?

337
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,640
Hey, there's nobody. Don't wory
about me, big daddy.

338
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:19,880
Find a good girl for yourself
and settle down.

339
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,960
l did like a girl.
Butthings didn'twork out.

340
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,800
Come on, you are good at it.
But l am no good.

341
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,360
l get a bit nervous.
- So what?

342
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,280
l'll speak for you.
- First, speak for yourself.

343
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:43,520
Sheetal, these flowers are rosy
in colour like you.

344
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,800
But you are looking more red
in your anger now.

345
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:02,360
Yes, l'm Vijay here.
l was waiting for your call.

346
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:07,120
Really? So, you were sure
l'd call you, were you?

347
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:09,800
Of course. l have seen
a lot of cases like this.

348
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,480
Tell me...
How are you?

349
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,520
May l ask you why you sent me
these flowers?

350
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:19,880
Just to get a call from you.

351
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,440
And just why did you expect
a call from me?

352
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,120
Just because l want to meet you.

353
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,920
And why so?

354
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,560
You see, Miss Sheetal,
there are many reasons for this.

355
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:36,840
lt so happened that...

356
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,840
ltjust crossed my mind that,
l thought you'd understand...

357
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,240
...what l understood. But you
couldn't understand it either.

358
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,960
And you thought l understood what you
were tying to make me understand.

359
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,120
This misunderstanding has created
a bit of confusion.

360
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:59,080
And ifyou see through, we are
stuck in a strange whirlwind.

361
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,040
Whirlwind! What whirlwind?
l don't get what you say.

362
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,800
Exactly. This is the confusion.

363
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:11,760
And to get out of it
we must meet rightaway.

364
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,880
And ifwe put our heads
together, Miss Sheetal...

365
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,960
...we can easily get out
ofthis confusion... gradually.

366
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:25,440
ARer that evemhing
will be all right.

367
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:27,120
And then...
it will be all bed of roses!

368
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,760
But this outcome won't come
byjust sitting at home.

369
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,320
We must meet, and keep meeting.

370
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,000
But l don't want to meet you.

371
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:42,200
Since when have you started
Iying?

372
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:46,120
An_ay, dump these odd talks.
They are unyielding.

373
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:50,080
l am free tomorrow. Why don't
we make it tomorrow then?

374
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:54,480
That's final. l'll see you
at Golden Chariot tomorrow.

375
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:59,720
l don't want to meet you.
-See you at 4 in the evening.

376
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:06,680
Keep waiting.
l won't come. No way.

377
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,680
l had said l wasn't coming.
Then why did you expect me?

378
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,440
Be seated.

379
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:49,520
Come on out with it. Quick.
l can't wait for long.

380
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:52,200
Right kind of mood
to have a cold drink.

381
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,800
What would you have?
Limca, thumsup, or orange...

382
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,640
You want to tell me something?
- Sory...?

383
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,000
Oh... yes, l want
to tell you something.

384
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,120
You see, Miss Sheetal, l want
to clear something with you.

385
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,520
So that there won't be any
misunderstanding in future.

386
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:19,880
lfyou think, l am just putting
on a show, but l love you vey much...

387
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,720
lfyou think so, then let me tell
you that you are right.

388
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,640
But... l never thought that...

389
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,720
Look Sheetal, don't tell me that
you don't like me or love me.

390
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,280
l am a police officer. l promptly
catch a person who tells a lie.

391
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:13,640
lf l am not wrong...
did you say you love me?

392
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:19,640
But you are behaving as ifyou
are giving me a speeding ticket.

393
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:22,480
Surely there are other ways too
to express your love?

394
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,400
lndeed. But they are worn out
and outdated.

395
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:32,360
So l thought l'd ty a new style.

396
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,920
To help me succeed.

397
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:40,080
Vijay, ifyou think you'll succeed
because ofthe novelty...

398
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:44,760
...then you are right.

399
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:29,440
''A sense of fun
fanned the fires...''

400
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:33,600
''there rose a bit of smoke,
and the flames leapt up''

401
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:46,880
''Our friendship has
blossomed into love''

402
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:50,240
''A sense of fun
fanned the fires...''

403
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:56,520
''there rose a bit of smoke,
and the flames leapt up''

404
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:09,760
''Our friendship has
blossomed into love''

405
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:46,440
''We rarely met earlier. Then we
saw so much of each other...''

406
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:52,320
''in that one meeting however,
in a light hearted moment...''

407
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:57,840
''l wonder what you said...''
''l wonder what l heard...''

408
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:03,640
''l wonder what you said...''
''l wonder what l heard...''

409
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,800
''you were only cracking a joke
and it almost killed me''

410
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:23,400
''Our friendship has
blossomed into love''

411
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:26,720
''A sense of fun
fanned the fires...''

412
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:32,760
''there rose a bit of smoke,
and the flames leapt up''

413
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:00,880
''ln the coming oftogether
ofmo hearts...''

414
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,280
''in the pla_ulness of our eyes...''

415
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:15,680
''my heart was pounding,
it could be heard far away''

416
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:20,480
''ls this killing to be forgiven?
Is this anyjustice?''

417
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:25,800
''lt was doing ofthe eyes and
it was the heart that was targetted''

418
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:39,640
''Our friendship has
blossomed into love''

419
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,520
''A sense of fun
fanned the fires...''

420
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:49,080
''there rose a bit of smoke,
and the flames leapt up''

421
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:24,760
''Our friendship has
blossomed into love''

422
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:28,400
''A sense of fun
fanned the fires...''

423
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:33,440
''there rose a bit of smoke,
and the flames leapt up''

424
00:54:33,559 --> 00:54:47,440
''Our friendship has
blossomed into love''

425
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,960
What brings you here?
- l came to buy some things.

426
00:55:44,199 --> 00:55:47,840
Their men are keeping a watch
on you. They are tailing you.

427
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:52,440
One ofthem is watching you
eVen nOW.

428
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,920
They want to know
who is your informer.

429
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,240
Any information?
- Yes.

430
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:06,040
At 4 pm today, near Bombay
Central...

431
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:15,040
...their man Prakash is delivering
one million in gold to someone.

432
00:56:15,159 --> 00:56:19,680
His car number is MRX 4060.

433
01:00:55,480 --> 01:01:01,120
Sylvia, he alone is poised to win
this year's derby.

434
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:22,040
l'm sory Mr Daaga, Prakash couldn't
deliver your gold to the right man.

435
01:01:22,159 --> 01:01:24,240
Prakash? Who Prakash?

436
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,720
l found your telephone number
and address on him.

437
01:01:37,719 --> 01:01:42,360
Are you talking about the Prakash
who fell to death from a train?

438
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:47,520
Yes, l remember. l read about
him in the newspapers.

439
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:50,120
l am delighted to hear
that you read newspapers.

440
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:54,280
But why did he keep my
telephone number and address?

441
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:01,080
He could have told you.
Your misfortune. He is dead.

442
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:06,240
The news of his death was a
false news spread by us to...

443
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:09,520
...cheat you. He isn't dead.
He's alive and kicking.

444
01:02:09,639 --> 01:02:10,920
He is alive?

445
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:13,680
And he has testified
in the hospital itself.

446
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,200
Don't you fret, Mr Daaga.
Prakash is dead.

447
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,200
l just wanted to see the change
in colour ofyour face.

448
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:32,280
These things are trivial, Inspector.
The court asks for evidence.

449
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,080
And as long as the police doesn't
find any evidence against us...

450
01:02:36,199 --> 01:02:38,120
...it can't even shake us.

451
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,680
Little mouths don't open
in front of elders. Understand?

452
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:48,600
lnspector Vijay,
you have insulted my man.

453
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:52,320
l can sue you for this
in Court.

454
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,640
Well, Mr Daaga, you will have to
produce evidence for this smack.

455
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,840
How can l help you in this
matter?

456
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,360
Vijay is a close friend ofyours.

457
01:03:09,239 --> 01:03:12,280
He is. But he is a responsible
police officer.

458
01:03:12,519 --> 01:03:14,680
l can't interFere in this matter.
And what do you think?

459
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,800
Will he let you go scot-free
if l tell him?

460
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:22,080
That l am his friend, doesn't mean
that l have bought him out.

461
01:03:24,039 --> 01:03:27,800
lfyou haven't done it yet,
do it now. l am with you.

462
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:28,600
Meaning?

463
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,720
Here's 1 ,OOO,OOO in this bag.

464
01:03:34,239 --> 01:03:36,080
Tell me ifyou think
the price is less.

465
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:40,120
There is no price for Vijay.
My friend is priceless.

466
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:43,120
You can't buy his honesty.
Not even for 10 million.

467
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,640
My friend is a man of principles.

468
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:02,680
Amazing! He is the first lawyer
l have seen in my life...

469
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,800
...whose hobby is to fly an
airplane.

470
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,120
Flying isn'tjust an hobby for Ravi.
It is his life's first romance.

471
01:04:11,239 --> 01:04:13,480
His first love.

472
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:20,080
Tell me something.
- Go ahead.

473
01:04:20,199 --> 01:04:23,040
Even you must have had
a first love, hadn't you?

474
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:27,480
Yes. l did have a girlfriend.
But why do you ask?

475
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:30,320
Just nothing.

476
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:38,480
Was she in your college?
-Oh yes. In college...in my class.

477
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,480
What was her name?

478
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:49,920
The name was... Meenakshi.
Meenakshi Chatterjee.

479
01:04:50,039 --> 01:04:53,200
Eveyone used to call her
her as Meena with love

480
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:56,560
Did you call her that too?
- No.

481
01:04:56,679 --> 01:05:00,800
ln college l was a shyster.
l was scared to talk to girls.

482
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:03,640
But this girl was vey...

483
01:05:05,559 --> 01:05:06,920
An_ay, forget it.
What use digging up the past?

484
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:09,560
Exactly. No use.

485
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:11,720
Was she beautiful?

486
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:15,800
Yes, she was nice.

487
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:20,880
Roundish face. Large eyes.
Long tresses.

488
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,160
Now that you mention her,
l think she was quite exotic.

489
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:35,880
And so you fell for her?
- Who, me? Forget it.

490
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,280
At the beginning l never
used to look at her.

491
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,880
But one day something
strange happened, and...

492
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,080
Forget it. Why dig up the past?
- Right. No use.

493
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,800
So you were saying...
what happened that day?

494
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:59,160
What day... yes, that day
...it so happened...

495
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:06,760
ARer college, l find only Meenakshi
standing at the bus-stop.

496
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:11,000
l didn't mind her. Like me she
must've come to catch a bus.

497
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,720
There was a silence.

498
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,160
All of sudden she.said, ''Excuse
me'

499
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:23,640
l said, yes please?

500
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,760
She said, ''My watch isn't working.
Could you tell me the time?''

501
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:31,560
l know. This is an outdated idea
to start a conversation.

502
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:34,360
Quite possible her watch
must have stopped working.

503
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,760
You are unnecessarily suspecting her.
- No need to advocate for her.

504
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:43,760
What happened next?- What
else? l told her the time.

505
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:49,480
Again there was a silence.
There was no sign ofthe bus.

506
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:54,880
l decided to walk. l had just
put a step ahead and she said...

507
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,800
''Listen''.
-l said, yes, tell me.

508
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:04,960
She said, ''You are leaving me
alone over here''

509
01:07:05,079 --> 01:07:09,320
''l am scared to be alone.
Can you drop me home?''

510
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:15,800
Why? Was the bus-stop in a forest?
-Not exactly. But she was afraid.

511
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:22,040
l told her to come along.
Then we started walking.

512
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:27,800
l felt like the poor thing
was a bit tired.

513
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:32,800
You know there are benches
on the footpath, don't you?

514
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,240
l told her to sit down for a few
moments. She sat down.

515
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:43,960
Then l saw that
she was staring at me.

516
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:47,240
l asked Meena whatthe matter
WaS.

517
01:07:48,599 --> 01:07:55,680
You know what she said? She said,
''Vijay are you cross with me?

518
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,680
l said, come on, why would
l be angy with you?

519
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,920
Why do you think like this,
Meena?

520
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:09,560
She said, ''Vijay, why do you
always remain far from me?

521
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,800
''You never even give me a look''

522
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:17,960
And then when l gave her a look,
do you know what l saw, Sheetal?

523
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:23,720
l saw mo large drops oftears
in her large eyes.

524
01:08:25,119 --> 01:08:30,200
That moment l realised that this girl
Ioves me from within her heart.

525
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,440
She considers me to be her god.

526
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,560
l said... Meena don't, l can't bear
to see tears in your eyes.

527
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:42,520
For my sake wipe it. Please!

528
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:45,000
Excuse me.
This isn't your Meena's arm.

529
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:47,360
lt's mine. And you don't
have to touch it.

530
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,720
Why are you furious?
- Why should l be?

531
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:56,280
lf l tell something about Meenakshi,
you will cool down at this moment.

532
01:08:56,399 --> 01:09:01,600
Never in my life have l come
across a girl named Meenakshi.

533
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,640
And this stoy...
l just concocted it. How is it?

534
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:17,400
Let's not fight.
Ravi is coming.

535
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,520
Hello, Ravi
-Hi, buddy!

536
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,840
What brings Sheetal here?
- Actually...

537
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,360
l came to see you. Just you.

538
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:41,440
That's vey kind ofyou. Or l
don't deserve such attention.

539
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,360
You are wrong, Mr Ravi.
Person like you...

540
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:48,680
...who respects others' sentiments
are rare to find nowadays.

541
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,720
Do you really mean it?
- Of course.

542
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:59,640
People lie unabashedly. Why must
l hesitate to tell the truth?

543
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,400
You are really a nice person.

544
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,600
l feel proud that
you consider me a friend.

545
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,560
The keys to your new house,
Mr Ravi.

546
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:30,480
Just take a look. You'll find it
an exact replica ofthat photograph.

547
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:47,440
Our new house. Do you like it?
Come in and take a look.

548
01:10:51,399 --> 01:10:52,320
Our drawing room.

549
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,520
lsn't it beautiful?

550
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:00,600
Tell me, do
you really like it?

551
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:04,520
This is nothing. Come inside.

552
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,040
The dining room.

553
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:16,080
What will you do with this big table?
- Come on. Won't l have a family?

554
01:11:16,199 --> 01:11:19,000
Let me show you the bedroom
upstairs.

555
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:25,440
Keep the bedroom for later.
Just lay it out straight.

556
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:27,400
l brought you here
to tell you just that.

557
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:29,680
Who is she?

558
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:41,280
Unbelievable, isn't it? Even
l can't bring myselfto believe it!

559
01:11:43,239 --> 01:11:46,560
But, maybe this was bound to
happen...it was bound to happen.

560
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:56,680
You know, life has bestowed me with
riches. But when it comes to love...

561
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:00,240
l've only your friendship
to fall back upon.

562
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:08,240
As you know, l've always been a
Ioner in my life.

563
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:15,160
Sheetal is a terrific girl!
She is...

564
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,160
Oh, what's happening to me?

565
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:27,080
lf she comes into my life, my life
will never be drab and dull again.

566
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:33,960
l wonder how this happened.
l wonder how!

567
01:12:34,199 --> 01:12:40,480
But, now l can't even think
of a life without her.

568
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:46,720
You must know this Vijay
...if l don't get married to her...

569
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:51,080
...you will lose your friend.

570
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:54,160
Life would be meaningless for
Me.

571
01:12:56,199 --> 01:13:01,600
You must do it, Vijay.
- What?

572
01:13:03,079 --> 01:13:05,960
You know l won't be able
to propose to her.

573
01:13:07,399 --> 01:13:13,040
lt'd be better ifyou put a word
on my behalf.

574
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:19,800
All right. You must do this
in a couple of days. Fine?

575
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:21,800
Come with me.

576
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:29,440
You are my true friend.

577
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:44,840
Yes?
- Is Sheetal there?

578
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,320
No, madam is not here.

579
01:13:46,439 --> 01:13:48,720
Where is she?
- l don't know.

580
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,200
But she is expected to attend
Mr Ravi's pam in the evening.

581
01:14:06,279 --> 01:14:08,040
Mr Daaga, l came here because
l had promised you.

582
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:12,200
But l am in no mood to talk
about cases and dates.

583
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:17,080
Fine. We'll talk about it later.

584
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:20,240
What's the matter? You seem to
be in a different mood today?

585
01:14:22,439 --> 01:14:24,560
l'll tell you later. Not now.

586
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:28,920
An_ay, l have arranged a pam
at my house. You must come.

587
01:14:29,239 --> 01:14:32,760
Sure. But we must know
what's the occasion is.

588
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,080
lfyou are keen to know
then l must tell you.

589
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:37,800
lt hasn't been yet finalised.

590
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:42,640
But, l am going to mary.

591
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:49,160
Congrats -But Mr Ravi,
who is the fortunate girl?

592
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:51,680
You must have seen her
in one of my earlier parties.

593
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:01,720
Of course, we must have. If not,
we'll meet her today evening.

594
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:13,840
Congratulations to you,
Mr Daaga.- What for?

595
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,160
For the wedding of Mr Ravi
Kapoor.

596
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:18,600
Meaning?

597
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:27,080
Do you remember we had set our
men to keep an eye on Vijay?

598
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:33,000
To find out who is his informer?

599
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:37,280
Yes. But how does it relate
to Ravi's wedding?

600
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:41,920
Here are some photographs.

601
01:15:42,039 --> 01:15:47,200
Of these, these are worth
seeing.

602
01:15:51,039 --> 01:15:52,240
Who is this girl?

603
01:16:06,079 --> 01:16:07,080
Has Sheetal come?
- No, Sir.

604
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:17,000
Give this to her when she comes.
- All right, Sir.

605
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:24,680
What is the matter? You are
Iooking at the watch incessantly.

606
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:29,960
l was just thinking, neither
Sheetal nor Vijay has come.

607
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:32,280
l wonder iftheywill really
COMe.

608
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:38,240
What? He won't stay away.
He will surely come.

609
01:16:38,439 --> 01:16:41,240
lt is one's imagination.
You might not believe me...

610
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:42,760
We believe. But the world...

611
01:16:44,359 --> 01:16:47,800
Sir, a letter for Miss Sheetal.
- Letter for Sheetal?

612
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:50,920
Who sent it?
- l don't know, Sir.

613
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:54,240
Her watchman gave it to me.
- All right. Keep it carefully.

614
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,880
Now what?
- Now look...

615
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,760
She hasn't come yet, but her letters
have started coming to my house.

616
01:17:04,199 --> 01:17:07,680
l am delighted
to see you happy, Mr Ravi.

617
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,280
But l feel like...
an_ay, forget it.

618
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:16,440
lt's better to keep my mouth
shut.

619
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,600
l don't understand.
What do you mean to say?

620
01:17:21,399 --> 01:17:22,560
l just want to say that...

621
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:25,400
lt's better to remain quiet.

622
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:31,160
What are you doing tomorrow?
Can you drop in at my house?

623
01:17:33,279 --> 01:17:36,160
Just for a while.
We'll talk about some work.

624
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,000
Which may be of importance for
you.

625
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:47,520
Mind you tongue, Mr Daaga!
How dare you accuse my friend?

626
01:17:49,159 --> 01:17:53,400
Because this accusation is true.

627
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,080
Take a look.

628
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,680
You may not believe me...

629
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,560
But, you surely trust
your eyes, don't you?

630
01:18:08,079 --> 01:18:11,520
l knew, that if l show you this,
you might be hurt.

631
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:16,520
But l couldn't bear it.
ARer all, l am your well wisher.

632
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,080
l couldn't bear to see you
cheated.

633
01:18:26,199 --> 01:18:29,600
l was surprised to see that the
one whom you considered ...

634
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:32,520
...a best friend was cheating
you.

635
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:38,080
lt is disgusting, Mr Ravi.
An intelligent person like you...

636
01:18:38,199 --> 01:18:40,720
...had patronised a foe
in the guise of a friend.

637
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:47,000
lf l can patronise a foe,
l can even destroy him.

638
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:49,680
l can even take his head.

639
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:54,680
This deceit will cost dear
to Vijay.

640
01:18:59,079 --> 01:19:00,920
How do l explain it to you? You
don't understand my constraints.

641
01:19:03,319 --> 01:19:07,080
How will l?
l don't understand a thing.

642
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:11,040
l couldn't believe my ears
when Ravi said it.

643
01:19:13,479 --> 01:19:15,360
But l am helpless
against Ravi's belief.

644
01:19:15,479 --> 01:19:19,280
Couldn't you have told him...
- No. l couldn't. No way!

645
01:19:20,399 --> 01:19:23,760
You wouldn't understand. Because
you didn't see him express it.

646
01:19:25,479 --> 01:19:30,240
His voice and utterance carried loads
of hope, expectation and optimism.

647
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:33,960
l'm his friend.
But at that moment...

648
01:19:34,079 --> 01:19:36,960
...not even his enemy could've
had the heart to break his heart.

649
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:44,880
You can't break his heart,
but promises made to me, right?

650
01:19:47,319 --> 01:19:49,160
You have the right to rebuke me.

651
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:53,960
But l can't build a castle of mirth
on the grave of Ravi's dreams.

652
01:19:57,039 --> 01:20:03,520
l have decided to go away from here.
Time is the greatest healer.

653
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:06,000
You'll forget me in no time.

654
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:11,640
lt is possible that
you might leave me.

655
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:18,680
But l'll accept someone else...
Impossible!

656
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:25,200
Getting sentimental won't work.
You can solve this complication.

657
01:20:28,279 --> 01:20:31,560
Go home and give it a thought
with a cool mind.

658
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:33,680
Go, Sheetal.

659
01:20:53,439 --> 01:20:55,200
Driver...
Go home.

660
01:21:16,359 --> 01:21:19,640
Was it Sheetal who went
from here now?-Yes, she came

661
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,800
What did she say?

662
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,880
She said, she hasn't given
a thought to her wedding......

663
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,640
But she said, she will think it
OVel.

664
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:38,760
Don't wory.
l think it will work out.

665
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:45,680
Why won't it work out
when l have a friend like you.

666
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:49,720
An_ay, Vijay...
What did you say to her?

667
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:56,920
l told her that
you love her immensely.

668
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:03,880
And that she should mary you.
It is in the best of her interests.

669
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:12,600
Because she might not get a nice
and faithful person like you.

670
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:15,520
And l even told her...

671
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:19,720
lngrate swine! l never thought
you'd betray my trust in you.

672
01:22:21,399 --> 01:22:24,320
What has happened to you, Ravi?
You are misunderstanding me.

673
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:26,880
l am your friend. - Don't you
utter the name of friendship!

674
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,680
A dog is more faithful than you.
l wish l had reared a dog...

675
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:34,120
...instead of befriending you.
Swine!

676
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:40,040
Had someone else said this,
l would've torn off his tongue.

677
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:42,960
Go away.

678
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:47,120
All right, Vijay, l am going.

679
01:22:47,239 --> 01:22:52,320
You stabbed me behind my back.
But l challenge you in your face!

680
01:22:56,319 --> 01:22:58,200
Swine! And remember this too...

681
01:22:58,319 --> 01:23:05,120
...Our friendship is broken. We
are no more friends, but foes.

682
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,080
lfyou've decided to leave
this place, you won't go alone.

683
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,520
l'll go with you.

684
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:23,760
No., Sheetal. Don't let my
circumstances spoil your life.

685
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:27,760
What has happened has
happened?

686
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:32,200
Tomorrow you will find
a better life-partner than me.

687
01:23:34,119 --> 01:23:37,440
When you find him... just think that
you were not destined for me.

688
01:23:40,279 --> 01:23:44,520
l have told you earlier...
time is the greatest healer.

689
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:47,760
lf not today, tomorrow
you'll surely forget me.

690
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:12,560
''So easy for you to ask me
to forget you...''

691
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:16,680
''to forget you...''

692
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:23,960
''so difficult it is for me
to forget you''

693
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:30,080
''So easy for you to ask me
to forget you...''

694
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:36,080
''so difficult it is for me
to forget you''

695
01:24:41,199 --> 01:24:45,520
lt is easy to tell me to
forget you.

696
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:52,760
But it is so difficult for me
to forget you.

697
01:25:21,039 --> 01:25:26,520
''Without another thought...''

698
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:32,600
''man becomes to become
the pilot ofthe boat...''

699
01:25:34,399 --> 01:25:39,240
''little do they realise...''

700
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:44,960
''there are storms to weather''

701
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:53,720
''So easy it is to take over
the mantle ofthe ship...''

702
01:25:55,720 --> 01:26:00,600
''but it's difficult to row
the boat to the shores''

703
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:06,880
''lt was easy for you to ask me
to forget you...''

704
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:13,520
''but it's so difficult for me
to get over you''

705
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:44,360
''l admit, you are hurt...''

706
01:26:46,039 --> 01:26:50,200
''by the ways ofthe world''

707
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:57,720
''But there were promises we made
to each other in love...''

708
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:02,640
''what shall become
ofthis vows?''

709
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:11,320
''lt's so easy to bre..ak
your promises...

710
01:27:14,079 --> 01:27:18,440
''it's difficult to
honour your word''

711
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:25,320
''lt was easy for you to tell
me to forget you''

712
01:27:25,439 --> 01:27:31,640
''lt's not easy for me
to forget you''

713
01:27:33,239 --> 01:27:35,960
Please don't go away.

714
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:41,160
''So easy for you to ask me
to forget you...''

715
01:28:05,159 --> 01:28:07,200
Your keys, Sir.
l found them on the table.

716
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:28,440
lt's no use to vent your anger
on lifeless beings, Mr Ravi.

717
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:34,000
You gain nothing ifyou succumb
to your own fire of hatred.

718
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:38,680
Those who've reduced
your desires to dust...

719
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:41,080
...are the ones who should burn
in this fire.

720
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,160
How is it possible?- Nothing is
impossible for a man.

721
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:53,560
The pinch is that, you have never
identified your friends and foes.

722
01:28:54,680 --> 01:29:00,400
Give us the orders, and you'll see
we can destroy anyone for you!

723
01:29:03,439 --> 01:29:03,920
No.

724
01:29:08,359 --> 01:29:13,560
l don't want him to die. l want
to make life hell for him.

725
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:18,400
l'll help you.
And you help us.

726
01:29:20,119 --> 01:29:26,240
The day we join hands, Vijay will
find no place in the world to run.

727
01:29:27,479 --> 01:29:30,720
Do you agree with me, Mr Ravi?

728
01:29:32,359 --> 01:29:35,480
lfyou want to settle a score
with him, then join hands with me.

729
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:43,440
All right, Mr Daaga.
l agree to your offer.

730
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:50,360
From today we are one.
And we have a common foe.

731
01:31:54,359 --> 01:31:57,000
What's all this?
- Nothing.

732
01:31:57,119 --> 01:31:59,520
l had a few guests yesterday night.
We had a brawl. Be seated.

733
01:32:03,079 --> 01:32:08,120
Be serious. Tell me the truth.
Did they come again?

734
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:11,440
Yes. But there's nothing to wory.
Nothing has happened to me.

735
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:15,160
But, Vijay, how long
will this continue?

736
01:32:19,119 --> 01:32:23,200
Vijay, l am Tony here.
l have an information for you.

737
01:32:23,319 --> 01:32:27,000
Go ahead.-Their boat is arriving
on the 16th...

738
01:32:27,119 --> 01:32:30,240
...at Ghodbunder
at l in the morning.

739
01:32:30,359 --> 01:32:35,680
l am sory, but the way the police
have caught your consignments...

740
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:46,920
...lt is clear that one ofyour
men is an informer.

741
01:32:48,680 --> 01:32:50,360
Hear that? Didn't l tell you?

742
01:32:52,439 --> 01:32:57,680
You are right, Mr Ravi. l ty to
keep a watch on all my men.

743
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:00,840
But, l have around 450 men
working for me.

744
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,560
lt isn't impossible to find
the informer.

745
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:09,640
But it is rather difficult.

746
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:12,400
Perhaps the information ofthe
boat coming on the 16th...

747
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,520
...might have reached the police.

748
01:33:19,399 --> 01:33:23,280
Never mind. So what
ifthe police is informed?

749
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:28,960
The boat will definitely come
to Ghodbunder on the 16th morning.

750
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:24,920
Bravo! Mr Ravi, you are amazing.

751
01:34:25,039 --> 01:34:29,960
Tell me something. How did you
come upon this trick?

752
01:34:33,039 --> 01:34:35,640
lt crossed my mind that if someone
among us is the informer...

753
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:38,040
...he must also get
the wrong information.

754
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:41,880
Till the last moment
all our men knew...

755
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,080
...that the boat was
coming to the beach.

756
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:49,480
But l guided it elsewhere. The
boat which docked at the beach...

757
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,520
...carried only fish.

758
01:34:54,479 --> 01:34:57,440
Congrats! It was wonderFul!

759
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:09,160
Mr Daaga, this is my first move.
No one can ever think ofthe end.

760
01:35:10,479 --> 01:35:12,800
What is the matter, Mr Daaga?
You mo are deviating from the crowd?

761
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:16,000
Nothing, Mr Ojha.
We are enjoying.

762
01:35:16,119 --> 01:35:19,640
Mr Ravi seems to be bored.

763
01:35:23,159 --> 01:35:27,360
No, Mr Ojha, l am enjoying it.
Please don't wory about me.

764
01:35:45,399 --> 01:35:46,360
Welcome!

765
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:51,240
Please come..

766
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:00,280
Sheetal, Roma is in town.
-Really? Where is she now?

767
01:36:00,399 --> 01:36:02,000
Right here. Come with me.

768
01:36:07,319 --> 01:36:09,320
You aren't taking anything?

769
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,120
Mr Vijay, you are a talked about
singer in parties.

770
01:36:17,239 --> 01:36:23,120
People are waiting anxiously
to hear you. Say what?

771
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:25,640
Sure, Mr Ojha.

772
01:36:28,319 --> 01:36:30,600
Today l will surely sing.
- That's more like it.

773
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:38,800
Hold your breath.
Our good friend Mr Vijay Verma...

774
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:43,840
...will now enlighten this evening
with his sweet voice.

775
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:18,600
''This sure is an unusual
stoy l hear, my friend...''

776
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:34,440
''l'm told you have
turned unfaithful''

777
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:42,800
''This sure is an unusual
stoy l hear, my friend...''

778
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:49,120
''l'm told you have
turned unfaithful''

779
01:38:13,079 --> 01:38:25,520
''That you might wish me ill,
is impossible...''

780
01:38:27,479 --> 01:38:32,960
''that you might let me down,
is not possible''

781
01:38:35,399 --> 01:38:44,760
''God knows what..has gone
wrong...

782
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:58,840
''l'm told you have
turned unfaithful''

783
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:35,080
''Should you ask for it,
my dear friend...''

784
01:39:36,199 --> 01:39:43,560
''l'd happily lay down my life
for you, in the belief...''

785
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:54,800
''that l have been a good friend''

786
01:39:56,920 --> 01:40:09,560
''But l'm told that you
have turned unfaithful''

787
01:40:42,359 --> 01:40:54,360
''This blow is no less shocking
than an apocalypse, my friend...''

788
01:40:54,479 --> 01:41:01,800
''that you and l speak for ourselves,
not for the mo of us''

789
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:13,040
''My friend has separated
from me...''

790
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:27,800
''l am told you that you
have turned unfaithful''

791
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:36,080
''This sure is an unusual
stoy l hear, my friend...''

792
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:50,160
''l'm told you have
turned unfaithful''

793
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:08,320
Great! WonderFul, Mr Vijay
Varma.

794
01:42:10,239 --> 01:42:13,080
What a voice!
What style!

795
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:20,720
Friends, aRer this
beautiful perFormance...

796
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:28,760
...you'd like to know
who the disloyal friend is.

797
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,800
Friends, here l am
...the disloyal friend.

798
01:42:35,359 --> 01:42:41,600
Yes. l am the one.
l am disloyal.

799
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:48,560
Because, at the age of seven
when his parents passed away...

800
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:53,000
...and leR him alone,
my parents sheltered him.

801
01:42:53,439 --> 01:42:55,800
They educated him and made
an able man out of him.

802
01:42:58,119 --> 01:43:04,360
l am disloyal. Because, all my life
l trusted him like a brother.

803
01:43:05,079 --> 01:43:07,880
l am disloyal. Because,
l took him for a friend.

804
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:13,200
And he is the loyal one. Indeed,
he is. Because he ruined me.

805
01:43:13,319 --> 01:43:15,720
He is the loyal one, because,
he betrayed my trust on him.

806
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:21,440
He is the loyal one! Indeed, as
he stabbed me on my back.

807
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:24,160
Just for the sake of a girl...
- Enough!

808
01:43:24,279 --> 01:43:26,880
l've had enough.
You've tested my patience.

809
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:31,640
There might be a feud bemeen us, but
l always regarded you as a friend.

810
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:35,080
But now, one more word
from you and...!

811
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:39,040
What? What will happen then?

812
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:46,000
l warn you, you had better
go away, Ravi.

813
01:43:46,119 --> 01:43:48,680
Listen to me. Go.
- l see.

814
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:53,520
lt hurts to see that
for the sake of a lowly girl...

815
01:43:56,199 --> 01:43:57,880
Leave me!
- Hold it, Vijay?

816
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,120
Let me go.
- Come on, Ravi.

817
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,080
Cur! How dare you?

818
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:04,120
Come, Vijay...

819
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,200
Leave me, l say!

820
01:44:24,279 --> 01:44:25,200
Stop here.

821
01:44:27,079 --> 01:44:28,440
Wait here. l'll be back.

822
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:43,600
How is Johnny?

823
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:12,280
Lie down, dear. How are you?
- When will l get well?

824
01:45:12,399 --> 01:45:14,680
Vey soon.
- Really?

825
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:19,280
Can l play cricket with you then?
- Yes, my son.

826
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:21,200
Can l swim?
-Yes, my son

827
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:26,000
Can l ride on the beach?
- Yes.

828
01:45:30,239 --> 01:45:33,760
lt's time for lunch.
Say goodbye to daddy.

829
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:35,320
He'll come again.

830
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:00,360
Johnny is being taken care of
and given full treatment.

831
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:15,200
Here's 25000. For the school's
helpless kids.

832
01:46:15,319 --> 01:46:17,080
Keep them.

833
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:24,080
This information
is cent percent true.

834
01:46:24,199 --> 01:46:29,280
l know my informations
have gone wrong sometimes.

835
01:46:29,399 --> 01:46:32,240
But this time there's
no chance for it.

836
01:46:32,359 --> 01:46:35,640
Tomorrow Daaga's gold
will reach Rethighat surely.

837
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:44,400
l pray, this information
is true, Tony.

838
01:46:46,199 --> 01:46:49,520
Because, this may be the last time
l get an information from you.

839
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:53,720
l am taking a transfer.

840
01:46:54,479 --> 01:46:56,920
You are going away?
- Yes, Tony.

841
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:02,760
lt won't make any difference to
you. l will be replaced.

842
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:09,040
You can cary on your work.The
government will give your prize.

843
01:47:12,039 --> 01:47:15,680
You think l am doing
all this for money?

844
01:47:17,039 --> 01:47:21,440
How do l know your intentions?
l only know your name.

845
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:28,680
l don't know what you are. And why
you take risk against smugglers.

846
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:31,640
Nor l know your source
of information.

847
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:35,760
Perhaps l wouldn't tell you.
But since you are going away...

848
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:41,920
l will tell you. Because l don't
want you to remember me...

849
01:47:42,039 --> 01:47:47,320
...as a person who does this
just for the sake of money.

850
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:54,240
No, Vijay. Had l any greed for money
l wouldn't have had to face this.

851
01:47:56,720 --> 01:48:01,480
With the small earnings l received,
l was vey happy with my family.

852
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:06,200
l used to work for a check-post
on the Bombay-Goa Highway.

853
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:10,400
One evening aRer office hours
when l was returning home...

854
01:48:12,119 --> 01:48:13,960
...all of a sudden a car...

855
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:36,560
Who are you?
What do you want?

856
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:40,600
Are you Tony?

857
01:48:42,079 --> 01:48:44,120
Are you the officer-in-charge
of Kantawadi check-post?

858
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:46,440
Yes..
-Don't shout.

859
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:50,280
Listen carefully.

860
01:48:52,239 --> 01:49:00,200
On the 18th ofthis month a van
whose number is BMR 2432...

861
01:49:00,319 --> 01:49:09,640
...will pass by your check-post.
And you'll bypass the van.

862
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:13,920
You think l'll agree to it, do
you?

863
01:49:14,439 --> 01:49:16,960
You will be paid for this.

864
01:49:17,239 --> 01:49:21,280
This isn't a pay.
This is called a bribe!

865
01:49:21,399 --> 01:49:24,960
And l never accept bribe.
Do whatever you want.

866
01:49:25,279 --> 01:49:30,760
Your wife's name is Teresa. And
your son's name is Johnny, isn't it?

867
01:49:33,399 --> 01:49:36,880
You have a beautiful wife
and a lovely kid!

868
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:41,560
What do you mean?

869
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:49,680
The van should pass your check-post
on the 18th without checking.

870
01:49:51,239 --> 01:49:56,440
Else, you and your family
will be terminated.

871
01:51:27,159 --> 01:51:30,400
Johnny, there comes the bus.
You go home with mummy. l...

872
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:27,400
When l regained consciousness,
l was in the hospital.

873
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:32,080
My wife... buried.

874
01:52:32,199 --> 01:52:41,320
And my son was maimed.
His limbs maimed for life!

875
01:52:43,079 --> 01:52:48,160
l had to pay heavily for my
honesty.

876
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:58,640
My life was ruined.
l decided to avenge my loss.

877
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:05,600
l started getting information
about smugglers.

878
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:08,680
And l became your informer.

879
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:13,840
l am not doing this for money.

880
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:23,080
l donate the money l receive
to the centre for the handicapped

881
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:33,600
The centre in which my son lies
maimed for life. And asks me...

882
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:38,440
Daddy, when will l be able to walk,
run and play cricket again?

883
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:39,600
When...?

884
01:53:54,119 --> 01:53:58,440
You have helped me a lot, Tony.
Now it is my turn...

885
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:04,680
..to bring that swines to book
who have put you in utter grief.

886
01:55:16,119 --> 01:55:20,360
ln the last one year he must've seized
at least 20 million ofyour gold.

887
01:55:20,479 --> 01:55:24,880
lsn't it?
- l can't find a cure for him.

888
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:36,080
This man is uncurable. And an
uncurable man can't live for long.

889
01:55:41,359 --> 01:55:42,400
You are right, Balwant.

890
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:53,440
Order our men to finish Vijay.

891
01:57:07,199 --> 01:57:10,320
We have identified the dead body
ofthe driver. His name is Balbeer.

892
01:57:10,439 --> 01:57:13,720
He has been jailed several times.
We have arrested his cronies.

893
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:16,160
Take a look at them.
Maybe you'd recognise someone.

894
01:57:16,279 --> 01:57:19,960
Tough. It was night.
And they were all in cars.

895
01:57:20,079 --> 01:57:22,680
An_ay, l'll take a look.
- Fine.

896
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:44,840
But take down their statements.
Enquire where they were last night.

897
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:47,560
And verify the truth
oftheir statements.

898
01:57:48,079 --> 01:57:50,400
All right. Constable, lock them
up.

899
01:57:51,159 --> 01:57:52,480
Wait a moment, Inspector.

900
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:02,720
l am Ravi Kapoor. And l am
the lawyer of all these five.

901
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:10,120
Since l am their lawyer,
l'd like to say that...

902
01:58:10,239 --> 01:58:14,640
...they won't give their
statements before l talk to them.

903
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:21,840
You can speak to them.
-l haven't come here to speak.

904
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:27,000
l'm here to take them along with me.
These are their bail papers.

905
01:58:28,279 --> 01:58:31,520
And these are orders
for their immediate release.

906
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:33,080
lt is signed by the magistrate.

907
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:38,000
Release them.

908
01:58:40,079 --> 01:58:44,360
They may be either guilty, or not.
Ifthey aren't guilty....

909
01:58:44,479 --> 01:58:47,600
...we have no reasons to put them
behind bars even for a second.

910
01:58:50,039 --> 01:58:52,240
And ifthey are guilty, the hands
ofthe law will surely...

911
01:58:52,359 --> 01:58:58,400
...reach their neck someday. And
they can't be bailed out then.

912
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:08,800
Looks like their days are numbered.
-You said you'd arrange a meeting...

913
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:11,320
...with one oftheir men.
- Yes.

914
01:59:12,279 --> 01:59:15,000
Today you'll see my source
of information.

915
01:59:15,119 --> 01:59:19,680
And there a good reason for it.
- Where is he?

916
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:24,680
You?

917
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:30,600
ls she...?
- Yes. Sylvia is my spy.

918
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:35,120
She's my unfortunate wife's
sister.

919
01:59:35,239 --> 01:59:39,120
Didn't they ever suspect you?
-No. l'd give only those...

920
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:44,240
... informations which was also
known to Daaga's confidantes.

921
01:59:47,319 --> 01:59:49,840
But why did you open
this secret to me.

922
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:53,800
Simple. The information
she has brought today...

923
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:57,840
...has the potential to bring to
book Daaga and his men.

924
01:59:57,960 --> 02:00:01,960
But before arresting them
l wanted you to know the fact...

925
02:00:02,079 --> 02:00:06,960
...that Sylvia is not one ofthem.
She is with the police.

926
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:09,200
What's the information?

927
02:00:10,319 --> 02:00:14,160
Here. He is Tiwari.
Daaga's close aid.

928
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:19,440
He maintains the accounts
of all of Daaga's black money.

929
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:23,880
Daaga has hidden with him a secret
file which contains...

930
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,840
...all information pertaining
to his black money accounts.

931
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:31,320
To get hold ofthe file,
it's crucial to nab Tiwari.

932
02:00:32,399 --> 02:00:33,720
Now the question is,
where can we find him?

933
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:39,360
To elude the police, he stays in
a vey cheap and unheard-of hotel.

934
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:47,560
Welcome. Do you want a room?
- Yes.

935
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:50,080
40 bucks for a single bed.
And 10 for a double.

936
02:00:50,199 --> 02:00:54,760
Which one would you like to
have?- Let me think.

937
02:00:56,279 --> 02:00:58,800
Who is this?
- You don't know her?

938
02:00:58,920 --> 02:01:03,000
You are kidding, aren't you?
She is actress Hema Malini.

939
02:01:03,119 --> 02:01:07,760
And who is this?- Come on!
You don't know him?

940
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:10,480
He is actor Dev Anand.

941
02:01:11,439 --> 02:01:13,400
Great! You are good
at identifying photographs.

942
02:01:15,640 --> 02:01:17,240
You know him?
- Him?

943
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Who are you?
-Police

944
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:26,440
Do you know him?
- No, l don't know him.

945
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:28,400
Looks like your memoy isn't
that good like l guessed.

946
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:34,080
Never mind. Tax your brains and
tell me ifyou have seen him earlier.

947
02:01:34,239 --> 02:01:38,960
Sir, l told you, l don't know him.
l have never seen him.

948
02:01:41,439 --> 02:01:44,240
Maybe. But, give it a ty.

949
02:01:44,359 --> 02:01:47,640
l'll come back tomorrow.

950
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:01,920
Room no. 12 ? Mr Tiwari?
l am the manager speaking.

951
02:02:02,039 --> 02:02:06,920
There is a hassle. A C.l.D
officer came asking for you.

952
02:02:07,039 --> 02:02:13,200
He is coming back tomorrow.
He just leR. Check out soon. Please!

953
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:09,720
Tiwari may spit evemhing out
under pressure from the police.

954
02:03:12,760 --> 02:03:20,080
He cannot be trusted in this
matter.

955
02:03:21,439 --> 02:03:24,800
How long will you keep shut, Tiwari?
There's only one way out for you.

956
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:31,160
Give evidence and names
of all the people you work for.

957
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:39,760
l don't know anything.
l don't know their names.

958
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:41,560
Liar! You are lying.

959
02:03:45,359 --> 02:03:49,000
Listen Mr Tiwari
l know you work for D!aaga.

960
02:03:49,119 --> 02:03:54,000
You can give evidence against his
men. And that you certainly will.

961
02:03:54,319 --> 02:03:57,000
l don't know anything. Really.

962
02:03:57,119 --> 02:04:02,680
Even ifyou refuse for a thousand
years, you will have to give it.

963
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:07,320
l am ignorant.
l don't have any evidence.

964
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:14,120
Even ifyou give your life
refusing it, l won't believe you.

965
02:04:16,640 --> 02:04:18,960
The commissioner is calling you.
- Coming.

966
02:04:22,199 --> 02:04:27,400
Think it over. You have to tell me.
l won't let you go.

967
02:04:29,039 --> 02:04:29,960
Lock him up.

968
02:04:38,479 --> 02:04:40,640
Get up. Come on!

969
02:04:49,560 --> 02:04:50,480
Bring him.

970
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:35,840
You? Here?

971
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:37,960
We have come for you.

972
02:05:38,079 --> 02:05:41,800
l knew he would do
something for me.

973
02:05:44,319 --> 02:05:48,880
He has planned evemhing...
to get you out of here.

974
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:55,000
To get me out of here? How?
- Do you see that ventilator?

975
02:05:55,119 --> 02:05:58,560
Ventilator?
- Yes. That one.

976
02:06:21,279 --> 02:06:25,160
lnspector sir...Constable, see
what has happened to this man.

977
02:06:25,279 --> 02:06:27,280
Help him. He is dying.

978
02:06:29,720 --> 02:06:33,680
What's the matter?
- Tiwari is dead.

979
02:06:49,960 --> 02:06:53,120
The post mortem reports says, he died
due to fracture ofthe cervical bone.

980
02:06:53,239 --> 02:06:56,480
l hope you aren't thinking
that l have done it?

981
02:06:56,600 --> 02:06:59,280
This is absurd. l myself don't
know how it happened.

982
02:06:59,399 --> 02:07:01,600
Believe me, sir, Tiwari was
vey important to me.

983
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:06,480
Until yesterday the charge on you was
that you took the law in your hands.

984
02:07:06,600 --> 02:07:10,040
But today, the charge is that
you have broken the law.

985
02:07:10,159 --> 02:07:11,840
Sir, believe me...

986
02:07:25,479 --> 02:07:31,400
How did this happen?
- Don't ask me. Because...

987
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:38,160
Even if others don't believe
l am innocent, you would.

988
02:07:38,279 --> 02:07:41,240
Not only me, but the whole world
will know that you are innocent.

989
02:07:41,359 --> 02:07:47,480
l am sure you'll be proved innocent
in the court. You are innocent.

990
02:08:00,399 --> 02:08:03,720
l don't want to ruin my career
with this case.

991
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:11,960
There's no life in this case.
It's difficult to win it.

992
02:08:13,720 --> 02:08:15,960
The fact is, there's no life
in this case.

993
02:08:16,079 --> 02:08:20,600
Even a lawyer like Ravi Kapoor
would fret to take this case.

994
02:08:27,319 --> 02:08:28,880
Sir, Miss Sheetal Sahney has
COMe.

995
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,480
Who has come?- Miss Sheetal
has come to see you.

996
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:55,280
Yes, Miss Sheetal Sahney?

997
02:08:57,800 --> 02:08:59,760
What made you remember me?

998
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:03,200
l have come to ask your help.

999
02:09:03,319 --> 02:09:08,880
You've lost that right,
Miss Sheetal.

1000
02:09:10,199 --> 02:09:14,160
An_ay, tell me.
- Vijay is in a fix.

1001
02:09:14,279 --> 02:09:17,480
He is charged with murder.
- l know.

1002
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:23,360
You are the only lawyer
who can prove him innocent.

1003
02:09:23,479 --> 02:09:25,400
l am aware ofthis too.

1004
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:34,920
l can easily win this case for him.
Because, l know he is innocent.

1005
02:09:36,319 --> 02:09:39,360
ln the court, l can prove it
in a minute.

1006
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:46,960
But Madam, l won't do it. Never.

1007
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:50,360
lt's a question of his life.

1008
02:09:50,479 --> 02:09:56,960
Once it was the question of my life.
That day you didn't remember me.

1009
02:09:57,079 --> 02:10:01,200
Forget the past, Ravi.
- How will l, Sheetal? How?

1010
02:10:03,159 --> 02:10:05,120
What else is leR in my life,
but memories ofthe past?

1011
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:09,360
And what should l forget?
Should l forget that the girl...

1012
02:10:09,479 --> 02:10:14,520
... l madly loved refused me
and went with someone else?

1013
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:17,120
Should l forget the fact that the
friend whom l considered a brother...

1014
02:10:17,239 --> 02:10:21,520
...disregarded my sentiments and
carried on with the girl l loved?

1015
02:10:21,640 --> 02:10:25,680
Should l also forget that
in your love he forgot me?

1016
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:31,200
And should l forget that in order
to possess you... he leR me?

1017
02:10:31,319 --> 02:10:35,240
To forget all these, one must
have an heavenly heart.

1018
02:10:36,319 --> 02:10:38,040
And l have never tried
to be heavenly.

1019
02:10:38,159 --> 02:10:43,240
lfyou have any complaints in
this regard, it must be with me.

1020
02:10:43,359 --> 02:10:47,360
Complaints are always
against our own people, Madam.

1021
02:10:47,479 --> 02:10:53,400
l can't complain,
but trade with you.

1022
02:10:53,520 --> 02:10:58,520
lfyou can save Vijay, l am
ready to pay any price for it.

1023
02:10:59,520 --> 02:11:05,040
Any price, eh? Once you rejected
me. That day you made me ...

1024
02:11:05,159 --> 02:11:07,920
...realise the price of my heart,
my love and my sentiments.

1025
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:12,200
Today l'll you quote the price...

1026
02:11:12,319 --> 02:11:16,720
...for my talent, my intelligence
and my brains.

1027
02:11:18,399 --> 02:11:22,400
You love Vijay. l loved you.

1028
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:27,320
You don't want to lose him.
l don't want to lose against him.

1029
02:11:27,439 --> 02:11:33,680
These mo things are possible.
Yes, it's possible.

1030
02:11:34,399 --> 02:11:41,560
l can save him from the gallows.
And you can have him for life.

1031
02:11:44,720 --> 02:11:48,680
But Sheetal, the day
he is termed innocent...

1032
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:54,800
...that nightyou will sleep with
Me.

1033
02:11:56,399 --> 02:12:01,120
That night you'll have to
sleep with me, Sheetal.

1034
02:12:04,199 --> 02:12:10,800
Would you stoop down to this
Ievel?- l've quoted my price.

1035
02:12:12,399 --> 02:12:14,400
lt's in your hands to accept
or turn down the offer.

1036
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:17,800
Then listen...

1037
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:23,680
lsn't your anger and hatred directed
towards my love for Vijay?

1038
02:12:23,800 --> 02:12:30,800
You will be offended. It will also
hurt you. But, hear it.

1039
02:12:30,920 --> 02:12:38,360
l love Vijay to the extent that,
to save him l accept your condition.

1040
02:12:39,159 --> 02:12:40,320
Yes.

1041
02:12:49,119 --> 02:12:51,720
My first witness is Inspector
Shinde.

1042
02:12:55,640 --> 02:13:01,360
What did you see in the interrogation
room? And what did you hear?

1043
02:13:04,239 --> 02:13:08,240
l saw Mr Vijay Varma
jerk Tiwari violently and say...

1044
02:13:08,359 --> 02:13:13,520
''Even ifyou give your life
refusing it, l won't believe you''

1045
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:16,880
l see. Then?

1046
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:21,400
Mr. Vijay Verma went to see the
commissioner as l told him so.

1047
02:13:22,640 --> 02:13:25,520
He told me to lead Tiwari
to the lock-up.

1048
02:13:26,279 --> 02:13:30,360
Did you lead him to the
Iock-up?

1049
02:13:31,640 --> 02:13:33,920
No. l had to take the help
of a constable.

1050
02:13:34,039 --> 02:13:37,760
What for?
- He wasn't able to stand.

1051
02:13:37,880 --> 02:13:42,280
He was yelling for water.
The constable helped him out.

1052
02:13:42,399 --> 02:13:47,560
He gave him water
and lead him to the lock-up.

1053
02:13:49,279 --> 02:13:56,160
ln another five minutes
he died, right?... -Yes

1054
02:13:59,439 --> 02:14:01,880
Defense Counsel, do you want to
question the witness?

1055
02:14:03,439 --> 02:14:06,400
No, your honour.
l don't have any questions.

1056
02:14:13,199 --> 02:14:16,160
My next witness is Baldev Singh.

1057
02:14:20,279 --> 02:14:26,480
Were you and Tiwari
in the same lock-up? - Yes.

1058
02:14:28,439 --> 02:14:33,680
So, he died in front ofyou? In
what state was he before he died?

1059
02:14:33,800 --> 02:14:34,920
What did he say?

1060
02:14:37,079 --> 02:14:41,640
ARer the mo constables leR
him, he rolled about in pain.

1061
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:44,360
His eyes were shut.
But, he was screaming...

1062
02:14:44,479 --> 02:14:47,800
''l don't know anything.
Please don't hit me''

1063
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:51,240
And then he gave a loud cy,
''He killed me''

1064
02:14:51,359 --> 02:14:53,400
And there he was... dead.

1065
02:14:57,319 --> 02:14:59,960
Defense Counsel, would you like to
question the witness?

1066
02:15:02,039 --> 02:15:03,400
No, your honour.

1067
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:11,560
My next witness is
Dr. Karamchandani.

1068
02:15:17,439 --> 02:15:20,880
Did you perForm the post mortem
on Tiwari's dead body?-Yes..

1069
02:15:22,439 --> 02:15:27,560
lt's is clear that his death occurred
due to fracture in cervical bone.

1070
02:15:29,479 --> 02:15:33,360
lsn't it possible that he must've
fallen in the lock-up...

1071
02:15:33,479 --> 02:15:38,360
..and broke his bone?
- No. Had he fallen that bad...

1072
02:15:38,479 --> 02:15:44,960
...there would've been an injuy to
his head. l didn't find anything.

1073
02:15:45,079 --> 02:15:49,520
And it is vey clear that his death
wasn't accidental, but he was killed.

1074
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:57,080
Defense Counsel, any questions?

1075
02:16:08,520 --> 02:16:11,520
l won't take much ofyour time.
Just a couple of simple questions.

1076
02:16:11,640 --> 02:16:16,000
ls it established that
Ramniklal Tiwari...

1077
02:16:16,119 --> 02:16:21,800
...died due to a cervical fracture?
- Yes. No doubt about it.

1078
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:25,880
Agreed. ARer all you are a doctor.
One more question, doctor.

1079
02:16:28,279 --> 02:16:30,600
lnspector Shinde had stated
that...

1080
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:35,560
...aRer Inspector Vijay went
to see the commissioner...

1081
02:16:35,680 --> 02:16:42,360
...a constable took Tiwari
out ofthe interrogation room...

1082
02:16:42,479 --> 02:16:49,880
...and gave him water since he
was screaming for water.

1083
02:16:50,760 --> 02:16:56,120
Now l want to know doctor, that,
if a person's cervical bone...

1084
02:16:56,239 --> 02:17:01,800
...is ruptured, like Tiwari's,
would he be able to drink water?

1085
02:17:06,319 --> 02:17:08,200
lt looked like a compound
fracture.

1086
02:17:09,639 --> 02:17:13,400
l would say, it's impossible that
water could enter his gullet.

1087
02:17:13,520 --> 02:17:17,240
ln fact it's impossible to move.

1088
02:17:17,360 --> 02:17:25,920
Doctor, aRer Inspector Vijay
went out, Tiwari did drink water.

1089
02:17:26,440 --> 02:17:34,840
lt implies that his bone never
cracked in front of Inspector Vijay...

1090
02:17:34,959 --> 02:17:39,800
...or in the interrogation room.

1091
02:17:40,879 --> 02:17:44,600
Am l right?
-Yes. Absolutely.

1092
02:17:56,120 --> 02:18:01,960
ARer this, do l have to say that
Inspector Vijay is innocent?

1093
02:18:03,799 --> 02:18:06,000
And that, all allegations against
him for the murder of ...

1094
02:18:06,120 --> 02:18:11,960
...Ramniklal Tiwari is absurd, is
baseless and untrue?

1095
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:30,000
The court terms Vijay as innocent.
And releases him with all honour.

1096
02:18:51,479 --> 02:18:54,800
Sir, l was arranging files
in the cupboard.

1097
02:18:54,920 --> 02:18:58,400
l found this sealed letter.
- A sealed Letter?

1098
02:18:58,600 --> 02:19:05,440
Yes. l don't know how it got there.
Since it doesn't bear your name.

1099
02:19:05,559 --> 02:19:09,960
Then whose letter it is?
- Sheetal Sahney's.

1100
02:19:24,200 --> 02:19:26,840
''Sheetal, l'm writing this letter
out of sheer helplessness.''

1101
02:19:27,159 --> 02:19:30,600
''The days when we were
seeing each other, we were...

1102
02:19:30,719 --> 02:19:36,720
... ignorant about the fact that
Ravi loved you whole heartedly.''

1103
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:40,760
''Believe me,
had l any inkling ofthis...

1104
02:19:40,879 --> 02:19:46,560
...l would've considered it a sin
to cary on with you.''

1105
02:19:46,680 --> 02:19:52,440
''l can forsake my love. But l
can't leave my friend in agony.''

1106
02:20:09,079 --> 02:20:13,400
''Would you do me a favour?
Mary Ravi. Vijay''

1107
02:20:52,799 --> 02:21:04,160
''Those days of our dreams,
those days of our books...''

1108
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:10,320
''those nights of questioning,
those days of answers''

1109
02:21:10,440 --> 02:21:17,160
''We have spent many years
here together...''

1110
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:25,280
''it's here that we played together,
and grew up''

1111
02:21:27,520 --> 02:21:32,720
''Our childhood was
so vey romantic...''

1112
02:21:32,840 --> 02:21:37,920
''may our friendship
always live on''

1113
02:21:38,440 --> 02:21:44,080
''Even ifthe world
turns an enemy...''

1114
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:50,280
''may our friendship
always live on''

1115
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:00,160
Please forgive me!

1116
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:09,000
l have come to fulfil
your condition.

1117
02:22:12,600 --> 02:22:14,080
l'll spend this night here.

1118
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:25,600
My god!

1119
02:22:27,079 --> 02:22:30,720
Don't wory. l won't consume
this poison before dawn.

1120
02:22:31,399 --> 02:22:34,000
No, Sheetal. Forgive me.

1121
02:22:36,280 --> 02:22:42,720
l misunderstood Vijay. And you too.
l doubted his friendship.

1122
02:22:42,840 --> 02:22:44,960
l misunderstood both ofyou.

1123
02:22:47,159 --> 02:22:53,240
Yes, Sheetal. Forgive me.
Take me to my friend.

1124
02:22:54,120 --> 02:22:55,440
Where is my friend?

1125
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:04,360
Ravi wants to meet you, Vijay.

1126
02:23:06,239 --> 02:23:06,800
Me?

1127
02:23:08,840 --> 02:23:12,680
Look Sheetal, l don't understand
Ravi's behaviour in the court.

1128
02:23:12,799 --> 02:23:17,880
l never got to meet you aRer that.
And l couldn't even thank him...

1129
02:23:18,399 --> 02:23:24,120
We can talk later. As of now,
the letter you had written for me...

1130
02:23:24,239 --> 02:23:28,480
...it never reached me,
but today it did find Ravi.

1131
02:23:31,280 --> 02:23:34,280
He is vey ashamed.
He wants to talk to you.

1132
02:23:37,479 --> 02:23:41,320
Where is he?
- With me. Speak to him.

1133
02:23:46,719 --> 02:23:49,800
When your heart holds no grudges,
then why be ashamed?

1134
02:23:49,920 --> 02:23:51,160
Speak to him.

1135
02:24:09,559 --> 02:24:10,800
How are you, my friend?

1136
02:24:12,159 --> 02:24:15,360
l am a bad man, Vijay.
- Come on!

1137
02:24:15,479 --> 02:24:23,280
Don't be silly. It happens.
Perhaps l would've done the same...

1138
02:24:23,399 --> 02:24:28,680
No, Vijay. You would never do it.

1139
02:24:31,920 --> 02:24:39,600
Listen to me. l am coming.
l'll be right there.

1140
02:24:52,719 --> 02:24:54,160
You are coming with us.

1141
02:24:58,079 --> 02:25:01,280
What do you want? - Daaga
will hold court on you today.

1142
02:25:13,440 --> 02:25:19,200
Yes, Mr Ravi Kapoor, the great
criminal lawyer. How are you?

1143
02:25:20,760 --> 02:25:24,720
Come to the point, Daaga.
- Oh really?

1144
02:25:26,479 --> 02:25:28,440
You are well aware of how
Inspector Vijay is harmful to us.

1145
02:25:28,559 --> 02:25:33,240
Even then you saved him
to see this girl happy?

1146
02:25:33,360 --> 02:25:36,200
You didn't even think
of my wrath, did you?

1147
02:25:36,319 --> 02:25:43,520
You have committed a great blunder.
He must pay for this, right Sylvia?

1148
02:25:52,440 --> 02:25:57,240
A bruise? So early? You still have
to sustain some clobbering.

1149
02:25:59,520 --> 02:26:03,720
l agree, you want to take
revenge on me. But why Sheetal?

1150
02:26:03,840 --> 02:26:05,640
Let her go.

1151
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:07,920
Let her go?

1152
02:26:12,440 --> 02:26:14,840
No, Mr Ravi. How will l let her
go?

1153
02:26:14,959 --> 02:26:18,440
She'll go to the police station
right away.

1154
02:26:18,559 --> 02:26:24,440
And why must she?
Let the poor thing come here.

1155
02:26:24,559 --> 02:26:26,080
Here l am, Daaga.

1156
02:26:29,440 --> 02:26:30,480
Bravo!

1157
02:26:34,360 --> 02:26:36,160
Tell all you men not to move.

1158
02:26:37,840 --> 02:26:41,640
lf anyone dares to move
even a finger, then...

1159
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:44,720
...before something happens to
me, l'll shoot you dead.

1160
02:27:18,840 --> 02:27:20,760
Take him away. Tie him up!

1161
02:27:23,639 --> 02:27:26,600
l'll see you, Daaga!
- That's future tense.

1162
02:27:26,719 --> 02:27:29,640
l am seeing both ofyou now.

1163
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:37,480
l want to ask you something, Vijay.
Who among us is your informer?

1164
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:43,400
l need to know the traitor.-Let
me free, and l'll tell you all.

1165
02:27:44,200 --> 02:27:48,200
Really? So you won't reveal it,
eh?

1166
02:27:54,200 --> 02:27:58,280
Don't be silly, Mr Vijay.
Tell me the informer's name.

1167
02:27:59,879 --> 02:28:04,440
You think l'll tell you, do you?
- And why not?

1168
02:28:06,399 --> 02:28:08,240
What doesn't a man do
to escape from pain?

1169
02:28:08,360 --> 02:28:16,000
Values and principles does matter.
But the human body is vey weak.

1170
02:28:17,760 --> 02:28:22,840
The skin, the flesh
and the bones can endure pain...

1171
02:28:22,959 --> 02:28:28,400
...but their threshold can be
broken.

1172
02:28:31,440 --> 02:28:32,480
Who was it?

1173
02:28:35,159 --> 02:28:37,880
Actually, this is a worthless
whip.

1174
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:42,000
But when it strikes,
it leaves a blue mark behind.

1175
02:28:42,120 --> 02:28:47,200
And when it strikes again,
it peels ofthe skin.

1176
02:28:49,399 --> 02:28:50,440
Tell me, who was it?

1177
02:28:52,479 --> 02:28:55,800
Tell me, who gave you
all the information?

1178
02:29:08,559 --> 02:29:11,920
Mr Ravi, why don't you
make him see reason?

1179
02:29:16,520 --> 02:29:22,160
You haven't understood us. l won't
ask any questions just to save myself.

1180
02:29:22,280 --> 02:29:27,360
Nor Vijay will answer such
stupid questions to save his life.

1181
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:28,720
Oh really?

1182
02:29:31,440 --> 02:29:38,240
Fine. Ifyou are obstinate,
then l am too.

1183
02:29:40,440 --> 02:29:41,440
Who was it?

1184
02:29:44,120 --> 02:29:46,040
Who was it?

1185
02:29:49,159 --> 02:29:52,520
Who was it?
- Was? He still is.

1186
02:29:52,639 --> 02:29:54,960
But, l won't tell you.

1187
02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:03,800
Stop! Please!

1188
02:30:16,120 --> 02:30:23,240
Vijay, you can endure the lashes.
But, you can't stand the lashes...

1189
02:30:23,360 --> 02:30:27,720
...which scathes your
Iover's tender skin.

1190
02:30:28,639 --> 02:30:33,120
Daaga, l'll...
- l want the informer's name.

1191
02:30:34,120 --> 02:30:37,400
l will never tell you that.
Come what may, l won't.

1192
02:30:40,360 --> 02:30:44,800
All right, then.
Anything can happen.

1193
02:30:52,280 --> 02:30:55,560
Sylvia? You?
- Don't move, Daaga.

1194
02:30:55,680 --> 02:31:00,000
Have you gone mad?
- Your luck is bad.

1195
02:31:01,639 --> 02:31:05,640
l have called Tony.
The police is on the way.

1196
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:09,200
Drop the whip.

1197
02:31:14,120 --> 02:31:15,320
Untie Sheetal first.

1198
02:31:18,079 --> 02:31:23,840
Tell your men not to move.
Ifthey did, l'll shoot you.

1199
02:31:33,479 --> 02:31:37,600
Sylvia, keep a watch on
eveyone. Sheetal, untie us.

1200
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:43,160
So, you are the one? The
informer.

1201
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:48,600
Yes, Daaga. It was me.
l gave all information to Vijay.

1202
02:31:48,719 --> 02:31:53,840
And it was you, who had given
orders to kill my sister Teresa.

1203
02:31:53,959 --> 02:32:01,680
lt was because ofyou that Tony
and Teresa's son is maimed for life.

1204
02:32:03,879 --> 02:32:07,880
And it was for you...
that l and Tony swore...

1205
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:12,480
...to take you to the gallows
someday.

1206
02:32:13,760 --> 02:32:17,440
l understand now.
- Too late.

1207
02:32:18,120 --> 02:32:23,640
lt's never too late. l keep girls
like you in my pockets.

1208
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:28,560
Ty to remove your hands,
and l'll fire.

1209
02:33:04,120 --> 02:33:07,960
You are hit in the arm.
Nothing to wory. You'll be fine.

1210
02:33:14,719 --> 02:33:18,280
Who are you? What do you
want?- l am Tony.

1211
02:33:20,719 --> 02:33:23,440
l want to send you offto your
destination now.

1212
02:33:26,079 --> 02:33:29,320
You are surely mistaken.

1213
02:33:29,440 --> 02:33:35,880
No, Daaga. l can't mistake
identities of my wife's killers.

1214
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:44,840
Don't move. Else, l wouldn't
mind to shoot you down.

1215
02:33:54,079 --> 02:33:56,240
Now what?
- Balwant is waiting...

1216
02:33:56,360 --> 02:33:58,480
...at the flying club at Goa Road.
Lets' hury.

1217
02:34:22,959 --> 02:34:24,480
What happened? Where are
they?

1218
02:34:26,280 --> 02:34:32,400
Make it fast. Time is running out.
The flying club... Goa Road.

1219
02:34:35,840 --> 02:34:37,880
But, you...
- Don't wory about me.

1220
02:34:40,280 --> 02:34:44,480
Today l have given you
the final information.

1221
02:34:46,680 --> 02:34:50,600
But l am quoting
a vey high price for it.

1222
02:34:50,719 --> 02:34:52,840
Will you give me?
- Tell me, Tony.

1223
02:34:55,000 --> 02:35:03,960
Take care ofJohnny. ARer me
he'll be leR to fend for himself.

1224
02:35:04,079 --> 02:35:06,760
Don't wory about your son.
l am there for him.

1225
02:35:06,879 --> 02:35:11,760
Can l do anything else for you?
- Yes. You can.

1226
02:35:11,879 --> 02:35:18,560
Don't let these dogs escape.

1227
02:35:20,239 --> 02:35:29,080
These killers killed my wife
and made my son...

1228
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:41,560
Yes, Vijay. Come on.

1229
02:35:43,239 --> 02:35:45,240
How long will it take?
-Final check-up of engine...

1230
02:35:45,360 --> 02:35:48,920
...is going on. We will leave
soon in a short while

1231
02:37:04,559 --> 02:37:05,360
Get hold of him.

1232
02:38:23,719 --> 02:38:24,880
He is tailing us.

1233
02:38:44,840 --> 02:38:46,760
We can't fly, Daaga.
There's a copter above.

1234
02:38:46,879 --> 02:38:48,920
And we can't even take a turn.
Vijay is in the van.

1235
02:38:53,719 --> 02:38:55,640
l am tying to take-off.

1236
02:39:00,959 --> 02:39:02,800
What happened?-lfthis plane
flies it will crash...

1237
02:39:02,920 --> 02:39:04,680
...with the helicopter,
Mr. Daaga.

1238
02:39:05,200 --> 02:39:06,720
Our way is blocked in
the ground too.

1239
02:39:40,879 --> 02:39:42,880
l can't run.
l sprained my leg.

1240
02:40:22,079 --> 02:40:25,920
l am ready to pay you any price
to get away from here.

1241
02:40:26,040 --> 02:40:28,920
Can you pay the price for countless
number of innocent people?

1242
02:40:29,040 --> 02:40:33,600
Yes, Vijay. l am ready
to pay any price.

1243
02:40:33,719 --> 02:40:36,080
Can you pay the price
for Tony's blood?

1244
02:40:38,159 --> 02:40:43,400
l can finish you now but l don't
want to take law in my hands.

1245
02:40:45,280 --> 02:40:55,200
l arrest you, Daaga.-All right,
Vijay. l lose, you win.

1246
02:40:57,360 --> 02:41:04,280
l am willing to come along
with you.

1247
02:41:17,440 --> 02:41:21,680
''There's no one quite like us
in the city...''

1248
02:41:23,639 --> 02:41:28,440
''no one else possesses the fire''

1249
02:41:29,719 --> 02:41:33,960
''Send for me
whenever you need me...''

1250
02:41:34,079 --> 02:41:42,960
''if you have any doubts,
put me to test''
