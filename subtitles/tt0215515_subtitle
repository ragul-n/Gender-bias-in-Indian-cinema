1
00:08:55,214 --> 00:08:59,220
I want to see a smile on
my mother's face again.

2
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:06,692
What sacrifice will you make?
- My life.

3
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:07,227
And?

4
00:09:09,227 --> 00:09:10,163
What else do I have?

5
00:09:11,163 --> 00:09:14,168
You do. Will you be
able to give it to me?

6
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:17,171
What?
- Devotion.

7
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:24,178
Devotion?
- Yes, the devotion of Motherland.

8
00:09:26,178 --> 00:09:27,182
Devotion?

9
00:09:30,182 --> 00:09:32,187
The devotion of Motherland?

10
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:37,658
In India, the first battle
of freedom was not fought in 1857. . .

11
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:42,196
but 20 years after
the battle of Palasi. . .

12
00:09:43,196 --> 00:09:49,202
where the British wiped out truth and
tried to defame us in the whole world.

13
00:09:50,202 --> 00:09:53,206
The great battle of
freedom of 1857. . .

14
00:09:54,206 --> 00:09:56,210
has been shown as purely a mutiny.

15
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:02,315
Bankim Chandra wrote Anand Math. . .

16
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:04,217
based on our
first struggle for freedom.

17
00:10:05,217 --> 00:10:10,157
The British labeled the sages
as looters.

18
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:13,162
But can truth ever be concealed?

19
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:17,166
Year 1 7 7 0.

20
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:25,171
During this period,
in a part of India. . .

21
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:27,173
there was such a severe drought. . .

22
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:31,178
whose example cannot be
found in world's history.

23
00:10:33,178 --> 00:10:40,188
Lack of food, and epidemics
killed half the population.

24
00:10:43,188 --> 00:10:52,198
Those who survived, forget humans,
they lived even worst than animals.

25
00:10:53,198 --> 00:10:54,203
They just lived.

26
00:10:58,203 --> 00:11:05,212
Where you could not get a handful of
grains even if you sold your women. . .

27
00:11:07,212 --> 00:11:09,150
how could anyone pay taxes there?

28
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,154
But taxes had to be paid.

29
00:11:16,154 --> 00:11:18,158
Because, thanks to traitors. . .

30
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:21,226
the traders of
East India Company. . .

31
00:11:21,226 --> 00:11:23,163
had become the collectors
of land revenue.

32
00:11:25,163 --> 00:11:27,167
Why would they give up taxes?

33
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:33,239
Sir.
- How much money does they owe us?

34
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:35,176
Rs. 6606.

35
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:39,178
They owe us so much money?
- So much?

36
00:11:40,178 --> 00:11:46,186
Where are your people? Why are
they not here to give the money?

37
00:11:47,186 --> 00:11:50,190
Due to drought and epidemic,
everyone has run away.

38
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:56,200
Hurry up!
Close that door and window.

39
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,203
Everyone has run away, huh?

40
00:12:05,203 --> 00:12:06,144
Go, present them!

41
00:12:12,144 --> 00:12:13,163
No!

42
00:12:31,163 --> 00:12:32,195
Spare us!

43
00:13:03,195 --> 00:13:05,140
My son ! where had you gone?

44
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,192
Beat them!

45
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:12,599
He is the Nawab( ruler). In deed,
he should protect the people.

46
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:16,135
But as a fact, he is a mere puppet
in the hands of the British.

47
00:14:17,135 --> 00:14:20,123
Lost in merriment,
where was he aware of the world?

48
00:15:11,123 --> 00:15:15,128
' O bartender, serve liquor
in my party'

49
00:15:16,128 --> 00:15:19,131
' If tragedy strikes, let it'

50
00:15:20,131 --> 00:15:24,202
' Serve. . .serve me more'

51
00:15:24,202 --> 00:15:28,142
' If the liquor overflows,
let it overflow'

52
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:32,144
He's King Mahendra Singh.

53
00:15:33,144 --> 00:15:38,152
It is said he was the richest
among the kings of Bengal.

54
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:41,159
But today. . .

55
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:55,169
God, don't be angry.
You are always with us.

56
00:15:58,169 --> 00:15:59,181
Yes?

57
00:16:09,181 --> 00:16:11,116
What are you hiding, Kalyani?

58
00:16:11,116 --> 00:16:16,855
Like you have taken something to
protect you, even I. . .

59
00:16:16,855 --> 00:16:20,130
What is that?
- A woman's last resort.

60
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:28,605
Come, child. Let's go.

61
00:16:33,605 --> 00:16:38,144
Today, this grand mansion,
the ancestral wealth. . .

62
00:16:39,144 --> 00:16:44,152
grandeur, prestige, wealth, money,
they are forced to leave all and go.

63
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:49,157
There was not a drop of
milk for the baby in the palace.

64
00:16:51,157 --> 00:16:56,186
King and beggar, all became one.

65
00:17:21,186 --> 00:17:25,257
Look! that's a house?
- It is.

66
00:17:25,257 --> 00:17:26,673
Come, let's go.

67
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:43,211
Kalyani, we can
spend the night here.

68
00:17:46,211 --> 00:17:49,218
You sit here.

69
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:53,223
I'll come back soon.

70
00:17:58,223 --> 00:18:02,827
Where are you going?
- To get some milk for the baby.

71
00:18:02,827 --> 00:18:06,690
Where can I get milk here?
- Don't worry, I'll be back soon.

72
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,693
Hail Mother Kali !

73
00:19:08,693 --> 00:19:10,676
Hail Mother Kali !

74
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:29,181
Take, eat! Fill your stomach !

75
00:19:29,181 --> 00:19:30,184
Idiot!

76
00:19:33,184 --> 00:19:36,192
You bloody chief! You beat me?

77
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:42,194
We supported you, and you beat me?

78
00:19:43,194 --> 00:19:44,166
Beat him!

79
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,769
- She's gone!
- Where?

80
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:27,631
She'll be close by.
Where can she go? Go find her!

81
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:27,175
Don't cry, baby.

82
00:21:37,175 --> 00:21:40,195
''O Lord ! ''

83
00:23:04,195 --> 00:23:08,140
Get up. . .get up, my child.

84
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:27,246
Child, I forgot to ask you.
Where is your home?

85
00:24:27,246 --> 00:24:32,152
There is no one left here
except King Mahendra Singh.

86
00:24:34,152 --> 00:24:40,163
Oh. So are you
King Mahendra Singh's wife?

87
00:24:45,163 --> 00:24:49,182
Don't worry, you will
meet Mahendra Singh soon.

88
00:25:04,182 --> 00:25:10,124
You seem to be ready.
- We are leaving.

89
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:14,134
And news on Mahendra Singh?
- No.

90
00:25:23,134 --> 00:25:27,140
Will you manage all this alone?
- Yes.

91
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,142
Okay.

92
00:25:30,142 --> 00:25:36,148
Find Mahendra.
And if possible, bring him along.

93
00:25:37,148 --> 00:25:39,155
As you wish.
- May victory be yours.

94
00:25:44,155 --> 00:25:48,162
Let me go.
- Shut-up!

95
00:25:50,162 --> 00:25:53,165
Sir, we have caught this bandit.
This gun was in his hand.

96
00:25:54,165 --> 00:25:57,169
Where did you get this gun from?
- From my ancestors.

97
00:25:57,169 --> 00:26:00,173
Not one, I have thousands.
- You're talking rubbish? Quiet!

98
00:26:01,173 --> 00:26:03,175
Sir, order me,
what should I do with him?

99
00:26:04,175 --> 00:26:07,180
Right. What do you do with him?

100
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:17,126
Just dump him.

101
00:26:22,126 --> 00:26:25,136
Take him into custody for now.
We'll deal with him later.

102
00:26:32,136 --> 00:26:35,142
Listen to me.
You are making a mistake.

103
00:26:37,142 --> 00:26:40,648
I am innocent.
Listen to me.

104
00:26:44,648 --> 00:26:49,253
Sir, he beat an officer.
- Put him in the other cart.

105
00:26:49,253 --> 00:26:52,223
I'm a mendicant, sir.
They are mistaken.

106
00:26:52,223 --> 00:26:54,226
Shut-up!
- Listen to me.

107
00:26:54,226 --> 00:26:58,171
Shut-up! Take him.
Put him in the cart.

108
00:27:06,171 --> 00:27:09,215
Look! they are coming.

109
00:27:51,215 --> 00:27:52,676
Mahendra Singh, don't run away.

110
00:28:18,676 --> 00:28:20,683
Hiranand, keep fighting,
I'll be back.

111
00:28:25,683 --> 00:28:28,286
You are watching the scene
with a sword in hand?

112
00:28:28,286 --> 00:28:29,354
Yes.

113
00:28:29,354 --> 00:28:32,656
Are you a prince or a coward?
- Maybe I am.

114
00:28:32,656 --> 00:28:34,259
But I cannot loot like you people.

115
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:38,262
These bandits have helped you.
- Thanks, but I don't want such help.

116
00:28:38,262 --> 00:28:41,266
Good. Stand back and
watch the scene.

117
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:44,202
These bandits want to unite
you with the queen and prince.

118
00:28:44,202 --> 00:28:46,204
Listen !
- Yes?

119
00:28:47,204 --> 00:28:49,211
Atleast tell me
who you really are.

120
00:28:54,211 --> 00:28:58,217
Santan ( children )
- Santan? I don't understand.

121
00:28:59,217 --> 00:29:01,318
Whose children?
- Mothers'.

122
00:29:01,318 --> 00:29:03,221
Mother's?
- Yes.

123
00:29:04,221 --> 00:29:08,166
' Motherland is greater than heaven'

124
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:17,170
I bow to thee!
- O'Mother!

125
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:23,174
So you want to serve
your Motherland by looting?

126
00:29:24,174 --> 00:29:26,176
No.
- Then what's going on?

127
00:29:26,176 --> 00:29:28,179
We are looting the loot from looters.

128
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:30,184
But this is the king's tax.
- The king's?

129
00:29:34,184 --> 00:29:37,200
Who king?
- Nawab Mir Zafar.

130
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,205
In whose kingdom, to pay taxes,
people have to sell their women.

131
00:29:55,205 --> 00:29:59,211
In whose estate, people have
to eat the dead to survive.

132
00:30:00,211 --> 00:30:03,213
Under whose rule,
government officers. . .

133
00:30:03,213 --> 00:30:06,718
blatantly disgrace
the honor of our women.

134
00:30:06,718 --> 00:30:09,155
Mir Zafar!
That same Mir Zafar. . .

135
00:30:11,155 --> 00:30:14,224
who has handed over the country's
wealth to foreign looters. . .

136
00:30:14,224 --> 00:30:15,161
and himself lives in peace.

137
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:21,166
Who watches his women folk being
disgraced by foreigners and smiles.

138
00:30:22,166 --> 00:30:26,237
But what can we do?
- We? We can kick them out.

139
00:30:26,237 --> 00:30:29,174
Who will do it?
These handful of Santan?

140
00:30:30,174 --> 00:30:33,178
How many Britishers were
there in the Palasi battle?

141
00:30:33,178 --> 00:30:35,181
The question is not how many
fighters there are. . .

142
00:30:36,181 --> 00:30:39,184
but their dedication
to do or die.

143
00:30:40,184 --> 00:30:45,256
In this battle of freedom, we
Santan believe only in one power.

144
00:30:45,256 --> 00:30:48,660
The power of celibacy.

145
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,195
If we can maintain celibacy. . .

146
00:30:51,195 --> 00:30:55,201
our handful of men can make
the people fight the British.

147
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:59,269
Don't you have families?

148
00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:02,272
Yes, we do.
- You have given them up?

149
00:31:02,272 --> 00:31:04,210
No, we are keeping our promise.

150
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,310
Will you join us?

151
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:09,713
If staying away from your wife and
children is your promise. . .

152
00:31:09,713 --> 00:31:11,653
I will not be able to do it.

153
00:31:14,653 --> 00:31:21,157
I bow to thee!
- O'Mother

154
00:34:40,157 --> 00:34:43,161
What are you looking?
- Lord Vishnu.

155
00:34:44,161 --> 00:34:48,168
Vishnu. And what's in his lap?

156
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:53,172
Who is she?
- Mother.

157
00:34:54,172 --> 00:34:59,277
Mother?
- Yes, our mother.

158
00:34:59,277 --> 00:35:04,182
I don't understand.
- You will, when the time comes.

159
00:35:05,182 --> 00:35:06,135
Come.

160
00:35:25,135 --> 00:35:30,144
Salute your Motherland.

161
00:35:34,144 --> 00:35:37,150
See. . . look. . .

162
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:43,253
the way Mother is.

163
00:35:43,253 --> 00:35:51,164
Great, dark, awe inspiring.

164
00:35:53,164 --> 00:35:56,168
Today, our country
has become a graveyard.

165
00:35:57,168 --> 00:36:00,179
That is why Mother is
wearing this garland of skulls.

166
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:10,119
Come.

167
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:20,126
See. . . look. . .

168
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:25,132
as Mother will be.

169
00:36:28,132 --> 00:36:29,134
Saw?

170
00:36:30,134 --> 00:36:33,139
Look at her hands.

171
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:39,646
Different weapons of power
in different hands.

172
00:36:41,646 --> 00:36:45,650
With fiends at her feet.

173
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:49,157
She is lost in power.

174
00:36:53,157 --> 00:37:00,164
Divine power. . .

175
00:37:01,164 --> 00:37:03,168
eliminator of sorrow. . .

176
00:37:04,168 --> 00:37:06,170
eliminator of enemies. . .

177
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:10,175
O Mother!
Mother, I bow to thee!

178
00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:13,184
Mother, I bow to thee!
- Mother, I bow to thee!

179
00:37:20,184 --> 00:37:23,188
When will we see
Mother in this form?

180
00:37:25,188 --> 00:37:30,197
When Mother's children
will call her Mother.

181
00:37:33,197 --> 00:37:36,202
Gurudev, where are
Kalyani and my daughter?

182
00:37:39,202 --> 00:37:44,307
Go straight from here.
You'll find them in the temple.

183
00:37:44,307 --> 00:37:48,713
I'll come back.

184
00:37:48,713 --> 00:37:53,219
Gurudev, I'll be back. I'll
take the oath. I'm coming back.

185
00:37:56,219 --> 00:37:59,224
You are having a good time.

186
00:38:00,224 --> 00:38:03,231
That sage army killed
a British officer.

187
00:38:08,231 --> 00:38:09,172
You bloody Nawab!

188
00:38:15,172 --> 00:38:19,177
Tell me, what compensation
can you give?

189
00:38:20,177 --> 00:38:24,182
It's okay, sir. What is
there to get so angry about?

190
00:38:25,182 --> 00:38:29,193
Take Rs. 200000 more in taxes.

191
00:38:35,193 --> 00:38:37,195
We made you the Nawab.

192
00:38:38,195 --> 00:38:41,199
If you don't
maintain law and order. . .

193
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:45,708
we will dump you.

194
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:54,311
We want peace.

195
00:38:54,311 --> 00:38:58,217
Give me one more chance, sir.

196
00:39:00,217 --> 00:39:03,222
I'm sending the orders
right now.

197
00:39:04,222 --> 00:39:09,663
Santan ( sages ) will
either be caught, or killed.

198
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:50,668
' Let there be
rejoicing in my party'

199
00:39:51,668 --> 00:39:55,206
' The state of the people
of the world is bad'

200
00:39:56,206 --> 00:39:59,211
' Give me liquor,
my nights are young'

201
00:40:01,211 --> 00:40:05,217
' Serve me, serve me more'

202
00:40:06,217 --> 00:40:10,157
' If the liquor overflows,
let it overflow'

203
00:40:14,157 --> 00:40:18,163
God's universe,
the kingdom of the king.

204
00:40:19,163 --> 00:40:24,235
The order is
from Nawab Mir Zafar. . .

205
00:40:24,235 --> 00:40:28,172
the Nawab of Bengal.

206
00:40:29,172 --> 00:40:32,175
Every man, ordinary and
special is being informed. . .

207
00:40:32,175 --> 00:40:36,181
that hereafter,
as per the king's orders. . .

208
00:40:37,181 --> 00:40:41,818
that the sages, due to
their rebellious activities. . .

209
00:40:41,818 --> 00:40:44,188
have been declared culprits.

210
00:40:45,188 --> 00:40:48,192
Therefore, it becomes
the duty of every man. . .

211
00:40:48,192 --> 00:40:50,260
that wherever he
comes across them. . .

212
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,663
he must get them arrested.

213
00:40:52,663 --> 00:40:58,204
Whoever goes against this order
will be punished severely.

214
00:41:01,204 --> 00:41:02,208
Mother, I bow to thee!

215
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:08,213
Catch him! The rascal !

216
00:41:09,213 --> 00:41:10,625
Make him mute!

217
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:27,164
Whoever goes against this order
will be punished severely.

218
00:41:28,164 --> 00:41:31,235
Have you sent this message
to all our branches?

219
00:41:31,235 --> 00:41:34,172
Yes. I sent Devanand
and Gyananad right away.

220
00:41:35,172 --> 00:41:39,179
Everyone has become alert, so that
no Santan gets arrested by the enemy.

221
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:43,182
What is it?

222
00:41:46,182 --> 00:41:49,186
King Mahendra is leaving the
Math( Home ) with his wife and child.

223
00:41:50,186 --> 00:41:51,188
Shall I stop them?
- No.

224
00:41:52,188 --> 00:41:54,925
But Gurudev?
- He is aware.

225
00:41:55,925 --> 00:41:57,144
He has to take
this burden himself.

226
00:42:14,144 --> 00:42:16,634
Did someone call?
- No.

227
00:42:36,634 --> 00:42:40,237
Coming !
- Wait! Where are you going?

228
00:42:40,237 --> 00:42:44,275
Where are you going?
- That call ! that same call.

229
00:42:44,275 --> 00:42:46,182
Whose call? I did not hear it.

230
00:42:52,182 --> 00:42:54,186
You didn't?
- No.

231
00:42:55,186 --> 00:42:58,190
Then maybe I'm mistaken.
- Mistaken? What mistake?

232
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:02,793
It's nothing, Kalyani.
- There is something.

233
00:43:02,793 --> 00:43:04,195
Tell me.

234
00:43:05,195 --> 00:43:08,135
Gurudev showed me Mother's
idol in the Math.

235
00:43:11,135 --> 00:43:15,139
Mother is very inspiring.
Her eyes draw you to her.

236
00:43:16,139 --> 00:43:19,643
It feels like she is
calling again and again.

237
00:43:20,643 --> 00:43:23,148
I don't want to hear that call.

238
00:43:24,148 --> 00:43:29,154
Mother is calling you.
Don't avoid this call.

239
00:43:30,154 --> 00:43:32,157
Not to avoid it?

240
00:43:33,157 --> 00:43:36,161
You have to surrender
everything at Mother's feet.

241
00:43:37,161 --> 00:43:39,164
What are you saying, Kalyani !

242
00:43:41,164 --> 00:43:44,170
I saw her in my
dream yesterday.

243
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:48,172
Seeing me, she said. . .

244
00:43:49,172 --> 00:43:55,179
' she is the one who is
snatching my son from me'

245
00:43:56,179 --> 00:44:00,284
Look, she is calling me.

246
00:44:00,284 --> 00:44:05,190
Kalyani, it is just a dream.
Let's go from here.

247
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:07,657
Where?
- Home.

248
00:44:07,657 --> 00:44:09,128
Home?
- Yes.

249
00:44:12,128 --> 00:44:17,201
The path that Motherland is
showing you, take that.

250
00:44:17,201 --> 00:44:20,605
You go.
- Are our paths separate, Kalyani?

251
00:44:21,605 --> 00:44:31,748
I have reached my destination.
- Kalyani ! What are you doing !

252
00:44:31,748 --> 00:44:33,152
You decided to
separate from me?

253
00:44:35,152 --> 00:44:40,159
No! I won't be able to leave you.
I don't want to leave you and die.

254
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:48,175
Our path is one, our destination
is one. Isn't it, Kalyani?

255
00:44:59,175 --> 00:45:01,681
What happened, child?
Why are you crying?

256
00:45:03,681 --> 00:45:07,119
Listen !
- What happened?

257
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:13,125
My child. . . .
- She ate the poison.

258
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:19,141
Child, open your eyes.

259
00:45:32,141 --> 00:45:35,150
Kalyani ! What have you done!

260
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:49,161
I didn't want to leave you.

261
00:45:52,161 --> 00:45:57,172
My eyes are closing.

262
00:46:03,172 --> 00:46:05,126
Why did you do this, Kalyani?

263
00:46:23,126 --> 00:46:25,130
Here that?

264
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:31,603
Hail the Lord !

265
00:46:33,603 --> 00:46:37,143
Say it. . .say it.

266
00:46:40,143 --> 00:46:41,150
Say it.

267
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:50,190
Hail the Lord !

268
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:28,192
You bloody man !

269
00:47:28,192 --> 00:47:32,197
Leave him!
Arrest both of them!

270
00:47:33,197 --> 00:47:34,201
Come!

271
00:47:37,201 --> 00:47:41,206
Walk fast!

272
00:47:43,206 --> 00:47:45,211
Move faster!

273
00:47:48,211 --> 00:47:53,217
Gurudev, I don't understand
why you got arrested like that.

274
00:47:54,217 --> 00:47:58,222
And why are you taking beatings by
these dogs who're fed by the foreigners

275
00:47:59,222 --> 00:48:02,626
Why are you quiet?
What is the secret?

276
00:48:02,626 --> 00:48:06,231
You'll know the secret,
let the time come.

277
00:48:07,231 --> 00:48:09,170
Move, you traitor!

278
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:19,677
Officer, it is dusk.
If you permit, may I sing hymns?

279
00:48:19,677 --> 00:48:21,179
Hymns?

280
00:48:23,179 --> 00:48:26,282
So you are a sage?

281
00:48:26,282 --> 00:48:31,188
Constable, stop!
- What happened?

282
00:48:32,188 --> 00:48:36,195
Officer, I want to
pray for some time.

283
00:48:38,195 --> 00:48:41,199
He got angry.
- What is there to get angry about?

284
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:44,668
But sing something nice.

285
00:48:45,668 --> 00:48:50,221
Sing.
- Sing, you bloody rogue!

286
00:49:04,221 --> 00:49:10,626
' Slowly moved along
the river stream'

287
00:49:10,626 --> 00:49:14,181
' A woman'

288
00:49:31,181 --> 00:49:33,784
This is a message.
- From Gurudev?

289
00:49:33,784 --> 00:49:34,190
Yes.

290
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:44,713
How did this happen?
I'll call out.

291
00:50:02,713 --> 00:50:07,719
' Near the river bank,
lies a lady'

292
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:12,222
Lady near a river?

293
00:50:12,222 --> 00:50:14,159
There is surely someone
lying at the river bank.

294
00:50:15,159 --> 00:50:17,177
You go back to the Math.

295
00:51:41,177 --> 00:51:43,181
Mother, I bow to thee!

296
00:51:44,181 --> 00:51:47,284
Where are you going?
- To the city, to get news on Gurudev.

297
00:51:47,284 --> 00:51:49,286
Gurudev has been arrested.
- What?

298
00:51:49,286 --> 00:51:52,188
Yes. I got his message and
picked this child from the river. . .

299
00:51:52,188 --> 00:51:55,259
but her mother is lying there.
Go and cremate her.

300
00:51:55,259 --> 00:51:58,195
But what about Gurudev?
- Bhavanand has gone to the Math.

301
00:51:58,195 --> 00:52:00,197
I'll drop this kid
and come there.

302
00:52:00,197 --> 00:52:01,202
You also come there.
- Okay.

303
00:52:05,202 --> 00:52:09,135
Jivanand, where?
- Over here, at the turning.

304
00:53:12,135 --> 00:53:14,137
Coming !
- Come soon.

305
00:53:15,137 --> 00:53:17,139
What is it, sister-in-law?
Finished writing the poem?

306
00:53:17,139 --> 00:53:20,152
Yes.
- Wait I'll recite it.

307
00:53:29,152 --> 00:53:31,159
It's windy. I'll light the lamp.
- Don't bother.

308
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:41,164
''Monsoon in my eyes,
autumn in my heart''

309
00:53:42,164 --> 00:53:46,170

00:55:51,161 --> 00:55:57,300
''I roamed crazy''

321
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:01,173
''But I lost my beloved''

322
00:56:04,173 --> 00:56:09,112
''Like a bird I fly''

323
00:56:10,112 --> 00:56:13,121

that surrounded the whole country''

''It was the call for freedom''

335
00:59:04,219 --> 00:59:05,222
Coming !

336
00:59:07,222 --> 00:59:12,635
''Breaking the mountains on
the way ran out the stream''

337
00:59:19,635 --> 00:59:20,193
Glory!

338
00:59:44,193 --> 00:59:47,197
Before leaving,
I wanted to tell you. . .

339
00:59:48,197 --> 00:59:49,670
but then I thought. . .

340
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:58,208
Would I stop you from
doing this good work?

341
00:59:59,208 --> 00:59:59,419
Never.

342
01:00:02,211 --> 01:00:06,217
But before leaving. . .

343
01:00:08,217 --> 01:00:12,155
We will unite again, Shanti.
As soon as the war is over. . .

344
01:00:12,155 --> 01:00:13,159
I'll come back to my Shanti.

345
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:18,163
Shall I leave?

346
01:00:20,163 --> 01:00:24,170
Yes. I'll wait for you.

347
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:30,177
You are getting late.
Answer the call.

348
01:00:34,177 --> 01:00:39,197
Mother, I bow to thee!

349
01:00:55,197 --> 01:00:56,202
Brother, you !

350
01:00:59,202 --> 01:01:00,204
This. . .
- Move!

351
01:01:02,204 --> 01:01:03,146
What is this?

352
01:01:10,146 --> 01:01:12,748
Where did you bring her from?
Is she your child?

353
01:01:12,748 --> 01:01:15,251
Have you married again?
- I'll slap you !

354
01:01:15,251 --> 01:01:18,155
Is there milk in the house?
Feed her.

355
01:01:19,155 --> 01:01:21,157
Take care of her, I'm leaving.

356
01:01:21,157 --> 01:01:24,628
Brother, what is this?
You are leaving? Eat something.

357
01:01:25,628 --> 01:01:27,164
You have my promise.

358
01:01:29,164 --> 01:01:31,168
You have the same old habit.
You give a promise for everything.

359
01:01:33,168 --> 01:01:35,177
Good girl. Drink the milk.

360
01:01:42,177 --> 01:01:46,282
Brother, will you heed me?
- What?

361
01:01:46,282 --> 01:01:49,188
Will you really?
- Tell me.

362
01:01:52,188 --> 01:01:55,190
You have my promise, don't refuse.
- Promise again?

363
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:58,195
Will you tell me now?
- Shall I call?

364
01:01:59,195 --> 01:02:01,664
Shall I call once?
- Who?

365
01:02:01,664 --> 01:02:02,204
Sister-in-law.

366
01:02:09,204 --> 01:02:10,141
Brother!

367
01:02:13,141 --> 01:02:16,148
Brother, you have my promise. Don't
leave without meeting sister-in-law.

368
01:02:20,148 --> 01:02:23,152
Brother!
- I'll never step in this house again.

369
01:02:24,152 --> 01:02:27,155
Brother, you have
my husband's promise.

370
01:02:27,155 --> 01:02:29,157
Move aside, Nimmi !
- No!

371
01:02:29,157 --> 01:02:31,159
Move, or I'll kill you !

372
01:02:31,159 --> 01:02:35,166
You are very brave! You will kill
a woman, you will sacrifice a woman.

373
01:02:37,166 --> 01:02:39,168
Move aside, Nimmi !
- Sister-in-law!

374
01:02:40,168 --> 01:02:47,179
Shanti, go away!
Shanti, go away!

375
01:02:50,179 --> 01:02:54,184
Take an oath that you will remain
celibate by heart, deed and word.

376
01:02:56,184 --> 01:03:00,144
To the extent that you will not even
share the same chair with your wife.

377
01:03:22,144 --> 01:03:24,148
Look at your state.

378
01:03:26,148 --> 01:03:28,251
Don't you have enough money
even for food and clothes?

379
01:03:28,251 --> 01:03:29,157
Not at all.

380
01:03:34,157 --> 01:03:41,164
When you return and cremate me. . .

381
01:03:42,164 --> 01:03:46,170
Shanti, have I given you up?
- No, not given up.

382
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:51,273
When your oath is fulfilled,
when the country becomes free. . .

383
01:03:51,273 --> 01:03:53,177
when you return to me. . .

384
01:03:55,177 --> 01:04:01,184
Shanti, I often think that the
world I cannot imagine without you. . .

385
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:03,186
for it, I had to leave you.

386
01:04:04,186 --> 01:04:08,192
I don't know how to
leave you and go now.

387
01:04:09,192 --> 01:04:12,128
Why did we meet, Shanti?

388
01:04:13,128 --> 01:04:14,197
Why did we?

389
01:04:14,197 --> 01:04:21,137
Did your oath break
with this union?

390
01:04:22,137 --> 01:04:23,141
Did your oath break?

391
01:04:25,141 --> 01:04:29,146
There is penance.
And then, where does our life matter?

392
01:04:30,146 --> 01:04:34,150
Penance. . . penance.

393
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:40,222
Nothing much, just some charity,
taking a dip in the Ganga, prayer. . .

394
01:04:40,222 --> 01:04:48,168
I understand. But this
penance can be done only once?

395
01:04:52,168 --> 01:04:55,172
It is so difficult.
- And necessary too.

396
01:04:56,172 --> 01:04:58,175
Why? You didn't commit any sin.

397
01:04:59,175 --> 01:05:01,177
I have.
- What?

398
01:05:01,177 --> 01:05:05,280
I have broken a rule. I will
have to do the penance as per rule.

399
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:11,121
Rule? Who. .who is he
who makes the rules?

400
01:05:13,121 --> 01:05:17,126
If ever I meet him, I'll surely
tell him his rule is wrong.

401
01:05:18,126 --> 01:05:20,130
It's absolutely wrong !
- No, it is absolutely right.

402
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:23,199
No, I won't let you
follow this rule.

403
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:25,141
I won't let you offer penance.
Never!

404
01:05:33,141 --> 01:05:36,146
Listen ! Before leaving,
promise me. . .

405
01:05:37,146 --> 01:05:40,150
you will not offer penance
without meeting me first.

406
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:45,221
You also promise me you
won't live in this state.

407
01:05:45,221 --> 01:05:47,157
These old clothes. .
- I won't wear them, I promise.

408
01:05:48,157 --> 01:05:49,159
Then even I promise. . .

409
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:52,168
Bye, Shanti.

410
01:06:00,168 --> 01:06:06,775
Is she your wife?
- No, a close relative.

411
01:06:06,775 --> 01:06:08,177
She will stay here now.
- That's okay.

412
01:06:09,177 --> 01:06:12,114
She is a little weak,
you'll have to take care of her.

413
01:06:12,114 --> 01:06:14,117
Don't worry, I'll
take good care of her.

414
01:06:15,117 --> 01:06:18,530
Don't worry about the money,
I'll come once in a way.

415
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:31,135
And yes, call the physician soon.
- Yes, I'm going.

416
01:06:33,135 --> 01:06:37,141
You will follow celibacy
by heart, word and deed.

417
01:06:39,141 --> 01:06:42,148
You will follow celibacy
by heart, word and deed.

418
01:06:45,148 --> 01:06:51,154
If you break the oath even once,
you will pay penance.

419
01:06:51,154 --> 01:06:55,161
And that penance will be, death !

420
01:06:59,161 --> 01:07:02,164
Scream! Scream more!
- Gurudev!

421
01:07:02,164 --> 01:07:05,175
Damn your Gurudev!
Even his turn will come.

422
01:07:12,175 --> 01:07:19,182
All right, but I want to know,
is your jail well protected?

423
01:07:20,182 --> 01:07:22,188
I mean, is it strong?

424
01:07:25,188 --> 01:07:29,257
Sir, we have posted the best
guards of my kingdom. . .

425
01:07:29,257 --> 01:07:37,266
inside and outside the jail
and asked them to be so alert. . .

426
01:07:37,266 --> 01:07:43,708
that for miles away, forget Santan,
no one can wander.

427
01:07:45,708 --> 01:07:52,215
Maid ! I want to give my English
friends the feel of heaven.

428
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,217
Get liquor!

429
01:07:55,217 --> 01:07:56,695
''Crazy bee! ''

430
01:08:06,695 --> 01:08:10,233
''There's a glass of liquor,
the hand of love''

431
01:08:10,233 --> 01:08:14,185
''The shadow of tresses,
and Friday night''

432
01:08:29,185 --> 01:08:33,256
''Every heart is target,
the times are mine''

433
01:08:33,256 --> 01:08:36,167
''Eyes meet eyes,
the weather is romantic''

434
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:25,179
''Forget the flowers,
O my beloved''

435
01:09:30,179 --> 01:09:33,202
''Make me yours''

436
01:09:53,202 --> 01:09:55,207
''Meet my eyes''

437
01:09:59,207 --> 01:10:03,162
''There is a song on the lips,
I want to celebrate''

438
01:10:20,162 --> 01:10:23,631
''It is a lovely night,
drink to a high''

439
01:10:23,631 --> 01:10:27,984
''You have to die one day,
live life''

440
01:10:41,984 --> 01:10:45,193
''Life is beautiful''

441
01:10:51,193 --> 01:10:54,662
''My heart is a glass,
my eyes are a bar''

442
01:10:54,662 --> 01:10:58,193
''I'm that bud that
makes the weather romantic''

443
01:11:57,193 --> 01:11:59,175
Mother, I bow to thee!

444
01:12:46,175 --> 01:12:50,279
Gurudev, I have understood
why you deliberately got arrested.

445
01:12:50,279 --> 01:12:52,182
You understood?
- Yes.

446
01:12:54,182 --> 01:12:58,188
Mahendra, this is Santan's
first test by fire.

447
01:12:59,188 --> 01:13:06,157
I wanted to see whether my Santan
could rise to the occasion or not.

448
01:13:35,157 --> 01:13:39,162
Come Mahendra.
- Glory to Gurudev!

449
01:13:41,162 --> 01:13:43,180
Pardon us, Gurudev.

450
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:00,118
Mother, I bow to thee!

451
01:15:10,118 --> 01:15:16,127
No! their lives have been taken.

452
01:15:18,127 --> 01:15:22,132
The enemy has hid behind cannons
like cowards and killed them.

453
01:15:24,132 --> 01:15:28,137
The cannons of the enemy
have killed them.

454
01:15:29,137 --> 01:15:33,144
But their death has opened our eyes.

455
01:15:35,144 --> 01:15:38,148
Their immortal soul
has given us the message. . .

456
01:15:39,148 --> 01:15:43,154
that to face the enemy,
even we must have cannons.

457
01:15:45,154 --> 01:15:49,224
The enemy, with the power
of explosives and cannons. . .

458
01:15:49,224 --> 01:15:52,163
wants to rule over our Motherland.

459
01:15:55,163 --> 01:16:02,172
It wants to target our mission
of freedom with its cannons.

460
01:16:04,172 --> 01:16:07,176
So even we will have to answer
fire with fire. . .

461
01:16:07,176 --> 01:16:11,212
and cannons with cannons.

462
01:16:11,212 --> 01:16:13,858
Even we want cannons!

463
01:16:22,858 --> 01:16:27,131
Freedom. . .freedom. . .

464
01:16:30,131 --> 01:16:32,136
from atrocity.

465
01:16:35,136 --> 01:16:39,143
Freedom from slavery.

466
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:44,646
That is our destination. And we
have to reach that destination.

467
01:16:45,646 --> 01:16:50,153
How, we don't care.

468
01:16:51,153 --> 01:16:58,159
I am sure you will agree
that whatever the path. . .

469
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:01,167
our aim is to reach destination.

470
01:17:06,167 --> 01:17:15,179
I will leave the Math in 1 /2 days.

471
01:17:17,179 --> 01:17:22,185
It is possible, that for a few
years, until I return. . .

472
01:17:23,185 --> 01:17:31,216
Bhavanand and Jivanand
will run this Math.

473
01:17:55,216 --> 01:18:00,288
Gurudev, we understand why
you are leaving. . .

474
01:18:00,288 --> 01:18:02,690
but how will you achieve your aim?

475
01:18:02,690 --> 01:18:05,229
I will roam the whole country.

476
01:18:07,229 --> 01:18:11,167
And choose the best artisans
and send them here.

477
01:18:12,167 --> 01:18:14,168
How will only artisans help?

478
01:18:14,168 --> 01:18:17,672
That is why Mother
sent Mahendra here.

479
01:18:17,672 --> 01:18:19,676
I am going to make
him take the oath.

480
01:18:20,676 --> 01:18:25,180
His palace will be our fort.

481
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:28,185
Our cannons will be made there.

482
01:18:30,185 --> 01:18:34,256
Jivanand, I gave you that signal.
- Yes, I did go to the river.

483
01:18:34,256 --> 01:18:39,194
The kid was crying.
I left her with my sister.

484
01:18:40,194 --> 01:18:43,671
And her mother?
- Bhavanand has cremated her.

485
01:18:49,671 --> 01:18:50,216
Okay.

486
01:19:01,216 --> 01:19:08,222
If any of you
has made any mistake. . .

487
01:19:08,222 --> 01:19:14,163
even unknowingly, don't
offer penance until I return.

488
01:19:16,163 --> 01:19:21,685
But, choose your own penance.

489
01:19:36,685 --> 01:19:45,193
Take an oath that you will
follow celibacy.

490
01:19:45,193 --> 01:19:48,199
I take the oath.
- I take. . .the oath.

491
01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:56,204
Until the country does
not become free. . .

492
01:19:57,204 --> 01:20:00,309
you will remain celibate
in heart, word, and deed.

493
01:20:00,309 --> 01:20:01,212
Yes.
- Yes.

494
01:20:04,212 --> 01:20:09,318
You will not even share
the same chair with your wife.

495
01:20:09,318 --> 01:20:10,154
Yes.
- Yes.

496
01:20:13,154 --> 01:20:16,625
Take an oath that you participate
in the war for freedom. . .

497
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:20,162
and fight till your last breath.

498
01:20:20,162 --> 01:20:23,164
I promise.
- I promise.

499
01:20:23,164 --> 01:20:30,173
Now promise that if you break even
one vow, you will atone for it.

500
01:20:32,173 --> 01:20:36,180
And that atonement will be death !

501
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:40,203
I promise.
- I promise.

502
01:21:02,203 --> 01:21:03,208
Touch it.

503
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:11,146
Say, glory to our Motherland !

504
01:21:12,146 --> 01:21:14,164
Mother, I bow to thee!

505
01:21:30,164 --> 01:21:33,176
Come. . .come.

506
01:21:42,176 --> 01:21:47,184
Seeing your young age,
I name you Nayanand.

507
01:21:49,184 --> 01:21:52,188
As you wish.
- What is your name?

508
01:21:53,188 --> 01:21:57,194
My name. . .
- Yes, tell me.

509
01:22:00,194 --> 01:22:03,201
Shanti Sharma.

510
01:22:06,201 --> 01:22:12,140
Why did you do this injustice?
Why? !

511
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:17,145
I have not done injustice.
- Isn't cheating injustice?

512
01:22:18,145 --> 01:22:21,149
Being a woman, isn't it injustice
to come in a monk Math?

513
01:22:21,149 --> 01:22:25,154
Yes, it is injustice,
if the intention is unjust.

514
01:22:26,154 --> 01:22:31,159
You only just said that whatever the
path, the aim is to reach destination.

515
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:39,634
Path. .destination. . .what is
your reason for coming here?

516
01:22:39,634 --> 01:22:42,770
Being besides my husband
and doing my duty.

517
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:46,175
This is not your place
to fulfill your duty.

518
01:22:47,175 --> 01:22:50,179
Your duty is to live in your
world, not here.

519
01:22:51,179 --> 01:22:55,184
Why not? Could Ram be Ram
without Sita, his wife?

520
01:22:56,184 --> 01:22:59,188
Would the Pandavs win the
Kurukshetra without Draupadi?

521
01:23:00,188 --> 01:23:03,192
You tell me, without Utara. . .
- Enough !

522
01:23:04,192 --> 01:23:09,139
Sita, Draupadi, Utara, Shanti. . .

523
01:23:17,139 --> 01:23:21,146
Are you Jivanand's wife, Shanti?

524
01:23:25,146 --> 01:23:32,154
Child, why did you come here?
You know he is my right hand.

525
01:23:33,154 --> 01:23:34,158
You have come to chop it?

526
01:23:37,158 --> 01:23:41,163
If he is Gurudev's right hand. . .

527
01:23:42,163 --> 01:23:43,170
it is not so easy to chop it.
- Tell me your reason for coming here.

528
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:53,675
Tell me quickly.
- I have two reasons.

529
01:23:53,675 --> 01:23:57,180
One, to tell you, that the
penance you ask for is wrong.

530
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:59,181
It's absolutely wrong !

531
01:24:00,181 --> 01:24:03,652
It is unfair to make someone pay
with his life for a small mistake.

532
01:24:03,652 --> 01:24:04,189
Shut-up!

533
01:24:08,189 --> 01:24:10,592
Tell me your other reason.

534
01:24:11,592 --> 01:24:16,131
My other reason is my husband,
who is your right hand. . .

535
01:24:17,131 --> 01:24:19,600
to save him from penance.

536
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,604
What did you say? !

537
01:24:23,604 --> 01:24:26,141
To save your right hand
from offering penance.

538
01:24:27,141 --> 01:24:30,645
Penance? By Jivanand?

539
01:24:30,645 --> 01:24:33,149
Why? What's his mistake?

540
01:24:35,149 --> 01:24:40,622
Yesterday, suddenly,
without any intention. . .

541
01:24:41,622 --> 01:24:43,158
he met me.

542
01:24:44,158 --> 01:24:46,627
That is his only mistake.

543
01:24:46,627 --> 01:24:52,168
Jivanand met you?
He broke his oath?

544
01:24:54,168 --> 01:24:56,637
Does he realise his mistake?

545
01:24:56,637 --> 01:25:01,127
Yes, he's aware of his mistake,
and his penance.

546
01:25:19,127 --> 01:25:25,135
Of his mistake, and his penance.

547
01:25:27,135 --> 01:25:28,643
His penance too.

548
01:25:34,643 --> 01:25:37,150
Mother! . . . Mother!

549
01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:46,161
What will happen now, Gurudev?

550
01:25:53,161 --> 01:25:59,168
Child, rule does not see
who the man is.

551
01:26:01,168 --> 01:26:04,173
And without rules,
no struggle can succeed.

552
01:26:06,173 --> 01:26:08,110
He will have to
atone for his mistake.

553
01:26:10,110 --> 01:26:12,113
And he will too.

554
01:26:13,113 --> 01:26:19,186
I know he will atone.
No one can stop him. No one.

555
01:26:19,186 --> 01:26:24,126
That is why I have come.
We must save him anyhow.

556
01:26:25,126 --> 01:26:30,131
He has made a mistake.
- Forgive him.

557
01:26:31,131 --> 01:26:32,135
That's impossible.

558
01:26:34,135 --> 01:26:38,140
Will all this be wasted?

559
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:46,149
There is no other way.
- No Gurudev! don't say that.

560
01:26:49,149 --> 01:26:54,155
Look at me once.
You will have to save him.

561
01:26:55,155 --> 01:26:57,626
You will have to save him.

562
01:26:58,626 --> 01:27:07,635
You have to accept that if I wished,
I would never let him come here.

563
01:27:07,635 --> 01:27:09,171
But I did not stop him.

564
01:27:10,171 --> 01:27:15,180
Was it for this? For this wrong
rule? Don't let this happen, Gurudev.

565
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:23,186
Give one chance,
just one chance.

566
01:27:26,186 --> 01:27:32,661
Okay, you don't do anything,
don't offer any solution. . .

567
01:27:33,661 --> 01:27:35,197
don't forgive him.

568
01:27:36,197 --> 01:27:38,201
You have addressed me as daughter.

569
01:27:40,201 --> 01:27:43,204
Accept your daughter's small request.

570
01:27:44,204 --> 01:27:46,207
Allow me to stay here.

571
01:27:46,207 --> 01:27:51,311
To stop him from offering penance
until suitable time. . .

572
01:27:51,311 --> 01:27:55,717
like until the battle,
allow me to stay here.

573
01:27:56,717 --> 01:28:01,224
I promise no one will recognise me.
Give your consent, Gurudev.

574
01:28:03,224 --> 01:28:06,694
Until you don't say yes,
I won't leave your feet.

575
01:28:07,694 --> 01:28:09,176
Gurudev, give consent.

576
01:28:22,176 --> 01:28:23,181
Get up.

577
01:28:27,181 --> 01:28:30,190
Go and wear your turban.

578
01:28:36,190 --> 01:28:42,158
Stay here. . .you will stay here.

579
01:29:10,158 --> 01:29:12,673
Arrange for my departure.

580
01:29:26,673 --> 01:29:28,176
Gurudev left the Math. . .

581
01:29:29,176 --> 01:29:33,182
to defeat the enemy, fire with
fire, cannon with cannon.

582
01:29:35,182 --> 01:29:38,186
Artisans were required
to make the cannons.

583
01:29:39,186 --> 01:29:41,655
Artisans picked from
all over the country.

584
01:29:41,655 --> 01:29:45,664
To pick them, Gurudev searched
every corner of the country.

585
01:29:50,664 --> 01:29:53,268
As soon as the artisans reached
the Math. . .

586
01:29:53,268 --> 01:29:57,206
King Mahendra, Jivanand and
Bhavanand started building the fort.

587
01:29:58,206 --> 01:30:01,309
To increase the army of Santan,
Jivanand and Bhavanand. . .

588
01:30:01,309 --> 01:30:03,712
started spreading the message
of devotion to Motherland.

589
01:30:04,712 --> 01:30:10,627
The fort was being constructed,
and also a workshop to make firearms.

590
01:30:19,627 --> 01:30:21,163
Jivanand would work day and night.

591
01:30:23,163 --> 01:30:28,170
To add more Santan to the army,
to get swords, shields and guns made. . .

592
01:30:29,170 --> 01:30:31,172
to train men.

593
01:30:32,172 --> 01:30:34,176
But even Jivanand
was after all human.

594
01:30:36,176 --> 01:30:40,182
He would not be able to stay away
from Shanti. He was drawn to her.

595
01:30:42,182 --> 01:30:48,189
But Shanti was not Shanti,
she was Nayanand.

596
01:30:49,189 --> 01:30:52,199
The union he wanted was not
possible in this friendship.

597
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:02,270
Bhavanand didn't
have even a minute's time.

598
01:31:02,270 --> 01:31:04,207
The workload was
increasing every day.

599
01:31:06,207 --> 01:31:09,310
But since Bhavanand had
seen Queen Kalyani. . .

600
01:31:09,310 --> 01:31:12,148
the ground has slipped
from under his feet.

601
01:31:14,148 --> 01:31:16,150
He would think,
he has to atone.

602
01:31:17,150 --> 01:31:19,157
But if Kalyani. . .

603
01:31:23,157 --> 01:31:29,167
He once extended his hand and
lost the hope of seeing her again.

604
01:31:33,167 --> 01:31:35,235
The Santan army rose in number.

605
01:31:35,235 --> 01:31:38,173
The British began to be attacked
more often and more openly.

606
01:31:40,173 --> 01:31:41,188
They were perturbed.

607
01:31:54,188 --> 01:31:55,139
Atrocities increased.

608
01:32:11,139 --> 01:32:13,141
The English would loot people.

609
01:32:14,141 --> 01:32:17,171
And Santan would kill
entire battalions of the English.

610
01:32:43,171 --> 01:32:47,675
Santan worked hard day and
night and made their first cannon.

611
01:32:47,675 --> 01:32:49,179
Their desire of years was fulfilled.

612
01:32:51,179 --> 01:32:54,182
The attacks by the Santan
scared the English.

613
01:32:55,182 --> 01:32:58,654
The news reached London.
Warren Hastings was sent immediately.

614
01:33:00,654 --> 01:33:02,197
As soon as he came,
he started investigations.

615
01:33:09,197 --> 01:33:10,731
Unaware of people's problems. . .

616
01:33:10,731 --> 01:33:12,134
lost in merriment and
debauchery in his royal palace. . .

617
01:33:13,134 --> 01:33:15,162
Nawab Mir Zafar was sent orders.

618
01:33:41,162 --> 01:33:43,171
Nawab was ousted.

619
01:33:51,171 --> 01:33:54,675
Plans were made.

620
01:33:54,675 --> 01:33:56,177
Conspiracies were hatched.

621
01:33:57,177 --> 01:33:59,180
And with their entire ground
force, the British. . .

622
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:05,182
moved forward to surround the army
of Santan and rule over India.

623
01:35:09,182 --> 01:35:13,123
Who are you?

624
01:35:17,123 --> 01:35:21,167
Speak out!
Are you a sage? I mean, Santan?

625
01:36:00,167 --> 01:36:04,117
Take your gun.
Look, I'm not like you.

626
01:36:16,117 --> 01:36:17,118
What?

627
01:36:18,118 --> 01:36:19,127
Who are you?

628
01:36:26,127 --> 01:36:34,135
Who are you?
- Me? The secretary of God of death.

629
01:36:34,135 --> 01:36:37,139
Are you the wife of some Santan?

630
01:36:38,139 --> 01:36:40,641
Yes.

631
01:36:41,641 --> 01:36:46,148
If it was someone else,
he would kill you.

632
01:36:47,148 --> 01:36:50,152
But I like you very much.

633
01:36:51,152 --> 01:36:56,162
Will you live in my house
as my mistress?

634
01:37:01,162 --> 01:37:03,229
What a monkey!

635
01:37:03,229 --> 01:37:08,170
Listen, we had a monkey at home.

636
01:37:09,170 --> 01:37:11,271
He looked just like you.

637
01:37:11,271 --> 01:37:15,676
But the poor animal died.

638
01:37:16,676 --> 01:37:20,185
His cage is vacant.
You come and live in his cage.

639
01:37:24,185 --> 01:37:26,188
I don't understand.

640
01:37:27,188 --> 01:37:29,197
How will you understand, you devil !

641
01:37:36,197 --> 01:37:41,268
Your husband will die in
the battle. He surely will.

642
01:37:41,268 --> 01:37:43,707
What will become of you then?

643
01:37:46,707 --> 01:37:48,211
Yes, what will happen?

644
01:37:50,211 --> 01:37:56,716
Let's decide. If you win the
battle, I will live in your home.

645
01:37:56,716 --> 01:37:59,220
If I survive. And if we win. . .

646
01:38:00,220 --> 01:38:04,291
then promise you will live in
place of the monkey in my home.

647
01:38:04,291 --> 01:38:06,694
And eat lots of bananas.

648
01:38:06,694 --> 01:38:10,164
Bananas? It's a good fruit.
Have it now?

649
01:38:11,164 --> 01:38:12,167
Shut-up! Uncouth man !

650
01:38:13,167 --> 01:38:18,173
I'll ask you something. Answer me.

651
01:38:20,173 --> 01:38:22,176
Why have you people
come to our country?

652
01:38:23,176 --> 01:38:26,680
To rescue you people.

653
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:31,185
You people are not happy
under the Nawab's rule.

654
01:38:31,185 --> 01:38:33,787
You have many fights.

655
01:38:33,787 --> 01:38:38,658
Okay, so we fight, and it
is a fight among ourselves.

656
01:38:38,658 --> 01:38:41,662
Whether we fight, kill,
it is our business.

657
01:38:41,662 --> 01:38:43,198
Why do you outsiders interfere?

658
01:38:44,198 --> 01:38:47,202
Don't you have your own country,
your own families?

659
01:38:48,202 --> 01:38:49,161
Why don't you go away?

660
01:39:14,161 --> 01:39:23,185
''How will you stop the storm?''

661
01:39:38,185 --> 01:39:41,154
''That has caught the young''

662
01:40:13,154 --> 01:40:19,168
''The stream has turned a river
in which flow our lives''

663
01:40:28,168 --> 01:40:31,676
''Many have drowned in it''

664
01:40:35,676 --> 01:40:38,184
''The heart looks for the shore''

665
01:40:43,184 --> 01:40:47,194
''The crazy flight of the
heart's bird''

666
01:40:53,194 --> 01:40:56,149
''How will you stop this storm?''

667
01:41:15,149 --> 01:41:18,153
''How will you convince the heart?''

668
01:41:19,153 --> 01:41:22,631
''How will you douse the fire?''

669
01:41:30,631 --> 01:41:34,171
''One that doesn't have a shore''

670
01:41:38,171 --> 01:41:42,180
''How will you cross that ocean?''

671
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:49,168
''How will you tie up the sky?''

672
01:42:42,168 --> 01:42:45,172
You? Over here?

673
01:42:46,172 --> 01:42:50,177
I could not stay away today,
that's why.

674
01:42:51,177 --> 01:42:55,189
But why? Why are you here?

675
01:43:03,189 --> 01:43:10,132
I'm asking you only.
Tell me, how do I stop this storm?

676
01:43:13,132 --> 01:43:17,237
Which shore are you looking for?

677
01:43:17,237 --> 01:43:23,645
The one I desire to touch,
my heart searches for that shore.

678
01:43:24,645 --> 01:43:29,248
How will you convince your heart?
- How will you douse the fire?

679
01:43:29,248 --> 01:43:30,152
No.

680
01:43:32,152 --> 01:43:34,154
Shanti, I've heard
Gurudev is returning.

681
01:43:35,154 --> 01:43:37,158
I will have to atone for my mistake.

682
01:43:38,158 --> 01:43:45,231
I have to die. Then before dying,
can't I once again get my Shanti?

683
01:43:45,231 --> 01:43:49,173
No! Leave me!
- What is wrong with you?

684
01:43:54,173 --> 01:43:57,145
Shanti, listen.

685
01:44:32,145 --> 01:44:33,162
Nayanand.

686
01:44:49,162 --> 01:44:51,167
Thank you very much, Shanti.

687
01:44:54,167 --> 01:44:56,171
Listen !

688
01:44:57,171 --> 01:45:01,274
I'm your wife.
It is such a shame for me.

689
01:45:01,274 --> 01:45:06,180
Despite knowing everything,
how can I cause your ruin?

690
01:45:07,180 --> 01:45:12,586
Why don't you understand and accept
that our love is not for this life. . .

691
01:45:12,586 --> 01:45:14,123
but for the next.

692
01:45:17,123 --> 01:45:19,193
And then, why do you
think of penance every time?

693
01:45:19,193 --> 01:45:24,131
You have promised never to share
the same chair with your wife.

694
01:45:25,131 --> 01:45:26,134
Have you ever?

695
01:45:27,134 --> 01:45:30,644
Hail the Lord !

696
01:45:37,644 --> 01:45:38,148
I'm leaving.

697
01:45:41,148 --> 01:45:45,618
You are right, our union
is not possible in this life.

698
01:45:45,618 --> 01:45:47,622
But we will surely meet
in our next life.

699
01:45:48,622 --> 01:45:58,231
Listen. You have promised that
you will meet your Shanti. . .

700
01:45:58,231 --> 01:46:03,171
one more time
before you offer penance.

701
01:46:04,171 --> 01:46:09,413
Will you keep your promise?
- Yes, Shanti.

702
01:50:29,413 --> 01:50:34,421
No dear, stop crying.
You must not cry like that.

703
01:50:37,421 --> 01:50:42,429
Get up, dear.
God will do good for you.

704
01:50:44,429 --> 01:50:51,372
Good? How will good be done
to me, Gurudev?

705
01:50:54,372 --> 01:50:56,849
You have ordered me to
become a widow.

706
01:51:04,849 --> 01:51:09,887
Jivanand will belong to you.
- There is no chance.

707
01:51:10,887 --> 01:51:15,394
You have returned. Now. . .
- No, dear.

708
01:51:16,394 --> 01:51:21,399
You can stop him.
I know, that if you wish. . .

709
01:51:22,399 --> 01:51:27,405
Me? Why will I wish that, Gurudev?

710
01:51:28,405 --> 01:51:32,412
Why should I be a hurdle in
someone's path and commit sin?

711
01:51:34,412 --> 01:51:40,418
If there is a heaven for him,
is there no heaven for me?

712
01:51:41,418 --> 01:51:44,422
It is not the question
of being a hurdle.

713
01:51:45,422 --> 01:51:49,429
I am thinking. . .

714
01:51:51,429 --> 01:51:56,368
that will Jivanand's
brave body be wasted?

715
01:51:57,368 --> 01:52:02,439
You only said, Gurudev,
that there is no solution.

716
01:52:02,439 --> 01:52:09,846
But you only requested me
to save his life.

717
01:52:09,846 --> 01:52:11,382
God didn't listen to me.

718
01:52:12,382 --> 01:52:14,387
War is not very far away now.

719
01:52:17,387 --> 01:52:20,992
Not far?
- Yes, dear.

720
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:23,395
The British army is moving forward.

721
01:52:25,395 --> 01:52:27,399
Even I met a Britisher.

722
01:52:29,399 --> 01:52:31,469
When?
- Today.

723
01:52:31,469 --> 01:52:35,408
Today? Where?
- In the jungle close by.

724
01:52:37,408 --> 01:52:40,412
Oh, so they have reached here too.

725
01:52:41,412 --> 01:52:43,416
They may attack any time.

726
01:52:45,416 --> 01:52:53,358
The problem is that because we
don't have any moles in their army. . .

727
01:52:54,358 --> 01:52:58,363
we don't have any information
about them.

728
01:52:59,363 --> 01:53:01,367
Shall I try?

729
01:53:03,367 --> 01:53:07,372
You?
- Just permit me. I. .I. . .

730
01:53:09,372 --> 01:53:13,378
Okay, try.

731
01:53:15,378 --> 01:53:16,438
May you be victorious.

732
01:54:14,438 --> 01:54:17,462
She's some nomad.
- Let us enjoy the song.

733
01:54:38,462 --> 01:54:40,466
''Come, O bee''

734
01:54:43,466 --> 01:54:48,538
''My heart is in full bloom,
sit on every flower''

735
01:54:48,538 --> 01:54:51,417
''Suck the nectar and fly away''

736
01:55:00,417 --> 01:55:05,435
''We are young, don't be
afraid, do as you please''

737
01:55:18,435 --> 01:55:21,439
''The affair begins today,
ends tomorrow''

738
01:55:21,439 --> 01:55:23,442
''Sing songs of love,
please your heart''

739
01:55:24,442 --> 01:55:26,444
''Who knows what will come tomorrow''

740
01:55:26,444 --> 01:55:27,954
''Come, O bee''

741
01:55:37,954 --> 01:55:42,465
''Tomorrow, you will not be there,
nor I, nor this garden''

742
01:55:47,465 --> 01:55:51,404
''Our love will blow up in the air''

743
01:55:54,404 --> 01:55:56,420
''Whose symbol is pain''

744
01:56:09,420 --> 01:56:11,435
''Such is a short life''

745
01:56:24,435 --> 01:56:26,503
''Neither will the king be,
nor the queen''

746
01:56:26,503 --> 01:56:28,439
''Only today is ours''

747
01:56:29,439 --> 01:56:32,913
Why don't you dance?

748
01:56:36,913 --> 01:56:41,952
No, I cannot dance today.
- Why?

749
01:56:41,952 --> 01:56:43,454
It is late and I
have to go very far.

750
01:56:44,454 --> 01:56:47,458
Where will you go?
What is the hurry? Sing !

751
01:56:48,458 --> 01:56:50,462
You have my promise.
- You have my promise!

752
01:56:51,462 --> 01:56:54,465
No, some other day.
I have to reach Padhchin.

753
01:56:54,465 --> 01:56:57,467
Padhchin? You live in Padhchin.

754
01:56:57,467 --> 01:57:01,404
Just sing one song.
- Some other time.

755
01:57:01,404 --> 01:57:02,408
When?
- Whenever you say.

756
01:57:05,408 --> 01:57:08,479
How many days will you be here?
- 4-5 days.

757
01:57:08,479 --> 01:57:12,515
4-5 days?
But how will you stay here?

758
01:57:12,515 --> 01:57:14,421
The moment the sages see
you, they will. . .

759
01:57:17,421 --> 01:57:19,423
You won't see any of them here.

760
01:57:20,423 --> 01:57:24,029
As if you are very brave.
Do you know, they are 10000 of them.

761
01:57:25,029 --> 01:57:26,898
We are 50000 of us.

762
01:57:27,898 --> 01:57:30,435
50000?
- What's going on?

763
01:57:31,435 --> 01:57:33,503
She doesn't believe we
are 50000 of us.

764
01:57:33,503 --> 01:57:38,443
Everyone is not here. 30000 of
them are coming with the Colonel.

765
01:57:39,443 --> 01:57:42,447
Oh God ! 30000 more? !

766
01:57:43,447 --> 01:57:46,951
The Santan army will be wiped out.

767
01:57:46,951 --> 01:57:48,551
Come with me.
- Where?

768
01:57:48,551 --> 01:57:50,554
Come with me.
- No, I'm getting late.

769
01:57:50,554 --> 01:57:53,416
Come. Sing a small song
and take a big reward.

770
01:58:18,416 --> 01:58:20,423
Come here. . .come here!

771
01:58:26,423 --> 01:58:30,431
Stop that!
. . . .Where have you come from?

772
01:58:34,431 --> 01:58:36,902
Are any kila ( fort ) there?

773
01:58:37,902 --> 01:58:41,439
Kela (banana ) Lots of them.
- Not kela, kila.

774
01:58:42,439 --> 01:58:46,845
Oh, you mean, fort. There is.
- How many men are there?

775
01:58:47,845 --> 01:58:53,387
How many?. . 1. . 2. .

776
01:58:57,387 --> 01:59:00,391
Maybe 12.
- Nonsense! How many hundred?

777
01:59:01,391 --> 01:59:02,395
Maybe 12 hundred.

778
01:59:04,395 --> 01:59:07,399
I mean, how many thousand.
- I said, 12 thousand.

779
01:59:09,399 --> 01:59:12,403
How much is this?
- Five.

780
01:59:12,403 --> 01:59:14,408
This?
- Nine.

781
01:59:17,408 --> 01:59:19,412
How many men in the fort?

782
01:59:21,412 --> 01:59:22,421
I said ten.

783
01:59:30,421 --> 01:59:32,426
When did you come from Padchin?

784
01:59:35,426 --> 01:59:43,434
Oh ! So why are you banging
your feet? Say Padh-chin.

785
01:59:43,434 --> 01:59:47,505
Okay, Padh-chin. Are they
still there, or have they left?

786
01:59:47,505 --> 01:59:48,439
Where can they go?

787
01:59:49,439 --> 01:59:55,381
We heard their leader is back,
and Magi festival. . .

788
01:59:57,381 --> 02:59:58,768
Yes, fair, he's called
everyone to the fair.

789
02:00:04,387 --> 02:00:09,394
Sir, I don't understand English.
Now will you give me some money?

790
02:00:10,394 --> 02:00:12,997
No? I'm leaving.

791
02:00:12,997 --> 02:00:17,402
They heard my song for free.
- Hey, listen !

792
02:00:18,402 --> 02:00:20,407
I'll give you lots of money.

793
02:00:23,407 --> 02:00:24,412
Come here.

794
02:00:28,412 --> 02:00:30,414
Give.
- I'll give you lots.

795
02:00:31,414 --> 02:00:34,420
Give me news on Padhchin.
- News?

796
02:00:36,420 --> 02:00:40,524
Okay, next time.
- How many are they?

797
02:00:40,524 --> 02:00:42,525
When will they leave the fort?

798
02:00:42,525 --> 02:00:47,431
That's all? I'll inform
you day after tomorrow.

799
02:00:48,431 --> 02:00:52,069
No, we want the news tonight.
- I said day after.

800
02:00:53,069 --> 02:00:57,377
Let me speak to her.
We want to attack tomorrow.

801
02:01:00,377 --> 02:01:02,380
Can't you come tonight?

802
02:01:03,380 --> 02:01:08,886
Keep your gun besides your pillow,
drink, and sleep!

803
02:01:08,886 --> 02:01:11,488
I'll go and come in one night.

804
02:01:11,488 --> 02:01:14,393
The bloody chuchundar ( mole ) !

805
02:01:16,393 --> 02:01:19,398
What is chuchundar?

806
02:01:21,398 --> 02:01:22,867
Don't you know?

807
02:01:23,867 --> 02:01:28,408
Chuchundar means brave
and courageous.

808
02:01:31,408 --> 02:01:36,479
Brave! Like I can be one.

809
02:01:36,479 --> 02:01:39,417
If you bring me the news tonight,
even I can be brave.

810
02:01:40,417 --> 02:01:42,920
I'll give you a reward of Rs. 100.

811
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:48,426
Whether you pay 100 or 1000,
I cannot walk 20 miles.

812
02:01:49,426 --> 02:01:50,427
Go on horseback.

813
02:01:51,427 --> 02:01:55,365
I'll have to,
or how will my job get done?

814
02:01:55,365 --> 02:01:56,368
What did you say?

815
02:01:58,368 --> 02:02:07,444
I cannot ride a horse.
- A man will take you.

816
02:02:07,444 --> 02:02:12,384
What rubbish ! How will I
mount the same horse as a man?

817
02:02:13,384 --> 02:02:19,489
I'll pay you Rs. 300.
- Sir, you don't understand.

818
02:02:19,489 --> 02:02:24,396
What will people say?
- All right! I'll pay you Rs. 500.

819
02:02:26,396 --> 02:02:31,403
Rs. 500 ! Will you really?
- Yes! I surely will.

820
02:02:32,403 --> 02:02:35,409
Okay. Are you coming with me?
- No, not me.

821
02:02:39,409 --> 02:02:40,882
Come.

822
02:02:45,882 --> 02:02:46,367
Rs. 500, okay?

823
02:03:03,367 --> 02:03:05,373
Come soon !
- Coming.

824
02:03:10,373 --> 02:03:11,377
Kalyani, are you all right?

825
02:03:13,377 --> 02:03:14,378
Are you okay?

826
02:03:15,378 --> 02:03:18,384
Whether I'm okay or not,
it's not your concern.

827
02:03:20,384 --> 02:03:23,387
Can't I care even that much
for you? Open the door, Kalyani.

828
02:03:24,387 --> 02:03:29,394
Decent men don't knock on unknown
women's doors at such a late hour.

829
02:03:30,394 --> 02:03:34,465
I know. But I. . .I don't
treat you as unknown. . .

830
02:03:34,465 --> 02:03:37,001
For me, you are. . .
Open the door, Kalyani.

831
02:03:38,001 --> 02:03:40,104
I have something important
to talk to you.

832
02:03:41,104 --> 02:03:43,408
Come some other time
during the day.

833
02:03:44,408 --> 02:03:47,478
Gurudev has returned, Kalyani.
And the war will begin in 1-2 days.

834
02:03:47,478 --> 02:03:52,416
So I want to tell you all that
I could not in the last four years.

835
02:03:52,416 --> 02:03:54,422
Open the door, Kalyani.

836
02:03:59,422 --> 02:04:03,426
Who gave you the
right to call me Kalyani?

837
02:04:03,426 --> 02:04:04,831
Right?

838
02:04:07,831 --> 02:04:09,435
You are asking me the right?

839
02:04:11,435 --> 02:04:15,440
Why? Don't I have any right?

840
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:23,448
I do! Since the day I gave you new
life, I can call you by any name.

841
02:04:24,448 --> 02:04:27,850
Kalyani, you belong to me,
and nobody else.

842
02:04:27,850 --> 02:04:30,458
Kalyani, I have given you new life.

843
02:04:35,458 --> 02:04:39,466
Who told you to give me new life?

844
02:04:42,466 --> 02:04:49,474
Now I realise.
So you saved me for this day?

845
02:04:50,474 --> 02:04:52,877
That is why you could not bring
my daughter to me until this day.

846
02:04:53,877 --> 02:04:56,881
That is why my husband
doesn't even know I'm alive.

847
02:04:57,881 --> 02:04:58,421
New life!

848
02:05:04,421 --> 02:05:09,427
I will bring your baby,
but your husband. . .

849
02:05:11,427 --> 02:05:14,431
He thinks you're dead.
- What are you trying to say?

850
02:05:15,431 --> 02:05:21,439
That you can marry again.
- What!

851
02:05:22,439 --> 02:05:25,911
Kalyani, if you wish,
you can marry again.

852
02:05:27,911 --> 02:05:32,451
With whom? You?
- What is I say yes?

853
02:05:34,451 --> 02:05:37,454
What about your oath?
- I don't know.

854
02:05:38,454 --> 02:05:41,458
Your deed?
- I don't care.

855
02:05:42,458 --> 02:05:44,560
Your name, Bhavanand?

856
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:47,463
I know nothing
except that I love you.

857
02:05:47,463 --> 02:05:51,601
The oath is my life, but you
are more dear to me than life.

858
02:05:51,601 --> 02:05:54,404
I cannot take
this any more, Kalyani.

859
02:05:55,404 --> 02:06:01,412
Say it once. Only once, Kalyani !

860
02:06:02,412 --> 02:06:03,414
Say you will belong to me.

861
02:06:05,414 --> 02:06:09,420
I think I'd heard it
from you only. . .

862
02:06:10,420 --> 02:06:13,925
that a fallen Santan has to
offer penance.

863
02:06:14,925 --> 02:06:17,949
And that penance is death.

864
02:06:39,949 --> 02:06:43,453
Yes. . .yes.
- Then your penance?

865
02:06:44,453 --> 02:06:49,460
Is death.
- What if Kalyani belongs to you?

866
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:52,396
I won't be ale to do penance.

867
02:06:53,396 --> 02:06:56,403
And if she does not?
- Not even then.

868
02:06:59,403 --> 02:07:03,908
Kalyani can never belong to you.

869
02:07:37,908 --> 02:07:43,448
I think I'd heard from you only that
a fallen Santan has to offer penance.

870
02:07:44,448 --> 02:07:47,452
And that penance is death.

871
02:07:48,452 --> 02:07:52,421
Yes. . .yes.

872
02:08:25,421 --> 02:08:28,926
Gurudev, give me your blessings.

873
02:08:30,926 --> 02:08:36,404
Gurudev, give me your blessings.

874
02:09:14,404 --> 02:09:20,411
The enemy is approaching.

875
02:09:21,411 --> 02:09:28,921
We had the power to
rip the enemy apart.

876
02:09:30,921 --> 02:09:31,423
We did.

877
02:09:34,423 --> 02:09:35,430
But. . .

878
02:09:41,430 --> 02:09:46,439
it is our misfortune.

879
02:09:49,439 --> 02:09:55,378
However much we try, we cannot
get the cannons before evening.

880
02:09:56,378 --> 02:09:57,886
Not under any circumstances.

881
02:10:02,886 --> 02:10:04,393
We'll have to think of something.

882
02:10:10,393 --> 02:10:18,404
Rather than be arrested by the
enemy, let us not waste our lives.

883
02:10:22,404 --> 02:10:26,409
Putting our country's
honor to dust. . .

884
02:10:27,409 --> 02:10:31,416
getting the Santan army
labeled as bandits and looters. . .

885
02:10:33,416 --> 02:10:38,422
and accepting defeat before destiny.
Will we allow that to happen?

886
02:10:40,422 --> 02:10:49,434
These foreigners will come from
outside and enslave our India. . .

887
02:10:51,434 --> 02:10:53,375
will we be able to tolerate that?
- No!

888
02:10:58,375 --> 02:10:59,845
Enough.

889
02:11:02,845 --> 02:11:11,390
I knew that you, chosen
soldiers of the Santan army. . .

890
02:11:13,390 --> 02:11:15,394
will never let that happen.

891
02:11:17,394 --> 02:11:19,863
With courage in your heart. . .

892
02:11:20,863 --> 02:11:23,400
and your life in your hands. . .

893
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:29,408
you will stand before the
English as a mountain.

894
02:11:31,408 --> 02:11:37,414
You will snatch their cannons
from them and turn it on them.

895
02:11:38,414 --> 02:11:39,819
We will !

896
02:11:42,819 --> 02:11:47,426
Then go, O sons of Mother India !

897
02:11:49,426 --> 02:11:54,363
Write the first chapter of the
history of India's freedom struggle. . .

898
02:11:54,363 --> 02:11:55,367
with your blood.

899
02:11:57,367 --> 02:12:01,971
Instead of stone and brick,
lay the foundation of freedom. . .

900
02:12:01,971 --> 02:12:03,375
with your body.

901
02:12:05,375 --> 02:12:12,481
One day, when the grand and shining
monument of freedom. . .

902
02:12:12,481 --> 02:12:15,386
will stand on that foundation. . .

903
02:12:16,386 --> 02:12:19,390
every Indian will remember. . .

904
02:12:20,390 --> 02:12:25,395
that the foundation of this
freedom was laid by Anand Math !

905
02:12:26,395 --> 02:12:28,412
Mother, I bow to thee!

906
02:12:42,412 --> 02:12:47,420
You are the army chief
of today's battle.

907
02:12:50,420 --> 02:12:54,860
Victory will be yours!

908
02:12:57,860 --> 02:13:06,394
May you succeed !

909
02:13:31,394 --> 02:13:33,412
Go. . .go.

910
02:13:49,412 --> 02:13:56,420
I had given you a promise.
I may not get another chance.

911
02:13:57,420 --> 02:14:02,434
Consider this our last meeting.

912
02:14:11,434 --> 02:14:15,439
Shanti, say yes.

913
02:14:17,439 --> 02:14:18,913
Yes.

914
02:14:24,913 --> 02:14:29,953
Santan ! We have got the opportunity
to attack the British today.

915
02:14:29,953 --> 02:14:31,954
Are you ready?
- Ready!

916
02:14:31,954 --> 02:14:37,461
We have to attack their cannons.

917
02:14:38,461 --> 02:14:39,894
Move forward !

918
02:19:04,894 --> 02:19:07,462
Jivanand, I have come now,
you return.

919
02:19:07,462 --> 02:19:10,000
No Bhavanand, no point in both
of us losing our lives. You return.

920
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:14,872
I want to die today.
- No, I will die today.

921
02:19:16,872 --> 02:19:21,412
Go back, Jivanand.
- No, I have to offer penance.

922
02:19:22,412 --> 02:19:25,480
I cannot let go this opportunity.
- Whose penance?

923
02:19:25,480 --> 02:19:27,516
Mine.
- Then why sacrifice so many men?

924
02:19:27,516 --> 02:19:29,418
There is no other solution.
- Why not?

925
02:19:29,418 --> 02:19:31,521
I'll take some men
and attack the cannons.

926
02:19:31,521 --> 02:19:33,923
You take the others and
cross the river.

927
02:19:33,923 --> 02:19:34,899
All right.

928
02:19:43,899 --> 02:19:47,380
We have to cross that bridge.

929
02:21:05,380 --> 02:21:08,884
Santan ! all the British
soldiers will die today!

930
02:22:14,884 --> 02:22:18,888
Men, move forward !
- Bhavanand, don't go ahead.

931
02:22:18,888 --> 02:22:21,862
We have to move forward. Attack!

932
02:22:26,862 --> 02:22:29,398
Santan, look! The cannons
have stopped firing bombs. .

933
02:22:30,398 --> 02:22:32,402
Bhavanand must have captured them.

934
02:22:33,402 --> 02:22:36,407
Move forward now, Santan !

935
02:22:39,407 --> 02:22:44,415
We have captured the cannons!
Mother, I bow to thee!

936
02:22:46,415 --> 02:22:49,418
But the enemy is
still flying its flag.

937
02:22:50,418 --> 02:22:53,456
The frauds are doing that
to save their lives.

938
02:22:53,456 --> 02:22:56,859
But they have been defeated. Your
condition is very bad, Bhavanand.

939
02:22:56,859 --> 02:23:00,362
Turn back now, Bhavanand.

940
02:23:00,362 --> 02:23:05,368
No, until even one soldier of the
enemy is alive, I cannot turn back.

941
02:23:05,368 --> 02:23:07,406
Mother, I bow to thee!

942
02:23:44,406 --> 02:23:47,412
The enemy killed himself.

943
02:23:49,412 --> 02:23:55,518
Remember Santan ! If the
enemy captures the cannons again. . .

944
02:23:55,518 --> 02:23:59,522
you will be answerable
for Bhavanand's sacrifice.

945
02:23:59,522 --> 02:24:03,897
You will be responsible for the
sacrifice of thousands of Santan.

946
02:24:08,897 --> 02:24:10,435
Tell Gurudev. . .

947
02:24:13,435 --> 02:24:16,504
I could kill the enemy.
- He is aware.

948
02:24:16,504 --> 02:24:17,949
He had blessed you.

949
02:24:26,949 --> 02:24:31,457
We could not do anything.

950
02:24:34,457 --> 02:24:37,460
Wish Jivanand came here.

951
02:24:38,460 --> 02:24:43,941
Cowards! Traitors!
come with me. Or I am leaving.

952
02:24:51,941 --> 02:24:57,479
If you meet Nayanand, tell him
we'll surely meet in our next lives.

953
02:24:57,479 --> 02:24:59,156
Mother, I bow to thee!

954
02:25:07,156 --> 02:25:12,442
Santan ! March forward !
Mother, I bow to thee!

955
02:25:27,442 --> 02:25:31,952
Look! Jivanand is coming.

956
02:25:37,952 --> 02:25:42,463
Our army will win !

957
02:25:48,463 --> 02:25:54,957
Mother, I bow to thee!
- Mother, I bow to thee!

958
02:26:47,957 --> 02:26:52,395
Get the cannons ready.

959
02:26:53,395 --> 02:26:56,921
Santan army, attacks!

960
02:27:18,921 --> 02:27:22,897
How long will it take?
- It's not catching fire.

961
02:27:28,897 --> 02:27:29,436
Fire!

962
02:27:35,436 --> 02:27:36,444
Hiranand, what happened?

963
02:27:43,444 --> 02:27:45,450
Santan ! get ready!

964
02:27:48,450 --> 02:27:50,052
We have to attack them.
- No.

965
02:27:51,052 --> 02:27:56,492
We have to stop them anyhow!

966
02:27:56,492 --> 02:27:58,423
Come, let us strike them
like lightening !

967
02:28:27,423 --> 02:28:31,434
Fight till your last breath !
Don't let the enemy win.

968
02:28:39,434 --> 02:28:41,925
Fight till your last breath !

969
02:31:50,925 --> 02:31:58,369
Child Shanti, the one who is
the joy of man, why cry over him?

970
02:32:00,369 --> 02:32:03,373
Jivanand can never die.

971
02:32:05,373 --> 02:32:07,377
He has not died?

972
02:32:08,377 --> 02:32:14,385
You are a sage,
you are speaking the truth.

973
02:32:16,385 --> 02:32:18,388
Jivanand is not dead.

974
02:32:19,388 --> 02:32:20,390
He has offered penance.

975
02:32:22,390 --> 02:32:27,397
He has offered penance.
- Yes dear, he has.

976
02:32:28,397 --> 02:32:31,400
But do you know
the penance for which crime?

977
02:32:32,400 --> 02:32:40,409
Her own sons committed the grave
sin of enslaving their Motherland.

978
02:32:41,409 --> 02:32:44,414
They have offered penance
for that sin.

979
02:32:45,414 --> 02:32:48,417
Many such penance
have to be offered yet.

980
02:32:49,417 --> 02:32:51,844
Only then will
Mother become free.

981
02:33:16,844 --> 02:33:20,396
Take this water
and wash Jivanand's face.

982
02:33:34,396 --> 02:33:36,413
Take some more.

983
02:33:51,413 --> 02:33:57,420
Look, there is no sign
of death on his face.

984
02:33:58,420 --> 02:34:02,424
Don't you see a million
Jivanand's shining on his face?

985
02:34:03,424 --> 02:34:06,429
Can Jivanand ever die?

986
02:34:07,429 --> 02:34:12,433
Look at the whole of India once.

987
02:34:12,433 --> 02:34:19,441
See how it is glowing
with the sacrifice of Jivanand.

988
02:34:20,441 --> 02:34:27,450
Hear the glory of
the mute children of India

989
02:34:28,450 --> 02:34:31,953
The victory of her brave sons.

990
02:34:31,953 --> 02:34:36,459
The glory of immortal martyr,
Jivanand.

991
02:34:37,459 --> 02:34:40,463
Hear it, dear.

992
02:34:42,463 --> 02:34:47,407
Glory to the brave Jivanand !

993
02:34:53,407 --> 02:34:55,415
Glory to martyr Jivanand !

994
02:35:00,415 --> 02:35:03,422
Glory to the brave Bhavanand !

995
02:35:07,422 --> 02:35:10,425
Glory to King Mahendra Singh !

996
02:35:11,425 --> 02:35:15,898
Glory to Queen Kalyani !

997
02:35:17,898 --> 02:35:24,440
No Mother! This is not victory!

998
02:35:25,440 --> 02:35:31,448
In the first battle for freedom,
I lost both my arms?

999
02:35:33,448 --> 02:35:34,451
Mother. . .

1000
02:35:37,451 --> 02:35:41,458
are you listening?

1001
02:35:43,458 --> 02:35:47,463
They are coming to
take my permission.

1002
02:35:49,463 --> 02:35:51,402
They are coming to seek permission
to attack the capital.

1003
02:35:53,402 --> 02:35:59,408
Mother, I know I must
give them permission right away.

1004
02:36:00,408 --> 02:36:02,878
The enemy will be defeated.

1005
02:36:02,878 --> 02:36:07,417
They can uproot the enemy now.

1006
02:36:09,417 --> 02:36:11,422
But how do I give
them this permission?

1007
02:36:13,422 --> 02:36:18,429
How can I? You snatched
Bhavanand and Jivanand from me.

1008
02:36:20,429 --> 02:36:23,433
You chopped both my hands.

1009
02:36:24,433 --> 02:36:29,905
Pardon me, Mother.

1010
02:36:29,905 --> 02:36:34,912
Tell me, how do I lift my sword?

1011
02:36:36,912 --> 02:36:44,454
I had lifted the sword
to break your shackles.

1012
02:36:46,454 --> 02:36:56,864
To break the chains of your death,
of your slavery, of atrocity!

1013
02:36:56,864 --> 02:36:59,872
Tell me, Mother!

1014
02:37:04,872 --> 02:37:10,414
No. . . no!
This is not victory.

1015
02:37:12,414 --> 02:37:14,416
No. . . no!
This is not victory.

1016
02:37:15,416 --> 02:37:19,422
I don't accept this as victory.
This glory is fake!

1017
02:37:20,422 --> 02:37:23,434
This glory is fake!

1018
02:37:33,434 --> 02:37:34,443
This is your victory,
Satyanand.

1019
02:37:42,443 --> 02:37:43,949
You have come!

1020
02:37:47,949 --> 02:37:54,389
Satyanand, I have come to
thank you. You are great.

1021
02:37:55,389 --> 02:37:57,395
You have fulfilled
Mother's desire of years.

1022
02:38:00,395 --> 02:38:02,398
You have started the
struggle for freedom.

1023
02:38:04,398 --> 02:38:06,869
This will not stop now.
It will continue.

1024
02:38:07,869 --> 02:38:13,408
The shining lamps of devotion
that you have lit. . .

1025
02:38:14,408 --> 02:38:22,417
Bhavanand, Jivanand, Mahendra,
Kalyani, Shanti, and many more. . .

1026
02:38:23,417 --> 02:38:27,423
will guide million of people
to the path of freedom.

1027
02:38:28,423 --> 02:38:34,429
Sons of India ! Celebrate
this great victory of yours.

1028
02:38:34,429 --> 02:38:38,433
Sing the glory of Mother!

1029
02:38:39,433 --> 02:38:40,381
Sing !

1030
02:38:54,381 --> 02:39:01,389
And thus began India's
first struggle for freedom. . .

1031
02:39:02,389 --> 02:39:04,395
which martyrs
wrote with their blood.

1032
02:39:07,395 --> 02:39:12,402
The lamp of the divine mantra of
Vande Mataram was lit.

1033
02:39:14,402 --> 02:39:18,407
The call of a handful of Santan
became the voice of millions.

1034
02:39:20,407 --> 02:39:24,413
Hundreds, thousands, millions,
knowingly, unknowingly. . .

1035
02:39:25,413 --> 02:39:28,417
became the target of swords,
cannons, guns.

1036
02:39:30,417 --> 02:39:32,421
Many went smiling to the gallows. . .

1037
02:39:33,421 --> 02:39:36,426
chanting this divine mantra !

1038
02:39:39,426 --> 02:39:47,000
The country became free.
But today. . .where is Vande Mataram?
