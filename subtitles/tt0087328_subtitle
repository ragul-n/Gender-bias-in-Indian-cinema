1
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:38,409
I am the person who, came
through the fire.

2
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,997
What ever has to be
burnt, was burnt.

3
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:47,710
What ever left, has nothing
to burn in it.

4
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:53,507
This is me, who has offered
every thing to him.

5
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,678
Who has accepted all my sins
lnto..

6
00:02:57,762 --> 00:02:59,597
..his deepest feelings of agony.

7
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:04,435
I know he is the rarest
of all mankind.

8
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:11,609
I saw this man, ten years
back for the first time.

9
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:15,446
He used to belong
to a Royal family.

10
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:18,616
And I made my entry to this
family as a housewife.

11
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,914
Prior to my marriage only, l
came to know that the person..

12
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:27,958
..who is going to be my
husband, is a man of control.

13
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:31,921
After knowing it, I used to
consider myself as a lucky woman.

14
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:33,798
Since my entry to this family..

15
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:35,299
..I saw the wife of
my brother in law..

16
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:36,634
..in the dress code of a widow.

17
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:40,596
Though it was never reflected,
but I could understand..

18
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,640
..that she hasn't got
any of the pleasures..

19
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:44,475
..of a happy marital life.

20
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:03,452
Both of our place was in the
interior of the royal palace.

21
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:05,287
There was a corridor made
of colored glasses...

22
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:07,289
....which was situated
in between the external..

23
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:08,499
..and internal part
of this house.

24
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:12,003
The door at this corridor
was restricted to us.

25
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,006
I never had any
grievance for it.

26
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:17,341
Because, my mind was tuned..

27
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:19,343
..to the contemporary
orthodox pattern.

28
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,680
But my husband was a
man of modern age.

29
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:25,683
And he was the first member of..

30
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:28,019
..the family, who did ìMaster'sî..

31
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:31,313
To fulfill his desires Mrs.
Gilbey made her entry as..

32
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:33,816
.. my teacher so that, I could
become an English woman.

33
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:56,584
What made you come here?

34
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,604
Foreign costume, foreign
tunes, do you think..

35
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,856
..you will be able to even
recognize us, after few days?

36
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:22,276
How am I looking? - Very nice.

37
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:25,279
Just like a portrait.

38
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,450
Chhutu, you are lucky enough.

39
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,619
Try to fulfill all your desires.

40
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:38,626
None of the wives of this
family has ever seen happiness.

41
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,881
Marital happiness was fantasy.

42
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:47,885
There were wives of this
house, to whom even..

43
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,638
..a glance of her husband was
the rarest of the rare occasions.

44
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:54,809
Nights together, they
used to dress up..

45
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:58,020
..and wait for their
husband's call.

46
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:03,859
It was just two days before
he passed away,

47
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:06,570
I was siting beside him,

48
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:11,242
He was almost unconscious
as was running high fever.

49
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:14,412
High temperature.

50
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,543
Suddenly, he opened his eyes
and asked me that, who am l?

51
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:22,586
Even he could not been able
to recognize his own wife.

52
00:08:26,382 --> 00:08:28,342
How will you be able
to understand that..

53
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:29,927
..how lucky you are, Chhutu.

54
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:32,430
Why do you think that
I will not feel that?

55
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:36,267
Where can you find a person
as good as my husband?

56
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,561
Just see, you will live long.

57
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,896
We were just discussing about
you only. - Is it so?

58
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,023
Yes.

59
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:46,277
I knew that, they are the
girls who play with doll.

60
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:49,780
Now I can see that, the males
too take part of it. - How?

61
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:53,617
Your imported doll, your
wife. Can't you see?

62
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:54,910
Oh! I see.

63
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:56,954
It's your dreams only, which
are going to be fulfilled.

64
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:00,583
A man having no desires..

65
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:04,253
..how can you think of it,
my sister in law.

66
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:06,964
Ok, it's your choice.

67
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:13,637
Let me observe it from distance.

68
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,931
Why from a distance?

69
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:18,434
What's harm in coming closer?

70
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:19,769
It's better to keep distance.

71
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:24,273
In our days, we were familiar
with ìlttarsî..

72
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,611
Can't stand these
foreign perfumes.

73
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:30,613
Let me push off.

74
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:51,967
Are these the new ones?

75
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:53,803
The tailor just delivered
It today.

76
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:55,638
All designed by me only.

77
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:58,683
That I can understand.

78
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,978
But, you dress up so
nicely, to show me,

79
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:06,482
And no other male can see it,
except me, does it make sense?

80
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:09,652
Do you think I dress up to
show it to all the males?

81
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,279
Why all males?

82
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:15,324
Only to those, whom I always
feel proud talking about you.

83
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:18,703
Hope they are not
going to marry me.

84
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:22,498
Do you know one thing?

85
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:23,833
What's that?

86
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,502
We the Hindus never had such
customs earlier to confine..

87
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:29,505
..women in the interior
of their house.

88
00:10:29,714 --> 00:10:32,675
Take instance of Sita,
Sabitri, Draupadi..

89
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:35,761
..none of them were confined.

90
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:38,723
What so ever, but your Bimala
Is comfortable here.

91
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:45,938
In the historic age, the ladies
used to choose their husband.

92
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:48,399
Hope you know about ìSayambharî?

93
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,528
Why are you laughing?

94
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,530
If I would have called
ìSayambharî..

95
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,949
..I might have not
garlanded you.

96
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,576
That I can understand.

97
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:00,619
There you would have
your own choice.

98
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:02,705
Here you didn't have that.

99
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:04,707
How sad it is!

100
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,543
I feel jealous about Draupadi.

101
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:09,754
Having five numbers of husbands.

102
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:15,968
You haven't seen any other male
than yours, in your whole life.

103
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,303
How will you know, that
the person whom..

104
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,972
..you got married
is good or bad?

105
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:22,725
Unless you could compare your
husband with other men.

106
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,644
Are you trying to bring back..

107
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,855
..those ancient times? - Why so?

108
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:30,608
There is no justification
In admission..

109
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,318
..of these curtains
in one's life.

110
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,987
I believe this has come from
the Muslim tradition.

111
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,866
These were never with Hindus.

112
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:42,870
I am not thinking about
all the people.

113
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:45,998
There is no justification in
thinking, that people will stop..

114
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:47,333
..maintaining these customs.

115
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:51,420
Don't you know that, I am
not like all other people?

116
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,632
As it is a custom, l
have to follow it..

117
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,634
..I don't accept such concepts.

118
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:13,025
I will really feel proud..

119
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,028
..if I could take you out
to my friends.

120
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:20,574
Do you mean this friend?

121
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:21,784
Yes.

122
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:27,373
Sandip is really genius.

123
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:32,920
I have no interest to meet that
friend, who always tries..

124
00:12:33,004 --> 00:12:35,715
..to pull money from you,
giving several reasons.

125
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:39,385
Sandip works for the nation.

126
00:12:39,844 --> 00:12:42,304
He has got quality,
but has no money.

127
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,599
It will be of my benefit,
if I could be a part of..

128
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:47,309
..his qualities by giving money.

129
00:12:47,435 --> 00:12:48,477
What do you mean by the
ìworks for the nationî?

130
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:51,397
What is the job?
- Swadeshi.

131
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:53,315
Do you know about Swadeshi?

132
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:54,608
Do you think I do not know?

133
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:57,695
This is uttered several
times nowadays.

134
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,740
Boycott foreign articles.

135
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:02,950
Only wear lndia made dresses.

136
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:06,662
Don't use foreign salt and
sugar, than made of the nation.

137
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:09,373
How do you know so many things?

138
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,877
Don't I read newspaper?

139
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:15,379
But, do you know, why
they are saying so?

140
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:18,049
Even I know that.
- Tell me.

141
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:20,634
Come, sit here, right
in front of me.

142
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,686
Yes sir, ask me.

143
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,481
Can you tell me, why
it is Swadeshi?

144
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,650
The Governor has divided
the Bengal.

145
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:38,986
Hindus and Muslims used
to stay together..

146
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,321
..but a partition
has been built..

147
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,490
..between them and that is the
reason for this agitation.

148
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:50,498
Hope, some time you forget, that
your wife is a literate lady.

149
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:53,501
How can't I know this,
since I know English.

150
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:01,342
Sandip is one of the great
Workers..

151
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:03,344
..of this Swadeshi team.

152
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:10,851
Their anthem is ìVande
Mataramî isn't it?

153
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:15,690
ìVande Mataramî.

154
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,817
Yes it means Hail Motherland.

155
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,569
They have enchanted
the whole nation..

156
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:22,446
..only by the power
of this anthem.

157
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,782
Except one.

158
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:27,702
He is just like, he was.

159
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,752
Because, I can not get influenced
to some thing so easily.

160
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:44,051
Though, I do not support the
policy of Lord Curzon.

161
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:48,305
Building up a deference between
Hindu and Muslim..

162
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:51,058
..I consider it as
a great offence.

163
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:53,894
All their foreign articles
are set on fire, isn't it?

164
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:59,442
If they get this Sari of yours,
they will immediately burn it.

165
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:00,943
Really?
- Yes.

166
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:04,280
Do you know, from where the
thread of this Sari, has come?

167
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:06,449
Where from?
- Manchester.

168
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:08,617
Really?
- Yes.

169
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:10,745
Even, most of the articles
of your dressing..

170
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:11,871
..table are foreign made.

171
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:15,541
This brush is imported,
the mirror is imported..

172
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,960
..and the comb is imported.

173
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:22,465
On this side, this hairpin
is imported..

174
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:25,676
..these perfumes are all French.

175
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:30,014
Even this bottle is practically
an imported cutglass.

176
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:32,892
This table is imported.

177
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:39,648
All the furniture of this room,
Are made by Lagerus.

178
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:42,318
A foreign company.

179
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:49,492
Really, we didn't even
think it before.

180
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,495
What do you suggest,
we should do?

181
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:56,040
Better you ask Sandip
this question.

182
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,917
He is expected here.

183
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,252
Here?
- Yes.

184
00:16:00,378 --> 00:16:02,421
When?
- Soon.

185
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,465
He is going to be
our guest only.

186
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,592
He will conduct a lecture
at our temple.

187
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:15,017
I feel that you will be happy,
if you meet Sandip.

188
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:17,812
Why?

189
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:23,317
Sandip is having a quality,
which every woman likes most.

190
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:29,448
Many woman he met
through his life.

191
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:33,369
Amongst them, all
were not Swadeshi.

192
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:35,454
So only marriage was not done?

193
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:39,625
It can't take place because
of time scarcity.

194
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:43,838
Of course he is not a
common type family man.

195
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:46,882
He is very freckled.

196
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:49,468
Just opposite to me.

197
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,555
Who told you that, l
want to change you?

198
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:59,311
May be you don't want,
but it is required.

199
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:02,314
I am enough comfortable
here inside the house.

200
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,567
I don't have a desire to
be a Sita or Sabitri.

201
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,406
I was not at all prepared
for the following incident.

202
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:55,576
I was surprised to
hear Ms. Gilbey.

203
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,497
Today is Sunday, so she
went to the church.

204
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,833
While returning, one of the
schoolboys of this area..

205
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,795
..hit on her head with a stone.

206
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,339
As if this is the influence
of ìSwadesiî.

207
00:18:08,464 --> 00:18:10,508
The people are having so much of..

208
00:18:10,633 --> 00:18:12,510
..hatred against the Britishers.

209
00:18:12,635 --> 00:18:14,595
That life is become
unsecured for even..

210
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:17,598
..innocent persons
like Ms. Gilbey.

211
00:18:17,682 --> 00:18:21,686
I was assured that I can no
more become a foreigner.

212
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:28,943
Ms. Gilbey said that.

213
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:34,699
After some days, ìSwadeshiî
team came in our temple.

214
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:38,953
Hail motherland. Hail motherland.

215
00:18:40,663 --> 00:18:43,791
Can you see?
- Where?

216
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:45,960
There, there the one who is
carried on the shoulders.

217
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:49,797
Hail motherland. Hail motherland.

218
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:15,364
Brothers..

219
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:21,746
All of you know, why we
Assembled here today.

220
00:19:22,705 --> 00:19:29,420
Since few days, Bengal
is facing great crisis.

221
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:33,424
Our golden Bengal is divided
by the political weapon..

222
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:38,012
..used by the Governor
of lndia, Lord Karzon.

223
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:44,602
The friendship, the fraternity
which tied up the two religion..

224
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:51,359
..class of the east and
west of our country.

225
00:19:51,484 --> 00:19:54,904
There lies an internal
power which..

226
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:58,741
..frightened the
English rulers.

227
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:00,951
The division has brought
a great shock..

228
00:20:01,077 --> 00:20:03,037
..at the root of this power.

229
00:20:03,496 --> 00:20:06,499
Toady, all of us know that
ìDivide and Ruleî..

230
00:20:06,624 --> 00:20:09,794
..is the policy of
English emperor.

231
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:13,589
By creating difference between
the two classes..

232
00:20:13,673 --> 00:20:17,385
..they tried to strengthen
their ruling ground.

233
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:19,470
The English government has
Endless..

234
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:21,472
..courage and audacity as well.

235
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:25,559
The leaders of Bengal
united and protested..

236
00:20:25,643 --> 00:20:28,479
..against the division
of Bengal.

237
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,315
But government didn't pay
any attention to it.

238
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,527
We didn't had that power
to stop this division.

239
00:20:34,652 --> 00:20:36,320
But the government
didn't expect..

240
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:38,322
..that in reply to
their diplomacy..

241
00:20:38,531 --> 00:20:39,949
..we can also use our own
diplomatic policies.

242
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:42,618
The policy which we have
adabted, by that..

243
00:20:42,702 --> 00:20:45,663
..not only government
will fall in trouble.

244
00:20:45,788 --> 00:20:48,541
But finally it will be
beneficial to the nation.

245
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,544
Nation will get wealthy,
powerful and self sufficient.

246
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:54,672
This policy is of ìSwadeshiî.

247
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,968
Today we invite you all,
be it man or woman..

248
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:03,431
..poor or rich, king or peasant.

249
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:08,477
Come, right from this moment
we take an oath..

250
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:12,314
..that we will reject foreign
goods, boycott them.

251
00:21:12,398 --> 00:21:16,360
And will accept with pleasure,
what ever lndian,

252
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:18,571
So far the way to progress
of our in house..

253
00:21:18,696 --> 00:21:20,656
..production were obstructed..

254
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,576
..by the English government
only for their own interest.

255
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:29,665
Our clothing came from abroad,
our sugar, and salt.

256
00:21:29,874 --> 00:21:32,835
Did you ever notice, that
how many of our dailies..

257
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:35,880
..usable are produced
in our country?

258
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:38,007
I don't know, whether
you have seen..

259
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,343
..the foreign shops at Calcutta

260
00:21:40,426 --> 00:21:41,469
But I saw it.

261
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:44,347
One will be stunned, if
they see the products..

262
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,599
..the decoration and other
aspects of these shops.

263
00:21:46,724 --> 00:21:49,727
Can't we raise this question
today, that why..

264
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:52,855
..our money will be transferred
to their treasury?

265
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,900
What is the right they have
by which they will

266
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:58,527
Don't you think that our nation's
poverty is responsible for it?

267
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:01,572
Don't you think that our
duty is to protest it?

268
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:04,575
Is the time has not come
to wipe out this..

269
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:07,620
If we do not pay attention
to this crime,

270
00:22:07,745 --> 00:22:09,455
If we stay lazy,

271
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,541
If these foreigner steel away
all our nation's wealth,

272
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:15,753
Then, how shall we look
into the future?

273
00:22:15,878 --> 00:22:17,546
That is why I tell
you my brothers,

274
00:22:17,672 --> 00:22:19,632
Now the time has come
to protest against..

275
00:22:19,757 --> 00:22:21,634
..the arrogance of this
English government.

276
00:22:21,801 --> 00:22:24,303
Now we can't hesitate anymore.

277
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,515
Now all of us have to take
the oath of Swadeshi.

278
00:22:27,682 --> 00:22:30,518
And the anthem which is going..

279
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:33,396
..to inspire us to
go with the oath,

280
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:36,649
With the power of which, the
Foundation of the British..

281
00:22:36,774 --> 00:22:39,485
..dynasty will be shaken,

282
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,737
Come, by pronouncing
that anthem,

283
00:22:41,821 --> 00:22:43,781
Ignoring all the danger ahead,

284
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:45,866
For the purpose of patriotism,
Offer our selves.

285
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,952
Hail motherland.

286
00:23:14,979 --> 00:23:16,981
How can you murmur
foreign tune as..

287
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:18,983
..even after hearing
such a lecture?

288
00:23:20,401 --> 00:23:22,445
Then what are the tunes
I should murmur?

289
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:28,951
Kirtan, Shyama Sangit,
Nidhu Babu's Tappa.

290
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:43,632
'lgnoring the grooming
beauty of a virgin'

291
00:23:43,758 --> 00:23:51,682
'Time passes away'

292
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:57,813
The gentleman is a
good orator indeed.

293
00:23:57,938 --> 00:23:59,857
Having good control
over language.

294
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,901
He used to take part
in college debates.

295
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:08,866
' A little smile and a mild
movement of her body' öö.

296
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:12,286
It was nice to see those
boys in saffron. - Yes.

297
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:22,630
' Her feet are like
flower petals'ö..

298
00:24:26,676 --> 00:24:28,636
How many days he is
going to stay here?

299
00:24:29,512 --> 00:24:31,639
Tomorrow he will
start for Rongpur.

300
00:24:33,683 --> 00:24:35,685
He has got some work there.

301
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,770
Do you want to be introduced?

302
00:24:39,397 --> 00:24:42,024
Hope I will not be able to talk
to him. What is the use then?

303
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:44,819
You will not be required
to say anithing.

304
00:24:45,528 --> 00:24:47,488
Every thing he will say only.

305
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:20,021
If he ask me some thing
about Swadeshi?

306
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:22,023
Simply answer it.

307
00:25:23,816 --> 00:25:26,777
I think what ever the gentleman
said was perfect.

308
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:29,697
Oh! I see.

309
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:34,618
If I wear English out fit,
perhaps he will be shocked.

310
00:25:37,997 --> 00:25:39,498
What should I wear?

311
00:25:53,012 --> 00:25:56,474
12th Aghrayan 1314

312
00:25:56,766 --> 00:25:58,726
The younger princes of
Sukhsayar stepped out..

313
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:00,728
..from the interior part
for the first time..

314
00:26:00,811 --> 00:26:02,605
..demolishing all the earlier
prejudice and customs.

315
00:27:03,749 --> 00:27:04,917
Greetings!

316
00:27:10,548 --> 00:27:12,591
She has agreed to take
the oath of Swadeshi..

317
00:27:12,717 --> 00:27:15,511
..after hearing your
lecture yasterday.

318
00:27:16,387 --> 00:27:19,598
What all are you taking Nikhil?
- I am taking about the fact.

319
00:27:21,392 --> 00:27:24,270
Come, have your seat.

320
00:27:26,397 --> 00:27:28,357
Be seated, Sandip.

321
00:27:30,568 --> 00:27:32,570
What happened to you? Be seated.

322
00:27:41,412 --> 00:27:46,542
Initially I couldn't
believe my eyes.

323
00:27:48,002 --> 00:27:50,546
Now I can not believe
my ears too.

324
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:53,466
He is exaggerating I suppose.

325
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:57,720
If two sixteenth of it turns
true, I will be obliged.

326
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,890
What ever I do in politics..

327
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:02,850
but the event you have
created is called..

328
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:04,977
..a social revolution,
which I witness.

329
00:28:05,353 --> 00:28:06,896
Hope I could understand
the value of it.

330
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:09,940
And I also understand
the fact that is..

331
00:28:10,024 --> 00:28:12,735
.. Nikhil may be your husband..

332
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,236
..but you are not his follower.

333
00:28:14,445 --> 00:28:16,489
You have got a personality
of your own.

334
00:28:17,615 --> 00:28:19,617
Because Nikhil doesn't
pay attention..

335
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,744
..to my words, but you paid it.

336
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:24,872
Please don't praise her further.
I will be in trouble then.

337
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:27,458
No use of saying these.

338
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:29,627
We are politicians, we
are totally shameless..

339
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,754
..about increasing
our party members.

340
00:28:32,963 --> 00:28:36,425
Till now, I do not have
a woman in my team.

341
00:28:36,592 --> 00:28:39,595
Off course, I can not be
assured that I have got one.

342
00:28:40,388 --> 00:28:42,264
But there is no hesitation
in saying that..

343
00:28:42,473 --> 00:28:43,974
..it is more prestigious
to have one.

344
00:28:45,393 --> 00:28:48,896
Ladies are having an inherent
intelligence..

345
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:52,024
..which we call intuition.

346
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:55,569
I do respect it from my heart.

347
00:28:56,612 --> 00:28:59,740
Male intelligence proves to
be nothing in front of it.

348
00:29:00,825 --> 00:29:02,410
What you say about it, Nikhil?

349
00:29:04,954 --> 00:29:07,748
Why don't you say some thing
about his yesterday's lecture?

350
00:29:07,957 --> 00:29:12,586
O yes, that is what I was
supposed to ask you.

351
00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:14,922
Tell me,

352
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:20,428
Do you feel what ever
I said, was wrong?

353
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:23,347
Please speak out,
don't hesitate.

354
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:26,267
I didn't even get time
to think over it.

355
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,436
That is why I am asking you.

356
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:31,522
Why should you have to think?
Rather he has to think.

357
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:33,274
Tell me what your heart
says about it.

358
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:35,443
Forget about intelligence.

359
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:39,447
Though I do not
understand much..

360
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,533
..but I can realize
one thing that..

361
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:45,536
..if English government has
done a wrong by dividing..

362
00:29:45,661 --> 00:29:47,538
.. Bengal we should not
accept it at all.

363
00:29:48,581 --> 00:29:51,625
If we do Swadeshi and it
brings their realization,

364
00:29:51,709 --> 00:29:53,294
Better do that.

365
00:29:55,671 --> 00:29:57,798
Of course it is also true
that if a small number..

366
00:29:57,882 --> 00:30:00,301
.. of people do this it will
create no impact at all.

367
00:30:00,676 --> 00:30:02,303
If the desire for Swadeshi
can be awakened into..

368
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:04,305
..the mind of a large
number of people..

369
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:05,514
..then only it will
be effective.

370
00:30:06,015 --> 00:30:07,475
Hundred times correct.

371
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:11,896
Hundred times correct.
This is my only duty.

372
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:14,315
Our anthem ìHail motherlandî
is only meant..

373
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:15,983
..for the purpose
of awakening people.

374
00:30:16,609 --> 00:30:20,071
Don't you think that our anthem
has got a great power?

375
00:30:20,613 --> 00:30:22,740
Have you ever tried
this anthem any time?

376
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:26,577
Try once.

377
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:30,414
You need not to pronounce it
loud, but you can murmur it.

378
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,501
Practically to say that,
yesterday when all were..

379
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:35,586
..pronouncing
ìHail motherlandî together,

380
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:38,714
Then it was likeö.
- Excitement?

381
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:42,343
It was really thrilling.

382
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:43,678
It was obvious.

383
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:46,597
Do you know that your husband..

384
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:48,599
..does not believe in our policy?

385
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:49,892
Am I right, Nikhil?

386
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:51,018
I think that you know that..

387
00:30:51,102 --> 00:30:53,020
..I do not have believe
in any addiction.

388
00:30:53,437 --> 00:30:54,605
Addiction?

389
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,607
What do you mean by addiction?

390
00:30:57,441 --> 00:30:59,443
Those who never thought
of their nation,

391
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:02,279
And if you try to make them
work for the nation,

392
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:04,448
You have no way than to make
them addicted, is not it?

393
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,951
But to make them do work,
is the basic Nikhil.

394
00:31:07,076 --> 00:31:08,619
But the work is essential.

395
00:31:09,412 --> 00:31:11,706
And the work will come through
the inspiration,

396
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:13,916
And the inspiration will
come through the anthem.

397
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,751
Don't you know the role
of the marseillance..

398
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:16,877
..song in French revolution?

399
00:31:17,003 --> 00:31:19,964
Presently the thing, which
is most important, is..

400
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:23,467
..to awaken a large number
of people together.

401
00:31:23,676 --> 00:31:26,595
Do you know that our poets are
composing patriotic songs?

402
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:28,639
These songs are being made to
motivate our people only.

403
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:30,391
Hve you headr the songs?

404
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:34,478
' Do you think you
are so powerful..

405
00:31:34,603 --> 00:31:36,480
..that you can
change the destiny?'

406
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:38,482
' Are you so powerful?'

407
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:41,318
' Do you think you are
so powerful..

408
00:31:41,444 --> 00:31:43,321
..that you can
change the destiny?'

409
00:31:43,446 --> 00:31:45,323
' Are you so powerful?'

410
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:48,326
'Just because you hold
the power over us..

411
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:50,328
..you take so much pride.'

412
00:31:50,536 --> 00:31:53,331
' Why take so much pride.'

413
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:55,499
' Do you think you
are so powerful..

414
00:31:55,624 --> 00:31:57,501
..that you can
change the destiny?'

415
00:31:57,626 --> 00:31:59,795
' Are you so powerful?'

416
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:02,465
'Just because you hold
the power over us..

417
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:04,467
..you take so much pride.'

418
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,678
' Why take so much pride.'

419
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:10,473
' You can change the destiny?'

420
00:32:10,598 --> 00:32:12,975
" Always you' ll pull us back'

421
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:14,977
' Always you' ll keep
us below you.'

422
00:32:21,067 --> 00:32:24,320
' You don't have
that much strength'

423
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:26,822
' Your strength
will not withstand.'

424
00:32:26,906 --> 00:32:29,659
' Do you think you are so powerful..

425
00:32:29,742 --> 00:32:31,661
..that you can change the destiny?'

426
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:34,330
' Are you so powerful?'

427
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:37,333
'Try as much to govern us '

428
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:39,335
' Even the weak have some strength.'

429
00:32:43,756 --> 00:32:48,511
' You may a great power.'

430
00:32:48,761 --> 00:32:51,347
'There is still the god above you.'

431
00:32:51,555 --> 00:33:00,439
' By killing our strength
even you will not survive.'

432
00:33:00,648 --> 00:33:05,277
' If your weight is very heavy.'

433
00:33:05,486 --> 00:33:07,613
' It will only pain your arms'

434
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:09,615
' Do you think you are so powerful..

435
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,617
..that you can change the destiny?'

436
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:14,286
' Are you so powerful?'

437
00:33:14,662 --> 00:33:17,456
'Just because you hold
the power over us..

438
00:33:17,665 --> 00:33:19,458
..you take so much pride.'

439
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,961
' Why take so much pride.'

440
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,380
' Do you think you are so powerful..

441
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:26,465
..that you can change the destiny?'

442
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,051
' Are you so powerful?'

443
00:33:30,428 --> 00:33:34,890
I really can not ignore that
the song is too good.

444
00:33:35,433 --> 00:33:37,560
Oh! What are these?

445
00:33:37,685 --> 00:33:40,479
Swadeshi tea, from Darjeening.

446
00:33:40,604 --> 00:33:41,731
No, no, tea is OK,

447
00:33:41,814 --> 00:33:43,315
But I am asking about
those accessories.

448
00:33:43,441 --> 00:33:45,568
You must take some sweets.

449
00:33:45,693 --> 00:33:47,320
Only tea can't be a limit.

450
00:33:47,445 --> 00:33:49,322
The sweets are not
only Swadeshi..

451
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,865
..but it is made by
Bimala herself.

452
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:52,575
Really.
- Yes.

453
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,660
In that case I must have to try.

454
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:57,330
Still I couldn't get control..

455
00:33:57,455 --> 00:33:58,831
..over the greed of
eating sweets.

456
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,249
Even I can see that
you are also failed..

457
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:01,709
..to stop smoking
foreign cigarettes.

458
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:04,795
That is impossible. Didn't you
see the lndian cigarettes

459
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:06,839
of spectacle and weighting
instrument symbolized?

460
00:34:06,964 --> 00:34:08,424
Irritating by look.

461
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:10,259
Better you can give it up.

462
00:34:10,468 --> 00:34:13,804
Talking about smoking? - Don't
you have that mental courage?

463
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,730
Ok, you join our team
and I will give up.

464
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:25,566
How much sugar?

465
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:27,651
If foreign, then one and
if lndian, then two.

466
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:40,456
Now tell me what is your plan?

467
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:42,917
Not yet settled up.

468
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:44,710
Your neighbor Jamindar..

469
00:34:44,835 --> 00:34:46,045
..Bhabesh
Kundu called me to see him.

470
00:34:49,423 --> 00:34:51,384
He is having an occasion
of giving up..

471
00:34:51,509 --> 00:34:53,010
..foreign cloths at his place.

472
00:34:53,094 --> 00:34:54,470
I will be there to
be guest in chief.

473
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,681
So I must go there once.

474
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:02,645
Madam Bimala, do you know
that whatever problem..

475
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:05,606
..I have is only about this
Jamindar friend of mine?

476
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,692
Is he not going to
help me at all?

477
00:35:08,776 --> 00:35:10,778
You will find many Jamindars
in the near vinicity..

478
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:12,446
..who are supporters
of Swadeshi.

479
00:35:13,656 --> 00:35:16,867
What's harm if you can drop
your working idea in my area?

480
00:35:16,993 --> 00:35:19,328
Did you hear your husband?

481
00:35:19,495 --> 00:35:21,956
There is not even a pinch
of patriotism in this man.

482
00:35:26,502 --> 00:35:29,547
Any way, leave it.

483
00:35:32,008 --> 00:35:33,634
So are you joining our team?

484
00:35:34,593 --> 00:35:36,554
Don't worry, you will
not be required..

485
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:38,556
..to put your name
in the register.

486
00:35:38,806 --> 00:35:41,475
You will be the same as you are.

487
00:35:41,726 --> 00:35:44,645
If required, I myself
will come down to you.

488
00:35:46,522 --> 00:35:47,815
What happened?
Speak out something.

489
00:35:47,898 --> 00:35:49,817
You have to give me word.

490
00:35:50,693 --> 00:35:52,987
Ok.
- Good.

491
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:54,655
So let me go now.

492
00:35:55,698 --> 00:35:56,741
Are you pushing off?

493
00:35:56,866 --> 00:35:58,576
Yes, I have many works today.

494
00:35:58,701 --> 00:36:00,786
My teammates are waiting
for me down stairs.

495
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:06,917
Bimala madam, today is really
a memorable day for me.

496
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:09,587
Only a single request to you,

497
00:36:09,754 --> 00:36:11,881
That you should only go
with your own beliefs.

498
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:14,425
Please don't get influenced
by this gentleman.

499
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:17,428
You can be rest assured
about it, Sandip.

500
00:36:18,387 --> 00:36:21,766
Today onwards my wife is
completely independent.

501
00:36:21,891 --> 00:36:23,684
Excellent, excellent.

502
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:26,604
Ok, I pushing off then.

503
00:36:26,729 --> 00:36:28,356
Let me come down stairs
to see you off.

504
00:37:14,527 --> 00:37:16,988
Hail motherland.

505
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:31,293
Hail motherland.

506
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:42,013
Still you didn't tell me.
- What?

507
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,016
How do you find my friend.

508
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:46,851
How much do you expect me to..

509
00:37:46,976 --> 00:37:48,436
..judge some one in
a single visit?

510
00:37:49,687 --> 00:37:50,896
I believe..

511
00:37:52,023 --> 00:37:54,984
..that it is better to know
Sandip as little as possible.

512
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:58,696
You are having a very little
similarity between your selves,

513
00:37:58,821 --> 00:38:00,823
Still then how can you two
take each other as friend..

514
00:38:00,948 --> 00:38:02,908
..I fail to understand.

515
00:38:04,535 --> 00:38:06,495
It happens to be Bimala.

516
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:11,959
Calculating can not solve
the equation of friendship.

517
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:16,964
Other than that, I am
his college friend.

518
00:38:18,716 --> 00:38:21,010
It's not true that, we were
not having similarities.

519
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:25,598
Both of us decided together
that we should not..

520
00:38:25,723 --> 00:38:29,018
..admit the superstitions
in our society.

521
00:38:30,478 --> 00:38:33,981
Of course, he was
always ahead of me.

522
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:39,570
Only because he didn't wanted to
marry a lady chosen by others,

523
00:38:39,654 --> 00:38:42,365
He disputed relation
with his parents.

524
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,582
Few days after our marriage
he asked me..

525
00:38:51,666 --> 00:38:53,959
..whether I will introduce
my wife to him or not.

526
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,048
After that, whenever he had
chance he used to remind me.

527
00:39:01,342 --> 00:39:04,387
Last of all he said that,
he doesn't believe..

528
00:39:04,512 --> 00:39:06,889
..what ever I had told
him regarding my wife.

529
00:39:12,937 --> 00:39:16,315
Do you know, what he told
me today? - What?

530
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:24,949
No, I won't disclose it.
- Why?

531
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:29,954
What all he can say through
a single visit?

532
00:39:31,372 --> 00:39:33,749
I can say much more than he can.

533
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:36,627
You never say any thing.

534
00:39:38,629 --> 00:39:40,631
Is it essential to
say it from mouth?

535
00:39:41,465 --> 00:39:43,884
Don't you have your intuition?

536
00:40:23,424 --> 00:40:26,469
Chhote rani maa.
- What happened Bhalku?

537
00:40:26,594 --> 00:40:28,554
Mr. Mukherji has sent
you this letter.

538
00:40:37,688 --> 00:40:41,484
Hope the custom was not meant
to be broke for a day.

539
00:40:41,609 --> 00:40:44,987
So, can I see you
once again now?

540
00:40:46,447 --> 00:40:48,824
Ok, tell him I am coming.
- Very nice.

541
00:40:52,787 --> 00:40:54,997
Krishna's tune irritating me,

542
00:40:55,665 --> 00:40:57,625
How can I stay back home?

543
00:41:46,716 --> 00:41:48,509
Hail motherland.

544
00:41:50,553 --> 00:41:51,595
He is not there at home.

545
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:55,808
I didn't come asking for him..
I came asking for you.

546
00:41:56,058 --> 00:41:57,727
Come, be seated.

547
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:05,026
No, no, you were hidden so far,

548
00:42:05,484 --> 00:42:08,362
So, now you can't
stay at a distance.

549
00:42:09,405 --> 00:42:12,033
Come and sit here.
Just beside me.

550
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,725
What happened?

551
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:41,979
Can't believe it.

552
00:42:43,606 --> 00:42:45,983
Since your marriage Nikhil
always assured me that..

553
00:42:46,108 --> 00:42:47,985
..he will introduce me to you.

554
00:42:48,653 --> 00:42:50,404
I couldn't believe it.

555
00:42:50,696 --> 00:42:53,824
Frankly speaking, still
I can't believe.

556
00:42:55,034 --> 00:42:57,953
So far I only heard about the
list of your good qualities.

557
00:42:58,537 --> 00:43:01,457
That you learned English from
an English woman, you like..

558
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,669
.. reading books you know
stitching, you know cooking,

559
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:07,963
What you love most to
cook, what to eat..

560
00:43:08,047 --> 00:43:11,300
..what is the flower you like,
I know all of it.

561
00:43:13,386 --> 00:43:15,346
In addition to that, l
know one more thing.

562
00:43:16,681 --> 00:43:21,352
You do not like that Nikhil
helps me by giving money.

563
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:25,815
So, now you can understand..that
you are not a stranger to me.

564
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,818
that
you are not a stranger to me.

565
00:43:30,027 --> 00:43:34,365
But I could never expected you
to come and sit beside me.

566
00:43:35,408 --> 00:43:38,452
Had you been to Rongpur?
- Yes.

567
00:43:38,577 --> 00:43:41,038
How was the tour?
- Very nice.

568
00:43:41,414 --> 00:43:44,834
So I wanted to see you
in the early morning.

569
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:48,587
Hope you have to go again.

570
00:43:48,713 --> 00:43:50,798
Where?
- At Rangpur.

571
00:43:50,881 --> 00:43:53,050
You will make that your
job centre. Isn't it?

572
00:43:54,427 --> 00:43:57,763
I thought this earlier.
But now I don't wish to.

573
00:43:58,723 --> 00:43:59,682
Then?

574
00:44:02,393 --> 00:44:04,437
Let me tell you openly that, my
desire is to get intimate..

575
00:44:04,562 --> 00:44:06,522
..to you and work.

576
00:44:09,984 --> 00:44:12,445
As the bees work around
the queen bee..

577
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:14,447
..you will be our queen bee.

578
00:44:16,741 --> 00:44:18,284
Do you have any objection?

579
00:44:19,827 --> 00:44:23,873
But, will you not have problem
to work from here?

580
00:44:29,503 --> 00:44:30,504
Yes.

581
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:38,971
Nikhil will not take it easily.

582
00:44:43,434 --> 00:44:45,478
But you know what?

583
00:44:47,772 --> 00:44:49,982
I am basically..

584
00:44:53,486 --> 00:44:54,528
..a stubborn man.

585
00:44:56,781 --> 00:44:59,784
I am not at all ready to
admit Nikhil's objection.

586
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:08,542
I want to establish Swadeshi
here in Sukhsayar.

587
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,921
And in connection to that,
I need your help.

588
00:45:13,381 --> 00:45:16,008
But I know nothing
about your job.

589
00:45:16,384 --> 00:45:18,427
All I know is you
deliver lectures.

590
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:20,513
Is this the job all about?

591
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:24,558
Of course that is
a job, a major job.

592
00:45:25,643 --> 00:45:27,937
Some times it is the
lecture which works.

593
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:34,735
Wait, if you really want
to know about my job,

594
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:36,779
Then read this.

595
00:45:38,489 --> 00:45:40,491
You will come to know every
thing, if you read this.

596
00:45:40,616 --> 00:45:41,951
The resolution of struggle.

597
00:45:45,413 --> 00:45:47,373
Definitely I will go through it.

598
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:50,918
Now let's talk serious.

599
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:55,798
In this area Sukhsayar is
the biggest market area.

600
00:45:55,923 --> 00:45:58,467
Hope you know that?
- I heard it.

601
00:45:59,343 --> 00:46:02,430
This is the only place nearby,
where buying and selling..

602
00:46:02,513 --> 00:46:04,515
..of foreign goods
is still going on.

603
00:46:04,807 --> 00:46:06,767
In other places, the jamindars
themselves..

604
00:46:06,851 --> 00:46:08,602
..stopped this happening.

605
00:46:08,686 --> 00:46:10,312
But Nikhil hasn't.

606
00:46:11,355 --> 00:46:13,607
I will do what I can.

607
00:46:13,983 --> 00:46:18,446
But if you help, it
will be easy for us.

608
00:46:18,863 --> 00:46:22,533
I think you are over
estimating my power.

609
00:46:22,658 --> 00:46:24,285
Not at all.

610
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:28,664
Nikhil might be my friend,
but he is your husband.

611
00:46:28,914 --> 00:46:31,709
Your influence on him
is more than mine.

612
00:46:32,001 --> 00:46:33,961
Don't forget that my
husband does not..

613
00:46:34,045 --> 00:46:35,629
..change his decision easily.

614
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,465
I know.

615
00:46:38,382 --> 00:46:41,010
But if you say, I think
it will be possible.

616
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:48,351
I know how Nikhil esteems you.

617
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,895
Will you try for once?

618
00:46:54,398 --> 00:46:57,401
If Nikhil orders the farmers,
they are bound to listen to it.

619
00:46:57,526 --> 00:46:59,403
Nikhil will ask them
not to keep..

620
00:46:59,528 --> 00:47:01,238
..the foreign goods
in the market.

621
00:47:01,697 --> 00:47:03,658
Even if he doesn't
listen to me then?

622
00:47:03,866 --> 00:47:06,827
You just try. I will be happy.

623
00:47:07,953 --> 00:47:09,413
If you don't come
out with a result..

624
00:47:09,538 --> 00:47:10,539
..I will do whatever
has to be done.

625
00:47:10,665 --> 00:47:13,000
And that I will inform the
queen bee of course.

626
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,462
So, can I depend on you?

627
00:47:17,963 --> 00:47:19,256
I will try.

628
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:30,685
The more I see you,
The more I like you.

629
00:47:42,405 --> 00:47:44,490
Then I make a ö..

630
00:47:44,615 --> 00:47:46,701
Yes. You can leave.
You are free.

631
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:51,789
Well listen.

632
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,460
One of your object..

633
00:48:02,633 --> 00:48:07,763
This is the only foreign
object, I will keep with me.

634
00:48:12,643 --> 00:48:14,937
Did you meet Sandip today?

635
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,523
Yes.

636
00:48:20,526 --> 00:48:21,652
What does he say?

637
00:48:23,487 --> 00:48:25,489
He is in tension.

638
00:48:25,614 --> 00:48:26,657
Why?

639
00:48:28,576 --> 00:48:30,578
Will you not allow
him to do Swadeshi?

640
00:48:30,703 --> 00:48:32,455
Why shouldn't l?

641
00:48:32,538 --> 00:48:34,290
You have heard it.

642
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:38,461
Let him do Swadeshi
in any other place.

643
00:48:40,379 --> 00:48:42,340
He is telling he will stay here.

644
00:48:43,674 --> 00:48:45,343
Here?

645
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:47,470
That's what he is saying.

646
00:48:48,012 --> 00:48:50,014
He will do his job
from here only.

647
00:48:52,683 --> 00:48:54,018
He will be wrong then.

648
00:48:55,686 --> 00:48:57,813
In the entire Bengal,
Swadeshi is on.

649
00:48:57,938 --> 00:48:59,565
Why do you object?

650
00:48:59,857 --> 00:49:01,901
Asking me to do Swadeshi means.

651
00:49:02,026 --> 00:49:04,820
To stop foreign trading
in my market.

652
00:49:05,613 --> 00:49:08,574
Harish Kundu can
Do that, not me.

653
00:49:09,367 --> 00:49:11,911
But this market belongs to you.
Why can't you do it?

654
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:14,413
It is not my market.

655
00:49:14,622 --> 00:49:17,917
Those who sell their goods,
market belongs to them.

656
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:20,252
They are poor.

657
00:49:20,711 --> 00:49:23,756
Foreign goods are cheaper
and qualitatively..

658
00:49:23,881 --> 00:49:25,758
..better than that of
the lndian goods.

659
00:49:27,718 --> 00:49:30,346
That is what the poor villagers
could afford to buy.

660
00:49:30,471 --> 00:49:32,431
And you expect me to
stop it by force?

661
00:49:34,558 --> 00:49:38,437
Swadeshi is for those
who are moneyed.

662
00:49:38,646 --> 00:49:40,439
And not for the poor.

663
00:49:45,403 --> 00:49:46,445
What are you thinking?

664
00:49:47,655 --> 00:49:50,658
The poor will not suffer
and simultaneously..

665
00:49:50,783 --> 00:49:53,786
..Swadeshi will also run,
is it not possible?

666
00:49:55,788 --> 00:49:59,709
If it can be so, I will
definitely support Swadeshi.

667
00:50:00,001 --> 00:50:03,004
So, according to you Swadeshi
itself is wrong.

668
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:06,298
People will not take it wrong,
as because I feel so.

669
00:50:06,507 --> 00:50:08,968
The entire country has
gone mad with Swadeshi.

670
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,430
As you found Sandip's
dialogs correct..

671
00:50:12,555 --> 00:50:14,473
..Iike wise many others
can find it true.

672
00:50:16,517 --> 00:50:19,478
But I believe that putting
pressure on poor..

673
00:50:19,603 --> 00:50:22,565
..a nation can not progress.

674
00:50:28,612 --> 00:50:30,573
I think you can not
accept these words.

675
00:50:31,866 --> 00:50:34,493
I haven't thought it that way.

676
00:50:34,702 --> 00:50:36,329
What I thought was,
some thing has..

677
00:50:36,537 --> 00:50:37,830
..to be done under
such conditions.

678
00:50:37,955 --> 00:50:39,915
If people face trouble
now, ultimately..

679
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:42,001
..it could have turned
into a better tomorrow.

680
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,420
Those who are in Swadeshi,
hope they are doing..

681
00:50:44,545 --> 00:50:46,339
..so by loving their nation.

682
00:50:46,714 --> 00:50:49,675
I guess that most of them are
imagining a statue of the..

683
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,887
.. nation in their mind and
trying to love that.

684
00:50:53,054 --> 00:50:55,014
A motherly statue.

685
00:50:56,474 --> 00:50:59,560
Nation is our mother,
worshipping to that mother..

686
00:50:59,643 --> 00:51:03,773
..taking care of that mother,
praying to that mother,

687
00:51:03,898 --> 00:51:06,442
What ever you do is
only for the mother..

688
00:51:06,567 --> 00:51:09,278
..so that you can remove
the mother's pain.

689
00:51:10,404 --> 00:51:12,782
I understand and
I am sure that..

690
00:51:12,907 --> 00:51:15,451
..this issue can win
the hearts of women.

691
00:51:15,576 --> 00:51:17,912
I can understand your
feelings Bimala.

692
00:51:18,621 --> 00:51:20,706
But I can't accept it.

693
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:45,982
What ever you spoke to me..

694
00:51:46,107 --> 00:51:48,734
..today are they your
own entire version?

695
00:51:48,859 --> 00:51:50,528
Why such question?

696
00:51:50,778 --> 00:51:52,947
No, actually I felt
that you are trying..

697
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:55,783
..to vouch on behalf of Sandip.

698
00:51:55,866 --> 00:51:56,951
Sandip babu may be your friend..

699
00:51:57,034 --> 00:51:58,661
..but he is none to me I suppose.

700
00:52:00,579 --> 00:52:02,957
I thought you two have
Started..

701
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,001
..honest work for the nation.

702
00:52:05,835 --> 00:52:09,880
He is tackling the outer world
and you are handling the home.

703
00:52:10,006 --> 00:52:11,298
What a language!

704
00:52:18,681 --> 00:52:20,683
Will you conduct meetings
regularly?

705
00:52:21,392 --> 00:52:23,477
These dialogs do not make any
sense, since it was you..

706
00:52:23,561 --> 00:52:25,980
..who took me out
to the outer world.

707
00:52:36,699 --> 00:52:41,329
Sorry Bimala, but I asked
you a simple question.

708
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:43,914
I never done it to hurt you.

709
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,710
Ok, if you are so worried, then
I will not go out side any more.

710
00:52:48,627 --> 00:52:52,048
Don't make mistake Bimala,
I am not at all worried.

711
00:52:52,882 --> 00:52:54,842
I know both of you.

712
00:52:54,925 --> 00:52:56,510
Why should I worry then?

713
00:52:56,594 --> 00:52:57,595
And why will you restrict your
self to..

714
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,721
..going outside? What for?

715
00:52:58,846 --> 00:53:00,723
It's my will and that's
why I will not go.

716
00:53:01,557 --> 00:53:03,517
This is simply a grievance.

717
00:53:03,601 --> 00:53:04,602
I went out for two days.

718
00:53:04,727 --> 00:53:06,687
It's not necessary that l
have to go out regularly.

719
00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:10,524
It's ok.

720
00:53:20,576 --> 00:53:22,370
From my side, there are no
Restrictions..

721
00:53:22,578 --> 00:53:25,373
..regarding your movement.

722
00:53:26,666 --> 00:53:28,376
I have told you earlier,

723
00:53:29,502 --> 00:53:31,295
That you are completely free.

724
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:36,467
But yes, I would like
to say one thing that,

725
00:53:38,636 --> 00:53:40,596
If you say that you would
not like to wear..

726
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,473
..those foreign
dresses any more,

727
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,641
If you say that
you would not like..

728
00:53:43,766 --> 00:53:44,767
..to use those foreign perfumes,

729
00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:47,853
Foreign soaps, foreign shoes..

730
00:53:47,979 --> 00:53:49,981
..I will not at all
show any objection.

731
00:53:50,648 --> 00:53:52,817
But, if I try to remove foreign
goods from my market..

732
00:53:54,443 --> 00:54:00,866
..I have to hurt my
own beliefs and principles.

733
00:54:01,701 --> 00:54:04,328
This I cannot do Bimala.

734
00:54:10,376 --> 00:54:13,004
I can not take Swadeshi
so lightly Bimala.

735
00:54:17,591 --> 00:54:20,886
This much is mine, weak
people say like this.

736
00:54:21,012 --> 00:54:22,972
And they are the invalid
people who listen to it.

737
00:54:23,389 --> 00:54:25,808
What ever I can snatch
off, is mine.

738
00:54:26,017 --> 00:54:27,977
This is what the
world taught us.

739
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:30,479
As because I took birth in
the country, the country..

740
00:54:30,563 --> 00:54:33,316
.. belongs to me we
do not believe it.

741
00:54:33,399 --> 00:54:35,568
The nation can be mine only
if I could rob it to me.

742
00:54:35,651 --> 00:54:37,653
Then only the nation
could be mine.

743
00:54:43,034 --> 00:54:45,578
At the occasion of the
cremation of the foreign trade,

744
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:47,496
At your village,

745
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:50,374
It is the first fire of
cremation lighted on.

746
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:52,626
This ash is holy.

747
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,962
Hail motherland.

748
00:54:55,087 --> 00:54:57,381
Hail motherland.

749
00:55:09,477 --> 00:55:14,440
Special requirement,
Nation's work.

750
00:55:25,409 --> 00:55:28,704
Give it to chhoto rani ma.
- Very good.

751
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:11,914
Rani ma is not well, Babu.

752
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:17,503
Ok.

753
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:30,599
Hope you are known
to Master mosai?

754
00:56:30,725 --> 00:56:31,934
Yes, of course.

755
00:56:33,561 --> 00:56:35,271
Good morning, hope
you are well to do?

756
00:56:36,397 --> 00:56:38,274
Will you leave us to stay good?

757
00:56:42,486 --> 00:56:43,529
What's the matter?

758
00:56:43,654 --> 00:56:47,033
He couldn't even see his
students since your arrival.

759
00:56:48,659 --> 00:56:51,454
Hope you know that,
work for the nation..

760
00:56:51,579 --> 00:56:54,582
..plays a major role in
character building?

761
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:57,710
One of the student of Bhawan's..

762
00:56:57,793 --> 00:56:58,836
..school influenced by Swadeshi,

763
00:56:58,961 --> 00:57:01,630
Hit stone at Miss Gilbey,
the miss of the Governor

764
00:57:01,756 --> 00:57:04,592
And she had a head injury

765
00:57:04,842 --> 00:57:07,928
Will you consider this as an
instance of building character?

766
00:57:08,346 --> 00:57:10,264
I guess you are
forgetting that..

767
00:57:10,473 --> 00:57:11,474
..it happened prior
to my arrival here.

768
00:57:11,766 --> 00:57:14,310
So, you can't blame me for that.

769
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:17,855
And after all where there is
such a big movement going on,

770
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,857
How can you expect that such few..

771
00:57:19,982 --> 00:57:21,984
..incidents will not take place?

772
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,278
Even you have pulled out the
best student of my school..

773
00:57:24,362 --> 00:57:25,404
..towards your team.

774
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:27,615
Who is it? Amulya?
- Yes.

775
00:57:28,658 --> 00:57:30,618
If he would have appeared in
the examination this time

776
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:32,286
He would have claimed
schollership

777
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:33,871
It's you who has closed
that chance for him.

778
00:57:33,996 --> 00:57:37,625
Why should I pull him? He
joined by his own will.

779
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:40,461
You are also having many
of them in your team..,

780
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:42,546
..who are commonly called
vagabond, inefficient

781
00:57:42,672 --> 00:57:45,341
Those who are rather rachides
of our village, is not it?

782
00:57:45,508 --> 00:57:47,885
They are no more vagabond
Chandranath Babu.

783
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:50,554
They all are working today.
They are workers.

784
00:57:50,805 --> 00:57:52,890
Presently in this village
every body is working..

785
00:57:53,015 --> 00:57:54,725
..except two persons.

786
00:57:54,892 --> 00:57:56,477
One of those are you,

787
00:57:57,603 --> 00:57:59,313
And the other one is
None other than..

788
00:57:59,438 --> 00:58:01,399
..your ex student Nikhilesh
Choudhury.

789
00:58:01,565 --> 00:58:04,527
I repent for been unable to
pull this man to my team.

790
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:07,238
He can't stand Swadeshi
just like you.

791
00:58:07,363 --> 00:58:10,241
No, he never refuses
to be Swadeshi,

792
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:12,410
He does it, whenever he
Listens about a destructive..

793
00:58:12,535 --> 00:58:13,995
..Swadeshi like you.

794
00:58:14,453 --> 00:58:16,706
He started Swadeshi much
Before than of you.

795
00:58:16,831 --> 00:58:18,708
And for that he never
had to depend upon..

796
00:58:18,833 --> 00:58:19,834
..any heart-melting anthem.

797
00:58:19,959 --> 00:58:22,420
That I know.
- You know nothing.

798
00:58:22,545 --> 00:58:24,505
Do you know about
his Swadeshi Bank?

799
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:27,341
About Swadeshi sugar factory,
soap factory.

800
00:58:27,466 --> 00:58:31,595
Do you know he fixed looms
and produced disee cloths?

801
00:58:31,721 --> 00:58:32,888
Do you know that?

802
00:58:33,472 --> 00:58:35,683
Where was your Swadeshi
at that time?

803
00:58:35,766 --> 00:58:37,935
And your Vande Mataram?

804
00:58:38,602 --> 00:58:39,812
How much money he has
spent upon Swadeshi..

805
00:58:39,895 --> 00:58:40,938
..do you have any idea?

806
00:58:41,063 --> 00:58:42,273
Please don't get exited
Master mosai.

807
00:58:42,481 --> 00:58:45,609
Will you keep quite?
- I must have to say some thing.

808
00:58:45,776 --> 00:58:47,737
What's wrong with
him I don't know?

809
00:58:47,862 --> 00:58:49,822
If both of our destinations
are the same..

810
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:52,491
..then why is he not coming
and joining our team?

811
00:58:52,616 --> 00:58:55,703
Intentions are not the same.
There are many differences.

812
00:58:55,786 --> 00:59:00,249
You made your selves leader and
running after self-fulfillment.

813
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:02,418
Not even thinking about
the people of the nation.

814
00:59:02,543 --> 00:59:04,837
Nikhil never thought
about himself.

815
00:59:05,338 --> 00:59:07,631
You people are getting claps,
people are dancing..

816
00:59:07,757 --> 00:59:09,633
..with you being excited.

817
00:59:10,634 --> 00:59:12,595
He had taunts in return.

818
00:59:13,763 --> 00:59:15,723
As he was not gifted
by material senses.

819
00:59:15,848 --> 00:59:17,600
So the Swadeshi didn't last.

820
00:59:17,683 --> 00:59:19,644
But his path was the right one.

821
00:59:20,478 --> 00:59:21,771
Your's is wrong.

822
00:59:21,854 --> 00:59:25,316
Not only wrong, it is harm
full to the nation.

823
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:26,651
Dangerous.

824
00:59:27,943 --> 00:59:29,654
Come give it to me.

825
00:59:30,655 --> 00:59:32,657
I shall come on the other half.

826
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:39,914
O my father!
