1
00:00:14,018 --> 00:00:15,157
Stop!

2
00:00:15,324 --> 00:00:16,782
Damn you!

3
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:18,532
Stop! Stop!

4
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:20,955
Stop! Stop! I'm warning you!

5
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:23,532
If I get my hands on
you I will pulverize you!

6
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:27,187
Stop, you scumbag!
You won't stop running!

7
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,070
You scumbag!

8
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:40,157
Scoundrel! I will pulverize you.

9
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:41,549
Damn druggy!

10
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:43,174
Stop! Stop!

11
00:00:45,116 --> 00:00:46,866
You jackass!

12
00:00:49,074 --> 00:00:50,449
Stop!

13
00:00:57,241 --> 00:00:58,324
Scoundrel!

14
00:00:59,157 --> 00:01:01,516
Hey! Not inside! Not inside! Damn you!

15
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:07,090
Damn you! Scoundrel!

16
00:01:21,976 --> 00:01:24,721
Damn you! Scoundrel!

17
00:01:26,032 --> 00:01:27,952
Damn you!
Scoundrel! You dog! Come here!

18
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:30,616
Cool down, Rano.
You will explode. You will explode.

19
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:31,574
What are you doing?

20
00:01:31,657 --> 00:01:33,532
Come here. Come here. Come here.

21
00:01:33,616 --> 00:01:35,869
One moment. One moment.
Tell me what he has done.

22
00:01:35,949 --> 00:01:36,741
Ask him!

23
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:37,824
That's what I don't know.

24
00:01:37,907 --> 00:01:41,074
Aunty, he had parked his
Pajero over there. I only honked.

25
00:01:41,241 --> 00:01:43,505
- You honked, you scoundrel?
- Stop. Stop.

26
00:01:44,407 --> 00:01:46,407
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

27
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:48,657
What am I doing?
Ask him. Tell the truth.

28
00:01:48,737 --> 00:01:50,366
Did you honk on seeing my Pajero..

29
00:01:50,449 --> 00:01:51,866
..or did you honk on
seeing Satinder's sister?

30
00:01:51,949 --> 00:01:54,244
- Scoundrel! Son of a gun!
- What son of a gun, dad?

31
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:57,536
He has increased noise pollution
honking all over the village.

32
00:01:57,616 --> 00:02:00,411
Fantastic!
My honking is noise pollution to me.

33
00:02:00,491 --> 00:02:02,577
The girl who was sitting
on your scooty beeping.

34
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:05,078
That did not seem like
noise pollution to you?

35
00:02:05,449 --> 00:02:07,902
Someone was honking
and someone was beeping..

36
00:02:07,982 --> 00:02:10,949
..but why are you going around
the village acting like James Bond?

37
00:02:11,574 --> 00:02:12,657
Hold on.

38
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:14,449
Where is the Pajero?

39
00:02:14,741 --> 00:02:18,161
Daddy, I've told him before.
Mind your own business.

40
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:19,282
You don't pay heed, do you?

41
00:02:19,366 --> 00:02:21,077
Sure. You mind your
own business as well.

42
00:02:21,157 --> 00:02:23,369
Learn how to handle
your wife and kids first.

43
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:27,032
Don't even try to handle us.
- We will handle ourselves.

44
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:29,449
You have made your
children so bad-mannered

45
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:31,616
This is all you can do.

46
00:02:31,907 --> 00:02:33,536
Don't bother getting a job.

47
00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:36,116
Why are you telling me? Injustice
was being done in front of me..

48
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,032
Hey, injustice! Listen to me.

49
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,119
Are you a Superman or Spiderman?

50
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,327
You feel compelled to do justice
where injustice is being done.

51
00:02:45,407 --> 00:02:46,199
Yes, I feel compelled.

52
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:47,574
Yes, he feels compelled, dad.

53
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:48,744
He's talking nonsense!

54
00:02:48,824 --> 00:02:51,324
Today he was beating one person
because of Satinder's sister..

55
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:52,202
..and the other day.

56
00:02:52,282 --> 00:02:53,282
What about the other day?
What about the other day?

57
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:56,119
The other day he was beating
Satinder because of someone else.

58
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,116
Yes, I will beat Satinder
if he eve teases a girl.

59
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,324
If he eve teases!

60
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:00,949
- Grandpa.
- Yes.

61
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:03,411
You wanted to know
about the Pajero, right?

62
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:05,949
Yes. Tell me where the Pajero is.

63
00:03:06,532 --> 00:03:07,661
I will bring the Pajero..

64
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:08,661
..but clam him down first.

65
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:10,449
He's been wailing since I got here.

66
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:12,994
Listen to that.
He is always on my son's back.

67
00:03:13,074 --> 00:03:15,824
I told you not to cross your limits.
I am warning you.

68
00:03:15,907 --> 00:03:16,741
You don't cross your limits, uncle..

69
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:17,741
and don't let your kids
cross their limits.

70
00:03:17,824 --> 00:03:19,074
Someday I shall stuff
a sock in his mouth.

71
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,657
- I'll slap you!
- Slap me.

72
00:03:21,741 --> 00:03:24,957
What is he saying?
He cannot handle his children.

73
00:03:28,236 --> 00:03:30,116
You shut him up.

74
00:03:31,508 --> 00:03:34,396
What am I supposed to
do with this thing? Go there.

75
00:03:36,124 --> 00:03:38,444
Have you lost your mind?

76
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:49,824
Calm down!
Calm down! Mummy. Mummy. Are you deaf?

77
00:03:50,524 --> 00:03:51,699
I told you to calm down.

78
00:03:52,074 --> 00:03:53,824
You have turned this
house into a fish market.

79
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:55,949
I don't want to live
in this fish market.

80
00:03:56,324 --> 00:03:58,949
I am going to aunt's house in Delhi,
okay. I want peace of mind.

81
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:01,321
Does anyone in this house
know what peace of mind is?

82
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,324
You understand? Peace of mind.

83
00:04:03,741 --> 00:04:05,907
What is it?
What? Why are you laughing?

84
00:04:06,241 --> 00:04:08,699
You waste my petrol driving
all over the village.

85
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,366
What will you do in Delhi?

86
00:04:10,657 --> 00:04:12,574
You will burden your aunt, right?

87
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:15,621
Firstly, dad,
I don't waste petrol, I waste diesel.

88
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:17,327
Both of them cost money.

89
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:19,491
It costs money to
service the cars too..

90
00:04:19,574 --> 00:04:21,369
which I do for free.
You never talk about that.

91
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:22,491
- Really?
- Yes.

92
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,161
The Pajero key.

93
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:26,619
The key of your Pajero is
in the ignition of the Pajero..

94
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,866
..and your Pajero is
parked next to Lala's shop.

95
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:31,407
Tell your earning son
to go and bring the Pajero.

96
00:04:31,574 --> 00:04:32,449
And let me tell you something.

97
00:04:32,532 --> 00:04:34,241
You are so conceited about the car.

98
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:35,574
A day will come when

99
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:39,449
I will change cars to
match my shoe color. Okay?

100
00:04:39,532 --> 00:04:41,241
Yellow Lamborghini. Red Ferrari.

101
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:46,275
The servants at my house won't
go to buy veggies in your Pajero.

102
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:49,824
This is a mental asylum.
I don't want to live here.

103
00:04:58,574 --> 00:04:59,657
Taxi.

104
00:05:01,032 --> 00:05:02,366
Taxi.

105
00:05:20,565 --> 00:05:22,157
Hey! Switch that off.

106
00:05:22,786 --> 00:05:24,616
Why, brother? What is the matter?

107
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,324
Because the passenger says so.
I am the passenger. Switch it off.

108
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:30,782
The passengers only think
about themselves, brother.

109
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:33,699
Nobody understands
the pain of us drivers.

110
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,449
We get into such a terrible state..

111
00:05:35,532 --> 00:05:38,116
..plying the car from
here to there all day long.

112
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:41,241
When we play a little
music it makes us feel better.

113
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:42,907
Listen to me, your highness.

114
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:46,574
You will stop feeling
better if I slap you.

115
00:05:47,241 --> 00:05:48,907
I told you to switch if off.
Switch it off, scumbag!

116
00:05:49,074 --> 00:05:50,116
Okay.

117
00:05:57,768 --> 00:06:00,616
Brother, you appear to be from Punjab.

118
00:06:02,741 --> 00:06:05,282
How does it matter whether
I am from Punjab or from Kanyakumari?

119
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,616
I am the passenger. When I told you
to switch it off, you switch it off.

120
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:11,157
End of story. I have come
to this city looking for peace..

121
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:12,782
..and you are playing songs.

122
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:14,949
Peace? In Delhi?

123
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,906
Bang-bang. Bang-bang.

124
00:06:44,986 --> 00:06:46,867
The sound goes on till 3 AM in the night.

125
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,464
Till 3 AM?

126
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:51,954
What is it you do, sister?
Your husband isn't here.

127
00:06:52,034 --> 00:06:54,996
Sure, she has visitors.

128
00:06:55,076 --> 00:06:56,954
She has so many visitors, Rani,

129
00:06:57,034 --> 00:06:58,409
you will lose count of them.

130
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:01,617
- Take that. Peace.
- You don't understand.

131
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:04,201
The body has needs.

132
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:06,659
One has to fulfil those needs.

133
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,576
- Right, sister?
- You are right, aunty.

134
00:07:08,656 --> 00:07:11,621
I think the needs of her
bank account are being fulfilled..

135
00:07:11,701 --> 00:07:13,784
..along with her body's needs.

136
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:17,409
Look. You are crossing the line now.

137
00:07:17,492 --> 00:07:21,287
- Sounds come from every house..
- Sure, but they are no so loud.

138
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:23,326
Well, we don't have any secrets.

139
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,034
We are discussing
things everyone knows.

140
00:07:26,244 --> 00:07:30,242
That's right. Our street
has a bad reputation because of you.

141
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:33,034
Huge cars come here.

142
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:35,409
They have cash transactions.

143
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:36,159
What are you saying?

144
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:39,951
What are you saying? - And condoms
are found in the bin the next day.

145
00:07:41,492 --> 00:07:45,579
Imagine. How can a girl become
pregnant without her husband?

146
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:48,742
Wow! Hats off to your passion!

147
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:54,284
You guys wake up at 3 AM to listen
to the sounds coming from my house.

148
00:07:54,364 --> 00:07:56,076
You check my garbage.

149
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,159
It is clear what
you have on your minds.

150
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:03,826
I think that your
passion is running over..

151
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:07,867
..because your passion
is lacking, brother.

152
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:11,409
What do you mean?

153
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:15,909
I mean if you show your passion
at the right time in the night..

154
00:08:16,451 --> 00:08:18,284
she won't have so
much garbage on her mind.

155
00:08:18,992 --> 00:08:21,287
And if your passion is
somewhat lacking these days..

156
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,034
..medicines are available
on the internet these days.

157
00:08:23,326 --> 00:08:24,909
They can be delivered at home,
brother.

158
00:08:25,076 --> 00:08:28,162
Are you corrupting my husband?

159
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:29,876
I was saying..

160
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:30,906
Come with me, aunty.

161
00:08:30,986 --> 00:08:32,739
I shall show you where
the sounds come from.

162
00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:34,403
What are you doing?

163
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:39,909
Why are you so afraid? Are
you going to Baba Ram rahim's house?

164
00:08:40,284 --> 00:08:43,784
No. Don't you trust his character?

165
00:08:44,284 --> 00:08:47,119
Stop it. I am getting late for office.

166
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:49,451
Let's go and tend to our homes.

167
00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:51,659
It's not going to make
any difference to her.

168
00:08:51,742 --> 00:08:55,454
In any case, who can talk to a girl
whose parents we know nothing about?

169
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:59,016
Sure. The people whose parents
are known are so very classy, right?

170
00:08:59,534 --> 00:09:02,246
You are setting such
a good example for your kids.

171
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:03,742
Shame on you!

172
00:09:05,617 --> 00:09:09,776
Go! You go! And what are you watching?
The scene is over. Go!

173
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:13,814
Go! You go!

174
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:16,320
You? Do you also have questions?

175
00:09:17,617 --> 00:09:18,816
My aunt's house.

176
00:09:30,558 --> 00:09:32,756
Come. Come. Come. Come. Take this.

177
00:09:32,836 --> 00:09:34,933
Aunt, this is a nice society.

178
00:09:35,013 --> 00:09:37,099
Yes. It is really very nice.

179
00:09:44,492 --> 00:09:46,053
How was your journey?

180
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:47,237
Don't ask, aunt.

181
00:09:47,317 --> 00:09:49,707
It wasn't a journey.
It was suffering. It was very bad!

182
00:09:49,787 --> 00:09:50,802
Oh!

183
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:53,216
Hush. Anyway, never mind that.
Look at this.

184
00:09:53,632 --> 00:09:54,591
What are you doing?

185
00:09:54,674 --> 00:09:56,049
Selfie.

186
00:09:56,132 --> 00:09:57,924
- I see.
- Smile.

187
00:10:01,632 --> 00:10:05,424
The people here in
the colony have FOMO.

188
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,549
FOMO. What is that?

189
00:10:10,632 --> 00:10:12,757
Fear of missing out.

190
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:17,966
Let me tell everyone
who has come to my house.

191
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:24,591
Hash, my handsome
boy has come to my house.

192
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:28,382
Send.

193
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:30,049
Handsome.

194
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:32,882
- Son.
- Yes.

195
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,549
Do you want black
coffee or milk coffee?

196
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:37,091
What is this, aunt?

197
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:40,594
Silly chap.
This is called a French press.

198
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:42,424
I see.

199
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:49,341
Mrs. Khurana saw it
and she commented too.

200
00:10:51,174 --> 00:10:55,049
Rani hasn't seen it as yet.
It's okay. She must be busy.

201
00:11:01,131 --> 00:11:04,886
- Hey. Hey. Don't look over there.
- Huh?

202
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:06,799
- Don't look over there.
- What's the matter? What's the matter?

203
00:11:07,174 --> 00:11:08,466
She is a witch. A witch!

204
00:11:08,632 --> 00:11:09,924
She is a witch?
Yes.

205
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:12,632
She has sucked the
blood of so many men.

206
00:11:12,716 --> 00:11:13,466
Stop it, aunt.

207
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:15,799
I swear. I swear on God.

208
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:22,091
And I think the Bengali woman
is carrying this bearded man's child.

209
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,507
What do you mean you think?
Isn't he her husband?

210
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:27,007
God forgive me. We know nothing.

211
00:11:27,257 --> 00:11:30,201
Many men visit her house.

212
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:35,897
For some reason the Bengali
woman always picks up rich men.

213
00:11:36,882 --> 00:11:38,424
In that case, I am safe, aunt. -

214
00:11:38,507 --> 00:11:39,674
That's right.

215
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:57,174
He is leaping at 22 weeks.
He's a very active baby.

216
00:11:57,257 --> 00:11:59,174
But it won't happen so soon.

217
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:02,132
When do you want it?

218
00:12:02,341 --> 00:12:03,753
In two days.

219
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,216
What are you saying?

220
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:08,216
It will take 14 weeks
at the very least.

221
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:09,299
What? For this?

222
00:12:09,632 --> 00:12:10,924
I will make it in two days.

223
00:12:12,424 --> 00:12:14,466
Hey, madam. What's on your mind?

224
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,677
I am talking about this baby.

225
00:12:16,757 --> 00:12:19,750
Sorry. Sorry.
I was looking at Alia's dress.

226
00:12:19,924 --> 00:12:21,774
Look. It's a beautiful color,
isn't it?

227
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:25,142
It has great demand in the market.
2.5, Doctor.

228
00:12:25,924 --> 00:12:27,007
Come on.

229
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:30,257
You should take care of yourself.

230
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:34,396
I do. I eat broccoli. I eat eggs.
I eat fish. I even drink milk.

231
00:12:34,556 --> 00:12:35,971
And I'm even exercising these days.

232
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:37,507
- Okay. Take care.
- Bye, Doc.

233
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:38,674
Bye.

234
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:40,841
I hope all is well.

235
00:12:40,924 --> 00:12:43,591
- All is well.
- He is active today.

236
00:12:43,674 --> 00:12:45,174
Very nice.

237
00:12:45,591 --> 00:12:49,091
Listen. My wife called up.
I have to go.

238
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:50,844
Do you mind taking a cab?

239
00:12:50,924 --> 00:12:53,799
- It's okay?
- I'll take a cab.

240
00:13:07,012 --> 00:13:08,341
Take this, brother.

241
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:13,844
You should construct a
waiting room outside your shop.

242
00:13:13,924 --> 00:13:15,719
What's the matter, sir?
Why are you annoyed?

243
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:18,362
I am not annoyed. Hurry up. Move it.

244
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,216
Your job is being done. I assure you.

245
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,134
Tell me something.
Shall I give you Baba brand flour?

246
00:13:23,814 --> 00:13:25,049
I am only serving the country.

247
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:27,341
Give me any Baba's flour. Hurry up.

248
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:29,632
Give me Baba brand flour.

249
00:13:32,998 --> 00:13:35,427
Brother, give me bread,
eggs and a bag of milk.

250
00:13:35,507 --> 00:13:36,966
Of course.

251
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:41,924
Your total comes up to 1470 rupees.

252
00:13:42,716 --> 00:13:44,632
Give the lady eggs as well.

253
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,561
Take it.

254
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,014
What's the matter?

255
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:04,507
What's the matter?
Did you forget something?

256
00:14:07,406 --> 00:14:09,466
You got everything you
need for lunch and dinner.

257
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:12,966
I think you've forgotten eggs.

258
00:14:14,798 --> 00:14:15,882
How much for the eggs?

259
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:17,238
Six for 40 rupees.

260
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:18,466
Give me six.

261
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,841
Chhotu, give the man six eggs.

262
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:23,091
Give me another ten rupees.

263
00:14:30,175 --> 00:14:32,191
I don't have ten rupees right now.

264
00:14:32,549 --> 00:14:35,374
I shall give it to you when
I pass here. Put it on my tab. Okay?

265
00:14:35,454 --> 00:14:36,132
Oh!

266
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:38,924
- What?
- Let him go, brother.

267
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:40,403
He is aunt Sodhi's guest.

268
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:41,882
I see.

269
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:43,882
You are Mrs. Sodhi's guest?

270
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:47,882
Excuse me. Excuse me!

271
00:14:48,774 --> 00:14:50,757
Does my money have thorns?

272
00:14:51,147 --> 00:14:54,902
You bought the eggs because you
did not want to touch my money, right?

273
00:14:54,982 --> 00:14:56,927
Don't you understand
that I am avoiding you?

274
00:14:57,007 --> 00:14:59,174
But I am not avoiding you.

275
00:14:59,257 --> 00:15:00,257
Listen to me.

276
00:15:00,578 --> 00:15:02,454
I don't speak to women like you.

277
00:15:02,632 --> 00:15:03,882
What do you mean by women like me?

278
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:05,966
What have I done?

279
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:08,216
Listen. Listen.
Listen. Listen. Listen.

280
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:11,878
Listen. Your network is very strong.

281
00:15:12,341 --> 00:15:14,382
You downloaded all the
information about this lane..

282
00:15:14,716 --> 00:15:16,424
..faster than 4G speed
as soon as you arrived.

283
00:15:16,924 --> 00:15:18,341
Not bad!

284
00:15:19,132 --> 00:15:20,882
Listen! Hey!

285
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:40,007
How could you bring eggs to my house?

286
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:42,257
If your uncle had been alive today..

287
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,632
..I would have to get
the whole house whitewashed.

288
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:54,591
Sometimes I feel very
jealous of that Bengali woman.

289
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:56,799
You know the boy who visits
her house these days?

290
00:15:56,882 --> 00:15:57,882
Shekhar.

291
00:15:57,966 --> 00:16:01,453
His name is Shekhar. I heard
his name when I eavesdropped on her.

292
00:16:01,716 --> 00:16:03,674
He is very hot!

293
00:16:04,716 --> 00:16:06,174
He has six pack abs.

294
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,427
I feel like calling him
home someday to count them..

295
00:16:09,507 --> 00:16:11,469
..and find out if he has six or nine.

296
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:13,966
So, count them and find
out if he has six or nine.

297
00:16:15,468 --> 00:16:18,844
I have noticed you
have your heart set on him.

298
00:16:18,924 --> 00:16:22,591
You do. She was ogling at him.

299
00:16:22,674 --> 00:16:24,049
No, no, aunty.

300
00:16:24,257 --> 00:16:26,216
We were wondering why he visits her..

301
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:28,591
..when he has a wife at home.

302
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:31,268
How can people do that?

303
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:34,382
Yesterday I saw a TV being
delivered to the Bengali woman's home.

304
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,341
- Yesterday afternoon, right?
- Yes.

305
00:16:36,674 --> 00:16:40,148
That's right.
I saw it too. It is a 50 inch TV.

306
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:43,204
Everything happens in
the afternoons in Delhi..

307
00:16:44,132 --> 00:16:46,716
..when everyone else is asleep.

308
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,632
That is true.

309
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:51,591
Of course. I am the bad one.

310
00:16:51,674 --> 00:16:56,604
You come home drunk
and start thrashing me.

311
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,340
Is that.. Aah! Mummy!

312
00:16:59,676 --> 00:17:02,636
I will complain to my mummy.

313
00:17:02,716 --> 00:17:04,632
Great! He is at it again.

314
00:17:04,716 --> 00:17:07,124
Saturday night. And it's live action.

315
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,511
Help me!

316
00:17:08,591 --> 00:17:10,876
This is a daily event with them.

317
00:17:11,466 --> 00:17:12,844
What's going on, aunt?

318
00:17:13,007 --> 00:17:15,302
Nothing. Nothing.
He does this all the time.

319
00:17:15,382 --> 00:17:16,628
Live action.

320
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:20,132
I am doomed.

321
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:22,180
Beasts live there.

322
00:17:42,052 --> 00:17:43,372
Aunty.

323
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,424
Please.

324
00:17:57,551 --> 00:17:59,463
Get back, man! It's over.

325
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,729
Come on Friday.

326
00:18:56,952 --> 00:18:59,271
How many years have
you been building your body?

327
00:18:59,704 --> 00:19:03,771
I asked because you
haven't succeeded as yet.

328
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:08,191
What do you want?
Why are you hounding me?

329
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:10,229
I've fallen for you.

330
00:19:11,164 --> 00:19:13,352
I'm kidding. Don't take it seriously.

331
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:20,063
I said it because you
believe everything you hear.

332
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:24,438
Will you have tea?

333
00:19:26,092 --> 00:19:27,479
Look, Bengali woman.

334
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:29,792
First you said hi and
now you're offering me tea.

335
00:19:29,938 --> 00:19:31,729
Don't mistake me for an idiot.

336
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:33,604
I don't think you're an idiot.

337
00:19:33,854 --> 00:19:35,940
I think you are a lion.

338
00:19:36,136 --> 00:19:40,354
I liked the heroic entry you made
last night to rescue Mrs. Khurana.

339
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:45,813
There are very few
real men in this lane.

340
00:19:52,572 --> 00:19:55,505
Are you really working out
or are you showing off your body?

341
00:20:02,195 --> 00:20:03,869
Don't you have anything else to do?
Go inside!

342
00:20:05,686 --> 00:20:08,218
They have turned
this into a mental zone.

343
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:11,688
Do you work?

344
00:20:14,354 --> 00:20:15,521
You don't?

345
00:20:16,188 --> 00:20:18,271
You take money from
your aunt for the eggs?

346
00:20:22,534 --> 00:20:24,146
Take my advice.

347
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,063
Go to Jantar Mantar.

348
00:20:26,396 --> 00:20:27,646
What is Jantar Mantar?

349
00:20:28,021 --> 00:20:30,233
All the idlers in
Delhi convene over there.

350
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,813
They shout slogans.
You shout them too.

351
00:20:33,396 --> 00:20:35,521
You will get sufficient
money for tea and puffs.

352
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,604
Pandey.

353
00:20:57,962 --> 00:20:59,271
Pandey.

354
00:21:03,831 --> 00:21:07,483
Oh! So this is where
you tarnish your face?

355
00:21:08,271 --> 00:21:13,050
I was wondering how come I
didn't spot you for the past 5-6 days.

356
00:21:14,771 --> 00:21:17,563
People with tarnished
faces are talking about others.

357
00:21:17,935 --> 00:21:19,188
What? What did you say?

358
00:21:20,271 --> 00:21:21,396
Nayan.

359
00:21:23,021 --> 00:21:24,896
Come on in.
You have come at the perfect time.

360
00:21:24,976 --> 00:21:25,896
Yes, Pandey.

361
00:21:26,354 --> 00:21:27,438
Come. Have lunch.

362
00:21:28,726 --> 00:21:29,826
- Sit here.
- Pandey,

363
00:21:29,979 --> 00:21:31,316
I brought your shirt.

364
00:21:31,396 --> 00:21:33,021
Is that so? Wonderful!

365
00:21:33,403 --> 00:21:35,188
- What do you think?
- It is lovely.

366
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:36,813
Very good! Sit. Sit.

367
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,313
Give the bag to me. Sit.

368
00:21:38,393 --> 00:21:40,938
Yes. Let's have lunch.

369
00:21:42,513 --> 00:21:44,861
"Colorful."

370
00:21:45,155 --> 00:21:47,643
"Pandey is colorful."

371
00:21:49,186 --> 00:21:50,229
Rano!

372
00:21:50,854 --> 00:21:52,313
Hasn't your lunch been delivered?

373
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:53,979
Come and have lunch with us.

374
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,834
Stuffed flatbread, yogurt and pickle.
I have it all.

375
00:21:57,188 --> 00:21:58,325
No.

376
00:21:58,771 --> 00:22:00,774
- You go ahead.
- Come. Eat a little.

377
00:22:00,854 --> 00:22:03,176
I told you I am not hungry. You eat.

378
00:22:03,975 --> 00:22:06,816
In any case I don't want
to stray my religious path.

379
00:22:07,563 --> 00:22:09,271
Your lunch.

380
00:22:10,105 --> 00:22:12,440
Oh! Aunt Sodhi was
going to come here herself.

381
00:22:12,604 --> 00:22:15,301
I told her she should
allow youngsters to help her.

382
00:22:16,104 --> 00:22:17,646
Please come.

383
00:22:24,729 --> 00:22:25,813
Come.

384
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:46,021
You want to feed me now?

385
00:22:46,553 --> 00:22:47,743
Shall I?

386
00:22:48,082 --> 00:22:49,896
No! Go away!

387
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:56,561
- Pandey, I'll leave now.
- Stay.

388
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,311
Hey! What's the matter?
You find it funny?

389
00:23:01,391 --> 00:23:03,188
Eat your food or I will slap you.

390
00:23:17,342 --> 00:23:20,294
Mr. Randeep, you make a lovely couple.

391
00:23:20,521 --> 00:23:22,662
Shall I get the wedding cards printed?

392
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:24,771
I know a printer.

393
00:23:26,354 --> 00:23:27,688
Listen to him.

394
00:23:28,454 --> 00:23:30,606
You sit to eat with tramps..

395
00:23:31,081 --> 00:23:32,438
..and you want to
get my cards printed?

396
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,313
Hey, hero.

397
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,646
Let me make this clear to you.

398
00:23:37,086 --> 00:23:39,510
Good-humored banter is fine.
I don't get offended.

399
00:23:39,729 --> 00:23:43,758
Hereafter if you bring
up Nayan even by mistake..

400
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:45,396
..you will be sorry.

401
00:23:47,063 --> 00:23:48,438
Get back to work.

402
00:24:01,854 --> 00:24:03,313
Hey!

403
00:24:03,396 --> 00:24:04,563
Wiseguy!

404
00:24:04,646 --> 00:24:05,854
- What?
- Take this.

405
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:07,414
I want the car back in the evening.

406
00:24:08,062 --> 00:24:09,190
It's like this, brother.
This is a car..

407
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,729
..not a horse that I can
feed water and return to you.

408
00:24:10,813 --> 00:24:12,425
It is a car.
It will take a day or two.

409
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:14,688
Really? I'll talk to Pandey.

410
00:24:15,313 --> 00:24:17,768
Talk to the Prime Minister.
Why are you trying to intimidate me?

411
00:24:18,188 --> 00:24:21,813
He wants to talk to Pandey.
I will thrash the bloody hippopotamus.

412
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:42,521
Auto!

413
00:24:46,981 --> 00:24:50,450
God! Please save me today.

414
00:24:58,109 --> 00:25:01,816
Hey! What is it?
- You? Thank God!

415
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:03,104
What is the matter?

416
00:25:03,693 --> 00:25:06,229
- Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
- Tell me what happened.

417
00:25:06,313 --> 00:25:07,123
Let's go.

418
00:25:07,203 --> 00:25:08,271
Where do you want to go?
To the hospital?

419
00:25:08,351 --> 00:25:09,441
Just drive the car.

420
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:12,464
I'll drive the car but first
tell me what's happened.

421
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:14,188
Move!

422
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:17,782
O, God! Please.
Please. Please. Please.

423
00:25:18,021 --> 00:25:19,979
Get lost, you scumbag!

424
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,896
Will you tell me what happened?
Shall I call the Doctor?

425
00:25:28,938 --> 00:25:30,354
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

426
00:25:30,813 --> 00:25:32,354
- Where? Where?
- Stop!

427
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:34,521
Stop the car!

428
00:25:35,446 --> 00:25:37,641
Stop! Stop!

429
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,834
What's the matter? Will you talk?

430
00:25:41,146 --> 00:25:43,924
Hello? Where are you going?

431
00:25:44,646 --> 00:25:46,021
Hello?

432
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:55,530
God! Just a little further.

433
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:57,646
Hello?

434
00:25:58,868 --> 00:26:01,660
Tell me if I should stay or leave.

435
00:26:03,203 --> 00:26:04,813
Strange female.

436
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:22,565
What?

437
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:29,104
Are you crazy? You were screaming
a minute ago and now you're smiling.

438
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:30,108
What is going on?

439
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:33,500
Sorry. I needed to go urgently. Pee.

440
00:26:33,756 --> 00:26:36,816
You wanted to pee? That's
why you created such a big scene?

441
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:39,187
I thought you were going to go up.

442
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:40,813
It wasn't time for me to go up.

443
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:42,354
It was time for me to go from down.

444
00:26:42,896 --> 00:26:46,231
It feels exactly the same
when a woman is pregnant, my boy.

445
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,458
Sure. Pregnant woman!

446
00:26:49,104 --> 00:26:51,409
Hello. Why are you getting
into the car, ma'am?

447
00:26:51,489 --> 00:26:52,729
Drop me off home.

448
00:26:54,563 --> 00:26:56,483
You're a very selfish woman!

449
00:26:56,563 --> 00:26:57,729
Yes, I am.

450
00:27:08,646 --> 00:27:12,229
Hey! Why are you always so grouchy?

451
00:27:15,895 --> 00:27:19,143
You did a good deed. You helped me.

452
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:24,771
Okay. Then I'm sure you must be.
Be happy. A little bit.

453
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,729
Smile.

454
00:27:31,896 --> 00:27:32,979
Smile.

455
00:27:53,771 --> 00:27:55,104
See you. Bye.

456
00:27:58,063 --> 00:28:00,373
- Go now.
- It won't open.

457
00:28:18,605 --> 00:28:19,896
Thank you.

458
00:28:23,021 --> 00:28:25,188
I shall send it to Mrs. Sodhi now.

459
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,646
- Hi, Shekhar.
- Hi.

460
00:28:32,726 --> 00:28:34,274
- When did you come?
- It's been ten minutes.

461
00:28:34,354 --> 00:28:35,271
Give it to me.

462
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:38,238
- Is this heavy?
- No. No. How are you?

463
00:28:38,438 --> 00:28:40,221
- Have you eaten?
- Yes. Yes.

464
00:28:41,514 --> 00:28:43,248
Who was that?

465
00:28:58,179 --> 00:28:59,979
Bring me a cup of tea.

466
00:29:06,473 --> 00:29:08,229
Did they put salt in this?

467
00:29:12,229 --> 00:29:14,688
No. It's just fine.

468
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:16,604
Oh, well. I shall drink it.

469
00:29:16,938 --> 00:29:18,646
You ordered one more, didn't you?

470
00:29:19,688 --> 00:29:22,313
- Nayan, you're here.
- Mr. Pandey.

471
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:23,729
- Where's the car?
- Over there.

472
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:25,229
I see. This car.

473
00:29:25,438 --> 00:29:28,013
Mr. Rano, go and check the car.

474
00:29:28,188 --> 00:29:31,646
Madam is purchasing a new car and
if we make a mistake in assessing it..

475
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:32,847
..it will be a shame on us.

476
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,063
Go.

477
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,313
Come.

478
00:29:38,976 --> 00:29:40,637
I won't do it.
Get someone else to assess it.

479
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:43,104
Why? Have you applied
henna on your hands?

480
00:29:43,854 --> 00:29:47,771
I don't want to touch this car
that you've bought with dirty money.

481
00:29:51,438 --> 00:29:54,703
This is not dirty money.
It is the baby's father's earning.

482
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:59,470
What's the matter?
Go and take a look at it.

483
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,646
Go. This is too much!

484
00:30:34,438 --> 00:30:36,271
Do you know who the baby's father is?

485
00:30:37,229 --> 00:30:39,771
I don't know and I am
not interested in knowing.

486
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:42,713
Exactly! Neither am I interested..

487
00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:47,261
..but need makes you
do all kinds of things.

488
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:52,771
Come on. Do your work.

489
00:31:43,437 --> 00:31:45,893
You? Your house is across the road.

490
00:31:46,061 --> 00:31:47,896
I want to tell you something.

491
00:31:48,149 --> 00:31:50,207
You aren't proposing me, are you?

492
00:31:52,696 --> 00:31:54,438
Can we go inside to talk?

493
00:31:54,795 --> 00:31:58,188
Look, if you're trying
to save your image..

494
00:31:58,487 --> 00:31:59,684
..hen we're fine here.

495
00:31:59,979 --> 00:32:02,660
It's just that we are
doing what we are doing here..

496
00:32:03,036 --> 00:32:04,813
but if you come inside..

497
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:08,599
..then our clothes will
come off in public imagination.

498
00:32:14,172 --> 00:32:17,271
Okay. I just wanted to tell you

499
00:32:17,556 --> 00:32:22,215
..that you can bargain for another
30-35 thousand rupees on that car.

500
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,188
So..

501
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:25,521
Okay.

502
00:32:25,604 --> 00:32:26,688
I'm going.

503
00:32:27,188 --> 00:32:30,479
Listen. Don't buy the car.

504
00:32:30,813 --> 00:32:32,604
It is not a good car. You will have
to spend a lot on it.

505
00:32:32,688 --> 00:32:33,563
Find another one.

506
00:32:34,896 --> 00:32:36,729
Where do I go looking
for one in my condition?

507
00:32:38,313 --> 00:32:39,313
Okay.

508
00:32:39,396 --> 00:32:40,813
I shall find one for you.

509
00:32:42,064 --> 00:32:43,188
You will find one?

510
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,938
- Yes.
- Really?

511
00:32:46,896 --> 00:32:48,604
You will find one?

512
00:32:49,685 --> 00:32:51,813
- Thank you.
- Goodnight.

513
00:33:04,755 --> 00:33:05,646
What?

514
00:33:06,313 --> 00:33:07,813
Why did you go over there?

515
00:33:08,561 --> 00:33:10,917
What is going on between you two?

516
00:33:11,064 --> 00:33:12,063
Look.

517
00:33:12,771 --> 00:33:14,154
I warned you.

518
00:33:14,354 --> 00:33:16,896
I told you to stay away from her.
She is a witch.

519
00:33:17,092 --> 00:33:18,854
- Aunt, listen to me.
- Silence!

520
00:33:19,438 --> 00:33:20,938
Hold on. Look at this.

521
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:23,899
Look at what Shipra sent me.

522
00:33:23,979 --> 00:33:25,104
What?

523
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:27,358
It's a boomerang.

524
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:29,563
Silence! Both of you
were in the car together.

525
00:33:31,771 --> 00:33:34,313
What will I tell my brother?

526
00:33:34,938 --> 00:33:36,313
What's the matter with you?

527
00:33:36,604 --> 00:33:39,858
Aunt, why don't you
join a good news channel?

528
00:33:40,146 --> 00:33:42,313
- Don't talk nonsense!
- I'm not talking nonsense.

529
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:45,733
They need this kind of melodrama.

530
00:33:45,813 --> 00:33:49,354
If you behave this way over
there their TRPs will rise sky-high.

531
00:33:50,146 --> 00:33:51,646
I'll show you TRP.

532
00:33:52,438 --> 00:33:54,021
You are talking nonsense!

533
00:33:54,893 --> 00:33:55,732
Listen.

534
00:33:58,175 --> 00:33:59,208
Stop!

535
00:34:01,935 --> 00:34:03,854
God!

536
00:34:13,772 --> 00:34:15,188
You are sitting here?

537
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,359
Forget it.

538
00:34:24,169 --> 00:34:27,983
Look. I brought you chamomile tea.

539
00:34:28,063 --> 00:34:29,604
Come. Come. Come.

540
00:34:30,146 --> 00:34:33,063
It will cool your head.

541
00:34:36,604 --> 00:34:37,688
Hey!

542
00:34:38,049 --> 00:34:39,801
Hey!
Hey!

543
00:34:41,097 --> 00:34:42,021
Stop.

544
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:21,712
You should thank the
person who brought you here.

545
00:35:22,063 --> 00:35:23,063
Who?

546
00:35:27,093 --> 00:35:28,396
Hey!

547
00:35:31,923 --> 00:35:33,146
It's you.

548
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:38,563
Of course, it is me.
Who else could I be?

549
00:35:38,923 --> 00:35:40,479
You were the only
one in such a big lane..

550
00:35:40,563 --> 00:35:42,313
..with the guts to
bring me to the hospital.

551
00:35:43,229 --> 00:35:46,498
I think there is something between us.

552
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:48,771
What?

553
00:35:50,313 --> 00:35:51,646
Connection.

554
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:55,084
If not from this lifetime
then surely from our past lives.

555
00:35:57,646 --> 00:36:01,005
I don't know about that.
Give me the number.

556
00:36:01,521 --> 00:36:02,563
Whose?

557
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,229
Your..

558
00:36:07,558 --> 00:36:10,438
Your boyfriend's.
It is night. I have to go home.

559
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:14,191
Which boyfriend? I have many.

560
00:36:14,271 --> 00:36:16,399
Weekend boyfriend. Weekly boyfriend.

561
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:18,933
Incidentally I have seasonal ones too.

562
00:36:19,188 --> 00:36:22,048
One for the summer. One for
the winter. Another one for autumn.

563
00:36:23,117 --> 00:36:24,479
Have you no shame?

564
00:36:25,229 --> 00:36:26,813
Why would I feel shame?

565
00:36:27,063 --> 00:36:30,021
I am only repeating the
words of the people in the colony.

566
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,063
That is what you believe, right?

567
00:36:36,514 --> 00:36:38,613
I don't believe anything.
Just give me the number.

568
00:36:38,854 --> 00:36:39,896
Whose?

569
00:36:40,737 --> 00:36:43,188
Whose? Obviously, your boyfriend's.

570
00:36:43,854 --> 00:36:45,191
You mean the baby's father?

571
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:47,070
Again you are going round the..

572
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,938
You are going round the bush again.

573
00:36:49,018 --> 00:36:52,224
The baby's father and your boyfriend
must be the same person, won't he?

574
00:36:53,101 --> 00:36:54,894
The baby's father is not my boyfriend.

575
00:36:55,771 --> 00:36:57,733
Do you think I am in idiot?

576
00:36:58,188 --> 00:37:00,271
I don't think it. You are.

577
00:37:01,389 --> 00:37:04,216
I make babies. For others.

578
00:37:05,752 --> 00:37:07,146
I am a surrogate mother.

579
00:37:09,292 --> 00:37:11,551
Let it go. You won't understand.

580
00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:15,729
What do you mean, I won't understand?
I know what that is.

581
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:16,887
- You know?
- Yes.

582
00:37:17,136 --> 00:37:18,479
Tell me what surrogacy is.

583
00:37:18,563 --> 00:37:20,010
You want me to tell you?

584
00:37:20,146 --> 00:37:20,938
Yes.

585
00:37:23,202 --> 00:37:26,469
- Look, It's like this. You take a bowl.
- Yes.

586
00:37:26,549 --> 00:37:29,021
First they place a
woman's eggs in it. Okay?

587
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,900
Then they place a man's
eggs in the same bowl.

588
00:37:32,313 --> 00:37:33,354
Hold on.

589
00:37:33,864 --> 00:37:35,636
- A man's eggs?
- Yes.

590
00:37:37,383 --> 00:37:39,313
Have you seen a man's eggs?

591
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,813
Everyone has eggs.

592
00:37:42,938 --> 00:37:44,979
Doc, have you seen a man's eggs?

593
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:46,604
What?

594
00:37:46,853 --> 00:37:49,567
Don't laugh. I have seen a man's eggs.

595
00:37:50,188 --> 00:37:53,563
A few days ago a man came
to the general store in our lane..

596
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:55,729
..to purchase a man's eggs.

597
00:37:55,813 --> 00:37:56,563
Really?

598
00:37:57,771 --> 00:37:58,979
Rano.

599
00:38:00,229 --> 00:38:03,921
Rano. When will you
come out of the egg?

600
00:38:04,063 --> 00:38:06,688
Very funny!
Very good joke. You are laughing too.

601
00:38:07,146 --> 00:38:09,063
So, you're staying
tonight with the patient?

602
00:38:09,313 --> 00:38:10,438
Yes. Of course.

603
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:16,015
Okay. Goodnight. Take care. Bye.

604
00:38:16,521 --> 00:38:17,854
You're crazy.

605
00:38:24,354 --> 00:38:26,816
Well, I'll call aunt
since I'm going to be here.

606
00:38:26,896 --> 00:38:27,604
Yes.

607
00:39:07,196 --> 00:39:08,813
Good morning.

608
00:39:12,945 --> 00:39:14,021
You want tea?

609
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,604
I'll get some from out.

610
00:39:18,896 --> 00:39:21,896
The hospital tea reeks of phenyl.

611
00:39:23,271 --> 00:39:24,813
Find out about my discharge too.

612
00:39:25,146 --> 00:39:26,896
I have many deliveries today.

613
00:39:28,774 --> 00:39:30,019
What? Children?

614
00:39:30,188 --> 00:39:32,507
No, you silly. Clothes.

615
00:39:33,021 --> 00:39:34,186
I am a tailor.

616
00:39:34,266 --> 00:39:36,697
I recreate first copies
of celebrity designers.

617
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:38,271
I sell clothes worth hundreds
of thousands of rupees..

618
00:39:38,354 --> 00:39:39,604
..to the customers for thousands.

619
00:39:40,021 --> 00:39:41,771
They are happy and I am happy too.

620
00:39:43,903 --> 00:39:45,104
I see.

621
00:39:45,688 --> 00:39:46,479
What?

622
00:39:46,831 --> 00:39:50,188
I see. That means the people
who come to your house.. I see.

623
00:39:50,476 --> 00:39:52,313
Okay. That makes sense.

624
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:54,854
Listen. Will you make me an LV jacket?

625
00:39:55,931 --> 00:39:58,789
Yes, I will. Go and find
out about my discharge first.

626
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:18,563
- I want to ask you something.
- Yes.

627
00:40:21,688 --> 00:40:25,013
My mind divided in two parts.

628
00:40:25,093 --> 00:40:30,688
One part tells me to ask you and the
other part says it is inappropriate.

629
00:40:31,347 --> 00:40:34,191
I mean I am a little confused.

630
00:40:34,271 --> 00:40:36,438
Are you related to a pretzel?

631
00:40:36,966 --> 00:40:38,896
- Who?
- No. Not pretzel.

632
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:40,774
My aunt's name is Cookie.

633
00:40:40,854 --> 00:40:42,313
We call her Cookie at home.

634
00:40:42,688 --> 00:40:44,604
Just come out with it.

635
00:40:45,479 --> 00:40:46,729
Okay.

636
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:52,150
I was saying this type of babies..
- What type?

637
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:57,364
I mean surrogate babies.
It is good. I'm not saying it is bad.

638
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:02,862
I was wondering who
the babies look like.

639
00:41:04,117 --> 00:41:07,931
I mean there must be several
babies that look like you in Delhi, right?

640
00:41:08,146 --> 00:41:10,313
Yes. There are. Look there!

641
00:41:10,813 --> 00:41:12,824
The one in red. She is my daughter.

642
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:14,438
Let's go say hello to her.

643
00:41:14,518 --> 00:41:16,399
Stop the car.
Stop the car. Let's go and say hello.

644
00:41:16,479 --> 00:41:17,658
- Her? Now?
- Yes.

645
00:41:17,738 --> 00:41:18,771
You recognize them at sight?

646
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:22,354
Rano!

647
00:41:22,618 --> 00:41:24,396
Damn! You..

648
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,688
You confused me.

649
00:41:37,091 --> 00:41:43,060
"Nights spent wide awake and sleepy days."

650
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:51,163
"Moments lost in untold words."

651
00:41:52,994 --> 00:41:56,411
"What kind of light is this?"

652
00:41:56,907 --> 00:42:00,731
"This light is kind of unfamiliar."

653
00:42:01,076 --> 00:42:04,499
"It is your advent that has brought..

654
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:08,118
..this unfamiliar light."

655
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:14,827
"Your arrival is the reason."

656
00:42:15,379 --> 00:42:21,277
"I smile without reason these days."

657
00:42:27,288 --> 00:42:33,950
"It is the impact of your arrival.."

658
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:38,178
"..these days."

659
00:42:38,258 --> 00:42:40,130
Look at this one.

660
00:42:41,009 --> 00:42:43,001
I don't like the color.

661
00:42:43,585 --> 00:42:45,938
You're supposed to look at
the engine in the car, not the color.

662
00:42:46,018 --> 00:42:48,217
- No.
- It looks fine to me.

663
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:52,473
But the seat is not very comfortable.

664
00:42:53,056 --> 00:42:54,809
The seat is not comfortable.

665
00:42:54,889 --> 00:42:56,264
You are a tailor. Stitch one.

666
00:42:56,348 --> 00:42:57,926
I need comfort too.

667
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:05,226
No, no, no.
The gold silk chap won't come either..

668
00:43:05,306 --> 00:43:07,251
..so it won't get done.
Yes, alright.

669
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:09,806
Yes. No, aunty.
You will get it by day after tomorrow.

670
00:43:10,284 --> 00:43:12,082
The gold silk chap isn't coming.

671
00:43:12,162 --> 00:43:14,306
It has gold silk work on it.

672
00:43:14,389 --> 00:43:16,598
Ask Sonu. No problem.

673
00:43:16,681 --> 00:43:17,723
Yes.

674
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,304
Yes, yes. Alright.
It will be done by day after tomorrow.

675
00:43:27,296 --> 00:43:31,002
"Without asking and unknowingly.."

676
00:43:31,082 --> 00:43:34,097
"..you put your head on my shoulder."
- Sonu!

677
00:43:34,177 --> 00:43:36,036
Here's your delivery.

678
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:42,397
"- I'll bring tea for you."
- No.

679
00:43:43,242 --> 00:43:48,252
"You are around me all the time and yet.."

680
00:43:48,332 --> 00:43:52,330
"..I am searching."

681
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:58,866
"Why have I gotten so used to you?"

682
00:44:00,451 --> 00:44:07,433
"Was it the sound of
feet or is it a knock?"

683
00:44:07,513 --> 00:44:15,489
"Shall I keep my eyes open
or shall I keep them closed?"

684
00:44:16,971 --> 00:44:20,595
"What kind of light is this?"

685
00:44:20,939 --> 00:44:24,875
"This light is kind of unfamiliar."

686
00:44:24,955 --> 00:44:31,723
"It is your advent that has
brought this unfamiliar light."

687
00:44:35,283 --> 00:44:39,195
"Your arrival is the reason.."

688
00:44:39,275 --> 00:44:45,755
"..I smile without reason these days."

689
00:44:51,258 --> 00:44:58,272
"It is the impact of your arrival..

690
00:44:58,352 --> 00:45:03,282
..these days."

691
00:45:28,973 --> 00:45:31,431
You have it. This is delicious.

692
00:45:31,577 --> 00:45:33,106
What is it you call it in Bengali?

693
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:35,189
Very good! Very good!

694
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:36,856
This is my specialty.

695
00:45:38,634 --> 00:45:40,398
I don't normally eat fish.

696
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:44,773
Today it is so delicious.
That was enjoyable. Wow!

697
00:45:45,849 --> 00:45:47,064
Why are you chasing him?

698
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,359
Bengali! He is still a kid.

699
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:51,314
What are you saying, aunt?
She hasn't done anything.

700
00:45:51,394 --> 00:45:52,223
And I am not a kid.

701
00:45:52,303 --> 00:45:54,151
You be quiet. Don't talk at all!

702
00:45:54,231 --> 00:45:56,634
A person isn't grown up if
he eats this rotten fish. Get it?

703
00:45:56,813 --> 00:45:58,609
Aunt, we are only friends.

704
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,609
Don't you dare call me aunt!

705
00:46:00,689 --> 00:46:02,148
- Tell her!
- Don't call her aunt.

706
00:46:02,231 --> 00:46:03,523
Aunt, please stop it.

707
00:46:03,606 --> 00:46:04,807
The girl is not done anything.

708
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:07,679
Of course, she is not doing anything.
She has driven you crazy.

709
00:46:07,759 --> 00:46:10,103
She has shaken up your brains
feeding you this rotten fish.

710
00:46:10,183 --> 00:46:11,952
Aunt, I told you to be quiet.

711
00:46:13,066 --> 00:46:14,316
Okay.

712
00:46:14,649 --> 00:46:15,774
I'll be quiet hereafter.

713
00:46:16,024 --> 00:46:17,524
My brother will speak now..

714
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,034
..that is your father!

715
00:46:27,078 --> 00:46:30,191
Rano is getting out of control.

716
00:46:31,988 --> 00:46:33,816
Witch. Witch. Witch.

717
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:36,236
He is under the influence of a witch.

718
00:46:36,316 --> 00:46:37,608
And she is Bengali.

719
00:46:38,316 --> 00:46:38,941
What?

720
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:40,361
No. No. No. No. No.

721
00:46:40,441 --> 00:46:41,608
She is unmarried.

722
00:46:41,688 --> 00:46:43,483
- Let me talk to dad.
- But she has had children.

723
00:46:43,816 --> 00:46:46,024
Yes.
Yes.

724
00:46:46,108 --> 00:46:48,983
Lord knows where the first child is.
It is missing.

725
00:46:49,066 --> 00:46:50,403
You are talking to dad, aren't you?

726
00:46:50,483 --> 00:46:51,691
And the second child is on the way.

727
00:46:52,207 --> 00:46:56,066
Also, Rano has started eating eggs and

728
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:59,233
rotten fish too.

729
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:00,774
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

730
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,194
- What am I doing?
- Are you insane?

731
00:47:02,274 --> 00:47:03,944
- Yes, I am insane!
- You are educated, aren't you?

732
00:47:04,024 --> 00:47:04,483
Yes.

733
00:47:04,566 --> 00:47:05,566
It does not appear that way.

734
00:47:05,733 --> 00:47:07,399
You live in the Capital of India.

735
00:47:07,899 --> 00:47:09,561
You drink French press coffee..

736
00:47:09,733 --> 00:47:12,566
..but you still talk like
you are from the eighties.

737
00:47:13,274 --> 00:47:14,108
My..

738
00:47:14,316 --> 00:47:16,149
And, aunt,
she did not do anything. I..

739
00:47:16,816 --> 00:47:18,444
Don't talk nonsense about her.

740
00:47:18,524 --> 00:47:22,733
I will talk. This is my house!
I will do what I wish!

741
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:28,353
I shall decide who will have éclairs
and who will have baklava over here!

742
00:47:28,983 --> 00:47:32,777
I will talk to anyone
I want to over the phone.

743
00:47:32,857 --> 00:47:34,774
Okay. This is your house, right?

744
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:36,649
- Yes.
- This is your house, right?

745
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:38,278
- Yes.
- Okay. Alright.

746
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:40,856
You can have your
éclairs and your baklava.

747
00:47:41,774 --> 00:47:44,773
Hey! Hey, I'm not done yet.

748
00:47:45,067 --> 00:47:46,524
I am done.

749
00:47:55,816 --> 00:47:56,899
Okay.

750
00:47:56,983 --> 00:48:00,442
I came here for peace of mind..

751
00:48:00,816 --> 00:48:02,483
..but I can't find that for miles.

752
00:48:02,858 --> 00:48:04,647
And you are acting stuck-up
about this house, right?

753
00:48:04,858 --> 00:48:08,327
Well, you can keep this house.
I don't want to live in this house.

754
00:48:08,673 --> 00:48:10,983
Go if you want to. Go! Go! Go!

755
00:48:11,066 --> 00:48:13,361
You are thankless. You are thankless.

756
00:48:13,441 --> 00:48:17,233
All of you are thankless.
Nobody thinks about me.

757
00:48:19,899 --> 00:48:21,274
Wait!

758
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:26,149
Go. Go. Go.
You strut like a hero, don't you? Go.

759
00:48:26,874 --> 00:48:29,358
I'd like to see where you go.
I'd like to see.

760
00:48:40,687 --> 00:48:43,399
You are dead! You are dead to me!

761
00:48:45,441 --> 00:48:49,063
What? What is it?
You think this is a drama?

762
00:48:50,983 --> 00:48:52,441
You are dead to me!

763
00:49:09,524 --> 00:49:10,733
Put it here.

764
00:49:11,123 --> 00:49:13,233
You've turned this into mishmash.

765
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:29,441
May I ask you a question?

766
00:49:30,149 --> 00:49:32,316
As though you can hold yourself?

767
00:49:33,316 --> 00:49:35,503
My mind is divided in two parts.

768
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:39,358
One side tells me to ask while the
other side says what are you doing?

769
00:49:40,399 --> 00:49:42,358
Since when did you
start liking pretzels?

770
00:49:43,149 --> 00:49:45,899
When did I say I like pretzels?

771
00:49:46,396 --> 00:49:47,774
So ask me directly.

772
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:51,733
Why didn't you go to Ratna's house?
She's a hot gal.

773
00:49:52,233 --> 00:49:53,524
You think she's hot?

774
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:55,399
You go.

775
00:49:55,816 --> 00:49:57,444
Tell me. Why didn't you go?

776
00:49:57,524 --> 00:49:59,108
Okay.

777
00:49:59,691 --> 00:50:01,236
I'll go right now and
take my eclairs with me.

778
00:50:01,316 --> 00:50:03,056
Alright. Okay. Okay.Don't act cocky.

779
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:04,441
Eat your food.

780
00:50:05,774 --> 00:50:07,941
There's a room upstairs
and a vestibule.

781
00:50:08,691 --> 00:50:09,941
Where do you want to stay?

782
00:50:10,358 --> 00:50:12,399
Look. I am a village beast.

783
00:50:12,793 --> 00:50:14,108
- Okay?
- That you are.

784
00:50:14,188 --> 00:50:16,670
Yes. I like open air.

785
00:50:17,529 --> 00:50:18,858
I will go with the vestibule.

786
00:50:18,941 --> 00:50:19,941
Okay. Done.

787
00:50:20,073 --> 00:50:22,566
How much rent will I have to pay ?

788
00:50:23,024 --> 00:50:24,524
Bring me éclairs every day.

789
00:50:24,983 --> 00:50:26,316
- Every day?
- Every day.

790
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,683
Okay. Give me 50 rupees every
day and I'll bring you two éclairs.

791
00:50:41,524 --> 00:50:43,149
Yes, dad. Ask.

792
00:50:43,524 --> 00:50:44,608
Ask you what?

793
00:50:45,608 --> 00:50:47,986
Aunt's words must have filled
your mind with questions.

794
00:50:48,066 --> 00:50:49,316
Ask.

795
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:52,441
Storehouse of overconfidence
and over-smartness!

796
00:50:53,066 --> 00:50:54,483
Look up.

797
00:50:55,524 --> 00:50:58,169
look where, dad? How can I see you?

798
00:50:58,774 --> 00:51:00,316
Look in front of you!

799
00:51:03,274 --> 00:51:07,073
Why have you turned life
into a game of snakes and ladders?

800
00:51:07,316 --> 00:51:09,278
It must have been snakes
and ladders in your time.

801
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:10,861
In our times it is
called a roller-coaster.

802
00:51:10,941 --> 00:51:14,524
You are staying alone with
a girl in her house out of wedlock..

803
00:51:14,816 --> 00:51:17,361
..and you're explaining
the roller-coaster to your father?

804
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,108
I am living in, dad..

805
00:51:19,316 --> 00:51:20,858
..but you wouldn't understand.

806
00:51:20,941 --> 00:51:22,774
You have your head wrapped
around the Pajero at all times..

807
00:51:22,858 --> 00:51:24,319
..while the world has reached Mars.

808
00:51:24,399 --> 00:51:27,236
Hold on there. I shall carry
out a surgical strike and

809
00:51:27,316 --> 00:51:28,691
send you to Saturn.

810
00:51:28,983 --> 00:51:29,691
Come over here.

811
00:51:29,858 --> 00:51:31,191
- I want to talk to you.
- I see.

812
00:51:31,274 --> 00:51:33,069
You want me to walk there
for a beating from you.

813
00:51:33,149 --> 00:51:34,653
I won't come. This is my house now.

814
00:51:34,733 --> 00:51:36,944
If you want to talk to me,
you come here. You're most welcome.

815
00:51:37,024 --> 00:51:39,153
Hey! Don't you go presuming

816
00:51:39,233 --> 00:51:40,809
I will not come because of my ego!

817
00:51:41,145 --> 00:51:44,861
Come down. Prepare to welcome me.
I want to talk to you.

818
00:51:44,941 --> 00:51:46,233
Come on down.

819
00:51:46,816 --> 00:51:48,608
I tried to hit his ego but it didn't work.

820
00:51:51,961 --> 00:51:54,024
I will..!
- My first salary.

821
00:51:57,774 --> 00:52:00,849
Don't put your son or daughter
in my arms like this someday.

822
00:52:01,108 --> 00:52:02,108
Hold that.

823
00:52:02,358 --> 00:52:04,236
You are being so dramatic
the moment you got here.

824
00:52:04,316 --> 00:52:06,399
- Come inside. Let's talk inside.
- I won't go inside!

825
00:52:07,113 --> 00:52:10,611
You are a perfect example. A video
should be made of you for Youtube.

826
00:52:10,691 --> 00:52:12,649
- How to destroy one's own life.
- Really?

827
00:52:12,733 --> 00:52:14,191
And how did I destroy my life?

828
00:52:14,271 --> 00:52:15,733
No, no. It hasn't happened as yet..

829
00:52:15,816 --> 00:52:19,608
..but I can clearly see the
ditch on the path that you've taken.

830
00:52:20,233 --> 00:52:22,191
Don't you understand that this girl...

831
00:52:22,608 --> 00:52:23,653
Her name is Nayan.

832
00:52:23,733 --> 00:52:26,353
Whatever. Nayan or Kanan. Whatever.

833
00:52:27,024 --> 00:52:29,524
She is after you for
your estate and property.

834
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,903
You are rich. You have a good body.

835
00:52:31,983 --> 00:52:34,403
She couldn't find a better
candidate to plunder than you.

836
00:52:34,483 --> 00:52:36,566
Hold on, dad. Please pause for a bit.

837
00:52:36,649 --> 00:52:38,774
First explain the math
of estate and property.

838
00:52:39,233 --> 00:52:41,358
Grandpa had a small chunk of land,
which was divided into four parts..

839
00:52:41,441 --> 00:52:42,486
..because you were four brothers.

840
00:52:42,566 --> 00:52:43,986
You got one-fourth of it.

841
00:52:44,066 --> 00:52:45,316
Now that one-fourth part
will be divided into three parts..

842
00:52:45,399 --> 00:52:46,569
..as we are three brothers.

843
00:52:46,649 --> 00:52:47,399
Are you telling me..

844
00:52:47,483 --> 00:52:48,441
..a girl is being so manipulative..

845
00:52:48,524 --> 00:52:50,233
..for one-third of that
one-fourth part of land?

846
00:52:51,608 --> 00:52:53,024
Just think about it, dad.

847
00:52:53,108 --> 00:52:54,483
That girl has done you a favor..

848
00:52:54,566 --> 00:52:55,903
..by becoming friends with me.

849
00:52:55,983 --> 00:52:58,111
And it's thanks to
her I got my first salary.

850
00:52:58,191 --> 00:53:00,713
Why don't you continue staying here?

851
00:53:01,024 --> 00:53:03,532
I shall tell your mother
she has only two sons.

852
00:53:03,612 --> 00:53:04,236
Tell her.

853
00:53:04,316 --> 00:53:06,535
And the tiny chunk
of land that I have,

854
00:53:06,691 --> 00:53:08,236
it will be divided
into two parts only.

855
00:53:08,316 --> 00:53:09,066
- Okay.
- You continue living here.

856
00:53:09,149 --> 00:53:10,191
- - Yes, I will.
- So, stay here.

857
00:53:10,274 --> 00:53:11,233
- I don't care.
- I am staying here!

858
00:53:11,316 --> 00:53:15,566
Mother can't hear the things you say.
What will you tell her?

859
00:53:15,649 --> 00:53:17,358
- Forget it!
- Forget it."

860
00:53:17,566 --> 00:53:18,524
You go inside.

861
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:21,649
Aunty, it takes perception to copy.

862
00:53:22,191 --> 00:53:23,236
Yes.

863
00:53:23,316 --> 00:53:24,274
Excuse me.

864
00:53:25,106 --> 00:53:26,688
- This is it.
- Okay.

865
00:53:26,858 --> 00:53:28,358
I'll call you back, aunty.

866
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:31,316
Hello.

867
00:53:31,399 --> 00:53:32,441
Yes.

868
00:53:32,649 --> 00:53:33,691
Yes.

869
00:53:34,858 --> 00:53:36,233
Okay, I'll be there in one hour.

870
00:53:36,941 --> 00:53:37,983
Listen, Sonu.

871
00:53:38,066 --> 00:53:39,872
I have completed this. You
start on Mrs. Sharma's work.

872
00:53:39,952 --> 00:53:40,649
Okey.

873
00:53:40,733 --> 00:53:41,774
- You understand?
- Yes, yes.

874
00:53:41,858 --> 00:53:43,358
I am going to the hospital.

875
00:53:47,835 --> 00:53:49,491
Your boyfriend didn't accompany you?

876
00:53:49,571 --> 00:53:51,983
Boyfriend?

877
00:53:52,399 --> 00:53:53,814
No. I forbade him.

878
00:53:54,024 --> 00:53:55,319
He has a new job.

879
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:56,816
He must focus on his job, right?

880
00:53:56,899 --> 00:53:58,191
Absolutely.Go inside and take a seat.

881
00:53:58,274 --> 00:54:00,059
The Doctor will be
there in five minutes.

882
00:54:04,316 --> 00:54:05,358
Hi, Doc.

883
00:54:06,149 --> 00:54:07,441
How are you?

884
00:54:15,608 --> 00:54:17,108
Yes. Is everything okay?

885
00:54:18,858 --> 00:54:19,941
Nyonika.

886
00:54:20,652 --> 00:54:22,274
I won't beat around the bush.

887
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:25,024
There is a small complication.

888
00:54:25,691 --> 00:54:27,524
There is defect called ASD.

889
00:54:28,191 --> 00:54:29,566
Atrial Septal defect.

890
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:32,983
In layman terms,
there is a hole in the baby's heart.

891
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:42,046
I hope the baby's
life is not at risk.

892
00:54:42,483 --> 00:54:43,941
There are several factors.

893
00:54:44,524 --> 00:54:46,778
The baby's immunity.
Its strength to cope.

894
00:54:46,858 --> 00:54:49,524
Health after birth. It all depends.

895
00:54:49,983 --> 00:54:52,108
That means risk is involved.

896
00:54:55,858 --> 00:54:57,108
One more thing.

897
00:54:57,486 --> 00:54:59,941
I shared this
information with Shekhar.

898
00:55:00,899 --> 00:55:02,024
What did Shekhar say?

899
00:55:02,358 --> 00:55:05,203
Shekhar is unwilling to
accept this baby with the defect.

900
00:55:06,441 --> 00:55:08,306
What do you mean he is unwilling?

901
00:55:08,691 --> 00:55:11,066
He has signed this consent.

902
00:55:13,108 --> 00:55:14,691
But that's not your problem.

903
00:55:14,771 --> 00:55:16,108
It is the hospital's responsibility.

904
00:55:16,724 --> 00:55:18,404
will do something about it.

905
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,296
What's the matter, dad?
You want to apologize?

906
00:57:01,472 --> 00:57:03,768
Your landlady.

907
00:57:03,848 --> 00:57:05,453
Yes. Nayan. What about her?

908
00:57:05,697 --> 00:57:08,807
Something has happened.
Come home quickly.

909
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:25,691
What happened?

910
00:57:26,345 --> 00:57:27,611
What?

911
00:57:27,691 --> 00:57:28,566
Nothing.

912
00:57:29,191 --> 00:57:32,488
No. Dad called and said
you looked very perturbed.

913
00:57:32,568 --> 00:57:35,863
- What happened?
- No. Nothing happened.

914
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:41,359
Didn't you to the hospital today?
Did they say something?

915
00:57:41,634 --> 00:57:42,316
Yes

916
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:44,437
- What did they say?
- They said there's a complication.

917
00:57:44,706 --> 00:57:46,858
There's a hole in the baby's heart.

918
00:57:51,774 --> 00:57:53,358
What do you mean there's a hole?

919
00:57:54,316 --> 00:57:56,441
And Shekhar refused to take the baby.

920
00:57:57,049 --> 00:57:58,358
I shall bring the red one.

921
00:58:00,774 --> 00:58:03,899
How can he refuse?
Is he a man or a mouse?

922
00:58:05,535 --> 00:58:07,483
We have no reason to panic.

923
00:58:07,774 --> 00:58:09,796
The hospital will make
all the arrangements.

924
00:58:10,441 --> 00:58:13,233
If he doesn't take the baby
then someone else will adopt it.

925
00:58:17,774 --> 00:58:19,748
Listen. Are you okay?

926
00:58:20,149 --> 00:58:22,316
Yes. Why wouldn't I be okay?

927
00:58:23,796 --> 00:58:26,941
You should go.
You have work to do. Go.

928
00:58:30,564 --> 00:58:32,274
Will you eat tonight?

929
00:58:34,652 --> 00:58:36,191
Yes

930
00:58:47,316 --> 00:58:49,108
Mr. Randeep Singh.

931
00:58:49,691 --> 00:58:52,528
I have heard the National
drink of the Punjabis..

932
00:58:52,608 --> 00:58:55,673
..after 8 PM is this.

933
00:58:56,476 --> 00:58:57,524
Whiskey.

934
00:58:58,108 --> 00:59:00,691
Whereas you have immersed
yourself knee-deep in work.

935
00:59:01,816 --> 00:59:05,608
Come. Work will be
around all your life. Come.

936
00:59:22,274 --> 00:59:23,608
Are you jealous?

937
00:59:26,941 --> 00:59:28,774
Did you have a fight?

938
00:59:32,358 --> 00:59:35,778
Nayan kicked you out of the house?

939
00:59:35,858 --> 00:59:36,941
No.

940
00:59:39,149 --> 00:59:40,149
You need money?

941
00:59:40,233 --> 00:59:41,941
Don't you know, Pandey?

942
00:59:42,399 --> 00:59:43,566
Don't you know what has happened?

943
00:59:43,858 --> 00:59:45,441
You have been baiting me for so long.

944
01:00:02,983 --> 01:00:05,733
Sometimes a man becomes very helpless.

945
01:00:09,024 --> 01:00:12,066
He can't do anything
despite wanting to.

946
01:00:16,524 --> 01:00:18,441
I understand.

947
01:00:19,496 --> 01:00:21,441
You don't understand.

948
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,649
Not just you, nobody can understand.

949
01:00:25,733 --> 01:00:29,524
Only the sufferer can understand.

950
01:00:32,483 --> 01:00:35,441
You asked me if she kicked
me out of the house, didn't you?

951
01:00:35,691 --> 01:00:39,899
I wish she had. I wish she
had kicked me out of the house.

952
01:00:40,778 --> 01:00:43,108
I wish I needed money.

953
01:00:49,316 --> 01:00:51,983
Anything should have happened, Pandey.

954
01:00:58,316 --> 01:01:00,733
I just wish it wasn't this.

955
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:10,149
And I can't do a thing about it.

956
01:01:12,566 --> 01:01:14,858
I am available but
I cannot do anything.

957
01:01:16,149 --> 01:01:19,483
One doesn't always
have to do something.

958
01:01:21,154 --> 01:01:23,691
Just being there is what matters.

959
01:01:26,202 --> 01:01:29,024
And I am pleased..

960
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:37,566
..that you are standing
by her during this dark phase.

961
01:01:38,316 --> 01:01:40,316
That's why I am telling you.

962
01:01:40,594 --> 01:01:44,274
Don't immerse yourself in this work.

963
01:01:46,108 --> 01:01:47,566
Go home..

964
01:01:48,316 --> 01:01:53,691
..and help the firefly spread light.

965
01:01:56,358 --> 01:01:57,566
Go.

966
01:01:58,233 --> 01:01:59,441
Go home.

967
01:02:00,024 --> 01:02:04,816
And I am not going to
pay you overtime to stay late.

968
01:02:05,649 --> 01:02:06,899
Understand?

969
01:02:08,316 --> 01:02:09,774
Go home.

970
01:04:27,483 --> 01:04:29,108
Nayan.

971
01:04:31,566 --> 01:04:33,316
All will be well.

972
01:04:36,941 --> 01:04:38,774
Mr. Pandey said that you..

973
01:04:40,164 --> 01:04:41,649
like a firefly..

974
01:04:44,649 --> 01:04:46,816
..that spreads light everywhere.

975
01:04:50,816 --> 01:04:51,733
You have to

976
01:04:54,066 --> 01:04:57,516
spread light in this
baby's life in the same way.

977
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,941
I know you are very brave, my doll.

978
01:05:09,024 --> 01:05:11,191
You are even braver than me.

979
01:05:16,164 --> 01:05:17,983
Still if you ever..

980
01:05:20,012 --> 01:05:22,066
feel like crying..

981
01:05:23,668 --> 01:05:26,108
..then you should cry a little.

982
01:05:29,876 --> 01:05:31,316
But then..

983
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:37,524
..you wipe your tears and
turn into a firefly once again.

984
01:05:45,452 --> 01:05:47,274
Because this..

985
01:05:48,108 --> 01:05:49,649
junior over here..

986
01:05:52,233 --> 01:05:53,441
Silence.

987
01:05:56,024 --> 01:05:57,278
Silly chap.

988
01:05:57,358 --> 01:05:59,566
Your mummy is asleep.

989
01:06:00,733 --> 01:06:02,316
You are troubling her?

990
01:06:08,316 --> 01:06:10,274
Pleased come out quickly.

991
01:06:14,609 --> 01:06:16,524
You are my kickass baby, aren't you?

992
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:21,191
When you come out..

993
01:06:24,108 --> 01:06:26,668
we shall teach all of them a lesson.

994
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:32,274
The people here are very nasty.

995
01:06:35,649 --> 01:06:38,108
They have harassed your mummy.

996
01:06:42,644 --> 01:06:43,733
I..

997
01:06:48,692 --> 01:06:49,774
Never mind.

998
01:06:52,609 --> 01:06:53,858
Get some sleep now.

999
01:06:58,548 --> 01:07:00,066
We shall talk in the morning.

1000
01:07:03,524 --> 01:07:04,608
Okay?

1001
01:07:06,441 --> 01:07:07,649
God protect you.

1002
01:08:03,276 --> 01:08:06,233
Hey, Nayan. Something very
funny happened today. I tell you.

1003
01:08:06,316 --> 01:08:09,700
At the garage Pandey was
showing someone how to rig a car.

1004
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:12,941
Pandey very angrily told the chap,
"Move. I shall show you."

1005
01:08:13,149 --> 01:08:15,399
He went on to do it himself
and the car fell on him.

1006
01:08:16,897 --> 01:08:18,441
Everyone laughed.

1007
01:08:29,052 --> 01:08:30,278
What are you looking at?

1008
01:08:30,358 --> 01:08:31,441
Nothing.

1009
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,274
You want to go?
Even you want to go there?

1010
01:08:33,354 --> 01:08:34,149
No, sister. Why would..

1011
01:08:34,233 --> 01:08:35,358
This is how your son started..

1012
01:08:35,441 --> 01:08:37,551
..and he wound up there. The father
is going to follow in his footsteps.

1013
01:08:37,631 --> 01:08:38,691
- It's not that, sister.
- Silence.

1014
01:08:38,774 --> 01:08:39,816
Drink your tea.

1015
01:08:40,184 --> 01:08:42,341
- You're too much, sister! You..
- Inside. Go inside.

1016
01:08:42,858 --> 01:08:43,983
Hussy!

1017
01:08:44,681 --> 01:08:46,066
I shall prepare fish today.

1018
01:08:46,316 --> 01:08:47,759
Which fish do you Bengalis eat?

1019
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:49,111
Carp.

1020
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:50,816
Why should I carp?

1021
01:08:55,975 --> 01:08:57,441
I'll go and buy some.

1022
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:08,400
But he quoted a very high price.

1023
01:09:11,191 --> 01:09:12,691
One could learn to make
a deal from him.

1024
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:14,820
- It's a package deal.
- Exactly.

1025
01:09:15,274 --> 01:09:18,903
Without doing anything
he will have a baby in his arms.

1026
01:09:20,817 --> 01:09:23,037
He has a steady source of income too.

1027
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:28,451
What did you say?

1028
01:09:29,175 --> 01:09:32,736
What did you say? What did you say?
What did you say? What did you say?

1029
01:09:32,816 --> 01:09:34,149
What did you say?

1030
01:09:34,731 --> 01:09:38,028
Brother. Brother. Brother.
Sorry, brother. Sorry, brother.

1031
01:09:38,108 --> 01:09:41,611
Brother. Brother.
Brother. Brother. Brother. Brother.

1032
01:09:41,691 --> 01:09:42,983
Come out all of you!

1033
01:09:43,524 --> 01:09:46,858
Come out!
Come out, residents of this colony!

1034
01:09:48,104 --> 01:09:51,669
Shame on you!
You should be ashamed of yourselves!

1035
01:09:53,128 --> 01:09:56,299
You blow kisses. You make stories.

1036
01:09:57,191 --> 01:09:59,524
The dirt you have for Nayan.

1037
01:10:00,024 --> 01:10:01,524
It is the dirt in your mind.

1038
01:10:02,816 --> 01:10:05,608
You have a layer of
dirt in front of your eyes.

1039
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:09,191
That girl.

1040
01:10:09,608 --> 01:10:12,209
She wants to bring
happiness in someone's life.

1041
01:10:13,483 --> 01:10:16,358
She wants to give a
baby to a barren mother.

1042
01:10:17,187 --> 01:10:19,191
She wants to fulfill a father's wish.

1043
01:10:21,245 --> 01:10:23,653
Science has made
so much headway today..

1044
01:10:23,733 --> 01:10:25,610
it can make a baby
by in vitro fertilization.

1045
01:10:26,691 --> 01:10:28,983
They can take the man's
sperm and the woman's eggs..

1046
01:10:29,066 --> 01:10:30,608
but they still need a woman's womb!

1047
01:10:31,652 --> 01:10:34,024
This is the girl who
has provided her womb.

1048
01:10:35,425 --> 01:10:38,355
Have you people ever
given anyone a lollipop?

1049
01:10:39,024 --> 01:10:40,524
Don't make noise, Rano!

1050
01:10:40,941 --> 01:10:42,815
You only came here
recently. Get that?

1051
01:10:43,524 --> 01:10:45,765
You don't know all the facts as yet.

1052
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:50,646
That layer of dirt you were talking
about is in front of your eyes.

1053
01:10:50,983 --> 01:10:53,319
Do you know why our lane got
the reputation of being an infamous lane?

1054
01:10:53,399 --> 01:10:54,524
Because of her!

1055
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,069
And people ogle at our
daughters with vulgarity. Why?

1056
01:10:58,149 --> 01:10:59,757
- Shut up!
- Because of her.

1057
01:11:00,483 --> 01:11:02,191
She spread the rumors about herself?

1058
01:11:03,251 --> 01:11:05,066
She spread the rumors
about her own self?

1059
01:11:06,566 --> 01:11:10,442
All of you made up stories
without knowing the whole truth!

1060
01:11:11,524 --> 01:11:13,191
Never mind Nayan.

1061
01:11:14,276 --> 01:11:17,399
I know only too well what
your views about each other are.

1062
01:11:18,358 --> 01:11:20,270
How much you respect each other.

1063
01:11:22,233 --> 01:11:24,278
If you hear my aunt's
thoughts about you..

1064
01:11:24,358 --> 01:11:26,108
..you will fall off your roofs.

1065
01:11:28,441 --> 01:11:29,566
Him!

1066
01:11:30,149 --> 01:11:31,274
Mr. Khanna.

1067
01:11:31,649 --> 01:11:32,691
His son.

1068
01:11:33,983 --> 01:11:36,569
He cannot reveal the truth
about himself for fear of you all.

1069
01:11:36,649 --> 01:11:38,191
For you people will taunt him!

1070
01:11:39,149 --> 01:11:40,504
Are you crazy?

1071
01:11:41,066 --> 01:11:43,108
You are silent because
of these barbarians?

1072
01:11:45,035 --> 01:11:45,983
And him.

1073
01:11:46,858 --> 01:11:48,304
This scumbag Khurana.

1074
01:11:48,691 --> 01:11:50,066
You think you are very tough.

1075
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:51,566
You are tough?

1076
01:11:52,816 --> 01:11:54,858
You beat up a woman, scoundrel!

1077
01:12:00,553 --> 01:12:01,899
Evil people!

1078
01:12:04,355 --> 01:12:08,303
Because of you that baby has a hole
in the heart before even being born.

1079
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:13,191
You are such jinxes!

1080
01:12:15,483 --> 01:12:17,024
Your curse penetrated
the mother's stomach..

1081
01:12:17,108 --> 01:12:18,566
and made a hole in the baby's heart.

1082
01:12:22,774 --> 01:12:24,451
God, I pray you don't

1083
01:12:25,233 --> 01:12:30,774
let any child to be born in this lane.

1084
01:12:32,853 --> 01:12:35,566
Else these vultures will
rip it apart and eat it.

1085
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:41,733
Stop!

1086
01:15:54,204 --> 01:15:55,733
Sonu.

1087
01:15:57,324 --> 01:15:58,524
Sonu!

1088
01:15:59,036 --> 01:16:00,716
- Sonu.
- Yes, sister.

1089
01:16:00,981 --> 01:16:02,444
Vacate this room quickly.

1090
01:16:02,524 --> 01:16:04,819
Remove everything.
The fabric, the machine. Everything.

1091
01:16:04,899 --> 01:16:06,986
Have you received a new order, sister?
You didn't tell me.

1092
01:16:07,066 --> 01:16:07,941
Hello.

1093
01:16:08,024 --> 01:16:10,111
Ramji. You must come now.

1094
01:16:10,191 --> 01:16:12,149
It's important work. Come quickly.

1095
01:16:12,523 --> 01:16:13,608
Yes, alright.

1096
01:16:15,812 --> 01:16:19,066
Listen! Randeep Singh
will prepare food today.

1097
01:16:19,483 --> 01:16:20,524
Will you eat?

1098
01:16:20,983 --> 01:16:23,140
What's going on?

1099
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:26,691
Tell me something.
Has this become your hobby?

1100
01:16:26,774 --> 01:16:29,733
Sometimes you shift the things
from this room to that and vice-versa.

1101
01:16:30,028 --> 01:16:31,233
I am keeping the baby.

1102
01:16:31,316 --> 01:16:32,441
Keep the baby boy.

1103
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:35,483
I am keeping this baby.

1104
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:40,983
This baby?

1105
01:16:42,101 --> 01:16:43,486
What do you mean you're keeping it?

1106
01:16:43,566 --> 01:16:44,733
I am keeping it.

1107
01:16:45,024 --> 01:16:46,399
Are you insane?

1108
01:16:46,799 --> 01:16:48,649
Hey, I'm talking to you.

1109
01:16:50,733 --> 01:16:53,108
These decisions aren't
taken in a fit of emotion.

1110
01:16:53,856 --> 01:16:56,038
I think you haven't
thought it out carefully.

1111
01:16:57,817 --> 01:16:59,816
Shall I prepare tea?
Let's make ourselves comfortable..

1112
01:16:59,899 --> 01:17:01,566
..and talk about this calmly.

1113
01:17:01,646 --> 01:17:04,544
I have thought it out
calmly and at leisure..

1114
01:17:04,691 --> 01:17:06,345
..and my decision is final.

1115
01:17:06,425 --> 01:17:08,399
What final decision? Are you insane?

1116
01:17:08,941 --> 01:17:11,316
Do you know what a big responsibility
it is to raise a child?

1117
01:17:11,983 --> 01:17:14,367
And what have you planned? Tell me.

1118
01:17:14,524 --> 01:17:17,316
who will marry you in the
future if you have this child?

1119
01:17:17,483 --> 01:17:19,361
You have this business set up.
This work..

1120
01:17:19,441 --> 01:17:20,524
Have you given it any thought..

1121
01:17:20,608 --> 01:17:21,983
..or are you simply saying
that you've thought about it.

1122
01:17:22,066 --> 01:17:23,941
What are you saying, Rano?

1123
01:17:24,316 --> 01:17:26,691
I should abandon this
baby for a good future.

1124
01:17:27,316 --> 01:17:30,733
Did you think about how I would
look myself in the eye in future?

1125
01:17:31,358 --> 01:17:32,733
Oh, you!

1126
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:37,608
Nayan, listen to me. I understand.
I understand your emotional angle..

1127
01:17:37,691 --> 01:17:39,819
..but you don't understand.

1128
01:17:39,899 --> 01:17:42,730
Raising a child is
a huge responsibility.

1129
01:17:43,441 --> 01:17:45,441
Who would know that better than me?

1130
01:17:45,816 --> 01:17:48,191
I have faced the world all by myself.

1131
01:17:48,448 --> 01:17:49,691
I don't care what you've done.

1132
01:17:49,774 --> 01:17:52,524
Let me tell you I won't
let you take this decision.

1133
01:17:52,774 --> 01:17:53,983
What do you mean you won't let me?

1134
01:17:54,189 --> 01:17:55,816
Who are you to tell me?

1135
01:18:01,233 --> 01:18:02,899
What do you mean who am I to tell you?

1136
01:18:03,233 --> 01:18:04,358
I am concerned for you.

1137
01:18:05,649 --> 01:18:07,877
You need not be concerned for me.

1138
01:18:09,274 --> 01:18:10,274
Please leave.

1139
01:18:11,441 --> 01:18:12,608
Leave!

1140
01:18:13,150 --> 01:18:14,274
Go to hell!

1141
01:18:15,923 --> 01:18:18,549
I don't want to stay in this house.

1142
01:18:26,573 --> 01:18:27,835
My mobile.

1143
01:18:32,578 --> 01:18:34,108
What color do you
want to paint the room?

1144
01:18:34,358 --> 01:18:35,319
Blue or pink?

1145
01:18:35,399 --> 01:18:36,733
Can it be peach?

1146
01:18:36,816 --> 01:18:38,316
- It can.
- Yellow?

1147
01:18:38,747 --> 01:18:39,858
I'll get it done.

1148
01:18:41,338 --> 01:18:42,608
Have tea.

1149
01:18:43,316 --> 01:18:44,816
Drink it already.

1150
01:18:47,636 --> 01:18:49,066
You feel sorry now, don't you?

1151
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:51,274
You say sorry.

1152
01:18:51,756 --> 01:18:53,899
- it's okay.
- Say sorry.

1153
01:18:54,233 --> 01:18:55,816
I told you it's okay.

1154
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:02,899
Tell me. Messi or Ronaldo?

1155
01:19:02,983 --> 01:19:04,778
Saurav dada. Ganguli.

1156
01:19:04,858 --> 01:19:07,441
You Bengalis bring
Bengalis into everything.

1157
01:19:07,521 --> 01:19:09,308
Both are favorites to Bengalis.

1158
01:19:11,358 --> 01:19:13,399
Really? You like cricket so much?

1159
01:19:13,483 --> 01:19:14,983
Not cricket. Cricketers.

1160
01:19:25,066 --> 01:19:26,608
Come in.

1161
01:19:30,149 --> 01:19:31,233
Hi.

1162
01:19:32,441 --> 01:19:34,441
We want the kid.

1163
01:19:35,652 --> 01:19:37,191
Which kid?

1164
01:19:38,876 --> 01:19:40,804
Shekhar,
I won't give this child to you.

1165
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:46,733
I felt it would be good that
this matter be resolved smoothly.

1166
01:19:46,816 --> 01:19:48,941
Really? Or else?

1167
01:19:52,626 --> 01:19:54,649
Or else the law is with us.

1168
01:19:54,733 --> 01:19:59,621
Listen, bro. You don't realize
you are threatening us in our house.

1169
01:19:59,774 --> 01:20:01,278
Come outside with me.

1170
01:20:01,358 --> 01:20:02,778
Come on out!

1171
01:20:02,858 --> 01:20:04,361
Hey, lady justice! Let's go.

1172
01:20:04,441 --> 01:20:05,774
Move!

1173
01:20:06,821 --> 01:20:08,108
Get lost!

1174
01:20:09,149 --> 01:20:12,341
Brother. Don't force me. Go on. Leave.

1175
01:20:12,821 --> 01:20:14,149
Do you want to stay here?

1176
01:20:14,983 --> 01:20:16,997
Hold on, son. Hold on.

1177
01:20:18,021 --> 01:20:20,077
Greetings. Greetings, son.

1178
01:20:20,157 --> 01:20:24,191
Finally I got to see
the boy face to face.

1179
01:20:24,682 --> 01:20:26,108
Come here, Shipra.

1180
01:20:26,816 --> 01:20:29,205
Look. Look. Take a good look..

1181
01:20:29,285 --> 01:20:34,301
..to see how demons look in
these times. This is how they look.

1182
01:20:34,605 --> 01:20:36,358
- Excuse me?
- Tell me something.

1183
01:20:37,483 --> 01:20:45,111
If your daddy had fallen ill,
would you get rid of him as well?

1184
01:20:45,191 --> 01:20:48,917
Look, you have no right
to speak in our matter.

1185
01:20:48,997 --> 01:20:51,611
Hey! Hey! Ms. Goody two shoes!

1186
01:20:51,691 --> 01:20:54,108
Does that make sense!
You accept the child when you wish..

1187
01:20:54,191 --> 01:20:56,191
..and you reject
the child when you wish.

1188
01:20:56,274 --> 01:20:57,316
Like hell!

1189
01:20:57,396 --> 01:21:00,361
You know what?
Now I will make sure I take this baby.

1190
01:21:00,441 --> 01:21:01,483
Let's go.

1191
01:21:01,566 --> 01:21:03,486
- Yeah, go!
- Go.

1192
01:21:03,566 --> 01:21:05,108
Listen to me.

1193
01:21:06,066 --> 01:21:09,816
You better think
before you do anything.

1194
01:21:11,441 --> 01:21:14,519
We are Punjabis, and in this matter..!

1195
01:21:15,569 --> 01:21:20,087
We don't have a good reputation.
Especially him.

1196
01:21:20,274 --> 01:21:23,191
Wow! That's wonderful, aunt!

1197
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:29,691
Wait one minute, child.

1198
01:21:33,518 --> 01:21:36,006
Can I get one cup of tea?

1199
01:21:36,149 --> 01:21:38,358
The tea my sister
prepares is horrible.

1200
01:21:40,723 --> 01:21:42,524
Please come in, papa.

1201
01:21:43,903 --> 01:21:45,566
I'll be there shortly, sister.

1202
01:21:47,983 --> 01:21:49,066
Come.

1203
01:21:49,932 --> 01:21:53,140
- Let it go. I shall prepare it.
- I don't want tea prepared by you.

1204
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:56,504
- I prepare good tea.
- You don't know anything.

1205
01:22:14,302 --> 01:22:15,649
Rano!

1206
01:22:16,029 --> 01:22:17,108
Rano!

1207
01:22:17,469 --> 01:22:18,236
Rano!

1208
01:22:19,899 --> 01:22:21,024
Hurry up!

1209
01:22:21,108 --> 01:22:22,212
What is the matter?

1210
01:22:22,691 --> 01:22:23,903
My water broke.

1211
01:22:23,983 --> 01:22:25,079
What?

1212
01:22:25,316 --> 01:22:27,486
- Dad! Dad!
- What is it?

1213
01:22:27,566 --> 01:22:30,524
- Calm down.
- Damn! Rano, bring the car. Go.

1214
01:22:30,608 --> 01:22:32,069
- Hurry!
- Yes.

1215
01:22:32,149 --> 01:22:34,806
Bring the car!

1216
01:22:35,024 --> 01:22:37,116
Come, my child. Take it easy.

1217
01:22:40,524 --> 01:22:41,608
Sister!

1218
01:22:41,688 --> 01:22:45,380
Sister! Hurry up. It is
time to take her to the hospital.

1219
01:22:45,774 --> 01:22:48,111
It is important.

1220
01:22:48,191 --> 01:22:49,941
The paper that Shekhar signed.

1221
01:22:50,024 --> 01:22:50,955
Which paper?

1222
01:22:51,035 --> 01:22:53,944
He doesn't want the child.
It is with the Doctor.

1223
01:22:54,024 --> 01:22:56,636
What is the matter?

1224
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,192
Take care.

1225
01:23:01,072 --> 01:23:05,104
Don't be nervous. We will follow you.

1226
01:23:15,691 --> 01:23:17,108
Come. Come, son. Come, my dear.

1227
01:23:17,441 --> 01:23:18,649
Come. Come.

1228
01:23:19,232 --> 01:23:21,411
Stretcher!
Bring the stretcher! Please.

1229
01:23:22,813 --> 01:23:24,644
Come. Come. Easy.

1230
01:23:25,152 --> 01:23:26,528
- Shekhar.
- Hush.

1231
01:23:26,608 --> 01:23:26,983
No.

1232
01:23:27,066 --> 01:23:28,399
Hush, Nayan.
All you can think of is Shekhar.

1233
01:23:28,479 --> 01:23:29,444
The paper is with the Doctor.

1234
01:23:29,524 --> 01:23:30,649
Move. Move. Move.

1235
01:23:31,563 --> 01:23:34,199
Talk to Shekhar, Rano. Rano.

1236
01:23:36,144 --> 01:23:37,568
Listen, Rano.

1237
01:23:37,648 --> 01:23:39,395
Don't talk. Don't talk, Nayan.

1238
01:23:39,691 --> 01:23:41,193
I don't want to give
my baby to anybody, Rano.

1239
01:23:41,273 --> 01:23:44,191
Listen. As long as I am
here nobody can touch your baby.

1240
01:23:44,374 --> 01:23:46,982
Just concentrate on giving
birth to the baby now.

1241
01:23:47,062 --> 01:23:48,358
- Yes.
- Okay? Don't think much.

1242
01:23:48,441 --> 01:23:49,483
I'm feeling scared, papa.

1243
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:50,816
You'll be okay, child.
You'll be okay.

1244
01:23:50,899 --> 01:23:52,233
I will be out here, Nayan.

1245
01:23:53,608 --> 01:23:55,825
Doctor, Shekhar had signed a form.

1246
01:23:56,104 --> 01:23:57,441
It said he does not want the baby.

1247
01:23:57,521 --> 01:23:58,358
- Yes.
- Where is that form?

1248
01:23:58,438 --> 01:23:59,399
It's there.

1249
01:23:59,941 --> 01:24:01,399
- Krishna.
- Yes, ma'am.

1250
01:24:01,483 --> 01:24:03,066
Give him Nayan's file from my cabin.

1251
01:24:03,149 --> 01:24:04,316
Yes, ma'am

1252
01:24:04,613 --> 01:24:06,676
- Take care of her.
- Let's go, Rano.

1253
01:24:07,854 --> 01:24:09,983
Let's go. Hurry up!

1254
01:24:26,373 --> 01:24:28,334
I don't see the file.
Ms. Nayan's file is not here.

1255
01:24:28,414 --> 01:24:29,486
What do you mean it's not here?

1256
01:24:29,566 --> 01:24:31,191
Where is the file if it is not here?

1257
01:24:31,274 --> 01:24:32,899
You could check the records room.

1258
01:24:33,219 --> 01:24:34,780
Okay. Okay.

1259
01:25:07,311 --> 01:25:09,028
Don't stop me today, dad.

1260
01:25:09,108 --> 01:25:10,838
Let's go, you twit!

1261
01:25:12,761 --> 01:25:14,899
Hey! Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on, brother.

1262
01:25:14,983 --> 01:25:16,024
Hold on.

1263
01:25:18,022 --> 01:25:19,116
Which floor?

1264
01:25:19,274 --> 01:25:20,278
Any.

1265
01:25:20,358 --> 01:25:22,418
He means the same. The same.

1266
01:25:50,651 --> 01:25:51,500
That way.

1267
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:52,831
It says so over there, dad.

1268
01:25:52,911 --> 01:25:55,983
Where does it say so?
Let's go. Let's go.

1269
01:26:05,222 --> 01:26:07,153
We have a little business
inside for a minute.

1270
01:26:07,233 --> 01:26:09,161
This is a restricted area, sir.
It is only for the staff.

1271
01:26:09,241 --> 01:26:10,548
Please stay outside.

1272
01:26:10,772 --> 01:26:12,028
Alright.

1273
01:26:12,108 --> 01:26:13,774
Easy. He's my dad.

1274
01:26:13,948 --> 01:26:15,372
Please.

1275
01:26:19,171 --> 01:26:21,872
Aunt is not around when you need
her the most. She's not here today.

1276
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:23,778
If she were here she would have..

1277
01:26:23,858 --> 01:26:26,003
Why are you worrying?
Her brother is here.

1278
01:26:26,083 --> 01:26:27,358
What will you do?

1279
01:26:32,779 --> 01:26:35,244
Hey, brother! Please take a look.

1280
01:26:39,882 --> 01:26:41,834
Yes. Doctor.

1281
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:37,676
What are you doing over here?

1282
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:02,441
Where is it?

1283
01:28:04,203 --> 01:28:05,768
Where is Nayan's paper?

1284
01:28:05,848 --> 01:28:08,276
Stop. I'll give it to you.

1285
01:28:12,946 --> 01:28:14,649
Which number is it?

1286
01:28:15,243 --> 01:28:16,274
Number two.

1287
01:28:17,035 --> 01:28:18,024
Don't move!

1288
01:28:33,599 --> 01:28:34,441
Sorry.

1289
01:28:42,215 --> 01:28:44,474
Move.

1290
01:28:45,193 --> 01:28:47,566
Stop the overacting.
Stop it. The job is done.

1291
01:28:47,649 --> 01:28:48,483
Get up!

1292
01:28:50,682 --> 01:28:51,759
Let's go.

1293
01:29:07,006 --> 01:29:09,399
Congratulations! It's a girl.

1294
01:29:13,267 --> 01:29:15,586
Is her health alright, Doctor?

1295
01:29:15,666 --> 01:29:18,917
A minor surgery will have
to be done after some time.

1296
01:29:18,997 --> 01:29:20,309
After that she should be fine.

1297
01:29:20,826 --> 01:29:22,399
Okay.

1298
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:24,528
How is Nayan, Doctor?

1299
01:29:24,608 --> 01:29:26,191
Nayan is also perfectly alright.

1300
01:29:30,693 --> 01:29:31,691
No. No.

1301
01:29:31,774 --> 01:29:34,051
Yes. No. Please take her away.

1302
01:29:39,932 --> 01:29:45,271
Even you were tiny, Rano. Come here.

1303
01:30:31,671 --> 01:30:33,399
I'll be back in a minute.

1304
01:30:33,483 --> 01:30:34,649
Listen.

1305
01:30:35,861 --> 01:30:38,608
You said you don't bother
talking to women like me.

1306
01:30:44,348 --> 01:30:45,316
How are you feeling?

1307
01:30:45,399 --> 01:30:48,759
Like a king feels after winning a war.

1308
01:30:49,873 --> 01:30:51,899
You never have a straight
answer for anything.

1309
01:30:52,567 --> 01:30:54,652
I am asking you if you are okay.

1310
01:30:55,272 --> 01:30:56,858
You tell me. How do I look?

1311
01:31:15,041 --> 01:31:17,729
My baby.

1312
01:31:18,705 --> 01:31:22,774
For some unknown reason
I feel she looks like you.

1313
01:31:23,524 --> 01:31:26,528
You feel that way because
you've lost your mind, dad.

1314
01:31:26,608 --> 01:31:28,649
Book a bed and get yourself treated.

1315
01:31:29,066 --> 01:31:30,305
He's saying senseless things.

1316
01:31:30,385 --> 01:31:32,985
See for yourself. Take a look.

1317
01:31:42,233 --> 01:31:44,561
She is very beautiful!

1318
01:31:45,108 --> 01:31:47,358
That's why I say,
son, she looks like you.

1319
01:31:47,441 --> 01:31:48,858
How can she look like me?

1320
01:31:49,169 --> 01:31:52,774
- How can she look like me?
- How can she not look like you?

1321
01:31:53,369 --> 01:31:56,833
I have heard when two people live
together for a long period of time..

1322
01:31:56,913 --> 01:31:59,905
..they start to look similar.
They start looking alike.

1323
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:01,611
Now I get it.

1324
01:32:01,691 --> 01:32:04,941
You have troubled her
so much with your talks..

1325
01:32:06,108 --> 01:32:08,897
..this baby took on your looks.

1326
01:32:09,164 --> 01:32:10,816
Very good logic!

1327
01:32:11,316 --> 01:32:12,500
Papa is right.

1328
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:18,774
You say things that make no sense.

1329
01:32:19,608 --> 01:32:22,513
She is like an angel.

1330
01:32:23,137 --> 01:32:24,153
Truly.

1331
01:32:24,233 --> 01:32:27,736
And she has come to tell
us what big fools we are.

1332
01:32:27,816 --> 01:32:29,691
We are dimwits.

1333
01:32:33,316 --> 01:32:36,024
What's going on, dad?
The truth is surfacing today.

1334
01:32:36,961 --> 01:32:39,149
Make fun of me.

1335
01:32:40,681 --> 01:32:43,197
I was thinking unknowingly

1336
01:32:43,277 --> 01:32:47,899
I was going to make
such a big mistake.

1337
01:32:49,525 --> 01:32:55,358
I mean I would have lost
my granddaughter to my stupid ego.

1338
01:32:57,293 --> 01:32:59,149
And an adorable daughter.

1339
01:33:02,254 --> 01:33:04,066
Thank you, papa.

1340
01:33:07,608 --> 01:33:08,941
Thank you, papa.

1341
01:33:09,357 --> 01:33:11,024
Bless you, son!

1342
01:33:22,149 --> 01:33:24,402
Come here! Come here!

1343
01:33:24,698 --> 01:33:26,557
Come! Come!

1344
01:33:43,827 --> 01:33:45,819
Shame on you! Take this, son.

1345
01:33:45,899 --> 01:33:48,236
You should get married now.

1346
01:33:48,316 --> 01:33:50,149
We will get to eat delicious food.

1347
01:33:50,233 --> 01:33:52,761
We will do the snake dance.

1348
01:33:52,841 --> 01:33:55,176
You want to eat food or...

1349
01:33:55,256 --> 01:33:58,361
Why do you always lose your temper?
He is right.

1350
01:33:58,441 --> 01:34:00,447
I see. I should get married because
he wants to eat delicious food?

1351
01:34:00,527 --> 01:34:02,399
No. For the snake dance.

1352
01:34:04,451 --> 01:34:06,441
You want to get married?

1353
01:34:06,524 --> 01:34:09,566
- No, I am not at all interested.
- I am not interested either.

1354
01:34:09,649 --> 01:34:11,694
It is decided.
We don't want to get married.

1355
01:34:11,774 --> 01:34:13,986
Why not? Get married.
You live together anyway.

1356
01:34:14,066 --> 01:34:17,310
Oh, no! They are fine
just the way they are.

1357
01:34:18,437 --> 01:34:21,574
You should stay just as you are.

1358
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:25,278
Didn't you notice how he got there
in an instant to take care of her?

1359
01:34:25,358 --> 01:34:27,691
He has become the baby's father.

1360
01:34:27,774 --> 01:34:30,175
He even told his father to come here.

1361
01:34:30,255 --> 01:34:34,675
Did you notice how
the aunt was dancing?
