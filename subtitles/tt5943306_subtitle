1
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,820
ALI THE MONSTER

2
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,180
Underwear! Best of the best!

3
00:02:46,397 --> 00:02:48,647
Colorful, fragrant, design!

4
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,840
Any color, design, size and flavor.

5
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:53,860
Party's underwear! For common and superior men!

6
00:02:53,938 --> 00:02:56,897
Anyway. Blue, yellow, orange and gray.

7
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,897
Disco for the kings of the night.

8
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,022
Fluorescent underwear with elastic or not.

9
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,397
Elastic and plastic.

10
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,313
Chota Bheem underwear and Doraemon children.

11
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,730
Tiger skin for adults. Guaranteed.

12
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:10,605
Bones were broken, but no underpants!

13
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,820
Underpants!

14
00:03:13,438 --> 00:03:15,772
- How much are these? - only forty rupees.

15
00:03:15,855 --> 00:03:17,700
Company promotion, public benefit.

16
00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:19,605
Forty rupees too.

17
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,480
You can spend 60 rupees in alcohol, falling into a ditch and grovel.

18
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:27,105
But you can not buy something that would save their honor by 40 rupees?

19
00:03:27,605 --> 00:03:28,638
I do not want them.

20
00:03:29,105 --> 00:03:31,438
Look, here's underwear!

21
00:03:31,522 --> 00:03:32,813
¡Do!

22
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,780
Said that garantizabas lifetime.

23
00:03:39,022 --> 00:03:40,855
But it broke in five days.

24
00:03:40,938 --> 00:03:44,105
Man, I thought I would not live more than five days.

25
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,272
Therefore I said for life. But you have lived a week.

26
00:03:46,355 --> 00:03:48,022
Do not be fooled my age.

27
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,680
Last week my wife gave birth to a son.

28
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,500
That's merit Aunt ... Wait.

29
00:03:54,897 --> 00:03:57,397
Take these imported silk.

30
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,580
Blessed you and your underpants.

31
00:03:59,902 --> 00:04:01,060
Ten, Take them!

32
00:04:01,397 --> 00:04:03,100
Give me broken!

33
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,120
Or I have bad luck,

34
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,813
or people do not like to wear underwear.

35
00:04:09,897 --> 00:04:11,360
Today I have not sold anything!

36
00:04:15,063 --> 00:04:16,230
- Uncle. - What?

37
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,522
- Do you sell underwear? - No, I'm from Kabul. Buy dried fruit.

38
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:21,647
I have received these flying. "Do you sell underwear?"

39
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,770
Uncle, today I'm kind of zuperman dress.

40
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:26,230
¿Zuperman? What is that?

41
00:04:26,522 --> 00:04:29,647
Zuperman.

42
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,438
- Superman? - Yes.

43
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:33,938
Long ago I am trying to say Zuperman.

44
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,313
You say very well. I hear it wrong.

45
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:37,647
What underpants want?

46
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,855
- Led. - ¿Ice?

47
00:04:40,022 --> 00:04:41,080
Taking.

48
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:43,260
Is there tester?

49
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,272
Who is tested underpants?

50
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:46,855
In addition, you will carry out.

51
00:04:47,438 --> 00:04:50,522
Why do not you go behind that bike and you change?

52
00:04:50,605 --> 00:04:53,938
Come. Try them here. Or not you hide behind a truck.

53
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,188
- Put them here. - Voucher.

54
00:04:55,272 --> 00:04:56,772
And if you're wearing them?

55
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,188
I can not put me, I tightened.

56
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:01,938
They have to tighten.

57
00:05:02,188 --> 00:05:04,813
You have a huge waist so young.

58
00:05:04,897 --> 00:05:06,480
- Hippopotamus. - What did you say?

59
00:05:06,563 --> 00:05:08,313
Hippopotamus!

60
00:05:08,397 --> 00:05:10,980
That's no way to treat children.

61
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,230
You're a child? Children are not like you.

62
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,480
If you were born in installments, you'd have four or five children.

63
00:05:16,688 --> 00:05:19,730
If I put wheels'd look one minicar.

64
00:05:19,813 --> 00:05:22,855
- Outside! If I see you ... - What are you gonna do?

65
00:05:22,938 --> 00:05:24,397
Well...

66
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,147
I'll bring a crane to kick you!

67
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,188
Father!

68
00:05:37,688 --> 00:05:38,705
Boss!

69
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:41,605
You see, boss.

70
00:05:42,063 --> 00:05:43,647
It is a living and insolent child.

71
00:05:45,063 --> 00:05:47,147
Calls you, the owner of my shop, Dad!

72
00:05:47,522 --> 00:05:49,397
You want a free underwear.

73
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,300
And if it is so, imagine the father!

74
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:53,720
He's my son.

75
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:57,188
Your son?

76
00:05:58,355 --> 00:05:59,647
This kite is yours.

77
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,313
What monkey.

78
00:06:03,522 --> 00:06:04,800
What face.

79
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,063
I knew right away.

80
00:06:07,147 --> 00:06:10,230
This large property must belong to a great man.

81
00:06:10,313 --> 00:06:12,140
You can not sell or underwear!

82
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,300
How well you speak to my son?

83
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,813
- Out of here. - Okay, I'm going.

84
00:06:17,897 --> 00:06:19,560
- Get lost! - I'm going.

85
00:06:26,438 --> 00:06:28,080
Why do I bother?

86
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,940
You know we have a direct connection.

87
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,760
You do not want to make money?

88
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,730
Everything I do is closed before it can make money.

89
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,522
How will I take care of mom if I do not make money?

90
00:06:42,438 --> 00:06:45,700
Someone let me know at your door.

91
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:49,563
And mom took me home and raised me.

92
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,772
Stop.

93
00:06:52,855 --> 00:06:54,605
You've played enough with Ali.

94
00:06:57,105 --> 00:06:59,397
You can do it all. Hear the prayers.

95
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,647
Listen and fulfill your wishes.

96
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,000
And I'm your son. Why do you not listen to me?

97
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,340
Apáñame a good deal.

98
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,920
Show me a way. Opens a door.

99
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:15,355
When a man closes a door,

100
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,480
God opens many.

101
00:07:23,813 --> 00:07:25,272
Chief 300 000 Dahisar.

102
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,620
Chief 200 000 Kalyan.

103
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,180
Chief 400 000 Dombivli.

104
00:07:34,147 --> 00:07:36,355
Chief Chincpokli 11000 rupees.

105
00:07:42,938 --> 00:07:44,313
What are you laughing?

106
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,220
Is protection money or a donation?

107
00:07:46,563 --> 00:07:49,340
Chief, these people just gave 7000 rupees.

108
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,080
I added own 4000 rupees.

109
00:07:51,147 --> 00:07:54,230
- I thought I would feel bad, and ... - Okay, get out.

110
00:07:54,813 --> 00:07:56,640
Boss! Ahead.

111
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,860
Look who I brought.

112
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,897
Ya, it's your father.

113
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,760
Hi Uncle.

114
00:08:04,772 --> 00:08:07,060
Head, not my father.

115
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,147
I first listen.

116
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,520
The boss does not like it completely.

117
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,280
The boss is not going to end not with a girl.

118
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:14,563
Right, boss?

119
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,200
If not your father, who is?

120
00:08:18,272 --> 00:08:20,020
Its very good.

121
00:08:20,105 --> 00:08:21,663
It has properties worth millions.

122
00:08:22,188 --> 00:08:23,188
Disburses the money.

123
00:08:24,147 --> 00:08:26,960
- Who did you boss? - What?

124
00:08:27,063 --> 00:08:28,063
Nothing, boss.

125
00:08:28,147 --> 00:08:30,563
You will pay, but there is a small problem.

126
00:08:31,397 --> 00:08:33,740
head injury in an accident.

127
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,380
He has forgotten where he hid all the money and gems.

128
00:08:39,605 --> 00:08:41,897
If you have lost your memory, what good is?

129
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,272
Why did you bring?

130
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:45,380
What if he retracts to recover memory?

131
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,660
If he stays, he will be with us.

132
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,400
When you retrieve the memory,

133
00:08:50,855 --> 00:08:52,563
We obtain all their property.

134
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:54,897
How did you recover?

135
00:08:57,522 --> 00:09:00,897
Son, I heard that eating nuts and almonds

136
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,730
It helps restore memory.

137
00:09:04,188 --> 00:09:05,360
Great, man.

138
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,480
Remember nuts, but no where to put the money.

139
00:09:08,563 --> 00:09:10,147
- Boys. - Yes Boss.

140
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,480
Give him what he wants, but should recover the memory.

141
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,605
Business is loose. And to make matters worse, the Big Boss puts pressure.

142
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:19,480
Jojo, what about that old?

143
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,730
Chief, that old is very clever.

144
00:09:21,813 --> 00:09:23,147
Always has an excuse.

145
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,397
Do not you serve me for nothing.

146
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,772
This old man does not know where your money.

147
00:09:27,897 --> 00:09:30,147
And that old remembers everything,

148
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,440
but you do not want to pay.

149
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:33,105
I wonder when get paid.

150
00:09:47,022 --> 00:09:49,272
Hey, old, why not pay?

151
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,855
It does much to make excuses.

152
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,855
For the last time, are you going to pay or not?

153
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,480
That tongue!

154
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,860
Do not you know who you're talking about?

155
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,272
With Padmavati, Queen Nawallgarh district.

156
00:10:00,355 --> 00:10:01,600
Long live the Queen!

157
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:04,313
Highness, what is the problem to pay protection?

158
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,480
We do not charge that money for personal gain.

159
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:08,800
It's for your safety.

160
00:10:09,147 --> 00:10:12,813
I am a Rajput. I can protect myself. It is understood!

161
00:10:13,022 --> 00:10:14,647
What else is going to do at this age?

162
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,313
It's a queen, not a maid.

163
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:18,980
We will give you security.

164
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,200
I will not live much longer.

165
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:23,563
Maybe five or ten years.

166
00:10:23,813 --> 00:10:24,940
That's his problem.

167
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,980
We did not tell you was born so soon.

168
00:10:27,063 --> 00:10:28,460
- Right, Maqsood? - Yes.

169
00:10:28,563 --> 00:10:29,688
Listen, Your Highness.

170
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:31,760
This is my first collection.

171
00:10:32,522 --> 00:10:33,772
That's why I'm polite.

172
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,980
But this man is very dangerous.

173
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:42,580
I brought a guy that does not end up killing someone.

174
00:10:43,563 --> 00:10:44,600
Look at that.

175
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,620
I'm like your child.

176
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,640
My son is not a scoundrel like you.

177
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,855
It is a crown prince, you know?

178
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:55,680
¿Yuvraj Singh is his son?

179
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,780
Stupid, it is the prince of our family.

180
00:11:00,022 --> 00:11:04,220
If you had been here, he would have beheaded with a sword.

181
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,355
Chief, give me two punches.

182
00:11:07,563 --> 00:11:08,680
Let's go.

183
00:11:09,397 --> 00:11:10,688
It is bothering a lot.

184
00:11:13,022 --> 00:11:14,460
Hey, witch, who called?

185
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,480
Ramu, open the door.

186
00:11:17,563 --> 00:11:18,800
Ramu is tied.

187
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,360
Highness, open the door.

188
00:11:24,438 --> 00:11:26,063
- Who is, Maqsood? - I do not know.

189
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,855
I come to collect water filter.

190
00:11:29,938 --> 00:11:32,240
Yes. Payment is ready since yesterday.

191
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,897
- Thirty-two thousand rupees. - Yes.

192
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,740
And 1000 rupees tip that I give.

193
00:11:36,813 --> 00:11:38,220
- Haunted. - Thank you.

194
00:11:40,688 --> 00:11:42,520
Have money to pay,

195
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,820
and we? Long ago we asked.

196
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,230
Try not get me money like you.

197
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,105
He worked hard to install the filter.

198
00:11:50,313 --> 00:11:53,120
We have also worked hard, we've asked you to pay.

199
00:11:53,897 --> 00:11:56,647
We hours here. There has not given us no water!

200
00:11:56,855 --> 00:11:58,397
Have you bought the filter for swimming?

201
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,355
I am a queen.

202
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,680
What do you care if it is to bathe or drink?

203
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,605
Who is now Maqsood?

204
00:12:06,647 --> 00:12:10,500
Highness, here is the certificate million donated for our NGO.

205
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,860
- Thank you. - Thank you.

206
00:12:15,063 --> 00:12:16,780
It has given our money to the NGO.

207
00:12:17,022 --> 00:12:18,522
It's my last warning, ma'am.

208
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,022
Will you pay or not?

209
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:23,040
Decide first what is your last warning.

210
00:12:23,105 --> 00:12:27,397
You've said several times: "It's my last warning."

211
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,720
- This was the last. - Maqsood, a moment.

212
00:12:29,813 --> 00:12:30,880
Calm.

213
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,940
Highness, a shroud has no pockets.

214
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,040
And you can not transfer your money up there.

215
00:12:36,438 --> 00:12:38,140
Remember the old days

216
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,605
when he wasted money without concern.

217
00:12:40,688 --> 00:12:43,880
- Ten. Taking. And you. - What?

218
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,260
His treasure among the poor.

219
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:48,563
Son, you've opened my eyes.

220
00:12:48,813 --> 00:12:50,300
I'll get the money already.

221
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,063
If I had not paid today, he would have killed.

222
00:12:55,147 --> 00:12:57,680
No, Maqsood.

223
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:03,272
The words solve problems that bullets can not.

224
00:13:04,813 --> 00:13:06,540
Who wants the money first?

225
00:13:07,522 --> 00:13:09,522
- Los dos. - Maqsood.

226
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:11,730
Put down the gun, ma'am!

227
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:20,105
¡No!

228
00:13:23,397 --> 00:13:25,647
- Now you try to talk? - I'll try.

229
00:13:27,022 --> 00:13:28,063
Long live the Queen!

230
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,920
Shame for the Queen!

231
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,397
Drop the gun, ma'am.

232
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,188
Release. Give me the gun.

233
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,700
You want money.

234
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,330
You want money!

235
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,720
Ten. Take your money.

236
00:13:56,563 --> 00:13:57,580
Taking.

237
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,240
- Let you! - Shut up!

238
00:14:02,147 --> 00:14:03,980
Are you going to hit a woman?

239
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,480
No, right?

240
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,563
- Let go hand! - Did I break your hand?

241
00:14:10,688 --> 00:14:12,563
Did I break your hand?

242
00:14:13,522 --> 00:14:15,420
Hag, I curse you.

243
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,120
Joints will hurt you until you die.

244
00:14:18,438 --> 00:14:20,480
The worms will eat your body.

245
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,440
You'll end up in the ICU. You'd be given injections, witch!

246
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:25,820
Witch?

247
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,720
Your children...

248
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,180
- Witch! - Let go.

249
00:14:32,397 --> 00:14:33,563
Release him!

250
00:14:42,522 --> 00:14:43,960
- Let's go. - Old witch.

251
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,438
Say "Larga life to the queen."

252
00:15:11,647 --> 00:15:12,938
Maqsood, is very dangerous.

253
00:15:13,022 --> 00:15:14,640
Let's get the money and get out.

254
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,800
Let's go.

255
00:15:16,147 --> 00:15:17,272
- Let's go. - Come on.

256
00:15:18,355 --> 00:15:19,960
Hi boss. Work done.

257
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,160
Come on, boy.

258
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:28,020
- Hey, boss Khatarnak (danger). - In hindi no!

259
00:15:28,105 --> 00:15:29,160
Sorry, boss Danger.

260
00:15:29,855 --> 00:15:33,147
Podíais know that you do it easily.

261
00:15:34,063 --> 00:15:36,605
- Chief, this reminds me of a joke. - Tell me.

262
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,300
There were two guys.

263
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,080
One day they will find an old job.

264
00:15:43,147 --> 00:15:44,222
But...

265
00:15:49,397 --> 00:15:50,430
If then.

266
00:15:51,438 --> 00:15:53,080
There, boss. End of joke.

267
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,438
Only with this job I gained more

268
00:15:59,522 --> 00:16:01,855
than it would have earned selling underpants one month.

269
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,500
What happened, Ali? And these brands?

270
00:16:05,563 --> 00:16:08,520
- Is a tattoo. Want one? - Do not.

271
00:16:08,605 --> 00:16:11,520
- Piérdete. - ¡rogue!

272
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:13,188
scoundrel often.

273
00:16:13,688 --> 00:16:17,563
That old twisted my arm so much that I jumped eyes.

274
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,820
- Ali, come play this game. - Come to play.

275
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,438
Come on, brother. It is the reputation of the people.

276
00:16:23,522 --> 00:16:25,980
You have already lost reputation.

277
00:16:26,105 --> 00:16:28,063
Matter who plays, he or Dhoni.

278
00:16:28,147 --> 00:16:31,022
If you win today, I'll give a prize to everyone.

279
00:16:31,105 --> 00:16:32,000
Shut.

280
00:16:32,063 --> 00:16:35,020
- How many races are needed? - Only 24.

281
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,760
- How many balls are? - Four.

282
00:16:36,855 --> 00:16:39,660
... Twenty four races ... That's four sixes in four balls.

283
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,730
Yes brother.

284
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:41,720
Are you crazy?

285
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:44,563
- Well, we have won. - See how Farda.

286
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:46,680
- Give me the bat. - Shut up. Are you ready!

287
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:52,440
Let's go. Get the ball.

288
00:16:57,647 --> 00:16:58,680
Get lost.

289
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:02,605
Brothers, four sixes.

290
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,340
Ready. Let's go.

291
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:06,700
I'll do four six four balls.

292
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:08,860
I'll tell you where.

293
00:17:09,188 --> 00:17:11,520
- Where should I give the first six o'clock? - Already.

294
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,500
Look at that pitcher.

295
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,700
- That false abroad? - Yes.

296
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:20,080
It is the neighborhood Brett Lee. Play.

297
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,500
- Six! - Bravo, Ali. One more!

298
00:17:38,563 --> 00:17:41,900
It's okay. Bravo! Let's play. Lanza right, man.

299
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,240
Where I hit the second six o'clock?

300
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,740
There.

301
00:17:46,688 --> 00:17:48,647
- At that antenna? - Yes.

302
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,772
Come launches.

303
00:17:56,438 --> 00:17:59,860
DON Whitey! What do you do? Lanza well.

304
00:17:59,938 --> 00:18:01,380
Where I launched the third?

305
00:18:02,688 --> 00:18:03,700
Lánzalo there.

306
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:05,420
- There? - Yes.

307
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,500
- Okay, spear. - Let's go.

308
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,040
Bravo, Ali, one more.

309
00:18:17,147 --> 00:18:20,397
Damn bottle of milk. Stop giving bad name Brett Lee.

310
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:22,730
Last ball, the last six.

311
00:18:22,813 --> 00:18:24,605
- Where? - Stop asking.

312
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:26,355
Launches wherever you want.

313
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,680
Come launches.

314
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,147
Bravo, you'll catch.

315
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,355
- Another six, Ali. - Dale, Ali.

316
00:18:47,272 --> 00:18:49,860
We have won!

317
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:52,640
We have won!

318
00:18:55,355 --> 00:18:57,688
Give back to this false Brett Lee to Australia!

319
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,100
You've been amazing, Ali.

320
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:04,680
Aunt, food smells good.

321
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:07,200
What have you done to your face?

322
00:19:09,355 --> 00:19:12,355
All day on the streets. Metiéndoos in fights.

323
00:19:12,438 --> 00:19:16,060
Stop it, Mom. Here's the money.

324
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:20,355
Thank God, business is going well.

325
00:19:20,647 --> 00:19:21,930
You too you hurt?

326
00:19:23,147 --> 00:19:25,700
Well, you have to sweat blood for a living!

327
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:31,147
It's hard earned money. Look.

328
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,920
- hard-earned money. - Yes!

329
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:35,900
You work hard and the other one gets into fights.

330
00:19:36,313 --> 00:19:39,855
Listen mom, fix the roof before the monsoon.

331
00:19:39,938 --> 00:19:41,520
Or we end up with a pool at home.

332
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,060
Vale.

333
00:19:43,897 --> 00:19:46,022
Ali, stay away from him.

334
00:19:47,355 --> 00:19:49,397
I do not like your manners.

335
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,480
What would your political family if he knew?

336
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,313
Political family? Are you married? Where's the sister?

337
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:59,340
Sister in law!

338
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,560
Still he not married, but I will.

339
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,520
His political family comes in two days.

340
00:20:03,897 --> 00:20:05,188
For their commitment.

341
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,063
And later...

342
00:20:24,688 --> 00:20:28,230
A peacock came flying

343
00:20:28,313 --> 00:20:32,120
It seemed silly but it taught me to dance

344
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:39,230
Turn up the speaker volume and tell everyone

345
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,397
We will not stop dancing until morning

346
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,438
When someone plays the drums We can not stop

347
00:20:53,022 --> 00:20:57,355
I can not do more than dance

348
00:21:00,438 --> 00:21:04,813
Dance till dawn

349
00:21:07,688 --> 00:21:11,355
I can not do more than dance

350
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:15,480
Dance till dawn

351
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:26,272
A peacock came flying

352
00:21:26,355 --> 00:21:29,855
It seemed silly but it taught me to dance

353
00:21:37,147 --> 00:21:41,022
Today we will not listen to anyone

354
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:44,820
And we descontrolaremos menearemos body

355
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,480
Today we will not listen to anyone

356
00:21:51,688 --> 00:21:54,813
And we descontrolaremos menearemos body

357
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,813
Ballad

358
00:21:56,897 --> 00:21:58,480
We are going to have a very good time

359
00:21:58,563 --> 00:22:00,272
Music will be high

360
00:22:00,355 --> 00:22:02,355
We dance to the rhythm and pass well

361
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:08,355
When someone touches the drum We can not stop

362
00:22:09,355 --> 00:22:13,355
I can not do more than dance

363
00:22:16,563 --> 00:22:20,355
Dance till dawn

364
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:27,730
I can not do more than dance

365
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:31,605
Dance till dawn

366
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:38,647
I can not do more than dance

367
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,855
Dance till dawn

368
00:22:52,147 --> 00:22:53,719
Enough of this farce!

369
00:22:58,188 --> 00:22:59,739
This commitment is canceled!

370
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,079
- What do you say? - It is true.

371
00:23:14,813 --> 00:23:16,147
Liar, cheater!

372
00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:18,879
I can not let my daughter marry

373
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,939
with an underwear salesman.

374
00:23:21,688 --> 00:23:23,359
Do you sell underwear?

375
00:23:24,688 --> 00:23:26,699
I think it is wrong.

376
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:30,355
I am not mistaken. In fact, we chose the wrong family.

377
00:23:30,813 --> 00:23:32,230
What is he saying?

378
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:34,522
My son works in the garment industry.

379
00:23:34,899 --> 00:23:37,039
Perhaps he forgot to mention the word "interior".

380
00:23:39,105 --> 00:23:42,359
There is a big difference between "clothes" and "underwear".

381
00:23:53,188 --> 00:23:54,188
And that?

382
00:23:55,272 --> 00:23:57,799
What if my son sells underwear?

383
00:23:58,688 --> 00:23:59,897
At least does something respectable.

384
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,647
Work hard. My son is not a gangster or a thug.

385
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:05,272
We just know your business.

386
00:24:05,355 --> 00:24:08,230
Who knows what else we'll know tomorrow?

387
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:09,438
Then get out.

388
00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:11,479
Find another suitor for his daughter.

389
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:15,605
¡Váyanse!

390
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:16,739
Let's go.

391
00:24:36,147 --> 00:24:38,459
Ali, I just saw that the world moves for money.

392
00:24:39,199 --> 00:24:42,772
If you had a car, a bungalow and all the luxuries of the world,

393
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:44,999
nobody would have asked about your business.

394
00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:48,019
Large companies sell underwear.

395
00:24:48,188 --> 00:24:49,799
Has anyone married to them?

396
00:24:51,272 --> 00:24:53,759
Maqsood, I'm not sad to cancel my commitment.

397
00:24:55,022 --> 00:24:57,855
I'm sad because I did mourn my mother.

398
00:24:59,522 --> 00:25:01,730
Although she belonged to a different community,

399
00:25:01,813 --> 00:25:04,355
I was educated in my religion.

400
00:25:04,522 --> 00:25:06,605
And today she cried because of me.

401
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,980
That's what saddens me.

402
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,599
Your mother is very strong.

403
00:25:11,355 --> 00:25:13,559
Have you not seen how shushed those guys?

404
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:17,438
Let's forget this and get back to work.

405
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:20,522
But today I saw something.

406
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,499
The world moves for money.

407
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,438
Come underpants or hell.

408
00:25:27,313 --> 00:25:29,105
Brother, get up. We need the chair.

409
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:31,272
They have canceled my commitment, have been guests and my wife,

410
00:25:31,355 --> 00:25:33,559
Already you're worried about your chair! Take it!

411
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,279
Come on man.

412
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:39,019
- It broke my shoe, Maqsood. - Yes.

413
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:41,272
Congratulations for your wedding!

414
00:25:41,355 --> 00:25:42,379
¡Do!

415
00:25:45,397 --> 00:25:47,359
I'm spoiled and congratulated me.

416
00:25:47,938 --> 00:25:49,013
Let's go.

417
00:26:01,999 --> 00:26:03,080
What do you play?

418
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:04,479
- golf. - golf?

419
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:06,980
Yes. It's like marbles.

420
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:08,397
It is a sport rich.

421
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,479
But with large marbles.

422
00:26:11,022 --> 00:26:13,499
And they use a stick to get the marble in the hole.

423
00:26:23,855 --> 00:26:24,919
What do you do?

424
00:26:53,647 --> 00:26:55,563
I guess Singhania has no children.

425
00:26:56,022 --> 00:26:57,313
How do you know?

426
00:26:58,379 --> 00:27:00,459
He has not gotten a single ball in the hole.

427
00:27:00,897 --> 00:27:02,019
What would you like, sir?

428
00:27:02,938 --> 00:27:05,897
- Can you get a little house in Bandra? - No sir.

429
00:27:06,105 --> 00:27:07,147
Then why do you ask?

430
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:09,259
You should ask: "What would you like to eat?"

431
00:27:09,522 --> 00:27:10,397
I wanted to say...

432
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,105
But I have no fault of his own house.

433
00:27:13,522 --> 00:27:16,279
- Bring two cups of tea. - Well sir.

434
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:18,397
I do not understand, man.

435
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:20,959
Do we come to collect protection or butane?

436
00:27:21,147 --> 00:27:24,219
- That man does not respect us. - Wait, talk to him.

437
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,379
Singhania, sir.

438
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:30,679
you could not get a single ball.

439
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,522
He thinks it's easy.

440
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,319
It's not that difficult.

441
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,513
Come here.

442
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:38,647
I mean it.

443
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,480
- Come on. - I'm going.

444
00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:46,419
Note, this is a stick, a ball and that there is a hole. Goes.

445
00:27:46,772 --> 00:27:48,063
Forget it. Do it, Maqsood.

446
00:27:48,147 --> 00:27:49,519
You come.

447
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,899
They do not give so good? Come on.

448
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,619
- That hole with the flag? - Yes.

449
00:27:58,855 --> 00:28:00,379
- Voucher? - Yeah, okay.

450
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:12,938
Faster, more.

451
00:28:13,022 --> 00:28:14,063
- Give him another. - Yes sir.

452
00:28:14,147 --> 00:28:15,188
This was easy.

453
00:28:15,855 --> 00:28:16,888
Genial.

454
00:28:24,688 --> 00:28:26,139
Other! Quick!

455
00:28:37,855 --> 00:28:38,939
Ready?

456
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:41,397
Is nothing. Let's go.

457
00:28:41,605 --> 00:28:43,313
- Let's go. - Come on, Maqsood.

458
00:28:48,438 --> 00:28:49,579
What are we doing here?

459
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:52,397
- Make the putt. - What?

460
00:28:52,813 --> 00:28:54,279
Put the ball in the hole.

461
00:28:54,813 --> 00:28:56,022
- Give putter. - Yes sir.

462
00:28:56,438 --> 00:28:58,522
- I can do this too. - Ten.

463
00:28:59,563 --> 00:29:00,799
- From here? - Yes.

464
00:29:08,355 --> 00:29:09,813
Sido not repay.

465
00:29:10,355 --> 00:29:12,230
- sido not repay. - ¿pay?

466
00:29:12,647 --> 00:29:15,647
You take three hours playing and have not given once a fluke.

467
00:29:16,105 --> 00:29:17,647
Oh yeah? Give this.

468
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:21,997
- In the same hole? - Yes.

469
00:29:26,855 --> 00:29:27,919
It has also entered.

470
00:29:29,397 --> 00:29:30,563
This too.

471
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:31,997
Is.

472
00:29:41,938 --> 00:29:43,647
- Great, Ali. - Anything else?

473
00:29:44,897 --> 00:29:46,059
How did you do it?

474
00:29:47,688 --> 00:29:50,039
- He spent no more. - What do you mean?

475
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:53,480
Since childhood I know all about holes.

476
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:56,659
Holes in my home, on the road in my life.

477
00:29:56,855 --> 00:29:59,855
I know more about these holes holes.

478
00:30:01,522 --> 00:30:05,859
Mr. Singhania, enough holes. Let's talk about money.

479
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:07,772
Bring the briefcase.

480
00:30:13,522 --> 00:30:14,855
- Let's go. - Thank you.

481
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,013
Thank you.

482
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,679
- How did you do it? - I'll tell you when I know.

483
00:30:20,438 --> 00:30:21,599
What is he doing here?

484
00:30:22,438 --> 00:30:23,999
Is our "Old Monk" local?

485
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:29,147
Let's move on.

486
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,239
Hide it.

487
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,219
First he hid the underwear business.

488
00:30:37,397 --> 00:30:38,522
And now this?

489
00:30:40,355 --> 00:30:41,188
You see when it comes.

490
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:44,105
I think the old man has told everything to my mother.

491
00:30:46,938 --> 00:30:51,230
Ali, why do you go to sneak into your house like a thief?

492
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:52,938
Go to hell, man!

493
00:30:53,022 --> 00:30:54,959
God! Broom! Cleaning path.

494
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:57,639
Ali, what are you doing outside? Enters.

495
00:31:02,272 --> 00:31:03,330
Come in.

496
00:31:05,813 --> 00:31:06,888
What?

497
00:31:08,897 --> 00:31:11,188
- What is this that you have told me? - What?

498
00:31:11,272 --> 00:31:13,647
- Nothing. - What do you mean?

499
00:31:13,813 --> 00:31:19,438
Ali, I told you everything. You play good golf.

500
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,272
- It's just ... - What?

501
00:31:23,699 --> 00:31:25,959
I missed the bus for your game.

502
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:30,759
You know that today out of pilgrimage.

503
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,272
- Could not you come before? - You can go tomorrow.

504
00:31:33,355 --> 00:31:35,105
- Leave it alone. - I'll go tomorrow morning.

505
00:31:35,188 --> 00:31:37,019
- A day after is the same. - My tea.

506
00:31:37,647 --> 00:31:38,647
What do you do?

507
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,839
- We must talk business. - Let him finish the tea.

508
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:43,439
You scared me, man.

509
00:31:43,522 --> 00:31:45,730
I thought you were telling Mom about my business.

510
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,188
Son, still not what I said.

511
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:50,397
But if you no amendments, I will tell.

512
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,813
Come on, man.

513
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:56,159
Bribe an innocent boy of thirty-four years for a few thousand rupees!

514
00:31:56,313 --> 00:31:58,105
If you needed money, you could have said.

515
00:31:58,179 --> 00:31:59,239
I would have given it.

516
00:32:00,022 --> 00:32:02,479
I do not want your illegal money, keep it.

517
00:32:04,272 --> 00:32:06,579
Uncle, listen to me. Why do not you take it?

518
00:32:06,647 --> 00:32:09,259
Listen to me. I get it. Wait.

519
00:32:09,355 --> 00:32:10,919
It is common at this age.

520
00:32:11,855 --> 00:32:13,839
Deepa Bar in there is a girl named Sonam.

521
00:32:14,522 --> 00:32:16,819
It is usual Maqsood. You know what I mean.

522
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:19,099
- I will tell. - What?

523
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:21,659
- Sit down. - What do you do?

524
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,139
I hope you have sports.

525
00:32:24,355 --> 00:32:25,419
- Sports? - Yes.

526
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:26,680
Why?

527
00:32:26,938 --> 00:32:29,879
- If there raid, you have to run. - Gross!

528
00:32:30,438 --> 00:32:31,647
What meanest thing?

529
00:32:32,022 --> 00:32:34,539
Maqsood company has spoiled you.

530
00:32:35,105 --> 00:32:37,659
Uncle, do not want money or girls.

531
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:39,938
Have you changed your preference?

532
00:32:40,022 --> 00:32:42,419
Stop barking and listen.

533
00:32:43,188 --> 00:32:46,699
I want you to stop this illegal business and play golf.

534
00:32:46,772 --> 00:32:48,319
- to play what? - golf.

535
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:50,559
Why did not you marry.

536
00:32:51,188 --> 00:32:52,939
You do not know what to play, when and with whom!

537
00:32:56,199 --> 00:32:57,939
I spent my childhood trying to make a living.

538
00:32:58,022 --> 00:33:00,063
And now that almost make it, tell me to play.

539
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:05,730
Dude, I just want to make money.

540
00:33:05,813 --> 00:33:08,063
Money buys everything.

541
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,679
The talent.

542
00:33:11,355 --> 00:33:12,439
That is not purchased.

543
00:33:13,105 --> 00:33:15,480
Talent I've seen you today,

544
00:33:15,563 --> 00:33:18,159
is not achieved even with all the money in the world.

545
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:22,799
But I will show your talent to the world.

546
00:33:23,355 --> 00:33:25,439
I just want your support.

547
00:33:25,897 --> 00:33:27,159
And my business?

548
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:30,299
And the household expenses? America Will he help me?

549
00:33:30,647 --> 00:33:32,399
The course gives a lot of money, Ali.

550
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:35,019
And it's respectable. Follow my advice.

551
00:33:35,563 --> 00:33:38,855
Learn golf for me and play with dedication.

552
00:33:40,397 --> 00:33:42,899
It's your chance to pay the debts of your mother.

553
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:46,219
You can be the golf Sachin!

554
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,980
¡Sachin!

555
00:33:51,105 --> 00:33:52,138
Mom.

556
00:33:54,605 --> 00:33:57,559
Son, I'm going to pilgrimage. Beware.

557
00:33:57,855 --> 00:34:01,105
Do not skip meals and do not hang out with Maqsood.

558
00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:02,399
Take care of yourself too.

559
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,679
And do not touch unattended bags. Like me.

560
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,279
- Quick, Sulbha. Or late. - Voucher.

561
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:09,539
Beware. Goodbye.

562
00:34:13,438 --> 00:34:16,819
- Where will the storm? - Mom goes pilgrimage.

563
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,999
That means peace and quiet in the neighborhood.

564
00:34:19,563 --> 00:34:20,897
We need to collect money.

565
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,359
I have to go to the club to learn golf.

566
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:25,379
Golf? You played one day,

567
00:34:25,539 --> 00:34:27,230
and you do not see more than the ball and the hole.

568
00:34:27,313 --> 00:34:29,897
Learn the alphabet does not make you a scholar.

569
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,438
Forget the golf and we will work.

570
00:34:32,522 --> 00:34:34,355
Uncle Kishan ...

571
00:34:34,499 --> 00:34:36,219
Who? Old Monk

572
00:34:36,438 --> 00:34:38,688
He says he will make me a champion. That says.

573
00:34:38,772 --> 00:34:41,272
He never married and want to get yourself a girlfriend.

574
00:34:41,397 --> 00:34:43,397
It's what I explained to him, but not listen.

575
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:44,813
Says that if I do case to him,

576
00:34:44,897 --> 00:34:47,605
- he will tell Mom what our business. - Damned...

577
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:48,938
How you will tell Mom?

578
00:34:49,522 --> 00:34:50,980
I did not shoot him before?

579
00:34:51,063 --> 00:34:53,359
Anyway, let no one dies in the neighborhood ago.

580
00:34:53,563 --> 00:34:55,159
No. We owe a lot.

581
00:34:55,397 --> 00:34:58,479
When Dad died, he took care of me and my mother.

582
00:34:58,939 --> 00:35:00,022
- You too? - Yes.

583
00:35:00,105 --> 00:35:01,188
What do you mean?

584
00:35:01,647 --> 00:35:03,855
- Let's play golf. - What have you said?

585
00:35:18,647 --> 00:35:19,979
- Regards. - Regards.

586
00:35:20,272 --> 00:35:21,919
- Regards. - Goodbye.

587
00:35:23,499 --> 00:35:24,730
What's he doing here, Ali?

588
00:35:24,899 --> 00:35:26,605
I asked you why you came into this world?

589
00:35:26,688 --> 00:35:28,899
I have come to see the game Ali and understand yours.

590
00:35:29,979 --> 00:35:33,147
Ali, outsiders can not play here.

591
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,379
But we are not out. We are here.

592
00:35:36,647 --> 00:35:37,739
He laughs.

593
00:35:37,855 --> 00:35:41,105
Ali, I told you not listen to the old monk.

594
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:42,480
- Let's go back. - Come on.

595
00:35:42,563 --> 00:35:43,579
Wait, Ali.

596
00:35:45,355 --> 00:35:48,519
Just for my 20 years of service and your game yesterday

597
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:51,199
They have given us permission to play.

598
00:35:52,313 --> 00:35:54,179
And permission is for one person.

599
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,599
I just remembered a joke.

600
00:35:59,313 --> 00:36:01,459
Once a guy brought his friend.

601
00:36:02,188 --> 00:36:04,855
But an old humiliates him.

602
00:36:04,938 --> 00:36:06,647
He says, "Get out of here".

603
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,659
Ali comes to training.

604
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,897
Let's go.

605
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,022
You know a lot of jokes. What say you I knockout?

606
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,779
- Watch this. - No, boss.

607
00:36:37,397 --> 00:36:38,699
Ali, red flag. There.

608
00:36:38,772 --> 00:36:41,188
You always the red flag no matter where the ball is.

609
00:36:41,272 --> 00:36:43,063
- Yesterday you gave. - It's over.

610
00:36:43,313 --> 00:36:44,330
Or.

611
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:49,839
If you have come because

612
00:36:50,355 --> 00:36:54,105
You think I'll tell your mother about your illegal business,

613
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,599
You can go!

614
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:00,139
But remember.

615
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:01,799
What?

616
00:37:02,438 --> 00:37:05,599
Your future depends on a good shot

617
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:08,659
and a bad decision.

618
00:37:09,647 --> 00:37:10,859
Think what you want.

619
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,399
The bad decision?

620
00:37:16,605 --> 00:37:17,938
Or the good shot?

621
00:37:49,938 --> 00:37:50,938
A great shot!

622
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,272
But I have not thrown.

623
00:37:57,105 --> 00:37:59,599
Talk about him, not you.

624
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:10,188
- Who? - Is Ali.

625
00:38:10,313 --> 00:38:11,619
He lives in the next street.

626
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:14,022
Do people in your neighborhood playing golf?

627
00:38:14,147 --> 00:38:16,605
No sir. Until two days ago he sold shorts.

628
00:38:16,688 --> 00:38:19,139
- But now I do not know. - Do you also play the "Gulf"?

629
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:22,399
No es "golfo", se dice "golf".

630
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,359
Sea "golfo" o "golf",

631
00:38:25,699 --> 00:38:27,522
the righteous is unknown to me.

632
00:38:27,759 --> 00:38:29,647
Hello, Ali. Do you know who it is?

633
00:38:29,855 --> 00:38:31,438
Vikram Rathore. Golf champion.

634
00:38:32,438 --> 00:38:33,605
How are you Sir?

635
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,313
How is it going?

636
00:38:37,105 --> 00:38:38,163
Thank you.

637
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:40,379
Today has taught me a good lesson.

638
00:38:41,147 --> 00:38:43,563
Do not give out to anyone after becoming champion.

639
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,659
Only when you become champion.

640
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,147
This is not as easy as selling underwear,

641
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:54,459
you can beg the customer to buy them.

642
00:38:55,105 --> 00:38:58,559
This is golf. It is a game rich.

643
00:38:59,563 --> 00:39:03,938
A poor like you have to sell a kidney to buy a club.

644
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,659
You know what a club?

645
00:39:06,605 --> 00:39:07,699
A brat!

646
00:39:08,355 --> 00:39:09,399
We are poor.

647
00:39:10,355 --> 00:39:13,759
We tear the heart if necessary, a kidney is not that great.

648
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:16,597
If you need it someday, let me know.

649
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:20,139
Another thing. It gives the same play it,

650
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:24,379
the poor earn or learn, never lose. Goodbye.

651
00:39:26,188 --> 00:39:28,480
What is this talk about rich and poor?

652
00:39:28,563 --> 00:39:30,230
Nobody talks about this already.

653
00:39:30,313 --> 00:39:32,479
- Ali, what do you do? - What?

654
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:34,319
It is a golf champion.

655
00:39:35,313 --> 00:39:38,730
You look back and he is ahead of you.

656
00:39:38,938 --> 00:39:39,972
Yes.

657
00:39:48,563 --> 00:39:49,563
Now he is back.

658
00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:52,647
Now we are equal.

659
00:39:54,397 --> 00:39:55,455
Let's go.

660
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:12,179
Goodbye.

661
00:40:16,203 --> 00:40:31,703
Translation and synchronization: 
FaLhIy76

662
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:40,399
Uncle, I've learned to play golf. What are you worried now?

663
00:42:40,739 --> 00:42:44,799
Ali has learned to play golf, but to be an official golfer,

664
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,397
you must participate in the qualifying tournament.

665
00:42:48,647 --> 00:42:49,779
And that ...

666
00:42:50,772 --> 00:42:51,830
We need money.

667
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,313
- How much? - Half a million.

668
00:42:54,397 --> 00:42:57,688
Half a million? You know how many zeros are that?

669
00:42:57,772 --> 00:43:00,647
With that amount, we can marry several girls in the neighborhood

670
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:02,859
and educate all children. Half a million!

671
00:43:04,605 --> 00:43:07,799
Ali, tournament fee,

672
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:11,259
golf equipment, clothing, travel expenses.

673
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:12,772
We need money for that.

674
00:43:14,188 --> 00:43:16,019
You can not, not play the tournament.

675
00:43:18,605 --> 00:43:20,779
He leads me to a brothel, and then says no girls.

676
00:43:21,438 --> 00:43:22,899
Why did not you say so?

677
00:43:23,647 --> 00:43:25,397
All of my work away!

678
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:29,147
I left my business to play your fault.

679
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:30,299
It's over.

680
00:43:31,313 --> 00:43:33,759
I thought if what you said was true,

681
00:43:34,147 --> 00:43:35,980
I could give my mother a better life.

682
00:43:37,063 --> 00:43:39,147
But it's not your fault.

683
00:43:41,647 --> 00:43:42,647
I'm a bastard.

684
00:43:43,272 --> 00:43:46,272
No. He's bad luck.

685
00:43:47,313 --> 00:43:49,739
Old Monk, we need half a million, right?

686
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,063
I got this.

687
00:44:00,313 --> 00:44:01,372
Let's go.

688
00:44:02,063 --> 00:44:03,105
Hello sir.

689
00:44:03,188 --> 00:44:04,647
- Hello. - Hello. Welcome.

690
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:05,605
- Kishan Lal. - Welcome.

691
00:44:05,688 --> 00:44:07,647
- And you? - I'm Priya, a pleasure, sir.

692
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:08,679
Welcome Sir.

693
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:10,063
- See you later. - Welcome Sir.

694
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,739
- Thank you. - Hello sir.

695
00:44:12,522 --> 00:44:14,239
How was the hotel?

696
00:44:14,563 --> 00:44:16,599
The flight. Is not it great?

697
00:44:17,022 --> 00:44:19,355
I think you've spent the money well, old.

698
00:44:19,438 --> 00:44:20,539
¿Viejo?

699
00:44:20,605 --> 00:44:21,813
How old uncle?

700
00:44:21,897 --> 00:44:23,438
You're a fucking pervert.

701
00:44:23,522 --> 00:44:25,522
Now you should think about the afterlife,

702
00:44:25,605 --> 00:44:27,647
- you think about girls. - Watch out!

703
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:30,139
Why we took a flight? We could have come by train.

704
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:32,063
And we could stay at a motel.

705
00:44:32,147 --> 00:44:34,813
- But then he could not tie. - Flirt?

706
00:44:34,897 --> 00:44:35,999
What are you talking about?

707
00:44:36,279 --> 00:44:37,980
Do not trust me?

708
00:44:38,063 --> 00:44:39,259
I do, but he did not.

709
00:44:39,355 --> 00:44:40,897
And I begin to distrust.

710
00:44:41,022 --> 00:44:44,188
Ali, first we must consider that half a million rupees.

711
00:44:44,259 --> 00:44:45,688
What he spent the money?

712
00:44:45,772 --> 00:44:47,939
It does not matter if you spent something on it.

713
00:44:48,105 --> 00:44:50,563
Let him enjoy a little before croak.

714
00:44:50,647 --> 00:44:51,522
You're right.

715
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,999
- What? ¿Croak? - That is...

716
00:44:54,105 --> 00:44:56,313
What do you say?

717
00:44:56,397 --> 00:44:58,105
Damn rascal!

718
00:44:58,188 --> 00:45:01,397
That's why I did not bring it here.

719
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,522
You want to do accounts?

720
00:45:02,605 --> 00:45:07,105
Voucher. Equipment, clothing, flight, travel, food.

721
00:45:07,188 --> 00:45:09,359
Tournament fee. All this adds half a million.

722
00:45:09,438 --> 00:45:10,959
Look how angry.

723
00:45:11,105 --> 00:45:13,659
- Just joking. - Go to hell!

724
00:45:14,688 --> 00:45:15,739
Let's go.

725
00:45:16,188 --> 00:45:17,313
Let's go. You old monk!

726
00:45:17,397 --> 00:45:18,688
- Do not talk to me. - Let's go.

727
00:45:18,772 --> 00:45:20,522
- Get lost. - Let's go.

728
00:45:21,147 --> 00:45:22,579

729
00:45:23,063 --> 00:45:24,605

730
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:26,279
Do not be so uncouth.

731
00:45:26,897 --> 00:45:28,230
I am your hostess Aditi.

00:45:30,772 --> 00:45:33,355
- And he is Ali, our golfero. - Golfero?

734
00:45:34,063 --> 00:45:35,772

735
00:45:35,855 --> 00:45:37,355

00:45:37,438 --> 00:45:39,259
Neha will take them to their rooms.

737
00:45:39,438 --> 00:45:40,647
Do not you coming with us?

738
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:42,522
Because I?

739
00:45:42,605 --> 00:45:43,999
What about that half a million ...?

740
00:45:44,355 --> 00:45:45,855
What did you spend it, then?

741
00:45:46,355 --> 00:45:49,147
Please complete the formalities at the reception.

742
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:51,359
Mr. Kishan Lal, ¿with me, please?

743
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:53,539
- Thank you. - Shut up. You'll kill us.

744
00:45:53,813 --> 00:45:55,938
Ali, here. Let's go.

745
00:45:59,522 --> 00:46:01,063
- Your name, sir. - Ali.

746
00:46:02,313 --> 00:46:03,347
Age?

747
00:46:04,438 --> 00:46:06,219
A year older than you.

748
00:46:06,313 --> 00:46:07,813
So it is 24.

749
00:46:07,897 --> 00:46:09,219
It does not seem to have 23.

750
00:46:10,063 --> 00:46:11,839
33 seem, so put 34.

751
00:46:12,605 --> 00:46:13,638
Sex?

752
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:18,605
I want, but my mom says no before I got married.

753
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,739
I stupid, man or woman?

754
00:46:22,605 --> 00:46:23,679
Woman?

755
00:46:23,813 --> 00:46:24,938
Is a man!

756
00:46:27,938 --> 00:46:28,999
What do I tell them?

757
00:47:05,897 --> 00:47:08,999
Boss, look what I have for you.

758
00:47:10,022 --> 00:47:11,813
- What is it? - It's a check.

759
00:47:11,897 --> 00:47:14,579
I know it's a check, but why did you bring?

760
00:47:14,938 --> 00:47:18,139
The guy says he has tax problems paying cash.

761
00:47:18,397 --> 00:47:21,147
So I brought ten checks 35 000 each.

762
00:47:21,355 --> 00:47:24,022
Tonto, have you gone to collect protection fees or INEM?

763
00:47:25,605 --> 00:47:27,147
First you brought the old east.

764
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:28,379
Now this check.

765
00:47:28,938 --> 00:47:30,459
Do you ever get cash?

766
00:47:31,522 --> 00:47:32,605
Danger head.

767
00:47:33,063 --> 00:47:34,719
Idiot, why you put Chief Risk?

768
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:37,579
Boss, not called Madhuri Dixit, right?

769
00:47:40,299 --> 00:47:44,059
Scoundrel, do not you know I'm chief danger to them?

770
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:46,139
My real name is Sohail Khan.

771
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:48,022
Yes, Salman's brother, of course.

772
00:47:48,105 --> 00:47:49,219
Silence.

773
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,980
What kind of people do I have?

774
00:47:51,397 --> 00:47:53,022
How do we charge this now?

775
00:47:53,105 --> 00:47:54,139
Very simple.

776
00:47:54,563 --> 00:47:57,647
First take a form. Enter your name, address and account number.

777
00:47:57,719 --> 00:47:59,199
And then entered the bank.

778
00:47:59,355 --> 00:48:01,022
With a 12% commission.

779
00:48:01,105 --> 00:48:03,688
0.5% for Clean India project.

780
00:48:03,855 --> 00:48:06,022
And 10.5% VAT.

781
00:48:06,105 --> 00:48:07,499
Damn dwarf...

782
00:48:07,563 --> 00:48:10,730
VAT not, crazy old man, you're a headache for me.

783
00:48:11,397 --> 00:48:12,759
Where did you get this old?

784
00:48:13,438 --> 00:48:16,699
Remember walnuts, almonds, Madhuri Dixit, Sohail Khan.

785
00:48:17,105 --> 00:48:19,419
But you do not remember your money or property.

786
00:48:21,063 --> 00:48:25,759
Hey, man, can you tell us why there are so many taxes?

787
00:48:26,147 --> 00:48:27,719
- Hey! - Forget this.

788
00:48:28,313 --> 00:48:29,599
That's the problem in India.

789
00:48:29,939 --> 00:48:32,522
too much money in taxes is spent and sex.

790
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:35,147
- More sex. - What?

791
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:36,272
Nothing, boss.

792
00:48:36,438 --> 00:48:37,772
What do you care?

793
00:48:37,938 --> 00:48:40,397
When you're with a girl you just wake up halfway.

794
00:48:41,522 --> 00:48:43,059
Shut!

795
00:48:44,813 --> 00:48:46,188
And if we call Maqsood?

796
00:48:46,397 --> 00:48:47,813
I'll try to call you, boss.

797
00:48:47,897 --> 00:48:49,188
Maqsood no contesta.

798
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,480
Hi. Sorry. I came to tell you

799
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:03,539
we have organized a meeting in the conference room.

800
00:49:03,605 --> 00:49:04,730
For players and staff.

801
00:49:04,813 --> 00:49:06,739
It would be fantastic to come.

802
00:49:06,939 --> 00:49:09,279
- Can I go too? - Clear.

803
00:49:09,605 --> 00:49:10,605
Why not?

804
00:49:13,272 --> 00:49:14,819
I see you later. Goodbye.

805
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:21,679
What you looking at, brother?

806
00:49:22,563 --> 00:49:23,563
Nothing.

807
00:49:29,147 --> 00:49:34,079
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, the Pro-rated Indian Golf 2016.

808
00:49:34,313 --> 00:49:36,772
More than 100 players from every corner of India

809
00:49:36,855 --> 00:49:38,759
They have come to be classified.

810
00:49:38,855 --> 00:49:41,839
But only the top 60 players can qualify today

811
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:44,039
and join the Pro Tour Indian.

812
00:49:44,522 --> 00:49:47,230
Good luck to all players. Enjoy the game.

813
00:49:47,688 --> 00:49:48,747
Thank my Lord.

814
00:49:49,063 --> 00:49:51,355
If I need something, I can call you?

815
00:49:51,438 --> 00:49:53,539
- Hey, pervert. - What happened?

816
00:49:54,022 --> 00:49:55,719
This site is full of rich.

817
00:49:56,272 --> 00:49:57,480
Do not show yourself how you are.

818
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,105
- Okay, let's cut to the chase. - Do not bother me.

819
00:50:00,188 --> 00:50:01,230
Would I come you with that?

820
00:50:01,647 --> 00:50:04,272
You go have fun and let me concentrate.

821
00:50:04,355 --> 00:50:05,779
- Do not bother me. - Ali.

822
00:50:08,063 --> 00:50:09,480
Hi.

823
00:50:13,438 --> 00:50:14,438
Good luck, Ali.

824
00:50:14,647 --> 00:50:18,299
Surely you clasificarás in the Top 60 today.

825
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:24,188
You trust me completely, and these doubts me.

826
00:50:26,605 --> 00:50:28,272
Good luck, Ali. Beware.

827
00:50:32,397 --> 00:50:34,230
- What? - What?

828
00:50:34,313 --> 00:50:36,980
If she talks, you feel cool, if I speak, we crashed.

829
00:50:37,063 --> 00:50:38,919
There is a difference between you and her.

830
00:50:39,188 --> 00:50:43,313
One can fall in love with Katrina Kaif, no Mohammad Kaif.

831
00:50:43,397 --> 00:50:44,897
And a Kaif as ugly as that!

832
00:50:45,063 --> 00:50:47,122
UNITECH GOLF EVENT CLASSIFICATION AND COUNTRY CLUB

833
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:06,722
Let's move on.

834
00:51:10,938 --> 00:51:12,072
FOUR HOLE

835
00:51:51,438 --> 00:51:53,938
Ali, this is the last hole.

836
00:51:54,397 --> 00:51:56,413
You must get the ball into the hole in four strokes.

837
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:58,480
Otherwise, you will not clasificarás.

838
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,188
Good luck.

839
00:52:00,272 --> 00:52:02,772
I made four sixes in four balls playing cricket.

840
00:52:02,855 --> 00:52:04,055
But I can not guarantee this.

841
00:52:37,313 --> 00:52:39,272
Ali, you have two more opportunities.

842
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,339
Do not worry. Be strong.

843
00:53:06,938 --> 00:53:09,119
Ali is a hill.

844
00:53:09,397 --> 00:53:11,313
If you give uphill, the ball enter.

845
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:12,499
Take this.

846
00:53:14,688 --> 00:53:15,605
Watch out.

847
00:53:15,688 --> 00:53:17,159
You should have given this before.

848
00:53:27,772 --> 00:53:30,522
Well done. I think Ali will qualify.

849
00:53:34,647 --> 00:53:37,730
With the grace of Allah, even a fool can.

850
00:54:03,313 --> 00:54:05,772
Yes!

851
00:54:07,397 --> 00:54:09,022
- What's up, man? - Get lost.

852
00:54:13,813 --> 00:54:16,188
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

853
00:54:24,688 --> 00:54:25,999
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,

Hello Beautiful.

00:54:30,355 --> 00:54:32,480
What's wrong? Are you sick?

857
00:54:32,688 --> 00:54:36,079
- No. Muslim. - OMG! Anyway!

858
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:38,839
You do not know Muslims?

859
00:54:39,063 --> 00:54:40,679
It will be given meat.

860
00:54:41,219 --> 00:54:43,813
I would like Vikram Singh Rathore call

861
00:54:43,897 --> 00:54:47,063

It is the main guest.

How is your mother now?

877
00:55:54,022 --> 00:55:55,019
It's better.

878
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:56,439
It is with me now.

879
00:55:58,439 --> 00:55:59,499
Or.

880
00:55:59,605 --> 00:56:01,730
That is the queen mother of Prince!

881
00:56:05,688 --> 00:56:06,855
Long live the Queen!

882
00:56:08,855 --> 00:56:10,522
- Can you relax, buddy? - Voucher.

883
00:56:10,605 --> 00:56:12,438
Quiet.

884
00:56:12,522 --> 00:56:14,019
But what happened to the queen?

885
00:56:14,563 --> 00:56:17,279
He has lost his memory by a blow to the head.

886
00:56:21,188 --> 00:56:23,719
If you ever find those two,

887
00:56:25,438 --> 00:56:29,539
the'd kick and would walk on a donkey.

888
00:56:29,938 --> 00:56:32,480

I cut them and behead members.

891
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:46,438
Why take your eyes, limbs and organs if beheads?

892
00:56:46,522 --> 00:56:47,855
What's your problem, pal?

893
00:56:47,938 --> 00:56:48,938
Calm down, okay.

894
00:56:49,022 --> 00:56:50,313

And that check you've given?

Who?

901
00:57:03,855 --> 00:57:06,105
Who gets to play golf today?

902
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:10,599
Goodbye, ma'am. Take care. Thank you.

903
00:57:11,355 --> 00:57:12,413
Let's ask him.

904
00:57:12,619 --> 00:57:13,559
Sorry.

905
00:57:13,647 --> 00:57:16,188
- Can we get that? - Of course.

906
00:57:16,272 --> 00:57:18,199

910
00:57:26,938 --> 00:57:28,022
And if you remember?

911
00:57:33,799 --> 00:57:34,999
It surprises me

912
00:57:35,605 --> 00:57:38,647
someone like you has become a professional golfer.

913
00:57:42,063 --> 00:57:43,139
I am surprised

914
00:57:44,022 --> 00:57:48,019
you're a champion, but not a good athlete.

915
00:57:48,147 --> 00:57:50,959
What? What nonsense you say?

916
00:57:51,772 --> 00:57:52,813
Do you know who I am?

917
00:57:53,605 --> 00:57:55,739
Do you know who is speaking to?

918
00:57:56,147 --> 00:57:57,659
I am the champion!

919
00:57:58,855 --> 00:58:00,938
Do not you think you should be playing cricket?

920
00:58:01,522 --> 00:58:02,813
¿Cricket?

921
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:04,813
You're always left over.

922
00:58:05,522 --> 00:58:06,980
Not well.

923
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,239
Where did you get that arrogance?

924
00:58:09,397 --> 00:58:11,059
Did you learn or were you born with it?

925
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,039
- Can you shut up? - Down pants.

926
00:58:15,063 --> 00:58:15,938
¿Down pants?

927
00:58:16,022 --> 00:58:17,647
I've wanted since childhood to

928
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:19,980
if someone sent me silence say "pants down".

929
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:21,799
And I have my wish. Enjoy the party.

930
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:24,688
- What you enjoy the party? - Yes.

931
00:58:25,313 --> 00:58:27,272
Let's enjoy the party.

932
00:58:28,647 --> 00:58:32,772
Ladies and gentlemen, a round of applause for Ali.

933
00:58:36,147 --> 00:58:39,919
A few days ago, he is selling underwear.

934
00:58:41,105 --> 00:58:43,759
And it is now qualified for the national tournament!

935
00:58:43,897 --> 00:58:44,930
Whoops!

936
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:46,097
An applause!

937
00:58:48,522 --> 00:58:51,938
If these poor lay their hands on a feast someday,

938
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:54,355
They believe they are the king.

939
00:58:54,855 --> 00:58:58,522
Vikram, what does the talent of being rich or poor?

940
00:58:59,099 --> 00:59:01,063
You're absolutely right, Megha.

941
00:59:01,397 --> 00:59:04,022
He qualified because he was lucky.

942
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:09,599
Fate favors who works hard.

943
00:59:10,063 --> 00:59:13,079
You you favor him more than the destination.

944
00:59:14,605 --> 00:59:15,759
Hereinafter,

945
00:59:16,859 --> 00:59:20,839
although bother you, I do not want anything old.

946
00:59:21,313 --> 00:59:22,272
Not even you.

947
00:59:22,355 --> 00:59:24,879
I'll hire the best managers in the world.

948
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,022
You are fired.

949
00:59:29,188 --> 00:59:30,247
And you...

950
00:59:31,259 --> 00:59:34,438
I never imagined that one day would compete.

951
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:38,147
But now I want that we face as soon as possible.

952
00:59:38,272 --> 00:59:40,105
And I will defeat such as fulminant,

953
00:59:41,139 --> 00:59:45,919
then not even be playing marbles.

954
00:59:46,397 --> 00:59:47,499
No matter.

955
00:59:48,438 --> 00:59:50,563
Even if I lose, I can do something else.

956
00:59:51,897 --> 00:59:53,339
What will you do if you lose?

957
00:59:54,855 --> 00:59:56,859
You can not not sell underwear.

958
00:59:58,647 --> 01:00:04,147
I will not sell even one, but I know how to break it.

959
01:00:05,147 --> 01:00:07,355
And I'll break both

960
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,855
you can not save your shame

961
01:00:10,938 --> 01:00:12,899
- nor your honor. - Do not!

962
01:00:13,355 --> 01:00:14,372
It is understood?

963
01:00:15,022 --> 01:00:17,679
I can destroy the pride of a mountain, you are!

964
01:00:18,899 --> 01:00:20,239
And as for winning and losing ...

965
01:00:22,813 --> 01:00:26,559
This is the beginning of your defeat and my victory.

966
01:00:31,522 --> 01:00:32,539
Can you count?

967
01:00:32,897 --> 01:00:34,559
- Countdown? - What?

968
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:36,739
Start learning.

969
01:00:45,463 --> 01:00:48,463
INTERVAL

970
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:56,272
I'll cut your kite today.

971
01:00:56,355 --> 01:00:59,105
- Loose. - That I do, dear.

972
01:00:59,188 --> 01:01:01,230
Aunt, look.

973
01:01:01,563 --> 01:01:02,719
Ali in the paper.

974
01:01:03,063 --> 01:01:06,099
- With a reward of 200,000 rupees. - What? ¿200,000?

975
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:11,313
They not even offered as a reward for the head of Gabbar Singh.

976
01:01:11,397 --> 01:01:12,438
God.

977
01:01:12,522 --> 01:01:14,759
No aunt. Read it well.

978
01:01:14,855 --> 01:01:18,139
Ali says that in a tournament won.

979
01:01:19,313 --> 01:01:20,399
In a match.

980
01:01:22,939 --> 01:01:24,899
Is there card tournaments?

981
01:01:25,272 --> 01:01:27,480
No card, of course.

982
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:28,859
With a ball.

983
01:01:29,147 --> 01:01:30,230
Ball!

984
01:01:30,313 --> 01:01:31,813
You see? Won.

985
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:32,959
Look. 200000.

986
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,688
Yes. Go.

987
01:01:34,772 --> 01:01:37,938
I always said that my son would win someday.

988
01:01:41,647 --> 01:01:43,259
- My son. - Ali!

989
01:01:48,188 --> 01:01:49,855
My son is here.

990
01:01:52,688 --> 01:01:56,272
Vikram would a party for each victory.

991
01:01:56,355 --> 01:01:58,022
For ricos, Megha.

992
01:01:58,105 --> 01:02:01,730
But look at these people dancing for your achievement, Ali.

993
01:02:01,813 --> 01:02:05,105
As if all you win.

994
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:06,355
They dance everywhere.

995
01:02:06,438 --> 01:02:08,039
They dance even if someone loses.

996
01:02:09,319 --> 01:02:11,022
All support you when you win.

997
01:02:11,105 --> 01:02:14,519
Megha, a fellow really is somebody who supports you when you lose.

998
01:02:20,355 --> 01:02:21,438
¡Sulb!

999
01:02:23,063 --> 01:02:27,239
Did not I provided my son Ali would do something big?

1000
01:02:30,499 --> 01:02:31,480
My son!

1001
01:02:31,563 --> 01:02:34,438
Stop saying "my son". He's my son.

1002
01:02:34,539 --> 01:02:37,355
Neither I say "my son" so many times.

1003
01:02:37,438 --> 01:02:38,522
Silence.

1004
01:02:39,022 --> 01:02:39,855
Mom.

1005
01:02:39,938 --> 01:02:41,022
You're very bad.

1006
01:02:41,859 --> 01:02:44,479
Look Mom. I won it for you.

1007
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,513
This is Megha.

1008
01:02:51,188 --> 01:02:53,855
- Also you won? - Arguably.

1009
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,605
- It's very cute. - Hello.

1010
01:02:57,688 --> 01:03:00,619
Megha, it is the local Romeo in our neighborhood.

1011
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:03,263
Romeo undead.

1012
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:04,730
Yes.

1013
01:03:04,813 --> 01:03:06,919
- Hello. - Stop.

1014
01:03:10,759 --> 01:03:13,105
- Ali, congratulations. - Thank you.

1015
01:03:13,188 --> 01:03:14,355
Congratulations, Ali.

1016
01:03:14,438 --> 01:03:15,688
- Congratulations, Ali. - Congratulations.

1017
01:03:15,772 --> 01:03:17,339
Congratulations. You played very well.

1018
01:03:17,438 --> 01:03:18,499
Congratulations.

1019
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,313
Look, your son has finally won.

1020
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:28,897
I asked you to open a door, but opened many.

1021
01:03:29,397 --> 01:03:31,339
When I opened the first door he rewarded me.

1022
01:03:31,522 --> 01:03:32,839
The second was no answer.

1023
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,719
Then fame. Then fortune and ...

1024
01:03:35,605 --> 01:03:36,738
Now a girl.

1025
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:39,539
Still working my gates, Lord.

1026
01:03:39,897 --> 01:03:42,605
And bless me with your grace. It is done.

1027
01:03:47,919 --> 01:03:49,772
- Do not push. - Give me space.

1028
01:03:54,313 --> 01:03:56,679
Chief, sell this junk and buy a new car,

1029
01:03:57,022 --> 01:03:58,813
if not, one day I burn.

1030
01:03:58,899 --> 01:04:01,563
Stupid, you are also useless. You should also burn?

1031
01:04:01,899 --> 01:04:05,980
Rogue, cheater, traitor!

1032
01:04:07,147 --> 01:04:08,188
Fraud.

1033
01:04:08,272 --> 01:04:10,647
Rascal, would I insult you?

1034
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:12,479
No, boss, do not insult.

1035
01:04:12,772 --> 01:04:13,805
Look.

1036
01:04:15,355 --> 01:04:16,438
Beautiful.

1037
01:04:17,399 --> 01:04:19,938
Chief greetings Fakru.

1038
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:22,605
Mercedes 250C.

1039
01:04:22,813 --> 01:04:24,539
136 hp power.

1040
01:04:25,897 --> 01:04:28,772
Four cylinders. 2299 cc.

1041
01:04:29,105 --> 01:04:30,679
5100 rpm.

1042
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:32,739
By 205 nm.

1043
01:04:33,855 --> 01:04:35,230
Made in Germany ...

1044
01:04:38,147 --> 01:04:41,022
Cursed Einstein, also know that.

1045
01:04:41,099 --> 01:04:42,605
But you do not know where your money.

1046
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:44,938
Leave it, boss. Look at Fakru.

1047
01:04:45,022 --> 01:04:47,179
- Did not I tell you it's a cheater? - I?

1048
01:04:47,272 --> 01:04:50,897
- Splurge your money. - You're right.

1049
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:52,022
And you in this carraca ...

1050
01:04:52,105 --> 01:04:56,438
Scoundrel, stop cause.

1051
01:04:57,813 --> 01:05:00,313
Chief, I have this car for you.

1052
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,639
Dhanpat refused to give money.

1053
01:05:04,063 --> 01:05:06,188
So I brought your car.

1054
01:05:06,772 --> 01:05:08,480
It's a Mercedes, boss. Worth a million.

1055
01:05:08,563 --> 01:05:10,313
Splendid, today you have made me happy.

1056
01:05:10,397 --> 01:05:11,430
Let's go.

1057
01:05:12,679 --> 01:05:14,688
- Do not come up. - Clear.

1058
01:05:14,772 --> 01:05:17,147
- Munna, burning the jeep. - Yes, I burn it!

1059
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:18,563
- From now on we will be in Mercedes. - Yes.

1060
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:20,399
- Let's Haji Ali. - Boss.

1061
01:05:21,022 --> 01:05:22,647
- There is a small problem. - What?

1062
01:05:22,739 --> 01:05:24,438
This car stops at times, like you.

1063
01:05:24,522 --> 01:05:26,059
Scoundrel, what is the problem?

1064
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:27,355
Nothing serious.

1065
01:05:28,147 --> 01:05:31,772
The deposit lost and repair costs 175 000 rupees.

1066
01:05:32,063 --> 01:05:34,313
The suspension does not work.

1067
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:37,063
Only 117,000 rupees.

1068
01:05:37,147 --> 01:05:38,279
And the engine is broken.

1069
01:05:38,522 --> 01:05:40,438
That will cost 350 000.

1070
01:05:41,355 --> 01:05:44,480
The carburetor is clogged. The fan does not work.

1071
01:05:44,813 --> 01:05:46,022
The brakes do not work.

1072
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:48,480
And I found the steering a little ...

1073
01:05:48,563 --> 01:05:49,647
What is the total cost?

1074
01:05:50,355 --> 01:05:51,272
Not much, boss.

1075
01:05:51,355 --> 01:05:53,779
In total, about 1.2 million.

1076
01:05:53,855 --> 01:05:56,522
Idiot, that car is worth a million and repair costs 1.2 million.

1077
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,480
- Yeah. - First you brought that old.

1078
01:05:58,563 --> 01:05:59,980
Then checks.

1079
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:01,959
And now this rusty scrap metal.

1080
01:06:02,022 --> 01:06:04,019
You had to bring 300,000 rupees that man.

1081
01:06:04,272 --> 01:06:05,397
You could not bring money?

1082
01:06:08,099 --> 01:06:10,855
- Munna, do not burn the car. - Do not burn yourself!

1083
01:06:10,938 --> 01:06:12,199
Boss, the jeep is already burning.

1084
01:06:13,063 --> 01:06:15,272
- dwarf Damn, get lost. - Chief, listen to me.

1085
01:06:15,772 --> 01:06:16,938
That guy was going to give me 300,000 rupees.

1086
01:06:17,022 --> 01:06:19,397
But I brought this car is worth a million.

1087
01:06:19,688 --> 01:06:21,105
It is a benefit of 700,000.

1088
01:06:21,188 --> 01:06:23,980
Benefit? I'll give you 700,000 kicks.

1089
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:25,230
Maqsood.

1090
01:06:25,313 --> 01:06:26,659
Who did you boss?

1091
01:06:27,813 --> 01:06:28,830
He fled.

1092
01:06:30,313 --> 01:06:31,388
Maqsood.

1093
01:06:31,772 --> 01:06:32,799
What happens there?

1094
01:06:33,063 --> 01:06:34,397
There are a bunch of idiots.

1095
01:06:35,063 --> 01:06:37,059
- Where were you? - In Bangalore.

1096
01:06:37,272 --> 01:06:38,188
¿Bangalore?

1097
01:06:38,272 --> 01:06:39,813
I understand that you had gone to Bangkok.

1098
01:06:39,897 --> 01:06:41,979
It is a place of interest. Why did you go to Bangalore?

1099
01:06:42,355 --> 01:06:43,879
Ali is pointing at golf.

1100
01:06:44,313 --> 01:06:45,579
He won the golf tournament.

1101
01:06:46,438 --> 01:06:47,719
You think you can fool me.

1102
01:06:48,105 --> 01:06:51,397
Is the neighborhood kid play marbles or golf?

1103
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:54,605
I knew you'd say that. Here, read this.

1104
01:06:56,355 --> 01:07:00,699
"For a virile strength, Meet Dr. Ashok.

1105
01:07:00,938 --> 01:07:03,299
Near the bus stop, Kandivali West. "

1106
01:07:03,397 --> 01:07:04,438
Not that.

1107
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:07,522
- This. - You could not say it before?

1108
01:07:07,605 --> 01:07:09,480
I started planning to go to Kandivali.

1109
01:07:10,859 --> 01:07:14,459
"Local boy wins Ali Golf Tournament.

1110
01:07:14,813 --> 01:07:17,272
It ranks in the Top 60. "

1111
01:07:17,688 --> 01:07:18,647
It is the picture of Ali.

1112
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:21,188
It's all written here, but I do not think so.

1113
01:07:21,459 --> 01:07:23,605
Do not you believe it? Play in Mumbai next week.

1114
01:07:23,688 --> 01:07:26,438
- See for yourself. - I go and see him myself.

1115
01:07:26,522 --> 01:07:29,563
But the Big Boss will not be happy. We are tightening.

1116
01:07:29,647 --> 01:07:31,397
- The big boss? - Yes.

1117
01:07:32,522 --> 01:07:34,579
Our business has fallen a lot extortion.

1118
01:07:34,647 --> 01:07:35,980
What do I tell them?

1119
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:38,605
Now our people are playing.

1120
01:07:38,772 --> 01:07:40,079
It will kill me.

1121
01:07:41,647 --> 01:07:43,355
Excuse me, sir. Can I become a selfie with you?

1122
01:07:43,438 --> 01:07:45,313
- Yeah sure. - Go.

1123
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:48,272
Thank my Lord.

1124
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:52,272
When people selfies ago, you're a star.

1125
01:07:53,105 --> 01:07:56,563
But in the old days, Dilip Kumar, Ashok Kumar, Rajesh Khanna,

1126
01:07:56,647 --> 01:07:58,730
How stars were made without selfies?

1127
01:07:59,688 --> 01:08:02,819
Ali, a selfie with me too. Please.

1128
01:08:04,855 --> 01:08:07,979
- Why do you call this unfortunate? - What miserable?

1129
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,379
He meant famous.

1130
01:08:11,522 --> 01:08:12,639
I'll be right back.

1131
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:14,399
Who?

1132
01:08:15,563 --> 01:08:17,180
Chief Risk is a dangerous gangster.

1133
01:08:17,188 --> 01:08:20,105
- Chief, how are you? - It is too high.

1134
01:08:21,313 --> 01:08:22,522
What do you care?

1135
01:08:23,355 --> 01:08:25,398
The boss is very close to God.

1136
01:08:25,772 --> 01:08:28,378
When we die, we will go to heaven.

1137
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:31,188
But the boss will not rise much.

1138
01:08:31,272 --> 01:08:32,818
- Right, boss? - Shut.

1139
01:08:33,147 --> 01:08:35,258
- You will start the game. - they Have released the coin?

1140
01:08:35,522 --> 01:08:37,605
Sir, this is not a game of cricket.

1141
01:08:37,688 --> 01:08:38,813
This is golf.

1142
01:08:38,897 --> 01:08:40,458
No coin is tossed.

1143
01:08:40,558 --> 01:08:43,105
You see? So he does all of golf.

1144
01:08:43,563 --> 01:08:45,998
Damn old, why do not you tell us

1145
01:08:46,188 --> 01:08:47,578
Why is the earth round?

1146
01:08:48,105 --> 01:08:50,458
Or why February has only 28 days?

1147
01:08:50,772 --> 01:08:53,438
And in old movies, why the ghost leaves

1148
01:08:53,522 --> 01:08:54,918
only when the heroines bathe?

1149
01:08:56,105 --> 01:08:59,272
And tell me, why children are born nine months?

1150
01:09:00,313 --> 01:09:02,378
- By sex! - Is going to kill me.

1151
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,147
The match is about to begin.

1152
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:05,563
Come on. Dwarf.

1153
01:09:18,318 --> 01:09:19,498
What does?

1154
01:09:23,105 --> 01:09:24,522
Called the Big Boss.

1155
01:09:25,647 --> 01:09:26,647
Say, boss.

1156
01:09:27,355 --> 01:09:28,355
Say it!

1157
01:09:28,938 --> 01:09:31,018
Say! I think there is no coverage.

1158
01:09:31,355 --> 01:09:34,147
Well, get up, you're like a tower.

1159
01:09:35,605 --> 01:09:36,622
Say it?

1160
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:38,258
Yes Boss?

1161
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:43,805
Okay, boss.

1162
01:09:58,878 --> 01:10:01,688

Superb!

1171
01:14:15,355 --> 01:14:16,372
Yes Boss.

1172
01:14:22,188 --> 01:14:23,188
I've lost again.

1173
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:25,118
The Queen is not my destiny.

1174
01:14:26,438 --> 01:14:28,478
Boss, your 2500 rupees.

1175
01:14:29,605 --> 01:14:30,658
Subo 2500 rupees.

1176
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,355
- What is this? - Losing.

1177
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:34,918
What kind of joke is this?

1178
01:14:35,105 --> 01:14:36,778
Who pays for losing?

1179
01:14:37,078 --> 01:14:38,378
What if someone does?

1180
01:14:38,938 --> 01:14:40,438
Why would anyone want to win?

1181
01:14:40,688 --> 01:14:41,798
Clear.

1182
01:14:42,838 --> 01:14:45,938
Ali has won every tournament.

1183
01:14:46,658 --> 01:14:48,698
- It has become a champion. - Y?

1184
01:14:48,938 --> 01:14:52,218
Everyone thinks it will also win the next championship.

1185
01:14:52,558 --> 01:14:54,647
What will they think? Ali will win.

1186
01:14:54,838 --> 01:14:56,813
It's what I'm trying to say.

1187
01:14:58,278 --> 01:15:00,230
All bet on the victory of Ali.

1188
01:15:01,658 --> 01:15:04,738
But we bet to lose.

1189
01:15:05,772 --> 01:15:06,805
Bet?

1190
01:15:08,158 --> 01:15:09,678
If we win this bet, Maqsood,

1191
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:11,038
you earn millions.

1192
01:15:12,105 --> 01:15:13,138
Millions!

1193
01:15:16,478 --> 01:15:17,980
DAY 1

1194
01:15:18,188 --> 01:15:22,658
Vikram, I think the tournament this year will be tough.

1195
01:15:23,188 --> 01:15:24,238
Clear.

1196
01:15:24,438 --> 01:15:27,438
But for the rest, not for me.

1197
01:15:28,313 --> 01:15:31,563
None of the players can challenge Vikram.

1198
01:15:31,647 --> 01:15:35,158
And Ali, who has played very well on an ongoing basis?

1199
01:15:35,438 --> 01:15:39,313
Nobody, and I mean nobody can beat me if I am not myself!

1200
01:15:40,538 --> 01:15:43,938
As every year, the tournament will win me.

1201
01:15:44,647 --> 01:15:45,938
Not just anybody.

1202
01:15:46,022 --> 01:15:47,105
Hello, Ali.

1203
01:15:48,647 --> 01:15:49,680
Any one?

1204
01:15:50,313 --> 01:15:55,230
Ali, Vikram says this year will also win.

1205
01:15:55,318 --> 01:15:56,398
He has not said anything wrong.

1206
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:01,855
Someone who has won five years in a row,

1207
01:16:01,938 --> 01:16:04,147
How you can lose this year? He is a born winner.

1208
01:16:04,230 --> 01:16:08,638
In fact, you should be called Vikram 'Victor' Rathore. He is a champion.

1209
01:16:08,855 --> 01:16:10,522
All players have come

1210
01:16:11,313 --> 01:16:12,918
to lose against him.

1211
01:16:13,230 --> 01:16:16,698
In fact, they should cancel these tournaments.

1212
01:16:17,188 --> 01:16:19,998
And send the trophies of the next two years at home.

1213
01:16:21,272 --> 01:16:23,178
How can you say you lost?

1214
01:16:24,105 --> 01:16:26,038
Imagine that lost.

1215
01:16:26,647 --> 01:16:28,058
What's the worst that can happen?

1216
01:16:28,605 --> 01:16:31,438
He would be humiliated. Lose their dignity.

1217
01:16:31,605 --> 01:16:32,830
But would still handsome.

1218
01:16:32,938 --> 01:16:34,758
Her face is pretty, it could be a model.

1219
01:16:35,022 --> 01:16:37,480
I do not know if I could make movies, because it is more difficult.

1220
01:16:37,563 --> 01:16:39,558
Or maybe you can make music videos.

1221
01:16:40,022 --> 01:16:41,397
Class B music videos

1222
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,022
At least it would not be humiliated.

1223
01:16:45,272 --> 01:16:46,978
Even if you suffer some humiliation,

1224
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:49,818
He lives in a palace.

1225
01:16:50,397 --> 01:16:53,563
Imagine that you kicked out of his palace.

1226
01:16:53,647 --> 01:16:55,022
And it stays on the street.

1227
01:16:56,272 --> 01:16:58,855
You will find any one like me there

1228
01:16:58,938 --> 01:17:00,958
and if you ask

1229
01:17:01,647 --> 01:17:04,105
"What are you doing here?", What are you going to tell?

1230
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,258
So the conclusion is

1231
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:11,063
you have a lot to lose and I have nothing.

1232
01:17:11,147 --> 01:17:12,218
Long live the prince.

1233
01:17:13,105 --> 01:17:15,397
- Never mind, dear. - Shut!

1234
01:17:16,063 --> 01:17:17,298
Down pants!

1235
01:17:20,355 --> 01:17:23,138
It is real? What are you doing here? Get lost!

1236
01:17:23,313 --> 01:17:24,572
GROUP A

1237
01:18:04,098 --> 01:18:05,678
Hole 3

1238
01:18:09,638 --> 01:18:10,878
HOLE PAR

1239
01:18:43,578 --> 01:18:44,738
GROUP A - HOLE 18

1240
01:18:46,898 --> 01:18:48,298
GROUP B - HOLE 18

1241
01:19:29,355 --> 01:19:32,298
I heard a story of a child.

1242
01:19:33,022 --> 01:19:35,698
About a king whose life was trapped in the body of a parrot.

1243
01:19:36,818 --> 01:19:39,855
Ali is king and Kishan Lal is the parrot.

1244
01:19:40,772 --> 01:19:43,730
Cages Kishan Lal, and the king's yours.

1245
01:19:56,278 --> 01:19:59,018
Maqsood, why did you bring me here?

1246
01:19:59,772 --> 01:20:03,188
Look, Kishan Lal, inside you will find some girls.

1247
01:20:03,272 --> 01:20:04,980
Geez, what are you talking about?

1248
01:20:05,063 --> 01:20:06,398
I'm not that kind of man.

1249
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,647
You're 60 years old and still single.

1250
01:20:10,313 --> 01:20:12,018
Every man has needs.

1251
01:20:12,522 --> 01:20:14,688
You want to be a caddy all your life?

1252
01:20:14,772 --> 01:20:16,918
- Do not you want to be a daddy? - Do not.

1253
01:20:17,355 --> 01:20:19,980
- I'm a decent guy. - A boy?

1254
01:20:20,188 --> 01:20:23,730
You were a kid when Aamir Khan wearing jeans high shot.

1255
01:20:23,813 --> 01:20:26,878
You know what the midwife said when you were born?

1256
01:20:27,272 --> 01:20:29,798
"Dear, is a great guy."

1257
01:20:30,813 --> 01:20:32,818
I'm panicking.

1258
01:20:33,188 --> 01:20:34,958
- You follow me play. - Voucher.

1259
01:20:35,022 --> 01:20:36,647
Look for more men.

1260
01:20:36,730 --> 01:20:39,980
We go to a musical meeting, okay? Enters. Let's go!

1261
01:20:40,272 --> 01:20:41,855
Go ahead, boy.

1262
01:20:41,938 --> 01:20:43,313
- Do you believe? - Come on.

1263
01:20:43,397 --> 01:20:44,413
Let's go.

1264
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:46,038
And.

1265
01:20:57,578 --> 01:20:59,558
DAY 2

1266
01:21:11,638 --> 01:21:13,978
The game is about to start Kishan Lal has not arrived.

1267
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:16,522
- And do not answer the phone. - There will have an accident.

1268
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:18,258
What do you say? It's my caddy.

1269
01:21:18,688 --> 01:21:20,178
How do I'll play the tournament without him?

1270
01:21:20,355 --> 01:21:22,230
Do not worry. I'm here.

1271
01:21:22,313 --> 01:21:23,598
I'll be your caddy.

1272
01:21:24,313 --> 01:21:27,598
This is golf, not a putiferio, where a girl replaces another.

1273
01:21:28,105 --> 01:21:29,198
"Yo seré tu caddy".

1274
01:21:29,898 --> 01:21:32,878
This is a great tournament and Kishan Lal should be here.

1275
01:21:33,522 --> 01:21:34,772
What was that old?

1276
01:21:35,022 --> 01:21:36,458
Carry your stuff.

1277
01:21:37,272 --> 01:21:38,605
Not just his stuff.

1278
01:21:38,688 --> 01:21:42,522
I knew what club to use what and when to throw.

1279
01:21:42,605 --> 01:21:45,198
I also chose some things. I will replace you.

1280
01:21:46,147 --> 01:21:48,147
I think we should wait.

1281
01:21:48,230 --> 01:21:49,938
We delay it if you hope.

1282
01:21:50,022 --> 01:21:51,272
As the saying goes:

1283
01:21:51,355 --> 01:21:52,897
"Something much better ..."

1284
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:54,188
"Something something..."

1285
01:21:54,272 --> 01:21:56,458
- "Less gives a stone." - That.

1286
01:22:03,778 --> 01:22:04,978
HOLE PAR 1

1287
01:22:08,105 --> 01:22:09,163
Good shot.

1288
01:22:13,678 --> 01:22:15,813
- Wait. - Take this.

1289
01:22:16,397 --> 01:22:18,188
This stick is not good for this shot.

1290
01:22:21,147 --> 01:22:22,605
- This stick ... - Is this.

1291
01:22:37,078 --> 01:22:38,838
- Why have you given me this? - It's good.

1292
01:22:43,563 --> 01:22:44,897
You should have known that.

1293
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:47,818
That was good too. This is good.

1294
01:22:48,147 --> 01:22:49,180
Let's go.

1295
01:23:10,578 --> 01:23:11,698
You're confusing me.

1296
01:23:11,772 --> 01:23:13,078
- Is not that ... - is this.

1297
01:23:13,147 --> 01:23:15,418
- Is this not confuse me. - right, forward.

1298
01:23:20,978 --> 01:23:22,480
You've unfocused.

1299
01:23:22,563 --> 01:23:23,980
See where the ball goes.

1300
01:23:24,063 --> 01:23:25,313
I told you this stick ...

1301
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:35,638
Play Well.

1302
01:23:35,897 --> 01:23:36,978
Shut.

1303
01:23:38,397 --> 01:23:41,063
- Play well, Ali. - Shut!

1304
01:23:55,813 --> 01:23:57,938
What will happen today. Look how he plays.

1305
01:24:23,147 --> 01:24:24,158
Maqsood.

1306
01:24:25,230 --> 01:24:27,698
The game is very wrong. Let's play it safe.

1307
01:24:28,688 --> 01:24:29,688
Give me the iron.

1308
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:31,258
Ali, no mistake.

1309
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,855
Focus on your game.

1310
01:24:35,188 --> 01:24:36,397
- Insurance? - Clear.

1311
01:24:39,230 --> 01:24:40,298
Give me the driver.

1312
01:24:42,730 --> 01:24:43,763
Ten.

1313
01:25:00,605 --> 01:25:01,998
I can not concentrate.

1314
01:25:04,105 --> 01:25:05,938
Why do you smile? Let's go.

1315
01:26:17,730 --> 01:26:21,605
Maqsood, I know what you're doing.

1316
01:26:21,688 --> 01:26:24,647
I do my job, and you should make yours. It is understood?

1317
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:45,397
I told Ali to stay away from Maqsood.

1318
01:26:47,813 --> 01:26:52,598
But now he told you to stay away from my son.

1319
01:26:54,813 --> 01:26:56,022
Why did you do it, Maqsood?

1320
01:26:58,438 --> 01:27:01,397
Because I want to make money, not being a champion like you.

1321
01:27:02,188 --> 01:27:05,563
What do you get winning? A trophy and some money?

1322
01:27:05,798 --> 01:27:08,022
Your picture in the paper? And me?

1323
01:27:08,313 --> 01:27:10,980
How can you forget that play because of me?

1324
01:27:11,063 --> 01:27:13,818
Kishan Lal and you would have lost hope.

1325
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:16,272
I went to Chief Risk for help.

1326
01:27:17,147 --> 01:27:18,897
Mom, I was with your son

1327
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:22,522
when she was sad and crying, not her!

1328
01:27:23,938 --> 01:27:27,313
I was with him when selling underwear in the sun, not her!

1329
01:27:28,438 --> 01:27:31,397
I defended him when the boys teased him!

1330
01:27:32,605 --> 01:27:35,355
Mom, not all poor people have the opportunity to become rich.

1331
01:27:35,438 --> 01:27:37,563
Today we have the opportunity to earn money!

1332
01:27:37,678 --> 01:27:40,147
- to lead a good life. - What a good life?

1333
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:44,522
Do you know the difference between a good life and an honest life?

1334
01:27:46,278 --> 01:27:47,878
Come with me. Come!

1335
01:27:53,355 --> 01:27:54,430
Look!

1336
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:00,038
¡Do!

1337
01:28:01,147 --> 01:28:02,938
I made a tournament in your name.

1338
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:05,272
You have to come. Next Sunday.

1339
01:28:05,355 --> 01:28:07,063
You'll be ... how do you say?

1340
01:28:07,147 --> 01:28:08,355
- Chief Guest. - Chief Guest.

1341
01:28:08,438 --> 01:28:09,478
You must come, brother.

1342
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:12,778
Did you hear that?

1343
01:28:13,158 --> 01:28:15,678
Money does not buy everything, Maqsood.

1344
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:18,022
You can buy comfort and luxury with money.

1345
01:28:18,105 --> 01:28:19,772
But love and respect.

1346
01:28:21,897 --> 01:28:26,438
Ali achieved something that no one could imagine.

1347
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:31,598
He has given them hope.

1348
01:28:32,147 --> 01:28:33,218
¡Do!

1349
01:28:34,522 --> 01:28:38,105
You can not imagine what it did to me!

1350
01:28:39,397 --> 01:28:40,938
But where were you, man?

1351
01:28:41,238 --> 01:28:43,272
Where it should not be.

1352
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:45,838
- In jail! - In jail?

1353
01:28:46,230 --> 01:28:50,230
This man will do anything for their benefit. Whatever is!

1354
01:28:50,313 --> 01:28:53,938
It has tarnished my reputation, Ali.

1355
01:28:54,147 --> 01:28:56,188
Now I can not look anyone in the face.

1356
01:28:56,730 --> 01:29:00,022
It's a selfish, Ali!

1357
01:29:00,147 --> 01:29:01,163
A selfish!

1358
01:29:08,647 --> 01:29:10,813
I knew that one day do something big,

1359
01:29:12,230 --> 01:29:16,230
but I never thought I'd fall so low.

1360
01:29:18,063 --> 01:29:19,105
Come on, mom.

1361
01:29:32,305 --> 01:29:33,378
DAY 3

1362
01:29:35,138 --> 01:29:36,338
GROUP A

1363
01:29:39,305 --> 01:29:40,438
B GROUP

1364
01:29:47,438 --> 01:29:49,358
ALI - Hole 12

1365
01:29:51,038 --> 01:29:52,138
RATHORE - HOYO 12

1366
01:30:22,022 --> 01:30:23,063
Yes!

1367
01:30:26,897 --> 01:30:27,972
Yes!

1368
01:30:49,438 --> 01:30:50,813
Ali, listen to me.

1369
01:30:52,230 --> 01:30:53,605
It is the third day.

1370
01:30:53,813 --> 01:30:55,230
The first gave in the bushes.

1371
01:30:55,313 --> 01:30:56,730
The second, in the water.

1372
01:30:56,813 --> 01:30:58,098
Today it safe.

1373
01:30:58,397 --> 01:31:02,258
Dale left the tree on the street. It is understood?

1374
01:31:37,058 --> 01:31:38,138
Well played, Ali.

1375
01:31:38,897 --> 01:31:40,578
¿Praise Me? Go.

1376
01:31:41,313 --> 01:31:44,878
Has anyone ever written to you the text or happened to you alone?

1377
01:31:45,147 --> 01:31:46,618
Ali, I am a sportsman.

1378
01:31:46,813 --> 01:31:50,688
And I know that an athlete should respect another.

1379
01:31:50,772 --> 01:31:51,772
Y?

1380
01:31:52,397 --> 01:31:54,647
- We had a drink tonight? - A glass?

1381
01:31:55,397 --> 01:31:57,018
- Tomorrow is the end. - Yes.

1382
01:31:57,647 --> 01:31:59,718
And if drug in the drink?

1383
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:01,738
Why should he?

1384
01:32:02,397 --> 01:32:03,798
I am talking about myself.

1385
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:07,105
See you later.

1386
01:32:09,355 --> 01:32:10,458
Maqsood,

1387
01:32:10,897 --> 01:32:13,498
Grand Chief has bet a lot of money for the loss of Ali.

1388
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:15,918
Let them understand tonight.

1389
01:32:17,230 --> 01:32:20,438
Otherwise, my men will explain it very well.

1390
01:32:20,605 --> 01:32:21,605
I will understand it.

1391
01:32:34,563 --> 01:32:38,855
A person who offers alcohol is good people.

1392
01:32:40,688 --> 01:32:43,178
But someone who gets you drunk ...

1393
01:32:51,230 --> 01:32:52,618
You lose.

1394
01:32:53,647 --> 01:32:56,938
Whoever wins the championship,

1395
01:32:58,355 --> 01:32:59,688
it does not matter.

1396
01:33:00,105 --> 01:33:03,897
Our friendship will remain intact.

1397
01:33:03,980 --> 01:33:05,678
From now on, we're friends.

1398
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:09,055
Health.

1399
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:14,288
Vikram.

1400
01:33:17,063 --> 01:33:18,158
You're my friend.

1401
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:19,818
I'm serious.

1402
01:33:20,147 --> 01:33:22,198
Remember how I said that

1403
01:33:22,647 --> 01:33:25,838
whoever wins the championship

1404
01:33:26,718 --> 01:33:28,278
it does not matter? Did not I tell you?

1405
01:33:28,522 --> 01:33:30,818
- Yeah. - Well, I'll win the championship.

1406
01:33:31,897 --> 01:33:36,897
Look, brother. I was the champion in the last five years.

1407
01:33:37,647 --> 01:33:41,980
I want to be six times in a row and beat my own record.

1408
01:33:42,647 --> 01:33:47,938
But your destiny is in your hands

1409
01:33:48,898 --> 01:33:52,272
and mine in mine.

1410
01:33:53,278 --> 01:33:54,518
You're right, my friend.

1411
01:33:55,313 --> 01:34:00,188
Tomorrow we will know who favors your destination

1412
01:34:00,438 --> 01:34:01,458
and whose hand ...

1413
01:34:14,355 --> 01:34:15,413
Bring the car!

1414
01:34:32,230 --> 01:34:33,897
Try moving your finger.

1415
01:34:44,647 --> 01:34:45,898
Okay, relax.

1416
01:34:55,188 --> 01:34:57,438
Aunt, has very injured hand.

1417
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,838
- You can not play tomorrow. - No, tomorrow will play.

1418
01:35:04,063 --> 01:35:05,188
It's hard.

1419
01:35:06,522 --> 01:35:07,647
Of course he plays.

1420
01:35:09,063 --> 01:35:11,188
For my son it has not been easy to get here.

1421
01:35:15,318 --> 01:35:17,105
If you do not play tomorrow,

1422
01:35:19,063 --> 01:35:22,147
You will miss you, God, not Ali.

1423
01:35:25,105 --> 01:35:27,178
He will play.

1424
01:35:40,355 --> 01:35:46,313
Some seek God in mosques

1425
01:35:54,355 --> 01:35:59,938
Others seek God in temples

1426
01:36:05,688 --> 01:36:11,647
Whose name invokes the world

1427
01:36:15,897 --> 01:36:21,772
Mora here in my heart

1428
01:36:33,397 --> 01:36:37,355
Oh bless me with Your grace you benevolent

1429
01:36:37,438 --> 01:36:41,355
Oh bless me with Your grace you benevolent

1430
01:36:41,438 --> 01:36:45,647
¡Oh benevolent tú! ¡Oh benevolent tú!

1431
01:36:47,397 --> 01:36:51,230
¡Oh benevolent tú! ¡Oh benevolent tú!

1432
01:36:51,355 --> 01:36:55,230
I invoke you with open arms

1433
01:36:55,355 --> 01:36:59,397
Oh bless me with Your grace you benevolent

1434
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:03,563
Oh bless me with Your grace you benevolent

1435
01:37:23,897 --> 01:37:25,855
You are the peace that dwells in our hearts

1436
01:37:25,938 --> 01:37:27,772
You're the one who blesses us with grace

1437
01:37:27,897 --> 01:37:29,772
I come seeking your refuge

1438
01:37:29,855 --> 01:37:31,730
I hope your grace

1439
01:37:31,897 --> 01:37:33,855
Before you bless us before we ask

1440
01:37:33,938 --> 01:37:35,855
Solve all our problems

1441
01:37:35,938 --> 01:37:37,772
You're the benefactor of this world

1442
01:37:37,897 --> 01:37:40,938
I am poor and you have it all

1443
01:37:43,272 --> 01:37:44,688
It's you

1444
01:37:45,272 --> 01:37:50,397
It's you

1445
01:37:51,438 --> 01:37:55,272
Oh bless me with Your grace you benevolent

1446
01:37:55,355 --> 01:37:59,272
Oh bless me with Your grace you benevolent

1447
01:37:59,397 --> 01:38:03,438
Oh bless me with Your grace you benevolent

1448
01:38:07,563 --> 01:38:09,355
You are law, fair

1449
01:38:09,438 --> 01:38:11,772
You are the beating heart

1450
01:38:13,188 --> 01:38:15,022
Be quiet or restless heart

1451
01:38:15,147 --> 01:38:17,063
You're all pain relief

1452
01:38:18,958 --> 01:38:20,647
My aching heart calls you

1453
01:38:20,730 --> 01:38:22,605
You are my friend, my companion

1454
01:38:22,698 --> 01:38:25,938
Sir

1455
01:38:26,355 --> 01:38:29,688
You are the vast blue sky I walk below

1456
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:36,980
Oh bless me with Your grace you benevolent

1457
01:38:37,105 --> 01:38:40,688
Oh bless me with Your grace you benevolent

1458
01:38:40,978 --> 01:38:44,558
Oh bless me with Your grace you benevolent

1459
01:38:44,818 --> 01:38:49,438
Oh bless me with Your grace you benevolent

1460
01:38:51,398 --> 01:38:53,598
DAY 4 - FINAL DAY

1461
01:38:53,730 --> 01:38:55,230
Last call for Ali.

1462
01:38:55,313 --> 01:38:57,438
If you do not leave the field in 10 minutes,

1463
01:38:57,563 --> 01:38:59,772
You will be disqualified from the tournament.

1464
01:39:03,647 --> 01:39:06,018
Begins the countdown of my victory.

1465
01:39:16,813 --> 01:39:18,022
Congratulations on your victory!

1466
01:39:21,063 --> 01:39:24,313
You can break someone's hand, but do not give me mine.

1467
01:39:25,397 --> 01:39:26,397
What do you mean?

1468
01:39:27,688 --> 01:39:29,313
I wanted to do what you do.

1469
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:34,438
You want to win this tournament and I want Ali lost.

1470
01:39:35,188 --> 01:39:36,813
Maqsood did not help.

1471
01:39:37,605 --> 01:39:39,772
But your motive suited us well.

1472
01:39:45,397 --> 01:39:46,455
Just a moment.

1473
01:39:50,038 --> 01:39:54,688
No matter you want bad people, your fate is in God's hands alone.

1474
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:37,038
Your desires can not be greater than the will of God.

1475
01:40:38,980 --> 01:40:40,038
And you,

1476
01:40:41,318 --> 01:40:44,230
You can break Ali's hand, but not his courage.

1477
01:40:48,018 --> 01:40:51,218
Maqsood, today you are the caddy.

1478
01:40:51,563 --> 01:40:53,058
You've learned enough.

1479
01:40:53,522 --> 01:40:55,338
Sto this. Ahead.

1480
01:41:03,798 --> 01:41:04,838
HOLE 1

1481
01:42:00,813 --> 01:42:02,397
Here, take this.

1482
01:42:04,522 --> 01:42:05,563
What's happening here?

1483
01:42:18,063 --> 01:42:20,563
Ten. Good luck, Ali!

1484
01:42:25,105 --> 01:42:26,180
To play.

1485
01:44:19,258 --> 01:44:21,158
VIKRAM RATHORE 4 - ALI 4 IGUALES

1486
01:44:55,098 --> 01:44:56,878
Great Leader is making a grand entrance!

1487
01:45:04,638 --> 01:45:06,338
- Big Boss has style. - True.

1488
01:45:06,438 --> 01:45:07,938
No, you have piles.

1489
01:45:08,022 --> 01:45:08,980
What do you say?

1490
01:45:09,063 --> 01:45:10,272
You can not sit.

1491
01:45:15,563 --> 01:45:17,647
- Who? - I do not know.

1492
01:45:18,313 --> 01:45:19,688
What is he doing here?

1493
01:45:27,605 --> 01:45:28,663
Boss!

1494
01:45:29,897 --> 01:45:31,818
- Chief, are you okay? - Yes.

1495
01:45:31,938 --> 01:45:33,998
- Has anyone seen him? - No, boss.

1496
01:45:35,438 --> 01:45:36,522
What happens?

1497
01:45:36,618 --> 01:45:38,522
Am I you're dusting or shaking?

1498
01:45:38,605 --> 01:45:40,188
- Dusting, boss. - It's okay?

1499
01:45:40,498 --> 01:45:43,498
I riots parts, otherwise fine.

1500
01:45:45,938 --> 01:45:48,230
I'm surprised to see you here. We did not tell.

1501
01:45:48,318 --> 01:45:53,078
Earthquake, tsunami and the Big Boss come without warning.

1502
01:45:54,018 --> 01:45:57,188
- What do you do? - It was not a joke, midget.

1503
01:45:57,478 --> 01:45:59,855
It is the end, and I wanted to see her in person.

1504
01:46:00,355 --> 01:46:01,558
You have done well, boss.

1505
01:46:02,605 --> 01:46:04,218
The Big Boss is always right.

1506
01:46:05,147 --> 01:46:06,938
But I hope that Ali did not go well today.

1507
01:46:07,272 --> 01:46:10,098
Make room in the Dubai store to save money.

1508
01:46:10,272 --> 01:46:12,313
I doubt you can play, winning is out of the question.

1509
01:46:12,378 --> 01:46:14,147
- Fakru, tell them. - Yes Boss.

1510
01:46:14,522 --> 01:46:15,980
- Ali is finished. - What?

1511
01:46:16,063 --> 01:46:17,097
Exact.

1512
01:46:55,855 --> 01:46:56,730
What happened?

1513
01:46:56,813 --> 01:46:58,938
It applauded because it was a bad shot.

1514
01:46:59,018 --> 01:47:01,897
Why do you confuse whether it was a bad shot?

1515
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:03,397
Not you, boss. For him.

1516
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:04,538
Phone.

1517
01:47:05,418 --> 01:47:07,178
- What? - No, do you think you would do that?

1518
01:47:08,522 --> 01:47:09,998
Site.

1519
01:47:23,563 --> 01:47:25,598
Hazlo.

1520
01:47:26,605 --> 01:47:27,658
What happens?

1521
01:47:27,772 --> 01:47:29,958
- Look there, boss. - Where?

1522
01:47:58,855 --> 01:48:00,118
Stop it, boss.

1523
01:48:01,313 --> 01:48:02,347
Yes!

1524
01:48:12,730 --> 01:48:14,980
- But what ... - Do not be scared, boss.

1525
01:48:16,538 --> 01:48:18,998
They start playing when playing Ali.

1526
01:48:19,158 --> 01:48:21,378
But he takes this shot stuck in the past three days.

1527
01:48:21,647 --> 01:48:22,938
Surely you lose.

1528
01:48:24,178 --> 01:48:26,638
That's why I've upped the ante to two million dirhams.

1529
01:48:27,147 --> 01:48:29,022
- You know how much is that? - Yes Boss.

1530
01:48:29,105 --> 01:48:34,772
Two million multiplied by 19.75 means 30.95 crore.

1531
01:48:34,855 --> 01:48:37,358
A 62 rupees a dollar.

1532
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:43,938
It means that two million dirhams is $ 607,096.

1533
01:48:44,022 --> 01:48:46,063
In the euro ...

1534
01:48:46,647 --> 01:48:48,272
Who is this old calculator?

1535
01:48:48,355 --> 01:48:49,358
Boss, he is ...

1536
01:48:50,358 --> 01:48:52,418
Chief, consider another Ali.

1537
01:48:52,688 --> 01:48:54,147
We have opted for it.

1538
01:48:55,813 --> 01:48:58,813
Danger, you know I do not like losses in business.

1539
01:48:58,897 --> 01:48:59,855
Neither do we.

1540
01:48:59,938 --> 01:49:03,022
- What did you say, midget? - Nothing, boss.

1541
01:49:04,563 --> 01:49:07,105
Ali loss is our victory.

1542
01:49:07,688 --> 01:49:08,763
It is understood?

1543
01:49:10,147 --> 01:49:12,418
Is this the ali lose that tell you?

1544
01:49:12,838 --> 01:49:15,188
Aunt, he is the big boss. Show respect.

1545
01:49:15,355 --> 01:49:18,355
Big boss? It does not behave as one.

1546
01:49:18,438 --> 01:49:20,938
- Aunt! - Listen to me.

1547
01:49:21,038 --> 01:49:23,897
- Aunt! - My son will not lose.

1548
01:49:23,980 --> 01:49:25,230
- Aunt! - Win!

1549
01:49:25,313 --> 01:49:26,330
Aunt!

1550
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:29,563
- Seas Grand Chief or small wonder! - Aunt!

1551
01:49:29,647 --> 01:49:32,063
- You may have cars. - Aunt!

1552
01:49:32,158 --> 01:49:33,480
- ¡Bungalow! - ¡Tía!

1553
01:49:33,605 --> 01:49:35,730
- A great bank balance! - Aunt.

1554
01:49:35,813 --> 01:49:37,730
- But he's ... - Aunt!

1555
01:49:37,818 --> 01:49:40,772
- A mother! - Hail, aunt!

1556
01:49:47,105 --> 01:49:50,218
Ali, you should play it safe and Vikram.

1557
01:50:09,563 --> 01:50:10,563
What do you do?

1558
01:50:34,855 --> 01:50:36,230
What are you gonna do, Ali?

1559
01:50:46,188 --> 01:50:48,698
I will pray and throw a six.

1560
01:51:44,688 --> 01:51:46,558
- Come now. - Run!

1561
01:51:46,647 --> 01:51:47,705
Because all...?

1562
01:51:51,678 --> 01:51:52,855
- Albatros. - What?

1563
01:51:53,158 --> 01:51:54,188
- It is gone. - Who?

1564
01:51:54,558 --> 01:51:55,658
Your.

1565
01:52:01,198 --> 01:52:02,230
¡Do!

1566
01:52:02,730 --> 01:52:03,778
¡Do!

1567
01:52:20,518 --> 01:52:23,018
Ali, you are a marvel.

1568
01:52:25,605 --> 01:52:26,980
Ali Monster.

1569
01:52:31,504 --> 01:52:46,504
CAPTION: YASSINE FALHI

1570
01:54:06,730 --> 01:54:07,788
Congratulations!

1571
01:54:08,813 --> 01:54:13,230
I just realized that the prayer of a mother and the love of a friend

1572
01:54:13,313 --> 01:54:15,377
They can despaired even God.

1573
01:54:17,717 --> 01:54:19,237
we are just slaves.

1574
01:54:19,730 --> 01:54:20,763
Aunt,

1575
01:54:21,857 --> 01:54:22,917
excuse me.

1576
01:54:22,938 --> 01:54:26,897
Ali, the determination with which your mother said you'd win,

1577
01:54:26,980 --> 01:54:28,938
Even I knew you'd win.

1578
01:54:29,017 --> 01:54:32,237
So I bet all my money to your victory.

1579
01:54:34,697 --> 01:54:37,772
Starting today, we will close all illegal businesses.

1580
01:54:39,897 --> 01:54:41,563
The rest is all first class.

1581
01:54:43,397 --> 01:54:45,647
I remember everything.

1582
01:54:45,938 --> 01:54:47,272
I remember everything now.

1583
01:54:47,355 --> 01:54:49,938
My money, my property, I remember where they are.

1584
01:54:50,105 --> 01:54:51,577
Over hustler What a man!

1585
01:54:51,797 --> 01:54:53,417
As we close the business.

1586
01:54:53,688 --> 01:54:56,577
Yes son. I remember everything.

1587
01:54:57,147 --> 01:54:58,188
- Uncle? - Yes.

1588
01:54:58,272 --> 01:55:00,772
What is worth all your property?

1589
01:55:00,855 --> 01:55:03,277
- Much. - Seriously?

1590
01:55:03,337 --> 01:55:05,897
300... 500... 600...

1591
01:55:05,980 --> 01:55:08,517
300 000 or 400 000.

1592
01:55:09,355 --> 01:55:11,938
Scoundrel, I spent more on their almonds and walnuts.

1593
01:55:13,313 --> 01:55:14,772
- Chief, the golden goose. - What?

1594
01:55:14,980 --> 01:55:16,057
Let's go from here.

1595
01:55:18,063 --> 01:55:20,022
Fakru, rogue. ¡Espera!

1596
01:55:51,897 --> 01:55:54,397
- You're very good. - What?

1597
01:55:54,563 --> 01:55:56,730
- Very good! - You deserve a cake, really.

1598
01:55:56,813 --> 01:55:58,022
I mean beautiful.

1599
01:55:58,105 --> 01:55:59,605
It was with good intention.

1600
01:56:08,617 --> 01:56:10,697
I LOVE Jaggu DADA
