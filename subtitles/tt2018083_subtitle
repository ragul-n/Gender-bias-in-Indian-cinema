1
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,841
Anakapalli

2
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:42,977
You're lucky to become
Choudhary's kinsman.

3
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:46,774
Choudhary too is lucky
to become Rao's kinsman.

4
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:50,885
Auspicious time is your
real lucky charm.

5
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:54,989
Not even Lord Brahma, the creator
can stop this marriage now.

6
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,993
ls it secret to say in ears?

7
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,657
Seenu is taking away the bride!

8
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,245
Seenu, leave me!

9
00:03:16,646 --> 00:03:18,113
Have you gone crazy?
Why are you taking me away?

10
00:03:18,314 --> 00:03:22,011
At last l'm getting married after
telling many lies, leave me.

11
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,315
Leave me l say!

12
00:03:30,893 --> 00:03:32,656
What are you doing, Seenu?

13
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:00,918
Lord Vinay!

14
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:05,787
As you wished l've eloped with
a bride from her marriage.

15
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,964
This was not my idea,
l did as you'd wished. Okay?

16
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,656
Why do you always make me
your partner in all your crimes?

17
00:04:11,868 --> 00:04:14,769
l know you'll approve
whatever l do.

18
00:04:14,937 --> 00:04:17,838
Because you share your
birthday with me, right?

19
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,407
They're catching up! Bye!

20
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:25,303
No God should ever have
a lousy devotee like you !

21
00:04:37,894 --> 00:04:40,886
Why are you sweating profusely?

22
00:04:43,165 --> 00:04:45,963
Who is this girl?

23
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:48,363
She's maths teacher
Rama Rao's daughter.

24
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:50,329
l kidnapped her from her marriage.

25
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,141
Why are you saying coolly after
eloping with her from marriage?

26
00:04:54,343 --> 00:04:57,039
lt won't be nice to elope after
she's married, leave it.

27
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:05,381
Your son is going overboard
again and again !

28
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:10,191
Fathers have sons to bring fame
but you've a son to bring infamy.

29
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:14,454
Had law been perfect your
family would be in jail, mind it.

30
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:16,957
Your son has dared...

31
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,896
l've been enduring him 24 hours
for the past 23 years,

32
00:05:20,102 --> 00:05:21,433
who is there to share my grief?

33
00:05:21,837 --> 00:05:23,930
Take your daughter and get her married
before the auspicious time elapses.

34
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,973
Come dear, how will l convince
the groom now?

35
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:29,804
May evil eyes cast on you...
- Epitome of evil, does he need this?

36
00:05:30,012 --> 00:05:31,479
Won't you let any marriage
take place here?

37
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:33,246
Dad, l gave you 6 months time
to arrange my marriage,

38
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:36,179
3 months have passed since deadline,
there's no reaction from you,

39
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:38,216
what l'm denied nobody
must have it here!

40
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,217
You didn't even finish
your graduation,

41
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,252
who would give his daughter
in marriage to you?

42
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:42,253
Anyway people settle down
in life and then marry.

43
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,949
Dad, people settle down
and then marry,

44
00:05:45,294 --> 00:05:46,921
but l'm different l'll settle
down with marriage.

45
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:48,756
He's different, don't leave him.
- Not leave him?

46
00:05:49,198 --> 00:05:52,224
You may be ready but no father is
ready to give his daughter to you.

47
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,767
There will be someone, leave it.
- Leave it?

48
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:57,405
You want to marry, right?
Leave it on me.

49
00:05:57,807 --> 00:06:01,368
lf not here, l'll find a beautiful
girl for you in next village.

50
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:04,273
Look uncle, you too wish to
find a girl in next village,

51
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,278
but not ready to give your
beautiful daughter Bujji.

52
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:09,451
Do you like my daughter Bujji?

53
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:10,978
Why do you doubt me, uncle?

54
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:14,156
l love your 100 acre farm,
aunt's trove of jewels,

55
00:06:14,357 --> 00:06:17,258
and l love your daughter
so much, uncle.

56
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,227
Leave it, tomorrow you and
my daughter are getting...

57
00:06:22,531 --> 00:06:23,896
Engaged!
- Yes, engaged!

58
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,067
Uncle!
- Son-in-law!

59
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:27,132
Uncle, you be firm on it.

60
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,836
Buddy!

61
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:32,836
Seenu's marriage is fixed with Bujji!

62
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,484
When my Bujji walks past...

63
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:53,224
When l hear her anklets ring...

64
00:06:53,529 --> 00:07:03,097
My heart dances like a peacock...

65
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,078
Hey! This isn't your character!
Get into your character!

66
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:39,307
You're called a gentleman
if you help others...

67
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:52,381
They'll felicitate and honour you
if you give them everything freely...

68
00:07:52,588 --> 00:07:56,285
Won't they fall at your feet
if you show little empathy?

69
00:07:56,492 --> 00:08:00,519
lf you fall for it, your life would
become a chaotic bus stand...

70
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,057
Why is it so?

71
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:05,290
lf you bend, you're gone...

72
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:07,366
What to do now?

73
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,561
Live life on your own terms like me...

74
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:11,963
ls it?

75
00:08:12,174 --> 00:08:15,041
l'm the tend setter...

76
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,444
Only girls have craze...

77
00:08:52,648 --> 00:08:54,616
But they are big show offs...

78
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:59,283
They never fall easily
if you express your love...

79
00:08:59,488 --> 00:09:03,549
lf you chase them endlessly
to love you...

80
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,695
lf they suddenly say sorry,
won't you become a patient?

81
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:12,227
lf they you're easy to get,
they'll go away from you...

82
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:16,427
lf you neglect them,
they'll get attracted like a magnet...

83
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:21,975
Girls always fall for
reverse gear only...

84
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,534
Don't listen to advices...
Do whatever you wish to do...

85
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:57,075
Every one gives you
a different lecture...

86
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,511
Don't be a fool...
be daring and dashing...

87
00:10:01,717 --> 00:10:05,551
Will you follow every advice
given by others?

88
00:10:05,754 --> 00:10:09,986
l'm crying from rooftop
don't listen to other's advices....

89
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:14,458
lf you follow it like sheep,
it's not my fault...

90
00:10:14,663 --> 00:10:19,157
Godmen are living on you only...

91
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,695
Why is it so?

92
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:26,131
Don't come again to the beginning!

93
00:10:26,342 --> 00:10:28,310
Why is it so?

94
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,478
Do something useful...

95
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,613
ls it?

96
00:10:32,815 --> 00:10:35,249
lf you ask me again, l'll beat you...

97
00:10:35,451 --> 00:10:39,410
Go...go...

98
00:10:54,703 --> 00:10:57,035
Sir, please exchange proposals.

99
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,537
You fool! Have you gone mad?

100
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,233
You're ruining a girl's life
by marrying her to him,

101
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:04,105
you're in for bad time.

102
00:11:04,313 --> 00:11:05,803
lt's not my bad time but
your time has come to go. Leave it.

103
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,715
Give it.

104
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:09,615
You damn old woman !

105
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,611
Father...father...

106
00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:16,282
l want to talk to him personally.

107
00:11:16,492 --> 00:11:19,427
You can talk to him only
after engagement, leave it.

108
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:22,119
Give it. Why did you get up now?

109
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:24,663
l'll talk to her, uncle.
- No please, leave it.

110
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,835
l'll talk to her, uncle.
- No please, leave it.

111
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:28,703
Bujji come, let's talk.

112
00:11:29,805 --> 00:11:31,432
You give it, brother-in-law.

113
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:44,784
Your dress is excellent!

114
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:46,415
This is nothing, marriage dress
would be rocking!

115
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,089
l've asked Tailor Kumar to make it.

116
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,155
Do you also want one?
- No please.

117
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:55,625
Tell me the reason for my topping
all the classes and district?

118
00:11:55,831 --> 00:11:57,822
Nothing, you're a good student,
you study well,

119
00:11:58,233 --> 00:11:59,757
you're clever and
smart in studies,

120
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:01,329
and have a good figure too!

121
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:04,665
No, l studied well working hard in
the fear that my parents would,

122
00:12:04,873 --> 00:12:10,334
marry me off to some
useless wastrel!

123
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:16,478
But l couldn't expect you'd be
that useless wastrel in my life.

124
00:12:17,586 --> 00:12:22,853
You didn't finish college,
getting a tenth failed girl is difficult,

125
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:25,860
why do you want me?

126
00:12:26,595 --> 00:12:29,655
Marrying me or stopping this
marriage in your hands,

127
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:33,392
l'm telling you a truth,
if you marry me against my wish,

128
00:12:33,602 --> 00:12:38,938
l'll elope with my lover Shankar
who works in Hi-tech city Hyderabad.

129
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,436
lf people come to know that
Seenu's wife has eloped,

130
00:12:43,645 --> 00:12:45,374
entire town would celebrate it.

131
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:48,647
This is true,
the ball is in your court.

132
00:12:53,422 --> 00:12:54,514
Bye dear!

133
00:13:09,304 --> 00:13:13,673
You didn't finish college,
getting a tenth failed girl is difficult,

134
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,571
why do you want me?

135
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:20,577
l'll elope with my lover Shankar
who works in Hi-tech city Hyderabad.

136
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,275
What happened my dear son?

137
00:13:25,254 --> 00:13:27,722
l've decided!
- What?

138
00:13:29,324 --> 00:13:31,656
l want to go to city and
complete my graduation.

139
00:13:32,694 --> 00:13:35,424
Degree?
- Will you finish your degree?

140
00:13:35,631 --> 00:13:36,791
You'd be 70 years
by the time you finish it.

141
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:37,829
Father!

142
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:41,469
Leave it, he wants to equal
my daughter in studies.

143
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,500
Let him go.

144
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:44,729
What about Bujji
if you go away, son?

145
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,706
Sister, my daughter would wait
for eons for your son.

146
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:52,778
My foot! She'll elope with Shankar.

147
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:56,646
Say you'll allow him to go.
Please allow him, brother-in-law.

148
00:13:56,852 --> 00:13:58,581
l don't have any hope.

149
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:02,780
Since you're insisting,
this is my last investment on him.

150
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:09,631
Uncle, paint the town red that
Seenu is going finish his degree.

151
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,336
ls there any festival in this place?

152
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:24,410
No, 23 years of bad time
is leaving this town.

153
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:39,823
See dad, entire town is here
to say good bye to me.

154
00:14:40,028 --> 00:14:42,861
lt's good bye if they do it
with one hand, look at them!

155
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:49,460
They're shaking both hands
it means don't come back!

156
00:15:00,883 --> 00:15:02,316
Looks like they're calling me!

157
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,418
Song?!

158
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:14,592
l'm condemning this, l want to study
lPS now and encounter him.

159
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:20,827
What's that? What are you doing
in a group of girls?

160
00:15:21,036 --> 00:15:23,527
What's in gender?
You couldn't but l could.

161
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:26,469
Logic is right.
- Hell with your logic.

162
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,734
What?

163
00:15:28,944 --> 00:15:32,072
So many girls attacking one boy!
- What if you're alone?

164
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:34,506
Did you touch me now?

165
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:39,376
Come on girls!

166
00:15:44,826 --> 00:15:47,021
Let's play a game of songs!

167
00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:50,421
Before that you must
have a sip, drink!

168
00:15:50,632 --> 00:15:52,896
Do you think its soft drink?
No, it's beer baby!

169
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:55,535
Drink...drink...

170
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:57,762
These rogues are best for you !

171
00:15:57,973 --> 00:16:02,342
Drink...drink...

172
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:08,474
ls lPS newspaper to read everyday?

173
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:10,879
Those rogues are teasing the girls,
what the hell did you do now?

174
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:13,987
What the hell did you do?

175
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,419
l'm waiting for this dialogue.

176
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,991
Hey, tell him about me!

177
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:26,629
Do you know who is Babu?
Do you know who his father is?

178
00:16:26,835 --> 00:16:29,463
Do you know who his brother is?
Do you know?

179
00:16:37,446 --> 00:16:39,573
By the way, do you know who l am?

180
00:16:45,687 --> 00:16:47,678
Kill him boys!

181
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:51,219
Tell me now who your father is!

182
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,117
You can tease girls like me
but don't torture them like you.

183
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,990
l'll not leave you !
- Get lost boy!

184
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:11,230
l've told you many times to
offer prayer before eating food.

185
00:18:12,641 --> 00:18:15,940
He'll not children eat peacefully,
to hell with him and his discipline.

186
00:18:17,946 --> 00:18:18,935
Pray!

187
00:18:19,147 --> 00:18:19,909
Grandfathers!

188
00:18:20,115 --> 00:18:24,017
Bless us to follow the path
of non-violence like you,

189
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:30,089
if not grow up to become like you
at least we must become like our father.

190
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:43,237
Nephew! l was fin and
you made me start a poultry farm,

191
00:18:43,638 --> 00:18:45,663
you came and l lost heavily on it.

192
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:49,139
So, l'm living peacefully
away from you.

193
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:51,071
Pray children !

194
00:18:51,646 --> 00:18:54,171
Uncle, you must never enter our lives,

195
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,073
and we may not get your characters,

196
00:18:56,284 --> 00:19:01,119
and we wish our lives
would go on peacefully.

197
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,619
True! The bell is ringing.

198
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:09,820
Hey uncle!

199
00:19:13,201 --> 00:19:15,567
Brother!
- Sister! l'm here!

200
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:18,103
l'm dead!
- Uncle is here!

201
00:19:25,614 --> 00:19:27,741
My home was silent like a library,

202
00:19:27,949 --> 00:19:31,680
with your arrival it has become
boisterous like our market.

203
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:33,978
Are you staying here for
a couple of days, nephew?

204
00:19:34,189 --> 00:19:37,920
Couple of days? l'm here to study,
l'll be here for 6 months.

205
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:52,738
Hey girl! How much is the cost
for incoming and out going?

206
00:19:53,742 --> 00:19:56,905
Just take one call or
you take group calls too.

207
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:03,007
Send that fresh one here!

208
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:07,918
You're going to class,
l'll give you something to cheer.

209
00:20:08,657 --> 00:20:09,214
Smoke!

210
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:11,649
Do you know who am l?
l'm SP's daughter!

211
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,954
Do you know who she is?
Commissioner's daughter!

212
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:18,394
We don't care about dads here,
we care about girls only.

213
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,358
Smoke!
- No please!

214
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:22,634
Smoke!
- No please!

215
00:20:27,943 --> 00:20:30,411
lf the girl is so good initially...

216
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:34,905
New admission?
- Yes.

217
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:41,077
lf they rag an SP's daughter, think
about a middle class girl's plight?

218
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:49,787
Go...go...

219
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:58,863
Boys are so scared on seeing her.
ls her father a politician?

220
00:20:59,074 --> 00:21:01,201
No, a bank employee.

221
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,909
ls her brother a goon?
- She's only daughter.

222
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:09,246
Why are the boys so scared
on seeing her?

223
00:21:38,842 --> 00:21:39,831
ls that the way to beat anyone?

224
00:21:40,043 --> 00:21:42,409
Like school children.
With soft hands!

225
00:21:43,046 --> 00:21:45,014
Do you know how one should beat?

226
00:22:01,932 --> 00:22:04,992
lt must knock-out like this.

227
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:07,861
lt must be like this only!

228
00:22:09,172 --> 00:22:14,701
He's Bhavani! He's the one
to create problem or solve it.

229
00:22:14,911 --> 00:22:17,106
Though he's strong,
he too has two weaknesses.

230
00:22:17,514 --> 00:22:20,039
One is he stammers
when he's too happy or sad,

231
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,714
two, we're going there now.

232
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,107
Do you know who he is, Shruthi?

233
00:22:52,582 --> 00:22:54,174
lt seems he saw you and
fell in love with you,

234
00:22:54,584 --> 00:22:58,042
and asked his parents to come
and meet your family,

235
00:22:58,255 --> 00:23:01,656
what should l do with him?
l hate even wind crossing between us,

236
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:04,156
how can l keep quiet if a man enters?

237
00:23:05,495 --> 00:23:09,989
Break his hands for itching
to tie the knot with her.

238
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:23,542
No...no...

239
00:23:23,747 --> 00:23:25,009
Stop it.

240
00:23:30,554 --> 00:23:36,493
l can't send SMS or emails
or chat like college students,

241
00:23:36,693 --> 00:23:41,153
l can show how much l love you
in actions like this.

242
00:23:50,674 --> 00:23:53,541
Greetings brother!

243
00:23:54,811 --> 00:23:57,746
Anything happening in college,
must information immediately.

244
00:23:57,948 --> 00:23:59,973
Nothing will reach you, brother.

245
00:24:01,351 --> 00:24:03,012
Everything must reach me.

246
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,744
You've taken money, right?
Explain it to him.

247
00:24:04,955 --> 00:24:06,547
You idiot! Can't you get it?

248
00:24:06,756 --> 00:24:13,252
What's this? You look soft
how could you love that goon?

249
00:24:16,733 --> 00:24:19,759
On the birthday of my
uncle's daughter...

250
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:26,200
Tell me.

251
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:31,946
Warn Yadav, get me my land
which he has occupied.

252
00:24:32,582 --> 00:24:35,949
He thinks l'll get scared
on seeing Bhavani.

253
00:25:04,147 --> 00:25:06,843
You're the first girl l had touched.

254
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:09,608
You're the fist girl to touch me.

255
00:25:09,819 --> 00:25:12,720
You must touch me all my life.

256
00:25:13,089 --> 00:25:14,750
l'll beat you with slippers,
you dirty goon !

257
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:17,586
Our family is well respected in society.

258
00:25:17,794 --> 00:25:21,730
You're a professional killer,
do you wish to marry my daughter?

259
00:25:37,948 --> 00:25:40,075
Father-in-law! Why did you kill them?

260
00:25:40,283 --> 00:25:42,808
Yours is well respected family, right?

261
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:46,284
You shot dead 4 people in a party!

262
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:51,024
Have you also become a goon
to become a goon's father-in-law?

263
00:25:51,227 --> 00:25:53,252
Hey goon father-in-law!

264
00:25:53,797 --> 00:25:58,325
Will you wash my feet with your
hands or go jail for killing them,

265
00:25:58,735 --> 00:25:59,827
it's your wish !

266
00:26:03,139 --> 00:26:07,007
l had to accept this marriage.

267
00:26:07,344 --> 00:26:10,404
l wanted to finish my studies,
so he gave me 6 months time.

268
00:26:10,847 --> 00:26:12,974
Can't you avoid this marriage?

269
00:26:13,183 --> 00:26:16,414
l can't...but l do have a small hope!

270
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:21,723
l wish to see the man who can beat
Bhavani before he marries me.

271
00:26:27,764 --> 00:26:31,131
Step in ! Take a step!

272
00:26:34,838 --> 00:26:38,934
With my entry life of the man who built
this college has become meaningful!

273
00:26:48,118 --> 00:26:49,813
Oh ! He has seen me!

274
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,180
What are you doing here?

275
00:26:51,388 --> 00:26:54,357
Have you followed me
so that l don't miss you?

276
00:26:54,758 --> 00:26:58,319
Follow you? No way!
l'm omnipresent God.

277
00:26:58,528 --> 00:27:02,897
l've decided to study well
and teach a lesson to Bujji.

278
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:06,159
So keep college troubles
away from me,

279
00:27:06,403 --> 00:27:07,836
and see that l don't fall for any girl,

280
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:09,062
and ensure no girl falls for me,

281
00:27:09,272 --> 00:27:11,137
studying well and
scoring 90%...

282
00:27:12,008 --> 00:27:14,408
Bless me to pass with
just pass marks.

283
00:27:14,811 --> 00:27:17,837
Bless me to befriend the
number student here.

284
00:27:19,082 --> 00:27:22,483
Lord! l'm going,
show me student number one!

285
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:47,035
Lord! See that nobody gets
beaten up because of me.

286
00:28:13,036 --> 00:28:16,005
Lord! Didn't you send me to
college to study?

287
00:28:16,206 --> 00:28:18,538
Your future wife is in
this college only,

288
00:28:18,942 --> 00:28:22,469
befriend her, fall in love and
then marry her.

289
00:28:27,984 --> 00:28:31,147
You're saying me all the best
by making the flower fall, right?

290
00:28:31,354 --> 00:28:33,322
lt fell in breeze.

291
00:28:36,126 --> 00:28:37,184
Go now!

292
00:28:43,032 --> 00:28:45,057
My entry will bring a good
turning point in your life.

293
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:47,994
l want to be your friend.

294
00:28:48,204 --> 00:28:50,172
Why? Don't you want to
be my friend?

295
00:28:50,373 --> 00:28:54,207
No, Vinay showed her only.
- Vinay? Who is it?

296
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:57,106
God! My friend Ganesha.
Repent for it.

297
00:28:57,313 --> 00:28:59,110
He's mad!

298
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,477
Do you know who Bhavani is?

299
00:29:02,886 --> 00:29:04,547
Why not? He plucks palm fruits
back in my place.

300
00:29:04,954 --> 00:29:09,015
Not the one in your hometown
but Bhavani who kills people here.

301
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:12,558
A dangerous goon !
Don't you know him?

302
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,455
Would l become cheap
if l say l don't know?

303
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:18,930
Let me claim l know him.
He? Why not?

304
00:29:19,135 --> 00:29:22,332
He was roaming uselessly there,
l sent him to become a goon here.

305
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:25,474
Useless guy has become popular.
We're very close friends.

306
00:29:25,675 --> 00:29:28,906
lf you ask how much...that much !

307
00:29:29,112 --> 00:29:33,947
lt seems he's very close to Bhavani,
can you do us a small help?

308
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,310
Help? l'll do it.

309
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:40,387
A man is torturing her to marry him.

310
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:44,617
Who is he?
l'll break his bones.

311
00:29:45,395 --> 00:29:47,386
What will you break? Chips!?

312
00:29:47,597 --> 00:29:50,896
Only Bhavani can dare beat him.

313
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,298
We've only heard about him,
don't know where he is and how he'll be!

314
00:29:55,505 --> 00:29:57,097
Since he's your close friend,

315
00:29:57,307 --> 00:30:00,435
just introduce him to us,
we'll solve our problem.

316
00:30:01,144 --> 00:30:02,133
Just a minute.

317
00:30:07,383 --> 00:30:11,649
Will you become my friend
if l introduce Bhavani to you?

318
00:30:12,689 --> 00:30:13,485
She will!

319
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:17,421
Then, l'll rap on Bhavani's head
and bring him to you tomorrow.

320
00:30:19,996 --> 00:30:21,657
Your name...?

321
00:30:26,102 --> 00:30:27,501
That's a film heroine's name, right?

322
00:30:27,704 --> 00:30:31,265
That's a reel heroine and
she's a real heroine.

323
00:30:31,474 --> 00:30:33,442
Not good?

324
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,944
Great! The name suits you
better than the heroine.

325
00:30:38,214 --> 00:30:40,114
Be careful!

326
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,988
l'm feeling shy!

327
00:30:47,357 --> 00:30:48,688
You've gone mad!

328
00:30:49,092 --> 00:30:53,654
Bhavani is the one who is torturing me,
will you ask Bhavani to beat Bhavani?

329
00:30:54,063 --> 00:30:57,362
lf that poor boy does something
and gets trapped with him.

330
00:30:57,567 --> 00:30:59,125
Does he look like on
to get beaten up?

331
00:30:59,335 --> 00:31:02,168
He looks like he'll beat up 10 guys.
Look at him!

332
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,974
l feel he's the turning point
in your life.

333
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:20,712
lf you open the scene in the
lush green beautiful Anakapalli...

334
00:31:21,224 --> 00:31:23,158
Why are you again talking
about Seenu?

335
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:25,224
Anything said about him is less.

336
00:31:25,428 --> 00:31:29,455
My father was just a village cobbler
and 10 year old Seenu tortured him,

337
00:31:29,632 --> 00:31:31,691
and we had to move to Hyderabad,
and it proved very lucky to us,

338
00:31:32,101 --> 00:31:34,569
we opened a Bata showroom
and living like Tata.

339
00:31:37,507 --> 00:31:41,204
So whenever l close my eyes,
l always see a young Seenu !

340
00:31:42,312 --> 00:31:43,142
Mischief!

341
00:31:46,749 --> 00:31:49,479
Looks like a grown up Seenu !

342
00:31:50,787 --> 00:31:52,618
Not like Seenu, l'm Seenu !

343
00:31:53,022 --> 00:31:55,252
Lets celebrate Seenu's arrival!

344
00:32:00,363 --> 00:32:04,060
Katrina Kaif? There's no girl
by that name in our college.

345
00:32:04,267 --> 00:32:05,234
There is.
- ls it?

346
00:32:05,435 --> 00:32:08,336
As soon as l saw her l felt
she was born for me,

347
00:32:08,538 --> 00:32:10,301
and fell in love with her,

348
00:32:10,506 --> 00:32:12,201
she's facing a small problem..

349
00:32:12,709 --> 00:32:13,698
Stop it!

350
00:32:15,712 --> 00:32:19,045
Some man is torturing
my Katrina to marry him,

351
00:32:19,282 --> 00:32:22,149
they asked me to get him beaten
by city's most feared goon,

352
00:32:22,352 --> 00:32:23,376
Let's get him bashed up!

353
00:32:23,586 --> 00:32:26,680
l told her that he's my friend,

354
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,489
and promised to get him
beaten up by that goon.

355
00:32:28,691 --> 00:32:30,090
Good show!

356
00:32:30,293 --> 00:32:33,558
Buddy! We must meet this
city's most feared goon.

357
00:32:33,763 --> 00:32:37,096
Not a big deal!
By the way, what's his name?

358
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:44,331
He has a name...Jawani...
Gawani...it's Bhavani!

359
00:32:45,808 --> 00:32:47,298
Where are you going?

360
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,808
lndeed going!
Do you know about him?

361
00:32:50,213 --> 00:32:53,182
Meeting him? Anyone meeting
him would wet his pants!

362
00:32:53,383 --> 00:32:55,613
And he's your best friend, good!

363
00:32:55,818 --> 00:32:58,286
Forget Katrina Kaif and
find yourself a Mumaith Khan.

364
00:32:58,488 --> 00:32:59,079
Come on friends.

365
00:32:59,288 --> 00:33:01,722
Go...friends are like this only.

366
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:03,615
They promise to give life over drinks,

367
00:33:03,826 --> 00:33:06,386
but when crunch situation
arrives, they'll escape.

368
00:33:07,296 --> 00:33:08,456
Like you guys!

369
00:33:09,665 --> 00:33:11,860
Are you suspecting my friendship?

370
00:33:12,602 --> 00:33:15,093
Okay, does she know
how Bhavani looks like?

371
00:33:15,304 --> 00:33:16,464
She doesn't know.

372
00:33:16,672 --> 00:33:22,845
Duryodhana! Then, let's introduce
an imposter as real Bhavani.

373
00:33:22,845 --> 00:33:27,077
lmposter Bhavani? Who is he?

374
00:33:43,433 --> 00:33:47,870
How come people are sipping coffee
so coolly even after my arrival?

375
00:33:54,877 --> 00:33:55,844
That's Bhavani!

376
00:33:56,245 --> 00:33:59,237
Come Bhavani!
- Seenu?

377
00:33:59,449 --> 00:34:00,507
You look like a gypsy in this dress.

378
00:34:00,716 --> 00:34:04,550
Gypsy? You don't decide
about my character.

379
00:34:09,158 --> 00:34:11,490
She's Katrina Kaif.

380
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:13,319
My...

381
00:34:16,732 --> 00:34:20,532
Who is she? Bipasha Basu?

382
00:34:21,437 --> 00:34:22,665
l'll relax here.

383
00:34:22,872 --> 00:34:24,567
He's overacting!

384
00:34:25,575 --> 00:34:27,702
Do you know who am l?
- Don't know uncle?

385
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:30,208
Seems they don't know me, let's go.

386
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:32,313
What happened, Bhavani?
- Asking me what happened?

387
00:34:32,515 --> 00:34:33,846
What can be more
humiliating than this?

388
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,239
They don't know me!

389
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:38,511
What the hell are you doing here?
Can't you tell them about me?

390
00:34:38,721 --> 00:34:41,189
She's like a matron and
yet doesn't know me.

391
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:43,790
Who do you think he is?
He's Bhavani! Sit down.

392
00:34:44,494 --> 00:34:47,930
Yes, l'm Bhavani. Any doubt?
- l'll tell them. Sit down.

393
00:34:49,799 --> 00:34:51,426
Tell him, what's your problem?

394
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:55,770
Not yet discussed the problem
and he wants an order.

395
00:34:55,972 --> 00:34:57,439
Do you've to be so violent?

396
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,403
My character behaves like that only.

397
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:05,342
Oh Bhavani! Come!

398
00:35:06,883 --> 00:35:10,785
Why are our women so sensitive?
- Our women?

399
00:35:10,987 --> 00:35:13,217
You ruined the scene
with your overacting.

400
00:35:13,856 --> 00:35:16,347
Am l overacting?

401
00:35:17,994 --> 00:35:20,724
l've become a real goon now!

402
00:35:27,737 --> 00:35:31,673
Hey! You came, you dashed
and you walked away!

403
00:35:31,874 --> 00:35:34,001
Who would say sorry to me?
Your mother's husband?

404
00:35:35,611 --> 00:35:38,307
Come...got him boss!

405
00:35:38,714 --> 00:35:42,912
Why are you leaving without
saying sorry to me?

406
00:35:43,319 --> 00:35:45,810
l'll hack him, boss.
- Hack me?

407
00:35:46,556 --> 00:35:50,822
Hack him? Look at hi get up!
He's a comedian. Come.

408
00:35:53,963 --> 00:35:55,362
Comedian?

409
00:35:56,933 --> 00:36:00,630
l'd asked permission for a building,
why are you running away?

410
00:36:02,572 --> 00:36:03,800
l can't give permission, sir.

411
00:36:04,006 --> 00:36:05,735
He says he won't,
can't you hear it?

412
00:36:05,942 --> 00:36:09,935
He says he won't, forget him,
l'm saying impossible.

413
00:36:10,346 --> 00:36:12,314
What will you do if l say l won't?

414
00:36:12,515 --> 00:36:15,916
What will you do man?
l'll kill you.

415
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,720
How dare you refuse permission
to Bhavani!

416
00:36:19,956 --> 00:36:21,651
ls he Bhavani?

417
00:36:28,931 --> 00:36:31,525
l'll talk to you despite trying
to convince me.

418
00:36:31,734 --> 00:36:33,599
Did you see Katrina?
- No.

419
00:36:33,803 --> 00:36:35,270
ls he your lover?

420
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:41,902
Where is she?

421
00:36:49,852 --> 00:36:50,819
Great!

422
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,750
Did Katrina Kaif come this side?
- Why would she come here?

423
00:36:53,956 --> 00:36:55,548
She's studying in our college, right?

424
00:36:55,758 --> 00:36:57,783
When did she join without
our knowledge?

425
00:36:57,994 --> 00:36:59,859
Just now she left with Salman.

426
00:37:05,434 --> 00:37:09,564
Who is he?
- New student!- Bring him!

427
00:37:17,346 --> 00:37:20,782
Holding Seenu's collar is touching
high tension live wire.

428
00:37:20,983 --> 00:37:22,575
lt'll electrocute you !

429
00:37:33,796 --> 00:37:35,093
Why is running?

430
00:37:39,835 --> 00:37:40,426
Are you here?
l was coming for you only.

431
00:37:40,636 --> 00:37:41,762
Did you beat anyone from that gang?

432
00:37:41,971 --> 00:37:43,097
l don't know which gang
but l beat one boy.

433
00:37:43,506 --> 00:37:46,441
He's coming with 20 members!
Escape!

434
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:02,488
Would we keep quiet if you
beat a man from my gang?

435
00:38:02,692 --> 00:38:06,753
Are you running scared of
getting bashed up by my gang?

436
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:10,360
l'm not scared of you
beating me up,

437
00:38:10,566 --> 00:38:12,363
worried l may bash you up guys!

438
00:38:12,868 --> 00:38:14,733
Are you such a macho man?

439
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:18,638
l do but l'm not in mood now.
Come later.

440
00:38:18,808 --> 00:38:20,673
We don't take mood off
for an answer,

441
00:38:20,876 --> 00:38:22,707
we brought bats and stumps
from another gang.

442
00:38:22,912 --> 00:38:23,901
We can't return it without using.

443
00:38:24,113 --> 00:38:25,171
Let's settle it now!

444
00:38:25,581 --> 00:38:26,570
Right!

445
00:38:27,483 --> 00:38:29,075
You're forcing it on me.

446
00:38:29,485 --> 00:38:31,578
Okay, l'm giving you 3 options,

447
00:38:31,787 --> 00:38:32,811
One, l'll beat you,

448
00:38:33,022 --> 00:38:34,717

449
00:38:34,924 --> 00:38:38,792
three, l'll beat you black and blue!

450
00:38:39,528 --> 00:38:43,589
Three of you who wish to
thrash me come forward.

451
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:48,059
lf you like the way l beat them,
let's fight it out.

452
00:38:59,014 --> 00:39:02,848
Now first, l'll beat now! Come!

453
00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:13,488
Second, l'll thrash now! Come.

454
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:24,497
Third, l'll beat black and blue.
My favourite!

455
00:39:24,907 --> 00:39:28,809
This may break your bones,
split your nerves,

456
00:39:29,011 --> 00:39:31,878
and may make you forget your past.
Don't ask me later.

457
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:35,482
Hey blade! Come!

458
00:39:35,684 --> 00:39:39,245
Go...go... Go!

459
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:43,721
Where do you want me to go?

460
00:39:43,926 --> 00:39:45,791
Can't you see two licking ground?

461
00:39:45,995 --> 00:39:48,896
lt seems third one is his
favourite, why not you go?

462
00:39:49,098 --> 00:39:50,224
You go!

463
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,627
What are you discussing there?

464
00:39:52,835 --> 00:39:55,269
Can't you see we're discussing?

465
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:58,001
We were going to watch a film,
you brought us here,

466
00:39:58,207 --> 00:40:02,109
look at him!
ls it the way to bash humans?

467
00:40:02,845 --> 00:40:04,836
Brother, l too have three options.

468
00:40:05,047 --> 00:40:06,605
One, l'll run,

469
00:40:06,816 --> 00:40:08,841
two, l'll run very fast,

470
00:40:09,051 --> 00:40:13,010
three, this is my favourite,
l'll run without getting caught.

471
00:40:13,222 --> 00:40:14,519
Mine is third option.

472
00:40:14,723 --> 00:40:15,815
Run boys!

473
00:40:19,562 --> 00:40:23,692
Seenu is very tough !

474
00:40:23,899 --> 00:40:24,729
Visakhapatnam

475
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:27,993
Let it be any difficult,
l'll catch him, sir.

476
00:40:35,144 --> 00:40:41,845
l want passenger list of 23 bogies of
Janmabhumi express of last month 18th.

477
00:40:42,051 --> 00:40:43,575
lt's against rules.

478
00:40:49,191 --> 00:40:51,659
ls it still against rules?

479
00:40:56,866 --> 00:40:58,663
Leave us sir...

480
00:41:04,206 --> 00:41:09,974
Sir...l beg you sir...
beg you sir...

481
00:41:13,148 --> 00:41:16,117
l'll not feel even if you kill me.

482
00:41:16,752 --> 00:41:20,085
But if you cheat me...

483
00:41:21,657 --> 00:41:23,090
Sir, we got the list.

484
00:41:23,292 --> 00:41:30,824
Take the name, address of young men
between 22 and 25 years.

485
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:35,766
l want the man who beat my boys.

486
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:40,639
Why did you bring us here?

487
00:41:41,409 --> 00:41:42,740
Katrina is here.
- How do you know?

488
00:41:43,144 --> 00:41:45,578
Bhaskar said her friend is
always with her.

489
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,714
Wherever Katrina is there,
she follows her like Hutch dog.

490
00:41:48,115 --> 00:41:49,412
How can you be so sure?

491
00:41:49,617 --> 00:41:51,278
Aren't you there wherever l'm?

492
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:52,144
Come.

493
00:41:52,353 --> 00:41:53,581
Look, this is good.

494
00:41:54,522 --> 00:41:58,219
Seenu's phone call.
- Don't answer it.

495
00:41:58,459 --> 00:42:00,552
Wait, let's give him a shock.

496
00:42:02,596 --> 00:42:06,191
l didn't call to hear your lousy voice,
where are you now?

497
00:42:06,701 --> 00:42:08,794
We're near Charminar, Seenu.

498
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:12,634
When did Charminar was
shifted to Ameerpet?

499
00:42:13,507 --> 00:42:15,634
He's somewhere here only.

500
00:42:15,843 --> 00:42:17,708
Look Katrina!

501
00:42:19,313 --> 00:42:20,143
That girl?!

502
00:42:20,348 --> 00:42:21,508
l'll be back in a minute.

503
00:42:33,494 --> 00:42:36,759
Look Katrina, l've decided.
No more Bhavani!

504
00:42:37,198 --> 00:42:41,396
Tell me who is torturing you,
l'll take on him myself.

505
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,708
Figure is ravishing!

506
00:42:54,682 --> 00:42:59,278
How dare you pass comment on
my boss Bhavani's future wife!

507
00:43:05,259 --> 00:43:06,226
Stop boys!

508
00:43:07,228 --> 00:43:08,490
Madam, you carry on.

509
00:43:15,202 --> 00:43:17,397
When you said you love a girl,
l thought someone else,

510
00:43:17,605 --> 00:43:19,800
are you in love with the girl
Bhavani wants to marry?

511
00:43:20,207 --> 00:43:22,732
Your time is good,
they got beaten up instead of you.

512
00:43:23,677 --> 00:43:25,542
Why did Katrina's friend
told me like that?

513
00:43:25,746 --> 00:43:27,509
Her name is Shruthi not Katrina Kaif.

514
00:43:27,715 --> 00:43:29,410
They're playing a game with you.

515
00:43:32,386 --> 00:43:34,286
l'm clear about one thing now.
- What?

516
00:43:34,488 --> 00:43:37,218
The problem in Shruthi's life
is Bhavani.

517
00:43:37,425 --> 00:43:40,519
Shruthi hates him.
- So what?

518
00:43:41,562 --> 00:43:44,395
l'll enter the vacant heart
of Shruthi on RAC ticket,

519
00:43:44,598 --> 00:43:47,499
l'll get my berth confirmed,
and sleep happily in her heart.

520
00:43:47,701 --> 00:43:49,532
Berth for you and death for us.

521
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:43,779
Champakamala, don't kill me dear...

522
00:44:43,991 --> 00:44:49,725
Come to me, hide me in you...

523
00:44:54,635 --> 00:45:00,972
Get caught and share me my dear...

524
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:05,436
For your good,
let me tell you something...

525
00:45:05,646 --> 00:45:09,480
No use in following me...
l can give you nothing...

526
00:45:09,683 --> 00:45:15,815
l've my own problems aplenty...
Understand my feelings...

527
00:45:50,724 --> 00:45:54,751
When you enter my dreams,
l stand up...

528
00:45:54,962 --> 00:45:59,023
l go sleepless and
want you to sing a lullaby...

529
00:45:59,433 --> 00:46:02,834
l want you listen to my problems...

530
00:46:03,037 --> 00:46:06,734
l'm warning you not to follow
me seeking love...

531
00:46:06,941 --> 00:46:09,409
Your life will be in risk...

532
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:13,376
l've only one thing that's love
and it never listens to anyone...

533
00:46:13,581 --> 00:46:17,608
l'll die for you...
lt's your problem to control it...

534
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:19,911
lf you refuse to love me
citing risk as ruse...

535
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:30,587
l'll go restless peaceless
with high fever...

536
00:46:47,715 --> 00:46:51,708
Your assets are mind boggling...

537
00:46:51,919 --> 00:46:56,049
Your vital statistics are perfect...

538
00:46:56,457 --> 00:46:59,756
l'm unable to stop myself...

539
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,760
Yes, l'm a Rose...

540
00:47:04,098 --> 00:47:05,998
No, thorn may hurt you...

541
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,027
What l'm seeking is with you...

542
00:47:08,435 --> 00:47:10,096
l can't take a no form you...

543
00:47:10,537 --> 00:47:12,437
My youth yearning for you...

544
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,574
l wish you give me the
hidden treasure...

545
00:47:14,775 --> 00:47:19,712
Give it dousing with fragrant
scent and flowers...

546
00:47:26,153 --> 00:47:28,053
Your little heart...

547
00:48:17,571 --> 00:48:20,096
We're scared of Bhavani and
you want to elope with her.

548
00:48:20,507 --> 00:48:21,735
lt's making us wet our pants.

549
00:48:21,942 --> 00:48:25,173
That's him, brother!
- Give him a scare!

550
00:48:25,646 --> 00:48:27,580
8What if Bhavani comes to know this?

551
00:48:28,248 --> 00:48:29,909
He already know it.

552
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:31,982
Who is Seenu amongst you?

553
00:48:32,653 --> 00:48:33,585
He!

554
00:48:34,955 --> 00:48:37,685
Are you getting too smart?
Bhavani is here, come.

555
00:48:38,058 --> 00:48:39,958
Brother...l must go to college.

556
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,684
You can go to college later,
come with me.

557
00:48:41,895 --> 00:48:43,954
Please brother, l'm an orphan.
My mother will kill me.

558
00:48:44,164 --> 00:48:47,258
When you're so scared, why did
you interfere in brother's matter?

559
00:48:47,668 --> 00:48:50,159
lf you cross swords with
brother's man,

560
00:48:50,571 --> 00:48:52,505
tell him!
- Okay brother.

561
00:48:56,176 --> 00:48:59,771
Warn him? He wetted his pant
on hearing brother's name.

562
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,038
Bhavani knows the matter.

563
00:49:01,248 --> 00:49:04,479
l'm sure he'll kill you,
go away to hometown.

564
00:49:04,718 --> 00:49:08,154
Should l get scared of Bhavani?

565
00:49:13,527 --> 00:49:15,017
Why did you come here?

566
00:49:15,229 --> 00:49:17,254
Brother is tensed, come later.
- l'll talk to him once.

567
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:21,600
He bashed up our boys in college,
l said you called him to scare him.

568
00:49:21,802 --> 00:49:23,099
He called me...

569
00:49:27,074 --> 00:49:29,907
Has he come to meet
after knowing about me?

570
00:49:30,344 --> 00:49:33,780
What's your name?
- Brother, my name is Seenu.

571
00:49:33,981 --> 00:49:35,846
l've come to study in Hyderabad.

572
00:49:36,316 --> 00:49:39,149
Why are you getting involved
in trouble instead of studying?

573
00:49:39,353 --> 00:49:40,581
Cool brother, is this trouble?

574
00:49:40,788 --> 00:49:43,086
How dare you argue with boss!
- Stop brother!

575
00:49:43,657 --> 00:49:45,625
Hearing their statements and fearing
you would do something with me,

576
00:49:45,826 --> 00:49:49,887
l'm here to tell you directly what
had really happened there, brother.

577
00:49:50,564 --> 00:49:52,031
l entered college, l prayed to God,

578
00:49:52,232 --> 00:49:55,065
l turned back and l saw a girl
and fell in love with her instantly,

579
00:49:57,604 --> 00:49:58,628
Love?

580
00:50:00,007 --> 00:50:00,769
Go ahead!

581
00:50:00,974 --> 00:50:04,637
l went after her to say
l love you with her,

582
00:50:08,248 --> 00:50:10,079
l was almost determined to tell her,

583
00:50:11,585 --> 00:50:12,882
suddenly these guys, your gang!

584
00:50:13,086 --> 00:50:16,886
They bashed up four men who passed
comments on her in a shopping mall.

585
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,785
Then l came to know!

586
00:50:20,894 --> 00:50:25,160
The girl l loved is none other than
the girl Bhavani wants to marry.

587
00:50:35,209 --> 00:50:36,642
Leave him!

588
00:50:37,344 --> 00:50:38,572
Brother!

589
00:50:40,347 --> 00:50:41,712
Leave him!

590
00:50:47,087 --> 00:50:48,315
Go ahead!

591
00:50:49,957 --> 00:50:51,185
Please move back.

592
00:50:57,297 --> 00:50:58,662
Where did l stop it?

593
00:50:59,733 --> 00:51:01,701
l asked him who this Bhavani is?

594
00:51:02,169 --> 00:51:05,036
They told me about you, brother!

595
00:51:05,973 --> 00:51:07,634
Basha's backdrop!

596
00:51:08,375 --> 00:51:11,708
l went after her thinking she's
another middle class girl.

597
00:51:11,912 --> 00:51:13,174
No brother...no...

598
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,679
You and your backdrop, l Seenu drop!

599
00:51:19,753 --> 00:51:20,811
Why did he get up?

600
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:24,323
Will he beat me?

601
00:51:39,773 --> 00:51:43,174
Our guy says he has a
problem with our boys.

602
00:51:43,377 --> 00:51:47,074
He says it seems he saw her
and fell in love with her,

603
00:51:47,281 --> 00:51:50,717
and went after her for few days
to express his love.

604
00:51:51,818 --> 00:51:52,910
Knowing about me,

605
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,678
mustering great courage,
entering my home,

606
00:51:54,888 --> 00:51:57,982
and standing before me,
until he tells me,

607
00:51:58,191 --> 00:52:01,160
l don't know the matter that
a man is in love with Shruthi.

608
00:52:03,463 --> 00:52:05,158
What the hell were you doing?

609
00:52:07,467 --> 00:52:09,435
Wasn't l called for this matter?

610
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:11,828
Did l blurt out truth going overboard?

611
00:52:15,742 --> 00:52:16,731
Bye brother!

612
00:52:17,077 --> 00:52:19,011
Hereafter...
- There's nothing anymore, brother.

613
00:52:19,212 --> 00:52:23,171
Everything is shut,
l'm crystal clear. bye.

614
00:52:24,184 --> 00:52:29,087
Not just days or hours or minutes,
keep an eye on her every moment.

615
00:52:29,323 --> 00:52:31,052
lf anyone dares...

616
00:52:31,258 --> 00:52:33,021
Why are you laughing now?

617
00:52:33,226 --> 00:52:35,456
Nothing brother.
- Why are you laughing now?

618
00:52:35,862 --> 00:52:37,955
The matter is...

619
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,765
You bash anyone who dares
to ogle Shruthi,

620
00:52:43,971 --> 00:52:46,235
you break limbs if anyone dares
to tell her l love you,

621
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,206
this is the angle you know,
there's another angle to it,

622
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:53,402
if a real man enters Shruthi's life,

623
00:52:53,814 --> 00:52:55,372
and if Shruthi too likes him,

624
00:52:55,782 --> 00:52:57,215
What if she falls in love with him?

625
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:03,146
You can guard humans but not heart.

626
00:53:03,357 --> 00:53:06,793
So, before anything like that
happens, you marry her.

627
00:53:06,994 --> 00:53:07,824
Bye!

628
00:53:11,331 --> 00:53:15,199
Will Shruthi fall
if she meets a real man?

629
00:53:16,403 --> 00:53:19,930
lf a man sincerely loves a girl,

630
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:23,769
he won't bother if she's police
officer or politician's daughter,

631
00:53:23,977 --> 00:53:25,444
he'll take her with him!

632
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:28,411
lf a girl truly loves the man,

633
00:53:28,815 --> 00:53:34,014
let any hurdle come in the form of
mafia or goons or any rogue like you,

634
00:53:34,221 --> 00:53:36,382
nothing can stop her!
She'll go with him!

635
00:53:38,425 --> 00:53:40,256
Don't you watch TV or
read newspapers?

636
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:42,928
That's the fad of youth !

637
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:45,455
That's the matter, bye brother.

638
00:53:45,899 --> 00:53:47,924
lf youth's trend that as you say,

639
00:53:48,135 --> 00:53:49,796
l dare challenge you to
make Shruthi fall for you !

640
00:53:53,907 --> 00:53:56,933
l didn't tell about me or Shruthi,
l said about today's trend.

641
00:53:57,144 --> 00:54:00,011
You've told me about a thing
which l didn't know,

642
00:54:00,213 --> 00:54:03,182
l feel you're the right man
to make her fall for you.

643
00:54:03,383 --> 00:54:05,943
l must know if Shruthi will
fall for you or not.

644
00:54:06,153 --> 00:54:07,017
Let me see if you can make her fall!

645
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:11,122
l came here to study, brother.
lf you really want, try another...

646
00:54:11,324 --> 00:54:14,555
l don't want anyone else,
l want you to do it.

647
00:54:14,961 --> 00:54:17,794
lf she fall in love with you,
l'll spare your life.

648
00:54:19,266 --> 00:54:24,966
lf she doesn't fall in love with you,
l'll behead you.

649
00:54:28,408 --> 00:54:32,174
To live l want my head,
so l'll love her.

650
00:54:32,379 --> 00:54:34,939
99.99% l'm sure she'll fall in love.

651
00:54:35,148 --> 00:54:37,378
Meanwhile your boys mustn't
get excited and...

652
00:54:38,518 --> 00:54:41,976
From tomorrow none of you
must disturb him.

653
00:54:43,123 --> 00:54:47,150
l'm giving you full freedom.
- Thanks brother...bye!

654
00:54:51,231 --> 00:54:53,256
l'll come back after
making her fall for me.

655
00:54:56,570 --> 00:55:00,506
ldiot! He dared to challenge me!

656
00:55:02,442 --> 00:55:05,036
Why did you ask him to love her?

657
00:55:06,046 --> 00:55:09,311
What he said is true!
- lf..

658
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:13,110
lf Shruthi loves him,
that's also good.

659
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:16,389
lf l kill her lover before her eyes,

660
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:23,655
she'll not dare to see or think of
any other man even after marriage.

661
00:55:25,932 --> 00:55:27,365
l need a scapegoat for it.

662
00:55:28,468 --> 00:55:31,528
He came searching to me.

663
00:55:34,141 --> 00:55:36,041
Where is your turning point Seenu?

664
00:55:36,243 --> 00:55:41,112
l think he would've ran away after
knowing about you in the mall.

665
00:55:57,531 --> 00:55:59,658
Where is it? Did l forget it?

666
00:56:08,275 --> 00:56:10,140
What l said and
what you heard is right!

667
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:19,277
l'm clear!
You need to be clear.

668
00:56:19,486 --> 00:56:21,420
Take as much time as you
want to tell me l love you,

669
00:56:21,621 --> 00:56:23,088
there's no hurry,

670
00:56:26,326 --> 00:56:28,590
once you say l love you to me,

671
00:56:29,596 --> 00:56:33,532
forget about anyone daring
to come between us,

672
00:56:35,702 --> 00:56:37,169
l'll take you away with me!

673
00:56:38,171 --> 00:56:39,661
Shruthi, you've seen only
one side o life.

674
00:56:40,073 --> 00:56:44,305
Hereafter l'll show you
what real life is!

675
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,353
Brother is playing chess.
- Matter is very serious.

676
00:56:56,556 --> 00:57:00,287
Brother, Seenu presented a flower
and said l love you to Shruthi.

677
00:57:00,493 --> 00:57:03,291
Brother, checkmate!

678
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:12,495
Who is he?

679
00:57:12,706 --> 00:57:19,043
Did his parents sent him to college
to study or deliver messages of love?

680
00:57:19,512 --> 00:57:24,040
Show this interest on studies
or else you'll end up like me. Go!

681
00:57:25,285 --> 00:57:26,616
Bloody idiot!

682
00:57:28,421 --> 00:57:30,651
You said checkmate!
- Wrong move, brother.

683
00:57:34,094 --> 00:57:35,686
The game starts now!

684
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:40,490
ls she so beautiful?
- Like this she too is hot!

685
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:41,689
ls it?

686
00:57:42,102 --> 00:57:46,664
lt will be if Bhavani comes to know,
we'll be hanging like meat!

687
00:57:47,073 --> 00:57:50,065
Don't give her up fearing him.

688
00:57:50,277 --> 00:57:54,077
lf there's any problem, your uncle
will take care of Bhavani.

689
00:57:54,314 --> 00:57:56,373
Uncle will not be there to see also.

690
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:59,617
How can Shruthi love you
who fears Bhavani?

691
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,278
Where there's fear,
there's no love,

692
00:58:01,488 --> 00:58:03,183
where there's love,
there's no fear.

693
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:06,086
First l must get rid of fear
from Shruthi.

694
00:58:12,532 --> 00:58:15,023
How is your business?

695
00:58:19,806 --> 00:58:21,239
Do you've Shruthilayalu CD?

696
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:27,611
Do you've any CD's of her films?

697
00:58:36,456 --> 00:58:38,321
Look at your age and
the CD's you're buying!

698
00:58:38,525 --> 00:58:41,119
What will become of me if you listen
to devotional music at this age?

699
00:58:41,795 --> 00:58:43,820
What's your problem?
l've already told you.

700
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:45,720
Why are you still chasing me?

701
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:49,225
Please go away.
- Talk respectfully.

702
00:58:49,502 --> 00:58:51,834
He'll not go.
- Then, l'll go.

703
00:58:53,206 --> 00:58:54,571
Can l bill it, sir?

704
00:58:55,608 --> 00:58:57,132
Why did you talk to her like that?

705
00:58:57,344 --> 00:58:58,709
l was supporting you, sir.

706
00:59:02,415 --> 00:59:04,406
No use when Shruthi is not here.

707
00:59:04,617 --> 00:59:05,777
Then these...?

708
00:59:10,724 --> 00:59:14,285
Break into small pieces,
pack those pieces,

709
00:59:14,494 --> 00:59:15,756
and shove it into you !

710
00:59:18,365 --> 00:59:20,162
Stop Shruthi!
l couldn't sleep last night.

711
00:59:20,367 --> 00:59:22,858
My heart is heavy, why?
- Consult a cardiac surgeon.

712
00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:26,329
l'm seeing you in everyone. Why?
- Consult an eye doctor.

713
00:59:26,539 --> 00:59:29,099
l feel like breaking into a jig
on thinking about you. Why?

714
00:59:29,309 --> 00:59:31,834
Consult a mental hospital.
- Then, you take me.

715
00:59:39,719 --> 00:59:41,744
Come...
- What happened?

716
00:59:42,155 --> 00:59:43,179
Bhavani's men are standing there.

717
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:45,620
lf they see us together,
they'll...

718
00:59:47,427 --> 00:59:48,257
Come.

719
00:59:49,462 --> 00:59:51,760
Acting aloof though you
love me so much !

720
00:59:52,298 --> 00:59:54,766
No need to fear them anymore.
Wait, l'll tell them to leave.

721
00:59:54,968 --> 00:59:56,833
No...no...

722
00:59:57,470 --> 01:00:00,701
Why are you disturbing me?
Are you here to shop?

723
01:00:00,907 --> 01:00:02,602
Brother, take money.

724
01:00:03,843 --> 01:00:06,334
Collection?
l thought you were shopping.

725
01:00:06,546 --> 01:00:08,844
There's breaking news for your boss,

726
01:00:09,249 --> 01:00:11,683
Shruthi will fall for me in
another 2 or 3 days,

727
01:00:12,685 --> 01:00:14,346
tell your boss to find
another girl for himself.

728
01:00:14,554 --> 01:00:16,419
lf he delays further,
he may lose another wicket.

729
01:00:17,357 --> 01:00:21,259
Will you beat me?
Come on, beat me!

730
01:00:21,795 --> 01:00:23,729
Come...come boys...

731
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:24,897
Why are you leaving him?

732
01:00:25,298 --> 01:00:27,562
lf we harm him, the girl may fall
for him in sympathy.

733
01:00:27,767 --> 01:00:30,565
lf we don't do anything,
she may fall for his machinations.

734
01:00:30,837 --> 01:00:32,702
What did you tell them?
- l told them the truth.

735
01:00:32,906 --> 01:00:35,739
Anyway she'll fall for me and
told him to find another girl.

736
01:00:36,576 --> 01:00:38,544
Did you tell them?
lf they go and tell him,

737
01:00:38,745 --> 01:00:40,269
do you think would he keep quiet?

738
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,381
He'll break your limbs
and kill you.

739
01:00:43,616 --> 01:00:46,642
No use in scolding you,
l must scold your parents.

740
01:00:46,853 --> 01:00:49,879
Get lost! l don't care whatever
may happen to you !

741
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:53,748
But if anything happens to you,
please don't tell me!

742
01:00:58,431 --> 01:01:01,400
Boys always love with smile,

743
01:01:01,601 --> 01:01:03,569
why do girls always cry
and then love?

744
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:06,864
lf she's feeling so much
for me, it means...

745
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:12,710
Sir, his name is Seenu !
He's in Hyderabad now.

746
01:01:12,912 --> 01:01:15,005
l don't want any information,

747
01:01:15,415 --> 01:01:19,476
if you ever come here,
come with him, got it?

748
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:41,572
Uncle, phone for you.

749
01:01:47,918 --> 01:01:49,010
What has happened to her?

750
01:02:01,465 --> 01:02:02,432
Here!

751
01:02:03,567 --> 01:02:04,397
What are you doing here?

752
01:02:04,601 --> 01:02:06,592
ln my bedroom!
Please go away!

753
01:02:07,037 --> 01:02:11,337
Why are you cutting the phone calls
after saying hello since evening?

754
01:02:11,542 --> 01:02:14,067
l was checking if your phone
is working or not.

755
01:02:14,278 --> 01:02:19,409
There are operators to check it.
What's the matter?

756
01:02:20,951 --> 01:02:25,615
You've a doubt that Bhavani would've
beaten me and l'd be in hospital.

757
01:02:26,023 --> 01:02:28,617
Why are you sleeping here?
Get up, what if my dad sees?

758
01:02:29,059 --> 01:02:29,957
What if he sees?

759
01:02:32,996 --> 01:02:34,623
Why are you acting tough
though you love me so much?

760
01:02:35,032 --> 01:02:38,160
Come to college bus stop
tomorrow at 9 am,

761
01:02:38,368 --> 01:02:40,131
let's go out and have fun !

762
01:02:40,971 --> 01:02:43,235
Go out? No way!

763
01:02:45,509 --> 01:02:46,441
That's what irritates me!

764
01:02:46,643 --> 01:02:48,577
That's your problem,
you refuse to express your love,

765
01:02:48,979 --> 01:02:49,638
you refuse to come out with me,

766
01:02:50,047 --> 01:02:50,945
Bhavani is much better than you,

767
01:02:51,148 --> 01:02:53,309
he's clear in mind!
Are you coming or not?

768
01:02:53,517 --> 01:02:54,484
l will not.

769
01:02:55,586 --> 01:02:59,147
lf you don't come at 9 am tomorrow,

770
01:02:59,356 --> 01:03:02,086
l'll stand before Bhavani at 9.05 am!

771
01:03:03,594 --> 01:03:06,222
Won't you come still?
- No way!

772
01:03:08,699 --> 01:03:10,530
You said you'll not but
have come at 8.50 am only.

773
01:03:11,268 --> 01:03:12,428
l came to tell l'll not come at 9 am.

774
01:03:12,636 --> 01:03:17,596
Stop joking and hop on bike.
- Bike? What? No way!

775
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:21,601
Give the phone to Bhavani please.

776
01:03:22,012 --> 01:03:23,445
Will you stop it now?

777
01:03:24,248 --> 01:03:26,580
Girls never listen to
anything said directly.

778
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:27,516
Okay.

779
01:03:27,718 --> 01:03:29,345
Sub-Registrar's office, Hyderabad

780
01:03:31,121 --> 01:03:32,986
Shakes whatever you see, idiot!

781
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:36,284
ls everything ready?
- Ready.

782
01:03:37,094 --> 01:03:40,461
Where's the Registrar?
- He has come.

783
01:03:44,201 --> 01:03:46,192
What are you doing here?

784
01:03:46,403 --> 01:03:48,030
How can you marry without me?

785
01:03:48,238 --> 01:03:50,069
How could you join him?

786
01:03:50,274 --> 01:03:51,673
Stop acting and change the dress.

787
01:03:52,075 --> 01:03:53,633
Should l do everything you say?
No, l'll not change.

788
01:03:54,044 --> 01:03:56,444
You don't have that much,
go and change.

789
01:03:56,647 --> 01:03:58,239
We still have got some time.

790
01:03:59,216 --> 01:04:02,310
What's this marriage suddenly?

791
01:04:02,519 --> 01:04:05,147
l told you my marriage is fixed
with my uncle's son, right?

792
01:04:06,056 --> 01:04:08,456
Our families have broken up due
to differences in business,

793
01:04:08,659 --> 01:04:10,524
and they've cancelled
the marriage,

794
01:04:10,727 --> 01:04:16,723
l was confused and
Seenu is arranging our marriage.

795
01:04:17,134 --> 01:04:21,468
Though we may have many friends,
just one Seenu in them is enough.

796
01:04:22,306 --> 01:04:24,740
Shruthi, don't miss Seenu.

797
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,004
Witness signatures please.

798
01:04:39,489 --> 01:04:40,353
Take it.

799
01:04:41,291 --> 01:04:44,727
Did l bring you here for nothing?
Sign as witness for their marriage.

800
01:04:49,499 --> 01:04:53,094
Drop them safely at airport.
- Okay.

801
01:04:53,303 --> 01:04:55,203
Step into the car with right leg.

802
01:04:55,405 --> 01:04:56,736
l'll get my bike.

803
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:16,423
l'm Narsing!
Yadav's younger brother!

804
01:05:21,298 --> 01:05:22,788
Your life is with me now.

805
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,691
Enough of shouting at me!

806
01:05:26,103 --> 01:05:30,062
lf you want her alive,
come to the Dhaba alone.

807
01:05:38,849 --> 01:05:41,113
Brother, tell me...

808
01:05:41,385 --> 01:05:42,682
l'm on duty, brother.

809
01:05:42,886 --> 01:05:45,582
l'll come evening, brother.

810
01:05:57,567 --> 01:05:58,591
Go fast!

811
01:06:10,313 --> 01:06:11,473
Go fast!

812
01:06:22,459 --> 01:06:25,155
They're catching up, Seenu !
Let's go!

813
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:28,630
Let's go, come.

814
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,362
Seenu, let's go.

815
01:06:31,568 --> 01:06:33,365
Don't get sacred! l'll beat...

816
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:35,504
You're scared of Bhavani
and these guys!

817
01:06:35,705 --> 01:06:36,797
You'll be scared of someone
else tomorrow.

818
01:06:37,207 --> 01:06:40,267
How long and how many people
would you be afraid of?

819
01:06:40,644 --> 01:06:42,407
lf you get scared,
they'll scare you,

820
01:06:42,612 --> 01:06:43,874
if you scare them,
they'll get scared.

821
01:06:44,281 --> 01:06:46,146
Throw out the fear from you.

822
01:06:46,616 --> 01:06:49,312
Hey, send the girl!

823
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:54,252
May no one would care if you
abduct a girl from the road,

824
01:06:54,458 --> 01:06:58,827
but if a man stands up
to you daringly,

825
01:06:59,362 --> 01:07:01,353
l'm sure he would be her lover!

826
01:07:01,531 --> 01:07:06,867
l'm her lover, if anyone of you
touch her after crossing me,

827
01:07:07,537 --> 01:07:08,936
l'll leave her to you !

828
01:07:11,241 --> 01:07:13,175
lf you touch her!

829
01:07:14,578 --> 01:07:16,773
lt seems he'll give her
if we touch, go.

830
01:07:35,332 --> 01:07:36,162
Go boys!

831
01:09:05,889 --> 01:09:07,857
What else do you want?

832
01:09:08,425 --> 01:09:10,450
How many more should l bash up
to get rid of fear in you?

833
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:13,857
What else should l do to make
a girl like you love me?

834
01:09:31,381 --> 01:09:34,942
l expected someone would to
beat them, you thrashed them!

835
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:46,523
Bash anyone who stops you...
Thrash them black and blue...

836
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:47,890
Bash them again and again...

837
01:09:48,098 --> 01:09:53,798
Break them into pieces...
Let them go mad with knock-out punches...

838
01:09:54,004 --> 01:09:57,440
Break their bones!

839
01:10:17,494 --> 01:10:19,962
l'm little proud and
my punches are knock-out..

840
01:10:20,163 --> 01:10:23,997
lt'll leave the enemy
sleepless for a month...

841
01:10:29,005 --> 01:10:31,667
l'm little short temper...
l'll take the wind of their sails...

842
01:10:31,875 --> 01:10:35,936
When l enter the arena,
l'll rock...

843
01:10:37,614 --> 01:10:40,412
Bash them so that
whistles blow for you...

844
01:10:40,617 --> 01:10:43,381
Get a standing ovation with
your thrashing of enemies...

845
01:10:43,586 --> 01:10:46,111
By hook or crook
like you made me fall for you...

846
01:10:46,556 --> 01:10:49,116
Let's pain the streets red
with celebration...

847
01:10:49,526 --> 01:10:54,623
Seenu rocks...
He's little crack...

848
01:10:55,131 --> 01:11:00,626
His entry is shock to others...
That shakes up everything...

849
01:11:36,072 --> 01:11:38,802
She's mine,
if you dare trouble her...

850
01:11:39,008 --> 01:11:41,738
He'll rip out your skin...

851
01:11:41,945 --> 01:11:44,607
lf you still dare to chase her...

852
01:11:44,814 --> 01:11:47,783
He'll fix you once for all...

853
01:11:47,984 --> 01:11:50,612
Every young man must see you...

854
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:53,653
On knowing about me
must see you as his sister...

855
01:11:53,857 --> 01:11:56,451
Everyone must ogle
and love you...

856
01:11:56,659 --> 01:11:59,150
But on seeing me must run
with their tails between legs...

857
01:11:59,562 --> 01:12:01,860
Thrash them to make them go mad...

858
01:12:02,065 --> 01:12:04,932
Bash them to celebrate it with fun...

859
01:12:05,135 --> 01:12:11,165
O man ! My heart is knocked out
with your one manly punch...

860
01:12:57,787 --> 01:13:00,551
lf anyone dares pass comments
on her figure and beauty...

861
01:13:00,757 --> 01:13:03,248
He'll smash and drive you crazy...

862
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:06,128
lf anyone dares to ask
her phone number...

863
01:13:06,329 --> 01:13:09,230
He'll strangle their neck
and bury them...

864
01:13:09,632 --> 01:13:12,226
l must ask what gift you want...

865
01:13:12,635 --> 01:13:15,103
l'll send the money like a King...

866
01:13:15,305 --> 01:13:18,001
l must keep on singing paeans
about your beauty...

867
01:13:18,208 --> 01:13:20,699
lf you show me to them,
they must vanish...

868
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:26,576
Thrash to rock me...
Bash me to raise the dust...

869
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:29,513
Hammer me and
hold my thin waist...

870
01:13:29,719 --> 01:13:32,950
Show me stars in daylight...

871
01:13:55,812 --> 01:13:57,074
Where is Shruthi?

872
01:13:58,681 --> 01:14:00,876
Why are you laughing?
Where is she?

873
01:14:02,318 --> 01:14:05,310
Shruthi is not yours anymore...
a man came...

874
01:14:05,722 --> 01:14:09,590
He thrashed us and
took her with him.

875
01:14:09,893 --> 01:14:11,986
Do you know why that
man thrashed us?

876
01:14:12,195 --> 01:14:13,787
He loves Shruthi.

877
01:14:13,997 --> 01:14:19,230
Not only she expresses her love,
saw her hug him and plant kisses...

878
01:14:19,802 --> 01:14:22,794
Do you know who he is?
Seenu !

879
01:14:24,908 --> 01:14:27,001
Real man has entered your life!

880
01:14:27,210 --> 01:14:29,337
He'll hit you in the right spot!

881
01:14:31,114 --> 01:14:33,207
l want to see it!

882
01:14:34,817 --> 01:14:37,911
l'll not give you that opportunity.

883
01:14:43,026 --> 01:14:47,053
Brother!
- Kill Seenu wherever you see him!

884
01:14:53,002 --> 01:14:53,832
Go!

885
01:15:03,212 --> 01:15:05,339
Catch him wherever he may be!

886
01:15:06,015 --> 01:15:07,209
He mustn't cross the city.

887
01:15:07,417 --> 01:15:12,116
Don't leave any place,
search him everywhere.

888
01:15:12,989 --> 01:15:21,419
Hit...hit...Dhoni...you must hit!

889
01:15:32,141 --> 01:15:33,665
Brother! Have you come?

890
01:15:39,449 --> 01:15:42,418
What a shot Dhoni hit!
lndia won Australia lost!

891
01:15:42,819 --> 01:15:44,218
But your TV is not working properly.

892
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:46,684
Aren't you paying cable properly?

893
01:15:49,025 --> 01:15:51,755
Why did l come?

894
01:15:52,228 --> 01:15:53,126
She fell!

895
01:15:54,263 --> 01:15:58,427
Brother, Shruthi fell
in love with me.

896
01:15:58,835 --> 01:16:03,795
Deep! So deep that she
can't live without me.

897
01:16:03,973 --> 01:16:05,201
She has fallen in love.

898
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:09,842
You don't believe me, right?
Just a minute.

899
01:16:12,215 --> 01:16:13,375
Shruthi's number!

900
01:16:18,354 --> 01:16:22,120
Please tell me l love you !
- Why?

901
01:16:22,325 --> 01:16:24,156
Please say it!

902
01:16:28,731 --> 01:16:32,223
Not like that, yesterday you hugged
me and said it with a feel.

903
01:16:32,435 --> 01:16:33,459
Say like that.

904
01:16:37,173 --> 01:16:38,299
Rocking!

905
01:16:38,775 --> 01:16:42,939
You said about beating,
add and say it again.

906
01:16:43,212 --> 01:16:45,339
l expected someone would
to beat them,

907
01:16:45,948 --> 01:16:48,007
but found a man
who thrashed them!

908
01:16:51,354 --> 01:16:52,981
Then, my...

909
01:17:01,998 --> 01:17:02,930
That's the matter, bro!

910
01:17:03,132 --> 01:17:05,896
You said she'll not fall
and l said she's fall.

911
01:17:06,102 --> 01:17:08,935
Look she has fallen !
Deal is done between us!

912
01:17:12,408 --> 01:17:14,876
Chintu, take care of brother.

913
01:17:15,812 --> 01:17:16,369
Keep it.

914
01:17:19,182 --> 01:17:23,812
lf you select another girl...
l'll be at peace!

915
01:17:25,021 --> 01:17:26,921
Bye brother!

916
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:29,485
When l planned for Shruthi...

917
01:17:32,028 --> 01:17:35,156
Would l arrange your marriage
if you make her fall for you?

918
01:17:36,065 --> 01:17:41,469
Fear she lost with your love,
l'll bring it back with your death.

919
01:17:42,605 --> 01:17:44,038
Kill him boys!

920
01:17:49,078 --> 01:17:51,171
No bro...no...

921
01:17:51,481 --> 01:17:54,973
You touched me once and
your love story hit deadend.

922
01:17:55,518 --> 01:17:58,885
lf you dare touch me again...

923
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:06,458
Your life will hit a deadend.

924
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,090
He's ordering to kill me.

925
01:19:23,673 --> 01:19:25,641
Bloody crap!

926
01:20:05,748 --> 01:20:10,185
Come...come come...

927
01:20:25,468 --> 01:20:26,958
Sit brother!

928
01:20:31,107 --> 01:20:32,665
l said sit!

929
01:20:37,413 --> 01:20:40,280
l told you to find another man.

930
01:20:40,483 --> 01:20:43,213
But you insisted l must do it.

931
01:20:45,087 --> 01:20:49,421
You don't know about me.
l'm from Anakapalli.

932
01:20:50,192 --> 01:20:53,423
Walk, run or catch a train
or bus and ask there,

933
01:20:53,629 --> 01:20:55,494
who is Seenu?

934
01:20:55,698 --> 01:20:57,996
They'll tell Seenu is worse
crook than you !

935
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,168
You come and touch me then.

936
01:21:04,073 --> 01:21:06,098
Why is he getting excited
when you're so cool?

937
01:21:07,009 --> 01:21:11,105
You thought Shruthi belongs to one
who has muscle and money power,

938
01:21:11,314 --> 01:21:14,442
l'm saying Shruthi belongs
to one she loves!

939
01:21:14,650 --> 01:21:19,053
Shruthi loves me! She's mine!

940
01:21:20,222 --> 01:21:24,283
lf you create any problem
or hurdle...

941
01:21:28,664 --> 01:21:32,100
l'll smash you !

942
01:21:52,455 --> 01:21:53,422
Stop it!

943
01:21:53,823 --> 01:21:55,791
What's this? What happened?

944
01:22:01,097 --> 01:22:04,362
l took time to devour your beauty.

945
01:22:04,567 --> 01:22:07,001
But l gave you 6 months
time to study.

946
01:22:07,203 --> 01:22:09,034
You fell for him in 6 days.

947
01:22:09,239 --> 01:22:11,207
Bhavani, leave her...
where are you taking her?

948
01:22:11,408 --> 01:22:16,277
This is my fixed deposit,
l'm taking after it has matured.

949
01:22:16,479 --> 01:22:20,142
Tomorrow l'm marrying her,
take a day off to enjoy feast.

950
01:22:20,350 --> 01:22:21,180
Come.

951
01:22:27,017 --> 01:22:29,645
l wanted bring you here
after our marriage.

952
01:22:30,053 --> 01:22:31,680
But l had to now.

953
01:22:33,524 --> 01:22:36,118
Tell me if you've friends,
l'll invite them to the marriage.

954
01:22:41,265 --> 01:22:42,562
lnvite just one man,
that's enough !

955
01:22:42,966 --> 01:22:48,029
The real man who entered
your life, invite him!

956
01:22:48,238 --> 01:22:52,299
l'll marry you !

957
01:22:54,111 --> 01:22:56,079
What will he do?
Will he elope with you?

958
01:22:56,280 --> 01:23:03,083
l'll invite him and
make him play marriage band.

959
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:09,352
Brother, dress is great,
marriage will rock.

960
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:12,028
What rock!
lt's Seenu opposing him!

961
01:23:12,229 --> 01:23:14,720
What did you think now?
- Nothing brother!

962
01:23:15,132 --> 01:23:18,158
l know what you thought,
but they must know it, right?

963
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:20,768
Nothing brother,
it's Seenu opposing you.

964
01:23:21,171 --> 01:23:22,331
Heard him, this is the public talk.

965
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:25,269
Seenu can't take any chances,
l've hundred men,

966
01:23:25,475 --> 01:23:27,306
once he comes in,
he won't go out.

967
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:33,445
But still we must be careful!
Because it's Seenu against me!

968
01:23:45,662 --> 01:23:48,324
lnvitation ! Your boss invited m!

969
01:23:50,434 --> 01:23:51,662
Tell me if your boss is scared,
l'll leave.

970
01:23:52,069 --> 01:24:00,807
Our boss scared? No way!

971
01:24:01,211 --> 01:24:02,644
Brother! l'm here!

972
01:24:04,681 --> 01:24:07,741
What a get up and set up! Rocking!

973
01:24:08,151 --> 01:24:11,382
l expected you'd touch me,
my family and my friends,

974
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:13,180
you touched my heart!

975
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:17,053
Whatever it is, l'm happy you've
invited me for your marriage.

976
01:24:17,327 --> 01:24:19,659
Are the arrangements going on well?

977
01:24:20,063 --> 01:24:22,691
Why are you playing so dull?
Just rock it!

978
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:26,463
l'll sit in the front row and
watch the marriage proceedings.

979
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:35,271
What? What's that stare for?

980
01:24:35,479 --> 01:24:36,741
What's your plan, Seenu?

981
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:41,376
How many people?
- 100 men !

982
01:24:41,585 --> 01:24:44,486
You're 100 men and l'm alone,
what can l plan?

983
01:24:44,688 --> 01:24:45,814
Mind your business.

984
01:25:01,705 --> 01:25:03,832
What sir?
- Look this side.

985
01:25:14,418 --> 01:25:16,443
l don't have the courage
to watch this marriage.

986
01:25:17,621 --> 01:25:21,682
My friends told me you can't watch
your lover marrying another man.

987
01:25:21,892 --> 01:25:24,292
l was adamant to attend
and came here.

988
01:25:24,895 --> 01:25:26,829
l can't take it anymore.

989
01:25:30,434 --> 01:25:32,402
Bless you !

990
01:25:37,908 --> 01:25:41,537
How come you're leaving your
lover to marry another man?

991
01:25:41,745 --> 01:25:44,543
How many people?
- 100 men !

992
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:49,285
l'm solo! Can't match them!

993
01:25:54,825 --> 01:25:59,125
l don't know how you're feeling,
l can't take it anymore.

994
01:25:59,329 --> 01:26:00,819
He's upstaging me in overacting!

995
01:26:02,466 --> 01:26:03,490
What?
- Where are you?

996
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,725
Just now Shruthi has entered
the marriage canopy.

997
01:26:05,936 --> 01:26:09,167
l'll elope with her.
- Elope? How?

998
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:10,836
Watch now!

999
01:26:38,301 --> 01:26:40,599
l told you it's Seenu that side!

1000
01:26:41,838 --> 01:26:44,773
Why isn't anyone following me?

1001
01:26:45,442 --> 01:26:48,377
lt'll take them a month to reach us.

1002
01:27:38,895 --> 01:27:41,363
Get her into the vehicle!

1003
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:26,998
Where is Shruthi? You took
her away from the marriage.

1004
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:31,938
So many Scorpios and so many
goons, definitely not my men.

1005
01:28:32,349 --> 01:28:33,873
l'm not that powerful.

1006
01:28:35,452 --> 01:28:37,386
Do you know who sent them?

1007
01:28:37,587 --> 01:28:42,490
The man who is ten times powerful
than me and shake goons like me,

1008
01:28:43,326 --> 01:28:45,294
Warangal Rajanna!

1009
01:28:51,001 --> 01:28:55,404
Bloody! How dare you
act smart with me!

1010
01:28:55,605 --> 01:28:57,664
l'll rip out your skin !

1011
01:28:57,874 --> 01:29:00,934
Who is Rajanna?
Why did he kidnap Shruthi?

1012
01:29:01,144 --> 01:29:02,543
That's your doubt, right?

1013
01:29:02,746 --> 01:29:07,615
You're never calm, while coming to
Hyderabad from your place in train,

1014
01:29:07,817 --> 01:29:09,478
do you remember
beating up young men?

1015
01:29:17,527 --> 01:29:20,860
Do you think they belong to one
of the youth who got beaten up?

1016
01:29:21,565 --> 01:29:24,090
The real twist begins now!
May l tell?

1017
01:29:24,601 --> 01:29:25,625
ln that fight,

1018
01:29:25,835 --> 01:29:28,998
your words, your fighting, your style,

1019
01:29:29,406 --> 01:29:34,036
a girl liked it and fell in love with
you without your knowledge,

1020
01:29:35,045 --> 01:29:38,640
the girl is none other
than Rajanna's daughter.

1021
01:29:55,031 --> 01:29:58,933
Rajanna dotes his daughter!

1022
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:02,963
lf she asks l want 10 heads,
he'll bring it.

1023
01:30:03,173 --> 01:30:05,664
lf she asks, l want your head dad,

1024
01:30:05,875 --> 01:30:09,106
he'll present it to her
without a blink.

1025
01:30:09,579 --> 01:30:13,675
And she asked him for you !

1026
01:30:21,691 --> 01:30:28,722
His men searched for you and
met me on the eve of marriage.

1027
01:30:31,234 --> 01:30:32,599
l told Rajanna,

1028
01:30:32,802 --> 01:30:34,963
it's not so easy to take
Seenu with you,

1029
01:30:35,171 --> 01:30:39,005
if you take Shruthi,
Seenu will follow you to your home.

1030
01:30:39,676 --> 01:30:41,667
You've only two options now!

1031
01:30:41,878 --> 01:30:44,870
One, marry Rajanna's daughter,

1032
01:30:45,081 --> 01:30:48,915
two, get killed in Rajanna's hands.

1033
01:30:52,856 --> 01:30:53,845
Great boy!

1034
01:30:54,057 --> 01:30:58,858
People hit the soft place of enemy.
But you hit my soft place.

1035
01:31:02,565 --> 01:31:04,089
But l must tell you a thing now.

1036
01:31:04,534 --> 01:31:07,697
Till now you've seen me for
Bhavani's range only!

1037
01:31:08,071 --> 01:31:11,472
l'll show Rajanna
what my real range is!

1038
01:31:11,675 --> 01:31:18,171
l'll make him go crazy in fear over
when and how l'll take Shruthi.

1039
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:33,888
Seenu is my future son-in-law.

1040
01:31:34,998 --> 01:31:36,795
lf you do as l say,

1041
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,731
l'll send you as my daughter
from this house,

1042
01:31:41,905 --> 01:31:46,501
if you say no,
l'll rip out your skin.

1043
01:31:54,651 --> 01:31:54,912
Who is Rajanna here?

1044
01:32:36,559 --> 01:32:38,220
Father! He's here!

1045
01:32:50,039 --> 01:32:54,772
Son-in-law is really a good fighter!

1046
01:33:07,056 --> 01:33:08,751
Beat them!

1047
01:33:19,769 --> 01:33:20,827
Stop!

1048
01:33:22,071 --> 01:33:24,096
How come so many turned suddenly?
l'm saved!

1049
01:33:27,010 --> 01:33:32,312
Why did you stop? Come on !
- Great!

1050
01:33:33,383 --> 01:33:36,841
Entering my home and
stamping on my man's chest,

1051
01:33:37,053 --> 01:33:39,920
my son-in-law is snapping his finger!

1052
01:33:40,123 --> 01:33:44,924
lsn't my son-in-law like a lion?

1053
01:33:45,762 --> 01:33:46,353
Clear out!

1054
01:33:48,198 --> 01:33:52,828
Do you think l can't take
Shruthi from you?

1055
01:33:53,036 --> 01:33:57,700
Did you see? l can beat anyone
and take her in seconds.

1056
01:34:00,143 --> 01:34:03,738
But l'll not take her!

1057
01:34:05,715 --> 01:34:09,651
Because l was wiating for a
father-in-law with such a background.

1058
01:34:09,853 --> 01:34:12,287
Why did you waste so many
Scopios and men?

1059
01:34:12,689 --> 01:34:15,157
Won't l come if you just
make a phone call?

1060
01:34:15,725 --> 01:34:17,215
But what l'm trying to say is,

1061
01:34:17,427 --> 01:34:19,190
to become son-in-law of
this palatial house,

1062
01:34:19,395 --> 01:34:22,330
and become husband of
your princess like daughter,

1063
01:34:25,268 --> 01:34:27,930
it's okay to me!

1064
01:34:31,007 --> 01:34:33,271
But you love her, right?

1065
01:34:33,676 --> 01:34:36,144
l did love her, father-in-law
but she's from a middle class,

1066
01:34:36,346 --> 01:34:37,938
leave middle class girl midway.

1067
01:34:38,147 --> 01:34:40,707
Shruthi, l've got an opportunity
to settle in life,

1068
01:34:40,917 --> 01:34:43,385
you too find a good boy
and settle in life.

1069
01:34:45,955 --> 01:34:49,413
You're very smart!

1070
01:34:49,826 --> 01:34:54,058
To come good in life you must know
what to hold on and what to give up.

1071
01:34:54,264 --> 01:34:57,859
You're great!

1072
01:34:59,102 --> 01:35:01,798
You doubted how l would
explain son-in-law,

1073
01:35:02,005 --> 01:35:02,733
did you see him now?

1074
01:35:02,939 --> 01:35:06,102
Son-in-law, tomorrow you're
marrying my daughter.

1075
01:35:06,309 --> 01:35:10,405
Tomorrow? Why so quickly?
We need at least 10 days.

1076
01:35:10,813 --> 01:35:12,474
10 days? Why?

1077
01:35:12,882 --> 01:35:15,214
To understand your daughter
and she must know me,

1078
01:35:15,418 --> 01:35:17,147
and the chemistry between
us must work out,

1079
01:35:17,353 --> 01:35:20,720
maths and science must also gel!

1080
01:35:20,924 --> 01:35:23,119
Son-in-law is well educated!

1081
01:35:23,326 --> 01:35:25,920
lt's not studies but creating trouble.

1082
01:35:26,229 --> 01:35:28,959
l can accept anything but
l won't change the marriage date.

1083
01:35:29,165 --> 01:35:30,359
Father!

1084
01:35:31,134 --> 01:35:35,434
l've waited for him so many months,
can't l wait for 10 more days?

1085
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:38,467
ls she the girl who fell
in love with me?

1086
01:35:38,875 --> 01:35:40,365
No dear!

1087
01:35:40,877 --> 01:35:44,074
Just do what he says
if not l'll get angry.

1088
01:35:44,547 --> 01:35:47,072
Okay dear, l'll do it.

1089
01:35:47,283 --> 01:35:52,380
Marriage is after 10 days
Warangal must rock!

1090
01:36:04,167 --> 01:36:05,725
What shall we do with her?

1091
01:36:05,935 --> 01:36:09,268
For safer side, let her be here
till the marriage.

1092
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:13,465
Son-in-law! l don't mind if you kill me!

1093
01:36:13,876 --> 01:36:16,436
But don't you dare cheat me!

1094
01:36:35,365 --> 01:36:38,528
Boss, it seems Rajanna's daughter
is getting married.

1095
01:36:38,935 --> 01:36:41,199
Grandpa! Father!

1096
01:36:41,404 --> 01:36:45,204
l'll kill him in 10 days
and take my revenge.

1097
01:36:45,408 --> 01:36:48,206
What you couldn't do in 25 years,
how can you do it 10 days?

1098
01:36:48,411 --> 01:36:51,812
Don't insult our enmity of generations!

1099
01:36:52,015 --> 01:36:54,347
What enmity?
For just one feet of land!

1100
01:36:54,550 --> 01:36:57,246
Rajanna has 500 acres
and we too have 500 acres,

1101
01:36:57,387 --> 01:36:59,355
saying Rajanna has
occupied a feet of land,

1102
01:36:59,555 --> 01:37:02,251
will you sell 500 acres and property
and bring us to streets?

1103
01:37:02,458 --> 01:37:04,824
l had an lnfosys job with
Rs.50000 salary,

1104
01:37:05,028 --> 01:37:08,964
you said revenge brought me here
and turned me into a cook.

1105
01:37:09,165 --> 01:37:11,030
l'm hungry, Chinna.

1106
01:37:11,367 --> 01:37:12,129
Eat!

1107
01:37:12,335 --> 01:37:15,361
Same stuff every day!
l've to take loan to buy this.

1108
01:37:15,571 --> 01:37:19,371
lf you buy e a flight ticket,
l'll go to Delhi and file the case.

1109
01:37:20,076 --> 01:37:21,566
Do you need flight amidst this fight?

1110
01:37:21,978 --> 01:37:24,913
Don't shout on my lawyer.

1111
01:37:27,950 --> 01:37:32,478
Lawyer, we may lose money
but we must win the case.

1112
01:37:46,135 --> 01:37:49,263
What a jolt you gave him, boss!
Call him on phone.

1113
01:37:51,407 --> 01:37:52,931
Where is she?

1114
01:37:58,614 --> 01:38:01,606
You said you'll escape
with her form there,

1115
01:38:02,018 --> 01:38:04,316
but it seems you've agreed
to marry her in 10 days.

1116
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:08,320
Rajanna doesn't know about me
so he agreed for 10 days,

1117
01:38:08,524 --> 01:38:11,891
you know very well about me,
yet how can you be so relaxed!

1118
01:38:12,095 --> 01:38:13,653
You fool!

1119
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:18,628
You eunuch ! l didn't ask 10 days
time to marry her,

1120
01:38:19,035 --> 01:38:21,868
to elope with Shruthi from here.

1121
01:38:22,572 --> 01:38:28,067
lt can 10, 5, 3 days or today
if l get into the mood.

1122
01:38:28,578 --> 01:38:32,207
Shruthi, leave it...

1123
01:38:49,532 --> 01:38:51,432
Go out!

1124
01:38:52,268 --> 01:38:53,428
What's your name?

1125
01:38:55,271 --> 01:38:56,397
My name is Sandhya.

1126
01:38:56,606 --> 01:38:59,541
My father always buys anything
for me in pairs only.

1127
01:38:59,742 --> 01:39:03,303
You can take one set.
But don't ask my husband also.

1128
01:39:03,513 --> 01:39:05,174
He's mine only!

1129
01:39:05,381 --> 01:39:06,541
Where's Shruthi?

1130
01:39:08,084 --> 01:39:11,019
l saw him before you and
fell in love with him.

1131
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:13,085
l'm not doing any injustice to you.

1132
01:39:13,289 --> 01:39:18,226
Okay, what else? Do you watch films?
Who is your favourite...

1133
01:39:22,498 --> 01:39:24,989
Oh ! He's calling me!

1134
01:39:29,539 --> 01:39:30,528
Did you call me?

1135
01:39:30,740 --> 01:39:33,641
Feeling so shy!
lt's better to know her character.

1136
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:38,647
l'm feeling shy, l'll go.

1137
01:39:40,283 --> 01:39:42,342
lt's not good, be free with me.

1138
01:39:43,386 --> 01:39:46,355
Free means?
- Free means friendly.

1139
01:39:46,756 --> 01:39:51,250
Then, l'm your friend.
Keep like this and turn with thumb.

1140
01:39:55,398 --> 01:39:56,365
Tell me about you.

1141
01:39:56,566 --> 01:40:01,970
l'm smart always, we're very rich,
l love my father.

1142
01:40:02,171 --> 01:40:06,631
l love when my uncle breaks bones.

1143
01:40:07,043 --> 01:40:08,203
Why were you born so talented?

1144
01:40:08,411 --> 01:40:15,249
l love films!
l'm mad about love films.

1145
01:40:15,651 --> 01:40:20,350
My life ambition is love marriage.
- Why are you marrying me then?

1146
01:40:20,556 --> 01:40:24,322
Why are you asking me that?
l love you, right?- Why?

1147
01:40:24,527 --> 01:40:32,730
Why? You broke the bones of
those young men in the train.

1148
01:40:33,302 --> 01:40:34,291
Did you fall for my fight?

1149
01:40:34,503 --> 01:40:39,998
Not just fight, l still remember
your style and dialogue vividly.

1150
01:40:40,209 --> 01:40:44,270
You can tease girls like me
but don't torture them like you.

1151
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:46,380
You delivered it great!

1152
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:55,657
Why are you laughing at me?

1153
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,021
You don't love me, Sandhya.

1154
01:40:59,228 --> 01:41:02,288
You like me.
- Like or love is same.

1155
01:41:02,498 --> 01:41:05,058
Liking and love is different.
How am l to tell you?

1156
01:41:05,268 --> 01:41:07,463
Do you like Jackie Chan's fights?
- l like.

1157
01:41:07,670 --> 01:41:09,194
Prabhu Deva's dance?
- l like.

1158
01:41:09,405 --> 01:41:12,101
Brahmanandam's comedy?
- l like very much.

1159
01:41:12,308 --> 01:41:15,209
Do you love anyone of them?
- No!

1160
01:41:15,411 --> 01:41:18,505
Likewise you saw my fight and
like me for my style.

1161
01:41:18,714 --> 01:41:21,376
And think it is love.
- What is love then?

1162
01:41:21,584 --> 01:41:26,385
Love means...it's a flame!
An accident! A lightning!

1163
01:41:26,589 --> 01:41:30,787
First time when l saw Shruthi,
a bell rang in my heart.

1164
01:41:31,193 --> 01:41:35,562
l made the bell ring in her heart too,
and we became lovers.

1165
01:41:38,601 --> 01:41:41,126
Love shouldn't be one sided,

1166
01:41:41,337 --> 01:41:45,831
it's perfect only when love
is reciprocated by other.

1167
01:41:46,809 --> 01:41:47,776
ls it?

1168
01:41:48,177 --> 01:41:52,113
Did the bell ring in your heart when
you saw me first time in train?

1169
01:41:53,249 --> 01:41:55,444
No!
- Then, l'm not your lover.

1170
01:41:56,419 --> 01:41:59,513
lsn't ours love marriage then?

1171
01:41:59,822 --> 01:42:00,652
lt's an arranged marriage.

1172
01:42:00,856 --> 01:42:02,847
You like me and l like your
father's background.

1173
01:42:03,259 --> 01:42:05,284
When there's no love in this,
how can it be a love marriage?

1174
01:42:05,494 --> 01:42:07,519
Then, what about my love
marriage ambition...

1175
01:42:08,664 --> 01:42:10,632
What should l do to fall in love?

1176
01:42:13,469 --> 01:42:17,371
The bell in your heart
must ring to fall in love.

1177
01:42:18,274 --> 01:42:19,434
Did l say it right?

1178
01:42:24,347 --> 01:42:26,110
Bell? Ring?

1179
01:42:52,241 --> 01:42:53,674
Do we need love?

1180
01:42:54,410 --> 01:42:56,776
We see hundreds of girls every day...

1181
01:43:01,717 --> 01:43:03,241
Seenu is right.

1182
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:08,151
Love is a feel...an accident...

1183
01:43:13,391 --> 01:43:14,858
Come in Bhavani!

1184
01:43:15,059 --> 01:43:18,222
How come you're here suddenly
without any intimation?

1185
01:43:18,429 --> 01:43:21,193
l gave you Seenu,
l'm here to take Shruthi.

1186
01:43:21,399 --> 01:43:26,029
You said it right but take her
after my daughter's marriage.

1187
01:43:26,237 --> 01:43:28,364
What if Seenu takes her
if Shruthi is here only?

1188
01:43:28,573 --> 01:43:32,009
Do you know whom you're suspecting?
My son-in-law!

1189
01:43:32,210 --> 01:43:36,010
My son-in-law is a diamond!
l don't want to argue with him.

1190
01:43:36,214 --> 01:43:39,274
Get the girl.
- Okay brother.

1191
01:43:39,617 --> 01:43:43,883
She appears to be a good girl,
take good care of her.

1192
01:43:44,088 --> 01:43:46,454
Brother, the girl is missing.

1193
01:43:48,126 --> 01:43:50,185
First see if Seenu is here or not.

1194
01:43:55,967 --> 01:43:57,298
Sir, son-in-law is also missing.

1195
01:43:57,502 --> 01:44:00,369
l told you but you said
he's a diamond.

1196
01:44:00,905 --> 01:44:02,532
He's up to some trick.

1197
01:44:16,154 --> 01:44:17,382
Where is the girl?
- Girl?

1198
01:44:17,588 --> 01:44:18,384
Which girl, father-in-law?

1199
01:44:18,589 --> 01:44:19,351
Where is the girl?

1200
01:44:19,557 --> 01:44:21,252
Which girl, father-in-law?

1201
01:44:23,394 --> 01:44:25,055
They're playing a game.

1202
01:44:27,098 --> 01:44:28,156
l found you !

1203
01:44:28,499 --> 01:44:30,296
Why did you bring a rifle?

1204
01:44:30,501 --> 01:44:35,165
Nothing dear, just to show it
to son-in-law, you go in.

1205
01:44:35,373 --> 01:44:36,931
Sandhya, go!

1206
01:44:41,979 --> 01:44:42,968
What's this?

1207
01:44:43,181 --> 01:44:45,411
l didn't search in bathroom.

1208
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:56,054
Tell me father-in-law,
what's the matter?

1209
01:44:56,260 --> 01:44:57,352
Nothing son-in-law!

1210
01:44:57,562 --> 01:44:59,621
You've come with a rifle and
Bhavani is here, what's going on?

1211
01:45:00,031 --> 01:45:01,521
l must know what's going on here?

1212
01:45:01,933 --> 01:45:04,299
What am l to say?
He came to take Shruthi.

1213
01:45:04,502 --> 01:45:06,595
Shruthi wasn't seen around.
You too weren't here.

1214
01:45:07,004 --> 01:45:10,940
That idiot said you took her away.
So l brought the rifle.

1215
01:45:11,142 --> 01:45:14,600
Will you believe if some damn
fool says anything, father-in-law?

1216
01:45:15,012 --> 01:45:17,480
l gave my love for your
powerful background,

1217
01:45:17,682 --> 01:45:20,651
and promised to marry
your daughter,

1218
01:45:21,052 --> 01:45:22,952
will you suspect me?

1219
01:45:25,022 --> 01:45:27,991
No, since you don't trust,
l don't want to live anymore.

1220
01:45:28,192 --> 01:45:32,686
Fire me father-in-law!
- No son-in-law!

1221
01:45:34,499 --> 01:45:38,196
Have you gone mad?
Just missed death !

1222
01:45:38,403 --> 01:45:40,564
lt was all because of this mad man.

1223
01:45:40,772 --> 01:45:43,332
l know one truth,
you don't trust me.

1224
01:45:43,541 --> 01:45:46,032
So send Shruthi with him.

1225
01:45:47,445 --> 01:45:49,538
Please don't think l don't
trust you, son-in-law.

1226
01:45:49,747 --> 01:45:52,147
Since you don't trust me,
send Shruthi with him.

1227
01:45:52,350 --> 01:45:54,113
l trust you fully, son-in-law!

1228
01:45:54,318 --> 01:45:56,980
Since you don't trust me,
send Shruthi with him.

1229
01:45:57,188 --> 01:46:00,157
l trust you as much as
l love my daughter,

1230
01:46:00,358 --> 01:46:03,486
so Shruthi will stay here
till your marriage.

1231
01:46:04,095 --> 01:46:07,258
lf anyone dares change it,
l'll rip out their skin.

1232
01:46:07,465 --> 01:46:10,263
Son-in-law, don't make it a big issue.

1233
01:46:16,707 --> 01:46:20,734
Rajanna, l'll stay here till
this marriage.

1234
01:46:21,179 --> 01:46:23,374
Okay stay!

1235
01:46:23,815 --> 01:46:27,717
Will you take her as and
when you get mood?

1236
01:46:28,119 --> 01:46:30,713
l'll stay here and see
how you'd take her.

1237
01:46:31,389 --> 01:46:36,725
lf you're there and l take Shruthi,
there's no kick in it,

1238
01:46:37,128 --> 01:46:38,652
in Rajanna's house,
as you watch me,

1239
01:46:39,063 --> 01:46:40,223
when everyone is watching me,

1240
01:46:40,431 --> 01:46:44,265
l'll take Shruthi
only then l'm a real man ! Fun !

1241
01:46:47,805 --> 01:46:49,534
Did l go over the board?

1242
01:46:58,483 --> 01:47:03,216
Am l a middle class girl?
Will you leave m midway?

1243
01:47:04,155 --> 01:47:11,220
No use in loving you,
no sweet nothings or kisses,

1244
01:47:16,801 --> 01:47:20,100
This isn't like romance but rape!

1245
01:47:20,304 --> 01:47:21,737
Anyway it's after marriage only.

1246
01:47:22,139 --> 01:47:23,333
ls it done only after marriage?

1247
01:47:23,541 --> 01:47:29,241
What's this marriage?
Bhavani too is here!

1248
01:47:29,447 --> 01:47:32,143
You beat them black and blue,
can't you take me with you?

1249
01:47:32,350 --> 01:47:36,446
lt isn't easy to take you away from
Rajanna's house as from Bhavani's house.

1250
01:47:36,654 --> 01:47:39,680
So l beat Rajanna's men to gain their
confidence and entered the place.

1251
01:47:40,124 --> 01:47:43,093
l myself don't know when and
how l'll take you with me.

1252
01:47:43,294 --> 01:47:44,420
You be ready always!

1253
01:47:44,629 --> 01:47:45,755
Promise on me.

1254
01:47:47,498 --> 01:47:49,557
l promise on my father
whom l love the most.

1255
01:47:51,869 --> 01:47:54,463
l was worried about
address change,

1256
01:47:54,672 --> 01:47:56,162
he found a very good party!

1257
01:47:56,374 --> 01:47:58,205
Come, our fates too will change.

1258
01:47:58,476 --> 01:47:59,670
What a beautiful bungalow!

1259
01:47:59,877 --> 01:48:03,244
How beautiful my brother-in-law
would be then !

1260
01:48:03,447 --> 01:48:05,210
Where's my brother-in-law?

1261
01:48:05,850 --> 01:48:07,340
What's this cry?

1262
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:09,577
lt's death cry!

1263
01:48:13,624 --> 01:48:15,558
Brother, our kinsman.

1264
01:48:17,228 --> 01:48:19,253
Who is Seenu's father among you?

1265
01:48:20,364 --> 01:48:21,695
Give me that knife.

1266
01:48:28,406 --> 01:48:30,567
l'm your favourite.

1267
01:48:32,376 --> 01:48:35,573
What a great son you've!
How smart he is!

1268
01:48:35,780 --> 01:48:38,840
l've placed my entire clan
at your son's feet.

1269
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:40,740
Where's my daughter-in-law?

1270
01:48:40,952 --> 01:48:42,351
Father!
- Come dear.

1271
01:48:42,553 --> 01:48:43,850
Brother-in-law, your daughter-in-law.

1272
01:48:44,255 --> 01:48:47,418
Father, cable is coming properly,
call him and break his bones.

1273
01:48:47,758 --> 01:48:50,226
Your daughter-in-law is very violent.
- Perfect match for my son.

1274
01:48:50,428 --> 01:48:52,521
l'll do it.
Your father-in-law is here.

1275
01:48:52,730 --> 01:48:53,697
Take his blessings, dear.

1276
01:48:53,898 --> 01:48:58,460
No way! He's very short!
l'll not take his blessings.

1277
01:48:58,669 --> 01:49:03,333
He's your father-in-law,
take his blessings, dear.- Okay.

1278
01:49:04,408 --> 01:49:05,875
Who is he?
Appears like my dad.

1279
01:49:07,211 --> 01:49:09,179
You're like pure gold.

1280
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:10,904
What are you doing here
without any intimation?

1281
01:49:11,315 --> 01:49:12,213
Please come in.

1282
01:49:12,416 --> 01:49:15,442
Why should l come?
Will you marry without telling me?

1283
01:49:15,653 --> 01:49:18,417
He's a gentleman,
so he brought us in AC coach.

1284
01:49:18,623 --> 01:49:19,954
Did you bring them, father-in-law?

1285
01:49:20,358 --> 01:49:22,189
Yes son-in-law, marriage is nearing fast.

1286
01:49:22,393 --> 01:49:24,384
Please come inside a minute, dad.
- l'll not come.

1287
01:49:24,862 --> 01:49:29,231
He's calling so politely,
there must be a reason, go.

1288
01:49:31,235 --> 01:49:32,862
What's this house?
- What a father-in-law?

1289
01:49:33,270 --> 01:49:35,636
What a daughter?
- Everything is confused!

1290
01:49:41,512 --> 01:49:42,444
My dad!

1291
01:49:43,414 --> 01:49:46,440
Get up dear.
You're like an angel.

1292
01:49:46,651 --> 01:49:49,211
Who is this girl?
- The girl l'm going to marry.

1293
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:52,617
Who is that girl then?
- The girl who is marrying me.

1294
01:49:53,791 --> 01:49:57,488
Confused!
- To clear your confusion.

1295
01:50:07,905 --> 01:50:10,840
Entire Warangal must rock!

1296
01:50:11,509 --> 01:50:12,339
That's the matter, dad.

1297
01:50:12,543 --> 01:50:14,773
l myself don't know when
l'll go away with Shruthi.

1298
01:50:14,979 --> 01:50:17,607
As you'd come here
without my knowledge,

1299
01:50:17,815 --> 01:50:18,338
escape from here without
anyone's knowledge.

1300
01:50:18,549 --> 01:50:20,449
You know about Rajanna, right?

1301
01:50:25,790 --> 01:50:28,884
l don't get anything.
- l got it.

1302
01:50:29,293 --> 01:50:31,784
We came searching our death.

1303
01:50:31,996 --> 01:50:34,487
We must escape before
Seenu escapes.

1304
01:50:34,699 --> 01:50:36,826
Do you think Seenu would
do as he says?

1305
01:50:37,034 --> 01:50:39,525
From his childhood,
he has no sentiments,

1306
01:50:39,737 --> 01:50:41,932
He'll not only elopes
with Shruthi,

1307
01:50:42,339 --> 01:50:44,637
if necessary he'll take
Rajanna's daughter too.

1308
01:51:17,808 --> 01:51:21,972
l'm yours anytime and anywhere...

1309
01:51:22,379 --> 01:51:26,543
Katrina, my treasure trove of beauty...

1310
01:51:26,717 --> 01:51:31,381
Whenever and wherever one more time...

1311
01:51:31,589 --> 01:51:35,855
Dreamwood and love statue
is great and sensational...

1312
01:51:36,060 --> 01:51:40,360
lt's making me lose my fuse...

1313
01:51:40,564 --> 01:51:42,725
This silly romance is
full of colour...

1314
01:51:43,033 --> 01:51:47,402
Bite me like the hornet...

1315
01:51:47,605 --> 01:51:52,508
Make a tattoo on me, hornet...

1316
01:52:18,702 --> 01:52:23,935
Shall l date moonlight?
Shall l promise strawberry?

1317
01:52:24,141 --> 01:52:28,134
Shall l give mind blocking kiss?
Shall l give myself to you?

1318
01:52:28,546 --> 01:52:32,880
Looking at your sensational body
my youth is yearning for a lip lock...

1319
01:52:33,083 --> 01:52:37,417
5 star dinner is ready, front door
is open, give me a French kiss quickly...

1320
01:52:37,621 --> 01:52:42,354
We are cool and
rocking as a pair...

1321
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:48,726
lt's whistle blowing
and sensational...

1322
01:53:39,783 --> 01:53:44,117
You're an ultra modern Anarkali
and my lovely Masakali...

1323
01:53:44,521 --> 01:53:48,719
l'm your Mango jelly,
taste me again and again...

1324
01:53:48,926 --> 01:53:52,953
Your ravishing waist is
making my lip hot...

1325
01:53:53,163 --> 01:53:55,222
Looking at your juicy muscles
and powerful fiery eyes...

1326
01:53:55,633 --> 01:53:57,533
l'm taken over by
passionate desires...

1327
01:53:57,735 --> 01:54:02,195
Pizza is there and Pasta too,
shall l have both at a time?

1328
01:54:02,606 --> 01:54:08,943
Shall l rock them with
my jet speed?

1329
01:54:46,951 --> 01:54:51,012
Come...come...
- Are you quicker than me?

1330
01:54:54,224 --> 01:54:56,522
Come...come...

1331
01:55:05,169 --> 01:55:06,602
Look, how l got you out!

1332
01:55:06,804 --> 01:55:08,829
What about your father's plight then?

1333
01:55:09,039 --> 01:55:10,768
Mad girl, they're faster than me.

1334
01:55:10,975 --> 01:55:13,773
Your entire family is smart!

1335
01:55:14,745 --> 01:55:15,712
That's your greatness!

1336
01:55:21,051 --> 01:55:22,780
lf they see us...

1337
01:55:28,826 --> 01:55:30,191
Start the vehicles!

1338
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:54,877
l'm telling you again...in temple!

1339
01:55:55,085 --> 01:55:57,645
ln front of my Vinay's
father Lord Shiva!

1340
01:55:57,855 --> 01:56:00,949
Sandhya is my wife
every time l'm born as man !

1341
01:56:01,692 --> 01:56:04,024
Can't he tell this in home?
Why to come this far?

1342
01:56:04,228 --> 01:56:08,028
You could get the silly doubt
why not at home why come this far?

1343
01:56:08,232 --> 01:56:13,795
lf Sandhya sees us talking for a minute,
she may not be able to bear it.

1344
01:56:14,972 --> 01:56:18,100
Already Bhavani is creating differences
between me and my father-in-law.

1345
01:56:20,377 --> 01:56:22,641
Even if he sees us coming here,

1346
01:56:22,846 --> 01:56:26,009
he'll not follow us!
He trusts me so much !

1347
01:56:26,216 --> 01:56:28,741
He trusts me blindly!

1348
01:56:30,721 --> 01:56:32,348
How am l...

1349
01:56:33,791 --> 01:56:38,751
Son-in-law is coming,
it won't be good if he sees us, go.

1350
01:56:40,130 --> 01:56:41,893
Father-in-law! You...? Here...?

1351
01:56:42,099 --> 01:56:44,659
Today is Monday, Lord Shiva's temple!

1352
01:56:44,902 --> 01:56:46,267
Today is Tuesday, father-in-law.

1353
01:56:46,870 --> 01:56:49,839
Don't you know days too?
Why did you say it's Monday?

1354
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:52,702
ls that the reason?
Did Bhavani say anything?

1355
01:56:52,910 --> 01:56:55,378
Why would l listen to him again?

1356
01:56:55,779 --> 01:56:59,647
You didn't hear me talking
to Shruthi, right?

1357
01:57:01,452 --> 01:57:04,888
Okay you heard us, but please
keep it secret from Sandhya.

1358
01:57:05,089 --> 01:57:09,082
Because she can't bear this!
- Son-in-law!

1359
01:57:17,935 --> 01:57:21,200
Today changed the vehicle,
tomorrow heart will change.

1360
01:57:21,405 --> 01:57:23,100
You start the vehicle!

1361
01:57:25,742 --> 01:57:28,336
Don't stare at me! l'm scared!
- Are you my friend?

1362
01:57:28,879 --> 01:57:32,212
l'll cut of my friendship!
- You will!

1363
01:57:32,449 --> 01:57:35,418
Since l don't have your support,
l planned it myself,

1364
01:57:35,819 --> 01:57:38,344
will you reverse it in the
last moment?

1365
01:57:41,091 --> 01:57:44,857
My luck your father Shiva was there
and l could manage to escape.

1366
01:57:45,062 --> 01:57:47,257
Daddy, you too got cheated by him!

1367
01:57:47,464 --> 01:57:49,364
Can't you understand
how serious the matter is?

1368
01:57:49,766 --> 01:57:51,757
Give me an idea!

1369
01:57:55,339 --> 01:57:56,738
What Sandhya?

1370
01:57:56,940 --> 01:57:57,964
What you said is right!

1371
01:57:58,175 --> 01:58:00,143
What did l tell you?
What was right?

1372
01:58:00,344 --> 01:58:04,212
Bell of my heart rang!

1373
01:58:04,982 --> 01:58:06,381
Bell rang?!
- Yes!

1374
01:58:06,783 --> 01:58:09,183
When? Where? Who?

1375
01:58:09,453 --> 01:58:11,421
He!

1376
01:58:17,761 --> 01:58:20,787
He? How?

1377
01:58:21,365 --> 01:58:23,424
How means...

1378
01:58:55,899 --> 01:58:58,129
He too has stammer like me!

1379
01:59:01,171 --> 01:59:06,473
Do you stammer?
- Yes, l managed well with you.

1380
01:59:06,877 --> 01:59:11,109
l stammer whenever l'm happy or sad!

1381
01:59:22,059 --> 01:59:24,323
l thought something and
you did something else!

1382
01:59:25,862 --> 01:59:28,353
The story isn't my eloping with Shruthi?

1383
01:59:28,565 --> 01:59:31,227
Uniting Bhavani and Sandhya!

1384
01:59:31,435 --> 01:59:33,369
You're in for good time, boy!

1385
01:59:37,207 --> 01:59:40,973
Sandhya, love has entered your life.

1386
01:59:42,079 --> 01:59:43,444
ls it really love?

1387
01:59:45,082 --> 01:59:48,313
Did your bell ring?
- lt did but...

1388
01:59:48,518 --> 01:59:50,918
No ifs and buts!

1389
01:59:51,121 --> 01:59:54,284
But it'll take sometime
to know it's love.

1390
01:59:55,058 --> 01:59:57,458
What should l do now?
- No need to do anything.

1391
01:59:57,861 --> 02:00:00,489
The bell will ring continuously.

1392
02:00:01,531 --> 02:00:06,195
Till this is confirmed as love,
let this be between us only.

1393
02:00:08,939 --> 02:00:14,571
Bhavani, your love story has begun
to turn your love story.

1394
02:00:17,981 --> 02:00:19,949
l'm unable to squeeze juice.

1395
02:00:26,089 --> 02:00:28,250
Brother is busy, so l helped him.

1396
02:00:29,259 --> 02:00:32,160
No need of your boss to exercise,
he must develop brain.

1397
02:00:32,362 --> 02:00:35,854
Girls are falling for brain
than for brawn.

1398
02:00:36,066 --> 02:00:38,330
For example, me!

1399
02:00:38,535 --> 02:00:41,163
lf he doesn't go now,
l'll break your head with dumb bell.

1400
02:00:41,371 --> 02:00:42,463
Go, l beg you, please go.

1401
02:00:42,673 --> 02:00:45,506
l'll have lemon juice, be on it.

1402
02:00:53,550 --> 02:00:55,347
She has started ogling him!

1403
02:01:01,224 --> 02:01:05,092
l must turn this situation
into my favour. How?

1404
02:01:06,530 --> 02:01:09,226
Bye Chintu, l've to run an errand.
- Go!

1405
02:01:09,433 --> 02:01:11,128
Squeeze well!

1406
02:01:11,335 --> 02:01:14,395
Go away!
- Will you be here only?

1407
02:01:27,250 --> 02:01:29,912
He has planned something,
boss, he's running!

1408
02:01:58,014 --> 02:01:59,379
What's that noise?

1409
02:01:59,583 --> 02:02:03,144
Sir, Nicaraguan and
Tabu are in pool!

1410
02:02:36,086 --> 02:02:38,281
ls it love?
- Go Seenu !

1411
02:02:38,488 --> 02:02:40,513
l'll go, you don't need me anymore.

1412
02:02:40,724 --> 02:02:44,160
You'll tell your father that you
want Bhavani and not Seenu.

1413
02:02:45,295 --> 02:02:48,458
l don't have a love story in my life.

1414
02:02:49,366 --> 02:02:51,766
Why did you say so?

1415
02:02:52,502 --> 02:02:54,766
Have you forgotten it?
What did you tell me?

1416
02:02:55,172 --> 02:02:59,074
Did you say perfect love is from
two sides not just one side?

1417
02:02:59,509 --> 02:03:02,103
Did l?
Over smartness!

1418
02:03:02,312 --> 02:03:06,112
Bhavani is here for Shruthi.
How can he love me?

1419
02:03:06,316 --> 02:03:09,114
He will because his love for Shruthi
isn't true love.

1420
02:03:09,319 --> 02:03:10,752
He wants avenge me.

1421
02:03:11,588 --> 02:03:13,613
Today you both fell into water tank,

1422
02:03:14,024 --> 02:03:16,549
you both got closer,
rubbing your wet bodies,

1423
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:18,523
l'm sure his heart would've
skipped a beat.

1424
02:03:19,262 --> 02:03:20,422
Really?

1425
02:03:20,730 --> 02:03:25,258
ln a day or two, he'll come to you
and express his love.

1426
02:03:27,070 --> 02:03:31,234
When you say this l feel its true.
Promise!

1427
02:03:32,209 --> 02:03:35,235
l promise on your father
who loves you the most. Be happy.

1428
02:03:35,445 --> 02:03:40,815
Keep it between us till
he expresses his love to me.

1429
02:03:42,719 --> 02:03:46,678
Should Bhavani come to you
and express his love?

1430
02:03:47,457 --> 02:03:48,583
How will he express it?

1431
02:03:56,597 --> 02:03:58,326
Boss, look there!

1432
02:04:15,583 --> 02:04:16,675
What happened now?

1433
02:04:17,084 --> 02:04:20,212
l told you boss, that day she changed
the vehicle, now changed heart!

1434
02:04:20,421 --> 02:04:23,413
Don't waste time, just follow her.

1435
02:04:26,427 --> 02:04:30,090
Stop it!
Don't talk to me about Seenu.

1436
02:04:30,264 --> 02:04:32,994
He's a villain in hero's garb.

1437
02:04:34,135 --> 02:04:36,103
He made me believe he loves me,

1438
02:04:36,304 --> 02:04:37,669
seeing Rajanna's vast property,

1439
02:04:38,072 --> 02:04:40,404
he changed his mind
to marry his daughter,

1440
02:04:40,641 --> 02:04:44,236
Poor man ! l never realised
Bhavani's love,

1441
02:04:44,445 --> 02:04:45,742
and mistook him as the villain.

1442
02:04:46,147 --> 02:04:50,413
lnfact Bhavani is hero in
a villain's garb.

1443
02:04:50,618 --> 02:04:55,180
What? Do you want me to
tell Bhavani that l love him?

1444
02:04:55,656 --> 02:04:58,454
Till now l rejected him,
if l suddenly say l love you,

1445
02:04:58,659 --> 02:05:00,251
how can he believe me?

1446
02:05:00,628 --> 02:05:04,394
ln a secluded and lonely time,
in a romantic time,

1447
02:05:04,599 --> 02:05:07,090
if Bhavani expresses his love to me,

1448
02:05:07,301 --> 02:05:09,201
l'm yearning to hear it.

1449
02:05:37,832 --> 02:05:39,231
She has agreed to marry
my son and then...

1450
02:05:39,433 --> 02:05:41,162
This is known as closeness.

1451
02:05:42,637 --> 02:05:45,162
This is to much !
- lndeed!

1452
02:05:54,715 --> 02:05:58,242
lf Rajanna sees them,
he'll rip us all apart!

1453
02:06:05,860 --> 02:06:09,227
Hey you thief! Are you saying
sorry because they'd seen us?

1454
02:06:09,430 --> 02:06:13,332
lf not l'd have told l love you.

1455
02:06:15,569 --> 02:06:16,763
Okay?

1456
02:06:17,338 --> 02:06:18,532
Okay, Seenu !

1457
02:06:22,243 --> 02:06:24,143
Did you see the chemistry
between them?

1458
02:06:24,345 --> 02:06:26,540
lt's not good for us to be here.

1459
02:06:30,651 --> 02:06:32,482
Your plan is fantastic!

1460
02:06:33,554 --> 02:06:37,081
There's no match for your brain.

1461
02:06:39,260 --> 02:06:41,387
Why is he here?

1462
02:06:42,129 --> 02:06:44,222
Who is he?
- Rajanna's brother-in-law.

1463
02:06:44,432 --> 02:06:46,525
lntelligence officer, he's too smart!

1464
02:06:46,734 --> 02:06:47,701
What if anyone is over smart?

1465
02:06:47,902 --> 02:06:49,267
l'll make you lick ground!

1466
02:06:49,470 --> 02:06:51,233
l'm...
- You're Seenu's friend.

1467
02:06:51,439 --> 02:06:52,531
You've problem with second family.
- For me?

1468
02:06:52,740 --> 02:06:54,139
Not you him!

1469
02:06:56,444 --> 02:07:00,312
Comb every inch of the home and
every male and female!

1470
02:07:01,515 --> 02:07:07,454
What are you searching
here, brother-in-law?

1471
02:07:07,822 --> 02:07:09,517
Quick!

1472
02:07:12,860 --> 02:07:15,522
Are you fine, uncle?
- God bless you dear.

1473
02:07:33,981 --> 02:07:37,280
Why are you giving a paper
in a marriage house?

1474
02:07:37,485 --> 02:07:40,943
There's a marriage in
my brother-in-law's house,

1475
02:07:41,355 --> 02:07:43,585
so l've taken the responsibility
of the security.

1476
02:07:44,425 --> 02:07:45,414
Why are you rushing away?

1477
02:07:45,626 --> 02:07:48,322
Why don't you meet son-in-law's family?

1478
02:07:48,529 --> 02:07:49,791
He's...
- Son-in-law!

1479
02:07:49,997 --> 02:07:51,658
Son-in-law's father...
son-in-law's uncle...his friend.

1480
02:07:51,866 --> 02:07:53,800
Son-in-law's enemy...
he wants that girl,

1481
02:07:54,001 --> 02:07:56,492
that girl wants son-in-law,
you want son-in-law!

1482
02:07:57,505 --> 02:07:58,631
How could you tell so perfectly?

1483
02:07:58,839 --> 02:08:02,798
l'll scan with my eyes
and tell their character.

1484
02:08:04,211 --> 02:08:06,839
Hey you, meet son-in-law and go.

1485
02:08:07,248 --> 02:08:09,808
Son-in-law!
- Did you call me, father-in-law?

1486
02:08:14,422 --> 02:08:17,619
My brother-in-law Avataram,
that's my son-in-law.

1487
02:08:17,825 --> 02:08:19,349
Greetings sir.

1488
02:08:19,460 --> 02:08:20,950
l'll scan him!

1489
02:08:27,768 --> 02:08:30,430
Problem isn't in the house but in him.

1490
02:08:30,638 --> 02:08:33,232
You're a crook!
- You're right!

1491
02:08:34,608 --> 02:08:36,872
l'll expose your true character.

1492
02:08:37,278 --> 02:08:38,302

1493
02:08:38,979 --> 02:08:42,312
We've to catch the flight sir.
- You catch the flight.

l've to catch a man here.

1495
02:08:47,455 --> 02:08:48,513
Are you that smart?

1496
02:08:48,722 --> 02:08:51,316
lsn't my son-in-law like a diamond?

1497
02:08:51,525 --> 02:08:55,928
Does he appear like that to you?
l'll unmask him in 24 hours.

1498
02:09:00,534 --> 02:09:03,970
Come immediately to the corridor
behind the balcony.

02:09:08,476 --> 02:09:09,875

Please see!
- Wait...

1502
02:09:22,957 --> 02:09:24,948
You got caught, Seenu !

1503
02:09:25,059 --> 02:09:27,789
l've caught you red handed
with your lover Shruthi.

1504
02:09:30,064 --> 02:09:31,429
Fine?

1505
02:09:34,301 --> 02:09:35,768
Our girl!

1506
02:09:36,670 --> 02:09:38,661
l thought he was a crook!

1507
02:09:39,607 --> 02:09:40,938
Am l the crook?

1508
02:09:41,542 --> 02:09:42,474
Where is he?

1509
02:09:45,312 --> 02:09:46,404
Why did you call me urgently?

1510
02:09:46,614 --> 02:09:51,916
That is...how am l to tell you...

1511
02:09:52,486 --> 02:09:54,681
l can't hold anymore.

1512

1513
02:09:56,991 --> 02:09:59,050
What happened?
- What had happened was...

1514
02:10:06,967 --> 02:10:09,595
Just now you kissed her,
again so quickly!

1515
02:10:09,837 --> 02:10:12,067
Can our girl bear his speed?

1516
02:10:12,706 --> 02:10:14,970
Seenu, please leave her.

1517
02:10:15,376 --> 02:10:20,473
l beg you...she may die!
Stop...you...stop it!

1518
02:10:22,917 --> 02:10:28,514
Oh no! l'm not a crook,
you're a crook!

1519
02:10:28,722 --> 02:10:29,882
Go Seenu...

1520
02:10:37,998 --> 02:10:40,558
Why did we come here, daddy?

1521
02:10:40,801 --> 02:10:44,669
To kidnap Rajanna's son-in-law Seenu.

1522
02:10:44,872 --> 02:10:46,032
Kidnap?

1523
02:10:51,178 --> 02:10:53,146
Not a plan is working out.

1524
02:10:56,684 --> 02:10:58,879
Who is Seenu here?

1525
02:11:00,154 --> 02:11:00,984
Me!

1526
02:11:01,956 --> 02:11:03,651
Do it.
- Why?

1527
02:11:03,857 --> 02:11:05,552
Aren't you Rajanna's son-in-law?

1528
02:11:05,759 --> 02:11:08,660
l'm not Rajanna's son-in-law,
it's Bhavani.

1529
02:11:15,636 --> 02:11:16,728
Where are you going?

1530
02:11:19,607 --> 02:11:20,801
How will you do it?

1531
02:11:22,876 --> 02:11:23,934
Like this!

1532
02:11:25,112 --> 02:11:26,170
You pig!

1533
02:11:32,019 --> 02:11:34,078
l'm asking you ignorantly,

1534
02:11:34,488 --> 02:11:38,015
Seenu is kissing Shruthi
and also Sandhya.

1535
02:11:39,226 --> 02:11:40,955
He's beyond my scanning!

1536
02:11:57,778 --> 02:11:59,541
Not me! There!

1537
02:12:11,759 --> 02:12:14,057
She kissed him and
gave a flower to this man.

1538
02:12:14,662 --> 02:12:17,756
Not only Seenu, she's also a cheat!

1539
02:12:26,640 --> 02:12:28,198
Who is it?

1540
02:12:57,104 --> 02:13:01,040
Sandhya dear!
Open the door please!

1541
02:13:06,847 --> 02:13:10,510
l...l...
- Don't get tensed!

1542
02:13:11,785 --> 02:13:13,013
l'll manage it.

1543
02:13:14,555 --> 02:13:17,683
Go under the cot!

1544
02:13:18,625 --> 02:13:19,148
Go!

1545
02:13:22,029 --> 02:13:25,658
l thought only they were crooks
but our girl too!

1546
02:13:25,866 --> 02:13:27,595
Total crooks!

1547
02:13:27,801 --> 02:13:31,259
What's that noise, dear?
- Nothing father.

1548
02:13:31,638 --> 02:13:33,663
l feel someone is inside.

1549
02:13:33,874 --> 02:13:34,932
Nobody came inside, father.

1550
02:13:35,142 --> 02:13:35,904
Why did you raise an
alarm, father-in-law?

1551
02:13:36,110 --> 02:13:38,977
Nothing son-in-law, l felt like
someone entered this room.

1552
02:13:39,179 --> 02:13:41,113
Some one entered? Who is it?

1553
02:13:41,315 --> 02:13:42,976
How dare he enters
my future wife's room!

1554
02:13:43,183 --> 02:13:44,912
lf l find him...

1555
02:13:46,153 --> 02:13:48,246
Nobody is in bathroom, father-in-law.

1556
02:13:50,057 --> 02:13:51,888
l'm sure he would be in
the cupboard.

1557
02:13:55,796 --> 02:13:58,321
There's nobody in the cupboard
too, father-in-law.

1558
02:13:58,732 --> 02:14:01,030
lf you've any doubt,
check it yourself.

1559
02:14:01,235 --> 02:14:02,862
lf you check that's enough, come.

1560
02:14:05,272 --> 02:14:05,966
Where could he be?

1561
02:14:06,173 --> 02:14:08,266
Did you check under the cot?

1562
02:14:10,944 --> 02:14:14,937
Be careful dear, marriage is nearing,
thieves may enter!

1563
02:14:17,017 --> 02:14:18,712
l got you boy! l'll show you !

1564
02:14:18,919 --> 02:14:19,715
Father-in-law!

1565
02:14:20,587 --> 02:14:22,179
What son-in-law?

1566
02:14:22,656 --> 02:14:24,021
There's no one under the cot too!

1567
02:14:24,224 --> 02:14:25,248
Do you've to shout for it?

1568
02:14:25,659 --> 02:14:28,628
Didn't you shout now?
How can anyone enter when l'm here?

1569
02:14:28,829 --> 02:14:30,023
l'm brave because you're here.

1570
02:14:30,230 --> 02:14:32,755
You go to sleep, l'll take care.

1571
02:14:35,402 --> 02:14:39,031
Entering room,
going under the cot...

1572
02:14:40,040 --> 02:14:42,941
Would he express his love to me?

1573
02:14:45,078 --> 02:14:48,809
He'll thank you now and
express his love later.

1574
02:14:49,016 --> 02:14:49,948
You're in a hurry!

1575
02:14:50,217 --> 02:14:51,912
l'll give him a shock.

1576
02:14:55,155 --> 02:14:57,180
My father has left, come out.

1577
02:14:57,724 --> 02:14:59,316
Come out quickly!

1578
02:15:02,830 --> 02:15:04,058
Have you got anything to tell me?

1579
02:15:11,438 --> 02:15:13,406
Seenu is always right.

1580
02:15:15,876 --> 02:15:19,676
Even an lntelligence officer
like me got confused.

1581
02:15:20,147 --> 02:15:25,084
No use! l must know
everything first hand!

1582
02:15:29,656 --> 02:15:31,123
They've started arrangements too!

1583
02:15:33,894 --> 02:15:37,762
lt's my Sandhya's marriage,
get going fast!

1584
02:15:37,965 --> 02:15:39,830
ls everything going on fine?

1585
02:15:40,767 --> 02:15:42,758
Why is your face dull, priest?
What's the matter?

1586
02:15:42,970 --> 02:15:45,939
Brother, l'm here!
Where is your son-in-law?

1587
02:15:46,139 --> 02:15:48,869
He's right next to you
and asking me. He there!

1588
02:15:49,076 --> 02:15:54,878
Oh ! The boy looks great!
His cheeks are very tender!

1589
02:15:55,082 --> 02:15:57,016
Stop that and make arrangements.

1590
02:15:57,217 --> 02:15:58,980
l'm here for that only.

1591
02:15:59,186 --> 02:16:00,210
Come ladies.

1592
02:16:00,954 --> 02:16:02,148
l don't understand.

1593
02:16:02,356 --> 02:16:04,449
Are you tensed, Seenu?

1594
02:16:05,459 --> 02:16:07,825
Are you worried because Bhavani
hasn't expressed his love to me?

1595
02:16:08,161 --> 02:16:09,389
He'll express it.

1596
02:16:11,131 --> 02:16:13,725
l've complete confidence on you.

1597
02:16:19,406 --> 02:16:21,431
Do you've it?
l don't have confidence in myself.

1598
02:16:23,243 --> 02:16:24,369
Do you want this is?

1599
02:16:25,312 --> 02:16:27,143
Not a cell phone but your love tale!

1600
02:16:27,347 --> 02:16:31,750
l'm sure it's love and it'll take
time to know if it's love.

1601
02:16:32,352 --> 02:16:35,287
He'll come to you and express
his love to you.

1602
02:16:36,023 --> 02:16:37,718
Your plan is great!

1603
02:16:38,759 --> 02:16:40,090
What's your problem?

1604
02:16:41,428 --> 02:16:46,388
The dirty world married off
pigeon with the cage...

1605
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:49,360
What's the connection between
this song and the situation?

1606
02:16:50,203 --> 02:16:51,966
There is!

1607
02:16:52,506 --> 02:16:56,169
When madam was walking
down the steps...

1608
02:16:58,445 --> 02:17:00,310
Madam is very beautiful!

1609
02:17:03,050 --> 02:17:04,244
How dare you ogle my daughter!

1610
02:17:04,451 --> 02:17:06,715
l'm sparing because you've been
loyal to me since childhood.

1611
02:17:06,920 --> 02:17:09,980
Bloody rogue! Go!

1612
02:17:13,093 --> 02:17:16,153
Don't goons have a heart?
We too have feelings.

1613
02:17:16,363 --> 02:17:21,767
l'd wished that Rajanna must get
a worse goon than me as son-in-law.

1614
02:17:21,969 --> 02:17:23,994
You entered the scene.
l was very happy.

1615
02:17:24,171 --> 02:17:28,164
l was extremely happy
for setting up Bhavani.

1616
02:17:29,142 --> 02:17:31,872
lf you don't fix Sandhya's marriage
with Bhavani,

1617
02:17:32,079 --> 02:17:34,775
l'll give this cell to Rajanna.

1618
02:17:35,449 --> 02:17:38,213
You'll do it, you'll fix their marriage.

1619
02:17:38,418 --> 02:17:40,113
You will do it.

1620
02:17:40,320 --> 02:17:45,917
ls it my sin or curse?

1621
02:17:46,126 --> 02:17:48,424
T-shirt is great, Chintu.

1622
02:17:50,364 --> 02:17:55,324
Firs time l'm seeing confusion
in you instead of confidence.

1623
02:17:57,104 --> 02:17:59,197
Your marriage with Sandhya is fixed.

1624
02:17:59,406 --> 02:18:01,533
Even if you wish to take Shruthi,
she'll not come.

1625
02:18:01,942 --> 02:18:04,308
Do you know why?
Shruthi loves me.

1626
02:18:06,346 --> 02:18:08,906
Did you say l love you to Shruthi?

1627
02:18:09,883 --> 02:18:10,907
No!

1628
02:18:11,118 --> 02:18:12,915
Did Shruthi say l love you with you?

1629
02:18:13,954 --> 02:18:14,943
No!

1630
02:18:15,188 --> 02:18:17,053
Why do you need this shirt and scarf?

1631
02:18:17,257 --> 02:18:20,988
First go, tell l love you to Shruthi,
come back to tell me her reaction.

1632
02:18:25,565 --> 02:18:28,193
l'll tell her l love you.

1633
02:18:29,302 --> 02:18:30,826
ln a secluded and lonely time...

1634
02:18:39,846 --> 02:18:41,837
Real love story is ours.

1635
02:18:42,082 --> 02:18:44,209
He came between us like an hurdle.

1636
02:18:44,451 --> 02:18:48,444
lt's my mistake for not
being romantic with you.

1637
02:18:48,989 --> 02:18:50,479
Now l'll tell you..

1638
02:18:52,959 --> 02:18:54,859
Who is it?
Shruthi or Sandhya?

1639
02:19:02,502 --> 02:19:03,594
Leave me!

1640
02:19:17,050 --> 02:19:20,850
Actually l can't express my love
easily like others,

1641
02:19:21,054 --> 02:19:24,546
like Mahesh Babu in the film 'Athadu',

1642
02:19:25,125 --> 02:19:26,319
l too talk very little,

1643
02:19:27,094 --> 02:19:30,552
l'll express my love in one word!

1644
02:19:45,479 --> 02:19:47,174
l've told what l wanted to say!

1645
02:19:47,380 --> 02:19:50,679
lf you want to say anything,
l'll wait downstairs.

1646
02:19:55,288 --> 02:19:56,550
What else can l say?

1647
02:20:17,377 --> 02:20:20,642
Why are you running happily
around, my dear?

1648
02:20:21,047 --> 02:20:22,207
What happened, dear?

1649
02:20:22,415 --> 02:20:26,044
Father, my life is full of love!

1650
02:20:26,253 --> 02:20:27,049
What's it, dear?

1651
02:20:35,262 --> 02:20:42,134
Handsome smart young man !

1652
02:20:45,672 --> 02:20:54,580
He taught me
what is love and romance...

1653
02:20:56,716 --> 02:21:06,148
Love is intoxicating...
that intoxication is funny...

1654
02:21:14,568 --> 02:21:18,163
Love is gone...
that love is gone...

1655
02:21:24,411 --> 02:21:28,108
Fell in love...
l've fallen in love now...

1656
02:21:30,584 --> 02:21:45,124
Wedding bells are ringing...

1657
02:21:46,766 --> 02:21:50,031
Love or marriage,
everything is your grace...

1658
02:21:50,237 --> 02:21:53,138
O girl, l like your song and dance...

1659
02:21:53,340 --> 02:21:56,503
Auspicious time to unite
two hearts has come...

1660
02:21:56,710 --> 02:21:59,702
Bringing happiness to
rant the skies...

1661
02:22:00,113 --> 02:22:05,210
l'll watch you from a distance
and talk to you...

1662
02:22:45,492 --> 02:22:51,158
Bliss is awaiting to open,
why are you delaying it?

1663
02:22:52,098 --> 02:22:57,730
l'll tie the knot and
fulfill your wishes...

1664
02:22:58,138 --> 02:23:04,668
l'll show you what Seenu
is capable of...

1665
02:23:04,878 --> 02:23:07,574
He'll promise to show and
smash you...

1666
02:23:07,781 --> 02:23:11,239
He's a crook to the core...

1667
02:23:11,451 --> 02:23:14,477
He's like that, staying away
from him is good for you...

1668
02:23:14,688 --> 02:23:17,680
Stay as far as possible
from him for your good...

1669
02:23:17,891 --> 02:23:21,554
Few more minutes here
and l'll go mad...

1670
02:24:13,346 --> 02:24:17,840
Let anyone think anything,
you were born for me only...

1671
02:24:19,953 --> 02:24:25,289
Where ever you may be,
l'll follow you as your shadow...

1672
02:24:27,193 --> 02:24:31,960
lt's not wrong, you've that right...
l'm father's daughter and your partner...

1673
02:24:32,365 --> 02:24:35,357
The girl is small built and
her father is real big daddy...

1674
02:24:35,568 --> 02:24:38,867
l'll fulfill the wish of
this King's daughter...

1675
02:24:39,272 --> 02:24:42,332
lf you're near me,
my love grows and glows...

1676
02:24:42,542 --> 02:24:46,535
lf son-in-law is ready,
l'll conduct their marriage...

1677
02:24:50,817 --> 02:24:54,480
He'll make a sensible Bhavani
into a mad man...

1678
02:25:29,055 --> 02:25:31,319
l got you boy!

1679
02:25:36,039 --> 02:25:38,507
Just one more dear.
- Enough father!

1680
02:25:38,708 --> 02:25:39,538
No father!

1681
02:25:39,743 --> 02:25:42,678
Your daughter is getting
married tomorrow.

1682
02:25:42,879 --> 02:25:46,144
She's not a little to feed her.

1683
02:25:46,550 --> 02:25:50,077
She's always a little girl to me.

1684
02:25:50,554 --> 02:25:52,715
You asked why do we need

1685
02:25:53,790 --> 02:25:56,054
How this home is celebrating it?
Sandhya too is very happy.

1686
02:25:56,259 --> 02:25:57,521
Why won't they be happy?

1687
02:25:57,727 --> 02:26:00,753
They don't know the truth,
so they're happy.

1688
02:26:00,964 --> 02:26:04,263
Tell them Seenu,
what's happening here?

1689
02:26:04,668 --> 02:26:05,635
Will you tell it yourself
or shall l tell them?

1690
02:26:05,836 --> 02:26:07,804
What's it brother-in-law?
- Brother-in-law!

1691
02:26:08,004 --> 02:26:12,703
Tell them Seenu !
Will you or shall l?

1692
02:26:19,583 --> 02:26:22,051
Why should you or me say it?
Let's ask Sandhya to tell them.

1693
02:26:22,252 --> 02:26:26,689
Sandhya! Tell your father
what's in your heart!

1694
02:26:28,091 --> 02:26:30,651
Yes father,
what Seenu said is right.

1695
02:26:30,861 --> 02:26:34,592
Had l married then,
l would've missed so much in life.

1696
02:26:34,798 --> 02:26:39,292
Seenu taught me what is love
and like in these 10 days,

1697
02:26:40,270 --> 02:26:46,072
had Seenu not entered my life l would've
never known what is love, father.

1698
02:26:47,878 --> 02:26:49,573
Not what l said earlier, father,

1699
02:26:49,779 --> 02:26:51,940
l'm telling you what is in my heart,

1700
02:26:52,148 --> 02:26:55,948
l wish Seenu to be
my husband in every birth !

1701
02:27:06,730 --> 02:27:10,063
Yes father! l want Seenu only!

1702
02:27:20,110 --> 02:27:25,878
l raised Sandhya pampering her
because she was mother less child.

1703
02:27:26,616 --> 02:27:29,084
She 1knew only to be proud
and arrogant,

1704
02:27:29,286 --> 02:27:31,049
she never knew to b
docile or humble,

1705
02:27:32,756 --> 02:27:38,285
but when l heard today,
l feel she has grown up!

1706
02:27:39,963 --> 02:27:47,096
l was always worried if her man
would love her like me.

1707
02:27:48,171 --> 02:27:50,162
You came into her life.

1708
02:27:50,874 --> 02:27:58,781
You're not just my son-in-law,
you're my son !

1709
02:28:18,768 --> 02:28:20,861
l got you boy!

1710
02:28:30,947 --> 02:28:34,348
Sandhya, l came here for Shruthi.

1711
02:28:34,918 --> 02:28:39,082
The moment we fell into the water
tub, l fell in love with you.

1712
02:28:40,190 --> 02:28:41,748
You're my life.

1713
02:28:42,392 --> 02:28:44,087
l can't live without you.

1714
02:28:44,761 --> 02:28:47,992
And l can't live losing to Seenu !

1715
02:28:49,099 --> 02:28:51,897
Because love marriage
is your ambition.

1716
02:28:52,736 --> 02:28:55,170
My ambition is to avenge him.

1717
02:28:55,905 --> 02:28:59,204
lf you want me to win,
tell your father you want Seenu !

1718
02:28:59,409 --> 02:29:00,171
Why?

1719
02:29:00,377 --> 02:29:04,279
Yes Sandhya, Seenu will surely
not marry you,

1720
02:29:04,714 --> 02:29:06,682
he'll come out with truth himself,

1721
02:29:07,117 --> 02:29:11,713
and when your father thrashes him,
l wish to see that scene.

1722
02:29:13,089 --> 02:29:14,750
lf this doesn't happen...

1723
02:29:19,329 --> 02:29:23,231
Our love too would die along with me.

1724
02:29:24,734 --> 02:29:25,894
No, l'll not let it happen.

1725
02:29:27,137 --> 02:29:28,764
l'll do as you say!

1726
02:29:39,749 --> 02:29:44,345
Will my life take a turn
if l dare touch you?

1727
02:29:44,754 --> 02:29:50,056
Did you see l changed your life
without you ever touching me?

1728
02:29:51,961 --> 02:29:57,399
Tomorrow morning you're getting
married, go and sleep.

1729
02:30:10,413 --> 02:30:11,471
What's this son?

1730
02:30:11,881 --> 02:30:14,406
lf you marry Sandhya,
what will happen to Shruthi?

1731
02:30:16,419 --> 02:30:18,785
Come what ever it may,
l'll tell everything to Rajanna.

1732
02:30:18,955 --> 02:30:22,823
Father, if Rajanna comes to
know the truth, he'll kill us.

1733
02:30:23,026 --> 02:30:24,459
What should we do now?

1734
02:30:27,330 --> 02:30:29,195
Marriage must happen at any cost.

1735
02:30:36,840 --> 02:30:38,967
Boss, your plan was damn good.

1736
02:30:40,009 --> 02:30:41,033
Greetings boss.

1737
02:30:41,244 --> 02:30:45,374
Why are you so dull?
We're kinsmen now!

1738
02:30:53,056 --> 02:30:55,456
You don't worry!
Marriage will go on fine.

1739
02:30:55,859 --> 02:30:58,521
Boss! Sandhya madam is missing!

1740
02:30:58,928 --> 02:31:02,159
Sandhya is missing! Find her!

1741
02:31:10,974 --> 02:31:12,908
Find Shruthi boys!

1742
02:31:15,912 --> 02:31:17,880
She's also missing.

1743
02:31:20,216 --> 02:31:21,843
Brother, Mysamma!

1744
02:31:22,085 --> 02:31:23,245
What?

1745
02:31:23,453 --> 02:31:25,546
Will you conduct your
daughter's marriage?

1746
02:31:25,955 --> 02:31:29,823
How can you do it?
Come, let's conduct it here.

1747
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:32,152
Start the vehicles!

1748
02:31:36,266 --> 02:31:38,359
Were you planning to fix my marriage?

1749
02:31:39,869 --> 02:31:41,564
l used Rajanna's enemy Mysamma,

1750
02:31:41,971 --> 02:31:45,065
l've asked him to kidnap Shruthi
also along with Sandhya.

1751
02:31:46,276 --> 02:31:49,302
Let's decide there whether
Shruthi is yours or mine.

1752
02:31:52,615 --> 02:31:54,139
He's ordering to start the vehicles!

1753
02:33:24,540 --> 02:33:26,667
l'm not involved in this,
l'm very sorry.

1754
02:34:09,218 --> 02:34:11,584
lf we've to live we must leave her.

1755
02:34:13,556 --> 02:34:15,456
Don't tell your father.

1756
02:34:16,259 --> 02:34:18,750
Not just you two, l must also live.

1757
02:34:36,079 --> 02:34:37,137
How dare you cheat me!

1758
02:34:37,347 --> 02:34:38,974
l thought you were in love with him.

1759
02:34:39,182 --> 02:34:41,309
But you were born for him.

1760
02:34:49,092 --> 02:34:51,026
Come...come...

1761
02:35:21,124 --> 02:35:24,059
Stop...l did everything as
you said, what's this?

1762
02:35:24,260 --> 02:35:27,491
You're madly in love with me,
your madly loves you,

1763
02:35:27,697 --> 02:35:30,461
does your mad family need me
as your son-in-law?

1764
02:35:31,167 --> 02:35:32,395
Father!

1765
02:35:33,403 --> 02:35:36,031
Catch him boys!

1766
02:35:44,647 --> 02:35:46,410
Move!

1767
02:35:47,183 --> 02:35:49,174
l'll kill him!

1768
02:36:03,766 --> 02:36:05,791
Son-in-law! Kill him!

1769
02:36:19,148 --> 02:36:20,172
What's it dear?

1770
02:36:20,383 --> 02:36:24,820
Though he doesn't love me,
still l love him.

1771
02:36:37,733 --> 02:36:42,432
Bhavani isn't a good man, dear.
He's a goon in the city.

1772
02:36:43,172 --> 02:36:44,605
What do we do then?

1773
02:36:45,208 --> 02:36:47,608
Let him be anything, l want him.

1774
02:36:51,681 --> 02:36:53,808
How am l to convince
my son-in-law now?

1775
02:36:55,318 --> 02:36:57,411
Son-in-law, come with me.

1776
02:36:57,620 --> 02:37:00,384
What's it, father-in-law?
- Come...come.

1777
02:37:04,160 --> 02:37:07,288
Son-in-law, l've done injustice
to Shruthi.

1778
02:37:07,497 --> 02:37:08,896
God has done injustice to me.

1779
02:37:09,332 --> 02:37:10,526
What happened, father-in-law?

1780
02:37:11,267 --> 02:37:16,637
Sandhya wants to marry Bhavani.
- Father-in-law!

1781
02:37:17,607 --> 02:37:19,336
What are you saying?

1782
02:37:19,675 --> 02:37:24,203
Entire place is agog that Seenu
is marrying Sandhya.

1783
02:37:24,413 --> 02:37:25,778
You're changing in the last minute.

1784
02:37:26,716 --> 02:37:28,206
Why don't you say something, dad?

1785
02:37:30,353 --> 02:37:32,753
No father-in-law, Sandhya is
my wife, that's it.

1786
02:37:32,955 --> 02:37:38,291
No son-in-law, if l refuse her wish,
l'll lose her.

1787
02:37:38,494 --> 02:37:41,258
Her life is in your hands, son-in-law.

1788
02:37:44,233 --> 02:37:47,862
Okay, l gave up Shruthi whom
l lov4ed dearly for your sake,

1789
02:37:48,504 --> 02:37:51,496
today again for your sake,
l'm giving up Sandhya.

1790
02:37:52,275 --> 02:37:53,799
Thanks a lot.

1791
02:37:54,243 --> 02:37:55,608
What about my life then?

1792
02:37:55,811 --> 02:37:58,712
l'll unite the lovers l had separated.

1793
02:37:58,915 --> 02:38:02,407
Say yes to this marriage, son-in-law.

1794
02:38:02,919 --> 02:38:06,377
Son-in-law...say yes!

1795
02:38:07,423 --> 02:38:08,617
Okay, father-in-law!

1796
02:38:09,358 --> 02:38:10,689
l'm happy son-in-law!

1797
02:38:12,428 --> 02:38:14,396
What?
- Son-in-law has agreed to marry!

1798
02:38:14,597 --> 02:38:17,566
With whom?
- Who else? With Shruthi.

1799
02:38:17,767 --> 02:38:21,498
He wanted to marry Shruthi, right?
Did he agree now?

1800
02:38:22,004 --> 02:38:24,939
Don't you know about an entire
love track, brother-in-law?

1801
02:38:29,645 --> 02:38:33,775
Son-in-law, you're a good man,
so my daughter is getting married.

1802
02:38:33,983 --> 02:38:35,917
Make a wish, son-in-law.

1803
02:38:36,319 --> 02:38:36,944
Will you give anything
l ask, father-in-law?

1804
02:38:37,353 --> 02:38:38,980
l'll give anything you wish.

1805
02:38:44,860 --> 02:38:45,690
Son-in-law!

1806
02:38:45,895 --> 02:38:48,363
Father-in-law, return his one feet land.

1807
02:38:49,599 --> 02:38:50,588
Father-in-law!

1808
02:38:51,300 --> 02:38:54,895
You've promised me, father-in-law.
- No son-in-law...

1809
02:38:57,473 --> 02:39:01,967
l've promised my son-in-law,
so l'm returning your land. Go!

1810
02:39:02,378 --> 02:39:09,841
Grandpa! Father!
l won !

1811
02:39:10,052 --> 02:39:10,950
For a feet of land?

1812
02:39:13,990 --> 02:39:16,356
Father-in-law, if you give me

1813
02:39:16,559 --> 02:39:17,685
You tie the knot first.

1814
02:39:17,893 --> 02:39:19,451
l'll imprison you for life time.

1815
02:39:32,441 --> 02:39:34,909
Get up...get up...
God bless you !

1816
02:39:35,745 --> 02:39:37,406
What's this?

1817
02:39:38,347 --> 02:39:40,838
l'm not the villain.
You !

1818
02:39:41,050 --> 02:39:43,382
Thank Seenu.

1819
02:39:46,088 --> 02:39:48,454
Shruthi is adamant, she'll not agree.

1820
02:39:48,658 --> 02:39:51,821
They said 1000 lies are okay
to conduct a marriage,

1821
02:39:52,028 --> 02:39:55,691
l'll tell just one lie and unite you.

1822
02:39:56,599 --> 02:39:57,429
Wait.

1823
02:39:57,633 --> 02:40:01,069
Shruthi, Seenu...
- l don't want him.

1824
02:40:01,537 --> 02:40:03,630
He left me for your property.

1825
02:40:03,839 --> 02:40:06,034
He'll leave me again if someone
has more property than you.

1826
02:40:06,442 --> 02:40:09,343
No, Seenu is a diamond!

1827
02:40:09,545 --> 02:40:10,671
l don't believe it.

1828
02:40:10,880 --> 02:40:14,873
Do you know one thing, what ever
he did in home was a drama.

1829
02:40:15,384 --> 02:40:19,115
He asked 10 days time to
set Bhavani with Sandhya.

1830
02:40:22,591 --> 02:40:25,458
He did everything for you only.
lsn't it, son-in-law?

1831
02:40:28,631 --> 02:40:29,893
Yes!

1832
02:40:33,936 --> 02:40:35,426
What do you say now?

1833
02:40:36,072 --> 02:40:37,835
Then, it's okay to me.

1834
02:40:38,441 --> 02:40:42,002
From today l've two daughters
and two sons-in-law.

1835
02:40:42,812 --> 02:40:45,440
He has made the man who
separated them to unite again.

1836
02:40:45,648 --> 02:40:48,845
He's no ordinary man !
- Who do you think Seenu is?

1837
02:40:49,051 --> 02:40:52,509
Seenu is very tough !

1838
02:40:53,000 --> 02:41:52,509
A PuLi-DDR Presentation ;)
